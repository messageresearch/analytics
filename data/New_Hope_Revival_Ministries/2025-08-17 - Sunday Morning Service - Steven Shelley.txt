I thank you that you're my papa. &gt;&gt; God, you have loved me so much &gt;&gt; that you wanted me to come up higher. You wanted me to come into a realm where you are, Lord. You did not want me to remain down with the earthbound creatures. You wanted me to be higher. You wanted me to go higher. You wanted me to walk through an open door. Lord, you knew that there was fear and intimidation that tried to keep me out. And so, Lord, you gave me tests and trials. You gave me something that would help me to become stronger and more courageous so that I could put the devil under my feet and walk through that door. Lord, I thank you for divine love that casts out all fear so that I can walk through the open door that you have created for me to walk through. &gt;&gt; I thank you today that you're a good good papa. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you know all about me. You know all about my loved ones, &gt;&gt; fellow believers, the saints that have been called together. &gt;&gt; You know their individual places, &gt;&gt; the path that you've put them on. But Lord, you have called us as individuals to come up higher. &gt;&gt; And I thank you that you have given us the tests &gt;&gt; to overcome one by one so that we can go higher. That's because you're a good good father. &gt;&gt; You didn't want us to blend into society. &gt;&gt; You wanted us to be above it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not because we're better than someone else, but because Lord, you have placed a high and a holy calling upon our lives. &gt;&gt; As the elect lady, &gt;&gt; we worship you. We worship you. Great is our God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you have a need? As we go to the Lord in prayer today, you just want to lift your hand to the Lord. The Lord sees your hand. He knows your need. Knows how to help you in this hour. Those of you on the stream that are watching this service, the needs that you have, the Lord sees those needs. He's willing and able to help you and give you strength in this hour. You're a good good father. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Will you pray? Um, let let me see just a minute. I'm so sorry, but uh Jesus, we worship you. &gt;&gt; Oh, my sister Terry is she she's here, isn't she? Sister Terry is a new grandmother. I guess she knew that already, did she? Sister Hannah has uh had her baby this morning. Ain't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Wonderful. [Applause] Praise you, Lord. And it's a big thing. I'll tell you that right now. At least it looks that way in the picture. Huh? It's not big. That was a closeup, I guess. Would you pray this morning for Jonathan Hollis whose leg was swelled even larger today and he's in a tremendous amount of pain at times and they just told him it must be some kind of infection in that leg. Let's ask the Lord to to uh give him a miracle today. It's certainly not like him not to be able to be in service for sure. &gt;&gt; So, we want to hold him up to the Lord. And uh David said Ashley didn't sleep very well uh last night and would need some rest and our prayers and I would think that every mother in this room knows how all that works and would show extra compassion toward her. Uh maybe they're streaming. If they are, pray that David will do his part and more and not be a slacker at a time like this. Is he on reckoning? Let's smile at him. um pray for Zach's family, would you? They're they're uh woke up in the middle of the night and were vomiting and they don't want that to spread and so they'd like for us to remember them to the Lord in prayer. Sister Rebecca Shephard is uh it's a bit of a trial because Matthew's leaving today and going off to college and um and and she just needs our prayers. That's that would not be easy and we want to hold her up to the Lord. Brother Bobby uh Wartz, who we mentioned to you the other day, he uh is not getting maybe the best reports. We don't know exactly what's being said, but he does have an appointment this coming week at the Mayo Clinic &gt;&gt; and uh they're going to continue to see what they might do and and and what the prognosis is. But we serve a great big wonderful capable healing Jesus. And I know there are others, but I didn't get a chance to get them all wrote down before I came out today. But let's just lift them up. Even if we don't know each detail, we're going to lift them up. Brother Daniel, that's right. Um when I drove on the property today, he met me near the mailbox and said he was going to be checked out at the emergency room. I prayed for him. He was laded and was having some strange pain around his chest area. And uh I felt like the Lord moved. I really did. But of course, he wanted to double check. And so that's all right. Let's pray that the Lord will heal him. Whatever's going on, he'll just walk out of it with a miracle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to take all of these needs to our papa, our father. He knows all about every one of them. Sing the chorus of this song. Sister Jeffrey usually sings. I know the peace speaker. I know him by name. I know the peace speaker. He controls the wind and waves. When he says peace be still, they have to obey. I know the peace speaker. I know him by name. Brother Hawk, will you come and pray today? I know the peace speaker. I know him by name. I know the peace speaker. He controls the wind and waves. When he says peace be still, they have to obey. [Music] I know the peace speaker. I know him by name. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you that you have revealed your name to us. You have &gt;&gt; What a privilege to know you by name. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. to know you personally. Father, we know you as a loving father, a loving God &gt;&gt; that is full of mercy &gt;&gt; and full of kindness to his children. And we thank you Lord that we know you as a miracle working God. You are &gt;&gt; you are glorified and honored &gt;&gt; when we believe you and your promises for our own individual lives. &gt;&gt; You're honored when we receive them by faith. &gt;&gt; Lord, you went through so much to reveal your love to us. &gt;&gt; Yes, you did. to come into this earth. Humble yourself as a servant. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Manifest yourself as a lamb. &gt;&gt; What a mystery. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But so big it was love that took you all the way to the cross. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; May we see that it was your love to us. &gt;&gt; May all of us see it for our oursel. It was your love for us. &gt;&gt; And in that love, you healed us. And right now, there are people that need healing in their bodies. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And Father, in that name that you reveal to us in the name of Yeshua. &gt;&gt; Oh God, we ask that you would heal those that are needy right now. for brother Bobby right now. May the miracle working power of the almighty God manifest in his body right now in the name of Yeshua healing &gt;&gt; wholeness &gt;&gt; for brother Jonathan &gt;&gt; to manifest yourself for brother Daniel &gt;&gt; but father I just want to thank you right now what you're doing inside of our heart you're making yourself so real. I want to thank you for revelation. &gt;&gt; You want to be known. &gt;&gt; And father, we want to know you intimately. We want to know everything about you. And father, we love you today. We bless you for who you are. We thank you for your goodness in our life. &gt;&gt; Let the purposes of God unfold in this service &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We praise you, Lord. We praise you, Lord. Thank you for hearing our prayer. Thank you for meeting the needs, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you as you have your seat today. &gt;&gt; Sister Flo, you going to come and sing? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We're glad to have you in the house of the Lord with us today. &gt;&gt; Jenna has her mother, Sister Melinda, and her sister Joy. We're glad that they're here visiting with us. May the Lord bless you. [Applause] Tiffany, is this Joshua's son that your nephew? All right, Jeremiah, we're glad that you're here today. God bless you. [Applause] And Jaden has some friends with him today. We welcome them, asking the Lord to bless them while they're here. Jessica, it's nice to see you and the grandbaby here with us today. God bless you. &gt;&gt; I'm glad that I'm a believer &gt;&gt; in the Lord Jesus Christ. Everybody's a believer in something, &gt;&gt; but I'm glad that I'm a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, the one true living God who gives us the help and strength that we need every day of our life to keep pressing on. And that's what we do. We press on by the grace of God. God bless you, Sister Flo. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I was reading the scripture. I believe it was yesterday. And I want to say this, and I want you to really take it to heart. I was reading where God was telling all the animals to go into the ark. Um, Moses, he told Moses how to build the ark. &gt;&gt; Noah, &gt;&gt; I mean Noah. Thank you, brother Shel. And [Music] sometime I think when we read we kind of skip things or &gt;&gt; it just don't click or something. No telling how many times I've read it, but it just clicked within me. We as human beings, we think we smart and we think, you know, we know a lot. We do. We do cuz we've listened and read and studied and but I read something that I had never noticed before. Have you ever wondered I know I know you you think you know. Have you ever wondered how all those animals all those bugs and gnats and flies and &gt;&gt; mosquitoes and all of that? How did how did it all gather together and go into the art? Have you ever thought about that? I mean, just think about how many bugs there are in the world. I hope all the roach bugs go somewhere. I hate them things. But anyway, I got to thinking about that and it says that the Lord moved on them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about how important it is for God to move on you? Like the song says, without him, we are nothing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We don't have no goal or nothing. But I just thank God with all my heart. &gt;&gt; I'm a fail. I probably fail God more than any of you here. I feel that way. And when we get to thinking we don't, there's something wrong with us. &gt;&gt; But I thank God. I don't know how to thank him. And I tell him, I don't know how to thank you for calling me &gt;&gt; and choosing me and filling me &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; with your precious spirit. &gt;&gt; I hope I do this good. I want to because you're the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It makes me nervous to sing before you because you are the bride. &gt;&gt; Praise God. All right, sister. your only son. No sin to hide. But you have sent him from your side to walk upon this guilty son and to become the lamb of God. Oh lamb of God, sweet lamb of God. I love the holy lamb of God. Oh, wash me in his precious blood. My Jesus Christ, the lamb of God. [Music] your gift of love. They crucified. They laughed and scorned him as he died. The humble king. They named a fraud and sacrificed the lamb of God. Oh lamb of God. Sweet lamb of God. I love the holy lamb of God. Oh, wash be his precious blood. &gt;&gt; My Jesus Christ, the lamb of God. I was so lost. I should have died, but you have brought me to your side to be led by your staff and rod &gt;&gt; and to be called a lamb. Oh lamb of God, sweet lamb of God. I love the holy lamb of God. Oh, wash me. His precious blood. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; By Jesus Christ, the lamb of God. Oh lamb of God. Sweet lamb of God. I love that hope lamb of God. Oh, wash me in his precious blood. My Jesus Christ, the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, wash me in his precious blood. My Jesus Christ the lamb. &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Sister Flo. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful that God has vessels that have stood the test of time. &gt;&gt; Someone like Sister Flo that still wants to sing for the glory of God. I'm like her. I live for the presence of the Lord &gt;&gt; to be in his presence. I'm &gt;&gt; grateful for his mercy that he would call me as he has called you out of the millions and billions of people in the world. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we question why. Why would he call us? It has to be the sovereignty and election of God. &gt;&gt; That he he knew. He knew all of my makeup. He knew all of what I was made of. knew where to put me and how to put me and what trials to take me through that would build me into exactly what he wanted me to be &gt;&gt; because he knew what he had called. &gt;&gt; I'm grateful for that. &gt;&gt; Brother Ellas, would you help us today? And brother Ian will let the these brothers come to you today for the tithe and the offering we give as unto the Lord. The Lord has blessed us to be able to uh have our substance and everything that we have is because of him and we gladly give him the tithe. It belongs to him. It wasn't ours to start with. It belongs to him and we add an offering there too because that we love him and we're thankful for what he has done for us. May the Lord bless you as you give to the Lord today. Let's worship together as we are preparing our hearts for the preaching of the word. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You call the sun to rise. You hold this heart of mine. And you lay it down to rest.

Yes, we're desperate. &gt;&gt; We're so grateful. [Music] &gt;&gt; My God, you always supply. &gt;&gt; I'm lost without you. &gt;&gt; You supply everything we need. I'm lost without you. And I lost &gt;&gt; without you. Praise God I am. Let's give the Lord a praise with our hands clapping like the Bible said. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Monitor. Like the Bible said, we are so thankful that he has daily bread. Yes. &gt;&gt; When Jesus was in the temptation and the enemy promised him what he really didn't have to give, Jesus resisted him by saying clearly. I don't know why this thing keeps getting so out of whack. Man shall not live by bread alone, &gt;&gt; but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God. That's daily bread. That's living bread. &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful for it. And it's better than any biscuit you've ever had. I'll tell you that right now. Uh amen. Let's thank God for the musicians. [Applause] I want you to get your Bible ready. While you're standing, we're going to go to Jeremiah 48:1. And then we're going to First Peter chapter 2. We're very happy to see you in the house of the Lord today and glad for the presence of God. And this has been a week, hasn't it? We're alive and well. And we've got much to be thankful for. Nothing really to complain about. Even though there are troubles and trials and burdens that come along, uh we are blessed above blessed above blessed, we're thankful to have him, to know him and the power of his salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're getting ready to enter not because it's my part, because it's his part, but we're getting ready to enter into the most important part of this service. &gt;&gt; And we are missing a lot of folks today. There's a lot of different things going on, but God's going to bring every one of them through &gt;&gt; and we have a brand new baby boy born into the uh New Hope local family. We're so thankful for God blessing Ashley and David with a healthy baby boy. And uh I guess you have seen his name is Abel Joshua Yantis. And we're thankful for him and may he be able &gt;&gt; to do everything God would lay on his life to do. Amen. And then to have another precious little baby born today to our streaming family one day hopefully local but streaming family for now. And we're excited about that as well. And uh this has been a season, these last few weeks has been an unusual season spiritually. God's doing something for a lot of people. It's just a sovereign thing that he's doing. And of course, that can make you There's all kinds of reactions that take place when people start drawing closer to the Lord. Backlash. You know, the enemy comes and he tries to distract them and hinder them in many ways. And I've been particularly nervous for the last three days, but I know that there is victory on the other side. And we cannot lose focus now. We've got to keep our eyes on the prize &gt;&gt; because he's stepping out again from behind the lattice. &gt;&gt; If you missed him before, maybe you won't miss him this time. Recognize who he is. And this is not something we do for a hobby. We don't go to church by hobby. In fact, we don't just come unprepared. We don't come on a dry run. We prepare our hearts to be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you didn't, that may be why you're so distracted. But we prepared our hearts to be here today because we knew he would be here. &gt;&gt; And who would want to miss his appointment? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to ask you that if you're a person that needs to go in and out of the building that you make it a habituh moving forward to sort of sit closer to the back. It doesn't really matter today. we have plenty of room for you, but it is very distracting at times if someone goes out three, four, five times during a sermon. Uh you may need to get in a healing line or you may need to see a doctor. Um I know we have long services. I understand that. And most of the time we just can kind of come up a little bit above it. But uh just lately there's just a whole lot of movement. I want you moving, but I want you moving in the spirit toward the Lord. And I'm not trying to chastise you. I'm just trying to tell you. I mean, if I were in a place uh and what I was doing was was really causing distraction to the person responsible, I I would want to know it so I could adjust myself. &gt;&gt; This is not a place to lay on one another. &gt;&gt; Uh somebody said, "What if we're married?" I I said, "This is not a place &gt;&gt; to lay on one another. &gt;&gt; This is a house of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got your home, your your living room, your bedroom, your car. If you feel like you need to be laying on one another, you can do that if you're married. If you're not, the Bible forbids it. &gt;&gt; Bible forbids it. &gt;&gt; And I I want to stay with the word, don't you? This isn't fun that we're not just playing here. We're getting ready for a translation. &gt;&gt; And I want to be right in the middle of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we love you. We love everybody. And we it disturbs us to think that you might be fighting something physical. But if you are, you you don't need to be right up in the front. You need to find a place so that you can get in and out toward the back. Uh because not only are there people here trying to focus, but there are people on the stream who are really pulling with everything they've got &gt;&gt; because they don't get to enjoy the full atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Uh it's good. But I feel the anointings coming through even in archive when we're worshiping the Lord. But it's there's nothing like being in the middle of it. &gt;&gt; And and just when you feel like you just want to rest and be a little slack, just remember there are dozens of people who would love to have your spot &gt;&gt; and would want to take full advantage of it for a little while until they got spoiled. &gt;&gt; That's just kind of the way it works, isn't it? &gt;&gt; But we're looking for great things. We believe it's going to be the greatest camp meeting that we've ever had. We believe that it is a very, very prophetic hour and that God is doing lots of things. I want to be right in the middle of it. &gt;&gt; And if you've got another focus, you better you better make some adjustments. &gt;&gt; You really had because you don't want to miss what God is doing in this hour. &gt;&gt; It's big. &gt;&gt; I know it. I don't just think it. I know it. Uh, God bless every one of you who are streaming. I would I would take time to mention it, but may I just say it like this? We have folks uh as far away as Australia and Japan both on this morning. Uh UK um I I South Africa uh and Ghana and that's just on that's just on on Facebook. So we have a some other platforms where people are greeting us God's goodness and blessings to all of you. Jeremiah 48:11. We are in a series uh concerning uh well, just to boil it down, we're making wine. We're making wine for the King of Kings &gt;&gt; and the Lord of Lords. And we're desperate for him and we're thirsty for him and we're lost without him. as we sung. We want our praise to be like ointment for his feet. &gt;&gt; As the song says, wine for him to drink. &gt;&gt; We're trying to allow him to get us ready. We can't get ready ourselves unless we surrender to him. &gt;&gt; And so, we have thoroughly covered the first vessel. And this is called racking. And it's where wine is poured from one vessel to another vessel. each time enhancing the process of fermentation. And we have thoroughly covered the vessel of misunderstanding. &gt;&gt; And and we're not we weren't finished with the notes, but we're moving on today. Uh we got hung up around the tent, the pavilion, the hiding place, the secret place of the Lord. And I'm not done with it, but I'm just going to move on for now because there's something very, very fresh on that for this hour, for this season. Uh but I feel like today we should move uh just a bit to the next vessel. But let's get the theme. Moab hath been at ease from his youth and he hath settled on his leaves. And that's the dregs as we have discovered for anyone uh not hearing this. That's the dregs that's left behind. It can be little pieces of the skin. It can be all kinds of uh debris that might get in the crushing process. Of course, in the Bible, it was crushed by the foot, by feet, and outside. And so, anything could get in. And those leaves, if they stay there, those drags will make the wine bitter. So Moab is the cousin to Israel, the other side of the Dead Sea, and he has never been dealt with. But God is about to deal with him according to Jeremiah's prophecy. And he said the reason why you've fared so well is you just remained in one vessel, but now it's time for you to be poured out of your maybe your comfort zone or what you've grown used to &gt;&gt; and be poured into something altogether different. uh you have not been emptied from vessel to vessel neither hath he gone into captivity. Therefore his taste remained in him and his scent is not changed. What we know about wine making is the fragrance is as important as the taste and God wants to make transformation in us. Now go to first Peter I know you're still standing. 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 11 and 12. Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts. That could be the word desires also. which war again, notice not against the spirit. &gt;&gt; The spirit has been regenerated &gt;&gt; by the spirit of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You don't have the same spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know the controversy. &gt;&gt; I understand it. But the scriptures are clear. The war takes place not in spirit. &gt;&gt; You'll hear brother Bam saying that sometime, but he's talking about the soul. because the spirit has died and a new spirit. That's what the scripture said. &gt;&gt; You've now put the life of Christ in there and that old spirit has been transfigured. &gt;&gt; You now carry the gene of God. &gt;&gt; It's pretty powerful. Your your natural DNA has been overrode, overridden by spiritual DNA. &gt;&gt; That means you can believe God for anything he promises in his word. Because that word has now become a part of you. You have now become a part of that word. Where does the war come? The war comes against the soul &gt;&gt; which is the mind, the will and the emotions. &gt;&gt; Now you think about what you're going through right now other than a physical sickness. If you're going through any other trial and it can also affect you, a physical sickness can affect you in that way. But any other trial that you're going through and you boil it down, is it is it in the regenerated spirit that Christ has placed within you? It couldn't be because there's no struggle in him. &gt;&gt; So the struggle has to be in the soul, the mind, &gt;&gt; the will, &gt;&gt; and the emotions. &gt;&gt; Either God's trying to get you to do something that you don't want to do, and that will is that stubborn will is kicking in, or your mind is lying to you. stinking thinking is getting you down &gt;&gt; or you're being led by emotion. &gt;&gt; I tell you, I'm sick and tired of that kind of reactions. Aren't you in my life? &gt;&gt; I want to I want to respond according to the word. &gt;&gt; All right. The next verse said, "Having your conversation honest, God is calling for total honesty in this hour. Total integrity &gt;&gt; in this hour. &gt;&gt; No hypocrisy. having your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, that they may by your good works. &gt;&gt; We're not saved by works, &gt;&gt; but we testify of salvation and faith by our works, &gt;&gt; that they may know by your good works, which they shall &gt;&gt; behold. It's not secret works. Amen. &gt;&gt; They're going to see them. And by that, may they glorify God in the day of visitation. &gt;&gt; And we are still living in the day of visitation for the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; We're still in the Gentile the closing hours of the Gentile church age. &gt;&gt; And so this is still a part of our day of visitation. It's time for the Gentiles to shine the good works of Jesus Christ. So that the Jews become jealous. Scripture said so. &gt;&gt; That they would inquire of us. &gt;&gt; What's this faith in you? &gt;&gt; How are you able to come through these things? With the joy of the Lord. Father, thank you today that your word is more than just a written record. It is a living force &gt;&gt; that is inside of the believer by the Holy Spirit. Thank you, Father, for the quickening life of your word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we are here today, minds a bit scattered by the weak. Ju just we're just honest before you, transparent before you. There have been all kinds of different things going on in everybody's life this week. But we have come today not to focus on that, not to complain about it, not to belly ache about it, but we have come today to get above it. &gt;&gt; And the only thing we know of that gets us above it is to be lost in you. &gt;&gt; So we throw ourselves right now, we throw ourselves, all that we are, we throw it on you and your mercy. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Ha. And we thank you for the transforming life that lives within the very inside of the inside of us. May it now move forward. May it move outward. May it affect and control the soul realm, the realm of mind, will, and emotion. and and may the Holy Ghost so take over in that realm that that control emanates to the body to the flesh and we pull it into submission to the inner spirit. And when we do that, we can do what Paul told us to do. We can get away. We can abstain from those things, those desires, those pulls that war against the soul. Help us. Help us, sweet Lord. Help us today. We ask these things uh in the name above every name, the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Bashim Adonai Yeshua Hamashiach. You may be seated this evening, this morning, this what will be evening in a minute or two. It's 12:15. So you you call it whatever you want to call it. We are looking today a at the vessel of public gaze. Now the vessel of misunderstanding, we move we move past it finally after several months and we understand that that was a a vessel that was dark uh particularly in a wealthy uh family. It would have been glass and it would have been colored glass and that was in darkness and it was kind of um almost deceptive in the sense that you couldn't tell very much about what was going on in the wine or even the color of the wine or the life that was bubbling in the wine because you were looking through a lens. &gt;&gt; And we might call that colored glass misunderstanding. And and all of God's children have to be at one time or another and sometimes more than one time. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Sometime we have to come back to that place where we are misunderstood. &gt;&gt; People see what we do and hear what we say and they they decide our motive and they uh they judge our motive &gt;&gt; which is the only kind of judgment the Bible talks about. &gt;&gt; Uh you know Christians like to say the Bible said don't judge. It didn't actually say it like that. &gt;&gt; Uh that would be a sweeping statement. And uh it also tells us to judge &gt;&gt; with a righteous judgment, with a spiritual judgment. Amen. But what Jesus said in Matthew 7 is uh if you look at that in the original language, you'll find out he says you you are not to judge motives &gt;&gt; for what you see &gt;&gt; or what you hear. And that's where we struggle &gt;&gt; because we hear somebody say something we say I know why she said that. &gt;&gt; Well, when you start entering into that I know why a place you have ventured into that assumption of knowing someone's intention and motive. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; And you may or may not know. And if you do know, you're still not allowed to call it out. The reason is that is reserved for God the creator. He alone sees the the intents. &gt;&gt; The word of God discerns and knows even the secret thoughts and the intents the intentions of the heart. You and I, if we judge not according to the spirit, but if we judge in the natural, we judge by what we hear, by what we say, by what we perceive, by what we understand. And all of that is based on how we were raised, &gt;&gt; what kind of family environment we've created. Come on. &gt;&gt; And so it's prejudice. &gt;&gt; We're prejudiced toward one another based on our own bias. &gt;&gt; And so that misunderstanding, that's a that's a tough place to be because you want to jump up on the a chair or the couch and you want to beat your chest like a gorilla and you want to say, "Hey, listen to me. That is not what I meant." But but if you do that, uh you're going to mess your balance up &gt;&gt; spiritually because you the one thing you're not allowed to do in a moment like that is defend your way out of the trial. &gt;&gt; You got to live your way out. &gt;&gt; Sounds like work. It is. &gt;&gt; But eternity is worth the work. &gt;&gt; We don't have to work to get saved, &gt;&gt; but to be wine in his cup. Come on now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To be trusted with the full manifestation of the creative spoken word of God, &gt;&gt; we're going to have to pass the test. &gt;&gt; And that means not defending ourselves. &gt;&gt; And and and and and it's particularly hard when you know it's a misunderstanding and you know you could solve it. &gt;&gt; Now, you can try if you got the right spirit. You can say, you know, brother, that's not what I meant. Oh, I know what you meant. See, it just becomes a snowball. &gt;&gt; The best thing to do is live differently. Learn from this moment and do everything you can to to not be sliming around in the shadows. &gt;&gt; Get on out there in the in the real world and live this life for Jesus Christ. Uh, quit trying to veil everything with a cloak of secrecy &gt;&gt; because I want you to know demons multiply in a in a place that we keep hiding. &gt;&gt; You know, the only way to get rid of the pests is to shine the light on them. &gt;&gt; How many of you know they scatter? Then &gt;&gt; Sister Flo was talking about the roaches. Well, I don't like to think about them &gt;&gt; cuz we just had some kind of crazy thing happen uh uh with some shingles that came to our house for a new roof. And we're not talking about dozens, we're talking about thousands. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and I've never seen anything like it on the fig tree. And I and I was beginning to see too many in the house. And we just had to have a major major major uh you know uh I don't know what all you call it spraying and a blowing and a dusting and a uh I don't I don't care. I don't like chemicals but I don't like roaches. &gt;&gt; I just took lots of baths and drank a lot of water and just tried the best I could. But praise God I don't want them things. &gt;&gt; You turn on the light. That's what happens when you Don't tell nobody. Don't tell nobody. Don't tell anybody. Don't tell nobody. When you live like that, I hope you can hear this. &gt;&gt; Don't tell them about I don't want to know. I don't myself. When you create that kind of environment, you raise your children in that kind of environment. Guess what? They don't tell you everything either. and you think they're playing something innocent on the game &gt;&gt; until you find their notebook &gt;&gt; and you find they're drawing uh uh you know public shootings and de demonic looking creatures and &gt;&gt; then you realize, hey, there's a lot more going on. But every but you've raised them in this environment of don't know. &gt;&gt; It's getting quiet, ain't it? &gt;&gt; And when you raise them that way, you make them secretive. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be creating an environment where they can tell you as a parent everything. &gt;&gt; And and in order for that environment to be created, you can't respond out of the emotion. &gt;&gt; You got to say, "Thank you for telling me." and then you got to deal with it. &gt;&gt; That's honesty. That's in the light. &gt;&gt; That's where God's children conduct their business. &gt;&gt; Whether it's family business or spiritual business, in the light. &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, you could take some generational and iniquity curses off of your family, off of your home right now if you would make up your mind to create a transparent environment. Yes. &gt;&gt; Just tell it. &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; And and when you've got when you've got one member of a household triangulating by saying to someone else in the household, now I need you to tell them that I said so and so or I need you to make sure that when you explain it, you you you tell it like I have told it. Folks, that's not honest. &gt;&gt; That's not walking circumspectly before the Lord. That's not walking in integrity. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; We're talking about letting your yay be yay and your nay be nay. &gt;&gt; And what does it matter? I don't want everybody knowing my business. Well, they don't have to know your bill paying business. &gt;&gt; But they need to know sometime that you're in a struggle &gt;&gt; and you're fighting your way through. &gt;&gt; And if you're a person who's always fighting something and always in a battle, be careful. Be careful with that because it's like a wolf. It's like a boy crying wolf. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to give you some wisdom, practical wisdom for this hour. &gt;&gt; Uh you you're like somebody crying wolf. You're like Chicken Little running around. The sky is falling. The sky is falling. Or you cry wolf wolf and everybody runs out to kill the wolf and there's no wolf there because you have overexaggerated the seriousness of the trial. &gt;&gt; We do that sometimes. &gt;&gt; Why are you even preaching like this? Because I get so tired of hearing the same sermon all the time about how God has opened the word. Because if you don't know how to live according to that word in a practical way, &gt;&gt; you may know more than the denominational man, &gt;&gt; but you may not be living any higher than he's living. &gt;&gt; God sent this word and opened it to us a generation ago so that we could take it and become it &gt;&gt; and live above it &gt;&gt; and above all of the circumstances of life. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; I believe that. I believe there's grace in Gan &gt;&gt; for many of the plagues. &gt;&gt; And if there's not enough offered in Goan, just across the river there, just across the sea, there is a promised land that we can get in. There is a pavilion. There is a tabernacle. There is a sanctuary. There is a hiding place. There is a refuge. There is a secret place. There is a tent vision. There's a place to get. &gt;&gt; There's a place to be. And I want to be there. And I don't want to just visit there twice a week. &gt;&gt; I want to live there. So, we've got to learn also how to take this great revelation of the word and not be puffed up with bride pride, &gt;&gt; but begin to bring it down to such a place where we can live it very practically &gt;&gt; in our life with our children, with our grandchildren, with our with our church faith community. Because in an environment like that where we know when someone stumbles, we know and we go to prayer and we don't condemn and we don't judge motives and we don't put them in hell, but we begin to try to rescue them first in prayer &gt;&gt; before you put your mouth on any situation as a believer. &gt;&gt; We go to prayer first &gt;&gt; and we ask God for wisdom. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, he's got it. &gt;&gt; He is the ancient of days. Amen. &gt;&gt; He has all wisdom in his hands. &gt;&gt; All wisdom. And he knows how to help us. &gt;&gt; So, it's one thing to be in a place of misunderstanding, but that's kind of a secret place because there's a lot going on inside of you that people can't see. So, they assume to know what's going on inside of you cuz the glass is dark. But when God pours you out of it, brother, sister, &gt;&gt; the next step &gt;&gt; is no more darkness, &gt;&gt; no more hiding behind the colored glass, &gt;&gt; no more pretending to be what we're not. &gt;&gt; Come on. the heart. Not only is your lifestyle exposed, but the very the very heart your your very heart issues &gt;&gt; are exposed &gt;&gt; when you're poured into the vessel of public gaze. &gt;&gt; In the last vessel, you are judged for what people assume and presume and speculate. But in this season, you are inspected and evaluated on what's really there. &gt;&gt; Now you decide which you like better. &gt;&gt; Is it better to be misunderstood or is it better to be out in the view so everybody can see what's really going on in there? You know, we need a camera to follow you to Walmart when somebody takes your parking space and you jump out and act like you lost your mind. We need that on camera cuz that's the vessel of public gaze &gt;&gt; and everybody knows. And you didn't think to look over your shoulder to see if the church folks are there &gt;&gt; and you just showed out. And that's that's good. Somebody say it's not good. It is good &gt;&gt; because if it's in there, it needs to come out. &gt;&gt; And you and I have got to be sensitive enough to when that stuff comes out, then we got to go to God. &gt;&gt; I still got anger issues. &gt;&gt; I'm still prejudice. &gt;&gt; Coach, you've you've done this. Wouldn't have happened if it hadn't been a different ethnicity uh uh to took the place, you know, the parking place. It it just had to be, you know, uh so forth and etc. Is everybody listening? &gt;&gt; Well, that's what I expected. Well, you know, the only thing is they just beat you to doing it. You you you've done the same. &gt;&gt; You've said I You can wait. You've decided that it was your turn when it wasn't your turn. &gt;&gt; Come on. If that person in a four-way stop didn't move fast enough for you, &gt;&gt; did you motion &gt;&gt; or did you shoot out? Well, anyway, it's called the vessel of public gaze. &gt;&gt; And if it's in there, you want it revealed. If it's a hard issue, you want it revealed because a hard issue is going to keep us from being completely filled with the Holy Ghost. Or you can have a portion. Brother Bam talks about it. You can have a portion. You can even get it on your flesh. &gt;&gt; You can get the Holy Ghost on the on the middle part of who you are. Uh most around this message call it your spirit. We call it according to the scripture your soul. But remember it's not what you call it. It's knowing how it functions. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you get that, you get that uh situation going, the mind, will, and the emotion, you need all the Holy Ghost you can get on that &gt;&gt; so you can get it on your soul. &gt;&gt; And that can be very temporary. But when it's in that spirit, &gt;&gt; then the spirit turns around, that regenerated spirit in Jesus Christ, it now re it turns around and and starts leading the rest of who you are &gt;&gt; into God. And you're all right. You're you you're all right until that soul kicks in again. And and that's why we have to feed our spirit, &gt;&gt; the inside of the inside more than we feed our soul, &gt;&gt; mind, will, and emotion. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that feeds the spirit, man, like the atmosphere of worship and the reality of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Everything else, not necessarily sin, but everything else generally appeals to either the soul or the flesh. it makes us emotionally uh lifted or so forth and etc. And uh that can last for a very short amount of time. But there's a joy that gets down on the inside of the inside of the inside. No matter what you call it, whatever that compartment is, there's a joy that gets down in there. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And see, depression is always in the middle ground. I got to hurry. &gt;&gt; Depression is always in the middle ground. It always operates mind, will, and emotion. &gt;&gt; That's right. And you know what it's trying to do? It's trying to pull the spirit down. Well, why would it do that? Because it's in the process of full sanctification. &gt;&gt; I know if you go to the Baptist church, they tell you it's all done at one time. But I've been living this thing 50 years now nearly, and it ain't all taken care of at one time. &gt;&gt; This is a process. I'm still, you know what? I'm still kicking things out. Yes, &gt;&gt; I'm still telling things to get out of here. Debt, debt, debt. &gt;&gt; That's not who I am in Christ. &gt;&gt; I refuse to be a slave &gt;&gt; to somebody else's prejudice. &gt;&gt; I refuse to be a slave to somebody else's family mess. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes people want to tell, well, that's how we do it in my house. I want to ask you a question. How's it working? &gt;&gt; Is it working? If it's working, keep doing it. If it's not working, you might ought to come back to the word and do it the word way &gt;&gt; because we have a promise if we do it the word way. &gt;&gt; If you look at that promise in the original in the King James, it just simply says, you know, train a child, raise a child in the way he should go and and and when he is old, he'll not depart. Something along those lines. &gt;&gt; But in the original, it actually says something like this. And while they are growing old, &gt;&gt; you know that's everybody in the room. Did you know they're grow? Did you know that uh Abel Joshua is growing old? &gt;&gt; And he just born &gt;&gt; because after birth from there on &gt;&gt; I don't want to depress anybody. &gt;&gt; But it's that process. &gt;&gt; It doesn't wait till you're three to start or 30 to start. It starts immediately. things start moving in that direction and and may God give every one of you and and everybody you know a long life &gt;&gt; but the reality is because it's really the way the creator designed us dying all the time and thank God for the ones that are able to reproduce &gt;&gt; healthy cells &gt;&gt; otherwise they reproduce the wrong kind of cells the ones that are already mutated by disease and cancer we want holy holy fresh ripe you So well whole helpselves &gt;&gt; now while he is growing old he will not depart from it. That's a promise you ought to hold on to. &gt;&gt; I I I would say you ought to start on that journey now if you haven't already by by training them. And training them is not just teaching them. Teaching them is sitting them down and telling them how it is. &gt;&gt; That's teaching. &gt;&gt; That's right. That doesn't have a whole lot of impact &gt;&gt; with every mind &gt;&gt; because children learn different, listen different, &gt;&gt; and if they're caught up in this hour, their attention span is less than 30 seconds. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's your dumb phone did it. &gt;&gt; And so you got to find So the best way is not just tell them how it ought to be done. Show them. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you're whipping your children and not telling them why they're being disciplined, you're actually instilling an anger in them that they're going to have to deal with the rest of their life. &gt;&gt; But if you'll explain to them, not at your convenience, &gt;&gt; but at that moment, &gt;&gt; you'll begin to explain to them what God's word said and why you're being punished. Do you understand why you're being punished? Tell me why you're being punished. you tell me back. Then one or two things is going to happen. The need for the actual corporal punishment may not even be there anymore because you may see a light come on. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be glorious? &gt;&gt; I don't care what age the child. You may see a light come on. &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean you'll never have to say it again, but it means you opened a door. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. you you opened a door and that door is worth opening and keeping open &gt;&gt; because I'm telling you, Satan, one of the things that came out in those visions that we've been going over privately, all all of us at Benjamin's uh uh request, he said, I think we should revisit them and and uh and and I hope that you've been doing that. I've been doing it myself. And one of the things that has stood out to me was one of the commissions that God had given us was to build stronger families. Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, if you try to preach something or teach something that builds stronger families, you've got to wade through everybody's opinion to get there. &gt;&gt; And and then you got to deal with that backlash. Well, I know for a fact, Brother Shelley didn't always do it that way. I know for a fact you were right. There are times that my wife and I sit like old people in chairs and weep together &gt;&gt; because we realized we made mistakes. &gt;&gt; And we realize how long ago? Um 10 days. &gt;&gt; No more than two weeks since the last time. It becomes overwhelming when you realize you you you've missed that opportunity &gt;&gt; and now you've got to approach it from an entirely different way. &gt;&gt; You don't have necessarily a dependent anymore. &gt;&gt; Now you've got an adult. &gt;&gt; And it's an entirely different thing. I beg you, I implore you, I plead with you in the name of Jesus Christ, if you've got small children, don't miss your opportunity now. Don't miss it now to instill everything you can get in them &gt;&gt; while you have an opportunity. And may I suggest that some of you take on the biblical responsibility of training your children at home? &gt;&gt; It's going to get quiet now. I can't find anywhere in God's word where God told the Israelites, "Get out of Egypt." And they get out there in the desert somewhere. And and the next morning or a few mornings later, they get all their children up, wash their faces, and dress them and send them back to Egypt &gt;&gt; to be trained how to live a godly life. It's a huge responsibility. &gt;&gt; And somebody said, "Well, let's let them find their way on their own." Get out of here, you wrong world view. You &gt;&gt; don't you come in here saying, "Let them find out on their own." &gt;&gt; The Bible didn't say, "Let everybody find out the hard way." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible tells us, "Set the example for one another and do it right. &gt;&gt; And when you fail, tell them. I blew it. I absolutely blew it. And wait till one of your children says, "You want me to pray for you, Daddy?" You better say, "Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. We need it. We're in this thing together. I I don't know who that was for, but uh the rest of you don't shovel it over your your your shoulder &gt;&gt; because this is the I'm telling you, this is the hour. This is actually the most important generation &gt;&gt; perhaps that there that there's ever been. &gt;&gt; It is more important than the 50s and 60s. &gt;&gt; And I know that's hard for some folks around the message to say, but it is. It's much more important because the word that God delivered in that generation is more precious and more applicable even to the day and hour we're living in right now than it ever was. And if it's ever going to produce the life of Christ, it has to do it now. If there's ever going to be overcoming Christians, they have to be in this hour. If there's ever going to be fully adopted sons, they've got to step up now. No. [Applause] Because perhaps you that have seen a few of your grandchildren come along, you may actually that may be it. &gt;&gt; They may be the last. &gt;&gt; They may represent the last of the generations. &gt;&gt; We're coming nearer and nearer to that moment of translation. Well, I've heard that all my life. Well, what are you doing about it? What did you do about it then? And what are you doing about it now? Vitally important. God will pour you into that vessel of public gaze. Uh it wasn't a colored glass. It was a shallow wide mouththed. And when these notes are finished, you can have them. And they're almost 200 pages long. Now you can you can you can have a file. I'm not printing it for you unless you you pay for it. Can you imagine print and paper if everybody said I'll take a set of those at Well, I guess I could take it down to normal font. It is a 13, so I can see it in a in a moment of glancing down. If I took that down to like a book or novel or something, I might could get it in 50 pages or so. Who knows? It's a shallow, wide-mouthed fermentation vessel made from various materials including clay, stone, concrete, or even glass. In modern times, that shallow, wide-mouthed, open vessel is generally made out of stainless steel. The wide shallow design, and we're talking about shallow like this in Bible days. It would be deeper, I'm sure, in modern stainless steel. The wide shallow design ensured both even and balanced fermentation. If you're going to learn balance, learn it in the vessel of public gaze. &gt;&gt; While everybody's looking, get your balance and keep it. &gt;&gt; So you can you can put away some of your brandisms. &gt;&gt; You don't always have to wear the costume. Right? &gt;&gt; You don't always have to have on a cowboy hat and a bolo tie and a big eagle belt buckle. &gt;&gt; You can if you like, but you don't always have to do that because we're not patterning after a man. &gt;&gt; We're patterning after the word. &gt;&gt; The God that was in him is what I'm following. &gt;&gt; The word that came out of him from heaven is what I'm agreeing with. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The man was flawed. The vessel was flawed. And if he wasn't, then he was never of this world. &gt;&gt; Because Moses was flawed &gt;&gt; and Noah was flawed and the apostles were flawed. &gt;&gt; He was a sinner saved by grace, highly favored, chosen, and called of God. &gt;&gt; He didn't come so we would walk like him and talk like him and dress like him. He didn't come so that all that would come out of our mouth. As brother Bram said, Brother Bram said, Brother Bram said, &gt;&gt; he came so that we could get a hold of this word, we could eat it &gt;&gt; and digest it and unpack it until we become it. &gt;&gt; The living word. &gt;&gt; That's the trans that's the transformation that has to take place in this hour. &gt;&gt; And the only way I know is to spend enough time &gt;&gt; in that pavilion. Amen. &gt;&gt; In that secret place, &gt;&gt; there was a generation ago that didn't know anything about this message that started preaching the the truths of the inner place, that secret place, getting lost in God, getting away in God. And they didn't understand and realize that at the at the very same time, there was an adoption and a sunship message that was being preached. And God was tying together all the loose ends of the other church ages in such a beautiful way. and that to to to understand the secret place fully, you would have to understand the the structure that that message was bringing. &gt;&gt; And so you've got you had people running ahead in certain areas &gt;&gt; and missing the whole thing. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And so and so then I know people who came to the message and the first thing they did is they burned everybody else's tapes and they threw everybody else's books away. Somebody ought known right then something wasn't right. &gt;&gt; I I'll just be completely honest with you. Somebody ought said to you, "Maybe you need a doctor." &gt;&gt; Because if that is truth, you can judge all other things by that truth. Right. &gt;&gt; But to think that there's no truth anywhere else and never was &gt;&gt; is a contradiction of that message. &gt;&gt; Because in every church age, &gt;&gt; amen. And so what happened is we came to a greater truth and a higher truth and embraced it and moved forward and and and missed a whole lot of what God was revealing in other places during that time to help us understand the value &gt;&gt; of only you and him &gt;&gt; in the bridal chamber. Had we had we pulled a little of that for forward with us &gt;&gt; and and then took this great truth that changed us and looked back and said my my my with this with Christ the word &gt;&gt; if I go in the secret place with Christ the word this must produce a change. &gt;&gt; Come on. But instead, we had to. Anyway, you know how we had to do. You know how we did. God help us. We're paying the price. We're still here on the earth paying the price. &gt;&gt; When a prophet said 50 plus years ago, the rapture is overdue. If it was overdue 50 years ago, how how overdue do you think it is now? And that's why we have to wade through the manmade doctrines that have been formed by the followers of a message. &gt;&gt; Have nothing to do with the message and they have nothing to do with the word. &gt;&gt; It's someone's version and interpretation. We got to take it right back to the word and become that. Get locked in that place. &gt;&gt; Not coming out. &gt;&gt; I told Benjamin a couple days this week, I'm not answering. I'm not going to take the text. Shut my door. If you're leaving, shut my door. And unless the building is on fire or somebody's dying, I have got to have a few moments with him. &gt;&gt; You'll never be able to help your own family. You'll never be able to help your coworker. You'll never be able to help your church friends and family if you don't take time &gt;&gt; with him. And and I want to tell you something. We think we got to have that thing in our hand all the time. We absolutely do not. &gt;&gt; And and somebody said, "Well, you know what? If somebody needs you, what if there's an emergency?" Let me tell you something. The worst thing that could happen if you needed me in an emergency and I didn't have my phone with me. The worst thing that can happen is you would have to fall on your face &gt;&gt; and pray for yourself. Come on. &gt;&gt; You You see, it wasn't about getting people to a prophet. &gt;&gt; And it's today, it's not about getting people to a pastor. &gt;&gt; It's about coming to Christ &gt;&gt; and making sure there are no dead cats on the line. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't wait until there's no problem in your life to get the line clear. get it all clear right now so that when the problem comes &gt;&gt; and I look I want to it it would worry me to death. It would torment me. It would bother me. It would upset me. I was an hour late answering a text about the baby in the middle of the night and it worried me. I felt guilty. How could I have dozed back off? I had been up. I had been praying. How could I have dozed back off and missed that they were reaching out for me? And I felt terrible. So, I'm not trying to be cold and callous and make you think I won't wouldn't care. I care. &gt;&gt; But I want you to know if he answers. &gt;&gt; I don't need no credit anyhow. &gt;&gt; If he steps up and helps you in that moment, then guess what? You'll be reaching out with a testimony. &gt;&gt; And you'll say, "Pastor, you know, I I I felt bad that I couldn't get you, but I just called on the Lord. &gt;&gt; He came and sat in the automobile with me and helped me. Hallelujah. He will. &gt;&gt; Get a hold of him. &gt;&gt; Woo. He He Central's never busy. He's always on the line. &gt;&gt; You can talk to heaven anytime. Is a a royal service free for one and all. When you get in trouble, give this royal line a call. Telephone to glory. Oh, what joy divine. telephone to go. I can feel the current moving on the line built by God the father for his loved and own. You can talk to Jesus. &gt;&gt; You can talk to heaven on this royal telephone. &gt;&gt; How many of you are thankful for the power of prayer? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This wide shallow is about balance in the fermentation. Don't get off anywhere. Don't get to leaning too heavy on your understanding. &gt;&gt; Lean on revelation and revelation is always rooted in scripture. &gt;&gt; It's very important that we keep our balance in all things. And there's nothing to help us get there like everybody looking at us. &gt;&gt; Get the balance. Keep your emotions intact the best you can. If you're down, you don't want everybody in the world to be down. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. Do you really do you really want to pull somebody else down? If you're down &gt;&gt; and then you're both down. &gt;&gt; How does that feel? &gt;&gt; Not too good. The best marriage you can have is to have one that's up and one that's down and and swap if they have to and finally come to a place where they're always fighting their way up &gt;&gt; and giving God praise in the midst of the trial. &gt;&gt; Don't mean that problems don't come, but it means that we have control over that middle ground. &gt;&gt; We keep pulling it up. I went through something like that this week. Didn't say anything to anybody. I'm sure they knew. I'm I'm sure they did because the one thing I struggle with is the grumps when I'm when I'm fighting that emotions, those emotions of of depression or whatever it is, whatever you would call it. Uh I I tend to be grumpy and I tend to think that people ought to know what I mean instead of what I say. The very thing I preach against, you're not supposed to judge what I mean. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to know what I say, you know. And uh but I want you to know when the victory came, I reported it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I said to my children, I I hadn't said it the words out. I hadn't spoke it out. What I'd gone through, I I'm sure they knew it was something. But when the victory came, I said, I think it was to the girls in the room, I I got it today. I found the place today. And you know how I did it? Behind the door, "Shut the door. Shut the door." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Why in that room? Why over there? Hadn't we been having a glorious uh uh prayer line up here? Why why do we have to go in that little room? And the Lord spoke and said, "When thou doest thine arms, you enter into that secret place &gt;&gt; and close the door." That's what the Lord said. And he understood that that's where the answer's found. &gt;&gt; That's where the change is found. like that old Sunday school superintendent of my granny's when she said that day before she heard the word and stepped down. Let's make sure that we clarify that because that's one of the rumors that's been going around again that I was exonerating a woman preacher. Well, I tell you, she did live a godly life and she should be mentioned with respect and she must have belonged to God &gt;&gt; because when the when the answer came, the truth came, she said, "You mean to tell me it wasn't even my responsibility?" And she stepped down from doing what she had done her whole life to honor the word. &gt;&gt; So, I'm not trying to exonerate her. I'm just telling you stories of my own life. She she said one morning, if you don't have the Holy Ghost, she said, "You don't have no business having some kind of authority or office in anything, particularly the church." &gt;&gt; She said, "Here come the Sunday school superintendent after the service and slammed his record books down on the desk and said, "I quit." And she said, "Why, brother, what in the world has come over you?" He said, "You said that if I didn't have the Holy Ghost, I I didn't have no business hold. I don't know whether I have the Holy Ghost or not. She said, "You don't because she understood that if you do, you know you do." &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible said. &gt;&gt; You'll know you're saved &gt;&gt; by the quickening in your spirit. &gt;&gt; If that's the case, you're definitely going to know when the Holy Ghost abides. &gt;&gt; And if he doesn't, assume the worst and pray. I know that's not how they preach it. That's how I preach it. &gt;&gt; I preach it. Assume the worst and pray till you know. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And they say, "Well, just hold on in faith and and and you know, just keep amen in the word and believe the prophet." Well, since the devil believes, &gt;&gt; not doing him any good, you make sure you've got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; If I'm wrong preaching to you to make sure that you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, I won't mind answering to God for that over there. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm preaching. Make sure you got it. She said, "Why, brother, don't quit. Don't quit. You go make sure you got it." &gt;&gt; And when you do, the books are there. &gt;&gt; She said, "I don't I didn't think I'd see him ever again." Probably because he already was a little off fly off the handle pretty quick. Did he really? Oh, but she said that night we got back to church and we were in pre-ervice prayer and I was down in the altar praying and there were several in the altar praying and she said, "I heard the door slam and I thought, uhoh, what in the world's happening?" She said, "I just I just kept my eyes closed like that." And she said, "I heard somebody walking down the middle aisle of the church with the most purposeful heavy steps I'd heard in a long, long time." And he come up and said, "A hand come on my shoulder and shook me right in the altar praying." I turn around, it was him. He said, "Oh, Sister Shelly, I did what you said." &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; She said, "He didn't have to convince me. I saw it and I could feel it." She said, "His whole countenance changed." &gt;&gt; She said, "I'd never seen him glowing like that." She said, "Well, what happened, brother?" She said, he said, "I took my family home for lunch, dropped them off at the house so that they could have lunch. I said to my wife, "I'm not eating lunch. I'm not eating supper. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I won't be eating breakfast. &gt;&gt; I don't know when I'll eat again. But I'm going to the Pine Thicket and I'm not coming out." &gt;&gt; If you know anything about this message, you'll know that's pretty much how the prophet said it. &gt;&gt; He did the same. Here's me. Here's the cash I have. Here's the money I have. and I you'll see me if I if I come back at all. You know that kind of an attitude. I'm going out there and I'm not coming back until I've heard from him. He said, "I dropped my wife off and my wife was worried and she was saying, "Oh, honey, you got to eat." Blah blah blah. And he said, "I couldn't help it. I wasn't trying to make no show in front of my family, but I found the pine thicket. I parked the car on the side of the road. I went right up in the middle of those pine trees. I saw a log land. I I fell down on my knees and made that an altar. And I prayed and I prayed and I prayed and the first hour I was I was having to get through being mad. &gt;&gt; Then I had to forgive Sister Shelly. &gt;&gt; Then I had to get over the fact that nobody had ever told me till now. Well, that's cuz he acted like he had it. Yeah, you got it. But when you when you were elected to that office, you should have never took the office without knowing. &gt;&gt; But he said, "I prayed through all that, too." And he just said, "I just Lord, I I'm going to I I I'm literally going to just be right here." &gt;&gt; And he said, "I don't even know for sure I mean it the first few times I said it." It sounded like the right thing to say. I've done said it to my family. I might as well say it to the Lord. But he said there was something inside of me. He said, 'Oh, you'll be hungry about supper time. Oh, but he said, I kept to praying until I got to a place where I meant it. And I said, they can find my bones. I don't care. They can find what's left of me, but I'm not leaving here until heaven comes down and glory fills my soul. And he fills me with a walking, talking Holy Ghost. And he's testifying to Granny. She's still in the altar. Turn around, listen to him. And he said he did. Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And she said, "You ought to have seen the revival that broke out. Service that night was like a revival." And somebody said, "Let's come to church tomorrow night." And she said, "That's how it started." Listen, folks, if everybody would get that desperate in this late hour to have the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; that you would lay around somewhere before the Lord until he filled you. I'm telling you, you'd get up and you'd love the one that you're struggling to love. Now, &gt;&gt; you see, we could accept, folks, you can accept someone's apology. It's easy. Sure, we usually say something stupid like, "No problem. There was a problem." and somebody's trying to make it right &gt;&gt; and you know it bothered you and you know it hurt you and you know you suffered because of it so they come to apologize you oh it didn't bother me I'm I'm all right it's okay don't worry about it now do you think that sets up a new do you think that puts everything on a new day and and everybody just goes upward from there no because it's based on a foundation of dishonesty &gt;&gt; it did hurt Why don't you just say, "Well, it really hurt me at the time. I might not have been prayed up enough, but but regardless, I don't know. But it really really hurt me, and I would be over it by now had I just really given it to the Lord. And you would have been over it by now had you made a change in your life, and we'd be moving on. But this is the start. Let's call this the start. And we're not only going to say, "I forgive you because you did bother me. You did hurt me, but I I'm going to forgive you, but now we're going to build from here on out. And and let there be a change in me that I don't hold it anymore. But let there be a change in you." That's a prayer. &gt;&gt; If you start telling them that, they'll ruin. &gt;&gt; But cry out to God. Let there be a change in them. Because if you'll change your life, then that's real repentance. &gt;&gt; If you mope around still and want somebody to feel sorry for you as though you're the victim &gt;&gt; when you're the one who did it, &gt;&gt; you've not had a change. &gt;&gt; That's no change. We've got to if Look, folks, I send folks the other way when someone comes to me with a if I've done anything. If you don't know, it's not a repentance. I I mean, we got to grow up now. Woo! It's quiet. Got to go. Got to hurry. &gt;&gt; We got to grow up. &gt;&gt; You You may not be completely sure, but if is not a good way to lead, &gt;&gt; especially if that person is still raw and you come up saying, "If no, don't do that. I know I must have done something because sometimes you you really know what you did. &gt;&gt; If we would start off honest without hypocrisy in trying to make something work, God would honor that. &gt;&gt; He doesn't honor a lack of integrity. Right? &gt;&gt; He don't honor somebody who goes around behind your back saying, "Well, I I you know, I I owned up to it, but it really wasn't all that much. &gt;&gt; That's not real repentance. You didn't have a real change. You immediately tried to start rebuilding your reputation." And God, I tell you, that stinks in his nostrils. &gt;&gt; It's better to say, "I was wrong." brother uh whoever Lee Veil in the church age book said &gt;&gt; that there's a great need in this hour for screaming out I was wrong. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It you know we could just kind of make that our theme sometime because we're so good at shifting blame in this hour. I I me &gt;&gt; I was wrong. God have mercy on me. I blew it. I'm telling you, God says, "Wow, that's my boy. That's my girl." Because when we can be honest with ourselves, God sees that as an open door to come and mold us. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Well, I'll just tell you what. I'm giving you an out now because one way or the other, we're going to come to that place. And it may be the public gaze vessel. Although I know some folks who spend some time in that public gaze vessel and they came out the same way they went in. And you know what that tells me? &gt;&gt; It tells me another another trip around the mountain. &gt;&gt; I could call names in this house. You've got another trip around the mountain coming. You can to decide today to be real, &gt;&gt; to take off the facade, &gt;&gt; to quit being phony &gt;&gt; and be genuine. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Ghost in you is genuine. &gt;&gt; God is genuine. The word is genuine. &gt;&gt; And when we try to repair what people think about us more than we spend time trying to repent and get it right &gt;&gt; for the right reason, Yes. &gt;&gt; Then we we become a distraction more than we do become something that's going to take us forward. Lord knows I don't want to hinder nobody. &gt;&gt; I don't want to get hindered. And I don't want to hinder nobody else. I'm just trying to be really really real. And if I could keep you out or spare you that part of public gaze, I would because it is not comfortable. And some people with a with a certain kind of mindset work overtime when they're in that vessel to try to go around make sure that everybody's not going to really think the worst. &gt;&gt; And when you do that, you're defeating the whole purpose of being poured in there anyhow. &gt;&gt; Exposure. Listen, the purpose of the vessel of public gaze is exposure. Let us all say exposure. &gt;&gt; Sounds exciting, doesn't it? Exposure. It's like being caught skinny dipping. Did I just say that? I did. There's your blooper. You can't get much more open than that. That's a lot of exposure. More than I want to ever see. I know you feel the same way. So stay out of my backyard. I'm just kidding. Just kidding. Kind of. The wide shallow design ensured uh both even and balanced fermentation. It's also very important that we keep our balance in all things. All right. Purpose of the design exposure. This vessel was open at the top. It was purposely designed to expose the fermenting wine to oxygen and small controlled amounts of light. The vessel of misunderstanding was to give you no light because the first steps of fermentation need to take place in total darkness. The second steps of fermentation in the racking system is controlled amounts of light getting into the into the liquid and oxygen being able to get to it without a cork, without a seal. And that's a good thing, folks, because it means that the vessel uh of public gaze is shorter almost always than the vessel of misunderstanding because the the amount of light and oxygen has to be controlled or the wine will become oxidized and spoiled. If you ever find wine, maybe homemade wine for communion or something. If you if you uh see that it has spoiled, it is most likely because it was exposed to too much light or too much oxygen. If you if you were to jar it and you leave the jar lid off too long and too much oxygen gets to the wine, it's like spores in the air and it gets into that wine and it becomes over oxidized and it spoils. So, it has to be a controlled environment and God gets to pick it. He picks that place of public gaze in your life. You don't pick it. &gt;&gt; He picks it. It's controlled. It's for a purpose. Anybody here? &gt;&gt; This little bit of oxygen further activated the fermentation process, boosting the wine's aroma and color and fragrance. It was not sealed and therefore was not meant for long-term storage. Too much time in this vessel could cause spoilage. The vessel served a brief yet highly intentional season in producing the most valuable and sought-after wine. Its design prioritized observation over pers. Unlike the sealed darkness of the vessel of misunderstanding, this vessel is open for inspection. You can fool anybody that doesn't get a good look. &gt;&gt; This season is about getting a good look. &gt;&gt; You're not going to hide from this one. This is who you are on a Monday. This is who you are. As I said, when your parking place is stolen, this is who you are when you aren't getting customer service like you like you uh deserve and you and you show out. This this is about God revealing first to you through the eyes of others the issues of your own heart. In darkness, you cry out to him, "Show me the issues of my heart." In public gaze, you see them because other people see them and they confront you with them. And that's when we really squirm. Let the saints say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; The vessel, the vessel, serve. All right. Uh this this inspection is a period of being openly tested. I mean, all of us would rather go through a trial in a closet, but that's if we were in a closet, we might not have a trial, but living life out here in the open, uh, you don't always get to duck out when you have a hardship. So, who you really are, let me give you an example, and I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings or or bring up sad events, but coming to church in a camp meeting service on the day of the darkest tragedy that this church has ever experienced and praising God and praying the glory down and worshiping the Lord and exalting God in the midst of the hurt and the pain and the loss and the questions and the misunderstanding. understanding. That's a way to press on. &gt;&gt; That's who you really are. When when you can behave like that in the heat, &gt;&gt; when you can shut out every other thought and every other image, &gt;&gt; and you can glorify God, not because you have nothing to be sorrowful about, but glorify him because he's worthy, because he's never failed you, because he's faithful. &gt;&gt; That's the testimony. That's the real testimony. It's not well-worded responses. It's what you do in the heat of the moment. And that's why God puts us in public gaze. &gt;&gt; That's why you have to answer to these things. And I have everywhere I've gone. First question I've been asked by people I barely know is about that particular moment of tragedy. And I use it every time as an example to say that in the hardest moment, God's people, if they hold on to him, they rise to the top like cream. &gt;&gt; And in that, God is glorified, not them. &gt;&gt; Cuz they're still the flawed people they were before. &gt;&gt; But but the cream comes to the top and with it, God is exalted and glorified. And if God, you're going to, I'm telling you, you're going to come to the place where you really, more than anything else, some of you may not get there till after 50, but I hope I hope you come quickly. You're going to realize the value of God getting glory for his name in everything. And it changes the way when you get a good good revelation of that. It changes the way you respond because you want to respond in a way you want to behave in a way that he will ultimately &gt;&gt; be glorified. &gt;&gt; Can anybody understand that? Got to hurry. Got to hurry. &gt;&gt; Yes. There's a spiritual parallel in all this. This vessel symbolizes seasons of visibility where God allows your life to be seen, to be tested, to be refined before others. Unlike the darkness of the vessel of misunderstanding, here you are in open. You are in the open under observation. You weren't meant to stay in that vessel long, just long enough for God to watch, to get a good look at what's bubbling in you. Because the wine maker controls the amount of time that's spent in the vessel of public gaze by the bubbles. Not enough bubbles, more time. Too many bubbles, enough time, dumping into something else. Does that make any sense? So be careful how you bubble. &gt;&gt; Not just your neighbors watching, God's watching how you bubble. Lord, let me bubble right. Hallelujah. Let me bubble right. So the characteristics of this season quickly, a season where you are seen but not necessarily celebrated, observed but not always understood. Your life is lived in the open and your responses are on display. Now try to talk me out of my observation. It's going to be hard to do. So that need to defend. &gt;&gt; We've already seen that you how awful you acted because you're a grown person and you didn't get your way. So, at that point, I may not be willing and your friends may not be willing to hear all the excuses because we've already seen how you behaved. And God didn't ordain you to behave that way. But God ordained for us to see it, to hold you accountable. And that's a tough lesson, folks. I'm not going to have no shouting down the aisles. I better hush. I better just close on this one. But the reality is that is for a reason. And and not only is God going to hold you responsible to correct the way you behave that got you in that mess, &gt;&gt; but God's going to hold those closest to you responsible &gt;&gt; for not holding you to accountability. &gt;&gt; It's all right for you to say, "Now, honey, you ought not to have responded that way." &gt;&gt; Just a minute. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, pastor. earn your paycheck. &gt;&gt; We don't want no freeloading preacher around here. We want you to work for your money. &gt;&gt; Well, here I'm working. &gt;&gt; It's all right to say, "My sweet husband." Somebody said, "You're going to cause riots in here." No, no, no. It just may be a opportunity for a Zapora. There is a time. And listen, that's why marriage has to be that way. &gt;&gt; That 50/50 junk is a new age lie. &gt;&gt; It's a fraud. Marriage is not 50/50. And if that's how you entered marriage, no wonder it's been so bumpy. &gt;&gt; Marriage is 100% and 100%. &gt;&gt; And if you don't do that, and then without God's 100%, you're in trouble anyway. &gt;&gt; It's a three-fold cord that's not easily broken. The scripture said it's got to be all of you and all of him. All of him and all of her and all of him &gt;&gt; to make it work. And and and I would if I were a woman, if I were the weaker vessel in a marriage, I would be careful how I chose that moment. And it's only a woman who has certainly built up her husband in life that will have an effective voice in a time like that. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because the one thing that a man looks for in a relationship, and people really don't like this, but it's well documented and well proven, is honor. &gt;&gt; Oh, what? Because he's the king? No, because he's the one bearing the responsibility. &gt;&gt; And that becomes very hard when you're not living with an honorable man. It becomes very hard when you didn't live in a home where the husband, the man was honored, the husband was honored. I don't mean worshiped. &gt;&gt; I mean respected for the job he does. &gt;&gt; I mean told on occasion, thank you for making a good living. Thank you for working hard for the family. &gt;&gt; And that's not a man who does nothing else but work at on the job, come home and do nothing. He has responsibility particularly in helping mold the character of his children. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you, if you'll tell that man, "I appreciate you. I love you. I honor you. I I I I'm with you. I hear you. I will put my phone down &gt;&gt; and hear what you have to say." And then you brothers, you have to do the same. I will put my phone down. &gt;&gt; I'll turn off the idiot box if we've got it owned. &gt;&gt; And I will hear what you have to say. If you're not married to her, then you don't have you have no right or responsibility anyway to demand anything of anybody &gt;&gt; because God doesn't honor that. So, uh, if you're if you're in a in a dating situation or courtship situation where somebody's trying to control somebody, that's not God's best. &gt;&gt; It's a give and a take. When God has said, "Okay, I've honored this. I'm going to honor this." Then it becomes a give and a take. If you let a man feel that he's respected and honored and cherished, I'm telling you, he's in a better condition to help you with where you have your need. And a woman has to be loved. She doesn't have to just be told she's loved. She has to be loved. &gt;&gt; She Here's a part I have struggled with in my life and marriage. She has to be loved in a way that says to her, strange creature that she is, I'm loved. I like to say my love language is picking on people. My wife likes to say, "It's not mine." Don't be like the idiot who says to his wife, "I told you I love you on my wedding day. If I ever change my mind, I'll let you know." &gt;&gt; That won't work. And it's not as much about the telling &gt;&gt; as it is the showing. &gt;&gt; It's a feeling to her. It's a feeling to her. It's a feeling of security and warmth and some cherishing. Of course, if you build that kind now, if you will work toward that, you also then have the privilege of saying at the right time in the right attitude in the right way and and and if it's a especially a wife to her husband, you know, you don't want to come across being religious or you just want to be humble about it. But Zapora, you know, she didn't know a lot about TAC. She wasn't uh originally Israeli and she wasn't quite up on all the Hebrew um culture. And so she just said, "You've been a bloody husband to me, Moshe." She she must have been a dark-kinned person, but from Australia, because they like to use the word bloody a lot, don't they? She said, "You've been a bloody husband to me, Moses." What could he say? He hadn't obeyed God. And the men were suffering because the leader had not obeyed God. and she had to hold him to accountability. And I don't know if it stepped on his ego or broke his pride or what it did, but I want to tell you something. He didn't have the worst pain coming. &gt;&gt; The worst pain was coming to all those Hebrew men out there that now had to be circumcised as adults. &gt;&gt; Because Moses had stepped away from his spiritual duty. &gt;&gt; A relationship is about accountability. A pushy woman, it's not going to work. An overbearing husband, it's not really going to build that kind of an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; So, there's a whole lot of gazing going on at home sometime. when you see the best, when you see the worst. And God lets us see the worst and feel the worst and hear the worst about our own selves sometime because he wants us to go off and lay it before him. &gt;&gt; It's all right, brother. It's all right, sister, to say to the Lord, "If I could have changed it in my own power, I already would have. Now I'm coming to you." Yes, &gt;&gt; that's the El Shadai blessing. &gt;&gt; That he will do for you. &gt;&gt; What you can't do for yourself. &gt;&gt; What you cannot Hallelujah. Woo. What you can't do, what I can't do for myself, &gt;&gt; he can do for me. &gt;&gt; But I got to be honest with him. Why do I have to be honest with him? He knows anyway. &gt;&gt; Because the honesty is not for him. &gt;&gt; It's for you. It's getting your mouth around the words, "I was wrong." &gt;&gt; It's powerful. &gt;&gt; It's powerful. It's not too late. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're nearly done for Sunday. Praise God. This is a season of public testing. Heaven observes. The church takes note. And the enemy lies in weight &gt;&gt; and you've got to endure it. &gt;&gt; It's a season where you are visible, tested, watched, sometimes opposed, and expected at all times to represent God. It's hard. It's not easy. &gt;&gt; Others see your flaws and God confronts your image. This is not to humiliate you. It is all about refinement. This is a stage where exposure refineses. Here, God doesn't just work through misunderstanding. He uses truth under pressure. Oh, you didn't hear me. &gt;&gt; The first vessel was misunderstanding. Now he's operating with truth under pressure. &gt;&gt; The the the hardest truth is truth under pressure to reveal deeper need in us for integrity. It has to be about discipline and accountability. When it's his bride &gt;&gt; that's being refined. He's not courting a church. &gt;&gt; He's building a bride. &gt;&gt; He's building a wife. &gt;&gt; In order in order to be his wife, you're going to have to have his character. &gt;&gt; And that don't take place if you're like Moab and you've never been poured from vessel to vessel. You're just a little squeaky Christian sitting on the pew living a double triple life. But when God starts putting the pressure on and you have to be real with yourself. Honesty starts with yourself and with God. The public gaze tests the durability of private devotion. &gt;&gt; You said you were going to pray, did you? You said you were going to pray for her. Did you pray for her? &gt;&gt; Pressure to represent God faithfully. Your character is your witness. The smallest reaction can glorify Christ or bring reproach. We all ought to know that by the volleyball uh you know trials of the last it's been a while but you know several years grown men with babies. God turns the light on us. &gt;&gt; It's humiliating. But the reality is it's so that you can say to him, "Oh, I thought I had that under control. It didn't matter. Oh, it didn't matter. You acted like all that and it didn't matter. You nearly cussed and it didn't matter. &gt;&gt; You acted like a three-year-old. I'm going to take my marbles and go home." And it didn't matter. It did matter. And God was testing what was in your heart. And it had to come to the surface, not so that others would be able to judge you, but so that you would find some accountability in your exposure and go home and lay it before the Lord. But here's what people do. They go home and justify it to their families. They go home and make excuses for the way they behaved. That didn't do us any good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Get in there behind that veil &gt;&gt; and let the fire of God's shakana glory burn out &gt;&gt; the humanity that has left. &gt;&gt; Musicians are easing this way. &gt;&gt; Your character is your witness. &gt;&gt; Not not your language. Not not your hallelujah and praise the Lords and the prophet dids &gt;&gt; and saids. It's your character. It's the way you live. That's your witness. &gt;&gt; God's not just dealing with others perceptions. &gt;&gt; He's showing you your own blind spots. &gt;&gt; Everybody has a blind spot. &gt;&gt; Everybody has a tender place. &gt;&gt; This isn't a This isn't demotion. What I'm preaching about today is not about demotion. It's a crucible. &gt;&gt; And we need a crucible. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we need sometime more than one. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, I got to know what a crucible is." Well, a crucible is a container used to heat metal to burn off impurities. &gt;&gt; And so, the word has come to mean by definition a transformative experience through which an individual comes to a new sense of identity. &gt;&gt; Oh, God, send the crucible. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; When we need it, send it. &gt;&gt; Because we need a new identification, one that's found in you and not in our old coping mechanisms. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We spend too much time, brothers and sisters, taking ourselves out of the accountability. And we need to spend a little more time putting ourselves in. There was a capstone in one of those experiences and it come flying over the hill. &gt;&gt; It hovered above gently above the top of the of the pyramid-shaped mountain of Zion, which is the throne of God. It's not only the the city of Zion. It's the mountain of the Lord. It's the throne of God. It's the judgment seat for the rest of the world at some point. They don't come any higher. God said, "Set a boundary around the base of the mountain." &gt;&gt; That Old Testament that people complain about us preaching from it so often using it as example. You're going to find out one day that the principles that God lined out for us in that old covenant, &gt;&gt; it really is the definition of our eternity. &gt;&gt; Because even in eternity, we will see those realities and truths displayed before our very eyes. Who will ascend the hill of the Lord? There's a church out there that'll never get past the border &gt;&gt; at the base of the mountain. &gt;&gt; Some will have eternal life because they called on the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Some will have eternal life because they called on and died first first group because they called on the name of Jesus Christ and went by the grave. And there'll be more who will call on the name of Jesus Christ and then give their lives &gt;&gt; in the great tribulation period, the last three and a half years of of Daniel's troubles, and they'll find theirelves with eternal life. Whosoever call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. I just love to hear uh uh message people trying to say that no one is saved outside the message. You are narrowminded &gt;&gt; and you don't have the same experience that others have found &gt;&gt; in the word because you can't change the Bible &gt;&gt; to try to make it fit your favorite quote. &gt;&gt; But there are boundaries around Mount Si. Yes. &gt;&gt; And their boundaries around Mount Zion because the Sinai of the old is the Zion of the new. &gt;&gt; The Gibian, the order of Gibian will not work. What what happened in the tabernacle in the wilderness in Gibian will not operate in the tabernacle of David on Mount Zion. It's a different experience altogether. But the same holy is there. &gt;&gt; That's right. In fact, the holy has been put back because in that tabernacle, they continued to worship and offer blood and do all the things that God told Moses to do in Exodus 25. But they knew good and well that the ark wasn't there because they had marched out like a bunch of religious zealots into a battlefield when God never told them to take the holy out there into the battlefield. He said, "You take your praise &gt;&gt; and you scream, let God arise, but you don't have to lift the box. &gt;&gt; You just scream, let God arise, and he'll come." But they said, "Hey, this is like a good luck charm." &gt;&gt; Like a crucifix &gt;&gt; or a belt buckle or I got one of the pyramid rocks. So do I. But it ain't no good luck charm. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I said, "I called them up here to help you, not to help me. I'm not done yet." God said, "I I I" and there they just kept doing it, kept doing it, kept doing it. But the ark was no longer there because here they marched it out and it was captured away by the Philistines. But they kept doing kept doing the same thing. Three songs, &gt;&gt; 30 minutes of a tape, little comment from the preacher so he can earn his you know a little song at the end. Lights off way before nine. Let's get out of here. Somebody's got to pay the bills. Doing the rituals, but no holy. &gt;&gt; The holy was gone. But they just kept doing it, hoping people would forget their silly mistake. David said, "No way will we get that thing back. We're going to put it up there on the on the on Zion." Woo! &gt;&gt; And we're going to put it there without a veil. &gt;&gt; And people are going to come from all over this land and worship God before the ark of the covenant. &gt;&gt; And they're going to see with their own eyes that it's there because the new order, it's not about secrecy, &gt;&gt; not in the congregation. in the heart. It's about exposure. &gt;&gt; Show people what is holy. &gt;&gt; Now, all of that's Old Testament, but it's setting an order. &gt;&gt; Hear that uh capstone? It's hovering over there. And and you think, "Oh my, this is the moment. The moment we've waited on, it's going to sit down on top. That perfect love is going to sit down on top of that uh uh pyramid." And some of you don't know what we're talking about. I'm sorry. Some of you do. It's going to sit there like that. And all of a sudden, that black gloved hand said no. Not now. It must have been thinking, you know, and and shoved it away. And it comes down, you know, to find it. It's it's the cornerstone &gt;&gt; that the builders have rejected. And I don't know if you know this or not, but the capstone of a pyramid was not what sat on top. It was the foundation stone that was in the bottom. &gt;&gt; Sorry. And so if one don't have it on the top, the next thing you need to figure out is does it have it down here? Because that's where the spot was left for it. You've got to remember that these pyramids were were originally designed not excuse me, they were originally designed to be something precious, but they were hijacked for something pagan &gt;&gt; for a long time. They represent a lot to us. But we're not pyramidologists. We don't we don't study pyramidology. We don't embrace Israel British Israelism, which is a pyramidology doctrine. We don't we don't embrace that. But God speaks out of that mountain because it represents the virtues of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And here I'm thinking that that stone is about to find its place wherever here or there. And it comes flying over the hill. And what does it do? It strikes the forehead because sitting up there as an ornament is not going to be the answer for the bride. &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual thing we're talking about now. But if that love if you can if you can line yourself up and and all that's in that headstone capstone, if that strikes you, &gt;&gt; why here? because that represents not just the intellect. It really represents the fullness of who you are is represented here because you've either got the mind of of an unregenerated sinner or you've got the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; So that's helping make sure that you've got the mind of Christ. It's bringing head knowledge to heart knowledge. &gt;&gt; And there's something you need to remember. both mount Zion and the headstone was alive. &gt;&gt; So, it's bringing that life inside of the believer. &gt;&gt; And then what we're left to do is deal with the stuff that's got to get pushed out so that we can surrender to perfect love. Because I'm telling you, he said, "Without perfect love, without perfect love, without perfect love, we can toot our horns and think we've got it, but it's not going to be uh uh something you can fudge on. &gt;&gt; We're going to have to produce it. It's growth sometimes through criticism. God is trying to bring us to a place where it's authenticity over performance. Amen. &gt;&gt; It burns away performative righteousness, forcing you into the true identity in Christ. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to close with this. I I I'm going to I'm going to get this just a piece of this. In Psalm 26:2, the psalmist said, "Examine me, O Lord, and prove me. Try my reigns and my heart. The Amplified said, "Examine me, O Lord, and prove me." Do you really want to pray that prayer? Because if you do, he's going to hear you. And what we really want is for him to whisper in our ear what we need to work on. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be lovely? you just come real real quietly and tell me what I need to do different and I'm going to work on it now. Jesus, but that's not the prayer that this psalmist was praying. He was literally, if you look at the original words, he was saying, "Expose me. Rip off the sh the charade, the facade. dig to the deepest part of who I am and let me see my own heart and let me see my own emotions and let me see my own response so that I can throw it before you and be new. The Amplified said, "Examine me, oh Lord, and prove me and test my heart and test my mind and see who I am." And that can't always come with a whisper. It sometimes has to come through public gaze. And nobody wants to hear such a thing. And I want to I want to give you this experience in closing. I feel like that I would not have finished without this. Are you musicians listening too? Thank you for sitting up there. Many years ago, the Lord spoke to my life in an ordinary moment. We were enjoying a beautiful time at the beach in Fort Morgan with brother and sister West. We were going to leave there and go to a conference that was being held in in lower Alabama and they had arranged a a beach house. And if you know anything about Fort Morgan, it's away from the hustle and the bustle of Gulf Shores and Orange Beach. It's way out there. We saw things that we'd never seen before. Little baby seahorses and bigger shells. And it was just a wonderful, wonderful week. and we were having a great time and the baby who was Mariah at the time was asleep and she's she's turning 19 this week and then Benjamin's birthday and he he's he's a lot more than 19. She was the baby and she was asleep and I'd volunteered a couple days in a row to sit with the baby to stay with the baby while she took her nap. We could walk to the beach and Stacy could go after feeding her could go back down to the beach and I tiptoed into the bathroom like we do when we have small children. Everything is is is has to be quieter seems. And uh she was asleep in the play pen in the bedroom. And I walked into the little washroom that was attached and I washed my face and hands because everybody knows that sticky feeling you get from the winds at the beach, the sticky and the sand and ocean water and all that stuff. And I thought about taking a shower. Then I thought, "No, because she might wake up and she would cry and be scared. And I'll just wash my hands and my face and I think that'll make me feel better." And I and there's a towel hanging there. And I just I'm telling you that I wasn't praying. I wasn't humming. I wasn't singing. I wasn't meditating on the Lord. Wasn't reading the Bible. Just drying my hands. And I heard a voice and and my first thought was uh I got to tell brother West to hold it down because he's come back and he's going to wake up the baby. And I actually started to make a make a move and and I heard the voice clearly that time. I will give you a sign and I will make you a gazing stock. And I those words cut deep and my first reaction was no Lord not that I certainly had not been praying or asking for any kind of promotion. The very thought of becoming a spectacle exposed, inspected, even ridiculed was more than unsettling. And he repeated the strange sentence to me again. In my spirit, I don't have to sit here and try to explain to you how to hear the voice of God. &gt;&gt; If you've ever heard it, you know it. And you'll know it the next time. &gt;&gt; How do I know it's not me? It's not your voice. It's not your thought. It comes from another dimension, from another place. And if it sounds like you, it's probably you. But if it sounds like something you wouldn't be thinking or saying, it can often be the Lord. And I knew this was him because I don't generally use the word gazing stock, first of all. And I sure wasn't asking for a sign. He repeated it again. I will give you a sign and I'll make you a gazing stock. But this time it was more forceful. And I said out loud, "Oh Lord, no." And then I remembered Mariah. I cannot say at the moment that I even fully began to process the unpacking or the digesting of what that meant. But I knew it did not sound like fun. And I knew that when I mentioned it to Stacy later, she didn't seem too thrilled with the presumed implications of her husband being a gazing stock. And yet the very next night, the Lord took me to a scripture and he said, "Here it is." I'd say a 7-Eleven. Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God. Ask it either in the depth or in the height above. The problem is I hadn't asked for a sign and I wasn't planning on asking for a sign. In the amplified it said, "Ask for yourself a sign, a token, a proof of the Lord your God, one that will convince you that God has spoken and will keep his word." &gt;&gt; Ask it either in the depth below or in the height above. Let it be as deep as shol or as high as heaven. But ask. I told the Lord that if this was some message about scrutiny and more criticism that I had already been a magnet for both my entire life and ministry. I really wasn't interested in more. And he gave me a scripture again. Hebrews 10 32-33. I'm going to do it amplified for time. But be ever mindful of the days gone by in which after you were first spiritually enlightened, you endured a great and painful struggle. We have those verses if someone could put them up. Be ever mindful. I'll wait. I realize your uh understanding is probably expired here, but I'm not leaving until I get this out. I have to live with me between now and Tuesday. But be ever mindful of the days gone by in which after you were first spiritually enlightened, you endured a great and painful struggle. Sometimes being yourselves a gazing stock, publicly exposed to insults and abuse and distress and sometimes claiming fellowship and making common cause with others who were so treated. What God is speaking through his apostle to say that when you when you become a gazing stock and everyone's looking at you and scrutinizing you, there's a purpose in that. &gt;&gt; It's so that you can understand what other people go through in their season of being overly scrutinized. And God said, "I'll get glory in that &gt;&gt; if you're willing to let me put you in a place that's going to cause every eye to be on you a time or two. If you'll let me do that, I will work a work in you like I have in others." Well, I'm in then. If if if you'll do in me what you've done in others, if if you'll bring me to a higher place &gt;&gt; of obedience and surrender &gt;&gt; like you have others, I'm in. Lord, I want to change my answer from no to yes. &gt;&gt; A gazing stock is a person or thing that is gazed at by many, especially with curiosity or contempt. Have you ever said about somebody they either love you or hate you? They either love him or hate him. You ever said that about anybody? How many of you ever said about me? Don't raise your hand. Many people have said it to me. Brother Shel, there about you. People either love you or they hate you. There's not a lot of in between. That's part of the word. I didn't ask for this identity. I was just drying my hands, folks. But anything that God does for a leader, it's to send a message. Not that I got a special guy here. It's you're going to need to know this lesson. You're going to need to see it because he's not the only one that's going to be a gazing stock. &gt;&gt; The pressure comes on all of us &gt;&gt; because God's getting something out of us so that he can get something in us. &gt;&gt; That sound good, anybody? And in closing, just let me say in Hebrew, the word is the same word in in uh that, excuse me, in in Greek, I put Hebrew because in Hebrews, what I just read in Hebrews, the word is a Greek word, and it's the word where we get the English word theater. And it's it means to bring upon the theater to be made a spectacle of to be made a gazing stock both by reproaches and afflictions. Now, who's in? I didn't think there'd be a lot of volunteers. &gt;&gt; Well, here I need to close by telling you, you don't really get to decide. &gt;&gt; God gave me an invitation, but he'd already put me there. &gt;&gt; He just was telling me what he'd already done. I'm going to bring some scrutiny in your life. I'm going to let you behave good and you're also going to behave bad. What's in you is going to come out and somebody's going to see it and they're going to know it and going to be judged for it. But the reason is it's going to drive you to the secret place. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Oh, it does. &gt;&gt; It drives me to the secret place. There's somebody in the church this morning who said just recently, "I don't understand it. I don't understand all the criticism. I don't understand it." I just listened to a tape where the preacher, Brother Shel, was preaching in 1995, and he's preaching the same thing in 1995 that he's preaching in 2025. &gt;&gt; So, the one thing you can't say is, "I didn't change my mind along the way. I've understood from the beginning that balance it's what brings us to truth &gt;&gt; and it's it's what keeps us in truth because it's so easy to lean to the right or the left. Now I'm waiting on that. I want that. I want that full experience &gt;&gt; of that headstone. How does it come? Not with criticism. It's from him. And what how does it come with shouts of what? &gt;&gt; How many of you are in now? Amen. &gt;&gt; You can get through it with grace. Let's stand. &gt;&gt; Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that say [Music] like me. Oh, I once was lost. Oh, but now I'm found. He's going to get you through it. &gt;&gt; You got his life on the inside. He's going to get you through it. was grace that taught my heart to fear. And it was grace my fears relieved. Oh, how precious [Music] that grace [Music] appear the hour. &gt;&gt; Why don't you worship God with us for a minute? Grace is going to get you through the scrutiny when it comes to grace. that verse again that taught my heart to fear and it was grace my fears relieved. Oh, how precious. Just in time. Just in time that grace appeared. Ver. [Music] &gt;&gt; If you're worried about getting through this vessel of public gaze, think about how you come through all the others through many, many dangerous toils. Toils and snares. I have I have already already come. &gt;&gt; And what got you through was grace. &gt;&gt; Do you really mean that? &gt;&gt; Do you recognize her? &gt;&gt; Mrs. Grace will be. &gt;&gt; You got a heavenly home. Sing about it with me. When we been there [Music] 10,000. All right. [Music] the sun. Oh, we've no less days to see God's praise. Then when we first began, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. Oh, and praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Tell the Lord, I'm going all the way. I'm going to go all the way. Praise God. Praise God. Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Thank you, Jesus. Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. God. Praise God. He became sin who knew no sin that we might become his righteousness. He humbled himself and carried the cross. Love so amazing. [Music] Oh love so amazing. [Music] Jesus Messiah, [Music] the name above all names. [Music] Oh blessed redeemer, [Music] you are Emmanuel, [Music] the rescue for sinners, [Music] the ransom from heaven. [Music] Oh Jesus Messiah. [Music] Oh the Lord of all. His body the bread. His blood the wine over broken and poured out. All for love. The whole earth trembled and the veil was torn. Love so amazing. Love so amazing. Jesus Messiah, [Music] the name above all names. Oh, blessed redeemer. You are Emmanuel, [Music] the rescue for sin. [Music] the ransom from heaven. [Music] Oh Jesus, Messiah, you are the Lord of all. And all our hope is in you. And all our hope is in you. All the glory gloryy to God. Oh the light of the world and all our hope is in you. It's in you. All our hope is in you. &gt;&gt; It's in you, Jesus. and all the gloryy [Music] to you, God, light of the world. The light of the world. I want you to just wait before the Lord for just a moment. Uh if you're here and you recognize that you have waited through misunderstanding and and uh public gaze in in your life and maybe at the time you didn't see that it was God allowing you to learn some lessons. and come up to higher places to feel the fellowship of what other saints of likeminded faith have to go through to get to that place to be ultimately used. The goal is a body ministry. &gt;&gt; It's not a one-man thing. It's a body ministry. And you're going to have to be able to minister to all the needs of a body. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother to brother, sister to sister, spirit to spirit, fellowship and healing and wholeness. And and had it not been for these things, you you wouldn't know what it feels like. Now, I I know that doesn't make us run to get in line to get more of that kind of stuff. But here's what we have to do. We have to make sure that we learn the lesson. &gt;&gt; And if you're here today and you say, "I I've heard this and and and I'm walking through some of that. I've been walking through it. It's not not new to me today, but I want to make sure that I am humbling my heart before the Lord and that I've truly learned &gt;&gt; because I want to be used in body ministry. I want to be able to pray sister to sister, brother to brother. I want to be able to help people when they go through these trials. And I feel ill equipped to do it because I'm not sure that I picked up all I needed to pick up through that through that hour. But I want to be wine. &gt;&gt; Yes. in the king's cup. If you're here like that, would you just join the rest of us around the altar? If that's you, if you feel any identification to that, I realize some people can't really identify, but if you can, we're not going to shove you or push on your sign you up or anything like that, but we're just going to pray. And we want to pray for people who are willing to receive what the Lord has. And sometime we're just not willing, we're not ready, we're not in that place yet to learn the maximum to get the benefit. And you know, if you got to go through it anyhow in life, you might as well get the maximum benefit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Get this thing wonder done. Let's get it done. &gt;&gt; Get the victory and and move on &gt;&gt; to the next thing because I want the leaves left behind. I want the dregs left behind. And I've got to be like him so that he can fully occupy. &gt;&gt; You want to be fully occupied by the character and life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's more than that's more than churchity there. &gt;&gt; That's sunship in full adoption. &gt;&gt; And I believe you. I believe you. Before I even before I even looked to see who was here, I knew that there would be a number of you here because you've demonstrated already in your life that you want to go the long way, the long haul. You didn't get in here to quit. You got in here to finish the race. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something. You've showed a tremendous amount of perseverance and dexterity to stand where you're standing today. May God honor your faith. May he honor your faithfulness. And may God bring you to a place where he can minister to you and then through you &gt;&gt; because the bride has a work to do before we get out of here. &gt;&gt; So just if you'll just raise your hand sort of as a surrender to the Lord this time. Here I am and I want maximum effectiveness &gt;&gt; in coming through these things. So let's just pray together, not just one. Father, here we stand around this altar. This is cream rising to the top this morning as people all over this room, even from their seat are willing to say, Lord, I surrender. I I don't like everything that happens. I I don't enjoy everything that happens, but I know with you holding my hand, with you holding my hand, with me holding on to you, &gt;&gt; Lord, I'll get through it. And I want to give you glory. I want to glory even in my trial, even in my persecution, even in my test. I want glory to come to your name. &gt;&gt; This is perhaps not the path I would have chosen to get there, but you knew me better than I knew myself. And so Lord, I just ask right now that my attitude be right before you. &gt;&gt; Would you agree with me in prayer that way? I'd like my attitude just to be right before you. I want to have the right spirit towards you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't want any resentment to grow in my heart because of what I have had to walk through. I want to embrace you and love you and adore you without any blame, without any resentment. Would you would you come right down to the root of where that kind of thing uh likes to hang &gt;&gt; and let your word and by your spirit uproot that today in the name of Jesus Christ that that there'd be no resentment for the trials of the past, no resentment for the circumstances that I've walked through. Would you uproot that now by by your precious authority? Would you uproot that right out of my life right now for the glory of God? Somebody said it couldn't be that simple. It has to be that simple. It's as simple as identifying that there's a need &gt;&gt; and then giving it to God. &gt;&gt; Lord, I have a need. I don't want that growing in me because what grows will eventually bloom and what blooms spreads. It's from the blooming of the flower that the seed are distributed. I don't want to distribute any seed to anyone else because of what I've had to go through. I want to be able to offer help and assistance and I want it to be preemptive. I don't want them to have to go through. It's our desire, Lord, that enough of us have been through enough different things in life that we could help one another and that we wouldn't all have to go through the exact same kind of a trial. The purpose is to get from the bottom of that mountain to the top. The purpose is to have the virtues of Christ born in everyone's heart. One by one, they come. It's a birth. They don't come at the same time like we would prefer. But one by one, the characters of Jesus Christ, all the attributes of his character are birthed and formed in us. It changes us then from glory to glory. And here we are with what we don't understand. We surrender. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; With what we don't identify or recognize in our life, we surrender. We just say, "Lord, if that's who I am, train me, mold me, teach me." Lord, may we not be the offender. You said, "It's better that a millstone were tied about your neck and you were cast in the depths of the sea than to be a hindrance to one of my little ones." Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, in all my struggles, in all my trials, and all my victories, I don't want to be I do not want to be a a a stumbling block, and I don't want to be a millstone around somebody else's neck. So, Lord, I ask that I would not be the offender, that you would teach me how to live a life to hold to accountability without being the offender. Lord, teach us everyone the language of love. And may we learn how to build relationships before we can speak accountability into somebody's life. Help us to form strong bonds and build bigger families. I pray, Lord, that you'll put us so tight together, as brother Bram said, that that even a razor blade couldn't come in between these stones. These are lively stones. These are living stones. And may they be stacked one upon another, laying a great foundation and building the house of the Lord. And may nothing be able to get between us. May we be so perfectly cut and formed and shaped that we can be laid upon one another without the sound of a hammer and build the habitation of the holy God &gt;&gt; in a world that's in real trouble. And Lord, it is not your will that we follow the ways of the world. It's your way will that we follow the ways of Christ. &gt;&gt; Deliver us from the path of popular opinion and peer pressure and may we surrender to the fullness of your word. Now, if you're having a particular problem with something like that, let the Lord touch you just now. And and I know this don't sound good, but I got to tell you anyway. Try so hard not to defend try so hard not to defend yourself and be careful how you defend others. We should stand up for one another, but be careful how you do it &gt;&gt; because if you defend someone else in the wrong way, you add strength to the spirit they are they're under. If indeed they are. And that's not accountability. &gt;&gt; That's enabling. Lord, I don't want to enable anybody to stay where they are. I want to provoke everybody to come higher. Why don't we ask the Lord to help us? Lord, help us right now to be provokers. Not not offenders, but provokers. &gt;&gt; May May there be something seen and heard in us, demonstrated, displayed in us &gt;&gt; that would cause others to want to climb a little higher. &gt;&gt; And may we find ourselves busy laying before you in the secret place. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. so that we don't have time to judge the motives of anybody else. We're on a journey. Lord, may we get up every morning singing, "I'm coming up the rough side of the mountain, but I'm coming up. I'm coming up. I'm coming up because I know where you are." &gt;&gt; And you said when we could not climb any longer. And even after breathing the fire, we would only get a maybe almost to the top, you said that you would bear us to the top on the wings of white eagle. That's a sweep of your spirit. Brother Bam said, "A sweep of your spirit will take us right there." Father, if we can just endure to that moment, I feel strength. I don't know if you're able to feel it or not. It's not by feeling, but I feel strength here. And and it's a supernatural thing. It's not not a physical strength. I need some of that. Don't you? &gt;&gt; But it's something on the inside strengthening the inner man that God wants to impart to us right now. And and I kind of hear I'm hearing something that that's that's just provoking us to run on to run on to run on to not be weary. In fact, I hear him now saying, "Be not weary." &gt;&gt; As the scripture saith, be not weary in welloing. Lord, &gt;&gt; run on. Run on. Run on for you'll reap in due season if you faint not. And so Lord, let our determination uh click in us. &gt;&gt; And when we open our eyes and we start looking around, may we see a light, may we see a brightness, may we see something changing in one another. If we could just see uh there's some who feel like they're just not getting anything. And maybe they could just catch a glimpse of your glory on somebody else. It it would just bring a a surrender to say, "Lord, I want that glory to be seen in me. I want that glory to change me. I tell you, I I can see I can see what God's doing, and I want to honor him for it." &gt;&gt; Sing that, Benjamin, as we just worship another moment before we go. This is the time when trueers will worship him. &gt;&gt; Do what you were born to do. Worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, these are the days when my father's &gt;&gt; my father's ways will be known to me. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, this is our desire. This is the hour where the spirit's power will move again across this land as we worship him in spirit. And &gt;&gt; maybe you just maybe just slip to somebody next to you. May maybe sing it with them. Maybe just join with them in a in a in a way. Maybe stand close or touch him on the shoulder. &gt;&gt; This is a body thing. We got to do this together. We got to go together. &gt;&gt; We got to climb together. &gt;&gt; Get up there. Will you hear yourself? &gt;&gt; These are the days when my father's way will be home to me. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. And this is the hour when the spirit's power will move again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Across this land as we worship him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. And this is the time when you're standing here [Music] will worship him. And these are the days when my father's ways will be known to men. And this is the hour when the spirit's power it will move again. Oh, cross this land as we worship him in spirit and in truth. [Music] And this is the time when trueers [Music] will worship him. And these are the days when my father's ways will be known to me. [Music] And this is the hour when the spirit's power will move again across this land. Oh, as we worship him in spirit and in truth. And this is the time when trueers [Music] will worship him. [Music] &gt;&gt; And these are the days when my father's ways will be known to me. And this is the hour when the spirit's power will move again across this land as we worship him in spirit and in truth. In your presence, that's where I belong. When I walked away, I heard you say in your pray for a reason. She must know. She must God. &gt;&gt; You have to in your pray that it has opened for a reason &gt;&gt; and that God is going to get strong for his name. Seeking I saw beauty for ashes &gt;&gt; trusting your glory. &gt;&gt; I saw silver &gt;&gt; for redemption &gt;&gt; in the cleft of the rock. &gt;&gt; What has been lost? &gt;&gt; Give her strength to get above every bit of it &gt;&gt; in your presence. Let deliverance &gt;&gt; break forth in her inner being &gt;&gt; in your push out &gt;&gt; pushing away all the wound &gt;&gt; that's all the hurt in your presence &gt;&gt; may the pattern be broken the cycle be broken &gt;&gt; oh Lord the repeated cycle be in your presence &gt;&gt; bad choices that get bad results may that be broken off of her life &gt;&gt; seek It was a generational thing and we break that law &gt;&gt; in the authority of Jesus Christ. The cycle we break it. We come against it in the name of Jesus. Your word like a sword goes to the cycle. We ask Lord &gt;&gt; for better choice, better decisions, &gt;&gt; wiser steps &gt;&gt; that bring godly results in your presence. Redeem, redeem, redeem, redeem, redeem. Lord, my God, in your presence, &gt;&gt; it's him we need. &gt;&gt; That's where I &gt;&gt; It's the Lord we need. seeking your face. &gt;&gt; We don't need bad people. &gt;&gt; We don't need relationships with those who will only destroy us relationships. &gt;&gt; We need him in your presence. Oh God, &gt;&gt; sing it again. &gt;&gt; In your presence. That's where I am strong. In your presence my God here in your praise circuits. &gt;&gt; That's where I belong. Seeking your face, touching your grace. &gt;&gt; Lord, let the weak say I'm strong. &gt;&gt; In the cleft of the rock. &gt;&gt; Let the poor say I'm rich. Let the sick say, "I'm whole." &gt;&gt; In your presence, oh God. &gt;&gt; In your presence, that's where I &gt;&gt; in your presence. Oh Lord my God. &gt;&gt; In your &gt;&gt; in your presence. That's where I am strong. When I'm seeking your face, &gt;&gt; I'm touching &gt;&gt; touching your grace &gt;&gt; in the cliff of the rock. In the cliff of the rock, in your presence, &gt;&gt; in your presence, oh God, &gt;&gt; in your presence, Lord, you are the glory &gt;&gt; and the lifter of our heads. You are the shoulder that we lean on in times of distress. We pray what you gave us for our sister. We just want that to be released over the whole house that every cycle, every circuit would be broken, that &gt;&gt; that that bad decision that gets bad results. We just ask Lord that your light would turn on that for every one of us. That we would get out of that perpetual gerbble wheel of running the same thing over and over again when you've got a whole land. the w the land is wide. The promises for the bride, it's a broad place and we we just resist confinement in this hour. We resist restraint and boundaries that are not godly. And we want to stretch ourselves into the fullness of the promise that you have for us. So right now, we just ask for the wisdom I mean the wisdom of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, would you just put it put it in us? the wisdom, the the the the sevenfold spirit of the Lord. Part of that is the spirit of wisdom. Lord, let that wisdom be birthed in us today that we would make better choices because we want to see God results. &gt;&gt; So, we've got to make God-led choices. Help us to do that. Uh no unsanctified mercy. [Music] &gt;&gt; Come on, &gt;&gt; Lord. Reveal the root of unsanctified mercy in us. It is not your mercy when we give it in an unsanctified manner. When we let people off the hook and don't don't hold them accountable, it's often because of unsanctified mercy. We want the mercy of God and the grace of God. We want that's what we want to show. That's what we want to live under. And that's what we want to show one another. The grace of God. Oh, it's rich. It's boundless. It's endless. &gt;&gt; But it it doesn't support the wrong. It doesn't &gt;&gt; it it it doesn't pet the wrong. It calls into accountability the righteous seed of God. We just surrender. As we leave here today, may we go here with a refresh. Our bodies are tired of sitting here so long, but may we leave with a something in our spirit that that's just pulsing with life. &gt;&gt; Let the life of the word pulse in us. Hallelujah. May we hear the heartbeat of God. &gt;&gt; What is he thinking? What's on his mind? what's on his heart today. Lord, that's what I want to carry with me out of this house. Lord, would you heal the sick, not only among us, but those who were not able to be here today. Let healing break out. It's the children's bread. You are still Yahweh Rafa, &gt;&gt; and you're more than able to heal. Bless these sweet little babies you've sent this way. &gt;&gt; We give you praise and glory for it. It's in the name of Jesus Christ, the precious Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And if you feel comfortable to do so, why don't you just greet one another, hug one another? You're dismissed to go in the lovely name of the Lord in your presence. [Music] Keep chewing along in your presence. God bless you, darling. Oh Lord my God, in your presence, [Applause] that's where I am strong. &gt;&gt; Oh, I seeking your face. &gt;&gt; Touching your grave. &gt;&gt; Touching your grave. &gt;&gt; In the cliff. In the cliff. &gt;&gt; In the cliff of the rock. &gt;&gt; In your presence. In your presence, oh God. In your presence, that's where I in your presence. Oh Lord my God in your presence. &gt;&gt; That's where I am strong. When I'm seek touching, seeking your grace, &gt;&gt; touching your grace, &gt;&gt; your grace &gt;&gt; in the cliff of the rock, [Music] in your presence, oh God, in your presence, [Music] that's where I belong. In your presence, oh Lord, my God, in your presence, that's where I am strong. seeking your face, touching your grace in the cliff of the rock, [Music] in your presence, oh God. [Music] [Music]
