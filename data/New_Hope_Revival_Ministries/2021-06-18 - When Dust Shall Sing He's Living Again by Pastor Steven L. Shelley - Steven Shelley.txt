TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] i stood beside the graveside of a loved one like planning see to watch and wait for spring that's when he returns with all his power and glory he'll call for death to come to life then dust shall sing with us shall see on resurrection morning the saints will rise and let their voices ring those that remain will be changed [Music] shall sing since jesus died the grave has lost its victory and if you're in christ hold death has lost its thing christ conquered death so he'll conduct the cores with voices raised and shouts of praise dust shall sing when dust shall see on resurrection the saints will rise and let their voices leave [Music] sound when dust shall speed oh we'll hear the shout and trumpets out we'll leave the ground wind us shall see
