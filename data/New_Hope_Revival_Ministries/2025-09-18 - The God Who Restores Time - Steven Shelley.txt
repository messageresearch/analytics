Description:
We spend so much of life chasing what cannot be changed, running in circles while God’s purposes fall all around us. Destiny waits — but too often, we let it slip through our hands.

Yet grace is stronger than wasted years. By the power of the Cross, even forfeited moments can be redeemed. What was lost can be reclaimed, and what was broken can still carry you forward into God’s perfect plan.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
We waste too much time, &gt;&gt; worried over over what we can't change, what we can't stop, &gt;&gt; what we can't prevent. We waste too much time trying to do what we're not called to do, what we forget doing, &gt;&gt; what we're called to be doing. &gt;&gt; We run around in circles like gerbles &gt;&gt; to keep our hands busy. While the while the destiny scrolls of the kingdom are just drifting down around us and we're not grabbing something, we stay separated from God's program for our lives. Is there anybody in this house that would say, "I have wasted time. I've wasted weeks. I've wasted months." Some of you might even say, "I've wasted years." And if you let the burden of that get too heavy on your shoulder, you won't be able to walk. You won't be able to praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And so, you've got to believe that what the scripture says is true. That by by the grace of the atonement, we can actually buy back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Forfeited destiny. &gt;&gt; That we did not accomplish and walk in because we were wasting time &gt;&gt; when we should have been buying more time. And that's not with money. That's with doing. &gt;&gt; Because if you'll do what he called you to do, he'll use you &gt;&gt; in ways you've never been used before. &gt;&gt; And when you're in the permissive will of God, your harvest is proportionate. &gt;&gt; But when you're in the perfect will of God, your harvest is proportionate. &gt;&gt; There's an extra oil. There's an extra oil. There's an extra abundance that's added to what we accomplish when we're doing the perfect will of God &gt;&gt; because we have recognized that this is a season. It's a it's a chyros moment. &gt;&gt; There are two kinds of time. Kronos and Cyros or Chyros we say. Chyros in Greek. And Kronos time is what you can tell on the watch and what you can tell on the on the clock on the wall. But chyros time, it's set time. It's appointed time. It's an appointment with an individual, with a church, with a ministry, with a nation. And when you discover the set time, the appointed time, then you have to discover what is the purpose of this time. If we're in a new spiritual season, what is the purpose of this new spiritual season? And that's what we put our hands to. I'm here. &gt;&gt; I will not be denied. &gt;&gt; I believe the same God that met my fathers, the same God who met my grandfathers, the same God who met my great-grandfathers will meet me. And instead of just waiting on him to track me down and nail my hide to the wall &gt;&gt; so he can help me, &gt;&gt; I'll just run to him. And I'll recognize that there's a turning point. There's a divine pivot. It's a moment of decision. I'm at a spiritual crossroads. And I'm I'm being challenged to put my priority back in the word. And then it's up to you. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "We've gone as far with God as we're ever going to go until we're willing to pay a greater price." &gt;&gt; And somebody said, "But you don't know. I can't hardly pay my power bill. I've got problems in my children. I've got problems in my family." Yes. Maybe we do know. Maybe we don't know. But I'll tell you what we do know. He's the answer. &gt;&gt; Revival in your heart is the answer. A refill of the Holy Ghost in your life is the answer. &gt;&gt; Spending time before the throne in worship and adoration, &gt;&gt; that's the answer. &gt;&gt; Get your eyes off of the problem and get them on the problem solver. His name is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen.
