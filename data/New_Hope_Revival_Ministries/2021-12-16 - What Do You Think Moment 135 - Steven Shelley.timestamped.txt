[0:18] eat and drink saith he to thee
[0:21] but his heart is not with thee that word
[0:24] thinketh
[0:25] for as he thinketh it means to calculate
[0:29] it means to reckon

[0:49] right so we can't change who we are

[2:00] thoughts

[2:04] your life
[2:05] if something caused you to think
[2:07] differently your life was affected by
[2:09] that that's that's where change listen

[2:36] way you walk out your destiny

[2:41] destiny path it was the way you're
[2:43] thinking about it
[2:45] whether you live your life in the
[2:47] permissive will of god or in the perfect
[2:49] will of god hinges today
[2:53] on how you think
