hallelujah there's a thought that's been on my mind as brother Shelly has been preaching about praise my mind as he talked about the banner the ins sign over the people began to think about the protocol of the American flag and how that if a veteran would see that flag drag in the ground what that veteran would do how he would become upset well there's some veterans around here and we don't like to see the flag dragging the ground we don't want to see the flag dragging the ground we want to put our banners up high in adoration to the King of Kings and the Lord of lords for he is worthy

seated real quick and we want to give God praise for the I need a little time this morning so I'm going to go ahead and give God praise for the musicians and let's thank them for all that they do praise God praise God isn't he good I I mean he's really good praise the Lord you you might want to turn that off they might they might get cold I don't know are you all cold hot War you're which are you leave it on leave it on for a few minutes uh brother Josiah's been working over there I I I really appreciate them being here like I said Tuesday night I didn't even get to see them the last time that they were here I know only I don't know them well but I I have enjoyed the the AO family uh at at Harmony in the desert and uh Katie's family is a very special family in Tucson there's nobody that doesn't know them that's the truth her dad cannot be missed he's about 10 foot two not really but he's a giant but in the dealing that I had with him I found out he's a gentle giant and I like that a lot two different times when we were in Tucson and we had all of our kids with us and we needed an extra vehicle to do some running around they loaned us their vehicle and I appreciated that very much and the other thing that stands out in my mind is I had the privilege a few harmonies back when we were still at the at the hotel to sit near her grandparents and uh there's one thing you should know about them and that is they have a heart to Worship the Lord and I so enjoyed sitting near them and they said the same to me because we both had a heart not to be entertained we were w't there to be entertained we were there to Worship the Lord and the other thing that stands in my mind about sister Katie's grandmother is that uh sister green used to tell me every time now Sister Green was not that forgetful she was actually very sharp and had a unbelievable memory and could talk tell stories point out landmarks while directing me in driving all at one time and she never missed a turn I would get to listening and I would miss a turn and she'd say brother Steve aren't you going to turn we're coming up on our turn and she said to me one time that woman right there pointing at sister Katie's grandmother she said that woman right there not even attending our church through the years but she has been more of an encouragement to me than just about anybody I know she said every week I go to the mailbox and there is a card from her grandmother encouraging my heart you know that means something that means something so that's the kind of stock that she comes from and how talented they are and how anointed they were in singing they they have been worshiping for some time with with Brother John Andes in Washington and we are thankful that's the church where uh Solomon and Zion are and so we're glad to be able to share them for a little while here God is good for those of you who care I could say hak to you and that means have a joyful uh holiday and uh I have I have uh it's still a battle between light and darkness it is it's a spiritual battle and it's still going on in many many many ways and uh you know I believe there are people who are under an anti-semitic spirit and they don't even realize by the things they say and some of the actions that they do that they really are Jew haters and you know a great portion of the church is anti-Semitic even some message churches are anti-semitic because they believe in replacement theology I I hear ministers in this message preaching replacement theology on a fairly regular basis but I will assure you that God has not permanently divorced the Jewish people he married her back if you'll read the scripture amen and uh he has grafted you in Romans 11 he's grafted you in and you branches better be careful how you boast against the against the root boy you're really helping me I might preach this morning you better be careful how you boast because had it not been for them now we believe what brother brandham said about Jesus not being a Jew but I I like to explain that a little differently because if he were not a Jew in some sense he would have never been able to be the Messiah the Messiah of the Jews could not have been a gentile so for all intense and purposes when God created his blood he created him some blood like nobody else in the world had he placed him in a Jewish womb come on in a Jewish Home in a Jewish Community that's right and he worshiped God according to the customs and traditions of his day amen when that little woman said if I can but touch the him of His Garment we know that Jews did not wear hymns in their garments during the second temple period unless they were very wealthy in fact it was a sign if a man had a hym in His Garment that he was a wealthy man of great esteem and when when he came our Messiah came he came humble he came lowly he did not wear the garments of a wealthy man and so there's only one explanation for what it could mean when the woman said if I can but touch the Hemm of His Garment she was not talking about the Hem of His gown or his robe she was talking about his zit seit those threads that were given as instructions by God and reminders and tied in such a way that even the knots declared the unpronouncable name of God Amen that's powerful so when she said if I can but Touch the Hem of His Garment she knew if she could get a hold of the name of God hallelujah that the virtue that was in him would make her every wi hole hallu God's good isn't he he's good all the time let's see let's mention real quickly that I I mentioned already that today was their one anniversary I can't even remember our first anniversary honey but I know it was good it had to be good I was in it you were in it had to be good I started to make my old joke that she wore out you know the first year sure was hard first five years and now it's the first 26 years sure we're hard but we made it uh today is Sister Pam Powell's birthday and I know that maybe sometimes we forget about her because she's not here she works a lot but she is still a part of this body she reaches out for prayer from time to time and she Faithfully supports this work with her tithe today is her birthday I want to send her a very happy birthday and our love and um uh then on Wednesday of this week Brother David man is going to be about 39 again or something like that and we want to wish him a very happy birthday [Applause] too okay I've got a lot to cover would you stand 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verses 19 and 20 in the King James version what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own for ye are bought with a prize does anybody know what that price is The Incorruptible blood of the Lamb therefore glorify God [Music] in your body and in your spirit which both belong to God which are gods in the Amplified it reads like this do you not know that your body is the temple the very sanctuary of the Holy Spirit who lives within you whom ye have received as a gift from God you are not your own you were bought with a price purchased with a preciousness and paid for made his own so then honor God honor God and bring glory to him in your body does that make sense to anybody let's have a little prayer father we thank you for your anointing in this service today and and I just want to thank you that in the midst of all the sickness that you left a Remnant who would be untouched uh or who would quickly recover and be able to be here this morning because you knew that you had a word we we don't need any sermonettes we we need a word from God and you knew that we needed a word from God and you knew that there would need to be somebody here to pool and so I thank you for every Hungry Heart That is here today I thank you for hosts of people who are streaming this service on YouTube and Facebook and revival. org and the app we send love and appreciation to all of them we ask Lord that as we uh approach a um slightly difficult subject today that you would anoint our hearts and you would anoint our ears to receive it and you would anoint me to release it even as you have purposed it for us and we will give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it all for it's in the name of the Lord Jes Jesus Christ bashem Adonai Yeshua hamashiach that we pray and the church said you may be seated my uh subject today is recapturing cleansing and rededicating your temple to the Lord recapturing cleansing and rededicating your temple to the Lord I I want to just share some things with you before we go to the book of First Kings in just a moment and David I need you to come with your Bible oh no I don't guess you really need you can read it off the screen but it looks more official for you to have your Bible Alias is unable to be here today just a minute uh uh ellias is unable to be here today and uh there's a lot of reading that means there's going to be a lot of listening and there's no need in me using my voice unless I have to redo what he does no need in using all my voice up for that I want to turn your attention today to the dedication of Solomon's Temple after 7 years the building of God's temple in Jerusalem was completed and King Solomon summoned everyone to assemble in Jerusalem for the dedication of this place where God's presence was promised to dwell on Earth but it was more than just a dedication of a building it was also an opportunity for the people to rededicate themselves to God's service following his prayer of dedication for the temple in First Kings 8: 23- 61 King Solomon offered a blessing for the people of Israel in which he had five basic requests number one he requested God's presence to be with his people number two he requested for the desire to do God 's will in everything number three he requested the desire and ability to obey all of God's Commandments number four he asked for God's help with daily needs and number five for people everywhere to know the one true God of Israel as a reflection through his people now those are five beautiful blessings blessings that Solomon prayed over the people and I would like to say the same thing over you that you might know God's presence that you might desire his will in everything that you might desire the ability and strength to obey all of God's Commandments to help God to help you with your daily needs and that God would let you be Al light to all people that would be my blessing for you David I need you to start reading First Kings chapter 8 verse 23 and we're going to read from 23 to 61 that's a lot of reading so I would just ask that everyone here would give us David and myself and the Holy Spirit your undivided attention because of there is a foundation that must be laid for what we're going to share today all right right David begin and he said Lord God of Israel there is no God like thee come on in Heaven above or on Earth beneath who keepeth Covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart do you believe that read on who H has kept with thy servant David my father that thou promised him thou speakest spakest also with thy mouth and Hast fulfilled With Thine hand as it is this day yes therefore now Lord God of Israel keep with thy servant David my father that thou Hast promised him saying there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel so that thy children take heed of their way that they walk before me as thou Hast walked before me amen and now oh god of Israel let Thy word I pray thee be verified yes which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father Yes but God will indeed dwell on the Earth but will God but will God indeed dwell on the earth behold the Heaven and the heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that I have built my my yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant and to this supplication oh Lord my God to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thou which thy servant prayed before thee today yes that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day think about it even toward the place of which thou Hast said my name shall be there that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place yes and hearken to the supplication of thy servant and of thy People Israel yes which they shall pray toward this place when they shall pray toward this place and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and when thou hearest forgive forgive Lord If any man trespass against his neighbor and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear and the oath come before thine altar in this house then hear thou in heaven and do and judge thy servants condemning the wicked and to bring his way upon his head yes and justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousness condemn the wicked and justify the righteous all right read on when the people when thy people when thy People Israel be smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall turn again to thee and confess thy name and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house a way for repentance is being made then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy people Israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers yes when the heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee come on if they pray toward this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou Afflicted them when they look to this Holy Hill that's right that you have ordained and place your name on it when they pray toward this place I want you Lord to hear prayer read on David good job then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy People Israel that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk amen and give rain upon thy land which thou Hast given to thy people for an inheritance Solomon knew that the people would not always obey he knew that rain would be withheld he's really praying a very prophetic prayer that's right he knew that rain would be with held but he said oh God when they recog ognize what they've done and turn to this place in prayer I want you to forgive them this is Solomon negotiating with God telling God how to keep Covenant with his people I appreciate God not killing him read on if there be in the land famine if there be pestilence blasting Milo Locust or if there be caterpillar if there be if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities whatsoever plague whatsoever sickness there be what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man any man or by all thy People Israel you hear that yes sir By Any Man any go any among the Nations remember that this house was to be a house of prayer for all nations not just the nation of Israel so he puts in here be made by any man or by all thy People Israel read on David which shall know every man the plague of his own heart right and spread forth his hands toward this house right then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and do and give to every man according to his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou even thou only knowest the hearts of for thou even thou thou only knowest the hearts of all the children of men how many of you believe he knows he knows today what's in your heart he knows what's in my heart when you assume or presume to know what's in my heart you're sinning against God that's right that scripture when Jesus said judge not that you be not judge the Bible tells us that every righteous man judgeth with the righteous judgment so why is Jesus telling us not to judge because the meaning of that word judge in the Greek is to examine the motives of one's heart you are never to examine the motives of someone's heart you can judge their actions you can judge their deeds you don't judge it by your likes and dislikes you judge it by the word you don't do that to condemn them you do that to prayerfully help them but you ever have the right and if you do it God will do the same to you he said remember I I if you measure out this kind of judgment just remember it's coming back to you because this was the presuming to know the motive of somebody's heart God is is hearing this prayer we know it because history tells us that God was was doing what what Solomon was asking him to do read on D David that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers read on moreover concerning a stranger that it is not that is not that is not of thy People Israel but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake you see even in the older Covenant God was making way for Nations to come and embrace the god of Israel read on for they shall hear of thy great name oh the fame of Your Great Name is going to spread across the world read on and of thy strong hand right and of thy stretched out arm when they they shall come and pray when he shall come and pray toward this house that's right read on hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for that all people of the earth May Know Thy Name to fear thee as do thy People Israel yes that they may know that they may know that this house which I have builded is called by thy name praise the Lord If thy people will go out to battle against their enemy whether soever Thou shalt send them and shall pray unto the Lord toward the city which thou Hast Chosen and toward the house that I have built for thy name then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication and maintain their cause he's not covering Wars that God doesn't instigate he said if I send you out if God sends them out I want them to be able to call call on God toward this place and have their need met Solomon recognized the difference between being called and being sent and just those who got up and went right read on if they sin against thee for there is no man that sinth not and thou be angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy far or near and it happened more than once yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whether they are carried of captives and repent and make supplication unto thee in the land in the land of them that carried them captives saying we have sinned and have done perversely we have committed wickedness and so return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies which led them away captive and pray unto thee toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers that the city which thou H has chosen and the house which I have built for thy name powerful then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place and maintain their cause even in a Strange Land even in a heathen land even while in captivity even while having their sins dealt with Lord if they should call On Your Great Name toward this place even though they're many miles from Jerusalem many miles from Mount Z many miles from Mount morah many miles from the Holy Hill of the Lord hear their prayer Solomon is covering a lot of ground you're doing good David read on and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee and give them compassion before them who carried them captive that they may have compassion on them for they be thy people and thine inheritance which thou bought broughtest forth out of Egypt from the midst of the Furnace of iron yes come on that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant and unto the supplication of thy People Israel yes to hearken unto them in all that they call For unto thee that's right for thou didst separate them from listen now among all the people of the earth to be thine inheritance as thou spakest by the hand of Moses th th servant when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt oh Lord God stay with us and it was so that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the Lord he arose from before the altar of the Lord from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven and he stood and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice saying blessed be the Lord that hath given rest unto his people isra is according to all that he promised there ha not failed one word of all his good promise Hallelujah which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant come on the Lord Our God be with us as he was with our fathers yes let him not leave us nor forsake us amen that he may incline our hearts unto him to walk in all his ways yes sir and to keep his Commandments and his statutes and his judgments which he commanded our fathers and let these my words wherewith I have made supplication before the Lord be nigh unto the Lord Our God day and night that he maintain the cause of his servant and he cause of his people Israel at all times as the matter shall require that all the people of the earth may know that the Lord is God that all may know that the Lord is God and that there is none else read on let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord Our God to walk in his statutes and to keep his Commandments as at this day now if you know anything about this glorious day 7even years of preparation and building to get this temple in place how many of you know that the sound of a hammer was not allowed at the side of the building of the temple that means that outside the city of jerus Jerusalem in the quaries some of the stones coming from underneath the city how many of you have ever stood in Solomon's Quarry in Jerusalem many of us have stood there and it's a huge cave system and it sets right underneath the the wall of the Old City to this day and many of the stones that were used to build the temple were taken out of the of really the Mount the rock of morah or Mariah Mount Moriah and they were they were not allowed to make any sound once they were laid in place so they had to be cut with such Precision that they would fit perfectly together with without nail without connective structure they had to be able to fit together laid quietly no noise have you ever been around a construction crew can you imagine a a building being built with no noise it was so holy and so sacred that the sound of a hammer could not even be heard it was cut with such Precision that just like they said about the Pyramids of Giza you couldn't get a razor blade between the stones and everything had to be just right remember they were following in a pattern that had been shown to Moses in the Tabernacle of the Wilderness and now the presence of God and the furniture that God had given uh as as replicas or duplicates of that which is in the Heavenly places it was now to be rebuilt refashioned it would be exactly like God commanded and instead of God dwelling in a in a temporary tent of travel he would now live in a house a finished house remember the burden that struck the heart of David what a shame it is that we're living in our sealed homes and the and the glory of God is dwelling in a tent we've got to raise up and do something about it and they did and wouldn't you think by all that we have just reminisced that every king would have taken it upon the themselves to protect that Holy building doesn't it sound to you like that every king would want to improve it he he would want to maintain it he would want to maybe even rededicate it and and always keep it before the people but how many of you know that wasn't the case multiple times through the generations of the Kings and in the books of Chronicles we read that Kings would do that which was right in their own eyes we're not talking about Kings of pagan lands we're talking about Kings of Israel The Chosen nation of the Lord and then you would understand that Israel would be divided no longer United Kingdom but now it would be Judah and Israel and each would have their own King and they would war against themselves if you study through the Kings and the Chronicles you will understand that there was even a time that a Pagan Temple and not just one but multiple ones were raised up in the name of Yahweh so that the Nations could go easier to this location God didn't say I want to make it easy for you he said I'm going to choose one place I'm going to put my name on that place and if you want to worship me you've got to pray toward that place now this is important not because God has just one church and no church if you think I'm preaching that you're off uh but there is one truth there's one message there's one revelation of Jesus Christ it's upon this message that God has chosen to place his name in the end time and therefore we cannot worship God under the names of blasphemy we can only worship God under the name of the revelation of Jesus Christ which is not brother bram's message it's Jesus's message he used him as a mouthpiece for the seventh angel he deserves our honor and our respect but not our worship and he must not be our main focus we must keep our balance in the scripture and we must use God's word as our absolute to judge any and all other things that may be shown or happen Among Us are you with me so they even raised up I've been there I've been to the ruins of the false Temple that was raised up in Dan how many of you have been brother gy was there if you were ever with me in Dan uh maybe not every time but most every time because it's a hikee and once you get out the oldest architectural gate in the world is in t Dan it is the Gate of the city of Dan it is the gate that Abraham walked through and it is perfectly preserved now you can't go walking in and out of it but it is perfectly preserved and you can see it standing there as a testament to this day that God's word is true but on The Far Side near the near the headwaters of the Jordan River the beginning place for the Jordan River to flow and remember it flows all the way down fed by the streams of Mount Hermon and it flows all the way down through the nation of Israel into the the knesset or excuse me ganit the Sea of Galilee it flows out of the sea the same river flows out out of the Sea of Galilee near the baptismal yardan where we baptize many of you it flows out of the Sea of Galilee it flows all the way down through the Wilderness Jordan on one side Moab on one side Israel on the other side and the the river itself empties into the Dead Sea now the Dead Sea is dead and therefore there is no Outlet right so the Jordan River Flows In and streams of the desert will flow in during the winter seasons the Rainy Seasons but there are no Outlets so the mineral deposits are so rich and so heavy in that area that you can literally just turn loose if you can relax it's a little hard to relax but if you can relax the water will lift you up you'll go right back on your back have you ever seen pictur of someone reading the newspaper in the Dead Sea it's very easy to do because it turns you right back up now every year people die in the Dead Sea because they swallow the water they get to struggling they get to not relaxing they struggle and they swallow the water and the water is so full of minerals that it often will choke them and drown them that same river that flows from Dan flows all the way down to the Dead see and just over there close to where those Waters begin is the ruins of the false Temple that was raised up uh it had a holy of holies it had an outer Court it had all the things uh on a minuscule scale a miniature scale I guess you'd say and people were encouraged to come and worship there but God didn't receive any of the worship did you know there is a worship that God will not receive receive sir you say God wants everybody to worship him he does you know how in spirit truth and in truth God is seeking for such to worship Him in spirit and in truth worship done any old way come on in any old place come on with any old life on is not acceptable to God I regret having to say that but you know it's the truth you you can worship God in any condition but he doesn't receive Worship in any condition he has a place that he put his name he has a requirement for a life whosoever to ascendeth the hill of the Lord must do so with a clean heart and with holy hands now this would seem unfair is anybody listening this would seem unfair if if the way to get that clean heart uh pure heart and Clean Hands was so difficult that you had to jump through 30 different Hoops to get there if it was so religious that you had to uh you had to offer 11 different blood offerings or if it was so complicated that a plain simple-minded man like me would not even be able to find the way then I'd say to you God has required something that is unfair but it's so easy to get a clean heart it's so easy to get a pure heart it's so easy to get clean hands we've got a blood amen you know that song There is a blood let me tell you there is a blood and the life of that blood can cleanse your heart it can wash your hands and it can give you the opportunity to ascend the Holy Hill of the Lord and worship him in Zion how many of you recognize that Zion is no longer a physical Hill Zion is a people they're the called out remnant of the Lord in these last days and God is still dwelling in Zion hear what I'm saying he's still dwelling in Zion among his chosen still today both Jew and Gentile one new man now multiple times Through The Years a king would follow his own heart he would try to improve upon God's religion now we say religion Loosely we mean the truth of God's uh instructions you know the word Torah is really wrongfully translated law it's instructions the purest translation of the word is the instructions of the Lord and why did he why did he give us instructions sometimes called Commandments because he loved us because he trusted us and he knew that if we would love him with a pure heart we would follow his instructions if you love God and don't follow his instructions keeping his Commandments the Bible said you're a liar and the truth is not in you so if you love God oh but she love I've heard this I grew up in the South come on now I know we are being invaded by non-southerners thank the Lord but I grew up in the South and and and you know people would say about everybody she just love the Lord he just loved the Lord like that was all it takes that that's vitally important but loving the Lord is not enough because if you say you love me and you don't follow my instructions you're lying and no liar can enter into that Kingdom how many of you know that's what the scripture teaches so if they knew somebody had lived like the devil and it was time to bury them they thought they could just kind of Fudge on the truth by telling everybody how much that person loved the Lord but love has a price there's a cost to loving God and that is we must surrender our own will our own way our own choices he gives us a free will and then we turn around and give it back to him I don't I don't want to keep choosing for myself I don't want to keep having my own will I want to give you back my free choice I want you to choose for me I I want you to direct my life I want you to direct my steps is anybody hearing me this morning unfortunately there were many times during the times of the Kings of Israel when the temple would fall into disrepair and eventually God would raise up a restorer he would raise up a repairer of the breaches to repair and rededicate the place where God had chosen to place his name and where God had chosen to meet with his people David nine verses please of 2 Kings chap 21 beginning in verse one Manassa was 12 years old when he began to Reign huh can you imagine anybody in here 12 years old none of the children are 12 years old where are the children I don't even see many one with help from Mom 12 years old can you imagine Gregory can you imagine her being King she probably already is partially at your house the queen one of the Queens at least 12 years old leading the nation read on David I forgot you go ahead and he reigned 5 and5 years in Jerusalem now 55 years that's a lot that's good that's how many years I've lived on the earth God bless him and his mother's name was hepah hepah that's right and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord oh my not even a teenager after the Abominations of the Heathen whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel you know what was wrong with him he was watching MTV come on he he got hooked on country music he got hooked on what the world was hooked on he got to following the trenders yes he got got to following the sports stars signing $700 million contracts he got hooked on some of that he got hooked on the most valuable player the best pop singer come on he got hooked on the world and he began to he began to mix stay with me he began you know the world brother brandom said the world has mixers but God has separators God said said I don't want you mixing with the hether Nations I want everything about you to be different remember he said I don't even want you to wear garments he's speaking to Israel now under the older Covenant and he said I don't even want you to wear garments that are of mixed fibers when I come in contact with those extreme commandment Keepers who tell me that they keep the Sabbath and they observe the festivals of the Lord which is virtually impossible to do without a temple that's right you may work toward it you may celebrate it you may commemorate it but it's nearly impossible for you to keep it right I will ask them about their underwear yes come on does it have spandex in it if it does you're not a good Jew you see how ridiculous people can get because to mix anything with a with a with a natural fiber to M to mix two natural fibers would have disqualified to mix silk and cotton would have disqualified a Jewish person from worshiping in the Holy Temple come on now he said not only that I want you to be known so for me what is God saying God's saying I want you to be known for the way you dress I want them to be able to look at you from from the outside I see your heart but man looks on the outside so even from a distance I want them to be able to look at you and the way you're dressed and know that you belong to me and nobody else hello I want them to know you're not a Babylonian I want them to know you're a a Israelite a Hebrew he said I don't want you to plant your peas and corn in the same row I don't want to come along your Fields your farms and find flowers and a and uh uh seed that produces fruit or vegetable in the same row I want a single row dedicated to A Single Seed why would he do that because he when when the people of other nations would come walking by he wanted them to know this Farm doesn't belong to the government this Farm doesn't belong to the Hittites or the jebusites amen this Farm doesn't belong to the brandit or the shell IES or any other kind of IES I want them to know that this Farm belongs to a people whose God is the Lord who is a jealous God over every aspect of their lives everything about them must scream I belong to Je HOV or yve I belong to yve I belong to the Living God this is powerful to know powerful to know and so because of that men young men old men here's a 12-year-old mixing in the Abominations of the Heathen now what does the word abomination mean it means something that God abhor sometimes we translate that in English are you still with me yes sometimes we translate that in English something that God hates but remember that hate is in degrees Like Love is in degrees in the Hebrew and in the Greek language so is hatred and there is a hate above all hates it is a a an abhorrence if God says I hate that in English and the word is abhor it's translated as abhor it's a strongest degree of hate right right and so God says it is an Abomination don't get quiet yet I hate it when men wear garments it's going to get quiet that pertain to women and women wear garments that pertain to men somebody said well now what qu what qualifies something as being a man's garment and a woman's garment you know what women used to say to me they'd say well I'll tell you right now I'll tell you right now my pants didn't come from the men's department that's not what it said that's right it didn't say what it was manufactured for hello now you going to have to help me or be quiet it it didn't say it didn't say what it was manufactured for it didn't say what department you buy it in it said that which pertains manlike woman likee if something has got [Music] legs now I know I know sisters wouldn't dare be caught in a pair of jogging pants in public but we'll wear them in home I know sh don't get mad yet it's been a long time little Holiness won't hurt nobody I know there's sisters it would only wear a long dress in public but pajamas in private remember the Bible didn't say what you wear 12 hours of the day better be man me pertaining to men if you're a man pertaining to a woman if you're a woman anybody with me woo this won't get me many reals likes on reals come on this won't get me popular a going but it's what I believe and I believe it's based on the word and this this I'm not angry about it I'm just using it as an example that God knows what he likes and if you don't care I don't want to be ugly and sound like I'm cussing but if you don't give a hoot that's so Southern I could have said something else I hear people using words like flip and so forth I don't want to say it like that too too close to other words you know euphemisms can be dangerous but here in the South we used to have a campaign against pollution that's right from hoodie the owl was his name hoodie I'm making that up I don't remember what his name was wasn't it ho hoodie the Al and he said give a hoot how many ever remember seeing it hope woo you old antiques give a hoot don't pollute woodsy who' name an now woodsy woodsy D you you might think in your mind that that God don't care that that that he don't really give a hoot about little things you take one look at this book come on brother and you will know that every curtain God designed it in this book if it hung in the Tabernacle of the Wilderness or in the temple God had a design for it he knew what he wanted embroidered on it he knew what color the threads ought to be he knew what color The Fringe ought to be he knew how many sockets there ought to be to hang it up and how many poles to keep it up and what those sockets and poles should be made out of and if you don't care if you don't give a ho like the world would say maybe what God likes then do what you want to do brother but if you care what he likes somebody said am I going to hell for doing something well I I'll be honest with you there's some things that I don't know whether you would go to hell for or not but I will tell you this what is wrong with us that we would want to participate in something that God says I hate that that's right now if you happen to ask me why God hates it I would have to tell you it's because it Blends together something God said I want to keep very separate I want men to dress like men and and women to dress like women and he even the world knows that because you go to McDonald's and you you don't have to read the men or the women they've got a stick figure there I know folks are getting woke now and they don't know what they are and they're binary do you remember a day when people told us not to homeschool our children because we would make recluses and freaks out of them because they wouldn't be able to get along in the real world if we didn't send them to public school we were going to give them closed minds and they weren't going to have good life did you know that over there at the public schools there are children that think they're rabbits did you know there are people over there in the public school system that think they're fluffy animals and they dress like stuffed animals and they have big conventions come on your little child is not going to be warped because you kept them at home the word of God said you teach these precepts to your children and your children's children I didn't call you out of Egypt to put you on a school bus and send you [Applause] back the only redeeming factor is some of you sisters who have at least some influence in that Heathen Society if I was going to have to if I had to send my children to that kind of a system I would love it if a teacher with a the skirt come out to teach my children so they're blessed to have a Jennifer they're blessed to have a Jenna they're blessed to get on a school bus and have charity driving that bus or sister Alita driving that bus who else anybody else drive now Sister LL driving a bus they're blessed they don't know about they don't understand it perhaps but they they put their kids on that bus with somebody who sees them who learns about them who prays for them who sometimes comes to church and requests prayer for them but you and I got to do better for our children we've got to keep them out from under that influence I've got to hurry if it's an Abomination it means God hates it he wants us separate he wants people to be able to look at you from across the room and know who you are your hair sister is a glory to you it puts power and authority on your head and not just to keep the scissors out of it but the way you twist it the way the way you fix it the way you do it the way you present it God even cares about that people are supposed to look at you and see that hair on your head and find that somewhat attractive not meaning in some sensual way but to see it there and think wow that's that's really something what they don't realize is that's not you just wanting to be different than everybody else that's you wanting to have because of the Angels you want to show the world your place in the economy of God's submission and because of that he puts power on your head I want to tell you something that'll get me in trouble when a lired holy ghost woman prays in tongues hell has to [Applause] shake it has to shake it don't know what to do with a woman that has power on her head it doesn't know what to do with a woman that has a language that hell can't understand so you glory be to God so you sisters realize what God's given you I know it's not easy I know it's wearisome to you I know it's hard on you sometime to maintain that and keep that I know you have to spend money I know it cost you something because you can't just run down here to Walmart and buy any shampoo on the Shelf if you do it'll fall out come on you'll poison yourself l oh I know some stories you'll poison yourself it cost a little bit you have to put a little more money into it come on you have to buy a little something a serum or a or a treatment or something uh to to make it to to to maintain its healthiness and some people go their whole life and never really find what works the best for their hair I want to tell you men something don't you run your lip amen if she spends an extra dollar or two to maintain what God calls her glory there you now preach it now brother if she needs I never preached this in my life I'm so off if she needs a little conditioner or something you know I'd be careful about sending her to the beauty parlor cuz that's what got Lot's wife in trouble but but but whatever it takes I I really do believe that a man a Godly Man man W want to say anything if a if a a a sister said honey I found something here that's supposed to work every one of you ladies ought to be taking collagen and every one of you ladies ought to be doing something to help strengthen your hair because it's a glory on your head it's supposed to look attractive and when I say attractive I don't mean in the way that that's seductive I mean is you know I'm so weird come on that when I meet a Pentecostal woman that's got her hair all done up I I just love it I just love it I just love it I think they might get carried away I don't think it has to set that high I I don't believe the higher the hair the closer to God but there is something about a woman who wants to keep her hair uncut if you listen to the Jackson nightes you'll you'll trim it an inch at a time until there ain't nothing left you'll get caught up in all of that you got straight hair you'll want permanent curly hair you got permanent curly hair you'll want straight hair come on don't let it be a stumbling block to you just say Lord I'm not doing this because I want to I'm doing this because I discover that it somehow pleases you I don't even know if I know why and in the same manner a man is supposed to have shorter hair he's not supposed to have a ponytail a man [Music] bun how do you know that's right you don't even have to be holy ghost filled to know that the Bible said nature itself teaches you that it's a shame now I happen to believe I have friends in the in the anabaptist in movement that believe that the long hair then requires a covering I'm not one of those I believe that your long hair has given you for a covering but God covered all of these things because he wanted us to be a different people I got to hurry I don't know how I I can't tell you how I got on that where what are you doing what are you supposed to do you know what you're can you help me out can you help me David all right now so there were many times during the times of the Kings when the temple fell into repair read this manessa was 12 years old I done forgot all about it 21 or or two well go back to verse one because they forgot to manasse was 12 years old all that come out because he was 12 go ahead when when he began to Reign and reigned 550 and5 years in Jerusalem and his mother's name was havah read on and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord after the Abominations of the Heathen whom the Lord Lord cast out before the children of Israel he picked up the little ways of the other tribes come on for he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed that's that's those Groves they built those Groves they built altars up in the Groves of trees on tops of the hills they decked them out they decorated them up and then in uh Jeremiah in the times of Jeremiah they decided that they weren't pretty enough just to go up on the hill and pray up there in the Grove OR at the high altars we will now cut those things down no they weren't Christmas trees no such thing as Christmas they weren't Christmas trees but they said we'll we'll cut them down and fasten them in the floor with a nail and deck them with gold and silver we'll bring them into our homes and that's why Jeremiah said learn not the way of the Heathen because just going up in the Grove wasn't enough I I'm just going to say this the Holiness preachers preached against the movie theater at least you had to leave and go over to the movie theater and now what has happened is we brought the movie theater and worst into our hands if we're so inclined we better be careful to keep a pure heart and Clean Hands it's time to reconsecrate it it's time to recapture the house of the Lord it's time to reconsecrate the house of the Lord rededicate it clean it up first cleanse it up and then give it back to God read on David it's late and he reared up altars for Baal and made a Grove as did Ahab king of Israel and worshiped all the hosts of heaven and served them they even began to worship Angels Heavenly Creatures they even made little statues of them and worship them I'm not saying because you have a statue of an angel you're worshiping it not saying that at all but be careful what you worship be careful what you put your attention to read on and he built altars in the house of the Lord oh now he's he's was in The Groves he was out there on the high places but now the king dared to come into the temple of God and rearrange the furn Furniture it's not your place to rearrange the furniture in the house of the Lord it's not your place to add to the house of the Lord on your own without any Authority read on of which the Lord said in Jerusalem will I put my name one place and he built altars for all the hosts of Heaven and the two courts of the house of the Lord think about the just just redoing things things not according to the Heavenly pattern at all now look at how Wild he got as he got older he got worse and he made his son pass through the fire and observed times and used enchantments and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord to provoke him to anger come on now and he set a Graven image of the Grove that he had made in the house of the made in the house of which the Lord said to David and to his Solomon his son in this house in this house and in Jerusalem which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel will I put my name forever neither will I make the feet of Israel more move anymore out of the land which I gave their fathers come on now only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded if you want to stay in the land if if you want to stay in the promise you got to obey the word read on and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them but they hearkened not and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the Nations whom the Lord destroyed before the children of Israel I want you to know there was more evil being done in Israel than had been done in the Pagan nations of the world what do you think God thought about that I'd say didn't like it very much if you go on to read the rest of 2 Kings 21 you'll find out that another young king rose on the scene and did the same kind of wickedness but that was not to are you with me yes sir I'm going to preach I'm just getting started but I'll hurry best I can now I want you to notice something here when it looked like it couldn't hardly get any worse enter into the picture Josiah a mere boy 8 years old but nonetheless chosen for a man-sized job he had a great Destiny before him Josiah looked at the sight and the state of the temple and said enough is enough he decided to put things back in order and if you want to read that in your own time you can read 2 Kings chap 22 and 23 and 2 Chronicles 34 and 35 but David is going to read seven verses to us here in 2 Kings 22 1-7 let's stay with him Josiah was 8 years old when he began to Reign and he reigned 3 And1 years in Jerusalem and his mother's name was jedah the daughter of adah of boso and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord and walked in all the way of David his father what a contrast two Wicked Kings in a row here and now here comes One 8 years old wanting to do what was right in the sight of the Lord and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left and it came to pass in the 18th year of King Josiah that the king sent shafan the son of aalah the Son Of mulam The Scribe to the house of the Lord saying go up to hilaya to the priest that he the high priest that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the Lord which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people yes and let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work that have the oversight of the house of the Lord and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in in the house of the Lord to repair the branches of the house breaches breaches of the house unto carpenters and Builders and Masons and to buy Timber and Hune Stone to repair the house how be it there was no Reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand because they dealt Faithfully they were trusted sir they didn't just go out and find strangers to come and do the work in the house of the Lord it was a holy place they were doing a holy work reconsecration repairing restoring so they found carpenters and Masons and workers that they could trust and they would give them the money and the work would be done now read 11 and 12 of 2 Kings 23 and we're hurrying and he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given into the son given to the son at the ENT to the Su in horses they had placed huge horses have you ever been to chains PF chains you seen those big horses they put in a lot of them by the door with a Chinese Soldier on top can you imagine going up to the house of the Lord and these huge Idols of horses are sitting there beside because some nut didn't think it looked good enough he wanted to make it look grander he didn't think it was flashy enough or fancy enough come on now little Josiah has to go down and rip those things out of there these these horses they weren't dedicated to the god of of Israel the god of the temple they had been dedicated to the god of the son sat down at the entering end of the house of the Lord by the Chamber of Nathan melik the Chamberlain which was in the suburbs and burned the Chariots of the sun with fire they had chosen their own elaborate decorations for the Holy Temple read on David and the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of ahaz which the kings of Judah had made and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord remember that was we just read about that King did the king beat down he beat down somebody say beat down down he didn't walk in and say excuse me folks I I know that this might be a controversial subject here uh because some of you gave money for these thing but to be bill and I am not here to offend he wasn't like a ramaswami I'm not here to offend I I I hope you all don't mind I'm trying to appeal to everybody see I hope you all don't mind if I carefully remove these extra decorations that you all have added to the house of the Lord what's the bible say that Josiah did Katie you got to watch Josiah Jennifer you got to watch Josiah because they may carry if their mom and dad felt the inspiration of the Lord to to name them by that name they may carry a little bit of that wildness God did that on purpose but it does have to be watched after has to be steward did CU Josiah had no tact I don't I don't I'm not saying you don't my what a pastor can get himself in trouble here like that LE let's say we could all use a little more TX he didn't have any he just went in and got started ripping down those horses and beating down the two courts that had been raised up there and he break them down from then and then what did he do David and cast the dust of them into the brook kid drone I'm throwing you out I'm taking you all the way down to the valley I don't even want the ashes I don't even want the dust to remain on the floor of this Temple as a testimony of your foolishness I'm tearing them down in the name of the Lord it takes a repairer of the breach it takes someone who cares what God loves and what God hates it takes a holy priesthood with a zadok anointing that will come forward and say we're going to hate what God hates we're going to love what God loves and if that offends you we just have no apology to make if you can't worship here because we're standing for what the word said all are welcome but if you find that you can't worship here because we choose to stand on what the word said come on brother you are free that's right I don't take your presence here lightly and I don't take it here for granted I want you here I thank God for every last one of you that I see in this house and those and these streamers but I want you to know if the day ever comes that I would have to sugarcoat it or tiptoe around the Tulips to keep you coming up the hill I'm not interested then I didn't get in this thing for the favor of man I didn't get in this to treat somebody different because of their offering brother I got in this to stay on the word to bring correction when correction is needed whoever needs it that's what we have to do break it down now Josiah let me just give you four points of Josiah's ministry here before we get to the meat of this Josiah's rain began in 639 I know my wife wanted to say to me yesterday but she didn't cuz she was too busy to be where I was but I know when she saw me studying again I know she bad wanted to say honey remember you're not going to get the half of it you don't have to put it all in the notes but she didn't so I put it all in the notes Josiah's Reign began in 639 when he was 8 years old but he began to seek the Lord fully at age 16 in 631 and you will find that in in uh Chronicles in 2 Chronicles chapter 34 at age 20 in the year 627 in the 12th year of his Reign Jose mesiah began an active program of reform in Jerusalem and Beyond at the age of 26 think about it 26 we don't hardly give credit of intelligence of wisdom to someone who's 26 I've had to be reminded here a time or two we are not the children anymore in the church we're now married and we have children of our own give us a little credit so I'm here to give you a little credit if you can accomplish what Josiah was accomplishing at 26 I'll pay more attention to your advice he was really in it amen by the time he was 26 18th year year of his Reign he was sending workers up to rebuild to repair the temple and during the temple cleanup do you remember this the workers found the scroll of the law can you imagine that the very word of God had been lost for generations and it had fallen among the rubble can you imagine today that the word of God has been lost among the Christmas trees and the Easter [Music] eggs listen when when when I got up here this morning I had a I realized I mean I bought it I know I ordered it this black shirt ain't it nice but when I come out here I for a split second I thought I remember the day since some of you came from the Assemblies of God I'll tell you that when I was a boy there was a district superintendent of the Assemblies of God by the name of th Spence and he was known just Assembly of God not strict Holiness Assembly of God he was known that if a preacher would come before him in a colored shirt not white to throw them out of his office and now they've got Thrice married preachers wearing cargo shorts on and wife beater shirts and baseball caps and flipflops standing in the pool pit of their churches oh how far are they Fallen I don't think a man has to wear a white shirt obviously or I wouldn't found this one to wear wore blue last week it was new too but I'm just saying isn't it amazing how you can have something way up here like that and little by little by little can you imagine throwing a man out of his office because there's a I know a pastor in this message that spoke to a brother who come to preach him a meeting with a with a a shirt other than white and if a if a man comes through there with whiskers he'll tell him if he wants to preach he needs to shave so this is not so far away so far removed that we couldn't relate to some of it but can you imagine not wanting a preacher to come for his license with a colored shirt on and now now standing in their poopit they stand there in cargo shorts and flip-flops and yellow toenails and baseball caps and and handle the things of God with their coffee shops and their tattoo parlors and we need Josiah you let a man get a little radical on YouTube and they they B him they they markk him as some kind of crazy fanatic because he wants to call a little bit of righteousness back to the church we need somebody like a Josiah who who don't have enough tact to care and don't even think about what it what somebody for every Josiah it takes a dozen come on to put the pieces back together because he just gets this on his mind and he rips it is anybody with me now I want I want to move into the last part of this sermon it's 122 I'm going to take till two the Lord willing and let you go I want to talk to you for a moment about what is called the inter testamental intertestamental period intertestamental period it's a period of about 400 years it's expands from the ministry of the Prophet Malachi in 420 BCE now remember that BCE is Jewish it means before the Common Era which is the second temple period the time of Jesus it's the same thing as BC before Christ but the Jews are not going to measure time by someone who they don't believe to be the Messiah so in historical documents and in seminary settings they will still refer historically to BCE so don't let that bother you but it lasted from the ministry of the Prophet Malachi which was about 420 bcee to the appearance of the ministry of John the Baptist which was in the early part of the first century ad 400 years that we sometimes call between the Testaments it was 400 years before we started seeing something new arise and other scriptural things written and recorded it took a John the Baptist to stir up the religious crowd come on sir he didn't come with a white shirt and a three piece be suit like they wanted him to right he came in with a with a a camel skin Romper on you know what that looks like a camel skinn Romper on with honey dripping down his beard and when he got hungry he was a uh there are various interpretations of what Locus was the most common to be a bug he's getting his protein from fried Grasshoppers and he's eating them with honey and he's screaming like a wild man calling everybody devils and you know when they when he come on the scene the people of Israel must have said oh I wish we had another Malachi when Malachi was on the scene when jeriah was on the scene when Isaiah was on the scene when Hagi was on the scene Israel wanted him off the scene and then here come John the Baptist and they said oh I wish we had Isaiah back give us an Amos again God's people are never ever satisfied it seems with what they have and they hardly ever recognize or appreciate it until it's gone anybody want to say Amen so if you're getting into Ministry because you want attention or because you want celebration that's right you'll mostly be appreciated at your funeral it's a truth there's no glory I don't know why anybody alive would want to be a pastor you have to say a word I don't even need your amen you're what I'm talking about why would anybody want that responsibility you from one minute you go from God's man of power for the hour and in the next minute you hate my children you know the you know the routine I try not to talk about it too much because I don't want to discourage anybody from obeying God if he calls you you'll have to do it whether you want to or not come on somebody appreciates me I got a I'm just kidding I got a big old box of fudge homemade peanut butter fudge today I cannot say that it is what I need but I must say I am humbly receiving it and I accept it as a great gift of appreciation and to not partake of it would be rude no matter what part of the geographical United States you're from isn't that right so during this intertestamental period there was the sald and the Greek influence and later occupation along with the Romans on the land of Israel soluset Greeks Romans all come calling all wanted to make Jerusalem their Capital there was that period of time that the city of Jerusalem's name was changed to Constantinople not even called after the Holy Name that God had given it and and you cannot imagine the things that changed I need your help just your attention you can't imagine the things that changed under the influence of the solids and the Greeks and the Romans and there were others Alexander the Great was coming to an end his sons and grandsons were crazy too and they wanted to conquer the whole world and every conqueror had his eye on Jerusalem and every conqueror had the same idea rid the world of the dirty Jews and we can rule the world from Jerusalem doesn't matter what conqueror you're talking about now underneath this 400e period gymnasiums were built in in in in Israel and around the world where Jewish and Greek athletes please understand that the Olympics as an event was a religious event and it was in praise to false gods I am not trying to indicate that someone who competes today is doing it in the name of a false god but I'm telling you the origins of it were filthy and in Israel hear me now in Israel gymnasiums were built where Jews and Greeks competed in various indoor competitions remember all competitions up to this time even in Rome were outdoor events held in something like circus maximus's or colise Ms now they're coming inside to a gymnasium a closed in building nothing wrong with the gymnasium but what they decided to do was to let the men stay with me to compete naked now if you don't think that would feed a perverted wrong Spirit and the reason why they does anybody know why because they wanted everybody to know the difference between a Jew and a Greek the Jews would be circumcised and they were the only people circumcising the the forkin of the male member during this time why did they do that because it was a commandment from God God said I not only want you to be known in public but I want you to be known in private that's right because remember the influence of the baths was already in the land of Israel and and public bathrooms and I have gone today the ruins of some of these bathrooms are still there and they're just holes in stone sitting right beside one another where where men would go in and go to the bathroom right in front of everybody the culture of the Greek and the Romans was to put the body on display and that's why there's so many ruins of naked statues around from that time period and they did consider the human body as a form of Art and there's nothing wrong with that except for the fact that they were using that to cheat to differentiate to show racism toward the circumcised remember that Jews had been heniz Greek IED during this period their hair in in many places in Israel the Jews had now trimmed nearly shaved their hair because of heniz they had been strongly urged and later forced to shave their facial hair a man under the natural design of his body with the proper balance of hormones is to have facial hair on it's not so attractive for a woman and under Norm you can laugh it's funny unless you've got the problem then it's not very funny it's hard I feel sorry for sisters who have to battle the balancing of the hormones to get things right don't make fun of it understand that it's a serious problem but wasn't in in the normal balance of the of the chemicals of the body a woman would not have much of facial hair and and a man would but you see the the the Greeks the the seusd this whole influence that came out from under Alexander they didn't want the Jews to be no noticed as Jews so they wanted everybody to look like Greeks I want you to hear this if I need to call your name I will to make sure you're listening to what I'm saying so they wanted everybody to have the same haircut it's kind of like the world operates today they want everybody to have the same haircut and they wanted Jews who under the Commandments of their scripture were not to shave the corners of their beards which means that they were not to to shape it into some kind of design that was more Pagan today we would look at it sort more like a what do you call it goatee they were to leave it pretty much to its natural B orders it was not wrong under C circum certain circumstances to trim it so that it didn't get in your soup but they quit trimming it Jews quit trimming it because they misinterpreted the corners of the Beards to mean side curls and this is why the ultra Orthodox hidic Jew has the side curls that's why boy born into that family doesn't have his first haircut till he's three years old because they want to give him a head start on his P his his uh side curls so they've got all these ideas now the Greeks come in and they they strongly urge them later force them to scrape how natural does that sound you're going to get quiet I'm not preaching Doctrine I'm telling you how it started they didn't want them to look like Jews not in public in private in the gymnasium they wanted to be able to know because if there was any any any any cheating going on of course the Jew would be the one the circumcised man would be the one doing it it was it was a Prejudice it was a racist thing but in public their desire was to get all the Jews to look more and more like the Greeks so some were forced to take sharp rocks and objects and start scraping off skin and pores and blood and hair because they didn't want the Jews looking like God had told them to look according to the scriptures anybody with me so I know that the world has made a beard a worldly thing I was under that same idea for many years coming out of the apostolic and Holiness Church but but really the opposite is true it was the influence of the heniz the solid the Greeks and the Romans that wanted men basically basically to look like women women were cutting their hair in Corinth at the time of Paul women were shaving their heads and wearing short wigs because they Jewish women because they didn't want to stand out they were treated so bad that they didn't want to stand out in society so Jewish women sometimes in Corinth and other cities that shaved off their head and wore short wigs so that the length of the hair was more similar to the length of a man's hair I want you to know that that spirit that tries to blend the genders was already in the Earth the Bible say and wait till I tell you what Spirit it is it's the spirit of antichrist the Bible said the spirit of antichrist does already work in the new New Testament the spirit of antichrist is the spirit of anti-Semitism that's one of the spirits the Prejudice Spirit against the Jews is one of the very spirits that operates under the umbrella of antichrist the spirit that causes a man to want to be a woman and a woman want to be a man to be binary to be neither male nor female right for women to dress the bush and men to dress the queer that Spirit falls under the umbrella I can't help it it takes my breath I don't want to be ugly I don't want to mistreat anybody sir but I cannot help when a when a lumberjack walks over to the table and says hello it takes me by surprise I want to understand the struggles of all mankind but I want you to know it falls under the umbrella of the spirit of antichrist and I don't want anything to do with it any spirit that tries to dehumanize a Jew operates under the spirit of antichrist for you to despise the Feast of the Lord hear me now to despise the Feast of the Lord is to operate under the umbrella of the spirit of antichrist the spirit of antichrist is not a spirit that is against Christ it is a spirit that seeks to replace Christ the spirit of anti-Semitism and these other branches that I have mentioned or or is the spirit that desires to replace yes sir the Jew with the church the Jew with a Greek on a man with a woman right a woman with a man brother brandham saw these Spirits operating in the 50s and 60s when a woman would take a [Music] poodle I need another hour when a woman would choose a poodle rather than to disfigure right her body and childbirth that's right he said there's something wrong with this woman carrying this fuu around in her purse refusing to give her husband a child he saw that as a spirit operating against the family structure let me tell you something I want to say this I tell you I feel good today I I ought to just preach on uh God loves families he loves for families to function together in wholeness that's right and godliness and he hat Satan hates the family and he wants the woman to control the house if he can have the woman controlling the house then he can change everything about the spirit of the family now don't you get on your high horse man because every Moses needs us as Fara even Abraham needed a Sarah sometimes we need to be reminded sometimes we need to be corrected sometimes we need to be helped supported we're not ashamed I'm not ashamed sir to say that I can't do it all I need need help but I don't believe that the woman should rule the house or lead the house I think men are wrong when they put the woman under the burden of finances and then blame her if there's not enough to go around you take the book that's right you do the job you be responsible see how you like it you can only do so much with peanuts come on now God loves the family he loves families I need another water whoever could help me please I it don't doesn't matter so gymnasiums naked competition to distinguish the circumcised Jew from the uncir circumcised Greek wealthy Jews were forced to forsake Hebrew as their language of choice and learn or Aramaic as it was being spoken in that day which is certainly nearly nearly Hebrew in many many many ways but they wanted the common man to speak Greek which proved nearly impossible to believe the scholars when they tell us that the New Testament was not written in Hebrew is sheer ignorance because every one of these men were not lawyers all the gospel writers were not highly educated men they could not have communicated in Greek as years went by more more of the common men began to try to learn Greek but they were writing in Hebrew that was later translated to Greek and later there are there there were forces that be that tried to destroy the Hebrew of for instance the four gospels they did it again an attempt to take it away from the Jewish people and to henize and to Greek eyes or romaniz these aren't words henize is a word it means the same thing even though scripture they wanted to have influence do you know that the reason why we had the Latin Vulgate do you know why the Bible was even translated uh into these other learned languages one of them by St Jerome do you know why it was even done it was done because they wanted wanted a copy of the Hebrew Bible in the library in Alexandria they wanted it sitting there as a trophy on a shelf and and what they did to get it was try to interpret the Hebrew scriptures the Hebrew Lifestyle the Hebrew mannerisms the Hebrew colloquialisms they were trying to understand them and squeeze them into G so most of the Bibles that we have today are translations from the Greek when in fact the Greek mindset was so forign from the Hebrew mindset that we can barely interpret the scriptures in this day we really need the holy spirit's help amen I believe that what is amazing is those beautiful times that the hebraisms come popping through the English Bible and remember that's a miracle because it has come from Greek Latin and finally into English or Latin Greek finally into English whichever the two because there's you know we have the septu agent and we we have other sources it's amazing it's amazing those times you cannot sons of Zion you cannot understand understand the Bible thinking like sons of gree you cannot understand the New Testament you cannot understand the New Covenant unless God gives us some understanding of the old Covenant that's why brother Brandon pointed us back to Passover and he pointed us back to the to the Feast of Pentecost and he pointed us back because the only way to understand the reality and fullness of the new is to have it based yes sir on the Fulfillment of the old you missed a good chance to say Amen so Hebrew names were discarded and the names that we call the men of the Bible are heniz names there was no John in bi in the Bible he was renamed John his name was johanan there was no James there was no there was no you you go through these name every name that we use there was no Moses these are heniz names that were used to to to point to the person Moshe what's his name this enemy wanted to rename them re-identify them mix them with the world water down their religion their faith steal their identity now you tell me that's not the spirit of antichrist Jewish men were in encouraged in some cases forced to scrape the hair from their faces and change their their hairstyles to soo the Greek culture I said that without my notes now do I have a few more minutes I'll never get this in 10 thank you I would like to read to you from the septu please don't fall out of your seat I'd like to read to you from the book or have David to then then it's on him he's responsible blame him I'd like to have him to read quickly one makabe now remember the macbes the book of macbes there were four of them they were never included in the Hebrew scripture but not for the reason that you would think they were not included in the Hebrew scripture because they they painted the hasmoneans or some people say hasmoneans they were they pointed them as true heroes remember that these were nonh heliz Jews right the Jews of the second temple period were highly heniz highly Greek right the the uh macbes who descended from the royal priesthood of the Bible through the family of the of the hasmoneans or Honan they were Heroes because they wouldn't bow to the culture of the day not even to the average Jew so that's why the books were never added to the Hebrew scripture they made the rebels look like Heroes and the religious faithful look like zeros right the Protestants didn't want the book and so although it was a part of the septu agent for for many many many many years the Protestants decided they didn't want it because it was m mainly a historical book and not necessary to be a part of the scripture so I agree today with the Protestants and I tell you I don't believe that this is a a book that has to be added to the Canon of the scripture I don't believe that it is a sacred book in the sense that it should be added to the Canon of our Bible although any Catholic Bible would have these four books in there but they are powerful eyewitness accounts of what happened during the intertestamental period so David read for me just a moment I got to hurry on the 15th day of the month of klev in the year 145 King Antiochus set up the awful horror on the altar of the temple and Pagan altars were built in the towns throughout Judea Pagan sacrifices were offered in front of the house houses and in the streets any books of the law which were found were torn up and burned and anyone who was caught with a copy of the Sacred books or who obeyed the law was put to death by order of the king month after month these Wicked people used their power against the Israelites caught in the towns on the 25th of the month these same evil people offered sacrifices on the Pagan altar erected on top of the in altar in the temple I'm going I'm I'm getting mad now yes sir I'm getting mad now this Antiochus I fourth his father Antiochus III can be pronounced either way Antiochus or anticus was a Greek helenistic king de descended from the solids who ruled the sald Empire from 175 BCE until his death in 164 BCE remember it goes down he was the acting king of Syria when he marched into Jerusalem Syria right you know those missiles yes sir coming from Syria yes sir to the land of Israel he was a Syrian King and he captured Jerusalem in 167 BCE in a minute I'm going to tell you why I light a candle and in a minute I'm going to tell you why we burn a lamp and why we remember the Feast of Hanukkah on and why you're too late come on to change my mind I recognize that Antichrist spirit yes indeed Pagan sacrifices offered in front of houses of Jews now when we say when when the mccabes wrote Pagan sacrifices do you know what it was Pig yes sir so Jews were forced to stay in their homes because pigs were being burned outside their doors most Hebrew homes didn't have a back door so they are forced to stay in their homes until that is burned up and in some cases removed the the any copies and only rich people only Rich Priestly families had copies of the scroll of the law and anyone who was caught in possession of a Bible let's say a Bible today because that's what we understand was forced to turn it in and stand and watch it burn those dogs burn the Bible come on they offered pigs in front of my house come on come on now do you understand what I'm saying they shaved my beard they made me cut my hair to look more like a woman so that I could fit Society they wouldn't let me speak my own language they tried to force a language that I was too ignorant to learn right then they begin to kill us one by one by one if we wouldn't bend if we wouldn't bow if we wouldn't henize if we wouldn't do what they did if they caught us doing what Jews do I'm saying us because I want you to know how personal I take this because when I read to you I feel something here now when I read to you that there's one new man and we are grafted in I get a little emotional yes and when I tell you what brother brandham said when he said I rode with George Washington over the Delaware River and I rode with v r yes when I hear brother bandom say I stood there with those Hebrew boys in the furnace it it lets me know how I did I did it by identification brother Brandon wasn't at the tomb brother Brandon wasn't at the Delaware brother Brandon wasn't in the fiery furnace but he said I'm identified with the god of the Bible you hear what I'm saying it was my children they stole out of my arms it was my children they tried to surgically uncircumcised they were taking the babies and trying to surgically un circumcised them they took tiny babies from their mother's arms crucified them and hung them on a chain around the mother's neck so that everywhere mother went and you get upset because I light a candle to remember what an antichrist Spirit tried to do to my people or because I eat a potato pancake that offends you because I mentioned Hanukkah while you're standing around the Pagan Christmas tree it's an antichrist spirit and if my children are ashamed of it I won't be if my church people are ashamed of it I won't be I'm not asking anybody to participate in what I do but I'm not apologizing to anybody for what I do I have never worshiped a candle I would much rather use the oil like sister Joyce did do you still it has nothing to do with the candle the wax or the oil for me it's a remembrance that that that Antichrist Spirit tried to destroy the Jews just like Hamas come crawling out of the tunnels on October the 7th and tried to murder and these educated idiots in this country who March up and down the street and scream from The River To The Sea are under an antichrist delusion they have no idea what it's like to be one of the hated or one of the hunted but I do because I have identified myself with the suffering of God's people I had family members murdered in the Holocaust I am Associated and identified with the Jewish people so you keep your Easter Bunny you keep your stocking on the on the on the mantle and you tell me how that has anything to do with the scripture but don't you get yourself all twisted up because I take time every year to remember the Feast of the Lord including one like this do I sound angry oh come on you know I do this is been my reality since October the 7th I've lived this I've eaten this I've drank this I've slept this I'm up in the middle of the night looking at my phone I'm up in the middle of the night to the bombs to the alarms right sister uh man tried to get it on the phone and and I think no it's no longer on the on the iPhone allowed outside of the land of Israel but because I downloaded it in Israel I still can have it and I'm notified every time that radar catches a a missile coming out of of from Hezbollah or the hoodies are from Gaza and I get up in the middle of the night and I scroll them by the hundreds and I've seen the videos and I've watched the videos of B burned babies and it reminds me of a time right here between the Old Testament and the New Testament so it's a little bit more to me I say this sometime in Jess but it's a little bit more to me this morning than they tried to kill us we won let's eat it's we must remember because we're sending our children to universities where the uneducated idiots or the educated idiots can't even answer a question presented to them the president of Harvard can't even answer a question if this is against the policy if it was if it was a prejudice against a homosexual or a transvestite or a binary somebody confused nobody would have a problem standing up for them but because the Antichrist spirit is so prevalent in the land and anti-Semitism is celebrated in the universities of our nation and many other with nobody it seems at time to stand up come on when a Jew transfers out of his university because of anti-Semitism and hides at Penn State or pen University of Pennsylvania hides there because he's told that anti-Semitism is is hardly known and now because of October the 7th because of raped women and burned babies and beheaded grandmothers this Spirit has risen up in this land and they don't know how to answer a simple question does this does this violate the policy if it doesn't you need another policy to run through the streets screaming from The River To The Sea doesn't mean Equal justice for the Palestinians or equal justice for the Arabs means nothing like that it means the total Annihilation it means we will drive every Jew into the sea and watch them gurgle until they gurgle no more because we're so against the god of the Bible we're so against a God that differentiates between men and women we're so against a God that differentiates between the righteous and the filthy I'm closing after a while this will this may be took off of YouTube but we're talking about recapturing cleansing and rededicating our Temple and the brides got to do it I hope I'm not upsetting anybody too much Antiochus i 4 epiphanies which means god manifested he believed that he was God In the Flesh he commanded that sacrifices be made to Zeus or to Jupiter on the altar that he had built over the altar of the Holy Temple can you imagine it's one thing what you do in your church but when you come into my church and try to redo or undo you understand what I'm saying he could have made his own a palace he could have had a palace he built he built the Fortress looking over the Temple Mount he raised up Towers to constantly spy on the Jews he could have built his own Temple the temple to Antiochus epifanes I 4th but instead he wasn't satisfied to have his own filthy house of worship he wanted to come into the house dedicated and consecrated to the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he wanted to build a filthy Pagan altar over the the altar that had been used to receive the offerings as commanded in the scripture and then later he wanted to raise up a statue of himself and he did called it God right next to the statue that he raised up of Zeus or or Jupiter the same God according to the Greek or the Roman culture whichever one you're looking at the final act it was more than they could stand we we we stood back when you when you forc Jews to scrape their faces to look like Greeks we stood back when you wouldn't let our children play traditional games that they had played since coming out of Egypt we stood back when you tried to force a needle in our arm I I may be getting my time frames mixed up here a little bit we stood back and we didn't do anything and we let it go on because we wanted to live peaceably with all citizens of Israel but now you're just about to push us over the edge now uh uh Mr uh Antiochus God manifested because now you have not only desecrated our homes with your Pig's blood but you have offered and on that day that famed day that David was reading about is the day that he walked in to the temple and offered a fat swine a big fat pig on this altar that he had erected totally desecrating the house of God totally desecrating all that was holy and righteous slapping in the face for centuries of priests that had walked up those steps to honor God to lift up the name of God to sing the songs of God to to point people to the god of the Bible Dishonored them all to try to turn people's worship toward him he had introduced Pagan prostitution in the temple of God all other Pagan cultures had Temple prostitutes and a man could receive special favors in their religion by laying with one of those Temple prostitutes and so Antiochus brought them to the Holy Temple in Jerusalem the only place at that time where God said I put my name is right here in this city can you imagine being a Jew on in [Music] modin a little village between Jerusalem and the Sea modin I've taken my children there and we've walked among the graves of the mccabes I've showed them the village where Mattias the priest served lived raised five boys including Judah mccabes I've showed them the history of a of a rag tag bunch of boys who said we stood back we watched you do this we watched you take that we watched you change this but now you're getting too close to home yes and our Hasan blood's boiling in our veins and we are not going to take your heniz anymore you're not going to you're not going to shove your tree down my throat anymore I'm going to speak up for what's right if it hair lips the devil and bankrupts Hell Judah McCabe's father lost his life took their circumcised babies from them as I told you a moment ago they killed anyone who had a copy of the Bible biblical text after they burned it in front of them they forbid any any Jewish baby to be circumcised they they forbid that anyone should observe the sabbath they forbid that anyone should require a Kosher diet they forbid that anyone should study the law and on that day the day we read about the Blasphemous King ascends the steps of the temple in Jerusalem he has conquered the nation of Israel and now wants to eradicate the Jews by eradicating Judaism the King enters the temple declares himself to be God manifest on the Earth and and then sacrifices a fat pig on the holy altar that has now been dedicated to Zeus or Jupiter perhaps fulfilling a portion a portion here this fulfilling a portion of Daniel's prophecy concerning the abomination of desolation we believe that according to Jesus who also spoke of the abomination of desolation that there will be a further a further manifestation in the days of antichrist but the Deeds of Antiochus epiphanes were so vile that everyone in history looks at him as a prototype of the Antichrist in seeking to prohibit Judaism and to henize the Jews and tyus forbade their religious practices and followed up this abominable act by requiring every Jew to present the copies of the law to be burned I want to read from Josephus just a moment Josephus is a contemporary give me just a few more minutes please please I'm sorry but I give me a few more minutes can't leave you hanging here Josephus was a contemporary of Matthew Mark Luke and John his words are not inspired he was considered by his Brethren a turncoat but he wrote a historically accurate document as an eyewitness to many of the things that took place including the ministry of Jesus this is what he wrote about what happened Antiochus got possession of the City by treachery at at which time he spared not so much as those that admitted him into it in fact the very the very ones that slipped him into the city so that he could conquer it he killed him first did you know that some of the first people that were murdered on October the 7th were actually peacekeeping kib butnik men and women who lived in kib seim on the border of Gaza who dedicated their lives to driving risking their life driving into Gaza knowing that Hamas could could attack them at any time to take sick children out one of the women who was killed that day one of the women that was taken into hostages worked with with or founded one of them founded an organization the other one worked with an organization that was physically going in bringing sick Palestinian children out play placing them in the care of Jewish doctors and after they received their treatments Etc driving them back did you know that the Rave they call it it was certainly wasn't Godly music these were not religious Jews did you know that that was that was supposed to be a peace promoting event and that there were Israeli Arabs at that event and there were foreign workers from the nations of the world at that event and it was an event that was promoted to promote peace between Arabs and Jews and many of the people who lived in the kabut on the borders were were men and women who had worked closely with Palestinian men and women families for many years and did you know they were so friendly toward the Palestinians that they allowed them to come in the border and work in their homes and in their kabut and trusted them all the while they were learning the layout drawing pictures of their homes showing on a map where the safe rooms were and selling that information to Hamas and I have to listen every day as many of them are called innocent Palestinians knowing that so many of them have sold Secrets can you imagine the ultimate betrayal of serving taking care of a woman's baby helping helping care for a family with small children as a as a a pair or whatever they call them all the while making notes so that enemies can come in and steal those children out of their mother's arms come on now really and I'm not supposed to get emotional or I should shouldn't mention it too much or or I shouldn't light a candle for Hanukkah eight simple little nights to remember the suffering or I shouldn't visit the Holocaust Museum or I shouldn't try to mix Judaism with the message or mix the Old Testament with the New Testament or anything else that you've ever said or heard said about me are you blind are you dumb are you deaf can't you see the spirit that's operating in the world around us on don't you get the connection by now and do you think for one moment that you and I will escape the same kind of attack don't you know that that we are hated it's not a people it's a spirit don't you know Antichrist hates you don't you know the spirit of antichrist would like to destroy you don't you women know the spirit of antichrist would like to see you Bob your hair and paint your face oh yeah oh don't you know that the spirit that presents another gospel another Christ would like to see us all just amalgamate and and and acclimate and mix right in the backslid church world or the Sleep message [Music] world can't so they let them in they let antias in as traitors and he they were the first he murdered no loyalty for he saw there was in it a great deal of gold and and on account of the riches that lay in the temple he wanted in for he saw there was in it a great deal of gold and many ornaments that had been dedicated to it of very great value and in order to plunder its wealth he ventured to break the league he had made so he left the temple bare he took away the golden candlesticks and the golden Altar and table and the Altar and did not abstain from even the the the most holy uh uh vessels and even the veils of linen and Scarlet he stole he also emptied it of the secret treasures and left nothing at all remaining and by this means cast the Jews into great lamentation for he forbade them to offer those daily sacrifices which they used to offer to God according to the law and when he had pillaged the whole city some of the inhabitants he slew and some he carried away captive together with their wives and children so that the multitude of those captives that were taken alive amounted that day to 10,000 he also burnt down the finest buildings and when he had overthrown the city walls he built a citadel in the lower part of the city for the place was high and overlooked the temple on which a county fortified it with high walls and towers and put into it a Garrison of macedonians however in that Citadel dwelt the impious and wicked part of the multitude from whom it proved that the citizen suffered many and sore calamities and when the king had built an altar an idle altar upon God's altar he slew swine upon it offered a sacrifice neither according to the law nor the Jewish religious worship in that country he also compelled them to forsake the worship which they paid to their own God and to adore Those whom he took to be gods and made them build temples and raise Idol altars in every city and V I tell you what he commanded them not to circumcised their sons he threatened punishment that any should be found to have transgressed his injunction he also pointed overseers who should compel them to do what he commanded and indeed many Jews there were also compiled with the king's commands either voluntarily or out of fear the penalty that was denounced but the best men and those of the noblest Souls did not regard him glory there comes a makabe there comes a Judah yes sir there comes a little ragtag family from the village of modin they did not regard him but did pay a greater respect to the customs of their country than concerned as to the punishment which he threatened to the disobedient on which account they every day underwent great miseries and bitter torments for they were whipped with rods their bodies Torn to Pieces they were crucified while they were still alive and breathed they also strangled those women and their sons whom they had circumcised as the king had appointed hanging their sons about their necks as they were upon the crosses and if there were any Sacred Book of the law found it destroyed and those with whom they were found miserably perished also and it goes on this is this is a historical record of what Antiochus did that day but God but God but God Zechariah 9:13 this scripture comes to my mind every time I look at the story and I'm closing for I have bent Judah for myself as my bow fill the bow with Ephraim as my arrow and will stir up your sons o Zion against your sons oh Greece and will make you Israel as the sword of a mighty man Hallelujah you believe the prophet saw it coming you believe zachari who often prophesied about the end of time and things not yet fulfilled do you believe that he knew what he was prophesying here when he said I've tooken Judah for me what Judah mean praise put it back for me would you Judah means praise I've taken Judah for myself as my bow fill the bow with Ephraim as my arrow and will stir up your sons oion brother sister it's time for the sons of Zion to be stirred up we saw one stirred up this morning in his praise I see them every time I gather here together the sons of Zion being stirred up not laying down bowing down to the to the spirit of compromise it started with one priest Mattias or in Hebrew mahu mahu metu it's hard to say the son of John from the village of moden and five Sons the most well known being Judah now as to Judah M known now referred to as Judah mccabes in the temple and altar to Zeus was erected and sacrifices were to be made at the feet of an idol in the image of the king against that desecration these macbes began to rise up Judah became the leader of the anti-greek Jews he led and aroused the hians or hasmoneans as a Guerilla war and several times they defeated the general can you imagine a family and a few called in to help many times defeated the general Antiochus and his generals that he had appointed to deal with the uprising stay with me just a moment but in December of 164 he was able December of 164 he was able to enter the Holy Temple tear down the altar this was macbes Judah in December of 164 he was able to tear down the altar of Zeus and begin to reconsecrate the temple now just to show you by comparison we're talking about a few hundred men gathered under the hasmonean revolt can I tell you what Antiochus had at his command we know because the recorded history tells us that in 166 two years before this he filed a record of his army that had gathered at Daphne near Antioch and this was his possessions 46,000 foot soldiers how do a couple of hundred men overcome 46,000 foot soldiers among them a Macedonian flank of 20,000 men and 500 mercenaries equipped with Roman arms followed by 8,500 men on Mighty war horses and let's not forget last but not least 36 armored elephants and a couple of hundred Jews it's a Miracle of Miracles so the the oil not recorded in any of these records only recorded in from talmudic times so many people believe it's a legend you know what I say it doesn't matter if they didn't find oil and if it didn't miraculously last for eight nights I kind of believe it did cuz that just reminds me of my God but if it didn't we already had a great miracle happen here just a few little Rebels said wait a minute Mr Antiochus wait a minute we're going to stand for the word we're going to stand for the god of Israel so that I don't have to read this this evening would you read for me David I won't preach anymore I'm done preaching would you read 1 mccabes 4: 36- 59 I want you to see the scene then said Judas and his brother Judas is Judah Judah his name was heniz Behold our enemies are discom fitted let us go up to cleanse and dedicate the sanctuary upon this all the hosts assembled themselves together and went up into Mount Zion can you see it can anybody stretch your mind to see it not a well equipped Army not fine armors and fine weapons and beautiful shiny uniforms Jews robes ropes around their waist sandals on their feet and here they go up read it David and when they saw the sanctuary desolate and the Altar profaned and the gates burned and the shrubs growing how would you feel I know how I felt uh what was it brother a year ago or two years ago when someone busted the window here a young man come come here high strung out walking down this highway and he he came there Hawke actually saw him later didn't know that he had damaged the church and took him to his home later we discovered that he was cold and he wanted to get inside and the door was locked of course it was and he went and got a brick from off the pile and burst that window out but never got in but he burst that window out and and glass shattered clean out here into the aisle it was a I think it was it the window where Chad is or Ben is brother gy do you remember where Chad is glass all the way out here in the aisle and we're down on our knees picking up that glass I want you to know something it was just a window before I even noted that window was out and replac and brother gy bought another window to replace it was it was it was nothing but I felt like you would feel if it was done to your home so violated the devil how could the devil get by with coming on to this property and bursting out a window you you know I'm an emotional person it ripped me it angered me it wounded me how would you feel if I come up the hill over there with you David and we found your home burnt ravished stolen and you found out it was only because you went to New hope you didn't wrong anybody steal from anybody cheat anybody but they found out you went to this church so they went up there what if Ashley had been taken the baby in her arms I want you before we go home today ask yourself these questions how would you feel now I want you to see if you can see these little Jews walking up the hill come on like David would walk up the hill like I would walk up up the hill like you would walk up the hill if you'd had enough enough is enough is enough if you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything and they saw the sanctuary desolate pigs Blood on the altar Gates burned up read and the shrubs growing in the quarts as in a forest or in one of the mountains yay and the priest's Chambers pulled down cuz they were pretty busy for three years fighting the enemy now they get around to re re cleaning up things and they rent their clothes and made great lamentation and cast ashes upon their heads and fell down flat on the ground upon their faces and blew an alarm with the trumpets and cried toward heaven then Judah appointed certain men to fight against those that were in The Fortress until he had cleansed the sanctuary still enemies lingering still lingering enemies uh you know hovering over the damage so he chose priest of blameless conversation such as had pleasure in the law who cleansed the sanctuary and bear out the defiled stones into an unclean place and when he and when as they consulted what to do with the altar of burnt offerings which was perined they thought it best to pull it down lest it should be a reproach to them because the Heathen had defiled it wherefore they pulled it down and laid up the stones in the mountain of the temple in a convenient place until there should come a prophet to show what should be done with them and they took whole Stones according to the law and built a new altar according to the former and made up the sanctuary and the things that were within the temple and hollowed the hallowed the courts they made also new holy vessels and into the temple they brought the Candlestick and the altar of burnt offerings and of incense and the table and upon the altar they burned incense and the lamb that were upon the candlesticks they lighted and they that they might have light in the temple furthermore they set the loaves upon the table and spread out the veils and finished all the works which they had began to make now on the five and 20th day of the ninth month which is called the month KES in the 148 year they rose up bed times in the morning times and offered sacrifice according to the law upon the new altar of burnt offerings which they had made look at what time and what day the Heathen had profaned it even in that was it dedicated with songs and sits and harps and symbols symbols drums then all the people fell upon their faces worshiping and praising the god of Heaven who had given them good success and so they kept the dedication of the here is what the word word Hanukah means dedication read and so they kept the dedication of the altar eight days and offered burnt offerings with gladness and sacrificed a sacrifice of Deliverance and praise they decked also the Forefront of the temple with crowns of gold and with shields and the gates and the chambers they renewed and hang doors upon them thus as was there very great gladness among the people for for that the reproach of the Heathen was put away moreover Judah and his Brethren with the whole Congregation of Israel ordained that the days of the dedication of the altar should be kept in their season from year to year by the space of eight days from the 5 and 20th day of the month of Kes Lev with the my and gladness with mirth and gladness it was so holy to them it was so sacred to them to be used by God to haul off the bloody Stones right get with me a moment they didn't even want to clean the stone the stones had been washed with blood and they took the dirty Stones off into the valley and they brought back the things that they could get their hands on to reestablish the order in the temple to worship God and it was so holy to them that they called all the congregation together and said we must celebrate eight days we will celebrate and Let It Be Remembered throughout all generations that for eight days we will remember this day that the altar of God was captured cleansed and rededicated it's a message to us it's a call to us to do the same am he doesn't dwell any longer in a house made with hands he now lives in a house that's made up of lively Living Stones right how many of you one of those houses musicians are coming amen I'm one of those who lives in a house of Living Stones maybe you've got a little blood on your altar maybe you've got a little bit of the world that's spilled over in your life maybe you've become a little hellenized may may maybe maybe even since the word has come you you've become a little denominational lied and you feel a call I feel a call I brought this today because I feel a call I'm only lamenting in the fact that I'm insufficient to be able to deliver it to you in a timely manner where you'd be able to get it I can't even finish what I have prepared and it's on me it's not on you it's a heavy load it's what we have to do it's the reason why we take time every year to remember what happened because we can make it very very personal Lord what's what needs to be recaptured cleansed and res Sanctified in my own life I'll do my best to finish this on Tuesday evening would you stand in Lord here we are in your presence I ask you to forgive me if I have allowed my passion to become anger I confess to you that I take it personal forgive me help me to do it right help me to do a better job at it help me not to deliver it as though I'm angry with anyone let the truth of this message not be lost because of my feeble way of delivery drive it God drive it into somebody's heart in case there should come a day that we would face the same kind of persecution I'd like to think that I would not be one who would quit honoring Sabbath because it was outlawed I'd like to think that I would not be one that shaved my beard because I was confronted to fit in I'd like to think that I would not be one who would stand by and allow the Antichrist Spirit to offer false offerings on the altar of the most high God I'd like to thank Lord that I would have been a one of those macbes and yet sometime fear grips my heart and courage is far from me I don't know for sure exactly what I would have done Lord strengthen us your people we have opportunities now to stand for your word for your truth to love people but not compromise with their sin oh God help us to recapture the temple lies have tried to inhabit the house soldiers have tried to March against the house the spirit of the world has tried to influence the house may we stand today as ser vants of the Lord and Warriors of the faith may we refuse to swallow the compromise of the hour make us passionate for truth I'm tired of defending our worship I'm tired of Defending gifts of the Spirit in this last day I'm tired of defending the fact that we still believe the Holy Ghost is NE necessary to have a service help us Lord rather to turn inward and find the influence of Babylon my God may we find the influence of the Greek mentality may we be stirred like sons of Zion passionate for the word to take worship more serious to take Church attendance more serious to take backing the preaching more serious to take our prayer life more serious we can only cleanse what we recapture we can only rededicate what we cleanse we need your help yes you alone Are Holy in all my good deeds on my best day my righteousness is

touching my house and I'm coming out of here with my sword swinging around my head you better run you devil I'm so thankful for women of God and Men of God who are not afraid to stand for the word and we pray always especially during this time for the Jewish people I've been admonished and rebuked uh several times this week publicly and told that we should not pray for their military success you you do you I'll do me every time Israel didn't obey the Lord and let their enemies live they have continued to deal with the same thing over and over and over and over [Music] again don't let someone

thank you for your attention you know I I can only say uh thank you for your attention if we had a Sunday night service we could have been done hours ago and finished it up tonight but we don't but we do have a gathering if you didn't know about it you're still welcome to attend I feel sure there will be plenty of food we're going to meet in a little while at Philadelphia Baptist Church Fellowship Hall behind the church building go around to the back door where we were where we were last Saturday we're going to come together tonight and if you've got a real problem with what we're celebrating well you stay home the donuts are for me we've never done this before but we're my wife with the help of a few sisters they're going to after we eat our meal they're going to make homemade donuts hot on the scene I can't imagine the task there's 160 Donuts to be cut out in fied I can't imagine but you're going to get to taste the real deal we're going to have a wonderful remember it's solemn when we're preaching this but but but the remembrance of the rededication was to be a happy time celebratory time and it's just so ironic did you see the young man who son-in-law I think I may be wrong who said to his to his mother-in-law I I think maybe the grandmother of his wife I I I'm sorry for the detail slipping me but she wanted something from her home she was displaced and she sent him back and he did not have the heart to tell her that her home that she had built lived in was burned and destroyed knocked over and in the mess he still didn't tell her but he refused to go home without finding something of hers in the rubble and all he could find was dust and broken rock and concrete and twisted rebar he kept staying and kept lingering and kept digging on his hands and knees and all he could find was to hukum two minoras that are used at Hanukkah time one was badly twisted and he brought those to her not yet telling her everything else was destroyed and they lit those lamps and when I saw the picture of that lamp being lit those candles being lit I said this is why I observe this is why because the spirit of God's people cannot be broken for long we because we're grafted in we carry the same resilience to keep on keeping on the devil may knock us down but we get right up and keep on keeping on no I'm not going to hold you any longer father thank you for our time together may we long remember what you have spoken to us may we long remember what you have spoken to us we'll give you praise and honor and Glory for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said amen where's my wife I saw her a minute ago she's oh you're running the sound now it is uh 3:00 2 minutes till 3 5:30 they want to do they want to just make the tables nice but uh I'm going to have to have a turkey sandwich before night time before we get over there but about 5:30 if you happen to be there a little early you could probably jump in and help but could we plan to eat at 5:30 I know that's odd the way we're doing it but that's because the food is is going to be hot that way and if you want to stick around in Fellowship then you know in the vestibule or whatever I'm sure there'll be somebody with a that can help close up or stop back by or do something to make sure we get closed up let's come tonight uh let's light the hanuk and let's uh let's remember the grace of God over a little family that said we won't just watch the enemy take everything that belongs to us and really I see a lot of mcabees here today I do thank God for you God bless you you're dismissed to go in the name of the Lord if we could go home and not do a lot of fellowshipping now we could have three or four hours to Fellowship together this evening uh at the fellowship hall don't run out on us and not help clean if we're going to do a community thing it takes the whole Community to make it special make it work we'll see you at the fellowship hall of the Philadelphia Baptist Church God bless you as you go Lord I worship you I worship you Lord I work
