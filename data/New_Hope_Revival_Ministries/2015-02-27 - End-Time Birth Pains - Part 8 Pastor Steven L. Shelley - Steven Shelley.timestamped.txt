[0:51] hello i'm pastor steven shelley and
[0:53] you're watching the eagles cry i want to
[0:56] welcome you to the broadcast today we've
[0:58] been studying for several weeks now the
[1:02] birth pangs of the messiah matthew
[1:04] chapter 24 verse 8 where the lord jesus
[1:07] tells us that all these things are the
[1:10] beginning of sorrows or the beginning of
[1:13] the labor pains the the pains of travail
[1:17] and we see these things happening in the
[1:20] world and it's easy to get discouraged
[1:22] when we look out at the condition of the
[1:25] world and the darkness that surrounds us
[1:27] but this is not a time for the bride of
[1:30] christ to be discouraged or defeated in
[1:34] fact it's a time for us to cling to him
[1:37] like we've never clinged to him before
[1:39] hold on to him refuse to turn him loose
[1:43] i know that he'll carry us safely
[1:45] through whatever happens in this world
[1:48] i'm sure of that
[1:50] i want to thank you for contacting our
[1:52] ministry new hope revival ministries in

[2:28] website check out some of our resources
[2:31] and as i said send your prayer requests
[2:34] because we want to join with you in
[2:36] prayer i tell you i i still believe that
[2:39] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[2:41] righteous man availeth much i believe
[2:44] when two or three agree together as
[2:46] touching any one thing we have a promise
[2:48] that it will be given to us of our
[2:50] father we're not praying selfish prayers
[2:53] in this hour to uh to try to prosper in
[2:56] our own in our own plans and plots but
[2:59] we are praying
[3:01] prayers of faith believing for healing
[3:04] believing for provision believing for
[3:07] salvation and deliverance whatever we
[3:10] have need of in this hour i believe our
[3:13] father owns the cattle of a thousand
[3:15] hills i believe that he is the source
[3:18] instead of using the lord as our last
[3:21] reso resort i guess i should say
[3:24] we should come to him as our first
[3:27] resource
[3:28] because he has everything that we have
[3:31] need of in this hour
[3:33] we want to we want to uh
[3:36] sort of begin to draw our study to a
[3:38] close on the birth pangs of messiah as i
[3:42] mentioned a little bit earlier we've
[3:44] been doing a countdown counting backward
[3:48] the ten
[3:49] most important uh events signs birth
[3:53] pains of the coming of the lord we see
[3:57] these things all of these things growing
[4:00] in
[4:01] uh frequency and intensity as we get
[4:05] closer to his coming i want to just go
[4:08] over those those 10 things with you
[4:11] again because today we're going to talk
[4:13] about the number one sign
[4:16] of the nearness of the coming of the
[4:18] lord before we do i want to re-mention
[4:21] all of the others number 10 signs in the
[4:25] sun moon and stars
[4:27] scripture you can look at is luke 21 25
[4:32] number nine violence upon the whole
[4:34] earth
[4:35] luke 17 26 and genesis 6 11.
[4:40] number eight famines pestilences and
[4:42] earthquakes matthew 24 verse 7 luke 21
[4:47] verse 11. i wish we had time to re uh
[4:51] re-look at all of these but we've
[4:53] covered them well and you can find a way
[4:57] to access the other episodes on our
[4:59] website at revival.org number seven
[5:03] nations in distress with perplexity just
[5:06] people out of their heads with confusion
[5:09] about what's going on in the nations of
[5:11] the world number six false prophets and
[5:14] false teachers and there's certainly
[5:17] been an increase of that number five an
[5:20] increase of technology in the end time
[5:23] as prophesied by daniel in daniel
[5:26] chapter 12 and verse 4.
[5:29] number four
[5:30] nations aligning for prophetic
[5:33] fulfillment in psalm chapter 2
[5:36] verse 1 and 3 one of the scriptures that
[5:39] we can look at you could look at
[5:40] revelation 9 verse 16. you could look at
[5:44] daniel chapter 2.
[5:46] uh there there are many other places
[5:48] ezekiel 38 39 etc
[5:51] and then the third is apostasy a the
[5:54] formation of a one world church look at
[5:58] revelation chapter 13 all the way
[6:01] through chapter 17 for more information
[6:04] about that number two the forming of a
[6:07] one-world government
[6:08] and a one-world economy which would
[6:11] include a one-world monetary system you
[6:13] say well that's not a reality today no
[6:15] it's not a reality as of yet but
[6:18] tremendous strides uh unbelievable steps
[6:22] are being taken right now to to bring us
[6:25] into that kind of a situation and then
[6:28] what we have to be concerned about is
[6:30] that one world government forming
[6:33] together coming together merging with
[6:35] that one world religious system because
[6:38] when you put the religious system and
[6:40] the political system together you're
[6:42] covering all your bases and that's when
[6:44] the antichrist is going to have full
[6:46] full power to do whatever he wants to do
[6:49] on the earth um i'm sure there are going
[6:52] to be limitations on that scriptural
[6:54] limitations and and and god is still god
[6:58] don't forget that but there's going to
[7:00] be a lot of serious things happening on
[7:03] this planet during the great wrath i
[7:05] believe that god is
[7:07] protecting his people in this hour he's
[7:10] going to see us through and i am one of
[7:12] those old-fashioned preachers that still
[7:15] believes in a resurrection rapture i
[7:17] just don't believe that resurrection
[7:19] rapture will take us out of here before
[7:22] there's going to be some pretty serious
[7:24] things happen on the earth they're
[7:26] happening now and again i want to
[7:29] continue to stress the fact that these
[7:32] birth pains these signs of the coming of
[7:35] the lord are increasing in frequency and
[7:39] in intensity
[7:41] we come now to the most important number
[7:45] one sign
[7:47] birth pain
[7:48] that helps us to know that we are
[7:51] nearing the coming of the lord and that
[7:54] number one sign is the nation of israel
[8:00] we
[8:01] we recognize and the church has
[8:04] recognized for years that israel is like
[8:08] the time peace of god
[8:10] specifically the city of jerusalem the
[8:13] prophets tell us throughout the
[8:15] scripture to watch jerusalem keep our
[8:19] eyes on israel and we will
[8:22] know the mind of god the mind of god
[8:25] will be revealed to us by watching the
[8:27] nation of israel
[8:29] the prophet zachariah one of my favorite
[8:32] prophets of the older covenant
[8:34] certainly gives us some indication of
[8:37] what things are going to look like in
[8:39] the end time concerning israel before we
[8:42] look at zechariah 12 let's mention first
[8:46] the miracle
[8:47] that there is a nation of israel
[8:51] let's think about the fact that a nation
[8:54] was born in a day
[8:56] fulfilling the words of the prophets of
[8:59] the old testament
[9:01] a nation was truly born in a day
[9:05] the jewish people were restored to their
[9:07] homeland now it hasn't been an easy
[9:10] process by any means
[9:13] there are many many nations many groups
[9:16] of people that would like to see israel
[9:18] and the jewish people driven into the
[9:21] sea in complete devastation and in utter
[9:24] announcement but i want you to know that
[9:27] the god of eternity has made an eternal
[9:30] covenant with the jewish people in the
[9:32] nation of israel it was god it wasn't
[9:35] the un it wasn't the president of the
[9:37] united states it wasn't the prime
[9:39] minister of of the united kingdom that
[9:42] established the nation of israel it was
[9:44] god who did it
[9:46] it was god's supernatural power that
[9:49] provided away
[9:50] after the scattering of the jewish
[9:52] people after the horrors of the
[9:54] holocaust
[9:56] god allowed his people to go home and
[9:58] what they found was a barren wasteland a
[10:02] desert
[10:03] with very little vegetation and very
[10:06] little hope for a future but god blessed
[10:08] those resilient jewish pioneers
[10:12] they hacked out a life
[10:15] in that desert land and now the
[10:17] scriptures have been fulfilled the
[10:20] nation the desert is blooming like a
[10:23] rose i've spent a tremendous amount of
[10:26] time in the past 10 years in the nation
[10:28] of israel and i love being there because
[10:32] every day before me i see prophecy
[10:35] fulfilled
[10:36] i've eaten the fruits of canaan i've
[10:39] tasted them with my own lips i know that
[10:42] god's word is true i've seen the desert
[10:45] blossom like a rose
[10:47] i know that modern the modern state of
[10:50] israel is a miracle and it is a
[10:54] prophetic sign that we're nearing the
[10:57] coming of the lord but zachariah begins
[11:00] to tell us what it's really going to
[11:02] look like
[11:03] at that time and let's look at zechariah
[11:05] chapter 12
[11:07] we can look at the first few verses to
[11:10] get a pretty good picture
[11:12] the burden of the word of the lord for
[11:14] israel saith the lord which stretcheth
[11:17] forth the heavens and layeth the
[11:20] foundations of the earth
[11:22] and formeth the spirit of man within him
[11:26] behold i will make jerusalem a cup of
[11:30] trembling unto all the people round
[11:33] about when they shall be in the siege
[11:36] both against judah and against jerusalem
[11:39] and in that day will i make jerusalem
[11:42] a burdensome stone for all people
[11:46] all that burdened themselves with it
[11:48] shall be cut in pieces though all the
[11:51] people of the earth be gathered together
[11:54] against it i want you to know there's
[11:56] never been a time
[11:59] like this hour where we can see
[12:02] the beginning of the fulfillment of this
[12:04] prophecy of zachariah where all nations
[12:08] are coming against the nation of israel
[12:10] in one form or another
[12:13] uh it it can be as simple as calling for
[12:16] a boycott on all israeli uh imports
[12:20] uh into into particular nations i mean
[12:23] come on
[12:24] what's wrong with the nation that would
[12:27] refuse a shipment of hand lotion because
[12:31] it was made at the dead sea coming from
[12:33] the nation of israel something is
[12:35] seriously wrong there is a
[12:39] uh a prejudice and a jealousy against
[12:42] the nation of israel like we've never
[12:45] seen before
[12:46] and it can can start off that simple as
[12:50] boycott of products and it goes
[12:52] to the threats that are that are hurled
[12:55] every day in the media we want to see
[12:58] the jewish people driven into the sea we
[13:01] want to see the nation of israel so it's
[13:03] never going to stop with a two-state
[13:06] solution it's never going to stop with a
[13:09] road map for peace
[13:11] come on
[13:13] the scripture tells us that it's going
[13:15] to intensify not get better
[13:18] it's going to intensify until all
[13:22] nations
[13:23] form against israel
[13:26] against jerusalem zachariah has
[13:29] prophesied it and i tell you it's not a
[13:31] good idea so even though i know the
[13:34] scripture says it's coming i pray
[13:36] against it every day i pray that that
[13:39] america will not make that fatal mistake
[13:43] i pray for other nations that they will
[13:45] not make that fatal mistake but
[13:47] ultimately there is coming a time
[13:50] perhaps prayer is holding it back for
[13:53] now but there is coming a time
[13:56] when these verses of scripture will be
[13:58] reality
[14:00] and and let's not forget the rest of the
[14:03] story let's read down a little bit more
[14:06] let's look at verse 7 for instance in
[14:09] zechariah 12. the lord also shall save
[14:12] the tents of judah first
[14:15] that the glory of the house of david and
[14:18] the glory of the inhabitants of
[14:20] jerusalem do not magnify themselves
[14:23] against judah
[14:25] in that day verse 8 here it goes hold on
[14:29] verse 8 in that day shall the lord
[14:32] the lord adonai
[14:35] defend the inhabitants of jerusalem
[14:39] and he that is feeble among them
[14:42] at that day shall be as david
[14:46] and the house of david shall be as god
[14:50] as the angel of the lord before them and
[14:53] it shall come to pass in that day
[14:56] that i will seek to destroy
[14:59] all nations that come against jerusalem
[15:03] period final
[15:06] no room for discussion
[15:08] no room for uh
[15:10] compromise in this at all
[15:13] i will pour out upon the house of david
[15:16] and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem
[15:19] the spirit of grace and of supplication
[15:22] and they shall look upon me whom they
[15:25] have pierced and they shall mourn for
[15:28] him as one mourneth for his only son and
[15:32] shall be in bitterness for him as one
[15:35] that is in bitterness for his son in
[15:37] that day shall there be a great morning
[15:39] in jerusalem now this is uh talking
[15:43] about the recognition of the rejection
[15:46] of yeshua the lord jesus as the messiah
[15:50] this has not happened yet this is how we
[15:53] know that these scriptures have not been
[15:55] fulfilled yet because there has not been
[15:58] a repentance
[16:00] uh corporately
[16:02] for the rejection of yeshua as the
[16:05] messiah but god has not forgotten his
[16:08] covenant with the jewish people
[16:10] i've had the blessing of sending this
[16:12] eagles cry broadcast at different times
[16:16] over the past few years right into the
[16:18] nation of israel and we have seen god
[16:20] use it in a in a a wonderful way
[16:24] for for both a jew and for arab i've had
[16:28] contact from
[16:30] people living in ramallah as well as
[16:33] contact from jewish people
[16:35] living in in jerusalem and in some of
[16:38] the surrounding areas
[16:40] and i can't tell you how much i love
[16:43] all of the people who live in israel i
[16:46] want to see god send a revival to the
[16:50] arab nations of the world to the
[16:52] palestinian people i want to see god
[16:55] bring deliverance and hope and salvation
[16:58] please don't misunderstand or or judge
[17:02] what i'm saying as being prejudiced
[17:04] however i have a moral obligation and a
[17:08] spiritual
[17:10] responsibility to say what god said and
[17:13] god said i will destroy every nation
[17:17] that rises against jerusalem now i
[17:20] believe the jewish people have
[17:22] an unfailing right to the city of
[17:25] jerusalem i didn't say the christians i
[17:28] said the jewish people god didn't give
[17:31] the land of israel to the christian
[17:33] people he gave it to the jewish people
[17:36] if they're good enough to share it with
[17:38] the christian people then i think that's
[17:40] amazing but i want you to know that i
[17:43] have to say what god's word said and
[17:46] what is going on right now
[17:49] helps us we're not just talking about
[17:51] intifada we're talking about something
[17:53] bigger than that we're talking about a
[17:55] conspiracy in the league of nations
[17:58] against
[17:59] the nation of israel it seems that every
[18:01] other nation in the world is allowed
[18:04] without criticism to defend their own
[18:07] people and the rights to their land but
[18:09] if israel does the same things that
[18:12] other nations do she is emphatically
[18:16] condemned this is so unfair
[18:19] and to to speak against the jewish right
[18:23] to the land of israel is to speak
[18:25] against the scripture and the god of
[18:28] scripture so we better be careful how we
[18:30] do that
[18:32] i love some of the verses of scripture
[18:34] that talk about how what's going to
[18:36] unfold in the land of israel and the
[18:38] bible some of it can be very very
[18:41] serious
[18:43] remember that
[18:45] that one of the things that they're
[18:46] talking about now when they're
[18:48] condemning israel is we have to do this
[18:50] for the sake of peace we want peace
[18:53] peace peace well let me remind you what
[18:55] the bible said in the new testament in 1
[18:57] thessalonians chapter 5 verse 3 for when
[19:00] they shall say peace and safety then
[19:03] sudden destruction cometh upon them as
[19:06] travail upon a woman with child and they
[19:09] shall not escape so all of the road map
[19:12] for peace and the idea that that we're
[19:15] going to compromise for uh give land for
[19:17] peace and all of this kind of stuff
[19:19] that's going on right now that just
[19:21] enrages the nations and uh and and the
[19:25] allies of israel they want to say we can
[19:28] sort this out we can settle it well the
[19:30] bible said we won't be able to sort it
[19:32] out it's a bigger a bigger issue than
[19:34] what we realize it's a not just a
[19:36] political issue or an ethnic issue or a
[19:40] religious issue
[19:42] this is a god issue
[19:44] and
[19:45] what we see going on i guess what i what
[19:48] i need to summarize and say here is what
[19:50] we see going on with israel with the
[19:53] jewish people and with the nations that
[19:55] hate her is nothing in the world but the
[19:57] fulfillment of multiple prophetic
[20:01] scriptures in the bible it lets us know
[20:04] that we are getting closer and closer
[20:08] and closer to the coming of the lord uh
[20:11] the antichrist is going to to do some uh
[20:15] things he's going to have some influence
[20:17] even in
[20:18] uh in that nation in the nation of
[20:20] israel we we see that some things are
[20:22] going to unfold there but god ultimately
[20:26] is going to reveal himself to the jewish
[20:28] people and i believe what the scripture
[20:30] said don't let it be misunderstood the
[20:33] bible said all israel will be saved
[20:38] they're going to recognize according to
[20:40] daniel 12 they're going to recognize
[20:43] the scars in his hands
[20:45] they're going to mourn for him as as
[20:48] their own son
[20:50] read zechariah chapter 13 and zechariah
[20:53] chapter 14 as well to get a fuller
[20:55] picture
[20:57] of why we believe
[20:59] that the things that are happening
[21:01] around
[21:02] israel now are pointing us to the soon
[21:05] coming of the lord but before we go
[21:08] today let's look at daniel chapter 8
[21:10] verse 25
[21:12] speaking about this wicked one this man
[21:15] of sin it says and through his policy
[21:18] also
[21:19] he shall cause craft to prosper in his
[21:22] hand and he shall magnify himself in his
[21:26] heart and by peace shall destroy many he
[21:30] shall also stand up against the prince
[21:33] of princes
[21:35] but he shall be broken without hand
[21:39] so
[21:40] we have some clear
[21:43] insight toward
[21:45] a final battle that's going to take
[21:47] place the forces of god are good and the
[21:51] forces of evil
[21:52] god's going to win the scripture is
[21:54] going to prevail
[21:56] the truth of god's word
[21:58] cannot it just doesn't lie and and it
[22:01] cannot fail and we can count on that uh
[22:05] we need to pray for the nation of israel
[22:08] uh we
[22:09] who know who the messiah is we who have
[22:12] hope in yeshua the lord jesus christ we
[22:16] have a responsibility and a privilege to
[22:19] pray for the jewish people
[22:21] and pray for the nation of israel the
[22:23] bible tells us if those who pray for
[22:26] israel those who who speak on her behalf
[22:29] those who stand up for her they're going
[22:31] to prosper
[22:32] if if your nation wants to survive
[22:36] in the end time there's a dividing
[22:38] taking place between sheep nations and
[22:40] goat nations and i believe that's
[22:43] determined by
[22:44] how a nation chooses to stand in
[22:48] agreement in covenant with what god has
[22:50] said concerning israel and the jewish
[22:53] people i do not believe in replacement
[22:56] theology let me slide that in here for
[22:58] the record
[22:59] i've spoken to you about it before that
[23:02] the church has replaced israel that the
[23:05] christian church has taken the place
[23:08] of of natural israel because
[23:12] of the rejection of the messiah again do
[23:15] you think that caught god by surprise
[23:18] are you trying to tell me that god
[23:20] didn't know what israel was going to do
[23:24] how she would not recognize for the most
[23:26] part who the messiah was
[23:29] that's not the god i serve
[23:31] nothing catches him by surprise he knew
[23:34] exactly how it was going to be in fact
[23:37] the scripture said according to the
[23:39] apostle paul
[23:40] he he
[23:42] blinded their eyes to prevent them from
[23:45] being able to see
[23:48] harden their heart according to romans
[23:50] chapter 11
[23:52] so that you and i
[23:54] could have an opportunity so that all
[23:56] people would have an opportunity to see
[23:59] the messiah and to be grafted in god
[24:01] always had a plan all throughout the
[24:04] scripture for not only the household of
[24:06] israel but for the stranger among them
[24:09] you don't have to feel like a
[24:10] second-class citizen if you don't have
[24:12] natural jewish lineage because god has
[24:15] made provision
[24:17] the problem is the church has persecuted
[24:20] the jewish people down through the ages
[24:22] in the name of religion
[24:25] and uh the the prejudice and the hatred
[24:29] uh against the jewish people it it's
[24:31] it's
[24:32] it's heartbreaking if you do any
[24:34] research it's heartbreaking
[24:37] uh even the wicked heart of hitler was
[24:40] some of his ideas were rooted and and in
[24:44] in
[24:45] in the tenets of the christian faith
[24:47] what he had read from from leaders
[24:51] and and so uh i think we owe a debt
[24:54] uh the church at large owes a debt to
[24:57] the jewish people the way we can we can
[24:59] help repay that debt is to pray for the
[25:02] peace of jerusalem to pray for the
[25:05] nation of israel to stand with her if
[25:08] you can do anything to support her and
[25:11] help her
[25:12] then i think god is well pleased when we
[25:15] make that commitment
[25:17] so
[25:18] the miracle of the modern state of
[25:20] israel
[25:21] started i think it started a time period
[25:24] of the end
[25:25] i think we can say that when when israel
[25:28] uh formed as a nation again and the and
[25:32] the magan david the star of david flew
[25:35] again over the city of jerusalem i think
[25:37] we can say that the end times
[25:40] that that final end times scenario
[25:44] started unfolding
[25:46] and here we are today
[25:48] some 60 years later
[25:50] and i believe we can see with what's
[25:53] happening around the world concerning
[25:55] this miracle of israel helps us to know
[25:59] that we are
[26:00] swiftly approaching the consummation of
[26:03] the ages the end of all things the
[26:06] second coming of the messiah the lord
[26:08] jesus christ if you don't know him and
[26:11] the power of his resurrection if you've
[26:14] never tasted the sweet
[26:16] sweetness
[26:18] of his salvation come to him today
[26:20] repent of your your sins acknowledge
[26:24] that he is the savior he has paid the
[26:26] price for your salvation and your
[26:28] redemption invite him into your life if
[26:32] you are a believer and you are have
[26:34] grown cold in your spiritual walk i pray
[26:37] that god will set you on fire that your
[26:40] life will be
[26:41] radically stirred up again
[26:44] that you will seek
[26:46] revelation that only comes by the holy
[26:48] spirit from the word of god remember
[26:51] every revelation
[26:53] even dreams or visions or prophecies
[26:56] all of that has to be taken back to the
[26:59] absolute of the word of god to be judged
[27:03] we can't build our faith on something
[27:06] that is not scriptural
[27:08] everything has to come back and line up
[27:10] with the word of god i want to pray for
