Description:
Join us in this powerful message from Pastor Steven L. Shelley as he calls for a stand against fear and cowardice. In a world where the spirit of timidity seeks to dominate, Pastor Shelley urges believers to break free from the chains of fear and embrace the courage and boldness that comes from the Lord.

Key Points:
Rise Above Fear: Pastor Shelley emphasizes the need to stand up and declare an end to the lies and manipulations of the adversary.
Unity Over Division: Drawing inspiration from Chief Joseph's words, he highlights the dangers of internal conflict that weaken us against our true enemies.
The Counterfeit Lion: Understand how the devil uses intimidation and coercion to control and subdue, but remember, we serve the true Lion of Judah.
Focus on Victory: Shift your focus from the problems to the Problem-Solver, from the giant to the Giant-Killer, ensuring that our faith is not in our fears but in our God.

This sermon is a wake-up call for all believers to unite, resist intimidation, and claim the victory that is rightfully ours in Christ.
