microphone but it's one of those sweaty mornings and when my when i swept from the top of my head that microphone shifts and moves and carries around and on and we dry it off and and it gets wet again so anyway that's why i'm pulling in on it because it feels like it's going to fall off if it does we'll just put it back on right isn't it wonderful to be in the house of the lord is anybody glad to see sister flo in the house of the lord this morning hey man [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] i heard through a little bird last night that she was going to try to be here this morning and so we prayed before i went to bed last night prayed that god would make a way and give her the strength to be here and benjamin didn't he didn't know anything about that conversation at all didn't know about the text didn't know i was praying and he was getting dressed this morning he came walking into the dining room where i was studying and he said now i want to know when sister flo is going to be back to church he said i miss her and i want her to be back and i said well pray because she's supposed to be back today and we're glad very very glad that you are all of us have missed you we've been missing brother skip and we're very glad that he's with us at home this morning where he belongs to be there's a few birthdays this week let me call them quickly one is on tuesday sister elfrida's sister sister adina has a birthday on tuesday february the 15th so through the streaming we send a very happy birthday to sister adina and we love them very much and we are so happy that they are able to be connected with us this way on wednesday of this week brother steve curry has a birthday and we want to hold him up to the lord in prayer and ask god for a great touch of his hand god doesn't have to wait till his birthday to give it to him he needs it now and i believe that the lord is able tuesday night as i was going home he sent a text and wanted me to know how much he loved me and i appreciated that very very much i appreciate his thoughtfulness and i thank god for giving him the strength to be able to text himself and the last contact i had was his phone call to me and i saw his name but i expected it to be sister anita but it was brother steve calling he stands in need of prayer on thursday of this week levi has a birthday what number is this for you 19. wow that happened pretty quick i remember when mama was 19 and now you're 19 and then on your birthday same day thursday brother steve and sister anita curry have a wedding anniversary so this is a busy week of celebrating as much as they can and we're going to believe the lord and i couldn't help but notice that this friday would have been sister heice's birthday i don't believe that there are birthdays in heaven i don't i just don't think i just don't think that it's really that big of a to do i think there's so much more to be enjoying i think every day just think of the best birthday you ever had on the earth the best one and multiply that ten thousand times ten thousand that's what you're going to have every day in the presence of the lord i believe that but i couldn't help but notice that it was sister heisie's birthday on friday and we miss her and we think about her often and we pray for her family and we miss brother heichi as well they're in the presence of the lord waiting on us they're just waiting on us i saw where a friend of mine a holiness girl from oklahoma married to a holiness preacher her dad was my very good friend brother milton luke and i saw where this is the anniversary of his death and uh he passed away many years ago now preaching over here at a church in auburn he was from fredonia and he was pastoring a church but he was down preaching for a friend in in opelika auburn and finished his sermon and the lord called him home and when i saw that post of course it made me think about him and i got real excited just real excited because i know that it won't be that much longer and i'll see him again just think about that our loved ones who have died in the lord we're going to see them again and as i said last week there will be nothing between us no awkwardness there'll be nothing no bad memories it'll just be as god intended it to be in the beginning just perfection how many of you are looking forward to that well i certainly am and uh we want to give you the word we want to preach i sort of said we want to preach this morning i do because i believe the lord has laid something on my heart and i want to lay it on your heart so that you can carry it now it's your turn to carry it so let's stand again if you will let me thank god for all of these streamers wherever they're from we see some in the netherlands and indiana and zambia and uh so many more don't worry that's no problem it happens this is the life that we live these days we keep our somebody's checking on us right and uh it's usually the seniors that leave it on but that doesn't mean i couldn't do the same and doesn't mean anybody any of us couldn't but we're just glad that loved ones can get a hold of them when they need them right all of you that are streaming no matter where you're watching god bless you everyone i had an email yesterday from brother george and sister veronique and i might read it it's not long and i know you're standing but you're going to be sitting a while they told me if i wanted to share any of the uh first part of it i could let's see if i can can find it fast enough dear pastor shelley greetings to you your family and all our friends at new hope it has been a while since we met the last year we came over was if i remember well 2008 that's a long time ago for our feelings too long ago we miss you all very much we hope and i love the way they use y'all we taught them something didn't we we miss you all very much we hope and pray that the lord will make a way for us to come over once again but of course in his will and time wouldn't that be wonderful to have them with us again speaking of time a lot of things have happened in the past years since 2009 after my dad passed away we have been serving the lord for some years at an evangelical pentecostal church in uh in the hague during that period the lord blessed us in 2011 with a second daughter sharon rose some of you may not have known that they now have the second daughter and she's just as beautiful as natanya in 2015 it was a shock when i had a heart attack and needed five bypasses but the lord is good all the time and after less than nine months i was fully recovered and since then i work full time again and do all the things i want and sometimes have to do five years ago we had the possibility to move from the hot the hague to a very small village and buy a beautiful old house since then we've been searching for a nice church to go to but as you know it's tough for an eagle to live in a barn the cry of the mother eagle pulls us again and again we learn so much from you your teaching of course but for us also the sweet love that we still experience from y'all we're so blessed to have the opportunity to attend the services every week it is a real blessing to us we love and miss you all george veronique natanya and sharon rose let's send our love back to them in the netherlands god bless you so much yes there are temporary fixes for us along the way there's a slice when we can't have a loaf but it'll never satisfy try it you try it it'll never satisfy like the word of the hour that was god's intention he did it that way for you and i are you here this morning psalm 95 verse 1 and 2. we're going to read a few of the psalms this morning i need your help we want to thank god for these musicians i don't think i'll sing we've been singing a lot come on let's let's make sure they know how much we appreciate them [Music] they don't draw a paycheck all they get is to help enjoy the atmosphere that they create and uh your thanks goes a long way i know to encourage them to make that sacrifice of being here an hour before the service and and playing sometime when they'd like to be down worshiping with you we love them and appreciate them oh come let us sing unto the lord let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation let us come before his presence with thanksgiving and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms with songs oh come let us sing unto the lord let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation i don't know what you think about when you think about noise but i think of something that has some volume to it so don't criticize us if we get a little loud eternity is going to be louder than this whichever place you end up psalm 98 but i believe you're you're going with me and i'm going to uh to a happy place for sure but i my old granny used to say this earth is the quietest place you'll ever live psalm 98 verses 4 through 8 says something quite similar make a joyful noise unto the lord all the earth make a loud noise and rejoice and sing praise hallelujah sing unto the lord with the harp with the harp and the voice of a psalm with trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the lord the king i don't know if you know anything about a trumpet but it is a job to make that trumpet uh volume be low it takes a muffle and it takes some work because when you blow a trumpet i'm telling you it's a loud instrument let the sea roar and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein let the floods clap their hands let the heels be joyful together psalm 100 verse 1 through 5 says something quite similar make a joyful noise unto the lord all ye lands serve the lord with gladness come before his presence with singing sometimes people say oh they sure do sing a lot we're just obeying the word know ye that the lord he is god it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pasture isn't that good to know enter don't wait till the music gets you worked up enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the lord is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations psalm 105 verse 43 i know you're still standing and he brought forth his people and he brought forth his people with joy psalm 105 verse 43. he brought forth his people with joy and his chosen with gladness one more before you're seated psalm 63 5 my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips there's a lot of things that come out of our lips that are not joyful what a great grand privilege to be able to offer god praise with lips that are filled with joy did you know your lips can have joy joyful lips that word is mana and it means ringing out a cry or a shout for joy so it is a it it really means shouting lips lips that shout with joy and shouting is not always quiet sometimes the shout of the king gets to moving in our midst and we are not ashamed to be a little louder than we would know it's not a funeral i streamed just a little bit of sister mother hayton's funeral yesterday she was a dear saint of god brother and sister greeley were there at that funeral and i was able to stream a little of it and i i knew that family for 30 years and i saw them the last time at sister carol kinser's funeral and sister hayden or she must have been about 87 or 88 but i want you to know that wasn't a very quiet funeral there was some real praising the lord there because somebody must have caught in their mind an image of her entering into that rest that she'd been working toward seeing her husband and the saints of god gathered around waiting on her arrival and that would make anybody want to be a little loud wouldn't it let's bow our heads for a moment of prayer father we cannot express enough how how much we love you how thankful we are that you love us i want to thank you for help and strength to get to the house of god today to praise you i'm like everybody else here we have our own aches and pains and we have our own symptoms that nag but i am so thankful to be able to lift up my hands and give you glory and honor and praise i'm not ashamed to praise you in this house and i'm not ashamed for that praise to go all over the world by the internet because we're here on business for the king today and we make no apology for entering into that presence for in your presence o god there is fullness of joy our joy has been made full today because you have honored us you've graced us with your tangible presence and we want to give you praise and honor and glory for it bless our time in the word give us hearts to hear help your servant to deliver and we'll give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray and the saints said you may be seated god bless you god bless brother greeley today preaching for brother darren kinser this morning preaching this evening for brother david farmer before they head home tomorrow may god just give them glorious services that's been our prayer so i want to preach on joy we started last week about from hebrews thinking about the joy that caused our lord to go all the way through he didn't fail us because he caught a glimpse of you and i in his image changed by the power of redemption and so he endured the cross holding on even though he despised the shame involved that joy of seeing you and i in his likeness overcoming in the last age it gave him strength that he needed to go all the way on our behalf today i if i were to title what i want to share i would call it choosing joy as a strategic position joy is a choice and joy is a strategy and joy is a strategic position joy is not based on condition it's based on position it's a placing we are placed as sons we can be placed in joy we can choose to remain in the place of joy no matter what is happening around us now don't tell me that nobody knows what you're going through because somebody somewhere has walked a similar road and if they overcame they overcame by choosing joy they overcame by maintaining a testimony in the midst of a lot of heartache and a lot of hurt and a lot of suffering and some hard trials and some hot flames but they made it through by the grace of god because somebody always will when it looks like remember i used to preach this message around when i traveled when it looked like nobody would somebody did and somebody always will in the book of job it was only one survivor to come and tell the story but no matter how bad the storm was no matter how bad the plague was no matter how many died god always made sure that somebody came through it as an overcomer as a survivor to be able to testify what they had walked through and you and i are those survivors we are those overcomers who will have a testimony unlike any from any other age because we were chosen to live in the last of the last days we were placed here in god's mind it was not a mistake he could have sown you into any generation into any church age but he chose for you to be born in laodicea and he chose for you to hear the last message that god was going to send to prepare an overcoming bride he let you have ears to hear and eyes to see that is the goodness of god look around you and you will recognize that you are a minority in this world you are a minority but as the old song said god one man and god one man and god can try him for a thousand come on one man and god put satan on the run so take courage weary pilgrim one man and god can win the victory and i believe it what is joy well mr webster says that joy is the emotion evoked by well-being by success or good fortune or by the prospect of possessing what one desires that definition for me leaves something lacking because i don't believe that joy is based on success i don't believe that joy is based on good fortune i don't believe that joy is based on the prospect of possessing what you desire i think there's a whole lot more to joy than that don't you to the people who know jesus to those who are true believers these definitions might might be to those who don't know the lord those definitions might be true but to the true christian something different applies as it relates to joy you've heard of wikipedia haven't you it's not the most reliable source of research on the internet because anybody can alter it and change it and doctor it and fix it it's a conglomeration of of contributors well theology has one i don't know if you knew that or not it's called fieldpedia and does a little bit better in describing joy it more convincingly says that it's a state of mind it's an orientation of the heart position it's turning your heart in a right direction not based on success or prosperity but based on what you know what you know that you know that you know that you know that you know joy is not about what you think it's not about how you feel joy is about what you know that you know that you know that you know can you say amen it's a settle state of contentment confidence and hope it is something or someone that provides a source of happiness joy is a strong feeling of happiness a manifestation of happiness through an outward rejoicing or excitement one contributor said joy is not joy unless it's expressed you can be happy have you ever have you ever met somebody who everything was going all right and they still look like they've been sucking on a sour lemon have you ever wanted to say to somebody would you just notify your face i've had people look with us i'm not going to call names but i wouldn't have to throw very far to hit some of you i'm happy brother shelly i'm i'm just as happy as i can be sometimes they they ought to sing to them the old sunday school song you ought to stay with me if you can't help me in the beginning don't help me at the end i need you now you got something more interesting to read there just go right ahead but don't you get happy at the end that's how i feel sometime have you ever just wanted to sing somebody the little children song if you're happy and you know it clap your hands stomp your feet notify your face come on i said one contributor said that joy is not really joy unless you find a way to let it out unless you find a way to express it and i i believe that i i believe that that a great portion of joy is in the ability to express that contentment that god that deep knowing that god has placed on the inside of you and to be able to express that in a world of change and in a world that that is all over the place emotionally but to be able to be in the heat of a trial like paul and silas and still let the joy belts ring in your praise to me that's joy for you to jump around when everything's going good that's happy but if you can jump around when the when the ship is sinking when the washing machine gives up when the brakes give out when the tire is flat when people talk about you and misunderstand and misrepresent you but you can rejoice any way that's joy that's joy hallelujah jesus said we're told in scripture leave for joy when men will revile you and persecute you and cause you problems so so joy is an emotion but it's more like a deep abiding peace and happiness and thrill because you have set your heart toward a truth an absolute truth a truth that never changes no matter what age is presented no matter what circumstances it comes we set our heart toward a truth and no matter what the enemy says or does we keep it set if the enemy tries to pull us out of that place just real quickly we turn the knob we turn the dial we dial back to joy come on this is how we overcome remember the bible said the joy of the lord the joy of the lord the joy of the lord is my strength the word joy appears 88 times in the old testament in 22 books the word joy appears 57 times in the new testament in 18 of the book so joy and rejoice is covered throughout the scripture joy and rejoicing is mentioned 19 times in the book of philippians alone sometimes theologians will say that philippians is paul's joy book it's a book that's written about joy and i don't have time this was just a little outline that i put together to get ready for what we were going to share don't have time to go through every detail but philippians 1 says to have joy in circumstances philippians 2 tells us to experience joy in serving philippians 3 tells us to be joyful by having faith philippians 4 there's only four chapters i think know what joy is like while giving of yourself experience the joy of giving of yourself philippians 3 1 let's read that in the complete jewish bible that's how i gave it to you there ladies in conclusion my brothers rejoice let's see if we got it i can just read it in conclusion my brothers rejoice in union with the lord this is david stern dr david stern's translation in conclusion my brother remember in the king james this is finally my brethren in conclusion my brothers rejoice in union with the lord it is no trouble for me to repeat what i have written you before and for you it will be a safeguard when we see that word rejoice it's based on the word joy it means to again joy to joy again to do it again to choose joy again guess what you're going to have to choose it again and again and again philippians 4 4 in the king james says rejoice in the lord always and again i say rejoice philippians 4 4 in the complete jewish bible says rejoice in union with the lord always i will say it again rejoice let's see if you all have that did you find that one in the complete jewish bible philippians 4 4 rejoice in union with the lord always i will say it again rejoice now when you read something in the bible how many of you like to go back and find a little bit about the back story of why you're reading what you're reading if you don't do that then you're just scratching the surface of scripture if you want to know what's really being spoken you got to go back and don't just take a memory verse out but go back and find out the content and the context of of the verses before and the verses after we're talking about the apostle paul he's living now not in prison but under what we would call house arrest he can't go anywhere on his own he is spending now ten years a prisoner under house arrest his missionary journeys of going here and there and everywhere have been curtailed and he is being held in one spot and philippians think about this philippians is one of the books that he writes when he is under 10 years of house arrest and what does he say moan and groan because life isn't fair no he said rejoice you are in union with the lord always i will say it again [Music] i want you to know paul was the poster boy for having hard times he was a glorious glowing example of what it meant to be persecuted and beaten and mistreated and held captive in fact he could have been bitter because he knew his destiny he wasn't like some of us still trying to figure out why we're here paul knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that he had been raised up as an apostle he had been called brother branham said as a setter in order brother branham define apostle as one who sets things in order and this was the ministry of paul how can you go and visit the churches and set deacons in place and elders in place and bishops in place or pastors we call them now how can you do that if you are held in one place a prisoner for 10 years i want you to know he could have been bitter toward the government bitter toward the authorities he could have been bitter toward the devil he could have called everybody his enemy and he could have said everybody is out to stop me nobody wants me to be what god has called me to be think about it i've been beaten and whipped and shipwrecked and thrown snake bitten i've been this and that and the other and and i'm having a terrible time and nobody seems to know just how bad it really is and i'm not to blame i didn't do this this isn't my fault this is what's being done to me but you know what i don't find one verse not one verse in all the writings of the epistles the letters to the churches of the apostle paul he just said if i can't go i'll send them a letter it'd be like you and i saying today if i can't go physically i'll send them an email i'll shoot them a text but i will do what god has called me to do and that is to encourage the churches and to set them in order for the coming of the lord not only did he do that but god used his imprisonment and his house arrest god used it to preserve the messages that he was to give to the church if paul would have been able to always go to philippi if he would have always been able to go to colossae if he would have always been able to go to corinth or to thessalonica he could have preached under the inspiration and unction of the holy spirit but there were no tape recordings no one could have moved as fast as paul was preaching and just so you'll know he was a long-winded preacher i was going to preach this morning getting joy after a fall but i'll preach that another time i started on that about monday and tuesday studying and then i thought no no no i got to get something else we'll come back to that later getting joy after a fall because you know he was leaving the next morning and he had a lot to get in he had no idea when he would be there the next time so the bible said he preached till midnight in fact we've got every reason to believe he would have never stopped at midnight had someone not died and interrupted the whole service fell out the window fell asleep sunk to sleep fell out the window and died and the whole service had to stop to raise the young man from the dead and oh what joy read it for yourself what a joy it cost oh nobody was mad because the service got interrupted it was an opportunity for the power of god to be demonstrated he'd preached all night and would have kept on preaching had it not happened like this so he was a long-winded preacher and they would have never been able to write it all down but because god allowed him to be under house arrest and for a period of time prison imprisoned in a pit i've been to amber teen prison in rome i've seen down in the pit where the apostle paul wrote letters to the churches i've seen that little hole of light just a little hole where a little bit of light would come in in the daytime and at night there was no light it's more like a dungeon it was a place for prisoners to be tormented and i've looked down in there i want you to know something you shame on you i'm gonna get a little stirred here shame on you for that dusty bible somebody help me preach a little bit shame on you for that dusty bible shame on you if the only time you pick up your bible is on a sunday morning or a tuesday night let me tell you something he risked everything and suffered all things to be able to give us the word of the lord and had he not been under house arrest he would have just continued to go go go and had he not been in prison he would have just gone and those precious words would have never been recorded but because he couldn't get there he wrote them some believe with the help of a scribe because they believe his eyesight was poor i don't know i don't know if it was penned with his own hand sometime he said it was i don't know if it was all penned by his own hand i don't know all those details but i know that god allowed those letters to be written because you and i are still benefiting when we see the suffering of paul and instead of hearing his bitterness and his complaints and blaming everybody else because nobody will let him do what he was called to do we hear him saying hey rejoice read john do it again do joy again choose joy again i don't care how hard it is out there in in philippi i don't care how bad it gets over there in thessalonica rejoice and again i say rejoice because joy is not about your condition it's about your position it's about choosing to keep your heart and mind stayed on god's truth and what god has promised to you as an overcomer paul could boldly tell people to rejoice as he used himself as a prime example he was full of joy because he knew that no matter what happened to him outwardly jesus christ [Music] how can somebody rejoice under the shadow of the c word the prophet told us clearly do not fear cancer well if you're not going to fear it what are you going to do rejoice and again i say rejoice because god is good in the slim times in the abundant times god is good he's worthy to be praised when you feel good and when you feel lousy i'm not even preaching on praise but how can you express joy sitting on your hands through the years there have always been those who would say things like i don't like for church to feel like a a cheerleading time somebody telling me raise your hand stand up sit down kneel down run around i just don't like to be told what to do you've made that abundantly clear through the years it has been made abundantly clear to me that there are just some people that don't want to be even a strong suggestion of what they might do differently than what they're doing right now come on now but i mark those folk in my mind and i watch them from time to time and i have all the way through the years and i wait to see if they ever do it without being told and you know what you find out so many times unless they're reminded unless they're encouraged unless they're instructed unless they're exhorted to praise him they sit like a bump on a pickle [Music] don't you let it get quiet even if you're one of those even if you're like a bump on a pickle don't you be quiet now now's your time to say hey i can't help what i was but i don't have to be that anymore rejoice and again i say rejoice if paul could i can if paul could you can whoo they asked my granny sister shelly how do you feel i'm blessed i'm blessed she took one one or two radiation treatments and decided i can't take any more of that god still gave her a few years on the end of her life and she used every day of that and every moment of that to give god praise and to give god glory because she had been both a pastor and a businesswoman in the community the newspaper come out and did a big article i have a copy of it somewhere did a big article in the ledger inquirer about her life and about what she was going through and and part of the headlines is i'm blessed i'm blessed it's the testimony she gave to every person who came and sat across the desk from her right up until the year of her death she did income tax did him into the wee hours of the morning i've carried her a drink of water or drink of tea or something like that out to her desk at one o'clock in the morning with a whole lobby full of people waiting to get their tax done they'd been waiting since getting off work time there were people that came from everywhere from from out of state john kilpatrick the pastor of brownsville revival drove every year from pensacola florida to sit across the desk for my grandmother to do his tax we weren't stupid we knew there were greater accountants she wasn't even an accountant she was just a tax preparer we knew there were people that could do as good of a job as she could they didn't come because of that they came because they knew they were going to get a testimony with their papers they knew they were going to get a praise of the lord hallelujah and i knew that if i was there i was going to get a holler she was going to scream at the top of her lungs steve and i would go rushing out to see what she needed and she said she needs prayer i'd pray when i'd get through praying i'd say is that all and she'd say no said uh he needs prayer too he was telling me he has such-and-such now go pray for him and she'd just go right back they knew it was going to be a little bit of tax preparation and a little bit of church and even as i said the last text season she did they would say how do you feel miss shelley or sister shelley she'd say i'm blessed i can't complain i'm so blessed even though breath was getting shorter pressure was getting a little tighter and pain was getting a little more severe she learned you get a whole lot more out of joy then you do grieving you get a whole lot more out of setting up your mind to get back to joy to return to joy because joy is not about your condition it's about your position anybody with me joy joy joy joy and you know what there is a joy that is of a divine origin joy is an emotion it can even be a human emotion according to webster's dictionary if things are going good you can you can have a little joy worked up inside but there is a joy it doesn't originate with you it doesn't originate with me it's not a product of what i can squeeze together show i feel like no no no no no it's a gift it's a divine origin and it gives me strength when i'm weak somebody said what do you call that joy the joy of the lord his joy i preached to you last sunday what brought him joy that's the joy that he infuses into our lives that same joy to keep us pressing on sister zoe can you give me nehemiah chapter 8 verses 1 through 10. i'm going to get down here to a verse where there's a lot of pronunciation i can do it might not be right but i can do it but i'm going to skip it and all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the watergate and they spake unto ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of moses which the lord had commanded to israel are you still with me that is verse one now verse two and ezra the priests i know that i know that you have these i gave them to you this morning and ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women and all that could hear with understanding upon the first day of the seventh month and he read therein before the street that was before the watergate from the morning until i like to spiritualize when i can you want to get out by 12. that's not the biblical order the biblical precedent is he was reading the law from the morning until midday from about 11 to 2 maybe a little longer we need it sometime before the watergate from the morning of the midday before the men and the women and those that could understand and the ears of all here here's your part here is your part i do my part by studying all week i do my part by praying hearing trying to hear from the lord i have prepared hundreds of sermons that have never been preached because you get carried away in a study and you think that that's going to be what we need and the lord comes along and gives you something else and you put that back somewhere in a file and never get to it i don't consider that a waste of my time i consider that a part of who i am to be able to study god's word to be able to read to be able to research to be able to pray i don't know about you but i love it when god places something on our hearts like that i went to bed last night and as soon as i closed my eyes i was not asleep i couldn't have possibly been asleep but as soon as i closed my eyes i saw a name written in cursive writing right out across the sky right across my vision it was the name bobby b-o-b-b-y i opened my eyes and i could see bobby was still written there in my room just right out in my vision and i said i don't know who bobby is i didn't get a face sometime i get a face you do too i didn't get a face i just got a name b-o-b-b-y didn't even know if it you know even a woman could be called bobby it could be a nickname it didn't have to be a name it could be just a nickname it could be a robert it could be a bomb could be a lot of things b-o-b-b-y i prayed for every bobby that i could think of i prayed for bobby duke i prayed for bobby wurtz i prayed for bobby meeks i started letting my mind go through every body that i'd ever met and then i said lord i don't feel peace on any of that so i'm just going to pray for all the bobbies i don't know i i i mentioned it this morning to olivia because she said she didn't sleep very well i said i didn't sleep much at all but about 10 minutes at a time through the night because i kept thinking about who bobby is and praying for bobby and i thought i may get to church and somebody might request prayer somebody might say i know a bobby that stands in need of prayer it really doesn't matter it really doesn't matter what matters is if god gives us a little something like that what a privilege what a privilege i don't have to read his mail i don't have to know every detail of their life all i have to do is lift them up to the lord lord you know who bobby is this is a privilege to live a supernatural life it's a privilege that every one of us can enjoy every one of us can live a supernatural life because we're filled with a supernatural god anybody with me and here is your part my part is to study and pray and get ready to get over here and deliver i never want to take for granted that what i prepared on saturday night is good enough for sunday morning and so i take an hour every sunday morning to get up and go to the dining room table and look back over what i have studied and prepared sometimes i go with it sometimes i have to pull something else out because i feel him leading then when i finish that i go get a shower i get dressed and i get over here as close to 10 o'clock as i possibly can and sometimes i take another 30 minutes to go back over to make sure that what that's my part i'm not asking for your you know for your uh aw or or for you to think that's wonderful or for you to brag on me i'm not telling you that for that reason at all i'm telling you that's my part i receive 50 of the tithe that's given in this church that's what i provide for myself and my family with the rest of it stays here to pay the bills and things that are needed i have to pay tithing taxes off of mine just like you do yours so you treat me well you you treat me well you you make sure that i am taken care of in the labor that i do but here's your part this is your responsibility this is what you're supposed to do when you come to the house of the lord and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law am i am i preaching something out of context or something here am i just telling you through isn't that what we should do as believers we should give this word of god the highest respect somebody said well there's a little bit of man mixed in it i've never heard a message yet that there wasn't i never heard brother branham preach thus saith the lord from the first word out of his mouth to the last either i'm not one of those who believe such i believe there was a little bit of man in there sometime too when he greeted somebody when he said something wrong a little bit i don't believe that was us saith the lord when he mispronounced something or when he got a little detail out of play god let us have all of that to remind us that he was a sinner saved by grace and surrender to god and i know you all read those texts from jeffersonville and i know that some of you believe that every word that came out of his mouth was thus saith the lord but i want to tell you that's blasphemy i don't believe that you're making a man more than he made himself that is over the top he was a human being but the most surrendered i don't know of any man through the ages more surrender to his calling than brother branham was but he was a human being he didn't have perfect recall you don't have to say man most of us have clear enough vision to be able to see it our responsibility is to come and prepare our hearts to hear what the lord would have to say to us and we take every bit of that right back to the absolute we do it when brother branham is preaching because he told us to do that you should do that when your pastor is preaching because that's just god's order so you take what you hear back to the absolute word of god if it lines up pray into it until god reveals it to you and makes it clear to you but we have a responsibility when we come amen and and that's to give god every opportunity that we possibly can to speak to our hearts and instruct us for what's coming and that means not hanging out in the nurseries or the bathrooms or the couches or the sofas or the vestibule when it's unnecessary if it's necessary god knows your heart if it's unnecessary you should be sitting in here under the inspiration of the holy spirit i wouldn't take that back if you paid me double this week it's just the truth and you ought to say amen all right and ezra the scribes stood up upon a pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose and that purpose was to read the book of the law why because they had been in captivity and they didn't have access to these things and now they're getting used to being able to hear the word of the lord again and and so the scripture here in nehemiah names the names of some of those that were standing to the left of ezra the priest in verse four in verse five and ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was above all the people he was standing on an elevated platform behind a wooden desk that had been created been made had been crafted for that book of the law to be on while it was being read you follow all that so i sometimes people say i don't know why the preacher has to stand above i don't know why there has to be a big chair for him to sit in i don't know why there has to be a pulpit to stand behind these are just very practical things to help us receive the word of the lord amen one preacher came here one time many many years ago and he said there was brother shelley sitting up there in a red chair like the pope well the chair was dusty rose and i didn't think i was the pope not then or now now and ezra opened the book verse 5 in the sight of all the people for he was above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood up this is a way to show respect to god's word if the queen of england were to walk in here today if joe biden should shuffle in here today our president we would all stand up you would you would you would stand up because if you can't respect a man brother branham said you can at least respect the position that he holds then there's nothing more precious and the word of god is it's red don't get religious i know there's times you read another verse in this in the service and you don't stand up every time but it's just that and if you're not able god certainly understands that physically need to rest god understands that but what a privilege i love it because if we have a guest preacher here that comes and doesn't particularly practice that or or doesn't feel like he has liberty to ask you to stand i just love it when i when brother robert will stand i just love it when somebody else will pave the way and make it less awkward for the rest of us to get up and stand not to be religious just to give a little honor and a respect to the reading of the word my you want to hear it sometime when the prophet preached on respects we ought to listen to that from time to time amen let's go on and ezra bless the lord the great god and all the people answered oh oh my oh my this is so prophetic i wish i could show how some of you do the other day when i was speaking about something personal i look around there's people that turn to the wall facing the wall because they don't want to face look folks you've got a responsibility somebody's looking at you i've swallowed a lot of things knowing that somebody was watching me you can too i know there are people sometimes get mad in church and stomp out i wouldn't do that if i were you i'd sit to the bitter end i'd go out and complain then if i needed to but i wouldn't jump out like that for nothing in this world because i want you to know you don't ever know when you may meet an angel in the aisle i've seen them i've seen that kind i know what kind that is that's the kind that stood in balaam's way i know they're here sometime you don't want to encounter oh you're just trying to make people afraid no just trying to teach us a little respect sometimes we need to be reminded of that sometimes and all the people answered what amen amen amen amen amen amen and you know how they did it with lifting up their hands oh amen amen amen amen and they bowed their heads and worshiped the lord with their faces to the ground that's biblical you may not be jumping you may not be running there may be a time that you just stand there with your face bowed down in your heart reverencing the goodness of god come on now that's biblical i don't you just want me to act like you do no i wouldn't want you to do that that wouldn't be necessary but just do something show god's word respect and honor and show his presence amen amen somebody ought to amen amen and then verse 7 gives us a bunch of these names and the levites caused the people to understand the law and the people stood in their place i don't know if you know anything much about the the return of the exiles but this was after the third return there had to be three different alias three different returns because they got ready to do what needed to be done and no levites had come the priest had gotten comfortable in babylon so there had to be another exodus to bring the preachers out to bring the priest out so they could serve the lord and they caused this and this is their jobs josephine and hanan and pelia and the levites caused the people to understand the law that means they explained it means they broke it down and showed how we apply the law in our life that's what preaching does and the people stood in their play they've been standing up this whole time i said to rj when he come back there to help me with my mind i said rj i wonder if we could talk the people into standing up the whole service he looked at me laughed a little bit and he said i don't know i don't know you could try something like that and i said you know why i say that because when you all are standing up worshiping the lord this place looks full but when you sit down it don't look near as full these folks weren't standing up so the house would look full they were standing up because they were so glad to be back under the reading of the word that they just stood up the whole time so they read in the book of the law of god distinctly and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading verse 9 and nehemiah which is in which is the tershata and ezra the priests the scribe and the levites that taught the people said unto all the people this day is holy unto the lord your god listen now here's where i want to get more not i thought this was a solemn day and now he said a holy day a set apart day a sacred day and then he tells them more not nor weep for all the people wept when they heard the words of the law now verse 10 i want you to know the context i wanted you to know the context of the joy of the lord is your strength i wanted you to know the context we use it all out of context it's okay it's true don't matter how you use it the joy of the lord is your strength the joy of the lord is your strength the joy of the lord is your strength when you're weak the joy of the lord is your strength when you're having trouble the joy of the lord is your strength but i wanted you to see the context 70 years of exile stay with me no word no fellowship some hardship some suffering now they're back the word is being read openly to them again but they're weeping they're still caught up in the grief of the last 70 years then he said unto them look then he said unto them go your way weep not more not go your way eat the fat drink the sweet whoop this must have been a southern gathering there was no unsweet tea no unsweet tea at this gathering go your way eat the fat had to be beef ain't nobody gonna eat chicken fat drink the sweet and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for this day is holy unto our lord neither be ye sorry neither be ye sorry this is not time to be sorry this is not time to mourn this is not a time to weep he said this is not a time to live in regret caught in the past for the joy here's the context for the joy of the lord you're not a prisoner anymore you're not in babylonian exile anymore you are not cut off from the homeland anymore you have returned to the homeland [Applause] yes you have come back to the homeland you have returned to the word that's what he's saying not a time to weep not a time to mourn not a time to regret not a time to be sorry you've already repented repented every mile you walked from babylon to jerusalem the closer you got the more you repented because you saw the burned ruins and the destruction of the city that you were not there to protect because you had disobeyed me god's talking because you had disobeyed me and i sent you as exiles into a strange and confused land the land of babylon and now you're coming back and you got to thinking about all that and you got under a spirit of grief and you've come back to jerusalem and you're still moaning and you're still mourning and you're still grieving because you still live like those in exile but he said i want you to know it's time to eat the fat drink the sweet send portions to those who have nothing for this day is holy unto the lord neither be sorry for the joy of the lord for the joy of the lord for the joy of the lord for the joy of the lord for the joy of the lord for the joy of the lord for the joy of the lord for the joy of the lord is your strength nehemiah 8 1 we don't have to go back there but we just read it it mentions that this event occurred on the first day of the seventh month does that sound familiar to anybody that initiated the feast of tabernacles in fact the first day of the seventh month was the feast of trumpets and the feast of trumpets is the beginning of the celebration of the fall feast of israel and what we call the feast of tabernacles leviticus 23 24 the sisters have it there it says speak unto the children of israel saying in the seventh month and the first day of the month shall you have a sabbath a memorial of blowing of trumpets unholy convocation so they have spent 70 years out of the homeland excuse me 70 years out of the homeland in babylon in exile in captivity and bondage and now they're home and for the first time they can celebrate the feast of tabernacles which is a feast of joy it's not a feast of fasting it's not a feast of mourning it's not a feast of repentance it's a feast of joy it's one of the names it's one of the names the feast of simca the feast of joy and now he said so you're going to have to get out of the past you're going to have to get over your stuff and you're going to have to do what what you've been commanded to do blow the trumpets and celebrate the goodness of god this is a holy moad this is an appointment of the lord with his people that's why we're here this morning you may not see it as the same but i see it as the same we have come today to meet with the lord it's holy unto the lord it's sacred unto him and no matter what you're going through the answer is going to be always the same the joy of the lord is your strength the joy of the lord is your strength the joy of the lord is your strength come on now come on now remember joy's not joy unless it has expression that's not dragging that's pushing because sometimes all you can do is drag a leg but you do it in the right spirit you do it pushing with everything you got i'd rather drag to the house of god than not get there at all anybody say amen all right now let me go through this with you quickly and and we'll hurry along and uh as best we can i don't want to wear you out i don't want you to miss it but i i don't want you to be so weary you can't hear and some of you started off that way i can't imagine where you are now the feast of tabernacles was a feast comprised of three special appointments trumpets atonement and tabernacles just as the overall feast of passover is comprised of three holy events passover unleavened bread and first fruits these two sets of feasts were comprised of three special events three in the spring three in the fall and in between was shavuot 50 days after the feast of first fruits with shavuot which we call pentecost the feast of passover was fulfilled by the death the crucifixion and the death of the lord jesus christ on the cross the feast of unleavened bread was fulfilled by the burial of the lord jesus the feast of first fruits was fulfilled by the waving the as they were waving the first sheaves of harvest our lord jesus was a first fruit offering he was waved in resurrection over the heads of the people fulfilling the feast of first fruits that those first three feasts make up what we call pesach or passover but it's unleavened bread passover and feast of first fruits then 50 days later it's the pentecost it's the shavuot in the old testament it was giving of the law on mount sinai in the new testament it was the filling the infilling of the holy ghost on the day of pentecost where 120 received a baptism of fire it's powerful god meticulously you're still awake god meticulously fulfilled his word just as he promised you believe that now when the israelites were returning to jerusalem from exile after nehemiah had already gone back the cupbearer it took nehemiah to get back to get the levites there nehemiah and ezra gathered the people after this third exodus leaving exile leaving babylon and getting them back and now the law was being read the israelites were overwhelmed with sorrow and condemnation since their lives failed to meet god's law they saw their mistake they saw what they had done and they began weeping and tabernacles is supposed to be a feast of joy but in nehemiah 8 the people were grieved and depressed what were they grieved about they were grieving over the seemingly wasted years in exile away from the place where they know they should have been they had become enlightened by the teaching from the word of god what was being taught to them on this day the feast of trumpets it was not only being read but it was being expounded it was being taught it was being broke down they fell under conviction they saw how wrong their lives had been but ezra had no condemnation for them and neither did the god of israel he had gathered them back just like paul's sufferings and house arrest provided letters of truth that you and i can read today the exile of god's people caused them to come home with a fresh new appreciation for the goodness of god in his word it caused them there's nothing like the lack of the word the lack of getting to church the lack of being in the presence of the lord to make you appreciate it when you are able to come home and this is what we read about here but ezra came with no condemnation in fact he said quit grieving are you watching me or the phone quit grieving rejoice eat and drink and be merry and have joy for the joy of the lord is your strength and you're going to need his strength because we're still rebuilding this place come on now this is still an hour of restoration and you're going to need the joy of the lord basically ezra was saying you've come out of babylon now get on with your life anybody offended and that's pretty much what he was saying he said go your way get up and get out you came out of babylon now get on with your new life don't fret don't grump don't worry eat drink be merry in other words god had a purpose and a plan in your exile he was dealing with your heart issues he was dealing with your disobedience it's dealt with now in your home now quit living like you're exiled quit living like you're slaves to a foreign confused land you have come home this revealed word is the homeland you're no longer living under the confusion of babylon you're no longer living under the confusion of denominationalism you're no longer living under the umbrella of the mother you see the word your eyes have been anointed with eyes have you know who god is you know what original sin is you know what was under the seals you see god revealing himself just like he said he would christ is the mystery of god revealed the bride is the mystery of christ revealed we see adoption coming on we see maturity coming on closer than we've ever been before so stop your grieving rejoice rejoice do your joy again that's what it means do it again choose joy rejoice and again i say rejoice everything had a purpose and everything had a season you were once in a season to mourn you are now in a season to rejoice just giving you the word just tell me what's happening here if you want to apply that to the day and hour you live in you'd be a wise man you'd be a wise woman to update this scripture to your life today come on now i don't care how bad it is you're not in babylonian confusion i don't care how bad it is you're not a slave to sin anymore the enemy is not running you all over town anymore ecclesiastes 3 11. i'm going to hurry along now we're on page five that's pretty good there's 26 pages i asked uh luke or levi who brought it to me luke luke brought it to me i said you think i can be through with 26 pages by five he said no i think it'd be about seven you don't have much confidence in me to get through at five he hath made everything beautiful i just want to preach hallelujah yeah house arrest 10 years he had made everything beautiful in his time 70 years of babylonian exile he has made everything beautiful in his time i wish not to come to the lord sooner in life people tell me that all the time i wish you had of too i wish we all could have i came to him about as early as i could he met me the first time at 18 months visited me the next time at three and called me to preach at seven so i was pretty pretty early getting started started pretty early but i understand what people mean when they say i wish i hadn't wasted a day let me tell you something everything has a reason everything has a purpose you'll appreciate i want you to know you'll appreciate i saw some of you i saw some of you i saw a sister i'm not gonna call her name don't remember i saw some i saw some staggering around up here today i knew you'd pressed in to come up here and worship the lord i saw a few of you staggering around praising god i knew you'd got under something good i knew you were thankful that he had called you out of a life of sin i'm thinking about last sunday when we begin to testify and say i am going to call her name sister beth and sister beth got up and give her testimony i told the girl who cuts my hair this week i didn't tell her name but i said we had a testimony service sunday after service and a sister got up and said this is what i was [Music] but i ain't that i ain't that anymore to god be the glory she said well stephen you can't get any more plainer than that i said no plainer than that that's how i like it no need and dressing it up no need in making it sound glamorous there's no glamour in a life of sin whoa glory be to god let me tell you something i don't have to tell people like that to praise the lord i don't have to tell people like that to say amen amen because when much has been forgiven he who exists has experienced that overwhelming forgiveness of god they love the most they love much nobody has to beg them come on nobody has to beg them to praise the lord there there are there are some of them there some of them are right there there are some of them right there that's not all of them but that's some of them nobody has to beg them because they can say what i was and what i'm not what i am by the grace of god it all had a purpose it all had a season you had to walk through some of that or you'd have been as fickle as a backslider in the in the baptist church you know where they don't even believe in backsliding you you had to have a real real deep place a deep deep pit to reach up out of you'll never fall in that same kind of pit again the flame may flicker whoa but it'll never die it'll never go out because something will pull your heart and you'll find your way right back to what you know god has done in your life no church could have done it for you no preacher could have done it for you come on now no denomination could have done it for you this homeland this is the homeland that is what's got you out you may not have even known him but the word was seeking for you the word was searching for you the word was looking for you and he found you yes he did rejoice rejoice somebody [Applause] somebody ought to rejoice hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah don't nobody know like i know what he's done for me come on you do it for him [Music] like they used to see can't nobody do me like jesus hallelujah i don't know all of your testimonies don't matter you see that i don't know them all but i just heard an amen coming back there from paw paw i remember his not all of it just what he shared i remember what he told me was sitting on the coffee table in front of him when he realized this is not who i am my god that mercy you see people of aca bless his name you see people dressed up on a sunday morning that you worship with your whole life and you think it's always been like that with them but i want you to know there are people here this morning that were in the very far throes of sin and jesus not a church jesus found them confused about who they were confused about what they loved confused that's babylon whoa that's babylon you see them in here and they get on your nerves somebody's flag bothers you somebody's shouting bothers you somebody's laughter bothers you somebody screaming bothers you you are relic you you you're just a sainted relic but some of us have not forgot [Applause] some of us aren't so mad with the preacher that we can't get what we need from god some of us have made up our mind we're not going to waste these hours we spend over here on a sunday morning we're going to give god everything i'm going to give him everything i'm going to give him everything i have i've got to rejoice i'm all right everything he's made everything beautiful in his time i don't have my watch on i took it off also he has set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that god maketh from the beginning to the end it's 123. you don't have to look i just looked for you ecclesiastes 2 24 look at this there is nothing better for a man listen listen listen there is nothing better for a man than he should eat and drink and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor this also i saw that it was from the hand of god it is not an unbiblical principle for someone to enjoy the gifts of god in their life when when when others i know i know i know i know i know that summer morning and i know that some are groaning and i know there's some i know poor little widow women who who god bounces them back and brings them through and they're afraid to testify of what god's done because they're afraid they're going to offend somebody else who will think they hadn't grieved enough we're not living in the 1800s you don't have to wear black a whole year i'm not telling you that grief isn't real and that it won't revisit and that it won't eat at your life it will but don't you be ashamed if you get up one day and decide to live don't you be embarrassed if one day you say i've repented now now i'm going to get up and be who i am [Applause] how long would you have someone to be ashamed for what they've done in sin how long would you want them to pay a prize maybe you heard a testimony here by a young sister last sunday maybe you heard maybe you say well the last thing we know is that she was asking not to come the next thing we know is she's attending a service she did because she was invited to do so and because she had satisfied the requirement that was asked of her come on now how long does she have to go before she can rejoice thank you how long does she have to go before she can shout you got a probate you go put a probation period beyond the repentance season no no you might you might but i'm not eat and drink and rejoice and again i say rejoice don't fret don't grump don't worry you can't change the past [Applause] [Music] in the shortest summary the story of ezra nehemiah is the story of god's people coming home after 70-year exile and rebuilding jerusalem you remember i preached a series on restoring the gates of jerusalem when we first moved into this building i went through all the gates when they were restored and what they represented because they returned home the city was rebuilt the temple was restored and the stage was set for the eventual arrival of the messiah the history behind the 70-year exile is very important here and i'd like for you to listen to the notes i prepared just for a moment won't take long when all of judah was taken into exile when they were all forced to walk to ancient persia there were no buses there were no trains there were no camel trains to take them on they walked from jerusalem to persia to what we now know today as southern iraq and northern iran just like this scroll that's that's sitting here was hand carried out of iran or iraq hand carried when they came home when a family came home made aliyah in return really in fear they ran for fear in their life they hand carried that scroll they made the same walking journey that the children of israel made leaving jerusalem to persia and these people made their way home carrying that scroll and the possessions of a community that they had left behind when all of judah was taken into exile they're all forced to walk to ancient persia to where we would now know to what we would now know as southern iraq or northern iran the bible tells us that somewhere between four thousand six hundred and ten thousand people were taken into exile somewhere between forty six hundred and ten thousand people several thousand people were also left behind and the shocking reality is that the entire jewish population was so small maybe fifteen thousand people lived in jerusalem and about a hundred and twenty thousand lived in all judea but war and a terrible plague had nearly decimated the entire jewish population by the time of the exile in exile under better living conditions the group expanded from somewhere between 4 600 and 10 000 they expanded to an estimated 150 000 people in 70 years i'd say that's pretty supernatural multiplication even today a small jewish population continues to live in both iraq and iran though their existence is simple and persecuted but did you see this there were between 100 000 and 150 000 who were offered a chance to return to jerusalem to return home after 70 years of being out of the homeland and only a fraction i want you to hear this only a fraction of that 150 000 took advantage of the offer the king said go back here's the money here are the items for your temple you've got my blessing and my protection go home those who returned were a part of a great work of god those who stayed behind miss being a part of their story they had a life sure they had food sure they had families they had some community distinctives but they were not home when god's people first arrived in exile they had a very hard time conducting themselves as usual as they lived there for the 70 years they got more and more and more adjusted this is what the church is living through in this hour more and more adjusted to the world skirts getting shorter dresses getting tighter hair changing colors ear bobs and bobbles of all kinds hanging on us now that didn't used to hang on us come on now the more the longer you live in exile the longer you live under the influence of this world the more you'll long to stay in that even when the king says come home i'm making a way for you to come home it's harder it's harder it's harder anybody with me it doesn't really matter i'm going to say it anyway because it needs to be said i want to read this to you and i'm going to take just a few more moments it is 1 31. i need a few more minutes and then we'll uh always regret that i take so much time getting to where i want to get psalm 137 and 1 by the rivers of babylon there we sat down yay we wept when we remembered zion they just got there they just got to babylon they're remembering zion they're weeping we hanged our harps verse two we hanged our harps on the willows in the midst thereof for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they that wasted us required of us mirth saying sing us one of the songs of zion they felt mocked and persecuted this was not part of the persecution this was really a desire of the of the persian people to hear those robust worshipers that they had heard so much about they had heard nobody worships like the israelites nobody dances like the israelites nobody sings like the israelites it's like they used to say about pentecostals nobody worships like those people worship we're just going around we don't have any business getting involved in that we're just going to go watch them and these babylonians they they weren't just trying to chide them and persecute them they really longed to see some of that joyous dancing some of that glorious singing seeing us one of the songs of zion and they said it to them in return in verse 4 how shall we sing the lord's song in a strange land if i forget the old jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning if i do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if i prefer not jerusalem above my chief joy in the beginning all ten thousand of them longed to be home but as the years ticked along and as life became more prosperous even for the exile they longed to stay right where they were and when the news came only a few left with the first and only a few left with a second and only a few left with the third there were at least a hundred thousand people a hundred thousand out of a hundred and fifty thousand that chose to remain behind only one third 50 000 people the bible says the number is 47 000 something and and nearly 3 000 singers and priests and so forth but just common men and women about 47 000 of them decided to go home leaving a hundred thousand israelites in a land that had been uh slavery exile to them can you imagine the offer is made the invitation is made just like it's made here sunday after sunday won't you come won't you let him change your heart won't you let him soften the hardness of your life won't you come won't you worship won't you enter in won't you come home and some no thanks i'm okay right where i am the problem is we forget to notify our faces that we're all right where we are the way you look the the sadness the emptiness the coldness on people's faces testifies that they're not happy in babylon they're not happy underneath the burden of all the stuff they carry that you just don't have to carry anymore because there's been a way made for you don't breathe anymore somebody said i i just can't do it that quick just because you say so i can't just get out from under it then god's word is a lie and none of us ought to be following it because he said cast it all get rid of it the man who could have been the most bitter in the early church said rejoice don't worry about my my bondage don't worry about my shackles don't be troubled about my change rejoice you're afraid to say amen the scripture does not say that joy is our strength there's no way in the world you can get over it that quick trying to grunt until you can get joy it don't work that way but the bible doesn't say joy is your strength the bible says there's a joy that is of divine origin there's a joy that doesn't come from you it comes from the one who lives within you it's not your emotional you know effort that gives you joy it's surrendering all that is unlike joy it's choosing joy as a strategic position not basing it on your condition but choosing it as a strategic position you see joy is not a luxury are you still with me i'm almost i'm almost joy's not a luxury it's necessary joy of the lord the joy of the lord is a byproduct of obedience you obey and you can have the joy of the lord you obey and you can have the joy of the lord we cannot continue to grieve over the past it is time to continue our journey to do exactly what ezra the priest said go our way and rejoice at the goodness of god but but but but but but but but but but but come on come on i don't have to tell you who does all the button you are not the exception to the rule of god's word he sent his word to you he sent his word to you he sent his word to you as soon as you get over the need to be understood and you make up your mind the church didn't give it to me and the church can't take it away the church didn't give it to me and the church can't take it away this joy that i have the lord put it there to stay the church didn't give it to me and the church can't take it away i said the world didn't give it to me and the world can't take it away all the world didn't give it to me and the world can't take it away this happy face that i'm wearing you know jesus put it there to stay the world didn't give it to me and the world can't take it away this joy that i have the preacher didn't give it to me oh this joy that i have the preacher didn't give it to me oh this joy that i have the preacher didn't give it to me no the preacher didn't give it and the preacher can't take it away [Music] all this joy that i have the deacons didn't give it to me and their kids this joy that i have the deacon didn't give it to me i said the joy that i have the deacon didn't give it to me no no the deacon didn't give it and he can't take it away [Applause] all this joy that i have the devil didn't give it to me know this joy that i have the devil didn't give it to me this joy that i have the devil didn't give it to me no the devil didn't give it and the devil can't take it away nehemiah 12. you thought that was the dismissal song two verses 42 be and that means the second part of verse 42 and 43. it's like i gave it to you this is how they responded and the singers sang loud but we want to mourn some more we want to cry some more we want to think about all the spilt milk from 70 years no the singers sing loud with you hezeriah their overseer also that day they offered great sacrifices and did what rejoice for god whoa for god that's the origin of the joy of the lord for god had made them rejoice with in case you think this is just men folks joy don't get me started this was everybody joy the wives also and ian what's your name aaron the ids and the aarons the olivias the amelias natalias the avians and the abiels come on everybody the men vote rejoiced the wives rejoiced the children rejoiced so that the joy of jerusalem was heard to the netherlands to california to iceland to japan to have come on far off people don't need to see no morning there's plenty to moan about there's plenty to mourn about there's plenty to weep about but i want you to know there comes a time when we have to get up and live on where we have to make up our mind it's time to obey the lord in all things because joy is a byproduct of obedience all right i'm closing i want ladies give me this message please and then i'll stop witnesses jeffersonville indiana 1953 musicians are coming even though my girls let me know last night that even calling the musicians is not a signal that i'm finished there were some people one time the jews from the tribe of judah where they got their name because they wouldn't walk after the ordinances of god wouldn't keep his commandments god called king nebuchadnezzar to come in and to take them captive down into the land of babylon many of us remember remember the famous old story of how they hung their harps on the willow tree the weeping willow tree and they could not sing the songs of zion all their victory was lost not because that god wanted to take it away from them but because of their sin separated them from god that's the reason tonight that many of the christians hasn't got the victory let's go on that's the reason tonight that many of the christians hasn't got the victory it's because their sins have separated them from the blessing honey it's all it can be it's all it can be surely you wouldn't let anything else stand between you and your joy surely you wouldn't let anybody stand between you and the victory my lord have mercy if you really caught a vision of somebody trying to keep you from the victory you'd quarterback them you'd shove them right over come on now so there's only one thing that could be keeping people from getting back they've allowed their feelings to produce unbelief because that's what sin is that doesn't mean they're drinking smoking running around on their wife or their husband doesn't mean they're guilty of any of those things it just means they've allowed unbelief to start creeping up in their heart and when you do that you'll never get back to the joy until you cut that thing off so there's a time for repentance but when god is calling you back to the homeland come on come on come on don't let pride or anything else keep you from making your way back he said that's the reason tonight many of the christians hasn't got the victories because their sins has separated them from the blessing cut off out in the desert place alone and our hearts are hanging on the weeping willow tree because we can't enjoy whoa no wonder people look like they're dying sometime when we sing the praises of zion around here that's why we've got our hearts hanging on a willow tree and we can't enjoy the songs of zion come on come home come home you you you mean you want me to walk down there i'm not asking you to do any of the sword you don't have to come up here to come home to god you can come home right where you stand right where you sit you can come home once you get home to your temporary house you can turn your heart back to god and get that grub hole out and get rid of that unbelief you can do that you can do that without the preacher you can do that without your brother and sister you can do that in your own home with nobody looking then how's anybody going to know i've made a change don't ask such a silly question jehovah of miracles paragraph 49 we're nearly done play something solved one to what this is paragraph 49 he's not finishing he's just getting started tongues and interpretation given praise the lord praise the lord branham didn't call this down brother branham didn't subject this to church order and tell them they were out of order for letting this happen he received it as the lord sometimes the lord it should never be that the lord has to push his way in he said praise the lord praise the lord the joy of the lord is our strength isn't it that's our strength he said that's how we live it's by the joy of the lord that's in our midst anybody want to say amen in the message why beaumont texas down for brother green paragraph 41 but because that we do it that's the reason we're cursed that's the reason god puts this thing upon the church cold and dampness we're going to other places for pleasure instead of coming to the house of the lord for pleasure the house of the lord listen listen look at that the house of the lord is the joy of the lord why would brother branham make such a statement as that somebody said that's a big mistake it's not a mistake at all because there's nothing like coming together with god's people and entering in in faith and experiencing the corporate anointing that comes just like it did this morning the joy of the lord is the joy of his people he wants you to come to church and worship him and be happy and satisfied giving praise and honor and glory and wisdom and might and power to god he wants you to do that one more christ knocking at the door i've been wanting to read this for three weeks he's i'm going to keep some of them back but this is what i'm getting out paragraph 51 stand with me stretch your weary legs don't you just love to worship this is brother venom don't you just love to worship the messages sometimes are so cutting with the word but then you know after we've all been corrected and stand guiltless in the presence of the father oh my do i need the word do i need the word do i need the word to correct me do i need the word to wash me do i need the word to cleanse me do i need the word to purify me am i the only one that needs to sit under that word and be cleansed and purified and washed all the week [Music] the monday the tuesday the wednesday the thursday the friday the saturday i need all that washed off of me and that's what the word does when that word comes like that and you say amen doesn't matter how guilty you are when you can squeeze out an amen you are saying so be it and you are absolutely bringing yourself under the cleansing power of a word that might be offending your mind [Music] but you know it's the truth anyway and so with faith you say amen and when you do that effect of the word is to cleanse you and you stand in that moment you see we have got that pentecostal mindset i've got to come down to the front i've got to be have hands laid on me i've got to be prayed for i've got to tell the preacher what my problem is he's got to pray with sincerity for a few minutes and then it's all taken care of and i'm going to go out that's wrong that's the mentality of the denomination it's it's not the mentality of the revealed word we don't mind we don't mind to pray with you it's our joy to pray with you but i don't just wait till sunday morning to pray with you i pray over your needs all through the week because that's what we feel to do we're called to do it's part of our not not just our responsibility it's part of our joy to do that but you get you get something every time you come into agreement with the word and i want to say it again especially if it offends your mind if the preacher is preaching something that offends your mind and you are able with your whole being to say amen so be it it's truth anyway you bring yourself under the effectiveness of that word it's powerful the power of agreement if i preach on an ear bob and somebody with a nearby bone says amen that's the right thing to do if i say such and such a thing and you that kind of makes you want to buck up a little bit but you know it's the truth at least internally say amen amen i know it's right i know it's right i'm not been to doing it but i know it's right then you stand corrected and you stand guiltless in the presence of the father that's a powerful quote resting upon the grace of the lord jesus but i didn't come to the altar but i didn't pray but the elders didn't lay hands on me the word the word did it the word cleansed you the word helped you the word corrected you the homeland [Applause] you made it back to the homeland guiltless in the presence of the father resting upon the grace of the lord jesus he said i just love to raise my hands and worship him he said don't you like to do that how many believes in that raise up your hands oh my just worship him in song you're standing now so i can read one more patmos vision 268. these were the two i've been wanting to read for three weeks do you love him paragraph 268 papa's vision do you love him you know after the message is cutting and everything i like to hear the people get into the hymns you old grumble bucket well now he preaches till after one now and then we have to sing for another 30 minutes just tell the truth you didn't want to be here in the first place but you're not getting my praise you're not getting mine i can't afford to let you i love you but i can't afford to let you get my praise i can't afford to let you steal my joy i'm going to need it tomorrow i'm going to need the joy of the lord tomorrow i'm going to need it i'm going to need it to get through the week i'm going to need it when the calls start coming in and the people's needs are great i'm going to need the joy of the lord when discouragement comes and depression tries to come i'm going to need the joy of the lord he said do you love him you know after the message is cutting everything i like to hear the people get into the hymns and go to worshipping and singing in the spirit there's nothing more prettier than good old singing that's right i love good old-fashioned pentecostal singing not them overtrained voices that holds till they're speaking squeaking and turn blue in the face and don't know what they're singing i like somebody that maybe couldn't carry a tune in a basket but he gets under a pentecostal blessing he's got a pentecostal blessing now he's singing about it oh how glorious those melodious songs of the cross oh my oh my does that sound like some old stiff baptist preacher to you that's the prophet of god that that's the one who carried the elijah spirit to his generation and to us he's the one he wasn't the only one god used but he was the one that god chose for that job and so they try to make him starchy and they try to say he didn't believe in speaking in tongues and they try to say he didn't believe in shouting and dancing and carrying on like that but we don't listen anymore because we've read what he said and we've heard what he said and we know that there was nothing that thrilled in any more than to get into the presence of the lord he believed the word should have the preeminence he believed the most important part of the service was the preaching of the word but once you get out from under that you sing before the word to prepare the atmosphere for the word to go forth but once that word has gone forth he said you come in to sing and rejoice and worship and it seals that word into your heart so that it doesn't leak out sing it sing something let's worship together before we go today god bless
