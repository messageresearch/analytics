[0:00] for there's going to be another fleshed
[0:02] out manifestation of the same spirit
[0:06] life Jesus goes on multiple times in the
[0:17] Gospels to explain I and my father are
[0:21] are one when you have seen me you have
[0:25] seen the father we know that they were
[0:28] one and the same in spirit we know they
[0:32] were one in the same in essence but they
[0:36] had different purpose and they're
[0:39] different purpose determined their
[0:41] office but they were the same in spirit
[0:45] and there was only one and when you saw
[0:48] the son you were looking at the purpose
[0:50] of the father because the purpose of the
[0:53] father was revealed in the son and the
[0:55] purpose of the son was revealed by the
[0:57] son and one of these days you're going
[1:00] to stand before the Father's throne and
[1:02] you're going to be shocked there's going
[1:05] to be people yet still surprised to see
[1:07] Jesus sitting on his Father's throne
[1:12] maybe someone will yet ask but I thought
[1:16] that was the Father's throne and it is
[1:18] and yet you see Jesus sitting on his
[1:22] Father's throne why is that because the
[1:25] mystery of God was made manifest by
[1:29] Jesus Christ Jesus is the mystery he is
[1:34] the fulfillment of the mystery the
[1:36] fleshing out of the father the Ministry
[1:41] of Jesus the office of the Sun is the
[1:44] fleshing out of the purpose of the
[1:46] Father and so when he moved in the earth
[1:49] in a physical body it seemed as though
[1:52] he was separated from his father because
[1:54] he was being manifest in a body of flesh
[1:56] and yet he wanted us to understand today
[2:00] that everything he did he moved from the
[2:03] inside and
[2:04] everything he did he did in divine
[2:07] synchronization with his father the
[2:09] father was moving and as the father was
[2:12] moving in him he moved in the physical
[2:15] there was an eternal spirit of the
[2:18] Father inside that logos word was inside
[2:23] that which ushered out from the great
[2:26] fountain of life was inside him and when
[2:30] it moved the physical body that
[2:32] contained that deity that physical body
[2:35] moved for there's going to be another
[2:37] fleshed out manifestation of the same
[2:41] spirit life not one man but in the body
[2:49] of people not chosen by their track
[2:54] record here on earth not chosen because
[2:57] they were good from the time they were
[3:00] born till now but chosen at the good
[3:04] pleasure of the Father hallelujah
[3:07] according to the purposes of his will
[3:11] because it pleased him to choose you
