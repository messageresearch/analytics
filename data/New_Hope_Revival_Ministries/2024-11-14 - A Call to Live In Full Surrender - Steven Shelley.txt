Description:
Join Pastor Steven L. Shelley as he shares a stirring message on letting go of ambition, jealousy, and anything that hinders our connection with God. He challenges us to see ourselves as living temples, where Jesus holds the highest place, beyond any building or tradition. With urgency, he speaks of the "zeal for the house of the Lord" – a call to live in full surrender and make room for God’s presence in our lives. This is a message about devotion, purpose, and being consumed by God’s love in these crucial times.
