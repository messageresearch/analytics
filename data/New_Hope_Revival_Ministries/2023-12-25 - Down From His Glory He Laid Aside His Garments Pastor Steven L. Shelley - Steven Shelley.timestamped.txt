[1:03:42] Believers sing and Christ is born on
[1:03:44] Christmas morning I I don't know how
[1:03:47] they can sing that in their churches
[1:03:49] when they know they know that's not the
[1:03:52] truth they know that wasn't born on
[1:03:55] December 25th and how could they sing
[1:03:58] that and expect people to be ble blessed
[1:04:01] pick another one you know there's other
[1:04:03] ones uh I like to sing oh come let us
[1:04:06] adore him because I sing that all year I

[1:04:12] us adore him for he alone is worthy
[1:04:15] Hallelujah the lamb is worthy worthy
[1:04:18] worthy worthy but I just can't sing
[1:04:21] something like that for Christ is born
[1:04:23] on Christmas morning I even sometime
[1:04:26] along about July or August I I start
[1:04:28] singing when it's so hot you can't
[1:04:30] hardly stand it I start singing sometime
[1:04:32] Joy to the
[1:04:33] world Amen the truth is he was born
[1:04:38] folks and if he hadn't been born he
[1:04:40] couldn't have died hallelujah thank God
[1:04:44] that he did so that's kind of what I'm
[1:04:46] going to preach on
[1:04:48] today I know you're expecting my annual
[1:04:51] Christmas message and uh I don't want to
[1:04:53] disappoint you
[1:04:54] and uh so I'll give you my annual
[1:04:56] message in just a moment but uh I I want
[1:04:59] to read you this before I do you got
[1:05:02] this in your text but I want to read one
[1:05:05] quote and I didn't give it to them it's
[1:05:07] from the message s we would see Jesus is
[1:05:11] that your
[1:05:12] desire My Desire is to see him I want to
[1:05:17] see him in my home I want to see him in
[1:05:19] my family I want to see him in my own
[1:05:22] life I want to know he's there I want to
[1:05:24] see it in in my brothers and sisters I
[1:05:27] I'm not interested in in uh someone
[1:05:30] showing off how much they know or how
[1:05:33] much they've learned how many articles
[1:05:35] they've read uh people all the time will
[1:05:38] say I read an article well that don't
[1:05:39] make it
[1:05:41] so just because you read somebody wrote
[1:05:43] it don't mean it's the truth how many of
[1:05:46] you know that you you've got to take it
[1:05:48] to the word it's got to go back to that
[1:05:51] word of God and if it doesn't line up
[1:05:53] with the word I don't I don't care how
[1:05:54] good it sounds how educated it sounds I
[1:05:57] just really don't want any part of it
[1:06:00] but uh let me read this to you just this
[1:06:02] one quote from from s we would see Jesus
[1:06:06] paragraph 135 he said that's the message
[1:06:10] I was looking up there but I didn't give
[1:06:12] it to them that's the message to get to
[1:06:15] people not a
[1:06:17] cradle not a
[1:06:19] Manger Christmas is not mentioned in the
[1:06:22] entire book of the Bibles never one time
[1:06:25] did Jesus refer them to his birth but to
[1:06:29] his death so my annual Christmas message
[1:06:33] is about his death always because we
[1:06:36] know that he was born and we thank God
[1:06:38] that he was born but he didn't say
[1:06:40] remember my birthday he said remember my
[1:06:45] death this is what we have to keep
[1:06:47] before the people because it's possible
[1:06:50] to put him in a
[1:06:51] Manger this church age you know the
[1:06:54] yanes I don't know if if uh Sister
[1:06:57] Geraldine wrote it or brother Leno wrote
[1:06:59] it I'm not sure who wrote it but the
[1:07:01] yanes sang a song for years it said
[1:07:03] they've got him back in the manger again
[1:07:05] this church World they've put him back
[1:07:08] in a Manger because it's easier for them
[1:07:10] to deal with a little innocent baby in
[1:07:12] the manger but you know he'll never be
[1:07:14] that again the next time he comes he
[1:07:17] won't come like a little Meek mild lamb
[1:07:20] in a Manger he'll come as a a lion of
[1:07:23] the tribe of Judah he he'll come with a
[1:07:26] roar he'll come to deliver his people
[1:07:29] and he'll come to execute Justice and
[1:07:31] judgment on the earth so I want you to
[1:07:33] look to that one I want you to see uh of
[1:07:36] course the lamb and the lion I want you
[1:07:38] to know that the lamb has become a lion
[1:07:40] there's no doubt about that do you
[1:07:43] believe it let's stand let's just get at
[1:07:45] it no need for any more uh formalities
[1:07:48] here uh I looked real quick I didn't
[1:07:51] have a lot of extra time this morning um
[1:07:54] I left the house 5 minutes late and um
[1:07:57] when I got here I had to uh record a
[1:08:01] video greeting for the convention this
[1:08:03] morning in uh Nuru Kenya and uh my heart
[1:08:08] is there and I'm so thankful for what
[1:08:10] God is doing among those precious people
[1:08:13] I've been able to catch some of it
[1:08:14] online and uh they are blessed they
[1:08:17] didn't need me they're blessed with
[1:08:19] amazing anointed preachers and and
[1:08:22] glorious work worship but I needed them
[1:08:26] I would have loved to have been there
[1:08:28] but it wasn't the mind of God for this
[1:08:30] season so they asked me to send a
[1:08:33] greeting this morning and I was doing
[1:08:35] that and I didn't have a lot of time to
[1:08:37] check the birthday so the only one I saw
[1:08:39] I may have missed somebody you speak it
[1:08:41] out or tell on somebody if you need to
[1:08:44] next Saturday is Zachary ellsworth's
[1:08:46] birthday December the 30th and so we
[1:08:48] wish him a happy birthday he's just got
[1:08:50] off the the platform but we wish him a
[1:08:53] happy birthday is there another birthday
[1:08:55] this week that we should mention or an
[1:08:56] anniversary or anything like that all
[1:08:59] right so let's go right to the Lord
[1:09:01] that's they say that's terrible you'll
[1:09:02] mention zachar but won't talk about
[1:09:04] Jesus's I just
[1:09:06] did I just did John Chapter
[1:09:11] 13 if I were to take a subject today I
[1:09:14] would call this down from his glory he
[1:09:18] laid aside his garments all right John
[1:09:21] 13 beginning in verse one one now there
[1:09:25] now before the Feast of the Passover
[1:09:28] when Jesus knew that his hour was come
[1:09:32] that he should depart out of this world
[1:09:35] unto the father having loved his own
[1:09:39] which were in the world he loved them
[1:09:42] unto the end you believe that and supper
[1:09:46] being ended not breakfast brother
[1:09:49] brandham used to say it wasn't the
[1:09:51] Lord's breakfast it wasn't his lunch it
[1:09:54] was supper and supper being ended the
[1:09:57] devil having now put it into the heart
[1:10:00] of Judas ascarot Simon's son to betray
[1:10:04] him Jesus knowing that the father had
[1:10:08] given all things into his hands and that
[1:10:10] he was come from God and went to God he
[1:10:14] really didn't have to worry too
[1:10:16] much he knew where he come from and he
[1:10:19] knew where he was about to go he riseth
[1:10:22] this is Jesus riseth from supper and
[1:10:25] laid aside his garments he took off his
[1:10:29] outer tunic and he only had on then
[1:10:32] underneath a light cotton or linen
[1:10:35] garment and that inner garment would
[1:10:38] have been just above the knee most
[1:10:40] likely the outer tunic would have been
[1:10:42] longer and and more modest but he is
[1:10:45] with his disciples he's not in public
[1:10:48] he's with his disciples and he riseth
[1:10:51] from supper he laid aside his outer
[1:10:53] garments and he took a towel and wrapped
[1:10:56] it around himself girded himself it says
[1:11:00] in King James after that he porth water
[1:11:03] into a basin and began to wash the
[1:11:07] disciples feet and to wipe them with the
[1:11:11] towel where was wherewith he was girded
[1:11:15] do you see that can you picture that in
[1:11:17] your mind our
[1:11:19] Lord our Lord our conquering King
[1:11:25] nothing was made without him everything
[1:11:28] that was made was made by him and yet he
[1:11:31] has bowed down taken off his his uh robe
[1:11:36] that that protected his
[1:11:38] modesty and he has knelt down with a
[1:11:41] towel wrapped around his waist and he is
[1:11:44] washing the dirty disciples feet I
[1:11:47] should say the disciples Dirty
[1:11:51] Feet you got to watch where you put
[1:11:53] those things right uh and then and then
[1:11:56] he dries them with a towel that he's
[1:11:59] tied around his waist then cometh he to
[1:12:01] Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him
[1:12:04] Lord Dost thou wash my
[1:12:07] feet and Jesus answered and said unto
[1:12:10] him now none of us are surprised at
[1:12:11] Peter are we we would expect as much out
[1:12:14] of Peter Jesus answered and said unto
[1:12:17] him what I do thou knowest not now but
[1:12:20] Thou shalt know hereafter just bear with
[1:12:24] me Peter you may not understand it all
[1:12:26] now but you're going to understand it
[1:12:28] shortly and Peter saith unto him Thou
[1:12:32] shalt never wash my feet now Peter
[1:12:36] wasn't speaking to him in Rebellion he
[1:12:39] was speaking to him in loyalty and honor
[1:12:42] and respect I need to be the one if we
[1:12:46] can turn this thing around and let me
[1:12:48] wash your feet but I'll never let you
[1:12:51] wash my feet Jesus answered him if I
[1:12:54] wash thee not thou Hast no part with me
[1:13:00] I want you to know the gentle rebuke of
[1:13:03] the master changed Peter's
[1:13:06] Outlook how many of you know it changed
[1:13:08] him and Simon Peter saith unto him Lord
[1:13:12] if that be the case if I can't have any
[1:13:15] part of you unless you wash my feet I
[1:13:18] would just appreciate you washing not
[1:13:20] just my feet only but wash my hands and
[1:13:23] my head what is Peter saying he's
[1:13:26] saiding just wash all of
[1:13:29] me I don't even like
[1:13:33] me Peter saying I don't even like me I
[1:13:36] don't even like who I am cleanse me from
[1:13:40] the top of my head right down to the
[1:13:42] bottom of my dirty feet this wasn't
[1:13:45] water that was going to do the job there
[1:13:47] was something coming greater than water
[1:13:49] what water can do what soap and water
[1:13:52] can do there is a blood how many of you
[1:13:55] know there is a
[1:13:57] blood that can do more water you can get
[1:14:00] dirty again you that have toddlers know
[1:14:03] you wash them clean them hose them down
[1:14:05] whatever you do and in a few minutes
[1:14:07] they're dirtier than they were to start
[1:14:09] with but I want you to know there is a
[1:14:11] blood that cleanses us so
[1:14:16] thoroughly so thoroughly so completely
[1:14:19] so totally that we don't ever have to be
[1:14:21] dirty in his side again
[1:14:24] All of Me Lord let's go
[1:14:26] on Jesus saith to him he that is washed
[1:14:29] needeth not save to wash his feet but it
[1:14:33] clean every is clean everywhere and ye
[1:14:37] are clean but not
[1:14:39] all for he knew who should betray him
[1:14:44] therefore said he ye are not all clean
[1:14:48] you may let me wash your feet but
[1:14:51] there's something staining somebody
[1:14:54] that can't be washed off with this water
[1:14:56] dried with a towel so after he had
[1:14:59] washed their feet and had taken his
[1:15:01] garments and was set down again he said
[1:15:04] unto them know ye what I have done to
[1:15:08] you you call me master and Lord and you
[1:15:12] say well for so I
[1:15:14] am few more
[1:15:17] verses if I then your Lord and Master
[1:15:20] hath washed your feet ye all also ought
[1:15:24] to wash one another's feet what an
[1:15:27] example are you with me this morning for
[1:15:31] I have given you an example that you
[1:15:33] should do as I have done to you it's so
[1:15:39] much deeper than just washing one
[1:15:42] another's feet I believe in foot washing
[1:15:45] and and I'm not even a Free Will Baptist
[1:15:48] but I believe in foot washing but I
[1:15:51] don't believe that's all he was talking
[1:15:53] about here I believe he was talking
[1:15:56] about the action of Grace and I believe
[1:15:58] he was talking about the action of
[1:16:01] forgiveness and I was I believe that he
[1:16:03] was saying we ought to learn how to show
[1:16:05] Grace to one another and we ought to
[1:16:08] learn how to cover iniquity with
[1:16:10] love because the blood does the work
[1:16:13] come on and if you have an opportunity
[1:16:16] to cover someone's nakedness or expose
[1:16:18] it Jesus is saying I would prefer you
[1:16:21] learn the lesson to cover
[1:16:24] it because my blood deals with every bit
[1:16:28] of that stuff did I miss did I did
[1:16:30] anyone misunderstand what I'm saying
[1:16:33] it's a respect that they showed to a
[1:16:34] drunken
[1:16:36] Noah instead of just standing there and
[1:16:39] gazing on his Humanity somebody decided
[1:16:42] to turn their back and show some respect
[1:16:44] and the bride if we're going to operate
[1:16:46] in perfect love we're not going to cover
[1:16:49] each other's sins in such a way that
[1:16:51] people are allowed to continue in their
[1:16:53] sin but we're not going to hold people
[1:16:55] to an accountability that we don't hold
[1:16:57] ourselves
[1:16:59] to how many of you understand that a lot
[1:17:02] of people are more worried about
[1:17:03] somebody else's
[1:17:05] sin they're real hard on somebody else's
[1:17:08] sin while they hold on to their own
[1:17:11] that's not how the bride's going to
[1:17:12] operate that may be how the church has
[1:17:15] operated but that's not how the bride
[1:17:17] Kingdom operates how many of you have
[1:17:19] been transferred from a church age to a
[1:17:22] kingdom
[1:17:24] a bright age verily verily I say unto
[1:17:27] you the servant is not greater than his
[1:17:29] Lord neither he that is sent greater
[1:17:32] than he that sent him if you know these
[1:17:36] things Jesus was talking some deep talk
[1:17:39] here yes sir that was much Beyond just
[1:17:43] washing one another's feet in some sort
[1:17:45] of a ceremony do you believe that it was
[1:17:48] yes do you believe that we should do it
[1:17:51] at to one another in a physical
[1:17:53] absolutely but if you never did it in
[1:17:56] the physical if you never had
[1:17:58] opportunity to do that again in the
[1:18:00] physical you have a chance to do that
[1:18:02] every day in your own life by letting
[1:18:06] people
[1:18:07] go by letting people go what do you mean
[1:18:10] by forgiving
[1:18:11] people not binding people to ourselves
[1:18:14] in unforgiveness forgive them well they
[1:18:17] didn't ask for forgiveness who
[1:18:20] cares it's not for
[1:18:23] him it's for you to get
[1:18:26] free how many of you don't want I don't
[1:18:28] want to stand in the last day and
[1:18:30] realize that broken chains have bound me
[1:18:33] if God breaks the chains step out of
[1:18:35] them get away from them little bride
[1:18:38] you're free father we thank you that you
[1:18:42] are alive in this house and you are
[1:18:44] alive in our hearts bless now our time
[1:18:48] together we pray in the precious name of
[1:18:50] the Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory
[1:18:53] and the Saints said you may be seated
[1:18:56] I'll just mention I see here where
[1:18:58] brother Ryder has asked us to remember
[1:19:00] him he's fighting the flu in South
[1:19:03] Africa and I see where brother Trey and
[1:19:05] sister Autumn are not able to be here
[1:19:07] today but would of course we want to
[1:19:09] lift them up to the Lord in prayer and I
[1:19:12] see others that are joining us down from
[1:19:15] his
[1:19:16] glory Jesus laid aside his garments in
[1:19:22] John 13 4 that I just read in the
[1:19:25] complete Jewish Bible it says so he rose
[1:19:30] from the table removed his outer
[1:19:33] garments and wrapped a towel around his
[1:19:37] waist now when we see that towel around
[1:19:41] his waist it might remind us of a of a
[1:19:44] waiter's
[1:19:46] apron and and and that is wrapped around
[1:19:49] him to to uh to protect his unifor form
[1:19:53] but but it's also there to identify him
[1:19:57] so that you'll know he's there to do a
[1:19:59] job he's there to clean the table perhap
[1:20:02] maybe it's a a bus boy who is dressed
[1:20:05] like that so this was to do this in in
[1:20:09] what we call Middle Eastern culture but
[1:20:13] but historically it would be called uh
[1:20:15] far east or NE East culture in order for
[1:20:20] this to take place this is a real
[1:20:23] condescension you know we've heard from
[1:20:26] the scripture and from the message of
[1:20:27] the hour that because of the of the
[1:20:30] dirty roads and because of the terrain
[1:20:33] and because of the condition of the
[1:20:35] roads in that day Rome had not built all
[1:20:38] the roads yet they were rebuilding a lot
[1:20:41] of roads but they hadn't some of these
[1:20:43] were donkey trails and they got dirty
[1:20:45] and you'll read in a moment when I share
[1:20:47] with you something that brother random
[1:20:49] said there there there was
[1:20:51] manure I hope I don't nauseate you there
[1:20:54] was manure that had squeezed up between
[1:20:57] their toes when you went to a a a guest
[1:21:01] as a guest to someone's home and now it
[1:21:04] it's a at least a Canadian uh culture
[1:21:07] and and maybe maybe we have adopted that
[1:21:09] sum in the South that we take off our
[1:21:12] shoes when we go into somebody's house
[1:21:15] and we do that because uh we don't want
[1:21:17] to get their floors dirty with with dirt
[1:21:20] or debris or something on our shoes it
[1:21:23] was the opposite in the Bible that you
[1:21:26] didn't you weren't expected to take off
[1:21:28] your shoes because your shoes were dirty
[1:21:31] you had sandals on and so your feet were
[1:21:34] dirty anyway because the sandals are
[1:21:37] open with straps on top and on the ankle
[1:21:40] if you've seen the the shoes that they
[1:21:42] were beginning to wear in second temple
[1:21:44] period that were influenced by the
[1:21:46] Romans the the sandal of the second
[1:21:48] temple was a slip on but when the Romans
[1:21:51] came they started tying long straps
[1:21:54] around you've seen those Centurion type
[1:21:56] sandals that people even wear today you
[1:21:59] you start walking out those dirty roads
[1:22:01] with that kind of a footwear on and your
[1:22:04] feet are going to get dirty they're
[1:22:06] going to get smelly they're really
[1:22:09] really going to need to be cleansed
[1:22:10] because if you were invited to a place
[1:22:12] of esteem A A Home of esteem it was the
[1:22:16] rugs that they wanted to protect because
[1:22:19] these were handwoven rugs you go to
[1:22:22] Jerusalem you'll see them today in the
[1:22:25] in the old city and they're selling them
[1:22:27] and they come from the Orient and I find
[1:22:29] them to be extra beautiful some of them
[1:22:32] in in Vivid colors and they are they are
[1:22:37] durable but they're valuable and these
[1:22:40] rugs if they're real they are passed
[1:22:44] down from generation to generation to
[1:22:47] generation and they are to be long
[1:22:49] lasting so to keep them clean is it's a
[1:22:52] good step you can't keep from stepping
[1:22:54] on them but you can keep from stepping
[1:22:57] on them with dirty feet so brother
[1:22:59] random tells us that in this story in
[1:23:02] the Bible when a party was given and the
[1:23:05] guests were come then the Servants of
[1:23:08] the of the host would meet the guest at
[1:23:11] the door and they would they would uh
[1:23:15] help them assist them in taking off
[1:23:17] their sandals and they would take them
[1:23:19] over to a little place near the door and
[1:23:22] they would wash their feet and this was
[1:23:25] a real welcome it was oh my it was like
[1:23:29] saying uh uh my casa is your casa my
[1:23:32] house is your house you are welcome here
[1:23:35] but but not your dirty feet you get it I
[1:23:39] got carpets I got rugs so we're going to
[1:23:42] wash your feet and we're going to anoint
[1:23:43] your head and we're going to make you
[1:23:46] feel welcome but but Jesus was invited
[1:23:48] to the party remember and he didn't get
[1:23:51] the same Tru treatment that everybody
[1:23:53] else got but God wasn't going to allow
[1:23:55] him to go
[1:23:57] unwelcomed there was a woman who had
[1:23:59] needed him there was a woman who had
[1:24:01] needed his forgiveness and needed what
[1:24:04] he represented and she barged her way in
[1:24:07] and Uninvited Guest and she made sure
[1:24:11] that even though the host didn't take
[1:24:13] time I wonder how many church services
[1:24:16] this morning Jesus is invited to and
[1:24:18] implored to but then sat down on a stool
[1:24:21] in the corner with no one to worship him
[1:24:24] with no one to praise Him liturgy takes
[1:24:27] the place of praise and worship form and
[1:24:31] tradition takes the place of praise and
[1:24:33] worship we not only want him to come
[1:24:35] when we come but we want to thoroughly
[1:24:38] welcome him in our midst we want to see
[1:24:41] that his head is Anointed we want to see
[1:24:44] that his feet are washed and he is made
[1:24:46] to feel like we want him because we do
[1:24:49] love him and we do want him in the midst
[1:24:51] are you with me so back to John supper
[1:24:54] was
[1:24:55] ended supper is a time of
[1:24:58] self-gratification you're feeding the
[1:25:01] body a supper was a was a meal of
[1:25:05] Delicacies in that part of the world and
[1:25:08] uh the best food was saved for the
[1:25:11] evening meal and it was it was taken in
[1:25:14] courses and it was a long Affair so long
[1:25:18] that the custom was to recline while
[1:25:21] you're eating
[1:25:23] wouldn't you be kind of shocked if you
[1:25:25] invited somebody to your house and and
[1:25:27] they said can I pull the couch up here
[1:25:28] to the table and lay down while I eat
[1:25:32] but it was believed in that time that it
[1:25:34] was good for digestion to sort of sit in
[1:25:36] a in a halfway recline position so you
[1:25:40] you didn't have to be in a hurry you
[1:25:41] were already just kind of relaxed in
[1:25:44] your in your posture and you're just
[1:25:46] eating the Delicacies that have been
[1:25:48] saved been too too nice to to eat at
[1:25:51] breakfast or or lunch but but these were
[1:25:53] supper Delicacies so it was a time of
[1:25:56] self-gratification it was a time of
[1:25:59] enjoyment it was also time for the host
[1:26:02] to show off his
[1:26:04] wealth so if he was poor he offered uh
[1:26:07] what he had lentils uh cooked in some
[1:26:10] way maybe with a little lamb fat to give
[1:26:13] them a little bit of flavor but if he
[1:26:16] was a wealthier man he may have offered
[1:26:19] what we now call fogra he might might
[1:26:22] have given Goose liver or the liver of a
[1:26:26] of another kind of bird a duck or
[1:26:29] something like that these Delicacies
[1:26:31] were eaten in second temple period in
[1:26:35] the time of the Bible so uh if you were
[1:26:37] in a place of any esteem at all you had
[1:26:41] eaten well you had relaxed you had been
[1:26:44] given the best wine you had been given
[1:26:47] the best bread and the time of me was
[1:26:50] coming to an end the the Bible is clear
[1:26:53] when it tells us from the Greek into
[1:26:56] English supper being ended he's telling
[1:27:00] us it's no longer about each
[1:27:03] guest it's no longer about uh uh feeding
[1:27:06] the flesh something else is about to
[1:27:09] happen and so it goes on you you have to
[1:27:13] know sometime when your bless me period
[1:27:16] has
[1:27:18] ended you see people talk about the
[1:27:21] altar as though it was a place to come
[1:27:23] and get a
[1:27:24] blessing but really biblically the altar
[1:27:27] was never a place to come and get a
[1:27:29] blessing was it it was a it was a place
[1:27:31] to come and die so if you want a
[1:27:34] blessing you got to come and be willing
[1:27:36] to die there comes a time that it can't
[1:27:39] be about feeling it can't be about uh
[1:27:42] you know unction it can't be about
[1:27:45] Goosebumps there's a time that only
[1:27:47] faith can sustain us and that's the hour
[1:27:50] we're living in right now you you can't
[1:27:52] go on the strength of your shout you
[1:27:55] can't go on the strength of your praise
[1:27:57] you can only go on the strength of your
[1:27:59] faith and your faith will teach you that
[1:28:02] the more you
[1:28:03] praise the more oil gets poured on your
[1:28:06] faith it's a cycle and it's not vicious
[1:28:09] it's
[1:28:11] powerful it's a beautiful cycle the more
[1:28:14] we praise the more we worship Him the
[1:28:16] more of his blessings pour down but
[1:28:19] there comes a time that we can't just
[1:28:21] sit around and get F on the blessings on
[1:28:24] the Delicacies there time there comes a
[1:28:26] time that we have to work for one
[1:28:28] another there comes a time we have to
[1:28:30] fight for one another and Jesus is about
[1:28:32] to teach the disciples your your
[1:28:35] constant
[1:28:37] Buffet is about to be over you're fixing
[1:28:40] to face the deepest and darkest Trials
[1:28:42] of your life and the only way I know to
[1:28:45] give you strength to move forward is to
[1:28:47] show you how to serve one
[1:28:49] another the purpose of the five-fold
[1:28:52] Ministry is not to be
[1:28:53] served the purpose of the five-fold
[1:28:56] ministry is to serve and if anyone knows
[1:28:59] the value of respects it always does us
[1:29:02] right it always benefits us to show
[1:29:06] respects to the men of God but the
[1:29:09] ministry is not in place there that we
[1:29:12] would serve them God has raised them up
[1:29:15] that they might serve us so sometimes
[1:29:18] there's blessing but it's a mixture
[1:29:20] always of suffering and blessing it's a
[1:29:24] mixture of delicacy and servanthood it's
[1:29:28] a mixture of getting blessed by the
[1:29:30] presence of God but letting the spirit
[1:29:33] of the Lord not only anoint our mouth
[1:29:35] but go down and anoint our feet and take
[1:29:38] us to places as we surrender our will
[1:29:41] and say yes to him it it rubber meets
[1:29:44] the road after the meal is over are you
[1:29:46] following me that's when things start
[1:29:48] getting serious are we going to have
[1:29:51] another round of dessert are we going to
[1:29:53] start learning our lessons Jesus said
[1:29:56] it's time for the for the bless me to be
[1:29:59] done Delicacies are coming to an end and
[1:30:01] now I'm going to get up and show you how
[1:30:03] to serve one another and so he gets up
[1:30:06] and he lays aside his garments as we
[1:30:08] said a moment ago he took off his outer
[1:30:10] cloak a a and anyone can wash the feet
[1:30:14] of someone who loves
[1:30:15] them and who they
[1:30:19] love anyone even people that don't like
[1:30:23] feet are you with me anybody if you love
[1:30:27] somebody I don't think there's a mother
[1:30:30] that I've ever met that wouldn't have
[1:30:33] washed the most filthy feet in all the
[1:30:35] land if they belong to the one they
[1:30:38] loved that little one looking up now
[1:30:40] they might not always wash their
[1:30:42] husband's feet they might tell him to go
[1:30:44] get a shower but they're going to wash
[1:30:46] that little one's feet and they're going
[1:30:48] to Mother them and they're going to take
[1:30:50] care of them but I want you to know
[1:30:52] Jesus was about to show a bigger lesson
[1:30:54] than just washing the feet of those who
[1:30:56] love you those who are going to go all
[1:30:58] the way with you he was about to wash
[1:31:01] the feet of the very one that was to
[1:31:04] betray
[1:31:06] him this is how we know that we have
[1:31:09] crossed from Death to life when we can
[1:31:12] serve those who are out to destroy
[1:31:16] us I spent many years of my life God
[1:31:20] helped me to continue and to even do
[1:31:22] more but I've spent many years of my
[1:31:25] life ministering and serving people that
[1:31:28] were out to destroy me and you just have
[1:31:32] to say there's always going to be a
[1:31:34] Judas
[1:31:36] kiss but servanthood is not
[1:31:40] discriminatory we serve the body you
[1:31:43] know this message that I preached a few
[1:31:45] weeks ago again the second time I
[1:31:48] preached it in 2019 or 2020 and then I
[1:31:51] pre preached it again in 2023 dance or
[1:31:54] die I initially preached that message
[1:31:57] for a family that was sitting here in
[1:31:59] this church dying on the
[1:32:03] vine wouldn't praise wouldn't worship
[1:32:07] wouldn't say Amen wouldn't support what
[1:32:10] we were trying to do and God kept this
[1:32:12] is his Mercy week after week after week
[1:32:16] I would lay before the Lord for a word
[1:32:18] and he would give me a word like that
[1:32:20] dance or die giving them an opportunity
[1:32:24] to make I remember the day the spirit of
[1:32:26] God highlighted the quote from the
[1:32:28] church age book where brother brandom
[1:32:30] said sometime we just have to cry out to
[1:32:32] God I've been wrong and we don't gravel
[1:32:36] we don't gravel in our wrongness we
[1:32:39] don't have to get beat because we
[1:32:41] realize that we've been wrong we just
[1:32:43] cry out Lord I'm wrong and I want to be
[1:32:47] right and so when we're wrong and we
[1:32:49] want to be right sometime one of the
[1:32:52] ways that we can get out of that place
[1:32:54] get out of the rut get out of the grave
[1:32:57] get out of the spirit of death is to
[1:32:59] offer a praise to God one that exceeds
[1:33:03] the
[1:33:05] shoulders one that gets a little higher
[1:33:07] than the
[1:33:09] ears when someone says I've got a gun on
[1:33:13] you you better
[1:33:14] surrender I've got a feeling that you're
[1:33:16] going to do more than
[1:33:20] hips come on I got a feeling you're
[1:33:24] going to go as high as your agility will
[1:33:26] let you go you're going to fully
[1:33:29] surrender and sometimes that is all it
[1:33:32] takes is a full Surrender by saying yes
[1:33:36] I don't know how to undo the mess but I
[1:33:38] know how to praise you when I praise you
[1:33:42] it's not trying to vote for the preacher
[1:33:44] I'm not voting for the pastor by
[1:33:46] praising the Lord I'm not taking sides
[1:33:50] by praising the Lord I'm not going to
[1:33:52] use praise for a political move I'm
[1:33:55] going to praise him because he's worthy
[1:33:57] I'm going to praise him because he's
[1:34:00] wonderful well I knew that message
[1:34:02] wasn't going to provoke everyone to
[1:34:04] dance but in that moment it was my hope
[1:34:08] that it would provoke somebody to do
[1:34:10] something a little more than what they
[1:34:12] had done for over a year only we can
[1:34:15] hope only we can hope that as the word
[1:34:18] Goes Forth it catches us where we are
[1:34:21] and we respond to it from where we are
[1:34:24] and God lifts us High you can't respond
[1:34:27] to the word on a different level than
[1:34:28] the one you're walking on but if you
[1:34:30] will respond to the word on the level
[1:34:32] that you have have the level where you
[1:34:34] are God knows how to lift you to a
[1:34:37] higher place I know what it means to
[1:34:40] keep washing someone's
[1:34:42] feet when you
[1:34:43] realize that they're not for you they're
[1:34:47] against you I want to pass that test
[1:34:50] again and again and and again and again
[1:34:52] and again and again and I want you to
[1:34:54] pass that test Jesus was about to serve
[1:34:57] someone who was going to betray him
[1:34:59] someone who was going to sell him out
[1:35:02] someone who would doubt his
[1:35:04] authenticity you see the only way that
[1:35:06] Judas was able to do what he did he had
[1:35:08] to believe that Jesus wasn't who he said
[1:35:10] he
[1:35:11] was there was nothing in Judas that
[1:35:14] could have forced him to do what he did
[1:35:16] had he believed that Jesus was who he
[1:35:18] said he was now brother brandom said
[1:35:20] that Judas was saved and that he uh had
[1:35:23] uh had healed the sick and he had done
[1:35:26] some other Miracles and and and had you
[1:35:29] know repented so to speak whatever it
[1:35:31] looked like in that day but brother
[1:35:33] benam said where he made his final
[1:35:35] mistake was that he didn't go all the
[1:35:37] way up to the upper room and receive the
[1:35:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost I cannot
[1:35:42] stress to you here and you out there the
[1:35:46] importance of having your own personal
[1:35:48] experience with the Holy Ghost it's the
[1:35:51] only thing that'll keep those Spirits
[1:35:53] out of your life and you can't get him
[1:35:57] and never come for a refilling you got
[1:36:00] to fill up and fill up and fill up and
[1:36:02] fill up he humbled himself brother
[1:36:05] brandom said he humiliated himself and
[1:36:09] if you look up that word humility you'll
[1:36:12] find that the root of humility is to
[1:36:14] humiliate in in Hebrew and Greek to
[1:36:18] humiliate when we think of the word
[1:36:20] humiliate it's like mocking someone to
[1:36:23] the to the extent that that they are
[1:36:27] destroyed to humiliate someone but the
[1:36:31] but the the original meaning of that
[1:36:34] word is really just to humble yourself
[1:36:37] to humiliate yourself in the message how
[1:36:39] can I overcome are you still with me I'm
[1:36:42] pushing through for you uh paragraph 100
[1:36:45] Jesus gave us the example how to do it
[1:36:48] now we want to know how to overcome
[1:36:51] Jesus told us how to do it see I want
[1:36:54] you to read the next word did you know
[1:36:56] that humility is the key to
[1:37:02] overcoming I'd rather hear your
[1:37:03] testimony than you hear
[1:37:07] mine I'd rather hear what God is doing
[1:37:09] for you than for you to ask what God's
[1:37:11] doing for me this is one of the ways
[1:37:13] that we humble ourselves come on now one
[1:37:16] of the ways that we humble oursel is to
[1:37:18] talk
[1:37:20] less
[1:37:21] and learn
[1:37:22] more isn't that right ministers have a
[1:37:26] time with that I know we do but we must
[1:37:28] learn are you here are you sure praise
[1:37:32] God I need a
[1:37:34] water thank you excuse
[1:37:37] me how do we overcome Jesus told us how
[1:37:40] to do it see
[1:37:42] humility he GED himself he took a towel
[1:37:45] he washed the disciples feet and wiped
[1:37:48] them the very think of it the very G God
[1:37:51] Of Heaven
[1:37:53] humiliated himself do you agree with
[1:37:56] that he said we don't want to be
[1:37:58] humiliated he said that's the reason why
[1:38:00] women thank you that's the reason why
[1:38:02] women don't want their hair to grow out
[1:38:04] see the reason they don't want to dress
[1:38:05] like ladies should dress like men don't
[1:38:08] want to see it's the same thing they
[1:38:10] don't brother bandom is teaching us that
[1:38:13] it's a lack of humility that has plunged
[1:38:16] the Pentecostal Church into
[1:38:20] worldliness
[1:38:22] the lack of humility produces
[1:38:25] pride and that's exactly the reason why
[1:38:28] the church world is in the condition
[1:38:31] that it's in today he said they get
[1:38:33] humiliated but Jesus constantly look who
[1:38:37] he was
[1:38:39] greatness he said I'm going to say
[1:38:41] something
[1:38:42] greatness humiliates itself greatness
[1:38:46] humbles
[1:38:48] itself
[1:38:50] greatness so this great bride this
[1:38:54] unbelievable predestinated chosen bride
[1:38:57] must never choose to walk in Bride Pride
[1:39:00] we must always choose to walk in
[1:39:02] humility even in a world around us that
[1:39:05] doesn't know their right hand from their
[1:39:06] left hand if you understand what I'm
[1:39:08] saying say Amen in a message called the
[1:39:11] worst sinner in the city Minneapolis
[1:39:14] Minnesota brother Brandon said becoming
[1:39:16] a foot washer taking the towel and
[1:39:20] guarded himself South and wash the
[1:39:22] disciples feet I I just picked somebody
[1:39:24] up uh someone think well well you know
[1:39:27] why don't we ever have a a foot washing
[1:39:29] well we don't ever have foot washing so
[1:39:31] we could never you know we could never
[1:39:33] really enter into the spirit of
[1:39:41] this you I want you to think on what
[1:39:43] you're
[1:39:45] thinking entering into the spirit of
[1:39:47] this is not you washing my feet in
[1:39:49] church once a month
[1:39:52] brother entering into the spirit of this
[1:39:54] is living this out every day of Our
[1:39:56] Lives washing one another's feet letting
[1:40:00] his pain be your pain her heartache be
[1:40:02] your
[1:40:04] heartache this is servant good becoming
[1:40:08] a foot washer he washed the disciples
[1:40:11] feet he said let him that's great among
[1:40:13] you be the servant of all that was his
[1:40:16] example but us today oh
[1:40:19] hostile
[1:40:23] just let me let me let me have a little
[1:40:25] water here while you think on being
[1:40:31] hostile yes sir I wouldn't stoop to that
[1:40:34] fellow
[1:40:35] though that old drunk you
[1:40:38] know I wouldn't have nothing to do with
[1:40:40] him
[1:40:41] hello oh I'm Dr Jones see he said that's
[1:40:46] the reason we're not getting
[1:40:48] anywhere that's the reason why our pull
[1:40:51] pits are weak that's the reason today we
[1:40:54] don't have signs and wonders in our
[1:40:56] churches that's the reason today we
[1:40:58] don't have an oldfashioned Revival
[1:41:01] because Saints have become hostile
[1:41:03] instead of
[1:41:05] humble the key to overcoming he said is
[1:41:11] humility he said that's the reason today
[1:41:13] we don't have the pull pits are weak
[1:41:15] that's the reason today we don't have
[1:41:17] signs and wonders in the church that's
[1:41:19] the reason today we don't have an old
[1:41:20] passion Revival we're thinking we're
[1:41:28] somebody who are you preaching to all of
[1:41:31] us we're thinking we're somebody when
[1:41:33] we're
[1:41:35] nothing we can't overcome in a trip to
[1:41:42] Walmart I know I can't that's why I
[1:41:44] don't
[1:41:48] go you see everything
[1:41:51] what you used to see in an insane asylum
[1:41:54] you now see at
[1:41:56] Walmart people are insane they're moving
[1:42:00] closer and closer to Insanity because
[1:42:03] the bride is moving closer and closer to
[1:42:05] Eternity and as the bride moves closer
[1:42:07] to Eternity the world is moving closer
[1:42:10] to Total Insanity that's what the
[1:42:12] prophet told us the Bible said when a
[1:42:14] man thinks him something when he's
[1:42:16] nothing he does
[1:42:18] what the greatest Among
[1:42:22] Us well I've been here for 30 years the
[1:42:25] greatest Among Us there's no spiritual
[1:42:27] pedigree here I love it I'm so thankful
[1:42:31] for everyone that come and
[1:42:33] stood that came and stayed but that
[1:42:37] alone doesn't make you higher that alone
[1:42:40] doesn't make you better than somebody
[1:42:45] else you might be here because you're
[1:42:47] too lazy to go somewhere
[1:42:49] else that wouldn't be it that wouldn't
[1:42:51] be the right reason would it but that's
[1:42:54] no reason to think you're anything let
[1:42:56] me tell you something when we start
[1:42:57] thinking we're
[1:42:59] something it's When God says I got to
[1:43:01] show
[1:43:02] him I'm going to have to let him see who
[1:43:05] he really is I'm going to have to put
[1:43:07] the mirror up so she get a good glance
[1:43:09] at who she really is he knows nothing
[1:43:11] that he ought to know this is Brother
[1:43:13] random he knows nothing that he ought to
[1:43:15] know and he ought to know that he's a
[1:43:19] sinner he's a
[1:43:22] sinner in pergamin uh uh pergan Church
[1:43:25] age brother bam says in paragraph 281 I
[1:43:28] hope this isn't too much reading because
[1:43:30] I got a lot more the way
[1:43:34] up I didn't hear you the Way Up Is Down
[1:43:39] everything's falling down around us but
[1:43:41] the bride's not going down did you hear
[1:43:43] the song the bride's not
[1:43:46] falling the bride may have to listen to
[1:43:49] lies and she may have to fight her away
[1:43:50] way through the lies and the enemy may
[1:43:52] have to have the bride may have to have
[1:43:54] a song sung to her to remind
[1:43:58] us that when we can't hold on any longer
[1:44:01] he'll never turn us loose come on the
[1:44:05] way up is not up the Way Up Is Down he
[1:44:09] that humbles himself shall be exalted he
[1:44:11] that exalts himself shall be abased
[1:44:14] humbled himself he said don't try to be
[1:44:16] a big something try to be a little
[1:44:19] something
[1:44:24] it is good but can we do
[1:44:26] it but be what you are see be little in
[1:44:31] the sight of God be little in your own
[1:44:33] sight everybody else is above you hello
[1:44:38] oh
[1:44:39] my who could be greater than Jesus
[1:44:42] Christ who guarded himself and wash the
[1:44:45] disciples feet a foot washing flunky he
[1:44:52] become the god of Heaven the creator of
[1:44:55] Heaven down from his glory Jesus laid
[1:44:58] aside his garments that's what we're
[1:45:00] preaching on the god of Heaven the
[1:45:02] creator of heavens and earth washing
[1:45:05] dirty feet for fishermen oh with manure
[1:45:08] and stuff and dust off the roads where
[1:45:11] their garments had swept it up and
[1:45:14] washing it off a foot washing
[1:45:19] flunky what he was and then we think
[1:45:23] we're somebody we got to be doctor PhD
[1:45:26] so and so oh my that ain't
[1:45:30] Christ they don't display the lovely
[1:45:32] Jesus Christ he becomes servant to all
[1:45:36] when you have to announce that you're a
[1:45:37] genuine servant of God I'm a genuine
[1:45:40] called preacher I'm a genuine Apostle
[1:45:43] I'm a genuine Prophet when you have to
[1:45:45] tell us who you
[1:45:49] are
[1:45:51] there's no humility in that that's Pride
[1:45:55] it's actually false Pride because it
[1:45:56] don't mean
[1:45:58] anything let me tell you something the
[1:46:00] fruit is where it's at not immature
[1:46:03] fruit like Hawke was praying about we
[1:46:05] got to come to the place where we
[1:46:06] squeeze out some real fruit some mature
[1:46:09] fruit amen you don't have to have it on
[1:46:12] your on your business
[1:46:14] card you don't have to have it engraved
[1:46:16] on your
[1:46:18] Bible you don't have to go around
[1:46:19] telling every every body what part of
[1:46:21] the five-fold ministry you fulfill let
[1:46:23] your ministry open doors for you let
[1:46:26] your testimony do the work let the
[1:46:28] spirit that's on your life draw others
[1:46:32] you'll be surprised how God will bring
[1:46:34] somebody to you to hear what you have to
[1:46:36] say if you can't preach out there you
[1:46:38] need to get your eyes off of up
[1:46:41] here just being honest I'm telling you
[1:46:44] what they preached to me when I was a
[1:46:45] boy coming along if you've got your eyes
[1:46:48] on this you're looking at the the wrong
[1:46:52] thing we've got to learn to serve out
[1:46:54] there we've got to learn to minister out
[1:46:56] there and we've got to learn to serve in
[1:46:58] here if we're called to Ministry we're
[1:47:00] called to Ministry in here so that we
[1:47:03] can Bust It Out Hallelujah take it right
[1:47:05] out of the walls right out to where it's
[1:47:07] at brother Shaw ain't that right that's
[1:47:10] what you do God bless you for it the god
[1:47:14] of Heaven the creator of Heaven and
[1:47:15] Earth washing dirty feet for fishermen
[1:47:17] manuring stuff and uh uh you got to be
[1:47:19] Dr PhD so and so uh that won't display
[1:47:23] lovely Jesus Christ that ain't Christ he
[1:47:25] becomes servant to all that's
[1:47:28] right he taught us as an example that we
[1:47:31] should do to one another as he did unto
[1:47:33] us oh that's my Lord what makes him big
[1:47:37] because he made himself
[1:47:39] little see that's what made him
[1:47:46] big when you get to liking someone's
[1:47:49] brag is a little bit too too
[1:47:51] much well we are all human everybody
[1:47:54] likes to be
[1:47:56] appreciated but if you're living off of
[1:47:58] those words of affirmation
[1:48:00] alone they'll
[1:48:03] fail remember words are fickle aren't
[1:48:06] they it's not what you're looking for
[1:48:08] you're you're you're not looking for
[1:48:09] just someone to say something nice about
[1:48:11] you you're looking for your faith to
[1:48:13] open the door you're looking for the
[1:48:15] word of God to ooze out of you in such a
[1:48:17] way that it's non-religious but most
[1:48:21] sincere you don't have to say hallelujah
[1:48:23] amen glory to God amen hallelujah thank
[1:48:25] you Jesus amen glory to God to be
[1:48:29] spiritual when I spoke in many
[1:48:31] conferences many many conferences around
[1:48:34] the world in the Pentecostal and
[1:48:36] charismatic world you would be surprised
[1:48:39] how many people I mean multitudes of
[1:48:41] people would come and introduce
[1:48:43] themselves to my wife and I and they
[1:48:45] would say I'm very
[1:48:49] spiritual
[1:48:52] I I just want to introduce myself I'm so
[1:48:54] and so and so and so and I'm called to
[1:48:55] do such and such and such and I'm very
[1:49:00] spiritual the first few times that was
[1:49:02] said to me I said oh
[1:49:04] really just like that oh
[1:49:07] really until I couldn't take it
[1:49:10] anymore and I finally changed my
[1:49:12] strategy and I said you know what sister
[1:49:15] what I have found out is people who are
[1:49:17] truly spiritual don't have to introduce
[1:49:20] themselves as
[1:49:23] such because if you get among someone
[1:49:26] who is
[1:49:28] spiritual they'll recognize you by The
[1:49:30] Same Spirit you won't have to validate
[1:49:34] yourself vindicate
[1:49:36] yourself how many of you know I hear
[1:49:38] people all the time talking about
[1:49:40] brother brandom's Vindication gets on my
[1:49:42] nerves a little bit because he kept
[1:49:45] saying God doesn't vindicate a
[1:49:47] man that's right I'm going to say that
[1:49:49] again for for any streamer that might be
[1:49:51] straggling and you need to hear it one
[1:49:53] more time we always talk about brother
[1:49:56] brandom's Vindication by thus sayith the
[1:49:58] Lord coming to pass by Miracles that
[1:50:00] took place by discernment that was
[1:50:02] correct and we say oh my God was
[1:50:05] vindicating him how come that servant of
[1:50:07] the Lord didn't run around touting his
[1:50:10] Vindication how come he went around
[1:50:12] saying God doesn't vindicate a man he
[1:50:15] vindicates his word now they immediately
[1:50:18] go to the quote where they want to
[1:50:20] confuse Us by saying the messenger and
[1:50:22] the message are the same well I want you
[1:50:25] to know something by Brother brandom's
[1:50:26] own definition the message is not
[1:50:28] William brandom by his own definition
[1:50:31] the message is the revelation of the
[1:50:34] Lord Jesus
[1:50:36] Christ and the only way Jesus can be
[1:50:39] revealed is for William brandom to get
[1:50:41] out of the way the only way for Jesus to
[1:50:44] be revealed in you is for you to get out
[1:50:45] of the way the only way for him to be
[1:50:48] revealed in me is to find Grace to be
[1:50:50] able to step out of the
[1:50:53] way are you with
[1:50:55] me oh my that didn't hit so
[1:50:59] well we might have to back up and hit
[1:51:01] that one
[1:51:03] again now I want you to know this wasn't
[1:51:05] the only time the Bible talks about
[1:51:07] Jesus or God humbling himself I want to
[1:51:10] read for you nine verses of Psalms 113 I
[1:51:13] I know that uh uh this may not have
[1:51:16] piqued your interest yet but stay with
[1:51:18] me would you I want to get this
[1:51:20] out praise ye the Lord Praise oh ye
[1:51:24] Servants of the Lord praise the name of
[1:51:26] the Lord this is David all the Psalms
[1:51:28] are not attributed to David but this is
[1:51:30] David blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:51:33] from this time forth and forever more
[1:51:37] from the rising of the sun until the
[1:51:39] going down of the same the lord's
[1:51:45] name not incessant testimonies of what
[1:51:48] God has done in me
[1:51:50] wow it's all right to share testimonies
[1:51:53] if we're pointing to the Lord but the
[1:51:56] same can be accomplished by lifting him
[1:51:58] up from the rising of the sun and the
[1:52:01] going down of the same the lord's name
[1:52:03] is to be praised are you here it's to be
[1:52:07] pray the Lord is high above all
[1:52:10] nations and His glory above the
[1:52:15] heavens who is like unto the Lord Our
[1:52:17] God who dwelleth on high
[1:52:21] who humbleth listen who humbleth himself
[1:52:25] to behold the things that are in heaven
[1:52:28] and in the
[1:52:30] earth God Is So lifted in glory god is
[1:52:33] so high in glory that if God is going to
[1:52:36] look into the heavens he has to come
[1:52:37] down to see
[1:52:39] it you hear what David said he's high
[1:52:42] above the Earth he's high above the
[1:52:44] heavens yet he humbleth himself to be
[1:52:47] able to look into the heavens he has to
[1:52:49] come down to see what's in the Earth
[1:52:52] this is this is a condescension isn't it
[1:52:54] this is down from his glory this is
[1:52:57] Jesus laying aside the Splendor that he
[1:52:59] had with the Father the glory that he
[1:53:01] had with the father hello let's go
[1:53:05] on he he raiseth up the poor listen to
[1:53:08] this he raiseth up the poor Out of the
[1:53:09] Dust he humbles himself to come down and
[1:53:12] once he gets here what does he do he
[1:53:14] ministers he raiseth up the poor Out of
[1:53:16] the Dust and lifteth the needy out of
[1:53:18] the dungill can anybody say Amen have
[1:53:21] you ever spent any time in the dung
[1:53:23] Hill every one of us were there every
[1:53:27] one of us were in the dust every one of
[1:53:29] us were in the dung Hill when he found
[1:53:31] us we didn't find the Lord the Lord
[1:53:34] found us that he may set him with
[1:53:37] princes who the
[1:53:40] poor that he may set him with princes
[1:53:43] even with the princes of his people he
[1:53:47] maketh the barren woman listen he maketh
[1:53:50] a barren woman to keep
[1:53:57] house there's a key
[1:54:00] here a woman who can't bear children of
[1:54:03] her own but she continues to Faithfully
[1:54:07] serve the house Faithfully serve her
[1:54:10] husband there's a conjunction here
[1:54:12] that's pretty powerful he maketh the
[1:54:15] barren woman to keep house and to
[1:54:17] be a joyful mother of children now how
[1:54:21] can you be a barren
[1:54:24] woman and be a mother of children at the
[1:54:26] same time well on the on the level if
[1:54:29] you look at this in the original you
[1:54:31] take the first the first surface level
[1:54:33] you can be a mother to other people's
[1:54:34] children you can love other children you
[1:54:37] can favor other people's children you
[1:54:39] can show your love as a mother to
[1:54:41] someone else's child not taking their
[1:54:43] place but
[1:54:46] supplementing serving as an accessory to
[1:54:49] help that woman but if you take this to
[1:54:51] the very original and go right back into
[1:54:53] the original it's saying more than to be
[1:54:55] a joyful mother of someone else's
[1:54:57] children it means if a woman who's
[1:54:59] Barren is keeping the house that it said
[1:55:02] let's read it again he said he maketh
[1:55:03] the barren woman to keep house and to be
[1:55:05] a joyful mother of
[1:55:08] children Praise You the lord it's
[1:55:10] prophetic how many of you know what that
[1:55:12] means it's prophetic by serving
[1:55:17] others he that bringeth a cup of water
[1:55:20] a cold water to a prophet in the name of
[1:55:22] a prophet shall
[1:55:25] receive Psalm uh Psalm 18 and and 35 in
[1:55:29] the Amplified says you have also given
[1:55:32] me the shield of your salvation and your
[1:55:35] right hand Hallelujah has held me up
[1:55:39] your gentleness this is Psalm 18:35 in
[1:55:42] the Amplified your
[1:55:45] gentleness and
[1:55:47] condescension have made me great leak
[1:55:50] let's see if you can find that honey I
[1:55:53] want him to take a look at it it gives
[1:55:54] me a good place for water break did we
[1:55:56] miss that one somehow it's okay if we
[1:56:01] did Mark it
[1:56:04] down put it in your Bible mark it down
[1:56:07] you have also given me the shield of
[1:56:10] your salvation and your right hand has
[1:56:14] held me up has anybody ever experienced
[1:56:16] The Shield of the Lord's
[1:56:18] salvation blocking the enemy on your
[1:56:20] behalf has anybody ever experienced the
[1:56:22] Lord's right hand of power and authority
[1:56:25] holding you up when it looked like you
[1:56:27] were going under for the last time
[1:56:28] anybody with me and then I want you to
[1:56:31] hear this phrase right here I wish we
[1:56:32] could see it this phrase is so beautiful
[1:56:34] to me your
[1:56:36] gentleness and
[1:56:39] condescension thank you
[1:56:47] have the Mighty God
[1:56:51] did not make me great in his
[1:56:55] mightiness it was his
[1:56:58] gentleness that made me great it was the
[1:57:01] fact that he condescended that he came
[1:57:04] down down from his glory he stepped away
[1:57:08] from his Splendor it's because of that
[1:57:11] that you and I have been made saved we
[1:57:14] have been made redeemed we have been
[1:57:16] made great do you see that everything
[1:57:18] about our ESS is directly tied to his
[1:57:21] coming down from Glory his
[1:57:26] condescension I appreciate that John uh
[1:57:29] 1 you know this but let me read it to
[1:57:32] you John 1 1 through3 and the Amplified
[1:57:36] since you're so familiar with it in the
[1:57:37] King James he said in the beginning
[1:57:39] before all time was the word Christ and
[1:57:42] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:57:45] God himself and he references Isaiah 9
[1:57:48] and6 he was present originally with God
[1:57:51] does anybody believe that all things
[1:57:55] were made and came into existence
[1:57:57] through him Christ the word and without
[1:58:01] him was not even one thing made that has
[1:58:05] come into being and in John 1:14 in the
[1:58:09] Amplified it says and the word
[1:58:12] Christ became flesh human incarnate and
[1:58:16] Tabernacle fixed his tent of Flesh lived
[1:58:19] a while among us and we actually saw his
[1:58:22] glory his honor his majesty why because
[1:58:25] he brought it down to us such Glory as
[1:58:28] an only begotten son receives from his
[1:58:30] father full of grace favor loving
[1:58:33] kindness and Truth isn't that powerful
[1:58:36] Amen in a message perfect strength by
[1:58:38] Perfect weakness brother brandham says
[1:58:41] in paragraph 3:19 and their Jesus had
[1:58:45] been stood against the evil stood
[1:58:48] against those AR organizations stood
[1:58:51] against those Pharisees and become
[1:58:54] weak and submitted himself what help me
[1:58:58] now un death and died like a
[1:59:02] sinner died like a sinner on the cross
[1:59:07] bearing he who knew no
[1:59:09] sin yet he died there on the cross
[1:59:12] bearing our sins let's go on the very
[1:59:15] Psalms the very prophets that they
[1:59:17] believed in had quoted hundreds of years
[1:59:19] before for the very words that he said
[1:59:21] at Calvary and they failed to see it my
[1:59:24] God said David my
[1:59:27] God why hast Thou forsaken me Psalm 22
[1:59:32] all my bones they stare at me not one of
[1:59:34] them is broke they wag their head and
[1:59:36] say he trusted in others he saved
[1:59:38] himself himself he can't save and all
[1:59:40] the things that the prophets had said
[1:59:42] was right there in front of them you
[1:59:45] hear that don't you as he hung there on
[1:59:47] the cross it was all hanging right right
[1:59:49] there in front of them and Jesus dying
[1:59:52] holding that word submitted himself God
[1:59:56] Emmanuel became so weak yes he came down
[2:00:01] from his glory he became so weak that he
[2:00:04] submitted himself to the death and to
[2:00:07] the grave and his soul to
[2:00:11] Hell
[2:00:13] remember and brother brandom screams
[2:00:15] with an exclamation
[2:00:18] weakness
[2:00:20] what is the message title perfect
[2:00:23] strength by
[2:00:26] Perfect weakness he's pointing to our
[2:00:29] example but out of that complete
[2:00:31] surrender come came forth on that Easter
[2:00:34] morning winding its way from the
[2:00:37] lowest he was the highest and did what
[2:00:42] become the lowest he come to the lowest
[2:00:44] people that's why you're
[2:00:47] here so your
[2:00:50] Shepherds it's us he come to the lowest
[2:00:54] people he went to the lowest city and
[2:00:56] the littlest man in the
[2:00:58] town had to look down on him you
[2:01:01] remember don't you from a tree went from
[2:01:05] there to death and from death to the
[2:01:07] grave and from grave to hell to the
[2:01:09] lowest that that could be got to the
[2:01:11] lowest hell that he could thought of he
[2:01:13] went into it he went to it but then from
[2:01:17] there God began to do
[2:01:20] what remember I would not suffer my Holy
[2:01:23] One to see corruption he wouldn't leave
[2:01:25] him in the bowels of hell if you and I
[2:01:27] humble ourselves God will not leave us
[2:01:30] in the dust if we will humble ourselves
[2:01:33] God will not leave us in the dust he
[2:01:35] will not leave us weak if we see how
[2:01:39] weak we can become In the Flesh in the
[2:01:41] in our own strength he will raise us up
[2:01:44] with his perfect strength every time
[2:01:47] every time every time every every time
[2:01:50] but then from there God began to raise
[2:01:51] him up through Paradise from there to
[2:01:53] the tomb and from the tomb to glory and
[2:01:55] so high that he had to look down to see
[2:01:59] Heaven exalted his Thrones in the heaven
[2:02:02] oh we're blessed we're so blessed we're
[2:02:06] so blessed let's go to the next one
[2:02:07] quickly uh forsaking all Tempe he gave
[2:02:11] up his
[2:02:12] sunship I want you to think on this just
[2:02:14] a moment down from his glory he gave up
[2:02:17] his sunship between him and the father
[2:02:21] to be
[2:02:22] made are you reading to be made sin for
[2:02:27] who did you know that he know no sin
[2:02:30] became sin for us our sins was placed
[2:02:34] upon him he gave up the
[2:02:38] sunship to become
[2:02:41] sin now he
[2:02:46] can he became as a sinner
[2:02:49] so that he could make Sinners
[2:02:52] Sons that's the
[2:02:54] story that's the story don't leave him
[2:02:58] in a
[2:02:59] Manger remember that he grew up he had a
[2:03:03] purpose more than just being coed
[2:03:06] over more than just receiving Gifts of
[2:03:09] frankincense and gold and myr he had a
[2:03:11] job to do
[2:03:15] Hallelujah now he takes Sinners and
[2:03:17] makes Sons out of them amen what a
[2:03:19] privilege yes sir now he gave his
[2:03:21] strength he became
[2:03:25] weak let's go
[2:03:27] on paragraph
[2:03:29] 153 now sir yes sir he gave his strength
[2:03:34] he became weak that he might be our
[2:03:37] strength he
[2:03:41] is can you all read that like you mean
[2:03:44] it you all remind me of elas when he
[2:03:47] first
[2:03:47] started
[2:03:49] can you all read that like you know what
[2:03:51] it says he became weak that he might be
[2:03:55] our strength let's read this part
[2:03:57] together he is our all sufficient
[2:04:01] strength praise God we don't need no
[2:04:05] other strength but the strength of the
[2:04:06] Lord Jesus he is my strength from day to
[2:04:09] day without him I would fall said the
[2:04:11] poet how
[2:04:14] wonderful how wonderful now I want you
[2:04:16] to look at this before we move to close
[2:04:20] in a bit 2 Corinthians
[2:04:23] 5117 and 18 let's study this carefully
[2:04:26] here
[2:04:27] therefore If any man be in Christ he is
[2:04:32] a this is why he came
[2:04:35] down to make Saints out of Sinners to
[2:04:38] make Sons out of Sinners come on he come
[2:04:42] to make Sons out of
[2:04:43] slaves didn't he do it therefore If any
[2:04:46] man be in Christ he's a new creature
[2:04:48] doesn't doesn't matter what he's done
[2:04:50] he's now a new creature old things are
[2:04:52] what and behold all things are become
[2:04:56] new now let's look at this and all
[2:04:57] things are of
[2:04:59] God who hath this is an important word
[2:05:02] let me hear you say this word
[2:05:05] reconciled
[2:05:06] us to himself by Jesus Christ and
[2:05:11] because of that hath given to us the
[2:05:15] ministry of
[2:05:17] reconciliation now that word reconcil
[2:05:20] there in the beginning of that verse is
[2:05:22] a word that means to
[2:05:25] [Music]
[2:05:26] exchange it means to buy
[2:05:30] back it means to return favor to does
[2:05:35] that say anything to you and then the
[2:05:38] word reconciliation that's what you're
[2:05:40] called to do is to restore the Divine
[2:05:44] favor to
[2:05:46] reestablish and interrupted or broken
[2:05:51] relationship because God returned favor
[2:05:55] to our lives by coming down from his
[2:05:57] glory yes he returned favor to our lives
[2:06:01] and because of that he gives us the
[2:06:04] grace as you've seen me do Jesus said
[2:06:07] this do you to one another he returns
[2:06:10] the grace and calls us to be ministers
[2:06:13] of reconciliation to do what to heal
[2:06:16] broken relationships most importantly
[2:06:19] that one that's between the man and his
[2:06:22] God the woman and her God we don't just
[2:06:25] get saved to be saved we're not just
[2:06:28] redeemed to be redeemed we're actually
[2:06:30] redeemed to be
[2:06:32] redeemers that's not taking anything
[2:06:34] away from the Christ that's giving
[2:06:36] Christ to the people and that's the
[2:06:38] responsibility of the Bride if you
[2:06:41] believe that say Amen verse 19 of the
[2:06:43] same chapter says to ITT that God was in
[2:06:47] Christ reconciling the world unto
[2:06:50] himself not imputing their trespasses
[2:06:53] unto them and hath committed unto us I'd
[2:06:57] like for you to read
[2:07:00] that that's the authority of the
[2:07:07] Bride the bride has Authority in
[2:07:14] reconciliation in the message living
[2:07:16] dying buried rising and coming
[2:07:19] paragraph 30 I'm just going to leave you
[2:07:20] to
[2:07:21] think brother brandom said' whatat a
[2:07:23] terrible thing that sin does it
[2:07:25] separates man from God and he was the
[2:07:27] sin offering that had to be offered for
[2:07:28] our sins and he was separated from the
[2:07:31] presence of God sin had separated him
[2:07:33] God placed our sins upon him and he was
[2:07:37] separated from God and that's why he
[2:07:39] cried why hast Thou forsaken
[2:07:43] me and because he was Forsaken and had
[2:07:46] taken this place and seen his people
[2:07:49] remember he saw his seed that he was
[2:07:52] come to be their Savior and to offer
[2:07:54] them life they had rejected him and it
[2:07:57] grieved him so till he was so
[2:08:00] brokenhearted until the blood and water
[2:08:02] and the chemicals of his body
[2:08:05] separated according to the
[2:08:08] description of the scripture and the
[2:08:11] examination of the Roman crucifixion his
[2:08:13] pericardium
[2:08:15] burst the sack that holds
[2:08:19] heart the fluid filled sack that
[2:08:23] protected his heart burst underneath the
[2:08:26] weight of the load and not only did
[2:08:28] Blood run through his body loose but so
[2:08:32] did water so that when the when the
[2:08:35] soldier came and took the spear and
[2:08:38] pushed it into his side some some people
[2:08:40] assume that was the empting of the
[2:08:42] bladder it had nothing to do with the
[2:08:44] bladder whatsoever it was the water that
[2:08:46] come out of the pericardium it was the
[2:08:49] heart's water the water that protects
[2:08:51] the heart and the blood and that issue
[2:08:54] had gone all the way through his body
[2:08:55] how many of you know you can't live long
[2:08:57] with that kind of thing happening
[2:08:59] filling up with blood and now
[2:09:01] fluid the the soldier thrust this spear
[2:09:05] into his side and blood blood and water
[2:09:07] come rushing out and the prophet tells
[2:09:09] us this was the bride being separated
[2:09:12] from her
[2:09:13] bridegroom he said in the same manner
[2:09:15] that Eve was taken from Adam the bride
[2:09:18] was separated from
[2:09:20] Christ that day hello that day on
[2:09:23] Calvary aren't we a blessed people oh
[2:09:27] yes we are yes we are all right and
[2:09:30] because he was forsaken did we finish
[2:09:32] that yes blood and water and the
[2:09:34] chemicals of his body separated now one
[2:09:36] more show us the father in Zurich he
[2:09:39] said now when he was here on Earth he
[2:09:42] said he was God he acted like God he
[2:09:46] preached like God he he healed like
[2:09:53] God but he died like a
[2:09:56] man my father my
[2:09:59] father why hast Thou forsaken
[2:10:01] me but he raised
[2:10:06] again like God God was in Christ
[2:10:10] reconciling the world to himself do you
[2:10:12] believe that I said do you believe that
[2:10:16] now let's move on to one more here for
[2:10:17] just a moment moment in a conference
[2:10:19] with God I'm going to skip a whole lot
[2:10:21] of scripture here but I'll come back to
[2:10:22] some of it before we are done in
[2:10:24] paragraph
[2:10:27] 122 uh of the message conference with
[2:10:30] God God dwells in humility not in
[2:10:34] PP that's always been the devil's idea
[2:10:37] PP God comes in humility he said that'll
[2:10:41] be a sign not a Lesser God but a man a
[2:10:45] man he cried like a baby when he was a
[2:10:47] baby he played in the streets like a boy
[2:10:51] when he was a boy do you hear this God
[2:10:55] in flesh the word in a body cried when
[2:10:58] he was a
[2:11:00] baby he had a poopy
[2:11:06] diaper you don't know what that does for
[2:11:08] me somebody said well brother I mean it
[2:11:10] doesn't take much to Thrill you does it
[2:11:12] that really Thrills me it Thrills me
[2:11:16] that he was in every way a man
[2:11:19] in every way a human being and yet
[2:11:22] God he worked in the carpenter shop with
[2:11:25] Joseph as a man at work he eat when he
[2:11:27] was hungry he sweated when he was hot he
[2:11:29] cried when he was
[2:11:31] sorrowful he was a man do you hear that
[2:11:35] this will be a sign to you God will
[2:11:37] dwell with you not a great big upy up
[2:11:40] man but a little low man with no
[2:11:42] background a sign that's a death stroke
[2:11:46] to the devil right there amen a lowly
[2:11:50] man he goes on that's a Deathstroke to
[2:11:53] every denomination and Pomp and all
[2:11:57] pumping Glory of this world it's a death
[2:11:59] stroke that the god of Heaven
[2:12:02] chose he could have come any way he
[2:12:04] wanted to come but he chose to come that
[2:12:08] way that's what happened at the
[2:12:10] conference it had to be decided that's
[2:12:13] the way he chose to come he didn't have
[2:12:15] to come that way he was the god of
[2:12:17] heaven but he chose to come as a baby
[2:12:19] down from his glory he chose to come
[2:12:21] that way that's what happened at that
[2:12:23] conference in heaven let me just call
[2:12:25] another under two conferences here he's
[2:12:27] preaching on that message conferences he
[2:12:29] said there was a time after a perfect
[2:12:31] life of 33 and a half years had been
[2:12:33] lived a man who wanted to live as much
[2:12:35] as I want to live as much as you want to
[2:12:37] live a man who had something to live
[2:12:42] for Brethren that he loved people that
[2:12:46] he loved sunsets that he like to
[2:12:49] see remember Jesus was a man God was in
[2:12:53] him there come a time when the spirit
[2:12:56] that was leading the lamb the dove oh
[2:13:00] yes now we're getting to something there
[2:13:02] had to be a conference between the lamb
[2:13:04] and the Dove and they formed a place to
[2:13:06] set it after the supper that night they
[2:13:08] crossed over a little brook cherith or
[2:13:10] somewhere and went across a brook and
[2:13:12] went into a garden called Gethsemane now
[2:13:15] that wouldn't have been the brook of
[2:13:16] cherith but you get the point
[2:13:18] they had to have a conference God and
[2:13:21] Christ had to talk it over the lamb and
[2:13:24] the dove had to sit together it was the
[2:13:26] dove that had to talk to the lamb and it
[2:13:28] was the Lamb's death powerful powerful
[2:13:32] now when they sat by that rock and all
[2:13:34] the Angels come down from heaven to
[2:13:36] listen in to this conference oh there
[2:13:38] was Gabriel Michael woodworm all the
[2:13:40] thousands of them sitting around the
[2:13:44] rock now that's a pretty powerful
[2:13:46] description but a very powerful thing
[2:13:49] was about to happen wasn't
[2:13:53] it I'm so thankful for that one more
[2:13:56] Perfection paragraph 52 even on a stormy
[2:14:00] night the birds had Nest the foxes had
[2:14:04] holes but I don't even have a place to
[2:14:06] lay my head the highest of all heavens
[2:14:09] of Heaven become the lowest of all those
[2:14:12] even to animal life was privileged to
[2:14:15] him above him as far as comfort of life
[2:14:19] not only that but in his death he
[2:14:22] suffered to death like no one ever
[2:14:25] suffered never in man ever suffered with
[2:14:27] such a broken heart till his blood and
[2:14:29] water
[2:14:31] separated before his death the last one
[2:14:35] along these this line paragraph 30 of
[2:14:38] living dying buried Rising coming he
[2:14:40] said what a terrible thing that sin does
[2:14:43] it separates man from God and he was the
[2:14:46] sin offering that had to be offered for
[2:14:48] our sins and he was separated from the
[2:14:50] presence of God sin had separated him
[2:14:54] God placed our sins upon him and he was
[2:14:57] separated from God and that's why he
[2:15:00] cried
[2:15:01] why hast Thou forsaken me this isn't
[2:15:05] poetic this is literal The God Who Lived
[2:15:09] the word who lived in him had to leave
[2:15:12] him God can't die God can't be
[2:15:16] crucified God had to withdraw himself
[2:15:20] from his own son so that his son could
[2:15:23] die in the flesh somebody said then how
[2:15:26] could it be Redemption because the blood
[2:15:29] that was in him was not of this Earth it
[2:15:33] wasn't of Joseph it wasn't of Mary it
[2:15:37] was God's Redemptive blood created for
[2:15:41] Redemption sin had separated him placed
[2:15:44] our sins upon him he was separated from
[2:15:46] God and that's why cried why hast Thou
[2:15:49] forsaken me go on and because he was
[2:15:53] Forsaken and had taken this place and
[2:15:56] seen his people he was come to be their
[2:15:58] Savior and to offer them life they had
[2:16:01] rejected him and it grieved him so till
[2:16:03] he was so brokenhearted until the blood
[2:16:06] and water what we just read a moment ago
[2:16:07] and the chemicals of his body
[2:16:12] separated now I want to give you one
[2:16:14] more verse and I'm going to close
[2:16:19] Hebrews
[2:16:20] 4 verse
[2:16:23] 14-6 seeing then we have a great high
[2:16:28] priest thank you Jesus that is passed
[2:16:31] into the heavens Jesus the son of God
[2:16:34] let us hold fast our profession for we
[2:16:38] have not a high priest which cannot be
[2:16:39] touched with the feeling of our
[2:16:41] infirmities but was in all points
[2:16:42] tempted hello sir as we are like as we
[2:16:47] are
[2:16:48] read the
[2:16:49] rest let us therefore do what come
[2:16:53] boldly unto the throne of grace that we
[2:16:55] may obtain mercy and find Grace to help
[2:16:57] in time of need I have to read one more
[2:16:59] I I I apologize Philippians 2 5 and 8
[2:17:03] let this mind be in you which was also
[2:17:06] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[2:17:09] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[2:17:11] with God but made himself
[2:17:15] of now that scripture verse there where
[2:17:17] says being made in the form of God
[2:17:19] that's where brother brandham gets the
[2:17:20] Greek word
[2:17:21] morphe and he added the preposition the
[2:17:23] Greek preposition to it and he called it
[2:17:26] inor which means in form I in form but
[2:17:29] it's e in in the Greek in Mor he took on
[2:17:33] the form remember the prophet explained
[2:17:36] that to us like the drama of a Greek
[2:17:39] Theater where the mask was changed the
[2:17:42] character was the same the actor was the
[2:17:45] same but in order to fulfill the role
[2:17:46] and play the part he had to change mask
[2:17:49] and that's where that word in morphe
[2:17:51] comes from one God one Spirit changing
[2:17:55] mask took upon him the form morphe of a
[2:18:00] servant and was made in the likeness of
[2:18:02] men that word reputation there is
[2:18:05] Kino like sister Megan's name
[2:18:09] Kino and it's from the word Greek word
[2:18:12] Kino and this is an important word it's
[2:18:14] from the Greek word Kino that we get the
[2:18:17] the the word or or or the theme
[2:18:21] kenosis and kenosis is the emptying of
[2:18:25] himself of all
[2:18:27] deity and that's what happened on the
[2:18:29] cross all that was of God had to leave
[2:18:33] him there so that he could die alone
[2:18:37] somebody said I don't understand how
[2:18:38] that could do anything for us what it
[2:18:40] actually does is it takes mortal
[2:18:43] men the old song that that the mamies
[2:18:46] used to sing my favorite song when I
[2:18:48] think about the birth of Christ says who
[2:18:50] do you think would believe such a
[2:18:54] thing who could believe that this story
[2:18:57] is
[2:18:58] true it says and the star one part of
[2:19:01] the second verse said and a star moved
[2:19:03] round in Heaven until it stopped right
[2:19:05] over them and some Shepherds said an
[2:19:08] angel came and told them about the birth
[2:19:11] listen this line they always
[2:19:13] knew that men went to heaven but now
[2:19:18] God had come to
[2:19:21] Earth The Inspirations used to sing it
[2:19:23] years ago The Wonder of
[2:19:27] Wonders oh how could it be that God
[2:19:30] became flesh and was given for me the
[2:19:34] almighty came down and walked among men

[2:21:21] thing in all the world if there is a
[2:21:23] town brave enough bold enough to put a a
[2:21:26] a a manger
[2:21:28] scene and then some little Thug will

[2:21:41] see that let me tell you something
[2:21:43] you've got more way more this world has
[2:21:45] got way more than a little baby on their
[2:21:48] hands oh yes they've got way more to
[2:21:51] answer for than what they do with a
[2:21:53] little baby in a Manger he's not in that
[2:21:55] manger anymore come on now this is this
[2:21:59] is the Story of All
[2:22:01] Seasons down from his glory that word
[2:22:05] Kino kenos or
[2:22:09] kenosis let me read you just a couple
[2:22:11] more quotes and I'm done I I won't feel
[2:22:13] I won't feel good if I don't and you may
[2:22:16] not be awake if I do but but I'm going
[2:22:17] to
[2:22:18] anyway adoption number two he said when
[2:22:21] he last cried Ella Ella my God my God
[2:22:26] that was a
[2:22:28] man why hast Thou forsaken me in the
[2:22:32] Garden of Gethsemane the anointing left
[2:22:34] him you know he had to die as a
[2:22:39] sinner he died a sinner you know that
[2:22:42] not his sins but mine and yours that's
[2:22:45] where that love come in how he took mine
[2:22:48] oh hallelujah how he took mine and then
[2:22:52] the unveiling of God this is
[2:22:54] beautiful paragraph 77 now when it's
[2:22:57] said there that he emptied himself or
[2:23:00] poured
[2:23:03] out it actually said in in in King James
[2:23:07] made himself of no
[2:23:10] reputation the meaning of it he emptied
[2:23:12] himself he poured out now we would think
[2:23:15] like this that he vomit uh the English
[2:23:18] word of emptied or poured out from him
[2:23:20] see something went out of him that was
[2:23:23] different from him and that would be in
[2:23:25] the
[2:23:27] flesh he goes
[2:23:33] on but the word kinos in the Greek does
[2:23:37] not mean that he vomit up or his arm
[2:23:41] went off or his eye went out another
[2:23:44] person it means that is he changed
[2:23:48] himself he poured himself into amen into
[2:23:52] another Mass into another form not
[2:23:55] another person went out of him called
[2:23:58] the Holy Spirit but it was he
[2:24:01] himself you get it and we do get it he
[2:24:04] himself poured himself into the people
[2:24:06] Christ in you how beautiful how
[2:24:08] wonderful to think God pouring himself
[2:24:10] into a human being into the believer
[2:24:12] pour out it was a part of the drama to
[2:24:14] do so God all the fullness oh the
[2:24:17] godhead bodily was in this person Jesus
[2:24:20] Christ he was God and God Alone not a
[2:24:23] third person or a second person or a
[2:24:25] first person but the
[2:24:27] person God revealed or veiled excuse me
[2:24:31] in human flesh and in the same message
[2:24:34] paragraph 238 and 39 notice all the
[2:24:37] glory musicians come all the glory that
[2:24:40] is in God is in this word all the
[2:24:43] blessings that's in God is in this word
[2:24:46] or in the the word it's hid to the
[2:24:48] unbeliever by
[2:24:53] what not not wrong something wrong with
[2:24:57] every tradition but there are Traditions
[2:25:00] that cause us to look in the wrong
[2:25:03] direction I'm going to slow
[2:25:05] down there are Traditions that cause us
[2:25:08] to look in the wrong
[2:25:15] direction someone posted
[2:25:18] today early this morning a picture of
[2:25:20] their little
[2:25:22] grandbaby putting the star on top of the
[2:25:26] tree and the caption we don't celebrate
[2:25:30] Christmas but we put little trees up for
[2:25:32] the
[2:25:38] kitties some people are
[2:25:41] unbelieving by their
[2:25:45] Traditions there are some Traditions
[2:25:47] that may take us toward Christ there are
[2:25:51] Holiness there are certain aspects of
[2:25:53] our personal walk of Holiness the way we
[2:25:58] dress that are not particularly sin
[2:26:02] issues but there are Traditions that we
[2:26:04] carry on because we believe that it
[2:26:06] draws us closer and makes us another
[2:26:09] example a greater example to the world
[2:26:11] around us people come and ask us where
[2:26:13] we go to church and where we worship
[2:26:15] because they can see that we take it
[2:26:16] seriously enough to change our
[2:26:19] Traditions anybody with me but I'm
[2:26:22] thinking to myself is this really what
[2:26:25] brother random me meant when he said
[2:26:27] these things are for the
[2:26:29] kitties was he really telling us that
[2:26:33] there's anything to take out of that
[2:26:36] tradition that causes someone to see
[2:26:38] Christ it doesn't it
[2:26:41] doesn't if we want to reveal Christ we
[2:26:43] reveal him in our own
[2:26:45] lives hello
[2:26:47] and we reveal him by by moving through
[2:26:49] his death and
[2:26:51] Resurrection come on now he said all
[2:26:54] that God was he emptied
[2:26:56] himself it's all in Christ all that God
[2:26:59] was he emptied himself kenos and came
[2:27:01] into Christ and we into Christ are
[2:27:05] where is that where you want to be folks
[2:27:08] he said well I'm into Christ you say and
[2:27:10] then believe there's three Gods baptized
[2:27:12] in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost
[2:27:14] believe in all these traditions and
[2:27:15] things that you believe in of the know
[2:27:17] you're still behind the veil see come

[2:42:18] perfect leadership will
[2:42:21] come not by the words of men or women
[2:42:25] but by the holy spirit that perfect
[2:42:28] leadership would come right now and I
[2:42:30] know that I know that I know that I know
[2:42:32] that I
[2:42:33] know would spring up within

[2:48:37] we are not going to have a service here
[2:48:39] on Tuesday night we're going to give
[2:48:42] this an opportunity to uh to die
[2:48:46] hopefully uh I feel like I'm fighting
[2:48:48] myself this morning and I'm not going to
[2:48:51] have it how many of you are not going to
[2:48:54] have it but I don't want to do anything
[2:48:57] that jeopardizes babies or or our older
[2:48:59] ones and I I really want God to do
[2:49:02] something for us
[2:49:03] Sunday we're going to have a great
[2:49:05] singer with us to help sing to us and
[2:49:08] looks like and uh some special friends
[2:49:11] of ours that I've wanted you all to meet
[2:49:13] them some Of You' have met them but some
[2:49:15] of you have not and I've wanted you to
[2:49:16] meet them for a long time and I don't
[2:49:19] know what God's going to do next Sunday
[2:49:20] but he's going to do
[2:49:22] something I know he is so if you will uh
[2:49:25] if you will not be offended then we will
[2:49:27] not have a service here Tuesday night
[2:49:29] you have the app you've got the
[2:49:31] prophet's messages you've got access to
[2:49:33] the word you you shouldn't have any
[2:49:35] problem finding something to feed on a't
[2:49:38] God good to
[2:49:39] us I had originally told some of the
[2:49:42] young brothers that I would meet with
[2:49:43] them on Thursday evening of this week
[2:49:45] but I'm not going to do that either and
[2:49:47] the reason for that is because we're
[2:49:49] waiting to see what company is going to
[2:49:51] do and how things are going to work out
[2:49:54] and uh I just feel like that we'll we'll
[2:49:57] we will wait till the first of the year
[2:49:58] to do that so you young brothers that uh
[2:50:02] knew about it and and wanted to
[2:50:03] participate I hope you won't be
[2:50:05] disappointed but I really want to do it
[2:50:07] in the right timing of the Lord and uh
[2:50:10] just turns out that I don't think it
[2:50:12] will be this week father we are so
[2:50:15] grateful to be in your house
[2:50:18] today we are so thankful for what you
[2:50:20] did for us you came a mighty long way
[2:50:24] from Glory walked among men and paid the
[2:50:29] price became sin for our salvation and
[2:50:34] deliverance the least that we can do is
[2:50:36] praise you with everything that we've
[2:50:38] got and do our very best to surrender to
[2:50:41] your word in this late hour I ask ask
[2:50:44] you to watch over this body right now in
[2:50:47] the name of
[2:50:48] Jesus Lord I truly believe that you are
[2:50:52] the Divine healer and the great
[2:50:55] physician and it really hurts our hearts
[2:50:59] to see something like that moving from
[2:51:01] family to family we believe God that you
[2:51:04] can stop it at the
[2:51:07] root and so we're asking that you would
[2:51:10] build us up this week not only
[2:51:13] physically but also spirit spiritually
[2:51:15] and that you would watch over those who
[2:51:17] are traveling this
