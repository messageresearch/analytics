========================================
amen and then after the New Birth is the trial of your faith first Peter 1:7 in the Amplified so that the genuiness of your faith may be tested your faith which is infinitely more precious than the perishable gold which is tested and purified by fire this proving of your faith is intent intended to redem found to your praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ the Messiah the anointed one is revealed so all of this that you're going through the trial of your faith the proving of your faith it is intended so that when you are finished with this journey it is going to be that you have a great contribution to your praise and glory and honor when he is revealed revealed in his fullness now in Reading I have come to understand that gold does not exist in its purest form naturally The Ore is extracted from the earth and in that ore there are contaminants and then there are different ways to get the contaminants out of the gold uh and it is the way that they get it till that it gets to the highest level in my understanding 24 Karat being the purest of gold so in this mining process being mixed with impurities one of the ways that they refine this gold is to apply heat 1,9 48° fah Mighty hot I and I heard a minister a few weeks ago talking about gold and was talking about the refining process something that struck me he said you know the gold is not crying out stop the heat it's the impurities that are screaming stop the heat the gold says Crank It Up get all the impurities out the impurities are screaming whoa that's enough for right now take them it's too hot and when we get in the middle of the trial we the human part of us we can hardly stand the heat of this refining process but yet there's something deep down on the inside that's crying turn it up get it as hot as it needs to be I'm tired of this refining process let's get to the Purity hallelujah hallelujah AB
