their little bride is taken out of here and changed it's a reality it's not a fable it's not a myth it's a reality and only the righteous are going and none of us are righteous without him you can't live righteous enough amen you may be seated for just a moment moment again we're going to have you stand for the word to be read in a moment but it is wonderful to have you we we are certainly miss those that are not here today but we understand I want you to know that I'm not here today out of obligation or because I didn't get invited to be somewhere else I'm here today because I wanted to be here and I trust that's why you're here there's nowhere I'd rather be today than right here with you in the presence of the Lord and we have found out that we we just can't possibly attend every wedding that we're invited to if they're going to have them on the weekend and what better time to have them than the weekend and brother gy even they were invited we were invited he even said to me in my office uh I you go you go this time but I just didn't think that that's where I was supposed to be and it is so important in the last days to be where God would have you that's all that matters uh I agree with brother gley it's good to see Dawn uh in church today very good to see her and uh it's hard for me to imagine that she has a son now that little son that ran around here when he was younger now married it's hard to believe it really is but we're we're happy that he's happy and I know it's hard on Mom it's hard it's happy but it's hard I remember how my mom was but oh we're just thankful that God is taking care of us all and with his great tender care we're never alone when we have him his grace is sufficient for every trial that we face I think we've had plenty of singing um but I I will sing anyway um I'll sing uh Ben said maybe power in prayer so let's do that and uh I don't think we have to have another song but anyway we we don't have Cade to fall back on today he's busy uh they were having a wonderful service last night in North Carolina I didn't get to see but a tiny clip uh uh the the camera was not on the prayer line uh the deacons they said didn't think that the camera maybe should be on the prayer line when people came through and I understand that some people are a little bit uh you know shy about things like that but it sure is hard to be on the other end of something and not be able to see what the Lord is doing but we could see them when they came out of the prayer line and it was so wonderful to see Joseph I guess we're going to have to cut down on our JoJo calling him JoJo he's he's getting big now grown now and it was so wonderful to see Joseph come through the prayer line uh with tears on his running down his face and his eyes all red and his face all red touched by the Lord and that would make the trip there worth it and we're just thankful that he was touched and they certainly welcom Kate into back to his church where he was and and uh he was ministering there and and led the choir and so forth and we're thankful that God can use he'll use you wherever you are he'll use you if you if you go ready for him you believe there's power in prayer I do somewhere somebody is praying tonight for a loved one that's wandered away from the light Faith reaches heaven and God isw and forever is Chang with one moment of prayer oh there's power in prayer there is power to spare and all that you'll ever need is waiting right there just a few words words of little child's Faith then it's goodbye despair oh there's power so much power there's power in prayer yes there he is now a bed holds a body that is peral in pain and the doctors have tried but they said to Hope is in vain oh but wait somebody's praying in the midst of the Gloom and all at once that great physician he steps in into the room oh there's [Music] power power to spare and all that we will ever need is waiting right there just a few words of little child's faith then it's goodbye despair oh there's power so much power there's power in prayer do you believe that I believe the Lord Praise thank you amen thank God for the musicians wonderful wonderful to have sister Laurel back on the piano today we missed her and David back on the guitar again we're just blessed and thankful um we always miss those that aren't able to be with us let's all stand again for a moment we miss those who can't be here we sure do appreciate having them come back we're thankful for sister marbeth who did an amazing job and uh she has been out of the rotation for some time but we are so thankful to report that she is back in the rotation and won't just have to fill in but she will uh have her Sunday and Tuesday night too I want to give God praise when when uh it's Tove let me tell you why I want to praise the Lord for that it's Tove when we see someone this is what Tove means in Hebrew when we see someone bringing forth the seed of their Destiny God said that is Tove it's good it's Tove May it's very good he he also tells us in Hebrew that when we are not bringing forth the seed of our destiny what we were created to do that it's raw and somebody said well that must mean bad no it doesn't it actually means evil so God looks at it as evil when we are not bringing forth the seed of our destiny so when someone faces everything that they're going through in their life and they're willing to let God use them anyhow that's that's very Tove and we're so thankful for sister Mar Beth the gift that's in her life we're thankful that she has pressed through everything we're pressing you know there's an ining on our press we're pressing through and we're very very thankful and we're blessed to have Katie does a wonderful job on the organ and uh it's it's not having brother Steve of course it's not no one would ever be able to take his place he's making Heavenly music this morning but Cade certainly reminds me in many many ways uh of Brother Steve when he plays and we're just thankful to have him and and we miss him we've got a lot of talent here if they'll just step up and volunteer amen amen so this morning I want you to turn to the book of numbers and there's so much we could say my my bless every one of you who are streaming the service uh it's wonderful to know the Millers are out there on the other end of this and there's a brother greeting us from Pakistan uh God bless you brother and so many others let me see if I could just I saw some others here brother uh Ryder in Cape Town Indiana the Netherlands and so many more Sister Anne who's unable to go to church because her husband is ill and but she is listening to to our services and she believes in in this message and we're just thankful God bless you Sister Anne for being with us today Numbers Chapter 3 uh I'm missing some of my loudest amens this morning so I'm asking you to make up for them either with your amen or at least with your faith pool brother Robert's not here today and he has a good Hardy amen Austin Hodes is not here he has one of the best Hardy amens he gets in trouble sometime he's so loud and then I've got those of you but sometimes preachers need a little verbal help and that Dad don't that distract you most of the time it really helps me my granny used to say that when you say am man to a Holiness preacher it's like saying sium to a dog it just causes them to want to keep running so maybe that's why you don't amen cuz I'm so long- winded maybe that's what it is Numbers Chapter 13 Verse 1 through3 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying send thou men that they may search the land of Canaan which or Canan in Hebrew which I give unto the children of Israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man everyone a ruler among them and Moses by the Commandment of the Lord sent them from the will Wilderness of pan all those men were heads of the children of Israel let's catch up and make sure you follow there were 12 tribes there were Chiefs among all the 12 tribes there were leaders and among the leaders of all 12 tribes one man was elected nominated somehow to represent that entire tribe going over to Canaan land and spying out what was on the other side of the Jordan River do you understand and let's do one more and then you can be seated Numbers Chapter 13 same chapter verses 7-2 and Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan I I'm uh uh I I'm I'm in verse 17 I'm very very sorry you may not have pulled it up I see that I'm missing a one I'm in numbers 131 17- 20 my my bad honey I'm s sorry and Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said unto them get you up this way Southward and go up into the mountain Verse 18 and see the land what it is and the people that dwelleth therein whether they be strong or weak few or many you see the children of Israel had no idea what was on the other side all they knew is God said I'm giving you that land they didn't know if they were going to find many inhabitants or few inhabitants they didn't know what was waiting on them and what the land is and they that dwell in whether it be good or bad and what cities they be that they dwell in whether in tents or in strongholds and what the land is whether it be fat or lean whether there be wood therein or not and be ye of good courage and bring of the fruit of the land now the time was the time of first ripe grapes that's the early grapes father would you come now Lord as we study your word together this morning would you anoint our ears to hear it would you anoint your servant to teach it would you Lord let it spring up and root in our inner being that we can understand that these things are our examples that we also have a promised land to conquer we also have a promised inheritance and we must be faithful even as Moses was faithful and Joshua and Caleb we must follow their example and possess all that you have promised us strengthen us today keep us Alert in this hour and may the faithful of the people cause the word to Spring forth Among Us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said amen you may be seated so we are reading a familiar portion of scripture and I'm going to read a few more verses I know it gets a little mundane when there's so much reading but I want you to be reminded of the details and instead of just uh marking them off like little PowerPoints or something uh I want to read it to you right out of the word there's one thing we can't do too much and that is read God's word and pray you you believe that that that's what we're told and I believe it's nothing but the truth numbers 13 and verse 23 and now they have crossed they have gone over and they have come to the brook of eshkol and uh that word eshcol means the clustering of the grapes it means where the grapes are clustered so the Bible goes on to tell us and they came unto the brook of eshcol and cut down from then a Branch with one cluster of grapes and they bear it between two upon a staff and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs now I don't know about you I've seen some pretty big bunches of grapes we were uh helping along with Nathan there Harvest some grapes in Israel and there were beautiful clusters of of grapes that are made for wine they're extra juicy and they're about that tall can you imagine a cluster of grapes so large that it would take two men to carry it I'm telling you that is a you know that's a five four five foot long cluster of grapes and uh the children of Israel had never seen that in Egypt and that's for sure they'd never seen it on the other side of the Jordan on the other side of the Wilderness and so this was something like heaven to them I mean my uh like this you can feed a you can feed a neighborhood on grapes like that I just can't imagine a knife and a fork to eat a grape but it being so big I mean you know the grape must be extra large we weren't there we don't know we just know it was so big it took two men to carry it so there might have just been millions of little ones I don't know but it was a lot and they cut it down they bear it across and they also took pomegranates and figs in the land which were Staples and very necessary uh for the life of the children of Israel the place was called The Brook eshal because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from then and they returned from searching the land 40 days you know that's quite an Excursion that's quite an adventure 40 days of roaming the land of promise taking it all in so that you can come back and give a thorough report you know it was very very important there are 2 million plus it could been could have been anywhere by this time it could have been closer to 6 million people we don't know but millions of people are waiting for a report of what is going to be on the other side of the river so their report was of utmost importance you might call it classified information you might say that it was quite a mission and they were to bring back a report with great detail and let them know are we just going to go in and and say scram and the enem is going to run from us or we going to have to go in and take lives or we you know how are we going to are we going to have to go to real war or are they just going to lay down and and serve us and so this report was of utmost importance it took 40 days to bring back a decent report and when they got back from the land of promise the land of Canaan they went and came to Moses and to Aaron his brother and to all the congregation of the children of Israel under the Wilderness of par Pon to cadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land there must have been some oo and Oz can you imagine o you know to see grapes like that and we don't know how how Lush the pomegranates were how plentiful the figs were but we've got this we've got this image of the grapes in our mind and this was like school did did anybody have show and tail in school well we were bringing our little projects and showing them off these spies were giving quite a presentation concerning the the fruit of the land and and they go on it goes on uh uh to the next verse and they told him and said we came unto the land whether thou sest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey so there's plenty of milk and there's plenty of honey and this is the fruit of it and so they're taking it all in nevertheless the people that nevertheless is where we can get into some problem you know exaggeration is is dangerous it's dangerous to exaggerate it it it might not always be a lie but it is certainly another version of the truth a less accurate version of the truth so they said nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and more over we saw the children of anoch there these were famous children the amalekites dwell in the land of the South the Hittites and jebusites and amorites dwell in the mountains of Canaan and then the Canaanites dwell by the Sea by the coast of Jordan so now look here you've got amalekites Hittites jebusites amorites Canaanites five different tribes living in the land that God said I'm giving that land to you five enemies so to speak and so we go on and Caleb stealed the people before Moses and said let let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to do what overcome to overcome it notice we often say take it when we sing the song let us go up at once to take the country but notice Caleb didn't say we are well able to take it he said we are well able to overcome it brother brandom said in order to overcome you got to face something that you got to get over and so you can't be an overcomer if you don't face opposition you can't be an overcomer if you don't fight the faithful battle you you can't get over something that's not in your way and so there they Caleb said yeah well you see the grapes and you've heard about the the Giants but but we want you to know we can go up at one want and possess it for we we possess we carry what we need to overcome it therefore anything that's in it any enemy that lives in your promise any enemy that lives in the land of your inheritance if God said I'm giving you that land he's also going to give you the power to overcome whatever stands between you and possessing your inheritance he'll not tell you to do something and not give you the authority and power to accomplish it and so it eliminates our excuses when we like to think we're the only one facing the kind of battle that we're facing we find out there's no temptation but such as common to man that's right if you've been tempted with a situation if you've been facing a trial somebody somewhere has faced a very similar situation to the one you're going through right now and the same God who brought them through if they were depending on him is the one who will bring you through you can't expect the possess the possession or The Inheritance without a battle the prophet tells us this isn't a picnic we we're not here in the last days going to a picnic we're in a battle and we're on a ble we're not on a playground we're on a battlefield and anything worth having is worth fighting to get come on all you've got to do is just read the book of promise we are to be a people of the book and that means that what's promised to us is supposed to be what we have in front of us as our vision as our goal if God said I'm going to give you overcoming power you're going to defeat every devil in your life you're going to overcome every habit every addiction every situation if God said that it's because he knows that he's given us not he's going to give us he's given us what we need not only take it but to overcome it to get on top of it to get to the other side overcome is not just getting higher than your problem overcoming is to get clear over to the other side of your problem so that you've got the authority then to deal with the problem sometimes you speak to a mountain from this side sometime you got to get over to the other side before you can talk to it because there's a promise sometimes that goes with a territory and our territory is not on this side of Jordan our promised inheritance is on the other side that's why the word tells us that we basically I'm going to paraphrase we have to poke our heads up above what we see with our five senses and we have to take the promise instead of the condition that we see remember we're not thermometers we're thermostats amen so if you are attracting problems and situation it's probably because you're destined to overcome that kind of thing so get ready because there're seeds of Destiny this isn't you know the power of positive thinking I'm talking about I'm talking about a seed of destiny that was swn into your life before before you got here because the Bible said before we ever came he knew us did you know he knew your name before you were ever born and if he knew your name he knew who your parents were going to be he knew that one of them might be a loser both of them might be losers I told you uh last week and it's true again this week that for for I don't play games very often I you know though I just don't I don't think I'm not saying that's I'm more spiritual than somebody else but I like to find something that kind of occupies my mind so lately for about a month I've been working on my really trying to work on my family tree I've been doing it for several years but I'm really trying to do it now with a little more intention and that means going back and correcting a lot of the mistakes that I made when I was in a hurry and uh that's no fun it's fun if you're discovering new new family members but it's not fun when you've had family members married four and five times I'm not going to tell you how many in my family had so many I will tell you that it was a different generation than the one we're in now and a lot of times it was because a spouse died but there were quite a few divorces along the way and trying to figure out whose kids belong to who when you're doing family tree because sometimes in an obituary it will say uh they're survived in the name of all the children and I know know that it be rude to to break it down but I wish they would for for people who want to do their family tree it'd be so nice if they'd say you know Survive by three daughters and two stepdaughters and a and a stepson you know something like that that would help us I know it's not supposed to matter but it it kind of matters like that when you start finding out that you've got everything from from revolutionary war heroes to to horse thieves I mean literally I mean I've got articles to prove that I've got family that was arrested for stealing somebody else's horse that's terrible get your own horse you know but but anyway I'm thankful I don't have to do any of that or be any of that uh but God knew he knew he knew you he knew your strengths before you were born he knew your weaknesses before you were born and he knew whether you'd have a good family life growing up or whether you wouldn't he knew all that and he placed within you in that moment if you're his predestinated child we believe what the word said he placed within you in that moment seed of destiny that would help you to overcome when you get to each situation and trial of your life because there's one thing God's not going to let you do he's not going to let you lose in the end of this you see he tells us in his word he knew from from the beginning who would choose him and who would not choose him and so I'm glad he knew my choice he knew every good thing about my growing up he knew every negative thing about my growing up and he placed within me seeds of destiny that he can use and bring forth in the right time in the right place for the right purpose and Caleb is one of those men Joshua one of those men that God was going to use in in a in a moment of a of a of a situation that could affect the whole nation there has to be somebody who God can use to calm the people Caleb stealed the people you still with me before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it let's read on for just a moment but the men that went up with him the other spies they said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we now how do you know did you see them practicing war games did you did you visit their arsenals do you have reason to believe that they possess nuclear power why is it that you are so convinced vinced that we're not going to be able to go up against this people because they're stronger than we let's go on and they brought up not a negative report some of the other translations will say a negative report King James actually captures the expression of this better than any of the others by saying it's really an evil report now the word raah is not used in the original text there but it helps us to get an idea of what an evil report is an evil report is something that keeps us from expressing from manifesting the seed of destiny that God has placed within us it's a lie amen the truth is not going to keep you from being what God called you to be the only thing that's going to keep you from being what God called you to be is a lie so that's an evil report and there's going to be Hittites and there's going to be jebusites and there's going to be Canaanites and there's going come on that you will face in your life that will try to tell you why you can't why you can't overcome I'm going to wait on your help there will be plenty of enemies out there to tell you why you can't succeed uh and just because you flunk kindergarten and had to repeat it doesn't mean you can't have a decent job just because you were in special classes when you were growing up doesn't mean that you're going to be the a fortune five CEO 500 Fortune 500 uh you you you you can't base your present situation on your past God is the only one who can look at your past because he already knew it before you came and sort out each step that brought you to where you are you know sometime we we try to connect the dots of our life and had I not met that person I would have never known that and had I not come and had I and and look how God it's wonderful to do that if we can come out of the other side giving God praise but if we're going to come back with a negative report or an evil report when we see all that then then we just need to leave that alone they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up this sounds like Hollywood the land eats up the inhabitants thereof so it makes you wonder do we need to conquer the inhabitants or do we need to conquer the land itself because the land some somehow is eating the people I just don't believe that's what they saw I believe that's their interpretation of what they saw do you you want me to help you here just a minute they saw some Giants one family one family millions of people over there in the promised land they saw one family of Giants and from that one family of giants they decided that that that they got that fall in that fat and that ugly by eating their own people they didn't see anybody chewing on a leg this is not something they really saw this is their interpretation there are there are there there must be a reason for this genetic anomaly of these Giants it must be because they eat one another you know and so the land when they're giving this in an uh in a kind of the analogy of it they're saying the land swallows up eats up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it this is a lie this is a lie all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature you'll never convince me there weren't some shorties among them and maybe not in the family of anoch but that was only one family of giants you can't tell me that every jebusite and every perizzite and hittite and whatever were were Giant GI no one family of giants but when they're coming back you know they got so excited and they're exaggerating and the land swallows up the people and and everybody we every man in the land is a is a giant this is a terrible exaggeration it's a lie it's an evil report let's read on for just a moment it's a lot of reading I know and here there we saw the Giants the son of an anoch which come of the Giants and we were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so we were in their sight now we should turn that around and we should say we were in their sight as grasshoppers because this was an assumption it was a presumption we were in their sight as grasshoppers so we were in our sight as grasshoppers they imagined that the Giants were seeing them like grasshoppers so they began to see themselves that's what it says they began to see themselves as Grasshoppers and now not one family of giants but a whole land is full of giants you see what happens when you agree with an evil report over your life do you see what happens it changes es your perception of who you are and it changes everything you see and you start assuming what other people see in you or know about you or think about you I need some help so because we feel like they're all they're all Giants they must look at us like grasshoppers so we we we see ourselves as grasshoppers in their side and they begin to bring that back I'm so glad that among the 12 there were two that didn't see with carnal eyes that didn't believe the lies that didn't exaggerate the reality of what was there I'm glad there were two who came back with their eyes on the promise and they said if God said it that settles it I don't care if every man among the millions is a giant I refuse to see myself like a grasshopper and frankly I don't care how they see me I don't care if they see me as a grasshopper or a rhinoceros it doesn't matter because I'm going to see myself on the promise and not on the evil report isn't that right all the people we saw men of great stature uh we are in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so we were in their sight now if you look at that uh word in Hebrew evil report one of the meanings of that is again it gives us the idea of raw because the evil word has been placed there but that word is actually does not appear in the original Hebrew text that's for clarification but the the expression of this report there are several words that can be used for report in the Bible uh it can be it can also be translated a rumor same word is used in English from the Hebrew report or rumor but this particular expression uh it seems to mean in its root form to be sluggish to move slowly that's the problem that's the problem they they were drunk by their own negativity they were so negative they're captains leaders can you imagine how the rest of the tribe was if the greatest among them were sluggish and slow and lazy and who see everything from the from the uh half empty instead of the half full can can you can you imagine if you're working with people like that how easy it is to take on that kind of a spirit can you imagine if you've got leaders in the church that are like that how easy it is to take on that half empty thing you know you know we we don't never have enough we can't you know we we're Bound by this and bound by that and hindered by this and hindered by that uh I want you to know that this evil report to to move slowly to be sluggish if you look at this as First Corinthians tells us to in chapter 10 it says in the New Testament it says and all these things happen as in samples are examples to us it it's inspired the Bible tells us the whole book is inspired you can't understand the new without an understanding of the old what we see God doing and type and Shadow we see God doing an antitype and fulfillment in the New Testament and and so we've got so much to be thankful for because one thing we have had as a body of Believers is a foundation in the Old Testament yes and you need it to be able to embrace the grace and the promise of the New Testament are you still with me I'm going to try to move fast but you've got to get the foundation laid and so if there is a Old Testament ample or example there must be a new testament thought or concept or reality that we can connect the old Testament type in Sample example two did that make any sense we got to find something in the New Testament that we can directly draw connect to whatever this is supposed to be representing in the Old Testament now don't miss me the Old Testament is not a fable we are Bible Believers here and we believe if it said it happened it happened you don't really believe it flooded yes I do you don't really believe what one man got in the boat with his family and brought all yes I do I really believe that if the Bible said it I believe it you don't really believe that the Earth was recreated in just one week yes I do I believe it just like that somebody said you don't believe that the Earth that we live in now is billions of years old not as we know it now no we believe there was a pre-adamic creation and that creation was lost because of Lucifer's Ascension because of his rebellion and that Earth was plunged in a great Deluge many years before the flood the seeds of that of that land the seeds of that Civilization or that uh creation whatever it was lay beneath the waters in Genesis 1 and the spirit of God moved brooded upon the face of the deep the seed of AE brother random tells us the seed of a previous civilization lay beneath that water and in God's time he took the Earth off of the back burner so to speak and he said I'm going to recreate and in six days he recreated is't that amazing in the beginning he created something from nothing in the recreation he took the seed of what he had already created and remember every seed must bring forth after its own kind that's what the word tells us and we can run that from Genesis all the way to Revelation can't we and so God began to speak to this what was left and what the water had flooded and if you watch the language it didn't want to take time to do this this morning but if you watch the language of Genesis the Earth began to rise up out of the water the seed of everything that God had created in the original creation whatever it looked like it's now coming up out of the water and taking form to recreate the Earth so if they find a fossil or a dinosaur or a bone we're not like some fundamental Christians who deny their existence we just understand that they existed in a pre-adamic existence a pre-adamic earth and so sure they existed to tell your children they never existed would be a foolish lie what are these Bon well Satan made though no no come on folks he didn't make those bones they're remnants of something that was we don't focus on that we're in a recreated Earth if the Bible said it I believe it that settles it so if there is an Old Testament uh you know example type there must be some new testament reality so I found what I believe is part of this reality in Ephesians 4 and if you want to understand it uh a lot you can go and read the entire book of Hebrews because Hebrews is a parallel to to Joshua to Exodus to to many of the things that God was doing in the Old Testament type he fulfilled in the New Testament reality of Jesus Christ and we read about that in the book of Hebrews but here's a reality from Ephesians 4: 13 in the Amplified thank you for staying with me it says that it might develop until we all attain oness in the faith and in the comprehension I want you to to to notice now that we are about to read of a great stature something very tall something not of ordinary height but something of great stature and great height he said uh attain Oneness in the faith and in the comprehension of the full and accurate knowledge of the Son of God that we might arrive that we might arrive at really mature manhood this is spiritually so this is to Sisters too this is not this is not you you know uh working on the car or or or starting a fire without a match and you've really you know got the manhood thing down pat this is a spiritual manhood it's a high one we're actually talking about the stature of Christ see the enemy wants to cause you to be afraid of something that seems taller than you are I wish you'd hear me no wonder they come out saying everybody's a giant when reality there was just a handful of giants because this is an Old Testament type of a new testament reality there's going to be a people who refuse to fear the fullness of the stature that lays before them there's a tall guy let me say it this way there's a tall guy in your future and it's you it's you it's Christ first and then it's you so the enemy wants to make a an a fearful thing out of something taller than you are well you're not called to live a life of dissension you're you're called to live a life of Ascension and you're not climbing the corporate ladder you're climbing the spiritual ladder which is the attributes of Jesus Christ let's read it he said into the full and accurate knowledge of the Son of God that we might arrive at really mature manhood the completeness of Personality which is nothing less than the standard height of Christ's yes when when brother brandom is preaching the message the stature of a perfect man I always retitle that when I use the phrase the stature of the perfect man because we have an ample Christ is the first man to come to the full maturity of of of true sunship you heard what Hawke was saying here are you with me I know this is a lot for for a short amount of time but Hawke was praying and he said what a perfect Papa we have and then he said something we don't often talk about we we talk about how he is a perfect father but we don't often talk about how he was also an example of what it means to be a perfect son because he lived in perfect union he said I am my father father are one so perfect sunship looks like Oneness with the father this is the sunship promised to the overcoming believer that's the that's the sunship that's yours that's the sunship that's mine that we might also attain unto the stature of his maturity his completion his Perfection and it's not something we win for ourselves it's something that we receive as we overcome you see when he's preaching that stature of a perfect man he draws it in a pyramid from Peter and he places those virtues like one on top of another and you're climbing the pyramid to the top and and you you move from one virtue to the next are you still here and the Holy Spirit told us some years ago that it's not just you know passing through one virtue to the next it's really a birthing something's got to be birthed in you before you can climb higher what did the Holy Spirit say about this year this is a year for mountain climbing I he wasn't talking about Everest he wasn't talking about rir he was talking about Zion this is a year to climb higher on Mount Zion and what is Mount Zion spiritually it is is the it is the it is the measure of the stature of the fullness of the Christ the anointed one it's Jesus before us as an example in Jesus was the perfect father in Jesus was the perfect son in order for you and I to step into the completion and Perfection of a perfect son we've got to understand first our Oneness with the father Jesus said I don't do anything this is what he said I don't do anything unless I see or hear it of my father when the bride comes to that place that she realizes that the enemy has been trying to make us fearful of things that are taller than us and we begin to realize that's our destiny we're shorties now I feel like brother sadu you know he the word shorty a lot we're shorties now but we've got something to to climb toward we have a goal hear the Holy Ghost we have a goal before us it is the it is the measure of the Lord's Perfection and completion and it looks unattainable to us so when we look at our present situation all we see is Giants a whole land full of them reality there's only a few out to get you but you have now made them everybody everybody's a giant everybody's an enemy everybody's out to destroy me let me tell you somebody's in a prayer closet somewhere praying for you whether you know it or not everybody's not out to destroy you everybody doesn't want to see you fail somebody somewhere loves you and is calling your name before the Lord so that your vision can change and you will refuse to fear everything that's higher than what you're living right now now you're hearing Revelation I hope you can grab a hold of it because here is an Old Testament example of exaggeration based on the testimony uh uh evil report of 10 you can't always listen to the majority sometime you've got to listen to the minority so I want you to know that the enemy gives we have this example in the Old Testament of how the enemy the fear of the enemy the fear of the Giants that walked in the land produced a report given to a whole generation a whole a a whole nation not generation multiple generations of an entire nation could have crippled them it could have kept them all out of the promise if they would have listened to others around us if you would have listened to those who have spoken against you and against this church and against our destiny and against our future you would have given up a long time ago but many of you refused when there were even evil reports Among Us who said you never even fill up the church you've gotten now and we know what God can do he showed us two years ago that in one year that's he can send a wave all we need is a few more waves we're not looking for more people it's not that we feel like we've got to have more people or a bigger number but we're looking for people who are likeminded who refuse to fear the stature of the enemy because they've got their eyes on the stature of the fullness of Christ and we realize that a bride is being prepared in the last days to have Oneness with the Father the prophet said she will have thus saith the Lord or she will keep still right you see we're talking talking about a people emerging who will know the mind of God somebody said how could I ever know the mind of God really all you have to do is read the book this Bible reveals the mind of God hear a tape hear a sermon this these sermons reveal to us when we place them in the word that they've got to go back to the absolute brother brandom had an absolute you better have an absolute and for those who call the spoken word book uh they're they're absolute it's a very dangerous thing because man has worked on that editors have helped us with that you see there were there were certain things brother Ram said take that out but after brother bandham died they decided we'll put that back in if he wanted that out he knew there was a reason he had a reason he knew there was some confusion that could come out of that some misunderstanding out of that for instance the seven seal in the Rapture message in Yuma he knew there were some things there that could easily be misunderstood misunderstood by Immature people he said take it out but editors decided well he's gone now doesn't really matter we want the bride to have it all we'll put it all back in not realizing that if a if a if a prophet has the mind of God he had the mind of God when he said hello so there's a lot of confusion that we wouldn't deal with today if we didn't have editors but of course you have to have those who handle these things and print these things and record these things so forth and Etc prayer lines taken off I want you to know God has ministered to my heart so many times in the prayer lines that we have left many of them taken off years ago never even got to the filtering stage because they had already been removed so when we filter the tape instead of putting it back on it was just left off I'm saying that sometime you're you're coming to the end and he's ministering I think I read one to you recently maybe Tuesday night and and he's ministering to an individual he's talking to this woman he said that Devil's trying to tell you you're dying you're going to have a heart attack was that what it was and die but that's not it it's your nerves it's your hormones it's menopause somebody said wouldn't that be embarrassing I tell you it'd be a whole lot better than sitting there thinking you're dying of a heart attack or a stroke he said no sister your problem is in there and we're going to believe God to heal you to deliver you to fix you so there's a lot of things that are in there so everything everything that we have today in its written or recorded form we must take it back because that's what he said he actually said don't take my word for it he said check the absolute so once we read the word and hear the word and we hear the message of the hour we receive from what we hear placing the message on the word then it becomes the same when it fits the word when you find its doveet tail then you can take all of it and fight the devil but the Bible is our absolute if for no other reason because he said so if you're a purist because he said so what about the mistake he said so well what about all the mistranslations or names dropped or stories he said so he said this Bible we have is an absolute reality we can stand on that so we take what we hear we place it there and we begin to see a fuller picture we see the right interpretation of the word because of the message that God has sent us we should be very grateful for it but we shouldn't deoti men we shouldn't worship men no we should put our faith our trust beyond our pastor Beyond a prophet Beyond come on beyond our church members it's Christ who perfects us it's his Perfection we're working toward Satan wants you to be afraid of anything higher than you and Christ wants you to be willing to take a hold of anything that's higher than you because he knows it's him so he's saying come up and isn't that what he said in Revelation 4 there's a door opening up John don't you want to come up here and see don't you want to come up in here there's a bride that will not be satisfied uh staying on the other side of the Jordan fearing things that are higher than they are they're going to climb they're going to go through the open door they're going to go through the open Heaven they're going to take a hold of the measure the stature the measure the fullness of Christ and they're going to manifest the only seed that's worth manifesting his seed anybody with me it's not your natural seed that's not worth manifesting but his spiritual seed in you is aren't you glad you carry it oh my I'm tired it's just 12:41 let me take just a few more moments now go to numbers four you've seen at least a glimpse I'll take some time in the future to to ground that old testament old testament example connecting it to a new testament reality I'll do that another time but I want to read this first this is numbers 14 next chapter over you still with me praise God and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night why because this evil report had been given we're going to die we're all going to die the Giants are going to eat us if the Giants don't get us the land is going to get us cuz the land eats up its own inhabitants hello can you imagine sitting around oh children we we we must try not to be afraid the land that God has promised us opens its mouth and swallows People Like Us children we must not be afraid everybody all 10 million 100 million we don't know how all 100 million of them are giants and if they step on us they crush us like grasshoppers real encouraging message isn't it it sounds like some of us when we when we've been listening to Too Much media social media and everything is rotten everything's a conspiracy I believe there are conspiracy theories no doubt about it you get don't get under that Spirit don't get under that Eric Norman I hung up on him one time my dear friend who's with the Lord I hung up on him one time because he was getting so carried away you see I wouldn't be surprised I don't know why I've asked the Lord why I wouldn't be surprised if that's not one of the reasons the Lord just called him home because you can get so caught up on everything being a conspiracy that you don't know what to believe and you start even losing sight of what is absolute everybody's got to have an anchor everybody's got to have an absolute everybody's got to have something to measure everything else by and so you've got to be a little bit careful there so the people wept that night and all all the children of Israel and here's what happens when people get their their dreams dashed you know oh we're going to take the land we're going to take the land we're going to take the land then they find out there's obstacles then they find out they're Giants then they find out that the giant grapes are not the only thing giant they're people there their whole family of in fact everybody's a giant if you listen to the 10 who gave the evil report so what do people do they begin to murmur against the leadership they murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would God that we had died come on would God that we had died in the land of Egypt or would God we had died in the wilderness yes you know I can see this we don't want Giants to eat us so we we wish we to starve to death in the wilderness so the vultures could have eaten our bones and we wouldn't have known anything about it it makes no sense this place that the children of Israel got in we wished we would have just died over there in Egypt forgetting the promise and look you selfish somebody if you don't want the promise maybe your son does maybe your daughter does maybe your granddaughter does maybe your grandson wants to inherit the promise so maybe maybe you should have died over there in Egypt or in the wilderness but thank God you didn't because now you're bringing forth another generation who may find the faith to conquer the giant who may get their eyes hear me they may get their eyes so fixed on the on the fullness in the stature of Christ that they that they're not looking looking at the height of their enemy and listening to the fear that the enemy spews they're looking at the at the man in the mirror who is no longer you but it's now Christ you look at Christ long enough you'll be like him that's what the word said you look at your enemy long enough you'll be like him that's right you like to write those little sayings down write that one down that was good you you spend your time looking at Jesus the Bible tells us more like him you look more like him you'll become but if you focus on your enemy you're only going to behave and mimic his behavior so maybe you're going to wish that you would have died a generation ago or died in the wilderness on the way over but think about your children and your grandchildren they may be the ones who don't let the height of the enemy keep them from the height of their Destiny and the height of their Destiny is the fullness of the stature of Jesus Christ I wish you were with me some of you are I appreciate it very much this sad bunch of people oh wish we W and there and wherefore hath the Lord brought us into this land to Fall by The Sword and our W I don't think you need the sword the land eats the people remember that our wives and our children should be a prey were it not better for us to return turn to Egypt that's real good so there's a little problem around the message something didn't turn out just like somebody thought it was somebody's interpretation of a sign wasn't exactly what the sign was and maybe there was a you know few less died when when they thought so why don't we just all throw it all away and return to Egypt where they worship frogs you know I'd rather take my chances with a prophet who had an imperfect recall that's because the message itself is what sits on the on the word that's right that's why we're following this truth not because of a cloud not because of a a pillar of fire in a photograph if that's what Vindicated the truth for you you were looking for something like that there were people who were looking looking for something that would unlock the word this message for me unlocked the word so all the other testimonies are are are just icing on the cake and a cherry on top I don't follow for that I follow because the word has been unlocked I no longer see Jesus between the lattice he's now in full view we know who he is we know he's not the second person of a trinity we know who he is he's who John said he was but we couldn't believe John because the church had told us something else John told us he was the word made flesh but the denominational system had told us that he was the second person of a trinity but you can't be the second person of a trinity and the word made flesh at the same time because the word made flesh is the word of God in in its entirety and morality now in a human body and that's why the fullness the scripture said the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in Christ so when Christ came there was no more no more God over there and God over there and God somewhere else there's a first person somewhere and a third person and a 10th person somewhere no no no no no When Jesus showed up the the entirety of the godhead had found a body and by the way the whole family of Heaven is named after him so do you know what your name is m Jesus Christ the New Testament said we bear the name of the family wo we carry the family name and it's not Shelly the family name is Ms Jesus Christ that's what I got to keep my eyes on not that not that giant let's go on my we got to hurry and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return un Egypt that's always the answer like like like our nation let's just get us a new president as tempting as that as that sounds and we definitely have got to have a president because we don't have one now there's no doubt about it that we've got to get one please understand that not one man is going to be able to fix what's wrong because Washington is full of crooks on both sides of the aisle and the only way we could have real hope is to get rid of all of them and start over our Constitution doesn't allow that so we're going to have to put up with a lot of stuff until Rapture time now a good strong leader could make a a good difference there's no doubt about it but there's always going to be liberals my family said that she didn't mean it that way but I'm trying to keep up with the way things are going now and and the the strange looking little waitress that that we had yesterday little odd way about her just very very strange way I go up to pay the bill and she asked me she asked me what their name is I had Eliana Jane what their name is my family said well that wouldn't have been appropriate to say it well in my generation you wouldn't have been offended if someone said oh what's his name that wouldn't have been offensive because you you would have said it in your tone you wouldn't have said what's his name or what it what what is it what what's its name she said to me what's their name I considered that she was nervous she'd been rude the whole day I wasn't expecting her to be nice all of a sudden but I said oh she's one her name is Elana Jane I realized she didn't want to offend me cuz you know you can just imagine I looked like somebody who used various pronouns she didn't know which pronoun to use for the baby so she used a plural one instead of a singular one this world is in trouble if you keep your eyes on this you'll never see him you're going to have to take your eyes off of what's around you your enemies too and get your eyes on him the word he's the only thing that's going to remain Rock Steady in an election I'm depending on him to help me get through what this Earth is is about we we know that Earth birth pains are coming worse than what we have known the Bible tells us so come on then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the Assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel stay with me just another few moments and uh Joshua the son of noon and Caleb the son uh of yeona which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes and they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel saying the land which we pass through to search it is an exceeding good land hello if the Lord Delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it us a land which floweth with milk and honey do you understand that somebody saw the vision that it's not up to us to take the land it's up to him to help us get what he promised we don't overcome in our own power we get over in his power somebody spoke some reality here it is indeed a land flowing with milk and honey let's go on only Rebel not ye against the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land hello I hope you're hearing this you hearing this Luke jurnigan want to make sure everybody is hearing this because this is of utmost importance only Rebel not against the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bread bread it it's gone to from them eating us to us eating them now please understand this was not a a there there is a Prohibition in the in the Covenant that you can't eat flesh and drink blood that's right it's only spiritually that we that we eat the Flesh of Jesus Christ it's spiritually symbolically that we drink his blood otherwise we're vampires the Bible said the life is in the blood to consume the blood is to take something's life to try to consume its life and and that's why that's why Kosher meat is is butchered in a certain way because they're they're trying to understand what this scripture was saying so it's hung and cut in a certain way so that the uh uh the the the maximum amount of blood flows out of it so that you don't eat anything in its own blood this is really a spiritual concept that man once again is made a very natural way of trying to explain it I'll just stick with the spirit if you don't mind but anyway moving right along he's not saying Caleb or Joshua's talking now it just says they we don't know exactly which one brother brandom calls it in one place Joshua I read where many other people call it Caleb but one of the two somebody one of them is talking back here and uh they're saying that we're not going to rebel against God we're not going to fear the people of the land for they are just bread for us he's not meaning that we will physically eat them he's meaning that the more we conquer the more we Face our fears yeah it's an analogy the stronger we get and we just live from one Victory to a next from one glory to a next from One Faith and strength to the next faith and strength just like the Bible said you know like David you kill a lion and a bear then a Goliath don't look like so much of an enemy you're you know what are you you uncircumcised philistine uh God's already given me the lion God's already given me the bear he'll give me your head too so from one Victory you move on so you you knock one giant down you can go after the next one that's what that's the the analogy that's being spoken here but I like the way it reads they're just breed for us they're not really in our way they're really just little battles that we have to win to get to to the bigger Victory I wish you were listening to the bigger Victory that's on the other side we're not going to fear them is that right and look what the next verse said there's two more verses but all the congregate did that not sound like an amazing sermon to you fear the lord don't rebel against him we're going to eat them all wouldn't that encourage you well it didn't encourage the church isn't it amazing that a preacher can hear from God dig and and bring something from the word to feed the people to strengthen the people to bless the people to help guide and direct and correct shape and mold the people and when he delivers it I I if he's been with God it sounds like God to him him isn't it amazing when something inspired he thinks at least is inspired can go over in the house like a lead balloon or a rat sandwich or who's he preaching to or this is the wrong church or why is he picking on me but here's what happens when the people are not in tune thank God you are but when the people are not in tune with their leader they can't really hear the full effectiveness of what he says and so he's giving this amazing advice we're going to eat him we got to deal with them one way or the other we're going to mow them down come on team you think of your little sport analogy you know come on team like the like the little movie The Kendrick brothers made Facing the Giants and they brought it down to a football we can do this you know one time I showed the clip of the quarterback with the coach on his back or another dude on his back and he's and he's pulling him pulling him or whatever he was position he played he's got him on his back and he's plowing the field and pushing the obstacles and what have you out of his way because that's a pretty good analogy when he gets through with the sermon when you get through here's the here's the reaction of the people reminds me of so many people around this message but all the congregation B Stone them with stones nobody we don't have reason to believe that anybody believed the sermon we can make bread out of them hear me we can make bread out of them and the glory of the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel because sometimes when the people can't say Amen God will come on and the Lord said unto Moses how long will this people provoke me and how long will it be a they believe me for all the signs which I have showed among them I will Smite them one more verse with the pestilence I will disinherit them and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they that's a pretty serious word isn't it now how many of you know In fairness Moses goes before God on behalf of the people and says please don't do that and so God settled with Moses and he said how about I'll just wipe out this generation the generation of the evil report hello and I'll raise up their sons all their fathers could see was the reasons why not how about I fall on a generation that all they can see is yes you can yes you can sir this sermon is already titled online yes you can turn to somebody and say yes you can and the reality is if you don't if you're called to it and you don't God will bypass you he won't let you stop the flow that's right he'll go down to your children and your grandchildren he'll find a younger people who won't keep their eyes on the Giants they keep their eyes on the fullness of the stature of Christ are you with me we got to close I just I'm really just getting started so this will be more than one part we're on page three now Mariah you put 12 pages in so you did amazing thank you let me read this to you and a few more and we'll close maybe you all right good good maybe you do need a bathroom break it's certainly all right with me come back when you're done but what is it it's a promise I'm reading now sweetheart from presuming but what is it you got some highlighting in too it's a promise God made the promise now here's what he said you tell me ellias read it let's let's stay with it God made the promise I can't help what the evil report was I can't help what the majority said hello God made the promise Moses didn't make the promise brother brandom didn't make the promise God made the promise of what the bride will be in the last day God made the promise hello so we're keeping our eyes on the promise and the God who made the promise and let's stay with it he said God promised it no matter you've got to have a battle if everything comes lazy what are you overcoming they overcome by the word of God and their testimony the what the blood of Christ give me just a moment thank you so much let's go on you've got to overcome you you didn't want to highlight the why sweetheart I'm playing I'm playing you've got to overcome something and you've got to have some obstacles nobody wants to amen that you got to have some more problems amen you got to have some more obstacle amen and people that different and fuss with you you got to have people to fuss with you if you ain't got nobody to fuss with you you don't have anybody to overcome right that's right thank you for being my somebody you you ought to thank somebody just thank you thank your crazy uncle next Thanksgiving thank you for being the person that I can fuss with so that I can overcome and people that diver and fuss with you and tell you're Holy Rollers you you got to have a little opposition he said that's put before you it's a trail just a trail if you haven't got that uhoh hello it's quiet if you haven't got that you're not even in the battle if everybody in your life agrees with you over everything you're not even in the battle here you think you're fighting so hard and you're not even fighting you're not even in the battle God's got to place people in your life it don't make them right that you may not be right they may not be right but just because they're fussing with you don't mean they're right but God lets them be there at time they're certainly certainly not right to make fun of your faith your religion what you believe call you a holy world that's certainly not right come on I'm not making fun of I'm not making fun of them if I can possibly help it sometimes I I do but not often not real often they've got to be there there there's got to be somebody to think you're a Holy Roller there's got to be somebody to look at your wife and daughters when you walk into a room somebody's got to go how abnormal that is to be modest how weird how strange how crazy how Gaz it is is to cover your body hello oh my goodness people you know it's lingerie what people wear in public is lingerie are you really going to talk about that yeah I think I will for just a minute on yeah lingerie they they don't even you know and put a little shirt over it oh my hanging out everywhere every it way hanging everywhere you can't tell whether they're fighting to get in it or fighting to get out of it it's like the Oldtimer said I've seen more cotton in an aspirin bottle and then they call you a Holy Roller some goody goody CU you don't do just like they do oh they got you got to have it it's a trial if you haven't got that you're not even the battle what did you join the church he said what you know what what what's the use let's go on what did you join the Army and get training for to lay around strut up and down the street and show off that's the way some Christians act that we want to be looked up to you need not expect the world to look up to you anymore that was a generation ago where someone really respected a woman who looked like a woman that's not this generation they resent it it's judgmental to them of course you're going to run into people who remember the good old days but this generation you know you're a you're a a prude you're you're judging me I didn't even talk to you I didn't even look at you you you know I want to say sometime when you're confronted like that you you know you've got so many holes in your body I think your brain slipped through one of them but I'm not judging you do like you want to but move and give me the freedom to move like I want to move he said don't wait don't wait they're not going to look up to you some you ain't going to be looked up to let's go on you're going to be looked down on for all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall what suffer persecutions pick up the sword pick up the sword don't cry and belly a and say I'm I'm persecuted on my job my family persecutes me everybody hates me nobody loves me I think I'll eat worms no the prophet said pick up the sword cut everything free from you don't let their words slow you down don't let them be lies of giants in your ears don't let your enemies Tower over you you climb higher than they are every and keep going on is that what he said Joshua Caleb stealed the people few more minutes they said we can't take it we just can't do it that's all see they were looking at the amalekites Joshua and Caleb thank you sister Kathy was looking at the promise he said that's the difference I want you to tell somebody that's the difference they were looking at the promise I want you to tell somebody else yes you can oh yes you can they were looking at the promise that's the difference depends on what you're looking at if you look at your problems they grow you're your normal enemy six foot you know but you keep staring at your enemy brother Ram talks to us about you know brother Papa wz his dream of the of the shoe devil thing here's this big enemy towering over him and and he just starts using the Bible boo devil and the next thing you know what happens to his giant he begins to eat him because he starts getting little little little until he's no more than a frog leg on a plate don't eat frog legs but anyway Move Along depends on what you're looking at Joshua said we're more we're more we're more evil report we can't we can't I never will I don't have what it takes positive report oh yes you can oh yes you can I can't weather this storm oh yes you can I can't conquer my Temptation oh oh yes you can I can't get victory over my addiction oh yes you can what are you looking at if you're looking at the giant everybody looks giant if you're looking at your promise watch Giants begin to shrink watch enemies Begin to Fall watch them go from looking like your conqueror to your sandwich this is the concept you see the scripture reveals two ways I'm I'm going don't leave it up just leave it right up the scripture reveals two ways to deal with a giant in in 1st Samuel 17 we won't read it but in 1st Samuel 17 we can do like David did we can cut the giant down we can knock him down and cut his head off that's what David did but Goliath knocked him down the word got to him before the stone ever did it's the word of the Lord how dare you defy the armies of the most high God the reality the Revelation that there was one God mightier than the all the gods that people had made up in their mind that word hit the giant before the stone did the stone knocked him right over and David ran over and took the sword and cut his head off with the sword so you've got a choice what you want to do with your enemy you can hit him with a word you can cut his head off or the other way the Bible other way the scripture talks about dealing with giant you can eat them you can eat them it's a metaphor they're bread for us and if you would have seen the expression it's actually is actually something that's used in Hebrew more than once and it's a metaphor of bending over and harvesting something with your hand and drawing it to your mouth so Joshua or Caleb whoever was doing the talking here that's really what he said when he when when we read this in the scripture that's really what he did there's a metaphor attached to the phrase and he said you know these Giants they're just bread for us and he probably symbolized it with the hebraism he plucked it and Drew it up to his mouth or they can be breed for us now I want you to know if you'd have had an ear to hear that day if you'd have been spiritual your nine foot giant would have been reduced to your paper plate that you eat your baloney sandwich on that's all he was trying to do is to show them what looks like it's big enough to crush you with his toe is no more than a loaf of bread on your plate when you've got your eye on the promise instead of the size of your enemy I'm preaching to you today I got to go but I'm preaching to you today so you've got to look you got to look at your situation and see if it's really really that Gargantua so huge or will you turn and look at your promise and will it happen for you like it happened to Joshua and Caleb the enemy just starts getting little little I can get over this he said we're more than able they're only bread for us us come on brother brandham said why they look great listen they look great he's bragging on the they look great they're great they are great sir you hear what he's saying little humor here they are great they'll make great bread brother Bam's carrying the analogy the little joke a little further yeah they're great they're great J great men men of great stature well they'll just make great bread they'll just make a great snack I thought this was so amazing because my son showed me a video this week of a very popular worship group on uh on uh social media I don't know where all they are Tik Tok Instagram all the all the various places not to be they're there and they have apologized for one of their favorite songs and and you know what I'm done I'm done I'm done I when when the woke mentality reaches worship I'm through with that I don't ever have to hear another i' never heard him before anyway so they're not they're not going to miss my my dollar but you know they apologize he said this morning he just he just getting ready to run over that song again his favorite worship song and he said we we just you know we just realized that it that it sounds so violent e eat we eat Giants for our bread or or or our enemy becomes bread it just sounds so Old Testament did did am I saying it right Benjamin oh oh yeah yeah excuse me it wasn't the bread it was the water praise is the is the water our enemies drowned in it's the same kind of concept I don't know why they didn't say this probably don't sing this one it's too violent you know the song that we sing about Giants now they now we can't do the little phrase Praises of what our enemies drowning because enemies drowning it sounds too Old Testament it sounds too violent that that represents the Old Testament you don't read anything about like that going on in the New Testament you know I got a serious problem with that there was a lot going on in the Old Testament there was a lot going on in the New Testament too slightly different Covenant slightly different Grace but if you just go one generation past the New Testament you'll find out that the church has always been they were being persecuted then but one generation pass they were being persecuted like never before come on and murdered for their faith so there comes a time that your faith has to get you know your strength has to get a little violent we're not literally going to start eating one another or drowning one another in waters of Praise it's symbolic and it means we're not going to let the enemy defeat us we're going to praise Anyway come on and our praise will be like the Red Sea that Pharaoh's Army drowned in and when they looked over and saw Pharaoh's Army drowning in the Red Sea the enemy defeated what did Miriam do she picked up a tambourine and danced before the Lord The Horse and Rider thrown into the sea people are getting too strange too violent what battle are you are you you know what you're you're you're on a picnic then we're not on a picnic we're on a battlefield we got enemies we're not talking about people maybe you misunderstand we're not talk about people we're not facing physical Giants we're facing those giants in the spirit and they're only giant because we concentrate on them we focus on them and they grow you get the point the Bible teaches us to fear them not now let's go on we're more than able yeah yeah they different with us they're scared of us sure sure the fear of the Lord's upon every one of them here's a different report instead of us fearing them the fear of the Lord is falling on every one of them they're scared to death of us that's the kind of sermon you want to hear let's go take it get God give it to us so it's ours oh yes you can Samuel Duke oh yes you can you can no matter what your enemy says you can it's a promise you didn't come this far in truth to check out now to be your enemy snack now you've come this far to make your enemy a snack hello let's go on and take it where where's the next oh if I could get that Pentecostal group together he's talking about his own generation that uncircumcised Philistine standing out there and they say we have to have this we have to have that he saw the Pentecostal Church churches reaching out for entertainment and for all kinds of fellowships and organizations because they wanted to attract and draw the people in he said we have to have all this all that nonsense he said we'll have to kind of go in the world Council of churches to have fellowship with them that's nonsense he said our fellowship is from God not with a council of men and man-made Dogma we are the people of God who expect Fellowship God that's where our rights is with God how can we fellow fellowship with God lest we Fellowship in his word because the word is God and the word made flesh when it becomes was that a misspeak oh no he said if you abide in me my word in you then ask what you will there you are see but the word got to abide in here if it don't the shower Falls and why it can't produce because you don't believe it no matter how much you profess to believe it you've got to believe it all right so Israel God Called Moses out and said I'm going to destroy the whole nation just step aside Moses interceded throwed himself in the Bree what caused him to do that it was Christ in Moses it was the nature of God in Moses you see God would have killed the whole world one time for sin but Christ throwed himself in the breach for the whole human race hello Moses thr himself in the bridge for Israel and he said you made a promise God you made a promise aren't you glad that Moses knew his God aren't you glad Moses knew how to deal with his God aren't you glad Moses wasn't afraid to talk to his God I'm glad he wasn't afraid that God was going to make him a a piece of dust he said now I'm just here to remind you God here you said they're all going to go down you said you made us a promise that you would take them that's right I hope you're hearing this to the land yes he said that's right what did Moses do to God when looked like God was going to do something contrary I don't believe he did it with a hearty spirit I believe he did it with great faith and reverence he just said here it is God read it for yourself your word said you were going to take these people you promised that you were going to take these people the promis now if you want to kill them all knowing what you promised he throw the word in his way amen amen oh I love that now I feel like shouting just talking about it put the word in the way God won't walk over his own word lay the word out there you can't come any closer you rotten dirty devil you can't get over the word and God's not going to step over his word as though he would disregard it or ignore it said you promised to do it you said you'd take them to a good land that was flowing with milk and honey I've told them what you said and here we are we're on your hands God said I'll take that stubborn bunch and let them R in the wilderness and he did but I'll take them children of theirs that they said they wouldn't go anywhere they'd perish in the wilderness and I will take them over that's right no matter what kind of pressure gets put on us by other churches and other groups and other folks and families and other believing churches and so forth Etc we must never get caught up in the arguments of a generation that have rotted in the wilderness anyway speaking symbolic we've got to we've got to focus on a generation that said this has nothing to do your age this is not your age so don't think it is if you're thinking age you've missed this if you think when we're saying young we mean young age-wise we don't we mean a generation that thinks differently than those who said we can't we're looking for somebody that says we can we don't care if they're 87 or eight it doesn't matter to us their age we're looking for somebody that says if God said we can we can if God said that we can defeat our enemies we'll just make them a snack hello he said I'll take them over that's right musicians are coming wo let me do one more quotation from what shall we do with this Jesus called Christ Mo all that work you did and I didn't get but to two thank you sweetie like the spies on the road to the promised land they was in an exodus coming out of Egypt come out by a promised word of God how did they get out by a promised word of God how did you get out of your Egypt of sin by a promised word of God how did you get out of your church prison your denominational prison your law by a promised word of God hello God made his word known by a prophet Moses sent him down there he was identified that he was God to bring him out under the conditions that he promised to the what by whose authority by the authority of in Hebrew it could read just the same I will be that I will be commentators look at that and they say that God is basically saying I can be anything I need to be all I need to know is what you need me to be and I am do you know what you need God to be hello hello do you know what you need God to be do you know what you need him to be in your life he said I am I need somebody to help me out of this financial ruin God said I am I need somebody to help me get a better job God said I am I need some Deliverance in my life God said I am a deliverer I need some help in my body I am a Healer let me tell you something I've been watching my own body obey my confession these last few weeks just speaking the word of God someone said other someone else said to me I'm just confessing this over my body over my life and I'm watching God make differences he will do it he said I am I will be what I will be I will be what you need I need direction I need some decision making ability God said I amall I need some help in my relationship God said I [Music] am I need some communication changes between my my wife and I or my husband and I God said it'll never be any different oh yes you can yes can let me go on when they come to the Borderland Baria the great mistake they made when they got to the land and looked over into the promised land they said we can't take it and you know what happened it cost them another lap or two around the mountain that's judgment the prophet said judgment strikes at Kadesh Baria that's where the rubber meets the road that's where you come down to a place where you've got to believe God or believe the report of your giant your enemy and if you don't believe God In This Moment you can just rest assure you're going around the mountain again yes and it's going to cost you something it'll cost you something the great mistake they made when they got to the land looked over in the promised land they said we can't take it what was the other 10 they looked at the circumstances The Prestige they would lose we're grasshoppers to the side of them but Joshua and Caleb what did they do Church they checked up they went back to the word back to the word and the Lord said I'll give you this land it's a good land flowing with milk and honey they didn't count what it look like amen what this was and what this evidence was God said I give it to you go get it and they were the only ones that went in a whole generation of people had to die on this side of the Wilderness so that a new generation of people could be let in and the and the scripture tells us in in uh Deuteronomy and I'll read it to you the next time we're together maybe or at least next Sunday he said only Caleb because he had another spirit he was part of the same generation but he had another Spirit something was a hold of him that said yes I can yes I can he said that's right oh let us check the promises of God for today that's right remember we're in another Exodus a time in Exodus this time not into a Promised Land of the Earth but into a promised land of glory where there's no return no more glory to God we're going to be there will you you do it I don't mean no harm but I feel sorry for my brothers and

the right Spirit oh yes you can I just can't respond well to correction oh yes you can I I don't like nobody telling me what to do I want to tell you something folks you're you're in for a miserable lonely isolated life because whoever you are whatever you're doing in life there's going to be somebody that has a little authority over you somewhere even if you're the top of the ladder you're the top of the food chain in a big Corporation other corporations other other top businesses will influence your decisions you're watching to see what others are doing somebody's always is going to have a little place over you you've got to learn oh yes I can I can submit to the holy spirit of God I can I can oh yes you can Jesus Christ said whatsoever things you desire When you pray let me have you to stand with me would you stretch those legs and and and and and uh get to where your hind portions are not numb from sitting so long oh yes you can yes Jesus Christ said whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive it you shall have it I believe it he said don't you don't you does somebody believe it the word said it I have to believe it now the enemy the whole thing this whole race this whole journey is to try to keep you afraid of something higher than you and there's only one thing that's higher than you that's God the word in its completeness and fullness so everything else has to magnify be magnified in your eyes that's the way the enemy works on the emotions you keep looking at the mole hill just a little dirt you know down here like this you keep looking at the mole hill and guess what like granny used to say you've made a mountain out of a mole hill that's what happen when you look at it when you focus on it when you place your attention on it it just gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger so all the nose get bigger and the yeses gets quieter and smaller until you oh yes yes you can I I I can't stop talking about other people and being negative about everything oh yes you can I can't take my rightful turn I demand my rights I demand my seat I've seen some of you precious people even lately asking somebody to move over out of your seat I just can't give up oh yes you can right you can stretch yourself my kids were with Brother G and visited another church on Wednesday night they were there early and the person whose seat they got wasn't there early and and and thank the Lord she didn't March in with her hands on her hips and say get out of my seat she just tried to slip in quietly and get her things out of the way and they offered to get up no no no no no that's how we ought to be thank God I love it when I don't like it when people come in late but I love it when somebody does come in late and they have to look for a place to sit it or come in early and they have to look for a place to see it because somebody oh yes you can your prestige I is is little little in God's favor here we're we're we're not we don't have any claims

this song is he's put the emphasis back where it has to be it needs to be the the title was oh yes you can and I think I showed you why you can because God made the promise but remember that the focus is on him it's not my ability my strength my smarts my good looks for sure that's going to get me through it's because of what he is and what he has done that we're able so it's always him it's always him it's always him but but he knows he knows what he can do you've got to keep that in your mind and you've got to understand that we are more than conquerors through Christ Jesus and you may have to tell yourself sometime oh yes I can because he did oh yes I can because he said right we could wipe some negativity out of our vocabul ulary focusing on him couldn't we let's sing it one more time this time with an emphasis in knowing he's the mighty conqueror he's the one that makes it a a possibility it makes it a a a more than a possibility makes it reality because he's done the work we can we can enter in to that work and we share the victory I'm so thankful that the victory is ours because the victory is his and he's sharing it with us let's sing that chorus a time or two through he is

hold of the victory on our behalf so your Victory is our Victory your Resurrection is our Resurrection yes your overcoming is our overcoming so Lord right now as a body of Believers we look at you we look at you with eyes of Faith with spiritual eyes around this altar we look to the Lord we look to your word we cannot deny that there are obstacles in the way we cannot deny that there are hindrances in our way but when we see you they get smaller and smaller and smaller before us because you make a way where there is no way you've said to us yes you can and so we say to ourselves oh yes I can Lord if you you had enough confidence in us to call us to this journey then you surely have placed within us the seeds of destiny that we need to overcome in life to not have to depend on pills but our faith in you gets us through Lord I do not believe that it is your will for us to have to depend on man for our overcoming I believe you have made a way Lord help our faith Let It Grow oh God let let us have your faith let us have your faith let that super sense of Faith be upon us so that we can take you at your word no matter what the reports are Lord we choose to believe your word right now would you just lay your hand on someone near you and let's just pray over one another father we pray for each other in the mighty name of Jesus we may not know the depth of the problem we may not know the depth of the battle we may not know the depth of the enemy that this one is facing but Lord we know who you are we know the bigness of our God and we know your ability to help us overcome in every situation of life you're the Healer you're the provider you're the deliverer you're the Savior you're the way maker Lord we come to you right now on behalf of our brothers and sisters in this house and those streaming this service right now now we lift up our faith we join our faith with yours and we believe oh God that our Giants are shrinking that our enemy will drown in the waters of our praise and that we will metaphorically we will eat Giants for our bread they will not stand in our way of inheriting the bridal promises that you have made to us as our inheritance so Lord we don't look at the addiction we don't look at the compulsion we don't look at the predisposition we look at the bigness of our way maker right now and we say yes I can yes I can we don't look at the hopelessness that the enemy has tried to sew into our life that prevailing sadness that tries to follow us like grief we choose right now not to look at that but to look at the comforter the Holy Ghost in US is our comforter and we look to him right now to find comfort in every uncomfortable and painful situation you're the Mighty God hallelujah yes you're the Mighty God you're the mighty God we speak over our own lives right now oh yes I can yes I can and we say to our brother to our sister oh yes you can because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world I can
