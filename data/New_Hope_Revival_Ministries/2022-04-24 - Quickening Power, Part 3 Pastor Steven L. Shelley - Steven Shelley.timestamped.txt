[33:35] [Laughter]

[33:42] [Music]
[33:46] we can't make any apologies
[33:49] we have no apologies to make
[33:52] what they call heresy is the way that i
[33:54] worship my god
[33:57] i just can't help it
[33:59] i was just sensing in the spirit and i
[34:01] know that some of you have been in a
[34:03] battle this week
[34:05] i know that your emotions have been raw
[34:08] and i know that you've been hurting and
[34:10] some grieving and some feeling the loss
[34:13] i know that some have been caught up in
[34:15] a swirl
[34:17] that can really have an effect on you
[34:19] when you come to the house of the lord
[34:21] and
[34:21] i've been watching god minister to
[34:23] different ones and i'm so thrilled
[34:26] and i'd like for us to sing that again
[34:28] and i'm going to pray before we do and
[34:30] i'm going to ask the lord to separate
[34:33] every one of us from all unbelief
[34:35] just to come right in and cut us off
[34:38] from all unbelief
[34:40] let it fall off of us
[34:42] you know that's what the enemy likes to
[34:44] do he likes to to fill us with unbelief
[34:47] to attack us with unbelief to wrap up
[34:50] our minds with unbelief
[34:52] when we come into the presence of the
[34:54] lord then the enemy likes to disqualify
[34:56] us and tell us well you've thought that
[34:59] and you've had this going on and you've
[35:01] been critical and he doesn't want you to
[35:03] get to the presence of god
[35:06] and i believe that we can speak with
[35:08] authority today and cut off
[35:10] all unbelief we're calling for the
[35:13] waters of separation to come this
[35:16] morning and cut us off from all unbelief
[35:19] from all evil
[35:21] we're asking that the waters of
[35:23] separation would come and separate us
[35:26] from all witchcraft break off every
[35:29] curse that's been spoken against your
[35:31] life or against this house or against
[35:34] this ministry because it's the ministry
[35:37] of jesus christ
[35:39] so we're going to believe right now that
[35:41] he will meet you where you are that he
[35:44] will touch you father we thank you for
[35:46] your grace
[35:49] we thank you that the blood paid the
[35:52] price
[35:53] but had it not been for grace
[35:56] the blood couldn't have got to my house
[35:59] it was your grace that was the
[36:01] transportation
[36:03] it was your grace that was the delivery
[36:06] system to deliver the blood of the lamb
[36:08] to my door to my house to my family
[36:12] i want to thank you for the blood but i
[36:15] want to thank you for the grace of god
[36:18] we are not saved by works lest any man
[36:21] should boast we recognize that it is the
[36:24] gift of god so now in the authority of
[36:28] jesus christ we declare right now that
[36:31] we shall be separated from all unbelief
[36:35] that the waters of purity and separation
[36:38] will come and flow over our lives right
[36:41] now wash away the residue of the last
[36:44] battle wash away the residue of the last
[36:47] season and send us forth into a new hour
[36:52] into a new season into a new place in
[36:55] christ we take new ground in the name of
[36:59] the lord jesus christ footsteps means
[37:02] possession we take new inheritance right
[37:05] now we lay claim on old promises and we
[37:09] ask that the spirit of god would quicken
[37:11] them and make them new in our hearts
[37:14] today be free of unbelief
[37:18] be free of condemnation
[37:20] be free of all critical spirits that
[37:23] have worked against you this week and
[37:26] realize that the blood has come the
[37:29] blood has come to set us free the blood
[37:33] can wash away
[37:37] my
[37:38] sin
[37:40] nothing by the blood

[1:34:03] back to the book of beginnings
[1:34:05] let's see where it all started
[1:34:08] and i'll try my best to uh
[1:34:11] to preach a couple of hours
[1:34:13] you thought i was going to say try my
[1:34:15] best to be brief
[1:34:17] but uh
[1:34:18] they tell me that they're celebrating my
[1:34:20] birthday today it's not yet
[1:34:23] although some people have apologized for
[1:34:24] being late we usually have the picnic
[1:34:27] the sunday after but
[1:34:29] uh we had we thought the gree leaves are
[1:34:31] going to be away next sunday it turns
[1:34:32] out they're not and we wanted to have it
[1:34:34] when they could be here as well so it's
[1:34:37] a little early but uh they
[1:34:39] you know i i we always have these
[1:34:41] wonderful fellowships like we had last
[1:34:44] sunday lots of wonderful food and
[1:34:47] the weather's a lot prettier today than
[1:34:49] it was last sunday but the fellowship
[1:34:51] was good i think i left here after nine
[1:34:53] o'clock last sunday night still
[1:34:55] fellowshipping
[1:34:56] wonderful the young people got to
[1:34:58] singing in the portico and they got to
[1:35:00] having jericho marches
[1:35:03] after they'd played their volleyball
[1:35:05] until they could hardly stand up and
[1:35:06] then they were still jericho marching
[1:35:08] and singing and
[1:35:10] i i am wore out when somebody says at
[1:35:13] the end of the night
[1:35:14] what about singing father abraham i mean
[1:35:17] come on
[1:35:19] who in their right mind wants to sing
[1:35:20] that song anyway that's older than three
[1:35:24] but we all
[1:35:26] did you know sometimes it's all right to
[1:35:29] be a little silly
[1:35:31] especially if you're doing it with god's
[1:35:34] people
[1:35:35] and uh we have our serious moments too
[1:35:37] we're entering into one right now
[1:35:39] genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and 27
[1:35:43] um
[1:35:45] i'm gonna i'm going to do some more on
[1:35:47] quickening power
[1:35:49] from last sunday
[1:35:51] and god said let us make man in our
[1:35:55] image
[1:35:57] after our likeness
[1:35:59] and let them have dominion over the fish
[1:36:02] of the sea
[1:36:03] and over the fowl of the air and over
[1:36:06] the cattle
[1:36:08] and over all the earth and over every
[1:36:11] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[1:36:14] earth
[1:36:15] and so god created man
[1:36:18] in his own image i want you to say own
[1:36:21] image
[1:36:23] in the image of god created he him
[1:36:28] male and female
[1:36:30] created he
[1:36:32] them
[1:36:32] [Music]
[1:36:34] now in genesis 2 19 if you'll go there
[1:36:37] before you
[1:36:39] before we have a word of prayer and you
[1:36:41] take your seat
[1:36:43] and out of the ground the lord god
[1:36:45] formed every beast of the field
[1:36:49] every fowl of the air and brought them
[1:36:51] unto adam
[1:36:53] to see what he would call them
[1:36:56] and whatsoever adam called every living
[1:37:00] creature that was the name thereof
[1:37:04] you see adam was already demonstrating
[1:37:07] the authority and the dominion that god
[1:37:10] had given him in the earth
[1:37:12] the very name adam means red earth
[1:37:17] he's from the red dirt and yet his body
[1:37:21] fashioned in the image and in the
[1:37:23] likeness of god god himself breathed
[1:37:26] breath his breath
[1:37:28] ruach hakodesh
[1:37:30] the breath of god was breathed into adam
[1:37:33] and he became a living
[1:37:36] soul
[1:37:37] he was connected now
[1:37:40] to his atmosphere
[1:37:42] around him by the soul the soul
[1:37:46] connected spirit and flesh together
[1:37:50] and the senses of the soul gave adam the
[1:37:53] ability to be in contact with the
[1:37:56] environment around him now god was a
[1:37:59] good god to make adam have the ability
[1:38:02] through the spirit to be connected to
[1:38:04] him
[1:38:05] and through the soul to be connected to
[1:38:07] the environment and the atmosphere
[1:38:10] around him god's just a good god isn't
[1:38:12] he
[1:38:13] let's bow our heads father
[1:38:15] we thank you today that you are god's
[1:38:18] sovereign
[1:38:19] you are god's supreme
[1:38:21] last sunday it was raining on the
[1:38:23] outside
[1:38:25] this sunday it's been raining on the
[1:38:27] inside
[1:38:28] how we want to thank you for that holy
[1:38:31] reign
[1:38:32] we're just not ashamed of your presence
[1:38:34] or how we respond
[1:38:36] we just do the best we can
[1:38:39] and what might have been observed today
[1:38:42] across the internet it was really us
[1:38:45] trying to behave ourselves
[1:38:47] if we should ever really turn loose
[1:38:52] then even the molecules of our body
[1:38:54] would be changed and we would be
[1:38:56] raptured out of here in a glorious
[1:38:59] translation power
[1:39:01] we look forward to that day
[1:39:04] where every molecule of this body will
[1:39:06] speed up and we will be changed
[1:39:10] from all that is of the earth
[1:39:13] to all that is of the heavenly
[1:39:15] oh god help us today as we study your
[1:39:18] word the people have experienced you
[1:39:21] but in that experience our bodies get
[1:39:24] tired
[1:39:25] and we may already be a little weary in
[1:39:27] mind but we need to feast on the living
[1:39:30] word of god today
[1:39:32] because a feeling like we had in worship
[1:39:35] will come and it will fade but when we
[1:39:39] come under the inspiration of revelation
[1:39:42] the stimulation that it provides is not
[1:39:46] momentarily and it never expires but it
[1:39:49] builds us
[1:39:51] into a higher and higher resurrection
[1:39:54] life
[1:39:55] we ask for your help today
[1:39:57] in the name that is above every name the
[1:40:00] name of our messiah the lord jesus
[1:40:03] christ and the church said
[1:40:06] you may be seated this morning to all of
[1:40:09] our wonderful friends
[1:40:11] around the world we bless you today
[1:40:14] for streaming this service
[1:40:17] and we have folks from
[1:40:19] ghana and indiana and washington and
[1:40:22] kentucky
[1:40:24] we see more from indiana we see some
[1:40:27] rather local
[1:40:29] we we see some i don't know i just can't
[1:40:32] remember to be honest with you where
[1:40:34] some of these precious folks are from
[1:40:37] tucson is represented more than once
[1:40:39] belgium is represented
[1:40:41] brazil is represented
[1:40:46] trinidad is represented in
[1:40:49] netherlands
[1:40:51] south africa
[1:40:54] if you're watching on facebook or on
[1:40:56] youtube why don't you just put in your
[1:40:58] country i know i shouldn't remember it
[1:41:02] but i
[1:41:02] don't
[1:41:04] i see that a sister has identified
[1:41:06] herself let me see if i can
[1:41:08] as part of an end time message
[1:41:10] congregation in israel god bless you
[1:41:14] you're particularly dear to our heart
[1:41:17] we appreciate you being here
[1:41:19] with us through the stream
[1:41:22] now we just read the scripture how that
[1:41:24] god created adam in his own image and in
[1:41:27] his likeness
[1:41:28] he fashioned him from the earth but he
[1:41:31] lay there just a shell of a man
[1:41:34] he wasn't able to do what god did he
[1:41:37] just lay there in the image of god
[1:41:40] but god wasn't finished with creation he
[1:41:42] came himself he bowed low he breathed
[1:41:46] his own breath into the nostrils of adam
[1:41:50] and adam became a living soul
[1:41:53] this i said just a moment ago connected
[1:41:55] to the father by his spirit connected to
[1:41:58] the world around him and to his own
[1:42:00] flesh through the five senses of his
[1:42:03] soul
[1:42:04] if you're listening today and you need
[1:42:05] to
[1:42:06] to exchange those
[1:42:08] you can do that because i know that
[1:42:11] people have different ideas
[1:42:13] i just choose to call it like the
[1:42:15] scripture said body soul spirit we're
[1:42:18] just using the order that's in the
[1:42:20] scripture but you can if you need to
[1:42:22] flip those words for your understanding
[1:42:25] you can certainly do that
[1:42:27] but i'm so glad that god gave us
[1:42:29] spiritual senses
[1:42:31] to be connected to him
[1:42:33] in spirit
[1:42:35] because there's a fellowship that
[1:42:37] doesn't come flesh to spirit it must be
[1:42:40] spirit to spirit
[1:42:43] you don't understand that until you've
[1:42:45] experienced it
[1:42:47] like benjamin was testifying a minute
[1:42:49] ago until you felt that until you have
[1:42:52] experienced that it may look like the
[1:42:55] craziest thing that you've ever seen but
[1:42:58] once you have tasted it one time
[1:43:02] for yourself
[1:43:04] you'll never be satisfied with dry dusty
[1:43:07] religion
[1:43:08] you'll never be satisfied with form or
[1:43:11] fashion
[1:43:12] you'll never be satisfied with man's
[1:43:15] religion again
[1:43:17] once you taste the real and i want you
[1:43:20] to know he's very much real
[1:43:22] he is very much alive
[1:43:25] when god created adam
[1:43:28] in the earth he gave him dominion over
[1:43:30] all the things that were on the earth
[1:43:33] by the power of the spoken word adam
[1:43:37] exercise that dominion in whatever way
[1:43:40] was necessary
[1:43:41] perhaps eve you know how a wife can be
[1:43:46] eve was probably sitting out on the
[1:43:48] patio one
[1:43:49] one day and uh taking a little little
[1:43:52] breather maybe you know just enjoying
[1:43:54] the beauty of what god had made
[1:43:58] there was there was work in the garden
[1:44:00] but not labor
[1:44:04] there's a difference if you enjoy what
[1:44:07] you're doing
[1:44:08] there's no toil involved
[1:44:11] and so there was no toil involved in
[1:44:13] everything that adam and eve did the
[1:44:15] bible said that adam was placed there to
[1:44:18] tin the garden so he was doing something
[1:44:21] he wasn't just watching at all he was
[1:44:23] doing something but there was such
[1:44:25] fulfillment
[1:44:27] in doing what god had created him to do
[1:44:30] and in exercising order and dominion
[1:44:32] over creation he was so joyful to be
[1:44:36] able to do that there was no sweat there
[1:44:38] was no toil there was no real hard
[1:44:41] effort involved
[1:44:43] one day eve is sitting on the back patio
[1:44:46] perhaps and
[1:44:47] and she's thinking in her mind you know
[1:44:50] like a woman does in the living room
[1:44:53] i don't know if it's like this at your
[1:44:55] house but i can go to work and come home
[1:44:58] and we've remodeled
[1:45:03] couch is moved chairs moved
[1:45:06] just when you get used to it brother
[1:45:08] steve just like you want it
[1:45:10] i need a little table there for my water
[1:45:12] bottle i need certain things
[1:45:15] and then you come home and i guess i
[1:45:17] shouldn't complain because
[1:45:19] i don't come home and meet a honey-do
[1:45:21] list where she said can you move that
[1:45:23] there can you move that there can you do
[1:45:25] that she just gets in and makes sure
[1:45:26] it's done she just does it herself
[1:45:29] i'm kind of thinking that eve liked to
[1:45:32] rearrange things
[1:45:34] and i'm thinking that maybe eve was
[1:45:36] sitting on the back patio
[1:45:38] uh one evening and she thought my
[1:45:42] if i only had an orange tree
[1:45:44] closer to the patio
[1:45:48] so that i don't have to go out so far
[1:45:51] it's about 50 yards out through there to
[1:45:53] pick an orange how i would love to relax
[1:45:57] here on the chase lounge and just be
[1:46:00] able to reach up from my chair
[1:46:02] and pick me a fresh orange and just peel
[1:46:06] it and enjoy it and she said adam
[1:46:10] can you put me an orange tree
[1:46:12] right there butt it up right against the
[1:46:15] patio oh of course dear
[1:46:18] i can
[1:46:20] how many of you know adam didn't need a
[1:46:22] shovel
[1:46:24] he didn't need to go down to the to the
[1:46:27] nursery to buy an orange tree
[1:46:30] he didn't have to buy fertilizer
[1:46:32] he didn't have to get out the garden
[1:46:34] cart
[1:46:36] he didn't have to put on the gloves he
[1:46:38] didn't have to do all that he just said
[1:46:40] sure dear where did you say you would
[1:46:42] like it
[1:46:45] and because he was given dominion
[1:46:49] he just spoke the word
[1:46:53] i don't know where that orange tree came
[1:46:55] from
[1:46:56] it might have been out in the woods
[1:46:58] somewhere out in the but i want you to
[1:47:00] know it plucked itself
[1:47:03] somebody said i can't accept that don't
[1:47:05] matter whether you accept it or not it's
[1:47:06] the order of god's creation
[1:47:08] it just pulled up his roots
[1:47:13] somebody said no wonder you're talking
[1:47:15] about narnia
[1:47:17] where the trees move
[1:47:18] oh
[1:47:20] i feel good anyway that tree just poked
[1:47:22] up picked up its roots
[1:47:25] just scooted right over there
[1:47:28] and adam said there
[1:47:31] and that tree just shot its roots down
[1:47:34] into that dirt smile the big old smile
[1:47:38] because he knew that the one who had
[1:47:42] been given dominion over him
[1:47:44] had had utilized that authority and
[1:47:47] dominion and placed him now where a son
[1:47:50] of god wanted him to be
[1:47:52] anybody with me
[1:47:55] you mean you really believe such a thing
[1:47:57] as that with all my heart
[1:47:59] i in fact i just read to you in 219
[1:48:03] but out of the very ground god took the
[1:48:05] ground
[1:48:06] from the ground and he began to create
[1:48:08] every beast
[1:48:11] every elephant
[1:48:14] every tiger
[1:48:16] every lion
[1:48:19] satan is not a creator
[1:48:22] god was creating
[1:48:25] he was using adam
[1:48:27] who was an amateur god
[1:48:33] made in the image and the likeness of
[1:48:35] god
[1:48:36] filled with the very zoe life of god
[1:48:39] speaking the mind of god isn't that
[1:48:41] powerful
[1:48:42] that's what it was
[1:48:44] and so he just god began to create these
[1:48:47] animals and they're just roaming around
[1:48:49] and
[1:48:50] and adam and eve are just sitting on the
[1:48:52] patio watching a big old elephant walk
[1:48:54] by
[1:48:55] swinging in his trunk
[1:48:58] i wonder what that eve said adam wonder
[1:49:00] what that is
[1:49:02] i don't know
[1:49:04] i don't know the kind of time came
[1:49:07] and they looked out and there was a line
[1:49:09] of animals
[1:49:11] they were lined up as far as the eye
[1:49:12] could see
[1:49:14] it was like a prayer line in a brother
[1:49:16] ran a meeting
[1:49:18] just as far as the eye could see they
[1:49:20] were lined up to pass by the son of god
[1:49:22] to find out what their name was
[1:49:26] is that not right because god brought
[1:49:28] those beasts of the field to adam
[1:49:32] and god didn't say adam
[1:49:39] look at what he said
[1:49:41] he brought them unto adam
[1:49:44] to see what he would call them
[1:49:50] god didn't whisper adam call it a tiger
[1:49:54] god just let adam do some uh exercising
[1:49:58] some dominion here
[1:50:00] and god adam said i'm gonna call that a
[1:50:03] tiger and god said that is exactly what
[1:50:06] i was going to call it
[1:50:11] adam said i think i'll call that thing
[1:50:13] there an elephant and god said that is
[1:50:15] exactly what i was going to call it
[1:50:18] and you say how in the world is that
[1:50:20] possible because adam
[1:50:22] was created in the image and likeness of
[1:50:25] god
[1:50:27] filled with the very zoy life the very
[1:50:29] ruach breath of god
[1:50:32] he had the mind of god
[1:50:35] he had the voice to speak for god
[1:50:39] he was filled with the power of the
[1:50:41] spoken word
[1:50:46] you do understand
[1:50:49] that if there hadn't been an orange tree
[1:50:51] available
[1:50:54] he could have made one
[1:51:00] because the creator was in his mouth
[1:51:04] you remember what brother branham said
[1:51:06] about the power of the spoken word
[1:51:08] and how that little bride would have
[1:51:11] that authority
[1:51:13] in the last days
[1:51:15] how she would depend on thus saith the
[1:51:18] lord and without the saith the lord she
[1:51:21] would keep still
[1:51:23] but when thus saith the lord would drop
[1:51:26] down on her she would be able to speak
[1:51:30] the mind of god the creative spoken word
[1:51:35] of god and everything would have to obey
[1:51:38] that
[1:51:39] somebody said i just can't quite get my
[1:51:41] brain around that well
[1:51:43] you might ought to
[1:51:46] because it's part of your inheritance
[1:51:49] and i'm happen to believe not only when
[1:51:51] we live in millennium and not only when
[1:51:54] we leave this world in rapture but i
[1:51:56] happen to believe that there will be a
[1:51:58] fully mature bride of sons
[1:52:03] there'll be a fully mature body of sons
[1:52:05] on the earth in the last days
[1:52:08] that's genderless that's not male or
[1:52:10] female if if men can be the bride then
[1:52:14] sisters can be part of sons
[1:52:17] it's two sides of the same paradigm
[1:52:20] and that full authority that comes to us
[1:52:24] through the completed adoption
[1:52:27] will be exercised out of our mouth
[1:52:31] and when this little bride goes forth in
[1:52:33] the power of the spoken word listen i'm
[1:52:35] not one of those who says one of these
[1:52:37] days when it comes
[1:52:41] or or what they used to like to say when
[1:52:43] it's restored
[1:52:45] i want you to know i'm not waiting for
[1:52:48] it
[1:52:49] i'm waiting for permission
[1:52:55] i don't want to venture without
[1:52:56] authority
[1:52:58] i want to know when the season is
[1:53:01] when the hour is you won't have to go
[1:53:04] looking for it or sit around waiting on
[1:53:06] it because the word has restored it in
[1:53:09] our day
[1:53:10] anybody with me
[1:53:12] the spoken word has been restored in our
[1:53:15] day
[1:53:16] brother branham saw it in his own
[1:53:18] ministry at least five separate
[1:53:20] designated times
[1:53:23] and then every one of those times god
[1:53:26] gave him authority
[1:53:28] over certain facets of creation
[1:53:32] one of those was healing
[1:53:34] before the doctor's hand ever touches
[1:53:36] your body
[1:53:38] that tumor is going to disappear
[1:53:41] how many of you think that could come in
[1:53:42] handy
[1:53:45] he spoke the word and god did exactly
[1:53:49] what he spoke
[1:53:51] old sister had he write
[1:53:53] hattie mosher
[1:53:55] she had
[1:53:56] two sons
[1:53:58] as you well know that were rebellious
[1:54:00] boys just in the beginning of teens
[1:54:04] and they were already rebelling and
[1:54:07] they weren't as interested in what she
[1:54:09] was interested in
[1:54:11] brother branham is sitting around the
[1:54:13] table there and he is giving the story
[1:54:16] of how god had come down there in the
[1:54:18] hollow in kentucky and created squirrel
[1:54:22] in such a way brother branham was giving
[1:54:25] god a hard time at it you know he didn't
[1:54:27] make it easy
[1:54:28] [Music]
[1:54:31] he chose to put a squirrel in a place
[1:54:33] where a squirrel wouldn't normally run
[1:54:37] and and god did it just like he put the
[1:54:40] ram in the thicket for abraham god did
[1:54:43] it that day somebody said you don't
[1:54:45] really believe that do you with all my
[1:54:46] heart
[1:54:48] yes i believe two different times he
[1:54:50] exercised that creation ability
[1:54:53] to speak a squirrel into existence and
[1:54:55] it appeared can anybody think of a time
[1:54:58] that that might be
[1:55:00] coming in handy in the latter days these
[1:55:02] last days that we live here on the earth
[1:55:05] it might be a very important thing to
[1:55:07] know that god can do through you i hope
[1:55:09] i'm not saying too much for you
[1:55:11] and he's sitting around that little
[1:55:13] table and they're sharing these
[1:55:15] testimonies and
[1:55:16] sister weems and sister royale hold up
[1:55:19] your hand sisters because there's some
[1:55:21] that may not know exactly who you are
[1:55:24] but
[1:55:25] these sisters knew sister hattie wright
[1:55:27] very well and sister royale spent the
[1:55:30] night at sister hattie's house and so
[1:55:32] you know we can get up and tell
[1:55:34] testimonies of which we have no
[1:55:35] connection to but doesn't it make it
[1:55:38] even more special when someone you know
[1:55:41] knew the sister
[1:55:43] and knew what god did i'm assuming you
[1:55:46] met the sons i'm assuming you met those
[1:55:48] boys as well
[1:55:51] sister hattie is listening carefully
[1:55:53] while while trying to to serve the table
[1:55:58] and she
[1:55:59] is hearing carefully what brother
[1:56:01] branham is describing about this
[1:56:03] creation
[1:56:04] and she said just a very ignorant woman
[1:56:06] just a very a country woman
[1:56:10] they didn't even raise their children
[1:56:12] with indoor plumbing
[1:56:15] they didn't have any indoor plumbing
[1:56:17] until the deacons at the branham
[1:56:19] tabernacle got together and put them
[1:56:21] some plumbing in their home
[1:56:23] they were still using an outhouse
[1:56:26] i got to tell the story
[1:56:30] she
[1:56:31] you know used uh
[1:56:32] newspapers for her tablecloths
[1:56:37] and she had layers of newspaper on the
[1:56:40] table
[1:56:41] and would just when one got soiled she'd
[1:56:43] just rip it off and and there would be
[1:56:46] another well sister royale was just a
[1:56:47] young girl about how old would she have
[1:56:49] been
[1:56:52] just a teenager and she spent the night
[1:56:54] there with sister hattie and
[1:56:56] they
[1:56:58] they had served squash pie i think it
[1:57:01] was
[1:57:02] and sister royale wasn't real fond of
[1:57:05] squash pie
[1:57:07] i think i might would have liked it i
[1:57:10] might have had a little trouble with the
[1:57:11] possum or something but i i think i
[1:57:13] could have eaten the squash pie
[1:57:15] sister royale took a little piece of
[1:57:17] that
[1:57:18] and she and she tucked it under the new
[1:57:20] some of the layers of the newspaper and
[1:57:23] i think it came out and she felt bad
[1:57:26] about doing it
[1:57:27] and sister had he said oh honey she said
[1:57:30] i don't care about the squash pie i just
[1:57:32] hate it messed up my my newspapers
[1:57:38] that's just how simple she was
[1:57:41] but she heard that
[1:57:43] i don't know whether she fully
[1:57:44] understood it or not
[1:57:47] but she heard it and something in her
[1:57:50] inner being lived with joy
[1:57:54] because that day in her kitchen jesus
[1:57:58] christ had updated himself
[1:58:01] and the god of the bible had become a
[1:58:04] living reality
[1:58:06] and she said my if god is doing that for
[1:58:10] abraham and now he's doing it in our day
[1:58:13] and the next thing you know she screamed
[1:58:15] out brother branham that ain't nothing
[1:58:18] but the truth
[1:58:21] that was her amen
[1:58:24] she could not theologically dissect the
[1:58:27] hermeneutics or homiletics of that
[1:58:29] happening
[1:58:31] she didn't know how
[1:58:33] to to break it down and chain the
[1:58:35] scriptures together and present it but
[1:58:37] all she knew was something
[1:58:43] something on the inside of her said that
[1:58:45] ain't nothing but the truth
[1:58:48] that anointing of god fell down on
[1:58:50] brother branham as he's telling about
[1:58:51] one of the experiences
[1:58:54] of the spoken word there was the storm
[1:58:57] that was calmed
[1:58:59] later there was a little fish that was
[1:59:01] given his life back
[1:59:04] resurrection power lays in the spoken
[1:59:06] word
[1:59:09] authority over the elements
[1:59:12] lays in the spoken word
[1:59:14] creation power lays in the spoken word
[1:59:20] you with me
[1:59:22] and then all of a sudden that anointing
[1:59:23] falls on brother branham just like it
[1:59:25] did out there on the lake
[1:59:28] when he stood up and looked at that
[1:59:30] little sunfish
[1:59:32] and said i give you your life
[1:59:34] little fishy i give you your life
[1:59:36] somebody said that's about the silliest
[1:59:38] little story i've ever heard you know
[1:59:39] what
[1:59:40] it may be to you
[1:59:42] but it says to me that the very power of
[1:59:45] the resurrection will abide in the
[1:59:47] little bride of jesus christ in the last
[1:59:50] days and death will not be able to stand
[1:59:52] before her
[1:59:54] you see i'm one of those that believe
[1:59:56] the devil can't take me before my time
[2:00:00] i happen to believe in the sovereignty
[2:00:02] of god
[2:00:04] and i'm hoping and believing that if i
[2:00:06] should leave here by some by some chance
[2:00:09] before my time has come i'm hoping and
[2:00:11] praying that you will raise up
[2:00:15] i'll try to do the same for you
[2:00:18] if we sense it's not your time yet i
[2:00:21] pray somebody will raise up and say i
[2:00:23] give you your life in the name of jesus
[2:00:26] christ somebody said you wouldn't expect
[2:00:28] anything to happen would you i would
[2:00:32] i would
[2:00:34] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[2:00:37] today and forever
[2:00:40] can anybody say anything
[2:00:43] amen
[2:00:44] and so
[2:00:45] that anointing fell on brother branham
[2:00:48] and he stood up and he said
[2:00:51] god is going to give you
[2:00:53] the desire
[2:00:54] of your heart i'm paraphrasing this
[2:00:58] she didn't even know what to ask
[2:01:01] in one of the tellings she said brother
[2:01:03] branham i don't even know what to ask
[2:01:04] for
[2:01:06] brother branham said she could have
[2:01:07] asked for 10 million dollars and it
[2:01:09] would have fell out of the ceiling and
[2:01:10] into her lap
[2:01:12] just telling you what he said
[2:01:15] she was a poor woman
[2:01:17] she could have used some of that money
[2:01:19] edith anne her sister was a crippled she
[2:01:21] had a lot of things wrong with her and
[2:01:23] her mom and dad were still alive at that
[2:01:25] time and they were invalid almost and
[2:01:28] and so all these different things were
[2:01:30] going on in her mind and and she's
[2:01:32] having this little conversation with
[2:01:33] brother adam and standing in the doorway
[2:01:36] hear this if you've got some lost loved
[2:01:38] ones
[2:01:39] hear this if you've got some backsliders
[2:01:41] in your family hear this
[2:01:45] and standing in the door of that old
[2:01:47] country home where were her two sons and
[2:01:49] they were laughing
[2:01:51] and they were making fun charity you
[2:01:53] might put their you might be able to
[2:01:54] find their picture there and put it up
[2:01:56] we've done it in the past
[2:01:58] you might be able to put the picture of
[2:01:59] the boys up
[2:02:01] maybe there's there's a picture of him
[2:02:02] standing side by side and there's also
[2:02:04] one a picture of one of them getting
[2:02:05] baptized
[2:02:07] they're standing there in the door and
[2:02:09] they're snickering
[2:02:11] brother branham called him a name what
[2:02:13] did he
[2:02:14] snicker fritz how in the world do you
[2:02:16] remember that you remember me reading
[2:02:18] that in africa
[2:02:19] he said there were just two little
[2:02:20] snicker fritts
[2:02:26] i'm not sure what the glossary term on
[2:02:28] that is or you
[2:02:29] but i kind of get it two little snicker
[2:02:32] fritz voice standing there making fun of
[2:02:35] this religious talk
[2:02:38] and sister hattie looks over and sees
[2:02:40] him carrying on that way and she said oh
[2:02:42] brother branham
[2:02:44] i want the salvation of my two boys
[2:02:51] oh there they are
[2:02:54] that's sister hattie in the middle and
[2:02:55] her two sons
[2:02:58] standing beside her at the old
[2:02:59] tabernacle
[2:03:02] i want the salvation of my two boys
[2:03:05] and brother branham under the
[2:03:07] inspiration of that anointing said i
[2:03:10] give them to you
[2:03:12] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:03:15] somebody said ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
[2:03:21] somebody said how is that possible
[2:03:23] did brother branham save him no he
[2:03:25] called them to salvation
[2:03:27] and the spirit of conviction fell in
[2:03:30] that room on those boys and they weren't
[2:03:32] praying
[2:03:34] they were laughing
[2:03:35] they were making fun
[2:03:37] and all of a sudden they come under that
[2:03:39] conviction power and they're standing
[2:03:42] three minutes ago in the doorway
[2:03:44] laughing and making fun and now they are
[2:03:46] both laying over their mother's lap
[2:03:50] weeping
[2:03:52] and repenting
[2:03:54] and asking jesus to come into their life
[2:03:57] is anybody with me
[2:03:59] [Applause]
[2:04:02] you see i believe
[2:04:04] that there are those out there held
[2:04:07] in
[2:04:08] unbelief for this season
[2:04:11] [Applause]
[2:04:13] we've prayed for them and we've prayed
[2:04:15] for them and we've prayed for them but
[2:04:17] they're being held and i know i even
[2:04:19] know the reason why
[2:04:21] some of them have been held
[2:04:23] because you and i have been on such a
[2:04:25] long journey here through church
[2:04:27] you see we had to get through church
[2:04:29] before we could know who we are in the
[2:04:31] kingdom
[2:04:32] we've been making our way through the
[2:04:33] church ages
[2:04:35] god's been calling us from one baptism
[2:04:38] to another baptism to another baptism
[2:04:41] and we've been walking in our spiritual
[2:04:43] journey through the church ages getting
[2:04:45] closer and closer to the restoration of
[2:04:47] all things
[2:04:48] the first time i heard about jesus was
[2:04:50] from a baptist grandmother
[2:04:53] but my baptist grandmother didn't take
[2:04:55] me all the way
[2:04:57] she could only bring me so far
[2:04:59] they took me to sunday school at the
[2:05:01] baptist church and her sister was my
[2:05:03] sunday school teacher and it was there
[2:05:05] that i sung for the first time my prayer
[2:05:08] come into my heart
[2:05:10] come into my heart lord jesus
[2:05:12] but i couldn't stay in that little first
[2:05:14] grade kindergarten sunday school class
[2:05:17] the rest of my life god had to lead me
[2:05:20] he led me a little higher and he
[2:05:21] baptized me with the holy ghost when i
[2:05:23] was seven years old filled me with his
[2:05:25] glory and called me to preach and sent
[2:05:27] me to do a work for him that was getting
[2:05:30] me closer
[2:05:31] i don't want to give my testimony this
[2:05:33] morning but he took me closer and closer
[2:05:35] and closer we're making our way through
[2:05:37] the church ages
[2:05:38] we're coming from baptism to baptism
[2:05:41] we're moving from one glory to another
[2:05:44] glory one faith to another faith
[2:05:47] one strength to another strength
[2:05:51] then we heard the message
[2:05:53] when i heard this message of truth it
[2:05:55] changed my life forevermore
[2:05:58] it cost me more friends than i even knew
[2:06:00] i had
[2:06:02] didn't even know i had that many friends
[2:06:04] till i lost them
[2:06:05] it cost me it cost me it'll cost you too
[2:06:09] it'll cost you if you believe the bible
[2:06:11] if you believe that a second book of
[2:06:12] acts is being written in this hour like
[2:06:14] i do it'll cost you
[2:06:17] it'll cost you something
[2:06:19] you may not be called a snicker fritz
[2:06:21] but you'll be called a holy roller
[2:06:26] just recently i heard about a sister
[2:06:29] who uh
[2:06:30] someone said about her they said well i
[2:06:33] they heard that she'd been drinking from
[2:06:35] the well down here
[2:06:37] and somebody said about her i don't know
[2:06:39] as conservative if she is
[2:06:42] i don't know how in the world she could
[2:06:45] you know get involved in all of that
[2:06:47] noise all that carrying on or whatever
[2:06:49] the expression was a church like that
[2:06:52] or whatever it was
[2:06:54] if that's the worst thing that's ever
[2:06:56] said about that little lady she'll be
[2:06:58] all right
[2:06:59] but i tell you it won't be
[2:07:02] they'll say that about you they'll say
[2:07:04] more about you
[2:07:06] you'll have to sing the little song i've
[2:07:07] been singing all my life folks may false
[2:07:10] accuse me and scandalize my name but i'm
[2:07:13] going on with jesus
[2:07:16] you see we're just making a journey
[2:07:19] we're following the pillar of fire
[2:07:22] anybody with me
[2:07:24] getting closer all the time
[2:07:28] and i thought i had found it all when i
[2:07:30] found the message of the hour
[2:07:32] and then i
[2:07:34] and then i bumped into the people
[2:07:40] people just ruin everything
[2:07:44] yes we do
[2:07:46] we can just ruin anything
[2:07:48] you know people can ruin a good party
[2:07:53] they can ruin a good chocolate cake
[2:07:57] don't tell me your health tips while i'm
[2:07:59] eating chocolate cake
[2:08:02] wait till i'm done
[2:08:04] have you no shame
[2:08:09] i don't drink diet drinks again
[2:08:11] now anymore i hadn't drank them in years
[2:08:14] but i used to drink diet drinks i knew
[2:08:16] they weren't good for me
[2:08:20] i knew the leaded version wasn't good
[2:08:21] for me either
[2:08:23] but i you go off of cokes if you drink a
[2:08:26] lot of cokes i did then i don't now
[2:08:29] i did then and you go off of cokes and
[2:08:31] going to diet cost a little just a
[2:08:32] little while i lost 10 pounds doing
[2:08:34] nothing but going off of cokes
[2:08:36] i knew it wasn't the best
[2:08:39] i knew i'd read all the articles
[2:08:43] but i was over in israel i don't
[2:08:44] remember who was with me i was over in
[2:08:46] israel and we were witnessing to some
[2:08:48] croatian brothers and we had baptized
[2:08:50] them in the bathtub
[2:08:51] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[2:08:54] they're sitting around
[2:08:55] talking about how bad that diet coke was
[2:08:58] i wanted to pour it right on his head
[2:09:01] wait till i'm not thirsty to tell me
[2:09:04] folks if you if people are involved in
[2:09:06] something they can just ruin it
[2:09:10] and so i went through a period of time
[2:09:12] where i was dissuaded a little bit
[2:09:14] discouraged because i couldn't see the
[2:09:17] message producing as much as i thought
[2:09:20] it should be producing
[2:09:22] and then i realized i was in the same
[2:09:24] boat
[2:09:26] i was still hung somewhere back in
[2:09:28] pentecost just trying to make my way to
[2:09:30] a deeper truth come on now we're all on
[2:09:33] a journey
[2:09:35] and so you have to get your eyes off of
[2:09:37] people
[2:09:39] let me give you three steps to
[2:09:41] overcoming
[2:09:43] number one get your eyes off of people
[2:09:45] keep your eyes on jesus
[2:09:47] number two get your eyes off people keep
[2:09:50] your eyes on jesus
[2:09:51] number three get your eyes on people
[2:09:54] keep your eyes on jesus
[2:09:56] that's three steps to overcoming in this
[2:09:58] last hour it'll work every time get your
[2:10:01] eyes off of people
[2:10:04] and get your eyes on jesus
[2:10:06] because he never fails
[2:10:08] he never fails
[2:10:10] well i want you to know there came a
[2:10:11] time that adam's authority and dominion
[2:10:14] over that garden you know how sweet it
[2:10:15] was i'm not here to talk about that you
[2:10:18] know how wonderful that fellowship was
[2:10:20] god himself came down in the cool of
[2:10:22] every evening and had this glorious
[2:10:24] fellowship with adam and eve oh my can
[2:10:27] you imagine walking with him in the
[2:10:29] stillness of the garden
[2:10:31] oh having such sweet fellowship we know
[2:10:34] how sweet it is when we get in his
[2:10:36] presence around here but all to think
[2:10:38] about him coming
[2:10:40] and lingering
[2:10:43] i i often think about what it would have
[2:10:44] been like for adam and eve when when
[2:10:47] when papa said
[2:10:48] i'm going now
[2:10:55] oh don't go away
[2:10:57] papa sit with us a little while longer
[2:10:59] come on now
[2:11:00] sit with us a little while longer
[2:11:03] just give us 10 more minutes
[2:11:06] you don't really have to go
[2:11:09] the whole universe is running while
[2:11:10] you're sitting here fellowshipping oh
[2:11:13] please don't go
[2:11:14] but the bible said he didn't and he did
[2:11:16] it for a reason
[2:11:19] it every reason
[2:11:20] he had an appointment he kept
[2:11:22] disappointment
[2:11:24] i can see adam and eve running out naked
[2:11:27] as they came into the earth
[2:11:29] running out to meet papa
[2:11:32] when he would come they're waiting on
[2:11:34] him they're ready to see him oh papa
[2:11:37] it's so good you're here we're so glad
[2:11:39] you're here we're looking forward to
[2:11:40] this evening of fellowship
[2:11:42] come on
[2:11:44] neither one of them even realized that
[2:11:46] they were naked because they were
[2:11:47] covered with god's great cosmic light
[2:11:51] the light was just emanating they only
[2:11:53] had knowledge of good
[2:11:55] they only knew the good they only knew
[2:11:57] the god
[2:11:59] they had not yet tasted of that tree
[2:12:01] that gave them the ability to see that
[2:12:04] there's something else it was all they
[2:12:07] knew
[2:12:08] they were naked and not ashamed
[2:12:10] anybody with me
[2:12:12] and then all of a sudden you know what
[2:12:14] happened satan entered in
[2:12:16] to that creature that beast of the of
[2:12:19] the garden of eden who walked upright
[2:12:21] like a man
[2:12:23] looked like a man
[2:12:25] had reasoning ability it seems
[2:12:28] but he had no soul
[2:12:31] satan was not going to be able to inject
[2:12:34] himself
[2:12:35] into mankind
[2:12:37] and so he had to find a way
[2:12:40] and he found a willing
[2:12:42] vessel
[2:12:44] may i remind you one that was created
[2:12:46] for that purpose
[2:12:48] may i help you to understand that god
[2:12:50] created the beast
[2:12:52] that would we would understand to be the
[2:12:54] serpent
[2:12:55] and he created him knowing exactly that
[2:12:57] he would volunteer and make himself
[2:12:59] available the same god created judas
[2:13:04] knowing that judas was going to betray
[2:13:06] the lord
[2:13:07] come on now
[2:13:08] the same god that created evil in the
[2:13:10] first place according to the prophet of
[2:13:12] the old testament and he did that to
[2:13:14] drive us closer to his bosom
[2:13:17] not to pull us further away
[2:13:19] anybody's still here this morning
[2:13:22] and so you know what happened there was
[2:13:23] an act that took place
[2:13:25] in the garden you can you can
[2:13:28] you know you can figure that out on your
[2:13:29] own or we'll talk to you about it i'm
[2:13:31] not ashamed to preach about it i just
[2:13:33] don't want to throw people this morning
[2:13:35] because that's not where we're going
[2:13:37] but i'll tell you what it boiled down to
[2:13:39] it boiled down to believe ah eve
[2:13:42] believing a lie
[2:13:46] she couldn't understand why god would
[2:13:48] lie to them
[2:13:50] it opened the door
[2:13:53] and she began to listen to reasoning
[2:13:56] and reasoning will take you further and
[2:13:58] further away from the presence of god
[2:14:02] every time somebody say every time
[2:14:04] you've got to get human reasoning shut
[2:14:06] down and you've got to approach god with
[2:14:08] faith you can never approach god with
[2:14:10] human reasoning you'll never get
[2:14:12] anywhere but if you'll rep if you will
[2:14:14] approach him with faith you'll be able
[2:14:16] to understand as he reveals himself to
[2:14:18] you is that right
[2:14:20] and so you know the reasoning was there
[2:14:22] and she began to to believe and he began
[2:14:24] to introduce to her a way for a higher
[2:14:26] life
[2:14:28] you you you just listen to me and i'll
[2:14:30] take you to a higher place when i'm done
[2:14:33] you'll be just like god she didn't
[2:14:35] realize
[2:14:37] that she had come forth from the one
[2:14:39] that was made in the image and in the
[2:14:42] likeness of god she didn't understand
[2:14:45] that she was hidden in the original
[2:14:46] creation she just didn't have it all
[2:14:49] figured out
[2:14:51] she was a byproduct of the man
[2:14:54] you know that every time a copy is made
[2:14:56] it gets further away from the original
[2:14:58] identity
[2:14:59] and she was created
[2:15:02] and left with a vulnerability
[2:15:06] so that she could believe this lie
[2:15:09] she gave herself to the lie
[2:15:12] she received a seed that was not adam's
[2:15:15] twins were born to her
[2:15:19] one of a righteous seed
[2:15:22] one of another seed
[2:15:26] the new testament talks about cain who
[2:15:28] was of that evil one
[2:15:30] we know how it happened
[2:15:33] from that moment on they were both
[2:15:35] forced to deal with the knowledge
[2:15:39] that for everything good
[2:15:41] there is a counterfeited evil
[2:15:46] and they started mankind not only
[2:15:48] themselves but they started mankind on a
[2:15:51] journey that you and i are still walking
[2:15:53] on today
[2:15:55] forced to choose every day of our lives
[2:15:58] as anybody here
[2:15:59] even the righteous redeemed of the lord
[2:16:02] we are forced every day of our life to
[2:16:05] make the decision
[2:16:08] to follow the god and the knowledge of
[2:16:11] good or to follow the knowledge of evil
[2:16:16] no one's looking
[2:16:18] i could just cheat
[2:16:20] no one would really know
[2:16:22] i could just lie and no one would ever
[2:16:24] figure it out
[2:16:26] i could just do such and such and such
[2:16:28] and mankind is still on that journey
[2:16:31] you know that wasn't the saddest part
[2:16:32] really of all that happened that day
[2:16:35] there was something more more more sad
[2:16:37] than that and that is the fact that that
[2:16:39] adam held in the beginning
[2:16:41] the title deed of heaven and earth
[2:16:44] and in that title deed of heaven and
[2:16:46] earth the plan of redemption was written
[2:16:50] think about it
[2:16:51] and adam held it in his own arms
[2:16:55] and when this took place the bible tells
[2:16:57] us that adam was not deceived
[2:17:01] new testament
[2:17:03] eve was deceived
[2:17:06] but adam knew exactly what he was doing
[2:17:08] she gave to him and he did it also
[2:17:12] why because he was fulfilling a
[2:17:14] prophetic story that you and i would one
[2:17:17] day become a part of
[2:17:19] he took his wife's sin
[2:17:22] he placed himself in that sin
[2:17:28] he was marred and changed by her
[2:17:31] unbelief
[2:17:33] forever his destiny
[2:17:35] would be adjusted from what he had
[2:17:36] expected
[2:17:38] but he did it to cover her
[2:17:41] he did it so that she could find a place
[2:17:44] again hiding in him
[2:17:47] she came from adam
[2:17:49] and now by this glorious redemptive act
[2:17:52] she could hide in adam again
[2:17:54] god was going to take care of both of
[2:17:56] them isn't that the goodness of god
[2:17:59] and so they go on you know you know i
[2:18:01] didn't even mean this morning when i was
[2:18:03] looking i didn't mean to go into this
[2:18:05] there's there's much more
[2:18:07] to go into but i guess we maybe needed
[2:18:09] to for some reason and they get down and
[2:18:12] all of a sudden
[2:18:15] it's looking about time in the garden
[2:18:18] for for papa to come
[2:18:22] the light's gone now that covered them
[2:18:25] both
[2:18:27] they've seen things about each other
[2:18:29] that they didn't realize
[2:18:31] that they didn't know about before
[2:18:34] and the first thing they do when they
[2:18:36] find out and you listen carefully
[2:18:38] the first thing they do when they find
[2:18:40] out it's about time for papa to come
[2:18:42] again they see their own nakedness
[2:18:45] they're now very much aware of their own
[2:18:48] freckles
[2:18:51] they know everything about their bodies
[2:18:54] and for some reason because of what took
[2:18:57] place
[2:18:59] the world will tell you they ate an
[2:19:01] apple
[2:19:03] if that were the truth and why didn't
[2:19:05] they put on masks
[2:19:07] like you and i did for two years and
[2:19:09] walk around
[2:19:12] when papa came down they didn't cover
[2:19:14] their mouths
[2:19:17] they covered their sexual organs
[2:19:21] with little aprons
[2:19:23] made from fig leaves that's what the
[2:19:25] bible tells us
[2:19:28] because this was where the shame came
[2:19:32] amen this is how the seed entered and
[2:19:34] this is how the shame came
[2:19:37] so they made it can you imagine trying
[2:19:39] to hide from papa
[2:19:42] with little fig aprons
[2:19:45] wrapped around their bodies like bikinis
[2:19:52] any good virtuous woman knows better
[2:19:57] than to expose her nakedness like that
[2:20:00] i don't want to see your knees
[2:20:04] i sure don't want to see the rest of you
[2:20:08] anybody with me
[2:20:10] i don't want to see the back of your leg
[2:20:13] i want you to pin up your split or sew
[2:20:16] it up
[2:20:18] i want you to remember who you are
[2:20:20] when we go out here in this world we've
[2:20:22] got to remember who we are we're
[2:20:24] reflecting the light
[2:20:26] it's not our light
[2:20:28] jesus is the light
[2:20:30] he lives in me
[2:20:32] and so they started trying to hide
[2:20:35] they're hiding over there in the bushes
[2:20:37] can you imagine hiding in the bushes
[2:20:39] with the little little fig aprons on
[2:20:42] when when when when yesterday about the
[2:20:45] same time they ran out into the clearing
[2:20:48] oh papa we're so glad you've come
[2:20:53] and now they're over there hiding in the
[2:20:54] bushes with little little fig leaf
[2:20:56] aprons on and god comes calling out to
[2:20:59] adam
[2:21:02] adam where are you
[2:21:06] you've never missed an appointment
[2:21:08] before
[2:21:10] you've never missed our fellowship hour
[2:21:12] before where are you you think god
[2:21:14] didn't know where he was
[2:21:16] you think god didn't know what happened
[2:21:18] you know adam was hiding over there in
[2:21:20] the bush because he thought that god had
[2:21:22] come to kill him
[2:21:26] people are afraid because they feel like
[2:21:29] that god is out to kill them
[2:21:32] he's out to destroy them
[2:21:34] well the truth is
[2:21:37] both god and the devil want to kill you
[2:21:43] now won't that be a theological
[2:21:44] masterpiece
[2:21:47] just for different reasons
[2:21:49] god wants to kill your old man so the
[2:21:51] new man can live
[2:21:53] and satan wants to kill you because he
[2:21:55] wants to take you clean out of god's
[2:21:56] economy
[2:21:59] so either way you're a dead man
[2:22:03] you might as well just surrender and let
[2:22:04] god kill the very nature of the flesh
[2:22:07] the very nature of the serpents
[2:22:10] the very nature of the beast
[2:22:12] so that the nature of christ can live
[2:22:14] and rule and reign in you oh my god
[2:22:18] we're almost out of genesis 3.
[2:22:24] we haven't got the revelation yet where
[2:22:25] david was
[2:22:26] reading to us
[2:22:30] you just can't whisper those words david
[2:22:34] those words when i hear somebody read
[2:22:36] that like david did that last time i
[2:22:39] tell you it reverberates in all of who i
[2:22:42] am
[2:22:43] i'm here today i'm here today let me
[2:22:45] tell you something brother i'm here
[2:22:47] today because the lion prevailed
[2:22:50] i'm here today because the lion of the
[2:22:52] tribe of judah prevailed
[2:22:56] [Applause]
[2:22:59] you know what god did
[2:23:03] he wasn't there to kill him
[2:23:06] he was there to cover them
[2:23:09] he was there to put clothes on them
[2:23:14] give me the verse brother give me the
[2:23:15] verse somebody find me the verse i
[2:23:18] wasn't even going to read this
[2:23:20] give me the verse where he comes to
[2:23:22] clothe them
[2:23:23] and let me read it
[2:23:27] some people looked at me like they
[2:23:28] didn't remember
[2:23:30] give me 321
[2:23:32] pretty please
[2:23:36] it's just 119.
[2:23:38] we're good
[2:23:41] unto adam also and to his wife
[2:23:44] you know why i like to read this because
[2:23:46] there are people who study the bible
[2:23:47] their whole life and have never caught
[2:23:49] this verse
[2:23:50] i've had people tell me you i never i
[2:23:52] never knew that was in the bible
[2:23:54] i remember standing in my bookstore when
[2:23:56] i owned a little bookstore before i was
[2:23:58] married
[2:23:59] i remember standing there one day and
[2:24:00] talking to these baptist people about
[2:24:02] the fact that the scripture said adam
[2:24:04] was not deceived
[2:24:05] he was well aware of the transgression
[2:24:07] he knew exactly what was happened
[2:24:09] happening but but that evil deceived and
[2:24:11] they said well that must be in the old
[2:24:12] testament i said well i know it's right
[2:24:14] here in the new testament let me show
[2:24:16] you this woman said i've been an adult
[2:24:18] sunday school teacher for 40 years
[2:24:21] and i never even knew that verse was in
[2:24:22] the bible so maybe there'd be somebody
[2:24:24] watching this didn't know this verse is
[2:24:26] in the bible unto adam also and to his
[2:24:28] wife eve did the lord god make what
[2:24:32] coats of skins
[2:24:33] and clothed them
[2:24:35] you're still with me
[2:24:38] i don't know what it looked like brother
[2:24:40] i don't know exactly how it looked like
[2:24:41] i don't know if he pulled i pulled a
[2:24:43] sword machine out of his cloak
[2:24:48] all i know is he said he made them coats
[2:24:50] of skins
[2:24:53] but i know this if i know anything about
[2:24:55] skinning something
[2:24:58] it's going to be a bloody mess
[2:25:01] and it's going to cost something it's
[2:25:03] life
[2:25:06] can you imagine god eternal
[2:25:10] picking up some little woolly sheep
[2:25:14] and taking them in his own hands
[2:25:18] slaying them
[2:25:20] and ripping the skin off of their body
[2:25:24] blood everywhere
[2:25:26] and making adam and eve coats
[2:25:30] to cover their nakedness
[2:25:33] and they're just melting
[2:25:34] adam and eve are melting in the presence
[2:25:36] of papa once they realized that he
[2:25:38] didn't come to kill them he came to
[2:25:40] cover them they're just melting in it
[2:25:42] they can't hardly believe
[2:25:44] that he's not there to kill them but
[2:25:47] instead he's there to cover them that's
[2:25:49] the god i
[2:25:50] serve go tell the world that the god we
[2:25:54] serve wants to cover you
[2:25:56] [Applause]
[2:25:59] but he cannot do it without the shedding
[2:26:01] of blood
[2:26:03] blood has to be shed
[2:26:05] little animals had to give their lives
[2:26:08] i tell you i want to talk in tongues
[2:26:12] but i'm preaching in english
[2:26:19] i love to hear brother branham tell it
[2:26:20] he tells us so much better than i
[2:26:24] after this great family time has come
[2:26:27] to an end
[2:26:30] and papa says
[2:26:32] you have to leave
[2:26:36] you know you have to leave now right
[2:26:40] you can't live here anymore
[2:26:45] let me remind you what the scripture
[2:26:47] tells us the scripture tells us that
[2:26:49] that eden was not just a garden
[2:26:54] eden was a land
[2:26:57] eden was a region that god had created
[2:26:59] and we know we know we don't know the
[2:27:01] exact dimensions but we know a little
[2:27:04] bit about it because of the rivers that
[2:27:05] the bible tells us run through the land
[2:27:07] of eden
[2:27:09] and in the land of eden was a garden
[2:27:12] and adam and eve were living in the
[2:27:14] garden
[2:27:15] of eden
[2:27:17] they weren't banished from the land
[2:27:20] they were banished from the garden
[2:27:22] and the reason why there were
[2:27:24] if there were two trees in the garden
[2:27:27] of great spiritual significance one was
[2:27:29] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[2:27:30] evil one was the tree of life the tree
[2:27:33] of life was placed in the garden to
[2:27:34] represent jesus christ
[2:27:38] in a pre-adamic existence
[2:27:41] and adam and eve would have been able to
[2:27:43] make their way at any time to that tree
[2:27:45] of life and also eat of its fruit had
[2:27:48] they not been banished
[2:27:50] from the garden
[2:27:53] do you know if they would have done that
[2:27:55] our redemption would have been at stake
[2:28:00] they would have had eternal life
[2:28:02] you and you and i would have had no hope
[2:28:07] so god just scoots someone out
[2:28:10] i can't imagine what that would be like
[2:28:12] to feel the warm embrace and love of
[2:28:15] abba and then all of a sudden be told
[2:28:18] but you know you can't live at home
[2:28:20] don't you
[2:28:23] you've got to go live somewhere else
[2:28:27] brother branham tells it much better
[2:28:28] than i could he said i can see them
[2:28:30] there making their way out of the garden
[2:28:34] with bloody skins
[2:28:36] slapping the back of their legs
[2:28:40] as they go
[2:28:42] covering them
[2:28:45] but mankind would never be the same
[2:28:47] again
[2:28:50] adam would have never died
[2:28:53] eve would have lived forever
[2:28:56] but now death had been entered
[2:29:00] death had been brought into the equation
[2:29:02] all a part of god's economy
[2:29:05] but i can't help but think about what
[2:29:06] would have been what could have been
[2:29:10] the worst part of it all was adam who
[2:29:12] held dominion and authority over the
[2:29:14] earth including possession of the title
[2:29:17] deed
[2:29:19] he lost that in the fall
[2:29:21] and it went back into the hands of the
[2:29:23] original owner
[2:29:24] the original creator god
[2:29:27] is anybody with me
[2:29:29] sixth seal for me just a moment and i'm
[2:29:31] gonna i i'm gonna i'm gonna be done it
[2:29:34] too
[2:29:38] if you need to go out to the washroom
[2:29:39] you can do that quickly and come back
[2:29:41] with us
[2:29:43] this is my birthday sunday
[2:29:46] i would rather preach than have a
[2:29:48] present
[2:29:51] there's nothing i'd rather do on if i
[2:29:54] could have a day if a day was dedicated
[2:29:56] to me
[2:29:56] and they said do what you enjoy the most
[2:30:00] the best birthdays i've ever had in my
[2:30:02] life are the ones i spent preaching the
[2:30:04] gospel
[2:30:05] and there's been a bunch of them there
[2:30:07] have been 40 48
[2:30:09] i might not have preached on the day but
[2:30:10] on the weekend of or close to that there
[2:30:12] have been there have been about 48 of
[2:30:14] those
[2:30:16] and i'm looking forward to more until he
[2:30:18] comes
[2:30:19] 126 compare scriptures of this great
[2:30:22] event that we will see that this great
[2:30:25] secret or mystery that was under the
[2:30:27] sixth seal of the book of redemption now
[2:30:29] remember these are hidden mysteries stay
[2:30:31] with me
[2:30:32] and the sixth seal all together
[2:30:35] in one is one great big book just six
[2:30:38] scrolls rolled together this was the
[2:30:40] book that that david was talking about
[2:30:43] in the scripture this morning and the
[2:30:45] girls were singing about
[2:30:48] it's not a book it's not a codex
[2:30:50] but it's scrolls that were rolled
[2:30:52] together
[2:30:54] sealed with seven seals
[2:30:57] brother branham said just six scrolls
[2:30:59] rolled together and it unwinds the whole
[2:31:01] book of redemption that's how the all
[2:31:03] earth the whole earth
[2:31:05] was redeemed
[2:31:07] let me tell you this plan of redemption
[2:31:09] was not just for the lost soul of man it
[2:31:12] was for every part of god's creation
[2:31:15] including the earth that we walk on
[2:31:17] you don't have to worry your pretty head
[2:31:19] about global warming
[2:31:25] it's not your your suv that's causing
[2:31:28] any problem
[2:31:29] it's what sin is doing to the
[2:31:31] environment
[2:31:32] and right around the corner he's going
[2:31:34] to renovate it all anyway
[2:31:36] he'll redeem every bit of the earth as
[2:31:39] we know it have you ever thought about
[2:31:41] what it'll be like in that hour when the
[2:31:42] lion lays down next to the lamb and your
[2:31:45] little child plays on the hole of a
[2:31:46] poisonous snake and nobody grabs his
[2:31:49] hand
[2:31:51] the wolf
[2:31:53] is gentle
[2:31:56] nothing to be afraid of
[2:31:58] the whole earth and all creation is
[2:32:01] redeemed
[2:32:02] i'm glad i know i'm a part of that
[2:32:05] he goes on
[2:32:06] uh six scrolls roll together it unwinds
[2:32:08] the whole book of redemption that's how
[2:32:09] the whole earth was redeemed that's the
[2:32:11] reason john wept
[2:32:13] you heard it this morning because if no
[2:32:16] one could get that book all creation
[2:32:18] everything was gone she would just
[2:32:20] simply turn back to atoms and molecules
[2:32:22] and so forth and cosmic light and not
[2:32:25] even be creation per person nothing else
[2:32:28] nothing not a person left nothing else
[2:32:31] because adam lost the rights of that
[2:32:34] book
[2:32:35] he forfeited
[2:32:37] when he listened to his wife and she
[2:32:39] listened to satan's reasonings instead
[2:32:41] of the word of god see it was forfeited
[2:32:44] brother sister always pays to listen to
[2:32:46] the word of god if you believe that same
[2:32:48] man
[2:32:48] now let's go to the breach between the
[2:32:50] seals
[2:32:51] and the church ages paragraph 99 i'm
[2:32:54] hurrying but i want to read this
[2:32:56] now when adam sinned by heeding his
[2:32:57] wife's reasoning instead of holding
[2:32:59] listen we're not here to blame eve
[2:33:02] i i don't have any animosity to towards
[2:33:05] she did exactly what she was created to
[2:33:07] do
[2:33:12] she had to do such a thing as that just
[2:33:13] like judas had to do what judas did
[2:33:16] what would have happened if the lord
[2:33:17] hadn't been betrayed
[2:33:19] would happen if eve hadn't listened to
[2:33:21] the enemy like she did
[2:33:23] oh eve he i mean adam he was tempted to
[2:33:25] throw her completely under the bus
[2:33:26] wasn't he
[2:33:28] first thing he started stammering when
[2:33:29] god started asking questions it's that
[2:33:31] woman you give me
[2:33:34] oh husbands
[2:33:38] let me see if i can find me some
[2:33:40] oh husbands don't you do that
[2:33:44] don't you do that don't you throw that
[2:33:45] woman under the bus
[2:33:47] don't you blame her for your problem
[2:33:51] amen
[2:33:54] someone recently said they were afraid
[2:33:56] of me because i was angry i was
[2:33:59] i don't get that way often
[2:34:01] but i was angry but there was no need to
[2:34:03] be afraid of me
[2:34:04] i've never caused anybody physical harm
[2:34:06] that i know of
[2:34:08] except
[2:34:14] except benjamin joshua leaving mariah
[2:34:21] they weren't crippled
[2:34:25] they weren't they weren't really bruised
[2:34:27] the worst thing i ever did was by
[2:34:29] mistake
[2:34:31] i i took joshua one time he was so
[2:34:34] aggravating
[2:34:35] i know you find that hard to believe
[2:34:38] ha ha
[2:34:40] and and i don't know i was we were out
[2:34:42] and somewhere and i just i just grabbed
[2:34:44] a little bit of hair like that and i
[2:34:45] just pulled that's all i it really
[2:34:46] wasn't even violent i didn't
[2:34:48] i just did that just for him to have a
[2:34:50] little feeling which for me it kind of
[2:34:52] feels good
[2:34:56] he jerked
[2:35:01] i tried to figure out how to put it back
[2:35:05] i sure was embarrassed at what i had
[2:35:07] done it was not not in vicious man
[2:35:11] i'm not a violent person like that
[2:35:15] but there are certain things that can
[2:35:17] push you
[2:35:22] i i want you to be very careful
[2:35:26] how you blame
[2:35:30] that woman you gave me
[2:35:34] someone recently said
[2:35:37] to me
[2:35:39] through email
[2:35:43] i'm struggling with pornography
[2:35:46] that doesn't shock me it doesn't it
[2:35:48] doesn't upset me it doesn't make me
[2:35:50] angry i understand that it's a struggle
[2:35:52] of this age
[2:35:55] i feel sorry for people who are so naive
[2:35:57] to think that only men are caught up in
[2:35:59] that
[2:36:02] but maybe mostly men but it's not all
[2:36:04] men
[2:36:06] the reason for that is because uh that
[2:36:09] is how a man is stimulated is through
[2:36:11] his eyes
[2:36:13] and the enemy sure does take advantage
[2:36:16] of that so i just got ready in my mind
[2:36:18] to start ministering what i would
[2:36:20] minister to someone so i'm already ready
[2:36:22] to type
[2:36:24] to minister to this brother to see if i
[2:36:26] could help him to come out from under
[2:36:29] condemnation and get help because the
[2:36:31] lord is there to set him free from that
[2:36:32] it's an addiction and it will destroy
[2:36:34] your life
[2:36:37] and all of a sudden i read the last line
[2:36:42] and i wanted to slug him
[2:36:47] that's why i said i'm not normally a
[2:36:48] violent person i wanted to slug him
[2:36:52] he was doing so well
[2:36:54] he was confessing his wrong and
[2:36:57] explaining how the enemy had had brought
[2:36:59] such a bondage and such an addiction and
[2:37:02] then the last line he blamed his wife
[2:37:10] brother i'm done i'm done at that point
[2:37:14] i didn't give him the standard
[2:37:16] answers and lead him down the road i
[2:37:19] generally lead people down that way the
[2:37:21] first thing i said to him was you can't
[2:37:24] even be delivered
[2:37:27] until you realize
[2:37:29] that no one is responsible for your sin
[2:37:33] but you
[2:37:37] you've got to own that
[2:37:40] now i know what brother branham said he
[2:37:42] said a woman ought to cover up she
[2:37:43] should
[2:37:45] a man ought to be
[2:37:46] wear big enough genes too
[2:37:49] we ought to be modest in the way that we
[2:37:51] present ourselves
[2:37:52] i know that brother branham said and the
[2:37:55] scripture teaches that modesty is right
[2:37:57] and that a woman shouldn't show her
[2:37:58] underneath garment shouldn't be
[2:38:01] out there for a man to imagine and so
[2:38:03] forth and etc i don't believe that's
[2:38:05] right brother branham said when you
[2:38:06] dress like that you potentially have
[2:38:08] already committed a sex act
[2:38:11] so i believe we ought to be careful
[2:38:13] about that but i'm not going to sit
[2:38:14] around and let anybody male or female
[2:38:17] blame somebody else
[2:38:20] for their sin
[2:38:22] i said brother nobody's making you go
[2:38:24] back nobody's causing you to look for
[2:38:26] that no one is doing that except you're
[2:38:29] yielding to the lie
[2:38:35] well this was about a month ago and for
[2:38:37] three weeks i didn't hear a thing back
[2:38:38] from that brother not one word
[2:38:41] and i said i don't care if i don't ever
[2:38:43] hear from him again if i can't tell him
[2:38:45] the truth
[2:38:47] this past monday i opened up my email he
[2:38:50] sent me an email and he said i've been
[2:38:51] so mad at you for three weeks i've
[2:38:53] almost cussed
[2:38:56] that's mad
[2:38:58] he said and then all of a sudden i was
[2:39:01] listening to a sermon and in that sermon
[2:39:04] i realized that what you were telling me
[2:39:07] was
[2:39:08] right and i'm ready to repent and i'm
[2:39:13] ready to own my sin
[2:39:16] so that jesus can set me free
[2:39:18] and you know what i believe god has done
[2:39:20] that i believe god's done that for that
[2:39:22] brother
[2:39:23] so so adam he started trying to it's
[2:39:25] that woman you give me you know she's a
[2:39:27] problem
[2:39:29] but i don't hold that against adam
[2:39:30] either
[2:39:31] because when it came time
[2:39:34] to do the right thing he had done the
[2:39:36] right thing so out of the garden they go
[2:39:39] no longer holding in their hand
[2:39:41] this great title deed of redemption
[2:39:44] for the earth
[2:39:46] let's read the next did we finish the
[2:39:48] quote we were on
[2:39:50] now when adam sinned by heeding his
[2:39:52] wife's reasoning instead of holding
[2:39:54] god's word that's what made adam sin
[2:39:57] his wife reasoned with satan and then
[2:39:59] produced the product to adam
[2:40:02] and adam turn loose the word
[2:40:04] and sold out that's an important thing
[2:40:06] right there
[2:40:07] and that's what i said to that brother i
[2:40:09] said you could not embrace that sin
[2:40:12] unless you first turned loose of god's
[2:40:15] word
[2:40:17] you got a rock anybody listening to me
[2:40:19] you got a rock folks you can't operate
[2:40:22] in unbelief unless you first turn loose
[2:40:24] to the word
[2:40:25] if you take your hands off of god's word
[2:40:27] then you are a prey
[2:40:30] you're free pray to the enemy and he'll
[2:40:32] take full advantage of you you hold on
[2:40:35] to the rock
[2:40:36] his wife reasoned with satan and then
[2:40:38] produced the product to adam
[2:40:40] and adam turn loose the word and sold
[2:40:42] out
[2:40:44] that's never a good thing to do
[2:40:47] he lost also his inheritance
[2:40:50] when he lost his fellowship
[2:40:52] and right to life
[2:40:56] i want you to understand this too
[2:40:58] his fellowship was was broken
[2:41:01] but his relationship was unchanged
[2:41:05] you better hear me
[2:41:07] he was still a son
[2:41:09] he was still a son
[2:41:11] now if you're a son you'll never thrive
[2:41:14] without that fellowship
[2:41:17] you asked tiffany
[2:41:19] i saw her hand up in the air you asked
[2:41:21] her
[2:41:22] she was always one of gods
[2:41:24] but when you lose that place of
[2:41:26] fellowship with him you feel as far away
[2:41:28] from god as anybody possibly could and
[2:41:31] far away from his people
[2:41:33] but god just proves to us if you're
[2:41:35] willing to do the right thing
[2:41:37] then all you have to do is come back to
[2:41:39] him and say god i really messed up
[2:41:43] don't forget to tell him i may really
[2:41:45] mess up again
[2:41:49] but i'm throwing myself on your mercy
[2:41:55] and papa says i've missed our times
[2:41:57] together
[2:42:00] i feel led to tell this and i'm going to
[2:42:02] close
[2:42:06] i might read it
[2:42:15] give me just a minute
[2:42:17] is this the only church you've ever been
[2:42:18] to where the preacher just leaves
[2:42:21] it comes back
[2:42:23] i'm not going to the washroom
[2:42:33] i might not order going back there
[2:42:34] because
[2:42:38] somebody's got a crock-pot in the
[2:42:39] musician's room
[2:42:42] and i smelt lunch
[2:42:45] if i'd have gone back there about 30
[2:42:46] minutes ago we might be done by now
[2:42:52] i'm not i've not lived long enough but
[2:42:55] it's my birthday week
[2:42:57] i've not lived long enough to be quoted
[2:43:02] so i have to quote myself
[2:43:07] david was talking to me one night this
[2:43:09] week and he said have you heard your
[2:43:10] sermon such and such
[2:43:13] i said no david i haven't
[2:43:17] i know i should but i haven't
[2:43:21] it's good somebody's listening
[2:43:26] i'm going to read this to you it's an
[2:43:28] experience that i had with the lord it
[2:43:30] was visionary in incense
[2:43:32] that i was wide awake
[2:43:36] it's called fellowship with me
[2:43:38] i remember a time in
[2:43:40] when i was serving as pastor to a church
[2:43:43] in south carolina i was 19 years old at
[2:43:45] the time
[2:43:46] living alone in a small rented brick
[2:43:48] house so i'm
[2:43:50] 54 this
[2:43:52] this week
[2:43:53] i was living alone in a small rented
[2:43:55] brick house i had made a commitment to
[2:43:57] meet the lord bright and early every
[2:43:59] morning
[2:44:00] beside the sofa in my small living room
[2:44:03] it was there that i learned the joy of
[2:44:05] daily communion with him
[2:44:07] i would use this time to pray and pour
[2:44:09] out my heart to the lord and then i
[2:44:11] would worship and wait
[2:44:13] it was during the waiting that he would
[2:44:15] speak to me isn't it always that way
[2:44:18] sometimes with encouragement and
[2:44:19] sometimes instruction let me just put a
[2:44:21] put
[2:44:23] my finger there just a moment and tell
[2:44:24] you that
[2:44:27] the the celebration that we had this
[2:44:29] morning
[2:44:31] and that we often have when we're here
[2:44:33] it it'll never take the place
[2:44:36] it will never take the place
[2:44:39] of being alone
[2:44:42] with him
[2:44:43] it is not a substitute
[2:44:46] it's another
[2:44:48] part
[2:44:50] of being with him
[2:44:52] oh how his presence come this morning
[2:44:56] i knew he was here but i didn't know i i
[2:44:58] wasn't i wasn't
[2:45:00] feeling you know it's not about a
[2:45:02] feeling but you you do you do feel you
[2:45:05] do experience i wasn't experiencing that
[2:45:07] presence to that degree until i stepped
[2:45:10] here where benjamin had been singing and
[2:45:11] then all of a sudden i've
[2:45:17] but there's nothing
[2:45:19] to take the place of those times when
[2:45:21] it's just you and papa
[2:45:24] you just worship
[2:45:26] you just tell him how wonderful he is i
[2:45:28] know you men
[2:45:30] that won't ever brag on your wives
[2:45:33] i know you must have a hard time
[2:45:35] bragging on him
[2:45:37] but i say the awful things that that
[2:45:39] some people say they could never say
[2:45:41] somebody said they could never say it
[2:45:43] but i often tell him oh jesus you are so
[2:45:46] beautiful
[2:45:49] everything about you is beautiful to me
[2:45:54] sister joyce just quoted you are all
[2:45:56] together lovely
[2:45:58] there are no eyes like your eyes
[2:46:02] there's no face like his face
[2:46:07] when we stand in the presence of the
[2:46:09] lord and we get in that moment it may
[2:46:11] not be that we see a physical image
[2:46:14] standing before us but
[2:46:16] his presence becomes so real we can see
[2:46:18] him
[2:46:19] we can see him
[2:46:21] i'm asked all the time do you have you
[2:46:23] ever seen the lord i've seen the lord
[2:46:25] yes i'm not ashamed to tell you i've
[2:46:27] seen the lord in worship
[2:46:29] i've seen him in prayer time
[2:46:32] and i saw him
[2:46:34] when he came to visit me at the age of
[2:46:36] three years old yes i've seen the lord
[2:46:39] but those moments when i may not be able
[2:46:41] to say i physically see him but his
[2:46:43] presence is so real that i can see and
[2:46:45] perceive that it's those are the most
[2:46:47] precious times don't you think
[2:46:50] that you're going to be able to survive
[2:46:53] only on what you experience here
[2:46:55] corporately
[2:46:57] are you listening you're going to have
[2:46:58] to have that time with your head and if
[2:47:00] you're like i said if you're a man
[2:47:02] that's got an identity crisis you're
[2:47:04] going to have a hard time with this
[2:47:05] place of intimacy because you're going
[2:47:07] to have to find your yourself
[2:47:09] spiritually with your head on his chest
[2:47:13] because you're part of a bride and a
[2:47:15] bride must hear the heartbeat of god
[2:47:17] we don't just hear what comes out of his
[2:47:19] mouth we want to know what makes his
[2:47:20] heart beat
[2:47:22] and in order to do that we have to pull
[2:47:23] up as close to him as we possibly can
[2:47:26] and when i say that my heart yearns
[2:47:28] because i know there are millions of
[2:47:30] people out there that if they could only
[2:47:33] know
[2:47:35] if they could only know that such an
[2:47:36] experience was possible
[2:47:40] it would change so many things about
[2:47:42] their life even christians
[2:47:45] if they could only understand that he
[2:47:48] longs to have fellowship with you
[2:47:50] are you still with me
[2:47:53] and then i would worship and wait it was
[2:47:55] during the waiting that he would speak
[2:47:56] to me sometimes with encouragement and
[2:47:58] sometimes instruction
[2:48:00] during this time in my life i often felt
[2:48:03] alone
[2:48:04] it was my first time living away from
[2:48:06] family and i was pioneering a church in
[2:48:08] a very difficult city
[2:48:09] i needed those times of soaking and holy
[2:48:12] downloads
[2:48:13] it became the most important part of my
[2:48:15] day
[2:48:16] one morning i was rushing out the door i
[2:48:19] had a daily radio broadcast from a local
[2:48:22] studio
[2:48:23] normally there was plenty of time to
[2:48:24] spend with the lord before i had to be
[2:48:26] at the station but this morning was
[2:48:28] different
[2:48:29] i had to leave early to prepare for an
[2:48:31] interview that i was going to give on
[2:48:33] the same station later that day
[2:48:35] the owner of the station had heard me
[2:48:37] share a vision on my daily program and
[2:48:40] had asked me to come and do an interview
[2:48:42] about it and just for you that know the
[2:48:46] visions that was the
[2:48:48] that was the uh bridal army in fatigues
[2:48:52] and the owner of that station was so
[2:48:54] fascinated by that he was not a believer
[2:48:57] but he was so fascinated in that he said
[2:48:59] i want you to come and let the dj
[2:49:01] interview you for a couple hours and i
[2:49:02] want you to tell about that again he
[2:49:04] said that was if you all will remember
[2:49:06] correctly that was also part of the same
[2:49:08] vision where
[2:49:10] where i saw the preacher in the great uh
[2:49:13] in the great stadium that had been
[2:49:15] turned into a church
[2:49:17] and he was preaching a uh
[2:49:20] a different jesus
[2:49:22] it was years later before i saw that man
[2:49:24] face to face on a television screen and
[2:49:27] realized that i had seen him in a vision
[2:49:29] many many many years before he had
[2:49:31] stepped into that role but anyway
[2:49:34] so i had to leave early to prepare for
[2:49:35] an interview later that day the owner of
[2:49:37] the station had heard i was excited
[2:49:39] about this two hour long opportunity to
[2:49:41] share spiritual things
[2:49:43] and because of this commitment
[2:49:45] i skipped my regular devotion time
[2:49:47] beside the sofa i remember being in the
[2:49:49] shower that morning and saying lord i'll
[2:49:51] meet you when i come home today i i
[2:49:53] won't let this day go by i'll meet you
[2:49:55] when i come home today
[2:49:57] now i had to leave early
[2:49:59] i start listen excuse me
[2:50:01] uh i'd skip my regular devotion time
[2:50:03] beside the sofa
[2:50:05] let me just tell you 11 points
[2:50:08] print used to be good enough
[2:50:12] now i need 13.
[2:50:14] though this has to be reprinted
[2:50:16] i started toward the door when suddenly
[2:50:18] my briefcase opened
[2:50:21] spilling all of its contents onto the
[2:50:23] floor
[2:50:24] in exasperation i stooped down
[2:50:26] collecting all my papers and putting
[2:50:28] them safely back inside i remember
[2:50:30] thinking how odd that seemed
[2:50:33] i knew the case was latched and it had
[2:50:36] never popped open like that before
[2:50:39] i continued my quest to get out the door
[2:50:41] when the whole scene repeated i even
[2:50:43] heard the latch on the briefcase pop
[2:50:46] open
[2:50:47] as everything came pouring out
[2:50:49] after once again shoving all my things
[2:50:51] into the case i closed the latch and
[2:50:54] scrambled the digits of the combination
[2:50:56] lock
[2:50:57] i still felt like something was amiss
[2:50:59] but could not discern what it was
[2:51:01] i walked back through the house checking
[2:51:03] to make sure everything was in order
[2:51:05] stove was turned off no faucet was
[2:51:07] running et cetera
[2:51:09] grabbing my case for the third time i
[2:51:11] closed the door behind me
[2:51:13] taking time to lock the deadbolt of the
[2:51:15] house
[2:51:16] i felt sense of accomplishment that i'd
[2:51:18] finally made it to the front porch i
[2:51:20] started down the steps and it happened
[2:51:22] again
[2:51:24] first the sound of the latch popping
[2:51:25] open
[2:51:26] and then every single sheet of paper
[2:51:28] every pen all the content scattered onto
[2:51:30] the steps of my little porch i cried out
[2:51:33] in total frustration and for the third
[2:51:35] third time crammed everything back into
[2:51:37] the case
[2:51:39] it finally dawned on me i'm a slow
[2:51:41] learner sometime
[2:51:43] it finally dawned on me that the lord
[2:51:45] must be trying to speak to me
[2:51:47] i walked back up the steps and over to
[2:51:49] the door unlocking it and slowly
[2:51:51] stepping back inside my little living
[2:51:53] room
[2:51:53] there he was
[2:51:58] waiting for me
[2:52:00] i saw him
[2:52:02] a heavenly being of exquisite brightness
[2:52:05] only the shape of his body was visible
[2:52:07] as he knelt there in my spot
[2:52:11] i had sensed his presence many times
[2:52:13] kneeling there beside me but i had never
[2:52:15] seen him before i wept
[2:52:18] throwing my case onto the chair i
[2:52:20] collapsed beside him
[2:52:22] i wanted to express my shame but words
[2:52:25] would not come
[2:52:26] i wanted to plead my case and tell him
[2:52:29] how sorry i was for neglecting my
[2:52:31] special time with him but i was so
[2:52:33] grieved
[2:52:34] all i could do was sob
[2:52:37] speechless
[2:52:40] he shifted closer to me
[2:52:43] and i was overshadowed by tender
[2:52:45] compassionate peace
[2:52:48] than he spoke
[2:52:51] you thought this time was only for you
[2:52:55] but it was also for me
[2:53:00] i have enjoyed my time of fellowship
[2:53:02] with you each
[2:53:04] and every morning
[2:53:06] i was undone
[2:53:08] changed forever
[2:53:11] he
[2:53:12] wanted
[2:53:13] to have fellowship
[2:53:15] with me
[2:53:17] the one who knew me best
[2:53:20] yet loved me most
[2:53:22] with all my weaknesses he desired
[2:53:25] my fellowship
[2:53:27] i was overwhelmed
[2:53:29] the lover of our souls longs to have
[2:53:32] quiet intimate fellowship with us
[2:53:35] we must not disappoint him can you say
[2:53:38] amen
[2:53:40] let's stand and let the musicians come
[2:53:45] oh
[2:53:46] to realize
[2:53:53] he didn't come to destroy them
[2:53:56] he come to make clothes for them
[2:54:00] he came to cover their shame
[2:54:03] in their nakedness
[2:54:09] it was expedient that they leave the
[2:54:11] garden
[2:54:15] he made sure that they didn't sneak back
[2:54:20] he placed
[2:54:22] cherubim
[2:54:25] angels with flaming swords of fire
[2:54:29] that turned in every direction like the
[2:54:31] wheel within the wheel
[2:54:37] to guard the way
[2:54:40] they weren't keeping them out of the
[2:54:42] garden
[2:54:44] they were keeping them away from the
[2:54:45] tree of life
[2:54:47] powerful isn't it
[2:54:50] and now we're living in this hour
[2:54:53] and god has once again sent a flaming
[2:54:55] sword
[2:54:57] the flaming sword that once was there to
[2:55:00] keep us away from the tree of life
[2:55:02] it's now pointed in our direction
[2:55:07] to invite us back
[2:55:10] to show us the way
[2:55:12] to the way
[2:55:13] think of it
[2:55:15] and now instead of a thought keep out
[2:55:18] keep out keep out there's a call that
[2:55:21] says
[2:55:24] come up higher
[2:55:27] revelation 4 1 come up higher
[2:55:30] i want to show you something
[2:55:34] that old veil
[2:55:36] that once was there to keep man out
[2:55:42] it was so strong and so powerful that
[2:55:45] they say
[2:55:47] woven so intricately
[2:55:50] that they say if you could have if you
[2:55:53] should have hooked up a yoke of oxen
[2:55:57] in one direction and in another that
[2:55:59] that those yoke of oxen would not have
[2:56:01] been able to pull that veil apart
[2:56:06] and yet the bible says there he lay on
[2:56:08] that cross hanging on that cross dying
[2:56:11] brother branham said the priest could
[2:56:13] look out the window of the temple and
[2:56:15] see him there
[2:56:20] hanging the sacrifice for all mankind
[2:56:23] and there they were busy about their
[2:56:24] religiousness
[2:56:26] doing what they'd always done not even
[2:56:28] recognizing that hanging out there on
[2:56:30] the other side of that glass
[2:56:32] was the very son of god becoming a
[2:56:33] living sacrifice for all mankind
[2:56:36] but you see listen
[2:56:38] they had a different reason
[2:56:41] for making sure that veil stood in its
[2:56:43] place
[2:56:45] because they knew something that the
[2:56:46] rest of the people didn't know
[2:56:48] the ark was gone
[2:56:54] the ark was no longer there
[2:56:57] and they're the only ones the priesthood
[2:56:59] had passed it down a couple generations
[2:57:01] there they're the only ones who knew
[2:57:03] there was no no no ark there it had been
[2:57:06] hidden away
[2:57:10] you remember it had been captured
[2:57:13] some believed it was taken to ethiopia
[2:57:17] some believed it was taken to other
[2:57:18] places and some believe that to this day
[2:57:21] it's hidden
[2:57:22] underneath the temple mount
[2:57:25] i've met with men who believed great
[2:57:27] archaeologists and scientists who
[2:57:29] believe both have believed both theories
[2:57:33] what many people don't realize is that
[2:57:36] the sages tell us that a duplicate was
[2:57:38] made
[2:57:41] and the ark of the covenant that was
[2:57:42] stolen away was most likely the decoy
[2:57:46] and that the reality is that piece of
[2:57:48] furniture probably still exists
[2:57:50] and is hidden beneath somewhere beneath
[2:57:52] the temple mount
[2:57:54] if that were true that would explain
[2:57:56] some of the contention
[2:57:58] of what goes on over on that little
[2:57:59] piece of property even this week
[2:58:02] it explains the fact that men lost their
[2:58:04] lives when the temple tunnels were
[2:58:06] opened up again and brother greeley and
[2:58:08] several of us i know others here have
[2:58:10] been with me and we've walked through
[2:58:11] those temple tunnels
[2:58:13] we've gone as close to the place where
[2:58:14] the ark of the covenant sat in solomon's
[2:58:17] temple as possible
[2:58:19] but those precious people of second
[2:58:21] temple period
[2:58:22] they had no idea that the ark of the
[2:58:24] covenant was no longer there
[2:58:27] and if they allowed
[2:58:28] if they allowed people to see behind
[2:58:30] that veil then worshipers would have
[2:58:32] been discouraged and dissuaded
[2:58:35] and so they kept that veil in place and
[2:58:38] they kept it a secret from mankind
[2:58:41] and when jesus came to die he came to
[2:58:44] open up the way so that all mankind
[2:58:47] could come behind the veil
[2:58:50] and he also ripped that veil from top to
[2:58:52] bottom to expose the hypocrisy of
[2:58:56] religion
[2:58:58] to expose their lives
[2:59:01] and to say it's not about a box anymore
[2:59:04] it's about the one hanging out there
[2:59:07] without the camp
[2:59:09] suffering and giving his life
[2:59:12] and brother branham told us that after
[2:59:14] that veil was rent and twain from top to
[2:59:16] bottom that they took needle and thread
[2:59:22] sewed it back up to protect their lives
[2:59:26] and to keep mankind out
[2:59:30] but there's a bride
[2:59:34] hallelujah
[2:59:36] she'll not be kept out by man-made
[2:59:38] dogmas creeds or traditions
[2:59:42] she's heard the call of revelation 4-1
[2:59:44] come up higher i want to show you some
[2:59:47] things
[2:59:49] and she's heard the invitation that says
[2:59:51] let us therefore come
[2:59:55] [Music]
[2:59:58] to the throne of grace
[3:00:00] to find help in the time of need one
[3:00:02] more little quotation that i love and i
[3:00:04] quote it so much while they're getting
[3:00:06] ready to give us a worship number
[3:00:09] i love this one so much brother branham
[3:00:11] says we need to come in
[3:00:13] to that place to the holiest of holies
[3:00:17] and we need to stay there until the veil
[3:00:19] falls behind us
[3:00:22] does that sound like a flaming sword
[3:00:24] trying to keep you out
[3:00:27] no it doesn't sound like that at all to
[3:00:28] me it sounds like an invitation that
[3:00:30] says i want you i want to have
[3:00:32] fellowship with you i want you to come
[3:00:34] in behind the veil and get to know who i
[3:00:37] really am that's what it sounds like to
[3:00:38] me
[3:00:39] brother adam said you need to stay there
[3:00:41] till that veil falls behind you shutting
[3:00:43] you in
[3:00:45] to the glories of god and shutting out
[3:00:50] this whole world
[3:00:54] all that it offers us
[3:00:58] come on
[3:01:00] i want to worship him before we have
[3:01:01] lunch
[3:01:03] i want to worship him
