[0:00] [Music]
[0:20] you
[0:21] [Music]
[0:37] you
[0:38] [Music]
[0:50] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[0:53] Shelley and you're watching the Eagles
[0:55] cry I want to welcome you to the program
[0:57] today and we are in the middle of a
[1:00] series of programs on the process of
[1:03] spiritual adoption this would be
[1:05] installment number five and five is
[1:07] grace so maybe the Lord will help us to
[1:10] accomplish something in the reading of
[1:12] the scripture in the teaching today we
[1:14] would certainly like to see you get a
[1:16] deeper understanding of what it means to
[1:19] be an adopted son of God the authority
[1:23] that comes with the privilege and of
[1:24] course with all privileges there are
[1:27] also responsibilities and we have to
[1:29] always examine what kind of people we
[1:32] are and are we willing to live by the
[1:34] Word of God I want to just encourage you
[1:37] and testify to you today that no price
[1:40] is too great to pay to serve the Living
[1:44] God no sacrifice is too big and I
[1:47] realize that some of you in other parts
[1:49] of the world have a bigger sacrifice to
[1:52] make perhaps it's even dangerous for you
[1:55] to really share your faith publicly and
[1:59] I want you to know that we don't take
[2:01] that lightly we pray for you that God
[2:04] will sustain you that he will strengthen
[2:06] you that he will protect you that he
[2:09] will fill you with His Holy Spirit and
[2:11] that he will lead you and direct your
[2:14] footsteps and if you've got a prayer
[2:17] request that you'd like for us to
[2:18] specifically pray with you about maybe
[2:21] know your name and what your need is
[2:23] then we would just be happy to receive
[2:26] an email from you or a letter or a phone
[2:28] call all the contact information is
[2:31] given to you on the screen we want to be
[2:33] there for you the best way that we can
[2:35] we want to be faithful to join with you
[2:38] in prayer because our God is a prayer
[2:42] answering God and he is the same
[2:45] yesterday and today and forever and so
[2:48] we believe in the healing power of
[2:50] Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ we know
[2:53] that he's a healer we know that he's a
[2:54] deliverer we know that he's a savior so
[2:58] what ever you have need of give your
[3:00] knee to the Lord tell
[3:01] lay your petition before him and and
[3:05] believe with all of your heart we just
[3:08] understand that faith is the substance
[3:10] of things hoped for and the evidence of
[3:13] things not seen and I just asked the
[3:16] Lord today right now to anoint your
[3:18] faith to believe God for even the
[3:20] impossible what looks virtually
[3:23] impossible in your life I'm asking the
[3:26] Lord to strengthen your faith and
[3:28] anointed real good so that you can
[3:31] believe God in spite of what the
[3:33] circumstances look like let's look to
[3:35] the Word of God today we're going to the
[3:37] book of Galatians in Galatians chapter 4
[3:41] we've read in Romans 8 and we've read in
[3:45] Ephesians and now I want to read a few
[3:47] verses to you in Galatians concerning
[3:51] again adoption now what did we say that
[3:54] word adoption means it comes from two
[3:56] greek words and it basically means the
[3:59] placing of a mature son not a wine baby
[4:03] not a crybaby not a rebellious teenager
[4:08] but the placing of a mature son grant it
[4:14] Lord grant it that's my prayer that you
[4:17] would be able to place your mature sons
[4:20] in the body in this hour and there there
[4:22] may be some more deliverance needed in
[4:24] our life before we can come to that
[4:26] place of maturity but hey we've got God
[4:28] to help us we've got the Holy Spirit to
[4:31] guide us so if we can just keep
[4:33] accessing the promises of God by faith
[4:35] believing without wavering and and
[4:38] obeying the Lord just being obedient to
[4:41] him in all things and I know that he's
[4:43] going to manifest himself through his
[4:45] sons in a great and mighty way here in
[4:48] the end time Galatians chapter 4 verse 1
[4:52] is a very important portion of Scripture
[4:55] in this study it says now I say that the
[4:58] air as long as he is a child differ it
[5:02] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[5:06] of all notice that a natural born son of
[5:11] a citizen of Israel
[5:14] differed very little from the child of a
[5:18] hired servant though this young man
[5:21] would be the heir of all things yet
[5:25] while they were growing up there was not
[5:28] a lot of different shown to him but he
[5:31] is under tutors and governors until the
[5:35] time appointed of the father now that's
[5:39] exactly how it was in Bible days a
[5:42] father would appoint his son tutors and
[5:46] governors who would teach him and
[5:50] instruct him and train him and test him
[5:53] and cause him to to come to a place of
[5:57] discipline and authority and
[5:59] responsibility and when the father
[6:03] determined that this course of study was
[6:06] over then something began to take place
[6:09] and we're going to look at that in a few
[6:12] programs anyway maybe not get to it so
[6:14] much today but we are going to look at
[6:16] it very carefully verse 3 even so we now
[6:20] that's the natural but here's the
[6:22] spiritual even so we when we were
[6:25] children were in bondage under the
[6:28] elements of the world the influences of
[6:31] the world but when the fullness of time
[6:34] was come God sent forth his son Messiah
[6:39] Yeshua The Anointed One in the fullness
[6:44] of time to fulfill the scripture to
[6:47] fulfill the prophecies for hundreds of
[6:51] years the prophets had prophesied the
[6:53] coming of the Messiah the coming of the
[6:55] Messiah and in in and yet nothing
[6:59] anybody did could make it happen one
[7:01] moment earlier are our be late or have
[7:04] any flexibility in in time because it
[7:09] was not until God said the time has come
[7:12] you see it was not until the father said
[7:16] okay this boy has come to the age he has
[7:20] passed the test and so now we're going
[7:23] to celebrate him and that's the same way
[7:26] here it was not
[7:27] until the fullness of time was come that
[7:30] God sent forth his son made of a woman
[7:33] made under the law to redeem them that
[7:36] were under the law that we might receive
[7:39] the adoption of sons here we are again
[7:45] adoption the placing of a mature son now
[7:50] sometimes when you see that word son in
[7:53] the New Testament it refers to more or
[7:56] less a child or an infant but when you
[8:01] see the phrase the adoption of sons in
[8:04] fact when we read enrollments but as
[8:06] many as are led by the spirit they are
[8:08] the sons of God it's talking about a
[8:10] child a toddler a very almost very
[8:13] immature child but when you read further
[8:18] and it talks about the adoption of sons
[8:20] then that is the graduation that is the
[8:24] placing of a mature son to redeem them
[8:28] that were under the law that we might
[8:29] receive the adoption of sons and because
[8:33] your sons God had sent forth the spirit
[8:37] of his son into your hearts crying Abba
[8:42] Father there is my romans 8 of a father
[8:47] there it is again because your sons God
[8:52] had sent forth the spirit of his son
[8:55] Yeshua the Messiah Jesus into your
[8:58] hearts crying Abba Father now what does
[9:03] that mean it means the Spirit of God has
[9:05] come to you because you're a son to
[9:07] reveal to you that you have a very
[9:11] special invitation to have a very unique
[9:17] relationship with the Heavenly Father
[9:20] one that is based on love and grace and
[9:25] mercy and redemption so that you can be
[9:28] brought from a place of fear of bondage
[9:32] because bondage brings fear to a place
[9:36] of relationship where you can cry papa
[9:40] Abba
[9:41] father god that's what the fullness of
[9:44] adoption is going to do in our lives one
[9:46] of the many things it's going to help us
[9:49] come to a place where we realize what we
[9:51] have when we r sons of God and who we
[9:55] belong to as sons of God and that we are
[9:58] not to fear God in the sense that he's
[10:01] ready to destroy us if we fail but we're
[10:05] going to reverence him in reverential
[10:07] fear we're going to honor him because
[10:10] he's God but we're going to tell him
[10:12] what's in her heart we're going to lay
[10:13] our burdens before him we're going to
[10:15] come to him as he has asked us to do
[10:18] without fear without reluctance without
[10:21] dread do you know if you're angry you
[10:23] can tell god god I'm angry I'm really
[10:27] angry things have happened in my life
[10:29] that I feel are unfair and it's caused
[10:32] me to be angry and I need your help and
[10:35] if you've got this religious mindset of
[10:38] God and you come to God and say I'm
[10:40] angry well God just just knocks you down
[10:43] and and steps all over you but that's
[10:46] not the God of the Bible the God of the
[10:49] Bible picks you up and says I want to
[10:51] help you I want to help you with your
[10:53] fear I want to Minister strength to you
[10:56] and so it's so important for us to
[10:59] understand that this is the kind of
[11:01] relationship that God wants to have with
[11:04] his people because your son's God had
[11:08] sent forth the spirit of his son into
[11:11] your hearts crying Abba Father so really
[11:14] it's like his spirit crying out of our
[11:16] spirit of a father that's good wherefore
[11:20] thou art no more a servant but a son and
[11:25] if a son then an heir of God through
[11:30] Christ now that's pretty powerful now
[11:33] let's see how how far we wanted to go
[11:36] with that I think that's the last verse
[11:37] we were going to read wherefore thou art
[11:39] no more a servant but a son and if a son
[11:46] then an heir of God through Christ did
[11:50] you know even a natural-born son of a
[11:53] wealthy father
[11:54] was not automatically in line to inherit
[11:59] what the father had he had to go through
[12:02] the tutors he had to go through the
[12:04] governor's he had to be trained and
[12:06] taught how to handle himself how to
[12:10] behave how to treat other people fairly
[12:13] how to make righteous decisions how to
[12:16] invest all these things that would be if
[12:19] it was a maybe a farm family how to farm
[12:22] how to treat the servants how to treat
[12:25] one you know the the other business
[12:28] associates are those you bartered with
[12:30] the traded with there's there's so much
[12:32] that had to be trained and it was not
[12:35] until the Sun passed the test that he
[12:39] was celebrated and adopted and so even a
[12:44] natural born son had to come to that
[12:47] place of being publicly adopted and the
[12:52] purpose of that was to establish to the
[12:55] community that my son is now mature
[13:00] enough that I am depending on him and I
[13:05] want you to know that he is now
[13:08] authorized to conduct business in my
[13:11] name now if that's the natural side what
[13:15] about the spiritual side if if God is
[13:18] the scripture said you and I have been
[13:20] placed under tutors our great tutor is
[13:23] the Holy Spirit of God and we've been
[13:26] given tutors and governors in the
[13:28] natural spiritual leader spiritual
[13:30] father's spiritual mothers those who've
[13:34] loved us and prayed for us and
[13:35] instructed us and shared the truth with
[13:37] us watching for our souls trying to help
[13:41] us to come to a place where we can
[13:44] actually live out what we read in the
[13:46] Word of God and when we come to that
[13:48] place that we have passed the test and
[13:51] we have proven our love for the father
[13:54] and that we are determined to be what he
[13:57] has called us to be to walk in the
[13:59] fullness of our destiny then we come to
[14:02] that adoption ceremony where God
[14:04] celebrates us
[14:06] manifestation the apocalipsis the
[14:09] unveiling of the sons of God where he
[14:12] then says one last time to this wicked
[14:15] world these are my sons I'm pleased with
[14:20] them and I'm releasing authority in
[14:22] their hands and when that company of Sun
[14:25] steps forth there's going to be some
[14:30] unbelievable quick changes in the
[14:34] spiritual atmosphere of this world
[14:36] because there's going to be a full shift
[14:39] of authority from the throne to the
[14:40] earth and you're going to see the sons
[14:43] of God rise up and manifest the works of
[14:46] God for a quick short period of time
[14:48] that that I think we could say
[14:51] unprecedented the closest thing we have
[14:53] to understanding that would be the book
[14:55] of Acts where there was a whole
[14:57] community of believers that we're
[14:59] operating in the fullness of the Spirit
[15:01] of God but that does not even even that
[15:04] does it begin to really touch the
[15:06] surface or perhaps we could look back to
[15:09] the past generation during the great
[15:11] healing revivals and we could see the
[15:13] great men and women of God who were like
[15:16] prototypes for instance brother branham
[15:18] William Branham that God used so
[15:21] mightily in the 50s and 60s he was like
[15:26] a prototype of what a mature Son of God
[15:28] look like we're talking about a man who
[15:31] spoke on God's behalf and hey guess what
[15:34] God did what he spoke thousands upon
[15:37] thousands upon thousands of documented
[15:40] miracles where God manifested even the
[15:43] power of the creative spoken word we saw
[15:47] the unveiling of mystery truths and
[15:50] revelations come forth and and we're not
[15:53] saying that brother Branham was the only
[15:54] one but he was certainly used in a in a
[15:57] very profound and unique way there's no
[16:01] doubt about that in my mind but there
[16:04] were others who also came into a place
[16:07] of this adoption janji lake and and even
[16:11] mariah woodworth editor and God used AAA
[16:15] Allen and I know that we could stop and
[16:18] find thoughts or
[16:20] we could find weaknesses and all of
[16:22] God's servants so we can today but we
[16:26] have to realize if there were tokens in
[16:28] the past generation of men and women who
[16:31] superseded the rest of the church world
[16:33] who actually begin to carry on the
[16:36] Ministry of Jesus Christ in the earth in
[16:38] a way that it hadn't been seen in two
[16:40] thousand years what's that about well I
[16:43] believe that was the first fruits of a
[16:46] harvest that's about to come forth in
[16:48] this generation some have called it the
[16:51] harvest of harvesters where God is going
[16:54] to raise up a people who will function
[16:56] in the fullness of the authority of God
[16:59] as adopted sons that's our place the
[17:03] manifested sons of God those who are our
[17:08] Commission those who have graduated to
[17:10] that place where God has said I'm giving
[17:13] my authority into their hands they're
[17:16] conducting my business in the earth I'm
[17:18] backing them up I'm telling you it's a
[17:20] good day when you know God's backing up
[17:22] what you're doing now how is that going
[17:24] to happen it's going to have to be
[17:25] because we've come into a place of union
[17:28] and oneness with him where we have laid
[17:31] our mind and will and thoughts and
[17:33] emotions aside and we've taken on the
[17:35] mind of Christ as it sounds so big that
[17:37] you could never walk in that place with
[17:40] the enemy desire to keep you from it
[17:43] absolutely does he want to make it sound
[17:45] so grandiose and so big that that little
[17:48] old me and little oh you could never
[17:50] find it he wants it to be that way but
[17:52] brother sister it's not you see God new
[17:55] again before the foundation of the world
[17:57] who would be alive in this generation I
[18:02] believe this is the last of days the end
[18:05] of days but we're approaching the last
[18:08] of the last days I believe that we're
[18:10] coming into that final generation of
[18:13] people and there's going to be calamity
[18:16] and there's going to be wrath and
[18:17] there's going to be judgment and there's
[18:19] going to be darkness in the earth like
[18:21] never before but in the midst of gross
[18:24] darkness there's going to be a light
[18:27] that shines so brightly and that light
[18:31] is going to be the reflect
[18:33] Shin of Jesus Christ in a group of
[18:36] believers all over the world who have
[18:39] come to that place of maturity and
[18:42] adoption in him in 1943 a man by the
[18:46] name of TA sparks wrote an interesting
[18:50] statement and I don't think that
[18:52] necessarily ta sparks was a full gospel
[18:58] pentecostal charismatic prophetic
[19:01] believer like like maybe you are or this
[19:05] is sort of what our background is but he
[19:08] must have had something from the Lord
[19:09] because listen at what he wrote God will
[19:12] reach his end he will come in in his son
[19:18] in terms of sonship to take up residence
[19:23] with those or within those begotten of
[19:28] him those who are born of the Spirit now
[19:31] let's break that down God will come to
[19:33] the end he will come in in his son in
[19:37] terms of sonship to take up residence
[19:41] within those who are begotten of him and
[19:44] will grow in them see it is a process
[19:48] it's not a click click click 123 done
[19:51] finish your adopted there is an
[19:54] unfolding there is a revealing there's a
[19:57] teaching a process of of training that
[20:00] takes place he will grow in them he will
[20:05] increase his measure in them yes Lord
[20:09] yes Lord increase your measure in us
[20:12] until at last they are brought to the
[20:16] unity of the faith we need that they
[20:21] become a mighty embodiment and
[20:25] revelation of God himself do you hear
[20:29] those profound words of truth I hope so
[20:32] cuz I'm going to read it again I want
[20:35] you to really hear it God will reach his
[20:38] in he will come in in his son in terms
[20:41] of sonship to take up residence within
[20:45] those begotten of him
[20:46] and will grow in them I like that part
[20:50] because it is a growth we are growing
[20:53] God is doing something in us he will
[20:57] grow in them increase his measure in
[21:00] them the measure of his spirit until at
[21:03] last brought to the unity of the faith
[21:06] they become a mighty embodiment and
[21:11] revelation of God himself now he said
[21:16] not in deity but in what he is
[21:19] spiritually and morally in this universe
[21:25] conformed to the image of his son a
[21:28] living listen a living expression of
[21:32] God's on thoughts now isn't that a
[21:38] beautiful sermon that you and I might
[21:42] become a living expression of the very
[21:46] thoughts of God how will that happen
[21:49] well we have to we have to start
[21:51] thinking his thoughts we have to ask him
[21:54] to renew our mind we have to put on the
[21:57] mind of Christ so that our our thoughts
[22:00] began to dim as John the Baptist prayed
[22:03] I must decrease so that he might
[22:07] increase I believe that ta sparks was
[22:10] absolutely right I believe that God is
[22:13] going to have a people that he can
[22:14] reflect himself a people who will be the
[22:18] the very embodiment isn't that the word
[22:21] he used a mighty embodiment what does
[22:26] that mean it means the Word of God
[22:28] becoming flesh the embodiment and
[22:33] revelation of God himself you say the
[22:36] whole what is that that sounds so wild
[22:39] well it doesn't sound wild to me it
[22:41] sounds like what the world needs hey
[22:44] we've got to have something and we've
[22:46] got to have it in a hurry the church is
[22:49] not enough the church has not been doing
[22:51] enough good intentions well-meaning
[22:55] people but not enough is being
[22:57] accomplished we need a
[22:59] vine embodiment of the nature of God on
[23:02] the earth we need a company of people
[23:04] who are a revelation of God Himself who
[23:09] are a living expression of God's on
[23:13] thoughts and that's what he wants to do
[23:16] and he's looking somebody said how do I
[23:19] qualify well the place of qualification
[23:23] is the altar of surrender it's
[23:25] surrendering and it's ultimately
[23:28] surrendering not surrendering today
[23:30] giving in today and then picking up and
[23:33] doing it your way tomorrow it's a
[23:35] day-by-day surrendering lord I surrender
[23:40] Lord and not just with your words but
[23:43] with your life with your attitude with
[23:45] your actions with your reactions how we
[23:48] react to circumstances around us this
[23:52] whole thing that we're going through as
[23:55] Christians is a test we're being tested
[23:58] and tried so that the full measure the
[24:03] full stature of Jesus Christ as Peter
[24:06] called it can be expressed in us here in
[24:10] the end time I've written a couple notes
[24:14] here Christ will eventually fill this
[24:17] universe with himself through sonship by
[24:21] generating a mature body of people
[24:25] through faith he's going to feel you you
[24:28] read the scripture that talks about and
[24:31] the knowledge of the glory of the Lord
[24:34] shall fill the earth how because of a
[24:37] company of people who have become the
[24:39] embodiment and the revelation of God and
[24:43] the expression of God's own thoughts
[24:45] amatuer body remember the bride body is
[24:49] coming to maturity in our generation I
[24:52] believe that I believe that I I believe
[24:56] that this is the generation that's going
[24:59] to see the maturity of the bride body
[25:02] and all of those generations who have
[25:05] gone before us have contributed to
[25:07] today's maturing corporate Bride of
[25:10] Christ we could not be where
[25:13] we are if it had not been for those who
[25:16] have gone before us blazing the trail
[25:18] marking the way paying the price many of
[25:22] them by giving their own lives shedding
[25:24] their own blood going to the stake and
[25:27] being burned and we could go on and on
[25:30] talking about the Montross ities that
[25:32] the horrible horrendous deaths that men
[25:36] and women have died for the name of
[25:38] Jesus Christ for the very cause of Jesus
[25:44] Christ men have lost their lives and and
[25:47] are losing their lives today in other
[25:51] nations of the world what we need and in
[25:54] strong host you know there's religious
[25:56] error that has strong holds over nations
[25:59] any any religion that teaches that that
[26:04] there's many ways to God and and that
[26:06] Jesus is just another one of the holy
[26:08] men I'm telling you that's a strong hold
[26:11] that that takes families and nations by
[26:15] force and what we need in those nations
[26:19] is we need that embodiment we need that
[26:21] generation of men and women who will
[26:23] raise up with the signs and wonders of
[26:26] the of what we read about in the book of
[26:28] Acts in their lives and let's show let's
[26:31] let's come to a place where we stand at
[26:34] the Mount Carmel showdown and we can say
[26:36] the God who is the one true Living God
[26:39] let him answer by fire and watch fire
[26:42] fall from heaven to consume the
[26:44] sacrifice somebody said what in are you
[26:46] really talking about those kinds of
[26:48] things in modern times I'm telling you
[26:50] it's the only answer it's the only
[26:53] answer for the strongholds of philosophy
[26:56] and the strongholds of the New Age
[26:58] movement and the strongholds of false
[27:00] religion and hate religions it's the
[27:04] only answer is that here in the end time
[27:07] God raised up a people who are full of
[27:10] Jesus Christ who have his authority who
[27:13] speak the word and it comes to pass who
[27:15] lay hands on the sick and they recover
[27:17] who have authority over the the powers
[27:21] of the demonic and and which
[27:26] crafts and so many strong holes that we
[27:31] face sometimes in different areas you
[27:33] know we face different strongholds I
[27:35] don't know where you are right now I
[27:37] don't know what you're facing but I'm
[27:39] asking you to pray over these scriptures
[27:41] and and present yourself before the Lord
[27:44] and say Lord if you want to show
[27:46] yourself mightily through my life I'm
[27:49] ready to pay the price I'm ready to
[27:51] yield I'm ready to surrender father I
[27:54] ask you right now to help us to come to
[27:57] the place where you can come and live in
[27:59] our skin speak through our mouths use
[28:02] our hands and feet to further your cause

[28:08] wonderful name of Jesus Yeshua the
[28:10] Messiah we pray amen any man well thank
