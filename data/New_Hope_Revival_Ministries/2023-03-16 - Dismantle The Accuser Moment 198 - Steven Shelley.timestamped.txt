[0:00] it's hot time that we made it right
[0:03] before God you could shut down your
[0:06] accuser
[0:14] the enemy your adversary is standing
[0:18] against you and heriting what rightfully
[0:24] belongs to you he doesn't need it for
[0:27] himself he just wants to dispossess you
[0:31] remember he's the klepties the thief the
[0:35] one who steals
[0:37] not he steals for the thrill of stealing
[0:41] your adversary will steal your joy
[0:44] having no need of your joy
[0:47] but knowing that you have a legal right
[0:50] to it he places himself between you and
[0:55] your joy
[0:57] so you've got to move him out of the way
[1:01] you have to dispossess him before he
[1:05] dispossesses you
[1:07] you've got to dismantle him before he
[1:11] dismantles you you've got to steal his
[1:15] rights his right of accusation before he
[1:19] destroys you with his accusation
[1:23] in the spirit I begin to see
[1:26] prayers were being offered and I don't
[1:30] mean now I lay me down to sleep prayers
[1:35] it's all right that's good prayer do it
[1:37] but I mean strategic prayers
[1:40] prayers that called and pleaded the case
[1:43] before the Ancient of Days the righteous
[1:46] judge of all
[1:49] it came in such a way that that judge
[1:52] could not help he he could not refuse
[1:58] the petition
[2:00] because the petition was made based on
[2:03] the blood
[2:07] there's no higher price
[2:10] than the blood of Jesus
[2:12] because all this arguing that goes on in
[2:16] the courtroom of Eternity all this
[2:18] arguing and going on and the enemy
[2:20] standing there making his case about why
[2:23] you don't deserve
[2:27] and then and some of what he says is
[2:29] true and that's why you and I have a
[2:32] responsibility
[2:33] keep the dead cats off the line and walk
[2:35] in a state of repentance and I want to
[2:37] tell you something if you struggle with
[2:39] saying you're sorry you got bigger
[2:41] problems than that
[2:43] it's hot time that we made it right
[2:46] before God you could shut down your
[2:50] accuser
[2:52] you you could cause him to have to stand
[2:54] speedless speechless before the judge
[2:57] because there's nothing else to be said
[3:01] because you've repented and you've cried
[3:04] out to God and you've gone to your
[3:05] brother and you've gone to your sister
[3:07] and you've gotten it right
[3:09] and so now he just
[3:14] the judge says what is the accusation
[3:16] and normally the great sophist would
[3:19] just open his mouth and he would just
[3:21] begin to eloquently spew out all the
[3:23] things that you did wrong the way you
[3:25] didn't treat your wife right the way you
[3:27] didn't treat your children right the way
[3:28] you cheated on your job the way you took
[3:31] the stapler home that didn't belong to
[3:33] you but now it's all been made right
[3:35] it's all been confessed and the blood
[3:37] you'd be surprised what the blood calls
[3:39] into the courtroom
[3:41] that blood is pleaded
[3:45] when the great defense attorney of all
[3:47] times
[3:51] there is no argument he never has to
[3:53] argue on
[3:55] all he has to do is plead the
[4:00] there is no accusation that can stand
[4:02] against the power of the blood of Jesus
[4:03] Christ
[4:07] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[4:10] of my testimony
