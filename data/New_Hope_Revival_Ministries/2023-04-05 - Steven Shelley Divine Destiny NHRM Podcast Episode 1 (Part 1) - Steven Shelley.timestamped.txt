[0:06] [Music]
[0:09] podcast I'm Joshua Shelley and I am
[0:13] super excited about this uh it has
[0:15] something that has been in my heart for
[0:17] a long time to do
[0:18] and I'm super excited to start this off
[0:22] I took the idea to Hawk a couple weeks
[0:25] ago and told him that what I wanted to
[0:27] do with it and of course he jumped right
[0:30] on board I feel like this is a great way
[0:32] to get to so many different people young
[0:35] people and old people because I feel
[0:37] like everyone right now listens to
[0:38] podcasts and I think this is going to be
[0:41] something really big for us my goal is
[0:44] just to be able to interview different
[0:45] people in our church
[0:47] and hopefully some people from other
[0:49] churches if we can get them in different
[0:51] pastors and speakers to tell their
[0:53] stories their testimonies and their
[0:55] experiences and like I said I'm just
[0:57] super thrilled about this
[1:00] um I told Hawk that the first person of
[1:02] course I wanted to interview was not
[1:04] only my pastor Stephen Shelley but my
[1:07] dad there are so many different
[1:09] experiences that he has had through the
[1:12] years since he was a little child and I
[1:14] actually read a book
[1:17] um write the vision for the first time
[1:19] all the way through last night and found
[1:21] out so much more about it there was
[1:24] times where I was in tears and there was
[1:25] times where I was laughing and I'm just
[1:28] thrilled to be able to sit down with
[1:29] them and talk about all these
[1:31] experiences and different things
[1:33] uh there's so many that we're going to
[1:36] be able to go over and I can't wait so
[1:38] welcome to the podcast I'm happy to
[1:40] start this with you thank you so much
[1:42] Joshua I'm very excited I'm feeling a
[1:45] little bit emotional uh with your
[1:48] introduction there
[1:49] um that you finally read write the
[1:53] vision my testimony book that's going
[1:56] all over the world in the in the past uh
[1:59] nearly 30 years I'm very glad you
[2:02] finally got around to reading it I did
[2:04] uh Hawk told me it would be a good idea
[2:06] to go through that and to read it to
[2:08] find different questions and be able to
[2:10] find different things about you and so
[2:11] that's what I did and I was super super
[2:14] glad that I did because it has helped me
[2:16] a lot well I'm excited about the podcast
[2:18] I I have not been a big podcast listener
[2:22] I've listened to a few
[2:25] especially during covid I listened to
[2:28] some
[2:29] um but I know that it is appealing
[2:32] especially when when it's conversational
[2:35] and so I'm very excited that you have a
[2:38] burden to do this and I'm behind you 100
[2:41] percent and I'm honored to be your first
[2:43] guest well I'm excited I think it really
[2:45] just started because like I listen to
[2:48] tons of podcasts all my friends listen
[2:49] to podcasts and I was like this would be
[2:51] such a good way not only to get to young
[2:53] people but also older people right and
[2:54] be able to share some really good
[2:56] experiences and talk about the Lord
[2:57] right well I love stories true stories
[3:00] true experiences about the Lord and I
[3:03] know that there will be many in our
[3:06] church and many of our speakers that
[3:08] come through that will enjoy sharing and
[3:11] there's not a lot of podcasts that are
[3:13] just focused around the message and the
[3:15] truth that's true that's true that's
[3:17] true the revelation of Jesus Christ
[3:19] that's what the message is yes sir
[3:21] um I guess we're going to Jump Right In
[3:23] I want to talk to you about the first
[3:25] experience you had when you were I
[3:27] believe 18 months old that's correct and
[3:30] I think we're just going to go from
[3:31] there what what was to just explain to
[3:33] me that experience and what that was
[3:36] about before I do that I want to say
[3:38] just a few things to you and and to
[3:40] everyone watching or listening to the
[3:43] podcast
[3:45] um I want to first of all say that as I
[3:48] share my experiences I do not feel that
[3:53] I am a special person
[3:55] or that I have some special office to
[3:59] fulfill I do believe that all of us
[4:03] have a special role and a special a
[4:06] special place in the kingdom of God I
[4:09] believe that God has called you to do
[4:12] things that he hasn't called me to do
[4:14] and so I don't want to deny the calling
[4:17] but I don't want it to come across in
[4:20] the course of our time together as
[4:23] though I'm trying to elevate myself I
[4:26] struggle and I've always struggled
[4:28] because
[4:29] before I was born there were prophetic
[4:33] words spoken to my family that I would
[4:36] have a gifted life and that I would see
[4:39] visions and that I would hear from the
[4:43] Lord and that there would be experiences
[4:45] that would mark my life and I'm very
[4:48] thankful I want you to know and I want
[4:51] the listener to know that I am humbled
[4:54] and thankful and grateful to God that he
[4:58] would have called me
[4:59] uh but it has not been an easy calling
[5:03] because it's so misunderstood and if you
[5:06] share the things that God says or that
[5:09] you see he allows you to see uh
[5:12] sometimes it comes across to people as
[5:15] though you're trying to say I'm way up
[5:17] here and everybody else is and you know
[5:20] that's just not it at all I want you to
[5:21] know that and I want everyone uh joining
[5:25] us today to know that I wanted to read a
[5:28] scripture about experiences and then I
[5:31] will indeed go right where you asked me
[5:34] to go but in the Old Testament the
[5:37] prophet Joel prophesied in Joel chapter
[5:41] 2 verse 28 and it shall come to pass
[5:44] afterward that I will pour out my spirit
[5:48] upon All Flesh
[5:51] and your sons and your daughters shall
[5:54] prophesy your old men shall dream dreams
[5:58] your young men shall see visions
[6:02] so Joel was prophesying of an end time
[6:06] move of God
[6:08] we know that that end time move of God
[6:12] started in Acts chapter 2 when when the
[6:15] church was birthed but I personally do
[6:19] not believe that it is over in fact I
[6:23] believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ
[6:26] has some of our best days just ahead and
[6:31] when I say just ahead I don't mean
[6:33] decades ahead I mean now
[6:36] in Acts 2 17 Peter
[6:40] quotes the prophecy that Joel gave and
[6:45] it shall come to pass in the last days
[6:47] saith God I will pour out my spirit upon
[6:50] All Flesh your sons and your daughter
[6:52] shall prophesy your young men shall see
[6:54] visions and your old men shall dream
[6:57] dreams almost verbatim
[6:59] and Peter's message to those who were
[7:03] gathered that day was this is that this
[7:06] is that which the prophet Joel
[7:09] prophesied about
[7:12] and so I just want to say that I want to
[7:15] balance my perspective by saying
[7:19] um I don't I don't share what I share
[7:23] for someone to be in awe of my life
[7:27] but I share it because I want you to
[7:30] know that the promise is upon All Flesh
[7:34] it is God's desire to fill us with the
[7:39] Holy Ghost and to move Among Us with
[7:44] signs and wonders with dreams and
[7:47] Visions confirmations and vindications
[7:51] before I was born my mother was not a
[7:54] Believer my mother was raised in a in a
[7:58] nice home a beautiful family
[8:01] her father was retired military officer
[8:05] her mother was a housewife and a mom
[8:09] and my mother was the baby girl
[8:13] uh two older brothers and she was sort
[8:17] of spoiled
[8:19] that was her testimony anyway
[8:22] my mother was a beautiful young woman
[8:25] she was very popular in school
[8:28] and she met my father
[8:31] who was a handsome young man but they
[8:34] absolutely came from two incredibly
[8:37] different worlds
[8:39] uh she came from a little bit of
[8:41] affluence and
[8:44] um you know this military kind of
[8:47] background uh Baptist church on occasion
[8:51] and my father came from a Holy Roller
[8:54] family
[8:55] when he was 16 years old he was filled
[9:00] with the spirit of God and received a
[9:04] call to Ministry and the Lord spoke to
[9:08] him at a youth camp I believe it was in
[9:11] Forsyth Georgia
[9:13] which is not too far from here the Lord
[9:16] spoke through a servant of God and and
[9:18] told him that his desire for his life
[9:22] was that he would serve him in Ministry
[9:25] unfortunately my dad never never
[9:27] completely yielded to that call
[9:30] he got mixed in with the wrong crowd he
[9:33] was very talented musician and I didn't
[9:35] know that until last night I was reading
[9:37] the book and it said he got caught up in
[9:39] one of the services that he took mall to
[9:42] and they asked him to play the piano and
[9:43] Ma got scared and was saying when you
[9:45] say mo you mean my mother your your
[9:48] grandmother and she got scared I was
[9:49] like you're not going to leave me are
[9:50] you and I didn't know he played the
[9:51] piano or anything I actually forgot that
[9:53] that was even yeah yeah but she was
[9:57] eventually invited I don't think he told
[10:00] her from the start you know that his
[10:03] mother was an evangelist and that his
[10:05] family traveled all over the southern
[10:08] part of the United States and also the
[10:11] Eastern Seaboard
[10:13] preaching and singing and uh you know I
[10:16] mean everybody's proud of their family
[10:18] but I when I tell you that my dad could
[10:20] play the piano I'm telling you he he
[10:23] really played he was in in those years
[10:25] he was often compared to Jimmy Swaggart
[10:28] and Mickey Gilley and and Jerry Lee
[10:30] Lewis
[10:31] um but that pull of that music you know
[10:35] uh it it got out that he was very
[10:37] talented and and so it wasn't just
[10:40] church it was it was the the Moose Club
[10:43] and the Elk Lodge and the Shriners and
[10:46] the different societies uh my
[10:48] grandfather was uh was a supervisor in a
[10:51] cotton meal and they wanted my dad to
[10:53] come and play the piano and this grieved
[10:55] my grandmother because she knew that the
[10:58] gift that God had given him was for God
[11:01] it was to be used in the service of the
[11:03] Lord but anyway yes he he did eventually
[11:06] get my mother to a service and there was
[11:09] a local family I don't know if I would
[11:11] have called the name or not but they
[11:12] were they were very Pentecostal people
[11:15] stensons was their name they were
[11:18] singers
[11:19] and I think a lot of them are passed on
[11:22] but they got up and they began to sing
[11:25] and my my mom there were not me I don't
[11:28] think they were they might not have even
[11:29] been married yet if they were they had
[11:32] just been married newly married
[11:35] and uh so people began to shout and and
[11:38] they begin to speak in tongues and my
[11:40] mother literally had never been in a
[11:43] service like that in her life people
[11:46] were talking in tongues and running the
[11:48] aisles and and and women were shouting
[11:51] their hairpins out and my mother was
[11:53] terrified she told me I was holding on
[11:55] to the seat for dear life and
[11:58] [Music]
[11:59] um
[12:00] they they eventually I don't think she
[12:02] knew what was going to happen but my dad
[12:04] knew uh that that the Shelley family was
[12:07] going to be called to sing
[12:09] and so she grabbed a hold of my my dad
[12:13] whose name was Ralph and she said you
[12:16] are not leaving me you are not leaving
[12:18] me here but you know he had no choice
[12:21] they were called to to sing and anyway
[12:24] she made it through but she told some
[12:27] amazing Stories uh and and yeah she had
[12:30] some good stories you know many years
[12:31] later she also uh surrendered her life
[12:36] to the Lord and was baptized with the
[12:37] Holy Ghost but anyway in some of those
[12:40] Services there were prophetic people
[12:42] that God would speak to that he would
[12:45] show Visions just like Joel said just
[12:47] like Peter said in the book of Acts
[12:50] and but my mother was never regular to
[12:54] church
[12:56] um not not to the Pentecostal Church
[12:58] and so uh one Saturday night in the
[13:04] church that my grandmother was uh was
[13:07] pastoring at the time
[13:10] which in fact is really the church that
[13:13] we're in now
[13:15] um because I came my grandmother stepped
[13:18] aside as Pastor when she realized that
[13:21] that was not God's perfect will for her
[13:24] life according to the word she very soon
[13:28] after that was taken from us and I was
[13:31] voted in as Pastor so technically this
[13:34] nhrm is the church that was so was it
[13:38] always New Hope it was always New Hope
[13:40] it used to be called New Hope assembly
[13:43] prayer Center okay and uh many years ago
[13:46] the name was changed to New Hope Revival
[13:49] Center but prayer has still been an
[13:51] important part of what we do I know I'm
[13:54] going all the way around the world to
[13:55] tell this story so just interrupt me
[13:57] whenever whenever you need to but
[14:00] um anyway the church let me just tell
[14:04] you a little bit about the church the
[14:05] church itself started because my
[14:08] grandmother had a burden and her heart
[14:10] for North Columbus and North Columbus in
[14:14] those days I'll tell you the year was
[14:15] 1968 it was the year I was born
[14:18] that my grandmother heard the call
[14:21] to open a church a really she was told
[14:26] to open a prayer Center and that's why
[14:28] it was initially called New Hope
[14:30] assembly prayer Center
[14:32] she was told to assemble a prayer Center
[14:34] so it was called New Hope assembly
[14:37] prayer Center and it was in North
[14:39] Columbus and she was with a major
[14:41] Pentecostal denomination at that time
[14:43] she was ordained
[14:45] with a with a large Pentecostal
[14:47] denomination so she went to her
[14:49] denomination and she asked for
[14:51] permission to open a Mission Church in
[14:54] North Columbus which at the time was was
[14:58] a poor part of town now if you because
[15:01] you work in the public in in the rain
[15:05] gutter business with brother Greeley you
[15:08] know that North Columbus now is a very
[15:11] affluent part of Columbus part of
[15:13] Muskogee County the wealthier homes are
[15:16] there but in those days it was a lot of
[15:19] shanties and Shacks
[15:21] and the the denomination didn't want her
[15:24] to do it maybe because she was a woman
[15:27] but now they had ordained her to preach
[15:29] uh uh or maybe they didn't feel like I
[15:32] don't know what it was but it wounded
[15:34] her it really really hurt her hurt her
[15:36] because she had a great reputation uh uh
[15:39] in in this in the city for for praying
[15:43] for people and then being healed and so
[15:46] she thought that that the denomination
[15:48] would be right behind her well anyway
[15:50] they were not and her nephew Johnny
[15:54] Walker anybody watches this saying
[15:56] here's it my my no might have known
[15:58] Johnny
[15:59] he's been gone for years he was a
[16:02] preacher talented musician here in the
[16:04] area he went out and with his cousin
[16:08] James Williams I think and they found an
[16:12] old building on the side of the road
[16:15] Hamilton Road in Columbus that was
[16:20] initially used as a honky tonk really
[16:23] and if you're watching this overseas and
[16:26] you don't know what a honky tonk is it's
[16:28] it's worse than a bar okay it's a bar
[16:33] is is much classier than what we're
[16:35] thinking when we think of honky tonk
[16:37] we're talking about roof well it was
[16:39] called Mary's Place
[16:41] and it's because it was run by a woman
[16:44] who had one leg
[16:46] and uh she sat behind a Podium with a a
[16:52] shotgun
[16:53] and I've had many people tell me that
[16:56] they partied at Mary's place so this is
[16:58] this has been confirmed many times
[17:00] through the years
[17:02] um and she if if anybody got to causing
[17:06] too much Ruckus she'd just pull that
[17:07] shotgun out and shoot right through the
[17:09] roof I never knew that yeah Mary's place
[17:12] and I have a picture of the building in
[17:14] my office and and so my grandmother they
[17:18] took my granny and said well here this
[17:19] is only place well the problem is it had
[17:22] been a vacant for years all the windows
[17:25] busted out of it in fact Joshua this is
[17:28] just gross but uh it was being used as a
[17:33] as an outhouse the back part of of the
[17:36] of what would be the church building
[17:38] eventually the back part where the
[17:40] fellowship was uh there was a door that
[17:44] came in out of the woods and there were
[17:45] people living in shanties up in the
[17:48] woods coming into this building which
[17:50] was nicer than what they were living in
[17:52] and using it for an outhouse wow and so
[17:55] when my grandmother said yes that's it
[17:58] that's the building
[17:59] uh they it took a month to clean it up
[18:02] and they use shovels
[18:04] and they cleaned up human waste
[18:07] they cleaned up blood from the from the
[18:10] fights at Mary's place they replaced all
[18:13] the window panes and they called a
[18:16] prayer meeting and that's how our church
[18:19] started it started with prayer meetings
[18:21] and we're talking about a church that
[18:24] was heated with with uh pot-bellied hot
[18:27] uh hot excuse me pot-bellied uh wood
[18:31] stoves
[18:32] and they did get hot uh and
[18:36] it eventually
[18:38] in the first year or so had outhouses
[18:42] but but they were able to add Plumbing
[18:44] to it uh a couple years after the church
[18:47] started about about 69 or 70 they added
[18:50] indoor plumbing
[18:52] and my granny began to have services on
[18:55] Tuesday night
[18:56] so that it wouldn't affect the other
[18:58] churches and Saturday night
[19:00] because none of the churches were having
[19:02] church on Saturday night and then she
[19:04] and a few of the the locals would come
[19:06] on Sunday morning and have a service
[19:08] well in one of those Saturday night
[19:10] services the Holy Ghost fell and there
[19:13] were several women and men who
[19:15] prophesied
[19:17] and uh I believe it was a sister who
[19:21] went over to my grandmother and laid
[19:23] hands on her head
[19:25] and said to her the Lord would say unto
[19:29] you
[19:30] that the the child your daughter-in-law
[19:35] is carrying right now is chosen
[19:39] and I'm going to use him uh for the
[19:43] ministry
[19:44] and it went on uh one of the things that
[19:48] were spoken was that I would win more
[19:50] souls have more miracles than even my
[19:54] grandmother had seen in her in her days
[19:56] of being which is probably a lot it a
[19:59] lot you know I mean she's like from the
[20:02] corner of the book she traveled and like
[20:03] you said she traveled around maybe
[20:05] you'll maybe you'll have me back on
[20:07] sometime and I can tell big mama stories
[20:09] because uh you know how God used her was
[20:13] profound and and I said to you just
[20:15] before the podcast started when we were
[20:17] just chatting I I told you that when you
[20:20] were with my grandmother you knew you
[20:22] were with a great person not just not
[20:25] just a grandmother or or a sweet
[20:29] lady but you knew that you were in the
[20:32] presence of someone who had known who
[20:35] had really known the Lord and she did
[20:39] she certainly did and and so the
[20:42] prophecy went on well my mother wasn't a
[20:44] wasn't there
[20:45] she wasn't even a believer
[20:48] yet this prophecy said now
[20:51] my father I told you he had had a call
[20:54] he he he rejected the call could it be I
[20:58] don't know son I don't know I don't have
[21:00] the scripture
[21:01] could it be that because he refused the
[21:04] call
[21:05] it fell on me and and I'm now carrying
[21:09] the ministry that would have been his
[21:11] I kind of like to think that
[21:14] but I don't know if that's true or not
[21:16] I know God never makes a mistake I know
[21:19] that and I wish that my dad would have
[21:22] went on to yield to his to his call but
[21:24] he did not
[21:25] and so my grandmother was thrilled I
[21:28] mean she she told my mother
[21:30] she said Jane I don't know how you're
[21:32] going to feel about this
[21:34] because my mother she would not hesitate
[21:37] to tell you that that my granny was a
[21:41] Holy Roller that's what they called
[21:43] called them Holy Rollers
[21:45] and and in those days people would say
[21:49] they tell tales about Holy Rollers
[21:51] they'd say
[21:52] that they've put itching powder on
[21:55] people when they come for prayer and
[21:57] that's what made them respond the way
[21:58] they did you know they'd get excited and
[22:02] they said that was itching powder and
[22:04] they would tell that the Holy Rollers
[22:06] were swinging from the chandeliers well
[22:07] there were no chandeliers they were just
[22:10] naked light bulbs hanging down out of
[22:12] the ceiling and so people didn't
[22:14] understand Pentecost even in 1968
[22:19] when I was born there were still people
[22:22] who did not understand Pentecost now I
[22:25] want to tell you
[22:28] and I really am going to share about the
[22:30] experience
[22:32] uh I want to tell you that I feel so
[22:36] blessed son because the Pentecostal
[22:40] church had
[22:43] um grown in the in the nation and it had
[22:46] it had got a little more popular
[22:49] and as it got popular
[22:53] uh the power of God seemed to begin to
[22:57] to dwindle a little bit as the people
[22:59] put more emphasis on patting the Pew and
[23:03] a stained glass windows and and fancier
[23:07] buildings and more programs the power of
[23:11] God seemed to dwindle but my grandmother
[23:13] wouldn't let that happen
[23:15] she was determined through prayer
[23:19] to to to maintain an atmosphere where
[23:23] people could be healed and delivered and
[23:25] set free and so I I come along now in a
[23:29] few years in the story and I saw demons
[23:33] cast out
[23:34] and the dead raised
[23:37] and when I tell you that I have seen
[23:40] Blind Eyes Open by the power of Jesus
[23:43] Christ I'm telling you the whole truth
[23:45] and nothing but the truth I've seen deaf
[23:48] ears unstopped and I've watched death
[23:52] mutes
[23:53] speak their first words
[23:56] because of the power of Jesus Christ and
[24:00] so my grandmother wanted to kind of keep
[24:02] that kind of an atmosphere and although
[24:04] she was doing God a service without
[24:07] being in his perfect will she did
[24:09] everything she knew to do
[24:11] and I'll tell you sometime how she even
[24:14] came to do that what happened in in her
[24:17] life that caused her to even pray that
[24:20] prayer and begin to do but
[24:22] so my mother heard heard this prophecy
[24:25] and my dad heard it
[24:28] and my dad had no problem believing it
[24:31] but my mother didn't know what to think
[24:33] about it
[24:34] and so the first time I had a spiritual
[24:38] experience
[24:40] I have never
[24:42] talked about the detail every little
[24:45] detail of that experience and as far as
[24:48] I know I've never really shared what was
[24:50] spoken to me
[24:51] but I will tell you this I was 18 months
[24:56] old and I was standing in my baby bed
[25:01] and somebody said well I don't believe
[25:04] that you can uh you know remember when
[25:07] you were 18 months old I I do I have
[25:10] memories of laying in the crib and
[25:13] looking up at the ceiling when I was
[25:15] younger than that Vivid memories
[25:19] I can describe right now my bedroom when
[25:24] I was a baby I know the furniture
[25:27] and and so I guess maybe part of the
[25:30] gift was
[25:32] a memory like that
[25:34] but I tell people you don't encounter
[25:36] God Supernatural God
[25:39] and and not remember it I don't care if
[25:41] you're 81 or 18 months old
[25:45] it's kind of hard to forget I think
[25:47] you're going to remember that and so I
[25:51] know again that it it confuses some
[25:54] people but let me tell you this Joshua
[25:55] I'm not here today
[25:57] and when I stand in that Pulpit up there
[26:00] I'm not up there either to convince
[26:02] anybody that what I have seen is real
[26:06] I can't do that I cannot make you
[26:09] believe that I saw anything or that I
[26:12] heard anything I can't make you believe
[26:14] that but that's not really my job my job
[26:18] is to testify to be a witness of what
[26:21] I've seen and what I've heard and what I
[26:24] know but it's up to you
[26:26] just like it is your siblings just like
[26:28] it is to every person connected to this
[26:31] podcast today they have to make up their
[26:34] own mind of whether these things are
[26:35] real and I'm I'm I'm telling you they're
[26:39] real he's so profoundly visited me in my
[26:43] in my baby bed standing up I was already
[26:46] I was already escaping
[26:49] my baby bed at 18 months old
[26:51] and
[26:53] um and getting into things
[26:56] I wasn't two years old and we took a
[27:00] family trip to Miami my my dad worked
[27:03] for the airlines
[27:05] and we took a trip to Miami and I
[27:07] distinctly remember
[27:09] not quite two but almost two crawling
[27:12] out of the bed that they are maybe like
[27:14] a playpen type thing they had for me
[27:16] there going into the bathroom crawling
[27:19] into the tub opening up the ice chest
[27:23] and eating almost a half of a summer
[27:27] sausage that was about that big
[27:29] now I remember doing that you say well
[27:33] you remember your your parents telling
[27:35] you I do I remember them telling me
[27:37] about it but I have memory of how hard
[27:39] it was to get over into that bathtub and
[27:41] get that thing open and eat almost half
[27:44] of a summer sausage they said that was
[27:45] about that long so I I was you know I
[27:49] was moving differently and already
[27:50] already you know uh walking around I
[27:55] walked before 12 months about 10 months
[27:57] is when I started walking so anyway
[28:01] my next experience if you want to hear
[28:04] about that that was 18 months there was
[28:06] one in the book about when you were like
[28:07] three years old is that the one you're
[28:09] going to yep yep
[28:10] my next experience changed my life
[28:13] forever I am here today
[28:16] because of what happened to me when I
[28:19] was three years old and next well
[28:21] tomorrow uh is is we're in the month of
[28:25] April soon and April 28th is my birthday
[28:28] I'll be 55 so that's been a long time
[28:31] ago since I was three
[28:33] 52 years but I remember it well
[28:37] we were living on Emerson Avenue in
[28:40] Columbus
[28:41] my parents I didn't know it at the time
[28:44] but my parents were already having
[28:46] problems and they divorced they divorced
[28:49] when I was five
[28:51] but I was three now and I can describe
[28:54] the the bedroom to you there was
[28:56] linoleum on the floor that sticky kind
[29:00] of linoleum you know that when you walk
[29:01] across it barefooted your feet stick to
[29:04] it there was a yellow
[29:08] ugly oval yellow shag looking rug with a
[29:12] fringe around it
[29:14] in the middle of the room
[29:16] I had a twin bed at the time I think I
[29:20] had Mickey Mouse uh bedspread and
[29:24] curtains and pillows
[29:26] I had a Mickey Mouse
[29:28] record player in the corner
[29:32] and uh I had a section in the corner of
[29:36] toys that I would later play church with
[29:40] uh and a small piano was given to me
[29:43] there was something that was funny in
[29:45] the book uh uh your granny had told I
[29:49] think it was a congregation or somebody
[29:51] she said uh Steve's got the most
[29:53] Sanctified teddy bears uh there is yeah
[29:56] because after this happened when I was
[29:58] three from that moment on I called
[30:00] myself a preacher that's right yeah I
[30:02] said she said that uh I was asleep one
[30:05] night on my stomach in the bed and
[30:09] something woke me up
[30:11] I heard something moving in the room
[30:15] I very slowly raised my head up and
[30:18] turned my shoulder in the in the bed and
[30:21] looked at the door because the noise was
[30:23] coming from the door
[30:25] and hovering above the floor
[30:30] several feet above the floor I saw
[30:34] the image of the Lord Jesus Christ
[30:38] uh
[30:40] it was so profound did you know right
[30:42] away that that's what it was I I I don't
[30:45] know exactly at what moment it hit me
[30:48] that that's who it was maybe maybe first
[30:51] my thought was an angel but it was it
[30:53] was it was soon
[30:56] it was uh
[30:58] uh not long that I realized if not
[31:01] immediately that it was the Lord Jesus
[31:03] Christ and it scared me nearly to death
[31:08] I can remember the feeling of the of the
[31:12] spit drying up in my mouth and my tongue
[31:14] feeling like it was it was swelling I
[31:17] was so afraid and I immediately
[31:20] turned my head back over and buried my
[31:23] face in the pillow now Joshua I heard
[31:27] the Lord
[31:28] when he
[31:30] landed I hate to say it that way when he
[31:33] touched the floor
[31:35] I heard the Lord touch down
[31:38] and I heard his sticky footprints
[31:42] as he walked across
[31:44] the floor through the years
[31:48] people have said well that couldn't have
[31:49] been a vision had to be more like a
[31:51] visitation because it was physical in
[31:54] the sense that I physically heard sticky
[31:57] feet step step step step across the
[32:01] floor and here's the thing that that's
[32:04] so vivid In My Memory when he got to the
[32:07] rug I knew it
[32:09] because I didn't hear the sticky
[32:11] Footprints anymore
[32:13] and then all of a sudden he stepped off
[32:15] the rug because the rug was in the
[32:17] middle of the room he stepped off the
[32:19] rug and brother when I knew he was
[32:22] almost to my bed I was shaking the whole
[32:24] bed was shaking
[32:26] now that's the truth
[32:28] and Joshua you know again you you can
[32:31] believe it the viewer the Lister can
[32:34] believe it or not believe it it's
[32:35] totally up to you
[32:37] but he touched me on the back of my neck
[32:42] and when he did he didn't have to say I
[32:45] believe he said first
[32:47] do not be afraid
[32:49] but he didn't have to say that
[32:52] because the minute I felt his hand on
[32:56] the back of my neck my fear subsided I
[33:00] was no longer afraid
[33:02] and I he could have carried me anywhere
[33:05] I would have gone with him that's the
[33:07] truth because I I was at perfect peace
[33:12] now I turned all the way over and looked
[33:14] looked up into his face
[33:17] that was
[33:19] brilliant
[33:21] uh lovely brilliant light
[33:25] coming off of his face
[33:28] I saw enough of the details to know that
[33:32] it was
[33:34] the Lord and
[33:37] but there was such a light coming from
[33:40] him and and almost like a Mist coming
[33:43] off of him
[33:45] and he sat down on the bed
[33:48] and he never took his hand off of me the
[33:51] whole time first it was the back of my
[33:54] neck and then it was my shoulder and
[33:56] then then my near my the top of my wrist
[34:00] while he was talking to me
[34:02] now my eyes were glued on him
[34:05] but there was no fear
[34:08] and he told me many things
[34:12] I don't know how long he was with me
[34:14] but he told me many things many of which
[34:17] I told my mother
[34:19] the next morning
[34:21] what was her reaction to that she did
[34:24] not know what to do with it
[34:26] she did not know what to do with it I'll
[34:29] tell you how that happened in a minute
[34:32] he told me that I would preach the
[34:35] gospel
[34:37] he told me that there would be Miracles
[34:39] with signs and wonders
[34:41] he told me that he would give me a
[34:44] people to lead well I now know that
[34:46] that's what I do as a pastor but I
[34:49] didn't know that then
[34:50] I'll give you a people to lead
[34:53] he he told me that my life would be hard
[34:57] and that it would be so hard
[35:00] that there would be people who would
[35:03] come to me through the years and say
[35:06] your testimony
[35:09] has helped me so much because if God
[35:12] particularly young people if God can
[35:16] help you through those difficult times I
[35:18] know he can get me through mine and that
[35:20] has happened just like God said it I
[35:22] mean just like Jesus spoke to me that
[35:24] that night it has happened that way he
[35:28] also told me that my parents were going
[35:29] to divorce
[35:31] and he told me that my life would be
[35:33] lonely
[35:34] but that he would always be with me did
[35:37] you tell did you tell your mother I did
[35:39] you told her that can you imagine
[35:41] looking at your young beautiful mother
[35:44] as a as a three or oh I mean as a fight
[35:47] just just just three years old
[35:50] and telling her that Jesus has appeared
[35:53] to you
[35:54] and that your he told you that your
[35:57] mommy and daddy were going to be
[35:58] divorced how did she take she sobbed
[36:02] she cried because she she knew that you
[36:06] know I probably had a good imagination I
[36:09] I don't know she never you know
[36:11] mentioned to me that I did but but she
[36:14] knew this wasn't me I I know in my heart
[36:17] and we have video somewhere of mother
[36:19] telling this uh or uh referring to it
[36:23] at one of my preaching anniversaries
[36:26] and uh she will I I think in that in
[36:31] that little talk she told that there
[36:34] were no words to describe what it felt
[36:36] like uh she didn't know what to do with
[36:38] it or what to think about it but she
[36:40] knew that I had not lied she knew that I
[36:43] had not told a lie
[36:45] and
[36:47] so so my life that from that moment was
[36:50] set on a on a on a course that I'm still
[36:54] on to this day so I never dreamed about
[36:59] being anything but what Jesus told me I
[37:02] was going to be a preacher and from that
[37:05] moment is that when you believe you were
[37:06] called to preach I believe that was my
[37:08] calling and there are strategically I'm
[37:11] leaving some things out
[37:13] but he said some things to me in that in
[37:17] that visitation I'm going to call it
[37:19] what I believe it was
[37:21] he said some things to me in that
[37:23] visitation
[37:24] again I know that in the days we're
[37:27] living in in social media Etc that I'm
[37:30] giving people an opportunity to to call
[37:33] it baloney and and to say whatever they
[37:36] want to say uh but I'm going to leave
[37:38] that with them
[37:39] uh there has to be something to it
[37:41] because I never ever dreamed desired
[37:45] wanted to be anything or to do anything
[37:48] else I wasn't looking for a meal ticket
[37:51] I wasn't looking to be paid I wasn't
[37:54] looking for a career
[37:56] in Ministry I was only Desiring to do to
[38:00] be obedient to what he had called me to
[38:03] do
[38:04] and again my mother was shook I didn't
[38:07] even have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[38:10] I didn't receive the baptism of the Holy
[38:12] Ghost until I was seven years old and
[38:14] we're going to talk about that because
[38:15] that was in the book and I thought that
[38:16] was a pretty neat experience as well so
[38:19] when when uh
[38:21] when I turned five
[38:24] my mother's father I remember it vividly
[38:28] his name was Edwin Lamar Ellis and I'm
[38:33] named after him my name is Stephen Lamar
[38:37] uh he had heart trouble he had been when
[38:40] I was a little boy to uh Walter Reed
[38:43] hospital
[38:45] and had open heart surgery and had done
[38:47] very well for a few years
[38:50] we had gone to Panama City
[38:53] for a little family vacation we had
[38:55] gotten back that night
[38:57] my grandparents had gone into their
[38:59] apartment mother and I had gone because
[39:02] my dad was already gone I should have
[39:04] finished that but my dad was had already
[39:06] left
[39:08] yes he wasn't living with us at the time
[39:11] they were not divorced but he wasn't
[39:14] living with us at the time and I I can
[39:16] tell you right now I can relive the
[39:19] moment in the middle of the night about
[39:21] 2 A.M
[39:22] when the phone rang and my mother
[39:24] screamed
[39:26] the most blood curdling scream I've ever
[39:29] heard as she was hearing the news that
[39:32] her dad had died on the way to the
[39:34] hospital
[39:36] she loved him so much he was so strong
[39:38] and he had been so supportive of her
[39:42] with my dad leaving and just being Mom
[39:45] and I
[39:46] he was gone before we could ever get to
[39:49] the hospital he was DOA Dead on Arrival
[39:52] at the hospital
[39:53] shortly thereafter
[39:55] my dad came to tell my mother that he
[39:58] did not love her anymore and that they
[40:00] were going to be divorced now I was
[40:02] shattered even though
[40:04] even though I had this warning
[40:06] I was still shattered
[40:09] I didn't I didn't see my dad a whole lot
[40:13] he worked a lot and he hunted a lot
[40:16] and and I know hunting is important to
[40:19] certain people
[40:20] but it sure it sure took my dad away
[40:24] from me on on days that were important
[40:27] to a child my birthday Christmas
[40:28] Thanksgiving
[40:30] it sure took my dad away from me he was
[40:32] obsessed
[40:34] and I remember uh I remember the day
[40:38] Joshua that he came and told my mother
[40:40] then he asked to speak to me he sat me
[40:43] down on the bench of the picnic table
[40:45] and told me that he didn't love my
[40:47] mother anymore he still cared about me
[40:49] were his words
[40:51] I don't know if he used the word love
[40:54] but he still cared about me and that he
[40:58] uh but he had to go and I remember
[41:00] holding on to his leg
[41:03] and not letting him go I remember him
[41:06] walking up the driveway to his car and
[41:09] me still holding on step stepping on his
[41:11] foot and holding onto his leg and I
[41:14] remember that last moment it must have
[41:16] been difficult for him I'm not I'm not
[41:18] in any way trying to to to say that it
[41:20] wasn't painful for him but I remember
[41:23] the moment that he reached down and
[41:24] pushed me off of his leg and shut the
[41:26] door
[41:27] now that that's a pretty vivid rejection
[41:30] but even that it certainly affected my
[41:33] life but even that
[41:35] did not pull me off the course I knew
[41:39] that I was bound to serve the Lord I
[41:43] knew I was
[41:44] my mother remarried she married an
[41:46] abusive man he beat her multiple times
[41:50] put her in the hospital multiple times
[41:54] and life was hard and my mother would
[41:57] grab me up in the night and run with me
[42:00] and I remember her panting so loud from
[42:03] the from the blood loss
[42:06] hiding in the bushes I can show you the
[42:08] spot right now in Columbus
[42:10] the bushes that we were hiding in
[42:13] and when he found us and I remember
[42:15] thinking in my heart oh I have oh mother
[42:18] please don't be so loud but she was
[42:21] panting for breath from the beating
[42:23] and running
[42:25] and he heard her and you know drug us
[42:28] back into the house
[42:30] and and and there were many times I I
[42:33] saw him stand in the hallway of my room
[42:37] going into my room my mother against the
[42:40] wall and him put his back against the
[42:42] wall and take his feet and the full
[42:45] force of his feet
[42:47] uh pin my mother to the wall and kick
[42:50] her in the stomach
[42:51] multiple times me screaming at the top
[42:54] of my lungs
[42:56] and I saw my mother uh you know beat
[42:59] with a diamond ring
[43:03] and uh
[43:04] even her mother
[43:06] picked up
[43:08] and thrown across the living room floor
[43:10] because of anger
[43:13] and so times were hard and it was
[43:17] difficult he moved us away to an island
[43:20] off the coast of Georgia
[43:22] I was not allowed to go to church
[43:25] uh I don't know if he thought I would
[43:27] tell somebody what was going on this was
[43:30] her second husband
[43:31] I don't know why but I wasn't allowed to
[43:33] go to church and uh you know it just
[43:37] it's I'm almost reliving some of it now
[43:40] talking about it but but it was horrible
[43:42] and and I really feared
[43:46] when I knew that she was off work and he
[43:48] was off work and I was at school I
[43:50] really feared at times that I would come
[43:52] home and find her dead God's grace and
[43:56] mercy kept that from happening
[43:58] uh
[44:00] uh my dog was killed in an episode
[44:03] and it seemed at that time that I felt
[44:07] like everything I had ever loved was was
[44:10] destroyed uh by this bad relationship
[44:15] and yet there was something about that
[44:17] man that I couldn't hate
[44:20] uh because I I felt like he also had
[44:24] missed a call he had missed something in
[44:27] his life to serve the Lord
[44:29] and and so I couldn't hate him even
[44:32] though he was crazy
[44:34] and so abusive
[44:36] and one day Joshua my mother just before
[44:39] I was seven
[44:41] my mother come home from the bank and
[44:43] she said we're going to grab what we can
[44:46] and in the morning we're going to leave
[44:49] well I was I was elated I was so happy I
[44:52] thought oh I get to go home I get to be
[44:55] around my grandmother's
[44:57] especially my grandmother who went to
[44:59] church and and uh the Pentecostal Church
[45:04] and and I thought my life would just you
[45:07] know this this is a dream come true
[45:09] and the next morning we got what little
[45:12] bit we could
[45:14] I remember that I had just gotten a
[45:16] birthday present of a of a of a magic
[45:19] set
[45:21] and uh just a big box of little tricks
[45:25] that you could do for your friends and I
[45:27] you know maybe I wouldn't have even
[45:29] given that to my children but it was
[45:31] given to me
[45:32] and I liked it so much
[45:35] enjoyed it so much I remember a little
[45:38] tray that you could stick a coin in and
[45:41] and and make the coin disappear in the
[45:43] little slot in the tray you know that
[45:45] kind of thing it was it all all had a a
[45:48] trick behind it but I wasn't able my
[45:50] mother wouldn't let me take that because
[45:52] the box was so big
[45:54] so I remember leaving things behind I
[45:56] remember having to leave my Nerf ball
[45:58] behind because there wasn't enough room
[46:00] to get everything we needed necessities
[46:03] we left that morning
[46:06] we made it to McDonald's on the
[46:08] outskirts of Brunswick Georgia
[46:11] and my mother was very solemn we sat
[46:13] there eating the the breakfast the Egg
[46:16] McMuffin
[46:17] and my mother was so solemn and I said
[46:20] mother I'm so thankful I'm so glad to be
[46:23] going home I'm so thankful to be going
[46:26] home and and for you to be safe and out
[46:28] of this
[46:29] and uh I mean I'm was five but but you
[46:34] know I would think bright for my age
[46:35] that sounds pretty bragging doesn't it
[46:37] but
[46:38] uh I had a better grip on life than than
[46:42] than most five-year-olds I've been
[46:44] through enough at that point and I'm so
[46:46] excited and my mother said Steve I have
[46:49] to tell you something
[46:51] and I said what is it and she said I've
[46:54] decided to go back
[46:56] to Jerry that was his name
[46:59] and and I said mother
[47:01] if I can't go to church
[47:04] if I can't serve the Lord see even
[47:07] though I didn't have the Holy Ghost I'd
[47:08] had those two main spiritual encounters
[47:11] with the Lord and I had been in a few
[47:13] Services my grandmother said that when I
[47:17] preached my first sermon I had only been
[47:20] to church with her about a half a dozen
[47:21] times so so I had only been to church
[47:25] you know about six times
[47:27] but that presence son that presence of
[47:30] God
[47:32] that was in that church the peace that
[47:34] was in that church these were old hard
[47:36] Mill workers
[47:39] ladies that would come in with cotton
[47:41] batting in their hair where they had
[47:44] just got off work in the cotton meal and
[47:46] come to church still unpresentable you
[47:49] would think by today's standard
[47:51] many many men
[47:54] would go in that bath back bathroom of
[47:57] the old church and wash their faces and
[47:59] wash their hands their hands black where
[48:02] they had worked on those looms and just
[48:04] got off work and come to church and had
[48:06] to clean up in the bathroom at the
[48:08] church so they could come in service but
[48:10] do you think they would have missed the
[48:11] service those people wouldn't have
[48:13] missed a service for any reason
[48:16] they were so sincere and I longed to be
[48:20] in that presence
[48:21] and to feel what I felt when I was those
[48:25] few times with my with my granny praying
[48:28] around the altars
[48:30] we had a lot of God Encounters in my
[48:33] grandmother's home
[48:34] but I long to be in church
[48:37] and I said mother if I can't go to
[48:39] church I want to die I want to die I'm
[48:41] going to pray and ask Jesus to let me
[48:43] die I have nothing to live for if I
[48:47] can't be in church and serve God now
[48:49] what what means as a five-year-old boy
[48:51] that's got to be a pretty what made a
[48:53] five-year-old say that my experience
[48:56] with him that's how it really was
[48:59] you can say what you want to
[49:02] but you would never ever
[49:06] be able to convince me it wasn't real it
[49:08] didn't happen
[49:10] and and I just sobbed I mean I lay my
[49:13] head over on the on the table and I just
[49:16] sobbed
[49:17] and my mother didn't know what to say
[49:19] because she had a soul tie with this man
[49:22] who beat nearly beat the life out of her
[49:25] she was connected in a sick
[49:28] sick way
[49:30] and she couldn't get free
[49:33] and she didn't know what to say so we
[49:36] got in the vehicle
[49:39] and I thought we were heading back to
[49:40] the apartment
[49:42] for him to meet us there after work I
[49:44] thought we were going back
[49:47] and I remember thinking well I'll have
[49:49] my toys I'll have my you know I'll have
[49:51] my things
[49:53] and all of a sudden I looked up and read
[49:56] the sign
[49:58] and realized that we were not going back
[50:01] to Brunswick we were on our way to
[50:04] Columbus
[50:06] so I had not seen my grandmother in in
[50:09] but once in a couple of years now
[50:12] your dad's mom my dad's mom and and my
[50:15] mom's mom they flew me home one time but
[50:19] because my dad had had was working at
[50:23] Delta and and could and and they had us
[50:25] had a a caretaker whatever somebody
[50:28] watching over me help me I flew home One
[50:30] Time by myself at four years old nearly
[50:34] five can you imagine
[50:35] you couldn't do that today no I wouldn't
[50:38] want to I wouldn't I wouldn't have let
[50:39] you all do it and and visited with my
[50:42] family but but I was so glad I was so
[50:44] glad to see my Baptist granny my
[50:46] mother's mother and my Pentecostal
[50:48] granny my dad's mother and and the
[50:50] promise of being in service
[50:53] and uh do you want me to tell you about
[50:55] the Holy Ghost not or do you want to are
[50:57] you talking about when when God yes
[51:00] because that's a pretty cool story in my
[51:01] opinion because you're on your way to
[51:04] church and you told your granny that you
[51:06] weren't the Holy Ghost and she said do
[51:09] you want more than a new bike and you
[51:11] and in the book you said I thought about
[51:13] it for a minute and I said I sure do I
[51:14] was still five and then you said well
[51:17] actually I was seven by this time and
[51:19] then she said well do you want it more
[51:20] than a new pony
[51:22] and yeah and and uh but make sure when
[51:25] you tell the story tell the part about
[51:27] your grandfather too about how he
[51:28] thought there was something wrong with
[51:30] you okay all right I will
[51:33] um yeah I was I was just about to be
[51:36] seven or right at seven now we had been
[51:38] home a little while mother had gotten
[51:40] her job back at the bank and life was
[51:43] pretty good and I I've never told you
[51:46] this but uh in those two years there was
[51:50] a time
[51:52] uh we lived with her mother for a while
[51:55] my grandmother
[51:57] uh and then we bought them we we rented
[52:01] an apartment and she come and live with
[52:02] us so it was my mother and I and my and
[52:06] her mother my grandmother
[52:08] uh Miss Ellis
[52:10] and there was one time in that two-year
[52:13] period that Jerry came looking for us
[52:16] and took my mother off come there I I
[52:21] think I may be the one to open the door
[52:22] and I nearly passed out a knock come on
[52:25] the door of the apartment I opened the
[52:26] door and there he stood
[52:28] and and I have to tell you like I said I
[52:30] didn't hate him in fact I loved him
[52:33] I I guess that sounds crazy
[52:35] but I did I loved him
[52:37] I wasn't glad to see him
[52:39] because I knew that he was going to be
[52:42] on his best behavior he was going to
[52:44] promise my mother the world and you said
[52:46] that in the book you said before they
[52:47] even got married that he was the
[52:49] sweetest he treated her and it was
[52:52] almost like the dad that you never had
[52:53] he was a little younger a few years
[52:55] younger than than she was I don't
[52:57] remember how many years but he was good
[52:59] to us and and uh you know he would take
[53:03] me to the park and we flew Kites and
[53:06] really for a short period of time six
[53:09] months or so uh you know he did things
[53:13] with me that a dad would do with their
[53:14] son and and so this change this real
[53:18] real a person that that came out his
[53:22] anger uh
[53:24] sits
[53:26] I've never seen anybody since with this
[53:29] kind of anger uh in that moment it's
[53:32] only the grace of God I know that he
[53:35] didn't kill my mother or me
[53:38] because he was so angry he did not beat
[53:40] me by the way
[53:42] uh which is really kind of a miracle
[53:44] because I jumped on him
[53:47] you know maybe this isn't the place to
[53:48] talk about that but I mean I jumped on
[53:50] his back more than one time beating him
[53:53] in the head with both fists to try to
[53:55] get him to move the butcher knife from
[53:57] my mother's neck
[53:59] and so he could have easily
[54:01] uh hurt me but for some reason he didn't
[54:05] well he come there to the door in that
[54:07] two-year period from five to seven I
[54:10] don't remember exactly when it was and I
[54:12] asked my mother to go off and my my
[54:15] grandmother her little short mother said
[54:18] Jane you're crazy I'd never heard her
[54:21] talk to my mom like that you are crazy
[54:24] what you've been through I wouldn't
[54:27] drink a milkshake with that man
[54:30] but she went out on a date
[54:32] and uh
[54:34] and she told us before she left that she
[54:37] was thinking about uh going back to live
[54:39] with him and I told her then I'll never
[54:42] go with you
[54:43] I'll never go with you I'll stay with my
[54:46] memo we'll go somewhere we'll do
[54:48] whatever we have to do but I'll never go
[54:49] with you and I remember this she went
[54:52] out on that date she was going three or
[54:54] four hours
[54:55] my I remember getting down by my bed and
[54:58] praying and calling on the Lord and I
[55:01] remember my little Baptist granny coming
[55:03] down that long hallway to my bedroom in
[55:05] the apartment and standing there and
[55:07] praying with me and her I could see her
[55:09] chin quivering
[55:11] as she was so broken and we cried out
[55:14] for my mother's soul and for her life
[55:16] and when she come home that night what
[55:19] kind of time did you have had a had a
[55:21] wonderful time but I'm I'm I need to
[55:23] tell you all I'm not going back I'm not
[55:25] going back to him
[55:27] God had heard our prayer and she never
[55:30] did
[55:30] now uh so we our life settled down a
[55:34] little bit after that we were living in
[55:36] Columbus I was in school I was in a
[55:39] gifted program in school that was really
[55:41] challenging my my brain power and and I
[55:45] was feeling good and I was able to go to
[55:48] church
[55:49] and uh sometimes I to the Pentecostal
[55:53] church not to the Baptist Church the
[55:55] problem was if my mother was mad at me
[55:58] or if I did something wrong the way she
[56:00] punished me was not letting me go to
[56:02] church
[56:03] and and I don't know but that doesn't
[56:05] seem like the right way to punish a
[56:06] child that wants to go to church but but
[56:09] she it's all she could use on me because
[56:11] there's something you cared about that
[56:12] was all she could use on me because I
[56:14] didn't care anything about sports I
[56:16] didn't care anything about anything else
[56:18] except school and church I lived for it
[56:21] I loved school and lived for church well
[56:25] anyway you're right we're driving on the
[56:27] way to church
[56:29] that night again a Saturday night
[56:33] and
[56:35] my grandma I told my grandmother I want
[56:37] to be filled with a Holy Ghost
[56:40] I said to her big mama
[56:43] I don't think the Lord must want me to
[56:46] have the Holy Ghost
[56:48] she about wrecked the car
[56:50] she put that big old arm across the seat
[56:54] and and she said what do you mean he
[56:57] don't want you to have the Holy Ghost I
[56:59] tell you right now he does
[57:02] and she said here's the question it's
[57:04] you it's not him
[57:06] she didn't like it that I was
[57:08] insinuating that the Lord didn't want me
[57:10] to have it she knew where the problem
[57:12] was it was with me and she said uh
[57:17] if you do you want the Holy Ghost more
[57:20] than a new bicycle
[57:22] I had to think about it I had an old
[57:23] beat up raggedy bike
[57:26] and uh because mother was Raising Me On
[57:29] One income
[57:31] and uh yes ma'am I want it more than I
[57:34] want a new bike a new pony and she
[57:36] listed several things
[57:38] but I did because I wanted more of
[57:42] whatever that was I had experienced when
[57:44] I met the Lord at three
[57:47] I wanted more of it
[57:49] and uh I invited the Lord really I mean
[57:53] I I feel like that I feel like the
[57:57] experience that I had of of 18 months
[58:00] old I really believe that's
[58:03] between that and and and having the
[58:06] visitation of the Lord at three
[58:08] uh it's one I just give my heart to him
[58:12] and and so I feel like that was my the
[58:14] beginning of my born-again experience
[58:16] but I needed the Holy Ghost I wanted it
[58:19] him
[58:20] and so my granny said well you never
[58:22] know she said you may get it tonight
[58:26] if we pray you may get it tonight well
[58:29] we got to church and there was a group
[58:31] of of Italian people there I remember
[58:33] him very well beautiful singers and we
[58:37] had a church full and and I couldn't
[58:39] enjoy the congregational singing I
[58:41] couldn't enjoy the special singing
[58:43] because I felt so heavy I wanted the
[58:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't even
[58:49] know Joshua if I fully knew what he was
[58:51] what it meant you just knew you wanted I
[58:54] just knew I wanted him
[58:56] and so I got down by by the altar bench
[59:00] by the by the Pew there
[59:03] in the front of the church
[59:05] and I have the altar bench where God met
[59:08] me I have the ultra bench where my
[59:09] grandmother received the baptism of the
[59:12] Holy Ghost
[59:13] and in 1950
[59:16] but anyway I knelt there and and I began
[59:19] to pray
[59:20] and I felt my inner man I don't know how
[59:25] to describe it I could probably describe
[59:27] it better now than then leaving my body
[59:31] three times to make a long story shorter
[59:35] three times I felt like something on the
[59:38] inside of me being pulled out of my
[59:39] physical body and I remember being up at
[59:42] the like in the rafters of the church
[59:44] and looking down and seeing myself down
[59:47] there praying for the Holy Ghost
[59:51] I know this is wonderful you know and I
[59:53] began to hear off in the distance a
[59:55] language that I had never heard before
[59:58] and I wanted that language I knew
[1:00:01] somehow it was mine that I would speak
[1:00:04] that language sounds a little strange
[1:00:07] but I knew that was my language and I
[1:00:10] would speak that language but when I
[1:00:12] started focusing on that language
[1:00:15] instead of my desire for him I went back
[1:00:18] into my body I felt myself coming back
[1:00:20] down and I could for a few minutes
[1:00:23] recognize what was going on around me
[1:00:25] and then again he would pull me out
[1:00:27] three times I felt pulled out of my body
[1:00:30] and each time heard the language
[1:00:34] but it wasn't until I started kind of
[1:00:36] focusing on that language that I came
[1:00:38] back in so the Lord was teaching me and
[1:00:40] I didn't even know what what I was being
[1:00:42] taught until until later
[1:00:44] he was teaching me that it's not about
[1:00:46] speaking in tongues it's not about a
[1:00:49] feeling it is truly about him
[1:00:53] and each person has a you know is going
[1:00:55] to have their own unique
[1:00:57] way and and you know it's not like you
[1:00:59] said in the book too it's not just about
[1:01:00] speaking in the tongues each person will
[1:01:03] know when they have it yes by the
[1:01:05] knowing yes by the knowing and and and
[1:01:07] it won't be like mine my experience of
[1:01:10] receiving the Holy Ghost won't be like
[1:01:12] your experience of receiving the Holy
[1:01:14] Ghost and this is where we make a big
[1:01:15] mistake is we look at someone else's
[1:01:18] testimony and we think oh that's how I
[1:01:21] want it
[1:01:22] uh and and we focus on that and we miss
[1:01:26] it remind me to tell you about my
[1:01:27] grandmother receiving the Holy Ghost all
[1:01:29] right because it's kind of a story like
[1:01:30] that where she got to focusing on the
[1:01:33] wrong thing and it hindered her from
[1:01:35] getting it uh you should not hear
[1:01:38] somebody's testimony and they oh you
[1:01:40] know God must love them more than he
[1:01:42] loves me oh it's not about that okay I
[1:01:45] mean everybody's like I said everybody's
[1:01:46] gonna be completely different you see
[1:01:48] God knows you just like he knew me and
[1:01:50] he knew what it would take for a
[1:01:52] seven-year-old
[1:01:54] to get it to receive it to believe it to
[1:01:58] be able to yield to it
[1:02:00] and he knows at your age at everybody
[1:02:02] else's age who however old you are if
[1:02:05] you've not received the baptism of the
[1:02:07] Holy Ghost you don't have to receive it
[1:02:09] like me but you need to receive him
[1:02:12] because it's the finishing of the
[1:02:14] born-again experience I truly believe
[1:02:18] and will be criticized for saying that
[1:02:21] you are not fully born again until you
[1:02:24] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:27] you've got to have that birth that comes
[1:02:31] by the Holy Ghost but don't ever think
[1:02:33] that because someone received it one way
[1:02:35] a a grander way or more exciting way
[1:02:39] that God loves them more than he loves
[1:02:41] you or or anything like that there's no
[1:02:45] truce to that at all but he filled me oh
[1:02:48] he filled me with the Holy Ghost I spoke
[1:02:52] in tongues that third time that I came
[1:02:55] down to myself I remember taking my hand
[1:02:59] and putting it up over my mouth and
[1:03:02] realizing it was my lips I had been
[1:03:05] speaking that language the whole time
[1:03:07] but I was unaware of it that was not to
[1:03:10] be the focus
[1:03:12] uh I do not believe that someone has the
[1:03:15] Holy Ghost because they talked in
[1:03:17] tongues I really don't I believe it can
[1:03:20] be counterfeited I believe it can be
[1:03:22] imitated and I don't think that we need
[1:03:25] to to to let that be our criteria we
[1:03:28] need to live a life surrender to the
[1:03:30] word of God and we can only do that when
[1:03:33] we have the genuine baptism of the Holy
[1:03:35] Ghost however there's no devil in hell
[1:03:38] and no preacher in the Pulpit that's
[1:03:42] going to talk me out of what God did for
[1:03:45] me he give me a such a knowing because I
[1:03:49] was your knowing that was mine that's
[1:03:51] what I needed and so the devil has said
[1:03:54] all kinds of things to me in my mind
[1:03:56] Through The Years you're a this and
[1:03:59] you're that and you're not this and
[1:04:01] you're not the other but I tell you what
[1:04:03] he doesn't tell me he doesn't tell me
[1:04:06] that I don't have the baptism of the
[1:04:07] Holy Ghost because if he did he knows
[1:04:11] what I would tell him you
[1:04:12] liar I was there when it happened and I
[1:04:16] guess I ought to know and everybody's
[1:04:19] got to have that kind whatever it takes
[1:04:21] you've got to have that kind of faith
[1:04:24] and that kind of an experience so that
[1:04:26] you will not let the devil talk you out
[1:04:28] of it
[1:04:29] and so I ran I danced I jumped I rolled
[1:04:34] I shouted I probably beat my head on the
[1:04:37] wall I was wild I confess I'm not
[1:04:40] ashamed
[1:04:42] my life had been revolutionized as a
[1:04:45] seven-year-old boy
[1:04:47] and uh would never be the same and
[1:04:50] because of that I would not drink
[1:04:52] I would not smoke
[1:04:54] I wouldn't I wouldn't commit fornication
[1:04:57] so what I'm telling you is God filled me
[1:05:00] with a holy ghost at seven because he
[1:05:02] wanted to preserve my life
[1:05:05] I could have ended up because of the
[1:05:08] rejection of my father because of
[1:05:11] watching my mother suffer and the abuse
[1:05:13] and the bitterness that could have
[1:05:15] boiled in my life and the hatred that
[1:05:17] could have boiled in my life I could
[1:05:19] have become violent I could have been a
[1:05:21] drug addict I had seen enough drugs my
[1:05:25] mother had drugs my mother drank alcohol
[1:05:28] both husbands had problems I could have
[1:05:31] easily gone that way but because he
[1:05:35] filled me with this real Holy Ghost he
[1:05:39] gave me the strength and if there was a
[1:05:41] Temptation that came and they did come
[1:05:43] at times if there was a Temptation that
[1:05:46] came I just I just went back to what he
[1:05:48] had done for me Lord I could never
[1:05:49] betray you now I could never fail you
[1:05:51] now I've got to be true to what you did
[1:05:54] for me he claimed me
[1:05:56] when he filled me with the Holy Ghost he
[1:05:58] come to claim the call that he had
[1:06:01] placed on my life and I knew from I mean
[1:06:03] I knew from three I told every every
[1:06:06] person from three I'm a preacher
[1:06:09] but at seven I surrendered to the call
[1:06:12] and it was shortly thereafter shortly
[1:06:15] after receiving the holy ghost that I
[1:06:17] preached my first sermon
[1:06:19] now let me tell you real quick about my
[1:06:21] granny big mama it's what I called her
[1:06:23] her name was Mildred Shelley let me tell
[1:06:27] you real quick about her getting the
[1:06:28] Holy Ghost if we have time yeah oh yeah
[1:06:31] okay
[1:06:32] she was uh raised with with uh 15
[1:06:37] brothers and sisters
[1:06:40] and her mother and father were
[1:06:42] sharecroppers
[1:06:45] and uh her dad died at an early age
[1:06:49] and her mother was was the one who kept
[1:06:53] the sharecrop contract
[1:06:56] in other words she continued to do the
[1:06:59] work of a man
[1:07:01] to keep her a children in a house
[1:07:05] with food to eat
[1:07:07] uh uh a a sharecropper was someone who
[1:07:11] lived in a small house
[1:07:13] on someone else's property and they
[1:07:15] worked the property
[1:07:17] and the the food the produce belonged to
[1:07:21] the owner but as part of the wages you
[1:07:24] got the place to live and you got food
[1:07:26] on the table
[1:07:27] and so my great-grandmother
[1:07:31] my great-grandmother Lizzy
[1:07:33] she couldn't afford to raise all these
[1:07:36] children some of them were grown by by
[1:07:38] the time her husband died
[1:07:41] and his name was Levy it was spelled
[1:07:44] Levi but they called him Levy
[1:07:47] and Wilkerson and and and by the time he
[1:07:51] passed away she had to plow the field
[1:07:53] and she carried 100 pound sacks of what
[1:07:57] they called Joanna fertilizer on her
[1:07:59] back
[1:08:00] and plowed the mules and plowed the
[1:08:03] horses in the field to keep food on the
[1:08:06] table and to keep a bed a roof over
[1:08:08] their head in the bed to sleep in
[1:08:10] and they didn't know anything about
[1:08:12] about serving the lord
[1:08:15] they were were Heathen people
[1:08:19] and uh I'll tell you another time how
[1:08:23] how my great granny got the whole how
[1:08:25] all these things happened to them but uh
[1:08:28] another another time together but let me
[1:08:30] tell you about about big mama how she
[1:08:33] got it they moved she grew up she
[1:08:36] married my grandfather they moved from
[1:08:38] from La lower Alabama up to Columbus
[1:08:41] Georgia because that's where the jobs
[1:08:43] were in the cotton Mills she worked in
[1:08:46] the cotton meal he worked at the cotton
[1:08:48] mill
[1:08:48] and everybody in Columbus Georgia at the
[1:08:51] time worked in the cotton mill either
[1:08:53] Hosiery meals or denim we had a big
[1:08:56] denim Factory here too
[1:08:59] and that's where people were coming they
[1:09:00] were leaving the farms and they were
[1:09:02] coming here to work in the cotton Mills
[1:09:04] and so they came and my grandmother knew
[1:09:08] very little about serving the lord but
[1:09:10] she began to cry for her family she
[1:09:13] wasn't even really born again
[1:09:15] but a burden began to fall on her for
[1:09:17] her family that were lost that didn't
[1:09:19] know nothing about Jesus and she began
[1:09:22] to learn from her neighbors things about
[1:09:24] the Lord
[1:09:26] she was sitting on her front porch after
[1:09:28] a shift at the cotton mill
[1:09:31] and she was eating popcorn
[1:09:34] and drinking sweet iced tea with milk in
[1:09:38] it
[1:09:39] and a little lady walked up on the porch
[1:09:44] her name was Sister Alice Flanagan
[1:09:48] her husband was Reverend b w Flanagan
[1:09:52] who pastored the Assembly of God Church
[1:09:54] in Columbus
[1:09:56] Trinity Temple now but in those days it
[1:09:59] was called Bellwood Assembly of God
[1:10:01] she walked up on the front porch she
[1:10:04] said my name is Sister Flanagan and I
[1:10:07] want to invite you to church
[1:10:09] and my grandmother burst out in tears
[1:10:12] how old would she have been well she was
[1:10:14] she had children
[1:10:15] so I guess she was in her
[1:10:17] early well let me think just a minute
[1:10:20] she was born in the in the late 30s
[1:10:24] of 45th 1950 this was 1950 when this
[1:10:28] happened about 1949 or 1950 so
[1:10:33] she was in in her late 20s
[1:10:36] is that right
[1:10:38] or early 30s late 20s early 30s I think
[1:10:42] or I think it would have been early 30s
[1:10:45] she burst out in tears and sister
[1:10:47] Flanagan said oh honey what did I do she
[1:10:50] said not a thing
[1:10:52] I just realized that you were the first
[1:10:55] person that has ever invited me to
[1:10:57] church
[1:10:58] that really gets me
[1:11:01] to be that old already have children and
[1:11:04] nobody ever invites you to church
[1:11:07] and she said I sure will come
[1:11:10] and sister Flanigan just went right down
[1:11:13] Neil Drive asking everybody to come to
[1:11:15] church and they came
[1:11:18] and the first night my granny went
[1:11:23] it was 49 because she was ordained in
[1:11:26] 50. so it had to be 1949.
[1:11:29] this was way back then really if you
[1:11:31] think about it that's a long time ago
[1:11:33] she went into church and she'd never
[1:11:35] seen anything like it in her life
[1:11:37] she was like my mother was when she went
[1:11:39] to the Pentecostal Church the first time
[1:11:41] they were dancing and singing and she
[1:11:43] said every one of them looked like they
[1:11:44] had a light bulb in their head because
[1:11:46] the light she said there was so much
[1:11:48] light coming out of them
[1:11:51] she'd never seen happy people all she
[1:11:54] ever knew was hard work and miserable
[1:11:58] people
[1:11:59] just getting by no joy in life and she
[1:12:03] said these were the happiest people
[1:12:05] she'd ever seen in all of her life
[1:12:07] and she said
[1:12:09] they begin to have a a worship singing
[1:12:12] shouting dancing and they begin to have
[1:12:15] what they called a Jericho March well
[1:12:17] she thought she was somebody you know my
[1:12:19] grand she was from the farm but had
[1:12:21] moved to the city she was just an old
[1:12:24] country girl at heart but she thought
[1:12:26] you know I've got a good job and I've
[1:12:28] got a nice house there on Neil drive and
[1:12:31] and and and and I don't know if I want
[1:12:33] to carry on like this or not she didn't
[1:12:35] even know what it all was
[1:12:37] they begin to have a Jericho March and
[1:12:39] March around the church clapping and
[1:12:41] they wanted her to go with him in the
[1:12:43] Jericho March well she didn't even know
[1:12:45] what it was but she said it couldn't
[1:12:46] couldn't hurt nothing
[1:12:48] marching around the church Clapping Your
[1:12:50] Hands saying praise the Lord every now
[1:12:51] and again she thought she could do that
[1:12:53] so she got up and started doing it and
[1:12:56] an old sister hit her on the shoulder
[1:12:57] and said you'll get it tonight
[1:13:01] and she said I didn't know what I would
[1:13:03] get
[1:13:04] she said I had no idea what they were
[1:13:08] talking about get what what am I going
[1:13:10] to get tonight
[1:13:11] and she said I just said well all right
[1:13:13] then and she said I just kept marching
[1:13:15] around with them and finally she said I
[1:13:18] looked down at the altar and there was
[1:13:21] my neighbor Mrs Havens Carter
[1:13:26] I grew up calling her my aunt Haven
[1:13:29] but she wasn't my aunt but that's how
[1:13:32] how close our families were
[1:13:34] and
[1:13:36] she lived right next door to my
[1:13:38] grandmother
[1:13:39] and she did hair ladies hair
[1:13:43] for her living had a little beauty shop
[1:13:45] in in the side of the house
[1:13:48] and my grandmother was so shocked
[1:13:50] because she knew Havens and she knew she
[1:13:53] wasn't a church-going girl yet
[1:13:56] and there she was on her knees my granny
[1:14:00] said in the altar she said she had her
[1:14:03] hands lifted up like this tears running
[1:14:06] down her face
[1:14:08] more beautiful than I had ever seen her
[1:14:11] she said and she was speaking the most
[1:14:14] beautiful language she said I have never
[1:14:17] heard a language like that and she said
[1:14:22] is that what they were telling me I
[1:14:24] would get tonight if it is I want to get
[1:14:27] it just like that
[1:14:29] she said I'd never seen her look so
[1:14:31] beautiful just kneeling down there
[1:14:33] reverently
[1:14:35] getting this encounter with God
[1:14:38] and she said I got to focus in on that I
[1:14:41] said Lord I guess I'm gonna have to stop
[1:14:42] and kneel down one of these turns uh and
[1:14:46] and and pray to get whatever that is
[1:14:49] that Havens has God I can't leave here
[1:14:51] without it well she did get the Holy
[1:14:54] Ghost
[1:14:55] but that was much further in the service
[1:14:58] and she didn't get it kneeling down in
[1:15:02] the altar looking beautiful
[1:15:04] like Havens
[1:15:05] My grandmother used to say Steve her
[1:15:08] there wasn't a wrinkle in her dress she
[1:15:10] was just sit just kneeling there like
[1:15:13] this just under the power of God
[1:15:16] she said but I didn't get it that way
[1:15:17] she said I they prayed for me to get the
[1:15:20] Holy Ghost and I ran and I hollered and
[1:15:24] I jumped and I rolled and I laughed and
[1:15:28] I screamed
[1:15:29] and God filled me with the Holy Ghost
[1:15:32] and Fire
[1:15:34] and changed her life 1949.
[1:15:38] by 1950 she had surrendered to whatever
[1:15:42] whatever she was going to do for the
[1:15:44] Lord
[1:15:45] and so my point in all that was you know
[1:15:49] you can't choose how you receive the
[1:15:51] Holy Ghost and and like we were saying
[1:15:52] earlier no two is going to be the same
[1:15:54] you know brother Branham a great servant
[1:15:57] of God a real genuine prophet of God who
[1:16:01] lived a generation ago
[1:16:03] he used to say any birth is a mess
[1:16:08] it doesn't matter whether it happens in
[1:16:10] a beautifully pink or sterile Hospital
[1:16:13] Suite or in a barnyard a birth is a mess
[1:16:18] there's going to be blood there's going
[1:16:20] to be there's going to be water there's
[1:16:21] going to be snotting there's going to be
[1:16:24] carrying on
[1:16:25] and and that's what we've got to have
[1:16:28] son we've got to have a birth a new
[1:16:32] birth you don't have to run you don't
[1:16:35] have to talk in tongues you don't have
[1:16:37] to roll in the floor you don't have to
[1:16:38] jump Shout shake feel chills
[1:16:42] you don't have to do any of that but
[1:16:44] what you have got to do is you've got to
[1:16:47] have a birth
[1:16:48] you've got to have the Holy Ghost and
[1:16:50] Fire because without the Holy Ghost you
[1:16:53] you can't hold on in the world we're
[1:16:55] living in today there's too many things
[1:16:57] pulling us lying to us all the time
[1:17:00] so my my family because of my granny
[1:17:04] getting the Holy Ghost in 1949 she took
[1:17:07] the spirit of God
[1:17:08] to her whole family
[1:17:10] and her whole family including her
[1:17:12] mother was saved and filled with the
[1:17:15] Holy Ghost one Christmas Eve night which
[1:17:17] I will certainly tell you sometime if
[1:17:19] you'll have me by I'd love to tell this
[1:17:22] and and that's another thing is like
[1:17:25] I feel like you know when it all comes
[1:17:28] down to people can say well you don't
[1:17:29] have the Holy Ghost this person doesn't
[1:17:30] have the Holy but that's not their place
[1:17:32] to judge we better not be uh he's the
[1:17:34] kind of Judge as long as you know in
[1:17:36] your heart that you are filled with the
[1:17:37] Holy Ghost I don't think anybody can
[1:17:39] really take that away from you no and if
[1:17:41] you are filled the proof is going to be
[1:17:43] there in your life for sure the fruits
[1:17:45] of the spirit are going to be there and
[1:17:47] and and and and the The Obedience to the
[1:17:51] word is going to be there you you will
[1:17:53] begin to rearrange your thoughts to line
[1:17:57] up with the word when you receive the
[1:17:58] Holy Ghost and your your time doesn't
[1:18:01] belong to you anymore when you truly
[1:18:03] receive the baptism in the Holy Ghost
[1:18:05] you realize that your priorities change
[1:18:08] they must
[1:18:09] and what you love changes that the old
[1:18:12] timers used to say this they'd say when
[1:18:15] I got saved the things I once loved I
[1:18:18] now hated and the things I once hated I
[1:18:21] now loved I remember them also saying
[1:18:24] when I was a boy Joshua they used to say
[1:18:26] why when I got saved I didn't quit
[1:18:30] Dancing
[1:18:32] because in some of those denominational
[1:18:34] churches you know if you you could dance
[1:18:36] and and you couldn't go to dances or
[1:18:39] anything of course you couldn't in the
[1:18:41] Pentecostal church either but dancing
[1:18:43] was sinning but I would hear them
[1:18:45] Old-Timers say God say stand up and say
[1:18:48] oh no when I got saved and filled with
[1:18:52] the Holy Ghost I didn't quit Dancing I
[1:18:54] just changed partners
[1:18:56] I wasn't dancing for the world no more I
[1:18:58] was dancing for Jesus that's right it
[1:19:01] was real it's real he is real do you
[1:19:04] remember the first sermon you preached I
[1:19:06] do I remember the first sermon I know
[1:19:08] you said in the book you had everything
[1:19:09] like lined out on index cards and then
[1:19:11] you ended up getting rid of them and
[1:19:13] just letting the Lord take over I I
[1:19:15] remember calling my granny I go back
[1:19:17] further than that I remember calling my
[1:19:19] big mama and saying to her big mama I
[1:19:21] believe the Lord has given me my sermon
[1:19:24] it was always understood from the time I
[1:19:27] was three that I was going to be a
[1:19:28] preacher
[1:19:29] and I introduced myself as such
[1:19:32] and when I went one time with my Baptist
[1:19:35] granny
[1:19:36] to the Baptist Church
[1:19:38] and the pastor brother book was his name
[1:19:40] and he shook the congregation's hand at
[1:19:42] the end of the service and I looked
[1:19:43] right up at him just a little boy I look
[1:19:45] right up at him and I said I really like
[1:19:48] that song we sung this morning when the
[1:19:50] role is Called Up Yonder and I said I'm
[1:19:53] a preacher and I may have your job one
[1:19:56] day just a little boy
[1:19:58] I just identified as a preacher well but
[1:20:02] God began to deal with my heart that the
[1:20:04] time was drawing near and I was only
[1:20:06] seven I had just received the Holy Ghost
[1:20:10] but God began to deal with me and I had
[1:20:12] a different set of circumstances because
[1:20:14] Granny had the church and she saw my
[1:20:17] life she knew what God had done she knew
[1:20:20] the prophecies
[1:20:23] um
[1:20:24] you know I guess I should talk about
[1:20:26] real quick I should probably mention the
[1:20:29] confirmation of of the ministry that God
[1:20:31] gave through the little sister in the
[1:20:33] colds of fire do you want me yeah I was
[1:20:36] going to go to that story next but yeah
[1:20:37] go ahead before I before I go to my
[1:20:39] first sermon I probably should tell this
[1:20:41] but uh because the old church was uh it
[1:20:45] did have electricity it did have
[1:20:47] electric lights but it didn't have
[1:20:48] electric heat and later it had gas
[1:20:50] heaters but when when I was little it
[1:20:53] had wood stoves a line of them down the
[1:20:56] side the right hand side of the
[1:20:58] sanctuary a row against the wall of wood
[1:21:01] stoves and they had cooked surfaces on
[1:21:03] them because they had been cook stoves
[1:21:07] and um
[1:21:08] so they would get so hot each one of
[1:21:11] them had its own uh you know chimney or
[1:21:14] smokestack coming out of the back of it
[1:21:16] and and and it went straight up the wall
[1:21:18] and then into the wall and then and then
[1:21:21] into a hallway and then out of the top
[1:21:23] of the of the so it didn't smoke up the
[1:21:25] church
[1:21:26] and many times we would go in even with
[1:21:30] the indoor plumbing and the toilets
[1:21:32] would be froze solid and we'd have to
[1:21:34] thaw them out to use them because this
[1:21:36] was a I mean it had been a honky tonk
[1:21:39] and then the outhouse
[1:21:40] and so it wasn't fancy and and it was
[1:21:43] fixed up you know it looked pretty in
[1:21:45] there as a church but it it was still
[1:21:48] very primitive still wood floor and and
[1:21:50] uh and anyway uh those cook stoves were
[1:21:54] along the walls and somebody had to put
[1:21:56] the wood in and keep them fed the
[1:21:58] problem is because they weren't wood
[1:22:01] heaters they were wood stoves that had
[1:22:04] been used for cooking they had a cooked
[1:22:06] surface
[1:22:07] some of them a little bit larger than
[1:22:10] others and that what that is son is you
[1:22:13] just put your pot right on the the
[1:22:15] surface of the cook stove and cook
[1:22:17] whatever you were cooking boiling
[1:22:19] potatoes or fried chicken or whatever
[1:22:20] you were doing
[1:22:22] and that was just there dangerous oh my
[1:22:25] goodness we would go to jail today if we
[1:22:27] had cook stoves in here for children to
[1:22:29] get to
[1:22:30] but but nobody knew I mean I don't guess
[1:22:33] they even knew back then there were no
[1:22:35] fire inspections or anything well anyway
[1:22:36] it was dangerous because the whole top
[1:22:39] of that stove got hot and the stove pipe
[1:22:42] would get so hot that you it would look
[1:22:44] like that white heat would make it look
[1:22:46] like you could look right through the
[1:22:48] stove pipe you've probably never seen
[1:22:50] anything like that
[1:22:51] and so I've seen many times the Saints
[1:22:56] shout dance worship God and get around
[1:22:59] there behind them stoves around those
[1:23:01] cook stoves and and visitors would go
[1:23:04] crazy because they they were afraid they
[1:23:06] were going to hurt themselves
[1:23:08] and even I at times as a kid would look
[1:23:12] up and think oh my
[1:23:14] because I've seen men grab those stove
[1:23:17] pipes lost in the spirit of God tears
[1:23:21] running down their face and lay their
[1:23:23] bare cheek up against the stovepipe and
[1:23:26] not be burned now that's Supernatural
[1:23:29] that is Supernatural that don't happen
[1:23:31] in the natural
[1:23:32] and I saw more than one occasion someone
[1:23:35] sit right down you know dancing around
[1:23:38] jumping praising the Lord crying and sit
[1:23:40] right down on that surface of that cook
[1:23:42] stove and not be burned I grew up with a
[1:23:46] supernatural childhood to to see those
[1:23:48] things
[1:23:49] and only be 55 these things were you
[1:23:53] know in most places they they weren't
[1:23:54] happening like that in in 68. I guess
[1:23:57] you never got tired of that feeling
[1:23:59] though to see that
[1:24:01] I've never ever got got used to it or or
[1:24:06] it's not common to me and I want that
[1:24:09] presence I want to be in that kind of an
[1:24:11] atmosphere every chance I get
[1:24:14] so this particular night I had I had
[1:24:17] actually spoken that night I had given a
[1:24:19] little something so it must have been
[1:24:21] right after the preaching right after
[1:24:22] I'd started preaching I may have gotten
[1:24:25] that a little out of order because my or
[1:24:26] either I was reading a scripture or
[1:24:28] something but my Bible was on the pulpit
[1:24:30] that night I remember that very well
[1:24:32] and there was a little sister in our
[1:24:35] church
[1:24:36] uh uh who was uh was a hard-working she
[1:24:40] had a lot of children she worked in the
[1:24:42] cotton mill
[1:24:43] her husband was sometimes in church
[1:24:47] sometimes out of church she had a hard
[1:24:49] life
[1:24:52] she
[1:24:53] got in the spirit
[1:24:55] and she danced around that church she
[1:24:59] danced over around that stove that hot
[1:25:02] stove
[1:25:03] she sat down
[1:25:06] on the cook stove
[1:25:08] and I ran because I loved her so much
[1:25:13] I ran to see if I could help her get up
[1:25:15] stand up
[1:25:17] and to see if her dress was I thought
[1:25:20] the whole back end of her dress would be
[1:25:22] burned out
[1:25:23] because she sat there so long when I got
[1:25:26] around there to her to try to help her
[1:25:29] up she stood up
[1:25:31] before I could touch her and there was
[1:25:34] not one scorched place on the back of
[1:25:36] her dress that's Supernatural that can't
[1:25:40] happen you can't sit on a hot stove and
[1:25:44] not be burned
[1:25:47] she was there was not a skirt there was
[1:25:49] no smell of smoke nothing
[1:25:53] but what she did next will be very
[1:25:56] difficult for some people to believe
[1:25:59] and I can't say I don't care I care
[1:26:02] whether or not people believe it but
[1:26:04] whether they choose to believe it or not
[1:26:06] again is up to them I was there when it
[1:26:10] happened and I know what happened
[1:26:13] she reached over and unlatched
[1:26:17] the door
[1:26:18] where you fed the wood
[1:26:21] and I I thought I mean at that point I
[1:26:23] didn't know people were watching I mean
[1:26:26] some were still worshiping but a lot of
[1:26:28] people watch it'd be hard not to watch
[1:26:30] once you realize that this what was
[1:26:32] going on and I saw this Joshua with my
[1:26:35] own eyes God is my witness
[1:26:38] she reached in
[1:26:40] to that hot stove into those hot red
[1:26:46] coals
[1:26:49] of Fire
[1:26:50] and took two heaping handfuls
[1:26:54] of of red hot coals out of that fire I
[1:26:59] can just feel people now saying oh I
[1:27:01] just thought
[1:27:03] but you know the Bible says that he
[1:27:07] gives us power over all the powers of
[1:27:09] the enemy and he talks about the signs
[1:27:11] that follow the Believers they shall lay
[1:27:13] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:27:16] and it says if they drink any deadly
[1:27:18] thing it shall not harm them they shall
[1:27:20] take up the serpents and not be harmed
[1:27:22] and and and so forth and so to me this
[1:27:25] was an extension of that scripture
[1:27:28] she wasn't drinking poison but she was
[1:27:31] doing something extremely dangerous she
[1:27:34] was walking almost as though she were
[1:27:36] walking through the fire and not being
[1:27:39] burned
[1:27:40] she kept dancing and speaking in tongues
[1:27:43] carrying like this those two heaping
[1:27:46] handfuls of red hot colds she danced
[1:27:50] across the front of the church with
[1:27:51] those coats in her hand now I'm telling
[1:27:54] you people went crazy they did they
[1:27:56] worshiped God they ran they cried they
[1:27:59] pounded the floor they they we knew that
[1:28:02] we were in the presence of God we knew
[1:28:05] that something Supernatural was taking
[1:28:07] place no one wanted to miss what God was
[1:28:10] doing people were getting saved people
[1:28:12] backsliders were run into the altar I
[1:28:15] mean it was uh a lot going on I'm sure
[1:28:19] she danced across the front of the
[1:28:21] church and hesitated a moment because
[1:28:23] she was a very respectful little sister
[1:28:25] and she didn't just March up on the
[1:28:28] platform but she she just she just you
[1:28:32] know kind of made her way up onto the
[1:28:35] step she got up onto the platform and
[1:28:38] she danced over to the pulpit and she
[1:28:41] lay those burning hot coals of fire on
[1:28:45] my Bible and prophesied about my
[1:28:48] Ministry
[1:28:50] now
[1:28:52] it happened
[1:28:55] we didn't move those coals I just have
[1:28:58] to ask what they burned out on my Bible
[1:29:01] and and and not one page of that Bible
[1:29:05] was destroyed do you still have that
[1:29:06] rifle I do not have that Bible because
[1:29:09] that Bible was later buried in the pla
[1:29:13] in the foundation of the church in
[1:29:15] Columbus OH that you've told me that
[1:29:17] that's right I I wished I had it but it
[1:29:20] wasn't meant for me to have
[1:29:22] but we thought we would always be in
[1:29:24] Columbus I guess and not out here in the
[1:29:27] country and so that Bible is buried
[1:29:29] there in the floor uh in a box in the
[1:29:33] foundation in the slab I guess you
[1:29:35] should say of the church in Columbus but
[1:29:37] there was just a maybe just a little
[1:29:39] around the edges of the page you could
[1:29:42] see just a little discoloration not one
[1:29:45] word was unreadable
[1:29:48] not one page was burned through it just
[1:29:52] burned out that the coach just burned
[1:29:54] out on the Bible did it take like a long
[1:29:56] time it took quite a while it took the
[1:29:58] rest of the service before those coasts
[1:30:00] would turn gray and be burned out but by
[1:30:03] the time that was happening people were
[1:30:05] being healed
[1:30:07] I remember particularly a crippled man
[1:30:11] in a brace that was healed that night
[1:30:15] and many received the baptism of the
[1:30:18] Holy Ghost many received deliverances
[1:30:20] from demons the church just happened to
[1:30:22] be packed full that night and when I say
[1:30:25] Pack full 250 people or more maybe 300
[1:30:28] people
[1:30:30] and that was just another confirmation
[1:30:33] that that my Ministry was going to be uh
[1:30:37] what God said it was going to be doesn't
[1:30:40] make me any more special than anybody
[1:30:42] else it just means that God because I
[1:30:45] was so young and look everybody didn't
[1:30:48] think that was a great idea for a
[1:30:50] seven-year-old to preach
[1:30:52] there were some people in the church who
[1:30:55] called me a novice and who said the
[1:30:56] Bible said a novice shouldn't shouldn't
[1:30:59] have a position in the church like that
[1:31:02] and here's what my granny said when I
[1:31:05] called her to tell her I wanted to
[1:31:06] preach she said well that's wonderful
[1:31:07] she said we're already having a service
[1:31:09] that Saturday night uh we're going to
[1:31:11] have some singers to sing you come and
[1:31:13] bring bring a message and then you
[1:31:15] preach for me Sunday morning and we're
[1:31:17] going to have a baptism in the afternoon
[1:31:19] and
[1:31:22] she didn't hesitate at all
[1:31:24] I started preparing my thoughts I wrote
[1:31:27] everything down on
[1:31:29] index cards
[1:31:31] and was ready to preach by a little
[1:31:34] Baptist granny came down the hallway and
[1:31:37] she said Steve do you want mammal to
[1:31:39] help you get your sermon
[1:31:41] I said I don't know mamaw but I think
[1:31:43] I'm supposed to get it from the Lord
[1:31:45] and she said well all right I'll do what
[1:31:48] I can and back down the hallway she went
[1:31:50] I heard her when she dropped down on her
[1:31:53] knees I heard her knees hit the floor I
[1:31:55] heard her begin to help him Lord oh help
[1:31:58] him Lord you give him what he needs to
[1:32:00] say
[1:32:01] I had it all wrote down and in fact I
[1:32:03] wrote down uh on the last card let us
[1:32:06] bow our head I had my altar call wrote
[1:32:09] down
[1:32:10] my grandmother got up in church that
[1:32:14] that Sunday
[1:32:17] because that night I don't even think I
[1:32:19] spoke that night I think it was a Sunday
[1:32:21] before I actually spoke
[1:32:23] she got up and she said now listen she
[1:32:26] said Steve has not had an ordinary life
[1:32:29] you people know how many of you here and
[1:32:31] know my grandson and everybody in the
[1:32:35] room
[1:32:36] knew me you have met in your life a
[1:32:39] couple of people who were there that day
[1:32:41] one of them particularly sister Lucy
[1:32:44] Huckabee she was in the service you see
[1:32:47] what always tell me walking out I was
[1:32:48] there and your dad preached his first
[1:32:50] message she's with the Lord now but she
[1:32:52] was very proud she sure was of me and
[1:32:56] love me very much and she was so happy
[1:32:58] to have been there at the beginning the
[1:33:00] first because she didn't come to our
[1:33:02] church
[1:33:03] she was in another church in Phoenix
[1:33:05] City but that morning she was drawn to
[1:33:08] be there and she was so happy to be
[1:33:10] there for that first sermon well anyway
[1:33:12] my granny got up she said you know him
[1:33:14] you know he's had an unusual life you
[1:33:16] know he doesn't he didn't grow up like a
[1:33:18] lot of other kids he hasn't gone into
[1:33:20] the world like a lot of people he's just
[1:33:22] seven years old
[1:33:24] she said from from before he was born
[1:33:28] God's hand was on him you heard the
[1:33:31] prophecy
[1:33:32] she pointed to the sister who gave the
[1:33:34] prophecy
[1:33:35] you've heard you've seen what God did
[1:33:38] you've seen how God used him to pray for
[1:33:40] the sick already
[1:33:42] and how God has healed them
[1:33:44] and she said I don't know what he will
[1:33:47] do I don't know what his sermon will be
[1:33:50] but she said I want you to know one
[1:33:52] thing his granny he'll be right here to
[1:33:55] back him up
[1:33:57] she said if he doesn't preach but five
[1:33:58] or ten minutes I'll be right here to
[1:34:00] back him up
[1:34:01] I think the book says you ended up
[1:34:03] preaching like 45 minutes 45 minutes
[1:34:06] uh but her
[1:34:08] such strong support because she was so
[1:34:12] respected
[1:34:13] so respected and her strong and
[1:34:16] staunched support for me
[1:34:18] could have been judged as a grandmother
[1:34:20] but people knew her better than that
[1:34:23] they knew that she didn't make provision
[1:34:25] for her family
[1:34:27] if they did wrong she called them out
[1:34:30] and so it meant something it paved the
[1:34:33] way now I was too short to see over the
[1:34:37] pulpit
[1:34:38] and so they took the altar that's
[1:34:41] down there at the office that my
[1:34:43] grandmother got the Holy Ghost on they
[1:34:45] took that altar bench and they took the
[1:34:47] piano stool and that's at our house
[1:34:50] and they put the piano stool on top of
[1:34:53] the altar bench
[1:34:55] and that was just the right height for
[1:34:57] me to see over
[1:34:59] and I and I preached I opened up my
[1:35:01] little bible I had an award Bible a gift
[1:35:03] and award Bible uh you used to could get
[1:35:06] them for four dollars and I don't know
[1:35:08] what they were even further back then
[1:35:09] just a little simple Bible that they
[1:35:11] give away in Sunday school was I didn't
[1:35:13] have a study Bible
[1:35:15] but I had all my index cards and I got
[1:35:17] up and I began to try to read those
[1:35:19] cards and Joshua there was an oil there
[1:35:22] was a warm sensation that came all over
[1:35:26] me
[1:35:27] it was just like somebody was pouring
[1:35:30] hot oil on my head and I could feel it
[1:35:33] as it come dripping down and I
[1:35:35] remembered in that moment
[1:35:37] I remembered one of the things that
[1:35:39] Jesus said to me when I was three years
[1:35:41] old in that visitation if you open your
[1:35:44] mouth remember if you open your mouth I
[1:35:47] will fill it
[1:35:50] and so I just yielded
[1:35:53] to that anointing that's what that oil
[1:35:55] was that was the everybody doesn't feel
[1:35:58] it that way I haven't always felt it
[1:36:00] that way I'm not putting anything in
[1:36:02] that
[1:36:03] but I did that day
[1:36:05] and I began to preach with an unction
[1:36:08] from the Lord I don't want to sound I'm
[1:36:11] sure that it was simple
[1:36:14] a must have been very simple
[1:36:17] we've actually played in church here at
[1:36:21] some of my anniversaries and things
[1:36:22] we've played a few excerpts of when I
[1:36:24] was about nine or ten really preaching
[1:36:27] yeah I remember that and and I've got
[1:36:29] one of the first on a cassette tape that
[1:36:32] we have used a little pieces of it
[1:36:35] and we'll dig those out because uh in in
[1:36:40] a couple of years I'll have a 50th
[1:36:42] anniversary of preaching 50 years I'll
[1:36:45] be I'll be 55 soon and in two years if
[1:36:48] Jesus dairies I'll be 57 and and we will
[1:36:50] have a an anniversary 50 years and we'll
[1:36:53] we'll try to bring some of those things
[1:36:55] out again
[1:36:56] but it was anointed it was him it God
[1:37:00] honored it there were people saved
[1:37:02] there were people filled with the Holy
[1:37:04] Ghost
[1:37:06] and we went to the to the creek and we
[1:37:09] baptized after the service and that
[1:37:12] night we came back and talked about
[1:37:14] church I thought we'd had church that
[1:37:16] morning that night you couldn't have put
[1:37:19] another person in the building the word
[1:37:20] had gotten all over Columbus there was
[1:37:22] no Facebook there was no Twitter there
[1:37:24] was no Instagram there was no cell phone
[1:37:27] there was no no way of getting out
[1:37:29] getting the word out it it had gone by
[1:37:32] the morning and now about six o'clock in
[1:37:34] the afternoon
[1:37:36] from 10 in the morning church out about
[1:37:38] one and now six o'clock and you couldn't
[1:37:41] have put another person on the floor
[1:37:42] they were it was that packed out I had
[1:37:44] to laugh because I was reading uh last
[1:37:46] night reading the book and uh your
[1:37:48] granny I guess you preached an hour and
[1:37:50] a half that's nice that's right she came
[1:37:53] up to you said it's now Steve that's a
[1:37:54] little long she did and I had to laugh
[1:37:56] because I was like what would she say
[1:37:57] now
[1:38:03] it depends well I do I do because I I do
[1:38:07] I do I do I can't deny it she said uh
[1:38:11] she said uh honey that was glorious she
[1:38:14] said that that service and all those
[1:38:16] people that got help from the Lord but
[1:38:18] she said the pre that that hour and a
[1:38:20] half she said that's a little bit too
[1:38:21] long
[1:38:22] um old brother Ward let me tell you this
[1:38:24] O Brother Ward he's gone on too he was a
[1:38:26] pastor here in town he used to come
[1:38:28] around and help me in the early days and
[1:38:30] be a blessing and he'd say little Stevie
[1:38:32] I want to tell you something yes sir
[1:38:35] brother Ward he'd say the the mind will
[1:38:38] only comprehend what the seat will
[1:38:42] endure
[1:38:44] so in other words after you're numb you
[1:38:47] can't pay attention as much that's funny
[1:38:49] I had never heard that yep
[1:38:51] um now how old were you when you ended
[1:38:53] up moving to Anderson well uh between
[1:38:58] then uh when I was because that's where
[1:39:01] you started your own your first church
[1:39:03] right right now I was in a I was
[1:39:06] preaching a Revival up in the valley
[1:39:07] when I was about 15.
[1:39:10] I preached now from from 7 to 15 I was
[1:39:14] still in school
[1:39:15] but I preached somewhere all the time
[1:39:18] and during summer I I took the tent I
[1:39:21] preached Under the Tent all up and down
[1:39:24] the East Coast all down through the
[1:39:26] through South through Florida Alabama
[1:39:28] Georgia Mississippi Louisiana South
[1:39:31] Carolina
[1:39:32] North Carolina Virginia West Virginia
[1:39:35] all the way up and did every summer was
[1:39:38] gone the whole summer preaching Under
[1:39:39] the Tent and preached for local churches
[1:39:43] and and anywhere we could drive I
[1:39:45] couldn't even drive
[1:39:47] I had to be carried to Revival my granny
[1:39:49] would carry me church friends would
[1:39:51] carry me and there were two sisters
[1:39:55] Who Loved Me
[1:39:58] they were related to your friend
[1:40:01] Taylor
[1:40:03] and they loved me they loved my Ministry
[1:40:07] they lived over in Phoenix City and they
[1:40:10] would carry me in their van they would
[1:40:12] they took me I cannot tell you the miles
[1:40:15] that those two Godly sisters two two
[1:40:18] grandmothers carried me from church to
[1:40:20] church to church to church to preach and
[1:40:22] they would sing with me we sang and we
[1:40:24] and I preached and because I had no way
[1:40:27] of getting around couldn't drive that
[1:40:29] young
[1:40:30] by the time I was 15
[1:40:33] I had done I'd done a youth pastor a
[1:40:36] stent already at a church in Phoenix
[1:40:38] City I was preaching a Revival in the
[1:40:40] valley and driving back and I stopped in
[1:40:43] at shony's that night and I met some
[1:40:45] some old friends
[1:40:47] and their church was in trouble and they
[1:40:50] invited me to come and help them in
[1:40:51] their Church come and preach fill in
[1:40:54] and I became the interim pastor
[1:40:57] and was later voted in as Pastor so that
[1:40:59] was between the ages of 15 and 16.
[1:41:02] and then uh after that it would have
[1:41:06] been about
[1:41:07] 1985 86
[1:41:10] I started traveling then after that and
[1:41:13] I ended up
[1:41:14] in South Carolina where I started the
[1:41:18] first church that I ever started on my
[1:41:20] own was in Anderson South Carolina and
[1:41:23] that's where I began to hear more of
[1:41:26] what we believe now that's what I was
[1:41:28] about to get to uh
[1:41:30] the church was doing good at first it's
[1:41:33] from According to the book yeah it was
[1:41:34] going good and then all of a sudden it
[1:41:36] started
[1:41:37] problems yes and that's when Brother
[1:41:40] Cleveland and sister started to come up
[1:41:42] let me tell you this I was in Evansville
[1:41:45] Indiana holding a Revival
[1:41:48] and we were fasting and praying and God
[1:41:50] had performed A great miracle there
[1:41:53] several Miracles but an outstanding
[1:41:56] Miracle where a young man was given his
[1:41:58] sight yeah and uh had lost his sight in
[1:42:02] a weedy weed eater accident
[1:42:06] and God had restored his side his whole
[1:42:08] family came to God came back to God or
[1:42:11] to God his God I think that was a
[1:42:13] backslider or whatever he said he came
[1:42:15] running deacon they ran what some of the
[1:42:18] family jumped over the Pew they didn't
[1:42:20] even getting wait to get out to come get
[1:42:22] saved and I thought that and that
[1:42:25] Revival was going so good and we thought
[1:42:27] that it would be because in those days
[1:42:29] Joshua if the god started moving a
[1:42:31] Revival that was scheduled to last three
[1:42:33] nights could last five weeks six weeks
[1:42:35] eight weeks Ten Weeks every night 12
[1:42:39] weeks every night
[1:42:42] and so uh but we were fasting and
[1:42:45] praying in the daytime I had a couple of
[1:42:46] young Brothers with me and uh who were
[1:42:49] traveling with me playing music with me
[1:42:52] and uh we were considering putting the
[1:42:56] tent up again and doing some different
[1:42:58] things and and I received a word from
[1:43:00] the Lord and and the Word was I want you
[1:43:02] to go to Anderson South Carolina and
[1:43:05] there you will receive an end time
[1:43:07] message of Truth for the Bride of Jesus
[1:43:09] Christ
[1:43:10] that's pretty heavy working yeah and I
[1:43:13] remember in the book it said you and the
[1:43:15] guy you were with were like no we're not
[1:43:16] we're not going back especially those
[1:43:18] guys because they had one of them had
[1:43:20] come from there one of them lived right
[1:43:22] outside of Anderson in a place called
[1:43:24] Pickens and all of his old stomping
[1:43:28] grounds and and and party mates were
[1:43:30] there and he didn't want to ever go back
[1:43:32] to that area plus Anderson was known as
[1:43:35] a place where preachers die you know it
[1:43:37] was a rough religious town and it was
[1:43:40] very cruel to me too but anyway God had
[1:43:42] a purpose for me being there
[1:43:44] so I ended up in South Carolina we ended
[1:43:47] up starting a church God God began to
[1:43:50] bless it I still didn't know what this
[1:43:52] end time message means perhaps God was
[1:43:55] going to give me something to preach I
[1:43:57] didn't know what was coming uh
[1:44:00] I had had some experiences uh in the
[1:44:03] past where the Lord had spoken and I
[1:44:06] didn't know what it was going to end up
[1:44:07] being but I was preaching on the radio
[1:44:10] every day
[1:44:13] and a brother a sister Cleveland heard
[1:44:18] the sermon
[1:44:19] she fellowshipped with her husband in a
[1:44:22] church several hours away
[1:44:24] where they honored and respected and
[1:44:27] followed the ministry of of William
[1:44:29] Branham
[1:44:30] and
[1:44:32] uh
[1:44:33] she said to her husband I believe this
[1:44:36] man is preaching the message he must
[1:44:38] know something about brother Branham
[1:44:41] and I want you to hear him so the next
[1:44:43] day at lunch he'd come in early he heard
[1:44:45] the sermon he said Delane you're right
[1:44:47] that's it's what he's preaching
[1:44:49] they ended up asking for permission from
[1:44:52] their Pastor if they could come and
[1:44:53] visit our church because he they drove
[1:44:55] they've been driving for hours if they
[1:44:58] could come miss one service and and
[1:45:00] visit our church and check it out and
[1:45:01] see what was going on and they did and
[1:45:04] in that service
[1:45:06] I preached and brother Cleveland stood
[1:45:08] up and prophesied never met him before
[1:45:11] he stood up and prophesied and said you
[1:45:13] have been raised up as an embarrassment
[1:45:16] to the Pastors in this city and and this
[1:45:19] is what God is going to do and this is
[1:45:21] what God is going to confirm
[1:45:24] and and so God did outstanding things
[1:45:27] there and really if that had to shifted
[1:45:31] at some point I would have probably
[1:45:33] never wanted to leave there but but God
[1:45:36] ultimately wanted me home he wanted me
[1:45:39] back here and I don't know how much of
[1:45:42] that we want to get into today
[1:45:45] we can talk about it another time too
[1:45:48] but uh you know it changed my life he
[1:45:52] brought me some tapes
[1:45:54] Brother Cleveland came to several
[1:45:57] services and he brought me some tapes in
[1:45:59] a brown paper bag
[1:46:01] and they changed my life
[1:46:03] the spoken word is the Original Seed was
[1:46:06] the name of the sermon
[1:46:08] and it changed my life but for a long
[1:46:10] time I didn't listen to them
[1:46:12] because a deacon saw him give him to me
[1:46:15] and he came up to me and he said you
[1:46:16] don't want to listen to that they
[1:46:18] believed some strange things about a
[1:46:20] rattlesnake and you don't want nothing
[1:46:23] to do with that and he tried to
[1:46:25] discourage me he was a very well-meaning
[1:46:27] man he just didn't understand now before
[1:46:30] all this though didn't you weren't you
[1:46:32] telling your grandmother that there was
[1:46:34] something more and you kept going around
[1:46:35] to different meetings and stuff yes when
[1:46:38] I was an older teenager
[1:46:40] a younger teenager I guess you'd say
[1:46:42] yeah
[1:46:44] I heard the Lord in a prayer time I
[1:46:47] heard the Lord's talking to me about the
[1:46:50] coming of the spirit of Elijah
[1:46:53] and that the spirit of Elijah would
[1:46:55] forerun the second coming of Jesus
[1:46:57] Christ so I started preaching that from
[1:46:59] the Bible I preached about John the
[1:47:01] Baptist I preached about Elijah in the
[1:47:04] Bible how Elisha had a double portion
[1:47:07] how John the Baptist was fulfilling some
[1:47:10] of that Commission
[1:47:11] but that I really had this understanding
[1:47:15] from the Lord that there would be
[1:47:17] another installment of this Spirit of
[1:47:20] Elijah kind of ministry before the Lord
[1:47:23] came back and my gran I told my
[1:47:25] grandmother what the Lord had spoken and
[1:47:27] she allowed me to preach it in her
[1:47:29] church
[1:47:30] she did eventually warn me and she said
[1:47:33] I'm afraid honey that people are going
[1:47:36] to think you're pointing to yourself and
[1:47:38] I said myself
[1:47:39] I'm not in any way insinuating that I
[1:47:43] have that kind of a Ministry
[1:47:45] but she was concerned that that someone
[1:47:48] might think that along the way we went
[1:47:50] to hear tip preachers we traveled
[1:47:53] because I was on a search to find
[1:47:56] someone who seemed to have that
[1:47:59] forerunning anointing
[1:48:01] that spirit and power of Elijah on their
[1:48:03] Ministry and I saw I actually came into
[1:48:06] meetings where people claimed it yeah
[1:48:08] where people believed they were
[1:48:11] and and in fact were not and that was
[1:48:14] going around in in the all the way back
[1:48:17] 50s 60s 70s 80s you know people there
[1:48:20] that that was that was a thought but
[1:48:23] when I heard those tapes I didn't listen
[1:48:25] to them for a long time
[1:48:26] things started going pretty bad for me
[1:48:28] in South Carolina just kind of all of a
[1:48:31] sudden
[1:48:31] and uh one day I'm weeping in my office
[1:48:34] I mean weeping on my desk
[1:48:37] on on South Main Street Anderson South
[1:48:40] Carolina and the Lord spoke to me and
[1:48:42] said the answer to every one of your
[1:48:43] problems is in that bag of tapes in that
[1:48:46] brown paper bag
[1:48:48] I heard his voice
[1:48:50] and we should the Bible said his sheep
[1:48:53] know his voice and a stranger they will
[1:48:56] not follow so it's not boasting to say
[1:48:59] we can hear from the Lord the Bible said
[1:49:01] as many as are led by the spirit they
[1:49:04] are the sons of God
[1:49:05] and so God led me and when I heard those
[1:49:08] tapes I knew I didn't know anything
[1:49:10] about William Branham but I knew that
[1:49:13] that was that Ministry that was to
[1:49:15] forerun the second coming of Jesus
[1:49:17] Christ it's not been an easy Journey
[1:49:20] I've not always been accepted among
[1:49:22] those precious people
[1:49:24] but I know that I know that I know that
[1:49:27] I know that God led me to that Ministry
[1:49:30] because there were questions that I had
[1:49:33] that needed to be answered and there
[1:49:36] were imbalances in my life that needed
[1:49:39] to be made right and I needed to
[1:49:41] understand what God was going to do in
[1:49:43] the end time now I personally do not
[1:49:45] believe that all these things ended when
[1:49:48] brother Branham died I believe that
[1:49:51] there is a people a bride being prepared
[1:49:54] right now to work the works of Jesus
[1:49:57] Christ uh
[1:49:59] the scripture is so clear can I read you
[1:50:02] a scripture go ahead I thought I would
[1:50:05] read this because
[1:50:07] sometimes people want to know uh
[1:50:11] what would you advise you know if you
[1:50:14] were to give it Vice to some young
[1:50:17] person or to someone who is
[1:50:21] starting out to serve the Lord you know
[1:50:24] how do how do you stay encouraged and
[1:50:27] how do you how do you pursue
[1:50:30] Christ how do you run after Jesus
[1:50:32] Hebrews 13 7-8 says remember them which
[1:50:37] have the rule over you who have spoken
[1:50:40] unto you the word of God whose Faith
[1:50:43] follow
[1:50:44] considering the end of their
[1:50:46] conversation and you know what the next
[1:50:47] verse is verse 8 it says Jesus Christ
[1:50:51] the same yesterday and today and forever
[1:50:54] one of brother branham's favorite
[1:50:56] Scriptures it is my favorite scripture
[1:50:59] now let me read that in the Amplified
[1:51:01] real quick it says remember your leaders
[1:51:04] and superiors in Authority for it was
[1:51:07] they who brought to you the word of God
[1:51:10] listen to this observe attentively and
[1:51:15] consider their manner of living
[1:51:18] the outcome of their well-spent lives
[1:51:22] and imitate their faith
[1:51:25] now it goes on
[1:51:27] but I want to stop there just by saying
[1:51:30] that would be a word of advice so much I
[1:51:34] have gained by studying the ministry of
[1:51:37] brother Branham
[1:51:38] and others but specifically brother
[1:51:42] Branham because uh I believe I was to be
[1:51:45] connected to that truth but but I have
[1:51:47] been blessed by reading the life of
[1:51:49] other great men of God generals of the
[1:51:53] faith and even women that God used and
[1:51:56] so I would say to to young people today
[1:51:59] stay in the word
[1:52:01] read the word hear the word you all have
[1:52:06] tools today that we didn't have
[1:52:09] you you don't even have to read it you
[1:52:11] can you can Mash play and listen to it
[1:52:14] and digest it
[1:52:16] you've got sermon tapes what we call
[1:52:19] tapes but now they're not on tape their
[1:52:22] messages
[1:52:23] on my phone I can listen to every sermon

[1:54:18] the television broadcasts not all but
[1:54:20] many of them yeah you have access to so
[1:54:23] what I'm saying is stay in that word be
[1:54:26] a word nerd you got to if you're going
[1:54:28] to be a nerd be a word nerd
[1:54:31] get in this Bible and don't be satisfied
[1:54:35] to know what God did for for Stephen
[1:54:38] Shelley
[1:54:39] don't be satisfied to know what God did
[1:54:42] for William Branham you keep pursuing
[1:54:45] him
[1:54:46] staying in that word and praying and and
[1:54:49] Desiring an encounter with God for
[1:54:53] yourself
[1:54:54] don't just be satisfied to read what God
[1:54:57] did a generation ago what's God going to
[1:54:59] do in your generation
[1:55:02] I mean I I am I keep saying it I guess
[1:55:06] it's hitting me hard nearly 55.
[1:55:09] I'm going to serve God the rest of my
[1:55:12] life I am going to preach the gospel the
[1:55:14] rest of my life but I don't know how
[1:55:17] long that is your generation can carry
[1:55:21] this farther than than than my
[1:55:23] generation can
[1:55:24] but you're going to have to stay in the
[1:55:27] word and you're going to have to pursue
[1:55:29] a personal relationship with Jesus
[1:55:33] Christ not depending on your pastor's
[1:55:35] relationship or a prophet's relationship
[1:55:38] but we've all got to have a personal
[1:55:41] Encounter With Jesus Christ I mean I
[1:55:44] think we're starting to run out of time
[1:55:45] but we definitely you know want to get
[1:55:48] you back on here to finish your the rest
[1:55:51] of your life story That's mighty NASA
[1:55:53] how you came back here
[1:55:55] um
[1:55:56] I think
[1:55:58] I I really I think this is gonna
[1:56:02] be big for a lot of people to listen to
[1:56:05] I hope so it's like I said it was really
[1:56:07] something that was in my heart
[1:56:09] um but if you wouldn't mind praying over
[1:56:12] everybody and everybody watching and
[1:56:13] over everything I would I'll be glad to
[1:56:16] pray because I could feel that anointing
[1:56:18] building as we were talking there at the
[1:56:20] end somebody is watching this no doubt
[1:56:23] I'm not trying to be spiritual but
[1:56:26] somebody is watching this no doubt and
[1:56:28] you know that you have a call from God
[1:56:32] whether it's preaching or leading
[1:56:34] worship or writing
[1:56:37] or or social media evangela
[1:56:40] evangelization
[1:56:42] or Mission
[1:56:44] you know you know there's a call on your
[1:56:46] life and and I want you to to learn
[1:56:51] emulate the faith of those that have
[1:56:53] gone before you
[1:56:55] I want you to know how God used brother
[1:56:58] Branham I want you and your siblings and
[1:57:01] the young people of this church to be
[1:57:03] familiar with how God has moved in my
[1:57:05] life but I don't ever want anybody to be
[1:57:08] satisfied knowing that I want every
[1:57:10] person to know what it means for you to
[1:57:14] have an experience with him
[1:57:17] and God wants to use that call he wants
[1:57:20] to put his finger on it and pour His oil
[1:57:22] on it you've got to stay in that word
[1:57:25] you've got to stay in prayer and you've
[1:57:27] got to stay humble
[1:57:29] you know sometimes we promote ourselves
[1:57:31] we can't do that the holy spirit will
[1:57:34] open doors for us I've never had to ask
[1:57:37] people to preach
[1:57:39] even when I was depending as an
[1:57:41] evangelist on an offering to live I
[1:57:44] didn't call people and ask them to could
[1:57:46] I come and preach for you can I come and
[1:57:48] preach for you I'm passing through can I
[1:57:49] I didn't have to do that because the
[1:57:51] Lord said you open your mouth I'll fill
[1:57:53] it and he did the promoting and he did
[1:57:56] the door opening and now I can just be
[1:57:58] thankful to him so don't think you've
[1:58:01] got to promote yourself you let the Holy
[1:58:03] Spirit open the doors you do the praying
[1:58:05] and God will do the rest and maybe
[1:58:08] you're you're an elderly person and you
[1:58:10] think my life is behind me and there's
[1:58:12] nothing left that I can do that's not
[1:58:13] true either we need prayer warriors and
[1:58:17] we need those who have been through the
[1:58:19] fire to give their testimony that's what
[1:58:21] you're going to do on this and the older
[1:58:23] podcast the older people and middle-aged
[1:58:25] people in this church have been such a
[1:58:27] huge you know huge help to all the young
[1:58:29] people here I mean I can name off 10 or
[1:58:32] 15. I hope you'll have them I hope
[1:58:34] you'll have some of them on here even if
[1:58:37] if they have to you know we're work to
[1:58:39] get their thoughts together I hope
[1:58:41] you'll be patient with them and and let
[1:58:43] them share their testimony because
