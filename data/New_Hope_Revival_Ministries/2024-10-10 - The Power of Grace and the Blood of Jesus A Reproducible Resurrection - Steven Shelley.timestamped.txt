[0:00] Jesus is not the the the representative
[0:03] of God and somebody said well how in the
[0:06] world can you can you be the Son of God
[0:09] and be God I tell you it's something
[0:11] that had never happened before and has
[0:13] not happened in the same manner since
[0:16] and that's why the prophet of the Old
[0:18] Testament said who do you think could
[0:19] even believe such a thing something that
[0:22] never been done before is about to be
[0:24] done in the fullness of time God is
[0:27] going to come down the Son of God will
[0:29] become the son of man so that we the
[0:32] Fallen sons of men can be the sons of
[0:34] God it's by grace that we're saved not
[0:37] of Works lest any man should boast but
[0:40] Grace wasn't the
[0:43] token the life of the blood was the
[0:45] token so Grace became the
[0:49] transportation Grace is what took the
[0:51] token of the blood and brought it to
[0:53] your door
[0:55] stop if it hadn't to been for Grace you
[0:57] would have never knew you needed the
[0:59] blood that's right and if it hadn't been
[1:01] for Grace you would have never been made
[1:03] in contact with the blood so we're saved
[1:06] by grace purchased by The Blood Bought
[1:10] With a price Grace didn't buy you the
[1:14] Blood Bought you isn't it wonderful when
[1:16] we can balance All Things by the
[1:19] word he who knew no sin became
[1:24] sin so that we might partake of the
[1:27] righteousness of God how are you going
[1:30] to live a halfway
[1:32] life when you Survey the Wondrous beauty
[1:37] of what God has done on your behalf how
[1:39] could you give him any
[1:41] less than your whole heart how could you
[1:45] even desire to be a Sunday morning
[1:46] Christian and nothing else when you
[1:49] survey the beauty of what it means to be
[1:52] at one in Union under the atoning blood
[1:56] of Jesus Christ being divinely Recon
[1:59] reconciled unto

[2:18] the mind of God you were
[2:20] slated to show up in the last Church age
[2:25] in leoda and God saw your end
[2:30] in the same moment that he saw your
[2:33] beginning God knew you he saw your
[2:36] beginning and your end and he saw your
[2:39] decision the Bible tells us that he saw
[2:42] your choice how do you know the Bible
[2:44] says that because it says by his forn
[2:47] knowledge it's not by what he didn't
[2:50] know about you that he chose you it's by
[2:51] what he knew about you that he chose you
[2:53] by his forn knowledge he chose you and
[2:56] he predestined he said you didn't choose
[2:58] me I chose you amen but he was able to
[3:02] choose you because he
