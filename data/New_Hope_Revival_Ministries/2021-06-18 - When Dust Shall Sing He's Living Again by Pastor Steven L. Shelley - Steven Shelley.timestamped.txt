[0:34] stood beside the graveside
[0:38] of a loved one
[0:42] like planning see
[0:46] to watch and wait for
[0:49] spring that's when he returns
[0:55] with all his power and glory
[1:01] he'll call for death to come
[1:05] to life then dust shall sing
[1:11] with us shall see
[1:15] on resurrection morning
[1:21] the saints will rise
[1:25] and let their voices
[1:28] ring those that remain

[1:51] since jesus died
[1:54] the grave has lost its
[1:57] victory and if you're
[2:01] in christ hold death has
[2:06] lost its thing

[2:13] so he'll conduct the cores
[2:19] with voices raised and
[2:22] shouts of praise dust shall sing
[2:29] when dust shall see
[2:33] on resurrection
[2:39] the saints will rise
[2:43] and let their voices
[2:47] leave

[3:07] oh we'll hear the shout
[3:11] and trumpets out we'll leave the ground
[3:15] wind us shall see
