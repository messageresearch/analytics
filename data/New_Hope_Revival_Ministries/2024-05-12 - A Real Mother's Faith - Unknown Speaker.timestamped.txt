[43:26] week
[43:27] [Applause]
[43:30] again we want to receive the tithe and
[43:33] the offering I believe that it was uh
[43:36] mentioned that we would receive special
[43:38] offering for the building fund today so
[43:40] we'll do that in a little while to
[43:42] conserve time I'm going to ask brother
[43:45] Austin and brother ellias to come to you
[43:47] for the tithe and offering and I'm going
[43:49] to just talk to you a little bit uh give
[43:52] you a little report of what has happened
[43:54] while we were away uh so perhaps you can
[43:57] give while I'm talking uh and we'll give
[44:00] the other offering in just a little bit
[44:03] uh so some time ago last September
[44:08] actually we were uh going to
[44:12] Pennsylvania to minister and we stopped
[44:15] by this church in Ohio brother Shelly
[44:17] had mentioned a video that he had seen
[44:20] he didn't tell me um what it was he just
[44:23] told me that he had watched a video of
[44:25] of this particular pastor and was it
[44:28] brother cam or was it brother Simon cam
[44:31] all right because brother Simon his
[44:32] brother also preached a similar uh
[44:36] message but anyhow that's beside the
[44:38] point these brothers are products of
[44:40] brother Isaiah Brooks um the his
[44:44] ministry when he was in Lima and these
[44:47] these boys were uh they they grew up
[44:50] Assembly of God their parents are still
[44:52] Assembly of God his mother at least and
[44:55] uh they they were Assembly of God and
[44:57] they had you know gone their way college
[44:59] kids and so forth and somehow or another
[45:02] through a Bible study they were
[45:05] connected Simon first was connected with
[45:07] brother books and the assembly there in
[45:10] Lima and so uh brother Simon started
[45:14] going and the the other children they
[45:16] they didn't much see it but as time went
[45:19] on then uh brother cam also saw truth
[45:23] brother Jesse saw truth their sister
[45:25] Betsy saw truth
[45:27] and they started going down to brother
[45:29] Brooks and sat under the sound of the
[45:32] word well things were so moving that his
[45:38] uh brother Cameron's sister Betsy was
[45:41] telling us last Sunday night that the
[45:44] Ministers of the town around where they
[45:46] lived had a conference because of these
[45:50] kids that are leaving their churches for
[45:52] this cult and so they were getting
[45:54] worried because the these young people
[45:57] were going down to Lima to this cult and
[45:59] that's that's how many people were going
[46:01] down there and and sitting under the
[46:03] sound of the word and so you know I
[46:05] don't know where all these people are we
[46:07] were just sitting there talking with
[46:09] with with them last weekend but anyhow
[46:12] we were invited to go to this church uh
[46:16] got a call a few weeks ago asking me to
[46:18] come it it was uh a surprise to me to
[46:22] get the phone call but I responded to it
[46:25] and we went and preached there last
[46:28] weekend and I don't know exactly why
[46:32] that I got so bold but uh I think some
[46:35] of you have have listened to the sermon
[46:38] after brother Shelley said something
[46:39] here last Sunday don't know why that I
[46:42] was so bold don't know why I was so
[46:43] long- winded but I got it out and God
[46:46] did some wonderful things at the end of
[46:49] the service and uh received uh text from
[46:54] somebody you know sometimes you you want
[46:56] wonder about people you you wonder what
[47:00] they're thinking and and how you know
[47:02] they can sit As Dead As a log while
[47:04] they're listening to you but then you
[47:06] get a text that said that was so
[47:08] refreshing wow and uh so I don't know
[47:12] what all the Lord is doing with that I
[47:14] just commit that into his hands but
[47:16] there was a great response and if you
[47:18] watched the whole thing you saw the
[47:20] pastor's response at the end and and I'm
[47:23] grateful for that I didn't I didn't
[47:25] receive any private uh rebuke uh so
[47:31] that's that's good and then Sunday we
[47:33] were given the opportunity to preach
[47:36] again and God did some amazing things at
[47:39] the end of the service again and
[47:42] testimonies were coming into to the
[47:44] pastor um and I've not yet uh I I I've
[47:48] not been able to get a word from him
[47:51] since I left and so I don't know what
[47:53] that's all about but I know God is doing
[47:56] good things no matter what we may see
[47:58] what we may feel what we may hear God is
[48:01] doing good things anyhow one particular
[48:04] one I want to mention there was a there
[48:07] was a brother that came for prayer on
[48:09] Saturday night and and it appeared that
[48:11] he got a a partial break through but he
[48:13] didn't get all that he wanted and Sunday
[48:15] morning after the preaching he came
[48:17] again and he wanted prayer again but you
[48:21] could see that he was lighter than he
[48:23] was the night before and so he came from
[48:26] for prayer and he's just there and he's
[48:30] he started kind of breathing real heavy
[48:33] and I just laid my hands on him and I
[48:35] said that's right breathe in the
[48:37] fragrance of heaven and laid my hands on
[48:40] him and he continued breathing and we
[48:43] went and prayed for somebody else and I
[48:45] watched him as as brother cam took his
[48:48] hands off of him and his expression was
[48:51] just wow and so I don't know what the
[48:54] Lord did for him all I know that God was
[48:57] working in him and I believe God to to
[48:59] do what he wants to do I I believe that
[49:02] God is he's he's connecting the bride in
[49:06] ways that we don't understand bone to
[49:08] bone and and and you know why did that
[49:12] message get preach there when it's what
[49:14] they believe I have no idea unless it's
[49:16] to let somebody know that there's other
[49:18] people out there that believe what you
[49:20] believe and and so God is connecting us
[49:23] he's moving us and and we came home with
[49:26] with uh with other invitations that we
[49:29] don't know exactly how that we're going
[49:30] to be able to to do them but uh we're
[49:34] thankful that the Lord is working and
[49:36] he's moving but I'm thankful to be home
[49:39] with my My Tribe I'm glad to be home
[49:42] with you and to know that God is still
[49:45] moving among us that he is doing
[49:47] marvelous things in our midst and and
[49:51] don't s don't don't have it come out of
[49:53] your mouth well I don't see it
[49:58] you reach in and say Lord I want what
[50:00] there what everybody's I I and when we
[50:02] press in God is faithful to give us what
[50:05] we need he knows how to do it he knows
[50:08] how to he knows how to meet the need in
[50:11] our lives when when we're hungry and
[50:14] thirsty but I'm thankful that he can
[50:17] minister to us I tell you he ministered
[50:19] to me in a song a couple of weeks ago
[50:22] because I was having a little bit of
[50:24] anxiety about a new place and he
[50:27] ministered in a song in a beautiful way
[50:29] and I watched the Lord perform exactly
[50:31] what that song said I watched him
[50:34] perform it while we were gone uh we had
[50:36] the opportunity to go over and visit the
[50:39] the uh our friends at the fellowship in
[50:42] Indiana our former Amish friends that
[50:44] are there continuing on in the uh
[50:47] presence of the Lord and we ministered
[50:50] at their little gathering there on
[50:52] Wednesday night and we're thankful for
[50:55] what the Lord is doing among them and
[50:58] and though the enemy rages God moves on
[51:01] and he helps them to keep pressing on
[51:03] and we're thankful for what God is doing
[51:06] in them and through them how that they
[51:08] are reaching out uh some of you know
[51:11] sometimes I wonder if they're ever home
[51:13] it always seems like that they're
[51:15] traveling and and most of you know who
[51:17] brother Elum is and it was kind of neat
[51:20] while we were in Ohio and the pastor's
[51:24] brother brother Simon who works with him
[51:27] there in the church he is kind of a
[51:31] teacher but he was going over to preach
[51:34] for brother Levi Yoder over in Navar
[51:37] Ohio and when they found out that we
[51:40] knew them and then we knew that brother
[51:44] elim was going over there on Sunday of
[51:47] course we knew them and then we were
[51:48] going on to that Fellowship in in uh
[51:51] Indiana and so it's just so neat to see
[51:53] how that God ties us all together we're
[51:56] just worshiping the Lord and and giving
[51:58] him praise and thanking him for this
[52:00] message of truth that he has given to us
[52:03] friends I am thankful for this message
[52:06] of truth that God has given to us he is
[52:09] so so faithful I'm glad that he is
[52:13] working both to Will and to do of his
[52:16] good pleasure to bring us to our
[52:19] completed purpose in the earth that's
[52:22] right well did you enjoy your fellowship
[52:24] under the Tabernacle last week

[52:38] throw that up
[52:39] there something happened since you were
[52:47] there so now there's stud wall in the
[52:51] middle part there the uh the windows and
[52:54] the doors did not come in so that didn't
[52:57] get done yesterday like we had hoped but
[53:00] uh they'll be in this coming week they
[53:02] were uh they're probably sitting there
[53:05] now the truck was on its way um they
[53:09] they just didn't know when it would
[53:10] arrive but uh anyhow um if if the
[53:14] weather is good we'll probably try to
[53:16] have a a work day next week um I I think
[53:20] that there's maybe a shower so we'll
[53:22] have to coordinate around that but uh
[53:24] anyhow the the the Tabernacle project
[53:29] continues to move forward and we are
[53:31] very thankful for the giving there's

[1:05:16] amen I was telling my family yesterday
[1:05:19] that when I first came around the
[1:05:21] message I got the impression from all
[1:05:25] preachers
[1:05:26] just about all preachers that that women
[1:05:30] were very very
[1:05:33] subservient and very low in God's
[1:05:36] economy I'm being honest it seemed like
[1:05:40] every message I heard was straightening
[1:05:43] the women out and the more I got to know
[1:05:46] about the
[1:05:49] brothers the more I realized why they
[1:05:51] were always slinging at the women
[1:05:54] because it kept the attention off of
[1:05:56] their life you don't have to say
[1:06:00] anything and I was so under that
[1:06:02] influence that one of the first Mother's
[1:06:05] Day sermons I preached at this church
[1:06:08] was dominating
[1:06:11] female and I stand by everything I said
[1:06:16] but I realize that that has been harped
[1:06:20] on quite a bit and now it's time to
[1:06:24] remember that we we are not taking our
[1:06:26] identification with Eve our sisters find
[1:06:30] their place in Mary's heart be it unto
[1:06:34] me according to your word now that
[1:06:37] doesn't mean that a sister can't get out
[1:06:39] of place but so can a brother and it's
[1:06:42] the word the word is what brings them I
[1:06:44] tell you you just put on the
[1:06:46] tape that that word will help bring us
[1:06:49] all back into our roles and it'll do it
[1:06:52] in a hurry and the biggest problem
[1:06:54] around this truth is not a dominating
[1:06:57] female I can assure you of that and I
[1:07:00] see some brothers who are uh just
[1:07:02] constantly harping and posting and
[1:07:04] harping and posting and I'm thinking to
[1:07:07] myself is there not a Godly woman
[1:07:10] anywhere in your life that you could
[1:07:12] lift up and say something positive about
[1:07:15] so we are extremely blessed in this
[1:07:18] little small Church to be able to say
[1:07:21] that we have so many Godly women and
[1:07:25] Godly mothers Among Us who are holding
[1:07:28] an example if you agree with me you can
[1:07:31] clap your
[1:07:40] hands and that being said we're not
[1:07:43] we're going at the end of the service
[1:07:45] after we have prayed for all the mothers
[1:07:47] we have a gift for every mother and uh
[1:07:50] also at the end of the service when
[1:07:53] we're dismissed those of you who who
[1:07:55] take a special gift you can come and get
[1:07:57] it but we'll leave everything in place
[1:08:00] uh for now but we need to find out who
[1:08:04] the oldest mother is in this house today
[1:08:07] so that we can honor her sister how old
[1:08:12] is Sister
[1:08:14] Gertrude
[1:08:15] 87 Sister
[1:08:18] Williams
[1:08:20] 87 she's older than you are
[1:08:26] by how many
[1:08:29] months four or five months maybe well
[1:08:33] that means that sister Gertrude is our
[1:08:37] oldest mother and we want to honor her
[1:08:39] and love her so sister Terry make sure
[1:08:42] you all pick pick a flower at the end of
[1:08:44] the service God Bless
[1:08:46] [Applause]
[1:08:50] you that's so sweet of you to mention I
[1:08:53] appreciate that uh uh and then we need
[1:08:56] to find the youngest mother and that's
[1:08:58] not almost mother that's
[1:09:02] mother and uh well it used to always be
[1:09:06] it used to always be Megan you know I
[1:09:08] don't know how how many years did you I
[1:09:10] mean you all must have been married at
[1:09:14] 12 had babies at 13 or something I don't
[1:09:17] know because it seems to me like you
[1:09:19] were the youngest mother forever aren't
[1:09:21] you about what
[1:09:23] 29 29 you will be 29 are there any
[1:09:29] Mothers here younger than

[1:09:44] youngest mother so you be sure to get a
[1:09:46] flower when you go to leave
[1:09:50] 22 oh
[1:09:52] my let me tell you again that I have
[1:09:55] socks in my drawer that I still wear
[1:09:59] that are 22 years old so we're thankful

[1:15:46] [Applause]
[1:15:51] morning Brothers oh oh I almost missed
[1:15:54] the
[1:15:55] biggie brother Steve
[1:15:57] Shaw has a
[1:15:59] birthday and for those of you that don't
[1:16:02] know he was born in
[1:16:04] 1959 and his birthday Saturday happy
[1:16:08] birthday
[1:16:11] brother how many days a week do you work
[1:16:17] out let's let's be honest now we're in
[1:16:19] the house of God
[1:16:22] three okay about three days a week I
[1:16:25] think that's pretty incredible don't you
[1:16:28] three days a week let's give him a hand
[1:16:30] for
[1:16:34] that he's not going for beefy he's going
[1:16:37] for
[1:16:38] longevity amen and moving your body
[1:16:41] that's a good thing brother God bless
[1:16:42] you for that let's uh let's turn in our
[1:16:46] Bible this morning we have quite a bit
[1:16:48] to cover Psalm 31 I'm going to read the
[1:16:52] V first five verses of Psalm 31 in the
[1:16:55] Amplified and I'm doing that to save
[1:16:57] time I had both of them in my notes but
[1:17:00] uh I I've got something that's going to
[1:17:02] take a little bit of time toward the end
[1:17:05] so I want to get this in so that you
[1:17:06] have plenty of time to be with your
[1:17:09] families uh today uh I want you to know
[1:17:12] that brother brandham was not much for
[1:17:15] Mother's Day in itself he believed that
[1:17:18] it was kind of a commercial type thing
[1:17:21] and that it was abused and that people
[1:17:25] maybe would bring a bouquet to Mother on
[1:17:27] Mother's Day and forget her the rest of
[1:17:29] the time so he really encouraged people
[1:17:32] to honor their mother every day every
[1:17:36] day and be thankful for them but as I
[1:17:39] was reading this morning I had
[1:17:41] everything in place uh except this as I
[1:17:44] was reading this morning some things
[1:17:46] that brother brandham said about mama I
[1:17:48] W you to know I could not keep the tears
[1:17:51] from from falling and uh he he told us
[1:17:55] some things about why we're where we are
[1:17:57] today and for a lot of us it's because
[1:18:00] Mama Prayed you understand and when my
[1:18:04] mama was alive I used to always almost
[1:18:06] always sing on Mother's Day uh when Mama
[1:18:10] Prayed Heaven paid attention and I
[1:18:13] believe that I truly do I don't believe
[1:18:16] that mothers are the only ones who have
[1:18:19] that uh pull on God but brother brandom
[1:18:21] said he gave them a gift for this he
[1:18:24] gave gave them a gift to intercede for
[1:18:26] their children and I believe that with
[1:18:29] all my heart in verse one said in you oh
[1:18:33] Lord do I put my trust and seek Refuge
[1:18:38] let me never be put to shame or have my
[1:18:42] hope in you disappointed deliver me in
[1:18:48] your righteousness bow down your ear to
[1:18:52] me Deliver Me speedily be my rock of
[1:18:56] Refuge a strong Fortress to save me yes
[1:19:02] you are my rock and my Fortress can you
[1:19:05] say Amen therefore for your name's sake
[1:19:09] lead me and guide me draw me out of the
[1:19:15] net that they have laid secretly for me
[1:19:19] for You Are My Strength and my
[1:19:23] stronghold Hallelujah
[1:19:25] into your hands I commit my spirit you
[1:19:29] have redeemed me oh Lord the god of
[1:19:32] Truth and faithfulness can the Saints
[1:19:35] say amen I don't care how big the snare
[1:19:39] I don't have I don't care how deep the
[1:19:41] net there is a God we serve a God we
[1:19:45] know a God who can deliver us out of
[1:19:48] every snare of the enemy who can deliver
[1:19:51] us out of every pit that the enemy or
[1:19:53] our enemies would dig for us our hope is
[1:19:57] in the Lord he's a strong tower he's a
[1:20:00] mighty Rock he's a fortress do you
[1:20:03] believe that we're blessed Psalm
[1:20:07] 31:
[1:20:09] 10-2 said who can find a virtuous woman
[1:20:14] for her price is far above rubies the
[1:20:19] heart of her husband does safely trust
[1:20:24] in her
[1:20:25] so that he shall have no need of spoil
[1:20:29] let me say that when a father when a
[1:20:34] husband can trust his wife he has found
[1:20:39] a real
[1:20:41] treasure mistrust in a marriage brings
[1:20:45] dysfunction in a family do you hear what
[1:20:48] I'm saying when a wife can't trust her
[1:20:51] husband when a husband can't seem to
[1:20:54] trust his wife it brings dysfunction in
[1:20:58] the entire family so sometimes it's a
[1:21:02] wound that we carry that has nothing to
[1:21:04] do with our
[1:21:06] companion I need a little help it's one
[1:21:09] that we brought with us into the
[1:21:11] marriage and because of some wound or
[1:21:14] some hurt that we have experienced in
[1:21:17] life we bring that lack of trust into a
[1:21:21] marriage relationship and we bring
[1:21:23] dysfunction to our children so if you
[1:21:26] should somehow discern this morning that
[1:21:30] that your your heart cannot trust and
[1:21:34] feel safety in in your wife or in your
[1:21:37] husband ask the Lord to help you find
[1:21:40] that place it's a very important place
[1:21:43] in all relationships including
[1:21:46] friendships to know that someone has
[1:21:49] your best interest to know that you can
[1:21:52] really feel safe in a relationship is a
[1:21:56] very important element in the hour that
[1:21:58] we're living in I'll let you say Amen am
[1:22:02] she will do him good and not evil all
[1:22:07] the days of her life that doesn't mean
[1:22:11] she won't make
[1:22:12] mistakes but she will not do him harm or
[1:22:16] evil verse 25 of the same chapter
[1:22:20] strength and honor are her clothing and
[1:22:24] he shall rejoice in time to
[1:22:29] come she openeth her mouth with
[1:22:33] wisdom and in her tongue is the law of
[1:22:38] kindness hear these words she lookth
[1:22:41] well to the ways of her household and
[1:22:46] eateth not the bread of idleness her
[1:22:50] children arise up and call her blessed
[1:22:55] her husband also and he praiseth her
[1:23:01] with his words with his actions he lifts
[1:23:05] her up he doesn't want to be responsible
[1:23:08] for pulling her down he wants to be
[1:23:10] responsible for lifting her up if you
[1:23:12] lift your wife up the mother of your
[1:23:15] children you're really benefiting your
[1:23:18] children because a woman in the despair
[1:23:21] of depression is not the kind of mother
[1:23:23] she was born to be that's right and a
[1:23:26] family has a responsibility in lifting
[1:23:29] that mother up so that she can be
[1:23:32] everything she needs to be for her
[1:23:34] children some of you your children are
[1:23:36] small but you will certainly see the
[1:23:40] importance of that and it's very
[1:23:42] important for a husband to speak words
[1:23:47] of affirmation to his wife in front of
[1:23:50] the children it's very important many
[1:23:53] daughters have done virtuously but thou
[1:23:57] excellest them all I'm never jealous
[1:24:01] when someone says I have the best wife
[1:24:04] there is because I know I do so I'm
[1:24:07] never jealous over them and every
[1:24:09] husband ought to feel that way and if we
[1:24:12] can't there's something wrong here here
[1:24:15] Solomon is speaking and he said there
[1:24:17] are many daughters who do virtuous thing
[1:24:19] but you're the top of the list and I
[1:24:22] feel that way today I feel like I got
[1:24:25] that one and we should feel that way me
[1:24:29] uh favor is deceitful and beauty is vain
[1:24:34] but a woman that feareth the Lord she
[1:24:37] shall be praised praised these are the
[1:24:41] same words in Hebrew that are used to
[1:24:44] lift up God come on so you're you're not
[1:24:49] stealing Glory from God when you lift up
[1:24:53] your mother when you lift up your wife
[1:24:56] and it must not be Beauty that's keeping
[1:24:59] everything
[1:25:01] together because you'll you'll one day
[1:25:04] wake up and and when she takes out her
[1:25:06] teeth and her glasses and her hearing
[1:25:09] aids and lays them on the on the on the
[1:25:12] nightstand it'll be true what George y
[1:25:16] used to say you'll have as much of her
[1:25:17] on one side of you as you do the
[1:25:20] other so it must not be about beauty
[1:25:24] it must be more than that some of you
[1:25:27] couldn't even laugh because you didn't
[1:25:29] get it you'll get it in about 20 minutes
[1:25:31] or something from now give her of the
[1:25:34] fruit of her hands and let her own works
[1:25:38] praise her in the gates may God add his
[1:25:42] Blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:25:44] may be seated but I'm asking for your
[1:25:46] attention this morning I want to go
[1:25:49] first to a message called Mother's Day
[1:25:54] and there are several places in this
[1:25:57] message that I want to share with you
[1:25:59] today because they had such a deep
[1:26:01] impact on me when I read them again this
[1:26:05] morning mother is so great you know the
[1:26:10] first one that receives you in this life
[1:26:14] is your
[1:26:15] mother I know we know that but that hits
[1:26:19] us hard sometime when we think about it
[1:26:22] no one can touch you because you're
[1:26:24] conceived and she Bears you under her
[1:26:28] heart and she is the first to know you
[1:26:33] could we say truly know you and the
[1:26:36] first two in this life to hold you then
[1:26:41] when you're born she is one of the first
[1:26:44] hands that touch you and wipes back the
[1:26:48] tears out of your eyes she is the first
[1:26:52] one to Pat you and to love you and to CP
[1:26:56] over you in this life is your mother now
[1:27:00] I think that there is not enough honor
[1:27:03] that we could give to a mother mother is
[1:27:08] first with the child and she is a great
[1:27:12] responsibility of what that child will
[1:27:15] be will be based upon the way that
[1:27:18] mother starts that child on the path
[1:27:23] that it must travel I want you to think
[1:27:25] with me just a moment of what a heavy
[1:27:28] responsibility is laid on the woman
[1:27:32] yes it's not laid exactly like that on
[1:27:36] the father it's laid particularly hard
[1:27:41] on the shoulders of the mother because
[1:27:44] she has the time with the child this is
[1:27:48] why brother brandham did not encourage
[1:27:50] women to have jobs outside of the home
[1:27:55] so that she could spend stay with me
[1:27:59] because she could spend all that time
[1:28:02] that quality time while they were young
[1:28:06] so that she could love them and nurture
[1:28:08] them and teach them let me say that it
[1:28:12] was never to be the responsibility of
[1:28:15] the government to educate our children
[1:28:18] it was always to be our responsibility
[1:28:22] to do that and the mother responsibility
[1:28:25] the most it was to fall on her she that
[1:28:29] that child will hear his first his or
[1:28:32] her first Bible story from a mother amen
[1:28:36] we don't have Sunday School in this
[1:28:38] church and the reason why we don't is
[1:28:41] simply because we believe that it's not
[1:28:44] someone else's responsibility to teach
[1:28:47] your children the beginning stages of
[1:28:50] the faith it's your responsibility and a
[1:28:53] mother a woman should take that so heavy
[1:28:57] because you know it's not like a
[1:29:00] plant I'm going to preach a little bit
[1:29:03] it's not like a green plant you know
[1:29:05] everybody these last few years uh have
[1:29:08] just gone crazy over house plants and
[1:29:13] it's fun to start with and it gives you
[1:29:16] a great Instagram moment and you can
[1:29:19] post all the green but after a while you
[1:29:22] may get tired of those plants
[1:29:25] and I don't know how many have died on
[1:29:27] the Shelf because it oh that was a lot
[1:29:31] of
[1:29:32] laughter that was too much laughter if
[1:29:35] someone wasn't relating to it they
[1:29:40] die someone told me they said I like
[1:29:44] succulents because they don't ever have
[1:29:46] to be watered are you
[1:29:48] kidding every living plant has to be
[1:29:51] watered at some point and some more than
[1:29:55] others and people will buy one and they
[1:29:57] don't even know the instructions and
[1:29:59] they'll just treat it anyway don't
[1:30:01] Google don't and they wonder why it
[1:30:03] doesn't survive because you don't take
[1:30:05] up time you can't treat your children
[1:30:07] like that you know people will take on a
[1:30:10] hobby or even sometimes they'll take on
[1:30:13] the responsibility of helping somebody
[1:30:15] else with their kids and uh then they
[1:30:18] grow tired of that they babysitting for
[1:30:22] instance you know when they when their
[1:30:24] arm babies like April's got an arm arm
[1:30:27] full they're not as much trouble for a
[1:30:31] babysitter but when they get a little
[1:30:33] bit older when they can talk
[1:30:37] back when they can
[1:30:39] talk brother that's something to get
[1:30:41] over right there I thought the other day
[1:30:45] as Ezekiel was talking 90 miles a minute
[1:30:50] is that right brother Robert you all had
[1:30:51] him for the night 9 miles a minute and
[1:30:55] he was going into all kinds of things
[1:30:57] and I thought to myself all for the day
[1:31:01] that all he said was
[1:31:04] mama and you're sitting there thinking
[1:31:07] oh I wish he could put a sentence
[1:31:08] together and the next thing you know
[1:31:10] they can and they don't hush you can't
[1:31:14] put them away like a
[1:31:17] hobby they're your responsibility until
[1:31:20] they're grown yes sir so a mother who
[1:31:23] takes takes her responsibility serious
[1:31:26] no wonder the Bible said she ought to
[1:31:27] get some praise she ought to get some
[1:31:31] recognition brother brandom goes on to
[1:31:33] say that Mother starts that child on the
[1:31:36] path that it must travel mother has the
[1:31:39] responsibility from God to place that
[1:31:42] child on the right Road and I think
[1:31:45] that's why mothers has a special
[1:31:48] touch now that's through paragraph
[1:31:51] 32 let's keep moving paragraph
[1:31:56] 34 you know a man like
[1:31:59] Moses if I could credit anything to his
[1:32:02] character it was because he had a
[1:32:05] godsent mother he's talking about the
[1:32:09] greatest prophet of the Old Testament
[1:32:12] and he's saying that much of what he
[1:32:16] accomplished could be credited to a
[1:32:19] mother a godsent mother he said you know
[1:32:23] it was she that had prayed yoked and had
[1:32:26] longed for this
[1:32:33] baby and when he was born she was the
[1:32:37] one who CED him and cuddled him and
[1:32:40] built the ark and placed him in the bull
[1:32:43] rushes when her poor with her poor when
[1:32:46] her poor heart breaking her only little
[1:32:49] baby and it was the most outstanding
[1:32:51] little chump that was in all the world
[1:32:53] world and how a mother likes any baby
[1:32:57] but to see this special little
[1:33:00] fellow and then in her heart she knew
[1:33:04] that he was born for a purpose don't you
[1:33:09] understand that and then to take him and
[1:33:12] place him into the very den of
[1:33:14] crocodiles out into the river by faith
[1:33:19] she did that the title of this message
[1:33:23] today is a real mother's faith faith
[1:33:26] that can ground a plane how many of you
[1:33:29] know where that comes from faith that
[1:33:31] can ground a plane and then in her heart
[1:33:33] she knew that he was born for a purpose
[1:33:36] uh by faith she did that knowing that
[1:33:40] God was able to take care of him and to
[1:33:42] summarize the love of a mother and the
[1:33:45] action of the character of her faith I
[1:33:49] like that for Faith does not Place
[1:33:51] itself upon the shifting SS of what it
[1:33:55] can see Faith rests solemnly upon the UN
[1:34:01] unmovable Rock of God's Eternal Word
[1:34:05] brother that's powerful statement to
[1:34:08] make she didn't have faith in faith she
[1:34:11] had faith in God her faith wasn't in
[1:34:15] Good Luck it wasn't in faith her faith
[1:34:19] was in the Eternal promise of God's word
[1:34:23] and she knew that God would fulfill his
[1:34:26] purpose in the life of her son if she
[1:34:29] was faithful to stir him to steer Him to
[1:34:34] guide him to nourish him for by Faith
[1:34:37] said the scripture she did this and
[1:34:40] faith can take its stand on the rock
[1:34:44] that the waves are beating the
[1:34:46] foundations out and look straight into
[1:34:49] the face of death and know that it'll be
[1:34:52] just in a little bit but faith can look
[1:34:55] across the sea to him that said I am the
[1:35:01] resurrection and life and fail to even
[1:35:04] hear listen What Faith Can Do faith can
[1:35:07] look out over the sea and fail to hear
[1:35:10] the waves are dashing because Faith
[1:35:13] doesn't look at the circumstances Faith
[1:35:16] looks at the Rock and who do we know
[1:35:19] that has more of that rock kind of Faith
[1:35:23] than a Godly mother she has to look and
[1:35:27] see as her children get older they start
[1:35:29] making wrong
[1:35:31] choices and uh you know there used to be
[1:35:34] a time that they tried to hide things
[1:35:37] from mother but there's such a boldness
[1:35:40] and a brassiness on this
[1:35:43] generation that they don't even try to
[1:35:45] hide their Dirty Deeds from their Godly
[1:35:48] mother anymore come on they come to
[1:35:51] Mama's House dressed anyway way uh and
[1:35:55] they come acting
[1:35:57] anyway and they come with everything
[1:35:59] pierced that can be
[1:36:01] pierced and if that's not bad enough
[1:36:04] they post it all on
[1:36:06] Facebook so mother has to see son and
[1:36:10] daughter with a with a mixed drink in
[1:36:12] their hand come on that's not respect
[1:36:16] somebody said well I want to be me and I
[1:36:18] don't want to hide it look folks that's
[1:36:21] too hard on a mother
[1:36:24] it's not right she has to know all of
[1:36:27] that and then she has to make up her
[1:36:29] mind I'm not looking at The Dashing
[1:36:32] waves I'm not listening at what
[1:36:34] circumstances are telling me I'm looking
[1:36:36] at a promise that God has given me my
[1:36:40] children how many mothers in this house
[1:36:43] and streaming this service refuse to see
[1:36:45] and hear the waves around them dashing
[1:36:48] in other direction and you're you're
[1:36:50] choosing to keep your faith anchored on
[1:36:53] the Rock of Ages because you believe
[1:36:55] that God will bring your children to you
[1:36:59] now let me say I understand that
[1:37:01] everyone in this room didn't have that
[1:37:03] kind of mother but I refuse to to give
[1:37:06] in a woke
[1:37:09] society that says you've got to tiptoe
[1:37:11] around all the different situations in
[1:37:14] the
[1:37:15] house I can't do that anymore because I
[1:37:18] see it as a part of a liberal agenda
[1:37:24] and you got to ask you got to make sure
[1:37:26] you got to you got to you've got to make
[1:37:28] sure that that someone who didn't have
[1:37:30] that kind of mother is okay look folk
[1:37:32] you're where you are today because of
[1:37:34] God's grace if mother didn't help you
[1:37:36] get to where you are you have no one
[1:37:38] else to think but
[1:37:40] him and the Bible tells us he'll be a
[1:37:42] mother to us he's a mother to the
[1:37:45] motherless and a father to the
[1:37:48] fatherless and the reality is we can't
[1:37:50] let our mother issues affect us in this
[1:37:53] hour we got to say I know my mother did
[1:37:56] about the best that she was capable of
[1:37:58] doing but his amazing grace that brought
[1:38:02] me this far come on now let's go on
[1:38:07] that's the kind of faith that Moses
[1:38:08] mother had she taught him and she reared
[1:38:11] him in the Palace of pharaoh which was a
[1:38:13] miracle wasn't it Supernatural teaching
[1:38:16] him that he was born for a
[1:38:19] purpose you and I as parents have that
[1:38:22] responsibility that's right somebody
[1:38:24] said well uh are all children born for a
[1:38:27] purpose you're mighty right they are you
[1:38:30] may not know what the purpose is but
[1:38:32] it's not wrong for you to say son you
[1:38:34] were born for a purpose you're going to
[1:38:37] have to discover from God what that
[1:38:40] purpose is and fulfill it when you're
[1:38:42] old enough to do such a thing as that
[1:38:43] daughter you are born for a
[1:38:48] purpose and I want you to know that we
[1:38:51] are blessed we're blessed today when I
[1:38:55] look out over this room I say we are
[1:38:58] extremely blessed she was teaching him
[1:39:01] that he was born for a purpose that
[1:39:03] Jehovah had answered her prayer she
[1:39:06] could not have had he could not have had
[1:39:08] a better teacher that's what helped mold
[1:39:11] the character that Moses was what mother
[1:39:17] mother's Faith remember brother brandham
[1:39:19] calls the The Fifth
[1:39:21] Gospel Matthew Mark Luke
[1:39:24] John and
[1:39:28] mother because by the time a child is
[1:39:31] old enough to read he's had more of
[1:39:33] mother in him more influence of mother
[1:39:37] than he has of Matthew Mark Luke and
[1:39:39] John it's the truth I want to go on to
[1:39:42] paragraph 42 but in the face of all that
[1:39:46] one day he made a statement like this
[1:39:48] and I'm going to tell you who he is he
[1:39:51] is Abraham Lincoln brother Brandon was
[1:39:54] talking about Abraham Lincoln in the
[1:39:56] paragraphs before this and he said I
[1:40:00] consider him to be one of the greatest
[1:40:01] presidents of the United States of
[1:40:03] America and he talked about his humble
[1:40:06] beginning and some of his suffering some
[1:40:08] of the things that he'd been through and
[1:40:10] he said but in the face of all that one
[1:40:12] day he made a statement like this he
[1:40:14] said if there could be any good thing
[1:40:16] found in me it's because of a Godly
[1:40:19] mother that raised him to serve the Lord
[1:40:25] now she knew he had a purpose and she
[1:40:27] spoke life into him because of that
[1:40:31] purpose you see a child listens to its
[1:40:36] mother some little touch about that
[1:40:39] mother that a child will listen to when
[1:40:43] it's hurt it'll go to the mother for
[1:40:46] consolation before it'll go to the
[1:40:50] father it's natural behavior in most
[1:40:52] cases
[1:40:54] and sometimes daddies have a hard time
[1:40:56] with that don't it's nothing personal
[1:40:59] it's a gift that God gives a mother she
[1:41:02] has a gift given to her from God to be
[1:41:05] that nurturing soul that nurturing
[1:41:08] spirit for that child they'll come to
[1:41:11] you when it's time for the
[1:41:16] keys but mama's the one most of the time
[1:41:18] that's going to kiss the boo
[1:41:22] boos I didn't bring the quotation but in
[1:41:25] this sermon just before brother brandham
[1:41:28] was talking about Abraham Lincoln he
[1:41:29] said there's a woman here he said I
[1:41:32] don't want to hurt you sister he said
[1:41:34] but but I want to tell this story she
[1:41:37] has a son who's an
[1:41:39] alcoholic and she said he goes off on
[1:41:42] the weekend and gets so drunk that he
[1:41:45] don't hardly know who he is I'm
[1:41:47] paraphrasing a little bit but he doesn't
[1:41:49] hardly know who he is and he said and
[1:41:52] when he gets to to thinking about what
[1:41:54] he's done he goes home to
[1:41:57] Mama he said he goes in and he crawls in
[1:42:01] Mama's bed wraps his arms around his
[1:42:05] mother and a grown man and finds his
[1:42:10] consolation there even in his condition
[1:42:14] he realizes that Mama is the one that's
[1:42:17] holding on to God for him and he feels
[1:42:21] that affection for her even in that in
[1:42:24] that condition then he goes on to talk
[1:42:26] about Abraham Lincoln and then he says
[1:42:29] because she was first with it you know
[1:42:32] and there's some gift that God gives a
[1:42:36] mother to be that way I mean a real
[1:42:40] mother and I'm talking about the faith
[1:42:42] of a real mother brother brandham said
[1:42:45] having a baby doesn't make a woman a
[1:42:49] mother he said I saw in the news about a
[1:42:52] woman who threw her baby over the bridge
[1:42:55] that's not a
[1:42:56] mother that's a woman who had a baby so
[1:43:00] it wasn't just having a baby that makes
[1:43:02] a woman a mother it's the way she raises
[1:43:05] her children and the way she speaks life
[1:43:08] into them I'm so thankful that that God
[1:43:12] has given some in this house and around
[1:43:16] the world in this message a baby to
[1:43:19] raise that didn't come from their body
[1:43:21] but in the eyes of God God they're more
[1:43:24] a
[1:43:25] mother than the one who birthed the
[1:43:28] child and so you don't have to feel any
[1:43:31] less you're fulfilling a very important
[1:43:34] role and this proves that God gave you
[1:43:37] the gift to do it that it's not
[1:43:40] biological it's a gift from God to be
[1:43:43] able to nurture now I believe that
[1:43:45] mothers are honorable and and godly but
[1:43:49] I believe such as Mother's Days like
[1:43:52] this is it make a lot of money out of
[1:43:54] flowers and things but Mother's Day
[1:43:58] should be every
[1:44:00] day not to send her a bunch of flowers
[1:44:03] on Mother's Day do that it's okay to do
[1:44:06] that but to love her and care for her
[1:44:12] 365 days and nights through the
[1:44:17] year but of course the commercial world
[1:44:19] has a great hold in all things like this
[1:44:22] and it depre appreci mother oh well last
[1:44:24] Mother's Day I sent her a bunch of
[1:44:27] flowers I read this paragraph to my wife
[1:44:31] this morning and I sobbed I could hardly
[1:44:33] get it out he said she would appreciate
[1:44:37] a whole lot more than the bouquet of
[1:44:40] flowers just sit down and talk to her
[1:44:44] just a little
[1:44:47] bit how many mothers would so appreciate
[1:44:51] a conversation
[1:44:54] instead of saying I've heard that you've
[1:44:57] already told me
[1:45:00] that mother I don't need to hear that
[1:45:03] anymore how wonderful it would be to
[1:45:06] just sit down and talk to her just a
[1:45:08] little bit write her a
[1:45:11] line now people don't write letters it
[1:45:14] seems anymore but you could shoot her a
[1:45:17] text someone said that's impersonal let
[1:45:20] me tell you something a mother would
[1:45:23] appreciate hearing from
[1:45:25] you send her a corny
[1:45:28] joke send her an
[1:45:30] emoji send her a meme come
[1:45:34] on nobody spends money on Hallmark cards
[1:45:37] anymore it seems do what you can to let
[1:45:41] her know I'm here for you I might not be
[1:45:44] always in in sight but I'm here Pat her
[1:45:48] on the
[1:45:49] shoulder kiss her on the cheek hear me
[1:45:54] you're never too
[1:45:57] big you're never too old to kiss your
[1:46:01] mother on the
[1:46:03] cheek and we should do it it'll go a lot
[1:46:07] farther tell her that you love her it'll
[1:46:10] go a lot farther than all the flowers
[1:46:13] that you could buy from the Florest
[1:46:15] brother random said that's true I want
[1:46:18] you to look at Deuteronomy chapter 6
[1:46:20] verse 6 and 7 and these these words
[1:46:23] which I command thee this day shall be
[1:46:26] in thine heart and thou shalt teach them
[1:46:30] diligently unto thy children and shall
[1:46:33] talk of them when thou sest in thine
[1:46:37] house and when thou walkest by the way
[1:46:41] and when thou liest down and when thou
[1:46:44] risest up let me ask you a question when
[1:46:47] are you supposed to talk to your
[1:46:49] children about the things of God it
[1:46:52] sounds to me like all
[1:46:54] times it sounds to me Samantha like a
[1:46:58] walk is a good time to talk to your kids
[1:47:02] I'm referring to a little text that she
[1:47:04] sent this week so
[1:47:07] encouraging and uh she asked a question
[1:47:10] and got reminded that Pastor has said
[1:47:13] that several times
[1:47:16] lately you say well that that might have
[1:47:19] made her feel terrible no it made her
[1:47:21] feel amazing and maybe she didn't tell
[1:47:22] tell him she told me so now she's outed
[1:47:25] it made her feel
[1:47:27] amazing it thrilled her because to know
[1:47:30] that your children are listening in
[1:47:35] church listen God didn't give you those
[1:47:37] children so you can sit outside and use
[1:47:39] them as an excuse not to be in the
[1:47:43] house God didn't give you those children
[1:47:46] to send them to
[1:47:48] church brother Brandon was against that
[1:47:51] kind of behavior and so am I S sending
[1:47:53] your children to no you be there and you
[1:47:56] bring them there and you make sure
[1:47:58] they're there and that doesn't just go
[1:48:00] from
[1:48:03] mothers the men of God you know God's
[1:48:05] men they want to take back masculinity
[1:48:08] and they want to they want to be the
[1:48:09] kind of man that they ought to be then
[1:48:11] the way to do that as a Godly Man is to
[1:48:14] set the
[1:48:16] example don't come on a Saturday night
[1:48:18] and say to your wife are we going to
[1:48:20] church tomorrow you come in the room and
[1:48:22] say we're going to be a church
[1:48:25] tomorrow somebody said what if they're
[1:48:27] not born again that's every more the
[1:48:29] reason to gather in his name until he
[1:48:31] gets a hold of your heart so when are we
[1:48:34] to teach our children all the time when
[1:48:36] you sit down talk about the Lord when
[1:48:40] you walk by the way talk about the Lord
[1:48:42] when you lie down talk about the Lord
[1:48:45] and when you get
[1:48:47] up talk about the Lord these
[1:48:51] Commandments that word commandment is
[1:48:54] instruction and it's our responsibility
[1:48:57] to speak of the instructions of the Lord
[1:48:59] to our children now let me ask you a
[1:49:01] question a Dad is working at least 40
[1:49:04] hours a week and sometime a whole lot
[1:49:07] more that doesn't negate his
[1:49:09] responsibility to speak to his children
[1:49:11] about the Lord I know men even in this
[1:49:14] house that not only work a full-time job
[1:49:18] but bear a big part in the
[1:49:20] responsibility to homeschool their
[1:49:22] children I want to tell you that's a
[1:49:24] real
[1:49:25] dad you know who you are that's a real
[1:49:29] dad one that will come home after a long
[1:49:31] day of work and still take the
[1:49:34] responsibility of helping to homeschool
[1:49:36] the children my I hope I remember to
[1:49:39] mention that again on Father's Day it's
[1:49:43] commendable it's admirable it's worth
[1:49:46] celebrating but most of that
[1:49:48] responsibility falls on a mother because
[1:49:51] she's home
[1:49:53] and she's with her children day in and
[1:49:56] day out and I want you to know something
[1:49:59] you need to know that you can carry
[1:50:01] through and follow through on your
[1:50:04] responsibility to your own children
[1:50:07] before you take on the responsibility of
[1:50:09] educating other people's
[1:50:11] children it's very important I know we
[1:50:15] share I know we're a village I know we
[1:50:18] stand up for one another and we help one
[1:50:21] another along the way but I also want
[1:50:23] you to understand that that the load of
[1:50:26] that is on you and you should be praised
[1:50:29] you should be commended for taking that
[1:50:32] responsibility if you let the world do
[1:50:39] it they may come home and tell you I'm a
[1:50:46] cat and that's when you tell them cats
[1:50:48] live in the
[1:50:51] yard not in the house I read an article
[1:50:55] about a y young person who said this
[1:50:58] thing he got this on him at school he
[1:51:00] didn't get that on him at
[1:51:04] home he got that devil on him in a
[1:51:06] public school
[1:51:08] surrounding and he come home and he's a
[1:51:10] cat and he's bought him a
[1:51:13] costume and he's dressed and they call
[1:51:15] him
[1:51:16] furries don't get sister Beth poke
[1:51:18] started on
[1:51:20] that she she was shocked to find out it
[1:51:23] was a real thing
[1:51:25] Furies you got boys you got girls and
[1:51:27] you got
[1:51:28] Furies and they think they're animals
[1:51:32] and this one boy insisted on a litter
[1:51:36] box and he wasn't the only one in that
[1:51:39] house that had a mental problem
[1:51:41] evidently mother did
[1:51:43] too cuz she bought him a litter
[1:51:46] box I'm going to tell you something I
[1:51:48] think the line ought to be
[1:51:51] drawn I don't see a Godly mother doing
[1:51:53] that come on and so you if you send them
[1:51:57] to Egypt they're going to be raised like
[1:52:02] Egyptians I've been saying that for for
[1:52:05] 40
[1:52:06] years well that's not directed at
[1:52:08] anybody that's just nothing but the
[1:52:10] truth you know in this day when this
[1:52:13] scripture was spoken it was taught to
[1:52:15] the to the Jewish women the Hebrew women
[1:52:18] it it's your responsibility to teach
[1:52:19] these things to your children and I used
[1:52:22] to always say as an example they didn't
[1:52:24] get all the children together after
[1:52:25] escaping Egypt and put them on a school
[1:52:27] bus and send them back down to Egypt to
[1:52:29] get their education and then wait on
[1:52:31] them to come home every day no when God
[1:52:33] delivered them out of Egypt they were
[1:52:34] free from that stuff I'm thankful today
[1:52:38] for every one of you sisters who serve
[1:52:41] in the public school system you're the
[1:52:42] only hope you don't have to be you don't
[1:52:45] have to be a Jesus
[1:52:47] nut you don't have to break laws and
[1:52:50] rules all you have to do is
[1:52:54] shine amen you don't have to proide or
[1:52:57] evangelize you just shine over there
[1:53:00] because your dress and the way you
[1:53:03] conduct yourself the way you treat
[1:53:05] people will shine to a world that is so
[1:53:09] dark and so lost if you
[1:53:13] can you do the you do the teaching
[1:53:16] Mother if you can you bear that
[1:53:19] responsibility and for those of you who
[1:53:21] do you you are to be
[1:53:24] praised a husband ought to come home and
[1:53:26] say to his wife thank you so much you're
[1:53:29] you're not just loving our children in
[1:53:31] word but you're giving
[1:53:34] everything
[1:53:36] everything it's not easy I've seen my
[1:53:40] wife spending
[1:53:41] hours not with our children after she
[1:53:45] had taught our children spend hours
[1:53:48] trying to learn the concept of
[1:53:50] geometry algebra that they were going to
[1:53:53] need the next day she had to learn it
[1:53:55] for herself because she had to teach it
[1:53:58] the next day that's commendable and
[1:54:01] that's what people have to do in a
[1:54:03] situation like that so we're talking all
[1:54:05] the time to about the things of the Lord
[1:54:08] now I want to take a section of this
[1:54:10] sermon this morning the time I have and
[1:54:13] I want to talk about the
[1:54:15] threefold prophetic purpose of
[1:54:18] prayer because one of the biggest things
[1:54:22] that a mother can do for her children is
[1:54:25] to pray for
[1:54:26] them and the song said that prayer is
[1:54:30] more powerful than an atomic bomb
[1:54:32] brother brandham said that about prayer
[1:54:34] in general that it's the most powerful
[1:54:37] weapon known to man prayer and prayer is
[1:54:41] not just a privilege it's a
[1:54:44] responsibility I want to say that again
[1:54:46] to all of you brother and sister Mama
[1:54:48] and Dad whoever you are prayer is not
[1:54:52] just a blessing and a privilege it's not
[1:54:54] a Santa Claus
[1:54:55] list it's not just begging for your
[1:54:58] wants and needs but prayer has a purpose
[1:55:02] and as I see it in the scripture there
[1:55:05] are many purposes of prayer but I'm not
[1:55:08] talking about just generic prayer I'm
[1:55:10] talking about prophetic prayer prophetic
[1:55:13] prayer is praying with a spiritual
[1:55:17] Insight letting God speak to you as you
[1:55:21] pray
[1:55:22] let him direct your thoughts as you pray
[1:55:27] this is not witchcraft prayer witchcraft
[1:55:30] prayers are
[1:55:31] manipulation and we're still praying
[1:55:33] them sometime when you pray a prayer
[1:55:37] against someone's will and you pray for
[1:55:41] their will to be changed it's
[1:55:45] manipulation the most prayer that you
[1:55:48] can pray in that direction is that they
[1:55:50] would come to their senses
[1:55:53] and receive the Lord's salvation because
[1:55:56] that changes a lot of things but you
[1:55:59] have you have no business in their
[1:56:02] will so if you're praying to change
[1:56:05] somebody's will back off of that that's
[1:56:08] not a that's not a strategic or
[1:56:10] prophetic prayer it's a prayer of
[1:56:13] manipulation when you look at a person
[1:56:16] or a situation and you decide on your
[1:56:19] own how things ought to go
[1:56:22] listen to me and you pray
[1:56:27] accordingly that's not a holy spirit
[1:56:29] driven prayer it's a manipulative prayer
[1:56:33] it's actually Witchcraft and it's not to
[1:56:36] take place in the body of Christ you and
[1:56:39] I may think we know what would be
[1:56:43] best and then they come and ask us
[1:56:45] sometime what would we best what would
[1:56:47] be best and we we're
[1:56:50] speechless well I don't know do what you
[1:56:52] want to do do what you think you should
[1:56:54] do after we've spent 30 minutes in
[1:56:56] prayer telling God to make them do what
[1:56:58] we wanted them to do that's not how
[1:57:01] prayer Works prayer especially prophetic
[1:57:05] prayer is to discover the mind of God
[1:57:08] you want to pray the mind of God because
[1:57:11] we know that whatever Heaven is binding
[1:57:14] we have authority to bind on the earth
[1:57:16] and whatever Heaven is loosing we have
[1:57:19] power to loose that on the earth we're
[1:57:21] not controlling heaven heaven is
[1:57:23] controlling us if we yield to the
[1:57:25] leadership of Eternity and so the spirit
[1:57:28] of God will direct your prayer and lead
[1:57:31] your prayer uh brother gy understands
[1:57:34] and appreciates that because that's how
[1:57:36] God uses him often times and uses some
[1:57:39] of you many of you that way you start
[1:57:42] praying for somebody and and the Very
[1:57:44] words that come out of your mouth are
[1:57:47] directional words God is using that
[1:57:50] prayer to give them insight
[1:57:53] you're just praying but God is putting
[1:57:55] words he's creating words in your mouth
[1:57:59] and you don't realize the prophetic
[1:58:01] power that releasing that that
[1:58:05] Revelation and you can pray that over
[1:58:06] your children I believe with all my
[1:58:08] heart that yoked did that I believe she
[1:58:11] laid hands on that little baby's head
[1:58:13] and prayed him into his purpose and
[1:58:16] therefore she didn't have to worry about
[1:58:18] a
[1:58:19] crocodile because she knew there weren't
[1:58:21] enough crocodiles in the Nile River to
[1:58:23] keep him from meeting his purpose if you
[1:58:26] have thoroughly covered your children
[1:58:28] with prayer you don't have to
[1:58:30] worry there's not enough crocodiles in
[1:58:33] the river to get them out of their
[1:58:35] purpose
[1:58:36] forever they may be pulled in One
[1:58:38] Direction or the other the Bible said
[1:58:41] raise up a child train a child in the
[1:58:45] way he should go and when he is old he
[1:58:47] will not depart now that the King James
[1:58:50] fails
[1:58:53] I know there are critics watching who
[1:58:55] say see he he's bashing the King James
[1:58:58] no in most cases it's the B Most Blessed
[1:59:02] and most accurate but that is really a
[1:59:06] little different translation from what
[1:59:09] the original language says there if you
[1:59:11] were to take that from the original it
[1:59:13] doesn't say train up a child and he'll
[1:59:16] never get away from that
[1:59:17] training when he's old he'll come back
[1:59:20] it actually says and while he is growing
[1:59:24] old train up a child in the way he
[1:59:26] should go and while he is growing old he
[1:59:29] will not depart from it so God has a
[1:59:33] time he has a season he has a place for
[1:59:37] your children I'm talking to mothers for
[1:59:39] just a moment here mama I don't care
[1:59:41] where they are right
[1:59:44] now you may be sitting here thinking
[1:59:47] that you know he could have sent me a
[1:59:50] flower she could could have done such
[1:59:52] and such and such instead she's off with
[1:59:56] her husband's mother or some other
[1:59:59] person's mother and they missed their
[2:00:01] opportunity to be with me I agree it
[2:00:04] seems unfair but I want you to know it
[2:00:06] doesn't matter where they are they may
[2:00:09] be somewhere nursing the biggest
[2:00:10] hangover of their life this morning they
[2:00:13] might not have wanted you to see them
[2:00:15] looking like they look this morning but
[2:00:17] I want you to know that if you have
[2:00:19] thoroughly covered them in prayer and
[2:00:22] you are in in agreement with God's
[2:00:24] purposes for their life and you have
[2:00:26] prophesied that into
[2:00:28] eternity they you may never see them
[2:00:31] brother you don't have to see them to
[2:00:33] have great influence in their life
[2:00:35] because a mother has that gift to be
[2:00:37] able to pray prophetically if you'll
[2:00:39] yield to it and and I want you to know
[2:00:42] Destinies are corrected when a Godly
[2:00:45] mother stands in faith she cannot be
[2:00:48] moved by what she sees she can can not
[2:00:52] be moved by what she hears she's got to
[2:00:55] have her faith anchored on the solid
[2:00:58] rock and no matter how they live or what
[2:01:01] they do or what they say when they're
[2:01:05] away from God their words can be so
[2:01:07] harsh and so cutting and if a mother
[2:01:11] lets her heart be wounded by that she'll
[2:01:14] loosen her grip on her faith don't you
[2:01:18] you pray I pray for you right now that
[2:01:21] God God would so protect your heart and
[2:01:24] so Shield your heart that you would
[2:01:27] realize that it's not your children it's
[2:01:30] a spirit that has taken a hold of them
[2:01:33] they're not in Rebellion against you
[2:01:35] they're in Rebellion against God and God
[2:01:38] knows how to get them he knows how to
[2:01:41] draw them to hisself you don't be moved
[2:01:46] by what you see or he keep your faith
[2:01:49] anchored in that Solid Rock and God
[2:01:52] knows how amen so I I I want to get to
[2:01:57] this I chose three there could be many
[2:02:00] more prophetic purposes of prayer I
[2:02:03] chose three because of Ecclesiastes 4:12
[2:02:07] and if one Prevail against him two shall
[2:02:10] withstand him and a three-fold cord is
[2:02:13] not quickly broken I want you to know
[2:02:15] there's power there's power in agreement
[2:02:19] and there's power when when any two or
[2:02:21] more
[2:02:22] agree and this talks to us about uh the
[2:02:25] the authority of three the power of
[2:02:30] three and so I chose three and uh here
[2:02:35] it is in Ezekiel I want to show you the
[2:02:37] three things in Ezekiel chap 22 verse 30
[2:02:41] and 31 some will recognize this teaching
[2:02:44] from a from a prayer meeting that we did
[2:02:47] some years ago in the daytime and I
[2:02:50] sought A man among them them that should
[2:02:53] make up the Hedge and stand in the gap
[2:02:57] before me for the land that I should not
[2:03:00] destroy it and what does he
[2:03:02] say but I found none therefore have I
[2:03:06] poured out my indignation upon them I
[2:03:10] have consumed them with the fire of my
[2:03:13] wrath their own way have I recompensed
[2:03:16] upon their heads sayeth the Lord God I
[2:03:19] don't have to tell you this morning how
[2:03:21] how powerful the book of of Ezekiel is
[2:03:25] Ezekiel was an interesting prophet he
[2:03:28] carried a particular anointing and there
[2:03:32] are there are things in the Book of
[2:03:34] Ezekiel that are coming to pass
[2:03:36] sometimes it's like reading the
[2:03:38] newspaper or hearing the news especially
[2:03:42] pertaining to the nation of Israel
[2:03:44] Ezekiel was given stay with me he was
[2:03:48] given a particular anointing to prophesy
[2:03:51] even into our day I want you to think
[2:03:54] about that a prophet uh misunderstood in
[2:03:58] his own generation and yet his word
[2:04:01] still coming to pass today and he said I
[2:04:05] sought for a man among them I sought for
[2:04:08] someone there's neither male nor female
[2:04:11] with God I'm using this for mothers but
[2:04:14] I want you to know every man woman boy
[2:04:16] or girl has a responsibility in prayer I
[2:04:19] said a responsibility
[2:04:22] the church isn't praying enough if we
[2:04:24] were praying enough we would seem even
[2:04:26] more
[2:04:28] accomplished it wouldn't be behind the
[2:04:30] scenes then did you know that true
[2:04:33] prayer among us if it should catch out
[2:04:35] like a fire among us we would pull the
[2:04:37] things that God is doing behind the
[2:04:39] scene we'd pull it right out in the
[2:04:41] open where we could see it how many of
[2:04:44] you'd like to see some oldfashioned
[2:04:47] Deliverance Prayer is what moves God in
[2:04:51] certain directions you're not directing
[2:04:53] God but prayer gives God Liberty he is a
[2:04:57] gentleman he's not going to break in on
[2:05:00] your agenda but when you pray for his
[2:05:03] agenda to be done not my will sir but
[2:05:07] thy will be done I want to tell you
[2:05:10] something there are too many of us in
[2:05:12] this room that most of our prayers are
[2:05:15] for
[2:05:19] ourselves now that's not intercession
[2:05:22] that's just straight out
[2:05:24] selfishness come on and when I say that
[2:05:27] I don't mean God make me what I ought to
[2:05:29] be I mean Lord bless this and bless that
[2:05:32] and do this and do that and do the
[2:05:35] other and help me in mine let me tell
[2:05:39] you something we not only have a
[2:05:40] responsibility to our own but we have a
[2:05:43] responsibility to the body I'm
[2:05:46] preaching you might not be listening but
[2:05:48] I'm preaching now number one one one of
[2:05:52] the three-fold prophetic purposes of
[2:05:54] prayer is to I call it hedge
[2:05:57] building to build a hedge he said I
[2:06:01] sought for a man among them that should
[2:06:03] make up the Hedge a hedge is a
[2:06:07] protective wall that keeps enemies out
[2:06:10] the word hedge means to surround with a
[2:06:13] fence or a wall to protect to set anyone
[2:06:17] who is in trouble distress or danger in
[2:06:20] a safe place to keep out of the enemies
[2:06:24] excuse me to keep out the enemies of the
[2:06:26] vineyard the flock the house the city
[2:06:31] the family the church God gives us a
[2:06:34] responsibility in prophetic prayer to
[2:06:37] build up a hedge to raise up a hedge
[2:06:41] because the enemy desires to tear down
[2:06:44] every
[2:06:45] hedge he wants to leave the body
[2:06:49] defenseless he wants to leave leave us
[2:06:52] entirely vulnerable to the spirit of the
[2:06:55] age it's up to the prayer
[2:06:58] warriors it's up to mothers to do this
[2:07:02] in their own
[2:07:04] family I'm going to drink some water
[2:07:06] while you pinch yourself to stay
[2:07:11] awake it's up to mothers to build
[2:07:15] Hedges that's why you need to be at home
[2:07:22] it's up to mothers to build Hedges of
[2:07:25] protection around their families now
[2:07:28] that doesn't mean dad has no
[2:07:30] responsibility but remember mother has a
[2:07:32] gift if mother will yield to that gift
[2:07:36] we're Walling something in and when we
[2:07:39] hedge something in we're shutting
[2:07:41] something out Job chapter 1 9 and 10
[2:07:45] then Satan answered the Lord and said
[2:07:47] that job fear God for not Hast not thou
[2:07:51] made a hedge about him God is a hedge
[2:07:53] Builder it's up to you and I to keep it
[2:07:55] in place do you hear that and about the
[2:07:59] house and about all that he hath on
[2:08:01] every side thou Hast blessed the work of
[2:08:04] his hands and his substance is increased
[2:08:06] in the land so it was God who built a
[2:08:08] hedge around job but the enemy's desire
[2:08:11] was to come in and you know God led
[2:08:15] him God led him and job and his
[2:08:19] distraction
[2:08:22] he got
[2:08:23] distracted I know we talk about some of
[2:08:25] the faithful words that come out of his
[2:08:28] mouth we talk about the fact that you
[2:08:30] know he oh that I could write that my
[2:08:32] redeemer liveth and we know that he said
[2:08:35] to his wife she told him just Curse God
[2:08:38] and die he said you talk like a foolish
[2:08:40] woman but I want you to know he his
[2:08:42] afflictions distracted him he needed
[2:08:46] somebody to help build keep the Hedge in
[2:08:50] place to to raise it up when the Hedge
[2:08:53] is broken down it allows satanic
[2:08:56] harassment in and around those areas
[2:08:59] that especially needs spiritual
[2:09:01] protection and a mother has a particular
[2:09:05] responsibility as the children are
[2:09:07] growing up to keep that hedge in place
[2:09:12] she has a responsibility I'm going to
[2:09:14] wait on
[2:09:16] you she has a responsibility to monitor
[2:09:20] what her children put before their
[2:09:23] eyes your eye gate is one of one of the
[2:09:26] most powerful Gates into your soul the
[2:09:29] eye gate and you've got to guard that
[2:09:32] eye gate at all cost yes sir and you
[2:09:34] know just because they're too young to
[2:09:37] understand what you're
[2:09:40] watching doesn't mean that it doesn't
[2:09:43] have an influence over them in another
[2:09:47] realm it certainly does you let one
[2:09:51] person disrespect the things of
[2:09:54] God you let one person think it's all
[2:09:57] right to stand in here and talk when the
[2:09:59] service is dismissed you let one person
[2:10:02] think they're the exception to the rule
[2:10:05] and the next thing you know somebody
[2:10:06] else will do it and somebody else will
[2:10:09] do it because they justified in their
[2:10:12] mind by saying she does it I want you to
[2:10:15] know we wouldn't have near the trouble
[2:10:16] we have if we wouldn't worry about what
[2:10:18] somebody else gets by with if we just
[2:10:22] worry about hearing the Lord for
[2:10:23] ourselves and if we'd worry about making
[2:10:26] sure the Hedge is is secure around those
[2:10:29] we love our responsibility doesn't stop
[2:10:32] with our house it goes to our extended
[2:10:35] family help me now and it goes to the
[2:10:38] body of Christ it goes to
[2:10:41] nhrm it goes to New Hope Revival
[2:10:44] ministries we're raising up and keeping
[2:10:46] a hedge in place that God is the one who
[2:10:49] built it it was his promise to keep our
[2:10:52] children but it's our responsibility to
[2:10:55] make sure you sit them down in a room
[2:10:57] where you're playing I'm going to I'm
[2:10:58] going to just hit this I'm not going to
[2:11:01] be with nobody the rest of the day I'm
[2:11:02] just going home with
[2:11:04] mine I'm not going to be fellowshipping
[2:11:07] with anybody the rest of the day so I'm
[2:11:08] just going to say what needs to be said
[2:11:10] this morning and go home and sit by
[2:11:12] myself so I don't need your handshake
[2:11:15] this morning
[2:11:19] brother the truth is the truth we set
[2:11:23] them down in front or allowed them to
[2:11:24] play in a room where we're watching
[2:11:26] something that shouldn't be watched
[2:11:28] playing a game that we shouldn't play
[2:11:30] doing something that we shouldn't do
[2:11:32] reading some old True Crime book or some
[2:11:36] uh you know Grisham or Clancy or or
[2:11:39] what's the weird
[2:11:42] one the
[2:11:44] horer king we sit in a room and read
[2:11:48] some kind of stuff like that and we
[2:11:50] don't realize
[2:11:52] that in the room those kinds of
[2:11:54] influences emit
[2:11:58] something let me tell you something you
[2:12:01] let one person in a house uh spend time
[2:12:04] in
[2:12:05] pornography and it releases a spirit
[2:12:07] over the entire
[2:12:10] house you see we don't know enough about
[2:12:12] how that other realm operates but once
[2:12:15] we do we'll become a little fanatical
[2:12:17] about it I'm a little bit fanatical
[2:12:19] about it I understand one person's
[2:12:22] influence over another I understand how
[2:12:24] Spirits call out and cry out brother
[2:12:27] brandom tried to teach us that he said
[2:12:29] what's that well I said that Spirit on
[2:12:31] that person there is calling out to this
[2:12:33] other person over here who has the same
[2:12:35] problem he's calling in for
[2:12:38] reinforcements now you know if demons
[2:12:40] can call in reinforcements then we ought
[2:12:42] to have a little authority to do such a
[2:12:44] thing Lord I need some reinforcements in
[2:12:47] here I need some amens in here I need
[2:12:50] some angels help in here and I'm not
[2:12:53] commanding angels I'm asking the Lord
[2:12:55] you the Lord he's the Lord of hosts he's
[2:12:57] the one who commands Angel armies Lord
[2:13:00] I'm asking you if it Be Your Will and
[2:13:02] according to your plan send me some of
[2:13:04] my angels send me some help I have a
[2:13:08] responsibility here to to build this
[2:13:11] hedge to make sure Ecclesiastes 108 he
[2:13:15] that dith the pit I'm hurrying he that
[2:13:17] dith the pit shall fall into it and who
[2:13:19] so break a hedge a serpent shall bite in
[2:13:22] you really want to dig a pit for
[2:13:23] somebody else you really want to sneak
[2:13:26] in and tear somebody else's heads down
[2:13:28] you really want people to get what they
[2:13:32] deserve I've heard Christian people
[2:13:35] say people that I know and love say well
[2:13:39] he just getting what he
[2:13:40] deserves she's just getting what she
[2:13:42] deserves look bud what if you
[2:13:46] did look what if you what if you
[2:13:49] did what if if you got what you deserved
[2:13:53] let me tell you something God didn't
[2:13:54] call you uh to be that kind of a you
[2:13:56] know uh gainsayer he called you to be
[2:13:59] someone who helps build up a hedge
[2:14:01] around them I'm driving back forces of
[2:14:03] the enemy in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:14:06] I'm commanding you to take your hands
[2:14:08] off of my children I'm command come on
[2:14:11] somebody said you'll sound like a nut
[2:14:13] well I didn't tell you to get on street
[2:14:14] corner and do
[2:14:15] it I didn't tell you to stand out by the
[2:14:18] side of the road and do it you do it by
[2:14:21] by yourself if you have to and that's
[2:14:23] why you need to be able to pray in
[2:14:25] another
[2:14:28] tongue you need to yield to that kind of
[2:14:31] a thing because sometimes we're so
[2:14:33] emotionally involved in a situation we
[2:14:35] don't know what to say we're almost
[2:14:38] embarrassed to pray you let the spirit
[2:14:42] woo take that you
[2:14:45] [Applause]
[2:14:46] preachers you let the spirit begin to
[2:14:49] intercede I tell you he never misses the
[2:14:52] mark he knows what we
[2:14:55] need amen don't don't dig a pit don't
[2:14:58] try to break somebody else's hedge down
[2:15:01] Isaiah 55 and now go to I will tell you
[2:15:04] what I will do to my Vineyard I will
[2:15:05] take away the Hedge thereof it shall be
[2:15:08] eaten up and break down the wall thereof
[2:15:10] and it shall be trotten down this is God
[2:15:13] telling us through the prophet Isaiah
[2:15:15] I'm about to deal with Israel and the
[2:15:17] first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
[2:15:19] to take down the Hedge oh
[2:15:21] and I'm going to allow the enemy to come
[2:15:23] in and eat up the
[2:15:26] grapes so this is the importance of
[2:15:29] keeping a hedge in place and we do that
[2:15:33] with prophetic
[2:15:34] prayer Psalm 30 excuse me Psalm 812 why
[2:15:38] hast thou then broken down her hedges so
[2:15:40] that they all which pass by the way do
[2:15:43] pluck her we've got a Vineyard to
[2:15:46] protect we've got fruit to hold on to
[2:15:49] come on is there anybody in here that
[2:15:51] raised your children and wanted them to
[2:15:53] go I hear people ignorantly saying
[2:15:55] stupid
[2:15:56] things I hear people sometimes saying
[2:15:59] well they'll never be able to appreciate
[2:16:00] what it means to find the grace of God
[2:16:02] unless they go out there and sin sleep
[2:16:04] around and do the
[2:16:06] thing you have no more confidence in
[2:16:09] your God than
[2:16:11] that don't you know that God is able if
[2:16:14] you keep the Hedge up he's able to make
[2:16:16] sure they don't even fall into the
[2:16:18] desire
[2:16:21] for the things of the
[2:16:23] world you raise them to be worshippers
[2:16:25] that's right these little bitty children
[2:16:28] raise them to be worshippers and rebuke
[2:16:32] anybody that tells you they don't know
[2:16:33] what they're
[2:16:35] doing if you believe what I believe
[2:16:37] you'll believe that way before we were
[2:16:39] where we are we were in the presence of
[2:16:42] God in his mind at least dancing before
[2:16:46] him at least in his mind sir right the
[2:16:52] Book of Job doesn't say in his
[2:16:54] mind but at least we're going to say in
[2:16:57] his mind we came from a place of Praise
[2:17:01] so when your little children find that
[2:17:03] place of worship they're just actually
[2:17:05] fulfilling and doing what they were sent
[2:17:07] here to do what they were created to do
[2:17:09] in the first place and if they have
[2:17:11] Liberty now by the grace of God they
[2:17:14] don't have to lose it when they're
[2:17:18] teenagers it's hard it's hard you you
[2:17:21] can't raise them any way you want to and
[2:17:23] then bring them to a place like this and
[2:17:25] expect a place like this to fix
[2:17:29] everything no in fact what we can do and
[2:17:33] the only thing we can do sometime is say
[2:17:35] Lord I have made some big old
[2:17:37] mistakes but I want you to redeem the
[2:17:42] time forgive me for my slackness if
[2:17:46] there was slackness on my part forgive
[2:17:49] me Lord and redeem the time I want my
[2:17:51] children
[2:17:53] programmed by the spirit to worship God
[2:17:59] to serve God we sing they that wait upon
[2:18:03] the Lord that doesn't mean sit and do
[2:18:04] nothing that word wait means to serve
[2:18:08] those who serve God those who serve him
[2:18:10] waiting on the promise you don't you
[2:18:12] don't wait till the promise comes to
[2:18:14] praise him you serve him until the
[2:18:17] promise becomes a reality so we're wall
[2:18:20] build ERS we're hedge
[2:18:23] repairers do you understand we there's
[2:18:26] always going to be Nehemiah chapter 4
[2:18:29] I'm not going to read it for time verses
[2:18:32] 6-9 but it talks about a sand balad and
[2:18:36] a Tobias I want you to know there's
[2:18:39] always going to be sand balads and
[2:18:41] Tobias that seek out the gaps or the
[2:18:44] breaches in the wall which provide
[2:18:47] Avenues or ways for the enemy to enter
[2:18:50] the city but that's all right because
[2:18:52] there's always going to be a holy ghost
[2:18:55] intercessor man or woman there's always
[2:18:58] going to be some Watchman on the wall
[2:18:59] man or woman who are praying to repair
[2:19:02] those breaches to raise up those broken
[2:19:05] down
[2:19:06] walls and then it goes on and let me say
[2:19:10] this we must be able to recognize the
[2:19:12] neglected and broken down areas that
[2:19:15] Satan has used to gain access into our
[2:19:17] lives and be willing to invest our time
[2:19:19] in prayer and prophetic decreeing of the
[2:19:23] word to repair and to rebuild the the
[2:19:27] hedges and the walls that God has put in
[2:19:31] place the prophet said I'm looking for a
[2:19:34] man among them to make up the Hedge and
[2:19:36] to do
[2:19:37] what to stand in the Gap we need gap
[2:19:41] standers we need people who will find
[2:19:44] the vulnerability in the wall mothers
[2:19:47] too who find the vulnerability in the
[2:19:50] wall and you go stand in
[2:19:54] it you go put your finger in the in the
[2:19:57] in the hole in the
[2:19:59] Dyke you'll go find where it's leaking
[2:20:01] out and you'll go plug it up and you'll
[2:20:04] put your faith there I'm putting my
[2:20:06] faith
[2:20:07] yeaha I'm putting my faith in that
[2:20:11] hole I'm putting my faith in that
[2:20:16] Gap I'm not going to see it and and
[2:20:19] celebrate it
[2:20:21] I'm going to go stand in
[2:20:23] it sometimes we have a
[2:20:26] problem when we see the the places of of
[2:20:30] of
[2:20:31] Gap we have a tendency to call attention
[2:20:35] to
[2:20:36] it with
[2:20:48] gossip that's not what a gap standard
[2:20:51] does a gap Stander is not someone who
[2:20:54] sees a gap and goes pointing at it hey
[2:20:56] hey hey hey look here look at this place
[2:21:01] where they're vulnerable where they're
[2:21:02] not doing what they're supposed to do
[2:21:06] no there are too many people I've said
[2:21:08] this many times I believe there's a
[2:21:10] spirit behind it there are too many
[2:21:12] people that'll step over a piece of
[2:21:16] trash there's too many people I thank
[2:21:18] God we don't have this much snow there's
[2:21:20] too many people that will shovel the sow
[2:21:22] snow off their stoop that they share
[2:21:24] with the
[2:21:27] neighbor there's too many people that'll
[2:21:29] cut their grass and they get down there
[2:21:31] to the road where the where the yards
[2:21:33] kind of come close and they wouldn't
[2:21:34] dare think
[2:21:36] of I'm not telling you to cut your
[2:21:38] neighbor's
[2:21:39] yard but if you share a little space
[2:21:41] down there by the mailbox it wouldn't
[2:21:43] hurt you to be the
[2:21:45] one there's a spirit behind some of
[2:21:48] those behaviors in a house when you drop
[2:21:51] something pick it up don't wait on Mama
[2:21:55] I'll give Mama a little help don't wait
[2:21:57] on Mama to pick it up you pick it
[2:22:03] up you know I'm going to say this I'll
[2:22:05] get in
[2:22:06] trouble all my kids we you know we've
[2:22:09] put Benjamin up the hill with his little
[2:22:11] wife in
[2:22:12] life and the other three were going to
[2:22:15] camp and you know what my wife went
[2:22:18] through the house and she did the most
[2:22:20] amazing thorough cleaning of the house
[2:22:22] and we found out that you don't even
[2:22:24] have to do it every day if the kids are
[2:22:30] gone I wipe down my counter she wiped
[2:22:33] down hers and and the girls I can see
[2:22:35] them sometime they look so weary cuz
[2:22:37] they help a lot they do they help a lot
[2:22:40] but they do look sometimes weary doing
[2:22:43] it and they didn't like it when we told
[2:22:46] them they come home they did not like it
[2:22:47] when we told them you know why because
[2:22:50] no nobody left anything on the dining
[2:22:52] room even even mother and I have to be
[2:22:53] honest my wife does sometime I got to be
[2:22:55] real real cuz my girls are listening
[2:22:58] sometimes mama has so much to do that
[2:23:01] sometimes she'll leave something on the
[2:23:02] dining room table but we found out that
[2:23:05] it's easy to keep up with your own
[2:23:07] things and put your own things away when
[2:23:09] you don't have to be busy putting
[2:23:10] somebody else's things away come
[2:23:14] on
[2:23:15] mhm I just said recently to to one of
[2:23:18] them you would you please move such a
[2:23:20] that's not mine I said I don't I don't
[2:23:24] care they were kidding thankfully and
[2:23:26] they got it done we we there's Spirits
[2:23:29] behind that kind of
[2:23:31] behavior so if you see something that
[2:23:34] needs to be picked up pick it
[2:23:38] up if you have to if you have to get out
[2:23:40] and move a scooter to drive why don't
[2:23:42] you go ahead and put it in a safe
[2:23:44] place it's aggravating believe me I
[2:23:47] know I know it used to bother Nathan
[2:23:49] still does us for people to leave things
[2:23:51] well they just do it and they're going
[2:23:53] to folks leave their
[2:23:54] dishes we used to have folks come over
[2:23:57] and stay at our house and still do
[2:23:58] sometime and oh my goodness the things
[2:24:00] they
[2:24:02] leave I hope I hope one of the kiners
[2:24:04] listens to
[2:24:06] this we sometimes have to box their
[2:24:09] stuff up in a box and send it to them
[2:24:11] there's so much of it it won't go in an
[2:24:13] envelope it's got to be boxed
[2:24:15] up you got to learn to keep up with your
[2:24:18] stuff naturally and
[2:24:20] spiritually we've got to learn we're not
[2:24:23] celebrating someone's lack where they've
[2:24:25] let the bar down we're going over and
[2:24:28] finding that spot putting oursel right
[2:24:30] in the midst in Hebrew a gap represents
[2:24:33] a rupture or a breach there's a breach
[2:24:36] in the wall we need a Godly
[2:24:38] mother we need a Godly Mama to go stand
[2:24:41] in that breach of the wall and hold up
[2:24:44] that spot I tell you the enemy that's
[2:24:47] been running in and out of there when he
[2:24:48] looks up and sees a mama's Faith
[2:24:50] standing there he'll tuck his head and
[2:24:53] tail when heav when Mama Prayed Heaven
[2:24:56] pays attention when a with the effectual
[2:24:59] fervent prayer of a righteous man or a
[2:25:02] righteous woman availeth much from a
[2:25:06] military context it's known that a
[2:25:08] besieging army would continuously attack
[2:25:11] a specific place in the wall of a city
[2:25:14] and then with United Force the enemy uh
[2:25:16] Army would rush the wall causing a
[2:25:19] breach or a break first they would
[2:25:21] weaken that
[2:25:22] spot Ram it and RAM it and that how the
[2:25:25] devil does RAM it and RAM brother Shel
[2:25:28] I'm having hard time following your
[2:25:29] Mother's Day May I'm sorry I'm trying to
[2:25:30] get everybody in here the enemy will RAM
[2:25:33] and RAM and RAM and RAM and RAM the wall
[2:25:36] he'll shake the mortar out of its
[2:25:38] place that's the place he's going to
[2:25:40] come in that's a place you and I need to
[2:25:43] be standing come on don't you get upset
[2:25:46] with me if if I say to somebody you need
[2:25:49] to correct something
[2:25:50] don't you be upset with me that's part
[2:25:52] of my responsibility because if the
[2:25:54] enemy can't get this church one way
[2:25:56] he'll get us
[2:25:58] another if he can't attack us one way
[2:26:00] he'll attack us another and he'll use
[2:26:02] compromise in this
[2:26:06] hour he'll let a Spirit come right in
[2:26:08] here Among Us and it'll catch on I'm
[2:26:10] telling you it'll catch
[2:26:14] on you let those skirts get shorter and
[2:26:16] shorter and that thing will catch on
[2:26:19] with somebody else if it's my
[2:26:23] responsibility I'm going to be a gap
[2:26:25] Stander if it hair lips the devil and
[2:26:28] bankrupts
[2:26:29] hell and if I can if if God will let me
[2:26:32] I can live without your tithe if your
[2:26:34] tithe is that important to you that you
[2:26:37] will try to control what somebody says
[2:26:40] up
[2:26:41] here God knows how to stretch it don't
[2:26:44] he he stretched it for
[2:26:46] you it's recorded in history that in
[2:26:49] this situation often often one or more
[2:26:50] soldiers would have the responsibility
[2:26:53] to sacrifice their lives by physically
[2:26:56] standing in the breach and closing the
[2:26:58] Gap the enemy had made in the wall in
[2:27:01] the best case scenario the enemy would
[2:27:03] be turned back or at the least
[2:27:05] significantly slowed down by
[2:27:09] soldiers who are standing in the Gap a
[2:27:13] gap standing Soldier was highly
[2:27:15] respected though somewhat rare and a
[2:27:18] name that was sought Out Among the bra
[2:27:20] braest of
[2:27:21] soldiers God needs some
[2:27:24] folks families need some
[2:27:30] mamas there's things that go on in your
[2:27:32] home sometimes sister that you can't
[2:27:35] tell
[2:27:36] anybody but you can tell
[2:27:41] him it's not God's will for wives to be
[2:27:45] mistreated and
[2:27:47] abused that's not godly
[2:27:51] come
[2:27:52] on sometimes things go on like that that
[2:27:55] nobody can
[2:27:57] know can't be
[2:27:59] told but you let a Godly mother go find
[2:28:02] the place cuz she realizes that
[2:28:04] everything that goes on in that home is
[2:28:06] going to affect those
[2:28:07] children what if they don't hear it I
[2:28:09] tell you it will affect them because
[2:28:11] it's a spirit that's
[2:28:14] right it'll affect them in their
[2:28:16] bedrooms you send them away I know
[2:28:19] parents that put their kids with
[2:28:20] earphones on and put them in a room so
[2:28:22] they can
[2:28:22] fight well that's nice of you to go to
[2:28:25] all that trouble but while you're doing
[2:28:26] all of that you could just forgive one
[2:28:29] another and get it worked out if you've
[2:28:31] got time to go put your kids in one room
[2:28:33] and give them
[2:28:34] headphones so you can yell you've got
[2:28:38] time to go one way and send him another
[2:28:39] way and pray it
[2:28:40] through there's going to be
[2:28:47] conflict there is
[2:28:50] we can make a difference through
[2:28:52] prayer I've got to move on the third is
[2:28:55] we're to fill the cup with
[2:28:57] prayer we are to make up the Hedge to
[2:29:02] make sure that the Hedge is repaired we
[2:29:04] are to stand in the Gap when we can't
[2:29:06] build it back we can stand in the Gap
[2:29:08] and make sure the enemy doesn't get
[2:29:10] through it on our watch and then we have
[2:29:12] a responsibility because the cup of
[2:29:14] God's indignation is ever filling the
[2:29:17] cup of God's Wrath is ever filling and
[2:29:20] we have a responsibility to fill the cup
[2:29:22] with prayer before the before the Lord's
[2:29:25] indignation cup is filled and other
[2:29:28] words we have the ability to hold
[2:29:31] back the Judgment of God while our
[2:29:35] families get in and we do that by
[2:29:38] filling up the cup with prayer and
[2:29:40] praise we fill up the bolds with prayer
[2:29:44] while the enemy's cup you know he's
[2:29:46] making sure that the cup of indignation
[2:29:49] God's indignation is filling up the cup
[2:29:51] of God's Wrath we have a responsibility
[2:29:54] to kind of work against that Revelation
[2:29:56] 58 and when he had taken the book The
[2:29:58] Four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell
[2:30:00] down before the lamb having every one of
[2:30:02] them Harps and golden vials and that
[2:30:05] word golden vile there is translated
[2:30:08] from a bowl or a shallow cup full of
[2:30:10] odors full of
[2:30:13] incense which are the
[2:30:16] prayers of the
[2:30:18] Saints did you you know that those
[2:30:22] Elders that sit and stand Before the
[2:30:25] Throne have vials or bowls that are
[2:30:30] filled with the prayers of
[2:30:32] saints and they ever rise like incense
[2:30:37] Before the Throne of God you think your
[2:30:40] little prayer down here don't matter
[2:30:42] well I want you to know it's raising out
[2:30:43] of a
[2:30:45] bowl like
[2:30:47] incense in the hands of 4 and 20 ERS the
[2:30:51] lamb could not forget you if he wanted
[2:30:53] to because your prayers precede you to
[2:30:56] the throne and they're Rising we're in a
[2:31:00] race to fill up the cup of prayer before
[2:31:02] God's Cup of Wrath is filled up Psalm
[2:31:07] 141:2 let my prayer be set forth before
[2:31:09] thee as incense and the lifting up of my
[2:31:12] hands as the evening
[2:31:15] sacrifice Luke 1:9 and 10 according to
[2:31:18] the custom of the priest off office his
[2:31:20] lot was to burn incense when he went
[2:31:22] into the Temple of the Lord talking
[2:31:24] about Zacharias and the whole multitude
[2:31:26] of the people were praying without at
[2:31:28] the time of incense the priests were not
[2:31:31] left alone to do their job
[2:31:34] hello it wasn't just in the hands of the
[2:31:36] preacher to do the praying and the
[2:31:39] praising while that while that priest
[2:31:41] was offering that incense to the Lord as
[2:31:44] a sweet smelling sa the people were were
[2:31:47] without and they were raising up up
[2:31:50] their prayers and their praise to God
[2:31:54] and they were doing it at the same time
[2:31:56] the priest was doing his thing we have a
[2:31:59] responsibility yes sir you can find that
[2:32:03] in fact you can find that in Revelation
[2:32:05] 8 if you look down to verse four and the
[2:32:09] smoke of the incense this is this is
[2:32:12] when he's talking about the seventh seal
[2:32:14] and the smoke of the incense which came
[2:32:16] with the prayers of the Saints ascended
[2:32:18] up before God out of the Angel's hand in
[2:32:20] and the angel took the sensor and filled
[2:32:22] it with fire of the Altar and cast it
[2:32:23] into the Earth and there were voices and
[2:32:25] thunderings and Lightnings and
[2:32:26] earthquakes and the Seven Angels which
[2:32:28] had the seven trumpets prepared
[2:32:29] themselves to sound I want you to know
[2:32:32] that your prayers not only work in this
[2:32:34] realm they have great authority of
[2:32:38] course in another realm and they
[2:32:41] represent themselves Before the Throne
[2:32:44] of God now there's a lot more that I
[2:32:46] could say and would say and and may say
[2:32:49] on that subject subject but I want to I
[2:32:51] want to come to a close by
[2:32:55] this I don't believe there's any
[2:32:58] impossibility when a mother a real
[2:33:00] mother's prayer is being offered to God
[2:33:04] I think God can do things I believe God
[2:33:07] can do things that the world would call
[2:33:10] impossible and I think that God would
[2:33:13] hold all kinds of things in place do all
[2:33:17] kinds of unusual things that would
[2:33:19] affect
[2:33:20] uh the world itself to get your prayer
[2:33:24] answered I believe mothers are Given
[2:33:26] that special gift of faith to pray for
[2:33:28] their children and nobody else can take
[2:33:31] their place in doing it we join our
[2:33:33] faith with
[2:33:34] theirs I want to I want to read you a
[2:33:36] story I I'm doing it this way because I
[2:33:38] want to get the
[2:33:40] details I want to tell you that a real
[2:33:42] mother's faith can ground a plane how
[2:33:45] many of you know that a real mother's
[2:33:47] faith can bring a storm
[2:33:51] that causes an airplane not to take off
[2:33:54] that sends a prophet down through
[2:33:57] downtown
[2:33:58] Memphis puts him at the right place at
[2:34:01] the right time can I read this to you in
[2:34:03] paragraph 98 of a of a message called
[2:34:06] desperations Hannah I want you to listen
[2:34:09] to this if you miss the rest don't miss
[2:34:11] this part Hannah a barren woman in the
[2:34:15] Bible she wanted a son and she got to
[2:34:17] fasting for him and she fasted and
[2:34:20] prayed until even the priest at the
[2:34:22] temple thought she was drunk can you
[2:34:24] imagine can you imagine being in such a
[2:34:26] place of intercession that only your
[2:34:28] lips moved I've been there some of you
[2:34:31] been there that only your lips moved but
[2:34:34] your there was no sound coming out your
[2:34:37] heart was reaching out to God she was so
[2:34:39] desperate she'd been so mocked and
[2:34:42] maligned and she was so desperate before
[2:34:45] God she had prayed and prayed and prayed
[2:34:46] this wasn't her first time of praying
[2:34:49] she had prayed and prayed and prayed and
[2:34:51] this time she felt in fell into so much
[2:34:54] desperation BR said she was in so much
[2:34:57] desperation let's go on with the rest of
[2:34:59] the women watching what kind of Bonnet
[2:35:01] the other one had wore and you know how
[2:35:04] it goes and the other one seeing what
[2:35:06] kind of clothes they had on and talking
[2:35:08] about the things going on on the farm
[2:35:09] you know folks can be silly folks can be
[2:35:12] really
[2:35:15] silly men can be really silly women
[2:35:18] women can be really
[2:35:24] silly don't matter what kind of Bonnet
[2:35:27] somebody else
[2:35:29] wears Benjamin is not in here but oh yes
[2:35:32] that grandbaby is going to wear a bonnet
[2:35:34] at least once in her
[2:35:37] life her mama said so and her p pap said
[2:35:41] so you don't have to do it every day but
[2:35:44] I want to see one Bonnet
[2:35:46] owner women uh you know word about some
[2:35:49] little something like that but not
[2:35:50] Hannah she stepped right through the
[2:35:52] whole crowd went to the altar she'd been
[2:35:55] fasting she wanted her reproach taken
[2:35:57] away it was a shame it was hanging on
[2:35:59] her that she couldn't have any children
[2:36:01] what a difference it is today it's
[2:36:03] almost a reproach to have a
[2:36:06] child you know you hear women sometime
[2:36:09] in this Society hopefully not in a holy
[2:36:11] ghost filed church but you hear women
[2:36:13] say I don't really I mean I really don't
[2:36:15] want to because I don't want to ruin my
[2:36:16] figure
[2:36:20] H what a difference it is today almost a
[2:36:23] reproach to have a child then it was a
[2:36:25] reproach not to have one and notice it
[2:36:27] says then and she got on her knees and
[2:36:30] she never noticed the Dignity of the
[2:36:32] temple woo she never noticed the
[2:36:35] dignified priest as he walked out she
[2:36:37] was in such distress till her tears was
[2:36:40] rolling down her cheeks and she was
[2:36:43] crying in desperation oh Lord God give
[2:36:45] me a son give me a son and notice she
[2:36:49] wasn't
[2:36:50] selfish when God heard her and answered
[2:36:53] her prayer and gave her a son what did
[2:36:55] she do she gave him back to God and
[2:36:59] because that she was willing not to be
[2:37:01] selfish after God had answered her
[2:37:03] prayer he wasn't just any
[2:37:06] son he gave her a prophet and I want you
[2:37:10] to know there are still five full
[2:37:12] prophets who are born into the world
[2:37:15] today and there will be until we've all
[2:37:17] come to the unity of the faith there are
[2:37:20] Apostles Born Into the world today and
[2:37:23] there will be until we're all I cannot
[2:37:26] accept a three-fingered God that would
[2:37:28] make God a
[2:37:30] freak or a four-fingered god he has five
[2:37:35] fingers Apostles prophets pastors
[2:37:38] teachers and evangelists and he's
[2:37:41] they're being born into the Earth sir
[2:37:43] they've been born and they're being born
[2:37:45] into the Earth and so you don't ever
[2:37:46] know mother that that little baby that
[2:37:48] you carry right now may have a role to
[2:37:51] play if if Jesus terries and he will if
[2:37:56] he's given them a role to
[2:37:58] play when she heard God and he answered
[2:38:01] her she gave him back to God she was
[2:38:03] willing not to be selfish he gave her a
[2:38:08] prophet oh what an extra blessing oh
[2:38:11] he's just full of them those little
[2:38:13] extra things that he gives not only a
[2:38:15] son but a prophet and there had been no
[2:38:18] open vision for many many years in
[2:38:21] Israel Samuel the first prophet for many
[2:38:25] years be because a mother got desperate
[2:38:28] that she could have no children she was
[2:38:31] past the age of Baron probably 60 70
[2:38:33] years old and she prayed with
[2:38:35] desperation she must have this child
[2:38:38] what was it God had spoke to her no
[2:38:41] doubt you can't be desperate till God
[2:38:44] speaks to you oh Church rise and Shake
[2:38:47] Yourself pitch your conscience wake
[2:38:50] yourself up in this hour we must be
[2:38:53] desperate or perish some around us are
[2:38:56] climbing mountains don't you be on a
[2:38:58] slippery
[2:39:00] slide with the one sitting next to you
[2:39:02] on the Pew climbing mountains you make
[2:39:05] up your mind I'm climbing mountains too
[2:39:08] if he can I can if she can I can I'm not
[2:39:11] going backwards I'm going upwards he
[2:39:14] said there's coming uh there is coming
[2:39:17] forth something from the Lord I know it
[2:39:18] is the say of the Lord there's coming
[2:39:21] forth something and we better get
[2:39:23] desperate it's between life and death
[2:39:25] it'll pass through
[2:39:28] us and we won't see
[2:39:31] it that's what brother brandom said
[2:39:33] about the brown bear
[2:39:35] Vision it passed through
[2:39:37] him and he missed it now that makes him
[2:39:41] an expert in telling us how important it
[2:39:45] is not to let something pass through US
[2:39:48] sir because that she wasn't
[2:39:51] selfish paragraph 101 she was given a
[2:39:54] prophet brother brandom says in the
[2:39:56] message expectation paragraph 44 here
[2:39:59] not long ago listen carefully I was
[2:40:01] coming from Dallas Texas in Spring and I
[2:40:04] I thought I was flying back and I was
[2:40:06] grounded at Memphis right where had to
[2:40:10] be one night on the 5th at Memphis
[2:40:14] Tennessee I was grounded there and they
[2:40:16] put me up there in that I believe the
[2:40:19] Peabody Hotel it's called how many has
[2:40:22] anybody in here ever been to the Peabody
[2:40:24] Hotel it's the hotel where all the Ducks
[2:40:27] March out every day they March the Ducks
[2:40:30] from the roof where they're kept to the
[2:40:33] pond if you go in in in any Peabody
[2:40:36] Hotel there are ducks swimming in the in
[2:40:38] the fountain and at the end of the day
[2:40:41] people gather you'd think it was like
[2:40:43] The Changing of the Guard people gather
[2:40:46] out of their rooms to come down to the
[2:40:47] Fountain to watch a a a a duck keeper to
[2:40:50] come out and March those Ducks out of
[2:40:52] the fountain and back up they all March
[2:40:53] up one one right after another and he
[2:40:56] marches them back up to where they spend
[2:40:57] the night brother brandom I just trying
[2:40:59] to imagine brother brandham in a peab
[2:41:01] hotel I wonder if he watched the Ducks I
[2:41:04] wonder if they did it back then he said
[2:41:07] it's a very nice place myself I couldn't
[2:41:09] afford to go in it but the airlines sent
[2:41:11] me there and I remember that morning
[2:41:13] they called me and said now the plane
[2:41:14] will leave at 8:00 Reverend brandom said
[2:41:17] they'll be by to pick you up are you
[2:41:19] listening are you sure you're listening
[2:41:22] now in the same message uh uh uh no in
[2:41:26] the same title expectation now he's in
[2:41:28] Bingington New York paragraph 63 he says
[2:41:32] I was crossing coming from Dallas Texas
[2:41:34] from a convention each time he told it
[2:41:36] you got a little more detail he said
[2:41:38] just recently about three years ago I
[2:41:40] was crossing over and a storm struck us
[2:41:42] in a plane and we were grounded and they
[2:41:46] put us in a big hotel there I couldn't
[2:41:48] afford to stay in a hotel like that but
[2:41:50] the air service put Peabody Hotel in
[2:41:53] Memphis Tennessee and that night we was
[2:41:56] up there now they called up the next
[2:41:57] morning said the plane will be ready to
[2:41:59] leave at 7:00 so he's got the time
[2:42:01] different here what does that matter
[2:42:04] does that offend anybody you think he
[2:42:06] wasn't a prophet because one time he
[2:42:08] said 8:00 and another time he said 7:00
[2:42:10] you think that changed the ministry that
[2:42:12] God gave him
[2:42:13] hello not at all it reminds me that he
[2:42:17] was a human being
[2:42:20] and he didn't have the gift of perfect
[2:42:21] recall he said I'd wrote some
[2:42:24] letters I'd anointed some handkerchiefs
[2:42:26] and so forth and was going to go put it
[2:42:29] in the
[2:42:30] mail so I got up got the mail and
[2:42:33] started down the street I was going down
[2:42:36] to put it in the mailbox I was going out
[2:42:39] down there walking along please listen
[2:42:42] and the Holy Spirit
[2:42:45] said
[2:42:47] stop well I thought I just and let let
[2:42:50] me tell you something it's not only
[2:42:52] prophets that the Holy Ghost talks to
[2:42:56] he'll tell you to stop if you'll
[2:42:58] listen he'll tell you where to turn
[2:43:01] don't you ever think that it's only an
[2:43:03] elitist group of people that God will
[2:43:05] direct that way he'll direct you that
[2:43:06] way if he can trust you if he can trust
[2:43:09] you he'll direct you this way he said I
[2:43:12] just imagine I heard that he said just
[2:43:14] going to try to Shake it Off went a
[2:43:15] little further farther he says and
[2:43:18] something began to go
[2:43:20] I stopped and I said I need a little
[2:43:21] water somebody if you'll help me
[2:43:25] Father what is it that you would have me
[2:43:27] do I stepped back up to a place like

[3:00:06] storm that would keep brother bandham
[3:00:08] there
[3:00:09] overnight and then he supernaturally led
[3:00:12] him turn here stop here go this way
[3:00:15] cross the street here yeah he spoke to

[3:00:48] joy God loved that woman so much he
[3:00:53] honored the faith of that Praying Mother
[3:00:57] so much that he put all of those
[3:01:00] circumstances in place to give her her
[3:01:03] son back not only healed and whole but
[3:01:07] saved and filled with the Holy Ghost if
[3:01:11] God can do that for mamy's boy dying
[3:01:14] with a veneral disease don't you know
[3:01:16] God can move move for your children
[3:01:19] sister Beverly don't you know God can
[3:01:22] move for your children don't you know he
[3:01:25] knows how and listen folks he doesn't
[3:01:26] have to have an Elijah to do it if
[3:01:29] there's nobody he can send or wants to
[3:01:31] send he knows how to send something into
[3:01:34] the
[3:01:35] room and there because so many watching
[3:01:39] this because you raised your children
[3:01:42] right they
[3:01:43] know that there's a supernatural
[3:01:46] God it wouldn't take much to get a hold
[3:01:50] of their heart when we look at it we
[3:01:53] think it's hopeless but I'm telling you
[3:01:55] a real mother's faith can move a lot of
[3:01:59] things including this weather let's
[3:02:02] stand I'm so
[3:02:05] thankful for many many years I did all
[3:02:07] the
[3:02:08] praying my mama didn't pray for
[3:02:11] me she didn't serve the Lord I prayed
[3:02:15] for
[3:02:16] her I held on to God for
[3:02:19] her I'd ask her mama wouldn't you going
[3:02:22] to quit smoking and surrender your heart
[3:02:24] and serve the Lord she'd say I love to
[3:02:27] smoke I said mother is killing you she'd
[3:02:29] said well you got to die with
[3:02:31] something she had no
[3:02:33] desire there was
[3:02:36] nothing she was always dressed so nice
[3:02:38] she worked at the bank she was always
[3:02:40] dressed so nice she didn't even know how
[3:02:42] bad she
[3:02:43] smelled the smoke just
[3:02:46] permeated the room and then perfume on
[3:02:49] top of that would nearly knock you down
[3:02:52] and I kept
[3:02:53] praying she would come to a service and
[3:02:56] and I would preach my heart out and she
[3:02:58] would go no no pull it looked like it
[3:03:01] looked like there was no
[3:03:03] conviction she kept it from me that God
[3:03:06] was even dealing with her heart and then
[3:03:08] that day he didn't send an Elijah he
[3:03:11] just came he sent his presence into the
[3:03:13] automobile she's driving across the
[3:03:16] Dillingham Street Bridge right right
[3:03:18] down there close to chili Tha in
[3:03:20] Columbus and the spirit of the Lord came
[3:03:22] into the car save my
[3:03:26] mama she said Lord if you'll save me
[3:03:29] I'll Never Smoke again and she did
[3:03:31] terrible thing she threw that cigarette
[3:03:33] over the bridge and into the river but
[3:03:35] it was a wonderful thing I don't know
[3:03:37] how as addicted as she
[3:03:40] was I don't know how she found the grace
[3:03:43] to let it
[3:03:44] go and not only that the drinking
[3:03:48] started a social drink and it got to
[3:03:51] where it was ever night had to be ever
[3:03:53] night she had so much
[3:03:56] uh she was carrying in her
[3:03:59] life and when the Lord saved her she had
[3:04:03] found a man that cared about her and he
[3:04:06] was good to
[3:04:07] her and uh unusual
[3:04:11] circumstances and when God saved her she
[3:04:13] said I don't know how I'm going to find
[3:04:15] the grace but she said I know I can
[3:04:17] can't marry that man I could never be
[3:04:19] with
[3:04:20] him I I can't I know I know what my life
[3:04:23] has to be I have to serve the
[3:04:26] Lord she didn't do it perfectly but she
[3:04:29] did it with all of her heart and from
[3:04:31] that moment on then she prayed for me
[3:04:34] and when I was at my weakest Point
[3:04:36] lowest point my mama prayed for me and
[3:04:40] fasted for me like many of you did until
[3:04:44] her hair would fall out by the
[3:04:46] handfuls she returned ear the favor and
[3:04:49] God heard her prayer and I'm telling you
[3:04:51] what that that reminds me and helps me
[3:04:53] to know that you sisters have more
[3:04:57] power you'll never maybe never sit at a
[3:05:02] at a committee table and move businesses
[3:05:07] around you you may never be a CEO of
[3:05:10] anything but your
[3:05:13] address but you've got power in your
[3:05:16] faith that can move a mighty
[3:05:19] God I want to honor every one of
[3:05:22] you I know I know too
[3:05:25] much I know the
[3:05:30] sacrifices I know the women in this
[3:05:33] house The
[3:05:35] Mamas who prayed for wavered
[3:05:40] husbands and God heard their prayer not
[3:05:43] even their mama their wife and God heard
[3:05:46] their prayer
[3:05:48] I know mothers in this room that have
[3:05:50] prayed for their children and God has
[3:05:53] heard their prayer again and again and
[3:05:55] again so I want to tell you something
[3:05:57] mothers I know you know this I don't
[3:06:00] have to tell you but you're not going to
[3:06:02] be

[3:06:05] mistakes and we already have and we will
[3:06:08] again we do the best we can with what we
[3:06:13] have but I want you to know there's a
[3:06:15] God bigger than your mistakes bigger
[3:06:17] than any slackness on your part bigger
[3:06:20] than any little thing you wished you'd
[3:06:22] have done right my wife was reading an
[3:06:25] article this week and she told me she
[3:06:26] said I wish i' I wish this would have
[3:06:28] dawned on me I wish I would have had a
[3:06:30] hold of this
[3:06:32] earlier I I wish I I would have realized
[3:06:35] the importance of some of this earlier
[3:06:37] well we can't go back and change that
[3:06:40] but we know a God who can we know a God
[3:06:44] who can instill those things in them
[3:06:46] that they need
[3:06:48] for the
[3:06:49] future to those who are not mothers you
[3:06:53] don't have to be a mama to
[3:06:55] pray I owe more than I could ever tell
[3:06:59] you to spiritual women to women who
[3:07:03] prayed for me like a
[3:07:05] mother and God sees
[3:07:08] that and he fills their life with that
[3:07:12] responsibility I'm so thankful for you
[3:07:16] so very thankful
[3:07:19] I know that it's not only me you've
[3:07:21] prayed for you've prayed for all of us
[3:07:25] many of you that are here have prayed
[3:07:27] for all of us Sister train who is not
[3:07:30] here prayed for so many of
[3:07:33] us stayed here longer than she should
[3:07:36] have because she was
[3:07:39] praying when she didn't know where she
[3:07:41] was she was still
[3:07:42] praying God left her here to intercede
[3:07:45] that's the prayer of of a and the faith
[3:07:49] of a Godly woman we are so
[3:07:52] blessed those of you who are about to be
[3:07:55] mothers you see this responsibility that
[3:07:58] lies before you it'll overwhelm you at
[3:08:01] times but you've got to lean on the Lord
[3:08:04] you have to lean on him you will get it
[3:08:08] wrong you will there'll be a time you do
[3:08:11] but his grace and his Mercy if you'll
[3:08:13] let him if you'll depend on him if
[3:08:15] you'll fall on him he'll give you all
[3:08:17] the mercy you need to get up and do it
[3:08:18] again cuz like I said you you can't
[3:08:21] throw it out in the trash like a dead
[3:08:24] plant they're with you they're they're
[3:08:27] you're you're responsible I wish
[3:08:29] everybody who laid down
[3:08:32] together knew how important it is to
[3:08:36] know that you've got what it
[3:08:37] takes to see it through to the
[3:08:40] end because you don't get to drop out of
[3:08:43] this thing it's a lifelong commitment
[3:08:46] well if I could just get him out of my
[3:08:47] house I want you to know if you think
[3:08:49] the burden
[3:08:50] lifts if you think that lifts a burden
[3:08:53] you'll carry a burden for them the
[3:08:54] longest day of your life woo and when
[3:08:57] you get out of here if you get out of
[3:08:59] here before they do you'll still be
[3:09:01] praying for them on the other side I
[3:09:03] believe with all my heart I don't
[3:09:05] believe in the intercession of the
[3:09:07] Saints in the sense that we pray to them
[3:09:09] and get them to go to the father for us
[3:09:10] but I believe I believe I got mama and
[3:09:13] two Granny's on the other side who are
[3:09:15] still praying for me to make it all way
[3:09:17] I'm going all the way I want every
[3:09:20] mother in this place and I would invite
[3:09:22] you if you've been a spiritual mother I
[3:09:24] would invite you to come as well I don't
[3:09:27] mean to differentiate between the two I
[3:09:31] don't know what we would have done
[3:09:32] without some of you praying for our own
[3:09:34] kids sister elreda has done that Sister
[3:09:38] Williams of course she had children of
[3:09:39] her own but has prayed for me and and I
[3:09:42] I I would love to she she's not here
[3:09:44] today but I'd love to say thank you to
[3:10:00] Judith she's prayed for our kids and
[3:10:04] still
[3:10:05] does and God has spoke to her in so many
[3:10:10] times and she has sent a word and it was
[3:10:14] nothing but God and nothing but the
[3:10:16] truth and it brought their mother and I
[3:10:19] so much comfort to know that God was
[3:10:21] talking to somebody else if you've ever
[3:10:24] experienced that to know that God's
[3:10:26] talking to somebody else about your kids
[3:10:28] I'll tell you you'll appreciate it
[3:10:30] you'll be so thankful for it you be that

[3:15:27] families Lord strengthen their faith may

[3:16:02] the spirit of
[3:16:03] conviction upon the the young people and
[3:16:08] the children that are not always

[3:16:11] anymore the young adults and adults that
[3:16:14] are represented today by father mother
[3:16:17] here I pray Lord that you'd bring the
[3:16:20] spirit of conviction into their
[3:16:22] life that they would wake up to the
[3:16:24] reality that Mama's faith is
[3:16:27] real and that her cry is
[3:16:30] faithful and may they find the

[3:17:21] and she was speaking to Bethany who had
[3:17:24] not yet had a family of her own that day
[3:17:27] is
[3:17:29] coming but she was commending her for
[3:17:31] being such an
[3:17:33] auntie and Lord that's that's true for
[3:17:37] so many in this room bless these
[3:17:40] sisters who have labored in the
[3:17:43] spirit on behalf of children that they
[3:17:45] did not bear with their own
[3:17:47] body it's understandable when a
[3:17:50] biological mother has a burden for her
[3:17:52] kids but it's only
[3:17:55] Supernatural when someone who didn't
[3:17:57] birth them can carry such a heavy load
[3:18:00] for
[3:18:01] them to God be the
[3:18:04] glory let them be rewarded for
[3:18:07] everything that is accomplished in your

[3:27:30] in we're going to pray a dismissal
[3:27:33] prayer uh the request that I couldn't
[3:27:36] bring up in my mind was Sister Flo had
[3:27:38] texted last night to say that Garvis was
[3:27:41] very sick and she wasn't going to come
[3:27:43] this morning that he needed to be
[3:27:46] Remembered in prayer and we want to do
[3:27:48] that I have prayed last night but we
[3:27:51] want to do that as we leave and sister
[3:27:53] Sharon had sent a text and she would
[3:27:55] very much like to have been here today
[3:27:58] her mother is is low and weak is not
[3:28:01] eating a whole lot and is sleeping most
[3:28:03] of the time and so sister Sharon needs
[3:28:06] our prayers we need to pray that God
[3:28:08] will strengthen her she's been very
[3:28:10] faithful to pray for us and we want to
[3:28:12] believe the Lord to strengthen her it's
[3:28:14] it's a hard time and the the thought of
[3:28:17] you're spending your last Mother's Day
[3:28:19] some of us have been there you're
[3:28:20] spending your last Mother's Day perhaps
[3:28:23] with your mother it's a little
[3:28:24] overwhelming it can can certainly be and
[3:28:27] even harder for those who don't know it
[3:28:29] and it and yet it happens but we want to
[3:28:31] lift them up to the Lord in prayer that
[3:28:34] God will be with them and and we want to
[3:28:36] pray for safety for those who are
[3:28:38] traveling in any time that brother
[3:28:40] Daniel and sister Anna come to your mind
[3:28:42] please pray for them can you imagine
[3:28:44] being on the dangerous highways with a
[3:28:47] big old truck and trailer and pulling
[3:28:50] sometimes two and three travel trailers
[3:28:53] on a trailer I I don't I don't know how
[3:28:57] uh they can do it but it's only by the
[3:28:59] grace of God and there's not been just a
[3:29:01] couple of close calls there have been
[3:29:03] many close calls so if if they should
[3:29:06] come to your mind I hope they will pray
[3:29:09] for them that God will continue to grant
[3:29:11] them safety and the Lord willing they
[3:29:13] plan to be with us here over the
[3:29:15] Memorial Day we weekend we're looking
[3:29:17] for God to do some great things let's
[3:29:20] pray let's have a little dismissal
[3:29:22] prayer thank you for your patience today
[3:29:24] I hope that your fellowship is amazing
[3:29:27] this afternoon and for those of you who
[3:29:29] didn't get to be with your mother today
[3:29:31] I think of you and I'm going to pray the
[3:29:33] Lord will certainly strengthen you and
[3:29:35] cheer you don't forget there's there is
[3:29:37] a there's a telephone and you certainly
[3:29:39] can can call but I I wish that you had
