[0:06] the most valuable thing in all the earth
[0:09] today is the little bride of jesus
[0:11] christ wherever she is
[0:14] everything that is in god he has poured
[0:16] into her you tell me if she's valuable
[0:19] she may not be perfect in herself but
[0:22] she's not meeting the bridegroom in her
[0:24] own clothes
[0:26] she's meeting him dressed in robes of
[0:29] his righteousness and covered with the
[0:31] cloaks of salvation hallelujah
[0:35] she's not getting her water out of a
[0:37] broken cistern either she's down there
[0:39] drawing up water hallelujah they're
[0:42] far with joy
[0:45] shall ye draw waters from the well
[0:51] the wells of salvation
[0:53] she's getting her joy from her source
[0:58] he is yeshua which means salvation
[1:02] the wells of yeshua the wells of
[1:05] salvation that's where our joy comes
[1:07] from
[1:08] but it doesn't always fall on us
[1:09] automatically
[1:11] therefore with joy shall they draw water
[1:14] from with joy
[1:16] with joy
[1:17] when you make joy your demonstration the
[1:21] lord will show up but when he shows up
[1:24] at the appearing of your joy
[1:26] he will turn this thing around and your
[1:29] enemy shall be put to shame now i want
[1:32] you to know if there's no other reason
[1:35] to wear joy
[1:37] if there's no other reason to display
[1:40] joy that could possibly be a pretty good
[1:42] reason
[1:43] because when the lord shows up and he's
[1:46] not showing up because your enemy is
[1:48] sending him
[1:51] he's showing up because you are choosing
[1:53] to keep your heart right
[1:56] and you're choosing to keep your
[1:58] focus turned in his direction
[2:01] and when your joy begins to come forth
[2:04] anyhow
[2:05] any who
[2:07] when your joy begins to move forth he
[2:10] will come
[2:11] he will come to your joy
[2:13] he will appear to your joy and when he
[2:16] does
[2:17] those enemies who plotted against you
[2:20] they shall be put to shame now you tell
[2:23] me if joy ought to be tucked in your
[2:25] pocket
[2:26] no you ought to wear it around your neck
