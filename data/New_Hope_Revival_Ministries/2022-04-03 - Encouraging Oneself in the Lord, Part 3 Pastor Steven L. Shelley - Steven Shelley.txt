just a moment we don't want that anointing to lift right now we want jesus to have his way [Music] if you came expecting a program we have no program for you we have no plan we've just come today to yield ourselves to the lord and i know that many of you realized that after the service last night and all through the night and perhaps this morning many could feel that swirling and warfare i know i know they don't like to talk about that but i want you to know when jesus starts doing something demons get stirred up strongholds they try to advance and be stronger but you know there's a way to break through the darkness it's by the name of jesus there's a way to get the victory and it's by the name of jesus how many of you believe that why don't you just shout amen right now just a few minutes before we came out here i i sent megan a text and i said be ready just be ready to sing this i know this is not everybody's cup of tea and when i come to your house i'll drink your brand i won't bring my own tea bags i'll drink whatever you give me come on but i get to pick the tea today so i'd like for you to look over anything that's not your style or what you're used to but we have learned that praise is not just lifting the lord it's more than that it's scattering darkness this pushing strongholds out of the way and lies lies get scattered when god's people prays we understand that sometimes we are moving into a place of blessing and praise and sometimes we're warring we don't fight flesh and blood but powers and principalities and spiritual wickedness in high places and i want to megan to come and sing this song to again it may not be your it may not be uh what do they call orange pico or darjeeling or sleepy tea or whatever they have but this is my cup of tea because i've watched god break through chains and fetters and yokes when god's people recognize that we are not shadowboxing fighting an invisible enemy but we're fighting an enemy that likes to break through and manifest himself in this realm so we have to be strategic in prayer and we have to be strategic in praise and how we move and i want you to know you can step over the anointing and cause spiritual whiplash your neck kind of gets sore because you're moving and then you come to a solid stop and it's hard some time to learn the flow of the spirit of god and how his anointing works but we must discover god's heart for our time together this morning and i want you to just worship the lord with me i i gotta i gotta do this and i don't wanna give you whiplash but i gotta do this this morning the lord dealt with my heart several things were really really stirring in my spirit are you all right to stand you folks all right we're going to finish up with this song before we move on god reminded me of a vision i don't often get up here and talk about my visions but i am today for just a moment because he reminded me of something he showed me years ago and i've seen this play out time and time again and if this chokes you i apologize in advance but i feel like i need to read this into the atmosphere because as i said i've watched this play out over and over and over again i saw a long row of cabbage growing in a vegetable garden and each plant had large beautiful leaves with varied shades of green and i walked closer looking down over several plants and i noticed that there were leaves hanging free and loose i saw tiny little heads that were forming in the center of each cabbage plant and i looked over this garden scene and i heard a voice say it's coming to a head do you hear me i heard a voice say it's coming to a head the scene quickly changed and i saw a festering blister on someone's skin i could see that it looked rather flat against the skin but i noticed tiny red streaks indicative of infection moving from the sore across the unbroken skin as i looked on impurity began to form under the blister and i watched it as it came to a head again i heard a voice say it's coming to a head i then saw a red-hot edge of a knife blade as it moved in and tenderly nicked the blister causing all of the poison and the corruption to run free and then i looked on and i saw the hot edge of the knife gently laid against the sore cauterizing it sealing it up to prevent re-infection i believe that part of this warring in the spirit is because once again god through these meetings friday night and last night i believe god was allowing things to come to the head because he by the spirit of god wants to deal with those things in every one of us now he is a perfect gentleman and he is not going to move against your will you know he could how many of you know he knows how to break our will he can do that but he doesn't want to do that he wants you to want him is that okay he wants you to want him and he wants you to need him he's our bridegroom he's our husband and he longs to be desired and wanted and invited to come in and deal with whatever it is that's festering in our lives just beneath the surface of the skin so as we sing this song i don't know what your sores are i don't know what god wants to bring to a head in your life but i know this he wants to so deliver and so heal you and so release all the toxin and the poison out of our life and then come with a hot sword and seal it up am i saying that right caught our eyes i used to be uh afflicted with mouth ulcers as a child and they would get so bad that my cheeks were already puffy but they would swell up like a chipmunk and they would get so infected that i would have to go to the dentist and have them cauterized burned so that they would seal up so the bacteria would stay out if you and i in this moment of time would offer god anything and everything in our lives that lays beneath the surface that the enemy tries to stir us or pull us or move us out of god's divine will for our lives if you will offer that up to him today i believe he'll come with a hot edge of a spiritual sword i believe that he will prick that sore and let that poison and toxicity drain out of whatever that circumstance or situation is and if you'll tarry long enough i believe he'll come and lay that same sword the same sword that cuts open it's the same sword that heals i believe he wants to heal us today i believe he wants to help our sore necks i believe he wants us to move with him today how many of you are interested in moving with the lamb [Music] for the battle is raging the devil is raging and i don't want to be sleeping while the battle is raging but my spirit is willing though my flesh gets tempted rise of my soul [Music] for the battle is raging the devil is raging and i don't want to be sleeping while the battle is raging but my spirit is willing though my flesh gets tempted rise of my soul start [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] put on a hole [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] armory [Music] [Music] [Music] give me eyes [Music] is [Music] [Music] we offer it up to you right now [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] open doors [Music] blessed be [Music] for warsaw [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] me [Music] blessed be the name of the lord my rock the train my hands will battle train my [Music] [Music] change my hands [Music] [Applause] now lord jesus we thank you right now we thank you right now for the promise lord i can't speak for anybody else but i have offered you those things that i want you to deal with [Music] the deliverances that i need in my life i've offered those things to you lord and i'm trusting your word i'm trusting your promise that there's nothing too difficult for you there is nothing too hard for you now lord we move forward in this service because we believe you've got something for us we believe you're going to use brother daniel lord to minister to us and to help us i thank you for clearing the atmosphere i thank you for pushing away all the darkness we will not entertain that anymore in this service we want to entertain the king of kings and the lord of lords blessed be the name of the lord you can return to your seats hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can you take it now or do i need to sing something for you to take it you better get a better mic than this one though this is muffled i'm sorry how we worship you lord hallelujah i love you lord jesus i love you lord hallelujah

daniel miller we love you we're so thankful that god has sent you our way we love sister anna we love the whole family and it's going to be very hard to see some of them leaving us now but we know

never say goodbye again anybody looking forward to that we just fellowship in his presence for all eternity i'm looking forward to it raise your hand toward the servant of the lord father hide our brother behind the cross of calvary may he be a beautiful reflection of your love and your power and your grace lord let your word burn in his mouth as he releases a deliverance lord that word comes

big old ears if i have to joshua or ben if i have to just get me a cordless and we'll give this thing to somebody it fits i want to say thank you to the band this morning you all have done admirably this weekend yes very anointed i'm going to ask a favor of you so benjamin we've we've tried to utilize some of our friends and our family but as we come to a close here in a few minutes if you guys would rush back i'm gonna do a song with just my guitar this morning here in a minute but i want you guys to go get a drink of water find a comfortable seat we're going to do a little recap so we'll dismiss you and we'll read the scripture but you may be seated this morning before we read the scripture i just have it on my heart to encourage you in a couple things you've heard me refer to brother branham quite frequently throughout the weekend and we'll be doing just a little bit more of that this morning because god dealt with my family supernaturally i often when i've traveled overseas i've shared the testimony of my father we honor my mom and dad for being with us today and it's such a privilege for me to get to minister the gospel in front of my father who i grew up hearing preached such beautiful sermons that he got from the message of the hour i really well remember him talking about god didn't he didn't make a law that said the next person that looks at that light on the end they're going to die god didn't make a law and then and he used me as a type and he said if i was god he didn't send his son i didn't send daniel to die in your stead dad was teaching me the singularity of god and how that god himself created a flesh body and poured himself into it i remember that sermon on that muddy river road in that little old church it's still there i remember years later dad getting inspiration and he had three jars and he wrote on the jars brother shelly he wrote faith temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and love and he wrote the words out on the jar and he would set him on the pulpit and he would bring a jug and the jug was a type of the holy spirit and he had two other jars he had a jar that was full uh or on the outside it was all dirty and unclean and it was my life and he would teach how that jar got all messed up in the world and how that if we just come into the presence of god the washing of the water i think my son-in-law mentioned it to me there's waters of separation in our life and it begins to wash away the things and it'll empty out the dirt from inside our life and dad had a jar that he had uh filled early in the day and it had spirit in it but it had a little dirt in the bottom and as the day went on that dirt would settle so flat there'd just be a little bit of brown and dad would preach in power and demonstration about how our life we come into the presence of the lord and god cleans us up and he wants to set us aside for service and he said but too many times we don't allow the holy ghost to take us all the way to the top we might get a little faith and we might get a little virtue and we don't get it all and he had picked that jar up he said in the end result is seven times worse and he'd shake that jar that that mud had settled in and that jar would turn black and it would show the condition that our life goes back to when we don't get full of the holy ghost my daddy wouldn't have had the inspiration to preach those things if he hadn't learned that god sent a prophet yes amen it was 1976 it was the summer before i was born and it wasn't just any prophet god didn't come and vindicate me last night oh we've got testimonies from around the world of a vindicated prophet i my father-in-law is a living witness of a vindicated prophet i've stood on this stage that's featured in this book by julius ted's clef and it shows the tens of thousands of people i have talked to some of them on the streets of durban that were there my wife has sang right here facing that uh that which brother branham drew a lot bigger crowd than we did his gift was a lot bigger than mine tens of thousands of miracles this book is just on the healings that happened in africa there's another book in brother shelley's office that talks about how the mayor of the city gave him a key i believe it was and they marched out singing only believe singing brother branham's theme song his theme was hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he does not change if the lord will help us today and i know some of you have to go i know some of you have to slip out but if the lord will help us today the challenge of these meetings has been to draw us into the holiest of holiness the challenge of this meeting is to get us to return to that sanctuary brother shall he come and he did he did oh brother shelley did battle this morning and i'm so thankful for a man of god that will battle in the spirit i'm so proud to be somewhere where we're not fighting men and women but we're fighting spirits and we're dealing with spirits and we got enough wisdom to know when a spirit gets on our wife or a spirit gets on our child oh god we need you to do something about that that's right that's right oh it's not an angry man it's an angry god we want to keep him happy this is a distant relative of the florence nightingale the reason brother branham went she'd got down to about 50 pounds she'd written a letter and she sent an airplane ticket with the letter back in the 50s you could buy a hard paper ticket that was good to use when you went to the airport we things change in our our society our culture things have changed so much this little old lady had got down to 50 pounds brother branham went and laid hands on her and prayed for and i used a bunch of brother shelley's cards to mark them because i got to be able to tell people where i'm going to church this was the letter that came when god fully healed her yes you say oh brother daniel there's many ministries with miracles oh no you don't understand god told my dad in 1976 my mom was expecting me and god told my dad he's a baptist man dad come to my mom one day and he said i believe god's coming back janet i believe the lord's going to return i think the preachers are right the coming of the lord is at hand but i begin to see in god's word that he sent a forerunner before he came the first time and dad didn't have any theological training he didn't have any seminary training but again he got stirred inside and he said i think he's going to send a forerunner just like john the baptist and little did my daddy know that there was word for that from malachi to jesus himself to the book of revelation that talked of an angel that was to come little did he know that when the disciples asked jesus why do the scribes say that elias must come that the christ prophesied of william branham you say brother daniel are you allowed to say that if i'm not allowed to say it no one is allowed to say it jesus said elijah truly shall first come and restore all things it's not the ministry of daniel miller it's not the ministry of eddie miller it's not the ministry of forest farmer forest farmer a five-year-old crippled boy daddy told him you ask him you take him out there if you haven't heard this testimony you ask him at lunch today he's got several to tell he's got a brother some of my sisters come up for prayer last night wanting god to do something for them and their reproductive organs and oh how it stirred me about spiritual food in due season and oh how it stirred me how it stirred me about my granddaughter's namesake gwendolyn who stood in that prayer line in spiritual food in due season and who the prophet of god began to discern the woman in front of her and said i see that you got a problem in your female organs and he said now by the apostolic gift that's within me i lay hands on you at the command of the word and when brother forrest's mother stepped up brother branham didn't even have to lay hands on her he didn't even have to pray for it he said you had female trouble oh yes the god we serve but if we're not careful as brother shelley was talking to us about those things this morning and how god it's the same sword it gets hot you don't know what it is to have to hold the word of god you don't know what it is you don't know what it is you have to look and say devil i see you [Music] you criticize a man of god because he preaches the word of god and may god give us the grace today to turn that blade just like that get it hot and lay that on that open wound may the bleeding stop this morning you think you're hurting this morning you ought to be the preacher some of you slept bethany told me daddy i got the best night's sleep that i've had in months i'm gonna have her testified to you this morning our testimony is our delivery but not all are called to handle the sword not all are called to do battle in the spiritual realm not all are called to handle it and cut those spirits off of people and to cut them up and oh i wish i would have killed them dead brother shelly i wish they hadn't lingered i wish i knew more but i'm young in this spiritual battle i've been preaching a long time without him i've been preaching from an intellectual conception but by god's grace i go forth to hold the word high and i will preach what he called me to preach and i will bring god's deliverance wherever he'll send me and i'll do it by whatever means necessary and if he'll let us this morning we'll lay that hot blade on those open wounds but you think you were cut up last night i went home so bloody i showered and i showered and i showered and i prayed about three o'clock in the morning the presence of the lord come there were rainbows on the ceiling and there were lights on the walls and i bathed in his presence and i knew i knew by his grace i'd done what he called me to do i knew that i'd accomplish the task and as i draw these meetings to a close and i try to do what the heavenly fathers asked me to do i wanted to give honor not just to my father not just to my wife's father but the miracle of this gift brother shelley was preaching a meeting in indiana i think i've only heard this testimony once but now it's mine now it's mine pentecostal preacher preaching revivals laying hands on the sick thank you brother luke preaching revival laying hands on the sick of man walked into the meeting i believe brother shelley told me he had walked into his father's shop just as he fired up a weed eater and it took out both eyes one eye part of one eye their peace were missing out of one and god did in at the hands of a servant of god who believed that jesus christ was the same yesterday oh brother shelly already had a revelation of hebrews 13 8 he knew that the promises of the word of god were for this day for this hour for this people god sent him from that meeting where miracles were being done and said i have something for you in anderson north carolina south carolina it'll be more mine after today he went down there and he began to do battle and he began to war and he began to find the mind of god he knew god had something for him and one day one day a little man walked in he heard him preaching on the radio and he thought oh i've got to get to my brother i've got to get to my brother that's a believer that's the believer i have to get to my brother brother cleveland i believe it was come in with a little brown bag oh church if you ain't got a little brown bag get your brown bag today we're gonna break bread in a few minutes and when we break bread we're gonna feast on the hidden manna we're gonna feast on the fruits of the land we're gonna eat whatever he provides for us to eat today take your brown bag when you leave take it to somebody and share what god has done for you [Applause] it wasn't a church age book that brother shelley was given but like many of us we stick that stuff away well that's for another time or that wasn't what they think it is and we've got interpretation for what we think it is and we put that away and we never even crack the book if we're not careful we never tell anybody about what our family and friends discover i told my wife i said you know when i was in school i had this young lady that seemed to be somewhat attracted to me and sometimes you get worried about things and people think oh you know they're only coming because this or you get around people that you're around in your childhood and it's infatuation or it's this or it's that i told my wife i said you know really in school people weren't attracted to me they were really attracted to the jesus in me and i didn't even know how to manifest him good but i've always had a draw to my personality and my wife assured me that i was right because she said you weren't that attractive in high school [Music] that's just the kind of relationship that we have and i'm so and i'm so glad of that no she when i shaved my head she was like that's it right there that's the look we're going for brother shelly put that bag that that brother gave him he said i believe this will bless you i believe you'll like this or whatever brother shelley then he had one of them union voices somebody come come to him i i bet i bet what's in that bag is tapes of william yes and i just want you to know that he teaches that eve had sex with a rattlesnake that's what he told me brother shelley lie oh goodness he couldn't destroy it but he put it as high up on the shelf and put it out of sight as far as he could get it but that wasn't the end of the story so not only can you ask my daddy may not be able to communicate with you like he used to but my mama knows all the stories so you can ask my mama while we're having lunch here in a few minutes if you stick around and she'll tell you what god's done in our life you can ask brother forrest his stories and he can take you from only believe to spiritual food new season wherever you want to go and if you ain't heard brother shelly's story won't you ask him today we'll go on a missionary trip together and we'll hear about a god that's not just a god of history but he's a god of right now right now you can be stirred inside and as we wrap up friday night and saturday night and we hear the word of god i've got a portion of two different sermons that i'm going to read just to try and lay that blade there and seal the deal but understand the blade's still hot it's the same blade it's still hot it's going to sting brother branham often refers in his ministry and i got nice things to say as we close the service and that's why i i'll be honest with you i don't know as much about worship as i do about getting in the spirit and that's just the truth i know a lot of people can bring you to the threshold but they can't bring you to the throne they can get that anointing around them they can get him to come for those in need but they can't keep you there until you're free i've watched it for a lot of years i've been in services where they put their hand over the mouth of a sister that was fixing to speak in tongues i've been in services where they pushed them to their seat i've been in services where things disrupted the move of the spirit in the natural realm jesus himself when going to raise jairus daughter only took two of the three of the twelve disciples and when he got to the house jesus had to put everybody outside now i ain't jesus i can't tell you why we didn't see more miracles but we saw some i'm praying for sister rebecca i believe it was brother greeley's got her i got her she asked for a completion i don't all of it that still gets me she asked for all of it austin is screaming at me and i can't hear him i'm standing right here and i'm trying to lay hands on her then all of a sudden something hits me so my wife looks over and thought i was getting electrocuted i was almost to pass out and i'm twisting in the anointing and one eye pops open and here's brother shelley doing his thing and i'm like well this is going to be a fine howdy duty if i get slain in the spirit you're sure enough gonna have to clean up this mess so i had to get myself together a little bit just so we could finish what we were doing cause my sister was getting a blessing but so was ah ah will never be the same and i will never go back no only forward there's no back plate in my armor [Music] and it and if this ain't that i'll keep this till that comes right okay them prophets rebuked them i don't want it to sting quite that bad yeah we'll just skip that it might sting too much i know you do but we're we're trying to stop the bleeding oneness now the church now is engaged to christ for the wedding the wedding has never been performed yet it will be at the wedding supper of the lamb can you all hear me okay so we see that the church is now engaged like a man engaged to his wife what does he do while they're engaged he's just bestowing all kinds of things sending her presents making her feel good oh brother shelley i like to worship him i didn't know it was this much fun it makes me feel good now that i know what it's like i'm going to keep doing it he's just bestowing all kinds of things sending her presents making her feel good well that's what christ is doing to his church he's sending us gifts of the spirit how can you be engaged when you're denying these gifts exist it's the very love tokens it's god's token to the church jesus said so these signs in other names i'm going to quote scripture now i'm reading a quote but i'm going to quote scripture joel i will pour out my spirit on only the men of the church i will pour out my spirit on only the fivefold ministry oh i will pour out my spirit on my sons and my daughters okay amen i'll take an anointing how about you sisters now keep those things in mind the church must believe every word every promise every iota and claim it for themselves my eyes are getting bad and exercise themselves in it well how do we exercise ourselves in though every word oh oh you mean you mean benjamin judah coming over here and loosening up his voice it's that little warm up judah we get a little bit ready how many have you ever been to a gym and know what it is to lift a weight how many you know what it is to go to gym class and skip a rope there's so much we do because some teacher in some school tells us to but boy bless god the preacher better not tell us how to praise all right daniel well turn the blade flat daniel turn the blade flat exercise themselves if i was engaged to a girl and i was a single man and i send her something an engagement ring and she wouldn't wear it then that shows she doesn't believe me now this ain't a pro-engagement ring quote no i just want to point that out because since i've been around just a couple weeks at my home church i've discovered that it's not our culture to give big old gaudy diamonds to girls to signify our love and you know brother force it just does my heart good because i see how that lines up with peter and paul's preaching and especially paul because paul said if i or an angel from heaven preach any other doctrine than what i've delivered unto you don't make me get the sword out because i know what to do with it i know it's weight i know it's balance and i know what it does and i knew what was going on last night the spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophet there was no accidents there were no mistakes to speak against the move of god is to blaspheme the holy spirit give a person grounds for divorce and do all kinds of things in a home if a person speaks against the man of god when he's delivering the word of god it's dangerous business it's not only sin to add to the word of god it is also sin to take from the word of god i don't have to scream at the top of my lungs unless he tells me to scream at the talk of my lungs but when he anoints me i'm going to do what he anoints me to do and if he puts a jump in my step like he does them kilimanjaros or however that is last night as i was up here dancing before the lord god told me i'm in all people daniel i'm in all people god does not recognize race like this poor white boy from arkansas preach a minute god does if he sees anything when he sees the color of our skin he sees the beautiful bouquet of his garden oh my thus dumb humans start comparing ourselves to other things and how much better we are and dumb americans oh i'm supposed to be sealing the deal dumb americans start going over and teaching people how to be americans our sisters in our churches post them big old gaudy engagement rings so that every other sister in the church tells their husband if you loved me you'd go spend four thousand dollars on me ring and as soon as that sister gets a four thousand dollar engagement ring that sister says she got one like that i want one that cost six thousand dollars and the only thing us guys can do is go buy an 80 000 truck and say look at me [Music] you're riding around you're sitting on eight ten thousand dollar diamond rings just like the world don't ask me what i paid for that stupid truck outside they've been calling every day since i got here they probably got a tracking device on it too they'll come get it if i don't pay them now keep these things oh well i got skipped i don't want to skip i'm going to let it sink in a little bit today the babies will sleep if i keep calm because we done stirred a bunch of things up if i was a single man i sent her something engagement ring and she wouldn't wear it that show she doesn't believe me she doesn't want to be my bride and if christ sends his church the gifts that he promised and they refused them and say they're not so they don't want to be the bride of christ they are espoused to some other lover and not to christ the bridegroom so the real church keeps the promise and keeps all and accepts the gifts god sends them all right now the first human beings disfellowshipped themselves from believing themselves from believing god by disbelieving his word and listening to a lie of the devil y'all wanna know what the lie was it's one word can you hear me it was one word god said you shall surely die and that snake in the grass that wasn't a snake in the grass yet it's one of god's freckles for this body of believers that beast was walking around why would god curse something to crawl on the ground that already crawled on the ground because it wasn't crawling on the ground that thing talked and the bible says that it beguiled eve you might take that back to your greek you're amplified that snake in the grass seduced eve and jesus had a little theological discussion with the scribes of his day because he told them you're of your father the devil and they knew serpent seed doctrine and they argued with him we be abraham's seed we're not cain's seed we're not of that he said we're of abraham and jesus said if you knew abraham you'd know me because before abraham was i'll let you in on a little bit of the clothes right now just to soothe you before abraham was you are now that's the first thing that disfellowshipped this wonderful union now look adam and eve in a position to never die in a position to never be old to never be sick to never have a worry you say i sure wish i could be like that let me i got news for you you are in the same position god places that to every creature on earth in the same position what was the agreement if you'll keep my words if my word if you'll keep it believe it and act upon it but the very first time that eve disbelieved took one word away from god said it broke off fellowship with that great union and the minute that the church disbelieves any one word of god's bible and places it somewhere else then they break off that wonderful fellowship that's offered to them and to be separated as soon as she did that death set in her mortal beings not only her mortal but her spiritual being she broke off relationship with god the minute she disbelieved and no man can believe here it is no man no woman can believe the devil's lie until they have disbelieved god's truth true no one can believe the devil's lie until they i just that's powerful this morning that's it one more little searing before we move to the final part of our meetings this weekend this is such a i want the body to know my wife and i are already in mourning at our departure tomorrow there is a melancholy that came over us last time i knew that if i didn't leave without having breakfast with my shelly family i would never leave i fell so in love with brother stephen and sister stacy on saturday my wife came to me and she couldn't tell me everything that god was doing for her she had to reserve because she knew the order of the body was for me to make a decision now i have to put some word out here this morning that is a little bit searing sisters if your husband calls you to the word of god hear me you must come in subjection to the word of god if your husband causes you to leave the word of god you must not you must stay with the word your first commitment yes christ told you to submit but not into worldliness not into carnality not into something contrary to his word how do you know that your conversation will not sanctify the man but if your husband's is fortified behind the word then stay behind yes huh i turned my page without reading my notes and i didn't number them 107. that's what it is it's to make you live brother brandon preached a sermon in 1959 in december i forgot to note where it was but it's what was the holy ghost given for such a simple title and he answers this question throughout the sermon and we've preached two days about getting back to our first love we've preached for two days about what the word will cause us to do and what will happen when we don't do that word brother branham said that's what it is it's to make you live a holy life that's what the holy ghost is powerful to set your affections on things above where god stands the mind of christ in you whose mind yes and who was christ all that god was so that fleshly tabernacle was god and the mind not the heart the mind that was in that body can be in you that's a freckle make you live a holy life that's what the holy ghost is power for the mind of christ you can't help from seeing those things when you look at them you turn your head men oh i added a word brother branham said you turn your head period that's right it's to make you the holy ghost is our strength man you want help around the house you want a more affectionate relationship with your wife quit stopping to ogle women get the holy ghost brother and knock it off jesus said i didn't come to do away with the law i come to magnify the law i come to magnify the law and if we're not careful he said that if man looks on a woman to lust after he's committed adultery and when jesus poured himself in that seventh church age messenger that's her closing scripture because god wants you to be a queen of heaven that's part of our clothes today he he wants you in this throne room with him and then he wants you manifesting to the earth but if we're not careful we don't take every word and apply it we don't take the mind of christ and get it in there and we just i'm sorry but guys you don't have to watch pornography to think the wrong thought i mean i don't know what line you cross but it's a sad day when preachers wives are posting on social media what their favorite tv shows are and they've got nudity and everything else in them but it ain't got to be nudity to be ungodly it's a sad day when we backslid to the point with that we have no conviction you say well you're just condemning me preacher really no i love you i don't want to pinch you as brother brahms fixing to say but this stings a little cause we're trying to cauterize that and show you all you've got to do to see if that spirit comes haunting you is give it the word test it's a word me and my daddy like we've used that a long time in our life that's what pulpits need in them it's what preachers need them and it's got to be both sides i'm fixing to read you the rest of this quote and brother brahm talks about what grace is yes it's going to shock you what grace is i'm sorry to tell you that but you just don't have as much revelation as you think you do you got lots and lots of education lots and lots of understanding lots and lots of head knowledge but when you get a revelation it changes the way you look at ministry it changes the way you look at gifts you say i can't do it oh i just can't do it brother braham says sure you can't but the holy spirit come for the purpose it come to take it out of you all of them old habits and things you're doing i wonder i wonder after this weekend how many of you are going home to get it all cleaned out oh yeah we're going to quit throwing dice and we're going to quit playing cards and whatever oh yeah whatever whatever i'm preaching it myself oh brethren brother daniel through dice you just don't even want to know how backslid we got when was making money 2008 my wife and i made 1.2 million dollars and them stinking riverboats up in uh missouri got a lot of it because i didn't have a watchman watching my back i'm a very transparent preacher i told you last night i told you last night you want to be mad at me don't be mad at me for preaching the word be mad at me for being backslidden on your watch that old backbiting separating yourself saying bless god i'm a methodist i won't have nothing to do with them old holy rollers the holy ghost come to take that out of you i'm a baptist i'm a presbyterian i'm a charismatic i'm a oh whatever it's my old my old age again sorry what he said i wouldn't go to that little old holy roller bunch the holy ghost come to take all that starch out of you where's my daughter bethany bethany won't you give us a twirl baby i know you posted one on social media this morning but i'd sure like to see one i think that dress will work and shoes might not you might have to pray about that a little bit [Applause] you better take them shoes off before this service is over you might break your ankle i got quotes on that too baby but i didn't bring none of them today it wasn't even brother brown's dream it was a woman's dream that brother branham quoted a woman's dream that brother branham quoted about heels too high and you can't walk it and he really preached against spike hills but puts a wiggle in your step sister we don't need to see that on the church grounds i'm a baptist i'm a presbyterian i wouldn't go to that little old holy roller bunch the holy ghost come to take all that starch out of you that's what it did it washes you in the blood irons you out that's what it come to do it come to straighten you up make the crooked places straight that's what it come to do straighten it up make the high places low well we'll take a proud look brother shelley and it'll just put it right down and it'll take that old woe is me spirit and it'll lift it right up it'll take the high places low it'll make all the mountains look like they're dancing like little rams [Music] saying oh brother daniel you're just trying to work me up oh i wish i could work you up wish i had the gift of working it up oh brother graham said the birds sing different joy bells are ringing you ever sang it is joy unspeakable and full of glory full of glory are full of glory it is joy unspeakable and full of glory oh the half has never yet been told oh what you talking about preacher unspeakable joy oh i'm talking about languages that cannot be understood by mortal error unspeakable joy there is no excuses that's what it come to do that's the purpose of god sending the holy ghost so you would do these things that you would walk after him now i don't want to hurt you but i told you i'm here with the deepest of sincerity trying to keep from pinching you once in a while i jump off on the line somewhere staying with the truth but staying there and making it such a way it won't pinch you too hard but i want to tell you something and i'm going to quote a vindicated prophet and i'm going to do my best not to preach this i'm just going to quote william branham who my dad had the good fortune of understanding who he was although he was not there on the banks of the ohio river when brother branham was baptizing his 17th person and the same pillar of fire that would created a burning bush come down and hung in the heavens that day and many heard a thunder but a few heard the voice and they inscribed what that voice said i believe on brother branham's tombstone that voice said as your message or as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ your message will forerun the second coming of christ you say what are you brother daniel i am a message believer i follow the message of the seventh church age messenger tell you something a little cute from my dad's ministry our young people will get this dad was teaching one time on the authority of that angel and what revelation 10 verse 7 says referring to revelation 3 14. dad says but in the days of the voice and that's a big butt because it's calling attention to a time when there would be a voice go out and say all the mysteries there would be a voice go out and say wrap up all the loose sins you say brother daniel are you telling me there's nothing you don't know no i'm telling you there's nothing he didn't know and i'm still learning i am not the vindicated prophet of this day i am just a preacher which is a prophet but not a major major prophet not a big deal prophet brother branham was a big deal prophet and there's all kinds of prophets jesus said they'll say lo he is here and lo he is there but don't do that but he said when a prophet comes and he says something in the name of the lord and he had it i hope i know what it is i hope i've got it all i can do is quote it and if i quote it i can say thus saith the lord when i'm quoting it but i got to be careful with that when i ain't quoting something if god sells something to me let me tell you what brother brown said about supernatural gifts and i know brother shelly knows as well as anybody but this is for my friends if you say something in the name of the lord and it don't come to pass your need to seek out somebody and get that lion devil prayed off of you because that ain't the spirit of christ now we had a beautiful thing i told my wife a few weeks ago one reason why my friends brother randy and sister lisa are sitting here is god did a miracle and i didn't want to talk about it while sister kaylee was here but she had to go home she's got a job and you guys remember her in prayer god's done a great work in her life and i know he wants to continue that but i told my wife we went into a little service things had lined up they said would you all come by the house and there's just this little candle fell in place and this domino fell and presence of the lord come and brother randy and i were ministering together his daughter maggie was sitting there and we were talking about how god before you were in your mother's womb god formed you and randy's molding his daughter's eyes and kaylee's sitting over here and and god is just showing me her and i'm not looking and i'm i'm not wanting to draw on her and i'm not wanting to touch her and i told the family they said we won't take you to dinner tomorrow night i said all right i said god wants to finish that work in kaylee's life that he started and then i told my wife oh kaylee wants to talk to her mom and dad about something heavy it's so heavy it's so hard to bear i don't know what it is but it needs to come out and god did a miracle that night it came out i watched lisa do one of the most beautiful things i've ever seen a mother do for a child in pain brother greeley in honor of you today if i'd had the opportunity i would have brought a tub and a towel and i would have washed your feet from these saints today i honor you today i know no greater way to serve god's man than to do what jesus commanded me to do and wash her feet but i watched sister lisa wash her daughter's feet and to tell her that she was clean by the repentance and the coming forth of the thing we stood there and i stood in our doorway and i said guys i'm out god did what he wanted to do i'm done but god wasn't done but all i know is the little things he shows me i don't know big picture for any of your life i can't tell you what you're supposed to do and where you're supposed to go but i can tell you i'm drinking a water i've never drunk so deep before i'm i'm becoming saturated with him and i know he wants to do more with me if i can get out of his way if i can get out of his way and stay out his way oh he's gonna do the greater works and he wants to do it in you it ain't about me it's about us we are the manifested sons and daughters of god but we must stay in line with that word for the moment we leave one word we leave our husband i want to tell you something if the bible says that it's wrong for a woman to cut her hair and you say you've got the holy ghost then cut your hair i wonder if you have don't get mad if it does that still shows there's another mark against you if the bible says it's wrong for a woman to put on a garment that pertained to a man and you wear these little overalls and slacks out here on the road you grown women guess a little baby would be play with the little boys and things but look when you're grown women 15 16 18 years old up to grandma out here on the road and the bible said it's an abomination in the sight of god for a woman to wear those things and you wear them anyhow and you say you got the holy ghost i wonder sometime the holy ghost will follow god's word to the letter i'm sorry but i'm not i didn't say it i brought you some pictures everybody's got nice stuff to talk about if you want to know what the world thinks symbology for female and male are i will point you back to uh yeah a bathroom sign i've used it you have a perfect example that ain't a super person in a cape they didn't get that from some marvel or dc comic book it's modest apparel in the end time it's the end time signification of what a lady is supposed to be a few years ago when target started changing their rules on who could use what bathroom it became such a blow up and even my family and a few places got to modifying the sign a little bit this one says attention gentlemen it's got two women in dresses this is a women's restroom i found one oh i didn't get it downloaded i found one in a college and it showed the man and it showed the woman and it showed the handicapped chair and it said this is a transgender bathroom i hope they're not implying that anybody in a handicapped chair is a transgender all i could figure all i could figure they were implying that it doesn't matter how you dress to go in that bathroom and man how many charismatics and christians got all up in arms over men wearing dresses and going to the bathroom did we not did we not across the nation it was the news agencies and it was all anybody talked about well brother branham was talking about it before it was cool this is the last paragraph bethany about ready testify to us baby and the preacher behind the pulpit this is just one quote i've just read it in order and a preacher behind the pulpit that ain't got grace enough to preach it i doubt he's got it i've heard some preachers preach for 20 years that ain't never hit holiness not once i worry about you brother branham said if a preacher behind the pulpit ain't got grace enough to preach it i doubt he's got it that's just exactly well that's what the holy ghost is for do we believe do you love the word of god this morning is it important to you it's important to me it's important to see my children raised by matthew mark luke john and mama it's important to me and scrambled my stuff all up my goodness one of these days i'll be a better preacher or i'll just quit one of the two here we go that's all i need right there we got to have a scripture but i want you all to hear from my daughter i want this thing that god did for her to lock in she's had several experiences with the lord i do believe there's baptism on top of baptism i do but i believe when he caps you with the seal i believe it's over too many people too many places i'm not going to plug in buddy we're good i'm just gonna sing this sweetheart did you have those lyrics did you send me is my wife in the room i don't know if i got the voice to sing it do you mind helping me you got a cordless mic brother shelly you might need

hand [Music] and take away my full shame my life is changed i will endure into jesus arms i am secure now i have a brand new start he did a surgery in my heart now there's healing in the blood that he shed so willingly there's no way i can't explain what my savior means to me he took away the hurt and pain and i've got heaven now to gain he did a surgery in my heart when he fixed the broken palms when i come down to the end life's tolls and heartaches will lead [Music] gathered all around they'll pray that grace will sure heaven's beauty i will see love once there to welcome me cause the victory has been won by the blood of god's own sun now there's healing in the blood [Music] means to me took away the hurt and pain and i've got heaven now to gain he did a surgery in my heart when he fixed the broken part [Music] brother benjamin if you and the rest of the team would be getting ready to lead us some in some worship i sure would appreciate i'll read a scripture and one more quote before we're done but bethany is going to share her testimony from last night if you need notes you get them i don't want you forget nothing so last night daddy was preaching about the different addictions that people have and the things that they feel are more important in their relationship with jesus and the things that they put before him and it got me thinking about some of the addictions that i have and the things that i would rather be doing than reading my bible or listening to a tape or even listening to a sermon just the things that i felt were more important and sister is it jaya or jaya sister jaya was singing that song last night and she's saying a lot the line the higher the need the higher i'll reach and i realized that i had a need but i didn't know what it was and i was standing there and i was just praying and i had both my hands raised and daddy was praying for people and i was like well he can't come stand by me he's doing his job and i was like maybe brother stephen would come and just hold my hand and just stand by me and he was there and he just took my hand and he started praying with me he said god you know her heart's desire and you know her thoughts he said i pray that you fulfill her heart's desire tonight and you give her her need and in that moment i realized what my need was and i desired to have him back and i knew that i needed him but i didn't know i didn't know how to get him back and i just stood there and i prayed and i asked and i asked that he would come back to me and i don't know exactly when or where i lost him along the way but brother stephen i know this is standing right there last night i got him back and i found him again and i'm so happy so much peace oh only god only god can do those things i'll give this if you've got your bibles and you'll stand for a scripture reading this afternoon just give us i don't know i've got one quote left it's a beautiful one what's so funny about this is i told my son-in-law i'm not going to tell this but i am i've already read all of this other and one of what i read it just ties right in because there is deliverance there is hope there is peace if you stand here this afternoon and like bethany there's a deep calling then there has to be a deep out there to respond david wrote of those things that the noise of thy water spouts oh god i want to be where the fountain is i want to be where the roar is i want a feast i want to drink i want to i want to thrive revelation chapter 1 i believe it is should have marked my bible hi john verse 9 [Applause] not john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ i went too far john verse 4 i'm sorry skipped john to the seven churches which are in asia by the revealed word for our day we know that he was writing two letters that day he was writing to a literal place on a map and he was right into a disposition of time by the revealed word for our day we know that ephesus was the first church and it was the first church age and there's much you can study and there's much you can learn by the revealed word for our day but john said grace be unto you and peace if i can leave you with grace church yes did you hear what grace is some preachers don't have enough grace they don't have enough love to tell you the truth you better find somebody that loves you so much that they'll tell you the truth jesus christ who is the grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the earth of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth yes unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood oh do you know you're clean today do you know that we preach the word of god and all you have to do is say i repent that's it it only takes a moment's time in his presence when i watch that witness of a mother's love and the bathing of those feet and i was reminded of mary magdalene crawling her way into that preacher's house that didn't love jesus enough to make sure the foot wash guy was at his post you may be seated just a moment before the worshipers come mary magdalene had heard that this man that had perhaps stood at the well that day and had told that lady every sin she had ever committed she had heard that that man was coming to her town i'm assuming it was mary magdalene i don't actually remember just a mary of mary's in the new testament but she heard that jesus she smelled the cooking she knew they were throwing a party at simon's house and she knew jesus was going to be because jesus keeps his appointments and he goes where he's invited he and he stays where he's made welcome he stays where he's made well but she thought you know maybe this is what i've been waiting for maybe this is my opportunity i've been selling myself i've been giving myself to this world trying to get enough save that i can start a business or get out of this line of work i'm so embarrassed and i'm so ashamed but all i've got but if i could get to him perhaps that would make a difference and she took her little stash brother branham tells the story so eloquently she takes her little stash out from behind a hidden place in her house or whatever and she goes down and she buys the most expensive brother benjamin i'd like to start with that i'll lavish my and then we'll go from there whatever the holy spirit leads i don't want us to get stuck on anything she thought if i can just get to him and jesus had come to this party at this big preacher's house the preacher was just waiting for an opportunity to make fun of him he was just waiting he runs with the rabble of the earth he's a renegade he hangs out with these ill-famed women and these guys that don't practice the law right and they don't honor the priest and no they were picking at him but she just wanted to be wherever he was cause she had heard she had heard maybe you've heard the word of god this week and you wonder i wonder if i can just get to his feet today i wonder if i can just crawl up and touch him i won't look him in the eye i won't i'm ashamed but i just get to his feet not only did she get to his feet i imagine brother shelly he didn't twitch i imagine he knew that if he moved a finger it would scare her and i don't know if she unclasped his sandals or not but i kind of think she did and maybe her hair was excuse me maybe it was pinned back but i i think she was crying so much that she didn't need water and jesus just sat there and let that ill-famed women wash woman excuse me wash and kiss his feet and then she began to wipe his feet off with her long hair she began to get all muddy and messy i can only imagine she oh she lavished and she took the most expensive box of oil that she could afford and she poured it on him and she began to lavish the christ with her love so true and as she poured everything she had of this world all of her savings all of her plans all of her desires she began to pour it on him that gentle kind jesus began to do war for that little lady and his skirts covered her oh brother ben when we start to worship i want his train to fill his temple yes i want his skirt to feel i wanted to cover the people i want you to stand at the feet of your king today i want you to be so full of the holy ghost when you leave this building today you will never be the same [Music] john wrote and he said from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and verse 6 if you would of chapter 1 of the book of revelation the apocalypse the end he hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever we found my wife and i as we begin to study the word of god together over the last few years we find that the word of god often refers to the male factor especially from the translation from the king james era that sometimes sometimes they lean towards that giving honor in reference to the king of that time king james and so as we begin to study these scriptures and break them down we find out that god didn't just bless men and i didn't get another translation ready for this i'm just sharing this with you under inspiration because my dear sisters the word of god for the day and hour in which we say uh live says it's the word living think about this living word jesus was the messiah brother branham often referred to us as messiah ets he referred to you as mrs jesus christ you are the bride of the king of heaven i believe my friend knows that god refers to us as his beloved if they'd have only looked he was messiah he was the living word made manifest and a man that's got the spirit of god in him or a woman lives that word right lives right out in them that's the heartbeat [Music] the predestinated for the word of the lord comes to them [Music] they are the word to the people written epistles you my children my friends my family this church we are the word of god made manifest in 2022. i preached several weeks ago when i was here jesus told his disciples have i been so long with you and you didn't know me as brother shelley ministered so long to us has our pastor become common has the presence of the lord departed from him has the glory of the lord lost its glow to us do we honor and reference the gift do we see jesus in the man of god do we see jesus when we get up in the morning to go to work tomorrow do we make sure jesus is there do we leave for work and we say oh jesus i see you please touch someone with me today i believe sister flo under inspiration of the holy spirit told my son-in-law i am jealous of you hallelujah i believe jealousy jesus stands on that other side of this dimension and he's jealous of any of us that gets to touch his children i believe he's jealous of any of us that gets to bless his children oh yes i believe he is jealous because you get to be his hands sister i got to tell you i hope my kids know why the organ now is my favorite instrument you took me someplace when you were playing that organ it has always spoke to me but today today i got to hear it once again like i remember hearing it when i was a child it took me some place into the ramparts of glory and it spoke to me and for a moment i felt the skirt of his robe passed by thank you lord it will and if you'll spend just a few minutes before you go out to eat maybe a few minutes before brother forrest tells you a testimony or my mom or brother shelly if you'll spend just a few more minutes and let his robe pass by his robes will touch you he will take a tong off the al from and grab fire off the altar and you can go out here as a servant of the lord man or woman he can cleanse you today you can get filled up with the holy ghost you can get faith you can get virtue you can get temperance you can get patience you can get godliness you can get that brotherly kindness and god can put the seal of the holy ghost the love of god on your life that when you touch people you will change their life and if you ever start to air if you ever start to falter if like oh brother joshua when he began to take city after city he found himself in trouble because one day 16 men died and joshua had been told that he would not lose one man and he went and he told god what's going on why are we failing why are we slipping and god said there's sin in the camp somebody has done contrary to what i said you wonder why our families are in disarray you wonder why our marriages are falling apart we must we must fill back the tent get the babylonian gold out of our homes out of our lives so that we can be so full of the holy ghost that as we begin to lavish he's not embarrassed by our worship he's not embarrassed by our praise but that he comes up as a sweet smelling savor to him that's right and he comes walking through our midst and his robe touches us and just at the touch of the hem of his garments need supply free knee supplied i can't remember any of the rest of the words healing yep she got healing and blessing that's all we got brother ben here judah let's do our job thank you all for the weekend i hate to leave tomorrow i'll be back just as fast as i can get home sister stacy we love you thank you for your labor this weekend thank you for your service [Music] [Applause] i told my brother shelley i've seen very few women with the call of god on their life that serve any better to serve any better i thank god for that i thank god for these children that set aside time these bands the young people in the back that try to help me i needed help if i don't thank you properly we'll get to it we'll we'll fry some kosher fish when i get back i can fry fish but right now brother

getting ready to close we want to thank every one of you for being here i know that the lord is minister to you our sister has brought a flyer for us and i want to mention it to you this is a annual tent meeting that is held at brother henry simmons church bride tabernacle of jesus christ church in columbia south carolina you don't know any of these preachers that are going to be preaching so you will have to go and get acquainted with them brother isaiah brooks nobody knows him around here i just hate what i've done to this to his tambourine i beat a hole in it last night paul's gonna have to buy him another one we're not gonna throw that one away though cause he signed it for us i can't believe i put my big old hand right through it last night and brother farmer you've got a son not only do you have a daughter that can sing so anointed but you've got a son that preaches the message of the hour sister anna's brother cliff farmer from arkansas is going to be preaching in that meeting as well if he's got a last name farmer every farmer i know that preaches can preach so you you you will be blessed and uh many of us know brother keith reed who is a wonderful brother from jamaica i know all three of these preachers and i know brother henry simmons these meetings are going to be hell we'll put this we'll post it but july the 28th 29th 30th and 31st thursday through sunday morning all i know is every time i see brother bill johns he says you really ought to go to brother henry simmons's tent meeting he does his finger like that you really ought to go he said cause not only do they preach to you they feed you real good that's what he tells me i guess he figures i look like i would go for that if if nothing else so we will put that back there and if you could get there i know i know you'd be blessed it's real special actually to me because when i first heard the testimony that was given as brother miller was sharing little my testimony when i received the message i was alone alone and wasn't sure exactly what to do because i was losing people left and right and one day the phone rang and it was brother henry simmons and he said now you don't know me but i've heard some good things about you and what god has showed you and he said me and another brother we're going to ride down and spend the day with you and it was brother henry simmons and brother isaiah brooks so i appreciated their friendship and them coming to stand by me and help me to prepare myself that i would probably lose everybody and then god would start adding them back those that were hungry for the word and he was faithful he's keeping us all in his care isn't he so would you stand we want to just just again remember our brother and ask that god would renew his strength and bless him what an honor to have his friends so many of his friends with us and family his mom and dad his mother-in-law and father-in-law two daughters his son-in-law and little grandbaby and families that have meant so much to him through the years thank you so much for being here god bless you and your sacrifice we will have lunch you are so welcome to stay with us and fellowship and hear brother farmer's testimony you'll tell it as many times as they ask is that right if they'll come up he will give it to you and if you haven't heard it you need to hear it it's very very powerful we will need a few minutes some will have to go and get their warming food and bring it here but if you'll hang around and fellowship love one another there'll be a meal i don't know how long it'll be but as soon as they can get it and get it together it will be available for you stay in fellowship as long as you can if you can't stay we understand but we want you to know you're more than welcome father our hearts are full your grace is sufficient and you have proven yourself faithful to us to minister to all of our needs your word has ministered to us you have spoken to us we have seen lives transformed and we give you honor and glory for that bless our fellowship today when we eat natural food together lord let it be blessed and sanctified for the nourishment of our body as we share our testimonies one with another and fellowship one with another let your presence remain with us we pray o god that nothing would be able to disturb the atmosphere but your love would just flow through your people today oh god we thank you our hearts are truly full we ask these blessings in the name of the lord jesus christ and for his glory amen amen amen you are dismissed to go today in the name of the lord and as you go out less singing to god let's sing to god be the glory [Music] to god be the glory to god be the glory to god [Music] for the things he has done with his blood he has saved me with his power he has raised me to god be the glory for the things he has done god bless you as you go to god be all the glory to god the glory yes to god be all the glory for the days he has done and with his blood he has saved me with his power he has raised me to god beyond the glory for the things he oh has god be the glory to god be all the glory to god you
