asking the Lord to help her today let's continue to remember Sister Flo and her entire family the entire Hendrick's family that God will strengthen them and help them through the minute by minute life you know the the here and there of life that God will continue to help them I I know of two families that need the Lord to be with them in the process of closing real estate contracts and we're believing that the Lord is in it and that he is going to make a way Lord and then I know of a couple of families who are uh Desiring to be closer and need the Lord to move on their behalf and I believe he will one of those families is is the Millers and they they from from Missouri and God's moving for them he is and the next few days are critical so we're believing that this this is a a manye dream I saw a memory where 11 years ago sister Martha was was lifting up and thanking God for her pastor 11 years and I think it was longer than that that they've been a part of this ministry

job nobody wants to be miserable on their job it's not a party folks so it may not always be fun but nobody wants to be miserable day after day on their job where they want to you know hide in the bed almost like a little child they want to have some pleasantness to it if at all possible and brother Billy has been in great pain for some time now and he is going this week for surgery on Tuesday is

awesome in power Our God he's our God and if our God is for us then who could ever stop us and if our God is with us then what can stand against and if our God is for us then who could ever stop us and if our God is with us then what can stand [Music] again what can stand again oh and our God is great our God is stronger my God is so much higher than any father and our God is healer he's awesome

could ever stop us and if our God is with us tell me what can stand again walk can stand [Music] again who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yeay rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all of these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded I am persuaded that neither death nor life life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord nothing shall separate us the enemy is on a rampage but he cannot separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus because my Lord he went to Calvary and when he got done at Calvary he descended into the lower parts of the earth and he took the keys of death and hell and the grave and he is in possession of them today and he said that we were in him I am in him today and I have in me a Grace to overcome death and hell and the grave because Jesus lives on the [Music] inside death can't separate me neither can tribulation separate me it may distract me for a while but it cannot separate me and so I make the conscious choice to take that distraction and put it in its place yes the distractions that come even when God is moving all around me I make the conscious choice to say distractions you cannot have the preeminence Jesus Christ The Living Word is here to have the preeminence and I agree with the Living Word to have preeminence in my life Hallelujah and if our God is for us who could ever stop us and if our God is with us then what can stand against then if our God is for us then who could ever stop us and if our God is with us then what can stand again walking stand again oh sing Our God our God is greater is greater s our God is stronger God you are higher than any other Oh Our God is healer awesome awesome in power Our God our god oh oh he's our God he's our God why don't we give the Lord a hand clap of praise the Bible tells us the Bible tells us to do it the scripture said clap your hands oh ye people and shout unto God with the voice of Triumph Hallelujah the Lord live he liveth he liveth you may be seated he lives he lives yes aren't you glad you know that Jesus Lives you all SWAP back would you we are so thankful for the presence of the Lord that has been in this service already yes we realized that by now a lot of churches would be getting ready to dismiss but we're not so you need to know that we appreciate all of you being here we didn't know if Sister Flo would feel strong enough to be here today but not only did she make it pressing in to get here she she got a blessing and I'm so thankful for that I know she's very thrilled to have family with her especially Jessica who we haven't seen in some time until this week weekend but um she's just so precious to us and so easy to talk to that's what we think about sister Flo's Jesse is that is that uh she's easy to talk to Sister Pam thank you so much for being here today she was so kind to us at the funeral she knows that as a body we're going through a little something in the church and she was so kind at the funeral we were so glad to spend some time with her and we uh my wife encouraged her to be here today and I was in the background saying we need you we need you we need you to be there and I meant it especially at that moment I meant it and I mean it this morning thank you for making the extra effort to be here today all of you it's good to be in God's house there's no place that I would rather be than in the presence of the Lord we can thank God we can experience his presence wherever we are but when we come together in his name like this we we have an opportunity to experience it him on a different level aren't you thankful for that amen uh we are in a prophetic season that we have been marking for many years now thank God we only have two more days it's called by various things but it has been marked historically as an extremely difficult time for God's people particularly the Jewish people but you and I have a a spiritual inheritance and we are maybe not all of us are a part of the natural Seed of Abraham but we recognize that we are part of the spiritual seed the Royal Seed of Abraham and we're thankful for that we identify thankfully and proudly with that Royal seed if you look at history uh this 3- week period i is a time that has been marked down Through the Ages it has various names some have referred to it as the season of the Basilisk that sounds a little uh you know mythical to some people the Jewish people often call it the Dire Straits the season of the of the strain there are all kinds of things and if you look at this 3-week period that will end uh Tuesday on Tish Beav which is the day that the temple was destroyed not one time but two times and uh you that thank God that's the end of it but if you watch this uh period through history you'll find that great persecution and adversity has always been a part of this season uh exactly why we don't know but but we'll tell you this if something becomes a tradition or if something becomes uh sort of a habitual occurrence the enemy will take advantage you know if you're a person that says you know maybe you're just talking to somebody and you say you know uh every every month or every other month around the middle of the month I just get the blues well when you say that you you actually open the door you you you actually invite depression and heaviness to come or sometimes people will say you know my precious old grandmother Every Spring she would get sort of a fever and she would get so low and and and so blue and so down and I've noticed that in the spring of the year I have to fight the same thing well every time you say something like that the enemy is listening we as a church believe that the enemy cannot read your mind I know there's a lot of people that think he can live in your head and read your mind I don't believe that I don't find any Scripture that tells me he can read my mind but he doesn't have to because the reality is most of us talk too much anyway and whatever we think we say are you with me and so he already knows when to hit us and when to when when to hit us below the belt and so I'll be very thankful we we haven't mentioned it in church simply this time because we didn't want to invite anymore uh but we have marked it as a body uh we have there have been Visionary experiences to help us to remember this time and um one of the things that the enemy likes to do if you liken this season to the season of the Basilisk the Basilisk was perhaps a mythological type creature like a a dragon or or a unicorn um and it it was known in fact it's been in history for so many years it appears in in in many ancient manuscripts as a creature this is a little plain now so hold on that that likes to uh take advantage of uh I'm going to try to say it not nice to take advantage of of young Offspring before they're hatched you know can I just say it like a country boy it's known for liking to suck eggs and it's it's been historically recorded and so this has been something that has been marked in Judaism for so many years because it seems to be for whatever reason a season that that the enemy likes to attack things that are uh growing in embryonic form seed form things that have not fully developed and we can get we could take the whole service I'm not going to but we could take the whole service and talk about when the enemy sees the potential I mean he knows what an egg is he knows what new life is he knows that that's what keeps a uh a species going forward and uh it's it's particularly cruel you know to wait till the mother is off the nest you know there's uh snakes that will do the same thing and they will sometimes put their fangs in the in the egg and through the holes uh uh eat out the egg suck out the egg and it sounds just like the devil I know people are watching this and you're going crazy and you're saying well brother brandom never talked about that and so there couldn't be anything to it and whatever well don't try to tell the Jewish people that because it was also during that period of time that the that the Spaniards drove the Jewish people out of the country with such a fer fervor during the Spanish Inquisition that they nearly marched them right into the sea to drown they were so determined to get them out of their country and you know you think that is such a foreign thought of of of long ago but I want you to know there's a demon of hatred in this nation absolutely who could absolutely get that wild we're actually acquainted of with a young man uh or a man relative of someone who has been a part of this ministry for some time who lives in a neighborhood uh somewhere in the Northeast is it New York or I'm talking about the the cousin or the nephew that that was physically uh beat up in New Jersey uh because he welcomed a Jewish Family into the neighborhood that was all he did he's not a Jew he just welcomed a Jewish Family into the neighborhood because there was such an uproar about them moving into the neighborhood that he showed them a welcoming spirit and they and they nearly beat beat the life out of him and and so that kind of hatred I is could certainly reappear in fact it's on the scene and we know it so whatever you think about these things remember that the enemy knows that God is forming something in your life and if he can come in and steal in a slick Sly slimy deceitful hissing way that's exactly what he will do he he doesn't want really really really he he he knows that he doesn't have power to kill you I know there are people people out there who believe that the that the devil kills people all the time I don't believe that it's not scriptural we believe in the sovereignty of God we believe the enemy can't even touch you unless God allows him to by you opening the door now does he want to sure he'd like to but he's beg to learn that he doesn't have as much power as he would like to have he has the power you give him he has the power that the bride yields to him and so what he would then like to do is leave you an empty shell he he would like to take your vision your purpose your call you know your why the vision of your life the goal of your life uh the the ministry what what you desire to do for God and he would like to suck that out of you I know it's a forgive the analogy is so plain but he would like to suck the life out of you and leave you a walking a dead a zombie you know who has no real life just a shell of a man but but we're here to tell you today that if you're filled with the Holy Spirit greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and as long as you don't fear that devil and recognize who you are in Christ you can beat him back every single time time and this is our responsibility and we must do it with everything that we have I didn't see any birthdays on the calendar other than sister Anita Christian and uh of course she's not with us on Sunday mornings but uh hopefully she will see this and know that we love her and we wish her the best of birthdays this week and maybe maybe we'll see them on Tuesday night uh I know that we've had enough singing I don't want to say too much singing but I made such a mess of the song um at the funeral that I want to sing it again uh here uh with my own uh instruments I hope he doesn't hear this cuz he told me that he streams our service but sometime but I told the pastor when I got out at the grave I I said you know why don't you tell that boor but because I've been told for years that property's paid off and so forth several people told us they don't owe any have any debt and I said why don't you talk to that bored about getting you all a better sound system because it would be a great blessing and he said well that's the first time has ever done that I said oh no it did it about three years ago when I was preaching here so maybe I'm the problem and not the sound system so let me try make sure I can hear myself hwk if you have to help uh help Luke you you had it up Lively the other day so of course it sounds pretty good now but let's go I was so blessed to have marbeth to help and Kate we ask him to jump up and help and Benjamin on the drums

strength to the family and your presence at the viewing uh meant a lot to the family and your presence at the funeral those of you who were able to go and there were some who even made a sacrifice to take off work to be there to support the family and they appreciated it very very much and for your giving today some of you gave online someone contacted me the day after the death and said uh I want to be a part of anything that the church does to bless the family whether it's food or whatever it is and so uh thank you for your giving as well and we look forward to an eternity with brother Garvis Jr and with you so you better make it you better go all the way somebody say amen amen all right would you turn in your Bible this morning and and I'll do my best to not drag this out any longer than we have to but uh I do have some things that I want to get in I want you to turn to 2 Thessalonians if you will chapter 2 verse 11 and 12 we have been on for a couple of weeks now we have been on a series concerning cold love and and the Bible tells us Jesus said it's red letter and he said because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall do what it shall wax cold it shall become Frozen now what you can do with Frozen love I don't know it doesn't help anybody does it it's kind of locked inside of you and love is not something that we hold on to love is something that we give away yes and our most important love relationship is not husband and wife our most import our boyfriend girlfriend but our most important love relationship is with the Lord Jesus Christ and the sooner that you can begin to think of him in that manner and understand the bridal Paradigm the quicker you'll be able to come into h a passionate relationship with him he longs to spend time with us not just on Sunday morning but he longs to be a part of our everyday life if the enemy can bind us with generational iniquities spirits that have traveled down through the generations if the enemy can bind us with that and frees up our love he can affect greatly our relationship with the Lord he he really it's our fellowship that he can hinder the most he can't change our destiny aren't you glad for that and and by doing so church he affects our relationship with one another and with the world around us God's people got to be full of love we have to be full of love and the enemy will do anything and everything he can to freeze that love in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 11 and 12 the Apostle said and for this cause shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness this is the program of the enemy in the last days he wants to so sear men's conscience with a hot iron that they can no longer feel any conviction for their behavior for their lifestyle and because this Antichrist spirit is already in the Earth the apostle was warning us that even in the last days the spirits would mature and they would become so effective in the last days that they would be able to send a strong illusion upon people who did not like to retain the truth of God in their heart and he would give them such a delusion that they would believe a lie and the lie that they would believe would cause them instead of Liberty it would cause them damnation and they will think that they are believing the truth right now we could look at the political situation in this nation and say we know that's possible we know that's possible let me read it to you in the Amplified and then you can have your seat therefore God sends them upon them a misleading influence you know kind of like photoshopping if we were looking at politics that's not what we want to talk about today but kind of like photoshopping a crowd where there is no crowd making people think that this lie is gaining intraction and gaining multitudes of people when the reality is not and what happens in that discourages people from voting their own conscience their own conviction they just say what's the use we're overwhelmed they're going to cheat anyway and blah blah blah blah blah uh that's one thing politics is one Arena but when what the enemy really wants to do is is is rock your world so that you turn loose of Calvary a and and what's the use anyway he'd like to say so God even God had to send a misleading influence a working of error and a strong delusion to make them believe what is false in order that all may be judged and condemned who did not believe in who refused to adhere to trust in and rely on the truth but instead took pleasure in unrighteousness we're not talking about an influence that causes people just to change churches we're talking about a spirit that wants to take people off the word and the Lord spoke to our hearts as we started the series and we're going to pray he spoke to our hearts and he said there are three spirits that the bride is going and I'm sure sure there many more but three were highlighted that the bride is going to have to contend with in the last days one is a religious spirit one is a seducing spirit that brings delusion and another are familiar spirits I'm sure there are many others out there but these were the ones that were highlighted let's pray just a moment father we have used up a lot of our time but we used it giving you glory and honor and praise and so we don't regret any of it this is your time Lord this doesn't belong to family dinner this doesn't belong to birthday celebration this doesn't belong to family reunion this is your time we have set this aside to honor you and to honor your word and to hallow and make holy and reverent your name we recognize that the enemy howls and rages in this hour against our coming together and he offers us excuses to try to get us persuaded not to be here but Lord I want you to know I want you to be very aware of th those who have pushed through those who are standing in your presence today and we are thankful for for you allowing us to have fellowship with you but we're hungry to hear the word of the Lord so we ask that you would bind up distraction and that you would help us to pull with our faith upon the gift of God that you might be able to talk to us in this trying time a time of testing and sifting you are faithful and true and tonight today this afternoon we bless your name and we lift you up in this house we ask for your help in the name of the Lord Jesus J Christ and for his glory we ask it and the church said amen you may be seated so the three spirits that we must contend with in this season of proving number one was a seducing lying Spirit number two was religious spirits and that comes in the form of delusions the prophet of God tells us that of all the evil spirits a Rel religious spirit is one of the most difficult spirits to identify and to deal with because it strengthens itself with the language with the vocabulary with the jargon of Christianity oh it's just a churchy devil it's a churchy spirit it's a spirit that often affects people by causing them to cling to their Traditions while rejecting the word of the Lord amen amen and so uh we wouldn't think particularly that the bride would have to contend with such things but if the enemy can break your fellowship with the with your creator with your lover with your savior if he can break your fellowship with him that's exactly what he wants to do he can just go lay down because that broken Fellowship will bring you into a tail spin he won't have to keep spinning you around life has a way of doing that so if the enemy can cause you to fall under a delusion where you convince yourself that you are right you are following the leadership of a feeling or what people like to say I feel led well you know sometimes uh we we need more than just a feeling to lead us I'm I'm going just I'm going to amen myself just a minute Amen brother Shelly the Bible said it didn't say we're going to be led by feelings because feelings will fail you but the Bible said it's many as are led by the spirit of God these are the sons of God so our leadership is a manifestation of our sunship and so if we're following uh fake media instead of the word of God now you know uh the that that fake Media stuff it doesn't just want to influence uh politics it wants to influence medicine how you look at the medical world and some people are so enamored with doctors and drugs until they believe everything they're told and that's why when I on that rare occasion that I go to the doctor my heart goes out to the seniors because they're sitting there with gallons siiz bags Ziplocs with not two or three bottles 15 20 or more bottles there's no way in the world that a doctor treating all of these conditions in general medicine could keep up up with every small detail of all of the side effects and the dangers of laying One Drug on top of another drug but blindly people heard themselves in on now sacrifice great deals of money to make sure that they've got enough help to pay for the for those prescriptions taking somebody's word that it's going to help them when in in reality many times I'm not against medicine but many times it shortens someone's life they're fighting to Live While poisoning themselves to death that's right but the older you get the more you need to trust somebody or trust something so the enemy uses fake media uh for things like that and and as early as recent as yesterday they have issued great warnings across our nation about the uptake of covid and the the necessity of even the newest uh shot even the newest immunization to to keep that at Bay and it becomes a a gerbal wheel you know I I'm telling you the truth I'm not trying to bash medicine I just want to show you how the enemy can fool people into believing anything that they're told you've got family members you trust and if they tell you something you don't you know they wouldn't lie so it has to be so and you pass it on how many times on social media have you ever seen a post that that is about someone's dire problem their horrible need that they have or something tragic that's happened to them and and someone shares it reshares it but they put a tag at the top that says my cousin know knows this person or my uncle is neighbor to this person anybody ever seen something like that and in reality it's a lie it's fake someone has passed it on and said I know this person why would somebody lie like that if you don't know them why because they feel like if they say they know the person it adds credibility to the situation hello come on so you'll see those photographs of alligators as big as the platform and somebody said my cousin has a fish camp next to this slew where this alligator lives and so everyone believes that there's really an alligator bigger than this platform cuz there's a picture if it's a picture it has to be so right on did you know with AI you can just speak to your computer and tell it what you want to look at do you understand that I could tell uh artificial intelligence to search my photos and find a photo of me and put me at the Red Sea crossing right did you know artificial intelligence has the possibility of doing that so then I could show you this picture and try to convince you that I was really there I know some of you think I'm that old but I wasn't there there do you see how dangerous that stuff can become do you realize that then you can put somebody coming out of a hotel with a hooker that wasn't there I'm just being honest it why would well why would somebody bother to take the time to do that because seducing spirits will convince people you're doing the right thing you're just having fun not thinking about the fact that lives are being ruined so you can't believe everything you read about anybody you can't read everything you can't believe everything you read about President Trump that's right he's a man he puts his pants on like the rest of us Fellers do he's prone to be a human an unregenerated human he's not Christ he's not going to save America he might be able to help us if by Miracle he gets back into some kind of position but he can't save America folks he can't even really make America great again only Jesus Christ could do that because a president can't change the hearts of men and women and I want you to know the ship has sailed on many people wanting anything that has to do with conservative Bible believing or or oldfashioned in Christianity we're in need in our nation and we're in trouble and part of the reason why is the enemy has found all kinds of ways to seduce and to deceive and to lie and offer fake media and they keep telling people for instance I'm on a roll so I'm sorry about that they keep telling people for instance that that we're not in it this is not inflation wow prices are better than they've been in so long how many of you know it's just not true and and they'll tell you you know we inherited the worst economy in history well that might have had a little something to do with the pandemic and the problem is you didn't do much to fix it you've actually ended up making it worse but they will say all kinds of things and unfort fortunately people refuse to look at numbers they'll believe whatever they hear now we're dealing with the same thing in Christianity there are Scholars out there who will take a Hebrew word referring to a young virgin and they will tell you that it doesn't really mean Virgin It Means A young Maiden not necessarily a virgin not necessarily one who hasn't been with a man but just of a certain young age and articles will be written and sermons will be preached and denominations will vote in uh articles of faith and millions of votes will be cast to say we no longer believe in the Virgin birth of the Lord Jesus Christ it's happening there's been great division even in the United Methodist Church and bibles Rewritten and new versions made it's not just a hillbilly new version of the Bible or the redneck new version of the Bible or the ebonic new version of the Bible but people are just writing a Bible to fit their own thoughts and ideas but if it says holy Bible on the front folks it has to be right right no but the enemy can print anything he wants to print on there somebody said for instance you know we don't believe in a Rapture anymore because Rapture is not in the Bible did you know the word bible is not in the Bible somebody said oh yes it is it's on the cover it's on my fly Lea but I want you to know from Genesis 1 all the way to the last verse of Revelation the word word Bible doesn't appear in the scripture that doesn't mean that we can't call it a Bible or Holy Scripture just because the word rapture doesn't appear in the Bible doesn't mean there's not going to be a catching away of the Bride do you understand what I'm saying sir do you know major denominations have accepted the fact and said there's no virgin birth did you know that major denominations have come along and said that the whole concept of Jesus died ding on a cross to pay for someone else's sin could not possibly be right and that the Bible is no more than a book of judgment and there's no life and no love and no hope for those who follow the scripture especially with the thoughts of inherency and if you think that's a handful of people on the backside of Los Angeles who believes that the world Embraces that kind of stuff do you know why because they don't want to have a law to follow they don't want a book of instructions to follow they want to do what's right in their own eyes and in their own minds and the churches are being affected and the gospel is being watered down and who's responsible for it the devil and his pimps which often times are his preachers because they Embrace these lies and spoon feed them to the people and some have you know brother brandham talks about mother being the Fifth Gospel Mar Matthew Mark Luke John mother and the reality is you learn as a child sometime more from your mother than you do Matthew Mark Luke or John so it's important to be a good mother but but I have recently heard that there's a new Fifth Gospel and that it's Matthew Mark Luke John and Google because that's where a lot of people go to get their bearing for what is truth when we have to go to the Bible I'm going to preach now remember study not commentary and dictionary study this scripture to show thyself a Workman that needeth not to be shamed rightly dividing cuz there's a devil out there that wants you to water it down and pass on an abbreviated version somebody ought to fight for the Virgin birth somebody ought to fight for Redemption by the blood of Jesus Christ somebody ought to fight that the church at large is baptizing people under a demonic influence instead of in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Christ somebody stand up and say I'm not I refuse to be baptized in titles when the Bible said that he has chosen a name he has highly exalted a name that everything should be done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ see it's one thing if you Google it and it says that William brandom is a false prophet but if you keep reading you're going to find out that it will also eventually tell you that the book of Acts is the end of the of the dispensation of Miracles and gifts and Supernatural living if you keep reading it will convince you it will seek to convince you that God is three persons and that totally contradicts the word somebody said the words of a prophet I I'm not interested in that right now it contradicts the words of Jesus Christ Our Messiah our Lord when he said you've got to get this straight you religious Crooks when you've seen me well I said we want to see the father he said H I've been with you all this [Music] time ain't that interesting he said you you've had him with you the whole time and you've refused ref used to see him because you wanted him to be an old man with white hair and a and a gavel sitting on a judge's bench or you wanted him to be some ethereal cloud or you wanted him to look like this or that or the other so when he came in a body of Flesh you didn't even know who he was you students of the law you religious Hypocrites you didn't even know him when he walked among you no wonder he said you're nothing more than whed supplers but on the inside you're Graves full of dead men's bones your religion is going to damn you because you fail to see the truth it stands before you come on there's only one scripture in the Bible that even mentions the three other than the titles and that's a scripture that says there are three that bear record in heaven I I have no problem with that that's the word says the Father the word and the spirit father son Spirit father word spirit and don't forget you folks now trying to talk us out of the Oneness of God don't forget the rest of the scripture somebody said but the there was a voice and somebody said there was a dove and somebody said who was he praying to it's so easy to get caught up in craziness but the rest of that verse said and these three are three these three are one you've got three different Offices here you've got three different manifestations here but in the end there's only one Spirit if we've got more than one Spirit to worship I'm very confused with what the scripture teaches there's one Jesus had a father somebody said who was the father and the church says the father but the Bible didn't say that the Bible said and the Holy Ghost overshadowed Mary and she conceived the Lord Jesus Christ so who is the father of the Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost then how could there not be two because there's only one spirit in the first place according to the scripture the min Ministry is different the office is different the administration may be different but here o Israel the Lord our God is one but the enemy and somebody says if you don't believe in the Trinity you are not even Christian aren't you glad they don't get to decide what kind of relationship you have with him I've been told now for 4 40 years that because I don't have a Christmas tree I'm not a Christian so the world must have a very loose definition of what it takes to be a Christian if you don't mind I'll just stay with the word I'm not looking to the Fifth Gospel of Google I'm looking to the inherency of the scripture all men can make mistakes all men can miss speak all men can mislead all men can exaggerate and embellish the truth you don't even have to be a preacher to be to embellish the truth fishermen do it all the time you can't trust that but thanks be to God there is something that is such an absolute that no matter what's going on politically the word is the same no matter what's going on in every other Arena of Life the word Remains the Same when men are fighting to interpret the message that was supposed to help us understand the word and they're fighting over it to the point of calling one another's name and spitting in Anger at one another and damning each other to serpent seed there is a word there is a scripture there is a holy Bible there is a book come on now that never changes itself it never has to update itself praise be to God it remains a constant it's like the North Star it doesn't move you always can know that that's the right direction you can always know you're standing in truth when you're standing on the word somebody ought to say Amen well you're really wild this morning I am because he said that one of the spirits the bride would have to deal with was seducing spirits and delusional spirits who would make them believe all kinds of crazy things like the resurrection of a prophet who has to come back and ride in an airplane and pitch a tent and do all kinds of things in order for the word of God to be fulfilled folks if it's not in the book it doesn't matter who aunt Suzie Beth had a dream doesn't matter what preacher had a vision if it can't line up with the word this little bride will never will'll never swallow it we've heard that we've heard something in this message that Echoes to us a great truth get in Step stay in St you don't get your eyes on voice of God recording you get your eyes is on the Lord sir someone recently who was a member of this church some years ago recently told one of our members I'm aligned with Brother Joseph I said I hope somebody will tell her you better get in alignment with Jesus Christ you better know that you've got a relationship with him you don't have to go through in this hour I may be making enemies here you don't have to go through a Prophet to get to Jesus he wants to have fellowship with you now when you want to start understanding the word like you've never understood it before God sent a message he sent a messenger with a message and we haven't changed our mind I know where I would be without this message and messenger but I have been able to come this far now because my eyes were not on a man you know he said that remember he said that remember he said don't pay any attention to the messenger he said it's the message that's going to get the bride out of here he said I make way too many mistakes he said I was just thinking of a mistake just recently something I got a little twisted up he said but but he never he never fails he never oh thank God somebody said well we don't know these men that interp we don't know these men that translated the Bible and we don't know folks the holy spirit of God in you will tell you this word is right and if you have confidence in a prophet hear what he said he said that's the absolute that's what we're standing on come on now and while many people called The Church ages and the seals the revelation of Jesus Christ he said the truth revealed from Genesis to Revelation he said that's the revelation of Jesus Christ it's revealed in the book hello are you stirred yeah I'm stirred I'm stirred I am stirred we're living in an hour where you better get stirred second uh second Thessalonians chapter 2 beginning in verse three this time he said let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except that is Amplified I want the uh uh I want the King James I think let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first are you with me and the man excuse me and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition that sounds pretty serious doesn't it who oppos and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God as potentate as Pope sets himself in the temple of God showing himself that he is God here's one thing you can't deny I know I added a word forgive me go straight back to the absolute but here's one thing you can't deny the the very theme of Pap Rome is in the stead of God right if I were to tell you that you should listen to brother brandham instead of God wouldn't that be a Antichrist Spirit if I should tell you that you should take something that you hear on a tape that you have so much confidence in but if there's something on that tape that's contrary to the Bible somebody said I don't think there will be you might be surprised if there is something there that's contrary to the Bible and I say I'm going to believe this no matter what the Bible said wouldn't that be a part of that Antichrist Spirit you see that's where the foolish virgins are going to be found they're not just going to be be found out there among the denominations they don't make it that far they're going to be found among those who know the way but don't get the the oil you're going to have to have that's quiet it doesn't matter I I I'm I'm very confident in what I'm saying you're going to have to have the Holy Ghost and it's going to have to be more than snot and slobber you're you're going to have to know that he has anchored in your soul in your spirit until you have found new strength to shun the devil and to resist the temptation that has haunted you your entire life the prophet tells us one thing about knowing that we've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he he believed that the sign or the evidence of that was being able to say Amen to every word of God so around the message they seem to think that if you just a minute it's getting tight in here if you just a minute you got the Holy Ghost do you think that's really what he was telling us somehow I don't think so because the scripture tells us that the Devils the demons believe and tremble and that means if possible or necessary they could even say Amen why they could probably amen any preacher preaching but let me tell you something about demons they can't live the life they can't produce the life of Jesus Christ no matter how hard they try it's not in them to live a reproducible resurrection it's not in them to manifest the attributes of Christ so they may holler amen and they may feel something but that's not what this final test is going to be about this final test is going to be about whether or not you can am in it with your life cuz there's a lot of pools hello there's a lot of pools out there there's a lot of apps that people can get on their phone there's a lot of access that you can have to filth you no longer have to walk in the 7-Eleven and buy the magazine you no longer have to go down to the smut houses to buy the junk Amazon will bring you the filth your telephone will bring you the filth amen your integrity matters it's not what you do when you get in here let's see if we can get some help it's what you're doing when nobody's looking when nobody sees your account when nobody monitors your orders you think you think because you chose a a a discreet shipping come on now I've been told it's offered that way if you'd like to get your filth you can you can specify let it come in in discrete packages well that wouldn't do me any good if I was trying to cheat like that because it don't matter what name is on the package in my house if it comes from Amazon everybody in the house opens it somebody said well how would they do that not knowing that they've got an order they got an order all of them everybody there's hardly ever a time that somebody in the house hadn't ordered something from Amazon so if I was trying to sneak something filthy in the house you'd think well if it was in your name you know you could be oh no no no no no no no no I not only have the Holy Ghost I got a big old family around me all the time checking up on me or whatever you might call it afraid that it's their package and not come on you know the enemy is slick it's not because you come over here and amen your pastor thank you for doing it I need it I'm I'm depending on it this morning and always but it's can you live this [Music] life what kind of language are you using when nobody's around that knows your church history what are you guzzling when nobody else is [Music] around what do you drink I've asked preach what do you drink on the airplane when nobody's around we had the spirit of the Lord come here one time in the middle of one of our camp meetings and call out a preacher who had been taking a toddy on the airplane nobody on the plane knew him except the one that matters the most but the enemy told him you're under pressure you're in stress you know you you got nerves and you got a lot going on and that'll just take the edge off the devil's A sly old fox come on here's that Spirit of antichrist so much like the real that's right so all of you who like to mention about how that the Great imans and the black popes of of of Islam and and and all these uh are going to come along and lead the the move of the Antichrist and how it's going to be Islam you are so fooled it's there there's not a person in the right mind that thinks that that Islam is so close to Christianity that you could almost mix up the the two and the scripture said when that Spirit comes it's going to be so much like the real that even the elect would be deceived if it were possible anybody in this house that can't tell the difference between Islam and Christianity you're in bad shape brother so it's going to be something even much closer than that isn't it it's going to be something that talks about Jesus and the blood and drinking communion and come on it's going to be something very close and it's not just going to monopolize one church or one organization that Spirit of course is going to lead and that church is going to lead and and we understand how political Rome and Papal Rome joined together in the last days we understand that but if you think that's the only place the Antichrist spirit is going to operate Bible tells us that it's already in the earth in the time of the writing of the Epistles the spirit of iniquity doth already work the Bible said and he that now lth will let Holy Ghost restrain her until he be taken out of the way you think your neighbors are insane you think people walking around in Walmart in their in their boxer shorts are insane you think them people walking around with holes in every part of their body and chains connecting them a man and and and something walking in with a chain on their nose connected do a chain on on on something's nose you don't even know what it is you think that's insane you haven't seen the insanity that's headed to planet Earth you're part of the reason that's holding it at Bay right now but one of these days you and the Holy Ghost are getting out of here and when you do you're not going to want a front row seed to planet Earth in the Bible tells us what it I wished I had some help the spirit sits in the temple of God showing himself that he is God remember ye not that when I was with you I told you these things and now ye know that withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now lth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth that's the end of this thing and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming that's the second coming that's not the Rapture that's the second coming on the other end of the last part of the tribulation period when when he's going to come so brightly that all the armies of of the Antichrist and all the armies of Darkness are going to perish at the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lers lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because why why why were they so vulnerable why did they so easily fall victim to the seducing spirits of hell because they receive not the love of the truth I'm going to say it again because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved somebody said brother Shelley are you really that quick to put people out folks I'm not even preaching about putting people out that has nothing to do with what I'm saying I don't see anybody I want to put out that's not even in my heart what I want to do is make sure that you don't follow the slippery slope I have no control over what you read or what you watch or what you spend your time doing but I can tell you this right now if you're spending all your time watching anti- videos against this truth and you're not spending any time in the word you're not unburdening yourself you're fooling yourself that's what you're doing because the only way to know what's false is to get a better look at what's real just a minute I'm going to help you you're you're just not doing too good this morning if I'd have been sitting here and someone would have said that one I and I was listening to a preacher say something that good I here's what I'd have done wo tell it then I no no not now you're late you're too late too late keep it I just wanted you to know what I'd have done because here is how we're built there's something on the inside I told this Tuesday night let me tell it again and move on we got to close brother but let me tell this I told this Tuesday night maybe you didn't understand it so because of all the talk it's been going on for years now uh I'm a little bit of a packrat and a little bit of a collector collector is a much nicer word um just use that word Jessica if you ever need it just say I'm a I'm a I'm a collector I use it a lot and uh anyway that excuses the junk if you're collecting and and brother green told me years ago he said you know I made it a habit in my life to buy every book that mentioned brother brandom's name and and and he had a whole Library there of all the books that mentioned I've seen the seen the library don't know where it is now but I've seen it all the books and magazines and letters and things like that that that that he could get a hold of that mentioned brother bram's name and I said but brother green I remember standing there in the early 90s before his before collection expanded because there was a whole lot less negative being written back then than there is now and I looked there at and I said but brother green this book right here is very very critical of the ministry of brother brandom he said yes I don't discriminate he said if there's a book negative I want to have it too he said I ought to know what said didn't seem to sway him did it he seemed to me to die believing the same thing he believed when he started but he said look F you don't he said you don't have to be afraid of having that in your library there uh Steve he said because one day somebody might question you on that and you may have to stand there in front of them and say I have no clue is going to make you look like an idiot so you may have to have it so I've been doing that all these years and uh for about 10 years there were so many things being written about brother brandom in a positive way that I I lost track of some of them so many of the charismatics and Pentecostals were trying to embrace the power that they saw in his ministry not what he said of course not but they wanted the mantle they wanted the power they wanted the Miracles they wanted to be able to tell people the secrets of their heart so I am a little bit behind in that but I have bought negative and I've had a b over the past two weeks uh just about every day Amazon has brought me something else negative so I went through the boxes and I said I I'm just going to to choose one and and try to get through it and pray over myself and plead the blood of Jesus but I'm going to try to get through this book I don't suggest that anyone do that unless you're spending Ample Ample time in the word I feel like I'm doing pretty good in that regard not to brag but so I thought I would take time to to go through some of it and here's here was my experience this was a book that wanted to point out the unscriptural teachings of the message of the hour and it's amazing to me that when they were trying to prove the unscriptural teachings of the message of the hour that they left out a whole lot of verses come on now no no no no no no no no when I gave you the teaching on Christmas I didn't just come here and give you all the negative quotes that brother Brandon made did I I brought you the positive ones too and anybody in their right mind saw that he was more against it than for it just by measuring the two so I think if you're going to present something as unscriptural you can't leave out scriptures that seem to support what you're calling unscriptural so so I sit down I don't make a big too of it I sit down in my broken recliner and I start reading and I think I'm going to read this you know I'm going to read this like I'm somebody I'm going to read this like like somebody who's just really examining this and I know before it's over I'm probably going to find something that's going to hurt my feelings a little bit but I'll be all right it's not about emotion it's about truth so I prepare myself and uh the first paragraph I read is talking about one of those horrible unscriptural unorthodox unchristian uh Gnostic type ideas that brother Brandon preached that weren't in the scripture and and I want you to know that the more I read the more excited I got because I could clearly see you've left out anything remotely positive you've only given me the negative and even at the end of the day that is exactly what I believe so if it's Gnostic if it's unorthodox if it's not main stream on now and you can't even call it unscriptural if you leave out the scriptures that teach it so what I had was fake media what I had in my hand was a rag and really its value to me is less than TP do do I I need to help you with that Kade you follow me everybody follow me that's tissue paper cuz I was growing up as I was growing up I wasn't allowed to say toilet I was only allowed to say water closet so water closet paper that doesn't seem to have quite the shock value of TP right it's value to me ended up being less I wished I had my 20 bucks back but I'm a collector you you've got to understand folks that it doesn't matter what kind of a description they hang on it if there's something on the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of you that says you may not see that in the word but I do and I can't apologize because I see it I don't want to apologize because I see it I see it because I was ordained to see it I see it because I was born to see [Music] it and I can't apologize for that so if your families or your neighbors want to hang on you a title you know uh a cult an unorthodox Church nonmainstream Christianity Church don't even let it slow you down you can't open somebody else's eyes but you'd be a fool to try to close your eyes when the Holy Ghost has opened your eyes to this word it's a dangerous slope because we grew up in Pentecost taught that if you made fun of somebody shouting that that was the epitome of blasphemy of the Holy Ghost brother brandom even said that some people have gazed on those who were in the spirit with some critical judgment some harsh you know opinion in their in their gazing and he said gone he said they've done black blasphemed but I want you to know that blasphemy of the Holy Ghost is much more you don't have to be in a church where people shout or jump or run around to blaspheme the Holy Ghost the basic biblical definition of the only sin that is unpardonable you know it's not it's not divorce it's not it's not being married twice that's not God's original plan I'm not going to pretend like it is it's not I'm not ashamed to tell you it's not God's plan but that's not an unpardonable sin or homosexuality is hard for us to comprehend it it's not an unpardonable sin it's sick but it's not unpardonable and I'll be honest with you a man that lays down with a dozen different women is just as sick to me that's right I'm not trying to defend either or I'm just telling you you you don't have to be uh somehow involved with the same gender for to be filthy oh come on preacher tell us you don't have to buy my lunch but there is a sin that Jesus said is not going to be forgiven you in this world or the world to come blasphemy sins against the Holy Spirit and what that is from scriptural uh uh definition is attributing the works of God to the devil giving credit to the devil for what God has done doesn't that sound a whole lot easier to do than just mocking somebody who's running up there I'm just telling you what the Bible teaches us it means so we need to be very careful what we say it matters what we say it matters what we believe are you helping me preach it matters who we give credit for what we see happening among us to say that was the devil when indeed it was God doing it because God doesn't often have to explain himself to you or me we know that he works in the perimeters of his word but we know that he is uh he is only bound to his character to his attributes to who he is we know that there are things that God is capable of that are not recorded oh where'd you get that from the gospels the Bible tells us that the world could not contain the volume of the books if everything that Jesus accomplished in his Earthly Ministry were recorded on paper the whole world wouldn't hold the book so that means there are things that God is capable of that we may not have verse and chapter for so we should be very careful how we call the things of God of the devil very very careful because the enemy wants to fool us oh oh thank God we don't have to fear amen if it were possible I I heard um I Heard the one of the services at the youth camp in Ohio this week and I heard uh uh a young Pastor say something very powerful he was talking he was preaching a message called impossible it's impossible and and and while I might not agree with everything that I heard I know that it is commonly accepted teaching around the message but what really struck me was this concept of being able to fall and get back up that's biblical very biblical the prophet tells us from the word we can fall we can fail we can slide away that doesn't mean we're lost that's right I need you to know that you don't have to say amen I just need to know that you know that it's important for me to know that you know that and we can change our mind what we fight today we might Embrace tomorrow but we better make sure that we're embracing what the word says correct you see there was a time I became so overwhelmed with the life and the behavior of those who claimed this truth that I boxed up the tapes and I put them in the top of the closet and I said I don't want anything else to do with that because if that produces this right now that was very unfair of me but I did it and I'm not lost and I didn't blaspheme because God saw my heart and he knew that you can't judge a truth only by the people who claim to follow it because if that were the case Christianity is a shame if we judge Jesus by the quacks that follow him say they say they follow him if if if if we could judge Jesus by by uh those who carry the Bible under their arm and say we're standing on the word if if we could judge Jesus by those uh uh uh uh nearly senseless people who stand across the street mocking dead soldiers in the name of Baptist Church mocking moms and dads who go to bury their soldiers telling them they died in vain supporting America and they're screaming in Hell or who go to funerals of people that have been murdered because they were practicing a homosexual lifestyle and were murdered for that and this Christian church with Baptist stuck on their name go there and scream at people coming to the funeral and tell them they're all going to hell and and that the gay person deserved hell and should have died and gone to hell and they do it in the name of Jesus and they put on their signs scriptures if that is a reflection of Jesus or the Bible I really wouldn't want any part of that would you cuz that's not how Jesus ministered to the sick and need hello but we're not going to hold Jesus responsible or accountable for everybody that names his name and we can hold this message responsible for all the quacks and the idolators that some of us have met through the years because in the midst of all that chaos and confusion and messed up folk there is a remnant bride that is held on to the word that is held on to the truth of the message there's a remnant bride who's not following this word because of a cloud or because of a bridge or because of some other sign or wonder we follow it because it lines up with the Bible the absolute word of God you'll never ever defeat the Devil with a picture of William brandom but you can defeat him every time with the word of God you'd be foolish to try to hold up your pastor's picture and say look at there devil why he'd eat you and I both for lunch if he could don't be mad please folks don't fall into stupidity in this last hour somebody said well this you know that couldn't be a real Church a message couldn't be a real one cuz they don't have Brother brandom's picture I I've got one in my office if you need to see it but when you come here we didn't start out all those years ago to build a church where you could sit while the preacher was preaching and stare somebody who's not with us anymore you might you don't have to be here Tuesday night my bills are almost paid for this month my big payments are out of the way you might also notice you don't see a picture of Jesus if you were if we were catholic we'd make sure to put Jesus up there and and apostles and mother Mary and brother brandom and somebody said well there was a crucifix on the pull pit at the brandom Tabernacle why don't you have a crucifix on here because for any of you that don't know the news he ain't on the [Music] cross somebody said where is he in heaven no Hallelujah I know where Jesus is he's living in his wife he's living and breathing and moving in his bride he's the same yesterday today and forever he's not a historical document he's a living [Applause] reality thank you I might say much better in the message Discerning the body of the Lord Chaka Ohio Jesus said as it were in the days as it was in the days of Sodom the police and the homicides and all that just go on the go all the time breaking up boys living together as husband and wife women living the the same way perverted their minds their filthy Minds because they don't have all is a lust and a filth and they can't satisfy themselves listen even with one another they don't even marry that's an hour we're living in they don't even marry they just take up and go out until they're perverted and Jesus said that would be in the last days and here it is claiming some binary thing and my pronouns are are are they and them and I hope you jump through all the Hoops to try to keep from offending somebody on their pronouns but I want you to know I'm just too old I am not about to now start tiptoeing Through the Tulips to try to call somebody they and them and when we were buying a CH child's garment something for Elana and the little little uh thank you son the little clerk uses a plural pronoun to refer to a single child because she doesn't want to offend Us in case we're not one of those who choose to hang a gender on a baby when it's born have you lost your mind we happen to know it's a girl we check the we check the radar what do you call it we checked the ultrasound and we could see the plumbing and we know right now without a doubt that that's exactly what it's going to be a girl and she's going to be raised to be a girl and I I believe with all my heart she's going to be raised right and godly and whole and a and I don't think I don't know but from what I understand from the parents you're not going to see Brit's owner not even now because we wouldn't want her to grow up and look back and say how come it was all right that's how the message people do it these days but I want you to know in 1988 899 91 92 993 they didn't do it that way believe women in this message didn't wear pajamas then either and if they did if they did they certainly didn't tell it because they saw a little verse there they said whoa I'm about to lose my breath just a [Music] minute somebody get me some oxygen and an IV I'm going to preach on a minute CU some little godly woman some little Godly Man read a verse that said that even that which pertaineth somebody said well I don't buy mine in the men's department I I buy them in the women's Department that's not that's not what the scripture was talking about which department do you buy it in the scripture was talking about what pertains to you'd be shocked out of your socks if I if I if I brought me a skirt yeah I saw something in Target last night oh don't tell anybody I was in Target on a Saturday night ton night I saw something in Target last night looked like a dress in the men's department some kind of hood some kind of uh I'll get in a minute pullover thing that went way down to there didn't it didn't it went way down to there and had a zipper down it and kind of chamber or something kind of just popular Lo and they they and they'll sell it they will sell it right here in the Bible Belt they will sell it and some old twist and will buy it come on and dare you to say anything about it but I don't have to do it because they do that that certainly looked to me like it pertained to a woman and I didn't want no part of it and a sister who wants to follow the lord she's looking for those things that still matter somebody said that's Old Testament the problem with that is I told you Tuesday night is that little line that says to to blend to to confuse the genders it's an Abomination unto the Lord he said it that means it doesn't change what he if he hated that kind of thing then he hates it now come on it's a spirit of delusion it's a seducing spirit I know it's [Music] quiet now I I uh have just just a very few minutes left 1 John chapter 4 this was really the meat of what I wanted to say and I won't be able to say it today but I'll I'll pick this up Tuesday night 1 John 4 1-3 beloved believe not every Spirit somebody will say I feel it in my spirit that's not always something we can trust because there's doorways into this inner Inner Man and these things can affect us mind will and emotions can affect us come on and memories and imaginations and conscience and affections and reasonings they can affect us in the Inner Man so we can't believe every little unction or every little feeling or every little spirit that tries to move us but the Bible said try the spirits whether they are of God how will we be able to do that because we have an absolute word that's right somebody said but what about all those people preaching out of the same book preaching this lie or that lie or the other lie that's why you need the Holy Ghost you need to know that you know that you know that you've had more than a goosebump you've had more than a tear you've had More Than A Feeling because that Holy Spirit will lead you back to the word every time every time every time and God will put the truth in your path I'm telling you this is what is such a blessing to me when you think you've got a handle on it if God sees that you don't have it all he he sends the same Holy Spirit pulls that same Holy Spirit up out of your life and takes you a little deeper a little further in the truth God leads his dear children along many of us came through all kinds of denominational experiences to get to where we are today and if there was any possibility that more truth would come I'd like to follow that as well and a man who says they wouldn't there's something wrong with that man believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God now you may think that everybody believes that in christiandom but I want you to know they simply do not you can take John 1 and tell some body in the beginning was the word and the Word was made flesh and the Word was God and some people will walk away with two and three people but you can read that to a part of this little bride and when they begin to have their eyes Anointed with Isa it don't matter how many how many voices spoke out of heaven and how many doves flew by and how many prayers he uttered in the garden none of that really matters to them because all they can see is one God manifesting himself in many different ways we can't see nothing else somebody said I'd love to see the Trinity well I wish you could if you want to see it that bad but you're going to have to look at the church and not the book if you look at the word all of it every spirit that confesses not that Jesus has come in the flesh is not of God I'm nearly done but I don't have to stop it's not 2 o' yet we're into Sunday night now folks you don't even have to find some where to go to church tonight this is Sunday night right now we've done left Sunday morning and this is the spirit of antichrist listen and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world I just had a flashback of being with sister pericet a Nigerian a Spirit-filled nun friend of mine see I don't hate Catholics she was a friend of mine good friend and of Jonathan's we loved her she loved us she loved him I'm easier to love than Jonathan but she loved both of us and she helps us get into the church of of uh the Nativity in Bethlehem and we're walking through there with the nun folks we were just chopping in high cotton everybody was just just greeting us like we were representatives of the Vatican they thought we were visiting from Rome we passed the little cabinet where the Holy Eucharist is kept that's the way for God that's the round wafer God that they've prayed over and dedicated it and called it Jesus when sister pericle she bows and she starts signing the cross and I asked her what in word are you doing and she wants us to know in case we wanted to join her in in in in in stooping down to pay homage to the bread now I've been mighty hungry and I've been mighty thankful for bread before but not in the same context as she wanted us to be she said now if the priest has already blessed that she said that's not just bread that's God I said now sister that's where you and I are going to have to strongly disagree what I wanted to tell her in fact I did tell her later what you should have done was showed your respect to me and then let me show my respect I wasn't going to do that to her but let me show my respect to her because if you're filled with the life of God you're more than a hunk of Flesh you're also the spirit of the Living God walking around people want to pay respect they want want to worship something so bad that they make a chalice of wine blood and a piece of bread body when all they have to do is recognize that he wasn't looking for a piece of bread to live in or a chalice of wine he was looking for a house in you and I we are the temple that Spirit has already come he said and now is already in the world in closing I want to introduce the subject for Tuesday night we've covered that first two Spirits maybe not good but we've scratched the surface musicians are coming the seducing Spirit which often manifests itself telling a lie the problem with the LI there's always going to be a smattering of Truth there to make it believable is that right are you asleep number two a religious spirit that comes in waves of delusion sometime you know it's the same kind of devil that makes people think a woman think that because her hair is long and her skirt is long that she's right with God that's a delusion that's a religious spirit you can dress her up and put her on a dress and make her hair long and and she can be pale as a ghost and all those different things I believe in Holiness but that doesn't mean her uniform is not what identifies her as a real True Blood Bought spirit filled child of God if a if the length of a skirt made someone and I I do wish you sisters would make them longer instead of shorter but if that was the case then you you've got now this this year is going to be a trend again for long skirts you know and uh of course they're split all the way up to the crotch can I say that in the pull pit I just did but they're long if the length is what made someone a Christian then all youd have to do is go down there and buy you one of them it's not that's not it if talking in tongues is what made you a Christian then anybody could start making some rattling sounds on their tongue it's the life it's the life it's the life and then number three on Tuesday night I think you'll want to I really think you'll want to hear to be a part of this teaching starting Tuesday night we're going to start talking about the last of those three Spirits it's a familiar spirit and I think that if God says the bride's going to have to deal with familiar spirits in the last days I think we ought to know what we're coming up against it's not just a spirit of WI witchcraft because when we think of Witchcraft we think of witches and crystal balls and black cats and hats and and we think of darthy and and Toto and come on but it's much more than that the Bible tells us that we can be stubborn and rebellious not calling on demons not praying to the dead but he said you've got that kind of spirit on you that's witchcraft too a spirit of control where you're trying to control everyone around you that can also be a witchcraft Spirit manipulation and coercion and I'm going to make that so real to you over the next two Services if the Lord allows that you're going to recognize that sometimes those Spirits like to hang around us because we have remained underneath the curse of that generational iniquity but if we can re-identify ourselves this Blood Bought children of God and quit telling everybody that that Grandma had sugar diabetes so I guess I have to have it and mama was jealous so that's why I'm jealous come on if we start reidentifying ourselves as New Creations when you're born again of the spirit of God you have the ability to break free hey somebody said it runs in my family it runs in my family it runs in my family Pride runs in my family why don't you keep passing it on to your to your children then come on now stubbornness runs in my f why don't you just pass it on down then if not if you don't want that then why don't you raise up and say I am a new creation in Christ I'm no longer identified with gener ational iniquities curses diseases Tendencies addictions my old life is dead in Christ I'm living in the new life of Salvation bought with a price filled with the life of God I don't have to be what mama was or what Daddy was or grandma or Uncle Joe I can be what God created me to be until we come woo we got to go got to go until we come to our new identity in Christ we may find Spirits hanging around our lives that have become so familiar to us that we don't even recognize them as demonic we sometimes call them our way our nature that's who I am that's how I act you just have to take me or leave me if you can't accept me for who I am that's a that is a rotten sorry lie that the devil destroys marriages with you didn't get married to stay who you were if you liked who you were how preach brother if you liked who you were so much before you got married why didn't you stay single you don't get married to stay who you are that's just my way that's my mama's way that's my Grandmama's way I'm just like my daddy she didn't marry your daddy she married you and if you didn't hope to grow if you didn't hope to grow why do you want to drag somebody else into your dysfunction that's right why do you want to take some poor girl that don't know no better and drag her into your dysfunctioning mess you wanted to grow you you wanted to form a new family you don't have to be under the family you came from this is this don't mean you mistreat your loved ones you you don't you don't stay away from them cuz I don't want to be like them that's not how you deal with that stuff you deal with it in the altar you deal with it in in your devotional life you deal with it in prayer you apply the word you command that familiar Spirit to get out of your life and quit trying to make your marriage as dysfunctional as your parents was well I just don't know how to treat a woman my daddy didn't know how to treat a woman my Grandmama didn't know how come on so what happens is demons hear these kinds of confessions and they draw near Believers I showed you in the message I showed you the difference between possession and oppression as long as they're on the outside that's one thing if they're on the inside that's possession and that's another level of Deliverance required to get you free but as long as you're just feeding them pie you can just save the pie and send them on their way look folks as long as you entertain a devil it'll hang out and drink your Kool-Aid but when you put it on its way so commit yourself therefore unto God resist the devil and he will the reason why they don't flee is because we welcome them we have become so even as Believers we have become so familiar with these Spirits that's right that we think it's just our personality it's just our nature you know I got my granny's temper give it back to Granny brother if she's no longer alive drive over there to the funeral home roll your window down I mean to the cemetery and drive your driver right up there next to her grave roll your window down and say you dirty devil get out of my car you're not going to ride another Mile with me I'm taking you back to my dear old granny you're looking at me like I've lost my mind do what

program where you keep calling yourself what you were that's if that's helpful for somebody to go go right ahead but once you're truly born again for you to keep calling yourself as an as an addict a

falls apart when it rains it pulls you're quiet I'm almost just quoting some things I've heard as a pastor you get it in your mind I've seen more sorrow lately than I've ever seen I can hardly make it I can hardly get up folks that is not who you are that's what's happened in your life I'm not trying to diminish it every family in this church has known pain and loss every family in this church has known sorrow and heartache and problems and troubles and job squeezes and so forth but it's not who we are hello you don't need somebody else to feel sorry for you to validate what you feel what you need is to sing this song to the top of your lungs and let every devil in hell hear you singing it's his goodness in the midst of my Horror in the midst of my sorrow in the midst of my loss in the midst of watching my my investment shrink come on now brother it's his goodness that got me up this morning it's his faithfulness I'm alive I may have aches and pains but I'm alive I remind myself

understand you can always encourage yourself the Bible tells us to we're mostly waiting on somebody else to encourage us but the Bible tells us we can encourage ourselves we can pray in the Holy Ghost I think that's why the devil doesn't want message people praying in tongues right is because he knows there's power when you start praying in another language it's bypassing hell it's bypassing the imps it's going straight into the will right up into the presence of God when we know not how to pray as we ought he makes intercession for us come on now you have the ability to rise and I'm telling you the later the hour the more important it becomes sir for us not to wallow anymore well that's easy for you to say you've already told us that you've got most of your monthly bills paid already and
