[37:46] and uh we have another uh very happy
[37:51] announcement to make today

[38:04] you don't usually hear
[38:07] silence in a Pentecostal Church like
[38:09] that
[38:10] everybody's wondering if I'm going to be
[38:12] a granddaddy or something it's coming
[38:16] but not yet
[38:19] I won't uh I want Jennifer and Josiah to
[38:22] stand up

[38:35] [Applause]
[38:43] smiles
[38:47] God bless you both
[38:48] [Applause]
[38:51] so
[38:52] you'll be hearing Wedding Bells
[39:01] sometime in the next 10 years
[39:07] ain't
[39:08] no no no no no no we cancel that we
[39:12] cancel that in the name of Jesus
[39:14] sometime in 2023 is that better
[39:18] is that better huh much better
[39:24] well I can just go ahead and give them
[39:25] the date you all are thinking about if
[39:27] you want me to but I was trying to be
[39:28] discreet
[39:31] oh God's good all over this house
[39:34] amen
[39:36] um I am I am extremely embarrassed to
[39:40] tell you uh that your uh little token
[39:44] gift that we give to all of the fathers
[39:46] is leaving Montgomery Alabama about now
[39:52] and will not make it for the service
[39:54] today
[39:57] uh Joshua will you go to my office and
[40:00] get that big uh bear that big bin of
[40:03] pins
[40:04] and put them in the vestibule and I I
[40:08] just didn't want you to leave here
[40:10] empty-handed your present is coming it's
[40:13] a long story we don't want to use the
[40:15] Lord's time to tell it uh but basically
[40:19] websites will continue to sell things
[40:21] they know they don't have in stock
[40:23] because they want your money
[40:26] and so I've been on the phone with them
[40:29] multiple times this week they promised
[40:32] me uh with a swear that it would be here
[40:36] on Friday and it is it they did not come
[40:39] therefore I'm not going to preach a
[40:41] Father's Day message today because my
[40:45] Father's Day message went with the gift
[40:50] I'm going to preach don't you worry
[40:54] but not a Father's Day message I'm going
[40:56] to save it because the sermon is called
[40:59] the measure of a Godly Man and I want to
[41:01] I want to give that to you when I return
[41:04] from Tucson we will do that but I would
[41:06] like to honor the special fathers
[41:08] they're all special
[41:10] I want you to know that dads are very
[41:13] underappreciated in today's society
[41:17] there are some great Statesmen who said
[41:20] that a father has the harder job
[41:24] I will leave that for history to decide
[41:28] but I will say that if a man is going to
[41:30] be a godly man and a Godly father
[41:33] to be able to provide for his children
[41:36] and still be present in their life
[41:40] is a very very difficult uh task
[41:43] for mothers who work at a home uh where
[41:47] we believe God has called them to work a
[41:50] first and foremost they get to be with
[41:53] their children every day because we
[41:55] don't send our children down to Egypt to
[41:57] be schooled
[41:58] we School our kids at home and so the
[42:01] mother has more of an opportunity and
[42:04] that's why I always tell mothers please
[42:06] don't save the discipline for when dad
[42:10] comes home
[42:13] can I get a little help here
[42:15] you grow a backbone
[42:20] and you do the discipline as well use
[42:24] dad as a as as a last resort
[42:29] so that
[42:31] he is not always seen
[42:34] as the one who does the swatting
[42:39] you're with them all day long
[42:41] and if you can't if a situation arises
[42:45] and believe me it will
[42:47] that you can't quite handle then dad
[42:49] comes in and he has been nurturing them
[42:52] already when he comes home
[42:54] and and he can step into that role of
[42:57] disciplinarian and he can also let them
[43:00] know that they're covered so a godly man
[43:02] who's away from the home who who uh has
[43:07] to come home provide oftentimes the
[43:09] discipline and to be present with his
[43:13] children it's huge it's a huge
[43:15] responsibility and Hollywood has made
[43:19] all Dads look dumb
[43:23] and we are not dumb
[43:26] we are very very intelligent beings
[43:29] creatures come on dads
[43:31] and so we are not all you know I I don't
[43:35] know very much about
[43:37] some of the popular television shows but
[43:42] uh I've heard of the cartoon called The
[43:45] Simpsons
[43:46] I've never watched an episode but I've
[43:49] seen a few clips and I know that he is
[43:52] often used as the poster boy of dumb
[43:55] fathers
[43:57] and what a shame
[43:59] why why don't if you if you we don't
[44:01] want to model after Hollywood but you
[44:03] know there was a time when when there
[44:05] were programs like Father Knows Best
[44:08] and my three sons does anybody remember
[44:11] those and dads were made to be or or
[44:14] Beaver beaver's dad
[44:19] here's a church that doesn't believe in
[44:20] television talking about all the old
[44:22] programs
[44:23] well if we could have if we could have
[44:25] it like it was then it would be a little
[44:27] bit of a these these men were made to
[44:29] look like they had some sense
[44:31] and they were present they were present
[44:34] and so I want to honor you men of God
[44:36] you you do not have an easy task I want
[44:40] to specially salute you that have
[44:42] Blended families
[44:43] because when you have a blended family
[44:45] you are taking on a responsibility that
[44:48] was not initially yours and it's a huge
[44:51] responsibility when children and they
[44:55] should never be sorted this way but when
[44:58] they end up being sorted Yours Mine and
[45:01] Ours
[45:04] it's a very difficult path to walk
[45:07] that's why you young men need to make
[45:10] sure and you young sisters need to make
[45:13] sure that when you when you uh are
[45:15] engaged when you ask someone to marry
[45:18] you that it's someone that you can live
[45:19] with for the rest of your life you get
[45:22] one child one chance
[45:24] you'll get one chance
[45:26] you better stick with that you better
[45:28] know her in out up and down
[45:31] and she better know you that way
[45:34] there's not going to be great Revival to
[45:36] follow you need to you need to become
[45:38] engaged in great Revival when you're
[45:41] both filled to capacity with the Holy
[45:43] Ghost
[45:44] and then you won't ever have to do my
[45:47] kids your kids and our kids
[45:49] and you will have a much easier you men
[45:51] will have a much easier task if you wait
[45:54] for the one that God has for you
[45:57] I was I was nearly what 30 years old and
[46:01] before I married and uh it felt a little
[46:04] old I know some of you are single and
[46:06] older than that but it felt a little bit
[46:08] old at the time but but God knows that
[46:11] if you if you marry too early and get
[46:15] the wrong one or if you're married too
[46:17] late and get the wrong one
[46:20] it's hell
[46:23] it's just hell let's just be honest
[46:26] and well I thought it was Father's Day
[46:28] that's right I want to help the next
[46:30] generation of fathers
[46:32] it's not easy a man that won't provide
[46:35] for his own family is worse than an
[46:37] Infidel he's denied the faith
[46:39] and so you better make sure that if
[46:42] you're one of those who believes that
[46:43] your quiver needs to be full
[46:46] the Bible didn't say that every man's
[46:48] quiver needed to be full it said blessed
[46:50] is the man
[46:51] he has a blessing from the Lord but he
[46:54] didn't say that every man's quiver has
[46:56] to be filled to capacity and running
[46:58] over
[47:01] you're going to help me
[47:04] but blessed is but but you you want to
[47:07] know that when you bring them here you
[47:09] can provide emotionally for them and
[47:11] spiritually
[47:13] for a long time
[47:16] maybe even after they're married you
[47:18] still provide something don't you
[47:21] so anyway we are blessed in this body
[47:24] because we have incredible dads here
[47:27] incredible men of God and Men of
[47:29] Integrity and I will celebrate you with
[47:32] a message when we return from Tucson
[47:35] but I want to just quickly honor the uh
[47:38] what we call those the special
[47:40] categories of fathers I want to honor
[47:43] the oldest father who is here in the
[47:46] room
[47:48] uh
[47:52] who said that
[47:54] who said that David said that
[48:01] [Music]
[48:02] take off my shoe
[48:05] you know you were going to be one of the
[48:07] youngest fathers

[49:00] oldest father and be 64. so many of our
[49:03] older dads have gone to be with the Lord

[54:37] Abigail's gets to be with us would you
[54:39] see that brother Shane gets home
[54:50] this one is for brother Greeley
[54:57] I think most of you know that sister
[55:01] green slipped away from us this week
[55:05] at uh 88 years old
[55:08] she would be 89 in November
[55:13] she has been a precious friend to me for
[55:16] over 30 years
[55:18] and uh one of the best friends that my
[55:21] wife has ever had
[55:24] there were quite a few years of
[55:27] difference in their age
[55:29] but they clicked immediately
[55:33] and we have never left sister green
[55:35] through these years
[55:37] I think I think they met in about 20
[55:41] 12 or something like that
[55:44] uh we never left her but but my wife
[55:48] cried and she's not an easy crier
[55:51] but sister green meant so much to us we
[55:54] had hours of of close
[55:57] or conversations with her that we
[56:00] cherish
[56:02] she was in Tucson for over 50 years they
[56:06] were in Beaumont Texas before that and
[56:09] she was in Tucson for over 50 years as a
[56:11] pastor's wife
[56:13] and Stacy and I would drive her around
[56:15] the town and she would say right over
[56:18] there we had a meeting with brother
[56:20] Branham
[56:21] and would tell us the Miracles she saw
[56:24] and the people that she met
[56:27] I remember her telling us one day that
[56:29] brother Branham was standing in the back
[56:31] of the auditorium or uh I think it was
[56:33] the German Center or some some kind of
[56:35] public
[56:37] hall the service was over and and
[56:40] normally he would have been taken out
[56:42] after having prayed for the sick but for
[56:44] some reason he was standing there at the
[56:45] door with them
[56:46] and he reached up and took a hold of
[56:48] Janet's hair
[56:50] their middle daughter
[56:52] and said don't ever cut that
[56:55] and that memory was so vivid
[56:59] in Sister Green's mind as we would go
[57:01] over that City
[57:03] she would tell us the great things that
[57:06] she had seen God do so our hearts are
[57:08] hurting only for us
[57:11] we're not hurting for her at all she is
[57:15] in the presence of the Lord and has
[57:17] started receiving a well deserved reward
[57:22] but we would desire your prayers for us
[57:26] she asked me uh close to seven years ago
[57:30] would I have her funeral service and
[57:33] then the next thing she said really
[57:35] shocked me
[57:36] she said I want you to send me off
[57:40] in a good way a grand way
[57:45] and she was a back behind the scenes
[57:48] kind of person
[57:50] but she said I cherish every word you
[57:53] spoke over Perry
[57:55] and she said I just hope that you can
[57:57] find something to say about me when I'm
[58:00] gone
[58:01] and I considered a great honor to do it
[58:04] but a but a heavy responsibility so I
[58:06] would desire your prayers
[58:08] there has not been a lot of time to
[58:10] prepare uh we only found out Friday that
[58:13] the service would be Tuesday
[58:15] and not wanting to miss the weekend
[58:17] we're not leaving until 7 30 in the
[58:19] morning with nothing packed so we need
[58:22] your prayers brother Greeley has
[58:25] graciously allowed me to stay through
[58:27] the weekend and I've already booked
[58:29] places to preach next Sunday
[58:31] and uh but I will have a few days uh in
[58:35] the city that I love very much and be
[58:37] back with you on Monday would you pray
[58:39] for the Green family all three daughters
[58:42] many many grandchildren many
[58:45] great-grandchildren and many of them
[58:47] away from the Lord
[58:49] that God would just send a wave of his
[58:53] convicting Spirit to touch that family
[58:56] and sweep them back into the kingdom of
[58:58] God for such a time as this
[59:02] and we would appreciate those prayers
[59:04] very much would you stand
[59:07] I know the hours late
[59:13] I want you to sing this chorus with me
[59:15] in in honor of Sister Green we were
[59:17] blessed
[59:18] to have her here
[59:21] she sang behind this pulpit and blessed
[59:24] us so much
[59:26] she came to visit our church the first
[59:28] time way back in about 1992.
[59:33] and she was a spry back then and still
[59:37] young and
[59:39] of the life of of everything that we did
[59:44] I have a picture I took him to Atlanta
[59:47] and showed them underground Atlanta and
[59:49] some of the sites up there and Richard
[59:51] and Tina were hearing the kids and
[59:54] and I have a picture of Sister Green
[59:57] hanging on you know the cat was the
[1:00:00] cat's name Sylvester is that the one
[1:00:02] that was after Tweety Bird or something
[1:00:04] like that they had a big old display of
[1:00:06] that and then before I could stop her
[1:00:08] sister green had jumped up and grabbed a
[1:00:09] hold of Sylvester's tail and was
[1:00:11] swinging on it and I grabbed a picture
[1:00:15] she was the life of the party all the
[1:00:17] way through and she could make me laugh
[1:00:20] like no other Benjamin said this week he
[1:00:24] said I'm going to miss I'm going to miss
[1:00:26] the way she threw back her head and
[1:00:28] clapped with her fingers all spread out
[1:00:30] and laughed every time she really found
[1:00:32] something funny she would she would
[1:00:34] laugh like that she's really laughing

[1:04:20] [Applause]
[1:04:21] turned to first Thessalonians chapter 4.
[1:04:29] verse 15 through 17.
[1:04:35] God bless all of you who are streaming
[1:04:38] this service
[1:04:41] I'm glancing down and I'm seeing
[1:04:44] multiple Nations represented God bless
[1:04:47] you
[1:04:48] some are watching it on YouTube some are
[1:04:51] watching it on the website some are
[1:04:54] watching and on Facebook some are
[1:04:56] watching it on the app
[1:04:58] we can't see all of you your names at
[1:05:01] one time but we thank God that you have
[1:05:04] joined us today and
[1:05:06] we again wish every father here and
[1:05:09] there a Happy Father's Day
[1:05:12] for this we say unto you
[1:05:15] by the word of the Lord that we which
[1:05:18] are alive and remain unto the coming of
[1:05:21] the Lord
[1:05:22] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[1:05:27] for the Lord himself
[1:05:30] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:05:34] somebody say number one
[1:05:36] with the voice of the Archangel that's
[1:05:39] number two
[1:05:41] and with the Trump of God that's number
[1:05:45] three and the result I want you to catch
[1:05:49] this and the result of number one two
[1:05:51] and three
[1:05:54] it's not just the result of number three
[1:05:57] the Trump of God
[1:05:58] it is the result of all three phases of
[1:06:02] the rapture
[1:06:03] that causes the dead in Christ to rise
[1:06:08] first
[1:06:09] so there must be a shout
[1:06:11] and there must be the voice of the
[1:06:13] archangel
[1:06:15] and there must be the last Trump of God
[1:06:17] and when all of these three things have
[1:06:21] had their fulfillment
[1:06:23] then we know that the dead in Christ
[1:06:25] shall get up out of their graves
[1:06:28] somebody said you don't really believe
[1:06:30] that we do
[1:06:32] you don't think that's literal that we
[1:06:34] do
[1:06:35] we literally believe
[1:06:38] now we don't believe that the church at
[1:06:42] large is going in the rapture
[1:06:44] just because you have your name on a
[1:06:46] church or old somewhere doesn't make you
[1:06:48] Rapture Ready it's whether or not you've
[1:06:51] really been born again of the spirit of
[1:06:53] Jesus Christ and a part of his elected
[1:06:56] and predestinated bride
[1:06:58] they are not appointed unto Wrath
[1:07:01] the church itself will go into the last
[1:07:03] three and a half years of Great
[1:07:05] Tribulation and will have her robes
[1:07:09] washed
[1:07:12] she would not be able to stand before
[1:07:15] him with the with the spotted garments
[1:07:18] of denominationalism
[1:07:20] you help me preach a little bit
[1:07:23] she must have them clean the blood of
[1:07:26] Jesus has has certainly been applied to
[1:07:29] her heart if she called on the Lord the
[1:07:32] Bible said whosoever shall call upon the
[1:07:34] name of the Lord shall be saved but if
[1:07:37] she kept her ties in that old
[1:07:39] denominational system of the world where
[1:07:43] things are blurry and gray and there's
[1:07:45] no black or white then she's got some
[1:07:48] bud mud she's got some some stuff on her
[1:07:52] garment and she must also be purified
[1:07:56] and will do so by her suffering
[1:07:59] but she will also come up
[1:08:02] and stand before the the bema Judgment
[1:08:05] seat of the Lord
[1:08:07] the little bride will not be judged
[1:08:10] before that judgment seat she is being
[1:08:13] judged sifted tested tempted tried
[1:08:16] purified Sanctified now
[1:08:20] and therefore she is chosen to according
[1:08:24] to Revelation to sit down with him
[1:08:27] in his father's Throne judge the nations
[1:08:31] of the world and the angels that have
[1:08:34] fallen
[1:08:36] that's the word
[1:08:38] amen let's do verse is that verse 17 and
[1:08:41] we will have our seeds then we which are
[1:08:45] alive and remain I'd like to be a part
[1:08:47] of that crowd
[1:08:49] I would I'd like to be one of those
[1:08:51] that's alive on Rapture morning
[1:08:56] maybe wake up that morning uh with a
[1:08:58] little little acre pain
[1:09:00] and all of a sudden
[1:09:02] realize this is the day
[1:09:05] I used to hear Sister Green sing the
[1:09:08] song This Could Be the dawning
[1:09:11] of that great Eternal morning
[1:09:15] one of these days it's going to be a
[1:09:17] reality and we which are alive and
[1:09:19] remain shall be caught up together with
[1:09:21] them
[1:09:23] in the clouds
[1:09:27] to meet the Lord in the air
[1:09:31] let's read the last phrase together
[1:09:34] and so shall we ever be with the Lord
[1:09:37] God bless that reading of his word you
[1:09:40] may be seated
[1:09:43] I would like to read a quotation to you
[1:09:46] this morning that I shared with you last
[1:09:49] Sunday if that's permitted
[1:09:51] it's from the Rapture message Yuma
[1:09:54] Arizona paragraph 152 through 155.
[1:10:00] brother Branham is
[1:10:02] reminding us
[1:10:05] of the order of the Resurrection
[1:10:09] I like to call it the three phases of
[1:10:12] the rapture
[1:10:13] he says now it's the first thing is the
[1:10:17] sounding and and he gets a little tongue
[1:10:19] twisted there finally puts it in order
[1:10:22] by saying in the highlighted sentence
[1:10:24] Shout
[1:10:26] a messenger getting the people ready
[1:10:31] now I want you to know After the Dark
[1:10:33] Ages there was a lot of truth that had
[1:10:37] been lost
[1:10:38] did you know there were centuries that
[1:10:41] no one believed in Divine Healing
[1:10:45] can you imagine going to church every
[1:10:47] week and not even believing that God is
[1:10:50] Is A Healer
[1:10:51] that he's able to heal you and for
[1:10:55] Generations they didn't believe you
[1:10:56] could know that you're saved when the
[1:11:00] scripture is clear they shall know
[1:11:02] they're saved
[1:11:04] by the quickening
[1:11:07] by by the coming alive by the
[1:11:10] resurrection of their Spirit they will
[1:11:13] know you know in your nowhere is that
[1:11:16] all right to say you will know in your
[1:11:18] knower that you're saved and then he
[1:11:22] beautifies the meek
[1:11:27] he makes the meek he beautifies the meek
[1:11:30] with salvation
[1:11:32] not Revlon
[1:11:36] not Max Factor
[1:11:39] come on now
[1:11:40] not Clinique
[1:11:43] not paint and powder hello
[1:11:46] let's preach Holiness this morning
[1:11:49] he beautifies the meek with
[1:11:52] salvation
[1:11:54] and the word salvation is Yeshua
[1:11:58] say it with me Yeshua and that's the
[1:12:00] Hebrew name of the Lord Jesus Christ so
[1:12:03] the scripture is really say he would
[1:12:05] beautify the meek with himself
[1:12:08] it's Jesus that shines out of your
[1:12:11] countenance it's Jesus that makes you
[1:12:14] light it's Jesus that causes you to be
[1:12:17] bright and the direct results of having
[1:12:20] received his light is you receive love
[1:12:24] and you don't only receive love you're
[1:12:26] not just a taker of love you're a giver
[1:12:29] of love and by this shall all men know
[1:12:32] that you are my disciples
[1:12:35] by this shall all men know that you have
[1:12:37] passed from Death unto life
[1:12:40] that you will have love one for another
[1:12:46] we've got to have
[1:12:50] we've got to have that kind of love it's
[1:12:53] in US you can't be saved and not have
[1:12:56] that kind of love Jesus brings it when
[1:12:58] he moves in
[1:12:59] but it's the giving
[1:13:01] you might remember the story of how a
[1:13:04] friend of ours
[1:13:05] had an experience with this whole
[1:13:08] scenario of did you learn to love
[1:13:12] can you imagine standing waiting to be
[1:13:15] escorted into the presence of God in
[1:13:18] eternity and having the question asked
[1:13:21] not did you dress right
[1:13:25] not did you believe right not did you go
[1:13:28] to the right church but can you imagine
[1:13:31] being asked did you learn to love
[1:13:33] someone answered and said Lord I loved
[1:13:36] you
[1:13:41] but I never learned to love your people
[1:13:45] now how many of you know there's
[1:13:47] something wrong
[1:13:49] I happen to believe that that experience
[1:13:51] was real and I happen to believe that it
[1:13:54] stands as a stark reminder to us today
[1:13:58] that we can get all the doctrines right
[1:14:02] we can know exactly where to send
[1:14:05] somebody in the tape
[1:14:07] but until we can learn to love an
[1:14:09] unconditional love a love that's not
[1:14:12] based on someone's treatment toward you
[1:14:16] the Bible doesn't teach us to treat
[1:14:18] others as as they deserve to be treated
[1:14:21] or love others only if they deserve to
[1:14:25] be loved
[1:14:26] but it tells us that we should do unto
[1:14:29] others as we would have them to do unto
[1:14:31] us not as they do
[1:14:34] so we're doing right and we're doing
[1:14:36] good and we're expressing love even if
[1:14:40] it hurts
[1:14:41] how many of you know Love Hurts
[1:14:44] love is costly
[1:14:46] in all kinds of relationships in
[1:14:49] Parental relationship and love a spousal
[1:14:53] and and courtship and it's painful love
[1:14:57] is painful but let me tell you don't let
[1:14:59] the enemy talk you out of the concept
[1:15:02] it's worth it it's worth it the gift to
[1:15:05] be able to love someone the gift to be
[1:15:07] able to receive love from someone is
[1:15:10] priceless
[1:15:12] and nobody should be loving like the
[1:15:15] Bride of Jesus Christ we should have the
[1:15:18] greatest measure of love one toward the
[1:15:20] other if you believe that same man
[1:15:23] I I'm being then let's go do it
[1:15:26] let's go out in this world and love one
[1:15:28] another
[1:15:29] loving one another is not accepting
[1:15:32] immorality it's not accepting perversion
[1:15:36] it's kindly a powerfully standing
[1:15:39] against the current of society but doing
[1:15:42] it with another self-righteous religious
[1:15:45] demeanor
[1:15:47] but honey I love you so much I don't
[1:15:50] want to see you lost and so I'm not
[1:15:52] standing in opposition of you but I'm
[1:15:54] standing in opposition of sin
[1:15:58] because if it's against the word I'm
[1:16:00] telling you you cannot be given eternal
[1:16:03] life when you're living a lifestyle that
[1:16:06] is against the word of God you cannot
[1:16:09] have eternal life and not live by the
[1:16:11] word
[1:16:14] let's read on now
[1:16:17] the second the shout is the first
[1:16:21] the second is the voice of the
[1:16:23] Resurrection the same voice
[1:16:25] a loud voice in Saint John 11 38 through
[1:16:28] 44 that called Lazarus from the grave I
[1:16:32] know that voice
[1:16:34] how many of you know we know that voice
[1:16:36] we are not strangers to him we are sheep
[1:16:40] of his pasture we know the shepherd's
[1:16:42] voice you don't have to be all that
[1:16:45] extra spiritual to begin to to discern
[1:16:48] the voice of the Lord in your own life
[1:16:50] it never
[1:16:52] contradicts the word it always goes I've
[1:16:55] had so many people come and tell me the
[1:16:57] Lord told me the Lord told me the Lord
[1:16:59] told me then what do we do we look at
[1:17:01] the word
[1:17:02] if you feel like the Lord is telling you
[1:17:05] something that is contrary to his word
[1:17:07] you're wrong
[1:17:10] if I think he's telling me something
[1:17:12] that doesn't line up with the written
[1:17:14] word I'm wrong
[1:17:17] and that has to be corrected
[1:17:19] amen because the word doesn't adapt to
[1:17:22] us
[1:17:24] anybody here we adapt we must adapt
[1:17:28] ourselves to the word
[1:17:30] he goes on getting the bride together
[1:17:32] and then the resurrection of the Dead
[1:17:34] see to be caught up with it now watch
[1:17:37] the three things take place the next is
[1:17:41] what a trumpet a shout a voice a trumpet
[1:17:48] now the third thing is the trumpet which
[1:17:51] always at the Feast of trumpets is
[1:17:53] calling the people to the feast and
[1:17:56] that'll be oh that's why I read it again
[1:18:01] and that'll be the
[1:18:03] how many of you are getting ready for
[1:18:05] the bride's supper
[1:18:07] oh not Jennifer's
[1:18:10] although I'm ready for that too
[1:18:13] I'm talking about the bride of Christ
[1:18:17] that great marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:18:22] and brother Branham tells us where that
[1:18:24] takes place in the sky
[1:18:26] he didn't say in this reference in
[1:18:29] heaven
[1:18:33] there's more to the sky there are more
[1:18:36] Dimensions between here and there is
[1:18:39] that right
[1:18:40] remember he tells us our loved ones are
[1:18:42] in a faster Dimension than the one that
[1:18:44] we're in right now
[1:18:46] and We Know by that that there's got to
[1:18:48] be something happen to pull us into them
[1:18:51] pull them into us and we're changed
[1:18:54] brother it's it's around the corner can
[1:18:57] we live circumspectly now can we live
[1:19:00] sold out to God I'm talking to you can
[1:19:02] we live sold out to God now can we get
[1:19:05] this compromise out of the way
[1:19:08] can we just strip ourselves of the world
[1:19:11] right now
[1:19:15] can we just be satisfied with what God's
[1:19:18] word has given us and how it is that
[1:19:21] we're to Adorn and make ourselves
[1:19:22] beautiful salvation and get rid of some
[1:19:25] of this worldly business that the little
[1:19:27] bride is seemingly picking up in the
[1:19:29] last day we don't need it
[1:19:32] we shouldn't want it
[1:19:35] we're going to the bride's supper
[1:19:39] hallelujah we're going to Feast with the
[1:19:42] lamb
[1:19:43] that should be enough for us the first
[1:19:46] thing comes forth is the message
[1:19:49] calling the bride together that's the
[1:19:51] shout the next thing is the resurrection
[1:19:53] of the sleeping bride the ones died back
[1:19:55] in the other ages they're caught
[1:19:57] together and the trumpet the feast in in
[1:20:00] the heavens is in the sky why that's the
[1:20:03] thing that takes place friends
[1:20:06] and he goes on we're right here ready
[1:20:09] now we're right there excuse me ready
[1:20:12] now the only thing the church coming out
[1:20:15] has got to lay before the s-o-n to ripen
[1:20:21] now you've got to be seed
[1:20:24] [Music]
[1:20:26] you've got to have the certified seed
[1:20:29] you can't have weed seed
[1:20:32] you can't have tear seed because if you
[1:20:36] are a tear seed you lay in the presence
[1:20:39] of the son and you just produce a tear
[1:20:42] life t-a-r-e
[1:20:44] or a weed
[1:20:46] I didn't necessarily mean marijuana
[1:20:50] I meant those ridiculous weeds that
[1:20:53] every Gardener has to deal with
[1:20:55] they multiply and try to choke out the
[1:20:58] life of what you are trying to cultivate
[1:21:00] but if you are the certified seed
[1:21:04] meaning you were with him in the
[1:21:06] beginning in his mind he knew you he
[1:21:09] foreknew you
[1:21:11] elected you predestinated you then when
[1:21:15] you get in the presence of the s-o-n
[1:21:19] which is what we were doing this morning
[1:21:24] may I say to the little brother who
[1:21:27] wrote on one of the reels or one of the
[1:21:30] posts may I say to you that the local
[1:21:35] church is sovereign
[1:21:38] and we set the order for this house
[1:21:45] so you who said something about what is
[1:21:48] this jumping up and down all things are
[1:21:50] to be decent and in order it is Acts
[1:21:53] chapter 2 not in your Bible
[1:21:56] have you not read that their behavior
[1:21:59] was such that they were accused of being
[1:22:01] drunk
[1:22:03] how long has it been since someone
[1:22:05] accused someone coming out of your
[1:22:07] church of being drunk
[1:22:09] I'm not trying to be critical I'm not
[1:22:12] even offended
[1:22:14] I just simply really wanted to respond
[1:22:16] I'm not Church of Christ
[1:22:20] we've had years of sitting still
[1:22:25] we've had years of folding our hands and
[1:22:27] trying to play the game
[1:22:30] and then all of a sudden you realize I
[1:22:33] don't have to be churchy
[1:22:34] [Applause]
[1:22:37] [Music]
[1:22:39] I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:41] and and and
[1:22:46] do I need to get some of you Brothers to

[1:23:27] can you please come and help me
[1:23:31] while you're smelling your flesh
[1:23:34] no nobody nobody comes in contact with
[1:23:37] f-i-r-e fire
[1:23:41] and wants to be religious or stiff or
[1:23:44] starchy when you have made contact with
[1:23:47] a genuine fire that fell on the day of
[1:23:51] Pentecost there's oh yes
[1:23:54] [Applause]
[1:23:56] there's going to be
[1:23:59] there's going to be some kind
[1:24:03] yours may not look like mine
[1:24:08] I know some of you can't dance like I
[1:24:10] can
[1:24:15] [Applause]
[1:24:17] you're looking at somebody that never
[1:24:19] danced for the world
[1:24:22] the only dancing I've ever done
[1:24:24] was in the house of God and I'm not
[1:24:27] ashamed of it
[1:24:29] and did you write that you were singing
[1:24:31] this morning did you you didn't write
[1:24:33] that well somebody wrote it for you
[1:24:38] ask them for your part of the royalty
[1:24:42] they wrote that with you in mind
[1:24:44] I happen to know part of the kind of
[1:24:46] week you've had this week
[1:24:50] brother Greeley talked about him being
[1:24:52] having already sweaty shirt because he's
[1:24:55] already been using his energies to
[1:24:58] Worship the Lord
[1:25:00] Benjamin Was preparing he was prepared
[1:25:03] to sweat he borrowed my sweat rag
[1:25:06] before he ever come out here he said can
[1:25:08] you got an extra sweat rag I can have I
[1:25:10] said just brought that one back clean
[1:25:12] you can have it
[1:25:13] they're getting ready
[1:25:15] and when I saw it when I heard those
[1:25:17] words coming out of brother Josh I knew
[1:25:19] it had been a particularly hard week
[1:25:22] and and I was so touched
[1:25:26] by the fact that he was singing his own
[1:25:29] story
[1:25:30] this is why I clapped my hands this is
[1:25:33] why I praise the Lord not because
[1:25:35] everything's going well not because I
[1:25:38] have no problem no worry no concern no
[1:25:40] trouble no burden but because I've
[1:25:43] learned that in every situation God
[1:25:46] in every trial God is good no whoa no
[1:25:52] matter how black it gets God is good
[1:25:55] even in the confusion God is good
[1:25:58] [Applause]
[1:25:59] [Music]
[1:26:02] that's the kind of look that's the kind
[1:26:04] of prison I want
[1:26:05] I want to be around that
[1:26:08] I want to be around that I have said
[1:26:10] before that sometimes people look around
[1:26:12] the church and say oh these people raise
[1:26:14] and we got quite a few missing this
[1:26:16] morning but they look around this room
[1:26:18] and they say oh these people are all
[1:26:19] raised in church and had a spiritual
[1:26:22] silver spoon in their mouth and my
[1:26:24] they've never knew sin and
[1:26:27] I like to tell every now and again you
[1:26:29] don't understand you're sitting in a
[1:26:30] building this morning with former drug
[1:26:32] addicts and harlots and
[1:26:35] [Applause]
[1:26:37] they're not just dope smokers former
[1:26:39] dope smokers here but heroin addicts and
[1:26:42] those who played around with cocaine and
[1:26:44] we could go on in alternative lives with
[1:26:46] all kinds of junk
[1:26:49] we're here by the blood of the Lamb
[1:26:52] we're Overcoming By The Blood and by the
[1:26:56] word of our own prophetic testimony and
[1:26:59] if God did it for us this is why we act
[1:27:01] the way we do if God did it for us
[1:27:06] he can do it for anybody who has a
[1:27:09] willing heart
[1:27:15] to get me stirred
[1:27:18] go ahead and praise the Lord
[1:27:20] it's worthy
[1:27:23] [Applause]
[1:27:27] Hallelujah
[1:27:29] Hallelujah
[1:27:31] Hallelujah
[1:27:34] Hallelujah bonjour my uh blessed brother
[1:27:38] living in France
[1:27:40] from the hills of North Carolina
[1:27:42] streaming the service now
[1:27:44] from from France God bless you
[1:27:47] now
[1:27:48] we've got so much to look forward to in
[1:27:51] this
[1:27:52] we are laying before the son to ripen
[1:27:54] you're gonna you're gonna produce you're
[1:27:57] gonna manifest what you are who you are
[1:27:59] that's what's coming out and one day the
[1:28:02] great combine is going to come by after
[1:28:05] a while and and the stalks of the wheat
[1:28:08] I'm I'm reading 155 are in paraphrasing
[1:28:12] in paragraph 155 and and the stalks of
[1:28:15] the wheat are going to be burned
[1:28:19] but the grain
[1:28:24] you see the seed has a carrier
[1:28:27] you're not you're not saving the stock
[1:28:31] you're saving the multiplied seed
[1:28:34] a multiplication of the original seed
[1:28:37] that went in the ground that's what the
[1:28:39] Harvest looks like
[1:28:41] if there should be a harvest in the end
[1:28:44] time it'll have to look like the
[1:28:45] Original Seed
[1:28:49] which is Christ
[1:28:51] if there's going to be a bride's Harvest
[1:28:53] if there's going to be a harvest around
[1:28:56] them third pool Ministry of the Bride
[1:28:58] then it's going to have to look like the
[1:29:01] Original Seed
[1:29:03] and that's why God sent a prophet who
[1:29:06] could pay the price make the right
[1:29:08] choices not perfect born in sin shaping
[1:29:13] an iniquity he was not infallible
[1:29:17] every word that come out of his mouth
[1:29:19] was not the saith the Lord
[1:29:22] if you don't believe that go back to the
[1:29:24] beginning of this quote
[1:29:25] where he starts rattling these three
[1:29:28] phases of rapture off in the wrong order
[1:29:30] he did that because he was a man that
[1:29:33] doesn't make him false it makes him a
[1:29:34] human
[1:29:35] and we didn't need him to give us the
[1:29:38] perfect order we had first Thessalonians
[1:29:40] to tell us
[1:29:42] so we just take what he said and compare
[1:29:44] it there to the word
[1:29:46] brother Branham was like a wave Chief
[1:29:48] offering I'm not ashamed to tell it I
[1:29:50] don't care what they say
[1:29:51] he was a wave Chief offering over the
[1:29:54] heads of the people because he was the
[1:29:56] first son in in this end time to come to
[1:29:59] maturity but he was not the only son
[1:30:03] [Music]
[1:30:06] he was the first fruits
[1:30:08] there must be a bride coming along
[1:30:11] that'll manifest the same Life of Christ
[1:30:13] that will manifest the same seed
[1:30:19] the true seed for known in Jehovah's
[1:30:25] great mind
[1:30:27] in these last days will bring forth of
[1:30:32] his kind and they'll not be ashamed to
[1:30:38] be called by his name for these are the
[1:30:43] certified seed
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:30:48] you don't know what a privilege that is
[1:30:50] [Music]
[1:30:52] are you listening to me
[1:30:54] what a privilege that is to be a carrier
[1:30:57] of certified seed
[1:31:01] some of you is not going to make it some
[1:31:03] of you
[1:31:04] is not going to make it
[1:31:06] it's going to have to fall off
[1:31:09] it's going to have to go to the fire
[1:31:11] it's going to have to be burned
[1:31:13] but the seed in you
[1:31:15] Hallelujah
[1:31:18] it's going to ripen in the presence of
[1:31:20] the son
[1:31:21] amen every time we get under that Glory
[1:31:24] something is taking place
[1:31:26] all right are you with me now
[1:31:29] all right I want us to to move on
[1:31:32] when we were gathered together last and
[1:31:35] I just need maybe 20 more minutes
[1:31:37] something like that
[1:31:39] which will be short and short
[1:31:44] oh thank you brother will you come help
[1:31:46] me pack for Tucson
[1:31:52] you know what I believe that I don't
[1:31:54] even let my wife help me pack
[1:31:57] because I want to stay married forever
[1:32:01] I don't want to get out to Tucson and
[1:32:03] not have what I need and have her to
[1:32:04] blame so if I get out there and don't
[1:32:06] have what I need it's not my own fault I
[1:32:08] can't blame nobody but myself isn't that
[1:32:10] right
[1:32:14] I want to just give you this little
[1:32:16] quote here 6 37 Christ is the mystery of
[1:32:19] God revealed then I want to draw a
[1:32:20] little parallel for you that we didn't
[1:32:22] get to last week
[1:32:24] not knowing of course
[1:32:28] being spiritual this is Christ is a
[1:32:30] mystery of God revealed paragraph 637.
[1:32:34] not knowing this God knows it
[1:32:37] but if you'll turn and look at the clock
[1:32:40] it's on the DOT
[1:32:42] two o'clock oh my that must have been a
[1:32:45] long service
[1:32:50] did I say 20 or 30 minutes more I need
[1:32:52] an hour thank you
[1:32:54] he said the end of the second pool
[1:32:59] the third poll is at hand
[1:33:02] now last Sunday I I now know what year
[1:33:05] was that that was that was 7 28
[1:33:09] July 28th
[1:33:12] of 1963.
[1:33:15] is that right
[1:33:17] how many years ago
[1:33:21] 60 years ago
[1:33:23] because we are now 2023
[1:33:27] in fact we're coming in to
[1:33:30] August
[1:33:32] you you say oh no no no this is no we
[1:33:34] hadn't reached July yet well look in my
[1:33:36] life it just runs together
[1:33:39] it's all in the summer but we're already
[1:33:40] in the summer so before you know it
[1:33:43] August will be here in 60 years have
[1:33:46] passed
[1:33:48] and brother Branham is saying that in
[1:33:50] the third pool or the second pool the
[1:33:52] second pull of his ministry has come to
[1:33:55] an end and the third poll is coming in
[1:33:58] it is at hand
[1:34:00] now what I want you to understand and
[1:34:03] I'll share that with you for you take a
[1:34:04] moment I read to you last Sunday some of
[1:34:07] you were not here but I read to you the
[1:34:10] vision
[1:34:11] that we use to explain the third pool
[1:34:17] and these various things that took place
[1:34:21] specifically the fishing you remember it
[1:34:24] how many of you were here and you heard
[1:34:26] it
[1:34:27] you've got to be careful that the first
[1:34:30] time you just pull the line a little bit
[1:34:35] that causes the fish to go after the
[1:34:38] bait he thinks he's going to lose it
[1:34:40] that causes the fish to go after the
[1:34:43] bait and so what does he do he swallows
[1:34:45] the bait he he lays down on it you know
[1:34:48] he opened wide his mouth and says no no
[1:34:50] no you swims a little faster you're not
[1:34:53] getting away from me
[1:34:56] and so then the second time it pulls
[1:34:58] then you give it a real good pull
[1:35:02] to set the hook
[1:35:05] now brother Branham was being taught
[1:35:08] spiritually how to fish
[1:35:10] and he made a blunder
[1:35:13] he snatched too hard before it was time
[1:35:16] so he caught a fish all right if you
[1:35:19] remember the vision
[1:35:21] he caught a fish all right but it looked
[1:35:24] like a little minnow
[1:35:26] like a sardine
[1:35:28] skin stretched over the lure
[1:35:33] and the line got tangled up
[1:35:37] and what was that that the angel said
[1:35:43] don't let your line
[1:35:46] in in these kinds of times
[1:35:51] will you give me just a moment let me
[1:35:53] see if I could find that I didn't want
[1:35:55] to go there but
[1:35:56] oh
[1:35:59] that girl is something else
[1:36:02] he said I said I I know I did did you
[1:36:05] amen Josh that girl something else did
[1:36:07] you say man I heard sister
[1:36:09] I said I know I didn't do right I said I
[1:36:13] jerked it when I ought into he said
[1:36:16] don't get your line tangled up in these
[1:36:20] kinds of times I want to say that to you
[1:36:22] and I this morning let us not get our
[1:36:25] lines Tangled oh I felt something
[1:36:28] oh I felt something in that
[1:36:31] it reminds me song
[1:36:39] she wrote that song that in times like
[1:36:43] these
[1:36:46] we need the Bible
[1:36:49] in times like these we be not idle
[1:36:54] be very sure be very sure your Anchor
[1:36:58] Holds and grips the solid rock this rock
[1:37:01] is Jesus
[1:37:03] he's the one this rock is Jesus the only
[1:37:08] one be very sure be very sure your
[1:37:11] Anchor Holds and grips the solid rock I
[1:37:14] think of that when I think of this the
[1:37:17] word being spoken don't get your line
[1:37:20] tangled up in these kinds of times but
[1:37:23] folks there's young people there's no
[1:37:26] time to play now
[1:37:32] I'm going to say something very plain
[1:37:35] here
[1:37:36] I'm gonna say something very very plain
[1:37:39] I want to say something very very plain
[1:37:41] are you ready are you ready are you
[1:37:43] ready
[1:37:44] I read the testimony of someone who who
[1:37:47] grew up around the truth
[1:37:50] and they said they never had had the
[1:37:52] Holy Ghost and that they literally had
[1:37:55] prayed that the Rapture would not take
[1:37:59] place because they had never had sexual
[1:38:02] relations yet
[1:38:06] I want you to know that this is a very
[1:38:09] uh uh oh I knew it'd get quiet
[1:38:13] you can't believe an old prude like me
[1:38:15] would even say something like that I I
[1:38:18] said there's something wrong with this
[1:38:19] picture here I understand that God has
[1:38:23] given us this for merit listen if you're
[1:38:25] not married
[1:38:28] and you're having sexual relations you
[1:38:30] are in fornication
[1:38:32] and somebody ought to look you in the
[1:38:34] eye and tell you you're going to miss
[1:38:36] heaven
[1:38:38] until you make that thing right
[1:38:44] and that means petting
[1:38:47] putting your hand where it don't belong
[1:38:49] putting your lips where they don't
[1:38:51] belong come on
[1:38:53] I don't have to spell it out for you you
[1:38:56] don't need a health class
[1:38:58] that is something given as a gift it's
[1:39:01] not yours to take
[1:39:04] until you're married and then it's given
[1:39:06] to you as a gift from God
[1:39:08] to draw you and your spouse together
[1:39:17] don't you get uh jelly on me now
[1:39:22] put your backbone up
[1:39:24] somebody's got to tell it
[1:39:27] why brother Branham told us we don't
[1:39:29] even kiss we shouldn't even kiss unless
[1:39:31] we're married
[1:39:34] because it causes a reaction in the in
[1:39:37] the chemistry of the body
[1:39:40] hello
[1:39:44] and here's this person that's so focused
[1:39:46] on that uh something they've never
[1:39:49] experienced so focused on that that
[1:39:52] they're hoping that we can be here long
[1:39:54] enough
[1:39:56] for them to get married so they'll be
[1:39:59] able to experience that do you
[1:40:02] understand that the world around us is
[1:40:04] going to hell in a handbasket
[1:40:07] there's nothing wrong with you thinking
[1:40:09] about your future but that cannot be
[1:40:12] your only focus
[1:40:15] we need to focus on being Rapture Ready
[1:40:18] we need to focus on getting everything
[1:40:21] under the blood getting the stock out of
[1:40:24] the way so the seed of Christ can live
[1:40:27] and thrive in US
[1:40:30] don't get your eyes on oh I just I want
[1:40:33] to be here long enough to have a house
[1:40:35] of my own
[1:40:37] you're not going to worry about that in
[1:40:39] eternity
[1:40:40] I I don't want to call you selfish but
[1:40:43] if you're trying to hold us here now
[1:40:45] God's not paying attention to your silly
[1:40:46] prayer anyway but if you're trying to
[1:40:49] hold us here
[1:40:52] so you can
[1:40:54] use those Pinterest
[1:40:59] [Music]
[1:41:02] you that's got your baby names picked
[1:41:06] and you both case design
[1:41:10] and your colors chosen
[1:41:12] that's all right I think you ought to
[1:41:14] think ahead
[1:41:18] nothing wrong with a little planning but
[1:41:20] don't you try to hold me here so your
[1:41:22] Pinterest can get fulfilled
[1:41:26] oh Hallelujah
[1:41:28] we want out of here whenever he'll let
[1:41:30] us go
[1:41:33] and we're not leaving here a sick group
[1:41:35] broken down in feeble come on
[1:41:39] he's going to have a resurrected bride
[1:41:42] [Applause]
[1:41:47] don't get your line Tangled Up and
[1:41:49] things Con in these kinds of times these
[1:41:52] kind of times don't don't get to looking
[1:41:54] at things that don't matter for the hour
[1:41:55] starting to look loose I mean this I
[1:41:58] must sound like the Fogie that preached
[1:42:01] to me when I was a kid
[1:42:05] I would hear those Old-Timers preach
[1:42:06] sometime and I think that's easy for you
[1:42:08] old brother
[1:42:11] so I must be the old brother
[1:42:14] and you must be sitting there thinking
[1:42:16] well you wouldn't be saying that if you
[1:42:17] was in our place
[1:42:22] well I have to I have good some good
[1:42:24] news for you we're closer to getting out
[1:42:26] of this world
[1:42:31] Hallelujah
[1:42:32] than we've ever been before I promise
[1:42:35] you one breath of Eternity you won't
[1:42:36] feel cheated out of fulfilling your
[1:42:39] Pinterest board you won't feel cheated
[1:42:41] if you leave here unmarried
[1:42:44] thank you
[1:42:46] [Applause]
[1:42:48] I'll be crucified for saying this
[1:42:51] but you may find a big surprise for you
[1:42:54] when you get over there in eternity
[1:43:00] we need to focus right now on being
[1:43:03] ready
[1:43:06] Jesus had three pulls in his ministry
[1:43:09] Noah had three pulls in his ministry we
[1:43:13] see those three pools all the way
[1:43:15] through the scripture I'm one who
[1:43:17] preaches the bride must also operate in
[1:43:20] three pools
[1:43:21] [Music]
[1:43:23] I believe God allowed brother Brandon to
[1:43:25] be an example for the generation to
[1:43:28] follow
[1:43:29] and we are the generation to follow the
[1:43:31] ministry of the Prophet yes and that's
[1:43:34] why you'll hear me preaching that there
[1:43:36] still should be Miracles and signs and
[1:43:38] wonders even though that made up the
[1:43:40] first pull of the ministry of Christ and
[1:43:43] the first pull of the ministry of
[1:43:44] brother random but I say the bride must
[1:43:46] also have that same kind of pattern
[1:43:54] Miracles and signs and wonders and
[1:43:56] healings
[1:43:58] that then begin to be prophesying in
[1:44:01] visions and discerning
[1:44:03] that led to the third pool
[1:44:09] which was the word of God being opened
[1:44:13] now if it was truly open to generation
[1:44:16] ago I believe that but I also believe
[1:44:18] that we must have a personal encounter
[1:44:21] with the opening of the word
[1:44:23] I believe there's something you better
[1:44:25] hear this you who study I believe there
[1:44:28] are some seals in you and I that need to
[1:44:31] be opened up
[1:44:32] [Applause]
[1:44:35] there are some things that's been sealed
[1:44:37] up in US
[1:44:39] that the lamb wants to open up
[1:44:44] so in that third pool Ministry uh uh uh
[1:44:48] well in there is also the rebuking of
[1:44:50] the religious
[1:44:52] you see that was part of the second pool
[1:44:54] when brother random's Ministry started
[1:44:56] moving from the magnet of healing and
[1:44:59] signs and wonders and miracles then the
[1:45:01] next thing you know he starts moving
[1:45:04] into prophesying
[1:45:06] and telling visions
[1:45:09] and Visions leading to wonderful things
[1:45:12] happening and taking place then he
[1:45:14] starts rebuking the organized religion
[1:45:16] of his day the same thing Jesus did
[1:45:19] Jesus healed first Jesus performed signs
[1:45:22] and wonders and miracles first until he
[1:45:25] captured the attention of the people
[1:45:26] then he turned in real and rebuked the
[1:45:30] denominations of his name are you
[1:45:32] following this he rebuked organized
[1:45:35] religion of his day
[1:45:40] and then the third pull of the of the
[1:45:42] ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ didn't
[1:45:44] take place until after his crucifixion
[1:45:46] because in order for the third pull to
[1:45:49] be fully activate there has to be a
[1:45:50] death
[1:45:52] and even in the ministry of brother
[1:45:54] Brandon I'm sorry that I'm speaking like
[1:45:56] this with some Among Us not
[1:45:58] understanding these analogies and so
[1:46:00] forth but you only have so much time
[1:46:04] but remember this is how brother
[1:46:06] branham's Ministry began to shift and
[1:46:08] and although it was so hard on him and
[1:46:11] so difficult for him he had to start
[1:46:12] rebuking
[1:46:14] the way the businessmen were behaving
[1:46:17] and the way they were whining and dining
[1:46:19] with the Roman Catholics
[1:46:23] she was all right as long as the
[1:46:24] Catholics were getting the Holy Spirit
[1:46:26] and coming out of that organization
[1:46:28] but then the ecumenical movement the
[1:46:30] charismatic movement started breaking
[1:46:32] out and they started staying in the
[1:46:34] error
[1:46:36] and continuing to speak in tongues and
[1:46:39] then brother Branham because he was a
[1:46:41] prophet because he had another phase of
[1:46:43] ministry coming that he had to start
[1:46:45] rebuking that thing
[1:46:47] and he said we can't take communion like
[1:46:49] the Roman Catholic State communion come
[1:46:51] on and they started shutting him down
[1:46:54] Full Gospel businessmen Assemblies of
[1:46:56] God Church of God all those groups that
[1:46:59] had supported his ministry and and had
[1:47:01] wanted him to pray for all their sick
[1:47:03] people they began to shut him down
[1:47:06] until he also went through a time of
[1:47:08] just resting
[1:47:14] remember tent vision
[1:47:17] he went through a time of just resting
[1:47:21] and then he was raised up above the room
[1:47:24] we read it last Sunday he was raised up
[1:47:27] above the little place of intimacy
[1:47:28] looking down on what was to take place
[1:47:31] and the angel of the Lord said I will
[1:47:33] meet you
[1:47:34] in there
[1:47:36] not in a place of religion
[1:47:39] but in a place of you and Jesus
[1:47:43] that's relationship
[1:47:45] I want you to know you can wear the
[1:47:46] uniform
[1:47:48] you can follow all the church rules
[1:47:50] and be lost
[1:47:52] your women can have long hair
[1:47:55] and be lost
[1:47:59] it's not those are not what saves us
[1:48:02] these are gifts that we give to Jesus
[1:48:04] Christ because we believe he's called us
[1:48:05] to be a parable to a world that's going
[1:48:07] in the opposite direction
[1:48:09] but our Salvation doesn't come by these
[1:48:11] things oh no and so when we see people
[1:48:15] compromising on these things it breaks
[1:48:17] our heart
[1:48:18] because we know that Jesus is not
[1:48:20] receiving the reward
[1:48:22] that the lamb deserves
[1:48:26] when you start fooling around with you
[1:48:28] sister start fooling around with the
[1:48:29] glory that's on top of your head
[1:48:31] [Music]
[1:48:33] you are not giving the lamb the reward
[1:48:35] he deserves
[1:48:41] it said keep the scissors out of it
[1:48:45] come on now somebody said is that's just
[1:48:47] some kind of Doctrine you're bringing no
[1:48:49] I think I read it right in the book
[1:48:51] if I remember correctly I read it in the
[1:48:54] book in fact I think I read it in the
[1:48:56] New Testament in fact I think I read it
[1:48:58] in the book of Corinthians
[1:49:00] where Paul says it's glory
[1:49:04] a woman's long hair is given her for a
[1:49:08] glory on her head
[1:49:10] there's power there
[1:49:12] I want you to know a woman who has long
[1:49:15] hair has Authority in prayer
[1:49:18] you want to get a prayer through you you
[1:49:21] need some help and prayer support you
[1:49:23] find you one of these sisters that has
[1:49:25] chosen to swim against the current of
[1:49:28] modern society you say sis pray for me
[1:49:35] that's what the word says
[1:49:37] it'd be different if we were preaching a
[1:49:39] church doctrine there
[1:49:40] why are you preaching that this morning
[1:49:42] because I see how that enemy wants to
[1:49:45] steal the authority of the sister
[1:49:47] he wants to steal the brother's
[1:49:49] authority too
[1:49:51] so let me say one more time before I
[1:49:54] have to come to you personally Brothers
[1:49:55] you need some bigger britches
[1:50:00] this is the last Pulpit warning
[1:50:04] I'm going to come to some of you
[1:50:07] nobody wants to see your junk
[1:50:17] I believe I'll take a little water now
[1:50:23] you see me
[1:50:25] you see me I'll help you buy them
[1:50:27] you see me
[1:50:29] if it's a matter of Economics I'll make
[1:50:32] sure you get some bigger genes some
[1:50:33] bigger britches
[1:50:35] I don't want you to I don't want you to
[1:50:37] be in a I've been there
[1:50:40] I've been over the barrel
[1:50:42] I know what it means not to be able to
[1:50:44] afford to do better than you're doing
[1:50:47] you don't have to use that
[1:50:49] I'll help you
[1:50:51] we don't want the enemy to be able to
[1:50:54] take anything away
[1:50:55] from our testimony
[1:50:59] our lives are living Epistles read by
[1:51:02] all men
[1:51:04] God wants us to be clean before the Lord
[1:51:08] some of you do dads and all this stuff
[1:51:10] and stuff that people want in this last
[1:51:13] day it worries me it's like the sister
[1:51:15] over there who testified I I didn't want
[1:51:18] to go in the Rapture because I hadn't
[1:51:20] had sexual relations
[1:51:22] you're just kind of playing with fire
[1:51:24] when you start inching your way toward
[1:51:27] the world I know you get mad at me I
[1:51:30] know you do I'm sure you must but I have
[1:51:33] been through this thing in decades in
[1:51:36] cycles and I've watched the world creep
[1:51:40] in and I've watched the testimonies fall
[1:51:43] to the Wayside I've watched the world
[1:51:45] swallow up kids that were raised in the
[1:51:49] truth and had had a touch of God in
[1:51:52] their life so I am Duty bound and
[1:51:54] responsible to tell you the truth and
[1:51:57] I'm not just preaching to your children
[1:51:59] I'm preaching to mine
[1:52:02] I'm responsible to do so
[1:52:06] because the bride yeah
[1:52:09] has got a Ministry
[1:52:12] she's got a Ministry
[1:52:14] all right we're moving on now
[1:52:17] you still with me did I already use my
[1:52:19] 20 minutes I did
[1:52:21] I need 20 more
[1:52:24] in paragraph 339
[1:52:27] I feel good
[1:52:30] it's Father's Day I feel good
[1:52:33] I'm doing what I love on Father's Day
[1:52:35] Hallelujah
[1:52:38] when I'm done here I'm going to do
[1:52:40] something else I love
[1:52:42] I'm going to eat filet mignon
[1:52:47] and take extra vitamin C so they don't
[1:52:50] hurt my foot
[1:52:53] paragraph 339 God hiding himself in
[1:52:57] Simplicity then revealing himself in the
[1:52:59] same and that was on the notes from
[1:53:00] today I believe
[1:53:02] but now wait
[1:53:04] in closing we say this
[1:53:09] but to reject
[1:53:12] God's simple message
[1:53:17] to reject it
[1:53:19] God's simple way
[1:53:22] is to be destroyed
[1:53:25] eternally
[1:53:29] it's better for some
[1:53:31] to have never heard the truth
[1:53:35] than to have heard the truth and to
[1:53:38] reject it
[1:53:40] God's simple way now that we talk how
[1:53:44] simple it is and people think well they
[1:53:46] can laugh at it and run over it I see
[1:53:48] some of you sometimes sneering a little
[1:53:50] bit
[1:53:51] they can laugh at it and run over it and
[1:53:54] treat it any way they want to but it's
[1:53:57] Eternal separation from God now wait a
[1:53:59] minute before you change the slide
[1:54:00] Nathan what is eternal separation from
[1:54:04] God to reject
[1:54:06] God's simple message
[1:54:10] to reject God some away somebody said oh
[1:54:13] dear God brother Shelley I I knew better
[1:54:16] and I went away and I and and and and I
[1:54:18] did a little and and I got caught up in
[1:54:20] some unbelief and so forth am I
[1:54:22] destroyed am I savable don't don't get
[1:54:26] in that kind of a panic
[1:54:28] that's not what we're talking about
[1:54:30] we're talking about somebody coming into
[1:54:33] the opportunity to receive the the
[1:54:35] Simplicity of the message and then
[1:54:38] rejecting it because of their
[1:54:40] denominational mindset or come around
[1:54:42] saying well the preachers aren't
[1:54:43] educated
[1:54:48] there are people out there that want to
[1:54:50] know uh uh my my degree
[1:54:53] [Music]
[1:54:58] it's DD
[1:55:03] not Doctorate of divinity
[1:55:07] but a demon Destroyer yes
[1:55:11] you tell them
[1:55:13] we're not in this
[1:55:17] is wrong with that I have a few smart
[1:55:20] friends
[1:55:23] not too many
[1:55:27] but to educate yourself out of the SIM
[1:55:29] city of the Gospel
[1:55:31] [Music]
[1:55:33] that's dangerous business
[1:55:36] he said now God's simple way is now
[1:55:38] that's a treat it anyway they want to
[1:55:40] but it's Eternal separation from god
[1:55:43] let's go on
[1:55:44] those who died in the days of Noah now
[1:55:47] listen
[1:55:48] those who died in the days of Noah and
[1:55:50] did not listen to his message what
[1:55:53] happened to them they perish and Jesus
[1:55:56] went and preached to them
[1:56:00] in the chains of darkness in his death
[1:56:04] before he rose up leave it there a
[1:56:06] moment
[1:56:08] this is the final phase of the third
[1:56:12] pool
[1:56:14] in the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:56:18] first pull healing miracles signs and
[1:56:23] wonders
[1:56:24] second poll the Visions the opening of
[1:56:29] Truth really we could say the same the
[1:56:32] ministry of Christ he starts revealing
[1:56:35] God revealing the godhead like it had
[1:56:38] never been revealed before
[1:56:40] but there were there were also
[1:56:42] discernment coming in and many many
[1:56:44] things in that in that second pool
[1:56:47] prophesying
[1:56:50] uh rebuking the religious crowd the
[1:56:55] organized religion of his day and then
[1:56:57] he comes into the third pool after his
[1:56:59] crucifixion
[1:57:00] when he descends Into the Heart of the
[1:57:02] Earth
[1:57:04] he leads captivity captive gives gifts
[1:57:06] unto me and the Bible said
[1:57:08] and he preaches to those who are
[1:57:12] reserved in darkness
[1:57:15] we call that
[1:57:17] place first Paradise
[1:57:21] for those who died in the righteousness
[1:57:24] that they knew
[1:57:25] in the next compartment if you want to
[1:57:28] describe it that way as hell
[1:57:30] he visited both
[1:57:32] he preached to those who had never had
[1:57:35] the opportunity to know the reality that
[1:57:38] he was the one
[1:57:40] they saw him and received him gladly and
[1:57:43] many of the Saints which slept which had
[1:57:45] already died arose and walked again the
[1:57:48] streets of Jerusalem the gospels tell us
[1:57:50] amen and then he goes into hell and he
[1:57:53] takes the keys of death Hell In The
[1:57:55] Grave off of Satan's keychain
[1:58:00] and his presence there by being there
[1:58:03] he's fulfilling the third part of his
[1:58:05] ministry to the eternally Damned
[1:58:09] can you imagine to be reserved in those
[1:58:11] flames in that place of Eternal
[1:58:13] punishment and when I say Eternal it's
[1:58:15] because it has an ending
[1:58:20] and once it ends that's forever
[1:58:23] so don't don't get caught up in the
[1:58:25] whole concept
[1:58:27] in fact the most awful punishment that
[1:58:30] anyone is ever going to know
[1:58:32] is losing their god-consciousness
[1:58:38] never knowing again
[1:58:42] never remembering
[1:58:44] the soul that sinneth shall
[1:58:48] he's preaching to those who cannot be
[1:58:51] saved
[1:58:54] why because they had to have a judgment
[1:58:56] against him
[1:58:58] brother Branham talks about the third
[1:59:00] pool of his own Ministry
[1:59:03] and that a portion of that will go
[1:59:07] to a people that cannot be saved
[1:59:09] because they've rejected the Simplicity
[1:59:11] of the message it's not that they didn't
[1:59:13] have an opportunity
[1:59:15] it's that God in his foreknowledge saw
[1:59:18] that when the Simplicity of the truth
[1:59:19] was presented to them they would find
[1:59:21] themselves too good for it
[1:59:23] to educated for it come on to starchy
[1:59:27] for it they didn't want this Old Holy
[1:59:30] Ghost away that's dripping with blood
[1:59:33] they didn't want the way of the Holy
[1:59:34] Apostles they didn't want the way of the
[1:59:37] suffering so on asunder uh dwelt in
[1:59:40] caves
[1:59:42] dressed in camel skins
[1:59:45] the despised few
[1:59:47] and God saw that about them in eternity
[1:59:50] past before the foundation of the world
[1:59:53] and a portion of the bride's Ministry
[1:59:55] here's what you need to know if Noah had
[1:59:57] a third pool first second third pool and
[2:00:00] Jesus had a first second third pool if
[2:00:03] brother branham's Ministry had a first
[2:00:04] second third pool so will yours
[2:00:09] it's a typology of the scripture
[2:00:11] so will yours and that means a part of
[2:00:14] what you do
[2:00:16] will be done before those
[2:00:19] who cannot be saved
[2:00:23] boy that's a message that ought to shake
[2:00:26] somebody
[2:00:27] not because they're not savable
[2:00:30] but because in the mind of God he saw
[2:00:32] them before the before the foundation of
[2:00:34] the world and and saw in his
[2:00:37] foreknowledge that they would choose to
[2:00:38] reject him
[2:00:40] and so there's going to be a whole lot
[2:00:41] of Pentecostals and a whole lot of
[2:00:43] charismatics and a whole lot of people
[2:00:45] in the last days who see a portion of
[2:00:47] the bride's Revival
[2:00:49] who will want to be a part of what God
[2:00:51] is doing but will not be able to be
[2:00:53] fully partakers of that because they're
[2:00:56] already in Chains
[2:01:02] that's nothing to shout about I wouldn't
[2:01:04] want you to jump up and shout over that
[2:01:07] but I wouldn't want you to reject it
[2:01:08] because it goes against your flesh
[2:01:10] either
[2:01:13] brother Branham when God worked through
[2:01:15] him in signs and wonders and miracles
[2:01:16] everybody saw it
[2:01:18] but not everybody believed it that's how
[2:01:21] it'll be in the bride's third pool
[2:01:24] everybody may have a chance to see it
[2:01:27] but everybody won't jump in
[2:01:29] but you won't be so concerned about that
[2:01:32] you'll be concerned about reflecting
[2:01:34] Jesus Christ
[2:01:36] you'll be concerned about being the
[2:01:37] fully manifested sons of God you'll be
[2:01:40] concerned about your full adoption is
[2:01:43] anybody with me
[2:01:44] Jesus went and preached to them in the
[2:01:46] chains of darkness in his death before
[2:01:48] he rose up and he went to hell and
[2:01:51] preached to the spirits that was in
[2:01:53] prison that repented not in the
[2:01:55] long-suffering of the days of Noah while
[2:01:58] a simple message of God by a simple man
[2:02:00] was being preached
[2:02:02] I want you to know they not only had the
[2:02:04] the condemnation of the preaching of
[2:02:06] Noah
[2:02:07] but reserved in Hell had the
[2:02:09] condemnation of the preaching of Jesus
[2:02:11] Christ
[2:02:12] he preached to those who were totally
[2:02:14] lost and were there because they had
[2:02:17] rejected the message of Noah
[2:02:19] now God is really particular about how
[2:02:22] we treat His prophets
[2:02:24] and God is really particular about how
[2:02:27] we treat the message they bring anybody
[2:02:29] with us is that too much to say
[2:02:32] all right now I want to close with this
[2:02:34] yeah I don't believe it yep believe it
[2:02:37] I just didn't say how long this is
[2:02:40] in the message Souls that are in prison
[2:02:42] now
[2:02:43] thank you Brothers thank you so many
[2:02:45] streaming the service wishing us happy
[2:02:48] Father's Day thank you every one of you
[2:02:50] thank you so much you're kind I was
[2:02:53] blessed this morning I woke up early and
[2:02:54] I already had greetings from all over
[2:02:56] the world many many kind things precious
[2:02:59] pastors from countries abroad thanking
[2:03:03] me for being a spiritual dad I cannot
[2:03:06] tell you what that means to me
[2:03:08] I I really really appreciate it in the
[2:03:11] in paragraph 275 Souls that are in
[2:03:13] prison now
[2:03:15] I think you will I think this will help
[2:03:17] you
[2:03:18] and then we will put this aside
[2:03:21] I knew that if I forced myself to go in
[2:03:24] and do the Father's Day message that by
[2:03:26] the time you heard me again
[2:03:28] you would have lost some of what we had
[2:03:31] regained last Sunday so I feel like this
[2:03:34] was the Lord I don't want to go so far
[2:03:36] as to say he hung up the gifts because
[2:03:40] it was much to my uh
[2:03:42] nerves that really affected me
[2:03:45] knowing that I was going to have to get
[2:03:47] up here and say I'm sorry Dad you're the
[2:03:48] greatest in the world but I but your
[2:03:50] president didn't make it
[2:03:52] but I believe God does have a plan for
[2:03:54] all things
[2:03:55] I'm hurrying
[2:03:57] Jesus ministry was when he was Healing
[2:04:00] The Sick he was wonderful the young
[2:04:02] prophet of Galilee why makes the blind
[2:04:04] to see he even raised the dead we got
[2:04:07] three cases of it he actually raised the
[2:04:11] Dead
[2:04:12] now this is how the first pull Ministry
[2:04:14] of Jesus was the crowds came
[2:04:17] this is how the First full ministry of
[2:04:19] Noah was the crowds came
[2:04:22] this is how the first pull Ministry of
[2:04:23] brother Branham was the crowds came
[2:04:28] it may be how the first pool Ministry of
[2:04:31] the Bride is the crowds may be
[2:04:33] interested
[2:04:34] but there's a thinning of the crowd
[2:04:35] every time
[2:04:37] is that right let's go on
[2:04:40] but one day he turned around and said
[2:04:42] you Generation of Vipers you make
[2:04:45] outside of the platter clean you appear
[2:04:47] to be holy but the inside of you are
[2:04:49] nothing but a bunch of snakes that's
[2:04:51] pretty rough preaching isn't it you
[2:04:53] think I get rough sometime
[2:04:55] oh when that prophecy went forth
[2:04:57] condemning that organization it changed
[2:04:59] then they turned against him that's
[2:05:01] right and finally by rejecting him what
[2:05:03] did they do
[2:05:04] They Crucified him
[2:05:06] if you'll remember that just at the end
[2:05:08] of the second pool
[2:05:10] uh toward the end of the second pool of
[2:05:13] brother branham's Ministry Christ was
[2:05:14] crucified again
[2:05:19] in a message called the indictment
[2:05:23] I indict this generation for the second
[2:05:26] crucifixion of Jesus Christ somebody
[2:05:28] said how could anybody make such a
[2:05:30] statement as that because they crucified
[2:05:32] Christ the word
[2:05:35] to crucify the word is equally serious
[2:05:39] to crucifying the man what
[2:05:41] denominational system in the earth now
[2:05:43] hasn't crucified Christ the word I know
[2:05:46] that's rough
[2:05:47] but do you know of a denominational
[2:05:49] system out there that hasn't crucified
[2:05:51] the word
[2:05:53] to take their Creed
[2:05:56] and we could go right on and on and on
[2:05:58] all these borrowed Traditions from Pagan
[2:06:00] Rome
[2:06:03] and even those who claim to not be Pagan
[2:06:06] die their Easter eggs and lay them on
[2:06:08] the dime red and lay on the Methodist
[2:06:09] and lay them on the altar
[2:06:12] some of the things they do around
[2:06:14] communion is nothing in the world but
[2:06:16] borrowed from the Harlot system of Rome
[2:06:19] that's a serious business that bread
[2:06:22] doesn't become the literal body of Jesus
[2:06:24] Christ that wine doesn't become the
[2:06:26] literal blood you don't need the
[2:06:28] electrical body you are the literal body
[2:06:31] [Applause]
[2:06:33] you don't need the little blood you have
[2:06:36] become the literal blood somebody said
[2:06:38] what in what do you mean yes bought with
[2:06:40] a prize
[2:06:42] you're no longer who you were
[2:06:45] you're not that old man you've been
[2:06:48] bought by the broken body and the shed
[2:06:50] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:06:53] she is him
[2:06:58] well that was glorious
[2:07:01] when that prophecy went forth condemning
[2:07:03] the organization a chain turn against
[2:07:05] him finally rejected him they crucified
[2:07:07] him
[2:07:08] but you can you can't oh you can't kill
[2:07:13] the ministry
[2:07:15] it lives on
[2:07:16] even Dr Google can't can't kill the real
[2:07:19] Ministry
[2:07:20] you can put the messenger to sleep
[2:07:26] but you can't put the message to sleep
[2:07:30] right he lived on
[2:07:32] and notice when the third pull of his
[2:07:35] ministry come the first was Healing The
[2:07:37] Sick I just wanted to get this to you uh
[2:07:40] from him the first was Healing The Sick
[2:07:42] let's go on the second was rebuking the
[2:07:44] organizations and prophesying what they
[2:07:47] had done what they were and what was
[2:07:49] coming what is what is what will come
[2:07:52] what was what is what will come that's
[2:07:54] what he done is that right and the
[2:07:56] congregation set him in but his third
[2:07:58] poll
[2:07:59] was when he preached to the lost that
[2:08:03] couldn't be saved no more
[2:08:07] they couldn't cross that Gulf
[2:08:10] there was no Gulf between those who were
[2:08:12] in Paradise because they had never saw
[2:08:14] the coming of the Messiah there was no
[2:08:16] Gulf so when he steps in to all of those
[2:08:19] precious people who died under the law
[2:08:22] and that's not those who were rebelling
[2:08:24] against the law
[2:08:26] those who rebelled against the law were
[2:08:27] in hell
[2:08:29] but those who walked in all the light
[2:08:31] that had been given to them without the
[2:08:33] presence of the Messiah in the Earth
[2:08:36] they were taken into Paradise and as
[2:08:39] soon as Jesus made his appearance in the
[2:08:41] heart of the earth nobody had to
[2:08:42] convince him who he was
[2:08:47] their eyes puffed open and as I have
[2:08:49] told you many times you know Ezekiel
[2:08:51] said there is the wheel in the wheel
[2:08:54] Hallelujah uh Daniel there is the one
[2:08:58] who put the lines asleep and closed her
[2:08:59] mouth
[2:09:00] Shadrach me shaking the bed and go there
[2:09:02] he is the fourth man in the fire
[2:09:05] David there he is The Shepherd of Israel
[2:09:08] come on Hallelujah
[2:09:10] Abraham and Sarah there he is the one
[2:09:13] who visited with us in our tent
[2:09:17] there was no preaching don't need need
[2:09:19] necessary no sir he just showed up
[2:09:23] and there was no golf fix between them
[2:09:25] and God so they could just step across
[2:09:27] that Gulf and he led them out
[2:09:31] and many of the Saints would slept the
[2:09:32] rose
[2:09:34] but those on that other side of the gulf
[2:09:36] those that had already rejected
[2:09:38] salvation
[2:09:40] the message that came
[2:09:42] through the prophets beginning all the
[2:09:45] way back to the beginning
[2:09:46] they couldn't change their Eternal state
[2:09:49] his third pool which when he preached to
[2:09:51] the lost I got to stay with my notes got
[2:09:52] to stay with the paragraphs now so we
[2:09:54] can go preach to the law said couldn't
[2:09:55] be saved no more they were down there
[2:09:57] when the big painted eyes was oh
[2:10:02] brother bam is talking about his
[2:10:03] experience
[2:10:07] should I should I should I stay with my
[2:10:09] notes should I just read or should I
[2:10:11] make a little commentary here
[2:10:14] you know brother Branham had this
[2:10:15] experience in hell
[2:10:17] he saw those cat-eyed women
[2:10:23] I wished I could get a little help in
[2:10:24] here just to not will help don't be loud
[2:10:26] just a nod just to not
[2:10:28] it's nod
[2:10:29] he saw them cat-eyed women
[2:10:32] I see them everywhere I go
[2:10:34] he'd never seen him before
[2:10:36] I see him everywhere I go in my day he'd
[2:10:39] never seen him before
[2:10:40] he's downtown at Sears was it serious Am
[2:10:43] I Wrong JCPenney excuse me
[2:10:45] he's down in the in JCPenney and he sees
[2:10:48] him on the escalator
[2:10:51] after he had seen that kind of a look in
[2:10:54] hell he saw women with these big old
[2:10:56] painted black eyes in hell
[2:11:01] but it shook him to the core when he
[2:11:03] actually ran into a couple of them in in
[2:11:05] Tucson
[2:11:07] with their black painted eyes all that
[2:11:09] mascara and all that stuff they wear
[2:11:12] them spiders
[2:11:15] glue them on
[2:11:17] what woman in the right mind wants a
[2:11:20] spider on her forehead
[2:11:26] it Disturbed brother Branham
[2:11:29] of course the only other place that he
[2:11:31] had seen that kind of thing was hell
[2:11:36] why don't you help me
[2:11:38] wouldn't that disturb you
[2:11:40] what was one time relegated to hell is
[2:11:44] now walking Among Us
[2:11:47] it's not the it's not the thing it's the
[2:11:50] spirit that would cause somebody to want
[2:11:53] that
[2:11:54] it's that it's the spirit it's the
[2:11:57] spirit that confuses somebody in their
[2:11:59] gender they ignore their Plumbing
[2:12:03] they ignore their Plumbing because
[2:12:05] they're under a confused spirit
[2:12:08] it's someone rejecting and saying God
[2:12:10] didn't give me big enough eyelashes so I
[2:12:13] ready God's wrong again
[2:12:17] The Same Spirit God's wrong again
[2:12:20] he didn't didn't give me the right
[2:12:22] Plumbing he didn't give me the right
[2:12:24] eyelashes he didn't give me the right
[2:12:25] hair color he didn't give me the right
[2:12:36] his third pull all right they were down
[2:12:38] there all right let's go on 280. I gotta
[2:12:40] I gotta
[2:12:41] preach to the souls in hell that did not
[2:12:44] accept Mercy but were eternally
[2:12:46] separated from the presence of God
[2:12:47] that's going to be the great punishment
[2:12:49] to be eternally separated from the
[2:12:51] presence of God oh my but yet they had
[2:12:53] to recognize it what it was because God
[2:12:55] made him there
[2:12:56] wonder if his ministry climbs out the
[2:12:59] same way in the last days as it was as
[2:13:01] the father sent me so send I you the
[2:13:03] works that I do you shall do also loss
[2:13:06] could never be saved they had rejected
[2:13:08] Mercy that was his third pool
[2:13:12] now when that creative spoken word
[2:13:17] is fully operational in the bride
[2:13:21] it's not going to be to the benefit of
[2:13:23] those
[2:13:24] that are eternally lost
[2:13:27] it's going to be to the benefit of those
[2:13:29] who walk the walk
[2:13:34] that was his third pool let's go on
[2:13:38] now is there any question his first
[2:13:40] fully healed the sick is that right his
[2:13:42] second Ministry he was prophesying his
[2:13:44] third Ministry was preaching to the
[2:13:46] Eternal loss the three mountains so
[2:13:47] forth the Lost Eternal all right Noah's
[2:13:50] Ministry all Ministries done the same
[2:13:52] Noah preached that exactly right went
[2:13:54] into the ark and when he went to the art
[2:13:56] there were seven days and nothing
[2:13:57] happened his testimony preached to the
[2:13:59] doomed Sodom and Gomorrah Jesus referred
[2:14:02] to both of them as coming before the
[2:14:03] coming of the son of man so shall it be
[2:14:05] like the days of Noah so shall it be
[2:14:07] like it was in the days of Sodom he
[2:14:09] referred to Noah
[2:14:10] Noah had three pulls and his third was
[2:14:13] to the Lost after the door of the Ark
[2:14:15] was shut
[2:14:19] that door won't always be open
[2:14:23] one day the last Gentile is going to
[2:14:26] repent
[2:14:28] and be born again and the mercy to the
[2:14:30] Gentiles comes to an end and God returns
[2:14:34] to Israel he returns his Mercy to the
[2:14:37] original he chosen Hebrews what the word
[2:14:40] says he goes back to the Jew
[2:14:44] the Holy Ghost was to the Jew and to the
[2:14:46] Greek
[2:14:47] but the gospel returns there at the end
[2:14:50] when the last Gentile has come in
[2:14:54] for God let it all sit right there where
[2:14:56] nobody could enter or go out they were
[2:14:58] inside for as on the seventh Mountain
[2:14:59] the highest mountain that's where he
[2:15:01] settled the ark Mountain that's right
[2:15:03] we're talking about Ararat now let's go
[2:15:05] on in the days of Sodom the first pool
[2:15:07] was the righteous lot now here is an
[2:15:09] interesting shift to this as the
[2:15:12] musicians are coming
[2:15:15] here is an interesting shift to this
[2:15:19] prior
[2:15:21] to this and after this it seems that the
[2:15:25] third pool first second and third pool
[2:15:27] are different phases of the same
[2:15:29] Ministry
[2:15:31] using the same vessel
[2:15:34] but once it comes here we see God using
[2:15:39] different individuals to fulfill the
[2:15:43] different phases of the ministry
[2:15:46] just watch this it's interesting
[2:15:49] something I've noticed
[2:15:51] in the days of Sodom the first pull was
[2:15:54] the righteous lot and the Bible said the
[2:15:56] sins of Sodom vexed his righteous Soul
[2:15:58] daily how them women acted and done and
[2:16:01] it wasn't just the women by the way the
[2:16:03] men were burning in passion one for
[2:16:05] another molested the angels that came in
[2:16:07] to deliver them
[2:16:08] there was a lot of things going on
[2:16:11] sounds about like the hour we live in
[2:16:13] today
[2:16:14] celebrating Pride
[2:16:17] the very thing that got the world and
[2:16:18] the mess it's in today was Pride we're
[2:16:21] going to celebrate Pride
[2:16:23] I don't understand such a thing I think
[2:16:25] people ought to be treated equal
[2:16:28] you can say Amen now
[2:16:31] I don't think people should be
[2:16:32] mistreated because of their sexuality
[2:16:34] choice I don't think people should be
[2:16:36] mistreated because the color of their
[2:16:37] skin I no
[2:16:41] but I don't think that people should be
[2:16:43] celebrated to throw that in the face and
[2:16:46] especially before my children if I had
[2:16:48] small children
[2:16:51] we were in Amsterdam many years ago and
[2:16:53] had to stand over the the the the
[2:16:55] carriage the the stroller to keep our
[2:16:58] kids from seeing men and uh kissing men
[2:17:00] and women kissing women right on the
[2:17:02] streets of Amsterdam and here we are a
[2:17:05] bunch of hillbillies from from Alabama
[2:17:07] and we think my God we're in Sodom and
[2:17:10] now it has come to us
[2:17:15] and it's not equality I'm for I'm for
[2:17:17] treating people the same
[2:17:19] it's it's not about that
[2:17:22] if it was they wouldn't want a month
[2:17:25] they would want to be treated equal
[2:17:27] every day of the year
[2:17:29] their campaign would be let us just be
[2:17:32] just let us be just let us be citizens
[2:17:34] just let us just let us live our lives
[2:17:37] among you
[2:17:39] it wouldn't be celebrate us for one
[2:17:41] month and then harass us the rest of the
[2:17:43] time that this mentality is satanic
[2:17:46] you don't have to say man I'm convinced
[2:17:48] of it so as it was in the day he said no
[2:17:51] what are they doing eating drinking
[2:17:52] marrying giving in marriage women what
[2:17:54] what was it the days of soldering women
[2:17:55] the first message was lot they left him
[2:17:57] to scorn
[2:17:58] they they then they sent another
[2:18:00] messenger two of them that went down see
[2:18:03] here's another part and look what's his
[2:18:05] second pull four knot
[2:18:09] not a lot being the minister of the
[2:18:12] second pool
[2:18:13] but the two angels became the minister
[2:18:15] for the second pool
[2:18:18] and they went in forelot
[2:18:21] for Sodom let's go on
[2:18:24] but look at the one that went last
[2:18:26] there's more and more Mercy it was all
[2:18:29] over then all over at that time that
[2:18:33] third messenger that went down there the
[2:18:36] third pool what was he
[2:18:40] let's read what kind of ministry did he
[2:18:43] have he set with the elected and told
[2:18:46] them what was taking place behind them
[2:18:51] who is he describing
[2:18:55] but when he stepped off into Babylon or
[2:18:58] into Sodom he wanted to find
[2:19:00] even Abraham crying
[2:19:06] it's Abraham here
[2:19:11] God is using Abraham now
[2:19:14] lot the two Angel Messengers and now
[2:19:18] Abraham is standing between God and the
[2:19:20] people
[2:19:22] he said if I could find 50 righteous on
[2:19:24] down to 10 righteous God said yes find
[2:19:26] 10 righteous
[2:19:28] let me tell you something sister you
[2:19:29] might be old-fashioned but you've got
[2:19:31] something these sex queens has a god
[2:19:36] you got something they can she can never
[2:19:38] have you you might be old-fashioned in
[2:19:40] your dressing dress up like a lady they
[2:19:42] might say look at that old Holy Roller
[2:19:45] don't you worry she's got something that
[2:19:47] the little sex Queen that's got all the
[2:19:49] world looking at her out there she
[2:19:51] hasn't got it

[2:20:04] you got virtue she's got nothing
[2:20:07] she's got a bait that traps that lost
[2:20:09] soul into hell that bind blind walk into
[2:20:12] it now you've got something powerful

[2:20:46] that's holding the wrath of God
[2:20:52] you beautiful little sisters
[2:20:57] you humble Brothers
[2:21:01] you're the ones responsible for holding
[2:21:04] the wrath of God off the world today
[2:21:06] and one day you're going out of here
[2:21:09] the world that we leave behind will go
[2:21:12] totally insane because the restrainer
[2:21:14] leaves the scripture says when he that
[2:21:17] now liveth will lead until he be taken
[2:21:19] out of the way the restrainer is here
[2:21:21] the Holy Ghost is here when you leave
[2:21:23] the Holy Ghost leaves with you and the
[2:21:25] world plunges into total insanity

[2:21:36] Holy Roller you little man that don't
[2:21:37] hardly know anything but you cry to God
[2:21:39] day and night for the sins of the
[2:21:40] country you might be the one that's
[2:21:42] holding off the Wrath if I can find 10
[2:21:45] I'll spare it if I can find 10 as it was
[2:21:48] in the days of Sodom so shall it be see
[2:21:50] what I mean
[2:21:54] paragraph 294 know if I can find 10
[2:21:56] methodists if I can find ten Baptists if
[2:21:58] I can find 10 Pentecostals if I can find
[2:22:01] 10 athletes if I can find 10 Senators if
[2:22:04] I can find 10 ministers
[2:22:06] but if I can find 10 righteous
[2:22:10] there's one righteous that's Christ
[2:22:12] Christ Living in one them ten see I'll
[2:22:14] spare it
[2:22:16] but that last messenger preached to the
[2:22:18] doomed
[2:22:21] you say he went down there scripture
[2:22:23] don't say what happened but the fire
[2:22:24] fell the next morning
[2:22:26] after he performed those signs
[2:22:27] immediately after he performed his
[2:22:29] prophecy Ministry
[2:22:31] why did Sarah laugh she said I didn't
[2:22:34] she said yes you did
[2:22:39] see
[2:22:40] let's go on now immediately after that
[2:22:43] he entered Babylon or went down into
[2:22:45] Sodom never found them so the fire fell
[2:22:48] he found lot and his two daughters and
[2:22:52] said get out of here right now
[2:22:54] the wife originally come out didn't she
[2:22:57] he said see it went out he went down
[2:22:59] there remember he was on his road down
[2:23:01] he sent Messengers before him but he
[2:23:02] went down himself
[2:23:06] right to find out if all this thing was
[2:23:08] so and he found it full of what
[2:23:12] the message to the Doom what'd they do
[2:23:14] laughed at it
[2:23:15] what do they do today the same thing I
[2:23:17] belong to the assemblies I belong to the
[2:23:19] Oneness I've danced in the spirit glory
[2:23:20] to God I speak in you know the rest of
[2:23:22] that
[2:23:24] that's not enough
[2:23:26] all right go ahead I'll cut my hair if I
[2:23:29] want to I'll do this I'll just say this
[2:23:30] I don't have to be baptized in Jesus
[2:23:32] name I don't care what they said Paul's
[2:23:34] an old woman hate her anyhow that's all
[2:23:36] right go ahead that's just like the
[2:23:38] church
[2:23:41] we had messianics come here and try to
[2:23:44] tell us that the writings of Paul
[2:23:45] shouldn't even be included in the
[2:23:46] scripture
[2:23:48] I said why because he put the woman in
[2:23:51] her place
[2:23:53] because he cleaned the church
[2:23:55] because he told the man how they ought
[2:23:57] to be
[2:23:58] one of these days if you hadn't already
[2:24:01] you'll cross that line
[2:24:03] and here is how we know
[2:24:08] you'll never desire no more
[2:24:11] to do what's right
[2:24:18] how do I know brother Shelley that I've
[2:24:21] blasphemed the Holy Spirit you won't
[2:24:23] care
[2:24:26] you won't know
[2:24:29] and you won't care
[2:24:31] if you care
[2:24:33] if there's a measure of concerning you
[2:24:36] for whether or not you've missed it
[2:24:38] you have not
[2:24:40] blasphemed
[2:24:42] when someone commits that unpardonable
[2:24:44] sin they step over the mercy and Grace
[2:24:47] of Jesus Christ and they're sealed
[2:24:51] their consciouses are seared with a hot
[2:24:54] iron they lose their consciousness of
[2:24:57] God and what's right and what matters
[2:25:00] and what counts
[2:25:04] now that ought to help somebody
[2:25:06] [Music]
[2:25:07] he said brother sister do you realize
[2:25:09] what's been said you'll cross that line
[2:25:11] and you'll never want to do it you'll
[2:25:13] never want to run after the truth that's
[2:25:16] why in the very last of the last days
[2:25:18] that the church will be so clean
[2:25:21] because there won't be nobody with them
[2:25:23] but the ones that's that's manifesting
[2:25:25] Christ the one who where the certified
[2:25:28] seed who carry the certified seed the
[2:25:30] rest the the backsliders and the friends
[2:25:32] of the church and those who just come to
[2:25:34] come that they won't be around
[2:25:37] they'll they'll cross the line uh if you
[2:25:40] haven't already you'll never desire no
[2:25:41] more did you hear what I said it's a
[2:25:43] matter brother sister do you realize
[2:25:44] what's been said you'll cross that line
[2:25:46] You'll never want to do it anymore
[2:25:49] you'll still hear the gospel sure but
[2:25:51] you'll never accept it
[2:25:53] you can't accept it but the gospel will
[2:25:56] be preached to the doomed
[2:25:58] those that are eternally lost can't get
[2:26:00] saved no more you're already in that
[2:26:01] spot and don't know it
[2:26:03] you think you're living in pleasure the
[2:26:06] dead while you're alive
[2:26:08] he's preaching about The Walking Dead
[2:26:10] isn't he
[2:26:11] all right let's finish
[2:26:13] is that it
[2:26:14] let's stand
[2:26:23] I want to know I'm ready
[2:26:29] now let me explain this to you in
[2:26:31] closing
[2:26:33] and you that had a good nap I'm glad
[2:26:35] you're awake now
[2:26:37] and I hope you can be concerned about
[2:26:39] your soul
[2:26:43] because it's a pretty serious thing
[2:26:49] you're not getting enough sleep on
[2:26:51] Saturday night I wonder what you're
[2:26:52] doing
[2:26:55] and you might ought to tweak that a
[2:26:57] little bit
[2:27:00] because we didn't bring you here to
[2:27:01] sleep
[2:27:04] we're here to try to help you
[2:27:06] you don't have to say anything
[2:27:11] now you're never going to know
[2:27:14] by looking in the mirror
[2:27:20] whether you're right or not
[2:27:25] because if you go look in the mirror
[2:27:28] you're not going to like what you see
[2:27:33] if you're looking in the mirror of the
[2:27:35] natural
[2:27:36] you'll see every flaw every Freckle ever
[2:27:39] wart ever crooked you know ever stray
[2:27:42] hair
[2:27:46] you'll see how you're I mean I guess
[2:27:48] there are some people that look in the
[2:27:49] mirror and say hey I ain't not good
[2:27:50] looking
[2:27:51] but I don't know too many people like
[2:27:53] that well a few
[2:27:57] most of us look in the mirror and we see
[2:27:59] all the flaws and anything that's wrong
[2:28:01] in the Grand Canyons under the eyes and
[2:28:05] and you can't get encouraged when you
[2:28:07] see what's what's there
[2:28:09] but you've got to remember there's
[2:28:10] another mirror to look in
[2:28:13] there's a mirror of the word
[2:28:15] and the mirror of the word is not
[2:28:17] showing you how ugly you are not as a
[2:28:20] bride the mirror of the word is showing
[2:28:22] you the beauty and Perfection of Jesus
[2:28:24] Christ so when you really look at the
[2:28:27] word you're born again you have had the
[2:28:29] call of God you've surrendered to the
[2:28:31] call you may be cold this morning you
[2:28:34] may be lukewarm you may be indifferent
[2:28:37] but if you should choose today to look
[2:28:39] at the word he will show you his Beauty
[2:28:43] if you should join us around this Altar
[2:28:46] for a moment of worship he will let you
[2:28:48] see his Beauty
[2:28:50] you don't have to concentrate on how far
[2:28:52] how far you fall short
[2:28:55] all you have to do is say I'm unworthy
[2:28:58] but my lamb is Worthy
[2:29:01] I'm not pretty but my sacrifice is I'm
[2:29:04] not perfect but my Jesus is and if I'll
[2:29:08] keep looking to him I will be changed
[2:29:11] into this image
[2:29:13] if you look at your ugliness you'll only
[2:29:16] multiply ugliness but if you focus
[2:29:19] spiritually on his Perfection you'll be
[2:29:22] changed from glory to glory from glory
[2:29:26] to glory to glory so there is therefore
[2:29:29] now I don't care how far we fall there
[2:29:32] is therefore now no condemnation to them
[2:29:35] which are in Christ Jesus all you have
[2:29:37] to do is just choose to renew your
[2:29:39] fellowship with him and you know it's so
[2:29:42] easy to just say Lord I'm wrong
[2:29:45] Lord I'm wrong I'm wrong you're always
[2:29:48] right
[2:29:49] you're always right and I'm I'm a lot of
[2:29:51] time wrong
[2:29:52] will you help me be right
[2:29:55] and he will
[2:29:57] there may be somebody in the church
[2:29:59] pointing fingers at you you know what
[2:30:01] you want not to do that
[2:30:05] I've known quite a few of you a long
[2:30:08] time and I remember when you wasn't so
[2:30:10] perfect
[2:30:13] there's nobody in here that ought to
[2:30:15] have a higher spot to where we could
[2:30:17] really Point our fingers at others and
[2:30:19] say you ain't there
[2:30:20] or remember somebody's past well I don't
[2:30:23] know whether they've repented or not
[2:30:24] that
[2:30:26] is none of your business
[2:30:32] well I know what they did well I know
[2:30:34] what they did well somebody knew what
[2:30:36] you did
[2:30:37] and it didn't prevent you from running
[2:30:39] to the cross
[2:30:42] you see if there's any Judgment at all
[2:30:44] it comes from the word
[2:30:46] and it comes from this desk because this
[2:30:48] was ordained by God
[2:30:51] to set the standard of righteousness
[2:30:54] from the word for his body not this body
[2:30:57] his body
[2:30:59] it's not to come from one another we're
[2:31:01] not supposed to be pointing our fingers
[2:31:03] at one another looking for the flaw
[2:31:04] they're there anybody in here got some
[2:31:08] I sincerely thought it
[2:31:10] but I was sincerely wrong
[2:31:12] just get up there and lead us in worship
[2:31:14] and quit
[2:31:18] [Music]

[2:38:36] at times
[2:38:38] and it hurt him
[2:38:40] he saw me at times and it hurt him but
[2:38:44] he never loved me less
[2:38:48] if it's possible he loved me more
[2:38:52] why would you say such a thing as that
[2:38:54] because he went after me
[2:38:57] he pulled me he drew me he loved me
[2:39:01] if you stand here today and you feel
[2:39:04] your failures

[2:39:08] if you feel
[2:39:10] out of joint or out of communion with
[2:39:14] him
[2:39:15] all you have to do is just stretch your
[2:39:17] heart toward him
[2:39:18] I think we could all do it and then
[2:39:20] nobody's embarrassed
[2:39:22] why don't we just stretch our hands like
[2:39:24] this to him Lord here we are
[2:39:26] we're very flawed
[2:39:29] we're very flawed
[2:39:31] we've come from dysfunction
[2:39:34] you've called us to Super function
[2:39:37] but we've come from dysfunction
[2:39:39] we've come from Brokenness
[2:39:42] we were we were raised by Broken People
[2:39:47] we've carried some of their traits
[2:39:49] forward
[2:39:50] if it were not for the blood if it were
[2:39:52] not for your delivering power
[2:39:55] we would just be doomed to repeat the
[2:39:57] past but today we are not doing such
[2:40:01] we confess before you our great need of
[2:40:04] you
[2:40:05] and our desire to walk in the fullness
[2:40:07] of your word
[2:40:08] would you correct our hearts right now
[2:40:11] by the Holy Spirit would you tune us
[2:40:14] would you tune us like an instrument
[2:40:18] would you shape us like Clay on The
[2:40:21] Potter's Wheel
[2:40:23] would you help us to know and to do your
[2:40:26] perfect will
[2:40:28] this is our desire Lord Jesus thank you
[2:40:32] for your blood
[2:40:34] thank you for your sacrifice and thank
[2:40:36] you for letting me see it
[2:40:39] Lord thank you for letting me see my
[2:40:41] part
[2:40:42] in your great love
[2:40:44] and in your economy
[2:40:47] I'm going to wait to do our prayer over
[2:40:50] the father specifically when we when we
[2:40:52] come back
[2:40:54] but would you all just raise your hand
[2:40:56] toward these men of God young and old
[2:40:58] married and unmarried but would you
[2:41:01] sisters just raise your hand toward all
[2:41:04] of them right now and let's just ask
[2:41:06] that God would strengthen them in this
[2:41:10] wicked hour
[2:41:12] Lord in this wicked day
[2:41:15] we need men like this
[2:41:17] we need Men of Integrity to lead us in
[2:41:22] the faith
[2:41:23] we need men like these standing here
[2:41:26] right now some are natural fathers
[2:41:31] others are not
[2:41:34] some are older some are younger
[2:41:38] even some are barely teens
[2:41:42] but we ask right now that you will
[2:41:45] strengthen them mold them shape them
[2:41:49] into Men of Integrity
[2:41:51] may they raise up in the fullness
[2:41:54] of the measure of Christ
[2:41:57] to be what you have called us to be
[2:42:00] especially Lord for the daddies we pray
[2:42:03] now let them be examples of your great
[2:42:06] grace
[2:42:08] and Lord if we are not ashamed to come
[2:42:11] to you and say I'm sorry I messed up
[2:42:14] May none of these fathers ever be
[2:42:17] embarrassed or ashamed to come back to
[2:42:20] the family and say I messed up
[2:42:22] I need your forgiveness
[2:42:25] I didn't handle that properly Lord help
[2:42:28] every one of us to remain humble before
[2:42:30] you so that we can confess to our own
[2:42:33] families I didn't handle that just right
[2:42:35] I'm going to try again
[2:42:38] May every daddy be specifically and
[2:42:41] particularly blessed today in the name
[2:42:44] of Jesus Christ and those watching this
[2:42:46] service lead us in one more
[2:42:49] before I spoke a word
[2:42:52] [Music]
[2:43:00] you have been so so good to
[2:43:06] me
[2:43:08] [Music]
[2:43:10] before I took a breath
[2:43:13] you breathe your life in me
[2:43:18] [Music]
[2:43:20] and you have been so so good
[2:43:29] enjoy the
[2:43:32] overwhelming
