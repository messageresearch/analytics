[0:43] you the hope award
[0:45] [Music]
[1:00] hello there I'm Pastor Steven Shelley of
[1:03] New Hope revival ministries in Smith
[1:06] Station Alabama and I'm coming to you
[1:09] again this week in partnership with the
[1:12] gospel channel I'm just thrilled to have
[1:15] another opportunity to come and to bring
[1:18] you greetings in the name of the Lord
[1:20] Jesus Christ and to give you a lesson
[1:23] today from the Word of God I want to
[1:27] thank each and every one of you for
[1:29] writing us and for calling the prayer
[1:32] line I just wanted to show you this
[1:35] stack of prayer requests this is a stack
[1:39] that has come in already this month and
[1:42] we're just a really a few days not even
[1:46] two weeks yet into the first month and
[1:49] all of these prayer requests have come
[1:53] in and a few of these are testimonies
[1:55] which lets me know that God is answering
[1:59] prayer and so I'm adding these to the
[2:02] folder and lately and our services in
[2:06] Alabama we've been lifting these prayer
[2:09] requests lifting this folder up before
[2:11] the Lord and we are continuing to agree
[2:15] and some of you some of these requests
[2:18] came in weeks ago but we're holding on
[2:20] to them I don't want to just say well
[2:24] we've prayed a time or two and we'll
[2:25] toss them out no I want to keep bringing
[2:28] them before the Lord and believing that
[2:31] God is going to meet your need and just
[2:34] as I was sitting here before we started
[2:36] recording I read a prayer request and a
[2:40] testimony from a dear sister in the
[2:42] United Kingdom who said she was walking
[2:45] down the street of her neighborhood and
[2:47] someone asked her have you seen the
[2:50] latest broadcast with Pastor Steven and
[2:53] you know that encouraged me it blessed
[2:56] me to know that neighbor is sharing with
[2:59] neighbor
[3:00] and her testimony was that they loved me
[3:04] in the UK well
[3:06] that means something to me because I
[3:08] also love the people of the UK and I
[3:13] don't remember right now the first time
[3:15] I went to the United Kingdom exactly
[3:18] what year it was but it's been quite a
[3:22] few years ago now over 20 years and the
[3:26] first time I ever win and I've been
[3:28] quite a few times and we have had some
[3:31] wonderful meetings in the UK in both in
[3:34] churches and in conferences and even in
[3:38] hotel rooms and you know I'd like to
[3:40] come back I would like to come back and
[3:42] have services with some of you who watch
[3:45] this program so faithfully so you pray
[3:48] and I'll pray with you and as the Lord
[3:51] opens the door and leads we'll come and
[3:54] have a meeting together it would be a
[3:56] real honor to be able to shake your hand
[3:59] and to meet you personally I am just so
[4:03] thankful for the gospel channel and it's
[4:06] outreaches and what God is accomplishing
[4:09] in people's lives I think if you've been
[4:12] watching the programme over the course
[4:16] of the last couple of months we have
[4:19] been doing a series that we called
[4:22] schemes and devices now I believe there
[4:25] were 11 episodes in that series and I
[4:29] mentioned to you the last time in
[4:32] episode 11 that we were praying about
[4:37] continuing the thought taking it in in a
[4:41] slightly different direction and I've
[4:43] really prayed about whether or not the
[4:45] Lord would have me to kind of get into
[4:48] some of these things and I feel his
[4:50] liberty and his leadership to do so and
[4:54] so I'm praying today that God will use
[4:58] these words this teaching this lesson to
[5:03] become a key to unlock some things in
[5:06] your life to give you some strategy for
[5:10] both
[5:11] some strategy also for repentance and I
[5:16] truly believe that God wants to help us
[5:21] win the daily battle that we fight as
[5:24] children of God we studied as I said a
[5:28] moment ago 11 episodes of schemes and
[5:33] devices and our theme Scripture I'm
[5:37] gonna carry that scripture over and I'm
[5:40] going to call the next few times that we
[5:44] are together
[5:44] demonic doorways and we're going to
[5:48] discuss some of the most common doorways
[5:51] that the enemy seems to be able to use
[5:55] to approach us in our life some again
[6:00] it's schemes and devices but
[6:03] specifically demonic doorways I'm gonna
[6:07] carry our theme scripture over into this
[6:10] new series 2nd Corinthians chapter 2 and
[6:14] verse 11 lest Satan should get an
[6:18] advantage of us for we are not ignorant
[6:23] of his devices and it's been many weeks
[6:29] ago that we started studying using that
[6:32] scripture as our foundation and in that
[6:36] first episode I believe it was I
[6:39] mentioned a quote from Corrie ten Boom
[6:43] where she said it's a poor soldier
[6:47] indeed who does not recognize the enemy
[6:52] how important it is for us to recognize
[6:56] our enemy one thing most of us have
[7:00] learned on our Christian journey is that
[7:03] Satan hates exposure and he will go to
[7:06] extreme measures to remain hidden well
[7:10] we're calling him out of his hiding
[7:13] place
[7:13] yes we're turning the light of God's
[7:16] Word on him and we're exposing all of
[7:20] those
[7:21] crevices and corners those little nooks
[7:25] and crannies that he likes to hide in he
[7:29] feels like that he will be undetected
[7:32] but you know I believe according to the
[7:35] Word of God we must learn his devices we
[7:39] must learn his way so that we will not
[7:42] be taken by surprise are caught off
[7:45] guard so I want us to look today to the
[7:49] Old Testament if you will
[7:52] lamentations chapter five and verse
[7:55] seven our fathers have sinned and are
[8:00] not and we have borne their iniquities
[8:05] now this is an interesting portion of
[8:09] Scripture and it is a scripture that
[8:13] introduces a theme of how we might bear
[8:18] the iniquity of our forefathers what
[8:23] kind of an impact what kind of an
[8:26] influence does the life of our parents
[8:29] and our grandparents and our
[8:32] great-grandparents have on our lives
[8:35] today well when I start looking at this
[8:40] subject there is a word that is commonly
[8:44] used in charismatic and Pentecostal
[8:47] circles you'll often hear people speak
[8:51] of generational curses and I know that
[8:56] there are people who argue on both sides
[8:59] of this subject there are many who are
[9:02] fully persuaded that there is something
[9:07] called a generational curse that can
[9:11] affect us and if we don't deal with that
[9:15] issue it will affect our children and
[9:17] grandchildren and then there are other
[9:20] people who say that when we come to
[9:23] Jesus every curse against us is
[9:26] automatically broken and
[9:29] we automatically receive total
[9:31] deliverance of any influence or any
[9:36] residual effect from the life of our
[9:39] forefathers I want you to know that I
[9:43] believe the scripture is actually
[9:45] somewhere in the middle and I want to
[9:49] talk to you about that and we may use
[9:51] the term generational curses because I
[9:54] think that is a term that we can come to
[9:57] understand and let me give you just a
[9:59] very simple definition of what a
[10:02] generational curse is a generational
[10:06] curse is basically a defilement that was
[10:10] passed down from one generation to
[10:13] another I think that is a very good
[10:16] definition for you to hold on to a
[10:19] defilement that was passed down from one
[10:23] generation to another now if you
[10:26] completely oppose that idea you would
[10:30] have to ignore a scripture in Psalm 51
[10:33] and five that we're very familiar with
[10:37] where the psalmist said behold I was
[10:41] shapen in iniquity and in sin did my
[10:46] mother conceive me the psalmist is
[10:50] talking about from the innocence of the
[10:53] womb I was born with a sinful nature and
[10:59] I was born under the influence of
[11:03] iniquity now he doesn't particularly say
[11:09] that it was the sins of his parents but
[11:12] he did say in sin in a fallen nature my
[11:18] mother did conceive me and so I believe
[11:23] it's important for us to look at this
[11:27] subject I believe that there are many
[11:30] people perhaps watching this program
[11:32] today who have never prayed a prayer of
[11:36] repentance
[11:38] Debray
[11:39] what I like to call a generational cycle
[11:43] it is certainly a curse because it's
[11:47] something that perhaps we did nothing to
[11:50] to inherit it we didn't necessarily
[11:53] choose it for ourselves but we carry a
[11:58] predisposition to a certain behavior to
[12:03] a certain addiction and we're going to
[12:05] talk about that just in just a few
[12:08] moments and so I like to look at it as a
[12:12] generational cycle or a generational
[12:16] pattern and what we mean by that is
[12:20] watching a behavior passed down from
[12:24] generation to generation to generation
[12:27] even brain science is telling us now
[12:31] that this is not only a spiritual
[12:35] concept but a very natural concept and I
[12:39] think everyone watching the program
[12:42] today would agree that we are certainly
[12:46] products of our DNA of our genetics and
[12:50] we are also products of our environment
[12:54] and so everything about our environment
[12:58] is not negative surely there are also
[13:02] positive things in our life when we seem
[13:06] to have had more negative things going
[13:08] on than positive things then of course
[13:11] we talk more about the negative but but
[13:14] in all of our lives as children of God
[13:18] he has been watching carefully over us
[13:22] even when we were not completely
[13:25] surrendered to him and even when we were
[13:28] not aware of his great love and his
[13:31] great care his great concern for us
[13:34] because I believe according to the New
[13:37] Testament before I was ever born before
[13:40] I was ever formed in my mother's womb
[13:42] God my Creator knew me I believe as the
[13:48] scripture says all of my days
[13:51] were written in his book before I was
[13:55] ever born I believe that God knew my
[13:58] life
[13:59] he knew my my makeup my physical makeup
[14:04] and I believe that God knew my choices I
[14:07] also believe that in his foreknowledge
[14:12] he knew ultimately whether or not I
[14:15] would choose to serve Him to live for
[14:19] him to surrender my life to him and I
[14:23] believe that by his foreknowledge of my
[14:26] life before I was ever born
[14:29] he developed a plan and a destiny for me
[14:33] unfortunately all of the things that
[14:36] have happened in my life are not good
[14:39] but as I have told you before they were
[14:42] for my good the scripture promises that
[14:46] all things work together for the good of
[14:50] them who love the Lord and to them who
[14:54] are the called according to his purpose
[14:57] and I believe that many of you watching
[15:01] this program right now are the called
[15:04] according to the purposes and promises
[15:08] of God and I believe that all of us
[15:11] could look back over our life and say
[15:13] that we certainly have borne the
[15:16] influence of our environment many of us
[15:20] grew up in a very loving home where
[15:23] there was both a loving mother and a
[15:25] loving father and a warm inviting
[15:29] nourishing environment every day of our
[15:33] childhood others of us grew up with
[15:35] different circumstances in my particular
[15:38] home my parents divorced when I was five
[15:41] years old and I was raised by my mother
[15:44] alone and with the help and the love and
[15:48] the support of my grandparents with my
[15:51] father being completely absent from my
[15:54] life and so there were there were
[15:58] effects there there were things that I
[16:01] carry in my life I look
[16:04] things differently perhaps because of my
[16:07] background what I'm more concerned about
[16:10] today is how the life choices of my
[16:15] parents and grandparents may affect me
[16:18] in my spiritual life and how the enemy
[16:22] seems to take advantage of this kind of
[16:27] a generational cycle some of it is
[16:31] psychological but some of it is also
[16:34] very spiritual and we have authority
[16:38] over those things which are spiritual
[16:42] and we also can believe for healing and
[16:46] deliverance for the aspect of a
[16:50] generational cycle that is psychological
[16:53] I believe that God wants to make us
[16:56] whole wh o L e I believe that he wants
[17:02] to preserve us and give us wholeness and
[17:05] health in our spirit in our soul and in
[17:10] our body and I do not believe that we
[17:13] are ultimately long-term cursed by the
[17:18] sins the iniquities the choices and
[17:22] behaviors of our parents but I do
[17:25] believe that we have a responsibility as
[17:28] spirit filled believers to break the
[17:32] cycle to stop the cycle and we do that
[17:37] by the power of the Cross every curse is
[17:43] dealt with by the precious blood of
[17:46] Jesus Christ that was shed for you and I
[17:50] on the cross of Calvary I believe that
[17:53] with everything that I am let's look at
[17:57] a few Old Testament Scriptures that
[17:59] speak of how the iniquity is carried
[18:04] forward from generation to generation in
[18:08] Exodus chapter 34 verses 6 and 7 and the
[18:13] Lord passed by before him and pro
[18:17] claimed the Lord the Lord God merciful
[18:21] and gracious long-suffering and abundant
[18:24] in goodness and truth keeping mercy for
[18:29] thousands forgiving iniquity and
[18:32] transgression and sin and that will by
[18:36] no means clear the guilty visiting the
[18:40] iniquity of the father's upon the
[18:43] children and upon the children's
[18:45] children unto the third and to the
[18:49] fourth generation I believe this
[18:52] scripture is clear the influence the
[18:57] effects of our fathers and grandfathers
[19:02] and great-grandfather's the decisions
[19:05] that they made certainly caused us to be
[19:11] influenced and to be affected there's no
[19:14] doubt in my mind Leviticus chapter 26
[19:18] and verse 38 and 39 and you shall perish
[19:23] among the heathen and the land of your
[19:25] enemies shall eat you up and they that
[19:28] are left of you shall pine away in their
[19:30] iniquity in your enemies lands and also
[19:35] in the iniquities of their fathers shall
[19:38] they pine away with them now why would
[19:41] we have these two very strong verses
[19:46] portions of scripture about the iniquity
[19:50] of the fathers being carried on to
[19:52] another generation because God was
[19:55] dealing with the rebellion in the hearts
[19:59] of his own children we're talking about
[20:01] the children of Israel we're talking
[20:04] about the peculiar treasure of the Lord
[20:07] he chose the Israelites he chose the
[20:12] seed of Abraham and he chose that family
[20:17] line
[20:18] in fact his desire was that through the
[20:21] seed of Abraham the entire world and all
[20:24] the nations of the world would be
[20:27] blessed he loved them he
[20:30] provided for them he even provided for
[20:34] their sins for their iniquities he was
[20:37] so meticulous and careful to bring down
[20:42] a set of instructions with again minut
[20:49] details how to cover how to deal with
[20:53] how to make an offering for how to offer
[20:56] an atonement for even the smallest
[21:00] infraction against the instruction and
[21:04] the will of God for the lives of his
[21:07] children and yet as easy as God made it
[21:11] we read in the Bible there was constant
[21:15] rebellion in their heart and no matter
[21:19] how the Lord covered how he provided a
[21:23] way of escape it seems that they
[21:28] continuously generation after generation
[21:32] hardened their heart hardened their
[21:35] heart disregarding God's instruction
[21:39] totally rebelling against the way that
[21:43] God had established for them and because
[21:47] of this rebellion one generation would
[21:51] would create an atmosphere of anger an
[21:55] atmosphere of rejecting God's Way an
[21:59] atmosphere of sin and rebellion and of
[22:02] course the influence of that the
[22:06] teaching of that the example that one
[22:09] generation would set would certainly
[22:13] encompass the next generation and the
[22:16] next generation and the next generation
[22:19] and so God was actually giving the
[22:22] children of Israel an opportunity to the
[22:25] third and the fourth generation to come
[22:28] back to him to repent of their sins and
[22:33] the sins of the generations before to
[22:37] once and for all break the generational
[22:41] curse
[22:42] break the generational cycle and set the
[22:46] next generation free once and for all
[22:50] I don't know if that makes any sense to
[22:52] you or not but when I read these verses
[22:55] of Scripture I want to understand what
[22:58] it is that God was accomplishing by
[23:02] visiting the sins of one generation on
[23:06] another generation I know enough about
[23:08] the nature of God and the character of
[23:11] God as revealed by the word to know that
[23:15] God is a God of justice of equity of
[23:20] righteousness and in no way would God
[23:24] want to visit another generation in an
[23:27] unfair unjust way but he created this
[23:34] cycle that we read about in these verses
[23:37] of Scripture for for mercy's sake to
[23:41] give that generation an opportunity to
[23:44] just come clean before him and say we
[23:47] have followed in the ways of our fathers
[23:49] and for that we humbly repent we repent
[23:53] for our sins we repent for the sins of
[23:56] the generations before us and we align
[24:00] our hearts hear me we align our hearts
[24:04] with the ways that you have set aside
[24:07] for us and we align our hearts with the
[24:12] instructions that you have given us in
[24:16] your word and and Lord Oh father God let
[24:22] this cycle of generational iniquity be
[24:27] broken let this cycle of generation
[24:30] curse be broken that it not be visited
[24:34] upon my children and upon my
[24:36] grandchildren may they not have to pay
[24:40] in any way may they not be influenced
[24:43] may they not have a predisposition
[24:46] toward any of the things that have
[24:50] become cycles in my generation and the
[24:55] generations before me does that help you
[24:57] at all can you understand that this was
[25:00] not a judgment of God this visiting of
[25:05] the iniquity on another generation was
[25:08] actually a merciful act it was God
[25:12] saying not only can you repent for the
[25:15] sins of your generation but you can
[25:17] break the influence you can break the
[25:20] cycle and the pattern of the past few
[25:24] generations so that truly the generation
[25:28] that follows they can come with a clean
[25:32] slate they don't have to start off in
[25:36] the in the same vulnerability
[25:45] and verse 18 the Lord is long-suffering
[25:49] and of great mercy here's what you've
[25:53] got to know about God he is
[25:56] long-suffering full of mercy great mercy
[26:01] the the writer said forgiving iniquity
[26:05] and transgression and by no means
[26:10] clearing the guilty visiting the
[26:13] iniquity of the father's upon the
[26:16] children unto the third and fourth
[26:20] generation so we see this repeating what
[26:25] has already been said for us in the book
[26:28] of Exodus now let's move on just a
[26:31] moment I think as we mentioned just a
[26:34] moment ago we inherit traits we inherit
[26:38] preferences from our parents and all of
[26:43] these traits and preferences are not
[26:46] particularly positive and the influence
[26:49] of those traits and preferences not only
[26:53] affect us our lives but they often
[26:56] affect the lives of those closest to us
[26:59] especially our blood relatives but I
[27:03] want you to know that it's not just my
[27:06] blood family that's related
[27:09] to me by blood that can also bear some
[27:13] of the effect of cycles and patterns
[27:17] that are going on in my life from
[27:20] generations before but also those around
[27:23] me because it has a way of bending us in
[27:27] a certain direction I don't know about
[27:30] you but I don't want to be bent toward
[27:33] anything but God's standard of truth I
[27:37] don't want to be trying to figure out
[27:40] how to justify my unbelief I don't want
[27:43] to spend my life trying to justify my
[27:46] bad choices and I don't even want to use
[27:49] my parents and grandparents and
[27:52] great-grandparents as an excuse for
[27:55] making the same bad choices that they
[27:57] made I want to be bent toward God's Word
[28:02] I want to lean with everything that I am
[28:06] toward the truth that God has
[28:09] established for my life and for my
[28:12] children and if he tarries my children's
[28:15] children when we acquire a sinful habit
[28:20] or a belief that negatively affects our
[28:24] life or those around us this could be
[28:27] defined as a generational curse or a
[28:31] generational cycle I'm going to read
[28:34] that note again when we acquire a sinful
[28:39] habit or a belief that negatively
[28:42] affects our lives are those around us
[28:45] this is known as a generational curse or
[28:49] a generational cycle and again this can
[28:54] be brought upon us by the influenced by
[28:59] the atmosphere of being around our loved
[29:02] ones but I believe that it can also be a
[29:06] trick of the enemy to try to put this on
[29:09] our lives in a demonic way I believe
[29:13] that there are evil spirits who would
[29:16] like to take the the effects of what has
[29:21] gone
[29:21] in our previous generations and I
[29:25] believe they're demons that would like
[29:26] to attach themselves to our lives
[29:29] to force us into the same pattern and
[29:33] into the same cycle and you know what we
[29:36] say no we say no we say even if alcohol
[29:42] has been a predominant spirit in in our
[29:47] prior generations father grandfather
[29:50] great-grandfather I say no I say no to
[29:55] to the influence of a spirit that would
[29:58] desire to cause me to be addicted to
[30:01] alcohol I say a big no I think you need
[30:05] to say a big no and I'm gonna say even a
[30:08] bigger no to my children and to my
[30:12] children's children this has to stop and
[30:16] so I want to make sure you are following
[30:20] me closely I believe that we pick up
[30:24] some of these things in a very natural
[30:27] way the influence the effect if we grow
[30:32] up in a home where our father came in
[30:36] from work and he drowned his stress with
[30:41] alcohol then as you see that over and
[30:45] over and over again it it becomes very
[30:50] common to you you expect that when Dad
[30:53] walks through that door if I don't know
[30:56] what I guess I guess also in the UK I
[30:59] was gonna say here in America it would
[31:02] be quite common that Dad would walk in
[31:04] the door and go to the refrigerator and
[31:07] pull out a six-pack of beer and drink it
[31:10] all until his stress is gone or it may
[31:13] be as it used to be in the UK come in
[31:17] and put his things down maybe and and
[31:20] walk down the street to the corner pub
[31:23] and and and drink a few pints and and
[31:26] forget about is sorrow and as we grow up
[31:29] watching that happen
[31:31] this this becomes like a signboard in
[31:35] our brain that says when you get
[31:38] stressed when you get tired that is the
[31:41] way you handle it
[31:43] and so that behavior gets repeated from
[31:46] generation to generation because of
[31:49] influence and atmosphere but I'm also
[31:52] saying and this is what I want you to be
[31:55] very aware of if you and I are able to
[31:59] recognize that about our own family
[32:01] history if we are sometimes able to
[32:05] recognize behaviors in our own life that
[32:09] remind us tremendously of our mother or
[32:12] of our father or of one of our
[32:14] grandparents if we can recognize that so
[32:17] can the enemy of our spirit so can the
[32:21] enemy of God and so what he will do is
[32:24] take great advantage of what we have
[32:28] already recognized in our family history
[32:31] and I believe that he will assign demon
[32:34] spirits
[32:35] to do everything within their realm of
[32:38] power within their sphere of power to
[32:41] make sure that you get locked into what
[32:46] we could call a generational curse or a
[32:49] generational cycle
[32:51] I believe those demon spirits then can
[32:55] manipulate circumstances in our lives
[32:58] and really there are many many ways that
[33:03] they can help ensure that you and I are
[33:08] going to look to the pub look to the to
[33:13] the beer to the alcohol to the drugs to
[33:17] the to the sex whatever it is as we have
[33:21] seen modeled before they're going to do
[33:25] everything they can to lock us into that
[33:28] kind of a cycle and we will carry on
[33:31] that same behavior sometimes almost
[33:34] automatically really just making the
[33:37] same choice you know we think we're just
[33:40] following along with life not even
[33:42] realizing that they're demon
[33:44] spirits that have been assigned against
[33:46] us to put us in that prison of addiction
[33:50] and how did they know that we would even
[33:53] be vulnerable to such a thing how did
[33:55] they even know that we would even be
[33:57] tempted by such a thing because they are
[34:00] aware of our generational heritage
[34:03] they're aware of how our parents handled
[34:07] things our grandparents and our
[34:09] great-grandparents so see there are many
[34:10] different aspects of how this
[34:13] generational pattern or generational
[34:17] cycle can form I want you to know it
[34:19] enough about it understand enough about
[34:22] it so that you can break its hold and so
[34:26] that you can scatter those demon spirits
[34:28] perhaps that have been a sign to lock
[34:32] you in listen I've got some hang-ups in
[34:36] my life I have recognized some hang-ups
[34:39] along the way but but the heart of every
[34:43] parent especially those who love God is
[34:47] to shield the next generation shield our
[34:51] children if if say for instance I were
[34:55] to have a way of of relieving stress
[34:58] that was not a godly way I wouldn't want
[35:02] to pass that on to my children I would
[35:06] want them to be free from that I would
[35:08] want them to learn that there's a
[35:10] biblical way to deal with anxiety and
[35:13] stress yes there's a Bible way and that
[35:19] is by meditating on the Word of God
[35:21] that's by drawing yourself close up to
[35:25] Jesus and leaning on him and loving on
[35:29] him and giving him your hearts devotion
[35:33] and giving him praise and celebrating
[35:36] the past victories of your life there's
[35:39] a biblical way to hide in him until the
[35:43] storm passes by but if my children see
[35:47] me running to something that is not
[35:49] godly and not healthy then
[35:52] when they face similar circumstances of
[35:55] stress they could very easily pick up
[35:59] the same thing that they have seen
[36:02] modeled before them it would be harder
[36:05] for them to make a better decision
[36:08] because of those spirits that I
[36:11] recognize are assigned to that next
[36:15] generation to make sure that that cycle
[36:19] continues I tell you the devil is slick
[36:22] and he is sly but he is defeated in the
[36:27] name of the Lord Jesus Christ because
[36:29] we're uncovering him in your family by
[36:33] the Word of God in Deuteronomy chapter 5
[36:38] and verse 9 this is talking a little bit
[36:43] about a cultic practices and idolatry if
[36:46] you should read ahead in verse 9 thou
[36:50] shalt not bow down thyself unto them nor
[36:54] serve them for I the LORD thy God am a
[36:58] jealous God visiting the iniquity of the
[37:01] father's upon the children unto the
[37:04] third and fourth generation listen at
[37:07] this phrase of them that hate me of them
[37:14] that hate me I'm going to read it again
[37:17] because I think this is an important
[37:20] phrase to help us interpret all of the
[37:23] other scriptures that we've read and at
[37:26] least a dozen more that we're not going
[37:28] to read today but that also mentioned
[37:31] this concept of perhaps the father's
[37:34] eating sour grapes and the children's
[37:36] teeth being set on edge are visiting the
[37:40] iniquity down to the third and fourth
[37:42] generation but listen at this verse
[37:44] because it helps us gain perspective of
[37:47] the other verses thou shall not bow down
[37:49] thyself unto them nor serve them for I
[37:53] the LORD thy God am a jealous God
[37:55] visiting the iniquity of the father's
[37:58] upon the children unto the third and the
[38:01] fourth generation of them that
[38:04] hate me this what what this helps me to
[38:09] see is that this is a cycle that just
[38:12] continues among those who disregard the
[38:17] Lord he said hate me and and you know
[38:21] it's easier to hate God than what a lot
[38:24] of people are willing to see it's
[38:26] actually easier to hate God what do you
[38:30] mean by that brother Shelley well I mean
[38:32] the Bible said if you love me Jesus is
[38:37] saying God is saying to us if you love
[38:39] me you will keep my Commandments and if
[38:43] you say you love me and you keep not my
[38:46] Commandments you lie this is the Word of
[38:49] God you lie and the truth is not in you
[38:52] so it's really easier to hate God than
[38:56] what we realize because when we choose
[38:58] to disobey the Word of God
[39:01] we're hating God this is what the
[39:03] scripture defines as a hatred toward God
[39:07] so don't don't say I love him don't say
[39:11] I love the Lord and and not pursue truth
[39:18] make up your mind that if you indeed
[39:21] love him you're going to push with
[39:24] everything you've got toward living a
[39:27] life that would glorify the Lord I want
[39:31] to say something to you that I say all
[39:32] the time and that is sometimes people
[39:36] will say oh you know when I read the
[39:39] Bible God requires so much I just don't
[39:44] know how I can live under that heavy
[39:45] burden but what you fail to understand
[39:48] my friend is that everything that God
[39:52] requires of us everything that God asks
[39:57] of us he provides he gives us grace to
[40:03] be obedient he shows us mercy when we
[40:07] fail to be obedient he tells us do not
[40:11] sin and yet he say
[40:13] if you sin you have an advocate with the
[40:17] father you know I sometimes say this is
[40:21] rigged I sometimes say God has rigged
[40:25] this it's it's fixed because everything
[40:29] that he asked us to do he provides
[40:32] everything we need to measure up if we
[40:37] will learn to trust him and not
[40:40] ourselves and not our works so in this
[40:45] particular scripture this sin this
[40:48] iniquity is continued to be visited upon
[40:52] the third and the fourth generation of
[40:55] them that hate me and I I would say that
[40:59] it just starts over after the fourth
[41:03] generation in an unbelieving family it
[41:06] just starts over and continues and
[41:08] continues and continues another for
[41:10] generations and other for generations
[41:13] etc but if there is a generation that
[41:17] decides no more no more I'm going to
[41:23] stop this cycle I'm gonna find a way to
[41:26] break this addiction this generational
[41:30] curse this generational cycle or pattern
[41:33] I'm not going to live under the same
[41:36] kind of burden that my father lived
[41:38] under my grandfather it stops here too
[41:44] many times we use these things as
[41:46] excuses it's all I've known it's all
[41:50] I've ever seen it's the only influence
[41:52] I've ever had you can't do that it can't
[41:55] become a crutch it can't become an
[41:58] excuse for bad behavior and making bad
[42:01] choices what you've got to do is come to
[42:04] God come to the Lord lay it before him
[42:08] Oh father I see I see that I am
[42:13] following in my father's footsteps away
[42:16] from you and he followed in his father's
[42:21] footsteps and my children will follow in
[42:25] my footsteps but I
[42:27] see thank God I recognize that I can
[42:32] make the difference with true repentance
[42:35] I can break this cycle you see in
[42:40] reality we're not inheriting the sins of
[42:44] our parents but the defilement that
[42:48] their sins have produced in the family
[42:52] the defilement it's the it's the
[42:56] influence
[42:57] it's that defiling factor that passes
[43:01] down and down and down and down until
[43:05] somebody rises up in true repentance and
[43:08] breaks the cycle a generational curse is
[43:12] passed down from one generation to
[43:14] another generation because of rebellion
[43:17] remember the verse said to the third and
[43:21] fourth generation of them that hate me
[43:23] of them that continue to walk in
[43:26] rebellion against my way and against my
[43:30] word it's very true my friend that the
[43:35] the choices and the unconfessed sins of
[43:39] our fathers and mothers before us can
[43:42] leave us with a predisposition to
[43:46] certain behaviors to certain addictions
[43:50] a particular vulnerability can come upon
[43:54] our lives because of what our parents
[43:58] did before us and they never confessed
[44:01] and perhaps never repented and the cycle
[44:05] was never broken I don't know if the
[44:08] word predisposition is a word that
[44:10] you're familiar with so before I came
[44:13] out here today I I grabbed a definition
[44:17] and it was from from the Webster
[44:21] dictionary predisposition means to have
[44:25] a liability or a tendency or a weakness
[44:29] towards certain things and I hope when
[44:33] you hear that definition at least your
[44:36] mind is going to some examples
[44:39] that you have observed haven't you ever
[44:42] observed a family where the same cycle
[44:46] just repeated itself and repeated itself
[44:50] and you were watching it from afar
[44:52] perhaps it was easier for you to
[44:55] recognize the generational pattern and
[44:57] cycle in another family than what was
[44:59] even going on in your own family we've
[45:02] seen that something like divorce
[45:04] something like broken marriages even can
[45:07] be passed down from generation to
[45:09] generation until someone recognized it
[45:12] and repents for the breaking of the vow
[45:14] and repents for our fathers who broke
[45:17] the vow and we make up our minds we're
[45:20] going to live by God's order and by
[45:23] God's Word and we're going to cover our
[45:26] children and their marriage and our
[45:28] grandchildren and their marriage and so
[45:32] let me go on with this definition it
[45:36] means to have a liability or a tendency
[45:39] or a weakness towards certain things it
[45:41] means to be susceptible to suffer from a
[45:44] particular condition or to hold a
[45:47] particular attitude or to act in a
[45:49] certain way and this is the definition
[45:53] of a predisposition and I want to give
[45:56] you a common example that I use sometime
[45:59] and that is you take a mother who has
[46:02] had some sort of scare around the water
[46:06] maybe a boat capsized or maybe a loved
[46:09] one drowned and this woman has developed
[46:13] this real phobia real fear of not only
[46:18] being in the water but even being near
[46:21] the water and maybe she has all kinds of
[46:25] symptoms you know I've seen people that
[46:27] afraid of the water and their palms
[46:30] would get clammy and they would break
[46:32] out in a sweat and the color would drain
[46:34] from their face I mean this was a
[46:36] legitimate concern legitimate fear of
[46:40] phobia and here's the thing that mother
[46:44] so easily transfers that fear to her
[46:49] child so is a
[46:52] and sometimes the mother makes up her
[46:56] mind you know I'm not going to let my
[46:59] children get near the water I'm not
[47:01] going to let him and so the next thing
[47:03] you know the little children are afraid
[47:05] of the water until finally somebody says
[47:09] wait a minute I don't want much this has
[47:11] been a torment in my life I was never
[47:14] able to go swimming I was never able to
[47:17] have fellowship around the water because
[47:19] I was so afraid of water and maybe that
[47:23] woman might say and so was my mother
[47:25] before me but but wait a minute I don't
[47:28] want to see my my daughter or my son
[47:31] live with a fear that is unfounded
[47:35] because maybe you had a reason to allow
[47:39] that fear to come in maybe you nearly
[47:41] drowned maybe you had a friend in school
[47:43] who drowned
[47:44] maybe you had a as I said fell out of a
[47:47] boat or something but but your child
[47:49] that next generation they perhaps had no
[47:53] reason and and yet you can see that fear
[47:56] finally a mother recognizes wait a
[48:00] minute I'm projecting that fear I'm
[48:03] actually creating a predisposition in my
[48:06] children to be afraid of water
[48:08] and finally that that woman says wait a
[48:11] minute I'm not gonna do that to my
[48:12] children I don't know if I can get rid
[48:15] of this thing for myself I'm sure I'd
[48:17] sure like to beat it but I don't want
[48:19] them to be affected by it so I'm gonna
[48:22] do something about it I'm gonna enroll
[48:24] them in a swimming class I'm gonna do
[48:27] something to ensure that they are not
[48:30] afraid of the water and and that cycle
[48:34] is broken I don't know if that would be
[48:38] considered a generational cycle or or
[48:41] well it sure it has to be I don't know
[48:43] if it would be considered a generational
[48:45] curse but it certainly I think it
[48:49] constricts it boxes in a generation and
[48:55] I think when we really love our children
[48:57] we we want them to to excel to go up
[49:02] and beyond the kind of life that we have
[49:06] had
[49:06] now that predisposition can run in many
[49:11] many different areas of our life again
[49:16] as we mentioned just a little bit
[49:17] earlier it can be addictions can be
[49:20] drugs it can be alcohol it can be
[49:23] pornography it can be so many different
[49:26] things remember we're looking for
[49:28] patterns we're looking for cycles that
[49:33] have passed from generation to
[49:35] generation when we recognize them we're
[49:39] going to repent of our generation being
[49:43] involved and we're going to repent
[49:46] before the Lord for our fathers and
[49:48] grandfathers and when I say this
[49:51] repentance it to me it's a prayer that
[49:54] says you know I don't want this thing to
[49:57] continue my perhaps my parents didn't
[50:00] realize that my grandparents didn't
[50:02] realize it so I just repent on behalf of
[50:05] those who were before me it's not some
[50:08] technical I've got to say it the right
[50:11] way this kind of thing because the
[50:14] scripture actually says later in Ezekiel
[50:17] that when we answer to God we're only
[50:20] responsible for our sins and not the
[50:24] sins of our parents and grandparents so
[50:27] it's not the sin that I'm talking about
[50:30] particularly being carried on from
[50:32] generation to generation
[50:34] it's the weakness it's the liability the
[50:37] tendency the predisposition towards
[50:40] certain things that we want to see cut
[50:43] off the life taken right out of it and
[50:46] it's those demon spirits that I believe
[50:49] Satan assigns to perpetuate to keep
[50:53] alive that cycle so that it keeps
[50:56] passing on I tell you it makes me pretty
[50:59] disturbed I get pretty angry when I see
[51:02] how the enemy likes to wrap up
[51:04] generations of families I'm gonna list
[51:07] some of the ways and we're going to pray
[51:10] a prayer as we go off the air but we'll
[51:13] have to carry this topic forward I'm
[51:15] going to
[51:16] you through a prayer I'm going to show
[51:18] you in the scripture what we can do to
[51:22] absolutely break that cycle once and for
[51:26] all to see that curse removed so that we
[51:29] can go forward and again this is
[51:32] available to us because of the cross
[51:35] because of the work that Jesus
[51:37] accomplished on our behalf I want to
[51:41] list a few things here and just mention
[51:43] that not in every case but in some cases
[51:48] these things will continue to pass on in
[51:52] families as a generational cycle or as a
[51:57] generational curse for instance divorce
[51:59] and when we say divorce we could also
[52:03] say that infidelity adultery
[52:06] unfaithfulness in a marriage that kind
[52:09] of thing can pass on and on and on I
[52:12] want you to know that this was something
[52:15] that was definitely a stronghold in my
[52:18] family in the generations that were
[52:21] before me
[52:22] my great grandfather my grandfather my
[52:25] father unfaithful to their vow to their
[52:28] commitment and this was certainly
[52:31] something that I had to recognize I had
[52:35] to pray about it pray against it because
[52:38] I certainly didn't want that to be a
[52:40] part of my life and I definitely didn't
[52:43] want it to be a part of my children's
[52:45] life but I can see three generations and
[52:48] perhaps more but I'm personally aware of
[52:51] three generations that dealt with with
[52:54] unfaithfulness and the breaking of vows
[52:57] and covenants another another sin
[53:01] another really serious bad behavior that
[53:05] can pass on from generation to
[53:07] generation in a family is incest having
[53:11] inappropriate relationship with family
[53:14] members which which is abuse and which
[53:18] is very very dangerous because it marks
[53:22] it marks children it marks teenagers
[53:27] they carry these
[53:29] ours into their life and if that cycle
[53:34] is not broken by the blood of Jesus and
[53:36] sincere prayer it carries on to the next
[53:40] generation poverty poverty can be a
[53:45] generational curse or cycle you accept
[53:49] the fact that you'll never have anything
[53:51] and you you you you end up at times
[53:53] people end up developing a very lazy
[53:56] lifestyle because they feel their curse
[54:00] they feel like we can never be anything
[54:03] but but in poverty and just hand the
[54:05] mouth and and not be able to break
[54:07] through into a better job or a better
[54:09] career that can be broken you can stop
[54:13] that now
[54:14] another is anger oh my how a bad temper
[54:19] can travel generationally from one
[54:25] generation to the next I mean hot heated
[54:30] violent anger can take a hold in
[54:34] families and it's a pattern that can
[54:37] absolutely be broken and there are many
[54:40] other ungodly patterns that we have
[54:44] recognized through the years some of
[54:47] these are listed here because of my own
[54:49] experience as a pastor watching how the
[54:52] enemy takes advantage of a generation
[54:56] they had nothing to do with the sin of
[55:00] the parents or grandparents Tyl but the
[55:03] enemy takes advantage of another
[55:06] generation and he assigns those demonic
[55:09] spirits to create this sense of
[55:14] vulnerability and my I've watched the
[55:17] devil do things as as complex as making
[55:22] these things available putting it right
[55:25] up in their face having people to offer
[55:28] it to them free of charge and and
[55:31] someone just innocently taking that
[55:33] because it was the the pattern that was
[55:36] set before them not realizing that you
[55:38] are falling into a generational
[55:42] you're falling into a cycle that has
[55:45] come down upon you from another
[55:47] generation and you can be free but there
[55:49] was the enemy setting things up to make
[55:52] it so easy thanks be to God we can be
[55:56] free we can be delivered we can walk out
[55:59] of that cycle that pattern father in the
[56:01] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[56:03] I feel handicapped a bit because I want
[56:07] to to finish this but my time is gone
[56:10] and so lord I ask right now that you
[56:13] will speak to hearts and lives and that
[56:17] men and women will will use their mind
[56:20] and think a little and just see if they
[56:22] have noticed these kinds of patterns in
[56:25] their own generations and father help us
[56:29] to know that every curse is dealt with
[56:32] by the shed blood of Jesus Christ and
[56:34] Satan cannot hold us if we choose to be
[56:39] free in Jesus Lord I'm asking you that
[56:43] over the course of this study that that
[56:46] that generations will be changed that
[56:49] lives will be set free hallelujah that
[56:53] this pattern will not be able to
[56:55] continue from one generation to another
[56:58] the abuse the physical domestic abuse
[57:02] husbands abusing their wives etc I pray
[57:06] O God that this pattern can be exposed
[57:09] that the light can be shined on it ha
[57:12] and that you will give freedom and
[57:15] deliverance because Lord Jesus you paid
[57:17] the price with your own blood to set us
[57:21] free we ask these things and decree them
[57:25] done in the name of the Lord Jesus
[57:29] Christ amen
[57:31] well I hope you've learned something
[57:34] perhaps I have created lots of questions
[57:38] in your mind and we will address some of
[57:42] those questions when we meet again god
[57:45] bless you thank you for sticking with us
[57:47] today
[57:48] until next time bye-bye
