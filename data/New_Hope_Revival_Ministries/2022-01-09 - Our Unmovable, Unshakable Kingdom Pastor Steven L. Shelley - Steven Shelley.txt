don't have to worry about what anything or anybody else is doing i can go to the rock and find my strength and courage in the rock know that he's got the answers for me amen we want to go to prayer today and take our needs as you see there are many that are missing from among us and we want to remember every one of them the lord knows the need as we go to prayer i've been sent these requests for from sister sharon there's a lady named meredith that is asking that we would pray she's getting a pathology report tomorrow concerning a hysterectomy and she would appreciate if we pray concerning that report we ask the lord to touch this lady also for natasha at the loss of her father and daily focus on the loss of her husband let's ask the lord to give her grace as she deals with the grief the lord would minister to her and that she would give it to the lord she would know how to give it to the lord and then there are also several pastors seeking god for deeper truths and wisdom in this season the lord knows who they are and i know that the lord knows how to open up the eyes of the blind he knows how to reveal more truth to us do you have need by the lifting of the hand today all over this building those of you that are watching this service by the stream though we cannot see your hands we're remembering you to the lord today asking the lord to minister to your needs that you have we have several needs uh would you pray for brother steve curry he was in the hospital uh two nights ago and they gave him fluids and some iv i guess it was iv fluid and maybe some broad spectrum antibiotic and he was only there one night and because of the new protocol sister anita couldn't stay with him they came home yesterday about i think they got home about five o'clock and last night about 11 they got a phone call from the cancer treatment center telling them that there was bacteria in his blood and he needed to get to the emergency room as quickly as possible to get on an iv well that's a little bit hard to do but they got him to houston and they started him on a specific after the cultures came back a specific antibiotic and he has now been transported back to the cancer center and uh sister anita was going home to get a little rest because they will not let her stay with him right now but she can go up i think later today for a visit so we're praying against bacteria in his bloodstream that god will give him total deliverance over that and his ability to hold fluid to keep fluid he is losing fluid it is they're just having a hard time keeping him hydrated we want to believe that god but but they told me that the oncologist looked at him and said you you look unbelievable we can't hardly believe the change and he has some swelling but he has gained weight and that that was a big shock to them so we want to remember them to the lord in prayer solomon tested positive for kovid on the day that he left here and uh so there were a few people exposed and that's why they're not here today there is fever at rj's house and with that new little baby there we're praying hard for them that god will give them great protection and grace over this sister teresa has been having some cold symptoms and possible exposure brother robert possible exposure at work and so there are several who have opted not to be here today because of protecting us they wanted to protect those of us who would be gathered here we ask that everyone would just use wisdom if you know that you've been exposed then you should pray a little bit and consider how how you you know interact with other people i i feel a little bit bad because someone made a statement to me not a believer but someone made a statement to me said well if i tested positive i would just go to the store and do whatever i else i'd been doing and let let everybody suffer like i was suffering i would hope that god's people would be smarter and wiser and more loving than that so we've got to be watchful and so let's pray for all of these uh sister pam i mean she is my sister by faith pam tebow uh meeks haskovid and so we're praying for her and there was exposure and that's why uh that's why luke and megan are not here today is to protect us but let's ask the lord to move in all of this you know in my in my flesh i say here we go again but you know there's no reason to be alarmed or fearful we just say god watch over us all keep us safe uh let's just be mindful of the elderly that are here today if you're you know those that are a little bit older or have some other conditions let's just stay away from them as much as possible not be right up in their face this is a very contagious strain it's affecting people a lot less but there are some who are suffering greatly from it the hospitals are putting in new protocol no visitors it's it's you know there's a lot going on again so we want to ask god to help every one of these uh michael was having a cough and had some symptoms and so he was going to be tested and that means that they're not here today so we want to lift every one of them up to the lord we're traveling this week we want to be protected and we want to have grace and mercy as we go out and come in and for others who will be traveling as well remind me of the name of the brother that powell that passed away yes 50 powell jerry don powell jerry dawn powell so known him for many years family grieving therein 50 years old so we want to remember all of these needs would you stand with us as we go to the lord in prayer our lord is faithful he is

sufficient for every trial isn't it amen uh we would like to also i know that brother greeley mentioned sister tebow and sister flow in prayer we always every service and all during the week we want to lift them up to the lord in prayer and spoke with garvis this week and they removed a drain from the surgery that sister flo had and the other one will go out sometime in the near future and she took the big bandage off she was so glad to be free from that and had a good report in the pathology of her surgery she had a good report and they were thanking god for that and sister tebow finishing up her radiation treatment and is asking for prayer every day she's just wanting us to continue to pray that the lord will strengthen her heal her help her she has some mighty tough decisions ahead just the next few days and weeks and we want to pray that god will give her the grace and the direction that she needs there are certain decisions that others can make for us they can help us they can advise us they can share their opinion with us they can threaten us even but when it comes down to it there are certain decisions that only you can make for your life for your help for your future and we are asking the lord to give her the wisdom that she desires we didn't mention this but i've been told not directly from the family but indirectly that brother bill younce and sister shirley have both have had coveted this week and uh that brother bill is yesterday was not doing good he has a good day and a bad day and i'm mentioning them because they're old friends of this church and friends of mine for so many years and i'm mentioning it because they have birthdays this week and we would like for them to have perfect healing to go with their birthday and not have to suffer today is sister shirley's birthday and wednesday is brother bill's birthday he turns 78 on wednesday of this week has suffered massive strokes has been through so much over the past few years but still pastoring and still at his post of duty and most every sunday and so would you ask the lord to give them deliverance from this virus and all the other things that may be working particularly against brother bill the only other birthday that i had on my list was next saturday avian has a birthday is that right on saturday hold up your hand so everybody can see how old will you be you're tall as

we're gonna come look for you that means you've been missed god bless you all let's stand today let's go to god's word let's see what the lord has for us let's remember every one of these who are streaming this service today youtube facebook on the app on the website that god will speak to their hearts and meet their needs and some are putting their prayer request in sister ethel is asking for help for her son andrew who is dealing with excruciating pain god knows andrew and he knows how to touch him and uh we're being greeted this morning from all over god bless every one of you faithful brothers and sisters who are with us today we want to just give god praise thank you musicians we're just going to let you go thank you for being here we sure miss all those that are not here let's turn in our bibles today to matthew chapter six if you need to go in and out do that after the reading of the scripture and get that over with and then you can sit with us or as much of the service as possible i love every one of you and i don't want to put a damper on this service by saying this but there is a lot of traffic in and out and in and out and in and out if we could just keep that to a minimum it would be a great blessing in helping to keep a holy atmosphere we work hard in worship to build a good atmosphere so the word can come forth and we don't want you to miss you know you may not realize the importance but but there is a great importance in getting all that we can to be ready to get out of here we're being dressed god is dressing his bride and i'm so thankful for that if you know you're going to be in and out maybe you just sit closer to the back and then you won't you won't disturb so many people in and out it would be a great blessing matthew 6 verse 10 this is our lord teaching his disciples how to pray thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven why don't we read it together one time even as a prayer thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven now i want you to turn before you're seated to hebrews chapter 12. i'm going to read from verse 18 to verse 29 i want to speak today on our unshakable unmovable kingdom our unshakable unmovable kingdom verse 18 for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burn with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they that heard and treated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touched the mountain it shall be stoned or thirst through with a thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that moses said i exceedingly fear and quake but ye are come unto mount zion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth you all hear that something's going off up here it could be the are there headphones up here it could be in the headphone i'm not going to tell you what it sounded like it sounded like a rattle we may be put to the test and if we do i'm going to ask you where you want the back door i'm not sure i have the faith to take up the snake but i might i think it sounded to me like it was coming out of a of a headset it was uh sounded like a something coming out of that headset there forgive us whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore this is where we are wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved are you with me in the word wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire read 28-29 with me again wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire let's pray together lord jesus we come to you by the great grace and privilege that you have given us we are not coming as beggars we are coming as invited sons to lay our petition before you today and when we leave it on the altar we walk away with the assurance that you have taken our burden you are bearing our cares and you are helping us with everything that we have need of for we are a needy people today now lord we have fought this week all of the things that we fight as believers we have faced many situations since we gathered together on tuesday night but by grace we have made it through we are here today to receive something from your word that will strengthen us that will empower and equip us to face whatever it is that comes our way this coming week we need your word to sustain us we need your word to strengthen us so we approach you with a humble heart and yet boldly because of the invitation we ask that you would infuse us with your life today we pray for holy ghost protection over every person under the sound of my voice from the top of their head to the souls of their feet we pray lord that if they come in contact with that virus that the holy ghost in them and the healing virtue of the lord would just repel it and push it back in this hour we don't want anything to hinder our ability to gather in your name we need it lord i need it i need that corporate anointing that we experience this morning in worship and we ask lord that you would give us a grace to be able to continue in this way come now in the wonderful name of the lord jesus christ we pray and the saints said amen you may be seated hebrews is showing us in the writings of the apostle paul quite a contrast of mountains he said there was a time that we were called to mount sinai and that was a different kind of mountain than the one we're called to in this hour it was a mountain of lightnings and thunderings and voices mysterious shofar blasts shakings and rumblings and thick clouds and flashes of color and light it was such a display that even moses was struck by the awesomeness in fact the word that is used here by by the writer is terrible and we know that this is not terrible in the sense of awful but it is it is being awestruck it is absolutely standing almost speechless and motionless as you look at all the activity that's going on on the top of this mountain but paul said we are not called in this hour to approach god on mount sinai we have another invitation all together we have a mountain that's more welcoming than mount sinai now paul wants to bring a balance in the end of this reading and so he tells us that yes we must accept what god has done for us and we must serve god in an acceptable manner and we must approach him in reverence and godly fear so we're not just throwing ourselves haphazardly on mount zion there is a protocol anytime we approach the king do you understand that we want to come with a humble heart we want to come with clean hands but i want you to know the environment of sinai will stay back make sure you keep your distance because if you break through you may die if even an animal should get too close to the base of that mountain the animal was thrust through and he fell over dead so i'm telling you that's not really a welcoming environment it wasn't intended to be it was a place where god would meet his prophet and this prophet would come down out of that mountain and deliver the word of the lord to the people it wasn't an invitation to the congregation it was only to them that god would speak to lip to ear and moses would then come and he would declare the word of the lord the people didn't want moses you know they didn't want a prophet standing between them and god until they heard his voice on the top of mount sinai then they said hey could you come back and help us out we don't really want to hear his voice because what we've seen is so awesome and so terrible we don't want to be consumed by it we would much rather you stand between us and god and so this was god's way of bringing the people to accept a prophet for their day and we're thankful for how god used moses and joshua who followed him there's a different environment in the body of christ today this should not be an environment that that causes us to be lax or to be slack or to be lukewarm it's not an environment that should encourage us to let down our standard it should be an encouragement to keep the standard as high as it has ever been because the enemy would like to come in with compromise and he would like for some to lose out you and i may not be focusing on those things but i'm telling you they're weak people they're weaker christian than you that are focusing on these things and to those who focus on those things it becomes a stumbling block to them and the bible said be careful that you don't lay a stumbling block in your neighbor's path amen so don't get any shorter no no shorter you've gotten about the limit of how short you can go with your dresses so don't do that because this is an hour where people oh it gets quiet 25 years ago i used to say that and people say hey man brother come on preach it now that's because you weren't guilty and when people are not guilty well they can just say man loud and bold and fine and getting such a blessing out of it but if there's some that kind of fall under the influence i want you to know we are a part of an entirely different kingdom than the one we're living in it seems oh yes we're thankful i'm so thankful that we're not living on mount sinai i'm thankful that we're living on mount zion i'm thankful that there's a difference in the atmosphere but it doesn't mean that we can let down the bar it doesn't mean we can compromise the word it doesn't mean that we can look like the world it doesn't give us permission to show off uh those things that we have covered in modesty because we're in the end time it's a time to be more modest you say well who are you preaching to every person under the sound of my voice whoever has an ear to hear let them hear it's an hour to hold on with everything you've got don't remove the ancient landmarks but stand amen there are standards that are given to us in the scripture that are uncompromisable they can't be moved they can't be changed there are community standards that we might have as a part of who we are as a community of faith and we need to be very very careful with those because if you don't understand you can really get off the track and you can really confuse someone who is weak paul tells us it's the weaker ones among us who are watching the diet and who are watching every feast and watching all these things making sure that everybody no one's eating that that's been sacrificed to animals and so forth those people have uh value as well because i've once been a weak one have you ever been a weak one so when we get a little weaker we start examining each other and we don't want to do that because if you've got your eyes on people it means you're not looking at jesus i need a little help you want to put all of your focus on the lord jesus christ and watch him we're thankful for zion we're thankful that we are a part of a kingdom that cannot be shaken this world is shaking right everything we know is being shaken in this hour we've had two plus years of unusual shakings things that we have perhaps never dealt with before in in our lifetime we don't hardly know what to think about it i heard a report this week that said because of the virus the flu will never be the same and that it will be more deadly going forward than it has ever been before i don't have to tell you the dark bleak prophecy that our president has made again this year dark winter of death i tell you if that was the only hope i had you talk about people getting depressed in the winter what if you've got a national leader telling you oh you're going to lose i heard this statement made families that are grieving will grieve more as we go through this long dark winter well i want you to know they're just reporting what they know they're just reporting what they understand they're speaking of their own kingdom the kingdom that they're in fellowship with but i want you to understand we're living in another kingdom we're simultaneously on planet earth yes but we're living in another kingdom i remember an old song the hoppers used to sing said i'm a citizen of two worlds and it's hard to choose between them back then i thought that was a great song because you'd like to be with the lord but you'd like to be with your loved ones i understood what they meant but i want you to know i'm not singing that in 2022. it's hard to choose between them there's no choice there's no choice to be made we have already been born into an alternative kingdom in fact it's the original kingdom it's not the perverted one that we call planet earth the environment and society around us is a perverted society and a perverted atmosphere from the original that god created in eden we're not just going back to pentecost but the word has restored us all the way back to eden and i heard brother branham say this week do you know what that means he said it means dominion it means authority it means a people who are so much in tune with the kingdom of god that they are not movable they are not shakeable but they are standing firm like in a way really stronger than they have ever stood before because the winds that we have known in these past two years have caused our roots i hope and pray to go deeper into god's word so that nothing will move us off the truth we're going to stay with that truth no matter what people around us do we're going to stay with that word if you have that as your intention let me hear you say amen now we're moving on colossians chapter 1 and verse 12 and 13. i want to read those verses of scripture before we break the message what god is giving us for today colossians 1 12 and 13 giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light now the next verse who hath delivered us from the power of darkness how many of you are delivered from the power of darkness i want to testify of god's great grace who has delivered us from the power of darkness and then what has he done he has what translated us not he will not one glorious day but he hath translated us into what the kingdom of his dear son you my brother sister have been born by the transforming and translating power of the holy spirit out of the darkness of this world out of the kingdom of men out of the kingdom of darkness out of the kingdom of this world and into the kingdom of god we look for the kingdom of heaven but we have already been translated into the kingdom of his dear son and that kingdom is an unshakable kingdom it is an unmovable kingdom no matter what the devil pulls out of his bag of tricks in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed beginning in paragraph 154 brother branham is preaching to us in that sermon on on the threefold purpose of his coming he said the coming of jesus to the earth can be summed up into three different purposes or expressions the threefold purpose of his coming and i love the way it's brought out here it's very condensed he preaches a whole sermon on it but here it's condensed first to express his self completely god in christ the most important mystery for you and i to get a hold of if we haven't already is that jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new there is no higher revelation than that there's other revelation that builds in that but that is perhaps the highest of all revelation and you say doesn't everybody believe that what is the answer no no they don't they don't believe that jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new this was the the first goal or purpose of jesus christ coming as the word made flesh to planet earth so that god in christ so that god could be fully completely expressed in the earth in the body of the anointed one god in a man oh this is so glorious and so wonderful to understand this great love story he loved us so much that he wanted to become even as we are so that he might make a way for you and i to become what he is what a glorious revelation second to have the preeminences by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them god sent christ to express himself completely in the earth number one number two god sent christ so that you and i might come to a place of allowing christ to have preeminence in our life that he might become the most important thing the most important one the brother sister you don't have a more important relationship there is no more important relate not not boss employee husband wife mother daughter father son brother in christ sister in christ there is no greater relationship in life than the one that you have been invited to have with god through jesus christ it should be the most important thing in all of our lives building that relationship feeding that relationship focusing on that relationship by chewing his word and allowing it to be digested in the spirit man so that we might then begin to reflect that so number one god's purpose in the earth by sending christ was that he might be completely represented in the earth in the body of our lord number two that he might be completely represented in the earth by the body of christ by the bride by the sons of god by those who were elected to come and demonstrate and express who jesus is to the whole world around us jesus is alive and well i want to tell you today jesus is alive and well i want to say to you streamers jesus is alive and well and he's living in his bride we're no longer in the in the in this in the same hour the the first hour the first dispensation the first revelation and understanding of this was that christ is the mystery of god revealed then we come to a revelation that the bride is the mystery of christ revealed now i know you've heard that before but i want to say it slow enough for you to make sure you're getting what we're saying if christ is the mystery of god revealed and we know that he is then the bride must be now the mystery of christ revealed in the earth meaning that god is now revealed through the bride are you with me now paragraph 156 he says he gives us the next and thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightly position the very purpose of the coming of christ to the earth was to restore god's kingdom to its rightly position now that means that there were those who were translated to the kingdom of god in the day and in the ministry of our lord jesus christ so for 2 000 years men and women have been translated by the new birth by the baptism of the holy ghost they have been translated from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of god this is not a future translation we're looking for a body change we're looking for a future translation for our body but now we're talking about what he has done for us spiritually he has already translated us from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of god so that the kingdom of god might be put back right into its rightful position in the earth how did the kingdom of god fall it fell by sin by the first adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talked with them fellowshipped with them that is the kingdom that is the kingdom that christ came thirdly to restore in the earth a kingdom of fellowship with god now i know we make this statement you know he's just about too spiritually minded to be any earthly good well some people become fanatics but not because they've been working on their relationship with jesus christ anybody awake not because they've been working on their relationship with jesus christ that doesn't make you a fanatic come on now when you try to do it by your own effort by your own strife by your own sweat by your own labor that might make you a fanatic but when you come to him humbly and sincerely and you say lord i want to empty everything that i am i want to get it all laid out on the table so you can put me back together like you created me to be in the beginning i want to be restored to your first thoughts about me i want you to know folk i don't know if you can follow this today or not i'm not sure where you are physically or how you're feeling or whatever but i want you to understand that i believe with everything that i am that god is building a people in the last days who will be a part of a great quick last day expression of god's power in the earth i do not believe the bride's revival is finished i do not believe that god has done the last of what he's going to do i don't believe it's all over i don't believe we understand the fullness of the thunders as it is being preached all across the country i don't believe the fullness of that understanding has come to us yet it's there it's there i don't believe we understand the fullness of the seventh seal it's there i'm not saying it's something new i'm saying what he said he said i couldn't get it it went by me in an unknown tongue you heard him say you heard him say it was sealed up it won't we won't have the understanding of it until god chooses to let it sound again and when it does the bride will catch that it won't be something brand new like something she's never ever heard before it'll be some truth brother adam said laying in this word it'll be quickened to you let me ask you a question how many of you know some things but you know they've not yet been made alive you know it's right you know there are things you know there's things you understand because you've been a student of the word in the message but you're not walking in it you know i can't say i'm always sick feel i don't always feel like i'm seated in heavenly places with christ but i am i am there's never a time that i'm not because i've been pulled up into that place i just don't always take full advantage of where i've been called to and you don't either but there are things that will be quickened in us and made alive in us as we understand some simple things there are many simple truths that we have to let become a part of who we are so that we can start positioning ourselves to receive the understanding of those things that we do not yet have and nobody likes the simple i'll just be honest with you not not seemingly around this message anyway we try to over complicate things come on it gives us a sense of elitism when we complicate things that nobody else can understand but you know that's not the way it was intended to be god didn't want it to be that way he wanted to break it down and make it simple god wanted to express himself fully in the body on the earth so he did it he came in christ he wanted to have a people that will fully express christ to the earth around them so he did it he called out an elected bride and number three he wanted to restore the kingdom to its rightful position and in order for that to happen you've got to understand that you've got a king and you're living in a kingdom and it's not the united states of america and it's not planet earth it's the kingdom of god and the kingdom of god has its own way of doing things earth does it one way the world does it one way secular society does it one way but god's kingdom has an entirely different way to operate it has its own economics the economics of the kingdom of god are not like the economics of this world just a simple example if you want to have something you got to hold on to what you got you got to put it this is how the world teaches you've got to put it in a safe place not too risky and then watch that thing grow don't ever touch it watch it grow i don't want to go into anything that might persuade you one way or the other but you know stocks aren't enough so now it's cryptocurrency it'll be this or that or the other it's just going to continue to evolve and people are going to ride this trend or that trend or the other trend and that's how the economics of this world operate but the economics of the kingdom of god operate entirely differently that kingdom doesn't tell you to hold on to what you got that kingdom tells you to sow a seed you don't hide it in a hole to save it you actually turn loose of it to save it the only way you're promised to return from that is not by hiding it in a hole but by investing it into the kingdom of god i'm not going to preach on giving but i just want you to understand that the economics of the kingdom of god are not like the economics of the united states even even uh what's the guy that folk trust so much dave ramsey who who you know he gives amazing advice about two-thirds of it he's being called into question across the board now because of some of the advice that he gives there are other christian economists who are coming along and saying this is really dangerous advice and so they're kind of fighting it out and has to do with term life insurance and whole life and all the different things and so forth and etc and some when it did different than he did and they made a whole lot more than those who did what he said and so forth oh i can't keep up with that i don't mean we shouldn't be wise we should be wise but our main focus should be understanding that we are living in another kingdom altogether and the more like this world you become the more caught up you're going to be in in its kingdom dynamic how many of you want to operate in the dynamics of the kingdom of god i want to be a part of those economics i want that government to be a part of who i am i want the protocol of the kingdom of god to be the way i live my life i don't want to let the world be my example i want god's word to be my example are you with me i don't want everybody's doing it to be the way i choose what i'm going to do i want to hear another drumbeat i want to hear another heartbeat i want to march to the heartbeat of the king of kings and the lord of lords are you with me in the message five definite identifications of the true church of the living god if you haven't heard that it'd be a great opportunity now in the near future for you to go back and catch a little bit of that five definite identifications of the true church of the living god that's quite a title isn't it paragraph 180. he said what is the identification of the church what is she to be what was she what is it the called out group who set it up jesus christ not a bishop not the catholic church not methodist not luther not wesley no sir who set it up jesus christ what's what is its message repentance water baptism baptism of the holy ghost divine healing salvation how do we become a member of it by being born into it do you believe that can we get to heaven without it no sir for those that are dead in christ will god bring with him and not anyone else but those who are dead in christ he goes on jesus is coming for those that are dead in christ ephesians 4 chapter said no galatians i believe it is the fourth chapter said that those that are dead in christ will god bring with him those that are dead in christ will god bring with him now let's look at the next paragraph are we there yet yes now therefore she is a what called out group called out she heard a cry she heard a call she answered the call she moved away from her group and she found another group one that she'd been called to brother branham said a mystical body there's mystery in this body it's not like other bodies it's not like being a member of the odd fellas it's not like joining the masons or the shriners it's not a sorority it's not a club it's a mystical body a body is something made up of members all connected to one another functioning together for a greater purpose he said it's a mystical body who said it in order not peter not the pope christ set it in order before he died he spoke of it coming he said i will come and be king over this domain a little while and the world won't see me no more yet you shall see me you won't have nothing to do with the kingdom of the world you won't have nothing to do with the kingdom of the world you won't have nothing to do with the kingdom of the world if you're a part of the kingdom of god you won't have nothing to do with the kingdom of the world now you may not know this but this is so opposite of what the church is teaching today because they've got the seven mountain mandates you know where they believe that the church is going to take over these seven mountains of influence one of them being government one of them being hollywood and it goes on there's seven different ones i don't say that i could name them all now and it becomes quite a focus and multiple books are written about it in seminars and conferences and people are rushing there and they want to see how they might get involved in politics and how they might get involved in hollywood how they might get involved in the different aspects economics and whatever all these different mountains of influence but here a prophet a vindicated servant of the lord is telling us that once you understand who you are in the kingdom of god you won't have nothing to do with the kingdom of the world you see holy ghost-filled people are not being called into government office not in this hour it's far too late for that somebody said i don't understand how that could be possible and then you tell us to pray that the right one well we pray till we turn blue in the face but we understand that god is sovereign and we understand it's god who raises up kings and pulls them down come on but we still go and vote according to our conscience and according to how we feel led and what we expect and would like to see but we know that in the end of that god gets the last word a lot of disappointed people i still hear from them almost daily at least every other day i still get articles sent to me of how just any day now just any day now just any day now just any day now just any day now this whole thing's going to be turned over and the election in georgia's already someone told me it's about 14 days and the election in georgia is going to be overturned and that's going to throw the tide and and we're gonna celebrate the last three years of this with our president trump back in office and people are focusing on this and focusing on that even some of you get caught up in that from time to time but let me just say it's all right to have your thoughts and your feelings but once you become a part of the kingdom of god you won't have nothing to do with the kingdom of the world you will understand there's a different way of operation there's a different way of of of putting our focus and our attention and our heart into something if you want to prosper you put your heart into the kingdom of god you give god everything that he's asking of you you become a reflection of who he is in the earth and you're then a part a citizen of a kingdom that cannot be shaken and it can't be moved no matter who the president is is anybody with me she's a called out group a mystical body christ set it in order before he died he spoke of it coming i will come and be king over this domain a little while the world won't see me no more yet you'll see me you won't have nothing to do with the kingdom of the world look at john 3 with me just a moment i'm uh i wish i could thrill you but since i can't i'll just do my best to preach anyway john 3 3 jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god we know that we know that you've got to know you've been born again with that very word translated the phrase translated means born from a higher place have you been born from above you were born from beneath when you were born here on the earth you were born of this kingdom you came here by a sex act you came here by natural birth process that's your first birth but the most important birth course you couldn't have the second without the first but the most important is your second birth your new birth because now in that moment you were born from above and the spirit of god then you're translated into a kingdom that cannot be shaken that cannot be moved and you now are filled with the very life of god the very life that was in the lord jesus christ verse 4 said nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he's old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered and said verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god he goes on that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit you had to have a flesh birth you had to be born into the flesh you had to be expressed in the earth there's no doubt about it but that which is born of the spirit is spirit and that's the greatest birth marvel not that i've said unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and now here is the sound thereof but can't not tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit you don't understand them sometimes they don't understand themselves but they're doing what they can to be led by the spirit of god and i want you to know that's a that's a hard life sometimes because you have to stop and people don't like to stop you have to stop and contemplate you have to stop and pray you have to stop and miss a meal you have to stop and pull yourself aside sometime and make sure that you're still moving in synchronization with the heart of the father because there's a world around you that's trying to pull you into another kingdom anybody with me i'm gonna pull you into another kingdom i love this this place read read with me in bomb of gilead paragraph 20 the prophet of god said our spirits has been born from above and in that land where we come from the nature and the habits of that land is holiness cleanliness godliness and if the spirit of that land moves into us then this land becomes strange to us because we're carrying the characteristics of another land of another homeland of another kingdom holiness cleanliness godliness and if the spirit of that land moves into us then this land is a strange to us and it goes on because your soul and your spirit motivates you it makes you what you are powerful it's not your body that makes you who you are it's not even what you are on the outside that makes you who you are it's what you are on the inside it's what's going on in your soul life in your spirit life he said and you'll never be able to join churches and get that out of you you'll still be a church member and make fun of people who preach against such immorals you've got to be born again from above then you are new creatures in christ jesus and you're as abraham was you're his children you are seeking a city whose builder and maker is god that's why you act different that's why you see things different how how many times do you feel like beating your head on the wall because you can't get a co-worker to see it like you see it how many of you feel like that some even with your own family you just try to present a different alternative of thought and and it's like you're speaking a foreign language to them they can't even begin to understand i've heard ben and different ones talk about folks they work with and things that they've said and things they look they think it's ridiculous listen one example they think it's ridiculous for a woman to stay at home with her children why wouldn't everybody in the whole wide world want to have two incomes they can't understand it why the government free they use your text money and and put programs into existence to watch after your children and to school your children and take care of your children and teach them all they need to know why would a mother a smart woman a creative woman why would she want to stay home with her children and waste who she is when she could be making as much money as her husband in today's society and they could be living twice assumptiously now you can't fault people for that that's the kingdom that they are citizens of that is exactly the common thinking of the kingdom of this world you you'll never you're never going to cause them to see things your way until they have experienced what you have experienced and that is that great new birth that translates us from the kingdom of the world to the kingdom of god it takes us out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light and it changes the way we think it changes the way we speak it changes the way we live it changes the way we look at things it changes the way we behave the way we act the way we dress everything we do is a different order than the world around us if you know i'm telling the truth maybe you squeeze out a little amen instead of a blank stare just a small one maybe just nod your head just a little bit and perhaps understand you can work with them and you can talk to them you can try to convince them they'll never see your politics they'll never see your way of doing economics because you're operating on the dynamics of another kingdom all together and they say why my goodness your why what makes a woman think she's qualified to teach her children why shouldn't they be why it ought to be a law they ought to make they ought to come and force the children to don't worry don't worry if they can force you to take something in your body that you choose not to have in your body or fire you on the spot don't worry the day will also come that they'll come for your children it's a truth and they'll say well how how is it that you think you can have them at home they belong in school it's the law and you may look at me like that'll never happen it's already happened in foreign countries it's already happened in europe and it has happened in certain states in america where homeschoolers have been greatly persecuted in fact a large group of church of god people moved out of the states and into canada because they were tired of being oppressed in the practice of their religion their holiness in nature they don't believe in in tongues and gifts operating like that but they dress very conservative and live very conservative and they homeschool their children they teach them at home and they were being so persecuted in the northern states of this country that they moved to canada and these same people are the ones you're seeing in the news right now who have been arrested who have been imprisoned who have been fined hundreds of thousands of dollars in canada because they continued to have services during the lockdown so they thought if we can just get out of america we'll have freedom so they get to canada and it was worse it has been worse we don't know of people suffering in this country during the lockdown like those people have suffered the pastor's not arrested once but multiple times and find over a half a million dollars in one court case a half a million dollars and you know what they just went right on going padlocked the church door so they met out in the grass some of you have seen some of it at least in social media these are people who left this country because they were being harassed over home school so don't you think we're immune that kingdom out there is never going to understand the kingdom of god only when they have the birth you've had only if they're born again of the spirit of god so if you care anything about them it's not your politics you need to talk with them it's not all the things we're against that you need to talk to them what if i told you it's not even brother branham you need to sell to them you need to talk to them about what it means to be born again but you'll never have any influence with them if they see that your life is just like theirs if all you talk about is movies if all you talk about is video games if all you talk about is sports then they're going to say well there's no different than we are but if you find ways and i don't mean i don't think i have to say this to this church but i don't mean be religious i don't mean you have to talk like like i've heard people talk before praise the lord thank you jesus glory to god i just want to talk to you about your soul praise the lord glory to god like to see you come hallelujah thank you jesus like to invite you to come glory to god come to my church they're going to offer you a nerve pill they're not going to understand that you've just got to go live a humble life brother branham said just go live a humble christian life in front of him just be salty [Music] you don't go to work flying your trump flag come on i appreciate what we've had but that's not how you're going to win people to christ come on come on you might ought to consider that confederate flag on your vehicle although i'm not i'm not opposed to the existence of such a flag because it's a part of our history but you're going to greatly reduce your ability to minister to certain groups of people if you're flying in the in the work parking lot oh sometimes you've got to use a little wisdom because your main purpose in life the reason why you're here is not so you can keep feeding your 401 your main purpose for being here is to be a light in a dark world to be salt so that they become thirsty around us to to to manifest that jesus has the preeminence in your life and do it in a non-religious way but in a very powerful way because the bible tells us here that the that the kingdom of god in first corinthians chapter 4 verse 20 first corinthians 4 20 for the kingdom of god is not in word but in power one of the things i appreciate about brother robert's prayer request and his testimonies that he gives us some time from his workplace is because he's made enough of an influence over there that when people need prayer they're reaching out to him i was in a restaurant eating last sunday and and they came in the restaurant with a gentleman that he used to work with and they sit down at a table they speak to us but they sit down in a table with a gentleman that he works with and it warmed my heart they interstopped and introduced him to their pastor but it warmed my heart i thought that's exactly oh god help me because the lord knows i'd rather be with church folks than anybody but my heart was warmed and i thought my how wonderful they can have a relationship with somebody like that who may need to hear something other than what they can hear on fox news or see an end maybe they need some good news presented to them not in word only but in power and in demonstration how many of you understand what i'm saying i know you do uh go back to my quote if you will you've got to be born again from above did we finish that then your new creatures yes in christ jesus you see things different the end of 21 there we go you see things different that's why you see things different that's why you act different that's why you see things different you never get customized to this world because you're from above and here is a is a convicting truth you act like the kingdom you belong in if you're acting like the world around you then you're you're you're acting as though that's the world you belong in the kingdom you belong in if you're a part of the kingdom of god you're going to act like citizens of an entirely different kingdom oh come on i'm not talking about being religious i'm talking about being real in the message the future home i'm mentioning this because i want to bring the balance to the born-again thing we have to be born again you've got to be born again if you're not born from above you're lost if you're not born to the water and of the spirit you're not a born-again christian you're not a child of god you have to come that way it's it's a choice there's repentance that has to take place you're baptized you must be baptized but brother branham brings a glorious balance here he said there is your only convocation not have anything to do with the literal things it's beyond that it's into the kingdom of god with eternal life with the predestinated that never did start it never started on any day you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved amen we used to say since calvary and then we had an understanding that calvary paid the price but it started way before calvary in eternity passed in the mind of god he saved his you wasn't saved on any day he was always saved amen jesus just come to redeem that but you were saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with now that places of balance there meaning he already knew who was going to be and potentially in the mind of god you always were but had he not come are you with me had he not come paid the prize i went to bed at 11 o'clock last night it's an amazing amazing thing i just suggest it to all of you then you're awake at six and you're ready to take on the day anybody with me you'd be a whole lot fresher on sunday if you'd get in the bed at a decent time on saturday night somebody said there they are trying to control everything now oh no we're just trying to give you some practical ex reasons to get everything you can get come on like granny said get all you can can't all you get cause one day you're gonna need it jesus just come to redeem that but you were saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with well you may not believe that but with everything i am i believe that i believe i'm saved today because i always was i believe i'm born again today because i yielded to christ coming for me to redeem me he called me and i answered and i chose him i chose him because he chose me that's what the word said matthew 4 23 look at that with me and i'll hurry jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people now i believe that brother branham ministered in a in a dispensation in an era of time where where the truth of god's word was being demonstrated with divine healing in a profound way the son of man is risen with healing in his wings i believe that i believe there were healings on a broader scale among even unbelievers among people who weren't even christian but they heard the simplicity of trust god believe god come and be healed brother john hall an old friend of mine from tucson sends me things all the time i appreciate it so much and he has done a lot of research and he has sent me a multiple multiple advertisements that i've never seen before even though you can find some of them in the in the app i got to look i can't remember what that's called sorry you know you can see what what was today in fact today was i saw where brother gossman posted that today is the day that lifeline is the app i was talking about i saw where today is the day that the ohio river crested just like it was prophesied that it would during the flood that ended up taking uh the life of of uh sister branham and and hope but uh you can go there sometimes and see advertisements of meetings where brother brandon was preaching and i like that i enjoy seeing those brother john hall has done some searching through uh archives and you used to have to do it on micro fish or microfilm but now you can access it online and he'll he'll take it and crop it and send it to me advertisements in various newspapers where brother branham was coming and he also has sent me some where other preachers wanted to have the same success that brother branham was having and so they would they would advertise their ministry as a ministry like william branham now isn't that something that you'd have to draw people to your meeting by by putting in the newspaper come and see a similar gift to william branham now why would somebody want to settle for that if that's the way you were selling it i just want to find where william branham was if it's going to have to be advertised like that but you'd be surprised at some of the ways the churches advertised the meetings and they would just say come come as you are come in whatever condition you are and be healed they didn't say come get saved come join the church come be baptized they just said if you're sick come be healed and you know what they were by the multitudes because it was a time of healing it was the fulfillment of a prophecy of healing the son of man had risen with healing in his wings and catholics and mennonites and all episcopalians and whatever else would come to those meetings and receive healing in their body go right back to their false churches because it was a thing but i want you to know we may not be living in that hour but i want you to also know healing is the children's bread we don't have to say well since this isn't the time of healing we're now over here much farther along in the word then we just have to l no no no no no we should be going after healing for our own bodies and for those we love like we always have because he's the same yesterday and today and forever we should be claiming and believing that we are healed with his stripes even though that may not be the emphasis of this hour how many of you believe he's still a healer how many let me see the hand of those who say they've been healed you you have had god heal you sometime in your life let me see your hand you know he's healed you that he's still the same don't you let anybody talk you out of believing god for whatever you need because jesus went about in all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people and we read a moment ago for the kingdom of god it's not in word but it's in power it's such a powerful truth and in luke 9 give me that one luke 9 1 and 2 i'm not not quite done here but if i cast out devils no excuse me that's uh that is matthew 12 28 i'll get to that one another time luke 9 1-2 then he called his 12 disciples together and gave them power and authority over the low-level devils all devils whoa no wonder they got a little carried away them disciples they had power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases hallelujah and he sent them to preach what the kingdom of god and to heal the sick i want you to think about the condition of the day i want you to think about roman occupation i want you to think about the suffering of the jewish people in this hour as rome had come in to occupy jerusalem and they were trying to turn it into a an entire roman conquest they were going to just make it an off branch of rome they they desired to do to wipe out all judaism you understand they didn't want any anybody carrying on any of the traditions or fulfilling any of the scriptures of the jewish faith they wanted to just wipe it as clean as they possibly could they wanted any any thing that had to do with judaism they wanted to wipe that completely out so the people were very very oppressed and all they knew was what it was like to live in a in a place that was occupied by by the roman kingdom or the roman empire we might use those words interchangeably here and jesus did not come to preach against the roman empire if he had he would have had larger crowds if he would have come to do a trump rally president trump valley if that's if that would have been the theme of his ministry there would have been a whole lot more that came than did come already to come because the people were looking for deliverance from the oppression of the occupying force we want to get out from under rome and if jesus would have come promising all that and and spending all of his time focusing on that then there might have been bigger crowds but how many of you know that wasn't the purpose that he was represented in the earth he didn't come to express that he came to express god and the heart of god for the earth so when he preached he didn't preach against spend all of his time preaching against rome he didn't even spend all of his time preaching against the synagogue although he had to call out on many occasion the hypocrisy and mention specifically those who were of their father the devil he did have to do that in the balance of his preaching but he came to preach the kingdom of god lives are changed when we understand that we're a part of the kingdom of god there's a great contrast between what we know and understand around us and what we carry in us because even in the time of jesus we're told that his kingdom was not with a physical throne in a palace in jerusalem but his kingdom was in the hearts of men the kingdom of god was established in the hearts of men the roman occupation it just kept going on until finally it destroyed the city of jerusalem and burned the holy temple and so forth after christ had already gone so his coming didn't do too much to change the political environment no no no because he wasn't here to preach another political kingdom he was here to preach and demonstrate the kingdom of god and when he sent the disciples forth he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of god and that means their whole focus was not kingdom of heaven because that was a future experience and expression when we get to heaven we know everything's going to be all right i want you to know we're not there yet we got to have something to hope in now we have to have something to hold on to now we need the kingdom of god among us now we need to understand who we are in the kingdom now we need to think like kingdom people now not the kingdom of the earth the kingdom of our god hallelujah so he sent his disciples out to preach the kingdom of god i'm just going to throw this in this is a quote that i slipped in here for you it's from the message the angel of god this is not the only time he said it but i just wanted to reinforce to you what what jesus is demonstrating here by calling men to preach the kingdom he said now god could have sent the angel down couldn't he he could have let the angel come himself but instead of that he sent the angel to speak through the voice read it of a man god always used man for his work is that right he don't use organizations or so forth and mechanical devices but he uses men just say what he said say what he said he uses men now that doesn't mean that we can't have our lives forever changed by hearing god's voice recorded for us on a mechanical device but the debate is getting wilder it's getting wilder out there social media the debate is getting wilder because of the new movement press play and obey and i tell you i want you to know it's getting very very serious because some people are forgetting that the the new testament tells us the only way that the church is going to come to the perfection that she's promised to come to in the last days the only way that's going to happen is because there'll be a fivefold ministry we must have it now we should stay with the word we should stay with the message that god has given us i'm not saying anything contrary to that but we need more than just a recording and we need more than just a machine we need men and women who will live the truth that's been recorded on those machines because everybody's not going to spend the hours that you and i have spent listening to messages everybody's not going to do that until they're until they get it you you suggest someone out there listen to brother branham and you pick one of them three-hour sermons and in all likelihood they don't make it through ten minutes well look at you you can hardly make it through two hours on sunday yourself not like we used to and so they're they're waiting for somebody to live something then you start pointing them to where you ate so good show them what has changed your life give them some of the food that has made you strong in this late hour but god uses men now i hope you'll hear me now i want to close in a few moments with this thought in the message faith in the son of god hammond indiana brother banham said i don't know what the future holds but i know who holds the future that's the main thing i know that he holds all the future and whatever mind shall be it's in his hands so each day i want to live not for myself in the kingdom of men it's dog eat dog and it's nobody cares who they step on climbing the ladder of success but in the kingdom of god we are not living for ourselves we're living for others is that right god help us he said if i live for myself moving on if i live for myself i live a selfish life i want to live for others and give what strength i have not to myself and to my own pleasure read it for me that'll build the kingdom of god living for others will build the kingdom of god how many kingdom builders are here today we all must be a third of us raised our hand but we all must be if we're born into that kingdom then it's our responsibility to help build that kingdom and in order to do so we have to make up our minds i'm no longer going to live for myself to protect my own interests only but i'm going to live for the interest of others come on now yes may god help us to do that it's easy to say and harder to live it out in the mighty conqueror he said you can't conquer by wrong only right will conquer you'll never conquer by cheating you'll never conquer by proselyting in your church you'll never conquer by building up one denomination above another why would you do that they're all corrupt he said you'll only conquer as you let down the bars and let the holy spirit come in to the entire body of christ the limits that you've tried to put on god in this house he's not going to tolerate that forever because he sees a hungry people and when god recognizes a hungry people he has committed himself to meet those people he'll meet you we only conquer as you let down the bars and let the holy spirit come in to the entire body of christ we'll never conquer as long as we're selfish god hates sin and he will not let it triumph over wrong in the message the queen of the south you see what pride and selfishness does it shuts you out from the kingdom of god the kingdom you're born into and yet you allow that selfishness and pride to rise up in your heart and it separates you from the very kingdom of your birth and so to get back to where you were born you have to fight your way back but how many of you know it's worth the fight to kill the pride to defeat the selfishness it's worth it by the grace of god to help us get back to the kingdom where we were born it shuts you out from the kingdom of god he said i wonder sometime as we think what will happen to this generation has that thought ever crossed your mind christ has identified in all generations we all believe in the coming of the lord that is coming as soon at hand we believe it's at hand now we don't know just what time it'll be that he will arrive in view of this we want to put forth every effort that we know how to further the kingdom and get that last person saved into the kingdom one of these days the last one the last one hallelujah the last one is going to hear the call to be born from above and when that last one is saved there will not be one extra it's a number it's a number that we don't know we know exactly how many jewish evangelists will be raised up and sealed in the last day 144 thousand but we have no idea what number will be the last one saved under the gentile dispensation but one day the last one they're going to see it on a program they're going to they're going to hear it in a on youtube they're going to they're gonna find it in a little church somewhere they're gonna work with somebody who's got something who doesn't just talk something but they've got something and they get so hungry they want it and they call out the god [Laughter] they pray through and god says not another one the last one that he had on his mind saved and we're out of here there'll not be one extra it'll just be so many and when that last one is brought in the body of christ is completed the rapture will come if anybody believes that say amen can i read one more two more three more four more a total deliverance i didn't print these out somewhere i dug for them and so for me they're jewels for me every one of them is like gold because it takes a little effort to find them and get them but once i get them oh my i'm happy about them i'm proud of them i am because i think that sometimes he can say it a whole lot better than what i could even try jesus was completely totally man you know this he could cry like a man he could eat like a man he could be tired like a man he was completely totally man in his physical being i want you to hear that again completely totally man in his physical being his flesh was man this is not what everybody teaches and in his spirit he was completely totally god i've heard the apostolics preach that his flesh even his flesh was deity even his flesh was god then he was god god he was a god man he was god living in a man's body why would he do it that way so i would see how possible it really is and in his spirit he was completely totally god so he made his flesh submissive to the spirit that was in him you think jesus is only one sister bonnie that has to do that i just saw your nod and i thought i'd call your name you think he's the only one you think he's the only one that has to do that every one of us have to do that every one of us have to push down the flesh and cause that flesh to be submissive to the will of the spirit or we'd all be holy rollers on sunday morning we'd just roll over stay in the bed you see he was tempted in all manner like we are he was a man not an angel he was a man he had desires and temptations just like we do the bible said he did he was a man not an angel above temptation hebrews 1 said that he was hebrews 1 4 said he was made lower than the angels he was man completely man that god took a complete man to bring total deliverance and he filled him with his spirit the holy ghost was in him without measure the holy ghost was in him without measure and he was tempted like we were you be careful what you say about somebody not having the holy ghost we used to use that on people in pentecost a lot well i thought you had the holy ghost well i thought you had the holy ghost well i thought that was your place to decide parents even sometimes use that on their children it's happened even around here in this church sometime that the young people would have a good service and they'd cry out to the lord and they'd get under the inspiration of the holy ghost and and then they would get under temptation and do something bad before midnight and the parent would say to them i understand the frustration i'm a parent i understand the frustration but then a parent would say something like that to him i thought you got a got the holy ghost i thought you had a good touch from god today i can't believe you're acting that way i want to tell you something that's not the way to discipline your children in fact if you think that's going to cause them to do what you want them to do you're wrong what that's going to do is discourage them from seeking god and let me tell you something it's not an experience or a feeling that's going to get us through but your your your children our young people need to know that they can experience god they can't have an encounter with god and they can feel him we're not living by feeling but it's wonderful to feel the presence of the lord so don't you say to somebody i thought you had the holy ghost you didn't give it somebody said i heard a man speak pretty harshly to his wife and then i heard him speak in tongues in church that couldn't have been god i don't think it's right to speak harshly i'm not saying that at all since i was standing in tucson with sister rebecca and she told me sometime that brother branham could get pretty aggravated with sister meda why because he was a man because he was a human because she got on his nerves i'm preaching that with extra passion aren't i i understand it don't discourage me somebody said well sister rebecca can you remember an example don't you brothers use this as an excuse she said they said sister rebecca can you think of an example of a time that you saw brother branham get very aggravated out of sorts with sister branham and and and speak to her in a harsh way and she said oh yes i can think of many many examples but one that i remember the most would you be willing to tell us they said oh yeah i'll tell you because she said if you know who my daddy was and you understand the ministry god give him it'll it won't it won't shake you either way you'll know he was just a man he struggled like all other men but he got the victory and she said the one i remember is he got real disturbed when my mother burnt his toast no men no men amen we cannot receive any male amens at this moment refrain you'll never hear me say hold your amen but i'm going to tell you hold it right now because you've got to go home with a little wife you know and i thought i'm standing there thinking to myself i can't even fathom that you know why i like extra dark toast the other night we were having a meal for those that were helping work and and and they overcooked some of the rolls or something charity said those are pastors everybody else would have grabbed the other ones but those would have been the one so i can't relate to that but i've got my own ben was that you okay we can have the male amens back i got my own it's not right we need to get the victory over that the greatest thing god has given us other than our salvation is our wife we should treat them with love and respect this is not to justify that nor to to vilify brother branham or delore him in any way it's just to say we have our frustration if anybody had the holy ghost i know he had the holy ghost but he locked his toast a certain way and she went on to tell us that mama had a way of getting him poked and when they were having a little disagreement about something i've noticed the toast would be extra brown the next morning oh you sisters listen she was [Music] let's close she was human too she was that's below the belt she was using toast to get her point across you'd need me more than you realize i'll burn your toast from now on you know jesus had the holy ghost without measure in him and he was tempted like we are like we were and he was completely god tempted in all manner as we are yet without sin come on now understand where i'm coming from he was completely god now let's go on he proved it when he raised the dead when he stopped nature the roaring seas the mighty winds when he spoke to the trees and so forth they obeyed him he was god inside and he could have and he could have been man for he was man but he totally and completely delivered himself as a man into the hands of god for the service of god but that was jesus but jesus is our example well paragraph 88 and he is our example we are men and women we're also christians if he's our example let us completely deliver ourselves into the hands of the holy ghost that we might be subjects of the kingdom of god oh my does that speak to your heart if he's our example let us completely deliver ourselves into the hands of the holy ghost that we might be subjects of the kingdom of god he was totally man he was totally god but he surrendered his natural parts his physical parts his own thinking his own doing his own cares and i don't only i do only that which pleases the father there you are totally delivered from human being the priest come to him the great men and said rabbi so and so and tried to bribe him into their affiliations and denominations but he was totally delivered because he trusted in god believe that paragraph 30. the last one i'll read i'll stop i wanted to get into something else but didn't make it there i have five definite identifications of the true church of the living god he said we have access let the musicians come and help me would you please we have access to our king we have interview with him whenever we want to call upon him we have no intercessors no other intercessors no other mediator between the king and us but that one man christ jesus so we are living in a kingdom i want you to think about what's just read it's wonderful to know that we've reached out to our pastor and he's praying for us but we don't need a mediator we don't need another intercessor this is the greatest kingdom that there has ever been because any little subject in the kingdom has access to the king 24 hours a day 365 days of the year we don't have to go we don't have to go through any other motions go through some long waiting list of the king will see you you know some of you trying to get why people trying to get coveted someone told me yesterday that didn't feel very well said i'm going to get a coverage but couldn't go until next saturday a week later well that didn't make any sense because the cdc tells you now after you've been exposed or had similar you only have five days to quarantine you go back to work remember it was 14 days then it was 10 days now in this long dark dreary deadly winter it's five days come on now scary three weeks ago ninety percent of the cases were in vaccinated people 30 percent of the cases across the board were vaccinated doubly and boosted the truth is this thing is changing so quickly i love to say this to people who don't even look at the any science about it at all and didn't really they must have skipped health in school because they didn't understand anything different about bacteria and virus they don't understand that a virus has intelligence it's like it has a brain it don't it doesn't want to kill you it wants to feast on you it was to make you dinner and so it changes itself to try to keep you alive as a host so it can go somewhere else and eat later think about this so it's not it's there's no there's no doubt there there should be no doubt and and one of the things that's changing it i don't i don't think it's as much the vaccinated people as as i do the natural immune people the people that have already been through it and now carry the antibodies against it i believe we're making a great difference i don't know what i don't know what vaccinated people are doing i don't know if they're making any difference at all that's that's not my my concern but i believe those who've had it and lived through it you're making a difference if you listen to everybody around you you huddle in fear you can't do that but you can't be stupid either you've got to use some wisdom you've got to be careful in this hour as much as possible because you may be fine but you don't want to be responsible in someone else not being fine god help us all we don't want to get caught up in all of that around us we want to know that there's somebody that we can go to you may maybe a week before you can be tested but you don't have to wait a week to go to the king lord i don't know what's going on in my body i don't know if this is a cold or sinus infection or flu or covet or i don't know what it is but i know you do and i know you're my healer i know that you are more than able how many of you like the idea that you can go to the king whenever you need to no other mediator between the king and us but that one man christ jesus so we're living in a kingdom and in and it is called in the chronology of the bible the messianic kingdom i don't know how many times i was going to present it but we'll do it another time i don't know how many times brother branham calls this the messianic kingdom he says the messianic kingdom has come this is where the bride is to be living in a kingdom that is not of this world the messianic kingdom he goes on in other words where the messiah rules in every life in his dominion ruling the lives of his people a called out people from every walk of life gathering them together in a group and calls it his church or his called out ones isn't that a beautiful thing and the congregation says amen paragraph 33 the same message now christ is the head of this christ is the head of this messianic kingdom and you cannot organize the kingdom of which christ is the head 33 of the same message you cannot denominate a kingdom which christ is the head because christ is king and you cannot take the intellectuals of a man and make an organization to which christ will govern therefore any companies any peoples any groups of men that tries to organize the kingdom of god they're going contrary to the king can you say amen to that and if they're going contrary to the king it would be against so it would be against the king so it's against the king it would be an antichrist he said that's pretty rough if i had just a little more voice we'd make that clearer it's an antichrist and if you'll bear with me a few moments i'll prove it an antichrist spirit tries to take a people and call them from organization to organization let's see if we can find this it uh in the list in the in the document it should be i could have left it off somehow but i pretty much drug it over so it should be right after the one we just read in 30. do you see it you do see it all right is it too much pressure if we wait on you are you all twins you always shake your head the same way and they both smile the same way shook their head the same way no i did not did the same way held their hand up the same way it's all right they're sweet help us this way you need to stand up and do jumping jacks real quick you can this one's not long i'll just read it from the start now christ is the head of this christ is the head of this messianic kingdom and you cannot organize the kingdom of which christ is the head you cannot denominate a kingdom which christ is the head because christ is king and you cannot take the intellectuals of a man and make an organization to which christ will govern powerful words therefore any companies any peoples any groups of men that tries to organize the kingdom of god is going contrary to the king and if they're going contrary to the king it would be against the king so if it's against the king it would be an antichrist it's heavy he's speaking about the denominational and religious organization to this earth he said that's pretty rough if i just had a little more voice would make that clearer it is an antichrist and if you'll bear with me a few moments i'll prove that an antichrist spirit tries to take a people and call them from organization to organization organizing them together which never was the will of god people has always fussed at me because i struck so hard at organizations it isn't the people in there that i'm striking at it's that dumb dominating spirit it's that dominating spirit that makes the people think that we are the people there may be a little bit of that around the message paragraph 34 god's people this is called out people i want you to listen carefully i believe they're in every denomination they could be catholic they could be protestant they could be jewish they could be any kind of a church but the real church is the mystical body of jesus christ now don't misunderstand and think that he is suggesting they stay in those places he's calling them called out if you're called out you're called to get out right uh come out of babylon all right but the real church is the mystical body that's it the mystical body of jesus christ let's stand together that's the church that we're called to it's not a church of the of this world or of man's making it's a church of god's election it is an unshakable unmovable kingdom no matter what happens politically in the in the arena of health and wellness and all that's going on and vaccines etc and all the things that are happening around us we're still part of another kingdom a kingdom that cannot be shaken a kingdom that cannot be moved now it's time that we live like that it's time that we manifest that and we can only do that when we choose not to be selfish but we choose to live for others and allow the holy spirit to operate in us for other people brother branham said the gift that he carried was not for himself we recognize that even in his death he unselfishly chose to do the will of the father in the vision experience that god gave me years ago where he took me to the bedroom of brother branham on the night before he left tucson and i saw the clock on the nightstand and i saw sister branham laying there under the cover i saw brother branham by the kneeling by the bed and i heard his prayer like the prayer of john the baptist he said oh lord let me live to see these things god was letting me know that it was the desire of brother branham to live to see everything that he had preached the full manifestation of the sons of god he wanted to be right in the middle of it not just a forerunner but he wanted to experience it and and see the fruit of what he had labored for he said oh lord if at all possible let me live to see this move of god nevertheless not my will lord but your will be done for i must decrease so that you might increase praying the prayers of those before him as much as he wanted to see it he humbled himself to the will of god because everything that we needed to get ready to step into it had been laid up for us and here we are today all these years later still trying to chew on that word so that it will produce in us everything that the kingdom of god has come to this earth for hallelujah and you'd think after all these years that we would have dealt with our selfishness and yet the spirit of god's calling to us this morning find that place in you find that place where you've preferred yourself over somebody else and ask god for grace ask him for grace ask him for grace to live a giving life a life for others lord we are so thankful today that you have translated us from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of your dear son the kingdom of light and lord we are so thankful today for the word of god that you have sent to us and preserved for us and we are daily being changed by that word hallelujah as brother greeley told us today nobody knows like i know you are working in our hearts individually putting your finger on things and we lay them on the altar you put your finger on something else and we lay it on the altar this is the life of a of a believer and though we've been filled with the holy ghost we still face the temptations of living in these bodies of flesh so i thank you lord for your great mercy your tender mercy your long-suffering toward us oh you're ready to forgive us you're ready to give us grace to get through the present circumstance or situation that we battle with lord these are your children here today and they're human beings we're we're just living in a body of flesh and it is our desire to be filled with the fullness of the holy ghost so that no matter what comes our way we can stand in truth and reflect the light so that you might have preeminence in us and that we might see the kingdom of god restored to its rightful position in this earth and all the subjects of this kingdom of god living in service to the king sold out surrendered with the holy ghost fired up generation of young people carrying us forward burning with a passion for personal relationship with you i pray over this body today lord that you would cause every one of us to have a zeal to work to labor to repent to pray for our relationship with you restore it and see it renewed and strengthened may we all god find grace to make it the most important relationship in our lives and spend more effort in building that one strong than we do in any of our other earthly relationships remind us of the importance of walking with you in spirit hallelujah thank you jesus bring us into that spirit to spirit worship where we worship you not out of our flesh we use our flesh as instruments of surrender but but we want a deeper place of worship
