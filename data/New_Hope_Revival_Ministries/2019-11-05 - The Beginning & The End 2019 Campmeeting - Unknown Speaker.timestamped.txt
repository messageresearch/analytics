[31:04] main thing
[31:06] I just desire your prayers tonight the
[31:08] Lord will lead us into his word and it
[31:10] was a great confirmation to me last
[31:12] night to see brother Brooks come in and
[31:14] just come right in the same channel with
[31:17] us and I just I've been preaching on
[31:20] some things there at the home church and
[31:23] I I didn't want to bring those things
[31:25] unless the Lord wanted me to I just come
[31:27] neutral seek him for the leadership of
[31:29] the Lord but as we walked out those
[31:32] doors last other night we didn't know
[31:34] exactly what was going to go with but
[31:37] the Lord took control amen
[31:39] and the Lord vindicated the two last
[31:41] night and settled me he meant to know
[31:44] everything's gonna be alright now we're
[31:46] Christians right so if you turn over to

[37:20] being ready is that right Amen it's
[37:23] remaining in you you also shall continue
[37:27] in the son now I know why a lot of
[37:29] people is not continuing amen is because
[37:32] they're not interested in the word
[37:34] anymore hey man
[37:36] it's not continuing in them so then they
[37:39] lose their desires is that right amen so
[37:42] what is it hearing from the beginning
[37:44] what is it that gives that's that's so
[37:47] powerful about it because he says if
[37:49] you've heard from the beginning and then
[37:51] let it remain as Elkin you shall
[37:53] continue so there's something that'll
[37:56] give us something amen
[37:57] that'll help us to continue is that
[37:59] right amen so we could think about this
[38:02] that hearing from the beginning and it
[38:05] gives us some kind of a super strength
[38:08] hey man praise the Lord it gives us a
[38:11] super strength
[38:12] amen of a quickening power a mint that
[38:16] helps us to continue and the mania
[38:19] started the race mineus run the race but
[38:22] there be few that'll finish the race is
[38:25] that right Amen you know it there's no
[38:27] even used to think about starting the
[38:29] race if you're not going to finish it is
[38:31] that right Amen hallelujah a champion
[38:34] Amen will start the race and he'll win
[38:37] the race is that right Amen and I say we
[38:41] we have been introduced to the champion
[38:43] tonight hallelujah amen and I want to
[38:47] tell you God has never lost a battle
[38:49] he's never lost a battle amen and I tell
[38:54] you amen only the battle that the devil
[38:56] ever lost is when he come up against God
[38:59] Amen is our eye and I want to tell you
[39:01] who's on the Lord's side tonight among
[39:04] us is going to be the ones that's going
[39:07] to fight the fight is gonna be the one
[39:09] that won't give in to the devil it's
[39:11] gonna finish the race by the help of the
[39:14] Lord Amen hallelujah so I'm looking for
[39:17] a meant to see you amongst us Amen don't
[39:20] cross the finish line
[39:21] amen honey I want to see you Amen I want
[39:25] to be here at the finish line right I
[39:27] mean so when we go back to the beginning
[39:29] and listen to that beginning word we're
[39:34] going to hear from our theophany because
[39:38] the prophet of God says we bypassed our
[39:41] theophany is that right so we got to
[39:44] figure out why
[39:44] there's so much power in going back to
[39:47] the beginning because we gotta have the
[39:49] revelation the understanding what the
[39:52] Prophet said when he said we bypassed
[39:55] our theophany it wasn't our fault
[39:58] Amen but we did it for a reason is that
[40:01] right so we could come down into this
[40:03] falling to stay into this power into
[40:06] this body into this weak vessel and to
[40:09] realize ami we need a Savior we need a
[40:13] healer we need somebody to save us
[40:16] is that right amen hallelujah and I
[40:18] thank God that He has allowed us to be
[40:21] able to do that because now I know what
[40:24] a mighty God we serve now I know what
[40:27] he's done for me amen hallelujah and so
[40:30] we realized when we go back we're going
[40:32] back to where our theophany was well I
[40:36] like to hear about that don't you I mean
[40:38] we're going back to where we bypassed
[40:41] something and so what I realize is when
[40:44] we that theophany is a word body it's a
[40:48] word body and do you realize every one
[40:51] of us has got a theophany
[40:52] every one of us has got a theophany
[40:55] every believer has got a theophany body
[40:58] glory to God and when you're hearing the
[41:01] word you're hearing from your theophany
[41:04] a believer a Christian cannot die praise
[41:08] the Lord Amen he's already dead Amen he
[41:12] died on his second birth praise the Lord
[41:14] Amen he died and he received on you
[41:17] birth and now he's a believer and he
[41:20] cannot die he died the death of the
[41:23] nature that was in him but now he's
[41:25] picking up the life of God and the
[41:28] prophet of God winner and he says he
[41:30] when he hears when he receives that
[41:32] Spirit of God he is now hearing from his
[41:35] theophany hallelujah praise the Lord and
[41:40] so tonight I say let's hear from our
[41:43] theophany let's tap into something that
[41:46] we may have not been tapping into
[41:48] something I'm looking for a change or at
[41:51] you I'm looking for some
[41:53] and I'd like to get in a science lab and
[41:55] be able to explore find something that's
[41:58] powerful a meant something that can do
[42:01] something
[42:02] Amen hollow that the world ain't got a
[42:04] hold of yet amen
[42:06] and so we realized that when we are
[42:08] hearing from the beginning I believe if
[42:11] we could go back into Genesis there and
[42:13] we see what God had in his plan he man
[42:17] will realize see man how great our God
[42:19] is a man and there'll be a never place
[42:22] in our life that we'll ever get angry
[42:24] with God will never get upset with God
[42:27] we'll be okay with God's plan hey man is
[42:31] that right amen and so that's the reason
[42:34] we took you to Enoch just other night
[42:37] amen because Enoch was interested is
[42:41] that right
[42:42] and we realized Adam lived 930 years
[42:46] that's a long time so he got to see a
[42:48] lot of generations come up and some
[42:51] maybe we would just refresh your memory
[42:54] maybe some of some of visitors maybe or
[42:57] someone some of you don't know about
[42:58] Enoch but in Genesis chapter 5 it says
[43:03] in Enoch he says he lived sixty and five
[43:07] years and and he says and begot
[43:11] Methuselah and Methuselah was the oldest
[43:13] one in the Bible and it says and Enoch
[43:16] walked with God after he begat
[43:19] Methuselah three hundred years and begat
[43:21] sons and daughters and all the days of
[43:23] Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five
[43:25] years and Enoch walked with God and he
[43:28] was not for God took him and so that's
[43:33] that's explosive right there and when we
[43:37] got to find out it men if we want to be
[43:40] an anak amen that we could tap into what
[43:43] Enoch was tapping in amen and so we can
[43:46] think about Adam was still alive when
[43:49] Enoch was alive and we could think Adam
[43:52] was in our great great great great
[43:54] grandpa maybe but there's something
[43:57] about Enoch that he was interested in
[44:00] from hearing about
[44:03] because he knew that Adam was the first
[44:06] man upon the earth
[44:08] now to the other cousins and the other
[44:11] boys maybe that wasn't interested in
[44:13] them amen but something in this man was
[44:16] interesting a man is that right
[44:18] everybody could call him grandpa
[44:21] but Enoch says this is more than grandpa
[44:23] this is the first man his daddy was gone
[44:27] and that just amazes me George say
[44:30] something about this word that amazes me
[44:33] but there's nothing in the world that
[44:36] gets my attention like this word does I
[44:38] hope that's in us all here tonight we
[44:42] could be at a lot of places but were
[44:43] drawn to the word and it says the Eagles
[44:47] are gathered around the carcass is that
[44:50] right and so I believe the children of
[44:53] God are Eagles and we're concerned about
[44:55] the word and so we realized the ena took
[45:00] he says we could think about Enoch he
[45:04] could go down to his grandpa grandpa
[45:06] great great great Grandpa's house and he
[45:08] could go down to Adams tent and have
[45:10] fellowship with him and because he was
[45:13] interested in hearing about that
[45:15] beginning a many stirred up something
[45:19] like a magnet drawling him him every day
[45:24] he got to hear more and the more he
[45:27] heard the more he wanted I pray that's
[45:30] the way you are the more you hear about
[45:32] this learn the more it stirs a craving
[45:35] you is that right
[45:37] and so it stirs something in him and so
[45:40] we're looking at Enoch he's going back
[45:42] amen and hearing something that was in
[45:45] the beginning praise the Lord
[45:47] he's got somebody that was in the
[45:50] beginning that can tell him what it was
[45:52] about
[45:53] right Oh church it's good to have
[45:56] something that'll take you back to the
[45:58] beginning raise the Lord is that right
[46:01] Amen somebody that was there somebody
[46:03] could tell you what it was about oh my
[46:06] Amen I told you how to deny all the
[46:08] things that Adam was that were not here
[46:12] he had never had a Batman Murray he
[46:14] never had a negative
[46:16] running through his mind he just come
[46:18] alive and he was there amen everything
[46:21] was perfect in his life so different
[46:25] from us because of the fall was that
[46:28] right but Enoch was stirred by the
[46:30] relationship of God coming down and
[46:33] talking to ena I stirred in his heart
[46:37] and it he wanted that is that right
[46:40] so we could say Enoch was hearing from
[46:43] the beginning but see I'm not here to
[46:46] take you back
[46:47] I meant God is never taking us back he's
[46:51] taking us forward so Enoch could go and
[46:54] hear the word of the beginning and he
[46:57] could bring it up into his day to his
[47:00] house Amen right to his street corner
[47:03] right to his church amen and preach that
[47:06] same word Amen not going back but going
[47:10] forward with what he heard from the
[47:13] beginning Enoch wasn't trying to get in
[47:18] the garden he was trying to get that
[47:21] fellowship again Oh Church wouldn't you
[47:24] like to have that fellowship with God
[47:26] every day just talking with the Lord hey
[47:31] man that's why we're here tonight have
[47:34] that fellowship with the Lord and so
[47:36] Enoch took that and went forward with
[47:38] that desire of fellowship with God and
[47:41] so we understand that when he was taking
[47:43] that revelation when he was hearing he
[47:45] was building that pyramid by what he was
[47:49] hearing and that pyramid became the
[47:51] second Bible he means that right the
[47:54] stars in the sky was the first God's
[47:57] first Bible and then he said that
[47:59] pyramid became God's second Bible and we
[48:03] realized when God destroyed the earth
[48:04] the only thing that was standing was the
[48:07] pyramid he said heavens and earth will
[48:10] pass away but my word will not pass away
[48:14] everything was destroyed in Noah's day
[48:16] except for the pinna I mean the pyramid
[48:19] why because that was he knocks
[48:21] revelation
[48:22] that he heard from the beginning and it
[48:24] stood the whole earth was destroyed but
[48:27] that were stood there in his dog today
[48:29] it's in the perfect place that it never
[48:32] casts a shadow a supernatural church
[48:36] that's powerful where did he get that
[48:39] knowledge he got it from the beginning
[48:42] is that right so we see that Enoch was
[48:46] picking up his theophany he was hearing
[48:49] from his word that word theophany amen
[48:52] in he was taking it home and built an
[48:54] opponent it became something greater
[48:56] than what the garden was hmm so that's
[49:04] what I'm trying to show you tonight the
[49:07] title of the message tonight he saved
[49:08] the best for last
[49:10] okay God's not taking us backwards he's
[49:14] taking us for church we're not trying to
[49:17] get in the garden amen
[49:20] we're trying to get in the fellowship
[49:22] with God is that right and I'll prove
[49:25] some of these things here tonight by the
[49:27] scriptures amen and and then so Enoch
[49:31] became heavenly instead of earthly is
[49:36] that right he was walking earthly but he
[49:39] was hearing from the beginning and while
[49:41] he was on the earth God was raising him
[49:43] up and raising him up he was walking
[49:45] with God and then one day he was not
[49:48] because God took him there I and that's
[49:53] what we're doing Amy we're walking with
[49:55] God every day and God has taken us up up
[49:59] up is that right
[50:00] amen and so we see that you don't took
[50:03] the word from the beginning and
[50:05] possessed it and became something better
[50:08] Adam was still a man on the earth but
[50:12] Enoch had something better that it took
[50:15] him off the earth is that right
[50:19] Adam had that fellowship but Enoch took
[50:22] that same fellowship walk with God and
[50:25] it took him up praise the Lord
[50:28] so we're looking for something better
[50:30] all
[50:31] time it's going to get better they
[50:34] thought it's not a god of getting worse
[50:36] god is the god of getting better praise
[50:39] the Lord he don't want you sick he said
[50:41] I want you to prosper and be in good
[50:43] health
[50:43] he said I'll heal you of all manner
[50:46] diseases that doesn't mean that we won't
[50:48] get the sickness that means we'll get
[50:50] diseases but he's going to heal us of
[50:52] all of those things so we got to be
[50:54] willing to get it so he can shows that
[50:57] he's a healer of it hey man praise the
[51:00] Lord amen
[51:02] so we think about that how great that is
[51:05] a man from general Isaac 41 4 says who
[51:10] hath wrought and done it he's calling
[51:12] the generations from the beginning I the
[51:15] Lord the first and with the last I am he
[51:19] so let's think about a skinner fault
[51:21] here tonight here from the beginning but
[51:24] he's saving the best for the last
[51:26] 1st Peter 1 9 through 12 it says
[51:29] receiving the end of your faith even the
[51:33] salvation of your souls of which
[51:36] salvation the prophets have inquired and
[51:39] searched diligently who prophesied of
[51:43] the grace that should come not into them
[51:46] but unto us something better coming to
[51:50] us is that right searching war what
[51:53] manner of the time of the Spirit of
[51:55] Christ which was in them did signify
[51:57] when it testified before hand the
[52:01] sufferings of Christ and the glory that
[52:03] should follow unto whom it was revealed
[52:06] that not unto themselves but unto us
[52:10] they didn't minister the things which
[52:13] are now reported unto you by them that
[52:17] have preached the gospel unto you with
[52:19] the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven
[52:21] which things the angels desire to look
[52:24] into Wow even the angels are looking for
[52:30] something to come and to look into is
[52:34] that right amen
[52:38] Hebrews 11 39 through 40 it says and
[52:42] these all talking about the Old
[52:43] Testament
[52:44] things and this is the faith chapter all
[52:47] these warriors all these heroes of faith
[52:49] having obtained a good report through
[52:52] faith received not the promise God
[52:56] having provided some better thing for us
[53:00] that they without us should not be made
[53:06] perfect right as the brother says the
[53:09] earth is groaning waiting for the
[53:12] manifestations of the sons of God oh
[53:16] there's a perfect coming church I want
[53:19] to say the perfect is here it's time to
[53:22] realize we're got something that'll make
[53:25] us perfect amen
[53:28] Johnson no longer winking that Wigner's
[53:30] Church his words been poured out in this
[53:31] endtime he means that right talking
[53:34] about the last days in a moment of
[53:36] twinkling of an eye at the last Trump
[53:38] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[53:41] shall be raised incorruptible and we
[53:44] shall be changed so there's a promise
[53:46] just like Enoch had Amen that something
[53:50] took him amen
[53:52] so in the last days we're gonna hear
[53:54] something that's going to take us back
[53:55] to the beginning and give us that
[53:58] fellowship with God ain't meant that
[54:00] it's going to raise us up out of here
[54:02] just like Enoch did and I'm gonna
[54:08] believe that I'm gonna be one of them
[54:09] that's gonna take out of here one of
[54:12] these days I see the signs all around us
[54:15] telling this it's time to go home is
[54:18] that right hallelujah first Peter 1:20
[54:23] just getting you're getting your
[54:24] thoughts up on this better whoo verily
[54:27] was foreordained before the foundation
[54:29] of the world but was manifested in the
[54:35] last times for you in other words not
[54:41] everybody not every age is gonna have
[54:43] the revelation that we have in this last
[54:46] stage of what God's whole purpose is so
[54:50] I scriptures I'm pretty happy Amen that
[54:55] I'm living in this day
[54:56] were they in the last church age we're
[54:59] in living in the last days amen
[55:01] hallelujah amen this is the best of the
[55:03] best you say bye brother Darren do you
[55:06] realize how gross darkness is it is out
[55:09] there I say absolutely I agree with you
[55:11] but I tell you the more darker it is the
[55:14] more you shine the more the light of God
[55:17] shines and I say it's time to be light
[55:20] it's time to show that we're some Enochs
[55:23] here that's going to take a rapture
[55:26] glory to God
[55:28] is that right now let's come on up to
[55:33] Jesus's day okay and so we're talking
[55:37] about possessing not going back but
[55:41] going hearing from the beginning and
[55:43] possessing in that day so we spoke about
[55:47] Jesus when he comes up in his day and we
[55:50] got all of these religious people that
[55:52] thinks they're all right where they're
[55:53] at and then they come with him with amen
[55:56] some of the things that Moses allowed
[55:58] them to do and they says Moses allowed
[56:01] us to put away our lives for any calls
[56:03] right amen hallelujah for any calls to
[56:07] put away amen and Jesus come he says but
[56:10] Moses did it for the hardness of your
[56:12] hearts
[56:13] he wasn't messed up in marriage and
[56:15] divorce friends he was just a man
[56:18] hallelujah amen having to deal with
[56:20] everybody's problems that didn't want to
[56:22] live the word and he was allowing these
[56:25] things to take place but here comes the
[56:27] word the second Adam and he says but it
[56:31] was not so in the beginning
[56:33] oh brother Amy he didn't kind of just
[56:36] let us go on him in in our own day a day
[56:39] of confusion he picked us back to the
[56:42] beginning
[56:43] Jesus pick us back to the beginning of
[56:46] the first marriage in the Bible and said
[56:48] this man loved his wife Amy she came out
[56:52] of him and he she was part of him he
[56:55] didn't want to put her away he wanted a
[56:57] library keeper right have you thought
[57:03] about where you come from
[57:04] any born-again believer has come out of
[57:07] Christ here man
[57:10] raise the Lord and he's gonna take any
[57:12] kind of excuse to put us away he's
[57:15] wanting to keep us but I like that he
[57:18] took him back to the beginning and said
[57:20] it wasn't so in the beginning is that
[57:23] right amen see he took us back to the
[57:28] beginning and possessed the truth to
[57:31] bring it back to a man and his wife a
[57:33] man
[57:34] we're to possessing the truth Church a
[57:36] man it's funny how we can go on up the
[57:39] road and lose contact with the truth but
[57:42] if we'll go back to what the beginning
[57:45] said go back what God said in the
[57:47] beginning it'll practice it'll get us
[57:50] straight now
[57:51] he said teach your children to teach
[57:53] their children to pitch their children
[57:54] the truth amen I'd like for you to turn
[57:59] over with me into John chapter 2 you
[58:07] love him
[58:08] the man is good to us
[58:19] I hope you enjoy this I've read this
[58:28] story over and over but until just the
[58:31] other day I really got something
[58:33] revealed to me stirred my heart verse 1
[58:40] and the third day there was a marriage
[58:44] in Cana of Galilee and the mother Jesus
[58:48] was there and both Jesus was called and
[58:52] his disciples were called to what to a
[58:57] marriage
[58:58] and when they wanted wine the mother of
[59:02] Jesus said in him they have no wine
[59:07] jesus said in her woman what have I do
[59:11] with thee to do with thee mine hour is
[59:15] not yet come his mother said unto the
[59:18] servants whatsoever he says to you do it
[59:21] and there were set there six waterpots
[59:25] of stone after the manner of the
[59:29] purifying of the Jews containing two or
[59:31] three firkins apiece so let's get this
[59:41] so we're come to a marriage here and the
[59:45] custom is is when they come into this
[59:48] marriage they bring out the good wine
[59:50] that they God write and then as they
[59:55] begin the drink and you can't drink one
[59:58] and keep drinking it without a little
[1:00:00] bit of stimulation starting to come
[1:00:02] right amen praise the Lord
[1:00:06] this word is stimulation and when you
[1:00:10] start hearing from the beginning it
[1:00:11] starts stimulating is that right Amy and
[1:00:15] so they begin the drink and and the
[1:00:18] custom was that after they begin to
[1:00:20] drink the good wine then they started
[1:00:22] slowly bringing in the junky wine
[1:00:27] right amen because they got a little
[1:00:30] stimulated so they could sneak it in on
[1:00:33] them and they weren't quite notice it
[1:00:35] right do you realize that's what the
[1:00:38] devil is doing through the churches
[1:00:40] today they get a little bit of word
[1:00:44] thinking they got everything they need
[1:00:45] and then the slewfoot a devil begins to
[1:00:50] bring in all his mass all of his
[1:00:53] perversion and and they're already drunk
[1:00:56] on the things amen hallelujah they don't
[1:00:59] notice what the devil is big doing to
[1:01:02] them and the devil seducing them so
[1:01:05] right we'll all kinds of false doctrine
[1:01:07] different things is that right amen
[1:01:10] that's what the devil can do amen but we
[1:01:12] see that when when they begin to get
[1:01:14] stimulated on the good wine then they
[1:01:16] start bringing all out the the worse and
[1:01:19] and so evidently they had had enough
[1:01:22] marriages evidently in that year that
[1:01:25] they had run out of the bad wine they
[1:01:29] had gifts so much of the worst wine out
[1:01:31] that they didn't have no more bad wine
[1:01:33] to run it right they had run out of the
[1:01:37] worst of the worst well I want to tell
[1:01:39] you we're living in the day amen the
[1:01:42] worst is here Satan has got the whole
[1:01:45] worse out here hell is enlarged itself
[1:01:49] it's here the whole world is full of
[1:01:52] corruption is that right MA
[1:01:57] praise the Lord it's terrible the hour
[1:01:59] we're living it so they had run out of
[1:02:02] it and so Jesus is just sitting there
[1:02:06] like anybody else and so they call Tony
[1:02:12] his mother's trying to get something
[1:02:14] done here and so Jesus just quietly gets
[1:02:18] up maybe he goes in the basement where
[1:02:21] these pots are and there's water laying
[1:02:25] there and he secretly does a work over
[1:02:30] this
[1:02:30] Zehra and so
[1:02:34] he prays over this or whatever he does
[1:02:36] and then Olsen is turned into wine
[1:02:40] right so all those men that's standing
[1:02:44] there saying what's this stranger doing
[1:02:45] and they looking at water and then all
[1:02:48] sudden it's red its wine hey hey this is
[1:02:53] amazing
[1:02:54] how'd it go from that to this it skipped
[1:02:57] all the process and maybe the guy took
[1:03:00] his finger dipped it into it was a wow
[1:03:03] this does already fermented it
[1:03:06] this stuff's already stout and strong
[1:03:09] and skip all the process
[1:03:12] it just went water to wine blow it ago a
[1:03:16] mint so they they Jesus goes back sets
[1:03:19] down in his chair like you know just
[1:03:21] nothing has done and so they bring it up
[1:03:23] and enter the ruler of the house amen
[1:03:26] they they grab the drink in the cases of
[1:03:29] it and he says hey here I gotta say

[1:03:43] of the time when we do these things he

[1:04:12] corner that has something to do with it
[1:04:15] it's the man that could create it's the
[1:04:18] man that knowed the beginning to the end
[1:04:20] the match was different this time
[1:04:22] because there was somebody in their
[1:04:25] house that knew how to do things I'm
[1:04:30] telling you we're in a marriage today
[1:04:32] you're getting married to Jesus here and
[1:04:35] we're going to emerge Supper is that
[1:04:39] right
[1:04:39] amen and I tell you God has been giving
[1:04:42] us wine
[1:04:43] and we started out in Genesis with good
[1:04:46] revelation praise the Lord Amen but
[1:04:49] there's a lot of things begin to happen
[1:04:50] from Genesis all the way up I mean even
[1:04:54] got destroyed it because the imagination
[1:04:56] of men's minds he got bad he got bad
[1:04:59] this and that this and that but when
[1:05:02] Jesus came along a man he started taking
[1:05:05] this back to the beginning he said it
[1:05:07] was not so from the beginning
[1:05:10] oh brother he was bringing some new
[1:05:12] revelation out he's bringing some new
[1:05:15] wine out to the people it's time to get
[1:05:18] stimulated it's time to get drunk on the
[1:05:23] Word of God is that right it got so real
[1:05:27] that when the people were in the upper
[1:05:29] room amen hallelujah staring they got
[1:05:32] drunk on the revelation of God and
[1:05:35] beginning a stagger like drunk man
[1:05:37] prophesy a mean speaking languages that
[1:05:40] was not in her own time they got drunk
[1:05:43] because of the new wine and the Bible
[1:05:46] says we can't put new wine in old
[1:05:48] bottles praise the Lord
[1:05:50] sons gonna happen if we do I want to
[1:05:53] tell you touch this D wine Amen polities

[1:06:04] stuff back hell it's time to get the new
[1:06:06] revelation God's pouring out in this in

[1:06:15] some that we're here for in the
[1:06:17] beginning that's going to take us
[1:06:18] through our theophany Alleluia is that
[1:06:23] right
[1:06:24] amen he saved the best for last I like
[1:06:29] that hey man it's not that they kept the
[1:06:38] good wine it's the last it's because
[1:06:42] Jesus was there Zehra man had nothing to
[1:06:45] do with this wine it was the true
[1:06:48] creator turning back his grapes
[1:06:52] back to one rah hey hey man we're not
[1:06:56] hearing from a man's religion in this
[1:06:58] hour we're not living in a reforming age
[1:07:01] that this man had something to do with
[1:07:04] in this man we have been restored back
[1:07:07] amen hallelujah and the Genesis or a
[1:07:10] revelation chapter five
[1:07:12] no one was worthy to open the book amen
[1:07:16] nobody Enoch nobody could stand up and
[1:07:18] take the book had a man said right and
[1:07:21] he said I well crime who is worthy and
[1:07:24] then he said I heard a voice behind me
[1:07:27] saying Amen behold the line of tribe of
[1:07:29] Judah had prevail
[1:07:31] I mean he's turned and looked and that
[1:07:33] was a lamp Ryanair and what's it a four
[1:07:36] legged lamb it was that land that John
[1:07:38] saw I'm Caffrey amen dying his blood
[1:07:42] pouring out Oh brothers and sisters it
[1:07:45] stimulated John in order to stimulate us
[1:07:50] this whole Bible through the ages is
[1:07:52] being closed but now it's open hey man
[1:07:57] hallelujah has become a new Bible to us
[1:08:01] revelation after revelation is pouring
[1:08:03] out to us is that right amen we're
[1:08:09] hearing from the beginning so the batter
[1:08:17] what is it the best for last
[1:08:20] hey man let's turn over to John 1:1
[1:08:32] when you get that hold your place and
[1:08:34] turn over to Genesis 1 let's look at
[1:08:47] Genesis 1 in the beginning going back to
[1:08:54] the beginning in the beginning God
[1:08:56] created the heaven and the earth huh
[1:09:00] so he's saying in the beginning who God
[1:09:03] created what the heaven and the earth
[1:09:07] yeah right and he tells us how the earth
[1:09:10] was looking over to John 1:1 it says in
[1:09:14] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:09:20] was with God call now if we go to
[1:09:26] Genesis 1 it just takes us back to the
[1:09:29] heavens and the earth but if we go John
[1:09:31] 1:1 here and he says in the beginning
[1:09:34] was the word it's still the same thing
[1:09:37] it's not contradicting but it's a little
[1:09:40] bit more detailed
[1:09:41] is that right amen John 1:1 is a little
[1:09:45] bit more detailed than Genesis 1 even
[1:09:47] though that's the seat chapter that's
[1:09:50] the beginning but John 1:1 is give us
[1:09:52] just a little bit more further back and
[1:09:55] he says in the beginning was the word
[1:09:56] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:09:59] was God the same was in the beginning
[1:10:02] with God is that right praise the Lord
[1:10:06] but it gets better than the night it
[1:10:10] gets better than that because God is not
[1:10:13] just send us a man in this day he sent a
[1:10:15] prophet and a prophet is born the
[1:10:17] Prophet and a prophet is a seer and he
[1:10:20] can see where there's far as God lets
[1:10:23] him see or you can see way back there as
[1:10:25] far God would allow him to see and see
[1:10:29] amen God says I will do nothing except I
[1:10:32] reveal utley my service the prophets
[1:10:34] I mean so they are our eyes they are
[1:10:38] eyes to see whatever the prophecies
[1:10:41] because nothing will be revealed to us
[1:10:44] unless it comes through the Prophet God
[1:10:48] never done anything with the childress
[1:10:50] or unless he done it with Moses or
[1:10:52] unless he did it with Joshua is that
[1:10:54] right amen Moses was God's force to
[1:10:58] those people and if God would send us a
[1:11:02] prophet in our day his eyes as our eyes
[1:11:05] his voice is what we're hearing the
[1:11:08] words of God is that right hey man so
[1:11:12] I'm not ashamed to say that God has sent
[1:11:14] us a prophet in this day and I'm not
[1:11:18] ashamed to say he saved the best for
[1:11:21] last
[1:11:24] if I could take you back in the
[1:11:26] questions answers in 1953 you lied to
[1:11:30] 29th he begins to speak like this he
[1:11:37] said the first creation was God himself
[1:11:43] then out of God came the logos I didn't
[1:11:50] hear nothing about logos then out of the
[1:11:55] logos which was the word and the word
[1:11:58] was made flesh into one among us listen
[1:12:01] this he says oh I got a beautiful
[1:12:04] picture in my mind now oh you're ready
[1:12:09] to go back into the beginning amen let
[1:12:15] this remain in you if you could take a
[1:12:18] little trip with me I believe I've
[1:12:21] talked on it before but to get this to
[1:12:23] the place where you be sure to see it
[1:12:25] now let's take a little trip and go back
[1:12:27] for a little while don't think about how
[1:12:29] hard it is or our minds right on what
[1:12:31] everything's going on let's go back a
[1:12:33] hundred million years before there was
[1:12:35] ever a star moon or anything that's
[1:12:40] before Genesis and one
[1:12:43] hey man praise the Lord this bride in
[1:12:48] this last day's getting ready take a
[1:12:50] trip before and go past Genesis 1 and go
[1:12:54] father this is going to do something for
[1:12:57] the Bride of Christ well we're going to
[1:13:00] go back into the thoughts of God where
[1:13:02] we was in the thoughts of his thoughts
[1:13:06] where did we come from out of the
[1:13:09] thoughts of God he said our names were
[1:13:11] on the lens book of life before the
[1:13:13] foundation of the world that's before
[1:13:16] Genesis 1 church amen
[1:13:18] I'm going to go back now to where my
[1:13:20] name was in his book hallelujah he said
[1:13:25] let's go back a hundred million years
[1:13:28] before there was ever a star a moon or
[1:13:29] anything in the world now there was a
[1:13:31] time when there wasn't nothing here it
[1:13:34] was just all forever and eternity and
[1:13:38] all ever and eternity was God he was
[1:13:41] there in the beginning he said let's go
[1:13:44] out on the edge of this banister and
[1:13:46] look over and see these things happen no
[1:13:50] man has seen the father at any time no
[1:13:53] man see God in the body form because God
[1:13:58] is not in a body form God is a spirit
[1:14:02] all right no man has seen the father but
[1:14:05] the only begotten of the father had
[1:14:07] declared him now but notice now there's
[1:14:10] nothing there's just space there's no
[1:14:14] light there's no dark there's no nothing
[1:14:17] it just seems nothing that's way back
[1:14:20] friends but in there is a great
[1:14:23] supernatural being Jehovah God who
[1:14:26] covered all space of all places at all
[1:14:29] times he was from everlasting to
[1:14:32] everlasting he is the beginning of
[1:14:34] creation that's God can't see nothing
[1:14:37] can't hear nothing not a move an atom in
[1:14:40] the air
[1:14:41] nothing amen but yet God was there that
[1:14:45] was God he said now let's watch for a
[1:14:48] few minutes and no man has seen that he
[1:14:51] says no notice then after a while I
[1:14:53] begin to see a little sacred
[1:14:57] I begin to form like a little halo or
[1:15:00] something you ever seen a halo a real
[1:15:03] one you could only see it by spiritual
[1:15:07] eyes to look now while we're looking the
[1:15:10] whole church now we're standing on a
[1:15:12] great big banister watching what God's
[1:15:14] doing you say I don't see it well I'm
[1:15:17] telling you about it's a prophet telling
[1:15:20] you so you can see it so you know yeah I
[1:15:24] gotta say Lord let me see let me have
[1:15:27] eyes to see let me have ears to hear I'm
[1:15:32] interested see it's just like that the
[1:15:35] boy on the street corner he wasn't
[1:15:37] interested in Jesus because he was in
[1:15:39] love with other things I said but I met
[1:15:42] Jesus I was like you I met Jesus and now
[1:15:45] I'm interested
[1:15:46] you can't help be interested until you
[1:15:48] meet him and then if you meet him and
[1:15:50] you like it
[1:15:51] a mint then you were interested see some
[1:15:54] of this might not be interesting to you
[1:15:55] but if you ever meet Jesus and want to
[1:15:58] know where you come from you're gonna be
[1:16:00] interested in this
[1:16:01] is that right and when you're interested
[1:16:04] it's gonna remain in you to the coming
[1:16:06] of the Lord amen
[1:16:09] so he says and after a while I begin to
[1:16:12] see a little sacred light begin to form
[1:16:14] a little halo he said you could only see
[1:16:17] it by spiritual eyes I hope you got them
[1:16:21] tonight to look now while we're looking
[1:16:24] he said we're standing on a great big
[1:16:26] banister watching what God's doing and
[1:16:28] we'll get right down to this question
[1:16:30] here and you'll see how he brings it in
[1:16:32] now no one has seen God and he says we
[1:16:37] see this little white light forming out
[1:16:39] here what is that that was called by
[1:16:42] Bible readers logos or the anointing or
[1:16:47] the anointing that's what we read in
[1:16:50] John 2 there about that unknown him amen
[1:16:54] and he says and God began to develop
[1:16:58] into something so human beings could
[1:17:01] have some type of an idea what it was it
[1:17:04] was a little light moving
[1:17:07] he was that word of God and he said now
[1:17:11] God gave himself birth to his son which
[1:17:15] was before there was even an atom God's
[1:17:18] giving birth
[1:17:21] he said the lamb was slain before the
[1:17:23] foundation of the world your names were
[1:17:26] planted in the lenzburg life before the
[1:17:28] foundation or God's making a plan of you
[1:17:31] and me before the beginning of creation
[1:17:34] earth he said before the bride leaves
[1:17:38] here she'll know where she come from who
[1:17:41] she is and where she's going and this is
[1:17:44] the way we're going to know he said God
[1:17:48] was giving birth to his son which before
[1:17:50] there was even the Adam before iyer to
[1:17:53] make an Adam Jesus said glory find me
[1:17:56] father with the glory that we had before
[1:17:58] the foundation in the world Jesus was
[1:18:01] going back to the beginning when he was
[1:18:03] fixing the die for his friends he said
[1:18:06] glory find me Lord with the glory that I
[1:18:08] have with you in the beginning we can
[1:18:11] say that same prayer Lord gloy found me
[1:18:15] with what you had with me in the
[1:18:17] beginning
[1:18:17] Oh amen he said Jesus said glorify me
[1:18:23] follow with the glory we had before the
[1:18:24] foundation world see way back in yonder
[1:18:27] now back there win this little halo
[1:18:30] combs we can't see nothing but just by
[1:18:34] eyes of just supernatural we see a halo
[1:18:38] standing there and that's the Son of God
[1:18:41] the logos and I can see him playing
[1:18:44] around like a little child before the
[1:18:46] father's door with all eternity
[1:18:49] Oh hallelujah the family was their
[1:18:52] church and now then in his imaginary
[1:18:55] makeup he began to think of what things
[1:18:58] would be and I can hear say let there be
[1:19:01] light
[1:19:03] and when he did and Adam bursted and the
[1:19:06] son came into existence
[1:19:08] she world for hundreds of millions of
[1:19:11] years forming clinkers and burning and
[1:19:13] forming like it is today and still
[1:19:16] burning and still breaking Adams
[1:19:19] God's sling that stuff out there like a
[1:19:21] frisbee and just let it go and let it go
[1:19:25] and let it go and he says stop and it
[1:19:29] stopped and one day he sling this earth
[1:19:32] out there and he's slinging in when I'll
[1:19:34] tell you how they're out there and he
[1:19:36] says stop and the prophet of God says
[1:19:40] those stars are further from each other
[1:19:42] than they are from us to them
[1:19:44] oh my god he's great Church our God is
[1:19:49] marvelous he's great he's huge
[1:19:55] praise the Lord
[1:19:56] no wonder he could look at a tree cesare
[1:19:59] curse you and right then the life in the
[1:20:02] root died and Satan tries that same
[1:20:06] stuff and he can't do it
[1:20:09] Church if we realize who we are we can
[1:20:11] look at cancer right in the face and say
[1:20:13] I curse you because Satan still cursed
[1:20:17] and anything that he tries to curse us
[1:20:19] with we can curse it can you say man
[1:20:23] send it back to hell put it right back
[1:20:25] on the devil because we know who we are
[1:20:29] huh praise the Lord
[1:20:34] he said God in these last days is
[1:20:38] restoring back to the church again do
[1:20:41] you believe that isn't he wonderful to
[1:20:44] do it aren't we happy to be alive
[1:20:46] tonight to see it our eyes are beholding
[1:20:49] things that the prophets desired to see
[1:20:51] just before the second coming of the
[1:20:54] Lord
[1:20:55] we're seeing things tonight that the
[1:20:57] prophets desired to see but they didn't
[1:21:00] see it because they hadn't had this last
[1:21:02] prophet on the earth to be able to allow
[1:21:05] God allowed him to go back that far to
[1:21:08] see these things
[1:21:09] Daniel seen it but he's got to where the
[1:21:12] Lord says seal it up right
[1:21:16] someone seats just partial just portions
[1:21:20] of the word but in the last days in the
[1:21:24] last days God was going to take the lid
[1:21:27] off of it
[1:21:28] he's going to break the sales off the
[1:21:30] Word of God it's going to come down with
[1:21:33] an open book and reveal it all to us
[1:21:37] don't tell me the last thing better
[1:21:40] praise the Lord
[1:21:42] is that right so what are we doing we're
[1:21:46] possessing that truth in the beginning
[1:21:49] and bringing it up to our day and living
[1:21:52] on it they're right
[1:21:54] we're possessors here tonight Church
[1:21:56] possessors of the truth that right
[1:21:59] taking the truth he said the truth the
[1:22:02] word will defeat Satan anytime anyplace
[1:22:05] anywhere we got to come to that
[1:22:08] understanding of knowing the authority
[1:22:11] of the believers were possessors like
[1:22:15] Abraham can you say a man he was a
[1:22:17] possessor God told him something he
[1:22:20] possessed it that right I mean he knew
[1:22:23] who he was the prophet of God says when
[1:22:26] those kings come down and scold his
[1:22:28] nephew from that city down there law and
[1:22:32] all of them
[1:22:32] he said that was 2,000 of them men that
[1:22:36] took Kenan locked down there he said
[1:22:38] Abraham stood up and gathered his 12 men
[1:22:41] and said I'm going after my nephew and
[1:22:46] he went after his nephew down to those
[1:22:48] two thousand people slaughtered in Kings
[1:22:51] destroyed and took blood and everything
[1:22:54] that he had took from him and brought it
[1:22:57] back God likes to see victory and here
[1:23:01] comes God before Jesus Christ he steps
[1:23:04] down in a body of milk as a day and
[1:23:06] meets Abraham because he was a possessor
[1:23:09] God wants to see possessors in this
[1:23:12] stage that right he had a revelation
[1:23:17] Abraham did right this God has called me
[1:23:22] and separated me for my people to be a
[1:23:25] possessor
[1:23:27] we're possessors here tonight church we
[1:23:30] take back what the devil tries to steal
[1:23:32] from us can you say man he's a like a
[1:23:36] thief he's growing like a line trying to
[1:23:39] steal away this still away that and the
[1:23:42] most thing he's trying to stay away is
[1:23:43] the truth but we're taking back the
[1:23:48] truth they might praise the Lord
[1:23:52] hallelujah it's better and better and
[1:23:58] better
[1:23:59] they're right look at that lamp stand
[1:24:03] one time God allows Moses and men to see
[1:24:07] what was in the heavens and God says now
[1:24:11] what you've seen go down here on the
[1:24:13] earth and build it that tabernacle there
[1:24:16] I everything has got to be like it was
[1:24:19] there and then you know so he sees this
[1:24:23] lamp stand and he gotta build it up the
[1:24:26] way God told him to build a gyro and God
[1:24:29] says now I want you to take pure olive
[1:24:31] oil and put it in these lamps amen
[1:24:36] and I want you to burn and let it burn
[1:24:38] always huh he's got a burn always praise
[1:24:44] the Lord and he had a Moses to tell
[1:24:47] Aaron to put the fire on all right and
[1:24:51] so they lit it and it's burning and then
[1:24:55] one day Amen these sons of Aaron let's
[1:24:59] it go out right brothers and sisters I
[1:25:03] want to tell you God's get of us a

[1:26:55] in the beginning it was just the
[1:26:56] lampstand well if you turn over here in
[1:26:59] revelations chapter 1 John in the end of
[1:27:04] the book heard a voice talking behind
[1:27:07] him he was in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:27:09] Day and the prophet of God said John
[1:27:12] tights the bride whatever John sees we
[1:27:15] see whatever John hears we hear and John
[1:27:20] is going back to the beginning and he's
[1:27:21] going up to the future and he's going
[1:27:23] here and he's going there brother I tell
[1:27:25] you God's had this bride all over the
[1:27:27] Bible he's giving this word after word
[1:27:29] line upon line precept upon precept
[1:27:33] Enoch had to bottom all the way to the
[1:27:36] top he didn't build a half a word he not
[1:27:40] built the whole pyramid and God
[1:27:42] capped it off with coming and taking
[1:27:44] Enoch out of there
[1:27:45] we're not taking a half a word Church
[1:27:48] God has opened this word up in this end
[1:27:51] time and we got all the word we got all
[1:27:55] truth to build a perfect life upon that
[1:27:59] right Amen it's up to us to keep it
[1:28:03] burning and it says John Saturn and seen
[1:28:07] that voice and he's seen a lampstand and
[1:28:10] then the myths of the lampstand it gets
[1:28:14] better it's not just a candlestick it's
[1:28:17] not just light but in the midst of camp
[1:28:20] saying is the son of man it's God in
[1:28:23] this word God in his lamp stand God in
[1:28:26] his truth say it's better get some more
[1:28:31] revelation more truth right amen praise

[1:28:43] voice in the final age they're right
[1:28:47] more truths revealed to us he says we've
[1:28:51] got to go through and get that character
[1:28:54] they meant to be that final voice in the
[1:28:57] final age said I amen and that's why
[1:29:02] we're going through all these testings
[1:29:03] and troubles trials so it can be that
[1:29:07] spoken word hey man is that right I mean
[1:29:11] you can speak to the mountain and to be
[1:29:13] tossed into the sea that right it'll not
[1:29:16] to be a public show but it'll be an
[1:29:18] individual fire present look it'll be a
[1:29:21] little headache that you got it'll be
[1:29:23] your child that's sick it's going back
[1:29:26] and possessing a man what had them in
[1:29:29] the beginning having dominion having
[1:29:31] power the authority the spoken word is
[1:29:34] alright so we're going back and hearing
[1:29:36] this truth taking it up to our day
[1:29:38] bringing it home to our family brothers
[1:29:42] don't be afraid to speak the word amen
[1:29:46] is that right God wants to take this
[1:29:48] stimulation we go and get Revelator by
[1:29:51] and be
[1:29:52] able to speak to our problems at home
[1:29:54] speak to our car speak to the devil
[1:29:58] that's tried to interfere with our daily
[1:30:00] walk right
[1:30:02] hey man praise the Lord glory to God
[1:30:09] amen
[1:30:14] you know in the prophets life God give
[1:30:21] him some visions just like he did John
[1:30:24] give prophets visions alright it says in
[1:30:30] no words in that third pool you might
[1:30:35] not understand him your postures are
[1:30:37] good
[1:30:38] amen reveals some of that stuff to you
[1:30:41] but I don't think the bride's got it all
[1:30:43] figured out is that right
[1:30:46] but I believe it's gonna be revealed to
[1:30:47] us because we're just like Enoch taking
[1:30:50] one stone upon another stone and going
[1:30:53] up into higher places in Christ Jesus is
[1:30:56] that right and we see that the prophet
[1:30:58] of God he's brought before a cathedral
[1:31:00] and he's up above this Cathedral and
[1:31:03] he's looking down upon this and he sees
[1:31:06] some these people that are lined up and
[1:31:08] going through this Cathedral and when
[1:31:11] they go in he said that they're lame
[1:31:14] they're sick afflicted and then when
[1:31:16] they come through and they come to the
[1:31:18] end there's a reporter on the end that
[1:31:20] says what happened in there and they
[1:31:22] said I don't know what happened but all
[1:31:25] I know it was I was crippled and now
[1:31:27] look at me right amen
[1:31:32] but in the story there the prophet of
[1:31:35] God in the vision he says when I was up
[1:31:37] above this he said there was something
[1:31:39] that happened that I've never seen
[1:31:41] before
[1:31:41] he says the age of the Lord and we know
[1:31:44] the ancient Lord was with the prophet of
[1:31:45] God he said the pillar fire separated
[1:31:49] from the angel the Lord and he said he
[1:31:51] went down over to that Cathedral and
[1:31:53] began to hover over it and he said all
[1:31:56] of a sudden he went straight down into
[1:31:58] the room the prophets looking down upon
[1:32:01] this and the pillar fire is in the room
[1:32:06] hey man hallelujah look at Paul one day
[1:32:09] he's killing these Jesus people but he's
[1:32:12] serving God is that right
[1:32:14] amen he thinks he's doing God a service
[1:32:17] and he's killing these fanatic Jesus
[1:32:19] people one day is riding a horse and he
[1:32:22] comes along and all sudden the great
[1:32:23] light shines upon him knocks him off
[1:32:26] from the horse and he says Lord and GE
[1:32:29] God says I'm Jesus knocks him off with
[1:32:33] his heart church amen he thought he was
[1:32:35] doing something but he realized what his
[1:32:38] doing was totally wrong oh god Amy got
[1:32:42] ahold of the Prophet and restored and
[1:32:44] possessed the truth back to Paul right
[1:32:49] he took this experience on the backside
[1:32:52] of the desert and he took it back to the
[1:32:56] beginning just like we've been and found
[1:32:59] out this Jesus was a light in the
[1:33:01] beginning and now he could trace him all
[1:33:04] the way back down to the age
[1:33:06] oh brother we got a truth in this our
[1:33:08] day we can take the devil back to his
[1:33:10] beginning and take it to his in and say

[1:34:29] room

[1:38:19] there was a group of women studying the
[1:38:22] book of malachi and the Old Testament as
[1:38:25] they were studying chapter 3 they come
[1:38:28] across the verse which says he will sit
[1:38:30] as a refiner and purifier of silver the
[1:38:35] verse puzzled the women and they
[1:38:38] wondered what this statement meant about
[1:38:40] the character and the nature of God and
[1:38:43] so one of the women offered to find out
[1:38:45] about the process of refining silvering
[1:38:47] get back to the group this week this
[1:38:51] woman was called up to a silversmith and
[1:38:53] made an appointment to watch him at work
[1:38:55] she didn't mention anything about the
[1:38:58] reason for her interest beyond her
[1:38:59] curiosity about the process of refining
[1:39:01] silver she watched the silversmith he
[1:39:05] held a piece of silver over the fire and
[1:39:07] let it heat up he explained that the
[1:39:11] refining silver one needed to hold the
[1:39:14] silver in the middle of the fire where
[1:39:18] the flames were hottest as to burn away
[1:39:22] all the impurities and the woman thought
[1:39:26] about God holding us in such a hot spot
[1:39:30] then she thought again about the verse
[1:39:32] that he sits as a refiner and purifier
[1:39:34] of the silver she asked the silversmith
[1:39:36] if it was true that he had to sit there
[1:39:39] in the front of the fire the whole time
[1:39:41] the silver was being refined and the man
[1:39:44] answered yes and explained that he not
[1:39:47] only had to sit there holding the silver
[1:39:49] but he had to keep his eyes on the
[1:39:52] silver the entire time it was in the
[1:39:55] fire if the silver was left even a
[1:39:59] moment too long in the flames it would
[1:40:02] be damaged
[1:40:04] the woman was silent for a moment this
[1:40:07] yester silversmith how do you know when
[1:40:09] the silver is fully refined he smiled at
[1:40:12] her and answered oh that's easy
[1:40:14] when I see my image in it Lord are you
[1:40:20] in the fire you feel like you're right
[1:40:23] in the middle of it
[1:40:24] why sure we are we're right in the
[1:40:26] middle of the fire in Laodicea
[1:40:29] glory to God but I want to take God is
[1:40:33] in the middle of a fire with us he's
[1:40:36] watching every second and he cannot turn
[1:40:40] his head from us is that right because
[1:40:45] too long in the fire were to overdo it
[1:40:47] and we can't be in the fire
[1:40:50] not just long just - not long enough we
[1:40:53] got to be in the fire just long enough
[1:40:54] it meant that the Lord will say well
[1:40:57] done oh I tell you church amen we're not
[1:41:02] going to get there till it's well done I
[1:41:05] say Lord keep me in the fire till I can
[1:41:08] hear those words well done hallelujah
[1:41:12] praise the Lord he said when we get over
[1:41:15] there we'll walk in and we'll hear the
[1:41:16] sweetest words he ever said well done my
[1:41:19] good and faithful servant huh we won't
[1:41:23] be right and we won't be medium will be
[1:41:27] well done that right we're going to a
[1:41:34] marriage supper and that's why we're
[1:41:37] drinking is really good he saved the
[1:41:40] best for last
[1:41:41] I'm enthused about it how about you I'm
[1:41:45] excited about it let it remain in you
[1:41:49] we're not going back to the Garden of
[1:41:52] Eden we're going something better than
[1:41:56] that can I explain it to you in the best
[1:41:59] way that I can in the Garden of Eden
[1:42:04] there was Lucifer walking around seeking
[1:42:09] who he could deceive and he found a
[1:42:13] vessel that he could use to deceive
[1:42:17] their eye and then he found Adams little
[1:42:22] wife huh there was going to be a
[1:42:26] marriage in that garden Eden but he got
[1:42:29] to that little wife before Adam got to
[1:42:31] her that's terrible isn't it you know
[1:42:35] the devil's trying to do the same thing
[1:42:36] with us
[1:42:37] huh he's trying to get us before God
[1:42:40] gets us huh
[1:42:42] but anything gonna happen it's not gonna
[1:42:45] happen not this time
[1:42:47] is that right amen because it's
[1:42:50] predestinated for it not to happen is
[1:42:53] that right amen
[1:42:55] so in the garden Eden amen it was
[1:42:57] beautiful it was nice but the devil was
[1:43:00] walking around and he found somebody but
[1:43:04] what's better than that when we get into
[1:43:06] the Millennium the Bible says then the
[1:43:08] Satan will be bound a thousand years
[1:43:13] we'll have that garden eden back as
[1:43:16] perfection but the thing about it is
[1:43:19] it's going to be better because Satan is
[1:43:21] bound a thousand years now if you'll
[1:43:24] tell me how long the Millennium is going
[1:43:26] to be a man it's gonna be a thousand
[1:43:28] years so there's not one day that the
[1:43:30] devil ain't gonna be bound
[1:43:32] he's bound from the beginning of it to
[1:43:33] the end of it now that's better than the
[1:43:36] garden Eden
[1:43:37] he saved the best for last I don't have
[1:43:41] to worry about the devil walking around
[1:43:43] he's bound how's he been he has no one
[1:43:46] to work through
[1:43:48] he has no seed to come through he sealed
[1:43:53] the whole church
