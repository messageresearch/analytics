give their offering as sister anna sings i've asked her to sing this i heard it last night on the broadcast and it really touched me it's a blessing when i see the dark clouds partying when the rain is gone and sun is breaking through i anticipate when life will just be normal just to close my weary eyes and rest in you my heart can rest so easy when they're blue skies when the rain is gone and wind is not inside how i long to hang my sword above the mantle away from harm and distant from the fight but i wouldn't know your peace without the hard times or be thankful for relief without the pain i wouldn't love the light if it were not for darkness or appreciate the sun without the rain [Music] how could i understand forgiveness without failure [Music] or feel the warmth of love without the bitter goal how could i hold your healing hands without affliction and be blessed to see your mercies sure it's a blessing to be safe secure and warm but lord i want to thank you for the storm imagine as peter said in prison he may have paced the floor with chains around his feet in his mind the devil taunted and whispered the battle's lost and this is your defeat but then his mind went back to that night in the tempest when the master spoken winds and seas obeyed and he remembered that storm combing all around him so he could rest in that dark praise [Music] and say i wouldn't know your peace without the hard times or be thankful for relief without the pain i wouldn't love the light if it [Music] or appreciate the sun without the rain how could i understand forgiveness without failure or feel the warmth of love without the bitter cold how could i hold your healing hands without affliction and be blessed to see your mercies all unfold sure it's a blessing to be safe secure and warm lord i wanna thank you for the storm hallelujah praise the lord aren't you so grateful that you know the lord jesus in the midst of every storm he bring you through he knows how to calm the waves or he knows how to give you grace to crest the wave if that's what he wants you to do would you stand with us today as our pastor is coming to minister the word of the lord to us can i sing the course i know the master of the wind i know the maker of the rain thank you lord i know the master of the wind know the maker of the rain he can calm the storm make the sun to shine again [Music] i know the master of the wind i know the maker of the rain [Music] he can calm the storm make the sun to shine again [Music] sing again i know the master of the wind [Music] he can calm the storm make the sun to shine [Music] sometimes i soar like an eagle to the sky among the peaks my soul can be found but an unexpected storm may drive me from the high it may bring me low but never bring me down sing again i know the master [Music] aren't you glad you know the one that can speak to every storm i know the master [Music] he can come [Music] oh he can calm the storm and make the sun shine i know the master of the wind if you do give the lord jesus give yeshua a handclap of praise wonderful wonderful savior wonderful messiah thank you oh he's good you may be seated but don't quit giving him praise he is wonderful and worthy how many of you are glad to be in the house of the lord today we welcome every one of you here and so wonderful i know i already said it but i'm going to say it again kylie was raised in this church and uh he's come to see me a couple times through through the years in my office always unexpected but a real real pleasure and uh i'm just very thankful i know he has other obligations i know he's a married man now and i know a lot of things have come and gone in life but my my do i just sound like an old doting grandfather or something it happens when you pass 50 you just start seeing things differently i feel like the youngins have come home and i'm so thankful and they were here last weekend and they were invited to come and play some volleyball with the kids and i just enjoyed them being here so much and we didn't we didn't say anything to them about being in church but i'm so glad that they're here today and and mama pam too aunt pam we're glad too god is good to all of us we've counted the 50th day of the owner we've made it all the way through from from uh from passover and the feast of first fruits we've made it through those 50 days of counting the omer if you uh if you're even mindful of those things i try to be and uh so today uh as the sun went down last night we began the biblical feast sometimes erroneously called jewish feasts they don't belong to the jews only they belong to bible believers i'm a bible believer i believe it and so we began the feast of shavuot last evening and i'm happy to be here but there's one place i might would enjoy being and that would be at home in jerusalem i have spent some wonderful shavuot weekends uh thanking god for giving of the instruction and thanking i've been in the upper room the place that marks the upper room i've been in the upper room on the day of pentecost and you know that may not be the exact spot this one sits over the supposed tomb of king david may not be the exact spot but it's the right mountain it's on mount zion it's in the right city it's in jerusalem it's in the right land the land of the bible and oh what a feeling oh what a feeling to stand there there's only one event that i don't have to ever repeat i've been there for sukkot and i've been there for all the other feasts passover and and so many others even been there during hanukkah time but i was there one time for palm sunday i don't ever have to do that again i i don't have to be caught up in that again i've never seen such a crowd of religion in all my life and uh we got caught right up in the middle of this procession that takes place on the mount of olives by the by the catholics and the greek orthodox and and the coptics and all the other very very dry religions in the land i'm telling you that was not for me i i don't need to be there in that but anyway i i'm happy to be here today because the lord is here how do you know because i brought him with me when i came and i hope you did as well and the lord has just been so good to us i don't have the birthdays and anniversaries wrote down i was running a little behind it getting that done this morning but i noticed that paul and martha who are not here but they have a wedding anniversary maybe friday at least it's is that right well uh and we want to wish them a happy anniversary perhaps they're streaming today and then the only other birthday that i saw yesterday when i looked but i could have missed was ariely and i don't see her where is she is she out ariel her birthday is next saturday and does she turn the big 13 13 and so i i hope you all will tell her maybe she can hear it on the speaker i want to wish her a very happy birthday and uh if did i miss you wanna anybody wanna tell on somebody sister sharon yours is saturday too you know what i'm not sure it's on the calendar did you did you have someone to remove it or you don't mind you must not well let's get that out right [Laughter] [Applause] yes it's funny that you would say that because sometimes people say you know how old is sister sharon i'd say i don't know i don't know i think they see you moving around you know and enjoying yourself so much and they want to know so now you know the whole world knows i like it that's all right we want to welcome you who are streaming uh in belgium in arkansas i'm just looking here in ghana in seal alabama wherever that is amen sister terry and her mother are both streaming some brother john over near savannah and i don't know where some of these brethren are from but god sees you and we're so glad you're here tucson is represented trinidad the netherlands vancouver british columbia indiana israel how wonderful cape town south africa india god bless the bride gospel mission in india and let me check one more place we stream so many places how about how about pennsylvania how about washington state how about japan bless every one of you and there are others there are others and we can't always uh remember and take the time but we're just glad that there's a connection on the other end i don't ever get requests to sing i i i i'm not insulted but i don't but i did today [Music] i wrote this song a holy spirit wrote this song many moons ago i was standing on a mountain looking toward the sky [Music] when i saw a storm approaching and i feared that i would die i saw god's creatures run and seek a better place to hide [Music] but up above put the thunder roll down in my soul forgive me then i bow my head and cried now the clouds were moving faster and the lightning was flashing bright [Music] and the sun's so dark they hit the light of the sun and it seemed that it was not all but all at once there was a feeling like i'd never had before up above the storm you should have heard me sing god had given me eagles [Laughter] wings sing it with me now so spread your wings little eagle and fly you weren't born to live down in that old valley no you were born to soar through the sky don't let your trials bring you down or drive your spirit low to the ground just mount up with wings [Music] [Music] all at once his spirit me till i was high above it all you know i never even had to move my wings the holy spirit he had control i was soaring high above my circumstances all my confusion and my pain and though i had spent many years in that old barnyard i was always an eagle [Music] by his name spent some time with the chickens but i know who i am this morning spread your [Music] you were not born to peck around in that old valley no no no no no you were born to soar through the sky don't let your trials break you down or drive your spirit low to the ground just mount up with wings little just keep your eyes upon the sun the battle is nearly one mount up with wings little eagle and flies [Music] yes there we go sorry i turned it off you were not born to live down in a valley you were born to soar through the sky you know a group in gospel music wanted the song years ago it's been a long time now but they wanted me to change the line about being in the barnyard they didn't know the story but they didn't know where i had been i said no if you can't do it like the holy spirit wrote it then you can't have it but those of us who spent some time in the barnyard learning we're glad to be free we are glad to be free come on give god praise glad to be free no denominational barnyards for me thank you all thank god for every musician the leading benjamin that was excellent this next time i wish you'd put a little more in it you know you're just holding back he just holds back he's usually a sweaty mess when he's done yeah that's right acts chapter 1. first 11 verses we're teaching this morning preaching too and we need your help we want you to know if you're here and this is not your normal church or average church or place where you usually are we're not in a hurry and we understand you might be you may have other obligations we don't make any other obligations on sunday but you may and if you do and you need to slip out at any time you feel free and we won't talk bad about you we will understand but we won't rush for you i just need to let you know that too because we only have one service on sunday and we make it count amen so i that's not to be offensive it's just to let you know that we know that sometime you must slip out and please do we understand completely but we want to be here till we're done amen this is it means something to us and we could uh we don't have but two services a week and we're together a lot more than that but we want to make it count verse 1 acts chapter 1 the former treatise have i made all theophilus of all that jesus began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the people whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god perhaps you already know that 40 days after the resurrection of our lord he remained in the earth speaking the kingdom to those who were with him that the bible said here to them that he had chosen he wasn't looking for the big crowds in those 40 days he wasn't doing evangelistic work in those 40 days those 40 days were reserved for those that he had chosen to hear those things pertaining to the kingdom now god is still making choices like that today whether we want to realize it or not i know that the church likes to emphasize whosoever will and i believe that with all my heart but i also believe that there is a people being prepared of the lord around the world today to hear the special things of the kingdom i remember bobby connor being here some years ago and saying that that god shouts his truths but he whispers his secrets amen and you know if you're waiting for the shout you might you might get it you might get the loud but you may miss that that love secret that he wants to share with those that he's chosen to overcome in laodicea to the church write these things and to them who overcome right these things i want to be one of those that overcomes i want to overcome the spirit of the age that i'm living in and manifest christ to a world that needs him more than they realize to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem sounds like it was more than a suggestion but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel now even among the chosen there were those who were of a political mindset they were still seeing the messiah as a political answer to their problem to end the occupation of rome they were not seeing the full picture of why he had really come to the house of israel let's let's read on and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power i want to make sure you understand it was not for them to know it's not for them to know they weren't living in the last days you and i are living in the last days to us it has been granted the blessing of knowing times and seasons under the anointing of the sons of issachar we must know the times and seasons of the lord we must know the ebbs and flows of what he's doing in the earth and he said unto them not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power verse 8 but ye shall receive power you just be concerned about power you need it ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and in samaria and under the uttermost part of the earth this was a time when people were hiding their faith they were afraid of the romans and though their devotion was something they were they were putting in the closet and hiding under the table but now the holy ghost is coming jesus said and you're going to have power you're going to have courage you're going to have boldness to be witnesses of what i'm doing and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel why which also said ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven i love this this help me same jesus not another same one this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner with a cloud in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven now let's pray just a minute father we thank you that you are god's sovereign you are god's supreme and you are lord over every situation we're not gathered here today to be seen we are gathered here to learn of you we've enjoyed the atmosphere that has been created by the worship we thank you for coming we thank you for moving among us there were a few moments during that worship where we could feel things shifting above our heads lord we thank you for that we thank you that we don't have to settle for oppression we don't have to settle for depression we can have open heavens over our lives we're learning how to open them and to keep them open as we enter into the sincerest part of praise and worship now lord we approach the reason why we're here we're here to learn of your word we're here to be challenged and quickened and changed by the living truth that it contains there's one thing we recognize now lord after all these years satan is also among us he comes because he opposes the delivery of the word of god he doesn't oppose the quoting of the word but if the living word should come and stand among us today and teach us by the anointing of the holy ghost then that enemy would do everything within his power to hinder that moment but we just serve notice to all enemies that our god is powerful and that he has filled us with holy ghost and with fire and we are here to learn of him so lord we ask right now that you would cause us to have an unction of alertness and that we would everyone exercise the faith that has been given to us that we might be able to exercise the gift that you have placed in this house for this moment now lord you've used the other gifts i've seen you using the musicians and the worship leaders and those who run the equipment and all the different parts of this service and now lord i ask you to use the gift that you have placed for this part and we'll give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the mighty name of our messiah yeshua the lord jesus christ we pray and the church said amen amen you may be seated so the church world uh calls this pentecost sunday that's all right i'm for that penti is a greek word penti is a greek prefix for 50. we've been preaching on jubilee we've been talking about that total deliverance requires a complete separation from all unbelief are you with me and many are going back over that series because they have come to the understanding that they need total deliverance still some things hanging on in the realm of the soul in the mind and in the will and the emotions we're still dealing with some junk it's all right you don't have to be ashamed of that you were going to be ashamed you'd only be ashamed of the fact that you didn't care what was still hanging on to you but thank god you care and thank god you keep pulling yourself into his presence so that he can massage your heart with his fingers and accomplish what he wants to accomplish in your life i tell you it's a wonderful thing to be in the hands of a living god it's only fearful to those who won't allow him to purify them first but to those who understand that it is not my righteousness that i stand here with today i can do all the church entity right and still not be righteous oh i can dress right live right talk right walk right sing right spit white i'm old i've heard them say it all you know they used to say i'm my mom i'll do this right and still all my tables would be full of vomit when i compare what i would be able to accomplish without him with his righteousness but i stand here today dress in a righteousness that is not of my own i've done absolutely nothing to qualify for it except to say yes that is our responsibility in this hour to keep putting ourselves under the unction to keep drawing up under the spout where the goodness and the glories of god run out that's what we need to do and you don't have to be in church to do that you can worship god on the way you can worship god in your home and in your yard and your garden and wherever you are you need to create a sanctuary wherever you are because we're living in the last days and the wilds of the enemy are all around us and that old hypocrite lion is always roaring he's an imposter he's an imitation he desires to mimic and mock the lion of the tribe of judah he's not a lion but as a roaring lion he walks about seeking whom he can pluck out and pick off he's not only out in the world doing that are you with me he's right in here among the saints of god looking for those who remain weak for those who let a little heart of criticism get in them how many of you remember a warning that the holy spirit gave us not too many weeks ago he said guard your heart against any and all offense did you know a fence is taking people out of the fight the enemy he's just watching he's just watching people drop off in this hour because they get offended so easily great peace have they psalm 119 verse 165 great peace have they which love thy law thy instruction and nothing shall offend them and if you looked at that in hebrew it would say nothing shall be a stumbling block to them because they refuse to stumble how many of you know the commercial that goes around i've fallen and i can't get up that's not for the bride the bride falls she fails sister anna's sung about it we make mistakes but the bride just gets up and says lord have mercy on me i can't quit now i'm too close to being in his image i'm too close to being transformed in his character and in his likeness when i fall i must get up i have to i i wasn't created to you know tap around peck around here in the valley glory you know the the farmer found an egg he did he found an egg he didn't know where it belonged so all he knew to do with that egg was to take it to the barnyard and put it under a hen and mama did her part and she hatched them all hers and somebody else's amen and i was that i was that one the farmer found i hope you realize you were the one the farmer found you didn't belong under that hen you weren't going to hatch out a biddy i know some eagles that can short never mind i know some clucking eagles it's time for you to rise up and manifest who you really are amen oh i looked around and i thought mine looked a little different than the rest of these folks yeah how did i get here well i might as well make the best of it i guess i'm the ugly duckling anybody ever felt like that i guess i'm the ugly duckling in the church because what thrills them don't seem to thrill me and what thrills me doesn't seem to thrill them but but here's where mama put me so so i i guess i'll just have to be what i am and do the best i can in all those grubs those worms those denominational systems that they tried to feed me by oh it tasted so awful to me but i didn't want to starve to death so i ate what my brothers and sisters were eating seemed to sustain them and strengthen them so i got some nourishment from it because even in all that the spirit would fall come on and then one day i i i got to flapping my wings around and realized that i could get a little higher than the rest of my brothers and sisters and there they stood looking up at me show off show off trying to be spiritual emotionalism but i like the feeling when the wind would get under my wings and lift me up a little bit i like the feeling and one day i flapped them enough and found myself on the top of the fence post and i'm looking down in the barnyard and from there i really realized i didn't belong down there nothing wrong with those fine feathered friends but i just wasn't one of them no criticism for them they're doing exactly what they were born to do judas did exactly oh watch you get quiet now judas did exactly what he was born to do the bible said so i didn't make that up the bible said born the son of perdition an unbeliever from the beginning where in the close of a mate believer oh but i heard a prophet say when it come time to go up to the upper room oh judas could cast out devils and he could heal he could do a lot of things with the rest of them but when it come time to get up there to the upper room he couldn't get all the way to the holy ghost you see there's a mark in this thing there's a seal that comes when we can get to the upper room and receive the true baptism of the holy ghost and that's not a feeling that's not an emotion that's not a wiggle that ain't even talking in tongues that's the very same life that was in jesus christ poured out [Music] pour it out into my life into your life this same jesus here he is in here i didn't say me in here he's living in his in his sons in his daughters in his bride oh and it seemed like i could hear my mother clucking down there you know that's all the only mother i knew that's the best chicken i can do who can do a better one mama was just preaching away gathering all her little youngins all her little bitties under herself and i thought mama thank you you've been so good you hatched me you did a good job you fed me when i couldn't feed myself i'm so thankful but all of a sudden i heard a call from another dimension i heard an eagle scream nobody had to tell me no preacher no pastor no presbyter no overseer no district superintendent no pope no priest no reverend no pastor nobody had to tell me that i was connected to that something on the inside of the inside of the inside of me began to leave up and down just like jesus in mary's womb i began to leave my spirit man was quickened and i recognized my father on that day come on i realized i was living in a barnyard but i was destined for the skies well i had never flown before so i wasn't sure how it worked but that's okay he came for me as the story goes you've heard the story time and time again either the mother the father however you like to portray the story came right down right up along that fence post and i just hopped over on the back and he took me to the heights and i never wanted to go back to the confines of a barnyard again that's what the song meant long explanation i spent many years in that old barnyard but i was always an eagle and when i heard my papa scream when jehovah eagle screamed over my life i recognized that i was destined to be a little higher to live a little closer to the heavens than those that were destined to peck around on this earth so i'm encouraging you as the holy ghost came a few weeks ago guard your heart against any and all offense and purpose within yourself i'm going to be unoffendable how many of you are brave enough to say you're going to be tested before you go to bed tonight the enemy is going to test your testimony he's going to test your confession but you can't be afraid of the test you've got to stand on the word and the word said great peace have they which love the law of god and nothing not even when they call you holy roller holy roller nothing shall by any means offend them so the lord said stay close to one another don't let anything or anyone come between you and the rest of the body you pull into christ and as you pull into christ you pull into one another and and he just he just solidifies your place in his body oh yes and you keep away from the from the the spirit of speculation and uh and suspicion thank you stay away from that and you ask god for real holy ghost discernment anybody with me all right matthew 28 6 as quick as possible i'm not not uh getting very far in what i have planned for today matthew 28 6. he is not here for he has risen and he said come see the place where the lord lay that's the end of matthew luke 24 49 here is the end of of the book of luke and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high so matthew ends with the resurrection of christ luke ends with the promise of the holy ghost mark 16 19. it ends with christ's ascension so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god which is the right hand of power and authority are you with me and then john 21 22 ends the book of john so we've talked about the ending may not be the exact last verse but the theme of the ending of matthew and then luke and then mark and here is the ending of the gospel of john jesus saith unto him if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee follow thou me who that is the theme of christ's coming number one and that is the advice that i've given you to live an overcoming life keep your eyes on jesus and all for people number one number two keep your eyes on jesus and off of other people number three keep your eyes on jesus and off of other people don't worry about what john is doing don't worry about what your brother and sister's doing you just keep the old man the all your own self the one who lives between your own two elbows you just keep lining up with the word staying in step with the holy ghost you don't have time to examine your brother's walk preach to us pastor you don't have time to examine your sister's walk keep your eyes on the lord and watch your own feet you walk according to the word and everything will be all right and you'll become an example if you're doing what's right you've got clean hands and a pure heart and you're walking straight narrow without unbelief separating yourself on a daily basis from all forms of unbelief daily we're daily sanctified by the washing of the water of the world is that the word we're constantly being changed from glory to glory from faith to faith from strength to strength always a process always a work in progress isn't that the goodness of god so don't watch other people well i'm looking for somebody to fail you'll find them why don't you see if you can see somebody succeeding why don't you get in the wagon with somebody that's making this thing work hallelujah you know it's amazing to me how people in the mulley grubs attract more people than those who carry the victory i've watched these spirits cry out to one another isn't that what he said you just watch somebody get under some kind of something and the next thing you know they'll be joined with somebody under something similar the next thing you know they'll have a little click going or a little clan going or a little group going all under the same kind of holy spirit if you were to interview them i'm preaching now if you were to try to interview them and what they're doing they're trying to help that sister they're trying to help that brother but but the truth of the matter is spirits attract spirits why don't you find somebody in this house that has some victory in their life why don't you find somebody that shout hallelujah not just in church but out there who will live above unbelief out there find them they're here find them see if you can hang around them some of the time see if they'll let you into their inner circle of friends that's what folks need to do amen you mean forsake people when they're down oh no but what i find out is you'll be more successful in helping them if you get full of god full of the holy ghost full of the victory then you can reach down and yank them up to where you are you don't come down to where they are to lift them higher you stand where you are and lift them up and say come on up here to the winning side there's power in the baptism of the holy ghost anybody with me so then i read acts 1 and 11 and what acts 1 1-11 does is it ties together all four gospels and the theme that each of those gospels end with and it starts introducing what is to come the gospels have come to an end and the earthly ministry of our lord has come to an end in his own personal body do you understand that and now the ministry of jesus is about to multiply amen it's about to explode anybody here it's about to explode because instead of one jesus look out preacher that old devil standing over there in the graveyard he's jumping around and carrying on uh he thinks he's defeated the son of god he's knocked him out for the last count three days and three nights he's guarded the tomb jumping up and down having himself a party because he feels like he has defeated the gospel even the mother of jesus is weeping the disciples who loved him the most they're discouraged they're all hiding out in the house over there somewhere afraid of going to jail there's not much victory in the church at that time everybody's down in the mouth except the enemy he is dancing with glee i've stopped this thing come on i couldn't stop the seed couldn't stop him from coming couldn't stop him from living couldn't stop him from dying but i can hold him here because i alone have power over the grave and death is in my hand the old enemy thought and he is having himself a time but what he doesn't know is that before jesus left his earthly body left left his earthly ministry he said to them you better get up to jerusalem now because there's going to be an infusion of power that's going to come from on high and you're going to have to have that to stand so whatever you do don't miss your appointment with me in jerusalem get there and wait on the promise of the father am i am i still telling the truth good good good good just laying the foundation here and so they gathered they gathered in the upper room miracle of miracles of miracles all in one mind and one accord do you know how hard it would be to have a a christian gathering in this city or this community or this area and get everybody to be in one mind and one accord this bunch of intercessors we have today you know some are right in tune and some are way off tuned and they're calling down everything shooting errors at everything taking authority over everything you better listen praying over everything and can't agree on anything hello can't agree on anything but this was a time that 120 had gathered in the upper room and they were in one mine and one accord and their desire was to receive the promise of the father got to have him got to have him got to have him can't leave without him going to stay here till he comes somebody said well what about soldier ain't got time to think about that they get their mind right back on the lord come on come on come on my jewish messianic jewish friends say you don't understand what a miracle that is not only were you getting 120 to think on the same thing but you're getting 120 jews to agree that's what my friends say they say you can't get 10 jews to come into agreement about anything in doctrine and so to have 120 gathered there in the upper room in one mind and one accord waiting on the promise of to be endued with power from on high must have been a powerful thing in the enemy down there still rejoicing and carrying on the resurrection has taken place so that upset him he thought then i messed up here i couldn't keep him in the grave and then the next thing you know 40 days later he leaves and the enemy's glad again couldn't keep him from raising from the dead but run him out of town i saw him myself on the mount of olives when he ascended left the earth and here we are and i'm in charge again oh but he didn't know what was about to take place are you with me he didn't know what was going on in the upper room the same pillar of fire that had led the children of israel through the wilderness into the promised land was about to show up hallelujah on mount zion again this time that one pillar of fire would divide itself into 120 licks of fire all the same god all the same fire all the same holy ghost jesus said i will not leave you comfortless the extreme trinitarians like to say they love this verse they love to say i i will send you the comforter because they love to emphasize that there was a difference and of course there was we're talking about a spirit in a body and a spirit not in a in a body of course there was a difference but the bible's clear hear o israel the lord thy god is one i know the church likes to say three persons and we can't quite grasp that because we would think of three people and god is not three people he's three offices he's three manifestations or three demonstrations they're all the same spirit and if that is not the case then jesus had two fathers if the church could just get a little unconfused these days he didn't have two fathers somebody said well he had the heavenly father well then why didn't the bible say that the heavenly father overshadowed mary and she received them no no i didn't say that at all it said and the holy ghost overshadowed her and she conceived because the holy ghost was the same spirit not the same manifestation not the same office not the same demonstration but the same spirit as the father are you with me and so this is a very powerful thing that took place that day and i wished i could have seen the enemy don't you wish you could have seen the devil he's just skipping around i got rid of jesus i saw him when he left he won't be back because he knows that i'm in charge come on and all of a sudden down the road a bit in jerusalem they're praying they're in one mind they're in one accord and the promise of the father begins to be poured out on their head like a mighty rushing wind the holy ghost blew into that room hallelujah the holy ghost sat on their heads like cloven tongues of fire but he didn't stay on top of their head he filled out their heart he filled up who they were oh and the end of me i mean he's about to have a major breakdown standing outside the upper room now watching what's happening and he said oh what is this going on they're staggering around like drunk men speaking in some kind of foreign language i don't know what's going on but he was waiting on them to begin to come out and here come one and he said whoa he seems to be like jesus oh here come another one hey there's something for me he seems to be like jesus get it why did they sit because they had the same spirit that's why you and i need to be like jesus that's why we should be perceived as being like him because we claim to have the holy ghost which is jesus said not only did he say i'll send you another comforter but he said i will not leave you comfortless i i ah yes he said i'll pray the father and he'll send another comforter yes he said it but he said i will not leave you comfortless i i oh i feel good i'm not doing much preaching but i feel good anyway i i will come to you and that's exactly what happened on the day of pentecost jesus came to his church no wonder they call it the birth of the church no wonder they call it the beginning of the church because jesus came to his own house and he filled 120 with the same life that he carried on the earth while he walked among being hallelujah and no wonder the enemy said one two three jesus four jesuses five six seven eight nine fifty seventy five jesus what will i do a hundred oh 110. he's about to lose his mind as a 120 stumble out i got to help myself preach hey man brother nothing but the truth has 120 jesus to stumble out of the upper room filled with the same life that jesus had on here come on [Applause] are you preaching some kind of funny doctrine i am not same spirit now if you if you've got another spirit you can confess that and be delivered but if you've got him you've got the same spirit i'll come to you i'll come to you i'll come to you and he did whoa wonder what the enemy would think today when there's a bride all over the world in every nation of the world some of them connected to this service by streaming here there and everywhere in many many continents just just this little house reaching out to many continents today and the enemy can't do anything he tries he huffs and he puffs and he gets among us and he tries to distract us and he tries to discourage us he tries to depress us he tries to drive us to our own beds with grief he tries to affect our walk he tries to make us feel like everybody hates us and everybody's against us he tries to talk us into eating worms but you know what we do we just keep coming and we just keep praising and we just keep getting in that having come on church we just keep getting in that presence because we know that every change we need every deliverance that we need is found in that anointing it's found in that presence don't you settle for a dry dusty experience with god you get one that has life in it yes it'll change you it'll transform you anybody here all right so there's three uh initially there are three feasts that are what we call pilgrimage feast and in these three feasts all the male of israel were commanded not just invited but heavenly and heavily instructed you get up to jerusalem to celebrate and you need to be there all the males of israel get there and that's passover which celebrates the deliverance from egypt and the death of the passover lamb first fruits which is the beginning of the barley harvest and the wave remember the sheaf is waved over the harvest the first barley that comes to maturity is sheaved up it's bound up in a sheaf are you still here and way the priest went out into the field just like the jubilee priest did they went out into the field and they waved the mature grain oh can't you see church can't you see the hour that we're living in now can't you see what god wants to do in this day don't you know he wants to bring some sons to maturity don't you know he wants to bring us out of religion and into sonship and adoption don't you know that's what he's doing that's why he's letting you feel his presence he's not trying to take you back to something way back there somewhere he's trying to let you know you didn't need to lay that down you needed to bring the good holy ghost with you [Applause] you don't leave the holy ghost at pentecost you bring the holy ghost with you through through shovel all the way to sukkot you just bring him with you until he tabernacles there he's the same holy ghost he moves the same today as he always moved he testifies of himself the same way today that he always testified of himself i do not teach because i cannot find scripture that says that speaking in tongues is the initial evidence of the holy ghost i know that upsets my pentecostal brethren but i believe in speaking in tongues oh yes i do oh yes i do but i don't believe in hanging everything on one thing and then convincing people that because they talked in tongues a little or their tongue got a little clacky or confused i've seen it don't you tell me oh i've been in those meetings oh they don't do that today yes they do see my tie i've heard them all you have to do is believe for the holy ghost and then repeat after me see my tie tie my tie boy when i hear people talking in tongues like that i look when i hear them say see my time i i'm looking i want to make sure they got the real one they didn't get some kind of oh yeah i remember a preacher that come through when i was a boy and he said well just just just name the japanese brands honda kawasaki and you'll have it now that's why i don't teach it that way but i believe when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost and he begins to work in you he'll bring your life into alignment with the word and i believe that some time or another you will speak in tongues your life and your holy ghost will testify of itself by the way you live but i also believe brother daniel sent me a quote the other day where brother branham is getting excited and he's kind of praying in tongues and what was that the editor called it blank spot on tape one blank the holy ghost was witnessing yeah did it say that too unintelligible words afraid afraid to say praying in tongues afraid to say that don't want to upset the house let me tell you something when you get filled with the holy ghost he knows how to talk he's still a walking talking holy ghost so don't you ever go out of this place and say my preacher doesn't believe in speaking in tongues i do believe but i don't believe that you can measure somebody's holy ghost because they have the ability to talk in some language you see the hindu priests they do that down in haiti where they have all kinds of foreign religions i've been far enough close enough to some of them to see how they get caught up in some kind of ecstasy where they start talking in some kind of emphatic language too but that's not the genuine holy ghost let me tell you something if you want to if you want a real evidence of the holy ghost in your life you let the word of god cause you to lie let the holy ghost cause you to line up with that word and you start manifesting the character in the life of jesus christ you got the holy ghost [Music] anybody with me oh somebody didn't like that [Music] you just don't know what that does to me it makes me want to preach more so that was first fruits the celebration of the barley harvest they waved it over the harvest and said this is just the beginning of the mature grain and they waved it over the barley harvest and this was a testimony to all that as the first fruits have come to maturity so will the rest of the harvest in it wonderful when god gives us forerunners you hear me talking about brother random a lot and that offends some people get over it get over it if you're in the lutheran church to talk about luther if you're in the baptist independent baptist talk about rice so don't you get yourself all been out of shape because i mentioned brother branham i mentioned brother branham because i believe with everything that's within me that he was a son who reached maturity in his age i believe it and i believe god allowed that to happen as an example not so that you would turn in worship not so that you would come and say all kinds of crazy things like people say today that he was infallible you're kidding me but so that you would know what a mature son looks like and how one operates i believe there are others but i'm just using the one i often use the one that i know god has identified me with and i'm not ashamed and if that bothers you you can click off just like you clicked on because you're not going to change my mind i've been watching this too long i've been seeing these things come to pass just like they said just like he prophesied they would here we are now here we are russia raging again you know trying to stretch a little bit he told us all these things he also said don't fear communism fear romanism which is not just the natural restoration of the roman empire but the religious restoration of the roman empire under the catholic church you won't hear a lot of preaching about that and yet we found out there are more leaders who believe that then will preach it because they know how unpopular they would become if they were to identify who she is amen and the pentecostal church they were so afraid to declare such a thing as that that some of them begin to embrace the idea that islam is the antichrist system islam now here's a big problem with that the scripture told us that the false vine the false seed would manifest itself and it would look very much like the real is that true so when we examine the the the uh islamic system and the faith of the islam people islamic people would you say that looks so much like christianity that someone could miss not at all oh no that's not the way the deception comes anybody's still with me you were happy a minute ago did we get too tough for you does this not thrill you too it thrills me because i know one of these days there's going to be a pope sitting on his throne so when i see the one we have now stumbling around the way he's stumbling around i don't know if you've seen it lately he can hardly move when i see that i know you don't have to be prophetic to know he's on the way out and another one's coming will this be the one i don't know but one of these days he's coming and the scripture has told us just how that thing will operate so i'm glad to have my eyes open in this hour anybody with me so we're we're pilgrim we're making our pilgrimage to jerusalem for passover and first fruits and then the third is shavuot or pentecost and pentecost is the beginning of the wheat harvest and do you know how shavuot was celebrated in the bible the priest would bake two beautiful loaves full of leaven passover there was no leaven but in shovel these were big fat healthy looking loaves and the priest would pray over these loaves and he would wave them in the presence of the people to celebrate the beginning of the wheat harvest and to say to all of the wheat growing in the field here is the fruit of mature wheat and as this has matured so can you shovel oat celebrates the giving of the instruction on mount sinai the giving of the law and it celebrates the birth of the church which is the true pentecost that fell in acts chapter 2. the bible said and when the day this is acts chapter 2 verse 1 and when the day of pentecost was that's big big this is a greek expression here that says when it was filled completely everything that had to take place before the holy ghost could be poured out when everything was in place and the people come together in one mind and one accord when the day of pentecost was fully come or when the feast of shavuot was fully come see there was a huge crowd god knew exactly what he was doing by getting all the males to jerusalem for shavuot because they were going to get to see with their eyes and hear with their ears the outpouring of the holy ghost are you still there and and so they were all there with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them all of them and they were all filled do it again lord anybody need a refilling of the holy ghost do it again lord there's one baptism of the holy ghost but many refillings you can get refilled with the holy ghost every sunday if you want to and you don't have to wait to sunday [Applause] you can get it on tuesday night when we're gathered here in his name but you can get it on monday night at home in your living room or wednesday morning in your prayer time you can be refilled with the holy ghost as often as you present yourself under the spout and i encourage you to get as much of him as you possibly can and i encourage you to call the holy ghost him instead of it because he is not an inanimate object he is the person in life of jesus christ poured out inside of the believer and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues i'm not surprised as the spirit not see my tie ride my kawasaki not as someone got up and told them you know repeat your syllables i heard that too aeiou but as the holy ghost got in their tongue as the spirit of god got in their tongue and the spirit began to give them the utterance and they began to speak out what the spirit was getting giving them the utterance to say and it marveled the people that were there do you believe that they said what's going on here are all these men galileans then why is it that we who have come from the nations hear our language being spoken by poor galileans no education and yet they speak our tongue they were speaking tongues of men how many of you know tongues is not only a manifestation of the tongues of angels but it can also be a manifestation of learned tongues of men that you've not learned but the holy ghost falls how effective is that in the mission field it was pretty effective one night many years ago in the tucson tabernacle when the holy ghost fell on me in the aisle and i began to speak fluent spanish to a woman who was there with a real need in her life and when i preach this is the truth every time i preach at the tabernacle since then when brother aaron introduces me to come he tells that story because it was one that he was a personal witness to he knew that i couldn't even say taco right and yet they heard the holy ghost speaking in a language at that woman it happened and it happened in uh in uh i'll get there in a minute it happened in quebec nobody dislikes the attitude of the french in quebec like i did as a boy you couldn't even get an operator to speak english on the phone they were so upset with canada and so upset with america they wanted to be their own nation and the operators wouldn't even speak english to you and you didn't have cell phones you had calling cards anybody that old had calling cards and you can't use that calling card without somebody to help you and they would speak english to me and i was told that there have to be bilingual or they wouldn't be hired but they were so proud of that french language that they wouldn't even speak to me in english but the holy ghost fell in the prayer line one night and there was a woman and her son standing there in line and the holy ghost began to speak to her in fluent french and the whole church and even the skeptics that were there the whole church heard it and they knew that i couldn't even say voice correct or escargot so they knew that had to be the holy ghost so i can see where speaking these learned tongues of men that you've never learned i can see where that would be a very powerful thing but don't forget the bible also says that they were speaking tongues of angels which means heavenly languages of intercession and deliverance and power and revelation that you may not get the understanding of but it shifts the heavens because the other dimension recognizes the authority of heaven's language you you with me okay now we're going to move on if i were going to and i'm skipping you see all these pages skip skip skipping skipping if i were to give this a title i guess i would call this why i am pentecostal i preached a message similar many years ago that pentecost the title was pentecost is not a swear word because i have come into ranks in that hour where people were treating pentecost as though it was some kind of curse word huh and so i'm with some of these folks sometime when people ask them what they believe or where they go to church and they start stumbling around like baboons because they don't know who they are [Music] so sometimes they'll say we are non-denominational what does that mean i don't even know what that means non-denominational some people say fundamental that can mean a lot some people will say i'm evangelical i don't think you want to be in that boat because there's gay priest in the evangelical movement so i'm not sure you want to be in that anybody's still here and then some are bold enough to say well i believe the message of a prophet that's all right nothing wrong with that i do i follow a message of a prophet but it used to be easy we used to just be able to say well i go to a pentecostal church but see people have come to believe that pentecost is a denomination or that is an organization but the prophet of god for us was very clear he said it is not an organization it is not a denomination it is an experience so why don't we just say i am a pentecostal by experience not really a part of any pentecostal denomination but i believe in the power of pentecost i'm a word believer somebody said well then they're going to put you in the upc or they're going to put you there let them put us where they want to put us i'm not ashamed of pentecost i want somebody to go tell somebody to tell somebody i'm not ashamed of a pentecostal experience in a message called the supernatural are you still here we got to hurry we got to hurry let's see my watch is dead 116. we're doing good paragraph 20 but it's the attitude of the people that brings the results did you know you can come to church with the wrong attitude and leave with nothing but you can come with the right attitude in the right spirit and you have all you need it's always there it's always there no matter what's going on you may not even like what's going on but you come with the right spirit and the right attitude he said that's the reason at pentecost they had to go to an upper room and pray until the holy ghost came because they got in one place and one accord how many of you think we ought to do it every week we're coming together in one house and we're coming together with one purpose and that is to lift up jesus christ and receive from his word he said it's the atmosphere what brings the results anybody believe that i do i do he said let every man and woman in this building this morning boy or girl get everything from their minds but the lord jesus and believe that he's standing present right now and you'll see something happening that'll cause headlines in newspapers in the morning that's right he said it's atmosphere you just let somebody come in with a rotten way with a critical spirit with a spirit of offense you just let somebody come in with some kind of demon on their life and if we're not careful that thing will influence our worship that thing will get on us it'll bind us up we'll get all stiff we'll get to where we can't enter in so we have to make up our minds that that the body of christ sets the atmosphere for this house nothing is going to keep me nothing nothing nothing i'm going to come to get everything that i can get can everything i get receive everything that i need because i've come with that kind of a determination in my heart it's atmosphere he said i don't believe in joking from the pulpit because the pulpits no place to joke i know i've been guilty of that on occasion and by only excuses you just can't help it if you're funny sometime but i try not to tell jokes it's a sacred place he said i'm quoting something from us here mr bosworth how many of you know who brother bosworth was he wrote christ the healer very good sense of humor and he said brother branham to prove that its atmosphere said oh i like this one i've read it many times you could take a hint egg and put it under a puppy and tie him down and it would hatch a chicken it's not who the mother is it's the warmth that that body creates it's the warmth of the puppy's body that would hatch the egg anybody with me he said it don't have to be under the hen it can be under a puppy it could be an incubator it's the [Applause] and it's the atmosphere that brings the miraculous did you it's not the preacher that brings the miraculous it's not the singing that brings the miraculous it's the atmosphere and powers of god among the people it's the atmosphere of the people and when people get to a place they're reasoning and wondering and stewing and thinking and all tore up and don't know where they do stand half of them not even scripturally taught how can you expect the atmosphere to be right good question you can't do it it won't be right it's got to be in one accord in one place and settle down with one motive some people come and all they can think of is getting their songs sung or getting their little part of the service taken care of i want you to know there's a whole lot more to a service than just your part i don't have much confidence in a preacher that can't worship during worship but he wants everybody to scream when he's preaching [Music] i believe a preacher ought to lead the body i believe he ought to worship and show the people what worship is and what praise is we got to get in here together it's got to be in one accord one place settle down with one motive one thing then you're going to what see something happen now i want to go to possessing the enemy's gate stay with me just a moment we're nearly done not but we will be we'll make ourselves and i want you to hear what he said about the gentiles this is vitally important that the holy ghost fell on the gentiles this is our inheritance he said on the day of pentecost he sent down the holy ghost to continue are you here through the gentiles he'd been working through the jewish nation exclusively working through the jewish nation now on the day of pentecost he brings all these mixed groups they're all coming to the town and here this 120 they get the holy ghost they start wandering out in the street what is this are these men drunk it's just the um early hour of the day and and they're already drunk oh and peter he jumps up doesn't he say hi these men are not drunk as you suppose but this is that which was spoken of by the prophet joel that in the last days you know what you want to know when the last days began day of pentecost you know when the last days in when the bride goes out of here all of this church ages in between but thanks be to god he was using the gentiles to continue the work of the holy ghost he said on the day of pentecost he sent down the holy ghost to continue through the gentiles to take out a seed of promise are you listening he was taken out of people for his namesake from among the nations who you don't have to convert to judaism to be his he's taking out a people for his name oh hallelujah to give the gentiles the off-cast to give the off-cast that's who the gentiles are you know the to give them the baptism of the holy ghost to bring them into the promise if it had not been for the pouring out of the holy ghost you and i would have had no right to claim the promise but because the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost he said now we have a right to conquer all sickness yes we don't have to conquer it it's already conquered we just have to claim the promise anybody here and go take it it's already conquered death is conquered hell is conquered sickness is conquered temptation is conquered i'm with him all devils is conquered hell is conquered death is conquered the grave is conquered we stand in the gate whoa the bride is standing in the gate taking it listen listen you don't have to fire a shot it's already been paid for [Applause] [Music] [Applause] here's the reason why i'm not ashamed to say that i'm a pentecostal by experience because here it tells us in the token 1964 the pentecostal they claim we're a pentecostal organization there is no such thing hey the prophet said it don't exist this is not the only place he says it they're illegally using the name and the devil has intimidated message believers from identifying themselves with the pentecostal experience because they've moved are so far above it i'm telling you they can't live the victory that the pentecostals are living anybody here are you still here they're not living any higher than they were that's all right i like it i need it sometime if you're looking at me to see how i respond go ahead i got time sometimes we need to get a little excited about something i don't want to take you back to some kind of pentecostal movement or some kind of pentecostal organization but there's no such thing pentecost is an experience it's not an organization i'll tell you without that experience you're in trouble he said they tried to organize it but you can't you see what happened when they started organizing around pentecost the holy ghost just stepped away he just leaves them and guess what they do they just keep right on talking in tongues it doesn't organize pentecost is and read it it's the seal of god pentecost is what it's a what you're gonna you're gonna have the seal of god and not have a pentecostal experience don't think so i'm sealed what do you seal by right now it's the seal of god the holy spirit that come on the day of pentecost anybody here and excuse me i'm not preaching to you here today i have to on occasion preach the vote put that back sweetheart uh josh's sweetheart not mine but we are in the south you don't josh everybody sugar my wife i've had to get over everybody calling me darling and honey and sweetheart when she moved from canada here and every waitress will call you that and now sometimes they'll sit down the table with you and we look at them like we're like we're aristocrats or something the slaves are sitting down with us take that out strike that from the tape at least you're laughing for you extremists out there who believe that everything before 63 has been corrected i want you to notice this was february the 8th of what year 1964 seals have been preached and here the prophet is saying it doesn't organize pentecost is an experience it's the seal of god the holy spirit that came on the day of pentecost i'm i'm with him i believe that anybody here he said there let's go on here he said there's no such thing that's it that's that quote let's go to the next one spoken word is the original seed just just to put in one more sentence here i think it'll help you spoken word is original seed the latter part of paragraph 35. you cannot organize pentecost can't do it you organize it the blessing leaves he said because it's an experience and now let me tell you what he's saying and what it's god [Music] excuse me this is 62. but something tells me is still very much real just quote before he calls it the seal of god and now he calls pentecost god and you're ashamed to be identified as a pentecostal and having a pentecostal experience when the prophet of god tells us that it's god the experience of pentecost it's not a church not an organization not a denomination but it's a manifestation of god this is that the same spirit that raised jesus from the dead is here to quicken our mortal bodies and then he goes on and says what and god cannot be can't be so you organize god moves and what are you left with an organized church they've got a lot more order than we do i understand they got their coffee shops and their favorite tattoo artist amen aim not all that stuff but the but the the word is clear here without without pentecost as an experience we're just a lodge anybody with me can i do one more two more three more good let me do this and real quick we're ending this is from the as the eagle stirs their nest since we had something to say about eagles paragraph 82 you'll recognize this you remember the first time god ever spoke to you how many of you remember first time god ever spoke to you oh glory gonna call me a holy roller anyhow so you just might as well get started now oh my when i first heard his voice it spake like many waters oh my by the brook and stream were a rippling stream so he can lay down bathe and look up my he looked up and said what was that she'd come back over she said honey you're mine you don't belong in that place anyhow come out from among them and be ye separated saith the lord touch not their unclean things and i'll be a god to you i'll be a god to you you'll be sons and daughters to me see you don't belong to her that old organization that says the days of miracles has passed your mind somebody read that next thing to me your ego [Music] see oh that sounds good he said i understand that kind of talk yes sir why he was an eagle to begin with he actually he was actually an eagle he just got what he got the wrong nest that was all i hope i don't hurt you brethren but i'm just telling you the truth that's right many of them today [Music] i got jesus's picture here and brother branham's picture over here but have run any kind of pentecostal experience out the door hey somebody's in the wrong nest i said it somebody's in the wrong nest in the wrong nest huh mama is that what happened yeah you're my mama yes i'm your i'm your both father and mother sister brother i'm all in all to you that sounds good mama now mama what must i do this is the eagle talking back said i'll tell you honey [Laughter] i'm i'm winding down kylie did you tell your wife we go to church till two o'clock you should have told her said i'll tell you honey the way you got to do you just got to jump hey you got to just jump and get your feet off the ground there it is and then just go to flapping them little wings of yours just gonna flapping them as hard as you can you can rise cause you're an eagle see you got long feathers you got five primary feathers on the tips of both wings come on five and you can you can rotate those feathers you may not know it you may not stretch your wings in a long time but you have the ability god-given created ability to rotate those five primary feathers on the tips of your wings and it creates a centrifugal force that every mother eagle operates in because sometimes when she's kicked the little eagles out of the nest and they're learning to fly they get to eat and feeling their wheaties a whole lot sooner than they should and they wind up getting too far away from mother so mother is up here and little eaglets are flying down here and she looks down at them and sees them them little stinkers you teach them to fly and look they think they're grown so you know what she does god created her with this ability she rotates those five primary feathers like that and because she is so aerodynamically designed no bird is created or designed like the eagle she was so aerodynamically designed under her breast and her chest and out through her tail feathers that when she rotates them feathers like that that centrifugal force is created that catches those little baby eaglets that have gotten too far away from mother the word is nausea it's a prophetic word in greek i mean hebrew excuse me it's a prophetic word and it means to draw them up unto the breast which was a prophecy that god gave us here one time set the nations on your lap and draw them to the breast i've i've given you the milk to feed them with i've given you the food to feed them and other it goes on mama just shh rotates and those little baby iglets are sucked right up under mama's belly and she's scolding them good and proper i told you not to get that far away next time you better listen to mama now flapping them little wings of yours just flap them as hard as you can you can rise cause you're illegal see you got long feathers fly just jump off the ground start flapping your wings real hard i'll get you anybody here dead dry cold formal religion is that what you want said i'll tell you honey the way you got to do you just got to jump you got to jump and get your feet off the ground and then just go to the flap and then it'll wind yours it's real simple it's real simple isn't there more and he jumped up this little eagle coming out of them denominations you know the easter egg folks santa claus folks and give a great big flap four or five times and lit right on the barnyard post right in the middle of a pentecostal denomination but lifted right up above them and what you better not do is you better not hand out some of them books and tapes because they'll knock you right off of that post once they find out what you're doing you can't organize pentecost you can't denominate pentecost is an experience not an organization it's for you methodists you baptist you presbyterians how many glad to hear that god just calling anybody those that are his he's finding them wherever they are in their lodges and in their barnyards they try to draw fences around it but it's not so you read it for me would you eagles don't you go over there don't you go to alabama meeting don't you go don't you get mixed up with them folks don't you go all the way from arkansas to alabama on your only weekend off don't you do such a things as that why because everybody wants to keep everybody in the fence but not an eagle they'll just draw i'm gonna tell you they'll just get up high above the fence post and just go right over it sure they do don't pay no attention to it don't pay no attention to it eagles will fly right over how man tries to box you in don't you let man box you in in this hour don't you let your own ideas box you in you let the holy ghost lift you up above it now here's what we've got to remember and i may stop with this one why little bethlehem paragraph 92. here we go i know it's late how many of us in in it this morning how many is willing to forget your traditions how many is willing to forget your creed that disagrees with the word why ain't we got a revival why haven't we got these things going on good question what's the matter with pentecost it's organized itself that's it you can't organize pentecost you can make an organization but the pentecost is a blessing it's the power of god and if it's a genuine pentecost here's what you've got to remember it'll never bypass the word for a creed the holy ghost will never bypass the word to accept a creed it'll take the word right because it's circumcised from the world and the things of the world it sits only on the word of god and believes it we're in bethlehem candidates for the kingdom of god we're eating god's eternal life bread one more god give this one because this was where we kind of got our title this is uh the marriage of the lamb you'll be here tuesday night or stream in and we'll do the rest of these but paragraph 141 said now i think our organization does a good work that's all right see brother brandon was often asked to speak for the full gospel business men's fellowship and he often said that was the only organization that he carried a card with right i think our organization does a good work that's all right but you can't depend on that say i'm pentecostal because i belong to a pentecostal organization you're pentecostal you're pentecostal somebody said are you a pen you're out in the mall and someone says are you a pinnacle oh no i'm not a pentecostal said you're pentecostal when you get a pentecostal experience how many has a pentecostal experience and you're pentecostal i don't care if you belong to a catholic church you're a pentecostal if you've had a pentecostal experience you can't organize pentecost pentecost is an experience not an organization and that's right he said but we pentecostal people has begun to think because we have the name of pentecost we can go ahead and live in the world and do anything we want to he said we're like climbing nimrod's tower it'll go to ashes like adam's fig leaf apron she'll go back like the siegfried line in france the manual line in germany she crushed cause there's no other tower no other stand but the name of the lord is a mighty tower that the righteous run into it and are saying when you run into it you take the name the name not just calling a name but the name and the person that you are christ-like in the life amen wonderful he is yes church has done the same committing spiritual fornication as a woman that would share her love from her husband to another man oh this is getting serious that woman is not fit to be lived with you know that and when the church begins to share her fellowship with the world god is a jealous god he put israel away because of that now listen to this and his son will put the same thing away 145 he's going to have a bride that hasn't got a wrinkle in her amen she's holy w-h-o-l-l-y holy washed by the blood of his own self that's right so we see where we stand the wedding getting ready to come are you still here now we find out she commits spiritual fornications going out with the world professing something living something different that won't never work let me say again to everyone under the sound of my voice that won't never work what's the church ought to do what the church ought to do is do like esther did esther refused the adorning of the world that's very interesting that we would read this because shavuot the book of esther is a very important reading for shavuot time he said we know that little book of esther how that mordecai his uncle had a daughter and was down during the times of the reigns of the medes and the persians it's a very beautiful type there the king one of the greatest kings in the world that day he had a great feast and he called the queen to come and set by him but she wouldn't do it she refused to do it so what did he do he was so humiliated he didn't know what to do that his own wife wouldn't come i think that's a whole lot like christ today christ has invited us to eat in heavenly places with him and we're ashamed of it are you still with me good we're nearly done musicians would you like to come this way many people are ashamed to say that they got the baptism of the holy ghost who would ever thought we'd come to an hour where people would be ashamed to say they got the baptism of the holy ghost when i first received the baptism of the holy ghost at the age of seven i wanted to visit my granny one day and my granny was working in in her office doing income tax i'd had the holy ghost about a year and i wanted to come visit my granny and she wanted me to come because she would be free in the afternoon and she said to my mother would you care very much if i sent a taxi to pick up you could have probably done that without any worries in that day i don't know if i'd do that now or not but would you mind if i sent a taxi to pick up steve it was summertime and mother was working and she said no i wouldn't and i got a little nervous getting in this taxicab not quite eight years old yet uh or right at eight about to turn eight probably i got a little nervous about getting in that taxi cab with an old taxi cab driver a man i'd never met before and just all of a sudden it just dawned on me here i'm going off with a stranger and i watched the ways that he was turning to make sure he was heading toward big mama's house and looked like he was and i thought i got to get over my nervousness so he's i'm seven now i got to get over my nerve who is seven in here who who these kids are seven anybody we don't have any seven-year-olds got any six-year-olds how old are they six going on seven just pretend to be seven today so you just imagine putting millionaire in a taxi cab and sitting there somewhere i got a little nervous and i thought i got to get out of this nervousness so i said to the man guess what the lord did for me he said what'd he do i said he filled me with the holy ghost and fire and let me speak in tongues that man said well young man that's the best news i've heard in a long time then i said to him and you know what what he'll fill you with the holy ghost if you'll repent and be baptized he said i don't know son i've been a pretty wicked man i've done a lot of rotten things in my lifetime he said i've been overseas and i've i've fought in the war and i've killed men enemies of this nation and i don't know if god will forgive me i said sir god will forgive anybody that comes humbly and ask him to save him to forgive him of their sin i don't care what sins you've committed my lord will forgive you of your sins and save your soul and wash you with his blood and if you'll tarry long enough he'll fill you with the holy ghost and let you speak and done he said all i know is i want you to pray for me he said all i know is that so we get to the house and and uh my mama had left the money for me to pay the taxi cab and so the taxi man he gets out and opens the door for me i'm starting to get out he opens the door and he said uh young man do you mind if i come into big mama's house with you i said no sir don't you have to get back to work he said i can wait a minute or two and up the steps he come and he come in he said to my my granny said lady i just had to come and tell you this this this kid's a preacher he preached me under old time conviction he led me in a sinner's prayer and he's praying for me to receive the baptism of the holy ghost and my granny said well he's had good training and she said while you're here why don't we just pray again and she reached and put us [Music] i did i was not ashamed i didn't know that man i didn't know what he believed i didn't know what he thought about pentecost but i was not responsible for any of that i was not ashamed that he had filled me with the baptism of the holy ghost brother man said many people are ashamed to say they got the baptism of the holy ghost pentecostal people that's right they're ashamed to say it all right message believers what does he say next we're ashamed of him if you're ashamed of pentecost by experience you're ashamed of him is there more and so the queen wouldn't come she refused to come it humiliated him his face turned red everybody noticed he said i wonder if jesus face don't turn a little red too when he calls on us for a work calls on the pentecostal movement for fellowship and brotherhood and we're so tightly organized into little groups till we won't bend for the other he said we're so getting so worldly and things like that we're getting ashamed of the name of pentecost see i wanted to just bring a little balance here and say why i'm not ashamed to be identified as a pentecostal some people are afraid to say well i belong i'm a christian but he said i'm glad i got a pentecostal experience amen i'm glad to bear the name of jesus christ it's the greatest privilege i ever had to say i'm a part of him stand with me would you one more it's short it's from the church ages but you'll find brother branham saying this in other places but if the vine if the vine ever brings forth another branch of

ever felt it in the middle of a storm and he just come that wonderful marvelous peace now what god is doing for our brother elias we're giving god thanks for it he knew what he needed when he came he came determined today to meet the lord here to ask him for deliverance when i was praying over him i saw that it was generational and some of what he's dealing with has come down through generations but we're so thankful that once somebody catches a revelation that it don't have to be this way they raise up like he said like yesterday he sent a text and i'm determined i can't move out of my place until i get what i need from the lord and god's starting that he's starting that it's genuine it's real i sense the realness of it and once once somebody starts taking a hold of that it can stop when god blesses him with children and it doesn't have to keep moving down from generation to generation i'll tell you something else he can send it back up the line by the holy ghost he's got parents that need the lord he's got siblings that need the lord he's got family that needs more of god this is powerful when we get a hold of deliverance [Music] turn this mic up just a little bit i can't hear it i know they can we're closing but brother billy wanted us to pray over his daughter zion and her fiance solomon and they did such a wonderful job singing today i'm thankful for that it blessed us released a nice atmosphere in here we are not happy about zion moving away i'm not going to pretend like some people try to do i'm not going to pretend i don't like it i'm not sure it's god but it's not up to me it's up to him and so we're not going to withhold a blessing over this young couple we're going to send them out of here with our the best blessing we got to go and do whatever god would have them to do and uh but we're gonna whisper when they leave you've got a place if you ever need it i asked solomon we had a good talk this week and i said is there any chance that i might talk you out of taking her from it what'd you say solomon i i can't remember i had it in my mind and it slipped me probably not he said probably not well i liked that it didn't offend me i knew the answer before i asked the question but we love we love them both we love them both and we are thankful that they have found each other and i i won't know it'll never be easy there's always going to be that getting to know one another period and moving a new place and new schooling and new career and knew this and knew that but i tell you you can do it it's like i told them this week you can do it with him there's nothing that you all can't see accomplish with him so as our final spiritual demonstration here today we're going to ask them to come and we're going to pray over both of them with our love and blessing and we're going to look forward to getting to celebrate their wedding in uh how many weeks now say five five weeks is it that soon july 15th is that right 16th i'm going to be here on the 15th and the 16. july 16th they've got he's got family coming his grandparents who haven't been here in many years many years since the early 90s they're going to be here for that wedding i don't blame them for that and we're believing that god's going to give them a beautiful time together so would you all come and let us pray over you as a congregation peace peace [Music] wonderful peace will somebody play the piano for sister laurel coming down from the father above sweep over sweep over my spirit forever i pray in fathom bless [Music] belows of love and while you're praying for them pray for solomon and his position in the church uh where's the town i know it's washington say it again ferndale washington where brother john andes is the pastor and solomon's do are you doing all the worship leading it's on you you're on your shoulders so we want to pray that god will anoint him and use him and take that congregation into a higher place of worship it can happen you just get a worship leader under the anointing either the preacher will preach better and the offering will be better and everything will be better that's a heavy position to carry so we want to ask the lord to do that for him as well father in the name of the lord jesus christ this is our precious sister lord that we have watched grow up from a tiny little baby and lord we have watched her life and we've watched her victories and we've watched the enemy's attacks but we are thankful today that you have kept her by your grace and by your spirit and lord we indeed believe that you have brought them to this place today with one another lord and they are committing everything they have and everything that they are to your servant lord i thank you for that and and though we didn't know solomon his family not a stranger to us for we worshiped wonderful times together with his grandparents and days gone by and so lord we already have a connection in the spirit you've allowed them to find one another and there was no talking her out of him or no talking him out of her that's a good sign they have endured these last years waiting just waiting to get a little old enough get a little older and get the uh backing of both sets of parents and the blessing of her father and now lord all of that is in place and the arrangements are being made every day for a wonderful celebration of their union and i know their thoughts are on those wonderful things but today lord my thoughts are on their gifts and their callings and what you have placed in them for the body of christ and now lord our brother is he leads worship and steps up into that position oh god let us let his voice be anointed with the sound of heaven and let his thoughts be directed by the holy spirit and oh god give him the right songs let him catch the inspiration the same inspiration that falls on the preacher lord let him catch that even before the word goes forth to help prepare the hearts of the people lord use him for your glory i pray o god that anything that would remain in them resisting your voice or your direction or any deliverance that would be needed in their life lord granted come by the power of the holy ghost and fill them so full of your life that wherever they go and whatever they do they just impart the life of jesus christ so we call the enemy's plans defeated in the name of jesus and we bless them in the name of the lord jesus christ to follow the leadership of the lord as they come together to be one in you lord may they remember every day that they cannot make it without you they but with you all things are possible and available to them lord may that little place be blessed because of their union together in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen god bless you [Music] god bless you let's greet them love them from the father above sweep over sweep over my spirit forever i pray invite them lesbilos god bless [Music] [Music] of love [Music] stacy i want you to come here just a minute i know it's late but my watch is dead so time shall be no more once you all have greeted them slip back to your seats would you do that come here honey [Music] to you sisters

behavior haven't i it'll be 25 years that god's given us together and i want you all to know she has been the best wife best one i've ever had and the best one i could have ever had i've never seen another wife i wanted to trade her for i mean that and she's been the best mother to our kids and i'm so thankful for that and and everyone else's kids i saw that hug you was getting back back there with all them youngins at one time and uh yesterday was her birthday and she's a little north of 5-0 just so you'll know just a little you can ask brother greeley like i said he'll tell you but in a little while we're going to come back and bring our food and we're going to have a picnic today and we're doing it in honor of her birthday and it looks to me like somebody has tried to make it special for you and i'm so thankful for that but i just wanted you all to see her and i just wanted you all to know that i'm thankful for her and i'm glad for the day she was born she didn't know it she just knew two things she didn't want to be a teacher or a preacher's wife and she ended up being a preacher's wife and teacher for our children we uh got a robot for the pool because she worked so hard vacuuming the pool and uh we got this thing to do it for her and and the ladies laughed at us in there when we were talking to one another they heard us and they were laughing and and i just had to tell them you don't understand she does so much more than that for all of us and never complains i want you to just give her a little appreciation and let let her know with a little clap that you love her not like i do but i know you'll love her [Applause] [Music] lord bless her today meet every need in her life touch her body lord she deals with a little something that she has been to the doctor for a time or two and it keeps coming back but i know that the lord is able the last little uh test she had was a little little worrisome and uh but we are just believing that there's just nothing to it but would you ask the lord to dissolve it and let it pass from her body lord right now while the faith is here and and while these wonderful people have shown this love and affection for my wife what a great time for us to bring our faith together right now and ask you to drive out from her body anything that the enemy would try to place there to worry her or to hinder her or affect her in any way and we command it in the authority of jesus christ dissolve and pass from her body you are a trespasser you have no right and no authority in her body lord go with us today as we uh go and prepare our lunch and have fellowship together and as those who have to travel later today go with us all and may we cry out for more of the holy ghost this week may we not be ashamed of our pentecostal experience we don't want any identification with the organizations of this world but we don't mind and we are not ashamed to tell that we have had an experience a true baptism of the holy ghost and fire go with us today in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and the saint said amen you're dismissed to go in the name of the lord let me tell you this as you go on wednesday of
