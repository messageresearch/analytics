[0:00] The soul is the mind and the will and
[0:03] the emotion. In a healthy believer, the
[0:07] regenerated spirit is feeding life to
[0:10] the soul and to the body. But in a a
[0:15] human where things are out of order and
[0:18] where the soul is getting more food than
[0:21] the spirit man, the the regenerated
[0:24] spirit man feeds only on the word.
[0:28] And so if you are uh feeding on other
[0:31] things, of course we need moderation in
[0:36] everything because whatever you receive
[0:39] through these gates of our body, we it
[0:42] goes right into the soul which is the
[0:44] mind and the will and the emotion. And
[0:48] depending on whether you are stronger in
[0:51] your spirit or your soul, uh it's soul
[0:54] in the middle, mind, will and emotions.
[0:57] Everything that we see and hear and
[1:00] taste and feel, it goes into the flesh
[1:03] and from there filters into the soul. If
[1:07] the soul is being fed more than the
[1:10] spirit is being fed, the soul
[1:13] rules. And we live based on our own
[1:16] mind, our own will, our own emotions,
[1:19] while our spirit man shrinks.
[1:22] But if you're feasting, if you're
[1:24] feeding the inner spirit on the word of
[1:27] God, it's getting stronger and stronger.
[1:31] We often use the analogy of a
[1:33] stickman, which is about the only man I
[1:36] can draw, and a sumo wrestler. Who knows
[1:39] what a sumo wrestler looks like? You see
[1:42] this huge man, bun on his head, like a
[1:46] bone in his hair, big
[1:49] belly. And don't let that big belly fool
[1:52] you because he can he can throw down an
[1:55] opponent, can't he? Uh that little old
[1:58] stick man, he's not even good enough,
[2:00] strong enough to hold up his own hat.
[2:03] He's just one line and two little sticks
[2:06] and for for arms and two little sticks
[2:08] for a leg. I want you to know that some
[2:10] of us are walking around with a soul
[2:13] that looks like a sumo wrestler and a
[2:16] spirit man that looks like a stick man.
[2:19] I'm going to wait on you to say amen.
[2:21] Because we're feeding this sumo wrestler
[2:24] with all the stuff out there. All the
[2:28] stuff. Our mind is overstimulated by
[2:31] stuff. Our will is getting more stubborn
[2:34] because of stuff that we take in. And
[2:38] our emotions are getting more unnatural
[2:41] and
[2:43] uncontrollable because the soul is
[2:45] getting fat.
[2:47] If we can turn that thing around and
[2:50] begin to feed the spirit man, worship
[2:53] music, the word of God, the messages of
[2:56] the prophet, uh going back over a
[2:59] service at church, reading your Bible,
[3:03] hearing the devotion, doing whatever it
[3:06] is to feed the spirit man, then the
[3:09] stick man that's in our spirit, he
[3:12] begins to grow up and he begins to get
[3:14] stronger. And what happens
[3:17] [Music]
[3:19] automatically is the soul gets smaller.
[3:24] Mind, will and emotions get lessened and
[3:27] we start living out of the spirit. I
[3:31] know that I may be taking a long time
[3:33] with this, but I think you should hear
[3:35] it
[3:37] because I don't want to offend you, but
[3:39] I want to tell you that that some of you
[3:41] are are uh quite
[3:43] fat in your emotions.
[3:46] Your mind, your will, your emotions are
[3:49] getting the most
[3:51] nourishment. And the spirit man is
[3:53] shrinking and then you you want prayer
[3:57] because you're struggling. We all
[3:59] struggle,
[4:01] but sometimes our struggle is simply
[4:04] because we're feeding the wrong part of
[4:06] who we are.
[4:09] It's possible to feed the flesh to make
[4:12] that the stronger part of who you are,
[4:14] pampering ourselves.
[4:16] It's all right to take care of
[4:18] ourselves. Uh you should, especially in
[4:21] the areas of deodorant and shampoo and
[4:24] soap, and these are good things to have.
[4:27] hamper your flesh. Please, by all
[4:30] means, I I give you permission. Hamper
[4:34] your flesh in that regard. But don't let
[4:37] your driving focus become propping this
[4:41] old body up. It's going to fail you.
[4:43] It's going to deteriorate. It's part of
[4:46] God's plan. It's shrinking
[4:49] away.
[4:50] Hallelujah. How could you be excited
[4:53] about that? because it has to give way
[4:55] to another body that's already
[4:59] mine. It's already
[5:02] mine. This one has to give way. So,
[5:04] whatever part of the tripartate man you
[5:06] feed the most is the one that's going to
[5:09] rule the roost.
[5:11] And if you're spending your time putting
[5:13] wood on the fire of gossip and
[5:15] contention and criticism,
[5:19] the soul is thriving and the spirit man
[5:22] is crying out for help. Feed that spirit
[5:26] man.
