[0:00] oh
[0:05] [Music]
[0:18] [Music]
[0:37] praise the Lord I'm Pastor Steven Shelly
[0:39] and you're watching the Eagles cry I
[0:42] want to welcome you to the broadcast
[0:44] today and I want to tell you what a
[0:46] privilege it is to come to you here on
[0:49] this fine Christian television network
[0:52] I'm so happy to be a part of the
[0:54] ministry of this network sharing the
[0:57] gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00] throughout the nations of the world and
[1:03] I'm excited because I believe there's a
[1:06] lot of activity in the realm of the
[1:08] spirit and I believe that we are
[1:10] approaching probably the most exciting
[1:13] time in the history of mankind I know
[1:16] that if you read the news or you watch
[1:19] the television news you will see that
[1:22] the world is shaking and groaning wars
[1:25] and rumors of wars Global threats of
[1:29] terrorism
[1:30] signs in the skies Heavens wonders you
[1:34] know it's really the Bible just coming
[1:37] to fulfillment and reality before our
[1:40] eyes Okay preacher then why would you
[1:43] say it's an exciting time and perhaps
[1:46] the best time well there's never been a
[1:48] more appropriate hour for the Lord Jesus
[1:51] Christ to embody himself by the holy
[1:54] spirit in a body of Believers in a
[1:57] corporate people all over the world
[1:59] those who are washed in the blood of the
[2:01] Lamb Sanctified by the washing of the
[2:04] water of the word filled with the
[2:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire to
[2:09] embody that company of Believers and use
[2:12] them for a harvest yes it's time now for
[2:17] souls to come in to the kingdom of God
[2:20] because we are living in the end time
[2:23] there are uncertainties of course we
[2:25] don't know every detail of what tomorrow
[2:28] holds but I I want to remind you those
[2:31] of you who have Blessed Assurance of
[2:34] your relationship with the Lord Jesus
[2:36] Christ I want to remind you that he is
[2:39] the one holding tomorrow and because of
[2:42] that we can rest in him we can take our
[2:45] rest in the Lord Jesus Christ I believe
[2:49] that we are swiftly approaching an hour
[2:52] where we will re will we will see a
[2:55] return of the spirit and power of Elijah
[2:59] in a corporate body of people that are
[3:02] being prepared even right now as we
[3:05] speak they're still in the fire those
[3:08] purifying fires of trials and
[3:12] tribulation but they're coming out of
[3:14] that fire just around the corner and
[3:17] when they do they're going to be filled
[3:19] with a new kind of fire the fire and
[3:22] power of God to heal the sick raise the
[3:27] Dead Set captives free and fulfill that
[3:31] portion of scripture concerning the end
[3:33] time and what God wants to do in and
[3:37] through a body of people if you don't
[3:39] know the Lord Jesus Christ if you have
[3:42] not trusted him in his power to save you
[3:46] and to deliver you you can do it now you
[3:49] don't have to wait until you can join a
[3:52] church or get to a preacher I pray that
[3:56] God will lead you in finding a body of
[3:59] people that you can in fellowship with
[4:01] because that's absolutely important to
[4:03] be strengthened I certainly believe that
[4:06] but you don't have to wait until Sunday
[4:08] to call on the name of the Lord you can
[4:10] call on him now right where you are and
[4:14] he will hear you and forgive your sins
[4:17] and set you free from the powers of
[4:21] Darkness that desire to reside in your
[4:25] life not only to reside there Satan is
[4:28] out to destroy you but greater is he
[4:31] once you get him in once you invite him
[4:34] in Greater is he that is in you than he
[4:38] that is in the world I want to begin a
[4:40] series today on the spirit and power of
[4:45] Elijah and in order to do that we're
[4:47] going to study past present and future
[4:52] we want to look at the Elijah of the Old
[4:55] Testament we want to examine some of his
[4:58] characteristics and attributes we also
[5:02] want to look at some scriptures that
[5:04] tell us that the spirit and power of
[5:08] Elijah will be of of such importance
[5:12] that it will not just visit the Earth as
[5:15] it did in in the historical scriptures
[5:18] but that there will actually be a return
[5:21] and another return perhaps another
[5:24] Return of the spirit and power of Elijah
[5:28] so we're looking at another anointing
[5:31] with a specific purpose a specific
[5:34] calling and pattern that is so important
[5:37] and valued by God that in his
[5:40] sovereignty he would decide I don't just
[5:43] want this spirit in the earth once but I
[5:46] want it to return and return and return
[5:50] and return and I believe that we are
[5:53] about to see another installment of the
[5:57] spirit and power of Elijah not in just
[6:00] one man as it was in Elijah and Elisha
[6:04] and John the Baptist Etc but in a
[6:07] corporate body of people the body of
[6:10] Jesus Christ specifically the overcoming
[6:13] remnant bride now we mentioned a minute
[6:17] ago the darkness that's covering the
[6:19] Earth this was prophesied in both the
[6:22] older Covenant and the newer Covenant or
[6:24] the older Testament and what we've
[6:26] called the New Testament or newer
[6:29] Testament
[6:30] both testify of Darkness that would
[6:33] surround the Earth but what an amazing
[6:36] opportunity for you and I to arise and
[6:40] shine and reflect the glory of God you
[6:44] know what it comes down to it comes down
[6:47] to a body of people having to put in
[6:50] action what they have taught what they
[6:53] have preached what they have believed
[6:55] like my granny used to say we've got to
[6:58] practice what we PR prach and it's time
[7:01] for those who name the name of the Lord
[7:04] those who have experienced the power of
[7:06] God through salvation to arise perhaps
[7:10] you have you know become a little slack
[7:12] it happens maybe you're in a slumbering
[7:15] state and so I ask that the holy spirit
[7:18] of God will come to you right now and
[7:21] awaken you out of your sleep out of your
[7:24] lethargy that he will shake you and
[7:27] anoint you and encourage encourage you
[7:30] and Empower you to move forward I know
[7:33] you've been through a lot how do you
[7:35] know that you don't know me preacher
[7:37] well I tell you what I know I know that
[7:39] the body of Christ all over the world
[7:41] has been in the fire I know that I know
[7:45] that it feels like the fires of
[7:47] persecution it feels like even fires of
[7:50] Destruction but what it really boils
[7:53] down to is the fire of God purifying us
[7:58] getting us ready so that when Satan
[8:00] comes he will not find anything in us
[8:04] that agrees with him but all that is in
[8:08] us will only agree with the Lord Jesus
[8:11] Christ that is the deepest desire of my
[8:14] heart and I've been I've been following
[8:17] the Lord a long time since I was a
[8:19] seven-year-old boy and yet I feel God
[8:22] dealing in my heart and in my life right
[8:25] now at this particular moment I'm being
[8:28] a little transparent with you because I
[8:31] love you and I want to help you I want
[8:33] to encourage you in this hour I feel God
[8:36] dealing in my life in a deeper way than
[8:39] I have felt him in a long time now it's
[8:42] not always easy when God comes and puts
[8:45] his finger on some things in your life
[8:48] that he wants to uh extract that he
[8:51] wants you to expel to get rid of uh it's
[8:55] not always easy to see yourself Through
[8:58] The Eyes of God's word word or Through
[9:00] The Eyes of the Holy Spirit but when you
[9:02] do you're helpless you can't fix
[9:05] yourself you can't change the things
[9:08] about you that are not like you'd like
[9:10] for them to be not really because
[9:13] they're rooted deeply in in our soul but
[9:17] what we can do is allow the work of the
[9:20] Holy Spirit you know we kind of have to
[9:23] take our hands off the off the steering
[9:25] wheel of our automobile and let let God
[9:28] Drive let him be in charge let him be in
[9:32] control and when he puts his finger on
[9:35] something in your life in my life that
[9:39] that that he's not happy with that
[9:41] disappoints him that brings him pain
[9:44] what we have to do then is allow him to
[9:47] finish the work you know pinpointing
[9:50] where we need change is only part of the
[9:53] process in fact that's the easiest part
[9:55] of the process it's when God reaches in
[9:58] and begins to pull it out by the roots
[10:01] and I don't know if you're if you're a
[10:03] gardener or not but I confess it's
[10:06] something that I enjoy doing I don't get
[10:09] enough time to do it like I really have
[10:11] enjoyed in times past but I know that
[10:15] when you're pulling a weed out of the
[10:17] garden uh we have something called crab
[10:20] grass that that runs it'll it'll jump in
[10:23] the flower bed you know and just run
[10:25] right through it and you start pulling
[10:27] that up and it keeps coming and keeps
[10:29] coming and keeps coming and uh you're
[10:32] surprised sometime how long that root
[10:35] system is but if you don't get that
[10:38] thing out and every little root attached
[10:41] you'll come back later and find that it
[10:44] is growing again and thriving again
[10:48] because you maybe removed everything
[10:51] above the dirt and perhaps you even
[10:53] remove part of the roots but you left
[10:56] something in there underneath the
[10:58] surface and it's thriving again and
[11:01] taking over The Garden of your heart so
[11:05] allow the Holy Spirit to lay the axe to
[11:07] the root of the tree let him go as deep
[11:11] as he needs to go get that root dig it
[11:14] right out you know as I said that I I I
[11:17] saw something in the eye of my spirit
[11:20] and I saw uh one of my sons with a
[11:23] splinter it just came to me a splinter
[11:26] in his finger I've had one in mine but
[11:29] having four children they've all had one
[11:32] uh at one time or another and sometimes
[11:35] large I had my youngest son running out
[11:39] in the woods barefooted and stepped on a
[11:42] really a stump and a real big piece of
[11:46] of wood went right up in his foot and
[11:49] you know we love our children and we
[11:51] don't like for them to suffer and when I
[11:53] found out what had happened I reacted in
[11:56] a very silly way you know what I said I
[11:59] said to him you'll never play in the
[12:01] woods again I'll never let you run
[12:03] barefooted in the yard again now wasn't
[12:06] that a silly thing he's a boy he's he's
[12:09] going to want to run through the woods
[12:10] and I want him to and I don't always
[12:13] want him to have to wear shoes either
[12:15] but that was my first reaction but once
[12:18] we were able to get all that dug out I
[12:21] think he had to go to the emergency room
[12:23] that time there was so much of it once
[12:25] all that is dug out and the wound is is
[12:28] clean C and it's bandag so that no more
[12:32] dirt can get in that wound begins to
[12:34] heal and uh as as hard as it is you know
[12:38] I've gone in with the tweezers to try to
[12:40] dig them out and that's not easy because
[12:43] you you know that your child is hurting
[12:45] in the process but you also know that
[12:48] it's necessary to ignore it would cause
[12:51] infection it has to be dealt with oh
[12:54] holy spirit of God we want to give you
[12:57] full Sway and Our Lives to deal with us
[13:01] to get to the root of the issue that's
[13:04] hindering our fellowship with you with
[13:07] God and our fellowship with one another
[13:10] and if you'll commit to do your part and
[13:13] that's really let go and let God that's
[13:15] your part he'll do his part I know that
[13:19] I know above all things God is faithful
[13:23] there are many things we could say about
[13:25] God but one of the most important things
[13:27] that I know about him and his character
[13:30] his attributes is he is
[13:33] faithful uh faithful in a way that you
[13:36] know really we humans we're not really
[13:39] capable of being faithful like God is
[13:42] but we sure try to be faithful in all
[13:44] things but God never misses he never
[13:47] misses an appointment he never forgets
[13:50] your prayer needs or your prayer request
[13:53] he never forgets to keep the Earth in
[13:55] its orbit and and the stars shining and
[13:58] all the things that to go on and and in
[14:00] the Earth as it continues to go God is
[14:03] just a sovereign and good and faithful
[14:06] God and I just encourage you to Bow
[14:09] before him humble your heart before him
[14:12] and let his word work in you let his
[14:16] blood cover even a multitude of sin if
[14:20] you're bound if you're addicted if you
[14:23] have issues that you are not able to uh
[14:26] be free from allow the work of God to
[14:30] have full control in your life and he
[14:33] will do what only he can do and when you
[14:37] get to that place and when I get to that
[14:39] place when the corporate body of Jesus
[14:42] Christ begins to get to that place where
[14:45] we have been purified by his refining
[14:48] fire I believe that is the hour that we
[14:52] will see The Return of the spirit and
[14:55] power of Elijah to to demonstrate
[14:59] yes to demonstrate the works of God but
[15:03] also to set in action One Sweep final
[15:08] sweep of harvest and uh after that I
[15:13] believe the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[15:15] going home to the marriage supper of the
[15:18] lamb and the scriptures record what will
[15:22] happen on the earth in the earth during
[15:25] that period of time and it looks black
[15:27] and it looks bleak but then our Lord
[15:30] comes back with the redeemed praise God
[15:33] he comes on a White Horse He Who is
[15:36] faithful and true and uh puts a stop to
[15:39] some pretty awful Warfare going on in
[15:42] the Earth at that time the Earth gets a
[15:45] renovation in the future as you know and
[15:48] Jesus our lord Yeshua our Messiah Reigns
[15:52] from Jerusalem in a glorious 1,000 years
[15:57] of peace you know sometimes when we talk
[16:01] about that uh it feels to us like a
[16:04] fairy tale it it it seems like a good
[16:07] novel that someone wrote a good piece of
[16:10] fiction but I want you to know that it
[16:13] is as real as anything has ever been I
[16:17] believe that with all of my heart that
[16:20] that these promises that we have are
[16:22] sure and that we're going to see yes
[16:26] there's going to be some more shaking in
[16:28] in the earth Peril and Terror I want you
[16:32] to know I fully acknowledged that we're
[16:34] going to see the rise of the Antichrist
[16:37] and the Antichrist system we're going to
[16:40] see false religion grow all over the
[16:44] world uh so similar to the wheat the
[16:48] Bible describes the tear so similar to
[16:51] the wheat that that many people could be
[16:54] deceived into thinking that they have
[16:57] the right Faith the right religion when
[17:00] in all actuality they have joined
[17:03] themselves with a false system a harlot
[17:07] system of false religion and so we know
[17:11] that if it is indeed the one prophesied
[17:14] by the Scripture it has to look very
[17:17] similar in many aspects to the original
[17:20] Faith to to the word of God to the
[17:23] triumphant church that the Bible
[17:26] describes and so that disqualifies a lot
[17:29] of religions and that's not to say that
[17:31] the enemy won't have his way in using
[17:34] many religions many denominational
[17:37] systems to distract people from the true
[17:41] church but when that Antichrist system
[17:44] uh takes its Authority in the earth it
[17:47] will be very similar the Bible describes
[17:50] to the original faith and that's how
[17:52] many will be deceived but I have a
[17:54] promise and I want to share it with you
[17:57] and that is the Bible said that the
[18:00] elect of God would not be deceived it
[18:03] says they would be deceived if it were
[18:08] possible you know that is a big if if if
[18:13] if it were possible and I happen to
[18:16] believe that it will not be possible for
[18:19] the true genuine elected bride of Jesus
[18:23] Christ to be deceived and so uh what
[18:27] should we do if we have this idea that
[18:30] we're being called to that Holy Remnant
[18:33] the first thing we need to do is lay
[18:34] down our lives again just like we did
[18:37] when we got saved Just Surrender again
[18:39] and say Lord I'm beginning to recognize
[18:42] that I have a higher Destiny in my life
[18:45] and I lay it down I just want to lay my
[18:47] life down before you and I'm going to
[18:49] wait on you to pick it up and use it in
[18:52] any way that you see fit well I'm having
[18:55] such a good time just sharing with you
[18:57] almost like we were sharing a good cup
[19:00] of coffee together or uh a nice piece of
[19:04] pie but I guess I better get to the
[19:06] scripture here because I want to lay a
[19:09] little foundation for the series that
[19:11] we're beginning I'm going to start in
[19:14] the Book of Malachi that's that little
[19:17] prophetic book just before what we call
[19:22] the New Testament it it's it's uh the
[19:25] last book of the Old Testament Malachi
[19:28] chapter 4 beginning in verse 4 all the
[19:32] way to verse 6 let's read it remember ye
[19:36] the law of Moses my servant which I
[19:39] commanded unto him in Horeb for all
[19:44] Israel with the statutes and judgments
[19:47] verse five behold I will send you Elijah
[19:53] the prophet before the coming of the
[19:57] great and Dreadful day of the Lord now
[20:01] this was many years after the Prophet
[20:05] Elijah had lived on the earth and had
[20:08] already been caught up into heaven as we
[20:12] read in the scripture and yet Malachi
[20:15] says Elijah will come again before the
[20:20] coming of the great and Dreadful day of
[20:23] the Lord and then verse six and we're
[20:26] going to refer to verse six probably
[20:29] many times over the course of the next
[20:32] few broadcast and he shall turn the
[20:36] hearts of the fathers to the children
[20:40] and the Heart of the children to their
[20:44] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[20:49] with a curse lest I come and smite the
[20:54] Earth with a curse now this sounds like
[20:58] an extremely prophetic and important
[21:03] event that will preedee the great and
[21:07] Dreadful day of the Lord and so if it's
[21:12] that important in Scripture that it
[21:14] forer runs that great and Dreadful day
[21:17] of the Lord then we should examine it to
[21:21] see what it means has it already been
[21:24] completely fulfilled and has no future
[21:28] application at all or is there a
[21:31] possibility that there have been
[21:33] installments of fulfillment through the
[21:37] church ages Through The Years starting
[21:40] with Elisha who was uh the follower or
[21:44] the student of Elijah the prophet then
[21:47] moving to John the Baptist is there a
[21:50] possibility that uh at the end of the
[21:52] church ages there has also already been
[21:57] a return of the spirit and power of
[22:00] Elijah are we uh truly expecting and
[22:04] should we be expecting that there will
[22:06] be another installment in the last day
[22:09] army of the Lord and then the scripture
[22:11] talks about those two witnesses those
[22:14] two Olive branches one of whom will be
[22:18] Elijah or at least have the spirit of
[22:21] Elijah that's another installment and so
[22:24] uh this is interesting an interesting
[22:27] study to me I often have thought about
[22:30] why not why not the return of the spirit
[22:33] of of Isaiah uh why not the return of
[22:36] the spirit of Joshua or some of the
[22:39] other great men Malachi for instance
[22:42] this great prophet we're reading from
[22:44] today and we could go on and on but only
[22:48] two uh mentioned in the scripture who
[22:51] will have a a continued kind of ministry
[22:56] at least by the release of their spirit
[22:58] and That Was Elijah and in some manner
[23:02] also Moses and so there must be
[23:05] something in the anointing and the
[23:08] calling that were on those two men's
[23:10] lives that God said Sending uh two men
[23:15] one time with that Spirit into the Earth
[23:17] is not enough it needs to go back and
[23:20] back and back and each time the spirit
[23:23] and power of Elijah returned to the
[23:25] Earth they accomplish the same kind of
[23:28] ministry and it is a Ministry of
[23:32] reconciliation it is a Ministry of
[23:34] exposure because it exposes the fallacy
[23:38] of false religion and lukewarm
[23:41] Christianity it exposes false
[23:44] Doctrine uh it brings somewhat judgment
[23:48] to the to the prophets of ba it it it
[23:52] accomplishes quite a few things and uh
[23:55] one of the things that we think about
[23:57] because of the life and commission of
[24:00] John the Baptist which we'll talk about
[24:02] in a future broadcast was to prepare a
[24:05] people for the Lord and so this Spirit
[24:08] of Elijah and power of Elijah is to
[24:12] prepare a people for the Lord for the
[24:15] coming of the Lord a full Redemption of
[24:18] a body of people to be presented to the
[24:21] Lord as his treasure as his inheritance
[24:24] oh this this baffles me that I could be
[24:28] a treasure uh that I could be what Jesus
[24:32] will
[24:33] inherit I look at my life I look at at
[24:36] you know what I've been through and
[24:39] sometimes struggle to keep my spirit
[24:41] right and I think oh some inheritance
[24:44] you know I I'm not I'm not you know
[24:46] really that valuable that big of a
[24:49] treasure that the Lord would would would
[24:51] inherit that he would earn and yet he
[24:54] doesn't see it that way at all that's
[24:56] the blessing he doesn't see it that way
[24:59] at all because he sees me as fully
[25:02] purchased fully redeemed fully Walking
[25:06] In His Image how is that possible
[25:09] because he sees me through the filter of
[25:12] his blood when he sees me we used to
[25:15] sing this song often when he sees me he
[25:18] sees the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah he
[25:22] sees me as worthy and not as I am he
[25:26] views me in garments
[25:28] as white as the snow for the Lamb of God
[25:32] is worthy and he washed me this I know
[25:37] that's how he can see me through the
[25:38] blood because that's the cleansing agent
[25:42] that has washed me and made me whole and
[25:45] he's not finished with me yet he's not
[25:48] finished with you yet and yet when he
[25:50] sees me he sees me completed perfected
[25:54] In His Image and he knows that His Holy
[25:59] Spirit and his blood and his word his
[26:02] sanctifying power is more than enough to
[26:05] accomplish what else needs to be
[26:08] accomplished in my life so that I could
[26:10] truly be his peculiar treasure that
[26:14] valuable Pearl in the field and that's
[26:17] what God is looking for that's what he
[26:19] is uh searching out in this hour and you
[26:22] and I get to be a part of that praise
[26:24] God I want to say that when we examine
[26:28] the word spirit and power we begin to
[26:31] learn a lot about what should and will
[26:35] be accomplished each and every time the
[26:38] spirit of Elijah and power of Elijah
[26:41] returns to the earth I have to go
[26:43] already but I want to pray as we go off
