He is here. &gt;&gt; That's right. to meet every need that you have. Not one left undone. Just by the lifting of the hand, acknowledge, I have needs. The Lord sees the hand out across the stream. The Lord sees the needs that you have. He is not forgetful. I may forget, but he doesn't. All the loneliness that you may feel because you don't have companions around you. Let Jesus draw near to you today. Minister to your needs out across this camera. Would you remember this morning the family of brother Mike Orders from the church at uh Ruth, North Carolina, longtime friend, precious brother, song leader for three pastors there who went to be with the Lord after only three weeks of knowing that he was that sick. Would you ask the Lord to be with his whole family, his wife, Sister Susan or had a stroke some years ago and doesn't is not able to speak &gt;&gt; and um I know this is going to be very painful and has been very painful for her and the daughters and their families and the church family because he was a fixture &gt;&gt; for the missionary camps and even youth camps years ago. We have quite a few traveling this weekend. Baby showers in Mississippi and uh some in Indiana and various other places. Let's pray that God will protect them and keep them on the road. &gt;&gt; Uh pray for our fellowship meetings next weekend. Yes. &gt;&gt; We need a breakthrough that's deeper than a feeling, deeper than an emotion. Yes. &gt;&gt; We need God to show up, &gt;&gt; search our hearts, and prepare us for what he wants to do. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Let's take these needs to the Lord today. &gt;&gt; Sister Sharon, &gt;&gt; I'm so sorry. Sister Sharon is very sick this morning. She is not well at all. Needs to be remembered to the Lord in prayer. She wears her body out helping take care of other people. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And she really needs a touch this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. Do that for our sister. [Music] &gt;&gt; He is here. Amen. He is here. Holy, holy. I will bless his name again. He is here. Listen closely. Hear him calling out your name. He is here. You can touch him. and you will never be. Sing again. Oh, he is here. Hallelu, [Music] he is here. Amen. He is here. Holy, holy, I will bless his name again. He is here. Listen closely. Hear him calling out your name. He is here and you can touch him. You will never be. [Music] Before we do the prayer, can we sing the second verse? I search for peace among the shadows so dark and lonely. Did you look for him? I gave up on finding any strong or lasting love. [Music] I tasteed all the things that sin could think to offer me. But today I'll feast on mana from above. And why? Because he is here. Oh hallelu [Music] he is here. Oh amen. [Music] He is here. Holy, holy. We will bless your name again. Oh, he is here. Won't you listen closely? Hear him calling out your name. He is here and you can touch him. You will never be the same. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, as we come before you this morning, Lord, we have so much to be thankful for. &gt;&gt; Reflect on the words of the song, Lord. And I I foolishly went looking for satisfaction in things in the world. I confess, Lord, that I made many mistakes, but you were greater. &gt;&gt; You called us when we were young. Lord, I believe there are many here that have that testimony that they've heard the call of God on their life, and they know that the only true way and living way is found in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Lord, you're our healer this morning. &gt;&gt; You're our provider. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that we have need of we can't find in you. There's no sickness that you can't heal. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, when brother Brandon was preaching here across the nation, he said that you couldn't heal us today because you did it already. &gt;&gt; We believe your word. We believe that when Isaiah prophesied about you taking those straes, that it was a finished work when you took those stripes. So today, we lay hold of that promise, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we testify once again that the world does not satisfy us, God. There's no job, there's no house, there's no car, there's no bank account, Lord, that would satisfy us. We come here today because we found that our only satisfaction is in you. &gt;&gt; You're the peacem maker, Lord, in times of trouble. You speak to the storm when it's out of control. You comfort the hearts in our loss today. Lord, there's prayer requests that have been made mentioned and we bring them before you believing you're the only one that can truly comfort. Lord, we might speak words, but if your presence were to come to those people like your presence came to us this morning, oh God, &gt;&gt; may you help us, oh God, &gt;&gt; may you grant us greater revelation of the way that you have provided. &gt;&gt; May we become what you are. We know you're the yes and the amen, but may we become the yes and the amen to you, Lord. May we stand on your side. If there were a line drawn today, oh God, may we cross the line to stand with you. May we stand with your word. And if you show us something today that we find as we look at the word of God and we see a reflection that's unlike you, we ask you to bring the pruning shear, Lord. Cut it off, cut it out, get the grubbing ho, Lord. Whatever it takes, set us free of oursel that you might have your way in our life. &gt;&gt; We need you, oh God. We need you. There's no God like our God. &gt;&gt; We look to you for provision. We look to you for healing. And we claim all these promises today because you did it for us, not because and simply because we couldn't do it for oursel. &gt;&gt; Lord, you are the burning lamp. You're all of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We believe you're here today. Will you have your way? May every person be seated in their seat with that magnifying glass. Not for shame or not for reproach or not for embarrassment, Lord, but that you would be better reflected at the end of the day when we step in front of the mirror. We say, "I I look a little bit more like my king today. I'm dressed in the robes of his word today." By your grace, we'll praise you for it. For we believe you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. And that you want a bride prepared. Thank you, Lord. We ask it all in the lovely name of our Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I bless your name. [Music] I bless your name. I give you honor, [Music] give you praise. [Music] You are the life, the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. Some midnight hour. If you should find you're in a prison [Music] in your mind. [Music] Reach out and praise. defy those chains [Music] and they will fall in Jesus name. Can you lift your hands and sing to the Lord? I bless your name. I bless your name. I give you honor. Give you praise. You are the life, the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. You are the life, the truth, the way. You are the life, the truth, the way. I bless your name. I bless your name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Praise you, Lord. We bless you, Jesus. We bless you, Jesus. [Applause] Oh Lord, you healed our body. You healed our mind. You gave us grace when we didn't deserve grace. Lord, you lifted us up when we were in the midst. You brought us up now, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, we praise you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Precious Lord, &gt;&gt; you may have your seats today. &gt;&gt; Precious Jesus. &gt;&gt; Brother Kate is getting ready to lead us as we continue worshiping the Lord. We're going to give as giving unto the Lord with our tithe and offering. &gt;&gt; We're so thankful for what he is doing, what the Lord Jesus is doing. &gt;&gt; We're glad that you're here in the house of the Lord with us. Jason, it's good to see you and Kelly and Jaden today. We've missed you. So glad that you're here today. Uh brother Jerry, it's good to see you and your mother. We're glad that the Lord is healing you and bringing you on through. Sister Lily with her children Caleb and Aaliyah. We're glad that they're here just a few days before the meeting. Going to stay uh for a few days after. We're glad that they're here, but we're just glad as a body that we're gathered together in the presence of the Lord, knowing that he is the same yesterday and today and tomorrow and the next day. I may not know about tomorrow. I don't know what tomorrow holds. I don't know what the next five minutes holds, but I'm in his presence. And so whatever he wants to do, I want to be moldable and yieldable in his hands because I know that if I place my life in his hands, though I may not know what tomorrow might hold, I know that if I'll just place myself in his hands, everything will be all right. Whatever comes, it doesn't come to stay. It comes to be behind me. Because what was yesterday is now yesterday. It's behind me. And I'm facing today with the grace and the goodness of God the same as I will tomorrow. But why worry about tomorrow? Tomorrow will take care of itself. I'm here today in the presence of the Lord to do what he wants me to do. I'm thankful and grateful for his good grace. Brother Elas, will you come? and Ian will let these two brothers come to you today for the tithe and the offering. Our our Jerusalem rent payment, the quarterly payment is due this week. And so, uh, we're a little bit short. If you have anything that the Lord would lay on your heart to to tuck in today to add to it, we'd be so thankful. We don't understand everything that the Lord calls us to do, but we just try to be obedient to the calling, knowing that he, the one that called us, is able to accomplish what he wants to accomplish. Let's worship together as we're getting ready for the preaching of the word. &gt;&gt; This is just a simple song. Sing it with me. You believe he's born a spirit out. Lord, I seek you. Help me find you. How I need your touch. Find my dry broken places thirsty for your love. Lord, forgive me if I've wondered far away from you. [Music] You are all I ever needed. Come and make me new. Pour your spirit out on me and fall just like the rain. Oh, saturate my thirsty soul. Come and fall arrest on me. Come fill my cup again. Oh, come and heal my heart and make me whole. I need you now. Pour your spirit out. Oh Lord, I seek you. Help me find you. How I need your touch. Find my drying, broken places, thirsty for your love. Lord, forgive me if I've wondered far away from you. [Music] You are all I ever needed. Come and make me new. Pour your spirit out on me and fall just like the rain. Oh, won't you saturate my thirsty soul? Come and fall and rest on me. Come fill my cup again. Oh, and heal my heart. Lord, make me whole. Oh Lord, I need you now. Pour your spirit out. Pour your spirit out on me. Fall just like the rain. Oh, saturate my thirsty soul. Come and fall fresh on me. Come fill this cup again. Oh, won't you heal my heart and make me whole. I need you now. Pour your spirit out, Lord. Pour your spirit out on me and fall just like the rain. Yes. Come saturate my thirsty. So come and fall on me and fill my cup again. Oh, won't you heal my heart and make me whole. Oh Lord, I need you now. Pour your spirit out. I need you now. Pour your spirit out. And Lord, I lift your name. It's your hoby name. Your Jehovah God, my Elohim. [Music] And you're the great I am. You're the reason I lamb. You're my comforter [Music] and king. [Music] for our lives. Your name, it's your holy name, my Jehovah and my God. You're my Elohim. You're the great I am. You're the reason. You're my comforter.

[Music] &gt;&gt; My God, &gt;&gt; my Jehovah and my God, my el. [Music] You're the great I am. &gt;&gt; You're the reason. [Music] You're my comfort. &gt;&gt; Yes, you are in my king. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes you are. Yes, you are. &gt;&gt; You came from heaven to earth to show the way &gt;&gt; from the earth to the cross. &gt;&gt; My pain. From the cross to the grave and from the grave to the sky. Lord, I lift your name on high. One more time. You came from heaven to earth to show the way. From the earth to the cross. My destiny. From the cross on to the grave. From the grave to the sky. Lord, I lift your name on. &gt;&gt; Lord, I lift your name. Lord, I lift your name on high. &gt;&gt; Come on. We want to lift up your holy name. [Music] You're holy. You are holy, Jesus. You are holy, Lord. You deserve the highest praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He's wonderful and worthy &gt;&gt; to be praised. Just play a moment. I want you to just take a moment, just a moment, and I want you to examine your own heart just a little more in the monitor. I want you to examine your own heart. I've carefully watched this body this morning watching other people. I'm so thankful that we were able to push through some of that in praise and in worship and a beautiful atmosphere was created for most of us. But I watched how many people are watching other people when it's time to be watching him. That's right. &gt;&gt; I want you to examine your own heart. This is not a a judgment and it's certainly not condemnation at all. It's doing my job. It's doing what I was called to do. I want you to examine your heart just a moment. And I want you to ask yourself, why am I here this morning? Am I here because I felt a religious duty to be here? Am I here because I didn't want to disappoint my pastor? Am I here because I'm leading my family and I I've got to be an example before them? Am I here because I didn't want to be talked about? Am I here because I understand what this time is about? It's about him. It's about feasting in his presence &gt;&gt; and it's about applying his word. The reality is every one of us could be somewhere else. We could be at the lake. We could be on the beach. We could be at the ball game. We could be in front of Netflix. But we're here and we need to know why this morning. We need to know why we're here. Was it somebody else's expectation that motivated you to push and get here? Or was it a heart that desires him? Above all things, you desire him. Maybe you came to please a loved one. That's not enough. It's just simply not enough. May maybe maybe it's because it's what you've always done. Well, the only way that that does us any good is if we're satisfied with where we are. Because if we always do what we've always done, we'll always be what we've always been. And I don't think that's any of our testimony today. Uh I feel that every one of us who are sincere before the Lord would say, "I've got to have more of you, Lord. I've got to have more of you, Jesus. I've got to have more of you, Lord. I've got to live this thing out &gt;&gt; day after day. So, search your heart. I'll give you just a few moments of quiet. Just just a little moment or two. Search your heart. Why are you here? What did you come for? What did you come to receive? What did you come to give? [Music] If you've come up with an answer that's different from what you would like for it to be, would you just ask the Lord now? Just ask ask him. I I think it's appropriate to say, "Lord, forgive me if I was motivated by anything other than a deep love and a hunger for you and who you are and desiring to be with your presence. If for any other reason, Lord, I repent of that. It might be well-intention. It might not be in itself a sin to do it for somebody else, but you'll miss what God has for you if you're here for any other reason. So Lord, we just pray that you would help us and forgive our hearts if we have been motivated by any other thing and that you will redeem the time that we now have together. And you will give us grace to feast on your word and apply it first to our own lives before we even consider somebody else's failure or shortcoming. and we'll we'll praise you for this. It's it's it's your finger in our heart that we desire, pointing us to whatever it is that we need to lay open and bear before you today. Help us, King Jesus. Help us, King Jesus. Now, sing another chorus of that if you would before we go to the word this morning. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, lamb. Let this be your opportunity to just tell him how much you love him for another moment. God bless you as you do that. [Music] &gt;&gt; From the earth to the cross, my destiny from the cross to the grave. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; And from the grave to the sky. &gt;&gt; Lord, I lift your name. &gt;&gt; I lift up your name. &gt;&gt; Oh, you came from heaven to earth to show the way from the earth to the cross. I destipate. From the cross to the grave. From the grave to the sky. Lord, I one more time. You came from heaven to earth. You came from heaven to earth to show the way to show the way. &gt;&gt; From the earth. &gt;&gt; From the earth to the cross. &gt;&gt; My debt to pay. my death. And from the cross on to the grave, from the grave to the sky. Lord, I lift your name on high. [Music] Lift your name on high. &gt;&gt; Lord, I lift your name on high. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I lift your name on high. Hallelujah. We lift your name on high, Lord. Hallelujah. Let's thank the Lord for these musicians. Now, do do you see what you did? you you instead of uh entering into a place of freedom, you sort of tightened down. And and maybe it's because you felt on the spot. But I don't want you to feel on the spot. You're not here for me, but I'm not here to play either. &gt;&gt; This is my life. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand this is my life. This isn't what I do for a paycheck. No, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, no, sir. Amen. I was going through the history uh this week, spending some time putting some things together and trying to organize over 200,000 pictures. Can you imagine? And picking just a few from the different eras and the and the different decades and periods of being together as a body. And I came across a time when there just wasn't any money. I mean, way back, there just wasn't any money. And we were I mean, we were just barely getting through, just barely getting by. I had a small inheritance left over from my grandmother. And that's what I lived on. That's what I paid bills with because we were fighting and struggling. And to think that we have come this far to where the campground and the church and the equipment and the and is paid for &gt;&gt; and the grace of God is among us, it's an unbelievable journey. But if we lose our identity as a separate people, as a separated people, if we lose our identity uh and become one of a bunch, then then it's all in vain. If we don't know why we came this morning, then we haven't come very far spiritually at all. So maybe we've come far with technology and maybe we've come far financially, but we we must know that we are on a spiritual journey. &gt;&gt; This is this is everything to us. &gt;&gt; This is our way. This is our eternity that's being prepared. &gt;&gt; This is not about today or tomorrow, folks. &gt;&gt; This is about all eternity, what we're building here uh this morning. And so I want to ask you now, don't don't shut down because uh you had a little bit of a a corrective word to try to pull us back into course and then maybe clamp down and and punish the preacher this morning. You you might not want to do such a thing as that, &gt;&gt; but yet just say, "Lord, I I can't speak for anybody else. I'm not responsible for, but I know why I'm here. I'm here to have a word change my life. &gt;&gt; I plan to do something about what I hear. And I believe most of you, many of you do. I want to encourage you not to watch one another. Doesn't matter who what they're doing. Somebody said, "My praise is hindered by watching somebody else." Well, that's a simple solution. &gt;&gt; You don't need to ask me about it. Stop watching them. &gt;&gt; Get your eyes off of them. It's it's none of your business how somebody else worships the Lord, &gt;&gt; whether they're worthy to do it or not worthy or I'm I don't know that I'm worthy to worship him, but he calls me. &gt;&gt; So, keep your eyes off of one another if you're going to overcome. and uh apply every word of God to your life first, &gt;&gt; then to your family, &gt;&gt; your house first, &gt;&gt; and then if you have time, I I think that'll keep us really busy. &gt;&gt; But if you have any leftover time, then you can look around and see if somebody else is doing just right. This morning, it's about you and him. &gt;&gt; If you believe that, say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Let's open our Bibles this morning. if you have them with you. I want to read again Psalm 66 10 11 and 12. I want to read again Jeremiah 48:11 and then we will uh go into the portion of this series for today. Psalm 66:10-12. For thou, oh God, this is the scripture that the Lord has given for the vessel of misunderstanding. For thou, oh God, hast proved us. Thou hast tried us as silver is tried. Thou broughtest us into the net. Thou ladest affliction upon our loins. Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads. We went through fire and water, but thou brought us out. You have brought us out. Is anybody here that has been brought out? &gt;&gt; Out of a sin life, &gt;&gt; out of a selfish life, out of a religious life. you have brought us out into a wealthy place or in Hebrew the word is it would also be translated a broad a wide place of provision. We could say oh God you have enlarged our borders. Aren't you glad that he has given us fresh territory in the spirit realm? I am thankful for that. And then the theme of the series, Jeremiah 48:11, Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his leaves, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity. Therefore, his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed. May God add his blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated. I know you're longing to do so. A and I would be too after standing so long. I want you to go with me again now to uh another portion of scripture if you will to the book of Nehemiah. Nehemiah. It it it's you know I was surprised I could only find one time. I must have not done a proper search. Uh, so I may be incorrect, but I could only find one time that brother Brandham just briefly, very briefly, not even a whole sentence, uh, referred to Nehemiah. It's a huge book of the Bible and not huge, but a but a fairly significant chunk of, uh, of Old Testament Bible and, uh, he was busy with other things. Thank God for that. I needed to know some other things. Amen. But not being one of those who believes that uh we are somehow limited to only speak about scriptures that he spoke about. You see God gave me the whole book before he gave me the understanding of the book. It was all mine. These scriptures are mine. All scripture is given to me to you for instruction. is profitable for for for rebuke and for uh correction and for instruction. And I'm going to ask you at the end of the service, don't let me forget to to do the birthdays and so forth. I uh wasn't able to do that in the beginning, but I don't want to I don't want to forget that. Uh so there there may be something in a passage that could not be covered in the ministry uh of of our prophet that would be of benefit for us today as well. And and you know uh I love Nehemiah. Um I don't preach about him a lot. The last time I really preached about him was 2004 and this is 2025. So that's a long time just after we moved into this building. Uh we were so happy to be here. We moved in uh in July, I think it was. And then our uh meetings followed a couple weeks after uh for the dedication and we had our first indoor camp meeting which I liked from the beginning. Just like the air conditioning from the beginning. And uh I know some people said, "Oh, it's just not the same." It is to me. It's all the same. Uh it doesn't matter whether it's uh uh uh under the tentop tabernacle or whether it's in here. But I find that uh people can listen a whole lot better when when they're comfortable or when they have to put on a sweater instead of uh instead of sweat rags on their heads, etc. Did you know I was looking as mentioned earlier through the history and we had a bunch of camp meetings in July? What was wrong with us in July? You choose to have one under the tabernacle in July. But we made it and we're thankful for every victory for all that God did. But when we first moved in this building, I preached a series on restoring the gates of Jerusalem. And I preached uh originally how how Ezra was given this opportunity to go back and to try to begin restoring the fallen and broken down city of Jerusalem. And but it was Nehemiah who who really took the commission and uh Ezra a scribe. But Nehemiah, he really had a commission from the Lord. Let us arise and build. There's something still being built. Maybe not in the physical, but there's something still being built in the spiritual this morning. A kingdom. &gt;&gt; A kingdom that is within and it is also without. A kingdom that is within individually, but it is without corporately. &gt;&gt; We are the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and so the kingdom of God is larger than the church. It's larger than even the bride for instance. It's huge. This kingdom of God, it's in the hearts of men and uh there there are those who are part of the church and they make up part of the kingdom and there are those who are part of the overcoming bride and they make up a part of the kingdom. And there are those who have not had any light except to call on the name of the Lord &gt;&gt; and find grace and forgiveness for sin. But they also have a portion, a part in the kingdom of our God. Aren't you glad? &gt;&gt; And even though many believe that there are no uh bride members left in denominational systems, uh I now have come to understand that uh there are many denominational systems that have been built around the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; So surely there must be some bride among them. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And there must be. Some are just foolish virgins and that's all they will ever be able to be. But they're part of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; But there may be some yet in the Baptist &gt;&gt; church, in the Methodist church, &gt;&gt; in the Pentecostal church. There may be some yet in the Catholic church, &gt;&gt; in the Mormon church. May God give you and I grace to be salty, to be full of light, to live our lives. God, put us in front of who you want us in front of so that everyone who's to be a part of a particular uh section of your kingdom that they would hear and come. &gt;&gt; Whatever Whatever it is, we're not the only ones who have eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I don't know about you, but I'm glad. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm glad it's not a monopoly. &gt;&gt; I'm glad aren't the only ones who have eternal life. &gt;&gt; And I'm not one of those. So, I'm not putting myself in that place. I'm a I'm a I'm a Jesus fan. &gt;&gt; I'm a Christian. &gt;&gt; In fact, I'm a Berean. If you want to know my New Testament identity, I'm one of those who was from Berea &gt;&gt; who searched the scriptures diligently and daily and often. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To to see if these things be so. &gt;&gt; And if we don't do that, we'll follow a trend &gt;&gt; instead of the leadership of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I've got to follow him. &gt;&gt; If you follow me following him, that's up to you. &gt;&gt; But I've got to follow him. &gt;&gt; I want you with all my heart. So, if you will look at Nehemiah, I love the story and I'm going to have to cut it kind of short because when I spoke on it the last time, well, it was months in the making, you know, and since I'm in another series this month, I I got to I can't hit but the highlight. Uh, but I do want your attention. Nehemiah 6 6-8. Wherein was written, it is reported among the heathen, and Gashu said it, saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel, for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words. And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah, and now shall it be reported to the king or taxis according to these words. Come now, therefore, and let us take counsel together. What are we reading? We're reading the accusations that are being leveled against Nehemiah &gt;&gt; who has no desire to be king. There is a king in Persia. We don't need a king in Judah. He has no desire to replace anybody else. He has no ambition except his heart has become broken for the destruction of the city of the Lord, the city of the king, the city of the most high God, Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; And so he is uh overwhelmed. He is consumed by a vision. He is consumed by a commission. He is consumed by a burden that he would do something to see the broken walls of Jerusalem built again. &gt;&gt; If he could see the gates of the city repaired and restored. Listen, he was not about destruction. &gt;&gt; He the bride is not about destruction. Our ministry is not about destruction. The bride's ministry is about building. &gt;&gt; We're building something. Not the kingdom of William Brham. &gt;&gt; Not the kingdom of men. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But the kingdom of our God, &gt;&gt; the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ. There is a time to men. Rend rend. There is a time to tear down. There is a time to destroy, but we're not in the destroying time now. We're in the building up hour. &gt;&gt; Sometimes things have to be ripped all the way down to the foundation so that you can check to see that you're building on a foundation that will take you all the way through. &gt;&gt; But our commission is to build. &gt;&gt; We're building in the spirit. We're building an atmosphere where he can come Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; How many of you know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Are you sure you do? &gt;&gt; We are called and commissioned to carry a burden and to have a common vision among us for for a church, for a ministry to operate with more than one vision. the vision that is presented from this holy desk &gt;&gt; and to have another vision presented from the volleyball court or from the fellowship hall &gt;&gt; or from your home &gt;&gt; that is die vision &gt;&gt; di &gt;&gt; vision and what happens when there's division people die &gt;&gt; where there is no vision singularly vision. Where there is no vision, King James translated the verse to say where there is no vision, the people &gt;&gt; perish. &gt;&gt; Perish. &gt;&gt; I wish he would have taken a closer look at the word &gt;&gt; because that word doesn't only mean perish. It means before they perish, they cast off restraint. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No standards, &gt;&gt; no boundaries. &gt;&gt; No convictions. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm going to preach it. &gt;&gt; Just every man does that which is right in his own eyes, &gt;&gt; and every man gets to choose for his own house. And it doesn't matter what they do over at the church. It doesn't matter what they believe at the church. It doesn't matter what they've given their lives to over there. I I get to make the decisions in my home. And so we will live contrary. &gt;&gt; We'll live a different way. &gt;&gt; It sounds to me like a compromise of high level. &gt;&gt; Because where there is no vision, &gt;&gt; the people perish. and they perish because they've cast off restraint. &gt;&gt; They have no no concept of what it means to be led, &gt;&gt; to be shepherded, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; To be guided, to be cared for. I don't know how many people have told me over the last 50 years, I want you to be my pastor. And I I I want you to tell me if you see anything, if you hear anything, if you feel anything, if you think anything, &gt;&gt; I want you to share that with me because I want to make it a matter of prayer and concern. And the problem is tens of thousands have asked for my help and only a half a dozen have ever come back and dismissed me. So I'm still spiritually employed &gt;&gt; by thousands of people who've called me to be a pastor, a leader in their life and they got mad or they ran here or they ran there and they never fired me. Did you know brother Random talks about Jezebel? &gt;&gt; Even Queen Jezebel had a pastor. &gt;&gt; His name was Elijah the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why was he considered to be uh Jezebel's pastor? Because he had the spiritual authority for the season over the house of Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I tell you folk, it it was a better day in Israel when she listened to the judges, to the seers, and to the prophets. &gt;&gt; But she began to to look around and see the prosperity of the other nations and the way they did things. &gt;&gt; Just like people around this message began to look around, well, all the other churches have Christmas. Well, all the other churches have cable television. Well, all the other churches have so and so. All the other churches have banquetss and all the other churches have fall festivals. And all the other churches and we ought to we ought not to be any less than any of the rest of them. Just a minute. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we'd like to be like them. The problem is there's still a few old-timers left that remember when it wasn't that way. And we long to have a word of God among us again. A word of deliverance, a word of correction, a word of a clarion call, a trumpet blast as the prophet Joel set the trumpet to thy mouth and sound an alarm and make it a clear alarm. Do it without fear or favor of man. tell the truth because only the truth will set people free. &gt;&gt; And so they congregate around a a handful of of top preachers and they know what they're going to get before they go. They know the theme. They know what's going to be preached. They know the testimonies that are going to be told. They know exactly how things are going to go. The rest of the time, the people are just reaching. Many, many are. You don't have to say amen. You may not even be qualified to say amen, but I'm qualified to say this. &gt;&gt; They're just reaching. Let us be like other nations. Let us be like other nations. We want to be like other churches. Well, other churches do it that. Well, in other churches, the pastor goes and visits everybody in their home at least once a month. And in other churches, they do it like this. And in other, you know, Israel made a fatal mistake. I said to my children this week, I know they're grown, but they're they'll always be our children if they're if they're 50 years old, which we in this life would probably never see, but they're still our children. I don't mean little toddler children. I mean they're they're our offspring. You're a child of God, aren't you? &gt;&gt; You're an offspring of God. Isn't that what the prophet tells us? We're his offspring. &gt;&gt; And I believe it. I told my children this week uh concerning this story uh of how Israel wanted a king and they just had to have a king and so God gave them what they wanted, but he wasn't a long-term righteous man. &gt;&gt; He was only righteous till he caught his glimpse of himself in the mirror and then he fell in love with who he had become. And instead of raising up memorials and monuments unto God, he began to raise up memorial and memorials and monuments unto himself, unto his family, unto the dynasty of Saul. &gt;&gt; And God began to be left out. And I said to my kids, I I I encourage you, at least the girls, I I said, I encourage you, and now I'll say it to the other to the two boys. I encourage you to listen to the sermon that brother Brandham preached in Ciagua, Ohio. Charity, I don't have the year, but you might look it up or someone can hollered out, but I don't need 30 people on their phone looking it up. I need your attention here. Uh, Ohio. He preached a message, the rejected king. And I've been to the campground in Shiagua. Brother Leadford uh from Middletown, Ohio took us out there to the campground and showed us the meeting and he was in the meeting and told us where everything was and we enjoyed the nostalgia of that moment. If you've never heard that sermon or if you haven't heard it in a long time, it's the story from God's perspective. There's the year 1960 and that is June the 10th of 1960. Chatagua. It's got ch and a q in it. The rejected king. Hear it because it's the story from God's perspective. We hear it in the Bible uh concerning Saul and how he he moved and was dealt with. And we hear it later as David and Saul interact with one another. And then as David becomes anointed king uh over over a kingdom that already has a king first time and then uh uh subsequently anointed by the divided kingdoms of Israel and then the United Kingdom. But brother Brandham preached it from God's perspective. How do you think it made the creator feel? &gt;&gt; When the people said, "We no longer want your leadership. We want a king. &gt;&gt; Did you know they already had a king? &gt;&gt; The king of kings. &gt;&gt; They already had a melaholam. &gt;&gt; Why did they think they needed an earthly king? They only thought it because they were comparing themselves with other nations. &gt;&gt; When we compare ourselves, our family with somebody else's family, we lose. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we compare our blessing with someone else's blessing, we lose. &gt;&gt; When we compare our provision with some, we lose. &gt;&gt; This is not about a competition. &gt;&gt; This is serving God &gt;&gt; with all we have &gt;&gt; and he gives us. I've always believed this when I had nothing. I still believed it that God gives us only what he can trust us with. &gt;&gt; You want more in your life provisionwise, become more trustworthy in your dealings. &gt;&gt; It's what you do with what you have &gt;&gt; that causes God to see whether or not &gt;&gt; you are trustworthy &gt;&gt; enough to have something else. Am I off the word? I don't believe so. &gt;&gt; Because he said to Israel, you're wondering why things are going hard for you. I'll tell you, you're thieves. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You've robbed God. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's why you're having such a hard time. You're robbing God. You're under a curse." &gt;&gt; He watches to see what we will do with what we have. Not only our money, but our families. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I want you to know that's one of the most valuable things that we have leadership and influence over is our own family. If we can't listen folk, if we can't make a difference in our own family, oh God, help us, &gt;&gt; help us, Lord. We don't want to win the world and lose our own family. &gt;&gt; Then we better apply I'll tell you, pride will keep you from going back to your children, sir. &gt;&gt; And apologizing for your wicked ways, &gt;&gt; but that's not that's not important. It's okay to eat uh humble pie. It's all right to eat crow. It's all right to come back and say, "I was wrong. I was I'm sorry that I did it that way. That's not the way I should have done it." And I want to tell you, I'm sorry. Now, let's get together and do it differently and better the next time. Some of you need that kind of a meeting. &gt;&gt; Some of us need that kind of meeting &gt;&gt; where we say to our family, "Oh, give us another chance. We we we no longer maybe have the authority that we once had, but give us another opportunity to set a better example before you instead of undermining you spiritually. &gt;&gt; Instead of telling other people what a a condition our our children are in spiritually a as though we're kind of telling on them or something. God have mercy on us if that's where we get our pleasure. Don't we realize that we bear a portion of the responsibility for the wake that the boat our boat of life leaves behind it? &gt;&gt; God help us in this hour. &gt;&gt; They said we got to have a king. We want to look like other nations. We want to be like other nations. God gave him a Saul. God took the kingdom back from Saul. Oh, but Saul didn't give up easy, did he? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What a mess. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a mess it was. How long it took, how much bloodshed it took to finally get the hands in the kingdom in the hands of a man who would have an eternal dynasty. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of Saul came and went. The kingdom of David came and is an eternal dynasty &gt;&gt; because the King of Kings descended &gt;&gt; and he shall sit upon an everlasting throne, the throne of David. Here's Nehemiah. He knew the promises of God concerning Jerusalem. And uh I I I just I know you maybe were distracted by for a few moments on the platform. I had my laptop going, but I I wanted to pull just a few notes that I hadn't pulled previously from the introductory sermon that I preached 21 years ago, fall 21 years ago in this church. And and and just to get a few details here that I didn't have. and one I spoke about Ezra being sent first and then approximately it was 11 years later Ezra leaves the captivity uh the Babylonian captivity that has taken the Jews to Persia and he tries to go back and but it it just is not happening and so 13 years later excuse me 11 years somewhere between 11 and 13 years later Nehemiah is in the in the palace of the king of Persia and in this royal lily city what's the name Shuan it's the same city of Mori and Padasa that we in English call Esther same city and the the Jews are still in captivity 130 years have gone by since the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar a and the Babylonian army. The temple was brought down uh until there was hardly one stone upon another stone. The city of Jerusalem was not only destroyed, the walls broken down, the gates burned up, but even what was left of the city that wasn't stone was burned. And if you would have looked at the at the stones of the wall, you would have seen them burned. And I have seen with my own eyes some of the stones that remain today from the burning of the city of Jerusalem in this period and not in the period of Titus. And there and they're still charred. You you can still see the remnant of the staining of the stones where the fire would only burn something off the surface of the stone, but of course not the stone itself. The people of Israel had settled in to Persia and they had picked up Babylonian ways. They were comfortable in this land of exile and in this land of confusion because the word Babel means confusion, confusing language, confusing speech. and they had settled in and only little handfuls of people had followed the example of Ezra and had made that journey back when they were captured out of Jerusalem. There were no airplanes to get them from Jerusalem to Shushan in Persia. They marched in chains, chained one to another, prisoners of exile. They get to uh to Babylon and they are eventually given some some I don't freedom we could say. Uh as long as you serve the kingdom empire you you won't be exactly slaves. You won't be exactly free. Hear me. &gt;&gt; You won't be exactly free, but you won't be exactly slaves either. So you won't just go and come as you will. But a little freedom is better than no freedom. Do you know what that sounds like to me today? The condition of many places. &gt;&gt; May God help it not to be the condition of this place &gt;&gt; got just enough freedom &gt;&gt; to to to to make you comfortable &gt;&gt; to cause you to want to stay in confusion. but not enough longing. &gt;&gt; Not enough longing in your heart for Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; So, you'll just live in Persia with your Babylonian ways. And you will you will uh Oh, it's nice to hear stories from home. I hear the Jews are there. I hear they hide during the day. I hear they're afraid because they're still occupying forces of of several different dynasties that roam the ruins of Jerusalem. And so the Jews are mostly in and out hiding. But oh, at least at least some of our brothers are in the city and they go on living their life, spending their paycheck, enjoying their freedom, which is really slavery in disguise. That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; They've been made twofold children of hell, &gt;&gt; just enough freedom to keep them from doing all the things they did in sin, &gt;&gt; but not enough freedom to give them victory over those vices and those uh little pet sins and little foxes, and not enough victory to cause them to speak with integrity and truth all the time. In fact, they've learned to to uh you know color things and to shade things in such a way &gt;&gt; that it's really not an entire lie, &gt;&gt; but it's not really truth either. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, there's too many folks in this church &gt;&gt; that live under that kind of a banner. &gt;&gt; I'm being honest. I'm doing my job. &gt;&gt; I'm doing what I'm called to do, and that is show the house to the house. If I don't do that, I'm just here for a meal ticket, &gt;&gt; and you can't afford my taste. I'm not here for a meal ticket. I have to sleep. I love the privilege of of laying in the bed beside my wife, but I'll tell you who I'm really worried about. I have to sleep with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have to know when I go to bed at night that I have delivered my all, &gt;&gt; that I've done my job. &gt;&gt; If I ever come to this pull pit unprepared, God help me. I'm slipping. &gt;&gt; Somebody better help me out. &gt;&gt; Overprepared maybe, but never I don't want to ever be underprepared. And I don't ever want to be so committed to a set of notes that I can't follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit. If that's the case, then we become just like the rest. &gt;&gt; There's a vision over this house. There's a mandate over this house. There's a reason why we're gathered the way we are. Somebody said, "Oh, you just think." Listen, I think every pastor who who believes he's doing God's will ought to ought to be believe somehow that there is something that that body of believers is supposed to do. &gt;&gt; That may not be like every other church in the neighborhood. &gt;&gt; If every church does it just the same, that all we've got is the World Council of Churches. Come on. &gt;&gt; I didn't even want a church. I wasn't looking for a church. This is to be a place of revival. &gt;&gt; It's to be a revival ministry. It's to be a revival center. It's supposed to be a house of deliverance. &gt;&gt; And if you're waiting on somebody to bring deliverance to you, I don't understand that mentality. Because when I realize that I need freedom, I've somehow brought myself back under some bondage that I that I escaped from. I run to God &gt;&gt; and I say, "Papa, please have mercy on me. I've lost the freedom that I once had &gt;&gt; to pray through at all hours of the day and night. We need prayer list. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are we are an ADHD generation. We cannot remember. We go into a room at 30, &gt;&gt; at 25 &gt;&gt; and can't remember why we came in. &gt;&gt; That's the curse that the world has placed on this generation. And you carry the instrument of such &gt;&gt; condition in your pocket &gt;&gt; and I carry it in mine. It's a fact. It's brain science. &gt;&gt; Your attention span. Listen, you can't even hardly answer a question that someone askked of you. &gt;&gt; Don't ask me a question if you don't want to hear an answer. But how many of you realize that people will ask you a question and before you have answered their question, they're they're already looking on. &gt;&gt; It's quiet in here. &gt;&gt; You know it's the truth. &gt;&gt; You know it's the truth. And some don't even hide it. Some will ask you a question while they're checking their email. This is a curse, not a blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hello. &gt;&gt; I believe that I am preaching the truth this morning. I believe that I am telling it right like it is this morning. I believe that there are very few people in this body who spend any time &gt;&gt; come on &gt;&gt; in the scripture unless you count that little text that you get every day from your Bible app that you don't read. &gt;&gt; I may have a half a dozen people send it to me. I read it and then my mind wonders. I wonder if anybody that sent it to me read it because you don't get extra brownie points. That's right &gt;&gt; for sending me a scripture of the day &gt;&gt; if you don't take time to read it for yourself. &gt;&gt; That's all right. I'll help myself preach. &gt;&gt; I want this to be ser Well, it was mighty serious last Sunday. Yeah. And a few people showed up Tuesday night anyway. Let's see if it'll happen again. Somebody said, "We had a nice crowd on Tuesday night." And I said, "Yes, much better than I expected after I had preached so hard on Sunday." It's not what I want to do. I look forward to the day that I don't have to. &gt;&gt; Let that begin now. Is all right with me. But I am under an obligation. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To try at least to awaken you &gt;&gt; to the reality of the precious promises that have been made for this generation and for this last hour bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not about money, &gt;&gt; how much we can make, sir, &gt;&gt; how far ahead in life we can get, &gt;&gt; I want you to know there was a rich man in the Bible who filled up all his barns, built bigger barns. &gt;&gt; And a and while he was still in the process of building his empire, today you fool, &gt;&gt; just just today you fool, your your life is going to be required of you. While you're here just still trying to save it up and build it up, your life is going to be required of you. And in hell, he lifted up his eyes being in torment. &gt;&gt; He got so desperate that he said, "Well, you just send some of my brothers here, somebody to dip their finger in a cool water and touch into my tongue, for I'm tormented in these flames. I'm tormented in this condition." Father Abraham spoke to him in this story that Jesus is telling and said, "It's not permitted. No one can come across that divide. There's a divide there and it can't be crossed. Then would you send my brothers back to the earth that they could preach to others?" And he said, "That would be great. But if they won't believe the prophets, those that are sent to them now, &gt;&gt; do you think they would dare believe those who have raised from the dead to try to tell them the truth?" &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the hour we're in. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, that's the hour we're in. Somebody ought to help me. That's the hour we're in right now. &gt;&gt; These nuts who are waiting on brother Brandham to fly in an airplane and pitch a tent and have a great tent revival and raise up brother Hicks and brother so and so and brother so and so so they can be tent men. All of this nonsense of the Mosley's and all this stuff that has surrounded and cluttered the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; right? They wouldn't believe Brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't believe him if he walked in because the first thing he'd do is tell them how far they have fallen &gt;&gt; from what he gave them in the beginning. &gt;&gt; That's where we are. Maybe your old pastor that you love so much and had so respect so much respect in who's gone on to be with the Lord. If he raised from the dead tonight, walked down the aisle, and told you what to do about your life, you'd scratch your head, take another pill, and wonder if it was real. &gt;&gt; We wouldn't believe him if they raised from the dead to tell us. &gt;&gt; It's what Jesus said, red letter. &gt;&gt; We have a commission. We have a vision. We have an hour. We have only so much time. I wished I knew exactly how many days. I wished I knew exactly how many years. &gt;&gt; And we come to God's house waited down with our little so weighted down we can't hear the preacher. So weighted down we can't raise our hands. so weighted down that our testimony is. I wanted to praise the Lord, but all I could see was so and so praising the Lord, face the back, turn to the wall, do whatever. Blindfold yourself &gt;&gt; for crying out loud. Sister Megan, come in here with a mouth mask on many, many times. You You can put you some blindfolds on. I mean it. Have I lost my mind? &gt;&gt; Ah, maybe whatever we will what we have to do is biblical you put blinders on the horses. &gt;&gt; Maybe we need a little more Amish mentality. Not really. Not really. Not if you don't know what they believe. But maybe we need a little more of that mentality to put us some blinders on so that we'll be less likely to be distracted by somebody else. Let me tell you something. Fall in love with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Get so full of the Holy Ghost. Love him. Catch a half a glimpse of who he is now. Right now. Right now. Right now. He is Jesus Christ. The same. Yes. Right now. He's alive. And well, he's wooing his church. He's calling and somebody's worried about somebody else's. Amen. Where's yours? Where's your praise? Where's your God bless you? Where's your I'm praying for you, pastor. Where's I'm praying for your family. I'm praying for the leadership. I'm praying for this house. Where's that? &gt;&gt; You so quickly will sit around and carry out, talk about, pick out, point out the flaws of this house, the flaws of somebody else's children, the flaws of somebody else's family. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Where's your prayer commitment? Where's your prayer burden? Where is your prayer list? We don't even pay enough attention to the prayer requests that if we're called on to pray that we can get up here and even remember. &gt;&gt; I don't even try. I just bundle them up before the Lord. They don't have to be called out. Somebody said, "Well, it sure makes people feel good if you call them out individually." Why should we worry and take the time to call them out individually so somebody else feels good about their prayer request when they're probably not committing five minutes &gt;&gt; to pray for their own burden? &gt;&gt; That's the hour that's not against you. That's the hour that we're living in. It's everybody else's responsibility to pray it through. It's everybody else's responsibility to bear the burden. &gt;&gt; Let somebody else pick up the trash. &gt;&gt; We have so little regard and I'm talking about the generation of church an annity. But of course we cannot exclude ourselves. We have so much in this hour uh of of some kind of privilege or something that we can break or destroy or damage something that belongs to someone else perhaps even in the church and never even tell anybody &gt;&gt; who can do anything about it. So afraid that we're going to be asked maybe to contribute or to pay for what we broke. will just break it. Do you need a list and never mention to someone? And then if we say something to them about uh you know making sure that when you're up here on this platform that you're that you're careful with this equipment because it was costly. And everybody grabbing a microphone. Do you know what you're holding in your hand? That's not a $30 microphone. &gt;&gt; And there was money by the grace of God to buy it. I don't know if there'll be to replace it. &gt;&gt; But people don't. Nothing is holy or sacred in this generation. We cannot be like the the the world around us. We've got to be a little different. Let me tell you something. Uh even the prophet of the of the past generation talked to us spoke to us about the sacredness of this desk &gt;&gt; and and this place up here. &gt;&gt; A and he said you know it seemed my people would want to get as close to where the fire comes down and touches the angel. &gt;&gt; When said they want to see how close to the back door they can get. &gt;&gt; Some don't even make you past the couch. [Music] because we have come to a place in this late hour that that nothing nothing's very sacred. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you, Nehemiah, he came to a position of great trust. He certainly was grateful for the trust that the king showed in him. He was the cup bearer. He took his position in Persia toward the king as a privilege. And that's why he was chosen for the job. How many of you remember what his job was? He was a cup bearer. Perhaps you think that means that he would run and fetch the dinner wear, the crystal or the glassear for the table. No, that's not what the cup bearer did. The cup bearer guarded the chalice. The cup bearer guarded the chalice of the king. &gt;&gt; He was over the king's wine. He was over the king's goblets, we'll say. And if a bottle of wine from the royal house was opened, the king, sorry I'm screaming, I guess I'm losing my voice. The king didn't get the first sip &gt;&gt; because somebody might have poisoned &gt;&gt; the wine and the king would die and the kingdom crumbled. So a cup bearer, &gt;&gt; oh listen folks, he so loved and cherished the responsibility that had been placed in him in service of the king that he was willing &gt;&gt; to risk his own life. &gt;&gt; Many say it Many say it. It's easy to say, &gt;&gt; "But he was willing to take the cup, to take a big sip." And don't you think the king grabbed it and took the next sip right away? Oh, no. He had to give that stuff time to percolate. &gt;&gt; I got to make sure that this is not some long effect, long lasting. May maybe it'll hit him in 24 hours. Let's just put that bottle away. I'm not quite ready to drink that one yet. Let me see if he lives. Can you imagine being the dummy? Because that's how how it would almost feel. But but Nehemiah, oh no, Nehemiah didn't feel like a flunky. &gt;&gt; Nehemiah was trusted. Let me tell you something. In order to be the king's cup bearer, he had to be trusted. &gt;&gt; That he wouldn't let anything slip by him. &gt;&gt; And he didn't just say, "I'm committed." He was committed because he would take it first. And if he didn't die, then the king would be served the wine. We can't afford for the leader of the kingdom to fall dead because someone has tried to take his life with a little bit of wine. But something happened to Nehemiah. He's just as happy as a as he can be serving the king, cleaning the cup, taking the first sip. loyal, loyal, loyal little fellow he was. until one day a merchant came to Shushan and began to describe to him the horror of the condition of the city that God had called an eternal city, a bridal city, a royal city, the city of David, &gt;&gt; the city of the great king, &gt;&gt; Yerushim, Jerusalem, the golden. He said, "It's terrible. You wouldn't believe it." He said, "I've seen with my own eyes." Nehemiah's hearing this. I've seen with my own eyes the devastation of the great temple in Jerusalem. I've seen the ruin of the walls of the city and the gates broken from the hinges and the wood of the gates burned in the streets of the city. It's been over 130 years and nobody has even gotten to the place that they've removed all the ashes where the gates of the city were burned in their place. And Nehemiah begins to hear this story and his heart, he doesn't know what's wrong with him, but his heart begins to yearn and break and cry for what was, for the glory that was, for the beauty that was before the city had been defiled. He couldn't stand the thought that the city was broken down and that heathens climbed over the walls, climbed over the rocks, the boulders that once made the strong walls, garrisons, and bullwarks of the city. I've walked the bullwarks of Jerusalem myself. The walls of the city now restored. In places, you're walking on the actual stone that was original to the wall. And in other places where there is no longer a walk from stone, there is steel and metal walkways that have been added to the inside of the walls of Jerusalem. And you can literally almost walk all the way around. There's a couple places where you have to come down, but you can almost walk around the the whole entire city. You stand up in that beautiful place and look over and see Golgata and you see where the Garden Tomb is. You can see if you're interested in seeing the Rockefeller Museum is there and and and you see all the beautiful places of the valley Henome and and go around to the to the Mount of Olives and you see all the graves of the righteous Zedox that have died in the faith of the God of Israel. You can look over to the cemetery in in Zion just below Mount Zion and know that uh that Oscar Schindler is buried there saving so many Jews. This everywhere you look is history and beauty. And it's a wonderful thing that it's restored. But it is restored today because of vision and burden and passion and and vision of somebody like a Nehemiah who said, "I like my job, &gt;&gt; but my heart is breaking. I find myself groaning &gt;&gt; for the condition of the holy city. I've got to go. I've got to do something. I I I can't let it go on like this. He was one of the most selfish servants in the kingdom. He risked his life every day for the king of Persia. He was chosen not only by the king but by God to put his life on the line. He served the king with no reservation. He served the king not holding anything back. He was totally completely loyal to the king to the extent that he was willing to drink the wine first to see whether or not it was poison. But when he heard of the devastation of the city of Jerusalem, it broke him like he had never been broken in his life because he knew that there were promises that were attached to those stones. Don't take a pregnant woman to look at those stones because I did and it doesn't have the same effect. Don't take a pregnant woman to the tomb of Samson because you're going to jostle her around getting her there. And if she's pregnant, she's got bigger things on her mind and she's not as interested as you are. She doesn't jump out of the van at every stop. Sometimes Sister Nancy wouldn't even stop the van. She'd just slow it down. I'd jump out, run ahead of everybody else. Let me touch the stones. Let me let me sit where uh sages have sat. Let me lay down where prophets have laid down. Let let me walk these cobblestones that my Lord walked up coming out of Golgatha, the garden of Gethsemane on the way up. It's it's there's no way to describe what it's like. And I had no real attachment, no previous memory, but Nehemiah did. It was the city of promise. He knew that God had said that I have chosen the hill of Zion as a capital for my people. The Jebusite fortress. Oh, taken by David and his men to build a palace to call it Jerusalem. 3,000year old city recognized for 3,000 years as Jerusalem. This was way back when Nehemiah knew that God said it's an eternal city. to hear that it was broken down. He knew that the temple was built on Mount Moria where Abraham was called to offer Isaac as a sacrifice. And he heard that that was now polluted, temple destroyed, stone still laying 130 years later in the ashes of its destruction. Her her bullwarks broken down, her walls cannot be compassed. and no watchmen standing on the towers because the towers have crumbled. There's no one guarding the city. And I I I've got to do something. I I have to do something. The city is laying in shambles. His countenance was cast down, the Bible said. And he couldn't shake the sadness. How long has it been? Look this way. How long has it been since you've cared about anything that much? It's a question. It's not a condemnation. It's not a judgment. It's a question. How long has it been? How long has it been since you cared about the spiritual war welfare of your children and grandchildren? As much as Nehemiah. Oh, you're there perhaps to correct them. You're there to talk about them. You're there. But how long has it been since you have been swallowed by a b a burden of compassion and and passion? And you've laid before the Lord, calling their name to God, asking God to bring them back to where they once stood in his house, in his presence. Come on now. &gt;&gt; You You don't mind asking everybody else? &gt;&gt; Pray for them. Pray for them. Pray for them. Pray for them. How long has it been since you missed a breakfast? How long has it been since you missed a lunch? How long has it been since you missed a supper &gt;&gt; because you were so consumed? There's children in this church that have Godgiven gifts. &gt;&gt; They're not old enough to operate in those gifts uh uh like we like we hope one day. Some of you have been told directly, prophetically, directly that that God has placed in these children gifts to help guard and protect his bride. How long has it been since you worried stowed? I don't mean worried in the sense that you you you just don't see how it's going to be. I mean you cared enough that you bent your knee. How long has it been since your children come rushing in the house and saw daddy &gt;&gt; on his knees &gt;&gt; at the sofa? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not playing some stupid game &gt;&gt; that's going to perish. &gt;&gt; It's going to perish. Somebody's going to beat your score. Ha. Somebody's going to beat your score. Listen, folks. in this generation we're living in now will go so far that they'll connect their their device with somebody else's device on the other side of the world or other side of the nation, somebody they don't even know. Strike up relationships and friendships with people they have no idea what they look like or what they do. Perhaps you'll be like a a girl who uh who left the church years ago with her husband, but yet determined to keep her marriage. The next thing you know, she has met someone on the other side of the world, playing games, packs her little bag, leaves her family to go and see if this is my next potential relationship. Finds out he's an old creep. by the grace of God able to escape and get back to the airport and come home. If you think that was an isolated case from from 15 years ago, there's craziness like that that goes on right now. And some of it closer than you think. closer than you think. We don't know where our children are when they're children. We don't know where they are when they're teenagers. We don't know where they are when they're young adults. If one of my children would have come to me and said, "I don't want you to monitor my whereabouts anymore. or I think I'm of age and I don't need anybody watching out and knowing where I am. I would have said tough toenails. I bought it. I pay the bill. &gt;&gt; Don't matter whether you bought it or whether you pay the bill. Doesn't matter. I'm responsible. When I hear the story, the horror stories of that poor girl murdered on on a jogging trail by an illegal immigrant. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; An alien murdered her. And there was a glitch in the cell service that day and there was a period of time where no one could locate where she was. Not because she thought she was misindependent, but because there was actually a glitch in the system and they couldn't call her, couldn't reach her, couldn't get a hold of her, couldn't find her on that thing. And perhaps God is sovereign, but perhaps if they would have been able to see where she was, somebody might would have been able to help her to beat the hoodlm off with a rock, a big one. But instead he brutally it's sometimes it's for your own protection. One of mine come told me uh uh I I'm not you're not going to monitor me anymore. Let me tell you something. I would explain to them that's not the way life works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just not the way life works. But we get to a place where we want them oh you know they can just they've got to express who they are. They've got to, you know, they've got to let it out. They've got to be able to show their emotions and, you know, no restriction and a and every time they whimper, we've got to run them out the door and and we've got to bring the toy box to church with us. Preach &gt;&gt; to make sure that they're all entertained well enough. Let me tell you something. If we would be that diligent &gt;&gt; over their spiritual welfare, This is a serious hour. &gt;&gt; I pray God gives me something happier to preach soon. Nehemiah is so weary that he can't hide it. And he goes in with the king's cup one day and the king says, "Nehemiah, what's wrong with it? Your face, your You're always so happy. You greet the world with a smile. Why are you so sad? The reality is that Nehemiah could have been struck down by speaking to the pagan king about the welfare of the holy city of Jerusalem, which represented a kingdom that could eventually rise and take his. But Nehemiah said, "Oh, I've heard of the ruin and the destruction of Jerusalem, and I can hardly I can hardly stand it." A a and I'd like to do something about it. And guess what? The king allows him. Oh my goodness. The king allows him. Let me hurry. It's 120. I've got to hurry. So here Nehemiah when in the scripture that we read initially he's accused of self-exaltation plotting rebellion false prophecy though all he was doing was following a burden a vision on his heart Nehemiah rebuilt Jerusalem's wall as Nehemiah eventually began to rebuild Jerusalem's walls he was still being accused of self-promotion he wants to be the king remember how we read it he's gathering prophets to back him and they're prophesying that he is to be the son who will be king of Judah. All of that lies. &gt;&gt; All of it lies. &gt;&gt; Just misunderstanding. That's where Nehemiah was. He was fermenting in the vessel of misunderstanding. While they lied about his intentions, while they lied about his purpose, while they even lied about the spiritual nature of why he was doing what he was doing, Nehemiah wasn't trying to be king. He was simply trying to do God's work. But people were constantly twisting his motives and attacking his integrity, his character, publicly maligned. And in verse eight, then I sent unto him, saying, look at it. Nehemiah 6:8, there are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou fainst them out of thine own heart. In the amplified, it reads, I replied to him, no such things as you say have been done. You are inventing them out of your own heart and mind. It doesn't have to be true. Stay with me &gt;&gt; for somebody to tell it. They told all across the Carolas that standing up there behind brother Shelly is a is a scroll dedicated to a woman preacher. They failed to mention that it was my grandmother. They failed to mention that she that we are continuing a church that she built and paid for with her own money. Whether you like it or not, we have benefited and we I mean we've we paid this mortgage off. I understand that. But we wouldn't have been here in the first place. &gt;&gt; We wouldn't be in the building we're in right now had we not been able to sell the building that she left &gt;&gt; free and clear. I'm not edifying her years of preaching. When when I bought when I got that scroll from Jerusalem and when Sister Nancy helped have that inscription made, it wasn't to memorialize her as a woman preacher. It was to memorialize her as my spiritual roots. &gt;&gt; And there's someone who loved the word. So put that in your pipe and smoke it. &gt;&gt; But they tell that all over the world &gt;&gt; like that. I I want to say to them like Nehemiah, no such thing &gt;&gt; as you say have even been done. &gt;&gt; When I pastored in South Carolina, we prayed over rocks. We did. I got some in here. And we put them places where we needed some breakthrough under the bed of an old sorry, bitter, mean, ugly backslider who was mistreating his family. I prayed over that rock and I said, "Father, give him nightmares. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let him wake up like the drunk man in brother Sheffy's movie &gt;&gt; and find himself in a bathtub of fire &gt;&gt; until he run." That's how that's how crazy and radical we were in those days. &gt;&gt; And God did it. My mother decided she was going to serve the Lord further. She wanted to come to South Carolina to do it. The bank told her, "We don't have a job available. There's no way in the world you'll ever get a transfer to South Carolina." I said, "Mother," she was up to visit. Take this anointed rock and go lay it uh down at the head main office in Columbus. Lay it up there where the manager, the big big wig down there, when she gets out of her car, let that rock be laying right by her car every day. And when God gets through her, it was just a point of contact. That's all. It's not a doctrine. &gt;&gt; You don't have to tell the whole world. &gt;&gt; Just a point of contact. May May the voice of God cry out to her. May May she find herself in a tither &gt;&gt; until she says, "Jane, I I'm going to make a I'm going to make a place." It wasn't But listen, it wasn't weeks. It was a very short amount of time. They called from Anderson, South Carolina, and said, "We understand that there's a lady down there who wants to make a transfer. We don't even know how they knew there at the bank, but and we'd like to have her. &gt;&gt; We've looked at her. We see she's been a teller for years. We need a teller manager. We'd like to have her." &gt;&gt; Mama said, "Should I bring the rock?" I said, "No, leave it there. We want them saved now. Now, we're going to work on their salvation." And you know what they told after I came to the message? They told all over the city that if you go over there on a prayer meeting night, they get on the floor, all fours, put rocks on their back and crawl all over the church praying in the in the name of a dead man. Somebody said, "Where did they get a story?" Don't you understand? Nehemiah knew where it came from. People will, especially when you're in a vessel, vessel of misunderstanding, people will invent out of their imagination, &gt;&gt; out of their own emotion, out of their own prejudices, &gt;&gt; out of their own jealousies. They will make up something as elaborate as crawling around the church on prayer meeting night with a pile of rocks on your back praying in the in the name of a dead man. Nothing of any Well, there was nothing even similar. We were just shaking backsliders out of their beds. Same way we put prayer claws. She ought to have tried. We had faith. We believed that if a point of contact got in their space &gt;&gt; that God would deal with her heart. It worked. Nehemiah just look, I just want to see the walls repaired. I don't care who the king is. I don't care who gets the glory. &gt;&gt; You've never done anything for God. Listen, you've never done anything for God until you've done it. And you absolutely don't care &gt;&gt; who. You will sit in the room and watch somebody else receive the credit and the praise and the brag for what you have done. And you'll smile and nod your head and agree with them. Yes. That's right. Oh, that's so nice. Oh my goodness. Wasn't that a wonderful thing our brother did? Yes. and you will nod your head. Somebody said, "Would you do it?" I have. I have had evangelists come here and preach messages and say things that I have been saying, exact sentences, exact points that I have been preaching for 30 years. While they were still in sin serving the devil, I was preaching &gt;&gt; what you bragged them up for saying. And the reality is some of them got it from me anyhow &gt;&gt; and came here and preached it anyway. And I didn't care. &gt;&gt; Well, why are you mentioning it? Because I'm telling you, it don't matter. When you care, when you see people responding, when you see people listening to a preacher that won't listen to you anymore, &gt;&gt; when you see people moving that don't usually move, your heart, if you're a watchman, your heart gets so moved. that you just say, "Oh, God." Don't matter who you use. &gt;&gt; We're the ones who get so picky over who God use. Whoever use Roosters, roosters. &gt;&gt; Jackasses. &gt;&gt; You You know he's desperate when he starts cussing. No. No. Oh, it looks like you've taken a hard fold. No, unless you consider the fact that I'm cussing in the pull pit. God will use whatever. And if you've got a burden and God uses a whatever to help see something in that situation move, you'll praise God. You'll praise God for a whatever. Time is quickly slipping. Not this morning. &gt;&gt; But time is quickly slipping away from us. You You're just emotional because you're getting older. The reality is I know I I don't have another 50 years of ministry. I've asked myself every day this week just about closer. Have we come any higher? Have we found any measure of deliverance that's greater than we had when we started out? Are we any closer? H Have we made any progress? Have we in all of our wanderings in the wilderness? Ha have we do we have any more of home in our heart? Do we do we have any more fight left in us? Do do we do we uh just coast now or or is there a possibility that we will catch one more real wind and push pray until something happens. &gt;&gt; It's not your emotion that I'm asking for. Because emotion can be just as religious as anything else. &gt;&gt; I'm asking for determination that will last beyond a sermon. I'm asking for determination that will wake you up Monday morning. Yes. &gt;&gt; A determination that is not about proving to others who you are &gt;&gt; or what you've done or how sorry you are or whether your repentance is real or not. But a determination that says if they never forgive me, if they never change their minds about me, &gt;&gt; if they never invite me to their party, &gt;&gt; come on, &gt;&gt; if they never include me for swimming, &gt;&gt; I'm going to serve God more than I've ever served him before. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read the word and ask God to make it real in me like I never have before. &gt;&gt; I'm going to support the meeting. I'm going to be faithful. I'm going to pray for my pastor. I'm going to pray for my family. I'm going to find a place by the couch &gt;&gt; on occasion. I'm not trying to make you feel terrible. What if I were to go around this room and and speak to your teenager and ask them, "How long has it been since you've heard mama in her bedroom praying?" How long has it been since you walked in on dad? Pray. How long has it been since you since you What if I asked these smart I say smart elic but um smart children we have they're also products of their of their generation they're some of them are products of immunization some of them are products of this generation products of screens smarter than they know what to do with the attention span of a bumblebee. So used to getting everything in tiny little pieces, not just as little all the way up, just little bite-sized pieces of life. What if I were to ask them, "These are teenagers here and some older." What if I were to go to somebody like Callie's age? Or or uh Nora, how old are you? Seven. That's old enough. I was preaching at seven. Who's 17 here? I was pastoring at 17. So, that'll give you a little perspective. Nora, come. Come up here. Let everybody see how tall you are at seven. Maybe I was a little taller. Turn around. Let everybody see you. Maybe I was a little taller. Of course, I didn't go barefoot in church, so I might have had, you know, Thank you, sweetheart. Go sit down. You're beautiful. Who is 17? Jaden, was that you? Stand up. You're not beautiful, but stand up. Turn around here and see. Sit down. I was never that skinny, but I was 17 at one time, pastoring a denominational church, preaching my first sermon, not much taller than Nora. I know a little bit about what I'm talking about. What if we were to go around this room? What if I were to ask Nora? What? What? How old is Millie? Millia. Nine. So, anybody in that age group, what if I were to go around and ask them, "How long has it been since you've walked in the room and daddy was sitting in the chair after work with a Bible in his lap? How long has it been since the sound of Brother Brandham's voice was heard in the kitchen? You think I'm mad? I'm not mad. If I was mad, I'd have indigestion. I don't have any indigestion. How long has it been? Is that because we're so far along now that we don't need those kind of things? We don't need We don't need a daddy with a Bible. Someone recently told me, "I don't even have a Bible because I have my phone." You need a Bible. You're going to beat the devil with a phone. Papa works. He had a He had a Bible. I know it's not the word on the page. It's the word in you that's going to defeat the enemy. I am just making a point that we have gotten really out of cater here. What if I were to go around and ask what goes on in your home? Is it ever mentioned? Is there ever a prayer offered on Saturday night for a good service on Sunday morning? I'm only trying to point out that the zeal that we have had, many of us no longer have. And there's never been a more critical hour to have a zeal for the house of God, for the things of God, than now. Now is the time. Now is the moment. and and and Nehemiah, as long as he didn't really know, he knew what had happened, but as long as he didn't have a a picture of what had happened in Jerusale, he could go on and serve the king. But once he caught an image &gt;&gt; through the description of the merchant, he said, "I just can no longer function, sir. I just can't stand the fact." He didn't know he was fixing to be fermenting in the vessel of misunderstanding. Nehemiah 1:3 and4 I'm closing. I I don't know why. I mean I What good does it do to preach a third of a sermon? I don't have 50 more years to preach. You don't have 50 more years to listen. We're in the last generation. You think it's o those of us who are over 50. I I No. Eternity is closer than it's ever been. You maybe you'll be like those who won't believe it until it's upon them. But I'm telling you, you'll look back one day and see, oh my, we didn't realize where things were going and how quickly they were going there. Nehemiah 1 3 and 4. And they said unto me, the remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire. And it came to pass when I heard these words that I sat down and wept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven. Nehemiah's immediate response was fasting and prayer and seeking God to take some intervention to do something about this awful condition of the broken down walls of the city of Jerusalem. In verse 5, he said, ' And I said, I beseech thee, oh Lord, a God of heaven, the great and terrible God that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments. Let thine ear now be attentive and thine eyes open that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant which I pray before thee now day and night for the children of Israel, thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee. Both I and my father's house have sinned. We have dealt corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments which thou commandest thy servant Moses. Remember, I beseech thee the word that thou commandest thy servant Moses, saying, If you transgress, I will scatter you abroad. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're living in the reality of what the prophet warned them about. Yes. &gt;&gt; For if you turn But if you turn unto me and keep my commandments, and do them, though there were of you cast out into the uttermost parts of the heaven, yet will I gather thee from then, bring thee under the place that I have chosen to set my name thereof. Nehemiah's praying, God, I remember you made some promises over the Jewish people. You made some promises to Abraham, that your seed would his seed would be as numerous as the sands of the seashore and the stars of the heaven. I remember that you said that Jerusalem was a covenant bridal city. I remember you said Messiah would sit in that city one day and judge the nations. How is it possible when the walls are torn down? The gates are burned and there's no one doing anything about it. Let thine ear now be attentive to the prayer of thy servant. Verse 11. And to the prayers of thy servants who desire to fear thy name and prosper. I pray thee thy servant this day and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. for I was the king's cup bearer. He had boldness. God gave him divine favor. And in in Nehemiah 24-8, he got some permission to do something about it. Let me read it quickly. You see how I can read it fast? Can you hear it fast? Can you understand it fast? Then the king said unto me, "For what dost thou request?" So I prayed to the God of heaven, and I said unto the king, if it pleased the king, and if thy servant found favor in thy sight, that thou would send me unto Judah, unto the city of my father's separates, that I may build it. And the king said unto me, the queen also sitting by him. For how long shalt thy journey be, and when will thou return? For so it pleased the king to send me for a set time, and I set him a time. Moreover, I said unto the king, if it pleased the king, his letters be given to me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah. He knew the journey wouldn't be easy. And a letter unto Asaf, the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace. You bold little cupbearer, you &gt;&gt; not only are you asking for a royal decree from the king, you're asking for letters of permission to pass through enemy territory. And now you're asking for royal beams to be given to you from the king's forest to build and restore the gates and the house of worship for the Jews that we conquered. &gt;&gt; Oh God, make us Nehemiah's. Make beams for the gates of the palace which have pertained to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me according to the good hand of my God upon me. It was divine favor on his life. Nehemiah uh uh 2:9. Then I came to the governors beyond the river and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me. And then Nehemiah 21:17 18. Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in. how Jerusalem lith waste, the gates are of a burn with fire. Come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no more a reproach. Then I told them with the hand of my God which was good upon me and also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And listen to what they said, let us get mad at the preacher. Oh no, no. Let us rise up and build. &gt;&gt; So they strengthen their hands. for this good work. With official authority and military escort, Nehemiah begins his journey from Persia to the devastated city of Jerusalem. Nehemiah Nehemiah led the charge of the rebuilding of the walls amidst fierce opposition. Enemies like San Ballad, Tobaya, and Gisham attempt to stop the work with mockery, ridicule, and intimidation. Oh, you're building the walls, are you? You and that rag tag bunch of hooknosed Jews. They were enemies of God. Oh, you you you're you don't even know what you're doing. If a fox should run up against it, he knocked the whole wall down. There's always going to be somebody saying something. &gt;&gt; I heard you. I heard you, Tiffany. Something about you. When you start out to make a change in your life, when you start reordering your priorities, &gt;&gt; every time somebody you love will call you religious, somebody you love without you ever trying to push things on them. Here's the problem that we make when we catch a new zeal. We want to force it. &gt;&gt; That's legalistic phariseism. &gt;&gt; It won't work. You've got to build an atmosphere with the changes you make in your life that'll make them so hungry, &gt;&gt; so spiritually jealous of what God's doing in you and for you that they'll start wanting to pay the price you're paying. &gt;&gt; But instead, we want to go talking to them about their ham sandwich. &gt;&gt; You think that's what the bride ought to be worried about now &gt;&gt; in this late hour? You think that we ought to be worried about whether somebody has lit a candle for Shabbat? &gt;&gt; You think that is how we're going to bring our families into total surrender &gt;&gt; for this? No. &gt;&gt; You're trading one religious practice for another religious practice. It'll never work and it will never satisfy you &gt;&gt; for very long because you were born for more. You were listen you were born for more than a tradition. You were born for more than than a regulation. &gt;&gt; You were born to become the manifestation of the word. &gt;&gt; The revelation these things won't satisfy for long. The reason why I thank God for the standard that we have been able to maintain is because it has given us the single benefit of not having to deal with some of the things that other churches around this message have had to deal with in forms of compromise. But we've got it. We've got it, too. When teenagers from this body can go in public with short britches on, we've got compromise in this body, too. There's certain things for home. You sleep in certain something certain whatever. It's your business. That's not the way we want to run to town. &gt;&gt; You ladies be careful. You get around them and they they've got on now in the churches so much makeup. I'm not talking about Pentecostal churches. They've been having it for 40 years that way. Talking about churches that know better. It's very, very sad. But we've maintained enough of the standard here that we have kept some of that beat back. And I tell you what, I'm fixing to rise up and beat some more of it back. This is a serious hour we're living in. And it is not about rules and regulations and restrictions. It's about a heart sold out to God. &gt;&gt; But if you let the walls fall down &gt;&gt; and you don't do anything to restore them, then the people will cast off. And the benefit the the the horrible ending of casting off restraint is perish. San Ballad, Horonite, Tobaya the servant, the Ammonite, Gisham the Arabian, Nehemiah 21:19 heard it. They laughed us to scorn and despised us and said, "What is this thing that you do? Will you rebel against the king?" Rebel against the king. We're trying to build the walls back. We're trying to restore the heritage of the we we we're no challenge to the king. It's always politics, isn't it? Nehemiah 4:1. But it came to pass that when Sam Balot heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth. He took great indignation and mocked the Jews. He spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria and said, "What do these feeble Jews? Will they fortify themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they make an end in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?" Now Tobiia the Amorite Ammonite was by him and he said even that which they build if a fox go up he'll break it down. So sad there was such internal strife among the Jews themselves because in the midst of the restoration they start uh going back and choosing wives from pagan nations. We always want to make it about color or race. In the Bible, it wasn't about shades of skin. It was about coming from pagan religions and nations who did not acknowledge the real true genuine God. God said, "Don't take wives from them." Not particularly because because we forget that these Jews were not Ashkanazis coming out of Egypt, pale European Jews. They were Middle Eastern Jews of Arab descent, darker skinned, thicker, darker skinned people. We make it we we find some little something and we and we make it about uh uh you know how Lord have mercy what would they do in South Africa when there's a hundred different shades of skin because of the mixing of the uh of the English, the Dutch, the British, the the and the Zulus. And they've got black, white, and colored. And colored covers a multitude of of skin tones. And is somebody supposed to go and put their arm up next to somebody's arm and make sure the the skin tone matches before they're not about that. You don't I don't need your amen. It's not about that. We make it about that &gt;&gt; because we're still bearing the curse of such wicked racism in this nation. &gt;&gt; But it's about joining uh you know mar unequally yolked together here. You're sacrificing to God Almighty with your life of modesty and holiness and you go and marry somebody. Never mind. &gt;&gt; We don't have to say it. You certainly know it didn't work. It didn't work for Ahab and she was of the same color. There was such internal strife among the Jews because they were taking these heathen wives after God had already told them not to do it and they had repented of doing it. And now in the midst of the restoration, they start doing it again and he has to lay it out. Go read it for yourself. Nehemiah 5, I'll spare you the first 13 verses of that chapter, but go home. Go read it. So, not only do I have to deal with a San Ballot and a Tobias and all these other heathens who mock everything we try to do to restore the walls, now I there's dissension in the ranks and we can't even get together on who to marry and he carries 13 verses to try to sort that out. Nehemiah, however, remains resolute trusting in the God of heaven to bring success. He responded with strategic planning, prayer, and vigilance, and firm correction of injustice within the community. And I want to read these verses and close. And I haven't preached this message. I meddled. Anointed meddling. You needed it. I needed it. We needed it. Nehemiah, no apologies. You may leave with indigestion. I'm not not leaving here with any heartburn. I'm leaving here with the appetite. And it came to pass from that time forth in Nehemiah 4:16 that the half of my servants wrought. You said you want you said you wanted a house of deliverance. You said you wanted a pastor who would bring correction. You said you wanted somebody who saw would see in the spirit and tell us what we needed in this hour. Now don't you draw back your hand now. Come on. &gt;&gt; That's the reason I ask you why are you here? &gt;&gt; If you were here for a for a 45minute denominational sermonet, you knew when you walked in here that was not likely what you were going to have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You weren't fooled into coming this morning. &gt;&gt; Don't you know I face every day the reality that if we would cut these services down and and and short we would we could have more. There are people who love us, who love a little bit of the truth that I preach and could could certainly come and sit. We know people have said they would have moved here if the services hadn't have been so long. But I don't know if I'm willing just yet at the at 57. I don't know if I'm willing &gt;&gt; when time is getting so short. Even though I know that I haven't had some of you in an hour, but it's recorded. This is serious. This chapter here, let me I I can't read it all, but but I'm going to get 16-23. And it came to pass chapter 4 that from that time forth that the half of my servants wrought the work and the other half of them held both spears and shields and bows and harbishons and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah. They which build it on the wall, and they that bear burdens, with those that laid it to everyone, with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand he held a weapon. Hammer in one hand, sword in another. What a divided task. can't continue to build with full effort because you have to spend so much time beating the enemy back. Hello. &gt;&gt; So, you just have to divide the task. I'm building with one hand and cutting back the enemy. &gt;&gt; We must. That's what happened here. For the builders, everyone had his sword girded by his side and so build it. Now listen. They which build it on the wall, and they that bear burdens, with those that laid it, everyone with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon. For if, for the builders everyone had his sword girded by his side, and so build it. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me. And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, the work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another. In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us, our God shall fight for us. Nearly 30 years ago, there was a call that went out of this place with those very words. We are separated on the wall. We are not making the progress we need to make because we're so far separated on the wall. In whatsoever place you hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither. For our God shall fight for us. And some heard that call and changed their lives. the trajectory of their life changed forever because they recognized the blessing and the benefit of being together in community when you're when you're building with one hand and slaying enemies with the other. Somehow we have forgotten how to do things like that. Build and fight. Build and fight. Build and fight. You can't stop building to fight. You can't stop fighting to build. So what do you do? You build and fight. We fight in prayer. We slay enemies in prayer. We slay enemies in praise. We slay enemies by pressing into Christ. &gt;&gt; We defeat the enemy. We defeat the naysayer by doing what they say we cannot because we depend on the Lord and not our own strength and power. &gt;&gt; Huh? So we labored in the work and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared. Enough enough workers came. They said, "Okay, we'll we can divide this up now. Half will build, half will fight." He said, "So neither I said, let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us and labor on the day." Wasn't much time for sleep. Built all day, watched all night. So neither I nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one of them put them off for washing. Thank God on occasion they washed their clothes. No need for night clothes, no need for PJs because they didn't need them anymore. They watched or worked. They worked or watched. And you know what it says in Nehemiah 6:15? So the wall was finished in 52 days. What took hundreds of years? Yes. Because somebody was always tearing part of it down. Now all in shambles and we restored it in 52 days. Why? Why do you think that is? It's real easy. The people had a mind to work. The people had a mind to work. And what's the first thing they did? I'm closing. What's the first thing they did? They called a a holy uh convocation, a consecration in in Nehemiah 8. What are you talking about? The vessel of misunderstanding. Here was a man accused of having ambition. He didn't have ambition. He had a burden. &gt;&gt; He had a passion. &gt;&gt; One that he couldn't get rid of. One that he couldn't sleep off. One that he couldn't take enough pills to forget. &gt;&gt; One who said we can't wait. We can't have vacation. We got to build in the day and watch in the night. &gt;&gt; What it took him years and years and years to do. We don't have that much time. The enemy is getting too comfortable in our ruins. &gt;&gt; He's about to sweep the city clean and raise up a fortress of some false pagan heathen king and god. If we don't take this back for the god of all eternity, it'll soon be lost to all all of us. We've got to get it done. And so he partnered Nehemiah after all this was restored, he partnered with Ezra the scribe in reading the law publicly. This is beautiful. Read it. Nehemiah 8:1-3. Um I won't read it all, but let me go to verse three. And he read therein before the street that was before the Watergate from the morning until midday before the men and the women and those that could understand. And the ears of all the people were attentive under the book of the law. Oh my. If we could get back to that place where the ears of all the people were attentive under the book of the law, &gt;&gt; if we could somehow rewire our brains to have an attention span longer than 30 seconds &gt;&gt; so that we could care. And what we miss, if we had a burden, if we believed, if our lives were hanging on those words, if we truly believed that they were lifechanging and from the father, if we missed some of it, we would hear it again. because we wouldn't want to miss it. The the ears of all the people were attentive under the book of the law. Verse six, and Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God, and all the people answered, "Amen." Amen. With lifting up their hands, and they bowed their heads and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground as the law of God was re-established in the restored city walls of Jerusalem. And then he begins to speak to them about the commandments in chapter 10. And in in chapter 13, he said that we need a rest now. Now we need a rest now. We need to remember the Sabbath. Now we've worked ourselves to the ground. Now we need to go back and remember that God instituted a time of rest and we need to take that because the hour has been hard and the and it's taken a toll on our minds and our bodies. And uh let me remind you that God never gave a Sabbath rest to make people slaves to a Sabbath. He gave rest to refresh and to renew the body &gt;&gt; so that you could go forward and dedicate and consecrate with a new zeal and and health. We're not even healthy enough to win this thing. If it was a physical if if if it was a physical requirement, very few of us, somebody said, "Well, I'm not overweight. It's not all just about the scale. It's about spaghetti noodles for arms and legs. It's about endurance." Nehemiah stands out in scripture as a model of godly leadership, action, and prayer. A reformer who feared God more than man. One who was determined. I don't care if the people misunderstand. I don't care if they don't get it. I don't care if they print about it. I don't care if I get an email this morning. I get them from this guy all the time. I told you about the book that was just recently written about me by the chief apostle in the message from somewhere. A whole book. I thought those days were over that I made any any any ripples big enough to write books about. And then I get an email today. At least this guy calls me Mr. Shelly. He's undressing all the other men that he can think of by name. I'm going to have to call names. And this it goes out all preachers, a lot of lot of places. And he said, "Then you've got Mr. Shelly who wants to take us all back to Pentecost." Listen, I do. But not a denomination, &gt;&gt; not a feeling, not a goosebump, not a jump, not a shout, not a holler, but I want to take us back to the fire that once burned out the sin. the fire that once consecrated and dedicated us in such a way that we could win the battle of the mind because the fire of God burned within our hearts. &gt;&gt; And if in the process of that we get a little joy, I like joy. Don't you? &gt;&gt; And if if after we get what we need on the inside, if a little feeling comes along with it, &gt;&gt; I'm all right with that, too. &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; Because if it's got any life to it, it's going to have a little feeling to it somewhere. But you just can't fight the enemy with a feeling. &gt;&gt; Isn't God good? &gt;&gt; Musicians are coming. Today, Sister Rhonda Shaw's birthday. Tell her happy birthday. [Applause] Tuesday is brother Greg May's Gregory May's birthday and we send birthday greetings to him. It's also sister Tana Waller uh in in uh on the west coast out in in is it Oregon? In Oregon. And uh it would have been brother and sister Williams's wedding anniversary. This coming Tuesday, July 29th. Thursday, July 31st is the Hollowell anniversary. So we say happy anniversary to them. And and maybe somebody would just wouldn't care if we just skip right over Friday. But Friday, August the 1st is the birthday of our sister Joyce Greley. So we want to make sure that we wish her a very happy birthday. And Saturday is sure we have we have plenty of time now. We do. We could just have a a great time here now. The the work's done. The burden's off for a few minutes. Uh Saturday is brother Shane Minko's birthday. Happy birthday to him. and we'll get a chance to tell him. And if our precious deacon would have been alive, if Brother West was still with us, it would have been his 89th birthday this coming Saturday. The season of the Dire Straits doesn't end until August the 3. And we have fellowship meeting Saturday, August the 2nd, 6 o'clock. Sunday, August the 2nd, the 3rd, excuse me, at 11:00 a.m. This Saturday night, this Sunday morning, we have a fellowship meeting. We know that there are a few people coming from different places. More than anything else, we want the Holy Spirit to come &gt;&gt; and have his way. Can we stand together? King Jesus, we love you, Lord. Maybe you could just give them an idea of what you're going to sing, son. And and uh they could just start playing it soft before we begin to worship the Lord. Sister Ginger has asked that if there was time, like I said, we got plenty of time now, we would would pray for her and for Olivia as they make their way to Iceland. before our meetings this weekend that God would uh give them a special time and uh Olivia's getting a chance of a lifetime. A lot of jealous folks because Iceland is beautiful. But she's got some pretty amazing friends here and I'm pretty amazing and she's going to miss us. So, we're going to pray that the Lord will give her great grace, lots of fun and that she'll come home appreciating her friends more than ever before. And if I understand correctly, Brother Magnus will come back with them and it'll be camp meeting time before we see them nearly. So we want to we want to do that before we go. Lord Jesus, you're God's sovereign and God supreme. And we love you dearly, Lord. All we desire is to do, to be, all that you call us, all that you've purposed for us. We fail. We fail daily. But we don't leave this place in condemnation because we know, Lord, that your grace is sufficient for every one of our shortcomings. But we do reach up to receive the call of correction and inspiration. And we say, "Lord, help us to climb up a little higher, to take your word a little more serious than before. Set an example even in our own homes. That your word is hallowed, sanctified, and sacred. And that what we say and do matters." Oh God, may we draw our children, our grandchildren up under us in this hour and lead by example. So vitally important that they, especially as some of us get older, it's vitally important that they take the baton and that they raise up in this hour and get ready for what you're going to do in the closing hours of time and all the ways that we have let them down. Forgive us. have mercy on us. Give us another opportunity to raise up the banner. Lift high the standard of your word. &gt;&gt; May we remember that to be separate It's just as important what we have been separated unto as what we have been separated from. You have called us from the world, from confusion, from legalistic phariseism, but you have called us, sanctified us unto the life of Jesus Christ. May that life pulsate in our inner man until even the outward failing body is quickened &gt;&gt; by the life within and healing and restoration of divine health begins to set up in us. Forgive us for our mourning and our moaning. And may we not try to get out from under the commission or the call. May we just pray for grace and strength to finish the job. It's easy to check out. It would be easy to say, "Come get us, Lord." But we desire to stay and help this younger generation to finish, &gt;&gt; to finish well, to finish holy. so that we might rule and reign judge and sit with you in your throne even as you have sat down with your father in his throne. Thank you for calling us to be overcomers. &gt;&gt; And part of our highest commission is true praise and worship. You alone are worthy, Jesus. You are not a god [Music] by human hands. You are not a god dependent on any mortal man. You are not a god in need of anything we can give by your plan. That's just the way it is. [Music] You are not a god created by human. You are not a god depending on any mortal man. You are not a god in need of anything we can give by your plan. That's just the way it is. You are God alone from before time began. Oh, you are on your throne and you are God alone. And right now in the good times in bad. Oh, you are on your throne. You are God alone. Oh, you are God alone from before time be. Oh, you are on your throne. Yes, you are God alone. And right now, oh, in the good times and bad, you are on your throne. Yes, you are God alone. And you're the only God whose power none can contain. And you're the only God whose name. Praise will never end. You're the only God who's worthy of everything we can give. God, and that's just the way it is. You are God alone. Time begin. You are on your throne. You are God alone. And right now, oh the good times tonight, God, you are on your throne. Yes, you are God. Oh. Oh, you are God alone from before time began. Oh, you are on your throne. Yes, you are God alone. Oh, and right now, oh, in the good times and bad, you are on your own. You are gone. Oh, you're unchangeable. [Music] Unchangeable and you're unstoppable. Oh, God. And that's who you are. Oh, you're unchangeable and unchangeable. My God, you're unstoppable. That's who you are. Oh, you're unchangeable. [Music] You're unchangeable in your arms. Oh my God, that's who you are. You are God alone from before time be. You are on your throne. You are gone old and right now in the good times in bed. You are on your throne. You are God alone and you are God alone. From before time be you are on your throne and you are God alone. And right now in the good times in bad you are on your throne. You are God alone. You are God alone from before time be. You are on your throne. You are God. And right now in the good times in bad you are on your throne. You are God alone. You're unchangeable. Unshakeable. You're unstoppable. That's who you are. You're unchangeable. &gt;&gt; Unshakeable. &gt;&gt; You're unstoppable. That's who you are. You're unchangeable and unshakeable. Oh, you're unstoppable. That's who you are. Oh, you're unchangeable and unshakeable and you're Oh my God, that's who you are. You're unchangeable [Music] and unshakeable. You're un Oh my God, that's who you are. You're unchangeable and unshakeable and unstoppable. That's who you are. You are God alone. Before time begin, you are on your throne. You are God. And right now in the good times and bad, you are on your throne. You are God alone. You are God alone. From before time began, you were on your throne and you are God. And right now in the good times and bad, &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; you are on your throne. &gt;&gt; You are still on your throne. &gt;&gt; You are God. &gt;&gt; You are still on your throne. &gt;&gt; Jesus, we bless your name. Yes. &gt;&gt; Would you just spread your hands out before the Lord and tell him your way is the right way. &gt;&gt; You've loved us with a love that we desire to be filled with and to love others with. &gt;&gt; We believe we believe in the word. We believe in a word that says that perfect love will reign in our lives. We believe that we'll never take a rapture without it. &gt;&gt; In our human logic, we we don't know how to get it or how to practice it, but we surrender ourselves to a sovereign God. &gt;&gt; We receive that perfect love from you, and we ask for grace. to love others with that love. &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe that every person in this room has the potential that you have placed in them to overcome the spirit of this age. I know that it has been said that every church is filled with three kinds of believers. But if I looked across this house today, I would find it very difficult to identify unbelievers. I believe Lord that most of us believe. Maybe we don't always let our lives measure up to what we believe and that makes us those who struggle in the in the realm of make believe. You said you were going to deal first with hypocrisy and your bride. One of the definitions of hypocrisy is to expect from others what we ourselves are not willing to be to live to do. Father help us. This is not who we desire to be. fill each one with an overcoming portion of who you are that we might have strength, Lord, until the hour that we could perhaps build in the day and watch in the night. May we pick up a sword in one hand and a tool in the other. And may we build while we fight and fight while we build, beating back the darkness, beating back the forces of hell that march against our families, against our heritage. and strength to build what has crumbled what the enemy has. He knew that if he could crumble the walls that he had us. May we raise up today to restore, to rebuild. May we arise and build. May we hear the call. May we stand shouldertosh shoulder not desiring that anybody would get out or be out but that everyone would be in &gt;&gt; that we could fight this thing together. Your grace is sufficient. I'm so glad. I'm glad Lord that at the end of the day it doesn't depend on our ability to do anything &gt;&gt; except yield. You're the one who comes to do it all in us. Strengthen us. May we strengthen our hands to both build and fight. May we push forward with everything that's within us, defeating the enemy, lifting one another up. If we see our brother or sister falling, may we offer a hand of support and compassion. May we not pity the spirit that's overtaken them, but may we go tell Jesus about it and not others. May what we have casually considered become a driving burden in passion in our lives. Be first, Jesus. Be first. May we wake up every morning desiring to make you first. Some dear friends of ours received some very devastating news this week concerning their son. I don't know that I have permission to call their name or his name, but they have experienced a great tragedy in their family already of losing a son, a dear son. And now they have a son who has been diagnosed as having a a brain tumor. We are believing that God is the same. &gt;&gt; The healer of the 50s and 60s, the healer of of Galilee, &gt;&gt; the healer of the New Testament is is Jehovah Rafa, our healer today. And we're going to lift up this young man to the Lord that he would receive healing. That it would not be such a long process. that it would not be Lord, we would desire that it would not be cancerous and that it be something that can either be treated or better than that disappear. &gt;&gt; But we want the little family to be lifted up and they have certainly stood with us and we want to see God move on their behalf. I want you to also as you leave today to remember Sister Sharon who expected to be here today but just was really uh ill and needed a touch from the Lord. We know that God is more than able. Our dear sister Audrey fights every day in great pain. She needs healing and deliverance from all that infirmity so that she can do it. I I long again one more time see her walk across the front of this church shouting with victory in her heart. Inspired me many many many times as her mother did before her. Inspired me their their joy and their liberty inspired my heart. May God touch sister Audrey today and give her victory. Lord, we lift up these needs of healing. And I'm sure there are others represented in this room who need healing as well. We just want to say before the God of heaven that we know you're the same &gt;&gt; and we know that it's such a small thing to us. It becomes so large that we don't even know how sometime to present our petition. But Lord, to you it's just a very simple thing. It's part of the atonement. &gt;&gt; And according to your will and divine purpose, you're more than able. Lord, you wouldn't even have to come. Just speak the word. Oh God, you wouldn't even have to point a finger. Just speak the word and we could receive our healing &gt;&gt; and the restoration of health &gt;&gt; that comes from you. We lift up this brother and his family to the Lord. &gt;&gt; That you would work again your miracle working power. &gt;&gt; There's no limitation. A tumor is no more than anything else. When you are on the case, &gt;&gt; Lord, would you get a testimony for your name out of this situation? &gt;&gt; I ask with humble heart but great faith, knowing that you're more than able and for others. &gt;&gt; We pray for one another right now. this beautiful body. Fill us all with more of you. Grace to help each other. Maybe you want to just touch someone. You're not taking a superior spiritual role. I'm not asking you to pray some prophetic word over them. I'm just asking you to join your faith with theirs. I join my faith with the one next to me now. We stand in the presence of God determined to be more than we've ever been before. Oh God, the walls. We see the walls. We see the condition of many things. We see another generation coming along, Lord, that just they don't they don't even hardly know. They don't hardly see. May they see what we've seen. May they see the pillar of fire moving among us. May they see a sold out prayer waring church so that they can take up the banner, the responsibility, run it forward. Lord, if I've allowed my mind or my mouth to speak against a a person, a family, a person in this body, instead of praying for them, we ask that you would forgive us and help us, Lord. May we build one another up in prayer. Thank you, Jesus. May we be faithful in all that you've called us to now as we need to go. Let's have sister Ginger and uh Olivia to come and stand here and let's gather around them. Brother Gley, you go for me, would you? and let's well you and lay hands on them and and uh I mean you know for us it it's looks like a glorious vacation. I wish somebody was sending me out of the country for that long. But there are other circumstances and Olivia's just seeming to pip out of her shell and we just we just hate to lose any ground because we can't hardly wait to see just who she'll be as she just pushes herself. If you have to sometime you you you do have to break out and push yourself a little out of your comfort zone so you'll even begin to know who you are in Christ. But let's surround them right now in prayer. Father, we we just stretch our faith toward them and these are precious among us. [Music] I saw the sweet pictures of Olivia when she was so small, so little, so broken. We thank you, Lord, for the courage Ginger had to take this journey. Amen. We just pray, oh God, that you will bless that little family as you've given Ginger to Brother Magnus and Magnus to Ginger and you've given Olivia first to Ginger and now to brother Magnus and they make this small but powerful little family. And we ask, oh God, that during this time, you will minister. Help them to bind together and know one another even in deeper ways. Each one just stepping up &gt;&gt; to be their role, their active role in the family. I'm not going to ask you to make Olivia not miss any of us or Ginger either, but I'm going to ask that your peace will be so real and that her friends and contacts won't forsake her that they'll reach out and stay in touch and you'll just bless them in this time and bring them back not uh starving but uh bring them back filled and ready for what you have appointed for us at tabernacles time. Bless them real good. Bless brother Magnus. He still has many responsibilities. Touch his body physically in every way. And continue, Lord, to give him amazing plans. Oh, how you've used him. We honor that and ask even for increase upon his life. May he know the joy, the real joy of a sweet little family. And may it bring extra strength to him in these days. And we praise you for your faithfulness to us. You're more faithful than we could ever be. But Lord, help us to also be faithful in all things. &gt;&gt; Let it be said. Sing that. [Music] &gt;&gt; You sisters, take an opportunity to squeeze them real tight. &gt;&gt; It's Christ alone. In Christ alone will I glory. Though I would know I could pride myself in battles. &gt;&gt; Sing as we get ready to go. &gt;&gt; For I've been blessed &gt;&gt; beyond measure. &gt;&gt; Blessed &gt;&gt; and by his strength alone I over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I could stop and count successes like diamonds in my hands. But those trophies could not equal to the grace by which I stand in Christ alone. I place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross. And let it be said in every victory. Let it be said of me that my source of strength. Lord, you are my source of hope is Christ alone. again. &gt;&gt; In Christ alone, I place all my trust and I find my glory in the power of the cross. In every victory, let it be said, I'll be my source of strength. Lord, you are my source of all is Christ alone. In Christ alone will I glory. For only by his grace I am redeemed. And only his tender mercy could reach beyond my weakness to my knees. [Music] And now I seek no greater honor than just to know him more than to count my gains but losses to the glory of my Lord. In Christ alone, I place my trust &gt;&gt; and find my glory in the power of the cross in every victory. Lord, let it be said of me that my source of strength. God, you are my source of hope is Christ alone. In Christ alone I place all my trust and I find my glory in the power of the cross, in every victory. Lord, let it be said of me that my source of strength. You are my source of hope is Christ alone. &gt;&gt; Christ alone will I glory &gt;&gt; though I could pride myself in battles. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; For I've been blessed beyond measure and by his strength alone I overcome. And oh I could stop and count successes like diamonds in my hands. But those trophies could not equal to the grace by which I stand. In Christ alone, I place my trust and I find my glory in the power of the cross, in every victory. Lord, let it be said of me that my source of strength. Oh my God, you are my source of hope is Christ alone. In Christ alone, I place all my trust and I find my glory in the power of the cross. In every victory, Lord, let it be said of me that my source of strength, my God, you are my source of hope is Christ alone. In Christ alone I place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross in every victory. Let it be said of me. And my source of strength and my source of hope is Christ alone. Sing it one last time like that. In Christ alone, I place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross. In every victory, Lord, let it be said of me. My source of strength, my source of hope in Christ alone. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
