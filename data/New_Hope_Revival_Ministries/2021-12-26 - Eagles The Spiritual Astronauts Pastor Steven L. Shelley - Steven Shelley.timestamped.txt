[57:30] i remember
[57:32] the hotel room
[57:34] where my wife and i
[57:38] then you nearly took my microphone off
[57:40] my head
[57:42] but it was a good hug
[57:48] my wife and i
[57:49] were gathered in a hotel room in
[57:51] virginia
[57:53] and the glory of the lord the presence
[57:55] of the lord had been coming that morning
[57:58] over she and i in waves
[58:01] just coming
[58:02] it came before we prayed it came before
[58:05] we started even thinking on the lord and
[58:07] the things of the lord it just came and
[58:09] it came in waves
[58:11] and it was appearing physically we could
[58:13] see it manifesting physically in the
[58:15] room
[58:16] like drops of oil falling
[58:19] and we thought well
[58:20] i thought my eyes are doing this and my
[58:23] wife was in the other room and she was
[58:25] thinking my eyes are doing this
[58:27] we met in the middle and said did you
[58:29] see that and she said yeah did you see
[58:31] that
[58:32] and we realized that god was really
[58:34] manifesting himself in a glory way and i
[58:36] wrote this song that you're singing
[58:38] right now under that inspiration
[58:41] as the anointing of the lord was falling
[58:43] i love when he comes when we ask him
[58:46] when we invite him i love that but i
[58:48] love when he just comes
[58:51] because he wants to be with us
[58:53] he just wants to be where you are
[58:56] there's nothing like that would you sing
[58:58] it with me one more time i
[59:01] feel the
[59:03] [Music]
[59:16] as it flows
[59:18] [Music]
[59:21] from
[59:22] the heavenlies
[59:29] and in
[59:31] [Music]
[59:44] let your
[59:46] anointing
[59:48] yes
[59:50] flow
[59:52] through
[59:53] me
[59:55] bring the music down just a tad i want
[59:57] to hear the saints sing that
[1:00:07] of your presence
[1:00:15] as it
[1:00:19] come on
[1:00:21] from the heavenly
[1:00:26] [Music]
[1:00:29] and
[1:00:30] then my
[1:00:32] soul
[1:00:34] cries
[1:00:36] [Music]
[1:00:42] my papa
[1:00:43] my papa

[1:00:47] anointing

[1:01:12] worthy is our lamb hallelujah
[1:01:15] [Applause]
[1:01:17] he is worthy
[1:01:21] he is worthy
[1:01:25] you may be seated this morning
[1:01:28] ben we're working you hard would you
[1:01:30] come and
[1:01:31] take this might just a minute
[1:01:38] i just don't think it would be right
[1:01:41] not to acknowledge the miracle in the
[1:01:43] room
[1:01:45] you know i think we ought to acknowledge
[1:01:46] that don't you
[1:01:51] i don't know if brother steve feels like
[1:01:53] saying anything or not but sister anita
[1:01:55] will i know for sure help us
[1:01:57] but if brother steve does he certainly
[1:02:00] can we'd love to hear his voice
[1:02:04] [Laughter]
[1:02:08] that's it
[1:02:09] [Laughter]
[1:02:12] he said i'll let it's on he said i'll
[1:02:14] let her go first that way we'll know how
[1:02:16] much time we have left
[1:02:17] [Laughter]
[1:02:19] well i just i just thank the lord for
[1:02:21] being here he's one to come for several
[1:02:22] weeks um he's hoping he can get back in
[1:02:24] his pulpit next week if at all possible
[1:02:26] wow um but you know we've had um today
[1:02:29] is two months two months that he was put
[1:02:32] in hospice care and
[1:02:34] we had we've had a battle since the lord
[1:02:36] has touched him um kind of like it's
[1:02:39] made me think about this morning about
[1:02:40] lazarus i'm sure after he came out of
[1:02:42] that tomb there are many trying to take
[1:02:44] him
[1:02:45] take him down because they didn't want
[1:02:47] to acknowledge the miracle no but when
[1:02:50] we went back to the hospital and there
[1:02:51] was a lot of circumstances and fights to
[1:02:53] even get back to cancer treatment center
[1:02:56] um stephen on the way said i want i want
[1:02:58] to call brother shelly and so we called
[1:03:00] brother shelly and i i was not at peace
[1:03:03] because i didn't know if they'd even
[1:03:04] take us back
[1:03:06] but uh one of the things that we prayed
[1:03:08] was that dr pannell the one who actually
[1:03:10] prayed over him many times and anointed
[1:03:11] him with oil would be the one that was
[1:03:13] on call that day which is very you know
[1:03:16] it's a touch and go situation you don't
[1:03:17] know but he was hallelujah and so when
[1:03:20] we walked in and i saw him walking down
[1:03:21] the hallway i started grinning because i
[1:03:23] knew he was going to be as shocked as
[1:03:25] a lot of them were
[1:03:27] but when he walked into the room after
[1:03:29] the scan he told stephen he said you are
[1:03:31] a miracle
[1:03:33] and god healed a perforated bowel and if
[1:03:35] any i know brother zach's gone through
[1:03:37] that as well but when your bowels have
[1:03:39] filled up your stomach cavity there is
[1:03:41] no option but surgery or death no other
[1:03:44] option but god performed the surgery on
[1:03:46] stephen hallelujah he did it
[1:03:48] he did it praise god he did hallelujah
[1:03:54] [Applause]
[1:03:56] so whenever dr pennell told us the news
[1:03:59] he was so excited because he's the one
[1:04:01] who was with tears just in his eyes he
[1:04:03] said this is the part of my job i hate
[1:04:05] because there's nothing we can do for
[1:04:07] him but send him home and making
[1:04:09] comforter comfortable and put him in
[1:04:10] hospice and i was like
[1:04:12] are you saying what i think you're
[1:04:13] saying he said yes he's at the end of
[1:04:15] his days
[1:04:16] and so i want anybody that doesn't
[1:04:18] believe god does miracles you're looking
[1:04:20] at one right here you're looking one
[1:04:22] right here
[1:04:23] and i don't understand
[1:04:25] [Music]
[1:04:32] praise the lord
[1:04:34] [Applause]
[1:04:36] i don't understand and i've wondered
[1:04:37] about this for the past couple weeks
[1:04:39] with brother zachary
[1:04:40] why that happens to be the part of the
[1:04:42] body that's being targeted right now but
[1:04:44] you know what i remember a sister tell
[1:04:46] me a long time ago that the colon
[1:04:48] represents not being able to let things
[1:04:50] go
[1:04:50] you know and i think that has maybe has
[1:04:52] a lot to do with it a lot of people get
[1:04:53] sick because they can't let things
[1:04:55] that's the truth and so if you're
[1:04:56] holding on to anything that would cause
[1:04:58] sickness in your physical spiritual yeah
[1:05:00] or any uh come on especially the
[1:05:02] physical and spiritual body let it go
[1:05:05] yes you know there are people and i
[1:05:07] really wouldn't say this any other time
[1:05:09] but i've seen god do so much there is
[1:05:11] nothing there is no person there's no
[1:05:14] circumstances that is worth you losing
[1:05:16] out in this last day
[1:05:18] nothing
[1:05:20] nothing
[1:05:21] and if you if you have a song or if you
[1:05:23] if you're sitting down on stuff because
[1:05:25] you have a grudge you better let go of
[1:05:26] it right now
[1:05:27] it is not worth it but i'm going to let
[1:05:30] my husband go on but i just want y'all
[1:05:31] to continue to pray because we're
[1:05:33] shocked because for some reason we have
[1:05:34] an appointment on january the 7th with
[1:05:36] oncologists and we don't know what
[1:05:37] that's about so i'm praying that they're
[1:05:39] going to start digging into what god's
[1:05:41] doing
[1:05:42] amen amen
[1:05:48] praise the lord
[1:05:50] well there were so many things that had
[1:05:52] taken place even in our hospitalization
[1:05:56] that uh
[1:05:57] you know the nurses
[1:05:59] acknowledged god yes the doctors
[1:06:02] acknowledged the lord
[1:06:04] her father
[1:06:06] began to acknowledge god and what god
[1:06:09] was doing he said surely god has done
[1:06:11] this
[1:06:12] and he's never been one to
[1:06:14] give god the glory for anything he's
[1:06:17] been
[1:06:18] uh you know away from god and all this
[1:06:22] but uh
[1:06:24] and we're just seeing so many miracles
[1:06:27] and no matter what you're going through
[1:06:29] god has a purpose yes he does you go
[1:06:31] through it might be
[1:06:33] your pain
[1:06:34] it might be your sorrow it might be
[1:06:36] something that god is going to use yes
[1:06:39] to to win somebody over to give somebody
[1:06:43] the faith that they need so uh just keep
[1:06:47] encouraging yourself have faith
[1:06:50] and david encouraged himself in the lord
[1:06:53] even when he was going through
[1:06:56] troubles and trials
[1:06:58] and things he encouraged
[1:07:00] himself
[1:07:01] in the lord yes
[1:07:03] and and as he and did that
[1:07:06] it inspired his
[1:07:08] men
[1:07:09] it inspired those around him to
[1:07:12] to pick up their swords to fight to move
[1:07:15] on
[1:07:16] uh this mountain is ours hallelujah
[1:07:19] this battle is ours

[1:07:23] battle is yours

[1:07:27] encourage yourself in the lord yes and
[1:07:29] let god
[1:07:31] do some wonderful things that he's
[1:07:33] wanting to do yes
[1:07:36] god bless this church

[1:07:47] that

[1:07:51] and encouraged us through the prayers of

[1:10:53] we we've never met is that right
[1:10:57] i can't hear him
[1:10:59] yes we've never met
[1:11:01] we've only had just a little bit of
[1:11:02] correspondence
[1:11:04] the reason i'm asking that is i don't i
[1:11:06] don't know too much about our brother
[1:11:08] we're very glad that he is here but when
[1:11:10] i woke up this morning the lord spoke to
[1:11:11] my heart
[1:11:13] and uh very directly and and asked me he
[1:11:16] didn't tell me it was a little bit
[1:11:18] strange the language that came to me but
[1:11:20] he asked me to sing this brother a song
[1:11:23] so i'm going to sing him a song i don't
[1:11:25] know if it'll be something that
[1:11:28] he likes i don't know what his style
[1:11:30] would be
[1:11:31] but it's the words and the lord wanted
[1:11:33] him to hear this song this morning he
[1:11:35] may have already heard it on the stream
[1:11:36] but this is
[1:11:38] for him
[1:11:43] [Music]
[1:11:57] i was
[1:11:59] standing on
[1:12:01] a mountain
[1:12:04] i was looking
[1:12:06] towards the sky
[1:12:11] when i saw a storm
[1:12:15] approaching
[1:12:18] and i feared
[1:12:20] that i would die
[1:12:25] saw god's creatures
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:30] run and seek
[1:12:32] a better place to hide
[1:12:39] i heard the thunder
[1:12:41] roll
[1:12:42] down in my soul
[1:12:46] then i bowed
[1:12:49] my head
[1:12:53] and cried
[1:12:55] [Music]
[1:12:59] now the clouds
[1:13:02] were moving
[1:13:04] faster
[1:13:07] and the lightning was
[1:13:09] flashing bright
[1:13:14] and the clouds so dark they hid the
[1:13:18] light
[1:13:19] of the sun
[1:13:21] and it seemed
[1:13:23] that it was night
[1:13:28] when all it wants
[1:13:31] there was
[1:13:32] a feeling
[1:13:33] [Music]
[1:13:34] like i've never
[1:13:37] had before
[1:13:42] up above the storm
[1:13:45] you should have heard me sing
[1:13:48] god had given me
[1:13:52] [Music]
[1:14:00] it with me this morning so spread your
[1:14:03] [Music]
[1:14:05] wings
[1:14:06] little eggo
[1:14:10] and
[1:14:14] [Music]
[1:14:16] you weren't born
[1:14:19] to live down in the valley
[1:14:22] no
[1:14:24] you were born
[1:14:26] to soar through the sky
[1:14:30] don't let your trials
[1:14:34] bring you down
[1:14:37] or drive your spirit low
[1:14:44] [Music]
[1:14:52] and fly
[1:14:59] now all at once
[1:15:01] his spirit
[1:15:03] [Music]
[1:15:04] lifted me
[1:15:06] till i was high above
[1:15:10] it all
[1:15:12] [Music]
[1:15:14] you know i never even had
[1:15:17] to move
[1:15:19] my wings
[1:15:21] the holy spirit
[1:15:23] he had took
[1:15:24] control
[1:15:27] i was soaring
[1:15:30] high
[1:15:31] above my
[1:15:32] circumstances
[1:15:35] my
[1:15:36] confusion and all
[1:15:38] my pain
[1:15:39] [Applause]
[1:15:41] and though i had spent
[1:15:44] many years in that old barnyard
[1:15:48] i was always an eagle
[1:15:53] by
[1:15:56] his name
[1:15:58] so spread your
[1:16:01] wings
[1:16:03] little
[1:16:07] and fly
[1:16:11] [Music]
[1:16:12] listen
[1:16:13] you were not born
[1:16:16] to peck around in this old dark valley
[1:16:20] oh
[1:16:21] you were elected
[1:16:23] to soar
[1:16:24] through the sky
[1:16:27] don't let your trials
[1:16:31] bring you down
[1:16:34] or drive your spirit low
[1:16:39] to the ground
[1:16:41] mount up with wings
[1:16:45] little ears
[1:16:53] here's the key
[1:16:55] keep your eyes
[1:16:58] upon
[1:17:00] god's son
[1:17:06] the
[1:17:07] battle
[1:17:08] it's
[1:17:09] nearly one
[1:17:15] up where
[1:17:17] the wings
[1:17:21] little eggs
[1:17:24] [Music]

[1:17:50] thing to wake up to this morning but the
[1:17:52] lord is good
[1:17:53] and he knows all things
[1:17:56] thank you mary beth i appreciate that so
[1:17:58] much would you give thanks to god for

[1:18:10] the texts were beginning to come in of
[1:18:12] those who were
[1:18:13] unwell and unable to be here this
[1:18:15] morning and i'm just thinking lord i
[1:18:17] wonder who will be here and you look you

[1:18:20] and there's some of you i never have a
[1:18:22] doubt about
[1:18:23] i know you're going to be here come hell
[1:18:25] high water is that ugly did i just say
[1:18:28] something ugly if i did i didn't mean to
[1:18:31] yes ma'am

[1:18:38] [Music]
[1:18:52] and i'm telling you don't come back from
[1:18:54] that and i'm telling you what god can do
[1:18:57] he gave them no hope i was branded i was
[1:19:01] everything but god
[1:19:03] god and i'm telling you
[1:19:14] yes
[1:19:17] come on
[1:19:33] yes
[1:19:34] yes
[1:19:37] amen
[1:19:39] [Music]
[1:19:42] hallelujah
[1:19:47] that's perfectly in order amen turn to
[1:19:51] isaiah chapter 40.
[1:19:53] i want to
[1:19:55] give you a little of what the lord has
[1:19:57] given me for this morning
[1:19:59] we had the privilege on friday of
[1:20:02] addressing the virtual convention
[1:20:06] uh out of pastor tay's church in tema
[1:20:09] ghana west africa where we have been
[1:20:12] nearly a dozen times now
[1:20:14] and god has blessed that group and
[1:20:16] you've met pastor tay and you've met
[1:20:19] his son jesse and you've seen the
[1:20:22] pictures of how they grew from a small
[1:20:24] place to what god has given them today
[1:20:27] and it just keeps expanding
[1:20:29] every time we we get pictures we're
[1:20:32] getting updates and god's just adding
[1:20:34] numbers to the church and
[1:20:36] and increasing their facility and but
[1:20:39] there are still some coveted
[1:20:40] restrictions in place
[1:20:42] and so there has to be social distancing
[1:20:45] in the sanctuary which requires a chair
[1:20:48] and then about six feet and a chair and
[1:20:50] about six feet and so
[1:20:52] uh a building that's usually can can be
[1:20:55] easily filled a couple thousand people
[1:20:58] that greatly reduces the number of folks
[1:21:01] that were able to be in the building so
[1:21:03] uh we couldn't travel to ghana this year
[1:21:06] as we have many christmas uh holidays
[1:21:09] and so we were able to address the body
[1:21:11] and open the conference for them on
[1:21:14] friday and the theme of the meetings
[1:21:16] were spiritual astronauts
[1:21:19] that's a pretty good theme isn't it
[1:21:22] and so the lord moved and we're getting
[1:21:24] some reports already of how god moved
[1:21:26] and i was able to catch a little of the
[1:21:28] service yesterday
[1:21:30] from pastor imprium who pastors up in
[1:21:34] obwasi ghana which is up in the gold
[1:21:37] coast and we were there with him the
[1:21:39] last time we were there and and uh god
[1:21:42] really used our brother i tell you i was
[1:21:45] greatly blessed
[1:21:47] so i was thinking about
[1:21:49] spiritual astronauts and living in the
[1:21:51] heights and
[1:21:52] these things were in my mind but i had
[1:21:55] no intention of bringing any of that
[1:21:57] today
[1:21:58] when i when i heard the lord dealing
[1:22:00] with my heart this morning when i woke
[1:22:02] up
[1:22:02] he was taking me in another direction
[1:22:04] for this service and so we will just
[1:22:07] go with god isn't that a good idea you
[1:22:09] think that's a good plan
[1:22:11] verse 28 of isaiah 40
[1:22:14] hast thou
[1:22:15] not known
[1:22:17] hast thou not heard
[1:22:19] that the everlasting god the lord the
[1:22:23] creator of the ends of the earth
[1:22:26] fainteth not neither is weary how many
[1:22:30] of you have heard this about our god
[1:22:32] he does not faint
[1:22:34] he never grows weary
[1:22:37] he never slumbers
[1:22:39] he never sleeps
[1:22:41] there is no searching of his
[1:22:43] understanding
[1:22:45] you could never reach the end of all god
[1:22:47] knows
[1:22:49] hallelujah
[1:22:51] the next verse
[1:22:53] he giveth power to the faint didn't you
[1:22:57] just hear sister beth
[1:22:59] living testimony he gives power to the
[1:23:02] faint didn't you just hear sister anita
[1:23:05] and brother steve
[1:23:06] he gives power to the faint
[1:23:09] and to them that have no might
[1:23:14] no personal strength or power he
[1:23:16] increaseth strength
[1:23:19] does this sound like our god today
[1:23:22] hallelujah amen it does
[1:23:25] even the youths
[1:23:28] shall faint
[1:23:29] and be weary
[1:23:31] and the young men
[1:23:33] shall utterly fall
[1:23:35] has there ever been an hour where we
[1:23:37] hear even our children
[1:23:39] being exhausted
[1:23:41] stressed out
[1:23:43] worn out you asked some of these
[1:23:45] children what's wrong with you two three
[1:23:47] years old i'm exhausted
[1:23:50] you wonder where they get such a big
[1:23:51] word i'm worn out well i don't know if i
[1:23:54] always believe that but here the bible
[1:23:57] said so
[1:23:58] even the youth shall faint and be weary
[1:24:01] and the young men shall utterly fall
[1:24:05] but they
[1:24:06] that wait
[1:24:10] hallelujah
[1:24:11] they that wade upon the lord
[1:24:15] shall
[1:24:17] renew
[1:24:19] their strength
[1:24:21] i'm reading it like that because i want
[1:24:23] to emphasize it in your heart
[1:24:26] i want it to go beyond your ears and
[1:24:28] into your spirit today and i want you to
[1:24:31] know if we can wade upon the lord
[1:24:35] and that doesn't mean sit around and do
[1:24:36] nothing
[1:24:38] we can serve him the word wade in hebrew
[1:24:41] means to to serve it means not to
[1:24:44] abandon your responsibility
[1:24:48] they that wade upon the lord shall renew
[1:24:51] their strength they shall mound up with
[1:24:54] wings
[1:24:55] as
[1:24:56] eagles
[1:24:58] they shall run and not be weary and they
[1:25:02] shall walk and
[1:25:06] not
[1:25:08] faint
[1:25:10] now let's look at verse 31 in the
[1:25:12] amplified before we move on
[1:25:17] but those who wait for the lord
[1:25:22] who expect
[1:25:24] who look for and hope in him
[1:25:29] shall change
[1:25:31] and renew
[1:25:33] their strength
[1:25:34] and power
[1:25:36] they shall lift their wings and mount up
[1:25:40] close to god
[1:25:42] as eagles mount up to the sun
[1:25:46] they shall run and not be weary
[1:25:49] they shall walk and not faint or become
[1:25:55] tired
[1:25:57] how many of you want to claim that kind
[1:25:59] of a promise this morning it's yours
[1:26:01] let's pray
[1:26:03] heavenly father we thank you lord that
[1:26:06] in a busy time holiday time like what
[1:26:10] the world is going through right now
[1:26:13] and many taking advantage of these days
[1:26:17] to visit with friends
[1:26:20] enjoying time off work and being able to
[1:26:24] be reunited with family in various
[1:26:27] places we bless that and we thank you
[1:26:31] for giving
[1:26:32] the opportunity for such fellowship
[1:26:36] but lord we are here today gathered in
[1:26:39] your name believing that you have an
[1:26:42] appointment with us
[1:26:44] and that there is a purpose and a reason
[1:26:46] for us being here today and lord we have
[1:26:49] come to hear from you
[1:26:51] we're not here to hear from flesh alone
[1:26:54] but we're here to hear what you would
[1:26:57] have to say to us
[1:26:59] for no one knows us like you do papa you
[1:27:03] know us like no other
[1:27:05] and today we ask that you would give us
[1:27:09] the grace to be untethered
[1:27:12] to no longer be earth bound
[1:27:16] as it has been spoken already today that
[1:27:20] we be able to let go
[1:27:23] and let god have his wonderful way
[1:27:28] may we not carry any dead weight around
[1:27:31] our shoulders
[1:27:33] but may we soar
[1:27:35] into the highest heights
[1:27:37] of what you have for us in this hour and
[1:27:41] i claim and pray like now for sister
[1:27:44] tebow who has reached out for prayer
[1:27:48] over the course of the last few days
[1:27:52] you are her healer you are her strength
[1:27:56] you have sent your word to heal her and
[1:27:59] lord we stand with her right now
[1:28:02] believing that you will renew her body
[1:28:06] that you will curse the root of the
[1:28:08] disease that desires to take her from
[1:28:11] our midst we ask oh god that you renew
[1:28:15] her youth
[1:28:17] and her strength
[1:28:19] her faith be anointed in such an hour as
[1:28:23] this
[1:28:24] we claim this promise
[1:28:26] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:28:30] amen and the saint said
[1:28:33] you may be seated this morning we need
[1:28:35] to move along
[1:28:37] maybe you as a believer
[1:28:40] of an end-time message
[1:28:43] maybe you are weary of the analogy
[1:28:47] of the eagle
[1:28:49] maybe you have heard it so many times
[1:28:52] and thought about it so many times
[1:28:55] until it almost seems impersonal
[1:28:58] and you don't really feel your
[1:29:01] identification
[1:29:03] with an eagle
[1:29:05] i agree that we can ponder something for
[1:29:08] so long and it becomes common to us and
[1:29:11] we
[1:29:12] miss
[1:29:13] but i can't forget the time
[1:29:17] many years ago now in the late 80s
[1:29:20] that the voice of the lord spoke clearly
[1:29:23] to my heart i didn't understand what he
[1:29:25] meant
[1:29:26] i didn't know what he was talking about
[1:29:28] but he just spoke very
[1:29:30] clearly and nearly audibly
[1:29:33] into my inner being and he said surround
[1:29:36] yourself with eagles
[1:29:40] well it sounded nice
[1:29:42] i knew his voice i had no doubt that it
[1:29:45] was the spirit speaking to my life
[1:29:49] but neither did i have any idea how to
[1:29:52] practically walk it out
[1:29:55] how does one surround themselves
[1:29:59] with eagles
[1:30:01] i didn't know how
[1:30:03] i didn't think that i could go to some
[1:30:05] birds of prey center and become involved
[1:30:08] in the work that they do in saving the
[1:30:11] eagle
[1:30:13] i just only thought came to my mind i
[1:30:15] know exactly where i was in north
[1:30:17] carolina when he spoke that to me and in
[1:30:20] that little mountain town there were all
[1:30:23] kinds of shops and one day uh
[1:30:26] just before i was going to meet someone
[1:30:28] for lunch i stopped into a little
[1:30:31] christian bookstore surprise to find one
[1:30:35] uh in this little town
[1:30:37] boone north carolina is where i was
[1:30:40] meeting someone for lunch
[1:30:42] and it seemed like they had a whole
[1:30:44] section of eagles this was in the 80s
[1:30:48] whole section of eagles beautiful eagle
[1:30:51] painting and and and all kinds of little
[1:30:54] statues and statuettes and plaques and
[1:30:59] little things and i thought my these are
[1:31:01] nice things
[1:31:03] uh the lord spoke to me to surround
[1:31:06] myself with eagles so i i might just
[1:31:08] take a few of these little things home
[1:31:10] with me and hang them in my office
[1:31:14] and physically surround myself with the
[1:31:17] beauty of the eagle i'd always been
[1:31:20] fascinated by an eagle now i'd always
[1:31:22] told everybody it was my favorite bird
[1:31:25] but i still didn't know the significance
[1:31:28] of surrounding myself with eagles so i
[1:31:31] was just looking for a way that it might
[1:31:34] i might could take some kind of physical
[1:31:36] action little did i know that god was
[1:31:40] speaking to me about overcomers he was
[1:31:43] talking to me about a people who had
[1:31:46] been given a certain diet and that diet
[1:31:49] was strengthening them to rise above to
[1:31:54] get up higher than all the stuff that
[1:31:57] was going on in their lives i didn't
[1:31:59] know that god was talking to me about a
[1:32:02] message that would be eagle food it
[1:32:05] would become foolishness to many but to
[1:32:08] those who have been touched and called
[1:32:12] and elected for such a purpose it would
[1:32:14] become the reason that we live and i can
[1:32:18] say today that that truth has become the
[1:32:21] reason that i exist today because i see
[1:32:24] a little bride being built all around
[1:32:28] the world i know they are spiritual
[1:32:31] astronauts i know they are called to be
[1:32:34] eagles i know that there are many
[1:32:38] characteristics in the natural eagle
[1:32:41] that also apply to the believer in the
[1:32:44] spiritual and i don't want to lose sight
[1:32:47] of that because i like you can get
[1:32:50] bogged down in what's going on in my
[1:32:52] life and i can get weary and i can
[1:32:56] grieve how many of you know you don't
[1:32:58] just have to have a death in your family
[1:33:00] to grieve we grieve over anything that's
[1:33:04] taken from us or that we lose and i like
[1:33:08] you can get bogged down in the darkness
[1:33:10] of the moment in the heaviness of the
[1:33:13] moment and momentarily forget who i am
[1:33:16] but i want you to know the spirit of god
[1:33:19] in such an hour as we are leaving 2021
[1:33:23] and moving into 2022 we are leaving
[1:33:26] something behind and we are stretching
[1:33:29] forward to grab a hold of something in
[1:33:32] this coming year not because the
[1:33:34] calendar has changed but because we know
[1:33:37] we are getting closer and closer and
[1:33:40] closer to the culmination of everything
[1:33:43] that god has promised that he wanted to
[1:33:45] do for his bride and then through his
[1:33:49] bride and then she'll take that ultimate
[1:33:52] flight
[1:33:53] rapture grace how many of you are
[1:33:55] looking for that
[1:33:57] we're looking for that
[1:33:59] that is our ultimate way out
[1:34:02] you know the the denominational
[1:34:04] christians make fun of us sometime
[1:34:07] because we still believe in a rapture
[1:34:10] and they like to believe that they're
[1:34:12] they're going to have to press through
[1:34:14] great tribulation i have no problem with
[1:34:17] that teaching because i think for the
[1:34:19] majority of folks it's nothing but their
[1:34:22] truth
[1:34:24] but i want you to know there are people
[1:34:26] in the earth that are not appointed to
[1:34:28] wrath
[1:34:29] i want to remind you that there are
[1:34:32] those that god saw from before the
[1:34:34] foundation of the world that would not
[1:34:37] be lost in satan's eden nor would they
[1:34:40] be confused under those blasphemous
[1:34:42] names but they would recognize who they
[1:34:46] are and they would overcome all things
[1:34:50] i want to say it again all things i want
[1:34:54] you to help me a little bit this morning
[1:34:56] because i see the need just like you do
[1:34:59] for every one of us in this hour to get
[1:35:02] up above
[1:35:04] i've been watching you press
[1:35:06] don't get weary now
[1:35:08] don't be weary in well-doing
[1:35:11] for you will reap in due season if you
[1:35:15] faint not you keep pressing into praise
[1:35:19] you kept pushing in to worship him if
[1:35:22] you feel dry as a bone praise him anyway
[1:35:25] if you feel lonesome and detached from
[1:35:28] god you just draw up and praise him
[1:35:32] anyway refuse to be discouraged and
[1:35:35] pushed out
[1:35:36] run right back in take a hold of your
[1:35:39] promise and praise god
[1:35:42] until the reality of that promise is
[1:35:44] made known you believe it works
[1:35:47] i'm going to have to pull a minute you
[1:35:49] believe that works
[1:35:51] in the message putting on the whole
[1:35:53] armor of god
[1:35:55] nothing could be more important
[1:35:57] in this hour than making sure you are
[1:36:01] putting on the whole armor of god if
[1:36:05] you've done it today you'll need to do
[1:36:06] it again tomorrow
[1:36:08] it's something that we have a tendency
[1:36:10] to lay down in the midst of the battle
[1:36:14] in paragraph 82 brother branham said the
[1:36:17] chief this was the first one thank you
[1:36:19] the chief is leading
[1:36:21] leading us home amen come on home
[1:36:25] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:36:29] if it wasn't so i'd have told you i'll
[1:36:32] not leave you comfortless i'll come
[1:36:34] again and be with you
[1:36:37] even in you to the end of the world
[1:36:41] that's a couple of scriptures combined
[1:36:43] but it's our good news today isn't it
[1:36:46] the works that i do
[1:36:48] shall you do also a little while in the
[1:36:50] world seeth me no more yet ye shall see
[1:36:54] me for i'll be with you even in you to
[1:36:56] the end of the world chief
[1:36:58] leading on amen
[1:37:01] now my lord knows the way
[1:37:04] through the wilderness do you believe
[1:37:06] that
[1:37:08] all i have to do is
[1:37:11] he knows the way
[1:37:13] somebody said i can't see the future
[1:37:16] i can't see five minutes
[1:37:19] ahead of where i'm living right now i
[1:37:21] know that and i understand that but i
[1:37:23] need to remind you that your chief has
[1:37:26] already gone before you
[1:37:28] he already knows the way
[1:37:31] here we are living underneath the
[1:37:33] restriction and boundary of time but
[1:37:36] where he lives where he sees from how he
[1:37:39] ministers in that realm there is no
[1:37:42] limitation of time it's all eternity he
[1:37:46] sees the end from the beginning and the
[1:37:48] beginning from the end he knows the way
[1:37:50] through the wilderness my lord knows the
[1:37:54] way
[1:37:55] through the wilderness that you're
[1:37:58] walking through right now all you have
[1:38:00] to do is follow amen he said here the
[1:38:03] trump trump tramping of the army
[1:38:06] marching on to victory
[1:38:08] not paying any attention to all this
[1:38:11] unbelief
[1:38:12] and all crows and buzzards hollering
[1:38:16] around here
[1:38:17] how about reading that for me
[1:38:21] we're eagles
[1:38:23] we're eagles can help what the sparrows
[1:38:26] are doing we're eagles can't be
[1:38:28] distracted by what the crows are doing
[1:38:31] we're eagles
[1:38:35] let's soar out of
[1:38:42] you're you're talking like
[1:38:44] i can just do it
[1:38:51] at will i can just
[1:38:53] get above it
[1:38:56] you're understanding me
[1:38:59] you're not misunderstanding me
[1:39:01] you are understanding me
[1:39:04] because we know that our atmosphere is
[1:39:07] controlled by our mindset
[1:39:12] if you've got a mindset for the valley
[1:39:14] the valley is where you're going to peck
[1:39:16] around
[1:39:18] if you've got a mindset just to get
[1:39:20] above the heads of somebody else that's
[1:39:22] about how high you'll fly
[1:39:25] you'll look around and say well at least
[1:39:26] i'm better off than he is
[1:39:30] you know that's not your goal just to
[1:39:32] get up a little above somebody in your
[1:39:33] family
[1:39:35] or somebody in your church
[1:39:37] you've got something more of pulling on
[1:39:39] you than to just get up above a little
[1:39:41] circumstance you've got a whole heaven
[1:39:44] out there that's calling you to higher
[1:39:47] heights
[1:39:49] to new dimensions
[1:39:51] to new realms of the spirit that you and
[1:39:54] i have only
[1:39:56] pecked into
[1:39:57] tapped into
[1:39:59] and we're called to be are you with me
[1:40:02] we're called to be immersed in those
[1:40:04] things
[1:40:05] not just taste them like appetizers in a
[1:40:08] meal but we are to feast on the hope and
[1:40:11] the promise that god has given us i've
[1:40:13] got some things for you that you've
[1:40:15] never walked in and you've never known
[1:40:17] and you've never understood so many
[1:40:19] around this message put everything in
[1:40:21] the past but i noticed the prophet never
[1:40:24] put anything in the past he had a
[1:40:26] tendency to call even the future into
[1:40:29] the present
[1:40:32] he'd look out there and see what god was
[1:40:34] going to do and then he'd say he's doing
[1:40:36] it
[1:40:38] where is somebody going to take that
[1:40:40] kind of an example today and look out
[1:40:43] there at what god is going to do and
[1:40:45] what he's promised to do and raise up
[1:40:47] and say he's doing it
[1:40:50] somebody said well i'm not experiencing
[1:40:53] that just because you and i are not
[1:40:55] experiencing that doesn't mean that it's
[1:40:58] not true doesn't mean that god's not
[1:41:01] doing it somewhere for those who believe
[1:41:05] so i encourage you dare
[1:41:08] to believe
[1:41:09] to take god at his word
[1:41:12] you know uh
[1:41:14] well let's go on we're eagles
[1:41:17] let's soar out of everything
[1:41:19] amen our theme for
[1:41:21] camp meeting messages where
[1:41:23] how to overcome
[1:41:25] anything and
[1:41:27] that's how we get above it
[1:41:29] how do you overcome anything you get
[1:41:31] above it how do you get above it you
[1:41:33] change your atmosphere by changing your
[1:41:35] mindset how do you change your mindset
[1:41:37] by changing your thoughts oh hallelujah
[1:41:40] i could go to bed depressed and
[1:41:42] discouraged and wake up and something
[1:41:44] has happened
[1:41:47] because he keeps trying to pull me up
[1:41:48] into something more than what i'm
[1:41:50] willing to pull myself up into sometime
[1:41:53] hallelujah i have hope i want you to
[1:41:56] know hope's a powerful force it takes
[1:41:58] more than hope to get the job done but
[1:42:00] hope will keep you pointed in the right
[1:42:02] direction until your faith can be
[1:42:04] anointed the enemy wants you hopeless
[1:42:07] the enemy wants you to feel bankrupt
[1:42:10] and helpless and that there's no way out
[1:42:14] of the situation that you're in right
[1:42:16] now but i want you to know there is
[1:42:19] and even greater
[1:42:21] some of you that are believing god for
[1:42:23] great promises in your life i want to
[1:42:25] tell you this morning under the
[1:42:26] inspiration of the holy spirit that
[1:42:29] you're not even really believing for the
[1:42:31] fullness of what he has because he
[1:42:32] hasn't even let you know the whole what
[1:42:35] we're operating on now is just what he
[1:42:37] lets us get a hold of a glimpse here and
[1:42:40] there but the half has never yet been
[1:42:42] told of what god desires to do in you
[1:42:46] and through you
[1:42:49] a harvest will follow a quick short work
[1:42:53] and then a
[1:42:54] rapture hallelujah then you can ask one
[1:42:58] another how do i look leave in this
[1:43:00] world
[1:43:01] eagles are high flyers
[1:43:03] i want to know if there are any high
[1:43:04] flyers in here well i'm not flying too
[1:43:07] high this morning
[1:43:11] you don't have to tell me that i can
[1:43:13] look at you
[1:43:14] [Music]
[1:43:15] but we are
[1:43:18] we are
[1:43:20] somebody said well i just feel like i
[1:43:22] can't hardly get my head above water
[1:43:24] been there
[1:43:26] done that
[1:43:28] you know when i try to preach positive
[1:43:30] sometimes some folks don't want me to
[1:43:33] because you're not feeling very positive
[1:43:36] but i want you to know if somebody don't
[1:43:37] pull on you every now and again you
[1:43:39] never will feel any different than you
[1:43:41] feel right now
[1:43:43] if somebody doesn't somehow bring a
[1:43:45] little bit of that in to your
[1:43:46] perspective let you see a little bit
[1:43:48] that god i tell you in his name god has
[1:43:51] not forgotten you
[1:43:53] he knows exactly where you are what
[1:43:55] you're going through how you feel what
[1:43:58] you thought what you're thinking right
[1:44:00] now
[1:44:02] he sees it
[1:44:03] and he's still calling you like an eagle
[1:44:06] that's soar out of everything
[1:44:08] eagles are high flyers
[1:44:11] oh
[1:44:12] we are better suited in the heights
[1:44:14] you get us down here among the things of
[1:44:16] this world and we get
[1:44:18] awkward and we trip over one another
[1:44:22] we don't know how to greet one another
[1:44:24] sometime isn't that a shame we don't
[1:44:26] know how to act around one another
[1:44:29] we clam up sometime
[1:44:31] we act like a bunch of misfits a bunch
[1:44:34] of screws nuts and bolts and
[1:44:40] did i make did
[1:44:41] that sound bad
[1:44:44] i was trying to get a hold of something
[1:44:46] the prophet said about
[1:44:48] it's all right to be a nut
[1:44:50] i'm so glad he said that brother david
[1:44:53] man i'm so glad he gave you and i'm
[1:44:55] permission to be nuts
[1:44:57] he said it's all right to be a nut as
[1:45:00] long as you're threaded to the right
[1:45:02] bolds
[1:45:04] that bolt is jesus christ
[1:45:07] as long as you know who you're attached
[1:45:09] to doesn't matter how you feel sometime
[1:45:13] somebody go on the trip and come back we
[1:45:15] act like we've never seen them don't
[1:45:16] even know who they are we feel so
[1:45:17] awkward they act like they've never been
[1:45:19] to church
[1:45:21] we have to get around each other and
[1:45:22] learn you know why you know why we get
[1:45:24] so awkward some time of the enemy is in
[1:45:26] that and he inspires that and he
[1:45:29] breathes on that but you know why we get
[1:45:31] like that sometimes because we are not
[1:45:33] made for this old world
[1:45:36] we were made for a higher plane
[1:45:39] we were built i want you to know
[1:45:42] we are specially built for the heights
[1:45:48] we don't function the same in the low
[1:45:50] land
[1:45:52] that we function when we get up above
[1:45:54] the snake line
[1:45:56] hallelujah so what do we do we say come
[1:45:59] lord and take me
[1:46:01] right where i belong
[1:46:04] we got to hurry
[1:46:05] did you know the eagle
[1:46:07] he likes to fly
[1:46:09] at about ten thousand
[1:46:10] feet the average jets flying about 30 to
[1:46:13] 35 000 feet and an eagle likes to go a
[1:46:16] third of that
[1:46:18] and the eagles have been have been
[1:46:20] spotted going higher than that but they
[1:46:23] they like to fly at about 10 000 feet if
[1:46:25] they stayed that high you not never see
[1:46:27] them
[1:46:28] so i'm very thankful for those who come
[1:46:30] dipping down over the campground
[1:46:33] maribeth sometimes thinks of me and she
[1:46:36] sends me pictures of eagles that she's
[1:46:38] seen here on the campground r.j last
[1:46:41] sunday sent me pictures of an eagle that
[1:46:43] was flying over the campground and he
[1:46:46] last sunday morning and he captured it
[1:46:48] close enough that you could see no doubt
[1:46:50] about it when you get that white head
[1:46:53] when you can see that white head you
[1:46:54] know what you've got
[1:46:56] somebody said you don't still get
[1:46:57] excited about an eagle flying over this
[1:47:03] in fact i got so thrilled about it in my
[1:47:05] spirit last sunday that when i pulled up
[1:47:07] on the campground one day for work and
[1:47:09] there was a bunch of crows sitting out
[1:47:10] there in the art
[1:47:13] i said why you
[1:47:14] god bless brother vermillion he's gone
[1:47:16] to heaven i can talk about the
[1:47:20] crows he used to call me and leave me a
[1:47:23] message every time i preached on crows
[1:47:26] and he'd say brother shelly you're
[1:47:27] mighty hard on crows he was an eccentric
[1:47:29] fellow but a precious brother he'd say
[1:47:31] your mighty heart on crows don't you
[1:47:33] know there has to be crows don't you
[1:47:35] know god created him and i said to him
[1:47:37] one time yes brother i love what crow
[1:47:40] whatever crow's function whatever their
[1:47:42] function is in the great circle of life
[1:47:44] i'm thankful for the crows i know god
[1:47:46] made them i know god couldn't make every
[1:47:48] every bird an eagle
[1:47:50] but he didn't call me to hang around
[1:47:52] with crows
[1:47:54] he called me to be where an eagle is
[1:47:57] he built me to be so when i pulled on
[1:47:59] the campground there was a whole flock
[1:48:01] of crows out there and i just said open
[1:48:04] my door and i said get out of here you
[1:48:07] don't discourage me
[1:48:09] i i know somewhere up there i may not
[1:48:12] see him but there's an eagle flying over
[1:48:15] this place you're not going to move in
[1:48:17] here on us you know how that crow
[1:48:19] behaves brother adam talked about the
[1:48:21] hypocrite nature of a crow
[1:48:25] and he mixes his diet all the time but
[1:48:28] not an eagle
[1:48:29] you know where i'm going
[1:48:31] so we read that that an eagle can soar
[1:48:33] uh he likes to fly at about ten thousand
[1:48:36] feet and he can maintain short bursts
[1:48:39] of fifteen thousand feet no other bird
[1:48:43] can soar so high
[1:48:46] you put another bird of sparrow or some
[1:48:48] other bird like that that high and he
[1:48:51] explodes
[1:48:53] he'll fall to the ground
[1:48:55] he was not created
[1:48:57] or designed for that kind of high flying
[1:49:01] their large wingspan
[1:49:03] and that that varies but but but can
[1:49:05] average it about seven feet i want you
[1:49:07] to know six to seven feet that's a
[1:49:09] that's a man's height
[1:49:11] so you lay down on the ground and that
[1:49:13] eagle can spread his wings that far and
[1:49:16] sometimes a little more than that so he
[1:49:18] doesn't have to do a lot of moving to
[1:49:20] them wings to get a long way in a hurry
[1:49:24] because that wing span
[1:49:27] allows him to glide and use very little
[1:49:30] energy to go where he's going did you
[1:49:32] know that uh that an eagle can soar for
[1:49:35] hours without ever flapping his wings at
[1:49:38] all
[1:49:40] he just sets his wings and the updrafts
[1:49:43] of the wind just catch underneath those
[1:49:46] specially built wings
[1:49:49] five primary feathers
[1:49:52] on each wingtip of an eagle
[1:49:55] and they are able
[1:49:56] by by an unusual joint in the wing they
[1:50:00] are able to circulate
[1:50:03] those five primary feather tips
[1:50:07] on the on the end or tips of their wings
[1:50:09] they are able to circulate that and it
[1:50:12] creates an updraft underneath their body
[1:50:15] and that's how an eagle
[1:50:17] draws his little ones up under him in a
[1:50:20] storm they are able to circulate like
[1:50:23] that creating a centrifugal force that
[1:50:26] if that little eagle gets too far away
[1:50:28] mama or daddy knows exactly what to do
[1:50:31] to pull that eagle didn't god say i bear
[1:50:34] you
[1:50:36] i took you out of that land of bondage
[1:50:39] and brought you over here to the promise
[1:50:41] with eagle's wings
[1:50:44] he knows how to pull us up under
[1:50:48] the great wings of that great jehovah
[1:50:50] eagle our papa who's watching over us
[1:50:55] built for that reason
[1:50:57] because god the designer knew that once
[1:51:00] those little eagles get to eaglets
[1:51:02] get to flying on their own they think
[1:51:04] they don't need mom and daddy anymore
[1:51:07] and they get a little little adventurous
[1:51:09] in the storm so god created a way for
[1:51:12] the parents to tend their little ones
[1:51:14] just suck them right back up under their
[1:51:16] chest and protect them from harm brother
[1:51:19] we have been given what we need to get
[1:51:22] right up under his everlasting wings and
[1:51:25] find our rest he draws us and if you
[1:51:28] want god to draw you here's the key if
[1:51:30] if we will the bible tells us if we draw
[1:51:33] nigh to him
[1:51:37] am i there if we draw nigh to him
[1:51:41] he will draw nigh unto us
[1:51:43] that's a promise that he has made
[1:51:47] in a message god's only provided place
[1:51:49] of worship paragraph 196 i hope you'll
[1:51:52] stay with me because i'm getting
[1:51:54] somewhere after a while
[1:51:56] paragraph 196 he said that's the same
[1:51:59] thing in the church
[1:52:03] they're trying to mix the denomination
[1:52:06] with the word
[1:52:13] to try to make the word say
[1:52:16] what the denomination
[1:52:19] says
[1:52:20] oh i hear that sometime
[1:52:23] i hear people saying to me that well
[1:52:25] that i know what it said but that's not
[1:52:26] what it meant
[1:52:28] well we've got a lot of divine
[1:52:29] interpreters of the word don't we
[1:52:31] i know what i read but it don't really
[1:52:33] mean that listen folks that's one way to
[1:52:35] get yourself in trouble
[1:52:38] this is a denominational spirit that
[1:52:41] gets on us sometime and they'll say well
[1:52:43] i think it's says that but it doesn't
[1:52:45] really mean that you know you mentioned
[1:52:47] something about uh the way that a woman
[1:52:49] should dress or do her hair or a man or
[1:52:52] something you mention these practical
[1:52:54] things and they say that that's not the
[1:52:57] church's place to talk about those
[1:52:59] things and i don't think that's what it
[1:53:01] really means and so forth but i want you
[1:53:04] to know the nature of that eagle it's
[1:53:06] not always trying to mix the word with
[1:53:08] some denominational creed or idea
[1:53:11] there's something a little bit more pure
[1:53:13] about the way that eagle operates he
[1:53:16] said they're trying to mix the
[1:53:17] denomination with the word try to make
[1:53:19] the word say what the denomination says
[1:53:21] and when you do that you have to spray
[1:53:23] them and baby them
[1:53:26] he's talking about hotbed plants and so
[1:53:29] forth those who are not high those who
[1:53:31] are hybrid instead of the original he
[1:53:34] said when you have do that you have to
[1:53:36] spray them and baby them and give them
[1:53:38] gold stars to come to sunday school
[1:53:44] i like it that brother brandon picked up
[1:53:46] on that
[1:53:49] pack of pews
[1:53:52] the church is still today i see it
[1:53:54] sometime in the news they
[1:53:55] they're going to give you a 50 i better
[1:53:58] not tell this some of you
[1:53:59] some of you will run to church over
[1:54:01] there and see if you can get you one
[1:54:03] they will say if you pack out three pews
[1:54:07] you're going to be uh registered to win
[1:54:10] a 52-inch flat screen television
[1:54:16] that's so much of the world isn't it
[1:54:19] that's like telling people if you come
[1:54:21] over here and help me build my church
[1:54:22] i'll help you get to hell
[1:54:26] by filling your life full of all the
[1:54:28] stuff you don't need to fill your life
[1:54:30] with anyway
[1:54:32] can anybody say man
[1:54:34] something is wrong with that picture
[1:54:36] we don't have time to mix the word with
[1:54:38] denominational ideas and give people
[1:54:41] little gold stars for coming to sunday
[1:54:43] school
[1:54:48] somebody said i just don't like it in
[1:54:49] church how people who don't do right get
[1:54:51] all the attention
[1:54:55] and we who do right all the time we
[1:54:57] don't ever get noticed they don't know
[1:54:58] whether we're here or there you know
[1:55:00] what that sounds like
[1:55:02] that sounds like a little preschooler
[1:55:04] waiting on their gold star come on you
[1:55:06] know that don't sound like a grown-up
[1:55:07] child of god
[1:55:09] give them ghost stars to come to sunday
[1:55:11] school and everything else he said
[1:55:13] that's right
[1:55:14] then he goes on
[1:55:20] is there more
[1:55:24] when a genuine born-again christian
[1:55:28] born with the word of god
[1:55:31] he's rugged
[1:55:33] he said he's rugged
[1:55:36] that's you
[1:55:38] did you know the prophet is calling the
[1:55:40] spiritual eagle rugged
[1:55:43] he's saying we don't get moved by things
[1:55:48] that move other birds
[1:55:50] we don't get blown away
[1:55:53] and troubled by things that others get
[1:55:56] troubled and blown away by
[1:55:58] he said that's you the lies and things
[1:56:00] of this world don't bother him he's an
[1:56:02] eagle
[1:56:03] [Music]
[1:56:04] he does what he flies oh i'm glad mostly
[1:56:07] southerners here you can understand this
[1:56:10] he flies plumb past it
[1:56:15] how many of you know he's not talking
[1:56:16] about fruit
[1:56:18] he's talking about getting up past
[1:56:21] all the little bothers
[1:56:24] all the little harassments
[1:56:27] of the enemy he soars into the heavenly
[1:56:30] see it's true
[1:56:32] it's true if you believe it's true say
[1:56:34] amen
[1:56:35] in the message it is the rising of the
[1:56:36] sun i have to get these out
[1:56:39] i'm under instructions this morning
[1:56:42] paragraph 263 he said we're tired of
[1:56:44] such stuff as that get back
[1:56:46] [Applause]
[1:56:47] your eagles
[1:56:50] back to the word of god
[1:56:52] he called us rugged while ago now he
[1:56:54] calls us burly i hope you sisters don't
[1:56:57] mind
[1:56:58] being called burly
[1:57:00] he's talking about being spiritually
[1:57:02] rugged he's talking about being
[1:57:05] spiritually burly be burly nothing oh
[1:57:09] hallelujah he's talking about being
[1:57:11] tough and strong and making up your mind
[1:57:14] that nothing is going to hurt you hinder
[1:57:16] you now you're just going to keep going
[1:57:18] he said nothing can hurt your feelings
[1:57:20] be burly
[1:57:23] we're not quite there
[1:57:29] this would be a good place to have some
[1:57:30] water
[1:57:32] let me see if i can get the hose here
[1:57:38] be burly
[1:57:41] we're not quite in that place where
[1:57:43] nothing can hurt our feelings but we're
[1:57:45] working on that
[1:57:48] and you know the way we work on that the
[1:57:50] most is to recognize that it's not what
[1:57:53] somebody says or thinks or does
[1:57:56] about us or toward us it's what he knows
[1:57:58] about us
[1:57:59] and if you want to hear what he knows
[1:58:01] about us here it is be burly
[1:58:04] nothing can hurt your feelings therefore
[1:58:07] you're free from all the scandal of man
[1:58:10] whatever anybody says against you that
[1:58:13] just brings oh
[1:58:17] it's a good place to skip
[1:58:21] that just brings more love
[1:58:24] when we could be those who wallow in our
[1:58:28] feelings
[1:58:29] he says use this as an opportunity to
[1:58:34] bring more love god let it be so in my
[1:58:37] life it's just quite honestly not often
[1:58:39] the case
[1:58:41] i want it to be the case
[1:58:43] i want it to be the norm
[1:58:46] when i feel a little bit hurt or put out
[1:58:49] i want god to help me come quickly back
[1:58:53] to more love
[1:58:55] realizing that if i make that kind of a
[1:58:59] stand
[1:59:00] nothing is going to be able to slow me
[1:59:02] down
[1:59:03] nothing is going to be able to tether me
[1:59:06] to this old world
[1:59:07] you're going to you're not going to get
[1:59:09] the
[1:59:10] the punchline if you don't help get
[1:59:11] there
[1:59:12] come on help me get there
[1:59:14] in the message countdown shreveport i
[1:59:16] know it's a lot of quoting i got some
[1:59:18] more too so i won't apologize the
[1:59:21] countdown shreveport
[1:59:23] 62
[1:59:24] i use this for the saints in ghana the
[1:59:27] spiritual astronaut
[1:59:30] is eagles
[1:59:32] he goes beyond all denominational creeds
[1:59:36] all denominational barriers all
[1:59:38] denominational thinkings
[1:59:41] all their cloudy thoughts
[1:59:43] he's above every cloud
[1:59:45] everything there is to look at he's up
[1:59:48] around the stars
[1:59:51] the astronaut
[1:59:53] and the astronaut believer
[1:59:56] is also up in the heavenlies
[2:00:04] can we catch the second part of that
[2:00:05] there i wanna i wanna there's one phrase
[2:00:08] i want them to see
[2:00:16] yes
[2:00:17] and the astronaut believer is also up in
[2:00:20] the heavenlies he's far
[2:00:23] beyond read this for me would you these
[2:00:31] every spirit
[2:00:33] in hell
[2:00:34] would like to tether you
[2:00:37] to this earth
[2:00:39] he would like to emphasize your sorrow
[2:00:43] he would like to emphasize your
[2:00:45] circumstance
[2:00:47] he would like to emphasize your hope
[2:00:50] deferred and how long you've been
[2:00:53] waiting on god to keep his promise in
[2:00:56] your life
[2:00:58] he would like to cause you to question
[2:01:01] everything that god has spoken to you
[2:01:04] through others
[2:01:06] and everything that god has spoken to
[2:01:09] you personally
[2:01:12] if he can keep you in the land of
[2:01:14] wondering
[2:01:16] if he can keep you in the position of
[2:01:18] wandering then he can keep you in a
[2:01:21] place of wandering
[2:01:24] because the more we wonder the more we
[2:01:26] wander
[2:01:28] and we often just wander around in
[2:01:31] circles
[2:01:33] killing time
[2:01:35] hoping for something better
[2:01:37] the something better you're looking for
[2:01:40] is above your head
[2:01:42] to access it we must remember who we are
[2:01:46] we must remember that it's not more
[2:01:49] flapping that's going to get us higher
[2:01:52] it's more trusting
[2:01:55] hello
[2:01:57] the eagle doesn't flap himself to higher
[2:02:00] places often he doesn't have to he can
[2:02:03] but often he just feels the wind
[2:02:07] sets his wings and allows the wind to
[2:02:11] carry him to a higher place
[2:02:14] where he can look and i'll tell you the
[2:02:15] higher you get the farther you can see
[2:02:18] huh
[2:02:20] the higher you get the farther you can
[2:02:22] see
[2:02:23] he's up high
[2:02:24] this astronaut believer
[2:02:26] he's in the outer space
[2:02:29] see the earthly man doesn't know very
[2:02:31] much about outer space but if the
[2:02:33] astronaut's in the outer space he's
[2:02:35] there with it so brother branham is
[2:02:37] typing the eagle and the astronaut the
[2:02:39] spiritual astronaut
[2:02:41] together and reminding us that whatever
[2:02:44] we wanted to use whatever analogy we can
[2:02:46] relate to the best we need to understand
[2:02:49] that the key is to get up above it
[2:02:51] and you've got a way there you don't
[2:02:53] have to work yourself there you've got
[2:02:55] to rest yourself there you've got to
[2:02:58] trust yourself there you've got to
[2:03:00] praise yourself there is anybody with me
[2:03:03] good good i'm so glad
[2:03:06] i'm glad you are
[2:03:07] because i want to move on
[2:03:10] we find out
[2:03:11] that that eagle builds his nest
[2:03:15] when it comes time to build his nest
[2:03:19] he's a great
[2:03:21] great
[2:03:22] defender
[2:03:24] he has equipment
[2:03:25] to defend himself
[2:03:28] he has very few enemies
[2:03:30] there are very few things the eagle's
[2:03:32] concerned about
[2:03:34] you've heard many times one of them is
[2:03:36] the snake
[2:03:38] so when he builds his nest
[2:03:40] he builds his nest high enough
[2:03:43] that he feels like he's above where the
[2:03:45] snakes are
[2:03:47] he gets up above the snake line
[2:03:50] and he laces that she excuse me
[2:03:52] lays her eggs there
[2:03:55] because she knows that they're safer
[2:03:58] there than anywhere else
[2:03:59] if you've got a nest to build i suggest
[2:04:02] you do the same if you've got a place to
[2:04:04] dwell or or you're looking for a refuge
[2:04:07] somewhere in the spirit i trust that you
[2:04:10] won't let it be on this earth or the
[2:04:12] plane of this life i pray you'll pick
[2:04:15] you out of place up above in the
[2:04:17] promises of god in those high places
[2:04:20] that we've been called to sit together
[2:04:23] in in christ jesus i pray that's where
[2:04:25] you'll make your your your nest
[2:04:28] your place to rest in the message as the
[2:04:30] eagle stirth up her nest brother branham
[2:04:33] says in paragraph 21 another thing about
[2:04:36] an eagle
[2:04:37] an eagle's a special bird because he
[2:04:39] will never build his nest on the ground
[2:04:41] he builds his nest way up high he likens
[2:04:43] that to his church you are a city that
[2:04:45] is set on a hill not in a valley can you
[2:04:48] say amen you're a city that's set on a
[2:04:50] hill that can be seen afar off a lighted
[2:04:53] candle it can be seen afar off the
[2:04:55] church setting up high with high
[2:04:58] expectations and high
[2:05:00] ambitions that what we have seen up
[2:05:03] until now is only a foretaste
[2:05:11] just a glimpse
[2:05:13] of what god has
[2:05:15] for those who dare to believe
[2:05:18] now an eagle is a fearless hunter did
[2:05:20] you know that
[2:05:21] the talons or claws on an eagle's toes
[2:05:24] are curved and razor sharp for catching
[2:05:27] and holding their prey the rough bumps
[2:05:29] on the eagles toes help them hold
[2:05:32] slippery wiggling prey like fish
[2:05:36] the long talons
[2:05:38] can inflict serious wounds to intruders
[2:05:42] i don't know if you've ever seen
[2:05:43] anything that's been pulled apart
[2:05:44] freshly by an eagle but it looks like
[2:05:47] it's been sliced up
[2:05:50] and that eagle does that with those
[2:05:52] sharp talons
[2:05:54] the diet consists mainly of fish but
[2:05:56] also waterfowl and small animals
[2:06:00] i know in the modern church there's some
[2:06:01] controversy about this uh
[2:06:04] scripture i want you to put up matthew
[2:06:06] 24 28
[2:06:08] because it happens to be a word in
[2:06:11] in greek
[2:06:12] that can be used for either an eagle a
[2:06:15] majestic bird or a buzzard
[2:06:18] a very low bird
[2:06:20] somebody said i don't think that's the
[2:06:22] right theme that we should use around
[2:06:24] the message since they they say that
[2:06:27] that greek word can also be used for a
[2:06:30] buzzard and i just tell them
[2:06:32] i don't have any problem i know exactly
[2:06:34] what this scripture means it's a
[2:06:36] spiritual word it's a prophetic word
[2:06:40] it's being fulfilled in our day it was
[2:06:42] fulfilled a generation ago it's being
[2:06:44] fulfilled in our day and i don't care if
[2:06:47] that same word has sometimes been used
[2:06:49] in context as a buzzard i don't think
[2:06:52] there's a more appropriate word than the
[2:06:54] translators chose here than eagle for
[2:06:58] wheresoever
[2:07:02] the carcass is
[2:07:05] there will be
[2:07:08] eagles
[2:07:09] be gathered together
[2:07:12] we're not talking about the rabbit
[2:07:15] we're not talking about the fish
[2:07:17] we're not talking about the dead possum
[2:07:20] we're talking about the body
[2:07:23] word of the lord jesus
[2:07:26] christ the bleeding word
[2:07:29] and where the bleeding word is there
[2:07:33] will the eagles be gathered together
[2:07:37] that word gathered the eagles a
[2:07:39] generation ago and that word is
[2:07:42] gathering eagles around the world in the
[2:07:45] hour that we live
[2:07:48] because they're finicky
[2:07:50] about what they eat
[2:07:52] the eagle is finicky
[2:07:55] now you'll often see pictures they like
[2:07:58] to show i don't know why they like to
[2:08:00] bring the eagle down so
[2:08:02] but you'll sometimes see the eagle
[2:08:06] sitting on a on a a prey
[2:08:09] it looks like it's been laying there for
[2:08:11] a long time
[2:08:12] and you do a little research on that and
[2:08:14] you'll find out that the eagle like any
[2:08:16] other animal like any other bird when it
[2:08:19] gets hungry enough
[2:08:25] it'll eat food
[2:08:27] whether it killed the food or not
[2:08:29] i'm so glad it doesn't have to be that
[2:08:31] way in this hour i'm glad i don't have
[2:08:33] to go into the denominational church to
[2:08:35] get a meal
[2:08:37] the brandon said if you did he said if
[2:08:39] you can't get a loaf you get a slice
[2:08:42] you know the difference i'm glad i'm not
[2:08:44] in a position that i have to go over
[2:08:46] there and spit seed
[2:08:49] i'm glad that i don't have to go into
[2:08:51] that system and look for bones all the
[2:08:53] time
[2:08:54] i'm glad that god has given me a place
[2:08:56] where i can hear his word
[2:08:59] and i don't have to worry about the
[2:09:00] mixture of this denominational system
[2:09:04] amen i'm glad that jesus that great
[2:09:07] slain carcass
[2:09:09] the body word of god
[2:09:12] is available to us
[2:09:15] we don't have to come into the four
[2:09:16] walls to get it do we
[2:09:18] it's available it's there
[2:09:21] in this message returning jubilee my
[2:09:23] gotta hurry
[2:09:25] when i put this together it just seemed
[2:09:26] like it'd just be so so so small to get
[2:09:29] it all but
[2:09:30] now i realize i'm not halfway done
[2:09:32] i may just skip here in a minute
[2:09:35] because i want to get to something that
[2:09:36] i believe is today
[2:09:38] you've heard it already but it's today
[2:09:40] it's today it's for today
[2:09:42] paragraph 63 of return in jubilee he
[2:09:46] said an eagle can go where no other bird
[2:09:48] can think of going
[2:09:50] if he'd try to follow him he'd
[2:09:51] disintegrate
[2:09:53] he's a special built bird yes indeed
[2:09:56] i will tell you a man that's born of the
[2:09:58] spirit of god is a special built man or
[2:10:00] woman hallelujah they're born with a
[2:10:02] spirit in them and knows how to act and
[2:10:05] to do and to be a son of god amen it's
[2:10:07] true you know that's the truth he said
[2:10:09] yes sir we don't have to have our women
[2:10:12] it used to be a shame for our women to
[2:10:14] cut their hair now if you're streaming
[2:10:16] this service don't get all bent out of
[2:10:19] shape
[2:10:24] like sister best said she used to do
[2:10:28] but i noticed her hair was looking
[2:10:29] lovely around her shoulders today
[2:10:33] don't get bent out of shape
[2:10:36] the word is the word is the word
[2:10:39] we're not here to condemn anybody
[2:10:42] if a woman wants to do her hair like a
[2:10:45] man
[2:10:47] look like a man confuse the genders
[2:10:50] that's on her
[2:10:52] we don't condemn her
[2:10:54] we don't question people when they come
[2:10:57] to worship with us
[2:10:59] we get asked all the time
[2:11:01] there was a woman here just a few weeks
[2:11:03] ago in a pair of slacks she stopped at
[2:11:05] the sound booth on her way in she said
[2:11:07] is it all right for me to come in here
[2:11:09] and worship like this you know what the
[2:11:11] young man told her of course it is you
[2:11:14] are more than welcome
[2:11:16] we have no condem this is how we worship
[2:11:19] our god this is what he's called us to
[2:11:21] do we're not here to condemn anybody
[2:11:23] else but i love what brother branham is
[2:11:25] saying here he's reminding them that
[2:11:28] this was at one time the standard of all
[2:11:31] the pentecostal churches
[2:11:37] and the baptist
[2:11:39] and the methodist
[2:11:45] he said
[2:11:46] you know the truth yes sir we our women
[2:11:48] it used to be a shame for our women to
[2:11:50] cut their hair he said they're doing it
[2:11:52] hello
[2:11:54] don't you get quiet
[2:11:56] they're doing it
[2:11:58] it used to be wrong for women to wear
[2:11:59] makeup they do it
[2:12:04] i'm not going to stay here i'm gonna
[2:12:06] move quickly past this but to me there's
[2:12:09] nothing worse
[2:12:10] than a former pentecostal
[2:12:13] because they don't even know how to put
[2:12:15] that stuff on
[2:12:21] somebody needs to tell them
[2:12:24] there's got to be a better way of
[2:12:26] applying it
[2:12:29] you notice they go from none
[2:12:35] to tammy
[2:12:38] there needs to be some help for them if
[2:12:40] they that's the way they're going to do
[2:12:42] it
[2:12:44] it's quiet in here
[2:12:46] i'm i'm at peace
[2:12:49] pentecostal he said i want went here not
[2:12:51] long ago to one of our famous
[2:12:52] pentecostal churches they knowed what
[2:12:54] was coming so i just go to preach the
[2:12:56] word and i've been preaching it every
[2:12:58] one of them got it went out almost
[2:13:02] that would be okay if i was somewhere
[2:13:03] preaching in a pentecostal church but
[2:13:05] i'm not
[2:13:07] i'm over here preaching to people who
[2:13:09] say they have the truth
[2:13:11] so you shouldn't be offended at a casual
[2:13:13] reminder
[2:13:15] that we're called to be different than
[2:13:17] this world around us
[2:13:19] oh yes they know that was coming all
[2:13:21] right they didn't have hardly enough to
[2:13:22] have a sunday school
[2:13:25] you get he just kind of cleaned it out
[2:13:26] for him they went
[2:13:28] bob there went bob-haired women and
[2:13:29] ricky's and elvises that's men by the
[2:13:31] way
[2:13:35] with bangs in their faces and beat neck
[2:13:37] clothes and
[2:13:38] and all of them taking off one way and
[2:13:40] this way and that way and with sonny's
[2:13:41] good i said that bunch of chickens
[2:13:45] oh it's quiet
[2:13:47] that bunch of chickens they can't stand
[2:13:49] good fresh meat that's right
[2:13:51] it's nothing but the truth
[2:13:54] the church would be running over here
[2:13:56] today if you look like the rest of the
[2:14:00] church world
[2:14:02] if we could accept what they have
[2:14:04] accepted then we would be more appealing
[2:14:07] to them
[2:14:09] but folks we understood a long time ago
[2:14:12] we're not building an organization
[2:14:15] we're not building a well-oiled business
[2:14:18] here
[2:14:19] we're building up believers
[2:14:22] reminding them that we are called to
[2:14:25] live above the ordinary
[2:14:28] [Applause]
[2:14:29] to give god all that he ask
[2:14:32] hallelujah
[2:14:34] without any bitterness in our hearts
[2:14:37] we need a holy ghost
[2:14:39] eagles eat
[2:14:44] they eat eagle food
[2:14:46] eagles don't live off creeds they live
[2:14:48] off the holy ghost
[2:14:50] they live off of christ
[2:14:52] god's real eagles there had to be
[2:14:56] there there had to be born special
[2:14:59] they weren't even created like like
[2:15:01] others around them now i want you to
[2:15:04] know that eagles eat eagle food
[2:15:07] but eagles don't eat other eagles
[2:15:12] this is where we have to pray more
[2:15:14] and apply god's word more
[2:15:17] because we have a tendency to consume
[2:15:20] one another in our in
[2:15:23] in our squeamish uh skirmishes or
[2:15:27] whatever it is that we go through
[2:15:28] sometime in family or in church
[2:15:31] we have this tendency
[2:15:33] to look at one another as an enemy
[2:15:35] almost we want to gobble them up
[2:15:37] so that there's nothing left but i want
[2:15:40] you to know that you can't do that i
[2:15:43] can't do that and get off the ground
[2:15:47] it's eagle food that takes us to higher
[2:15:49] places
[2:15:50] not eating one another
[2:15:52] if you can say amen please do
[2:15:55] now
[2:15:56] i don't know where
[2:15:58] skip skip skip skip skip
[2:16:02] revelation 4 7.
[2:16:06] and the first beast
[2:16:09] was like a lion
[2:16:11] and the second beast
[2:16:13] like a calf
[2:16:15] and the third beast
[2:16:17] had a face as a man
[2:16:19] and the fourth beast
[2:16:22] you read that for me
[2:16:25] it was like a flying eagle
[2:16:27] you find it a little bit out of the
[2:16:29] ordinary that john didn't say the first
[2:16:32] beast was like a roaring lion
[2:16:36] the second beast was like a moon cow
[2:16:40] the third beast
[2:16:42] was like a handsome man
[2:16:44] or a man doing manly things
[2:16:47] he didn't say anything about the lion
[2:16:50] the calf
[2:16:52] and the beast the third beast of man you
[2:16:54] didn't say anything about what they were
[2:16:56] doing
[2:16:57] what kind of
[2:16:58] action but when he looked at that fourth
[2:17:02] living creature
[2:17:03] which is the one that releases the
[2:17:05] anointing for the hour we're living in
[2:17:07] hallelujah
[2:17:09] it wasn't a roaring lion
[2:17:13] or a calling ox
[2:17:16] he said the fourth beast was like a
[2:17:20] flying eagle
[2:17:22] why wasn't an eagle just standing there
[2:17:24] what was it that caused john to look at
[2:17:27] that fourth living creature and say
[2:17:30] flying eagle i don't know exactly how
[2:17:33] john saw him all i know is my experience
[2:17:37] and in my experience everywhere he went
[2:17:41] his wings were stretched out even when
[2:17:44] he was walking on the earth
[2:17:48] even when he was not soaring i don't
[2:17:50] mean to get so spiritual that we lose
[2:17:52] some folks
[2:17:54] but i was standing here one time some
[2:17:56] years ago
[2:17:58] and god allowed a vision to open up of
[2:18:00] those four living creatures and i saw
[2:18:03] them walking and moving around in the
[2:18:06] spirit realm but it was as though it was
[2:18:09] right here on the platform i've had a
[2:18:11] couple more experiences with those four
[2:18:14] living creatures through the years and
[2:18:16] every time i saw the flying eagle his
[2:18:18] wings were always stretched like this
[2:18:22] even when he appeared that he was
[2:18:24] walking on the earth his wings were
[2:18:26] always stretched like this when john saw
[2:18:28] him he said he appeared as a flying
[2:18:31] eagle it's a message
[2:18:34] it's a symbolism to us
[2:18:36] come on now we cannot forget how to fly
[2:18:41] we cannot forget how to get above it oh
[2:18:46] we cannot forget how to set our wings
[2:18:50] we've got to be ready at any moment
[2:18:52] to catch the blowings
[2:18:54] and the movings of the spirit of god
[2:18:58] are you awake
[2:19:00] a few weeks ago the spirit began to
[2:19:02] breathe a little fresh
[2:19:04] on our services
[2:19:06] in worship and after the preaching he
[2:19:09] began to blow a little fresh and i saw
[2:19:12] some eagles in here
[2:19:14] getting their wings out
[2:19:17] preparing to catch the updraft
[2:19:20] of the spirit
[2:19:24] we saw that moving among us
[2:19:27] it's not that it has withdrawn
[2:19:30] it's just a little bit different maybe
[2:19:32] now i'll tell you i wouldn't i wouldn't
[2:19:34] trade anything for what i felt this
[2:19:36] morning when we were worshiping the lord
[2:19:39] i i don't want you to think in any way
[2:19:41] i'm diminishing what i felt what i
[2:19:43] experienced the movings of god
[2:19:47] the absence flows i'm feeling something
[2:19:49] now the abs and flows of his spirit that
[2:19:53] move i want you to know too many message
[2:19:55] believers have become rigid
[2:19:57] [Music]
[2:19:59] they call themselves eagles but they
[2:20:00] walk around with their wings to their
[2:20:02] side
[2:20:03] not that flying eagle
[2:20:05] no no no when i observed him in the
[2:20:07] spirit he had his wings out
[2:20:11] no matter what was going on
[2:20:13] he kept his wings out
[2:20:15] hear what i'm saying because he didn't
[2:20:17] ever know at one moment the wind might
[2:20:20] blow the spirit might move the will of
[2:20:24] god oh yes
[2:20:28] we get our roots down deep all right
[2:20:30] but sometimes it's not on the rock
[2:20:33] it's this attitude i will not be moved
[2:20:36] but i want you to know god wants to be
[2:20:37] able to move you
[2:20:39] whoo
[2:20:40] but brother shelly i had moved in a long
[2:20:42] time it don't matter it doesn't matter
[2:20:44] how long it's been since you've allowed
[2:20:47] the spirit to move you
[2:20:51] he's still god
[2:20:53] you're still an eagle
[2:20:58] if you were ever a son of god you were
[2:21:01] always a son of god
[2:21:06] your fellowship
[2:21:08] might change with him but who you are in
[2:21:12] relationship
[2:21:14] can never change
[2:21:16] come on
[2:21:17] if you ever were a son you are a son if
[2:21:19] you ever were a part of the bride did
[2:21:21] you know i've had people say to me
[2:21:23] through the years that leave church they
[2:21:25] go out and they say that bride life is
[2:21:27] just too hard for me
[2:21:28] so what do you think
[2:21:30] you think you can just go back
[2:21:32] into the systems of this world and and
[2:21:34] live and be happy
[2:21:38] i remember a man standing on my
[2:21:40] not on my porch but looking up at me
[2:21:43] standing on the porch and he said i
[2:21:45] don't want this years ago
[2:21:46] i don't want you to think for one minute
[2:21:48] brother shelly that we intend to change
[2:21:52] our standard of living
[2:21:55] just because we feel our time here is
[2:21:58] over doesn't mean that we have any
[2:22:00] intention my daughters are going to look
[2:22:03] you see us
[2:22:04] you'll see us looking just like we have
[2:22:06] looked while we worshipped here
[2:22:09] you see my wife
[2:22:11] you'll notice that she looks just we
[2:22:13] don't want to change our standard
[2:22:16] we have no intention of going back into
[2:22:18] the world
[2:22:22] yes
[2:22:25] but you see them now
[2:22:27] you see them a few weeks after being out
[2:22:29] from under this kind of an influence and
[2:22:30] inspiration
[2:22:33] you sit them down a few weeks in a
[2:22:34] denominational church where there is no
[2:22:36] standard and the next thing you know
[2:22:38] they forget
[2:22:40] who they are
[2:22:42] somebody said well they must have never
[2:22:44] believed that they just did it because
[2:22:45] the church did so far i don't know what
[2:22:47] all the reasons are but i know whatever
[2:22:51] you do to honor god you'll be blessed
[2:22:54] for it
[2:22:55] somebody said i never did understand why
[2:22:58] that was the way we do that you may
[2:22:59] never understand it
[2:23:01] but if you honor god by honoring the
[2:23:04] standard that he has set over this house
[2:23:07] you'll be blessed
[2:23:10] because of that you never go wrong
[2:23:13] people never intend but you get out in a
[2:23:15] different atmosphere and you forget who
[2:23:17] you are
[2:23:19] you let your wings drop
[2:23:21] i'm preaching
[2:23:22] keep them up folks keep your wings up
[2:23:24] i'm not just talking about praise i mean
[2:23:26] keep them set
[2:23:28] i fee i feel i feel a little wild
[2:23:32] in a good way
[2:23:34] i feel like i can't get out what i feel
[2:23:38] even describe what i feel but every time
[2:23:40] i
[2:23:41] throw out my arms i feel a little
[2:23:43] something getting behind my back i know
[2:23:45] it's not about feeling don't ever
[2:23:49] think that it's about feeling
[2:23:52] because there will be a time when you
[2:23:53] don't feel anything
[2:23:56] and if you don't feel anything you'll
[2:23:58] think god doesn't love you
[2:24:00] brother branham said what does feelings
[2:24:02] have to do with it
[2:24:03] so don't you ever live by feeling but
[2:24:06] don't you ever deny it if you feel him
[2:24:10] and don't you ever be ashamed that
[2:24:12] you're sensitive enough
[2:24:16] blow us lord
[2:24:18] blow us lord hallelujah let your wind
[2:24:22] come underneath our wings and raise us
[2:24:25] up
[2:24:29] paragraph 186 you'll have to skip down
[2:24:31] to it zoe because i was going to start
[2:24:33] early and i'm not i'm going to reserve
[2:24:35] my time i got to close
[2:24:37] 186 but in the last message that went
[2:24:40] forth it's uh easter seal
[2:24:43] but in that last message that went forth
[2:24:45] this is the last
[2:24:46] paragraph that started at one there we
[2:24:48] started at 182 i'm going to 186.
[2:24:53] but in the last message thank you that
[2:24:55] went forth there come a flying eagle
[2:24:57] it's eagle time reveal time the word of
[2:25:01] god made manifest the word of god proved
[2:25:04] or children walk into this baptism of
[2:25:06] the holy spirit come in and believe it
[2:25:09] with all your heart god will feel you
[2:25:14] i notice the comments that some people
[2:25:15] make on social media
[2:25:17] those who feel that they have moved
[2:25:19] [Music]
[2:25:20] you know beyond the message
[2:25:23] when it's clear to see that they're
[2:25:24] operating
[2:25:26] in some form of hyper judaism
[2:25:32] some some form of
[2:25:34] of trying to please god
[2:25:37] by pleasing the law
[2:25:40] i want you to know we are called to
[2:25:41] remember sabbath we are called to
[2:25:43] remember the feast of the lord we are
[2:25:46] called to remember what god has told us
[2:25:49] i was watching a little episode
[2:25:51] yesterday of the chosen some of you have
[2:25:53] seen that i was real late getting on the
[2:25:56] board the train
[2:25:58] then i had to binge
[2:26:00] to get it
[2:26:02] are there things you don't agree with
[2:26:04] always
[2:26:06] but are there things that bless you
[2:26:10] how many of you have seen the episode of
[2:26:12] the pool of bethesda let me see your
[2:26:14] hand i'm going to tell you something
[2:26:18] let me ask again some of you looking
[2:26:20] look folks
[2:26:22] don't be so spiritual
[2:26:25] that you miss an opportunity to see
[2:26:27] something that might bless your blesser
[2:26:30] let's see there's another there's
[2:26:31] another episode i saw that i wanted to
[2:26:34] mention the pool of bethesda and there
[2:26:35] was one just a few before that
[2:26:39] i wanted to make sure my family saw it
[2:26:41] together
[2:26:42] but that episode on the pool of bethesda
[2:26:44] i'm telling you
[2:26:46] that was really something now i've done
[2:26:47] lost my train of thought and why i even
[2:26:49] mentioned it in the first place
[2:26:51] there was something that was said in
[2:26:53] that
[2:26:54] oh what were we talking about
[2:26:57] i don't hear ye
[2:26:59] yeah
[2:27:00] yeah thank you so much
[2:27:03] i don't want to miss that
[2:27:05] because i understand the pool i've lived
[2:27:08] for for some time back and forth in the
[2:27:11] land of the bible
[2:27:12] i understand that pool
[2:27:14] but i want you to know
[2:27:17] we need the holy ghost
[2:27:20] and if when we think about holy ghost
[2:27:22] you think about jumping around that's
[2:27:23] your problem
[2:27:25] that's not all the holy ghost comes to
[2:27:27] do to cause us to jump around
[2:27:30] so i read some comments where people
[2:27:32] make you know they say it seems like
[2:27:34] they're always trying to pull us into
[2:27:35] something uh pull us into a higher place
[2:27:39] and all i want to say is been there done
[2:27:41] that got the t-shirt and kept on moving
[2:27:47] i love the fact that god works in his
[2:27:49] own calendar
[2:27:50] and he moves in these things i love
[2:27:53] these things
[2:27:55] but i don't love the religious spirit
[2:27:57] that it produces in some folks
[2:28:00] i don't love that
[2:28:02] i know sister joyce posted something
[2:28:04] about about a quote from brother branham
[2:28:06] about how we need the we do
[2:28:09] don't you be discouraged by any naysayer
[2:28:12] we need that
[2:28:15] we need that children we need that
[2:28:19] not just talking in tongues and running
[2:28:22] the island jumping around but we need
[2:28:25] the holy ghost to give us strength and
[2:28:29] power to live the overcomers life
[2:28:34] you think i want to go back to arguing
[2:28:37] over trimming the corners of my beard
[2:28:44] that would be like me going back to the
[2:28:45] assemblies of god and arguing with them
[2:28:48] about how long is long and how short is
[2:28:50] short
[2:28:51] i'll tell you what short time
[2:28:55] time is short we don't have time for
[2:28:58] religious arguments
[2:29:01] we need the holy ghost
[2:29:04] oh children walk into this baptism of
[2:29:06] the holy spirit come in and believe it
[2:29:09] with all your heart
[2:29:11] god
[2:29:12] will
[2:29:13] fill
[2:29:14] you
[2:29:16] don't get out of sorts i'm just telling
[2:29:17] you the truth
[2:29:19] i'm just telling you the truth
[2:29:21] now we need that flying eagle
[2:29:24] and we need eagle vision but i don't
[2:29:25] have time to talk about that let's get
[2:29:27] that let's get that tuesday night
[2:29:30] but here is what i wanna

[2:30:28] renewed
[2:30:31] like the eagles
[2:30:33] in the amplified
[2:30:35] it says this
[2:30:39] who satisfies your mouth your necessity
[2:30:42] and desire at your personal age and
[2:30:45] situation
[2:30:46] with good so that your youth renewed is
[2:30:50] like the eagle's strong
[2:30:52] overcoming
[2:30:54] soaring how many of you want something
[2:30:57] to be renewed in you
[2:30:59] so that you are once again soaring
[2:31:02] now i know this
[2:31:04] there has been controversy through the
[2:31:06] years about the eagles moping and
[2:31:09] molting period
[2:31:12] some scientists and those who study the
[2:31:15] birds
[2:31:16] say that it just is simply
[2:31:19] not accurate
[2:31:23] i however believe that in many cases it
[2:31:26] is
[2:31:28] and it happens
[2:31:30] i'm not going to bore you with some of
[2:31:32] my research that i pulled up and found
[2:31:33] today and and pulled over here into my
[2:31:36] notes i mean i already had it stored and
[2:31:38] ready but
[2:31:40] i won't read at all but clark's
[2:31:42] commentary some of you
[2:31:44] know who that is he said they shall
[2:31:46] mount up with wings as eagles they shall
[2:31:48] put forth fresh feathers
[2:31:51] like the molting eagle
[2:31:57] they shall put forth fresh
[2:31:59] feathers
[2:32:02] like the molting
[2:32:05] eagle
[2:32:06] he said it's been a common and popular
[2:32:08] opinion that the eagle lives and retains
[2:32:12] his vigor to a great age
[2:32:15] and that beyond the common lot of other
[2:32:17] birds he molts
[2:32:20] in his old age like
[2:32:24] and renews excuse me he molts in his old
[2:32:26] age and renews his feathers
[2:32:29] and with them
[2:32:31] his youth
[2:32:35] in the latin work of saint ambrose
[2:32:39] the translation of his thought is this
[2:32:41] the eagle lives to a very advanced age
[2:32:44] and in molting
[2:32:46] his youth
[2:32:48] is renewed with new
[2:32:50] feathers
[2:32:52] when i woke up this morning
[2:32:54] the lord asked me to sing that song for
[2:32:57] our visiting brother who i don't know
[2:33:00] he went on as i lay there a few moments
[2:33:03] he began to talk to my heart again and
[2:33:06] remind me
[2:33:07] of this period of molting
[2:33:11] where the eagle gets weary
[2:33:15] and worn out
[2:33:18] it happens to some in advanced age
[2:33:23] spiritually it can happen to those of us
[2:33:25] who have been serving the lord for a
[2:33:27] long period of time
[2:33:29] whether we're old or not
[2:33:32] there is an ancient rabbi whose name is
[2:33:34] sadius
[2:33:36] and this was what he wrote about the
[2:33:38] eagle and if you
[2:33:40] can make it this far please stay with me
[2:33:42] now put your heart and attention here
[2:33:45] for just a moment because i believe this
[2:33:46] is what this day is about it's about
[2:33:48] launching some of us
[2:33:52] into a place where we begin to see new
[2:33:54] feathers
[2:33:57] i hope that don't sound too weird
[2:34:00] where we begin to see new feathers
[2:34:02] forming in the place of old battered
[2:34:04] bloody torn worn out feathers
[2:34:09] we see god bringing some of us out of a
[2:34:12] mulching period and renewing our
[2:34:15] strength
[2:34:16] renewing our vim
[2:34:18] our vigor our anointing our passion
[2:34:23] to lift him up
[2:34:25] to exalt him not only with our lives our
[2:34:28] words but also with our lives
[2:34:32] the rabbi said this he said it doesn't
[2:34:34] have to be an in an old age
[2:34:37] his his observation was at every tenth
[2:34:40] year
[2:34:42] the eagle flies near the sun
[2:34:45] and when not able any longer to bear the
[2:34:47] burning heat that means he goes up as
[2:34:50] high as he can go
[2:34:52] she falls down into the sea
[2:34:56] and soon loses her feathers
[2:34:59] and thus
[2:35:01] renews
[2:35:02] her vigor
[2:35:04] this she does every tenth year
[2:35:07] till the hundredth
[2:35:09] when after she has ascended near the sun
[2:35:13] and fallen into the sea she rises no
[2:35:16] more
[2:35:18] how much proof
[2:35:20] do such stories require
[2:35:24] whether the notion of the eagles
[2:35:25] renewing his youth is in any degree well
[2:35:28] founded or not i need not inquire
[2:35:31] he said it is enough for a poet whether
[2:35:34] profane or sacred to have the authority
[2:35:36] of popular opinion to support an image
[2:35:39] introduced for illustration or for
[2:35:42] ornament so the rabbi is saying if you
[2:35:44] don't believe the eagle this happens to
[2:35:46] the eagle no problem
[2:35:49] this is my observation this is what i
[2:35:51] believe so i don't know how often it
[2:35:53] happens out there in the natural but i
[2:35:55] know that it happens very often in the
[2:35:57] spiritual because it's happened in my
[2:35:59] life
[2:36:01] the eagle gets weary he gets worn out he
[2:36:05] gets weighted down with the pressures of
[2:36:08] life
[2:36:10] a crust
[2:36:11] forms on his face
[2:36:14] and over his
[2:36:16] is be aquarius
[2:36:18] where he breathes
[2:36:21] it begins to crust over
[2:36:23] his feathers that once
[2:36:26] stood out and
[2:36:28] lay so beautifully arranged
[2:36:32] so beautiful and well oiled
[2:36:35] so that he could
[2:36:36] just shed all kinds of water
[2:36:39] anything he could go right down into the
[2:36:42] water take a fish and fly in the oil of
[2:36:45] those wings those feathers would just
[2:36:47] cause that water to go we used to shed
[2:36:49] things come on
[2:36:50] we used to shed things a whole lot
[2:36:52] easier back then
[2:36:54] in our life than we do now it seems the
[2:36:56] enemy are you with me seems the enemy
[2:36:59] wants to cause us to hold on to things
[2:37:00] and things to hold on to us
[2:37:07] the old preacher
[2:37:09] bobby thompson who preached these things
[2:37:11] about the eagle baptist preacher
[2:37:14] who preached these things about the
[2:37:15] eagle all over the country
[2:37:18] message people got a hold of it years
[2:37:21] back
[2:37:22] 30 years back
[2:37:24] because it's so related to the life that
[2:37:27] brother branham told us we had as eagles
[2:37:30] in his own personal testimony you you
[2:37:33] would have to question him
[2:37:35] but his own personal testimony was that
[2:37:38] he
[2:37:39] sat just outside of cherokee north
[2:37:41] carolina
[2:37:43] was taken there by a special cherokee
[2:37:46] friend
[2:37:47] and observed with binocular binoculars i
[2:37:50] don't know why i said it that way
[2:37:52] he observed for himself
[2:37:55] old eagles
[2:37:58] going through this molting period
[2:38:01] where they were down in the valley
[2:38:05] unable to fly
[2:38:08] no strength in their wings
[2:38:12] couldn't breathe properly because their
[2:38:14] beak
[2:38:16] crusted over
[2:38:19] bloody
[2:38:20] beaten bruise broken
[2:38:25] he said himself this is his testimony
[2:38:28] as he sat there with
[2:38:31] his indian friend and god
[2:38:36] he called his attention to the fact that
[2:38:38] here come eagles
[2:38:41] young strong hunting eagles
[2:38:46] who had taken fresh prey
[2:38:50] when an eagle gets down and out
[2:38:53] discouraged and broken
[2:38:55] in that molting period
[2:38:58] he can't kill for himself
[2:39:02] he can't dig
[2:39:04] for himself
[2:39:06] his talons are brittle
[2:39:09] and broken
[2:39:11] he couldn't catch a rabbit if a rabbit
[2:39:13] hopped around him in circles
[2:39:16] it's only a matter of time i've been
[2:39:18] there
[2:39:20] i've been there
[2:39:22] where you couldn't feed yourself
[2:39:25] didn't matter who was eating around you
[2:39:27] you couldn't feed yourself didn't matter
[2:39:29] how much of the word was available to
[2:39:31] you
[2:39:33] you couldn't feed yourself you felt
[2:39:35] ashamed of yourself because you couldn't
[2:39:38] eat
[2:39:40] you couldn't take in god's word and be
[2:39:42] renewed and strengthened by it
[2:39:45] you just couldn't do it
[2:39:48] it might have been in one of those
[2:39:49] periods of your life like i went through
[2:39:52] where i packed up all the tapes in a box
[2:39:56] put them up in the top of the closet and
[2:39:58] said there are just too many things i
[2:39:59] can't understand
[2:40:01] so i'll leave all those truths up there
[2:40:05] for another time
[2:40:07] and then you have god come by and say
[2:40:10] the second time
[2:40:12] in my life
[2:40:14] the answer to everything you need
[2:40:18] is found in that box up there
[2:40:21] that you put up on the shelf
[2:40:24] then if you're so dumb
[2:40:26] that you don't dig that out and let god
[2:40:29] use that word to feed you and sustain
[2:40:31] you
[2:40:32] you'll be like those old eagles down
[2:40:34] there in the bottom who refuse to eat
[2:40:36] and die
[2:40:38] don't ever be that way
[2:40:40] if god speaks to you and says your
[2:40:42] answers in a sermon you will find the
[2:40:44] sermon
[2:40:45] if god said i want to use somebody to
[2:40:46] speak to you you go find the somebody
[2:40:49] hello
[2:40:51] don't run from it run toward it
[2:40:54] with everything you've got
[2:40:56] but these old eagles couldn't hunt
[2:40:57] anymore they couldn't find their fresh
[2:40:59] prey anymore so so they hand him the
[2:41:02] binoculars and point out in the sky here
[2:41:04] are some younger eagles circling the sky
[2:41:08] they have darted down and caught a fresh
[2:41:11] rabbit are you listening
[2:41:14] taking up some fresh
[2:41:16] prey
[2:41:18] ripped it apart with those talons
[2:41:21] skinned it good
[2:41:23] because they understand the condition of
[2:41:25] those eagles
[2:41:27] down in that valley of death
[2:41:30] they know they're never going to have
[2:41:31] the strength to catch their own or to or
[2:41:34] or to take apart their own
[2:41:36] and so
[2:41:37] bobby thompson said with his own eyes he
[2:41:40] observed
[2:41:41] those young eagles swooping low
[2:41:44] over that valley
[2:41:46] he was they were pointed out at first he
[2:41:48] couldn't even recognize all the eagle
[2:41:49] there were so many of them there in that
[2:41:51] valley
[2:41:52] and he said he was told by the indians
[2:41:54] that that valley had been known for
[2:41:56] generations as a valley where eagles go
[2:42:00] to die
[2:42:03] he began to see how many there were
[2:42:05] there were quite a few
[2:42:07] and here come those sweeping eagles down
[2:42:10] over tops of their head dropping down
[2:42:14] rabbit flesh
[2:42:16] fresh meat
[2:42:19] spiritual food in due season
[2:42:24] and fools on purpose
[2:42:28] so those little eagles who couldn't kill
[2:42:30] for themselves or feed for themselves
[2:42:33] it was given to them
[2:42:35] i have had those eagles
[2:42:38] i have had those in my life that god
[2:42:41] used to fly over my life to drop down
[2:42:45] something that i could eat and remind
[2:42:48] myself that i was not ordained to die in
[2:42:53] that valley but then i was called to
[2:42:56] soar above everything
[2:42:59] how will i get up
[2:43:01] how will i get back
[2:43:04] bobby thompson said then the eagle then
[2:43:06] the indian tells him said
[2:43:09] look there across the hill almost even
[2:43:12] where we are
[2:43:14] and he zoomed in
[2:43:16] and he saw some eagles
[2:43:19] that were climbing
[2:43:21] out of that valley
[2:43:23] they didn't have the strength yet to fly
[2:43:25] out
[2:43:26] but the fresh meat had given them enough
[2:43:28] strict strength to climb out
[2:43:31] and he said they were using their wings
[2:43:33] like elbows
[2:43:36] i don't doubt it
[2:43:38] because when you get
[2:43:40] desperate enough
[2:43:43] when you get
[2:43:45] desperate enough
[2:43:47] you'll do everything within your power
[2:43:51] to get back to where you once had a
[2:43:54] birth
[2:43:56] come on
[2:43:58] you'll do everything
[2:44:01] within your power to get back to the
[2:44:04] rock
[2:44:05] from where you were born
[2:44:07] and that's what that eagle was doing
[2:44:09] he was headed him come on now
[2:44:11] i gotta stop but i gotta finish first he
[2:44:14] was getting back
[2:44:18] so he's getting more bloody
[2:44:21] he's getting more scarred
[2:44:24] more broken more wounded
[2:44:26] but he's got just enough strength
[2:44:29] and he's climbing up like we've sung
[2:44:30] here many times i'm climbing up the
[2:44:33] rough side of the mountain
[2:44:35] he realized i can't wait for somebody to
[2:44:40] take me back to the rock
[2:44:44] i can't wait on my friend
[2:44:46] i can't wait on my wife i can't wait on
[2:44:49] my children i can't wait on my pastor to
[2:44:52] get me back
[2:44:56] i've got to get back
[2:44:59] to the rock
[2:45:01] where i was born
[2:45:03] are you with me
[2:45:05] and so
[2:45:06] he makes it
[2:45:08] he makes it some do
[2:45:10] [Music]
[2:45:11] the bitter truth is some don't
[2:45:16] he makes it
[2:45:18] and the first thing he does
[2:45:20] is he lays his head
[2:45:22] against that rock and they tell us
[2:45:25] or they told him
[2:45:27] and i've read it a couple other places
[2:45:30] i've got several books back there on
[2:45:32] eagles where stories similar to this are
[2:45:34] told
[2:45:36] which makes me believe there's some
[2:45:37] truth to it
[2:45:39] that that eagle
[2:45:41] is looking for the rock where his mama
[2:45:44] had a nest
[2:45:48] he's trying to get back she's trying to
[2:45:50] get back
[2:45:52] to that high place
[2:45:54] most of you know that eagles mate for
[2:45:56] life
[2:45:58] and generally unless there's some change
[2:46:01] in the in the la lay of the land they
[2:46:04] nest in the same spot
[2:46:07] and so it's something they recognize
[2:46:09] and in most cases when mama doesn't mate
[2:46:12] and lay up eggs anymore
[2:46:14] one
[2:46:16] from that
[2:46:17] one of her
[2:46:19] children
[2:46:20] will go back and start building their
[2:46:22] nest there
[2:46:23] and laying their eggs there they're very
[2:46:26] very territorial type birds
[2:46:29] and so it's true that he's really trying
[2:46:32] to get back to the place where his
[2:46:34] mother once nursed him fed him and took
[2:46:37] care of him
[2:46:39] where he was born that rock jesus christ
[2:46:41] we all see the typology of that then he
[2:46:44] lays his
[2:46:46] head against that
[2:46:49] rock takes that beak
[2:46:52] and begins to scrape it on that rock
[2:46:56] back and forth back and forth
[2:46:59] he scrapes his beak on that rock
[2:47:03] one of the things that makes the eagle's
[2:47:05] vision so outstanding it's where its
[2:47:07] eyes are positioned on its head they're
[2:47:10] positioned on the side of its head
[2:47:13] if you look at the eagle you see how the
[2:47:15] face is shaped he's got an eye on one
[2:47:17] side and eye on the other side
[2:47:19] and that helps give him amazing
[2:47:22] peripheral vision
[2:47:24] and so you see he's having to cover up
[2:47:26] one eye to scrape that beak but he's
[2:47:28] scraping it on one side he's turning his
[2:47:30] head he's scraping it on another side
[2:47:33] because literally this old crusty
[2:47:36] deposit is taking his life
[2:47:40] it's choking out his breath
[2:47:43] it's seeking to kill him
[2:47:46] but all he has to do
[2:47:48] is scrape it on the rock
[2:47:51] you with me
[2:47:53] in a message letting off the pressure
[2:47:58] paragraph 40.
[2:48:01] skip down to paragraph 41.
[2:48:05] this certain kind of an eagle
[2:48:08] when he begins to get old he gets weary
[2:48:10] like all of us old people
[2:48:13] and he gets a crust over his head
[2:48:15] and he gets so weary he don't know what
[2:48:17] to do and now the bible said the eagle
[2:48:20] renews his youth
[2:48:24] so i studied about this fellow and when
[2:48:26] he gets old and weary and that crust all
[2:48:28] over his head he flies as high as he can
[2:48:30] go until he finds a great high rock and
[2:48:33] that's assuming that he's able to do so
[2:48:36] he sets down by the side of this rock
[2:48:39] and he sits there and beats his head on
[2:48:44] this
[2:48:45] rock
[2:48:47] instead of beating your brains out on
[2:48:49] the wall
[2:48:51] because you can't take any more pressure
[2:48:54] there's a way church
[2:48:57] there's a way little bride
[2:49:00] to let off the pressure
[2:49:03] and that is to beat your head
[2:49:06] [Music]
[2:49:08] scrape your beak
[2:49:10] on the rock
[2:49:13] till all that crust is gone
[2:49:17] he said beats his head on that rock what
[2:49:19] he's trying to do
[2:49:26] what he's trying to do
[2:49:28] beat the crust off all the crust and the
[2:49:30] blood will fly out of his head he goes
[2:49:33] through all kinds of torture but it's
[2:49:35] long oh listen
[2:49:37] i know i've wearied you out today but
[2:49:39] please hear this
[2:49:41] but as long as he can feel some of that
[2:49:43] crust on him he's got to get that off
[2:49:45] he'll run himself nearly crazy trying to
[2:49:47] beat himself nearly senseless trying to
[2:49:49] get every bit of that crust off so he
[2:49:51] beats it on the rock he just keeps
[2:49:52] beating it until all the crust is off
[2:49:55] his head and as soon as all of his crust
[2:49:58] is off his head though he's bleeding
[2:50:00] wounded he just screams
[2:50:06] to the top of his voice
[2:50:09] he lets off the pressure
[2:50:16] bobby thompson said that eagle
[2:50:19] he saw it scraping its beak on that rock
[2:50:22] and then he lay over lay roll over
[2:50:26] like an animal
[2:50:27] and begin to twist his head in a way you
[2:50:30] wouldn't imagine
[2:50:31] pulling out every bloody feather
[2:50:35] the only way to get a new one in
[2:50:38] was to get the old one out
[2:50:40] make any sense
[2:50:41] you heard these two sisters tell us
[2:50:43] today don't you hold that grudge
[2:50:45] or even preach it don't you hold on to
[2:50:47] that
[2:50:50] the only way to get a new feather in is
[2:50:51] to pull the old bloody one out and there
[2:50:53] he goes he goes to work
[2:50:55] he must look kind of silly
[2:50:57] when he's done
[2:50:59] have you ever had a dog you're proud of
[2:51:00] and then send him to the groomers and
[2:51:02] come back and you just
[2:51:09] you ain't much
[2:51:12] you trim all that fluff off and there
[2:51:14] ain't nothing left but a little noodle
[2:51:15] looking thing there in the middle nobody
[2:51:18] could love that
[2:51:20] but you
[2:51:22] just like a mama right
[2:51:23] right charity
[2:51:26] you
[2:51:27] cut all that off and you got this little
[2:51:29] skinny thing there left
[2:51:31] you just can't hardly wait for you
[2:51:32] couldn't hardly wait to get it all cut
[2:51:33] off you can't hardly wait for it all to
[2:51:35] grow back
[2:51:36] you may not can relate to that you can
[2:51:38] relate to a bad haircut brothers
[2:51:40] you ever had a bad one
[2:51:42] couldn't wait to get it all off couldn't
[2:51:44] wait to get it all back on you ever sat
[2:51:46] in the chair and considered asking him
[2:51:48] could you glue some of that back on the
[2:51:49] side of my head so i didn't look like i
[2:51:51] was fighting for my life
[2:51:55] he must look a sight
[2:51:58] he's beat his head on the rock and dilly
[2:52:01] and nearly silly now he's plucked out
[2:52:03] every bloody feather and there he sits
[2:52:06] with only part of his feathers
[2:52:10] but the only way he can grow new one is
[2:52:12] to get rid of the owens
[2:52:14] and the only way you can look renewed
[2:52:17] and look better and be a new creature
[2:52:19] strengthened and and starting over is to
[2:52:22] look like this this is part of the
[2:52:24] process you old beaten
[2:52:26] battered soldier of the cross
[2:52:31] you took lick after lick after lick
[2:52:34] and you have looked worse for the wear
[2:52:37] but your brighter day is ahead
[2:52:41] if you remember who you are
[2:52:45] if you get back to the rock
[2:52:48] where you were born
[2:52:51] pluck out every one of those old bloody
[2:52:53] feathers in bobby thompson said then he
[2:52:56] saw him taking their their talons
[2:53:01] scraping them on that old rock until the
[2:53:04] broken
[2:53:06] uh brittle tips would fall off
[2:53:11] the only way to grow new strong
[2:53:14] claws was to scrub off the old ones
[2:53:19] i find it amazing how these two men
[2:53:22] brother branham a prophet of god bobby
[2:53:24] thompson a independent baptist preacher
[2:53:28] describe these events so similar
[2:53:31] in the sense that bobby thompson you can
[2:53:33] hear it it's out there on the internet
[2:53:36] he said that eagle after he got all that
[2:53:39] done
[2:53:40] he made his way over to the edge of that
[2:53:42] rock
[2:53:43] he throwed up his head in the air
[2:53:46] and he said i was able to zoom in the
[2:53:48] indian said you got to zoom in close and
[2:53:51] he said i was able to zoom in and he
[2:53:52] said i myself saw the tears
[2:53:59] some sort of liquid secreted
[2:54:02] from the glands of that eagle's eye
[2:54:05] come running down his face
[2:54:08] and he preached about the
[2:54:10] cleansing power
[2:54:12] of tears of which we're all
[2:54:15] we all understand
[2:54:18] i saw this week of
[2:54:20] something going around on facebook
[2:54:23] that reminded me of the message that
[2:54:25] brother perry greene preached
[2:54:28] so many years ago the night of sister
[2:54:30] royale's horrible accident
[2:54:34] he was preaching that
[2:54:35] message that night on tears
[2:54:39] and how that the chemistry of tears is
[2:54:41] different
[2:54:42] related to the emotion
[2:54:45] that causes that tear and now science is
[2:54:48] advanced and i saw a comparison picture
[2:54:51] maybe you saw it too
[2:54:53] examining the different tears tears of
[2:54:56] sorrow tears of joy tears of laughter
[2:54:59] tears of pain
[2:55:01] and the molecular structure of those
[2:55:03] tears so different that it's very easy
[2:55:06] to distinguish the different tear
[2:55:09] and the different makeup of the tear
[2:55:11] because of the i believe it
[2:55:13] i believe that's how fearfully and
[2:55:14] wonderfully made we are
[2:55:17] i believe this is one of the reasons why
[2:55:18] we shut we shut our bodies down when we
[2:55:21] hold on to all these things instead of
[2:55:23] letting them out i tell you my mama used
[2:55:25] to tell me and her mother used to tell
[2:55:27] me before sometimes you just need a good
[2:55:29] cry
[2:55:31] men don't seem to relate to that as easy
[2:55:33] as a woman but i would just like to tell
[2:55:35] some of you brothers that that's exactly
[2:55:37] what we all need sometimes it's a leaky
[2:55:40] head
[2:55:42] we just need to let off the pressure
[2:55:46] brother richard and i we've got that
[2:55:47] down
[2:55:49] we can do that
[2:55:51] you may not understand it but it may be
[2:55:54] our only way of survival
[2:55:58] i'm standing in that studio friday
[2:56:01] greeting the saints in in arizona i'm as
[2:56:04] happy as i can be and i start choking up
[2:56:06] and the tears start coming and i can't
[2:56:09] even see them
[2:56:11] all i see is a camera standing in front
[2:56:13] of me but it was like i was standing in
[2:56:16] front of them and so sorry that i
[2:56:19] couldn't be there in person that i
[2:56:22] couldn't help the tears from coming oh
[2:56:24] god don't ever let us get so hard
[2:56:27] that we can't let off the pressure and
[2:56:29] bobby thompson said he saw that eagle
[2:56:31] after those tears flowed down his face
[2:56:33] said he went out to the to the end of
[2:56:35] that
[2:56:36] uh rock
[2:56:38] tilted his head up toward the sun and
[2:56:41] let out a ah
[2:56:50] i know that wasn't the best eagle call
[2:56:52] you've ever heard
[2:56:54] somewhere between a crow and whatever
[2:56:57] it's my best attempt
[2:57:05] what was he doing he was letting off the
[2:57:07] pressure
[2:57:09] what was he doing he was glorifying
[2:57:12] his creator for bringing him back to the
[2:57:15] rock
[2:57:20] yes
[2:57:22] hallelujah
[2:57:24] he goes on brother branham said why let
[2:57:26] off the pressure screams at the top of
[2:57:28] his voice why because as soon as all the
[2:57:30] crust is off musicians are coming
[2:57:32] then he renews his youth
[2:57:36] it's sure to come so as soon as all the
[2:57:38] crust is gone he can start screaming
[2:57:41] because he knows that he's got rid of
[2:57:44] god help us today oh god help us in this
[2:57:46] house today oh god help us in the
[2:57:48] nations of the world today oh god help
[2:57:51] every streamer today to get all the
[2:57:53] crust
[2:57:57] the residue
[2:58:00] of yesterday's trial
[2:58:03] heartache grief
[2:58:05] pain
[2:58:07] circumstance
[2:58:12] i
[2:58:14] felt a spirit of prophecy
[2:58:18] earlier in the service
[2:58:21] and i didn't yield to it at that moment
[2:58:24] not to be disobedient but to be
[2:58:26] appropriate
[2:58:28] and i heard god saying
[2:58:31] in the spirit to somebody i
[2:58:35] will
[2:58:36] restore
[2:58:38] saith the lord
[2:58:40] would you claim that i don't know
[2:58:42] particularly who it's for but i heard
[2:58:44] that vote i
[2:58:47] will
[2:58:48] restore
[2:58:51] my mind immediately went to the thief
[2:58:53] being caught in the act
[2:58:57] and i heard the voice of the spirit
[2:58:59] again
[2:59:00] calling out i
[2:59:02] will restore
[2:59:05] everything
[2:59:06] that has been stolen from your life
[2:59:17] stolen finances somebody said why do you
[2:59:19] mention that first it's the least
[2:59:21] important
[2:59:23] i didn't choose the order
[2:59:27] stolen finances because of broken
[2:59:30] promises
[2:59:32] and broken covenants
[2:59:35] and broken contracts
[2:59:39] i heard him say i
[2:59:41] will
[2:59:42] restore
[2:59:44] all
[2:59:44] that the enemy has stolen
[2:59:47] from you spiritually
[2:59:52] he's calling us back today
[2:59:54] as believers back to the rock
[2:59:58] where we beat our head
[3:00:00] against the solid rock
[3:00:02] and we scrape our
[3:00:04] beak until all of the
[3:00:07] crust is gone
[3:00:09] because he wants to restore
[3:00:15] i sensed in my spirit
[3:00:17] that the enemy had convinced some
[3:00:20] that you had come to the
[3:00:22] end there were precious promises that
[3:00:25] god had made to you along the way that
[3:00:27] you would never see the fulfillment of
[3:00:29] but i want to tell you in the name of
[3:00:31] the lord it's like the brown bear
[3:00:35] timing
[3:00:37] is everything
[3:00:41] someone said recently what's timing got
[3:00:44] to do with anything
[3:00:46] nothing for the unbeliever
[3:00:48] but for the believer
[3:00:50] timing is everything
[3:00:53] knowing god's will is only half the
[3:00:56] battle
[3:00:58] knowing what god wants to do is only
[3:01:00] half the battle
[3:01:02] but we've got to discern the timing and
[3:01:05] the truth is brother sister we've just
[3:01:07] got the timing off
[3:01:09] we've missed the timing
[3:01:14] no under this the fog blew in
[3:01:17] with me
[3:01:18] no wonder the fog blew in
[3:01:24] changed the hunting trip
[3:01:28] instead of brother branham going out and
[3:01:30] getting the brown bear
[3:01:33] the vision that was promised
[3:01:36] just passed
[3:01:38] right through him
[3:01:40] he said
[3:01:44] there are many people who have all kinds
[3:01:46] of ideas
[3:01:48] of how that will come to pass
[3:01:52] but i just take brother branham at his
[3:01:54] word
[3:01:56] he said it just passed
[3:01:58] through me
[3:01:58] [Music]
[3:02:00] because timing
[3:02:03] is everything
[3:02:05] i panicked this morning
[3:02:08] mary beth wherever she is
[3:02:10] not that sister laurel couldn't play
[3:02:14] she plays beautifully and she could have
[3:02:16] played eagle's wings beautifully
[3:02:19] but when i was
[3:02:21] asked to sing that song for our brother
[3:02:24] something dropped down in my heart that
[3:02:26] mary beth wants to play it
[3:02:29] and so i don't know why
[3:02:31] and so i sent
[3:02:33] uh benjamin or joshua one to come and
[3:02:35] let sister mary beth know
[3:02:38] that i wanted to play and she thanked us
[3:02:39] for the heads up and then when there was
[3:02:41] a little problem with the facebook
[3:02:43] stream i went to the back i saw her go
[3:02:45] out the door i assumed she had to go and
[3:02:46] grab something
[3:02:48] and i never saw her come back in
[3:02:51] and i knew by this
[3:02:53] experience this morning i don't know why
[3:02:57] you know what i don't have to know why
[3:02:59] i really have come that far i don't have
[3:03:02] to know why she had it doesn't matter
[3:03:04] but i didn't see her come back in and it
[3:03:06] worried me and i was feeling a little
[3:03:08] panicky even
[3:03:10] not because it couldn't go on
[3:03:13] we could have pulled it off
[3:03:15] but i wanted it to be exactly like the
[3:03:17] lord wanted it to be
[3:03:20] and so i sent joshua a no tonight
[3:03:22] because i think he's the one that went
[3:03:23] there and i said where is marabeth and a
[3:03:26] few minutes later he said she's sitting
[3:03:27] on the stair back here
[3:03:29] behind you waiting to play the song you
[3:03:31] asked her to play see
[3:03:33] timing i'm thinking
[3:03:37] where is she
[3:03:39] somebody go get her how are we gonna
[3:03:42] god's got everything
[3:03:45] we get all worried up for nothing
[3:03:48] if god inspires it he knows how to pull
[3:03:51] it off
[3:03:54] i feel led to tell somebody timing
[3:03:57] is everything
[3:03:59] i got to finish reading this it's two
[3:04:01] o'clock wow
[3:04:05] as soon as all of his crust is off his
[3:04:07] head though he's bleeding wounded
[3:04:09] he just screams to the top of his voice
[3:04:11] he lets off the pressure why
[3:04:13] because as soon as all that crust is off
[3:04:15] he renews his youth it's sure to come so
[3:04:18] as soon as all the crust is gone he can
[3:04:20] start screaming because he knows that
[3:04:23] he's got rid of all the crust go on
[3:04:25] would move to the next paragraph if you
[3:04:27] would
[3:04:33] but you know i
[3:04:35] i know a rock
[3:04:38] where that we can go and beat in prayer
[3:04:42] till all the crust of the world is beat
[3:04:44] away from us till all the unbelief of
[3:04:46] god's word is beat away till we enter
[3:04:49] into a place where all things are
[3:04:50] possible and as soon as we got all the
[3:04:52] world and unbelief in god's word beat
[3:04:54] off of us then we can scream and shout
[3:04:56] because eternal life is sure just as
[3:04:59] certain as anything certainly because
[3:05:02] all
[3:05:03] the world
[3:05:04] is beat off
[3:05:08] you got time for one more
[3:05:10] i don't know if i've got the strength to
[3:05:11] stand that long but we'll see
[3:05:14] paragraph 55
[3:05:16] as the eagle stirs her nest
[3:05:18] i want you to stand
[3:05:22] if you feel able please
[3:05:26] as an eagle renews his youth yes sir
[3:05:30] the revival
[3:05:32] takes
[3:05:34] and shakes
[3:05:36] all the old funny feelings
[3:05:40] away from you
[3:05:49] the revival takes and shakes
[3:05:54] all the old funny feelings away from you
[3:05:57] fly out
[3:05:59] into an atmosphere yonder
[3:06:03] likened his heritage to an eagle because
[3:06:05] the eagle renews his youth
[3:06:08] now makes him shout
[3:06:11] you watch the church
[3:06:13] listen you watch the church
[3:06:18] it'll be sitting all dry
[3:06:22] first thing you know the holy spirit
[3:06:25] strikes them
[3:06:27] their youth
[3:06:29] while the old people is just up on their
[3:06:31] feet jumping and shouting and praising
[3:06:35] god
[3:06:36] it renews their
[3:06:38] youth
[3:06:40] again he said that's right do anything a
[3:06:43] young person can do just jump holler
[3:06:45] scream and shout
[3:06:47] he renews his youth that's right i
[3:06:50] believe in that
[3:06:52] don't you
[3:06:53] i believe in that
[3:06:56] i believe in that don't you
[3:06:58] brother branham is saying what we all
[3:07:00] need is just a wave of that holy ghost
[3:07:03] revival to strike our hearts
[3:07:06] and we're positioning ourselves for such
[3:07:09] a move when we recognize that we've got
[3:07:12] to get back to
[3:07:14] that rock
[3:07:18] here we are lord jesus
[3:07:22] standing in your
[3:07:24] presence
[3:07:26] a bit of an unusual
[3:07:29] service
[3:07:32] bit of an unusual atmosphere
[3:07:36] yet we know ordained of you
[3:07:42] you started of the morning
[3:07:45] laying out a plan
[3:07:49] i can't make anything happen
[3:07:53] but i have been obedient to the best of
[3:07:55] my ability
[3:07:58] and now i'm asking that you would meet
[3:08:00] with each heart
[3:08:02] that you would confirm this word of
[3:08:05] promise
[3:08:06] to each one who stands in need of having
[3:08:10] their spiritual youth renewed
[3:08:15] oh god we know that you are able to
[3:08:17] renew our physical strength
[3:08:22] but we speak of spiritual strength
[3:08:27] to press on
[3:08:30] to hope again to believe again
[3:08:34] to have vision again
[3:08:38] our eyes have clouded over
[3:08:43] with the pressures of life
[3:08:47] we have watched our hopes and dreams be
[3:08:50] buried in the dirt
[3:08:55] portions of who we are have given up
[3:09:00] but there's something
[3:09:03] down in the inside of the eagle believer
[3:09:08] that can never give it all up
[3:09:12] it cries out
[3:09:16] for reality hallelujah
[3:09:21] it cries out for relationship
[3:09:26] for renewal
[3:09:30] to breathe better
[3:09:33] to see better
[3:09:35] to fly better
[3:09:39] lord bobby thompson told us that
[3:09:43] when that eagle gets his feathers back
[3:09:46] he lives up on that rock until
[3:09:48] everything's better and the first thing
[3:09:50] he does when he's through
[3:09:54] is he goes down through that valley of
[3:09:56] sailing
[3:09:59] catches a rabbit
[3:10:02] rips it apart in his sharpened talons
[3:10:06] and drops it down for those other
[3:10:09] struggling eagles
[3:10:11] left behind god's great cycle
[3:10:14] lord jesus
[3:10:17] there's nothing
[3:10:19] like a testimony
[3:10:21] of where god brought somebody back from
[3:10:25] to feed to inspire to encourage somebody
[3:10:30] else that if i can get out of that
[3:10:32] valley you can too if that man can beat
[3:10:35] his way back if that sister can get out
[3:10:38] of that place
[3:10:41] whoa
[3:10:44] then i can too
[3:10:48] help us lord
[3:10:51] just play something would you we're not
[3:10:53] leaving yet
[3:10:59] i'm not doing this
[3:11:03] with any motive in mind god knows me
[3:11:06] today
[3:11:09] he let me find this
[3:11:12] in my notes
[3:11:16] and i'm going to read it
[3:11:20] this was a note sent to me
[3:11:24] by a sister in this church
[3:11:27] who had been in our prayer meetings that
[3:11:29] we were having once a week
[3:11:31] this is a mom with children
[3:11:34] family
[3:11:37] a husband in the church
[3:11:43] she writes what i was trying to say in
[3:11:45] prayer meeting
[3:11:47] was that even though the enemy has
[3:11:50] hovered
[3:11:52] and flown over us
[3:11:55] trying to distract
[3:11:58] hinder
[3:11:59] and even harm
[3:12:01] the eagles are flying too
[3:12:05] and the mighty eagle is among us
[3:12:08] strong
[3:12:10] and powerful
[3:12:12] he is answering us
[3:12:14] and giving us wisdom
[3:12:16] we will continue to walk together in the
[3:12:19] prophetic
[3:12:21] and find grace and faith to do so no
[3:12:24] matter what the devil tries to throw at
[3:12:27] us
[3:12:28] the devil tried sending some major
[3:12:31] hindrances our way
[3:12:33] at this time last year
[3:12:35] which we are still dealing with today
[3:12:39] but we are moving forward
[3:12:42] and finding a new season
[3:12:45] this place has been a place of the
[3:12:47] prophetic
[3:12:49] the anointing and the word
[3:12:52] it's what has drawn many here
[3:12:55] it's still here
[3:12:57] and i believe it will increase and we
[3:13:00] will be able to discern the enemy's
[3:13:03] moves
[3:13:04] and attacks
[3:13:06] sooner
[3:13:07] and put him down
[3:13:09] sooner
[3:13:11] i know i have been in a battle since
[3:13:13] early last year
[3:13:15] but i feel so much grace and
[3:13:18] encouragement knowing he is moving
[3:13:21] and we
[3:13:23] are in him
[3:13:24] he will take us all the way if we keep
[3:13:29] yielding only to him
[3:13:32] and his word
[3:13:34] i won't read my response
[3:13:37] but i will read
[3:13:38] her final comment
[3:13:41] thank you for leading us all
[3:13:43] and praying for us
[3:13:46] we are overcomers
[3:13:48] and we are climbing mount zion
[3:13:51] to that completeness
[3:13:54] in him
[3:13:55] and i want you to hear this last phrase
[3:13:59] that mother's in this service today
[3:14:04] i want you to hear this last phrase she
[3:14:06] said thank you for leading us all in
[3:14:08] praying for us we are overcomers and
[3:14:10] climbing mount zion to that completeness
[3:14:12] in him i want you to listen to this last
[3:14:14] phrase she said it's
[3:14:17] why
[3:14:18] i
[3:14:19] was
[3:14:20] born
[3:14:25] why the lord let me find that it's never
[3:14:28] been read in church
[3:14:30] it was shared with me in a text
[3:14:34] why the lord let me find that this
[3:14:36] morning i don't even really fully
[3:14:39] understand but i want you to know i
[3:14:42] believe every word of it
[3:14:45] and i believe that it came from a heart
[3:14:48] that god was moving in and working in
[3:14:52] and desiring to bring up to that place
[3:14:55] of completeness and perfection in him
[3:15:00] that battle has greatly increased since
[3:15:04] that day but the truth remains the same
[3:15:09] we are overcomers
[3:15:13] by the blood of the lamb so my prayer
[3:15:16] today is that for this
[3:15:18] sister and for every one of us
[3:15:23] that we will keep our eyes on the lord
[3:15:31] find a way find a way brother
[3:15:35] find a way sister
[3:15:38] to get back to the rock
[3:15:41] where you were born again
[3:15:44] and don't allow the enemy
[3:15:48] to keep you from pressing the battle
[3:15:51] if nobody understands you
[3:15:54] if nobody gets you
[3:15:57] if nobody can help you on the journey
[3:16:01] you get a good old look at jesus christ
[3:16:04] and don't you turn your head to the
[3:16:06] right
[3:16:07] or to the left no matter what the enemy
[3:16:10] throws against you
[3:16:12] rise above it somebody

[3:37:15] we're so happy
[3:37:16] that you are here with us today we miss
[3:37:18] so many but we're so glad you're here
[3:37:21] what a great joy for brother steve and
[3:37:24] sister anita to be with us today it's
[3:37:25] just like a gift
[3:37:27] has been given to us and how we
[3:37:29] appreciate that
[3:37:31] and i don't want to start calling names
[3:37:33] but i because i know people make
[3:37:35] sacrifices all the time and we don't
[3:37:38] maybe think of it to mention it but
[3:37:40] i so appreciate josh and charity for
[3:37:43] coming all the way home from virginia
[3:37:45] yesterday so that they could be in the
[3:37:47] service today and help us
[3:37:50] i know many of you have done that many
[3:37:52] times and i appreciate that but also
[3:37:54] know how easy it is
[3:37:56] when you're that far away on a saturday
[3:37:58] just to say well we'll take another
[3:37:59] night and we'll travel home on sunday
[3:38:02] but we needed them here today and i'm so
[3:38:04] glad that they made that
[3:38:06] sacrifice our brother from florida what
[3:38:08] a what a great distance he has most
[3:38:11] likely come and we are very honored that
[3:38:13] he has
[3:38:14] done that i
[3:38:16] sort of tried to let him off the hook a
[3:38:18] little and i told him there'd be a lot
[3:38:20] of folks out
[3:38:22] and maybe he would wait want to wait to
[3:38:24] another time he said no i i made my
[3:38:26] plans and i'm coming and i'm so glad he
[3:38:28] did and i pray god is
[3:38:30] ministered to him in some way
[3:38:33] and uh let's see there was
[3:38:35] one other thing that came in my mind
[3:38:37] we'll be here tuesday night at seven
[3:38:39] o'clock and unless the lord speaks
[3:38:41] between now and tuesday night
[3:38:43] differently we will not be meeting here
[3:38:46] on friday night for a watch night
[3:38:48] service
[3:38:49] but you have the great grace of god in
[3:38:52] the freedom to gather together and to
[3:38:56] pray
[3:38:57] in your homes however god would lead you
[3:39:00] but i just
[3:39:02] just felt a little different leadership
[3:39:04] and i'm not sure what that is about it's
[3:39:05] happened that way before we want to be
[3:39:07] obedient to him
[3:39:10] but it's a wonderful thing we know that
[3:39:12] we are living by a
[3:39:14] bible calendar
[3:39:15] not a
[3:39:16] pope calendar
[3:39:18] but we also have watched how that god
[3:39:20] emphasizes things
[3:39:23] as the year changes i think it's people
[3:39:25] start looking for some change and when
[3:39:27] you look for change you can find it
[3:39:30] and uh
[3:39:32] everything that you have done for us we
[3:39:34] appreciate it so much
[3:39:36] there were some brothers who
[3:39:38] came yesterday to help
[3:39:41] benjamin
[3:39:42] [Music]
[3:39:43] prepare a place for he and his bride to
[3:39:45] live
[3:39:47] and
[3:39:47] they sacrificed their day these are
[3:39:50] really people who don't celebrate
[3:39:51] christmas or they wouldn't have took
[3:39:53] christmas day to come and lay flooring
[3:39:55] i'm not going to call their name because
[3:39:57] i don't want to do that and leave
[3:39:58] someone out but thank you so much for
[3:40:00] helping us
[3:40:02] i am not brother branham i'm not a not a
[3:40:04] messenger but like that but i know what
[3:40:06] he meant when he said
[3:40:08] if you love me then do something nice
[3:40:10] for my family
[3:40:11] i know what that makes you feel like and
[3:40:14] i appreciate that very much
[3:40:16] let's see what the lord has for us in
[3:40:18] this new season
[3:40:20] pray safety over those who
[3:40:23] travel
[3:40:24] god bring them back to us safely
[3:40:27] i hope that god has used brother greeley
[3:40:29] today and
[3:40:30] to bless his dad's congregation
[3:40:32] i always think about him when he's
[3:40:34] ministering there
[3:40:36] thank you for your patience today
[3:40:39] we're going to let you go in the name of
[3:40:40] the lord i i just
[3:40:42] i feel like something's a little
[3:40:44] unfinished but i can't find what it is
[3:40:45] so i'm just gonna
[3:40:47] i'm not gonna hold you while i decide
[3:40:50] and may god bless you as you slip out
[3:40:52] today in his wonderful oh i know i know
[3:40:54] what i wanted to say
[3:40:56] brother
[3:40:57] minkow and his family back there in the
[3:40:59] back
[3:41:01] they have been coming now for some time
[3:41:04] driving how far is it brother to for you
[3:41:07] to get here on a sunday
[3:41:10] because of where they're staying now
[3:41:12] they had to move out of their home
[3:41:13] because of
[3:41:14] the circumstances of the of mold etc
[3:41:18] some of you have dealt with that
[3:41:20] they're now staying temporary with our
[3:41:22] sister's mother i believe is right and
[3:41:24] it's two hours they've driven two hours
[3:41:27] to be here this morning they'll turn
[3:41:28] around and drive two hours back
[3:41:30] and they've been coming it's been a
[3:41:32] little over an hour from where they were
[3:41:33] staying i think before
[3:41:35] and i'm saying that to let you know that
[3:41:39] as long as they're abiding with us and
[3:41:41] worshiping with us they're part of us
[3:41:44] anything you can do to make their
[3:41:45] journey smoother
[3:41:48] they need a place to live they're
[3:41:50] they're asking about a place to live and
[3:41:53] nobody wants to stay with her
[3:41:55] mother-in-law too long i don't think as
[3:41:57] good as the mother-in-law might be he's
[3:41:58] really got his hand up he's right there
[3:42:00] even as even sister minko said that's
[3:42:03] just it's hard to find a house big
[3:42:05] enough for two folks two families like
[3:42:07] that
[3:42:08] but may god give them what they desire
[3:42:11] and if there's anything you can do if
[3:42:13] you can offer them a meal
[3:42:15] on that journey
[3:42:17] or if you felt led to press a
[3:42:21] gas money in their hand or anything like
[3:42:23] that well you just be obedient to the
[3:42:26] lord but i wanted you to know
[3:42:28] that i have not
