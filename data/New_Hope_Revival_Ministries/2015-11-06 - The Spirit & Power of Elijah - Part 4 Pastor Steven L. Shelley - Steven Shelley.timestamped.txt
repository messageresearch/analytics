[0:18] [Music]
[0:37] praise the Lord I'm Pastor Steph Shelly
[0:41] and you're watching the Eagle's cry I
[0:43] want to welcome you to the broadcast
[0:45] today and over the course of the last
[0:48] few weeks we have been studying the
[0:51] spirit and power of Elijah past present
[0:55] and future we believe that God has
[0:59] promised
[1:01] a resending of the spirit and power of
[1:04] Elijah multiple times throughout
[1:07] scripture and we're going to be talking
[1:10] more about our subject in just a few
[1:12] minutes I want to remind you that it is
[1:15] my honor and privilege to join with you
[1:17] in prayer over any prayer request that
[1:20] you might have and if you would like to
[1:22] contact us to share your prayer needs
[1:25] the information is given to you on the
[1:27] screen and it would be a delight to hear
[1:30] from you to know that you're there that
[1:32] you're watching and that you have enough
[1:34] confidence in us that you would give us
[1:37] that privilege of joining with you in
[1:39] faith and believing that God will meet
[1:41] your needs there's one thing that I know
[1:44] by experience and that is Jesus Christ
[1:47] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:50] he changes not if he ever healed the
[1:53] sick and my Bible tells me that he did
[1:57] then I believe that he still heals the
[2:00] sick today if he ever delivered the
[2:03] oppressed and the possessed and my Bible
[2:06] tells me that he did then I have to
[2:08] believe that he is just as able to bring
[2:11] deliverance and freedom and liberty
[2:13] today as he ever was he just simply does
[2:17] not change so whatever your needs are
[2:21] give them to the Lord and if you need
[2:23] some help if you need some prayer
[2:25] support then we would be more than happy
[2:27] to help you I'm coming to you today from
[2:30] the sanctuary of our church New Hope
[2:33] Revival ministries uh we are in a little
[2:36] Community called smiss Station Alabama
[2:39] and we just we just thank God over and
[2:43] over again for the opportunity that he's
[2:45] given us to be able to minister to you
[2:47] this way I want us to get right into to
[2:50] our study today and our theme for this
[2:54] study is found in the Book of Malachi
[2:58] and uh I I think think I'll just read
[3:00] that again and refresh your memory
[3:03] Malachi 4: 5 and 6 behold I will send
[3:08] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[3:11] of the great and Dreadful day of the
[3:13] Lord and he shall turn the heart of the
[3:16] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[3:19] the children to their fathers lest I
[3:22] come and smite the Earth with a curse
[3:27] and we've established thus far in this
[3:30] study uh that we believe on more than
[3:34] one occasion God has sent the spirit and
[3:38] power of Elijah into the Earth at a
[3:42] particular time when the Earth was
[3:46] positioned because of the rebellion of
[3:48] the people because of the uh leaving the
[3:51] faith you know the apostate condition of
[3:54] the Earth the need for a deliverer for a
[3:58] savior uh for an Awakening to to the
[4:01] Savior that had already come God sent
[4:04] the spirit and power of Elijah to
[4:06] prepare the hearts of the people to
[4:09] receive another installment of what God
[4:12] wanted to do in the earth we see that
[4:15] that anointing and and power was on
[4:18] Elijah the prophet then Elisha uh who
[4:22] who came after Elijah we find out from
[4:25] scripture and we'll look at that later
[4:27] that John the Baptist came in that same
[4:30] power same anointing Same Spirit it
[4:33] appears that uh a promise was made
[4:36] concerning the end time the end of the
[4:39] leodan church age where another
[4:42] installment of the spirit and power of
[4:44] Elijah was poured out into the Earth and
[4:46] it looks like we are being positioned
[4:49] with what's going on in the Earth right
[4:51] now and the Fulfillment of scripture
[4:53] before our eyes it looks like we are
[4:56] being positioned for another this time
[4:59] hope y a corporate pouring out of the
[5:02] spirit and power of Elijah upon the
[5:04] remnant bride of the Lord Jesus Christ
[5:08] and then the scriptures foretell even
[5:10] another installment perhaps a final
[5:13] installment that will take place in one
[5:16] of the two witnesses that are promised
[5:18] to preach in the streets of Jerusalem
[5:21] and we can you can read about that in
[5:24] Revelation 11 and also in the book of
[5:27] Zechariah these two promised Olive
[5:30] branches in order for us to be able to
[5:33] identify and understand the spirit and
[5:36] power of Elijah we uh feel like the best
[5:40] place to start is examining the life of
[5:43] the original Elijah we'll call it that
[5:45] way the prophet of the Bible the one
[5:48] that we read about in First Kings and
[5:50] and second Kings and so we were looking
[5:53] at his characteristics and number one we
[5:56] discovered that he was a Wilderness man
[5:59] he he did not uh despise that alone time
[6:03] that being separated unto the Lord so
[6:06] that he could quiet himself so that he
[6:09] could shut out some of the noise of the
[6:11] other voices around him and lean heavy
[6:15] into the Lord to hear the voice of the
[6:17] Lord to hear instruction and at times he
[6:20] appeared to others as a loner but uh it
[6:23] was it was necessary and God led him we
[6:27] studied in The Last Broadcast to the
[6:29] brook cherith which is separated it
[6:31] means separated and when that uh I want
[6:34] to say that uh uh episode of his life
[6:38] that portion of his life was fulfilled
[6:40] he moved on to the Widow of zarap and we
[6:44] talked about how God made provision for
[6:46] him there and so number one Elijah of
[6:50] the Bible was a Wilderness man and then
[6:53] as we were leaving the broadcast last
[6:55] week we mentioned the second
[6:57] characteristic of the prophet Elijah and
[7:00] that was that he preached without fear
[7:03] against the religious order and the
[7:06] spiritual Norm of his day to call the
[7:10] people back to the faith and I want to
[7:13] give you an example of that that is
[7:15] found in the scripture in the book of
[7:18] First Kings if you have your Bible there
[7:20] you can uh look at it with me or maybe
[7:24] jot it down and look at it at a later
[7:26] time but it is First Kings 8 18
[7:30] beginning in verse 21 it reads and
[7:34] Elijah came unto all the people and said
[7:37] how long halt ye between two opinions if
[7:42] the Lord be God follow him but if bael
[7:46] then follow him and the people answered
[7:49] him not a word we see on Elijah the
[7:54] courage to confront the courage to stand
[7:58] and say that the normal attitude lack of
[8:02] real commitment of his generation uh was
[8:06] not enough he said I want to challenge
[8:08] you in this you you've got two opinions
[8:10] you're holding on to God with one hand
[8:13] and bael which is a false god in the
[8:15] other hand you have become very
[8:18] non-committed in your faith and and I'm
[8:20] here to tell you it's time to make up
[8:23] your mind and the people it seems had no
[8:26] answer for him in verse 22 then said
[8:29] Elijah unto the people I even I only
[8:33] remain a prophet of the Lord but by else
[8:35] prophets are 450 Men Let Them therefore
[8:39] give us two Bullocks let them choose one
[8:42] bulock for themselves cut it in pieces
[8:44] lay it on wood put no fire under I will
[8:48] dress the other bullet lay it on wood
[8:50] put no fire under and call ye on the
[8:53] name of your gods and I will call on the
[8:57] name of the Lord and the God that anth
[9:00] by fire let him be God and all the
[9:04] people answered and said it is well
[9:07] spoken they agreed with his Challenge on
[9:10] Mount Carmel and Elijah said unto the
[9:13] prophets of Baal go ahead giving them
[9:16] the instructions what to do choose this
[9:17] one and so forth and they did that they
[9:21] took the Bullock uh and they dressed it
[9:24] laid it out called on the name of bael
[9:28] the Bible said in verse 26 from morning
[9:31] all the way until noon oh bael hear us
[9:35] but there was no voice nor anyone that
[9:38] answered and they leaped upon the altar
[9:41] which was made and it came to pass at
[9:43] noon verse 27 that Elijah mocked them
[9:47] and said cry aloud for he is a God
[9:49] either he is talking or is pursuing or
[9:52] is on a journey or per Adventure he
[9:55] sleepeth and must be awake and they
[9:58] cried aloud in their desperation to get
[10:01] an answer to manipulate their God who
[10:05] was not uh in order to manipulate him
[10:08] they cut themselves with all manner of
[10:11] knives and lancets verse 28 said Till
[10:14] The Blood gushed Out upon them verse 29
[10:17] it came to pass when midday was passed
[10:20] they they prophesied until the time of
[10:23] the offering of the evening sacrifice
[10:25] and there was neither voice nor any to
[10:28] answer nor any of that regarded so all
[10:31] of their uh manipulation all of their
[10:34] tactics to try to persuade their God now
[10:37] this tells me that they believed they
[10:39] really believed their God was real they
[10:41] would have never cut themselves if they
[10:43] didn't think that the god that they they
[10:46] served was a real God they were
[10:48] absolutely deceived but no voice and
[10:51] when when Elijah began to mock the fact
[10:53] that their God wasn't answering it
[10:55] really drove them into desperation
[10:57] they're jumping around and pleading
[10:59] and yet there is no answer and when
[11:02] Elijah had had just about all of it that
[11:04] he could have the Bible said he took 12
[11:07] Stones according to the number of the
[11:08] sons of Jacob and with the stones he
[11:11] built an altar in the name of the Lord
[11:14] he made a trench about the altar a as
[11:17] great as would contain two measures of
[11:19] seed he put the wood in order he cut the
[11:22] bulock in pieces laid it on the wood and
[11:25] said fill four barrels with water now
[11:28] he's going Beyond The Challenge and pour
[11:32] it on the sacrifice and on the wood and
[11:34] he said do it a second time and they did
[11:36] it do it a third time and they did it
[11:39] and the water ran about the Altar and he
[11:42] filled the trench also with water and it
[11:45] came to pass at the time of the offering
[11:47] of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the
[11:50] prophet came near and said let me read
[11:53] it read his prayer Lord God of Abraham
[11:57] Isaac and of Israel
[12:00] let it be known this day that thou art
[12:04] God in Israel and that I am your servant
[12:07] and that I have done all these things at
[12:10] Thy word help me oh Lord hear me that
[12:14] this people may know that thou art the
[12:17] Lord God and that thou has turned their
[12:21] heart back again now this is where
[12:25] Malachi's prophecy is tied in with the
[12:29] Ministry of the original Elijah Prophet
[12:32] that's it's the same phraseology here
[12:35] turn their heart back again this was
[12:39] part of Elijah's prayer it's part of the
[12:41] Elijah commission to turn Hearts back to
[12:46] the original faith and I want you to
[12:48] know what verse 38 said then the fire of
[12:52] the Lord fell and consumed the burnt
[12:56] sacrifice and the wood and and the
[13:00] stones now this is not just ordinary
[13:02] fire is it this fire burned the
[13:06] sacrifice the wood the stones the dust
[13:10] and licked up the water that was in the
[13:12] trench and when all the people saw it
[13:15] they fell on their faces and they said
[13:19] the Lord he is the god the Lord he is
[13:25] the god and Elijah said unto them take
[13:28] the prophets of ba
[13:29] and let not one of them escape and they
[13:32] took them and Elijah brought them down
[13:34] to the brook Kishon and slew them there
[13:37] what a mighty Showdown the power of God
[13:42] contrasted with the power of a God that
[13:46] doesn't exist well that is a no-brainer
[13:50] I I if this God doesn't exist then he
[13:52] has no power has no ability to help and
[13:56] yet many people would have continued to
[13:58] fall Follow by L and even in the world
[14:01] that we live in today many men and women
[14:04] are worshiping powerless gods that do
[14:07] not exist the only place where these
[14:10] gods exist is in the imagination of
[14:13] men's Hearts there is no reality but I'm
[14:17] talking to you today about God about
[14:20] Jehovah the Living God the god of
[14:22] Creation The God Who Loved Us so much
[14:26] that he came to this earth in human
[14:28] flesh to bleed to die to suffer to
[14:32] become our sacrifice our propitiation
[14:36] for sin our complete reconciliation and
[14:39] Redemption to God was provided through
[14:42] the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[14:45] so it is impossible for you and I to
[14:47] hold on to the Living God the true God
[14:51] and the false gods of men's
[14:54] imaginations we need to come clean
[14:57] separate ourselves from all all paganism
[15:00] separate ourselves from all idolatry and
[15:03] I know that what I'm preaching to you uh
[15:06] from my little safe place seemingly in
[15:10] Smith Station Alabama but yet I'm
[15:12] preaching around the world into Nations
[15:15] and cultures where to stand for the true
[15:18] Living God can bring persecution and in
[15:21] some cases even death but I want you to
[15:25] know there is no other way to God other
[15:29] than the Lord Jesus Christ on the Last
[15:31] Broadcast we talked about him saying I
[15:35] am the way the truth and the life he is
[15:38] the door the window whereby we enter
[15:41] into fellowship with God and so Elijah
[15:45] called uh challenged the religious Norm
[15:49] of his day he challenged false religion
[15:53] he said you're just this is phony uh
[15:56] this is not real this is not authentic
[15:59] and it's time to make up your mind you
[16:02] know some people follow in Tradition
[16:05] because they don't want to offend their
[16:06] family or their neighbors and yet Elijah
[16:09] said you can't just keep doing nothing
[16:12] because you don't want to make a stand
[16:14] how long halt you between two opinions
[16:18] and so if this characteristic of Elijah
[16:21] the prophet If This truly was uh an
[16:25] attribute a characteristic of his
[16:27] ministry and and I've just shown you in
[16:29] the word where it was then if that
[16:31] spirit and power of Elijah return to the
[16:34] Earth and they have each time they come
[16:38] they would come with the same kind of
[16:40] message a message to call people into
[16:43] separation into intimacy what we have
[16:47] called the Wilderness and number two to
[16:50] challenge the the false religion of the
[16:53] day and also the religious Norm the the
[16:58] nor form of religion today is just cool
[17:02] watered down Christianity and so there's
[17:05] two things that Elijah addressed he
[17:08] addressed the fact that people were
[17:10] following false gods and he addressed
[17:13] that people had ered from the original
[17:16] Faith the faith that was given to Moses
[17:19] you've aired from that you've gone in
[17:21] another Direction and it's time for you
[17:24] to be challenged and to make up your
[17:26] mind where you stand there was neither
[17:30] slackness nor complacency in Elijah and
[17:34] if there should come a company of people
[17:37] Anointed with the spirit and power of
[17:40] Elijah they too will not be a complacent
[17:44] people they will not be a lukewarm
[17:47] people they'll be a people of boldness
[17:50] they will be a people of Courage they
[17:52] will be a people of of non-c compromise
[17:56] calling people back to the faith that
[17:59] was once delivered to the Saints as the
[18:02] New Testament says earnestly contending
[18:05] for the faith sometimes there's a battle
[18:08] because we have to make a stand I love
[18:11] the fact that Elijah risked his life he
[18:14] he really uh was not afraid to confront
[18:19] and to call the people back he burned
[18:22] with a holy passion it's time for there
[18:25] to be men and women among us who are
[18:28] filled f with a holy passion for God a
[18:32] Zeal for righteousness he was an altar
[18:36] Builder did you notice that he built his
[18:39] own altar he didn't just try to use the
[18:41] altar that had already been prepared he
[18:44] built his own altar with great concern
[18:48] for its significance he he took 12
[18:51] Stones because he was representing the
[18:54] 12 tribes of Israel so what he was doing
[18:58] even even building an altar had more uh
[19:02] significance and more meaning than just
[19:04] a place to pray or a place to offer
[19:07] sacrifice it became a prophetic
[19:10] declaration that the god of Israel and
[19:14] the god of the sons of Israel is still
[19:16] alive and he built this altar we could
[19:20] almost say uh as a memorial to the
[19:23] promise to the Covenant that God had
[19:25] made with Abraham Isaac Jacob who who uh
[19:29] now has become Israel and his sons this
[19:33] was a real uh I I call it going back to
[19:37] the old landmarks like the Bible talks
[19:39] about he wanted to
[19:42] reestablish uh the foundation of the
[19:45] faith and he did that by laying those 12
[19:48] Stones on the altar so any uh time that
[19:52] the spirit and power of Elijah should
[19:55] visit the Earth we will recognize that
[19:59] by this desire to stand on the
[20:03] uncompromised word of God and a desire
[20:06] to be an altar Builder a worshipper uh a
[20:10] prayer Warrior as we have called it this
[20:13] Elijah was not intimidated by the other
[20:16] religious demonstrations of those around
[20:19] him uh he just mocked it to be honest
[20:22] with you uh he just said where is your
[20:25] god is he on vacation I is he talking
[20:29] with his neighbor why is it that he is
[20:31] ignoring you he just had a little fun
[20:34] and and did it to offend their minds so
[20:37] that they could begin to see the reality
[20:40] that what they were giving their lives
[20:42] for was fallacy it was false it was a
[20:46] fable and so all of their praying
[20:49] prophesying they prophesied through the
[20:51] afternoon jumped up on the altar jumped
[20:54] around danced around cut themselves n
[20:58] none of that moved Elijah not at all
[21:02] just go right ahead and do whatever you
[21:05] have to do to make yourself comfortable
[21:08] because at the end of this he stepped up
[21:11] with full confidence that his God was
[21:16] going to prove himself to be genuine and
[21:19] to be real I sit here today with full
[21:24] confidence that my God is going to show
[21:28] himself strong and mighty in the earth
[21:32] not only today but tomorrow throughout
[21:36] all eternity and when they had
[21:38] demonstrated their faith or uh false as
[21:41] it was he stepped up with confidence in
[21:45] the God that he served and prayed I
[21:48] believe it was 63
[21:50] words not hours of prayer not not all
[21:55] this you know demonstration cutting and
[21:57] using LAN and jump on the Altar and all
[22:00] this stuff he just prayed 63 little
[22:03] words he reminded God I know who you are
[22:07] I know the Covenant that you have made
[22:09] with your people and he added to the
[22:12] challenge he he just said I'm going to
[22:15] do more I'm going to dig a trench I'm
[22:19] going to have water poured on the altar
[22:21] three times big buckets of water and
[22:25] prayed his little prayer stepped back
[22:27] and the god that Elijah trusted in moved
[22:31] in and answered by fire and we showed
[22:34] you right in the word of God where the
[22:36] fire not only burned up the bulock and
[22:39] the wood but even licked up the dust
[22:42] licked up the water caused the water to
[22:45] evaporate to disappear and even consume
[22:48] the stones I'm telling you this was a
[22:51] demonstration uh of the realness of our
[22:53] God wasn't it and uh that is an
[22:57] outstanding demon demonstration uh
[23:00] contrasting that which is genuine and
[23:02] that which is false maybe every time
[23:05] there's such a showdown the results
[23:07] might not be as dramatic but every time
[23:11] God is challenged and compared with the
[23:14] gods of men's imaginations I promise you
[23:17] the god of the Bible is going to come
[23:20] out on top every time and he changes not
[23:25] uh another thing to notice about Elijah
[23:28] he was not afraid to challenge when he
[23:30] needed to challenge and to confront when
[23:34] necessary something you ought to know
[23:36] about this bael this false god he was
[23:40] called in the traditions of men a cloud
[23:45] Rider it means that he was the god of
[23:48] weather and it was supposed to be up to
[23:51] bael to change the seasons when it was
[23:55] to be spring when it was to be summer
[23:57] when it was to be Autumn when it was to
[24:00] be winter it was up to bael and it was
[24:03] believed that bael controlled the rain
[24:06] and and therefore that made him a god of
[24:09] water a god of weather and so I I feel
[24:14] that this little extra challenge with
[24:16] the water was addressing that issue it
[24:20] was a real Smackdown of bael in the eyes
[24:25] of those who had trusted so blindly in
[24:29] his ability and in his power and and in
[24:33] that day his inability was exposed in
[24:37] fact his non-existence was exposed I
[24:41] believe that if indeed we see a return
[24:46] of the spirit and power of Elijah in our
[24:49] day we will see showdowns in the earth
[24:53] and uh sure enough they're needed where
[24:56] the power of God is on display showing
[25:01] men and women that what they have
[25:02] trusted in what they have believed in
[25:05] what many have laid down their lives for
[25:09] uh that is in often cases merely the the
[25:13] traditions of Men passed down from
[25:16] generation to generation with no power
[25:19] in it with no life in it but I want you
[25:22] to know the god of the Bible Jehovah God
[25:25] he did more than just rule from the
[25:27] heavens
[25:29] he came in flesh he paid the price he
[25:32] became our uh our our propitiation for
[25:36] sin the Bible said but I want you to
[25:39] know the Bible also tells us he was
[25:41] tempted in all manner as we are yet
[25:44] without sin he was the great high priest
[25:48] and yet he came and walked among men
[25:51] facing all of The Temptations all of the
[25:54] trials of common men and yet he did not
[25:57] sin
[25:58] this was a testimony to me it is a
[26:02] testimony to me that if my Lord could
[26:06] overcome I can overcome also by trusting
[26:10] in his power and his strength little
[26:12] children he said I have overcome the
[26:14] world and you can overcome the world too
[26:17] if you put your trust in the one who has
[26:20] already overcome the world our Lord
[26:23] Jesus Christ so you know there may come
[26:26] a time I think it will
[26:28] most definitely where we have to stand
[26:31] and it may not be easy because the world
[26:34] will challenge us mock us you know deny
[26:37] that Jesus is real Yeshua that he is
[26:40] really the Messiah but if you have this
[26:43] revelation of Faith you stand you stand
[26:48] don't be afraid to stand on the word if
[26:50] you stand for God I assure you he'll
[26:53] stand for you I want us to pray because
[26:56] I know there are needs out there and and
[26:58] I know this living God that I've been
[27:00] talking about is the one who can help
[27:02] you with those needs father I ask you
[27:05] right now to reveal yourself to every
[27:09] viewer to every listener those who have
[27:12] only known you by dry religion I ask
[27:16] that you unveil yourself and reveal
[27:20] yourself in power in love in reality Let
[27:24] Your Presence become real right now in
[27:28] that home in that place of business Lord
[27:32] Jesus let your precious Holy Spirit draw
[27:36] men and women to a deeper relationship
[27:39] with you I ask that in the name of the
[27:41] Lord Jesus Christ thank you for watching
[27:44] the Eagles cry I hope you'll tune in
[27:46] again I've got a lot more to share God
[27:48] bless you bye-bye for now
