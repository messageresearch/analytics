TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign I want to tell you one of the most important things that you can cultivate in your relationship with God is Trust if we can learn to trust him and folks has he ever given us a reason not to trust then why in our human element do we struggle so to believe that he always has our best in mind he constantly has our best in mind whether it looks like it or not you see the serpent began his assault on the human Mind by injecting it without Satan gained his way in by touching the carnality of Eve by using her Earthly nature to do so he inserted the seed of discrepancy and he then had a Channel with which to give her knowledge obtained in an illegal way and the fruit which was the price to pay of that excess was death I want you to know that was the most expensive exchange that had ever taken place because by believing that lie and yielding her mind and body to that lie death entered into the picture we know that death was not a part of God's original plan for Adam and Eve are you with me it's not how it was allowing this to transpire he would be able to come and redeem all mankind and so it was a part of the Redemption plan but originally Adam was made the prophet even tells us that Adam was made to never die but because this seed of discrepancy was injected death gained access to the sons of God now he would always have something in her from that moment on there would always be a representation of that lie that Eve carried around in her and since she didn't know full Redemption like you do did you know that full Redemption is possible today so that when Satan comes to try to find an access point in your life there is none how many of you want to live under the fullness of redemption we're not living there fully like we need to because all the enemy has to do is March up and we and he knows the place he knows our weakness he knows our vulnerability he knows where we now he knows where we struggle he knows what emotion to play on because if the enemy could have come in and placed a seed of discrepancy in our Lord we would have been in trouble Jesus had confidence in the word that he was and he knew that Satan was coming and he knew that when Satan got there it wasn't going to be man to meet him it was going to be God the word to meet him and the word will shut down the devil anytime of the day the word will shut down the devil even in the Midnight Hour anytime anywhere under any condition the word will shut down the LIE of the devil
