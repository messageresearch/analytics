[1:05:28] ease
[1:05:29] it will not be a
[1:05:30] long delivery
[1:05:32] ephesians chapter 5 i have a very
[1:05:34] strange subject this morning
[1:05:40] and i'm just depending on the lord
[1:05:41] completely verse 22
[1:05:46] ephesians chapter 5 verse 22 wives
[1:05:50] submit yourselves unto your own husbands
[1:05:53] as unto the lord
[1:05:56] for the husband
[1:05:57] is the head of the wife
[1:06:00] even as christ
[1:06:02] is the head of the church
[1:06:05] and he is the savior
[1:06:08] of the body
[1:06:10] therefore as the church is subject unto
[1:06:13] christ
[1:06:14] so let the wives be to their own
[1:06:16] husbands in everything
[1:06:20] husbands
[1:06:21] love your wives
[1:06:23] even as christ
[1:06:25] also
[1:06:26] loved the church
[1:06:28] and gave himself for it
[1:06:30] that he might sanctify
[1:06:32] and cleanse it
[1:06:34] with the washing of water
[1:06:37] by the word
[1:06:40] that he might present it to himself
[1:06:43] a glorious church
[1:06:46] not having spot
[1:06:48] or wrinkle
[1:06:50] or any such thing
[1:06:52] but that it should be holy
[1:06:54] and without blemish
[1:06:57] so ought men to love their wives as
[1:07:00] their own bodies
[1:07:02] he that loveth his wife
[1:07:05] loveth
[1:07:06] himself
[1:07:08] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[1:07:13] but nourisheth
[1:07:14] and cherisheth it
[1:07:17] even
[1:07:18] as the lord
[1:07:19] the church
[1:07:21] for we are members of his body
[1:07:24] of his flesh
[1:07:26] and of his bones
[1:07:28] for this cause
[1:07:30] shall a man
[1:07:31] leave his father
[1:07:33] and mother
[1:07:35] and shall be joined unto his wife
[1:07:38] and they too
[1:07:40] shall be
[1:07:41] one flesh
[1:07:43] this is a great mystery
[1:07:46] but i speak concerning
[1:07:49] christ
[1:07:50] and the church
[1:07:52] nevertheless
[1:07:54] let every one of you in particular so
[1:07:56] love his wife
[1:07:58] even as himself
[1:08:00] and the wife see
[1:08:02] that she reverence
[1:08:04] her husband
[1:08:06] may the lord add
[1:08:08] a blessing to the reading of his word
[1:08:11] and you may have your seats
[1:08:13] today
[1:08:32] we have
[1:08:34] come to understand
[1:08:39] through a
[1:08:41] prophet messenger
[1:08:44] he told us that the book of ephesians
[1:08:48] parallels
[1:08:49] the book of joshua
[1:08:52] when we think about the book of joshua
[1:08:56] we think about
[1:08:58] when
[1:09:00] god
[1:09:02] finished with moses ministry
[1:09:06] and he laid the burden upon joshua
[1:09:10] to take the children of israel
[1:09:13] into their promised land
[1:09:16] now the land was promised to them many
[1:09:20] years before
[1:09:22] but they had not yet acquired the
[1:09:24] promise
[1:09:26] but the promise was about to be theirs
[1:09:30] but the promise was not going to be
[1:09:32] theirs without fighting for it
[1:09:38] when
[1:09:39] moses was sent
[1:09:41] to lead god's people out of egypt's
[1:09:44] bondage
[1:09:46] moses did not know
[1:09:48] that he was going to have
[1:09:51] a battle on his hands
[1:09:54] to get the people to
[1:09:57] believe him as a prophet
[1:09:59] to believe him as a deliverer
[1:10:02] moses did not choose the job that god
[1:10:05] gave to him
[1:10:07] god laid that upon moses and when he
[1:10:10] laid it upon moses
[1:10:13] he laid it upon him
[1:10:15] without moses's natural abilities
[1:10:19] now all that moses went through to get
[1:10:23] to that point of being the deliverer
[1:10:26] god used those things
[1:10:29] to help him to have some understanding
[1:10:32] but god had to rip some things out of
[1:10:35] him before he was fully equipped to go
[1:10:38] in and be able to
[1:10:41] lead god's people out of that bondage
[1:10:45] so
[1:10:46] god sets up this scenario where that
[1:10:50] moses recognizes who he is he recognizes
[1:10:55] that there is some injustice
[1:10:58] that is going on amongst the hebrew
[1:11:00] people he goes down among them he
[1:11:03] decides he's going to get right down in
[1:11:05] the dirt with them and he lays aside all
[1:11:09] of his garments of egypt and he gets
[1:11:12] right down in the dirt with them and he
[1:11:14] begins to
[1:11:16] work alongside them and he sees the
[1:11:19] injustice and he
[1:11:21] becomes angry with what he sees and he
[1:11:25] decides that he was going to kill one of
[1:11:28] the egyptian task masters and bury him
[1:11:30] in the sand
[1:11:31] then the scripture tells us that the
[1:11:34] next day he's working and there's the
[1:11:37] hebrew brothers that are quarreling and
[1:11:39] moses tries to break up the fight and
[1:11:41] they say what are you going to do the
[1:11:43] same thing to us
[1:11:44] and moses realizes that he's found out
[1:11:47] and he flees for his life and god takes
[1:11:50] him on the backside of the desert where
[1:11:52] he meets the pillar of fire
[1:11:55] and there is a long period of time it
[1:11:59] doesn't make sense in our minds that
[1:12:02] that god would at 40 years old take
[1:12:04] moses out of egypt and begin to strip
[1:12:08] him of all of egypt
[1:12:11] to strip him of everything that he ever
[1:12:14] was and begin to reveal to him what he's
[1:12:18] been called to and it takes another 40
[1:12:20] years for him to get ready to go into
[1:12:23] egypt and to lead god's people out and
[1:12:26] god gets him ready
[1:12:28] moses meets the pillar of fire and he
[1:12:31] sees that he has got to go and lead
[1:12:35] god's children out of this uh egypt land
[1:12:38] and so he does that and we know all the
[1:12:41] sequence of events how that they were up
[1:12:44] against the red sea and then god opens
[1:12:46] up the red sea and god takes them across
[1:12:49] and we've been hearing how that uh
[1:12:53] here brother shelley has been preaching
[1:12:55] how that when spies were sent into that
[1:12:58] land uh to scope it out how that some of
[1:13:02] them came back with uh an idea in their
[1:13:06] mind they had an imagination that these
[1:13:09] people were were
[1:13:12] that they were all giants and we're
[1:13:14] grasshoppers in in in
[1:13:16] in front of them and and they had this
[1:13:19] perception of what they were
[1:13:22] and so then god had to
[1:13:26] begin to strip out of them
[1:13:31] god had to strip out of them all of
[1:13:34] their conceptions of what they were
[1:13:40] some people are too proud
[1:13:42] and some people are too
[1:13:44] defeated we need a middle of the road
[1:13:47] where that we know who we are in christ
[1:13:50] jesus
[1:13:51] so god through 40 years of of wandering
[1:13:55] around in the wilderness god strips uh
[1:13:59] all of that uh uh pride and he strips
[1:14:02] all of that uh
[1:14:04] idea that
[1:14:06] i can't do anything i'm just a
[1:14:08] grasshopper in the sight of these giants
[1:14:12] he strips all of that away from them and
[1:14:15] all of the men of war they die out
[1:14:17] that have
[1:14:19] that generation and god gets them ready
[1:14:24] now we know that moses
[1:14:27] had an authority with god
[1:14:30] that was
[1:14:32] so
[1:14:33] beautiful
[1:14:35] but the people
[1:14:37] made him mad
[1:14:43] moses got upset with the people
[1:14:48] and when he got upset with the people
[1:14:52] god told him when the people needed
[1:14:55] water
[1:14:56] the rock had already been smitten once
[1:15:01] god told moses speak to the rock
[1:15:05] but moses in his anger
[1:15:09] in his frustration with the people
[1:15:13] and i have
[1:15:15] no
[1:15:16] rocks to throw at moses because we have
[1:15:19] all been in that kind of a fix where the
[1:15:22] people upset us they made us mad they
[1:15:25] made us angry
[1:15:26] and we did things that we weren't
[1:15:28] supposed to but in this case because of
[1:15:31] the authority that moses had because of
[1:15:34] the calling that was in his life and he
[1:15:37] was standing before the people
[1:15:40] rather than speak to the rock he took
[1:15:42] his rod and he smote the rock
[1:15:45] the second time
[1:15:48] and this was
[1:15:50] not to be so
[1:15:52] he was supposed to speak to the rock for
[1:15:55] the water to come out because of this
[1:15:58] god came to moses and told him
[1:16:01] you will not lead the people into that
[1:16:04] land i am going to
[1:16:08] raise up i've raised up joshua and the
[1:16:11] anointing that uh to lead this people is
[1:16:14] going to be placed upon joshua
[1:16:17] we have been told that the that
[1:16:20] our joshua is the holy ghost
[1:16:24] he is to lead us
[1:16:26] moses my servant is dead
[1:16:33] now joshua
[1:16:35] i'm laying this commission over on you
[1:16:38] this is now uh the holy ghost leading
[1:16:42] his many membered bride into their
[1:16:46] promised land joshua in the natural was
[1:16:49] given the commission to take the people
[1:16:53] of god into their promised land
[1:16:56] now this promised land
[1:16:59] was
[1:17:00] already theirs it was a promise
[1:17:04] it was an inheritance
[1:17:06] but it was not yet in their hand
[1:17:11] they had not yet experienced the reality
[1:17:14] of it
[1:17:16] and so
[1:17:17] god
[1:17:18] in his infinite wisdom
[1:17:21] he gives joshua instruction
[1:17:24] to go in
[1:17:26] and to conquer this land piece by piece
[1:17:30] in conquering this land
[1:17:33] the people had to be subject to their
[1:17:36] joshua
[1:17:38] joshua the son of none they had to
[1:17:41] listen to what joshua instructed them
[1:17:46] now we know that when they went to
[1:17:49] jericho god gave victory
[1:17:53] but there was a battle because someone
[1:17:57] got it in their mind
[1:17:59] that they did not want to listen to the
[1:18:02] instruction of joshua
[1:18:04] they decided that joshua was not
[1:18:08] handling things maybe fast enough or
[1:18:12] maybe this guy thought that he was not
[1:18:14] getting enough credit or he wasn't
[1:18:17] getting enough pay for his services we
[1:18:20] don't really know what was in his mind
[1:18:22] but the bible tells us that they went to
[1:18:26] battle
[1:18:27] and they lost men
[1:18:29] and this was not
[1:18:31] what they were used to
[1:18:34] be happening
[1:18:36] they were going to battles and not
[1:18:37] losing anybody
[1:18:39] now they went to a battle at ai and they
[1:18:42] lost men
[1:18:43] this was because there was a man among
[1:18:46] them
[1:18:47] that was not satisfied to be in his
[1:18:50] position in his calling that he was
[1:18:53] called for
[1:18:54] and he decided i'm not getting proper
[1:18:57] pay here i i need a little more spending
[1:18:59] money and he took these things now the
[1:19:02] funny thing is when he took them he hid
[1:19:05] them
[1:19:08] he did he didn't even have the he didn't
[1:19:10] even have the joy of spending them
[1:19:13] because he had to hide them because he
[1:19:15] knew he was a guilty man
[1:19:17] and when he hid these things
[1:19:20] and and these the the
[1:19:23] they realize that there's trouble in
[1:19:25] this camp
[1:19:27] we have got an issue here
[1:19:29] that we've got to deal with we should
[1:19:32] not have lost men
[1:19:34] so they begin to cast lots and it comes
[1:19:36] down to aiken and he makes his admission
[1:19:39] of what he did and he was dealt with in
[1:19:42] such a way that uh it would cause people
[1:19:45] not to want to do anything like that
[1:19:47] again but as they're taking this land
[1:19:51] god has given it to them piece by piece
[1:19:54] you remember he said i can't give it to
[1:19:56] you all at one time
[1:19:59] because if i give it to you all at one
[1:20:02] time there's not enough of you to occupy
[1:20:05] it there's not there's not enough of you
[1:20:08] to occupy the land and if you don't
[1:20:11] occupy the land then there are going to
[1:20:14] be some others that are going to come in
[1:20:16] and they're going to try to usurp
[1:20:18] authority on that that you cannot watch
[1:20:21] over and protect
[1:20:23] okay so
[1:20:25] god gives them the land little by little
[1:20:30] and as he is giving them the land
[1:20:33] they're conquering one city after
[1:20:36] another
[1:20:37] and they're inhabiting the land as god
[1:20:40] gives them victory
[1:20:42] now this is the way it is
[1:20:45] with the people of god
[1:20:48] we start out with our salvation
[1:20:51] experience and we know that it's the
[1:20:54] goodness of god that he would give us
[1:20:57] eternal life that he would come to us
[1:20:59] with salvation to be able to call on the
[1:21:03] name of the lord the bible tells us the
[1:21:06] man that calls on the name of the lord
[1:21:08] shall be saved and
[1:21:11] this is just simple
[1:21:13] gospel
[1:21:16] whosoever calls on the name of the lord
[1:21:19] shall be saved
[1:21:21] but that man hasn't conquered any ground
[1:21:26] he has done one little thing and that is
[1:21:28] he's called on the name of the lord now
[1:21:30] this is the beginnings
[1:21:35] but god wants to lead him further in
[1:21:38] that experience he wants to give him
[1:21:41] more
[1:21:42] of himself and so he beckons to him
[1:21:48] and he says
[1:21:49] repent
[1:21:59] i cannot explain all of the mystery to
[1:22:02] you
[1:22:04] but i know that there are people
[1:22:07] through the years
[1:22:08] that god has shown mercy to
[1:22:12] that lived wickedly all of their lives
[1:22:15] and at the last moment
[1:22:20] they called on the lord
[1:22:22] i don't know what their words were
[1:22:24] but i know that god is rich in mercy
[1:22:28] and he knows how to grant mercy
[1:22:31] and he knows
[1:22:33] all of the
[1:22:36] the whole total of a man
[1:22:39] every path that he ever went through and
[1:22:42] and every hard trial that he went
[1:22:44] through
[1:22:45] things that might look easy to us but to
[1:22:48] them it might look difficult
[1:22:52] and so
[1:22:53] it is not our
[1:22:55] job to
[1:22:57] try to judge a man in the path that he
[1:23:00] is walking in
[1:23:03] but it's our job to pray for one another
[1:23:06] and to ask the lord to give grace and
[1:23:09] strength and help to each of our fellow
[1:23:12] brothers and sisters in the place that
[1:23:15] they are so that you can be led by the
[1:23:19] spirit of god
[1:23:21] as you're walking this journey then the
[1:23:23] holy spirit if if you call on the name
[1:23:26] of the lord and if there's something in
[1:23:28] you that you want to walk further with
[1:23:30] him then he beckons to you repents
[1:23:36] do a turnaround
[1:23:39] get rid of all of that that you've
[1:23:41] carried for so long
[1:23:44] all of the sin the weights the things
[1:23:46] that beset you
[1:23:48] the unbelief
[1:23:50] i'm still getting rid of my unbelief
[1:23:54] still working i'm still taking the land
[1:23:57] by my joshua the holy ghost
[1:24:00] because he abides in me he's giving me
[1:24:04] the grace and he's giving me the
[1:24:06] leadership to be able to conquer the the
[1:24:09] amalekites and the hittites and the
[1:24:12] hivites to defeat all of them all of
[1:24:16] them in my life
[1:24:18] and it starts out with repentance
[1:24:21] because what i repent of today
[1:24:25] is i'm repenting of everything that i
[1:24:27] can see
[1:24:33] there are still things in you and in me
[1:24:37] that i cannot yet see
[1:24:41] but there will come a time when the holy
[1:24:43] spirit
[1:24:44] will take me deeper into the land
[1:24:48] and he will beckon to me
[1:24:51] repent
[1:24:56] it's another giant
[1:24:59] another hittite
[1:25:00] another amalekite
[1:25:03] remember
[1:25:04] little amalekites
[1:25:06] grow up to be big amalekites
[1:25:10] and there are some of us sitting here
[1:25:12] today
[1:25:14] that god called on us once upon a time
[1:25:17] to kill a little amalekite
[1:25:20] and we didn't do it
[1:25:22] whether out of rebellion or selfishness
[1:25:25] or whatever it may have been and that
[1:25:27] little amalekite has become a big
[1:25:29] amalekite
[1:25:32] and the holy spirit is now beckoning us
[1:25:36] it's time to repent he is once again
[1:25:40] pointing out the malachite in our life
[1:25:43] kill it
[1:25:45] kill it
[1:25:48] that seems so brutal
[1:25:50] brutal
[1:25:52] when god gave joshua instruction you go
[1:25:55] in the land and you kill them all
[1:25:58] don't spare one of them
[1:26:00] don't you spare the little children not
[1:26:03] the mamas not the daddies not the old
[1:26:05] men not the old women you kill them all
[1:26:09] now in our in our 2022 mentality this
[1:26:13] seems so cruel it seems so wicked it
[1:26:17] seems uh such that why would god do such
[1:26:20] as that
[1:26:22] because god already saw that those
[1:26:25] amalekites whether they were little they
[1:26:27] would grow up to be big ones and i don't
[1:26:30] care how embedded they are into the
[1:26:33] israelite camp
[1:26:35] there was an amalekite nature inside of
[1:26:38] them that was in their dna and it would
[1:26:42] in some way manifest along the way and
[1:26:46] and somewhere that that
[1:26:48] that
[1:26:49] spirit would
[1:26:51] come out
[1:26:55] so god said wipe them out
[1:26:59] and possess the land
[1:27:01] wherever the soles of your feet go
[1:27:05] it's yours
[1:27:08] now let's come back to the book of
[1:27:10] ephesians
[1:27:12] wives
[1:27:14] submit yourselves
[1:27:16] to your own husbands
[1:27:19] as unto the lord
[1:27:22] now
[1:27:23] i don't want to dwell a long time on
[1:27:25] this
[1:27:26] but
[1:27:27] submitting
[1:27:30] is a level of trust
[1:27:34] to the man that god called to be your
[1:27:38] husband
[1:27:39] speaking to wives
[1:27:45] it takes a level of trust
[1:27:49] for a woman
[1:27:51] to trust her husband
[1:27:56] this is why that we as preachers and
[1:27:59] parents
[1:28:00] have stressed to our young people
[1:28:03] not to be unequally yoked with an
[1:28:06] unbeliever
[1:28:08] because when you are unequally yoked
[1:28:11] with an unbeliever
[1:28:13] and that man that you chose and you went
[1:28:18] away from the lord and you chose him and
[1:28:20] he chose you
[1:28:21] and and you have decided as a woman to
[1:28:25] continue following the lord but you have
[1:28:27] a man that doesn't want to follow the
[1:28:30] lord then it becomes an issue for that
[1:28:33] wife to submit herself
[1:28:36] to that man
[1:28:38] as unto the lord
[1:28:41] because he doesn't follow the lord she
[1:28:44] doesn't trust him
[1:28:48] especially when it comes to spiritual
[1:28:50] decisions
[1:28:52] she doesn't trust him
[1:28:54] so once again i speak to the young folks
[1:28:58] that are not yet married
[1:29:00] you be careful and you seek the lord
[1:29:03] with everything that is within you
[1:29:07] and you make sure that you have the
[1:29:09] baptism of the holy ghost and you make
[1:29:12] sure that that one that you choose has
[1:29:15] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:29:20] not just speaking in tongues
[1:29:24] the real genuine baptism of the holy
[1:29:27] ghost that continues to guide that
[1:29:30] person into all truth
[1:29:34] because
[1:29:34] there are there there are
[1:29:37] again
[1:29:38] as god led the children of israel into
[1:29:41] that promised land they took the ground
[1:29:44] piece by piece
[1:29:46] they did not take the land all at one
[1:29:49] time
[1:29:50] they took it piece by piece
[1:29:53] and there are some who go so far and
[1:29:56] they quit
[1:29:59] they say i have the baptism of the holy
[1:30:02] ghost but they never let the spirit of
[1:30:04] god lead them any farther than that
[1:30:07] initial experience
[1:30:10] but we've got to go beyond that initial
[1:30:12] experience that first experience and
[1:30:15] we've got to keep walking taking the
[1:30:17] land taking the land taking the land
[1:30:20] taking the land
[1:30:22] so the wives
[1:30:24] paul is speaking to the ephesian church
[1:30:26] submit yourselves to your own husbands
[1:30:29] as unto the lord
[1:30:31] now
[1:30:33] the scripture tells us concerning wives
[1:30:37] in the book of titus
[1:30:39] it talks about the aged men being sober
[1:30:42] grave temperate sound in faith and
[1:30:45] charity and patience
[1:30:47] this is titus chapter 2
[1:30:49] the aged women likewise that they be in
[1:30:52] behavior as becometh holiness
[1:30:55] not false accusers
[1:30:57] not given to much wine
[1:30:59] teachers of good things that they may
[1:31:03] teach the young women
[1:31:06] all right older women
[1:31:08] here's your job
[1:31:10] that they may teach the young women
[1:31:13] to be sober
[1:31:15] to love their husbands
[1:31:18] to love
[1:31:19] their children
[1:31:21] now
[1:31:22] older men
[1:31:25] you have been given the job to be sober
[1:31:29] honest
[1:31:32] temperate or to have self-control
[1:31:35] sound in faith in charity and patience
[1:31:38] and the aged women
[1:31:40] are supposed to be in behavior
[1:31:43] as becometh holiness because you are
[1:31:46] teaching the young women
[1:31:48] to be sober
[1:31:49] to love their husbands
[1:31:51] to love their children
[1:31:57] so if you hate your husband
[1:32:02] don't teach
[1:32:08] all right
[1:32:09] to love their children to be discreet
[1:32:12] chaste
[1:32:14] keepers at home
[1:32:18] good
[1:32:20] obedient to their own husbands
[1:32:24] didn't get no husband amen there
[1:32:28] that the word of god be not blasphemed
[1:32:31] young men likewise exhort to be sober
[1:32:33] minded now i just want to touch on this
[1:32:37] keepers at home
[1:32:40] now i am a man who believes
[1:32:44] that a woman
[1:32:46] a married woman
[1:32:48] especially with children
[1:32:51] should not have a job out in the
[1:32:52] marketplace i realize that we live in
[1:32:56] 2022
[1:32:58] so don't throw rocks at me
[1:33:00] i'm just
[1:33:01] old-fashioned
[1:33:04] i am thankful
[1:33:05] that god made a way that my wife could
[1:33:07] be in the home
[1:33:09] now
[1:33:10] i want to take this word keepers because
[1:33:14] i am not going to let the
[1:33:16] wives the mothers
[1:33:18] get out of this part of it because it is
[1:33:21] very
[1:33:22] very important a job that god has given
[1:33:26] you
[1:33:27] your mothers
[1:33:28] women you have been given a job to be
[1:33:32] keepers
[1:33:34] at home
[1:33:37] now
[1:33:38] we could turn this word into
[1:33:42] you should be a homemaker
[1:33:44] a woman's job is to be in the kitchen
[1:33:48] i'm not going to go there today
[1:33:50] i'm glad my wife is home when i get home
[1:33:54] most of the time
[1:33:59] but i want you to look at this word
[1:34:01] keepers at home in a different light
[1:34:06] because
[1:34:08] this is the same word that is used in
[1:34:12] the book of genesis
[1:34:14] when god told the man that he was to
[1:34:20] keep
[1:34:21] the land the garden of eden and then
[1:34:24] this same word is in genesis i believe 3
[1:34:27] maybe 16 somewhere around there when
[1:34:30] when uh the uh cherubim
[1:34:34] were put at the gate after the man and
[1:34:37] the woman were kicked out of the garden
[1:34:39] to keep the way to the tree of life
[1:34:44] they were that the cherry beans were to
[1:34:46] guard
[1:34:47] the way
[1:34:49] to the tree of life
[1:34:54] women
[1:34:55] young women are to be keepers at home
[1:34:58] you have a job to guard the gate
[1:35:06] you have a job as women
[1:35:09] to guard the gate of your home of your
[1:35:13] children
[1:35:15] the man called out into the workforce is
[1:35:17] not there all the time the woman there
[1:35:20] to guard or to keep the home to watch
[1:35:24] things that are coming in
[1:35:27] this is not solely the husband's
[1:35:29] responsibility
[1:35:31] now the husband is the head of the
[1:35:32] household
[1:35:34] but the woman is to guard
[1:35:39] at home
[1:35:42] because every which way you turn
[1:35:46] the enemy is looking for a way to get to
[1:35:50] your husband
[1:35:52] you
[1:35:53] your children
[1:35:55] the enemy is looking for a way to get to
[1:35:59] you
[1:36:00] because he wants to destroy the family
[1:36:03] structure
[1:36:07] so the woman is to guard
[1:36:12] i don't know how closely you've ever
[1:36:14] looked at proverbs 31
[1:36:17] but it appears
[1:36:19] that that
[1:36:21] proverbs 31 woman was not an idol woman
[1:36:29] but she looked well
[1:36:32] to the ways of her house
[1:36:36] she watched over it
[1:36:38] her candle burned in the night time
[1:36:42] she was careful to make sure
[1:36:45] she did business she saw oversaw
[1:36:48] business transactions she was an active
[1:36:51] woman
[1:36:53] now i don't know at what point she
[1:36:55] became this active
[1:36:58] but when you have small children in the
[1:37:00] house
[1:37:02] as the children are growing up it is
[1:37:04] important for you as women young women
[1:37:07] mothers for you to watch over and
[1:37:10] protect
[1:37:12] to guard to keep
[1:37:15] at home
[1:37:17] to guard what is coming
[1:37:19] because like a roaring lion
[1:37:23] the enemy is coming to see who he can
[1:37:26] devour
[1:37:28] and mamas and daddies if he can't devour
[1:37:31] you he will try to devour your children
[1:37:34] and this is why it is so important for
[1:37:37] the moms the the young women the the
[1:37:40] mothers to be watchers to be keepers
[1:37:43] it's not just the men that are watchers
[1:37:46] in the home it is the women as well to
[1:37:49] guard and to keep the home and so women
[1:37:53] when you submit yourself to your own
[1:37:55] husband
[1:37:58] this is a starting point
[1:38:01] of guarding the house
[1:38:05] submitting
[1:38:07] to your husband
[1:38:09] as unto the lord
[1:38:12] so as you submit to your husband
[1:38:15] then
[1:38:16] you recognize that
[1:38:18] he is under leadership
[1:38:21] now i'm speaking to believers here a a
[1:38:24] husband that is serving the lord and
[1:38:27] trying with everything in him to to
[1:38:29] serve the lord with uh
[1:38:31] the spirit of god in him the woman the
[1:38:34] wife realizes that he
[1:38:37] is under the leadership
[1:38:39] of the holy spirit
[1:38:42] and so she wants to subject herself to
[1:38:45] her husband
[1:38:47] in everything
[1:38:49] now
[1:38:51] verse 25 husbands
[1:38:55] love
[1:38:57] your wives
[1:39:02] husbands
[1:39:05] love
[1:39:06] your wife
[1:39:11] now we can go back to the book of
[1:39:12] genesis
[1:39:14] we can see how that
[1:39:16] all of this came about
[1:39:19] we can see that
[1:39:20] there was sin in the garden
[1:39:23] that god said that
[1:39:25] man would rule over the women
[1:39:28] it would rule over the wife
[1:39:32] and that was not
[1:39:35] just so that he could
[1:39:37] carry a rod of iron and beat her on the
[1:39:39] head
[1:39:40] it was to be a covering for her
[1:39:46] remember when
[1:39:49] eve opened up the woman really she did
[1:39:51] not have a name until after the fall
[1:39:54] the woman opened up her mind
[1:39:56] she opened up the womb of her mind
[1:40:02] and she allowed
[1:40:04] the words
[1:40:06] the enemy
[1:40:07] to come into her mind
[1:40:10] and then it became an act
[1:40:14] and then
[1:40:15] the man realizing
[1:40:17] what had happened
[1:40:19] he went in with eyes wide open
[1:40:21] and he covered her
[1:40:26] and god
[1:40:28] told the man that he would rule over the
[1:40:31] woman over the woman
[1:40:34] now i am not trying to
[1:40:36] stir up any trouble
[1:40:39] with men or with women i'm trying to let
[1:40:42] you know that god has an order
[1:40:46] and when we
[1:40:48] get out of god's order
[1:40:51] then our lives become chaos
[1:40:56] we need to stay in god's divine order
[1:41:00] so the woman was put
[1:41:03] under the headship of the man but now
[1:41:06] the husband
[1:41:08] has been given a an instruction
[1:41:12] to love
[1:41:13] your wives
[1:41:15] even as christ also loved the church
[1:41:19] and gave himself for it
[1:41:23] now
[1:41:24] i just want to stop
[1:41:27] because
[1:41:28] he said husbands
[1:41:30] love your wives now what
[1:41:33] would that look like
[1:41:35] i don't know where else to go to except
[1:41:37] for first corinthians chapter 13.
[1:41:40] and find out
[1:41:42] the
[1:41:43] um
[1:41:46] what love really looks like the
[1:41:48] attributes of love
[1:41:51] so in verses 4 through 8 of chapter 13
[1:41:54] we can see that
[1:41:55] love
[1:41:56] suffers long
[1:42:00] so any of us short fused husbands
[1:42:04] we got to work on that
[1:42:07] because
[1:42:09] love
[1:42:10] suffers long
[1:42:12] love is kind
[1:42:17] now
[1:42:19] when a
[1:42:21] man begins
[1:42:23] to
[1:42:24] beat on his
[1:42:26] wife because she did not do something
[1:42:29] the way
[1:42:31] that
[1:42:32] he wanted her to
[1:42:35] then there is a problem the husband is
[1:42:38] no longer
[1:42:40] loving the wife as christ loved the
[1:42:42] church
[1:42:44] all right so
[1:42:46] the king james uses the word charity
[1:42:50] which means love
[1:42:52] charity suffers long charity is kind
[1:42:56] charity envieth not
[1:43:00] charity vaunteth not itself
[1:43:04] this is not a word
[1:43:06] that
[1:43:07] we typically use in 2022
[1:43:11] unless you speak shakespeare english
[1:43:17] to vaught
[1:43:19] means to boast oneself
[1:43:23] it means to self-display
[1:43:27] employing
[1:43:29] rhetorical embellishments
[1:43:32] in praising oneself excessively
[1:43:37] so there's just some definition for
[1:43:39] vaunteth not itself
[1:43:41] any man that needs to constantly be
[1:43:44] boasting about who he is
[1:43:46] you need to work on it
[1:43:49] charity is not puffed up
[1:43:52] see pride goes before destruction
[1:43:57] and a haughty spirit
[1:43:59] before a fall
[1:44:02] and when we as a husband
[1:44:06] as a man now this really goes for
[1:44:08] everybody this is not man exclusive here
[1:44:11] all right when we talk about love and
[1:44:14] not being puffed up pride is a problem
[1:44:18] with all of us
[1:44:23] we can be so proud and puffed up
[1:44:28] and exert ourselves in front of
[1:44:31] everybody to try to display who we are
[1:44:35] and do you know that there's a pride
[1:44:39] in people
[1:44:43] to see
[1:44:45] how nasty they can be
[1:44:52] it goes from top all the way to the
[1:44:54] gutter
[1:44:59] pride works in so many ways that we
[1:45:02] don't see sometimes and god it takes the
[1:45:05] holy spirit as he's leading us into our
[1:45:08] land of promise it takes the holy spirit
[1:45:11] to point it out to us so that we
[1:45:14] do not become puffed up
[1:45:17] because we can be one who is out in the
[1:45:20] forefront all the time and constantly
[1:45:23] puffing up our chest to say who we are
[1:45:26] or it can be somebody that stays down
[1:45:29] and and they they're so proud of how
[1:45:32] humble they are
[1:45:37] charity does not behave itself
[1:45:40] unseemingly
[1:45:44] does not seek her own
[1:45:48] charity is not easily provoked well
[1:45:51] let's stop there a second
[1:45:57] because sometimes
[1:46:00] sometimes
[1:46:02] we become easily provoked
[1:46:09] fathers are to be men who do not provoke
[1:46:12] their children to anger
[1:46:17] and when our children
[1:46:20] do things that we don't like
[1:46:25] so many times
[1:46:27] depending on where we are
[1:46:29] what stresses we find out in our lives
[1:46:32] we
[1:46:34] react
[1:46:36] from that provocation of our children or
[1:46:39] a wife
[1:46:43] how do you think men become wife beaters
[1:46:48] they're easily provoked
[1:46:51] and it doesn't take anything to set them
[1:46:53] off
[1:46:55] men this is why we need the baptism of
[1:46:58] the holy ghost
[1:47:01] and we need a refilling on a refilling
[1:47:04] on a refilling
[1:47:06] because there are stresses of life that
[1:47:09] we do not need to allow to easily
[1:47:13] provoke us
[1:47:17] is not easily provoked
[1:47:20] thinketh no evil
[1:47:24] what are you doing preacher
[1:47:25] i'm talking about husbands loving their
[1:47:27] wives
[1:47:28] these are all the attributes that paul
[1:47:32] spoke in first corinthians church 13.
[1:47:36] thinketh no evil
[1:47:49] when a man
[1:47:52] begins to think
[1:47:56] that
[1:47:58] his wife is cheating on him
[1:48:06] he begins to think evil of her
[1:48:13] little signs he says
[1:48:17] that she is
[1:48:19] stepping out maybe
[1:48:21] now this can go either way
[1:48:24] and go either way
[1:48:26] i'm talking about husbands loving their
[1:48:29] wives as christ loved the church
[1:48:36] we live in a society
[1:48:39] where that
[1:48:42] there is a lack of commitment
[1:48:50] and
[1:48:52] what is that
[1:48:53] place
[1:48:54] ikea
[1:48:56] is that the name of that place
[1:48:58] the throwaway furniture
[1:49:02] that's about how marriages have come
[1:49:08] you know
[1:49:10] i don't like this one i'll throw it out
[1:49:11] and i'll go to ikea and i'll get me
[1:49:12] another one it's cheap
[1:49:16] and see this is the reason why people
[1:49:17] don't marry anymore
[1:49:20] they shack up
[1:49:23] but god instituted marriage
[1:49:26] one man
[1:49:27] one woman
[1:49:30] can i preach that here
[1:49:33] one man
[1:49:34] one woman
[1:49:35] is a marriage
[1:49:38] in holy matrimony
[1:49:41] i believe it ought to be
[1:49:43] with a minister of the gospel
[1:49:46] pronouncing
[1:49:48] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:49:55] god instituted this marriage
[1:49:59] because he was trying
[1:50:01] to show
[1:50:03] a picture
[1:50:06] in the end time
[1:50:08] let me read the rest of these concerning
[1:50:10] love thinketh no evil
[1:50:13] rejoices not in iniquity
[1:50:16] rejoices in the truth
[1:50:21] beareth all things
[1:50:23] believeth all things
[1:50:26] hopeth all things
[1:50:28] endureth all things
[1:50:31] charity
[1:50:33] never
[1:50:34] fails
[1:50:35] husbands
[1:50:37] love your wives
[1:50:40] ephesians 5 26
[1:50:42] 5 5 25
[1:50:44] husbands
[1:50:45] love your wives
[1:50:47] even as christ also loved the church and
[1:50:50] gave himself for it
[1:50:53] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:50:56] with the washing
[1:50:58] of water by the word
[1:51:01] now what i want us to see today is
[1:51:04] this great mystery that god is trying to
[1:51:08] has been trying to unfold in the in the
[1:51:12] body of believers down through time
[1:51:15] he is trying to show
[1:51:18] by a man and a woman in a marriage he is
[1:51:24] trying to show a great mystery
[1:51:31] he said
[1:51:33] this is a great mystery
[1:51:35] referring to marriage
[1:51:37] but i speak
[1:51:39] concerning christ and the church
[1:51:43] this is a marriage that god
[1:51:46] is trying to uh bring about in the end
[1:51:50] time for the people of god to recognize
[1:51:54] that wives need to be in subject to
[1:51:57] their own husbands
[1:52:04] not to a denominational hierarchy
[1:52:08] not to an organized religion
[1:52:14] but a believer is subject to christ
[1:52:20] and god has put in divine order
[1:52:24] in the church
[1:52:25] apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[1:52:29] evangelists
[1:52:31] the five-fold ministry he put in the
[1:52:34] church for the end time
[1:52:36] and why did he do it
[1:52:40] for the perfecting
[1:52:43] of the saints
[1:52:46] he used he uses
[1:52:49] imperfect vessels
[1:52:52] to bring about a perfecting in the body
[1:52:55] of christ and it was because that he the
[1:52:59] headship
[1:53:01] brought it down into the earth to bring
[1:53:04] about
[1:53:05] all of what we're seeing now
[1:53:09] but he's speaking concerning christ
[1:53:12] and the church
[1:53:14] and
[1:53:15] he says for husbands to love their wives
[1:53:18] even as christ
[1:53:20] loved the church
[1:53:23] he's trying to demonstrate to us
[1:53:27] in an earthly way
[1:53:31] with husbands and wives families he's
[1:53:34] trying to demonstrate
[1:53:37] something
[1:53:38] that is a continual revelation or a
[1:53:41] great mystery
[1:53:43] he is trying to demonstrate
[1:53:46] what a genuine god-built marriage looks
[1:53:50] like
[1:53:51] and
[1:53:52] it is imperative
[1:53:55] that everybody is in their correct role
[1:54:04] when
[1:54:05] world war ii started
[1:54:10] and the men went off to war
[1:54:15] there was nobody in the factories
[1:54:19] but they needed some
[1:54:21] labor in the factories the men were
[1:54:23] overseas fighting
[1:54:25] the women went to work
[1:54:29] when the women went to work the war was
[1:54:31] over the men came back home the women
[1:54:35] did not want to give up that position in
[1:54:37] the workforce
[1:54:39] don't get mad at me
[1:54:42] god has a divine order
[1:54:46] and i know this is 2022.
[1:54:49] but i speak concerning christ in the
[1:54:51] church
[1:54:54] because as we see in the way of the
[1:54:56] natural
[1:54:57] so goes the spiritual
[1:55:01] because when the women
[1:55:04] i'm not
[1:55:05] don't don't throw rocks at me
[1:55:07] giving you history
[1:55:09] when the women went into the workforce
[1:55:13] and the men came home they did not want
[1:55:16] to give up that position
[1:55:20] so you either had both of them working
[1:55:23] or the man became
[1:55:25] dad mom
[1:55:28] stayed at the house
[1:55:30] cook the meals
[1:55:31] whatever
[1:55:34] because the women liked
[1:55:37] the authority that they had
[1:55:40] they liked the paycheck that they got
[1:55:44] nothing against that
[1:55:47] and the way
[1:55:49] that the enemy has pushed society
[1:55:52] it nearly takes both
[1:55:55] for a living in these days
[1:55:58] unless you choose to live really simply
[1:56:04] and most don't want to live really
[1:56:06] simply
[1:56:08] so now the women
[1:56:10] are
[1:56:13] after world war ii
[1:56:15] the women are in the workforce
[1:56:20] and
[1:56:21] they don't want to come back into the
[1:56:23] role of homemaker
[1:56:26] and so it just got worse and worse and
[1:56:28] worse
[1:56:29] now as
[1:56:31] this progressed
[1:56:34] i know this is going to sound like i'm
[1:56:36] bashing women but i'm really not
[1:56:38] i'm trying to
[1:56:41] explain to you concerning christ
[1:56:44] and the church
[1:56:46] and the place that a husband has and a
[1:56:49] place that a wife has
[1:56:52] the bride of christ has a position
[1:56:56] she has a position
[1:56:59] and that position is not to be some
[1:57:01] little push down push over
[1:57:05] this woman
[1:57:06] is called to be a keeper of the home
[1:57:10] to guard
[1:57:12] and protect
[1:57:14] you sitting every one of you sitting
[1:57:16] here today me included you that are
[1:57:18] watching this stream a believer
[1:57:22] when you come into this house
[1:57:24] you have a
[1:57:26] a job
[1:57:28] to be a keeper
[1:57:31] at home
[1:57:33] now again there there's an authority god
[1:57:36] placed a pastor in a position over the
[1:57:39] body
[1:57:40] but all of us are to be watchmen on the
[1:57:42] wall
[1:57:45] you may not have authority to speak into
[1:57:47] every person's life in this building but
[1:57:49] god gave you an authority over your own
[1:57:53] household and your life that you need to
[1:57:56] be a keeper
[1:57:58] you need to watch and guard it
[1:58:01] with everything that's within you
[1:58:04] so now the women are outside of in the
[1:58:06] workforce
[1:58:07] and they're not accomplishing their
[1:58:09] god-given role their order
[1:58:12] in the home
[1:58:14] and now the children
[1:58:17] start becoming delinquent
[1:58:21] because mama
[1:58:23] isn't guarding the whole
[1:58:29] i'm trying to put it in bible
[1:58:30] perspective here
[1:58:34] so as goes the world so goes the church
[1:58:41] now i am a preacher
[1:58:44] who believes
[1:58:48] that women
[1:58:50] do not have a calling
[1:58:53] behind the pulpit
[1:58:56] now
[1:59:00] can have your own opinion
[1:59:02] but i want you to look at the united
[1:59:04] methodist church
[1:59:11] and as the women have come in
[1:59:14] and been given the authority as pastors
[1:59:18] see god placed something in a woman in a
[1:59:20] woman that's sacred
[1:59:23] very sacred
[1:59:25] and there's there's there's something in
[1:59:28] her
[1:59:29] that has a tenderness
[1:59:31] a an ability to love people
[1:59:35] and and that's why a mama can love her
[1:59:38] children no matter how bad they are
[1:59:40] you understand what i'm saying
[1:59:43] so when she is placed in a place of
[1:59:45] authority behind a pulpit
[1:59:49] and she starts seeing sin in
[1:59:52] the people
[1:59:57] and she wants to be real careful how she
[2:00:00] tiptoes around that
[2:00:02] because of what has been placed inside
[2:00:04] of her
[2:00:07] this tenderness
[2:00:09] you know
[2:00:10] we we want to love our children
[2:00:13] we we want to
[2:00:15] make sure that they know they're a part
[2:00:17] of the family
[2:00:19] but this is how sin creeps in the door
[2:00:22] of the church because somebody's out of
[2:00:24] their position
[2:00:26] they're not in a rightful position
[2:00:29] and they begin to get soft on sin
[2:00:32] and then we start legalizing gay
[2:00:34] marriage and then we start legalizing
[2:00:36] this and legalizing and then it comes
[2:00:38] into the church
[2:00:41] and that is why there has to be
[2:00:44] an absolute
[2:00:52] there has to be an absolute
[2:00:56] and if we don't abide by the absolute
[2:01:01] then we find ourselves out of god's
[2:01:05] order
[2:01:06] and we're straying off of the path
[2:01:10] and god cannot continue to reveal the
[2:01:14] mystery to us
[2:01:17] because we've gone off into some pagan
[2:01:20] practice somewhere
[2:01:22] some kind of illicit behavior because
[2:01:26] things got out of order
[2:01:37] god gave away for a parent to correct
[2:01:40] their child
[2:01:44] he placed an authority in their hands
[2:01:48] called the rod of correction
[2:01:52] god placed an authority
[2:01:56] we can read it in the book of romans god
[2:01:58] gave an authority to the governing body
[2:02:03] and a law is put in place
[2:02:06] and if you disobey that law
[2:02:09] in the book of romans it talks about a
[2:02:11] sword
[2:02:12] but there's a way for that law to be
[2:02:14] brought back into
[2:02:16] a a law breaker to be brought back into
[2:02:21] a place of
[2:02:22] abiding by the law or go to jail
[2:02:28] god gave the body of christ
[2:02:32] a way
[2:02:35] to bring his authority into the earth
[2:02:38] and that was when
[2:02:41] he asked
[2:02:43] peter and the disciples who do men say
[2:02:46] that i the son of man am
[2:02:50] and
[2:02:52] they said some say you're elias some say
[2:02:54] you're john the baptist some say this
[2:02:56] some say that but who do you say that i
[2:02:59] am
[2:03:01] thou art the christ
[2:03:03] the son of the living god and then he
[2:03:06] goes on to give the keys to peter and he
[2:03:09] said upon this rock
[2:03:11] i will build my church and the gates of
[2:03:15] hell shall not prevail against it
[2:03:18] whatever you bind on earth shall be
[2:03:21] bound in heaven we know that really that
[2:03:24] should read
[2:03:25] whatever's already been bound on the
[2:03:27] abound in heaven you're going to bring
[2:03:29] it to earth
[2:03:31] that's what we want
[2:03:33] we're not trying to manipulate heaven
[2:03:37] we're trying to bring what is happening
[2:03:39] in the heavenlies down to earth
[2:03:43] we have been given an authority in the
[2:03:46] earth to bring what god has already said
[2:03:48] into the earth
[2:03:51] because he's trying to display his
[2:03:54] character
[2:03:56] his attributes
[2:03:59] and he's trying
[2:04:01] to help you to see
[2:04:04] that he loved
[2:04:08] so much
[2:04:10] that he gave
[2:04:12] his only
[2:04:14] begotten son
[2:04:17] that whosoever believeth in him
[2:04:21] should not perish
[2:04:26] as i said a couple weeks ago
[2:04:29] i like the way kent maddox said it so
[2:04:31] some years ago
[2:04:32] god loves you just the way you are
[2:04:36] but he loves you too much
[2:04:38] to leave you there
[2:04:42] he loves you too much to leave you in
[2:04:44] the condition that you are
[2:04:46] so he made a way for you
[2:04:50] and he is pouring that way out on you
[2:04:55] demonstrating
[2:04:58] through good marriages
[2:05:03] listen to
[2:05:04] me he is demonstrating through good
[2:05:08] marriages
[2:05:09] how that a husband
[2:05:12] would love a wife
[2:05:20] a husband that is not easily provoked
[2:05:24] a husband that doesn't have to always be
[2:05:26] right
[2:05:28] a husband that doesn't have to puff
[2:05:30] himself up all the time to show what a
[2:05:32] great guy he is
[2:05:35] demonstrating through
[2:05:37] a marriage
[2:05:39] this great mystery concerning christ and
[2:05:42] the church
[2:05:43] that he would love so much
[2:05:47] that he would come into the earth
[2:05:50] that he did not remain far removed from
[2:05:54] god's people but he came as a human
[2:05:57] being
[2:05:58] to demonstrate his love to us in that
[2:06:02] while we were yet sinners he died for
[2:06:06] the ungodly
[2:06:08] and so when he died for the ungodly
[2:06:12] we did not yet know him
[2:06:15] but he already died for us
[2:06:17] because he was demonstrating his love
[2:06:21] for us
[2:06:27] he did not
[2:06:31] die for you
[2:06:34] and just hope
[2:06:36] that you got it
[2:06:41] but in this passage of scripture
[2:06:44] he's telling the husbands to love their
[2:06:47] wives and the wives to submit to their
[2:06:50] husbands he's using the natural marriage
[2:06:53] to demonstrate
[2:07:00] and
[2:07:00] a heavenly pattern
[2:07:04] he's using
[2:07:06] marriage
[2:07:08] to
[2:07:08] demonstrate
[2:07:10] that husbands
[2:07:12] don't always have to be right
[2:07:15] they don't have to puff themselves up
[2:07:17] they don't have to uh
[2:07:20] put themselves in such a way where they
[2:07:22] think that everything has got to be
[2:07:24] about them
[2:07:28] now
[2:07:33] you can say it's all about jesus
[2:07:39] and then he'll turn around and say
[2:07:41] it's all about the bride
[2:07:48] he has a
[2:07:49] he has a beautiful
[2:07:52] demonstration that he wants to give to
[2:07:55] his people
[2:07:59] so that
[2:08:01] she recognizes
[2:08:03] that she is in her proper place under
[2:08:05] the headship
[2:08:08] and when
[2:08:10] the woman
[2:08:12] in the home gets out of her
[2:08:14] place
[2:08:16] when she gets out of her place
[2:08:19] and she tries to usurp the authority
[2:08:23] then we have a problem
[2:08:28] see we can go back to the old testament
[2:08:30] and we can talk about how that you have
[2:08:32] the breaking down of
[2:08:35] will the breaking down of society the
[2:08:37] breaking down of a strong leader
[2:08:41] until you get to an ahab
[2:08:46] he wasn't the first bad one
[2:08:50] there were some before him
[2:08:52] solomon had already started taking women
[2:08:55] into his
[2:08:56] life
[2:08:58] and then there were bad kings after him
[2:08:59] but then we got to ahab
[2:09:02] and ahab
[2:09:05] was bad he was bad enough by himself
[2:09:09] then it says
[2:09:11] that
[2:09:12] ahab
[2:09:13] went
[2:09:14] to another country
[2:09:16] and he chose him a jezebel
[2:09:22] and because she was a woman
[2:09:25] who was out of her divine order
[2:09:28] when she came into the kingdom of israel
[2:09:31] with ahab
[2:09:33] because ahab was already a man who would
[2:09:36] not stand up against sin
[2:09:39] he was not a he was ahab was the king
[2:09:42] but he would not stand for righteousness
[2:09:45] and truth and godliness in his kingdom
[2:09:49] so when he chose jezebel to come
[2:09:51] alongside of him
[2:09:54] she was not willing just to be quiet
[2:09:57] queen
[2:10:04] she wanted to run the country
[2:10:08] and we know that she ran the country
[2:10:13] she was the neck that turned the head
[2:10:17] and when
[2:10:18] he didn't turn fast enough
[2:10:22] she went a little higher
[2:10:27] do i need to remind you about nabal's
[2:10:28] vineyard
[2:10:32] because naboth was a man who said this
[2:10:35] is my inheritance and you can't have it
[2:10:39] i don't care if you are the king
[2:10:41] no i'm not trading ground with you
[2:10:44] this is my ground
[2:10:47] and so uh ahab
[2:10:51] pouty ahab
[2:10:53] goes back to his bed and cries the blues
[2:10:56] because that he can't have nabos
[2:10:58] vineyard which the bible says was right
[2:11:00] next to ahab's house
[2:11:05] jezebel comes in and starts patting him
[2:11:08] what's the matter baby
[2:11:10] what's the matter with you why are you
[2:11:12] crying
[2:11:15] nate balls won't let me have his
[2:11:16] vineyard
[2:11:20] you just stay right there and cry a
[2:11:22] while longer i'll handle things for you
[2:11:27] out of god's divine order
[2:11:30] ahab was the man that was the trouble
[2:11:36] husbands
[2:11:39] love your wives
[2:11:41] even as christ
[2:11:43] loved the church and gave himself for it
[2:11:47] that he might present it to himself a
[2:11:49] glorious
[2:11:50] church not having spot
[2:11:54] or wrinkle or any such thing but at that
[2:11:57] should be holy and without blemish
[2:12:00] i said this some time ago
[2:12:03] i heard another preacher say it
[2:12:05] husbands
[2:12:07] you don't like what you get out of your
[2:12:08] wife
[2:12:12] your fault
[2:12:21] because you don't love them
[2:12:23] the way christ loved the church
[2:12:27] he said he loved the church
[2:12:32] and gave himself for it
[2:12:34] so that he could sanctify and cleanse it
[2:12:37] with the washing of water by the word
[2:12:40] so that he could present it to himself
[2:12:44] a glorious church
[2:12:48] husbands
[2:12:50] love your wives
[2:12:52] as christ loved the church
[2:12:56] wives
[2:12:58] submit to your own husbands as unto the
[2:13:01] lord
[2:13:03] church
[2:13:05] submit under the authority that god
[2:13:07] placed in your midst
[2:13:12] pastor
[2:13:14] submit under the lordship
[2:13:17] of jesus christ
[2:13:19] and i believe that he does
[2:13:22] i believe that he is submitting himself
[2:13:25] under the headship the leadership of the
[2:13:27] holy ghost and everything has to be in
[2:13:30] god's divine order this is what this is
[2:13:32] about god's divine order
[2:13:35] this is not just
[2:13:36] good marriages and husbands and what
[2:13:38] this is about god's divine order
[2:13:41] because god does everything in order god
[2:13:44] is not a god of chaos
[2:13:46] so we've heard preached around here
[2:13:48] back in in the book of genesis when
[2:13:51] everything looked uh
[2:13:53] null it looked void it looked dark and
[2:13:56] that's not the way god creates things
[2:14:00] god is a creator of perfection he's
[2:14:04] meticulous in everything that he does
[2:14:05] he's a god of order
[2:14:08] and as he presents he puts things in
[2:14:10] divine order then he brought it in after
[2:14:13] he after things were made and he had
[2:14:15] this man and then the woman he wanted
[2:14:18] them to be in divine order
[2:14:22] and from the very beginning he puts
[2:14:24] things in this divine order
[2:14:26] but then
[2:14:27] the enemy wants to shift things out of
[2:14:29] order
[2:14:32] because as long as the enemy can get
[2:14:34] things out of order
[2:14:38] and he can keep chaos
[2:14:40] in your heart
[2:14:42] and in your mind
[2:14:44] then you are not allowing this continual
[2:14:48] mystery this great mystery or this
[2:14:50] continual revelation you are not
[2:14:52] allowing it to come to its full and
[2:14:55] complete picture
[2:14:58] but by the
[2:14:59] power of the holy ghost
[2:15:01] you see
[2:15:03] when god gives you the holy ghost
[2:15:06] he gives you the holy ghost to guide you
[2:15:08] into all truth
[2:15:11] he wants truth to be at the forefront of
[2:15:13] everything that you do
[2:15:15] he does not want you to go off into
[2:15:17] error so he puts truth right in your
[2:15:20] path
[2:15:22] he still gives you
[2:15:24] as a human being
[2:15:26] with free choice
[2:15:27] he gives you the opportunity to make the
[2:15:30] choice do i want this as my truth
[2:15:37] i don't care what your truth is
[2:15:39] there is truth
[2:15:43] jesus is the way
[2:15:45] and the truth
[2:15:46] and the life
[2:15:48] so as he puts truth in front of you he
[2:15:51] gives you a choice to choose truth
[2:15:55] or to be out of order
[2:15:59] there's i mean there's only two ways
[2:16:00] about it
[2:16:04] or disorder
[2:16:07] so then as you choose order
[2:16:09] and you step into that order
[2:16:12] then god comes
[2:16:14] and he takes the word
[2:16:16] you get that you get that
[2:16:20] initial
[2:16:22] ecstasy
[2:16:23] of the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:16:26] and there are times that ecstasy of the
[2:16:29] holy ghost comes upon you but you don't
[2:16:31] live in that ecstasy 100 of the time
[2:16:36] if we've ever given that impression i'm
[2:16:38] sorry
[2:16:41] because every day you're fighting
[2:16:43] battles
[2:16:45] and every day
[2:16:47] there is
[2:16:48] a
[2:16:49] there is a a battle
[2:16:52] of whether you're going to have
[2:16:54] communion with your lord or not
[2:17:02] this is a great mystery
[2:17:04] laying marriage out
[2:17:06] but i speak concerning christ in the
[2:17:08] church
[2:17:11] there's ecstasy in marriage
[2:17:15] but it's not 24 7.
[2:17:21] and when the ecstasy fades away
[2:17:24] comes and it goes
[2:17:28] try to stay g-rated here
[2:17:30] as it comes and it goes in a marriage
[2:17:34] but there still has to be communion
[2:17:37] between a man and a wife
[2:17:41] day to day
[2:17:44] some highs some lows
[2:17:47] but i speak concerning christ in the
[2:17:49] church
[2:17:52] so there is a there is a
[2:17:56] a buzz that comes there
[2:17:58] when the spirit of god comes upon you
[2:18:02] there is an ecstasy an excitement a
[2:18:05] just a
[2:18:12] something you don't know what to do with
[2:18:14] because it's supernatural
[2:18:18] supernatural
[2:18:23] and i want and desire as you do
[2:18:27] to live more of my life
[2:18:29] above the natural
[2:18:36] and the way that that's going to happen
[2:18:38] is i've got to have sweet communion with
[2:18:40] him
[2:18:43] when i don't feel the excitement like i
[2:18:46] did
[2:18:48] at church
[2:18:51] when i don't feel the high
[2:18:54] that i have felt
[2:18:58] i still
[2:19:00] have to have communion with him
[2:19:04] because he has taken the word
[2:19:07] and he is washing me
[2:19:10] cleansing me
[2:19:12] letting the word wash over me and over
[2:19:15] me and over me those words that i have
[2:19:17] heard for years prior and and maybe they
[2:19:20] just bounced off of me and i had no
[2:19:22] understanding of them and he comes
[2:19:23] around and he takes that same word and
[2:19:25] he watches me again
[2:19:28] this time i'm ready to receive this time
[2:19:30] i'm ready to get it this time my mind
[2:19:33] and my i have a whole new mindset
[2:19:36] because i've been hearing the preaching
[2:19:38] of the word and it's brought me into a
[2:19:41] whole different mindset and now i let
[2:19:43] that word wash over me and it
[2:19:47] washes another layer off of me why is
[2:19:50] that because
[2:19:51] i am one of those that he is going to
[2:19:55] present to himself as a glorious church
[2:20:00] without spot
[2:20:02] wrinkle
[2:20:04] anything
[2:20:05] it's going to be that he is presenting a
[2:20:08] perfect lady to himself
[2:20:12] and he's using
[2:20:13] marriage in this chapter he's using
[2:20:15] marriage to demonstrate in a natural
[2:20:18] something that is supernatural
[2:20:21] and so as he's washing us in his word
[2:20:24] he's letting these things go over us
[2:20:26] over us over us
[2:20:29] because he wants to present to himself
[2:20:31] this glorious church
[2:20:34] would you stand together with me today
[2:20:50] i try to
[2:20:53] stay in the
[2:20:54] uh
[2:20:57] in the scripture
[2:20:59] and not give my own ideas
[2:21:03] and as god
[2:21:04] unveils himself more and more
[2:21:07] with his word
[2:21:09] musicians can come
[2:21:11] please
[2:21:13] as god unveils himself more and more to
[2:21:16] us
[2:21:20] he is
[2:21:22] causing
[2:21:24] the body of christ
[2:21:29] it's it's not just about husbands and
[2:21:31] wives but it's about every person in the
[2:21:34] body of christ
[2:21:36] so
[2:21:39] yielding themselves dropping their own
[2:21:41] ideas their own
[2:21:44] intellect
[2:21:47] to drop it
[2:21:50] and say i don't have to have my way
[2:21:57] when we as a church body
[2:22:01] there is divine order as i said a few
[2:22:03] minutes ago there's divine order in the
[2:22:04] way that god
[2:22:06] puts authority in our life
[2:22:09] there's this divine order
[2:22:12] and god is desiring that each one of us
[2:22:14] walk in this divine order
[2:22:19] and so yield ourselves one to another
[2:22:23] preferring one another
[2:22:28] and it's going to take this love that
[2:22:30] i've read about
[2:22:33] it's going to take that love for us to
[2:22:35] prefer one another
[2:22:37] because human nature is
[2:22:40] we want to be
[2:22:43] top dog
[2:22:46] we want to be at the forefront we want
[2:22:48] to be noticed
[2:22:52] human nature is
[2:22:54] that we're easily provoked
[2:22:57] because we're all out here
[2:22:59] working in satan's eating all you know
[2:23:01] dealing with all the pressures of life
[2:23:04] these things come at us
[2:23:05] and we react so hastily so quickly
[2:23:13] but we need to
[2:23:15] yield to one another
[2:23:21] let me tell you how you start
[2:23:29] heard somebody say it last night i'll
[2:23:32] tell you how you start
[2:23:36] when you come
[2:23:38] to an intersection
[2:23:42] you see that sign that says yield
[2:23:47] and you don't really want to yield
[2:23:51] and you got time to go
[2:23:54] barely
[2:23:58] yield
[2:24:00] yield
[2:24:04] preacher you are being so simplistic
[2:24:07] no
[2:24:10] because
[2:24:11] that
[2:24:13] is just one little thing in life
[2:24:19] and then we carry our in a hurry
[2:24:24] to the next part
[2:24:26] and to the next part and to the next
[2:24:28] part
[2:24:30] and we never yield to anybody
[2:24:35] we never
[2:24:38] prefer anybody because it's always about
[2:24:41] i gotta get there
[2:24:43] i gotta i gotta
[2:24:46] yield
[2:24:48] yield
[2:24:50] jesus use me
[2:24:52] lord don't refuse me
[2:24:57] jesus use me
[2:25:02] oh lord
[2:25:04] don't refuse me
[2:25:08] sure
[2:25:10] there's no work
[2:25:13] that i
[2:25:14] can do
[2:25:20] and even
[2:25:23] [Music]
[2:25:28] [Music]
[2:25:34] and though
[2:25:36] the cost
[2:25:37] be great i'll work
[2:25:41] for you
[2:25:42] just a little faster
[2:25:46] oh
[2:25:49] jesus excuse me
[2:25:53] and o lord don't
[2:25:56] refuse me
[2:26:01] surely there's a word that i
[2:26:06] can do
[2:26:12] and even though
[2:26:16] it's
[2:26:18] lord
[2:26:25] and though
[2:26:27] the cost
[2:26:28] be great i'll work for you
[2:26:37] he's the lily
[2:26:40] of

[2:26:58] my soul

[2:27:35] [Music]
[2:27:37] oh lord don't
[2:27:40] refuse me

[2:27:48] [Music]
[2:27:55] and even though
[2:27:59] it's um

[2:28:22] if you're in this place there's already
[2:28:24] some that are standing around the front
[2:28:27] but perhaps you would
[2:28:30] see some things that are in your life
[2:28:32] that
[2:28:33] are out of order
[2:28:36] it doesn't matter what they are
[2:28:38] we're not going to try to put names on
[2:28:40] them
[2:28:43] but if you would see that there's some
[2:28:44] things that are out of order in your
[2:28:46] life i want to give you the opportunity
[2:28:49] to come and join us around the front of
[2:28:50] this building today
[2:28:52] we're just going to have a corporate
[2:28:53] prayer
[2:28:56] because we want our lives to be in god's
[2:28:59] divine order
[2:29:01] we want everything about us
[2:29:04] to know that we are subjecting ourselves
[2:29:06] ourselves our life our will our emotions
[2:29:10] even
[2:29:11] to the will of god
[2:29:13] and if you find yourself today
[2:29:16] you would just say
[2:29:17] you know there's some things that aren't
[2:29:19] quite in order in my life i want to
[2:29:21] invite you to come and stand around the
[2:29:22] front with the rest of these
[2:29:29] surely there's a work
[2:29:34] that i can do
[2:29:41] and
[2:29:43] even though it's some more
[2:29:50] [Music]
[2:29:56] [Music]

[2:30:02] for you he's the lily of the valley

[2:30:10] of
[2:30:12] the valley

[2:30:18] morning star

[2:31:11] refuse me
[2:31:16] surely there's a word that i can do
[2:31:26] [Music]
[2:31:38] took
[2:31:42] [Music]
[2:31:52] father as we are gathered around the
[2:31:54] front of this auditorium
[2:31:58] none of us better than the next
[2:32:02] we just have come
[2:32:05] presenting ourselves before the living
[2:32:08] god
[2:32:10] we realize lord that
[2:32:14] our salvation is secure and we're
[2:32:16] grateful for that today
[2:32:19] i want to thank you
[2:32:21] that you have given us the baptism of
[2:32:24] the holy ghost to guide us into all
[2:32:26] truth
[2:32:28] and because that we have that guide
[2:32:31] it helps us to recognize when things are
[2:32:33] not
[2:32:34] in divine order
[2:32:36] in our lives
[2:32:38] so we've come presenting ourselves lord
[2:32:42] and asking for your help
[2:32:44] lord i would venture to say that
[2:32:49] standing around the front of this place
[2:32:51] there are all sorts
[2:32:53] of thought
[2:32:55] about what the disorder is in their
[2:32:57] lives
[2:32:59] one differing from the other
[2:33:02] but by your spirit you have helped us to
[2:33:04] recognize
[2:33:06] that there is not that divine order that
[2:33:08] we long for
[2:33:10] and so we come presenting ourselves
[2:33:12] before you
[2:33:13] asking you holy spirit
[2:33:16] that you will
[2:33:18] by the power of the blood of jesus
[2:33:21] christ
[2:33:22] you will cleanse us from all the
[2:33:24] disorder
[2:33:26] from all of the things that have us hung
[2:33:28] up
[2:33:29] and that you will
[2:33:31] cleanse
[2:33:32] completely
[2:33:35] and bring the divine order in our lives
[2:33:43] my god
[2:33:47] my god
[2:33:50] my god
[2:33:53] you see it lord
[2:33:56] you see the chaos of minds
[2:34:01] you see that thing that keeps whirling
[2:34:03] around and around and around and around
[2:34:06] and around
[2:34:11] but god i'm calling on you right now
[2:34:14] by the delivering power of the holy
[2:34:16] spirit
[2:34:19] to cleanse
[2:34:22] cleanse lord
[2:34:25] we give it to you
[2:34:30] i'm not my own
[2:34:33] i'm under the headship of the lord jesus
[2:34:35] christ
[2:34:39] and under that headship lord i realize
[2:34:42] that
[2:34:43] the word is all that matters
[2:34:47] i have got to be washed
[2:34:50] in the water
[2:34:51] of the word
[2:34:57] and when i find myself in error to the
[2:35:00] word
[2:35:01] i run quickly
[2:35:05] let the word cleanse us today oh lord
[2:35:09] in the quietness of this service
[2:35:17] as men and women are standing here in a
[2:35:20] sober moment
[2:35:25] i ask you
[2:35:28] that you would
[2:35:31] show
[2:35:33] the way
[2:35:35] the word
[2:35:37] of how to come
[2:35:39] in agreement
[2:35:41] in divine order
[2:35:44] where there is no order
[2:35:46] or where there is lack of order
[2:35:52] god i thank you that you heal marriages
[2:35:57] i thank you that you heal families
[2:36:00] i thank you that you cause
