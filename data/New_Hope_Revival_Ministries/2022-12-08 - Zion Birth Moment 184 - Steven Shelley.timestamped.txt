[0:00] the sons of God are birth out of Zion so
[0:04] Zion is more than a place
[0:08] Zion is a people
[0:11] and Zion people they come about by a
[0:15] Zion birth
[0:23] there is a repositioning
[0:27] that has to take place when we recognize
[0:31] that God is squeezing us
[0:33] you know I like to stroll from season to
[0:37] season
[0:40] I like to walk out of my trials
[0:45] but I right into my blessings
[0:48] but how many of you know you don't
[0:49] always change dimensions and seasons
[0:53] threatened
[0:58] sometimes it's my contractions
[1:07] okay
[1:10] you know I saw once envisioned Mount
[1:13] Zion
[1:14] in birth pains
[1:18] Contracting like a woman giving birth
[1:22] because it is out of oh
[1:26] because it is out of Zion that sons are
[1:29] born
[1:30] the sons of God are birthed out of Zion
[1:35] so Zion is more than a place
[1:39] Zion is a people
[1:42] and Zion people they come about by Zion
[1:46] birth
[1:48] and sometimes the squeeze is how we get
[1:52] from one season to the next and there's
[1:54] nothing dignified
[1:58] it's messy
[2:00] and you're not gonna always stroll from
[2:03] one spiritual season to the next
[2:05] sometimes
[2:08] you're going to be squeezed out
[2:11] and sometimes you're going to walk into
[2:13] your new season with a cone-shaped head
[2:17] because things get a little tight in
[2:21] there
[2:23] how many of you have ever had a season
[2:25] where you it was getting a little tied
[2:28] in the air
[2:32] somebody said 2020 was like that
[2:36] and then 2021 came and they said 2021
[2:39] that was it that was the year from you
[2:41] nowhere
[2:42] and then 2022 came and they're saying
[2:45] the same thing and the truth is none of
[2:49] them were hideous or horrible or from
[2:52] hell they were all from heaven
[2:55] they just did not smell the same they
[2:58] don't all look the same because in God
[3:00] their Ebbs and flows in seasons and
[3:03] cycles and come on
[3:06] all of this for a purpose because there
[3:09] are virtues
[3:13] that's more than Thunders by the way
[3:16] virtues
[3:19] that we are climbing
[3:21] and the and the word of the Lord came
[3:23] and said you're gonna get it by births
[3:25] you're gonna get them by birth you're
[3:28] not going to get them by them dropping
[3:30] down on your head you're going to get
[3:32] them by being birthed from one virtue
[3:35] into another virtue into another virtue
[3:38] as you begin to climb the stature up
[3:41] into climb up into the stature of the
[3:45] perfect man
[3:46] it's the perfect man it's his stature
[3:51] that we're climbing into and the perfect
[3:54] man was John 1 in the beginning was the
[3:56] word the word became flesh and the Word
[3:58] was God
