[46:40] [Music]
[46:43] don't know or you've never had the
[46:46] chance to hear just where I've been to
[46:50] know where I came from cause if you'd
[46:53] seen the chains I wore and how heavy
[46:56] they were then you might understand why
[47:00] I act the way I do cause if you'd been
[47:04] there when you found me it was
[47:08] all praise came to rescue me from my
[47:12] life of sin I know what it feels like to
[47:16] be bound up in Chains
[47:19] now I appreciate what freedom feels like
[47:23] that's why let's watch out why I can't
[47:26] why I pray
[47:28] [Music]
[47:31] is
[47:35] [Music]
[47:39] Jesus Paid the price so I didn't have to
[47:43] stay lost
[47:49] that's why
[47:51] that's why I praise
[47:54] [Music]
[48:04] my whole life changed the day that Jesus
[48:07] walked in who gave me Beauty for Ashes
[48:12] [Music]
[48:31] like I do
[48:33] I do cause he who the sun sets free is
[48:39] [Music]
[48:43] purchases
[48:43] [Music]
[49:01] it's been said about our praise that
[49:04] it's disgraceful distasteful said about
[49:07] our praise
[49:10] [Music]
[49:13] you've never had the chance
[49:18] [Music]
[49:35] praise came to rescue me from my life of
[49:39] sin I know what it feels like to be
[49:43] bound up in Chains so now I appreciate
[49:47] what freedom feels like that's why I
[49:50] shout why I dance
[49:53] [Music]
[50:01] [Music]
[50:05] so I didn't have to stay lost
[50:12] [Music]
[50:19] [Music]
[50:33] [Music]
[50:50] like I do
[50:53] [Music]
[51:10] well Glory
[51:16] [Music]
[51:25] [Applause]
[51:35] you may be seated isn't he wonderful
[51:38] isn't he worthy of radical exuberant
[51:41] praise
[51:43] amen did you write that Ashley this week
[51:46] or you've been working on it two two
[51:48] weeks ago let's thank God again
[51:51] [Applause]
[51:53] [Music]
[51:57] she's writing music to Chronicle what
[52:00] God's doing in this hour isn't that a
[52:02] blessing
[52:04] she must have been reading Instagram
[52:08] because they're what one man said one
[52:11] man this week he said well they have to
[52:12] act like that because they don't have
[52:14] truth
[52:15] and I thought well I'm going to check
[52:16] you out dude I'm going to see what you
[52:20] believe he was a Jehovah's Witness
[52:27] yes have mercy God
[52:30] and uh oh we get all kinds of comments
[52:33] and Anna Christine is busy it's almost a
[52:36] 40 hour a week job keeping up with all
[52:38] the comments some if they're real
[52:41] distasteful we take them off but like I
[52:44] told her yesterday I'm really enjoying
[52:45] this
[52:48] and and every day I get notifications so
[52:51] and so so and so followed you because of
[52:53] the real
[52:54] so and so followed you from the real so
[52:57] and so followed you from the real so
[52:58] there are people who who maybe they
[53:01] subscribe just to laugh at us
[53:03] I don't know but maybe God will get a
[53:06] hold of some of his heart and there are
[53:08] some people that we don't ever defend
[53:10] I'm not going to tell you that I won't
[53:12] but so far I've been very very careful
[53:15] made very few comments back but we don't
[53:17] always have to because there are plenty
[53:19] of people who take offense
[53:21] and and they get on there and say you've
[53:24] just never been you've just never been
[53:25] in that kind of sit you've just never
[53:26] been in that atmosphere and etc etc so
[53:29] we give God the praise we don't feel
[53:31] sorry for ourselves
[53:33] but I will tell you this if you see that
[53:36] a real has gone up and one of these
[53:38] singers is involved you should use that
[53:41] as a Target to remember to pray for them
[53:44] because just the fact that their faces
[53:47] and their songs are being put out in the
[53:50] public sturge Warfare against them in
[53:53] the spirit
[53:55] and so you when you see it if whoever it
[53:57] is if it's sister Jai or brother Josh or
[54:00] or sister Megan she really is getting it
[54:03] lately uh or or this week they posted
[54:06] the the quartet there singing on four of
[54:09] them and whoever it is if you see it you
[54:12] see their picture you say oh God cover
[54:14] them by the blood of Jesus and raise up
[54:18] a standard against the enemy that would
[54:21] war against them you may not recognize
[54:24] it but there are witches there are
[54:26] warlocks there are all kinds of people
[54:29] in dark magic and dark witchcraft who
[54:32] see something like that and they they
[54:33] try they practice they practice with
[54:36] spells they practice with curses but we
[54:39] just say that no curse can stick on a
[54:43] child of God if there's no cause if
[54:46] you're being cursed and there's no cause
[54:48] for the curse it can't stand in the
[54:50] blood of Jesus it can never stand and I
[54:53] know that sometimes people don't take it
[54:55] quite serious enough but it's a serious
[54:58] matter and uh well I guess my face is
[55:02] out there quite a few times in the
[55:04] course of a week so I hope you'll pray
[55:06] for me and my family I want to thank you
[55:08] for praying for Stacy she is here you do
[55:11] not have to hug her she won't her have
[55:13] her feelings hurt uh you don't have to
[55:16] get near her if you don't want to but
[55:18] she according to her doctor she was five
[55:20] days in quarantine this uh strain is
[55:24] affecting people quite differently and
[55:26] they are saying that five days after
[55:28] symptoms show up it is no longer
[55:30] contagious and I will tell you on her
[55:34] behalf you don't want it
[55:36] you don't want it and I know that it's
[55:38] affecting people different ways she
[55:40] never had a cough she never had
[55:42] congestion she never had sinus issues
[55:44] but she was four days in the bed with an
[55:48] excruciating headache and extreme nausea
[55:51] those were mostly the only symptoms that
[55:54] she had and uh we've been married a long
[55:57] time now and I've never seen her quite
[56:00] that sick unable to move unable to get
[56:03] up hardly and it's the grace of God to
[56:08] touch her the way he has and she did
[56:11] test positive and uh after that they
[56:14] were giving her a little something for
[56:16] nausea there's nothing else that they
[56:17] can do you are probably safer at church
[56:20] than you are at the grocery store so if
[56:23] you've been at the grocery store this
[56:24] week you might notice the mass coming
[56:26] back on I saw people I was at home from
[56:30] Sunday after lunch until Friday never
[56:33] left the house stayed close I was in
[56:37] quarantine in one end of the house
[56:39] because I didn't really want to get it
[56:41] she was in quarantine and the other I've
[56:43] slept on an air mattress every night
[56:45] this week so you can you can hug me if
[56:47] you want to if you don't some of you
[56:50] don't anyway so I won't I won't be too
[56:52] offended
[56:54] I'll just assume you didn't like the
[56:56] preaching or something I don't know but
[56:58] if we didn't feel like that it was safe
[57:00] for her to be here and safe for you for
[57:03] her to be here she wouldn't be here
[57:04] today we're we're some of the most
[57:06] cautious people here we're not fearful
[57:09] before there was a covid uh we we came
[57:12] with fevers
[57:14] my children came to church the whole
[57:16] time they were growing up with fevers we
[57:18] just figured God was on the throne and
[57:20] he was taking care of it but then covet
[57:22] comes along and it makes us aware uh we
[57:25] didn't have church Tuesday night because
[57:27] we didn't know who else in our family
[57:30] would get it if it would spread if we
[57:32] would bring it to church and so it's
[57:34] been a long week amen
[57:37] but we're just thankful I'm telling you
[57:39] God performed a miracle for her to be
[57:41] able to even be here today and uh there
[57:45] was no improvement until Friday and and
[57:47] then the Improvement started so uh let's
[57:50] be careful let's wash our hands let's do
[57:52] all the things that we know to do but uh
[57:54] unless you feel it necessary please
[57:56] don't don't be one of those who has to
[57:59] drive around town in a car by yourself
[58:01] with a mask
[58:04] really
[58:06] Friday I got out for the first time and
[58:08] and I saw people and I'm thinking I I
[58:11] would smother
[58:13] in my own vehicle no one else in my
[58:15] vehicle with a mask on and pull it down
[58:18] it breathe enjoy air while you can if
[58:22] you want to wear it around people then
[58:23] that's your business but but God is so
[58:26] good you could feel that fear creeping
[58:28] up I could feel it creeping up as I the
[58:31] one day I was out on Friday I could feel
[58:33] it creeping up in the atmosphere and
[58:36] fear does nothing except invite trouble
[58:40] it's a magnet Faith always gets the job
[58:44] done do you believe that
[58:47] so we have a real host I know there are
[58:50] quite a few people out today some are
[58:52] traveling some will be traveling next
[58:54] weekend we have camp meeting coming up
[58:56] in October 3rd through the 7th I believe
[58:58] are the dates and we want you to be
[59:00] praying already for that Brother Juan
[59:03] arnoldus from South Africa will be
[59:06] coming with his wife uh if you want to
[59:09] check his ministry out it's bride's
[59:11] Revival Ministry and we have been
[59:15] acquainted through letters through
[59:18] through uh messenger through through
[59:21] emails now for over 20 years and it has
[59:25] been their dream to come this week after
[59:28] I heard a few weeks ago that he was
[59:30] coming and I've been praying about their
[59:33] coming excited about their coming we
[59:35] were praying about it and we feel led of
[59:37] the Lord to invite him to minister to us
[59:39] while he's here so we sent the
[59:42] invitation and he graciously accepted I
[59:45] send the invitation like I do uh always
[59:48] you we would very much like for you to
[59:51] come we don't want to cause you any
[59:52] trouble our church is very criticized we
[59:55] don't want we don't want there to be any
[59:57] any uh you know problem for you by
[1:00:00] association and uh but the the fact is
[1:00:03] we're we're Associated already
[1:00:06] we're already in the same Club the
[1:00:09] freedom Club
[1:00:11] like Ashley was singing about just a
[1:00:13] minute ago and so he has graciously
[1:00:15] accepted and he'll be doing some
[1:00:17] speaking for us during camp meeting
[1:00:19] unfortunately brother Brooks will not be
[1:00:21] able to come he pastors two churches and
[1:00:24] travels all the time and he just
[1:00:27] couldn't get an extra weekend away but I
[1:00:29] have invited him for the next two one of
[1:00:32] the two whichever he can come for are
[1:00:34] our fellowship meetings after camp
[1:00:36] meeting either either by the end of the
[1:00:38] year the first of next year and he has
[1:00:40] said I absolutely want to do that so
[1:00:43] there's nothing wrong in our fellowship
[1:00:45] I heard from him this morning again and
[1:00:47] we're in very much very good Fellowship
[1:00:49] but God knows I'm not I'm not even
[1:00:52] concerned or worried I just prayed a
[1:00:55] couple weeks now before inviting brother
[1:00:57] arnoldus to come and and to do some he
[1:01:00] was coming anyway
[1:01:01] and and you know that means something to
[1:01:03] me and I trust him and I think you'll be
[1:01:06] blessed by his ministry and whoever else
[1:01:08] the Lord provides but we have a lot of

[1:04:05] it's also uh brother brother Josh and
[1:04:09] sister hope Alano's anniversary how many
[1:04:11] how many years is this six years happy
[1:04:15] anniversary to them
[1:04:18] [Applause]
[1:04:19] when I finish baptizing last Sunday and
[1:04:22] went in and we changed and said goodbye
[1:04:25] to Sister Flo and to brother Trey and
[1:04:28] his wife Autumn I want to say this to
[1:04:32] thank you all for coming we just
[1:04:34] mentioned there at the end if a few of
[1:04:36] you wanted to come and I thought well
[1:04:38] there won't be very many they don't know
[1:04:40] him and and and there won't be many come
[1:04:42] I was so I was so blessed uh at how many
[1:04:46] came thank you all I appreciated that
[1:04:49] didn't you sister Flo we had a crowd in
[1:04:51] the backyard and I appreciated that
[1:04:53] because their baptism is just as
[1:04:55] important as anybody else's baptism and
[1:04:58] I know you people didn't know them but
[1:04:59] the thought that you would come and
[1:05:01] celebrate uh something that took well
[1:05:03] almost 30 years to to come to fruition
[1:05:06] because he he had said as you heard last
[1:05:09] weekend to Sister Flo when I when I get
[1:05:12] old enough to do what I want to do about
[1:05:14] it because he was his family certainly
[1:05:16] wasn't for baptism in the name of the
[1:05:18] Lord Jesus Christ he said I want your
[1:05:20] preacher to baptize me and so it took a
[1:05:24] few years for that to come around but it
[1:05:26] has come around and we were blessed to
[1:05:28] baptize him so after that was over I had
[1:05:31] a cute little card handed to me and I
[1:05:34] regretted that I I didn't get it while I
[1:05:37] could see them but got it later but it's
[1:05:39] the cutest little card here
[1:05:42] and a little design on the bottom like a
[1:05:45] ultrasound I don't know if that's a real
[1:05:46] ultrasound or not but kind of like that
[1:05:49] and and and in childlike uh font I want
[1:05:54] to read it to you it says brother Shelly
[1:05:57] pleased with the Z
[1:06:00] please pray for us we ask Jesus for a
[1:06:04] Dino and a Truck

[1:13:01] please the Hebrews chapter 4.
[1:13:05] verse 11 and 12 is where we will start
[1:13:08] this morning in our study together
[1:13:12] Hallelujah
[1:13:21] let us labor
[1:13:24] therefore
[1:13:26] to enter into
[1:13:29] that rest
[1:13:32] lest any man fall
[1:13:35] after the same example of unbelief
[1:13:40] for the word of God is quick
[1:13:43] and powerful and sharper than any
[1:13:47] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[1:13:51] dividing asunder of what Soul and Spirit
[1:13:54] and of the joints and Marrow and is a
[1:13:59] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:14:03] the heart can you say Amen let's take
[1:14:06] that in the Amplified and then we'll
[1:14:08] have our seats again
[1:14:10] let us therefore be zealous
[1:14:13] and exert ourselves and strive
[1:14:17] diligently to enter that rest of God to
[1:14:23] know and experience it
[1:14:27] for ourselves that no one may fall or
[1:14:31] perish by the same kind of unbelief and
[1:14:35] Disobedience into which those in the
[1:14:39] wilderness fell for the word that God
[1:14:43] speaks this is so powerful
[1:14:46] for the word that God speaks is alive
[1:14:49] and full of power making it active
[1:14:54] operative
[1:14:55] energizing and what effective
[1:14:59] it is sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:15:04] penetrating to the dividing line of the
[1:15:08] Breath of Life Soul and the immortal
[1:15:11] spirit and of joints and Marrow of the
[1:15:16] deepest parts of our nature
[1:15:19] exposing and sifting and analyzing and
[1:15:25] judging the very thoughts and purposes
[1:15:29] or intentions of the heart
[1:15:33] father we thank you today for another
[1:15:37] opportunity to celebrate who you are in
[1:15:42] our lives
[1:15:43] we are under the Revelation that we must
[1:15:48] know both who and what we are in this
[1:15:53] hour
[1:15:54] it is impossible for us to be
[1:15:57] positionally placed in the Kingdom
[1:16:00] Affairs without knowing who and what we
[1:16:05] are so today Lord may your word be
[1:16:09] active may your word be operative may
[1:16:14] your word be energizing and may it be
[1:16:18] effective to us
[1:16:20] personally
[1:16:22] individually may your word divide
[1:16:26] penetrating the very Soul the breath of
[1:16:30] life and the immortal Spirit May It Go
[1:16:34] deeply into the deepest recesses of our
[1:16:39] nature may it Expose and sift and
[1:16:43] analyze and judge our very thoughts and
[1:16:47] purposes and intentions of the heart we
[1:16:52] as a body of Believers surrender to the
[1:16:55] authority of your word
[1:16:57] turn the sword of your word the
[1:17:01] two-edged sword of your word in our
[1:17:04] direction we pray today and may we
[1:17:07] actively participate not with just our
[1:17:10] amen but may we put our faith on the
[1:17:14] line May there be something in every
[1:17:17] cell of our body that responds to that
[1:17:21] word may we like Mary say to you today
[1:17:25] be it unto me according to Thy word have
[1:17:31] your will and weigh in my life we ask
[1:17:36] this in the matchless and mighty name of
[1:17:40] the Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory
[1:17:43] we pray and the church said
[1:17:46] amen you may be seated we're continuing
[1:17:50] with the sword the labor and the rest
[1:17:54] when we focus for a moment on these
[1:17:58] passages of scripture there is something
[1:18:01] that sounds rather contradictory
[1:18:04] it seems that we must labor to find rest
[1:18:09] that goes against everything that we
[1:18:12] understand about both labor and about
[1:18:17] rest we perceive rest as the opposite of
[1:18:22] labor but the Apostle Paul did not teach
[1:18:25] us that rest is the opposite of labor
[1:18:28] labor is something necessary and it is
[1:18:32] not physical exertion that the apostle
[1:18:35] was talking about he's talking about a
[1:18:38] spiritual demonstration he's talking
[1:18:41] about not what we do with our hands or
[1:18:44] even what we do with our brain he's
[1:18:46] talking about what we do with our inner
[1:18:49] man we put our Inner Man in when the
[1:18:53] word is going forth and we hold it
[1:18:56] before the Lord and we say Do by your
[1:18:59] word for me and in me what I cannot do
[1:19:03] for myself
[1:19:04] I am convinced today church that if we
[1:19:07] could perfect ourselves we would already
[1:19:09] have been raptured out of here if we
[1:19:11] could improve ourselves spiritually on
[1:19:14] our own with our own willpower we would
[1:19:17] have probably already been out of here
[1:19:19] but it's an it's an impossibility it is
[1:19:22] futile to try by striving this labor is
[1:19:26] not about striving this labor is about
[1:19:29] spiritual work there's a difference in
[1:19:32] physical work and spiritual work it
[1:19:35] requires spiritual discipline and if
[1:19:38] you're not a disciplined person in the
[1:19:40] natural you'll struggle more than anyone
[1:19:43] else to be spiritually disciplined
[1:19:45] remember it is not how much reading you
[1:19:48] do it is not how how many religious
[1:19:51] things you do it's about what you do
[1:19:54] from your spirit man it's not what you
[1:19:57] do as an act of your will only that
[1:19:59] we're talking about we're talking about
[1:20:01] something spiritual a transaction action
[1:20:04] that is spiritual that must take place
[1:20:07] between you and the word how many of you
[1:20:09] think you understand that so it's not
[1:20:11] just reading the Bible
[1:20:13] it's not just hearing the preaching
[1:20:15] it's about how we hear
[1:20:18] you see he didn't just tell us to be
[1:20:20] careful what we hear he tells us to be
[1:20:22] careful
[1:20:23] how we hear and what Jesus is talking
[1:20:26] about in that verse is you must do your
[1:20:29] part as the word is going forth
[1:20:32] you must participate actively with your
[1:20:35] spirit man and I described just a moment
[1:20:38] ago what that looks like you you hold
[1:20:40] your inner being your spiritual man the
[1:20:43] spiritual part of Who You Are Soul and
[1:20:45] Spirit you hold that before the Lord
[1:20:48] when the word is going forth and you say
[1:20:50] as I just said a moment ago you say to
[1:20:53] the Lord may your word accomplish in me
[1:20:56] right now everything that I have need of
[1:20:59] see we don't draw closer to God or
[1:21:03] deeper in the word
[1:21:05] we do on the outside
[1:21:08] it's only what we do on the inside that
[1:21:11] brings us into closer relationship with
[1:21:13] him are you with me today we have some
[1:21:16] ground to cover so I need your help in
[1:21:18] the message Hebrews chapter 4 paragraph
[1:21:23] 92. brother banham says this
[1:21:33] now watch he's talking about the law
[1:21:39] wasn't mixed with faith they didn't keep
[1:21:43] it
[1:21:44] they kept the Sabbath in a memorial that
[1:21:48] they were going to a land of Sabbath to
[1:21:52] have everlasting rest from all their
[1:21:55] troubles and all their worries no more
[1:21:58] task Masters no more restless nights
[1:22:02] they were on their way to the promised
[1:22:05] land of rest it flowed with milk and
[1:22:09] honey The Grapes was so big that two men
[1:22:12] Pat one Bunch over their shoulders oh
[1:22:16] what a land of blessed rest but they
[1:22:20] failed to get it when they got there
[1:22:23] because of their unbelief can you
[1:22:26] imagine coming all the way to the
[1:22:29] entrance of the promised land and not
[1:22:32] finding the faith to cross over
[1:22:36] you can look across the river and see
[1:22:40] everything you've been moving towards
[1:22:43] all of your 40 Years of journeying is
[1:22:47] behind you and you can now see and
[1:22:50] perhaps a fragrance floats across the
[1:22:53] water to where you're standing and you
[1:22:56] not only see the rest you not only can
[1:22:59] hear the sounds of the beautiful birds
[1:23:02] and beautiful expressions of God's
[1:23:04] creation but maybe you're close enough
[1:23:06] that you can smell the grapes I need you
[1:23:09] with me this morning you can smell the
[1:23:12] grapes it it's so close that you can
[1:23:15] feel it you can smell it you can see it
[1:23:18] and then realize there's something
[1:23:20] standing between you and Crossing that
[1:23:23] River and inheriting everything that God
[1:23:25] has prepared for you there's only one
[1:23:27] thing that will ever keep you out
[1:23:31] there's only one sin
[1:23:33] and that's unbelief
[1:23:35] and we may feel like as believers
[1:23:40] that we can't have any of that in US
[1:23:43] well I want you to know that's just not
[1:23:46] the way it is
[1:23:47] because we're living in a body of Flesh
[1:23:50] and we're living with a soul that likes
[1:23:53] to reason
[1:23:54] come on we'll get there in a minute and
[1:23:57] and so unbelief is something that that a
[1:24:00] real believer may have to deal with on a
[1:24:02] fairly regular basis
[1:24:04] but what we need to do is be so
[1:24:06] spiritually Discerning that when that
[1:24:09] doubt begins to creep in and that
[1:24:11] unbelief against a scream in our head we
[1:24:14] need to be so Discerning that we take
[1:24:16] the sword
[1:24:18] and we start dealing with that unbelief
[1:24:20] and dealing with a lie and dealing with
[1:24:23] that in the contrary or negative thought
[1:24:25] and we don't do it when we get a chance
[1:24:29] but we take a chance immediately to deal
[1:24:33] with it I'm telling you if you don't
[1:24:35] deal with it immediately you'll go on to
[1:24:37] something else on your phone
[1:24:40] you'll keep scrolling we can't treat our
[1:24:42] spiritual life like we treat our natural
[1:24:44] life and just scroll up or scroll down
[1:24:47] we must stop
[1:24:49] and deal with unbelief and we must do it
[1:24:52] immediately and sometimes we might need
[1:24:55] to call one another into accountability
[1:24:58] you're speaking death
[1:25:01] you need to Speak Life because death
[1:25:04] produces what death what does life Words
[1:25:08] of Life produce life they fail to get in
[1:25:12] when they got there because of what
[1:25:15] they're unbelief they were turned aside
[1:25:18] at one at only 40 miles from where they
[1:25:22] left Egypt
[1:25:24] do you realize how easy it would have
[1:25:26] been
[1:25:28] how short of a journey it would have
[1:25:29] been I don't mean easy as though there
[1:25:32] had been no struggle it's a desert it's
[1:25:34] still 40 miles
[1:25:37] not like it is today you just jump in
[1:25:39] the car and go it wouldn't take you a
[1:25:40] little while or an airplane wouldn't
[1:25:42] take you they're still walking and
[1:25:43] there's a lot of them to get there but
[1:25:46] it shouldn't have took 40 years to go 40
[1:25:48] miles can anybody say Amen to that
[1:25:51] but here they were from where they left
[1:25:53] in Egypt to the promised land and they
[1:25:55] were 40 years getting there
[1:25:58] why
[1:26:00] because of their unbelief
[1:26:02] so all that God was trying to do for
[1:26:05] them and in them and through them was
[1:26:09] not accomplishing what it needed to
[1:26:10] accomplish why because they weren't
[1:26:13] doing their part
[1:26:15] they weren't submitting them they said
[1:26:17] we believe the law we believe the
[1:26:19] instruction and we're obeying to the
[1:26:21] best of our ability to do what we're
[1:26:23] told to do we're keeping the rules so to
[1:26:25] speak
[1:26:26] but I want to tell you something
[1:26:28] salvation true Born Again experience is
[1:26:32] not accomplished by keeping the rules
[1:26:35] it's an Act of Faith
[1:26:38] it's a spiritual exchange it's purchased
[1:26:41] with spiritual currency and not with
[1:26:44] natural sweat
[1:26:45] it's it's labor but it's not toil
[1:26:49] and there's a difference and we'll see
[1:26:50] that in the scripture in just a while
[1:26:52] they're 40 years getting there why
[1:26:54] because of their unbelief let's go on
[1:26:58] God gave them their prophet
[1:27:01] gave him his sign gave him the pillar of
[1:27:05] fire showed signs and wonders preached
[1:27:08] the gospel to them and they walked out
[1:27:11] after the fishes and Loaves and fell in
[1:27:14] the wilderness and their carcasses
[1:27:17] perished in the wilderness see they ate
[1:27:21] the manna
[1:27:23] they ate the quail
[1:27:25] hello
[1:27:27] they drank the water
[1:27:29] they saw God purify the bitter water
[1:27:33] and still they weren't doing their part
[1:27:36] God was doing his part how many of you
[1:27:39] believe God is faithful he never misses
[1:27:42] or fails to do his part but you and I
[1:27:45] have a part in this we must put
[1:27:48] something in we must give something of
[1:27:52] ourselves spiritually to the truth that
[1:27:54] we hear so let's go on
[1:27:57] Jesus at the fountain he said our
[1:28:01] fathers eat Manna in the wilderness for
[1:28:04] 40 years
[1:28:05] said I am that bread of life that come
[1:28:10] from God out of Heaven I am the bread of
[1:28:14] life Moses didn't give you that bread my
[1:28:19] father gave that bread and I am the
[1:28:22] bread that comes from God out of Heaven
[1:28:24] if a man eats this will never die that's
[1:28:29] the difference
[1:28:31] now what does that sound like to you
[1:28:33] what what does that bring up in your
[1:28:34] mind if eating the living bread which is
[1:28:37] Jesus Christ if it gives us eternal life
[1:28:40] does that remind you of the tree of life
[1:28:43] it's a representation of the very same
[1:28:45] person the Lord Jesus Christ now brother
[1:28:48] Branham describes the the tree of the
[1:28:51] knowledge of Good and Evil in several
[1:28:53] different ways in fact if you follow the
[1:28:55] message he identifies it as several
[1:28:57] different things but he's always clear
[1:29:00] about who the tree of life is
[1:29:05] sometimes he calls the tree of the
[1:29:07] knowledge of Good and Evil the woman
[1:29:10] sometimes he calls us to calls the tree
[1:29:12] of the knowledge of Good and Evil Satan
[1:29:16] but he's always clear
[1:29:19] on who the tree of life is it's the same
[1:29:22] one who stood among them and said I am
[1:29:24] the bread of life
[1:29:26] you you taste of me and you're never
[1:29:28] going to get hungry again and what he
[1:29:30] was saying by that is you'll only want
[1:29:32] to eat who I am you'll only want to
[1:29:34] partake of who I am like he said to the
[1:29:37] woman at the well it's not that you
[1:29:39] won't ever be thirsty again but there's
[1:29:41] no other water that will ever satisfy
[1:29:43] you again once you've tasted the water
[1:29:45] that I am not just the water that I give
[1:29:48] but the water that I am are you with me
[1:29:51] he said they'll never die there's the
[1:29:53] difference okay let's go on
[1:29:56] now watch they they said that they they
[1:30:00] drank from the rock that was in the
[1:30:02] wilderness for the space of so many
[1:30:04] years he said I am that rock Blessed Be
[1:30:08] His holy name I am that rock how could
[1:30:12] he be that Rock that Rock was a
[1:30:15] spiritual rock it followed the children
[1:30:19] of Israel that rock was a spiritual rock
[1:30:24] it represented Jesus Christ himself even
[1:30:29] our Lord was with them in the wilderness
[1:30:32] journey and provided water for them it
[1:30:35] followed the children of Israel and
[1:30:37] Moses had a stick in his hand which was
[1:30:40] what
[1:30:41] a judgment Rod of God and God told him
[1:30:46] to Smite The Rock and he smote The Rock
[1:30:50] and when he did Waters came from the
[1:30:54] Rock and Christ helped me was that rock
[1:31:00] and the Judgment of God's penalty of sin
[1:31:03] was struck upon Him hallelujah thank God
[1:31:07] can you imagine that almost every page
[1:31:10] of the Wilderness Journey as you're
[1:31:12] reading about the wanderings of the
[1:31:14] children of Israel through the
[1:31:15] Wilderness it's Jesus screaming on
[1:31:18] almost every page
[1:31:19] he was The Rock
[1:31:21] Hallelujah he was the pillar of fire he
[1:31:25] was the cloud by day it just goes on and
[1:31:28] on and on he was the tabernacle he was
[1:31:31] the showbread
[1:31:33] he was the holy of holies he was the way
[1:31:36] in
[1:31:38] it just goes on and on and on it's all
[1:31:40] screaming about the one
[1:31:42] amen not not three one one God hear o
[1:31:45] Israel the Lord thy God is what he's one
[1:31:49] and Christ was that rock and the
[1:31:51] judgments of God's penalty of sin was
[1:31:54] struck upon him God caused to lay on him
[1:31:59] the iniquity of us all and that iniquity
[1:32:03] bursted forth his heart and from his
[1:32:06] heart poured Holy Spirit
[1:32:10] powerful what happened when they struck
[1:32:13] the rock water poured out
[1:32:16] what happened at Calvary water poured
[1:32:19] out
[1:32:19] fulfilling the very typology of the
[1:32:22] scripture that iniquity bursted his
[1:32:24] forth his heart and from his heart
[1:32:26] poured out Holy Spirit like rivers of
[1:32:29] water to a perishing dying people Ashley
[1:32:32] was singing about being one of those
[1:32:34] how many other perishing dying people
[1:32:37] were in here how many of you ever
[1:32:39] remember spiritually you were perishing
[1:32:41] and dying and water came out to meet
[1:32:44] your needs
[1:32:45] water out of the very Heart of Jesus
[1:32:48] Christ water out of the very Heart Of
[1:32:50] God provided for us I am that rock that
[1:32:57] was in the wilderness
[1:32:59] thank God for that I am that rock that
[1:33:03] was in the wilderness let's grab another
[1:33:05] one in the message communion paragraph
[1:33:07] 119.
[1:33:10] he appeared to Eve as an angel of Light
[1:33:15] he told her sure the Lord said this
[1:33:21] the Lord said this but he disagreed with
[1:33:25] God right at the end
[1:33:29] and that's the way false communion does
[1:33:33] today that's pretty serious you can go
[1:33:37] back and hear that in context it's a
[1:33:40] great message to hear he's referring
[1:33:43] several times in this message about true
[1:33:46] communion and false communion now we're
[1:33:49] not talking about Bread and Wine
[1:33:52] remember communion is more than
[1:33:54] unleavened bread and wine communion is
[1:33:57] spiritual communion is a spiritual
[1:34:00] exchange that's what faith is
[1:34:04] faith is not just an abstract faith is
[1:34:08] the evidence of things hopeful it's a
[1:34:10] substance and evidence of things hoped
[1:34:13] for so when we when we talk about this
[1:34:16] communion we're not talking about the
[1:34:18] the wine and the bread we're talking
[1:34:20] about a spiritual relationship and and
[1:34:23] no one is going to enjoy such a
[1:34:25] relationship as that like the Bride of
[1:34:28] Jesus Christ
[1:34:29] this is what God was after from before
[1:34:31] the foundation of the world to have a
[1:34:33] people that he could have spiritual
[1:34:35] communion with
[1:34:37] spiritual fellowship with how is that
[1:34:40] possible it's Spirit to Spirit
[1:34:42] Fellowship it's your spirit that's been
[1:34:45] regenerated by the Holy Spirit having
[1:34:48] fellowship with him who is the eternal
[1:34:51] spirit I'm telling you there's nothing
[1:34:53] like it I experienced some of it this
[1:34:56] morning
[1:34:58] when I was in the presence of the Lord I
[1:35:00] was experiencing some of that spiritual
[1:35:03] exchange and you are too if you're if
[1:35:06] you're going about your praise in the
[1:35:08] right way if you're praising in the
[1:35:11] right way it will lead you to a place of
[1:35:13] worship which becomes communion
[1:35:15] praise is not communion praise is the
[1:35:18] way to get to communion and it's wrong
[1:35:21] to judge praise
[1:35:25] really it's wrong to judge somebody's
[1:35:27] praise some people knock like this
[1:35:35] some people knock a little louder
[1:35:39] some of us when we want to get
[1:35:40] somebody's attention
[1:35:41] [Music]
[1:35:45] now I may tell you that your little old
[1:35:47] puny knock is not going to get me to the
[1:35:49] door because I can't hear it but I may
[1:35:52] not be able to change the way you knock
[1:35:53] I'm not gonna but when I'm coming into
[1:35:56] that presence and I know I got to get
[1:35:59] through some stuff to get there I'm not
[1:36:01] coming to the door like that
[1:36:05] we're talking Ashley again we're talking
[1:36:07] what she was singing about again what
[1:36:10] were the two what were the in verse one
[1:36:12] what were the two words you said people
[1:36:14] people call it
[1:36:16] disgraceful
[1:36:18] and distasteful
[1:36:20] Monarch is distasteful
[1:36:25] that makes me want to knock harder
[1:36:28] none of your business how I knock
[1:36:32] good somebody else's pray I tell you
[1:36:34] what if I could get in with that I would
[1:36:36] yes sir
[1:36:39] I'd be just like my granny she saw
[1:36:42] remember she looked down there in the
[1:36:44] altar bench and she saw sister Havens
[1:36:45] Carter get the Holy Ghost
[1:36:48] she said she looked like an angel
[1:36:51] it looked like a light was on her face
[1:36:53] and her lips were just barely moving and
[1:36:56] stammering lips and a little language
[1:36:57] was coming out just a quiet little
[1:37:00] little language was coming out of her
[1:37:02] lips and her she said there wasn't a
[1:37:04] wrinkle in her dress
[1:37:07] she said she looked just like a saint
[1:37:10] and she said oh Lord I want the Holy
[1:37:13] Ghost like that
[1:37:16] you don't get to choose how you receive
[1:37:19] him
[1:37:21] she said I got him all right but I
[1:37:23] didn't get him like Havens Carter
[1:37:25] she said I ran and I jumped and I
[1:37:28] laughed and I cried and I rolled and I
[1:37:31] beat the Wall
[1:37:33] now who is to say that either of those
[1:37:37] experiences is not the right one
[1:37:40] I know what the prophet said he said a
[1:37:43] real birth is a mess and he said it
[1:37:46] didn't matter whether it takes place in
[1:37:47] a grubby old stable or in the fine uh
[1:37:50] Peak hospital room a birth is a messy
[1:37:53] exchange Hallelujah no one should judge
[1:37:57] the way you approach him now I do
[1:38:00] believe that things should be done
[1:38:02] decently and in order I don't think we
[1:38:06] ought to be coming in here to try to
[1:38:07] draw attention to ourselves
[1:38:10] but you can usually tell if somebody's
[1:38:13] got a little a way of watching to see
[1:38:15] who's watching them don't do that
[1:38:19] it got quiet
[1:38:21] don't do what you're going to do to
[1:38:23] praise the Lord and then look to see if
[1:38:24] anybody's watching you
[1:38:26] just assume they are
[1:38:30] Hallelujah and turn it up
[1:38:34] don't be intimidated by somebody's
[1:38:36] wandering eye and don't put on a shelf
[1:38:39] for them
[1:38:41] but get ready to get to him
[1:38:44] because communion doesn't take place in
[1:38:47] the praise
[1:38:48] communion excuse me I'm sorry what's
[1:38:51] going on with my voice communion takes
[1:38:53] place in the in the realm of Glory
[1:38:57] and Glory the atmosphere of Heaven comes
[1:39:01] to respond to our praise did you hear me
[1:39:06] the atmosphere of Heaven comes on us to
[1:39:09] respond to our praise and when we get in
[1:39:13] glory when we realize we have broken in
[1:39:16] to the atmosphere of heaven and Glory
[1:39:20] has begun to come into the room
[1:39:23] that's when you don't want to hoop
[1:39:24] anymore
[1:39:26] that's when you don't want to holler
[1:39:28] anymore that's when you don't want to
[1:39:30] jump pews anymore that's when you just
[1:39:32] want to stand in his glory and have
[1:39:34] communion
[1:39:38] you want to have communion with him
[1:39:42] his Spirit
[1:39:44] communing with your spirit that looks
[1:39:47] exactly like his
[1:39:53] the reason why they're so
[1:39:55] much confusion on spirit
[1:39:58] and soul
[1:40:02] part of that is because of our
[1:40:04] understanding
[1:40:06] of what a spirit is
[1:40:08] we think of a spirit as being a
[1:40:11] motivating Fallen entity
[1:40:13] and we say there's a spirit of jealousy
[1:40:16] on her or I'm dealing with a spirit of
[1:40:19] resentment or a spirit of bitterness and
[1:40:22] when we think in those terms then we
[1:40:25] don't see clearly what Holy Spirit
[1:40:27] really is
[1:40:29] and sometimes I grew up hearing this
[1:40:32] expression he has such a mean spirit
[1:40:36] now when brother banham is pray
[1:40:38] preaching in the beginning he had the
[1:40:41] order like the Bible gives us the order
[1:40:43] body
[1:40:45] Soul and Spirit years later in his life
[1:40:49] he would do both
[1:40:53] there'd be a sermon he'd say one order
[1:40:55] and another sermon he said another order
[1:40:57] and then in the end of his ministry he
[1:40:59] would always say body
[1:41:03] Soul excuse me Body Spirit and soul as
[1:41:07] the inside of the inside
[1:41:10] if you will do a search you'll find
[1:41:13] brother Branham talking about things
[1:41:15] like a cantankerous spirit
[1:41:18] I grew up hearing people say he has such
[1:41:20] a mean Spirit about him
[1:41:23] I hear people say oh she has such a
[1:41:26] sweet spirit
[1:41:28] and when you have that kind of an idea
[1:41:31] of what a spirit is you can easily get
[1:41:34] confused about what's happened in your
[1:41:36] spirit
[1:41:39] when when we say that we are Body Soul
[1:41:42] and Spirit we're not talking about our
[1:41:45] personality
[1:41:47] when brother Branham says that the that
[1:41:49] the uh spirit is the nature of the Soul
[1:41:53] he's talking about the way it behaves is
[1:41:56] that right the nature of something and
[1:41:59] so if someone has a problem in their
[1:42:01] soul their their demeanor their spirit
[1:42:05] is contaminated by what's going on in
[1:42:08] their soul so I totally understand what
[1:42:11] he's preaching to us but that's not what
[1:42:13] I'm talking about I'm talking about how
[1:42:15] you're made you are made Body Soul in
[1:42:19] the middle and spirit on the inside of
[1:42:21] the inside and you're born with a fallen
[1:42:24] spirit
[1:42:25] when you get here it's already corrupt
[1:42:28] the Bible said we came into this world
[1:42:32] we're shaping an iniquity and we come
[1:42:35] into this world doing what
[1:42:37] speaking lie do you have to teach a
[1:42:39] child to be prejudiced you do yes you do
[1:42:43] yes you do
[1:42:45] you have to teach a child to be
[1:42:46] prejudiced
[1:42:49] but you don't have to teach a child to
[1:42:52] lie that's where I caught you you
[1:42:53] thought I was going to say lie
[1:42:55] you don't have to teach a child to be to
[1:42:58] to lie now I'm going to get confused
[1:43:01] they come into the Earth with that
[1:43:03] ability
[1:43:04] it's just a nature that they have why
[1:43:06] because their spirit's Fallen
[1:43:08] you take a little innocent child
[1:43:09] precious and beautiful and wonderful and
[1:43:11] your grandbaby and perfect in every way
[1:43:16] and you walk into the room and say did
[1:43:18] you get a cookie
[1:43:20] I mean we've got Houdini's around here
[1:43:25] I wonder sometime about my children
[1:43:27] maybe they just weren't as intelligent
[1:43:29] as children are today
[1:43:32] because they didn't act like children
[1:43:33] act today
[1:43:35] they never drew a chair out and climbed
[1:43:38] up on top of the cabinet and went over
[1:43:40] the refrigerator and took treats out
[1:43:43] never
[1:43:45] and that's because they weren't allowed
[1:43:47] to go in a cabinet without permission
[1:43:50] that was our rule
[1:43:52] if you're going to take something out of
[1:43:54] a cabinet you have to get permission to
[1:43:55] do that but we've got them in here right
[1:43:58] here this morning
[1:44:00] that are Houdini's
[1:44:02] that they're there they can do all kinds
[1:44:04] of things they can crawl up on the
[1:44:06] counter and and open it up and eat a
[1:44:09] whole box of goodies
[1:44:11] and then you walk in the room
[1:44:13] crumbs on their chin
[1:44:16] crumbs on their t-shirt or their belly
[1:44:20] a cookie with a big bite out of it in
[1:44:23] the hand
[1:44:24] and you say you were not in the cookies
[1:44:26] were you no
[1:44:32] the evidence is all over them
[1:44:35] but they come into this world with a
[1:44:37] fallen spirit
[1:44:39] and that affects the soul
[1:44:42] that affects the mind and the will and
[1:44:44] the emotion and so it's easy then for
[1:44:47] them to say yes
[1:44:50] I'm not guilty
[1:44:53] I didn't do it
[1:44:55] now what they say I hear most uh he did
[1:44:58] it
[1:44:59] who taught them to blame somebody else
[1:45:02] she did it it's a fallen spirit
[1:45:06] do you understand
[1:45:08] and all you got to do is fix the spirit
[1:45:14] that nature has to to change
[1:45:17] brother Branham said we've got to have a
[1:45:19] nature change
[1:45:20] and the only place in our nature can be
[1:45:23] changed is at the foot of the cross it's
[1:45:26] by the blood of the Lamb it's only by
[1:45:28] Jesus Christ that we get a nature change
[1:45:30] how many of you understand all things
[1:45:33] have passed away behold All Things
[1:45:35] become new I am a new creation in Christ
[1:45:38] ah the things I once loved I hate and
[1:45:41] the things I once hated I now love
[1:45:43] what's happened something has happened
[1:45:45] in your spirit
[1:45:48] your human Spirit not your demeanor
[1:45:52] we're not talking about someone who has
[1:45:54] a mean Spirit or a sweet Spirit or a
[1:45:56] kind Spirit that's what we're talking
[1:45:57] about it's a misuse of the word
[1:46:00] what we're talking about is someone
[1:46:01] who's born with a fallen Spirit which
[1:46:03] every person in this room was born with
[1:46:06] a fallen spirit because of what Adam and
[1:46:08] Eve did in the garden
[1:46:10] and once you get Jesus in that Spirit
[1:46:12] once eternal life gets in that Spirit it
[1:46:15] changes who you are you are no longer
[1:46:17] the same man you are no longer the same
[1:46:19] woman that's what salvation does that's
[1:46:21] what the born-again experience does and
[1:46:24] here's what's so powerful if you get the
[1:46:26] inside of the inside changed and how
[1:46:29] does that take what actually takes place
[1:46:31] Pastor what actually takes place you
[1:46:33] take it's it's a deposit
[1:46:36] just like just like Adam received a
[1:46:38] deposit of the Divine
[1:46:40] here he lay created Out of the Dust
[1:46:44] out of the dirt out of the clay of the
[1:46:47] ground and he looks just like a man
[1:46:50] would look he is formed in the image of
[1:46:53] God but he's lifeless
[1:46:55] he has no life
[1:46:58] now when we talk about life that's when
[1:47:00] we're talking about spirit
[1:47:03] the Bible tells us that God breathed
[1:47:06] what
[1:47:08] can you help me here he breathed the
[1:47:11] breath of life into Adam
[1:47:16] brother Brandon one time said that's
[1:47:18] like the adding of the Dynamics again to
[1:47:20] the mechanics
[1:47:22] a perfectly formed body but no life
[1:47:25] until God came down with with with a
[1:47:28] mouth to mouth
[1:47:29] and blew into Adam the very Breath of
[1:47:33] Life which is not natural it's spiritual
[1:47:37] so spiritual life was breathed into Adam
[1:47:41] and what did it do
[1:47:44] it it came
[1:47:48] he was once a body
[1:47:50] now God's life breath is breathed into
[1:47:53] him and his his whole demeanor his his
[1:47:55] hope his whole being is changed
[1:48:00] and he is not now just a body of clay
[1:48:03] he's now Body Soul and Spirit because
[1:48:07] the Bible said he became a what
[1:48:10] a living soul
[1:48:12] from that moment on Adam now has a body
[1:48:16] to live in he has a soul that connects
[1:48:20] his Spirit to his body
[1:48:26] that's what the soul is it's it's it's
[1:48:28] it's a gift of God to to connect your
[1:48:31] spirit man to your physical body
[1:48:34] and in that Soul Man became a living
[1:48:37] soul in that Soul his mind his mind not
[1:48:41] his brain his mind his will
[1:48:46] did you know Adam didn't have a will
[1:48:51] until God breathed life into him
[1:48:55] when God breathed life into him he was
[1:48:58] capable of having a mind
[1:49:00] a thought process he was capable of
[1:49:03] having a will to choose or to reject and
[1:49:07] he was capable of what else
[1:49:09] mine will
[1:49:11] he was now capable of having emotion
[1:49:15] had had God not breathed Spirit into him
[1:49:18] life
[1:49:19] he would have ever laid there
[1:49:22] as a body of clay
[1:49:26] now when that spirit
[1:49:29] your Fallen Spirit meets living life
[1:49:33] Spirit the Breath of God
[1:49:36] and that's breathed into you in the New
[1:49:38] Birth it starts changing you
[1:49:41] not from the outside in that's religion
[1:49:45] religion believes that you can change
[1:49:47] what's on the inside by keeping the
[1:49:49] rules
[1:49:52] unfortunately the religious Jewish world
[1:49:54] today still believes
[1:49:56] that they can change the inside by
[1:49:59] keeping the rules on the outside but
[1:50:02] that's not God order
[1:50:03] the order is not changed from body to
[1:50:06] Soul to Spirit the change is Spirit soul
[1:50:09] to body when that when your Fallen human
[1:50:13] Spirit receives the life of God
[1:50:17] the Breath of God your human Fallen
[1:50:21] spirit is regenerated
[1:50:26] it's recreated
[1:50:28] it's remade it is not what it was now we
[1:50:33] don't believe two souls or two spirits
[1:50:37] it's it's not a replacement it's a
[1:50:40] regeneration
[1:50:42] he takes up Fallen spirit that always
[1:50:45] lies
[1:50:48] it always leads you to make the wrong
[1:50:50] decision
[1:50:51] Adam one born with a fallen spirit Adam
[1:50:54] was born with a perfect spirit
[1:50:56] I'm stating this over and over and
[1:50:59] slowly because I want every person to be
[1:51:01] able to understand why we use the order
[1:51:03] that we use
[1:51:05] it's the only one that fits the
[1:51:07] scripture
[1:51:08] and I am not of the impression that we
[1:51:11] that we adjust the scripture
[1:51:14] to follow a quote
[1:51:19] you don't have to have an opinion
[1:51:22] but I am of the strong conviction
[1:51:25] that if there is a conflict in an
[1:51:28] expression in a quote and what the
[1:51:30] scripture said we take the scripture
[1:51:33] we don't have to spend our life
[1:51:34] criticizing
[1:51:36] hello
[1:51:37] but you can't preach eternal hell one
[1:51:40] time and a few years later preach no
[1:51:42] eternal hell and be thus saith the Lord
[1:51:44] both times is anybody going to dare to
[1:51:47] say Amen
[1:51:50] it can't be perfect both times
[1:51:54] you can't preach at the white horse
[1:51:56] rider is Jesus Christ
[1:51:58] and then preaches Antichrist and it'd be
[1:52:01] perfect both times
[1:52:03] so somebody said how do we know the
[1:52:05] difference we go to the absolute
[1:52:11] we go to what the word said
[1:52:14] hallelujah how many of you know Jesus is
[1:52:17] not riding with a bow and no errors
[1:52:21] we we understand it by the message and
[1:52:24] by the word but the word of God listen
[1:52:27] the prophet's quote book
[1:52:29] will work
[1:52:35] he's wasn't constantly saying like I
[1:52:37] said the other day like I said the other
[1:52:39] day like I said in the message one's on
[1:52:40] paragraph 11.
[1:52:42] it's quiet
[1:52:44] he said it's written
[1:52:46] it's written it's written so everything
[1:52:49] your pastor says it has to line up with
[1:52:52] the word of God everything your Prophet
[1:52:54] says has to line up with the word of God
[1:52:56] come on now
[1:52:58] it can't be thus saith the Lord both
[1:52:59] times it can't be perfect both times one
[1:53:03] time a human must have been speaking and
[1:53:05] then thus saith the Lord comes and it
[1:53:07] settles it all hello
[1:53:10] prophets are not infallible I know you
[1:53:12] hear it over and over they're not
[1:53:14] infallible
[1:53:15] somebody said how can you know that
[1:53:17] because they're men
[1:53:20] who have bodies who have souls mine will
[1:53:25] and emotion and they have spirits let me
[1:53:28] tell you something that wasn't thus
[1:53:29] saith the Lord that caused Moses to this
[1:53:32] to disbelieve and miss and and disobey
[1:53:35] God's command
[1:53:39] that was an infallibility or inerrancy
[1:53:42] that was a human being that was a man
[1:53:44] who struggled in his position if God
[1:53:46] would have wanted him to be a perfect
[1:53:48] vessel he would have created him to be a
[1:53:50] perfect vessel but God knew exactly what
[1:53:52] Moses was and chose him because of who
[1:53:54] he was
[1:53:55] hello
[1:53:57] God chooses You Because of Who You Are
[1:54:00] he don't turn his back and not know who
[1:54:02] you are and accidentally Choose You for
[1:54:04] his purpose he chooses you because of
[1:54:07] who you are because there's nothing in
[1:54:09] you that he can't redeem he is a
[1:54:11] redeemer by Nature
[1:54:13] are you with me this morning and so
[1:54:15] here's what happens when you're born
[1:54:17] again his spirit
[1:54:20] is placed on your spirit
[1:54:22] and your spirit is regenerated it is
[1:54:26] given New Life
[1:54:27] and therefore you are not living today
[1:54:29] with the same human spirit that you were
[1:54:32] born with
[1:54:35] because the spirit of Jesus Christ has
[1:54:38] regenerated that Fallen spirit that has
[1:54:42] tendency toward death
[1:54:44] can't die but it has tendency toward
[1:54:46] death it can fall and it was Fallen now
[1:54:50] you get the holy spirit in your life it
[1:54:53] regenerates your Fallen human Spirit it
[1:54:55] now becomes a new spirit in Christ
[1:54:57] because you're a new creature and guess
[1:54:59] what happened it starts working through
[1:55:00] the soul
[1:55:05] and our goal is to have our soul LED
[1:55:10] by our spirit
[1:55:12] instead of our flesh
[1:55:14] how many of you recognize when your
[1:55:15] flesh is leading you
[1:55:20] it's just one Tuesday night
[1:55:26] hello
[1:55:28] I really helped the preacher last Sunday
[1:55:30] but I'm tired today and I've got a
[1:55:32] headache
[1:55:34] I guarantee you that's not your spirit
[1:55:36] telling you that I know that's not the
[1:55:39] spirit of Jesus Christ in you telling
[1:55:40] you that where is that message coming
[1:55:42] from it's coming from the body of Flesh
[1:55:45] come on
[1:55:47] I want you to know the most beautiful
[1:55:48] thing about fully adopted Sons when they
[1:55:51] begin to fully manifest they're going to
[1:55:53] come forth in such Authority because
[1:55:56] they are spirit-led
[1:55:58] instead of body lead flesh-led and
[1:56:01] they're not going to be it's like this
[1:56:03] and I haven't used this example in a
[1:56:04] little while but let me use it here and
[1:56:06] then move on
[1:56:07] we could say for instance that whatever
[1:56:10] you feed the most
[1:56:13] is going to rule in your life
[1:56:16] you believe that brother Branham talks
[1:56:18] about the Indian story of two dogs
[1:56:21] black dog on one shoulder white dog on
[1:56:23] one shoulder and and you know uh they're
[1:56:26] both talking
[1:56:29] one of them is saying do the right thing
[1:56:32] what I'm saying do do what you want to
[1:56:34] do or do the wrong thing and and which
[1:56:36] one are you going to listen to well
[1:56:38] you're going to listen to the to the
[1:56:40] loudest
[1:56:43] and what determines which one's louder
[1:56:45] the one you feed the most
[1:56:48] you understand
[1:56:49] so if you're feeding your soulish man
[1:56:52] will and emotions
[1:56:54] more than you're feeling your spirit man
[1:56:58] the regenerated Fallen human Spirit
[1:57:01] that's now become the spirit of Christ
[1:57:02] Living inside of you
[1:57:04] if you're feeding the Salish man more
[1:57:07] than the spirit man this the soulish man
[1:57:09] well he begins to look like a sumo
[1:57:11] wrestler
[1:57:15] and the Little Spirit man inside of you
[1:57:16] begins to look like a little stick man
[1:57:21] who's going to get the job done the sumo
[1:57:24] wrestler
[1:57:25] if you keep feeding the soul the mind
[1:57:27] the will and the emotion if you keep
[1:57:30] feeding constantly the mind and the will
[1:57:32] and the emotion how do we do that by
[1:57:34] entertainment
[1:57:35] by by negative things by by negative
[1:57:38] movies by negative environments by
[1:57:41] negative talk by listening to dirty
[1:57:43] jokes by telling dirty jokes by reading
[1:57:45] on Facebook things you shouldn't read
[1:57:47] and you know you know you should read
[1:57:50] by participating in in blogs and things
[1:57:54] you shouldn't be on and even podcasted
[1:57:56] you shouldn't be listening to if it's
[1:57:57] contrary to the word you better leave
[1:57:59] that thing alone
[1:58:00] because it'll make the sumo wrestler in
[1:58:03] you lead your life
[1:58:04] and what you really want to do is you
[1:58:06] want it to be the other way around you
[1:58:08] don't you don't want to stick man that's
[1:58:09] your spirit and assume more wrestlers
[1:58:11] your soul you want to turn that thing
[1:58:13] around and you want your soul to be like
[1:58:15] a Stickman
[1:58:17] whoa and whatever the spirit says
[1:58:22] not my spirit it's not mine anymore it's
[1:58:26] his spirit
[1:58:28] I will not leave you comfortless I will
[1:58:31] come to you it was God above us and then
[1:58:34] God with us Emmanuel and now what it is
[1:58:37] what it is
[1:58:39] now what it is
[1:58:42] I'm getting cool in my old age and
[1:58:45] it is
[1:58:47] it's God
[1:58:50] got it that won't make a real
[1:58:53] God in what it is
[1:58:57] it's God in us
[1:59:00] he's no longer just above us
[1:59:03] he's no longer just with us where is he
[1:59:06] living
[1:59:07] in us and I don't want him to shrink
[1:59:11] because I'm feeding my flesh and feeding
[1:59:13] my soul oh I want my spirit man to have
[1:59:17] muscles
[1:59:18] I want to keep yielding my inner being
[1:59:21] every time the word goes forward I want
[1:59:23] to hold my spirit out there and I want
[1:59:26] to say help me sword of the word help me
[1:59:32] cut as you go in and cut as you come out
[1:59:35] but I know I'll be whole
[1:59:38] I know you won't leave me wounded and
[1:59:40] bloody
[1:59:41] I know you won't leave me hurt
[1:59:44] and in trouble
[1:59:46] to die by the wayside I know that you
[1:59:49] both Pierce me and restore me I know
[1:59:53] that you will both tear me and you will
[1:59:56] also mend me isn't that what the word
[1:59:58] does the same word that cuts us heals us
[2:00:02] the same word that tears us apart puts
[2:00:05] us back together better than we ever
[2:00:07] were before somebody ought to help me
[2:00:09] now
[2:00:11] oh thank God for what this word is
[2:00:15] not what it can what it is accomplishing
[2:00:19] in his body Hallelujah
[2:00:22] what it is accomplishing
[2:00:24] I want to thank him for that amen I'll
[2:00:29] move off of that now
[2:00:33] he appeared to Eve as an angel of Light
[2:00:36] told her
[2:00:38] sure the Lord said this
[2:00:40] the Lord said this but he disagreed with
[2:00:42] God right at the end and that's the way
[2:00:44] false communion does today when people
[2:00:46] think they're praying to God and won't
[2:00:48] obey the word
[2:00:55] going on now
[2:01:03] when people think they're praying to God
[2:01:05] and won't obey the word
[2:01:07] what is that
[2:01:09] it's false community
[2:01:13] if he abide in me
[2:01:15] and my word in you
[2:01:17] then ask what you will see
[2:01:21] and it'll be done
[2:01:23] he said now if it just can't go one time
[2:01:26] then off the next
[2:01:29] ye abide in me my words abide in you
[2:01:34] did you know that abiding is a spiritual
[2:01:37] Exchange
[2:01:40] the children of Israel didn't inherit
[2:01:42] the promised land because there was no
[2:01:44] abiding in God
[2:01:46] they feared him
[2:01:48] but they didn't know how to make
[2:01:49] communion with him
[2:01:51] and and we know that they had the
[2:01:52] opportunity to do so because the Bible
[2:01:54] tells us they could have invested their
[2:01:57] faith they could have mixed their faith
[2:02:00] with the law and it would have
[2:02:02] accomplished something in them but
[2:02:04] because they wouldn't carry out the
[2:02:06] spiritual Exchange
[2:02:08] they feared the law
[2:02:11] they kept the law
[2:02:14] but they didn't have fellowship with the
[2:02:16] spirit of the law
[2:02:20] anybody follow that
[2:02:22] they had no Fellowship no communion with
[2:02:26] the god of the law with the god of the
[2:02:28] instruction
[2:02:29] and because they didn't do that they
[2:02:31] failed to enter into the rest are you
[2:02:33] still here they failed to enter into the
[2:02:36] rest it can't just be so abiding in me
[2:02:39] and my words abiding in you is is really
[2:02:42] it's putting the faith in
[2:02:45] it's recognizing the value
[2:02:49] of abiding in the word
[2:02:51] and it's carrying forth the spiritual
[2:02:53] participation that is necessary to stay
[2:02:57] in the word and the word stay in you and
[2:02:59] every bit of that every spiritual
[2:03:01] Exchange
[2:03:03] hinges on faith
[2:03:08] every spiritual exercise that you carry
[2:03:11] out in your life is only effective
[2:03:14] if it's demonstrated by faith it's by
[2:03:18] faith it's by faith it's by faith
[2:03:21] somebody say it's by faith he said now
[2:03:24] that abide means to rest there
[2:03:28] you can't rest in the word
[2:03:32] automatically
[2:03:33] without labor
[2:03:37] you can't stay in the word automatically
[2:03:41] without labor we're not talking about
[2:03:43] toil
[2:03:45] we're talking about Labor
[2:03:48] abide means to rest there to stay right
[2:03:51] there yes it's inoculation
[2:03:55] from sinful diseases
[2:03:58] does that sound good to you
[2:04:00] he said now let me close in saying this
[2:04:02] one word now before we go to the
[2:04:04] communion table
[2:04:07] listen carefully
[2:04:09] the blood
[2:04:10] and the body of the Lord
[2:04:15] Plus
[2:04:20] now we like to say
[2:04:22] it's the blood
[2:04:24] and nothing more
[2:04:31] but it's actually
[2:04:32] the blood
[2:04:34] Plus
[2:04:36] faith
[2:04:38] you can't be saved by the blood
[2:04:41] if you don't put your faith in that
[2:04:47] the truth is truth whether I receive it
[2:04:50] or not
[2:04:51] but the truth does not personally
[2:04:54] operate in Effectiveness in my life
[2:04:56] without my part
[2:04:58] come on now so the blood's the most
[2:05:00] powerful thing I'm telling you there's
[2:05:02] nothing more powerful than the blood but
[2:05:04] I can sit right in here today and not be
[2:05:07] changed by the blood and you sit right
[2:05:09] by me and be totally changed by the
[2:05:11] blood
[2:05:12] because you did what you put your faith
[2:05:14] there
[2:05:15] spiritual Exchange
[2:05:17] so you know to say that we don't have
[2:05:19] any responsibility in this it's false
[2:05:22] Doctrine
[2:05:23] we don't have to look the blood has been
[2:05:25] shed and the price has been paid all we
[2:05:27] have to do is believe it
[2:05:29] isn't that what faith is I believe
[2:05:33] and when we have that little bit of
[2:05:36] creeping negative nagging doubt we say
[2:05:40] Lord I believe help thou my unbelief
[2:05:46] my spirit believes
[2:05:50] my soul is where the turmoil lies may I
[2:05:55] keep feeding the spiritual man until it
[2:05:58] overrides and leads my soul into the
[2:06:03] fullness of adoption
[2:06:06] Hallelujah your soul will never lead
[2:06:09] your body into the fullness of adoption
[2:06:12] but your spirit his spirit in you has
[2:06:15] the power and the authority to lead both
[2:06:18] your soul and your body into full
[2:06:21] adoption and into full Redemption feed
[2:06:23] the spirit man and it won't eat anything
[2:06:26] but the word
[2:06:28] it thrives in his presence but it feast
[2:06:32] on his word
[2:06:34] spirit of God in you thrives
[2:06:37] in that corporate atmosphere or the
[2:06:40] glory is moving
[2:06:42] why because the same thing you begin to
[2:06:45] feel is what dwells in you
[2:06:50] the presence of the Lord is what's
[2:06:52] dwelling in you so when you get that
[2:06:54] presence on the inside and that presence
[2:06:57] you're sitting in the atmosphere of that
[2:06:59] presence on the outside you say feeling
[2:07:01] at home in the presence of Jesus
[2:07:05] oh I'm feeling at home
[2:07:10] because she's not only in you but his
[2:07:13] glory is surrounding you oh
[2:07:15] there's nothing like the glory and the
[2:07:18] presence the heaviness of God the
[2:07:21] weightiness
[2:07:24] the weightiness of his presence around
[2:07:27] us there's absolutely nothing like it
[2:07:30] now listen you've got to watch this one
[2:07:31] carefully
[2:07:33] it's one o'clock
[2:07:34] the blood
[2:07:36] and the body of the Lord I need you to
[2:07:39] read this because if you don't you may
[2:07:42] think that the body and the blood is all
[2:07:45] that's necessary
[2:07:48] and that's true to him that believeth
[2:07:51] but you've got to have your belief in
[2:07:52] there so I'm going to have you to read
[2:07:54] that I'm going to read this part you
[2:07:56] read I'm going to read the blood and the
[2:07:58] body of the Lord you read the next
[2:08:00] phrase
[2:08:03] faith is how we access the body
[2:08:06] faith is how we access the blood let me
[2:08:08] say that again
[2:08:10] faith is how we access the blood
[2:08:15] in the 90s message preachers in many
[2:08:19] places were de-emphasizing the blood
[2:08:25] I heard them
[2:08:28] I heard them because of a of a quote
[2:08:32] because of a few statements in the
[2:08:34] message where the Prophet said it wasn't
[2:08:36] the blood that saved you
[2:08:40] and he can make that statement because
[2:08:42] the Bible says we are saved not by Blood
[2:08:45] it says we are saved by
[2:08:47] by grace
[2:08:49] by grace are you saved it is not a Works
[2:08:53] lest any man should boast but how many
[2:08:56] of you understand that because Grace is
[2:09:00] what saved us
[2:09:01] it does not mean that the blood is not
[2:09:04] what paid the price
[2:09:08] and I've explained that to you many
[2:09:09] times by saying that I still believe
[2:09:12] that the token price of my Redemption
[2:09:15] was the blood of God
[2:09:18] with all my heart I believe that but I
[2:09:21] believe that I could have never got to
[2:09:23] the blood and the blood could have never
[2:09:25] gotten to me had it not been for the
[2:09:28] transportation of Grace
[2:09:30] Grace picked up the blood
[2:09:33] and brought it to my address
[2:09:36] and said this is what is available for
[2:09:38] you and my faith said I believe
[2:09:42] and I'm saved I'm changed the birthing
[2:09:45] process begins does anybody follow that
[2:09:48] so Grace is what brings salvation to us
[2:09:53] the blood is what paid the price for our
[2:09:57] salvation and faith is what opens the
[2:09:59] door and gives you the ability to accept
[2:10:02] the delivery
[2:10:03] it's your faith otherwise you you look
[2:10:06] out the window and someone is knocking
[2:10:08] but but that don't put them on the
[2:10:10] inside
[2:10:12] the delivery man is knocking but you
[2:10:14] can't take the delivery if you don't
[2:10:16] open the door
[2:10:18] so faith is what opens the door and says
[2:10:20] here I want that I want the blood
[2:10:24] thank you Grace for giving it to me
[2:10:27] look folks that's more biblically sound
[2:10:30] than getting up here and singing I'm a
[2:10:32] sinner saved by grace
[2:10:34] because anybody knows you can't be both
[2:10:37] at the same time I was a sinner
[2:10:40] but now I'm saved by grace
[2:10:43] I'm no longer a sinner I am now saved by
[2:10:46] grace in fact the prophet said that
[2:10:48] settles it that finishes it I am no
[2:10:52] longer what I was I am now what he is
[2:10:57] and what did that Grace blood faith
[2:11:03] the blood in the body of the Lord read
[2:11:05] it again
[2:11:07] mixed with faith he said that's the
[2:11:10] blood and the body
[2:11:12] that's the spirit and the word read it
[2:11:17] again
[2:11:24] the blood in the body of the Lord
[2:11:28] the word and the spirit of the Lord Plus
[2:11:33] faith equals
[2:11:37] how many of you believe you understand
[2:11:38] what's being said here is powerful
[2:11:41] power You've Got to Believe
[2:11:44] You Must Believe you have to you have to
[2:11:48] make sure I don't care what kind of
[2:11:49] heavenly sermons you hear I don't care
[2:11:51] what kind of word of God you sit under
[2:11:53] the the children of Israel sat under the
[2:11:56] preaching and teaching of Moses
[2:11:59] I told you last week he was the only one
[2:12:02] that God said I'm going to send one like
[2:12:03] him and he was talking about his own
[2:12:05] self coming in sun form
[2:12:08] Jesus was a prophet like unto Moses you
[2:12:11] couldn't have got any more special
[2:12:15] I know Jeffersonville says that the last
[2:12:18] prophet was the greatest prophet
[2:12:21] but that is not what the Bible tells us
[2:12:23] I'm going to get a little controversial
[2:12:24] again
[2:12:27] the Bible doesn't say the last prophet
[2:12:29] is the greatest prophet the greatest
[2:12:32] Prophet is the one in the middle
[2:12:34] that's the one who came between the Old
[2:12:36] Testament and the New Testament
[2:12:39] that's the one who hang Between Heaven
[2:12:41] and Earth because he was both Prophet
[2:12:43] both priests and King amen so the
[2:12:46] greatest prophet of all time is not the
[2:12:49] messenger to the seventh Church age
[2:12:52] they say it almost every Saturday
[2:12:55] I get the email from him almost every
[2:12:57] Saturday telling us
[2:12:59] that the greatest Prophet was the last
[2:13:01] prophet that is not what the Bible said
[2:13:03] I'm going to stay with the Bible
[2:13:06] I hear what brother Branham said about
[2:13:08] that subject
[2:13:09] any man call himself the greatest of
[2:13:13] anything is the least of anything
[2:13:21] it's like brother random said if he
[2:13:22] would if he'd have went up there if he
[2:13:24] did how was that I'm gonna
[2:13:32] came down
[2:13:37] somebody looking yeah yeah
[2:13:43] if it had been humble when he went up
[2:13:45] there on that stage and been humble when
[2:13:47] he come down he'd been all right
[2:13:49] God knows how to Humble us
[2:13:51] amen and we don't have to say things
[2:13:55] like that we don't have to make make
[2:13:57] brother Branham the goat
[2:14:00] the greatest of all time we don't have
[2:14:02] to make our pastor the goat
[2:14:04] come on now
[2:14:06] that's not necessary to follow Jesus you
[2:14:09] just say Lord thank you for who you are
[2:14:11] thank you for the prophet that you sent
[2:14:12] thank you for my pastor thank you for
[2:14:15] Apostles prophets Pastor teachers and
[2:14:17] evangelists they're all just a glove on
[2:14:19] your hand if you work great in US you're
[2:14:22] the only brother bam said he's the only
[2:14:24] great one Among Us
[2:14:26] he was always pointing to the great one
[2:14:30] Moses however one of the greatest
[2:14:33] one of the greatest
[2:14:36] so special
[2:14:38] that Jesus Christ was the one who was
[2:14:42] promised to come to us like Moses
[2:14:45] and so those children of Israel said
[2:14:47] unto that great Revelation that great
[2:14:50] teaching
[2:14:51] and it profited them
[2:14:54] nothing
[2:14:56] nothing
[2:15:00] they couldn't see past
[2:15:02] The Vessel
[2:15:06] they couldn't
[2:15:08] see their own responsibility
[2:15:12] of receiving the word that was spoken
[2:15:14] with faith and therefore it profited
[2:15:17] them nothing and they were banished and
[2:15:19] not allowed to go into the promised land
[2:15:21] and this generation is warned
[2:15:25] scripturally we are warned like every
[2:15:28] generation before us we're warned
[2:15:30] scripturally that we don't make the same
[2:15:32] mistake that we don't sit under the
[2:15:35] powerful word of God and not be profited
[2:15:38] by it because we refuse to carry out our
[2:15:41] part of the spiritual exchange which is
[2:15:43] to mix every word of God we hear with
[2:15:45] what
[2:15:46] faith is that have i belabored the point
[2:15:49] or do you understand what I'm saying the
[2:15:51] blood and the body of the Lord mixed
[2:15:53] with faith
[2:15:54] he that eats my flesh and drinks my
[2:15:56] blood has eternal life and I will raise
[2:15:59] him up at the last day
[2:16:04] the Bible talks about natural communion
[2:16:08] and those
[2:16:10] who partake of natural communion
[2:16:13] unworthily
[2:16:16] and what happens some are sick among you
[2:16:19] some are dead
[2:16:21] because they took this spiritual feast
[2:16:24] unworthily
[2:16:26] our little church mind stay with me just
[2:16:29] a moment our little church mind hears
[2:16:31] that and we say
[2:16:33] somebody took that communion with sin in
[2:16:36] their life
[2:16:37] somebody took that which
[2:16:40] I guess all of us
[2:16:43] have done it
[2:16:45] because we're not talking about the
[2:16:47] attributes of sin we're talking about
[2:16:48] the root of sin which is what unbelief
[2:16:51] have you ever have you ever been in a
[2:16:53] struggle
[2:16:55] but you took communion you drank the
[2:16:57] wine you ate the bread but you were in a
[2:16:59] struggle
[2:17:00] but you know that scripture is not
[2:17:01] talking about that
[2:17:03] we've absolutely misunderstood the
[2:17:05] concept of taking the Lord's supper or
[2:17:08] taking communion unworthily it's not
[2:17:10] that you struggle with unbelief it's not
[2:17:13] that you're not still trying to bring
[2:17:15] some things into under under the
[2:17:17] authority of the spirit it's not that
[2:17:20] you still have soul life because we all
[2:17:23] have soul life to take the Lord's
[2:17:26] communion unworthily means not placing
[2:17:30] proper value
[2:17:33] on the exchange
[2:17:36] it actually has nothing to do with your
[2:17:38] behavior and everything to do with not
[2:17:42] applying your faith
[2:17:44] you see when we come through that
[2:17:46] communion line and we know that we have
[2:17:48] repented of our sins and we have been
[2:17:51] baptized in the name of Jesus and and we
[2:17:54] have received the baptism of the Holy
[2:17:56] Ghost we're not to come through this
[2:17:58] line concentrating on our failure or our
[2:18:02] lack of faith or any unbelief that has
[2:18:05] crept in or any bad attitude that we
[2:18:07] might have shown all we have to do about
[2:18:09] any of that is say Lord have mercy on my
[2:18:11] heart forgive me do you believe for
[2:18:14] forgiveness is easier
[2:18:16] then what we have thought it is it's not
[2:18:18] begging him it's believing him
[2:18:20] so when you come through the line what
[2:18:23] you're doing is saying Lord I value your
[2:18:26] broken body and the power of your blood
[2:18:29] I hold it in higher esteem then I do my
[2:18:33] ability to be worthy of it
[2:18:36] if we come through the line thinking
[2:18:38] that we could ever in our flesh and in
[2:18:40] our soul be worthy of that price hear me
[2:18:43] there's no compromise in what I'm saying
[2:18:47] you need not think you could ever in
[2:18:50] your flesh be worthy of that blood and
[2:18:52] that bread oh no when we come through
[2:18:55] that line we should be coming through
[2:18:57] that line remembering this is the most
[2:18:59] valuable this represents the most
[2:19:02] valuable thing in all the universe
[2:19:06] I'm about to take a sip of wine that
[2:19:10] represents on the earth the Holy Blood
[2:19:13] of God
[2:19:14] I'm about to eat a little piece of bread
[2:19:17] that represents the broken sinless body
[2:19:20] of the Lord Jesus Christ and valuing it
[2:19:23] I honor it I worship on my way I pray I
[2:19:28] do check my heart and I do ask the Lord
[2:19:30] to forgive me simply because I don't
[2:19:33] want to be somebody who tramples the
[2:19:35] blood I want to be somebody who honors
[2:19:38] the blood and esteems the blood and
[2:19:41] values the blood and the body of the
[2:19:44] Lord
[2:19:44] did you know that it makes me very sick
[2:19:47] when I think about how religion shifts
[2:19:51] the focus off of what he's done and
[2:19:54] places to know what I do
[2:19:57] what a cheat
[2:20:02] what a jip
[2:20:04] that I spend more of my life focusing on
[2:20:07] my failure
[2:20:10] than I do on the worthiness of the price
[2:20:14] oh Hallelujah
[2:20:15] thank you for the blood
[2:20:17] thank you for the broken body
[2:20:21] there is no sin there is no sin there is
[2:20:26] no sin that that blood can't redeem
[2:20:29] [Music]
[2:20:31] I'm not talking about not getting
[2:20:33] Deliverance I'm not talking about not
[2:20:35] looking to be free that's not what I'm
[2:20:37] talking about
[2:20:38] I'm talking about religion that causes
[2:20:40] us to look inward when we're supposed to
[2:20:42] be looking upward
[2:20:45] I'm talking about religion that causes
[2:20:47] us to look in the cell in the wrong
[2:20:48] mirror
[2:20:49] we're still looking in the mirror of the
[2:20:51] law
[2:20:52] you can't see who good how good Jesus is
[2:20:55] by looking in the mirror of the law
[2:20:58] you've got to look in the mirror of his
[2:20:59] word
[2:21:01] which is not just law not just
[2:21:03] instruction it's also Grace
[2:21:06] you can't just see you can't see where
[2:21:09] you need to be by just looking at the
[2:21:10] Old Testament
[2:21:12] you've got to look at both old and new
[2:21:13] and what you're going to find out if
[2:21:15] you're looking at the New Covenant
[2:21:17] you're going to find out it's not you
[2:21:18] looking out in the mirror
[2:21:21] I'm looking in but it's not me looking
[2:21:23] out it's him he's the man in the mirror
[2:21:26] he's the one looking out at me and the
[2:21:28] more I look at him the more like him I
[2:21:30] can become the more I look at how rotten
[2:21:32] I am the more rotten I become
[2:21:35] because I get in that vicious gerbil
[2:21:38] will cycle of I got to do more I got to
[2:21:40] do more got to do more got to do more
[2:21:41] got to do more got to do more
[2:21:44] and the reality is we're not doing more
[2:21:46] we need to do less
[2:21:48] we need to do less religious stuff
[2:21:51] and more communion
[2:21:54] so you tell me that praise is not
[2:21:56] important you tell me the worship
[2:21:58] service isn't an important part of the
[2:22:00] service
[2:22:02] I tell you that the word can have
[2:22:04] preeminence in a Godly worship service
[2:22:09] it's not preaching that must take
[2:22:12] preeminence
[2:22:13] it's the word
[2:22:16] you know the word is bigger than a
[2:22:18] sermon
[2:22:19] preach to me Pastor you know the word is
[2:22:22] bigger than a preaching service
[2:22:25] you know he can show up in the worship
[2:22:27] service
[2:22:29] touch your life and you never be the
[2:22:30] same again why because of the word
[2:22:34] not because of your worship because the
[2:22:37] word is living among us
[2:22:40] he can accomplish look the word can take
[2:22:43] preeminence in your prayer life
[2:22:46] if you'd spend more time praying this
[2:22:54] I wonder if the Lord will ever let me
[2:22:56] find
[2:22:57] in this church of people
[2:23:03] who would spend more time
[2:23:06] praying effectively
[2:23:08] instead of constantly thinking I've got
[2:23:10] to spend more time praying
[2:23:14] I think you should spend more time
[2:23:16] praying
[2:23:18] effectively
[2:23:20] and what I find to this day
[2:23:24] even Among Us
[2:23:25] is this process and I'm going to correct
[2:23:28] it every chance I get
[2:23:30] I don't need you to tell me how to pray
[2:23:32] for your loved ones
[2:23:36] you either trust my prayer or don't
[2:23:38] bother me
[2:23:41] I mean that I don't need you to tell me
[2:23:44] how to pray
[2:23:48] the Holy Spirit
[2:23:50] when we not know not how to pray as we
[2:23:53] ought the holy spirit will pray through
[2:23:56] us with are you do you have a little
[2:23:58] more time
[2:24:00] with groanings with intercessions it
[2:24:03] can't be interpreted
[2:24:05] it can't be understood in the natural
[2:24:08] but the spirit knows the mind of the
[2:24:10] spirit
[2:24:11] I said the spirit knows the mind of the
[2:24:13] spirit
[2:24:14] when I read prayer request sometime and
[2:24:17] I get them from all over the world so
[2:24:18] don't you feel like I'm directing this
[2:24:20] to you I get them from all over the
[2:24:21] world and when and I thought my goodness
[2:24:23] you really want me to read this to the
[2:24:25] Lord
[2:24:26] you really want me to tell God how to do
[2:24:28] this change his wife
[2:24:30] hey

[2:24:34] destroying the marriage

[2:24:41] pray that God will move his boss
[2:24:45] and give him another boss

[2:25:08] prayers that that originate in the mind
[2:25:12] out of your will out of your emotion

[2:25:19] time how to pray effectively I will but
[2:25:22] it won't be enough for some of your

[2:27:29] witchcraft prayer you have no authority

[2:27:35] changed you need to pray that your will
[2:27:37] can be changed
[2:27:40] oh it's getting quiet
[2:27:45] stay out of my life
[2:27:47] if you're going to pray that God will
[2:27:50] change my will

[2:27:55] effective
[2:27:57] you're wasting your breath
[2:27:59] God gave me a will
[2:28:03] he will not override it
[2:28:08] now what he can do and will do not
[2:28:10] because you said it
[2:28:12] but because I prayed it
[2:28:14] Lord I see my will I'm using myself just
[2:28:17] as an example for you to follow my
[2:28:19] thought Lord I see that my will is too
[2:28:21] often in conflict
[2:28:23] with your will
[2:28:28] and I'm asking you to let me hear your
[2:28:30] voice
[2:28:31] I'm asking you to let me recognize when
[2:28:34] my will stands in stark contrast with
[2:28:37] your will and give me Grace to surrender
[2:28:41] my will my opinion my thought my
[2:28:45] perception my Paradigm my thought
[2:28:47] processes
[2:28:49] to your will
[2:28:54] if you want to pray effectively for
[2:28:56] someone else pray O Father
[2:28:58] may they be drawn into deeper
[2:29:01] relationship with you that's not
[2:29:03] witchcraft
[2:29:04] that's that's that's like saying God
[2:29:06] bless you did you know brother Rams
[2:29:09] that's the most powerful thing you could
[2:29:10] say to somebody
[2:29:13] God bless you
[2:29:14] it's a prayer
[2:29:16] it's not just a blessing it's a prayer
[2:29:19] and you you answer amen
[2:29:23] sometimes people get a little haughty if
[2:29:25] you say that and they say he does but
[2:29:26] they say it like that he does
[2:29:32] you ought to say oh he does and yes I
[2:29:36] need his Blessing I need his Blessing
[2:29:39] not just to get to heaven but to get to
[2:29:40] Walmart I need his Blessing I've got to
[2:29:43] have it
[2:29:45] thy will be done
[2:29:49] thy kingdom come can I see it again
[2:29:54] thy kingdom come thy will be done
[2:29:59] as in heaven
[2:30:05] so in
[2:30:09] watch
[2:30:11] Earth
[2:30:16] you're not just playing praying for the
[2:30:18] planet
[2:30:21] your part Earth
[2:30:25] your parters
[2:30:26] remember you're a dual citizen
[2:30:29] you were created of both elements
[2:30:31] there's two environments living inside
[2:30:33] of you you're part Earth and part heaven
[2:30:36] Adam was part Earth and part heaven
[2:30:39] so when you pray let your will be done
[2:30:42] in earth even as it is in heaven
[2:30:44] you're not just praying Lord bless the
[2:30:46] world around me and planet Earth
[2:30:50] and I think I'll go hug a tree to
[2:30:52] celebrate
[2:30:53] no no no you're recognizing that you
[2:30:56] were a part of this Earth
[2:30:58] and you're asking God's will to be done
[2:31:00] in you
[2:31:01] and so when we pray for one another we
[2:31:04] simply pray oh God let your will be done
[2:31:06] in my brother in my sister let the very
[2:31:10] desires of Heaven Break Forth into the
[2:31:13] realm of the earth oh God make your plan
[2:31:15] clear to all of us
[2:31:18] don't exclude yourself when praying for
[2:31:21] someone else
[2:31:22] are you still with me
[2:31:24] you're tired
[2:31:29] let's go back to finish that quote
[2:31:33] there you are
[2:31:36] he that eats my flesh and drinks my
[2:31:38] blood
[2:31:39] I know we we did read it but I won't
[2:31:41] finish it I won't go back and do it one
[2:31:42] more time
[2:31:44] has eternal life and I will raise him up
[2:31:47] at the last day there you are what is it
[2:31:49] the communion of the Lord the word and
[2:31:51] the spirit the life in the blood
[2:31:54] the life is in the blood the word and
[2:31:56] the spirit equals eternal life read the
[2:32:00] last
[2:32:02] now I need a few more minutes if you
[2:32:03] need to go God bless you you can
[2:32:06] certainly slip out when you need to
[2:32:08] Hebrews chapter 3 and chapter 4.
[2:32:14] speak to us
[2:32:16] about the Exodus
[2:32:19] about what we leave behind
[2:32:21] and about what we hope
[2:32:23] to inherit
[2:32:25] Hebrews chapter 3 verse 18 through 14.
[2:32:30] we read it last Sunday let's pick it up
[2:32:32] again
[2:32:33] Harden not your hearts
[2:32:36] as in the provocation in the day of
[2:32:39] Temptation in the wilderness when your
[2:32:42] fathers tempted me proved me and so my
[2:32:46] works
[2:32:47] 40 years
[2:32:49] remember I told you that the complete
[2:32:51] Jewish Bible
[2:32:53] refers to that quarrel
[2:32:57] that that uh
[2:33:00] provocation
[2:33:02] as a bitter Coral
[2:33:05] wherefore I was grieved with that
[2:33:07] generation and said they do always err
[2:33:11] in their heart
[2:33:12] which is their mind remember
[2:33:16] it's their soul
[2:33:18] that's where the grieving that's where
[2:33:21] this doubt that's where this spiritual
[2:33:24] laziness came in
[2:33:27] they sat under the word but didn't do
[2:33:29] their part
[2:33:31] they do always err in their heart and
[2:33:34] they have not known my ways
[2:33:38] so I swear in my wrath they shall not
[2:33:41] enter into my rest take heed brethren
[2:33:45] take heed brethren
[2:33:48] lest there be any of you
[2:33:51] in any of you an evil heart of unbelief
[2:33:56] in departing from the Living God
[2:33:59] remember what evil is
[2:34:01] in Hebrew
[2:34:03] it's raw
[2:34:06] Tove is good raw is evil remember Tove
[2:34:09] means when you begin to bring forth the
[2:34:12] fruit
[2:34:13] of the seed that was planted in you God
[2:34:16] says that's Tove
[2:34:18] when you are not bringing forth fruit
[2:34:22] based on the seed of your destiny God
[2:34:25] calls that evil
[2:34:27] so when when the Apostle is saying here
[2:34:30] lest there be any of you with an evil
[2:34:32] heart of unbelief
[2:34:34] it means with a mind
[2:34:38] that is not bringing forth fruit
[2:34:43] manifesting the seed of Destiny
[2:34:47] that was planted in you
[2:34:49] if you and I are not living out a
[2:34:52] portion of our destiny purpose if God
[2:34:54] has called you to do something and
[2:34:55] you're not yet doing it
[2:34:58] you're yielding your heart
[2:35:01] for unbelief
[2:35:03] if you fill your heart and your mind
[2:35:06] with obedience and faith
[2:35:09] if you say to the Lord I'm not asking
[2:35:12] anything of you free of charge I am now
[2:35:15] I've already taken salvation as a gift
[2:35:18] but now I am willing to give you my life
[2:35:22] I will go where you want me to go I'll
[2:35:25] do what you want me to do I'll say what
[2:35:27] you want me to say when you're telling
[2:35:29] that when you're saying that to the Lord
[2:35:31] on a regular basis use me
[2:35:35] Use Me Lord
[2:35:38] use me
[2:35:40] you're not leaving much room
[2:35:43] for an evil heart of unbelief
[2:35:46] you're filling your mind with surrender
[2:35:50] you're operating in your will
[2:35:53] to surrender
[2:35:55] he said take heed Brethren unless there
[2:35:57] be any of you in any of you an evil
[2:35:59] heart of unbelief in departing from the
[2:36:01] Living God
[2:36:03] but exhort one another
[2:36:07] hello
[2:36:08] I got to hear it again
[2:36:11] daily
[2:36:12] you think two hours on Sunday preaching
[2:36:15] and one hour on Tuesday night
[2:36:18] do you think that's enough the word
[2:36:22] not even close
[2:36:25] we have to Feast on this word and we
[2:36:27] have to use this word to encourage and
[2:36:29] exhort one another every day
[2:36:33] the word is more effective than than
[2:36:35] Saint Augustine or Charles Spurgeon or
[2:36:40] the word all these are wonderful things
[2:36:42] even the quotes of our Prophet wonderful
[2:36:44] we live by them we Feast on them let me
[2:36:47] tell you something nothing has the same
[2:36:49] power
[2:36:53] that word of God active and living in us
[2:36:58] can accomplish so much and we can speak
[2:37:02] out of that out of that what God's doing
[2:37:04] in us we can speak out of that to one
[2:37:06] another
[2:37:07] but exhort one another daily while it is
[2:37:10] called today lest any of you be hardened
[2:37:14] through the deceitfulness
[2:37:17] of sin
[2:37:19] and look at verse 14 for we are made
[2:37:22] partakers of Christ
[2:37:24] if we hold the beginning of our
[2:37:26] confidence steadfast unto the end
[2:37:29] Everything Jesus has for us
[2:37:33] is included
[2:37:35] in
[2:37:36] being made partakers of Christ
[2:37:40] everything we have need of is found in
[2:37:44] him
[2:37:46] one amen one uh-huh
[2:37:48] let me try that again
[2:37:51] everything we have need of is found
[2:37:55] in him
[2:37:57] much better in Christ
[2:38:00] if we hold the beginning of our
[2:38:03] confidence steadfast unto the end
[2:38:07] this is not a time to slack up
[2:38:10] this is not a time to compromise in any
[2:38:13] way
[2:38:15] if we do that it becomes an invitation
[2:38:17] to the enemy to strengthen his attack
[2:38:20] against us we cannot give up one inch of
[2:38:24] ground that has been taken in the spirit
[2:38:26] hear me now
[2:38:28] and the Holy Spirit keeps saying to me
[2:38:32] balance
[2:38:35] is the most critical word
[2:38:38] for this hour
[2:38:40] balance
[2:38:42] say it with me balance
[2:38:44] brother Branham told Brother Greene who
[2:38:48] in turn told the world whatever you do
[2:38:51] brother Perry
[2:38:54] keep your balance
[2:38:57] in the scriptures
[2:39:03] balance is the most critical word for
[2:39:06] the hour
[2:39:08] balance is middle of the road
[2:39:20] it's the highest spot
[2:39:23] in a well-built road
[2:39:28] which we don't have any around here
[2:39:31] but a well-built road is engineered such
[2:39:35] that it's taller higher in the middle
[2:39:37] than it is on the edges it's like this
[2:39:41] why
[2:39:45] because the trash the debris washes to
[2:39:49] the gutter
[2:39:51] or the random tells us that we should
[2:39:54] stay in the middle of the road but as an
[2:39:56] early young preacher in this message
[2:39:59] I discovered that the middle of the road
[2:40:03] is not only a a place higher
[2:40:09] so that the trash can run to the gutter
[2:40:12] but I found out that if someone truly is
[2:40:16] determined to stay in the middle of the
[2:40:17] road and keep your balance in the
[2:40:19] scripture you are very likely to get run
[2:40:22] over
[2:40:26] because human nature tends toward
[2:40:29] fanaticism
[2:40:33] and although we get called Fanatics all
[2:40:37] the time
[2:40:40] I consider myself
[2:40:42] as standing in the middle of the road
[2:40:47] so where does that put some of my
[2:40:49] friends
[2:40:53] it's the ones that are getting run over
[2:40:55] all the time
[2:40:57] because
[2:40:58] folks don't embrace you
[2:41:00] if you stand on the scripture
[2:41:05] they don't want to follow somebody
[2:41:08] who wants to stay true to the word
[2:41:10] who wants to take the message of the
[2:41:13] hour and lay it within the borders and
[2:41:16] boundaries
[2:41:17] of the scripture
[2:41:19] it's the only place it can stand
[2:41:22] this message cannot stand apart
[2:41:25] from the Scripture it must stand in the
[2:41:29] scripture
[2:41:31] its strength
[2:41:32] is because it's founded it's Foundation
[2:41:36] is the word
[2:41:39] and we must keep our balance
[2:41:42] not only in the scripture but in all
[2:41:45] things
[2:41:46] moderation and balance
[2:41:49] is essential in this hour
[2:41:53] the legalism of the past
[2:41:56] is not producing the character of Jesus
[2:41:59] Christ
[2:42:02] we must understand that legalism is not
[2:42:06] going to bring us any closer to full
[2:42:08] adoption but following the word will
[2:42:13] every day every hour
[2:42:15] everything Christ has for us involves
[2:42:19] many things some of which though we are
[2:42:21] believers
[2:42:22] we have never fully experienced and in
[2:42:25] the same manner that many in Israel did
[2:42:28] not enter Canaan the promise the
[2:42:31] fullness due to unbelief many Christians
[2:42:34] will not experience all Christ has for
[2:42:38] us
[2:42:39] because of unbelief
[2:42:42] Hebrews 3 19. so we see that they could
[2:42:46] not enter in
[2:42:48] because of unbelief
[2:42:51] when we look at Hebrews 4 we read it in
[2:42:54] the beginning
[2:42:55] verse 12.
[2:42:58] we are first told to labor to enter into
[2:43:02] rest
[2:43:04] we are then told watch
[2:43:07] for unbelief
[2:43:09] then we come to verse 4.
[2:43:12] and verse 4 says
[2:43:14] for the word of God
[2:43:16] watch
[2:43:17] labor to enter in
[2:43:19] to rest
[2:43:22] beware
[2:43:23] of unbelief
[2:43:26] for the word of God
[2:43:30] do you know what the way into rest is
[2:43:34] the word of God
[2:43:36] do you know the way out of unbelief
[2:43:39] the word of God
[2:43:41] if you were reading that whole chapter
[2:43:43] in context you would almost think that
[2:43:45] verse 4 is out of place
[2:43:47] here we're talking about entering into
[2:43:49] rest and not entering into rest and what
[2:43:52] that looks like and what unbelief can do
[2:43:54] and then all of a sudden for the word of
[2:43:55] God
[2:43:57] for the word of God is quick and
[2:44:00] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[2:44:02] sword how many of you know what the
[2:44:03] remedy is
[2:44:05] the remedy for unbelief is what
[2:44:09] the way in to rest is what
[2:44:12] the reason we must labor to interest and
[2:44:16] remove the threat of unbelief from our
[2:44:18] life
[2:44:18] is because the word of God
[2:44:21] is a weapon
[2:44:24] what kind of weapon you think it is well
[2:44:26] the Bible said it's a crushing hammer
[2:44:28] the Bible said it's a devouring Flame
[2:44:31] but the Apostle here says the word of
[2:44:34] God is a
[2:44:37] what
[2:44:39] too edged
[2:44:42] sword
[2:44:43] sharp on both edges
[2:44:46] Cuts in
[2:44:48] Cuts coming out
[2:44:50] but it gets the job done
[2:44:53] if you believe that same man let's stand
[2:44:59] musicians are coming
[2:45:02] word of God Speak
[2:45:06] would you pour down like rain

[2:55:01] if you're particularly struggling
[2:55:05] with negative thoughts
[2:55:09] and unbelief
[2:55:11] when you'd like for the Lord to
[2:55:13] strengthen you and you're not ashamed
[2:55:16] I mean you'd rather it not be so
[2:55:18] me too but you're not ashamed you're
[2:55:21] willing
[2:55:23] to be strengthened of the Lord
[2:55:26] I wish you'd just slip up your hand
[2:55:29] [Music]
[2:55:30] you see God sees every one of these
[2:55:32] hands
[2:55:34] leave it up if you will father
[2:55:38] these are your children
[2:55:40] and we recognize that we're living in an
[2:55:43] evil day
[2:55:45] we recognize that the enemy is
[2:55:48] pulling out all the stops
[2:55:52] his ultimate desire
[2:55:55] is to discourage distract and dissuade
[2:55:58] us
[2:56:00] from actively mixing our faith
[2:56:04] with what we know your word has said
[2:56:08] but we have our hands lifted up today
[2:56:10] standing in your presence saying Lord
[2:56:13] help me
[2:56:17] I don't believe it's true of any of
[2:56:19] these saints that they don't believe
[2:56:22] I personally believe that they all
[2:56:26] believe
[2:56:28] this is that creeping doubt
[2:56:32] that the enemy likes to it's the only
[2:56:35] thing he has
[2:56:37] it's the only tool he has
[2:56:39] and there's only one way to beat him
[2:56:42] back
[2:56:43] and to ultimately defeat him and that is
[2:56:46] the word that you have given us
[2:56:48] so Lord I pray right now over every
[2:56:51] person
[2:56:52] who raised their hand and said the
[2:56:54] battle has been particularly hot lately
[2:56:57] I pray Lord
[2:57:00] oh
[2:57:02] I pray right now
[2:57:04] that your strength would be upon in the
[2:57:07] name of Jesus
[2:57:09] in the name of Jesus
[2:57:11] in the name of Jesus
[2:57:14] we resist the enemy now
[2:57:17] now we expose him and take authority
[2:57:21] over him
[2:57:22] in the name of Jesus
[2:57:25] we drive our stake a little deeper in
[2:57:28] the ground today
[2:57:30] we refuse to allow the enemy
[2:57:34] to cause us to miss out
[2:57:36] on the rest
[2:57:39] there is a rest given to the people of
[2:57:42] God
[2:57:44] one that you don't have to be buried
[2:57:47] to have
[2:57:48] it's our rest it's our inheritance
[2:57:52] it's our promise
[2:57:55] and I ask right now Lord that your
[2:57:58] strength if you're standing near someone
[2:58:00] with a hand up still
[2:58:02] just lay your hand on a shoulder
[2:58:04] Italian
[2:58:07] Lord we pray for streamers
[2:58:11] who may have lifted their hands
[2:58:13] who may know the same struggle
[2:58:17] and we ask for strength for them right
[2:58:19] now
[2:58:20] in the name of Jesus
[2:58:23] foreign
[2:58:26] [Music]
[2:58:30] I think it's amazing and wonderful that
[2:58:33] your people would be honest and open
[2:58:35] before you and say Lord I I struggle the
[2:58:39] battle has been particularly hot in my
[2:58:43] mind and I want to step out of that
[2:58:45] today
[2:58:47] and if it is not your will for me to
[2:58:50] move completely out of it I want
[2:58:51] something good to be accomplished
[2:58:53] through this battle I'm willing to
[2:58:55] receive whatever blessing you have for
[2:58:57] me Lord if you'll keep strengthening my
[2:58:59] hands to fight
[2:59:01] if you'll keep strengthening my
[2:59:03] shoulders
[2:59:04] to push against and push back whatever
[2:59:08] the enemy sins
[2:59:09] give me Grace and strength to refuse his
[2:59:12] delivery
[2:59:14] to possess the Reigns of my own mind
[2:59:18] casting down all imaginations
[2:59:22] bringing into
[2:59:24] subjection every thought
[2:59:27] that exalts itself
[2:59:29] against the intimacy of relationship
[2:59:32] with Christ
[2:59:34] is
[2:59:37] [Music]
[2:59:40] I don't usually do things like this but

[2:59:44] through your mouth this time
[2:59:47] just a deep breath deep as you can take
[2:59:52] and then let it out
