Description:
“And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.” Zechariah 14:16

Each year, we gather together corporately during the Feast of Tabernacles to celebrate the faithfulness of the Lord and to remember how it was during this season that our Lord Jesus Christ came down and tabernacled in body of flesh to redeem all of mankind. This celebration is rich with prophetic symbolism, of which each year we greatly anticipate and look toward its prophetic fulfillment in our lives.

Join us, this October 8th-15th, 2017 at New Hope Revival Ministries in Smiths Station, Alabama as we gather together during this Feast of the Lord and celebrate all He is doing in His Bride!

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] hi I'm pastor Shelly and I've been thinking about our international camp meeting that's coming up October the 8th through the 15th it's almost upon us and I'm believing the Lord for an outstanding time we'd certainly like for you to come and be with us we have our camp meeting now during the Feast of Tabernacles or at least that's the way the Lord has directed us over the last few years some people say well isn't Tabernacles just from the past and we say no actually Tabernacles is a part of our past it is a part of our present it is a part of our future it was a Feast of the Lord that was ordained in the scripture where the people of God were told to dwell in Sioux cos in temporary structures as they journeyed to remember how God had protected them and how he had brought them through the wilderness so every year it is a time of remembering the faithfulness of God presently it reminds us that God Himself tabernacled in a body of flesh our Lord Jesus Christ that's how much God loved you and I that he came down in spirit form into the body of a our Lord Jesus Christ created just for the purpose of redemption he became the most excellent priest because he became a body of flesh his blood perfect blood creative bloodshed for you and I to be redeemed so we think about that also during the time of Tabernacles but it's also a part of our future Tabernacles Zechariah chapter 14 it tells us beginning in verse 16 and it shall come to pass that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the king the Lord of hosts and to keep the Feast of the Tabernacles and it shall be that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the king the Lord of Hosts even upon them shall be no rain and if the family of Egypt go not up and come not and have no rain there shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite the heathen that come not up to the Feast of Tabernacles this shall be the punishment of Egypt the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles it goes on to say in that day there shall be upon the bells of the horses holiness unto the Lord and even in the pots in the Lord's house shall be like the bowls before the altar this is Tabernacles future this is millennial remembrance of Tabernacles we choose this time of year because it's a time to come together and reflect upon all the goodness the faithfulness of the Lord in the present year it's a time of harvest it's a time to remember what God has supernaturally placed in our hands and it's from that harvest it's from those blessings that we again sow seed for the next year for the next harvest it's such a principle in God's dealings with his children through the scripture that we come together and thank God for early rain so that the latter rains come or we come together and thank God that the first grain has come to maturity and we do that prophetically to look forward in anticipation to the rest of the grain coming to maturity I want you to know that it is a prophetic time to be gathered together wherever you are in the name of the Lord but why don't you come and gather together with us here corporately we're we're going to be worshiping the Lord and celebrating the goodness of God also on October the 13th Friday night and the service we're gonna dedicate our new studio and our new broadcast equipment that God is supernaturally provided for us so that we can again step into another part of the mandate that he is placed upon this small little ministry here in Smith Station Alabama and I'd like for you to be a part of both camp-meeting and also the dedication of our studio and I'd like for you to just come together and celebrate the faithfulness and the goodness of the Lord at the great time of the Feast of Tabernacles I remember in the New Testament scripture when they were carrying out the water libation during this particular time of the year of the biblical year we could even say and the priest is bringing the water from the pool of Siloam and he's pouring it out over the altar as a thanksgiving offering to God thanking God for the way he has provided the rains in the previous season and for the rains that it will be much needed in the coming season and in the middle of this most solemn ceremony our Lord Jesus worshiping his father in the temple cries out if any man thirst let him come to me and drink when I when I reflect upon that event the the of course a lot of tradition had crept in and it must have been sort of a religious and ceremonial moment the people knew enough to be respectful and actually the feast was a very joyous time Sukkot or Tabernacles was a time of great celebration but this particular moment was known to be quite a solemn and and quiet moment until the water was poured and I like to think about that our Lord he he's not much for the traditions of men you know we can take the truths of God God's Word and make them so dry and so starchy that there's really no longer any spirit in them but here came the Spirit of God in a ceremony that had been carried out for so many years of course it was a noble thing that they were doing and they were doing it in obedience to what God was expecting of his people but here the Lord came with the spirit here's Jesus with the spirit who's thirsty who has a need everything you have need of is standing in the midst of you right now if you'll just come and take a drink so I want to say to you that during this time of the Feast of Tabernacles there swiftly upon us let's come and drink if you can't be with us it can't meeting wherever you are set some time aside during that week to drink of that living water of God let the spirit of revelation and understanding be poured out upon your life let him open up the scriptures to you in such a way that it would it would be so similar to what happened on the road to emmaus when their eyes were open they began to recognize who it was that had spoken to him and they said did not our hearts burn within us as he talked with us by the way I believe that those who gather with us at camp meeting are gonna leave every service with that kind of a praise upon their lips didn't our hearts burn tonight as the Lord spoke to us I'm so thankful friend that our God is still a speaking God and that he uses the fivefold ministry he uses the great revelation of Jesus Christ that we have received a generation ago and he uses the gifts of the Spirit he also uses the atmosphere that's produced when we come together in corporate praise and worship and we're not just going to do that at camp meeting time we try to do that every time we gather in the name of the Lord and I trust that you do as well but I don't want you to miss out on this special season of the Lord I want to just say again wherever you are it's time to come before the Lord with with repentance and and with lots of Thanksgiving to say Lord I'd like a reset in my life I want to come back to the simplicity of my relationship with you what I once had with you perhaps in the beginning when when our hearts were were so excited about the change that the Lord had just carried forth in our life well I want you to know he's still changing his people now in this hour from the inside out his word is purifying us it is burning out the dross he's giving us grace to watch our thoughts to pull them down when we recognize that they're contrary to the word of truth that's been spoken over us it's just the grace of God it seems that we're able in this season to come quicker back to joy when when the enemy would bring stress or trial or hardship in our life it seemed that it would take us so long to get through it maybe a day would be ruined maybe weeks you know we can wallow around and in the things that are going on in our life but it seems like there's even a special grace in this hour to come quickly back to peace to come quickly back to joy because this living God who chose to Tabernacle in the body of our Lord Jesus Christ he has now chosen to tabernacle in you and I if you are born again by the Spirit of God filled with the Holy Ghost and fire then this spirit that lives inside of you in fact this life that lives inside of you is his spirit and it is his life and when we recognize that our life is not our own that the life that we now live is absolutely by the life of Jesus Christ it causes us to want to have more fellowship and more intimacy with him I am convinced that intimacy determines proximity and so the more we draw nigh to him I believe the closer we find fellowship with him and I don't know about you but I want to be the John in my generation the one who presses through to lay my head on the Lord's shoulder and tell him how much I love him and how much I need him in this hour so let's celebrate with great joy the Feast of the Lord and the reality and the fulfillment of what God has done Our Lives God bless you bye-bye [Music]
