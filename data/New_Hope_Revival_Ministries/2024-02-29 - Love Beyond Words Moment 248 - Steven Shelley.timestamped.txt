[0:00] listen to me folks please it's so easy
[0:02] to be religious and to say I love the
[0:05] Lord yes and it's just words what does
[0:08] that look like if you really love the
[0:10] Lord what does that look like well I
[0:12] want I want to give you one example he
[0:14] means more to you than your
[0:18] buddies he means more to you than your
[0:23] hobbies he means more to you than your
[0:27] [Music]
[0:28] habits love the Lord is about
[0:32] priorities it's about placing things in
[0:35] the right beset in the right
[0:38] order and our priorities are
[0:42] right it's one of the reasons why
[0:44] fasting can be so effective is because
[0:47] it reminds us that the Lord is more
[0:51] important than the
[0:54] meal knowing that he hears you knowing
[0:57] that he sees you knowing knowing that
[1:00] he's mindful of you knowing that he
[1:03] looks at you and recognizes your love
[1:06] for him becomes more important let me
[1:08] tell you something he's jealous over you
[1:10] I hope you hear me he's jealous over
[1:14] you he loves you so
[1:18] much but what he wants more than
[1:20] anything else is to have fellowship with
[1:23] you and I as individuals and he wants us
[1:26] to come to the place where we become as
[1:29] a
[1:30] addicted to that experience to that
[1:33] moment of fellowship and intimacy with
[1:36] him more
[1:39] addicted it becomes more of a necessity
[1:42] to get along with him it becomes more of
[1:45] a necessity to hear his voice than to
[1:48] even hear your wife's Voice or your
[1:50] husband's Voice or your pastor's voice
[1:53] to long to hear the voice of the
[1:56] bridegroom love is not something that
[1:59] you can just pull out of your heart it's
[2:01] not something like a magic trick you can
[2:03] pull out of a hat God is the author of
[2:07] love the only way to overcome not loving
[2:10] one another is to draw closer to the
[2:13] Lord he is love amen the closer we get
[2:17] to God the more we'll love him the more
[2:20] we'll appreciate his love for us and the
[2:23] more we will learn to love one another
[2:26] the popular and the
[2:28] unpopular the those in our click and not
[2:31] in our
[2:32] click those we get along good with and
[2:35] like to relax with and those we don't
[2:37] like to relax with we've got to love
[2:41] them anyhow and it's not loving them in
[2:43] word that God is interested in when we
[2:46] learn to love one another it's not by
[2:49] word only it's by
[2:51] deed the love that God has toward us is
[2:56] perfected it is matured as we learn to
[3:00] show that love one to another and then
[3:03] that becomes perfect love it becomes
[3:06] matured love it becomes I love you
[3:10] whether you love me or
[3:12] not why don't this little bride make up
[3:15] our mind we're coming down off the
[3:17] gerbal wheel of performance we're not
[3:19] going to try to compare our life with
[3:21] someone else our family with someone
[3:24] else's family we're going to try to fall
[3:26] so in love with our brid groom
[3:30] that he matters more than
[3:33] possessions he matters more than fancy
[3:38] trips he's
[3:43] everything
