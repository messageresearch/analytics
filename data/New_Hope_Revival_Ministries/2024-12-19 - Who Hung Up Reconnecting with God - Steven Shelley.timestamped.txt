[0:00] even when you can't see me even when you
[0:02] can't feel me even when it's only every
[0:05] now and again that you feel the tug on
[0:07] the other end of the line but you'll
[0:08] know he's there because his word said
[0:12] so I may not be able to walk on water
[0:15] but I can walk on a word as long as it
[0:18] comes from him if he said come then he's
[0:21] going to take care of me if I sink he's
[0:24] going to catch me if I drown he's going
[0:26] to revive me I'm not going to worry
[0:29] about it turns out I'm just going to
[0:31] know that in the end he's I am
[0:34] Hallelujah he's still
[0:36] able and I'm going to step out I I I
[0:39] I've got a word I've got a word I've got
[0:42] a word nobody has a word like this
[0:45] little bride that we can stand on not
[0:48] just when things are good but when
[0:50] they're
[0:51] hellish when hounds of hell are against
[0:55] you when your family's falling apart
[0:58] when your children are backslid and
[1:00] running after the world when your body
[1:02] is failing you that's the
[1:05] hour to step out on the
[1:09] word so if we're feeling disconnected
[1:12] and sometimes we do this is not to to
[1:15] condemn you or to judge you or even to
[1:19] blame you but who else are we going to
[1:21] blame if we can't blame him because he
[1:24] said I'll always be with you I'll go
[1:27] with you even to the end of the world we
[1:29] know he he'll never leave us he'll never
[1:31] forsake us then if we're disconnected
[1:34] who hung
[1:35] up who ghosted who who forgot to stay
[1:40] connected to the
[1:42] vine he said if you abide in me and my
[1:45] words abide in
[1:48] you and and that means there there that
[1:51] if is there it's that small little word
[1:53] that says you've got to do this there is
[1:56] a prerequisite there is a requirement in
[1:58] this hour and even though the book is
[2:01] opened and even though the revelation we
[2:03] have from God is Rich there's still the
[2:06] possibility that in the midst of all of
[2:08] this revelation we hang up or we somehow
[2:12] disconnect ourselves from fellowship
[2:15] with him listen church God is not just
[2:18] about relationship he's also about
[2:21] fellowship and if you don't believe that
[2:23] just remember he came down in the cool
[2:26] of the evening he was already Papa he
[2:29] was already God to Adam and to Eve but
[2:33] now he wanted to be in fellowship with
[2:36] them it's a reason why the God above us
[2:40] became a god with us and eventually a
[2:42] God in us because he was looking for
[2:45] fellowship and so when we replace him
[2:49] with all of the other pretties in life
[2:52] and with all of the other distractions
[2:54] in life then it's really us who pushes
[2:57] him to the back of the closet it's it's
[2:59] really us who says I don't have time to
[3:02] read today I don't have time to pray
[3:04] today well I want you to know if you
[3:06] don't read every day if you don't pray
[3:09] every day if you don't hear even a small
[3:11] portion of the word every day it won't
[3:14] take a week to be
[3:16] disconnected I want you to know that
[3:18] it's just as easy to
[3:20] reconnect he's as close as a mention of
[3:23] his name he's as close as the opening of
[3:26] his word you just have to focus on him
[3:29] you have to turn your attention away
[3:31] from all the other things in life that
[3:33] grab us in this hour and you have to set
[3:36] aside time for him your time with him is
[3:39] more important than the time with your
[3:41] boyfriend or your girlfriend or your
[3:43] husband or your wife or your siblings
[3:46] come on it's more important than your
[3:48] Christmas
[3:50] meal
[3:52] fellowship with him abiding in him and
[3:57] him abiding in you
