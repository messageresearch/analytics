[32:36] We give you praise and adoration
[32:40] because you are holy.
[32:44] You are righteous.
[32:50] the price you paid at Calvary. Lord,
[33:01] everything that you went through leading
[33:04] up to Calvary
[33:06] were temptations
[33:08] such as is common to man, yet you had no
[33:12] sin.
[33:15] And I thank you, Lord, that you bore our
[33:17] sin to Calvary.
[33:22] And as you your body laid in that tomb,
[33:28] you were taking care of business
[33:33] in paradise
[33:35] and in the lower regions of the earth.
[33:39] Lord, I thank you
[33:41] that you have the keys. You took the
[33:44] keys
[33:46] of death and hell and the grave.
[33:53] And now we don't stand here today in our
[33:55] own righteousness,
[33:58] but we stand
[34:00] in your righteousness,
[34:04] complete
[34:05] and perfect.
[34:08] Oh yes, we have to walk it out.
[34:12] But I thank you, Lord, that I don't have
[34:14] to strive today
[34:16] trying to come to you perfect enough to
[34:19] present my worship.
[34:22] But I thank you that because of your
[34:24] righteousness
[34:26] as I lift my hands to you, Lord,
[34:30] my sacrifice of worship
[34:34] is honorable to you because of the
[34:36] righteousness that I walk in. Because of
[34:39] you,
[34:41] I give you praise, Lord.
[34:44] I give you praise.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:51] To God be glory.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Great things. He has done
[34:56] &gt;&gt; and is doing and will continue to do
[35:00] because he is
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[35:07] and today.
[35:09] and forever.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; Do you have a need on your heart today
[35:12] by the lifting of a hand that you'd want
[35:15] us to remember? Needs all over the
[35:17] house, out across the stream. The needs
[35:21] that you have, our heavenly father knows
[35:24] them and he knows how to meet them.
[35:27] He's the one that we can talk to
[35:31] and he'll hear us answer prayer.
[35:35] We want to pray for all of those that
[35:37] are affected by these storms that the
[35:40] Lord will have mercy on whom he will
[35:42] have mercy and pardon on whom he will
[35:45] pardon.
[35:46] Sister Kathy texted to say she was not
[35:49] feeling well today. Let's remember her
[35:52] to the Lord in prayer. Please continue
[35:54] to remember
[35:56] the situation in Jerusalem that God will
[35:59] give us a total breakthrough.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I have paperwork on my desk
[36:02] that's very promising, but I'm waiting
[36:06] to hear from someone in Jerusalem who I
[36:09] need I need their help and they're slow
[36:13] to responding. So, I need the Lord to
[36:15] move in that area and we're going to
[36:17] have a need soon perhaps before next
[36:20] Sunday to be able to cover some of the
[36:22] expenses if we are able to uh renew the
[36:26] lease. And it looks like we may be able
[36:28] to, the Lord willing, Jonathan will be
[36:31] leaving uh sometime early February to go
[36:35] to the apartment and start he's going
[36:37] alone to start sorting through some of
[36:39] the things. And I'll go later, but it
[36:42] does look like that God is making a way.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; For us to keep it yet another another
[36:47] lease cycle.
[36:50] I feel like it's more important. I
[36:52] haven't always felt this way, but I feel
[36:54] like it's more important now than ever.
[36:58] And I also feel like that it is somehow
[37:01] redemption.
[37:03] You know, we never never really I never
[37:06] went back really to reclaim our position
[37:10] in in Jerusalem. And I'm believing
[37:12] somehow this is the year spiritually
[37:16] to do that. And we need God to
[37:19] move in the ways I've mentioned. and and
[37:22] maybe some I haven't mentioned, but he's
[37:24] able.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; More than able. Remember the meetings
[37:29] that are coming up that God would move
[37:30] and just release an extra service, but
[37:33] there'll be a little extra fellowship to
[37:35] go along with it. God's perfect plan be
[37:38] done.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:41] We take these needs to our papa. Let's
[37:44] sing the chorus of this song.
[37:48] in the presence
[37:55] of
[37:57] Jehovah,
[38:02] God
[38:04] Almighty,
[38:09] Prince of Peace,
[38:17] trust Trles
[38:18] vanish,
[38:24] hearts
[38:26] are mened
[38:31] in the presence
[38:38] of
[38:40] brother Hulk. Will you come and pray
[38:42] today, please?
[38:45] in the presence
[38:53] of Jehovah,
[39:00] God
[39:01] Almighty,
[39:07] Prince of Peace,
[39:14] trust Trles
[39:16] vanish.
[39:21] Hearts
[39:23] are mened
[39:28] in the presence
[39:35] of
[39:39] God. Holy God. Holy God. Holy God.
[39:46] We're just so thankful, Lord,
[39:50] that we can come before our king.
[39:59] As Benjamin was praying earlier, he was
[40:01] praying that we would come
[40:04] in one mind and one accord.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; And that is what I prayed before the
[40:12] service today.
[40:15] that we as your people will come to you
[40:18] Lord in one mind to seek you Lord.
[40:25] Seek your heart
[40:29] that you would have your way in our
[40:32] midst.
[40:38] Lord, I just pray also for the purposes
[40:42] of God for this house for Israel.
[40:47] You by your own spirit have spoken so
[40:51] many things
[40:53] and Lord, you're true to your word,
[40:56] but you're waiting for people to
[40:58] participate
[41:02] with your word to grab a hold of it by
[41:05] faith.
[41:09] people that are led by your spirit and
[41:12] when we Lord obey something happens.
[41:16] Would you give us a quickening heart
[41:19] that is quickened by your spirit and we
[41:22] would be quick to respond?
[41:25] That you would find people that you can
[41:27] trust.
[41:30] I am amazed that you, oh Lord, would
[41:32] come to this earth and you showed us how
[41:35] to do this life.
[41:40] You showed us what what it is to be a
[41:43] son of God.
[41:47] But what is amazing also Lord, it was
[41:50] always the plan that you would come into
[41:54] us and give us the strength.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; To do exactly what you did to be
[42:01] obedient
[42:04] and to walk out this journey.
[42:07] Lord, I also pray for all of us in this
[42:10] house that we we could see
[42:15] the end
[42:18] that we would not be bogged down by
[42:21] today,
[42:23] &gt;&gt; but be strengthened in our inner man
[42:26] because of the hope that is before us.
[42:29] It's your completed body
[42:32] in perfect state.
[42:35] I thank you for overcoming power that
[42:38] you have that you have given because of
[42:41] redemption
[42:43] &gt;&gt; and that is what I pray for everyone in
[42:46] this house. Would you just minister to
[42:49] all of your people today, oh God, there
[42:52] are different needs in this body, but
[42:55] you are so personal. You know
[42:58] everything, every little detail. And so
[43:01] according to your wisdom and your grace,
[43:03] would you minister Lord by your spirit?
[43:08] And again I pray for Jerusalem
[43:12] &gt;&gt; a strategy that comes from
[43:15] above.
[43:16] Would you lead? Would you guide? Would
[43:19] you open up the way the provision and
[43:22] let the purposes of God in Jerusalem for
[43:25] this ministry unfold? May we step into
[43:28] it right now. Lord, may this be the time
[43:32] I pray in the name of Yeshua
[43:36] &gt;&gt; that is higher, that is stronger. And I
[43:40] just thank you. We're partaker of that
[43:42] name.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; What a plan. I bless you, oh God. In the
[43:48] name of Yeshua, I pray. Amen.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[43:57] We give you praise, Lord.
[44:01] We give you praise Lord.
[44:05] Worthy, worthy, worthy is the lamb.
[44:11] Hallelujah.
[44:14] You may have your seats today.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; What a blessing it is to be in the house
[44:20] of the Lord.
[44:22] Sister Flo, we invite you to come and
[44:24] sing while she's getting ready to come
[44:27] and sing today. We want to welcome you
[44:30] to this house. Brother Jerry already,
[44:33] it's good to see you. The Lord bless
[44:35] you. We're glad you're in the house of
[44:36] the Lord with us today.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; And uh let's see. Chris and Annie and
[44:42] Rebecca, we're glad that you're here
[44:43] today. The Lord bless you.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; We're glad that you could be in the
[44:46] house of the Lord with us today.
[44:50] While Sister Flo is getting ready to
[44:53] sing, I just want to remind you that we
[44:57] have a week of cold weather coming.
[45:01] And uh just just a public service
[45:04] announcement to you. Do do you have a
[45:06] picture there, Maya, that you can flash
[45:08] up there?
[45:10] This is a beneficial piece for you to
[45:13] put on your faucets. They are somewhat
[45:16] expensive. But I am telling you this
[45:18] because I have found them to be such a
[45:21] blessing
[45:23] &gt;&gt; because you put it on your faucet and
[45:25] you turn the faucet on completely. As
[45:28] long as it is warm, they will not run.
[45:31] But as the temperature comes down, then
[45:33] it begins to drip of its own accord. And
[45:35] then as it gets colder, it gives a
[45:38] heavier flow of water to keep your
[45:40] faucet from freezing. The uh low uh Home
[45:44] Depot is lowest stock, but Lowe's in
[45:46] Columbus and in Opaikica seem to have
[45:49] plenty of them. But they are a
[45:51] worthwhile investment for you so that
[45:53] you do not have to go out and try to
[45:56] make your faucet drip right every night.
[45:58] You just put it on there, turn the
[45:59] faucet on completely and it you can
[46:02] leave it all week. Uh I have it on my
[46:04] own building that has no heat in it and
[46:06] it works so beautifully. So uh just I I
[46:10] tell you that because we don't want
[46:12] broken water pipes not on this ground
[46:14] and not at your home. We just are
[46:17] offering that advice to you. Let's
[46:19] worship together as sister. They say
[46:21] that it's even more effective than than
[46:24] covering than those little insulated
[46:26] things that you buy. They say it's way
[46:28] more effective than those.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; I I have found it to be a great
[46:31] blessing.
[46:39] This is a new song and I'm praying that
[46:41] I'll do the Lord justice.
[46:44] Do good. But I want to tell you this
[46:47] year in August I'll be 88 years old
[46:52] and I've tried this and I'm here to tell
[46:56] you it works.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; It works.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; It works.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; So you pray for me. If I don't do good,
[47:02] I know you'll forgive me. I thought
[47:03] about that this morning. the devil, you
[47:05] know how he comes at you when you try to
[47:07] do something for the Lord. And so I
[47:09] said, "Well, they love me and they'll
[47:11] forgive me." So, you know, well, let's
[47:13] walk on. Walk on for Jesus. But
[47:16] remember,
[47:18] when you get down and out, this works.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; What I'm fixing to tell you works. Try
[47:23] it out.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Dare you to. I dare you to
[47:31] maestro.
[47:38] Praise God. Help me, Lord.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; When you're up against the wall and the
[47:51] mountains seem so tall and it seems like
[47:56] life's not always fair.
[48:01] You can run away and hide.
[48:05] Let the old man decide.
[48:09] Or you can change your circumstances
[48:12] with a prayer.
[48:18] When everything falls apart,
[48:23] praise his name.
[48:25] When you have a broken heart,
[48:29] just raise your hands and say,
[48:33] "Lord, you're all I need.
[48:36] You're everything to me." And he'll take
[48:41] the pain away.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; When it seems you call alone,
[48:52] &gt;&gt; praise his name.
[48:55] When you feel you can't go on,
[48:58] just raise your hands and say,
[49:02] "Greater
[49:04] is he
[49:06] that is within me."
[49:10] And you'll take the pain away.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; If you'll just praise his name.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:25] Oh Jesus.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; You can overcome
[49:42] by the blood of the lamb.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; And by the word of your testimony.
[49:53] You'll see the darkness go
[49:56] &gt;&gt; as your faith begins to grow.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; You're not alone. So how can you be
[50:04] lonely?
[50:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; When everything falls apart,
[50:15] praise his name. When you have a broken
[50:19] heart,
[50:21] just raise your hands and say,
[50:25] "Lord, you're all I need.
[50:29] You're everything to me."
[50:32] And he'll take the pain away.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, you will.
[50:40] When it seems you're all alone,
[50:45] praise his name. When you feel you can't
[50:49] go on,
[50:51] just raise your hands and say
[50:59] &gt;&gt; that is within me.
[51:02] And you'll praise the heart away.
[51:14] If you'll just praise his name.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; It's a truth.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord.
[51:38] It's the truth.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with that.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:52] I have found that it works.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; It works.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Sister Flo.
[52:05] headed toward 88 years old and still
[52:07] learning new songs
[52:10] &gt;&gt; to come and sing
[52:13] &gt;&gt; for the Lord.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; It's a marvelous thing. Beautiful.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Cade, are you slipping away? All
[52:21] right, we're getting ready to receive
[52:24] the tithe and offering.
[52:28] Something that we do every service.
[52:31] received the tithe and the offering. You
[52:34] are faithful to give to the Lord. We
[52:36] honor you. We bless you.
[52:39] We don't want it to be just something
[52:41] that is common, but it is part of our
[52:44] covenant with the Lord, giving of our
[52:46] tithe and our offering to him. It's what
[52:51] believers do. They're not stingy. They
[52:54] give to the Lord. They give to each
[52:57] other. They're generous. It's part of
[52:59] the word of God. And that's what we're
[53:01] going to do today. Brother Ellias, will
[53:03] you help us please? Brother Jonathan,
[53:05] would you also help him go to the people
[53:07] to give of the tithe and offering as
[53:09] brother Kate is singing and we're
[53:10] worshiping getting our hearts ready for
[53:13] the the word. We're not just starting at
[53:16] this moment. We've already been in
[53:18] process. As as we pause just a moment
[53:22] while brother Benjamin was leading us in
[53:25] worship, I could feel
[53:27] &gt;&gt; that rhythm of the spirit. Oh,
[53:30] hallelujah.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; That brother Brandham talked about that
[53:33] he had a recording made of. I could I
[53:35] could hear it rising. I want it to
[53:38] happen with frequency that we get on the
[53:42] winds of the spirit and ride higher and
[53:44] higher and higher. Let's ride higher on
[53:47] the in the spirit as we're preparing to
[53:49] hear the word of the Lord today.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:56] People
[54:11] said I never make it.
[54:18] Said I'd never see it through.
[54:25] But they don't know what keeps me going.
[54:32] I guess they never have met you.
[54:40] All my life was in shambles
[54:47] until the day you came along.
[54:56] turned my tears into laughter
[55:01] and you gave me a brand new song.
[55:11] I'm still holding on.
[55:16] Lord, I'll never let you go.
[55:25] You gave me a smile.
[55:30] You touched my heart. You touched my
[55:33] soul.
[55:38] And those bridges
[55:40] behind me,
[55:45] Lord, I burn them to the ground.
[55:54] I'm still holding
[55:57] on.
[56:00] You're the best thing I ever found.
[56:07] Voted likely not to prosper.
[56:11] Have you ever been there?
[56:14] Was left hanging over my head.
[56:22] You'll never count for nothing.
[56:28] That's what most people said.
[56:36] I've been known to be unsettled.
[56:42] I never stay around too long.
[56:50] You're the treasure I've been searching
[56:54] for.
[56:57] Lord, I'm still holding on.
[57:04] Oh, and I'm still holding
[57:09] on.
[57:11] Lord, I'll never let you go. Oh,
[57:20] but you gave me a smile.
[57:26] You touched my heart. You touched my
[57:28] soul.
[57:33] And all those bridges left behind me.
[57:40] Oh Lord, I burn them to the ground.
[57:47] Oh,
[57:49] cuz I'm still holding
[57:52] on.
[57:55] You're the best thing I ever found.
[58:02] People said I never make it.
[58:09] Said I'd never see it through.
[58:16] They don't know what keeps me going.
[58:23] I guess they never have met you.
[58:30] Well, my life was in shambles
[58:38] till the day you came along.
[58:45] turned my tears into laughter.
[58:52] And you gave me a brand new song,
[58:59] Lord. And I'm still holding
[59:03] on.
[59:06] And Lord, I'll never let you go. Oh.
[59:14] Oh. And you gave me a smile.
[59:20] You touched my heart. You touched my
[59:23] soul.
[59:27] With all those bridges left behind me.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. I burn them to the ground.
[59:40] burn. Oh yes.
[59:42] Oh, cuz I'm still holding
[59:46] on.
[59:49] You're the best thing I ever found.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Sing that chorus again. Sing it with
[59:55] him. I'm still holding on.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; And I'm still holding
[1:00:01] on.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; I am.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; But I'll never let you go. Oh Lord,
[1:00:09] thank you for holding on to me
[1:00:12] cuz you gave me a smile.
[1:00:17] Lordise,
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; touch my heart. You touch my soul.
[1:00:23] All those bridges, all those bridges
[1:00:26] left behind
[1:00:29] me.
[1:00:31] That's right. Oh Lord, I burn them to
[1:00:34] the ground.
[1:00:38] Oh,
[1:00:41] cuz I'm still holding
[1:00:44] on.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Still holding on.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; You're the best thing I ever found.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, you are.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; All those bridges left behind me.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I burn them to the ground.
[1:01:08] Yes, Lord.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm still holding
[1:01:13] on.
[1:01:17] You're the best thing I ever found.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, you are. Yes, you are, Lord.
[1:01:27] Yes, you are, Lord. Yes, you are.
[1:01:31] Lord, if there's ever a time that we
[1:01:34] cannot hold on to you, you promised and
[1:01:37] you have proven yourself faithful
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; to hold on to us
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; and we're very thankful for that. You
[1:01:45] may be seated for just a moment.
[1:01:49] He is faithful in all of his ways.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; I want to say it again so that you'll
[1:01:54] hear me this time. He is faithful in all
[1:01:58] of his ways. Amen.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; If you're here this morning, I want you
[1:02:02] to participate
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; in this service because you may need it
[1:02:06] worse than anybody else and not know it
[1:02:09] yet.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Before we gather here Tuesday night, you
[1:02:13] might be the one who needed this
[1:02:15] atmosphere the most.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; And so, I just ask those of you who are
[1:02:19] here uh to spend as much time with us in
[1:02:23] the sanctuary as you can. um not so much
[1:02:27] time in the other rooms of the church.
[1:02:30] The nurseries are cry rooms. They're not
[1:02:33] uh spend the afternoon rooms. And so I
[1:02:36] would very much appreciate it if you
[1:02:38] would uh take care of your baby as
[1:02:40] quickly as you can and come back into
[1:02:42] the service. Uh there are churches who
[1:02:44] operate nurseries and that's a place
[1:02:46] that you can either drop your baby off,
[1:02:48] your child off or or stay with them uh
[1:02:51] through the whole service. But we we
[1:02:53] really have cry rooms. And that is when
[1:02:55] they're fussy or when they're hungry. If
[1:02:58] we train them that every time they uh
[1:03:01] burp,
[1:03:02] we're going to take them out and keep
[1:03:04] them out the rest of the service, we're
[1:03:05] doing them an injustice.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; And so I'm just asking you with all the
[1:03:10] love that I can muster. And I mean it. I
[1:03:13] don't I'm not asking in a condemning way
[1:03:14] or a judgmental way, but we need this
[1:03:18] atmosphere.
[1:03:20] I don't believe it takes two people to
[1:03:22] take care of one baby.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; And if you've got a baby that needs two
[1:03:27] people to take care of them, you might
[1:03:29] ought to want to have that evaluated a
[1:03:31] little bit. Uh because uh I don't think
[1:03:34] it's really necessary. So let's spend as
[1:03:37] much time as we can in the Well, I'm not
[1:03:39] feeling it. Doesn't I don't think I
[1:03:41] mentioned feeling yet.
[1:03:43] uh because I have found out whether I
[1:03:45] feel him or not, I'm changed
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; when I'm in his presence.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; And uh now it's more effective when I
[1:03:53] connect.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Way more effective. But it but he soaks
[1:03:57] in me. I'm a sponge anyway by nature. I
[1:04:00] hope you are. We can't make it without
[1:04:03] him. If you think you can coast in 2026,
[1:04:07] you've missed it. Brother, sister, this
[1:04:09] is not time to even want to coast.
[1:04:13] And uh if you if you need to be uh
[1:04:16] nursed along and uh you know propped up
[1:04:19] all the time, you need another
[1:04:21] experience with the Lord.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; And that's not judgment either because
[1:04:26] there's one available for you.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; And I think sometimes we put it off
[1:04:31] because we know it it's going to cost us
[1:04:33] a little something. It may cost you a
[1:04:35] little sleep. You come see my eyes. It
[1:04:38] may cost you a little sleep and uh it
[1:04:42] may make you a nervous sort of person
[1:04:44] sometime, but it's worth it. It's worth
[1:04:48] it to to reach out for another
[1:04:51] installment of who he is.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; I want you to know God didn't send a
[1:04:56] message of restoration for us to become
[1:04:59] a denominational people.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; And uh maybe you were looking for a
[1:05:04] church when you came. Well, you'll never
[1:05:06] be satisfied here because I didn't want
[1:05:08] a church. A church is just a institute.
[1:05:11] God never inst I don't see anywhere in
[1:05:14] the Bible
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; where God says that church is his idea.
[1:05:19] It's meeting together in his name with
[1:05:21] expectation and anticipation
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; uh to meet him and to encounter him. And
[1:05:29] we have to have a building to do it in.
[1:05:30] You all wouldn't fit in my living room.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; And so we have to have a building. But
[1:05:35] but this this is not an institution.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; This is a living.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; It's coinia. It's a living moving
[1:05:44] breathing organism. And if you try to
[1:05:46] make it a structure, he leaves.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; And if he doesn't leave me, he'll leave
[1:05:51] you. If he doesn't leave you, he leave.
[1:05:54] It's it's a it's an hour that we want to
[1:05:57] be as circumspect as we possibly can.
[1:06:00] And uh I only have two days a week to
[1:06:03] speak to you. And um I want to use this
[1:06:06] time as wisely as I possibly can. So I'm
[1:06:09] not wasting breath here. I'm telling you
[1:06:11] the urgency of this hour. Uh we are once
[1:06:14] again and have been now for several
[1:06:16] months on the precipice of something
[1:06:18] that God has been trying to bring us to
[1:06:20] for over 20 years. And every time we get
[1:06:24] right up to the door, one or two things
[1:06:26] happen. One of two things happen. either
[1:06:29] someone raises up to to stop us with
[1:06:32] some kind of spirit or uh we have some
[1:06:36] division that comes uh to some of the
[1:06:39] families or to some of the folks and uh
[1:06:42] we're there again. But we know that God
[1:06:44] is going to take us all the way
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; because our eyes aren't on people.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; If you get your eyes on me, I will
[1:06:53] disappoint you probably seven days a
[1:06:54] week.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; But if you'll put your eyes on him,
[1:06:58] I tell you, he never fails.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Uh, ask brother Jerry. When we fail, he
[1:07:04] doesn't turn us loose.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; He reaches, his hand reaches farther
[1:07:09] down.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; That old song from the depths of the
[1:07:12] pit. I tried so hard, but I couldn't
[1:07:14] touch him. But his hand reached farther
[1:07:17] down
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; than I could reach up. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:07:22] It is not a mystery that I can love him
[1:07:25] the way I love him today. But it is a
[1:07:27] mystery to me how he can love me the way
[1:07:29] he loves me today. And his love is is
[1:07:33] steadfast. It is divine. It is perfect
[1:07:36] love. And without perfect love. Without
[1:07:39] that we're not going going to have a
[1:07:42] rapture. We're not going in a rapture
[1:07:44] without perfect love.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; And it's not easy. It's it's it's not
[1:07:49] something you can just sit down and, you
[1:07:51] know, fist up and grunt and wrinkle your
[1:07:55] forehead and I'm going to I'm going to
[1:07:56] have perfect love.
[1:07:58] No, no, no. You You're going to have to
[1:08:00] have the birth pains all the way up to
[1:08:02] the top.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Every dimension of his character
[1:08:07] requires another birthing process.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I thought it was just
[1:08:12] one birth." It is into eternal life. But
[1:08:15] into full adoption, there's births all
[1:08:18] the way to the capping of this pyramid,
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; into the stature of the perfect man.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going there by God's grace. And you
[1:08:28] have to kind of have an attitude
[1:08:29] sometime. I'm going if I go by myself.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; If nobody else goes, I have to go. I
[1:08:35] have to inherit it.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; He's going to have preeminence in my
[1:08:39] life or I'm going to cut things out uh
[1:08:42] until he does.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:45] I am because we're at the end of this
[1:08:48] thing.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Aren't we blessed to not be
[1:08:52] frozen under today?
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; And we could still have some stormy
[1:08:57] weather. Somebody's I just got another
[1:09:00] notification. There'll be tornado
[1:09:02] watches this afternoon. Uh I'm not going
[1:09:04] to be watching for any
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; because if you watch for them, you might
[1:09:09] see them. But I'm going to be prepared
[1:09:12] uh that if I uh I know one time they one
[1:09:16] one come through this area and I was
[1:09:19] having lunch with the Gies at Taziki
[1:09:22] and the only way we knew that it was
[1:09:24] getting bad is when we went to open the
[1:09:25] door and the door we could hardly close
[1:09:27] the door. The wind had kicked up. I
[1:09:30] said, "Hey, something's going on here."
[1:09:33] And then we began to hear what was
[1:09:35] happening. God brought us through
[1:09:37] safely. A few years back, we had a
[1:09:40] tornado on Saturday and snow on Sunday.
[1:09:43] And I was in Tucson and missed it all.
[1:09:45] Hallelujah.
[1:09:47] But I saw the map and I saw Alabama just
[1:09:49] sitting there so pretty with all the
[1:09:52] frozen folk around us and we are praying
[1:09:54] for them. But uh I believe God heard
[1:09:56] somebody's prayer. Right.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you were praying or not,
[1:10:00] but I heard Benjamin more than one time
[1:10:02] say, "I'm asking you, Lord, that we
[1:10:05] would be able to have church on Sunday
[1:10:06] and that that weather would not hinder
[1:10:08] us from being in your house."
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; And God heard that prayer.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful. I'm very thankful. Let's
[1:10:14] stand again. I I know you were just
[1:10:17] standing
[1:10:18] uh but
[1:10:22] we're getting ready to go to the word.
[1:10:24] And if you were not here Tuesday night,
[1:10:27] I have some uh contribution statements
[1:10:30] here for Sister Annie, for brother Jason
[1:10:33] and and uh and your son has one here and
[1:10:36] brother Michael and sister Crystal,
[1:10:38] Nathan and Joanna Jacob Hendris has one
[1:10:42] and Levi who who's not here I don't
[1:10:44] think today maybe but the Mans and
[1:10:48] Sister Tiffany and brother Austin and
[1:10:56] and Josiah.
[1:10:58] So, uh, brother, you're always willing
[1:11:01] to help. Brother Ellias, would you go
[1:11:03] lay those on the back table back there?
[1:11:05] And if I called your name, get yours on
[1:11:08] your way out today.
[1:11:12] And it's uh on you. Now, I uh have
[1:11:16] emailed and I have mailed some. And if
[1:11:18] there's any problem with yours,
[1:11:20] something left off, wrong check number,
[1:11:23] uh we called it a check and it was a uh
[1:11:26] online, anything like that, all you have
[1:11:29] to do is let us know and we'll be glad
[1:11:31] to to help you get that corrected.
[1:11:35] Uh why don't we just sing uh uh just a a
[1:11:40] just something simple?
[1:11:42] Why don't we sing again? And they that
[1:11:44] wait upon the Lord shall renew their
[1:11:47] strength. As we get ready to go to the
[1:11:49] word, I only saw one birthday this week.
[1:11:52] There may be more, but I could only find
[1:11:54] one on the calendar, and that was Sister
[1:11:56] Megan. And that's on Thursday,
[1:12:00] January the 29th.
[1:12:02] And so, we want to wish her a very happy
[1:12:05] birthday. And uh you don't look your
[1:12:08] age, so that's good. You can thank God
[1:12:10] for that. and and I um I think that I
[1:12:16] really look mine until I see some other
[1:12:18] folks and then I think, "Wow, I'm
[1:12:21] looking amazing these days."
[1:12:24] If he's younger than I am, nobody told
[1:12:26] him. I'm telling you, he is. But anyway,
[1:12:29] God is good. What does it matter? I have
[1:12:31] another one waiting on me.
[1:12:34] They that wait
[1:12:37] upon the Lord shall renew.
[1:12:43] Oh, I'm a multi-agle, Lord. I need to
[1:12:46] renew my strength.
[1:12:50] I need to scratch my talons on the rock
[1:12:52] of ages.
[1:12:54] I need to scrape my beak on that rock
[1:12:57] until I can breathe the very oxygen of
[1:13:00] heaven.
[1:13:02] They shall walk
[1:13:05] and not
[1:13:08] Oh, teach me, Lord. Teach me, Lord. I'm
[1:13:11] still learning
[1:13:14] to wait. That sounds so good again. Oh,
[1:13:18] they that wait upon the Lord.
[1:13:30] They shall now
[1:13:36] as he goes.
[1:13:40] They shall run and not be weary.
[1:13:47] They shall walk and not faint. Teach me,
[1:13:51] Lord. Teach me, Lord.
[1:13:55] Teach me Lord
[1:13:58] to wait again. Do you mind one more
[1:14:01] time? They that wait they that wait.
[1:14:07] I'm waiting on you. Jesus shall renew.
[1:14:13] They shall mount.
[1:14:21] He goes,
[1:14:24] they shall run.
[1:14:29] Woo! I'm going to run. I'm going to run
[1:14:33] on.
[1:14:35] Glory be to God. Teach me, Lord.
[1:14:40] Teach me, Lord.
[1:14:45] I'm coming up
[1:14:49] on the rough side
[1:14:53] of the mountain.
[1:14:58] Oh, I must hold
[1:15:00] to God
[1:15:03] his powerful hand.
[1:15:07] Oh, I'm coming up.
[1:15:11] I am on the rough side
[1:15:16] of the mountain.
[1:15:19] Woo! But I'm doing my best. Let's go up
[1:15:25] one.
[1:15:28] Oh, I'm coming up.
[1:15:31] Coming up, Jesus on the rough side
[1:15:36] of the mountain.
[1:15:40] Oh, I'm going to hold to God
[1:15:46] his powerful hand.
[1:15:50] Oh, I'm coming up
[1:15:55] on the rough side
[1:15:59] of the mountain
[1:16:03] and I'm doing my best. Are you doing
[1:16:08] your best? Sing it if you are. I'm
[1:16:11] coming up. Coming up, Jesus on the rough
[1:16:16] side.
[1:16:18] Woo. That's where sons are formed.
[1:16:22] Yes, sir. I'm going to hold
[1:16:25] to God,
[1:16:28] his powerful hand.
[1:16:32] I'm coming up.
[1:16:35] Woo! On the rough side.
[1:16:41] of the mountain
[1:16:45] and I
[1:16:50] one more time
[1:16:52] I'm coming up
[1:16:57] on the rough side
[1:17:00] of the mountain
[1:17:04] I'm going to hold till
[1:17:10] his powerful hand.
[1:17:14] I'm coming up
[1:17:18] over the rough side
[1:17:23] of the mountain.
[1:17:25] Here I come, Lord God, doing my best
[1:17:31] again. We're coming on up, Lord. I'm
[1:17:34] coming up
[1:17:38] on the rough side.
[1:17:45] Woo! Oh, I'm going to hold
[1:17:49] to God
[1:17:52] his powerful hand.
[1:17:56] I'm coming up. Coming up. Jesus on the
[1:18:01] right side.
[1:18:04] of the mountain.
[1:18:08] And I'm doing my best.
[1:18:15] I said I'm doing my best to make it.
[1:18:23] Lord,
[1:18:26] that's all we can do.
[1:18:28] That's all we can do.
[1:18:31] If you'll give God your best, he'll do
[1:18:34] the rest.
[1:18:36] Give him your best.
[1:18:39] Give him all you've got.
[1:18:42] And he'll do the rest. I know he will.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; You give him your best, he'll do the
[1:18:53] rest.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; I know he will.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; I know he will. How do you know? because
[1:18:58] he's been doing it for me for over 50
[1:19:01] years.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; And didn't quit him
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; and he kept me.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't go through a period of
[1:19:13] not being in church
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; and he kept me.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; I put him first and he kept me.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; And and he always will.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; When my attitude was good, he kept me.
[1:19:26] But when it wasn't so good, he kept me
[1:19:28] anyway.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; That's who he is.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; You've got to understand abiding.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; We're abiding in the vine.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; We're not just connected for Sunday and
[1:19:42] Tuesday.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; We're living in that vine. The life of
[1:19:45] the vine. Isn't he great?
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's thank God for anointed
[1:19:50] musicians.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; We don't have to drag them.
[1:19:57] Turn with me to Joshua chapter 1.
[1:20:03] You thought I was going to Judges.
[1:20:09] Joshua chapter 1
[1:20:12] 12:19.
[1:20:14] I want to make a note of that
[1:20:17] so that it's when it's 3:19 I'll be sure
[1:20:20] to be stopped.
[1:20:22] 12:19
[1:20:25] Now after the death of Moses, the
[1:20:27] servant of the Lord, it came to pass
[1:20:31] that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son
[1:20:35] of Non, Moses minister, saying, Moses,
[1:20:39] my servant is dead. Now, do you think
[1:20:43] that Joshua didn't know that?
[1:20:48] I think he probably knew it.
[1:20:50] Why would God have to state the obvious?
[1:20:53] I find that he has to do that very often
[1:20:56] with me.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; He has to state the obvious to me and
[1:21:00] for me a lot of time because I have a
[1:21:03] hard time accepting change and sometimes
[1:21:06] I have a hard time accepting reality.
[1:21:10] Come on.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; You could have said yes you do. If you
[1:21:13] can't say if you can't say me too, you
[1:21:16] could say yes you do. You can say
[1:21:18] something. So God has to come to to
[1:21:21] Joshua and has I got a feeling it
[1:21:24] thundered. Moses, my servant, is dead.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; So quit your whining
[1:21:35] and your crying and your belly aching
[1:21:38] and get on up there and do what I've
[1:21:40] called you to do."
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now therefore, arise. Get up.
[1:21:45] Get up out of your grief. Get up out of
[1:21:48] your despondency.
[1:21:50] Get up out of your Well, I don't know
[1:21:53] which way to go. You do know which way
[1:21:55] to go. The way was made clear through
[1:21:57] Moses.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; You just get up and follow in the way.
[1:22:03] Go over this Jordan, thou and all this
[1:22:07] people unto the land which I do give to
[1:22:10] them, even to the children of Israel.
[1:22:14] This isn't the first body of water that
[1:22:16] God had to supernaturally make a way
[1:22:18] through.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; And the Jordan was nothing in comparison
[1:22:22] to the Red Sea. If God brought him
[1:22:25] through the Red Sea, he knows how to get
[1:22:27] them to the other side of Jordan.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Moses was not to go through.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; And so it was now that Moses is gone and
[1:22:38] uh Joshua is the man.
[1:22:42] And this was a hard responsibility to
[1:22:45] fall on his shoulders. I don't think he
[1:22:47] wanted it. I don't think he was zealous
[1:22:50] to have it, but I think he was willing
[1:22:52] to be obedient.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Are you willing today if God should call
[1:22:56] on you to do something more than you're
[1:22:58] comfortable with? Would you be willing
[1:23:01] to do it? We must be. We must be
[1:23:04] willing.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. He it goes on every place
[1:23:09] that the soul of your foot shall tread
[1:23:13] upon
[1:23:14] you. You you you can't tread on anything
[1:23:17] while you're sitting down.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; So God said, "Get up, Joshua. Arise."
[1:23:22] And now you can't just stand there.
[1:23:24] You've got to move your feet
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; because every place that the soul of
[1:23:29] your foot shall tread upon, that have I
[1:23:32] given unto you as I said unto Moses. I
[1:23:37] promised it to him. I'm going to bring
[1:23:40] it to fulfillment through you.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; So get up and get to walking.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. from the wilderness and this
[1:23:48] Lebanon, even under the great river, the
[1:23:51] river Euphrates, all the land of the
[1:23:53] Hittites, under the great sea, toward
[1:23:56] the going down of the sun, shall be your
[1:23:59] coast. There shall not any man be able
[1:24:02] to stand before thee all the days of thy
[1:24:06] life. As I was with Moses,
[1:24:11] so I will be with thee. I will not fail
[1:24:16] thee.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Nor forsake thee.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; As they were singing this morning, it
[1:24:24] didn't say you won't ever feel alone,
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; but you're not alone.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; How many of you have ever felt alone?
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; You can feel alone in a crowd.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; But the reality is you are not alone
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; because what he is,
[1:24:42] you are. Yes.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; That places him always on board.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Because what was in him is now in you.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; And union means one.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Union is not two people walking in
[1:25:02] agreement.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Union is becoming one.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Somebody say union is becoming one.
[1:25:11] This invisible union means that we are
[1:25:16] becoming one
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; with him.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; You doubt
[1:25:24] the word is clear
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; very clear. Thou sh there shall not any
[1:25:29] man be able to stand before thee all the
[1:25:32] days of thy life. As I was with Moses,
[1:25:35] so I will be with thee. I will not fail
[1:25:38] thee, nor
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; be strong.
[1:25:42] Be strong.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Quit ye like men. Be strong and of a
[1:25:48] good courage. I can't just do that. You
[1:25:50] can.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; You must. You have to.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; It's a commandment of the Lord.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "How do I do that?" You
[1:25:58] make up your mind.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you what the word said.
[1:26:02] Just telling you what the prophet said.
[1:26:04] I know that many of you believe you're
[1:26:05] the exception to both rules. But you are
[1:26:08] not.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; I wasn't. Those who went before me, they
[1:26:12] were not the exceptions to the rule. I
[1:26:15] can because he said I can. I will
[1:26:17] because he said I will.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; You speak that over your life.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; You make that confession over your life.
[1:26:23] I'm telling you, there's power.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; There's power in your confession.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; You may say it weak. You may not have
[1:26:33] the strength to say it loud. You may not
[1:26:35] even say it like you mean it. But if
[1:26:37] it'll come out of your mouth and it
[1:26:38] agrees with the truth of God's word, you
[1:26:41] have a high priest
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; and all he is there to do is to bear
[1:26:45] your confession.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; He just pushes your confession a little
[1:26:49] higher.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; So when you say, "I'm barely making it.
[1:26:54] I'm going under for the last time. I'm
[1:26:56] this, that, and the other." You are not
[1:26:59] confessing what is true. So don't be
[1:27:03] surprised if somebody just looks at you
[1:27:04] one day and said, "You're a liar."
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; What comes out of your mouth is a lie.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; That's how you feel. That's not what the
[1:27:12] word say.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Are you stirred this? I'm not upset, but
[1:27:16] I'm stirred. Yes, I am stirred because
[1:27:18] I've been with the Lord. I didn't have a
[1:27:20] choice but to be with the Lord this I
[1:27:22] had to make room for him in my life or I
[1:27:26] wouldn't have made it over. I don't
[1:27:27] remember one person asking me this week
[1:27:30] except my wife perhaps maybe one of my
[1:27:33] children could could have they do often
[1:27:36] but I don't remember anybody that I've
[1:27:38] ministered to much uh o over the past
[1:27:40] the last few weeks say pastor are you
[1:27:42] all right how are you getting along how
[1:27:44] do you feel what is your peace do you
[1:27:47] have peace do you walk in the victory or
[1:27:50] are you down and out do you feel a
[1:27:51] little hopeless but you know that's okay
[1:27:55] it's all right I'm not complaining
[1:27:57] that nobody asked me. I'm telling you,
[1:27:59] if I can make it
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; like that,
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; you can too.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; You can. You can. You can.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; You're called for this hour.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Be strong and of a good courage. For
[1:28:14] unto this people shalt thou divide for
[1:28:17] an inheritance the land. That you don't
[1:28:20] want to miss the reading of the will.
[1:28:23] You you you don't want to be absent on
[1:28:24] that day when they're dividing up the
[1:28:26] inheritance which I swear unto their
[1:28:29] fathers to give them. Only be thou here
[1:28:31] comes again.
[1:28:33] You if you didn't know better, you'd
[1:28:35] think Joshua was a big old coward. But
[1:28:37] that's not it at all. He was willing
[1:28:40] that we know. And that makes him
[1:28:42] courageous.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Willingness makes a man courageous, a
[1:28:47] woman courageous.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; But God knew how large the task was
[1:28:50] going to be. So he just kept putting
[1:28:52] into him, "Only be thou strong and very
[1:28:55] courageous, that thou mayest observe to
[1:28:58] do according to all the law which Moses
[1:29:00] my servant commanded thee. Turn not from
[1:29:03] it to the right hand or to the left,
[1:29:06] that thou mayest prosper."
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what side of the Jordan
[1:29:12] you're on,
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; You can prosper if you're not looking to
[1:29:17] the right hand or to the left. You've
[1:29:20] got Jesus in plain view.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; We must. Thou mayest prosper
[1:29:26] whethersoever thou goest. Lord, we need
[1:29:29] you today. We need you today.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Some are going to get blessed and some
[1:29:33] are going to get harassed and we're
[1:29:35] going to go home in Jesus name.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; I have determined in my heart to get
[1:29:40] blessed.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; I've determined that you're going to
[1:29:43] speak to me today
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; and I'm here to hear what you have to
[1:29:47] say. Uh, let the Holy Ghost order, let
[1:29:50] the divine government of the Lord arrest
[1:29:52] this service that we would not walk out
[1:29:55] of here without receiving what you have
[1:29:58] prepared and set aside for us in this
[1:30:01] hour.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; In the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[1:30:04] Christ, we pray. And the saints said,
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. I am bridging a
[1:30:10] gap.
[1:30:12] I am drawing a connection.
[1:30:15] I am giving you typology.
[1:30:19] I'm showing you that this little lad was
[1:30:23] a prophetic picture of a Joshua
[1:30:28] generation.
[1:30:30] He was a prophetic picture. What little
[1:30:33] lad? The little lad that was there to
[1:30:36] position Samson to the pillars of this
[1:30:39] great house of false worship and realry.
[1:30:45] Amen.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; In Judges
[1:30:47] 16 uh uh 26 and 27. And Samson said unto
[1:30:52] the lad that held him by the hand,
[1:30:54] suffer me that I may feel the pillars
[1:30:56] whereupon the house standeth, that I may
[1:30:59] lean upon them. He was once a man that
[1:31:02] didn't need anybody to show him where to
[1:31:04] go
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; or how to go or what to do when he got
[1:31:07] there. He was a man that seemed to have
[1:31:10] a a a godly intuition about the moment
[1:31:13] that God was going to break through and
[1:31:15] use him. And so even though he had a
[1:31:18] tendency to to wander
[1:31:21] into strange territory, it seems that he
[1:31:25] was always at the right place when God
[1:31:28] was getting ready to move.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; So Samson was intuitive by the spirit.
[1:31:33] Uh, it wasn't God who drove him down to
[1:31:36] the to the to the uh
[1:31:40] vineyard. It wasn't God who drove him
[1:31:42] this way or that way or the other way.
[1:31:45] It wasn't even God who put him in the
[1:31:46] lap of Delilah.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; No, sir. Didn't have to be that way.
[1:31:50] Somebody said, "Well, wasn't that his
[1:31:53] destiny to fall and to fail?" If it was,
[1:31:55] it was only for my benefit and your
[1:31:57] benefit because he was being mightily
[1:32:00] used of the Lord as long as he kept his
[1:32:02] eyes on the vow. When you leave your vow
[1:32:07] unguarded,
[1:32:09] when you leave your commitment, your
[1:32:11] covenant with God unguarded, unwatched,
[1:32:14] uncared for, you are walking in
[1:32:17] dangerous territory because then you
[1:32:19] become uh uh you can become a victim to
[1:32:22] every pull, to every sway, to every
[1:32:26] strange wind, to every contrary wind,
[1:32:29] and you may find yourself in a babble,
[1:32:32] in a confusion.
[1:32:33] like the very spirit of Babylon around
[1:32:35] us. So, we want to be repositioned. If
[1:32:39] we find ourselves at a at a wrong place
[1:32:43] or if we find ourselves blinded and
[1:32:46] unable to find direction, we want to ask
[1:32:49] that the Lord would reposition. I'm
[1:32:51] asking him. I know many will mock me. I
[1:32:54] know there will be those who watch this
[1:32:56] service who will mock me for even
[1:32:59] insinuating that the bride needs to be
[1:33:02] repositioned. But I am not insinuating
[1:33:05] it. I am declaring it in the name of the
[1:33:08] Lord. The bride needs to be repositioned
[1:33:12] in this hour.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; She has gotten away from her pillars.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; She is not earnestly content. I'm
[1:33:22] talking about as a whole, as a unit. She
[1:33:26] is no longer earnestly contending for
[1:33:29] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:33:32] saints.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; She's laboring and straining too hard to
[1:33:37] defend the reputation of brother
[1:33:39] Brandham.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; And I want you to know that if he were
[1:33:42] here today, he would tell you, "Don't
[1:33:44] worry about what they say about me. Get
[1:33:49] your eyes on Jesus.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; My old granny used to say, "I I don't
[1:33:56] care how dirty it gets today. It'll all
[1:33:58] come out on wash day.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; You let them say what they want to say.
[1:34:04] You let them rage like they want to rage
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; and do what they want to do." Well, I I
[1:34:10] was listening to something that happened
[1:34:12] this week. There's a great shaking
[1:34:15] that's taking place in the Pentecostal
[1:34:17] and charismatic world. Somebody said,
[1:34:20] "There you go. You shouldn't even be
[1:34:22] interested in that. Why shouldn't I?
[1:34:24] They're my brothers. I have sisters over
[1:34:26] there. I have brothers over there that
[1:34:29] God has not yet applied the Isaf that
[1:34:32] brought me out."
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; So, I'm praying for them.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; And God's been saying to them for years
[1:34:39] what he's been saying to his people for
[1:34:41] years. I'm going to shake everything
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; that can be shaken.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; There is a word and there is a people
[1:34:49] that cannot be shaken.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Because they're not worrying themselves
[1:34:55] on trying to defend the reputation of a
[1:34:58] prophet.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; We know that he was God's choice.
[1:35:04] I
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; I I want you to know uh I I can't I've
[1:35:08] gotten to a place where I I can hardly
[1:35:10] listen to our president talk.
[1:35:15] The very sound of his voice seems to to
[1:35:20] bring some agitation to me. But I know
[1:35:24] that for this job, for this hour, for
[1:35:27] this season, he has been God's choice.
[1:35:31] He makes me nervous. He talks way too
[1:35:34] much.
[1:35:36] They need to reduce his medication
[1:35:40] so that he can uh just calm himself just
[1:35:43] a little bit because I'm standing there
[1:35:46] uh trying you know if I listen I don't
[1:35:48] listen much anymore but when I do I'm
[1:35:50] there pray oh God oh God ask my wife oh
[1:35:53] God shut him up oh God help him Lord not
[1:35:57] to go on and on and on and on into
[1:35:59] something that's just going to make
[1:36:00] things worse just let him get behind
[1:36:03] that desk and do what he's supposed to
[1:36:05] do and sign what he's supposed to sign
[1:36:08] and quit trying to explain it. Uh,
[1:36:10] Brother Brandham got in trouble trying
[1:36:12] to explain everything.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; I've gotten in trouble trying to explain
[1:36:15] everything.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you understand what I'm saying?
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; But he was he's God's man.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; I want you to know I cannot explain
[1:36:23] everything about brother Brandham.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; I can't explain how that he said some
[1:36:28] things and and did them. I I I don't
[1:36:30] know why that was the way it was, but it
[1:36:33] was. But my eyes are not on him.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; And my faith is not anchored in him.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; If yours is, you've got more trouble
[1:36:43] coming.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; But my my focus and the anchor of my
[1:36:48] faith is what he said his was. It's in
[1:36:52] the absolute inherency of scripture.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; That word never fails. And while many of
[1:36:59] our brothers and sisters have made it to
[1:37:01] be one word, one word. It's just all one
[1:37:04] Bible and and tapes and books. I don't
[1:37:08] do that. I never have. It is not the
[1:37:10] revelation that I have. My I believe God
[1:37:14] has given us a great message of
[1:37:16] enlightenment and understanding. We
[1:37:19] needed it. But it cannot replace the
[1:37:22] absoluteness of the scripture. And
[1:37:24] neither can it be joined to it in such a
[1:37:27] way that it all becomes absolute.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Because as brother Joseph said
[1:37:33] yesterday, I totally disagree. I totally
[1:37:37] 100% disagree. I do not believe that
[1:37:40] everything on the tape is thus sayaith
[1:37:42] the Lord.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; I never believed it and I won't believe
[1:37:45] it now and I doubt very seriously I'll
[1:37:48] ever believe such an idea as that.
[1:37:50] That's not what he told us he came to
[1:37:53] do. It was to be a turning. It was to
[1:37:56] bring hearts. It was to connect
[1:37:59] generations.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; It was to turn hearts of fathers to
[1:38:04] children, children to fathers. Vice
[1:38:07] versy, which means connecting
[1:38:09] generations.
[1:38:11] Yeah.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; And so it's important for us to be able
[1:38:13] to see that
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; and spend our time uh uh in the word
[1:38:18] being strengthened by the truth
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; and not trying to figure out the things
[1:38:23] that we don't understand.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; I don't understand some of you watching
[1:38:28] that. I don't understand why brother
[1:38:30] Brandon preached the message he did on
[1:38:32] marriage and divorce and then performed
[1:38:35] wedding ceremonies for people that were
[1:38:37] double married. I don't understand why
[1:38:39] he did it for his own brother, but I'm
[1:38:41] not called to defend that.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; I'm called to stand on the word.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; I believe marriage and divorce was a
[1:38:49] revelation from the Lord.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; I believe the churches had so confus I'm
[1:38:53] coming to you in a minute. You say not
[1:38:55] even talking to us. I'm coming to you in
[1:38:57] a minute.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Uh I believe there was such a mess made
[1:39:00] in the denominations.
[1:39:03] Uh some said you just you know however
[1:39:05] many times just keep trying till you get
[1:39:07] it right and some said other things and
[1:39:10] some said when you come to the Lord you
[1:39:11] got to divorce and and separate and some
[1:39:15] I don't know what all they were saying
[1:39:16] but I believe the Lord came with an
[1:39:19] absolute
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; guess where it was based
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; it was there all the time
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Moses from the very beginning he said
[1:39:30] suffered you a bill of divorcement it,
[1:39:34] but it wasn't so.
[1:39:37] He permitted. He was permitted to do it,
[1:39:39] but it was not so. It was not in the
[1:39:41] mind of God to undo a vow that had been
[1:39:44] made. There it is. That's the answer.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; If you look at that, it will help you
[1:39:48] all the way through
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; to understand how these things ought to
[1:39:52] be handled. But there, I wasn't there
[1:39:54] and I don't know the details. And if God
[1:39:57] led brother Brandham to do something
[1:39:58] like that, uh it didn't it didn't shake
[1:40:01] my confidence
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; because I'm not here to defend. I'm not
[1:40:11] here to tear apart. But but I want you
[1:40:14] to know I was listening to one of these
[1:40:17] speakers this week while I was working
[1:40:20] and he was exposing some of this great
[1:40:23] scandal that's taking place in the
[1:40:27] charismatic movement
[1:40:29] where they're
[1:40:31] uh using Facebook
[1:40:34] to get information about people and then
[1:40:37] calling them out prophetically. No
[1:40:40] wonder they were saying no wonder they
[1:40:41] were saying that these people had
[1:40:44] similar uh uh you know giftings as
[1:40:46] brother Brandham because they saw them
[1:40:47] doing some of the same things they saw
[1:40:49] brother Brandham doing. And when they
[1:40:52] came to me with such an idea as that I
[1:40:53] said I don't believe it. I don't believe
[1:40:55] it. I don't believe it. I don't believe
[1:40:57] it. I spoke in a conference in Tucson
[1:41:00] where one of these men uh was was
[1:41:02] invited to speak and I was in that
[1:41:04] meeting and he we were told that he had
[1:41:07] the same kind of gifting. Now, we knew
[1:41:09] better, but
[1:41:11] he's got a word of knowledge. It's just
[1:41:13] like William Brandom. And we went I
[1:41:15] said, "I don't believe it, but I want to
[1:41:18] see it for myself." And and brother, did
[1:41:20] I see it for myself. We like not to pull
[1:41:23] the conference back together when he got
[1:41:25] through with his shenanigan. And now
[1:41:27] they have exposed some of these fellas
[1:41:29] from from studying on Facebook looking
[1:41:32] they're they're asking when they would
[1:41:34] go to a conference they were asking for
[1:41:35] the names of the spe of the participants
[1:41:38] in the conference. Why would they need
[1:41:40] that? Oh, I want to pray over these
[1:41:42] names. Well, if that's what you're
[1:41:44] doing, that'd be great. But instead,
[1:41:46] they were going on Facebook looking up
[1:41:47] these names, finding out details about
[1:41:50] their their dog's name.
[1:41:54] And you people that post what you had
[1:41:56] for supper last night, it wouldn't even
[1:41:58] take a prophet to tell you. I could just
[1:42:00] look you up and tell you what you ate
[1:42:02] cuz you've had to show me a picture of
[1:42:04] it.
[1:42:05] I've done it. I know what it what it
[1:42:07] what you're doing.
[1:42:09] But they but there comes some problems
[1:42:12] because some of the names they were
[1:42:13] calling. One little fella, he had a
[1:42:15] birthday dinner. It was his birthday and
[1:42:17] someone invited him to a birthday dinner
[1:42:19] and he missed that night of the
[1:42:20] conference and that was the night his
[1:42:21] name got called.
[1:42:27] These things have been going on for
[1:42:28] years.
[1:42:30] And would you believe that here is a a
[1:42:32] man who believes it's his job to uh to
[1:42:34] to speak all that out and to expose it
[1:42:37] and tell the whole world and and he just
[1:42:40] went right down the list. And if you
[1:42:41] didn't know any better, you'd think he
[1:42:43] didn't believe in the just because
[1:42:45] there's a thousand dozens and dozens and
[1:42:47] dozens of phonies and fakes and
[1:42:50] charlatans and janises and jambies and
[1:42:53] doesn't mean there hasn't been and can't
[1:42:55] be an a genuine.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is still genuine.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; But but I I I dealt with some of these
[1:43:04] very people that are being spoken about
[1:43:06] and I warned a few people about some of
[1:43:08] these things as we were going along with
[1:43:10] it. But what amazed me and the reason
[1:43:12] why I'm telling it is when they're
[1:43:14] listing the names of those who have been
[1:43:17] discredited right out there for the
[1:43:19] whole world to hear. They call the name
[1:43:21] William Brandom and they clump him in
[1:43:24] with the rest of them and it boils my
[1:43:27] blood.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. and I want to spit,
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; but I have to remind myself
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; that's not what you called me to do,
[1:43:39] Lord.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "I must decrease."
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; There was a man out there whose name was
[1:43:50] Chambers who was on the radio and
[1:43:52] writing articles and newspapers and
[1:43:54] things and sending them all around the
[1:43:55] world 20 plus years ago. and he came up
[1:43:58] with a story about brother Brandham and
[1:44:00] about the tunnels that were under his
[1:44:02] house in Jeffersonville that led out
[1:44:05] into the streets and how that he could
[1:44:07] uh go in and out through the through the
[1:44:10] uh through the uh what do you call it?
[1:44:12] uh the hole the the lid
[1:44:15] manhole cover and and he could go out
[1:44:19] and people didn't even know he'd come
[1:44:20] out of the house because he was going
[1:44:22] through the tunnels and and coming out
[1:44:24] and he was taking people in and all that
[1:44:28] kind of stuff. And I read that and you
[1:44:29] know I knew it didn't take some
[1:44:32] investigation.
[1:44:34] I knew it was just something that
[1:44:36] someone said I don't believe anybody
[1:44:38] would make that up. If you've ever been
[1:44:40] guilty of saying something like that,
[1:44:42] you're not living in 2026.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; For a long time now, people who want to
[1:44:48] malign and destroy, they don't have to
[1:44:50] tell the truth.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; They'll just make it up.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; And there are people who believe such a
[1:44:57] thing as that. And it was a lie. There
[1:44:59] were no tunnels. He wasn't sneaking in
[1:45:01] and out or sneaking anybody in or out.
[1:45:04] It was just something that somebody did
[1:45:06] to try to destroy. That is the hour that
[1:45:08] I would want to be very careful what I
[1:45:11] put my hand on.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; And I don't understand why in 2026 that
[1:45:16] they would have to lump him in with the
[1:45:18] modern charismatic and Pentecostal
[1:45:20] charlatans of our day. But they feel the
[1:45:23] need to do it. And there's a part of me
[1:45:26] that would love uh to defend and and uh
[1:45:30] make the the opposite statement and blah
[1:45:33] blah blah. But the but the reality is we
[1:45:37] don't have time to get caught up in
[1:45:40] those kinds of fights. We've got to get
[1:45:43] ready because we're on the horizon of
[1:45:46] the coming of the Lord.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; He has come to us in the fullness of his
[1:45:51] word and he's coming again to receive
[1:45:54] his bride unto himself. And that should
[1:45:57] be our focus in all that we do and all
[1:46:00] that we say in how we live our lives. We
[1:46:03] should be living a life of preparation.
[1:46:06] I am preparing for my real life. This is
[1:46:10] the dress rehearsal. This is only the
[1:46:13] dress rehearsal. My real life is just
[1:46:16] ahead. It's waiting on me.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; There is a generation that will arise
[1:46:24] that will not go around the mountain.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Not one more time. There is a people
[1:46:31] that will arise that will finally find
[1:46:34] their deliverance from Kadesh Barnea.
[1:46:36] They'll cross the Jordan. They will
[1:46:38] inherit the promises that are waiting on
[1:46:42] us on the other side. And we're not
[1:46:44] talking about heaven.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Heaven is the smallest portion of the
[1:46:51] bride's inheritance.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; It's that moment between now and then.
[1:46:56] It's that hour between now and eternity
[1:46:59] that God desires to unfold the purpose
[1:47:04] of the little lad of the Joshua
[1:47:07] generation
[1:47:08] of the last day remnant bride. Those who
[1:47:12] will step forward to guide anyone left
[1:47:16] in the church system or anyone from the
[1:47:20] from the message system
[1:47:23] who desires to be repositioned at the
[1:47:26] pillar at the foundation at the very
[1:47:29] absolute of scripture. If you think I'm
[1:47:32] off the word, the reality is I've got so
[1:47:35] much word for this that I don't even
[1:47:38] know how to outline it and give it out.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; This Bible is full of precious promises.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; And even though there will be those who
[1:47:48] will tell you they're all fulfilled,
[1:47:50] they are not all fulfilled.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; And I am determined if I live or if I
[1:47:55] die. I'm determined to see their reality
[1:47:58] and their fulfillment in my life. And if
[1:48:00] I don't live long enough to be the
[1:48:02] reality of that, I will be I will die
[1:48:05] preparing myself for what I know is
[1:48:08] ahead.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; And if I care about people like I say I
[1:48:12] do. And if I love people like I say I
[1:48:14] do, I will be as concerned about
[1:48:17] preparing the next generation
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; as I am building something for myself.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; You've got to make it. And your children
[1:48:29] have to make it.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; And they've got to know the Bible.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; They've got to know the Bible. And we
[1:48:35] not just know it.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; We've got to live by it.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; And we've got to think like it.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; And we've got to talk like it
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; because our words matter.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; So, I want to I want to make this type
[1:48:50] again. and and uh boy, I sure did use a
[1:48:53] lot of my time, but uh I I just did.
[1:48:57] It's done now. I can't take it back.
[1:48:59] Right. So, I I don't want to go back
[1:49:02] over everything about this little ad
[1:49:03] that we've already talked about, but I
[1:49:05] want to move on into something here. I
[1:49:08] want you to know that when the mighty
[1:49:10] fall,
[1:49:11] when when movements fall, when pre
[1:49:14] preachers fall, when when we get
[1:49:17] disappointed,
[1:49:19] when we lose our way,
[1:49:22] God always raises up. He's done it
[1:49:26] throughout all the church ages.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; He all He did it in the book of Acts.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; He always raises up a remnant.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:37] who will stay with the scripture.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; You've got to be part of that.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; You've got to understand solah
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; scripture only the Bible alone.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Meaning it is the complete authority.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; And every vision your pastor has, it has
[1:49:57] to line up with that Bible.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Or don't you even regard it. every
[1:50:02] dream,
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; everything Luther said,
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Luther said some terrible, awful,
[1:50:11] scandalous
[1:50:13] error.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; He said some horrible things. All the
[1:50:20] Jews be damned, he said. That's
[1:50:22] horrible.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; You might call him the father of
[1:50:26] anti-semitism.
[1:50:28] That's a hideous thing for him to say.
[1:50:30] He's partially responsible for the
[1:50:32] launching of the whole idea of
[1:50:35] replacement theology that the church had
[1:50:37] replaced the Jews. So I can tell you
[1:50:40] quickly that there's one of the church
[1:50:42] age messengers who was very flawed in
[1:50:45] part of his message.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; But he got one thing and maybe many
[1:50:51] others. But one thing I know that needed
[1:50:55] to be established to start cracking away
[1:50:59] at that system
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; that was taking the world. The just
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; shall live by priestly confessions.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Shall live by hail Marys.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Shall shall live by our fathers.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:51:17] indulgences or
[1:51:21] what do you call them? Rossaries.
[1:51:24] No, the just shall live by
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; faith.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; He's responsible for restoring the
[1:51:33] message of justification.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Trinitarian.
[1:51:37] He believed God was in three persons.
[1:51:41] He believed that when he got to heaven,
[1:51:42] he would meet the father and meet the
[1:51:45] son and meet the holy ghost.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; So did Wesley.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Wesley restored the the doctrine of
[1:51:55] sanctification.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; And he taught it and he taught it well.
[1:52:00] And he believed in the power of the
[1:52:03] washing of the water of the word. And he
[1:52:05] believed in a manifestation of a second
[1:52:07] installment of God's grace to a person
[1:52:10] to be set apart and strengthened to come
[1:52:12] away from the things of the world. God
[1:52:14] bless him. But he believed
[1:52:17] that when he got there, he was going to
[1:52:19] shake the father's hand and shake the
[1:52:20] son's hand and shake the Holy Ghost
[1:52:22] hand. My, you're going to be
[1:52:23] disappointed. Oh, you're going to be so
[1:52:25] disappointed.
[1:52:30] But God used him and he brought a truth
[1:52:33] that had been lost that needed to be
[1:52:35] restored. So what did God do? God in the
[1:52:38] last of the church ages, what has been
[1:52:41] called the Leodysian church age, it has
[1:52:43] also been called the Pentecostal church
[1:52:45] age. If you listen to the way they lay
[1:52:47] the church ages out in the in the modern
[1:52:49] message movement, you'll find them
[1:52:51] making eight ages instead of seven.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Because they will talk about the
[1:52:56] restoration of Pentecost as though it
[1:52:58] was its own age. No.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; No. That was Leodysia.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; That was Le Oysia.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; That's this age. You can't change the
[1:53:10] message halfway through the age.
[1:53:13] Therefore, this is still the Pentecostal
[1:53:15] age.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; It does doesn't belong to the
[1:53:19] organizations anymore.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; It belongs to whoever will find a real
[1:53:23] experience.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; It's available no matter where you go to
[1:53:26] church.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; It's available
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; if you'll just prepare to meet God.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; But then they they they had this uh
[1:53:33] restoration of Pentecost and then then
[1:53:36] they say, "Well, then we had this
[1:53:37] messenger who restored this that and the
[1:53:39] other." And certainly it's the truth. My
[1:53:41] point is this this message is either
[1:53:45] part of the seventh age or part of the
[1:53:47] millennium.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; And since I don't believe this is the
[1:53:50] millennium,
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; then God sent the last church age
[1:53:53] messenger in the last church age,
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; which was the age of Pentecost.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So for God to come toward the end
[1:54:01] of Leodysia and tell us that we no
[1:54:03] longer need these things
[1:54:06] would be a really wouldn't make any
[1:54:08] sense in light of all the other church
[1:54:10] ages.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Right? Amen.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; And so it's one age and now the focus
[1:54:19] and the emphasis must not be on gifts.
[1:54:23] We must make our focus the the whole
[1:54:25] word, the entire word. And we must not
[1:54:28] make our focus talking in tonesues.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Because while talking in tonesues,
[1:54:33] speaking in tonesues is an evidence
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost. It's not necessarily
[1:54:39] the initial evidence,
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; but it is an evidence.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; The Bible said so.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; The message tells us so, but not
[1:54:47] necessarily the initial. Meaning that if
[1:54:49] you don't talk in dong, you you you
[1:54:51] can't come to the assumption that the
[1:54:53] Holy Ghost hasn't come. If the Holy
[1:54:55] Ghost has come, he knows how. He can if
[1:54:58] you yield yourself. He can speak in
[1:54:59] heavenly languages through you or known
[1:55:02] languages also. He can. He might. He
[1:55:05] will. I hope he does.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Because you need it.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you'll obey the word,
[1:55:10] listen, I know people who speak in
[1:55:12] tongues
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; that I love and that I believe in them
[1:55:17] and have confidence in them, but I
[1:55:20] wouldn't dare go as far as to say
[1:55:24] because they spoke in tongues.
[1:55:28] Brother Brandham makes this mysterious
[1:55:30] statement. He he said, "You you can have
[1:55:32] the Holy Ghost. You could get the Holy
[1:55:34] Ghost every day for the rest of your
[1:55:36] life
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; and die and go to hell.
[1:55:41] Woo. Did you know he said it?
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; That's that's kind of rough, isn't it?
[1:55:47] But you come along and begin to
[1:55:48] understand. And you need to understand
[1:55:51] this because this is a part of the
[1:55:52] bride's favor. You didn't just get the
[1:55:55] Holy Ghost on your flesh.
[1:55:58] Amen.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; I don't make you jump and dance and run
[1:55:59] and holler and roll on the floor and run
[1:56:01] the pews and all these wonderful,
[1:56:03] glorious expressions of joy and praise.
[1:56:06] I love them all. Uh, as long as they're
[1:56:08] in order and as long as you're living
[1:56:09] right, I don't care how high you jump.
[1:56:11] But when you're feet touch the floor, I
[1:56:13] want you to be living right. That's what
[1:56:15] the word requires.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; But I like all that. But you can do that
[1:56:19] when all you've had is the spirit pour
[1:56:21] down on your flesh.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; You call that the Holy Ghost? Sure, it's
[1:56:26] the Holy Ghost. Sure it is.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; And you can get that middle ground. You
[1:56:32] can get a little touch of that Holy
[1:56:33] Ghost in that middle ground.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; But it's not until you've receive the
[1:56:37] full portion of the Holy Ghost on the
[1:56:40] inside of the inside that your spirit
[1:56:42] has finished its actual transformation
[1:56:46] of regeneration. And when that takes
[1:56:48] place, the Holy Ghost starts working
[1:56:50] itself back through that mind, will, and
[1:56:53] emotion
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; and to the flesh. And I don't care what
[1:56:57] order I get it. I just want to make sure
[1:56:59] that I've got the Holy Ghost in all of
[1:57:01] who I am. Oh, I want him on my flesh cuz
[1:57:05] I don't want to be a corpse.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; And I want him in my mind and my will
[1:57:08] and my emotion because I don't want to
[1:57:10] be tossed about with every wind of
[1:57:12] doctrine. But more than anything else, I
[1:57:15] want to know that he has changed my
[1:57:18] fallen inner man,
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; my spirit,
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; and he has endued me. Harai, endued me
[1:57:28] with his life.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; So, please understand that God's not
[1:57:34] finished.
[1:57:36] anything and everything that he is
[1:57:38] determined to do, he can do it in in a
[1:57:42] in in an amazingly short amount of time.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; What we have been preparing for for so
[1:57:50] many years could all be over in 30 days.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; In 40 days,
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't know. I'm not
[1:58:01] predicting. I'm not prophesying. I'm not
[1:58:04] putting an an amount of days on it. I'm
[1:58:07] just telling you that the reality is he
[1:58:11] could do it in 10 minutes.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; That's all. He's God.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, you'd be surprised how powerful he
[1:58:20] is when when we can cooperate with him
[1:58:23] instead of being in his way.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; How many of you want to cooperate with
[1:58:27] him?
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be in his way.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; I want to cooperate with him. So when
[1:58:33] when a when a mighty something God does
[1:58:36] mighty and it falls and and and and the
[1:58:40] the news reporter could stand back and
[1:58:42] say it's totally lost.
[1:58:48] I know in Israel some years ago there
[1:58:51] were some horrible forest fires. Are you
[1:58:54] looking this way? Good.
[1:58:56] Horrible forest fires.
[1:58:59] totally totally destroyed some of the
[1:59:02] national forest in Israel and and these
[1:59:05] these uh secular uh sabras are
[1:59:11] they're they're a lot of them are nearly
[1:59:12] tree huggers. They love
[1:59:15] the environment and they love uh trees
[1:59:18] and they love course I like trees
[1:59:21] myself. I didn't hadn't hugged one in a
[1:59:24] while but I really like them. I like
[1:59:25] plants. I like living things
[1:59:28] and um I like birds.
[1:59:32] And you ought to know that something was
[1:59:34] coming if you had a bird feeder this
[1:59:36] week because I'm telling you, we've been
[1:59:38] having to fill it uh about every other
[1:59:40] day because they are eating. I'm telling
[1:59:44] you, and calling their cousins
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; cuz they know something's coming and
[1:59:48] they're not going to be able to get
[1:59:49] food. So, they are fattening up.
[1:59:53] I'm I'm becoming my mother. I was
[1:59:56] standing at the window talking to them.
[2:00:01] That's how you know you're getting old
[2:00:02] when you talk to puppies and kitty cat.
[2:00:04] I don't talk to kitty cats, but I'll
[2:00:05] talk to puppy dogs and I talk to birds.
[2:00:08] And I said, "Look, little fella, you're
[2:00:10] fat enough. I think you've had your
[2:00:12] you're fool this week. You're filled.
[2:00:14] Now get out of the way, you little
[2:00:17] chickade." That's what he was. And let
[2:00:19] somebody else come and have some. They
[2:00:21] know something's going on.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; They know. They know that they they've
[2:00:25] got more uh uh seems like intelligence
[2:00:27] and than sometimes Christian people in
[2:00:30] knowing what's happening around us.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; I didn't know what was stirring. Had no
[2:00:33] idea really what was stirring in the
[2:00:35] atmosphere. But I knew when I pulled on
[2:00:37] the ground Tuesday evening, I knew
[2:00:39] something was stir disturbed in the
[2:00:41] atmosphere, but I wasn't sure exactly
[2:00:43] what it was. And a little later, they
[2:00:45] brought Elelliana in the office and she
[2:00:47] was just in a in a tither, they said.
[2:00:49] And I said, "Well, I wouldn't be I'm not
[2:00:51] trying to spiritualize everything and I
[2:00:53] wouldn't be putting anything on her, but
[2:00:54] I felt something in the atmosphere and I
[2:00:57] think there's something good in the
[2:00:58] atmosphere and something troubling in
[2:01:00] the atmosphere and she may be picking up
[2:01:02] on that." Did you know that we're made
[2:01:05] we're made and created in such a way
[2:01:07] that if we can be calm enough
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; and quiet enough,
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; we could even sense something of another
[2:01:14] dimension, something that's happening
[2:01:16] over there in another realm. Why would
[2:01:18] that be a good thing? It'd be a good
[2:01:20] thing because if it's something good,
[2:01:22] you want to pray it in.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; And if it's something bad, you want to
[2:01:25] be on guard
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; that it doesn't get a hold of you.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Because misery loves company. And
[2:01:32] confusion loves to divide and spread and
[2:01:35] multiply itself. Don't you be a part of
[2:01:37] it.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; It's too late now in the hour. So when
[2:01:40] the mighty fall, God always preserves
[2:01:42] and raises up a remnant. And so Samson
[2:01:45] had a calling. He had the supernatural.
[2:01:47] He had a vow which was perpetual. The
[2:01:49] history, he had the history. He he had
[2:01:52] experienced the raw power of God. He
[2:01:56] knew when the anointing had left because
[2:01:58] he shook himself and it was no longer
[2:02:00] there. So he was sensitive enough to
[2:02:02] that to that feeling of demonstration
[2:02:06] that he recognized that something had
[2:02:08] happened. But see, compromise had
[2:02:11] blinded him. It seemed that he was
[2:02:14] always yielding to the fleshpool.
[2:02:16] carnality had bound him and it will bind
[2:02:20] all of us
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; if we do not keep our eyes on Jesus.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Did you know there is sin
[2:02:30] and there is carnality
[2:02:33] and sometimes carnality
[2:02:35] can be sin
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; but sometimes carnality what we call
[2:02:41] carnality is just a manifestation of
[2:02:44] humanity.
[2:02:47] We're just people.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "I'm just a person."
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; And I act like people.
[2:02:54] And sometimes it's carnal because it's
[2:02:57] not spiritual.
[2:02:58] But it's really just people.
[2:03:01] People. And And notice sometimes those
[2:03:04] are the ones who make everything
[2:03:05] spiritual. No. Sometimes it's just
[2:03:08] people.
[2:03:10] And I I want you to know that if you
[2:03:13] have authority and someone's willing,
[2:03:15] you can cast a demon out of them or
[2:03:19] drive a demon off of them.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; But sometimes the problem is a soul
[2:03:25] issue.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; And that's one thing. You can pray and
[2:03:29] fast and cry and try to get the power to
[2:03:32] come along and help somebody, but you
[2:03:35] cannot fix or cast out or repair
[2:03:40] somebody else's soul.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; That's mind, will, and emotions.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; If I could, I would.
[2:03:56] I would have delivered a lot of people
[2:03:57] from their souls. I would have delivered
[2:04:00] myself from my soul many times. Now, for
[2:04:04] you uh who have it the other order, just
[2:04:08] pretend like I'm saying spirit because
[2:04:11] I'm talking about the middle ground.
[2:04:13] Whatever you call the middle ground that
[2:04:15] sometime, not sometime, all the time,
[2:04:18] once you become a Christian, that's
[2:04:19] where your trouble is.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, I thought it was on
[2:04:23] my flesh." Well, the reality is your
[2:04:25] flesh is just going to obey your outer
[2:04:27] man. And the desires of the flesh,
[2:04:29] they're just going to follow in the
[2:04:30] leadership of the inner man.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; So if there's a war going on between
[2:04:34] your regenerated spirit and your soul,
[2:04:39] your flesh is going to feel the war.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody say you got scripture for
[2:04:44] that. Believe I do. The apostle said,
[2:04:46] "Oh wretched man that I am, who will
[2:04:50] deliver me? For in my innermost being,
[2:04:54] there is a warfare. And when I seek to
[2:04:56] do good, evil shows up.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; And the good that I would do, and on and
[2:05:04] on and on. And the reality of it is he
[2:05:07] was experiencing that inner war that you
[2:05:11] and I experience. I I don't think I'd be
[2:05:14] exaggerating to say on a daily basis
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; something in there wants to war against
[2:05:20] the will of God
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; in my life.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; I I think I mean I'm maybe not aware of
[2:05:27] it every day, but I think it would be
[2:05:28] safe to say that is poss. It's possible
[2:05:31] that you would have that warfare going
[2:05:33] on every day. Well, how do you how do
[2:05:35] you win? You win by by keep holding on.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Cade told us how to win. Keep holding on
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; and he'll keep holding on to you and
[2:05:45] feed the inner part, the middle, the I
[2:05:48] mean, excuse me, the inside of the
[2:05:49] inside. Feed that.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; I was reading a quotation from a sermon
[2:05:54] that I had preached here some years ago
[2:05:56] because I was looking for something and
[2:05:59] I happened to be talking about feeding
[2:06:01] that inner man and and and I and I said
[2:06:04] something like this
[2:06:06] there. It it receives no sustenance. It
[2:06:09] receives no nourishment from true
[2:06:13] romance
[2:06:15] novel.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; It receives no nourishment from your
[2:06:19] daily horoscope.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; It receives no nourishment from your
[2:06:24] favorite video game.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; It receives no nourishment from your
[2:06:29] favorite social media outlet. Right.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; There's only one thing that feeds the
[2:06:34] inside of the inside,
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; and that is the unadulterated
[2:06:38] word of God.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; And whatever part of you you feed the
[2:06:46] most,
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; it's going to lead. And you know that's
[2:06:52] a truth.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; If you're here, say amen.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to trick you. You weren't
[2:06:57] saying amen to what I said particularly.
[2:06:59] I said, "If you're here, say amen." Then
[2:07:01] everybody can participate.
[2:07:03] Carnality bound him. It will all of us
[2:07:05] if we don't keep our eyes on Jesus.
[2:07:07] Comfort shaved off the secret. He was
[2:07:10] looking to be soothed. Samson wanted to
[2:07:14] be soothed.
[2:07:16] So he found a beautiful woman, laid his
[2:07:19] head in her lap, and let her stroke his
[2:07:22] hair and massage his temples.
[2:07:26] He wanted to be petted.
[2:07:30] Oh, just a minute. Let me have a little
[2:07:31] water here. He wanted to be petted,
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; rubbed on, not sexual.
[2:07:38] Not talking about that. That was another
[2:07:41] big part of his problem, lust.
[2:07:45] But that only manifested
[2:07:48] because he had this need to be petted,
[2:07:53] to be soothed.
[2:07:56] Now, you would like to say that every
[2:07:57] man has that and it's part of everyday
[2:08:00] natural life. Well, I want to tell you
[2:08:02] that that is true by design. However,
[2:08:06] you're going to have to sanctify that
[2:08:08] part of who you are
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; or it'll put your head in the wrong lap
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; and you'll find your soothing in some
[2:08:17] other thing or some other person.
[2:08:23] or or you'll find your crutch to be
[2:08:26] something else and your fix to be
[2:08:29] something else. So that has to be
[2:08:30] subdued. But you wouldn't think that
[2:08:32] mighty giant, that superhero of the
[2:08:34] faith needed to just be, "Oh, now now
[2:08:39] darling, now now
[2:08:44] you big brute.
[2:08:47] Everything is all right."
[2:08:52] I hear preachers doing it
[2:08:55] all the time.
[2:08:59] They call it preaching the message.
[2:09:02] What I find they're doing many times,
[2:09:05] God, help me not to feel this need
[2:09:11] to stroke
[2:09:13] and soothe what needs to be tamed. And
[2:09:18] only the Holy Ghost can tame,
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; only the Holy Ghost can cause you to
[2:09:24] feel like you are not alone when you
[2:09:27] feel alone. Only the Holy Ghost can
[2:09:29] rewire and remake us. And
[2:09:33] he's the only one, him in us is the only
[2:09:36] one that can do that. But I hear
[2:09:38] preachers finding the need to excuse the
[2:09:40] sin in their congregation and the
[2:09:43] compromise in their congregation. And in
[2:09:45] doing so, they're just stroking the
[2:09:47] people like, "Now, now, now, this is
[2:09:51] Satan's Eden. Oh, bless your heart. You
[2:09:55] had to live in the last age. Oh, it's
[2:09:58] harder now." I hear people saying the
[2:10:01] the temptation. Some of you believe
[2:10:03] this. And I want you to know you're dead
[2:10:05] wrong. I'm telling you boldly, you're
[2:10:08] dead wrong.
[2:10:10] But they say things like, you know, the
[2:10:12] young people of this generation, they
[2:10:13] they have to go through so much
[2:10:17] that other generation didn't have to go
[2:10:19] through.
[2:10:22] No, the devices are different. The
[2:10:25] avenues are different. They no longer
[2:10:27] have to go to 7-Eleven to get the
[2:10:28] Playboy.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; But they are fighting. Whether you like
[2:10:34] it or not, young generation, I'm going
[2:10:36] to preach you into a Joshua group.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; I am.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you before you get
[2:10:42] there that you're going to have to quit
[2:10:43] feeling sorry for yourself.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; As though you're the only generation
[2:10:46] that ever struggled to serve and
[2:10:49] struggle to overcome.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; My generation and the one before me and
[2:10:53] the one before me and the one Well, are
[2:10:55] you but but don't you understand that
[2:10:57] life was more simple? Sure. But it's the
[2:11:00] same devil. It's the same devil. It's
[2:11:03] the same fallen nature. It's the same
[2:11:07] temptation.
[2:11:09] It's the same pull. Yes, we're more
[2:11:12] bombarded.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, it's on every billboard. It's on
[2:11:18] every radio station, on every television
[2:11:21] station.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; It's in our faces more.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; But the reality is the pull is the same.
[2:11:30] That's right.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; The same root.
[2:11:33] And where would you be? I don't want to
[2:11:35] shame anybody, but where would you be if
[2:11:38] we had fallen in disgrace and laid in
[2:11:42] the ditch?
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; Where would this generation be
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; if all of those who went before them had
[2:11:49] give up?
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Where would you be if the old prayer
[2:11:55] warrior hadn't stayed on her prayer
[2:11:57] knees? And where would you be if there
[2:12:01] wasn't somebody in your face constantly
[2:12:03] preaching to you the truth?
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; So we've had a generation before us in
[2:12:09] which many failed
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; and many have lost their way. But let us
[2:12:14] not forget
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; that there have been those who have
[2:12:18] overcome.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; How daily
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; I don't consider myself as someone who
[2:12:25] has and never will have to again. I have
[2:12:29] to overcome like you do every day.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Whether you ask me how I feel or not.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; You see,
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; I'm saying that not for you to ask me
[2:12:40] cuz frankly wouldn't mean a thing.
[2:12:45] I'm saying it so that you will
[2:12:47] understand
[2:12:49] that you can you don't everybody don't
[2:12:52] have to know.
[2:12:58] And some of you are, of course, you're
[2:13:00] you're kind of built so that you don't
[2:13:02] want anybody to know. Well, we're not
[2:13:04] blind either. You know what I'm saying?
[2:13:07] But there are some folks they just have
[2:13:08] to tell everybody that they're on the
[2:13:11] last Oh, God. Oh,
[2:13:16] no. I just can't make it. No, just a
[2:13:23] I know names are flying in your head
[2:13:25] like mine.
[2:13:27] Pray for me that I don't call them.
[2:13:34] We're dramatic.
[2:13:37] And sitting right beside us or right in
[2:13:40] front of us is somebody fighting the
[2:13:42] same or worse and hadn't told a soul.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; But they showed up.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Maybe they got bags under their eyes.
[2:13:55] Maybe they've wrestled all night,
[2:13:58] but they showed up
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; because that's what God's people do.
[2:14:03] In every generation, there has to be a
[2:14:06] remnant of people that no matter what
[2:14:08] the church does, I mean, look folks,
[2:14:09] it's kind of dis I'll be honest, it's
[2:14:11] kind of disappointing to me because they
[2:14:13] preached to me a third exodus and I
[2:14:15] thought that was it.
[2:14:18] Nobody dared tell me I was facing
[2:14:20] another one. Brother Brandham only got
[2:14:23] to three.
[2:14:26] So they told me that once I came out of
[2:14:28] denomination and into this message, they
[2:14:31] sold it in such a way that I thought,
[2:14:33] well then the battle's just about over
[2:14:34] now and we won't never have to separate
[2:14:36] ourselves again.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; But what we find out now is that because
[2:14:42] carnality is prevailing
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; and because people are feeling such a
[2:14:46] need to spend their time vindicating the
[2:14:48] signs,
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; singing about the signs,
[2:14:57] and defending the servant, the prophet,
[2:15:00] that we have had the need to be
[2:15:03] separated again.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; And so what they sling at us as insults
[2:15:09] and sometimes what my children have felt
[2:15:12] as insults when they would go to the
[2:15:15] youth camps and be treated the way they
[2:15:17] have been treated.
[2:15:20] Really, it's not an insult at all
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; when you tell us that we're not a part
[2:15:25] of that system that you all have created
[2:15:28] around the truth. You're really, really
[2:15:31] egging me on. You're really bringing
[2:15:34] strength to my going
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; because I didn't know it, but I had to
[2:15:38] come out again
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; because I chose. I determined. I am
[2:15:42] determined. I don't mean to boast. I
[2:15:44] want you to be with me. We got to do
[2:15:46] this together. But we are determined to
[2:15:49] stay on the word.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; And we won't know that we've arrived
[2:15:53] until we can live it.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; Until we can do it.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; Until we can tell the truth.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; And live the truth.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Lord,
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; and manifest this seed.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Tell me what kind of gene is in you.
[2:16:11] Manifest it. Show me what life is in
[2:16:14] there. Show me what you came here with.
[2:16:17] Show me what he deposited in you.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; No. Tell me you've got the Holy Ghost.
[2:16:22] Show me you've got the Holy Ghost.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:26] Not because you were soothed.
[2:16:30] Not because you laid your head in
[2:16:32] Delilah's lap and she rubbed your brow,
[2:16:35] but because you made up your mind. I'm
[2:16:37] going on with Jesus.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; Do you know what the alternative is?
[2:16:45] We talk like it's a vacation.
[2:16:49] It's not a holiday.
[2:16:52] You turn loose of him,
[2:16:54] you're in trouble,
[2:16:58] sir.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; Of course, you've seen the track record
[2:17:01] that he's going to hold on to you. But
[2:17:02] I'll tell you that doesn't mean that
[2:17:04] it's not going to get mighty
[2:17:07] hard.
[2:17:10] Brother Gley, I don't know how many I've
[2:17:12] had through the years come to me and say
[2:17:14] you you preached me back to faith,
[2:17:18] but you didn't tell me how hard it was
[2:17:20] going to be to go back to where I was.
[2:17:24] You told me the Lord would accept me. He
[2:17:26] would receive me. He would bring me in
[2:17:28] the fold. He would marry to the
[2:17:30] backslider. He would find me. He But you
[2:17:32] didn't tell me how hard it was going to
[2:17:34] be when I made up my mind.
[2:17:39] because it's like starting over.
[2:17:45] But oh, it's worth it.
[2:17:52] If you'll just make him everything, my
[2:17:55] everything, it's worth it.
[2:17:58] 117
[2:18:00] carnality.
[2:18:02] Listen,
[2:18:04] Samson took his present and future for
[2:18:06] granted. And this is where we are.
[2:18:09] We are doing the same thing.
[2:18:12] Samson took his present and his future
[2:18:14] for granted because he knew what had
[2:18:16] happened in the past. I'm going to read
[2:18:17] it again. Make sure you heard me.
[2:18:20] He took his present and his future for
[2:18:22] granted because he knew what had
[2:18:25] happened in the past.
[2:18:28] And we've done the same thing many
[2:18:30] times. We know how God has helped us in
[2:18:32] the past. So, we just take for granted
[2:18:35] that it's just a free thing and we don't
[2:18:37] have to uh we don't have to pray more
[2:18:39] and we don't have to push in. But I want
[2:18:41] you to know it stripped him of
[2:18:44] everything he had known.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; And his yielding to the distractions
[2:18:48] reduced him to the grinding stone.
[2:18:51] But to rescue him, I said this, God did
[2:18:54] not send a committee, a council, or a
[2:18:56] system. He sent a kid.
[2:18:59] He sent a lad. Not a priest, not a
[2:19:02] warrior, not an elder, not a judge, but
[2:19:04] a young lad. Samson is definitely a type
[2:19:07] of the modern church. I've read you what
[2:19:09] the prophet has said many, many times,
[2:19:11] and I want you to listen to this. That
[2:19:14] that church, that Pentecostal church,
[2:19:16] that original church,
[2:19:19] both born on the day of Pentecost and
[2:19:23] revived at Isusa Street.
[2:19:26] She once slew lions
[2:19:30] and at other times shut the mouth of
[2:19:32] lions. She once carried gates. Do you
[2:19:36] know what that's a type of? It means
[2:19:39] government.
[2:19:41] Government is in the gate.
[2:19:44] Justice and judgment is determined at
[2:19:48] the gate.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; That's why we need holy
[2:19:52] sanctified gatekeepers.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because justice and judgment is
[2:20:00] rendered in the gate. The elders of the
[2:20:02] city would sit at the gate.
[2:20:07] Not the ancient gate that Abraham walked
[2:20:10] through,
[2:20:11] but the other gate to the city of Dan
[2:20:16] has also been uncovered. And it's one of
[2:20:20] the places where you can climb the hill
[2:20:24] up the cobblestone and walk through the
[2:20:26] gate. You can't walk through the gate
[2:20:29] that Abraham walked through because it's
[2:20:31] preserved for you to see it. But you can
[2:20:34] walk through the gate that followed that
[2:20:36] gate some hundreds of years later. Still
[2:20:39] ancient. And you can see the seat, the
[2:20:42] seats, the stones, the places where the
[2:20:46] elders would sit. And there would be
[2:20:48] one, it's not there, but there would be
[2:20:51] one seat that was called a beimma, and
[2:20:55] it was a judgment seat. And when a
[2:20:58] decision was being rendered over any
[2:21:00] matter that concerned the city, the
[2:21:04] town, the community, or individuals in
[2:21:06] the community, one of the elders would
[2:21:08] sit on that seat, and he would read the
[2:21:11] determined decree
[2:21:14] of the elders.
[2:21:17] And it would either be justice
[2:21:20] with restitution
[2:21:23] or it would be judgment with penalty.
[2:21:27] It was not decided by presidents,
[2:21:30] not even kings.
[2:21:33] In cities,
[2:21:34] it was determined by elders
[2:21:37] sitting at the gate. The very fact that
[2:21:39] Samson carried the gates away of a city
[2:21:44] speaks of course it was a a pagan city.
[2:21:48] It was a city of the Philistines. Yes.
[2:21:50] But it speaks to us of the church's
[2:21:52] authority
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; to stand in the gate
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; in intercession and in prayer and in
[2:22:01] prophetic decree and determine things
[2:22:06] that we have no earthly authority over.
[2:22:10] Our authority comes from heaven.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; Our authority comes from the word. The
[2:22:16] mayor doesn't call us and the governor
[2:22:18] doesn't call us and the city council
[2:22:20] doesn't call us. But heaven is waiting
[2:22:24] on a generation who will take serious
[2:22:28] the responsibility to make sure the gate
[2:22:31] is occupied.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; It was the elders. It was the elders.
[2:22:40] You know why? Because the youth were
[2:22:42] distracted.
[2:22:47] They were on the video game. They were
[2:22:48] on the disc golf. They were on this,
[2:22:51] that, the other. I'm not saying that any
[2:22:53] of the on the phone. I'm not saying any
[2:22:56] of these things are sin.
[2:23:00] Sometimes I'm jealous
[2:23:02] that I don't have anything other than a
[2:23:05] a few plants to fool with. when I am
[2:23:10] in need of
[2:23:13] of course I wouldn't I wouldn't play
[2:23:14] with some of you if I was stressed
[2:23:16] anyway
[2:23:22] I love you all
[2:23:24] come go play golf with us are you
[2:23:26] kidding
[2:23:30] I know how that works
[2:23:34] like when people sit down beside can I
[2:23:35] sit here and eat I won't bother you.
[2:23:38] I won't ask any question. I won't say
[2:23:42] it never never goes that way, right? So,
[2:23:45] if I need any any kind of I shut my door
[2:23:49] and I either pray, which is most of the
[2:23:51] time, or I fool with a little plant or
[2:23:55] something.
[2:23:57] I I enjoy it. So, I'm not against hobby.
[2:24:01] I'm not against a pastime. My some of my
[2:24:04] family likes to play board games.
[2:24:05] They're not none of them fanatics about
[2:24:08] it because they'll go for weeks and
[2:24:10] weeks and weeks and weeks and and not so
[2:24:14] but any of these things I I I like
[2:24:16] sometime to see some documentary or
[2:24:19] something I I like or I'm interested in.
[2:24:22] I enjoyed The Chosen. I know a lot of
[2:24:24] people found every every mistake in it
[2:24:27] and and and I could have too, but I
[2:24:29] found rather found the things that
[2:24:31] encouraged me and inspired me and and
[2:24:34] helped me and explained a thing or two
[2:24:36] for me even and loved it. So, I'm not
[2:24:39] against I'm not against you don't have
[2:24:42] to be religious all the time. I'm not
[2:24:45] talking about that. But I'm talking
[2:24:47] about the fact that it had to be the
[2:24:49] elders because they had sort of lived
[2:24:51] their life and had their fun and now
[2:24:53] they were taking their old age serious
[2:24:56] and and they sat there every day because
[2:24:57] they knew somebody wasn't going to get
[2:24:59] along with somebody and somebody's cow
[2:25:01] was going to meander over into somebody
[2:25:04] else's field and somebody was going to
[2:25:05] have to set this thing straight and
[2:25:07] somebody was going to have to decide
[2:25:09] what would be the recompense and what
[2:25:11] would be the restitution and how it' all
[2:25:14] be solved. None of that sounds
[2:25:15] interesting to me in the natural.
[2:25:18] I don't do well settling uh earthly
[2:25:20] disputes. I don't I don't feel like I
[2:25:23] have the wisdom to make my own decision
[2:25:26] if the Lord doesn't help me. So, I
[2:25:28] certainly don't think I have the wisdom
[2:25:30] to fix everybody else's situation.
[2:25:32] But I have an addiction.
[2:25:36] And that addiction is I love when he
[2:25:39] gives me an assignment
[2:25:42] at the gate
[2:25:44] when he said, "This is what I want you
[2:25:46] to pray over, and this is what I want
[2:25:48] you to declare, and this is what I want
[2:25:51] you to prophesy, and this is the
[2:25:53] scripture I want you to read out loud.
[2:25:55] And you may not see the results. You may
[2:25:57] not hear of the results, but if you'll
[2:26:00] be obedient to me,
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; yes,
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; I will increase the jurisdiction of your
[2:26:05] authority.
[2:26:06] and I'll come back to you again
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; with another assignment.
[2:26:11] We're coming to the end of this thing
[2:26:14] and there's going to have to be a Joshua
[2:26:16] generation raising up now
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; and there going to have to be some
[2:26:21] younger judges at the gate. There's
[2:26:23] going to have to be some younger
[2:26:25] spiritual authorities at the gate
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; because we're coming to the end of this
[2:26:30] thing and we're not going to be able to
[2:26:32] wait until you're 50, 60, 70, 80 years
[2:26:35] old. You're going to have to ask the
[2:26:37] Lord if you if you care at all. If you
[2:26:38] care at all about the Lord's business,
[2:26:41] if you care at all about the Lord's
[2:26:43] work,
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; you're going to have to make yourself
[2:26:46] available.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; And in order to do that, you're going to
[2:26:48] have to pull away
[2:26:50] from some of the other things.
[2:26:53] &gt;&gt; And you're going to have to somehow
[2:26:55] overcome the need for somebody to stroke
[2:26:58] your hair
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; and tell you that it's going to be all
[2:27:04] right. It's going to be all right
[2:27:06] whether your pastor tells you so or not.
[2:27:08] It's going to be all right whether your
[2:27:10] mommy tells you so or not. It's going to
[2:27:12] be all right whether your husband tells
[2:27:14] you so or not. It's going to be all
[2:27:16] right because God's word said
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; you're going to make it.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; I believe that today
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; without hearing a song, without hearing
[2:27:30] a sermon. I believe that today. But now
[2:27:32] Jason, tomorrow
[2:27:34] I may come to work singing I'm going to
[2:27:38] make it.
[2:27:40] You already said I would because I woke
[2:27:45] up
[2:27:49] not so sure
[2:27:54] just like you.
[2:27:57] But I sing my way there or I pray my way
[2:28:00] there or I read the word to get me there
[2:28:03] or I hear the message to get me there
[2:28:07] and by the time I the day is done I may
[2:28:09] be beat or whipped or whatever. You
[2:28:11] never know what you're going to go
[2:28:12] through in the course of a day and there
[2:28:15] are times that I believe it all day long
[2:28:18] and I head home and before I get home I
[2:28:21] feel the same kind of things you do. The
[2:28:23] squeeze is coming on the emotion. You're
[2:28:26] feeling this. You're thinking of that.
[2:28:27] All this stuff comes piling on again.
[2:28:29] And you know what I have to do sometime
[2:28:31] going home? Turn off the radio. Turn off
[2:28:33] the preaching. Turn off the music.
[2:28:38] And I just hum.
[2:28:45] He's already said I would.
[2:28:50] On occasion, I text Brother Gley, I
[2:28:53] could use some extra prayer. It's it's
[2:28:55] rare,
[2:28:56] but I do when I feel like I really need
[2:28:59] to.
[2:29:02] Rare have I ever made a post or because
[2:29:05] I know how hard it is when you're there
[2:29:09] to think your leader is there.
[2:29:14] And I made up my mind. I'm not I'm not a
[2:29:17] hero. I'm a I'm a rotten man. I'm not
[2:29:20] trying to boast.
[2:29:23] I'm telling you what I have to tell
[2:29:25] myself.
[2:29:27] This weight of this hour shouldn't just
[2:29:31] be on a handful of people's shoulders.
[2:29:34] It's got to be on a generation.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; And we used to say the the generals, the
[2:29:41] older ones, but now we have to say that
[2:29:44] we're coming to Moses is dead,
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; but I'll be with you.
[2:29:54] Just like I was with him
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; and I'll help you make it through
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; if you'll hold on to me.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; Anybody believe it?
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; All right. It's 129. I'm hurrying.
[2:30:07] She once slew lions. She once carried
[2:30:10] gates, which means her prayers, the
[2:30:12] prayers of the Pentecostal church,
[2:30:14] shifted governments,
[2:30:17] changed nations.
[2:30:19] There's no authority
[2:30:22] in all of the heavenly realm that moves
[2:30:27] the supernatural hand of God like bridal
[2:30:31] intercession,
[2:30:32] like the cry of sons.
[2:30:36] And bridal intercession
[2:30:38] is different because it comes out of a
[2:30:41] place of intimacy and relationship.
[2:30:46] It's not begging
[2:30:48] your father or pleading with your
[2:30:52] husband.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; It's understanding that you're his wife
[2:30:59] because he wanted you.
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; I don't know why, but he did. And here
[2:31:07] we are.
[2:31:09] And so I don't have to beg him.
[2:31:12] He wants to help us.
[2:31:15] He wants to help this church.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; He wants to help our young people. He
[2:31:19] wants to help this little bride.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; He wants to help reposition us all back
[2:31:24] to what once made us strong.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; You take the supernatural out of this
[2:31:31] message. You don't have much left.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; Then it's just doctrine.
[2:31:36] But you take the supernatural and you
[2:31:38] take the truth that was revealed and the
[2:31:40] doctrine that was made plain and you've
[2:31:42] got everything you need to whip the
[2:31:44] devil every day of your life, 24 hours a
[2:31:48] day if that's what it takes, 365 days of
[2:31:51] the year. This Pentecostal church that
[2:31:54] we so quickly criticize and condemn
[2:31:56] because we've seen how the mighty have
[2:31:58] fallen and we forget that God has kept
[2:32:00] and preserved a remnant of which I'm a
[2:32:02] part and which many of you are a part
[2:32:04] of.
[2:32:05] and and we think it's all in vain. It
[2:32:07] wasn't in vain. What God did in
[2:32:10] Pentecost was real
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; and it wasn't until men tried to keep
[2:32:15] propping it up
[2:32:17] instead of doing it God's way
[2:32:20] &gt;&gt; that it began to get corrupt.
[2:32:22] She once shook nations. This Pentecostal
[2:32:24] experience swept the globe one
[2:32:26] generation ago. I want you to watch
[2:32:29] this. Approximately 644
[2:32:32] million people. 644 million people
[2:32:36] worldwide consider themselves to be part
[2:32:39] of a Pentecostal or charismatic
[2:32:40] movement.
[2:32:42] 644 million.
[2:32:47] That accounts for about 8% of the global
[2:32:50] population.
[2:32:53] 8% of the people on the planet claim to
[2:32:56] have had a Pentecostal experience. And
[2:32:58] you tell me it's dead and over and these
[2:33:00] children don't count and this generation
[2:33:03] doesn't matter and it all ended in 77
[2:33:07] and their souls don't matter. Sure they
[2:33:09] matter. Sure they matter. That's why
[2:33:12] that that harvest will have to come when
[2:33:16] the bride steps forward to do his work.
[2:33:20] Quick, short, but powerful. Are you
[2:33:24] still with me?
[2:33:25] Nearly 26%
[2:33:27] nearly 26% of all Christians consider
[2:33:30] themselves to be Pentecostal. This
[2:33:32] includes denominational Pentecostals
[2:33:34] like neo Pentecostal, classic
[2:33:36] Pentecostals, charismatics
[2:33:38] and independent movements and is
[2:33:41] expanding rapidly.
[2:33:43] Out of the 644 million people who claim
[2:33:46] to have had a Pentecostal experience, 92
[2:33:48] million of them are classic
[2:33:50] Pentecostals. That's Assemblies of God,
[2:33:51] Church of God, uh, and others. United
[2:33:54] Pentecostal, 234 million charismatics.
[2:34:00] That's over double classic Pentecostals.
[2:34:03] And you sure can tell it by the confused
[2:34:04] mess their church is in today.
[2:34:08] We needed some We needed some uh oldtime
[2:34:13] Holy Ghost preaching, singing, shouting,
[2:34:16] praying, Bible thumping.
[2:34:20] That's what we needed. Instead of so
[2:34:23] much weirdness,
[2:34:26] instead of somebody's zipper vibrating
[2:34:28] and you're trying to interpret it, will
[2:34:30] you please interpret? Will you please
[2:34:32] tell me what it means? I think my I feel
[2:34:34] my zipper vibrating
[2:34:37] as though God is trying to send you a
[2:34:39] message through your zipper.
[2:34:41] Can you imagine such a thing?
[2:34:44] I'll give you the interpretation of
[2:34:46] that. The bass is too loud. That's why
[2:34:48] your zipper's vibrating.
[2:34:51] God ain't saying anything except turn
[2:34:53] down the base.
[2:34:57] But that's what they talk.
[2:35:01] Or they want to hand you an indivi an
[2:35:03] invisible sword.
[2:35:05] I don't need one I can't see.
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; I need one I can see. Cuz I'm already
[2:35:10] fighting an invisible enemy.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; So I need a weapon I can get a hold of.
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; And I got it. If you've got the word,
[2:35:18] you've got the sword.
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; If you've got the revelation of the
[2:35:21] word, you've got the sword.
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:35:25] &gt;&gt; And so there's 234 million charismatics
[2:35:28] within traditional denominations and 259
[2:35:31] million
[2:35:33] within independent churches. So some
[2:35:36] estimates suggest that if those who have
[2:35:38] had the Pentecostal experience but
[2:35:40] remained in their mainline churches and
[2:35:42] if the broader definitions of the
[2:35:44] charismatic movement were considered the
[2:35:46] number would be 1 billion.
[2:35:50] Could be as many as 1 billion people
[2:35:52] alive on the planet right now who claim
[2:35:55] to have had an encounter with the Holy
[2:35:56] Ghost. And the highest concentrations of
[2:35:59] those are in Africa.
[2:36:02] 230 million Africans claim to have had a
[2:36:06] Holy Ghost encounter.
[2:36:08] 195 million in Latin America.
[2:36:15] Maybe it's cuz they know how to praise.
[2:36:18] Listen, don't you feel sorry for poor
[2:36:21] little Asia?
[2:36:23] I know there's a lot of folks there that
[2:36:25] hadn't been reached yet, but already 125
[2:36:29] million in Asia.
[2:36:32] And then there's North America,
[2:36:35] 68 million.
[2:36:39] So the power that God poured out at
[2:36:41] Isusa Street, the same power that he
[2:36:44] poured out on the day of Pentecost has
[2:36:47] had far more effect in other nations
[2:36:52] &gt;&gt; than this nation.
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; And I know the answer to that. I know
[2:36:56] why it's been because she turned down
[2:37:00] the word.
[2:37:03] &gt;&gt; She wanted the feeling. She wanted the
[2:37:06] sensation. She wanted the experience,
[2:37:09] but she didn't want the word.
[2:37:11] &gt;&gt; She didn't want the standard.
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; She didn't want Jesus name baptism.
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; That put her on the other side of the
[2:37:19] other side of the tracks,
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:37:21] &gt;&gt; And so it's a sad sad thing to think
[2:37:25] about. And then on the other hand, it's
[2:37:26] a great thing because the gospel has
[2:37:29] gone out and many of now
[2:37:33] what grieves my heart is they don't know
[2:37:35] what I know.
[2:37:40] And they're not going to know it because
[2:37:42] I tell them. They're only going to know
[2:37:44] it because I live it. Because they have
[2:37:47] to see it. And I don't blame them, but
[2:37:50] they will. And that short demonstration
[2:37:53] of God's full adoption power.
[2:37:57] Those dread champions will raise up out
[2:38:00] of a Joshua generation and complete the
[2:38:02] work. Yes, sir. they will complete the
[2:38:06] work.
[2:38:10] So they need to be protected
[2:38:12] and they need to be prayed for
[2:38:15] and they don't need to be soothed
[2:38:18] and petted.
[2:38:21] They may need it. They may want it, but
[2:38:23] that's not what's that's not the answer,
[2:38:25] Samson. That was not the answer.
[2:38:29] It cost you more than it was comfort.
[2:38:35] You don't need to be soothed. You don't
[2:38:36] need to be petted. You don't need to be
[2:38:38] celebrated. I want to and I will. But
[2:38:41] that's not your need.
[2:38:43] Your need is to see your need
[2:38:47] and pour your heart out to the only one
[2:38:50] who can equip you.
[2:38:53] Because as sure as I'm standing here,
[2:38:56] the Moses generation is leaving us one
[2:38:59] at a time. And the only reason why
[2:39:02] they're not all gone is because God has
[2:39:05] preserved some of them
[2:39:09] to help pray us forward. Some of us to
[2:39:13] help pray you forward. I don't care
[2:39:15] which side of it I fall on. Just let me
[2:39:18] do what he's called me to do. I was
[2:39:21] going to read you again and I'm not
[2:39:23] because I need a few minutes of of
[2:39:24] something else. But I was going to read
[2:39:26] you again this story that thrills me. I
[2:39:30] I'll do it Tuesday night. I will.
[2:39:35] But I I have an example that I love. And
[2:39:39] I think I love it so much because I met
[2:39:41] Dr. Miller shook his hand
[2:39:45] and heard him tell
[2:39:47] of what God did in Argentina
[2:39:52] because people prayed
[2:39:58] before
[2:40:00] Evita Peron was married to Juan Peron,
[2:40:05] president of Argentina,
[2:40:08] God sent from Georgia,
[2:40:12] a preacher and his wife to help
[2:40:16] establish
[2:40:17] Pentecost
[2:40:19] in Argentina.
[2:40:23] And they had little strategy
[2:40:26] and
[2:40:28] seemingly were spinning their wheels
[2:40:30] with no results. And God said, "Just
[2:40:34] just call a prayer meeting."
[2:40:36] And I love the story, but I I'll I'll
[2:40:39] leave it out for now.
[2:40:41] It culminates, as you remember, with the
[2:40:44] word of the Lord that came
[2:40:48] in September,
[2:40:50] I believe it was 51.
[2:40:53] Weep no more.
[2:40:56] The lion of the tribe of Judah hath
[2:40:58] prevailed and has overcome the prince of
[2:41:01] Argentina.
[2:41:04] Didn't look like it.
[2:41:07] Avita Peron had raised up an idol, a
[2:41:11] huge statue
[2:41:14] in Buenes Aaris.
[2:41:18] She was a necromancer
[2:41:21] and a pervert
[2:41:23] sick woman. And she was like Jezebel
[2:41:27] before her was was ruling the country
[2:41:30] through her husband, pulling them
[2:41:32] further and further and further into
[2:41:34] witchcraft
[2:41:38] and evil.
[2:41:41] Little did she know
[2:41:44] that in the heavenlies the lion of the
[2:41:46] tribe of Judah
[2:41:48] had roared.
[2:41:51] It took a few years and a lot of
[2:41:54] faithful servants including
[2:41:57] Tommy Hicks
[2:42:02] who went
[2:42:04] at brother Brandham's request
[2:42:09] to South America
[2:42:14] and God filled those soccer stadiums.
[2:42:19] When I think about the fact that just a
[2:42:21] few years that they they some some
[2:42:23] credit Pentecost beginning in 1895, some
[2:42:26] 1901, some 1904. So somewhere between
[2:42:29] 1895 and 1904, there were zero
[2:42:33] zero people that were known who had the
[2:42:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And now 641
[2:42:39] million claim to have had that
[2:42:41] experience. And that's not a long time
[2:42:44] coming.
[2:42:45] That's not so long ago. Can anybody say
[2:42:48] amen? And the same thing happened in
[2:42:50] Argentina from 1949
[2:42:52] until 1951 when God sent them in 49 and
[2:42:57] there was nobody.
[2:42:59] And in 1951 and 53,
[2:43:03] the soccer stadiums were filled with
[2:43:06] hundreds of thousands of people calling
[2:43:09] on the name of the Lord. And it started
[2:43:11] in a prayer meeting with a bunch of old
[2:43:14] old sisters.
[2:43:18] It got a hold of some young kids
[2:43:21] and they began to seek the Lord.
[2:43:24] And the son of a pastor of a Pentecostal
[2:43:27] church was so rebellious and so full of
[2:43:30] the devil that he mocked everything that
[2:43:32] God did. And one night, God showed up in
[2:43:35] his dormatory room
[2:43:39] and he ran out screaming at the top of
[2:43:41] his lungs and it started a move of God.
[2:43:45] He was in Bible school acting like a
[2:43:46] devil.
[2:43:48] It started a move of God in that place
[2:43:51] that has taken so many
[2:43:55] so many have gone on the field around
[2:43:58] the world from Argentina. Argentina has
[2:44:01] sent hundreds of thousands of
[2:44:04] missionaries
[2:44:06] to other parts of the world
[2:44:09] because somebody prayed. I'm telling
[2:44:11] you, prayer makes a difference.
[2:44:15] &gt;&gt; And if church church intercession can do
[2:44:17] that, what do you think bridal
[2:44:19] intercession would be able to do?
[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; You with me?
[2:44:24] &gt;&gt; I want to read something to you and
[2:44:26] close. I'm not ready for the musicians
[2:44:28] just yet.
[2:44:31] This comes from a message, God talked to
[2:44:32] Moses, and I was hoping to get through
[2:44:34] all of this, but I didn't.
[2:44:38] Paragraph 23. Moses was a type. Can you
[2:44:40] give me just a few more minutes, please?
[2:44:43] Moses was a type of the church, a type
[2:44:45] of the organization, the law, but Moses
[2:44:48] glorified himself instead of glorifying
[2:44:51] God as a perfect type before they
[2:44:54] crossed over into the promised land. We
[2:44:56] talked about that. And that's just
[2:44:58] exactly what the Methodist, Baptist,
[2:44:59] Presbyterians, Pentecost, Lutheran, and
[2:45:01] all has done tonight. They're seeing who
[2:45:03] can have the biggest crowd or the best
[2:45:05] dress or the biggest church or the
[2:45:06] finest pews. They're trying to glorify
[2:45:08] their organization until God's just
[2:45:10] moved out. That's right. But remember,
[2:45:13] Joshua
[2:45:14] was right in the church all the time.
[2:45:18] Joshua was a part of the of the Moses
[2:45:21] generation.
[2:45:24] &gt;&gt; He was the one who taken them over. And
[2:45:26] today, the very signs and wonders and
[2:45:28] phenomenals that's been in the church,
[2:45:30] every time they had a revival through
[2:45:32] any age, these signs has broke out in
[2:45:35] the church.
[2:45:37] &gt;&gt; Am I to believe that we're coming to the
[2:45:38] last great revival, the bride's revival,
[2:45:41] and these signs won't be among them?
[2:45:43] Sure, they will.
[2:45:45] &gt;&gt; If God's doing it, they have to be
[2:45:48] present.
[2:45:53] &gt;&gt; Just like Joshua come with Moses all the
[2:45:55] way through. But the church age ceased
[2:45:57] with Moses
[2:45:59] and Joshua took the children into the
[2:46:02] promised land.
[2:46:05] But that wasn't the end of the battle.
[2:46:07] We all know. And I believe that the age
[2:46:10] has come now. The miraculous, the
[2:46:11] phenomenal, the baptism of the spirit
[2:46:13] and power and signs and wonders, this
[2:46:15] great pouring out of God's spirit. It
[2:46:17] was the third exodus in the last days.
[2:46:20] And that's the thing that'll bring faith
[2:46:23] into the people. That'll take rapturing
[2:46:26] faith.
[2:46:28] That'll take a rapturing faith that'll
[2:46:31] take the church into glory. He said this
[2:46:35] move.
[2:46:39] Where is this move?
[2:46:48] All we need is to reposition ourselves.
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; Throw our arms around the absolute.
[2:46:58] &gt;&gt; And say, "If I live or die, I'm going to
[2:47:00] live or die by this book."
[2:47:05] &gt;&gt; I need the I need the message. I need my
[2:47:08] pastor. I need the five-fold ministry.
[2:47:11] But that word
[2:47:14] is my anchor.
[2:47:17] Because men can fail me and disappoint
[2:47:19] me, but the word never fails.
[2:47:24] &gt;&gt; Men have a tendency to say one thing and
[2:47:26] do another sometime, but the word never
[2:47:29] compromises. The word never fails.
[2:47:33] &gt;&gt; He said, I believe this age has come
[2:47:34] now. He said, "How can the church be
[2:47:38] raptured when we haven't even got faith
[2:47:42] for healing?" This isn't to This isn't
[2:47:45] to belittle anybody that's sick.
[2:47:48] We've got to have rapturing faith first.
[2:47:50] That's right. How that God moves by his
[2:47:52] spirit. Signs and wonders begin to
[2:47:54] follow everywhere. God begins to move.
[2:47:56] Signs and wonders follows God. The world
[2:47:58] has always stoen criticized it from Adam
[2:48:00] down. They've done it every time. It's
[2:48:02] nothing new today that you should be
[2:48:04] criticized for accepting Jesus Christ.
[2:48:07] Now, if you accept it in some fanaticism
[2:48:09] or persecuted for the wrong thing, well,
[2:48:11] you deserve it.
[2:48:14] But he said, "Now look, if you've really
[2:48:17] God is working with you, proving himself
[2:48:18] by Bible evidence of signs and wonders,
[2:48:21] then you rejoice and be exceedingly
[2:48:23] glad, for great is your reward in
[2:48:25] heaven." Are you here?
[2:48:29] For great is your reward
[2:48:32] in heaven. Moses in his journey bringing
[2:48:34] the children of Israel, God gave him a
[2:48:36] promise. Now, as God led that in the
[2:48:38] natural, led that in the natural, so is
[2:48:41] he leading the church today in the
[2:48:42] spiritual. He's He has to be. He has to
[2:48:45] be.
[2:48:47] &gt;&gt; Now, they were going to a promised land
[2:48:48] out of a chaos into a promised land from
[2:48:51] the ridiculous.
[2:48:54] Isn't that where we are in the
[2:48:56] ridiculous?
[2:48:58] This world around us. We need to move
[2:49:01] into the se into into the sublime.
[2:49:07] Musicians, come on. I I can't get to it.
[2:49:19] I want to I want to make sure before we
[2:49:21] go that you understand who this Joshua
[2:49:24] is that's going to lead this generation.
[2:49:28] It won't be a preacher or a or a
[2:49:30] prophet. It won't be an apostle, an
[2:49:32] evangelist.
[2:49:33] In the in the adoption message, what an
[2:49:35] appropriate message. Paragraph 69. Our
[2:49:38] Ephesians,
[2:49:41] our Joshua,
[2:49:44] &gt;&gt; which is the Holy Spirit. Joshua means
[2:49:46] Jesus, Savior, Yeshua.
[2:49:50] Joshua meaning the Holy Spirit
[2:49:52] representing it in the spiritual as that
[2:49:54] was in the natural that he is our great
[2:49:57] warrior. The Holy Ghost is our great
[2:50:01] warrior. He's our great leader.
[2:50:06] &gt;&gt; We're going to follow him across the
[2:50:08] Jordan
[2:50:09] &gt;&gt; into the inheritance of the promise. As
[2:50:13] God was with Joshua, so is God in the
[2:50:15] Holy Spirit moving
[2:50:19] us about
[2:50:23] &gt;&gt; getting us repositioned
[2:50:26] &gt;&gt; on the absolute.
[2:50:31] As God was,
[2:50:34] where am I? He's our great leader. As
[2:50:36] God was with Joshua,
[2:50:39] so is God in the Holy Spirit moving us
[2:50:41] about. Thank you. And when sin comes in
[2:50:43] the camp, listen now.
[2:50:48] And when sin comes in the camp,
[2:50:53] the Holy Spirit demands a halt.
[2:50:57] &gt;&gt; What's wrong here in this church?
[2:50:59] Something's wrong. Oh, can't you see how
[2:51:02] we got too many sons of kiche now?
[2:51:06] Too many souls
[2:51:09] coming from seminaries and theological
[2:51:11] schools and going out and teaching this
[2:51:13] perverse things
[2:51:15] as the Bible said they would do.
[2:51:19] Seemingly not having the faith,
[2:51:21] separating themselves from you, having
[2:51:23] no fellowship with you and so forth,
[2:51:24] having a form of godliness and denying
[2:51:26] the power thereof from such turn away.
[2:51:29] They don't know where they come from.
[2:51:34] They can't give
[2:51:37] any
[2:51:38] reason.
[2:51:42] We read that in the '9s
[2:51:45] and we're sure it's the Pentecostal
[2:51:48] denominations, the Samson of our day
[2:51:51] who's fallen. And now we read it in 2026
[2:51:54] and and we're not so sure that it was
[2:51:58] just the old Pentecostal mess. But even
[2:52:02] in our own ranks and perhaps even in our
[2:52:05] own church, we've let the Holy Ghost
[2:52:07] slip.
[2:52:09] Perhaps we're not making room for him as
[2:52:12] much as we have in times past. And God
[2:52:15] is giving us an opportunity
[2:52:18] &gt;&gt; to go back to the basic
[2:52:21] and let God be God.
[2:52:24] &gt;&gt; Anybody want God to be God
[2:52:27] &gt;&gt; with all my heart? That's what I want.
[2:52:30] This Joshua generation will not walk in
[2:52:33] bride pride but will be dressed in the
[2:52:36] righteous garment of humility.
[2:52:42] You you can put on
[2:52:46] false humility,
[2:52:49] but it doesn't penetrate
[2:52:54] bondage and addiction
[2:52:56] in people's lives like the true humility
[2:53:00] of the Holy Spirit. There's a time to
[2:53:04] plat the whip.
[2:53:08] There's also a time to weep
[2:53:12] and there's also a time to say,
[2:53:15] "I'm starting over.
[2:53:18] I'm going back to what I know."
[2:53:22] If David would have taken the new and
[2:53:25] wore the ecclesiastical garments that
[2:53:27] Saul was willing to give him to go into
[2:53:30] battle, there'd still be not only
[2:53:32] Goliath, but all of his brothers.
[2:53:35] And you and I might be facing not only
[2:53:37] spiritual giants, but we might be facing
[2:53:39] physical giants even in this day had
[2:53:41] that thing not been dealt with.
[2:53:46] But he said, I it's mighty nice of you,
[2:53:49] king, but I' I've never proven that
[2:53:51] ecclesiastical vest. I I wouldn't know.
[2:53:54] It's too big for me.
[2:53:57] I'll just go with what I know.
[2:54:00] A slingshot
[2:54:02] and some smooth stones.
[2:54:04] Hallelujah.
[2:54:07] &gt;&gt; And he went down to the valley of Elah
[2:54:10] and he picked up five smooth stones.
[2:54:13] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Brother Bam loved that.
[2:54:16] F A I T H J- E S U. Oh, he loved to go
[2:54:20] through all of that.
[2:54:24] Not with the new thing, not with the
[2:54:26] modern thing, not with the improved
[2:54:29] version,
[2:54:31] but with all he knew. This is what took
[2:54:35] down the bear. And this is what dealt
[2:54:37] with the lion. And this is what I know
[2:54:39] God will use to deal with this
[2:54:42] uncircumcised Philistine. You see, a
[2:54:44] Joshua generation will have to go back
[2:54:47] to the simplicity of their forefathers
[2:54:49] when they learned to trust God against
[2:54:52] all odds.
[2:54:55] when there was no reason to believe.
[2:54:59] Many of our forefathers were first
[2:55:01] generation Pentecostals who who weren't
[2:55:04] raised in Pentecostal environment.
[2:55:10] I even heard Jimmy Swagger one time in a
[2:55:13] youth camp
[2:55:16] that we were
[2:55:18] also a speaker at.
[2:55:21] I heard him tell the testimony.
[2:55:27] His parents didn't want his dad
[2:55:30] particularly didn't want him to have
[2:55:31] anything to do with Pentecost. They were
[2:55:33] considered uh irrational and trash.
[2:55:38] And his dad wasn't much better, but he
[2:55:40] didn't want him to run down there with
[2:55:42] the with his his mother.
[2:55:45] Jimmy Swagger's dad's mother had
[2:55:48] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:55:52] And he'd he'd tell him, "You go down
[2:55:53] there one more time and let her talk
[2:55:54] that foolishness to you and I'll beat
[2:55:57] you with a belt."
[2:55:59] And he said, "I made up my mind
[2:56:02] that I had to have what she had."
[2:56:08] So against orders
[2:56:14] in fear of a bloody bottom,
[2:56:19] but I ran
[2:56:21] as fast as I could get down that dirt
[2:56:23] road
[2:56:25] in Faraday, Louisiana,
[2:56:28] and run into my grandmother's house.
[2:56:33] She'd say, "Granny, tell me one more
[2:56:34] time how you received the baptism of the
[2:56:37] Holy Ghost." And she'd say, "Child, I've
[2:56:38] done told you. I've done told you every
[2:56:40] day this week." He said, "Would you tell
[2:56:41] me one more time? You dry the dishes and
[2:56:44] I'll go sit down with you. You help me
[2:56:46] dry the dishes and I'll go sit down with
[2:56:48] you and tell you one more time."
[2:56:51] And he was so hungry and so desperate
[2:56:53] that he would do it day after day after
[2:56:54] day after day. And he said, "I I knew
[2:56:57] the details. I could have told it better
[2:56:58] than she could, but I really wanted her
[2:57:01] to tell it again because at the end of
[2:57:02] it, she would begin to feel it. And at
[2:57:06] the end of it, she'd start waving her
[2:57:08] little hands and
[2:57:14] hallelujah. And
[2:57:14] &gt;&gt; the next thing you know, she'd be
[2:57:16] speaking in heavenly language. And I
[2:57:18] knew my old grandma didn't know that. I
[2:57:20] knew that that was God.
[2:57:24] Now, the church perverted that and and
[2:57:27] and twisted that and made it a system.
[2:57:32] And they tried to build with flesh and
[2:57:36] carnality what God had birthed by the
[2:57:39] spirit.
[2:57:41] God sent a restoration prophet who
[2:57:44] preached like a man from another world
[2:57:47] about the need for a true Holy Ghost
[2:57:50] baptism.
[2:57:52] &gt;&gt; And a whole generation of businessmen
[2:57:55] and a whole generation of Baptist
[2:57:57] Methodists and a whole generation of
[2:57:59] even menite
[2:58:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:58:02] received the Holy Ghost, went for a
[2:58:03] healing,
[2:58:06] went to be healed, and received the
[2:58:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost, and it was it
[2:58:10] was part of the springboard for what
[2:58:13] we've just talked about. 641 million
[2:58:15] people around the world.
[2:58:18] numbers don't mean a thing to me except
[2:58:20] that I wanted you to know
[2:58:23] that it wasn't all man-made and it
[2:58:27] wasn't all phony and it wasn't all
[2:58:29] painted to fire.
[2:58:33] &gt;&gt; Some of it
[2:58:36] was real.
[2:58:38] Now we need this Joshua generation and I
[2:58:42] don't know where I fit again because
[2:58:48] in 1990
[2:58:50] and 93 and 95 and 97 and through some of
[2:58:53] the I could identify with that little
[2:58:56] boy.
[2:58:58] I could really identify with him. Lord,
[2:59:00] I'm one of them. Make me one of them.
[2:59:02] Let me be one of them. And now, my
[2:59:04] goodness, I'm 58 years old in a few
[2:59:07] months. And I don't I don't think I can
[2:59:11] really identify myself with that little
[2:59:14] lad. I don't care if I'm a Moses
[2:59:16] generation or a John. I don't care what
[2:59:18] part of the fence I fall on, but I have
[2:59:23] to see it. I have to see a generation of
[2:59:29] young people who will cry out
[2:59:34] for the fulfillment
[2:59:38] of this full adoption.
[2:59:44] Only God can do it. Preaching won't
[2:59:48] motivate you to do it. Only God can
[2:59:52] sovereignly
[2:59:54] instigated and inspire it and ignite it.
[3:00:00] And I don't know when it'll be,
[3:00:03] but forgive me.
[3:00:06] Forgive me if I don't have time to
[3:00:08] massage your brow
[3:00:12] and pet you and pamper you to serve the
[3:00:14] Lord.
[3:00:16] I'm busy.
[3:00:18] I'm busy in the spirit. I try to be busy
[3:00:21] in the natural to do anything and
[3:00:24] everything that I can to fulfill my part
[3:00:27] of the of the role. I just want to see
[3:00:34] God fulfilling his word
[3:00:38] in in a people that he has been
[3:00:40] positioning. He's been preparing us.
[3:00:42] He's been moving us and getting us in
[3:00:45] place.
[3:00:47] And when I see us
[3:00:50] reaching for other things
[3:00:53] and satisfied with other things
[3:01:00] and longing to have a king
[3:01:04] like other nations,
[3:01:10] why can't we have this and why can't we
[3:01:12] do that and why can't we do the other
[3:01:14] and why can't we be more like other
[3:01:16] churches? is I realize we haven't yet
[3:01:21] seen
[3:01:23] who we are and why we're here. May God
[3:01:27] open our eyes. May God open our eyes.
[3:01:31] May God open our ears.
[3:01:34] May God burn out any hypocrisy that's in
[3:01:37] me. May God restore and renew our
[3:01:41] passion
[3:01:43] for all that he has prepared for his
[3:01:46] bride. May God raise up right here among
[3:01:49] us a generation that will take God at
[3:01:53] his word.
[3:01:55] &gt;&gt; Not just talk the talk,
[3:01:58] but live this life.
[3:02:01] And if we don't if we don't do it, if
[3:02:05] these young married couples don't take
[3:02:08] this mantle and do something with it,
[3:02:10] your children,
[3:02:13] not only will you suffer,
[3:02:16] &gt;&gt; but I tell you, your children will
[3:02:17] suffer. And I'll go a step further.
[3:02:19] They're already suffering.
[3:02:22] &gt;&gt; Your children are already suffering
[3:02:24] because you won't make him your number
[3:02:27] one priority.
[3:02:32] If you won't point them way, if you
[3:02:34] won't set the example, if you won't lead
[3:02:36] them in, they'll find a they'll find a
[3:02:38] door. They'll find somewhere to go in.
[3:02:41] But it might not be where we would want
[3:02:43] them. If they don't hear mama praying,
[3:02:45] if they don't hear daddy praying, if
[3:02:47] they don't ever see a Bible in your lap,
[3:02:49] if you don't ever sing a Bible song with
[3:02:51] them, if you don't ever teach them
[3:02:56] the simplicity of the gospel, how do you
[3:03:00] think
[3:03:02] you say, "Well, my mom and daddy didn't
[3:03:03] teach me and I came to it." They're not
[3:03:05] promised that. You weren't promised it.
[3:03:08] &gt;&gt; God's mercy brought you through, but
[3:03:10] they're not promised that. He's coming.
[3:03:14] He's coming in us.
[3:03:17] He's coming in us.
[3:03:19] He's coming in us before he comes for
[3:03:22] us. He's coming in us
[3:03:24] &gt;&gt; before he comes for us. He's coming in
[3:03:26] us.
[3:03:28] &gt;&gt; He's coming in us
[3:03:30] &gt;&gt; before he comes for us.
[3:03:34] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[3:03:39] &gt;&gt; You discouraged pastor? Not at all.
[3:03:45] I'm so filled with hope
[3:03:49] because I know it doesn't take 75 young
[3:03:51] pe young people.
[3:03:54] It only takes one.
[3:03:58] Let one get his
[3:04:03] wick lit.
[3:04:06] Just that one.
[3:04:08] And if he won't go weird,
[3:04:13] just let one get his wick lit
[3:04:18] and he won't be so strange you can't
[3:04:20] talk to him or her. She won't be so
[3:04:29] but she'll be salty. He'll be salty.
[3:04:35] He won't preach at you. He'll just live
[3:04:37] it in front of you and you watch what
[3:04:39] happens.
[3:04:43] I wish somebody's soul would catch on
[3:04:45] fire. Don't you
[3:05:00] bless
[3:05:05] Jesus is mine.
[3:05:10] He's been my fourth man in the fire.
[3:05:16] Time after time,
[3:05:21] &gt;&gt; born of his spirit
[3:05:26] and washed in his blood.
[3:05:31] &gt;&gt; And what he did for me on Calvary is
[3:05:36] more than enough.
[3:05:41] And I trust in God,
[3:05:45] my savior,
[3:05:47] the one
[3:05:50] who will never
[3:05:53] fail.
[3:05:58] He will never fail.
[3:06:02] Oh, and I trust in God,
[3:06:06] my savior,
[3:06:09] the one
[3:06:11] who will never
[3:06:14] fail.
[3:06:18] He will never fail.
[3:06:24] Blessed assur.
[3:06:29] &gt;&gt; Jesus is mine.
[3:06:34] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's been my fourth man in the fire.
[3:06:39] Time after time.
[3:06:44] Born of his spirit.
[3:06:49] I'm washed in his blood
[3:06:55] and what he did for me on Calvary. Oh,
[3:07:00] it's more than enough
[3:07:04] because I trust in God.
[3:07:09] My Savior,
[3:07:11] the one
[3:07:14] who will never
[3:07:17] fail.
[3:07:21] He will never fail.
[3:07:26] Oh, and I trust in God,
[3:07:30] my savior.
[3:07:32] He's the one
[3:07:35] who will never
[3:07:38] fail.
[3:07:41] Oh, he will never fail.
[3:07:47] A perfect submission
[3:07:52] and all is at rest.
[3:07:57] Oh, and I know the author of tomorrow.
[3:08:02] He's ordering my steps.
[3:08:07] So this is my story
[3:08:12] and this is my song.
[3:08:17] Oh, I'm praising my ris king and savior
[3:08:23] all the day long.
[3:08:27] Oh, and I trust in God
[3:08:32] my savior. Oh Lord, you're the one
[3:08:37] who will never
[3:08:40] fail.
[3:08:43] Oh Lord, you will never fail.
[3:08:48] Oh, and I trust in God,
[3:08:53] my savior.
[3:08:55] Lord, you're the one
[3:08:57] who will never
[3:09:01] fail.
[3:09:04] And he will never fail.
[3:09:10] Perfect submission.
[3:09:15] And all is at rest.
[3:09:20] And I know the author of tomorrow
[3:09:25] is ordering my steps.
[3:09:29] So this is my story
[3:09:36] and this is my song.
[3:09:40] Oh, I'm praising my ris king and savior
[3:09:46] all the day long.
[3:09:50] Oh, and I trust in God,
[3:09:55] my savior.
[3:09:58] The one
[3:10:00] who will never
[3:10:03] fail.
[3:10:06] Lord, you will never fail.
[3:10:12] Oh, and I trust in God,
[3:10:16] my savior,
[3:10:18] the one
[3:10:20] who will never
[3:10:24] fail.
[3:10:28] He will never fail.
[3:10:34] I sought the Lord and he heard and he
[3:10:38] answered. I sought the Lord and he heard
[3:10:43] and he answered. I sought the Lord and
[3:10:47] he heard and he answered.
[3:10:50] That's why I trust him. That's why I

[3:10:57] heard and he answered. I sought the Lord
[3:11:02] and he heard and he answered. I sought

[3:11:18] heard and he answered. I sought the Lord
[3:11:22] and he heard and he answered. I sought

[3:13:03] who will never
[3:13:06] fail.
[3:13:08] Oh, I've never seen you fail. He will
[3:13:11] never fail.
[3:13:15] Oh, and I trust in God,
[3:13:19] my Savior.
[3:13:21] Lord, you're the one

[3:13:30] Oh Lord, you will never fail.
[3:13:36] Perfect submission.

[3:16:22] My savior,
[3:16:24] the one
[3:16:27] who will never
[3:16:30] fail.
[3:16:34] Lord, you will never fail.
[3:16:39] And I trust in God,
[3:16:43] my savior,
[3:16:45] the one
[3:16:48] who will never
[3:16:51] fail.
[3:16:55] He will never fail.
[3:17:00] We can't quit digging ditches.
[3:17:04] We can't quit preparing,
[3:17:08] &gt;&gt; borrowing vessels
[3:17:11] all the things that we've been told to
[3:17:14] prepare ourselves to catch the wave of
[3:17:17] God, to catch the bride's move.
[3:17:21] We must keep digging ditches.
[3:17:25] &gt;&gt; It's hard to dig ditches when you you
[3:17:28] see no cloud.
[3:17:30] &gt;&gt; But if God said, "I'm going to fill them
[3:17:31] up," he's going to fill them up.
[3:17:34] We have to keep doing. Be not weary and
[3:17:36] welloing for you will reap in due season
[3:17:40] if you faint not. There is no discharge
[3:17:44] in this warfare.
[3:17:46] &gt;&gt; There's no respit.
[3:17:51] You you got to show up in him. I mean in
[3:17:53] him. Not only physically, spiritually in
[3:17:56] him.
[3:17:59] It's a good idea to pray to prepare your
[3:18:03] heart.
[3:18:06] Not wait until you get here, but prepare
[3:18:10] your heart leading up to the service.
[3:18:14] Some of you could come on in
[3:18:19] from the vestibule and and spend I know
[3:18:21] some of you with small children, it's
[3:18:23] almost impossible to do, but we don't
[3:18:25] all have little ones.
[3:18:28] Five minutes in the altar
[3:18:30] can prepare your heart
[3:18:33] &gt;&gt; for what God wants to do for you and
[3:18:35] through you
[3:18:36] &gt;&gt; or three minutes on your seat there with
[3:18:39] your head bowed
[3:18:41] just saying, "Lord, prepare me for what
[3:18:44] you want to do today."
[3:18:47] I have to say you so many of you are so
[3:18:50] faithful to be here
[3:18:53] and I'm so thankful to have a group of
[3:18:55] people like that
[3:18:58] but we could prepare for the service.
[3:19:02] Some of you have never let that be your
[3:19:04] habit
[3:19:06] and you're missing out.
[3:19:08] You're missing out.
[3:19:10] Ask the Lord for simple strategies. I
[3:19:14] don't think any of us are ready or
[3:19:16] desire to make complicated equations of
[3:19:20] how to get the spirit of God to have
[3:19:23] freedom among us. Nobody wants to try to
[3:19:27] map it out with geometry,
[3:19:30] but just Lord, show me something simple
[3:19:32] that I can do that will help create the
[3:19:36] atmosphere.
[3:19:38] maybe praying more for the musicians and
[3:19:40] praying more for the song leaders and
[3:19:43] service leaders. Spend an extra minute
[3:19:46] saying, "Lord, may they not be in your
[3:19:48] way, but may they be channels of your
[3:19:51] glory, pipelines for the oil of the Holy
[3:19:55] Ghost to flow through.
[3:19:57] There's little little things, simple
[3:20:01] things that we can do to begin to
[3:20:03] prepare our hearts.
[3:20:06] Now is the time. Now is the hour. I'm
[3:20:09] not trying to whip anybody up, but now
[3:20:11] is the time for you to ask the Lord. You
[3:20:14] that have waited on the rest of us, you
[3:20:16] ask the Lord what he would have you to
[3:20:18] do and do it. You don't have to toot
[3:20:21] your horn. You don't have to make it so
[3:20:25] like you're flying a flag to show us
[3:20:27] all.
[3:20:28] Just do it. Be obedient
[3:20:31] because what you do in secret, God said
[3:20:34] if you'll be faithful, he will reward
[3:20:36] you openly.
[3:20:37] &gt;&gt; Ain't that beautiful?
[3:20:39] &gt;&gt; Don't let your right hand know what your
[3:20:41] left hand's doing. And if you'll do that
[3:20:43] and do it under the Lord, he said he
[3:20:44] would reward us. Father, here we are
[3:20:46] today.
[3:20:48] To me, a lot of the cream of the crop is
[3:20:52] represented in this room today.
[3:20:55] And I'm asking you, Lord, to help us
[3:20:58] prepare ourselves for whatever it is
[3:21:01] that you want to do in our midst. May we
[3:21:03] get all the dead cats off the line and
[3:21:07] and get all the vessels borrowed and all
[3:21:10] the the ditches dug and anything you
[3:21:13] would have us to do
[3:21:16] &gt;&gt; to get ready to host
[3:21:19] the fullness
[3:21:21] &gt;&gt; of your manifested presence.
[3:21:25] bring us up. And may there be
[3:21:28] deliverance from depressions and
[3:21:29] anxieties and
[3:21:32] complexes. And
[3:21:36] Lord,
[3:21:38] we surrender.
[3:21:41] You ought to tell him right now. I'm
[3:21:43] going to let you have your words or else
[3:21:45] you're just listening to me. You've done
[3:21:46] that for two hours now. Use your words
[3:21:50] and tell him right now what you want him
[3:21:52] to do for just another few minutes.
[3:21:54] Would you do it? Lift up your voice to
[3:21:56] the Lord. Here we are, Lord. Here we
[3:22:00] are. Shift. Well, I don't know what to
[3:22:02] ask for. Then just say, "Come have your
[3:22:04] way in me, Lord. Come have your way in
[3:22:06] me.
[3:22:09] I'm ready to do it. Whatever you'd have
[3:22:12] me to do, I want to do it. I want to be
[3:22:14] a blessing to the body. I want to be an
[3:22:18] instrument of inspiration.
[3:22:22] I want to inspire others to go all the
[3:22:24] way.
[3:22:27] &gt;&gt; I'm willing to be a forerunner in the
[3:22:29] house, Lord, if you'll show me what to
[3:22:31] do.
[3:22:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus, I surrender. I yield.
[3:22:40] &gt;&gt; You never fail, Lord.
[3:22:43] You haven't given up on us. And that
[3:22:45] that thrills me.
[3:22:48] &gt;&gt; You see all things
[3:22:51] May we keep positioning.
[3:23:00] Open our understanding.
[3:23:05] Show us the way up is down.
[3:23:10] May we cloak ourselves in genuine
[3:23:14] humility
[3:23:17] from the bottom of who we are.
[3:23:20] May we recognize that we can do nothing
[3:23:24] without you.
[3:23:27] &gt;&gt; Our reasoning, our intellect, our
[3:23:29] natural ability is only a hindrance
[3:23:32] sometime.
[3:23:34] It's our yieldedness, our willingness
[3:23:35] that you're looking for. It's our
[3:23:37] obedience you desire.
[3:23:40] &gt;&gt; May we hold to your head. May we hold to
[3:23:42] your head
[3:23:44] for such an hour as this. May we never
[3:23:48] turn loose of your head. Sing some more
[3:23:54] and go when you're ready to do that.
[3:23:58] Blessed asssurance.
[3:24:03] Jesus is mine.
[3:24:08] And he's been my fourth man in the fire
[3:24:13] time after time.
[3:24:18] Born of his spirit.
[3:24:22] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[3:24:23] &gt;&gt; I'm washed in his blood.
[3:24:29] And what he did for me on Calvary is
[3:24:34] more
[3:24:36] than enough.
[3:24:39] And I trust in God,
[3:24:43] my savior,
[3:24:45] the one
[3:24:48] who will never
[3:24:51] fail.
[3:24:55] He will never fail.
[3:25:00] Oh, and I trust in God,
[3:25:04] my savior.
[3:25:06] The one
[3:25:08] who will never
[3:25:12] fail,
[3:25:15] Lord. You will never fail.
[3:25:21] Perfect submission.
[3:25:26] All is at rest

[3:25:36] has ordered my steps.
