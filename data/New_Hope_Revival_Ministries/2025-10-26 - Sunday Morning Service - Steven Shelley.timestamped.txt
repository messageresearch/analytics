[38:18] listen to our
[38:22] words are not enough.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; But when words are not enough, Lord, to
[38:29] tell you of our love, won't you listen
[38:34] to our love?
[38:44] Oh Lord,
[38:47] &gt;&gt; you know our heart
[38:51] and I thank you Lord that my heart beats
[38:54] because you have given me life.
[38:57] But God, you go even further than the
[39:00] natural blood pump. You go to the
[39:03] innermost part of who we are
[39:06] and you see
[39:08] that life that is there that you put
[39:11] there.
[39:14] God, there's a pulsation
[39:17] that is crying out, you are an awesome
[39:20] God. You are an awesome God.
[39:24] Lord, when we use the vocabulary that we
[39:26] have, that word awesome just does not
[39:30] seem enough
[39:33] for who you are.
[39:36] But Lord, our hearts and our hands lift
[39:39] anyhow. Our words come out with the best
[39:42] that we know to give you the praise.
[39:46] But when the words are not enough,
[39:49] listen to our heart, Lord.
[39:54] I thank you.
[39:57] I thank you.
[39:59] Oh, I'm so thankful that he knows me.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; He knows me better than any human being
[40:05] knows me.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; He knows what I'm made of.
[40:11] And he knows how
[40:14] to do everything that I need
[40:17] &gt;&gt; to make it all the way through this
[40:19] journey that he's called me to.
[40:22] Do you have a need today? As you walk
[40:24] this journey, you would just like to
[40:25] lift your hand and say, "I have a need."
[40:29] Brother Shaw sent me a need earlier. He
[40:32] needs a touch in his body. Let's ask the
[40:34] Lord to do that for him. Brother Joe and
[40:37] Sister Rona writers will be leaving this
[40:39] afternoon, flying back
[40:42] to South Africa. We want to remember
[40:44] them as they travel.
[40:47] A lot of
[40:48] brother Shel's family just got back in
[40:52] last night. They need the rest of the
[40:54] Lord. They'll be leaving out Tuesday
[40:57] traveling. We want to ask the Lord to
[40:58] watch over and protect them. Sister
[41:01] Alfreda, you're leaving Wednesday,
[41:03] Thursday going back to Canada. We want
[41:06] to remember Sister Lydia to the Lord.
[41:08] All of Sister Alfreda's family at this
[41:11] time, asking the Lord to minister to
[41:13] them. continue to pray for Sister
[41:15] Jennifer Wartz and all of her family as
[41:18] they're going through the grieving
[41:20] process. I know there's travel later in
[41:23] the week. We want to pray over all of
[41:25] those that are traveling to Stephen and
[41:27] Lydia's wedding, asking the Lord to
[41:29] watch over and protect them and God
[41:32] protecting the homeront as well.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you. You got most of the ones I
[41:36] had wrote down, but would you remember
[41:39] brother Liam to the Lord? He has a need
[41:41] and he needs the Lord's guidance and
[41:44] leadership and I like what the Lord has
[41:47] done in his life and I'd like to see the
[41:50] Lord carry him to another level. Sister
[41:53] Anna Christine reached out to say that
[41:56] brother Austin and Isaiah both have a
[41:58] stomach virus of some kind and she's at
[42:01] home taking care of them. Uh we were
[42:04] told over the weekend that someone went
[42:06] to their doctor and was was told that
[42:09] there were 20 million people in the
[42:11] United States with the nora virus which
[42:14] is uh the main symptoms are stomach
[42:17] related. So um we want to pray for those
[42:20] who are sick. Some some were had tickets
[42:23] bought coming to the funeral and were
[42:25] not able to come because of the way it
[42:27] affected them. And uh pray for those who
[42:30] are fighting it. But would you also pray
[42:32] that we can walk in in uh great
[42:36] resistance of it?
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Uh if God would just let us have a
[42:41] little all of us, I'm claim I'm saying
[42:43] I'm not just saying me and mine. I'm
[42:45] saying all of us.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Be wonderful to have a little go grace.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Out across the stream, the Lord sees the
[42:56] needs that you have.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. Many of you that we don't
[42:59] even know don't know that you're
[43:02] watching this service. But I'm so glad
[43:04] our papa knows who you are and he knows
[43:06] how to meet your need. Will you sing
[43:09] this course with us as we're getting
[43:10] ready to pray today?
[43:17] Touching Jesus
[43:19] is all
[43:21] that really matterers.
[43:27] And then your life
[43:30] will never be

[44:45] &gt;&gt; heavenly father
[44:50] &gt;&gt; it's it's always
[44:54] just an honor and a privilege to come
[44:56] into your presence to feel you to have a
[45:01] witness in the inner man that you are
[45:03] there, that you are around us and that
[45:06] our lives is are in your hands.
[45:10] [Music]
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's more real than others.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; And this morning it just felt personal
[45:21] &gt;&gt; that you were willing to lay down your
[45:23] life so I could live.
[45:28] And it's your desire for all of us to
[45:30] redeem everything that we are, our
[45:34] spirit,
[45:36] our mind, will and emotion and our
[45:39] bodies.
[45:41] Father, I just want to thank you for
[45:44] this journey that you have us on.
[45:48] You become so personal.
[45:51] You show us who you are. You have shown
[45:54] us that you are faithful.
[45:57] You are everything that we need. And
[45:59] Lord, we're just looking right now to
[46:02] you

[46:06] for healing for our bodies, for
[46:08] leadership of your spirit, and that the
[46:11] will of God will be accomplished in all
[46:13] of our lives. for all the names that
[46:16] were mentioned before you. I pray for
[46:18] those that need healing in their bodies
[46:20] that you would touch them right now in
[46:23] the name of Yeshua.
[46:26] Those that need protection, Lord,
[46:29] like Pastor Brother Shelley was saying,
[46:33] go grace that we be be protected as we
[46:37] travel,
[46:38] &gt;&gt; as we're fighting sickness and prevent
[46:41] that anything would touch our bodies. We

[47:03] about us. You know our tomorrow.
[47:07] And Lord, may we just be willing to to
[47:09] to present everything to you and allow
[47:12] you to come and have your way. Help us,
[47:15] Lord, to get that grace to surrender to

[47:24] finished work
[47:26] &gt;&gt; that you have done.

[47:32] pre to practice to speak truth
[47:35] &gt;&gt; and to speak life over ourselves and
[47:38] over every situation. Put a watch over
[47:42] our mouth. And Lord, I've been praying
[47:45] and praying. Give me discernment of
[47:47] spirit. Give me discernment what is
[47:49] going on in my life and what is going on
[47:52] around me. May we see with spiritual
[47:55] eyes and may anything that is hindering
[47:58] us to see clearly may your blood may it
[48:01] cleanse may it help us Lord and may we
[48:05] walk in truth and in light
[48:08] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[48:11] pray.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:17] [Applause]
[48:19] Thank you, Lord.

[48:24] Oh, praise the name of Jesus.
[48:28] You may have your seats today.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; It's good to see you in the house of the
[48:39] Lord today.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; This young lady with Rachel, God bless
[48:43] you. We're glad that you're here. May
[48:45] the Lord bless you while you're here
[48:46] today.
[48:50] this young man with Tiffany today. May
[48:52] the Lord bless you while you're here
[48:53] today. God bless you.
[48:58] We're glad to see brother and sister
[49:00] Steel again today with us. So glad that
[49:02] you chose to be here instead of watching
[49:06] us.
[49:07] [Applause]
[49:09] They're driving over an hour to come and
[49:11] be in the house of the Lord because
[49:12] streaming's not enough.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; We're grateful to you all that you would
[49:16] do that. Glad that you could be here.
[49:18] We're glad to be gathered in the
[49:20] presence of the Lord. So thankful for
[49:22] the grace that God shows to us daytoday.
[49:26] You walk through the stores and you see
[49:29] people choosing death. The culture of
[49:32] death. Friday is reformation day. People
[49:35] have chosen death over reformation. They
[49:38] choose death every day. And our heart
[49:41] breaks because of what we see when we're
[49:44] out in public. and people uh uh
[49:47] displaying death in their yards. I don't
[49:50] understand that they pull death close to
[49:52] them. But I'm glad to have life through
[49:55] Jesus Christ our Lord. I'm thankful that
[49:58] he has given us something on the inside
[50:02] that uh you know the Old Testament talks
[50:04] about choosing death or choosing life.
[50:07] Moses says, "Choose life."
[50:09] &gt;&gt; The Lord through Moses choose life. And
[50:12] I'm glad there's something on the inside
[50:14] today that we can choose life.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; And it's not just natural life that
[50:20] we're choosing. We're choosing eternal
[50:22] life. We chosen to call on the name of
[50:26] the Lord that he would wash away all of
[50:28] our sin, all of our transgressions, and
[50:31] that he would let us walk this journey
[50:33] with him and and let him roll away all
[50:37] of the iniquity of the generations prior
[50:40] to us. that he would give us the grace
[50:43] to let that roll off of us that we don't
[50:45] pass it to the next generation and the
[50:48] next generation because we see what has
[50:51] happened by a generation that don't
[50:55] stand on the word of God or they they
[50:58] decide to mix it with their own thoughts
[51:01] and theology and the next generation and
[51:04] the next generation falls further and
[51:06] further away from truth. And and we're
[51:09] not saying that to puff up what we are
[51:11] or who we are. We're just saying, Lord,
[51:14] I thank you that that you have given us
[51:17] grace
[51:18] &gt;&gt; through all of the muddle of life that
[51:21] you would let us see truth.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; What is truth?
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I
[51:29] &gt;&gt; am the way
[51:30] &gt;&gt; and the truth and the life." And I want
[51:34] to see Jesus in his fullness.
[51:37] I want to see it in the earth. I want to
[51:41] see it in you. I want to see it in me.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Walking in the fullness of who he is.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; That's why we gather here. That's why we
[51:50] listen to the preaching of the word.
[51:52] Because we are letting all of the
[51:55] untruth
[51:57] &gt;&gt; be cut away from us
[51:59] &gt;&gt; by the divine surgeon. He's cutting it
[52:02] all away.
[52:03] He that has ears to hear, let him hear
[52:06] what the spirit saith unto the church.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; We're glad to be gathered in that kind
[52:13] of an atmosphere. Brother Cade is going
[52:15] to lead us a little more in worship in
[52:18] preparation for the hearing of the word.
[52:20] We call on Brother Austin and Brother
[52:21] Ellias today. Let these two brothers
[52:23] come to you for the tithe and the
[52:25] offering. We bless you in the name of
[52:27] the Lord as you give. All of those that
[52:29] give online, you send it by way of mail.
[52:32] However you give it, we bless you in the
[52:34] name of the Lord and thankful that he is
[52:37] the one that blesses us and gives us our
[52:40] substance. Let's worship together as our
[52:42] hearts are turning toward the hearing of
[52:44] the word today.

[1:01:57] fountain that's filled with blood not
[1:02:00] only for our salvation and deliverance,
[1:02:03] justification, but the same atonement
[1:02:06] provided healing. Lord,

[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; to know that he's real. To know that
[1:03:48] he's not only walking beside you, but
[1:03:50] he's walking in you.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated just a moment.
[1:03:54] Do you do you sing any of Terry's uh

[1:04:40] There is a land.
[1:04:44] [Music]
[1:04:51] Oh, but I'm just a peace. Pilgrim here.
[1:04:58] I'm traveling through
[1:05:00] this world of fear.
[1:05:05] My time to leave is drawing
[1:05:10] near.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; There is a sing.
[1:05:20] There is a land
[1:05:26] I'm calling
[1:05:28] for.
[1:05:31] Though I've never seen it before.
[1:05:36] I've got loved ones
[1:05:39] that are waiting on
[1:05:42] that shore.
[1:05:45] There is a land
[1:05:50] [Music]
[1:05:53] And it's not a million
[1:05:59] miles
[1:06:00] away
[1:06:03] or on some far off distance.
[1:06:08] [Music]
[1:06:10] Oh, I'll speed up
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; and there'll slow down
[1:06:17] when there is a
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; think about these words. Why am I so
[1:06:26] homesick?
[1:06:28] Why am I so homesick for
[1:06:35] just not myself
[1:06:38] here anymore?
[1:06:40] [Music]
[1:06:42] I'm waiting for
[1:06:45] that open
[1:06:47] door
[1:06:49] that leads you to the L.
[1:06:58] Oh, I'll try.
[1:07:02] Going to try these weeping
[1:07:05] nights
[1:07:07] and I'll lift my head up towards
[1:07:12] the sky.
[1:07:14] I'll say farewell to this world.
[1:07:18] Goodbye.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Cuz there is all
[1:07:25] [Music]
[1:07:28] You're all there is a land.
[1:07:35] I'm hoping
[1:07:37] for
[1:07:40] though I've never seen it before.
[1:07:45] I've got loved ones
[1:07:48] that are waiting on
[1:07:51] that shore.
[1:07:54] There is a land
[1:08:01] [Music]
[1:08:02] and it's not
[1:08:06] a million
[1:08:08] miles
[1:08:09] away
[1:08:12] or on some far off
[1:08:15] distance.
[1:08:17] [Music]
[1:08:20] I'll speed up
[1:08:22] and they'll slow down.
[1:08:27] There is a land.
[1:08:31] [Music]
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And it's not a million miles
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; a million
[1:08:41] miles
[1:08:42] away
[1:08:45] or on some far off
[1:08:50] trail.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; I'll speed up.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; I'll speed up
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; and there'll slow down.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; There is a lamp
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; cuz there is
[1:09:03] a lamb.
[1:09:06] Praise God. Praise the Lord. Praise the
[1:09:09] Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:09:15] Praise God. There is.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; How many of you are glad today that you
[1:09:20] have this revelation that there is a
[1:09:23] land?
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated a moment. Join
[1:09:28] the others that are seated.
[1:09:30] I'm so grateful to know that this is not
[1:09:34] the end.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; If in this life only we have hope, we're
[1:09:40] of all men most miserable.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; But we know that there is another place.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; And we know that our loved ones are
[1:09:47] gathering there waiting on us.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Could be any minute.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Could be any minute.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Could be any moment. What about? What
[1:09:56] about? What about? I wouldn't spend much
[1:09:58] time in the valley of what about.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; I would make up my mind to be ready.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; His coming is imminent
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; and we know it. And anything that has to
[1:10:09] happen. Are there a few things? Yes,
[1:10:11] there are a few things that need to
[1:10:13] happen before he comes for his bride.
[1:10:15] But those things could happen in such a
[1:10:18] quick order
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; quick such a rapid secession
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; until we could be out of here come
[1:10:25] morning. Hallelujah.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; You're You're not really looking for
[1:10:30] Yes, I am.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; I've had just about all of this life,
[1:10:35] this old ugly world that we can take and
[1:10:37] I'm ready to go. I heard brother Gley
[1:10:40] what he was saying about the celebration
[1:10:42] of darkness. Something seriously wrong.
[1:10:46] Something is seriously wrong with people
[1:10:48] who celebrate
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; uh darkness and death and witchcraft and
[1:10:53] uh demonology and all of the different
[1:10:56] things and skulls and crossbones and
[1:11:00] tombstones in their yard and uh
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; well it's just absolute Listen,
[1:11:04] Christian people don't behave that way.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Aren't you being judgmental? I'm doing
[1:11:09] exactly what the scripture tells us to.
[1:11:12] The scripture says that a righteous man
[1:11:14] judgeth all things with a righteous and
[1:11:16] spiritual judgment. And that's what
[1:11:18] we're doing. The scriptures clear. If
[1:11:21] you have anything to do with those
[1:11:23] things under the law, you could be put
[1:11:25] to death.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; We're just glad for grace. Amen.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; And I know people even in our own
[1:11:31] movement who um are are making uh you
[1:11:35] know strides back toward celebration of
[1:11:38] Halloween and and and stupid things like
[1:11:41] that. And and it just proves that that
[1:11:44] we don't really believe what we say we
[1:11:46] believe
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; or we would be celebrating life. They
[1:11:50] used to say dumb things like, "Well,
[1:11:52] brother Brandham never spoke about I
[1:11:54] don't care.
[1:11:56] I I could care less whether he ever
[1:11:58] spoke about it or not. It doesn't take a
[1:12:00] brain a a brain scientist or a rocket
[1:12:04] scientist to understand that it's evil.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; And uh one of the reasons why that was
[1:12:12] not an emphasis for him is he talked
[1:12:15] about a time when they turned uh
[1:12:17] outouses over and soaked people's
[1:12:20] windows.
[1:12:22] And and this was what Halloween seemed
[1:12:24] to look like. uh generations ago,
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; but the reality is it's always been
[1:12:30] dark.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us that children of the
[1:12:34] darkness, they like it when it's dark.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Because their deeds are evil.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; But the Bible said that the children of
[1:12:42] light, they like to hang out in the
[1:12:44] light.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't I don't uh there's no
[1:12:48] fellowship with darkness.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; I don't even like to roam around in the
[1:12:52] dark. I'm not afraid of the dark,
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; but I don't see any reason for people
[1:12:57] just to ride up and down the roads at
[1:12:59] night just for the sake of riding up and
[1:13:01] down the roads. Do you
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; go home?
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; You men go home to your wives. Go home
[1:13:07] to your children and don't be rors
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; unless God sending you on assignment.
[1:13:14] We're uh I heard someone uh or saw a
[1:13:16] little reel, I think it was, uh where
[1:13:19] they were were talking about uh having
[1:13:22] no other gods before me and and someone
[1:13:25] spoke and said, "Well, what about what
[1:13:28] about uh two hours on your phone and
[1:13:31] can't even pray 10 minutes?"
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; What What would you say about that? I
[1:13:36] would say that you've got another God.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Oh boy, it's quiet. I'd say you have
[1:13:42] another God.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; If you spend two hours washing your car,
[1:13:47] but won't spend an hour reading your
[1:13:49] Bible,
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; I'd say you have another God.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; You go to church sick, but won't I mean
[1:13:58] go to work sick, but won't come to
[1:14:00] church when you feel better.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; I'd say you have another God.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; You're being kind of Well, I'm just just
[1:14:06] how I feel. I just think that it's time
[1:14:09] to quit playing church. Amen.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; And it's time to be real.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; God's looking for realness, isn't he?
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's thank the Lord for this. I'm
[1:14:18] telling you, this is a band.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. The way most churches
[1:14:31] have any kind of music like that is they
[1:14:33] have to hire musicians. That's right.
[1:14:35] and they hire them off the street
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; and uh they don't know anything about
[1:14:40] their lives so many times. God is good
[1:14:42] to us. He's provided us with anointed
[1:14:45] musicians
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; who volunteer their gifts to the Lord
[1:14:49] and we believe that God blesses them
[1:14:51] abundantly for that. Amen.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your prayers for us. We we
[1:14:56] can't um speak of our own suffering
[1:14:58] because we didn't uh drive. We didn't
[1:15:03] ride in the van and we we think about
[1:15:05] the long drive of driving all night,
[1:15:08] leaving here Tuesday night after church.
[1:15:10] We all said goodbye to them and then
[1:15:13] beat them there by flying out very early
[1:15:16] the next morning. And we thank brother
[1:15:17] R.J. for getting up very early. He's up
[1:15:20] early anyway, but not usually at my
[1:15:23] house. So, uh, we appreciate him taking
[1:15:25] us to the airport. Hawk left a family
[1:15:28] gathering last night to come and bring
[1:15:30] us home from the airport. And we
[1:15:32] appreciate that. We appreciate the
[1:15:34] presence of the Lord that was with us
[1:15:36] while we were there. And and I had a
[1:15:39] little a little thing happen that sort
[1:15:41] of made me feel homesick this morning in
[1:15:44] the in in the song. And that's the
[1:15:46] reason why I asked him to sing it. Uh
[1:15:49] many years ago, I met in the '9s, early
[1:15:53] 90s, I met Brother Bobby Wartz. Uh, and
[1:15:56] I met his mom and dad, brother uh,
[1:15:58] brother Donovan and sister Naen.
[1:16:01] And uh, for those of you who know
[1:16:04] brother Caleb Don from uh, Tucson, he
[1:16:08] named his daughter Naen after Sister
[1:16:11] Naen Wartz. These were very precious
[1:16:14] people who loved the Lord. And her
[1:16:16] nickname, Sister Naen's nickname was
[1:16:19] Sweetie. And Sister Green loved her so
[1:16:22] much. They were they were dearest of
[1:16:24] friends. And Sister Green told us the
[1:16:26] last time we were with her, she said, "I
[1:16:28] am so lonesome for sweetie. I miss her
[1:16:31] so much." And you know, that was the
[1:16:33] last time we saw Sister Green. So, she
[1:16:36] she's now with her gathered on the other
[1:16:38] side. And uh as we got to the to the to
[1:16:43] the place where the funeral was to be,
[1:16:46] um an hour and a half before the service
[1:16:50] was to begin, a little before that,
[1:16:53] there was already a line of people
[1:16:55] because they had decided at the last
[1:16:56] moment to open the casket and there was
[1:16:59] a visitation announced that was just
[1:17:01] going to be passing through the family
[1:17:02] line, but they decided to open the
[1:17:05] casket, which takes much longer because
[1:17:08] people are talking and looking and
[1:17:10] whatever people do. And had it not been
[1:17:12] for brother Daniel, we might our family
[1:17:14] might not have even gotten in to see or
[1:17:17] to visit because the line was so long.
[1:17:21] And we had just gone through the line
[1:17:23] when it was cut off and all those people
[1:17:26] standing in line were not able to go
[1:17:28] through and even uh visit the family
[1:17:31] because of time. And uh when we when we
[1:17:35] rounded the corner, brother Daniel
[1:17:37] helped us to get in. We we stood by a
[1:17:39] cousin. It's it's good to know cousins,
[1:17:42] you know, there's a lot of cousins. So
[1:17:44] we stood behind the cartrides
[1:17:47] and um uh when because of that we we
[1:17:51] made a little curve to go into the
[1:17:53] gymnasium and there was a lady standing
[1:17:56] there. I think maybe she might have been
[1:17:57] sitting when we first saw her. And for a
[1:18:01] split second, I thought, "This is it.
[1:18:06] This is it." Because it looked exactly
[1:18:08] like Sister Naen Wartz, Bobby's mother.
[1:18:12] If you don't know what we're talking
[1:18:14] about, we have this we have this
[1:18:16] thought, this revelation that uh and
[1:18:19] it's been delivered to us in a
[1:18:21] vindicated way that it will be in the
[1:18:24] next resurrection as it was in the first
[1:18:26] resurrection.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said many of the saints
[1:18:29] which slept arose and walked again the
[1:18:31] streets of Jerusalem. And what else did
[1:18:33] it say? And appeared to many.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not making that up. That's the
[1:18:39] gospel.
[1:18:41] And so you you you catch a glimpse of
[1:18:44] somebody that reminds you of somebody
[1:18:45] that's already gone by the way of the
[1:18:47] grave and you wonder, is this it?
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; And of course, Brother Tim Amalong has
[1:18:55] just had a a terrible fall, some of you
[1:18:58] know that, off of an airplane and uh uh
[1:19:01] and really hurt himself bad. He's he's
[1:19:05] still wearing a neck brace for safety.
[1:19:07] and and when he saw Sister Jackie uh
[1:19:11] which happens to be Sister Naen's baby
[1:19:13] sister uh and I think she's already 90
[1:19:16] plus. When he saw her, he said to me
[1:19:19] later, he said, "Brother Steve, I I
[1:19:21] thought all of a sudden, oh my goodness,
[1:19:23] I guess my my
[1:19:26] the blast to my head, the bump to my
[1:19:28] head was worse than I thought."
[1:19:32] because he said, "I thought Sister Naen
[1:19:35] had already died." And there she stood.
[1:19:38] So his wasn't quite as spiritual as
[1:19:40] mine. He blamed it on his headbang. But
[1:19:44] I thought for a moment, this is it.
[1:19:48] This is the resurrection.
[1:19:50] And you know, I'm disappointed when I
[1:19:52] realized not yet.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Not yet. We're that close.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; You certainly should be ready. Yes, he
[1:20:00] is.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; You certainly should be ready.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; So, thank you for your prayers for us.
[1:20:06] God was gracious and he was good to us.
[1:20:08] He gave us lots of time and favor with
[1:20:10] the family and we appreciate that so
[1:20:13] much. And uh they asked me several times
[1:20:16] to thank you for your prayers for them.
[1:20:19] I really do appreciate that. We're
[1:20:21] looking forward to ministry this week.
[1:20:23] We'll be uh ministering on Thursday
[1:20:26] night in Cookamo, Indiana for brother
[1:20:28] Dwey Moss and and then on Sunday for our
[1:20:31] for former Amish brothers and sisters
[1:20:34] and we're looking forward to that. And
[1:20:36] brother Gry has already told us that
[1:20:37] it's Stephen and Lydia's wedding and
[1:20:40] this is his last Sunday as a as a single
[1:20:43] man. And I don't know if that's anything
[1:20:46] to celebrate or not, but I'm sure he's a
[1:20:50] thought of it. I'm sure it's crossed his
[1:20:52] mind that next Sunday he'll be a married
[1:20:55] man and he gets one chance.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; This is it.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; And so he has certainly considered it
[1:21:05] prayerfully and we should. It's a big
[1:21:06] decision,
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; a lifelong decision.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; So pray for us. We are leaving Tuesday
[1:21:12] morning and will not be home until the
[1:21:14] Wednesday of the following week. And we
[1:21:17] have committed along the way and we've
[1:21:19] actually turned down a couple of
[1:21:20] invitations already for ministry on the
[1:21:22] way home or a week trip would become two
[1:21:25] weeks in a short amount of time. Uh pray
[1:21:28] for for all the preparation that will be
[1:21:31] going on there that God's grace will be
[1:21:33] upon every detail and pray for the
[1:21:36] service here. Uh because there'll be
[1:21:38] quite a few missing and I don't know how
[1:21:40] to tell you as a pastor how that feels.
[1:21:43] Uh but it doesn't make me feel good at
[1:21:45] all to know that I'm leaving. And of
[1:21:48] course, brother Gley is more than
[1:21:50] capable of of filling the pullpit, but I
[1:21:53] I just feel for the people that uh are
[1:21:56] unable to be to go and and and are here
[1:21:59] and then the music will be slightly
[1:22:01] different and so forth. So, just know
[1:22:03] that our hearts will be home and we'll
[1:22:06] be thinking about you and we'll be
[1:22:08] believing that God will do something so
[1:22:10] grand and so special uh that you'll
[1:22:13] you'll have such a double blessing that
[1:22:15] you won't even know that anybody's
[1:22:17] missing.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Somebody say that's impossible. It is
[1:22:20] not.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; You get in the fullness of the presence
[1:22:23] of God and you don't care who's there.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; None of it matters. Amen. Let's stand
[1:22:28] for the reading of God's word. Ephesians
[1:22:30] chapter 2 verse 10.
[1:22:35] For we are his workmanship.
[1:22:40] I read this to you Tuesday evening
[1:22:42] before we left. Created
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; in
[1:22:47] what?
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; In Christ Jesus
[1:22:50] unto good works. You were created for
[1:22:53] good works. Amen.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; You were created to behave yourself.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; As you are his workmanship.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Which God hath before ordained that we
[1:23:07] should walk in them. What? The good
[1:23:10] works of Christ Jesus.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Not just good deeds, but in the good
[1:23:14] works of Christ Jesus, his particular
[1:23:20] and specific works. Now turn if you uh
[1:23:25] have your Bible to Mark chapter 16.
[1:23:29] We've also recently read this, but I
[1:23:32] want to read it again beginning in verse
[1:23:34] 15. And uh uh he said unto them, "Go ye
[1:23:40] into all the world and preach the
[1:23:44] gospel."
[1:23:48] Are you reading it? Are you are you
[1:23:50] looking at it
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; to every
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; to every creature? He that believeth and
[1:23:56] isapt
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; shall be saved.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Baptism is important.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; It is not salvation. It is surrendered
[1:24:04] obedience,
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; but it is important. But he that
[1:24:08] believeth not
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; shall be damned. I don't care how good
[1:24:11] he is to anybody.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; He's just a good old boy. Well, if he's
[1:24:18] not born again, he's going to hell.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; I don't care if he washed your car, if
[1:24:24] he brought you fried chicken when you
[1:24:26] were hungry. That's lovely. That's
[1:24:28] precious. Jesus said, "You do that unto
[1:24:31] little ones. The least of you do it unto
[1:24:33] me." All of this is true. But there is
[1:24:36] no scripture from Genesis to Revelation
[1:24:39] that would indicate to us that there's
[1:24:41] any other way towards salvation than
[1:24:45] repentance.
[1:24:46] and baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:24:48] Jesus Christ.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; God has no grandchildren.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; So your mama might have been a saint of
[1:24:54] the Lord, but that doesn't make you
[1:24:56] anything,
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; but blessed
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; to have a good mama. You must also be
[1:25:01] born again of the spirit and of the
[1:25:03] water.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; He that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:25:06] be saved, but he that believeth not
[1:25:09] shall be damned. And these signs
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; shall
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't have to belabor the word
[1:25:17] shall. You know that it is not uh an
[1:25:21] option. It's not something that's
[1:25:23] offered to us. If we're interested,
[1:25:26] shall mean shall. It will it will be
[1:25:29] done in my name. Shall they cast out
[1:25:33] devils? These signs shall follow them.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Not preachers, not apostles, not
[1:25:40] prophets. These signs shall follow them.
[1:25:43] What? that
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; that believe
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; in my name
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; in my name shall they cast out
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; devils. So if there are any devils in
[1:25:56] here this morning, beware.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; There's authority in the name of Jesus.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. They shall speak. They shall.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Not optional.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; They shall speak with new tongues.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. That doesn't just necessarily mean
[1:26:14] heavenly languages. It can. It also
[1:26:18] means that we we talk differently.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; We don't talk like we did when we were
[1:26:24] in sin.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Our language is clean like our hearts
[1:26:27] are clean.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; They shall take up serpents.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; And if they drink any deadly thing, it
[1:26:35] shall not hurt them. They shall lay
[1:26:38] hands on the sick
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; and they shall recover.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; And I've been handling serpents for 50
[1:26:45] years of ministry.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Not the kind in a box
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; or the kind under a log,
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; the kind that walk on two feet.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; The apostle said, "I I fought those
[1:27:00] beasts at Ephesus."
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; He wasn't talking about lions and
[1:27:03] tigers.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Come on. Right?
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; He was talking about dark-hearted men
[1:27:08] and women.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; They shall take up serpents. If they
[1:27:11] drink any deadly thing, it shall not
[1:27:12] hurt them. They shall lay hands on the
[1:27:14] sick and they
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; shall
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; shall recover.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; And one more reading in verse 19. Just
[1:27:21] just two more verses here. So then after
[1:27:23] the Lord had spoken unto them, he was
[1:27:26] received up into heaven and sat on the
[1:27:30] right hand of God. Power and authority.
[1:27:33] The right hand of God. And they went
[1:27:35] forth
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; and preached
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; everywhere.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; The Lord
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; the Lord working with them
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; and doing what?
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Confirming the word.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; How?
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; How was the word confirmed?
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; With signs following.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together for a moment.
[1:27:57] Father, we thank you today that you are
[1:28:00] Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and
[1:28:03] today and forever. You've changed not.
[1:28:06] Your word is sure. Your power is real.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Your authority is the highest that there
[1:28:13] has ever been. You're more than able
[1:28:16] today to do above what we could even
[1:28:19] imagine in our minds. You haven't
[1:28:21] changed. Your power hasn't diminished.
[1:28:25] Your ability is the same. And we have
[1:28:28] come today, Lord, that you might speak
[1:28:30] to us from your word. And so by that
[1:28:33] authority, we command every spirit to
[1:28:35] bow to the authority of Jesus Christ in
[1:28:38] this house. And we'll give you all the
[1:28:41] praise, Lord. It's not for man to take
[1:28:43] any praise. It all belongs to you. And
[1:28:46] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:28:48] this is how we ask these things. And the
[1:28:50] church said,
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:28:56] The handwriting on the wall is a little
[1:28:58] message that uh brother Brandham
[1:29:00] preached from many years ago and I think
[1:29:05] I shared it with you. I want to share it
[1:29:06] with you again just for that little
[1:29:08] moment of review as we go forward. And
[1:29:12] uh paragraph 22 says, "But God's church
[1:29:15] is not organized
[1:29:18] under any denominational
[1:29:20] head."
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; It's organized. It is organized
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; but not under denominational head or the
[1:29:28] creeds and dogmas of men.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; It's under the headship of almighty God
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; and filled with the Holy Spirit.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; That's his church.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Well, there are lots of churches out
[1:29:40] there that don't belong to him, but he
[1:29:43] has a church.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; And his church is a universal church.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. A
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; and it's not by the by the sign or the
[1:29:52] name over the door. It's not about that.
[1:29:55] It's about what's in your heart.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; And it's about whether or not the whole
[1:29:58] word is preached.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; If the whole word is preached, then then
[1:30:03] you can know that it's his church
[1:30:05] organized under his headship. But if
[1:30:08] there are those scriptures that they shy
[1:30:11] away from and those biblical truths that
[1:30:14] they deny, then you'll know that that's
[1:30:16] not his church.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Because man has created a mixture.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; It's really a monster.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; It's not just a mixture. It's a monster.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Anything having more than one head
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; is not normal.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Anything having more than one head would
[1:30:34] be considered a monster. And that's many
[1:30:37] times what we have ended up with in
[1:30:40] these closing hours of time. A church
[1:30:42] with more than one head.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; You've got a local head. You've got a
[1:30:47] board that's the head. You've got a a
[1:30:49] sectional denominational
[1:30:52] committee that's ahead. You've got state
[1:30:54] prespits and state overseers. That's
[1:30:57] another level of headship. Then you've
[1:31:00] got a United Council, a a national
[1:31:03] United Council. that uh that's another
[1:31:06] head. And then you've got the
[1:31:08] international uh committee, all the
[1:31:11] different leaders from the different
[1:31:12] nations. That's another head. So, what
[1:31:15] you've got is a monster
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; somewhere between eight and 15 heads.
[1:31:20] But Jesus said, "You'll know my church
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; because it only has one headship.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; You can't join my church." He's telling
[1:31:29] us you've got to be born into this
[1:31:31] church. Amen. So, it's not a building.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; It's an ecclesia.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; It's a body. It's a family of believers.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; And it has nothing to do with the
[1:31:43] building. It has nothing to do with a
[1:31:46] letter. I'm going to move my letter. I'm
[1:31:48] going to put my name on the roll. I'm
[1:31:49] going to take my name off of the roll.
[1:31:52] It has nothing to do with that. It's a
[1:31:54] living, breathing, moving organism.
[1:31:57] And its theme has to be Jesus Christ
[1:32:02] taking preeminence above all things,
[1:32:05] above all leadership. It's got to be
[1:32:07] him. The spotlight is on him,
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; what he does, who he is,
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; what he wants us to do.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; He's the one that we've come for today.
[1:32:18] We didn't come to see. We didn't come to
[1:32:21] be seen.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; We came to glorify the name of the Lord.
[1:32:25] And just to be honest with you, whether
[1:32:26] you do or not, I'm going to praise him.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; I'm going to praise him.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; I I can't help myself.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; I'm not out of control, but I can't help
[1:32:37] myself.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; When I get where he is, and that's every
[1:32:41] day.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; When I get where I'm aware of where he
[1:32:44] is in me, it makes me want to praise
[1:32:47] him.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Makes me want to give him glory and
[1:32:50] honor. This church, the church of the
[1:32:53] living God, filled with the Holy Spirit,
[1:32:56] it is not organized. It is in the body.
[1:32:59] It's not organized. It's baptized into
[1:33:03] the body of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now,
[1:33:07] to say there's no organization in that
[1:33:09] church would be wrong because the Bible
[1:33:11] clearly gives us some structure for the
[1:33:15] conducting of the Lord's business,
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; but it's biblical structure,
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; not preser structure.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; And we're thankful for it. Let's go on.
[1:33:27] He said in that body made up, it's
[1:33:30] Methodist and Baptist and Presbyterian
[1:33:33] and all together.
[1:33:35] And here's the kicker.
[1:33:38] That's come into Christ. So you can be
[1:33:40] Baptist and not come into Christ. You
[1:33:43] can be Methodist, Presbyterian, and not
[1:33:45] come into Christ. But but if you want to
[1:33:47] wear any of those labels and come into
[1:33:50] Christ,
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; then Brother Brandham said that's a part
[1:33:52] of the real church.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; But that's not all.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; That's not all.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; It's not just wanting to be a part
[1:34:00] making you a part. He said that's right.
[1:34:02] And these signs Help
[1:34:06] me just a bit.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; These signs shall do what?
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Follow. We We don't follow signs.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; No. No. He taught us better than that.
[1:34:16] He said, "Remember, every sign sent of
[1:34:19] God has a voice.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; It's not the sign you follow. It's the
[1:34:23] voice you follow. Until you discover the
[1:34:25] voice of the sign, you've missed the
[1:34:27] purpose of the sign. The sign talks. If
[1:34:31] the sun turns to blood or dark, the sun
[1:34:34] turns dark and the moon turns to blood.
[1:34:36] Grand, great, biblically prophesied. But
[1:34:41] that's not enough. We've got to know
[1:34:43] what it means. What is it saying to us?
[1:34:47] What is the voice behind the sign? If
[1:34:51] God sends a prophet with a sign of Moses
[1:34:54] in his hand and then the ability to read
[1:34:56] the hearts of the people, we we're not
[1:34:59] just going to rejoice over the sign. We
[1:35:02] want to know what the voice was and what
[1:35:05] the voice said and what was the message
[1:35:08] behind the sign.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; God still gives signs today.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; He hasn't changed.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; He's still a supernatural God with a
[1:35:18] supernatural people. And if he does
[1:35:20] something among us,
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; guess what? There's a voice behind it.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; If we see God doing something out there,
[1:35:28] we know it's him. It's a God-given sign.
[1:35:31] Then there's a voice behind it.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; And we need to discover what that voice
[1:35:36] is saying.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; I don't know what it's saying, but I can
[1:35:39] tell you what it's not saying. It's not
[1:35:42] saying anything contrary to the Bible.
[1:35:46] If it's saying something contrary to the
[1:35:49] Bible, it's a false sign
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; with a false voice.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Are you following that?
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; I believe you are. And then in Luke
[1:35:57] 10:19, same verses. I'm I'm getting
[1:36:00] through with the with the review here.
[1:36:02] Behold, I give unto you power to tread
[1:36:05] on serpents and scorpions and over
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; all the power of the enemy, and nothing.
[1:36:15] You better say
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; nothing
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; And the amplified verse says, "Behold, I
[1:36:22] have given you authority and power to
[1:36:25] trample upon serpents and scorpions and
[1:36:28] physical and mental strength and ability
[1:36:31] over all the power that the enemy
[1:36:34] possesses. And nothing shall in any way
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; harm you." That's the power given to the
[1:36:41] believer,
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; not to the pastor.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:36:45] Get on here now.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Not to the pastor only.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Come on. Or
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; or or or an evangelist only.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Or an apostle or prophet or teacher
[1:36:55] only. But to the believer,
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; how many believers are here?
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Let me see. Are you really a believer?
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; If you're really a believer, these signs
[1:37:05] shall follow them that believe. Amen.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; So there is no cessationist
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; in this at all.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; So those who believe that God once
[1:37:16] healed but he heals no more.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; They're not believers.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's a little critical. I'm sorry.
[1:37:23] It's a little bit truth.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; It's just truth. If you believe God did
[1:37:28] heal, but he can't heal anymore, you're
[1:37:30] not following this book.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is what? Hebrews 13:8.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; The same. Yes.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; The same.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; What about the times he does it? Listen,
[1:37:41] here's the point. He can
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; I I I like what they said. I like what
[1:37:46] the Hebrew children said. We We don't
[1:37:49] know, oh king, whether our God's going
[1:37:51] to deliver us out of this furnace or
[1:37:52] not. But we need you to know
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; that we are thoroughly convinced he's
[1:37:57] able to.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; We We don't know. It may be his will to
[1:38:02] take us. We We don't know how it's going
[1:38:05] to be when the doctor shakes his head
[1:38:07] and says,
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; "Here's the point. You ought to tell the
[1:38:11] doctor." And many do. I don't know
[1:38:13] whether God's going to deliver me out of
[1:38:15] this or not.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you what I do know. He's a
[1:38:18] healer.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; And if he never healed me again, he has
[1:38:22] already.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; And if he has already, he can again.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; It's kind of simple, isn't it? But
[1:38:31] people get a little carried away with
[1:38:33] their deep theologies
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; and they can't even, you know, uh, cast
[1:38:39] a tick off of a dog's back.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; No authority over the devil. They can't
[1:38:43] even hardly take care of their pets.
[1:38:45] I'll show you in just a moment where
[1:38:47] brother Brandham said uh, concerning
[1:38:49] these things, he said rapture
[1:38:53] power for rapture,
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; rapturing faith. He said, 'Wh we can't
[1:38:58] even have faith for our own healing.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; How are we going to have faith for a
[1:39:02] body change?
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; So, one of the ways that God gets us
[1:39:06] ready for that great change is he allows
[1:39:11] us to exercise the authority that is
[1:39:14] given to the believing church
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; to take all authority over every demon
[1:39:20] power.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Can't get in your house unless you open
[1:39:23] the door. If you open the door, you
[1:39:25] better find out what you've done to open
[1:39:27] the door. You better shut the door. You
[1:39:30] better seal it in with the blood.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's a recliner you have
[1:39:36] to get rid of. I don't care what it is.
[1:39:38] Whatever you find that the enemy has
[1:39:41] attached itself to, somebody said, "I
[1:39:43] don't believe it works that way." I'm
[1:39:44] sorry,
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; but you can bring divi defiled and
[1:39:48] oursed things into your home and not
[1:39:50] even completely be aware of it. That's
[1:39:53] good.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Things that come. Listen, as a uh going
[1:39:56] to 60 plus countries, 65, 64, 65
[1:40:00] countries to preach. I've had all kinds
[1:40:02] of souvenirs given to me. And most of
[1:40:05] them have remained with me. But some of
[1:40:08] them went to the to the burn pile. Some
[1:40:11] of them went to the bonfire. Yes, sir.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Because And then I heard the Lord say
[1:40:15] when I was in Chennai, India, I heard
[1:40:18] the Lord say, "Don't bring anything
[1:40:19] home."
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Don't don't take any gift that's given
[1:40:24] to you home. Leave everything behind.
[1:40:28] Somebody said, "Why would that be?"
[1:40:29] Because somehow in some fa false and
[1:40:32] fake kind of religion, but demons are
[1:40:35] real.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; The religion may be false, but demons
[1:40:39] are real.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; And if someone has some kind of
[1:40:42] understanding or authority to attach
[1:40:45] some demonic power to some object,
[1:40:47] somebody said, "I don't know if that's
[1:40:49] in the Bible or not." It actually is.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; The whole reason why God is against
[1:40:53] idolatry is the spirits. He's not afraid
[1:40:56] of wood or stone or or so forth. You
[1:40:58] could use that for decoration. But when
[1:41:01] spirits are attached to it, if it's been
[1:41:03] dedicated to something other than the
[1:41:05] worship of one true living God, you
[1:41:08] bring that in and you may find out that
[1:41:10] you've opened the door. You've got to
[1:41:12] then go close the door.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; And you've got to get rid of the thing
[1:41:16] that has gained access into your life.
[1:41:19] It could be your job.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; God forbid it be your companion.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; That's why it's another reason it's good
[1:41:28] to know you've got the right one in the
[1:41:29] beginning.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Oh my. They're just running the aisles
[1:41:34] today.
[1:41:36] But it's the truth. Little tough. It's a
[1:41:38] little tough. I get it.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; But it's but it's right. Queen of Sheba
[1:41:42] paragraph 44 he said I know that's thus
[1:41:46] saith the Lord the gospel the same
[1:41:51] gospel that blinded the Jews
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; we read about this in Romans
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; the same gospel and not just Romans
[1:42:00] Ephesians the same gospel that blinded
[1:42:04] the Jews is now doing what?
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Blinding the Gentiles. blinding the
[1:42:09] Gentiles. First, the Jews are blinded so
[1:42:13] that the Gentiles have an opportunity to
[1:42:15] be a called out people for his name.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; and so this, you know, hating Jews is so
[1:42:22] wrong. And being a prejudice against
[1:42:25] someone because they're Jewish is is so
[1:42:27] wrong. Somebody said they crucified the
[1:42:30] Lord. You better read the book again.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, it was the Romans
[1:42:35] that you better read it again. It was
[1:42:37] the will of his father that crucified
[1:42:39] him.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. There weren't
[1:42:41] enough Jews in the planet or Romans on
[1:42:44] the planet or devils on the planet to
[1:42:46] take the life of the son of God. He
[1:42:48] said, "No man taketh my life. I lay it
[1:42:51] down."
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Greater love hath no man than this, that
[1:42:55] he would lay down his life for his
[1:42:58] friends.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Satan didn't kill him either.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; His father did.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; For this cause,
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; for this cause came I into the world.
[1:43:12] Hallelujah. I'm so glad he did.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; How many of you are so glad he did?
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; And so then this blinder starts lifting
[1:43:19] off after the preaching of the epistles,
[1:43:22] the letters written by these apostles.
[1:43:24] We start reading how that that God
[1:43:27] blinded them on purpose and and uh we've
[1:43:30] heard by the message of the hour that
[1:43:32] there there would be a time that uh this
[1:43:36] great grace extended to the Gentiles. He
[1:43:39] said one day the last one
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; will come in.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Are you still here?
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; One day the last one will come in and
[1:43:47] and when it does and he said you know I
[1:43:51] don't know the number but he said God
[1:43:52] knows the number.
[1:43:55] believe that
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; he knows the number.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; I don't know the number.
[1:43:59] Two billion, three billion, 100 billion.
[1:44:02] We have no idea how many, but God does.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; And he didn't do it by number. He just
[1:44:08] numbered those that were his. But he
[1:44:10] didn't just guess a number and and then
[1:44:12] say, "I'm going to bring that many in."
[1:44:13] No, he knew in his fornowledge who would
[1:44:16] receive him. And when that last one, a
[1:44:19] part of that gentile uh crowd when they
[1:44:22] come in, he said then the mercies of God
[1:44:24] would return to the Jews.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; And where are we now? We're in that that
[1:44:30] dark kind of a gray place. He once
[1:44:33] called it a lapover when he was
[1:44:34] referring to the church ages. So we're
[1:44:37] in kind of a lapover period now
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; where there are some who are under uh a
[1:44:43] heritage of Judaism raised and uh their
[1:44:46] ancestry is there. There are a few of
[1:44:48] them brother Brandham called them
[1:44:49] renegades. I'm glad there's a few of
[1:44:52] them who have seen that the Lord is
[1:44:55] right that Jesus Christ Yeshua
[1:44:58] Hamashiach that he is the Messiah and
[1:45:01] have accepted him. And there are
[1:45:03] Gentiles still accepting him
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; but many are blinded
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; just like the Jews. Many are blinded. He
[1:45:09] said because it is the same gospel for
[1:45:12] there is no other gospel but the gospel
[1:45:14] which is good news right
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; He said we have many creeds.
[1:45:23] You always hear about the Nyian Creed,
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; but but really really that that's not
[1:45:31] the biggest one.
[1:45:33] Read them all. Go through them and you
[1:45:36] will find they just got progressively
[1:45:38] worse as the early church, you know, got
[1:45:41] further and further away from Mark 16
[1:45:43] and closer and closer to the Roman beast
[1:45:46] system.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; And then they just got more ridiculous
[1:45:50] as they went along. And now the word of
[1:45:52] the pope is equal to the word of God.
[1:45:55] Kind of like gentile randommites,
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Where we try to take any man's word and
[1:46:05] make it equal to the word of God, we're
[1:46:06] walking on very dangerous ground.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Its origin is not in truth. Its origin
[1:46:12] is in falsity. And we don't want to walk
[1:46:14] in anything that resembles that. We're
[1:46:18] thankful. So thankful for what God has
[1:46:21] done in our day.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham said, "We're coming
[1:46:25] back to the final absolute."
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "We're coming back to the final
[1:46:31] absolute." And he said, "That's the
[1:46:33] Bible."
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me?
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; So they're blinded. They just get
[1:46:40] blinded. Creeds. There's one gospel.
[1:46:42] What's the gospel? it. The gospel came
[1:46:45] not in word only preaching and teaching
[1:46:48] but through
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; power through power
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; power dunamis and exusia power.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Dynamite and the empowerment for
[1:47:01] service. Both words translated power in
[1:47:05] the New Testament. One coming from
[1:47:07] dunamis, which is an explosive power,
[1:47:11] and one coming from a power that equips
[1:47:16] and thrusts us forward into doing the
[1:47:19] work of the Lord.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; If you've ever had God get on your case
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; and kick you out of your comfort zone,
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; if you've ever felt his boot in the
[1:47:29] middle of your back, then you know what
[1:47:31] empowering power is about.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; He knows how to shove you.
[1:47:36] when you need a shove.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; If you resent that, there's something
[1:47:40] wrong with you.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; I We ought to embrace it. Thank God
[1:47:44] we've got a papa
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; who loves us enough
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; to correct us
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; who loves us enough to throw us out in
[1:47:52] the deep end sometime.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; He don't turn his back to let us drown.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; He watches over us carefully like the
[1:48:00] mother eagle who throws the elets out.
[1:48:04] Hello.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; You that are sleeping, sleep later.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; This isn't your nap time. This is God's
[1:48:13] word time.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; I don't mind you sleeping when you're at
[1:48:17] his at your house.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; But not in here.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; You can even come to my house and sleep.
[1:48:25] I don't mind a bit. My fellowship is
[1:48:27] boring. You can just sleep right on the
[1:48:30] couch, slobber right over the pillow if
[1:48:32] you want to, but not here. That's not
[1:48:35] why we're here. We have many creeds,
[1:48:38] but there's one gospel. What is the
[1:48:40] gospel? He tells us power,
[1:48:42] demonstration, manifestations of the
[1:48:45] Holy Spirit. God, God doing what? Making
[1:48:49] his word do what?
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Come to pass.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; This is the interpretation of every
[1:48:55] scripture.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. when it comes to pass then we can
[1:48:58] know. He said it had to be that for in
[1:49:00] Mark 16 he said go into all the world
[1:49:03] preach the gospel uh these signs shall
[1:49:06] follow or otherwise go into all the
[1:49:09] world and demonstrate the power. I love
[1:49:11] this. What's Mark 16 all about?
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; It's about demonstrating the power.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; It's about demonstrating the power
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; of the resurrection.
[1:49:26] It's proving that he lives.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; How many of you know he lives?
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; He lives.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; But there's a proof that he lives.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; It's the demonstration of his power in a
[1:49:38] people.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Not theologians.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; People.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Just people.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Just men and women who want to please
[1:49:49] their creator and savior.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; And he speaks to them. lay hands on your
[1:49:55] brother. Lay hands on your sister.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; And they do. And God honors that.
[1:49:59] Hallelujah.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Not not heroes. Certainly doesn't make
[1:50:04] them heroes in the world's eyes,
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; but it makes them heroic in God's eyes.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Come on. He goes on to say, or otherwise
[1:50:12] go into all the world and demonstrate
[1:50:14] the power of the resurrection. He's not
[1:50:16] dead, but he's alive. and listen and
[1:50:19] listen and listen.
[1:50:23] You ever heard the preacher say, "God
[1:50:25] don't need you." Well, he he don't.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Because if I if you won't,
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; somebody will.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; But he chose
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; to call on you
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; because he loved you.
[1:50:46] The economy of God is not going to crash
[1:50:49] because you lay out a church,
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; won't serve him all the way. God's still
[1:50:54] going to have his business going
[1:50:56] forward. The kingdom is still being
[1:50:57] raised up,
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; but God wants you to be a part of it.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; The reason why it's so bad to step out
[1:51:04] of his perfect plan. It's not for for
[1:51:06] for God's work. It's not that God's work
[1:51:09] is going to go undone,
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; but you're going to miss out
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; on the reason of your birth.
[1:51:16] You were born to demonstrate the power
[1:51:19] of the resurrection
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; to show the world around you he's not
[1:51:23] dead, he's alive. And he's depending,
[1:51:26] this is what's so profound, he's
[1:51:28] depending on you.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; So he needs those that he is depending
[1:51:34] on
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; to let him work through us.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Read this. Read the rest of this. To
[1:51:43] will his will.
[1:51:46] Somebody said, "That doesn't even make
[1:51:48] good sense." Yeah. Uh, then he's calling
[1:51:50] you a buzzard.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; He called me an eagle.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; It makes it perfect sense to me.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; It makes perfect sense to me to to do
[1:52:00] his will to will his will.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Not my will, his will. How is it
[1:52:07] accomplished? By the Mark 16 company.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something. They've
[1:52:12] been there have been Mark 16 companies,
[1:52:15] groups of men and women from the time of
[1:52:17] the of of the day of Pentecost, Shàuote
[1:52:21] all the way through. They've been on the
[1:52:23] earth uh through all the darkest ages
[1:52:26] through every one of the seven church
[1:52:27] ages. God has not left himself without a
[1:52:30] witness or without a Mark 16 company of
[1:52:33] people. But the prophesied,
[1:52:37] the prophesied, pre-planned, elected,
[1:52:39] predestinated Mark 16 company of fully
[1:52:44] adopted sons could not have come forth
[1:52:47] in Ephesus to the Ephesian church age or
[1:52:51] to Philadelphia in the Philadelphia
[1:52:53] church age. They could only be raised
[1:52:55] up, that manchild company could only be
[1:52:59] raised up in the last of the last days.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; As Leodysia, the the le the seventh
[1:53:06] church age is coming to a close
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; and a bride is getting her marching
[1:53:11] orders.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; And once again, we find ourselves in a
[1:53:14] lapover age. The closing hours of le
[1:53:18] oysia around us and yet there's an
[1:53:21] invitation to a bride to become a wife.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; We're no longer just to be the espoused.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; We're to be the demonstrators.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; The provers of the resurrection.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; He's depending on us.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; In the message, Israel in the church
[1:53:41] number two, now we're going somewhere.
[1:53:44] Paragraph 136 said, "Throw it on the
[1:53:46] ground." Throw it on the ground. Turned
[1:53:48] to a serpent. He jumped back and said,
[1:53:50] "Pick him up by the tail." He did it.
[1:53:53] Turned it into a stick. Turned back a
[1:53:55] stick again. Said, "Now Moses, what's
[1:53:58] that in your hand?" And said, "Take your
[1:54:01] hand and put it in your bosom." Are you
[1:54:04] familiar with this?
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; He did over his heart, pulled it out,
[1:54:09] and it was white with leprosy. See that
[1:54:12] means the conscious of man, the heart of
[1:54:14] man is white with leprosy. Leprosy being
[1:54:16] a type of sin.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; The very thoughts of his mind. Leprosy.
[1:54:21] Sin. A plague. It's a plague. He put it
[1:54:24] back in his bosom, pulled it out again.
[1:54:26] What had to be done? When it come back
[1:54:28] out, what happened? It was completely
[1:54:30] white. Clean. Clean. No leprosy was
[1:54:33] there. It was cleaned off. Just like a
[1:54:35] baby's hand. Just like the other hand.
[1:54:39] He had a complete restoration. Now look
[1:54:42] at this. He's seen you you know that
[1:54:45] English.
[1:54:46] I know there are you know English majors
[1:54:49] here but but you you can get this.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; He's seen God's glory.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; What is God's glory then?
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Miracles, signs, wonders, divine
[1:55:03] healing. Show me.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Show me your glory, Lord. Now you and I
[1:55:09] learned that and we've understood by
[1:55:11] scripture this it's more than miracles,
[1:55:14] signs, wonders and divine healing. It's
[1:55:16] cavode. It's the heavy presence of the
[1:55:20] almighty God.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Woo that shows up sometimes and nearly
[1:55:28] paralyzes us in his presence.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; It's not just the demonstration. It's
[1:55:33] also uh becoming the habitation. We are
[1:55:36] becoming the habitation. This generation
[1:55:39] is transitioning
[1:55:41] from a visitation
[1:55:43] to a habitation
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; where God not only visits our services
[1:55:49] but he comes to service in us.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Because he occupies us.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; That's where we started with.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; That's what we started with.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; The verse is pretty clear.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2:10. For we are his
[1:56:06] workmanship,
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; created in union.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Created in union with Christ Jesus
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; unto good works. This is the amplified.
[1:56:18] Created in union with Christ Jesus unto
[1:56:22] good works. Union.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Made one.
[1:56:27] Made one. How many of you are thankful
[1:56:29] for that union?
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; And of course they scream holy roller.
[1:56:33] Holy roller. and all the other things
[1:56:35] that they want to talk about and we
[1:56:37] don't care. It doesn't bother us. In
[1:56:39] fact, in the Patmas vision, he said,
[1:56:41] "Somebody say holy roller, holy roller."
[1:56:45] That don't bother him a bit.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; That don't bother them a bit. Paragraph
[1:56:49] 210. You're a religious fanatic.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; He said that they don't even hear that.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Is somebody talking? Is the wind
[1:56:57] blowing?
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; What is that?
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; They're mocking. They don't even hear.
[1:57:01] They're completely yielded. Yeah.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Oh church, come on.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; This is the key.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; It is.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; This is the key.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; This is This is the way in.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; It's simple.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; We complicate it.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Listen, the only reason why you and I
[1:57:20] are not fully functioning in everything
[1:57:22] that God has called us to fully function
[1:57:24] in is is he puts us in and we take
[1:57:27] ourselves out and he puts us in and we
[1:57:29] take ourselves out. He qualifies us at
[1:57:32] camp meeting and by the next Sunday
[1:57:33] we've unqualified ourselves.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; He reminds us, "You're mine. I'm going
[1:57:38] to work through you. You've got it. I've
[1:57:40] given you victory and power and
[1:57:41] authority." And we get all excited.
[1:57:43] We're ready to take on the world. And by
[1:57:46] next Sunday, he's convinced us that
[1:57:49] nobody loves us and we ought to eat
[1:57:51] worms.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; So, we go from one moment as God's
[1:57:54] mighty men and women of power.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:57:59] and the next minute we need another pill
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; because our nerves just can't simply
[1:58:05] handle it anymore. Come on. I'm not I'm
[1:58:07] not trying to hurt your feelings.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to tell you that you're not
[1:58:11] working with him. You know why God's not
[1:58:13] working with you confirming his
[1:58:15] resurrection? Because you're not working
[1:58:16] with him.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; It's real simple. If I'm not working
[1:58:19] with him, he's not working with me.
[1:58:21] Well, how do I work with him? You
[1:58:23] believe what you say. Amen.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; You say what he said
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; and you believe it when it comes out of
[1:58:29] your mouth.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; And and then you ask, "Well, what if I
[1:58:32] don't believe it the first time I say
[1:58:34] it?" You already know the answer to
[1:58:35] that. Brother Brandham gave us the
[1:58:36] answer to that. He said, "You just keep
[1:58:38] saying it until you believe it. I am
[1:58:40] healed. I am healed. I am healed. I am
[1:58:43] healed." Hallelujah.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; I am healed.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; The barber's just mocking him, you know.
[1:58:52] Oh, yeah. You're healed. All right.
[1:58:54] You're tapping around like a blind man
[1:58:56] like you always were and there he's just
[1:58:59] tested I am healed.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Well well the whole story is he went
[1:59:05] back through the prayer line.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; He went back through the prayer line to
[1:59:10] get another dose and brother said I've
[1:59:12] already prayed for you. You're healed.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; He's tapping along. He said you know the
[1:59:19] first dose was good but I'll come back
[1:59:21] for a second dose. and he's just as
[1:59:23] blind as ever. And brother Baron said,
[1:59:26] "I prayed for you. Go go go your way
[1:59:28] healed."
[1:59:32] And this is part of our problem, too. We
[1:59:34] we we everything don't change, you know,
[1:59:36] overnight. And every ache we think, "Oh,
[1:59:38] it feels a little better. By the next
[1:59:40] day, it's worse." Ah, just as I thought.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Do you know that man would have died
[1:59:45] blind
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; had he had the normal attitude that we
[1:59:48] have sometimes? But he just kept
[1:59:50] testifying.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; Instead of just selling headlines, here
[1:59:54] ye, here ye, read all about it.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; He started saying, "Read all about, hear
[1:59:59] ye, hear ye, I'm healed. I'm healed.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; I'm healed."
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; He's telling the church of Christ
[2:00:04] Barber, the one who believes that
[2:00:06] miracles are over.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; God doesn't move today. He did that for
[2:00:09] the early church because that was a hard
[2:00:10] time, but now everything is rosy and uh
[2:00:14] we don't need miracles and signs and
[2:00:15] wonders. So, it's all finished. and he's
[2:00:17] kind of mocking him and he tells him how
[2:00:19] it happened and all of a sudden guess
[2:00:20] what
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; it manifests
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; in the same manner. I know you've heard
[2:00:27] this a thousand times, 10,000 times but
[2:00:29] in the same manner he said the angel of
[2:00:31] the Lord was passing through that
[2:00:34] neighborhood
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; bringing watching over the word that had
[2:00:40] been spoken.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the next thing you know,
[2:00:45] neighbor meets neighbor in the street.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Healed by the power of God.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Instead of just eating
[2:00:53] the the crust of the toast, had now had
[2:00:56] the oatmeal and a cup of coffee, healed
[2:00:58] by the power of God.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; I don't know what happened. Gorder gone,
[2:01:02] swelling, the tumor, whatever was it,
[2:01:05] swallowed, gone, disappear, and they're
[2:01:07] meeting each other. Already prayed for
[2:01:09] meetings perhaps even come to an end.
[2:01:12] But those things were still laying.
[2:01:13] Those seed promises still laying there
[2:01:15] dormant. And it took the angel of the
[2:01:17] Lord passing by to bring activation to
[2:01:20] the promise of God. I wonder if there's
[2:01:22] anyone here today. Wonder if there's
[2:01:24] someone streaming this service that has
[2:01:26] the potential promise of God laying like
[2:01:28] a seed in the depth of your spiritual
[2:01:30] womb. And all you need is to get in his
[2:01:33] presence.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Just get in the presence of the Lord and
[2:01:37] and lay there a while.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:42] I
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; I notice you got all the time you need
[2:01:44] for disc golf.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; You've got all the time you need for fun
[2:01:50] things, things that you enjoy doing, but
[2:01:53] you just can't hardly wait to get out of
[2:01:54] here.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I know your name, too.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; You can stop asking me for favors.
[2:02:06] I mean it.
[2:02:08] I'm tired of of of using so much of my
[2:02:11] energy in life. It's going to get quiet
[2:02:14] now
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; for people who won't just won't take God
[2:02:17] at his word.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; It's time for us to do it.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; It's time for us to do it. Always
[2:02:22] needing a favor, always need something,
[2:02:24] always want something,
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; but come in here not half caught,
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; half ready to praise,
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; half ready to amen in the word. Not just
[2:02:34] with your mouth, but with your faith.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. and you leave here worse than you
[2:02:38] came. And brother Brandham said it ought
[2:02:39] never to be that way. We should never
[2:02:41] leave this place worse than when we how
[2:02:44] we came in. We should always leave a
[2:02:46] little better. Not because the preaching
[2:02:47] was amazing, but because we put
[2:02:50] ourselves in a position
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; to receive the activation of every prom.
[2:02:56] Faith does the work. You take your faith
[2:02:59] and the presence of the Lord
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; and you pull that together and anything
[2:03:04] that you're believing for is possible
[2:03:06] today.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; They're completely yielded. Now, if I
[2:03:11] were to take a poll here this morning
[2:03:13] before we go home in a little while and
[2:03:16] I'm going to miss three services. So,
[2:03:17] I've got I've got I'm still on sermon
[2:03:20] number one and and that's today's sermon
[2:03:22] and then I got Tuesday nights and Sunday
[2:03:24] morning and Tuesday. Oh, don't you think
[2:03:26] brother Gley handle that? Oh, yes. He'll
[2:03:28] handle that. He'll handle it amazingly.
[2:03:30] But but but he won't preach from my
[2:03:32] notes cuz I'm not giving them to him.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; He'll preach what the Lord lays on his
[2:03:38] heart.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; So, I feel like I've got a I I've got a
[2:03:41] truckload this morning. I want to unload
[2:03:42] and I'm trying to hurry, trying to
[2:03:44] trying not to get too ugly about it. I I
[2:03:47] want a people I want to be with a
[2:03:49] people. I want to be a people. I want to
[2:03:51] be a people
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; that's completely yielded
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; and drawing their life from his right
[2:03:59] arm of power.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Reflecting his light
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; in meekness and kindness and gentleness
[2:04:06] and patience. Signs and wonders and
[2:04:09] miracles. See? See, it's not just signs,
[2:04:12] wonders, and miracles. Mark says, "It's
[2:04:14] also meekness, kindness, gentleness,
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; patience.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; You need more, Brother Shel. You sure
[2:04:20] do. I do. I sure do. I sure do. But
[2:04:23] don't forget what I have exercised.
[2:04:27] Pray for me that I can exercise more. He
[2:04:30] goes on, "Let the world call it
[2:04:31] witchcraft." Whatever they want to make
[2:04:34] us no difference because we know we're
[2:04:36] yielded and in his right hand.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; If I were to take a poll today, h how
[2:04:42] many I'm not, but if I were take a poll
[2:04:44] here, how many know you're yielded
[2:04:48] totally? What was the what was the
[2:04:50] description?
[2:04:52] Completely yielded and drawing
[2:04:56] their life from his right arm of power,
[2:05:00] reflecting his light in meekness,
[2:05:02] kindness, gentleness, patience, signs,
[2:05:04] and wonders and miracles.
[2:05:07] I wonder how many of us could throw up
[2:05:09] our hand and say, "I am." I wonder how
[2:05:11] many of us could grab a hold of this
[2:05:13] promise. Makes us no difference because
[2:05:15] we know we're yielded and in his right.
[2:05:17] Lord, I want to live in your right hand.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Just let me live. Let me minister out of
[2:05:23] your right hand. Let me let me go to
[2:05:25] work uh tomorrow in the power of your
[2:05:28] right hand,
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; yielded to you. Not my will, not my way,
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; but your way. Now,
[2:05:37] again, we've been quoting this Hebrews
[2:05:38] 13:8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[2:05:41] today, and forever. We're talking about
[2:05:43] an abiding anointing. We're talking
[2:05:45] about a corporate anointing,
[2:05:48] uh, a divided anointing where the pillar
[2:05:50] of fire was once one once once one great
[2:05:54] light and on the day of Pentecost, it
[2:05:57] divided itself into cloven tongues of
[2:05:59] fire and appeared over each of their
[2:06:01] heads. And he told us that that was the
[2:06:03] great pillar of fire that brought Moses
[2:06:06] through the children of Israel through
[2:06:08] the wilderness. That was one full
[2:06:10] complete manifestation of God. And now
[2:06:13] that divided and we're talking about
[2:06:16] we've been talking about uh the building
[2:06:18] of a corporate messiah because in the
[2:06:21] ending in the ending we could say the
[2:06:24] ending of one thing the beginning of
[2:06:26] another when Christ purchased redemption
[2:06:28] for us through his own blood. It was one
[2:06:31] Messiah on the earth and now he has made
[2:06:35] available the ability for there to be a
[2:06:37] many membered body which is a many
[2:06:40] membered Messiah. Somebody said, 'Well,
[2:06:42] that gets a little strange when you say
[2:06:44] it that way.' I know. That's why I say
[2:06:45] it that way because I want you to
[2:06:47] understand the reality of what we're
[2:06:49] saying.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; And if you need quotes, there are a lot
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; messiahes. That's right.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; There are lots.
[2:06:59] He talks about little G. Are you
[2:07:02] familiar?
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; Little G. He talks about messiaetses,
[2:07:08] those that are a chip off the block
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; of the Messiah.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; I want you to know that's available.
[2:07:15] It's possible. It's part of the full
[2:07:17] adoption process. And we need some
[2:07:19] messiahs in the house.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; And the world worse than that, bigger
[2:07:23] than that. The world needs some
[2:07:25] messiahs.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Those who are not looking for any
[2:07:28] attention for themselves, but completely
[2:07:31] yielding.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. and want to dwell and live and
[2:07:33] minister from his right hand. Not just
[2:07:36] preachers. I want to say again, not just
[2:07:38] preach. You're not getting off the hook.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; Look, look at your wife and say, "You're
[2:07:43] not getting off the hook.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; It's not male, female."
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; It's It's not preachers only.
[2:07:53] It's not deacon only. Believers.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; How many believers in here?
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:08:01] That's it.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; These signs shall follow them that
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; believe
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; are called to the five-fold ministry.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; No, them that believe.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; Believe. Believe. Believe. Believe.
[2:08:13] Believe. You better know you believe.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Come on. If you're willing to live for
[2:08:18] it,
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; you'll be willing to die for it.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Then you'll know you believe.
[2:08:25] what we're going to be talking about
[2:08:27] uh at some point. What we're moving
[2:08:29] toward is
[2:08:32] uh something that can be a little little
[2:08:35] um oh I don't want to say it by any
[2:08:38] means complicated because it's not at
[2:08:40] all but it's just a little there are so
[2:08:42] many different thoughts and various
[2:08:45] interpretations and understandings of uh
[2:08:48] what it means to to to minister. I'm
[2:08:52] going to just try to say very carefully
[2:08:54] what it uh means to minister under a uh
[2:08:59] uh a scriptural commission.
[2:09:04] Uh and and we're talking about in
[2:09:06] typology.
[2:09:08] We're you know, brother Brandham calls
[2:09:10] himself that a typologist. Wow, what a
[2:09:13] big word. And he said, "You know, I
[2:09:16] believe that God moves in types and
[2:09:19] shadows and realities."
[2:09:21] And brother Brandham used the word
[2:09:23] antitype properly. Most people who use
[2:09:27] the word anti-ype think that it's
[2:09:29] another form of form of a type, but
[2:09:32] brother Brandham used it accurately. He
[2:09:35] was definitely not a theologian, but
[2:09:38] under inspiration, he used the word
[2:09:40] anti-ype properly. Anti-ype is at least
[2:09:44] at the very least
[2:09:47] a portion of the fulfillment
[2:09:50] of the type.
[2:09:53] Not just another type, but it is at
[2:09:57] least a portion of a fulfillment of what
[2:10:02] the shadow or the symbol was pointing
[2:10:06] to.
[2:10:08] One type can have more than one antitype
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; as it moves through scripture.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; You you understand what we mean by that?
[2:10:18] For instance, the spirit of Elijah,
[2:10:21] the spirit that was on Elijah, how God
[2:10:25] used the spirit and power of Elijah in
[2:10:29] the ministry of Elijah is a powerful uh
[2:10:33] symbol of what was to come. But so was
[2:10:37] the ministry of Elisha
[2:10:39] who received what? A double portion of
[2:10:43] the spirit that was on Elijah. And then
[2:10:46] we see John the Baptist
[2:10:49] and he came with with the spirit and
[2:10:52] power of Elijah to introduce uh the the
[2:10:56] the first church age th those believers
[2:11:00] uh early believers to introduce them to
[2:11:03] the ministry of Jesus Christ. That's
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; right. They had to see who Jesus was. So
[2:11:08] right there we have already three
[2:11:11] demonstrations
[2:11:12] of a type.
[2:11:15] So we can you can say it. Somebody say
[2:11:18] why in the word are you telling us this?
[2:11:19] Because you you might want to know it
[2:11:20] later.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; We can say that the ministry of Elijah
[2:11:24] was a type
[2:11:26] and we can say the ministry of Elisha
[2:11:29] was a type. But we can also say that the
[2:11:33] ministry of Elijah was a type and the
[2:11:36] ministry of Elisha was an antitype
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; not the fullness.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; But a portion of the fulfillment,
[2:11:44] another demonstration
[2:11:46] of what God did through Elijah. You
[2:11:48] followed that, didn't you?
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; And then we come to John the Baptist and
[2:11:52] we can say the same. And then we believe
[2:11:54] I boldly believe that uh a generation
[2:11:57] ago the same spirit and power of Elijah
[2:12:00] that was on Elijah then Elisha then John
[2:12:02] the Baptist was on William Brandom.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; And he came with the same kind of
[2:12:06] forerunning anointing to introduce a
[2:12:09] people to the second coming of Jesus
[2:12:12] Christ like John the Baptist introduce
[2:12:14] the people to the first coming of Jesus
[2:12:16] Christ. But that's not all.
[2:12:18] Yeah,
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; we sometimes forget that. Was brother
[2:12:22] Brandham a type? He was. Was he an
[2:12:23] anti-ype? He was. But was he the final
[2:12:27] installment of the spirit of Elijah? He
[2:12:29] was not.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible talks about five
[2:12:32] comingings.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Does.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; And uh that means that there's coming
[2:12:38] another with the spirit and power of
[2:12:40] Elijah to the Jews.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; One of the two witnesses. Is that right?
[2:12:45] And so we we apologize to the Assemblies
[2:12:48] of God who taught us for so many years
[2:12:51] that that it was Enoch and Elijah. And
[2:12:53] and if you don't mind, we'll just go to
[2:12:55] the Bible pattern and we'll look at the
[2:12:57] miracles and the and the and the
[2:13:00] demonstration of God in the lives of the
[2:13:02] two witnesses. And it'll be easy to
[2:13:04] determine who they are. Moses
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; and Elijah.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; We see that by by observing their
[2:13:11] miracles and the demonstration of their
[2:13:13] ministry. So one day the spirit and
[2:13:16] power of Elijah that was in type and
[2:13:19] anti-ype all the way through the word
[2:13:21] will have its final installment and one
[2:13:24] of those witnesses will operate in the
[2:13:26] spirit and power that Elijah operated in
[2:13:29] in the beginning. So that just was a way
[2:13:32] for me to show you that um it's possible
[2:13:37] for instance let me say one more thing.
[2:13:39] We're kind of getting ready for
[2:13:41] something that we won't get to today,
[2:13:42] but that's the way we have to do.
[2:13:46] Um, we could say that Elijah
[2:13:51] was a type
[2:13:54] and uh Elisha
[2:13:56] was a anti-ype,
[2:13:59] but he also had a ministry
[2:14:02] that could also type something.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; You understand? because there's been a
[2:14:08] double portion promised to the last of
[2:14:11] the last day bride.
[2:14:14] So, we're not separating the ministry of
[2:14:17] Elijah and Elisha completely, but we're
[2:14:20] saying that it is possible that Elisha
[2:14:23] fulfilled a portion of what he was to
[2:14:26] fulfill as he ministered in the power
[2:14:29] and spirit of Elijah,
[2:14:32] but that he also pointed another type
[2:14:35] forward, pushed another type forward as
[2:14:38] a double portion minister. He ministered
[2:14:40] in a double portion of what Elisha And
[2:14:43] and uh the prophet to our day talks
[2:14:46] about the a bride who's functioning not
[2:14:48] only in in power and demonstration but
[2:14:51] in a but in an additional in additional
[2:14:54] measure.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; And and the book of acts talks about it
[2:14:59] in the days of the restitution of all
[2:15:01] things.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; And the word restoration is giving back
[2:15:05] everything that was there originally and
[2:15:07] perhaps lost. But restitution is
[2:15:10] restoration plus. Amen.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; Anybody following me?
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; Meaning that God's going to give back
[2:15:16] everything the devil stole.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; But there's a refreshing coming. And in
[2:15:20] that time of refreshing, there will not
[2:15:22] be only a restoration of all that has
[2:15:24] been lost. There'll be another portion.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, give me some more
[2:15:33] types for that." I believe I will.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; You know, he's digging uh Papa is
[2:15:39] digging through the bag. That's good.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; And what does he find? He finds the
[2:15:45] grain. He finds the provision.
[2:15:48] And he finds the cup.
[2:15:52] Are you Are you there?
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; He found Benjamin's cup, didn't he?
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; That was a That was a portion given
[2:16:00] back. That was not just So So the extra
[2:16:02] grain becomes the restitution and the
[2:16:05] and the cup was the restoration. and I'm
[2:16:07] giving you back what you what you used
[2:16:10] to pay.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; I don't want that. I want that to go
[2:16:13] back. Which is very prophetic. This
[2:16:15] whole this whole concept of Benjamin
[2:16:18] being the son of my right hand. Is that
[2:16:21] what he says?
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; And then there being an added portion
[2:16:24] there at the end for for a Benjamin. So
[2:16:27] that that Benjamin in the Bible, he also
[2:16:29] prophesied. I mean his life, the
[2:16:32] typology of his life, the symbolism of
[2:16:34] his life prophesies toward the Elisha
[2:16:38] double portion
[2:16:40] anointing of both restoration and
[2:16:43] restitution. What does all that mean,
[2:16:46] brother? What are you trying to say? I'm
[2:16:48] trying to say that before we can even
[2:16:51] get a grasp of a restoration back to
[2:16:55] Mark 16, God's already saying to us in
[2:16:59] the same book, in the same message, in
[2:17:01] the same Bible, that we not only need to
[2:17:03] go back to to the same power and
[2:17:05] authority of Mark 16, but that we're
[2:17:07] actually supposed to operate in another
[2:17:10] portion of that,
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; an additional outpouring of that. We
[2:17:16] call it from the third seal, a bride's
[2:17:19] revival.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; Where he tells us there's revivals here,
[2:17:23] there's revivals there. The churches
[2:17:25] have burned out on revival, but the
[2:17:27] bride has never had a revival yet.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; Another type of not only restoration,
[2:17:36] but restitution.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; It's also a type I'm hurrying. It's also
[2:17:41] a type of the spirit that was on Moses
[2:17:45] being multiplied
[2:17:47] and falling on 70 more.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; It's also a type of the day of Pentecost
[2:17:54] when the same life that was in Christ
[2:17:56] Jesus now pours out on 120
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; who stumble out into the streets and
[2:18:01] make thousands. Amen.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; This is you see a lot of people are
[2:18:07] convinced that these things diminish
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; because darkness increases.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; This is not what he tells us.
[2:18:17] If the if the world is getting darker
[2:18:20] and the church is getting looser,
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; then the bride ought to be getting
[2:18:26] brighter and operating in more power and
[2:18:30] more authority to get out of here.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; And somebody said, "What are the greater
[2:18:35] works?"
[2:18:37] Jesus said, "If I go to my greater works
[2:18:39] shall you do."
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; What are the greater works? Well, all
[2:18:42] you have to do is look at the five
[2:18:44] demonstrations of the spoken word.
[2:18:50] Five demonstrations of the spoken word a
[2:18:53] generation ago. God giving power and
[2:18:56] authority
[2:18:57] over every one of those classifications
[2:19:01] of need.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; Spirit of conviction falls by the spoken
[2:19:07] word.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Resurrection life falls by the
[2:19:12] spoken word. Nature is controlled
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; by the power
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; of the spoken word.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Tumor disappears
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; by the power of the spoken word.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; We're talking about something that is
[2:19:28] the ministry of Christ, but it's it's
[2:19:31] it's it's even that that greater works
[2:19:34] generation.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God. It's even more than what we
[2:19:38] have hoped and expected for once we
[2:19:40] really start looking at it
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; because there's a transition. Now, I
[2:19:45] said all of that to say this. This has
[2:19:47] been an argument for for as long as I've
[2:19:49] known the the truth. This has been an
[2:19:52] argument. Was brother Brandham a Moses
[2:19:54] type
[2:19:56] or was he a Joshua type? And the answer
[2:19:59] is that believers
[2:20:02] today like to emphasize
[2:20:04] that he was a Joshua type, but in
[2:20:07] reality he was a little of both. And
[2:20:11] somebody said, "Wait a minute. Where are
[2:20:12] you going?" Well, Elisha was a little
[2:20:14] bit Elijah.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; He had the spirit and power of Elijah on
[2:20:20] him, but he was also Elisha. He received
[2:20:22] a double portion.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? So, brother Brandham is
[2:20:27] often typing himself and the ministry
[2:20:29] that God had given him and God typed it
[2:20:32] that way by the angel in the commission
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; as Moses was given. You will also be
[2:20:37] given. So, the Lord typed him that way.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; And then he and I'll show you all this
[2:20:42] in another time. And then he also
[2:20:44] receives this commission where a hand
[2:20:46] comes down and points at Joshua chapter
[2:20:48] one, right?
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; And tells him that there's a portion of
[2:20:52] that commission that's his.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; Somebody say that's huge. just as big. I
[2:20:55] don't even know how to follow all this.
[2:20:57] Well, stay awake for one thing.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; Rehear it if you don't get it the first
[2:21:03] time. For another thing, if you care,
[2:21:06] you can know.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; It's not as complicated as we make it
[2:21:10] when we're half caught.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Be fully aware, alert, fully
[2:21:15] aware, and it'll it'll it will begin to
[2:21:17] make a lot of sense to you. So now the
[2:21:21] modern believing church uh folks around
[2:21:23] the movement have have loved to
[2:21:26] emphasize oh so much the Joshua part of
[2:21:30] the commission because Joshua was the
[2:21:33] one who took people into the promised
[2:21:35] land
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; and they love to tell us what it feels
[2:21:39] like living in the promised land and
[2:21:42] they're there because the Joshua prophet
[2:21:44] came and he led them in and they're
[2:21:47] there and it's milk and honey for
[2:21:49] breakfast and honey and milk for lunch.
[2:21:52] You know, it's just everything is
[2:21:54] amazing and the giants are all run out
[2:21:56] and the bride's heard it all and we know
[2:21:58] every installment of the seventh seal.
[2:22:01] We've already heard all seven thunders
[2:22:03] and we know what they're they are and
[2:22:04] we're just bathing in his glory and
[2:22:07] demonstration.
[2:22:11] Wouldn't that be wonderful?
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; But the reality is
[2:22:17] there's type and antitype.
[2:22:19] The reality is he fulfilled and and
[2:22:22] operated in a portion of both of those
[2:22:25] commissions.
[2:22:26] But there is a portion of that Joshua
[2:22:29] commission that has not yet been
[2:22:32] completely antit
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; or completely fulfilled.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; And he kept pointing to a bride.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; He kept pointing to a bride. He never
[2:22:44] pointed to another major prophet. He
[2:22:47] kept pointing to a many member
[2:22:49] demonstration.
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Aren't you worried about
[2:22:53] people here who may not, you know,
[2:22:55] visitors and so forth?" I I was in the
[2:22:57] beginning, but I reached a place where
[2:22:58] there was a faith pull. I would say it's
[2:23:01] probably coming from one or two and it
[2:23:03] was bigger than the concern.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; So, I just yielded to the to the faith
[2:23:07] pull of whoever that is who was pulling
[2:23:09] on that. And once you get to understand
[2:23:13] that that there's got to be a many
[2:23:15] membered people because it wasn't just
[2:23:17] Joshua that went into the promised land.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; He led them in.
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; He didn't just point the way.
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; He led the men in.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; How many of you know what a leader is?
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; They're walking ahead of you.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; And you're following the men.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; Here we go. And although we know that
[2:23:36] brother Brandon fulfilled a huge portion
[2:23:39] of what a Joshua commission would be,
[2:23:42] there has got to be some installment,
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; some demonstration
[2:23:48] that would take us in as a many membered
[2:23:50] body.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Doing Mark 16.
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; Fully surrendered.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; Operating in the functions and powers of
[2:24:03] the creative spoken word. You need a
[2:24:06] quote. Good. I've got 300
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; 300 more plus
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; right
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; telling us that there has to be a
[2:24:18] finishing of that commission. Amen.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; In fact, some of our friends believe
[2:24:27] that so strongly
[2:24:29] that they think the only way it could
[2:24:31] ever be fulfilled would be a one-man
[2:24:33] resurrection of a prophet coming back.
[2:24:38] It's easy to criticize,
[2:24:41] but what they're doing is holding on
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; to many passages that they don't quite
[2:24:46] understand. And in their human
[2:24:48] reasoning, they're thinking the only way
[2:24:50] this could ever happen is if God sent
[2:24:52] brother Brandham back.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; Well, that's not how this works.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; God didn't raise God didn't send Elijah
[2:25:02] back.
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; He took him off the scene
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; because he was going to send a double
[2:25:08] portion of that spirit
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; on Elisha.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:25:14] A and in the same manner the corporal
[2:25:16] body of Jesus Christ didn't come back
[2:25:19] after it was ascending here when we were
[2:25:21] reading about it earlier
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; but the same spirit that was in him
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; it came back
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; isn't that amazing
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; fell on 120 we said a moment ago that
[2:25:33] quickly became thousands. So, it's not
[2:25:36] the physical return of a body, a man
[2:25:40] that we're looking for, but it's a
[2:25:42] fulfillment, a full installment, a
[2:25:45] completion of everything that we saw
[2:25:48] demonstrated in that life.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; You see, a wave sheath offering is that
[2:25:54] a wave sheath offering. Someone has to
[2:25:57] come to maturity first to encourage us
[2:26:01] that there will be a furtherance of the
[2:26:04] maturity in the harvest.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; And this time it won't be one stalk.
[2:26:12] It's the whole field.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; It's the whole field.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; Now that is what he said.
[2:26:20] The first fruits was the binding
[2:26:22] together of the first wheat or barley or
[2:26:25] whatever the grain was,
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; binding it together and waving it over
[2:26:30] the field.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; And it was twofold. It was it was both
[2:26:34] praise and prophecy.
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; It was praise. It was thanking God. God,
[2:26:39] thank you for the seed. Thank you for
[2:26:41] the dirt. Thank you for the rain
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; that brought this barley
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; to maturity. Amen.
[2:26:49] And that's what I heard preached when I
[2:26:51] came to this truth.
[2:26:54] But I didn't hear anybody,
[2:26:58] no one, not in that day, preaching the
[2:27:01] further reality of what first fruits is.
[2:27:05] It was a prophecy. I mean, you look in
[2:27:07] the scripture, it was a prophecy. And it
[2:27:10] was saying the same God.
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; No wonder it's his favorite scripture.
[2:27:16] Hebrews 13:8, same Christ. Amen.
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; Same God. The same God that provided the
[2:27:22] dirt, that provided the seed, that
[2:27:23] provided the water,
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; that grew the plant, that caused this
[2:27:27] grain to come to maturity.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; Am I boring you?
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; Good. You're going to be even more bored
[2:27:34] than that when you see us moving on to
[2:27:36] it.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; While you're sitting there trying to
[2:27:38] scratch your head and figure it out.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be a dream after a
[2:27:44] while. Amen.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be a prophecy after
[2:27:47] what going to be reality.
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we used to could say maybe the
[2:27:51] next generation, maybe the next. But
[2:27:53] we're coming now
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; to the reality that this whole world
[2:27:57] can't hold up.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; It can't hold up
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; for more generations.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; We're coming to the last of it.
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; And if there's ever going to be a people
[2:28:15] And you ought to love that. Not not fear
[2:28:17] it. You ought to say, "Well, praise God.
[2:28:20] Why not now?
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; Why not me?
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; Why not us?
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; Let's get her done." And get out of here
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; because there is a land.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; There is a land.
[2:28:38] [Applause]
[2:28:39] Glory be to God.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; Now, let me let me let me just give you
[2:28:47] this one and we we need to close. But
[2:28:50] but this was the sort of a
[2:28:53] sort of an introductory
[2:28:56] comment
[2:28:58] because we need to see it. Just give me
[2:29:01] a moment.
[2:29:06] Let me stir your memory just a moment.
[2:29:09] He tell I'm paraphrasing now so you
[2:29:13] purists can look it up later and tell us
[2:29:16] exactly how it was said it.
[2:29:18] But he's talking about masonry
[2:29:21] and he's talking about the laying of the
[2:29:24] blocks. And he said any old mason can
[2:29:28] lay the line, the brick, the the the
[2:29:31] rock in a straight line.
[2:29:34] You understand that? Because what are
[2:29:36] you doing? You're just you're just
[2:29:37] button it up one end to the other.
[2:29:40] You're not having to worry about only
[2:29:42] thing you're then you put the next
[2:29:43] layer. You're just going to try to make
[2:29:44] sure the joints not in the same place.
[2:29:47] You put a joint over here so that it
[2:29:50] adds strength to the wall. And that's
[2:29:52] about all you're doing. You're just
[2:29:53] laying it in a straight line. Of course,
[2:29:55] it needs to be with a plum line and it
[2:29:58] needs to be straight because everything
[2:29:59] we do needs to be straight. There's been
[2:30:02] too much crookedness
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; and slop
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; and we need to take time to clean up our
[2:30:08] our mess when we make a mess in a job,
[2:30:11] all those good things. But he said it
[2:30:13] takes a skilled craftsman
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; to turn the corner
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; because you would think, well, you know,
[2:30:21] you just do the same thing. If you're
[2:30:23] going to turn the corner, well, then you
[2:30:25] just start laying it in a different
[2:30:26] direction.
[2:30:28] You know, you come right there like
[2:30:29] that. You're do you lay it there? Do you
[2:30:31] lay it there? You know, you So, that's
[2:30:34] about all you're But if you just did it
[2:30:39] like you'd been doing it, what you would
[2:30:42] have is a is a corner with no strength.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; And anybody could just come along, push
[2:30:47] that corner right out of the wall
[2:30:49] because you got to tie it in. Somebody
[2:30:51] say, "Tie it in."
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; I'm not a Mason. I don't know how, but I
[2:30:57] know it's got to be tied in. You're not
[2:30:58] going to just butt it up against wall
[2:31:01] to- wall there and then expect that
[2:31:02] thing to hold. You got to tie it in just
[2:31:05] like you were just like you were
[2:31:06] staggering the
[2:31:09] on on the straight line. He said it
[2:31:10] takes a skilled craftsman, a master
[2:31:12] mason to be able to turn the corner. And
[2:31:15] and the reason for that is is we get our
[2:31:18] eyes so much on what we're doing. And
[2:31:21] that's why we always do what we've
[2:31:23] always done. And when we always do what
[2:31:26] we've always done, we'll always be what
[2:31:28] we've always been.
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; But when we make up our mind, somebody's
[2:31:32] got to pray.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to run this thing through
[2:31:38] the word, through the quote, somebody's
[2:31:40] got to see what it will look like when
[2:31:43] the corner turns.
[2:31:47] Well, it's going to be a transition
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; just like there was a transition between
[2:31:53] Moses and Joshua and there was a
[2:31:56] transition between Elijah and Elisha and
[2:32:00] there was a transition between John the
[2:32:02] Baptist and Jesus the Christ.
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there was a transition between
[2:32:08] Pentecostals,
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; the restoration of the gifts, and the
[2:32:13] ministry of the last day prophet. There
[2:32:16] was a transition.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; And and where people made a mistake is
[2:32:20] uh that each church age, they didn't
[2:32:22] they didn't uh you know uh undo or try
[2:32:26] to redo what was already done. They just
[2:32:28] kept building on. That's right.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; And and so here's what what we have
[2:32:32] heard brother Brandham say and some have
[2:32:34] misunderstood. He taught us, he said,
[2:32:36] you know, now the the message of another
[2:32:38] age will not work.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; But a lot of folks have misunderstood
[2:32:43] that to say, well then if it was
[2:32:45] preached under Pentecost is no good for
[2:32:47] today. That's not what he's preaching.
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; He could not have been preaching that
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; because if he were preaching that, he'd
[2:32:54] be denying
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; justification, sanctification, and Holy
[2:32:58] Ghost baptism.
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So because we have full word
[2:33:03] restored today, that doesn't mean we
[2:33:04] don't need to be justified. You got to
[2:33:06] be justified
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; under Luther's
[2:33:11] &gt;&gt; sanctified under Wesley's message
[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; filled with the Holy Ghost under
[2:33:15] Pentecost, but you don't stay in
[2:33:17] justification. You don't hang out in
[2:33:20] sanctification. You don't live eternally
[2:33:22] in the restoration of the gifts.
[2:33:25] &gt;&gt; You keep moving on to the full restored
[2:33:27] word.
[2:33:29] &gt;&gt; Okay? But what he was saying was you you
[2:33:31] can't use the message of another age. I
[2:33:33] can't preach you forward into the
[2:33:36] fullness of the restoration of the word
[2:33:39] if my emphasis is Luther's
[2:33:41] justification.
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; I can't preach you forward in the full
[2:33:45] installment of the of the spoken word if
[2:33:48] my emphasis is only Wesley
[2:33:50] sanctification.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; I can't preach you forward in the
[2:33:53] completion of the word if my emphasis is
[2:33:56] just on Pentecost and the restoration of
[2:33:58] the gift. Come on.
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; And so they have taken that to mean we
[2:34:01] won't mention sanctification. We won't
[2:34:03] mention justification. And we're so far
[2:34:05] beyond the Holy Ghost. Beyond the Holy
[2:34:08] Ghost.
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about beyond the
[2:34:12] Holy Ghost?
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; He said you don't even have a new birth
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; until you're filled with the Holy Ghost.
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; He said every man has to meet the pillar
[2:34:24] of fire. Every man has to have his own
[2:34:26] Holy Ghost experience. Every man has to
[2:34:29] taste of the original mana. Don't tell
[2:34:32] me you're beyond the Holy Ghost.
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; He's in your shoe leather if you're a
[2:34:37] believer.
[2:34:38] &gt;&gt; But I can't let that message be my only
[2:34:42] emphasis
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; if we're turning the corner.
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; So you'll hear him say, "You can't use
[2:34:50] yesterday's message for today." not
[2:34:53] meaning that the truth and and we
[2:34:55] understand this because he talks about
[2:34:56] Luther and the miracle of Luther,
[2:35:01] God using Luther the way he did and the
[2:35:03] ability, the grace that God gave Luther
[2:35:06] was not just in the delivering of his
[2:35:08] message, just shall live by faith, but
[2:35:10] that he was able to keep his head
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; above the fanaticism
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; that surrounded his age. Are you still
[2:35:19] with me? 10 minutes. 10 minutes. He was
[2:35:22] able to keep his head above the
[2:35:24] fanaticism.
[2:35:25] So, thank God for the Lutheran who some
[2:35:29] were able to keep their head above the
[2:35:30] fanaticism that followed the Lutheran
[2:35:32] message. And thank God for the Wesleyans
[2:35:34] who were able to keep their head above
[2:35:36] the fanaticism that followed the
[2:35:37] Wesleyan message. And thank God for the
[2:35:39] Pentecostals
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; who were able to keep their head above
[2:35:42] the the fanaticism that followed the
[2:35:44] Pentecostal message. And God bless those
[2:35:46] who followed the last prophet.
[2:35:51] who were able to keep their head above
[2:35:53] the fanaticism that followed his
[2:35:55] message. Because we're foolish to think
[2:35:57] that that would happen in six church
[2:35:59] ages.
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, the seventh church
[2:36:01] age, there wouldn't be fanaticism.
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; There's more fanaticism that has
[2:36:05] followed this message than any message
[2:36:07] that has been delivered since the
[2:36:08] beginning of time.
[2:36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:11] &gt;&gt; Why? Because this is the finishing
[2:36:12] message.
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; This is the finishing faith.
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is the author
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; and the finisher of our faith.
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; And we're living in the finishing of our
[2:36:22] faith.
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; We're living in the finishing and the
[2:36:25] completion of the word where there will
[2:36:26] be a people who will manifest what it
[2:36:29] means to be word born.
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; Born of the word, not just born of the
[2:36:33] flesh.
[2:36:34] &gt;&gt; So, let me give you this. This is a
[2:36:36] little bit long uh uh place from pardon.
[2:36:39] And I'm going to read it and I'll just
[2:36:41] have to be done.
[2:36:43] Oh brother, our educational systems has
[2:36:47] drawn us away from it. And our
[2:36:49] denominations has separated us from one
[2:36:51] another
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; and from Christ.
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; They've not only built walls to separate
[2:36:58] us from them and them from us. But the
[2:37:01] walls have also served to separate us
[2:37:05] from Christ. That's why there had to be
[2:37:07] a restoring word. That's why there had
[2:37:09] to be a restoration prophet. Amen.
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; We had to go back to the faith.
[2:37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; It's the Malachi 4 commission.
[2:37:21] It's not just one way.
[2:37:25] Fathers to children, children to
[2:37:26] fathers.
[2:37:28] You've got to understand there's two
[2:37:30] sides to this commission.
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; All right. He said our and he said but
[2:37:36] uh and from Christ. But what they'll
[2:37:38] continue to do that and and you take a
[2:37:41] substitute any other thing any other
[2:37:45] thing it's no more
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; than fig leaves again.
[2:37:52] &gt;&gt; Wow. He said God rejects it.
[2:37:56] God doesn't want your fig leaves.
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; He found another way to cover your your
[2:38:00] nakedness. The full reveal word. But
[2:38:04] when the church comes under the blood of
[2:38:06] Jesus Christ with the token of the Holy
[2:38:09] Spirit upon them,
[2:38:11] &gt;&gt; then you're going to see brotherhood
[2:38:12] again.
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; You're going to see a church
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; full of power.
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; He said you're going to
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; God hates a powerless religion.
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; He said it's got to be power. Amen.
[2:38:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "Certainly, it's a power to
[2:38:34] save a man from sin. It's power that can
[2:38:37] do signs and wonders and miracles as
[2:38:39] Jesus Christ promised."
[2:38:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "They zeroed in on the word of
[2:38:43] God back there." Hallelujah. And
[2:38:45] believed it.
[2:38:47] And what happened? They hit the target.
[2:38:49] Nathan hit the target.
[2:38:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "You zeroed the same way on the
[2:38:53] word of God. It'll hit the target again.
[2:38:56] &gt;&gt; It's got to because he's the same." Read
[2:38:59] it. Yesterday, what
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; today? and forever. He said, "God don't
[2:39:04] like a powerless religion. God does not
[2:39:06] want that. God wants to perform."
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; Wow, that just sounds terrible. Not not
[2:39:13] really.
[2:39:15] Not really.
[2:39:16] &gt;&gt; Not to me.
[2:39:17] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, you know, I just
[2:39:19] think of a show or a circus or something
[2:39:21] like that." Well, you're thinking wrong.
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; God just wants to be God.
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; He just wants to be God. He just wants
[2:39:28] the people that'll let him be God. Amen.
[2:39:30] &gt;&gt; You see, he still has all the attributes
[2:39:32] that he ever had in the beginning other
[2:39:34] than those that he's expressed on the
[2:39:35] earth. And we could argue that there is
[2:39:37] still representation of you in him right
[2:39:39] now in the same manner that there's rep
[2:39:41] representation
[2:39:43] of him in you.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; In fact,
[2:39:49] that is the case
[2:39:51] because you've already got another body.
[2:39:54] &gt;&gt; You're not waiting on another body. You
[2:39:56] had another body before you got here.
[2:40:00] Come on.
[2:40:00] &gt;&gt; And he says this mysterious statement
[2:40:02] out just all of a sudden. Have you heard
[2:40:04] from your theophony?
[2:40:08] &gt;&gt; Have you heard from it? I've heard from
[2:40:10] mine and it's calling me. Sister Sister
[2:40:14] Craig Head.
[2:40:16] She threw her leg out there and she
[2:40:19] wrote that song. One day I'm going to
[2:40:21] take a step right into my theophony.
[2:40:25] &gt;&gt; And it's a calling. Come up.
[2:40:27] &gt;&gt; Come up. Come up a little higher into
[2:40:30] agapeo love. Come up a little higher
[2:40:32] into the perfect word. Come on. God just
[2:40:35] wants to He wants to perform. He wants
[2:40:37] to show himself alive. Jesus wants to be
[2:40:40] Jesus in you.
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; Our very hopes is the resurrection. Is
[2:40:45] that right? Our hopes of life is
[2:40:47] resurrection. The resurrection of Jesus
[2:40:49] Christ. I got to hurry.
[2:40:52] Uh maybe it's not quite musician time
[2:40:55] yet, but it's almost almost time.
[2:41:04] He said, u you see, God wants to work in
[2:41:09] his church.
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I'll be with you always,
[2:41:12] even to the end of the world. The works
[2:41:14] that I do,
[2:41:16] &gt;&gt; hello, read it,
[2:41:18] &gt;&gt; shall you do also." Praise God. Somebody
[2:41:21] ought to say hallelujah.
[2:41:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:41:25] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I can't say hallelujah
[2:41:26] because I'm not doing it." That's not
[2:41:28] what you're hallelujahing. You're
[2:41:30] halleluing the fact that he wants you to
[2:41:32] do it.
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That you're a part of his
[2:41:35] economy, that you're a part of his plan.
[2:41:39] He didn't leave us out.
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; He put us in.
[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; It's about the bride.
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; It's about the bride. Amen.
[2:41:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now the church tries to deny
[2:41:49] that, you know, the works that I do
[2:41:51] shall you do also, even more than this
[2:41:52] shall you do, for I go to my father."
[2:41:54] St. John 12:14. He said, "Now the church
[2:41:56] tries to deny that. Get a way to get
[2:41:58] some members in or to be more popular.
[2:42:00] You won't accuse us of trying to get
[2:42:02] people."
[2:42:08] Somebody say, "Why people leave and you
[2:42:09] don't even chase them?" I don't.
[2:42:13] I don't.
[2:42:17] You can't make somebody walk this.
[2:42:21] &gt;&gt; You can't sweet talk a man in.
[2:42:25] &gt;&gt; Nobody ever walks out of this group
[2:42:28] without me praying diligently.
[2:42:31] God, if it be your will, bring them
[2:42:33] home. If not, take them somewhere where
[2:42:35] they can get the finishing.
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; You got to realize you you you can't
[2:42:40] help everybody,
[2:42:41] &gt;&gt; but there's somebody somewhere. If
[2:42:43] they're gods, there's somebody somewhere
[2:42:45] can help them, provide what they need to
[2:42:47] get them where they need to go. And it's
[2:42:48] not begging people back that gets them
[2:42:50] where they need to go. It
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; it's it's desperation.
[2:42:54] &gt;&gt; And you can't make somebody desperate
[2:42:57] petting them on the back.
[2:42:59] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:43:01] &gt;&gt; He said God wants to to work in his
[2:43:03] church. I'll be with you. All right,
[2:43:05] let's go on. the God is uh uh God is
[2:43:08] trying to perform in his church and the
[2:43:10] church is trying to perform by the creed
[2:43:13] &gt;&gt; and the two can't work together. You got
[2:43:15] to get rid of the creed.
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, not just the not just the nian,
[2:43:27] &gt;&gt; even the Brandham group creed like you
[2:43:30] can't have a church without the pillar
[2:43:32] of fire picture behind you. You can't
[2:43:34] have a church, a true church without the
[2:43:37] without the cloud picture behind you.
[2:43:39] You can't have this. You can't have
[2:43:41] that. You need a belt buckle. You got to
[2:43:43] have a bolo. You got to walk bow-legged
[2:43:46] like brother Brandham did when he'd been
[2:43:47] on a hunting trip. You got to do this.
[2:43:49] You got to do that. You got to do the
[2:43:51] other. Listen, creed upon creed upon
[2:43:53] creed upon creed. And while we argue
[2:43:56] about creeds,
[2:43:58] we're missing the point.
[2:44:01] &gt;&gt; Jesus wants to be Jesus.
[2:44:04] in us.
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; And he actually doesn't want us spending
[2:44:08] our time looking back.
[2:44:12] &gt;&gt; He wants us to spend our time looking
[2:44:14] forward
[2:44:15] &gt;&gt; because the corner is turning with or
[2:44:18] without you.
[2:44:20] &gt;&gt; With or without me.
[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; God's not just building a straight wall.
[2:44:24] &gt;&gt; He's building a house.
[2:44:27] &gt;&gt; Have you ever tried to build a house
[2:44:29] with just one wall?
[2:44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:31] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[2:44:33] You've got it's got to be more than one
[2:44:37] &gt;&gt; to make you a house at least four unless
[2:44:40] you're making a lean to.
[2:44:44] You can't build a habitation for God
[2:44:47] with one wall
[2:44:49] brick laid all the same. It's the the
[2:44:52] corner has to turn. Two can't work
[2:44:54] together. You got to get rid of the
[2:44:55] creed and get in Christ. Get Christ in.
[2:44:58] And how can you do it? How can you do it
[2:45:03] when he sees the blood?
[2:45:05] When the blood has been applied with a
[2:45:07] sincere heart and a hand
[2:45:10] laid upon Jesus Christ, your sacrifice.
[2:45:14] &gt;&gt; Put your hand on his head.
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; That's your key.
[2:45:21] That's what keeps your mistakes under
[2:45:23] the blood.
[2:45:24] &gt;&gt; It doesn't keep your willful sin under
[2:45:26] the blood. You've got to repent of
[2:45:27] those. Go ahead.
[2:45:29] &gt;&gt; As long as you keep your hand on the
[2:45:31] head of your sacrifice, the Lord Jesus
[2:45:34] Christ, you're going to fall. You're
[2:45:36] going to fail. You get right back up
[2:45:37] again in grace. He calls you up to a
[2:45:40] higher place because these are bobbles
[2:45:42] and mistakes and and and and
[2:45:44] overreactions and emotional reactions
[2:45:47] and things. That's what he that's what
[2:45:49] he he covers without without even asking
[2:45:52] were covered. Just as long as your hands
[2:45:54] on his head. Amen.
[2:45:56] &gt;&gt; You take your hand off of his head and
[2:45:58] you and and you're walking on dangerous
[2:46:00] ground then.
[2:46:02] &gt;&gt; But you keep your hand on the head of
[2:46:03] your sacrifice and plead his perfection,
[2:46:06] not your own.
[2:46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:08] &gt;&gt; And you'll be all right. Now, once you
[2:46:09] know the truth and you continue to do
[2:46:11] otherwise, that's willful sin. And it is
[2:46:14] not covered except by repentance.
[2:46:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:17] &gt;&gt; And repentance is not I'm sorry.
[2:46:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:46:21] &gt;&gt; Repentance is I'm sorry and I turn.
[2:46:25] from my way,
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; from my action, from my from my
[2:46:31] behavior, from what I'm doing.
[2:46:33] &gt;&gt; Okay, now you're thoroughly asleep. So,
[2:46:36] we'll come to
[2:46:37] &gt;&gt; the God trying to per you got to get rid
[2:46:40] of the creed. Yes,
[2:46:42] God wants to perform. Yes.
[2:46:46] Through the power of the blood to get
[2:46:48] Christians born again. That's exactly
[2:46:50] the difference of it. Amen. to do. Must
[2:46:53] you you must reject. To do this, you've
[2:46:56] got to reject the Holy Spirit and his
[2:46:59] performing power to accept a creed.
[2:47:03] &gt;&gt; You can't have creed
[2:47:06] and Holy Spirit moving through your
[2:47:08] church at the same time.
[2:47:16] &gt;&gt; It's phony performance.
[2:47:18] I've seen my belly full of it.
[2:47:24] I'm worshiping.
[2:47:29] It's disgusting.
[2:47:32] It's not just your song he's after.
[2:47:35] &gt;&gt; Not just your body language he's looking
[2:47:37] for. It's your heart.
[2:47:42] &gt;&gt; I I I just don't I just like real. I'd
[2:47:45] rather you be raw and real,
[2:47:49] unpolished and real, than to be a phony.
[2:47:54] Come on. God's looking for f. He He
[2:47:57] knows
[2:47:59] He knows that we're raw. He knows that
[2:48:02] we've been through junk.
[2:48:05] He knows that we hadn't always got it
[2:48:07] right.
[2:48:08] &gt;&gt; But he also knows whether or not we're
[2:48:10] sincere and real
[2:48:12] &gt;&gt; or whether we're putting on a show.
[2:48:14] That's right.
[2:48:14] &gt;&gt; He knows.
[2:48:19] &gt;&gt; He knows whether it comes from the sun
[2:48:21] or out of a bottle.
[2:48:25] &gt;&gt; He knows whether he give it to you or
[2:48:27] you bought it at the drugstore.
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; He knows the difference between real and
[2:48:32] phony.
[2:48:37] &gt;&gt; And there's coming a mark. There's
[2:48:39] coming a day.
[2:48:41] Musicians are coming. This is a good
[2:48:43] time for you all to come and save the
[2:48:46] preacher.
[2:48:48] Said you have to walk over God's promise
[2:48:50] in order to get an error
[2:48:53] because there's a red light.
[2:48:56] He said to do you must reject. To do
[2:48:58] this you got to reject the Holy Spirit
[2:49:00] is performing power to accept a creed.
[2:49:04] You have to see the truth before you can
[2:49:05] accept an error. If you're going to be a
[2:49:08] Christian,
[2:49:12] you you have to walk over God's promise
[2:49:15] in order to get an error. Hallelujah.
[2:49:17] Because there's a red light
[2:49:20] flashing before you all the time. This
[2:49:24] is the word. You You didn't just stumble
[2:49:27] into error.
[2:49:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:49:33] &gt;&gt; I smelt somebody else's smoke and wanted
[2:49:36] it. You didn't just stumble into it.
[2:49:41] &gt;&gt; You You had to ignore the flashing red
[2:49:44] light warning of God's word.
[2:49:48] &gt;&gt; You didn't just give your body away
[2:49:49] because somebody else around you was
[2:49:51] doing it.
[2:49:53] If you were God's, if you were God's, if
[2:49:55] you'd had an experience with him, and
[2:49:57] I'm not talking about before you've met
[2:49:59] him in a in a birth. I'm talking about
[2:50:01] after you've known him, there's going to
[2:50:03] be a flashing red light standing in your
[2:50:05] way saying, "Go back to the word. Go
[2:50:07] back to the word. Go back to the word.
[2:50:08] Go back to the word. Go back to the
[2:50:10] word."
[2:50:11] &gt;&gt; And I'd never be able to convince you
[2:50:13] that God was looking over your sin
[2:50:15] because you've seen the flashing red
[2:50:16] light of his word. You understood that,
[2:50:18] didn't you?
[2:50:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "So if Christ is the word,
[2:50:22] every promise is true."
[2:50:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:27] &gt;&gt; Every promise is true. And it's the
[2:50:29] same. yesterday, today, and forever. It
[2:50:32] has to be. It takes a born again faith
[2:50:35] &gt;&gt; to believe it.
[2:50:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:50:37] &gt;&gt; And make it operate.
[2:50:39] &gt;&gt; You You can't just do it with tradition.
[2:50:41] It didn't work. It won't work. You've
[2:50:43] got to come to that blood just as sure
[2:50:47] as anything.
[2:50:53] &gt;&gt; The interesting
[2:50:56] point
[2:51:01] is we're running out of time
[2:51:05] for this transition.
[2:51:08] I didn't get to it today, but there's
[2:51:10] there's some quotations that are
[2:51:12] powerful where he talks about the two
[2:51:14] phases of redemption.
[2:51:17] One part of redemption is bringing you
[2:51:19] out.
[2:51:22] If if if I've ever seen a message that
[2:51:25] brought people out, I can say that
[2:51:27] ministry fulfilled that part of that
[2:51:29] commission to bring us out.
[2:51:34] But he said himself that's only one part
[2:51:36] of redemption.
[2:51:38] He said the other part of redemption is
[2:51:40] to take us in.
[2:51:44] So he's the one that divided the
[2:51:46] commission.
[2:51:50] As I was with Moses, so I will be with
[2:51:53] you. Joshua 1, chapter 1. Read it for
[2:51:57] yourself. 11 powerful verses in there
[2:52:00] where God is promising his his help, his
[2:52:05] strength and stability to Joshua. And
[2:52:08] you can do it and you can make it. And
[2:52:10] you can if you'll stay with the word
[2:52:12] that was brought, you you'll be able to
[2:52:14] go forward and and do. But if if
[2:52:16] redemption has two phases, one is the
[2:52:19] coming out and one is the going in, then
[2:52:21] we need to understand what part is
[2:52:24] behind us and if any is there any part
[2:52:27] ahead of us and I happen to believe
[2:52:28] there is. I happen to believe that we
[2:52:31] have not fully occupied the land of
[2:52:34] promise.
[2:52:35] &gt;&gt; I happen to believe that we're not fully
[2:52:37] walking in our inherited blessing yet.
[2:52:40] &gt;&gt; And I believe the the the holdup and the
[2:52:43] hangup is not on God. It's not on the
[2:52:45] message. I believe it's on you and I.
[2:52:48] &gt;&gt; He told us we've gone as far with God as
[2:52:50] we're ever going to go until we're
[2:52:51] willing to pay a greater price.
[2:52:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:52:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:52:54] &gt;&gt; We don't need armchair prophets. We need
[2:52:56] people who get up and get the job done.
[2:52:58] We don't need people standing back
[2:52:59] telling us what we're not doing, not
[2:53:01] getting it right over here. We need
[2:53:03] people who will come get it right with
[2:53:05] us. You understand? Critics and scornful
[2:53:09] sitting in the seat of the scornful.
[2:53:10] That's not what we're looking for. But
[2:53:12] we're looking for somebody that'll help
[2:53:14] pray, help believe God, help let their
[2:53:17] amen count as we make that as we make
[2:53:20] that turning of the corner and we start
[2:53:23] understanding what it feels like to walk
[2:53:25] in the fullness of our inheritance
[2:53:27] &gt;&gt; where we recognize what's in our mouth.
[2:53:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:53:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:53:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:53:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:53:34] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:53:35] &gt;&gt; It it it's a multiplication.
[2:53:38] &gt;&gt; It's it's a corporate messiah.
[2:53:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm glad to see it
[2:53:43] &gt;&gt; and I'm looking forward
[2:53:45] &gt;&gt; to be it.
[2:53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:53:48] &gt;&gt; You can't pay my price.
[2:53:50] &gt;&gt; I can't pay yours. Somebody said, "I
[2:53:52] thought Christ paid it all." He did. He
[2:53:54] absolutely paid the price to redeem us
[2:53:56] all. It's a greater yes he's looking for
[2:53:59] now. It's a greater surrender he's
[2:54:01] looking for. Are you willing?
[2:54:03] &gt;&gt; Are you willing?
[2:54:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:54:05] &gt;&gt; Two hours on your phone and less than 10
[2:54:07] minutes in prayer. Are you willing?
[2:54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:12] You're keeping up with all your series
[2:54:13] on Netflix. Are you willing?
[2:54:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:54:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "If you be willing and
[2:54:22] obedient,
[2:54:23] you'll eat the good of the land." Let's
[2:54:25] stand together. Let us go up at once to
[2:54:29] take the country,
[2:54:32] to possess the land from Jordan to the
[2:54:35] sea.
[2:54:38] Though the giants all be there, our way
[2:54:42] to hinder,
[2:54:45] our God will surely give the victory.
[2:54:50] Sing it with me. Let us go up at once to
[2:54:54] take the country
[2:54:57] to possess the land from Jordan to the
[2:55:01] sea.
[2:55:03] Though the giants all be there our way
[2:55:08] to hinder,
[2:55:10] our God will surely give the victory.
[2:55:14] [Applause]
[2:55:16] Oh, let us go up at once to take the
[2:55:21] country,
[2:55:23] to possess the land from Jordan to the
[2:55:27] sea.
[2:55:29] And though the giants all be there our
[2:55:33] way to hinder
[2:55:36] our God will surely give victory.
[2:55:43] Let us go up at once to take the country
[2:55:49] to possess the land from Jordan to the
[2:55:53] sea.
[2:55:55] Though the giants all be there, our way
[2:56:00] to hinder.
[2:56:02] Oh, our God will surely give the
[2:56:05] victory. One more time. Oh, let us go up
[2:56:10] at once to take the country. Woo! To
[2:56:15] possess the land from Jordan to the sea.
[2:56:21] Well, the giants all be there.
[2:56:26] [Music]
[2:56:29] Our God will surely give the victory. I
[2:56:33] want to sing it again. Oh, let us go up
[2:56:37] at once to take the country. Think about
[2:56:41] it. To possess the land from Jordan to
[2:56:45] the sea.
[2:56:48] And all the giants all do.
[2:56:52] [Music]
[2:56:53] Woo!
[2:56:55] Our God will surely give.
[2:56:59] Sing it one more time. Oh, let us go up
[2:57:04] at once to take the country
[2:57:08] to possess the land.
[2:57:11] [Music]
[2:57:14] Oh, the giants all be there,
[2:57:20] our God.
[2:57:23] [Music]
[2:57:26] One more time while he comes. Let us go
[2:57:29] up at once to take the country
[2:57:34] to possess the land from Jordan.
[2:57:39] If you know it's yours, you want it.
[2:57:41] Though the giants all be there our way
[2:57:45] to hinder.
[2:57:47] Oh our God will surely give the victory.
[2:57:56] He will
[2:57:58] &gt;&gt; He will
[2:58:01] trust him. He will.
[2:58:10] [Music]
[2:58:16] Upon a hill they called Gatha.
[2:58:23] &gt;&gt; There grew a rose among the weeds.
[2:58:31] A beauty unmbbraced.
[2:58:34] Perfection out of place. Our God the
[2:58:39] King among the thieves.
[2:58:45] It feels like poetry in body.
[2:58:52] The carpenter upon the tree.
[2:58:59] He died against the grain just like he
[2:59:03] lived each day.
[2:59:06] Became the message that he preached. Oh
[2:59:11] hallelu
[2:59:13] [Music]
[2:59:14] with hands lifted high.
[2:59:17] What else would I do
[2:59:21] but give you my heart
[2:59:24] and my hallelu?
[2:59:27] Lord, for all that you've done.
[2:59:31] The least I could do
[2:59:35] is give you my heart
[2:59:38] and my hallelu.
[2:59:45] My hallelujah.

[3:00:01] Cuz he even said how many days
[3:00:08] an earthquake in the cave. That stone
[3:00:12] was rolled away.
[3:00:15] Who puts a god inside a grave?
[3:00:20] Yeah. You can keep God inside a grave.
[3:00:26] Oh, hallelu

[3:01:26] was rolled away.

[3:01:34] Yeah. You can't keep God inside a grave.
[3:01:40] Oh, hallelu.

[3:07:53] Father, our hearts look forward to that
[3:07:56] day, to that moment.
[3:07:59] But until then,
[3:08:01] [Music]
[3:08:02] we need you to fill us
[3:08:05] &gt;&gt; with another installment of your
[3:08:07] resurrection life.
[3:08:10] &gt;&gt; Many of us desire a refilling of the
[3:08:12] Holy Ghost.
[3:08:15] &gt;&gt; We ask today, Lord, that you would help
[3:08:17] us to position our hearts. Oh,
[3:08:23] let the Lord do something. He's here.
[3:08:26] Doesn't matter where you're standing.
[3:08:28] You might be right at the back. You
[3:08:30] might be right at your seat. He's here
[3:08:32] to meet you.
[3:08:35] Just present your need to him. Here we
[3:08:38] are, Lord.
[3:08:40] No place we'd rather be in this moment
[3:08:42] than in your presence.
[3:08:45] Pour your oil on our faith, oh God, that
[3:08:49] we might lift it up higher.
[3:08:51] [Music]
[3:08:54] that these bodies would have to obey the
[3:08:57] confession of your word in our mouths.
[3:09:01] Line up with the creator's program. Line
[3:09:04] up with the creator's plan.
[3:09:08] May every organ, may every system, may
[3:09:10] every cell of these human bodies, may
[3:09:14] they be moved.
[3:09:17] You promised it right in your word. May
[3:09:21] they be moved by the inspiration
[3:09:24] of your word and anointed faith
[3:09:27] [Music]
[3:09:29] to bring wholeness.
[3:09:34] Hallelujah.
[3:09:37] [Music]
[3:09:44] &gt;&gt; Just as a point of contact, would you
[3:09:46] just raise up an antenna? Let's raise up
[3:09:49] a hand to the Lord.
[3:09:51] Lord, you see the need under that hand.
[3:09:55] You see the need.
[3:09:57] It's important to you. It's important to
[3:10:00] you, Jesus. You see the need that's
[3:10:02] represented. Maybe it's huge. Maybe to
[3:10:05] us it's small. But Lord, you look at it
[3:10:07] all the same. Because it touches us, it
[3:10:09] touches you. We're asking for your help
[3:10:12] right now.
[3:10:14] [Music]
[3:10:19] Where direction is needed, Lord, give
[3:10:21] it.
[3:10:22] &gt;&gt; Where questions are, let there be
[3:10:24] answers.
[3:10:26] &gt;&gt; Where bondage is, let freedom come.
[3:10:29] &gt;&gt; Let deliverance come.
[3:10:33] &gt;&gt; May we not spend one more night on this
[3:10:36] side of the Jordan.
[3:10:40] May we cross in faith to possess that
[3:10:45] that you have seized for us.
[3:10:52] May we find the strength and grace to
[3:10:54] dispossess every enemy of the kingdom of
[3:10:57] God that stands between us and our
[3:11:00] inheritance. Every giant that stands
[3:11:03] between us and what you have provided
[3:11:06] for us. May May our courage
[3:11:10] be lifted. Hallelujah.
[3:11:13] May our concern and our care
[3:11:17] be be lifted, be elevated,
[3:11:20] [Music]
[3:11:21] may we take things more serious than
[3:11:24] ever before. As we position our li Oh
[3:11:27] yes. as we position our lives
[3:11:32] for the turning of the corners,
[3:11:34] [Music]
[3:11:35] for the taking of the inheritance,
[3:11:39] for Mark 16 in action in our own lives.
[3:11:42] We don't have any time to judge or
[3:11:43] criticize anybody else. We need it in
[3:11:46] our life.
[3:11:49] &gt;&gt; We worship you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:11:53] Sing it. Hands lifted high.
[3:11:57] What else could I do to give you my give
[3:12:02] you my heart?
[3:12:04] My hallelujah
[3:12:08] for all that you've done.
[3:12:12] &gt;&gt; The least I could do.
[3:12:15] &gt;&gt; Give you my heart.

[3:12:37] &gt;&gt; I'm not holding anything back. I'm
[3:12:39] giving it all over to you.
[3:12:41] &gt;&gt; I believe in you for the freedom.
[3:12:43] &gt;&gt; I give you my heart.
[3:12:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:12:47] &gt;&gt; My hallelujah,
[3:12:50] Lord, for all that you've done.
[3:12:54] The least I could do, the Lord is give
[3:12:58] you my heart
[3:13:00] and my hallelujah.
[3:13:06] What a lamb. My hallelujah.
[3:13:11] [Music]
[3:13:16] One more time. Hallelujah. With hands
[3:13:18] lifted high. Oh hallelu
[3:13:23] with hands lifted high.
[3:13:27] What else would I do
[3:13:29] &gt;&gt; to give you my heart
[3:13:30] &gt;&gt; but give you my heart
[3:13:34] and my hallelu
[3:13:38] Lord for all that you've done.
[3:13:41] &gt;&gt; I praise you for that. The least I could
[3:13:43] do
[3:13:45] is give you my heart.
[3:13:49] My hallelujah.
[3:13:55] Just remember, not just on Sunday.
[3:13:59] Give him your hallelujah tomorrow.
[3:14:02] &gt;&gt; Give him your hallelujah Tuesday and
[3:14:04] Wednesday and Thursday, Friday, wherever
[3:14:06] you are.
[3:14:08] &gt;&gt; Keep giving it to him. Amen.
[3:14:10] &gt;&gt; Give him Give him your day. Give him
[3:14:12] your life. Give him some time.
[3:14:15] &gt;&gt; Open the Bible.
[3:14:18] &gt;&gt; Hear a tape.
[3:14:19] &gt;&gt; Spend some time in prayer.
[3:14:23] &gt;&gt; Preparation precedes a blessing.
[3:14:26] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe that?
[3:14:28] &gt;&gt; Let's have Nathan and Shosana to come.
[3:14:31] Let's lay hands on her and anoint her
[3:14:33] with oil. As her due date is drawing
[3:14:36] near,
[3:14:38] they ask that we would pray for them as
[3:14:40] they
[3:14:42] prepare to
[3:14:44] give sweet Edith
[3:14:48] somebody else to love and help take care
[3:14:50] of. Amen.
[3:14:55] Things were a little difficult
[3:14:58] last time and our faith is believing for
[3:15:03] redemption, restoration,
[3:15:06] completion, fullness,
[3:15:09] grace.
[3:15:12] May it just uh
[3:15:15] may it be just so in line with God's
[3:15:17] intention
[3:15:21] because there's so many spiritual things
[3:15:23] birthing.
[3:15:26] May it just be with
[3:15:28] great ease.
[3:15:31] Let the room be filled with the angels
[3:15:34] of the Lord.
[3:15:41] &gt;&gt; Great cooperation.
[3:15:44] Pray for the midwife. And we
[3:15:52] Thank you Jesus.
[3:15:55] [Music]
[3:16:04] Reach your hands this way and you
[3:16:06] sisters want to come closer and brothers
[3:16:08] come to Nathan and
[3:16:14] Hallelujah.
[3:16:18] Lord, we anoint our sister in the
[3:16:21] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[3:16:24] And Father, we thank you that you have
[3:16:26] created this body,
[3:16:30] Lord, to deliver, to give life, to bring
[3:16:33] it forth.
[3:16:35] We thank you for the miracle.
[3:16:39] We see it as a great, beautiful miracle,
[3:16:44] a part of your plan. So there's no
[3:16:47] reason why it has to be such a
[3:16:51] complication or even anxiety or stress.
[3:16:55] This is your plan for their family. You
[3:16:58] are expanding and increasing their
[3:17:01] family according to your perfect divine
[3:17:04] will.
[3:17:06] So we ask right now that every part of
[3:17:08] her body, every part of her tripartate
[3:17:13] being would just line right up.
[3:17:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:17:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every system of her body
[3:17:21] function as the Lord has created it to
[3:17:25] function. May there be great grace.
[3:17:28] &gt;&gt; May there be unbelievable peace in the
[3:17:30] room. Lord Jesus,
[3:17:34] thank you for the angels who will gather
[3:17:37] near them. And
[3:17:40] we thank you for helping the midwife in
[3:17:42] every way.
[3:17:45] Give her wisdom and sensitivity, Lord,
[3:17:47] even to things she might not understand.
[3:17:50] But Lord, uh, show her your power. Show
[3:17:54] her your great grace.
[3:18:03] Glory father for Nathan. We pray
[3:18:07] &gt;&gt; that he would be able to have the
[3:18:09] strength of the Lord in the perfect
[3:18:13] peace and faith that's necessary
[3:18:16] to help create the right environment in
[3:18:19] that room and in that home. and may they
[3:18:22] just work together beautifully together
[3:18:25] in unison as you bring forth this life.
[3:18:29] May there be no fear. We we know that
[3:18:32] even a by human nature fear likes to
[3:18:35] arise. But we pray right now that there
[3:18:38] would be no fear that it would just be
[3:18:40] this is the Lord's doing. It's beautiful
[3:18:42] in our eyes and we thank you for his
[3:18:45] peace.
[3:18:46] Bless Edith, Lord, in every transition
[3:18:49] of her life and every part, this
[3:18:52] beautiful new addition to their family,
[3:18:55] Lord. Just help her to be the best
[3:18:58] big sister ever.
[3:19:01] Glory be to Jesus.
[3:19:04] Glory be to Jesus.
[3:19:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:19:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[3:19:16] Thank you for wonderful peace.

[3:19:25] &gt;&gt; Maybe your sister just want to greet her
[3:19:26] and you brothers. Greet
[3:19:29] brother Nathan.
[3:19:35] Love you.
[3:19:38] Can I greet you?
[3:19:42] Hallelujah.
[3:19:45] Who else has a someone else have a need
[3:19:48] here? Let's pray for Sister Alfreda
[3:19:53] carrying a great burden in her heart and
[3:19:57] leaving on Thursday to go to Edmonton to
[3:20:01] be there with her sister who's needing
[3:20:04] extra care these days with the battle
[3:20:06] that she's fighting,
[3:20:09] 90 years old and
[3:20:12] and fighting. But God is a a good God.
[3:20:15] He's a great God.
[3:20:17] &gt;&gt; He knows the time of our birth. He knows
[3:20:20] the time of our departure.
[3:20:22] &gt;&gt; It's all in his hands. And we we thank
[3:20:25] him for that.
[3:20:26] &gt;&gt; But Sister Alfredo will need of course
[3:20:28] the strength and grace of the Lord
[3:20:31] &gt;&gt; to to be able physically physically
[3:20:33] she'll need his help
[3:20:35] &gt;&gt; and spiritually, emotionally as well.
[3:20:37] Father, in the name of Jesus, we pray
[3:20:40] for our precious sister. Lord, whose
[3:20:42] heart would be very heavy at a time like
[3:20:44] this,
[3:20:46] &gt;&gt; just arriving home and and having to go
[3:20:49] back a little quicker than anticipated.
[3:20:52] &gt;&gt; But Lord, we thank you. I know that she
[3:20:54] will bring a lot of peace
[3:20:56] &gt;&gt; and a lot of comfort and a lot of
[3:20:58] strength to our sister Lydia.
[3:21:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, we believe with every fiber of our
[3:21:03] being that you're still the healer, that
[3:21:06] you're still the creator. Yes.
[3:21:08] &gt;&gt; We don't know exactly what your heart is
[3:21:10] in this matter, but we know Lord
[3:21:13] &gt;&gt; that you will be with them every step of
[3:21:16] the way.
[3:21:17] &gt;&gt; You will provide all that is needed,
[3:21:20] Lord.
[3:21:22] &gt;&gt; Father, go with her with great grace.
[3:21:24] Angels along the way. It's a long way to
[3:21:27] travel,
[3:21:28] &gt;&gt; but Lord, we just believe your plan is
[3:21:30] unfolding
[3:21:35] &gt;&gt; for such a time as this. Jesus,
[3:21:40] &gt;&gt; thank you.
