TRANSCRIPT
========================================
He was formed from a divine holy intervention, but given flesh that would feel, that would have emotion, &gt;&gt; that would experience ups and downs. &gt;&gt; Why? So that he could be a high priest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that he could be touched &gt;&gt; with the feeling of our infirmities. so that he can know what it's like to live as a man. &gt;&gt; What love. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "What love." &gt;&gt; What amazing love. &gt;&gt; He didn't have to do it that way. He chose to do it that way. &gt;&gt; It is not a lesser administration. It is not a lesser office. &gt;&gt; Right there. &gt;&gt; Not not a lesser manifestation. This is God, &gt;&gt; eternal, &gt;&gt; once invisible, &gt;&gt; now incarnate, &gt;&gt; in a body. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's important to know that because if you don't fully understand that, you'll think that any baptism works and that any baptism is right and that any baptism is Christian. But when the father decided, I'm going to find a name. I'm going to get a name. I'm going to have a name. In fact, the New Testament says that the father gave him a name. &gt;&gt; At that name, every knee, &gt;&gt; help me just a little bit. &gt;&gt; Every knee will bow and every tongue will confess. Salvation comes in no other way, in no other form, by no other name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Than that precious name in English, we would say of the Lord Jesus Christ. When you're baptized in that name, you're not leaving Father out. You're not leaving Holy Spirit out. You're attaching yourself to a name that was so high, so chosen, so exalted that it was large enough &gt;&gt; to be worn by the one that the scripture said &gt;&gt; in him &gt;&gt; dwelt. Help me &gt;&gt; dwelt. One part of God, one office of God, &gt;&gt; one administration of God, &gt;&gt; all &gt;&gt; in him dwelt all &gt;&gt; the fullness, &gt;&gt; the fullness &gt;&gt; of the Godhead. &gt;&gt; Amen. All the offices, &gt;&gt; all of the attributes, &gt;&gt; all the redemptive names and descriptive titles, &gt;&gt; all of them, &gt;&gt; dwelt in him. The scripture said the fullness of God &gt;&gt; dwelt in him. How &gt;&gt; bodily. &gt;&gt; So now you've got Jehovah Rafa. &gt;&gt; You've got Jehovah Shama. &gt;&gt; You You've got all of that &gt;&gt; now covered under one name. But Jesus didn't say, "I'll send you the third person." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He said, "I &gt;&gt; will." &gt;&gt; You won't stay comfortless &gt;&gt; for long, &gt;&gt; because I will &gt;&gt; come to you. &gt;&gt; How is it possible? I I'm going to leave, but I'll come again. He was going to change bodies. &gt;&gt; He had accomplished what needed to be accomplished in that earthly body for now of our Lord Jesus Christ. The body went into the ground. He was resurrected as a as a glorified Christ &gt;&gt; like John saw him in Revelation chapter one. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But the spirit that was in him &gt;&gt; Yes. was now going to fall on 120 gathered in the upper room. &gt;&gt; And even though it greatly offends people, I take great delight in saying it as often as possible that the enemy now he no longer had to deal with one Jesus. &gt;&gt; I know what the religious mind says. This is blasphemy. &gt;&gt; There's only one Jesus. &gt;&gt; But you you don't understand. The father had a bigger plan than that from the beginning. Right. &gt;&gt; He He didn't just want one house. &gt;&gt; He wanted a house with lots of rooms. &gt;&gt; He wanted a house with lots of places &gt;&gt; that he could dwell &gt;&gt; and not just to put you on a shelf like a trophy. &gt;&gt; But so that in the last of the last &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. at the end of the end times, &gt;&gt; he could not only live in us and dwell in us as as as his purchased possession, but that he could move through us &gt;&gt; in a quick short work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Unlike the world has ever seen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A final harvest.
