[0:05] foreign
[0:06] I recognize that on occasion our Eternal
[0:11] uh part that part that is not of this
[0:14] world that eternal life that you and I
[0:17] carry by the new birth it squeezes out
[0:20] through the cracks sometimes
[0:23] and people begin to see that there is
[0:26] something that is not religion there is
[0:29] something that is reality how many of
[0:32] you want to be so filled with eternity
[0:34] that everywhere you go
[0:36] eternity just oozes out of the pores of
[0:39] your skin and somebody says I want what
[0:42] you've got
[0:44] we live this life as an offering unto
[0:48] God who has been so good to us I'm
[0:51] telling you the goodness of God keeps
[0:54] chasing you and I down can anybody say
[0:57] Amen he's after you he wants to bless
[1:01] you he wants to fill you with who he is
[1:05] he wants to so fill you
[1:07] that those around you in line at the
[1:11] restaurant
[1:13] if you're brave enough to go to Walmart
[1:18] wherever you go God wants to let that
[1:22] light shine out of you in such a way
[1:24] that's part of the glorification that
[1:27] that caps off our Redemption what we're
[1:30] talking about here is something higher
[1:31] than what you can accomplish out of your
[1:34] own ambition this is God filling you so
[1:36] full of who he is
[1:38] that you can hardly help yourself
[1:40] it just comes out of your mouth it comes
[1:43] out of your language your vocabulary is
[1:45] influenced by eternity and the way you
[1:48] live the way you the way you choose your
[1:51] to pay your bills the way you conduct
[1:53] your business
[1:55] testifies if there's a living God who
[1:58] lives inside of you being glorified as a
[2:02] fifth part of the plan five steps of
[2:05] redemption that doesn't mean going to
[2:07] heaven
[2:08] God's not talking to us in this
[2:10] scripture in Romans the Apostle Paul is
[2:14] not talking about going to heaven he's
[2:16] talking about something he wants to do
[2:17] for us now
[2:19] it's speaking about us receiving a
[2:22] revelation of his glory that works in US
[2:26] Christ in you
[2:29] what's the rest of that
[2:31] the hope of glory it's that portion of
[2:36] his glory it's the hope of his glory
[2:38] that's working on the inside of you and
[2:41] that's what we're after we're after
[2:43] Christ
[2:44] that we might win him we're not working
[2:46] this life for a for a mansion somewhere
[2:50] we're not working this life so that we
[2:52] can walk on golden streets and have a
[2:55] mansion and and see all the beauty all
[2:57] these things are beautiful to think
[2:59] about and Heaven is a lovely place but
[3:01] you know we're not working for heaven
[3:04] we're doing what we do and living what
[3:06] we live because we want to be a light
[3:08] and we want to be a testimony
[3:10] of the hope of Christ that lies within
[3:13] us the glory is working in US internally
[3:18] to position us to a place where we can
[3:21] fully step into everything written about
[3:23] us
[3:24] in the books
[3:26] you got to have it all
[3:28] there's a part of you that cannot
[3:30] surrender to God's full plan that he has
[3:34] written about you in the books of Heaven
[3:35] until that Glory starts shining in you
[3:37] and on you and through you and you start
[3:40] experiencing a true change one that is
[3:43] not about getting a good blessing in
[3:45] church one that is about going outside
[3:47] of the Four Walls of this church and
[3:49] living a new life we can call this stage
[3:53] of redemption this glorification stage
[3:57] we can call it a point of convergence
[4:01] because everything that God was doing
[4:03] for us up to this point it starts
[4:06] weaving together in a place of
[4:09] convergence to propel us how many of you
[4:13] know that means to push us forward into
[4:16] completing his Destiny plan for our life
