[0:50] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[0:53] Shelley and you're watching the Eagles
[0:55] cry I want to welcome you to the program
[0:57] today and I believe that the Lord is
[1:00] going to speak to you from his word
[1:03] that's how much he loves you he wants to
[1:05] encourage you he wants to give you
[1:07] instruction and leadership and he just
[1:10] wants to love on you through his word
[1:12] you know sometimes we feel in this life
[1:16] unloved things can happen relationships
[1:19] can be broken and we can fight rejection
[1:22] and we can feel very very unloved and
[1:25] that's evermore the reason why we need
[1:28] to draw very very close to our Heavenly
[1:30] Father because he wants to shower us
[1:32] with his love and there's nothing
[1:35] there's no love in this world that that
[1:38] is as fulfilling as the love of God and
[1:41] I believe the Lord wants to show you his
[1:43] love today and I appreciate you watching
[1:46] this program and if you've not taken the
[1:48] time to contact us at the New Hope
[1:50] revival ministries I'd like for you to
[1:54] do that let us know that you're watching
[1:56] the program and if it's been a blessing
[1:57] to you and all the information of how to
[2:01] contact us is given to you now on the
[2:03] screen and we'd like for you to visit
[2:05] our ministry website as well and take a
[2:09] look at some of the things that we have
[2:10] available there I know that there are
[2:13] good resources there that will
[2:15] strengthen you on your Christian journey
[2:16] and I also want to thank God for the
[2:20] wonderful networks beautiful Christian
[2:22] networks that we have the privilege of
[2:25] being on you're watching this program on
[2:29] one of those networks and we pray for
[2:31] them every day that God will supply the
[2:33] need that he will always bless and
[2:37] strengthen the staff and the leadership
[2:39] of those networks that they will not
[2:42] only be maintained but that they will
[2:45] grow and reach more lives with the good
[2:48] news of the kingdom of the Lord Jesus
[2:51] Christ
[2:52] let's look to the Word of God we're
[2:53] going right back to where we started
[2:55] last week we're going right back to
[2:58] Romans chapter 8 let's look there now
[3:01] romans chapter 8 and we were beginning
[3:04] in verse 14 for as many as are led by
[3:08] the Spirit of God they are the sons of
[3:12] God and this is where we sort of backed
[3:15] up and left you last program for ye have
[3:18] not received the spirit of bondage again
[3:21] to fear but you have received the spirit
[3:24] of adoption and that's what this series
[3:28] is about the spiritual process of
[3:31] adoption or the process of spiritual
[3:35] adoption but ye have received the spirit
[3:38] of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father
[3:42] and I was talking to you about being in
[3:46] the Jewish market in Jerusalem and
[3:48] perhaps a little boy or a little girl
[3:51] has become separated from their father
[3:54] it can also be their mother and if it
[3:57] was the mother you'd hear a little sweet
[4:00] voice crying Emma Emma but if it was the
[4:04] father that they were separated from you
[4:06] would hear a sweet little voice saying
[4:08] of ABBA
[4:10] and this you know I think the last thing
[4:14] I was saying is I have four children of
[4:16] my own and we had two boys first and
[4:20] then we had two girls and my oldest son
[4:23] will be 11 this year and our little baby
[4:28] girl will turn 3 she's 2 now and will
[4:32] turn 3 and so the other two are in
[4:35] between 8 going on 9 and 4 going on 5
[4:38] and and so forth but these two little
[4:42] girls came along and they have a way you
[4:46] know there's something about girls they
[4:48] have a way of turning daddy's heart and
[4:51] I mean they could say to me father I
[4:54] need something and and that would be ok
[4:57] but there's something about when these
[4:59] little sweet girls in their little
[5:01] Southern drawl say daddy daddy and I'm
[5:07] telling you when they say that that
[5:09] touches my heart and I would give them
[5:11] anything in my power and they know that
[5:13] and their mother
[5:15] gets onto me sometime because they use
[5:17] that tender little term of endearment to
[5:20] really touch my heart and it is it's
[5:24] almost foreign to many of us as
[5:27] Christian believers to understand that
[5:31] God wants us to have that kind of
[5:36] relationship with him whereby we can cry
[5:40] out to him Abba Father
[5:43] Papa God can you imagine that the god of
[5:48] the universe the one who spoke
[5:51] everything we know into existence
[5:55] created the heavens and the earth
[5:57] created the stars in the universe and
[6:00] put every planet in its orbit who
[6:03] created the Sun and the moon and one of
[6:07] the prophets of the Old Testament
[6:08] describes some of the works of the
[6:11] creation of God and you know he placed
[6:14] his hand on the earth and the mountains
[6:17] seemed to rise up between his fingers
[6:19] and one writer said he spat and the
[6:22] oceans appeared we're talking about a
[6:25] vast God that that it's hard for us to
[6:30] to see that God as our papa as someone
[6:35] who wants to pull us up to himself and
[6:38] put his arm around us and say it's gonna
[6:41] be alright it's going to be alright I've
[6:44] had to do that sometime for my little
[6:46] girls maybe their feelings were hurt
[6:47] someone didn't want to play with them
[6:50] when they wanted to play and their
[6:52] feelings were hurt and I've had to draw
[6:54] them up on my knee and say it's going to
[6:56] be all right maybe in my house their
[6:59] brothers locked them out of the bedroom
[7:00] or something and they couldn't go in and
[7:02] play with him for a little while and
[7:04] they would come crying and I'll pick
[7:07] them up and kiss them and say it's going
[7:09] to be alright and it's hard for us to
[7:12] imagine that God wants to do that for us
[7:15] that's why this adoption the spiritual
[7:19] adoption is so important and that's why
[7:23] the theme of the Holy Spirit in this
[7:25] hour has been relationship and I think
[7:28] we
[7:29] did a good job on the last program
[7:30] covering the the fact that religion is
[7:35] unfulfilled it's not enough you can
[7:38] follow all the rules you can go to
[7:40] church three four or five times a week
[7:42] you can fast you can give your tithe you
[7:45] can shake the preachers hand you can
[7:47] work in the nursery and sing in the
[7:49] choir and take up the offering you could
[7:52] be an usher you can lead the worship or
[7:54] play an instrument and still not be
[7:57] fulfilled not have that real place of
[8:02] Revelation of his love and that intimate
[8:06] fellowship with him but I'm telling you
[8:09] now is the time this is the season where
[8:13] God wants to make that kind of
[8:16] relationship a revelation to you and a
[8:20] reality in your life
[8:22] so we have not received this the bondage
[8:26] that is brought to us by the spirit of
[8:28] fear perfect love casteth out fear but
[8:32] we have received in the place of fear we
[8:36] have received the spirit of adoption now
[8:39] I believe in the fear of the Lord and I
[8:41] believe we need to approach God in what
[8:44] is called reverential fear reverence
[8:48] respect and honor because he is God and
[8:52] we are not but he doesn't want us
[8:54] fearing his wrath and judgment if we're
[8:57] children of God he wants us to know that
[9:00] he would rather his his preferred mode
[9:05] of correction is in love now we talked
[9:10] about last time he will correct us he
[9:14] will take us to the woodshed I don't
[9:16] know if you know what that means in your
[9:17] part of the world but many years ago if
[9:20] if if a boy was acting up his daddy
[9:23] would say meet me at the woodshed and
[9:25] that meant he was going to get he was
[9:27] going to get some corporal punishment he
[9:29] was going to have some you know some
[9:33] physical connection with his dad and God
[9:37] has taken me to the woodshed I have I've
[9:41] been whipped
[9:42] by God I've been put in some hard places
[9:46] but I know at the end and remember I I
[9:50] think I mentioned the scripture about if
[9:52] God loves you he will chasten you and if
[9:54] he chastens you not your illegitimate
[9:56] your none of his but the Bible also said
[10:00] that no chastisement seemeth good in
[10:04] that moment in that season it doesn't
[10:07] feel very good when you know that you've
[10:09] disappointed the Lord it doesn't feel
[10:12] very good when you know that you've
[10:13] failed God it's a hard time in your life
[10:18] it doesn't feel good at the moment but
[10:20] then when it's over and you begin to
[10:23] recognize what was that about
[10:25] that was about grace that wasn't about
[10:28] judgment that was about love divine love
[10:32] and favor he loves you so much that he
[10:37] wants you to be what he would have you
[10:40] to be and he wants to give you the Grace
[10:42] and the strength and the power to be
[10:44] that and what is it that God wants us to
[10:47] be spiritual sons he wants us to come to
[10:50] that place of spiritual adoption verse
[10:56] 16 Romans 8 the spirit itself beareth
[10:58] witness with our spirit that we are the
[11:01] children of God and that's that spirit
[11:03] to spirit fellowship and I'm telling you
[11:05] there's nothing like it there's there's
[11:08] no words to describe it and there's no
[11:10] substitute for it
[11:12] fellowshipping the divine presence of
[11:15] God and somebody said well how is that
[11:19] accomplished well I'll tell you there
[11:21] are many ways but the most simple way of
[11:24] coming into spirit to spirit fellowship
[11:27] with God is through praise and worship
[11:29] by by magnifying the Lord with the fruit
[11:34] of your lips by singing to him a song
[11:38] that's to him it's exclusively about him
[11:42] it's not about you it's not about your
[11:45] experience it's not about your reaction
[11:47] to him it's all about him and we sing a
[11:52] song at our church that says it's not
[11:54] about me it's all
[11:56] about you god it's not about me as if
[11:59] you should do things my way it's about
[12:02] you and and God wants us to come into
[12:05] that but that's reverential fear that's
[12:07] the fear of the Lord to say it's not me
[12:09] it's not about me it's not what I want
[12:12] it's what you want and you know there
[12:14] are stages in our life where it's
[12:17] possible that we would resent that that
[12:19] we're not in control but if you can keep
[12:23] walking through those stages and letting
[12:26] the love of God help you soften your
[12:29] spirit and let the Word of God speak to
[12:31] you you'll come out of that I've been
[12:33] there I've been in those places where
[12:35] you think I can't even make a decision
[12:37] for myself and all that you have to do
[12:41] to fix that is to make a bad decision
[12:43] for God to stand back and say okay you
[12:46] do it you try it and then you make one
[12:48] on your own without his help and you
[12:50] fall flat on your face and then you'll
[12:53] be like me and you'll come running back
[12:54] to God and say I don't like it when I
[12:56] have to make the decision I'd rather you
[12:59] lead me I'd rather you guide me and to
[13:01] think about the fact that this this
[13:04] mighty God this awesome God that we just
[13:07] described the creator of heaven and
[13:09] earth wants to be concerned about my
[13:13] little puny life and the little details
[13:17] of my life and where I should go and
[13:20] when I should stay and and what I should
[13:23] say and who I should speak to and where
[13:25] I should be at any given moment to think
[13:28] that God would really care and people
[13:30] still wonder does God really care about
[13:33] all the little minor minut details of my
[13:35] life he does he cares I'll tell you how
[13:38] much he cares he cares so much that he
[13:41] came down from heaven in the form of a
[13:44] man in a son God Almighty became flesh
[13:48] and dwelt among us so that he could
[13:52] understand what it is like to live on
[13:56] the human side of things and yet he was
[13:59] tempted in all manner as we are the
[14:01] Bible said yet there was no sin found in
[14:04] him he went to the cross and paid the
[14:07] price with his own blood
[14:09] rose again from the dead on the third
[14:11] day poured himself out on the day of
[14:14] Pentecost as an earnest of the fullness
[14:17] of what was to come
[14:18] that's how much he cares about them I
[14:20] knew details of your life he paid the
[14:23] ultimate price so that you could come
[14:26] into that place of relationship with him
[14:28] and be led in all things I tell you if
[14:31] you didn't love God before that ought to
[14:33] make you love him that ought to make you
[14:35] want to serve Him
[14:36] that ought to make you want to surrender
[14:37] your life to him and let me just say
[14:40] this there are not there not many gods
[14:42] there's one God one God there's only one
[14:47] and there are not many ways to God
[14:50] people will tell you all religions lead
[14:53] to the same God that is a lie from the
[14:56] pit of hell
[14:57] all religions do not lead to the same
[15:00] God there's only one way to have access
[15:04] to God I don't want to offend you but
[15:07] neither do I want to leave you with a
[15:09] misunderstanding I want to speak clearly
[15:12] to you so that you will know Jesus
[15:14] Christ Yeshua the Messiah said I am the
[15:18] way was he just boasting was he just
[15:21] bragging was that a prideful statement
[15:24] no it was an invitation for eternal life
[15:28] I am the way the truth and the life no
[15:31] man cometh unto the father but by me
[15:34] Jesus Christ Yeshua the Messiah is the
[15:38] door whereby we enter to have fellowship
[15:42] with Almighty God and so I want you to
[15:46] examine where you are I want you to
[15:49] examine your belief system I want to ask
[15:52] I want you to ask yourself today have
[15:55] you accepted religion but rejected
[15:58] relationship
[15:59] have you chosen religion over
[16:03] relationship rules and regulations and
[16:07] doing good deeds which is very important
[16:09] because faith without works is dead
[16:11] don't tell me that God doesn't care
[16:13] about our works he does faith without
[16:16] works is dead faith is demonstrated by
[16:19] good works but good works that's not
[16:22] enough
[16:23] it takes the grace of God it takes a
[16:26] real place of intimacy and relationship
[16:29] with him I could go on about that all
[16:32] day but I don't have all day to do it so
[16:35] I have to move on verse 16 the spirit
[16:38] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[16:41] there it is again his spirit confirming
[16:45] in our spirit bearing witness in our
[16:48] spirit that we are the children of God
[16:53] that's safe that's a safe place to be
[16:57] children of the Most High God and it
[17:01] gets better than that and if children
[17:04] then heirs heirs of God those who have a
[17:10] legal claim on the inheritance that
[17:14] comes from God that's what an heir is
[17:16] and joint heirs with Christ with Messiah
[17:21] with Messiah we are joint heirs he is
[17:27] our elder brother imagine that if so be
[17:32] that we suffer with him and I'm not
[17:35] going to sit here and tell you that
[17:37] there's not suffering in the Christian
[17:40] journey because some of you are watching
[17:41] me in places where you may be greatly
[17:45] persecuted for your relationship with
[17:48] Jesus Christ maybe you know someone who
[17:52] has faced death or has been killed
[17:55] because of the testimony of Jesus Christ
[17:58] I can't promise you that you'll not be
[18:02] faced with that same set of
[18:04] circumstances because there are
[18:06] sufferings those of us who may not be
[18:09] our lives may not be threatened we also
[18:13] suffer with other other ways may be
[18:16] easier ways but nonetheless suffering
[18:19] rejection and persecution
[18:22] misunderstanding malice and slander and
[18:24] those who would like to see us destroyed
[18:27] but if we have fellowship with him in
[18:31] his sufferings if
[18:35] Oh be that we suffer with him we may be
[18:40] also glorified together when he comes
[18:46] into the fullness of his glory you're
[18:48] coming in to the fullness of his glory
[18:50] with him that is good news very good
[18:56] news for I reckon verse 18 for I reckon
[19:01] that the sufferings of this present time
[19:03] whatever you're going through right now
[19:05] may look dark it may look bleak it may
[19:08] look ugly it may be painful but the
[19:11] Apostle said I reckon that the
[19:14] sufferings of this present time are not
[19:16] worthy to be compared with the glory
[19:19] which shall be revealed now notice it
[19:24] doesn't say the glory that shall be
[19:27] revealed to us that's good that would be
[19:31] good enough that God would reveal his
[19:35] glory before us or to us that we might
[19:37] see that we might behold his glory but
[19:42] that's not what the verse said the verse
[19:44] says that we may be glorified together
[19:48] that the glory shall be revealed in us
[19:56] in us the glory of God revealed in us
[20:02] manifesting through us to a world that's
[20:06] lost and needy without God who can only
[20:11] see God through others and we are the
[20:15] others that the promise is given to if
[20:18] we are willing to participate with him
[20:21] in his suffering that his glory shall be
[20:23] revealed in us and no matter what you're
[20:25] going through now the Apostle said it's
[20:28] not even worthy to be compared if you if
[20:30] you measured it out sufferings glory
[20:33] sufferings glory sufferings the glory
[20:36] that's going to be revealed every time
[20:38] the glory would be heavier the
[20:40] sufferings would be lighter there's no
[20:42] comparison between the two verse 19 for
[20:46] the earnest
[20:48] expectation of the creature
[20:51] I'm the creature he's the Creator
[20:55] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[20:59] sons of God here we are this is a
[21:04] genderless revelation it's not male or
[21:07] female it's not that women can be the
[21:10] Bride of Christ and men are the sons of
[21:12] God that's not how it is it's genderless
[21:14] both men and women can enter into that
[21:18] place of of the bridal expression and
[21:22] men and women can come into this place
[21:24] of being the sons of God and all of
[21:28] creation is groaning verse 24 the
[21:32] creature was made subject to vanity not
[21:35] willingly but by reason of him who has
[21:38] subjected the same in Hope because the
[21:42] creature also shall be delivered from
[21:46] the bondage of corruption into the
[21:49] glorious liberty of the children of God
[21:54] there is a glorious deliverance that is
[21:58] coming to the people of God where we
[22:02] have been limited
[22:04] we've been limited by this body that
[22:09] we're living in but we're coming to a
[22:12] time and I don't I won't go too deeply
[22:15] into this but for you that have an ear
[22:18] perhaps you will hear it we're coming
[22:21] into a time as the sons of God are
[22:24] manifested as we enter into that
[22:27] relationship of full adoption we're
[22:30] coming to a place where we will not be
[22:32] limited by this creature by this fleshly
[22:36] body that has been subjected to vanity
[22:38] but we're going to come into a place of
[22:42] deliverance from the corruption of the
[22:46] body into the glorious liberty of the
[22:50] children of God I want to say not only
[22:52] the corruption because that's the
[22:54] ultimate effect of death is corruption
[22:56] and we know that the Bible said that
[22:59] mortality will put on immortality and
[23:02] corruption will put on incorruption this
[23:04] is talking about the resurrection the
[23:06] potential for resurrection but there's
[23:09] something else here we're not just going
[23:11] to be delivered from the corruption of
[23:13] this body into the glorious liberty
[23:16] we're going to be delivered from the
[23:18] restraint we're going to be delivered
[23:22] from the limitations of this body into
[23:25] the glorious liberty of the children of
[23:28] God there is a supernatural realm that
[23:33] supersedes the natural realm what is
[23:37] happening right now in the spirit realm
[23:39] is more real than what's happening right
[23:43] now in the natural realm sometimes we
[23:46] watch the news or we see the newspaper
[23:49] and we think oh things are so terrible
[23:52] in the world and and let me tell you
[23:55] something it there there are some
[23:57] terrible things going on in the world no
[23:59] doubt about that fear on every hand the
[24:01] Bible said it's going to get worse men's
[24:04] hearts are gonna fail them for fear
[24:06] because iniquity shall abound the love
[24:08] of many shall wax cold we're going to
[24:12] see some serious things but if your
[24:14] spiritual eyes could be opened you would
[24:17] see into that spirit realm into that
[24:19] supernatural dimension and you would
[24:22] recognize that with every challenge that
[24:25] the enemy is is bringing forth proposing
[24:30] in this hour every challenge that the
[24:33] enemy is proposing in the world in this
[24:34] hour in the spirit realm God is giving
[24:39] attention to that in other words angels
[24:41] and spirit angels and heavenly beings
[24:47] are being dispatched and organized and
[24:51] prepared to deal with everything that
[24:55] the enemy is proposing on planet earth
[24:58] and that realm over there although not
[25:01] as easily seen as the natural realm not
[25:04] as easily discerned as the realm you're
[25:07] living in right now it's more real and
[25:09] there's actually more activity going on
[25:12] over there in the spirit realm than
[25:14] there is in the natural
[25:15] right now so God's got it covered let me
[25:18] just tell you that God's got it covered
[25:20] and if you don't know that then you're
[25:23] like a haze I you're like the you're
[25:25] like the servant to the Prophet and he
[25:28] got really worried he got really
[25:30] concerned and he couldn't see what was
[25:33] going on and when when the Prophet
[25:35] looked out across the mountains he
[25:37] didn't see the enemy he saw angels in
[25:40] chariots he saw reinforcements in that
[25:43] spirit realm that were coming down to
[25:45] take care of the battle that was about
[25:47] to take place in the earthly realm the
[25:49] devil can't do anything in this earthly
[25:52] realm that God doesn't already it's not
[25:54] already preparing for it let me tell you
[25:57] something God knows he is omniscient he
[26:01] has all knowledge and he knows what's
[26:04] going on and he knows what the enemy is
[26:06] doing and he knows what the enemy is
[26:08] about to do and in the spirit realm he's
[26:11] already making preparation to meet the
[26:13] challenge of the enemy the prophet of
[26:16] God prayed over his servant and he said
[26:18] Lord open his eyes and his eyes were
[26:22] open to that realm and he saw and this
[26:26] was his testimony there are more for us
[26:28] than against this hallelujah I pray that
[26:32] God will open your eyes and he'll let
[26:35] you see that no matter how dark how
[26:37] bleak how ugly it looks there are more
[26:41] for us than against us and God is
[26:45] already making preparation in that other
[26:47] realm to take care of any challenge any
[26:50] threat any trick that the enemy has I
[26:54] have to pray but I'm feeling the
[26:56] anointing I feel like God wanted you to
[26:59] hear that I feel like God wanted you to
[27:01] know that yeah there's some perilous
[27:03] times there are some troublesome times
[27:05] on this planet right now that will only
[27:07] get worse but God's got it covered
[27:09] brother he knows what's going on and
[27:11] he's going to take care of those who are
[27:14] hiding in the rock of ages' let's pray
