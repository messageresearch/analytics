TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i believe that the most high rules in the kingdom of men i cannot get my mind around a god and i certainly cannot give my life i cannot forgive me for being so bold i cannot give my life to a god that's powerless against his own enemy i cannot give my life to a god that a democrat can fool or or a voting machine can cheat or that a bunch of people can steal and god doesn't have any power to do anything about it i cannot because my scripture tells me the word tells me the most high not only rules in the kingdom of eternity the kingdom of light the kingdom of god but he also has rule in the kingdom of man and guess how he brings that up to pass he uses men he puts evil intent he puts evil intent in men's hearts and causes him to move against things that they don't even know what they're doing and god sits above and says one of the reasons why i'd get through it is because i want god to know that i have not changed my mind i believe that the most high rules in the kingdom of man i believe that the king's heart is not in his own hand as much as it is in the lord's hand i believe it is god who causes the waters to turn and the river to overflow its banks and even change its course he has a way of working his will in the kingdoms of men because he has one purpose and that is to build sons we are looking for souls god is looking for sons [Music] we want souls so that he can have more sons but god is after sons he doesn't want screaming babies we're talking about mature sons wheels we're talking about sons trained learned been through the fire have come to a measure of maturity and god is going to manifest himself through such people in the last days if you believe that same man
