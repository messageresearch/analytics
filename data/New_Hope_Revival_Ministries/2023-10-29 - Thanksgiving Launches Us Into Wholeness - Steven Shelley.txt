the time today is Olivia ellsworth's birthday is it 13 all right hold up your hand I know everybody hadn't forgot who you are but this is her birthday today Hallelujah she's a joy and always a beautiful smile we're thankful to the Lord for bringing her into all of our Lives it was God's grace and mercy to us as well as to her and then on Tuesday of this week uh sister Megan yovic has a birthday she's out but let's go ahead and wish her a happy birthday and you can do it again Tuesday night sister Dagmar pritner who streams our services from around velburg Germany her birthday is the same day we are praying for her and we wish her a very happy birthday God bless you Sister prear and then on Wednesday of this coming week November 1st is brother Billy tbo's birthday so we wish him it's not it's not when is your birthday it's when your dad's birthday God bless our pop God bless him Bill and Billy I can really get those two mixed up you want to have two this year but remember each one adds a year if you're going to get the benefit you have to take the you have to take the other with it and then on Saturday of this week is sister bera's birthday from Iceland a old precious friend of ours and we love her very much and we want to wish her a happy birthday let's go to God's word today if you are interested in uh a copy of the prophecy from camp meeting concerning Angelic uh reinforcements there's some on the back table there for you this morning if you didn't already get a copy and you can have one and if we need to get others uh then we certainly will we want to go to the Lord in prayer uh one more time before we approach the word and uh we want to not only pray for Israel as we said but we want to pray for our nation because this is a time I I don't know that there has ever been such an hour that we have had uh 20 attacks on our personal property our our interest in other parts of the world 20 attacks uh no casualties thank God but a great am amount of damage has been done and when we finally decide to retaliate we hit an empty warehouse and the world rejoices you know America's so happy we're we're we're uh you know getting some retaliation and we find out that we have with all of our intelligence capabilities we have bombed an empty Warehouse so we have sent no message to this world none no message at all in fact the message that we're sending is you just continue to take out uh our Assets in other nations and we'll just smile and let you get by and there's probably never been such an hour in America that our leadership was so weak that there's no one to make a decision you know God did a beautiful thing for us this week he put a Godly Man for the first time in a long time we can say there's a Godly Man uh as Speaker of the House and we're very thankful Louisiana has birthed defined man and God has somehow allowed him to be can you imagine the contrast between Pelosi and what God has given us now we're very very thankful for it but uh and you know that's an important office someone said to me recently I don't know what all the hoopla is about that's not a very important office it's actually the third highest office in our nation so it's pretty important and what that means is if something were to happen to our president and vice president at the same time the speaker of the house would be sworn in immediately as president of the United States so to know that there is a man there who who boldly declared from the floor I'm a Bible believing Christian and led by the spirit of God is a wonderful thing and we should certainly praise the Lord for that we want to pray that our leadership can get stronger in this hour not only in its uh bipartisan support for the nation of Israel but also to say to Iran that that uh you know we're tired of your you rattling your Sabers yes and we know we know that uh it's time for that situation to be dealt with so all we can do is pray and that's a lot prayer is a lot so let's just pray just a moment before we go to the word today Father we once again pray as Nathan did for the Peace of Jerusalem we pray oh God that uh peace will reain within her Gates and we pray Lord that she shall uh be a house of prayer for all nations as your word has declared and we pray for for the land of Israel and for the the people of that land your people Lord and brave brave courageous men and women many of them who left the Comforts of our nation many many years ago to stand in solidarity with the Jewish people we pray for their protection today we pray for the IDF and the iaf and we pray for uh each branch of protection for the nation of Israel including mosad we pray Lord that your hand would be upon them and they would make Godly choices that they would make wise decisions and that they would consider the the value of life and not only not only Jewish life but all life is sacred to you we pray for our nation we thank you Lord above it all we thank you for being God over this country over this nation we know that she has forgotten and forsaken you but we thank you that you have never forsaken her we thank you for raising up a Godly Man to be a voice in the House of Representatives we thank you for his witness already and for his testimony we thank you Lord that social media has been full this week of a prayer meeting that was on the floor Lord if there's ever been a time when we we need leaders Who Will Pray who will seek your face who will help this nation turn from her Wicked Ways this is the hour and so much is is depending on the strength of this nation in a time like this so we pray for our leaders oh God that you will truly uh give them strength and courage and wisdom and Leadership father may they may they make good decisions Godly choices may they may they not waffle around for election purposes but may they stand firm for for the protection of our assets around the world the the these are not just buildings they're people they're soldiers their families that are represented there living in those places with children here in America with wives and husbands back here at home and so we pray also for their protection we pray oh God that you will help us to be Watchmen on the wall and that you will inspire Us in the hour in which you would have us to be active on the wall of prayer and in the place of intercession and we will give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the exalted name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we pray and the Saints said amen amen amen let's turn this morning to Psalm 116 I considered speaking today I have really uh dealt with some um backlash as we mentioned on Tuesday night uh since last Sunday and uh I really to be honest with you I left here feeling like quite a failure after the service on Sunday I just could not deliver what was was in my heart I I take full responsibility for that and I ask you to pray for me today it has left me a bit gunshy31 would you all punch one another you know let let her sleep for a little while and then and then punch her and you take your nap it's very very hard when you're already struggling to look around and see so many getting such good rest when you know that you've been up in the night preparing to deliver the word of the Lord I'm a little bit jealous that you're getting such good rest while the word is going forth so if you need me to help coordinate uh your your uh slot for sleep let me know we'll do a sign up schedule are you getting the point yes good I don't say it with any anger at all none whatsoever but I am serious this is not an hour this is just well anyway Psalm 116: 16-19 oh Lord truly I am thy servant I am am thy servant and the son of thine handmade thou Hast loosed my bonds can anybody say Amen to that thou Hast loosed my bonds I will offer to thee the sacrifice of Thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the Lord I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people the the psalmist is saying what I have promised I will do I will fulfill I won't be slack in my payments to the Lord I will pay my vow do you know the Bible said it's better not to make a vow than to make a vow and break it we want to pay our vows to the Lord now in the presence of his people and then verse 19 in the courts of the Lord's House in the midst of thee Oh Jerusalem praise ye the Lord hallelujah Psalm 100 if you'll go there before you're seated Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless bless his name for the Lord is good Lord for the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations do you believe that his his Mercy his truth endureth to all generations father help us now during our time in your word and we will give you praise and honor honor and glory for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen while you're being seated I would just say to the streamers that we will go back and get your prayer request that you have posted here in the chat and we will pray over it I won't stop to mention those needs now but I know that uh that you are concerned and you shared your need and I want you to know we care about you we care about your need and we will go back over these requests I will myself and we'll pray over them and believe that God will meet you at the point of your need he's that kind of God I I said he's that kind of God C could you just uh put up for me the the uh the meaning of the word Thanksgiving I I uh I have not missed I realize that this is October and I I know that we are entering in in a few days to uh Thanksgiving time the month of November but I I just couldn't do it I had prepared this week to speak about some dark things some witchcraft type things and and I just I just couldn't do it I I I made plenty of notes and I have plenty to say about it and I I feel like I know a good bit about the subject but I just couldn't do it I just could not do it I I didn't see any reason at a time like this to glorify Halloween it it gets enough attention there is something wrong with a holy ghost filled believer that would post a picture of a grandchild dressed like a witch and expect me to think that's cute I there's something wrong you know what it is they don't believe they absolutely do not believe that witchcraft is real they think that it's some kind of game they're probably Harry Potter readers you know they they they don't understand uh what they're even playing around with but it has so weakened the church's ability to deal with anything like that because if you don't believe it exists then you're certainly not going to exercise any kind of authority over that stuff and it doesn't do any good to try to exercise authority over what you're opening the door for you have no Authority if you're the one opening the door to such darkness and I can teach I have I've done seminars and I've done whole whole prophetic sessions on witchcraft and opening doors and closing doors and repenting for generational iniquity and I I know the subject pretty well but I just thought at a time like this that we would rather choose to use this season to thank God in advance we don't have to wait until the third Thursday of the month to Show Thanksgiving and praise and honor to God so so we're kicking off the the season of Thanksgiving but we really believe in thanks living we really believe that being thankful is a lifestyle it's not something you celebrate once a year but it's something that you learn to walk in to offer the sacrifice of Thanksgiving the word Thanksgiving that's what I'm showing you here in the Hebrew it is strongs 8426 it is the word toada TOA it's a modern not only is it an ancient Hebrew word it's a modern Hebrew word and in Israel you will hear toada every day of your life there won't be a day that you live that you won't hear the word toada it means in modern Hebrew thank you and we add uh after toada we say toada rabah means very much so when someone says in Israel toar Rah they're saying thank you very much you answer them like many languages you don't answer them you're welcome you answer like other languages of Europe by saying please please is the way you answer when someone says thank you very much so in Hebrew you say toara and the answer is bakha bakha which means please or as we would use it it means uh you're welcome I I thank you for being thankful thank you for thanking me it's like some people who feel it necessary to write a a thank you note for a thank you note you'll got a lot of time that's what I want to say you got a lot of time you don't have to write a thank you note for a thank you note but how many of you like thank you notes well sure we do I want you to look at this word because I think it's an important word that I would like to keep before us as we enter the month of November it's toada properly it means an extension of the [Music] hand so the New Testament is not so strange after all when the Apostle says I would that men everywhere would lift up holy hands without wrath and without doubt he gets that from the Old Testament word Thanksgiving toada it is an extension of the Hand by implication it is an avow now that is not AE I O U that's a vowel v w l for you School teach teachers ah and you can teach children you know how I learned that it it had something to do with borrowing sugar anybody remember that oh my goodness am I the only one that learned it that way the little girl the little girl couldn't talk very plain she went over and borrowed a cup of sugar for her for her mother from the neighbor and when she went back she gave her a can handed her the cup of sugar and she said AE I ow you a cup of [Music] sugar AE lady I owe you a cup of sugar oh my goodness that's not the vowel we're talking about the word of vowel means an affirmation of the truth that you believe when you are showing God toada when you are giving God Thanksgiving when you are extending your hand to him you're not just saying thank you sir right you're saying I believe that you are good and I believe that you are faithful and I believe that every good thing that happens to me is because of you and I believe that you will never leave me nor forsake me and I believe that you will go with me even to the end of the Earth and I believe that though I Ascend in the heaven you're there though I make my bed in hell you're there and I believe it goes on and on and on and on and on it is an a vowel it is a statement that says I believe this is the truth that I believe an avow also means an honest admission I'm just honestly expressing that I can't make it without you it's adoration specifically a choir or A procession of worshippers have you ever heard of a worship parade this is a parade of people that are maybe we call it a Jericho March and there's a parade of people who are singing praises and shouting praises to the Lord that's what Thanksgiving means it means AOW confession so that's not the kind that happens behind the curtain in a in a confessional it's not the kind that takes place under a rock so no one can hear you or see you but it's it's a loud confession it's it's vocal Thanksgiving it's not silently being thankful it's about vocally being thankful it's about a sacrifice of praise it is a Thanksgiving or a thanks offering it's the word that is used for bringing an offering to the Lord not to cover sin not to cover a trespass not to ask for something or to gain favor for something you're going to need it's just a simple offering that you bring to the Lord that says I've got something to thank you for Lord like the old songwriter said Lord I didn't come here to ask you for anything I just come to talk to you I just come to thank you for all the other times you have come to my rescue in modern Hebrew you might find it interesting that that the that the word that's used for in modern Hebrew for turkey is from it's very similar to the root of the word that we're looking at now toada for Thanksgiving and so they believe that in modern Hebrew someone has drawn the connection so that you would remember uh uh the turkey at Thanksgiving and by the way it's very hard to get a turkey in Israel for Thanksgiving if you don't believe that I can tell you how expensive it almost $200 but we had one a fresh one we had to learn what to do with it it didn't come like the like they usually come but we made the best Thanksgiving we've ever had in Israel and we had some wonderful memories that are attached to that but Thanksgiving is not a day it's not a day it's an attitude it's an attitude that we in fact if you'll if you'll go on it says thanks is the speaking of the of the Excellence of a person or object this is all from the Hebrew with the focus on what does that say personal gratitude you you you can't just be corporately thankful this is an expression that comes from the innermost being it is an attitude of Thanksgiving an attitude of thanking God for his promise for deliverance are you cheaters reading the rest even while still you you mean you mean toada in Hebrew means all that yes every bit of this is from the Hebrew it it's an attitude of thanking God for his promise for deliverance even when you need Deliverance even when you've not seen the reality of the Deliverance that you you're pressing in for in fact before before it happens I'm going to give God an offering that says thank you Papa thank you ABA because you've done it before and if you've done it before I have no reason to think that you won't do it again and again and again and again and again again yeah so the simple word translated in English Thanksgiving to means all of that and it actually means about a half a paragraph more than that but I thought we would stop there in Psalm 50 if you'll go there with me or or wait for it to be on the screen offer unto God Thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the most high this is one of about a dozen references that combines the word toada with paying a vow with fulfilling a promise a man is no better than his word sometimes in life we make obligations and we forget them because we're human surely we can show Grace for one another has anybody ever forgotten something that you said you would do and you just didn't do it but it wasn't because you wanted to be ridiculous it's because you just forgot you just failed to keep your in fact I've learned if I don't do it right away if it's one of those things that you can't do right away I'm in trouble a and that's why I went on and said you better Zach you better make your announcement now because even though it's written here as I've proven week after week just because I write it down don't mean I'm going to look at it to read it a a and so we want to be sure that as we enter in to a a season of Walking In Thanksgiving that we are preparing our offerings our I don't mean finances but but it's good because we've learned that giving is the key to coming out of poverty we've learned that we've learned that one of the ways we get out of the mess is to give our way out not complain our way out but to give our way out out we've learned the laws of seed time and harvest come on now and we've learned that we don't we don't round it uh down right we round it up somebody said do you have scripture for that I absolutely do the Bible said and the fat thereof go back and make sure you get a healthy scoop of fat when you lay your piece of meat on the altar that's what the scripture said make sure that you you're not doing it to the penny to begrudge God what belongs to him but Heap him up on Heap him up just a little bit you know all the Charities ask you to round it up don't they I see that I see the you you go to get a hamburger and they want to know where you round up your bill to help some charity out you ought to try rounding it up for him you ought to say Lord anyway I said it wasn't about it wasn't about giving it's about giving not necessarily from the wallet but preparing an offering of Thanksgiving to the Lord because he's always worthy and then he said offer unto God Thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the most high and I may you may not have picked up 15 you did and call upon me in the day of trouble I will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me me I want to make sure you see the the context of that offer unto God Thanksgiving an offering of thanks in advance and then pay thy vows to the most high and call upon me in the day of trouble I will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me Thanksgiving launches us into to a level of wholeness that we desperately need in the body of Christ we become fragmented by our broken relationships we become damaged by the things that we have walked through alone in life and there is one thing that will restore us to wholeness quicker than anything else and that's learning to walk in a spirit in an attitude of Thanksgiving to the Lord I don't just mean Church we're a church that learns the value of praising when you get here but I mean when you wake up on Monday morning and you just get up thankful because you're a king's kid I just want to thank you that I'm a child of the king I just want to thank you that you have brought me a mighty long way instead of focusing on how far left we have to go we ought to focus on how far God has brought us and that if he can bring us this far guess what he'll do come on he'll carry us the rest of the way that uh uh then then down verse 23 of Psalm 50 I want to go to the other place that toah is used who so offereth praise glorify me and to him that ation a right will I show the salvation of God where is the word toada remember toada means Thanksgiving you don't see the word Thanksgiving in English appear in vers but the word TOA is there where is it it's praise there are several Hebrew words that are translated praise there are two Hebrew words that are translated Thanksgiving and sometime TOA which is usually translated Thanksgiving is also translated as praise who so offer Thanksgiving or a praise offering glorify me and to him that ereth his conversation a right will I sh show the salvation of God lord would you put a watch over my heart help me now help me now put a watch over my heart and to stay on my lips Lord put a lock on my lips squeeze my cheeks when I run off too much at the mouth come on the psalmist is saying if you will order your conversation if you will not allow allow your mouth to overload the rest of you if you will choose your words wisely and offer God praise that's do his name while choosing your words in life words that edify words that glorify not words that that murmur and complain and belly ache help me now so both of these verses Psalm 504 and 15 and psalm 5023 use the word toada emphasizing as a sacrifice and the sacrifice is what you are offering ahead of time it's not the kind of sacrifice that you commit a transgression and you bring an offering to cover what's already done it's a Thanksgiving offering and in a Thanksgiving offering you are offering God Advance praise you're offering God thanks in advance for what he is going to do you don't wait until the victory comes to dance you don't wait for the sun to shine to dance you dance in the rain you've give God praise now you don't wait for the day you've praised him in the night yes look at Psalms 26 just a moment verse 6 and 7 this is an interesting Psalm I will wash mine hands in inany in innocency so will I Compass thine altar oh Lord that I may publish with the voice of Thanksgiving and tell of all thy wondrous Works punch your neighbor it's not your turn tell them not your turn your turn comes later at about 2:00 then that's going to be your turn when we were in the back this morning notice this morning when we were in the back I noticed the preparation that was going on in here I look folk I I I don't know how to tell you this but uh I was having a gastronomic jubilee have you ever had one I was eating something that was so good good how many of you eat to eat you know you just eat and you get tired of eating but there comes a time that God has blessed your lips Josh no wonder you can get a little pudgy I should have been Brazilian sister Claudia brought us a gift oh Lord I don't need a knickknack just bring me more of that if you can fry something this is Southern if you can fry something and it not be greasy you are a master sister Claudia you are a master I was sitting there eat and and every every bite saying oh Lord that is so good oh my that is so tasty and I glanced up at the screen and you people were working so hard to prepare the atmosphere in here and I said oh Lord help me I'm ashamed they're in there working so hard and I am licking my lips enjoying every bite but we have to take turns what I saw was they were worshiping the Lord the the flag was waving and they were walking around not just one but several were walking around and did you know that's what this verse is saying this is your verse come on if you sit there and you say I don't know why they're when I get to church there's folks walking around just walking around in the altar up there I don't know why here it is for you verse six that's verse seven there we go I will wash my hands in innocency so will I Compass thine altar oh Lord the complete Jewish Bible said I will walk about or around your altar I will search my life first I didn't come here before the service to get somebody else's stuff right I come in to get me right I will wash my hands in innocency I will Purge my own thoughts I will watch my own words I will walk around your altar oh God to let you know that you are worthy You Are Holy you mean more to me than what people think about me hello and then look at the next verse that I that IE I'll wash my hands in innocency I will walk about your altar that I may publish with the voice of to yes to R my Lord and tell of all thy wondrous work Works folks some people are complainers oh it's quiet I'm just a human and names are popping in my head your reputation will precede you when you're a murmurer hello your reputation will precede you when you're a praiser you're going to be one or the other you're either going to be a complainer or you're going to be a praiser I choose oh my God I choose today Lord not to complain even though there's things to complain about I choose to come with a praise I choose to leave here with a praise I choose to live My Week with a praise some people are complainers and some are praisers and the real question is which one are you complainers or worriers thankful people are praisers Warriors are the first to complain they're always looking for somebody else to moan with them I'm tired of Moaning I'm tired of groaning I'm tired of woe is me I'm tired of mourning over what's been lost I'm ready to toada I'm ready to show some Thanksgiving to the Lord O there a little something on that do I more often look over the blessings of the Lord and focus on things that are not going my way or am I constantly watching for the loving care of God in my life looking and searching for another opportunity to express some praise and some gratitude and I don't mean praise the Lord as some some punctuation to a sentence that doesn't mean anything praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord thank you Jesus praise the Lord hallelujah you know brother I was thank you Lord you know brother the other day praise the Lord I'm not talking about punctuating a sentence when you can't make a good sentence that's not what I'm talking about but I'm talking about setting your heart there's a dial on your heart and I'm talking about dialing in to Thanksgiving it's the solution for grief it'll deal with the spirit of heaviness in your life Thanksgiving will deal with a complaining spirit in your life hello come on Thanksgiving will cause you to look inward instead of outward it'll cause you to say Lord what must I do that I can maintain I want to maintain this kind of Praise I want you to see what the Apostle Paul says about the end time are you still with me second Timothy chapter 3 this is my translation and uh I have uh chosen some words using different different references here and I have put them in parentheses like you'll see in the Amplified Bible sometime so let's follow this through this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come Fierce Times Hard Times difficult times you better prepare yourself that's right yes yes we're living in days of Plenty but we we may not always have days of Plenty so we need to prepare ourselves we need to prepare our children for difficult days that may possibly come before the bride is raptured out of here and the Apostle is saying this know that in the last days perilous Fierce hard difficult times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves me me me me me me me me me me me I I I I I I've had it so hard come on Covetous lovers of money boasters self- exalted bragger on proud arrogant self-important hoty blasphemers defaming demeaning disobedient to parents I didn't think we needed to break that down I figure everybody in the house knows what it means to be disobedient as long as you're depending on your parents you ought to obey your parents and when you're no longer depending on them when they're right you ought to obey them anyhow hello unthankful ungrateful Unholy I like the way this Bears out Unholy it's opposing what is Holy it's not just the lack of Holiness it it's positioning yourself against Holiness h opposing what is sacred having no reverence without natural affection hard-hearted unfeeling without regard for others see that natural affection is often translated as something sexual but the root of that word is not coming out of something sexual it's coming out of someone who doesn't feel who has become know numb who lives in numbness without regard for others now that very spirit is what turns people into an alternative Spirit that's what turns into a homosexual or perverted Spirit it comes from being unfeeling and hard-hearted and selfish and without regard for others it comes from a spirit of Pride we know that from the word truce Breakers irreconcilable false accusers slanderous incontinent which means without self-control driven by appetites and passions Fierce Savage brutal despisers of those that are good traitors betrayers hey now look what he means rash Reckless it's going to be real quiet now Thoughtless and let's all on the count of three read the next one would you see if you see yourself yeah one two three headstrong you don't lead your way with your head you lead your way with your faith somebody said follow your heart wrong yes not follow your heart your heart can deceive you your emotions can fool you your thoughts can lead you astray your faith is what you follow come on now not headstrong leading with your head thoughtless rash Reckless forcing others to tiptoe around you High minded conceited puffed up having no sense senseless not even being aware of what you're putting off no sense of what vibe or what message you're sending as you stomp around lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God hello come on church compromis is the Trojan Horse of the word church having a form of godliness holding to a structure of piety but denying the power thereof from such turn away let me tell you something hypocrisy is the greatest offense to the Living God hypocrisy to know to do good and not do it to confess to live right and not live it is the greatest offense in the face of a holy God so having a form of godliness well I go to church every two every Sunday every Tuesday I pay my tithe you know I know I'm okay I'm doing what God would have me to do while totally ignoring the fact that you're leading with your head and you're conceited and puffed up and loving Pleasures more than God so having a form of godliness is not enough because if you're denying the power thereof the word of God says get away from those kind of people didn't say take them to dinner invite him to the party it said get away from folks like that until you walk around the altar washing your hands in innocency until you get everything made just right with the Lord be careful how you how you flock with with Geese of the same kind of nature as the one you've got now there there's some ugly things here in these verses ugly perverse horrible things but you know one of the things that shocks me the most is that Paul is warning Timothy that in the last days dark Spirits coming into the world would cause trouble for the church for for some it might be a bit surprising for me it is that tucked in here among such hideous and destructive Spirits is a warning that there would be a swarm of unthankful people that would fill the church Church in the end time not just traitors heady high-minded incontinent lovers of God lovers of pleasure more than of God but that there would be a swarm of unthankful people and the Apostle is placing it in the same order of these other fleshy sins to be unthankful to walk in in gratitude as an end time bride people we are facing many awful and ugly attitudes udes the least of which is not ingratitude ingratitude is defined as a lack of proper appreciation or thanks for something or somebody the dictionary defines being unappreciative as not fully understanding recognizing or placing the proper value on something we have a tendency not to Value something until we lose it that's not how Believers are to operate one may never expect that being unthankful would make it to such a hateful and dark list or that it would be deserving of the same harsh judgment as the other negative attributes in the Apostle Paul's warning but nonetheless being ungrateful unthankful is not here by mistake we're living in a very unthankful ungrateful generation come on it's being unthankful really such a bad thing we don't know for sure if these troubling issues are listed in order of importance but we can feel safe that the Apostle listed them as the spirit of Truth brought them to his mind so it may in fact be important to note that in verse two being unthankful is mentioned before being Unholy I got my knee covered but I take everything in life for granted hello I got my hair do right I'm holy enough but I'm not showing enough gratitude to God and to others come on now I didn't mean to get so so if a lack of Holiness remember what Hebrews 12:14 says follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord so if a lack of Holiness would keep someone from seeing the Lord what do you think the result of being unthankful would be don't forget we're being warned in verse 5 to turn away from these kinds of people to purposely avoid associating with those who are under the influence of these dangerous attitudes and Spirits are you hearing me today Church it must be important if the Apostle is telling us pull away from people like that people who blame everybody else for their problems but we we cannot take the moral high road and avoid others until we examine our own hearts for any traces of these attacks against the end time people so the Apostle is indicating that one of the things the enemy will use against the people of God in the end time is a is an attitude of being unthankful or not having proper gratitude 1 Thessalonians 5 verse 15-18 see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to what and to all men Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing in everything not for in in everything help me give thanks in every everything give thanks I was left out in everything I deserve the raise that he got in everything I can't hardly make my car payment and she's rolling up with a new one in everything I can't buy school clothes for my children and yet that sister comes in here with a yet another new dress in everything first of all something you need to understand it's your responsibility to clothe your children if you're going to have them hello so you get that set up inside you get that fixed then you won't be looking to other people when God blesses you from the you'll say woo thank God for that amen praise the Lord I sure appreciate that but you won't be expecting it from others come on now in everything in everything in everything when the when the when the shower leaks in everything I got a leaky faucet I can't fix I do I'm telling you the truth I got a leaky faucet I can't fix it's filling up my sepy tank and I'm going to have to have it I'm going to have to have it pumped again but I just decided in everything I'm going to give God thanks it's a way to get things taken care of in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you it's always the will of God for you and I to give God thanks it's always the will of God for you and I to live in Thanksgiving yes amen I believe that we are really living in an hour that we're not seeing breakthroughs in certain areas of prayer and when I recognize that that may be my case or it might be something prevailing in the body I begin to wonder what kinds of things can hinder my prayers what kinds of things can keep me from seeing the Breakthrough and the Overflow in certain areas of my life and if I were you this morning I would hear my pastor and I would search my heart and I would discover whether or not I am showing God the right amount of Thanksgiving now remember I'm not just talking about your church praise that's right I want you to know that that is you folks do good I I'm so thankful for you but I want you to know that's not when you're being the greatest test is is coming to you when you're in here the greatest test is when you get out there in everything give thanks in everything well I'm tired of renting I know what that feels like I rented a good good portion of my life I know what that feels like but I want to thank God for a place to sleep with a roof over my head come on and a bed to sleep in in everything give thanks in in the Amplified Bible uh first Thessalonians 5:18 the verse we just read says thank God in everything no matter what the circumstances may be be thankful and give thanks that pretty well covers it all for this is the will of God for you who are in Christ Jesus the revealer and the mediator of that will regardless of what Circle you're in not everyone appreciates what you do for them no matter how hard you try to please some people they're never going to completely appreciate what has been done for them or at the least acknowledge the effort you have put into something that they benefit from so if you're waiting on thanks you'll lose your blessing while you wait if you're waiting on the apology you'll lose your blessing while you wait so you just Praise Him you just thank him you just give him when you see people aren't very thankful and appreciative and even take advantage have you ever been taken advantage of it don't feel good hello you got to praise Him Anyway you've got to thank him anyway amen there are some people in the world and even in the church who are just simply unthankful people I've heard people pray for their food and say for these gifts we ask you to make us truly thankful that's a mouthful what are you saying when you ask such a prayer as that make me thankful the only way I know for you to be made thankful is to do without are you really asking God to help you do without so you'll start appreciating what he gives you I don't think so I believe being thankful is something you ought to be able to cook up on your own hello Lord help me you could say Lord help me to always be thankful but I don't think I'd pray make me thankful cuz the cow might dry up and quit giving milk so you'll be thankful for the milk you used to get hello no no no we can just set our our attitude on one of gratitude an attitude of gratitude and say Lord if it were not for you had it not been for you your hand oh you brought me such a mighty Long Way being thankful is not a natural state of mind for most people being thankful often comes from experiencing want being thankful for what you have often comes from remembering what you did not have a woman can be thankful now listen to this a woman can be thankful for the husband that she had has if she can understand what it means to not have a good husband I don't mean you get to or three choices and chances and then you pick from the best of your experiences I mean look around let me tell you how amazing your husband will look if if you start looking around the world around you even the church around you that's right oh some people don't have it real good in here believe I'll take a little you better be glad that God doesn't have as generous of a return policy as as some Walmarts and stores like that do a man will be thankful for the job he has when he's gone through a long period of time where he had no job or work tirelessly on a job that did not satisfy his needs I don't mind when I ask somebody how their job is and they say it's a job I don't mind that that doesn't offend me because I have learned that liking what you do is helpful but it's not necessary in providing for your family in other words you don't have to like it you just got to be thankful you got it you show God enough gratitude and thanks for the situation that you find yourself in now and you do it I mean go way out in your praise just just really pour it on and see if God can't turn that around being broke flat busted broke on I don't mean what some people say is broke broke because your allowance run out but you know where to find some more right I don't mean broke but you could draw from your savings account right I mean flat busted broke nothing no cushion no Dave Ramsey cushion emergency fund let me tell you about that emergency fund you touch it it's gone you put it back in place you'll need it again don't put that up thinking it's a savings account cuz the washer is going to break down and the dryer's going to break down come on and the lawnmower is going to break down hello it's life it's life I'm just thankful we don't have to chip ice and go down down to the to the ice house build a little little uh you know shed over the stream and put the ice in that and pack it in sawdust and oh Lord thank you thank you thank you that I don't have to draw water my my my faucets may be leaky but oh thank God they run I turn them on and the water comes and I don't have to haul the hello being broke teaches you how to be thankful for what you already have being sick can teach you how to be thankful for pain-free days staring death in the face can teach you how to be thankful for each and every day with those you love being lonely can teach you how to be thankful for someone who goes out of their way to be your friend thankful people are usually people who have been down the road of adversity they are people who know what it means to struggle there are people who have not had the world handed to them on a silver platter they work hard to get where they're at I'm talking about thankful people they worked hard to get where they're at they endured much expense and labor to reach a certain place in life they did all they could and when that failed they prayed to Jesus before the help came so they know that they know that they know where their help has come from so it's just a it's just a natural overflow to give him praise my grand almost always drove a new car she worked very hard she didn't make enough leading a church but she had a good job as a as a tax preparer somewhat of an accountant when she died she had a little something to leave behind because she worked hard it vexed my grandfather he worked as a uh he worked as a uh contracted help at uh Postman a contracted postman on post a civilian job but on Fort Benning it was a good job it made him enough money to do what he wanted to do bought him a lot of fishing poles and a lot of saws and a tractor ever now and again and just about anything he wanted but if he needed a new vehicle he he wasn't going to be able to afford that with his he would have had to stop buying boats and hand tools and when it come time to buy a new vehicle it was my grandmother that bought the vehicle and put him in a truck and you'd think that your wife working like that and giving you a a a a new truck to drive would would cause you not to want to Grumble and complain all the time but my granny would say uh honey I've got to leave early today for church because I got to go pick up sister so and so and sister so and so and brothers I got to go pick up them on my way to church they don't have a way to get to church and he would get so mad sister Flo knows what I'm talking about he would get so mad you're going to run that car in the ground not because she drove it to church the biggest portion of the miles but because she dared go by and pick up somebody else that didn't have that was going to destroy the vehicle you see what kind of spirit some people carry ungrateful Spirit he's driving a brand new Ford truck top of the line and he's worried about her automobile that she's going to run in the ground taking sister so and so to church and you know what I would hear her say honey don't worry about it it'll be all right I don't worry about it God will take care of us and I thought one of these days one of these days one of these days she is going to remind him I I I I really wished for the day that she would tell him and when I wear mine out told them folks to church I'm going to take yours the one I bought you and I'm going to wear it out taking people to church but one day she'd had all she could take and she never threw that truck up in his face but here's what she said she said now don't say another word to me about my vehicle wearing out to toing people to church God is the one who gave me that vehicle and if I wear it out for him he'll give me another one and I'll wear that one out for him but I'm telling you don't say another word to me about it and from that moment on every two years like clockwork before she ever pull pulled one out of warranty she went back down so a few weeks before she died she went down and bought a brand new Lincoln town car and I sure did en enjoy driving that one for years she said I won't get to enjoy it but she said just to show the devil now my grandfather was gone but just to show the devil she said I'm going to change I'm adding it to the wheel I'm putting it right at the top of the wheel and I'm going to say because I know that Steve will wear it out for Jesus I want him to have it because he'll wear that one out and even though Big Mama's not around God will give him another one to wear out doing the work of the Lord come on it's your attitude it he had an attitude to where he just couldn't see the goodness of God in his life and it left him so bitter such a wonderful man such a precious man in so many ways but he would not he could not come to that place of just saying lord it's because of you if it were not for you Lord had you not been such a good God come on the Bible sets unthankful people apart from thankful people to be unthankful is a Grievious attribute of sin when someone does something for you the response of your heart and your lips should be it's so cheap it costs so little to say to somebody thank you we get so busy it's so so easy to forget thank you for your prayers thank you for your faithfulness that's why I got on there on the on the chat on the app I just was so blessed by the fact that the pain was almost completely gone the next morning after two days of of really serious pain and I knew that I hadn't healed you know naturally I knew that the pain wasn't gone because the body had had just healed itself the thing had run its course it had gotten better I knew that somebody had touched the Lord and I wanted to say thank you I want to be a thankful hearted person don't you whether it's God or your next door neighbor or someone in the church or even a complete stranger brother Shaw he took brother Jim and Pastor Ryan Jasper to brunch one day while they were here Monday I believe it was they went to after looking around for it a bit they went to IHOP in Columbus they had a meal and both brother Shaw told me and Pastor Ryan told me and they were sharing he said he Pastor Ryan Jasper didn't feel like they had been particularly loud I know brother Shaw can get pretty excited because I saw him on YouTube this week and I know that he can stand for the word when he has to he was greatly challenged I didn't know this even happened he was greatly challenged on the street and he let let me just tell you he stood up to the challenge he was told he was going to hell because he believed in one God brother I'd rather take that chance I'd rather take that chance than any chance I know and he stood up now I know he can get a little loud but Pastor Ryan said he didn't feel like they were particularly loud they were just sharing constantly the whole time they were there just sharing the goodness of God and there was a man and his wife a couple sitting were they Caucasian was it an African-American couple I thought that's what he told me an African-American couple sitting over there somewhere having their breakfast at the same time and when the three men went up to pay the bill it had been paid for Glory you say well that what was that a a $35 meal or $3 or $20 meal oh my my my my every one of those men could could have could have somehow paid for their food it wasn't it wasn't the fact that they couldn't do it it was the fact that they were honoring God and God put it on somebody's heart to be I want to be the one I want to be like that little couple I want to that's how I want to be I want to be like that little couple sensitive to the voice of the Holy Spirit and left they couldn't even thank him they didn't even know their name so guess who got the thanks Lord thank you that you did that for us see I I I'm telling you it really really makes a difference when someone gives you something that belongs to them time th this is the one thing I I really struggle with sometime is how people devalue time if someone gives you their time they're giving you one of the most valuable things they possess their time I I feel like I don't mean to complain I want to be a praiser I feel like sometimes people don't value other people's time mine sometimes I feel that way I try not to let it get down in my heart what I try to let it do is remind me that that if somebody is choosing to give me a little bit of their time I I want to be thankful for that I I want to I do I want to I want them to know I appreciate that I think that it is a good thing for us to do if someone's giving you time or money or prayer love I think our heart ought to be quick to respond I'm I'm thankful thank you what really bothers me is I think sometime when when people think that you've got a lot or you have a lot of something time for instance or money or whatever and they do something for you I think sometime people Express their gratitude in a little less of a way because they're they're judging your they're estimating your ability to do I don't think it ought to be that way I don't think it ought to be that way I I think if I've got a a a a pantry full of canned goods 300 jars of green beans and I give you a couple jars I think that you ought to show or whoever gives them to you I think we ought to show the same thankful grateful because because it's something we didn't have it's something that somebody took of theirs and shared it with us there are certain people sometime will recommend a product to me that has helped them in different ways and some people will send you a link some people will deliver it to your doorstep some people will bring you a sample pack they'll literally take from what they have so that you can try the flavors so that you don't buy a flavor of something that you don't like that says something about who we are help me now oh yes praise God I'm all right we should give thanks to the Lord first Ephesians 5:20 giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ everything every good day every pay raise even a quarter every good doctor report every help every encouragement every big every little thing that encourages and blesses our life we should show our thanks to God without thankfulness we're almost assuredly we will almost assuredly hinder the working of the holy spirit in our life Psalm and verse4 we read enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name we understand that being thankful to God will always lead us into higher praise it does Thanksgiving leads us into higher praise Thanksgiving and praise go hand hand in hand praise is a physical expression for being thankful for who the Lord is and for what he is doing in our lives we use our voices we use the posture of our bodies to praise the Lord because our heart is thankful Thanksgiving in the heart of a Believer is Never Satisfied to remain locked in it will always find an audible physical way to express itself in Praise hello I want to read another portion of scripture to you before we close I want you to go to Luke 17 with me for just a moment verses 11-9 and it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee if you're watching the news that's the West Bank as he entered into a certain Village there met him 10 men that were lepers which stood AAR off and they lifted up their voices and said Jesus Master have mercy on us and when he saw them he said unto them go show thyselves show yourselves under the priest and it came to pass as they went never anointed them never prayed over them he just said go get cleared go show yourselves under the priest and it came to pass that as they went what they were cleansed and one of them [Music] 10% one of them when he saw that he was heill turn back and with a what L and with a loud voice you think the Bible just put that in there for fun no it wanted to describe to you this man's gratitude Hallelujah he was thankful his life just changed he could go home to his wife he could go home to his children he could walk up and down the street without crying unclean unclean unclean he could put his regular road back on he could go right up and worship among other worshippers he didn't have to go into certain little room set aside for those of leprosy when he saw he was healed he turned back and with a loud voice he glorified God and fell down on his fa face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a Samaritan he wasn't even a Jew right he was a Samaritan and Jesus answering said were there not 10 cleansed but where are the nine there are not found that return to give glory to God save this stranger and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole what an amazing Miracle what an amazing testimony leprosy in Bible times was a terrible thing we're not exactly sure what it looked like while it may have described what is known as Hansen's Disease the word probably included other skin diseases as well once a person and caught it it was considered incurable and those diagnosed with Leprosy were banned from society Leviticus 1345 and 46 tells us the person with such an infectious disease must wear torn clothes let his hair be uncamp cover the lower part of his face and cry out unclean unclean as long as he has the infection he remains unclean he must live alone he must live outside the camp while early Israelites didn't operate on the The Germ theory of disease they understood something about infectious diseases and those suspected of leprosy were kept isolated until their diagnosis was confirmed but the loathing directed all lepers directed at all lepers was not merely a fear of a disease leprosy made a person ritually unclean to touch a leper defiled a Jew almost as much as touching a dead person in a sense leprosy was a sign of God's dis favor and it was treated that way later Jewish practice prescribed that while lepers might attend the synagogue they must be first to enter and last to leave they must stay in a special compartment to isolate them from the other worshippers no less than a distance of six feet must be kept from any leper to the rabbis The Cure of a leper was as difficult as raising a person from the dead the word cleansed here in verse 17 means to heal a person of a disease that Mak makes one ceremonially unclean to make him clean to heal him especially of leprosy it was more than a healing but it was also a cleansing verse 14 is the key to understanding what happened and as they went they were cleansed the Greek construction uses the preposition in in remember brother brandom talking about in morphe it literally means in the going they were cleansed there came a point as they began to obey Jesus that their healing took place all of a sudden he said go show yourselves even though we talk about someone who believes belief doesn't exist in a vacuum faith is exhibited in what we actually do because these lepers believe they begin to obey and go to the village where the priest live as Jesus brother James says in the same way Faith by itself if it is not accompanied by action is dead can you imagine the social stigma that these 10 men faced every day of their life they were unable to be around their families they had to watch their children grow from a distance they lived in colonies with other lepos people they were surrounded every day with the sickness of others and the stench of their own Rotting Flesh so these 10 men cry out to Jesus for their healing and he heal them as they were going but only one with was truly thankful and one of them when he saw that he was healed while the other nine went on their way there this one falls on his face at the feet of Jesus and cries out with a loud voice of Thanksgiving glorifying God Jesus noticed a distinction between this man and the other nine he said weren't weren't there 10 all of you together where about the other nine 10 were cleansed but only one is thankful what happened to the other nine only 10 % of those cleansed that day were thankful thank God for the few that come back to say Thank You Look what Jesus did for the thankful man that he didn't do for the other nine men who scurried off in a hurry to go about their lives in verse 19 he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole this man was expressing thankfulness but Jesus accounted it to him for faith Faith makes us thankful when we are thankful God sees Faith people all the time I need more faith maybe what we really need is I need to be more thankful the phrase made you well or made thee whole is the Greek word Soo it's the same word translated to save or salvation a Suter in Greek is a savior a deliverer and the noun form of sotia is used widely of Salvation Soo is the con in the context means to preserve or rescue from natural dangers and afflictions to save to keep from harm to preserve to rescue to keep safe or free from disease this passage h at the fact that Jesus offers this leper more than the others they received healing but this leper received deeper salvation his faith had prompted him to return to the feet of Jesus and thanks and that personal contact that personal submission signifies a soul healing a wholeness something taking place on the inside that's more than Skin Deep Thanksgiving launches us into Holiness just a few more minutes as many of you know leprosy causes the flesh to die off on its victim's body literally fingers and toes and other extremities fall off as well they lose the ability to feel pain which causes them to do great harm to their bodies without even knowing it most of the time there is a difference between being healed of leprosy and being made whole as the thankful man was many Bible scholars believe that the original nine men went away healed of leprosy but still carrying the scars of their sickness and its Devastation to their bodies in other words nerve damage on the other hand the thankful man left that day not only healed of the terrible disease but what the Bible say also made whole in other words the Lord restored to him what the sickness had stolen from him this could mean even more than the body being restored to its original state but also his relationship with other people like his family and even his place of status within the community however you look at it Jesus did something more for the thankful man than he did for the unth thanful men here is why our worship is so important it is showing our thankfulness for his love for us and what he has done in our lives it brings into our lives that rearward the Bible talks about that extra blessing the added bonus the thing that not everybody else gets why don't you think about what you have to be thankful for today why not make a list of things that God has brought you through and tell him one more time thank you there is power in Brokenness the power to be made whole amen the power of being made whole is in finding an identity beyond your Brokenness hear me please it's not something Christ can exclusively do for you it is a process he participates in and provides for but you are the key you must choose to be thankful even in the hottest battle please listen musicians are coming even in the hottest batt battle and in the most violent of storms stay connected to Jesus don't turn him loose Don't Unplug from him or from your brothers and sisters if you do you will unravel we connect to Christ by connecting to his children our former Amish brother posted the song that sister Anna Christin posted this week right out your storm there's a line in that song that says hold on to Jesus another little men and I are plain brother I don't know him some some of brother Levi's context he said well I'd rather him hold on to me I understand the concept Jesus never turns you loose but you're not merely blessed because he's holding on to you you're blessed when you can in spite of everything hold on to him your connection to him is through faith and faith is rooted in gratitude and thankfulness let's stand before Benjamin comes to lead us I want us to sing just a little bit of give thanks with a grateful heart then he'll come and lead us in something else I'm going to need the words for sure give thanks with a grateful heart give thanks to to the Holy One give thanks because Jesus Christ his [Music] son and now let the weak say I am strong and let the poor say I am rich
