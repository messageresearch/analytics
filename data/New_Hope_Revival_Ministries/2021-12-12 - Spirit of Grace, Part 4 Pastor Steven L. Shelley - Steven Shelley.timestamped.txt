[37:47] help us
[37:48] if you will get ready to come or go
[37:51] ahead and come and get ready i would
[37:54] like to read a scripture to you that the
[37:55] lord just laid upon my heart
[37:57] romans chapter 8 starting in verse 29
[38:01] for whom he did for no
[38:03] he also did predestinate
[38:06] to be conformed to the image of his son
[38:10] that he might be that he might be
[38:14] the firstborn among many brethren
[38:17] moreover whom he did predestinate
[38:21] them he also called and whom he called
[38:25] them he also justified
[38:27] and whom he justified
[38:30] them he also glorified
[38:32] what shall we say to these things
[38:36] if god before us
[38:38] who can be against us
[38:41] he that spared not his own son but
[38:44] delivered him up for us all
[38:47] how shall he not with him also freely
[38:50] give us
[38:51] all things
[38:53] who shall lay anything
[38:56] to the charge of god's elect
[38:58] it is god that justifieth
[39:02] who is he that condemneth
[39:04] it is christ that died ye rather that is
[39:08] risen again who is even at the right
[39:10] hand of god who also maketh intercession
[39:14] for us
[39:16] who shall separate us from the love of
[39:19] christ
[39:21] shall tribulation
[39:23] or distress
[39:24] or persecution
[39:26] or famine or nakedness or peril or sword
[39:32] that is as it is written for thy sake
[39:35] we are killed all the day long
[39:38] we are accounted as sheep for the
[39:40] slaughter
[39:42] nay in all of these things we are more
[39:46] than conquerors
[39:48] through him that loved us
[39:51] for i am persuaded that neither death
[39:55] nor life
[39:56] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[40:01] nor things present nor things to come
[40:05] nor height nor depth nor any creature
[40:09] shall be able to separate us from the
[40:12] love of god
[40:14] which is in christ jesus

[55:20] you may be seated this morning
[55:23] thank you
[55:24] i
[55:26] know that some of you didn't know that
[55:27] uh i was battling this week but
[55:31] you who pray for me every day it
[55:33] shouldn't matter that's great your
[55:34] prayers were appreciated
[55:36] yesterday we put a little something on
[55:38] our private facebook page
[55:40] just because i wanted to make sure i
[55:42] could get here
[55:45] friday night if i would have had to come
[55:47] i wouldn't have made it that i i'm just
[55:49] being honest i couldn't put any weight
[55:51] on my foot and have been on a scooter
[55:54] ever since
[55:55] but after putting that message on
[55:57] yesterday afternoon and you all praying
[56:00] when i woke up this morning i was able
[56:02] to put some weight on that foot
[56:04] and uh i don't want to put any extra on
[56:07] it because i don't want to do anything
[56:09] to damage it because in the years past
[56:11] that's been the problem sunday would
[56:13] come i would make it through sunday
[56:15] preaching in a shoe and then suffer for
[56:18] a few more extra days that i don't have
[56:20] to do that as soon as you started
[56:22] singing this morning as soon as you
[56:24] started worshiping the lord i felt him
[56:26] touch me
[56:28] there's nothing like this atmosphere
[56:31] it's the only thing that got me out of
[56:33] bed this morning was the anticipation
[56:36] of getting in this atmosphere
[56:39] knowing that anything can happen
[56:42] when jesus is being lifted up and
[56:44] glorified and being praised so i have
[56:48] the victory i want you to know that
[56:49] right now i've got the victory
[56:52] we do want to uh update you on zach
[56:56] ellsworth and uh that is that the
[56:59] evidently the surgeon has been in
[57:02] and uh it appears that his bowel is
[57:05] perforated
[57:06] and uh there's not really a blockage
[57:09] there like they thought just the
[57:10] inflammation and the infection from the
[57:13] perforated bowel which
[57:15] could have certainly started with the
[57:16] diverticulitis
[57:18] they want to keep him for up to a week
[57:20] and see if they it will get a little
[57:22] better with antibiotics so the surgery
[57:24] isn't as invasive
[57:27] and we know god can heal perforated
[57:29] bowel
[57:30] he's just done it
[57:32] but brother steve curry we know that god
[57:34] can do that
[57:36] and we're just sorry for the pain and
[57:38] and i'm telling you after uh after
[57:41] having to be in the hospital this week
[57:43] he will be ready to get out i can assure
[57:45] you of that but this is serious business
[57:48] you've got to have you've got to have
[57:50] your digestive system in working order
[57:52] and uh
[57:53] i tell you i uh the lord healed me many
[57:56] times but
[57:57] i did make a good decision and i didn't
[57:59] want to do it but i did make a good
[58:00] decision
[58:02] uh some years back and had my sigmoid
[58:05] colon removed and it really took care of
[58:08] a lot of problems so my heart just feels
[58:11] heavy and gold keeps going out to zach
[58:13] all through the night that god would
[58:14] just raise him up and and heal him i
[58:17] think he's mighty young to have to deal
[58:18] with that kind of a problem
[58:20] you that have suffered like that i know
[58:22] sister kathy understands
[58:24] some of those kinds of things and we you
[58:26] know it's not pleasant but god god's got
[58:29] it he's got it and uh liz elizabeth was
[58:33] just saying that they meant to request
[58:35] prayer also for their neighbor derek he
[58:37] is a cabinet builder oh my and he had an
[58:40] accident with a table saw on friday lost
[58:42] a finger and has some other other pretty
[58:45] serious cuts so we want to ask the lord
[58:48] to undertake for him and i would not do
[58:51] this for anybody else
[58:53] because i don't really feel up to
[58:54] singing but i'm i will do this for
[58:57] sister tevo mama because i love her so
[58:59] much she's asking me she's texting in
[59:02] church folks
[59:07] and i happen to see her i'll sing this
[59:08] for her i sure will yes i will
[59:12] it's a it is nothing but the truth that
[59:14] we have a body
[59:16] hallelujah we have another body
[59:20] and one of these days we're going to
[59:22] step into it
[59:24] and we'll keep that one for a while
[59:27] and uh
[59:28] i don't know if it's the new body or not
[59:30] because brother branham seemed to make
[59:32] us think that it was a even that was a
[59:34] temporary thing that there is a
[59:36] glorified a body waiting on us a new
[59:39] body waiting on us after that but but uh
[59:42] that's like a transportation on the way
[59:44] to a completely glorified body i'm
[59:46] looking forward to it let's sing that my

[1:07:41] preaching out that verse i said well you
[1:07:43] could have preached after all
[1:07:45] he was supposed to preach today but he's
[1:07:48] been having coughing a lot of coughing
[1:07:50] and congestion and trying to get through
[1:07:52] that stuff

[1:08:34] so so if you want me to obey the lord i

[1:08:39] but you're going to have to work too
[1:08:41] this is not your day off
[1:08:44] amen
[1:08:46] all right i gave myself a day off
[1:08:48] tuesday night and had brother branham
[1:08:50] preach for us
[1:08:51] not knowing i was going to have to give
[1:08:52] my day off today give it up but that's
[1:08:54] okay
[1:08:55] i don't want brother greenlee i didn't
[1:08:57] want him to do anything that would make
[1:08:58] his condition any worse and sometimes
[1:09:01] you start feeling better you push
[1:09:03] yourself and you can go back and now
[1:09:05] sister joyce has picked that up and uh
[1:09:08] austin i hate to ask you to do well
[1:09:10] joseph let's get him he's closer joseph
[1:09:13] would you come and get my handkerchief
[1:09:14] for me
[1:09:15] uh i forgot about somebody being up here
[1:09:18] on the platform
[1:09:19] you're you're a real fan too you can get
[1:09:21] right in there without moving anything
[1:09:23] thank you so much
[1:09:26] um
[1:09:27] i believe the lord wants to show us some
[1:09:28] things this morning if you've got the
[1:09:30] patience and you've got the pool let's
[1:09:32] see i'm gonna see mark 4 24.
[1:09:45] just a moment
[1:09:48] and he said unto them
[1:09:51] take heed
[1:09:52] what
[1:09:53] you hear
[1:09:56] with what measure
[1:09:58] ye meet
[1:10:00] it shall be measured to you
[1:10:04] and unto you that here
[1:10:07] shall more be given
[1:10:08] i want to read it again
[1:10:10] because this verse is so similar to
[1:10:13] other verses
[1:10:15] your brain may be telling you i'm
[1:10:17] reading something that i'm not reading
[1:10:19] so i want you to listen carefully to
[1:10:21] this verse
[1:10:23] there are other verses similar
[1:10:26] but this is where we are today
[1:10:29] and he said unto them take heed what ye
[1:10:33] hear
[1:10:35] with what measure you meet
[1:10:37] it shall be measured to you and unto you
[1:10:41] that here
[1:10:43] shall more
[1:10:45] be given that sounds so good to me
[1:10:48] a couple years ago when i
[1:10:50] used this verse probably for the first
[1:10:52] time in my ministry had i ever
[1:10:54] spoken using this verse i read it to you
[1:10:59] in the amplified bible i'm going to do
[1:11:01] it again this morning although we're
[1:11:03] going in a different direction today
[1:11:05] than we did a couple years ago i want
[1:11:07] you to hear how it sounds in the
[1:11:10] amplified it's it's really
[1:11:13] really helpful
[1:11:14] and he said to them
[1:11:16] be careful what you are
[1:11:20] hearing
[1:11:22] that's just good advice
[1:11:24] that was good advice 2 000 years ago
[1:11:27] when jesus said it but it's probably
[1:11:29] even greater advice in 2021 when there
[1:11:34] are so many voices speaking today
[1:11:38] everybody's got a blog
[1:11:41] everybody's got a podcast
[1:11:43] come on now
[1:11:45] everybody's getting in on the thing i
[1:11:48] saw an advertisement that said even
[1:11:50] judge judy has got a podcast
[1:11:54] everybody's getting in on the podcast
[1:11:57] people can't stick to what they what
[1:12:00] they do so everybody's trying to be a
[1:12:02] voice in your ear
[1:12:04] and sometimes it's like a bug trapped in
[1:12:07] there just buzzing buzzing buzzing
[1:12:10] buzzing all the time come on now he said
[1:12:13] be careful what you are hearing but this
[1:12:16] is what i like
[1:12:18] the measure
[1:12:19] of thought
[1:12:21] and study
[1:12:24] the measure of thought and study you
[1:12:29] give to the truth you hear
[1:12:33] the measure of thought and study you
[1:12:36] give to the truth you hear will be the
[1:12:39] measure
[1:12:41] of virtue and knowledge that comes back
[1:12:45] to
[1:12:46] you
[1:12:46] [Music]
[1:12:48] now some of us don't hear much
[1:12:51] so we can't really expect a whole lot to
[1:12:53] come back to us
[1:12:55] but the measure of thought and study you
[1:12:58] give to the truth you hear
[1:13:01] will be the measure of virtue and
[1:13:03] knowledge that comes back to you
[1:13:07] and more besides
[1:13:09] will be given to you
[1:13:12] who
[1:13:13] here
[1:13:15] this is not just
[1:13:16] listening this is hearing
[1:13:20] and how important it is
[1:13:23] to hear father we thank you today that
[1:13:25] you have given us grace
[1:13:28] to be here
[1:13:29] and lord when we're feeling a little out
[1:13:32] of sort
[1:13:33] we can really
[1:13:35] appreciate what you do to help us
[1:13:38] and when we're scrambling to try to get
[1:13:40] dressed to get
[1:13:42] uh from the bed to the to the bathroom
[1:13:45] we we really then think about all we
[1:13:48] take for granted and how good you are to
[1:13:51] help us to be mobile to get around and
[1:13:54] to live the life that you've given us to
[1:13:56] live so today it's with gratitude
[1:13:59] that i i approach you to say lord thank
[1:14:02] you for your grace today and every day
[1:14:05] of our lives we are all a very very very
[1:14:09] blessed people and even in our darkest

[1:14:23] lived in the goodness of the lord what a
[1:14:28] place to live not only in the land of

[1:14:36] depending on you
[1:14:38] and i'm also depending on your people to

[1:14:44] all glory and all honor and all praise
[1:14:47] will go to you
[1:14:49] it's in the wonderful name of the lord
[1:14:51] jesus christ we pray and the saints said

[1:15:31] from new brunswick from ghana
[1:15:37] it goes on from where does that say
[1:15:47] you'll have to forgive me takes me
[1:15:50] madagascar wow
[1:15:53] i thought that's what it said but i
[1:15:54] couldn't spread it out to see it all
[1:15:57] god bless you in madagascar
[1:16:01] i've always carried something in my
[1:16:03] heart for madagascar and to think that
[1:16:06] someone is
[1:16:08] watching from that beautiful uh
[1:16:11] long
[1:16:12] island on the coast of africa is a real
[1:16:15] blessing
[1:16:17] uh again new brunswick and
[1:16:19] it goes on and on that's alberta i think
[1:16:22] and others but we just god bless you and
[1:16:24] all of your input and some are sharing
[1:16:27] scriptures of encouragement with us and
[1:16:30] some are mentioning the songs and they
[1:16:32] appreciate the songs
[1:16:34] and they appreciate the liberty
[1:16:37] that they see in the worship well
[1:16:39] as anybody knows
[1:16:41] there's a price to pay to have freedom
[1:16:43] of worship
[1:16:45] you have to break through a lot of stuff
[1:16:47] to get there don't you and you have to
[1:16:49] really be in a place where it's not
[1:16:51] outlawed and i'm so thankful this
[1:16:53] morning we may have many people
[1:16:55] traveling there may be many out sick but
[1:16:58] i'm still thankful for the atmosphere of
[1:17:00] this house and i'm still thankful that
[1:17:03] we have understood that praise and
[1:17:06] worship and prayer can get a whole lot
[1:17:08] accomplished
[1:17:10] amen so today i want to take you just a
[1:17:12] little bit further i thought that i
[1:17:15] would move into something else but
[1:17:18] i want to go back in order to go forward
[1:17:21] we have covered
[1:17:22] six of the seven offices of the holy
[1:17:25] spirit number six being the spirit of
[1:17:28] supplication
[1:17:30] but i found a tremendous and if you're
[1:17:32] already having struggles staying awake
[1:17:34] you're going to need to slip out and
[1:17:36] wash your face this morning you're going
[1:17:37] to need to go ahead and get that fixed
[1:17:39] up before we go on
[1:17:41] um
[1:17:42] i thought i had covered that and i would
[1:17:44] move on to the spirit of glory but
[1:17:47] i found some notes that i had made i
[1:17:49] wasn't much feeling like making notes
[1:17:52] so when you get on a roll you better go
[1:17:54] with it
[1:17:56] and i have done that many many many
[1:17:58] times and if jesus
[1:17:59] carries and i go home i'm going to leave
[1:18:01] all these for somebody to preach because
[1:18:04] i have hundreds of pages
[1:18:07] and i'm thankful for that in times like
[1:18:09] this but i wasn't expecting to find this
[1:18:11] section
[1:18:12] and i tried to talk myself out of it and
[1:18:14] i said well a lot of folks are traveling
[1:18:17] and and so but i believe the lord wants
[1:18:19] me to get there this morning so i gotta
[1:18:21] hurry and give you a quick review
[1:18:24] so that we can get over to this place
[1:18:27] where i want to be today and zachariah
[1:18:30] chapter 12 and verse 10
[1:18:32] we spent some weeks
[1:18:34] studying on the offices
[1:18:37] of the holy spirit i don't really like
[1:18:40] that term offices but i i didn't i just
[1:18:44] really couldn't find anything that i
[1:18:47] felt like covered it anymore but you
[1:18:50] might say administrations
[1:18:52] there are many many many ways the holy
[1:18:55] ghost works in our life
[1:18:56] i mean hundreds of ways i don't think
[1:18:59] that's an exaggeration
[1:19:01] but they fall under some headings
[1:19:05] and that's what i have done in this
[1:19:07] study was find
[1:19:09] seven headings
[1:19:11] and seven places in the bible where
[1:19:14] particular spirits
[1:19:16] are mentioned the spirit of
[1:19:19] life the spirit of truth
[1:19:22] the spirit of adoption the spirit of
[1:19:26] holiness the spirit of grace the spirit
[1:19:30] of supplication
[1:19:31] and the spirit of glory
[1:19:33] if you've got that graphic there uh
[1:19:36] where we where we break down and this
[1:19:39] this is a review
[1:19:40] but some of you weren't here for the
[1:19:42] study
[1:19:43] number one the spirit of life
[1:19:45] and that is found throughout the bible
[1:19:48] go back onto the app you can find the
[1:19:51] sermons we did on the spirit of life the
[1:19:53] scriptures will be there the quotes from
[1:19:56] brother branham will be there and you
[1:19:58] can just do a bible study a refreshers
[1:20:00] course but the spirit of life creates
[1:20:04] or recreates god's divine
[1:20:08] life in us
[1:20:10] and then we study the spirit of truth
[1:20:13] which brings us to a more perfect
[1:20:16] revelation of god an understanding of
[1:20:20] god that is more complete than anything
[1:20:24] we ever experienced in denominational
[1:20:26] christianity and it takes the spirit of
[1:20:30] god to unveil god
[1:20:32] it takes the spirit of god to unveil
[1:20:34] jesus christ and so i i am not a
[1:20:38] branhamite
[1:20:40] i am a son of the living god
[1:20:43] but i am not ashamed to say that i have
[1:20:47] recognized a ministry sent from god to
[1:20:51] help me understand who god is
[1:20:55] i'm telling you and that's just the why
[1:20:57] that's just the raken and scratches the
[1:20:59] baseline there's just so much more piled
[1:21:02] on top of that that we can understand by
[1:21:05] revelation because of the spirit of
[1:21:09] truth operating in a ministry like that
[1:21:12] but you can't depend on brother branham
[1:21:14] you've got to depend on the holy ghost
[1:21:16] in you
[1:21:18] to bring the spirit of truth to take you
[1:21:20] because you can hear the message that he
[1:21:23] brought and get nothing but some little
[1:21:25] surface level but but the bride when she
[1:21:28] hears it under the inspiration like we
[1:21:31] did here why i've heard that sermon
[1:21:34] preached that sermon listened to that
[1:21:35] sermon hundreds of times but in
[1:21:38] listening to it tuesday night i found
[1:21:40] three things that stood out to me that
[1:21:43] had never stood out to me before and we
[1:21:46] only heard half the message and so this
[1:21:48] is how the spirit of truth operates he
[1:21:51] keeps on revealing the word to us and we
[1:21:55] have an absolute and that's the word of
[1:21:57] god and we have a glorious absolute
[1:22:00] interpretation of the scripture and
[1:22:02] that's the message of the hour but one
[1:22:05] you take that that message of the hour
[1:22:07] and we have to tail it it just dawned on
[1:22:10] me that someone asked the question
[1:22:14] uh about the chinese laundry because i
[1:22:17] just just said that real quick like and
[1:22:20] didn't explain it and i guess on a
[1:22:22] stream it might not but brother branham
[1:22:24] would tell these stories about the
[1:22:26] chinese immigrants and how they operated
[1:22:29] these laundromats and cleaners they
[1:22:32] couldn't write english they could only
[1:22:35] write chinese so what they would do they
[1:22:38] couldn't read they couldn't they
[1:22:39] couldn't read english so they would get
[1:22:41] the person perhaps to put their name on
[1:22:44] the on the paper but they couldn't read
[1:22:46] what was there so they would take the
[1:22:48] ticket and tear it
[1:22:50] jagged like you know how you do when you
[1:22:53] tear tear a piece of paper they would
[1:22:55] tear it jagged so that they would give
[1:22:58] half to the customer and they would keep
[1:23:00] half and when they come to pick up their
[1:23:02] laundry they would bring their ticket
[1:23:05] and they couldn't read what was on it
[1:23:06] but they could take the ticket of the
[1:23:08] customer and set it there against their
[1:23:11] piece of the ticket and guess what it
[1:23:13] dovetailed and they said oh we're giving
[1:23:15] the right clothes to the right people
[1:23:18] and so brother brandon then in a
[1:23:19] dovetail you know that's in that's in
[1:23:21] furniture construction and how the old
[1:23:24] pioneers and you can ask r.j about that
[1:23:26] he knows how to do that and you take
[1:23:29] that wood and cut it and make those
[1:23:31] dovetails and then it you you cut the
[1:23:34] wood out to receive that dovetail i want
[1:23:36] you to know you've got one of the finest
[1:23:38] joints that can be made in furniture
[1:23:41] making and when you're going around
[1:23:43] buying antiques you find one that's
[1:23:45] dovetailed like that you've got
[1:23:47] something you've got a piece of real
[1:23:49] furniture and so brother branham talks
[1:23:51] about the message of the hour he said
[1:23:53] don't take my word for it
[1:23:56] what you hear me say in here you take
[1:23:58] that and put that up against the word of
[1:24:00] god and see if that won't dovetail with
[1:24:03] that word and then you've got a sure
[1:24:06] foundation to stand on now you can't get
[1:24:08] any fairer than that folks
[1:24:11] that's not a man saying you take my word
[1:24:13] for it no matter what the book said
[1:24:15] that's as fair as it gets and i feel the
[1:24:18] same way you take what you hear right
[1:24:20] back to the word and see if it fits so
[1:24:24] then the holy ghost works in our life as
[1:24:26] the spirit of adoption
[1:24:28] and that that means he is working
[1:24:31] patiently in us until we can be called
[1:24:35] the sons of knowledge or mature sons i
[1:24:38] want you to know maturity is what we're
[1:24:41] after because it's only in maturity that
[1:24:44] we're going to be christ-liked
[1:24:46] down here is a bunch of little babies we
[1:24:49] can't be christ-like we can't hardly
[1:24:51] live the christ life but as we allow him
[1:24:54] to mature us i'll just be honest with
[1:24:57] you one of the ways he does that we just
[1:24:59] read it in our opening uh text just a
[1:25:03] moment ago about listening being careful
[1:25:06] what you hear and how much study and how
[1:25:09] much you revisit that word of truth that
[1:25:13] is the measure by which you receive
[1:25:16] understanding of what you have heard
[1:25:18] that makes me want to put a little
[1:25:19] effort in the preaching that i hear
[1:25:22] then number four the spirit of holiness
[1:25:25] it causes our relationship to grow
[1:25:28] into the realization and revelation of
[1:25:31] his holiness the spirit of holiness does
[1:25:35] not try to show us how we can be more
[1:25:37] holy it tries to show us how we can
[1:25:40] yield more to his holiness and that
[1:25:43] makes us holy do you follow that all
[1:25:46] right you're getting slack
[1:25:50] now the final three that's the first
[1:25:53] four and they reveal his work in
[1:25:55] creating the divine life of god in us
[1:25:59] the last three reveal his power his
[1:26:03] divine power
[1:26:04] as he governs our lives to fully develop
[1:26:09] his character
[1:26:11] in his bride church the last three
[1:26:15] offices reveal his divine power as he
[1:26:18] governs our lives to fully develop his
[1:26:22] character in his bride church
[1:26:25] they reveal his power to govern our life
[1:26:29] so he can fulfill
[1:26:32] all the purposes of god in us
[1:26:35] individually as well as corporately in
[1:26:38] the church do you follow that so number
[1:26:41] four excuse me number five was the
[1:26:43] spirit of grace or the first of the
[1:26:46] final three the spirit of grace it
[1:26:48] governs the attitudes and actions of the
[1:26:52] believer who has learned to walk
[1:26:54] independence on the holy spirit i don't
[1:26:57] know about you but i need this one a lot
[1:27:00] lots lots lots
[1:27:02] and then we came to the spirit of
[1:27:04] supplication and the the the work of
[1:27:07] that spirit in our life it's all the
[1:27:10] holy spirit but the work of the spirit
[1:27:12] of supplication in our life executes the
[1:27:15] office of prayer governing the
[1:27:18] communication between our spirit and god
[1:27:22] and brother sister this is so important
[1:27:25] that we keep a clean line between heaven
[1:27:28] and us
[1:27:30] all dead cats off the line when you get
[1:27:33] down to where zachary has been
[1:27:36] uh last night yesterday evening you
[1:27:38] don't want to have to get right with
[1:27:40] folks
[1:27:43] you don't even want to have to get right
[1:27:45] with god
[1:27:46] you want to just be able to call on the
[1:27:48] lord and know that there's nothing
[1:27:50] between you and him he hears you
[1:27:53] and he is moving on your behalf
[1:27:56] and so it's a good idea to keep
[1:27:58] everything clean i remember my
[1:28:01] grandmother telling about how her
[1:28:03] daughter
[1:28:04] my aunt who passed away a couple years
[1:28:07] back fell dead at her feet with
[1:28:09] rheumatic fever and she said i was so
[1:28:12] thankful that in that moment i didn't
[1:28:14] have to go into repenting before the
[1:28:16] lord or calling anybody on the phone to
[1:28:19] ask them to forgive me i had kept every
[1:28:22] one of my accounts in order with god
[1:28:25] with man and then all i had to do was
[1:28:28] just say oh jesus help me and help my
[1:28:31] daughter and i'm very glad to say that
[1:28:33] that that worked that god did that
[1:28:36] prayer is a very important part of the
[1:28:39] life of a christian and we need both the
[1:28:42] spirit of grace and the spirit of
[1:28:44] supplication operating in our lives in
[1:28:47] zechariah chapter 12 and verse 10 he
[1:28:51] said and i will pour upon the house of
[1:28:54] david and upon the inhabitants of
[1:28:57] jerusalem the spirit of grace and of
[1:29:00] supplication and they shall look upon me
[1:29:03] whom they have pierced and they shall
[1:29:05] mourn for him as one morning for his
[1:29:08] only son and shall be in bitterness for
[1:29:11] him as one that is in bitterness or we
[1:29:15] could say grief for his firstborn i
[1:29:18] don't think i gave them these two verses
[1:29:21] but maybe they can pull them anyway in
[1:29:23] daniel chapter 9 verse 3 i don't know if
[1:29:26] you remember or not but daniel was a man
[1:29:29] of prayer
[1:29:30] daniel was a man who had prayer as a
[1:29:34] part of his dna
[1:29:36] and any time anywhere under all
[1:29:39] circumstances he knew that there was
[1:29:41] power in prayer and in chapter 9 and
[1:29:44] verse 3 daniel said and i set my face
[1:29:49] unto the lord god to seek by prayer and
[1:29:53] supplications with fasting and sackcloth
[1:29:57] and ashes i don't know how you feel
[1:29:59] about that but my assessment is daniel
[1:30:02] was serious about his prayer
[1:30:05] and then in chapter 9 daniel 9 and verse
[1:30:08] 17 and i've already read these verses
[1:30:11] with you uh oh a month or so back now
[1:30:14] now therefore
[1:30:15] oh our god
[1:30:17] hear the prayer of thy servant and his
[1:30:21] supplications and cause thy face to
[1:30:26] shine upon thy sanctuary that is
[1:30:29] desolate for the lord's sake
[1:30:32] we talked about what is a supplication
[1:30:35] it is a need
[1:30:37] it is an entreaty a plea for mercy a
[1:30:42] petition
[1:30:44] it is a
[1:30:45] serious request for the favor of god to
[1:30:50] fall in your life
[1:30:52] when we are anointed to pray when we are
[1:30:56] filled with the spirit of supplication
[1:30:58] then we're not praying according to our
[1:31:00] wants and our wishes and our desires but
[1:31:04] we are praying in the spirit and i
[1:31:07] i want you to know as we talked about
[1:31:10] some time back you can pray in the
[1:31:12] spirit in both english and in an unknown
[1:31:16] tongue praying in the spirit doesn't
[1:31:18] mean always praying in tongues it means
[1:31:21] either praying in english or praying in
[1:31:24] tongues but i encourage you
[1:31:27] to operate what god has placed in you
[1:31:31] when he placed in you the holy ghost and
[1:31:33] that is to come to a place where you are
[1:31:37] so yielded to the spirit of god in
[1:31:40] prayer that he prays
[1:31:43] through you
[1:31:44] you're no longer doing the work but he
[1:31:47] is praying through you
[1:31:49] in a wonderful way i wasn't going to
[1:31:52] read that this morning so i didn't turn
[1:31:54] it in but let me find that verse just
[1:31:57] for the record let me read that to you
[1:32:00] just a moment here
[1:32:02] uh i have gone through and highlighted
[1:32:05] what i wanted to talk about today but in
[1:32:08] uh in romans chapter 8
[1:32:11] and verse 26
[1:32:13] and 27
[1:32:15] he said likewise the spirit and i would
[1:32:18] say this is part of the working of the
[1:32:20] spirit of supplication in our life
[1:32:23] likewise the spirit also helpeth our
[1:32:27] infirmities
[1:32:28] for we know not what we should pray for
[1:32:31] as we ought but the spirit
[1:32:34] itself
[1:32:36] that is the kind of prayer the bride
[1:32:39] must be involved in in the last days the
[1:32:42] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[1:32:47] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[1:32:50] and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth
[1:32:54] what is in the mind of the spirit
[1:32:58] because he maketh intercession for the
[1:33:00] saints according to the will of god
[1:33:04] that's why spirit prayer prayer in the
[1:33:07] spirit
[1:33:08] is such an important part of the
[1:33:10] christian life because we know when the
[1:33:12] spirit is praying either in english or
[1:33:16] in tongues when the spirit is praying i
[1:33:19] want you to know this is not totally
[1:33:21] fair for some of you because you only
[1:33:23] pray in church
[1:33:27] well this isn't going to mean a whole
[1:33:29] lot to you
[1:33:30] but you that have adopted prayer as your
[1:33:33] privilege
[1:33:34] and your responsibility
[1:33:36] you're praying every day
[1:33:38] and that doesn't mean you're getting
[1:33:39] down on every time on your knees
[1:33:42] it means you are making sure to call on
[1:33:45] the lord because every time you do your
[1:33:48] spirit connects with his
[1:33:50] and there's a communication that takes
[1:33:53] place that's out of this world
[1:33:55] it's out of this world there's nothing
[1:33:57] in this world that can compare with that
[1:34:00] kind of communication direct
[1:34:02] communication between god now when we
[1:34:05] taught this and began studying this then
[1:34:07] we looked at the tripartite man and we
[1:34:10] don't have time to do that today but let
[1:34:12] me just say that the spirit of
[1:34:14] supplication comes to establish us in a
[1:34:18] prayer relationship with god so that we
[1:34:21] can commune freely with him and there's
[1:34:24] going to be times that you approach him
[1:34:27] as one of his sons but in the flesh
[1:34:31] in your own mind you feel you need to
[1:34:33] pray and you begin to pray you think
[1:34:35] about prayer and you pray there's
[1:34:38] nothing wrong with that because if
[1:34:39] you've kept a good communication line
[1:34:42] open you start praying after your own
[1:34:44] thoughts and the holy spirit
[1:34:46] takes over
[1:34:49] he takes over and he begins to do the
[1:34:52] praying for us
[1:34:53] and through us and my what a blessing
[1:34:56] that is communion with god isn't just it
[1:35:00] doesn't just mean saying a prayer at
[1:35:02] certain times it involves living a life
[1:35:04] of prayer and without the holy ghost
[1:35:07] that's nearly impossible prayer does not
[1:35:09] have to be time spent in your closet
[1:35:11] although i can't emphasize enough the
[1:35:13] importance of quietly waiting on god but
[1:35:17] prayer can happen anywhere you are
[1:35:20] prayer simply put is talking with god
[1:35:22] whether it be in the spirit or in the
[1:35:25] understanding talking with god is how
[1:35:27] your relationship with him is built
[1:35:30] stronger are you listening here
[1:35:32] prayer is talking to god even when we
[1:35:35] can't talk out loud my spirit can talk
[1:35:38] to god at any time and in any place
[1:35:42] doesn't have to be vocally we've got to
[1:35:44] learn to cultivate a spirit of prayer as
[1:35:47] we live our lives in ordinary daily
[1:35:50] situations we must learn to yield to the
[1:35:53] spirit of supplication and he will bring
[1:35:56] us into vital relationship with holy
[1:36:00] spirit remember this
[1:36:03] god is
[1:36:04] excuse me
[1:36:06] i want to read it exactly like it was
[1:36:08] written remember this
[1:36:10] to the degree that god is on your mind
[1:36:14] coming up out of your spirit
[1:36:17] controlling your thoughts
[1:36:19] is to the degree
[1:36:21] that god is working in your life
[1:36:25] i don't think you heard that
[1:36:28] let's do it again
[1:36:29] to the degree that god is on your mind
[1:36:32] coming up out of your spirit how often
[1:36:35] is god even on your mind
[1:36:41] i don't want to start into that
[1:36:48] some of you are a lot more connected to
[1:36:50] instagram
[1:36:52] and you are to holy spirit
[1:36:54] that's not to condemn you that's to tell
[1:36:57] you that
[1:36:58] right around the corner
[1:37:00] all of that is not going to mean a thing
[1:37:02] because you won't be able to feed your
[1:37:04] family by instagram no
[1:37:07] if that's going to be the source of all
[1:37:08] your information people use it for their
[1:37:11] news they use it for their little canned
[1:37:13] spirituality
[1:37:15] they get their little little thought
[1:37:16] quotes you know and they present that
[1:37:18] and they use that and they present
[1:37:20] really it makes people hypocrites a lot
[1:37:23] of the time it makes them causes them to
[1:37:25] present something about themselves it's
[1:37:27] just not the way it really is
[1:37:30] we have known people in the past
[1:37:33] and uh we're just thinking about some of
[1:37:35] them the other day we've known people in
[1:37:37] the past that
[1:37:38] the only room that they kept with any
[1:37:40] kind of neatness at all was the first
[1:37:42] room of the house if you move past the
[1:37:44] first room you saw the filth that they
[1:37:46] really were living in we had a preacher
[1:37:49] here one time who who loved gotti he
[1:37:51] loved gaudy he and his wife they just
[1:37:54] were very colorful
[1:37:55] a little bit extravagant kind of people
[1:37:58] and they like to have gold uh paint and
[1:38:02] everything just really really really
[1:38:03] really nice and that was wonderful as
[1:38:05] long as you're only in two or three
[1:38:06] rooms
[1:38:07] but when you got down to how they really
[1:38:09] live where their kids slept
[1:38:12] that's when you found the piles of dirty
[1:38:14] diapers
[1:38:15] that's when you found the hot dogs that
[1:38:16] had dried up and thrown been thrown in
[1:38:19] the corner and left there so you see
[1:38:21] that kind of a that kind of a spirit
[1:38:23] existed before social media
[1:38:27] but social media just gives us a way of
[1:38:29] being able to fix one corner of the room
[1:38:33] and not show what's really going on in
[1:38:34] our life
[1:38:35] so i'm telling you what prayer has got
[1:38:38] to be more important than any other
[1:38:40] thing in your existence any other thing
[1:38:43] in your existence it has to be i'm not
[1:38:46] against social media i use it every day
[1:38:48] i'm going to use it as long as they let
[1:38:50] me use it
[1:38:51] i'm going to use it because i understand
[1:38:53] that it's a powerful tool to witness to
[1:38:56] speak to people that you would not have
[1:38:58] an opportunity to speak to them about do
[1:39:01] it in truth tell them the truth they
[1:39:03] don't need to hear what they need to
[1:39:05] hear what they want to hear i mean they
[1:39:07] don't need to hear what they want to
[1:39:08] hear they need to hear what they need to
[1:39:10] hear and i'm not talking about vaccines
[1:39:13] because you're wasting your time
[1:39:16] if you want to witness and share a
[1:39:18] message of truth you ought to do it
[1:39:20] about the things of the kingdom of god
[1:39:22] because you can get your politics right
[1:39:24] and have your attitude toward the
[1:39:26] kingdom keep you out
[1:39:28] hello
[1:39:30] ah my you'll help me now
[1:39:34] to keep me off of any of that
[1:39:36] to the degree god is on your mind
[1:39:39] coming up out of your spirit
[1:39:42] controlling your thoughts is the degree
[1:39:45] that it is to the same degree that he is
[1:39:48] working in your life so if your thought
[1:39:52] life is not being overrode overridden
[1:39:56] overwritten
[1:39:58] by the spirit of god if you're not
[1:40:00] allowing the spirit of god to help you
[1:40:02] correct your thought life if you're not
[1:40:04] allowing the spirit of god to come up
[1:40:06] out of your life bring you into a place
[1:40:09] of prayer and worship then i want you to
[1:40:11] know something you're disconnected
[1:40:15] you're disconnected
[1:40:17] god doesn't have any grandchildren
[1:40:20] come on
[1:40:21] this is a pretty serious thing
[1:40:24] in the message believing god
[1:40:27] ephesians 6 18 said praying always
[1:40:32] with all prayer and supplication in the
[1:40:35] spirit
[1:40:36] and watching there unto with all
[1:40:38] perseverance and supplication for all
[1:40:41] saints
[1:40:42] in the message believing god paragraph
[1:40:44] 107
[1:40:46] brother branham said so therefore that's
[1:40:47] the reason said
[1:40:49] the prayer of faith shall save the sick
[1:40:53] an individual's prayer
[1:40:56] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:40:58] righteous man availeth much
[1:41:02] he said oh if you only knew that in your
[1:41:06] hand
[1:41:07] christ gave us the authority with his
[1:41:12] name
[1:41:13] by being christians the most powerful
[1:41:16] weapon the world has ever known prayer
[1:41:20] it even changes
[1:41:23] what does it change
[1:41:25] it changes
[1:41:27] everything i hope sister tebow can hear
[1:41:30] that
[1:41:31] prayer
[1:41:32] changes
[1:41:33] everything
[1:41:35] he said it'll change the mind of
[1:41:40] god
[1:41:41] it did do it
[1:41:44] after death was pronounced to a man he
[1:41:47] prayed god told the prophet go back and
[1:41:51] tell him i have heard him
[1:41:55] in the message expectation
[1:41:58] he said prayer is the key
[1:42:00] he said that's the answer
[1:42:03] prayer changes things prayer is the most
[1:42:06] powerful weapon that was ever put in the
[1:42:08] control of human beings you've got
[1:42:12] control of the most powerful weapon ever
[1:42:14] created prayer and we won't use it
[1:42:20] we can't get away from the tv long
[1:42:22] enough
[1:42:23] to use it
[1:42:25] and we hold the greatest power the world
[1:42:29] has ever known we hold the authority to
[1:42:30] use that anytime we need to it's in our
[1:42:33] hands
[1:42:35] most powerful weapon ever put in the
[1:42:37] control of human beings he said there's
[1:42:40] no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb as
[1:42:42] powerful as prayer prayer will change
[1:42:45] the mind of god did you know this
[1:42:48] or did you know that he said it he it
[1:42:51] did it
[1:42:52] one time
[1:42:53] and in the message expectation paragraph
[1:42:56] 11 same sermon he goes on to explain
[1:43:00] that it happened in the life when
[1:43:03] hezekiah was told by isaiah the prophet
[1:43:06] and he goes on so you can go back and
[1:43:08] look at that a little bit later
[1:43:10] paragraph 11.
[1:43:12] now
[1:43:13] in uh
[1:43:15] in proverbs chapter 20 we're going to
[1:43:18] get into what i wanted to talk about
[1:43:20] today
[1:43:21] in proverbs chapter 20 verse 27
[1:43:24] it said the spirit
[1:43:26] of of man the spirit of man
[1:43:30] is the candle of the lord
[1:43:33] searching all
[1:43:35] the inward parts
[1:43:37] of the belly
[1:43:39] the spirit of the lord
[1:43:41] is excuse me excuse me the spirit of man
[1:43:46] is the candle of the lord
[1:43:49] searching all the inward parts of the
[1:43:50] belly what in the world does that mean
[1:43:52] let's look at it in the amplified he
[1:43:55] said the spirit of man
[1:43:57] that factor
[1:43:59] in human personality
[1:44:02] which proceeds immediately from god
[1:44:06] is the lamp of the lord
[1:44:08] searching all his inner most
[1:44:12] parts
[1:44:14] the spirit of man
[1:44:16] that factor in human personality which
[1:44:18] perceives immediately from god is the
[1:44:21] lamp of the lord searching all the
[1:44:23] innermost parts he operates in our
[1:44:26] spirit
[1:44:28] he uses our spirit as a torch as a
[1:44:31] candle as a lamp
[1:44:33] to search every other part of who we are
[1:44:37] we preach by the word that the spirit
[1:44:39] and this is what brother branham said in
[1:44:41] the message we listened to tuesday night
[1:44:43] the greatest battle ever fought he
[1:44:45] explained to us in that message that the
[1:44:47] spirit was the inside of the inside
[1:44:50] and god wait a minute i'm waiting on you
[1:44:52] to wake up folks
[1:44:56] i'm going to wait on you just a little

[1:45:35] who can come and lead us in jumping
[1:45:36] jacks

[1:45:40] what do we need to do then
[1:45:43] flow our arms around

[1:45:49] chair i don't get sleepy in church i'm
[1:45:50] too busy but i get sleepy when i'm
[1:45:53] sitting in my chair come on

[1:46:07] appreciate every bit of tithe you pay

[1:46:11] half of it but you don't pay me enough
[1:46:15] to drag you to god's word on a sunday
[1:46:17] morning while you sleep
[1:46:19] when i felt like being at home today
[1:46:22] no no no no no and when people are over
[1:46:23] like this that's sleep folks that is
[1:46:26] sleep
[1:46:27] you're not checking your eyelids for
[1:46:29] cracks then
[1:46:30] somebody said where's this in the
[1:46:32] message where's in the scripture listen
[1:46:33] the pastor is the authority of the
[1:46:35] church
[1:46:36] and i'm telling you that in a lot of
[1:46:38] love and respect i am not going to drag
[1:46:40] you this morning tuesday night i might
[1:46:42] be 100 i might feel good no pain in my
[1:46:44] body and i may drag you again but today
[1:46:46] i'm not going to do it you're going to
[1:46:48] help me
[1:46:49] or we're going home
[1:46:51] you in me
[1:46:52] oh you're so mean well i don't want to
[1:46:54] be
[1:46:57] i'm here to try to help you
[1:46:59] i got something i want to share with you
[1:47:01] i don't i think by how how you're
[1:47:03] approaching already i'm not sure you're
[1:47:05] going to make it through the rest
[1:47:07] but i'm going to believe god that you
[1:47:08] will
[1:47:09] i'm going to believe god that you will
[1:47:11] you're ready to sit down now
[1:47:13] okay go ahead
[1:47:15] we've got to learn to yield to the
[1:47:17] spirit of supplication
[1:47:19] it's part of what will bring us into a
[1:47:21] vital relationship with god
[1:47:23] god communicates through his words
[1:47:27] we communicate through
[1:47:30] how do we communicate
[1:47:33] let me let me say it again god
[1:47:35] communicates through words
[1:47:38] how do we communicate
[1:47:40] through words we absolutely do words are
[1:47:44] thought carriers
[1:47:46] they are you can tell what is on a
[1:47:48] person's heart
[1:47:50] by listening to their words
[1:47:53] you believe that
[1:47:55] i want to get that out we can know the
[1:47:56] father's will
[1:47:58] by knowing the father's words
[1:48:00] brother branham said the will of god is
[1:48:02] revealed
[1:48:03] in god's word and the right
[1:48:05] interpretation
[1:48:07] of the word is revealed by god bringing
[1:48:09] that word to pass
[1:48:11] so father communicates with us
[1:48:14] through written word
[1:48:16] and through rhema word which is inspired
[1:48:20] spirit word
[1:48:22] like some of the exhortation that we
[1:48:24] were hearing this morning we take
[1:48:26] information
[1:48:28] god's holy spirit falls on that
[1:48:30] information and gives us revelation and
[1:48:33] when we have revelation we can then
[1:48:36] apply it
[1:48:37] so information
[1:48:39] revelation
[1:48:40] application there's a process there's a
[1:48:43] process
[1:48:45] you have power in the realm in which you
[1:48:48] live you are a spirit and you have
[1:48:52] dominion in the spirit realm as well as
[1:48:55] in the natural realm
[1:48:57] but you got to live in that realm you've
[1:49:00] got to make a choice i'm not going to
[1:49:02] live my whole life in the natural
[1:49:06] i'm going to live my life also in the
[1:49:09] spiritual realm
[1:49:10] amen i want you to watch your spirit
[1:49:15] effective communication is when the
[1:49:18] message
[1:49:19] conveyed by the sender
[1:49:22] is understood by the receiver in exactly
[1:49:25] the same way as it is intended i'm
[1:49:28] getting to something
[1:49:29] i'm getting to something the enemy is
[1:49:32] the master
[1:49:34] of poor communication
[1:49:36] see i can tell because i picked up a
[1:49:38] spirit on a man and his wife here the
[1:49:40] wife first and just and then the man
[1:49:42] later in this service this morning and i
[1:49:44] know that in order for that to happen
[1:49:46] there had to be a misunderstanding of
[1:49:49] what was being said
[1:49:51] because there was nothing being said
[1:49:53] that should cause someone to respond in
[1:49:55] a bad spirit it ought to be your desire
[1:49:59] to create an atmosphere this morning
[1:50:02] that god's word could go for and you
[1:50:04] ought to be fighting with me
[1:50:07] not against me
[1:50:08] but with me because we're in this fight
[1:50:11] together so i want you to know that one
[1:50:13] of the ways the enemy operates in the
[1:50:15] last hour is by breaking down
[1:50:17] communication
[1:50:19] when people think wrong
[1:50:22] they believe wrong and when people
[1:50:24] believe wrong
[1:50:28] somebody said it over here
[1:50:30] they act wrong when you think wrong you
[1:50:32] believe wrong when you believe wrong
[1:50:35] you're at wrong
[1:50:37] look at what proverbs 23 7 said we're
[1:50:39] going to get somewhere
[1:50:41] proverbs 23 7 said for as he thinketh in
[1:50:45] his heart
[1:50:52] so is he
[1:50:54] eat and drink
[1:50:56] saith he to thee
[1:50:57] but his heart is not
[1:51:00] with thee
[1:51:03] you you might not know by what he says
[1:51:06] that his heart is not with you
[1:51:09] because sometimes he says the right
[1:51:10] things
[1:51:12] but he pulls in another direction
[1:51:15] we got some of that around here
[1:51:17] we need god to help us deal with it as a
[1:51:20] man thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:51:23] eat and drink saith he to thee
[1:51:26] but his heart is not with thee that word
[1:51:29] thinketh
[1:51:30] for as he thinketh it means to calculate
[1:51:33] it means to reckon
[1:51:35] it means to split or to open up
[1:51:38] something now this is not just a casual
[1:51:40] thought here
[1:51:42] this is as a man really thinks in his
[1:51:44] heart what's really going on in his
[1:51:47] thought process whatever that is that's
[1:51:50] who he
[1:51:52] really is
[1:51:54] right so we can't change who we are
[1:51:58] by changing our environment
[1:52:00] but we can change who we are by changing
[1:52:03] our thoughts
[1:52:05] now you're helping me just a moment
[1:52:06] thank you
[1:52:08] everything starts with a thought
[1:52:11] everything starts with a thought
[1:52:13] remember this to the degree that god is
[1:52:16] on your mind
[1:52:18] you heard this
[1:52:19] coming up out of your spirit
[1:52:22] controlling your thoughts is to the
[1:52:24] degree that god is working in your life
[1:52:26] your life will never change
[1:52:28] automatically
[1:52:31] how many of you'd like some change in
[1:52:32] your life don't don't don't say you do
[1:52:34] if you don't
[1:52:35] how many of you like some change in your
[1:52:37] life but don't sit there and act like
[1:52:38] you've got it all together
[1:52:41] oh you'd be a lot more help to us if you
[1:52:43] did
[1:52:46] it won't change by itself
[1:52:50] it don't change automatically
[1:52:52] how many of you found out vacation don't
[1:52:54] change your life
[1:52:59] changes your you know it helps
[1:53:02] oh
[1:53:03] don't don't misunderstand me it helps
[1:53:07] but it don't change your life
[1:53:10] come on
[1:53:11] a new job don't change your life
[1:53:14] oh that was life-changing
[1:53:17] oh that was so life-changing i went to
[1:53:19] this conference
[1:53:20] and it was so life-changing
[1:53:23] did you know the converse didn't change
[1:53:25] you
[1:53:26] if you changed it all you changed your
[1:53:29] thoughts
[1:53:31] if you changed your thoughts you changed
[1:53:33] your life
[1:53:34] if something caused you to think
[1:53:36] differently your life was affected by
[1:53:38] that that's that's where change listen
[1:53:42] changing your thoughts is the very key
[1:53:45] to all change
[1:53:47] there is no change possible without the
[1:53:50] changing of our thoughts
[1:53:52] if your mind don't change your life
[1:53:54] won't change
[1:53:55] are you helping me
[1:53:57] change your mind change your words
[1:54:00] change your words you change your life
[1:54:03] i can say it 11 dozen different ways
[1:54:05] i've got about 30 different expressions
[1:54:07] here but i'm not reading them all
[1:54:09] watch your thoughts they become your
[1:54:11] actions
[1:54:13] and your actions eventually become the
[1:54:15] way you walk out your destiny
[1:54:17] so what your actions that chose your
[1:54:19] destiny path it was the way you're
[1:54:21] thinking about it
[1:54:23] whether you live your life in the
[1:54:25] permissive will of god or in the perfect
[1:54:28] will of god hinges today
[1:54:31] on how you think
[1:54:34] that's good preaching this is what the
[1:54:37] enemy tries to use against us let me let
[1:54:39] me ask you this
[1:54:41] what causes us to have the mood we have
[1:54:46] you folks don't believe that
[1:54:48] you all said you thought
[1:54:50] i know you don't believe that yes i do
[1:54:53] brother shelley we're good you're one
[1:54:55] one in a million
[1:54:56] because here's what i hear
[1:54:59] i had a rough day today
[1:55:02] i woke up this morning with a lot of
[1:55:03] things go on my mind a lot of things
[1:55:05] going on
[1:55:06] and uh uh it just put me in a bad mood
[1:55:11] i
[1:55:12] went to make my smoothie
[1:55:15] and i forgot to put the lid on good
[1:55:19] so i shot smoothie
[1:55:21] here and yawn
[1:55:25] i had about that much left in the cup
[1:55:28] so i went to work hungry
[1:55:32] i knew if i didn't clean up
[1:55:35] all the mess the ants were going to take
[1:55:37] over my world
[1:55:40] you just put me in a mood
[1:55:43] or maybe it was like me i just made that
[1:55:45] up but i've had it happen
[1:55:47] uh
[1:55:48] maybe it was like me the first first
[1:55:50] night or so of hanukkah there was it a
[1:55:52] sunday yeah
[1:55:53] we had lit the candles and then the kids
[1:55:55] come over was was that a was that a
[1:55:57] volleyball night or something i don't
[1:55:59] remember
[1:56:00] but we had all those hanukkims up on the
[1:56:04] mantle and i thought you know it's just
[1:56:06] making uh we've enjoyed it as a family
[1:56:08] it's making a mess and i know you're
[1:56:09] really not supposed to blow them out but
[1:56:12] i am gonna i'm gonna clean this mess up
[1:56:13] while my wife is gone
[1:56:15] oh lord of mercy did i ever regret it
[1:56:19] i could not get up to this one
[1:56:22] so i stood up in the chair
[1:56:25] to get to this one and i didn't know
[1:56:27] that she had sat on top it's a crystal
[1:56:30] one that my mother had given me but you
[1:56:32] can hardly get candles down in it so she
[1:56:34] had put these little votive
[1:56:36] and i didn't see it i wasn't paying that
[1:56:38] much attention i just wanted to try to
[1:56:40] keep from making a mess
[1:56:42] and i grabbed that
[1:56:44] and i started moving it toward me well
[1:56:46] guess what happened
[1:56:47] it was not the first night because there
[1:56:49] were three there were three so it was
[1:56:51] the second night
[1:56:52] all of them fell right on me
[1:56:56] one went down in the cushion of the
[1:56:58] couch and i could see the flames licking
[1:57:00] up
[1:57:04] and then the other two were full of hot
[1:57:06] wax the wax covered my leather chair the
[1:57:09] floor the coffee table
[1:57:14] that is a real mood buster
[1:57:19] but guess what
[1:57:22] i i said i can't let that change my mood
[1:57:24] thank god the house i said oh thank you
[1:57:27] jesus the house didn't burn down
[1:57:31] it could have burned down
[1:57:33] i took a picture i texted my wife i said
[1:57:36] i sure do have a mess i was still
[1:57:38] working on it scraping on it when she
[1:57:39] got home
[1:57:41] she got the vacuum to help me scrape up
[1:57:43] but listen i just made it i could have
[1:57:44] burnt the house down i could have burnt
[1:57:46] my chair
[1:57:47] i could have burnt my face
[1:57:52] it could really have made my move but i
[1:57:54] decided i'm not going to let that put me
[1:57:56] in a bad mood
[1:57:58] because your moods are not created by
[1:58:02] your circumstances
[1:58:05] your moods are created by your
[1:58:09] thoughts
[1:58:15] as a man
[1:58:17] thanketh in his heart so he is
[1:58:21] you've got to understand the only way to
[1:58:24] change your mood
[1:58:28] people say to me i just can't get glad
[1:58:30] because you want me to get glad
[1:58:33] i can't just forget like nothing ever
[1:58:35] happened i can't just get over that that
[1:58:37] fat change your thoughts
[1:58:40] you'll change your mood
[1:58:43] and your changing of your mood will help
[1:58:45] change your life somebody said this
[1:58:47] don't sound like the word to me it
[1:58:48] sounds so much like the word i'm sorry i
[1:58:51] didn't know it 30 years ago
[1:58:53] it sounds exactly like the word
[1:58:56] exactly like the message
[1:59:00] to think my life will never change it'll
[1:59:02] always be this way
[1:59:06] what kind of mood you think that'll put
[1:59:08] you in
[1:59:10] but changing your thoughts will change
[1:59:12] your mood and that will help change your
[1:59:13] life
[1:59:15] there's something in neuroscience or at
[1:59:17] least neuroscientists
[1:59:19] came up with this uh
[1:59:22] with this term we talk about ants all
[1:59:24] the time automatic negative thoughts but
[1:59:28] there there is a term in neuroscience
[1:59:30] called a negativity bias
[1:59:34] let's say it together negativity
[1:59:37] bias
[1:59:44] i i don't have a good arm for baseball
[1:59:48] but i could throw most anything in reach
[1:59:51] and hit somebody
[1:59:56] this morning
[1:59:59] i could probably do it with a hanky
[2:00:03] who has a negativity bias
[2:00:06] you don't have to be around somebody
[2:00:08] long
[2:00:10] to pick up on the fact
[2:00:12] that their bias
[2:00:15] is negativity
[2:00:17] it's like a prejudice
[2:00:19] it's what a bias is
[2:00:21] i'm not going to ask you because i know
[2:00:22] you've got a bias for trump so i'm not
[2:00:25] gonna ask you about
[2:00:26] biden
[2:00:28] because i know your your personality
[2:00:30] your your uh favorite what you really
[2:00:33] stand for is is president trump this is
[2:00:36] how you look at it so i'm not gonna
[2:00:38] discuss that with you and i'm just using
[2:00:40] that as an example
[2:00:42] but we're talking about a bias
[2:00:44] of negativity
[2:00:48] sometimes racism causes people to have a
[2:00:50] bias
[2:00:53] and sometimes
[2:00:54] uh
[2:00:58] let me see if i can get the right word
[2:01:00] uh reverse that's that's it sometimes
[2:01:03] reverse
[2:01:05] racism
[2:01:07] can
[2:01:08] cause you to have a bias
[2:01:11] so that every news event that happens
[2:01:15] is racial
[2:01:19] you got a
[2:01:20] bias you see racism everywhere you look
[2:01:25] come on now there is racism
[2:01:27] but i don't see it everywhere i look i
[2:01:30] see it in blatant
[2:01:32] flaming reality
[2:01:34] in many places
[2:01:36] but just because
[2:01:38] a white man is accused of a crime or a
[2:01:41] black man is accused of a crime doesn't
[2:01:43] necessarily scream to me
[2:01:46] racism
[2:01:47] or reverse racism
[2:01:49] come on now
[2:01:50] we let a bias and a prejudice sometimes
[2:01:54] uh
[2:01:54] cloud our judgment
[2:01:57] on everything
[2:02:02] now you know that's like uh that's like
[2:02:05] uh women drivers
[2:02:10] i've known some awful ones
[2:02:13] let's see if i can get it stirred up in
[2:02:14] here
[2:02:17] i've known some awful ones
[2:02:20] and it has caused me to struggle a
[2:02:21] little bit with a bias
[2:02:24] i'm not the only one that's how i feel
[2:02:26] so comfortable saying this
[2:02:28] so if i see a woman if i excuse me sorry
[2:02:32] if i see a vehicle up ahead of me doing
[2:02:34] this
[2:02:39] my mind
[2:02:41] see that tobias i got to get work on
[2:02:44] my mind says that's a woman driver right
[2:02:46] there i guarantee you that's a woman
[2:02:48] she's either putting on her lipstick
[2:02:52] or texting
[2:02:55] it's it's backfired on me
[2:03:00] i have pulled up there sometime
[2:03:03] and that woman had a mustache
[2:03:09] sometimes she had a long beard
[2:03:12] i said she's not fooling me
[2:03:18] that's a bias i'm using that as an
[2:03:20] example that is a bias
[2:03:22] just because you see a car running off
[2:03:25] the road
[2:03:26] doesn't mean it's a woman
[2:03:28] doesn't mean it's a black person
[2:03:32] just cause you see a car loaded with
[2:03:34] people doesn't mean it's mexican people
[2:03:39] i'm gonna i'm gonna keep on giving you
[2:03:40] an example that you can relate to
[2:03:44] we get this in our head
[2:03:46] and it don't matter how many men you see
[2:03:49] driving like women i mean driving
[2:03:55] oh terrible got your attention now so
[2:03:57] now i know how to do it
[2:04:01] you you just don't matter you've learned
[2:04:03] better you've seen it's not always a
[2:04:04] woman doing it but somehow there's a
[2:04:06] bias in your mind
[2:04:12] i'm preaching to you
[2:04:16] and so that's what a negativity bias is
[2:04:19] someone who is faster to see the
[2:04:22] negative
[2:04:24] than they are to the positive
[2:04:27] i know folks here
[2:04:29] let me just ask you a question if you
[2:04:31] know in your mind this is how you live
[2:04:34] your life it is easier for you to grab
[2:04:37] the negative than the positive just go
[2:04:39] ahead and hold up your hand let us see
[2:04:40] you
[2:04:43] now we would all have stones to throw
[2:04:46] but the truth is you shouldn't throw
[2:04:48] stone at somebody who's willing to see
[2:04:50] who they are and admit it in front of
[2:04:52] all these folks
[2:04:54] i'm more worried about those of you who
[2:04:55] have a negativity bias and didn't raise
[2:04:58] your hand
[2:05:00] that's the one i'm worried about because
[2:05:02] the one who can't see it
[2:05:05] who can't recognize it who can't admit
[2:05:08] it is the less likely
[2:05:10] the least likely to be able to change it
[2:05:14] they won't even know who you're talking
[2:05:15] about
[2:05:16] there are people that will amen amen
[2:05:20] amen and not even real life issue
[2:05:27] you're the one i'm preaching about
[2:05:38] there is a
[2:05:40] a a great
[2:05:42] brain guy
[2:05:44] who wrote a book
[2:05:47] and he wanted to explain in layman's
[2:05:50] terms he's not a believer
[2:05:52] he wanted to write in layman's terms
[2:05:54] what a negativity bias is
[2:05:57] and he said i don't know how to explain
[2:05:59] it so that everybody can grab it but he
[2:06:02] says i'll try to do it like this someone
[2:06:05] with a negativity bias has velcro in
[2:06:08] their brain
[2:06:11] and they catch
[2:06:13] everything
[2:06:14] that's negative
[2:06:18] someone who has a a positivity
[2:06:22] bias
[2:06:24] is like
[2:06:25] they have teflon in their brain
[2:06:30] and when something negative comes by
[2:06:33] they just swipe it off the pan
[2:06:37] but velcro
[2:06:41] it catches something negative in the
[2:06:43] atmosphere
[2:06:44] are you listening
[2:06:47] it catches something in the atmosphere
[2:06:49] and sticks to it
[2:06:52] the only thing you can do to be
[2:06:55] helped in that regard is to work on that
[2:06:57] negativity bias
[2:06:59] you've got to recognize that that is a
[2:07:01] part of who you have been
[2:07:04] it is not a part of who you are
[2:07:06] and you've got to start reaching for the
[2:07:08] positive and and there's only one
[2:07:10] solution
[2:07:12] and that's gratitude
[2:07:15] seems to me like the world out there
[2:07:16] gets a hold of this but the church can't
[2:07:18] get it
[2:07:19] gratitude is the key
[2:07:22] living a life of thanksgiving
[2:07:25] taking time to thank god for what you
[2:07:28] have starts putting the teflon on your
[2:07:31] brain
[2:07:33] so that the negative thoughts just can
[2:07:35] easily be wiped out of the pan and they
[2:07:38] don't stick to you and start becoming a
[2:07:41] part of who you are we and i'm talking
[2:07:45] about this battle of faith that we're
[2:07:47] living in now
[2:07:48] i'm not just talking about being
[2:07:50] positive so you can be successful and so
[2:07:53] that you can do this and so that you can
[2:07:54] do that and you can attract like-minded
[2:07:57] people i'm talking about so that you can
[2:07:59] win the battle
[2:08:01] the greatest battle ever fought must be
[2:08:04] won
[2:08:05] and you can't win it
[2:08:07] in any other arena but the one that is
[2:08:10] fought in
[2:08:11] and that's the mind
[2:08:13] thoughts create our moods
[2:08:16] we can't just be happy because somebody
[2:08:19] said be happy
[2:08:20] we can't just forgive because somebody
[2:08:23] said forgive
[2:08:24] we can't be filled with enthusiasm just
[2:08:27] because some we can't show interest
[2:08:32] just because somebody said show some
[2:08:33] interest like i did this morning
[2:08:36] but what we can do is make steps in the
[2:08:39] right direction
[2:08:42] by making sure that when those negative
[2:08:45] thoughts stick to us it's like i'm going
[2:08:47] to tell you something about certain
[2:08:48] cacti in tucson you can't get anywhere
[2:08:51] near them
[2:08:55] a teddy bear
[2:08:56] you can't get anywhere near them because
[2:08:59] their tips are sharper than your eyes
[2:09:02] can perceive they don't jump
[2:09:06] they're only called jumping but they
[2:09:09] don't jump
[2:09:10] the needles are sometimes sharper than
[2:09:13] what you can see your eye is focusing on
[2:09:17] something way down the needle
[2:09:20] you think you have gotten to the tip so
[2:09:22] you're only gonna first of all what
[2:09:24] makes us do this
[2:09:27] it's the same thing that makes a child
[2:09:29] put their hand on the stove after you've
[2:09:30] told them it's hot i got to see her
[2:09:32] myself it's the same thing that makes
[2:09:34] folks stick their tongue to a flagpole
[2:09:37] on a frozen day
[2:09:40] it's that's that's what that's what
[2:09:42] makes us see how close we can get to
[2:09:44] that
[2:09:47] without
[2:09:48] getting us but what we don't realize is
[2:09:50] your eyes can't perceive the sharpness
[2:09:52] of it and before you have ever reached
[2:09:54] what you see
[2:09:55] it has stuck you
[2:09:57] so they call it a jumping cactus it's
[2:10:00] not jumping it's not moving you're the
[2:10:02] one moving toward it but it gets you
[2:10:04] before you can see it
[2:10:06] there's something about these kinds of
[2:10:08] thoughts
[2:10:09] those negative thoughts that hang around
[2:10:13] us that we are trying maybe to do
[2:10:16] something about them but before we do
[2:10:17] they get us
[2:10:19] because we've entertained them too long
[2:10:21] that is because we have a negativity
[2:10:23] bias
[2:10:24] that's because we're actually biased
[2:10:26] toward negative things folks
[2:10:30] facebook will tell you that you just cut
[2:10:33] all these people out of your life
[2:10:37] i've been i've read it i've read where
[2:10:39] preachers have posted it i've been
[2:10:40] tempted to post it myself
[2:10:45] life is too short
[2:10:47] they'll say on there life is too short
[2:10:49] to deal with people that drain all your
[2:10:51] life out of you
[2:10:53] or life is too short to deal with people
[2:10:55] who are negative all the time and when
[2:10:57] you leave them that is what facebook
[2:11:00] will tell you to do you can't do that
[2:11:04] you can't handle a situation by just
[2:11:07] completely cutting people out of your
[2:11:08] life especially those that god has put
[2:11:11] in your life
[2:11:14] you read that and you say how i'm going
[2:11:15] to do that that's part of my family
[2:11:19] now you can choose who you spend the
[2:11:21] most time with that is absolutely right
[2:11:24] but you just can't cut people out
[2:11:26] without any concern for who they are and
[2:11:28] how they're connected to you because
[2:11:30] they're negative what you've got to do
[2:11:32] is become so filled with faith
[2:11:35] so full of gratitude that you are a a
[2:11:39] light bearer
[2:11:41] [Music]
[2:11:42] so that you can get in the most negative
[2:11:45] situation where the whole powwow is
[2:11:47] negative and you just flip the switch
[2:11:50] and you just start shining a light that
[2:11:53] makes a difference
[2:11:56] it's the only key
[2:11:59] it's the only key if you think you may
[2:12:01] have a negativity bias here's the steps
[2:12:04] you have to recognize that it's there
[2:12:06] and you have to shift
[2:12:08] to a moment of gratitude
[2:12:10] you just start saying lord i'm going to
[2:12:12] give you thanks i'm going to give you
[2:12:13] things if you don't and here's the point
[2:12:16] if you don't
[2:12:17] everything you hear is going to
[2:12:19] reinforce the problem
[2:12:24] it will never do anything to change the
[2:12:28] situation
[2:12:29] that's why so many of us keep going back
[2:12:31] to our childhood
[2:12:34] we keep going back to what we've already
[2:12:36] stepped out of
[2:12:37] because we know how negative that might
[2:12:39] or might not have been
[2:12:41] i hear people all the time
[2:12:45] they're going back to things that
[2:12:46] mothers said thanks to fathers that
[2:12:48] listen folks
[2:12:51] if i lived my life that way
[2:12:55] i haven't forgotten the things my mother
[2:12:57] said to me
[2:12:58] when she was drunk
[2:13:01] i haven't forgot the things my father
[2:13:03] said to me when he was walking out the
[2:13:05] door
[2:13:07] if i choose to live in those things
[2:13:09] guess what
[2:13:11] it'll give me something to lean on the
[2:13:13] rest of my life to excuse all the things
[2:13:16] that i cannot change
[2:13:19] but if i say wait a minute
[2:13:21] it's true
[2:13:23] it's true it's horrible it's awful
[2:13:26] it breaks my heart for you when i hear
[2:13:29] some of the things that were said to you
[2:13:32] it reminds me it takes you back but
[2:13:35] you've got to be in a position in this
[2:13:37] hour where you can walk back through
[2:13:39] your life without letting it affect your
[2:13:43] present
[2:13:45] god does not always remove every memory
[2:13:48] of the past because he doesn't want you
[2:13:51] to forget how far you have come with him
[2:13:54] he wants you to see who you are today
[2:13:58] and how grace grace amazing grace has
[2:14:03] brought you this far
[2:14:05] [Music]
[2:14:07] we begin to use this i've seen even in
[2:14:10] the in the pentecostal and charismatic
[2:14:12] world they start using deliverance
[2:14:16] the whole ministry of deliverance as an
[2:14:18] excuse
[2:14:20] to live in the past
[2:14:23] there's not a person in this room that
[2:14:25] hasn't been wounded by words
[2:14:27] there's not a person in this room that
[2:14:29] hasn't been broken in church
[2:14:31] there's not a person in this room that
[2:14:33] hasn't been disappointed by other
[2:14:35] believers
[2:14:36] but we have to make a decision if we
[2:14:40] don't we'll stay in a lousy mood all the
[2:14:43] time because our thoughts will be lousy
[2:14:46] all the time because we'll be blaming
[2:14:49] and let me tell you something it's a
[2:14:51] defense mechanism of the brain
[2:14:53] because if mama's gone and daddy's gone
[2:14:56] you can't do anything
[2:14:58] about what you're carrying
[2:15:01] they're gone
[2:15:03] can't go to them
[2:15:04] can't talk it out
[2:15:06] can't tell them what you'd really like
[2:15:07] for them to know
[2:15:11] in some ways that's a good thing
[2:15:14] because there's questions that you'd
[2:15:16] like answers
[2:15:17] i've met people who found out later in
[2:15:20] life that they were adopted and they
[2:15:21] just wanted to i just want to know why i
[2:15:23] just want to know why i just want to
[2:15:25] know why i just want to know why i
[2:15:27] understand the need to know why but if
[2:15:29] they're gone
[2:15:31] you may not get the answers that you're
[2:15:33] looking for you may never have
[2:15:36] the answers
[2:15:38] that you are looking for if you live in
[2:15:40] the past
[2:15:43] why are you even mentioning these things
[2:15:45] because these things hinder our
[2:15:48] communications with god
[2:15:52] it causes everything we hear to be
[2:15:55] filtered through our own experience
[2:15:58] through our own pain
[2:16:00] through our own bias
[2:16:02] and therefore there are certain people
[2:16:04] in your life that can never do better
[2:16:06] because you won't let them do any better
[2:16:09] it doesn't matter what they do different
[2:16:10] you'll never let them be any different
[2:16:12] than they are because you have a bias
[2:16:16] that needs to be dealt with
[2:16:19] by the spirit of god and he wants to
[2:16:22] in fact that's why he operates in us as
[2:16:24] a spirit of supplication because he
[2:16:26] wants to cry out in prayer through us in
[2:16:29] our lives to push those dead cats off
[2:16:32] the line
[2:16:34] he wants to give you romans 8 1. listen
[2:16:36] romans 8 1 is your verse you ought to
[2:16:39] hold on to this
[2:16:41] there is therefore now
[2:16:51] god doesn't give you condemnation
[2:16:54] he will give you conviction
[2:16:57] conviction will cause you to reach up to
[2:16:59] him and be better
[2:17:01] condemnation will reinforce your
[2:17:03] negativity bias
[2:17:06] and it only makes us more religious
[2:17:11] condemnation will never make you more
[2:17:13] spiritual
[2:17:15] it will only make us more religious
[2:17:18] and the enemy knows that
[2:17:20] if the enemy can mess up our
[2:17:22] communication
[2:17:24] he can stop the relationship
[2:17:27] and if he stops the relationship
[2:17:29] particularly with god
[2:17:31] then our level of revelation becomes
[2:17:34] paralyzed
[2:17:36] we don't grow in the spirit
[2:17:38] the spirit of truth cannot reveal more
[2:17:41] of god to us
[2:17:43] the spirit of adoption cannot pull us
[2:17:45] closer to god the spirit of grace cannot
[2:17:48] minister the strength of the lord to us
[2:17:51] in situations that are painful or
[2:17:53] harmful or helpful and so we get in a
[2:17:56] lot of trouble
[2:17:59] there's a lot of offense
[2:18:01] that people carry in this hour
[2:18:05] is anybody still with me
[2:18:07] good i'm not quite ready to go
[2:18:09] matthew chapter 13
[2:18:12] verse 18 through 23.
[2:18:15] this is a parable
[2:18:17] this is
[2:18:19] getting a lot closer to where i wanted
[2:18:20] to be this morning it just took me a
[2:18:22] long time to get here
[2:18:26] verse 18
[2:18:28] hear ye therefore the parable
[2:18:31] of the sower
[2:18:35] when anyone heareth the word of the
[2:18:37] kingdom
[2:18:39] and understandeth it not
[2:18:45] this is
[2:18:47] not the parable of the sower
[2:18:50] this is the interpretation
[2:18:52] of the parable of the sower
[2:18:55] when anyone heareth the word of the
[2:18:56] kingdom and understand if it not then
[2:18:59] cometh the wicked one
[2:19:01] let's stop right there do you get that
[2:19:04] you get that
[2:19:06] if you understand the gospel of the
[2:19:08] kingdom if you understand the preaching
[2:19:11] of god's kingdom and that's everything
[2:19:13] in the book
[2:19:14] it's all about his kingdom his dominion
[2:19:17] his authority his power his love his
[2:19:19] grace his mercy the whole revelation of
[2:19:21] jesus christ is the message of the
[2:19:23] kingdom
[2:19:24] you can't have the kingdom without the
[2:19:26] king you can't have the king until you
[2:19:28] know who he is it took this message to
[2:19:31] reveal the king to us
[2:19:33] so we become citizens of the kingdom in
[2:19:35] our understanding
[2:19:37] if we hear the word of the kingdom and
[2:19:40] we don't understand it
[2:19:43] it affects us
[2:19:46] and it affects us in such a way it opens
[2:19:49] the door
[2:19:50] for the enemy to come in
[2:19:53] then cometh the wicked one
[2:19:57] you need to try to understand what you
[2:20:00] hear
[2:20:02] you need to be careful not to assume
[2:20:04] motives
[2:20:07] in what you hear
[2:20:10] like i mentioned earlier in this service
[2:20:12] someone assumed a motive
[2:20:15] i could tell by the physical reaction i
[2:20:18] thought i had a break of that for this
[2:20:20] week
[2:20:21] but i could tell by their physical
[2:20:23] reaction that they received what i just
[2:20:25] said in a way that it was not intended
[2:20:29] the problem with allowing that to happen
[2:20:32] is you open the door
[2:20:35] when you hear the word of the kingdom
[2:20:36] and what i was saying was the word of
[2:20:38] the kingdom
[2:20:39] oh yes
[2:20:41] because giving god everything we have
[2:20:43] when we come into his house that's the
[2:20:45] bible
[2:20:47] god deserves our undivided attention the
[2:20:50] word must have preeminence among us we
[2:20:52] have to sometimes look over the
[2:20:54] feebleness of the one who delivers the
[2:20:56] word but we've got to stay connected to
[2:20:59] the word of god that's why we're here we
[2:21:01] didn't come to have a good feeling we
[2:21:03] came to receive something that will
[2:21:05] strengthen us this week when the enemy
[2:21:07] tries to pull us back into negativity by
[2:21:10] us
[2:21:11] come on
[2:21:12] and so that reaction that people have
[2:21:14] that that
[2:21:17] sometimes in this church it means
[2:21:19] someone will will roll their eyes
[2:21:23] i'm just being honest i want you to hear
[2:21:25] this because i i have this opportunity
[2:21:27] now i'm taking it
[2:21:32] those are the kind of reactions that you
[2:21:34] have in conversation
[2:21:37] that is not a proper
[2:21:39] reaction to have
[2:21:41] when you are sitting in this house
[2:21:45] because you didn't get it
[2:21:47] or you didn't like it
[2:21:51] you were out of order
[2:21:55] you take sides with that you are out of
[2:21:58] order
[2:22:01] your reaction will not always be running
[2:22:04] the aisles amen i know that's the truth
[2:22:09] but if you are sure that you have dealt
[2:22:12] with that negativity bias
[2:22:15] then you will at least give the preacher
[2:22:18] the benefit of the doubt
[2:22:21] he's not out to harm me with the word
[2:22:24] he didn't come here today to try to
[2:22:26] me or break my leg
[2:22:29] or punish me
[2:22:31] he came here to try to help me
[2:22:34] we should ask ourselves am i having this
[2:22:36] reaction because i'm guilty
[2:22:40] do i want everybody in the building to
[2:22:41] know i don't like what's being said
[2:22:44] because i'm guilty
[2:22:46] or because i'm trying to build a fan
[2:22:48] club
[2:22:49] ask yourself that question
[2:22:51] because when we when we out in the open
[2:22:54] when we make it so
[2:22:57] public
[2:22:58] that we're opposing what's being said
[2:23:01] you are so affecting the atmosphere
[2:23:07] and if you can't receive
[2:23:10] because of your negativity bias what
[2:23:12] about the person next to you
[2:23:15] what about the one behind you
[2:23:17] what about the one in front of you
[2:23:20] here's what the word says when anyone
[2:23:22] heareth the word of the kingdom and
[2:23:24] understandeth it not then cometh the
[2:23:27] wicked one and catcheth the way that
[2:23:30] which was sown in his heart this is he
[2:23:34] which received seed by the wayside
[2:23:38] it's so snatched
[2:23:41] from you
[2:23:42] you you say all the preaching i've ever
[2:23:45] heard in my life shouldn't i be further
[2:23:47] along shouldn't i be closer to god every
[2:23:49] one of us should be closer to god by
[2:23:50] that absolutely we should but do you
[2:23:52] know why we're not because we didn't
[2:23:54] understand it all it's not a requirement
[2:23:57] to understand it all but if we don't
[2:23:59] understand it we've got to make sure
[2:24:01] that we don't give entrance for the
[2:24:03] enemy to come in and steal it
[2:24:06] we hold on to it and say lord when i'm
[2:24:10] ready to receive it when i'm ready to
[2:24:12] understand it let the holy ghost make it
[2:24:16] real to me
[2:24:17] don't let me reject it because i've got
[2:24:20] a problem with the messenger don't let
[2:24:22] me reject it because i've got a problem
[2:24:24] in my life that he doesn't seem to
[2:24:26] understand don't let me reject it
[2:24:29] because i don't like the fact that
[2:24:31] someone is looking at me or they are not
[2:24:34] looking at me
[2:24:41] because if i do that then the enemy
[2:24:43] comes in and steals that word and unless
[2:24:45] i go back and revisit it
[2:24:48] i've lost
[2:24:50] i've lost
[2:24:51] god help us we don't want to lose
[2:24:54] he goes on to say
[2:24:56] ah
[2:24:58] this is he which received seed by the
[2:25:00] wayside but he that received the seed
[2:25:03] into stony places
[2:25:05] the same is he that heareth the word and
[2:25:08] anon with joy receiveth it
[2:25:13] that word is an unusual word
[2:25:15] it's not a mistype
[2:25:17] it means suddenly
[2:25:20] but he that receive or immediately
[2:25:23] but he that received the word into stony
[2:25:25] places the same is he that heareth the
[2:25:28] word
[2:25:31] and immediately with joy receiveth it
[2:25:35] he said amen he took it applied it to
[2:25:38] himself let's go on
[2:25:40] ye ha
[2:25:41] yet he hath not root in himself
[2:25:46] had nothing to do with the seed had
[2:25:48] nothing to do with the sower had nothing
[2:25:50] to do with his initial reaction
[2:25:55] but because in himself
[2:25:58] there's no root there's no depth
[2:26:01] but dureth for a while for when
[2:26:03] tribulation or persecution arises
[2:26:06] because of the word by and by
[2:26:11] he's offended not the first time
[2:26:14] but by and by
[2:26:16] he's offended
[2:26:18] he wasn't offended immediately he
[2:26:20] received it gladly he nodded he smiled
[2:26:23] but after a while because he has no root
[2:26:26] and here's why he has no root he doesn't
[2:26:28] read the word of god
[2:26:30] he doesn't hear the message of the hour
[2:26:32] he just comes to church
[2:26:34] so he hears it in church nowhere else
[2:26:38] there's no root in him it can't go deep
[2:26:40] down in our inner being because it's
[2:26:42] only visited when we're in the presence
[2:26:43] of other folks in church
[2:26:45] come on
[2:26:46] we're too busy with all the other things
[2:26:48] in our life we don't take time for god's
[2:26:50] word if you're under the impression that
[2:26:52] only preachers should read the word
[2:26:53] every day i'm telling you you're going
[2:26:55] to be sadly sadly short
[2:26:58] you're going to come up sadly sadly
[2:27:00] short when we're trying to win this mind
[2:27:01] battle you cannot win the mind battle
[2:27:04] when you entertain more negative
[2:27:06] thoughts than you do with positive truth
[2:27:09] so you got to throw that out of balance
[2:27:13] the only way to throw it out of balance
[2:27:15] is flood your life with god's truth
[2:27:19] so that you don't allow your offense
[2:27:23] to steal your seed
[2:27:25] is that good it is good
[2:27:28] next verse
[2:27:29] he also that received seed among the
[2:27:31] thorns
[2:27:32] is he that heareth the word
[2:27:35] and the care of this world he didn't
[2:27:37] reject it he heard it
[2:27:39] but the care of this world and the
[2:27:42] deceitfulness of riches choke the word
[2:27:46] and he becometh unfruitful
[2:27:50] but he that receiveth seed into the good
[2:27:53] ground
[2:27:54] is he that heareth the word and
[2:27:59] understand if it which also beareth
[2:28:03] fruit and bringeth forth some a
[2:28:05] hundredfold some sixtyfold some
[2:28:08] thirtyfold now
[2:28:10] jesus said the seed was the word
[2:28:13] the sower was the enemy
[2:28:16] i want you to tell me what makes the
[2:28:18] difference
[2:28:20] what makes the difference
[2:28:22] in all of these different categories
[2:28:25] it's soil
[2:28:29] it's soil and soil is the mind
[2:28:34] in every one of these situations what
[2:28:37] made the difference
[2:28:42] the mind
[2:28:44] the mindset
[2:28:45] how it was received
[2:28:47] how do we change
[2:28:49] the effectiveness of god's word in our
[2:28:51] heart in our mind in our life
[2:28:53] we change our thoughts
[2:28:57] it's our attitude
[2:29:00] that determines our atmosphere
[2:29:03] and our atmosphere determines the
[2:29:06] effectiveness
[2:29:08] of god's seed
[2:29:09] in our lives
[2:29:11] i don't know if you're still with me or
[2:29:12] not
[2:29:14] satan comes immediately to snatch away
[2:29:16] the word for those who do not understand
[2:29:21] but in each of those situations
[2:29:24] it's how you receive it's what your
[2:29:26] mindset is it's what's going on in your
[2:29:29] soil
[2:29:30] that determines whether that word
[2:29:32] changes you or not
[2:29:34] did you know that makes your thought
[2:29:36] process even more powerful
[2:29:40] than the message you hear
[2:29:45] not for me
[2:29:49] yes
[2:29:51] for all of us
[2:29:53] now what you can say is
[2:29:58] it's not affecting
[2:30:00] us all the same
[2:30:02] because we're not all the same ground
[2:30:05] it's almost thorny ground some some was
[2:30:07] good ground some was
[2:30:09] some was shallow ground
[2:30:11] rocky ground
[2:30:12] the sun the elements of the world
[2:30:15] the word was the same the word was the
[2:30:17] same the seed was the same the sower was
[2:30:20] the same
[2:30:21] the word was the same the difference was
[2:30:23] the soil
[2:30:25] and so if you're if you're saying to me
[2:30:27] that for me
[2:30:30] my soil is more important more powerful
[2:30:34] than the message i hear i'm saying yes
[2:30:38] because my soil determines how effective
[2:30:42] that word can be
[2:30:45] in me
[2:30:46] did anybody understand that
[2:30:49] so this is not some false doctrine i'm
[2:30:51] trying to preach here
[2:30:53] it's exactly what mark 4 24 said
[2:30:56] take heed what you hear
[2:30:59] with what measure you meet it shall be
[2:31:00] measured to you and unto you that here
[2:31:02] shall more be given
[2:31:04] be amplified be careful what you're
[2:31:05] hearing the measure of thought and study
[2:31:07] you give to the truth you hear will be
[2:31:09] the measure of virtue and knowledge that
[2:31:11] comes back to you and more besides
[2:31:14] will be given to you
[2:31:16] who what
[2:31:18] who here
[2:31:24] just trying to decide if i
[2:31:27] how far i want to go
[2:31:29] it was oddly enough i haven't gotten to
[2:31:31] where i needed to go but
[2:31:32] i should have by now it's on me
[2:31:35] so uh psalms 119 let's get skip here
[2:31:41] psalm 119 and verse 165 great peace
[2:31:46] great peace
[2:31:48] great shalom
[2:31:51] have they which love thy law
[2:31:54] and
[2:32:01] we're not all living that out
[2:32:04] but we all know that's who we want to be
[2:32:07] we want to be that
[2:32:09] how many of it like to be unoffendable
[2:32:12] i mean really just let it roll off
[2:32:16] i i believe as believers it's possible
[2:32:21] the problem with holding on to offense
[2:32:24] is it clouds everything we hear
[2:32:27] we hear everything with our offense and
[2:32:30] so we just keep getting offended that's
[2:32:31] why people can't forgive and forget and
[2:32:33] get over it because they keep getting
[2:32:35] offended
[2:32:36] about the same thing because they never
[2:32:38] forgave in the first place
[2:32:42] they're people in life who never see
[2:32:45] their part
[2:32:47] in the play
[2:32:49] they only see you not doing your part
[2:32:54] they can never see their own failure
[2:32:57] to play fair
[2:32:59] but they recognize yours why because
[2:33:01] they have a negativity bias
[2:33:09] the beginning of
[2:33:11] this year
[2:33:12] i asked the lord
[2:33:14] to talk to me about the predominant
[2:33:17] spirits
[2:33:19] that affected excuse me i have to take
[2:33:21] that back it was not the beginning of
[2:33:23] 2021 it was the beginning of the hebrew
[2:33:26] year
[2:33:27] it was probably the end of august
[2:33:30] and i asked the lord to show me
[2:33:33] what because i wanted to attack them in
[2:33:35] prayer
[2:33:37] what were the two biggest spirits that
[2:33:40] operated among us as the family of god
[2:33:42] in this house and the two spirits that i
[2:33:44] was shown was the spirit of jealousy and
[2:33:47] the spirit of offense
[2:33:50] the problem with jealousy is jealous
[2:33:54] people never see
[2:33:59] that they're jealous
[2:34:01] i know one exception
[2:34:03] i know one sister who has come to me
[2:34:06] more than one time through the years
[2:34:08] to say to me
[2:34:10] i i i battle jealousy
[2:34:14] and boy i admire that i mean i admire
[2:34:17] that
[2:34:19] that makes you want to really pray for
[2:34:21] somebody
[2:34:22] and it wasn't husband wife that's easy
[2:34:26] there's a lot of that that goes on
[2:34:28] wasn't husband and wife it was just the
[2:34:31] enemy
[2:34:32] trying to make this person feel less
[2:34:34] than
[2:34:35] and let me tell you this you'll never
[2:34:37] feel less than
[2:34:39] by looking at god's word
[2:34:42] not once you become a holy ghost-filled
[2:34:43] believer and romans 8 1 is your is your
[2:34:46] message once you understand there's
[2:34:48] therefore now no condemnation you will
[2:34:50] no longer allow god's word to condemn
[2:34:52] you
[2:34:53] it will correct you it will convict you
[2:34:55] it will help you but it will not condemn
[2:34:57] you you you will not allow the word to
[2:34:59] condemn you because if you do you'll
[2:35:01] receive it in the wrong spirit it'll
[2:35:03] never be able to help you
[2:35:05] okay
[2:35:06] that thing of jealousy will get in our
[2:35:08] life and we will be jealous and and you
[2:35:10] it can be pointed out
[2:35:14] and it's almost impossible to see it
[2:35:18] how does it get on us how does it even
[2:35:21] start when we spend more time looking at
[2:35:23] other people
[2:35:25] than looking at him
[2:35:27] otherwise there's nothing to be jealous
[2:35:28] about
[2:35:31] now you say i just don't believe i just
[2:35:33] don't believe i've got any jealousy in
[2:35:35] me whatsoever well then you're you're
[2:35:37] you're the minority
[2:35:40] because the lord said the spirit of
[2:35:41] jealousy and the spirit of offense he
[2:35:44] also dealt with my heart that it was
[2:35:45] affecting people's prayer lives
[2:35:50] because of that feeling you don't really
[2:35:52] want to feel that way
[2:35:55] or perhaps you have not yet seen
[2:35:58] that you've got that operating in your
[2:36:00] life and so it just hangs over you like
[2:36:03] a dark cloud
[2:36:06] there's really no reason for us to be
[2:36:08] jealous of believers
[2:36:16] but they get to go on a trip well they
[2:36:19] get to do this and they get to do that
[2:36:21] and they get to experience this and they
[2:36:23] get to have their grandchildren and they
[2:36:25] get to do the other and they
[2:36:32] the enemy likes to work that way because
[2:36:36] it affects us it causes us to be
[2:36:39] offended at one another and more
[2:36:41] importantly than that a person that is
[2:36:44] chronically jealous really is offended
[2:36:48] with god
[2:36:53] you allow them to have blah blah blah
[2:36:55] and go blah blah blah bill blah blah
[2:36:57] blah and pay blah blah
[2:37:00] it's not that person
[2:37:02] you don't understand why god would allow
[2:37:04] it to be that way somebody said i never
[2:37:06] thought of it that way you should
[2:37:08] because great peace
[2:37:12] have they which loved by law
[2:37:16] and nothing
[2:37:20] shall offend them
[2:37:22] that word offend means to put a snare or
[2:37:24] a stumbling block in their way
[2:37:26] [Music]
[2:37:27] it's referred to a bait stick of a trap
[2:37:31] used to metaphorically imply that which
[2:37:33] hinders right conduct or thought that
[2:37:36] which causes them to stumble into a trap
[2:37:39] it's a stick of bait
[2:37:41] it's something that pulls them in
[2:37:44] isaiah 26 3 is the answer thou will keep
[2:37:48] him in
[2:37:51] perfect peace whose
[2:37:54] mind
[2:38:00] it's not an automatic setting
[2:38:03] you have to keep tuning back in
[2:38:06] because the enemy comes to disturb our
[2:38:08] peace
[2:38:09] are you with me
[2:38:10] good i'm nearly done i gotta hurry
[2:38:12] really gotta hurry
[2:38:14] i'm not gonna drag this to tuesday night
[2:38:17] hebrews 12 15.
[2:38:20] this is what i want you to hear
[2:38:22] looking diligently lest any man fail
[2:38:26] of the grace of god
[2:38:28] lest any root of bitterness
[2:38:32] springing up
[2:38:34] trouble you
[2:38:35] and thereby
[2:38:37] many be
[2:38:38] defiled
[2:38:40] i said lord i don't have to have an
[2:38:42] answer to what is the source of jealousy
[2:38:44] i know how jealousy operates
[2:38:47] would you please help me to understand
[2:38:50] how
[2:38:51] someone can be chronically held in a
[2:38:55] spirit of offense
[2:38:58] and the lord spoke to my heart and said
[2:39:00] the root of the spirit of offense is the
[2:39:03] root of bitterness
[2:39:06] if an individual will allow me to deal
[2:39:08] with the root of bitterness in their
[2:39:10] life and by that root of bitterness they
[2:39:13] filter everything they see
[2:39:17] bitter
[2:39:20] i always thought that offense
[2:39:22] leads to bitterness
[2:39:24] and it probably does
[2:39:26] but the spirit of offense
[2:39:29] to deal with the spirit of offense the
[2:39:32] lord said to me the root of that is the
[2:39:34] root of bitterness if we if that person
[2:39:38] if if all peoples
[2:39:40] can deal with the root of bitterness it
[2:39:42] breaks the authority of the spirit of
[2:39:44] offense in their life
[2:39:47] i want to be free from that
[2:39:49] a couple years ago at a prayer meeting
[2:39:51] three four years ago and five years ago
[2:39:53] now i taught one morning on the spirit
[2:39:56] of bitterness
[2:39:58] because god was trying to rescue someone
[2:40:02] in that prayer meeting that day
[2:40:04] from the spirit of bitterness
[2:40:07] and god brought a lesson you can have
[2:40:10] the notes
[2:40:11] because we gave them out in the prayer
[2:40:13] meeting many of you could have been in
[2:40:15] those meetings and chill many of you
[2:40:17] chose not to i understand many of you
[2:40:19] are working some of you could have been
[2:40:21] and you chose not to and you really
[2:40:23] missed something
[2:40:24] because there were some things that god
[2:40:26] brought out to us and among us in some
[2:40:28] of those meetings that really helped set
[2:40:31] an atmosphere when we got to the house
[2:40:33] of god
[2:40:35] hebrews 12 15 looking diligently lest
[2:40:38] any man fail of the grace of god lest
[2:40:40] any root of bitterness springing up
[2:40:42] trouble you and thereby many be defiled
[2:40:47] bitterness is that word bitterness
[2:40:49] that's used there is a resentful spirit
[2:40:53] have you ever recognized that someone
[2:40:55] resented you
[2:40:57] yeah
[2:40:58] and you don't understand what you've
[2:41:00] done or what you keep doing
[2:41:02] that causes them to be resent resenting
[2:41:05] you
[2:41:06] if you have resentment in your heart
[2:41:08] towards somebody it causes you to behave
[2:41:10] in a resentful manner
[2:41:13] and if you're carrying the spirit of
[2:41:15] events you begin to think that that
[2:41:18] vengeance
[2:41:21] getting them back is the way to break
[2:41:22] the thing that's holding them
[2:41:25] you better leave god's work to god
[2:41:27] come on help me now
[2:41:29] you're not the venging angel
[2:41:33] you better let god deal with his
[2:41:34] children you get in the middle let me
[2:41:36] tell you something if god is trying to
[2:41:39] listen carefully now
[2:41:41] if god is trying to deal with something
[2:41:43] from this pulpit
[2:41:45] and you get between this pulpit and the
[2:41:47] person that god is trying to deal with
[2:41:50] you are in danger
[2:41:54] you are in danger
[2:41:56] we better let god do god's business
[2:41:59] let him execute vengeance when it's
[2:42:01] needed and you do what the bible tells
[2:42:03] us to do pray he
[2:42:06] one
[2:42:07] for
[2:42:08] another
[2:42:10] in the message 1957 brother branham said
[2:42:12] may every root of bitterness be grubbed
[2:42:17] out
[2:42:19] by god's sharp
[2:42:21] grubbing hole
[2:42:23] how many of you are ready for the
[2:42:24] grubbing hole
[2:42:26] you're still here
[2:42:28] revelation chapter four
[2:42:30] number three is the sermon
[2:42:33] paragraph nine
[2:42:35] and the little church
[2:42:37] i admonish you
[2:42:39] in the name of the lord jesus to grow in
[2:42:42] the grace of god
[2:42:44] hold yourself steady
[2:42:47] and look towards calvary
[2:42:49] all the time
[2:42:51] taking all the roots of bitterness out
[2:42:55] of your heart and soul that god might
[2:42:59] use you
[2:43:01] at
[2:43:03] any
[2:43:04] time
[2:43:07] remember just a few weeks ago when we
[2:43:09] talked about the the huge percentage of
[2:43:12] illness
[2:43:15] that comes from thought life
[2:43:21] it's not just arthritis
[2:43:24] there are so
[2:43:25] many physical maladies physical ailments
[2:43:29] physical symptoms
[2:43:32] that are directly related to how we
[2:43:34] process
[2:43:36] life
[2:43:37] which is our thought life
[2:43:41] and to change our thought life can
[2:43:44] change our attitude it can change our
[2:43:46] mood and it can change even the cells of
[2:43:49] our body
[2:43:51] i'm done nearly
[2:43:53] did you know that a lot of us hold the
[2:43:56] power of healing
[2:43:57] in our own life
[2:43:59] god's given it to us did you know the
[2:44:01] body heals itself
[2:44:03] physician
[2:44:05] heal thyself
[2:44:07] the body has the ability god-given
[2:44:11] created ability to deal with a lot of
[2:44:13] the things that we deal with
[2:44:15] and by correcting our thoughts by taking
[2:44:18] god's grubbing hoe
[2:44:21] and allowing him to find any root of
[2:44:23] bitterness
[2:44:25] any resentment any jealousy that we have
[2:44:28] not yet been delivered from letting god
[2:44:30] deal with that can help us so
[2:44:34] tremendously
[2:44:36] [Music]
[2:44:37] i'm lost some of you
[2:44:43] god may use you at any time if you ever
[2:44:45] feel to do something or a revelation or
[2:44:47] something comes to you strangely
[2:44:49] something warningly or something be
[2:44:51] careful
[2:44:53] satan is as sly and slick as he can be
[2:44:57] see put it with the word of god
[2:45:05] and what
[2:45:07] what else does it say
[2:45:10] put it with the word of god and consult
[2:45:12] your pastor
[2:45:18] this quote does actually say that
[2:45:26] is there nothing past that god might use
[2:45:28] you at any time
[2:45:31] if you ever feel to do something there
[2:45:33] it is
[2:45:34] if you ever feel to do i saw how quick
[2:45:36] you all said no
[2:45:40] about consulting your pastor thank you
[2:45:42] thank you thank you that'll give me more
[2:45:44] time
[2:45:45] if you ever feel to do something or a
[2:45:47] revelation or something comes to you
[2:45:48] strangely something warningly or
[2:45:50] something be careful satan is as sly and
[2:45:52] sleek as he can be see put it with the
[2:45:54] word of god and consult your pastor see
[2:45:59] you you'd have to at least say hello to
[2:46:01] me to be able to consult me about what's
[2:46:02] going on in your life
[2:46:08] in the smyrna smyrnian church age
[2:46:11] paragraph 53 the only thing that matter
[2:46:14] the only thing the matter gets all these
[2:46:16] little differences away from you little
[2:46:18] isms and little funny feelings around
[2:46:20] you for brethren and things like that
[2:46:22] shake it away
[2:46:25] don't let no root of bitterness ever get
[2:46:28] into your soul that's mind will and
[2:46:30] emotions
[2:46:32] if you do
[2:46:34] it'll what
[2:46:36] canker you right keep love
[2:46:38] i don't care how much people hate you
[2:46:47] keep moving
[2:46:49] you love them anyhow
[2:46:52] brother perry green used to say you are
[2:46:55] not responsible to make people love you
[2:46:59] but you are responsible to love them
[2:47:04] come on now that doesn't mean compromise
[2:47:07] with their sin
[2:47:09] it means let them know when you're ready
[2:47:11] to turn
[2:47:13] get your life straightened out get back
[2:47:15] to where you need to be with god i'm
[2:47:17] here i am here i am never ever ever
[2:47:20] going to leave you
[2:47:22] but we can't walk together until we're
[2:47:24] agreed
[2:47:26] that's what the scripture said but i'm
[2:47:28] there i will be there i will call if you
[2:47:31] need me you call on me
[2:47:33] let me tell you something i've been
[2:47:34] pretty pretty upset with folks at times
[2:47:38] and oddly enough a need would come up in
[2:47:40] their life i want you to know if you're
[2:47:42] if you're trying your best to walk in
[2:47:44] love toward people you'll forget that so
[2:47:46] quick it may come back to you later
[2:47:50] but when somebody's got a need
[2:47:53] that thing strikes you all you care
[2:47:54] about is helping that need to be met
[2:47:57] amen you may have to go back and deal
[2:47:59] with your own emotions later but a real
[2:48:01] child of god would never say not them
[2:48:05] i'm not going to help them
[2:48:07] i'm not going to do anything for them
[2:48:08] keep love i don't care how much people
[2:48:11] hate you you love them anyhow if you
[2:48:13] can't do that
[2:48:14] you ain't sealed
[2:48:17] you've got a loose place yet
[2:48:20] so come on on back and get that sealed
[2:48:22] upright good with the blood of christ
[2:48:24] it'll cleanse you from all roots of
[2:48:25] bitterness
[2:48:26] hallelujah
[2:48:29] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[2:48:30] the musicians are coming
[2:48:35] if paragraph 86 if the brother you think
[2:48:38] he's a little wrong
[2:48:40] or the sister say lord don't let me
[2:48:44] never have that root of bitterness
[2:48:47] spring up
[2:48:49] cause it'll affect him
[2:48:52] and it'll take the christ
[2:48:55] right out of my
[2:48:58] life
[2:49:00] that poison
[2:49:02] acids of malice
[2:49:05] and jealousy
[2:49:06] and hatred that will just take the holy
[2:49:10] spirit right away from you
[2:49:12] [Music]
[2:49:13] it will run him from the tabernacle here
[2:49:18] it'll kill the spirit of god
[2:49:21] drive it away from here hurt your pastor
[2:49:25] it'll do everything see
[2:49:28] don't
[2:49:29] you
[2:49:30] do
[2:49:31] that
[2:49:32] you just wax that much closer together
[2:49:36] draw up take the buckle
[2:49:38] as the brother testified a minister here
[2:49:41] the other night about having a buckle
[2:49:44] seeing it in a vision
[2:49:45] just that buckles on
[2:49:48] the whole
[2:49:50] armor
[2:49:52] of god just pull their own
[2:49:55] tighten up
[2:49:56] move right up close to one another love
[2:49:59] one another anyhow talk nice about one
[2:50:02] another say nice things about one
[2:50:05] another and then
[2:50:07] god
[2:50:12] god
[2:50:13] will bless you do you know who that
[2:50:14] brother was
[2:50:17] that was brother cleveland
[2:50:20] brother cleveland is the man who
[2:50:22] testified in the tabernacle
[2:50:25] about the belt buckle
[2:50:28] when the picture the supernatural
[2:50:30] picture was taken i took that
[2:50:32] supernatural picture in tucson
[2:50:37] and
[2:50:38] so many things were going on about that
[2:50:40] photograph
[2:50:42] and each person would see it and they
[2:50:44] would see something different
[2:50:48] one person said i see a belt buckle
[2:50:52] and i call brother cleveland
[2:50:55] from tucson
[2:50:57] and i told him i've got another picture
[2:50:58] of that belt buckle you were talking
[2:51:00] about that night in the tabernacle
[2:51:02] because in that
[2:51:05] service where the pillar of fire came
[2:51:07] down brother brandon was preaching and
[2:51:09] the lilies grew how many of you know
[2:51:11] pictures i'm talking about there's a
[2:51:13] series of pictures and as the pillar of
[2:51:16] fire came down
[2:51:17] the perspective of the lilies that were
[2:51:20] sitting there on the front they got
[2:51:22] really really large but the position of
[2:51:24] the camera was not changing but the
[2:51:26] pillar of fire made a difference and in
[2:51:28] one of those pictures you can look and
[2:51:30] see the belt buckle and that was what
[2:51:32] brother what brother cleveland
[2:51:33] referenced in the tabernacle that night
[2:51:37] brother branham said to him
[2:51:40] i can show you that belt buckle
[2:51:44] and it represented the buckle of truth
[2:51:49] it represents what holds the armor on
[2:51:53] we're putting it on but we got to have
[2:51:55] something to hold it on
[2:51:57] and ultimately that is
[2:52:01] not a truth but
[2:52:03] the truth let's stand
[2:52:05] thank you for getting with me
[2:52:07] it was a long haul but we made it
[2:52:09] through
[2:52:13] i feel like the spirit of god is giving
[2:52:15] us
[2:52:17] another opportunity
[2:52:20] to change our lives
[2:52:22] by changing our thoughts
[2:52:25] we may not do it
[2:52:27] it may not be something we can do
[2:52:29] corporately it may be something we have
[2:52:30] to do as individuals
[2:52:32] and then we come together a bunch of
[2:52:34] changed people
[2:52:36] and guess what that does it changes the
[2:52:38] corporate atmosphere
[2:52:40] now don't you go out of here with a
[2:52:41] misunderstanding
[2:52:43] you ask the lord to speak to your heart
[2:52:45] and help you to understand where we are
[2:52:49] and what god wants to do in our life
[2:52:52] regardless of what you're facing you
[2:52:54] cannot afford to let bitterness keep a
[2:52:57] root
[2:52:58] you cannot afford to let jealousy sour
[2:53:01] your life
[2:53:03] you can't allow
[2:53:04] these negative biases negative bias
[2:53:08] you can't afford to allow that to cause
[2:53:10] you to see the glass always
[2:53:13] half empty
[2:53:15] and never see what god has done maybe it
[2:53:18] wasn't filled up to the top but how do
[2:53:20] you think it got filled at all
[2:53:23] the goodness of god the blessing of god
[2:53:25] the mercies of god the provision of god
[2:53:30] if you find yourself this week in a bias
[2:53:35] of negativity grab it
[2:53:39] take
[2:53:39] just a moment
[2:53:41] to be grateful
[2:53:43] lord it could be so much worse
[2:53:45] i want to thank you for how you've
[2:53:47] touched me i want to thank you for how
[2:53:48] you've helped me i want to thank you for
[2:53:50] how you've helped my family how you've
[2:53:53] moved on their behalf and just watch the
[2:53:55] rest of that it just starts
[2:53:57] it just dissipates
[2:54:00] eventually we fill up our hearts with
[2:54:02] the word of god and it transforms the
[2:54:05] way we think
[2:54:06] all together because we're rebuilding
[2:54:08] we're renewing renewing our mind we're
[2:54:11] rebuilding our mind we're taking the
[2:54:13] mind of christ we're receiving god's
[2:54:15] word and his word deals with everything
[2:54:19] that the enemy is trying to do
[2:54:22] don't ever stand between god and what
[2:54:24] he's trying to do
[2:54:26] if you can't be a part you stand back
[2:54:28] and pray
[2:54:30] but don't you ever get in god's way it's
[2:54:31] too late in the hour to be in god's way
[2:54:34] you want to let him do what he's about
[2:54:36] to do it's good
[2:54:38] may get ugly it may get dark it may get
[2:54:40] a little bit uh uncomfortable
[2:54:43] but oh what he can do
[2:54:46] when we trust him
[2:54:49] he can do so much
[2:54:50] let's worship before we go today we need
[2:54:53] healing we need strength we need courage
[2:54:56] we need understanding and every bit of
[2:54:58] that's found in the presence of the lord
[2:55:00] let's worship him i know it got late
[2:55:03] but let's worship him for just a moment
[2:55:05] or two see what he has

[3:03:18] the way it works i have to send it each
[3:03:20] one individually you put it in a
[3:03:22] software but i have to send it
[3:03:24] individually to you and so it takes a
[3:03:26] little while to to go in and make sure
[3:03:28] you get it and i appreciate all of you
[3:03:30] who have acknowledged getting it
[3:03:33] it makes me feel bad if i don't hear
[3:03:35] from folks for a long period of time
[3:03:37] i don't want to be that person that
[3:03:39] sends it when you don't want it but
[3:03:43] i had a strange uh night thursday night
[3:03:46] and
[3:03:47] we had come from a lovely evening at
[3:03:51] david and ashley's
[3:03:53] and
[3:03:54] i like to be invited to david and i
[3:03:57] enjoyed it so much i appreciated it so
[3:03:59] much
[3:04:01] it was one of those things where i kind
[3:04:02] of dread social events
[3:04:05] people say they don't believe it about
[3:04:07] me but if you know me you know it's true
[3:04:10] and i have to work myself up to get into
[3:04:13] big gatherings or once i get there i'm
[3:04:15] doing real good
[3:04:16] i love to talk so you can usually talk
[3:04:20] but
[3:04:20] i i can't say i was just really looking
[3:04:23] forward to it but i i really appreciated
[3:04:25] the invitation
[3:04:27] and we got there as a family and it was
[3:04:30] the most wonderful evening
[3:04:32] the home their little home they have
[3:04:34] fixed up i said you all have got to send
[3:04:37] sister west a picture she's got to see
[3:04:39] and they said we want to invite her to
[3:04:41] come and see it
[3:04:42] it was so comfortable
[3:04:45] you like to go somewhere where it just
[3:04:47] feels comfortable the atmosphere feels
[3:04:49] comfortable and it felt so comfortable
[3:04:52] and the food was so delicious i know
[3:04:54] you're standing up but
[3:04:56] i've been i've been sitting down today
[3:04:58] so i can go another hour
[3:05:01] uh
[3:05:02] the food was so delicious
[3:05:05] i thought about that food after i got so
[3:05:07] sick the next day i said i ought to have
[3:05:09] a lot of fun with david and
[3:05:11] tell him i was doing good till i ate
[3:05:12] your food
[3:05:14] i don't think i've ever had fried
[3:05:15] chicken like that it was unbelievable
[3:05:20] and then they played a game well i don't
[3:05:22] like games too much i
[3:05:25] you ever feel too old to play games
[3:05:28] well i felt that way 25 years ago
[3:05:32] but they they had a game and they didn't
[3:05:34] really ask i don't ever remember being
[3:05:36] asked if i wanted to play in fact i
[3:05:38] think somebody said that and i said no
[3:05:41] i'm not going to play
[3:05:43] but i just
[3:05:44] they played right where we were sitting
[3:05:47] so i just played i don't know why i did
[3:05:50] and i had so much fun fun
[3:05:52] whoa
[3:05:56] and i went home feeling so good and i
[3:05:58] just let them know how much i
[3:05:59] appreciated the invitation and what a
[3:06:02] warm evening we had and that night i
[3:06:03] went to sleep
[3:06:05] and slept good but i dreamed all night
[3:06:07] long i had i said at least a dozen
[3:06:10] dreams i think it'd probably be closer
[3:06:12] to 15 or 20 dreams
[3:06:14] and every one of them was dark
[3:06:18] desperate situations
[3:06:21] death was lingering around
[3:06:24] i
[3:06:25] dreamed about some of my own stuff
[3:06:28] and i dreamed about being with other
[3:06:30] people in their stuff
[3:06:33] and i if i told you some of it you just
[3:06:35] think i was loony
[3:06:38] it was so
[3:06:40] bad
[3:06:42] until i just found myself thinking there
[3:06:45] is no need
[3:06:47] to hope
[3:06:49] i know what's going to happen
[3:06:52] it was so obvious
[3:06:54] in every dream
[3:06:57] and when i dreamed the next one it was
[3:06:59] like i hadn't even had
[3:07:00] a good sign at the end of the first one
[3:07:02] it was like bat right back into that
[3:07:05] desperate i saw people in terrible
[3:07:07] condition physically spiritually
[3:07:10] mentally emotionally
[3:07:12] and i already knew in my mind the end
[3:07:15] so i braced myself each time
[3:07:17] for it to be worse
[3:07:19] and all of a sudden
[3:07:22] every time
[3:07:23] in different ways
[3:07:25] jesus walked in
[3:07:27] amen
[3:07:28] i only saw him in a few of the dreams
[3:07:30] but i knew he came in
[3:07:32] whether i saw him or not
[3:07:34] because it was like an entirely
[3:07:36] different end
[3:07:39] was laid out before me
[3:07:41] i said oh my what has changed what a
[3:07:45] shock
[3:07:47] look what god has done in the last
[3:07:51] seconds in one of them i looked at my
[3:07:53] watch and i said he only had three
[3:07:56] seconds
[3:07:57] left
[3:07:58] and it would have all been over but he
[3:08:01] came in
[3:08:03] right on time
[3:08:05] with only three seconds to work he
[3:08:07] didn't need anymore
[3:08:09] he didn't need any more than that
[3:08:12] and he so encouraged me and then i went
[3:08:14] right back into one of those dark
[3:08:16] situations again and i wish that in my
[3:08:18] mind i could have remembered
[3:08:21] what had just happened in the previous
[3:08:23] dream but i didn't i got plunged right
[3:08:26] back down into the desperation of of
[3:08:28] hopelessness and
[3:08:30] i saw this nation in a horrible mess
[3:08:34] it smelled like a cesspool
[3:08:38] and i thought i can't go on we'll never
[3:08:41] be able to make it like this we've seen
[3:08:43] the last of
[3:08:45] of any stirring
[3:08:47] because if we stir it all they'll come
[3:08:49] and shut us down
[3:08:51] and lock us up that was the dream that
[3:08:53] was that dream and i couldn't remember
[3:08:56] that god had just moved in the one
[3:08:58] before
[3:08:59] but in the last little bit oh
[3:09:02] god just came in and he came in i
[3:09:04] remember particularly in that one he
[3:09:06] came in in a way i never saw him coming
[3:09:08] never thought about him using that way
[3:09:11] never thought about him how he could
[3:09:12] change things so miraculously in a way
[3:09:15] i'd never anticipated and i was back up
[3:09:18] on the mountain
[3:09:20] and then i'd go right back into another
[3:09:22] one of those dreams
[3:09:24] it was only when i woke up the last time
[3:09:28] as someone pointed out
[3:09:30] the text was a little late getting
[3:09:33] getting to him on friday
[3:09:35] and that was not because i wasn't awake
[3:09:37] it was because i was trying to write it
[3:09:39] in such a way that it made sense
[3:09:42] when i woke up the last time
[3:09:44] i remembered
[3:09:48] that every dream had been dark
[3:09:51] and that god had come through in the
[3:09:52] last seconds of every dream i woke up
[3:09:55] many times went to the bathroom and did
[3:09:57] not remember
[3:09:59] the bright end
[3:10:01] but when i woke up from the last dream i
[3:10:03] lay there and i thought my my every time
[3:10:06] every time every time no matter how bad
[3:10:10] it looked you came
[3:10:13] and oh what a difference you made i'm
[3:10:15] telling you god didn't let that happen
[3:10:17] to me all night thursday night and then
[3:10:19] friday
[3:10:21] in the day
[3:10:22] friday morning and then by
[3:10:25] friday afternoon i could not walk
[3:10:28] and when i tell you i can't walk
[3:10:29] couldn't walk that's what i mean i could
[3:10:31] not walk i could not put my foot on the
[3:10:34] floor to walk it hurt too bad
[3:10:36] when i sat in the chair with it up in
[3:10:38] the air it hurt just as bad as if i was
[3:10:41] trying to put weight on it
[3:10:43] and you know what kept me getting
[3:10:44] through it
[3:10:46] i said
[3:10:47] well
[3:10:48] i didn't dream this
[3:10:50] but if god could do that in every one of
[3:10:52] those dreams
[3:10:54] he can come in hallelujah i feel good
[3:10:57] now
[3:10:58] i feel good now
[3:11:00] if he can do that in those situations he
[3:11:03] can do that in your situation and some
[3:11:06] of you are in the dream and some of you
[3:11:08] were going through some awful things
[3:11:11] but god turned it around
[3:11:14] for his glory and i want to say this
[3:11:17] not just to make it acceptable
[3:11:20] you know the outcome was
[3:11:25] okay we can deal with that no no no it
[3:11:27] was total transformation
[3:11:30] it was so miraculous and so glorious and
[3:11:33] so victorious that you couldn't even
[3:11:35] remember that it had been anything but
[3:11:37] that that's the god we serve
[3:11:39] we're going to sing that again and i
[3:11:41] want you to take your your situation
[3:11:45] i don't know how many people texted back
[3:11:47] and said that's right where i am right
[3:11:49] now i'm in one of those situations right
[3:11:51] now i've got to see god show up he will
[3:11:56] he may not come like you want him he may
[3:11:58] not come when you want him but he's
[3:12:00] coming
[3:12:01] he's coming and he's going to turn it
[3:12:03] around for his glory i want you to go
[3:12:06] after yours right now maybe it's
[3:12:07] physical maybe it's spiritual maybe it's
[3:12:10] emotional maybe it's your family maybe
[3:12:12] it's your job situation maybe you've got
[3:12:15] a burden for this church i don't know
[3:12:17] what you're carrying maybe you need
[3:12:18] direction maybe you need god to open
[3:12:20] doors i don't know what it is but it
[3:12:23] looks bleak it looks nearly hopeless so
[3:12:26] much so your mind has already determined
[3:12:29] how it's going to play out you've
[3:12:30] already seen the end in your own mind
[3:12:32] you know exactly it's going to get worse
[3:12:35] it's going to get worse you've got it
[3:12:37] all played out i want you to give that
[3:12:38] to god with me right now as we worship i
[3:12:41] want you to get prepared to give that to
[3:12:42] god because i'm telling you god's got an
[3:12:44] another ending to your story he's got
[3:12:47] another ending to your chapter another
[3:12:49] chapter
[3:12:50] another ending to your book

[3:12:56] that you did not see in the first place
[3:12:59] but god has had it in his heart the
[3:13:02] whole time and i'll tell you what it
