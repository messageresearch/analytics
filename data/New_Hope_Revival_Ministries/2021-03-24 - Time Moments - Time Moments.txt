TRANSCRIPT
========================================
god created time for you he didn't need time [Music] god created time for his purpose and his purpose is you so we can say that god created time for you he didn't need time everything that god was going to do for us he could have done for us in eternity but he created time because he wanted to accomplish some things in our life that are outside the perimeter of time they are eternal purposes and sometimes these eternal purposes become a process of unfolding revelation upon revelation upon revelation lying upon line upon line precept upon precept upon precept did you know that from the beginning god could have had a bride already dressed already perfect already like him did you know he could have absolutely skipped planet earth [Music] he didn't have to do it the way he did it he chose to do it the way he did it as a gift for you and i isn't that wonderful we never had to leave that third heaven that presence of god we never had to leave there in the first place we could have remained there he could have made us he could have spoke us into existence already in our highest form of perfection but there was an attribute in him that needed to be completed it needed to be manifested and that attribute was that of a redeemer and he cannot redeem if there's nothing that needs to be brought back to its original state so somebody has to be there and somebody has to fall and somebody has to have help and somebody has to call on help and then he comes rushing on the scene as a redeemer to pay the price to bring us into the perfect image that he had about us on his mind before the foundations of the world
