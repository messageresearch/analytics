========================================

Description:
There’s a great contrast between what we know and what we carry within us.  God’s Kingdom is established in the hearts of men.  Jesus did not come to establish a physical throne in Jerusalem at His first coming, nor did He change the political environment, but our promise is the fact that we are not only going back to Pentecost, but His Word has restored us all the way back Eden, and we must demonstrate who we truly are.  His Kingdom is established in the hearts of His Bride.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
lives are changed when we understand that we're a part of the kingdom of god you my brother sister have been born by the transforming and translating power of the holy spirit out of the darkness of this world out of the kingdom of men out of the kingdom of darkness out of the kingdom of this world and into the kingdom of god we look for the kingdom of heaven but we have already been translated into the kingdom of his dear son and that kingdom is an unshakable kingdom it is an unmovable kingdom in fact it's the original kingdom it's not the perverted one that we call planet earth the environment and society around us is a perverted society and a perverted atmosphere from the original that god created in eden we're not just going back to pentecost but the word has restored us all the way back to eden it means dominion it means authority it means a people who are so much in tune with the kingdom of god that they are not movable they are not shakeable lives are changed when we understand that we're a part of the kingdom of god there's a great contrast between what we know and understand around us and what we carry in us because even in the time of jesus we're told that his kingdom was not with a physical throne in a palace in jerusalem but his kingdom was in the hearts of men [Music] the kingdom of god was established in the hearts of men the roman occupation it just kept going on until finally it destroyed the city of jerusalem and burned the holy temple and so forth after christ had already gone so his coming didn't do too much to change the political environment because he wasn't here to preach another political kingdom he was here to preach and demonstrate the kingdom of god and when he sent the disciples forth he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of god and that means their whole focus was not kingdom of heaven because that was a future experience and expression when we get to heaven we know everything's going to be all right i want you to know we're not there yet we got to have something to hope in now we have to have something to hold on to now we need the kingdom of god among us now we need to understand who we are in the kingdom now we need to think like kingdom people now
