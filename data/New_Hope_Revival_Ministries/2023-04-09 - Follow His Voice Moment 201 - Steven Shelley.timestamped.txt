[0:00] way I challenge you in the name of the
[0:02] Lord Jesus Christ to leave here with
[0:04] this reality tonight you will have the
[0:07] Lord with you every step of the way if
[0:10] you are following his voice
[0:16] [Music]
[0:18] but as we begin to look at this Passover
[0:21] time and we begin to look at how God
[0:25] come down and move to the children of
[0:28] Israel out of Egyptian slavery and how
[0:31] they went from slavery to Sons
[0:34] and as God made a way where there was no
[0:37] way God was calling them out of Egypt
[0:40] but he didn't leave them to figure it
[0:41] out on their own he was there with them
[0:44] every step of the way how many of you
[0:46] believe that he opened up the Red Sea he
[0:49] opened up the Jordan River he fed them
[0:51] when they were hungry he gave them water
[0:53] when they were thirsty when the water
[0:56] was poisoned he gave them away to make
[0:58] it pure
[1:00] he was with him every step of the way I
[1:02] challenge you in the name of the Lord
[1:03] Jesus Christ to leave here with this
[1:06] reality tonight you will have the Lord
[1:09] with you every step of the way if you
[1:12] are following his voice
[1:15] if you're doing what he's telling you to
[1:17] do he will never leave you he will never
[1:20] forsake you
[1:22] if you don't obey him he may pull back a
[1:25] little bit and let you find out what it
[1:27] means to live in the permissive will of
[1:29] God but if you'll obey him if you'll say
[1:31] Lord I'm waiting but I'm ready I'm ready
[1:34] but I'm I'm waiting but I'm ready to do
[1:36] whatever you tell me to do
[1:38] I feel like the Lord is calling many of
[1:40] us not just a handful but many of us to
[1:44] a higher place of consecration where the
[1:47] Bantam said we've gone as far with God
[1:49] as we're going to go until we're willing
[1:50] to pay a greater price
[1:52] some of you are going to pay a greater
[1:54] price in this Supernatural year that
[1:57] we're living in right now but I
[1:59] encourage you now before it comes I
[2:02] encourage you now to know that he will
[2:04] provide he is Jehovah yareh he is
[2:08] Jehovah Jireh he is the god who will
[2:11] provide he will never ask anything of us
[2:14] that he will not provide for us
[2:18] he is involved in every aspect of our
[2:21] life that we will let him be
[2:23] he's a god of detail and he wants to be
[2:26] with you in your details
[2:28] can you trust him
[2:31] can you trust him is there anybody in
[2:34] this room that's ever found a reason not
[2:36] to trust God
[2:37] you say well I prayed one time and it
[2:39] didn't turn out the way I wanted it to
[2:42] turn out I want you to know we're not in
[2:44] charge here
[2:45] we're serving a sovereign-minded god
[2:49] who has a plan that's bigger than our
[2:51] plan he said I want to do for you
[2:54] exceeding abundantly above
[2:57] that which you could even ask or think
[3:00] foreign
[3:01] [Music]
