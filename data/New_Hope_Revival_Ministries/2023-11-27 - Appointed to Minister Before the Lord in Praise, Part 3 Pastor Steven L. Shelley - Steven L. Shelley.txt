His name as we prepare to move forward in the service with the needs of the body if you have a need here this morning you'd like to make it known by an uplifted hand I know that the Lord knows each and everyone we want to remember everyone that's still traveling to and from this place remember the ones that'll be out of town for a few more days even that the Lord a bless and be with them meet every need that they have amen Joshua still got about six hours of travel today I'd like for him to be lifted up sister Megan Kino is at home not feeling well sister christalin has a procedure tomorrow we're praying that the Lord will give her grace to go through it and and good report good results we there are about three of us four of us who have tried to get in touch with Sister Kate Daye over the last three or four days we were not able to do so which causes us to believe that she has either slipped into a coma or has perhaps passed we won't know my understanding from hers we would know for a few days but we would be notified would you pray that if she if she's in the last hours of her life which I sense that she possibly is that God will help her to have a very safe Crossing and if she has crossed pray that the Lord will uh will help those who cared about her she did have some loving neighbors and a cousin and uh and some of us that God will bring comfort and and help us to get through and that was all that I had again lots of people 30s something people traveling over the next few days to come home may God bring them all safe the roads are so dangerous amen also this just came to mind remember brother Dwayne and sister Heather Jackson that the Lord will surround them and his perfect will will be accomplished there I saw that they needed had a problem with the placenta and uh they reached out for prayer I'm sure they asked lots of people to pray but they called us and we prayed for them on the phone and the Lord instantly called caus the blood to clot and we're thankful for that it was the grace of God but she needs to be carried in prayer a few more weeks if the Lord would let the baby Terry uh she's what honey 30 33 weeks or she's about 33 weeks or something like that and and after a couple more weeks everything would be all right with no worries so they're not letting her travel right now but uh they said there's nothing she can do to prevent it or to cause cuse it so just ask the Lord to to comfort their hearts and heal her and give her grace to carry it as long as he wants her to carry it then a healthy baby girl amenis have been made but others need to be made all right let's remember those this morning praise the Lord Brother Austin Hodes would you mind coming and lifting these needs up this morning turn your eyes upon

remember your name or maybe you'd rather be at home in front of the hell Vision or but I'm so happy today to be in the presence of the Lord with those of like Precious faith we must not take it for granted we must be thankful for all that God has blessed us with we want to thank you for all your prayers for us while we were away we had a wonderful time what a what a blessing to live uh three and a half hours away from a a beautiful place that you could actually sit in the sun uh with a very small number of people very small on the day after Thanksgiving and not be cold wow we had uh seven days away and four of those days we were able to spend them on the beach it has to rain sometimes so we didn't Grumble about the rain when you see the cracked ground you know that the rain the the rain is needed but uh it was good to be together and with all of my children uh our children Joshua got to spend most of those days with us and then he took off to South Carolina when they get older and get love interest here and there well it's a little tougher isn't it so always pray for me I'll pray for you but we're just thankful for the time that we had together I know I don't know about you but I like my family I not only love them I like them and I enjoy being around them I'm so thankful that I don't have that Uncle you know the one I'm talking about Hallelujah Hallelujah we can talk about politics and nobody gets upset we can talk about Israel and nobody gets upset we can talk about the word of the hour and nobody gets upset isn't that wonderful amen and we are so thankful I understand that 17 hostages were just transferred into the hands of the IDF we want to thank God for the third exchange for their safe one of them was flown directly to a hospital in by helicopter in Israel because of needs yesterday one of the young ladies 21 22 years old uh had been had been shot 50 days ago on October the 7th and had been suffering ever since needed a surgery that was not lifethreatening but was very necessary for her wounds that she sustained on that day they literally shot her and then shoved her in the Jeep to take her captive and she was taken yesterday immediately to a hospital and received the surgery that she needed and we're very thankful for that we're thankful that one of the elderly women that that Hamas had reported as dead they had took pictures of her while she was sleeping and sent them around the world to say that she had died of natural causes it was a lie it never happened she was released un fortunately she found out that her husband had been murdered on October the 7th and her son was still being held captive by Hamas one of the most heartwarming things that I have seen in a long time was the daddy who spoke some weeks ago after the the event and had received word that his little daughter how old was she honey just 9 years old he had received word that his 9-year-old daughter had died died at the hands of Hamas and he was thanking God that she was no longer suffering and that she had been spared from further abuse not knowing what would happen well yesterday some days after that they got word that she was not dead that she was indeed alive so he had to get used to her death then he had to get used to the fact that no she was alive and she could be uh being tortured or abused but I believe that most all of that melted yesterday when she ran into his arms and if any of you saw that you will understand how important it is for us to pray check the list have you been praying over your list I've been praying over mine and God's doing some things uh two or three that have been on brother Grey's List have already been released and uh I think if you'll check your list you'll find out that that some of you were praying for for some of those that have been released and there'll be others listen I don't agree with a lot of things that are going on I don't think that we ought to have to give uh prisoners for hostages but it's a fact of life it's the only way in in a in a world like the one we live in it's the only way to be able to get these people home safely and the only way that this can continue and Hamas can be destroyed is to bring as many of uh not just Israelis there were four Internationals today um somebody should be asking our president somebody should be asking our president why no Americans have been released somebody should be asking the Jewish Democrats those Democrats in office those those Democrat senators and and uh uh those who serve in the House of Representatives someone should be asking them why they refuse to cry out about our American citizens that are being held captive by by Hamas and they won't do it they're silent they're so mouthy at other times but they're so silent now it's the world that we're living in and the only way to make a difference is to pray and you keep praying that God will bring those people home as many of them as possible and uh you may not pray like I pray but I pray for the total annihilation of Hamas as a as a terrorist entity it's the only way that Israel can have freedom those prisoners are being released in the West Bank which is Israeli and that means that if God doesn't arrest them they will continue their violence one young woman who was released was a prisoner because she had stabbed two Israelis in public who were doing nothing but standing on a street corner and they're releasing her back to do the same thing again it's a wicked world uh they're boasting that none of them have committed murder I assure you that it will be on their radar as soon as they have an opportunity to do it and uh prayer is all that we can do I will tell you one more thing and then be off of the subject if that was happening in this nation everyone would be screaming everyone would be crying out but because it's Israel if that was going on in UK if it was going on anywhere else but in Israel the whole world would be crying out and now I know why they used to show me in Jerusalem looking across the hom Valley over to the hill down just just up the hill from The Grove where Judas hung himself just up the hill from the place where Judas hung himself and the and the and the Potter's field that was used to purchase the money it's there and they know it's there by history the field that was purchased by by Judah is betrayal money you you find that field it's easy to find if you're standing if you're standing on on in the area of Mount Zion or close to the place where Schindler is buried you can look out across that Valley and you'll see the little plot down there where where poppers have been buried for thousands of years and you go up the hill there and you'll see some olive trees believed to be the very place where Judas committed suicide and then go up the hill a little higher there's a there's a row of buildings across there big nice buildings across the hill looking over Jerusalem and the Jews will tell you and the Christians will tell you that's the hill of evil Council it was from Bible times referred to as the hill of evil Council guess who guess whose headquarters sits there on the hill of evil Council today the United Nations there's probably not much more of a of a a wicked group than the United Nations they're Wicked they're not anything like people think they are and they're sitting there looking over they have found that many Hamas terrorists are serving with badges for the United Nations receiving a United Nations paycheck while they're murdering innocent Jewish people oh we need the Prince of Peace to help us we need him enough of that and and we have something to be thankful for and that is that there are some some uh hostages that are coming home not soldiers not there because they wanted to be there but they're because they were taken did you know some of those hostages had no idea the scope of what had happened they weren't all held together they had no idea the scope of what happened on October the 7th many of them didn't even know their loved ones were dead didn't even know they'd been murdered so now they have to come out of that condition and find out that their families have been taken from them I pray for their emotions because they're humans too no matter what the world thinks you can be a Jew and be a human Brother David man and I'm thankful to know that and I pray for their strength that God will help them guess what we are trending we are almost viral I think you could call it viral for a group this small size we have a real on in stagram that has 180,000 views it has over three 30 over 3300 likes and quite a few comments and that real alone has gained us 800 new followers on Instagram I tell you that's good that's good that's Mission work it hasn't all come without uh free it's come with a price because everybody doesn't find Our Praise beautiful like we do one comment was which I don't think I'll ever understand this one comment just said disgusting you know I have thought that some people got out of hand with their worship I think that some people worship like a like a like a you know under some kind of tradition and I don't like all the I don't like the the rosaries and all that kind but I i' I'd never thought about somebody's worship as being disgusting I might have thought to myself that's Antichrist but I've never thought it was disgusting when someone is doing something that they that they know to do or believ to do to worship God but don't let that discourage you because there have been hundreds of comments that have said I've never seen anything more beautiful than what looks like Amish people worshiping with other other other believers one woman said I have had no confidence in people dancing in the spirit and worshiping that way until I saw this real and I could feel the genuiness of this that's what we Rejoice about and I only got my kids kept saying you better come in daddy you need to come in aren't you going to come in aren't you going to come in I said I'm not going to comment till the last minute I want them to say everything they need to say and then I'll get involved and the one thing that stirred me out of my vacation was when someone said I looked them up and their brandom mites and when I when I read that I thought oh no little gal you can call me a lot of things but you're not going to call me that and get by I'm going to at least let the world know I am not that and I am preparing a two sermon series on why I am not a brand mind and I'll be preaching that for you in a few weeks I'm not going to carry that kind of a title I may appreciate fully the ministry of brother brandham but I neither worship him nor adore him the way that some people do I love him I'm thankful for him I do not believe that he was inherent I do not believe that he was infallible I do not believe that he understood everything he was just a Serv that God was using but even comments like that make people curious and they go to the website and they hear something they've never heard before and you're doing Mission work and all you're doing is sitting at home and God is using these things that sister Anna is putting together the thing the the the moments that brother H God's using them to reach people that we would never be able to reach otherwise aren't we blessed so I I need to announce that there will be Services next weekend Saturday night and Sunday morning we will go right ahead with our fellowship weekend even though brother Dwayne called he said you know I haven't been preaching long brother Shelley and I've never had to call and say that I won't be able to make it but but we let him know that we were expecting that call and we completely understood we wouldn't want her to do anything that would that would uh jeopardize her health or the health of that little baby but we're hoping that they will be with us on our February fellowship meeting uh we'll we'll get something going here Friday night H excuse me Saturday night and Sunday and hopefully by Tuesday night I'll be able to announce what we're going to do for food and fellowship uh I was waiting to hear

trip and and uh Zach and Liz are back from whatever that was they were doing in Colorado and uh and we're together today God is good 2 Chronicles chapter 20 beginning in verse 14 2 Chronicles chap 20 beginning in verse 14 then upon jahzel the son of Zachariah the son of beniah the son son of yel the son of matah a levite of the sons of Asaf came the spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation isn't that good and he said he had a voice he had a mouth he had a tongue he had words he said hearken ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and Thou King Jehoshaphat thus saith the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle Hallelujah for the battle is not yours but God's it doesn't matter whether we're talking about the war in Israel or whether we're talking about a situation of trouble in your life the battle is not yours The Battle Belongs to God if we can only remember that tomorrow go ye down against them behold they come up by the Cliff of ziss and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of yuel ye shall not need to fight in this battle that's a good thing set yourselves placement is an important thing in this hour to know where we're placed to be placed in the right place to be placed in the right position to be set s set and set yourselves stand can ye still and see the Salvation see Yeshua in your midst with you oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you and Jehosaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord they weren't praising now they fell before the Lord worshiping the Lord this was intimate time this was personal time it wasn't celebration it wasn't jumping and dancing and shouting out it was worshiping him bowed down before him and the Levites of the children of the coites and of the children of the chlorites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high so all you critics uh of of the real and the way we worship and you just think it's an un necessary to be emotional and unnecessary to be loud and it's not biblical and it has no place in the Bible and no no foundation in the Bible oh yes it does come on someone mockingly said Do You Believe Yeshua or Jesus and his disciples would worship this way my answer would be absolutely they did they didn't worship like a Catholic there were no Catholics they didn't worship like Pentecostals there weren't any Pentecostals they worshiped like Jews and Jews worship like the Bible said praise the Lord in the dance praise the Lord on the high sounding symbol praise the Lord with a loud voice so I have no reason to believe that they worshiped any differently than the presedent of the people and it was so common and so expected and such an acceptable expression of Praise that it doesn't even have to be mentioned in the New Testament because this is the way they were worshiping so all the Church of Christ people who say that instruments are not allowed in church because there are no instruments in the New Testament instruments were so much a part of praise and worship that they didn't even have to be mentioned in the New Testament it was never considered that anybody was ever going to have a problem because this is the common way the symbols were there the drums were there the stringed instruments were there it's just the way they did so people ought to be a little real and a little fairer and here's the problem they're trying to understand a hebraic Bible with a Greek mindset it's the same conflict that the prophets talk about in the Old Testament it's the sons of Greece and the sons of Zion Right In conflict with one another the sons of Zion know what pleases the father they know how to worship all right and the Levites and the children of the Kites and of the children of the kites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel how a loud voice with a loud voice on high that's what it says in my Bible may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated the battle is not ours God had a strategy to win this battle God has a strategy to win the battle in your life God knows better than anybody else how to get the victory he's a Victor somebody say Jesus is the Victor Jesus vict over every power over every principality over every demon come on over every evil influence over Hamas amen Jesus Is the Victor and he doesn't change up his strategy there may be some different pieces of the puzzle but if God used praise and worship to win the battle for Jehoshaphat he'll use praise and worship to win the battle in your life how many of you learning that because before you you you you fall down the rabbit hole of of complaining and murmuring and belly aing you remember whoa if I'll just take a moment and and show my gratitude and my thankfulness to God if I instead of murmuring about what I don't have if I'll just take a moment and thank him for what I do have and then at the end of that you just really don't even want to complain anymore because you realized how blessed you are how many of you know you're blessed you know it now uh we're talking about uh levite yahel son of Zachariah he was a levite and he was from the family of Asaf you know when you're reading the book of Psalm sometime you're reading the writings and the spiritual songs of King David but sometimes you are reading the the poetry and the spiritual songs of a levitical family a priesthood family a family of priests who come from the the the one man Asaf the sons of Asaf were priests and they were prophetic as you found out yeazel had a a yielding to the spirit of the Lord and the spirit of the Lord fell on him and used his voice and you this was before the gifts of the Spirit but here is a prophet a prophecy going forth from a priest and if you do a little research on Asaf you find out he was prominent as a singer and a Seer a Seer uh uh in David's court so he was both a singer and a priest and a songwriter and a prophet and God moved in his life life he's described as the chief of the Levites he had uh been appointed to minister before the Ark of the Lord what a privilege to stand before what was the ark of the Lord that was the Ark of the Covenant and Asaf had some descendants and one of those descendants was yeazel and he was appointed by his bread brethen under the inspiration of the voice of God to stand before the Ark of the Lord and Minister not to the people but to minister unto the Lord H we know I heard brother gy say last Sunday that we are ordained and anointed and and chosen spiritually as both priests and what else Kings we have authority to rule and have dominion in the spirit and we have authority as a priest to minister not only to others but for Forefront first of all and most importantly we have the privilege to minister unto the Lord anybody with me you can't really minister to the people until you understand the responsibility to minister unto the Lord every believer not just preachers not just not just those who have five-fold uh gifts but every person filled with the Holy Spirit has that a calling and an anointing to to serve as priest and King and we minister to one another as as priesthood of a new in the priesthood of the New Covenant but we first minister to the Lord how do we do that well I sang that you sang that a moment ago David was doing just that he was ministering unto the Lord when he said bless the Lord hello come on get with me bless the Lord oh my mind will and emotions yeah so I I if if real worship and real Ministry comes out of the inside of the inside that's spirit and it cannot it cannot be demonstrated from Spirit to flesh it it must pass through the inner dimension of man so it may originate in the spirit that's the only kind of praise and worship that God will honor is that that originates in spirit and in order for it to transfer itself to the demonstration of the body you know some people say well I have a feeling that he was in the flesh well I hope he was because if he wasn't in the flesh he was a disembodied spirit and I'm not interested in anything he does somebody said I saw him and he was just waving his arms and carrying on he must have been in the flesh sure he was sure he was his flesh is the only thing that God has given him to demonstrate what's happening in the Inner Man are you in the flesh when you raise up your hands and praise the Lord sure you are but your praise doesn't originate in your flesh it doesn't originate in your body it's origin Hallelujah is the inside of the inside that which originates that which is birth in the spirit passes through the realm of mind you've got to make it choice will and then what else emotions so yes praise and worship is going to be emotional because your emotions were given to you by God to help you express that's why we have emotions they run a they lead us wrong come on we respond emotionally sometime without faith and we respond negatively and in an ill way and it accomplishes nothing but your emotions are not your enemy your soul is not your enemy it's a gift of God to filter life it helps your spirit to be in touch with your flesh it's the middleman the breath of God's spirit ruach hakodesh the breath of the Holy Spirit went into a flesh body one made of the earth a D from the earth from the red clay he breathed breath into the nostrils of Adam the the dirt and Adam became a living Soul he was breath and body before he became a living Soul breath entered into a body before he became a living Soul his soul was given to him that he might remain in contact with his environment there is a a sense in our life that we we have to be connected to the environment around us and the atmosphere around us while maintaining our connection to God and without our mind without our will and without our emotions we would not be able to stay connected to Earth to reality to life to family to to obligations to jobs to the Natural Life that we must live if it were not for the mind and the will and the emotion ions the soul of man we would not be able to remain connected to the life around us to the Earth around us to the environment around us to the atmosphere around us and had it not been for mind will and emotion our spirit would not be able to always remain connected to God our creator and the inspiration of our life because there needed to be a way of expressing our gratitude our Thanksgiving so yes let me just boil that down for you there's going to be emotion in your praise there's going to be emotion in your in your worship now sometimes you hear Brother brandham speaking negatively about emotion and it's unfair for you and for anybody else including preachers to take a paragraph out of context and make it sound like he was against emotion listen to me carefully brother brandom doesn't have that privilege he cannot be against emotion he can't do that somebody said well it sounded to me like you didn't keep reading right he can't be against emotion because emotion is a part of the of the tripartate man anybody with me so you can't just say I'm against emot you can't be against emotion remember I told you that some people will say I'm not emotional until the cat dies and their life is over hello everybody has the ability to express emotion now some of us have been through so much we suppress our emotions and when we suppress emotions we form a toxic environment in our inner man God never intended for you to always suppress your emotions you have to learn to control them you have to learn you have to learn to express them without sin Don't Let the Sun Go Down on your wrath be angry be angry and sin not Bible said so let not the Sun go down on your wrath God doesn't care if sometimes you're angry that's it's how you express your anger that can get your spirit man in trouble that's good teaching this morning if you got to pound the wall you got to put a hole in the wall because you're angry you're out of line you're out of line when you do something like that when you kick an animal or kick a child or kick a hole in the door that's not all right there's a way to be angry and sin not what is that to control that anger find you something to do count to 10 go catch a fish go bake a cake go eat a cake I've been pretty angry before you know you got to let that out put you on some praise music find a way it's not sin to be emotional brother brandom couldn't be against emotion but what he was against is thinking that your emotions uh validate your experience you don't have the Holy Ghost because you were emotional right see he wasn't against speaking in tongues but he was against thinking that because you spoke in tongues you've got the genuine Holy Ghost he said it's got to be more than that you've got to live a life surrendered to every word of God are you with me so sometimes he's preaching on tongues as brother gy pointed out and it sounds like he's against it when he's indeed not against it how could he doesn't get the privilege of being against it because God is for it you can't be Godly and be against what God is for you can't be Godly and be for what God is against hello so tongues are important but they are not the initial evidence you can talk in tongues and be full of the devil you can get a tongue that'll you know tat tat and tat tie and do all kinds of things but if if your life is not reflecting the character of Jesus Christ you can't trust the tongue that's right same way with the emotion when you hear Brother brandom talking about emotion he's talking about people getting so emotional that they miss the word and they miss the importance of Revelation and they exchange a sensation for a real deep walk with with God are you with me yes but you got to have emotion he says to us multiple times no emotion no life are you with me now they don't have this but I don't have any quotes prepared today so I'll just go over here to my handy little notes and I'll just put in the word emotion and I'll just tell you see if I can pull up something here I don't remember if I called it emotions or [Music] emotional but I can find you some things here 64 paragraph one perseverant he said so I'm not much for dead things he he he'd be kind of miserable around folks who believe it's sin to show any emotion he said so anything without emotion is dead the scientific research will prove that anything without emotion so if your experience hasn't got a little emotion in it hello he said you better bury it and get something that has got some emotion in it that's right exactly true now I can go on and on and on and on see CU I'm still scrolling still scrolling that's not a man who was against emotion still scrolling still scrolling finally came to an end uh I I finished in 54 it goes from uh my quotes there are from like 65 backwards to 54 so 54 all the way up to 65 he's still telling us that there's going to need to be a little emotion in your religion because the lack of emotion in your religion is really a lack of life he said in anything that doesn't have life in it is good for only one thing bury it so you will find those quotes where brother brandham says some things about emotion and people people love their favorites but I'm going to do when I'm looking into something I'm going to do with it like I do Christmas I'm not going to just give you the quotes that prove my point I'm going to let you know that he says some things about emotion about the Pentecostal church about trusting in a sensation about getting worked up and missing the genuine experience between the connection are you with me between you and God but you can't take some instruction about emotion and how to find the balance in it and then turn around and tell me that he's against emotion emotion is a part of life it's a part of Praise it's a part of worship it's a part of loving somebody it's a part of being connected to somebody come on and when someone has repressed their emotions they build a a toxicity in their body that not only affects the way they connect to God it affects the way they connect with one another and it affects the way that their body operates so you want to find a way to have healthy emotions negative emotions that are not dealt with by the word and by the spirit become disease in the body so you want to deal with that stuff before it's starts dealing with you in a physical way you don't have to believe that it's a fact of brain science they now know that it has such a profound effect on the brain which is the which is the the hard drive of the entire body and they know that having the right attitude toward your sickness having the right attitude toward your situation drastically changes the outcome just by having the right dealing with with your emotions just dealing with it in the right way and not in a fanatical way I'm not here to encourage you to be fanatic but I'm here to encourage you not to deny or to suppress the fact that there will be emotion in our praise but we're not going to leave here and say I know I'm a Child of God because I jumped up and down is anybody going to say that let me look around is there anybody that's going to think because you felt a little whoos that you're God's child that whoos is the is the is the confirmation that you're right no no no no no the confirmation that you're God's child is his word it's not how you feel but we're going to feel and we're going to lift up a loud voice on high and we're going to bow in our faces sometime and Worship the Lord because that was God's strategy for battle it was then and it is now and so Asaf one of the chief Levites was appointed to minister before the Ark of the Lord and he and his brothers were appointed appointed appointed it's an important thing to note to sing the songs of Thanksgiving to the Lord I want to I want to talk a little bit about being appointed to praise the Lord I it's not just our reaction it's not just what we do but we really have an appointment by God as an end time bride to keep our lives engaged with him through praise and worship we maintain do you understand that I said do you understand that we maintain our connectivity with God we maintain our relationship with God by our response you know I was taught that when you're spoken to you respond to someone of any age other than yours and you might ought to start practicing now I was taught that you respond to a man by saying yes sir doesn't mean he's over you your lost man your dad it just means you're respecting him as a person so yes sir is a response yeah I need a little help here yeah is not a proper response I'm going to say it again I'm not going to accept that I've lived too long here on the earth I'm not going to accept that kind of a response yeah I'm not going to accept yeah Y which is not a word you can say yes or you can say yes sir you can say no or you can say no sir that's an acceptable response I'm going to give you the same respect I'm going to give you the same courtesy you're going to need to teach your children to show that kind of respect because it's important in this day where there is no respect on you you should show that respect you'd be surprised how opening the door for a Stranger by pausing an extra minute to let another group come out or let another group go in you'd be surprised how most of the time it will generate a response of gratitude back I've said this before and if this sounds racial or Prejudice I pray you'll forgive me but I I try to be mindful to let people come in and to hold the door stay a little extra when they say thank you I sound like a Chick-fil-A uh employee I always respond my pleasure and it is it is a pleasure to do an act of kindness for somebody else but if that person happens to be a black woman or even a black man I go out of my way I pause extra long I'll stay extra long to hold the door for them because I want them to know in my mind and in my heart they are worthy of the same respect it's vitally important in this hour you may have to practice on a little Mexican fellow or a little Asian woman you may have to go a little bit beyond to show a little extra kindness and a little extra respect but you would be surprised how far that goes oh my it goes so far in the Hostile society that we live in today we we we should have a proper response when we're spoken to when God does something in our life we ought to have a proper response uh Thanksgiving and praise and later worship is just an overl flow of what we recognize God doing in our lives and we should recognize that there is a sound that he wants to hear a song that he wants to hear a people that he wants to hear from above all other people you can say all day long to me I enjoy are you listening folks you can say to me all day long I enjoyed the sermon I enjoyed the message I enjoyed the service and I'm always blessed to hear that but if my wife ever says that to me if she ever says honey that was a good service I really enjoyed that service I really enjoyed what you had to say this morning how many of you know it it it doesn't silence your voice it doesn't negate my gratitude for you saying it but she's my my sweetheart and when she says to me you did a good job it's supposed to be that way way when your wife says something to you when your husband says something to you when they stop to thank you for something and and and and yes I believe it's a wife's place to take care of her husband the best she can and to provide a meal for him but that doesn't mean that he shouldn't be thankful for it I I've had women come here through the years and tell me when they first got married their husband threw their food in the trash I I'm going to tell you something I'm not a woman but if I had have been I'd I'd have wanted to go throw all of his underwear in the trash listen I've I've eaten some meals in my lifetime that weren't the best it's been years ago my wife Came From Another World excuse me another country Canada and she had to learn a few things about southern eating she had to learn that there are more vegetables in the world than carrots then she had to learn but I did my [Applause] best to to find something to say my children to this day thank their mother for the meal when we go out to eat and I buy the meal they say and sometimes I say to them uh uh Benjamin particularly I'll say honey You' thanked me three times you don't have to thank me again you're welcome you're welcome I wanted to do it but how many of you know it makes us feel good it does it does it's my job I'm going to do it it's my place it's it's what I want to do I'm I'm a patriarch it's what I want to do in my family when I can but oh how nice it is to have response well this is kind of what praise is it's a response to him and he wants to hear Above All Else above all there's going to be a lot of Hallelujah is lifted up in this nation today most services are over by now there were a lot of Hallelujah lifted up this morning lot of amens lot of praise the Lords lot of oo and us but he would rather hear from you he wherever his bride is gathered together today you're Hallelujah help me somebody you're amen you're praise the Lord when the elect responds when the bride says praise God hallelujah when the wife of the bridegroom gives him thanks gives him praise it catches him it catches and captures his heart in a way that theatrics cannot do it light shows and churches with coffee shops and tattoo parlors and colored lights on the backdrop and smoke and the first thing you do when you go into modern church today turn off all the lights Turn All the Lights On does does that make you comfortable some years ago I went to preach in a church in Ohio somewhat message somewhat nothing and the first night I went in it's a little old country looking Church the first night I went in you know it's just just pews just little plain looking little building you go in worship go they turn the lights off and I sat there for a while and I grew more uncomfortable by the minute and I thought I can't do anything about it they sit in my church and then I thought hey you brought me here because you wanted me to help you in some way now I'm going to go I walk right back to where the pastor was and I said listen if you want I'll go ahead and preach tonight but if you want me to stay the rest of the weekend turn the lights on he said brother are you serious I said said I'm as serious as I've ever been in my life I'm uncomfortable sitting in the dark I don't know who's here I don't know who's coming and going and I don't know why we have to turn the lights off to welcome Jesus he's not afraid of the dark he doesn't have to have it dark he didn't come in slipping through the Shadows I I realize that he's not afraid of the dark but he don't have to have it in the dark you turn on the lights we're Children of the light and you know what the pastor did it and he did it with a good attitude and God blessed his church and blessed his family and blessed his people and there were some of them including the pastor there were two or three people that I can think of right now in those meetings that are now in the presence of the Lord died early age stricken by different things and taken out but I was able to rest knowing that they had really had a breakthrough in the spirit we gathered GED in a home and fellowship with the family that had been so broken and so abused by church and to see the love that was being shown and the way they were coming out of their shell and I was so glad that I obeyed the Lord by something as simple as saying hey turn on the lights in here we're not here for a concert we're not here for some kind of show we're not here to be entertained we're here to minister see a lot of you just came to be ministered to I pray God will meet you but some of us came today to minister to the Lord and we realize that as his bride it's not our option it's our appointment just like there were sons of Asaf appointed as singers and praisers and Priests to serve the Lord Lord to minister unto the Lord his bride has been appointed to worship him to minister before the Lord in Praise we're appointed to do it how many of you want to do what you were created to do you want to do what you were appointed to do I want you to know there are times that God gets no glory in noise but you let that noise come out of his bride you let her get excited about him coming in that's what we're doing we know that if we praise him he comes we know that if we glorify him he comes and oh does he want to come he wants to come so as we read in 2 Chronicles 20 the next morning I'm moving on the next morning yahosh ofhat appointed singers unto the Lord and they were to go out preceding the Army I'm going to send the weapons stay with me I'm going to send the Warriors but before I send the weapons and the soldiers and the Warriors I'm going to send the praisers I'm going to send those who have no other commission except to praise they've been appointed to respond and Minister unto the Lord come on now and and you know what God misses you when you don't respond to him everybody else can be responding but when you're not doing what you were appointed to do he misses your voice he misses your song you see sometimes I can tell what kind of weak people have by how many start out here in the front some people come to church just wanting us to know that you fought hell this week well guess what lollipop so did everybody else we faced hell we faced the devil we faced rude crazed insane people we ate in the same restaurants that other people eat in where you're sitting there wondering do I say ma'am do I say sir do I say It come on I don't even know what to say we Face the same ugly everybody that belongs to God we Face the same ugly in the world but we don't have to come in here and show everybody how battle scarred we are for the week oh if you want to show what you've been through do it with praise do it by respon yes sir yes sir yes sir Lord I'm here today not just to be minister to but I'm here to minister to [Music] you because when we Minister unto the Lord we're pulled up higher into his presence if you believe that say Amen so go back to verse 18 and I'm going to read all the way to verse 24 in 2 Chronicles chapter 20 uh and Jehoshaphat or Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all Judah Yehuda Yehuda means this time I will praise the Lord all Yehuda and the inhabitants of yerushalaim fell before the Lord worshiping the Lord and the Le Levites of the children of the coites and the children of the kites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high now let's read on and they Rose early in the morning and went forth Into the Wilderness of tecoa and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me oh Yehuda and ye inhabitants of jeruselam believe in the Lord your God go how important it is you believe faith is important how many of you believe faith is important how many of you believe real faith can meet every challenge I know that I know that I know that I know that I know I know not because I felt him not because I had a sensation not because the hair stood up on my but I know because the word said so I'm not trusting in how I feel I'm trusting in the word but because I put my trust in the word he allows me to feel to experience so that I can respond hello Hallelujah they went forth Into the Wilderness of tooa Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me oh Yehuda and ye inhabitants of jeruselam believe in the Lord your God so read it with me so shall ye be established you want a foundation believe in the Lord Believe In the End Time message of the hour believe in the revealed word of God believe in what God is saying in this hour get a hold of it embrace it take it back to the Bible if it meets the Bible you've got a foundation to stand on and you shall be established if you believe the Lord then he goes on to say believe His prophets s so shall ye Prosper so the question is do you just want to be established or do you want to be established and prosper how many of you want to be established and you want to prosper then believe in the Lord and Believe In His prophets you shall be established and you shall prosper that's what I believe and when he had consulted with the people how's everybody doing are you here to get something accomplished did you sleep okay are you ready to get the job done he consulted with the people then he appointed someone say appointed let me tell you something if God appoints he anoints if man appoints but if God appoints he's obligated himself to anoint Hallelujah if God gives a real Vision he releases the provision to cover the vision if God appoints someone to praise him he's going to release the anointing they need to do whatever it is that they're called to do and part of your calling I just don't know what I what I'm to do I don't know where I fit in this thing let me just go ahead and tell you today you may be an apostle you may be a prophet you may be a pastor teacher an evangelist you may have some form of pull pit Ministry I don't know I can't say unless he shows me I can't confirm any of that but I'll tell you what I can confirm that if you're a part of the end time bride of Jesus Christ you have been appointed to praise the Lord in this hour you've been appointed to praise Him you've been called to praise you were born to praise him as they went out before the Army listen he said he appointed singers unto the Lord that they should praise the beauty of Holiness that's not your Holiness the only thing that makes you holy it's not your long hair here's where people always listen to me it's not your long dress that makes you holy it's not your La lack of makeup that makes you holy come on it's not a man not gambling getting away from pornography or any of the sort that makes him holy the only thing that makes anything holy is when God gets in it remember the bush I don't have to preach on the bush do I it was just an ordin bush until one day God said I'm getting in that bush and he came down crawled in that bush and Moses had to take off his shoes because not only did the Bush become holy but the ground around it became Holy Ground why because Moses was there no because God chose the bush and then he put himself There You Are Holy because you're chosen of the Lord and appointed of the Lord and he has put himself In You by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's good preaching appointed singers unto the Lord that they should praise the beauty of Holiness his Holiness Lord have mercy if you can't think of anything else to say you can say you're holy that's You Are Holy brother the value of his Holiness is the the fullness of the value of his Holiness is yet to be seen But as the world gets darker and uglier and more putrifying every day that we live come on more disgusting every day we live his Holiness becomes more valuable oh to sit a few minutes to sit a few minutes in the Holiness of the Lord to know that he who is Holy has come down to inhabit the Praises of his people in a minute we're going to get out from R of that and we're either going to go home and eat leftovers or we're going to go out into the world and you're going to you're going to run across anything and everything some of you're going to have a waitress that despises you because of the way you look simply because of the way you look she hates you to her already already you're a religious fanatic if you had blue on your eyes if you were showing your cleavage if you were melted and poured in a pair of of pants britches you slithered in like the world slithers everywhere they go have you ever watched out people Slither wherever they go you'd fit in and she'd be glad to serve you not every waitress some recognize the Holiness of the Lord on you and will reward you will treat you respectfully because you'll get a whole lot more of that than the in the South than you will in other places because we're in the Bible Belt and you will meet people you will meet people now when I'm out and my family's out in the in the shopping we went shopping in the outlets while we were there and we meet all kinds of Holiness people and and it's a shame because most Holiness people will barely speak to one another because they're they don't know what flavor they are and they hardly ever speak to me because I have a beard and they've already decided if you've got a beard you can't be you couldn't be Pentecostal UPC and have a beard you couldn't be much of anything what a shame it is that people who have so much in common can't even hardly speak to each other but I watch them watching us they'll show you a little bit of respect some of you will meet people angry and you don't even know why they're angry cut you off shoot you a little birdie and you don't even know what you did and you're going to be like me tempted to want to say I'll I'll show you what to do that finger I'll I'll snap it right off if you keep doing but you can't do that you can't do that you can get angry but you can't sin V silence is sin come on you don't even know why but it's simply because the world recognizes that you've made a stand for something and we're living in an hour where that is very very hated and when we continue and we will continue to face those things that's when we're going to begin to realize the Beauty and the value of being in his holy presence oh Hallelujah there's nobody in here to despise you there's nobody in here to mistreat you because you're godly you just come together in the presence of the Lord we might not like everything about every person but when we get in here we're not supposed to be looking at one another we're supposed to be looking at the Lord you're not supposed to be judging the length of someone else's skirt you're supposed to be looking at God hello the only way a body can function in this hour is if we can learn to look to him you look to him the same holy ghost that that convicted me can convict you I'm going to give the Holy Ghost an opportunity to help you and if you won't let him help you I'm going to help you I'm going to help you because I realize that if you let down the bars and you keep letting the bars lower and lower and lower that holy God that Holy presence of God he's no longer attracted when you get together he's no longer attracted to come and be a part of your Gathering because there's nothing there like him your Holiness your separation from the world your desire to yield to your appointment as a as a praiser and as a worshipper these are some of the things that draw him into our midst and he wants to sit right down on top of a people just sit right down just just come in here and hang right down here Among Us and meet every need that we have without a prayer line without a prayer line he just wants to come and meet our needs aren't you glad for that that they should praise the beauty of Holiness and they went out before the Army and why did they go out before the Army to say to say praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever praise the Lord help me for his mercy endureth forever praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever praise the Lord for his Mercy endure forever the enemy is standing there watching and here comes this rag tag bunch of praisers Praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever praise the Lord for his Mercy endure praise the Lord for his mercy endureth forever and they just we expected swords you sent these in that can't even carry a tune in a bucket but they said praise the Lord for his Mery mercy endureth forever let's read and when they began to sing and to praise can you see it the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon Moab and mount Seer which were come against Judah and look what happened read that for me would you and they were SM [Music] smitten what about the soldiers what about the swords what about no when they began to sing and praise the Lord when Judah began to sing when Judah began to praise the Lord hallelujah when Judah began to say praise ye the Lord for his mercy endureth forever the Lord said that's what I want to hear he come right down in the midst he set up Heavenly ambushments against the the enemy and they were smitten somebody say again they were smitten they were smitten or the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount sier utterly to slay and Destroy them and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of zier everyone helped here come a a a group of groups that all wanted Israel dead but Israel didn't sweat it they just sent Judah first these are the appointed ones just like this little bride has been appointed to praise and when that Judah went forth and they began to praise the Lord God set ambushments against them and the next thing you know they turned against one another and destroyed each other so that the battle could be won this is not the only time God won a victory like that he knows how to make your enemies be at peace with you because he turns them against one another and they just start fighting one another you'll just wait till some of these Terror groups get mad with one another and turn them loose on each other don't you folks sleep on Saturday night why are you so sleepy in here everyone helped to destroy another and when Judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness they looked unto the multitude and behold there were dead bodies Fallen to the Earth and none escaped what kind of weapons did they use praise what caliber of bullets Praise on what did the catapults look like praise come on no axes no sins no no stone throwing how did the victory get won praise are you emphasizing praise I am this is a picture or type of what praise can cause to happen in the spirit realm during times of spiritual warfare many strategic shifts can take place because the people Gather in United praise come on come on took a lot of you took took quite a few of you a while this morning morning to get with us I'm going to suggest that some of you should have been in the bed earlier last night I'm going to suggest that some of you ought to reorder your Saturday nights so that you can be ready to do what you're appointed to do on Sunday morning I know some folks aren't going to like this but I want you to know your children need a bedtime on Saturday night if they don't have one the rest of the week put them to bed somebody said what if they get up put them again you're you know that's how it works don't you right I'm not just concerned about children up at 11:00 on a Saturday night when we're supposed to come to church I'm concerned about parents that are up 12 one and then come in here not doing what they're appointed to do I'm not mad see I'm smiling did I smile like a jack of' Lantern I I mean it you don't take this serious do you I know some of you do we've been appointed yes you weren't appointed to come here and sleep you've got beds to sleep in you've got pillows at home you were appointed to come here as a as a unified Army you're Judah this morning to praise the Lord to praise the Lord to praise him in the beauty of his Holiness because there's a battle raging around this anybody with me I'm telling you as I told you a few weeks ago and you may not have heard it until it was too late we've got to get ready we've got to get ready we've got to get prepared we've got to get ready well I've had a cold all week you're not the only one come on but my throat is so sore I could hardly be here today you're not the only one quit waiting on somebody to pet you and get up and do what you were appointed by the Lord Lord to do he's not asking you to bring your swords he's not asking you to March out with bombs and gun he's asking you to go forth in Praise only two times to praise the Lord when you feel like it and when you don't and if you'll praise him when you don't feel like it you'll get a lot further anybody with me what if I told you that praise is a higher work of the Lord than missionary work what have I told you that praise is one of the highest orders callings appointments that you can have as a servant of God in this hour because if you'll do what you were appointed to do angels will do the work amen Heavenly hosts will do the work they'll uncover what you can't uncover hello they'll deal with what you and I can't deal with if we'll do what we were OED to do if we'll be faithful to do what we were appointed to do the Lord will take care of the rest is anybody with me Psalm 22 if you'll put it up please I need a few more minutes Psalm 22 1-3 my God my God I think I read this recently why hast Thou forsaken me why art thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring oh my God I cry in the daytime but thou hearest not in the night season and and am not silent but Thou Art holy but Thou Art holy oh thou that inhabited the Praises of Israel remember that means to remain to stay to T to to take a seat to take a throne so it could be easily read as we've been preaching the theme even brother really referred to it last Sunday enthroned in the Praises of Israel to become an embodiment of praise to become the enthronement of Praise he sits enthroned on our Praises Hallelujah the shout of the king the shout of the Lord in the in the mouth of the Saints he chooses to dwell to live in our in our Praises I want you to give me Psalm 55:17 and I'll wait on you anybody still here good I didn't come to play I don't think you came to play did you honey I left the beach to be here today I'm serious about being here Psalm 55:17 it's in the notes I know you have it you might just have to look for it a minute but I know there it is thank you evening and morning and at noon will I pray this is David and cry aloud and he shall hear my voice how many times a day did David say he prayed three times evening morning and at noon evening morning at noon evening morning and at noon why in the evening because that's when the day begins according to God's calendars evening and morning and at noon will I pray and cry aloud and he shall hear my voice voice yet in another Psalm Psalm 119 verse 164 and 165 David says something else Psalm 119 there we go seven times a day you getting the math here seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments great peace have they which love thy law oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh you're not listening are you great peace have they which love thy law and what say it again say it again nothing and nothing shall nothing say it again nothing nothing shall offend them he hurt my feelings she hurt my feelings she didn't brag on my dress she didn't like my tie I want to tell you something if you're dressing to please people you there are certain people born in this earth that would love it but never tell you they're Twisted life has Twisted them I'm not being ugly there there are people who who have so such an awkward response to everything in life that they could think that's a prettiest dress they've ever seen in their life but they would never tell you they might tell somebody else didn't you think that was a pretty dress but they wouldn't tell you there's something wrong with that if but if you're waiting on someone to brag on you I I just tell you what I do I bought me a new rain jacket while I was away and I don't wait on nobody to brag on me I just walked into the room where all the family was and I said y'all like my new rain jacket and everybody said we sure do I go put it away if you need validation ask for it we not only preach the gospel here we help you live if you need somebody to brag on you find them find somebody and say Hey how do I look I want to tell you something though there's a few around here that might tell you you you better not need that kind of you didn't come here to show off your frock you come here to give God praise David said seven times a day do I praise the Lord because of thy righteous judgments do do you get it David was inspired by the Holy Ghost when he acknowledged the importance of praising he praised at least twice as much as he asked this should become our habit this should become our discipline to praise more than we ask how many of you'd like to be a person that thank twice as much David praised more than he prayed and I tell you what he got more because he praised more he got more he received more because he praised more he took his appointment seriously who'll do that he'll do that furthermore David didn't think he could do all the praise so he chose some folks he appointed Levites to play alteries and harps to exalt thank and praise God before the Ark of the Covenant let's look at this here in 1 Chronicles 16 and we're closing shortly you know shortly is a Relevant Word 1 Chronicle 16 you you had two services off you had nice brother gy for two Services now the mean pastor's back 1 chronicles 16 veres 4-6 and he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the Lord and to record and to thank and praise the Lord God of Israel you see God talks when we praise God inspires us when we pray he talks to us in our thoughts sometimes when we praise he inspires words to our heart sometime when we praise Asaf the chief and next to him Zachariah yel Sha excuse me shimo shimar uh yil and oh my matei and elab maybe elab and you know the rest OED Edom and yeriel with Su trees and with Harps but Asaf oh ASAP made a sound with symbols not rubber ones real clashing symbols Asaf put that Amen in there I can't make a s can anybody make a symbol sound I I said symbol not a leaky balloon symbol I'm kidding you did well you did well and and benah also and yeazel the priest with [Music] trumpet continually before the Ark of the Covenant of God hallelujah you've got singers singing you got Su suering you got symbols clashing you've got trumpets blasting standing before the ark appointed every man knew what he was supposed to do GL GL nobody had to say give me a little more symbol everybody knew what they were supposed to do and they did it unto the Lord isn't that beautiful little bride we too have been appointed as priest unto our god oh Lord I want to tell you something I I want to minister to you I want to encourage you I want to correct you when you need it I want to bless you but I have a higher calling my my highest calling first and foremost everything else must flow out of that High Calling The High Calling of God on my life is to minister to him I know you want to bless one another pray for one another encourage one another show acts of kindness to one another but your first commission is to minister to the Lord how many of you want to put a smile on his face so to speak oh Hallelujah I I want to live in such a way it pleases the master I believe you you desire that too well little bride we too have been uh appointed it is preached unto our God to minister unto the Lord with our Thanksgiving and with our praise I'm going to read this and and I really am going to just stop uh save a little for Tuesday night Revelation 5 verse 9 and 10 and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue people and nation and has made us made us unto our God read it for me please Saints Kings and PR Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth Revelation 20 and6 blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priest of God and of Christ and shall reign with him finish that for me would you a thousand years look at 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 9 and 10 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood those who Minister those who are appointed to minister unto the Lord not just with praise and worship but with our laid down life but it starts with praise and worship a holy nation A peculiar people remember that that's the segula that that's not see how weird you can get some of you are taking it way too serious practicing your peculiars don't practice your peculiars it doesn't mean see how different and odd and weird and strange and thinking religious you can behave it means exclusively one's own treasure it means you are A peculiar people under the Lord you're his most prized possession that you should show forth the Praises hello appointed appointed you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who hath would you finish that for me call you out of Darkness somebody turned on the lights he called us out of Darkness into His Marvelous Light which in time passed were not a people here's the one new man here's the grafted Gentile who in times past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not a obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy in the New Testament Church there was a council of the Brethren and they met together to decide what kind of law would be inflicted upon the Gentiles must they be circumcised must they do this must they follow that must they do the other and the and the the summary is given to us in the Bible we should never forget the balance of the scripture this was placed there because there are certain things that are required of Jews that are not required of the Nations I know a lot of people have a problem with that I didn't say it the book said it the New Testament tells us that we as Gentiles should not eat eat things that are that are that die in their own blood there are certain requirements that that we must obey how could the disciples how could the apostles let Nations off the hook because God was already building a one new man and he knew that the temple would not stand in the Earth for thousands of years but that God was building a temple in the hearts of men and women and that there would come a day under a New Covenant and remember the newer Covenant does not do away with the old Jesus said think not that I am come to destroy the law but I am come to fulfill the law that word fulfill means to fill it all up and let me tell you something there's nothing there's no one there's nobody that has ever fulfilled the righteousness of God Like Jesus Christ like Yeshua the Messiah he was the word in flesh that one new man I that that Peter is even talking about here he's not just talking to the Jews here when he talks about a nation he's not just talking about the nation of Israel here no read Romans 11 he's talking about a grafted in people who have now become a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a nation of priests A peculiar people and he says clearly which in time past were not a people he's not talking about Jews there but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy Mercy but now have obtained Mercy Hallelujah I don't want to go into the next section so I'll have the musicians to come back and we'll we'll go there on Tuesday evening before we we finish this series I want you to to leave here today pondering your appointment you are called elected PR destined to be the bride of Christ your number one responsibility in the last days is to reflect him and how do we reflect the word how do we reflect the character of the bridegroom we enter into close contact fellowship and intimacy with him and how do we enter into close contact and fellowship and intimacy with him we do it by building him a throne to sit on in our midst and the throne that he wants to sit on in our midst is not a chair it's our hearts he wants to be enthroned in our Praises he wants us to become the embodiment of Thanksgiving the embodiment of Praise he wants to ride in on our worship on our praise on our response when he
