[0:06] understand that
[0:09] as Believers of this end time truth that
[0:12] God allowed that same Pillar of Fire to
[0:15] come down at Shavuot in the upper room
[0:20] and divide itself one great
[0:23] manifestation of God now divided into
[0:27] individual little licks of fire
[0:30] appearing over their head and that same
[0:34] light I want to say this again it
[0:36] divided itself
[0:38] you see God is in the multiplying and
[0:42] dividing business
[0:44] he both multiplies and he divides
[0:48] and so on that day he both multiplied
[0:52] and he divided
[0:55] he divided himself
[0:58] because he was that light
[1:00] he was that fire
[1:01] he was that cloud amen same
[1:05] manifestation the Bible is clear that
[1:08] was God that wasn't an object lesson
[1:12] that wasn't just a symbol it was a
[1:16] manifestation of God so if the pillar of
[1:21] fire is the anointing and the pillar of
[1:24] fire is a manifestation of God I want
[1:27] you to understand that when the
[1:29] anointing comes
[1:31] he comes like a person
[1:34] not a Feeling
[1:37] but he comes as a manifestation of God
[1:41] if the pillar of fire is a manifestation
[1:44] of God did you know the anointing
[1:47] is also a manifestation of God not a
[1:51] Feeling
[1:52] it's really God showing up in the house
[1:56] and the pillar of fire is a
[1:58] manifestation of God
[2:00] amen
[2:02] and uh
[2:07] so are you
[2:12] because you are a word
[2:15] sent from God
[2:17] and the Bible said that God is very very
[2:20] particular about his word
[2:23] and not any of his word none of it will
[2:28] return to him void
[2:31] and what that means is it will not
[2:33] return to him not having accomplished
[2:37] all that he sent it to accomplish and
[2:42] that includes you
[2:44] you must see yourself as a part of that
[2:48] word
[2:50] a part of that fire a part of that
[2:54] anointing
[2:55] we are the anointed
[2:58] did you know anything that the anointing
[3:00] falls on it becomes anointed of God
[3:03] did you know on that day that the pillar
[3:06] of fire fell on the mountain it chose an
[3:09] ordinary Bush if I know anything about
[3:11] God's character he chose the loneliest
[3:14] bush
[3:16] [Applause]
[3:19] he chose Bethlehem
[3:22] chose to make him a Galilean
[3:25] he chose Shepherds to sing about his
[3:28] birth to go tell the good news about
[3:31] this verse why it had to be Shepherds
[3:35] so if I know anything about the
[3:37] character of God he didn't say let me
[3:39] look down here and see the most amazing
[3:41] Bush I can use it it was more or less
[3:44] most likely that it was just a scrub
[3:49] God said that one will do
[3:52] when God crawled into that bush and it
[3:56] began to burn with a fire and the fire
[4:00] could not consume the bush
[4:02] God protected the bush so that he
[4:07] preserved the bush so that it burnt but
[4:10] was not yet consumed
[4:14] so when was that bush most important
[4:18] when God was in the bush
[4:20] when the fire was on the bush
[4:23] was the bush holy before the fire or
[4:26] after the fire
[4:27] it was holy when the fire came
[4:33] if we were denominationally minded we
[4:35] would say as soon as the fire left the
[4:38] Bush was still holy and we would build a
[4:40] shrine and we would paint a picture of
[4:43] it and we would make an icon in the
[4:46] Church of it and we would have people do
[4:48] the sign of the cross when they passed
[4:50] the picture of the Bush because we like
[4:53] to put the holy
[4:55] in common things
[4:57] and make them big things
[5:00] and we do that with religious intent and
[5:05] not sincere Hearts so I don't know what
[5:08] the bush looked like after but I want
[5:09] you to know as long as the fire of God
[5:12] was on that bush an ordinary Bush was
[5:15] made into a holy bush
[5:17] and as long as you and I have the very
[5:20] life of God inside of us
[5:26] doesn't matter what we were five seconds
[5:28] before he came
[5:33] when he puts himself in US
[5:36] we become a holy Bush
[5:38] we become a holy people
[5:44] foreign
