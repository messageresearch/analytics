TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit [Music] but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right I Christ in you the hope a lord [Music] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of New Hope revival ministries and we're coming to you today on behalf of the gospel channel our wonderful friend and brother Eric Erickson all of the staff of the gospel channel we greet you we salute you in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior our soon coming King we are so excited about the things that the Lord is doing my family and I just returned from a Bible conference in North Carolina and we were so blessed to be with the Saints of God and singing the songs of Zion and hearing the Word of God preached the theme of that meeting was our future home that's the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride of which I believe I'm apart and I'm trusting that you are also pressing into Christ in this hour so we came home a little bit tired but revived in our spirit it's good to be refreshed in your spirit man and we're really blessed to have the gospel channel as one of the ways that we can be blessed and we can be refreshed you know it feels a little bit like a paradox to me sometime because television has never been a part of my life I lived without a television and it has never been something that was of great interest to me through the years and so so many of my friends laugh and they think it is quite a paradox that God would open the door that he has opened for us to be able to speak to you by the means of television it's the grace of God that's what it is it's the grace of God and we have to have enough a discernment in the realm of the Spirit to know when God's opening a door and so I'll say to you again there's a lot of things on the television that are absolutely rotten no good but I am so grateful and so thankful that God has given us a pulpit to the nation's brother Eric Erickson we salute you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because over twenty years ago you had a burden you had a vision to start with a radio receiver in your beautiful country of Iceland and that expanded to now a television network that's reaching many many nations with the gospel and without you without you viewing the program and without your partnering with the gospel channel that would not be possible we are so blessed today to have a wonderful brother with us it always makes me feel good it gets lonely on here sometime when I'm by myself and so I'm always happy to have a friend with me and today we have brother Gerald Hicks who is a now at this particular moment an evangelist but he has pastored and has had a ministry for many many years we're going to get to know him today so whatever you do leave it right where it is don't this is not a time to go channel surfing with the remote because brother Hicks has a testimony that I believe it is the will of God for you to hear and I believe it's going to encourage you because he has had a life that has not been what we might say ideal it certainly has it been usual but it has been exactly what God has ordained it to be to get him to where he is today so that he can be mightily used of the Lord he was preaching for us in our church last night and we were blessed and it was one of those sermons where you want to go back and hear it again and again because you know there was rich rich food what we call eagle food that kind of food that strengthens us to press into Christ and we're delighted to have him with us today and before we get to know brother Hicks I want to share just a portion of Scripture that I woke up with this more I believe the Lord was speaking to me about you I really do I believe that we're going to be taping this program and we're going to do another program a little bit later with brother Hicks and I believe that God already knows in his foreknowledge who is going to see this program and the program we will record later and it will be rerun and God knows the ones who will watch it in the rerun and God knows who might see it on YouTube or who might be directed to it through Facebook or some other form of social media or preacher you don't really believe God knows and cares about all those things I absolutely do I believe that God knows right now this moment every person that will ever see or hear these words and I believe that he has a purpose in you being a part of this program today and I woke up this morning and I heard these words and it's found in the book of Saint John chapter 15 beginning in verse 16 ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring fruit or that you should go forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name he may give it you this is our Lord speaking to those who were gathered that day to hear the words of life that he would share and I can't get away from that phrase you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit I believe that's a verse that applies to your life absolutely I believe that may be one of the reasons why the Lord woke it woke me up this morning with it was to confirm our being together today Britax we're very very happy to have you here I'm very honored today to be here by the Shelley I believe you're one of those that the Lord has chosen you you may we may think sometimes we choose him but we know before we get that opportunity he's already chosen us absolutely would you tell us a little bit today about your background your life your family your growing up years and how you came to know the Lord I would certainly be delighted to do that just as a little background history I made my debut on the 23rd day of April 1970 that's a good mud and I happened to come into the world probably about eight weeks earlier than I was supposed to and I would learn later in life that the premature birth was the result of the traumatic experience that my mother was going through at the time I would discover that just prior to my birth my father would be condemned to prison for a hideous crime he had a sentence of 99 years with only one option for parole and this crime was so devastating and this event was so devastating to our family that my mother immediately turned to the dark side of life she became quickly addicted to drugs and alcohol and a sin a life of promiscuity because she was trying to hide and cover her pain right and oddly because of that she ended up having me prematurely and when I was when I was born she was really a psychological and an emotional wreck you might say sure and it would only be about five or six months later that my mother would decide that she could no longer really care for me properly and so she would take me and two other siblings one that was six years older than me one that was eight years older than me and put us in a local daycare center and at first it was protocol she would come pick us up every evening take us back the next day but after a few weeks my two older siblings ended up going to live with family members and she would leave me there not for days at a time but weeks at a time then months at a time and finally by the time I was three years old I had spent more time in that daycare center than I had spent with my own mother and I did not have any idea being so young exactly what all was going on but by the time I was three years old my mother was so addicted to drugs and alcohol that one night she was in a house that caught on fire had no idea that the house was on fire because she was so intoxicated and inebriated and by the time they rescued her from the flames of that burning home she had been burned on 75% of her body and she lay in a hospital for about three and a half months desperately trying to recover but on the fifth day of July 1973 she finally closed her eyes and her heartbeat the last time and when she left this world she left behind five children who would never live together as a family under a roof again she left behind a husband who was serving a life sentence behind bars for a hideous crime and no doubt this psychologically affected all of our family the older children much more than myself however it would it would be discovered that early on in my life learning these facts that uh I would struggle for many many years with the question of why of course just that one word while was a stumbling block for me it was a hurdle that I did not think I would ever be able to truly overcome I struggled with that one word why it was just it was there every waking moment of the day I was I was haunted you might say by that word wife every day of my life I wanted to know just exactly why has this happened to measure why has all of these in justices come my way what did I do to deserve this in my life and little did I know at that time that God had a plan that God had a plan for me I would discover later on in life that the Bible said the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord right and I would certainly realize years later that God Almighty was certainly directing my footsteps I was a I was a very troubled young man and by the time I was 12 years old I was truly sin bent and hail bound I was bitter I was full of unforgiveness I was filled with anger I was a I was stumbling from one day to the next over that one word why when eventually one day our family was invited to a Pentecostal church when you say our family who are you referring to now I'm referring to the to the lady that would raise me I was abandoned at the daycare center and she took me into her home and decided although she was 54 years old and had already raised all of her own children and had outlived two companions at 54 decided to take me in and make me her own do you do we know how she knew about you particularly in the daycare center what was she just aware of the circumstances in the situation or did she go looking for a child to adopt do we know how she well actually what happened her daughter was the owner of the daycare center all right and she helped manage the daycare center and so I was just left there for days at a time then weeks at a time then months at a time and she took me in and and wanted wanted to race me 54 years old and getting started over again with a small baby yes and she would later she would later tell her family that she felt like it was her destiny that she felt like it was her call in life was she a Christian woman she she was not a Christian but she was a moral one I think so she was a woman of great moral values and she would later say that she felt that it was her her destiny her call in life to provide me with a home and so it is at that time her her adult grown children would say mother why in the world would you want to assume the responsibility right for such a young child when it is a very good possibility that you might not even live long enough to raise this child exactly however she felt like that it was her destiny it was her call she said there's just something inside of me that keeps telling me that I must provide this child with a home that I must provide this child with guidance and direction and so it is that she took me in and she made me her own and so to go back to where you were so now you're a preteen going into your teenage years and you're very troubled I was a very troubled young man because she never kept from me the fact that my biological family had basically abandoned me you know they were they were good people but none of them wanted the responsibility of an infant and so she never kept that from me and because of that I always struggled with you know the heartache and pain and the disappointment of just literally being abandoned you know I struggled with those feelings of you know my family not truly wanting me and so it is that I was certainly struggling in many ways however we were invited to a Pentecostal church had no idea what a Pentecostal church was and I'll never forget the first service was was not all of that unique to me it wasn't earth-shaking by any means it just seemed to be an average ordinary church service like several other church services I had attended however the thing that did stand out to us the people were so kind that were so cordial they were so loving that uh we decided we wanted to go back and investigate even more and so it is on Sunday evening we did decide to go back to that same church and on Sunday evening the service was so much different than on Sunday morning the song service began and basically really the only way I could describe it the longer the song service continued the faster and the louder it seemed together until finally all of a sudden it was what I would call Pentecostal pandemonium brown people started jumping people started running people started crying people started laughing some people were shouting and I sat there on the edge of my Pew and I had never witnessed anything like this with my eyes in all of my life and even though it seemed to be chaos in the middle of what I thought was chaos there was a peace and a serenity that I had never experienced in all of my entire life threes and I'll never forget when that service was over walked outside climbed in the backseat of the old car we were driving and I'll never forget shutting the door to that car and saying in my and I have no idea what these people are I have no idea what they have but I do know one thing for sure if I'm ever going to be anything I'm going to be exactly what these people are there was something that happened in my heart that night for the first time in my life only 12 years old I finally realized there is a God in heaven and he is real and I decided at that moment that somehow if he would give me the opportunity I would find him well what an incredible story what an incredible story your life this is something that we could read in a good book right but this is God this was God's hand on your life and he lined up a precious woman yes who wasn't even a Christian at the time to play a role really it led her to the Lord I mean really didn't it I mean I see you and her absolutely you told me once about coming down the steps I think this might have been a little prior to the Pentecostal yes tell would you tell that I think especially because here we are on Christian television so I I think it would be a blessing for people to hear what what you saw one day when you came down the steps and your adopted mother was there yes only only a short time before we were invited to this Pentecostal church again we were not religious people we were not Christian people fact is from from the time I was born until I was about 11 years old I don't even recall ever attending a church service other than a funeral or a wedding mama we were just not church-going people missing my my adopted mother was very moral she was a kind woman she was a good woman but we were not we were not Christian people we were not we were not a church-going people however I'll never forget one Sunday morning I walked downstairs from my bedroom and it was on a Sunday morning and I'll never forget coming down those stairs as I turned the corner of the hall starting into the living room I saw something I'd never seen before my mother was sitting on the edge of her chair and she had her hand stretched out toward the television in front of her and there were tears streaming down her face and she was repeating a prayer with a minister who was on the television set and this was very unique to me I had never seen anything like this this was very uncommon fact is this would be only one of the very rare occasions that I would ever see my mother shed a tear she was a very stern a very no-nonsense kind of woman she was not a very nurturing woman although she had a very deep love for me and I would later understand that she had a very deep love for God and for the gospel but she just did not show that with very much outward emotion right however the unique thing was the very next Sunday I was laying in bed when she walked in the room she woke me up and she said get up I said what for she said we're going somewhere I said where are we going she said we're going to church and that very next Sunday she started carrying me to church on a regular basis of course we were not Pentecostal we didn't know anything about being spirit-filled we just basically started attending the closest church to the place where we lived and it would be only a short time later that someone would invite us to a Pentecostal church and it was just God's divine providence my my my it's uh it's hard to fathom how that God had a plan in all of the chaos in your life and yet God had a plan for you and for your adopted mother yes absolutely and Christian television played a role which I'm very very blessed to hear that what what well it was a conversion she accepted the Lord international praying a prayer and it gave her a desire to go and and find out more so that led to to a church that was non Pentecostal that eventually led to an invitation to a Pentecostal church where there was I think you described it as Pentecostal pandemonium is that how you say absolutely absolutely I've been in meetings like that I certainly have all right you you're you've attended your first Pentecostal Sunday you've been there in the morning the evening and you're closing the door of the vehicle and you're deciding that you've seen something real and you want more of it so what happened next we began to attend this this Pentecostal church on a regular basis and of course back in those days in the early 1980s sunday-school was a very big part of local churches and so it just so happened that God allowed me to be in the class with a man who was a very passionate servant of the Lord Jesus Christ and he was not your typical Sunday school teacher because whereas other Sunday School teachers were using printed material from Christian presses somewhere he said what I'm gonna do is we're just gonna open up the Word of God and we're gonna go from one chapter to the next verse five verse in a chronological order and we're just going to decide what does the Bible say and little did I know from one service to the next on Sunday morning that brief time in Sunday school there was a seed that he planted in my heart and that seed started coming to life and one Sunday morning as I walked out of Sunday school I just happened to sit down on the front row of the church and when the preacher gave the invitation on this particular morning all of a sudden I felt the presence of someone standing behind me it was so real that I could feel a breath on the back of my neck and as I turned to see who was standing behind me I realized there was no one standing there and all of a sudden there was something inside of me that would not allow me to stay on that Pew any moment any longer I jumped up off of that Pew and I fell across the altar in front of me a 12 year old boy who was sin bent and hail bound a young boy who had never prayed a prayer in his life a young boy that did not even know how to pray but as the tears streamed down my face all I could say was Jesus if you can save me please save every part of me and all of a sudden the guilty burden of sin began to lift away oh yeah and I got up on my feet and I turned and walked out of that building the world no longer looked the same to me the grass seemed to be greener the sky appeared to be bluer the birds singing sounded so much sweeter and all there was a joy and a peace in my heart that I had never experienced in all of my life omma a real conversion absolutely in the old time way absolutely because I remember hearing the old-timers testify of that kind of a conversion experience where where everything old is new and the things that you love you now Hayden the things you hated you now loved so your life was completely turned around absolutely it was it was so dramatic that the next day when I went to school I had about five or six very close friends and we stayed together most of the day during school and by mid afternoon my friends that were closest to me realized that there was something definitely wrong and they wanted to know exactly what it was and they began to ask me what's wrong what's happened to you and finally I looked at my friends and I said you may or may not be able to understand this but I went to church yesterday and I fell in love with Jesus Christ and I'm gonna serve Him as long as I live I'll never forget my friends did not approve of my conversion some of them laughed some of them made fun one of them looked at me and said I've tried that before too however it'll get old and it'll wear off and you'll eventually outgrow it and no doubt if you live long enough you'll go on to pursue other things in life however it's been three and a half decades since that original experience and that now the experience is so much more real and so much more lasting the songwriter said it gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by oh what a love between the Lord and I absolutely absolutely what about the question why how did you sort that out how did your conversion experience play what role did it play in helping you to come to that place to be able to deal with the why and anger and the hurt and rejection that you had known it would only be a few months later that I would be baptized in water and after I was baptized in water our church had a revival and the evangelists who came to our church at that time seemed to feel the inspiration of God to instruct the congregation that if they were not filled with the spirit they certainly needed to be seeking and desiring to be filled with the spirit that God had much more for them than what they currently had and as I listened to this evangelist there was a hunger that was birthed on the inside of me that I wanted everything that God had for me and I could look around and I realized that although I had truly repented and that my life had been changed such a way that people were taking notice of the changes that had taken place however inside of me I realized that I still desperately needed so much more oh yes so much more and so it was that I began to seek the Lord for this spirit in filling and God would give me a very real experience just prior to this spiritual in feeling and once I receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit of God gave me the utterance there was a glorious change that came in my life and all of a sudden I would begin to realize that God had strategically allowed these things to come my way in life because he was protecting the call that he had placed upon me from birth I would realize once I receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that the call of God was upon my life even before I was in my mother's womb absolutely so the value of the call of God in your life as God looked at that and he looked at what you would be and how you would work for him he was orchestrating things for your good even though someone standing off watching and looking maybe they would have pity and sympathy and feel sorry for you not knowing and you didn't know until you really received the baptism of the Holy Ghost that God was leading you and he was setting it up absolutely and I like to explain it like this that God allows us to see snapshots of our life along the way however at the end of life God takes all of the snapshots and he puts them together and they make one beautiful portrait and many times when we only see the snapshots we don't understand however when he finally puts all of the snapshots together and we behold the beautiful portrait we truly understand what the writer meant when he said that all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord who were the called according to his purpose I would finally begin to realize that all of the darkness and all of the negative moments in my life they were not from my demise they were not from my hurt they were not from my detriment but all of those things were truly for my good because each of those things were bringing me one step closer to the Father right was this an instantaneous realization when receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost or was it a process that you that you grew into being able to understand and accept the circumstances of your life it would it would be a process of grace absolutely it would it would come through a process of time one experience building upon another experience and I a course was was broken when I came to God I had no talent I had no skill I had no ability I had no resource I had no pedigree I had no one to promote me I just was broken in every way I was broken spiritually I was broken emotionally I was broken physically and I was a real liability as far as the world was concerned as far as the church was concerned I was a liability my adopted family would tell my mother over and over again why do you keep holding on to him why do you keep investing in him it's obvious he's destined be nothing it's obvious that he's not ever gonna be anything he's not ever going to amount to anything however there was something deep down inside of her that just would not allow her to let go somehow she knew that God had a plan and as God would begin to change me I would feel the call of God upon my life but I would wonder God why would you want to use someone like me there are so many people who have so much more skill they have so much more ability they have so much more talent they have so much more resource they have so much more knowledge why would you want to use someone like me and I would soon discover that what God looks for is not always ability but what God looks for is availability and what happened is at a very young age I would just simply make myself available to God I would hold the broken pieces of my life in my hand and unashamedly I would hand them to God and say this is all I've got it's broken and it doesn't look like much but I want to give it to you know and what I would discover is that oftentimes some of God's greatest and most valuable treasures are found in the scratch and dent department of life oh my oftentimes some of his rarest jewels come from the potter's field where other peoples have walked by and shook their head and said there's nothing valuable there mmmmmm it reminds me of the scripture that says they that are whole need not a physician it's the broken it's the needy that Jesus has come to make such a difference in their life rather Hix maybe someone's watching not maybe I I feel most definitely that there will be people watching you right now who have similar circumstances at least in the sense that things haven't been ideal for them and maybe they're right where you were at it at your teenage years you know why would God want me why would he want to use me I I would like for you to take a few moments and look into that camera and speak to that person what I would what I would like to say today is that perhaps you're listening to me right now and you feel broken perhaps you feel bruised maybe it is that you are halting in your step perhaps it is that you are struggling to put one foot in front of the other today and you wonder is there any possible way that I can overcome the circumstances that are surrounding my life perhaps it is that when you look at your own circumstances today it's a broken heart maybe it's a broken dream maybe it's a broken career maybe it's a broken relationship maybe it's a broken family that you're struggling with perhaps you're struggling with a broken body maybe it's affliction disease perhaps it's sickness or illness that you're struggling with today but I would challenge you today although it may look dark although the clouds may be looming in the distance and you may be wondering if the Sun will ever shine again I want to challenge you to just pick up the pieces rather than focus all of your attention on what you no longer have and that's where many of us are yeah many times we get trapped focusing our attention on what we no longer have but what I would ask you to do today is to stop looking at what you no longer have and start looking at what you have left just pick up what you have left and walk into the presence of God and just simply in a very humble way in a way with Noah with no fear and no trepidation just simply say God Here I am my life is broken my dreams are broken my home is broken my body is broken but I know today that somehow you specialize in broken things and I want to give you my broken heart I want to give you my broken dreams I want to give you my broken life and I'm asking you to make something beautiful out of it I can promise you today if you'll pick up the pieces and put them in the hand of God that God can take your misery and he can turn it into something that is masterful God can take all of your hurt and all of your pain and all of your brokenness and he can turn it into something beautiful amen because he's that kind of a God absolute that's who he is that's absolutely who he is and so how many years have you spent now in ministry I have been in ministry now for 33 years I would not truly advise a young aspiring preacher to do exactly what I did however when I realized that the call of God was upon my life one day in prayer I just decided that I would be bold that I would be audacious oh yes and so I got the local telephone book out I turned in the Yellow Pages to the church section and I called what I thought was every Pentecostal church in the Yellow Pages and every church that answered the phone I introduced myself and I asked for an opportunity to come to their church and to share my testimony and that day every single individual that answered the phone gave me the same answer no no every one of those individuals declined to give me the opportunity to come and share my testimony it was very disappointing sure it was a very devastating fact is I'll never forget the feelings of rejection that lost over and all of the pain of my past tried to come back worse and I remember laying down in the floor and I began to weep and I wept uncontrollably for a long period of time and when I finally got up out of the floor and began to wipe the tears away there was a part of me that wanted to quit there was a part of me that wanted to turn back they wanted to walk away however there was something else inside of me that just compelled me to open up the Bible and when I walked over picked up my Bible and I opened it up I looked down and my eyes the first thing I saw was the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel those words literally leaped off of the page and they became alive in my heart it was like those words kindled a fire inside of me that all of these years later is still burning so I decided that rather than wait on someone to give me the opportunity I would just go to the streets I would go to the parks I would go to the highways and the hedges as Jesus would say and I would begin to compel them to come in that his house might be fire my so how long was it until you had an open door in a church it would probably be about two years oh my about two years of preaching on the streets and witnessing and testifying in restaurants and Parks and own street corners at school in hospitals and nursing homes after church in parking lots sharing the Gospel message little did I know that there were some kids at school that had been watching me and they went to bat for me and they finally convinced their youth pastor to invite me to their youth service and I shared my testimony and just as I was finishing my testimony the pastor of the church walked in called about the last 10 minutes and the pastor came up and introduced themselves to me after service and gave me the opportunity to come back a few weeks later for a couple of nights and God would gloriously fill that place not only with his presence but with people and from that service from those three services doors would begin to open one door after another over and over and over again and I would quickly be thrust into full-time ministry traveling up and down the East Coast sharing the gospel with anyone who would listen you know I sense also that there will be people watching this program who have experienced the kind of discouraging setbacks that you did I mean I think you may be the only person and all the all the acquaintances and friendships that I've had in ministry through the years I think you're probably the only person I've ever heard of opening up the phone book and calling I loved the zeal behind that I do and I know your heart was just to find a place absolve him ever wherever - I think part of that was proving ground wasn't and I mean God was was allowing you to come to a place where it didn't matter if it was the pulpit or or on the street corner you just wanted to share the fire that was in you and there must be somebody watching that's had a lot of closed doors in their life knows they've heard a lot more knows what would you encourage of course preachers but but anyone who has a vision a burden to do something for the Lord and every time they start making a step it's it seems like there's doors being closed in their face what would you say to them I would I would challenge you that if you feel like that one door after another is being closed for you the the thing that sustained me through that period of time in my life was the word faithfulness that God was warming me to be faithless yes and as I was faithful to God what I discovered more importantly was that God was faithful to me yes a man and what I realized was that God was preparing me he was preparing me and he was allowing me to understand that I had been brought into the kingdom for such a time as this in those in those early moments of my life and ministry and conversion I probably wasn't as ready as I felt like I was but God certainly had a plan he wanted me to be faithful right and he wanted me to understand that although I did not think so he had his eye upon me and I would like to say to you today that if you feel like you have experienced a lot of disappointing setbacks in your life and maybe perhaps you feel all alone remember that God does not have to autograph every single page of your life to be a part of it sometimes God does his greatest work in your life and mind when he is behind the scene and we can't see him sometimes we can't feel him sometimes we can't sense him sometimes we wonder if he even realizes that we still exist right amen oftentimes it's in those moments that God is busy behind the scene and he is working on our behalf amen so be faithful your advice is to be faithful because it teaches us about the faithfulness of God absol absolutely if we will be faithful to God God will certainly be faithful to us and one of the things that we'll understand is that God is always right on time always God's time schedule and our time schedule does not always coincide that the fact of the matter is oftentimes we want to get in a hurry and we want everything to be as instant and as quick as possible right however God oftentimes a seems to kind of wait he but really the fact of the matter is that he's just simply allowing us to know that his time clock in our time clock is not always the same but he is always right on time he is never a moment too early he's never a moment too late he's always right on time absolutely I know that at some point in your life your ministry developed into a tent ministry were you pastoring first before you were doing the evangelistic work or how did that how did that come about in order did you go immediately to the tenants as my ministry began to unfold and I began to feel the call of God and accept the call of God and move toward ministry God allowed some very special men with some very powerful ministries and gifts to come into my life and those men had tent ministries and so naturally because of the impact that they had upon my life there was a great love that quickly developed in my heart for the tent ministry and I began to see the opportunity that people could be reached in that venue and so it is that as a young man I didn't have any idea how I would ever be in the tent ministry but God allowed some people to invest in my life a man gave me a telephone call and said would you come and preach for me a couple of nights I quickly agreed because back in those days I wanted to walk through every door that God opened regardless of where it was at big or small and before the conversation was over he said now brother Hicks I want you'd understand that we don't have any money we are struggling ourselves we're a whole mission Church we only have a handful of people he said however I can promise if you'll come we'll provide you with a place to stay and we'll provide you with plenty of food to eat and I was just as happy as a jaybird on a chocolate cake I mean to tell you I was excited about the door being opened and so I was counting down the days and I finally made my way to that small little home mission church in Kentucky Friday night Saturday night to services on Sunday and god-glory visited us in those services and on Sunday evening there was some people who came to the service that invited me to their home after service and for some fellowship and so it was that I went to their home and we had fellowship and when the fellowship was coming to a close I was getting ready to drive all night back to North Carolina to prepare for some more services in the future and they said brother Hicks we would like to give this to you and we hope that it'll be a blessing to you it was in a brown sack and I just took the sack and thank them for it got in my car started down the highway I'll never forget I reached Knoxville Tennessee it must have been about 3 o'clock in the morning I pulled over went into a and an all-night Waffle House and refreshed myself got a cup of coffee because in my mind I thought they had given me some food for the road I went back outside and I had the coffee in my hand I reached over and I picked up the bag that I had just sat in the seat beside me and when I opened up the bag how shocked I was because it was not sandwich ism it was eight thousand dollars in $20 bills my and I was absolutely astounded because I had never seen $8,000 in my life and I knew the very moment that I saw that $8,000 that God wanted me to buy a tent mine I took that money and I purchased my very first tent and God blessed in such a miraculous way my water provision what a faithful God to meet the need very faithful so it wasn't sandwiches not at all not at all we have about five minutes left and I'd like for you to spend that time praying yes I really would because I know there are people who watch this program who have needs and I know that in the spirit but I also know that in the natural because you're faithful to call we have a prayer line and many of you have called and some of you have spoken with staff members others of you have called after our hours and left messages and we've carried those needs to the body here and we have prayed and we're already hearing testimonies of how God is answering prayer we serve a prayer answering God and let me say if you've not taken the opportunity to send in your prayer request you can be assured that we will take them before the Lord will join our faith with your faith and believe God to meet your needs he's still a healer he's still a savior he is still a deliverer and he cares about our needs big and small brother Hicks just say a word or two about God's faithfulness to answer prayer and then pray pray for the needs of all of the people who will see this program whatever they are I would certainly want to remind you today that the beautiful thing about prayer is that not only does God hear us when we pray but God stands ready and willing to answer us man when we pray that is why he said ask and you shall receive seek and you shall find knock and the door shall be opened unto you he would later say what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them yes and you shall have them I want you to know today that there's nothing too big yes there's nothing too great there's nothing too impossible for this mighty God that we serve he has more answers today than you have questions he has more miracles today than you have needs of he has more healing than you have sickness he has more provision today yes well then you have won't - now would challenge you
