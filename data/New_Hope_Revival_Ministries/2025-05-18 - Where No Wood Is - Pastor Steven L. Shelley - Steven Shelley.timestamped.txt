[30:00] hearts. Hear our spirit
[30:06] sing. A song of praise that

[30:17] [Applause]
[30:19] redeemed. And we will use the words we
[30:24] know to tell you what an awesome God you
[30:32] are. But when words are not
[30:35] enough to tell you of our love, Lord,
[30:40] listen to our
[30:45] heart. If words could fall, I
[30:49] [Music]
[30:52] gra from these lips of mine.
[30:59] And if I had a thousand
[31:04] years, Lord, I would still run out of
[31:08] time.
[31:12] So if you listen to our
[31:18] heart, Lord, every beat will
[31:21] [Music]
[31:24] say, "Oh, thank you for the

[31:57] flows to those you have redeemed.
[32:05] And we will use the words we know just
[32:09] to tell you what an awesome God that you
[32:17] are. But when words are not enough to
[32:21] tell you of our love. Oh, listen to our
[32:27] hearts.
[32:28] It's my favorite verse.
[32:31] If birds could fall, I
[32:37] gra from these lips of
[32:41] [Music]
[32:43] mine. And if I had a thousand
[32:49] years, oh, I would still run out of
[32:53] time.
[32:57] So if you listen to our
[33:03] heart, Lord, every beat will

[33:13] life. Thank you for this truth and thank

[43:33] Amen.
[43:36] Amen.
[43:38] Who has an unspoken prayer request just
[43:39] by the uplifting of the hand? There's
[43:41] needs all over this room. The Lord knows
[43:42] every single one of them.
[43:45] Sister Jeffy's sister was taken to the
[43:48] hospital in the night and the MRI showed
[43:50] bleeding on the brain. They're doing
[43:52] surgery on Robin today. Let's pray for
[43:54] her. Let's pray God's gracious grace to
[43:57] be upon her. I had Jessica down that we
[44:00] would remember her and her family to the
[44:02] Lord. And she's here this morning. We're
[44:04] blessed about that. Sister Trish is
[44:07] home. She's been really sick this week
[44:09] with bronchitis. And Joseph is not
[44:11] feeling well. So, we want to lift them
[44:13] up to the Lord. The Miller kids are
[44:15] traveling this weekend. We want to pray
[44:17] for their safety as they go. Brother
[44:19] Daniel reached out to tell us that he
[44:21] had two unspoken requests and we want to
[44:24] believe that God will undertake in every
[44:26] one of those needs. And then there was
[44:29] another tragedy this week in the Wallace
[44:31] family.
[44:33] You all will remember a few years ago
[44:35] Bruce Wallace's son uh passed away in a
[44:38] plane, small plane crash with three
[44:40] other young believers. And this week,
[44:43] the son of Vern, named after his dad,
[44:46] his son Dylan, uh lost his life in a
[44:49] param motor accident, param motor crash,
[44:53] which is it's a paraglide with a with a
[44:55] motor on it. They wouldn't have known
[44:58] exactly what had happened except for the
[45:00] fact that a forest fire showed up on the
[45:02] radar. They went in to put out the small
[45:04] fire contained but but growing and found
[45:08] the body. So this family of course is
[45:10] devastated and would certainly we would
[45:13] want to we love the whole family. I know
[45:15] the the the great the grandparents and
[45:18] have known them for for over 30 years.
[45:21] They came out of latter rain. Would you
[45:23] pray that God will move for that entire
[45:26] family? Bless them. Help them. Comfort
[45:28] them. Most of all, some of them have
[45:30] have strayed from the Lord. Pray that
[45:32] God will draw them back to the to the
[45:35] middle of the road of truth.
[45:39] Just sing this as we go to prayer.
[45:44] Thank you, Jesus.
[45:47] Pray for brother. He's preaching
[45:49] already. May be coming to an end by now,
[45:51] but he's he's preaching for his
[45:56] dad. Peace of God, cover
[46:03] me and cover
[46:07] me and cover me.
[46:14] Peace of God, cover
[46:19] me through the
[46:23] storm. And cover

[47:37] again. Peace of God, cover
[47:44] me. Cover
[47:48] me. Cover me.
[47:54] Peace of God, cover me
[48:01] through the storm.
[48:04] and cover
[48:08] me. And only in you I am safe.

[48:30] peace. Don't hurt me.

[48:42] hurting. Cover me when I'm not
[48:46] strong. Cover me when I am going through
[48:51] the
[48:54] storm. Cover me when it all seems
[48:58] hopeless. Cover me when my faith is
[49:01] gone.
[49:02] Let the peace that passes all I
[49:09] understand. Cover
[49:12] me. Cover me. Let's sing the chorus
[49:16] again. Brother R.J., would you
[49:18] [Music]
[49:19] come? God, cover
[49:24] me. Cover
[49:28] me. Cover
[49:33] me. Peace of God, cover
[49:39] me through the storm.
[49:43] [Music]
[49:45] cover
[49:48] me. And only in you I am safe.
[49:57] And only in you I'm secure.
[50:04] And only in you I find peace.
[50:10] Oh
[50:11] cover
[50:14] me.
[50:15] Cover
[50:18] me. Cover me when I am
[50:22] hurting. Cover me when I'm not
[50:25] strong. Cover me when I am going through
[50:30] the
[50:33] storm. Cover me when all seems hopeless.
[50:38] Cover me when my faith is gone. And let
[50:42] the priest that passes all I
[50:48] understand cover.
[50:52] [Music]
[50:57] Oh Yeshua,
[51:00] how thankful we are, Lord, that you
[51:04] do. We feel you today,
[51:07] Lord. Your presence that that you're
[51:10] alive and that you're active and that
[51:14] you care, oh God. Yes. I thank you,
[51:20] Lord, that you feel our need and our
[51:23] burden and you respond to it. That is
[51:26] the truth.
[51:28] I thank you, Lord, that we're not
[51:31] without hope. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[51:38] Yes, we thank you Lord for your peace.
[51:45] I I think of the scripture, I will keep
[51:47] in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[51:51] me.
[51:53] Hallelujah.
[51:55] And we have the assurance, Lord,
[51:59] in every circumstance
[52:01] that we might
[52:03] face, we have everything that we need in
[52:07] Christ.
[52:09] And it's not a Christ that we can't
[52:12] access. That's right. It's not a Christ
[52:14] behind a veil. No, sir.
[52:17] But you carried your own blood into
[52:21] heaven and you made a way, oh God, that
[52:24] each of us here today can access the
[52:28] throne of God. Yes, sir. And so we come
[52:31] to you, Father,
[52:33] free. Glory to Jesus. Fully
[52:38] of hope and thankfulness, oh God,
[52:43] that you're at work in our lives.
[52:50] We worship you, Aba.
[52:56] There's no reason to despair. No, sir.
[53:01] What does David say? He says, "Why art
[53:04] thou disqued within me? Hope thou in
[53:07] God.
[53:10] Hope thou in God." Yes.
[53:14] And so we pray, Father, for every need
[53:17] and every care and every burden. And we
[53:21] lay it at your feet today, Lord. And we
[53:23] ask that you would come and that you
[53:25] would manifest
[53:28] yourself that you would reveal yourself
[53:30] to us, oh God.
[53:33] And that you would bring your will to
[53:35] pass in our lives.
[53:37] Yes. Lord, I pray for every loved one
[53:41] that's in need, those that have lost
[53:43] loved ones, those that are grieving.
[53:46] Yes. Yes. I ask that you would draw near
[53:48] unto them, Lord. Comfort you are, Lord.
[53:52] Fill them with your peace. Renew their
[53:55] vision. Lord,
[53:57] let them see your sovereignty, your
[54:00] goodness, your mercy, oh God.
[54:06] Lord, we speak healing over everybody
[54:08] today.
[54:11] I thank you, Lord, that healing is part
[54:14] of the atonement.
[54:16] And so we claim it today over every
[54:20] body, over ourselves. We speak it in the
[54:23] name of Yeshua, the Messiah.
[54:26] Lord, we place your blood against every
[54:29] lie. Anything, Lord, in the natural that
[54:32] would be contrary to your word, we place
[54:36] your blood, your blood speaks,
[54:39] Lord, healing and redemption.
[54:42] [Music]
[54:45] And we love you today, Lord. We just
[54:47] respond to you.
[54:50] We respond to your presence, Lord,
[54:54] in this place. May you feel welcome.
[54:58] May you feel free to move and to have
[55:01] your will and your way. Lord, we lay
[55:04] every agenda at your feet. Oh God, we
[55:08] just want you to be
[55:11] revealed for you to transform our lives,
[55:14] Lord.
[55:18] We bless you today, oh God. Use this
[55:22] service for your purposes. In the name
[55:25] of Yeshua, the Messiah, we pray. Amen.
[55:35] [Applause]
[55:36] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[55:39] You may be seated today. Thank you,
[55:41] Jesus.
[55:43] Amen. IAS and Jonathan, would y'all mind
[55:45] coming and help me with the offering
[55:47] today? Thank you, Lord. Let's go. Go to
[55:49] the people today as Kade sings for us.
[55:52] Thank you. Thank you, Jesus.
[56:00] [Music]
[56:15] I cried,
[56:18] Lord, have you forgotten me?
[56:23] It seems
[56:25] lately you're not
[56:29] around. And all the
[56:33] tears and all my
[56:37] fears I know you'd see them if you look
[56:43] [Music]
[56:45] down. But in the
[56:49] darkness I still hear you.
[56:54] So
[56:55] softly say these
[56:59] words. I'm just working on your
[57:03] testimony. Don't you give on
[57:07] me. I'm moving in
[57:10] ways that you cannot see.
[57:15] I know right now it's
[57:18] lonely and the darkness weighs on you,
[57:23] but just have
[57:25] faith and trust.
[57:29] Believe I'm just working on your
[57:38] testimony. If you're
[57:41] alone and feel you cannot
[57:45] win and you're
[57:48] tired of always feeling
[57:53] down, all your
[57:56] tears and all your
[58:00] fears, just know he sees them as he
[58:05] looks down.
[58:08] And in the
[58:11] darkness and all you're
[58:15] hurting, just
[58:17] remember
[58:19] these
[58:21] words. He's just working on your
[58:25] testimony and don't give up on him. He's
[58:30] moving in
[58:32] ways that we cannot see.
[58:37] I know right now it's
[58:39] lonely and the darkness weighs on
[58:44] you. Just have
[58:46] faith. Oh, trust and
[58:50] believe. He's just working on your
[58:53] testimony.
[58:59] [Music]
[59:00] and he sees the tears you
[59:03] cry. Even when you feel
[59:07] alone, he listens to your prayers and
[59:11] moves. Even when you think he
[59:18] won't. He's just working on your
[59:22] testimony. Don't give up on me. He's
[59:27] moving in
[59:29] ways that we cannot
[59:32] see. I know right now it's
[59:36] lonely and the darkness weighs on you.
[59:41] But just have
[59:43] faith. Oh, trust and
[59:47] believe. I'm just working on your
[59:50] testimony.
[59:51] [Music]
[59:55] I'm just working on your testimony.
[1:00:04] [Music]
[1:00:10] Amen.
[1:00:11] Hallelujah. I'm glad he's still working
[1:00:13] on my testimony today. Amen.
[1:00:18] Amen. Amen. Let's all stand and get
[1:00:19] ready to go to the word.
[1:00:24] [Music]
[1:00:33] I've seen a
[1:00:35] vision harsh and
[1:00:39] sweet. The one who gave all he had for
[1:00:45] me.
[1:00:48] And I've seen the
[1:00:50] passion of his
[1:00:54] death and the
[1:00:56] forgiveness in his final
[1:01:01] breath. Now I could
[1:01:04] never be the
[1:01:08] same. My heart has been
[1:01:13] forever changed.
[1:01:16] I've got to live and love and give
[1:01:23] because he
[1:01:30] gave. I'm giving my
[1:01:34] life
[1:01:38] away. Laying it down on the
[1:01:43] altar. And now I'm giving my life
[1:01:53] away. The very least I can
[1:01:58] offer is my all.
[1:02:04] [Music]
[1:02:06] So here I
[1:02:08] stand
[1:02:10] today giving my
[1:02:13] life away.
[1:02:15] [Music]
[1:02:20] No earthly price could be too
[1:02:26] great. And no
[1:02:29] sacrifice too much to
[1:02:33] make. And no way of
[1:02:37] measuring the
[1:02:40] cost next to the blood of
[1:02:45] Calary's cross.
[1:02:48] So if I live, I live for
[1:02:54] him. Or if I die, I count it
[1:03:01] gain. My life is not my own, but his
[1:03:08] from this day on.
[1:03:14] [Music]
[1:03:16] Now I'm giving my life
[1:03:24] away. Laying it down on the
[1:03:29] altar. Now I'm giving my
[1:03:34] life away.
[1:03:36] Oh yes.
[1:03:39] The very least I can
[1:03:43] offer is my all.
[1:03:50] Yes. So here I
[1:03:53] stand
[1:03:55] today just giving my life away. Amen.
[1:04:01] That's good. Praise the Lord. Sing it
[1:04:04] again. Now I'm giving my
[1:04:09] life away.
[1:04:14] Laying it down on the altar.
[1:04:19] And now I'm giving my life away.
[1:04:26] The very least,
[1:04:28] the very least I can
[1:04:33] offer is my all. My all.
[1:04:38] I want you to have my all, Jesus. So
[1:04:41] here I
[1:04:42] stand
[1:04:45] today giving my
[1:04:48] life away.
[1:04:51] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:04:55] So here I stand today
[1:04:58] giving my life away.
[1:05:02] Why don't you just lift your hands and
[1:05:04] make that commitment to the Lord? Here I
[1:05:06] am, Lord. Use me. Here I am, Lord. Have
[1:05:12] your way in
[1:05:13] me. Here I am, Lord. I lay my
[1:05:18] ambitions, my agendas, my goals, even my
[1:05:21] dreams. I lay them on the altar, Lord,
[1:05:25] for more than anything else in all the
[1:05:27] world, I want your sovereign will in my
[1:05:30] life. And I want you to be able to use
[1:05:33] me
[1:05:34] somehow, some way for your
[1:05:37] glory. Lord, we don't want to hold back
[1:05:39] any part of who we
[1:05:41] are, any part of our heart.
[1:05:44] We want you to have it
[1:05:47] all to your
[1:05:49] glory, to your honor, to your
[1:05:53] praise. Can you say amen? Would you give
[1:05:56] him another hand clap of
[1:05:58] praise? Praise
[1:06:01] God.
[1:06:06] Hallelujah. You may be seated today.
[1:06:08] It's that's been one of the best hours
[1:06:11] I've spent in a long time. And I'm very
[1:06:14] blessed today. The presence of the Lord
[1:06:17] just swirling around among us. And we
[1:06:20] need him. I don't know about you, but
[1:06:22] I'm going to need him today. I'll need
[1:06:24] him again tomorrow. Is that how you
[1:06:27] feel?
[1:06:28] We want to give God praise. He's been
[1:06:30] with us this week. We are very thankful
[1:06:33] to to have Jessica with us and we feel
[1:06:38] really honored to have been able to go
[1:06:41] and attend the memorial service for her
[1:06:44] husband because I'd only met him one
[1:06:47] time. But we left that place feeling
[1:06:50] like we knew him. And I've told
[1:06:53] everybody, Jessica, I've told everybody
[1:06:55] I'm I could talk
[1:06:57] to how touched we were. his cousin gave
[1:07:02] the sermon and it was a beautiful
[1:07:06] testimony. I appreciated it so much. You
[1:07:08] know what I appreciated the most? The
[1:07:10] simple gospel that was presented. Wasn't
[1:07:13] preachy but it was simple and it was
[1:07:17] beautiful.
[1:07:18] The preacher said, the pastor of the
[1:07:20] church there who was the cousin, he
[1:07:22] said, "You can have big dreams, big
[1:07:25] goals, big
[1:07:27] talents, but if you don't recognize that
[1:07:29] you have a big God and you've not given
[1:07:32] him your all, none of the rest of that
[1:07:35] means anything." Now, can you say amen
[1:07:37] to that? I
[1:07:39] did. I did. I couldn't help myself. I
[1:07:43] had to say amen because it's a truth
[1:07:45] that the whole world needs to hear.
[1:07:47] Ain't that right? And then we were so
[1:07:50] blessed, Sister Sharon, so privileged to
[1:07:53] be able to share a very special moment
[1:07:55] in your life. Uh uh as on Thursday of
[1:07:59] this week, Sister Sharon's daughter,
[1:08:01] Heather, who lives in Arizona, who I had
[1:08:04] never met before, I got to meet her and
[1:08:07] talk to her about uh what baptism is
[1:08:11] about because the Lord had laid on her
[1:08:12] heart that she should make that
[1:08:14] commitment. And uh not only that, it was
[1:08:17] her desire for me to do it, which was an
[1:08:19] honor. And I was able to to gather with
[1:08:22] a few of members of their family and
[1:08:24] sister Flo who's a part of their family
[1:08:26] too. And Sister Sharon's mother was even
[1:08:29] there. She's the oldest person that I've
[1:08:32] ever baptized. And she was the first
[1:08:35] person that Benjamin ever helped me
[1:08:38] baptize. And then he was able to help me
[1:08:41] baptize Sister Sharon's daughter. So,
[1:08:43] three
[1:08:44] generations. And God moved. He moved.
[1:08:47] his presence was real and it was
[1:08:49] sovereign and she's gone back to Arizona
[1:08:52] different because that's what Jesus
[1:08:55] does. He makes a difference in our
[1:08:57] lives. So, it's been a busy week because
[1:09:01] we also got to welcome a brand new
[1:09:05] little
[1:09:07] newopian into this world. Vivian Joe
[1:09:12] Ellsworth. That's J, right?
[1:09:16] Not J O E J O Vivian Joe Ellsworth who
[1:09:20] is in church this morning five days old
[1:09:24] in the presence of the Lord already. She
[1:09:26] came into this world in the presence of
[1:09:29] the Lord and um we're just so thankful.
[1:09:33] We're thankful God moved again once
[1:09:36] again. He performed a miracle and we're
[1:09:39] just thankful. Amen. That's right. He's
[1:09:42] worthy.
[1:09:48] Like I've said before, it's not my story
[1:09:50] to tell, but I will tell you this. It
[1:09:53] could have turned out a whole lot
[1:09:54] differently than it did. But there's two
[1:09:57] words that make such a big difference in
[1:09:58] all of our lives, but God. Just in the
[1:10:02] nick of time, he moves. And um we're
[1:10:06] we're thankful for that. And we've
[1:10:08] already been able to spend time with
[1:10:09] her. and uh she's already slept on Pap's
[1:10:13] chest and there's just something pretty
[1:10:16] special about that for me and I
[1:10:18] appreciate the Lord blessing uh that
[1:10:22] little family.
[1:10:23] I don't know if everyone knows that they
[1:10:26] they lost a baby in the in in between
[1:10:28] and had gone all these many years
[1:10:31] without uh without one and the miracle
[1:10:35] came and and we're thankful and we won't
[1:10:39] put him on the spot and ask him if this
[1:10:41] is the caboose. We'll leave that up to
[1:10:43] the Lord. and and uh the first week of
[1:10:46] the first week of life, first few weeks
[1:10:48] of life, you you really can't get a good
[1:10:51] answer if you ask because uh the sleep
[1:10:54] deprivation and all that, you know, is
[1:10:56] still working on them and and um they
[1:10:59] might not give the best of the answers
[1:11:00] that they would give. Today is brother
[1:11:03] Shaw's
[1:11:05] birthday. He's the oldest man in our
[1:11:08] church.
[1:11:12] I think that's a blessing to
[1:11:19] be. It's a blessing to be 66. Is that
[1:11:23] right? To be 66 and be the oldest man.
[1:11:28] He gets he gets the the I don't know if
[1:11:31] he feels like it's an honor or not, but
[1:11:33] he gets to wear the honor because the
[1:11:36] Lord took our our other senior brothers
[1:11:38] home and they lived a good long life and
[1:11:42] we believe that brother Shaw will. He's
[1:11:45] very liable to be alive in the rapture.
[1:11:47] I I wouldn't be surprised if he's not
[1:11:49] kicking around at rapture time, but we
[1:11:52] want to wish him a very happy birthday
[1:11:55] today. Amen. been with us a long
[1:11:58] [Music]
[1:12:00] time. Tomorrow is is Deborah Botway's
[1:12:04] birthday of faithful streaming family.
[1:12:07] We love them in Alberta. May God bless
[1:12:10] her. And it's also uh Brother Brandham's
[1:12:13] baby boy's Joseph's uh birthday on the
[1:12:17] 19th. We always ask that you would pray
[1:12:19] for them, pray for the family. They
[1:12:21] certainly need our prayers. And Tuesday
[1:12:24] the 20th is brother Robert and sister
[1:12:27] Teresa's wedding anniversary. She's not
[1:12:30] in here to help you out. How many is
[1:12:35] this? Maybe
[1:12:38] 19. Could be 18 behind. Could be 19
[1:12:42] behind. It's one or the
[1:12:45] other. Time flies when you're having
[1:12:48] fun.
[1:12:50] It's also a very special day in our
[1:12:52] family because Tuesday the 20th is
[1:12:55] Elelliana Jane's first birthday. She's
[1:12:58] been with us a year. It's hard to
[1:13:01] believe at times. Seems like we've
[1:13:03] always had her around and then it seems
[1:13:06] like that she just came, but you know
[1:13:08] how that goes as parents and
[1:13:10] grandparents. So, we're looking forward
[1:13:12] to celebrating with her. On Wednesday is
[1:13:14] brother Billy and sister Laurel's
[1:13:16] wedding anniversary and uh there's
[1:13:19] that's a bunch of them because you all
[1:13:21] were born married in 94. Is that right?
[1:13:24] And so this is what 31 years. We give
[1:13:28] God the glory for that. Amen.
[1:13:36] Thursday the 22nd is Sister Girt's
[1:13:39] birthday and uh she will be
[1:13:42] 89. And uh would you pray for her? I
[1:13:45] hope you do. I pray for her every day.
[1:13:47] In fact, multiple times a day. would you
[1:13:50] continue to pray for her uh that God
[1:13:53] would strengthen her and help her and
[1:13:56] also of course sister Terry uh her
[1:13:59] strength and the whole family uh because
[1:14:02] they're taking turns coming to the
[1:14:04] service and and being with with Sister
[1:14:06] Gert and she's lived a very long life
[1:14:09] and she has a big family and there's a
[1:14:11] big inheritance a big uh legacy that uh
[1:14:15] that's behind her and we pray for the
[1:14:16] whole family of course we do and then
[1:14:19] Friday is sister Laurel's birthday and
[1:14:21] I'm not dare going there except to say
[1:14:24] happy birthday sister Laurel. So happy
[1:14:28] to celebrate your
[1:14:31] birthday. And then uh on Saturday is
[1:14:34] brother Bernie Hammermeister's birthday.
[1:14:37] Long time streamer. I don't know if he's
[1:14:40] um if he's catching all the archives or
[1:14:43] not, but uh we will certainly want to
[1:14:47] wish him a happy birthday. And I also
[1:14:48] noticed on the calendar that it was
[1:14:52] would have been brother Cleveland's
[1:14:53] birthday. I don't believe they have them
[1:14:55] in heaven, but here on the earth, if he
[1:14:58] would have stayed here, I'm glad he
[1:14:59] didn't have to. He would have been
[1:15:01] 103. He means a whole lot to me. He's
[1:15:04] the one who who handed me the first
[1:15:06] tapes that I ever heard. I wouldn't be
[1:15:10] uh exaggerating to tell you they changed
[1:15:12] my life, and I always think of him and
[1:15:15] honor him. Uh, David,
[1:15:18] um, tell us what what we ought to know
[1:15:21] about the valley. You were telling me
[1:15:24] about the valley. It won't take you
[1:15:27] long. Just tell tell what you were
[1:15:29] telling me about the
[1:15:31] valley. Not the valley. Not up sister
[1:15:34] Sister Cindy's Valley up the road.
[1:15:39] I I asked brother Shel to sing a song
[1:15:41] and we were just talking about the
[1:15:43] meaning of the valley and it's you know
[1:15:45] it's sometimes hard and but sometimes
[1:15:47] the valley can be beautiful and that's
[1:15:50] where the Lord restores you. Amen. You
[1:15:52] know and I mean it's just this song has
[1:15:56] been speaking to me a lot and I just
[1:15:58] really been thinking about it lately.
[1:16:00] It's not always the enemy. That's that's
[1:16:03] what he said to me. It's not always the
[1:16:05] enemy that puts us there in the valley.
[1:16:09] Thomas knew that, didn't he? He said,
[1:16:12] "It's in the valley he restoereth my
[1:16:15] soul." I haven't practiced either, and
[1:16:18] I'm not sure I'll be able to pull it off
[1:16:20] like Olivia and Benjamin did without
[1:16:23] practice, but we're going to try. For
[1:16:26] David and for me, I told him I'd been
[1:16:29] there a little bit uh for a few days.
[1:16:32] It's not a bad place to be. Doesn't feel
[1:16:34] as exciting as the
[1:16:37] mountain. When I'm
[1:16:39] low in
[1:16:42] spirit, I cry, "Lord,
[1:16:45] lift me up.
[1:16:49] I want
[1:16:50] to go
[1:16:53] higher with
[1:16:58] thee, but the Lord
[1:17:01] knows I can't live on the
[1:17:06] mountain. Woo!
[1:17:09] So he picked
[1:17:11] out a
[1:17:14] valley for me.
[1:17:20] And then he leads
[1:17:22] me
[1:17:25] beside still
[1:17:31] waters
[1:17:32] somewhere in the
[1:17:35] valley
[1:17:39] below. Then he draws me
[1:17:45] aside to be tested.
[1:17:49] tested and
[1:17:50] tried. Oh, but in the
[1:17:53] valley he
[1:17:56] restoreth my
[1:17:59] [Music]
[1:18:01] soul. Well, it's
[1:18:04] dark as a
[1:18:06] dungeon and the sun
[1:18:10] som shines.
[1:18:13] And I
[1:18:15] question, Lord, why must this
[1:18:21] [Music]
[1:18:22] be? Oh, then he tells
[1:18:25] me there's strength in my
[1:18:32] sorrow. And there's
[1:18:36] victory in
[1:18:38] trials for me. I want to hear you sing
[1:18:42] it with me if you would. So he leads
[1:18:46] me
[1:18:49] beside still
[1:18:52] waters. Doesn't he do
[1:18:55] it
[1:18:57] somewhere in the
[1:18:59] valley below?
[1:19:05] Jesus draws me
[1:19:09] aside to be
[1:19:12] tested, tested and tried. But it's in
[1:19:17] the
[1:19:17] valley he
[1:19:20] restoreth my soul. Give me verse one
[1:19:24] again.
[1:19:26] When I'm
[1:19:28] low in
[1:19:30] spirit, I cry, Lord,
[1:19:34] lift me
[1:19:36] up. I want to go
[1:19:41] higher with
[1:19:45] [Music]
[1:19:46] thee. But the Lord knows that I can't
[1:19:51] live on a mountain.
[1:19:57] So he picked out a
[1:20:02] valley for me. That sounds like love to
[1:20:06] me, doesn't it, you? And then he leads
[1:20:10] me
[1:20:13] beside still
[1:20:16] waters. Glory.
[1:20:20] somewhere in the
[1:20:23] valley
[1:20:27] below. Then he draws me
[1:20:33] aside to be
[1:20:36] tested, tested and
[1:20:39] tried. But in the
[1:20:41] valley he
[1:20:44] restoreth my soul. I don't know when
[1:20:48] I'll ever sing it again. So I'll do this
[1:20:50] verse again. It's
[1:20:52] dark as a
[1:20:54] [Music]
[1:20:55] dungeon and the sun som
[1:21:00] shines. And I
[1:21:03] question, Lord, why must this be?
[1:21:12] Oh, but he tells me there is strength in
[1:21:18] my
[1:21:21] sorrow and there's
[1:21:24] victory in
[1:21:27] trials for me. Let's stand and sing it
[1:21:31] before we go to the word. So he leads
[1:21:35] me
[1:21:38] beside still
[1:21:44] waters
[1:21:46] somewhere in the
[1:21:49] valley
[1:21:52] below. Then he draws me aside. Thank you
[1:21:59] papa to be
[1:22:01] tested. Tested and tried. But in the
[1:22:07] valley he
[1:22:09] restoreth my
[1:22:13] soul.
[1:22:15] He draws
[1:22:18] me
[1:22:20] aside to be
[1:22:23] tested. Tested and tried.
[1:22:27] But it's in the
[1:22:30] valley. He
[1:22:33] restoreth my
[1:22:36] [Music]
[1:22:41] soul. Do you believe that?
[1:22:44] [Applause]
[1:22:58] Sometimes we have to have them. And he
[1:23:01] restores us, breathes on us, anoints our
[1:23:03] head with oil. Come on. Amen. Gives us
[1:23:08] green pa pastures. Uh the green pastures
[1:23:12] where the sheep are grazing. They're not
[1:23:14] on the top of the mountain. They're down
[1:23:17] in the valley. I love this. I love the
[1:23:20] 23rd Psalm. It's not just children's
[1:23:23] play. It's meaty, isn't it? The Lord is
[1:23:27] my shepherd.
[1:23:30] What's the next phrase?
[1:23:32] I shall not
[1:23:35] want. How will you not want? Because the
[1:23:38] Lord is your shepherd. You just keep
[1:23:41] going back to the first phrase all the
[1:23:42] way through it. Because the Lord is my
[1:23:44] shepherd, he'll restore my soul even in
[1:23:47] the valley. That is the goodness of God.
[1:23:50] Amen. Amen. Uh we want to thank the Lord
[1:23:53] for these musicians. They've just done
[1:23:56] an outstanding
[1:24:02] job. Amen. Uh let's go this morning to
[1:24:06] the word of God. I want us to
[1:24:10] turn. If you have your Bible, it's
[1:24:13] always good to read it for yourself.
[1:24:23] I've got to find where I want to
[1:24:33] go. Proverbs chapter
[1:24:38] 26 and verse 20 through
[1:24:42] 22. If you would continue to pray for me
[1:24:45] this week, I would greatly appreciate
[1:24:47] it. I had an appointment with the eye
[1:24:49] doctor on Friday and uh he is sending me
[1:24:53] to a specialist
[1:24:55] uh for my left eye. He told me uh I'm
[1:24:59] glad you give me a lot of good news. He
[1:25:02] told me that uh on one side of my eye
[1:25:05] the my vision has improved and uh at
[1:25:09] your age that doesn't generally
[1:25:12] happen. Well, that was good to hear. And
[1:25:15] then he told me that uh I had nerves in
[1:25:18] one part of the sheath of my eye that
[1:25:21] looked like a
[1:25:22] teenager. And I didn't know if that was
[1:25:25] true or flattery. I wasn't real sure
[1:25:26] about that. He is a very uh direct
[1:25:30] little fellow. I hope he never hears
[1:25:33] this. He is quite
[1:25:35] nerdy. That's why I go to him because I
[1:25:38] trust him. He is very thorough and uh
[1:25:41] I'm hoping that he is thorough to a
[1:25:43] fault this time. But anyway, he's
[1:25:47] sending me to a cornea specialist
[1:25:50] because there's a spot on my left eye
[1:25:53] that was three years ago. It was uh
[1:25:56] clear and a little looked like a little
[1:25:58] gel in it or something. He's not sure
[1:26:00] exactly what it is, but now there is
[1:26:03] some pigmentation in it. There's a
[1:26:05] there's coloration in it and that has
[1:26:07] concerned him. So, he's sending me to a
[1:26:10] specialist for a biopsy to check for
[1:26:12] malignancy in my left eye. Well, I don't
[1:26:15] believe that, but I suppose I ought to
[1:26:19] at least go see what they have to say.
[1:26:21] Um, I doubt very seriously where I'm
[1:26:23] going to let them put a needle in my
[1:26:24] eyeball anyway. Uh, that doesn't sound
[1:26:27] too exciting, does it? But God knows.
[1:26:30] The main thing, the reason why I'm
[1:26:32] telling you is that you would pray uh
[1:26:34] pray against the enemy and pray for the
[1:26:38] perfect word of God to be manifested.
[1:26:40] And you know, it doesn't matter what it
[1:26:42] is. It it could be that God will just
[1:26:44] let it go and when they when they put
[1:26:47] the microscope on it next time, it could
[1:26:49] be that it won't even be there. That
[1:26:51] would be my prayer. Thank you for for
[1:26:54] praying for us that God will give us
[1:26:55] that peace that passes all understanding
[1:26:58] and we can get that looked at and be
[1:27:00] done with it. Proverbs 26 verses 20
[1:27:04] through 22. Where no wood
[1:27:07] is there the fire goeth out. May I ask
[1:27:13] you if you have experienced that anytime
[1:27:15] you've had a fire, a camp fire or a
[1:27:18] trash fire or whatever kind of fire it
[1:27:20] was, a weenie fire, a marshmallow fire,
[1:27:24] whatever you call them, uh if you don't
[1:27:26] feed the thing, it goes out. There are
[1:27:29] times that you want the fire to stay
[1:27:31] ever burning. Amen. And so in order for
[1:27:35] it to stay ever burning, you got to keep
[1:27:37] feeding fuel to it. It consumes whatever
[1:27:41] wood you put in or trash or whatever it
[1:27:45] is. There are times that the fire needs
[1:27:48] to go out. And we need to be able to
[1:27:50] recognize a fire that is not of God. And
[1:27:54] we need to starve it uh from any fuel.
[1:27:59] We would not feed it. We wouldn't poke
[1:28:01] it and stoke it and uh use the bellows
[1:28:05] on it. Hot air, right?
[1:28:08] leave our hot air off of it so that it
[1:28:11] will die out. Where no wood is, there
[1:28:13] the fire goeth out. So where there is no
[1:28:17] tailbearer, the strife ceaseth because
[1:28:21] there's no fuel. If you won't don't run
[1:28:24] and tell it, it'll soon be as though it
[1:28:27] never existed. Are you with me? The
[1:28:30] strife ceaseth. As coals are to to
[1:28:34] burning coals and wood to
[1:28:38] fire, so is a contentious man to kindle
[1:28:42] strive. And may we say a a woman can
[1:28:46] also be contentious
[1:28:48] and she can kindle strive. And he and
[1:28:52] she can keep putting wood on a fire that
[1:28:57] needs to go out. The
[1:28:59] words of a
[1:29:01] tailbearer are as
[1:29:05] wounds and they go down into the
[1:29:08] innermost parts of the
[1:29:12] belly. I find that last verse to be a
[1:29:15] fascinating verse. Father, we are here
[1:29:20] today believing that you are working on
[1:29:24] our testimony.
[1:29:26] Uh sometimes it pinches us and sometimes
[1:29:29] it convicts us and sometimes we feel a
[1:29:33] little shame. We have to pray back
[1:29:35] through that because it is not your
[1:29:38] desire to heap condemnation on us or
[1:29:42] shame or guilt. It is your desire to set
[1:29:45] us free from all of those things. But
[1:29:48] Lord, it's peaceful to know that you're
[1:29:51] working on us and that you are
[1:29:53] sovereign. We pray today in the mighty
[1:29:56] name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you
[1:29:59] will direct our thoughts and our hearts
[1:30:02] as we approach your word today and we
[1:30:05] will give you glory, honor, and praise
[1:30:07] for it's in the mighty name of the Lord
[1:30:09] Jesus Christ, Yeshua, our Messiah, that
[1:30:12] we pray. And the saint said, "Amen." You
[1:30:16] may be seated. Stay with me if you
[1:30:18] possibly can. I'd like to read those
[1:30:21] verses in the
[1:30:22] amplified and not generally most of the
[1:30:27] time I like to give the amplified at
[1:30:30] times when I believe that uh some of the
[1:30:33] words are a little hard to understand in
[1:30:36] uh modern English. This time I'm giving
[1:30:39] the amplified because it appears that
[1:30:42] the translators have put the Hebrew word
[1:30:45] in the wrong form. Now this happens and
[1:30:49] we can always say that it's still
[1:30:52] inherent. It's the word of God. There's
[1:30:55] a reason for it and it is appropriate in
[1:30:58] fact because these kinds of situations
[1:31:03] can be
[1:31:04] wounds. Is that right?
[1:31:08] Uh, that is the noun form of the word
[1:31:12] and no other translation that I know of
[1:31:16] uses the noun, excuse me, the verb form.
[1:31:19] That's the verb form. No other
[1:31:21] translation that I know of uses the verb
[1:31:25] form because this is a noun in the
[1:31:28] sentence. But for some reason it was
[1:31:32] that they took the other form of the
[1:31:35] same Hebrew word and it reads as a
[1:31:39] wound. So I want you to hear it in the
[1:31:43] amplified and then I'm going to show you
[1:31:44] the word so that you can fully
[1:31:47] understand this verse of scripture. I
[1:31:49] want to understand it for myself. The
[1:31:52] scripture said in amplified verse 20,
[1:31:55] for lack of wood, the fire goes out. And
[1:31:59] where there is no whisperer instead of
[1:32:01] tailbearer, that's what a tail bearer
[1:32:03] is. You don't usually take the
[1:32:06] microphone and be a tail bearer. You
[1:32:08] usually do that in covert ways, quiet
[1:32:16] ways. That can really give you a
[1:32:19] complex.
[1:32:21] If you walk in a room and
[1:32:23] everybody's and looking in your
[1:32:25] direction, why anybody would almost
[1:32:29] assume that they're the one being about,
[1:32:34] right? So, uh, a tailbearer is usually
[1:32:38] someone who whispers these things. Where
[1:32:41] there is no whisperer, contention
[1:32:43] ceases. May I just summarize that to say
[1:32:47] if we would be less likely to carry a
[1:32:52] tale about one of our brothers and
[1:32:57] sisters in the faith. We would live a
[1:33:01] much more peaceful life. church and
[1:33:05] fellowship meetings and lunches and
[1:33:08] birthday parties and uh whatever else
[1:33:12] we're celebrating would be a more
[1:33:14] peaceful, less nerve-wracking
[1:33:17] uh
[1:33:18] anxious sort of
[1:33:21] atmosphere. Uh it would no longer be
[1:33:23] quite as contentious among us because we
[1:33:27] would know that our brothers and sisters
[1:33:30] have our best interest.
[1:33:32] We wouldn't ask you to look above our
[1:33:35] faults or to pretend as though we have
[1:33:38] none. Why? We're not even that fooled.
[1:33:42] But we would appreciate it. I would
[1:33:44] appreciate it and I know others would
[1:33:47] appreciate it if we could come to a
[1:33:50] place where we would not feel the need
[1:33:54] to keep adding fire to something that
[1:33:58] happens among us. You see, we're such a
[1:34:01] small church and and such a family
[1:34:04] church and we have so many relatives
[1:34:07] also in the church. Uh uh you know, it's
[1:34:10] either by blood or by uh uh outlawin-law
[1:34:14] relationship. You understand? And so
[1:34:17] even a family matter can become a big
[1:34:20] matter, a contentious matter in a body
[1:34:22] like ours. Can you say amen? Amen. As so
[1:34:26] that we walk into a room and you feel
[1:34:29] the tension and you feel the tightness
[1:34:31] or maybe someone sings a song and you
[1:34:34] feel the tightness or they give a little
[1:34:36] testimony and you feel that tightness.
[1:34:39] Normally that comes because uh someone
[1:34:43] has been
[1:34:47] whispering. Facts are facts and people
[1:34:51] are people and they're just strange.
[1:34:57] You know, that's what I've learned about
[1:34:59] people. People are just
[1:35:02] odd. And if we were all the same, it
[1:35:06] would be a boring world.
[1:35:08] We'd have to find something creatively
[1:35:10] to say about somebody if we were all
[1:35:13] just alike. And the reality is most of
[1:35:17] us wish that everybody was like us.
[1:35:22] But our pastor doesn't hope
[1:35:24] that we are supposed to be individuals
[1:35:27] and we're supposed to have our own
[1:35:30] personalities.
[1:35:32] You don't have to like the same kind of
[1:35:34] pie that somebody else likes. And I know
[1:35:37] there's some who have particular uh
[1:35:40] fondness of certain colors. And some
[1:35:42] people have uh a certain apprehension
[1:35:44] about wearing certain colors or driving
[1:35:47] a car of a certain color. and uh and and
[1:35:51] uh you know, everybody is not going to
[1:35:53] be the same. Brother Brandham said we're
[1:35:55] just like flowers in a garden. We're not
[1:35:58] all the same. God has an order. We ought
[1:36:02] to respect that order.
[1:36:05] We should respect the order of the Lord.
[1:36:08] But we should not try to cause others to
[1:36:11] dislike what we dislike or like what we
[1:36:14] like. Even in gospel music, some people
[1:36:16] have different styles and tastes. And uh
[1:36:20] like I've told you before, you better
[1:36:21] get all of that out of you here because
[1:36:24] I'm quite sure that the music in heaven
[1:36:27] is going to be southern gospel.
[1:36:32] So go ahead and listen to the other
[1:36:34] genres here because you're probably
[1:36:36] going to ha have to hear four-part
[1:36:38] harmony throughout all eternity with the
[1:36:41] lowest down bass singer and the highest
[1:36:43] tenor singer you can imagine. We know
[1:36:45] that's not how it is. We're
[1:36:48] kidding. Make sure you know that on the
[1:36:51] stream. We're kidding. I don't think
[1:36:54] we're all going to only sing hymns from
[1:36:56] the 1950s, though.
[1:36:59] I believe God's still inspiring songs
[1:37:03] and and even if I don't like a
[1:37:05] particular song, it's usually because
[1:37:07] I'm identifying the song with who sings
[1:37:10] it.
[1:37:11] Sometimes I don't even know who wrote
[1:37:13] it, but I know who sings it. And I may
[1:37:16] not particularly like that singer, or
[1:37:18] they may have excessively long hair as a
[1:37:21] man or shorter hair as a woman, and I
[1:37:24] don't like that. So, I might somehow uh
[1:37:27] uh unintentionally judge a song by who's
[1:37:30] singing it. That's not right. We don't
[1:37:32] want to be that kind of people, do we?
[1:37:35] We don't want to be the kind of people
[1:37:36] that uh spend all of our
[1:37:39] fellowship talking bad about somebody
[1:37:43] else.
[1:37:44] There are times that we have to discuss
[1:37:47] situations that are caused because of
[1:37:51] folks and their various opinions and
[1:37:53] ways of doing things. But you and I
[1:37:56] ought to be a people that try to keep as
[1:37:58] much wood off the pile as possible so
[1:38:02] that the fire will quickly burn out.
[1:38:05] We are looking at the forms, the faces
[1:38:09] of manipulation.
[1:38:11] This is above all else part
[1:38:14] 26. We're working on part four of how
[1:38:17] manipulation and offense work together.
[1:38:20] And we're working on part three of the
[1:38:22] many faces of control or manipulation.
[1:38:25] And we've made it through. If you want
[1:38:26] to see the list, number one, guilt
[1:38:28] tripping. We've covered that. Using
[1:38:31] guilt to cause someone to do what you
[1:38:34] want them to do, trying to make them
[1:38:35] feel guilty for what you've done for
[1:38:37] them. If you do something because you're
[1:38:40] looking long-term, I might be able to
[1:38:43] have more control in their life. You're
[1:38:46] just a
[1:38:50] witch. Can I just tell you that that is
[1:38:53] witchcraft?
[1:38:55] The Bible said
[1:38:56] so. We're not supposed to try to do
[1:38:59] something for somebody to gain some
[1:39:01] favor so that we can then get them to do
[1:39:04] how we want them to do. Uh, it's worse
[1:39:07] than
[1:39:08] bribery. It's subtle manipulation, which
[1:39:11] is really casting a spell or bewitching
[1:39:14] someone to do something that you want
[1:39:17] them to do. And you're thinking way
[1:39:18] ahead, I'm going to need now such and
[1:39:20] such a date is coming up and I'm going
[1:39:22] to need them to do so and so, so let me
[1:39:25] butter them up real good now so that
[1:39:27] when that day comes, they'll be more
[1:39:29] likely to blah blah blah or whatever
[1:39:32] whatever the situation is. Uh, don't do
[1:39:34] that.
[1:39:36] If you're going to do something for
[1:39:37] somebody, do it out of a heart of love.
[1:39:40] Amen.
[1:39:42] No, no. Uh, you know, no strings
[1:39:46] attached and no hope for later
[1:39:50] manipulation. Just do it because you
[1:39:52] love to see the look on their face. How
[1:39:54] many of you like to see somebody happy
[1:39:56] with what you do for them or what you
[1:39:58] give them? And I I had so many beautiful
[1:40:00] things given to me for my birthday.
[1:40:03] Sweet things, thoughtful things. I think
[1:40:06] the cards this year meant more to me. I
[1:40:08] guess I'm old, getting older. Uh I I
[1:40:11] think what people wrote in the cards
[1:40:13] meant more to me this year than it ever
[1:40:14] has before. And little little
[1:40:18] thoughts. Sister, one one sister, let me
[1:40:21] just say it that way. One sister gave me
[1:40:23] a little something about for such a time
[1:40:25] as this. and and I'd never had that
[1:40:28] little slogan on a a little plaque or
[1:40:30] anything before. And it meant so much to
[1:40:32] me. And one brother had a special card
[1:40:36] made for me that that uh played the song
[1:40:39] that I mentioned sometime, God leads his
[1:40:42] dear children along. Because I'd mention
[1:40:45] how that in a dark dark time in my life
[1:40:48] on the porch in a rocking chair, I would
[1:40:51] sing that song and God would use it to
[1:40:53] lift my spirit. So, I've kept that card
[1:40:56] close to me. I've had to open it up a
[1:40:58] time or two already this week, hearing
[1:41:00] the tune again. So, things really meant,
[1:41:03] but I don't believe that anybody gave me
[1:41:05] anything because they hope to control me
[1:41:08] later if you
[1:41:13] did. The joke is on
[1:41:17] you because this the way things are
[1:41:20] leaving me fast these days. I may not
[1:41:23] even remember next week what you give
[1:41:25] me. So anyway, we don't want to you I've
[1:41:28] seen it in
[1:41:30] families. I I've even seen parents be
[1:41:33] better to one child than another child.
[1:41:37] Not because they just wanted to favor
[1:41:39] this child, but because they wanted to
[1:41:41] get
[1:41:43] at. They're sending a subtle message
[1:41:46] over here to this child by doing
[1:41:50] something more. What's going to happen
[1:41:52] when this child wakes up and realizes
[1:41:55] that you're just using them like a pawn
[1:41:58] to send a message to child B?
[1:42:01] Don't tell me that these things don't go
[1:42:03] on because I've watched them happen in
[1:42:06] everyday life. Silent
[1:42:09] treatment. Uh I told little Aiana when
[1:42:12] she first came in my office today, we're
[1:42:15] just talking to her and she's looking
[1:42:16] and but she's not answering and she's
[1:42:18] not responding and she starts down the
[1:42:20] hall and I hollered after her. Hope she
[1:42:22] don't know what I said, but I hollered
[1:42:24] after her. I said, "You know the silent
[1:42:25] treatment is manipulation, Aiana."
[1:42:30] She wasn't trying to manipulate pap
[1:42:32] pastor. She was she just wasn't going to
[1:42:35] talk. She just had nothing to say at the
[1:42:37] moment. Which uh parents can get pretty
[1:42:40] excited about that on occasion when they
[1:42:42] don't want when they're when they
[1:42:43] finally are stopped babbling. But
[1:42:46] anyway, silent treatment, false
[1:42:48] humility, and this martyr complex, you
[1:42:50] know, oh, I just been you just don't
[1:42:53] understand. And then reverse psychology.
[1:42:56] We talked about it Tuesday night. how
[1:42:58] that people will get you to uh to say
[1:43:02] things or choose things because really
[1:43:05] it's what they want and so they do it in
[1:43:07] this very odd way. I I'm probably not
[1:43:11] talking about trying to get somebody to
[1:43:13] go to the restaurant that you want to go
[1:43:15] to. I'm talking about more serious forms
[1:43:18] of meddling in people's lives than that.
[1:43:22] And God is cleaning up. He's cleaning up
[1:43:25] some things in us. Amen. So today we're
[1:43:29] looking at
[1:43:31] triangulation. Triangulation is bringing
[1:43:33] in third parties to apply
[1:43:37] pressure. We used to call that ganging
[1:43:40] up on someone. How many of you have ever
[1:43:43] been ganged up on? I don't mean an
[1:43:47] intervention. I I mean just everybody.
[1:43:50] Everybody at one time. How many of you
[1:43:52] know that can be quite overwhelming?
[1:43:54] So this scripture tells us in the
[1:43:56] amplified as coals are to hot embers and
[1:44:00] as wood to fire so is a quarrelome man
[1:44:04] to inflame strife. This word is
[1:44:07] translated here
[1:44:09] quarrelome. It means someone who likes
[1:44:12] to argue. We say argumentative. Let me
[1:44:16] see if you've ever known anybody,
[1:44:18] fellowship with anybody, been canned to
[1:44:20] anybody that was under an argumentative
[1:44:23] spirit. I have. We've had leaders in our
[1:44:27] church who were under that argumentative
[1:44:31] spirit. They were just looking for
[1:44:33] strife to stir a little bit, very
[1:44:36] carefully, sort of under radar,
[1:44:39] nonetheless adding wood to the fire. God
[1:44:43] is not pleased with that.
[1:44:46] Amen. Brother Greley's never been guilty
[1:44:48] of that kind of don't don't dare think
[1:44:51] that I'm here talking about him. He may
[1:44:55] not be as sweet as he used to be, but he
[1:44:59] definitely does not stir strife.
[1:45:03] What I ought to say is he may not look
[1:45:05] quite as young as he used to look. He
[1:45:07] still looks pretty young, but it's never
[1:45:10] been his position. I'm calling his name
[1:45:13] because I said the word leader and I
[1:45:15] don't want you to mistake what I'm
[1:45:17] saying. The words of a whisperer or a
[1:45:20] slanderer are like, now here's where we
[1:45:23] get the right form of the
[1:45:26] word. They are like
[1:45:29] dainty
[1:45:34] morsels or words of sport to
[1:45:38] some but to others are like deadly
[1:45:43] wounds. Now here's what you need to
[1:45:45] understand about the amplified. What I
[1:45:48] appreciate about it is in situations
[1:45:51] where a word has two
[1:45:53] forms, both definitions are in the
[1:45:57] brackets. They want you to know that the
[1:46:00] word could have been translated one way.
[1:46:03] Here is another way. They're not saying
[1:46:05] that, but instead they're giving you
[1:46:08] both implications of the word, both
[1:46:12] wounds and something else.
[1:46:16] I'll show it to you in just a moment.
[1:46:18] They're
[1:46:19] like dainty morsels. What do you think
[1:46:22] about? Give me some uh example of a
[1:46:25] dainty
[1:46:27] morsel. When you think of a dainty
[1:46:29] morsel, what do you think about? I
[1:46:32] didn't think you were dainty morsel
[1:46:34] people. Well, I'll tell you what I think
[1:46:36] about. What? What did you
[1:46:38] say? Yes. a little petty for uh which is
[1:46:43] a a starving man's uh grump. You know,
[1:46:48] when someone puts you're going to have
[1:46:49] dessert and they bring out one little
[1:46:52] pett on a doily paper doily on a little
[1:46:56] dish and that little thing is sitting
[1:46:58] there like that and you're thinking, uh,
[1:47:00] I need about 30 more of these to make up
[1:47:02] a When I think of Danny Marcel, I think
[1:47:06] of Turkish
[1:47:07] delight. And I do that because of the
[1:47:10] Narnia books and how wasn't it Edmund
[1:47:14] who had a he had a particular fondness
[1:47:17] of Turkish delights and they're little
[1:47:21] jelly like fruit jelly like treats from
[1:47:26] the really from the Middle East. That's
[1:47:28] where it originates the area of Turkey.
[1:47:32] And they're layered and they're usually
[1:47:34] covered in something like a powdered
[1:47:36] sugar, but it's almost like a glaze so
[1:47:39] that you you a glaze and then the sugar
[1:47:41] on top you pick it up. I like them, but
[1:47:43] it's not something I crave. I don't
[1:47:45] think one day in my life I've ever woke
[1:47:47] up and said, "My I want a petty for or I
[1:47:50] think today I'd like to have Turkish
[1:47:52] delight." But anyway, uh he was so fond
[1:47:55] of Turkish delight that he was willing
[1:47:57] to sell his soul
[1:48:00] almost to the deception of the
[1:48:03] witch because she was able to provide
[1:48:06] those little morsels, those little
[1:48:08] dainty
[1:48:09] morsels. And so I like the way this is
[1:48:13] translated. The words of a whisperer or
[1:48:15] slanderer are like little dainty
[1:48:20] morsels to
[1:48:22] some, but to
[1:48:24] others like deadly
[1:48:26] wounds, and they go down into the
[1:48:30] innermost parts of the body. I never
[1:48:32] could understand why the wound was
[1:48:35] associated with something going down
[1:48:38] into the innermost part of the body, but
[1:48:40] now I do. It's just a different form of
[1:48:42] the word. They go down into the
[1:48:44] innermost parts of the body or of the
[1:48:48] victim's
[1:48:50] nature. These things can change
[1:48:53] personalities
[1:48:55] and change
[1:48:57] characteristics if we're not careful.
[1:49:00] You can really mess somebody up
[1:49:02] emotionally by continuing to fuel the
[1:49:06] fire. Yes, I hesitate to mention that it
[1:49:11] happened in our
[1:49:13] community. There were some terrible
[1:49:15] things that came out some time back
[1:49:18] about our
[1:49:19] mayor and they were vile things. They
[1:49:22] were awful things. They were definitely
[1:49:25] unnatural and perverted
[1:49:28] things. But it was his private life.
[1:49:33] I would never justify his sin, my sin,
[1:49:37] or anyone else's sin. But a community
[1:49:41] that had once sung his
[1:49:43] praise overnight because of some poor
[1:49:48] journalism, his name was
[1:49:51] ruined. His life ruined. I don't know if
[1:49:55] you know this or not, but the news
[1:49:57] agency that brought these things to the
[1:49:59] light, it exists no more. And those who
[1:50:03] are involved are uh in in spreading that
[1:50:06] kind of stuff are are facing quite a few
[1:50:10] charges and will be tried in a court of
[1:50:13] law for the way they pedled these
[1:50:17] things. No no crime particularly
[1:50:21] involved just hints of of of criminal
[1:50:24] activity. I I couldn't help. No one
[1:50:28] despises that kind of wrong more than I.
[1:50:32] But I I couldn't help but feel sad that
[1:50:36] he went from being such a well-known,
[1:50:39] well-loved, wellthought of person who
[1:50:41] did so many things for the community and
[1:50:44] he ended his life over there on the
[1:50:46] highway because he felt like there would
[1:50:49] be no way to come back from that kind of
[1:50:51] a thing. So that is what this verse is
[1:50:54] saying to me.
[1:50:57] Some people get such
[1:50:59] delight like little morsels of of of
[1:51:03] candy when they stir these contentious
[1:51:07] words that can become deep wounds. But
[1:51:10] to others, they they're wounds and they
[1:51:12] go way down in their inner being and and
[1:51:15] force them to feel hopeless.
[1:51:18] I'm telling you, church, we've got to be
[1:51:20] careful about uh triangulation, about
[1:51:24] involving other
[1:51:25] people, about pulling other people into
[1:51:28] our
[1:51:30] opinion against somebody's behavior.
[1:51:34] We've got to be clean before the Lord.
[1:51:37] The only ones who will be able to ascend
[1:51:40] the holy hill of the Lord are those who
[1:51:42] have a pure heart and clean hands. And
[1:51:46] if we're responsible for helping
[1:51:49] assassinate somebody's character by
[1:51:52] adding wood to the fire with
[1:51:55] speculation,
[1:51:56] especially that causes
[1:51:59] suspicion, God's going to hold us
[1:52:02] accountable because believers are going
[1:52:04] to be evaluated by every word
[1:52:09] that comes out of their mouth. This is
[1:52:12] why Jesus tells us, "Let your yes be yes
[1:52:16] and your no be no and then you won't be
[1:52:19] guilty of profanity,
[1:52:21] words that are vain and have little
[1:52:24] meaning." Show me that word if you would
[1:52:27] translated in in the King James as
[1:52:29] wounds. Also uh uh used here as an
[1:52:33] alternative translation in the
[1:52:35] amplified. Uh the word is lam and it
[1:52:39] means to swallow
[1:52:42] [Music]
[1:52:44] greedily as a passive noun. It means
[1:52:47] something
[1:52:49] gulped. To swallow greedily, something
[1:52:52] to be gulped. It is used to describe
[1:52:55] gossip as something that most people
[1:52:58] will swallow
[1:53:01] whole and be permeated by it.
[1:53:05] You see, the King James translators
[1:53:08] chose the verb form, which is a
[1:53:11] wound like a gash or a cut or or bursted
[1:53:19] tissue is one of the words that is used
[1:53:22] in the explanation of uh
[1:53:26] wound. But
[1:53:29] probably they should have chosen it's
[1:53:32] the same word but they probably should
[1:53:34] have chosen uh this noun form that that
[1:53:39] is talking about
[1:53:41] uh something to be swallowed or or
[1:53:46] gulped
[1:53:47] gossip. How many of you know there are
[1:53:50] people who thrive on
[1:53:55] hearing? I believe they call it now
[1:54:01] tea. I like tea, especially iced tea. I
[1:54:06] wish you wouldn't use
[1:54:09] tea. They say, "Do you have any tea for
[1:54:13] me?" And you go to the
[1:54:16] fridge or to the cabinet. But what they
[1:54:19] mean is, "You got any
[1:54:21] gossip?" News.
[1:54:24] Christians only use
[1:54:25] news,
[1:54:27] right? H Have you got any dirt, any mud?
[1:54:32] That's what we used to say. You You can
[1:54:35] clean it up. You can call it what you
[1:54:37] want to, but it ought not to be as
[1:54:40] prevalent as it is among believers.
[1:54:44] And some people just gulp it up. If they
[1:54:48] can get in a conversation where people
[1:54:50] are being shredded,
[1:54:53] they just thrive.
[1:54:56] I find myself sometime having to
[1:54:58] separate myself uh from the atmosphere
[1:55:01] simply because I can always add my two
[1:55:06] cents. You see, I know more about things
[1:55:08] than some people
[1:55:10] do. And sometimes if you're not careful,
[1:55:13] you you'll get caught up. You might even
[1:55:16] instigate.
[1:55:18] Maybe it's time for us to just pull
[1:55:21] ourselves
[1:55:22] away if necessary so that we don't
[1:55:26] become guilty of of giving these little
[1:55:29] dainty morsels to people who are
[1:55:34] greedy, who thrive on being able to
[1:55:37] swallow up something negative, something
[1:55:41] bad, something odd about someone else.
[1:55:46] If that's where we get our validation or
[1:55:49] our uh happy feeling, then something is
[1:55:52] terribly wrong in our own life. I'm
[1:55:56] waiting on your amen.
[1:55:58] That word is used the same way in
[1:56:00] Proverbs 18:8. Let's look at it. I have
[1:56:03] to move on. The words of a tailbearer
[1:56:06] are as wounds and they go down into the
[1:56:09] innermost parts of the belly. Doesn't
[1:56:11] that sound just like the verse that I
[1:56:13] read ahead of time? It doesn't. It bared
[1:56:16] repeating. It was mentioned again. And
[1:56:19] in the amplified, it means the words of
[1:56:21] a whisperer or tailbearer are as dainty
[1:56:24] morsels. They go down into the innermost
[1:56:27] parts of the body. Do you know what that
[1:56:29] means? It means they affect the soul.
[1:56:32] The soul is the mind and the will and
[1:56:35] the emotion. In a healthy believer, the
[1:56:39] regenerated spirit is feeding life to
[1:56:43] the soul and to the body. But in a a
[1:56:47] human where things are out of order and
[1:56:50] where the soul is getting more food than
[1:56:53] the spirit man, the the regenerated
[1:56:56] spirit man feeds only on the word.
[1:57:01] Anybody here?
[1:57:03] And so if you are uh feeding on other
[1:57:06] things, of course we need moderation in
[1:57:10] everything.
[1:57:13] You know, moderation for YouTube.
[1:57:19] Don't give up an a television addiction
[1:57:22] for YouTube addiction.
[1:57:25] Hello.
[1:57:27] Moderation. Because whatever you receive
[1:57:30] through these gates of our body, we it
[1:57:33] goes right into the soul which is the
[1:57:36] mind and the will and the emotion. And
[1:57:39] depending on whether you are stronger in
[1:57:42] your spirit or your soul, you have to
[1:57:45] reverse that for for folks around the
[1:57:47] message. So put that most of them
[1:57:49] majority of them have it in the other
[1:57:51] order. So you kind of have to reverse
[1:57:53] that for them. But in the order that it
[1:57:55] is mentioned in scripture, uh it's soul
[1:57:59] in the middle, mind, will and emotions.
[1:58:02] Everything that we see and hear and
[1:58:04] taste and feel, it goes into the flesh
[1:58:08] and from there filters into the soul. If
[1:58:11] the soul is being fed more than the
[1:58:15] spirit is being fed, the soul rules.
[1:58:19] And we live based on our own mind, our
[1:58:22] own will, our own emotions, while our
[1:58:25] spirit man shrinks.
[1:58:27] But if you're feasting, if you're
[1:58:29] feeding the inner spirit on the word of
[1:58:32] God, it's getting stronger and stronger.
[1:58:35] We often use the analogy of a
[1:58:38] stickman, which is about the only man I
[1:58:41] can draw, and a sumo wrestler. Who knows
[1:58:44] what a sumo wrestler looks like? Don't
[1:58:47] say
[1:58:49] me because they don't make diapers in my
[1:58:52] size. But moving right along, you see
[1:58:55] this huge man, bun on his head, like a
[1:58:59] bone in his hair, big
[1:59:02] belly. And don't let that big belly fool
[1:59:05] you because he can he can throw down an
[1:59:09] opponent, can't he? Uh that little old
[1:59:11] stick man, he's not even good enough,
[1:59:14] strong enough to hold up his own hat.
[1:59:16] He's just one line and two little sticks
[1:59:19] and for for arms and two little sticks
[1:59:21] for leg. I want you to know that some of
[1:59:24] us are walking around with a soul that
[1:59:27] looks like a sumo wrestler and a spirit
[1:59:30] man that looks like a stick man. I'm
[1:59:33] going to wait on you to say amen.
[1:59:35] Because we're feeding this sumo wrestler
[1:59:38] with all the stuff out there. All the
[1:59:41] stuff. Our mind is overstimulated by
[1:59:45] stuff. Our will is getting more stubborn
[1:59:48] because of stuff that we take in. And
[1:59:51] our emotions are getting more unnatural
[1:59:54] and uncontrollable
[1:59:57] because the soul is getting fat.
[2:00:00] If we can turn that thing around and
[2:00:03] begin to feed the spirit man, worship
[2:00:06] music, the word of God, the messages of
[2:00:10] the prophet, uh going back over a
[2:00:13] service at church, reading your Bible,
[2:00:16] hearing the devotion, doing whatever it
[2:00:19] is to feed the spirit man, then the
[2:00:23] stick man that's in our spirit, he
[2:00:25] begins to grow up and he begins to get
[2:00:28] stronger. And what happens automatically
[2:00:31] [Music]
[2:00:33] is the soul gets smaller.
[2:00:37] Mind, will and emotions get lessened.
[2:00:40] And we start living out of the spirit. I
[2:00:44] know that I may be taking a long time
[2:00:47] with this, but I think you should hear
[2:00:49] it
[2:00:50] because I don't want to offend you, but
[2:00:52] I want to tell you that that some of you
[2:00:54] are are uh quite
[2:00:56] fat in your emotions.
[2:01:00] Your mind, your will, your emotions are
[2:01:03] getting the most nourishment
[2:01:05] and the spirit man is shrinking and then
[2:01:08] you you want prayer because you're
[2:01:11] struggling. We all struggle,
[2:01:15] but sometimes our struggle, Jonathan, is
[2:01:18] simply because we're feeding the wrong
[2:01:20] part of who we are.
[2:01:23] It's also possible to feed the flesh
[2:01:25] more than we feed the soul and the
[2:01:27] spirit. you know, spending everything we
[2:01:30] have on on manicure and pedicure and uh
[2:01:34] Botox.
[2:01:38] Eyelashes have to be curled just right
[2:01:41] and and eyebrows have to be uh uh glued
[2:01:45] on or painted on and and and and
[2:01:49] eyelashes glued on and fingernails glued
[2:01:54] on.
[2:01:56] Man, one woman told me a couple years
[2:01:59] ago, I even Brother Brandham said, "If
[2:02:01] you don't have fingernails, you can get
[2:02:02] you some." I said, "Do you know anybody
[2:02:04] that doesn't have any
[2:02:08] fingernails?" She said, "Well, no. I've
[2:02:10] never met anybody." I said, "Neither
[2:02:11] have
[2:02:12] I. He certainly didn't mean if you don't
[2:02:15] have cat
[2:02:16] claws, go get you some cat claws glued
[2:02:20] on."
[2:02:23] It's possible to feed the flesh to make
[2:02:26] that the stronger part of who you are.
[2:02:28] Pampering ourselves.
[2:02:30] It's all right to take care of
[2:02:32] ourselves. Uh you should especially in
[2:02:35] the areas of deodorant and shampoo and
[2:02:38] soap and these are good things to have.
[2:02:42] Pamper your flesh. Please, by all
[2:02:44] means, I I give you permission. Pamper
[2:02:48] your flesh in that regard. But don't let
[2:02:51] your driving focus become propping this
[2:02:55] old body up. It's going to fail you.
[2:02:57] It's going to deteriorate. It's part of
[2:03:00] God's plan. It's shrinking away.
[2:03:05] Hallelujah. How could you be excited
[2:03:07] about that? Because it has to give way
[2:03:10] to another body
[2:03:12] that's already mine. It's already
[2:03:16] mine. This one has to give way. So
[2:03:18] whatever part of the tripartate man you
[2:03:21] feed the most is the one that's going to
[2:03:23] rule the roost.
[2:03:25] And if you're spending your time putting
[2:03:27] wood on the fire of gossip and
[2:03:29] contention and criticism,
[2:03:33] the soul is thriving and the spirit man
[2:03:36] is crying out for help. Feed that spirit
[2:03:41] man. Don't carry tails.
[2:03:46] Did you hear?
[2:03:49] That's how it start. Did you hear? Did
[2:03:52] you see? Did you
[2:03:56] know? Boldly refuse to be drawn in to
[2:04:00] someone's offense
[2:04:03] with someone else.
[2:04:06] He sure offended me. She sure hurt my
[2:04:09] feelings. The reality is this. We all
[2:04:13] have feelings. They all get hurt.
[2:04:17] Don't you want to just make up your mind
[2:04:20] that by the next time you see that
[2:04:23] person, you've already let it go. Clean
[2:04:28] slate. Some folks are waiting. Look this
[2:04:31] way. Some of you are waiting on
[2:04:33] apologies
[2:04:35] that will never come.
[2:04:39] They're never going to
[2:04:40] come for whatever reason. They're never
[2:04:43] going to come.
[2:04:44] Don't you live your life below your mean
[2:04:48] below spiritual potential because you're
[2:04:51] waiting on someone to apologize and and
[2:04:54] then you're going to have those
[2:04:55] aggravating ones
[2:04:59] who apologize for everything and
[2:05:01] therefore you never can really have full
[2:05:04] confidence in the apology because they
[2:05:06] use I'm
[2:05:08] sorry like some preachers use amen when
[2:05:11] they're preaching.
[2:05:16] Don't don't don't throw that away. Don't
[2:05:18] don't apologize so often that it means
[2:05:22] nothing when it's necessary and needed.
[2:05:26] Have a little
[2:05:28] confidence. Be careful how you fall into
[2:05:31] this need to pull somebody else into
[2:05:34] your stuff. Is anybody listening?
[2:05:38] I want to give you the definition of
[2:05:40] triangulation and psychology. Well, I
[2:05:42] didn't come here to hear psychology. No,
[2:05:45] but I've had to look at it because of
[2:05:46] some of you
[2:05:49] sometimes. I looked to God's word to try
[2:05:51] to figure you out. I couldn't find
[2:05:55] you. So, sometime I had to figure, Lord,
[2:05:58] what in the world is making this person
[2:06:01] do what they're to do? And but I know
[2:06:03] the highest order of truth is God's word
[2:06:06] always. When I started defining
[2:06:08] triangulation, this was what I what I
[2:06:11] come up with. And I thought better. I
[2:06:13] thought maybe I better not do it like
[2:06:15] this. Somebody will. But you know
[2:06:19] anyway, triangulation is a term in
[2:06:22] psychology most closely associated with
[2:06:24] the work of Murray Bowen. Uh and that is
[2:06:28] a specialist in family therapy. And I'll
[2:06:30] tell you sometimes that could be
[2:06:33] helpful. Bowen considered a twoperson
[2:06:36] emotional system to be unstable.
[2:06:40] He also observed that two people seem
[2:06:44] emotionally
[2:06:49] closer. Are you
[2:06:53] cheating? When excluding a third
[2:06:56] party, this is why some people thrive on
[2:07:02] triangles because they feel closer to
[2:07:05] the person that they're with at the
[2:07:08] moment.
[2:07:13] by
[2:07:16] excluding or
[2:07:18] criticizing the third
[2:07:21] angle, the third person in the
[2:07:26] triangle. Relationships are not made to
[2:07:29] be
[2:07:32] triangles. The only couple is not a man
[2:07:35] and a wife.
[2:07:37] friends. Two friends can make a
[2:07:41] couple in the sense that they support
[2:07:44] one another
[2:07:45] emotionally and spiritually. It's all
[2:07:48] right to have a good friend. It's all
[2:07:51] right to think of all of your friends as
[2:07:53] best
[2:07:55] friends. Or none of them as best
[2:08:00] friends. I don't think you heard me.
[2:08:04] It's okay if you want to call every one
[2:08:06] of your friends best friends, but be
[2:08:09] careful
[2:08:14] about calling
[2:08:16] everybody your best friend. Be careful
[2:08:19] about
[2:08:19] that. But also be careful about using
[2:08:23] the term best friend to exclude
[2:08:29] someone else. Well, what am I? Chopped
[2:08:31] liver.
[2:08:34] This happens. Happens in every
[2:08:37] group. Happens
[2:08:39] here. Happens in every
[2:08:42] church. I would just like to have
[2:08:44] everybody as a best friend for whatever
[2:08:46] that
[2:08:47] means rather than to
[2:08:51] constantly tell who my best friend is or
[2:08:55] post who my best friend is. Just have a
[2:08:58] lot of besties. Right. Of course, Estie
[2:09:01] is my bestie, but you know what I mean.
[2:09:04] Have as many as you can. And don't use
[2:09:07] your relationship with one friend to
[2:09:10] belittle.
[2:09:12] Stay out of the triangle.
[2:09:15] Have more in your life than that. Did
[2:09:19] you follow me? Amen. Bowen therefore
[2:09:21] theorized that under stress couples
[2:09:24] gravitate toward third parties to create
[2:09:29] triangles with two of the members always
[2:09:32] being closest. Although which two are in
[2:09:35] and which member is out may be
[2:09:43] constantly. It is
[2:09:46] good because it's
[2:09:48] life and we see it happening around
[2:09:52] us. And if you're depending on your
[2:09:56] triangle for value,
[2:10:02] you're going to greatly
[2:10:04] suffer when you end up being
[2:10:07] occasionally the odd man out.
[2:10:11] I know you're saying right. Are you
[2:10:13] hearing what I'm saying?
[2:10:16] Nobody wants to be the odd man out. But
[2:10:19] if we could all think of each other as
[2:10:22] true
[2:10:23] blue,
[2:10:25] bloodbought
[2:10:27] believers, friends, brothers, sisters.
[2:10:31] That's why I won't reject those titles,
[2:10:34] brother, sister. It's important to
[2:10:37] remember that you and I may not share
[2:10:39] the last name, but there's a bond that
[2:10:43] makes us closer in spiritual terms than
[2:10:47] if we wore the same last name. You
[2:10:50] understand?
[2:10:52] Our validation and our value is it
[2:10:55] shouldn't be found in community only. It
[2:10:57] should be found in the reality of who we
[2:10:59] are because of who he is. Amen. Amen. We
[2:11:04] we shouldn't need someone to constantly
[2:11:06] tell us how amazing we are. Our truth is
[2:11:09] what God says about us because remember
[2:11:12] they can be
[2:11:14] crying hosana.
[2:11:16] Blessed is he who comes in the name of
[2:11:18] the Lord one weekend and the next
[2:11:21] weekend they can be crying crucify him.
[2:11:24] Amen.
[2:11:25] Same friends.
[2:11:29] Woo. Hugging your neck one week and
[2:11:32] giving you the betrayal kiss
[2:11:35] the next week. Don't have to have
[2:11:39] somebody else to go on for him. Build as
[2:11:43] many relationships as you possibly can.
[2:11:46] And don't be the kind of person if you
[2:11:48] can't control the relationship, you
[2:11:50] sabotage it.
[2:11:55] Find your place. Realize there's give
[2:11:58] and take among friends just like there's
[2:12:00] give and take among couples, husbands
[2:12:04] and wives. My that's good.
[2:12:08] In family triangulation system, the
[2:12:10] third person can either be used as a
[2:12:12] substitute for direct communication or
[2:12:15] can be used as a messenger to carry the
[2:12:18] communication to the main party. This
[2:12:21] causes more problems in families nearly
[2:12:24] than anything I know of. Using a a
[2:12:27] child, a teenager, even an adult son or
[2:12:31] daughter, as a third party of a conflict
[2:12:35] between mom and dad, husband and
[2:12:38] wife, can you tell your
[2:12:41] mother, can you tell your father for
[2:12:45] me? It's not
[2:12:48] right to need our children to be on one
[2:12:53] side or the other.
[2:12:55] How many sides are there supposed to be
[2:12:57] in a family in a
[2:12:59] marriage? One side. I see it so often
[2:13:04] whispering going on about the party
[2:13:07] who's not
[2:13:09] there, the dad not there. So the the
[2:13:13] mother and the children communicate vice
[2:13:15] versa. Mom, not there. Listen folks,
[2:13:18] that doesn't build
[2:13:20] strength. Triangulating, bringing other
[2:13:23] people in on your conflict, on your
[2:13:25] hurt, on your wound. It may feel good at
[2:13:28] the
[2:13:29] moment. It may be a temporary uh high,
[2:13:33] but in reality, it it just breeds
[2:13:37] confusion.
[2:13:39] Usually, this communication is an
[2:13:41] express dissatisfaction with the main
[2:13:43] party. your
[2:13:50] mother. It's quiet.
[2:13:54] The reason that this occurs is that both
[2:13:56] parties are
[2:13:57] dysfunctional. Let's say amen that
[2:14:00] rather than communicating directly with
[2:14:02] each other, they utilize a third party.
[2:14:05] Sometimes this is because it's unsafe to
[2:14:07] go directly to the person and discuss
[2:14:09] the concerns, particularly if they are
[2:14:11] alcoholic and or abusive. There are
[2:14:15] times that a mediator is necessary for
[2:14:18] the safety of those involved. That's not
[2:14:21] what we're talking about today. Are you
[2:14:24] with me?
[2:14:26] Now, this is how this kind of
[2:14:28] triangulation works. It pulls in third
[2:14:31] parties to gain emotional
[2:14:35] leverage, sympathy, or support in a
[2:14:40] conflict. Sometimes a wife will get her
[2:14:43] mother
[2:14:44] involved with a problem she has with her
[2:14:49] husband.
[2:14:50] Bad, bad idea.
[2:14:56] because he's going to bring you a
[2:14:58] flower.
[2:15:01] You're going to forgive him. Yeah.
[2:15:04] You're going to lay down beside him that
[2:15:06] night, peck him on the
[2:15:09] jaw, and you're going to go on.
[2:15:13] Mother,
[2:15:18] however, she's going to
[2:15:20] boil. I knew he was sorry.
[2:15:24] I warned my
[2:15:25] daughter. I knew he wasn't worth having.
[2:15:29] I knew he come from the wrong kind of
[2:15:32] family. She's going to
[2:15:35] stew. There are times when it's
[2:15:38] important to leave our our our parents
[2:15:41] out.
[2:15:45] Because we can forget, forgive, love on.
[2:15:49] They can't always do that. Right. Hello.
[2:15:53] We can say dad. We can change this thing
[2:15:55] around in so many different ways. I'm
[2:15:57] hoping that you're getting the point.
[2:15:59] Siblings the same way. You can call
[2:16:01] sister on her blood sister, brother.
[2:16:04] Complain about the companion. And you go
[2:16:07] on forgive, forget, and build on and
[2:16:09] love on, move on. And and at
[2:16:11] Thanksgiving,
[2:16:15] all of a sudden the dirt comes out. and
[2:16:19] you're wondering why your
[2:16:20] brother-in-law, why your sister-in-law
[2:16:22] has such a problem with you.
[2:16:24] You can't imagine why. And it's because
[2:16:27] your
[2:16:28] honey has been flapping this trap
[2:16:32] or she's been complaining to other
[2:16:35] members of her family. It's hard to
[2:16:39] forgive when you've already got a little
[2:16:41] wound in there. Amen. Triangulation is
[2:16:45] not generally a good idea.
[2:16:48] It pulls in third parties to gain
[2:16:50] emotional leverage, sympathy, or support
[2:16:52] in a conflict. It's about building an
[2:16:56] alliance, swaying
[2:16:58] perception, and cornering the other
[2:17:01] person with
[2:17:04] opinions,
[2:17:05] sympathy, or
[2:17:07] shame. It turns personal
[2:17:11] conflict into
[2:17:13] public spectacle.
[2:17:16] It's not a good idea. Let me give you
[2:17:20] some examples of what it sounds like in
[2:17:24] phraseology. Other people agree with
[2:17:26] [Music]
[2:17:29] me. You know, that's a nicer way of
[2:17:32] saying you're so dumb. You don't see the
[2:17:36] truth. But brother Shelly does.
[2:17:43] Your children see it.
[2:17:46] Your neighbor sees it. Your coworker see
[2:17:49] it. Your boss sees it. Hello. Are you
[2:17:54] hearing
[2:17:55] me? Even so and so noticed what you
[2:17:58] did. I saw the way they were looking at
[2:18:01] you when you acted like that and said
[2:18:04] that stupid thing you said. I'm sure
[2:18:07] that others feel the same way about you.
[2:18:10] It's not just me.
[2:18:13] There are plenty of
[2:18:15] others. People are saying that you were
[2:18:18] the one that was
[2:18:19] wrong. Now you're telling me I'm the one
[2:18:21] that's wrong, but I've been
[2:18:23] hearing that others are say, "Well,
[2:18:26] who?" Well, you know, sister so and so,
[2:18:30] brother so and so. Hello.
[2:18:34] You know what? There are certain times
[2:18:36] that I don't care how quiet it
[2:18:40] gets as long as you're
[2:18:42] listening. Other times I really need
[2:18:44] your loudness. This is one of those
[2:18:47] times where it just be all right if you
[2:18:49] had to scream, "Oh me." Because the
[2:18:51] reality is we could just about all say,
[2:18:53] "Oh me." Because we've done this in the
[2:18:57] heat of a moment to feel better about
[2:18:59] our side. But remember, this isn't the
[2:19:03] north against the south.
[2:19:05] This is a passing disagreement.
[2:19:10] Tomorrow it may not matter. One phone
[2:19:12] call could shift the whole atmosphere
[2:19:15] and it wouldn't matter. You get a phone
[2:19:17] call, your son has been killed in a in
[2:19:21] an accident doing a sport that he
[2:19:24] enjoyed doing so much. and and the
[2:19:28] problem that you have with your wife,
[2:19:30] the problem you have with your husband,
[2:19:32] the problem you have with your parent in
[2:19:34] that moment, it means nothing because
[2:19:37] now you're all focusing on tragedy and
[2:19:40] loss and common pain. Come on. These
[2:19:43] things don't need to go over into the
[2:19:46] next day. We need to leave them where
[2:19:48] they are. God wants us to be clean of
[2:19:51] all
[2:19:52] manipulation, not controlling one
[2:19:54] another. Uh the last one I just think
[2:19:57] it's
[2:19:58] interesting that even so and so you know
[2:20:01] how dense so and so is they never notice
[2:20:04] anything but even they noticed how you
[2:20:06] were treating me. Even they noticed what
[2:20:08] you were saying to me. Even they noticed
[2:20:11] how you peeled out of the parking
[2:20:13] lot. It creates a false consensus to add
[2:20:17] weight to the manipulator's position. I
[2:20:19] have to tell people all the time, please
[2:20:21] don't quote me.
[2:20:24] It's not because I'm ashamed of what
[2:20:26] I've said. Not usually. It's simply
[2:20:29] because why build to someone's
[2:20:31] resentment? Why feed someone's
[2:20:33] resentment that they already may have
[2:20:35] toward a leader? Some people just have
[2:20:38] leader problems. Some people just have
[2:20:40] authority issues. And you go tell them,
[2:20:43] "I agree with you." And they don't just
[2:20:46] hear that I agree with you. They hear
[2:20:48] that I'm mad at them.
[2:20:51] And then I have to try to minister to
[2:20:53] that kind of a person. So
[2:20:56] triangulation using me and your family
[2:21:01] arguments is not the best idea.
[2:21:05] When your teenager is doing something
[2:21:07] you don't think they ought to do, you
[2:21:09] establish your rules.
[2:21:12] use me
[2:21:14] sparingly because if they totally resent
[2:21:18] my stand, I won't be able to teach them
[2:21:21] anything. They'll sit consumed with
[2:21:23] their own bitterness. The saint said,
[2:21:25] "Amen." What causes this kind of what?
[2:21:29] No. What does this kind of behavior
[2:21:30] cause? Division in the body, division in
[2:21:33] the family. It sws division and
[2:21:38] suspicion, creating
[2:21:40] sides. Read the rest out loud. Where
[2:21:44] none should exist? Gossip, disguise,
[2:21:48] oh, as concern.
[2:21:54] Have you Have you ever seen the
[2:21:56] disappointed look on certain people's
[2:21:57] face when you tell them, "Well, I didn't
[2:21:59] ask." What?
[2:22:03] You didn't ask. What do you mean you
[2:22:06] didn't ask? I want to know.
[2:22:11] You know what you can tell them? Then
[2:22:13] you ask.
[2:22:16] It obviously didn't mean as much to me
[2:22:18] as it does to you. You've got a
[2:22:21] smartphone. Text them. Ask them. Find
[2:22:24] out. Hello.
[2:22:27] Emotional ganging up instead of
[2:22:30] reconciliation undermines healthy
[2:22:32] relationships through gossip and back
[2:22:34] channel influence. I've participated in
[2:22:37] this before. I'm ashamed that I have.
[2:22:40] I've repented that I have. And I want
[2:22:43] you to be able to recognize if you also
[2:22:46] need to say, "Lord, help me." A false
[2:22:50] witness that turns hearts away from
[2:22:52] truth and unity. That's what this kind
[2:22:54] of triangulation does. It fuels conflict
[2:22:57] like wood feeds a fire. When the
[2:22:59] tailbearer, the one spreading info to a
[2:23:03] third party, stops, the conflict dies.
[2:23:07] If you quit passing the stuff around,
[2:23:12] what it does spiritually, it creates
[2:23:15] alliances, some of which are truly
[2:23:18] unholy alliances, rather than addressing
[2:23:22] and resolving problems. Triangulation
[2:23:25] seeks
[2:23:27] control and through
[2:23:30] numbers and
[2:23:32] sympathy. Everything is not a
[2:23:35] democracy. Everything is not a vote. Are
[2:23:38] you with me?
[2:23:41] Proverbs
[2:23:43] 16:28. We've used this before. A fro man
[2:23:47] seth strife and a whisperer separateth
[2:23:52] chief friends. Leave others out of your
[2:23:55] conflict if you possibly can.
[2:24:00] You do have a spiritual leader. If you
[2:24:03] need
[2:24:04] help, wear him
[2:24:06] out. But don't pull other believers
[2:24:11] in. It's dangerous.
[2:24:14] in Matthew chap
[2:24:18] 18 15- 17 and and and
[2:24:24] I'm not too far from being done with
[2:24:28] this
[2:24:31] portion. Moreover, if thy brother shall
[2:24:34] trespass against thee, go and tell him
[2:24:36] his fault between thee and him alone. If
[2:24:39] he shall hear thee, just the two of you,
[2:24:42] you've gained your brother.
[2:24:45] Sometimes that doesn't turn out the way
[2:24:47] we want it to turn out, does it? It
[2:24:49] becomes all guns on us. But if he will
[2:24:53] not hear you, then take with thee one or
[2:24:55] two more, that in the mouth of two or
[2:24:57] three witnesses, every word may be
[2:25:02] established. This is Jesus. This is red
[2:25:04] letter. He's not encouraging us to
[2:25:06] triangulate.
[2:25:08] He's encouraging us to try to bring a
[2:25:11] resolution to the situation. And if he
[2:25:15] shall neglect to hear them tell it unto
[2:25:17] the church, and of course you, you know,
[2:25:21] can't just stand up and oh
[2:25:26] my, how many of you were
[2:25:28] here some years ago when a dear
[2:25:31] struggling person many years ago,
[2:25:33] Hallelujah, before I was married, praise
[2:25:36] the Lord.
[2:25:38] when a dear struggling sister stood up
[2:25:41] in the middle of a service and
[2:25:43] screamed at the top of her lungs, "I'm
[2:25:46] in love with Brother
[2:25:50] Shelley." There was only one problem
[2:25:52] with that. Her husband was sitting next
[2:25:55] to her on the
[2:25:59] pew. This is not the way to handle those
[2:26:02] kinds of things. I was never more
[2:26:05] unaware. I now knew something that I
[2:26:07] didn't know. And that gave me great
[2:26:10] wisdom to stay away as far away as I
[2:26:14] possibly could. I've been where these
[2:26:16] confession services were going on where
[2:26:19] people were standing up and telling on
[2:26:21] one another. I don't think that's what
[2:26:23] Jesus was talking
[2:26:27] about. I think he was telling us it's
[2:26:29] better not to take these things into our
[2:26:31] own hands. There's a right and a wrong
[2:26:33] way to do it. If he shall neglect to
[2:26:36] hear them, tell it unto the church. But
[2:26:37] if he neglect to hear the church, let
[2:26:39] him be unto thee as a heathen man and a
[2:26:42] publican. He's no longer your brother if
[2:26:45] he can't take
[2:26:46] correction. The Amplified says it like
[2:26:48] this. If your brother wrongs you, go and
[2:26:51] show him his fault between you and him
[2:26:55] privately, not telling someone else
[2:26:57] first. If he listens to you, you've won
[2:27:00] back your brother. But if he does not
[2:27:02] listen, take along with you one or two
[2:27:04] others so that they so that every word
[2:27:07] may be confirmed. And really that's not
[2:27:08] supposed to be just people who agree
[2:27:10] with you. It should sort of be nonbiased
[2:27:13] folk. Wouldn't you agree? So that every
[2:27:16] word may be confirmed and upheld by the
[2:27:18] testimony of two or three witnesses. If
[2:27:20] he pays no attention to them, refusing
[2:27:22] to listen and obey, then you tell it to
[2:27:24] the church. And if he refuses to listen
[2:27:26] even to the church, let him be to you as
[2:27:28] a
[2:27:29] pagan and a tax
[2:27:31] collector. And we all know what we think
[2:27:34] about tax collectors.
[2:27:37] Amen. Jesus is teaching direct
[2:27:42] communication as a way of building
[2:27:45] relationships, not third party
[2:27:48] involvement. Triangulation violates this
[2:27:52] by spreading offense.
[2:27:55] hurt, wrong opinion, and it never leads
[2:28:00] to
[2:28:01] reconciliation. How many of you believe
[2:28:03] that the ultimate goal in every godly
[2:28:05] relationship should be reconciliation?
[2:28:08] If at all possible, that would be our
[2:28:10] desire. Are you can you have another
[2:28:12] scripture? James chapter 3, New
[2:28:15] Testament, verses 14- 16. But if you
[2:28:18] have bitter envying and strife in your
[2:28:21] hearts, glory not and lie not against
[2:28:25] the truth. This wisdom descendeth not
[2:28:28] from above, but is earthly and sensual
[2:28:31] and devilish. For where envying and
[2:28:34] strife is, there is confusion and every
[2:28:37] evil work. You need to be aware that
[2:28:40] there are some people who are in their
[2:28:43] dysfunction. They thrive where confusion
[2:28:45] is.
[2:28:48] They starve when there's no problem,
[2:28:50] when there's no
[2:28:51] conflict. You've got to be very careful
[2:28:54] with those kinds of people because not
[2:28:56] only will they be magnetized to a
[2:28:59] situation where confusion is, when there
[2:29:01] is none, they have a tendency to create
[2:29:04] it.
[2:29:07] That's not the kind of person you want
[2:29:09] to put on your party list.
[2:29:14] I'm being honest.
[2:29:16] That's not the kind of person that you
[2:29:18] want to go out of your way to include in
[2:29:20] your everyday life. And some of us can't
[2:29:23] do much about it because we're related
[2:29:25] to them. So, we have to use a lot of
[2:29:27] wisdom and we have to be careful what we
[2:29:29] tell them, what we say in front of
[2:29:32] them because you may think you're
[2:29:34] sharing something in quiet confidence
[2:29:37] and you may find out that it's about to
[2:29:39] make the morning
[2:29:40] newspaper because some people need
[2:29:44] that. I know of some situations as I
[2:29:47] mentioned earlier where wives have said
[2:29:50] some things to their mothers, to their
[2:29:52] parents about their
[2:29:55] husband. Things that by the end of the
[2:29:57] day they would have never
[2:30:00] said. Things that by a few hours later
[2:30:03] they would have never said, but they
[2:30:04] will forever
[2:30:07] haunt that mother or that
[2:30:10] father. You want to be careful with that
[2:30:12] kind of support.
[2:30:14] That's not really support. Everybody
[2:30:18] wants their parents to agree with them.
[2:30:20] Amen. But what if it means that you're
[2:30:22] going to twist
[2:30:25] them, influence them against your
[2:30:28] family?
[2:30:30] That's not a good idea. In the Amplified
[2:30:32] it says, "But if you have bitter
[2:30:34] jealousy, envy, contention, rivalry,
[2:30:36] selfish ambition in your hearts, do not
[2:30:39] pride yourselves on it, and thus be in
[2:30:41] defiance of and false to the truth."
[2:30:45] This superficial wisdom is not such as
[2:30:48] comes down from above, but is earthly,
[2:30:51] unspiritual, animal. It's beastlike,
[2:30:54] even devilish, demoniacal. That's pretty
[2:30:58] serious. For wherever there is jealousy,
[2:31:01] envy and contention, rivalry, and
[2:31:04] selfish ambition, there will also be
[2:31:06] what? Confusion, unrest, disharmony,
[2:31:11] rebellion. I believe there's people in
[2:31:13] here who can relate to this. And all
[2:31:16] sorts of evil and vile practices.
[2:31:19] Triangulation creates strife and
[2:31:22] confusion, opening the door for every
[2:31:24] other evil work. A powerful tie-in to
[2:31:27] manipulation.
[2:31:29] and
[2:31:29] witchcraft. Proverbs 11:13, "A
[2:31:33] tailbearer revealth secrets, but he that
[2:31:36] is of a faithful
[2:31:42] spirit." Now, some people think that's
[2:31:44] what they're
[2:31:46] doing when they live in
[2:31:53] secrecy. I don't want to do that. I
[2:31:56] don't want to do that on purpose. I
[2:31:57] don't want to build that kind of
[2:31:58] curiosity in somebody. I did that this
[2:32:01] week and I I didn't mean to. I didn't
[2:32:03] know I was I really didn't think
[2:32:04] anything about it. But I had made the
[2:32:07] statement, I have a baptism. I'm going
[2:32:08] to be baptizing someone in a certain
[2:32:10] time. Now, there are times that things
[2:32:12] are confidential and they're none of our
[2:32:15] business. But but I didn't mean that I
[2:32:18] was trying to hold that information and
[2:32:20] somebody said, "Is it okay for me to
[2:32:22] ask? Is is that a a private thing?" No,
[2:32:26] it it it's not. I didn't mean to to not
[2:32:29] I wasn't trying to conceal something. I
[2:32:33] was just making a point. I'd be busy at
[2:32:35] a certain
[2:32:36] time. Sometimes we
[2:32:39] create sort of a
[2:32:44] mistrust by how we handle a
[2:32:47] situation and we do it on
[2:32:50] purpose. Many times there are some
[2:32:54] people who want to tell you so bad they
[2:32:56] can taste
[2:32:57] it, but they want you to
[2:33:01] ask, "Oh, get out of my head,
[2:33:09] names." They want you to ask. They'll
[2:33:12] say things like this. "We're we're
[2:33:14] having we're having company for dinner
[2:33:17] Friday. We're having company for dinner
[2:33:19] Wednesday. We're going out of town with
[2:33:22] some with some folks uh o over over the
[2:33:25] weekend. Some ju just just some
[2:33:31] folks. You have a decision to
[2:33:34] make. How much do you
[2:33:39] care? Well, I have to tell you this. The
[2:33:42] way you said it makes me care. I didn't
[2:33:44] care.
[2:33:45] It didn't matter to me till you dangled
[2:33:48] it like a carrot in my face. You
[2:33:50] manipulator.
[2:33:53] Oh, somebody's hearing me now.
[2:33:56] You you you you could have just said,
[2:33:58] "I'm having the Hodgeges
[2:33:59] over." I like the Hodgeges. I think it's
[2:34:03] a good idea for you to have them
[2:34:05] over. I don't think it has to be a
[2:34:08] secret.
[2:34:09] If you think my feelings are hurt
[2:34:11] because you had them and didn't have me,
[2:34:13] you are so wrong. I like my
[2:34:19] chair. I love fellowship. But I like my
[2:34:22] home. I like my
[2:34:24] chair. I' I've realized I'm a grown man.
[2:34:26] I don't have to go because the family
[2:34:28] goes somewhere. I can stay home in the
[2:34:31] quiet. We had some extra kids this week
[2:34:34] and they were they were lovely kids, but
[2:34:37] I couldn't hardly
[2:34:39] wait for just a few hours in my chair.
[2:34:43] Nobody.
[2:34:45] You understand?
[2:34:48] Don't Do you know that's stirring? Did
[2:34:50] you know that's stirring
[2:34:52] something? If it's a secret, keep it a
[2:34:55] secret. Don't mention it. Amen.
[2:34:58] If it needs to be a secret, if there's
[2:35:00] some reason why you're going to be uh,
[2:35:03] you know, endangering national security
[2:35:06] to tell me who's eating with you, don't
[2:35:08] tell me. I don't want to know. I don't
[2:35:11] want the Russians to find
[2:35:20] out. Well, if you fire me, I'm going to
[2:35:23] look for another job.
[2:35:26] Folks, do that. Bait you, lead
[2:35:29] you, make up your mind. You're going to
[2:35:32] quit feeding folk like that. Don't even
[2:35:36] ask. You know what'll happen? Before
[2:35:39] long, they'll start telling you
[2:35:41] everything. Once they find out, you
[2:35:43] you're not even going to bother to ask.
[2:35:46] Folks, this that's kind of like
[2:35:48] children's play, isn't it?
[2:35:51] You see, a faithful person protects the
[2:35:53] integrity of direct communication. A
[2:35:57] triangulator spreads private matters to
[2:36:00] gain
[2:36:01] advantage or personal
[2:36:03] affirmation. Lord, help
[2:36:11] us. Sometimes we make a big tod do where
[2:36:13] there's no big to-d do. Psalm 1015. I'm
[2:36:17] nearly done. Who? You. You already said
[2:36:19] that. I am. I meant it both times. Who
[2:36:22] so privilege slandereth his neighbor,
[2:36:25] him will
[2:36:29] I? Him that hath a high look and a proud
[2:36:33] heart will not I
[2:36:35] suffer. I got to know what that means.
[2:36:39] So I go to the amplified. It says, "Who
[2:36:41] so privvily slandereth his neighbor, him
[2:36:43] will I cut off from me. He who has a
[2:36:47] hotty look and a proud and arrogant
[2:36:48] heart, I cannot and I will
[2:36:52] not
[2:36:54] tolerate. God takes triangulation
[2:36:57] seriously, especially when it involves
[2:37:00] slander behind closed doors. It's not
[2:37:03] harmless. It brings judgment. It brings
[2:37:06] confusion. Jesus taught us to
[2:37:08] communicate privately uh first.
[2:37:12] Unity is preserved when we deal face to
[2:37:14] face, not running it through somebody
[2:37:17] else. Look people in the eye. Here's
[2:37:20] what you've done. How can we move past
[2:37:24] this? I honestly know people who will
[2:37:28] constantly have this kind of attitude.
[2:37:30] Well, if he wants to know what I'm mad
[2:37:32] about, he'll contact
[2:37:34] me. Well, he will if he goes to the
[2:37:37] altar and it troubles him. But what if
[2:37:40] he goes to the altar and it doesn't
[2:37:42] trouble him?
[2:37:45] You see, there's a point that never gets
[2:37:47] mentioned in that scripture.
[2:37:50] It says the scripture said, "If you
[2:37:52] remember that your brother has an aw."
[2:37:54] Well, I want you to understand that if
[2:37:56] that doesn't come into your
[2:37:58] heart, you won't remember it. Not in
[2:38:01] that moment. And that remembering is God
[2:38:05] reminding you there's some trouble there
[2:38:08] that you need to make right before you
[2:38:10] talk to me about your needs.
[2:38:14] Jesus taught us a false witness.
[2:38:16] Proverbs 6:19, "A false witness that
[2:38:18] speaketh lies and he that sweth discord
[2:38:20] among the brethren." These are some of
[2:38:22] the things that God hates. Oh, I see the
[2:38:26] end. And there's some biblical examples
[2:38:28] that would take too long to talk about
[2:38:30] this evening, but I have a lot to say
[2:38:33] when we get to the next and and maybe
[2:38:36] Tuesday night we'll start that or next
[2:38:37] weekend. But it's from the story of Ahab
[2:38:41] and Jezebel and Neabboth. And there's so
[2:38:44] much going on in that story. Do you
[2:38:47] remember Nabboth just finally has to say
[2:38:50] it's not for sale. I know who you are. I
[2:38:53] know you're the king. I know you're the
[2:38:55] boss man, but I'm not selling my family
[2:38:58] land. Cost him his life, but he died
[2:39:01] with integrity, without compromise. He
[2:39:03] died courageously.
[2:39:06] While Jezebel continued to control and
[2:39:09] manipulate both her husband and the
[2:39:12] kingdom, but she had an end coming.
[2:39:17] So hold on for that. But in the story of
[2:39:20] N in Numbers 16, we won't go there, but
[2:39:23] there's a story of a triangulation
[2:39:25] between Kora, Dayan, and
[2:39:27] Abram, they didn't confront Moses
[2:39:30] because they challenged his leadership.
[2:39:32] They rallied
[2:39:34] 250 leaders to form a
[2:39:37] rebellion. This is manipulation through
[2:39:40] triangulation, through numbers and
[2:39:42] alliances, trying to overthrow righteous
[2:39:45] authority by stacking opinions against
[2:39:47] the truth.
[2:39:49] And it
[2:39:50] worked until it didn't.
[2:39:54] God said, "I'm going to deal with that
[2:39:55] kind of involvement. I'm going to deal
[2:39:57] with that." Didn't he do it? If I
[2:40:00] remember correctly, in one particular
[2:40:02] situation, the earth opens up.
[2:40:05] Triangulation doesn't bring
[2:40:08] resolution. It only reinforces the
[2:40:12] offense. I tell you what we ought to do.
[2:40:15] We ought to triangulate. musicians are
[2:40:18] coming. We ought to triangulate one
[2:40:20] another to try to fix things.
[2:40:23] We ought to pull together alliances to
[2:40:26] make things better instead of adding
[2:40:28] more
[2:40:30] fire, more wood to the fire. Let the
[2:40:34] saints say, "Amen." You may stand. I
[2:40:36] didn't come to hear relationship advice.
[2:40:39] Well, we needed it.
[2:40:42] Lord, I want this church to be so
[2:40:45] strong. You know, Brother Brandon was
[2:40:48] talking about those stones in the
[2:40:51] pyramid. These mysterious
[2:40:56] stones stacked so
[2:40:59] tall. Everybody who examines them says,
[2:41:03] "There's no way in the world this could
[2:41:05] be built with the technology of the
[2:41:07] day."
[2:41:10] Well, we understand that there was some
[2:41:11] supernatural help involved that got
[2:41:14] those stones, heavy, heavy stones up to
[2:41:17] the top of that pyramid. It was more
[2:41:19] than a pulley system like we learned in
[2:41:21] in school. There were some supernatural
[2:41:25] uh helps that got those heavy stones
[2:41:29] uh elevated. I almost said levitated.
[2:41:33] Elevated to that high position. And
[2:41:36] brother Brandham said, "There are places
[2:41:38] in that pyramid that those stones are so
[2:41:42] close
[2:41:43] together that you couldn't put a razor
[2:41:46] blade between
[2:41:50] them." Wonder if there are any husbands
[2:41:52] in this house that would like to have
[2:41:55] that kind of relationship with your
[2:41:58] wife that not even a razor blade could
[2:42:01] come between you.
[2:42:08] Maybe you think that's
[2:42:10] hopeless. I
[2:42:12] don't I don't think
[2:42:14] so. Wouldn't you love to have that kind
[2:42:16] of relationship with your brothers and
[2:42:18] sisters in Christ so that not even a
[2:42:20] razor blade could come between you? You
[2:42:22] just trust one another. You
[2:42:25] realize that they're out for your
[2:42:27] success.
[2:42:28] They want you to
[2:42:30] prosper, particularly in spiritual
[2:42:33] matters. And if you prosper in spiritual
[2:42:36] matters, it releases favor and divine
[2:42:39] grace and and you see success in other
[2:42:42] areas of your life. When Paul was giving
[2:42:45] this amazing advice to his beloved
[2:42:48] friend
[2:42:50] Gaes, he said,
[2:42:52] "Beloved, I wish above all things that
[2:42:56] thou mayest prosper and be in good
[2:42:59] health even as thy soul prospers."
[2:43:06] I want you to prosper in the
[2:43:09] natural, but let that be an overflow of
[2:43:13] spiritual inward
[2:43:15] prosperity that it wouldn't get you off
[2:43:18] track. If you prosper in the natural and
[2:43:21] suffer in the spiritual, you're no
[2:43:22] better off. But if you prosper in the
[2:43:25] spiritual and it overflows into the
[2:43:28] natural, then guess what? God gets the
[2:43:30] praise. Isn't he worthy? Amen. I would
[2:43:34] to God that we could all find that place
[2:43:36] that not a razor blade would come
[2:43:39] between us.
[2:43:41] I also want you to say I want to say to
[2:43:44] you that maybe you I I hope I hope
[2:43:49] you wouldn't ponder on
[2:43:53] this. But the reality is as you examine
[2:43:56] your life, you may find
[2:43:59] that if you had it to do over again, you
[2:44:02] would do
[2:44:03] differently. Well, that's
[2:44:06] wonderful. But you may not have that
[2:44:08] opportunity.
[2:44:11] I've told you before they say the brain
[2:44:13] is still developing at age
[2:44:16] 25 especially in that place of deep
[2:44:20] reasoning the ability to really weigh
[2:44:23] the pros and the cons and they say brain
[2:44:28] scientists say it's not a good idea to
[2:44:31] choose the companion for your life until
[2:44:33] you're at least 25 today that feels like
[2:44:37] an old maid and a bachelor doesn't
[2:44:40] it. But brain science says it's only
[2:44:43] then. And some people are
[2:44:47] obviously handicapped way beyond
[2:44:51] 25. But the reality is they say that if
[2:44:54] you choose your companion before then
[2:44:57] and then your brain fully matures that
[2:45:00] you would likely choose an entirely
[2:45:02] different person kind of
[2:45:05] person. You you can't undo it now.
[2:45:09] You can't change it now. What's done is
[2:45:12] done. So, you should ask the
[2:45:15] Lord to help you save what you have. And
[2:45:20] that's going to be more give than
[2:45:23] take. I don't buy into that marriage
[2:45:26] thought that it's
[2:45:27] 50/50. If you are running a 50/50, then
[2:45:30] that's why you're having so many
[2:45:32] problems. It's 100 100. It's a man
[2:45:35] giving his all, a woman giving his all.
[2:45:38] And I have to admit there's certainly
[2:45:39] been times in our marriage that I didn't
[2:45:41] give uh my whole my
[2:45:44] all. And uh things suffer because of
[2:45:48] that. May God give us the grace to go
[2:45:51] the extra mile. And may we learn from
[2:45:54] others. There are others who can tell us
[2:45:56] a thing or two about what it means not
[2:45:58] to not to give everything you've got.
[2:46:01] It's much better to know that you've
[2:46:03] given all and it still didn't fix the
[2:46:06] issue than to know you didn't continue
[2:46:08] to try. You made the
[2:46:12] vow. I'd like to sort of say you're
[2:46:14] stuck with
[2:46:19] it. Jesus makes the biggest difference
[2:46:22] in a marriage
[2:46:24] if you've got two people in love with
[2:46:25] him.
[2:46:27] And that's something to consider when
[2:46:29] you're choosing
[2:46:30] I I think it's a good idea not only in
[2:46:34] fact I was going to read a quote and I I
[2:46:36] I think it was probably in in the next
[2:46:38] section of this where brother Brennham
[2:46:40] said under no
[2:46:41] circumstances should you choose a
[2:46:43] companion that's not a
[2:46:46] believer and we all say well uh you know
[2:46:49] she's Christian she's Baptist she's
[2:46:51] Methodist she's this well I tell you
[2:46:53] that's good but that's not always enough
[2:46:57] in fact you better try to find somebody
[2:46:59] who is as close to your thoughts about
[2:47:02] faith
[2:47:05] because it's not just the uh sinner's
[2:47:08] prayer. There's a whole lot more to it
[2:47:11] than that. You better know that it's
[2:47:13] someone who can live the faith that you
[2:47:16] feel is important and try to get that
[2:47:18] sorted out in the beginning because it
[2:47:20] sure is hard to unscramble the eggs
[2:47:23] after. friendships the same
[2:47:26] way, families, children the same way.
[2:47:30] God, help us. Lord, we desire in the
[2:47:35] deepest parts of who we are to love you
[2:47:39] more than anything else in this
[2:47:42] life. It's the greatest commandment to
[2:47:44] love the Lord thy God with all of thy
[2:47:47] heart, with all of your strength, with
[2:47:49] all of your might, with everything that
[2:47:52] we are. This is not passive love. This
[2:47:55] is an aggressive
[2:47:57] effort, an active effort to love you
[2:48:00] more and more. Just place something
[2:48:03] before we
[2:48:06] finish. It's it's a desire to love you
[2:48:09] more and more
[2:48:12] actively. And then the next greatest
[2:48:15] commandment is to love your
[2:48:18] neighbor. It's easy to say it that way,
[2:48:20] but you didn't finish. As
[2:48:24] yourself. That's unselfish
[2:48:27] love. Father, may you consume
[2:48:30] us with unselfish love one toward
[2:48:33] another.
[2:48:36] May we be busier building strong
[2:48:39] Christian friendships and holy
[2:48:42] alliances, times of prayer and
[2:48:45] commitment, reading and studying
[2:48:49] together, Bible
[2:48:51] study more
[2:48:53] than building
[2:48:56] triangulated situations that cause
[2:48:58] greater confusion and and hurt.
[2:49:02] Lord, we want to bring to you again
[2:49:04] today our wounds, our
[2:49:06] offenses, our emotions, and we want to
[2:49:09] say, Jesus, pour your love on them. Pour
[2:49:11] your oil on them. Heal us, Lord, where
[2:49:14] we need to be
[2:49:16] healed. Make us whole in areas where we
[2:49:20] lack. And as we often pray, bind us
[2:49:23] together as a body. You see, stronger
[2:49:27] marriages build stronger
[2:49:29] relationships in churches. If families
[2:49:33] get
[2:49:35] healthier, then the overall environment
[2:49:38] of the community, the church, the faith
[2:49:41] community, it becomes stronger and
[2:49:44] healthier because we bring our health
[2:49:46] with us. Just like in times past, we've
[2:49:49] brought our dysfunction with us. This
[2:49:52] would feel hopeless if we had to do it
[2:49:55] on our own. But because of you, Lord, we
[2:49:59] just agree with your word and we say,
[2:50:01] "Teach us, help us, inspire us,
[2:50:04] strengthen us, give us courage to do
[2:50:07] what your word has said." We yield. We
[2:50:09] yield to you. We yield our
[2:50:13] will. We l we yield our right to
[2:50:21] quit. You didn't call us to be quitters.
[2:50:25] You called us to endure to the end. The
[2:50:28] same that endureth to the end shall be
[2:50:30] saved. Lord, may we not quit so quickly
[2:50:33] on our
[2:50:35] relationships. May we put in the extra
[2:50:39] effort and watch the healing
[2:50:43] bomb of the Holy Ghost come and
[2:50:45] [Music]
[2:50:49] soothe. Why don't you just let some
[2:50:51] things drop to your feet tonight this
[2:50:54] afternoon? Why don't you just let some
[2:50:57] things drop right out right down to your
[2:50:59] feet and step over them on your way
[2:51:02] home? Things that you don't want to
[2:51:04] carry anymore. Resentment towards
[2:51:06] someone else. You're legitimate
[2:51:10] hurt. You've been legitimately
[2:51:13] wounded. But you can choose today to
[2:51:17] accept his healing.
[2:51:22] It's been a heavy
[2:51:24] weight, but remember he said, "Casting
[2:51:27] all of your cares on
[2:51:29] me, I care for you." Why don't we come
[2:51:33] and give him some of these burdens as we
[2:51:36] worship him who is worthy. He's worthy.
[2:51:39] If you believe that, say amen. He's
[2:51:42] worthy. He's
[2:51:45] worthy. Jesus is worthy. Hallelujah.
[2:51:48] Hallelujah. He became
[2:51:51] sin who knew no
[2:51:55] sin that we might
[2:51:59] become his
[2:52:02] rightuousness. He humbled himself
[2:52:07] and carried the cross.
[2:52:13] Love so
[2:52:14] [Music]
[2:52:19] amazing. Love so
[2:52:26] amazing. Jesus
[2:52:32] Messiah name above
[2:52:35] all
[2:52:38] names. Thank you. The blessed
[2:52:45] redeemer. You are Emmanuel.
[2:52:51] [Music]
[2:52:52] Yes. The rescue for
[2:52:59] sinners, the ransom from heaven.
[2:53:03] [Music]
[2:53:07] Oh Jesus, Messiah.
[2:53:12] He's the Lord of all. The Lord of all.
[2:53:19] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. His
[2:53:23] body the bread,
[2:53:26] his blood the
[2:53:29] wine broken and poured out. All for
[2:53:35] love. The whole earth
[2:53:39] trembled and the veil was
[2:53:44] torn. Love so
[2:53:46] [Music]
[2:53:50] amazing. God, your love so amazing.
[2:53:59] Jesus the

[2:57:19] sister. So take me by the
[2:57:23] hand. Together we will work till he
[2:57:28] comes.
[2:57:31] Oh, there's no foe that can defeat us.
[2:57:35] We will walk by. Oh, as long as there is
[2:57:41] love, we will stand. Does anybody want
[2:57:45] to do that? You're my brother, you're my
[2:57:49] sister. So take me by the hand. And
[2:57:55] together we will work until he
[2:58:00] comes. There's no foe that can defeat
[2:58:04] us. When we're walking side by
[2:58:08] side, as long as there is love, we will

[2:58:29] [Music]

[2:59:22] hand. Together we will work until he

[2:59:44] You're my brother, you're my sister. So
[2:59:49] take me by the
[2:59:52] hand. Together we will work until he
[2:59:58] comes. There's no foe that can defeat
[3:00:02] us. When we're walking side by side,

[3:00:13] Yes, you are. You're my brother. You're
[3:00:16] my sister.
[3:00:19] So take me by the hand. Stand together
[3:00:22] in Jesus name. Together we will work
[3:00:25] until he comes.
[3:00:29] There's no foe that can defeat us when
[3:00:33] we're walking side by
[3:00:36] side. As long as there is love, we will
[3:00:41] stand.
[3:00:44] How many of you believe that together in
[3:00:47] faith we can do it? We can stand until
[3:00:50] he
[3:00:54] comes. I think if we say this
[3:00:57] generically enough, you would be able to
[3:01:01] respond because we all probably
[3:01:04] somewhere in our life we have a
[3:01:06] relationship that we would like to see
[3:01:08] some healing in. And so just if you see
[3:01:11] somebody's hand go up, please don't zero
[3:01:13] in and think she's mad at her
[3:01:17] husband. She may be I can't can't uh
[3:01:21] confirm or deny. But that's not the only
[3:01:25] relationship they have. Right? If you're
[3:01:29] here and you say, "I have a
[3:01:30] relationship." Maybe you and your
[3:01:32] doctor, you know, I don't know, but I
[3:01:34] have a relationship in my life that I'd
[3:01:36] like to see some healing in. Would you
[3:01:38] just put up your hand? You don't have to
[3:01:41] tell anybody who it is, but I have a
[3:01:43] relationship. I'd like to see some.
[3:01:45] Let's agree together. Father, in the
[3:01:47] name of
[3:01:48] Jesus, it can't be that we are such odd
[3:01:53] and strange people that we can't
[3:01:56] maintain relationships.
[3:01:59] It must be that the enemy works
[3:02:02] overtime to hinder and to harass the
[3:02:07] relationships among believers and their
[3:02:09] families and their connections. It seems
[3:02:13] like he delights in driving a wedge
[3:02:16] between people who should be united. So
[3:02:20] Lord, right now, every person who raised
[3:02:24] a hand, every person on the stream who
[3:02:28] said, "I'd like to see some
[3:02:30] relationships strengthened and
[3:02:34] healed." Maybe you'd like for the Lord
[3:02:36] to just paint your
[3:02:38] mind with Calvar's blood, like Rusty
[3:02:42] Goodman wrote so many years ago. Just
[3:02:45] paint my mind with Calvar's blood. Help
[3:02:49] me
[3:02:49] forget. Help me turn loose of some
[3:02:52] things that continue to stand in my way
[3:02:56] of seeing healing in that particular
[3:03:00] relationship. Help me to forgive without
[3:03:02] an apology. Help me Lord to have
[3:03:07] strategy. I read so many little things
[3:03:10] in the scripture. One like a a secret
[3:03:13] gift pacifth anger. that that there are
[3:03:16] so many keys you've given us in the
[3:03:18] scripture to help heal and make whole
[3:03:21] our relationships. We do what we know to
[3:03:23] do as believers. We come to you right
[3:03:25] now. And Lord, I'd like for somebody to
[3:03:28] be able to testify. I watch
[3:03:31] God show
[3:03:33] up in a relationship that I lifted
[3:03:36] before him. I watched healing begin to
[3:03:39] come and peace begin to come. I felt my
[3:03:44] cords strengthened with my own brothers
[3:03:46] and sisters in the family of faith. God,
[3:03:49] we look to you for
[3:03:51] everything. Some people don't understand
[3:03:53] the way we pray about everything. But
[3:03:56] you told us that if it concerns us, it
[3:03:59] concerns you. Oh, that gives me so much
[3:04:02] peace to know it's never too little,
[3:04:06] it's never too big. You care about what
[3:04:09] I care about. Father, come right now.
[3:04:12] May we all find a higher limb to climb
[3:04:15] up to. May we not be satisfied with
[3:04:18] where we are. May we all want to draw a
[3:04:21] little bit closer to you in this hour.
[3:04:23] We give you praise and honor and glory
[3:04:25] for it's in the exalted name of the Lord
[3:04:27] Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. What are the
[3:04:30] dates of the June meeting who knows them
[3:04:33] by heart?
[3:04:35] June 7th and 8th, Saturday night and
[3:04:37] Sunday morning, we'll meet together in
[3:04:39] his name to see what the Lord has. And
[3:04:42] you be preparing your heart because
[3:04:45] we're going to announce sometime in the
[3:04:47] next few weeks uh a time of having
[3:04:49] communion and footwashing together and
[3:04:52] just waiting on the final release of the
[3:04:54] Lord and the right timing to do it. So
[3:04:57] you prepare your heart and pray that
[3:04:59] God's perfect will is done in all
[3:05:01] things. May God do some more gardening
[3:05:04] in us. May he help us to do some more
[3:05:07] weeding ourselves. Be ready for what he
[3:05:09] has. I feel a good spirit here. Good
[3:05:12] presence of the Lord here. Let's go in
[3:05:14] his peace. Let's go trying to lift up
[3:05:17] his name with everything we do and say.
[3:05:20] Amen.
[3:05:22] God bless you. You're dismissed to go in
[3:05:24] the lovely name of the Lord. You're my
[3:05:27] brother. You're my sister. So take me by
[3:05:32] the hand. God bless you. Love
[3:05:36] you. Love you. Come. God bless you.
[3:05:40] Gwen, I love you. No. For that kind of
[3:05:44] VA, is that you? Are you
[3:05:48] excited? Don't hurt yourself. As there
[3:05:51] is love, we will stand. God bless you.
[3:05:56] Let let pap help you. Oh, come on, big
[3:05:58] girl.
[3:06:00] God bless you. I'm gonna pick you up.
[3:06:02] Can I Can I pick you up? Give you a
[3:06:03] little squeeze. I love
[3:06:10] you. There's no fat that can defeat
[3:06:15] us. God bless
[3:06:18] you. And as long as there is love, we
[3:06:23] will stand. Bless his name. You're my
[3:06:27] brother. You're my sister, so take me by
[3:06:32] the
[3:06:33] hand. Oh, together we will work till he
[3:06:40] comes. There's no bold that can defeat
[3:06:44] us. When we're walking side by
[3:06:48] side, and as long as there is love, we
[3:06:53] will stand.
[3:06:56] You're my brother. You're my
[3:07:01] sister. Take me by the
[3:07:04] hand. Together we will work until he
[3:07:11] comes. There's no B that can defeat us.
[3:07:16] And we're walking side by side. Oh, as
[3:07:20] long as there is love, we will stand one
[3:07:25] more time. You're my brother, you're my
[3:07:30] sister. So take me by the
[3:07:33] hand and together we will work until he
[3:07:40] comes. There's no foe that can defeat
[3:07:44] us.
[3:07:45] When we're walking side by side, as long
[3:07:50] as there is love, we will stand.
