Because he was seeking for me, &gt;&gt; my heart was turned to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you have a need on your heart today as we go into prayer? Hands are raised. The Lord sees the needs. Want to pray for those that are traveling in, those who will be traveling out. We want to remember Michael and Crystalin's daughters today, Adelaide and Lydia. They're not well. We want to ask the Lord to minister to them. Remember my granddaughter Edith. She needs a touch from the Lord. Some some of the Yoviches are are not well and need to be remembered to the Lord. And Haj's children are not well. They're coughing and they need to be remembered to the Lord. And sometimes people just are staying home to keep keep things from spreading because they just go so quickly among us. My dear friend, Brother Paul Drowned is facing a a crisis of health and needs to be remembered to the Lord in prayer. &gt;&gt; And for those of you that have not heard, Sister Flo lost her granddaughter Brandy Michelle last night. She had uh fought for quite a while, many years now with her health and uh even uh cancerree and and and whipped so many things. but uh had a little procedure done on on Friday and it didn't go so well. They weren't able to do what they needed to do and something happened. I don't know what it was, but she ended up being uh having sepsis and and they went in for surgery to try to correct the problem and lost her. &gt;&gt; And we want to remember the whole family to the Lord in prayer. all of them. Uh the the siblings uh you know technically we we could say half siblings but people don't close families don't pay no attention to half and step and all of that and I know their hearts are are hurting the whole family. Sister Flo again has lost a loved one. &gt;&gt; God has been so faithful to her. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and they don't know how maybe they don't even know how blessed they've been &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; to have her praying them over safely when I heard I had a great peace that somehow Brandy had made all preparation &gt;&gt; and then I heard later that that she had a [music] you know some intuition some feeling that maybe this would be it this might be the one she didn't come through which sort of confirmed for me that when you're fighting like that, you better stay prayed up and you better better know that you're ready to meet the Lord. And and I believe she I believe we'll see her &gt;&gt; and I believe Sister Flo will see her on the other side of the river. But uh please pray for that family this week. And uh brother Daniel and Sister Anna are leaving after the service today to drive uh for quite a drive to get home to her parents for her uh uncle's funeral. longtime pastor of a little message church there and we'll be seeing family. Let's pray for their safety. And my family's all all but Joshua. He has to work. We're going to we're driving away for three nights. Uh leaving this afternoon as well. We want safety and and uh then your family starts coming in soon. When when do the first ones come? Do you know? &gt;&gt; Start coming in Wednesday, he said. So, let's uh really lift them up to the Lord that everyone will will travel safely and wherever you're going, we're going to have some missing next weekend. May God just be with you. Angels lining the highways. It's a dangerous time. It really is. &gt;&gt; And I I feel sometime burdens to pray for people who are moving about. Uh we're all targets. &gt;&gt; We are. &gt;&gt; But thanks be to God, we're not going anywhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until he's ready for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care how bad the doctor is. I don't care how bad the hospital is. I don't care how bad the surgery is. &gt;&gt; We're not going anywhere until the Lord is ready for us. &gt;&gt; He says it's done. &gt;&gt; I know some people say they believe in the sovereignty of God, but they talk like they don't. I believe it &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; I believe he's sovereign. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I've seen miracle. God can give a miracle. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you got a bad doctor, God can get involved and do and and do it himself. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Anyway, let's believe the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Rest of this service. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh Lord, I love you. Yes, I love you. I love you more today because you care for me [singing] in such a special way. That's why I praise you and I lift you up and I magnify your name. That's why my heart just wants to praise. Oh Lord, I love you. Yes, I love you. I love you more today because you care for me in such a special way. That's why I praise you and I lift you up and I magnify your name. That's why my heart just wants Brother R.J. can I call on you to pray today, please? &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I love you. Yes, I love you. I love you more today because you care for me in such a special way. That's why I praise you and I lift you up and I magnify your name. That's why my heart just wants to pray. Beautiful song. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Lord, we do worship you today. How thankful we are, Father, for your goodness and your faithfulness. We're the apple of your eye, Lord. There's not a thing that can happen on this earth or to your people, to your bride, that you're not intimately aware of. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe it. And I thank you, oh God, that you are a high priest that's touched with the feelings of our infirmities because you walked in flesh among us. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; I was thinking earlier today, Lord, we're a diverse people, but we're unified and that we all share the same lamb. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every one of us today, &gt;&gt; our claim is Yeshua, the lamb of God, slain from the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And so, we're a blessed people, Father. &gt;&gt; We're blessed that you've opened our eyes &gt;&gt; to see and to receive your sonus. Lord, I pray for your people today. &gt;&gt; The enemy likes to lie. He does. &gt;&gt; Every every sickness and every illness &gt;&gt; is just a lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you bore in your body stripes &gt;&gt; on our behalf. Willingly, oh God, you submitted yourself not to the hand of Rome, but to the hand of your father because it pleased him to bruise him. &gt;&gt; Because by his stripes, we are healed. &gt;&gt; And today, Lord, we appropriate that covenant. We speak over every body today to come into alignment, Lord, with your will and with your word in the name of Yeshua, the Messiah. Lord, I ask that you would release faith upon your people today, Lord, that they would apprehend your promises, Lord, that you purchased with your blood. Let us reject every lie, oh God, and let us hold fast our confession of faith, &gt;&gt; and praise you, oh God, &gt;&gt; and praise you until that miracle bursts forth in this realm because it's already true, &gt;&gt; accomplished in that realm &gt;&gt; and we pull it forth today. Oh God, we pray for pastor for your healing hand. We just confess wholeness over him in the name of Yeshua the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Lord, for wisdom for your people in every decision. We thank you for leadership. We thank you for clarity, oh God. I ask that you would move by your spirit. Move away, Lord, every distraction, Lord, every cloud of darkness. and let clarity come and strike the hearts of your people, &gt;&gt; Lord. And in this season of thanksgiving, &gt;&gt; may we each remember what it cost you to come &gt;&gt; and how thankful we are, oh God. I pray for this service today, Lord, that it will be another installment of your purposes. I ask that each of us would have ears to hear, that our hearts would be receptive to your word, and that you would bring forth fruit in our lives, oh God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We just commit this service, this day to you. And we pray above all that you would be glorified, Lord, that you would be praised and that you would be pleased with your people today. We worship you, oh God, in the name of Yeshua, the Messiah. [snorts] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise your name, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory to the Lamb. &gt;&gt; You may have your seats today. &gt;&gt; He is good. He is faithful. &gt;&gt; Sister Sharon sent a testimony today. of this child that we've been praying for. It's been on the app, this baby Cohen that had gotten some bad formula and botulism. But anyhow, the the MRI or the MRA shows that the strokes he had are healing and the brain is resolving them. &gt;&gt; He should make a full recovery from them. No signs of vasculitis either. All good news. &gt;&gt; The bad news is the swallow study sh still shows some aspirating in the lungs. So they're worried about that. But uh they're putting in a feeding tube so they can do part of the feeding by mouth and part with this NG tube. So it's going to progress more slowly. But we're giving thanks to God for what he has done for this child. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; God is so good. He's so good. &gt;&gt; Sister Hannah, it's good to see you and Natalie and the children. They're the the babies. We're glad that they're here today. [applause] They've come home for a few days, then they got to go back to Arkansas. So, we're glad that you're here. Solomon and Zion, we're glad to see you. The Lord bless you. We're glad that you're here today. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; All of you home folk, we're sure glad to see you today. Glad that the Lord has kept you and strengthened you and helped you through the week. He's given you the grace you need for each day. He promised that he would give us daily bread. And it's not just the food in our mouth, but he gives us daily grace. when it looks overwhelming, he he somehow lets his mercy be renewed every morning. And so thankful for that. Brother Daniel, you have a song today. We're going to invite you to come while they're getting ready. We want to thank you for your giving. We appreciate the Lord that he has uh made way for you, for your family, and you have kept covenant with him in the giving of your tithe and offering. We're thankful that we have the opportunity to give to the Lord because everything that we have is because of him. And because that he gave it to us, we want to keep that covenant with him in the giving of our tithe and then adding to it an offering &gt;&gt; as he has blessed us. Brother Jesse, I'm going to call on you today. And brother Ellias, let these brothers come to you for the tithe and offering and we're going to give unto the Lord as he has blessed us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thanks for loving me. &gt;&gt; For loving me. &gt;&gt; For you have set &gt;&gt; my spirit free, Lord. I'm not one I used to be. Oh, [music] I said thank you, Lord, for loving me. My empty heart was heavy and no one seemed to care. My life was full of misery that no one else could share. My was in prison. I couldn't find a key until you open up [music] my life by loving [singing] me. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Thanks." &gt;&gt; And I said, "Thanks, &gt;&gt; love me. [singing] &gt;&gt; I need you. I have used &gt;&gt; my spirit free. [music] &gt;&gt; My spirit free. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm not one. &gt;&gt; I'm not one. &gt;&gt; I used to be. &gt;&gt; I used to be. Thank you, Lord, for loving me. [singing and music] &gt;&gt; I know you kept on loving when all I was. You kept [music] right on blessing me when I did not deserve. You've been the dearest friend that anyone [singing] could be. [music] So I say thank you Lord for loving me. &gt;&gt; And I [music] said thank you. &gt;&gt; I said thank &gt;&gt; for loving me. &gt;&gt; for loving [singing] me. &gt;&gt; For you [music] have set my spirit free. &gt;&gt; My spirit free. &gt;&gt; But [music] I'm not one. &gt;&gt; I'm not one. &gt;&gt; I used to be. &gt;&gt; I used to be. [music] I said, "Thank [singing] you, Lord, for loving me." &gt;&gt; I know you kept on loving [singing] when I was [music] returned. And you kept right on blessing me when I did not [singing] deserve. You've been [music] the dearest friend that anyone could be. I said, "Thank you, Lord, [music] for loving me." &gt;&gt; Well, I said, "Thank for loving me. &gt;&gt; For loving me, &gt;&gt; for you have set my spirit [music] free, Lord, I'm [singing] not one. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not one. &gt;&gt; I used to be. &gt;&gt; I used to be. &gt;&gt; Oh, I said thank you, Lord. [music] You want to try with us one time? &gt;&gt; Oh, I said thanks for loving me. &gt;&gt; For loving me. &gt;&gt; For you have set [music] my spirit free. I see. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm not what [singing] &gt;&gt; I'm not what &gt;&gt; I used to be. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, I said thank you Lord [singing] for loving me. &gt;&gt; Yes, I said thank you Lord [singing] for loving me. &gt;&gt; Sure is. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother Daniel and Sister Anna. &gt;&gt; I'm glad the Lord keeps on loving me. &gt;&gt; He doesn't fall out of love with me. &gt;&gt; And I remember something that Brother Perry Green used to say. He can't love me any more than he already did or does, but I can love him more. &gt;&gt; He keeps on loving me constant all the time. And because that he does, it causes me to want to love him more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Would you stand with us today as we're getting ready to go to the word? Well, I started out traveling for the Lord many years ago. [singing] I've had a lot of heartache, had a lot of grief and woe. [singing] But when I would stumble, then it would down. And there I would say I wouldn't take [music] nothing for my journey now. Oh, I wouldn't take [music] nothing for my journey now. Got to make it to heaven somehow. Though the devil [music] tempts me and he tries turn me around. He's offered everything that's got a name. All the wealth I want and worldly fame if I could. Still, [music] I wouldn't take nothing for my journey. Now [singing] there's nothing in the [music] world that will ever take the place of God's love. [singing] [music] Silver and gold could never buy his touch from above. [screaming] When my soul needs healing, I began to feel his power. I could say thank you, Lord. I wouldn't take [music] nothing for my journey now. Sing it out. I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now. I got to make it to heaven somehow. [music] Though the devil tempts me and he tries turn me around. He's offered [music] everything that's got a name. All the wealth I want and worthy fame. If I could still would take nothing for my journey. Sing the course again. Yeah. Wo. I wouldn't take nothing [music] for my journey now. I got to make it to heaven somehow. [music] Though the devil tempts me and he tries to turn me around. He's offered [music] everything that's got a name. All the wealth I want in worldly faith. If I could [music] still wouldn't take nothing for my journey now. I wouldn't. Amen. Give the Lord a praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't. You may be seated. I wouldn't take nothing for my journey. Now, &gt;&gt; I know that there are Yankees that were born north of the Mason Dixon line who may not know what that song means. Because in your refined English, you probably think, "I wouldn't take nothing for it." Means it's not much value. I wouldn't take nothing for it. But that's not what it means in the South. In the south, it means it's so valuable. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That you could not purchase it. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't take nothing for it. &gt;&gt; How many of you wouldn't take I I wouldn't take anything. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't trade anything &gt;&gt; for this journey. &gt;&gt; Are there parts I would erase? Yes. &gt;&gt; Are there parts I might would delete? Yes. &gt;&gt; But God said they've got to be there, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; The ups, the downs, the highs, the lows, the ins, the outs. &gt;&gt; Isn't he good? &gt;&gt; Well, you've been quiet a little bit this morning, but we we're just going to believe you're you're uh contemplating uh a a good week of giving God thanks. And &gt;&gt; I hope you weren't sitting there thinking about what kind of pie you're going to get because you'll need a sli half a slice half a slice of all of it. I'll just settle it for you. We had dinner with brother and sister Miller. Truman and uh brother Truman and Sister Martha Miller in their home. They've lived there over a year and have invited us. And every time we had planned to go, we got sick. One of the kids was sick, somebody was sick, and we didn't want to spread it. So, we didn't get to go. But we went this week and they had two kinds of pie. And my wife ought to know better, but she said, "What kind do you want? I want pie." That means a half a slice of both of them. And well, I think they were a little bigger than a half. But brother Truman, he showed me you really can get by with a half. He come back and his were two half pieces. If you slid them together, they would make a hole. God is good. &gt;&gt; He is good. &gt;&gt; He provides, doesn't he? I want to sing a song. We've had good singing already. You don't need mine, but I want to sing this song. It's called One More Valley. And I don't know if it's uh G or B flat or F or A flat or E flat or C or D minor. No minors any when I'm tossed. Will that work? No, that won't work. When I'm tossed on life sea and the waves [singing] cover me and the dark clouds won't let the sun shine through. There's a voice that seems to say, "Child, there'll be a brighter day. Don't allow [music] the storm to hide sweet heaven's view. Cuz you've got one more valley, [music] one more hill. Woo! Maybe one more trial, one more tear. Praise God. One more curve in life's road. Maybe one more mile to go. And you can lay down your heavy load when you get home. [music] It's kind of simple, but don't let Satan see your tears. [music] Try to learn to smile through all your fears. Hold your head up high. Give this world a smile. [music] Try to be faithful all the way. It will be worth it all someday for it's all going to be over after a while. Let me hear you sing. Oh, you've got one more valley, one more hill. You've got one more trial, one more tear. Oh, one more curve in life's road. Maybe one more mile to go. You [music] can lay down your heavy load when you get home. Don't let [music] Satan see your tears. Learn to smile through all your fears. Hold [singing] your head up high. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Give this whole world a smile. Try to be faithful [singing] all the way. It will be worth it all someday. For it's all going [music] to be over. Do you believe that after a while? Cuz you've got one more valley, one more hill, one at a time. Oh, you've got one more trial, one more tear, one more curve, one more curve in life's road. Maybe one more mile to go. You can lay down that old heavy load when you get [music] home. Sing it with me one more time. Oh, you've got one more valley, [music] one more hill. Praise God. And you've got one more trial, one more [music] tear, one more curve in life's road. Maybe one more mile to go. You can lay down your heavy load when you get home. [music] Sing that last line. Oh, you can lay down your heavy load when you get home. Amen. Somebody said, "Well, what in the world does that mean? You got one more valley and one more hill. You take them one at a time. &gt;&gt; And one of these days, &gt;&gt; one of these days, &gt;&gt; that'll that one will be the last one. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; If you try to get out way out there, too far ahead of God, it'll overwhelm you. &gt;&gt; But if you'll just look at one more curve, one more hill, one more valley, one more trial, hadn't he always brought us through? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand and go to the word. And while we're standing, let's clap our hands and give God praise for these wonderful, dedicated, faithful, anointed musicians. Uh Josh and Charity are away this weekend celebrating their wedding anniversary. Uh they, like us, chose, like Stacy and I, they chose Thanksgiving for their wedding time. and they rarely get to be away on uh dur right during that time and it's today I don't remember how many years it is sister &gt;&gt; nine years they ought to make it then nine years and uh so they'll be traveling at some point uh first few days of the week so we want to hold them up to the Lord in prayer and then tomorrow is his birthday brother brother Josh's birthday is tomorrow and uh he's up there in his 30s young 30s early 30s. And then on Thursday, uh well, on Tuesday, it's the homegoing of Sister Nancy Bergen from Jerusalem. And uh for for several years, she served this ministry with everything she had in her. And I still miss her. Uh she was a great blessing to us. And I never had to face a trip to Israel with anxiety when I knew that she was on the other end because she was an Israeli citizen originally from upstate New York but had lived as a missionary in South Africa had landed in the in Jerusalem and had never left. She became a citizen and she knew the ins and the outs and the ups and the downs and she had learned from Sister Ruth he how to laugh at all of them. And they never complained about anything while in the land because they believe that if you would give God thanks while wherever you are but particularly in Jerusalem. If you would give God thanks from Jerusalem that he would and and be dedicated to your call there that he would take care of things at home for you. And we saw God do that many, many times. And I'm preaching again this morning on Samson. And uh that that is a a memorable day. Sister Stacy was expecting one of I guess Mariah. And and Sister Nancy, I had found out from some uh Jewish man that the tomb of Samson was up on a hill. And she and she said, "Well, if you if he told you that and you're willing to try it, here we go." And I thought I would lose my wife. not not by death, but by divorce because she she was so pregnant and we shook her and shook her and shook her and she was holding on for dear life. But we got to see where Samson was buried and I appreciated that. But anyway, I think of her uh on her birthday and and uh on the anniversary of her death and then on the 27th is Eli's birthday and he's asleep, I think. And uh we want to thank the Lord for him getting to be in Alabama on his birthday. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's probably something I'm missing here. Sister Beverly is with her family today. Don't forget there's no service this Tuesday night, the 25th. But there will be a service the following Tuesday night on December the 2nd. Brother Jordan Peterson and his wife uh Martha and the children are going to be passing through here, we believe, and will be with us that night. We're looking forward to seeing them. Old friends from Tucson. We have fellowship meetings December 6th and 7th. That's Saturday night and Sunday morning with Brother John Thornton from near Raleigh, North Carolina. We're looking for the Lord to move in a mighty way. We're coming into a month where we get a lot of things stirred up. Number one, because we don't celebrate Christmas and that upsets all the folks here and there. And it used to be that at least our own tribe stood with us, but it's not that way anymore, but uh it's something I'm not intending to move on. And then we get a little bit of persecution around the 14th of December this year because we celebrate the feast of dedication. Our Lord did in John chapter uh was it chapter 10. And uh so I like to do that as well. And uh I think modern Judaism will just mostly refer to it as Hanukkah time. But I'm looking forward to it. It's a season of miracles. And I don't know about you, but I can always use a miracle. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn in your Bible if you will again to Hebrews chap 11 for just a moment. And I won't read Well, I'm not going to tell you what I might do. I'll read two or three and let you sit down. How about that? Uh verse 32 of Hebrews 11, the ending of the great chapter of faith, the hall of faith. And what shall I more say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson and of Jeffa, of David also and Samuel and of the prophets, who through faith who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouth of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword. Out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight. the armies of the aliens. Uh, God bless the reading of his word. You may be seated. And I'll ask you again this week, how did your week go? When you read that, you may thought you had a bad week. I had a week of hobbling around. But uh when you read all of this quench and fiery darts and and and all this uh stuff running from the violence of fire and stop the mouth of lions and escape the edge of the sword, then your weak and my weak look pretty good, don't they? &gt;&gt; But we overcome the same way they overcome. &gt;&gt; By faith. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Say it with me. By faith. &gt;&gt; We do. &gt;&gt; God was good. He's good. And uh I know you've had some pain and been fighting sickness too. No doubt uh even as I have. But God has been so faithful. I just woke up this morning knowing that he had really touched my body. My tendonitis was so much better and I found a shoe that was low enough in the back I could put it on and it's actually more comfortable. They the family said, "Well, you could just wear Crocs." And I said, "But you know, these shoes are actually more comfortable than the Croc would be. It gives some support for my foot and that's how much the Lord has touched me and I want to thank him. &gt;&gt; Uh women received their dead raised to life again. Others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection. Others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings. Yet moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were. Anybody been in prison this week? &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you didn't have to be there? There are people in this room that could have been there today. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Me. Who knows? &gt;&gt; You never know. &gt;&gt; I mean, I don't know that I've done anything that would, but that's not always what it takes either, is it? &gt;&gt; Amen. We saw that during COVID time. You can go to jail whether you deserve to go or not. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful I didn't have to go. &gt;&gt; They're stoned. I may have had some uh harsh words hurled at me this week or some I knew about and some I didn't know about, but I wasn't stoned. It It only might hurt my feelings, but it doesn't hurt my bones. It doesn't hurt my ability to keep going on. Nobody saw me aunderder. I did ram something under my fingernail, though, and it sure did hurt. But nobody saw me aunder. Aren't I glad I am? I didn't wander about in sheep skins and goat skins. I wasn't destitute, afflicted, or tormented. But all of these mentioned here went through all of that. And I love this so much. As I told you last week, verse 38 really gets me. Of whom the world was not worthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My the world didn't even know who they were. But this world in all of its splendor was not worthy to have those overcomers walking up and down the streets of the towns wandered in deserts and mountains and in dens and caves of the earth. And these all, no matter what they went through, no matter how hard their life was, no matter how large their sacrifice was, the scripture says clearly, very clearly, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise. How is it THAT YOU CAN GIVE UP all that and experience all that and pay such a large price and still not receive the promise? God to tell us through the apostle in verse 40, God having provided some better thing for us &gt;&gt; that they come on they without us should not be made perfect. No wonder they gather in the in the uh middles of of of eternity and and have vested interest in what takes place here on the earth. That great cloud of witnesses cheering us on because they without us will never find their perfection. When we finish as they finished, when we overcome as they overcome and were gathered together, the fullness of the promise of eternal life will also be theirs. &gt;&gt; They are not with, you know, we say with the Lord. We say that the scripture says to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord. But according to the scripture and the message of the hour, they're not standing before the throne yet. They're in another place of absolute perfect peace and joy and bliss and rest and love and light. &gt;&gt; But when we stand before the throne, we're going in together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even their old dead body laying somewhere has to have a change in it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And there's a reuniting. Brother Brandham tells us there's a reuniting that takes place. And we go back there not to meet the same body but to meet another body. We have a transitional body that is between the dead body and the glorified body for all eternity. There's a transition body called a theophony where the redeemed life, the Zoey life of Jesus Christ in you will dwell. And when that that time has passed and you enter into a new body, one like unto his, scripture tells us never again to know uh any kind of uh uh sickness or disease or infirmity or affliction. &gt;&gt; We're going to be with him for all eternity. &gt;&gt; I hope I didn't throw some of you. &gt;&gt; Uh just study the message. Just run it and it's there and it'll speak life to you and you don't have to wonder what there is on the other side. My You'd rather be there than here. I'll tell you that. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, I just thought they were before the throne." Everybody when they leave here, they just go right up before the throne. Now I'm very disappointed. I thought my mama was standing right before the throne. Look, look, sweetheart, you're the only one complaining. Mama's not. &gt;&gt; She'd rather be where she is right now than on this earth. Somebody said, "Well, you know, she don't love me. She doesn't. My loved ones don't miss me." No, brother, sister. I'm sorry to tell you, they don't miss you. &gt;&gt; They They know you. They know where you are. They often know things that are happening because they're cheering you on. &gt;&gt; But they're not just longing for you. They're at perfect peace. &gt;&gt; But they will have their perfection when we all meet together. Won't that be great? &gt;&gt; Are you here? &gt;&gt; Amen. So am I. Let's turn to Judges chapter 13. Now, we're talking about the anointing and and for a few weeks, we're talking now about Samson's anointing. I think it's important. The Lord directed me in this direction. And and in the next few services, perhaps not today, but we will get to it eventually. I want to talk to you about the glory of the latter and how much greater even in the life of Samson. The glory of the latter was so so uh significant. He went out of here with a greater glory &gt;&gt; than the one he came in here with. And so will this little bride. &gt;&gt; Do you believe you'll know him when he comes? &gt;&gt; You know why you'll know him? Because you're going to be just like him. &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture said. Isn't that good? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're reading now for just a moment about Samson. I don't want to go too far backward, but let's look at uh Judges 13:4 and5. Now, therefore, beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine. This is the message of the angel of the Lord to the mother of Samson. Don't drink wine or strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing. For lo, even though you've been barren, for lo, thou shalt conceive and bear a son, and he too will be set apart, no razor shall come on his head. For the child shall be a Nazerite unto God from the womb, which is a new concept. The Nazerite vow in the book of Numbers chapter 6 was something that a man or woman chose. There was a duration. It was not something they were born with. It was something that they took before the Lord. And there were restrictions of what they could participate in, what they could come in contact with during that time. When the days of the vow were expired, they were free from the Nazerite vow and they went on and lived their normal life. But God spoke to the mother of Samson, her name is not even mentioned in the scripture, and said, "You set yourself apart, for the for the child that you're going to conceive will be a Nazerite from the womb, and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines." 40 years of torture and torment Israel had been given by the Lord into the hands of the enemy. Do you remember that? And God said, "I'm not going to bring deliverance all at one time." Sometimes he brings it instantaneously, suddenly. It just overtakes a person. &gt;&gt; But most of the time it's gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, and then what? SUDDENLY, GOD SAID, "I'M NOT GOING TO DELIVER Israel all at once because if they got out from under the load all at once, they'd quickly forget the lessons that I wanted them to learn under the hand of the enemy." &gt;&gt; So, he said, "I'm going to leave them there for a while, and I'm going to begin deliverance. I'm going to put a light at the end of the tunnel." How many of you have ever been looking for that light? &gt;&gt; I'm going to put just a little hope where there has been no hope. And I'm going to let them know that even though I brought the oppressor against them, I'm going to begin to bring them out of his hand. &gt;&gt; I'm going to send a special child. And you're the one that's going to carry him, little mother. And he will begin to he will begin to deliver Israel out of the hands of the Philistines. I want to read one quotation from last Sunday. The God of this evil age, 1965. Brother Brandham said, "A Nazerite is one that is consecrated for a purpose." &gt;&gt; I wonder, is there anybody in here today consecrated for a purpose? Let me see your hand. Let me see your hand. &gt;&gt; Uh consecrated for a purpose. He said Samson was consecrated to a age and to a purpose. Therefore, he had long hair. And he said, "The woman that's a child of God lets her hair grow to show that she's consecrated to every word of God." I believe that that's no condemnation for anyone who isn't there yet. It's just the truth. And as I told you last week, is it's easier than you think. You just quit chopping it. And guess what? &gt;&gt; It'll grow as long as God will let it. For some people, that's almost to the ground. and to other people it's barely past her shoulder. But it's a sign regardless when a woman makes that dedication in a world today that'll tell you uh as a woman you'd look younger if you chop it off. You'd look younger if you'd make it another color. You'd look younger if you permed it with some kind of dangerous chemical and uh the pressure is on. &gt;&gt; But when a woman says no Siri, it doesn't even belong to me. Right? &gt;&gt; This is put here by the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's a way that God established that he would put a a sign of her submission on her head. And the scripture says it's power on her head. &gt;&gt; I tell you, brothers, don't we don't have power on our head. &gt;&gt; We're we're the head of course of the family, but this the woman has power over her head. You may not appreciate this example, but uh there there's a she's still alive. Her name is Fetus. I've never known a woman other woman anywhere by the name of Fetus. Have you tu? Her name is Fetus Tenny. And [snorts] her husband was the general superintendent of the United Pentecostal Church International. Their son left the holiness of the of his childhood and wrote the book The Godchasers. His name is Tommy Tenny. But Sister Thetus is a uh she attends the POA in Alexandria, Louisiana. And she's been a Bible teacher her whole life. And uh she was invited to come to a big big charismatic convention where no one in the room had had any hair. Just little poodle little poodle styles, you know, and uh Jacqueline Kennedy styles. And there was a preacher who who got up ahead of her. His name is James G. I've met him several times. And he got under such inspiration, a charismatic got under such inspiration about about Sister Theta sitting there, a woman of prayer and having that long hair on her head. And he said, regardless of what we moderns think about it, he said, the scriptures clear. She has a special authority with God because she's made this vow. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said that to all these women. I think they said there was 1,200 people there. And he asked sister only sisters will appreciate this sacrifice. Uh he asked her I would have never done such a thing I don't think unless the Lord made me. But he said sister theus I would love it if you would just take your hair out. Take it down and show people the authority that God has placed on your head. and and can you imagine a sister who's got it all pinned up neat and so [clears throat] forth and then the connotation, you know, of a woman letting her hair down and all of these things. And she said, "Before I even KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING," she said, "I had a nudge." And that nudge let me know that somebody there needed the message. Amen. &gt;&gt; She said, "I wasn't scheduled to teach the Bible that day, but she said, I had this strong impression that I was about to teach a bunch of women &gt;&gt; something about their prayer life." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And she began to take it down. And they I wasn't there, but I saw a portion of that service years later. And the glory and the spirit of God honored that dear woman, that dear mother. And the spirit of the Lord moved across that place. And there were women who stood in line to tell her, "I have received a revelation today. I'll never cut mine again. I want whatever it was that swept over this room when yours was down. I want that authority. I want to feel that in prayer." And if it's a co a price to pay, what a small price to pay. &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? Amen. &gt;&gt; I wish Pentecostals I wish I wish everybody could catch a glimpse of what God has done for that sister to require that of her but also giving her a special authority in her prayer. It's a type of bridal intercession and it's the most powerful intercession on the face of the planet. The bride's cry, the bride's prayer uh is a powerful thing and it's a sign of a separation. It was to Samson and it is even today. Are you still here? &gt;&gt; So then in verse 3 and 4 of Numbers chapter 6, it begins to give more of what this Nazerite vow would look like. And that would be that a person would separate themsel from wine and strong drink and vinegar of wine and uh not no grapes. You couldn't eat moist grapes or dried grapes. Uh it it was not allowed. And then in verse five, uh, all the days of the vow of his separation, there shall no razor come upon his head until the days be fulfilled in the which he separated himself unto the Lord. He shall be holy and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow, which is against nature itself, the scripture tells us. So for a man, it's a sacrifice in under this Nazerite vow to do such a thing. Now, nobody is calling you. Nobody is encouraging you in the dispensation of grace that you would take that kind of a vow. But it is it is certainly a type of the holiness separated consecrated life. Just a minute. Amen brother. &gt;&gt; And it's not optional for the overcomer. &gt;&gt; The nominal Christian. It seems to be calling on the name of the Lord is what is required. And we don't even know how the rest of it is going to shake out. &gt;&gt; But what we do know is the overcomer is going to get a hold of that book. &gt;&gt; And we're going to live it to the best of our ability. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we want to raise our children with answers. &gt;&gt; Not because I said so. We want to answer them with answers. with Bible answers, &gt;&gt; something that might help them as they go along. So Samson was going to be a Nazerite from the time of his birth. He could come not come in contact with the vine, the grape, anything to do with the grape. He could not come near a dead body and he could not put a razor on his head. His hair was to be divided into seven locks. Look at how spiritual, how prophetic, how symbolic it was that his hair would be divided by seven locks. What a number seven is. Some people call it God's divine number. It's a number of wholeness and a number of completion and a number of perfection. God was about to bring a deliverer who would not only begin to deliver Israel, but he would set an example even for us today that you can slip, you can fail, you can make a mistake, but if you'll stay faithful, if you'll bring yourself BACK TO THE PURPOSE of your birth in repentance, &gt;&gt; that God will not even remember against you the sin, the failure, the shame that you brought. This is good news. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I've disappointed him before. &gt;&gt; And so for me, it's very good news. &gt;&gt; In Judges chapter 13, verse 24 and 25, and the woman bare a son and called his name Samson, and the child grew, and the Lord blessed him. He was blessed in his mother's womb and he came from his mother's womb still under the blessing. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S VERSE 25 that I want to emphasize to you today. And the spirit of the Lord, this is Judges 13:25. And the spirit of the Lord began as he was going to begin to deliver Israel. The spirit of the Lord began to move him at times. Are you hearing that? &gt;&gt; In the camp of Dan between Zora and Echol, you ought to remember. It has something to do with the grapes. You can look that up. He he was from a place between Zora and Echol. The key is this verse 25. And the spirit of the Lord began to move upon him born with a blessing, his childhood under a blessing. And then there came a time that the spirit of the Lord began to move upon him. The New King James says the same. And the spirit of the Lord began to move upon him. &gt;&gt; And and another version said, "And the spirit of the Lord began to stir him." &gt;&gt; There's something different about this movement of the spirit on the life of Samson. Remember his name means sunlike, like the sun, little sun, ball of fire, belonging to the sun. It it's a beautiful picture because the Philistines were a culture steeped in darkness. And in dealing with darkness, what did God send? He sends a little son, &gt;&gt; Sam's son. Do you know that's what God sending in this last hour? &gt;&gt; An overcoming bride. &gt;&gt; Little sons. &gt;&gt; Oh, absolutely. &gt;&gt; CHIPS OFF THE OLD BLOCK. HE tells us. &gt;&gt; Amen. THE SAME LIFE THAT was in him in us. The same anointing that was on him on us. Not on us only, but in us. &gt;&gt; So what did God do to deal with darkness? He sent light. He sent sunlight. Didn't he do it? &gt;&gt; So the spirit of the Lord began to move on him. Not all the time. &gt;&gt; He didn't WALK IN IT ALL THE TIME. &gt;&gt; BUT AT TIMES, somebody say at times. &gt;&gt; At times, &gt;&gt; the spirit of the Lord began to move on him. At times, the Hebrew phrases describing the spirit of the Lord coming upon Samson here are extremely vivid and they're violent. Somebody say violent. &gt;&gt; Violent. &gt;&gt; A and full of prophetic depth. These are not mild terms like all of a sudden you just begin to feel something precious slipping over you. You know, you just come under some Have you done it? I have. Have you ever just come under what felt like oil? just just the sweet grace of God just moving very slowly his anointing reminding you of Aaron's uh uh oil that dripped down when he was anointed all the way down his garment just slowly moving down all the way down to the ends of his beard and dripping down his robe is ifad and all the way down rolling down his from his uh bottom of his ephod all the way down his legs and down to the very bottoms of his feet, the top of his ankle, just slowly, sweetly moving. But that's not what's being described here. This is a violent overtaking of someone by the spirit of the Lord. I won't ask you if you've ever experienced this, but I have. Rare occasion, but I have and I'm thankful. I wouldn't mind a little more of this. We're going to need it in the days ahead. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, this described even though it says, "And the spirit of the Lord began to move on him or move him at times." Move him is the emphasis. not move on him or over him but move him. &gt;&gt; You get it? &gt;&gt; These words are beautiful. The word in Hebrew is pam and it's a verb meaning to stir, to be stirred, to be troubled. It indicates an agitation. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Something that agitates, troubles, bothers a person, forcing them to act. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's one thing to be led, gently led. It's another thing to have the spirit of the Lord come on you &gt;&gt; and push you into a situation &gt;&gt; that you'd have been standing on the shore watching for a long time had you had your own choice. &gt;&gt; You know, God's got a way of getting his job done. &gt;&gt; He's got a way of getting his work done. &gt;&gt; And he may just have to start pushing us. Amen. &gt;&gt; It means to stir, to trouble, to thrust, to push, to beat violently. IT MEANS TO PULSE LIKE A HAMMER. &gt;&gt; The spirit of the LORD BEGAN TO PULSE HIM LIKE a hammer. &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you what the word means. It &gt;&gt; It's It's certainly different than just a warm feeling just began to overtake him. I want you to see IT MEANS TO IMPEL someone into action. &gt;&gt; It's like inertia pushing them forward. This isn't gentle prompting. &gt;&gt; It carries the idea of a divine STIRRING THAT FEELS MORE like an internal pounding. &gt;&gt; God hammering a calling into him. In Jewish interpretation, it's the spirit driving him, not Samson initiating anything &gt;&gt; on his own. &gt;&gt; Some people jump out. Hear this. &gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE JUMP out ahead of God and then blame God. &gt;&gt; Well, I didn't want to do it. I didn't really want to do it. That's not what I really wanted to do. Wrong. You did what you wanted to do. And now you're going to blame God &gt;&gt; because somebody looked at you like you've lost your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not what we're talking about. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE lacking wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Being foolish, &gt;&gt; being weird, &gt;&gt; and stepping out to do something and blaming God for it. He's tired of being blamed for our foolishness. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're talking about the spirit of the Lord coming mightily on Samson. And the the scripture is beautiful here because it helps us to understand that Samson didn't initiate any of this on his own. &gt;&gt; He didn't even know he WAS GOING TO KILL A LION. &gt;&gt; He didn't even KNOW HE WAS GOING TO KILL 30 Philistines &gt;&gt; just because he could. HE DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS GOING TO TAKE A JAWBONE OF AN ASS AND slay a thousand men. &gt;&gt; He didn't even know he was going to walk off with the gates of Gaza. &gt;&gt; But each time the scriptures clear, the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him. It began to move him. It impelled him. It drove him. IT BEAT INSIDE of him like a hammer. Lord. &gt;&gt; A few weeks ago, I talked to you about a burden from the Lord that I was carrying at the time. And when I found the Hebrew meanings of some of these words, it helped me more than anything I found in a long time because it's how it was feeling on the inside. My heart was pounding like a hammer and I couldn't get out from under it. No matter what I tried, there was no way to relax yourself out of it. There was no way to break out from under it. It was like something had had overtaken the inside of me and was just pounding me to prayer, to pray, to read the word, to study, to get ready because God was about to do something. I I don't want to ever get out from under it completely. But I'm thankful that he gives us a little relief sometime so that we can live a life, a normal life, at least every now and again. It's a serious thing. It's not just for a special person. It's for whoever will surrender, whoever will yield. There's an anointing that is promised for the bride in the scripture and in the message that's beyond just a good feeling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HE SAID IT'S A PERSON &gt;&gt; AND HE'S WANTING TO TAKE OCCUPATION. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO NOT JUST VISIT YOU. HE WANTS TO OCCUPY YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND IN ORDER TO PREPARE YOUR HOUSE for him to come and take over, YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH YOUR EYE GATE. YOU'VE GOT TO GUARD YOUR EYE GATE. YOU'VE GOT TO GUARD YOUR EAR GATE. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO GUARD YOUR MOUTH GATE. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He told us you're not going anywhere else. You're not going any further. Nothing great else is happening unless you're willing &gt;&gt; to pay a greater price. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's look at this for a moment. the spirit of the Lord. I I think maybe I might have given them uh part of this definition to come. Maybe I didn't give them the the one for spirit. But but the spirit, the Hebrew word there is ruah or ru. It's a feminine noun. Remember that in Hebrew, every noun has a masculine and a feminine form, even the table. And the table takes on a na a feminine form or a or a male form depending on who's at the table or what the table is for. So in Hebrew, the form of the noun changes depending on the [clears throat] person that is connected. Do you understand that? And so I would use a different word for table. If I was talking about uh Sister April is using that table for her puzzle that she's putting together. Uh that would be different than for me to say brother Robert is studying uh on that table. And then in Hebrew we would use a different word altogether for table which makes it so complicated. You think English is complicated. Thank God in English we don't have to change the whole structure of the sentence depending on the male or the female that may be using the table or cleaning the table or whatever. So don't be offended or or thrown off by the fact that this ruach or ruah is a feminine form of a noun. It means spirit. It means wind. It means breath. But it's NOT USUALLY REFERRING TO ordinary wind ordinary breath. It's generally referring to that of deity, of God, God's wind, God's breath, God's spirit. And this noun occurs 387 times in the Old Testament and almost all of those times referred to in the feminine form. The spirit, the breath, the wind of God began to blow on Samson. What makes this particular place that's translated in English, the spirit of the Lord, what makes this different is the Hebrew word that's placed with it, which is a verb. And the Hebrew word is tlah. And it comes from a Hebrew word salah. Oh, here it is. A verb meaning to rush, to break forth, to come mightily. It describes the Holy Spirit's effect on persons making them powerful or particularly strong. Uh, is that all or do you have the rest of it? And it gives some references. Judges 14:6 and 9:15 and 14 1st Samuel 16:13 of where this form of the spirit of the Lord is used. It has caused persons to prophesy and there are the references there in 1 Samuel. It has the sense of persons breaking out. Listen, breaking out. THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD BROKE OUT on Samson. It speaks of rushing forward into a battle. I don't know who's anxious to go into a battle and risk his life. But if the spirit of the Lord is rushing you, &gt;&gt; if the spirit of the Lord is breaking out on you, you'll find yourself doing something that you wouldn't be comfortable doing just of your own natural ability or decision. Amen. Send it, Lord. It also can mean God breaking out in acts of judgment as in Amos 5 and6. So please understand that what Samson was experiencing was the spirit of the Lord coming on him mightily in a breakthrough form pushing him compelling HIM. WHY? BECAUSE HE WAS born for a purpose. I want to tell you TODAY THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU WERE BORN, GOD HAS AN ANOINTING &gt;&gt; THAT IS SUFFICIENT. HE HAS AN ANOINTING THAT IS JUST RIGHT for whatever your position is. If he's called YOU AS AN EVANGELIST, HE HAS AN ANOINTING THAT'S BIG ENOUGH AND BOLD ENOUGH and powerful enough to make you an evangelist. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he's CALLED YOU TO PROPHESY, HE HAS AN ANOINTING THAT'S JUST RIGHT. &gt;&gt; It's not going to trickle down on your head like a drippy faucet. It's going to rush over you more like a waterfall. Grant it, Lord. &gt;&gt; GRANT IT, OH GOD. SOMEBODY SAID, "THIS IS OLD TESTAMENT. Are you KIDDING ME?" ACTS CHAPTER 2. &gt;&gt; Do you think THAT WAS A DRIPPY FAUCET THAT CAME IN THE UPPER ROOM? &gt;&gt; Or was IT WHAT THE SCRIPTURE SAID IT WAS? AND A RUSHING MIGHTY WIND BEGAN TO BLOW [screaming] INTO THAT ROOM. COME ON. AND UH IT APPEARED OVER THEIR HEAD LIKE CLOVEN TONGUES OF FIRE and everyone began to speak in languages that they had never learned. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the church was being born. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that's the original Catholic church. Anything after that is the imitation. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE CHURCH. The birthing of the church was on the day of Pentecost. AND HE DIDN'T BIRTHE IT WITH A TRICKLE OF ANOINTING. HE BIRTHED IT WITH A WATERFALL, &gt;&gt; A MIGHTY TSUNAMI OF his anointing. &gt;&gt; And I want you to know, this bride is going to need MORE THAN A DRIPPY FAUCET. &gt;&gt; WE GOT SOME STUFF TO OVERCOME. &gt;&gt; And we're GOING TO NEED IT TO BREAK IN MIGHTILY IN OUR LIVES. THEN WE MUST PREPARE. THEN WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE LETTING THE LORD BUILD A HOUSE IN US &gt;&gt; THAT'S SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO know when it's time &gt;&gt; for a trickle and it's time to be bold. David would be ANOINTED TO PLAY SOOTHING music &gt;&gt; on the harp to soothe the tormenting spirit that had taken over the life of God's once anointed and now tormented King Saul. And David would come with this soft anointing and he would play that soothing music and even the demon spirits that had taken over Saul's life would have to calm down in the presence of that calm, sweet, restful, peaceful anointing. God knew what David needed at the moment. But when David was facing Goliath, he didn't need that calm, sweet, quiet, sacred. They like to say, these corn uh uh uh hillbillies, I'll say it that way. These hillbillies didn't know what sacred was until they read it in the message. But now they love to use that word sacred, which is really a description of a dead church or a dead service or a lifeless bunch of people. And they call that sacred. That's not sacred. Sacred is getting under the presence of the Lord. IF IT'S CALM AND IT'S HIM, IT'S SACRED. BUT IF IT'S MIGHTY &gt;&gt; AND IT'S HIM, &gt;&gt; it's still sacred. &gt;&gt; It's sacred because it's yielded. It's surrendered and it's divine. It's not sacred because it's quiet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody said, "Oh, I like I like more Fanny Crosby hymns because they're sacred." Well, I want you to know that every every hymn that Fanny Crosby wrote wasn't calm, quiet, soothing. &gt;&gt; She understood in her condition that there was a time that the spirit of the Lord wanted to bubble up and rise up and raise up in people. I like them both. I like the peace that that sweet manifestation. Same spirit. Please understand. Same spirit OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; SAME SPIRIT OF the Lord, &gt;&gt; but a different manifestation. I like to just sit and weep gently, quietly in his presence. But I also like to dance like a drunk man &gt;&gt; when the spirit of the Lord comes down. See, the same David that played the quiet harp under the anointing of the Lord needed another form, another manifestation of the same anointing when he faced a giant. WHEN HE SAW THE ARK OF THE COVENANT WAS COMING BACK from the house of Oed EDOM AND WOULD NOW DWELL IN a tent, the tabernacle of David WITH AN OPEN CHAMBER ON MOUNT ZION. AND HE began to dance before the Lord. He didn't do it in the same calm, &gt;&gt; anointing, &gt;&gt; soothing, sacred, sweet manifestation that he had played for Saul. Oh no. He danced like a wild man. And he said to his uh uh uh denominational wife, he said to her, "If you don't shut your mouth," King James says, "Hold your peace." The Hebrew didn't say hold your peace. It would be translated more like shut your trap. Shut up. SAME KIND OF EXPRESSION JOB HAD TO USE. YOU TALK LIKE A FOOLISH WOMAN. SHUT YOUR MOUTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's not nice to tell people to shut up and accept in certain circumstances. This was A GOOD CIRCUMSTANCE. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP, I'M GOING TO BE WILDER, VIER, MORE ENTHUSIASTIC WHEN I DANCE THE NEXT TIME." Was he anointed? He was. &gt;&gt; He was. The spirit of the Lord moved in that meeting that day and it was the same spirit and it was the same anointing of God but it moved in a different manifestation. Please be careful how you judge. Uh your discernment needs to be highly and finely tuned because we need to know. We can recognize that it's him but we need to know how does he want to move? Does he want to come and come in and calm us and soothe us like the bomb of Gilead? Or does he want to come IN AND LIGHT A FIRE UNDER US? &gt;&gt; That we can't contain. &gt;&gt; I know brother Brandon makes a few little statements along the way about not losing control. Well, I want you to know I'm sorry to say that that's exactly what this scripture means in Hebrew. The spirit of the Lord came so mightily on Samson that in that moment it would have been nearly impossible for him to do anything but what the spirit drove him do. &gt;&gt; I can see where that would be very helpful for some of us hesitators. We put it off and put it off. We wait on that gentle breeze. Come on. &gt;&gt; And then the tsunami hits and we're picking up pieces because we've moved and it can't be undone. I don't KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'VE [screaming] MOVED before because I was compelled to move, driven to move. &gt;&gt; And as soon as that anointing lifted, I would have done everything within my power to have undone it. But there's no undoing what's done. &gt;&gt; It's particularly when God has done it. &gt;&gt; And there's battles that must be fought. There's situations that must be confronted. And we're going to have to have a breaking out, a rushing forward into battle. We're going to have to know all the different ways the anointing of the Lord can move on us. &gt;&gt; I want you to know it was the same spirit of God that operated in the ministry of Moses. Same spirit of God operated in the ministry of Moses that operated in the ministry of Joshua. Same spirit of the Lord, same anointing, same shecka, but there was a different administration. There was a different government. There was a different form and there was a different approach. Same spirit, same anointing, but a different government, a different administration, handled differently. Same word, same truth, same experience with God. But the season changed. And when the season changed, the anointing remained the same. The word remained the same. But the way that word was handled and THE WAY THINGS WERE DEALT WITH, IT BECAME DIFFERENT. AND IT HAD TO. AND IT HAS TO AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It has to again. IT'S JUST THE WAY OF GOD. IT'S THE WAY HE WORKS. It's the way he moves. HE MOVED THE SAME ANOINTING THAT MOVED IN ELIJAH MOVED IN ELISHA &gt;&gt; BUT IN A double portion &gt;&gt; WITH A DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATION. &gt;&gt; And where men and women and everybody in between have made mistakes through the years. IT'S THINKING THAT GOD HAS TO MOVE ON YOU JUST like he moves on somebody else. &gt;&gt; Or you HAVE TO EXPERIENCE IT IN THE SAME WAY THAT SOMEONE ELSE EXPERIENCES IT. BUT I DON'T STRUGGLE WITH THAT BECAUSE OF MY BIG MAMA, &gt;&gt; because of Haven's Carter. Because God showed her and she showed me, taught me. One gets it in that quiet little reverential reverence way, sweet way, her face glowing, and some get it like bulls in China closets. But it's the same Holy Ghost. It's the same spirit of the Lord. I like how everybody talks about how humble brother Brandham was when he came out to the pool pit. You know, he was he was just so meek and mild and and good evening friends. His head tilted to one side, one shoulder raised a little higher than the other, and people would say the spirit of the Lord. You could feel the atmosphere shift. But I want you to know, he didn't maintain that tone throughout the entire sermon. &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't stay in that posture the whole time he preached. &gt;&gt; That's how he broke the ice. THAT'S HOW HE PUSHED the darkness back. But brother, when he was preaching on Jezebel religion, &gt;&gt; WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT A BACKSLID church laying her head in the lap of Delilah, &gt;&gt; SAME ANOINTING SAID good evening friends. &gt;&gt; SAID YOU BOBBEDHAIRED WOMEN CALL YOURSELF CHRISTIANS. SAME ANOINTING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SAME GIFT OF GOD IN HIS LIFE &gt;&gt; but a different administration. &gt;&gt; That's why I had a long argument with someone, great discussion. It sort of ended up kind of in an argument. That's what happens when two hard-headed people try to come to to agreement sometimes and it was over brother Ben Brandon being angry. And I said, "No, he wasn't angry. I mean, he was capable of being angry. There are times he was. There are things that made him angry. There are things that made Jesus angry. That's right. &gt;&gt; But just because he raised his voice and his words got a little sharper as they went forth, it doesn't necessarily mean he was angry. &gt;&gt; The gospels describe it as the zeal of the Lord's house. It was a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. The zeal of the Lord's house had overtaken him. It caused him to change the way he appro approached something. the truth the same, the the the the word, the message, the of truth the same, the anointing the same, but the administration changing a little bit because it's time. There is a one age, so to speak, is coming to an end and another manifestation, another administration of what God wants to do in the end time is coming forward. And that's really in so many ways where we are because he preaches to us about a bride age. And he preaches to us about the last church age being the Leodysian church age. Well, now if I can add properly, if you add something to the seventh church age, what do you get? You get an a eighth age. AND HE HIMSELF PREACHED against eighth age. He said, ' If there's another one, that's the millennium. &gt;&gt; And yet, you would hear him talking about coming into that bride age. And so, we understand then by watching it carefully, looking at it carefully through the scripture that at the end of Leodysia, LEODYSIA IS STILL on for the church. Yes, sir. But at the end of Leodysia, there is another age breaking forth to a people &gt;&gt; that were elected. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; CHOSEN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "IS THAT ELITISM?" I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO CALL IT, BUT THE APOSTLE CALL PAUL CALLED IT ELECTION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU YOU CAN CALL IT WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. THE THE THE CULT HUNTERS AND THE CRITICS out there will say all kinds of things about the gospel that brother Brandon was preaching. BUT IF THAT'S ELITISM, I I don't know. I I don't know what to say. Some people carry it so far that it becomes bride pride. I know that. BUT IT'S NOT PRIDEFUL TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE THE CHURCH IS DROWNING IN THE LAST HOURS OF LEODYSIA, THERE HAS TO BE A BRIDE. PEOPLE THAT START STEPPING HIGHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's right. &gt;&gt; SO, IS IT LEODYSIA OR IS IT BRIDE AGE? WELL, IT DEPENDS on who you're asking BECAUSE THERE COMES A TIME THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT SOME ARE STILL IN THE CLUTCHES OF LEODYSIA WHILE others are beginning. There'll be forerunners, won't there? &gt;&gt; There'll be forerunners, won't there? &gt;&gt; There'll be arrowheads, &gt;&gt; that have to go ahead to clear the way. &gt;&gt; There always has been. There always will be those. That's a remnant. It's a remnant. And in the story of Samson, I'll go right ahead and tell you, in the story of Samson, the remnant is represented in in typology as the lad. That little boy represents a remnant, RAISED AND CALLED OF GOD TO BE CONSECRATED. &gt;&gt; FROM THE TIME OF THEIR spiritual birth, they become Nazerites unto the Lord. Not in the sense of defiling by the dead or drinking of the wine or eating of the raisin, but in a sense of being set apart. A and God can do what he wants to do. &gt;&gt; He provided a general. He provided a hero like Samson. But he also provided that little boy, a remnant. And and what purpose? What purpose did that little boy become? He became eyes. &gt;&gt; He became eyes. He could see what Samson couldn't see. Brother Brandham said that Samson represented a backslid church, compromised, cold, indifferent church. What had once known the fire, had once known the spirit of the Lord, had once known what it felt like to have your field set on fire. &gt;&gt; Now she had burned over. The fire had gone out and she was frigid and cold. She couldn't see. It's Leodysia. It's a description of Leodysa. Cold and blind. And you know, she thinks she's rich, increased with goods. She's really naked. &gt;&gt; SHE HAS NO CLOTHES TO COVER HER NAKEDNESS BECAUSE THE ONLY THING THAT COULD COVER THE NAKEDNESS OF LEODYSIA IS THE REVEALED WORD OF THE HOUR. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND IN THE ABSENCE OF THE REVEALED WORD OF THE HOUR, THE CHURCH STANDS BEFORE GOD TODAY NAKED &gt;&gt; WITH NOTHING TO COVER her nakedness. &gt;&gt; But there's a bride simultaneously while the church is under the throws of Leodysia. There's a little bride. Uh she's getting something to cover her her uh neakedness with her her molds, her freckles, her come on. all of her and it's coming layer by layer. It's not all at one time. It's being made real to her. Even though the word has been opened and it's been revealed and the message has come, it doesn't dawn on us all at once. It doesn't take a hold of us all at once. &gt;&gt; It takes a hold of us how gradually gradually gradually. SUDDENLY, &gt;&gt; I GOT IT. MY EYES ARE OPEN. NO WONDER THEY SAID EUREKA BECAUSE THEY'D had an epiphany. &gt;&gt; And that's WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IN THIS BRIDE AROUND the world. SHE MUST HAVE A WAKING UP. &gt;&gt; AND GOD WILL USE A FORERUNNING REMNANT REPRESENTED BY THAT LITTLE LAD WHO WILL TAKE THE HAND OF A BACKSLID BRIDAL [screaming] CHURCH. AMEN. IF SHE'S WILLING &gt;&gt; AND BECOME EYES TO SEE WHAT she cannot see. &gt;&gt; So how important is the remnant? How important are those who are willing to say boldly say that every word that brother Brandham said on those tapes is not thus sayaeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; You see there's a bridal church who can only see that. It's all thus sayith the lord. Even when he said uh Jesus the second person of the trinity and even after 63 when he said and the holy ghost the third person of the trinity he said why that's what he is. That's wrong. He's not that. And brother Brandham knew he was not that. &gt;&gt; So for you to say that everything he said about the Holy Ghost even is thus sayeth the Lord, you'd be wrong. You're not dishonoring that man. &gt;&gt; You're letting him be what he was, a yielded vessel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who could MAKE A MISSTEP. HE COULD he could uh use the wrong word DESCRIBING SOMETHING. HE could say 700 AND 7,000 AND 700. There's so many things. But we didn't know back then what we know now. They were hanging on it every word, thus sayeth the Lord. Because they were building this cult, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This tape cult. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's a cult. &gt;&gt; It's what they're building. &gt;&gt; Every word, thus say the Lord, it's all Oh my. It's God veiled in flesh. It's his on and on. They go on and on and on. I I asked a brother recently. I said, "Why is it necessary to to to have brother Brandham appear 13 times in the book of the Revelation? WHY DOES HE HAVE TO BE ALL OF THEM, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; WHY IS IT NOT ENOUGH FOR HIM TO BE ONE OF THEM? WHY DID HE HAVE TO BE THE ANGEL IN THE SUN? WHY DOES HE HAVE TO BE THE ONE WHO JOHN BOWED TO? WHY DOES HE HAVE TO BE THIS ONE OR THAT ONE OR THE OTHER ONE? WHY DON'T WE JUST LET HIM DO AND FINISH the job AS HE HAS THAT GOD SENT HIM TO FINISH AND LOVE him as he told us to love him, OUR PRECIOUS BROTHER, BUT NOT TRY TO MAKE HIM MORE THAN a man. &gt;&gt; Because if you do, you leave no room for the bride. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE'RE STILL STUMBLING WITH MISTAKES AND WE'RE STILL BLUNDERING AT TIMES AND WE STILL MISSPEAK AT TIMES. IF JESUS COULD BE OUR EXAMPLE, then brother Brandham must also be our example. And in order for us to understand his position, we have to let him be a man. &gt;&gt; And that's why he kept saying, "The world is yet to see what what can happen if one man is yielded completely to the Lord." You may not be aware, and I hope you're not, of some of the things I'm even referring to, but I can tell you the spirit gets stronger week by week by week. So strong that in the last two weeks from headquarters, they've sent out this message to say that only the tapes, by the tapes and tapes only, can the bride even be changed. Oh, let me tell you something. The quickening power doesn't live on magnetic tape. &gt;&gt; The truth of the quickening power is on magnetic tape. But the quickening power doesn't live. Brother Brandham said God does not ordain machines. &gt;&gt; Listen, &gt;&gt; it's you you say it doesn't really matter. It's It is going to matter. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT IT MATTERS. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT IT MATTERS &gt;&gt; JUST AROUND THE CORNER THERE. YOU'LL SEE THAT IT matters because God is preserving even now around the world a remnant &gt;&gt; who can see what Samson is no longer able to see. &gt;&gt; And she will be necessary. That little remnant will be necessary to help Samson get back in position. Somebody said, "I don't even believe it says that." OH, HE SAW IT. Get in step, [screaming] &gt;&gt; little bride. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, that had to be brother Brandon's voice to call the bride back in step." Please, is it his voice or God's voice? &gt;&gt; If it's his voice, HE'S NO LONGER AROUND TO DO IT. IF IT'S GOD'S VOICE, HE SAID THE FINAL VOICE OF GOD TO THE AGE WILL NOT BE. HE DIDN'T SAY IT WOULD BE IN THE SEVENTH AGE PROPHET. HE SAID IT WOULD BE WHERE? IN the &gt;&gt; in THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT trying to usurp or take anyone else's place or to bring someone else down or to point out someone's humanity over and over and smear it around. But what we're trying to understand is there is a scriptural way to see what's happening in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if the devil can cause you to cling to erroneous doctrine of denominationalism, he will. But if he can cause you to be blindsided &gt;&gt; by the error &gt;&gt; around the message &gt;&gt; so that your focus is on a man instead of the stature of the perfect man. &gt;&gt; Your focus shouldn't be on your pastor. right? &gt;&gt; Your favorite preacher. Because if you listen to the ones I listen to, they're all saying the same thing these days over and over and over and over and over and over again. They're more excited now about the cloud than they've ever been in their entire life. And they beat it like a mule. They beat it and beat it and beat it and dance about it and shout about it, sing about it. And it's like brother Brandham said to us when that spirit of the Lord came down during the time of the church ages and the pillar of fire came and hung in the tabernacle there and uh put on the wall the images that brother Brandham had drawn on the board of the waning moon. Do you know what I'm talking about? the the the eclipses of the moon, the waning of the moon and the pillar of fire come and hung over the congregation and took that that he had written there on the board and reflected it on the back wall for everyone to see the confirmation and people screamed. You can hear it. They screamed. And what did brother Brandham DO? HE SAID, "THERE'S TWO OF THEM. One is the real and one is the reflection. &gt;&gt; And he said, "What you're looking at is the reflection." The real one is there. The whole crowd had been captured by the reflection. And let me ask you a question. Is the reflection greater than that which has reflected? Absolutely not. IT'D BE LIKE SAYING THE MOON IS GREATER THAN THE SUN. The moon is a lesser light &gt;&gt; REFLECTING THE LIGHT OF THE SUN. THAT'S WHAT A PROPHET MESSENGER HAS TO DO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE WOULD BE A LESSER LIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; REFLECTING THE GREATER LIGHT &gt;&gt; of the son of man. &gt;&gt; A SON OF MAN PROPHET REVEALING the son of man, the Lord Jesus Christ. COME ON. &gt;&gt; THEN WHAT WOULD THE BRIDE BE? HE called the bride a moon. THEN WHAT MUST WE REFLECT? LIGHT, &gt;&gt; not not moon moonshine, [laughter] &gt;&gt; SUNSHINE, &gt;&gt; THEN WE ARE A LESSER LIGHT OF THE SUN. AND THAT MEANS WE REFLECT ONLY the sunlight, &gt;&gt; that little bride. Oh, you watch her. You watch her. She's going to find her way. &gt;&gt; She's going to find her way. And the remnant will help point her there. Absolutely. Not the son of a prophet. The son of the prophet is a distraction. You have Africans posting all over social media that that Joseph Branom has has now taken the place. Are you kidding me? You you mean the young man who was on a motorcycle with his long hair and his cigarette packed roped wrapped up in his uh t-shirt when when they were hearing the last sermons of brother Brandham after his death in the high school. Joseph was out serving sin. So was brother Brandham before the Lord called him in. I'm not disqualifying him for that. But I'm saying when he had an opportunity as a boy to be humble and soft and prepare himself for whatever it was that God was going to call him to do, instead he was running in the other direction. I have no doubt in my mind that the Lord has raised him up to lead the the the the furtherance of getting the message to the people. But a seventh church age messenger doesn't have a successor. &gt;&gt; If brother Brandham tells us there's not an eighth messenger, &gt;&gt; he tells us there WILL NOT BE AN EIGHTH MESSENGER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; DOESN'T MATTER WHO HE IS. NOT LEE, &gt;&gt; not Brian Kokeric OR HOWEVER YOU SAY IT OR ANY OF THE REST. &gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO. HE DOESN'T NEED AN EIGHTH MESSENGER. HE NEEDS A LESSER LIGHT &gt;&gt; TO REFLECT THE SUNSHINE. AND HE IDENTIFIED HER AS A MANY MEMBERED BRIDE, &gt;&gt; A BODY OF MANY PARTS, BUT MOVING TOGETHER IN SYNCHRONIZATION, &gt;&gt; IN DIVINE ORDER &gt;&gt; to get the job done, &gt;&gt; not pointing us to one. That little lad was one, but he represents a remnant of people who said, "Come here, strong man." I remember I remember the stories. Let me help you get back to where you need to go. Let me be your eyes. I can't do I can't that remnant cannot do what what the bridegroom is to do. We can't do anything except what the Lord would let the remnant do. He said, "I can't, you know, in his mind, I I can uh finish your job, &gt;&gt; but I can help you get to where you need to be &gt;&gt; so that you can finish your job." We don't hear that little boy trying to push against the pillars. He just tried to get Samson back. I'll show you. I'll show it to you. If you're struggling with it, hold on. Give me a few more weeks. Laying a foundation. But he had a purpose. Even brother Brandon tells us he had a purpose. He Samson was born for a purpose. That little lad was born for a purpose. wasn't the same purpose, &gt;&gt; but both will bring glory to God. &gt;&gt; And it's not one little lad. It's one little lad and symbol. But it's that little bride that many who will call for the resurrection, the final voice of God to the ages. &gt;&gt; She'll have thus sayeth the Lord or she'll keep still. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Yeah, you're just always pushing that off, folks." That's the reality of it. &gt;&gt; It's it's one more hill, one more valley, one more curve. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT SU THAT GRADUALLY IS GOING TO BECOME THE SUDDENLY. &gt;&gt; But I don't THINK I'D BE WRONG TO TELL YOU IT COULD BE BEFORE the end of the year. It could be in THE NEXT YEAR THAT'S COMING. WE DON'T KNOW. &gt;&gt; But the bride's revival that they claim they've been in for 40 years has not yet struck the bride. &gt;&gt; Because when it does, &gt;&gt; she'll get in place. &gt;&gt; She'll pull the whole thing down. Yes. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, that means her death." No, it means her translation. &gt;&gt; When California goes down, &gt;&gt; something goes up. &gt;&gt; Is that right? I think I think it's right. &gt;&gt; So, this spirit of the Lord, what time is it? 116. This spirit of the Lord that moved mightily means to burst forth, to break out, to push forward, to advance forcefully, to succeed by sudden power. This is not a gentle descent of a dove. It's like a rushing, erupting, explosive empowerment. Now, here's what you need to know about Samson in closing. And and and and did the Bible say that that child would be the beginning of deliverance for Israel? This is the beginning of the closing. [clears throat] The deliverance is not coming all at one time. Neither's the closing. Oh, when I said that, I can see Kad and Jenna, can't you? In the There's my little doohickey fell off again. Uh, I can see them in the skit. I've watched it again and it is still extremely funny. We're going to have to have some of those manuals printed up to give visitors to get them ready for how we do things around here. All right. The sages, and brother Brandham refers to the Jewish elders at times, not all are Pharisees. They studied and they learned and they wrote and they passed down both truth and tradition. It takes the Holy Spirit of God to be able to discern between truth and tradition in Jewish uh writings. And it takes the Holy Spirit to be able to discern between truth and tradition in the message because there's some things that people practice in the message around the message that aren't scriptural at all. They're just traditional. And and and God doesn't hate tradition. If you think he does, you've misunderstood him. &gt;&gt; But what he does despise is when tradition begins to negate the promise. &gt;&gt; When tradition keeps people from receiving the promise, you better change your tradition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And catch up with the promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The sages interpretation of Samson is a little bit different than what your Baptist Sunday school showed you about Samson. When you see a picture of Samson in a Bible story book, he looks like the Tony Atlas I was talking about. You know, he's standing there with his golden muscles rippling, shining in the sun. He looks like the biggest tank that's ever walked the face of the planet. But Jewish tradition and teaching says he was certainly not that. And if he was, the question is asked then why would in Judges 16:E5 why would the Philistines have to have kept asking the question wherein his great strength lith? They keep saying we need you to find out Delilah. We need you to find out what is the source of his great strength. Now, if he had all those big muscles and he looked like the strongest man that ever lived on the planet, then they wouldn't have had to keep asking Delila. They would have said, "Oh my goodness, he can bench press all of all the Philistines at one time. Look at him. He's a tank moving across the road." &gt;&gt; But Brother Brandham calls him a looking fellow. Brother Brandham said he probably had a hairbo. [clears throat] He uses the word multiple times when trying to describe the ordinary look of Samson. It's interesting to me because what that means is the source of his strength had nothing to do with his muscles &gt;&gt; because brother Brandham does refer to Samson later in the story as having muscles. By the time he pulled the pillars down, brother Brandham is again referring to muscles. But in the beginning, he's letting us know that the source of Samson's great strength does not lie in his gym membership. Not in his preworkout or his creatine or his supplements or his testosterone boosters or his metabolism boosters or any of the other drugs that people uh get excited about. It was only in the spirit of the Lord that didn't trickle down on him. It moved mightily upon him, impelling, propelling him to be obedient to God. Powerful. The sages say, you can find this in the Midash. You can find this in the Targums. And for those of you that haven't heard explanation about the Targums, I'll do it very quickly. The Targums are ancient writings that were originally written in Aramaic, which was the language that was spoken predominantly in the time of the Lord Jesus. Yes, there were people still speaking Hebrew, but not as many as you would think because the Jews had been assimilating through the years. They had been under the Babylonian influence. They had been under the Philistine influence. They had been under the Assyrian influence. They had been under the influence of the Greeks. Now they were feeling the impression and the and the oppression of the Romans and so they began to speak a mixture of languages referred to as Aramaic. And so what what the Targums were is they were writings ancient documents that were written in the time of Christ in Aramaic. And what these documents do is they help us to see what was being taught at the time of the second temple or during the ministry life, the life ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ. It's actually very interesting uh to look at on occasion because it helps people to understand. For instance, we realize from looking at the Targums and I've told you this before that the Jews did not believe that their Messiah was going to be a holy man like God or the son of God or powerful like God or or spiritual like God. They certainly didn't believe in the time of the second temple period that he was going to be God. So for Jesus to say to people in the second temple period, when you've seen me, you've seen the father, the poor people in the synagogue were not being told that when Messiah came, he was going to be &gt;&gt; like the father or the father. And so they were they were they they were blown away because what what I'm saying is the teaching of the people had become so watered down, so compromised, so mixed that they weren't even teaching the entirety of the Old Testament. And so the Targum sometimes helps us to understand that people weren't they were looking for a military general. &gt;&gt; They were looking for a powerful messiah who would lead an army in revolt &gt;&gt; against Rome. They weren't looking for a sandalwearing uh blind eyeopening, LEPROSY CLEANSING SEA WALKER. They were looking for a general who would rally the Jewish armies and those bands of revolters and bring them back and they would stand united against Rome. And so for it if you if you understand that it makes everything richer because then you get the scripture we talked about the other day. He stands up in the temple uh on the particular day that Isaiah's prophecy of Messiah's ministry is going to be read. And he gets up and reads the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach. And then he goes and sits down and says this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears. And they go, "What? This is what the Messiah is supposed to be? The spirit of the He's supposed to preach. He's supposed to set captives free and give sight to the blind and open prison doors. So, he's spiritual. We thought he was mighty. Isn't this Joseph's son from Nazareth? Who Who is this guy? He knows better than the sages. He knows better than the Tamud. Can you imagine? And he did &gt;&gt; because the word made flesh was standing before them. &gt;&gt; No wonder he said it. But when you look at the Targums, it helps you to understand that in many ply many ways the people were just, you know, because they'd been hearing it for 700 plus years. He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. And only a few little virgins kept knitting booties, believing. Brother Bram tells us, believing that Messiah was going to come. But but the church at large, we could say the Jewish community at large, they give up on the idea of of a of a holy man. And this is just going to be a general. The only hope we have is for somebody to come and drive the Romans out. my did they get more than they bargained for &gt;&gt; because the destruction of the temple and some of the greatest destruction by the Romans took place after the ministry of the Messiah &gt;&gt; after he had already gone into heaven and then the temple destroyed and they're thinking, "Oh my goodness, we thought things would get better." So even believers began to question. We thought things would get better WHEN THE MESSIAH CAME AND NOW THE TEMPLE IS GONE. &gt;&gt; BUT ALL OF IT IN GOD'S PLAN BECAUSE he wanted them to know, I don't want to live forever &gt;&gt; and a house of stone. &gt;&gt; He wanted them to know, I WANT TO LIVE. I'VE GOT A BETTER WAY FOR YOU. I want to live IN YOU. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO LIVE ABOVE YOU ANYMORE. I DON'T JUST WANT TO LIVE WITH YOU ANYMORE. I WANT TO LIVE IN YOU. Isn't it powerful when you see it? &gt;&gt; So many of these writings that are preserved from second temple period and beyond will tell you that that Samson was not unusually muscular, that his appearance did not explain his strength, that his strength came directly from the spirit of God. And that is why the Philistines constantly ask wherein his great strength lith. Judges 16:5. WHY? BECAUSE IF SAMSON LOOKED LIKE A GIANT BODYBUILDER, the Philistines would not have needed to even ask the question. Their curiosity itself supports the ancient view that he appeared normal, ordinary, maybe even unimpressive. Am I messing with your songs? Am [clears throat] I upset in your Bible stories? &gt;&gt; A am I am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am I uh contradicting the the books we read to our children and the pictures that we show?" Samson might have been wormy. He didn't need the gym membership. The spirit of the Lord was moving mightily on him. I need a few more minutes. This is this is beautiful because it goes through scripture. He wasn't the only one. in 1st Samuel 16:13. I'm going to read it in the amplified quickly. Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed David in the midst of his brothers. And the spirit of the Lord came how? &gt;&gt; Same Hebrew word, rushing upon David from that day forward. And Samuel arose and went to Rama again. Mightily it overtook David. mightily it fell upon him. Powerful. And in 1st Samuel 11:6 amplified again, the spirit of God came mightily upon who? Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was greatly kindled. What what what happened? The spirit of God overtook him and his anger was greatly kindled. You have to read the context to understand it. The spirit overpowered Elijah. The spirit made Elisha run ahead of Ahab's chariot. That's more than a trickle down feeling. &gt;&gt; A little bit of spirit, little inspiration. My hair I think my hair is standing up on my arm. Oh, no, no, no. This is a seizing. THIS IS GOD SAYING, "YOU'RE MINE, [screaming] AND I'M GOING TO USE YOU FOR MY GLORY. YOU WERE BORN FOR A PURPOSE. THE WOMB THAT GAVE YOU BIRTH WAS SANCTIFIED AND SET APART. AND FROM YOUR MOTHER'S WOMB, YOU WERE A NAZERITE. AND MIGHTILY, I'M GOING TO TAKE A hold of your life now and use you for my glory." &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Oh, I wish that could be me." then you're going to have to make the same consecrations. Very few at this moment are willing, but you just wait. There's an hour coming when when the when those who are unwilling now will be willing. &gt;&gt; You know, God's able to change your willingness. Right. &gt;&gt; He's able to bring circumstances upon us &gt;&gt; so tight, so difficult, so unusual, so out of the ordinary &gt;&gt; that we're desperate. &gt;&gt; We don't even lock the building. It's all night prayer meetings until somebody can break through and be filled with that kind of a power, a spirit of God that breaks forth. It'll make you pay more attention in church. It'll make you sleep less when you get here. &gt;&gt; Come on. It'll do all kinds of things for your life. It'll make you show up. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; We're nearly done. I have a few little quotations I want to read to close this out. This is uh the middle part of the closing. This is in a sermon, a wedding supper. He said, "When that robe, paragraph 35, when that robe comes in there, when that robe comes in, there's a little hidden power that comes down in your heart that all devils in hell can't make you doubt it." &gt;&gt; Come on. that hidden power, NOT WITH A GREAT BIG something across your forehead. And a doctor of divinity wrote this way. It's an inside hidden power. &gt;&gt; Amen. HE SAID, "IT'S BEEN GOD'S PROGRAM since the first lamb was slain in the Garden of Eden or outside the garden." Right? Samson had it. He had a HIDDEN POWER, A TOUCH OF THE HOLY GHOST. He said, "Now, a lot of people say Samson had shoulders like a barn door." He said, "Well, it wasn't." Well, some of these here artists that tries to paint his pictures that that would be no mystery to me to see a man with shoulders like barn doors to slay a lion &gt;&gt; or to take up a gate and walk away with it. But Samson was just a little bitty mama's boy. A LITTLE CURLYHEADED UNCOSHER shrimp about like that. He said, "Now that's what fooled the people." AND HE WAS JUST AN ORDINARY BOY. HAD SEVEN LITTLE CURLS hanging down his back. Looked like a little THAT'S RIGHT. EVERYBODY WOULD LAUGH AT HIM. I don't doubt it. A TYPE OF THE HOLY GHOST CHURCH. HIS OWN CHURCH DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; He was a weakling. BUT WHEN THE HOUR COME THAT GOD WANTED TO USE HIM, &gt;&gt; HELLO. &gt;&gt; HE WAS A GIANT, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; Now listen, listen carefully. God wants a church that he can lay his hands on. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many of you want to be a church? You want to be a person. You want to be an individual and A CORPORATE PEOPLE THAT GOD CAN LAY HIS hands on. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; JUST ONCE MORE, LORD. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, I don't I don't care how little it is. two or three gathered in my name. Not some show, some production, some performance. &gt;&gt; It's the anointing that destroys the yoke. &gt;&gt; It's not noise. &gt;&gt; It's the anointing. There are a lot of folks who can make a lot of noise, but they don't have the anointing that a housefly has. &gt;&gt; And so, it's just hollow. It just sounds so hollow. It means nothing. It shifts nothing. It changes nothing &gt;&gt; because it's a vacuum instead of a constant. Lord, send us an outpouring IN THE INSIDE OF THE INSIDE THAT WILL SO OCCUPY US, SO ARREST US, SO POSSESS US &gt;&gt; that we can't get out of the way. And when I say out of the way, I mean we want to be out of your way, but not out of the way. God wants a church that he can lay his hands on. I don't care how little it is. Two or three gather in my name, I'll be there in the midst. Not just speak it. Then you say, "Well, we gather in his name. Speak in the name of Jesus by word." It's not what he meant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So much as it is the attitude, &gt;&gt; the attitude that you're gathered in. Did you come today just because you are waiting for the last amen so that you can go out and brag and tell somebody standing out in the front of the church of all of your wonderful deeds this week or all the things that have happened to you? Did you come with an attitude to be seen? Did you come with an attitude to see somebody else, see who would be here, see who's responsible for this cough that goes around? Or did you come with an attitude that says, "Lord, I don't know what you're going to do, but I know it'll be good." &gt;&gt; And I'm coming to get my cup full of it. &gt;&gt; He said, "The motive that you come in, the attitude." He said, "AS IT IS THE ATTITUDE, YOU'RE GATHERED IN the environment of the name of Jesus." When you gather in my name, then ask what you will. It's the motive that you come in the attitude. It's an attitude instead of so much of a calling a name. Sinners call that name on the street cursed and everything else. But it's the environment that you're in, the attitude that you come coming in Jesus name. How many of you believe you understand that? And then in a in in a is that the same one? No, it's a in in paragraph 36. These are long paragraphs. That was one paragraph. He said, "I can see Samson. He was on his road to see his girlfriend. Little boy. His little mommy fixed his little curls up. Here he was going down to see his little girlfriend. AND A GREAT BIG LION RAN OUT AND ROARED AT HIM. He was helpless. You know, a sissy's helpless against a lion. The Bible said that the spirit of God came on him. It didn't say he had had enough protein until his muscles were pumping. You could see the blood running through the vessels. No, it says the spirit of God came upon him. And you you're going to you're going to figure it out if you haven't already. HOW IMPORTANT IT NOT BY MIGHT &gt;&gt; NOR BY POWER, &gt;&gt; BUT BY MY [screaming] SPIRIT, &gt;&gt; MY BREATH, MY RUACH, &gt;&gt; THE HOLY THE HA KODESH, THE HOLY ruach of God. His breath that changes more than a name. &gt;&gt; HIS BREATH CHANGES CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. His [clears throat] change HIS H HIS BREATH CAN CHANGE THE ATMOSPHERE. HIS BREATH CAN CHANGE MY ATTITUDE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOURS, TOO. &gt;&gt; You need it, too. &gt;&gt; The Bible said the spirit of God came on him. HE GRABBED THAT LION. OH. ordinary little fellow, seven curls down his back, mama curled his hair for to go see his girlfriend. The these are just dramatizations, but I like them cuz I don't think I'll ever look like Schwarzenegger in his uh heyday. But God's not looking for that. He's looking for somebody that's willing &gt;&gt; to be apprehended for his purposes. It's not something new. It's the reason you were born. It's just getting back to try to figure out why you were born. You were born for something. God doesn't make up your destiny. I don't understand this thought of destiny as though it's made up as you go along. We serve a sovereign God who knew the end from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Before your days were ever written in his book, he knew them all. Surely he didn't make it up as he went along. He had a destiny set for you. You fall off of it sometimes. You wander away from it. You marry the wrong person. You do something you have no business doing. You run after the almighty dollar. You get your eyes on that how successful you can be and how stupid you have to look to get there. And you miss the fact that you were born for something so much higher than that. But without the anointing, you better stick with your day job &gt;&gt; because it's the anointing that breaks the yoke. It's the anointing that makes the difference because it's not a feeling. What is it? It's a person. &gt;&gt; You're moving out so he can move in. &gt;&gt; Here come this lion. GRAB THAT LION LIKE IT WAS A LITTLE GOAT. The Brandon says later it weighed 500 600 lb. I got a feeling it might have weighed a little more than that even. That's not a little goat. That's a big That's a big creature. &gt;&gt; And he just tore it like it was a goat. What a man he was. Listen. When the spirit of God came ON HIM, &gt;&gt; HE HAD A HIDDEN POWER, AMEN, THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM. WELL, THAT SAME SPIRIT OF GOD IS THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY SPIRITS OF GOD ARE THERE? ONE. DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIONS, different governments, different ways of moving. Same Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He said it's a hidden power. Yes. and he slew the lion as if it would have been just a kid. Isn't that good? &gt;&gt; Read on. I don't think we're done with that one. How powerful he was. Not because he had brawn or brain. Because he had a hidden power. Now the man musicians are coming. That's always a better sign. Now, the man with this hidden power, IT'S NOT SO MUCH AS YOU WOULD COULDN'T OPERATE ON HIM AND find it. Brother Benham SAID YOU COULDN'T CUT HIM OPEN AND FIND where that little hidden power lays. The doctor might cut him in pieces, but he looked like an ordinary man. &gt;&gt; And they wonder, "What is it? What it is?" Some people think it's a rabbit's foot that you rub behind your ear. They do. Does that sound silly? It sounds like today, but it isn't. It's the power of the Holy Ghost that's been brought in by divine grace by God our father. And fill that individual with his presence. You will RECEIVE LIFE, [screaming] &gt;&gt; ETERNAL LIFE, ZOE, GOD'S [screaming] OWN LIFE DWELLING IN YOU. OH, what a hidden power. Look at Judges 14:5 and 6. I just want you to at least read the reference. Judges 14:5 and 6. Then went Samson down and his father and his mother to Timnath and came to the vineyards. Oh, Samson, why are you going down to where the vineyards are? You're under a perpetual Nazerite vow. You It It It ought to make sense. We're nearly done. It ought to make sense to you if you're supposed to stay away from moist grapes, dry grapes, vinegar, juice, grape, wine. You You do don't really want to take your vacation to Napa Valley because that's where the grapes are. But there he goes. It's the beginning of his compromises. It's the reason why he lost his strength and power. It's the reason why he gave his secret away. It's the reason why he lost his seven locks. Because he kept putting himself in a position. Hear me now. &gt;&gt; He kept putting himself in a position where compromise was easier than resistance. Huh? in a position where compromise is easier than resistance. If I can just get away from my mom and daddy's house, I can do what I want to do. Oh, can you? Well, that's funny because we're going to send the Holy Ghost after you. &gt;&gt; We're going to believe that God is the all-seeing eye and the all hearing ear wherever you put your body and that he'll hold you to the same standard that your parents held you to. And in some of your cases, I hope it's a higher standard than your parents uh held you to because your compromise is partly their influence. &gt;&gt; They went Samson down and to the vineyards of Timnath. And behold, a young lion roared against him. Okay, he was young. And the spirit of THE LORD CAME MIGHTILY UPON HIM. Same word. OVERTOOK HIM, RUSHED IN UPON HIM, BROKE OUT ON HIM. &gt;&gt; WASN'T HIS TEMPER, WASN'T HIS FEAR, IT WASN'T ADRENALINE. IT WASN'T AN OVERACTIVE STRESS RESPONSE. &gt;&gt; COME ON. THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD, THE RU of Y, &gt;&gt; YAHWEH, THE BREATH OF YAHWEH CAME UPON HIM AND he rent him as he would have rent a kid. And that's a goat, not a child. And he had nothing in his hand. No weapon, unarmed, no club. Oh, have you seen the picture? Have you seen the pictures in the the Bible story books? He's got a lion there and a club and he's going to hit the line. That's not what the scripture said. In fact, it's anti-word. &gt;&gt; He had NOTHING IN HIS HAND. WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S WRITTEN HE HAD NOTHING IN HIS HAND? SO THAT YOU WOULDN'T TRUST THE GUN OR THE CLUB &gt;&gt; OR THE SPEAR OR THE ARROW OR THE BOMB OR THE CATAPULT OR THE TANK OR THE BOMBER. SO THAT YOU WOULD KNOW THAT VICTORY COMES BECAUSE THE SPIRIT OF THE Lord &gt;&gt; broke out on him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had nothing in his hand, but he told not his father or his mother what he had done. That word here is the same but a little variation. It's vit and it means it rushed upon him like a violent force. And in that moment that the spirit of the lord came upon him in a violent force. He tears that lion in half like he was just a little kid. One more quotation and we're really done. No service Tuesday night. So this you can tack this on to Tuesday night. This one comes from Acts of the Holy Spirit. I've really got this out of whack, but I'm almost finished with it. Paragraph 44 said, "Look at Samson when he found the lion RUN OUT TO KILL HIM AND HE SLEW THE LION when the power of God came upon him." Slew him. WHAT? THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS HAND. HE slew the lion when the power of God came upon him. Slew him with his bare hand. Just probably did what? He probably just pulled his jaws apart. I'd say that would hurt him. Wouldn't you? You can laugh. You can laugh. I'm not preaching longer because you liked it. You can laugh. A LITTLE BITTY CURLYHEADED SHRIMP about that high. Little bitty old fella scrawny. Look. Oh, I see some around here. Think make me think of that. More than one. Some have hair. LITTLE BITTY OLD FELLA SCRAWNY ON THE STREET. SEVEN LITTLE LOCKS HANGING AROUND HIS HEAD LIKE A LITTLE AND HE WAS NO he was no more than a little [laughter] until the spirit of God &gt;&gt; until the spirit of God came upon him and how did the Bible say it came upon him mightily MIGHTILY NOW IT WOULDN'T BE HARD TO believe that a great big giant Goliath for instance could slay a lion with his hands. I believe he could do it. But what's the funny thing was this little bitty fella done it. &gt;&gt; I like it like this. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Because then nobody else gets the credit, the praise, the accolade. &gt;&gt; BUT THE SPIRIT OF [screaming] THE LORD CAME UPON him and slew THE LION. HE SLEW THE LION, THREW IT OVER TO ONE SIDE, and the bees built their hive in there, and Samson, the sweetest honey he ever eat, come out of the carcass of that killed lion. Is that right? Why? He overcame it with what? &gt;&gt; The power of God. You've got something you want to eat sweet honey from. Listen, is there something operating in your life that you would like to see God provide honey from it? &gt;&gt; Is there something that's been bitter, THAT'S BEEN BONDAGE, THAT'S BEEN HARD, that's been oppressive, THAT HAS NEARLY TAKEN YOU OUT? &gt;&gt; COME ON. AND YOU'D LIKE TO SEE GOD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT &gt;&gt; AND GIVE YOU A TASTE OF HONEY from the middle of the thing that was sent on assignment to destroy your life. The Ram said, "If you got something you want to eat honey from, just overcome it." How? &gt;&gt; Mind over matter. &gt;&gt; Psychology. &gt;&gt; Sigman fraud. Who's a fraud? or with the power of God. The power of God sounds religious. The power of God sounds traditional. The power of God sounds old-fashioned. The power of God might sound outdated or antiquated to you, but it's the only way. &gt;&gt; It's the only way to kill the lion in your life. It's the only way to defeat the enemy in your life. It's the only way to drive OUT THE THE SQUATTERS in your life. the Philistines who brought their darkness right into the land. God wants to use YOU WITH HIS POWER &gt;&gt; TO RIP THAT ENEMY, TO RIP THAT SPIRIT, TO RIP THAT THING, that oppression, that burden, that heaviness that has come to take you over, to take you under, to take you out. And he wants to give you something sweet from it. Yes. &gt;&gt; He wants to give you strength and power to set the fields of the Philistines on fire &gt;&gt; by tying the tails of jackals. King James says foxes, tying their tails together and putting fire torches in their tails. I was I was impressed with foxes, but I'm even more impressed if it might have been jackals. these these things are were hideous. And he just grabs them up like little puppies and next thing you know, ties their tails together, sticks fire brains in them, and sends them. And they're just spinning cuz they're all tied. Their tails are tied together. You've seen a dog chase his tail. What do you think several of those wild creatures would do with their tails tied together and a fire brand did them and they go running out through the barley fields, setting the enemy's fields on fire? We used to sing that song in the old church when I was a boy. He will set your fields on fire. If to sin is your desire. You have heard Jesus call. Heed it lest you soon must fall. Let the Lord your soul inspire. If you join the heavenly choir, then rejoice with him. When the sun grows dim, he will set this world on fire. [screaming] &gt;&gt; We were rough. We sang rough songs in the old &gt;&gt; and then they pick it out on the guitar like Chad Atkins. It was good days. IF YOU got something YOU WANT TO EAT SWEET HONEY FROM, OVERCOME IT WITH THE POWER OF GOD. WATCH HOW GOOD IT IS. OH MY. PASS BY. MAYBE YOU'VE BEEN A DRUNKER AND YET EVERY TIME YOU SMELL WHISKEY or beer or something, YOU WANT TO DRINK IT. OVERCOME IT &gt;&gt; BY [screaming] THE POWER OF GOD AND PASS BY ONE TIME AND SEE WHAT A [screaming] FEELING. WOO! YOU GET IN YOUR HEART WHEN ALL THE THING IS DEAD AND GONE THEN ALL FINISHED. When you have BEEN ABLE TO RESIST, &gt;&gt; my brother Brandham is preaching, isn't he? Yes, SIR. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU'RE ABLE TO RESIST THE THING THAT CAPTURED YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. &gt;&gt; But today, the power of God gives you strength. &gt;&gt; And you don't look at the sexy stuff. You don't follow the the link. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You go down and sit in the living room with your wife. Get out of the back of the house, you buzzard. &gt;&gt; Get out there where your family is. Turn that screen around so that anybody that walks in the room can see it. &gt;&gt; Do whatever you have to do to overcome that thing. And when you do just one time, it'll make something happen. It'll give you such a peace, &gt;&gt; such a joy. HE SAID, "OVERCOME IT by the power of God and pass by one time and see what a feeling you got in your heart. When all the THING IS DEAD AND GONE, THEN ALL FINISHED. OH MY, that sweet honey, you get out of it." He said, 'Now these people had really overcome on the day of Pentecost. They were all filled with the Holy Ghost. The powers of God was upon them. They had gifts given to them TO SPEAK WITH TONGUES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And everything. They were just having a marvelous time. And the church was on fire. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, send the power once more. Send it once more, Jesus. Hallelujah. You didn't believe me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We need it, Lord. We need it. We've got to have it, Jesus. We've got to overcome. We've got to have it. It's you we need. It's you, Jesus, we need. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Throughout my history, your faithfulness has walked beside me. The winter storms made way for spring. &gt;&gt; In every season, from where I'm standing, the evidence of your goodness all over my life. All over my life. And I see your promises in fulfillment [singing] all over my life. All over my life. Oh, and I see the evidence of your goodness all over my life. All over my life. And I see your promises in fulfillment all over my life. All over my life. Help me remember when I am weak. That fear may come but fear will leave. And you lead my heart to victory. And you are my strength, Lord. and you always will be. I see the evidence of your goodness. [singing] It's all over my life. All over my life. And I see your promises in fulfillment all over my life. all over my life. And help me remember when I am weak. Oh, that fear may come, but fear will leave. And you lead my heart to victory. Oh, and you are my strength. And you always will be. I see the evidence of your goodness. It's all over my life. All over my life. And I see I see your promises in fulfillment [music] all over my life. All over my life I see the cross, the empty grave. The evidence is sinless. All my sin was rolled away because of you, oh Jesus. I see the cross, the empty grave. The evidence it's sinless. And all my sin was rolled away. Because of you, oh Jesus, I see the cross, the empty grave. Oh, the evidence is sinless. All my sin was rolled away because of you. Oh Jesus, I see the cross, the empty grave. The evidence is sinless. All my sin was rolled away because of you, oh Jesus. Oh, and I see the evidence of your goodness all over my life. All over my life. And I see I see your promises in fulfillment. They are all over my life. All over my life. And I see the evidence of your goodness all over my life. &gt;&gt; All over my life. Yes, sir. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I see your promises in fulfillment. &gt;&gt; All over my life, all over my life. &gt;&gt; And all the earth will shout your praise. Our hearts will cry. These bones will sing. Oh, great are you, Lord. And all the earth will shout your praise. Our hearts will cry. These bones will sing. How great are great great are you Lord and all [music] the [singing] earth will shout your praise. Our hearts will cry. These bones will sing. Oh great are you Lord. [singing] All the earth and all the earth will shout [music] your praise. Our hearts will cry. These bones will sing. Oh great are you, Lord. It's your breath in our lungs. Oh, we pour out our praise. We pour out our praise. It's your breath in our lungs. So we pour out our praise to you all. It's your breath in our lungs. So we pour out our praise. We pour out our praise. to your breath in our lungs. [music] So we pour out our praise to you only. Lord, teach us the life of yieldedness, &gt;&gt; the life of consecration, &gt;&gt; the life of word inspired priorities. Lord, we want to be a people that you can work in and work through. &gt;&gt; When we see ourselves and when we know what we know about ourselves, we put ourselves out of it. &gt;&gt; And you keep coming by your word and by the worship and and by the spirit putting us back in. We we get tired, Lord, of struggling with you, wrestling with your angel. We just want to believe. You know, I'm reminded just now a sister and her husband who had an interview with Brother Brandham, and she said to Brother Brandham, I better I better see if I see it here. She said to brother Brandham, "I I I don't know how I'll find it. I have it in my notes." But she said, "I just don't feel like I'm saved sometime. It's really is here. it is. Her name was Sister Mary and her husband was Brother Bill. And he said to her, "We can't go by feelings. We go by the word." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham looked at her and he said, "90% of the time, I don't feel like I'm saved." Can you imagine? Well, I wasn't there when he said it. And this is her testimony that's going around the world. She said he said to her 90% of the time I don't feel like I'm saved. But he said we can't go by that &gt;&gt; now. Listen at what he told her. This is what I feel like you've got to carry out of here. He said we can't go by that. What you have to do when you're nervous like that, you need to look out there and see yourself LIKE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE. WHAT THE WORD SAYS you are. &gt;&gt; And then go by that. &gt;&gt; How many of you believe that's good advice? &gt;&gt; YOU JUST GET AN IMAGE. &gt;&gt; MAKE YOU AN IMAGE. &gt;&gt; MAKE a picture in your mind of what it would look like if you were walking in the victory that God has already won for you. You don't have to WIN IT. &gt;&gt; IT'S WON for us. &gt;&gt; Look how free you'd be. Let's look out over yonder. Everybody turn your HEAD THAT WAY. LOOK OUT OVER YONDER AND SEE HOW FREE YOU WOULD BE. HOW HOW YOU WOULDN'T WORRY OVER EVERY LITTLE THING. YOU JUST [screaming] TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD AND GO ON REJOICING NO MATTER HOW DARK IT LOOKED. &gt;&gt; THEN HE SAID YOU JUST START MOVING TOWARD THAT. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, that sounds spooky." Does it really? You do worse than that in your mind every day. &gt;&gt; I do, too. Well, what if and what if and what if and what if? Worried, troubled about something that may not even h How many of you have sorted out things that never did happen? &gt;&gt; Rung your hands or what if that doctor tells me this? What if what if I have to do that? What if I what if I what if I have what if they tell me I have and it don't even happen. &gt;&gt; So, don't tell me that it's it's hocus pocus to make these things up. Make images up. At least this one's got truth. It's true. He said, "Just look out over yonder and see yourself how the word has you. Oh Lord, it has me free. It has me healed. It has me whole. It has me delivered from all my pain of the past. I don't have any more daddy issues or mama issues or other other kinds of issues, inferiority complexes OR OR OR WHATEVER ELSE &gt;&gt; over yonder that one the word says I am. Now, if I move toward that and ignore the rest, &gt;&gt; don't you know he's able to roll us over the tide? &gt;&gt; Let me pray for you. If you feel like you spend too much time in the whatifs and not enough time in seeing what God has already done and said, just hold up your hand. I'm not even looking. You don't have to be ashamed of it. It's a reality of this life. But neither do you have to keep repeating wrong behavior. I want you just to hold your hands to him. Then we won't know who did what. Father, here we are. We're just humans. You made us. You know how it is to live in a body of flesh. And so many times we worry and we're troubled and we make dumb quick decisions over suppositions, over things we suppose could be. FATHER, WHAT SIMPLE ADVICE YOUR PROPHET gave this little sister. And and IF YOU JUST HELP US TO SEE WHAT your word says we are out there somewhere and give us faith, maybe you should may maybe we need to ask you to move on us mightily by the spirit of the Lord and help us to find our way to what you say we are. Faith replacing, displacing doubt and TRUTH DRIVING out lies. May we become the very anointed of the Lord. Every one of us. Every mama in her home, on her job, every daddy, every husband, every wife, every young person. May we just come under a greater heaviness of your anointing to be changed to get out of our heads to move into your heart. Your purpose is your plans. Your word is yay and amen. People have worried this week over who's going to make the gravy. and all other kinds of foolish things that matter nothing. Cuz the day after it's all over and forgotten, if somebody forgot the gravy, guess what? We just ate it without it. Nobody cared the next day. Lord, please help us not to get caught up with so many little things. May we just move in faith knowing that you have a plan and a purpose. And may we not use up any brain power over things that matter not. May we just when we read that word, may we just get a clear picture of who you've called us to be and let faith arise and move us in that direction in the name of Jesus. Somebody could, one person, maybe a streamer could take this right now and have a different day, a different evening, a different week because they began to see themselves as God has seen them and said they are in the word. Lord, LET IT BE SO. HEAL THE SICK. You're still a healer. You paid the price. We claim it today. In the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we ask for help. And we're going to give God a hand clap of praise. Let's do it. [applause] You can go back to your seats for just a moment. We'll get ready to go home. And uh I'm going to do one thing. Before I do, if I can have this one on, I'm going to sing one more song and it's not for you, but you can listen. But when Joshua came out to the platform, where is Elelliana? Oh, there she is. When Joshua came out to the platform to bring me a drink, he said, "Dad, I know you're, you know, you're probably not going to sing again, but if you were to sing again, Elelliana's been asking the whole service for Ghost." I said, "I don't know what he said." Well, they were listening to it on the earlier this morning. So, let's do a couple verses in chorus of Holy Ghost will set your feet to dancing. For Elelliana, she turned 18 months old this week. I had my first visitation from the Lord when I was 18 months old. So, look at that little child there and how how tall she is and what she looks like. I wasn't that pretty, but I was that age when when he visited me the first time. Let's sing this to the Lord. You might not be able to sit down, but if you need to, you can. The Holy Ghost will set your feet to dancing. The Holy Ghost will thrill you through and through. The Holy Ghost will [music] set your feet a dancing. He will set your heart a dancing too. Come on. Well, the Holy [music] Ghost will set your feet a dancing. The Holy Ghost will thrill you through and through. The Holy Ghost will set your feet a dancing. He'll set your [music] heart and dancing, too. Well, now David danced before the Lord to magnify his name. In God's almighty presence, he felt no sense of [music] shame. The oil of gladness flow that day. It quickened every part. And God gave brother David and shout in his heart. Oh, the Holy Ghost will set your feet a dancing. The Holy Ghost [music] will thrill you through and through. The Holy Ghost will set your feet a dancing. [music] He'll set your heart a dancing too. Well, now out of Egypt, long ago, the Israelites were led by a mighty miracle. They [music and singing] were all kept and fed through the Red Sea. They were brought. The waters [music] stood apart. And God gave Sister Miriam a dance in her heart. There was [music] a celebration upon the red sea shore. Timberl desert [music] sand became a dancing floor. [singing] The people sang and praised God there. He made gloom depart. [music] He put a dance of love and joy deep down in their heart. Oh, the Holy Ghost will [music] set your feet to dancing. Hallelujah. The Holy dancing and set your heart and dancing [music] too. Well, the prodigal was far away wondering out in sin. [music] But he came back to father's house. Father took him in. He put a robe upon his son. A very near immen. [music] That old prodal got dancing beat to match his dancing heart. The Holy Ghost [music] will set your feet a dancing. Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost will thrill you through and through. The Holy Ghost [music] will set your feet a dancing. Set your heart a dancing too. Well, now many saints are cold and bound [music] by unbelief today. They say they want the blessings of the Lord, but worry what men may say. Let the Lord have full control. [music] Dead traditions part. God will set you free within. Go get a dancing [music] heart. Oh, the Holy Ghost will set your feet a dancing. The Holy Ghost will th [music] you in the room. The Holy Ghost will set your feet a dancing. [music] One more time. The prodigal was far away, wandering out in sin. He came back to father's [music] house. Father took him in. He put a robe upon his son. The merry man did star. [music] That prodigal got dancing deep to match his dancing heart. The other verse goes with that. The father's [music] house with music rang to welcome home the son. The heart like all the [music] others there. Wo! The Holy Ghost will set your feet to dancing. Woo! The Holy Ghost will [music] set your feet to dancing and set your heart a dancing too. Well, now many saints are [music] cold and bound by unbelief today. They say they want the blessings of the Lord, but worry what men may say. Just let the Lord have full control. Dead tradition part and God will [music] set you free within. You'll have an answer. Now, Sister Martha, the ne the other part, the other part of that verse. Now in the Bible we can read that in the latter days men would leave their first love and turn to carnal ways. But trueborn saints [music] of Jesus for the bridegroom set apart watching for his coming with a joyful [music] dancing heart. Oh the Holy Ghost will set your feet a dancing. The Holy Ghost will reel you through and through. The Holy Ghost will set your feet a dancing. [music] Set your heart of dancing. Set your heart of dancing. Set your heart of dancing [music] too. Glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. Have a wonderful Thanksgiving. and uh you're dismissed to go. Thank you for indulging us. You'll have a grandbaby one day and you'll want to do it too. [snorts] Or two or three or 10 or 12. God bless you all. Thank you for being here today. Pray for those who couldn't be here. God bless you. Please continue to pray for Sister Flo and her family. I don't know anything about arrangements, but when we hear, we'll let you know. I bless you.
