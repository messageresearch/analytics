[0:16] they shall smile reasonable
[0:30] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[0:33] Shelley and you're watching the Eagles
[0:35] cry I welcome you to the broadcast today
[0:39] and I hope that something has been said
[0:41] in a previous broadcast that's
[0:44] encouraged you to go on to keep on
[0:47] keepin on for the King of Kings and the
[0:49] Lord of lords Jesus Christ Yeshua our
[0:52] Messiah and if this is the first time
[0:55] that you've seen the Eagles cry then I
[0:58] pray that something will be said today
[1:01] that will be a help or an encouragement
[1:04] to you in your life I want you to know
[1:06] the whole theme of this ministry as
[1:08] Hebrews 13 and 8 Jesus Christ the same
[1:12] yesterday and today and forever you see
[1:15] I just simply believe that Jesus is
[1:19] exactly today what he was yesterday and
[1:22] tomorrow he's going to be exactly the
[1:25] same he changes not his word is true
[1:28] what he was able to do to perform on the
[1:32] shores of Galilee 2,000 years ago I
[1:35] believe he's able to do that and even
[1:39] greater you say well how could he do
[1:42] greater because he tells us in his word
[1:45] that greater works than this shall you
[1:48] do those who follow his disciples the
[1:52] believers those who trust in his saving
[1:55] and keeping power and I'm glad to say
[1:58] I'm one of them I realized that this
[2:01] program goes into places where there are
[2:04] many cultures many religions many faiths
[2:07] and I honor you where you are I honor
[2:11] you and thank you for watching this
[2:13] program but I want to I just have to
[2:16] submit to you with all love and respect
[2:18] I have to share with you the faith
[2:21] that's in my heart and that is that
[2:23] Jesus Christ Yeshua is the only way I
[2:26] really believe that he has come into
[2:30] this world to redeem us back to our
[2:33] Father back to where it was that we
[2:36] should be in the mind of God
[2:38] way back from the foundation of the
[2:40] world
[2:41] old I believe God had a plan and that
[2:43] plan is being carried out in our lives
[2:47] in this hour so I just want to encourage
[2:49] you dig dig a little deeper if you don't
[2:52] know the Lord Jesus if you don't follow
[2:55] him I'm not advertising the church the
[2:58] church because the church is full of men
[3:00] and women the church is flawed so I'm
[3:03] not here trying to present to you that
[3:05] the church is perfect but I'll tell you
[3:07] our Savior is perfect and he is working
[3:10] a work of perfection in those of us who
[3:14] follow him closely by the leadership of
[3:17] the Holy Spirit and so I just want to
[3:19] encourage you to dig a little bit pray a
[3:20] little bit read a little bit and see if
[3:23] perhaps the light of the gospel will
[3:26] shine into your life and give you joy
[3:28] and then I know that there are
[3:30] multitudes of people who follow the Lord
[3:32] Jesus and watch this program and I want
[3:35] to be able to encourage you too because
[3:37] we're coming in as the body of Christ as
[3:40] the bride of Messiah we're coming in to
[3:43] the greatest days of our lives our
[3:45] ministries our callings our destinies oh
[3:49] we're being launched I believe that with
[3:52] every fiber of my being so I welcome you
[3:55] again to this program and I want to
[3:57] encourage you to visit our website its
[3:59] revival dot o-r-g there's lots of
[4:02] wonderful resources available to you to
[4:05] bless you to equip you to encourage you
[4:08] on your journey for the Lord at our
[4:10] website you can also send us a letter or
[4:13] even phone call your prayer request in
[4:17] and we'll be more than happy to pray
[4:18] with you I believe in the power of
[4:20] prayer I believe in the power of
[4:21] agreement and it's my joy to agree with
[4:25] you over your requests just be faithful
[4:28] and let us know when the answer comes
[4:30] we're getting praise reports already
[4:33] some have been remarkable about how God
[4:36] is healed and how God is delivered and
[4:38] so if you send in a prayer request and
[4:41] God moves let us know what's happening
[4:43] we want to share if we share with your
[4:46] burden we want to share with your joy
[4:47] amen and so stay in touch with us and if
[4:52] God should lay on your heart to partner
[4:54] with us
[4:54] financially on a monthly basis to help
[4:57] us continue to do what we're doing and
[4:59] expand then there are many ways that you
[5:02] can do that and one of them the easiest
[5:04] one perhaps is through the website so
[5:06] you can go there and find out about our
[5:08] partner link and how that works but I
[5:12] want to get right into the Word of God
[5:13] today we're in a little series that
[5:16] we're in titling from obscurity to
[5:19] visibility alright and we're in I say a
[5:21] chapter 58 and I'm not going to go back
[5:24] and read all the previous verses that
[5:26] we've read and enjoyed all along the way
[5:29] to get us to where we are today but I
[5:31] will read verse 10 and verse 11 I think
[5:36] we were moving into 10 and 11 the last
[5:39] time we were together I say a 58 and 10
[5:42] and if thou wilt and if thou draw out
[5:45] thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the
[5:49] afflicted soul then shall thy light rise
[5:53] in obscurity and thy darkness be as the
[5:58] noonday hey something's going on there's
[6:01] a transformation in this promise and I
[6:05] think one of the most important keys to
[6:08] what God is saying here through the
[6:09] Prophet I say is very simply stated
[6:13] bloom where you're planted use the
[6:16] authority that God has given you in the
[6:18] arena in the area where you've been
[6:21] called the minister use that to the
[6:23] fullest it's like God said to Moses hey
[6:27] what is that in your hand and and more
[6:30] it's a rod Moses said it's a rod and God
[6:34] said that's exactly what I'm going to
[6:37] use to deliver my people and so I
[6:39] believe essentially that God has already
[6:42] sewn into us planted in us what we need
[6:46] the equipment that we're going to need
[6:48] to spiritually fulfill and walk out our
[6:52] destiny it's in us but sometimes we're
[6:55] hoping and believing for the greater
[6:57] things and we step right over the
[7:00] present will of God the will of God for
[7:02] today in our lives what would God have
[7:05] you to do
[7:06] now what is he called you to do now what
[7:09] doors has he opened for you
[7:11] now be faithful in those doors be
[7:14] faithful in that level of ministry and
[7:16] then believe God for expansion I believe
[7:19] it's very important to be faithful
[7:21] because he says that if we are faithful
[7:24] over the few things he's going to make
[7:27] us ruler he's going to give us dominion
[7:29] over many things Chuck Pierce who is a
[7:33] prophetic voice in America has described
[7:37] this new year on the Jewish calendar
[7:40] we're already there now 57 68 and as
[7:44] we're in this year he said that one of
[7:47] the spiritual significant truths 457 68
[7:53] is the word Dominion God wants to bring
[7:57] his people into a new level of authority
[8:00] and Dominion and somebody said dominion
[8:03] over what well we need to take authority
[8:05] and dominion over the Prince of the
[8:07] power of the air over demonic spirits in
[8:10] the second heaven we need to come
[8:12] against by the authority of Jesus Christ
[8:16] the oppressive demonic spirits of Hell
[8:19] that are holding back our loved ones
[8:22] that are attacking and controlling our
[8:24] neighbors I mean we need to be able to
[8:26] stand in the authority of God speak the
[8:28] word amen and watch God perform his
[8:33] promise hey God has never given us a
[8:37] reason to think that he will not be
[8:39] faithful in fact the the opposite is
[8:42] true God's track record is perfect it's
[8:47] absolutely perfect everything he said he
[8:50] was going to do he has done so we have
[8:52] no reason to doubt that he's going to do
[8:55] the things yet in the future that he has
[8:58] promised so let's do what we can now
[9:01] while we are believing God for even
[9:04] bigger and greater things I like this
[9:07] phrase then shall thy light rise in
[9:13] obscurity now that word obscurity is an
[9:16] interesting word in the Hebrew language
[9:18] it
[9:19] means a lack of clearness a lack of
[9:23] clarity we're talking about something
[9:26] that's a little bit fuzzy or a little
[9:28] bit blurry do you understand what I mean
[9:31] something that is a little bit difficult
[9:35] to be understood it also means the
[9:40] condition of being unknown if something
[9:43] is obscure it's unknown if someone is
[9:46] obscure they're relatively unknown it
[9:51] also can mean a little-known person or
[9:53] place it can also mean darkness or shade
[9:57] so God says I'm going to let your light
[9:59] rise in obscurity so there's many many
[10:03] spiritual applications using the root
[10:07] meaning of that word obscurity if God
[10:11] says I'm gonna let your light rise in
[10:14] obscurity let's go back and make sure of
[10:17] how its worded then shall thy light rise
[10:21] in obscurity then what is God saying
[10:24] well one thing he's saying is you have
[10:27] had a lack of clarity and I know that
[10:32] that has been true in my own spiritual
[10:34] life there have been times that the
[10:37] words on the page were blurry so to
[10:39] speak I couldn't quite discern the mind
[10:43] of God I couldn't quite discern the will
[10:46] the perfect will of God now I know this
[10:51] is old teaching but it's still right God
[10:54] has a perfect will and plan the highest
[10:58] order is God's perfect will but he asks
[11:03] what we have come to call a permissive
[11:05] will he will sometimes allow us to do
[11:09] certain things that may not have been in
[11:13] his original plan for us but he loves us
[11:17] and we therefore find ourselves in the
[11:20] permitted wheel or the permissive will
[11:23] of God God is allowing it but I find out
[11:27] have found out and continue to find out
[11:30] that the highest blessing
[11:33] it's not in being in God's permissive
[11:35] will or what he will permit me or allow
[11:37] me to do but if I am expecting and
[11:40] believing for the highest blessing the
[11:44] highest level of anointing and authority
[11:46] then I need to contend I need to do to
[11:51] fight for the perfect will of God the
[11:55] perfect mind of God and so one of the
[11:58] promises that I'm claiming in this new
[12:01] season of the Lord is that the
[12:03] blurriness of my understanding that it
[12:07] would become clear that there would be
[12:08] no issue with hearing the clear voice of
[12:13] God is that also your desire I think it
[12:16] is I think we can claim the promise of
[12:19] the Old Testament where the prophet of
[12:21] God said that there should be a we let
[12:24] it let our clarity be like this that
[12:26] that we could hear a voice behind us
[12:29] saying this is the way walk ye in it now
[12:35] I don't mean to sound dumb but I feel
[12:37] sometimes like I really need God to draw
[12:42] it out very plain hey you this is the
[12:45] way to walk get in it this is what I
[12:47] would have you to do get in it and okay
[12:51] that's alright you know I don't mind
[12:54] confessing to you that I need some time
[12:56] but the leadership to be that clear my
[13:00] understanding can get blurry and
[13:03] especially if we if we don't spend
[13:07] enough time developing our devotional
[13:09] life if we're not praying enough if
[13:12] we're not feeding our spirit man enough
[13:15] on the Word of God you see a lot of
[13:17] times we feed our soul the soulish part
[13:20] of man but we're not feeding the
[13:22] spiritual part of man and so at the
[13:26] deepest level you are a spirit man and
[13:28] that spirit man has to be fed and if
[13:33] we're not doing that then our life is
[13:35] suffering devotionally our spirit is
[13:39] suffering and so it can become
[13:41] increasingly more difficult to have a
[13:45] clear word
[13:46] from the Lord so we need to hone in we
[13:50] need to sharpen up our skills and we
[13:53] need to present ourselves to the Lord
[13:55] and then we can stand on this word and
[13:57] say hey Lord I need my light to rise in
[14:00] obscurity
[14:01] I need more clearness I want to get rid
[14:04] of this difficulty in being able to
[14:07] understand what you're trying to show me
[14:10] in your word or what you're trying to
[14:12] reveal to me about my next step what you
[14:16] would have me to do I need the divine
[14:19] clear plain leadership of the Lord and
[14:22] let's face it sometimes he speaks like a
[14:25] trumpet but other times he speaks in a
[14:28] still small voice I want and I believe
[14:30] that's also your desire to have enough
[14:33] sensitivity in the spirit that we can
[14:36] discern not only the trumpet voice of
[14:39] God but that we can also know and have
[14:43] grace to obey the still small voice of
[14:46] God also I believe this condition of
[14:49] being unknown I believe that the
[14:52] greatest players in this next move of
[14:56] God the the you know I hate to say it
[14:59] that way I hate to say the greatest
[15:00] vessels are the greatest instruments
[15:02] because we need to understand there are
[15:04] no big eyes and little use in the
[15:08] kingdom of God you know sometimes we
[15:10] think oh there's a few chief people a
[15:12] few key and there are often times key
[15:16] men and women that God uses for specific
[15:19] purposes but we all have greatness in us
[15:23] because we have Jesus in us when you
[15:25] have the Holy Spirit in you you have the
[15:27] spirit of excellence and you have the
[15:29] spirit of greatness and we want to
[15:31] develop that and the way to develop this
[15:34] in in our lives the way to develop
[15:37] greatness the way to develop excellence
[15:40] is through obedience by obeying him and
[15:43] remember we want to obey Him in the
[15:46] little things we want to be sensitive to
[15:49] obey in the little things so that we can
[15:52] be trusted even with the bigger things
[15:55] what I believe God's going to do though
[15:57] is he's going to bring
[16:00] unknown men and women yo Bob Jones who
[16:03] is also great prophetic voice in America
[16:05] had a visitation I've I think I've
[16:08] referred to it before here on the Eagles
[16:10] cry where he had a visitation from a
[16:13] group of angels one of the Angels the
[16:17] the most significant of the angel as far
[16:20] as the one who spoke was breakthrough
[16:23] and he had this great visitation but the
[16:27] rest of these guys I think maybe there
[16:29] were 11 other angelic beings that came
[16:31] to him in this visitation and they would
[16:34] have hardly been recognized as angels
[16:37] they were dressed in ordinary street
[16:39] clothes slightly different styles
[16:41] different body you know some big some
[16:46] small some tall skinny fat whatever
[16:49] short and that was one of the things
[16:52] that was spiritually significant in this
[16:54] visitation was they were ordinary how
[16:57] ordinary they were God is about to use
[17:01] ordinary people in a very unordinary way
[17:07] he's about to use some very natural
[17:10] people in a very supernatural way that's
[17:13] God it's not only God it's his track
[17:16] record I mean you look at the men and
[17:19] women that we would call heroes of the
[17:21] Bible or heroes of the revivals of the
[17:24] past centuries and they were very
[17:27] ordinary men and women I mean their
[17:30] lives were simple and poor and
[17:32] uneducated in most cases until God
[17:35] elevated them so don't give up on the
[17:38] fact that God is going to do great
[17:41] things in your life because we're going
[17:43] to experience new seasons of
[17:47] acceleration and elevation we're going
[17:50] to see God bringing us out of this place
[17:55] of obscurity he's kind of hidden a lot
[17:58] of people he's hidden a lot of people in
[18:00] the cocoon like the caterpillar he's
[18:04] hidden a lot of people in that cocoon so
[18:07] that he could transform us by the spirit
[18:10] of change and you know change is not
[18:13] comfort
[18:13] say men change it's not comfortable but
[18:17] that's what God sins change for to make
[18:21] us uncomfortable to move us out of our
[18:26] present comfort zone to stretch us you
[18:29] know what I've been saying about
[18:31] stretching God stretching us lately
[18:33] that's a good thing because the the
[18:35] bigger he stretches us the it increases
[18:39] our capacity for him and if I'm going to
[18:42] be stretched to a big vessel I wanna I
[18:45] want to be big enough to contain more of
[18:47] God that's what we're after that's what
[18:50] we're hungry for more of you Lord more
[18:53] of your spirit more of your leadership
[18:55] and so this great change this
[18:58] metamorphosis that's taking place
[19:00] there's a lot in this phrase then shall
[19:03] your light rise in obscurity
[19:05] God says I'm not only going to give you
[19:07] a clearness I'm gonna take away some of
[19:09] that difficulty that you have had in
[19:11] understanding my voice and in
[19:14] understanding my will but I'm also going
[19:16] to take you from that little unknown
[19:18] secret place and I'm gonna launch you
[19:21] forth into your community into your
[19:24] nation into the world to do something
[19:27] for me I'm gonna bring you out of the
[19:31] shadows and into the light because
[19:35] there's an unveiling remember the
[19:37] experience I think we shared with you
[19:39] that God gave me some months ago and the
[19:42] final announcement that was given as I
[19:45] saw all of this beautiful fruit coming
[19:48] quickly to maturity it started off as
[19:50] just a sort of a bear and piece of land
[19:54] but immediately after it had had risen
[19:57] up out of the of the ocean what looked
[20:00] like the ocean I saw little blades of
[20:02] grass and then quickly I saw shrubs and
[20:05] then trees appear and then very very
[20:07] quickly leaves and blooms and fruit buds
[20:11] and fruit luscious mature fruit and I
[20:15] said what is this and the voice said
[20:18] this is the revealing of the sons of the
[20:21] kingdom God said I'm getting ready to
[20:25] reveal my sons
[20:27] getting ready hallelujah to bring my
[20:30] son's out of obscurity into visibility
[20:35] I'm going to show this old wicked world
[20:39] what I meaning the Spirit of Truth the
[20:42] Spirit of God what I can accomplish
[20:44] through my sons and when we say sons we
[20:49] mean sons and daughters because this
[20:50] thing that we're talking about now is
[20:52] genderless and it goes back to that
[20:55] age-old thing we preach a lot about the
[20:57] sons of God the sons of the kingdom we
[20:59] preach a lot about the Bride of Christ
[21:01] and women may struggle just as much
[21:04] being a son of God as men may struggle
[21:07] being a Bride of Christ and the fact of
[21:09] the matter is we need to quit struggling
[21:10] about all of it because if God says I'm
[21:13] gonna be his bride I'm ready
[21:15] I want that and if God says I'm gonna be
[21:17] a son and my wife is gonna be a son of
[21:20] God then she desires that that's what
[21:22] she wants so you know when I'm preaching
[21:25] on the bridal message I often say to the
[21:27] brothers you you know you need to lay
[21:29] down some of your ego and and this
[21:31] overly macho thing that you got going on
[21:34] where you struggle with the concept of
[21:36] being with the Lord Jesus being his
[21:39] bride being his wife because the Bible
[21:41] talks about the Lambs wife and how she
[21:43] has made herself ready
[21:45] don't trip yourself on vocabulary just
[21:49] get in there and ask the Lord to let it
[21:51] manifest in you amen a lot of people
[21:54] trip over the trappings they trip over
[21:57] the vocabulary and what we need to be
[21:59] doing is we need to be on our faces
[22:01] before God saying lord help me to come
[22:03] into that place where I can manifest
[22:06] that I'm your son help me to come into
[22:08] that place where I can bring forth the
[22:11] manifestation and the proof and the
[22:13] token that I am your bride that I have
[22:16] been with you in the Hupa in the Holy of
[22:19] Holies in the secret chamber the bridal
[22:22] chamber of the Lord we want to be able
[22:25] to come forth with the character of
[22:28] Jesus Christ and so don't stumble over
[22:32] vocabulary get in there and get what you
[22:36] can okay God said I'm going to let your
[22:39] light rise and
[22:40] obscurity and your darkness be as the
[22:43] noonday Oh some years ago God just spoke
[22:46] very sweetly very plainly in our
[22:49] ministry and he said I'm gonna bring you
[22:51] from obscurity to visibility so that's
[22:54] when I started pondering on these
[22:55] scriptures looking up these definitions
[22:57] so we know what obscurity means they
[22:59] mean I think I have enough time I can
[23:01] read it again a lack of clarity or
[23:03] clearness difficulty in being understood
[23:06] and you know that works both ways
[23:07] because we want God we want to be able
[23:12] to understand what God is saying we want
[23:14] to be able to understand his voice we
[23:16] want to be able to discern his will but
[23:18] also the enemy wants to muscle us he
[23:22] wants to tie our tongue and he wants us
[23:26] not to be able to articulate and to
[23:28] express you know that's one of the
[23:30] weaknesses of my life that I have before
[23:32] the Lord often I often come to the Lord
[23:35] and say Lord I lay before you my
[23:37] inability to express what you give me I
[23:41] know what you give me is right I know
[23:43] what you give me is real and I know it's
[23:45] powerful but I feel sometimes so
[23:47] inadequate in so weak in having the
[23:50] gifting to be able to express it and to
[23:53] articulate it so this word is big if God
[23:56] says I'm gonna bring you from obscurity
[23:58] to visibility he's not only saying I'm
[24:00] gonna give you a greater understanding
[24:02] to know my voice to know my will but
[24:05] perhaps he's also saying I'm gonna give
[24:07] you a greater anointing and a greater
[24:09] gifting to express with clarity what I'm
[24:13] giving you
[24:14] oh I like that I claim that one I need
[24:17] that one and perhaps you're listening
[24:18] and you need that one as well and then
[24:21] also it means the condition of being
[24:24] unknown or relatively unknown a place or
[24:26] even a person who is sort of in the
[24:29] shadow or in the darkness and God said
[24:31] I'm gonna bring I've got some real
[24:33] champions Oh hallelujah my fealty
[24:35] anointing I've got some real dread
[24:38] champions that I've been working on
[24:40] behind the veil underneath the covering
[24:43] in the secret chamber in the closet I've
[24:46] been working on some real dread
[24:47] champions and I'm getting ready
[24:49] hallelujah to open the door and kick
[24:52] them out I'm gonna push them
[24:54] fourth I'm going to launch them as
[24:57] forerunners hallelujah to establish the
[25:01] kingdom of Jesus Christ in the earth
[25:03] what are they going to do they're going
[25:05] to give sight to the blind they're going
[25:07] to raise the dead they're going to
[25:09] cleanse the lepers they're going to cost
[25:11] the lame to get up and walk again
[25:13] they're going to speak words of
[25:14] deliverance that will set the captives
[25:16] free break every heavy yoke and every
[25:19] burden the dread champions of the Lord
[25:22] are arising the sons of the kingdom are
[25:25] arising this Bridal company is arising
[25:28] this company of doves this company of
[25:30] eagles all of this spiritual vocabulary
[25:34] that God's been sending in this hour to
[25:37] help us to express to us what he wants
[25:41] to do through us and before you can do
[25:43] anything through us we have to let him
[25:45] do some big stuff in us now in closing
[25:48] the definition of visibility is the
[25:51] condition or quality of being distinct
[25:55] distinguishable visible the capability
[25:58] of being seen so God said I'm gonna
[26:00] bring you out into a into a spotlight
[26:04] now don't let that go to your head and
[26:06] get puffed up with pride and get
[26:08] boastful that's not what God's saying
[26:09] he's just saying what I'm doing for you
[26:12] in secret what I'm doing for you in your
[26:15] prayer time what I'm doing for you
[26:17] behind the scenes and you feel so
[26:19] discouraged sometime because you haven't
[26:21] accomplished as much as you'd like to
[26:23] accomplish in ministry everything you've
[26:26] been going through from the day you were
[26:29] born until now was preparation God is
[26:33] preparing us Oh hallelujah
[26:36] he's preparing us building us shaping us
[26:40] molding us making us to the image
[26:44] conforming us to His image so that we
[26:48] can go forth work the works of God
[26:52] get this thing done get it over with
[26:55] and go home I mean who loves this world
[26:59] enough to want to stick around here for
[27:01] any period of time we want to get out of
[27:03] this old pest house we want to get home
[27:06] we want to go back to our heavenly home
[27:08] we want to go back to the place that God
[27:10] has created for us in the beginning but
[27:12] before we do that we got to get some
[27:13] work done
[27:14] so I'm asking the Lord right now to
[27:17] anoint you to see clearly to hear
[27:21] clearly to articulate clearly I'm asking
[27:25] the Lord to accelerate the bringing you
[27:28] forth to bring you forth out of the
[27:31] darkness out of obscurity into
[27:33] visibility into the light and Lord we
[27:36] just ask for a release of maturity on
[27:39] the body of Christ let us grow up
[27:40] quickly because we know that we're not
[27:43] yet to that stature where you've called
[27:46] us to be so help us Lord to grow up
[27:48] quickly and we release healing because
[27:50] we know healing is the children's bread
[27:52] so father right now just touch your
[27:54] people in the name of Yeshua the Lord
[27:56] Jesus Christ we pray amen any man we
[27:59] love you contact us if you get the
[28:01] chance thank you for watching and I hope
[28:03] you'll tune in again to the Eagles cry
[28:05] god bless you bye bye for now
[28:38] you
