[Applause] Sister Audrey, I'm glad that you're here today. Brother Gregory, I'm glad that you're here with your family today. I'm glad to be in the house of the Lord with saints of like precious faith. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I know that he is on every case. He is ministering to us. He is helping us. And we're glad that he is in the house. Brother Austin and Sister Anna Hodes, they tell me that you all have a song special for us today. We're going to worship with you as we receive the tithe and offering. We want to give as giving unto the Lord while they're coming and getting ready. I'm going to give you an exhortation of a of a small revelation I saw this week that I think might help you. So, we're giving of our tithe unto the Lord. It belongs to him. And when you read Deuteronomy chapter 14, you see at the beginning of the chapter the the laws of clean and unclean food of which I believe is the only ones that can be sanctified by the word of God and by prayer. I believe that you take it to the Lord for yourself. But later in that chapter, it talks about a a tithe. And because that I didn't understand it, I decided to dig into it a little deeper. I haven't dug all that deep, but it appears that it is a second tithe. It is a tithe out of the 9/10 that is left over after we give God our 10% that belongs to him to start with. And in that second tithe, it is that you bring a tenth of your crop, uh the increase of the seed. And the scripture says that if it is too far to carry that food with you that you are able to cash that in for coin and go to the place where God puts his name &gt;&gt; and buy it all over again, whatever you crave. Yes. &gt;&gt; If you're hungry for a steak, you were able to buy a steak as long as it was according to what God had put in the law. So as you ladies are preparing food and as you men are buying the food this week, I want you to just think about this that we are coming to the place where God has chosen to put his name and we are taking that that God has given us and we're sharing it with saints of like precious faith. We're sharing it together. It is a tithe unto the Lord. We give it gladly because he has blessed us uh to be able to do it. We're so thankful for all of his provision and we share it with God's people. And if you want New Testament scripture when Jesus was asked, "What is the greatest of all the commandments?" And he said, "To love the Lord God with all your heart, your soul, your mind, with everything that's within you, and to love your neighbor &gt;&gt; as yourself." And so it's a part of putting down the self, the selfishness and the selfish nature as we bring together this week and we enjoy some fellowship and food after the services. We're coming for spiritual food in due season. Brother Ellias, Brother Austin, will you come and get the offering bag and go to the people as we give our tithe and offering to the Lord, what belongs to him for the priesthood. That is God's command and we do it gladly because he has blessed us. Let's worship together as brother Austin and sister Anna sing today. &gt;&gt; Blessed Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus blinded all my darkness. He sparked my heart within. His grace and mercy lit a passion consume my sin. Now like a city on a hilltop, I'll shine through the night. I am a lamp made for his glory. I will not hide. I've been touched by a fire. So let the world come and watch me burn. Shout it from the rooftops. Shout it till everyone has heard. This love will never be extinguished. &gt;&gt; It's alive and wild and free. I'm overtaken by his power. His spirit in me. His spirit in me. His spirit in me. I've been touched by a fire. So let the world come and watch me burn. I'll shout it from the rooftop. Shout it till everyone has heard. Jesus has changed my life. His name be lifted high. This holy fire is burning inside of me. Jesus has changed my life. His name be lifted high. This holy fire is burning inside of me. &gt;&gt; I cannot hold it inside. I cannot keep it quiet. This holy fire is burning inside of me. I cannot hold it inside. I cannot keep it quiet. This holy fire is burning inside of me. I've been touched by a fire. So let the world come and watch me burn. [Music] Shout it from the rooftop. Shout it till everyone has heard. I've been touched by a fire. So let the world come and watch me burn. Shout it from the rooftops. Shout it till everyone has heard. I cannot hold it inside. I cannot keep it quiet. This holy fire is burning inside of me. I cannot hold it inside. I cannot keep it quiet. This holy fire is burning inside of me. I've been touched by a fire. So let the world come and watch me burn. I'll shout it from the rooftops. Shout it till everyone has heard. &gt;&gt; Yes, I've been touched by a fire. So let the world come and watch me burn. Oh, shouting from the rooftops. Shouting till everyone has heard. Thank you Jesus for the blood applied. Thank you Jesus. It has washed me white. Thank you Jesus. It has changed my life. brought me from the darkness into glorious light. &gt;&gt; There is nothing stronger than the wonder working power of the blood. The blood that causes sons and daughters. We are ransom by the father through the blood. [Music] There is nothing stronger than the wonder working power of love. that calls the sons and daughters. We are ransom the blood. The blood. Thank you Jesus for the blood of life. Thank you Jesus. It has washed me white. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. It has changed my life. &gt;&gt; Brought me from the darkness into glorious light. [Music] Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for the washing of the water of the word, the blood of Jesus Christ that cleanses us from all of our sin, all of our unrighteousness? &gt;&gt; It doesn't just cover it, it cleanses it. &gt;&gt; It washes it away. And we have been called sons and daughters. We don't have to come to him as beggars. &gt;&gt; I am so thankful for this message of truth that God has given to us to help us to understand who we are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Would you stand with us as we are getting our hearts continually ready for the word? I'd like to sing the yawn brother's song. I just want to thank you, Lord, for letting me hear your word. What have I done &gt;&gt; to deserve such glory that's revealed in me? [Music] Thank you, Lord, for that special night. I still remember it. I haven't forgotten what the Lord did then, but I'm glad that he didn't quit his working upon me. &gt;&gt; He continually gives revelation upon revelation, understanding upon understanding. He is continually unfolding himself to us so that when we look in the mirror, &gt;&gt; That's right. We're not seeing us. &gt;&gt; We're seeing him. And I just want to thank you, Lord, [Music] for letting me hear your word. What have I done to deserve the glory revealed in me? Thanks for that special night when I saw the glorious light. Came face to face with eternal life. And Lord, I thank thee. And I just want to thank you, Lord, for letting me hear your word. What have I done to deserve the glory revealed in me? Thanks for that special night when I saw your glorious life. came face to face with eternal life. And Lord, I &gt;&gt; say again, I want to thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And I just want to thank you, Lord, &gt;&gt; for letting me hear your word. What have I done to deserve such glory revealed in me? Thanks for that special night when I saw your glorious light. Came face to face with eternal life. And Lord, I thank thee you didn't have to open my eyes. You could have easily pass me by. For the age I was living in was helpless, poor and blind. Oh, but I heard recognizing your name. I heard the serpent seed and perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Oh, the preach and the message of grace. And Lord, I thank thee. Sing again. And I just want to thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord, for letting me hear your word. What have I done? [Music] Such glory. [Music] Thanks for Thanks for that special night when I saw your glorious light. Came face to face with eternal life. And Lord, I thank thee. Why don't you just lift your hand? Thank the Lord for Isab. Would you do that right now? &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; we thank you &gt;&gt; for the grease. We thank you for the eyes &gt;&gt; that has opened our eyes &gt;&gt; to see the reality of your word. &gt;&gt; We thank you that it's not a million miles away. &gt;&gt; The word stands even in this room, &gt;&gt; personified and fleshed out &gt;&gt; in a people prepared for the end time. a people called out among the nations, among the Gentiles for the name of the Lord. Lord, we don't take that lightly. We take it seriously. And soberly. May you continue. There are some who believe they've seen it all. I'm not one of those. I still believe that you're unfolding and unveiling yourself &gt;&gt; and you're causing this revelation to to go deeper &gt;&gt; into the hearts and lives of your children. &gt;&gt; So Lord, grant it that it would be for all of us today. &gt;&gt; We'll give you praise. We'll give you honor. We'll give you glory. Would you just clap your hands for the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords? Praise God. He's wonderful and worthy. He's so worthy. Praise God. You may be seated. He's wonderful and worthy to be praised. &gt;&gt; He deserves the highest praise. You know, I I had a hard time. Uh I I've never heard that so so so so so so good song. And I had a hard time getting it all in, but I did it. I did it. Um it was good. And I was thinking about Brother Steven over there. He ought singing the loudest. So so so so good. Because uh I think the Lord spared your life. Don't you? Amen. Slow down. quit giving the angels such a hard work. You you you're making it hard on them. But he really I from what I could see, I haven't spoken to him, but from what I could see, he could have left here, left a family to grieve. And I'm so thankful for the angels of the Lord that bared, bore him up, held him up. He didn't look like he'd been held up, but uh but he had been &gt;&gt; and God has spared him. and they're back traveling and doing good. Good to see you. All of you. All of you. All of you that are here. We have so much to thank him for. &gt;&gt; We could never thank him enough. &gt;&gt; Now, there's just a little bit of confusion in the house. Do you believe God's given us authority over it? &gt;&gt; I don't know who brought it, but I wished you would have left it at home. &gt;&gt; You know, you may be used to living in confusion. I'm not. I I can't take that that element of confusion. It's it's it's certainly Antichrist. It's certainly not of God. And there are certain uh personality types that kind of thrive in that environment. I'm not one of them. And uh you know the word Babel uh for the tower there is also the word where we get Babylon. And as their speech was confused at the tower because the these uh smart elks, they thought we're going to we're going to build a tower so high and show God that he's he he's not so great after all. We can we can just march right up to where he is. And that same spirit carries throughout the entire scripture. started in the garden and it carries all the way through into Babylon. And there is so much confusion in Babylon. And that's why I've always been so blessed to read that there was a church according to the book of Acts. There was a church in Babylon. &gt;&gt; I greet you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And I said if if if they can have a Holy Ghost book of Acts church in Babylon, We ought to be able to have one in Alabama. &gt;&gt; And you ought to be able to have one wherever you are. &gt;&gt; And there's a remedy for confusion. &gt;&gt; There's a remedy for it. The Bible says they that they that uh that trust him and put their hope in him, he said he would keep our minds. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in order for him to keep our minds, that means he settles all of the other stuff. the swirl. I I call it swirl because you feel it sometime. And uh I want us just to to as we get ready to go to the word, I want you to know you don't have to sit there in the swirl if it's trying to to get on you. I know I use language that's strange to some folks. I just describe it like I feel it, like I experience it. Uh but great peace have they which love the law, the instruction of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. and nothing shall by any means &gt;&gt; confuse or confound them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said he would keep us. And I believe he will. Now, we're getting ready to enter into a a meeting this week. I think we've entered into it today. And if you think the devil's going to lay down and play dead and let you get a good blessing in this meeting, &gt;&gt; oh, he's not going to roll over and play dead for anybody. He's going to wiggle. He's going to swish his tail. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; He's going to try to squeeze &gt;&gt; like a python &gt;&gt; and twist like Leviathan, &gt;&gt; but he's defeated. &gt;&gt; My Lord knows how to take the dragon by the tail. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Satan like a roaring as a roaring lion, he just roams around. Sometime I wish people would be still &gt;&gt; because when they're roaming all the time, it makes me think of the enemy. &gt;&gt; He's roaming around just looking for somebody, Jonathan, searching for somebody that he can devour. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And like I've told you before, that don't mean just gnaw on your arm. &gt;&gt; Devour means to totally consume you &gt;&gt; until there's nothing left. But greater is he that is in the earth in this bride than he that's in the world. And and if we will humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God, &gt;&gt; he said God would exalt us. He will exalt us in due time. &gt;&gt; I feel like telling you today that you shouldn't be weary in welloing &gt;&gt; for there's a harvest for you. You will reap in due season. Somebody say due season. &gt;&gt; Due season. &gt;&gt; You'll reap in due season. But here is the key. If you faint, &gt;&gt; if you faint not, you look at that word faint. It's very similar to a word that we would translate in today's English swirl. &gt;&gt; Swoon. &gt;&gt; And he if if we will faint not, swirl not, swoon not, &gt;&gt; no matter what comes or goes, &gt;&gt; we stand firm. Then we can have the authority that's promised to this little bride. It's here &gt;&gt; why don't you just put your finger right there. It is &gt;&gt; the authority because the word of God is nye. It's near you &gt;&gt; and it's even crawled in your mouth. &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture said. The word is nye even in your mouth. &gt;&gt; And uh if it's in your mouth, it's not supposed to stay there like this lozenge I've got. You're supposed to to decree it and declare it and prophesy it and speak it forward. Aren't you glad to be in the house of God today? &gt;&gt; Uh we're blessed. We're blessed. These musicians were blessed. Uh something sort of attacked Benjamin in his lower quadrant there on the left side of his stomach. He said, "I almost uh doubled over uh bent over double." And I said, "I'm not surprised. I I'm just not surprised that the enemy would would try to flop his tail around." &gt;&gt; But uh he needs to know &gt;&gt; that some of us are prayed up, &gt;&gt; fasted, prayed up, set apart, &gt;&gt; and ready to do business. Amen. &gt;&gt; For the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. Let's start today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you clap your hands for these musicians and the song leaders, song, the backup singers, the worship leader, the God's good. &gt;&gt; Today is a is John Caleb, I mean Caleb John's birthday. Uh, hold up your hand, Caleb, so everybody can see you. How old are you today? How old are you today, son? Say it again. 10. 10. That 10. I think that's what he said. Just with a little slightly different accent there. 10. That's a good age. God bless him. Tomorrow, October the 6th, is the 7th. Is it seventh anniversary for brother R.J. and sister Emily? Let's say happy anniversary to them. Kirstston, is your birthday tomorrow or this? Yeah, Monday. Do you not know? Oh, you do know. Sorry, I didn't see your head shaking. Let's see. Happy birthday to Kirsten. My daughter Olivia Zion. Stacy's daughter, too. We share her uh her birthday is on Tuesday. She turns 22 years old. That's old. Let's say happy birthday to her. Jubilee. Jubilee Miller has a birthday. He was born in 2011. How old does that make him? 14. You're turning 14. We were in Israel when you were born because we communicated with your parents when you were getting here. And uh I like your name. It's Jubel Lee. L E, but it's fun to say Jubilee. We want to wish you a happy birthday, son. Really, really do. [Music] 22 seems mighty young because Sister Isabelle Williams is having a birthday on Friday of this week and she's turning 89. 22 is a long way from 89, isn't it? We're sending our love today to Sister Williams. Uh she's asked before that we would call her Sister Isabelle. I can't quite do that, but I certainly love her and I'm looking forward, the Lord willing, to seeing her this evening. Let's uh say happy birthday to her on the stream. And then on Friday also is Lily Grayson Yovich. It's her birthday and she was born in 2018. So how old is she? 1921 23 Seven. No. Seven. Where is she? Seven. Incredible. One more time. Happy birthday to her. Let's stand. [Applause] There will be no meal after the service on Tuesday night, but every night after that, Wednesday, Thursday, of course, the banquet is Friday. There'll be an afternoon lunch on Saturday for fellowship. Uh there'll be food served after the service on Saturday night. And then next Sunday, we'll have a good uh we will close it up. And boy, by the time you cook all that food and bring it, you're going to appreciate what Brother Gley said. Just remember, you're doing that under the Lord and you're providing. I don't know where some of you have been, but I know where a lot of you have been. You've been cleaning and you've been scrubbing and you've been digging and you've been watering and you've been organizing and this place looks amazing. So, would you give yourselves a hand for all you've done to make it look so beautiful? I just happen to look down here. I don't always look. I have this here for streamers, but I just happen to look down. Of course, uh girls, your mom and dad, they're streaming uh from the Netherlands, and we're very glad about that. Brother and Sister Ryder are streaming from the airport in Cape Town. Uh or they were a little while ago on their way over. it. But Sister Sarah, uh, who I mentioned a few weeks ago, she she has just put here, "My youngest daughter wrecked her car Saturday night, and I'm very thankful she was not injured. Her car was total." We want to say, "Sister Sarah lives in Indiana, and she visited here many years ago for several times with her beautiful family and I love them very, very much." And I was so thrilled when I noticed a few few months back now that she was streaming. And I am also, sister Sarah, so thankful that God has spared your beautiful youngest daughter and giving God all the praise. He's worthy, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Matthew chap 26 and verse 29. I I uh I'm going to read the verse and then we're going to pray about that. uh any confusion that might be trying to operate on you. How do I know? Well, your mind if your mind is drifting around, the enemy is is trying to put you in that swirl. Bring your mind here. &gt;&gt; We're going to be very We're going to be very assertive this morning. I'm going to be very assertive this morning. I'm going to use a lot of authority &gt;&gt; uh because we're getting ready for a beautiful uh evening tonight and we're getting ready for a week of meetings. And I believe that as this local body uh comes together this evening and receives communion and footwashing for the first time in five years that there is something going to turn for us. &gt;&gt; And uh I I thank God we we want the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; We want all of it. &gt;&gt; All of it. And some of it is blessing and increase and multiplication. And some of it is uh some judgment for lying to the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's a big book. &gt;&gt; It's got a lot of promises. &gt;&gt; And uh there's a fire that's that's upon this little bride. And if you hadn't been under it in a while, I just encourage you to get under that fire and let him cleanse you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus, this is red letters. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my father's kingdom. Does that sound good to anybody &gt;&gt; besides me? But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my father's kingdom. Praise the Lord. Now turn to Revelation 19, just three verses. So you, if you are able, you can uh also stand. Just continue to stand just another moment. Revelation 19 verse 7-9. Let us be glad and rejoice &gt;&gt; and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come. Wasn't Jesus just talking about uh a time that he would drink again the fruit of the vine, the wine with us in his father's kingdom. And now John is speaking to us prophetically. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his &gt;&gt; wife not just a spouse, &gt;&gt; his wife. She now has his name. &gt;&gt; And in order for her to have his name, there has to have been intimacy take place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody has to to go into the tent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And intimacy has to take place. &gt;&gt; Something has to be broken. Something has to be released. And a token is to be kept to prove that the bridegroom and the bride have now become one flesh. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? And so she's no longer just engaged or espoused as we sometimes say. She now has the right to carry his name. The wife. Someone say with me, the wife. &gt;&gt; That's different than bride. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's another dimension, another step. And his wife hath made herself ready. &gt;&gt; The word is there to do it. the the the word is there to dress us and the the process and the protocol is in place. But you and I have a very important part in preparing ourselves as his wife and that is to completely participate with him in faith, yielding ourselves to the full effect of the word. &gt;&gt; It's it's a big deal. It's a big deal and we we need to see it as such. Uh, and he saith, "And and to her the wife his wife hath made herself ready, and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, which is the cloth of humility." &gt;&gt; Clean. Clean. Somebody say clean. &gt;&gt; Clean &gt;&gt; and white. &gt;&gt; Not off-white. Not beige. &gt;&gt; Naughty crew. &gt;&gt; Not tan. Right. &gt;&gt; Not a hint of rose, white, &gt;&gt; pure, without spot, without wrinkle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Made holy, not by her works, &gt;&gt; by her participation, &gt;&gt; by her yieldedness &gt;&gt; to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. For for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. You hear that, don't you? &gt;&gt; There is some righteousness in the saints. It's his shared righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you can actually put that off. You can put off his righteousness. By continuing to choose sin, &gt;&gt; by continuing to choose unbelief, you'll shed that righteousness of God. Brother, sister, I want to put it on. I want to wear his righteousness. I don't ever want to take it off. I want to be transformed on the inside of the inside because I'm wearing the fine linen of his righteousness. It has now become the possession. It has now become the inheritance &gt;&gt; of the saints. &gt;&gt; It says the saints, &gt;&gt; the righteousness of the saints. &gt;&gt; And he saith unto me, write, blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham often said wedding supper. Same thing. and he saith unto me, these are the true sayings of God. Now, I want every one of you now to come together in mind and agree with me that nothing will be able to hinder you from receiving the word of God today. Father, we are mindful in this moment that we are somewhat in an intensified battle. We recognize that you have barrels of blessings that you want to pour out upon us over the next week. And as much as we desire them, and as much as you desire to pour them out, there's an enemy. There is a dark force that would do anything and everything within its power and realm and sphere of authority to hinder us from receiving the barrels of your blessings and the total deliverance that brother Gley was speaking about. Lord, we come to you today believing that it is not more power we need. You bought all the power. You purchased all the power. You you distribute all the power. But it is an awareness of our authority. We need a bigger awareness of our authority a and whose we are &gt;&gt; in and who we belong to. And we execute a little piece of that authority right now. And we say to confusion, &gt;&gt; you are not welcome here. We command you to take your flight now in the I know the door was open and I know that you were inadvertently invited into this place but we close the door now by the blood of the lamb. We close the door and we say you cannot come back. You have no business among the saints. This is hallowed and holy ground because your spirit, your presence is here. &gt;&gt; And so we ask that clarity would come. &gt;&gt; Clarity would come in thought. Clarity would come. I take authority over every religious spirit. In the name of Jesus Christ, the spirit of hypocrisy that likes to manifest as a Pharisee. I rebuke you now in the authority of the blood, &gt;&gt; in the authority of the word, in the authority of the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; I command you to loose your hold &gt;&gt; over the minds of the saints of God. &gt;&gt; Lord, let the heavens be open over this house and may the blessings of God and the reality of your revelation become so rich and real in every one of us. Not for our credit or our glory, but for your glory. And may we be the beneficiaries of all that you accomplish. Bishma adonai Yeshua Hamashiach. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; You may be seated. We're on a whirlwind now. We have to hurry. I want to start with a quotation. I don't normally do that, but I'd like to go to a little quotation from a sermon called testimony. It was preached in 1951 in LA, and that's not Lore, Alabama. That's Los Angeles, California. In paragraph 45, the prophet of God said, "And you said, I will drink more the fruit of the vine." And we know that he's saying, "I will drink no more the fruit of the vine till I eat and drink a new with you in my father's kingdom." Didn't we just read that in Matthew 26:29? 26:29. Uh when we come there, when we come there to that great wedding supper and we look across the table, are you with me? &gt;&gt; We look across the table at one another. Oh God, just to slip a little handshake over while the tears of joy rolls down our cheeks. And as I read this this morning, sitting at my dining room table again, those tears of joy, &gt;&gt; I couldn't stop them from rolling down my cheeks. And my sanctified imagination carried me to a place not so very far away where there will be a table where there is a table &gt;&gt; spread for a million miles long. This is symbolically it meaning that the bride of every age will sit down at that table and we'll be able to look at across at one another testifying to one another how we made it over. &gt;&gt; And you know our circumstances may be different but the way we made it over is all the same. We'll all say by grace. &gt;&gt; By grace through the blood of Jesus Christ. Church, if anybody in this house makes it all the way, you'll make it by grace. You'll make it by the blood. You won't make it because you know who brother Brandham is. You'll only make it if you know Jesus in an intimate and personal way. You must have your own experience with God. He has no grandchildren. &gt;&gt; You've got to know him in the power of his resurrection. You've got to exchange your earth birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your earth birth for a new birth. &gt;&gt; That word born again means born from above. &gt;&gt; You have had an earth birth. You have been birthed here in this realm. But I want you to know that doesn't qualify you for an eternal place around the table. &gt;&gt; But there is a birth. &gt;&gt; There is a birth that qualifies you for a perpetual place in that table uh uh in the marriage supper of the lamb. Not just for a thousand years of millennial reign, but forever a in an eternity that will never end. That's the birth from above. &gt;&gt; So Lord, may we all know today before we leave this place that we have not only had an earth &gt;&gt; but that we have had a birth from above &gt;&gt; totally born again. That means that means saved by grace through the blood. It means sanctified by applying the washing of the water of the word. And it means baptized, filled to overflowing. &gt;&gt; The difference between filled and baptized &gt;&gt; is you can fill up a cup &gt;&gt; and stop at the rim &gt;&gt; and you can say, "I fill the cup." That's the earnest. &gt;&gt; But there's something more &gt;&gt; there. There's that portion that that is added that causes the cup to overflow. &gt;&gt; This is a baptism &gt;&gt; and it's part of the new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said salvation and the Holy Ghost baptism is not the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he said it requires the Holy Ghost baptism to complete. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. the new birth. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, "The Holy Ghost baptism and the new birth are not the same." &gt;&gt; But it requires a Holy Ghost baptism in order to complete the new birth. &gt;&gt; Water, blood, &gt;&gt; and then life. &gt;&gt; Spirit life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Completes the new birth. I am persuaded that there are many people who are not born again. &gt;&gt; They they've just never had a new birth &gt;&gt; and that's why they keep returning &gt;&gt; to the beggarly elements &gt;&gt; of this world. &gt;&gt; Their new birth started. The process began. Some of you are looking at me like you're not familiar with how he taught it. Well, I can help you to be familiar if need be. It's a process. &gt;&gt; In the old days when you when you didn't go back with your wife, I'd like to see some of you try to get by with that now. You you you troublemaker you. No, your wife wants you back there. She wants you to be there so that she can bite your finger or do whatever she needs to do to go through it. But in the old days, the dad sat out there in the in the waiting room with his cigars or his bubblegum cigars, and he was ready to start passing them out when the news came. &gt;&gt; But that little nurse didn't come to the door and say, "I need to tell you the water broke. I need to tell you there's a there is a flow of blood that has come forth." No. No. She didn't come and report every stage. &gt;&gt; But when that life came Oh, &gt;&gt; yeah. Yes. &gt;&gt; And if that baby didn't come here crying in those days, they put a little bit of that posterior protoplasm. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You've heard the prophet, haven't you? &gt;&gt; They slapped his little bottom and made sure that everything was all right. And his lungs were cleared. &gt;&gt; You couldn't say that now. You know that's not that's not politically correct because that would disqualify you from your tender parenting. &gt;&gt; Let's see how quiet it gets now. your your little gentle parenting uh uh uh new age &gt;&gt; psycho babble. &gt;&gt; Psycho babble. &gt;&gt; It's not even good psychology. &gt;&gt; It's psycho babble. &gt;&gt; It's anti-word even. &gt;&gt; It's confusion. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what I'm more more mad at the devil about. I'm more mad at the devil about convenient parenting. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Convenient discipline. &gt;&gt; Then I am gentle. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Because the only way to get to get through this is to be consistent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why don't you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that means you can't correct them one time for one thing because it's convenient to do so &gt;&gt; and then let them get by with it another dozen times &gt;&gt; because you got your nose stuck in Netflix. You see, you're going to square your shoulders back tonight and march up here and you're going to take a piece of that bread and you're going to take a swig of that wine and you're going to think that you've done something. But I want you to know we've done nothing. &gt;&gt; It's not our good deeds that has earned us a ride at that table. &gt;&gt; It's his grace. It's his blood. It's his work. and and we we we know how to get them here. You don't need any preaching on how to get them here, but sometimes we need a little help once we've got them here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you got your buddies over and you all are playing whatever it is you play and the and the child's the children are running like banshees, wild Indians through the house and it's not convenient to deal with them then. Listen, &gt;&gt; I'm concerned about these things. &gt;&gt; It's trending down. &gt;&gt; It's not trending up. &gt;&gt; But I can't talk about that anymore because I got notes and I need to stay on them. But boy, could I Oh my Wow. &gt;&gt; I could I'm I'm sick and tired of people not taking their own responsibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And looking at you crosseyed if you use your your authority. &gt;&gt; We got to get this thing right. &gt;&gt; I want out of here. I don't want to wait on the last boatload. &gt;&gt; I want to leave here on the first cloud. &gt;&gt; The very first shout out of here. I want to go. I want to blast right out. &gt;&gt; I don't want anything holding on to me. And I don't believe you do either. All right. Now, we come there to that great wedding supper. Uh, in other words, let me finish that. The nurse doesn't say, "Oh, the water broke. All the blood." Oh, no, no, no. But when that baby screams, "Woo!" &gt;&gt; She comes out, "You're a proud papa. You are a a dad of a bouncing baby boy." And he starts handing out his little his little gifts. There's no reason until life has come. That's right. &gt;&gt; Your new birth is not complete until you've received your own experience with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Until that happens, you will continue without total deliverance. You can't walk in total deliverance without a completed new birth. You will continue to go back to that slop pit &gt;&gt; pig pin &gt;&gt; time and time and time again until that seed lodges. &gt;&gt; It's got to get deep down. And that comes from yieldedness to the spirit and the word. And when that does, brother, there will no longer be a desire. This is what he preached. That's right. &gt;&gt; This is what he preach. There'll no longer be a desire for the things that have hooked you in the past. &gt;&gt; I know how they preach it now. They preach it to get enough guilt off of people &gt;&gt; so they'll keep coming to church, paying their tithes, &gt;&gt; taking the communion. Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And hoping &gt;&gt; hoping for a rapture. &gt;&gt; But that's not the way this message come. It didn't come to put you in a position to hope for. &gt;&gt; It put you in a position to know. So, &gt;&gt; yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to know there won't be a rapture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Without me in it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Somebody said that's pride. It is. If you say it in a prideful phariseical way, &gt;&gt; but if you say it according to the word and the message, it's nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; It's the opposite of Pentecost. It's the opposite of denominational Christianity where if you don't find your grandma, you think the rapture's taking place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, because you got this word, you can't find your loved one. You don't know what in the world has happened. But you know one thing hadn't happened. &gt;&gt; There hadn't been a rapture. How do you know? Because you're still here. &gt;&gt; That's a no-so. &gt;&gt; How many of you want to get a no? &gt;&gt; Got to have it. Got to have it. When we come there to that great wedding supper, look across that table to one another. Oh God, just a simple handshake. Tears of joy rolls down our cheeks. Oh my, what a day. The king come in his beauty. The king, &gt;&gt; the king comes in his beauty &gt;&gt; and wipe all the tears. Can you imagine the King of Kings coming out to that great feast and with his with his finger wipe away your tears &gt;&gt; that you would never shed another tear because all sorrow is gone and have the king to say to you, &gt;&gt; "Don't cry. Don't cry. &gt;&gt; It's all over now. &gt;&gt; Your crying is done. Your sighing is done. Your mourning is over. The battle is won. The pain is gone. Old age is finished. All the turmoil, the turmoil and the trouble of the pest house of the flesh and the reigning of Satan's Eden. It's all finished now. You've made it all the way to the marriage &gt;&gt; and have the king I feel like doing something. I don't know what yet. &gt;&gt; Have the king pour you a cup. Yes, he &gt;&gt; the King of Kings &gt;&gt; pour you a cup &gt;&gt; and say, "Don't you remember? Don't you remember that I promised you that I would not drink of the cup &gt;&gt; of the fruit of the vine again? Didn't you read it in the word that I would not drink of the cup of the fruit of the vine again until I drink it with you a new in the kingdom of my father? &gt;&gt; And you your little trembling, your little tremble, your your jaw tremble, your your little butt tremble. And he said, "The day has come." and he pours you a cup and he takes a sip and he passes that cup to you and he gives you an opportunity to drink again the fruit of the vine and he says to you, "It's all over now. No more crying over your lost children. &gt;&gt; No more wrestling around in the altar for the victory to come." Somebody ought to help me. &gt;&gt; No more stripes on your back. No more scars to be made. &gt;&gt; No more car accidents. No more motorcycle accidents. No more overdue bills. No more bankruptcy. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; No more confusion. No more hateful boss man. &gt;&gt; No more getting stepped on as your friend climbs the corporate ladder a few rungs ahead of you and uses you. Amen. &gt;&gt; To get a step up gone, &gt;&gt; no more hurt. &gt;&gt; No more wound, &gt;&gt; no more disappointment, &gt;&gt; no more sorrow. &gt;&gt; And I saved it. I saved it. I left the earth realm. And I did not drink again from the cup of the fruit of the vine. I did not take another sip. not another drop until this day. And now I stand with you in the kingdom of my father. And I I want to share with you a cup of the of the fruit of the vine of the wine. And I want you listen. He said, "Oh, the tears don't cry. It's all over now. There'll never be no more healing campaign." Woo! Amen. &gt;&gt; Why will there not be any more prayer lines or healing campaign? Somebody tell me. &gt;&gt; There's no sickness. &gt;&gt; There's no disease. &gt;&gt; There's no mental oppression, no depression, no schizophrenia. [Applause] &gt;&gt; No split personality, &gt;&gt; no anxiety attacks, &gt;&gt; no panic. There'll be no need for a campaign of healing or a prayer line or to be anointed with oil. &gt;&gt; No more tired, restless nights. &gt;&gt; No more wheelchairs. No more walking sticks. No more knee braces. &gt;&gt; No more tendonitis. No more gout. &gt;&gt; No more achy joints. No more sciatica. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. That's enough to tear the walls down. &gt;&gt; No more sciatica. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No more no more floaters in your eyesight. &gt;&gt; No more having to ask somebody to repeat what they said &gt;&gt; because you couldn't hear. &gt;&gt; No more tongue tied. Amen. &gt;&gt; No more dumb in scriptural sense, unable to speak and to articulate. No more autism. No more ADHD. [Applause] &gt;&gt; No more backsliding. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the king's got the cup in his hand. &gt;&gt; He said, "You made it all the way. &gt;&gt; I sat with you at a table. many years ago in the city of the most high yushim and I drank the wine and I ate the Passover uh bread, the unleavened bread and I washed your feet and I told you I wouldn't drink the cup again until I drank. Here we are. &gt;&gt; The day has arrived. The long hard battle is finished. &gt;&gt; No more confusion in your home. No more rebellious teenager. &gt;&gt; No more suicide. No more cancer. &gt;&gt; No more death in any form. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Somebody said no. No more three-hour sermons from Brother Jelly. That's right. That's right. But we'll sit at the feet of the lamb. &gt;&gt; And never want to move. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Never have to go to the bathroom. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know. That's that's too plain to say. Some of you spend so much time in there, you ought to just take your bed with you. But no more. &gt;&gt; No more stomach troubles. &gt;&gt; No more not holding your water. &gt;&gt; I I I don't Look, I don't have anybody to impress. And I'd rather be raw and real anyway &gt;&gt; because that's what I can relate to. No more ingrown toenail. &gt;&gt; No more Come on. That's right. &gt;&gt; No more trigger finger. &gt;&gt; No more big old swelled. Sister Betty Pilington. Her hands swelled so bad. Her knuckles and joints so deformed from arthritis until she couldn't even open her hand. It just got worse and worse and worse and worse. No more arthritis. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No more COVID. No more pneumonia. No more flu. No more deformed babies. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; When you take this cup, you represent all of what I just said. &gt;&gt; It's like a toast. &gt;&gt; Lord, you said you wouldn't drink it anymore. You've told me that as often as I would eat the bread and drink the cup, I would show your death &gt;&gt; until you come. So every time I celebrate the fact that you died for me, &gt;&gt; it's like a toast. &gt;&gt; I'm taking it from the pastor's hand. But one of these days, blessed be the holy name of our God. One of these days I'll take the cup from your own hand &gt;&gt; and I'll drink that cup with you again &gt;&gt; in the new kingdom. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So this communion, brother Brandham said it ought to be called the Lord's supper. And then he goes on to tell us what communion is and why we ought to have communion. And so we understand what he's saying. Just taking little elements is not communing. Communion is, he said, talking and hearing an answer. &gt;&gt; You're talking with one another. You're communing with one another. Now, we do that with the saints in the natural. In the spiritual, we do it with the master. Yes. &gt;&gt; And that communion that we do with him, you talking to him and then shutting up &gt;&gt; and letting him talk to you, that is communion. And this cup represents a small portion. &gt;&gt; He said it wasn't breakfast. Are you here? &gt;&gt; It's just It's just 12:47. &gt;&gt; You should have gone to bed earlier. &gt;&gt; Just think about it. Just think about what we have, what it means, &gt;&gt; what it says to us. He said, "It's not breakfast, it's not lunch, it's not a snack, it's supper." Almost every time he said it, he goes on to give us a discourse about uh those who confuse dinner and supper. Remember, depending on what part of the country you're in and what what mindset you follow, some people call lunch dinner and dinner lunch, and you know how it goes. Supper's, he said, but it wasn't breakfast. It wasn't lunch. It was supper. It should be taken in the evening time. He said, "It's Passover." He said it. &gt;&gt; He said it. You despisers of the feast of the Lord. &gt;&gt; He said it. Come on. &gt;&gt; He said that it was an annual event. He said that it was the pascal lamb. &gt;&gt; He said it was the Passover. &gt;&gt; He told us what it represented. And he said as the lamb was killed, all the lambs were killed in the ninth hour, &gt;&gt; 3:00 in the afternoon. &gt;&gt; So was our Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when we commemorate that with the communion cup, we ought to do it in the evening. &gt;&gt; Even as the sun is going down, he said &gt;&gt; to remember that it was in the afternoon, in the late of the day that our Lord died. It was in the late of the day that all the lambs, millions of lambs, millions of of bullocks, millions of pigeons and turtle doves were were were shedding their blood for for a moment of some kind of peace and hope that you could go on a little while longer until one day the lamb, the lamb, the lamb came. the spotless lamb, the perfect lamb, the bleeding lamb. He came and he finished it for all of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, and he said, "So when we come together in the evening and we take communion so we don't serve it in the morning, we serve it in the evening and we do that simply to remember &gt;&gt; that our Lord took his last breath &gt;&gt; just prior to the sun going down." We're talking about Middle East now, not Alberta, not Iceland, not places where we we have some variation in sunset here, but not like they do in some other places. Extreme variations. It's in that that last quadrant of the day, our Lord. And when we have communion, when we have the Lord's supper, we're remembering that. &gt;&gt; Isn't that good? &gt;&gt; He said, "No more wheelchairs, no more graves. My God, no more mausoleum." Do you know it's very expensive to die? You got to pay them to lift the lid. Pay them to shut the lid. You got to pay them to carry the lid. You got to pay them to let your pawbearers carry the box. Everything. Everything. They know they'll never get this whole world never get no more money out of your loved one. So, they're going to stick it to you. &gt;&gt; But one of these days, and I thank God for the great undertakers, and I thank God for the great funeral home directors, especially those that let us uh worship like we want to worship and brag about it when we get through. I like them. I love them. I'm thankful for them. Not too long ago, two of them ride up out here in their big motorcycles. They looked to me like they it was too old to be riding motorcycles in the first place, but right out there in the parking lot, we just want to come out. Just want, you know, just see the place. And I But no more. No more need for Strifler Hamby. &gt;&gt; No more need for Vance. &gt;&gt; No graves. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No deciding what mama's going to be buried in. &gt;&gt; No more Amen. &gt;&gt; It's done. No more sickness. No more dementia. No more Alzheimer's. No more forgetting your name. &gt;&gt; No more having your loved one look right through you because they know they ought to, but they can't quite decide who you are. Finished. &gt;&gt; That right there'd be enough to make you want to go. Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, for that great day." And then you'll say, "Enter into the joys of the Lord." Oh, I long to hear at that day, Father. Don't you want to hear him say that? &gt;&gt; Let's keep reading. And now, while we're here together, and all of us longing the same thing. Make us true what? &gt;&gt; Steward. &gt;&gt; Steward. You and I have a responsibility what we do and how we handle what's been given to us. &gt;&gt; That's why we don't lay at home on Tuesday night. That's why we don't drag in here late when we could have been on time. &gt;&gt; Because we're made to be good stewards of what God's done in our life. &gt;&gt; That's why we clean up. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be, you know, you don't have to be dressed like a movie star. Brother said, "Wear the best you got." &gt;&gt; And we ought to do it. And and uh I should have let Austin uh Yantis preach that today because I got out of my car and I wondered who in the world is that standing at the door and look who it was. Look, look how they clean up. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; It's wonderful. Wonderful when somebody takes a little extra. I thought Brother Austin Hodes, let's get on the Austin's. I thought Brother Austin Hodes look very sharp this morning standing up there all skinny on the platform and swap it around them parts. &gt;&gt; It's nice when we can do that. There's a time when we we feel that we want to. &gt;&gt; And I love it when people do it because they want to. We're here together and all of us longing for the same thing. Make us true stewards. May we shape our lives. Listen. &gt;&gt; I want to look around. I want you to see me. I want to see you. &gt;&gt; I want eye contact. &gt;&gt; May we shape our lives &gt;&gt; by temperance. &gt;&gt; By self control. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, don't you think brother Brandham knew the devil had some power? &gt;&gt; Don't you think the devil Don't you think brother Brandham knew the devil was dark &gt;&gt; and he would tempt and he would influence? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Then why in the world did he tell us that we can shape our lives by our self-control &gt;&gt; because greater is he that is in us? &gt;&gt; The spirit of stupid needs to be cast out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's just plain stupid to keep doing the same thing. &gt;&gt; Over and over and over again, hoping &gt;&gt; that one day you're going to get better results. &gt;&gt; Stupid. &gt;&gt; Somebody said stupid is a very ugly word. Well, we're not going to be polyiana today. We're going to be rich and raw. Just right nittygritty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; If you don't like the word stupid, how about dumb? It's just dumb of us to think that we can keep doing the same thing over and over and over again, &gt;&gt; expecting to get different results than what we got the last time and the last time and the last time and the last time. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "You've gone as far with God as you're ever going to go &gt;&gt; until you're willing to pay a greater price." &gt;&gt; People tell me, "I'm working on my relationship with Jesus Christ." And you see them doing anything and everything but drawing near to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you working on again? &gt;&gt; What are you working on again? It it it's so nittygritty now. It it it's so rubber meet the road now. &gt;&gt; It's so pedal to the metal now &gt;&gt; that I just don't have one more sugar tit left. That's how I always knew when my preacher was serious &gt;&gt; cuz he pulled out the sugar tit word. &gt;&gt; And to my little child like mine, that was like flat out sailor cussing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I knew he meant business. And when he would turn around and say, "I wouldn't give a tinker's damn for that." I thought, "Oh my goodness, we're going to have to have an altar call." I'll never forget Brother Cecil Hburger. Did any of you know Brother Cecil? Did you ever meet him, Shashana? Maybe your family might have might have met him. Dear, dear brother Cecil Hburger, been gone to be with the Lord a long time. He was a master watch maker and repairman. He took care of his wife, sister Helen, over 20 years of her sickness, unable to brush her own hair. I went and visited Brother Herger. He visited us here. I went and visited Brother Herger in his home and and uh saw his little apartment with with sister Helen. Saw how he had to pick her up and put her in the chair, how he had to take care of her, how spotless the apartment was. what uh he wrote a beautiful little book of poetry that I have in my office and he's the one who taught me what a tinker's dam was. He said it'll take a watch maker or a pot repairman to be able to tell you what it is. It's those little slivers, those little pieces of metal. They used to pedal them door to door. In the old days, they would take one of those little pieces of metal and they would repair your pots and pans. The guy who delivered them around with all the other wares was called a tinker. And the little piece of metal that blocked the hole was called a dam. And it was very, very cheap to buy a tinker's dam. I learned earlier than that what a sugar tit was. It was a piece of muslin, a piece of linen, a piece of something like a handkerchief and a a little piece of uh uh candy could be melted. a little peppermint or something sweet melted sometime in a handkerchief. So that when you gave your little baby paragarch which tasted like poison but knocked them out when they were so sick. They could take that little sugar and suck on it and soothe theirelves because in those days they didn't have 11 dozen kinds of paces. I called mine a bigger. A big guy. Kids call them all kinds of things. short ones, long ones, skinny ones, fat ones, rubber ones, plastic ones. Uh I guess this uh this uh you know uh environmental crowd, they'll have a wooden one before it's over if they don't already. And all mammy had all them old mammy was a sugar tit. &gt;&gt; Anything pillowcase would work &gt;&gt; to sue that baby. Well, I want you to know I'm out of them. &gt;&gt; There's no time left now. If Jesus terried another five years, there's no time left now. I want to say if he terried another decade and I'm not expecting him to do that but I would still say today there's not one minute, one hour, one second to waste chasing your own tail like a cat or a dog in the field or a gerbble going round and round and round. It's time to break out Johnny Crow. It's time to break out, Johnny Crow. &gt;&gt; Quit going around in your circle. &gt;&gt; Get off of that 12T shuffle &gt;&gt; and sell out. &gt;&gt; Sell out today. and tell the Lord when you come through that line, I'm going to take these elements tonight as I have many times before in my Christian existence. But may tonight, may they mark in my life a place where I turn the corner. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And I began to live &gt;&gt; in the privilege &gt;&gt; of a son of God. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Meaning that I have the Father's authority given to me through Jesus, Lord, &gt;&gt; to rebuke temptation. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you can stay off of pornography. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, until you can, this is what we ought to do. We ought to just preach it real hard. Until you can, you don't need a wife. You don't deserve a wife. You ought not to get you a wife. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because you'll destroy what you have. &gt;&gt; You'll never convince me that God doesn't give victory. &gt;&gt; You'll never convince me that this word is not enough &gt;&gt; if we'll come open before him &gt;&gt; and keep applying that word in faith over and over again and confessing what the word said. You'll never make me believe that there's not total deliverance available. I know it for myself and I know it for you. &gt;&gt; And this mambby pamissified message preaching that goes on to make you think that you can continue on doing those things and living those things and just come up to the altar, &gt;&gt; put your hand up, worship a little bit, go out and live like &gt;&gt; we knew better than that in Pentecost. We knew better than that in holiness. We knew better than that before the message came. &gt;&gt; You fed that spirit and fed that spirit and fed that spirit. It's not just men and you fed that spirit and fed that spirit until that spirit is bigger in you &gt;&gt; than your regenerated spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The one that died so that the life of Christ could resurrect and live in you. Some will call it a soul. The Bible calls it a spirit. &gt;&gt; You can call it whatever you want to call it, but you better win the victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; It It matters. &gt;&gt; It does. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There's only one person that's going to climb the holy hill of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. the hill of Zion, the redeemed of the Lord, the overcoming bride. And that's those that have clean hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you don't have clean hands if you're still chasing that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you don't have a pure heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because you're not. Listen, lust is human desire. And you must, it's healthy. You must desire your wife. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the one you're married to, not the one you're shacking up with. &gt;&gt; The one you're married to, the one that wears your name. &gt;&gt; You'll never get your total freedom from anything until you understand there's a right way of doing it and a wrong way of doing it. &gt;&gt; You say, "I can't give it up. I can't give this up. I can't give that up." I had a I had a great uncle who couldn't give it up. He had him a honey. His wife was a holiness preacher and my great uncle had him a honey. And you know what? My my great aunt knew it. And so when he would come home on Friday, this disgusted me. I can't even hardly call this holy, but she did it as holy unto the Lord. She said, "I can't change him, but I'm going to keep my vow. I'm going to keep my vow. I'm going to do what God told me to do. And he'd come home from work on Friday. She would have washed his clothes and packed his bag. And he'd take that bag, bid her goodbye, and go live the weekend with his honey. She'd come home. He'd come home on Sunday night and throw that suitcase on the table. She'd get it, unpack it, and get ready. After she'd been in church all day, she'd get ready to wash it. He decided one day that he that he couldn't live without her and he drank some kind of a a drain cleaner and he was going to die. He said, "I if I can't have her, I want to die." Well, I don't believe in women preachers, but I'm glad I had one in my life until the Lord showed her the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Cuz she didn't play with spirits like that. My granny went to the hospital. I happen to know went to the hospital and she looked at him and everybody was going in rubbing his hair, you know, his inside, his esophagus. Can you imagine? You put that stuff down your drain to eat up the hair and grease and stuff in your pipes. What do you think it does for your pipes? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He lay there in convulsive pain. They didn't know if he's going to live or not. And everybody's combing his hair, his wife in one corner, his honey in another, and my granny walked in and she walked over and she put her hand on his arm and she said, "Herman, come on. Is she worth it now? &gt;&gt; I'm just backing up. What is wrong with you? What made you do such a stupid thing? &gt;&gt; The family didn't know whether to attack her and run her out of the room or not. They just kind of bowed their head. She said, "I want you to know something. You know better than that kind of life, and you know better than to try to take your life." She said, "I remember the night &gt;&gt; that you touched the Lord at the altar many, many years ago. You may have forgot, but God hadn't forgot." &gt;&gt; And through his graveled voice, he said, "If she if I can't have her, I don't want to live." And I heard people in the room going, Oh, my granny said that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life. One breath of hell will make you change your mind. &gt;&gt; Oh, they ought to ask her to preach his funeral. &gt;&gt; She said, "One breath of hell will make you a gener." Well, if I I I don't even want to go I don't even want to go to heaven if she can't go with me. if I can't spend eternity with her, I I I don't even want to go to heaven." She said, "Look, I don't have time. I don't have time to play these little silly games with you. You better call on the Lord. You may have less than 24 hours to live. You better call on the Lord. And you better send that hussy out of this room. &gt;&gt; Back where she belongs. And you better grab a hold of that saint of God that you stood at an altar and made a vow with &gt;&gt; or in hell like the rich man, you're going to lift up your eyes and cry out in torment. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "What do you do? Throw y'all out of the room." No. Cried, called on the Lord, &gt;&gt; turned his life around. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God raised him up. And he outlived his honey wherever she was. He outlived his wife. &gt;&gt; He outlived my grandmother and my grandfather. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I just recently reconnected with a cousin who told me that in the last days of his life, he was still sharing that testimony. I don't have to spend an eternity in hell because somebody told me [Applause] &gt;&gt; that my little fun &gt;&gt; was not worth my soul. &gt;&gt; We don't hear this kind of preaching in the message because we all have this great concept of predestination and election and destiny and purpose and and God knew before we knew and and I believe every bit of that with all my heart. But I want you to know, you can fool yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good. &gt;&gt; And lose all reward. &gt;&gt; All victory. And here's the worst part. You can drag somebody beside you, your lovely wife, your your your husband, your children, your impressionable little ones around you. You can drag them out of the victory with you. I wouldn't do that if I were you. I would make up my mind that the price that Jesus paid is sufficient. &gt;&gt; It is sufficient. And all I have to do is make the right choice and keep making the right choice and flee. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; get it out. I don't believe in uh a lot of these things that go on the Pentecostal and charismatic world, but I've told you many times that that youth pastor down in Brownsville. And the only reason why I would have known anything about what was going on is because of the Kilpatrick family that my grandmother prayed for Sister Kilpatrick across the river in Columbus. And God healed her and uh uh gave her her life and her son, we called him out, they call him John now, pastored that church in Pensacola. And the youth pastor there had to sit his little family down one day in the midst of what they called revival and say, "I cannot have the internet in the home anymore." Now, they don't do like this in the assembly of God. This is radical. &gt;&gt; He said, "I can't have the internet anymore. I'm so sorry that you children are going to have to find other means to do your schoolwork, your your work, the things that you do, and the games you play, and the fun you have. And it is not because I can't trust you. It is because daddy can't trust himself. &gt;&gt; I've got to come clean before my family. And I and he went to church and he came clean before the whole crowd from all over the world. Come there for revival. He said, "I was not able for I was not able to control. I was not able I was not able. So, I have to be the only person in the whole church that doesn't have the internet on my phone and doesn't have the internet piped in my home because I just do not seem to have enough self-control. &gt;&gt; No wonder Brother Brandon said, "May we shape our lives by self-control." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we'll know by the help of the Holy Spirit. Put that back. Thank you. put by by the help of the Holy Spirit to have full confidence that Jesus will say, "I've got to have full confidence. I've got to have full confidence. I don't want to wait and get it next week. I want to get it before the the the the bread on my lip tonight. I want it. I want full confidence that I'm going to hear well done, my good and faithful servant on that day. I want it now. I want it before I taste the wine." Amen. Amen. 112. Good. Got 45 more minutes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, my brother. Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Genesis 12:1-3. Let's go there quickly. Now, the Lord had said unto Abram, "Get thee out of thy You." You You act like you're mad, Brother Shel. I'm not at all mad. I told you I've been under a burden from the Lord for months now. I told you I can't sleep. I told you that that I I can't enjoy life. I can't have fellowship. I get so nervous. I can't I can't hardly come out after a service and I can't help it. I didn't ask for it. I didn't choose it. Don't even particularly like it. People will say, "What's it like?" I don't know how to describe it. Can you teach us about Don't know. Don't know how to tell you. Don't don't know how to tell you. I just know. And if any of you have ever had anything like it or similar to it, it just consumes you. Jesus is he's platting the the whip to drive the money changers out of the his father's house. He the zeal of the Lord's house. He he fulfilled the prophecy of the Old Testament prophet. The zeal of the Lord's house has confused has consumed excuse me. The zeal of the Lord's house has consumed me. The things that matter matter. The things that don't matter matter. &gt;&gt; Don't. The things that matter matter. The things that don't matter don't matter. &gt;&gt; And we've got to find out what matters. &gt;&gt; And what don't matter. Integrity matters. Honesty matters. The fruit of the spirit matter. The character of Jesus Christ matters. The attributes of the Holy Ghost matter. &gt;&gt; It matters. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; how much your tide check is, that doesn't matter. Just give him what belongs to him. &gt;&gt; If it's two might, your two might is just as important, special, treasured, &gt;&gt; obedient &gt;&gt; as someone who writes a $1,000 check. Amen. &gt;&gt; If anyone here can prove or has even a legitimate complaint against me in 35 years of pastoring this church that I have treated people differently because of what they could do for me or because of what they gave to the church. I'd like to see the evidence. And let me tell you why. Because of that old granny. That's why. That's why. Don't because of her teaching me. You're not looking to people &gt;&gt; for your source. &gt;&gt; You're looking to the God. The one who hired you. &gt;&gt; The one who hired you is the only one that can fire you. &gt;&gt; And if you start looking to people for your source and supply, you'll miss it every time. You'll miss him. &gt;&gt; You'll get out of fellowship with him. You look to him and don't matter. Don't matter. It does not matter who God uses to meet your need. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's him. &gt;&gt; I've tried to live by that motto. So, it's not what you can do for us, what you can do for the church, or what how much is on your tithe check. Those things do not matter. Be faithful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Matters. &gt;&gt; I know this is rough. I I know. I know. &gt;&gt; But there's barrels of blessings. &gt;&gt; If you want to line up to get them, I want to line up to get them. Now the Lord said unto Abram, "Get thee out of thy country, from thy kindred, from thy father's house, unto a land, and I will show thee, and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee. Make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing, and I will bless them that bless thee. Curse him that cursseeth thee, and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed." I don't even have time to talk about the thousands of ways that God has fulfilled that promise to Abraham. through the seed of Abraham, through the in through the ingenuity and the brilliance of the Jewish people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who are light years above in medical procedures, in disease treatment. I I could go, you know, you know, you know, you know, because I had a friend who was there at the Wiseman Institute and you know that they were they were literally bringing healing to people with Lou Garerig's disease. The technology is cheap and available. It would be much cheaper to do it here, to make it here, to produce it here than it is there. Cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for the full band of treatment if you go to Israel. But we could do the same thing here. But do you think in your lifetime if Jesus Terry, do you think in your lifetime it would ever go through all of its processes of approval? You think the drug companies would back off and let somebody build a little little contraption or something that you can build from the hardware store and and reverse lug? No, no, no, no, no. That's the world we live in. I was in I was sitting in Washington DC in the room where a man who had had not walked who had not been able to move totally paralyzed quadriplegic and and in Israel they created by by their by their brilliance and ingenuity a a suit. And I watched this man as they strapped that suit on him and he took his few first steps across that stage with a suit with a with a contraption that is able to cause a man with no nerve communication to be able to walk. God said every nation of the earth will be blessed &gt;&gt; because of your seed Abraham. Now does anybody believe God's kept his word? &gt;&gt; He has. In the message Melzdc the the great prince and king paragraph 131 and Abraham left the land sojourn called himself a stranger and a pilgrim. And look Abraham as all mortals not an immortal man not a man that can't make a mistake but constantly made mistakes. &gt;&gt; Hear this. &gt;&gt; Do you have hope? &gt;&gt; Are you like me? You always making mistakes. There's hope for you and Abraham. There's hope for me and Abraham. But no matter how many mistakes he made, his anchor still what? &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Anybody in here got a promise? &gt;&gt; I don't see you. I don't hear you. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Anybody in here got a promise? &gt;&gt; Anybody got an anchor holding? &gt;&gt; You'll make mistakes. You you and I just got to smarten up and quit making the same ones over and over and over and over and over again because we're making excuses for them instead of getting deliverance for them. &gt;&gt; But we're going to make mistakes. So don't you think that anybody in this house is perfect? We all have to run back to him. But boy, once you find out how easy it is &gt;&gt; to run back to him, you will. You will. You'll run back and forth. He But no matter how many his anchor held for he had a promise. Verse four and five of 12 tells us that Abram departed. The Lord had spoken unto him. Lot went with him. Abram was how old? 75 years old. When he departed out of Heron, 75 years old, he took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son. That would be his nephew. Correct. Uh and all their substance that he had gathered, and the souls that had gotten in Haron, and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan, and into the land of Canaan did what? They came in in the in the message. uh MelzDC again paragraph 133. I'm I'm hurrying but I will slow down in a moment when it matters. So he took with him Sarah. He took Lot. He took his daddy. And as long as there was with him, God could not bless him. As long as they was with him, God could not bless him. There had to be a separation. That old man finally died. They buried him. He went up on a little farther and Lot backslid. &gt;&gt; And you know what happened there? And then he separated himself from him. his nephew lost his dad. Old-timers dying out and now Lot backslid. And he had to separate himself. I preached a series seven separations of Abraham. And now he has to pull away from from the from the real relative other than his wife. It's his nephew. And then God appeared to him again. When when did God appear to him again? When he separated himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; From those who would frustrate the purposes of God in his life. &gt;&gt; You don't have time to play with a sand valley. You don't have time to play with a Tobaya. The work is great. The work is large. And we are separated on the wall. In whatsoever place thou hearest the sound of the trumpet, resort ye there, for our God shall fight for us. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What are you saying? I'm saying you're building a wall. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And your buddies &gt;&gt; a little fox. &gt;&gt; Brush up against the wall. The whole thing would fall in. Now, &gt;&gt; how do you know so much about sand ballads and Tobias? Cuz I've gone to church with them my entire 50 years of serving the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There's always going to be a sand ballad. There's always going to be a Tobaya. There's always going to be somebody. There'll always be somebody raise up among you and say, "You'll never fill up this church again. &gt;&gt; You'll never build a building. You'll never do this. You'll never do that." &gt;&gt; But sometimes Abraham has to separate himself from Lot. &gt;&gt; Sometimes children of the promise. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Sometimes children of the promise. If I get it all out tonight, you won't have to hear from me this week. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. Sometimes you got to you got to separate yourself from the frustrators of purpose. Those who don't understand your vision, they don't understand your calling. They don't understand what God's trying to do in your life. You how could they? You don't even fully understand it. &gt;&gt; You just know you got to obey. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You just know you have to keep being obedient. Yes. &gt;&gt; I know that people like to think that brother Brandham live le led this strange life simply because of his calling. And I want you to know that's absolutely true. But there are people in this room they don't have that calling. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that I understand that he didn't need anyone to take his place. &gt;&gt; And nobody has that same calling that he had. But they've kind of taken that and slung it around a little bit and made people think that what you're doing, what God called you to do, has no value. I want you to know the purpose of your life is extremely valuable in the in the currency of the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; You you may feel like a pew warmer, but that but but be a faithful one until God opens up something else for you. &gt;&gt; But but it's all right for you to embrace the call that you've got. It's all right for you to understand there's a heavy price to pay to be used of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all right for you to understand that sometime you got to pack up your stuff. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And get out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is not where you belong. &gt;&gt; Haron is not where you were born to be. &gt;&gt; Sometime you got to get out. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Abraham realized, Abram realized, I got to get out. He thought he could take Lot all the way. Listen, you may love somebody. &gt;&gt; You may cherish somebody. They may be valuable to you. It may be your greatest desire to take them all the way. You may hook your arm in their arm and try to drag them all the way up to the top of Mount Zion. But I want you to know there may come a day that you realize that you'll never get up there by yourself. &gt;&gt; You'll never get up there dragging somebody else. &gt;&gt; You'll only get up there by depending heavily on the Lord. &gt;&gt; And letting everybody else do the climb. &gt;&gt; There are no shortcuts. &gt;&gt; There are there are no discharges &gt;&gt; in this army of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to fight till the end. &gt;&gt; Anybody willing to fight? &gt;&gt; Why? You won't even be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And you're going to fight. &gt;&gt; No, you're not. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You won't even marry him in Christian baptism. &gt;&gt; So afraid of what mama might say or daddy might say or or neighbor might say or church member over across the road might say. You better run to the water. &gt;&gt; You better wear that name of Jesus Christ and wear it like a badge of honor. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I'm willing to fight." You won't even wash your face. &gt;&gt; You started with a little cover stick. You started with a spray on. And now you hang out on that aisle. No, you won't fight. You haven't even begun to fight. You make up your mind today. I'm going to fight. &gt;&gt; I'm going all the way with this word. &gt;&gt; If I'm the only one in my church, here here is the difference between the bride and somebody in the church. Somebody in the church says, "Well, my she does it." &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; That's a church member. &gt;&gt; They're a dime a dozen. &gt;&gt; Oh, he does it. &gt;&gt; His children do it. &gt;&gt; We sound like denominational people, don't we? &gt;&gt; The bride don't even talk like that. She don't reason like that. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. She's hanging out with the word. If I'm the only one, &gt;&gt; if I'm the only one, &gt;&gt; if my husband is the only one, if my children are the only ones, we don't come to church to do like everybody else. We come to fight &gt;&gt; because at the end of this war, I'm going to have a cup. Amen. given to me by the king. He went on a little further. Lot backs slid. You know what happened? Separated himself from him. Then God appeared to him again. And now Abraham took all over the ground. It's all yours. When he made the right choice, that's all. Separate yourself from everything. And so Genesis 13:11 through13, Lot chose the plain of the Jordan. You know that. Journeyed east. Just flash it up there. Separated himself. But verse 13, Abraham, look at verse 12. Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan. Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain. And here's what he did. He didn't move to Sodom all all at once. &gt;&gt; He just pitched his tent, &gt;&gt; inch by inch. &gt;&gt; When you turn when you turn your head, your focus, your attention toward the fantasy &gt;&gt; that they pedal down there in Sodom, You've already made a decision. &gt;&gt; You're thinking, "I'm going to make a decision one of these." You've already made a decision when you started inching your way. &gt;&gt; Is that what is that the word? Am I ugly? Am I mean, are you getting quiet because I'm too mean? &gt;&gt; Just Just you know, here's what people do. They just back up against each other. &gt;&gt; They do. &gt;&gt; See how close they can get to the edge &gt;&gt; and still get by. Come on. &gt;&gt; Just see how tight they can wear it &gt;&gt; and still move. &gt;&gt; I know why you won't pin it. If you pinned it, you couldn't walk. Cuz it ain't big enough in the first place. &gt;&gt; You ain't a mannequin. You're a person. &gt;&gt; You've got bends and curves. And &gt;&gt; Yep. Now, &gt;&gt; I'm an expert on curves. I know what I'm talking about. I know what's I know what stands between me and my knees. And I know how to get a bigger size. &gt;&gt; Just inching just inch in your way. Just inch in your way. You outgrow it before you know it. That's one thing. Four or five years later, you're still squeezing in what won't fit, won't do, not even considering the fact you're all hanging out. You're just putting your hip out there towards Sodom. &gt;&gt; I remember. I remember when they preached it like this. I remember when the message preachers preached it like this. I remember when they preached holiness. I remember when they preached against the holidays. I remember when they preached against the television. I remember &gt;&gt; now &gt;&gt; against the playing cards, against the dice in the home. &gt;&gt; All substantiated by quotes. &gt;&gt; And now we're all there. We're all there. Listen to them now. We're all there. We know all there is to know about the seven seal. We know all there is to know about the tent. We know all there is to know about the seven thunders. And we're in the midst of the greatest revival there's ever been in the world. Then why have you got one foot in Sodom? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a pinky toe in the word. &gt;&gt; Make a clip out of that one and then let me give you my email list and show you where it needs to go. Send that one around. People used to dip their toe in the world. Now they put theirelves in the world and hang a little bit over in the church. Don't don't preach anything that'll make us feel uh convicted in any shape, form or fashion. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Maybe that's the reason. Paragraph 135, same sermon. Maybe that's the reason some of Oh. Oh. Abraham dwelt in the land of Canaan Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain pitches tent. But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly. That sounds like an amazing place to pack up and move your family, &gt;&gt; doesn't it? Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe the Lord's calling you to Las Vegas. &gt;&gt; I have a hard time driving through Phoenix City. &gt;&gt; I'm certainly I can't hardly make it in Walmart. I'm certainly not going to move to Sin City. &gt;&gt; Maybe that's the reason some of us are not getting along so well. We're holding on to things that we ought to let go of &gt;&gt; in the separation. A little doubt, a little wonder, a little skeptic. Wonder if it's right. Could this be? Could that be? How could it be? Doesn't that sound like us sometime? Cut. Look, this is a servant of the Lord. Cut loose this morning. &gt;&gt; 133. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 133 on the clock. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 12:1. Let us lay aside every weight and every sin that does so easily beset us a sin. What is that? I'm quoting the unbelief that does so easily beset us. and let us run with patience. A race is set before us, looking under Christ, the author and finisher of our faith. Now notice Abraham here. Then he got in trouble. Lot went down to Sodom and Gomorrah. &gt;&gt; And you know the rest of the story. I got to hurry. In Genesis 14:es 1-4, it talks about the first international war in the land of the Bible. There were there were uh some cities on the Dead Sea, five of them by by by number who had been paying tribute to the armies of the North for 12 years. In the 13 for protection in the 13th year, they said, "Look, we're tired of shipping all of our money to the north. We're just not going to do it anymore." So, there was a four king coalition from the east who decided that I would go through all their names if we had the time. why they even put them in here. I knew I wouldn't get to it. But anyway, those four kings said, "We're going to go down and we're going to shake a knot in them and they're going to pay their tribute like they've done for the past 12 years." You understand so far? So these eastern kings, they're not on a raid. They're not just going trying to take something from somebody. They're going there to reimpart imperial control over the trade corridors, major trade corridors of the land of what we now call Israel and all of the most valuable resources around the Dead Sea region. They're going to go back and take control. So this coalition makes a sweeping raid down that TransJordan Valley all the way through Sier and El Pon and then back up to Kadesh and to Hazison Teamar. The five Canaanite kings meet them in the valley of Sadim. The valley of Sadeem is at the is at the Dead Sea. The Valley of Sadim is known for its slime pits. Anybody know what that is? &gt;&gt; Dangerous. &gt;&gt; It's like quicksand. &gt;&gt; It's what they make brick. It's what they build cities out of. It has multiple uses. It's like tar. It is exactly like aphalt. We call it asphalt. My wife Canadian eastern, she calls it ash fault. Whatever you call it, it's black. Especially when it's been painted black like ours. And it is, that's what this is. It's it's a natural form. Comes right out of the ground. It'll seal anything. It's a valuable asset. And they're they're fighting. Those Canaanite kings said, "Hey, we can't we can't just let them come in there, take this. We got to make a little bit for ourselves." And and so forth. And so the next thing you know, they come all the way down there and they take captives and they start taking prisoners and they start taking spoils with them. And guess what part of the spoils they take? They take Lot. Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, they wouldn't have took Lot if he hadn't been there. &gt;&gt; Oh, he didn't mean to get shot. He was just in the bar. He He was just in the bar. He He didn't mean to to break his leg on the dance floor. Well, he was just in there. He He was just just relaxing, just chilling. Why? He He He He didn't mean to get shot. He He was just picking up a little drug. Just just just just little little dime bag, just handful of pills. Don't know what to call them because they didn't have no prescription. Just they might they might make you feel better. They might kill you. But he did, you know, he was just looking to relax. Folks, he ought not been down. He ought not to have been down there uh in in in the in the ghetto looking for something to to to lift him. He ought not been at the bar looking to play a game of pool to relax. There's just some places Sodom, if Lot would have not been in Sodom, it says the men of Sodom were more wicked than the rest of the plates. If he hadn't have been down there, pitched his tent till he finally moved in. Come on. &gt;&gt; We know something was wrong with the man &gt;&gt; because when the angels did finally come to get him out &gt;&gt; the men, the homosexuals of the city come and try to rape and molest the angels. And what does brilliant Lot do? &gt;&gt; Be careful how you criticize him &gt;&gt; because you sit down in front of filth with your daughters. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Aren't you Aren't you Aren't you on dangerous territory? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He says to the to the men of the city, "Just hold right on. I I know you'd rather have the male angels, but would you take my daughters? Just do with them as you." Something's wrong with this man. This man had no business. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And so they take him away. He's kidnapped, stolen away, and one of the kings of Sodom started to run. Brother Brandham tells us in paragraph 140, just flash it up there. I can't read it, but but he starts to run and he and he fell in the slime. That's that's 142. I want 140. Uh he fell in the slime flats and died. And he said slime is what they make their bricks and mortar. In Genesis 14 through17, hurry. Uh he said, "And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, it wasn't his brother. It was his nephew. But brother was a term of endearment." And listen what brother Bram said in paragraph 142, "Brother, brother." I like that. His brother. And look what the Lord had done to him. But yet there was some kind of tithe that binds. Listen. If the brother has backslid, like the young man said a while ago, the young minister here that he backslid and gone away, yet somehow the Holy Spirit still calls. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. for that person when he's in trouble, he's right there with him. Aren't you glad that there's a Holy Spirit that'll chase you like a hound of hell &gt;&gt; and try to woo you and pull you back to true repentance. &gt;&gt; He was as backslid as he ever could have been. And yet Abraham called him brother. And when he heard his brother had been taken, he got down to business then. And he and he starts going after him. And they went all the way to Dan, which is about 150 to 170 miles from from Sodom to Dan. And when they got to Dan, he was already gone again. You remember he was already gone. He was no longer at the gates of Dan. And so he went all the way up into what we now call Lebanon, at least another hundred miles. He's not on in his Maserati. &gt;&gt; He's on a camel. He's not in his private jet. He's walking and riding on a bumpy path. Now nearly 300 miles looking for where Lot and his family have been sold. And God gives him victory. I wished I could tell you about it, but I can't. Read it. God give him victory. This rag tag group. Let me just get this in. Do I have Yeah. Yeah. I got 20 minutes. I'm taking them. &gt;&gt; I'm taking them. &gt;&gt; I'm taking them if it hair lifts the devil and bankrupts hell. And I don't care whether you wash my feet or not. I already washed them this morning. I just want you to know this is like this is serious business to me. I I I don't have any way of telling you what it's been like. And I'm ready for a little of it to be off of my shoulders. &gt;&gt; I I I I've got to I've got to I've got to live too. And I've got to move. I've got to I've got to have a little bit of relief. And I'm trying to get it off of me so that I can have a little bit of relief. And no, I'm nothing. I'm I'm I'm nothing great. &gt;&gt; If I was, I could say this to you in 20 minutes and you'd run and get it all made right. I struggle because I'm nothing and because I only can depend on him and because I spend way more time studying and I make way more notes than I ever would need because I had rather be overly prepared &gt;&gt; than have nothing to say but a parrot's message. &gt;&gt; And he win. They win. They win. They divide themselves by night. Verse 15, he divided himself. He and his servants, which is bond servants, which are indentured servants by night and smoke them and pursued them. And did you know the Bible tells us that exactly how many? 318 servants become an army that defeats five kingdoms. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 318 men. Come on. &gt;&gt; Defeat five of the largest kingdoms known to man at the time. And Abraham says, "You're mine." And he grabs Lot and he takes the spoils. And the king of Sodom says, "I'll give you everything. You can have it all. You can have it all." And Abraham has to come back later, Abram, excuse me, has to come back later and tell him, "I don't want none of your stuff. I didn't come to get the stuff. I came to get my lot. I came to get my nephew. I came to get my loved ones. &gt;&gt; I don't want your gold. I want my loved ones out. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm here. &gt;&gt; That's why you're here. &gt;&gt; We want our loved ones snatched out of the clutches of the house of hell. &gt;&gt; Are you screaming? I hope I am. &gt;&gt; Come on. cuz if I'm not, I need to turn it up and scream a little louder. &gt;&gt; God used 318, a compact mobile strike force and a and a 75 plus year old man named Abram who hadn't even began to get his promises yet. &gt;&gt; He's got a lot more benefits and blessings coming. But they recover. They recover all. They they get the plunder. They get lot They get lots of goods. They get the women and the people and and the non-combatants and just take them all. Just go. And the king of Sodom runs out there in verse 17 and offers him everything he wants. But here's where I want you to go. I want you to go to verse 18 through 20 quickly. And Melzdc, king of Salem, brought forth bread. What did he bring forth? &gt;&gt; What did Melazdc What did Melzdc bring? &gt;&gt; Bread and wine. What did he bring? &gt;&gt; Bread and wine. &gt;&gt; He brought bread and wine. I love it. And he was who? He was the priest of the most high God. He was actually a forerunner of an end time bride because he was not only priest, he was also king. &gt;&gt; And the Bible speaks of the overcomers that they will also function as both priests and kings. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He represents a priesthood that's above the ironic priesthood &gt;&gt; that would later follow. &gt;&gt; In fact, this priesthood of Melzdc is an eternal one. &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us that will never pass away. Hey, there's something going on with this MelzDC, isn't there? &gt;&gt; All right. He brought bread and wine. What did he bring? &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said he brought communion. &gt;&gt; He brought the Lord's supper. &gt;&gt; But there hadn't been a Lord's supper. And there hadn't been a Passover, but there was tithe paying &gt;&gt; and communion. &gt;&gt; Before there was a law, &gt;&gt; before there was instructional &gt;&gt; and he blessed him. He blessed him. And and and blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth. And blessed be the most high God. Are you still here? Blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave them tithes of all. The word melik for for mezazedc. You can say it any kind of way. Just brother Brandham did and you can too. Don't even matter how you say it. Don't even struggle to say Mphibicheth. Just say however you call him Mickey if you need to. Whatever you need to do. If you can't say it, you can still get what it means. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Melik means king. Melik hahaam, king of the whole universe. Melik is king. And Zedic where we get Melzdc de K sometimes spelled with a C is Zadicc. Zedek is righteous. Righteousness. Zadec comes from Zadok. There is a Levitical priesthood. There is a Zadok priesthood. There is a Melzdc priesthood all mentioned in the Bible. The Zadok priesthood operated under a special kind of an anointing and they were able to discern between the holy &gt;&gt; the profane &gt;&gt; and the profane. Right. &gt;&gt; Melzdc was a forerunner of a of a priesthood that would be available to overcoming believers who it would grant them by the full revelation and unveiling apocalypsis of the word. It would grant them the ability to discern between the holy and profane. Not just by first glance, &gt;&gt; right? but by seeing the spirit behind the thing. &gt;&gt; I want you to follow me just another minute or two. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it doesn't look as obvious. &gt;&gt; I've watched sisters come under spirits because they change their hairstyle. Nothing wrong with having a different hairstyle. You all don't have to be Queen Elizabeth and have the same one for 70 years. But what you don't want to do is let the enemy talk you into one &gt;&gt; that makes you appear in some provocative kind of way &gt;&gt; that that attracts like a magnet of spirit that's going to going to have long-term and farreaching effects that Zadok priesthood would not just judge by outward appearance but they would have a an ability to discern the spirit behind. I know you're wore out. &gt;&gt; You you you ought to be me. It's so vitally important. When people first come to the word, they say, "Why does that matter? Why why can't a woman wear the breaches? Why can't Why can't she Why is it not a good idea for a godly woman to wear pajama britches in her in her house?" &gt;&gt; Because the Bible didn't say where you wear it. &gt;&gt; That's right. The Bible said not to wear that which pertainth unto a man. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what he said? &gt;&gt; Is somebody going to go to hell for that? I wouldn't say so. I I don't know. Um I don't allow it in my home. And And so I don't know. I I can't say. But I tell you what I can say. There could very easily be a spirit behind that. &gt;&gt; And the milkman. Nobody has a milkman, do they? Well, you some of you kind of do, but you go get your own milk. But if you if the milkman comes to the door, the next thing you know, you just run out there. There was a time you would have put on a robe, but you got the you're covered up. You got on these pajama bottoms and pants and and you run out there to the milkman and to the door and get your milk. You stand right there dressed like a man pertaining to a man. Don't shout me down. Now go ahead, preach. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "How do pajama pants pertain to a man?" "How do blue jeans pertain to a man?" "How do slacks in general pertain to a man?" &gt;&gt; Big subject here, isn't it? We could talk about the crotch for one thing. We could talk about the division of the uh of the material for one thing, but then we'd have to get on some of the other popular things around the message that at one time they used to wear them under their clothes and now they're getting bolder and bolder and bolder and they're underneath the things they said were only wearing for underneath purposes. Let's see. Watch how quiet it gets. That's right. &gt;&gt; We're only wearing this for undergarments and it's none nobody's business because they're under our clothes. Even though they're like a man, even though they definitely would pertain to a man, we're wearing them under our clothes so nobody cares. And the next thing you know, they start getting longer. &gt;&gt; Watch how quiet they'll get. &gt;&gt; And this and of course the skirt gets shorter because there's no no need because you've got something else to kind of protect. So the skirt comes like this. &gt;&gt; It don't matter cuz you got these things on hanging out down there beneath. And and the one thing I know brother Brandham said was a woman should not show her underneath garment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you're wearing that for modesty, it is an underneath garment and it should stay underneath. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the scripture said pertain. &gt;&gt; Now you're just preaching your conviction. Maybe I'm preaching that there's a spirit, &gt;&gt; an influence behind some of the compromising things that the church keeps adopting. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I wonder where it's going to lead us. I know where we're going to put our hip and our leg and we're going to inch over until the next thing we know we get caught up in a war that's not ours. &gt;&gt; Lot didn't even have any skin in the fight. &gt;&gt; But he he ends up being a captive and hauled off as a prisoner. &gt;&gt; And he could care less what what Sodom He just liked it because there was a big shopping mall. His wife liked it because there were beauty parlors. It it it just seemed like a nice place to hang out. &gt;&gt; And now he becomes a prisoner and hung up. And his old fogy uh uncle Abram &gt;&gt; who said, "You got to go your way and I'll go mine." But he wasn't going to cheat him. So he took him on the mountain. You look out. You take the best. You take the price, the pricey, the most valuable. You take whatever land you want and I'll take the rest. &gt;&gt; What a spirit. What an unselfish spirit he had. &gt;&gt; And now this same one said, "My brother's been taken. I've got to leave everything. I've got to go find him all the way to Dan all the way up to Damascus or wherever he was going." There's something about this Melzdc. He's the king of righteousness. He's the king. 153. No, I didn't fall. Um, there are many might would like that, but I didn't fall. Did not fall. I'm okay. I know it's a loud environment. I live in one. I understand now that that's settled. King of King of Zedic, King of righteousness, King of King of Salem, Salem, which is where I live. Thank the Lord. I live in Salem, Alabama. And I have an apartment in Jerusalem, Israel. Both meaning peace. I love that. I like that. &gt;&gt; This Melzdc wasn't an ordinary priest. He wasn't an ordinary king. Flash this up and we'll stop. We got to get to a point in a minute. We're nearly done. I can't even get you to laugh with me now. Can't get you to smile. Can't get you nod your head. I've offended you and I've drugged you out and I've wore you out and good. You're going to be too tired to come and take communion. So, it'll be a quick short service for the few that show up. Let Let me just read you. I don't have time to read these quotes, but but I I just knew that I wouldn't. So, I summarize them. Please don't think that this is something I I I feel like I'm uh you know um editing the quotes. I'm not. I just took out the main points because he says so many thing about MelzDC. So many things. I want to make sure you know who he is. Can you flash those up? This comes from paragraph 634 of Hebrews chapter 6 series. He said, uh here's some of the things Brother Bram taught us about. He wasn't born. He was just created. &gt;&gt; He was a body that he dwelt in. &gt;&gt; Jesus had a beginning of days and an ending of life. Jesus had both father and mother. This is according to paragraph 634. But Jesus was made after the order of Melzdc. Do you see that? &gt;&gt; All right. The next paragraph, brother Bam tells us Melzdc was God himself, &gt;&gt; not a natural man, &gt;&gt; not a man born of a woman, not a man born at all. He was God himself. He said Melzdc was Jehovah God, the same one that made Abraham that met Abraham years later in front of his tent. &gt;&gt; You see, he wasn't just an ordinary priest or king. Paragraph 639. He was never born. Melzdc. He will never die. Melzdc. It was God. Sure. In the foreshadow in the foreshadow of the Lord Jesus. Do you follow that? But Jesus had to come through a woman. &gt;&gt; He had to come the way that you come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I like it. Through a woman in order to bring you back to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I like it, sir. &gt;&gt; I like that. Uh, I think I skipped 635. Did I? No. Nope. I got it. All right. Never born, never die. All right. Let's go to the next one. Uh, Melzd when Melzdc was on earth, he was Jehovah God made manifest by creation. He was here. But like in a theophony, which is a body created to contain deity, a theophony, some sometimes called a christophony, which is a prefigure or a foreshadow of Christ himself, which we could say about Melzdc. Theophony is fine, but he would have also been Christophan. And in paragraph 306, he was not Jesus. Oh, this oh this is so good. This this this message uh he where he's talking in Hebrews uh chapter 7 number two. This is rich. He was not Jesus for he was God. &gt;&gt; Let's confuse the trinitarians. But before we're done, let's confuse the oneness. He was not Jesus for he was God. Jesus, this is beautifully done. Jesus was the tabernacle that God dwelt in. &gt;&gt; Therefore, Melzdc was not Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just think about it. Let it sink in. Chew it. Wrong wrong. Chew it up. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the tabernacle that God dwelt in. Jesus as a son had a beginning of life. There's no eternal sunship in the revelation of Jesus Christ message. No eternal sunship. So Jesus as a son had a beginning of life. Jesus couldn't be Melzdc. Melzdc couldn't be Jesus. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus had a beginning of life. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; There's no eternal sunship. Melzdc, watch this. [Music] &gt;&gt; Melzdc and Jesus were one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Melzdc could not be Jesus. I love this. It all makes sense. And that's what scares me. &gt;&gt; It makes spiritual sense to me. I I bought that book. I bought that book of of all the uh heresy teachings of William Brandham. I bought that book uh that they use to to beat people and pull them and scare them out of the truth. And I read it. I think I mentioned this because Sister Shosana asked me what did what was in there. And I thought, boy, I got to read this because there's going to be some things in here that's going to shake me. I mean, I know I I know if it if this causes people to run, I better read this book. I I opened it up and I and I read one paragraph. I said, "Oh, yes. Hallelujah. Thank God. I believe that." &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; So, I said, "Let me turn. Let me scoop over here. I believe that with all my heart. I got more persuaded the more I read, the more I shouted. &gt;&gt; And all I could say is, "I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them." &gt;&gt; Because I get this. I get this because it's been quickened. He was not Jesus for he was God. Jesus was the tabernacle that God dwelt in. Jesus as a son had a beginning of life, but it was the self-same person. Melzdc and Jesus were one, but they're not the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, isn't that the same of the Godhead? Father and father and Jesus. &gt;&gt; Aren't they one? One spirit, one essence. &gt;&gt; But not the same office or manifestation, but the same God. Here, O Israel, the Lord. Oh, yeah. Jesus was the earthly body. You should hear this. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the earthly body born and fashioned after sin. God's own body. That is the reason he had a beginning because his body was a body of flesh. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, this is some kind of man. This is some kind of a a and it's powerful. Very very powerful. So, let let me let me finish with this. It's 2 o'clock. Woo. I hope you hope you packed the lunch. You can eat in the car and come on back. Paragraph 59. Now, notice Abraham, there he was. He met MelzDC. Can I have five? Thank you. Five minutes. 10 minutes. Uh, anybody give me 10, 15, 12. Notice Abraham, there he was. And he met Melzdc, which is the king of Salem, king of Jerusalem, king of peace, without father, without mother. And notice, he blessed a Abraham. Listen, he blessed Abraham after. Read it. Read it with me. After the battle was won. When did when did MelzDC meet Abram on the road? After the battle was won. When did Melzdc bless Abram? After the battle was won. When did Melzdc serve bread and wine to Abram? After the battle was won. &gt;&gt; Woo. &gt;&gt; You get it? &gt;&gt; Not till the battle's won. &gt;&gt; Not till the battle's won. I won't eat. I won't drink of this cup until the battle's won &gt;&gt; and then I'll give it to you in the kingdom of my father. &gt;&gt; And notice what he did. He brought out wine and bread and give it to him. Wine and bread is the communion. They took communion after the battle was over. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "I I despise that doctrine of spiritual communion. There there were a bunch of nutsis around the beginning of the ministry, still a few, and they ran around saying, "We we won't take communion anymore. We we shouldn't take communion anymore." Of course, the same folks said we shouldn't uh have sexual relations with our wives anymore. Well, you know, that didn't last because they kept having children. But they never did go back to taking natural elements of communion. There's no such a thing as a as as communion becoming spiritual and we don't need it anymore because Jesus said when the battle's over. &gt;&gt; So So sure, one of these days we're going to take communion again. Find it. Where's that at? Is it in the next? There it is. Sure. One of these days we're going to take what? When &gt;&gt; when we brought back the lost sheep, the lost children, &gt;&gt; the lost sheep of the fold, &gt;&gt; Abram went and got Lot, &gt;&gt; enlarge thy borders, expand thy tent pegs, &gt;&gt; stretch yourself. I heard the Lord yesterday as clear as I have ever heard his voice. I'm walking through my house all by myself. I had of course been in the word most of the day. I'm walking through the house all by myself and I heard the Lord say, "Tell them they weren't ready for the first wave. I sent the exiled and prisoners of war and they were not ready for the first wave. But they better be prepared for the next wave. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "What in the world does that mean?" I'll let you in and the Holy Ghost to see if you can figure that out. But I I get it. I get it. It ain't easy blending communities and bringing different streams together. It ain't easy. But there's some exiles. There's some lost ones, too. Sometimes the the pieces of the of the chess game have to be moved around so that the so that the prisoners so so that those taken captive can can have a place. It's in him. It's in Christ. It's not a geographical location. But God does have a spiritual refuge. He gave us this land and told us it would be. It would be a refuge. I pray it can be. I pray that it will be. I pray that we can be ready for the next wave of prisoners of war. I pray that this communion service tonight will make a difference. &gt;&gt; Sir, one of these days we're going to take communion again when the battle's over. When we brought back the lost children, the lost sheep of the foe, have brought them back into reconciliation. And isn't that the ministry of the bride? Isn't that what the scripture tells us? And I'll give them the ministry of reconciliation &gt;&gt; in so many ways. That's just the continuation of the commission that Brother Brandham operated in. Turning hearts &gt;&gt; back to Christ, &gt;&gt; fathers, children, children, fathers. And you and I, it's our desire to turn hearts back to Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And life is finished. And then we'll have communion again with the Melzdc of heaven, &gt;&gt; Christ. He will bring out the bread and the wine. &gt;&gt; And we'll enjoy it together. &gt;&gt; See, it's more than Passover. It's about more than Passover. It's even about more than the broken body of our Lord. It's about even more than just the blood, the wine that represents the blood. It's about even more than that. It prophesies of a day that you and I will drink this wine with him again in the kingdom. When &gt;&gt; When the battle's over. &gt;&gt; When the battle's over. Abraham's seed, paragraph 46. Musicians are coming. As soon as the battle was over, what did he bring out? Bread and wine. &gt;&gt; Woo! When I take my bread and my wine tonight, I'm first and foremost I'm going to think about the broken body of my Lord. Brother Brandham said it's wrong to believe that communion can save you. &gt;&gt; He said communion has nothing to do with salvation &gt;&gt; because of the doctrine. He said it's not about last rights. The Catholics rush to the hospital to give them the last communion so they can be saved, so they can be sure to go to heaven. He said it's not about salvation. He said it's actually about a commemoration. He said we're commemorating something that has taken place and looking forward to something that will be. I'm going to drink that wine tonight. And yes, it's it's for those of you who've never it's it's not grape juice. Grape juice spoils. Brother Ram said less than 24 hours. It can be nothing but wine. It gets better with age. Is that right? &gt;&gt; And it's not soda cracker. Brother Bram said, "I'm I'm against that. I'm against substituting the Pascal lamb for a soda cracker." &gt;&gt; He said, "It's bread and you don't pick it up with the It's not loaf bread." He said it's bread made by dedicated and consecrated hands, by Holy Ghost hands. &gt;&gt; It means something. &gt;&gt; He tells us in the same manner that the Passover that not any of it could last until the morning. It had to be burned. Brother Bram said, "That's what we do with our with our communion elements, the bread that represents the pascal lamb." He said, "We burn it before the morning to remember. You You're really going to throw out the feast of the Lord and not even use them as great teaching points? &gt;&gt; You're going to accuse people of trying to be Jews because they preach about soot tabernacles and Passover." When brother Brandham said that communion is a commemoration of an annual event that took place with the blood on the doorpost uh in case you need need it. It's in a key to the door and in the message ordination. Let let me read ordination because uh this one says this one says this. He said do you know what communion do you know that communion has divine healing in it? &gt;&gt; Woo. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the Israelites in the type took the communion in March 40 years and when they come out of the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Amen. There wasn't a feeble one among them. Two and a half million people. He said there's power of healing. &gt;&gt; In the communion. Do you know why? Because it not only represents a broken body of our Lord and the shedding of his blood. It also represents the marriage supper of the lamb where there will be no sickness, no pain, no death, no grave, no burden, no sorrow, no heartache. Come on. &gt;&gt; It means this. It prophesies that it's more than unleavened bread and wine. &gt;&gt; There's healing in it. He said in Abraham's seed as soon as the battle was over. What did he bring out? Bread and wine. The communion. They took communion. After the battle was over, let's fight now. Let's fight now. Let's bring back the lost brother. Jesus said, "I'll drink it a new with you in the father's kingdom." When &gt;&gt; he said that a lot after the battle's over. Amen. Melzdc came out, met Abraham, and what did he do? &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Gave him communion. &gt;&gt; In a message called perfection. Yes, I'm squeezing in. &gt;&gt; Who is this king of Salem? The great king of Jerusalem. Not the earthly. Not the earthly. The heavenly. The earthly. Jerusalem is a type of the heavenly. Did you hear that? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are you sure you heard that? &gt;&gt; What's all this talk about Jerusalem? There it is. The earthly is a type of the heavenly in antitype. The heavenly is a type of the earthly. And here come the king of Salem, which is the first king of righteousness, the king of peace. He didn't have any father, didn't have any mother, didn't have any beginning of life. How do we know that? Because the Bible tells us so. And for you that don't know where. Write this down. Write this down. I didn't have time. Hebrews 7 1-3. Read all of seven. Read all of eight. Read part of nine or all of nine. &gt;&gt; And you'll see that this Melzdc is a big deal. He's not God. I mean, he's not Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He's God in spirit and in essence. &gt;&gt; He was more like a theophony body. He was not born. He was created. He was a prefigure of the Lord Jesus Christ. It's powerful. Why? because only Jesus could execute through his death, shedding of blood, and resurrection the eternal life that would be necessary to get us all the way through to the millennium. And and in verse three, Hebrews there uh Hebrews uh 7:3 it said, "Without father, without mother, without descent, without descent, he had he had no ancestry, having neither beginning of days, but made like unto the son of God." And like like Psalms said, he abideth. Read it. And in that message, perfection. Oh my. Without a descent. None other than Christ himself. This is 88. None other than Christ himself. That's who the church meets when they go up in the air. And when Abraham met him, he gave him tithe of all that he possessed. No wonder he did. He recognized this man is not of the earth. &gt;&gt; There's something about this man. He has brought me coming back. He's met me coming back from the slaughter of the king. He doesn't chastise me or condemn me for the blood on my feet. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He just serves me bread and wine. And all I know is I fall down and I have to give him tithe of everything that I possess. And I'm glad he did. And so was Levi &gt;&gt; because it was accounted unto Levi &gt;&gt; for paying tithes while he was yet in the loins. Glory be to God. This word is rich. none other than Christ. That that's who the church meets when they go. And when they, you know what they did? The first thing they did was sat down. He said, "I feel really emotional." Sat down and broke bread and drank wine and taken the communion. When? When? &gt;&gt; I want to hear you scream that after the battle's over. &gt;&gt; It ain't over yet. &gt;&gt; It potentially. potentially it's over. But we're still having to appropriate &gt;&gt; some victory every day. &gt;&gt; I have to choose every day. &gt;&gt; My emotions demand that I have to choose every day self-control. &gt;&gt; Do you ever have to do that? Do you ever have to exercise self-control when your emotions get out of whack? Do you ever have to do that? You ever want to be mad? Does Brother Greley ever make you mad? Don't answer that. Do you ever feel mad? Do you ever feel mad? You ever feel like things are just rotten around you at times? You just get upset and and you have to choose self-control. &gt;&gt; You ever want to just throw up your hands and quit all of it? Do you know how many times in 50 years I've resigned? Do you know how many times in 35 years of pastoring this church alone and visiting 64 nations of the world in person to preach the gospel? Do you know how many times I've wanted to just quit? Do do you know how many times I've just decided that people just ain't worth it? You say, "Well, you're just a heathen." You have no right to be up there preaching to us. If you think that people aren't worth it, let me tell you something. Any of us can go through the long dark night of the soul. &gt;&gt; Any of us can reach a crisis. Any of us can go through a a a second childhood kind of kind of uh you know what do they call that? Uh uh maleopause. No menopause. Men menopause. Midlife crisis. That's right. What do you just think? And while some of us just sit around and think, I like speed. I need speed. I want speed. I want the wind flopping through my brother Stephen. He just does it. He just does it while we sit on the sidelines and say, "Oh, I'd love to feel that." But I I personally have no intention. I'm not going to ride a bicycle either, so I'm certainly not going to ride a motorcycle, but I I feel the need sometime. I see the thrill. I wouldn't jump out of a perfectly good airplane, but I understand that you come to places in your life where you feel like, I just need another thrill. I just need another something. You know, I just I just And people are just trouble. Sheep stink. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm a sheep. I know. I know how we stink. But I have to exercise self-control. You reckon in 50 years the devil's ever said, "Why don't you just get drunk and forget it all?" You're not going to tell us you have heard that. Oh yes. Maybe that's why we go 5 years without taking communion. Cuz I'm afraid of what a sip will do. But I have to exercise self-control because it's worth it to choose him and to keep choosing him and to keep choosing his people and to keep choosing to do what you were born to do. It's worth it in the end because one day after the battle is over, &gt;&gt; the Mechazedc of heaven is going to serve this little bride bread [Music] &gt;&gt; and wine. &gt;&gt; Woo! I can't not make it. I can't afford to give up now. &gt;&gt; I got to fight. &gt;&gt; The victory doesn't come till after the battle. &gt;&gt; Would you stand? Lord, help us. &gt;&gt; Strengthen us. &gt;&gt; We can't slow down &gt;&gt; until after the battle. All right. &gt;&gt; We must prepare our hearts to receive refugees of spiritual warfare. Broken, bruised, moping, tattered eagles. Calcium deposits have nearly choked out their brea their breathing ability. Their talons brittle and broken and bloody. They're in the greatest battle ever fought. And once in a while we have this moment to remember his broken body. and his blood and it prophesies forward while reminding us of what he has done and it is supposed to give us I can maybe show you read it a little bit tonight maybe it's supposed to give us the boost we get our eyes out there on that moment when the battle's over and it's supposed to give us a lift I can fight on for the moment, for the moment, for the moment, for the moment that he slides the cup across the table and says, "Take a big drink." I told my disciples I wouldn't taste it until I could taste it with all of my disciples, with all of my wife, with all of my sons in the new kingdom. And now the battle's over and we're going to sit down at that table spread a million miles and testify how we made it over. The preachers do a great job reminding us that there will be those who say, "What age did you come out of?" And you'll say, "Leodysa." And somebody might look across and say to you, Leodysia, the most evil of all the ages, how did you hold on? How did you make it all the way? If you would have said this age or that age or Philadelphiaian age, but but you said Leodysia, the most evil, how did you make it over? And your answer will be the same as the Ephesian bride and the Thyaran bride and the Sardissian bride and the all that Pergamian bride. all a little bride. It'll be the same. &gt;&gt; By the blood of the lamb, &gt;&gt; by the grace of almighty God, &gt;&gt; by the word of my testimony, &gt;&gt; I've made it over. I've got my eye on the kingdom. Do you have your eye on the kingdom? &gt;&gt; Would you just bow your head a moment while your eye is on the on the on the Lord Jesus Christ? And the spirit of God would woo you in this moment if possible. If you're not so weary, so tired, you can't hear his pull, and maybe you'll find faith to respond. I feel like the Lord is reaching out to us in this pivotal moment in in in this divine pivot in this moment of of reset in this turning point as we keep hearing in our nation. May this little church, may this little people, this faith community, may we have our turning point. May we have our divine pivot. May we may we drive our stakes down deeper &gt;&gt; into the ground. May we have greater determination to choose Christ and his righteousness today and again tonight and again tomorrow and again the next day and again the next day. When we feel like giving up, may we realize that after the battle's over and the victory is ours, there'll no longer be a reason to even think of giving up. Keep your eye on the prize, your hand on the plow. &gt;&gt; Yes. And press on. I wrestled all night one night many years ago in the prayer chapel with a young man who had moved here from the Carolas with his little family. God showed me that night in vision that he was going to make a choice in the near future that would cause his hand to slip off the plow. But in that vision, I saw as the strap of that beast of burden caught on his leg and the beast of burden drug him through the field. I hadn't thought of that vision in a long time. That poor man has suffered and paid such a price for the foolish decision that he made. But as I was going through old papers, I found a file. this week, Joshua. That was what I was carrying this morning. And I and I I started looking through those loose papers and I saw there the vision and the date and the night that we wrestled in the prayer chapel and I said,"I see my brother Randy and he has taken his hand off the plow and I saw that beast of burden dragging him through the field and it makes you want to scream, "Oh brother, don't you turn loose of the plow now? Hold on. The battle is soon over and the cup will be in your hand. Don't you dare give up or give in. Now, if you're here and you've been feeling this uh divine frustration in your spiritual life, that there's more for you, that you've got to pull up a little higher, that you've got to run on a little farther, that there is something else that God would have you to do. If you've been experiencing that in this season, I want you to come right now. We don't have to play soft music. We don't have to sing a sweet song. All we have to do is invite you to come. There's nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed about. In fact, the scripture says, "At the noise of thy water spouts, the deep calleth to the deep." There are times that we walk satisfied, justified, feeling good and clean before the Lord, like we have finally won some victory. I thank God for those seasons. I thank God for those moments where you know that it's not you, it's him. All you did was say yes. But then there are those moments of eb and flow. You can play now something soft. Those moments of eb and flow where you no longer feel the confidence that you once felt. In fact, you feel like the limb that you've been hanging on to is about to fall off the tree. And the only way you can survive is to reach up and take a hold of a higher limb. In doing so, my brother, sister, you climb a little higher. &gt;&gt; You get up a little higher. Oh God, take us higher. Oh God, give us eagle's wings. Take us a little higher. May your divine frustration, may the deep calling to the deep not be something that turns you off or causes you to run the other direction. May it be a zeal pulling you. May it be the wooing of the Holy Spirit. [Music] May it just be an invitation. Press on saints. Press on my brother. Press on my sister. It's not your perfection. It's his. It's not your righteousness. It's his. It's not even your zeal. It's his. It's not your burden. It's his. And if you really see it all the way through, the battle's not even yours. It's like God told little David, "The battle belongs to the Lord." David said, "This isn't our battle. This is the Lord's battle." [Music] If that great magnet is passing over your head and you're feeling an upward pull, yield it. Yield to it. Carry me, Lord. When I can't walk myself &gt;&gt; carry me, Lord. This is the time when true worshippers [Music] will worship him. These are the days when the father's ways will be known to man in ways they've never been known before. Will you press on? Will you go so your children can go? Will you go so your grandchildren can go? Will you swear off today? lukewarm Christianity. Will you begin today to despise the comfort zone that has held you for so long? &gt;&gt; And will you press? &gt;&gt; Will you press? Instead of standing here thinking of what a price I've paid, may it leave my mind and may I calculate a way. May I compute a way to pay a greater price. Lord Jesus. Oh God, I've wasted so much time in 50 years of ministry. [Music] I can't get it back. There have been times I coasted when I should have been climbing, but I can't get it back. It haunts me. It started haunting me when I turned 50. And that was seven years ago. It still haunts me today. The only hope I have is that he gives grace to redeem the time. I want to dig deeper, ditches. I want to put my shoulder to the plow and press harder than I've ever pressed before. [Music] I don't have much patience for petty criticisms and silly whinings, but I have a burden and a zeal to see a people overcome their issues and then reach down and pick up somebody else and say, "If I got out of it, you can. If I escaped the slime pit, you can. If God delivered me from pornography, if God delivered me from this or that or the other, I know he can deliver you. How many of you want to be that helping hand to rescue a fallen brother so that when the battle's over, [Music] Father's ways will be known to men. And this is the hour when the spirit's power will move again across this land as we worship him in spirit and in truth. This is the time when true worshipers will worship him. &gt;&gt; And these are the days when my father's ways will be known. &gt;&gt; Oh, church as usual. &gt;&gt; I'm going to have more. Since the hour when the spirit's power it will move again across this land. Oh, as we worship him in spirit and in truth. Search us today, Lord. Search our hearts. Oh, this is the time when true worshipers will worship. &gt;&gt; These are the days when my father's ways will be known to me. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. This is the hour when the spirit's power will move again across this land as we worship him in spirit and in truth. Just hold the song. Don't sing for a minute. Keep playing. [Music] I want you to tell the Lord. I want you to tell the Lord something. Tell him what you need. Tell him what your determination is. Tell him what your consecration is. Tell him what your new dedication is. Will you do it right now? You don't have to do it so that anyone else can hear. Would you make a covenant with him? Would you make a covenant with him right now? Don't let it be that our hours together today would would take us back instead of setting us forward. Make a commitment to him. It's not between you and your preacher. It's between you and your savior. Lord, help me to run on. Tell him what your desire is. Ask for his help. Don't stand in his presence and make any excuse. Just say yes. If you don't know what to pray, just say yes, Lord. Whatever. Whatever you call me, whatever you tell me, whatever you lead me from your word, whatever you need from me. [Music] That'd be a good starting place if somebody would just tell him, "Lord, what is it you need from me? I'm willing to give it right now. [Music] Don't let this opportunity pass you by. This is the prerequisite. [Music] Let him give you a fresh vision, a fresh zeal. Let him give you a new glimpse of what eternity waits. [Music] Tell him, "I'll work on. I'll pray on. I'll run on. I'll shout on. I'll rejoice on. I'll weep on. [Music] But the one thing I will never do is quit." Tell him. &gt;&gt; Your general wants to hear from you today. He wants to hear from somebody. I won't quit. &gt;&gt; Tell him. &gt;&gt; I will not quit. &gt;&gt; I will not quit. &gt;&gt; I'll I'll fight till the battle's over. I won't let the world charm me. I won't let the world vex me and pull me. And hypnotize me. I'll do whatever I have to do to cut off its influence. I'll stand like a warrior and defend and fight for my family. I'll fight for my family. I'll fight for my family. I'll fight for the fallen brother. I'll fight for the fallen sister. I'll get over my hurts. I'll get rid of my woundedness and I'll put my eyes on the prize. He wants to hear that from some of you. And I wouldn't care if you'd scream it out. I wouldn't care. You don't have to, but I wouldn't care if you just raise your voice and say, "Yes, Jesus." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't care. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't care if somebody else would just say, "Yes, &gt;&gt; I'll press. I'll fight on." Even if it feels like the whole world is pushing against me, &gt;&gt; I'll put my eye on the prize. His name is Jesus. &gt;&gt; He's worth the surrender. &gt;&gt; Has anybody found him worth the surrender? &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord. Come here, Benjamin. Let me pray for you. &gt;&gt; He's worth the surrender. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, a fresh dedication, &gt;&gt; fresh consecration. I've seen what you've been doing in his life, Lord, &gt;&gt; and I celebrate you. I rejoice at his surrender. &gt;&gt; Oh God, take him &gt;&gt; to deeper places, &gt;&gt; to higher heights. [Music] &gt;&gt; Reveal yourself, Lord, in new and fresh ways. Lay your hand on somebody near you. Take my brother. Take my sister. &gt;&gt; Take them deeper. Take them higher. [Music] &gt;&gt; I didn't want anybody here to feel like I'm preaching you lost. Jesus, &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching you're lost. I'm preaching you're found, &gt;&gt; but not by your righteousness or mine. The church has got to push on [Music] &gt;&gt; as we worship him &gt;&gt; in spirit and in truth. I'm aware I'm aware of the late hour. [Music] Oh, this is the time when true worshiper [Music] Sing it. And these are the days other's ways will be known to me. &gt;&gt; Let this be the day. And this is the hour when the spirit's power will move again across this land as we worship him. &gt;&gt; That's right. In spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Wave your hand at him. Wave your hand, somebody. Here I am, Lord. I surrender. &gt;&gt; I surrender my stubbornness. [Music] &gt;&gt; Somebody tell him you're tired of being stubborn. You're ready to be bendable and moldable and pliable. &gt;&gt; These are the days. &gt;&gt; Tell him I'm tired of carrying this chip on my shoulder. &gt;&gt; I'm ready to be out from under the heaviness. &gt;&gt; Come out here, Lord. This is the hour. I surrender. Spirit's power. I surrender. We'll move again across across this land. &gt;&gt; I surrender &gt;&gt; as we worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; I surrender. I surrender. I surrender. I surrender. I surrender. This is the time and worshipers we worship. [Music] [Laughter] And these are the days when my father's ways will be known to me. I surrender. And this is surrender &gt;&gt; when the spirit's power will move again across this land &gt;&gt; as we worship him. Tell him somebody in truth. Tell him &gt;&gt; just another minute. Helen. Oh, this is the time when trueers will worship him. &gt;&gt; These are the days in my father's way will be known to you. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, you heard your cry. [Music] This is the hour. Honor, Lord. Honor, honor. Honor that Lord. You said you would. &gt;&gt; You said you would lost this land as we were. &gt;&gt; You said you would. It's our heart that cries in truth. &gt;&gt; Oh, I press on. I sail on. I believe on. This is the time when we worship &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; And these are the days. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Then my father's ways will be known to men. Oh yes. And this is the hour when the spirit's power it will move again all across this land as we worship you in spirit and in oh we prepare our hearts for this week into thy my chamber be free. Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; bless our precious nature to me as I close the door &gt;&gt; from the Netherlands. Lord, &gt;&gt; finally to us that not &gt;&gt; visit them this week covered. Visit him in ways that you never have before. And he is all. &gt;&gt; May they know you in the power of your resurrection.

Sustain them unending is all I long for. [Music] Now on my pathway though I press falls heavy but it's bringing forth only the best of the wine. So I pressed for the mark for the prize of high calling to be a part of that beautiful bride and into thy chamber. Do it. &gt;&gt; Roll us over the tide. Roll.

Isn't he good? &gt;&gt; I I said, isn't he good? &gt;&gt; He's so good. He's so good. [Applause] It's 3:00 2:52. Um, we can't change that now, can we? So, need no need to talk about it. I want you to turn to somebody and greet them wholeheartedly. Hug them tight if it's appropriate to do so. If it's not, don't do it. In a moment when the spirit of the Lord's moving like that, you could just hug anybody. Wouldn't be any gender, would you? You'd just hug a sister like you would a brother. But we don't want to get in the habit of that. We're setting an example. Pray for the strength of these musicians for the week ahead. Slip to your seats as you can. We won't terry. It's time to be back. Just a couple things. I appreciate any visitor who understands our position this evening. Be seated just a moment. Brother Brandon was always so good and faithful to say that this is a open communion. So I sure have felt terrible about doing anything different. But uh there was a bit of an assignment that came from the Lord and I'd rather please him and be done. I hope no one will be offended. We will gather back. Do you think we can do it at 6? It's 3 hours. You all seem so excited. Well, let's do it at five then. Will that excite you more? I'm ready. We could do it now for all I care and be done. go and get some lunch and uh if not fast, do that. Let's come back at six o'clock. We'll have a moment or two of worship, a few comments, and we will receive communion and the washing of the saints feet. If you're unsure about whether you should be here or not, just I'll be glad to answer any question that you have. I've tried to make myself available through this week. You know, you know, there's just a couple things I have mentioned and one is you should have, you should be baptized. Brother Brandham says clearly, you should be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. You should do that before communion. Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; Uh oh, I forgot that. live. Baniah's birthday is on the 7th, too. Is that right? Wow. He hasn't made it to the calendar yet. One year old on October the 7th. Is that right? That's redemption for an ugly day. Not my daughter's birthday, but uh terrible things have taken place. May it soon be over. Those poor families have their loved ones home, dead or alive, they would desire to have them home regardless. I was going to read it to you quickly. I was going to say, I don't know, Sister Darthy, I I want you to know you may not be able after this long service, but if you're able, I would love for you to be here this evening. You're so welcome. You faithfully, when you're not able to be here, you faithfully support the work of the Lord. I appreciate it. Uh I'll get in a minute. It's on the app, isn't it? Yes, pastor, it is. In Future Home, 1964, August the 2nd, Brother Brandham says boldly, "No man, no person, no woman, boy, girl, I don't care who he is, is fit to go in the pull pit or even claim to be a Christian without being filled with the Holy Ghost." Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, that's not to offend anybody. That's to drive you to want him &gt;&gt; and to be filled with him. You have no right to the Lord's supper or anything until you've been cleansed by the holy fire of God. I would prefer that you all get the baptism of the Holy Ghost now. &gt;&gt; Amen. rather than later if you don't know. But if you have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you're part of this local assembly. You support it with your attendance and your and your uh giving and your prayers and you're here and you know what's being preached and you follow what's going on. It would be an honor to serve you communion and the washing of the saints feet tonight. other otherwise you streamers this is your church it's not ideal it's not ideal to have a pastor hours away but if this is your position now and and and you claim this church as yours of course please come and let us serve you communion and footwashing otherwise we're just going to keep it for this local body this evening it grieves me to do it that that way, but we will in obedience. If you've been baptized, now they ask about children. Brother Brandham said, "If a child is old enough to ask to be baptized, he's old enough to be baptized." That doesn't mean he understands or she understands all there is to understand about it. It just means they've got the desire. You talk to them about it and they're willing to go through with it and then they're bapt you baptize them. That's the right thing to do. That doesn't mean that later they might understand more and want to be baptized. So you may see some younger ones come through and receive the communion. It will be because they have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Please parents, if you're children or teenagers or whatever have not been baptized, please don't uh don't uh in push them or encourage them to receive the communion. They can come through in the line with you. It's all right. Family sticking together. It's beautiful. There will be for the first time in 35 years, there will be a little tray down here with some little glass cups for those of you who feel for some reason you would like to take one. I had a precious person reach out in a nice well-written email strongly urging me to change the communion policy which I have no intention of doing whatsoever. It is if we understand what brother said. He said it was Passover. You read the scriptures. He handed them the cup. He told them to divide it among themselves. that means get your sip. But I understand that there are concerns that people have. So So for the like I said, the first time in 35 years, I didn't buy some little fancy tray to put them in because I I was going to because I didn't want anybody to feel like they weren't special if they chose that. But it was going to be $59 to have a little tray with holes in it. And I just said, "No, I'm going I'm not I'm not going to I'll There'll be a little tray. There'll be little glass cups. You be sure if you feel to Don't be condemned. Don't be judged. Don't it it's between you and the Lord. Nobody has any right to say anything or think anything. If you to take that little cup, you take it. It's there. I filled it up for you if you want it. But I receive communion with a common cup and I serve it with a common cup. And God has been good to us. &gt;&gt; There was a period of time where there was a sister who worshiped with us who had been diagnosed with hepatitis C. We knew it. She knew it. I even went to one of the doctor's appointments. So I knew that it was the case from her years of needle abuse. In that moment, there was a challenge. What will we do? What will we do? What will we do? And we decided to continue on doing it as we had always done it before. Was she allowed to take communion? Are you kidding me? She needed it. She needed it more than most of us. It's possible that the first time I may have had a little towel and I may have done that to few few people come through. I think I might have. I don't remember. But I I want you to know that don't do much, make you feel better. Brother Brandham said there's divine healing in communion. &gt;&gt; And I I just believe it when we pray over that. I just believe. But I want you to do as you feel. It'll be there for you. And I mean this now. If I hear of one person saying anything negative about somebody who took that little cup, you're going to get a tongue lashing from me because that would not be right. You come with your conviction. You take whichever you feel and don't find it necessary to comment, to grunt. &gt;&gt; I think some of you know I mean it. &gt;&gt; Don't grunt. Don't gasp. Don't just say, "Praise God. They're they're taking the wine." &gt;&gt; Don't ever let it bother you a bit. I don't know how long we will do that, but this evening we will. it'll be there. So, if you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, if you have active uh sin, if you're you are participating, you're gambling, Brother Brandham specifically mentioned some of those things, if you're involved in those kinds of things, please do your best to to repent, get that right, and make up your mind you're bigger than that by the grace of God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Don't come through and take it and just say, "Well, I'm going to just throw myself on the mercies of God." You're on the mercies of God. Now, &gt;&gt; you tempt him, then you are discerning his body unworthily. You're taking that unworthily, not properly discerning his body. And the Bible said scripture 1 Corinthians 11, brother Brandham really expounds on it multiple times. You many are sick among you for that reason and some sleep. And I don't think that applies to you nap takers in church. &gt;&gt; I think that means a little more than that. I don't believe in trying to make people fearful. But the very reason why it's been five years is because when it becomes common, people will walk through, strut their shoulders, and not even think about what they're doing, and it means nothing. Brother Brandham said, "You've made it a tradition." I found a quote where Brother Brandham said, "I don't even believe in in in saying I'm going to do it the second Sunday or the first Sunday." He said, "When you do that, you've made it a tradition. &gt;&gt; It should be of greater importance and deeper value than that." Do you understand? &gt;&gt; If you're waiting to feel perfect or feel worthy or feel righteous, you'll wait another five years and and beyond. But if you will put your hand, here's the key. Put your hand on the head of your lamb. [Laughter] and have fellowship with your sacrifice and say, "Lord, I ought to crawl on my belly through the line. But because you paid the price, &gt;&gt; I'm going to take and I'm going to believe that it'll be a turning point in my life." &gt;&gt; Let's come back. 6 o'clock, you're dismissed to go in the name of the Lord. If you have a question, an important question concerning the communion service, I will sit here just a few minutes before I go out. Once I go out, I'm out. But I'll sit here for just a few minutes. I believe that many of you have made a fresh start with the Lord, and I believe you're going to feel and see the difference. &gt;&gt; Please love on our visitors. So glad some of them would get to worship with us a night or two this week. Tonight at 6, just stay right there, darling. Stay right there, Nora. I'm coming down. Stay right there. Tonight at 6, Tuesday night at 7 o'clock, we start. God bless you as you leave this evening.
