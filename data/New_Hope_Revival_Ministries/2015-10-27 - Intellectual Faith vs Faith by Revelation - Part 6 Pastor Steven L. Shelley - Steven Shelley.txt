we'd like for you to visit it uh take advantage of some of the Articles and prophecies and uh wonderful things that are there I want to just strengthen you in some way and I believe our website is one of the ways one of the tools that God has given us to be able to do that we can't always be where you are but thank God for the technology that helps us to visit from time to time and that's what we're doing today we're closing our Series today on uh the difference between uh intellectual Faith a mental concept of faith and what we call Spirit revealed Faith or Faith by Revelation you know when we look at the scripture uh in the book of Hebrews and and we read about the faith we call that the Hall of Faith chapter Hebrews uh uh chapter 11 and we read about all those great men of God by Faith by faith this one by faith that one well let's do it um I think we have time to glance at it uh I wasn't going to read it but let's let's just look there Hebrews chap 11 there's some amazing uh testimonies here that I love so much it starts off with the definition of faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen and then it goes on by faith Abel by faith Enoch by faith Noah by faith Abraham uh it goes on it talks a lot about Abraham by faith Jacob by faith Joseph by faith Moses and it talks quite a bit about the Ministry of Moses and then it comes to the end and and he said what shall I say more for the time would fail me to tell you of Gideon of Barack of Samson David and Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness this is verse 33 obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed Valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were saw aunder were tempted were slain with a sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented listen at verse 38 of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and mountains and dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receed not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not not be made perfect and the next verse is so powerful because it talks about that great cloud of witnesses what cloud is he talking about what Witnesses is he talking about all of these mentioned and and described in the great chapter of Faith the Hall of Faith Hebrews chapter 11 I want you to know in order to face the circumstances that these men and women faced they needed more and just a mental concept of belief of Faith they needed a deep Revelation and I've often preached from Hebrews 11 and I've said you could easily replace that word faith you could say by Revelation Enoch was translated by Revelation Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain um by Revelation they passed through the Red Sea by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents we could say by Revelation because this is the kind of faith that doesn't come by just receiving facts or by information it comes as a work of the Holy Spirit and and I'm just asking the Lord I've been asking him during this series uh that he would take your faith to another level that he would just speak to you by his spirit and and let your think so your hope so your maybe so become I know so a deep Foundation of Faith um we were studying Peter in this series so I want to tie that in here now uh and kind of close with Peter because we talked about a lot of things we talked about Peter's denial we we talked about how Peter rebuked the Lord and how he denied his relationship with the Lord we talked about how God gave Peter a real revelation of who he was and then we talked about in Acts chapter 2 when what Peter really needed was the infusion of God's life that he received on the day of Pentecost in the upper room because Peter went from a denier to a testifier I mean he stood up with boldness and courage and said wait a minute this these men are not drunk as you suppose this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel and he went on and said you know this Jesus that you have taken and done what you wanted to do with him and crucified him uh he was the promised Messiah and and Peter in Acts chapter 2 goes through some of the Messianic prophecies of the prophets and he says this was him this was him so he did a bold thing to to testify to all those who were gathered in Jerusalem and I love that because it speaks of that transformation that took place in his life and there's something special that that goes in between his denial and his great sermon in in the book of Acts in Chapter 2 and it it has to do with the resurrection so I wanted to share that to kind of just close this off with Peter for this study in Mark chapter 16 beginning in verse one it says and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the Mother of James and salom had brought bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the supper at the rising of the Sun and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the Stone from the door of the Seiler and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great so they were worried about who would help them get that stone out of the way when they arrived there very early in the morning he was already risen we understand that the the Jewish Day you know the biblical day starts with the sun uh when the Sun goes down a new day begins not when the sun comes up the next morning so when the Sabbath was passed that would have been at sundown so somewhere between Sundown and when the and when these ladies get to the Tomb at Sunrise something has already happened and the stone is already moved out of the way and entering into the Seiler verse 5 Mark 16 they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were arried and he saith unto them be not afed ye seek Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified he is risen Hallelujah I I can't say it without feeling it because it's some of the best news that's ever been spoken in the history of the world he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him but go your way tell his disciples and Peter that he go before you into Galilee there shall ye see him and he said unto you and they went out quickly and fled from the Seiler for they trembled and were amazed neither said they anything to any man for they were afraid now I've heard amazing sermons preached from these verses of scripture and I've heard people say oh he called out to his disciples but he separated Peter over here as a backslider the disciples and Peter because Peter was no longer a disciple I don't believe that at all I believe that this was a very special call to Peter I believe that Jesus had so much compassion for for the failure and the effect of the failure on Peter's life he went out bitterly when the words of the Lord came to pass and the rooster uh let out his big old cockadoodle doo and and it broke his heart heart and he could have easily given up but I believe the Lord Jesus after he was raised from the dead was issuing a special call to Peter come back to your destiny son you you blew it you certainly failed but I knew you were going see after all that didn't catch the Lord by surprise what Peter did was exactly what God knew he was going to do he even told him ahead of time uh when by by the time the cross you will have already denied me three times and Peter you know he already had this overconfidence in himself not so you know all men may be offended at you Lord but I will never be offended and everyone will may deny you but I would never deny you I'm willing to go with you even unto death that was a confession based on what Peter thought he knew about his faith that was a mental conception but Peter needed the upper room and this is exactly what Jesus was doing after the resurrection he was calling Peter to the upper room you go tell my disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee there you shall see him as he said unto you don't leave Peter out and and so for me this is so encouraging because I have failed him along the way and I'm sure that maybe you have to if you've been serving him for any amount of time and Jesus wanted to make sure that Peter didn't miss his invitation to meet him in the Galilee and so for me it was not an exclusion it was actually a royal invitation you go tell my disciples and Peter basically he's saying Peter get back to your destiny call you've wallowed around in your self-pity from the way you failed and how you Den not you have just graveled around in that long enough Peter get up to Galilee I want to see you I'm looking forward to meeting you there and and I just believe the same thing is going on even in this hour that God is issuing a call let it be today through this Eagle cry broadcast that God is issuing a call someone failed someone Fallen by the way and you've just nearly given up and there's a call going forth to you today get up get out of your self-pity get out of that shame and condemnation maybe you've really embarrassed yourself maybe you've embarrassed your family maybe you've failed in Ministry and and so you just give up might as well just give up now no you might as well not give up you might as well let your faith be elevated and anointed to get a hold of a promise that will hold you when you no longer have the strength to hold on to it these are the precious promises that God has given us in our life so real so sure um we the the Bible talks about us having a more excellent way a provided way that is more excellent for us and I am so thankful to be walking in God's provided way for my life even when I do miss his his call uh there are times that I I I I try to hear his voice in certain areas but I miss it and it I hope it doesn't happen often but when it happens we're you're you're just filled with guilt you feel so terrible that you miss the Lord and and so what an encouragement that Jesus made this special call to Peter get up boy dust yourself off just like we say to our children when something like that happens and we're so afraid that because they fell off their bicycle they'll never get back on a bicycle again because we've seen that happen and so we say to them you get up right now and let me help dust you off and and and let me soothe your wounds let me wash your cuts and then I want you to get right back up on that bicycle and ride again and I believe the Lord you know the one thing that I know I know lots of things about him because he's made them real in my life but one of the things I appreciate about him so much is he's the god of Second Chances and he allows you turns and when you realize that you are going in the wrong direction you have an opportunity to hear his call and to turn around and come back let me give you an example in the scripture uh as we finish up this series on really we're not just comparing the two faiths we're saying that we need a transformation from from one faith that mental Faith to to a spirit revealed Faith um brother Brandon was preaching along those lines one time and he said we just need the streams of Grace the rivers of Grace to pour down on our intellect ual faith our mental faith and transform it into a faith that is Spirit revealed that will not uh give up when the when the details and when the circumstances are ugly Luke chap 24 and verse 13 I think I have time to read these verses and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emus which was from Jerusalem three score furlongs and they walked together uh and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned Jesus himself Drew near and went with them can you imagine but their eyes were Holden that they should not know him and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that you have one to another as you walk and are sad and the one of them whose name was Copus answered and said unto him art th th only a stranger in Jerusalem and Hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty in deed and word before God and all the people they didn't even realize they're talking to him and how the chief priest and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done what the third day he had just risen from the dead and was now appearing to them verse 22 Y and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the Seiler we just read it and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the separer and found it even as the women had said but him they saw not then he said unto them this is the Lord now speaking to these two men on the road to Emmas oh fools and slow to heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ ought not Messiah to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and then listen at what he did he began to preach to them he began to minister to them verse 27 said and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all the scriptures the things concerning himself can you imagine it was like a bible school with Jesus himself the word made flesh just teaching them all the scriptures and how to connect them together about his own Ministry Ministry and verse 28 and they drew nigh unto the village with they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went into Terry with them it came to pass he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break it and gave to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scripture do you hear what was happening it was a revelation they now began to understand when he gave them that physical bread when they took that bread it was blessed and they took it it it created this whole scenario created an atmosphere for Revelation they're not just hearing it taught by the good scribes by the good priest they're hearing it taught by the word himself and the spirit is there to make it real I'm telling you they really realized just a second or two uh too late I I guess that this was the one and and they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the 11 gathered together and them that were with them saying the Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in the breaking of bread I want you to understand what was happening here Jesus found this couple of guys one day walking uh from Jerusalem to the little village out uh near emus we call that the area uh of today near abos it is a village built near the the scriptural Place uh kirat yahim it's a very beautiful place just outside the city you can go up on the hill uh at Karat yharim and see over into Jerusalem it's just one Hill away from the city of Jerusalem and they're walking in that Direction and they're filled with doubt they're filled with in uncertainty because here they believed that this Jesus was the one that the scriptures had spoken about now they watched him die and and crucified and suffer and everything within them is being shaken filled with uncertainty so much so that when they heard this testimony that he was risen from the dead they didn't even know whether to believe believe it or not what a dilemma they were in and we know this because they were going in the wrong direction the word of the Lord was not for them to leave Jerusalem this wasn't a time for them to run in the other way this was a time to stick around and see what was about to take place but they were so shaken and so mentally and emotionally exhausted that they're walking in the wrong direction from Jerusalem they're headed somewhere else perhaps back to their home but the promise was that they should stick around TR around in Jerusalem uh to see what was going to happen because there was power coming and so forth and but they were in essence fleeing away not knowing what to expect and their hopes were kind of dashed and destroyed but I love the fact that Jesus loved those men he loved Copus he loved the other man that was with him so much that he went and found them going in the other direction and that's what I started off a moment ago saying that God allows you turns and sometimes in our discouraging circumstances we sit down and we're not active in doing what God has called us to do and like Peter he failed he dealt with it it was hard and he wasn't really up doing what he ought so Jesus just said go tell my disciples and Peter and the same kind of Mercy he showed here to these two men on the road to emus they didn't come and find him they heard the testimony that he was risen but they didn't stick around to see if it was so or not they were going home now I want you to know something I don't know but I think in my mind if ID have heard this testimony I would have wanted to to to go here and there up and down every street in Jerusalem and see if this were true to prove that indeed he had risen but they are so broken so emotionally spent that they're just going home uh not even staying around to investigate these testimonies of his resurrection but Jesus loved them so much that he went and found them and he he wouldn't even tell them who he was immediately their eyes were kind of blinded to be able to see who he really was and after he made himself known then they said yes indeed did not our hearts burn within us as he talked with us by the way what I see in this story is the love that Jesus has for those who get disillusioned for those who get disappointed for those who want to give up for those who make mistakes and fail his love ever Burns for people like that that's the Jesus that we know one who is more ready to forgive if you ask more ready to restore if you will allow him to than he is to to just disregard your life you see when he called us he knew us in and out up and down all the way around he knew our our qualities he knew our strengths he knew our gifts he also knew our weaknesses he knew our predispositions to sin he knew generational iniquities that followed us that chased us in our lives he knew the end from the beginning the beginning from the end and yet he loved us and yet he called us and he has every intention of continuing to move in our lives and work in us and with us and through us until we become the Glorious reflection of His Image we're growing in this thing I want you to know we go from strength to strength from Grace to Grace from Faith to Faith I like the old testimony that I've heard many times where an old man stood up to testify and he said well I am not what I want to be I am not yet what I ought to be but I thank God that I am certainly not what I used to be and so we can easily get discouraged in the fact that we're not yet where we would desire to be and we give up but that's not what we need to focus on we need to focus on the fact hey I'm not what I used to be I've known know the grace of God I've started on a journey I fell down I've made some mistakes along the way but I get back up because he's there to lift me you know when we're so weak that we can't even pull ourselves up he's there without stretched arms I used to sing a song as a young boy his hand reached farther down than my hand could reach up from the depths of the pit I Cried unto the Lord and he heard me I want you to know he hears you in this hour may God bless you father have mercy on your people today and restore them to complete faith in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ God bless you byebye for now [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]
