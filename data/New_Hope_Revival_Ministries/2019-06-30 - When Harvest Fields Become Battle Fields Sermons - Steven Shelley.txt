TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I love the King James version of the Bible I I like the King's English it gives me something to to murder so I love it and I don't ever want anybody to think I don't and we received old last year sometime a few criticisms from precious message people because we dared quote from any other version than the King James but I don't think that that's sin I think if we're very careful and we keep lining it up with the King James and lining it up with the original I think we'll be all right is that okay so I'm gonna read my text this morning and I don't normally do that but I'm going to read a portion of my text just from the amplified version and I think I'm safe to do that because I feel like you are very familiar with this portion of Scripture in the King James but if not you can check me out and I think you'll find that this is a beautiful amplified expanded version of this text it's found in Hebrews chapter 10 verses 35 and 36 I'm going to tell you upfront that I've spent a lot of time in this message it's a very simple message but I've spent a lot of time with it because it came by inspiration a few weeks ago and I worked really hard this week to to boil it down you know it's very hard to mark through things and say I won't share that now I won't share that now it's hard you know you if you've ever prepared a sermon or a less-than you know what that's about I as a pastor in the summertime when so many people are gone and a lot of times at one time you have this tendency to say I'd better hold on to that for when everybody here because everybody needs to hear it I'll just preface what I'm going to say today by saying everybody in this ministry needs to hear this message I believe that I'm not just saying it I believe it with all my heart and may God grant them a hunger and a desire to catch it later and I need your help to get it out to make it what it needs to be this morning Hebrews chapter 10 verse 35 and 36 in the amplified bible do not therefore fling away your fearless confidence now how many of you already remember that in king james casting not away your confidence do not therefore fling away your fearless confidence for it carries a great and glorious compensation of reward how many of your resting on that for you have need of steadfast patience and endurance the King James is one of the only versions of the Bible that translates this word patience most all of the other versions use the word endurance they're very similar but not necessarily 100% identical so I like it that the amplified uses both for you have need of steadfast patience and endurance so that you may perform and fully accomplish the will of God do you believe that your purpose here I believe it's our purpose here to perform and fully accomplish the will of God and thus receive oh my listen at this and thus receive and carry away and enjoy to the fool what is promised let me read it again and thus receive and carry away and enjoy to the fool what is promised you don't want to receive it and then drop it you want to receive it and carry it with you how many of you believe that every time we come into the presence of the word we have something to carry away we do a man we receive another level or another layer or another expression of our origin of where we came from we came from the word and from the presence of the Lord the presence of the word so let's pray father we thank you this morning that you are with us we feel you and even if we didn't feel you we would reach out to try to touch you anyway because we know that you are the source of everything that we need today if we're in need of pain relief you're the great pain reliever if we need healing from infirmity or disease you're the great healer several people mention wisdom direction and understanding and even Nathan prayed a voice behind us Lord there are many of us who could use that not just to face a serious moment but but every day we could use the direction of the Lord and help from the Lord in our life and so we ask that you would provide that that we would hear you not just this morning as the word is expounded but as we take the word home with us may he continue to speak and may we continue to hear we bind every demonic power every demon of hell that opposes the release of God's perfect and true word and we ask this morning that a heaven that the heavens would be opened over this place and that you would channel to us that you would pour upon us everything we need for strength for sustenance for this week ahead now I know some my agenda my plans for the week my calendar but Lord there are many things that all of us will face this week that we've not penciled in and we're going to need your help to get through those things to make the right decision in those things and to come out smelling like you in those things we asked for that grace this morning it is in the lovely an exalted name of Yeshua our Messiah we pray amen and the church said Amen you may be seated don't forget to help me I want to preach this morning I have about 10 titles none of them are necessary but I'm starting I'm starting to title them so that when I leave them somebody will know what they are I'm taking a little time to do that and and so I guess my favorite title is when harvest fields become battle fields I believe you'll be able to relate to that this morning you might also call it fight or flight you might also call it guarding your harvest but here's what I'd like for you to remember listen carefully you're gonna want to write this down if you don't fight for your beans but devil will take your taco your burrito and your whole enchilada point 1 write it down what you hear in church this morning I heard about tacos and burritos and enchiladas if you don't fight for your beans the devil will take your taco your burrito and your whole enchilada and your Mexican casserole to sister or leader if we don't fight for what we have for what God has given us the devil will take it and he will never give it back until somebody dares to face him nose to nose and say devil give it back in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now how many of you believe he has to obey because we expose him I want you to know that devil is exposed today and we are uncovering him today and we are saying according to God's Word proverbs 631 concerning a thief and we know who the thief is the Bible said the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy every person here has an enemy and it's not so much that you are his enemy but the Word of God that is in you is his enemy he is the enemy of God therefore he is an enemy of God's Word and the Word of God that is in you must come to fruition it has to come to maturity and expression and Satan opposes that so he steals it one beam at a time until there's no burrito left he doesn't just come in and snatch the whole thing all at one time because you would catch him and he knows that if you catch him he's really in trouble well I want to tell you today we're exposing him and we're catching him in the act and we're demanding according to proverbs 631 but if he be found he shall restore Sevenfold he shall give all the substance of his house every bit of it and so I want my burrito back I want my enchilada back I want my taco back I want every one of my beans back if you feel the same way say man it's like this if you don't fight for your beans he'll take your beans and come for your corn and if you don't fight for your corn he'll come and get your okra and then he'll come for your Tomatoes and that's where we're really gonna have a fight he's not getting them Satan doesn't want you to have any part of the harvest that you have sowed toward well we say to the devil you're a liar you're a thief and you are exposed and you must take your hands off of what God has claimed as his own I want to tell you I want to share a few things with you about harvest this morning and I need to do that quickly so that I can get to where I really want to be here's a few things for you and I to remember about harvest the quality and quantity of your harvest is directly proportional to how you sow your seed and how you sow your seed determines your harvest the quality and quantity you can't so bad seed and get a good harvest right you got a sow good seed now I want to make sure you understand that we are talking about finances but we're not just talking about finances in fact finances is only a small portion of what we're talking about but I know that as soon as we talk about seed time and harvest your mind is going to go to the bank account but I want you to know my money is not all I so I so my money I can't hardly wait to get it so that I can turn loose of it I mean that I'm blessed when God blesses me I automatically look for ways that I can give it back most of the time that is through the church but it's not always through the church I'm thankful to have it so that I can give it and if God will bless me with more I want to give that away too because what I have found out is my granny was right when she used to say you cannot outgive the Lord but your money is not your only seed we sow our time we saw our debt ocation we saw our loyalty we saw our faithfulness we solu we saw so many seed and the quality quality the quality of your seed determines the quality of your harvest you can't you know I have had seed that got pushed back and didn't get planted for years and I'm always blessed when I get a good turnout but I know that I'm never getting the turnout I'm never getting the the the harvest that I would have received had I planted the seed when it was fresh the older the seed gets the less harvest you can expect there's still life in there as you heard brother random talk about seed that were was as old as the gardeners of Egypt during the time of Joseph it brings forth a harvest but it doesn't bring forth the same kind of harvest or the same quality or quantity of harvest that it would bring forth if it was planted in the right season before it gets so old have you ever opened a path say flower seed that were old and not only do you see see but you see dust in there because some of the seed of rotted some of them have dried up and they have become powder so the quality of your seed and the quantity how many seeds you plant is directly proportional to what kind of harvest you can expect I have never said that ever without feeling a little measure of resistance in the house no matter where I have said it and that is simply because again people's mind always always goes to money when you're talking about seed time and harvest but I didn't make that up I didn't add that to my notes till this morning but I didn't make that up because here's what the scripture said very very carefully 2nd Corinthians 9 and verse 6 stay with me but this I say he which soweth sparingly meagerly shall reap also sparingly so some of us can look forward to a sparse harvest because we are far too stingy with the seed that we are sowing remember we're not just talking about money come on now help me we're not just talking about money we're talking about that which you have that which you carry that is a value that's seed what God has given you what God has placed in you gift or talent or ability that's also seed for you to sow amen are you with me you are with me a minute ago when I'm talking about taking it back but now when we're talking about making sure that you're sowing properly for harvest people get a little you can just feel it but the scripture was clear if you sow sparingly reluctantly I don't ever forget the little widow because to you her offering of her giving her sowing would have been very sparse or sparingly but to her it was very bountiful because it was all she had so you're never to compare your seed or your sowing to someone else's sowing not of their life not of their time because you may be called to invest lots of time in someone and someone next to you may not have the same calling so if you don't see them doing what you do that doesn't mean you can judge them it means that everybody must sow based on what God has placed in their life that has value whether again that's money or talent or time or or gifting or whatever it is and we'll give you a minute to say man and he which soweth bountifully shall also reap also excuse me he would sow about ibly reap also bountifully so the quantity and quality the quality and the quantity of your harvest is directly proportionate to your sowing to the seed that you sow this is a very important scripture to write down and remember in this Luke chapter six and verse 38 and we just read this a week ago give give give give of all that you have that is a value if it's valuable and God has placed it in your hands give give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over remember god shakes the bag down so that more can be placed in there when it's time to dump that on your head every one of us have done that my granny used to talk to me about picking cotton she hated picking cotton most of the time the cotton came in the end of August or the 1st of September in down home where she was from but always every year on her birthday August the 8th there was enough cotton to be ready that her mother would say Mildred go and get the early cotton and she'd say mama can I do it tomorrow today is my birthday and her mama would say what a wonderful day for you to go pick the early cotton and she said I hated to but I learned that if I would just put it in and she said sometime I'd even put it in my hand and roll it around that I could fill up the bag really fast and I would take it to mama and mama would stand on the porch and shake it down and say go fill it up again and she said I would find out that I could put twice more not just a half more but twice more than what I had put in in that bag if I just shook it down that gives me a hope this morning give and it shall be given unto you good measure press down and then shaken together and running over shall men shall men that's how God works he uses others shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure here it is proportionate somebody say proportionate with the same measure that you meet with all it shall be measured to you again now remember that is based it's relevant and it's based on what God has given you that's a value maybe you are talented in certain areas and not talented in others and people keep trying to pull you into an area that you don't have a lot of value in well you're gonna be sowing sparingly in an area that you don't do very well in but slip back over here to something that God has placed in you and use that so that and there's much of that as you possibly can the truth is a lot of us in this room we don't really feel like we're good at anything well I want you to know that's a lie I don't care who you are or how insignificant you feel God is not a liar and he has placed something precious something holy something valuable in you not just his spirit but he has placed his potential he has placed a portion of his ability that's what a talent is that's what a gift is it's God giving you a part of himself that you can learn to use to sow to give and bless other people because we're living to bless the Lord and we're living to bless other people if you're with me you can say Amen not an offering message you would be delighted to know that every bill that we owe is paid God is good this isn't an offering message Church payment made Jerusalem payment made and we've got some debt but we're making payments on that where did we get that we got that from the times that we didn't have what we needed to pay but we're making payments on that but as of today we don't know anything other than you know regular payments Church payments etc but nothing is late nothing is past due and nothing will be due in fact a lot of what is due tomorrow it's been paid so I'm not preaching about money you can relax but I will tell you this if some of us could get a hold of this and apply it to our finances we would never have to take a special effort again you can't outgive the Lord now I got to I got to go on and here's how this stuff works we so we wait and we hope to reap we sow we wait eventually we reap you can't believe what it says on the seed pack it's not always accurate when they print that seed pack they print it for all zones you put that out I mean there may be a little God on there but it'll tell you a germination period and I want you to know you don't always happen just like that the girl who cuts my hair told me a month ago she was about to get a harvest and she never did get it never did get it never did get it it just it come on but it wasn't getting big enough it wasn't growing and and Friday night we were out and about and she sent me a text and showed me a picture of three cucumbers in a little old tomato and she said I'm officially a gardener she felt that harvest was going to come a month ago but but because she saw it beginning to form and beginning to grow she had no no grid she had never planted before that she killed every plant anybody'd ever given her she said so she had no grid for how long it would take that little old cucumber to get now in the right season with all the right conditions they grow overnight but in one stuff some wasn't going on just right she's getting in the swing of it she's killing her bugs she was one of them that had a trouble had trouble killing the past I said okay let him know thrive because they're not gonna thrive on the weeds they're gonna thrive on your work they are out to eat what you have planted before it comes to harvest and if you let the devil he will come after the fruit fruit is mature and he'll try to steal it then he never stops trying to steal the harvest of what you have sown for in the work of the kingdom of God he's never going to lay down and play dead he's never going to let you a prospering Arvest without a fight you're gonna have to fight and you're gonna have to hold on tight and you're gonna have to say you ain't getting my burrito because I'm not going to let you get my beans you with me some of us have sowed and prayed and waited and sowed and prayed and waited and sowed and prayed and waited and nothing comes in fact a lot of us feel like that we are very overdue for a harvest sometimes we get mighty tired of waiting but here is something very important to remember I don't know how long you're going to have to wait but I know that God doesn't lie help me just a minute I know that God doesn't lie he is not a liar neither the son of man that he would have need to repent if God promised it it will come to pass it's the promise of his word you're not taking me at my word you're taking God at His Word if he said it that settles it if you want it to work in your life you've got to believe it and attach faith to it but as soon as it came out of his mind and out of his mouth it was forever settled heaven and earth can pass away but he said my word remaineth abideth continuous forever and ever and ever so you've gotta wait some time and here is something to remember you must never abandon your seed you cannot run off and leave it to grow on its own you cannot depend on someone who loves you to take care of your seed it's yours it is very very very personal very personal I'm not going there completely but there is a scripture in the Bible that talks about the wasting of a man's seed do you know what I'm talking about very specific scripture about the wasting of a man's seed because your seed is very personal and it is very precious and your life is in that seed if you don't believe that you ask some of those criminals that they're locking up because they left some of their life they left some of their life behind and somebody went in with a DNA a sample and took that and tested it and sent it off did you know that crimes are being solved today that are 25 and 30 years old because the DNA that the technology needed and and the staff needed to do all the testing was not available and now it's more readily available and in the same manner people are getting off people are walking out of the jail that had been in there 25 and 30 years because of a mistake and I always grieve at that when I hear that it grieves me I had some time that I wanted to listen to something a little less heavy and I thought I was choosing the right thing I listened to to a man here from Alabama a black man from Alabama that served many many years I listened to his book on on my phone on audio of all those years that he served in death row and nobody heard him and nobody would listen to him and nobody would help him until finally a man over here in Montgomery who has dedicated his life to helping people like that was able to go back and prove there's no possible way what I liked about this man he's hurt he's wounded his life is forever changed but instead of being bitter he said I've got to turn this around and make what I have left of my life free to work it's gotta count for something it's got a man out for something my mother died didn't when I was in prison I think my best friend died when I was no not his best friend but a member of his best friend's family maybe a wife or child died while I was in prison I'll never be able to get that time back with them but I can take what time I have and make it count how are they able to do that sometime because there is you there is you in your seed you are represented in the seed that you sow and I'm not just talking about the male seed of sperm either I'm talking about your gift your talent your time your finance you are represented in that seed so don't you get tired of waiting and walk off and holler to somebody else tend my garden it's your seed you are represented in that seed that you sowed and you've got to stay there and watch that seed my momma momma don't depend on the preacher to guard your seed don't depend on your wife to watch over your seed or your neighbor to care for you've got to see the life the value and the investment that you made whether it is in the natural or in the spiritual and you've got to stand on guard to tell the devil you're not getting my beans because I'm gonna make me a burrito in the by-and-by I'm not the biggest Mexican fan in this room but I found that quote this week and I said and I'm gonna build around that because I know there's a lot of taco eaters in the church I don't know if you put beans in your taco but pretend like you do the enemy wants to steal if he can keep you from sowing seed he will if he can't keep you from sowing seed he'll come how many of you know he'll send birds of the air I'm gonna follow through this thing I've been sighs spent a lot of time I'm gonna I'm gonna put some investment here can't you hear him sometime ha ha ha I wished I could sound like a pigeon hmm but I can't get anybody that's pretty good that's not how they sound when they get shot but that's how they sound when they're thriving caw caw caw it's like lies it's like Satan's threats it's like the enemy's accusation always making noise caw caw caw trying to distract you and if you walk out of that field to get your rifle you better be careful because they're coming down for a harvest they're coming down to eat the seed the birds of the air will come and eat your seed if it's already sprouted and they can't eat it well you know what the enemy will do he'll send a cankerworm he'll send a palmer worm he'll send a counter pillar he'll send one of those beautiful beautiful green worms that ginger Bell found over there on Olivia's tomato plant hideous hideous somebody said they've got to have a purpose they do to teach you about how to guard your harvest overnight he'll strip every leaf off overnight he'll chew on this stem he will get the bloom there will be nothing left I want you to know I've seen them you they call out to their cousins and the next thing you know they'll eat it down to a little stem about like fat if you're not out there you got to get in there and grab it and smoosh it because the enemy is out to devour what you have sown in faith believing that God is going to give you a harvest over and I could really preach on that I could stay on that a while but I in Galatians chapter 6 verse 9 in King James and let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we don't listen to the crows if we don't run away and leave the seed we planted that do something else because we're distracted if we faint not if we don't get too tired and too weary and throw up our hands and give up if we will hold on to this promise there is a due season every seed right this put this down every seed has a due season for maturity for harvest every one you plant in the natural in the spiritual there's a gestation period there and it will come to its maturity to its fruition in the right time let me read this in another version so let's not get tired of doing what is good it is good to sow seed if God gives you something he gave it to you to bless you and he gave it to you to give to somebody else to bless them so let's not get tired of doing what is good at just the right time my timing is quite obviously not his timing I'm trying to work on that because I would like to allow my timing to line up with the timing of the Lord because that would do away with some of that Hope deferred and disappointment that comes by expecting God to move when we want him to move or when we think we need him to move when he's already got a plan come on now his plan is older than your expectation his plan to prosper you and your seed was from before the beginning of time and if you just hold on and not grow weary if you just hold on and not give up and not not not walk away from what you were planted and not faint the amplified bible says if this way well let me let me yeah just the right time we will reap a harvest a blessing if we don't give up the amplified said and let us not lose heart and grow weary and faint in acting nobly and doing right for in due time and at the read it for me at the appointed season we shall reap if we do not loosen who and relax our courage and feint it takes courage to plant a seed fear will keep you from even planting a seed it takes courage you've got to overcome fear to even put your seed in the ground because you know what can happen to it once you turn it loose the enemy will make you think you've got to hold on to it because one in the hand is better than two in the bush the enemy will make you think that you've got to hold on to it so that it's not exploited or so that it's not wasted but God is calling you to put it somewhere and believe him he-man we're talking about all across the board now don't go back don't only go back don't only go back to the checkbook but don't forget the checkbook don't you dare do it don't ever do that don't ever rule that out don't ever let the enemy intimidate you in that manner because if you do you will limit your harvest it will absolutely be limited all right let us not grow weary and faint and acting nobly and doing right for in due time and at the appointed season we shall reap if we do not loosen and relax our courage and feint the timing of your harvest is often determined by what you do while you're waiting on it to come in the timing of your harvest is often determined by what you do while you're waiting for it to come in you can't party you can't run off and abandon it you can't despise it you can't get greedy over what you've already turned loose of come on now you can't didn't I'm going there I didn't mean to stay there I don't want to go there but I'm going there for just a minute you can't get mad at the church and then say I want my time back people have done it you know what I told him long gone long gone unless you gave some last week it ain't around any longer you can't get it back we don't offer a money-back guarantee the enemy will drive you crazy about the seeds you've sown if you let him whatever seed natural seed spiritual seed he'll run you crazy and if you start despising that not only did the Bible say give and it shall be given unto you the Bible said God loves a giver who gives with a cheerful heart it's always easy to be cheerful when you're giving away all your time because we like our time it's not always easy to be cheerful when you're giving away your talent or you're giving away your profits it's hard to do sometime amen brother but we have to do it anyway and we have to remember we're always sewing we have to maintain a cheerful spirit it's not Oh Lord Mersey did I just say that did you know that is the opposite of grumpy you can't be cheerful and grumpy at the same time at the same minute to save your life so you can't we're back we're in the checkbook sorry you can't give an offering this morning and have a flat tire tomorrow and curse your seed have you ever done it I have oh if I'd have just waited another week then I would have had the money I need for that tyre let me tell you something that is not the way it works you put your seed your money your gift your time your talent whatever else you carry that's valuable your ear some people have an ear to listen that's something I'm asking God for I've heard enough in my lifetime already to do me with a lot of folks I'll be honest but I'm asking him because I know how important it is for some people to be heard so you may be like me and you may have to ask the Lord to give you an ear that is willing to hear and that's a gift and for some like me it's a sacrifice but I got to do it and I've got to do it as a seed and I've got a it in a cheerful way so that I don't curse my seed by the attitude that I develop because of something that happens along the way because I don't know how long it's going to take that seed to come to maturity and give me a reward I'm gonna have to keep a cheerful spirit about that for a long time maybe you may be anxious to get out of here but the Lord wants you to hear this he wouldn't have given me I'm telling you he would not let me get away from this and even all day yesterday when I said but Lord there's so many who are gone that need to hear this and the Lord reminded me about you and I almost put on face book if you're not out of town please come to church I've got something that I feel like the Lord wants to say to you and you say well I haven't heard him yet keep listening you may get an ear to hear before we leave here in a little while the timing of your harvest is often determined about what you do while you're waiting for it so keep the right spirit how many of you have ever had to say Lord I gave that unto you I gave that unto you I didn't give that to them I gave that unto you I'm not looking to them to give me my harvest I'm looking to you when I gave that my seed might have been used my seed might have been abused my seed might have been stolen away but when I gave my seed I was giving it to you come on it's Kingdom business I invested it with a cheerful heart and I know that you knew that and know that and I'm waiting on my harvest how many of you believe you've still got a harvest coming you can't many of some of you can't accept it because you don't want God in your money see how quiet it'll get you don't want God in your money you want to do what you want to do and what you feel like you should do or can't do or can do and you don't want God to get involved but I want you to know sometimes God will get involved and stretch you I know you a lot of you a lot of you people know that he will stretch you beyond your mental capacity to wrap your head around it because he's got a plan he's got a plan and he doesn't want to bless you sparingly so he don't want you sowing sparingly or I think we'll move on if the timing of your harvest is often determined by what you do while you're waiting for it look at what Psalm 67 verse 5 and 6 says let the people praise thanks sister Bonnie let the people praise the old God let all the people praise thee then I want you to say then that's the next verse oh this isn't I'm sorry oh good all right thank you thank you so much let the people praise the old God let all the people praise thee then shall the earth yield her increase say then when when is then let the people praise thee O God let the people praise thee O God then shall the earth yield her increase and God even our own God shall bless us I want to read it all again go back to the verse before let's read every bit of that again let the people praise the old God let all the people praise thee then shall the earth yield her increase then when when the people praise thee did you know that you're praised what'd you do what'd you do while you're waiting on your harvest helps to determine the timing of your harvest this verse almost bowled me out of the chair when I read that the earth is responding to rain on my seed and the earth has to turn loose of my seed when the rain falls on the earth the earth when praise is light rain when I praise the Lord it's light rain on my seed it's like oil anointing on my seed then shall the earth yield her increase and God even our own God shall bless us you want to know what to do while you're waiting on your harvest come on now why don't you practice it right now and say Lord I praise you because you are wonderful you are wonderful Lord I want you to rain on my seed I want you to rain on it remember don't despise it and if you have repent just go back to God Lord I let the enemy affect my emotion I cursed my seed with my own mouth I said I wished I had it back I wished I hadn't given it I wish that I would have done this I wish that I would have done that but Lord I repent right now I wouldn't give him that under men I was giving that unto you I repent of that cursing of my seed right now and I ask you Lord to give me grace to praise you while I wait how many of you have ever praised the Lord as though it was and though you had it in your hand you were praying for something and and praise that you felt anointing on your praise and you just started praising in advance and you just started worshipping God like you was already eating Tomatoes off this is a real important key the earth shall yield her increase and God shall bless us if we are faithful to praise the Lord in the beans in the bean field praise him over your seed if you're still with me say Amen it's 1243 I have time we didn't drag anybody here last night but we're here today we may not have any more Saturday night services for a while because I don't want to drag anybody here but don't Sunday I'm gonna let the Lord have his way you might as well determine to do the same you might as well determine they get a little praise going on in your field because some of you are hungry you're deprived and you don't realize it you're not eating as high on the hog excuse excuse the expression cuz that's not kosher eating you're not eating us how on the hog as you can and it may not be this you're not sowing seed you may be sowing seed and still not eating high on the hog it may be because of what you're doing while you're waiting on the seed I want you to know this what the Lord said and it's so very powerful and so very true there is life and there's something else in your mouth there is life and death you are a part you are a manifestation of a word that originated in God and was spoken into existence so word and spoken word is very much a part of your identity you could even say that it's a very big part of your spiritual DNA and therefore words are very important in your life what you say is very very important this is not this is not you know just the power of positive thinking and and and and you name it and claim it word of faith and blab it and grab it and whatever else it's not at all it's just a fixed law because you are a part of a word that was spoken you are an expression of a word that was spoken words are very important in your life and what comes out of your mouth is an overflow it is an abundance of what's already in your heart so if you don't want people to see what's in your heart keep your mouth shut because if you keep talking everybody's gonna know what you carry in your heart I want you to remember this every problem is a heart problem because your heart is directly connected to your soul and your soul is the seat of your mind your will and your emotions every problem that I have every problem that you have is a heart problem and that is one of the reasons why we must guard the garden because your inner life is a garden you are a garden on the inside it's interesting what God told Adam he said be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth interesting I read it this week from the book of Genesis I almost started with it this morning and then I thought if I announced my Texas Genesis everybody in the room will groan because they think it'll take all day to get to Revelation if we start in Genesis and so I didn't do it but I'll throw it in here now God said to Adam beef and Eve be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth he didn't just say fill the garden he said fill the earth Adam and Eve had a responsibility that was bigger than the garden interesting isn't it so don't you doubt for one minute that God didn't know they were gonna have to get out of the garden to fulfill what he called him to do in the beginning God told him to fill the earth to fill the earth they had to get out there God knew from the beginning they weren't gonna stay in the garden the garden represented something that's so much bigger and so much spiritual more spiritual than a geographical location the garden represented what God wants to do in us he wants to cultivate his word in us you are not only one who sow seed you are one who has received seed and there is seed laying in you that the enemy does not want to come to harvest maturity there is seed that you carry from God some of you came here with representation from your father with the deposit of that zowie life in you before you were ever born and before you were ever born again and that seed was added to on your mother's knee or in a Sunday School class our grandfather in the woods talking to you about the things of God or whatever a Bible story sitting in a doctor's office because every doctor's office used to have the picture Bible I don't know where you got it but you got it and then you came under the influence of a word that was sent from God a message that was sent from God I heard brother Branham say this week the purpose of this message is to prepare and perfect the bride simple he didn't send this word to form another denomination or to exclude somebody else he sent it to make sure his bride reaches her perfection and her completion and there's enough of the Word of God in you remember how the Prophet said everything you need to make the Raptors we're not on your bookshelf not on your smartphone not on your mp3 player or the cassette tape our own the app and by the way we now have all of the sermons of brother Branham on the new hope app from 1962 all the way through to 1965 so nobody has to change apps to get anything by the Branham said from 1960 to 1965 is that right brother RJ so just visit it it's there we've had almost 700 people download the app I think we've had almost 8000 openings of that app and playing of some form of media and it goes on and on it's just the beginning one day I was rejoicing I said Oh Lord Thank You 600 and then the enemy said you know how many people there are in the world and you know what I told the enemy I may not be called to help every one of them but I sure do want to help the ones I've been called to help and you know what he did he shut up he shut up I was praying in the office one day this week know the end of last week and I was praying in the office about something doesn't matter what I was praying about but I heard the Lord speak oh yes he speaks I heard him speak right in here and he said don't ever forget other sheep I have that are not of this fold I got other people out there that I can get their ear I can speak to them and that's why when the check came in the mail this week I could rejoice because the Lord confirmed his word I'll tell you about that later because the Lord confirmed his word listen God can speak to anybody that will give him half a chance and listen come on now he knows how he knows how we hear this all the time that God knows how there is a transfer of wealth and blessing there has to be for the harvest there has to be for the final one the last one to hear what they need to hear God has to finance the harvest it's up to him to do it we put our trust in him we saw our see we don't despise the seed we sow we water them with praise we weed them we weed out those thoughts that the enemy sins to try to choke out the seed so that we don't get a harvest come on now and and if the enemy approaches we pick up anything and everything we can get our hands on that looks like a weapon it might be a jawbone of an ass it might be a it might be an ox code we pick up whatever we can get ahold of and we say to the enemy I know what you're counting on me to do you're counting on me to fly you're counting on me to flee because I have run from you you dirty dog in the past whoa but I'm here to tell you devil tell him I'm not running this time I'm not running this time I'd rather die on my principles I'd rather die guarding my harvest if I run from the enemy I know what he's gonna do he's gonna shoot me in the back how many of you know you can't trust the devil how many of you know you can't trust the enemy you haven't been here too long yet hold on you can't trust the devil you run from him he'll shoot you in the back what a coward he'll kill you he'll shoot you in the back of the head he'll sneak up on you and you won't even know what happened the only way if you've got two back if you've got to get away you better back away but I challenge you not to abandon your seed hallelujah you know what I wished I was there I wished I was down there listening to this I promise you I could do a better job supporting the preacher than some of you can do I've promised you I would because I really believe that it is imperative and vital for some to get militant we have no problem fighting with one another biting and devouring one another what we need to do is stand together united against a common devil and tell him i'm not going to abandon my seed hallelujah i'm on a garden the harvest okay got a hurry got to go wow wow wow wow wow thank you so much that was our number one here's our number two we all know that King David was a great leader Amen he combined in himself the qualities of bravery and compassion and integrity that made other men rally to his cause the Bible tells us that within his army of soldiers there were 30-plus warriors who might in today's terms be called special forces how many of you know David had Special Forces the Bible calls them what you remember david's mighty men a small militia of extraordinary skilled war warriors these men were the best of the best the strongest of the strong the bravest of the brave the ones who would not flinch under fire the men on whom you could depend if you were surrounded by the enemy to put it in another context or some of you that might be more familiar with this you could take all of the modern heroes and put their qualities together and you would find the kind of power the kind of strength the kind of courage that was in david's mighty men you could take rambo bruce lee the terminator i know these are older ones i'm more for me he's coming see us and finally chuck norris I know more about the older ones and I do the newer ones you put all the fightin power and strength courage that those men displayed fictitiously and you place that in david's mighty men because everything you think chuck norris is david's mighty men really were yes sir so much so that out of the 30 plus and I say that because their name two places and the lists are not exactly the same and some people believe that some of them appear in both lists with a different name I'm not I tried to go down that road and I saw that was gonna take me on a on a theological something that I wasn't interested in right now maybe I'll search that out another time but there's a lot of debate about this so I just went back and added a plus to my to my notes 30 plus out of that 30 plus above that 30 plus there were three that are mentioned in the in second Samuel in a list of David's mighty men as his bodyguards and of the 30 plus these three were mentioned as rising above and going beyond the rest but their exploits and the testimonies of their service is something that souls have been sung about and sermons have been preached about David's mighty men and if you will turn this morning in the time that we are taking turn to 2nd Samuel chapter 23 verse 11 and 12 and this is where I want to begin you mean what was the first hour that was getting us to this place and after him was Shama the son of a G the horite and the Philistines were gathered together into a troop where was a piece of ground full of lentils and the people fled from the Philistines who do you think that was the people that was David's allies that was his fellow comrades Seamus comrades not David's Seamus the people fled from the Philistines but he stood in the midst of the ground this is 2nd Samuel 23 I believe verse 11 and 12 do I have that wrong I could you read along all right good but he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it next verse and slew the Philistines he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and slew the Philistines and the Lord wrought a great victory how many of you know what I'm talking about did you know brother Branham never preached on Shama all the thousands of sermons he preached that we have our own record there are hundreds and hundreds that we don't have on tape he preached on another one of the mighty men Shankar and there are many people who believe that this is the same man Shama and Shem gar and that you have to take both both tellings to get the whole story but I'm not going to make that assumption this morning I'm going to take it just like it it reads here I want to go over this with you for just a moment and I know you're some of you're tired and I know some of you have lost interest already but I've come to give you something that could have impact your life amen and I know that that our attention deficit disorder from cell phone addiction is kicking in this morning and maybe the horns are already growing on the base of your your neck and your spine there because you've now read the medical report where they're finding that children and young people are coming in and they're they're having knobs forming a bone on the base of their skull horns say look like one doctor called them horns and they're forming there because people are spending so much time like this and it's so unhealthy for the body in fact they have said I read another article this week that said that it will not be like the hunchbacks that we used to see from time to time but it will be as bad and more common 20 years from now we know if Jesus terry's they're not saying anything about that it will be more common to see people in their 30s and 40s beginning to snoop over all of that directly related to how much time they spend on their phone with their head crunched over like that interesting isn't it you've got to use your phone I understand but you better learn to hold your head straight and then I'll know if you're using it in church if you hold it up high like that you you know I don't I don't particularly like this thought because I depend on mine a lot and it's easy to get a little offended but I want to tell you something it is definitely affecting the way we pay attention I feel sorry for teachers I feel sorry for teachers in the schools and even home school who have to try to capture the attention of their children in a hurry cuz their mind is constantly scrolling to the next thought it's interesting isn't it I know some of you are struggling with that this morning but the Lord must have known all of that when he was pouring into me so here we go I don't know how big the field was that Shama stood in but what I know is the Bible said it was loaded with lentils it was full of lentils lentils or legumes small bean or pea like balls that grow in a pod and they're flat usually in the Bible of a reddish-brown color even though a lot of times what we get are darker gray or black now in the Bible they were a very important staple food in both the Middle East and the Near East these littles were needed to provide food for the children of Israel who were living in that area in English Lehi littles could were amazing because they could be eaten fresh which I don't know anything about never had them that way or they could be dried this is how we're more familiar with lentils today and preserved so that you could eat all the way through when there was nothing to harvest so I'm not excited about lentils I'll be honest they're just not all that exciting to me and and they work on you I'm going to tell you that right now I'm not trying to be common but they work on you like pintos and all the rest of them somebody scrab me another water pretty pretty pretty please whoever can and will I knew when I come out here this was going to be a - water sermon so they were important because they could last way on into the season when nothing was growing I want you to notice how strategic the devil is how strategic the enemy is the Philistines waited until the field was full of lentils they did not attack thank you so much they did not attack when the Israelites were plowing the field and breaking up the ground they did not attack when the Israelites had their sack of seed and we're walking through the field sowing seed they did not attack when they were hoeing out the weeds are caring for the crop but they waited until the field was full of lentils it was harvest time and there were probably harvesters in the field these were not soldiers as we might suppose they were farmers and they were doing what anybody does when they plant a crop and it comes in they they know they've got to get it in it's important not to waste the work the labor and the effort that goes in to planning a field like that the Bible said the Philistines banded together they gathered together in a troop in King James in Hebrew that's exactly what it reads it's it reads as a military troop and what that means is in fact another Bible translation says they mustered for battle what that says to us is that the Philistines assembled their army and they were prepared this wasn't a casual attack it wasn't a spontaneous attack it was a well kakhiel calculated strategic attack on this little field they were ready they inventoried their equipment they assessed their readiness for the upcoming fight they came in out of the hill country in attack mode well-prepared the word Philistines means immigrants it means those who wander in and out of a country isn't that it's interesting in light of the Palestinians who are named after the Philistines who are not not fighting for their homeland it never was their homeland they have always wondered in and out they followed the crops they followed prosperity they looked for opportunity to bless themselves with the labor of someone else in the Bible days there were thieves it kind of explains to us today why when Israel withdrew from the Gaza they went in and destroyed the carrot farms farms that were were acclaimed all over the world because they were growing the most amazing sweet carrots that were being exported all over Europe and even into Russia and people loved those carrots and they were there the Israelite the Jews when they left the Israelis when they left they didn't destroy the fields they left everything just like it was and withdrew when the Palestinians went in they burned the greenhouses they destroyed the fields they tore down the farms does that make any sense to you at all it speaks of people who come in and out or take advantage and and and and truly are not really using a lot of wisdom it's about hatred it's about destruction it's not about being smart for your people you don't have to say man it's just too obvious isn't it First Samuel chapter 23 we just read second Samuel 23 First Samuel 23 tells us that this was a strategy that the Philistines operated in multiple times then they told David verse 1 saying behold the Philistines fight against Kela and they robbed the threshing floors look at what kind of a spirit was on the enemy they didn't come to the field every time and try to take the harvest while it was being harvested look folk they didn't want to work they didn't want to reap the harvest they didn't want to come in and run they wanted to wait here until it was already at the threshing floor we don't want to pick it we don't want to tote it we don't want to win to it we don't want to break it and beat it we just want to wait till it's on the threshing floor and come in and steal it now in that like the devil he's not just after what's growing in your field if he could he would steal what you've already harvested you better hear this if the enemy is allowed to he will steal what you've already given birth to he'll he won't wait he'll come he doesn't matter to him the his objective is to keep you from having what you sold and labored for enjoying the benefit he'll come for your children that's part of your seat he'll come he absolutely will and so today we're facing the same kind of enemy that these Philistines were our enemy is strategic he is well prepared he wants your harvest I wish you could help me he wants your harvest he wants the fruit of your labor he watched you prepare the field he watched you sow the seed he watched you hoe and pull the weed he watched your tender plants beginning to grow and now he wants to move in as you begin to see the fruit of your labor he's carefully timing his attack so that when some of our efforts begin to mature when we start moving forward in some areas of our life and seeing some progress and enjoying a little bit of the blessing of the Lord here comes that dirty devil wanting to steal the harvest that you're already holding in your hand he's a liar he's a liar and the father of all eyes John 10:10 the thief comes only to steal and to kill and destroy Jesus talking I came that they might have life and have it more abundantly verse 11 tells us in second Samuel 23 and the people fled from the Philistines it's obvious from this passage that the far majority of the people of Israel were allowing fear to control them and they had given in and they were carrying a defeated frame of mind you know it's it's just hardly fair to fight against an enemy that's already give up if you've already given up it seems unfair for the enemy to fight against you but if you have any idea that the devil is fair you don't know him like I know him he's not fair he don't care if you've given up he doesn't care if you're discouraged he helped you get there he doesn't care if you've cursed your seed if you've carried an attitude that has affected your harvest he didn't care he wants what you've got he wants what's coming to you he is the original kleptomaniac it will do him no good he steals for the joy of watching you do it out the devil is out for your joy what's he gonna do your joy nothing he just doesn't want you to have it come on he wants your milk money he's not gonna buy milk with your milk money he just don't want you to have no milk boy that ought to make you stirred come on now so you look around one day and you see the enemy coming over the hill and this is not new to you because you know this is the strategy of the Philistines you're just wondering why they're coming now and not wait until you get all the harvests then and you look around and you start talking to your buddies hey guys look what's happening they're coming in all around us they're ready to not only take us out they're ready to steal the harvest what are we gonna do you look around to see if you can get somebody to stand with you and guess what you find out there already gone there's no feet but there's plenty of sandals they've run right out of them nobody is going to help you Britta and listen now that we have no idea that that was Seamus field we don't know if one man had a feel we don't know how big the feel us we don't know how many were there we don't know how many farmers were there and how many soldiers were there we know very little about this story really if you look at it far less about this than many of the Bible stories that are not stories they're real true happenings I believe them to be we have no reason to believe that Sheva was any more emotionally attached to these beans than anybody else was I want you to know he wasn't fighting over beans for Shama this was a whole lot bigger than beans I can get me some more beans but if I do if I if I let the devil steal these beans he'll come back for my tacos he'll come back for my burrito he'll come back for the whole enchilada here it you cannot let the enemy take anything that belongs to you and if he already has tell him you caught him I caught you I recognize that you have stolen from my life and I command you I demand you to give it back you have touched my health when the scripture said I don't have to be sick I'm old but I don't have to be sick and old I'm gonna die but I don't have to die sick tell the devil you just don't want me to hold any grains any sheaves any fruit of harvest for the seed that I've sown you want me not only to be bankrupt but you want me to feel bankrupt you want me to think bankrupt you want to intimidate me from sowing any more seed Wow because look what happened to the seed you sowed the devil ate ate tacos with it so why would you keep sowing come on now I don't want to give the devil any credit I don't want to build him up I don't want to exalt him in any way but neither do I want anybody to be ignorant of his devices he is a sly old Fox come on now he is very calculated and very strategic and and he doesn't do anything spontaneously he has already plotted his course he knows exactly how to shut you up and shut you down he will bankrupt your thoughts before he goes after your bank account because if you quit sowing of yourself and from yourself you have no future hope of harvest if you can't war over the seed you've already planted you'll stop planting eventually it'll mean nothing to you being faithful to God's house will mean nothing to you being faithful in your giving will mean nothing to you having a right attitude and a right spirit when you come will mean nothing to you because the enemy has shut down with his with his crows he has shut down your your ability to see above and beyond your present circumstances I want you to know that a man who cannot see beyond today with hope and promise for the future is already dead he's a dead man walking he has no purpose for living if a man is convinced that he no longer has a seed to sow he has no reason to go on so you've got to take that back you've got to tell the devil he's a liar you've got to tell him God would leave you here one hour beyond your appointed time on this earth and if you're still kicking and breathing and moving and groaning you've still got a seed to sow you still have value to release but the devil but the devil but the devil but the Felicity I know those I know how he works he's after every one of us but he's a liar and you cannot do what everybody else does and expect to get different results if you do what everybody else does you're gonna get what everybody else gets it's like if you always do what you've always done you'll always be what you always been you know how we do reasoning in our mind but look at sister so-and-so mm-hmm well look at brother so-and-so that's part of our problem right there you better quit looking at all of them because if you are expecting somebody else to help you guard your seed in Satan's Eden you may be extremely disappointed because you may value what's underneath the ground what you've planted what you've invested but there may be nobody else who values it the way you value and you cannot expect I have had to come to that conclusion if God gives you somebody to fight with you for your harvest you better shout all over this church you better tell Ian and Milly and everybody else get out of my way I'm gonna run come on the hell I am so thankful I'm so thankful that God has been so good to give me some buddies who are willing to help me fight for my seed but I could look around tomorrow and half of them be gone or all of them be gone I can't fight because they fight I gotta fight because I have an investment that seed cost me something I said yes and because I said yes I've got to fight for the harvest that's attached to my ass we may feel alone sometime we may be alone sometime but a lot of the times we've got somebody fighting with us on our on their knees and I know we need to feel them I know we need gods with skin on them I understand that absolutely completely but I want you to know you can't count on that and if you feel completely forsaken don't forsake your seed break the cycle they all left him Hey the people fled his ally sleds Shama chose to fight while others chose to flee it seems that most of the Israelites didn't like the idea of fighting the Philistines in the middle of a bean field they favored this just just to remember try not to call them cowards they were once friends try not to call them cowards I like to look at it this way they they uh they favored making a strategic withdrawal to a different location if you examine the field I did I examined the field and I decided that in many ways they were smarter to do what they did then Shamu was to do what he did but what a smarts have to do with it anyway intellect will bring you into direct conflict with the mind of God you got to be willing to lay that down these guys were smarter maybe than shama they said it is not smart to fight an army in a bean field they are on the mountains they have a greater advantage we are standing in a large field no cover no place to hide with bean vines knee-deep if you need to slip out god bless you thank you for coming I understand do you know what happens in a field full of vines you jump up and you start moving and your dragon bean vines you be in a wrapped-up tied up tingled up mess in a hurry whenever you stand up out of the field the enemy sees you you're an instant target there's nowhere to hide in the bean vine field the enemy can attack from all sides at once in whatever numbers he can muster so it's easy to find yourself surrounded by people who would rather kill you than to say hello no wonder they ran no wonder they were it was a bean patch it wasn't a good place for a battlefield but what will you do when your harvest field becomes a battlefield will you fly or will you fight it's a question that you and I have to answer for ourselves even though we may be compelled to know what is right it's a lifelong commitment it's a decision that will cost you and shamah counted the cost he laid down his own Smart's he said it may not be smart but I got to do it even even some Christians may suggest that the bean patches that were fighting for their bigger hills to down but Shama was tired of watching his part of the harvest stolen away before it could bless and sustain his family wait just a minute I got a family in Israel that has to eat and they love burritos we have a corn patch over there and we can make us some corn bread but we really like burritos and I love my family and I'm tired of the devil stealing their burritos I don't eat a lot of burritos myself but I like them when I do but my family likes them and I'm sick of the devil coming for my burritos and I know the burrito doesn't start out at the ED Taco Bell thank God the burrito starts out in the bean field so I go to go and fight in the parking lot of Taco Bell I got a fight where it all starts I got a fight where my seed went into the ground oh my and that's why I'm standing here Shama was tired of watching the part his part of the harvest stolen away before it could bless and sustain his family defending the bean patch might have seen rather insignificant to own lookers or to others who didn't value the fields but the Bible said in verse 12 he stood in the midst of the plot he stood there but from the middle of the field Shama had a different perspective he had a bean patch perspective he looked around in those beans never looked so valuable as they did that day it was like gold to him that day because it was more than about the beans it was about his family it was about sustaining his people it was about taking the promise of the promised land it was about claiming everything that God had promised it was about shutting down the enemy - Shama it wasn't just a fight in a bean field it was a fight over a bean patch if you're a believer you need to understand right now as weary as you are you need to understand right now there is a turf war that's going on there are some green fat juicy worms getting ready to march against your field there is a turf war going on it is all around us if you had an opportunity to see any of the of the events of this week you saw ten juicy green worms standing on a platform desiring look to devour your burrito it's true it is true how many of you would support in your health care plan how many of you would support healthcare for illegal aliens ever hand went up think about it think about it you're not here legally there's a legal way to get here but since you got by with it let me take care of you in the hospital there are citizens who can't afford to go but let us make sure that we're humanitarian do you see how the enemy knows how to twist everything to play on the sympathy and you see where where one of them where where where Pocahontas did you see where she chose to celebrate her birthday with the directors of Planned Parenthood can you expect her to stand for life of course not she's a green worm in the field Oh ready to eat your harvest won't tell you something you got a bigger enemy than that to deal with she don't know you exist those people on that platform they don't know you exist but there is an enemy that knows your name he knows your address he knows every seed you've sown he knows your hope he knows your expectation he knows your and his guns are turned on you his guns are turned on me he wants my burrito it's the truth I got a hurry first time I think I've said it I'm gonna page 7 of 14 so I will stop at some point this was very personal to Shama this has got to be very personal to you if you were the only one the devil was after you got to face it like you're the only target your family is the only one the devil hates come on now you've got to get that kind of a mindset he's after me he's after my children he's after my family he's after every seed that I've ever sewn into the kingdom of God if nobody else will stand with me in my bean patch I have a responsibility I would rather die I would rather die where I planted my seed I would rather die invested my value I would rather die where I sowed for the kingdom than to run from the devil and be shot in the rear no retreat no retirement in the army of the Lord you think you're miserable now you just wait you just wait till he starts picking them off one by one you just wait till he starts moving among the things that you value and treasure the most you'll fight you'll fight like a wild man you'll fight like a wild woman then I pray you don't wait too late come on now it's time to get a warrior spirit sometimes it's not about whether or not you can kill the enemy it's about whether you can stand against the enemy and not let him have what God has given to you you may not stop him from his ambition just yet but you can strip him of his power and authority in your bean patch not mine come on now all right Satan wants to steal from the bride's territory he wants to steal from her jurisdiction and her Dominion he wants to usurp her authority to sidetrack you from your destiny Satan wants to cut you off from your source of nourishment he wants you to spiritually wither in the field he desires to weaken you so that he can simply walk off with your inheritance and with your harvest neshama it was personal something had to be done he had a cause although he did not exactly have everything going for him he was not necessarily a likely candidate for this battle let me quickly tell you why Shamas father was named aji while there is no clear consensus on the meaning of his name the International Standard Bible encyclopedia says that a G means fugitive one who flees standing firm for a cause was not a part of Shamas DNA his daddy was a runner his daddy was one who fleed as a fugitive so Sherma wasn't getting it from his bloodline he was getting it from his faith come on now guess what his name means waste desolation astonishment the most respected Hebrew dictionary in the world says that the name Shama means a horror I know what a horror movie is or a horror story I've never thought about a man being a horror somehow it doesn't feel Noble it doesn't feel holy so his daddy is a fugitive like brother branham's running from the law he had a lot stacked against him didn't he but he surrendered too call you and I have to do the same thing show him his own name why would his mama give him a name that meant a horror must have been a rough labor in delivery mama what do you want to call it a horror I know I'll grow to living but right now get him out of my face then the Bible says that he was a high right that word in Hebrew means hill in Hebrew Herrara D is the plural of a noun that means a mountain dweller likely from the hill country of Judea you know what that means it means that in his community because he was from the heights because he was from the mountains he would have been considered a bumpkin a hillbilly so Shamas daddy was a fugitive running from the law his mother called him a horror and his whole entire clan were known as hillbillies and mountain bumpkins and yet all of his friends who came with beautiful pedigrees beautiful family Linnet ran ran like little girls ran retreated to a more convenient place but the battle wasn't going to be in the woods because that day God was jealous over the bean patch tomorrow he might be jealous over the woods but this day God wanted somebody that would stand how do you know that God cared we're going in a little bit how do you know that God care you Saturday night service to look better do you maybe before we're done with this one but that's not my purpose that's not what I'm trying to do I promise you that God had a plan how do we know that God cared nobody else cared except Shama nobody else valued by being filled but Shama how do we know God cared cause the Bible tells us that God cared Schama can sit I'll read getting less trouble and get through faster he considered his options and their consequences and then Shama decided to stand stand stand stand one question what's the hardest part of winning a battle like that having the courage to take your stand in the middle of a field when you feel like a sitting duck when you know the enemy doesn't even have to strain to see where to shoot his arrow because you're just out in the middle of a field standing there like a Morning Glory how did he stand how did he find courage to stand how did he master what was necessary to stand when everybody left him alone the answer is having the courage to take your stand in the middle of a field if you can do that the rest is easy the hard part of this battle was not running away the hard part of this battle is not running away uh-huh shake your neighbor wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up you got all evening to sleep you should have drank another cup of coffee before you came you need stronger coffee to get you through boring sermons come on you can drink enough to stay awake help me now but thank you that's so sweet I'm concerned about all the rest of you I'm not just preaching for one or two I'm not just preaching for older folks I'm preaching at younger folks too I'm preaching to everybody who will hear I'm preaching to those on the stream I'm preaching to every person that the enemy is trying to slowly push you one nudge at a time out of your inheritance you know when God put this in my heart I was sitting there with brother Steve curry on my mind and I got up there on a Tuesday night and I talked about inheritance I talked about how Satan wants to I talked about the snake that was killed up there on the highway and I talked about that green worm that I didn't even know I'm gonna start calling him olive worms all I've ever seen it eat was a tomato it blew my mind when I got out of the vehicle and saw it on my olive tree that brother curry gave me oh you just make look I don't have to explain myself you ought to know you usually most of you believe for the lord long enough to know God speaks to you he'll speak through your dog if you listen he'll talk to you through leaky pipe God will use every circumstance to talk to you if you listen saw that big old fat juicy worm on my olive tree that I've already fought to keep alive and on my 50th birthday which means something to me [Music] that's when this was birthed in my heart I have an inheritance you have an inheritance my kids like burritos I don't even know if they do or not I'm just preaching he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it how did he do it Psalm 92 13 those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish flourish in the courts of our God I'll give it to you against you can put it up let the people read it Psalm 92 13 those that we planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God you better plant yourself you better plant your feet in the house of the Lord and I'm not just talking about church I'm talking about in the habitation of our God but I'm gonna tell you that everything about the bride's life is of a paradox it is all of a spiritual type and I do believe I do believe and you're not going to move me from this belief I do believe that you are no more faithful to God then you are to God's house and I not only have scriptures for it I have over 300 quotes where brother Branham is telling the people there is something wrong with you if you don't find yourself in the house of God you said well that was at the Tabernacle oh no he was out preaching on the field he was encouraging people to go to their church whether it was denominational or whatever it was you just got to get somewhere he said to brother and sister West waiting nearly 10 years on a child when you have children get them in a good Sunday school somewhere get them under some good influence some good training but it's bigger than being attached to a church it's about being attached to the habitation of God play it to your feet Shama planted his feet in the house of the Lord oh my you're not gonna move me my faith refuses to move I'm going to have my bean patch instead of you and I running from the enemy the Bible tells us submit yourselves therefore under God in James 4 and 7 resist the devil and he'll flee from you resist doesn't mean to run resist means to stand against to oppose to withstand I'm moving on the Bible said he defended it the Hebrew verb used here for defend it's spelled in a tzs Al and it means to save to rescue or to deliver actually the first line definition in most lexicons is to snatch away he defended the field he was snatching away the beans they're my beans I laughed when I read it like that I could just seem you're not getting my beans he's holding them in his hand just a few minutes before they've been harvesting littles and now he's ready he's alone he's planted his feet he's standing snatching his beans away from the enemy slip out if you need to go ahead I understand Shama boldly removed the field from the grasp of the Philistines in not getting it Jude tells us we must earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints we've got something worth fighting for how many of you believe the faith of the Apostles is worth fighting for how many of you believe Apostolic Faith is worth fighting for how many of you believe the pure faith of the saints is worth fighting for it's worth preserving how many of you believe holiness it's worth fighting for in a world like we're living in today with all those green worms out there who wanna eat o everything that we love in value and treasure come on now it's not just about Democrats it's about a lot of stuff but devil is after us but he can't win because we've planted our feet in the promises of God I don't know where to I don't know where to stop him I just have to stop I don't know how and to be continued for for those of you who beer to hear the rest but let me just get get a little more cuz this is pretty interesting to me we have something in someone we're fighting for you're not just fighting for some thing a pot of beans a burrito you're fighting for the King of Kings the Lord of lords the God of the whole the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof you're fighting for the kingdom of God when you stand to watch over your seed because you didn't sow them to a church you didn't sow them into a ministry you sowed your life into the kingdom of God you did what you did because you loved the Lord you are serving mand you are serving him come on it's bigger than the beans it's bigger than the beans feet bigger than an election how many of you know it's true we have something to fight for and someone to fight for verse 12 said and he struck down the Philistines slew is the word that's used in the original and it's spelled na ha and it means just what it says to strike or smite or beat or hit until dead you said the Bible didn't say kill the Philistines it said he struck him down oh he struck him down alright now if Shama and Shamgar are the same he did it with an ox goad but we don't know that they're the same the Bible doesn't tell us that and the Bible doesn't tell us the weapon that Shama used I read in commentaries where people have told that it was a sword because they assumed that the only way he could have won such an ultimate battle by himself was with a sword didn't they read the other stories didn't they read what can be accomplished with a jawbone of a donkey and and a hand of a man of God didn't they hear what can happen with an ox code brother Ben have said do you know what ox code is he said it's a long pole with a little sharp metal hook on the end of it and he said it's for two things it's to knock the mud off the plow and the poke for oxen the shoulder when you want him to move it ain't much it's not a sword it's not a machine gun it's something to prod the ox or to knock the Madhava plough I don't know if it was a sword the Bible doesn't say it was a sword yeah it could have been a hoe it could have been a bag of beans I know he had that in his hand wouldn't you like to think that a man stood in a field because of a heart of dedication and faith and and anyone run and that God gave him virtue and power and strength to knock down every Philistine with a bag of beans I hope I don't sound disrespectful I don't care if it was with an ox ox goad I don't care if it was with a sword it doesn't matter to me if it was with the tow sack of beans all I know is Shama stood and Shama struck down the Philistines until they were dead let me give you one more thing we're getting ready to go this word here is a time sense word in the text it is framed by a verb that would be labeled as imperfect tense this does not mean there's anything wrong with the verb but an imperfect tense of a verb in Hebrew means it is incomplete now that doesn't mean that it wasn't perfect the verb and it doesn't mean that the job wasn't completed but when an imperfect verb tense is used in Hebrew it means there was some time involved it wasn't a split second Schama didn't raise his hand his sword his beanbag and all the Philistines fall dead in the field it was a sweaty mess whoo it took some time it took some energy it took some sweat but glory be to God it was worth the effort praise the Lord it took a while but it worked I'm gonna close I'll come back to this but I want to I want to just give you this that won't be here Tuesday night or next Sunday or whatever the last part of verse 12 I'm closing I should have known and the Lord oh Jesus it's two o'clock and the Lord brought a great victory huh the Lord oh god I don't want to fight I don't want to fight for a pile of beans just for the glory of protecting the beans I want to fight in such a way that I have cooperated with your purpose and plan for those beans those beans were predestinated they were chosen beans they were going to make somebody a pie Shamas wife was going to have a bean pie Shamas children we're gonna have burritos for dinner come on and God was jealous it's bigger than the beans but don't you ever think that God does not care about the least of what you care about we're going because he does I do not have the affection for animals that some of you have but I know that God does I I know that he looks at them in a different way than I look at them I mean I think they're precious I love to see pictures of sweet animals I love to see videos I don't watch them any cat videos you understand why but I love to see I love to see video I saw a video this week of a little baby moose I think I think me Cesare I think they're so ugly they're cute and I watched a little clip I saw a little clip this weak little baby beavers in the in the hutch or whatever you call it and and who'd have ever thought a baby beaver I must be getting old who would have ever thought a baby beaver was cute they were so cute but I liked them on pictures and in videos then you don't have to feed them and take care of them but God cares about them and even if God didn't care about him because he created them he would care about them because you care about them see if I like Chinese food God cares about that he cares about everything that I care about that's how much he loves me come on those beans had a purpose the timing of that had a purpose that land that that heritage that inheritance had a purpose and Shama wasn't just being you know a renegade he was planting himself in the purpose of the Lord and in order to do that he had to see beyond the beans and - see this is a promise from God now go way back and we'll give you a land I'm gonna give you the inhabitants of the land you're gonna run them out I'm gonna give you the fruit of the land we'll give you the harvest of the land I'm gonna do this and that the other and here the Philistines this was part of a promise and God allowed Shama to look above the beans and above his hungry children and see a purpose and a plan and a destiny that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world can we stand and God God in Shama hear me God got in him I don't know if it was a sword I don't know if it was an ox Gold I don't know if it was a sack of beans but all I know is he knocked every one of those Philistines down knocked them until they were dead and the Lord say that with me and the Lord brought a great victory why because God put himself in the hands of a man God put himself in the hands of a man God found a man that would cooperate with his purpose and plan God found a man that valued what he valued come on now God found a man that was willing to fight instead of flee to stand on truth this is not something you do in a closet there's a time for that there's a time for personal commitment there's a time for quiet devotion there's a time to recommit and rededicate our lives to the Lord and the privacy of our door with the door closed in the privacy of our prayer closet but I want you to know there was no time to go hide in a prayer closet this was a battle that had to be won in in in in the eyes of of all those scaredy-cat allies this was a battle that had to be it won in the eyes of all the enemy come on now this was serious business and what you are fighting for the seed that you have sown is serious business come on how many of you have sown you've just you just you don't we're not gonna classify and clarify we're just gonna say how many of know you've sown seed that you haven't reaped from yet every one of us every one of us I mean we've reap we've been blessed God has helped us all along but I know there are things I know there seed that have gone into the ground that I have not yet seen the fruit of I cannot abandon my seed now I've got to stand in war against every wall of the enemy if that's what it takes so that God can get in my hands God can get in my shoe leather and win the battle one man in God we used to sing one man and God can triumph for a thousand one man in God puts Satan on the run so don't be weary stand up for God and see one man and God can win the victory how many of you believe God will fight for you if you are willing to fight with him with him with him we can't do it without him sister Laura come to the music and any of the rest of you for just a moment I know you think we're the only church in the world where the preacher preaches two plus hours you're so wrong I was listening to a sermon this week from a message church in the United States and I was listening to it most of the day while I was working and doing some other things Benjamin come in he says he still preaching I said he's still preaching same service same service same sermon I said so son you need to know I'm not I'm not the only one but I can't help it if I feel like I've got something to say if I can find two or three people who want to hear it I want you to fight I want you to fight you may be too tired to fight right now but I want you to fight I want you to stand for what God has has given you and what he has called you to and I want you not to be defeated not run but to take courage and let God get in your hand don't abandon your seat children don't do it don't allow the enemy to let you do it to force you to do it or pull you a way to do it father we thank you this morning you are God's sovereign you are God's supreme you are holy and wonderful and righteous and faithful and and good in all of your ways you have not left us alone in Satan's Eden but you have filled us with a holy seed an incorruptible word that can only produce the life of God it cannot feed the flesh but it feeds the spirit Oh God every day of our lives as we allow that word to penetrate us we are being made and conformed and re remade into the image of the one who sends that word in the beginning because we have the promise of an eternity with you Lord ruling and reigning over the nations Lord some of us struggle to keep our own checkbook in order we can hardly imagine a day that you would allow us to rule and reign with you over the nation's but you have called us and not only that you said we were judge nations and angels the bride has a Dominion and an authority that Satan desires to rob to steal one handful at a time one being at a time but lord I thank you that you are jealous over the harvest we are not the only ones who have an investment in the seed that we have sown ultimately every bit of it came from you every gift every talent every every effort every financial seed every bit of our sowing was ultimately because you put it in our hand or you put it in our life you deposit it in us so you're jealous over that seed and lord I thank you that you're standing up in such an hour is this calling to find anybody anybody who will refuse to allow the enemy to come in and fare it away what we have planted what we have put our hope in what we have trusted you to do so lord I ask you to make this a reality this month I wish that it could been could have been brought in a more dynamic way but I ask you Father to burn this in somebody's heart when the way gets hard this week when that when emotions squeeze us I pray Lord that this burning word will rise up in somebody and they will say not this time devil not this time Satan I am NOT going to abandon my seed I'm not going to run from the field I'm going to stand here and defend because I believe the Lord of the harvest is coming to give us the increase we call for the lord of the harvest to come and strengthen us and anoint us and inspire us to stand firm my god let my feet to ask the Lord right now let my feet be planted in the house of your habitation in the place of your dwelling where your name is I want my feet to be planted in the purpose and destiny that you have called us to hallelujah run if you want to run if you will but I came here to stay let some of us have a theme like that let's some of us carry that in our lives you alone are worthy even though Shama stood and even though Shama struck down the Philistines it was you Oh God it was you Oh God who won the victory it was you Oh God who deserve the glory it is you who deserves the praise for you are so faithful great is thy faithfulness or God great is thy faithfulness Oh God in this room there are those O Lord who have sewn and sewn and sewn in faith O God and the enemy has come maybe targeting to steal harvest I pray Lord today that you would cause each one everyone to have a faith reality check that we would value again what we have once valued and fight again for what we have once laid our lives down for if the enemy has moved any of us one inch from the truth that brought us out Oh God let us every one be found right back dab in the middle of everything that is holy and everything that is pure and everything that is true and everything that is virtuous and valuable we need your grace O God if there is a spirit of compromise that is creeping into our life may we raise the sword may we raise a weapon of whatever is in our hand and refuse to bend or to bow refuse to reason with the devil who tabali Kondabolu yay here labas and allah Boresha kama honda nan de l'homme oh yeah yeaaah Lamas ah Ronda loboko sure thank you Jesus butoh soul hallelujah lord I thank you lord I thank you I thank you I thank you I thank
