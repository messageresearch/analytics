TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you you you hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly of the New Hope revival ministries in Smith station Alabama USA I want to welcome you to the Eagles cry broadcast today I want to tell you what a privilege and honor it is to be able to come to you every week on these fine Christian networks that God is raising up in the end time to take the gospel and the bride's message I trust all over the world I want to thank God for the gospel channel I want to thank God for angel TV and I want you to join with me in prayer that God will bless the men and women of God who are involved in these fine Christian networks that the Holy Spirit will continue to anoint and that the Lord will continue to provide the finances that are needed so that these ministries can not only be maintained but so they can be expanded I just really thank God that he would bless me with strength and health to be with you again this week on the Eagles cry in our last broadcast we ended the broadcast by reading first Corinthians chapter 14 verses 7 and 8 i'd like to read that quickly for you again and even things without life-giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to battle and we talked about how that different musical instruments have different tones and different sounds but even on one particular musical instrument like the trumpet or the shofar that is made from from the ram's horn there are different sounds that can come forth from the brass trumpet or or silver trumpet or from the shofar and some of you know that in different military exercises in different armies around the world for instance the trumpet or the bugle is used in the United States we have known for years the the trumpet or the the blast that would wake everyone up revelry the sound to to get everybody up and going on the bugle and then of course taps to retire everyone at night and if you've ever in the United States if you've ever attended a military funeral a funeral of someone who has served in the US military you've heard that lonesome sound of taps being played even as the casket was being lowered into the ground so different songs can come forth from the same instrument and so we need to be able to know what instrument we're hearing and what song or sound we're hearing and what it means for us is it time to get up or is it time to go to bed is it time to come together and march to battle or is it a time to retreat what is the trumpet saying in this hour and how should we respond we really need the Holy Spirit don't we we need the Holy Spirit in this hour to anoint our eyes to see and our ears to hear we need the Holy Spirit to give us revelation of the word because we need to know the day and the hour that we're living in I don't mean I mean we can go to the calendar and see that this is 2013 and we can find out what month it is and what day it is and we can look at our watching and see what time it is but I'm talking about an entirely different timing altogether not Chronos time but God's timing what our are we living in what is this age what is this generation what is the message for the hour that we're living in right now I believe that the message that's going forth for this hour for this day for this generation is a message to prepare the Bride of Christ I believe it is a separating message I do I believe that the true revelation of Jesus Christ once it strikes your life it so transforms you that it it forces a separation because you are no longer satisfied to be a lazy happy-go-lucky everyday run-of-the-mill church member you are now on a journey to to discover the heartbeat of God you want to know not just not just the simple interpretation of the scripture but you want a revelation you want the Holy Spirit to come in quicken that word in you and make you alive and transform you from the inside out and when that begins to happen in you and that transformation begins to take place in your life you're just changed and sometimes we say the things that we once loved we're not interested in any more the things we hate it at one time we're now passionate for this is a it's not just the conversion experience or being born again but we're talking about the revelation for call come up higher I want to show you things which shall be Hereafter so what we're praying for in this hour is for a message to come forth to the Bride of Christ around the world in every nation of the world that will be so clear so pure so accurate all of man's ideas plucked out of it traditional dogmas and creeds and denominational theories plucked out of it straight pure revelation of the word the Bible tells us in the book of revelation that the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus or the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy and we need that we need the testimony of Jesus we need the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ and how does it come it comes by the prophetic it comes by the unction of the Holy Ghost even in our own individual lives it's not enough for us to seek out profits in this hour we've also got to have prophetic unction is as ordinary believers you know who may not feel the call to be a major in time profit but but we do feel the call to make up a part of the Bride of Christ and in that call we need to ask the Holy Spirit to sharpen up our prophetic perception so that we can hear the trumpet know what the trumpet is saying to us and we also need to ask for grace to be able to respond and obey sometimes even when we know what God is asking us to do we have a hard time doing it and so I pray often lord give me the grace I need grace grace like Zechariah talks about I need double grace maybe even triple quadruple gray some time to do what God is calling me to do in this hour and I know I'm not alone in fact I know that a multitude of you out there feel ill-equipped to be what God has called you to be in fact you've probably ask him a dozen times or more like I have why did you choose me why did you call me and you can spend the rest of your life asking him why or you can spend that time asking him to empower you and equip you to go forth and do what he's called you to do and i guarantee you whatever God has called you to do in this hour he has the grace the grace is available to be able to do whatever it is that he's asked of you I remember a generation ago one of God's great servants a prophet by the name of William Marion Branham he said one time that in the end time there must come forth a end time message that will meet in time conditions in other words the conditions are going to be bleak they're going to be dark there's going to be some serious things unfolding on the planet and God's message for that hour will have to arise and meet every challenge and every condition that the end times will present in fact he said when that end time message comes forth it will take us all the way back to the original word I don't know about you but that makes my spirit man stand up it makes me come to attention and it makes me desire to be a part of that end time message that's going forth even now to call us back to the original word out of paganism out of church creeds and dogmas out of man worship out of the intimidation and fear of man and all of those stifling religious regulations that have been placed on our lives by man and not by the Holy Spirit we want for Holy Spirit of God to teach us how to live our lives I want you to know I believe in holiness I believe God is calling his bride to walk before him as a true reflection of his holiness you see all my righteousness all my holiness is still filthy rags in the sight of a holy and righteous God it's only when I become a mirror it's only when I become a mirror that I can become a reflection of his glory and his holiness and his purity and I asked the Lord Lord make me a mirror make me a reflector of your holiness and your purity when God reveals to you his holiness and his purity again there's going to be a separation that will come in your life you're going to find that there are some things that are not helpful for you anymore there are some things that are not healthy for you anymore and gods going to call you out of some destructive patterns and destructive behavior and your friends and family are going to look at you like you've lost your mind but it's just a return to the word it's just God calling you back and I am so sick and tired like you and everybody else in the world of hypocrisy I believe it's time for the pure righteous bride of Jesus Christ to stand up and be counted in this as those who have laid down their lives just laid down their lives before the Lord and said I am nothing I have nothing I can accomplish nothing without you so come and live in my life and be what you can be and what you are I need that I need that to be able to go forward in this hour so we need an end time message that will be so pure and so clear that it will call us back to the original word it will help us to to go through our ideas with a fine-tooth comb find anything in there that is not biblical it's not word based and get rid of it so that we can move forward to be the hands and the feet and the mouthpiece of God for the end time brides revival I believe many of you are being positioned and called for such a time as this to be a part of that great move of God that's coming on the earth now the scripture talks about how we can know that we're truly living in the end time how can we know we know because of birth pains we start watching for those birth pains let me give you a definition of what birth pains are birth pains in terms of Bible prophecy refer to a certain convulsive geopolitical geophysical astrophysical and worldwide socio-economic event and issues scheduled to occur in the time leading up to the second coming of the lord jesus christ i hope you followed all that because i didn't it's a theological definition a little complicated i think we can break it down for you a little bit easier than that by looking at the words of the Lord that's what the church is saying about it and I think it's accurate but it would require defining each one of those terms so let's look at what the scripture said in Matthew chapter 24 beginning in verse 3 and as he at upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world now there are three questions that are being asked by the disciples in this verse of scripture three distinct events three distinct questions and what we need the Holy Spirit to help us discern is when he gives the answers which of these three questions is he answering when because the questions are tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and the sign of the coming of the end of the world so we have three questions and three answers in this chapter and sometimes this can be very confusing when we try to put this on a timeline and determine what is going to happen when Jesus went on to say in verse 4 take heed that no man deceive you now that's a message in itself it's an important message because it comes from the lips of our Messiah Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ he is answering he's beginning to answer the questions that his disciples have asked concerning the end time and the first thing he says he doesn't jump right in and start explaining the signs of the end of the world or the signs of his coming the first thing he says is take heed that no man deceive you so I think we are safe to assume that in the end time that period is going to be marked with great deception in fact verse 5 helps define that deception where many shall come in my name saying I am Christ I am Messiah and shall deceive many and you know that even right now in the world there are men who have risen up to declare themselves as thus the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ they're great communes large communities of followers who have identified in in almost all cultures someone who is like unto or in some cases they believe he is the reincarnation or how whatever the terminology would be in fact this man is the Lord Jesus Christ who has come the second time and jesus knew that 2,000 years ago he knew that that was going to increase now this was going on in the time of the scripture because even at the at the hour that Jesus was speaking to his disciples there were already those who had risen up during this Roman a beginning of the Roman occupation of Jerusalem there were those who had risen up and declared themselves to be the Messiah and so there was a lot of division and in the in the ensuing years the years after the Lord Jesus Christ there were many who rose up and declared and decreed themselves to be the Messiah so this is something that Jesus said we needed to watch for he was speaking to those hearing him in that hour and he's also speaking to us in this hour and you will hear of wars and rumors of wars I can say that that could certainly be talking about the hour we're living in today as well as some of the things that were going on in the world when this was being spoken see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places now how many of you can say that sounds like the news that sounds like the newspaper or the television news or the radio news famines pestilences earthquakes in diverse places but verse 8 is worthy of taking a moment of our time to look at it says all these all of these things that are thus described are the beginning of Sorrows this is not the end of the end just yet you'll see all of these things happening and that will be the beginning of Sorrows now Jesus speaks more to his disciples then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted verse 9 and shall kill you and you shall be hated of All Nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall arise and shall deceive many we had false christs a moment ago now false prophets and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but look at verse 13 here again we have a contrast between the perspective of looking out at hearing the news and seeing what's going on right now and then the perspective of of getting up in the spirit and looking down at things from God's point of view and here comes verse 13 to encourage us but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved and I'll tell you right now you can't endure to the end without the help and the grace of the lord jesus christ you won't be able to stand the circumstances that are coming on the earth if it were not for the grace of god to endure and to stand and verse 14 and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall be income so these verses that we've just read have certain applications for the time in which Jesus was speaking and in the years that would follow for instance the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem was sort of a culmination and it was historians say it was an event that changed life as it had been known in other words the destruction of the temple was such a devastating event to the Jewish people that it changed a culture it changed the way they worshiped it changed so much until really there are a certain there is a certain aspect of these scriptures that were definitely fulfilled in a measure in that time we can say that of a surety however there is other applications there are other applications we should say of these scriptures that are being fulfilled in the hour that we're living in right now if God's Word was true 2,000 years ago it's certainly true today but he that endureth to the end shall be saved and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the income what I'm trying to say to you is a lot of what we see going on in the world right now are the birth pangs that were spoken about in the scripture when I read to you just a moment ago Matthew chapter 24 and verse 8 in the King James Version it says all these are the beginning of Sorrows in the New International Version it says all these are the beginning of birth pains the new American Bible said all these are the beginning of labor pains the new American Standard said but all these are merely the beginning of the birth pains wyeth new testament says but all these miseries are but like the early pains of childbirth and the world english bible said but all these things are the beginning of birth pain so many translations of the Bible take this word sorrow and specifically interpret it to be the sorrow the pain that a woman goes through the travail and the labor that a woman goes through in giving birth and there's something that we know about labor and that is it starts off mild the contractions I think is what called the labor pains they start off mild and they start off with large gaps between them and as labor increases and the time of delivery is nearer what happens is the pains become more intense and the time and the duration of those paints is longer and the interval between those pains actually becomes shorter because now the baby is dropping into the birth canal it's time for that precious baby to make its appearance here on planet earth and so labor has to to intensify the pains get more severe and the amount of time between the panes gets less and less and less that's what we're going to see in the earth that's what we are beginning to see now labor pains we have seen the beginning of Sorrows now we're getting ready to enter into a period of time where we're no longer going to call it the beginning of Sorrows we're going to begin to have to identify the hour we're living in is full on set labor because the baby is dropping down in the canal and it's time for Messiah to come forth and receive his precious bride it's time for the manchild it's time for not only the Messiah but it's time for an overcoming remnant of people to be raised up in the character and the attributes and the power of the Lord Jesus Christ with his authority I might add because we it's not just more power we need to be operating in when we take the gospel to the needy it's the authority of God I'm telling you the authority of God supersedes power and so we need we need more power but we need the authority of God and the only way that we can have the authority of God is to begin to discover who we are because when we discover who we are spiritually and prophetically it changes the way we relate to go and when we relate to God in a proper way in proper alignment he releases to us more of his authority I believe the power of the spoken word not just the spoken word but the creative spoken word is going to be in the mouth of the Bride of Christ in the end time I believe she's going to have the creative word of God in her mouth so we've got a lot of ugly things to expect on the planet but we also have a glorious period of time where the overcoming remnant bride will rise up with the power of the creative spoken word in her mouth she will come to the full adoption of sons with it with the same authority that Jesus Christ had when he was here on the earth Abby and that transforms us from who we are where we are from what church we go to it transforms us from our old identity to a new identity and our new identity is mrs. Jesus Christ mrs. Yeshua the Messiah that is our new identity I hope that doesn't offend you but if it offends your religion and okay because that's not going to be enough in the end time brother sister religion is not going to be enough to empower you to stand in this last hour it's only an intimate relationship with our Lord a total transformed life that's going to be able to stand against the wiles of the enemy in this hour I'm going to pray for you as we go off the air that God will release to you another dimension of the Holy Spirit of God that it will become so fresh and so new and so real in your life that you'll be snatched out of depression and discouragement and you'll be lifted into a new realm one perhaps you've never walked in before with the joy of the Lord but we've got to have the joy we need the power of God we've got to have the authority of God but we also need the joy of the Lord why because the joy of the Lord is our strength and we need strength in this hour to be able to stand so I asked the Lord right now father I thank you for this broadcast I thank you for every viewer that you have positioned in front of this program today and I ask you to bring healing to their body and mind I ask you to restore joy to those whom the enemy has stolen it from I ask you Lord to anoint our eyes give us revelation from your word to know the hour that we're living in in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah we pray amen thank you for watching the broadcast today please contact us this week and let us know that you're watching and that the Holy Spirit is speaking to your heart tune in again next time for the Eagles cry bye-bye for today you
