Description:
God knew our weaknesses, our predispositions.  Before we were ever born He saw our generational tendencies, every addiction coming through our bloodlines that would touch our life, and He made provision to overcome.  We are awakening to the purposes of our destiny, we are here to manifest the things our Father has spoken.  We are an expression of the thought processes of the Living God.  We are about to understand who we really are.
