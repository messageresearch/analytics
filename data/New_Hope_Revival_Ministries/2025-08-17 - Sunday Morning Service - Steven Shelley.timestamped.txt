[32:07] You wanted me to come into a realm where
[32:10] you are, Lord. You did not want me to

[32:23] you knew that there was fear and

[32:31] trials. You gave me something that would
[32:34] help me to become stronger and more
[32:37] courageous so that I could put the devil
[32:39] under my feet and walk through that
[32:42] door. Lord, I thank you for divine love
[32:45] that casts out all fear so that I can
[32:49] walk through the open door that you have
[32:51] created for me to walk through.

[33:05] &gt;&gt; fellow believers, the saints that have
[33:08] been called together.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; You know their individual places,
[33:13] &gt;&gt; the path that you've put them on. But
[33:15] Lord, you have called us as individuals
[33:19] to come up higher.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; And I thank you that you have given us
[33:23] the tests
[33:25] &gt;&gt; to overcome one by one so that we can go
[33:28] higher. That's because you're a good
[33:31] good father.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; You didn't want us to blend into
[33:36] society.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; You wanted us to be above it.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; Not because we're better than someone
[33:45] else, but because Lord, you have placed
[33:47] a high and a holy calling upon our
[33:50] lives.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; As the elect lady,
[33:55] &gt;&gt; we worship you.
[33:58] We worship you.
[34:01] Great is our God.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Do you have a need? As we go to the Lord
[34:11] in prayer today, you just want to lift
[34:12] your hand to the Lord. The Lord sees
[34:15] your hand. He knows your need.
[34:18] Knows how to help you in this hour.
[34:20] Those of you on the stream that are
[34:22] watching this service, the needs that
[34:24] you have, the Lord sees those needs.
[34:27] He's willing and able to help you and
[34:29] give you strength in this hour.
[34:33] You're a good good father.
[34:36] Thank you, Lord.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Will you pray? Um, let let me see just a
[34:40] minute. I'm so sorry, but uh
[34:43] Jesus, we worship you.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, my
[34:50] sister Terry is she she's here, isn't
[34:52] she? Sister Terry is a new grandmother.
[34:55] I guess she knew that already, did she?
[34:58] Sister Hannah has uh had her baby this
[35:00] morning. Ain't that wonderful?
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Wonderful.
[35:04] [Applause]
[35:07] Praise you, Lord.
[35:09] And it's a big thing. I'll tell you that
[35:11] right now. At least it looks that way in
[35:13] the picture. Huh? It's not big. That was
[35:17] a closeup, I guess. Would you pray this
[35:20] morning for Jonathan Hollis whose leg
[35:22] was swelled even larger today and he's
[35:26] in a tremendous amount of pain at times
[35:28] and they just told him it must be some
[35:31] kind of infection in that leg. Let's ask
[35:33] the Lord to to uh give him a miracle
[35:36] today. It's certainly not like him not
[35:38] to be able to be in service for sure.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; So, we want to hold him up to the Lord.
[35:42] And uh David said Ashley didn't sleep
[35:44] very well uh last night and would need
[35:48] some rest and our prayers and I would
[35:50] think that every mother in this room
[35:52] knows how all that works and would show
[35:55] extra compassion toward her. Uh maybe
[35:58] they're streaming. If they are, pray
[36:00] that David will do his part and more
[36:03] and not be a slacker at a time like
[36:05] this.
[36:07] Is he on reckoning? Let's smile at him.
[36:11] um pray for Zach's family, would you?
[36:13] They're they're uh woke up in the middle
[36:15] of the night and were vomiting and they
[36:18] don't want that to spread and so they'd
[36:20] like for us to remember them to the Lord
[36:21] in prayer. Sister Rebecca Shephard is uh
[36:25] it's a bit of a trial because Matthew's
[36:27] leaving today and going off to college
[36:29] and um and and she just needs our
[36:32] prayers. That's that would not be easy
[36:34] and we want to hold her up to the Lord.
[36:37] Brother Bobby uh Wartz, who we mentioned
[36:40] to you the other day, he uh is not
[36:43] getting maybe the best reports. We don't
[36:45] know exactly what's being said, but he
[36:47] does have an appointment this coming
[36:49] week at the Mayo Clinic
[36:50] &gt;&gt; and uh they're going to continue to see
[36:53] what they might do and and and what the
[36:55] prognosis is. But we serve a great big
[36:59] wonderful capable healing Jesus. And I
[37:03] know there are others, but I didn't get
[37:05] a chance to get them all wrote down
[37:07] before I came out today. But let's just
[37:09] lift them up. Even if we don't know each
[37:11] detail, we're going to lift them up.
[37:13] Brother Daniel, that's right. Um when I
[37:16] drove on the property today, he met me
[37:19] near the mailbox and said he was going
[37:21] to be checked out at the emergency room.
[37:23] I prayed for him. He was laded and was
[37:26] having some strange pain around his
[37:28] chest area. And uh I felt like the Lord
[37:31] moved. I really did. But of course, he
[37:34] wanted to double check. And so that's
[37:37] all right. Let's pray that the Lord will
[37:40] heal him. Whatever's going on, he'll
[37:41] just walk out of it with a miracle.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:47] We want to take all of these needs to
[37:49] our papa,
[37:51] our father. He knows all about every one
[37:54] of them. Sing the chorus of this song.
[37:58] Sister Jeffrey usually sings.
[38:01] I know the peace
[38:04] speaker.
[38:07] I know him by name.
[38:14] I know the peace
[38:17] speaker.
[38:20] He controls the wind and waves.
[38:27] When he says peace be still,
[38:32] they have to obey.
[38:39] I know the peace
[38:42] speaker.
[38:45] I know him by name. Brother Hawk, will
[38:49] you come and pray today?
[38:52] I know the peace
[38:55] speaker.
[38:58] I know him by name.
[39:05] I know the peace
[39:08] speaker.
[39:11] He controls the wind and waves.
[39:17] When he says peace be still,
[39:23] they have to obey.
[39:27] [Music]
[39:30] I know the peace
[39:34] speaker.
[39:36] I know him by name.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise
[39:44] the Lord.
[39:46] Hallelujah.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you
[39:52] that you have revealed your name to us.
[39:54] You have
[39:56] &gt;&gt; What a privilege to know you by name.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. to know you personally.
[40:04] Father, we know you
[40:07] as a loving father, a loving God
[40:11] &gt;&gt; that is full of mercy

[40:20] as a miracle working God. You are
[40:27] &gt;&gt; you are glorified and honored
[40:32] &gt;&gt; when we believe you and your promises
[40:36] for our own individual lives.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; You're honored when we receive them by
[40:42] faith.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, you went through so much
[40:49] to reveal your love to us.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, you did. to come into this earth.
[40:54] Humble yourself as a servant.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Manifest yourself as a lamb.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; What a mystery.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; But so big
[41:06] it was love that took you all the way to
[41:09] the cross.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; May we see that it was your love to us.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; May all of us see it for our oursel. It
[41:19] was your love for us.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; And in that love, you healed us. And
[41:25] right now, there are people that need
[41:29] healing in their bodies.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; And Father, in that name that you reveal
[41:34] to us in the name of Yeshua.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we ask that you would heal those
[41:40] that are needy right now. for brother
[41:43] Bobby right now. May the miracle working
[41:47] power of the almighty God manifest in
[41:50] his body right now in the name of Yeshua

[42:12] our heart you're making yourself so
[42:15] real. I want to thank you for
[42:17] revelation.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; You want to be known.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; And father, we want to know you
[42:25] intimately. We want to know everything
[42:27] about you. And father, we love you
[42:30] today. We bless you for who you are. We

[42:36] &gt;&gt; Let the purposes of God unfold in this
[42:38] service
[42:40] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[42:43] Amen.

[42:57] Thank you for meeting the needs, Lord.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you as you have
[43:04] your seat today.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Sister Flo, you going to come and sing?
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; We're glad to have you in the house of
[43:20] the Lord with us today.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Jenna has her mother, Sister Melinda,
[43:24] and her sister Joy. We're glad that
[43:26] they're here visiting with us. May the
[43:28] Lord bless you.
[43:33] [Applause]
[43:34] Tiffany, is this Joshua's son that
[43:39] your nephew? All right, Jeremiah, we're
[43:41] glad that you're here today. God bless
[43:43] you.

[43:58] Jessica, it's nice to see you and the
[44:00] grandbaby here with us today. God bless
[44:02] you.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that I'm a believer
[44:10] &gt;&gt; in the Lord Jesus Christ. Everybody's a
[44:13] believer in something,
[44:15] &gt;&gt; but I'm glad that I'm a believer in the
[44:17] Lord Jesus Christ, the one true living
[44:20] God who gives us the help and strength
[44:22] that we need every day of our life to
[44:24] keep pressing on. And that's what we do.
[44:27] We press on by the grace of God. God
[44:30] bless you, Sister Flo.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[44:41] I was reading the scripture. I believe
[44:43] it was yesterday.
[44:46] And I want to
[44:49] say this, and I want you to really take
[44:51] it to heart.
[44:54] I was reading where
[44:57] God was telling all the animals
[45:00] to go into the ark.
[45:03] Um, Moses, he told Moses how to build
[45:05] the ark.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Noah,
[45:07] &gt;&gt; I mean Noah. Thank you, brother Shel.
[45:10] And
[45:12] [Music]
[45:13] sometime I think when we read we kind of
[45:17] skip things or
[45:19] &gt;&gt; it just don't click or something. No
[45:21] telling how many times I've read it, but
[45:23] it just clicked within me.
[45:27] We as human beings, we think we smart
[45:33] and we think, you know, we know a lot.
[45:36] We do. We do
[45:38] cuz we've listened and read and studied
[45:41] and but I read something that I had
[45:43] never noticed before.
[45:47] Have you ever wondered
[45:50] I know I know you you think you know.
[45:53] Have you ever wondered how all those
[45:57] animals
[45:59] all those bugs and gnats and flies and
[46:03] &gt;&gt; mosquitoes and all of that? How did how
[46:07] did it all gather together and go into
[46:10] the art? Have you ever thought about
[46:13] that? I mean, just think about how many
[46:15] bugs there are in the world.
[46:18] I hope all the roach bugs go somewhere.
[46:20] I hate them things. But anyway,
[46:23] I got to thinking about that and it says
[46:26] that the Lord
[46:30] moved on them.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about
[46:37] how important
[46:39] it is for God to move on you?
[46:45] Like the song says, without him, we are
[46:48] nothing.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; We don't have no goal or nothing.
[46:55] But I just thank God with all my heart.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; I'm a fail. I probably fail God more
[47:00] than any of you here. I feel that way.
[47:03] And when we get to thinking we don't,
[47:05] there's something wrong with us.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; But I thank God. I don't know how to
[47:12] thank him. And I tell him, I don't know
[47:13] how to thank you for calling me
[47:17] &gt;&gt; and choosing me and filling me
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[47:20] &gt;&gt; with your precious spirit.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; I hope I do this good. I want to because
[47:26] you're the bride.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; It makes me nervous to sing before you
[47:30] because you are the bride.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God. All right, sister.
[47:37] your only son.
[47:41] No sin to hide.
[47:45] But you have sent
[47:48] him from your side
[47:52] to walk upon
[47:55] this guilty son
[47:59] and to become the lamb
[48:03] of God.
[48:07] Oh lamb of God,
[48:10] sweet lamb of God.
[48:14] I love the holy
[48:17] lamb of God.
[48:20] Oh, wash me in
[48:23] his precious blood.
[48:26] My Jesus Christ, the lamb of God.
[48:32] [Music]
[48:34] your gift of love.
[48:37] They crucified.
[48:40] They laughed and scorned
[48:43] him as he died.
[48:46] The humble king.
[48:49] They named a fraud
[48:52] and sacrificed
[48:54] the lamb of God.
[48:59] Oh lamb of God.
[49:02] Sweet lamb of God.
[49:05] I love the holy
[49:08] lamb of God.
[49:11] Oh, wash be
[49:14] his precious blood.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; My Jesus Christ, the lamb of God.
[49:24] I was so lost.
[49:27] I should have died,
[49:30] but you have brought
[49:33] me to your side
[49:36] to be led by
[49:39] your staff and rod
[49:42] &gt;&gt; and to be called a lamb.
[49:49] Oh lamb of God,
[49:52] sweet lamb of God.
[49:55] I love the holy
[49:58] lamb of God.
[50:01] Oh, wash me.
[50:04] His precious blood.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; By Jesus Christ, the lamb of God.
[50:13] Oh lamb of God.
[50:16] Sweet lamb of God.
[50:19] I love that hope
[50:23] lamb of God.
[50:25] Oh, wash me in
[50:28] his precious blood.
[50:31] My Jesus Christ, the lamb of God.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, wash me in
[50:41] his precious blood.
[50:44] My Jesus Christ the lamb.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:54] Hallelujah.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Sister Flo.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful that
[51:30] God has vessels that have stood the test
[51:32] of time.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Someone like Sister Flo that still wants
[51:37] to sing for the glory of God.
[51:42] I'm like her. I live for the presence of
[51:45] the Lord
[51:46] &gt;&gt; to be in his presence.
[51:50] I'm
[51:50] &gt;&gt; grateful for his mercy
[51:55] that he would call me as he has called
[51:59] you
[52:02] out of the millions and billions of
[52:04] people in the world.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we question why. Why would he
[52:09] call us?
[52:11] It has to be
[52:14] the sovereignty and election of God.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; That he he knew.
[52:21] He knew all of my makeup. He knew all of
[52:24] what I was made of.
[52:27] knew where to put me and how to put me
[52:29] and what trials to take me through that
[52:32] would build me into exactly what he
[52:35] wanted me to be
[52:37] &gt;&gt; because he knew what he had called.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; I'm grateful for that.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Ellas, would you help us today?
[52:43] And brother Ian will let the these
[52:46] brothers come to you today for the tithe
[52:48] and the offering we give as unto the
[52:50] Lord. The Lord has blessed us to be able
[52:53] to uh have our substance and everything
[52:57] that we have is because of him and we
[53:00] gladly give him the tithe. It belongs to
[53:03] him. It wasn't ours to start with. It
[53:06] belongs to him and we add an offering
[53:08] there too because that we love him and
[53:11] we're thankful for what he has done for
[53:13] us. May the Lord bless you as you give
[53:15] to the Lord today. Let's worship
[53:18] together as we are preparing our hearts
[53:20] for the preaching of the word.
[53:28] [Music]
[53:35] Hallelujah.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; You call the sun to rise.

[59:28] and I,
[59:34] Lord, I'm lost without you.
[59:38] [Music]
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; And I
[59:45] [Music]
[59:49] Oh, I'm for you.
[59:53] [Music]
[59:58] And
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; I'm lost without you.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, sing it just like that again.
[1:00:13] [Music]
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're desperate for you,
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Yes.
[1:00:24] Yes, we're desperate.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; We're so grateful.
[1:00:30] [Music]
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; My God, you always supply.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; I'm lost without you.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; You supply everything we need. I'm lost
[1:00:41] without you. And I
[1:00:50] lost
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; without you.
[1:00:54] Praise God I am. Let's give the Lord a
[1:00:57] praise with our hands clapping
[1:01:00] like the Bible said.
[1:01:03] [Applause]
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:10] Monitor. Like the Bible said,
[1:01:14] we are so thankful that he has daily
[1:01:17] bread. Yes.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; When Jesus was in the temptation
[1:01:22] and the enemy promised him what he
[1:01:25] really didn't have to give, Jesus
[1:01:28] resisted him by saying clearly.
[1:01:35] I don't know why this thing keeps
[1:01:37] getting so out of whack.
[1:01:42] Man shall not live by bread alone,
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; but by every word that proceedth out of
[1:01:48] the mouth of God. That's daily bread.
[1:01:50] That's living bread.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful for it. And it's better
[1:01:54] than any biscuit you've ever had. I'll
[1:01:56] tell you that right now. Uh amen. Let's
[1:01:58] thank God for the musicians.
[1:02:03] [Applause]
[1:02:07] I want you to get your Bible ready.
[1:02:09] While you're standing, we're going to go
[1:02:11] to Jeremiah 48:1.
[1:02:15] And then we're going to First Peter
[1:02:17] chapter 2. We're very happy to see you
[1:02:20] in the house of the Lord today and glad
[1:02:23] for the presence of God. And this has
[1:02:26] been a week, hasn't it? We're alive and
[1:02:28] well. And we've got much to be thankful
[1:02:31] for. Nothing really to complain about.
[1:02:34] Even though there are troubles and
[1:02:36] trials and burdens that come along, uh
[1:02:39] we are blessed above blessed above
[1:02:42] blessed, we're thankful to have him, to
[1:02:45] know him and the power of his salvation.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're getting ready to enter not
[1:02:51] because it's my part, because it's his
[1:02:53] part, but we're getting ready to enter
[1:02:55] into the most important part of this
[1:02:57] service.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; And we are missing a lot of folks today.
[1:03:01] There's a lot of different things going
[1:03:02] on, but God's going to bring every one
[1:03:04] of them through
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; and we have a brand new baby boy born
[1:03:09] into the uh New Hope local family. We're
[1:03:13] so thankful for God blessing Ashley and
[1:03:16] David with a healthy baby boy. And uh I
[1:03:20] guess you have seen his name is Abel
[1:03:23] Joshua Yantis. And we're thankful for
[1:03:26] him and may he be able
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; to do everything God would lay on his
[1:03:32] life to do. Amen. And then to have
[1:03:34] another precious little baby born today
[1:03:37] to our streaming family one day
[1:03:40] hopefully local but streaming family for
[1:03:42] now. And we're excited about that as
[1:03:45] well. And uh this has been a season,
[1:03:48] these last few weeks has been an unusual
[1:03:51] season spiritually. God's doing
[1:03:53] something for a lot of people. It's just
[1:03:55] a sovereign thing that he's doing. And
[1:03:57] of course, that can make you There's all
[1:04:00] kinds of reactions that take place when
[1:04:02] people start drawing closer to the Lord.
[1:04:04] Backlash. You know, the enemy comes and
[1:04:07] he tries to distract them and hinder
[1:04:09] them in many ways. And I've been
[1:04:12] particularly nervous for the last three
[1:04:13] days, but I know that there is victory
[1:04:16] on the other side. And we cannot lose
[1:04:20] focus now. We've got to keep our eyes on
[1:04:23] the prize
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; because he's stepping out again from
[1:04:26] behind the lattice.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; If you missed him before, maybe you
[1:04:29] won't miss him this time. Recognize who
[1:04:32] he is. And this is not something we do
[1:04:35] for a hobby. We don't go to church by
[1:04:37] hobby. In fact, we don't just come
[1:04:39] unprepared. We don't come on a dry run.
[1:04:42] We prepare our hearts to be here.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you didn't, that may be why
[1:04:47] you're so distracted. But we prepared
[1:04:49] our hearts to be here today because we
[1:04:51] knew he would be here.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; And who would want to miss his
[1:04:55] appointment?
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to ask you that if
[1:04:58] you're a person that needs to go in and
[1:05:00] out of the building that you make it a
[1:05:03] habituh moving forward to sort of sit
[1:05:05] closer to the back. It doesn't really
[1:05:07] matter today. we have plenty of room for
[1:05:09] you, but it is very distracting at times
[1:05:12] if someone goes out three, four, five
[1:05:14] times during a sermon. Uh you may need
[1:05:17] to get in a healing line or you may need
[1:05:19] to see a doctor. Um I know we have long
[1:05:22] services. I understand that. And most of
[1:05:25] the time we just can kind of come up a
[1:05:27] little bit above it. But uh just lately
[1:05:30] there's just a whole lot of movement. I
[1:05:32] want you moving, but I want you moving
[1:05:34] in the spirit toward the Lord. And I'm
[1:05:36] not trying to chastise you. I'm just
[1:05:39] trying to tell you. I mean, if I were in
[1:05:41] a place uh and what I was doing was was
[1:05:44] really causing distraction to the person
[1:05:46] responsible, I I would want to know it
[1:05:48] so I could adjust myself.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; This is not a place to lay on one
[1:05:52] another.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Uh somebody said, "What if we're
[1:05:57] married?" I I said, "This is not a place
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; to lay on one another.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; This is a house of God. Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; You've got your home, your your living
[1:06:06] room, your bedroom, your car. If you
[1:06:08] feel like you need to be laying on one
[1:06:10] another, you can do that if you're
[1:06:11] married. If you're not, the Bible
[1:06:13] forbids it.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Bible forbids it.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; And I I want to stay with the word,
[1:06:20] don't you? This isn't fun that we're not
[1:06:22] just playing here. We're getting ready
[1:06:24] for a translation.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; And I want to be right in the middle of
[1:06:28] it.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we love you. We love
[1:06:31] everybody. And we it disturbs us to
[1:06:33] think that you might be fighting
[1:06:35] something physical. But if you are, you
[1:06:37] you don't need to be right up in the
[1:06:39] front. You need to find a place so that
[1:06:41] you can get in and out toward the back.
[1:06:43] Uh because not only are there people
[1:06:45] here trying to focus, but there are
[1:06:47] people on the stream who are really
[1:06:50] pulling with everything they've got
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; because they don't get to enjoy the full
[1:06:54] atmosphere.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Uh it's good. But I feel the anointings
[1:06:58] coming through even in archive when
[1:07:00] we're worshiping the Lord. But it's
[1:07:02] there's nothing like being in the middle
[1:07:04] of it.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; And and just when you feel like you just
[1:07:07] want to rest and be a little slack, just
[1:07:09] remember there are dozens of people who
[1:07:11] would love to have your spot
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; and would want to take full advantage of
[1:07:16] it for a little while until they got
[1:07:18] spoiled.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; That's just kind of the way it works,
[1:07:22] isn't it?
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; But we're looking for great things. We
[1:07:25] believe it's going to be the greatest
[1:07:26] camp meeting that we've ever had. We
[1:07:29] believe that it is a very, very
[1:07:31] prophetic hour and that God is doing
[1:07:34] lots of things. I want to be right in
[1:07:35] the middle of it.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; And if you've got another focus, you
[1:07:38] better you better make some adjustments.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; You really had because you don't want to
[1:07:44] miss what God is doing in this hour.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; It's big.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; I know it. I don't just think it. I know
[1:07:51] it. Uh, God bless every one of you who
[1:07:54] are streaming. I would I would take time
[1:07:56] to mention it, but may I just say it
[1:07:58] like this? We have folks uh as far away
[1:08:00] as Australia and Japan both on this
[1:08:04] morning. Uh UK um I I South Africa uh
[1:08:09] and Ghana and that's just on that's just
[1:08:12] on on Facebook. So we have a some other
[1:08:15] platforms where people are greeting us
[1:08:17] God's goodness and blessings to all of
[1:08:19] you. Jeremiah 48:11.
[1:08:22] We are in a series uh concerning uh
[1:08:27] well, just to boil it down, we're making
[1:08:30] wine. We're making wine for the King of
[1:08:33] Kings
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; and the Lord of Lords. And we're
[1:08:37] desperate for him and we're thirsty for
[1:08:41] him and we're lost without him. as we
[1:08:43] sung. We want our praise to be like
[1:08:46] ointment for his feet.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; As the song says, wine for him to drink.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; We're trying to allow him to get us
[1:08:56] ready. We can't get ready ourselves
[1:08:58] unless we surrender to him.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; And so, we have thoroughly covered the
[1:09:03] first vessel. And this is called
[1:09:05] racking. And it's where wine is poured
[1:09:08] from one vessel to another vessel. each
[1:09:11] time enhancing the process of
[1:09:14] fermentation. And we have thoroughly
[1:09:17] covered the vessel of misunderstanding.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; And and we're not we weren't finished
[1:09:22] with the notes, but we're moving on
[1:09:23] today. Uh we got hung up around the
[1:09:26] tent, the pavilion, the hiding place,
[1:09:29] the secret place of the Lord. And I'm
[1:09:31] not done with it, but I'm just going to
[1:09:33] move on for now because there's
[1:09:35] something very, very fresh on that for
[1:09:37] this hour, for this season. Uh but I
[1:09:40] feel like today we should move uh just a
[1:09:43] bit to the next vessel. But let's get
[1:09:45] the theme. Moab hath been at ease from
[1:09:48] his youth and he hath settled on his
[1:09:52] leaves. And that's the dregs as we have
[1:09:55] discovered for anyone uh not hearing
[1:09:58] this. That's the dregs that's left
[1:10:00] behind. It can be little pieces of the
[1:10:02] skin. It can be all kinds of uh debris
[1:10:05] that might get in the crushing process.
[1:10:08] Of course, in the Bible, it was crushed
[1:10:10] by the foot, by feet, and outside. And
[1:10:15] so, anything could get in. And those
[1:10:18] leaves, if they stay there, those drags
[1:10:21] will make the wine bitter. So Moab is
[1:10:25] the cousin to Israel, the other side of
[1:10:28] the Dead Sea, and he has never been
[1:10:31] dealt with. But God is about to deal
[1:10:33] with him according to Jeremiah's
[1:10:35] prophecy. And he said the reason why
[1:10:38] you've fared so well is you just
[1:10:41] remained in one vessel, but now it's
[1:10:43] time for you to be poured out of your
[1:10:45] maybe your comfort zone or what you've
[1:10:48] grown used to
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; and be poured into something altogether
[1:10:52] different. uh you have not been emptied
[1:10:54] from vessel to vessel neither hath he
[1:10:56] gone into captivity. Therefore his taste
[1:11:00] remained in him and his scent is not
[1:11:04] changed. What we know about wine making
[1:11:07] is the fragrance is as important as the
[1:11:11] taste and God wants to make
[1:11:14] transformation in us. Now go to first
[1:11:17] Peter I know you're still standing. 1
[1:11:20] Peter chapter 2 verse 11 and 12.
[1:11:29] Dearly beloved, I beseech you as
[1:11:33] strangers and pilgrims
[1:11:37] abstain from fleshly lusts. That could
[1:11:42] be the word desires also. which war
[1:11:47] again, notice
[1:11:49] not against the spirit.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; The spirit has been regenerated
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; by the spirit of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; You don't have the same spirit.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; I know the controversy.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; I understand it. But the scriptures are
[1:12:06] clear. The war takes place not in
[1:12:09] spirit.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; You'll hear brother Bam saying that
[1:12:12] sometime, but he's talking about the
[1:12:14] soul.
[1:12:15] because the spirit has died and a new
[1:12:18] spirit. That's what the scripture said.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; You've now put the life of Christ in
[1:12:23] there and that old spirit has been
[1:12:25] transfigured.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; You now carry the gene of God.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; It's pretty powerful. Your your natural
[1:12:33] DNA has been overrode, overridden by
[1:12:37] spiritual DNA.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; That means you can believe God for
[1:12:41] anything he promises in his word.
[1:12:44] Because that word has now become a part
[1:12:46] of you. You have now become a part of
[1:12:48] that word. Where does the war come? The
[1:12:50] war comes against the soul
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; which is the mind, the will and the
[1:12:58] emotions.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Now you think about what you're going
[1:13:01] through right now other than a physical
[1:13:03] sickness. If you're going through any
[1:13:05] other trial and it can also affect you,
[1:13:09] a physical sickness can affect you in
[1:13:11] that way. But any other trial that
[1:13:13] you're going through and you boil it
[1:13:15] down, is it is it in the regenerated
[1:13:18] spirit that Christ has placed within
[1:13:20] you? It couldn't be because there's no
[1:13:22] struggle in him.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; So the struggle has to be in the soul,
[1:13:25] the mind,
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; the will,
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; and the emotions.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Either God's trying to get you to do
[1:13:32] something that you don't want to do, and
[1:13:34] that will is that stubborn will is
[1:13:35] kicking in, or your mind is lying to
[1:13:38] you.
[1:13:39] stinking thinking is getting you down
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; or you're being led by emotion.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; I tell you, I'm sick and tired of that
[1:13:47] kind of reactions. Aren't you in my
[1:13:49] life?
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; I want to I want to respond according to
[1:13:52] the word.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; All right. The next verse said, "Having
[1:13:55] your conversation honest, God is calling
[1:13:58] for total honesty in this hour. Total
[1:14:02] integrity
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; in this hour.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; No hypocrisy. having your conversation
[1:14:08] honest among the Gentiles, that whereas
[1:14:11] they speak against you as evildoers,
[1:14:14] that they may by your good works.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; We're not saved by works,
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; but we testify of salvation and faith by
[1:14:27] our works,
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; that they may know by your good works,
[1:14:31] which they shall
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; behold. It's not secret works. Amen.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; They're going to see them. And by that,
[1:14:38] may they glorify God in the day of
[1:14:43] visitation.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; And we are still living in the day of
[1:14:46] visitation for the Gentiles.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; We're still in the Gentile the closing
[1:14:51] hours of the Gentile church age.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; And so this is still a part of our day
[1:14:57] of visitation. It's time for the
[1:15:00] Gentiles to shine the good works of
[1:15:03] Jesus Christ. So that the Jews become
[1:15:06] jealous. Scripture said so.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; That they would inquire of us.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; What's this faith in you?
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; How are you able to come through these
[1:15:15] things? With the joy of the Lord.
[1:15:17] Father, thank you today that your word
[1:15:19] is more than just a written record. It
[1:15:23] is a living force
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; that is inside of the believer by the
[1:15:30] Holy Spirit. Thank you, Father, for the
[1:15:32] quickening life of your word.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Now, we are here today, minds a bit
[1:15:39] scattered by the weak. Ju just we're
[1:15:43] just honest before you, transparent
[1:15:46] before you. There have been all kinds of
[1:15:49] different things going on in everybody's
[1:15:51] life this week. But we have come today
[1:15:53] not to focus on that, not to complain
[1:15:56] about it, not to belly ache about it,
[1:15:58] but we have come today to get above it.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; And the only thing we know of that gets
[1:16:03] us above it is to be lost in you.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; So we throw ourselves right now, we
[1:16:09] throw ourselves, all that we are, we
[1:16:12] throw it on you and your mercy.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Ha. And we thank you for the
[1:16:19] transforming life that lives within the
[1:16:22] very inside of the inside of us. May it
[1:16:26] now move forward. May it move outward.
[1:16:29] May it affect
[1:16:31] and control the soul realm, the realm of
[1:16:34] mind, will, and emotion. and and may the
[1:16:37] Holy Ghost so take over in that realm
[1:16:40] that that control
[1:16:43] emanates to the body to the flesh and we
[1:16:47] pull it into submission to the inner
[1:16:50] spirit. And when we do that, we can do
[1:16:53] what Paul told us to do. We can get
[1:16:57] away. We can abstain from those things,
[1:17:01] those desires, those pulls that war
[1:17:04] against the soul. Help us. Help us,
[1:17:06] sweet Lord. Help us today. We ask these
[1:17:09] things uh in the name above every name,
[1:17:12] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:17:14] Bashim Adonai Yeshua Hamashiach. You may
[1:17:17] be seated this evening, this morning,
[1:17:19] this what will be evening in a minute or
[1:17:21] two. It's 12:15. So you you call it
[1:17:24] whatever you want to call it.
[1:17:27] We are looking today a at the vessel of
[1:17:31] public gaze.
[1:17:33] Now the vessel of misunderstanding, we
[1:17:36] move we move past it finally after
[1:17:38] several months and we understand that
[1:17:41] that was a a vessel that was dark
[1:17:45] uh particularly in a wealthy uh family.
[1:17:50] It would have been glass and it would
[1:17:51] have been colored glass and that was in
[1:17:54] darkness and it was kind of um almost
[1:17:59] deceptive in the sense that you couldn't
[1:18:01] tell very much about what was going on
[1:18:03] in the wine or even the color of the
[1:18:06] wine or the life that was bubbling in
[1:18:09] the wine because you were looking
[1:18:11] through a lens.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; And we might call that colored glass
[1:18:17] misunderstanding.
[1:18:18] And and all of God's children have to be
[1:18:22] at one time or another and sometimes
[1:18:24] more than one time.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Sometime we have to come back to that
[1:18:27] place where we are misunderstood.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; People see what we do and hear what we
[1:18:33] say and they they decide our motive and
[1:18:36] they uh they judge our motive
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; which is the only kind of judgment the
[1:18:41] Bible talks about.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Uh you know Christians like to say the
[1:18:45] Bible said don't judge. It didn't
[1:18:47] actually say it like that.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Uh that would be a sweeping statement.
[1:18:51] And uh it also tells us to judge
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; with a righteous judgment, with a
[1:18:56] spiritual judgment. Amen. But what Jesus
[1:18:59] said in Matthew 7 is uh if you look at
[1:19:02] that in the original language, you'll
[1:19:04] find out he says you you are not to
[1:19:06] judge motives
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; for what you see
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; or what you hear. And that's where we
[1:19:13] struggle
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; because we hear somebody say something
[1:19:16] we say I know why she said that.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Well, when you start entering into that
[1:19:22] I know why a place you have ventured
[1:19:26] into that assumption
[1:19:29] of knowing someone's intention and
[1:19:32] motive.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; And you may or may not know. And if you
[1:19:36] do know, you're still not allowed to
[1:19:38] call it out. The reason is that is
[1:19:41] reserved for God the creator. He alone
[1:19:44] sees the the intents.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; The word of God discerns and knows even
[1:19:50] the secret thoughts and the intents the
[1:19:53] intentions of the heart. You and I, if
[1:19:56] we judge not according to the spirit,
[1:19:59] but if we judge in the natural, we judge
[1:20:02] by what we hear, by what we say, by what
[1:20:04] we perceive, by what we understand. And
[1:20:07] all of that is based on how we were
[1:20:09] raised,
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; what kind of family environment we've
[1:20:12] created. Come on.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; And so it's prejudice.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; We're prejudiced toward one another
[1:20:19] based on our own bias.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; And so that misunderstanding, that's a
[1:20:24] that's a tough place to be because you
[1:20:26] want to jump up on the a chair or the
[1:20:29] couch and you want to beat your chest
[1:20:30] like a gorilla and you want to say,
[1:20:32] "Hey, listen to me. That is not what I
[1:20:35] meant."
[1:20:36] But but if you do that, uh you're going
[1:20:39] to mess your balance up
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; spiritually
[1:20:44] because you the one thing you're not
[1:20:46] allowed to do in a moment like that is
[1:20:48] defend your way out of the trial.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; You got to live your way out.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Sounds like work. It is.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; But eternity is worth the work.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; We don't have to work to get saved,
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; but to be wine in his cup. Come on now.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To be trusted with the full
[1:21:08] manifestation of the creative spoken
[1:21:10] word of God,
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; we're going to have to pass the test.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; And that means not defending ourselves.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; And and and and and it's particularly
[1:21:21] hard when you know it's a
[1:21:23] misunderstanding and you know you could
[1:21:24] solve it.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Now, you can try if you got the right
[1:21:28] spirit. You can say, you know, brother,
[1:21:30] that's not what I meant.
[1:21:32] Oh, I know what you meant. See, it just
[1:21:36] becomes a snowball.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; The best thing to do is live
[1:21:39] differently. Learn from this moment and
[1:21:42] do everything you can to to not be
[1:21:44] sliming around in the shadows.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Get on out there in the in the real
[1:21:49] world and live this life for Jesus
[1:21:52] Christ. Uh, quit trying to veil
[1:21:54] everything with a cloak of secrecy
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; because I want you to know demons
[1:21:58] multiply in a in a place that we keep
[1:22:02] hiding.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; You know, the only way to get rid of the
[1:22:07] pests is to shine the light on them.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; How many of you know they scatter? Then
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Sister Flo was talking about the
[1:22:15] roaches. Well, I don't like to think
[1:22:16] about them
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; cuz we just had some kind of crazy thing
[1:22:20] happen uh uh with some shingles that
[1:22:23] came to our house for a new roof. And
[1:22:25] we're not talking about dozens, we're
[1:22:27] talking about thousands.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; And and I've never seen anything like it
[1:22:31] on the fig tree. And I and I was
[1:22:33] beginning to see too many in the house.
[1:22:36] And we just had to have a major major
[1:22:38] major uh you know uh I don't know what
[1:22:42] all you call it spraying and a blowing
[1:22:44] and a dusting and a uh I don't I don't
[1:22:47] care. I don't like chemicals but I don't
[1:22:49] like roaches.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; I just took lots of baths and drank a
[1:22:54] lot of water and just tried the best I
[1:22:56] could. But praise God I don't want them
[1:22:58] things.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; You turn on the light.
[1:23:01] That's what happens when you Don't tell
[1:23:04] nobody. Don't tell nobody. Don't tell
[1:23:04] anybody. Don't tell nobody.
[1:23:07] When you live like that, I hope you can
[1:23:10] hear this.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Don't tell them about I don't want to
[1:23:13] know. I don't myself. When you create
[1:23:18] that kind of environment, you raise your
[1:23:20] children in that kind of environment.
[1:23:22] Guess what? They don't tell you
[1:23:23] everything either.
[1:23:27] and you think they're playing something
[1:23:28] innocent on the game
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; until you find their notebook
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; and you find they're drawing uh uh you
[1:23:36] know public shootings and de demonic
[1:23:39] looking creatures and
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; then you realize, hey,
[1:23:44] there's a lot more going on. But every
[1:23:46] but you've raised them in this
[1:23:47] environment of don't
[1:23:50] know.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; It's getting quiet, ain't it?
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; And when you raise them that way, you
[1:23:57] make them secretive.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be creating an
[1:24:02] environment where they can tell you as a
[1:24:03] parent everything.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; And and in order for that environment to
[1:24:08] be created, you can't respond out of the
[1:24:10] emotion.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; You got to say, "Thank you for telling
[1:24:13] me." and then you got to deal with it.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; That's honesty. That's in the light.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; That's where God's children conduct
[1:24:22] their business.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Whether it's family business or
[1:24:25] spiritual business, in the light.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, you could take some
[1:24:29] generational and iniquity curses off of
[1:24:33] your family, off of your home right now
[1:24:37] if you would make up your mind to create
[1:24:39] a transparent environment. Yes.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Just tell it.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; And and when you've got when you've got
[1:24:50] one member of a household triangulating
[1:24:52] by saying to someone else in the
[1:24:53] household, now I need you to tell them
[1:24:55] that I said so and so or I need you to
[1:24:57] make sure that when you explain it, you
[1:24:59] you you tell it like I have told it.
[1:25:02] Folks, that's not honest.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; That's not walking circumspectly before
[1:25:07] the Lord. That's not walking in
[1:25:09] integrity. Come on. Come on.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; We're talking about letting your yay be
[1:25:13] yay and your nay be nay.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; And what does it matter? I don't want
[1:25:18] everybody knowing my business. Well,
[1:25:20] they don't have to know your bill paying
[1:25:21] business.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; But they need to know sometime that
[1:25:26] you're in a struggle
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; and you're fighting your way through.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; And if you're a person who's always
[1:25:33] fighting something and always in a
[1:25:35] battle, be careful. Be careful with that
[1:25:38] because it's like a wolf. It's like a
[1:25:40] boy crying wolf.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; I'm just trying to give you some wisdom,
[1:25:47] practical wisdom for this hour.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Uh you you're like somebody crying wolf.
[1:25:52] You're like Chicken Little running
[1:25:53] around. The sky is falling. The sky is
[1:25:55] falling. Or you cry wolf wolf and
[1:25:57] everybody runs out to kill the wolf and
[1:26:00] there's no wolf there because you have
[1:26:02] overexaggerated
[1:26:03] the seriousness of the trial.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; We do that sometimes.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Why are you even preaching like this?
[1:26:14] Because I get so tired of hearing the
[1:26:16] same sermon all the time about how God
[1:26:19] has opened the word.
[1:26:22] Because if you don't know how to live
[1:26:25] according to that word in a practical
[1:26:27] way,
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; you may know more than the
[1:26:31] denominational man,
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; but you may not be living any higher
[1:26:35] than he's living.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; God sent this word and opened it to us a
[1:26:40] generation ago so that we could take it
[1:26:43] and become it
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; and live above it
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; and above all of the circumstances of
[1:26:50] life. That's right. That's right.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; I believe that. I believe there's grace
[1:26:54] in Gan
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; for many of the plagues.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; And if there's not enough offered in
[1:27:00] Goan, just across the river there, just
[1:27:03] across the sea, there is a promised land
[1:27:06] that we can get in. There is a pavilion.
[1:27:09] There is a tabernacle. There is a
[1:27:11] sanctuary. There is a hiding place.
[1:27:13] There is a refuge. There is a secret
[1:27:15] place. There is a tent vision.
[1:27:21] There's a place to get.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; There's a place to be.
[1:27:26] And I want to be there. And I don't want
[1:27:28] to just visit there twice a week.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; I want to live there. So, we've got to
[1:27:32] learn also how to take this great
[1:27:34] revelation of the word and not be puffed
[1:27:36] up with bride pride,
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; but begin to bring it down to such a
[1:27:41] place where we can live it very
[1:27:42] practically
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; in our life with our children, with our
[1:27:46] grandchildren, with our with our church
[1:27:48] faith community.
[1:27:52] Because in an environment like that
[1:27:54] where we know when someone stumbles, we
[1:27:57] know and we go to prayer and we don't
[1:27:59] condemn and we don't judge motives and
[1:28:02] we don't put them in hell, but we begin
[1:28:04] to try to rescue them first in prayer
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; before you put your mouth on any
[1:28:08] situation as a believer.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; We go to prayer first
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; and we ask God for wisdom.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, he's got it.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; He is the ancient of days. Amen.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; He has all wisdom in his hands.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; All wisdom. And he knows how to help us.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; So, it's one thing to be in a place of
[1:28:29] misunderstanding, but that's kind of a
[1:28:31] secret place because there's a lot going
[1:28:33] on inside of you that people can't see.
[1:28:35] So, they assume to know what's going on
[1:28:39] inside of you cuz the glass is dark. But
[1:28:42] when God pours you out of it, brother,
[1:28:44] sister,
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; the next step
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; is no more darkness,
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; no more hiding behind the colored glass,
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; no more pretending to be what we're not.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Come on. the heart. Not only is your
[1:29:00] lifestyle exposed, but the very the very
[1:29:03] heart your your very heart issues
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; are exposed
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; when you're poured into the vessel of
[1:29:10] public gaze.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; In the last vessel, you are judged for
[1:29:16] what people assume and presume
[1:29:20] and speculate.
[1:29:24] But in this season,
[1:29:26] you are inspected and evaluated on
[1:29:29] what's really there.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Now you decide which you like better.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Is it better to be misunderstood
[1:29:37] or is it better to be out in the view so
[1:29:40] everybody can see what's really going on
[1:29:43] in there?
[1:29:45] You know, we need a camera to follow you
[1:29:49] to Walmart when somebody takes your
[1:29:53] parking space
[1:29:55] and you jump out and act like you lost
[1:29:57] your mind. We need that on camera cuz
[1:30:00] that's the vessel of public gaze
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; and everybody knows. And you didn't
[1:30:05] think to look over your shoulder to see
[1:30:06] if the church folks are there
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; and you just showed out.
[1:30:13] And that's that's good. Somebody say
[1:30:15] it's not good. It is good
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; because if it's in there, it needs to
[1:30:19] come out.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; And you and I have got to be sensitive
[1:30:23] enough to when that stuff comes out,
[1:30:25] then we got to go to God.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; I still got anger issues.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; I'm still prejudice.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Coach, you've you've done this. Wouldn't
[1:30:35] have happened if it hadn't been a
[1:30:36] different ethnicity uh uh to took the
[1:30:38] place, you know, the parking place. It
[1:30:40] it just had to be, you know, uh so forth
[1:30:42] and etc. Is everybody listening?
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Well, that's what I expected. Well, you
[1:30:48] know, the only thing is they just beat
[1:30:51] you to doing it. You you you've done the
[1:30:53] same.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; You've said I You can wait.
[1:30:58] You've decided that it was your turn
[1:31:00] when it wasn't your turn.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. If that person in a four-way
[1:31:04] stop didn't move fast enough for you,
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; did you motion
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; or did you shoot out?
[1:31:15] Well, anyway, it's called the vessel of
[1:31:17] public gaze.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; And if it's in there, you want it
[1:31:20] revealed. If it's a hard issue, you want
[1:31:22] it revealed because a hard issue is
[1:31:24] going to keep us from being completely
[1:31:26] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:31:31] Or you can have a portion. Brother Bam
[1:31:33] talks about it. You can have a portion.
[1:31:35] You can even get it on your flesh.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; You can get the Holy Ghost on the on the
[1:31:40] middle part of who you are. Uh most
[1:31:43] around this message call it your spirit.
[1:31:45] We call it according to the scripture
[1:31:47] your soul. But remember it's not what
[1:31:49] you call it. It's knowing how it
[1:31:52] functions. Amen.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; And you get that, you get that uh
[1:31:57] situation going, the mind, will, and the
[1:31:59] emotion, you need all the Holy Ghost you
[1:32:01] can get on that
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; so you can get it on your soul.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; And that can be very temporary. But when
[1:32:07] it's in that spirit,
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; then the spirit turns around, that
[1:32:11] regenerated spirit in Jesus Christ, it
[1:32:14] now re it turns around and and starts
[1:32:16] leading the rest of who you are
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; into God.
[1:32:22] And you're all right. You're you you're
[1:32:24] all right until that soul kicks in
[1:32:26] again. And and that's why we have to
[1:32:28] feed our spirit,
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; the inside of the inside more than we
[1:32:32] feed our soul,
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; mind, will, and emotion.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that feeds the spirit,
[1:32:37] man, like the atmosphere of worship and
[1:32:39] the reality of the word of God.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Everything else, not necessarily sin,
[1:32:46] but everything else generally appeals to
[1:32:48] either the soul or the flesh. it makes
[1:32:51] us emotionally uh lifted or so forth and
[1:32:54] etc. And uh that can last for a very
[1:32:58] short amount of time. But there's a joy
[1:33:00] that gets down on the inside of the
[1:33:02] inside of the inside. No matter what you
[1:33:04] call it, whatever that compartment is,
[1:33:06] there's a joy that gets down in there.
[1:33:08] Hallelujah.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; And see, depression is always in the
[1:33:12] middle ground. I got to hurry.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Depression is always in the middle
[1:33:16] ground. It always operates mind, will,
[1:33:18] and emotion.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; That's right. And you know what it's
[1:33:21] trying to do? It's trying to pull the
[1:33:23] spirit down. Well, why would it do that?
[1:33:25] Because it's in the process of full
[1:33:27] sanctification.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; I know if you go to the Baptist church,
[1:33:32] they tell you it's all done at one time.
[1:33:35] But I've been living this thing 50 years
[1:33:37] now nearly, and it ain't all taken care
[1:33:40] of at one time.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; This is a process. I'm still, you know
[1:33:44] what? I'm still kicking things out.
[1:33:47] Yes,
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; I'm still telling things to get out of
[1:33:50] here. Debt, debt, debt.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; That's not who I am in Christ.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; I refuse to be a slave
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; to somebody else's prejudice.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; I refuse to be a slave to somebody
[1:34:03] else's family mess.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes people want to tell,
[1:34:09] well, that's how we do it in my house. I
[1:34:11] want to ask you a question. How's it
[1:34:12] working?
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Is it working? If it's working, keep
[1:34:15] doing it. If it's not working, you might
[1:34:17] ought to come back to the word and do it
[1:34:19] the word way
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; because we have a promise if we do it
[1:34:23] the word way.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; If you look at that promise in the
[1:34:27] original
[1:34:29] in the King James, it just simply says,
[1:34:31] you know, train a child, raise a child
[1:34:34] in the way he should go and and and when
[1:34:37] he is old,
[1:34:39] he'll not depart. Something along those
[1:34:41] lines.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; But in the original, it actually says
[1:34:44] something like this. And while they are
[1:34:46] growing old,
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; you know that's everybody in the room.
[1:34:52] Did you know they're grow? Did you know
[1:34:54] that uh Abel Joshua is growing old?
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; And he just born
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; because after birth from there on
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; I don't want to depress anybody.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; But it's that process.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; It doesn't wait till you're three to
[1:35:10] start or 30 to start. It starts
[1:35:12] immediately.
[1:35:14] things start moving in that direction
[1:35:16] and and may God give every one of you
[1:35:18] and and everybody you know a long life
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; but the reality is because it's really
[1:35:25] the way the creator designed us dying
[1:35:28] all the time and thank God for the ones
[1:35:30] that are able to reproduce
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; healthy cells
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; otherwise they reproduce the wrong kind
[1:35:36] of cells the ones that are already
[1:35:37] mutated by disease and cancer we want
[1:35:40] holy holy fresh ripe you So well whole
[1:35:44] helpselves
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; now while he is growing old he will not
[1:35:49] depart from it. That's a promise you
[1:35:51] ought to hold on to.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; I I I would say you ought to start on
[1:35:57] that journey now if you haven't already
[1:35:59] by by training them. And training them
[1:36:01] is not just teaching them. Teaching them
[1:36:04] is sitting them down and telling them
[1:36:06] how it is.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; That's teaching.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:12] That doesn't have a whole lot of impact
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; with every mind
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; because children learn different, listen
[1:36:19] different,
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; and if they're caught up in this hour,
[1:36:23] their attention span is less than 30
[1:36:25] seconds.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; That's your dumb phone did it.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; And so you got to find So the best way
[1:36:35] is not just tell them how it ought to be
[1:36:37] done. Show them.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you're whipping your
[1:36:41] children and not telling them why
[1:36:42] they're being disciplined,
[1:36:45] you're actually instilling an anger in
[1:36:47] them that they're going to have to deal
[1:36:48] with the rest of their life.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; But if you'll explain to them, not at
[1:36:52] your convenience,
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; but at that moment,
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; you'll begin to explain to them what
[1:36:58] God's word said and why you're being
[1:37:01] punished. Do you understand why you're
[1:37:03] being punished? Tell me why you're being
[1:37:06] punished.
[1:37:08] you tell me back. Then one or two things
[1:37:11] is going to happen. The need for the
[1:37:14] actual corporal punishment may not even
[1:37:15] be there anymore because you may see a
[1:37:17] light come on.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be glorious?
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; I don't care what age the child. You may
[1:37:23] see a light come on.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean you'll never have to say it
[1:37:26] again, but it means you opened a door.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. you you opened a door and
[1:37:33] that door is worth opening and keeping
[1:37:35] open
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; because I'm telling you, Satan, one of
[1:37:38] the things that came out in those
[1:37:40] visions that we've been going over
[1:37:41] privately, all all of us at Benjamin's
[1:37:44] uh uh request, he said, I think we
[1:37:46] should revisit them and and uh and and I
[1:37:49] hope that you've been doing that. I've
[1:37:51] been doing it myself. And one of the
[1:37:53] things that has stood out to me was one
[1:37:55] of the commissions that God had given us
[1:37:57] was to build stronger families. Yes.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Well, if you try to preach something or
[1:38:05] teach something that builds stronger
[1:38:07] families, you've got to wade through
[1:38:09] everybody's opinion to get there.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; And and then you got to deal with that
[1:38:14] backlash. Well, I know for a fact,
[1:38:16] Brother Shelley didn't always do it that
[1:38:17] way. I know for a fact you were right.
[1:38:23] There are times that my wife and I sit
[1:38:25] like old people in chairs and weep
[1:38:28] together
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; because we realized we made mistakes.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; And we realize how long ago? Um 10 days.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; No more than two weeks since the last
[1:38:42] time. It becomes overwhelming when you
[1:38:45] realize you you you've missed that
[1:38:48] opportunity
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; and now you've got to approach it from
[1:38:51] an entirely different way.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; You don't have necessarily a dependent
[1:38:56] anymore.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Now you've got an adult.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; And it's an entirely different thing. I
[1:39:02] beg you, I implore you, I plead with you
[1:39:06] in the name of Jesus Christ, if you've
[1:39:08] got small children, don't miss your
[1:39:11] opportunity now. Don't miss it now to
[1:39:15] instill everything you can get in them
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; while you have an opportunity. And may I
[1:39:21] suggest that some of you take on the
[1:39:23] biblical responsibility of training your
[1:39:26] children at home?
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; It's going to get quiet now.
[1:39:34] I can't find anywhere in God's word
[1:39:37] where God told the Israelites, "Get out
[1:39:39] of Egypt."
[1:39:41] And they get out there in the desert
[1:39:43] somewhere. And and the next morning or a
[1:39:45] few mornings later, they get all their
[1:39:47] children up, wash their faces, and dress
[1:39:49] them and send them back to Egypt
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; to be trained how to live a godly life.
[1:40:02] It's a huge responsibility.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; And somebody said, "Well, let's let them
[1:40:06] find their way on their own." Get out of
[1:40:08] here, you wrong world view. You
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; don't you come in here saying, "Let them
[1:40:14] find out on their own."
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; The Bible didn't say, "Let everybody
[1:40:17] find out the hard way."
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible tells us, "Set the
[1:40:21] example for one another and do it right.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; And when you fail, tell them.
[1:40:30] I blew it.
[1:40:32] I absolutely blew it.
[1:40:37] And wait till one of your children says,
[1:40:39] "You want me to pray for you, Daddy?"
[1:40:42] You better say, "Absolutely.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. We need it. We're in this
[1:40:47] thing together.
[1:40:48] I I don't know who that was for, but uh
[1:40:51] the rest of you don't shovel it over
[1:40:53] your your your shoulder
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; because this is the I'm telling you,
[1:40:57] this is the hour. This is actually the
[1:40:59] most important generation
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; perhaps that there that there's ever
[1:41:03] been.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; It is more important than the 50s and
[1:41:06] 60s.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; And I know that's hard for some folks
[1:41:09] around the message to say, but it is.
[1:41:11] It's much more important because the
[1:41:13] word that God delivered in that
[1:41:15] generation is more precious and more
[1:41:18] applicable even to the day and hour
[1:41:20] we're living in right now than it ever
[1:41:22] was. And if it's ever going to produce
[1:41:24] the life of Christ, it has to do it now.
[1:41:28] If there's ever going to be overcoming
[1:41:30] Christians, they have to be in this
[1:41:31] hour. If there's ever going to be fully
[1:41:33] adopted sons, they've got to step up
[1:41:36] now. No.
[1:41:39] [Applause]
[1:41:42] Because perhaps you that have seen a few
[1:41:44] of your grandchildren come along, you
[1:41:46] may actually that may be it.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; They may be the last.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; They may represent the last of the
[1:41:55] generations.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; We're coming nearer and nearer to that
[1:42:00] moment of translation. Well, I've heard
[1:42:03] that all my life. Well, what are you
[1:42:04] doing about it? What did you do about it
[1:42:06] then? And what are you doing about it
[1:42:08] now? Vitally important. God will pour
[1:42:10] you into that vessel of public gaze. Uh
[1:42:13] it wasn't a colored glass. It was a
[1:42:16] shallow wide mouththed. And when these
[1:42:20] notes are finished, you can have them.
[1:42:21] And they're almost 200 pages long. Now
[1:42:25] you can you can you can have a file. I'm
[1:42:27] not printing it for you unless you you
[1:42:29] pay for it. Can you imagine print and
[1:42:32] paper if everybody said I'll take a set
[1:42:33] of those at Well, I guess I could take
[1:42:36] it down to normal
[1:42:38] font. It is a 13,
[1:42:42] so I can see it in a in a moment of
[1:42:44] glancing down. If I took that down to
[1:42:46] like a book or novel or something, I
[1:42:48] might could get it in 50 pages or so.
[1:42:50] Who knows? It's a shallow, wide-mouthed
[1:42:54] fermentation vessel made from various
[1:42:57] materials including clay, stone,
[1:43:01] concrete, or even glass. In modern
[1:43:04] times, that shallow, wide-mouthed, open
[1:43:08] vessel is generally made out of
[1:43:11] stainless steel.
[1:43:13] The wide shallow design, and we're
[1:43:16] talking about shallow like this in Bible
[1:43:18] days. It would be deeper, I'm sure, in
[1:43:21] modern stainless steel. The wide shallow
[1:43:24] design ensured both even and balanced
[1:43:28] fermentation.
[1:43:29] If you're going to learn balance, learn
[1:43:31] it in the vessel of public gaze.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; While everybody's looking, get your
[1:43:37] balance and keep it.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; So you can you can put away some of your
[1:43:42] brandisms.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; You don't always have to wear the
[1:43:47] costume. Right?
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; You don't always have to have on a
[1:43:50] cowboy hat and a bolo tie and a big
[1:43:52] eagle belt buckle.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; You can if you like, but you don't
[1:43:56] always have to do that because we're not
[1:43:59] patterning after a man.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; We're patterning after the word.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; The God that was in him is what I'm
[1:44:06] following.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; The word that came out of him from
[1:44:08] heaven is what I'm agreeing with.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; The man was flawed. The vessel was
[1:44:14] flawed. And if he wasn't, then he was
[1:44:17] never of this world.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; Because Moses was flawed
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; and Noah was flawed and the apostles
[1:44:25] were flawed.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; He was a sinner saved by grace, highly
[1:44:30] favored, chosen, and called of God.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; He didn't come so we would walk like him
[1:44:35] and talk like him and dress like him. He
[1:44:38] didn't come so that all that would come
[1:44:39] out of our mouth. As brother Bram said,
[1:44:41] Brother Bram said, Brother Bram said,
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; he came so that we could get a hold of
[1:44:45] this word, we could eat it
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; and digest it and unpack it until we
[1:44:51] become it.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; The living word.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; That's the trans that's the
[1:44:58] transformation that has to take place in
[1:45:00] this hour.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; And the only way I know is to spend
[1:45:04] enough time
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; in that pavilion. Amen.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; In that secret place,
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; there was a generation ago that didn't
[1:45:11] know anything about this message that
[1:45:13] started preaching the the truths of the
[1:45:15] inner place, that secret place, getting
[1:45:17] lost in God, getting away in God. And
[1:45:20] they didn't understand and realize that
[1:45:22] at the at the very same time, there was
[1:45:24] an adoption and a sunship message that
[1:45:27] was being preached. And God was tying
[1:45:29] together all the loose ends of the other
[1:45:31] church ages in such a beautiful way. and
[1:45:34] that to to to understand the secret
[1:45:36] place fully, you would have to
[1:45:39] understand the the structure that that
[1:45:42] message was bringing.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; And so you've got you had people running
[1:45:46] ahead in certain areas
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; and missing the whole thing.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; And so and so then I know people who
[1:45:55] came to the message and the first thing
[1:45:57] they did is they burned everybody else's
[1:45:59] tapes and they threw everybody else's
[1:46:00] books away.
[1:46:06] Somebody ought known right then
[1:46:09] something wasn't right.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; I I'll just be completely honest with
[1:46:12] you. Somebody ought said to you, "Maybe
[1:46:15] you need a doctor."
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Because if that is truth, you can judge
[1:46:22] all other things by that truth. Right.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; But to think that there's no truth
[1:46:28] anywhere else and never was
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; is a contradiction of that message.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Because in every church age,
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:46:38] And so what happened is we came to a
[1:46:40] greater truth and a higher truth and
[1:46:42] embraced it and moved forward and and
[1:46:44] and missed
[1:46:47] a whole lot of what God was revealing in
[1:46:49] other places during that time to help us
[1:46:52] understand the value
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; of only you and him
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; in the bridal chamber.
[1:47:02] Had we had we pulled a little of that
[1:47:04] for forward with us
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; and and then took this great truth that
[1:47:08] changed us and looked back and said my
[1:47:11] my my with this with Christ the word
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; if I go in the secret place with Christ
[1:47:19] the word this must produce a change.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Come on. But instead, we had to. Anyway,
[1:47:27] you know how we had to do. You know how
[1:47:29] we did. God help us. We're paying the
[1:47:32] price. We're still here on the earth
[1:47:35] paying the price.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; When a prophet said 50 plus years ago,
[1:47:40] the rapture is overdue. If it was
[1:47:42] overdue 50 years ago, how how overdue do
[1:47:45] you think it is now?
[1:47:50] And that's why we have to wade through
[1:47:52] the manmade doctrines that have been
[1:47:55] formed by the followers of a message.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Have nothing to do with the message and
[1:48:00] they have nothing to do with the word.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; It's someone's version and
[1:48:05] interpretation. We got to take it right
[1:48:08] back to the word and become that. Get
[1:48:10] locked in that place.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Not coming out.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; I told Benjamin a couple days this week,
[1:48:15] I'm not answering. I'm not going to take
[1:48:17] the text. Shut my door. If you're
[1:48:19] leaving, shut my door. And unless the
[1:48:22] building is on fire or somebody's dying,
[1:48:26] I have got to have a few moments with
[1:48:29] him.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; You'll never be able to help your own
[1:48:33] family. You'll never be able to help
[1:48:35] your coworker. You'll never be able to
[1:48:37] help your church friends and family if
[1:48:39] you don't take time
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; with him.
[1:48:45] And and I want to tell you something. We
[1:48:47] think we got to have that thing in our
[1:48:49] hand all the time. We absolutely do not.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; And and somebody said, "Well, you know
[1:48:54] what? If somebody needs you, what if
[1:48:56] there's an emergency?" Let me tell you
[1:48:57] something. The worst thing that could
[1:48:59] happen if you needed me in an emergency
[1:49:01] and I didn't have my phone with me. The
[1:49:03] worst thing that can happen is you would
[1:49:05] have to fall on your face
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; and pray for yourself.
[1:49:12] Come on.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; You You see, it wasn't about getting
[1:49:17] people to a prophet.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; And it's today, it's not about getting
[1:49:21] people to a pastor.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; It's about coming to Christ
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; and making sure there are no dead cats
[1:49:31] on the line.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't wait until there's
[1:49:36] no problem in your life to get the line
[1:49:38] clear. get it all clear right now so
[1:49:41] that when the problem comes
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; and I look I want to it it would worry
[1:49:47] me to death. It would torment me. It
[1:49:48] would bother me. It would upset me. I
[1:49:51] was an hour late answering a text about
[1:49:53] the baby in the middle of the night and
[1:49:56] it worried me. I felt guilty. How could
[1:49:59] I have dozed back off? I had been up. I
[1:50:02] had been praying. How could I have dozed
[1:50:04] back off and missed that they were
[1:50:06] reaching out for me? And I felt
[1:50:08] terrible. So, I'm not trying to be cold
[1:50:09] and callous and make you think I won't
[1:50:11] wouldn't care. I care.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; But I want you to know if he answers.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; I don't need no credit anyhow.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; If he steps up and helps you in that
[1:50:22] moment, then guess what? You'll be
[1:50:23] reaching out with a testimony.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; And you'll say, "Pastor, you know, I I I
[1:50:28] felt bad that I couldn't get you, but I
[1:50:31] just called on the Lord.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; He came and sat in the automobile with
[1:50:35] me and helped me. Hallelujah. He will.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Get a hold of him.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Woo. He He Central's never busy. He's
[1:50:47] always on the line.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; You can talk to heaven anytime.
[1:50:52] Is a a royal service free for one and
[1:50:55] all. When you get in trouble, give this
[1:50:58] royal line a call. Telephone to glory.
[1:51:03] Oh, what joy divine. telephone to go. I
[1:51:07] can feel the current moving on the line
[1:51:10] built by God the father for his loved
[1:51:13] and own. You can talk to Jesus.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; You can talk to heaven on this royal
[1:51:20] telephone.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; How many of you are thankful for the
[1:51:22] power of prayer?
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; This wide shallow is about balance in
[1:51:31] the fermentation. Don't get off
[1:51:34] anywhere. Don't get to leaning too heavy
[1:51:36] on your understanding.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Lean on revelation and revelation is
[1:51:40] always rooted in scripture.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; It's very important that we keep our
[1:51:45] balance in all things. And there's
[1:51:47] nothing to help us get there like
[1:51:48] everybody looking at us.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Get the balance. Keep your emotions
[1:51:54] intact the best you can. If you're down,
[1:51:57] you don't want everybody in the world to
[1:51:58] be down.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. Do you really do you
[1:52:02] really want to pull somebody else down?
[1:52:04] If you're down
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; and then you're both down.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; How does that feel?
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Not too good.
[1:52:11] The best marriage you can have is to
[1:52:12] have one that's up and one that's down
[1:52:14] and and swap if they have to and finally
[1:52:17] come to a place where they're always
[1:52:18] fighting their way up
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; and giving God praise in the midst of
[1:52:23] the trial.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Don't mean that problems don't come, but
[1:52:27] it means that we have control over that
[1:52:29] middle ground.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; We keep pulling it up.
[1:52:34] I went through something like that this
[1:52:35] week. Didn't say anything to anybody.
[1:52:37] I'm sure they knew.
[1:52:39] I'm I'm sure they did because the one
[1:52:41] thing I struggle with is the grumps when
[1:52:44] I'm when I'm fighting that emotions,
[1:52:45] those emotions of of depression or
[1:52:47] whatever it is, whatever you would call
[1:52:49] it. Uh I I tend to be grumpy and I tend
[1:52:52] to think that people ought to know what
[1:52:53] I mean instead of what I say. The very
[1:52:55] thing I preach against, you're not
[1:52:57] supposed to judge what I mean.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to know what I say, you
[1:53:00] know. And uh but I want you to know when
[1:53:03] the victory came, I reported it.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; I said to my children, I I hadn't said
[1:53:08] it the words out. I hadn't spoke it out.
[1:53:10] What I'd gone through, I I'm sure they
[1:53:12] knew it was something. But when the
[1:53:13] victory came, I said, I think it was to
[1:53:15] the girls in the room, I I got it today.
[1:53:17] I found the place today. And you know
[1:53:20] how I did it? Behind the door, "Shut the
[1:53:22] door. Shut the door."
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Why in that room? Why
[1:53:28] over there? Hadn't we been having a
[1:53:30] glorious uh uh prayer line up here? Why
[1:53:34] why do we have to go in that little
[1:53:35] room? And the Lord spoke and said, "When
[1:53:38] thou doest thine arms,
[1:53:40] you enter into that secret place
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; and close the door." That's what the
[1:53:45] Lord said. And he understood that that's
[1:53:48] where the answer's found.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; That's where the change is found.
[1:53:53] like that old Sunday school
[1:53:54] superintendent of my granny's
[1:53:57] when she said that day before she heard
[1:54:00] the word and stepped down. Let's make
[1:54:01] sure that we clarify that because that's
[1:54:04] one of the rumors that's been going
[1:54:06] around again that I was exonerating a
[1:54:08] woman preacher. Well, I tell you, she
[1:54:11] did live a godly life and she should be
[1:54:13] mentioned with respect and she must have
[1:54:16] belonged to God
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; because when the when the answer came,
[1:54:20] the truth came, she said, "You mean to
[1:54:21] tell me it wasn't even my
[1:54:22] responsibility?" And she stepped down
[1:54:24] from doing what she had done her whole
[1:54:26] life to honor the word.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; So, I'm not trying to exonerate her. I'm
[1:54:31] just telling you stories of my own life.
[1:54:33] She she said one morning, if you don't
[1:54:35] have the Holy Ghost, she said, "You
[1:54:37] don't have no business having some kind
[1:54:39] of authority or office in anything,
[1:54:41] particularly the church."
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; She said, "Here come the Sunday school
[1:54:47] superintendent after the service and
[1:54:48] slammed his record books down on the
[1:54:50] desk and said, "I quit."
[1:54:54] And she said, "Why, brother, what in the
[1:54:55] world has come over you?" He said, "You
[1:54:57] said that if I didn't have the Holy
[1:54:59] Ghost, I I didn't have no business hold.
[1:55:02] I don't know whether I have the Holy
[1:55:03] Ghost or not. She said, "You don't
[1:55:07] because she understood
[1:55:09] that if you do, you know you do."
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible said.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; You'll know you're saved
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; by the quickening in your spirit.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; If that's the case, you're definitely
[1:55:22] going to know when the Holy Ghost
[1:55:24] abides.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; And if he doesn't, assume the worst and
[1:55:27] pray.
[1:55:29] I know that's not how they preach it.
[1:55:31] That's how I preach it.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; I preach it. Assume the worst and pray
[1:55:34] till you know.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; And they say, "Well, just hold on in
[1:55:37] faith and and and you know, just keep
[1:55:39] amen in the word and believe the
[1:55:40] prophet."
[1:55:44] Well, since the devil believes,
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; not doing him any good, you make sure
[1:55:50] you've got the Holy Ghost.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; If I'm wrong preaching to you to make
[1:55:54] sure that you have the baptism of the
[1:55:57] Holy Ghost, I won't mind answering to
[1:55:59] God for that over there. Amen.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm preaching. Make sure you
[1:56:02] got it. She said, "Why, brother, don't
[1:56:04] quit.
[1:56:06] Don't quit. You go make sure you got
[1:56:09] it."
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; And when you do, the books are there.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; She said, "I don't I didn't think I'd
[1:56:13] see him ever again." Probably because he
[1:56:15] already was a little off fly off the
[1:56:17] handle pretty quick.
[1:56:21] Did he really?
[1:56:23] Oh, but she said that night we got back
[1:56:24] to church and we were in pre-ervice
[1:56:26] prayer and I was down in the altar
[1:56:28] praying and there were several in the
[1:56:30] altar praying and she said, "I heard the
[1:56:32] door slam and I thought, uhoh, what in
[1:56:34] the world's happening?" She said, "I
[1:56:35] just I just kept my eyes closed like
[1:56:37] that." And she said, "I heard somebody
[1:56:39] walking down the middle aisle of the
[1:56:41] church with the most purposeful heavy
[1:56:43] steps I'd heard in a long, long time."
[1:56:45] And he come up and said, "A hand come on
[1:56:47] my shoulder and shook me right in the
[1:56:49] altar praying." I turn around, it was
[1:56:51] him.
[1:56:52] He said, "Oh, Sister Shelly, I did what
[1:56:56] you said."
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; She said, "He didn't have to convince
[1:57:03] me. I saw it and I could feel it." She
[1:57:06] said, "His whole countenance changed."
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; She said, "I'd never seen him glowing
[1:57:11] like that." She said, "Well, what
[1:57:13] happened, brother?" She said, he said,
[1:57:14] "I took my family home for lunch,
[1:57:17] dropped them off at the house so that
[1:57:19] they could have lunch. I said to my
[1:57:21] wife, "I'm not eating lunch. I'm not
[1:57:23] eating supper.
[1:57:24] [Applause]
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; I won't be eating breakfast.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; I don't know when I'll eat again. But
[1:57:31] I'm going to the Pine Thicket and I'm
[1:57:34] not coming out."
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; If you know anything about this message,
[1:57:38] you'll know that's pretty much how the
[1:57:40] prophet said it.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; He did the same. Here's me. Here's the
[1:57:45] cash I have. Here's the money I have.
[1:57:48] and I you'll see me if I if I come back
[1:57:50] at all. You know that kind of an
[1:57:52] attitude. I'm going out there and I'm
[1:57:54] not coming back until I've heard from
[1:57:56] him. He said, "I dropped my wife off and
[1:57:58] my wife was worried and she was saying,
[1:58:00] "Oh, honey, you got to eat." Blah blah
[1:58:02] blah. And he said, "I couldn't help it.
[1:58:06] I wasn't trying to make no show in front
[1:58:07] of my family, but I found the pine
[1:58:09] thicket. I parked the car on the side of
[1:58:11] the road. I went right up in the middle
[1:58:12] of those pine trees. I saw a log land. I
[1:58:15] I fell down on my knees and made that an
[1:58:18] altar. And I prayed and I prayed and I
[1:58:21] prayed and the first hour I was I was
[1:58:24] having to get through being mad.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Then I had to forgive Sister Shelly.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Then I had to get over the fact that
[1:58:37] nobody had ever told me till now.
[1:58:40] Well, that's cuz he acted like he had
[1:58:42] it.
[1:58:43] Yeah, you got it.
[1:58:45] But when you when you were elected to
[1:58:47] that office,
[1:58:49] you should have never took the office
[1:58:51] without knowing.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; But he said, "I prayed through all that,
[1:58:55] too." And he just said, "I just Lord, I
[1:58:58] I'm going to I I I'm literally going to
[1:59:01] just be right here."
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I don't even know for sure
[1:59:05] I mean it the first few times I said
[1:59:06] it."
[1:59:08] It sounded like the right thing to say.
[1:59:10] I've done said it to my family. I might
[1:59:11] as well say it to the Lord. But he said
[1:59:13] there was something inside of me. He
[1:59:14] said, 'Oh, you'll be hungry about supper
[1:59:15] time. Oh, but he said, I kept to praying
[1:59:19] until I got to a place where I meant it.
[1:59:22] And I said, they can find my bones. I
[1:59:25] don't care. They can find what's left of
[1:59:27] me, but I'm not leaving here until
[1:59:29] heaven comes down and glory fills my
[1:59:32] soul. And he fills me with a walking,
[1:59:34] talking Holy Ghost. And he's testifying
[1:59:36] to Granny. She's still in the altar.
[1:59:37] Turn around, listen to him. And he said
[1:59:39] he did. Glory be to God.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; And she said, "You ought to have seen
[1:59:47] the revival that broke out. Service that
[1:59:49] night was like a revival." And somebody
[1:59:50] said, "Let's come to church tomorrow
[1:59:52] night." And she said, "That's how it
[1:59:54] started." Listen, folks, if everybody
[1:59:56] would get that desperate in this late
[1:59:58] hour to have the Holy Ghost,
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; that you would lay around somewhere
[2:00:04] before the Lord until he filled you. I'm
[2:00:08] telling you, you'd get up and you'd love
[2:00:10] the one that you're struggling to love.
[2:00:12] Now,
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; you see, we could accept, folks, you can
[2:00:18] accept someone's apology.
[2:00:21] It's easy.
[2:00:23] Sure, we usually say something stupid
[2:00:27] like, "No problem.
[2:00:30] There was a problem." and somebody's
[2:00:33] trying to make it right
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; and you know it bothered you and you
[2:00:38] know it hurt you and you know you
[2:00:40] suffered because of it so they come to
[2:00:43] apologize you oh it didn't bother me I'm
[2:00:44] I'm all right it's okay don't worry
[2:00:46] about it now do you think that sets up a
[2:00:49] new do you think that puts everything on
[2:00:51] a new day and and everybody just goes
[2:00:53] upward from there no
[2:00:56] because it's based on a foundation of
[2:00:59] dishonesty
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; it did hurt Why don't you just say,
[2:01:02] "Well, it really hurt me at the time. I
[2:01:05] might not have been prayed up enough,
[2:01:07] but but regardless, I don't know. But it
[2:01:09] really really hurt me, and I would be
[2:01:12] over it by now
[2:01:16] had I just really given it to the Lord.
[2:01:20] And you would have been over it by now
[2:01:23] had you made a change in your life,
[2:01:26] and we'd be moving on. But this is the
[2:01:29] start. Let's call this the start. And
[2:01:32] we're not only going to say, "I forgive
[2:01:34] you because you did bother me. You did
[2:01:37] hurt me,
[2:01:40] but I I'm going to forgive you, but now
[2:01:41] we're going to build from here on out.
[2:01:43] And and let there be a change in me that
[2:01:46] I don't hold it anymore. But let there
[2:01:48] be a change in you." That's a prayer.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; If you start telling them that, they'll
[2:01:53] ruin.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; But cry out to God. Let there be a
[2:01:57] change in them. Because if you'll change
[2:01:58] your life, then that's real repentance.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; If you mope around still and want
[2:02:05] somebody to feel sorry for you as though
[2:02:07] you're the victim
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; when you're the one who did it,
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; you've not had a change.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; That's no change.
[2:02:18] We've got to if Look, folks, I send
[2:02:21] folks the other way when someone comes
[2:02:23] to me with a if I've done anything.
[2:02:26] If you don't know,
[2:02:30] it's not a repentance.
[2:02:32] I I mean, we got to grow up now. Woo!
[2:02:35] It's quiet. Got to go. Got to hurry.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; We got to grow up.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; You You may not be completely sure, but
[2:02:42] if is not a good way to lead,
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; especially if that person is still raw
[2:02:50] and you come up saying, "If
[2:02:52] no, don't do that. I know I must have
[2:02:56] done something because sometimes you you
[2:03:00] really know what you did.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; If we would start off honest without
[2:03:08] hypocrisy in trying to make something
[2:03:12] work, God would honor that.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; He doesn't honor a lack of integrity.
[2:03:17] Right?
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; He don't honor somebody who goes around
[2:03:21] behind your back saying, "Well, I I you
[2:03:23] know, I I owned up to it, but it really
[2:03:25] wasn't all that much.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; That's not real repentance. You didn't
[2:03:29] have a real change. You immediately
[2:03:31] tried to start rebuilding your
[2:03:33] reputation." And God, I tell you, that
[2:03:36] stinks in his nostrils.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; It's better to say, "I was wrong."
[2:03:40] brother uh whoever Lee Veil in the
[2:03:43] church age book said
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; that there's a great need in this hour
[2:03:49] for screaming out I was wrong.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; It you know we could just kind of make
[2:03:55] that our theme sometime because we're so
[2:03:57] good at shifting blame in this hour. I I
[2:04:00] me
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; I was wrong. God have mercy on me. I
[2:04:08] blew it. I'm telling you, God says,
[2:04:10] "Wow, that's my boy. That's my girl."
[2:04:14] Because when we can be honest with
[2:04:16] ourselves, God sees that as an open door
[2:04:19] to come and mold us.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Well, I'll just tell
[2:04:31] you what. I'm giving you an out now
[2:04:34] because one way or the other, we're
[2:04:36] going to come to that place. And it may
[2:04:38] be the public gaze vessel. Although I
[2:04:40] know some folks who spend some time in
[2:04:42] that public gaze vessel and they came
[2:04:44] out the same way they went in. And you
[2:04:46] know what that tells me?
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; It tells me another another trip around
[2:04:51] the mountain.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; I could call names in this house.
[2:04:59] You've got another trip around the
[2:05:01] mountain coming.
[2:05:04] You can to decide today to be real,
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; to take off the facade,
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; to quit being phony
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; and be genuine.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Ghost in you is
[2:05:18] genuine.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; God is genuine. The word is genuine.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; And when we try to repair what people
[2:05:26] think about us more than we spend time
[2:05:28] trying to repent and get it right
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; for the right reason, Yes.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Then we we become a distraction more
[2:05:35] than we do become something that's going
[2:05:37] to take us forward. Lord knows I don't
[2:05:39] want to hinder nobody.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; I don't want to get hindered. And I
[2:05:42] don't want to hinder nobody else. I'm
[2:05:44] just trying to be really really real.
[2:05:47] And if I could keep you out or spare you
[2:05:50] that part of public gaze, I would
[2:05:52] because it is not comfortable. And some
[2:05:54] people with a with a certain kind of
[2:05:56] mindset work overtime when they're in
[2:05:58] that vessel to try to go around make
[2:06:00] sure that everybody's not going to
[2:06:01] really think the worst.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; And when you do that, you're defeating
[2:06:06] the whole purpose of being poured in
[2:06:07] there anyhow.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Exposure. Listen, the purpose of the
[2:06:13] vessel of public gaze is exposure. Let
[2:06:16] us all say exposure.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Sounds exciting, doesn't it? Exposure.
[2:06:28] It's like being caught skinny dipping.
[2:06:31] Did I just say that? I did.
[2:06:34] There's your blooper.
[2:06:39] You can't get much more open than that.
[2:06:41] That's a lot of exposure. More than I
[2:06:43] want to ever see.
[2:06:46] I know you feel the same way. So stay
[2:06:49] out of my backyard. I'm just kidding.
[2:06:53] Just kidding. Kind of.
[2:06:57] The wide shallow design ensured uh both
[2:07:01] even and balanced fermentation. It's
[2:07:04] also very important that we keep our
[2:07:05] balance in all things. All right.
[2:07:06] Purpose of the design exposure. This
[2:07:08] vessel was open at the top. It was
[2:07:10] purposely designed to expose the
[2:07:12] fermenting wine to oxygen and small
[2:07:16] controlled amounts of light. The vessel
[2:07:19] of misunderstanding was to give you no
[2:07:21] light
[2:07:23] because the first steps of fermentation
[2:07:25] need to take place in total darkness.
[2:07:27] The second steps of fermentation in the
[2:07:29] racking system is controlled amounts of
[2:07:32] light getting into the into the liquid
[2:07:36] and
[2:07:38] oxygen being able to get to it without a
[2:07:40] cork, without a seal.
[2:07:43] And that's a good thing, folks, because
[2:07:46] it means that the vessel uh of public
[2:07:49] gaze is shorter
[2:07:52] almost always
[2:07:54] than the vessel of misunderstanding
[2:07:56] because the the amount of light and
[2:07:59] oxygen has to be controlled or the wine
[2:08:01] will become oxidized and spoiled.
[2:08:06] If you ever find wine, maybe homemade
[2:08:09] wine for communion or something. If you
[2:08:11] if you uh see that it has spoiled, it is
[2:08:14] most likely because it was exposed to
[2:08:17] too much light or too much oxygen.
[2:08:21] If you if you were to jar it and you
[2:08:23] leave the jar lid off too long and too
[2:08:25] much oxygen gets to the wine, it's like
[2:08:29] spores in the air and it gets into that
[2:08:32] wine and it becomes over oxidized and it
[2:08:35] spoils. So, it has to be a controlled
[2:08:38] environment and God gets to pick it.
[2:08:41] He picks that place of public gaze in
[2:08:44] your life. You don't pick it.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; He picks it. It's controlled. It's for a
[2:08:49] purpose. Anybody here?
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; This little bit of oxygen further
[2:08:54] activated the fermentation process,
[2:08:57] boosting the wine's aroma and color and
[2:08:59] fragrance. It was not sealed and
[2:09:01] therefore was not meant for long-term
[2:09:03] storage. Too much time in this vessel
[2:09:05] could cause spoilage. The vessel served
[2:09:07] a brief yet highly intentional season in
[2:09:10] producing the most valuable and
[2:09:12] sought-after wine. Its design
[2:09:15] prioritized observation over pers.
[2:09:19] Unlike the sealed darkness of the vessel
[2:09:21] of misunderstanding, this vessel is open
[2:09:24] for inspection.
[2:09:31] You can fool anybody
[2:09:33] that doesn't get a good look.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; This season is about getting a good
[2:09:39] look.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; You're not going to hide from this one.
[2:09:44] This is who you are on a Monday.
[2:09:48] This is who you are. As I said, when
[2:09:50] your parking place is stolen, this is
[2:09:52] who you are when you aren't getting
[2:09:55] customer service like you like you uh
[2:09:57] deserve and you and you show out.
[2:10:02] This this is about God revealing first
[2:10:06] to you
[2:10:08] through the eyes of others
[2:10:11] the issues of your own heart. In
[2:10:13] darkness, you cry out to him, "Show me
[2:10:16] the issues of my heart." In public gaze,
[2:10:22] you see them because other people see
[2:10:25] them and they confront you with them.
[2:10:28] And that's when we really squirm. Let
[2:10:31] the saints say, "Amen."
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; The vessel, the vessel, serve. All
[2:10:35] right. Uh this this inspection is a
[2:10:38] period of being openly tested. I mean,
[2:10:41] all of us would rather go through a
[2:10:43] trial in a closet,
[2:10:46] but that's if we were in a closet, we
[2:10:47] might not have a trial, but living life
[2:10:50] out here in the open, uh, you don't
[2:10:52] always get to duck out when you have a
[2:10:54] hardship. So, who you really are, let me
[2:10:57] give you an example, and I don't want to
[2:10:58] hurt anybody's feelings or or bring up
[2:11:00] sad events, but coming to church in a
[2:11:05] camp meeting service on the day of the
[2:11:08] darkest tragedy that this church has
[2:11:10] ever experienced
[2:11:12] and praising God and praying the glory
[2:11:15] down and worshiping the Lord and
[2:11:19] exalting God in the midst of the hurt
[2:11:22] and the pain and the loss and the
[2:11:24] questions and the misunderstanding.
[2:11:25] understanding.
[2:11:27] That's a way to press on.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; That's who you really are.
[2:11:33] When when you can behave like that in
[2:11:36] the heat,
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; when you can shut out every other
[2:11:42] thought and every other image,
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; and you can glorify God, not because you
[2:11:49] have nothing to be sorrowful about, but
[2:11:52] glorify him because he's worthy, because
[2:11:54] he's never failed you, because he's
[2:11:56] faithful.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; That's the testimony.
[2:12:01] That's the real testimony.
[2:12:04] It's not well-worded responses.
[2:12:08] It's what you do in the heat of the
[2:12:10] moment. And that's why God puts us in
[2:12:12] public gaze.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; That's why you have to answer to these
[2:12:16] things. And I have everywhere I've gone.
[2:12:18] First question I've been asked by people
[2:12:20] I barely know is about that particular
[2:12:23] moment of tragedy.
[2:12:25] And I use it every time as an example to
[2:12:27] say that in the hardest moment, God's
[2:12:30] people, if they hold on to him, they
[2:12:33] rise to the top like cream.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; And in that, God is glorified, not them.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Cuz they're still the flawed people they
[2:12:42] were before.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; But but the cream comes to the top and
[2:12:45] with it, God is exalted and glorified.
[2:12:48] And if God, you're going to, I'm telling
[2:12:50] you, you're going to come to the place
[2:12:53] where you really, more than anything
[2:12:56] else, some of you may not get there till
[2:12:59] after 50, but I hope I hope you come
[2:13:01] quickly.
[2:13:03] You're going to realize the value of God
[2:13:05] getting glory for his name in
[2:13:08] everything. And it changes the way when
[2:13:10] you get a good good revelation of that.
[2:13:12] It changes the way you respond because
[2:13:14] you want to respond in a way
[2:13:18] you want to behave in a way that he will
[2:13:21] ultimately
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; be glorified.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; Can anybody understand that? Got to
[2:13:26] hurry. Got to hurry.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. There's a spiritual parallel in all
[2:13:30] this.
[2:13:31] This vessel symbolizes seasons of
[2:13:34] visibility where God allows your life to
[2:13:37] be seen, to be tested, to be refined
[2:13:40] before others.
[2:13:42] Unlike the darkness of the vessel of
[2:13:44] misunderstanding, here you are in open.
[2:13:47] You are in the open under observation.
[2:13:51] You weren't meant to stay in that vessel
[2:13:53] long, just long enough for God to watch,
[2:13:56] to get a good look at what's bubbling in
[2:13:59] you.
[2:14:02] Because the wine maker controls the
[2:14:04] amount of time that's spent in the
[2:14:06] vessel of public gaze
[2:14:09] by the bubbles.
[2:14:13] Not enough bubbles, more time. Too many
[2:14:16] bubbles, enough time, dumping into
[2:14:19] something else.
[2:14:22] Does that make any sense? So be careful
[2:14:24] how you bubble.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Not just your neighbors watching, God's
[2:14:32] watching how you bubble. Lord, let me
[2:14:34] bubble right. Hallelujah. Let me bubble
[2:14:37] right. So the characteristics of this
[2:14:39] season quickly, a season where you are
[2:14:41] seen but not necessarily celebrated,
[2:14:47] observed but not always understood.
[2:14:51] Your life is lived in the open and your
[2:14:53] responses are on display.
[2:14:58] Now try to talk me out of my
[2:15:01] observation.
[2:15:03] It's going to be hard to do.
[2:15:06] So that need to defend.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; We've already seen that you how awful
[2:15:12] you acted because you're a grown person
[2:15:14] and you didn't get your way.
[2:15:17] So, at that point, I may not be willing
[2:15:20] and your friends may not be willing to
[2:15:22] hear all the excuses
[2:15:24] because we've already seen how you
[2:15:26] behaved.
[2:15:27] And God didn't ordain you to behave that
[2:15:29] way. But God ordained for us to see it,
[2:15:32] to hold you accountable.
[2:15:35] And that's a tough lesson, folks. I'm
[2:15:37] not going to have no shouting down the
[2:15:38] aisles. I better hush. I better just
[2:15:40] close on this one. But the reality is
[2:15:43] that is for a reason.
[2:15:46] And and not only is God going to hold
[2:15:48] you responsible to correct the way you
[2:15:51] behave that got you in that mess,
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; but God's going to hold those closest to
[2:15:56] you responsible
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; for not holding you to accountability.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; It's all right for you to say, "Now,
[2:16:03] honey, you ought not to have responded
[2:16:06] that way."
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; Just a minute.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; Come on, pastor. earn your paycheck.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; We don't want no freeloading preacher
[2:16:18] around here. We want you to work for
[2:16:20] your money.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; Well, here I'm working.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; It's all right to say, "My sweet
[2:16:26] husband."
[2:16:29] Somebody said, "You're going to cause
[2:16:31] riots in here." No, no, no.
[2:16:35] It just may be a opportunity for a
[2:16:37] Zapora.
[2:16:40] There is a time. And listen, that's why
[2:16:42] marriage has to be that way.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; That 50/50 junk is a new age lie.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; It's a fraud. Marriage is not 50/50. And
[2:16:55] if that's how you entered marriage, no
[2:16:57] wonder it's been so bumpy.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; Marriage is 100% and 100%.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; And if you don't do that, and then
[2:17:04] without God's 100%, you're in trouble
[2:17:06] anyway.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; It's a three-fold cord that's not easily
[2:17:10] broken. The scripture said it's got to
[2:17:11] be all of you and all of him. All of him
[2:17:13] and all of her and all of him
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; to make it work. And and and I would if
[2:17:19] I were a woman, if I were the weaker
[2:17:21] vessel in a marriage, I would be careful
[2:17:23] how I chose that moment.
[2:17:26] And it's only a woman who has certainly
[2:17:29] built up her husband in life
[2:17:33] that will have an effective voice in a
[2:17:35] time like that.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:17:39] Because the one thing that a man looks
[2:17:41] for in a relationship, and people really
[2:17:44] don't like this, but it's well
[2:17:46] documented and well proven, is honor.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, what? Because he's the king? No,
[2:17:54] because he's the one bearing the
[2:17:56] responsibility.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; And that becomes very hard when you're
[2:18:02] not living with an honorable man.
[2:18:06] It becomes very hard when you didn't
[2:18:08] live in a home where the husband, the
[2:18:10] man was honored, the husband was
[2:18:12] honored. I don't mean worshiped.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; I mean respected for the job he does.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; I mean told on occasion, thank you for
[2:18:19] making a good living. Thank you for
[2:18:21] working hard for the family.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; And that's not a man who does nothing
[2:18:26] else but work at on the job, come home
[2:18:29] and do nothing. He has responsibility
[2:18:32] particularly in helping mold the
[2:18:34] character of his children.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you, if you'll tell that
[2:18:40] man, "I appreciate you.
[2:18:43] I love you. I honor you. I I I I'm with
[2:18:47] you. I hear you. I will put my phone
[2:18:51] down
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; and hear what you have to say." And then
[2:18:57] you brothers, you have to do the same. I
[2:19:00] will put my phone down.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; I'll turn off the idiot box if we've got
[2:19:06] it owned.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; And I will hear what you have to say.
[2:19:12] If you're not married to her, then you
[2:19:13] don't have you have no right or
[2:19:15] responsibility anyway to demand anything
[2:19:17] of anybody
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; because God doesn't honor that. So, uh,
[2:19:23] if you're if you're in a in a dating
[2:19:25] situation or courtship situation where
[2:19:27] somebody's trying to control somebody,
[2:19:30] that's not God's best.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; It's a give and a take. When God has
[2:19:36] said, "Okay, I've honored this. I'm
[2:19:37] going to honor this." Then it becomes a
[2:19:39] give and a take. If you let a man feel
[2:19:41] that he's respected and honored and
[2:19:44] cherished, I'm telling you, he's in a
[2:19:46] better condition to help you with where
[2:19:48] you have your need. And a woman has to
[2:19:50] be loved. She doesn't have to just be
[2:19:52] told she's loved. She has to be loved.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; She Here's a part I have struggled with
[2:19:57] in my life and marriage. She has to be
[2:19:59] loved in a way that says to her,
[2:20:05] strange creature that she is,
[2:20:11] I'm loved.
[2:20:16] I like to say my love language is
[2:20:18] picking on people. My wife likes to say,
[2:20:20] "It's not mine."
[2:20:25] Don't be like the idiot who says to his
[2:20:27] wife, "I told you I love you on my
[2:20:29] wedding day. If I ever change my mind,
[2:20:31] I'll let you know."
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; That won't work.
[2:20:37] And it's not as much about the telling
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; as it is the showing.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; It's a feeling to her. It's a feeling to
[2:20:46] her. It's a feeling of security and
[2:20:49] warmth and some cherishing. Of course,
[2:20:53] if you build that kind now, if you will
[2:20:55] work toward that, you also then have the
[2:20:59] privilege of saying at the right time in
[2:21:01] the right attitude in the right way and
[2:21:03] and and if it's a especially a wife to
[2:21:05] her husband, you know, you don't want to
[2:21:06] come across being religious or you just
[2:21:08] want to be humble about it. But Zapora,
[2:21:11] you know, she didn't know a lot about
[2:21:12] TAC. She wasn't uh originally Israeli
[2:21:15] and she wasn't quite up on all the
[2:21:16] Hebrew um culture. And so she just said,
[2:21:20] "You've been a bloody husband to me,
[2:21:22] Moshe."
[2:21:25] She she must have been a dark-kinned
[2:21:26] person, but from Australia, because they
[2:21:29] like to use the word bloody a lot, don't
[2:21:30] they? She said, "You've been a bloody
[2:21:32] husband to me, Moses." What could he
[2:21:34] say? He hadn't obeyed God. And the men
[2:21:37] were suffering because the leader had
[2:21:39] not obeyed God.
[2:21:42] and she had to hold him to
[2:21:43] accountability. And I don't know if it
[2:21:46] stepped on his ego or broke his pride or
[2:21:48] what it did, but I want to tell you
[2:21:50] something. He didn't have the worst pain
[2:21:51] coming.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; The worst pain was coming to all those
[2:21:55] Hebrew men out there that now had to be
[2:21:57] circumcised as adults.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; Because Moses had stepped away from his
[2:22:04] spiritual duty.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; A relationship is about accountability.
[2:22:16] A pushy woman, it's not going to work.
[2:22:21] An overbearing husband,
[2:22:23] it's not really going to build that kind
[2:22:25] of an atmosphere.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; So, there's a whole lot of gazing going
[2:22:30] on at home sometime. when you see the
[2:22:32] best, when you see the worst. And God
[2:22:36] lets us see the worst and feel the worst
[2:22:39] and hear the worst about our own selves
[2:22:41] sometime because he wants us to go off
[2:22:44] and lay it before him.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; It's all right, brother. It's all right,
[2:22:49] sister, to say to the Lord, "If I could
[2:22:50] have changed it in my own power, I
[2:22:52] already would have. Now I'm coming to
[2:22:55] you." Yes,
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; that's the El Shadai blessing.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; That he will do for you.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; What you can't do for yourself.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; What you cannot Hallelujah. Woo. What
[2:23:10] you can't do, what I can't do for
[2:23:12] myself,
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; he can do for me.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; But I got to be honest with him. Why do
[2:23:16] I have to be honest with him? He knows
[2:23:18] anyway.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; Because the honesty is not for him.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; It's for you.
[2:23:25] It's getting your mouth around the
[2:23:27] words, "I was wrong."
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; It's powerful.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; It's powerful. It's not too late.
[2:23:38] Hallelujah.
[2:23:41] Hallelujah. We're nearly done for
[2:23:43] Sunday.
[2:23:45] Praise God. This is a season of public
[2:23:48] testing. Heaven observes. The church
[2:23:51] takes note.
[2:23:53] And the enemy lies in weight
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; and you've got to endure it.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; It's a season where you are visible,
[2:24:02] tested, watched, sometimes opposed, and
[2:24:05] expected at all times to represent God.
[2:24:09] It's hard. It's not easy.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; Others see your flaws and God confronts
[2:24:14] your image.
[2:24:16] This is not to humiliate you. It is all
[2:24:18] about refinement. This is a stage where
[2:24:21] exposure refineses. Here, God doesn't
[2:24:23] just work through misunderstanding. He
[2:24:25] uses truth under pressure.
[2:24:28] Oh, you didn't hear me.
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; The first vessel was misunderstanding.
[2:24:33] Now he's operating with truth under
[2:24:36] pressure.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; The the the hardest truth is truth under
[2:24:40] pressure to reveal deeper need in us for
[2:24:43] integrity.
[2:24:45] It has to be about discipline and
[2:24:46] accountability. When it's his bride
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; that's being refined. He's not courting
[2:24:50] a church.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; He's building a bride.
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; He's building a wife.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; In order in order to be his wife, you're
[2:24:58] going to have to have his character.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; And that don't take place if you're like
[2:25:03] Moab and you've never been poured from
[2:25:04] vessel to vessel. You're just a little
[2:25:06] squeaky Christian sitting on the pew
[2:25:07] living a double triple life. But when
[2:25:10] God starts putting the pressure on and
[2:25:11] you have to be real with yourself.
[2:25:13] Honesty starts with yourself and with
[2:25:16] God. The public gaze tests the
[2:25:18] durability of private devotion.
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; You said you were going to pray, did
[2:25:24] you? You said you were going to pray for
[2:25:26] her. Did you pray for her?
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; Pressure to represent God faithfully.
[2:25:30] Your character is your witness. The
[2:25:32] smallest reaction can glorify Christ
[2:25:35] or bring reproach.
[2:25:38] We all ought to know that by the
[2:25:40] volleyball uh you know trials of the
[2:25:44] last it's been a while but you know
[2:25:46] several years
[2:25:49] grown men with babies.
[2:25:53] God turns the light on us.
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; It's humiliating.
[2:25:58] But the reality is it's so that you can
[2:26:01] say to him, "Oh,
[2:26:04] I thought I had that under control.
[2:26:11] It didn't matter. Oh, it didn't matter.
[2:26:13] You acted like all that and it didn't
[2:26:14] matter. You nearly cussed and it didn't
[2:26:17] matter.
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; You acted like a three-year-old. I'm
[2:26:20] going to take my marbles and go home."
[2:26:22] And it didn't matter. It did matter. And
[2:26:24] God was testing what was in your heart.
[2:26:27] And it had to come to the surface, not
[2:26:29] so that others would be able to judge
[2:26:30] you, but so that you would find some
[2:26:32] accountability in your exposure and go
[2:26:35] home and lay it before the Lord. But
[2:26:37] here's what people do. They go home and
[2:26:39] justify it to their families. They go
[2:26:41] home and make excuses for the way they
[2:26:42] behaved. That didn't do us any good.
[2:26:45] Amen.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; Get in there behind that veil
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; and let the fire of God's shakana glory
[2:26:52] burn out
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; the humanity that has left.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Musicians are easing this way.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; Your character is your witness.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; Not not your language. Not not your
[2:27:07] hallelujah and praise the Lords and the
[2:27:09] prophet dids
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; and saids.
[2:27:13] It's your character. It's the way you
[2:27:15] live. That's your witness.
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; God's not just dealing with others
[2:27:20] perceptions.
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; He's showing you your own blind spots.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; Everybody has a blind spot.
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; Everybody has a tender place.
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; This isn't a This isn't demotion. What
[2:27:33] I'm preaching about today is not about
[2:27:35] demotion. It's a crucible.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; And we need a crucible.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we need sometime more than
[2:27:43] one.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, I got to know what
[2:27:46] a crucible is." Well, a crucible is a
[2:27:48] container used to heat metal to burn off
[2:27:52] impurities.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; And so, the word has come to mean by
[2:27:55] definition a transformative experience
[2:27:58] through which an individual comes to a
[2:28:01] new sense of identity.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, God, send the crucible. Yes, Lord.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; When we need it, send it.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; Because we need a new identification,
[2:28:13] one that's found in you and not in our
[2:28:16] old coping mechanisms.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; We spend too much time, brothers and
[2:28:22] sisters, taking ourselves out of the
[2:28:26] accountability.
[2:28:28] And we need to spend a little more time
[2:28:30] putting ourselves in.
[2:28:33] There was a capstone in one of those
[2:28:36] experiences
[2:28:37] and it come flying over the hill.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; It hovered above gently above the top of
[2:28:45] the of the pyramid-shaped mountain of
[2:28:47] Zion, which is the throne of God. It's
[2:28:51] not only the the city of Zion. It's the
[2:28:54] mountain of the Lord.
[2:28:58] It's the throne of God.
[2:29:02] It's the judgment seat for the rest of
[2:29:04] the world at some point.
[2:29:08] They don't come any higher.
[2:29:11] God said, "Set a boundary around the
[2:29:15] base of the mountain."
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; That Old Testament that people complain
[2:29:24] about us preaching from it so often
[2:29:26] using it as example. You're going to
[2:29:29] find out one day that the principles
[2:29:32] that God lined out for us in that old
[2:29:35] covenant,
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; it really is the definition of our
[2:29:38] eternity.
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; Because even in eternity, we will see
[2:29:42] those realities and truths
[2:29:45] displayed before our very eyes.
[2:29:48] Who will ascend the hill of the Lord?
[2:29:53] There's a church out there that'll never
[2:29:56] get past the border
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; at the base of the mountain.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; Some will have eternal life because they
[2:30:03] called on the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; Some will have eternal life because they
[2:30:09] called on and died first first group
[2:30:11] because they called on the name of Jesus
[2:30:13] Christ and went by the grave. And
[2:30:15] there'll be more who will call on the
[2:30:17] name of Jesus Christ and then give their
[2:30:20] lives
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; in the great tribulation period, the
[2:30:23] last three and a half years of of
[2:30:25] Daniel's troubles,
[2:30:30] and they'll find theirelves with eternal
[2:30:32] life. Whosoever call upon the name of
[2:30:34] the Lord shall be saved.
[2:30:38] I just love to hear uh uh message people
[2:30:41] trying to say that no one is saved
[2:30:43] outside the message.
[2:30:47] You are narrowminded
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; and you don't have the same experience
[2:30:52] that others have found
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; in the word because you can't change the
[2:30:58] Bible
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; to try to make it fit your favorite
[2:31:01] quote.
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; But there are boundaries around Mount
[2:31:05] Si. Yes.
[2:31:09] &gt;&gt; And their boundaries around Mount Zion
[2:31:11] because the Sinai of the old is the Zion
[2:31:14] of the new.
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; The Gibian, the order of Gibian will not
[2:31:18] work. What what happened in the
[2:31:19] tabernacle in the wilderness in Gibian
[2:31:21] will not operate in the tabernacle of
[2:31:23] David on Mount Zion. It's a different
[2:31:25] experience altogether. But the same holy
[2:31:28] is there.
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. In fact, the holy has been
[2:31:32] put back because in that tabernacle,
[2:31:36] they continued to worship and offer
[2:31:38] blood and do all the things that God
[2:31:40] told Moses to do in Exodus 25. But they
[2:31:43] knew good and well that the ark wasn't
[2:31:45] there because they had marched out like
[2:31:48] a bunch of religious zealots into a
[2:31:50] battlefield when God never told them to
[2:31:52] take the holy out there into the
[2:31:53] battlefield. He said, "You take your
[2:31:55] praise
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; and you scream, let God arise, but you
[2:31:59] don't have to lift the box.
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; You just scream, let God arise, and
[2:32:02] he'll come." But they said, "Hey, this
[2:32:04] is like a good luck charm."
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; Like a crucifix
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; or a belt buckle
[2:32:15] or I got one of the pyramid rocks. So do
[2:32:17] I. But it ain't no good luck charm.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I said, "I called them
[2:32:25] up here to help you, not to help me. I'm
[2:32:28] not done yet."
[2:32:32] God said, "I I I" and there they just
[2:32:35] kept doing it, kept doing it, kept doing
[2:32:36] it. But the ark was no longer there
[2:32:38] because here they marched it out and it
[2:32:39] was captured away by the Philistines.
[2:32:44] But they kept doing kept doing the same
[2:32:46] thing. Three songs,
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; 30 minutes of a tape,
[2:32:53] little comment from the preacher so he
[2:32:55] can earn his you know
[2:32:59] a little song at the end. Lights off way
[2:33:01] before nine. Let's get out of here.
[2:33:04] Somebody's got to pay the bills.
[2:33:07] Doing the rituals, but no holy.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; The holy was gone. But they just kept
[2:33:13] doing it, hoping people would forget
[2:33:15] their silly mistake. David said, "No way
[2:33:18] will we get that thing back. We're going
[2:33:20] to put it up there on the on the on
[2:33:22] Zion." Woo!
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; And we're going to put it there without
[2:33:28] a veil.
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; And people are going to come from all
[2:33:30] over this land and worship God before
[2:33:32] the ark of the covenant.
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; And they're going to see with their own
[2:33:35] eyes that it's there because the new
[2:33:37] order, it's not about secrecy,
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; not in the congregation. in the heart.
[2:33:44] It's about exposure.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; Show people what is holy.
[2:33:49] &gt;&gt; Now, all of that's Old Testament,
[2:33:52] but it's setting an order.
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; Hear that uh capstone? It's hovering
[2:33:58] over there. And and you think, "Oh my,
[2:34:00] this is the moment. The moment we've
[2:34:01] waited on, it's going to sit down on
[2:34:03] top. That perfect love is going to sit
[2:34:05] down on top of that uh uh pyramid." And
[2:34:08] some of you don't know what we're
[2:34:09] talking about. I'm sorry. Some of you
[2:34:10] do. It's going to sit there like that.
[2:34:12] And all of a sudden, that black gloved
[2:34:14] hand said
[2:34:16] no. Not now. It must have been thinking,
[2:34:19] you know, and and shoved it away.
[2:34:24] And it comes down, you know, to find it.
[2:34:27] It's it's the cornerstone
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; that the builders have rejected. And I
[2:34:32] don't know if you know this or not, but
[2:34:33] the capstone of a pyramid was not what
[2:34:35] sat on top.
[2:34:39] It was the foundation stone that was in
[2:34:41] the bottom.
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; Sorry.
[2:34:46] And so if one don't have it on the top,
[2:34:48] the next thing you need to figure out is
[2:34:50] does it have it down here? Because
[2:34:52] that's where the spot was left for it.
[2:34:55] You've got to remember that these
[2:34:57] pyramids were were originally designed
[2:35:00] not excuse me, they were originally
[2:35:01] designed to be something precious,
[2:35:04] but they were hijacked for something
[2:35:06] pagan
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; for a long time.
[2:35:09] They represent a lot to us. But we're
[2:35:10] not pyramidologists. We don't we don't
[2:35:12] study pyramidology. We don't embrace
[2:35:15] Israel British Israelism, which is a
[2:35:18] pyramidology doctrine. We don't we don't
[2:35:21] embrace that. But God speaks out of that
[2:35:23] mountain because it represents the
[2:35:24] virtues of Christ. Amen.
[2:35:28] &gt;&gt; And here I'm thinking that that stone is
[2:35:30] about to find its place wherever here or
[2:35:32] there. And it comes flying over the
[2:35:34] hill. And what does it do? It strikes
[2:35:37] the forehead
[2:35:40] because sitting up there as an ornament
[2:35:43] is not going to be the answer for the
[2:35:45] bride.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual thing we're talking
[2:35:47] about now. But if that love if you can
[2:35:50] if you can line yourself up and and all
[2:35:53] that's in that headstone capstone, if
[2:35:57] that strikes you,
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; why here?
[2:36:04] because that represents not just the
[2:36:05] intellect.
[2:36:08] It really represents the fullness of who
[2:36:11] you are is represented here because
[2:36:14] you've either got the mind of of an
[2:36:17] unregenerated sinner or you've got the
[2:36:19] mind of Christ.
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; So that's helping make sure that you've
[2:36:22] got the mind of Christ. It's bringing
[2:36:24] head knowledge
[2:36:26] to heart knowledge.
[2:36:28] &gt;&gt; And there's something you need to
[2:36:29] remember. both mount Zion and the
[2:36:33] headstone was alive.
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; So, it's bringing that life
[2:36:41] inside of the believer.
[2:36:44] &gt;&gt; And then what we're left to do is deal
[2:36:46] with the stuff that's got to get pushed
[2:36:49] out so that we can surrender to perfect
[2:36:52] love. Because I'm telling you, he said,
[2:36:55] "Without perfect love, without perfect
[2:36:57] love, without perfect love,
[2:37:01] we can toot our horns and think we've
[2:37:02] got it, but it's not going to be uh uh
[2:37:05] something you can fudge on.
[2:37:08] &gt;&gt; We're going to have to produce it. It's
[2:37:10] growth sometimes through criticism.
[2:37:13] God is trying to bring us to a place
[2:37:15] where it's authenticity over
[2:37:17] performance. Amen.
[2:37:18] &gt;&gt; It burns away performative
[2:37:20] righteousness, forcing you into the true
[2:37:23] identity in Christ.
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to close with this. I I I'm
[2:37:28] going to I'm going to get this just a
[2:37:31] piece of this.
[2:37:35] In Psalm 26:2,
[2:37:38] the psalmist said, "Examine me, O Lord,
[2:37:41] and prove me.
[2:37:44] Try my reigns
[2:37:46] and my heart.
[2:37:48] The Amplified said, "Examine me, O Lord,
[2:37:52] and prove me."
[2:37:55] Do you really want to pray that prayer?
[2:37:58] Because if you do, he's going to hear
[2:38:00] you.
[2:38:02] And what we really want is for him to
[2:38:05] whisper in our ear what we need to work
[2:38:08] on.
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be lovely?
[2:38:13] you just come real real quietly and tell
[2:38:15] me what I need to do different and I'm
[2:38:17] going to work on it now. Jesus, but
[2:38:19] that's not the prayer that this psalmist
[2:38:21] was praying.
[2:38:23] He was literally, if you look at the
[2:38:25] original words, he was saying, "Expose
[2:38:27] me.
[2:38:29] Rip off the sh the charade,
[2:38:34] the facade.
[2:38:38] dig to the deepest part of who I am and
[2:38:42] let me see my own heart and let me see
[2:38:46] my own emotions
[2:38:48] and let me see my own response
[2:38:51] so that I can throw it before you
[2:38:57] and be new. The Amplified said, "Examine
[2:39:00] me, oh Lord, and prove me and test my
[2:39:03] heart and test my mind
[2:39:06] and see who I am." And that can't always
[2:39:10] come with a whisper. It sometimes has to
[2:39:13] come through public gaze.
[2:39:17] And nobody wants to hear such a thing.
[2:39:21] And I want to I want to give you this
[2:39:22] experience in closing. I feel like that
[2:39:26] I would not have
[2:39:28] finished without this. Are you musicians
[2:39:31] listening too? Thank you for sitting up
[2:39:34] there. Many years ago, the Lord spoke to
[2:39:38] my life in an ordinary moment.
[2:39:42] We were enjoying a beautiful time at the
[2:39:44] beach in Fort Morgan with brother and
[2:39:46] sister West. We were going to leave
[2:39:49] there and go to a conference that was
[2:39:51] being held in in lower Alabama and they
[2:39:55] had arranged a a beach house. And if you
[2:40:00] know anything about Fort Morgan, it's
[2:40:01] away from the hustle and the bustle of
[2:40:03] Gulf Shores and Orange Beach. It's way
[2:40:05] out there. We saw things that we'd never
[2:40:07] seen before. Little baby seahorses and
[2:40:10] bigger shells. And it was just a
[2:40:12] wonderful, wonderful week.
[2:40:15] and we were having a great time and the
[2:40:17] baby who was Mariah at the time was
[2:40:20] asleep and she's she's turning
[2:40:23] 19
[2:40:25] this week
[2:40:28] and then Benjamin's birthday and he he's
[2:40:30] he's a lot more than 19.
[2:40:33] She was the baby and she was asleep and
[2:40:36] I'd volunteered a couple days in a row
[2:40:37] to sit with the baby to stay with the
[2:40:39] baby while she took her nap. We could
[2:40:41] walk to the beach and Stacy could go
[2:40:44] after feeding her could go back down to
[2:40:45] the beach and I tiptoed into the
[2:40:47] bathroom like we do when we have small
[2:40:49] children. Everything is is is has to be
[2:40:52] quieter seems. And uh she was asleep in
[2:40:57] the play pen in the bedroom. And I
[2:40:59] walked into the little washroom that was
[2:41:01] attached and I washed my face and hands
[2:41:03] because everybody knows that sticky
[2:41:04] feeling you get from the winds at the
[2:41:07] beach, the sticky and the sand and ocean
[2:41:10] water and all that stuff. And I thought
[2:41:12] about taking a shower. Then I thought,
[2:41:14] "No, because she might wake up and she
[2:41:15] would cry and be scared. And I'll just
[2:41:17] wash my hands and my face and I think
[2:41:20] that'll make me feel better." And I and
[2:41:21] there's a towel hanging there. And I
[2:41:23] just I'm telling you that I wasn't
[2:41:26] praying. I wasn't humming. I wasn't
[2:41:28] singing. I wasn't meditating on the
[2:41:30] Lord. Wasn't reading the Bible. Just
[2:41:32] drying my hands. And I heard a voice
[2:41:36] and and my first thought was uh I got to
[2:41:39] tell brother West to hold it down
[2:41:42] because he's come back and he's going to
[2:41:44] wake up the baby. And I actually started
[2:41:46] to make a make a move and and I heard
[2:41:49] the voice clearly that time. I will give
[2:41:52] you a sign
[2:41:55] and I will make you a gazing stock.
[2:42:00] And I
[2:42:05] those words
[2:42:08] cut deep
[2:42:11] and my first reaction was no Lord not
[2:42:14] that
[2:42:16] I certainly had not been praying or
[2:42:17] asking for any kind of promotion.
[2:42:20] The very thought of becoming a spectacle
[2:42:23] exposed, inspected, even ridiculed was
[2:42:26] more than unsettling.
[2:42:28] And he repeated the strange sentence to
[2:42:30] me again. In my spirit, I don't have to
[2:42:33] sit here and try to explain to you how
[2:42:34] to hear the voice of God.
[2:42:36] &gt;&gt; If you've ever heard it, you know it.
[2:42:38] And you'll know it the next time.
[2:42:40] &gt;&gt; How do I know it's not me? It's not your
[2:42:43] voice. It's not your thought. It comes
[2:42:46] from another dimension, from another
[2:42:47] place. And if it sounds like you, it's
[2:42:50] probably you.
[2:42:54] But if it sounds like something you
[2:42:56] wouldn't be thinking or saying, it can
[2:42:58] often be the Lord. And I knew this was
[2:43:01] him because I don't generally use the
[2:43:04] word gazing stock, first of all. And I
[2:43:06] sure wasn't asking for a sign. He
[2:43:08] repeated it again. I will give you a
[2:43:11] sign and I'll make you a gazing stock.
[2:43:14] But this time it was more forceful. And
[2:43:16] I said out loud, "Oh Lord, no." And then
[2:43:20] I remembered Mariah.
[2:43:22] I cannot say at the moment that I even
[2:43:25] fully began to process the unpacking or
[2:43:28] the digesting of what that meant. But I
[2:43:30] knew it did not sound like fun.
[2:43:33] And I knew that when I mentioned it to
[2:43:34] Stacy later, she didn't seem too
[2:43:36] thrilled with the presumed implications
[2:43:38] of her husband being a gazing stock. And
[2:43:41] yet the very next night, the Lord took
[2:43:43] me to a scripture and he said, "Here it
[2:43:45] is." I'd say a 7-Eleven. Ask thee a sign
[2:43:47] of the Lord thy God. Ask it either in
[2:43:50] the depth or in the height above. The
[2:43:53] problem is I hadn't asked for a sign and
[2:43:55] I wasn't planning on asking for a sign.
[2:43:57] In the amplified it said, "Ask for
[2:44:00] yourself a sign, a token, a proof of the
[2:44:03] Lord your God, one that will convince
[2:44:05] you that God has spoken and will keep
[2:44:07] his word."
[2:44:08] &gt;&gt; Ask it either in the depth below or in
[2:44:10] the height above. Let it be as deep as
[2:44:13] shol or as high as heaven. But ask. I
[2:44:17] told the Lord that if this was some
[2:44:18] message about scrutiny and more
[2:44:20] criticism
[2:44:22] that I had already been a magnet for
[2:44:24] both my entire life and ministry. I
[2:44:27] really wasn't interested in more.
[2:44:30] And he gave me a scripture again.
[2:44:33] Hebrews 10 32-33. I'm going to do it
[2:44:36] amplified for time. But be ever mindful
[2:44:38] of the days gone by in which after you
[2:44:41] were first spiritually enlightened, you
[2:44:43] endured a great and painful struggle.
[2:44:47] We have those verses if someone could
[2:44:49] put them up.
[2:44:53] Be ever mindful. I'll wait.
[2:44:58] I realize your uh understanding is
[2:45:02] probably expired here, but I'm not
[2:45:04] leaving until I get this out.
[2:45:06] I have to live with me between now and
[2:45:08] Tuesday. But be ever mindful of the days
[2:45:11] gone by in which after you were first
[2:45:13] spiritually enlightened, you endured a
[2:45:15] great and painful struggle. Sometimes
[2:45:18] being yourselves a gazing stock,
[2:45:21] publicly exposed to insults and abuse
[2:45:23] and distress and sometimes claiming
[2:45:25] fellowship and making common cause with
[2:45:29] others who were so treated. What
[2:45:36] God is speaking
[2:45:39] through his apostle to say that when you
[2:45:43] when you become a gazing stock and
[2:45:46] everyone's looking at you and
[2:45:47] scrutinizing you, there's a purpose in
[2:45:50] that.
[2:45:51] &gt;&gt; It's so that you can understand what
[2:45:54] other people go through in their season
[2:45:57] of being overly scrutinized. And God
[2:46:00] said, "I'll get glory in that
[2:46:02] &gt;&gt; if you're willing to let me put you in a
[2:46:06] place that's going to cause every eye to
[2:46:08] be on you a time or two.
[2:46:11] If you'll let me do that, I will work a
[2:46:14] work in you like I have in others."
[2:46:17] Well, I'm in then. If if if you'll do in
[2:46:21] me what you've done in others,
[2:46:24] if if you'll bring me to a higher place
[2:46:27] &gt;&gt; of obedience and surrender
[2:46:30] &gt;&gt; like you have others, I'm in. Lord, I
[2:46:34] want to change my answer from no to yes.
[2:46:39] &gt;&gt; A gazing stock is a person or thing that
[2:46:42] is gazed at by many, especially with
[2:46:44] curiosity or contempt.
[2:46:48] Have you ever said about somebody they
[2:46:50] either love you or hate you? They either
[2:46:53] love him or hate him. You ever said that
[2:46:55] about anybody? How many of you ever said
[2:46:56] about me? Don't raise your hand. Many
[2:46:59] people have said it to me. Brother Shel,
[2:47:01] there about you. People either love you
[2:47:02] or they hate you. There's not a lot of
[2:47:04] in between.
[2:47:06] That's part of the word. I didn't ask
[2:47:08] for this identity. I was just drying my
[2:47:10] hands, folks. But anything that God does
[2:47:13] for a leader, it's to send a message.
[2:47:17] Not that I got a special guy here. It's
[2:47:20] you're going to need to know this
[2:47:22] lesson. You're going to need to see it
[2:47:24] because he's not the only one that's
[2:47:26] going to be a gazing stock.
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; The pressure comes on all of us
[2:47:33] &gt;&gt; because God's getting something out of
[2:47:34] us so that he can get something in us.
[2:47:37] &gt;&gt; That sound good, anybody? And in
[2:47:39] closing, just let me say in Hebrew, the
[2:47:41] word is the same word in in uh that,
[2:47:44] excuse me, in in Greek, I put Hebrew
[2:47:47] because in Hebrews, what I just read in
[2:47:50] Hebrews, the word is a Greek word, and
[2:47:52] it's the word where we get the English
[2:47:55] word theater.
[2:47:57] And it's it means to bring upon the
[2:48:00] theater to be made a spectacle of to be
[2:48:02] made a gazing stock both by reproaches
[2:48:06] and afflictions.
[2:48:09] Now, who's in?
[2:48:11] I didn't think there'd be a lot of
[2:48:13] volunteers.
[2:48:14] &gt;&gt; Well, here I need to close by telling
[2:48:15] you, you don't really get to decide.
[2:48:20] &gt;&gt; God gave me an invitation, but he'd
[2:48:21] already put me there.
[2:48:24] &gt;&gt; He just was telling me what he'd already
[2:48:26] done.
[2:48:27] I'm going to bring some scrutiny in your
[2:48:29] life. I'm going to let you behave good
[2:48:32] and you're also going to behave bad.
[2:48:35] What's in you is going to come out and
[2:48:37] somebody's going to see it and they're
[2:48:38] going to know it and going to be judged
[2:48:40] for it. But the reason is it's going to
[2:48:43] drive you to the secret place.
[2:48:46] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:48:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, it does.
[2:48:49] &gt;&gt; It drives me to the secret place.
[2:48:53] There's somebody in the church this
[2:48:54] morning who said just recently, "I don't
[2:48:56] understand it. I don't understand all
[2:48:58] the criticism. I don't understand it." I
[2:49:01] just listened to a tape where the
[2:49:02] preacher, Brother Shel, was preaching in
[2:49:04] 1995,
[2:49:06] and he's preaching the same thing in
[2:49:07] 1995 that he's preaching in 2025.
[2:49:12] &gt;&gt; So, the one thing you can't say is, "I
[2:49:14] didn't change my mind along the way.
[2:49:19] I've understood from the beginning that
[2:49:21] balance
[2:49:24] it's what brings us to truth
[2:49:26] &gt;&gt; and it's it's what keeps us in truth
[2:49:29] because it's so easy to lean to the
[2:49:31] right or the left. Now I'm waiting on
[2:49:33] that. I want that. I want that full
[2:49:35] experience
[2:49:36] &gt;&gt; of that headstone. How does it come? Not
[2:49:39] with criticism. It's from him. And what
[2:49:41] how does it come with shouts of what?
[2:49:45] &gt;&gt; How many of you are in now? Amen.
[2:49:47] &gt;&gt; You can get through it with grace. Let's
[2:49:48] stand.
[2:49:50] &gt;&gt; Amazing
[2:49:53] grace,
[2:49:55] how sweet
[2:49:58] the sound
[2:50:01] that say
[2:50:04] [Music]
[2:50:07] like me.
[2:50:12] Oh, I once
[2:50:15] was lost.
[2:50:17] Oh, but now
[2:50:21] I'm found. He's going to get you through
[2:50:23] it.
[2:50:29] &gt;&gt; You got his life on the inside. He's
[2:50:31] going to get you through it. was grace
[2:50:36] that taught
[2:50:39] my heart
[2:50:42] to fear.
[2:50:44] And it was grace
[2:50:47] my fears
[2:50:50] relieved.
[2:50:54] Oh, how precious
[2:50:58] [Music]
[2:51:02] that grace
[2:51:03] [Music]
[2:51:05] appear
[2:51:07] the hour.
[2:51:11] &gt;&gt; Why don't you worship God with us for a
[2:51:13] minute? Grace is going to get you
[2:51:16] through the scrutiny when it comes to
[2:51:19] grace. that verse again that taught
[2:51:23] my heart
[2:51:26] to fear
[2:51:28] and it was grace
[2:51:32] my fears
[2:51:34] relieved.
[2:51:38] Oh, how precious.
[2:51:42] Just in time.
[2:51:44] Just in time that grace
[2:51:49] appeared.
[2:51:50] Ver.
[2:51:52] [Music]
[2:51:54] &gt;&gt; If you're worried about getting through
[2:51:57] this vessel of public gaze, think about
[2:52:00] how you come through all the others
[2:52:02] through many,
[2:52:04] many dangerous
[2:52:08] toils.
[2:52:10] Toils and snares.
[2:52:13] I have I have already
[2:52:18] already come.
[2:52:22] &gt;&gt; And what got you through was grace.
[2:52:28] &gt;&gt; Do you really mean that?
[2:52:32] &gt;&gt; Do you recognize her?
[2:52:34] &gt;&gt; Mrs. Grace
[2:52:38] will be.
[2:52:43] &gt;&gt; You got a heavenly home. Sing about it
[2:52:45] with me. When we
[2:52:49] been there
[2:52:51] [Music]
[2:52:53] 10,000.
[2:52:56] All right.
[2:53:00] [Music]
[2:53:02] the sun.
[2:53:06] Oh, we've
[2:53:09] no
[2:53:10] less days
[2:53:13] to see
[2:53:16] God's praise.
[2:53:19] Then when
[2:53:22] we first
[2:53:25] began,
[2:53:27] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. Oh, and praise God.
[2:53:32] Praise God.
[2:53:36] Praise God.
[2:53:38] Praise God.
[2:53:41] Praise God.
[2:53:43] Praise God.
[2:53:46] Praise God.
[2:53:48] &gt;&gt; Tell the Lord, I'm going all the way.
[2:53:51] I'm going to go all the way. Praise God.
[2:53:55] Praise God.
[2:53:57] Oh, praise God.
[2:54:00] Praise God.
[2:54:03] Praise God.
[2:54:06] Praise God.
[2:54:08] Praise God.
[2:54:12] Thank you, Jesus. Oh, praise God.
[2:54:16] Praise God.
[2:54:20] Praise God.
[2:54:22] Praise God.
[2:54:25] Praise God.
[2:54:28] Praise God.
[2:54:31] Praise God.
[2:54:37] Praise God.
[2:54:40] Praise God.
[2:54:43] Praise God.
[2:54:45] Praise God.
[2:54:48] Praise God.
[2:54:51] Praise God. God. Praise God.
[2:55:03] He became sin
[2:55:07] who knew no sin
[2:55:10] that we might become
[2:55:14] his righteousness.
[2:55:18] He humbled himself
[2:55:22] and carried the cross.
[2:55:28] Love so amazing.
[2:55:33] [Music]
[2:55:35] Oh love so amazing.

[2:58:27] All the glory
[2:58:30] gloryy to

[2:58:35] Oh
[2:58:36] the light of the world

[2:58:44] is in you. It's in you.
[2:58:48] All our hope
[2:58:51] is in you.
[2:58:53] &gt;&gt; It's in you, Jesus. and all the gloryy
[2:58:56] [Music]
[2:58:58] to you,
[2:59:00] God, light of the world.
[2:59:04] The light of the world.
[2:59:08] I want you to just wait before the Lord
[2:59:10] for just a moment.
[2:59:12] Uh
[2:59:14] if you're here
[2:59:16] and you recognize
[2:59:19] that you have waited through
[2:59:23] misunderstanding
[2:59:25] and and uh public gaze
[2:59:29] in in your life
[2:59:32] and
[2:59:34] maybe at the time you didn't see that it
[2:59:36] was God
[2:59:38] allowing you to learn some lessons. and
[2:59:43] come up to higher places
[2:59:46] to feel the fellowship of what other
[2:59:48] saints of likeminded faith have to go
[2:59:50] through to get to that place to be
[2:59:53] ultimately used. The goal is a body
[2:59:56] ministry.
[2:59:57] &gt;&gt; It's not a one-man thing. It's a body
[2:59:59] ministry. And you're going to have to be
[3:00:02] able to minister to all the needs of a
[3:00:04] body. Amen.
[3:00:05] &gt;&gt; And brother to brother, sister to
[3:00:07] sister, spirit to spirit, fellowship and
[3:00:09] healing and wholeness. And and had it
[3:00:12] not been for these things, you you
[3:00:14] wouldn't know what it feels like. Now, I
[3:00:16] I know that doesn't make us run to get
[3:00:19] in line to get more of that kind of
[3:00:20] stuff. But here's what we have to do. We
[3:00:23] have to make sure that we learn the
[3:00:25] lesson.
[3:00:27] &gt;&gt; And if you're here today and you say, "I
[3:00:29] I've heard this and and and I'm walking
[3:00:31] through some of that. I've been walking
[3:00:32] through it. It's not not new to me
[3:00:34] today, but I want to make sure that I am
[3:00:38] humbling my heart before the Lord and
[3:00:40] that I've truly learned
[3:00:43] &gt;&gt; because I want to be used in body
[3:00:45] ministry. I want to be able to pray
[3:00:47] sister to sister, brother to brother. I
[3:00:49] want to be able to help people when they
[3:00:51] go through these trials. And I feel ill
[3:00:54] equipped to do it because I'm not sure
[3:00:56] that I picked up all I needed to pick up
[3:00:58] through that through that hour. But I
[3:01:00] want to be wine.
[3:01:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. in the king's cup. If you're here
[3:01:04] like that, would you just join the rest
[3:01:05] of us around the altar? If that's you,
[3:01:08] if you feel any identification to that,
[3:01:10] I realize some people can't really
[3:01:12] identify, but if you can, we're not
[3:01:14] going to shove you or push on your
[3:01:17] sign you up or anything like that,
[3:01:20] but we're just going to pray. And we
[3:01:22] want to pray for people who are willing
[3:01:25] to receive what the Lord has.
[3:01:30] And sometime we're just not willing,
[3:01:32] we're not ready, we're not in that place
[3:01:33] yet to learn the maximum to get the
[3:01:36] benefit.
[3:01:38] And you know, if you got to go through
[3:01:39] it anyhow in life, you might as well get
[3:01:42] the maximum benefit.
[3:01:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:01:45] &gt;&gt; Get this thing wonder done. Let's get it
[3:01:47] done.
[3:01:48] &gt;&gt; Get the victory and and move on
[3:01:51] &gt;&gt; to the next thing because I want the
[3:01:54] leaves left behind. I want the dregs
[3:01:56] left behind. And I've got to be like him
[3:01:59] so that he can fully occupy.
[3:02:02] &gt;&gt; You want to be fully occupied by the
[3:02:04] character and life of Jesus Christ.
[3:02:06] &gt;&gt; That's more than that's more than
[3:02:07] churchity there.
[3:02:09] &gt;&gt; That's sunship in full adoption.
[3:02:12] &gt;&gt; And I believe you. I believe you. Before
[3:02:14] I even before I even looked to see who
[3:02:15] was here, I knew that there would be a
[3:02:18] number of you here because you've
[3:02:20] demonstrated already in your life that
[3:02:22] you want to go the long way, the long
[3:02:24] haul. You didn't get in here to quit.
[3:02:26] You got in here to finish the race.
[3:02:29] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something. You've
[3:02:30] showed a tremendous amount of
[3:02:32] perseverance and dexterity to stand
[3:02:34] where you're standing today. May God
[3:02:36] honor your faith. May he honor your
[3:02:39] faithfulness. And may God bring you to a
[3:02:41] place where he can minister to you and
[3:02:43] then through you
[3:02:44] &gt;&gt; because the bride has a work to do
[3:02:46] before we get out of here.
[3:02:47] &gt;&gt; So just if you'll just raise your hand
[3:02:49] sort of as a surrender to the Lord this
[3:02:51] time. Here I am and I want maximum
[3:02:55] effectiveness
[3:02:57] &gt;&gt; in coming through these things. So let's
[3:03:00] just pray together, not just one.
[3:03:01] Father, here we stand around this altar.
[3:03:04] This is cream rising to the top this
[3:03:06] morning as people all over this room,
[3:03:08] even from their seat are willing to say,
[3:03:11] Lord, I surrender. I I don't like
[3:03:13] everything that happens. I I don't enjoy
[3:03:16] everything that happens, but I know with
[3:03:18] you holding my hand, with you holding my
[3:03:21] hand, with me holding on to you,
[3:03:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'll get through it. And I want to
[3:03:26] give you glory. I want to glory even in
[3:03:30] my trial, even in my persecution, even
[3:03:32] in my test. I want glory to come to your
[3:03:35] name.
[3:03:36] &gt;&gt; This is perhaps not the path I would
[3:03:38] have chosen to get there, but you knew
[3:03:40] me better than I knew myself. And so
[3:03:43] Lord, I just ask right now that my
[3:03:45] attitude be right before you.
[3:03:47] &gt;&gt; Would you agree with me in prayer that
[3:03:49] way? I'd like my attitude just to be
[3:03:51] right before you. I want to have the
[3:03:53] right spirit towards you, Lord.
[3:03:57] &gt;&gt; I don't want any resentment to grow in
[3:04:00] my heart because of what I have had to
[3:04:02] walk through. I want to embrace you and
[3:04:04] love you and adore you without any
[3:04:07] blame, without any resentment. Would you
[3:04:10] would you come right down to the root of
[3:04:12] where that kind of thing uh likes to
[3:04:14] hang
[3:04:16] &gt;&gt; and let your word and by your spirit
[3:04:19] uproot that today in the name of Jesus
[3:04:22] Christ that that there'd be no
[3:04:24] resentment for the trials of the past,
[3:04:26] no resentment for the circumstances that
[3:04:28] I've walked through. Would you uproot
[3:04:30] that now by by your precious authority?
[3:04:33] Would you uproot that right out of my
[3:04:36] life right now for the glory of God?
[3:04:39] Somebody said it couldn't be that
[3:04:40] simple. It has to be that simple. It's
[3:04:43] as simple as identifying that there's a
[3:04:45] need
[3:04:46] &gt;&gt; and then giving it to God.
[3:04:48] &gt;&gt; Lord, I have a need. I don't want that
[3:04:49] growing in me because what grows will
[3:04:52] eventually bloom and what blooms
[3:04:54] spreads.
[3:04:56] It's from the blooming of the flower
[3:04:57] that the seed are distributed. I don't
[3:04:59] want to distribute any seed to anyone
[3:05:02] else because of what I've had to go
[3:05:04] through. I want to be able to offer help
[3:05:06] and assistance and I want it to be
[3:05:09] preemptive. I don't want them to have to
[3:05:11] go through. It's our desire, Lord, that
[3:05:14] enough of us have been through enough
[3:05:16] different things in life that we could
[3:05:18] help one another and that we wouldn't
[3:05:20] all have to go through the exact same
[3:05:21] kind of a trial. The purpose is to get
[3:05:24] from the bottom of that mountain to the
[3:05:26] top. The purpose is to have the virtues
[3:05:28] of Christ born in everyone's heart. One
[3:05:33] by one, they come. It's a birth. They
[3:05:35] don't come at the same time like we
[3:05:37] would prefer. But one by one, the
[3:05:40] characters of Jesus Christ, all the
[3:05:43] attributes of his character are birthed
[3:05:45] and formed in us. It changes us then
[3:05:50] from glory to glory. And here we are
[3:05:53] with what we don't understand. We
[3:05:55] surrender.
[3:05:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:05:57] &gt;&gt; With what we don't identify or recognize
[3:05:59] in our life, we surrender.
[3:06:02] We just say, "Lord, if that's who I am,
[3:06:06] train me, mold me, teach me."
[3:06:10] Lord, may we not be the offender.
[3:06:15] You said, "It's better that a millstone
[3:06:17] were tied about your neck and you were
[3:06:19] cast in the depths of the sea than to be
[3:06:21] a hindrance to one of my little ones."
[3:06:23] Yes, Lord.
[3:06:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, in all my struggles, in all my
[3:06:26] trials, and all my victories, I don't
[3:06:28] want to be I do not want to be a a a
[3:06:31] stumbling block, and I don't want to be
[3:06:34] a millstone around somebody else's neck.
[3:06:37] So, Lord, I ask that I would not be the
[3:06:40] offender, that you would teach me how to
[3:06:44] live a life to hold to accountability
[3:06:49] without being the offender.
[3:06:52] Lord, teach us everyone the language of
[3:06:54] love.
[3:06:56] And may we learn how to build
[3:06:57] relationships before we can speak
[3:06:59] accountability into somebody's life.
[3:07:02] Help us to form strong bonds and build
[3:07:04] bigger families. I pray, Lord, that
[3:07:06] you'll put us so tight together, as
[3:07:08] brother Bram said, that that even a
[3:07:10] razor blade couldn't come in between
[3:07:13] these stones.
[3:07:16] These are lively stones. These are
[3:07:17] living stones.
[3:07:20] And may they be stacked one upon
[3:07:21] another, laying a great foundation and
[3:07:24] building the house of the Lord.
[3:07:27] And may nothing be able to get between
[3:07:29] us.
[3:07:30] May we be so perfectly cut and formed
[3:07:33] and shaped
[3:07:34] that we can be laid upon one another
[3:07:36] without the sound of a hammer
[3:07:39] and build the habitation of the holy God
[3:07:43] &gt;&gt; in a world that's in real trouble. And
[3:07:46] Lord, it is not your will that we follow
[3:07:47] the ways of the world. It's your way
[3:07:49] will that we follow the ways of Christ.
[3:07:52] &gt;&gt; Deliver us from the path of popular
[3:07:54] opinion and peer pressure and may we
[3:07:57] surrender to the fullness of your word.
[3:07:59] Now,
[3:08:03] if you're having a particular problem
[3:08:04] with something like that, let the Lord
[3:08:06] touch you just now.
[3:08:08] And and I know this don't sound good,
[3:08:10] but I got to tell you anyway.
[3:08:14] Try so hard not to defend
[3:08:18] try so hard not to defend yourself and
[3:08:21] be careful how you defend others. We
[3:08:23] should stand up for one another, but be
[3:08:25] careful how you do it
[3:08:28] &gt;&gt; because if you defend someone else in
[3:08:30] the wrong way, you add strength to the
[3:08:31] spirit they are they're under. If indeed
[3:08:33] they are. And that's not accountability.
[3:08:37] &gt;&gt; That's enabling. Lord, I don't want to
[3:08:40] enable anybody to stay where they are. I
[3:08:43] want to provoke everybody to come
[3:08:44] higher. Why don't we ask the Lord to
[3:08:47] help us? Lord, help us right now to be
[3:08:49] provokers. Not not offenders, but
[3:08:52] provokers.
[3:08:53] &gt;&gt; May May there be something seen and
[3:08:55] heard in us, demonstrated, displayed in
[3:08:58] us
[3:08:59] &gt;&gt; that would cause others
[3:09:02] to want to climb a little higher.
[3:09:05] &gt;&gt; And may we find ourselves busy laying
[3:09:08] before you in the secret place.
[3:09:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. so that we don't have time to
[3:09:13] judge the motives of anybody else. We're
[3:09:16] on a journey.
[3:09:18] Lord, may we get up every morning
[3:09:19] singing, "I'm coming up the rough side
[3:09:21] of the mountain, but I'm coming up. I'm
[3:09:22] coming up. I'm coming up because I know
[3:09:24] where you are."
[3:09:26] &gt;&gt; And you said when we could not climb any
[3:09:28] longer. And even after breathing the
[3:09:30] fire, we would only get a maybe almost
[3:09:33] to the top, you said that you would bear
[3:09:36] us to the top on the wings of white
[3:09:39] eagle.
[3:09:41] That's a sweep of your spirit. Brother
[3:09:43] Bam said, "A sweep of your spirit will
[3:09:46] take us right there." Father, if we can
[3:09:48] just endure to that moment, I feel
[3:09:50] strength. I don't know if you're able to
[3:09:53] feel it or not. It's not by feeling, but
[3:09:55] I feel strength here. And and it's a
[3:09:57] supernatural thing. It's not not a
[3:09:59] physical strength. I need some of that.
[3:10:01] Don't you?
[3:10:02] &gt;&gt; But it's something on the inside
[3:10:03] strengthening the inner man that God
[3:10:05] wants to impart to us right now. And and
[3:10:07] I kind of hear I'm hearing something
[3:10:09] that that's that's just provoking us to
[3:10:12] run on to run on to run on
[3:10:16] to not be weary. In fact, I hear him now
[3:10:19] saying, "Be not weary."
[3:10:22] &gt;&gt; As the scripture saith, be not weary in
[3:10:25] welloing. Lord,
[3:10:27] &gt;&gt; run on. Run on. Run on for you'll reap
[3:10:31] in due season if you faint not. And so
[3:10:33] Lord, let our determination uh click in
[3:10:37] us.
[3:10:40] &gt;&gt; And when we open our eyes and we start
[3:10:42] looking around, may we see a light, may
[3:10:44] we see a brightness, may we see
[3:10:46] something changing in one another. If we
[3:10:49] could just see uh there's some who feel
[3:10:53] like they're just not getting anything.
[3:10:56] And maybe they could just catch a
[3:10:57] glimpse of your glory on somebody else.
[3:11:02] It it would just bring a a surrender to
[3:11:04] say, "Lord, I want that glory to be seen
[3:11:06] in me. I want that glory to change me. I
[3:11:11] tell you, I I can see I can see what
[3:11:14] God's doing, and I want to honor him for
[3:11:17] it."
[3:11:18] &gt;&gt; Sing that, Benjamin, as we just worship
[3:11:20] another moment before we go.
[3:11:24] This is the time when trueers
[3:11:30] will worship
[3:11:33] him.
[3:11:33] &gt;&gt; Do what you were born to do. Worship the
[3:11:35] Lord.
[3:11:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, these are the days when my father's
[3:11:41] &gt;&gt; my father's
[3:11:43] ways will be known to me.
[3:11:47] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, this is our desire.
[3:11:51] This is the hour where the spirit's
[3:11:57] power will move
[3:12:00] again
[3:12:02] across
[3:12:03] this land as we worship
[3:12:07] him in spirit.
[3:12:11] And
[3:12:11] &gt;&gt; maybe you just maybe just slip to
[3:12:14] somebody next to you. May maybe sing it
[3:12:17] with them. Maybe just join with them in
[3:12:19] a in a in a way. Maybe stand close or
[3:12:21] touch him on the shoulder.
[3:12:23] &gt;&gt; This is a body thing. We got to do this
[3:12:25] together. We got to go together.
[3:12:27] &gt;&gt; We got to climb together.
[3:12:30] &gt;&gt; Get up there. Will you hear yourself?
[3:12:33] &gt;&gt; These are the days when my father's way
[3:12:40] will be home to me.
[3:12:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. And this is the hour when
[3:12:51] the spirit's
[3:12:53] power will move
[3:12:56] again.
[3:12:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:12:58] &gt;&gt; Across
[3:13:00] this land as we worship
[3:13:04] him.
[3:13:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:13:05] &gt;&gt; In spirit
[3:13:07] and in truth.
[3:13:10] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[3:13:12] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[3:13:15] And this
[3:13:17] is the time when you're standing here
[3:13:21] [Music]
[3:13:22] will worship
[3:13:25] him.
[3:13:29] And these are the days when my father's
[3:13:35] ways will be known to men.
[3:13:43] And this is the hour when the spirit's
[3:13:49] power it will move
[3:13:53] again.
[3:13:54] Oh, cross this land as we worship
[3:14:00] him in spirit
[3:14:04] and in truth.
[3:14:09] [Music]
[3:14:12] And this is the time when trueers
[3:14:17] [Music]
[3:14:19] will worship
[3:14:21] him.
[3:14:26] And these are the days when my father's
[3:14:32] ways will be known to me.
[3:14:38] [Music]
[3:14:40] And this is the hour when the spirit's
[3:14:46] power will move
[3:14:49] again
[3:14:51] across
[3:14:53] this land. Oh, as we worship
[3:14:56] him
[3:14:58] in spirit
[3:15:00] and in truth.
[3:15:08] And this is the time when trueers
[3:15:14] [Music]
[3:15:16] will worship
[3:15:18] him.
[3:15:19] [Music]
[3:15:22] &gt;&gt; And these are the days when my father's
[3:15:29] ways will be known
[3:15:32] to me.
[3:15:37] And this is the hour when the spirit's
[3:15:43] power will move again
[3:15:48] across
[3:15:50] this land as we worship
[3:15:54] him in spirit
[3:15:58] and in truth.
[3:16:03] In your presence,
[3:16:09] that's where I belong. When I walked
[3:16:12] away, I heard you say in your pray for a
[3:16:14] reason. She must know. She must
[3:16:19] God.
[3:16:20] &gt;&gt; You have to in your pray that it has
[3:16:23] opened for a reason
[3:16:24] &gt;&gt; and that God is going to get
[3:16:28] strong for his name. Seeking I saw
[3:16:31] beauty for ashes
[3:16:34] &gt;&gt; trusting your glory.
[3:16:36] &gt;&gt; I saw silver
[3:16:38] &gt;&gt; for redemption
[3:16:39] &gt;&gt; in the cleft of the rock.
[3:16:42] &gt;&gt; What has been lost?
[3:16:44] &gt;&gt; Give her strength to get above every bit
[3:16:46] of it
[3:16:47] &gt;&gt; in your presence. Let deliverance
[3:16:50] &gt;&gt; break forth in her inner being
[3:16:52] &gt;&gt; in your push out
[3:16:55] &gt;&gt; pushing away all the wound
[3:16:58] &gt;&gt; that's all the hurt
[3:17:01] in your presence
[3:17:02] &gt;&gt; may the pattern be broken the cycle be
[3:17:05] broken
[3:17:05] &gt;&gt; oh Lord the repeated cycle be in your
[3:17:09] presence
[3:17:12] &gt;&gt; bad choices that get bad results may
[3:17:14] that be broken off of her life
[3:17:17] &gt;&gt; seek
[3:17:18] It was a generational thing and we break
[3:17:21] that law
[3:17:22] &gt;&gt; in the authority of Jesus Christ. The
[3:17:26] cycle we break it. We come against it in
[3:17:29] the name of Jesus. Your word like a
[3:17:32] sword goes to the cycle.
[3:17:36] We ask Lord
[3:17:38] &gt;&gt; for better choice, better decisions,
[3:17:41] &gt;&gt; wiser steps
[3:17:44] &gt;&gt; that bring godly results
[3:17:47] in your presence. Redeem, redeem,
[3:17:50] redeem, redeem, redeem. Lord, my God, in
[3:17:55] your presence,
[3:17:58] &gt;&gt; it's him we need.
[3:17:59] &gt;&gt; That's where I
[3:18:00] &gt;&gt; It's the Lord we need.
[3:18:03] seeking your face.
[3:18:05] &gt;&gt; We don't need bad people.
[3:18:09] &gt;&gt; We don't need relationships with those
[3:18:11] who will only destroy us
[3:18:15] relationships.
[3:18:16] &gt;&gt; We need him
[3:18:19] in your presence.
[3:18:21] Oh God,
[3:18:22] &gt;&gt; sing it again.
[3:18:24] &gt;&gt; In your presence.
[3:18:29] That's where I am strong. In your
[3:18:33] presence
[3:18:38] my God here in your praise
[3:18:43] circuits.
[3:18:45] &gt;&gt; That's where I belong.
[3:18:48] Seeking your face,
[3:18:52] touching your grace.
[3:18:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, let the weak say I'm strong.
[3:18:57] &gt;&gt; In the cleft of the rock.
[3:19:00] &gt;&gt; Let the poor say I'm rich.
[3:19:02] Let the sick say, "I'm whole."
[3:19:04] &gt;&gt; In your presence, oh God.
[3:19:09] &gt;&gt; In your presence,
[3:19:15] that's where I
[3:19:18] &gt;&gt; in your presence.
[3:19:22] Oh Lord my God.
[3:19:24] &gt;&gt; In your
[3:19:25] &gt;&gt; in your presence.
[3:19:30] That's where I am strong. When I'm
[3:19:34] seeking your face,
[3:19:36] &gt;&gt; I'm touching
[3:19:37] &gt;&gt; touching your grace
[3:19:40] &gt;&gt; in the cliff of the rock. In the cliff
[3:19:44] of the rock,
[3:19:48] in your presence,
[3:19:50] &gt;&gt; in your presence,
[3:19:52] oh God,
[3:19:54] &gt;&gt; in your presence, Lord, you are the
[3:19:56] glory
[3:19:57] &gt;&gt; and the lifter of our heads.
[3:20:01] You are the shoulder that we lean on in
[3:20:06] times of distress.
[3:20:10] We pray what you gave us for our sister.
[3:20:15] We just want that to be released over
[3:20:17] the whole house that every cycle, every
[3:20:20] circuit would be broken, that
[3:20:23] &gt;&gt; that that bad decision that gets bad
[3:20:26] results. We just ask Lord that your
[3:20:29] light would turn on that for every one
[3:20:30] of us. That we would get out of that
[3:20:33] perpetual gerbble wheel of running the
[3:20:36] same thing over and over again when
[3:20:38] you've got a whole land. the w the land
[3:20:40] is wide. The promises for the bride,
[3:20:43] it's a broad place and we we just resist
[3:20:45] confinement in this hour. We resist
[3:20:48] restraint and boundaries that are not
[3:20:50] godly. And we want to stretch ourselves
[3:20:52] into the fullness of the promise that
[3:20:54] you have for us. So right now, we just
[3:20:57] ask for the wisdom I mean the wisdom of
[3:20:59] the Lord.
[3:21:01] &gt;&gt; Father, would you just put it put it in
[3:21:05] us? the wisdom, the the the the
[3:21:08] sevenfold spirit of the Lord. Part of
[3:21:10] that is the spirit of wisdom. Lord, let
[3:21:12] that wisdom be birthed in us today that
[3:21:16] we would make better choices because we
[3:21:18] want to see God results.
[3:21:20] &gt;&gt; So, we've got to make God-led choices.
[3:21:22] Help us to do that. Uh no unsanctified
[3:21:25] mercy.
[3:21:26] [Music]
[3:21:28] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[3:21:29] &gt;&gt; Lord. Reveal the root of unsanctified
[3:21:31] mercy in us. It is not your mercy when
[3:21:34] we give it in an unsanctified manner.
[3:21:37] When we let people off the hook and
[3:21:39] don't don't hold them accountable, it's
[3:21:41] often because of unsanctified mercy. We
[3:21:44] want the mercy of God and the grace of
[3:21:46] God. We want that's what we want to
[3:21:48] show. That's what we want to live under.
[3:21:50] And that's what we want to show one
[3:21:51] another. The grace of God. Oh, it's
[3:21:53] rich. It's boundless. It's endless.
[3:21:56] &gt;&gt; But it it doesn't support the wrong. It
[3:22:00] doesn't
[3:22:01] &gt;&gt; it it it doesn't pet the wrong. It calls
[3:22:03] into accountability
[3:22:05] the righteous seed of God.
[3:22:07] We just surrender. As we leave here
[3:22:09] today, may we go here with a refresh.
[3:22:11] Our bodies are tired of sitting here so
[3:22:13] long, but may we leave with a something
[3:22:15] in our spirit that that's just pulsing
[3:22:18] with life.
[3:22:19] &gt;&gt; Let the life of the word pulse in us.
[3:22:22] Hallelujah. May we hear the heartbeat of
[3:22:25] God.
[3:22:26] &gt;&gt; What is he thinking? What's on his mind?
[3:22:28] what's on his heart today. Lord, that's
[3:22:31] what I want to carry with me out of this
[3:22:32] house.
[3:22:35] Lord, would you heal the sick, not only
[3:22:37] among us, but those who were not able to
[3:22:38] be here today. Let healing break out.
[3:22:40] It's the children's bread. You are still
[3:22:43] Yahweh Rafa,
[3:22:45] &gt;&gt; and you're more than able to heal. Bless
[3:22:48] these sweet little babies you've sent
[3:22:49] this way.
[3:22:51] &gt;&gt; We give you praise and glory for it.
[3:22:53] It's in the name of Jesus Christ, the
[3:22:55] precious Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[3:22:58] Amen. And if you feel comfortable to do
[3:22:59] so, why don't you just greet one
[3:23:01] another, hug one another? You're
[3:23:04] dismissed to go in the lovely name of
[3:23:06] the Lord in your
[3:23:08] presence.
