[0:37] praise the Lord I'm Pastor Steven Shelly
[0:39] and you're watching the eagle cry I'm
[0:42] coming to you from the sanctuary of the
[0:45] New Hope Revival Center uh we call our
[0:48] ministry New Hope Revival ministries and
[0:51] this is the sanctuary of our church in
[0:54] Smith Station Alabama well I know you're
[0:57] watching all across Europe and Asia even
[1:00] the Middle East or you may be streaming
[1:02] this on on this fine Christian Network
[1:05] right on your computer in North America
[1:08] or South America I don't know where you
[1:10] are but you probably don't know where
[1:12] Smith Station Alabama is it's just a
[1:15] small uh community in Alabama uh we're
[1:19] about an hour and 20 minutes away from
[1:22] Atlanta Georgia one one of the busiest
[1:24] airports in the United States so uh
[1:27] we're not so far out in the wild
[1:29] Wilderness that we can't be found and
[1:31] that we can't get to society we're
[1:34] between two uh fairly large uh areas one
[1:39] is Columbus Georgia and one is the opala
[1:42] Auburn Alabama area two two communities
[1:46] that kind of join together and uh I was
[1:50] raised in Columbus Georgia uh just a few
[1:53] miles from here although we're just
[1:55] across the border in Alabama now and uh
[1:59] I live away from here a couple times
[2:02] once in South Carolina but most of the
[2:05] time I've lived right here in this area
[2:09] and uh it seems like this is where God
[2:11] has planted us we do have a Prayer
[2:13] Ministry in Jerusalem Israel and uh
[2:17] we're there when we can be I travel uh
[2:21] some of you can find information about
[2:23] that on the uh internet on our website
[2:26] that information is given to you on the
[2:29] screen there's all kinds of information
[2:31] about our ministry there some resources
[2:34] that might be a blessing to you so be
[2:36] sure to check that out uh I like to
[2:39] travel I enjoy speaking at conferences
[2:42] and camp meetings around the world but I
[2:45] also like being at home I like preaching
[2:48] to this
[2:49] congregation uh we are on a piece of
[2:52] property here that the Lord is given us
[2:55] we've named this property under the
[2:57] inspiration of the Holy Spirit Eagles
[2:59] Refuge Holiness
[3:01] Campground and uh there we have a couple
[3:05] of buildings here used for prayer prayer
[3:07] chapel and our Sanctuary is here we have
[3:10] an an office here where we send out
[3:14] material all over the world CDs and DVDs
[3:19] and all kinds of good things that would
[3:21] be a blessing to you in your life so you
[3:24] check that out we also receive prayer
[3:26] requests here at our ministry and we
[3:29] take it serious because I believe in the
[3:32] power of prayer I know that Prayer
[3:34] Changes Things and so if you have a
[3:37] prayer request that you'd like to share
[3:39] with us I can assure you that I will
[3:42] pray and I know that others will because
[3:44] we often share them with with folk
[3:47] around here and they pray uh over your
[3:50] needs as well but when I get one when it
[3:53] comes into the website I see it
[3:55] immediately and I begin to pray and uh I
[3:59] just believe and in fact sometime before
[4:01] we ever can answer to say that we're
[4:04] praying they've already written back to
[4:06] say that God is ministered to them and
[4:09] met the need so if we could help you in
[4:11] some way through prayer well that would
[4:14] be a blessing we can't always do what we
[4:17] would like to do for people but there's
[4:19] one thing we can do and that is pray and
[4:23] why don't you commit perhaps to also
[4:26] pray for us that we would continue to do
[4:29] what what God has called us to do and
[4:31] also while you're praying pray for this
[4:35] great Christian Network that God will
[4:38] use this ministry and expand it into the
[4:42] farthest reaches of this world still
[4:46] there are areas that we're not yet
[4:48] reaching but God is giving Vision to the
[4:51] Great Men Who lead these networks he's
[4:55] giving them vision and Direction and
[4:58] making provision and if you can be a
[5:00] part of that provision you feel free to
[5:04] sew into the ministry of these
[5:06] television networks where you're
[5:08] watching this broadcast because I want
[5:11] to see them not only survive but I want
[5:14] to see them expand and you know there's
[5:17] a lot of uh ugliness on the internet and
[5:20] it's being used for evil things but I
[5:23] want to thank God that it's also being
[5:26] used to spread the gospel of the Lord
[5:29] Jesus Jesus Christ in fact some of you
[5:31] are watching this broadcast uh through
[5:35] your network but right on your own
[5:38] computer or perhaps even your smartphone
[5:41] or an iPad or tablet and I want to thank
[5:44] God for that because it's just another
[5:47] great way of getting the message to you
[5:51] wherever you are and that's a privilege
[5:53] and a pleasure to be able to do that we
[5:56] are studying together the spirit and
[6:00] power of Elijah we're looking at the
[6:03] spirit and power of Elijah in the past
[6:07] in the present and in the future and
[6:10] we're trying to examine what it is about
[6:14] the anointing that was on the Prophet
[6:16] Elijah that would be so important and so
[6:20] significant in the mind of God that he
[6:23] would determin not only to send it once
[6:26] but to send it and resend into the Earth
[6:30] and each time the spirit and power of
[6:33] Elijah would show up in the earth it has
[6:38] uh caused a tremendous shift in the
[6:41] realm of the spirit it has moved a lot
[6:44] of things that needed to be moved and it
[6:47] has helped to prepare the hearts of
[6:49] people to receive the revelation of the
[6:53] Lord Jesus Christ and I'm excited about
[6:56] that now if we're going to be able to
[6:58] determine those other visitations of the
[7:02] spirit and power of Elijah it would be a
[7:05] good starting place to find out a little
[7:08] bit about the Elijah that we read about
[7:12] in The Book of kings in the scripture
[7:15] but before we do let me remind you of
[7:18] our theme scripture for this study
[7:21] Malachi 4 5 and 6 behold I will send you
[7:25] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[7:28] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[7:31] and he shall turn the heart of the
[7:34] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[7:37] the children to their fathers lest I
[7:41] come and smite the Earth with a curse
[7:45] there's something about the spirit and
[7:48] the power of Elijah that would have such
[7:52] a redeeming effect in the earth that it
[7:56] would cancel the need for the smiting of
[8:01] the Earth with a curse did you follow
[8:04] that had it not been for the coming of
[8:08] the spirit and power of Elijah the Earth
[8:12] would have fallen under a tremendous
[8:15] curse and so we know that this anointing
[8:19] was on Elijah it was also on that dear
[8:23] man who received a double portion
[8:26] Elisha it was also on John the Baptist
[8:31] later we're going to look out the
[8:33] possibility that it has come at the end
[8:36] of the Leo Dean Church age and we're
[8:40] believing that it is returning again in
[8:44] a corporate body of people and there
[8:47] will yet be another return uh in in what
[8:51] we have called the two witnesses or the
[8:54] two Olive branches of the Prophet
[8:58] Zachariah those that he spoke about and
[9:01] each time the Earth was positioned
[9:04] evidently for a for a curse the Striking
[9:08] of the earth a judgment upon the Earth
[9:10] but because the spirit and power of
[9:13] Elijah came into the Earth it pushed
[9:17] that curse upon the Earth farther out in
[9:21] in history and so it is coming uh we
[9:25] know by the scripture that there will be
[9:28] a day uh of of judgment upon the Earth
[9:31] we're we're seeing measures of judgments
[9:35] but a lot of times what we're calling
[9:37] judgments now are really acts of Mercy
[9:41] where God is just trying to get our
[9:43] attention to show us that there's never
[9:46] been a more important hour to be sincere
[9:49] before him and sometimes we have to be
[9:52] shaken a little bit the New Testament
[9:54] tells us that everything that can be
[9:57] shaken will be shaken so that God can
[10:02] see which Remains What will remain and
[10:06] what will be shaken off you see there's
[10:09] a lot of of people who follow uh
[10:12] Christianity with a pretense or with a
[10:16] facade you know they put on some kind of
[10:20] um I don't know almost like a mask
[10:22] really because they identify themselves
[10:25] as Christian because they're not wanting
[10:28] to be identified
[10:29] by some other Faith but I'm not talking
[10:32] about just someone who says I was born a
[10:35] Christian this is something that's often
[10:38] said in the far reaches of the earth
[10:40] meaning I was not born this or not born
[10:43] that or born the other I was born a
[10:45] Christian but I want you to know uh from
[10:48] my heart that God doesn't have any
[10:51] grandchildren and so you can't be uh
[10:54] born you can be born into a Christian
[10:56] family but you can't be born a Christian
[10:59] what makes you a Christian is not the
[11:01] family you're born into but what makes
[11:04] you a Christian is to be Christlike and
[11:07] you can't be like Christ without having
[11:11] experienced the power of the holy spirit
[11:14] in your life the regenerative and
[11:17] Redemptive work of the Cross what the
[11:19] blood of Jesus Christ can do for us it
[11:23] not only covers our sin it remits them
[11:26] as though we had never sinned and it
[11:29] does doesn't stop there it sets us free
[11:32] from the power of sin and death that's
[11:35] what the precious blood of Jesus does so
[11:38] that sin no longer has dominion over our
[11:41] lives now that doesn't mean that we
[11:44] might not fail God at some point or that
[11:46] we might not fall into sin it happens
[11:49] but sin does not have dominion over our
[11:52] lives because we have been washed we
[11:56] have been redeemed by the blood of the
[11:58] Lamb when we we fail when we make
[12:00] mistakes when we sin not willfully but
[12:04] we end up in in a sinful situation we
[12:07] just come to God and we say I'm your
[12:10] child I have failed you I have turned my
[12:14] back
[12:15] temporarily uh I've had a a lapse of
[12:17] good judgment and I've done some things
[12:20] that I'm ashamed of I ask you to come in
[12:23] right now and wash me with your blood
[12:25] and forgive me and Lord I need to be
[12:27] free from that I want to make that same
[12:30] mistake again you know you can learn
[12:32] from your mistakes if you'll just take
[12:35] the time to consider who you are the
[12:38] price that has been paid for you and how
[12:41] he must have loved you oh how he must
[12:44] have loved you to pay the price that he
[12:47] did to redeem you to himself no greater
[12:50] love story I don't know of any greater
[12:54] love story than the one I'm talking
[12:56] about right now that God loved you so
[12:58] much came in the likeness of sinful
[13:01] flesh so that he could suffer pay the
[13:05] price shed the token of his blood and
[13:08] then with Grace get that blood to you
[13:11] you know uh that blood went into the
[13:14] ground and and it's not necessary to go
[13:17] and dig that up with a shovel or a spoon
[13:20] and say I need that blood on me but the
[13:23] life that was in that blood is available
[13:26] to you right now and God used uses the
[13:29] vehicle of Grace he uses the vehicle of
[13:33] Grace to transport the life that was in
[13:36] that blood to your life where you are
[13:40] you don't have to go to Jerusalem to
[13:42] come in contact with that blood because
[13:44] Grace is like a truck it brings the
[13:48] blood the power of the blood the life
[13:51] that was in that blood it brings it
[13:53] right to your doorstep if you invite it
[13:56] if you ask him to come with his grace
[13:59] and with his blood and save you and
[14:01] redeem you he can do that oh my if you
[14:05] haven't done that uh don't wait and
[14:08] until I don't know what you would wait
[14:09] on uh um maybe Sunday to get to a church
[14:13] somewhere or till you can call your
[14:15] neighbor don't wait don't put it off
[14:18] call on him right now and there will be
[14:20] a truckload of Grace headed your way to
[14:23] wash you clean to redeem you to set you
[14:26] free I want us to move on in this now
[14:29] I want us to talk about the
[14:31] characteristics of the Elijah that
[14:35] Prophet whose name was Elijah and what
[14:40] uh what characteristics what attributes
[14:43] we can identify in his life so that we
[14:47] can uh examine history and and see
[14:53] perhaps the times that that anointing
[14:56] that spirit and power returned to the
[14:58] Earth and so we can know what to look
[15:00] for also in the future so let's talk
[15:03] about the nature of Elijah his
[15:06] characteristics and I want to say number
[15:09] one he was a man of the Wilderness he
[15:13] wasn't a city slicker do you know what I
[15:15] mean he liked the Wilderness he had
[15:18] communion with God in the wilderness now
[15:22] I admit that when I read the
[15:24] descriptions of Elijah in the book of
[15:27] Kings uh he he was a bit rough around
[15:30] the edges he didn't come in a threepiece
[15:34] suit he didn't come in what we would
[15:36] call Sunday best uh he was often uh
[15:41] living in the mountain in the caves in
[15:43] the wilderness and and we know that but
[15:47] he also was a man who heard from God and
[15:52] in order to hear from God he had to
[15:55] separate himself from the noise of
[15:58] others
[15:59] and that is nothing but the truth life
[16:02] is noisy and life is busy and if you
[16:05] want to hear from God there are times
[16:08] that you might have to make a Wilderness
[16:11] you might have to pull aside now it
[16:13] might not be in the woods it might not
[16:15] be out in the field or in the desert you
[16:17] might have to do it in your own
[16:19] apartment or your own flat or wherever
[16:22] you live you might have to make that
[16:24] your Wilderness you may have to just
[16:26] pull in sometime and and and and you
[16:29] know turn the television off not yet but
[16:32] uh turn the television off and just wait
[16:35] on the Lord read the word pray and
[16:38] worship him you know you don't have to
[16:40] be in church with a band with a piano
[16:43] and guitar to worship God you can
[16:45] worship him right now in your home
[16:49] wherever you are your place of business
[16:51] you can just worship Him and love on him
[16:54] and tell him how much he means to you in
[16:57] your life and God can speak to you there
[17:00] in your in your Solitude I believe the
[17:03] life of Elijah the separation of his
[17:07] life the fact that he lived most of it
[17:09] away from the crowd speaks of intimacy
[17:13] it speaks of the fact that he learned
[17:15] how to slow down and hear from the Lord
[17:18] he pulled away from the hustle and
[17:20] bustle and the clanging of all the other
[17:23] voices to hear the one who is most
[17:26] important and that voice that is most
[17:29] important in our life is not necessarily
[17:33] the loudest Voice or the showest voice
[17:37] but it is the one that is often small
[17:40] and still we read that about Elijah uh
[17:45] that he had this experience with the
[17:48] Lord where God came to him in a still
[17:52] Small Voice we're often looking for God
[17:55] to to come in a demonstration of of
[17:59] earthquake and fire and wind and storms
[18:03] and uh we're we're waiting to hear God
[18:06] speaking in all of that and sometimes
[18:08] all that does is distract us and if
[18:11] we're willing and patient if we're
[18:13] willing to wait around until the noise
[18:16] of the hurricane and the earthquake and
[18:19] the fire has settled down then often
[18:23] times after that comes the still small
[18:27] voice of the Lord Lord giving us
[18:30] instruction giving us
[18:32] encouragement uh lifting us up when
[18:35] we're down and and giving us you know
[18:38] some instruction for what we need to do
[18:40] next while ministering Grace and
[18:43] strength and healing and hope why don't
[18:47] you allow the Lord to minister some hope
[18:51] to you maybe you're facing a hopeless
[18:54] situation you think it appears that way
[18:58] and and maybe you've even confessed that
[19:00] with your mouth I'm hopeless this is
[19:04] hopeless my loved one is hopeless my job
[19:08] situation is hopeless my living
[19:11] arrangements are hopeless but I want you
[19:14] to know that as children of God it is
[19:17] necessary that we take hope that we have
[19:21] hope when there is no reason to hope the
[19:24] Bible calls that hoping against hope and
[19:28] in that moment when all of our
[19:30] circumstances would say huh give up
[19:33] there's no reason to keep going in that
[19:36] moment when we feel most desperate when
[19:39] we are in despair when we're so
[19:43] discouraged and uh you know I've been
[19:46] there I've been there and anyone who has
[19:48] served the Lord for any amount of time
[19:51] has been in that place and and and I'm
[19:53] I'm ashamed I'm ashamed that I've
[19:56] allowed myself to get there but I did
[19:59] and so I've got to make the best of that
[20:01] now that's that's in the past so how I'm
[20:04] making the best of that is to share with
[20:06] you and to let you know I've been there
[20:09] I've been through that moment of Despair
[20:12] and Desperation when it looked like the
[20:14] best thing I could do for everybody
[20:16] around me would be just lay down and
[20:18] wait on the Lord to take me you know
[20:20] wait on God to just or starve to death
[20:22] or whatever because I didn't have the uh
[20:25] the unction the strength to get up and
[20:26] do what needed to be done I mean that's
[20:29] a low place but in that Darkest Hour in
[20:33] that hopeless moment there's something
[20:37] about the what God has placed in US it
[20:40] gets pushed down with all the
[20:43] hopelessness and the discouragement but
[20:46] it it it it doesn't leave us it's there
[20:49] and somehow by the spirit of God we're
[20:51] able to make contact with that little
[20:54] seed of hope that's been planted in us
[20:56] that that that portion of faith that has
[20:59] been swn into our lives and we start
[21:02] pulling ourselves out sometimes it comes
[21:05] by the encouragement of a friend or
[21:07] someone who prays or someone who reaches
[21:09] out to us but quite often in that moment
[21:13] we have isolated ourselves we have
[21:15] separated ourselves from friends we
[21:17] don't really want to hear their
[21:19] encouragement you can get that low that
[21:22] you don't even want to be encouraged and
[21:24] so in that alone moment of isolation uh
[21:28] you you got to reach within and you've
[21:30] got to find that hope that the Lord
[21:32] Jesus has placed in Us by his spirit and
[21:36] you've got to begin to pull yourself out
[21:39] of that pit of despair I'm speaking to
[21:42] someone right now that has everything
[21:44] you need to get out of that pit it's in
[21:47] you right now I want to speak to that
[21:49] part of you and I want to tell you that
[21:52] you are not going down in Ultimate
[21:55] defeat because greater is he that that
[21:58] is in you than he that is in the world
[22:01] you just need a little bit of that
[22:03] spirit and power of Elijah to fall on
[22:05] you you just need some courage restored
[22:09] and some fellowship renewed between you
[22:12] and the one who loves you more than you
[22:14] could ever understand yet you know I
[22:17] believe one day we will understand we
[22:20] will know as we are known and we'll as
[22:24] the old Hymn of the church will
[22:26] understand it better by and by and I
[22:29] think if we should have a question the
[22:31] answer will be there but until that
[22:33] moment we can't really fathom the the
[22:37] depth of his love for us we just have to
[22:41] trust in it and uh there's a song that
[22:44] says I I think this is the way the words
[22:47] go if Grace were an ocean then I'm
[22:51] sinking and you know that's the only
[22:53] ocean you want to sink in you don't want
[22:56] to sink in the ocean of Des spare or in
[22:59] the ocean of of giving up ultimate uh
[23:03] giving up I I can't go on but if Grace
[23:06] is an ocean then that is an ocean that
[23:09] you can sink in that is an ocean that
[23:12] you can be overwhelmed in and you know
[23:14] what I believe that's how his love and
[23:16] grace is it surrounds us even in those
[23:19] moments when Satan does everything he
[23:23] can to break our fellowship with God
[23:26] he's so jealous of you and your walk
[23:29] with God that he does everything he can
[23:32] to make you feel unloved by God or
[23:35] separated from his Fellowship but don't
[23:37] you allow that to happen uh I want you
[23:40] to understand the difference between
[23:42] pulling aside to hear from the Lord and
[23:46] isolating yourselves because of what
[23:49] you're going through it's it's a
[23:51] different situation all together and I
[23:53] don't encourage you to go into the cave
[23:56] when you're depressed I encourage
[23:58] encourage you to go against that and and
[24:01] find someone who can talk to you and who
[24:04] can be a friend to you uh because I
[24:07] believe if you go into the cave or Into
[24:09] the Wilderness in that moment you might
[24:12] be overwhelmed you might face Temptation
[24:15] that you don't seem to be able to find
[24:17] the way around but once you have come
[24:20] through that place of Despair and that
[24:23] place of hopelessness and you want to
[24:25] draw close to the lord it's in that
[24:27] moment that you want to pull away miss a
[24:30] meal you know uh start out if you've
[24:33] never fasted start out with something
[24:35] that you really enjoy eating and say I'm
[24:38] not going to have that you know you
[24:40] could say I'm not going to have sugar
[24:43] I'm going to lay that aside I'm going to
[24:45] I'm going to lay aside dessert I'm going
[24:47] to lay aside whatever it is that you
[24:49] enjoy and and then work your way into a
[24:53] fast uh where you just want to hear the
[24:56] voice of God where you maybe say I'll
[24:59] I'll just have juice I'll just drink
[25:01] some vegetable juice or or however you
[25:03] purpose in your heart I'm not here to
[25:05] tell you how but I do want to give you
[25:07] some practical ideas wait until you're
[25:10] out from under the load of
[25:12] discouragement before you pull it way uh
[25:15] because when Elijah uh was alone in his
[25:19] in his defeated moments uh it caused him
[25:23] some trouble we'll talk about that as we
[25:26] go along but the Bible tells us in one
[25:28] place that Elijah was down by the Brook
[25:31] cherith and we'll talk about that that
[25:34] was in first Kings chapter 17 verse one
[25:37] and that Brook cherith is uh the meaning
[25:41] of that is a place of Separation a place
[25:45] to be stretched a place to be challenged
[25:49] a place to be developed perhaps God's
[25:52] calling you right now to your Brook
[25:55] cherith a separating he's call calling
[25:58] you to hear his voice he's calling you
[26:01] to stretch you a little bit because he
[26:04] wants to pour more of himself into your
[26:06] life and in order to do to do that he
[26:09] has to expand your capacity a little bit
[26:12] for him you know I don't mind being
[26:14] stretched if I know that he's going to
[26:16] fill up that new place in me with
[26:19] himself father I ask you right now as
[26:23] you stretch us as you challenge us I ask
[26:27] that you will fill us us with more of
[26:30] you more love more power more strength I
[26:34] pray right now that in a confused and
[26:37] troubled mind you will bring a sound
[26:40] mind I pray right now for those in
[26:43] hopelessness that you will break them
[26:46] out of the prison of hopelessness and
[26:50] put your finger upon their life in such
[26:53] a manner that Hope Springs up upon them
[26:57] again Hallelujah and that you'll open up
[27:00] a well within them I hear the spirit
[27:02] saying spring up a well and I'm asking
[27:06] that the Lord would allow that well of
[27:08] Grace and strength and power to spring
[27:11] up in you in the mighty name of the Lord
[27:14] Jesus Christ oh my I feel his presence I
[27:18] hope and trust that you do if we can
