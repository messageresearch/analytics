[0:00] you know there are times that it can be
[0:02] incredibly difficult to get our mind
[0:05] around the magnitude of God's love the
[0:09] father's love for us the scriptures are
[0:13] clear for instance first John chapter 3
[0:16] verse 1 in the amplified version says
[0:19] see what an incredible quality of love
[0:23] the father has given shown bestowed on
[0:28] us that we should be permitted to be
[0:32] named and called and counted the
[0:36] children of God and so we are the reason
[0:40] that the world does not know recognize
[0:43] and acknowledge us is that it does not
[0:46] know recognize or acknowledge him in
[0:50] verse 2 it says beloved we are even here
[0:55] and now God's children sons of God it is
[1:00] not yet disclosed or made clear what we
[1:03] shall be Hereafter
[1:05] but we know that when he comes and is
[1:07] manifested we shall as God's children
[1:10] resemble and be like him for we shall
[1:14] see him just as he really is you know
[1:20] the Bible talks about sonship it's a
[1:23] very important part of what God is doing
[1:25] in his Bridal body in this hour there's
[1:30] a spirit of adoption that's working in
[1:33] the sons of God to bring us to a place
[1:36] of maturity that we can truly
[1:39] participate with Christ in his plan of
[1:42] redemption for planet Earth
[1:45] the bride is moving into a place where
[1:49] she knows the Father's heart she knows
[1:52] the will of God and she moves in divine
[1:56] synchronization with his plan with his
[2:00] will I remember as a boy
[2:03] agonizing for days weeks sometimes
[2:07] months to try to discover
[2:10] God's will in a particular situation I
[2:13] believe that's what we must do until
[2:16] there's something else to do but I truly
[2:19] believe that we're coming into an hour
[2:21] where as we continue to bring our
[2:24] thoughts under subjection to the Word of
[2:27] God that we will begin to know and to
[2:31] discern the will of our Heavenly Father
[2:33] I'm not saying that there won't be a
[2:36] need for prayer and intercession there
[2:38] absolutely will always be a need for
[2:40] prayer for intercession or fasting
[2:43] setting ourselves apart to know God but
[2:46] I truly believe there's a union and a
[2:49] oneness that's coming and not just for a
[2:52] spiritually elite pastor prophet leader
[2:56] teacher but for you as an individual the
[3:00] Bible says but as many as are led by the
[3:04] Spirit of God they are the sons of God
[3:08] all sons do not come to maturity at the
[3:12] same time at the same point you see the
[3:16] body of Christ is a many membered body
[3:20] it's a living moving breathing organism
[3:23] and I am a part of that body and I trust
[3:28] that you now know by the revelation of
[3:31] the spirit that you also are a part of
[3:34] that body the Bible tells us here in 1st
[3:39] Corinthians chapter 12 12 for even as
[3:42] the body is one and yet has many members
[3:44] and all the members of the body though
[3:47] they are many are one body so also is
[3:51] Christ there's a union that takes place
[3:55] as we receive deeper realms of
[3:59] Revelation from the Word of God it's not
[4:02] by our experience alone that we grow
[4:05] it's by revelation from the Word of God
[4:09] I believe that most of us have heard
[4:12] enough preaching to move us way beyond
[4:16] the levels of perfection and into the
[4:18] stature of a perfect man but that word
[4:21] of God that's been planted in us it has
[4:24] to be quickened and made alive by a
[4:27] spirit of understanding by spirit of
[4:29] Revelation and I believe the bride is
[4:31] calling out for that in this hour
[4:34] don't you dare disqualify yourself
[4:37] because I believe that it that calling
[4:40] and wooing and drawing that you
[4:42] experienced in the in the womb of your
[4:44] spirit we say on the inside of the
[4:48] inside that deep calling to the deep
[4:50] sometimes we even refer to it as a
[4:53] divine dissatisfaction or a divine
[4:56] frustration it's not with the Lord that
[4:59] we become frustrated it's with ourselves
[5:01] it's with our ability to yield but I
[5:05] want you to know this is this is a
[5:07] victory that's one minute by minute it's
[5:11] not a victory perhaps one once and for
[5:13] all
[5:14] but it's daily finding a place in him
[5:18] daily allowing his word to be formed the
[5:23] very nature and life of Jesus Christ to
[5:26] be formed on the inside of who we are
[5:30] the Bible tells us in Hebrews chapter 2
[5:34] and verse 10 for it was an act worthy of
[5:38] God and fitting to the divine nature
[5:41] that he for whose sake and by whom all
[5:45] things have their existence in bringing
[5:48] many sons into glory should make the
[5:52] pioneer of their salvation perfect
[5:54] should bring to maturity the human
[5:57] experience necessary to be perfected
[5:59] equipped for his office as high priest
[6:02] through suffering there's a lot of words
[6:04] in those two verses of Scripture but the
[6:07] truth that we need to pull from that is
[6:09] Jesus was the firstfruits of many sons
[6:13] of many brethren there's a move of the
[6:17] Spirit of God going on in this hour
[6:20] to bring us into that place you see it's
[6:24] vitally important in this hour
[6:26] that we begin to see ourselves as
[6:29] participants in what the Lord is about
[6:32] to do on planet Earth
[6:34] Hebrews 3:14 says for we are made
[6:37] partakers of Christ if we hold the
[6:41] beginning of our confidence steadfast in
[6:44] the Lord the amplified says for we have
[6:47] become fellows with Christ that word is
[6:51] sometimes translated companions
[6:54] participants or partners can you imagine
[6:57] that you have been chosen to be a
[7:00] partner a participant with Christ in his
[7:03] plan of redemption in the end time
[7:06] that's where we are right now we have
[7:11] become fellows with Christ the Messiah
[7:13] and share in all he has for us if only
[7:17] we hold our first newborn confidence and
[7:21] original assured expectation in virtue
[7:25] of which we are believers firm and
[7:27] unshaken to the end that's the key
[7:31] we cannot be easily shaken by the
[7:35] circumstances of our life it's possible
[7:38] that many of us are not really seeing
[7:40] our individual part in what God desires
[7:45] to do in this hour perhaps we sit in a
[7:48] service and we hear the word of God we
[7:51] recognize that it is rich and that it is
[7:54] timely and maybe we look around the
[7:56] congregation and we see all of those
[7:59] that we feel like it applies to these
[8:02] are the ones that God is bringing to
[8:05] maturity while I just sit here on the
[8:07] Pew but I want you to know that that is
[8:10] most likely not the case at all it's
[8:13] very very important for you to
[8:15] understand that you cannot always
[8:18] recognize the inner working of God in
[8:21] your life until it begins to manifest
[8:24] one of the ways that I notice when God
[8:28] is working on my life or when the word
[8:30] is working in my life is when I noticed
[8:33] that my reactions begin to change same
[8:37] circumstances familiar situations but on
[8:41] the inside of me there is a different
[8:43] reaction perhaps my words are different
[8:46] my emotions are different in fact I
[8:49] began to to move as the word says that a
[8:53] believer that a son of God should move
[8:56] and when I see that even in the smallest
[8:58] thing I celebrate it I may do it alone
[9:02] I may do it in the privacy of my own
[9:04] office but I just say Lord I want to
[9:07] thank you that you are giving me victory
[9:10] the circumstances of our lives there
[9:15] lessons learned every Hill every tunnel
[9:19] every Valley all of it a part of God
[9:23] positioning us for this hour so that we
[9:27] can be totally dependent on him the more
[9:31] dependent we become on the Lord the more
[9:36] of his life is manifested through us the
[9:40] more of his character the more of his
[9:43] attributes I also remember the scripture
[9:46] says don't despise the day of small
[9:49] beginnings are of small things
[9:51] it's amazing to me at times how God is
[9:55] working mighty works in us and through
[9:58] us and we fail to recognize it because
[10:02] the enemy is lying because of his
[10:05] accusations I just encourage you right
[10:08] now as you continue to fully surrender
[10:12] your life to the Father's will for you
[10:15] as you begin to pray for that union with
[10:19] him to manifest that you become one with
[10:23] him when he moves your moving when he
[10:26] speaks your speaking when when he
[10:29] ministers your ministering as that
[10:32] begins to form in the bridal body in
[10:35] this hour causing us to be able to
[10:37] overcome by the anointing
[10:40] there is an overcomers anointing that's
[10:43] moving on the body of Christ in this
[10:46] hour if we can only recognize it an
[10:49] anointing that brings us over all of our
[10:52] circumstances all of those familiar
[10:55] places that the enemy has trapped us in
[10:58] for so long I want you to know that God
[11:01] is doing great and mighty things in the
[11:04] lives of his people in 2018 and I'm
[11:09] expecting that what God is doing on the
[11:12] inside of his people is soon going to
[11:16] manifest in our fellowships in our
[11:19] assemblies in our prayer groups in ways
[11:22] that we have been praying for and
[11:24] expecting for a long time don't you be
[11:27] discouraged with the circumstances that
[11:30] are surrounding you right now put your
[11:33] hope your trust your confidence in the
[11:36] Lord Jesus Christ and he will surely see
[11:39] you through let's allow him to live his
[11:44] life through us day by day minute by
[11:48] minute for the glory of God
[11:51] god bless you on your journey
[11:53] [Music]
[11:59] you
