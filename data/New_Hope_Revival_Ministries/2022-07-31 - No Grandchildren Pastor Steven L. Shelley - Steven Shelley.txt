good to us tomorrow is sister joyce greeley's birthday she's not with us they are in south carolina uh this morning they went up to the uh they were two nights at the tent revival if you'll remember in april when we were having meetings with brother miller uh sister keisha was here from brother uh simmons's church and she played the organ and sang and she invited us to come to the tent meetings sister anna miller's brother brother cliff farmer was one of the speakers and the greeleys were there two nights and now they've moved on and they're going to take a couple of nights of the missionary camp if any of you could run up and get a service or two you would be blessed in ruth north carolina i don't suppose i'll be able to go this time but that starts i think maybe tuesday night or wednesday night i'm not sure which but you'll be blessed i've been going for years and uh don't always get to be there but now you can stream um those will be wonderful meetings they're raising funds for missionaries i saw our good friend brother stephen bayanima at the meeting there with brother simmons from uganda he has come to be a part of the of the summer meetings and and i was blessed i listened to brother brooks you know i'm a little partial to brother brooks he's been a longtime friend of mine and so is brother simmons when i heard the message of truth those were the first two brothers that came to greet me and i will never forget it i appreciated it then and i appreciate it now and brother brooks preached real good and then sister anna's brother brother cliff farmer he did some really good preaching he was just shrinking his opportunities every other paragraph yes he was not preaching the kind of message that gets you invited so you have to make up your mind what's important obeying god or getting put on the on the posters and uh i appreciated it very very much and then i got to i was studying last night and i got to listen to brother keith reed also a friend of ours from the church in jamaica and he was preaching up a storm you know what the theme was every night jesus and change that was the theme jesus and change isn't that what brother josh was singing about today i want you all to know that song is of a different uh that's of a different level i'm just sitting there thinking the the the music world would like to get a hold of a song like that that song it's of a different level it comes from a different place and i really really appreciated the anointing and i i tell you what sister sharon ran it took everything i could to keep from running it i want to run it made me want to run made me want to jump a pew that's all we need if we've got when we realize that he's all we need and he supplies every need oh it's so wonderful let me go down this list real quick um this tuesday would be brother west's birthday so we will be thinking about sister west we miss him so much was chatting with paul a few minutes last night and and we miss him we just really do and then thursday of this week would have been sister tebow's birthday this is our first birthday her first birthday without us and us without her but she is in the presence of the lord and mary beth has a birthday on friday and they are enjoying the beauty of iceland for a few more days and we want us hopefully she will catch this service at some point and we'll know that we love her and that we are sending her a happy birthday and then on saturday is sister teresa's birthday did you know that you know it's coming up and uh so i just know that sometimes you don't know what day you just know it's coming but you don't know what day of the week it's next saturday so let all the family hear that that didn't know what day it was god is good to us we had some wonderful fellowship this week with sister weems and royale it was so wonderful to be in her home and and feel that if you've you've ever had an opportunity to be there you get to feel that wonderful peace that wonderful presence of the lord we started praying and we went through the whole family and then we went through the whole campground we're just praying for every house house by house that god will do his best for each and every one he's just faithful that way amen how many of you appreciate a service where there's just no hindrance i appreciate that let me show you what i found this week i was praying about something and i want to read you this it won't take but just a moment they don't have it up there they might could pull it up i don't know it's from a message 1960 the 10 virgins and the 144 000 jews 12 11 60 in the morning this is not my message but this was my life for several years and i want to give god thanks this morning i don't want to hurt anybody's feelings but i want to give god thanks this morning that it's not my life anymore and should it ever rise up again we won't wait nearly as long to do something about it paragraph three he's uh talking to us about atmosphere a little bit and he says in paragraph i believe it's paragraph three i may have took a number off he said see if you've got a resenting audience the holy spirit won't even reveal you got to have something that working together he said they were in one place and in one accord and then there came a sound from heaven rushing see but but he said when you got no matter how much i'd pray this brother branham talking no matter how much i'd pray and lay day and night studying and praying before the lord walk down here maybe the anointing on me walk up here and feel that resentment see he just it just grieves him right away [Music] it's awful to get in that shape husbands can sometimes get in a place where they resent their wives wives can sometimes get in a place where they resent their husbands children parents parents children church families resenting one another you can't get rid of your family but i tell you it's not a smart idea to stay in a church where you resent the leader if you resent the pastor and nothing can seem to make it any better eventually you've got to do something for your family if you love them like you say you do you've got to do something on their behalf and you know that ought not to hurt anybody's feelings it's just the way it works the best ideas to get prayed through over that let that resentment go and receive from whoever god's placed you with but if you can't it's not right to let that hinder the whole thing he goes on he said maybe the anointing on me walk up here and feel that resentment it just grieves him right away he won't reveal nothing it shuts the gift down he said but when you walk down here listen when you walk down here in under the anointing and feel your audience under the anointing somebody's been praying somebody's been listening to the word this week somebody prayed before they came today somebody got under hallelujah somebody got under the anointing he said that's when the holy spirit begins to work then and he begins to move and do great things for us so you see i'll tell you that is the goodness of god amen and as soon as we got out from under that resentful spirit god began to do some things and he began to send this one and that one and this one and this one and that when we're working on 13 13 that god has sent to be a part of this church since the first week of april that's the

british columbia these are just the ones who tell us a lot of people are streaming they don't make any comment or anything uh here's someone from lexington georgia i'm not even sure exactly where that is up there somewhere we'll just say like we always say somewhere near atlanta if we don't know where it is is it is it up that way lexington do you all know if we don't know where something is we just so it's up there somewhere near atlanta john 3 there was a man verse 1 there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews and the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him and jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god nicodemus sayeth unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god now that's powerful that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit is what it is spirit marvel not that i said unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but can't not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit may god add his blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated i want you to turn with me now if you will to romans chapter 10 and verse 9 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved you know that ought not to be old news that ought to be what it is good news and fresh news it may have been a lifetime ago that you trusted in those words applied them to your life and made your confession unto the lord but i want you to know there still as brother robert was praying here this morning there are still many people that hadn't made it this far come on now and so brother branham gave us that that abc's you accept it as the truth you believe it in your heart and then you confess it with your mouth the a b c's of salvation accept believe confess and when we do that he said right here that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved there's no if ands or buts no maybe souls about it if you will do that and be sincere in your heart you will be saved those who call upon the name of the lord the bible said and that's with faith attached that's believing that it's going to make a difference in your life you will be saved nicodemus a ruler of in the law he found out that there was only one way not by trusting the law not by trusting the covering of sin that the law provided but he found out there was only one way to see and inherit you see i don't want to just see the kingdom of god many people can see it afar off but i'll never walk into it but i want to be one of those who sees the kingdom and one who inherits the kingdom jesus was talking to nicodemus like that he said you've got to be born again nicodemus couldn't understand it i preached this not too long ago we went through a sermon or two on being born again i'm not going to spend much time there but i wanted to use it as a foundation because it's a very powerful truth to be born from above it's a very powerful truth and we want to thank god for that let me read the end time evangelism before we get good and started here paragraph 57 brother branham is preaching on this born-again thing and he said jesus said ye must be born again he said in order to be born again it's letting yourself go how many of you know who the hindrance is oh the church likes to tell you the devil is the big hindrance but i want you to know sometimes the biggest hindrance between you and a closer walk with god is not the devil at all sometimes it's you in the way it's me that gets in the way so brother branham said it's letting yourself go and dying and it doesn't mean that physical death it means dying to your own will to your own desires to your own ways maybe you pick somebody out and god picks somebody else out maybe you choose a career and god chooses a job come on now maybe you choose a popular church and god said oh no you're going to go down there to the one that when you when you're traveling up through chicago the devil knows you're there i keep preaching about you're going to be a few gr kind of gathered with the despised ones you see what we have to do is let go of ourself and we have to go ahead and die and the spirit of christ come into you you cannot make it with your own spirit you can only make it with his spirit are you with me the spirit of christ coming into you he said then you're no more yours so when you say i am my own man no you're not if you've been born again you don't belong to yourself you're bought with a price the precious blood of jesus christ you're a servant not the self but to the savior he said then you're no more yours it's christ in you isn't that what our brother was singing can a man have christ and not be changed it's impossible can a man have christ in his life in fullness and thirst for the world and hunger for the sinful ways of this life no because when christ comes in and he comes in to stay and you build him a place and you make him welcome in your life he's going to deliver you it may be degree by degree it may be level by level it may be inch by inch but you're going to come forth with deliverance in your life i love i tell you those words i'm thinking back now again to the lyrics of that song i've i've heard that that the question only causes confusion it's according to who you're asking the questions if you're asking us preachers we might confuse you but if you're going to your papa and you're saying why am i thus why am i in this mess and you listen to him you lay your head i'm going to preach in a minute you lay your head on his chest and let him talk to your heart he wants to tell you why you're where you are he not only wants to reveal do you why you're where you are but he wants to reveal to you a way to get out and a way to come up higher because there's more for you are you with me he goes on let me i want to make sure i finish that quote you're no more yours it's christ in you see the holy spirit paul said i die daily yet i live not i but christ liveth in me see christ this this life that i now live is not my life i'm not overcoming with my life i'm overcoming with his life i didn't hear you amen now i want to go to the 70 of the week of daniel just real quick and catch a paragraph don't get bored yet paragraph 28 i want to catch this one here he said and here in the audience and out in the land where the tapes will go there will probably be tens of thousands of born-again christians hear this and we know father that when we are born again he's praying that our spirit is what born from above you know that's what it means in the greek when you look up the greek words for born again it literally means to be born from above because there is a i'm getting too only preachers will understand sometimes you get so excited for what you're going to do what you're going to say [Music] i was getting excited over what i hadn't said yet and my heart was about to take off out of my chest it was beating so fast i'm thinking if i don't let me have a little water here i don't want to i don't hit the floor you know i feel well but i just feel excited for some reason it's all right won't hurt us he said father that when we are born again that our spirit is born from above hmm i could say a lot about where they like to place the soul in the spirit i could say a lot but i won't he's just quoting jesus here jesus placed it right where it belongs he said father that when we are born again that our spirit is born from above remember he tells us that the soul is the nature of the spirit which really means that the soul reflects what has happened in the spirit now when they hear that quote they take it in an entirely different direction altogether and they say that places that places uh soul inside of spirit but that's not what he is saying he's saying that the nature of the spirit is the soul meaning if you want to know what's going on in the spirit you watch what the soul is doing [Music] because the soul is mind will and emotions and if you're operating out of a spirit born from above a spirit that has come directly from christ how many of you know that spirit will have some governance it will have some authority in your mind and your will and your emotions did you know sometimes it's just pausing a minute that would save us from a lot of heartache not reacting emotionally but reacting with wisdom because we took a deep breath it's good to breathe it's good to breathe i could go somewhere with that but i better go on now that our spirit is born from above it is the spirit of god the holy spirit upon us and we realize that the holy spirit is all powerful anybody believe that and can do anything for us that we desire to be done when you have the holy spirit inside of you you have the endless resources of god whatever you need is available to you from the inside he said it we know father oh that's it isn't that the end of that one then heavenly father we would ask you to release our faith to that spirit that it might be able to secure for us this morning and for the glory of the kingdom of god all these requests and desires that we might be healed of our sickness and our afflictions that we might serve our god with all that's in us you see how many people respond did you feel how many people responded to such a simple prayer why don't we read it again then heavenly father we would ask you to release our faith to that spirit that it might be able to secure for us this morning and for the glory of the kingdom of god all these requests and desires that we might be healed of our sicknesses and our afflictions that we might serve our god with all that's in us isn't that humble isn't that humble isn't that just where we ought to be this morning when we approach him all right and then i want to go to one more before we move into something else jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever are you still awake paragraph five so therefore no man could save another i want you to hear me how many of you have ever won someone to the lord led somebody to christ the bible said he that wenteth souls is wise if you've never led somebody else to christ you ought to get up and get busy because one of the evidences of the holy ghost is a travail of souls when somebody else's condition begins to pull on you and your soul begins to travail for their soul you can say that's the work of the holy spirit in your life and it's a joy it's a privilege i don't think we ought to do it like notches on our belt to compare ourselves with one another but i think every one of us ought to have a desire to lead somebody to christ but you cannot save them mama can't save you you're listening daddy can't save you your pastor can't save you the bishop can't save you the missionary can't save you the prophet can't save you pastor can't save you so therefore no man could save another if it would have been so jesus would not had to die if people could be born again or be saved or whatever you want to call it by all of these different ideas they have come up with in the message then jesus would have never had to die but he had to die but when jesus died at calvary he settled he settled the sin question for how long forever he said the price was paid completely it was so met that god identified that it was true he goes on to say now the only thing we have to do to receive this there it is it's to accept it to believe it and accept it but no matter how much that he died for our salvation you need to start listening in here we're getting to the place where i want you to catch this he said we must ourself accept it as our i'm sick and tired of hearing them say you better watch those experiences they love to talk about experiences but don't forget that every quote must be balanced with everything else he said one of these days if i live long enough i'm going to come out on a series i have i've got 30 pages of notes where quotes contradict one another it appears until you come to an understanding that the reason why it was preached that way is to make sure that you and i have the balance between the two not so that we stand and say that one's wrong it's not wrong it's just so that we can have the balance i mentioned one of those to you the other night tuesday night in fact i think where they oh they just had it all over social media where brother bannon said where there will be gifts there will be confusion well i just think that's grand but you cannot take that and say then we don't need the gifts because brother branham says over and over and over and over there's five gifts given to the church apostle prophet pastor teacher and evangelist and then he said there are nine spiritual gifts given in the church that must be there to keep the church clean i've got about 50 pages of quotes where he says that over and over and over again so you can't go off and take one and say see we don't need the gifts because where the gifts are there's just confusion what do you have to do you got to balance it out brother green brother branham turns to brother green whatever you do brother perry keep your balance in the scriptures you want to find where the balance is you lay the quote against the quote and then you take it right back to the word and see what the word has said then you find the balance between the two and you can say amen to both of them when i read that that where the gifts are there there can be confusion i say amen because it certainly can be that way but when i read him where he said all nine gifts should be in operation i say amen i'm glad you're helping me because i'm fixing to come to one of those in just a minute here stay with me he said now the only thing we have to do to receive this is to accept it and believe it and accept it but no matter how much that he died for our salvation we must ourself accept it as our own personal experience i'm asking you this morning have you had your own personal experience with jesus christ our own desire he goes on to say let's read we must want to be saved and believe that upon the basis of his shed blood that we are saved after we have met the requirements of the bible paragraph seven he said i believe in the bible being the full revelation of jesus christ now i do believe that god can do things that's not written in the bible because he's god oh that'll get religious feathers ruffling oh somebody said well god couldn't do that it's not in the bible your bible is not god your bible is the written record of god's word but your bible isn't god somebody said wait a minute now the word became flesh and dwelt among us that's right in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word became flesh that's right a flesh word a living word you could say jesus is the word you can say that your bible contains the word but god is not limited to the written record he's a god who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above that which we could even ask her to come on sometimes it's just a little bit of semantics someone heard us praying that god would return to us something that was lost and we were calling it back and someone said that's not even in the bible how dare you to pray a prayer like that i said listen if god can make an axe head swim god can put a credit card back in my pocket sometime you just need to relax a little bit know that god is a big god he said but as long as we can find it in the bible as a promise we know it's true because the word is true always so we believe him to keep to keep us from us are you folks ready to go home yet are you sure because i'm going to start my message now genesis 17 would you turn there with me genesis 17. and when abram was 90 years old in nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the mighty i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect i'm going to read it again and when abram was 90 years old and 9 that's 99 if you don't want to do the math the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am el shaddai that's it that's the first time it mentions i am oh mighty god i am el shaddai doesn't matter whether you say el shaddai or el shaddai in the old pentecost church they like to add syllables to every biblical word so they'd always say el shaddai it did have a good ring but it's el shaddai the almighty god i am el shaddai walk before me and be thou perfect does that excite anybody does anybody believe he still else should i you don't think he quit being el shaddai when he became jesus do you don't you know that he's still el shaddai he's still out should i walk before me and be thou perfect i better hurry and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be abraham we say abraham in hebrew it's avraham it's the addition of the breath it's the addition of the ruach hakodesh in hebrew the holy spirit when when god appeared to abram he said i am el shaddai he was breathing his life on abram changing his name from avram to avraham so that his name would forever bear in it the breath of the name of god avram was having a personal experience with a living god it changed his life forever you'll never be called abram but thy name shall be called abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee period my grandmother sitting in birmingham alabama in 64 wasn't it the prophet of god is preaching and praying for the sick he turns his back to the audience and he takes a roll not too far from where she was sitting with his back to the audience he goes down that roll calling every person by name by gender telling each and every one of them what their need was telling some of them what the doctor said about them telling some of them what was in their purse then he began to speak a little bit about abram's name being abraham and god changing the name my grandmother was sitting there thinking my that is some interesting i've never seen anything quite like that in my life and all of a sudden this thought came to her mind and she spelled b-r-a-n-h-a-m seven letters it scared her so bad god was trying to give her a revelation of something that would have changed her life it took us many more years to get the revelation of what god was showing her the very sign of the messiah amen because the son of man jesus christ was present in the building not because brother branham was in the building but because the the son of man was revealing himself through a son of man and oh what a difference it makes when you understand listen when god breathes on you [Music] it changes everything you see i made that little quote before i was when i was first getting up here to make people nervous and people start start scattering but i want to tell you something you'd better take your stand this is an hour to take your stand you want to make sure that you have had a personal experience with god for yourself because he don't have any grandchildren no no let's read a little bit more just a little bit more and i will make the exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and i will give unto thee unto thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god god said unto abraham thou shall keep my covenant therefore you excuse me therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations this is my covenant which you shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man shall every man child among you shall be circumcised and you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you i won't read all the way to verse 14 as i had prepared to do you can read that for yourself now i said a moment ago that i want us to have the balance all right so in a message debate on tongues 1960 paragraph two i want you to listen to this this is one they love i love them all but this is one they like to highlight now if i was a boy and i was under the tutor ship of my father and mother and you wanted to adopt me and i give you my knife now you've got my gift but not me see now tongues is a gift of the holy ghost there's no scripture in the bible that says it is the holy ghost amen it's a gift of the holy ghost now watch on acts 2 38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost i want you to listen to this read on because they were marveling because they heard every man speaking in his own language wherein he was born see and he said if you would repent you would receive that gift of the holy ghost now this is what i want you to get listen to he said now the gift of william branham is not william branham [Music] see he said now if you'll notice you say well the gift of god is the holy ghost the holy ghost is god so see how how you could couldn't use it there well to everything that i speak of it must land no real servant of god is going to be put off by you checking him with the word i won't receive it now i only receive when he tells me then he always clears it with the scripture if he didn't i would not believe it i want you to know that's the right way let god speak to your heart then you clear that with the word the word is the absolute that was the thing brother henry simmons told me so many years ago you've heard me mention it many times through the year he said brother shelly the same god that was talking to you in pentecost we'll talk to you now the same god that led you in the word then will lead you in the word now he said don't you go to the message to find your sermon this is what he told me he said don't you go to the quotes to find your message he said you do it like you've always done it you go to the word let god speak to you from the word and then he said then you go find the quotes to help magnify accentuate help help people to understand what the word said he said if you ever start doing it the other way you'll lose your calling and forfeit your gift that's god's order brother branham said that's the way he did it he told me all along the road he said if he did i would not believe it although as much as he's told me along the road still if he ever told me anything that wasn't scriptural it would not be right because the scripture is absolutely our basis this is what they love they love this so much [Music] that they won't read the rest they don't read those first two paragraphs they like this one so much they skip through all of that and they get to this one we cannot base our salvation upon sensations or experiences of others are on our own experience it's got to be the word of god see because that's the true mark and they'll preach two and a half to three hours on that see you'll hear them say see it's not by experience you just take the word believe the word that's it that's like saying where the gifts are there'll be confusion you've got to take it all and over and over and over and over i hear him say you must have your own experience with god so please take this in balance and understand that at the end of the road you cannot defeat the devil with a vision you cannot defeat the devil with a dream with a prophecy with a message in tongues but you can defeat the devil every day every minute of the day with the word [Music] so our salvation is not based on a feeling it's based on the word it's not based on an experience it's based on the word but without a personal experience you have never encountered the living god you are not born from above you are not born from above unless you've met him like abram met him now don't be offended when i do this don't be offended i'm not trying to be vulgar don't be offended this is how abraham met him you understand how many of you understand because one of the meanings of el shaddai is the many breasted one understand brother branham tells us he said it's double-breasted that's all right because he typed that he said old testament and new testament he said you've got to suck life from both just telling you don't be offended you've got to suck a lot but but the word didn't say two breasts it's or double breath the word is mini breast he is the mini breasted one do you understand that's how abraham met him now that's more than an experience that's god's saying i am carrying all you need lay your head son on my bosom and you will never be needy again [Music] come on now you all heard one of my friends come preach years ago paul keith came and he spoke about his encounter with a with a hebrew scholar a language scholar who said to him that that is only one phase of the meaning of el shaddai almighty god many breasted one he said there are many others you can research it and find many many many many explanations but i want to give you the one that that he emphasized and i think it's all powerful and i want to make sure that you understand that this is really what he is saying when when god said to abraham i am el shaddai and i'm here to change your life and change your name and give you a destiny that you don't know anything about he said that in saying or identifying himself as el shaddai he was saying are you with me i want you to be because in a moment you're going to want to be he said i am the god that can do for you what you cannot do for yourself that's who he is brother josh that's who he is i am the god who can do for you what you cannot do for yourself i'm the god who can provide for you what you cannot provide for yourself you can't nurse your own breasts but he said i've got everything you have need of come lay your head abram somebody give god a little praise here [Applause] so even though we cannot base our salvation on experiences it must be based on the word we know we've got to have our own experience if you know that say amen this day the scripture's fulfilled paragraph 91 is everybody still here i know it's a little slow going that's all right i i got another hour i hadn't broke into my first finish my first one yet so now man has a right to call himself thus until he's talked face to face with god on the backside of a desert somewhere where he met god himself he said and all the atheists in the world could not explain it away from him he was there he knowed it happened are you there now read that for me every christian should have that experience before they say anything about being a christian you can't base your salvation on an experience you base it on the word but you can't even call yourself a christian without an experience somebody said that's the balance that's where it balances we base everything on the word but you've got to accept that you've got to fellowship that word for yourself i think we get things a little cool up here on the platform i'm sweaty but i think it's taking my voice so will you adjust that just a tad and i see some a little bundle and some fanning and some bundled now i want to read why the message why is that a good one it is paragraph 154 please stay with me as david du plessis once said anybody know who david duplessis was his name was mr pentecost he was he became a great leader in the ecumenical movement he was called mr pentecost because wherever he went he represented pentecost and he will believe that everybody needed a pentecostal experience whether they were baptist or methodist or episcopalian or catholic or whoever they were so this was his idea brother branham knew him well been in meetings with him and he quoted him often and this is the one i want to emphasize to you in just a moment as david depressus once said give me just a little more in the monitor as david de plessis once said god don't have no grandchildren you're not born by your mother's experience listen to me young people especially you're not born into this thing by your mother's experience amen brother you're not born into this by your daddy's experience or your pastor's experience god don't have any grandchildren he said that's right he said that's where our pentecostal brethren are becoming their children come into church and just say well we're pentecostal because papa was you know where i'm going if papa was a pentecostal and got the baptism of the holy ghost you'll have to get it the same way papa did does anybody believe that you believe that wave your hand at me if papa was a pentecostal and got to baptism the holy ghost you'll have to get it the same way papa did he don't have grandchildren he just has sons and daughters not grandsons and granddaughters just sons and daughters it's true all right let's go on so you've got to do the same thing they did on the day of pentecost anybody believe that you've got to have the same experience now let's go back your salvation is not based on anybody else's experience or your own he said it's based on the word but here he is telling us you've got to have the same experience so don't come around and tell me you don't need an experience with god don't tell me you can't trust an experience if you have one that's based on the word you can and this is the kind that's based on the word he said you got to have the same thing they had that they had god let's read that together that sentence there god don't never change his program you know how they got it they got it they got it like a bunch of drunks very very few of our churches would ever be accused of too much carrying on [Music] very unlikely the neighbors would peer through the windows during worship time and say that's a bunch of drunk holy rollers because we have found a more reformed way don't tell me it's based on the word the book of psalms says it's not the book of psalms tells me how i must worship god amen shout unto god with a loud voice he said amen clap your hands he said to the lord yes sing praise him in the dance he said it praise him in the dance praise him on the high sounding symbols let everything that had breadth praise the lord we want to be reverent i love it when they say something like this we don't want to disturb the holy spirit and you know what if you could hear him talk you know what the holy spirit would say i so long to disturb you we don't want to disturb the holy ghost let me tell you something the holy ghost would love to disturb you he would love to disturb me he would love to throw me off of my routine and cause me to be filled with the breath and the life of almighty god are you here you've got to do the same thing they did on the day of pentecost you've got to have the same experience notice when this was too just just for you date watchers june june of 63 seals are preached bible's a new book right right and here's still what he's telling us he said he never changes his ways god don't never change his program he just does the same thing all the time the way he lays down his program it must toe to that each time it's got to be the same thing and if you will do the same thing the same results will come amen that's right does anybody believe that can i give you some more i know you didn't just come for reading queen of sheba but you need it because i got something to share in a minute verse seven paragraph seven the reading of the scriptures tonight we've just read a portion of the infallible word of the eternal god and jesus had just been upbraiding them because their hardness of their heart because they had not believed him then we find that he back in the former part of the scriptures that it in the same text or chapter they had called him beelzebub because he was doing the supernatural signs and if anyone knew that god listen if anyone knew that god always dwells in supernatural you know where god dwells he always dwells in supernatural if it's natural he may not be dwelling there but if it's supernatural he said in his children which are his offspring not grandchildren we're talking about word born children now aren't we he said because god himself is supernatural and his children which are his offspring is the nature of their father see the language nature of their father meaning that jesus nature of their father you same way nature the soul being the nature of the spirit do you see the language he said they also believe in the supernatural so if they cannot believe in the supernatural then the spirit of god is not in them dominating their life is there anybody in here that wants to be dominated by the spirit of god oh i want to be dominated by the spirit of god is there more to that one he said these great cultured men those days the priests and the rabbis and the pharisees which were very highly cultured men fine educated scholars know the word just the letter and they had to live unspotted lives because he that despised moses law died under two or three witnesses and they would be stoned if they did anything wrong so they must be a select group a scholarly group an educated group [Music] but god doesn't dwell in any of that where does he dwell he lives in the supernatural he dwells in humility in an honest heart anybody such as we'll receive him these men didn't have that they were puffed up in themselves oh are you there i i got to get somewhere i'm not there yet i've got three or four things here uh maybe i'll bring them uh give me just a minute i need to know where i'm going oh my i'd like to go there too mm-hmm let me share a little history with you do you mind this is the article this is the article where brother branham got that got this the quote he'd been in many meetings with brother david duplessis and he had heard him give this testimony but this is the article this appeared in the july august issue of voice magazine did anybody ever read voice magazine sister alfredo a few of you did it was the international publication of the full gospel businessmen's fellowship and brother branham's experiences and testimonies would often appear in voice magazine including the tent vision was in voice magazine and i have some i couldn't put my hands on them to show you but but they're there somewhere and uh this is a copy pdf you can get this online this is a pdf copy of the article that brother david duplessis wrote and i want to read some of it well you just been reading all my i know i know but i want to do this anyway if you'll stay awake that's why i come down here see if i can help you a little bit i'm not going to read at all i'd love to i'd love to read it all but i'm not going to read it all cause you'd sleep and you'd miss it some of you but i wanna read some excerpts is that all right good look what it says out there in big bold letters god has no grandsons by david du plessis and it says there in the in the top no matter whether you are jew catholic protestant or pentecostal you must be born again or you are not in the family because god has no grandsons you better hear me message people it was early morning around four o'clock in the month of january there was snow everywhere outside the radio news had predicted 10 degrees below zero temperatures that night i was awakened from a deep restful sleep give me just a little more in the house i was uh awakened from a deep restful sleep by a voice that seemed loud and clear i sat up in my bed and looked around the room the street light was shining through one window i saw no one in the room all was quiet yet that voice kept ringing in my ear it seemed i could still hear it distinctly saying god has no grand sons i stamped the light on and took my bible is there a text about grandsons i could i could remember none how about sons i turned on the gospel of john chapter 1 verse 12 and 13. i have all those verses up there if you want to put any of them up for the people to see you can but as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name so here's a scripture about sons which were born not of the blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god sons of god born sons of god he said i checked further scriptures romans 8 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the no grandsons they're sons of god he goes on first john 3 12 3 1-2 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed on us that we should be called the sons of god he goes on beloved now are we the sons of god galatians 4 4 and 7 god sent forth his son to redeem and he goes on he said but i could find nothing about grandsons then i began to check whether there was any text that might signify that god could be a grandfather but i could find nothing in the old or the new testament so i concluded god is nobody's grandfather it was about five in the morning now i switched off the light and put on my thinking cap what have i discovered nothing new i always knew god our father in heaven he's the father of all believers believers in christ are called sons of god i have only found a new way of saying an old truth god is nobody's grandfather only father at breakfast that morning i discussed this experience with the pastor and his wife the voice and the thoughts seem to stay with me all the time this lasted for all the ten days that i continued to minister in minneapolis minnesota i received no revelation or inspiration those whom i talked to thought it was very popular way of saying that only those that are born of god are sons of god beyond that there is no relationship god has no grandsons he is no grandfather i had to fly to chicago and by phone made reservations for an evening flight i never checked just how that flight would go after we were airborne i discovered we had to change planes in milwaukee i was so little i was no little displeased because it was another bitter cold night with below zero temperatures then the still small voice whispered maybe you should meet someone on this trip to speak to that settled it i shall be watching and seeking to find that someone i looked over the passengers in the plane no guidance then after landing i looked over the people in the terminal of milwaukee no one spoke to me i saw none i felt led to go speak to then came the call for the flight to chicago when i came to the gate i felt terribly lonely and very homesick then i heard voices i saw five men in black come toward me they began to shake hands with each other and only one came on toward the gate the others weighed farewell so it seems we were the two passengers for the flight this may be the person that i have to talk to there is no one else so why not get acquainted are you a passenger due to chicago i ask yes sir are we the only two passengers said my friend there is the last call it seems we must be the only two passengers are you a roman catholic priest sir i question yes i am a priest with an educational appointment came his reply as we walked on the plane then he asked and you what are you oh i am also a priest i said but what kind of priest are you queried my companion he said sir i'm a pentecostal priest you mean you belong to the movement that is growing so fast around the world yes sir that is what is generally admitted these days could you tell me all about them do you know much about the pentecostal movement i told them that i had been in the movement since 1918 and that i had served as secretary for several world conferences of the pentecostal movement oh how fortunate i am to meet you he exclaimed as we boarded the plane i want to know all about you pentecostals as we took two seats side by side the steward has offered her services my friend said to her lady we need nothing we only want to talk so you may go to the front seat and crawl up there and go to sleep for all we care when he said this the holy spirit spoke to me and said to tell him god has no grandsons then i knew that now i would receive further revelation on the word that i had heard the morning i began to witness about my conversion when i was born again or born of god i continue to relate how after my conversion in 1916 i received the holy spirit in 1918 and how i had been called into the ministry i kept quoting new testament parallels first saying christ was born of the spirit which we call the virgin birth then at the age of 30 at jordan he received the holy spirit two distinct happenings first birth then endurement for service christ never ministered until he had received the holy spirit so christ commanded his disciples not to leave the city of jerusalem until they had repented receive the holy ghost on the day of and he goes on he's just preaching away to him again two experiences suddenly my friend interrupted with oh i see what you are trying to do you are trying to revive the apostolic church of the new testament in this century and you expect the same things to happen now that were experienced by the early churches he said no sir i replied we are trying nothing of the kind we are only standing back and watching it happen all over the world let's think about such a thing as that whoo he said he said the first church was a creation of the holy spirit and he has not changed but in every generation he wants to repeat what he had done in the first christian church through the first leaders and members i know it's not brother branham but brother branham quoted this man he said then i proceeded to tell him how in miracle fashion in many countries almost simultaneously at the turn of the century the holy spirit moved upon those who were praying for revival it happened in the united states in europe in asia in africa on every continent in almost every country of the world the pentecostal revival became known as the pentecostal movement which now has somewhere around 10 million adherents he said i have no time and space to give all the details finally he interrupted and said i take it that you think all other christian churches are wrong or that they've gone wrong i prayed for guidance to answer that question in a flash i got it i said yes sir they've all gone wrong and even now the pentecostals are falling into the same ditch this is mr pentecost known all over the world mr pentecost and he's indicting his own group so don't you get your little self worked up in a few minutes when you hear me indicting my own group because here we are another generation and we're doing the same thing falling in the ditch [Music] he goes on yes sir they even now the pentecost is falling in the same ditch and they are going wrong too he looks shocked but what do they do when why where how do they all go wrong now sir i said your church claims to be the oldest church not so yes there's where your righty answered then your church went wrong first talk about the catholic church then your church went wrong first isn't that good he said and after that all fell into the same ditch i added they all do the same thing they begin right and keep right for a long time and then they go off the highway of god into the byways of men you let the old-timers die come on now you let the old gifted let me tell you something this message is facing a crisis you don't have to say a mineral me we that have come out of pentecost to believe this truth are dying we're physically dying i can now call myself an elder i've been around long enough we're dying those men who believe this message but still believe in the gifts many of them are dying and if god doesn't raise up another generation and that's what he's trying to do but it's not just a youth meeting that's going to do it it's not just a youth camp that's going to do it it's total deliverance that's going to be required you can't bring young people to a weekend let them jump and dance and holler and talk in tongues and have a good time roll around and send them back to their dead churches where that's never going to be cultivated or encouraged in them again have them go to the same pornography sites that we're going to to start with and expect there to be leadership for this next generation of believers it's going to require something more than that we're going to have to get every person to their own personal birth every individual [Applause] you don't have any grandchildren he doesn't have any grandchildren this is not to condemn anybody here it's not to condemn anybody out there it's just to say sometimes we go back we look at history and we say god have mercy let us not be so stupid to do the same thing again you know the churches are so afraid of a little bit of wildfire they're afraid somebody's going to talk in tongues and nobody's going to interpret it so they shut it all down they're afraid somebody's going to fall while they're dancing so they shut it all down do what i've done snatch them up and tell them to keep on dancing you you can't live in fear of wildfire my old granny used to say they've cried wildfire wildfire until they put out the fire she said we can't find fire and she said i'll tell you what's in my soul if this is not the fire it'll do till the real fire gets here because it changed my life you can't live in paranoia of wildfire i'm i'm preparing for a dozen different messages at one time i spent several hours yesterday in the gifts and i am so shocked at how many times brother branham tells this same story about meeting a leader who said to him if you all are so pentecostal or whatever so spiritual and your prophet no why don't you teach them women how to operate in the gifts you hear that story he told it over and over and over and over again and and he said because that's not what we're trying to do we're not trying to teach anybody how to operate in the gifts and i hear them say that quote i hear the preachers quote it i hear well-meaning sweet people we're not trying to encourage people that's not what he said he said we're not trying to teach them how [Music] but through the years the quotes changed a little bit i read them i found them dozens he said why don't you teach them how he said that's not what we're trying to do we're not trying to teach them how to operate in the gifts of the spirit that's a whole lot different than saying we're not encouraging them brother branham actually said this is a safe place for those things to take place anybody with me all right i gotta i gotta get back to this oh i got a little emotional there all right he goes on let me let me find my place and i'm skipping a whole lot too but but he said uh they all do the same thing they begin right and keep right for a long time and then fall off into the byways god has no grandsons my friend was he said i what did they do he said i've got to know that before we get off at chicago i've got to i've got to i've got to know that and he said with a deep prayer in my heart i said to him in a slow clear word they give god grandsons and god has no grandsons he was asking what do these churches do to get off how do they get in the ditch and here was his answer he said actually i never heard of such a thing until a few weeks ago he's explaining this to the priest when i heard an audible voice say to me god has no grandsons and only now the this very moment have i learned what the words mean now i'll try to explain why where when and how all this happens now i don't want to go through every one of these scriptures because he is he is really quoting scripture but he said thus it was clear that every jew and every gentile that came into the christian church did so by repentance or conversion or being born of the spirit everyone had a very definite encounter with the living christ the resurrected son of god he said this revival continued and the church grew and christianity swept the world at that time then some jews or some gentile began to reason i was a jew or a gentile and became a christian by repentance for sin and conversion from judaism or paganism and so was my wife but this boy of mine has never been a jew or has never been a gentile he did not grow up in the temple he was born from christian parents in a christian home and was brought up in the christian church he is born christian do you see how this reasoning i think david duplessis was onto something when we go to israel they introduce us to arab christians they call them arab christians to make sure that you understand that they are not muslim arabs when you start investigating you find out that most of them do not even know that it is possible to have a born-again experience with jesus christ i i witness to a man in bethlehem of all places for over an hour and a half telling him that he must be born again he said to me pastor why i was born a christian my mother was a christian my father was a christian i've never prayed to allah why would i need an experience with god to be a christian i was born a christian so i understand this kind of reasoning we have the same thing around this message today i was born a believer i was born a message believer my mama believed this message my daddy believed this message and i believe this message as though that's enough it's not enough every man has to have but let's go back to this let's go back to this because this is worth getting to now he said this may all be true but he has never been born of the spirit that child is not repented as a sinner because he had a strict training as the son of a christian parent he was taught to try and live like a christian for he is the son of god's children the nicest thing you could say about him is that being the son of two of god's children who became a son and a daughter of god by regeneration he is now a grandson of god but he said there it is god has no grandsons you cannot call that boy a christian because his parents were christians what is he nothing not catholic not protestant not christian not pentecostal not message believer he's nothing right until he has his own pentecostal experience by definition the only thing duplicitous said the only thing we could say nice about him is that he was a grandson but god has no grandsons are you awake now i want you to listen to this gradually the early christians began to accept as members into their churches they're well-trained but unregenerated children until the pews were packed with members that had had no encounter with christ as savior and much less a pentecostal experience full churches no births they were not born of the spirit and therefore could not be filled with the spirit god says it is not by power not by might but by my spirit the spirit found no more blood cleansed hearts in the church to dwell in and the church cooled off spiritually until even in the pulpit there stood unregenerate but well-trained preachers that spoke the letter but had not the spirit men who chose preaching and pastoring as a vocation as a as a job as a career like someone would choose to be a lawyer how many of you know the pulpit it's not for a man that chooses to be there because he needs a job brother branham said it's not a meal ticket it's a calling he said when emperor constantine cost his army forced his army to be baptized into the church it was already so dead with a whole generation of unregenerated grandsons that these sinful soldiers felt at home in christian society spiritually the church was dead this is his story history historical spiritually the church was dead but god did not leave it at that time and again the holy spirit found a heart through whom he could reach the ears of the people such men were the exception and were looked upon as fanatics and were often persecuted or martyred we're talking about church history here comes a man saying you've got to have a birth you've got to have an experience you've got to know god for yourself and he was either persecuted or martyred he said there came for instance martin luther out of his ministry came the reformation there seemed to come into life a new church with members that had a fresh and very real encounter with christ and with the real holy spirit however it was not long before some lutheran parents began to reason and say but our children have never been roman catholics they were born lutherans right there it began again grandsons for god in the lutheran and reformation churches it's a repeat isn't it then came john wesley in england and we had the wesleyan revival again men and women were challenged to seek god and be born of the spirit but after two or three generations some parents began to reason our children have never been anglicans or lutherans or roman catholics they're born wesleyans or methodists they were born wesleyans are methodists soon the grandsons filled the church again and revival was over if you don't think this matters he said now at the turn of the century came this pentecostal revival all were called to repentance everyone born of the spirit was now encouraged to seek and receive the baptism in the spirit with the new testament evidence of speaking in tongues and with the manifestation to the holy spirit such as prophecy and healing no matter how the older churches objected the revival spread it was the same in the catholic countries as in protestant countries and even in pagan islands when people are born of the spirit they live when such people are filled with a spirit they receive power to become witnesses he said but what has happened now we find that in the beginning of this revival pentecost 50 years ago everyone was expected to be filled with the spirit with the confirmation of tongues before they could hold any office in the pentecostal church or the pentecostal assembly but there are today the sons and grandsons of pentecostal pioneers who are teaching in sunday schools and holding all kinds of offices in the local churches without ever having a real baptism of the spirit according to acts 2 4. now some of you couldn't get past the speaking in tongues part you know you can't hear no more because he said the evidence of speaking in tongues don't let that throw you they're the ones that shoved it down everybody's throat a generation ago pentecost said if you speak in tongues you've got it all and now pentecostal churches are being led by people who have never had an experience with the holy ghost so even they've given up their dogmas it doesn't matter as long as you've got another generation to keep the church going there's got to be more than that he said the waves of pentecost a power and revival are receding fast what year was this 60 60 1960. we find that in the beginning of this there's danger that in another generation we may have a pentecostal movement without pentecost we do that's what we have today in the world it's a church world today it's a seeker sensitive a seeker friendly group of people that they're more interested in entertaining people with smoke machines and coffee shops and and call themselves pentecostal they're named after their mother the name on the sign out there named after their mother that's a problem they're illegitimate born children blasphemous names they're supposed to be bearing the name of their father you can't bear the name of your father unless you've had a birth if you're carrying the name of your mother you're carrying the name of their own church you're not born of a woman you're not born of a church you're born of a christ you're born of a father see he said we're going to have a pentecostal movement without pentecost that is without the experience but still holding the letter holding the doctrine just like other revivals but emphasize some other truth but never experience it revivals crystallize into societies and establish churches when the grandsons take over but god has no grandsons shocking shocking was all my friend the priest could say then he said we should meet again your grandfather's story has upset my philosophy we parted with a warm handshake i prayed for him i wonder what he pondered that evening what am i a son or a grandson then the next morning when he prayed did he remember our father who art in heaven have i treated him like a grandfather but god is no one's grandfather and he goes on to say i have repeated that story wherever i get an opportunity to preach whether it's roman catholic church or protestant churches or ranks of my own pentecostal brethren remember god has no grandsons how many of you see how many of you see the point god has no grandsons i want to tell you that's why when i saw joshua responding to the holy spirit i wanted to rush over and encourage that because god has no grandsons just a little more it's not it's not quite too yuma arizona the rapture paragraph 99 jesus wants fruit for himself his wife must produce the kind of children that he is so if it does not produce children bride children children of the word then it is denominational child do you understand that if we are producing denominational children we're trying to give god grandsons and he's not looking for grandsons he's looking for sons he said so her first love is for the world and the denomination and she will have returned to that and it cannot produce a true genuine born again christian because there is nothing there to produce it in a conference with god 1960. brother branham said a lot of people that's half born part of the way born grandsons as david duplessis said the other night god don't have grandchildren he only has sons and daughters but when it comes to a place that a grandchild that's just brought in by because his mother was pentecostal or his daddy was pentecostal he become part of the church no sir he's got to be born just like his daddy was cause god doesn't have grandchildren he's got to have the experience he can't go in on papa's experience or mama's experience you've got to have your own experience that was their birth you know you have to have a birth too god don't recognize grandchildren he doesn't have any i forgot i'm yelling and i told him to turn it up out there they're all sons and daughters who say well i was born my mother and father was methodist and i was took into the methodist church that's all right but you're a grandchild until you're born of the spirit of god if my children were here i'll tell you what i want them to listen to this i might give them a shake on the elbow i'd want them to hear this right here he said that's all right but you're a grandchild until you're born of the spirit of god then you're not a grandchild now god remembered his promise and he sent moses and it goes on i'm not going to read the rest of that now because there's so much more here that we could get to but i don't want to do that i want to talk to you personally for just a moment or two and i want to explain to you where i'm coming from the changes that i have seen already around the message churches since i heard the message in the late 80s is absolutely astonishing you used to have special meetings and the pastors would support one another and now there is such a jealousy among some of us i'm going to say some of us there's so such a jealousy among some of us that we're so afraid that if our people go over to another meeting and support they're never coming back and we let jealousy eat us alive this kind of attitude in the ministry it brings in grandchildren but no sons are born because we need exposure to all the five-fold ministry i'm never afraid this is going to sound arrogant but i don't mean it that way at all i'm never afraid i'm never afraid because i know that people can't live on the message of an evangelist i've sat over there and had evangelists through here and see the church turn upside down shouting amen praise god never heard that i get text on my phone brother shelly i've never heard that never heard such preaching never heard those kind of things before and i just laugh inside and i say you've been hearing the very same things same text same quotes for 20 years [Music] but sitting there making sure that i don't let jealousy take a hold of my heart because that is the work of an evangelist to come in and stir up people's hearts [Applause] but there are very few evangelists that could pastor that's why you've got to know what your calling is there are very few evangelists and if he is if he does become a pastor he has to adjust his message a little bit because evangelism sunday after sunday after sunday after sunday doesn't bring the body any higher it's presenting the gospel to lost souls but it's not bringing the bride up into any kind of maturity so we need one another we need a five-fold ministry we need those who have organization callings and anointings we need those who have prophetic calling and anointings we need pastors who can pull people together evangelists that can preach soul-stirring messages we need teachers who can bring the word break it down and teach it to us in a way that we can receive it it is not a competition it's not supposed to be preachers against preachers we're supposed to be doing this thing together i have watched when i was hearing this truth the people the preachers were emphasizing over and over again we've got to get people to the holy ghost listen in the 80s and early 90s the pastors were crying out you've got to have the holy ghost you've got to have the holy ghost you've got to have the holy ghost you've got to have the holy ghost you've got to be plugged into a local church i remember the first youth camp i ever preached around this message i asked a young man who his pastor was and he said william branham i said well that sounds nice but you're going to have a hard time getting him to visit you in the hospital he's been dead since 1965. come on i don't know who's going to dedicate your baby or they found a way around it now they play a tape they do they bring their babies and play brother ram doing the tape so that they can call him their pastor i want you to know that's not what he preached he said we need these offices we need these five offices he taught us we need those gifts of the spirit it seems to me like people are afraid to have the gifts operating because they're afraid it's going to turn into wildfire or they're afraid they're going to have to hurt somebody's feelings when they call them to attention and say wait a minute that's not the way we demonstrate that that's not the way we operate that but isn't that the job of the leadership isn't that what we preachers are supposed to do isn't that part of what a pastor is is to shepherd this thing through growing pains turn this down just a little bit i'm wis i'm talking softer turn this down a little bit please there brother i'm talking softer no one's up there and somebody go up there luke is levi's doing something else i'm talking soft because i i i don't scream but i want to scream so just turn it down just a tad praise the lord better we've got to have our own experience with god now let me tell you some of the fruit of what i'm seeing as i look across social media and i look around and i see what's going on even in our ranks i see these competitions among the girls to see who can get the biggest engagement ring i see these pictures everybody's picture listen in my day if you had one you would never ever ever have flaunted it first of all holiness people didn't wear them and when i came around this message message people didn't wear them just being honest with you and now it's become such a thing that you can feel the com the competition and the competitive spirit because it's what you see pictured on on on social media they want to show that off something's wrong something's wrong now they want to show off their french tips their french manicures you see it it's all out there so everybody can see these things something is wrong the splits are getting higher the straight dresses are getting straighter the hair is getting wilder something's wrong and i'm telling you you don't have to help me you're not saying man i'm telling you i know what's wrong we're raising a generation of grandchildren that many of them never had their own pentecostal experience with god never ever had a real new birth and because of that the glitter and glamour of the world is still capturing them when i came around the message of the hour in the beginning we preached what brother branham preached he said that a man and a woman are not to kiss each other until they're married amen guess where he got such a crazy idea the bible paul said it's better for a man not to touch a woman amen it's simply because the pull of the flesh is real it's it's it's it's normal and it's real and so we should respect that brother branham called it sex glands in the lips i'm not sure that that is scientifically what you would call but i'm just saying amen because anybody that's ever kissed someone passionately [Music] knows what it does it sends a release of chemicals from your top of your head to your toes if she's purty and if she's not and not yours you ought not to be trying it out come on and so when they got married in the church they were supposed to be standing there pure before the lord having never touched one another is that right having never kissed one another so we preachers in those days we kind of agreed that it was a little bit classless it was a little bit crass to ask them to to share their first kiss in front of a congregation of people all gawking at them pastors we talked about it in meetings pastors meetings and we said why don't we just let them go out after they have been married and share their kiss and whatever else when they're married so that it doesn't become some kind of screaming out in church and making some catcalls and i've heard i've seen it all you don't have to say amen i'm not even asking for an amen now i'm just telling you how far we've come we've come a long long way and now it becomes a competition and now here's what's said when they see when the when the young people a lot of the young people around this message when they see a wedding like benjamin and genus where they didn't share a kiss the first thing they want to know is where was the kiss and you know what my answer was in private where it should have been because if they would have kissed awkwardly i'm just using them awkwardly somebody would have said some boy some boy some grandson some grandson in the church who's never had a born-again experience would have sat there and said i can tell that's his first kiss there used to have been a time that we would have celebrated that just a minute amen brother but instead we've raised a generation that mocks it and if they'd have kiss too good like some i've seen recently then people would have said they've had lots of practice there's something wrong when everything we do draws criticism from our own i know the pentecostals won't understand this i know the evangelicals won't understand us but something is wrong when we're drawing criticism from one another because we choose to do it like it was presented to us in the word and in the message now it's a competition who can have the biggest reception who can have the biggest this who can have the biggest that who can have the biggest ring who can make it the biggest this and on and on and on what you say what's that got to do with what you're preaching i realize that it's all the side effects of a generation of young people who many of them not all of them but many of them have never understood you've got to have your own encounter with the living god don't matter if you were born around the message god doesn't have any grandchildren the truth doesn't produce grandchildren it produces sons amen i want every young person in this assembly and those fellowshipping with this assembly i want you to know this is not to condemn you or anyone else it is to encourage you you've got to know you must know you can't ride your preacher's coattail you can't ride the old timer's coattail you've got to know a generation ago the young people didn't hold hands until they were married now it starts way before the engagement pictures and it goes all the way in i'm telling you something to me to me it's a it's a byproduct it is a side effect of what we have allowed to happen we have dumbed it down we have dumbed it down to make provision for people who are not willing to pay a price to have a birth somebody said well we don't we need more altar calls when you're called up here to worship god and you know you haven't had a birth nobody has to tell you nobody should have to tell you now if you know you don't have a birth you just walk over a little bit farther than the rest and kneel right down there nobody ought to have to tell you that's why it's here only you know somebody said i don't want anybody else to know it's better that everybody in the building know that you're not sure whether or not you have had a bear than to live another day not knowing whether or not you have been born again oh oh it goes on i know i use just some kind of frivolous uh side effects there there are so many there are so many when when uh when my boy started uh having interest in sports and i i so desperately would have liked to have kept that away from them because i understand that it is so hard to keep those things in balance it gets on you it do what amen it gets in you it gets on you it will consume you competition the spirit of competition will consume you every time you hear these boys out here saying we want a guy's game do you know what they're really saying we want to get in here and show each other just how good we really are we want the girls out of the way so they don't get hurt because we aim to compete with everything we've got it's a testosterone party in the church parking lot ain't that right paul chad i started to text you last night and congratulate you i was going to say congratulations you're going to say about what and i was going to say for being invited to play on the senior softball team i heard they invited you to play with the seniors [Music] i don't believe you can't have fun i don't believe you can't have entertainment i don't believe you can't have a volleyball game i don't believe that you can't have a nice wedding i don't believe that you can't enjoy being who you are and carry yourself with some distinction i don't believe any of that but what i believe is that everything must find a place of moderation and some things there's no room for moderation and you need to be away from it 100 altogether and you've got to make sure that you've got a birth why are you even saying it this way because young people will join youth groups in churches and feel apart without having a birth pastors kids will be given positions in a church without having a birth amen deacon's kids without having a birth the problem with that is the next genera their kids come along they don't have a birth daddy didn't have a birth mama didn't have a birth watching a few few episodes on netflix has become cable now cable and it gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger amen brother we need a birth i want you to know you get a red hot fiery birth and the less you will want of this whole world oh you just won't want what you used to want you won't crave what you used to crave you'll cry out for more of god [Music] if you're finding condemnation in this you're finding it somewhere i don't know where you're finding it from because it's not in my heart i want to preach this to you i want to preach this through the internet i want to preach this wherever my voice will go the musicians are coming musicians are getting ready to come i have so much more in my notes i want to share with you but tuesday night i will i wanted to talk about el shaddai i wanted to talk about the benefits of having a word birth when you've got a word birth he stands there ready to supply every need you have every need you have what if i didn't read a whole one but i just went and found a sentence as we're getting ready to close i feel like i've done a terrible job and and not in any way express my heart but i'll try it again i'll keep coming back till i get it in the message broken cisterns paragraph 134 i'll skip the other two he said like father abraham he never pulled he never fretted he never worried he had the word he laid upon el shaddai's breast does that make you uncomfortable it ought not to make you uncomfortable he laid upon el shaddai's breast when abraham was a hundred years old god appeared to him and said i am the almighty the hebrew word el shaddai means the breasted one and you are old and your strength is gone but just lay upon my bosom and nurse your strength from this fountain can you imagine god saying that abraham you're a hundred years old your strength is gone but i'm here to show you what i have just lay your head right here on my chest and find every answer every healing every deliverance every strength what he did he nursed himself to a new body you hear it he said what he did he nursed himself to a new what did he nurse himself to a new body he had the baby i wonder what you and i could nurse ourselves to i wonder what would happen if we were still finding ourself nursing from the from the breasts of el shaddai the one who says ever i'm the fountain of all life i'm the fountain of everything you have need of if you're here in this room and you don't know beyond the shadow of a doubt that you have been born again of the spirit of christ let me close by saying god has no grandchildren you may have parents that believe the truth grandparents that believe the truth great grandparents that believe the truth but that is only a portion of your of your inheritance or your legacy the legacy of your elders you get to enjoy some of the blessing and benefit of that but it does not guarantee your birth it does not guarantee your entrance into the kingdom of god i'm telling you there are seniors there there are there are middle-aged people in the body of christ that have come in from this that or the other denomination having no experience before they came in with god and and they're told things such as if you believe the message you have the holy ghost then the devil has the holy ghost because he knows the truth i'm just stuck i was rushing for you but i'm tired of that i'm not gonna do that somebody's listening to me now questions and answers number three this is it i i believe this is it this is question 354 do your children have to have an experience do your children have to have an experience to have the holy spirit if they see the end time message do they have the holy spirit this is a question ask brother branham in 1964 and here's his answer in 2 18 every one must have an experience your children cannot go in on no other way but the same way you do see they've got to be born again there's no grandchildren in the kingdom of god they're all children they must have it must have an experience with god to go in just the same as you and how can they tell us if you believe the message you have the holy ghost when brother branham corrected that kind of thinking and he said you must have your own experience with god you've got to have the baptism of the holy ghost for yourself would you stand all over this room with me i ashley just play something even before he starts singing you can play that if you want to but just start start playing something here if you can you all you musicians do it for just a minute i want to ask the holy spirit i want to ask the holy spirit to come and speak the hearts here just a moment before we before we begin to worship and before we come to sort out our life with him [Music] i'd be the happiest man in this room if i could believe that every person here has had a real birth with jesus christ my mind is not going to one or another trying to figure out who i'm not doing that at all that's not my place this morning i'm just saying that this is the goal the goal is to get you to a place where you know that you know that you know that you know that you know that you're born again of the spirit of christ and that you've had your own personal experience with the holy ghost that's why we're here we'll grow after that we'll push up after that we'll feast on the word after that we'll grow in the grace of god after that we'll understand more about the message truth after that but we want to know that we know that we know that we know that we've had that experience with god i told you when i preached something like this not too long ago that paul had such a glorious conversion your conversion may not look like paul's but you don't have to have his experience you've got to have yours you've got to meet him with all the faith that you've got and believe that god wants to make a difference in your life i want you to just bow your head just a moment i don't often do a a a altar call like this but if you're in this room right now and you would say to me brother shelly i do not know for sure that i am born again and that i have had a true baptism of the holy ghost and i want to know that i am not trying to be a grandchild i want to know that i am a son of god and i just want to put up my hand and ask for prayer would you do that right now all over this room several hands are going up god bless every one of you in all likelihood many of these that are feeling this have already met god but i appreciate them being sensitive enough to the spirit of the lord that they would want to make sure and they'd go back and check again like the little song that they sung at easter time passover time where the little boy saw the daddy take the blood and put it over the door and the little boy goes to bed and he tries to go to sleep and he hears the sounds going through the city and the cries and screams and he says daddy daddy i want you to go and see one more time would you just check one more time and see if the blood is still there and the daddy said boy you were right there you saw me put the blood you know i put the blood you watched me do it he said i know i did daddy but would you just go one more time and make sure the blood is still there i appreciate the sensitive ones who raise their hand in every altar call or who come forward every time a message like this goes out i appreciate that i'm not calling that doubt this morning i'm telling you you're like that little boy you want to make sure that it's all right and i'd rather be like you i'd rather keep coming back and checking to make sure that everything is all right then to go on and live my life and not care what the word said and not care what my experience is with god if you're across this room and you raised your hand or you didn't raise your hand and you'd like to respond i'm inviting you to come this way right now some are already here for other reasons but or for whatever reason but if you're hearing you just say i want to make sure i want to check it up this morning i'm not ashamed to check it up i want to know that i know that i know that every sin is under the blood and that i'm living a sold out life for jesus christ i want to know that i've had a birth i don't want it to be some grandchild's testimony i want to testify of it firsthand what about you brother what about you sister where do you stand i say this like this if there's one bit of doubt if there's one shred of doubt you just say i want to check up on my birth i'd come i would come right now i wouldn't be ashamed i wouldn't care what anybody thought about me i wouldn't care what anybody said about me at lunch i'd come [Music] look at these sweet young people coming here grandmother coming with them i guess look at them i want to make sure i want to know that every sin is under the blood jesus loves us that much that we don't have to go out of here guessing hoping we're ready we can know that we know that we know that we know that we know that we're ready to meet the lord why what a beautiful what a beautiful response before we pray let's sing a little worship tonight today come on let's worship him and then we'll pray a little bit [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] the answer is open for that [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] it's who you are it's who i am yes it's who i am oh it's who i am [Music] foreign [Music] is oh it's who you are [Music] who i am because you are perfect in all of your ways [Music] i just want to stand here [Music] [Music] here this morning [Music] [Music] covered by the blood of jesus christ [Music] [Music] let him be [Music] may have freedom to serve you lord [Music] everything that is [Music] oh [Music] it's who i am [Music] oh it's who i am you're a good good father for my brothers we're not doubting your words [Music] to make [Music] sure taken place [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] is [Music] it's who you are and i'm loved by you it's who i am [Music] satan would like to have him [Music] in this world may [Music] live for jesus [Music] it's who you are and i'm loved by you it's who i am it's who i am [Music] oh it's who you are [Music] who i am [Applause] [Music]
