TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit [Music] but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right Weist in you the hope a lord [Music] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelly from New Hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama and I'm coming to you again today on behalf of brother Eric Erickson and the entire staff of the gospel channel I'm just delighted for what the Lord is doing through Christian television in this hour you know there's not a lot of good things that can be seen on television around the world but I am so thankful to know that the gospel of Jesus Christ is being proclaimed and I counted a privilege and an honor to come to you today representing the kingdom of God coming to you to talk about the love and the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and we want you to continue to support the gospel channel however the Spirit of the Lord might lead you I know that there are many faithful partners watching this program today and through the years you have sewn your finances to the gospel channel and you by the grace of God are part of the reason why they have been going strong for all of these years and we are constantly praying and believing God for even further expansion we're just excited when we hear from the saints of God across the UK and Scandinavia we're beginning to air also on Omega in Iceland there's just so many exciting things that are taking place and we're just very very thankful that this little ministry has a part you know there's a song that means a lot to me and it has for many many years it concerns our will you know our self will can be a very very strong thing and I believe there's a lot of grace available to us to be able to lay down our will and to take up the will of God but sometimes it's only through brokenness that we truly make the full surrender that is necessary I think about the life of so many of God's generals one particular man of God comes to mind the ministry of brother William Branham and how that before his great ministry that became a worldwide ministry was launched there was a lot of brokenness in his life he had a lot of sacrifices to make and there were a lot of changes that had to take place and I believe that through a lot of that suffering and pain his will was completely broken and laid aside and I believe it was then that the Lord Jesus Christ could step into him as his vessel and use him with an international ministry that is still impacting lives even today and there were many other great men of God and women of God who met a lot of sorrow along the way but because of that sorrow they emptied themselves of their own will and their desire and they allowed the Lord to come and live his life through them I'm not saying that's necessary in every life maybe you are someone who just has a lot of grace to be willing to quickly lay aside your opinion and your thoughts in your will and do the will of God but I have to say it hasn't always been that way with me I've known my share of separations I've known my share of grief and sorrow but I want you to know through it all if I could go back I don't know if I would change a bit of it because every step of the way the Lord Jesus Christ has been near he has been real he has been precious and as the song says the longer I serve him the sweeter he grows when I started out to carry the gospel it's just a small boy many years ago over 40 years ago the grace of God was with me then and I often pray to prayer and sung a song whatever it for my will to break that's what I'll be willing to do a few weeks ago at our little Church in Alabama I sunned that song and I'd like to share it with you by the songwriter Lanny wolf whatever it takes for my will to break Oh Lord that's what I'll be willing to do I hope it'll bless you there's a voice calling me from an old rugged tree and it whispers draw closer to me [Music] world far behind there are new heights to climb and a new life in me you will find for whatever it takes to draw me closer [Music] to You Lord that's what I'll be willing to [Music] for whatever it takes to be more like you that's what I'll be willing to do here's where it gets a little difficult take the dearest things to me if that's how it must be to draw me closer to you let the disappointments come lonely days without the Sun if through sorrow more like you I'll become for whatever it takes to draw me closer to you that's what I'll be willing to do [Music] [Applause] for whatever it takes to be more like you that's what I'll be willing to do take my houses and my land change my dreams and my plans for I'm placing my whole life in your hands and if you call me someday to a land far away Lord I'll go and your will singing with me for whatever takes to draw me closer to you that's what I'll be willing to [Applause] [Music] they're whatever to be more like you that's what I'll be willing to do take the dearest things to me if that's how it must be to draw me closer to you [Music] and let my niece appointments called lonely days without the Sun if in sorrow more like you I become Jesus sing it with me for whatever it takes if you can mean it sing it to draw me closer to you that's what I'll be willing to [Music] [Applause] for whatever Veritate to be more like you that's what I'll be willing to do see if you're willing I'll trade sunshine for rain comfort for pain that's what I'll be willing to [Applause] for whatever it takes for my will to parade that's what I'll be willing to do if you feel you can't would you stand and sing it with me for whatever it takes to draw us closer to you that's what I'll be willing to [Applause] [Music] for whatever [Music] to be like you that's what I'll be willing to do Cygnus I'll trade sunshine for rain comfort for pain that's what I'll be willing [Music] [Applause] [Music] for whatever it takes for my will to breathe take that's what I'll be willing to do yes amen I hope you appreciated the words to that song I think a lot of us can look back over our lives and see those junctions in time when we had to yield a little more of ourselves when we first start out to serve the Lord we are determined to give him everything but there comes times when he requires something of us and we clinch it with a tight fist and because of that there is a breaking that has to take place I'm not going to sell you some glorious life that has no price tag I know the truth is jesus paid it all the truth is salvation is free but I've said for many years a call of God on your life will cost you everything and I just have to believe that there are many of you watching this program today that you didn't start out just to be a church member but you started out because you were wooed and called and drawn by the Holy Spirit of God and you wanted more than just a Sunday religion you wanted to walk the supernatural life that perhaps you read about him the Word of God I know there are so many denominations in the world today and so many different ideas about what God can and cannot do today what He desires to do or maybe he doesn't want to do yet today but when I read the book of Acts I don't find anything in there that God is not willing to do for us and through us today if we can have faith to believe yes I believe that he is the same yesterday and today and forever and I still believe that through Jesus Christ there is power to heal the sick to cast out devils and to raise the dead in my early ministry as an attendant evangelist traveling up and down the East Coast sometimes dragging an old canvas tent and a bus with a trailer behind it I wasn't old enough to drive even in those days and always had a staff with me who would help to drive and to put up the tent I saw miracles and I know those miracles are still available today in the same way that they were all 30-plus years ago I saw the blind eyes open and the deaf ears unstopped I've seen cancerous tumors fall off under the floor in a service where someone was receiving prayer I've seen God or swallowed and I've seen massive growths in someone's stomach deflate by the authority of Jesus Christ in such a manner that women would leave the service holding their clothes because they they instantly had such a change in their physical body when the tumor disappeared I've seen God do so many wonderful things and I know that he is still able this perhaps may not be the the age or the season of divine healing with the miracles that that we saw in America in the UK and the great revivals of the 50s and 60s but it's not because God has changed it's not because Jesus is no longer doing these kinds of things or no longer desires to do them it's because so much has changed with the church and so much has changed with what people are willing to dare to believe God to do why don't you turn your faith loose here you have just worshipped agreed with a song whatever it takes Lord for my will to break so you're submitting your will to him saying Lord not my will but your will be done and while you're in a moldable and pliable moment like this why don't you go ahead and dare to believe that anything you need God to do in your life he is able and willing to do perhaps he has a divine appointment with you right now and that's why there is a gospel channel that's why there's a new hope revival ministries that's willing to come by means of the gospel channel and speak into your life I know that with the fast-paced life that people live today to sit in front of the television for a solid hour and hear a gospel message it's not what everybody wants to do and yet there you are and many of you are not just sitting here today watching this program but you have watched other programs here on the gospel channel some that we have done and and many others as well why is that is it because you're bored and you have nothing else to do I don't think that's it I think that God has an appointment with you I think you're hungry for the things of the Lord I think you desire I think there's some of you watching today who have a hunger that you don't even know how to explain or Express I think there's some of you that that have a closeted hunger in other words I think that you keep it to yourself maybe you go to church with a wonderful group of people but you don't tell anybody just how hungry you are for the deeper things of God and how you desire to see God move in your life in a supernatural way as we have heard about him doing in time past and we've read about him doing in the scripture maybe you're a little embarrassed to let your Sunday School class members know that that you're just tired of Church as usual there's something deep stirring within you and so you get your you you get a little fix you get a little stirring when you meet us here on the gospel channel you know that's perfectly all right but I can tell you right now but eventually when you get full of God's Word you begin to feel his life working in you in a personal and supernatural way you will not be able to keep it to yourself your very life your very character the atmosphere that you carry when you go out it will certainly betray you it will certainly eventually get out on you they're going to know and this is exactly how it's supposed to work any ministry that we do even any witnessing that we do for the cause of Christ it should be an overflow of what God is doing in our life personally as individuals it's not just about learning more so that we can do more it's really about becoming more of what God wants us to become it's it's a transformation that takes place and with transformation often there is a commissioning I'd like to share a portion of Scripture with you today that's not going to be uncommon to you in fact I think just about everybody knows the story of Moses and how he stood before that great bush that was burning with fire and yet it was not consumed but let's look at it today maybe we will have the grace to make it a little more personal Exodus chapter 3 beginning in verse 2 and the angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto Him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground holy ground I like this encounter that Moses had with God very much because there are so many lessons that can be applied in principles that can be understood in our own life when God desires to transform us by the word I think most every program that we have done thus far for the gospel channel has been focusing around the Word of God let me remind you today that when I say the Word of God I'm not just referring to the Bible which is the written record of God's Word it is inspired of God recorded by holy men of God who were moved upon by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit anything man touches translates reproduces it can sometimes get the fingerprint of man even the translators had choices decisions to make when they were choosing English words for words that had been recorded in Greek and some of them recorded in Aramaic and Hebrew but this Bible contains the infallible Word of God without mistake but I'm not just talking about the printed record of God's Word we've been also emphasizing the person of the word his name is the Lord Jesus Christ he is Yeshua our Messiah our salvation our deliverer he is the Living Word recently when you and I were together here on the broadcast we mentioned John chapter 1 verse 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God skipping down some verses it says and the word became what which word the word that was with God the word that was God that same word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth so our Lord Jesus Christ was a perfect representation of the Father while in the earth it's a beautiful thing that the word the logos could become flesh in the body of our Lord Jesus Christ that same eternal spirit that said let there be light that same voice that cried out out of the darkness let there be light that is the same spirit that is the same voice that was embodied in our Lord Jesus Christ and that same spirit and that same voice and that same presence that same Living Word can now be in the life of the believer by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and a full surrender to every word of God that means that in you can be the voice of God in you can be the presence of God in you can live and move and dwell the very life and the very Spirit of the Almighty God the same anointing the same manifest presence that was in the Lord Jesus Christ is available to the believer you say wait a minute preacher where do you get an idea like that from the written record of God's Word otherwise known as the Bible the book reveals to us that God chose a temple as a symbol he chose a tabernacle first as a symbol he even chose his own earthly body as a symbol all speaking to us he took his own physical body and used it in teaching examples for instance when he said you see that temple you can tear it down and in three days my father will race it up again many did not understand that he was talking about his body the temple of the eternal spirit of the Father remember how the scripture bears that out so all of these dwelling places of God Tabernacle temple even in the body of our precious Lord Jesus Christ all of these things were pointing to what God was looking for and that was he desired to Tabernacle to indwell to come and live inside more than one house not just one tabernacle one temple one body of our Lord Jesus Christ but as the New Testament teaches us he was looking for a many membered body he was looking for a corporate group of people that he could individually live inside of bringing the fullness of all that he is not just all that he was but all that he is he brings that when he comes to live inside of you that is a supernatural life that's more than Church anity and that's more than Christianity light that is the full expression of what God is looking for in the end time we should focus on him in this hour when things are so uncertain around us we need a bright spot in our life we need an everyday walk an everyday relationship and experience with Jesus car I was speaking to the church last night Tuesday night is our midweek service instead of Wednesday night and I was wanting to make sure that they knew that I have the same struggles that they have at time to get above my emotions to get above my circumstances I mean I can get upset I can get angry I can get discouraged I can get frustrated it's a good thing my wife isn't here because she'd be saying the loudest Amen it happens in our natural life but I've learned that I have a choice I mean I am the only one who can make the choice to get above that and to hear what God is trying to say to me in every situation that I face in life I have to be honest with you and tell you that some of the greatest instructions or strategies that I have received from the Lord in my entire ministry have come on the heels of the seasons of the greatest frustration I have ever known so frustrated that I didn't know whether to go to the ride or go to the left in fact I really didn't want to go either way just wanted to stop going and all and in that moment realizing what is going on what am i allowing the enemy to do what am i allowing my own mind to do to me and when we get to that place and were able to recognize it we come to ourselves it's an awakening just like the prodigal son down in the Pigpen all of a sudden he came to himself and he said what am I doing here my father has hired servants that are eating higher on the hog you can excuse the pun they're eating a little higher on the hog than I am I'm in the Pigpen they're eating beautiful food at father's house and they're just servants I believe I'll go home I'll ask father to forgive me and I won't ask him to restore me to sonship I'll just ask - let me be as one of the hired servants you know how the rest of the story went the father wouldn't hear of his own son being a hired servant and so he brought the ring and the robe that signet ring that would give the son restored authority to conduct business in the house of the father and on behalf of the father and that robe of acceptance and he killed the fatted calf and made a feast there was so much of a doodoo was made that the elder brother looking on he got quite jealous didn't he we have those awakening moments sometime when we are so frustrated we don't know which way to go we don't know what we're supposed to be doing and all of a sudden we just get quiet we just say lord help me let me find grace in your sight and we come to that moment of awakening it's like a light bulb turns off but we say hey wait a minute Lord you have this you've got the instruction and so the truth is some of the greatest strategy and direction that I've ever received for ministry has come at the end of a season like that where I just was almost to the point of putting up my hands in the air and saying I give up I just quit never desiring to give up on my relationship with the Lord but just deciding hey I just don't want to work all all the time and every day of my life for the kingdom of God you can feel quite unappreciated you can get all kinds of emotions going on you experience it in your own family life the enemy tells you nobody cares you go out of the house every day and nobody would hardly care if you didn't come back through the door at night the devil's got lies for every circumstance every situation that's going on he knows how to put his finger on it and tell you all kinds of things about it but his opinion doesn't amount to a hill of beans it's what God's word has to say and the Bible says with every temptation he'll make a way of escape in the Bible tells us if the trying of our faith this trying of our patience is working in us a greater glory a greater transformation so that we can discover and fulfill the real reason why we were born we talked about that the last time we were together now getting back to our text Moses is standing here on the mountain maybe looking for something you know he was a shepherd after all and the angel of the Lord appears to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and he saw that this bush was on fire and yet the bush itself was not being consumed God was really speaking to Moses about his own life he was really telling Moses if I put my fire on you I'll burn out the interior I'll refine your character I'll burn out the dross in your life but I won't destroy you you know there's a fire that destroys and there's a fire that refines and the Bible talks about both of them and they're both fire but God wants to fill his servants with refining fire fire that burns out the dross fire that purifies us like gold this is what the scripture talks about the fiery furnace of affliction and trials I just have a feeling if you've been watching this program this long you're probably one of those that spent some time in the fiery furnace of affliction but didn't God come can't you testify to your neighbor that he came we had a precious sister in our church many years ago who has gone on to be with the Lord an african-american sister and she used to saying he may not come when you warn him but he's right on time and you know I found this to be true in my life maybe the first time I call it seems that he doesn't come but he comes he comes in his timing and Kent most of you watching this program and when I say most of you I mean if you can't if you can't recognize that God has come to your rescue it's simply because you haven't taken the time to consider it if you started taking time to consider the dark moments of your life you called on the Lord maybe your circumstances didn't change immediately maybe they didn't change at all but he came and he strengthened you and he undergirded you and he poured grace over your life and you kept going there are many elderly people who depend on the gospel Channel for their church for their fellowship they hear the word and receive the anointing of the Lord unable to go out and maybe weather changes or our some are shut-in and not able to go out at all and if we could turn this camera around and put a microphone in the hand of the saints of God many of which again watching this program right now and allow them to give their personal testimonies I know that everyone watching would be encouraged when you begin to hear of the faithfulness of God we read it in the Bible but when we when we began to hear it in our own time that God has been faithful he wants us to have an encounter with him that settles some issues maybe there's some doubts maybe there's still still some struggles going on in your life and I don't know that God will call you up on the mountain and appear to you out of a bush but he'll meet you he'll meet you in your living room right now he'll meet you in the parlor wherever you're sitting right now the presence of the Lord is willing to meet you if you call on him in faith believing I believe that he can meet you and that he will meet you and that he desires to meet you it's important to recognize his faithfulness to us in the past it's also important that when God begins to do things in our life now we recognize it and we honor him and we begin to give him thanks I like what Moses did Moses saw this angel of the Lord appearing to him in a flame of fire calling out to him and Moses said a very smart thing I might add I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw that Moses was going to to take some time and we need to take some time to turn our attention toward God and what he desires to say to us in this in this life and in this moment in our lives that's why we've spent so many programs emphasizing the word it's because this is one of the major ways that God shows up in our life is by the written record of his word which leads us to a relationship with Christ the Living Word this this Bible this written record of the word has the ability and the potential to do to cause a change to begin to take place in your life leading you to that real encounter with the Living Word one verse of scripture by inspiration by the Holy Spirit allowing it to become a revelation to you I tell you it's like lighting the fire it's like a spark catching on you're reading it and all of a sudden it becomes alive to you and it's like it's spreading through the layers of your soul mind will and emotion I tell you sometimes I just take the Bible and ask the Lord where he would have me to read what He desires to say to me from the word and before it's over I'm on my knees because he speaks so roundly from his word I don't want you to think that it's only your interaction with a written page that I'm preaching I want you to understand that God wants to meet you at the printed page of his word but he wants to show up in your life as much much more than just a printed page he wants to show up in your life as a living reality and your response this is one of the things that we have emphasized in our programs together is that our response to the word is vitally important to position us to have a real encounter with the Living Word when we read and God begins to say this is this is something I want to lead you toward we read it and we can say wait I hear this now I'm reading this this makes sense I think this is what God wants to do in my life follow that pray into that what does that mean preacher it means all right lord I read right here that you want to establish me in righteousness as you're planting in the same manner that that someone who owns an orchard would plant a tree and with the expectation after planning that tree that it's going to require nurture and its nurture and it's going to require care and it's going to require labor but in the end there is the expectation that that tree is going to bear fruit and the fruit is going to be determined by the kind of tree that is planted and when we recognize that the Scriptures teach that we are the righteous planting of the Lord we are the trees let me say it in an easier way we are the trees of righteousness that God is planting in the earth in this last hour all right you read that in the Bible you read say for instance you're reading and you someone where God talks about the righteous man the godly man again being like a tree bringing forth fruit in the right season etc and Yuri then and then you begin to say Lord you said in your word you wanted men to be godly and that you wanted to establish them as your planting in the earth and you wanted to display your righteousness through your orchard through your planted trees it's its symbols I understand but it's a powerful way to pray I read here where you said that and so Lord I'm gonna claim that for myself and then it becomes a prayer and not just a verse of scripture you talk about I hope you I hope this doesn't sound absolutely fanatical to you but if it does I'm almost I'm almost ready to apologize but not quite because I think there's enough of you that have never tried this you've never tried it for instance Psalm 1 it says and he shall be this is blessed is the man blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and verse 3 and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper that's more than a poem that's more than a dusty old poem it's actually a beautiful poem but it's so much more than that it's the living promise of God it's the utterance it was actually a spiritual utterance through the psalmist it was a song sung unto the Lord and it was prophetic in the sense that it was revealing to us the heart and the mind of God so let me let me make it personal in the heart and mind of God it is his will and desire for you to be a man a woman that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly you don't receive your counsel from the ungodly you you find your counsel in the Word of God when you need advice when you need answers to life's questions you find it in the word or you seek out those who have given their lives to the Word of God so that they can give you counsel based on the word not based on the current trend it is the will of God for us not to stand in the way of sinners that simply means we have to be careful about who we make covenant with and who we make commitment and and this kind of connection for instance in marriage in business the Bible said we should not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers but it doesn't mean that we shouldn't be a witness it doesn't mean that we shouldn't minister and love and we should be light Jesus was not ashamed to eat with sinners he didn't think that it was going to defile him to to show himself a light to those who are walking in darkness but this scripture means we're not going to make covenant with with sinners we're gonna be joined with other righteous trees we're going to join ourselves with other right if you're looking for a companion in life you're not going to find a godly companion in the pub in the bar somewhere drunk on a stool if you're a godly man you're not going to find a godly woman in a place like that you're going to find the companion that God has for you and you're going to recognize that person because they're going to be seeking for the same thing you're seeking for desiring the same thing that you're desiring so it means we it is not your Will O God for me to to coven it with sinners in that manner or to sit in the seat of the scornful my my lord it is not your will for me to be scornful and critical and you know have an unnecessary and unwanted opinion about everything until I become so cynical and so critical this is a very common thing for all of us in this hour we can we can get influenced by news and we can get influenced by fake news and we can become so scornful until we we just see the the rotten in everything god it's not your will for me to be that way but but you said right here Lord that you'd if I'm going to be righteous I should find my delight in your instruction King James says law that word law is the instructions of God does that sound archaic this that sounds so old-fashioned that you can't grasp that God right now 2018 God wants us to find our instructions for life in this written record of his word and through our encounters with Christ the Living Word you're never going to receive anything in your relationship with the Living Word that's contrary to the written record of his word because he is one with his word he wants to give us instructions even today so as you're praying this you'd say Lord your word says that you'd that that you it is your desire for the righteous to delight in your instruction and you said here that in that instruction the righteous man meditates day and night so Lord I'm asking you for grace to keep your word in my heart day and night and when I'm in a situation where I have a choice of becoming angry and bitter and hateful I want to remember that your word says that there's a tender way to stand for what is right there are times that a gift in secret can pacify anger there the scripture talks about heaping coals of fire on people's heads by returning kindness by passing along kind instead of maybe what someone deserves sometimes you can encounter people in public who are so angry so so bitter and you wonder what you've done maybe a waiter a server in a restaurant and you wonder what you've done and the temptation is wait a minute you're being paid to bring me my food and you're gonna show me a little bit of respect this is what we feel like sometimes we want to do but if we're meditating in God's Word day and night we will remember that there's a right answer here somewhere in God's instruction for how to deal with someone who's misusing you that way and there's a way to speak life and light to that person who's going through something only the Lord knows the times that he's used people strangers even to speak light into my life when I was facing some darkness and you and I can be used that way but you get down here to this verse that we were emphasizing in the beginning Lord you said that your righteous men and women were to be trees planted by the rivers of water and that if we would be planted by your living spirit water because your spirit is life remember jesus said out of men's bellies shall flow rivers of living water this is what happens when you're filled with the Spirit of God it doesn't just stay capped up inside of you dammed up inside of you it it has force and it wants to come out and he wants to fill your life with those Living Waters so that they can spread to somebody else like that waiter who's treated you rough when serving your dinner he wants to open up your belly and let that life and the light of Jesus Christ shine through you so you're praying this back to him and Lord you said if I'd stay planted by the rivers of your water that I would bring forth fruit in season hallelujah not a tree that casts its fruit before the season meaning drop in fruit on the ground that is not ripened the tree turns loose or cast its fruit out of season then it becomes a waste it rots on the ground but Lord you said that if I'd keep myself planted by the rivers of water that I would bring forth fruit in my season in the right season and that my leaf would not wither and whatsoever I do would prosper again that may sound very very silly or old-fashioned to somebody watching that you would take God's Word and pray it back like that but I'm telling you you would be surprised how he will speak to you when you fellowship with him through his word this encounter that Moses had it commissioned him for the rest of his life and God just said I want you to come closer but you're gonna have to take off your shoes you're going to have to come barefooted before me because even the ground that you're standing on is holy ground you know God was wanting to reveal to Moses there's something higher than the bush my fire in that bush is what makes that bush special my calling on your life Moses is what makes you special and I'm telling you the same is true today it's God's call on your life that makes you unique it's God's call on your life that makes you special in this hour and we may not feel very special sometime you know how that works but it's not about feeling it's about the promises of God I just feel like there's a fiery evangelist that that that's yet to be born watching this program right now and when I say yet to be born I mean in the spirit not in the natural I just believe that there are many who will see this program who God has a witness in your mouth he's got a testimony in your mouth you've just got to open it up and let it out he wants to use your influence and I also believe that there are some watching this program that you have not surrendered your life to the Lord and I'm telling you you're not living the life you were created to live unless you have surrendered to God's will for your life he wants to to change us by His Word and Commission us into the reason why we were born and the reason why I brought this today was because I was still thinking about John when we were together recently we talked about John seeing this experience of the Lord Jesus standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and his reaction to the glory and splendor of the Lord was to fall flat on his face and the Lord reached out put his hand on him fear not John I'm the first and the last I've got this I like it when Jesus says I am Alpha and Omega I am The Aleph and the Tov I'm the first and the last the beginning in the end because he's saying what I've started don't you worry I'm more than able to finish maybe you're one of those who sees the condition of the world and you see the condition of the church and you think that the kingdom of God is fizzling out well I want to tell you in the name of the Lord you're wrong if that's your thought in your opinion and that's the philosophy that you've accepted in this hour you're absolutely wrong and I tell you that with boldness the kingdom of God is not fizzling the work of Jesus Christ is not going undone he is doing wonderful marvelous glorious things in the lives of his people in this hour we are finishing up preparation in the spirit to accomplish great things for God and then I'm looking for the coming of the Lord oh yes I'm one of those who believes in the coming of the Lord I believe that he's coming for his people one of these days and I'm going to keep living toward that day looking toward that day working until that day believing for transformation to continue in my life in my family and my community of faith and wherever you are watching this program right now Father I thank you right now that you are God's supreme and sovereign you are Lord of all and you are worthy of all praise I bless your name hallelujah thank you Lord and I thank you for every person watching this program whether they're watching it on Christian television or seeing it by YouTube or however they have come in contact with it today I thank you for their life I believe that they are absolutely savable if they're not saved I pray that you will give them grace to call on your name and find life that only comes from knowing you as a personal Lord and Savior I pray for the discouraged right now that they would not buy into this idea that there's nothing happening and in the kingdom of God and among God's people but that they would begin to reach into your word pray it back to you in the spirit and watch you perform mighty works in their lives and in their families lives for the glory of God I just pray right now for a healing to flow in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to the sick and the needy watching this program right now with your stripes we are healed and I'm asking you Lord to let somebody fellowship with you in your suffering right now and touch that place of healing until virtue flows into their body and they see a miraculous recovery and a change lord I thank you for releasing provision to Bible believers watching this program right now who are oppressed of the enemy and their finances and they're doing their part to support the work of the king and the enemy is trying to absolutely squeeze them out of having a life I asked you Lord to release help for them also and we lift up every need in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory once again thank you for spending this time with me in the Word of God and until we meet again God richly bless you press in to the Word of God its life today bye bye for now [Music] [Applause] you
