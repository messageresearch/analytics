TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit [Music] but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right twiced in you the hope award [Music] hello there I'm Pastor Steven Shelley of New Hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama and I'm coming to you again this week in partnership with the gospel channel I'm just thrilled to have another opportunity to come and to bring you greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and to give you a lesson today from the Word of God I want to thank each and every one of you for writing us and for calling the prayer line I just wanted to show you this stack of prayer requests this is a stack that has come in already this month and we're just a really a few days not even two weeks yet into the first month and all of these prayer requests have come in and a few of these are testimonies which lets me know that God is answering prayer and so I'm adding these to the folder and lately and our services in Alabama we've been lifting these prayer requests lifting this folder up before the Lord and we are continuing to agree and some of you some of these requests came in weeks ago but we're holding on to them I don't want to just say well we've prayed a time or two and we'll toss them out no I want to keep bringing them before the Lord and believing that God is going to meet your need and just as I was sitting here before we started recording I read a prayer request and a testimony from a dear sister in the United Kingdom who said she was walking down the street of her neighborhood and someone asked her have you seen the latest broadcast with Pastor Steven and you know that encouraged me it blessed me to know that neighbor is sharing with neighbor and her testimony was that they loved me in the UK well that means something to me because I also love the people of the UK and I don't remember right now the first time I went to the United Kingdom exactly what year it was but it's been quite a few years ago now over 20 years and the first time I ever win and I've been quite a few times and we have had some wonderful meetings in the UK in both in churches and in conferences and even in hotel rooms and you know I'd like to come back I would like to come back and have services with some of you who watch this program so faithfully so you pray and I'll pray with you and as the Lord opens the door and leads we'll come and have a meeting together it would be a real honor to be able to shake your hand and to meet you personally I am just so thankful for the gospel channel and it's outreaches and what God is accomplishing in people's lives I think if you've been watching the programme over the course of the last couple of months we have been doing a series that we called schemes and devices now I believe there were 11 episodes in that series and I mentioned to you the last time in episode 11 that we were praying about continuing the thought taking it in in a slightly different direction and I've really prayed about whether or not the Lord would have me to kind of get into some of these things and I feel his liberty and his leadership to do so and so I'm praying today that God will use these words this teaching this lesson to become a key to unlock some things in your life to give you some strategy for both some strategy also for repentance and I truly believe that God wants to help us win the daily battle that we fight as children of God we studied as I said a moment ago 11 episodes of schemes and devices and our theme Scripture I'm gonna carry that scripture over and I'm going to call the next few times that we are together demonic doorways and we're going to discuss some of the most common doorways that the enemy seems to be able to use to approach us in our life some again it's schemes and devices but specifically demonic doorways I'm gonna carry our theme scripture over into this new series 2nd Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 11 lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices and it's been many weeks ago that we started studying using that scripture as our foundation and in that first episode I believe it was I mentioned a quote from Corrie ten Boom where she said it's a poor soldier indeed who does not recognize the enemy how important it is for us to recognize our enemy one thing most of us have learned on our Christian journey is that Satan hates exposure and he will go to extreme measures to remain hidden well we're calling him out of his hiding place yes we're turning the light of God's Word on him and we're exposing all of those crevices and corners those little nooks and crannies that he likes to hide in he feels like that he will be undetected but you know I believe according to the Word of God we must learn his devices we must learn his way so that we will not be taken by surprise are caught off guard so I want us to look today to the Old Testament if you will lamentations chapter five and verse seven our fathers have sinned and are not and we have borne their iniquities now this is an interesting portion of Scripture and it is a scripture that introduces a theme of how we might bear the iniquity of our forefathers what kind of an impact what kind of an influence does the life of our parents and our grandparents and our great-grandparents have on our lives today well when I start looking at this subject there is a word that is commonly used in charismatic and Pentecostal circles you'll often hear people speak of generational curses and I know that there are people who argue on both sides of this subject there are many who are fully persuaded that there is something called a generational curse that can affect us and if we don't deal with that issue it will affect our children and grandchildren and then there are other people who say that when we come to Jesus every curse against us is automatically broken and we automatically receive total deliverance of any influence or any residual effect from the life of our forefathers I want you to know that I believe the scripture is actually somewhere in the middle and I want to talk to you about that and we may use the term generational curses because I think that is a term that we can come to understand and let me give you just a very simple definition of what a generational curse is a generational curse is basically a defilement that was passed down from one generation to another I think that is a very good definition for you to hold on to a defilement that was passed down from one generation to another now if you completely oppose that idea you would have to ignore a scripture in Psalm 51 and five that we're very familiar with where the psalmist said behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me the psalmist is talking about from the innocence of the womb I was born with a sinful nature and I was born under the influence of iniquity now he doesn't particularly say that it was the sins of his parents but he did say in sin in a fallen nature my mother did conceive me and so I believe it's important for us to look at this subject I believe that there are many people perhaps watching this program today who have never prayed a prayer of repentance Debray what I like to call a generational cycle it is certainly a curse because it's something that perhaps we did nothing to to inherit it we didn't necessarily choose it for ourselves but we carry a predisposition to a certain behavior to a certain addiction and we're going to talk about that just in just a few moments and so I like to look at it as a generational cycle or a generational pattern and what we mean by that is watching a behavior passed down from generation to generation to generation even brain science is telling us now that this is not only a spiritual concept but a very natural concept and I think everyone watching the program today would agree that we are certainly products of our DNA of our genetics and we are also products of our environment and so everything about our environment is not negative surely there are also positive things in our life when we seem to have had more negative things going on than positive things then of course we talk more about the negative but but in all of our lives as children of God he has been watching carefully over us even when we were not completely surrendered to him and even when we were not aware of his great love and his great care his great concern for us because I believe according to the New Testament before I was ever born before I was ever formed in my mother's womb God my Creator knew me I believe as the scripture says all of my days were written in his book before I was ever born I believe that God knew my life he knew my my makeup my physical makeup and I believe that God knew my choices I also believe that in his foreknowledge he knew ultimately whether or not I would choose to serve Him to live for him to surrender my life to him and I believe that by his foreknowledge of my life before I was ever born he developed a plan and a destiny for me unfortunately all of the things that have happened in my life are not good but as I have told you before they were for my good the scripture promises that all things work together for the good of them who love the Lord and to them who are the called according to his purpose and I believe that many of you watching this program right now are the called according to the purposes and promises of God and I believe that all of us could look back over our life and say that we certainly have borne the influence of our environment many of us grew up in a very loving home where there was both a loving mother and a loving father and a warm inviting nourishing environment every day of our childhood others of us grew up with different circumstances in my particular home my parents divorced when I was five years old and I was raised by my mother alone and with the help and the love and the support of my grandparents with my father being completely absent from my life and so there were there were effects there there were things that I carry in my life I look things differently perhaps because of my background what I'm more concerned about today is how the life choices of my parents and grandparents may affect me in my spiritual life and how the enemy seems to take advantage of this kind of a generational cycle some of it is psychological but some of it is also very spiritual and we have authority over those things which are spiritual and we also can believe for healing and deliverance for the aspect of a generational cycle that is psychological I believe that God wants to make us whole wh o L e I believe that he wants to preserve us and give us wholeness and health in our spirit in our soul and in our body and I do not believe that we are ultimately long-term cursed by the sins the iniquities the choices and behaviors of our parents but I do believe that we have a responsibility as spirit filled believers to break the cycle to stop the cycle and we do that by the power of the Cross every curse is dealt with by the precious blood of Jesus Christ that was shed for you and I on the cross of Calvary I believe that with everything that I am let's look at a few Old Testament Scriptures that speak of how the iniquity is carried forward from generation to generation in Exodus chapter 34 verses 6 and 7 and the Lord passed by before him and pro claimed the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious long-suffering and abundant in goodness and truth keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children and upon the children's children unto the third and to the fourth generation I believe this scripture is clear the influence the effects of our fathers and grandfathers and great-grandfather's the decisions that they made certainly caused us to be influenced and to be affected there's no doubt in my mind Leviticus chapter 26 and verse 38 and 39 and you shall perish among the heathen and the land of your enemies shall eat you up and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies lands and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them now why would we have these two very strong verses portions of scripture about the iniquity of the fathers being carried on to another generation because God was dealing with the rebellion in the hearts of his own children we're talking about the children of Israel we're talking about the peculiar treasure of the Lord he chose the Israelites he chose the seed of Abraham and he chose that family line in fact his desire was that through the seed of Abraham the entire world and all the nations of the world would be blessed he loved them he provided for them he even provided for their sins for their iniquities he was so meticulous and careful to bring down a set of instructions with again minut details how to cover how to deal with how to make an offering for how to offer an atonement for even the smallest infraction against the instruction and the will of God for the lives of his children and yet as easy as God made it we read in the Bible there was constant rebellion in their heart and no matter how the Lord covered how he provided a way of escape it seems that they continuously generation after generation hardened their heart hardened their heart disregarding God's instruction totally rebelling against the way that God had established for them and because of this rebellion one generation would would create an atmosphere of anger an atmosphere of rejecting God's Way an atmosphere of sin and rebellion and of course the influence of that the teaching of that the example that one generation would set would certainly encompass the next generation and the next generation and the next generation and so God was actually giving the children of Israel an opportunity to the third and the fourth generation to come back to him to repent of their sins and the sins of the generations before to once and for all break the generational curse break the generational cycle and set the next generation free once and for all I don't know if that makes any sense to you or not but when I read these verses of Scripture I want to understand what it is that God was accomplishing by visiting the sins of one generation on another generation I know enough about the nature of God and the character of God as revealed by the word to know that God is a God of justice of equity of righteousness and in no way would God want to visit another generation in an unfair unjust way but he created this cycle that we read about in these verses of Scripture for for mercy's sake to give that generation an opportunity to just come clean before him and say we have followed in the ways of our fathers and for that we humbly repent we repent for our sins we repent for the sins of the generations before us and we align our hearts hear me we align our hearts with the ways that you have set aside for us and we align our hearts with the instructions that you have given us in your word and and Lord Oh father God let this cycle of generational iniquity be broken let this cycle of generation curse be broken that it not be visited upon my children and upon my grandchildren may they not have to pay in any way may they not be influenced may they not have a predisposition toward any of the things that have become cycles in my generation and the generations before me does that help you at all can you understand that this was not a judgment of God this visiting of the iniquity on another generation was actually a merciful act it was God saying not only can you repent for the sins of your generation but you can break the influence you can break the cycle and the pattern of the past few generations so that truly the generation that follows they can come with a clean slate they don't have to start off in the in the same vulnerability and verse 18 the Lord is long-suffering and of great mercy here's what you've got to know about God he is long-suffering full of mercy great mercy the the writer said forgiving iniquity and transgression and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children unto the third and fourth generation so we see this repeating what has already been said for us in the book of Exodus now let's move on just a moment I think as we mentioned just a moment ago we inherit traits we inherit preferences from our parents and all of these traits and preferences are not particularly positive and the influence of those traits and preferences not only affect us our lives but they often affect the lives of those closest to us especially our blood relatives but I want you to know that it's not just my blood family that's related to me by blood that can also bear some of the effect of cycles and patterns that are going on in my life from generations before but also those around me because it has a way of bending us in a certain direction I don't know about you but I don't want to be bent toward anything but God's standard of truth I don't want to be trying to figure out how to justify my unbelief I don't want to spend my life trying to justify my bad choices and I don't even want to use my parents and grandparents and great-grandparents as an excuse for making the same bad choices that they made I want to be bent toward God's Word I want to lean with everything that I am toward the truth that God has established for my life and for my children and if he tarries my children's children when we acquire a sinful habit or a belief that negatively affects our life or those around us this could be defined as a generational curse or a generational cycle I'm going to read that note again when we acquire a sinful habit or a belief that negatively affects our lives are those around us this is known as a generational curse or a generational cycle and again this can be brought upon us by the influenced by the atmosphere of being around our loved ones but I believe that it can also be a trick of the enemy to try to put this on our lives in a demonic way I believe that there are evil spirits who would like to take the the effects of what has gone in our previous generations and I believe they're demons that would like to attach themselves to our lives to force us into the same pattern and into the same cycle and you know what we say no we say no we say even if alcohol has been a predominant spirit in in our prior generations father grandfather great-grandfather I say no I say no to to the influence of a spirit that would desire to cause me to be addicted to alcohol I say a big no I think you need to say a big no and I'm gonna say even a bigger no to my children and to my children's children this has to stop and so I want to make sure you are following me closely I believe that we pick up some of these things in a very natural way the influence the effect if we grow up in a home where our father came in from work and he drowned his stress with alcohol then as you see that over and over and over again it it becomes very common to you you expect that when Dad walks through that door if I don't know what I guess I guess also in the UK I was gonna say here in America it would be quite common that Dad would walk in the door and go to the refrigerator and pull out a six-pack of beer and drink it all until his stress is gone or it may be as it used to be in the UK come in and put his things down maybe and and walk down the street to the corner pub and and and drink a few pints and and forget about is sorrow and as we grow up watching that happen this this becomes like a signboard in our brain that says when you get stressed when you get tired that is the way you handle it and so that behavior gets repeated from generation to generation because of influence and atmosphere but I'm also saying and this is what I want you to be very aware of if you and I are able to recognize that about our own family history if we are sometimes able to recognize behaviors in our own life that remind us tremendously of our mother or of our father or of one of our grandparents if we can recognize that so can the enemy of our spirit so can the enemy of God and so what he will do is take great advantage of what we have already recognized in our family history and I believe that he will assign demon spirits to do everything within their realm of power within their sphere of power to make sure that you get locked into what we could call a generational curse or a generational cycle I believe those demon spirits then can manipulate circumstances in our lives and really there are many many ways that they can help ensure that you and I are going to look to the pub look to the to the beer to the alcohol to the drugs to the to the sex whatever it is as we have seen modeled before they're going to do everything they can to lock us into that kind of a cycle and we will carry on that same behavior sometimes almost automatically really just making the same choice you know we think we're just following along with life not even realizing that they're demon spirits that have been assigned against us to put us in that prison of addiction and how did they know that we would even be vulnerable to such a thing how did they even know that we would even be tempted by such a thing because they are aware of our generational heritage they're aware of how our parents handled things our grandparents and our great-grandparents so see there are many different aspects of how this generational pattern or generational cycle can form I want you to know it enough about it understand enough about it so that you can break its hold and so that you can scatter those demon spirits perhaps that have been a sign to lock you in listen I've got some hang-ups in my life I have recognized some hang-ups along the way but but the heart of every parent especially those who love God is to shield the next generation shield our children if if say for instance I were to have a way of of relieving stress that was not a godly way I wouldn't want to pass that on to my children I would want them to be free from that I would want them to learn that there's a biblical way to deal with anxiety and stress yes there's a Bible way and that is by meditating on the Word of God that's by drawing yourself close up to Jesus and leaning on him and loving on him and giving him your hearts devotion and giving him praise and celebrating the past victories of your life there's a biblical way to hide in him until the storm passes by but if my children see me running to something that is not godly and not healthy then when they face similar circumstances of stress they could very easily pick up the same thing that they have seen modeled before them it would be harder for them to make a better decision because of those spirits that I recognize are assigned to that next generation to make sure that that cycle continues I tell you the devil is slick and he is sly but he is defeated in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because we're uncovering him in your family by the Word of God in Deuteronomy chapter 5 and verse 9 this is talking a little bit about a cultic practices and idolatry if you should read ahead in verse 9 thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them nor serve them for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children unto the third and fourth generation listen at this phrase of them that hate me of them that hate me I'm going to read it again because I think this is an important phrase to help us interpret all of the other scriptures that we've read and at least a dozen more that we're not going to read today but that also mentioned this concept of perhaps the father's eating sour grapes and the children's teeth being set on edge are visiting the iniquity down to the third and fourth generation but listen at this verse because it helps us gain perspective of the other verses thou shall not bow down thyself unto them nor serve them for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children unto the third and the fourth generation of them that hate me this what what this helps me to see is that this is a cycle that just continues among those who disregard the Lord he said hate me and and you know it's easier to hate God than what a lot of people are willing to see it's actually easier to hate God what do you mean by that brother Shelley well I mean the Bible said if you love me Jesus is saying God is saying to us if you love me you will keep my Commandments and if you say you love me and you keep not my Commandments you lie this is the Word of God you lie and the truth is not in you so it's really easier to hate God than what we realize because when we choose to disobey the Word of God we're hating God this is what the scripture defines as a hatred toward God so don't don't say I love him don't say I love the Lord and and not pursue truth make up your mind that if you indeed love him you're going to push with everything you've got toward living a life that would glorify the Lord I want to say something to you that I say all the time and that is sometimes people will say oh you know when I read the Bible God requires so much I just don't know how I can live under that heavy burden but what you fail to understand my friend is that everything that God requires of us everything that God asks of us he provides he gives us grace to be obedient he shows us mercy when we fail to be obedient he tells us do not sin and yet he say if you sin you have an advocate with the father you know I sometimes say this is rigged I sometimes say God has rigged this it's it's fixed because everything that he asked us to do he provides everything we need to measure up if we will learn to trust him and not ourselves and not our works so in this particular scripture this sin this iniquity is continued to be visited upon the third and the fourth generation of them that hate me and I I would say that it just starts over after the fourth generation in an unbelieving family it just starts over and continues and continues and continues another for generations and other for generations etc but if there is a generation that decides no more no more I'm going to stop this cycle I'm gonna find a way to break this addiction this generational curse this generational cycle or pattern I'm not going to live under the same kind of burden that my father lived under my grandfather it stops here too many times we use these things as excuses it's all I've known it's all I've ever seen it's the only influence I've ever had you can't do that it can't become a crutch it can't become an excuse for bad behavior and making bad choices what you've got to do is come to God come to the Lord lay it before him Oh father I see I see that I am following in my father's footsteps away from you and he followed in his father's footsteps and my children will follow in my footsteps but I see thank God I recognize that I can make the difference with true repentance I can break this cycle you see in reality we're not inheriting the sins of our parents but the defilement that their sins have produced in the family the defilement it's the it's the influence it's that defiling factor that passes down and down and down and down until somebody rises up in true repentance and breaks the cycle a generational curse is passed down from one generation to another generation because of rebellion remember the verse said to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me of them that continue to walk in rebellion against my way and against my word it's very true my friend that the the choices and the unconfessed sins of our fathers and mothers before us can leave us with a predisposition to certain behaviors to certain addictions a particular vulnerability can come upon our lives because of what our parents did before us and they never confessed and perhaps never repented and the cycle was never broken I don't know if the word predisposition is a word that you're familiar with so before I came out here today I I grabbed a definition and it was from from the Webster dictionary predisposition means to have a liability or a tendency or a weakness towards certain things and I hope when you hear that definition at least your mind is going to some examples that you have observed haven't you ever observed a family where the same cycle just repeated itself and repeated itself and you were watching it from afar perhaps it was easier for you to recognize the generational pattern and cycle in another family than what was even going on in your own family we've seen that something like divorce something like broken marriages even can be passed down from generation to generation until someone recognized it and repents for the breaking of the vow and repents for our fathers who broke the vow and we make up our minds we're going to live by God's order and by God's Word and we're going to cover our children and their marriage and our grandchildren and their marriage and so let me go on with this definition it means to have a liability or a tendency or a weakness towards certain things it means to be susceptible to suffer from a particular condition or to hold a particular attitude or to act in a certain way and this is the definition of a predisposition and I want to give you a common example that I use sometime and that is you take a mother who has had some sort of scare around the water maybe a boat capsized or maybe a loved one drowned and this woman has developed this real phobia real fear of not only being in the water but even being near the water and maybe she has all kinds of symptoms you know I've seen people that afraid of the water and their palms would get clammy and they would break out in a sweat and the color would drain from their face I mean this was a legitimate concern legitimate fear of phobia and here's the thing that mother so easily transfers that fear to her child so is a and sometimes the mother makes up her mind you know I'm not going to let my children get near the water I'm not going to let him and so the next thing you know the little children are afraid of the water until finally somebody says wait a minute I don't want much this has been a torment in my life I was never able to go swimming I was never able to have fellowship around the water because I was so afraid of water and maybe that woman might say and so was my mother before me but but wait a minute I don't want to see my my daughter or my son live with a fear that is unfounded because maybe you had a reason to allow that fear to come in maybe you nearly drowned maybe you had a friend in school who drowned maybe you had a as I said fell out of a boat or something but but your child that next generation they perhaps had no reason and and yet you can see that fear finally a mother recognizes wait a minute I'm projecting that fear I'm actually creating a predisposition in my children to be afraid of water and finally that that woman says wait a minute I'm not gonna do that to my children I don't know if I can get rid of this thing for myself I'm sure I'd sure like to beat it but I don't want them to be affected by it so I'm gonna do something about it I'm gonna enroll them in a swimming class I'm gonna do something to ensure that they are not afraid of the water and and that cycle is broken I don't know if that would be considered a generational cycle or or well it sure it has to be I don't know if it would be considered a generational curse but it certainly I think it constricts it boxes in a generation and I think when we really love our children we we want them to to excel to go up and beyond the kind of life that we have had now that predisposition can run in many many different areas of our life again as we mentioned just a little bit earlier it can be addictions can be drugs it can be alcohol it can be pornography it can be so many different things remember we're looking for patterns we're looking for cycles that have passed from generation to generation when we recognize them we're going to repent of our generation being involved and we're going to repent before the Lord for our fathers and grandfathers and when I say this repentance it to me it's a prayer that says you know I don't want this thing to continue my perhaps my parents didn't realize that my grandparents didn't realize it so I just repent on behalf of those who were before me it's not some technical I've got to say it the right way this kind of thing because the scripture actually says later in Ezekiel that when we answer to God we're only responsible for our sins and not the sins of our parents and grandparents so it's not the sin that I'm talking about particularly being carried on from generation to generation it's the weakness it's the liability the tendency the predisposition towards certain things that we want to see cut off the life taken right out of it and it's those demon spirits that I believe Satan assigns to perpetuate to keep alive that cycle so that it keeps passing on I tell you it makes me pretty disturbed I get pretty angry when I see how the enemy likes to wrap up generations of families I'm gonna list some of the ways and we're going to pray a prayer as we go off the air but we'll have to carry this topic forward I'm going to you through a prayer I'm going to show you in the scripture what we can do to absolutely break that cycle once and for all to see that curse removed so that we can go forward and again this is available to us because of the cross because of the work that Jesus accomplished on our behalf I want to list a few things here and just mention that not in every case but in some cases these things will continue to pass on in families as a generational cycle or as a generational curse for instance divorce and when we say divorce we could also say that infidelity adultery unfaithfulness in a marriage that kind of thing can pass on and on and on I want you to know that this was something that was definitely a stronghold in my family in the generations that were before me my great grandfather my grandfather my father unfaithful to their vow to their commitment and this was certainly something that I had to recognize I had to pray about it pray against it because I certainly didn't want that to be a part of my life and I definitely didn't want it to be a part of my children's life but I can see three generations and perhaps more but I'm personally aware of three generations that dealt with with unfaithfulness and the breaking of vows and covenants another another sin another really serious bad behavior that can pass on from generation to generation in a family is incest having inappropriate relationship with family members which which is abuse and which is very very dangerous because it marks it marks children it marks teenagers they carry these ours into their life and if that cycle is not broken by the blood of Jesus and sincere prayer it carries on to the next generation poverty poverty can be a generational curse or cycle you accept the fact that you'll never have anything and you you you you end up at times people end up developing a very lazy lifestyle because they feel their curse they feel like we can never be anything but but in poverty and just hand the mouth and and not be able to break through into a better job or a better career that can be broken you can stop that now another is anger oh my how a bad temper can travel generationally from one generation to the next I mean hot heated violent anger can take a hold in families and it's a pattern that can absolutely be broken and there are many other ungodly patterns that we have recognized through the years some of these are listed here because of my own experience as a pastor watching how the enemy takes advantage of a generation they had nothing to do with the sin of the parents or grandparents Tyl but the enemy takes advantage of another generation and he assigns those demonic spirits to create this sense of vulnerability and my I've watched the devil do things as as complex as making these things available putting it right up in their face having people to offer it to them free of charge and and someone just innocently taking that because it was the the pattern that was set before them not realizing that you are falling into a generational you're falling into a cycle that has come down upon you from another generation and you can be free but there was the enemy setting things up to make it so easy thanks be to God we can be free we can be delivered we can walk out of that cycle that pattern father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I feel handicapped a bit because I want to to finish this but my time is gone and so lord I ask right now that you will speak to hearts and lives and that men and women will will use their mind and think a little and just see if they have noticed these kinds of patterns in their own generations and father help us to know that every curse is dealt with by the shed blood of Jesus Christ and Satan cannot hold us if we choose to be free in Jesus Lord I'm asking you that over the course of this study that that that generations will be changed that lives will be set free hallelujah that this pattern will not be able to continue from one generation to another the abuse the physical domestic abuse husbands abusing their wives etc I pray O God that this pattern can be exposed that the light can be shined on it ha and that you will give freedom and deliverance because Lord Jesus you paid the price with your own blood to set us free we ask these things and decree them done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen well I hope you've learned something perhaps I have created lots of questions in your mind and we will address some of those questions when we meet again god bless you thank you for sticking with us today until next time bye-bye [Music] [Applause]
