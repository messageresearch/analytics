TRANSCRIPT
========================================
The soul is the mind and the will and the emotion. In a healthy believer, the regenerated spirit is feeding life to the soul and to the body. But in a a human where things are out of order and where the soul is getting more food than the spirit man, the the regenerated spirit man feeds only on the word. And so if you are uh feeding on other things, of course we need moderation in everything because whatever you receive through these gates of our body, we it goes right into the soul which is the mind and the will and the emotion. And depending on whether you are stronger in your spirit or your soul, uh it's soul in the middle, mind, will and emotions. Everything that we see and hear and taste and feel, it goes into the flesh and from there filters into the soul. If the soul is being fed more than the spirit is being fed, the soul rules. And we live based on our own mind, our own will, our own emotions, while our spirit man shrinks. But if you're feasting, if you're feeding the inner spirit on the word of God, it's getting stronger and stronger. We often use the analogy of a stickman, which is about the only man I can draw, and a sumo wrestler. Who knows what a sumo wrestler looks like? You see this huge man, bun on his head, like a bone in his hair, big belly. And don't let that big belly fool you because he can he can throw down an opponent, can't he? Uh that little old stick man, he's not even good enough, strong enough to hold up his own hat. He's just one line and two little sticks and for for arms and two little sticks for a leg. I want you to know that some of us are walking around with a soul that looks like a sumo wrestler and a spirit man that looks like a stick man. I'm going to wait on you to say amen. Because we're feeding this sumo wrestler with all the stuff out there. All the stuff. Our mind is overstimulated by stuff. Our will is getting more stubborn because of stuff that we take in. And our emotions are getting more unnatural and uncontrollable because the soul is getting fat. If we can turn that thing around and begin to feed the spirit man, worship music, the word of God, the messages of the prophet, uh going back over a service at church, reading your Bible, hearing the devotion, doing whatever it is to feed the spirit man, then the stick man that's in our spirit, he begins to grow up and he begins to get stronger. And what happens [Music] automatically is the soul gets smaller. Mind, will and emotions get lessened and we start living out of the spirit. I know that I may be taking a long time with this, but I think you should hear it because I don't want to offend you, but I want to tell you that that some of you are are uh quite fat in your emotions. Your mind, your will, your emotions are getting the most nourishment. And the spirit man is shrinking and then you you want prayer because you're struggling. We all struggle, but sometimes our struggle is simply because we're feeding the wrong part of who we are. It's possible to feed the flesh to make that the stronger part of who you are, pampering ourselves. It's all right to take care of ourselves. Uh you should, especially in the areas of deodorant and shampoo and soap, and these are good things to have. hamper your flesh. Please, by all means, I I give you permission. Hamper your flesh in that regard. But don't let your driving focus become propping this old body up. It's going to fail you. It's going to deteriorate. It's part of God's plan. It's shrinking away. Hallelujah. How could you be excited about that? because it has to give way to another body that's already mine. It's already mine. This one has to give way. So, whatever part of the tripartate man you feed the most is the one that's going to rule the roost. And if you're spending your time putting wood on the fire of gossip and contention and criticism, the soul is thriving and the spirit man is crying out for help. Feed that spirit man.
