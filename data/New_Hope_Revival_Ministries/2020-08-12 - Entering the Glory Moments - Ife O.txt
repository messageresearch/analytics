TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if you ignore praise you're stuck we are citizens of this world by natural but we are citizens of another dimension another world another kingdom by spiritual we get all focused on the natural of course we do because here's where our responsibilities get the best of us but i want you to know you and i can be better about our life over here if we get better about our fellowship over there the more fellowship we have with him and interaction with him in that realm by the word by the anointing by worship because i want you to know worship is going to be a key for the rod for us to come into the government of god if you ignore praise you're stuck it's because there's another realm once we get past extravagant praise we come to zion and what ushers forth from zion is in the atmosphere of worship once we are connected to him once we have praised our way into another dimension another realm where anointing starts giving way for glory and i know that most of us are not experiencing glory like we can and i want to experience more of that glory because it's been promised and that glory is not for feeling that glory is to transform us and i want you to know there are minds that will never be changed by the anointing there are paradigms it will never be changed by the anointing but oh as that person would maybe press in a little bit deeper and the anointing that final burst of anointing starts breaking yolks off and the glory starts streaming down into your heart i'm telling you you can usually feel a shift and when that when that changes like that you know you're connected and that's the time to be quiet and let god talk back to your heart boy if you're ever going to read the bible that's the time to read it if you're ever going to hear a sermon that's a great time to put put in a sermon when you know you have pressed past just anointing and feeling and you have gotten to a place where the glory of god is beginning to break open in your heart
