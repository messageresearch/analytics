[0:00] we're in that place where the bride is
[0:03] called to Ministry
[0:11] what is the message the message is
[0:14] Christ himself
[0:17] that's what it is
[0:19] somebody said what is the message it is
[0:22] the unveiling
[0:24] of Christ himself because if Christ is
[0:28] unveiled you see him in all that he is
[0:31] not just lover
[0:33] not just passionate friend
[0:37] but judge of all mankind
[0:39] a lot of people don't want to know a god
[0:41] like that they feel like if we don't try
[0:44] to know a god like that we won't face
[0:45] the Judgment but we but they will
[0:48] they will the message is Christ himself
[0:51] it's the unveiling it's the apocalipsis
[0:53] of Christ the fullness of the word
[0:56] spoken by the mouth of all God's holy
[0:59] prophets since the world began
[1:01] and so the Bible said
[1:03] it's it's all the truth
[1:07] it took the restoration through the
[1:09] church ages to bring us to that point of
[1:14] culmination
[1:15] and that's why we hear Brother Branham
[1:17] saying that seventh angel he has no
[1:21] message of his own
[1:24] he's just tying together all of the
[1:27] Loose Ends
[1:29] loose threads of all the other messages
[1:32] why was that necessary because Luther
[1:35] although he preached justification was
[1:37] still a trinitarian baptizing in titles
[1:40] more Catholic than some Catholics today
[1:43] Wesley though he though he had the
[1:46] sanctification right was still a
[1:48] trinitarian baptizing in the name of
[1:50] titles and at the end of his life
[1:52] allowed them sprinkling
[1:57] so we that wasn't all the truth
[1:59] so we had to have somebody to come and
[2:01] say though these Messengers from Paul
[2:04] all the way through to Wesley
[2:07] they restored great truth
[2:11] there had to be somebody who could come
[2:14] at the end of the age and tie together
[2:18] pulling together pulling out the truth
[2:21] and leaving behind that which was not
[2:24] truth because from Ephesus which was a
[2:27] perfect word
[2:28] it began to go down
[2:30] see and it had to come back up we're in
[2:34] that place where the bride is called to
[2:37] Ministry we're in that place where the
[2:40] bride is called to prophesy we're not
[2:44] depending on the seventh angel to
[2:46] prophesy anymore it's now the bride's
[2:49] time it's now time for the bride to
[2:52] prophesy it's time for the bride to
[2:55] declare the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:57] it's time for the bride to reflect the
[3:00] character of the Lord Jesus Christ it's
[3:03] our time now that's what the message
[3:05] said that's what the word has said
[3:09] we've got a problem and we either want
[3:12] to put everything in the past
[3:14] or we want to put everything way out
[3:16] there in the future
[3:17] so we can live how we want to live now
[3:20] but now is the important time now is the
[3:24] appointed time
