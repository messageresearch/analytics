[0:03] you can't just have faith that the
[0:06] promises of God are yes a man for
[0:09] someone else if you do then unbelief
[0:13] will keep you from entering into the
[0:15] fullness of what Christ has made
[0:18] available for you and I in this hour to
[0:22] be partakers of him means that we
[0:27] receive the benefit of being a part of
[0:31] him of being connected to him
[0:34] participating with him in the plan of
[0:37] redemption and the enemy doesn't want
[0:39] that he doesn't want that he wants you
[0:42] and I wavering in unbelief the the enemy
[0:46] is actually less challenged by your
[0:48] faith for someone else he is more
[0:52] challenged by what faith you have for
[0:56] your own life to believe that these
[0:59] promises of God are for you
[1:02] I'm going to mix join my faith with
[1:08] God's Word and I'm going to hold on it
[1:11] kills unbelief your faith attached to
[1:15] God's Word
[1:16] kills unbelief it drives it right out of
[1:20] your life and why is getting rid of
[1:23] unbelief so important because unbelief
[1:26] can keep you out of rest when I'm
[1:29] talking about spiritual rest
[1:31] I mean confidence and trust that I'm
[1:36] covered by the blood he loves me he has
[1:41] chosen me he wants to be a part of my
[1:45] life in fact he wants to be my life he
[1:48] wants to be the center of my life and
[1:51] why wouldn't I want him to be because
[1:53] the more I allow him to be lord over my
[1:57] life
[1:58] I'm telling you the grater against the
[2:02] greater the relationship grows if you
[2:05] and I are willing to put our faith into
[2:07] action joining it with the Word of God
[2:09] then the full effectiveness of the word
[2:13] becomes our inheritance everything God
[2:16] promised to do he will do for us
[2:20] the Lord is inviting us to have
[2:22] something more than just Christianity
[2:25] light he wants us to understand what it
[2:29] means to be filled with the very life of
[2:32] God and to enter into that place of rest
[2:36] where the works the good works that we
[2:40] do we do them out of love we do them
[2:44] because we want to serve him not because
[2:47] we want to earn his favor
