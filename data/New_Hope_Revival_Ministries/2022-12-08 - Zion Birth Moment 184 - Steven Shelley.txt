Description:
In vision the Lord showed Mount Zion in birth pains.  When the Bride is being repositioned spiritually from one season into another, it can be messy, contracting as with a woman giving birth.  

Zion is a people, and Zion people must have a Zion birth; the sons of God must be birthed from one virtue into the other.  We attain those virtues by birthing, by climbing into the ‘Stature of the Perfect Man’, Jesus!

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the sons of God are birth out of Zion so Zion is more than a place Zion is a people and Zion people they come about by a Zion birth there is a repositioning that has to take place when we recognize that God is squeezing us you know I like to stroll from season to season I like to walk out of my trials but I right into my blessings but how many of you know you don't always change dimensions and seasons threatened sometimes it's my contractions okay you know I saw once envisioned Mount Zion in birth pains Contracting like a woman giving birth because it is out of oh because it is out of Zion that sons are born the sons of God are birthed out of Zion so Zion is more than a place Zion is a people and Zion people they come about by Zion birth and sometimes the squeeze is how we get from one season to the next and there's nothing dignified it's messy and you're not gonna always stroll from one spiritual season to the next sometimes you're going to be squeezed out and sometimes you're going to walk into your new season with a cone-shaped head because things get a little tight in there how many of you have ever had a season where you it was getting a little tied in the air somebody said 2020 was like that and then 2021 came and they said 2021 that was it that was the year from you nowhere and then 2022 came and they're saying the same thing and the truth is none of them were hideous or horrible or from hell they were all from heaven they just did not smell the same they don't all look the same because in God their Ebbs and flows in seasons and cycles and come on all of this for a purpose because there are virtues that's more than Thunders by the way virtues that we are climbing and the and the word of the Lord came and said you're gonna get it by births you're gonna get them by birth you're not going to get them by them dropping down on your head you're going to get them by being birthed from one virtue into another virtue into another virtue as you begin to climb the stature up into climb up into the stature of the perfect man it's the perfect man it's his stature that we're climbing into and the perfect man was John 1 in the beginning was the word the word became flesh and the Word was God
