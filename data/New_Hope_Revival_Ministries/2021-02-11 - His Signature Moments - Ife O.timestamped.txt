[0:00] because he wants you to be his signature
[0:03] in the earth
[0:12] in that day saith the lord of hosts will
[0:15] i
[0:15] take thee zerubbabel my servant and i
[0:18] will make thee
[0:19] as a signet for i have
[0:23] chosen thee he is saying to the governor
[0:28] you are not just going to be a person
[0:31] in an out of the way place that ha is
[0:34] hassled by uh naysayers
[0:38] along the way that want to keep you from
[0:41] doing what you have been called to do
[0:43] but i am not going to just put a signet
[0:46] on your hand
[0:48] i've heard the term signet ring and i
[0:51] know that it was a man's mark
[0:55] but it made more sense to me when i read
[0:58] it's a signature ring
[1:03] and when a man had on his signet ring
[1:06] and he put his seal or his signature on
[1:10] a document
[1:11] of business it was a signature of
[1:14] authority so now we have a governor
[1:18] he doesn't say i'm going to give you a
[1:21] signet ring
[1:22] he says i am going to make you
[1:25] a signet for i have chosen these saith
[1:29] the lord
[1:30] now zerubbabel was a man who passed off
[1:34] of the scene
[1:35] but i am going to take this little bit
[1:38] of scripture right here
[1:40] and i don't want to be a con taking a
[1:42] text out of context
[1:44] but i would say that the holy spirit has
[1:47] said enough to us
[1:48] through the years that when he puts the
[1:51] baptism of the holy ghost in you
[1:54] that you are not just carrying a ring
[1:57] with a signature
[1:59] but you become the signature
[2:02] and your name on the check is as good as
[2:06] his
[2:08] right so now zerubbabel
[2:11] is becoming the signet he says in that
[2:14] day
[2:15] and we know that this is speaking of a
[2:17] future time
[2:18] the messiah i understand that but we can
[2:21] bring it all the way up to our day
[2:24] again by the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:27] in the believer walking talking holy
[2:30] spirit
[2:31] in this earth he's making you
[2:34] a signature in the earth
[2:38] you're not just a human being walking
[2:40] around on earth taking up space
[2:43] living here for a certain number of
[2:45] years and then you die and it's over
[2:47] with
[2:47] you have been given the holy ghost
[2:51] the seal of god you have been given for
[2:54] a reason
[2:55] because he wants you to be his signature
[2:58] in the earth
[3:04] you
