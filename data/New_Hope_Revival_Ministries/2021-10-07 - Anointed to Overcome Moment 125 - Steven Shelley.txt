Description:
"No greater example of overcoming every temptation and dart the enemy hurls against us has been given to us than Jesus Christ, who worshiped the Word and overcame ‘ALL’ by the Word.  We too worship the Word when we apply, speak, believe, obey and surrender to the Word to come forth in the ‘overcomers’ anointing."

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and that word is constantly working in you as you surrender to it to make you come forth in the overcomers anointing and we take the truth of wesley and we take the truth of pentecost and we let it sit in the light that has been prophesied for this day and then we apply it to our life and when we do that it releases an anointing to overcome anything that the enemy would launch against you i am anointed to overcome anything not because i'm anything but because the one who anoints me see this is the hour where the yoke is destroyed this is the hour where god brings forth the people and he fills them with the fatness of his anointing yes it's the oil of his glory the yoke that once enslaved her can no longer contain her because of the blessing and the anointing and the oil of the lord the fatness of the lord that's being poured out on her how are you going to overcome by the word and by the word only can you remember that when you're in the heat of the battle when you're in the thick of the fight can you remember that can somebody help me remember can i help you remember can we help each other remember that even our lord was tempted this way and he overcame every temptation every personal temptation of satan by the word his ability to overcome in all things was directly attached to the fact that he constantly constantly constantly consistently applied the word he applied the word he applied the word in his own personal life contending with himself how's that possible because his flesh pulled in one direction and his spirit life pulled in another direction no wonder he said oh the flesh is weak my spirit is willing but my flesh is weak i know what is ahead of me but but oh if it be possible let this cup pass from me he was contending with himself there's never been a greater example of how god and man were in direct conflict with one another while living in the same body we can understand what paul was going through because we understand what jesus was going through we can understand what each other is facing because we understand what jesus was going through worship the word don't you get your bible in your mind [Music] the word [Music] in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god i worship the word powerful powerful powerful we apply the word we speak the word we believe the word we obey the word we surrender to the word and that word is constantly working in you as you surrender to it to make you come forth in the overcomers anointing you are anointed to overcome anything and everything the enemy would launch against you in this hour but it is not by your success your success is by depending on his success
