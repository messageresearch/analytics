Description:
#NewHopeRevivalMinistries

We, as the Bride, must be perfected by the revealed Word of God. We must know what "the mystery" of God is so that we can see Him clearly - not through the lattice as the church. The Bride will see Him completely unveiled, nothing held back, so that she not only becomes a reflection of who He is, but a portion of who He is.
