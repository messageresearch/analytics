TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to thank you for tuning in to the broadcast today we're looking forward to sharing with you the good news of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ I've been particularly blessed lately by your emails we get a few letters and even a few phone calls but mostly correspondence through email and you have been sharing with us how that this program has been a blessing in your life and we recognize that because of the miracle of satellite television the Lord is allowing us to reach you in your part of the world perhaps in places that we may never be able to go physically just simply because of time restraints but it is a wonderful joy every time an email comes in from someone and they say we watch you on the gospel Channel we watch you on Angel TV sometimes people say we watch you on the Internet we see these programs on by streaming them on the networks on the internet or even by podcast so however you see these programs it is a real joy and I say that from the bottom of my heart to be able to come to you in this manner and we know it's a gift from God and we want to use it we want to be good stewards of the gift that the Lord has given us so we invite you if you haven't already contacted our ministry the contact information is given to you at the bottom of the screen and it would be a great delight to hear from you also share with us your prayer request we believe that where two or more agree is touching on any one thing the Lord has promised that he would grant it and so we we really enjoy the privilege of being able to join with you in faith for your prayer requests the most exciting part of praying with you concerning your prayer requests is when another email comes in with a testimony to tell us that God has answered prayer we've had testimonies of people healed from cancer we've had testimonies of children who were born very handicapped and very afflicted and God intervened and one child particularly was an unable to walk and after prayer the Lord raised up the child to be able to walk and baffle the doctors and so I tell you when we know that we have had some small part in agreeing with you in faith and then God gives the increase then it's a it's a wonderful encouragement to me to our family and to all of those who pray with us here in Alabama for your request I want to look we're starting a new series today we're going to be talking about the spiritual process of adoption and adoption spiritual adoption has been misunderstood down through the church ages and we're going to talk about it for the next few weeks we're going to look at the scriptures we're going to examine some of the Greek words and I trust and pray that God will use this series to quicken your heart and to awaken you to your destiny as an adopted son of God so we want to look to the Word of God right now if you'll go with me to Romans chapter 8 we're going to begin reading in verse 14 Romans chapter 8 and verse 14 for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption see that is one of the very first places in the Bible where we get that word thus the phrase the spirit of adoption indicating that we're not talking about a natural process of adoption through the legal court system where a family might adopt a child from another family whose parents were unable to take care of that child but we're talking about a spiritual process of adoption we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption I even like the way it sounds whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself we're talking about his spirit beareth witness with our spirit his spirit is bearing witness coming into agreement with our spirit that we are the children of God now what this verse is saying to us is it is only by revelation spirit to spirit fellowship with God a revelation where a vital truth that we have heard that we have read that somehow has entered into our mind into our thinking process now by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit we say it drops from our head to our heart it becomes more it was an idea it was a thought it was perhaps a belief but when the Spirit of God anoints that truth and it drops down into our heart and deeper than that into our spirit man it becomes a revelation and it's only by revelation that we can know that we are truly the sons of God now remember that this is a genderless spiritual process it has nothing to do with male or female so if you're a precious sister and you're watching this program and you say he's not even preaching about me because I'm a woman and he never says daughter of God he always says a son of God but we understand that these spiritual truths are genderless they're not based on male or female they're their spiritual and in this aspect the Bible tells us there is neither male nor female with God now it's also interesting to understand that God is speaking to his people all over the world about the bridal pair dime or the revelation of being the bride of Jesus Christ and this is also a genderless revelation so if I as a male can be the Bride of Christ then you my precious sister can be a son of God it's a genderless revelation but remember we don't come to that place of being a son of God because we join a church or because we shape the pastor's hand or because our name is put on the rulebook of a particular denomination or a religious system this is a spiritual birth we are born again of the Spirit of God we are then sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and then we receive the precious infilling or the baptism of the Holy Spirit and fire and this completes the new birth process once we receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit we we can say that we have come to this full place of being born again but there's more once we can say I have now in reality and in fulfillment been born again of the Spirit of God that's not the end that's the end of one process but it's the beginning of something much greater than that being born again of the Spirit of God is the beginning of your spiritual process of becoming an adopted son of God or we'll read in this study later in one of the portions of Scripture in the New Testament where it talks about the manifestation the unveiling the revealing of the sons of God and that's where we are coming to swiftly in this hour a time where God Almighty is going to unveil he's going to take the cover off and he's going to show planet Earth what he's been working on for six thousand years he's been working on a bribed one who a company when we say one we don't mean one individual we mean one company one group of people a holy remnant that God will manifest himself through in great and mighty ways here in the end time now I was going to just read these verses and then break them down at the end but since we talked about verse 16 the spirit itself various beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God then I want to go back to verse 15 for ye received the spirit of bondage again to fear now there are multiple layers of truth in verse 15 we can talk about lots of different subjects one thing that we could look at is fear the Bible tells us that fear brings torment and I'm finding out that the enemy is doing everything he can in this hour to bind God's people with fear but we must overcome fear and the Bible tells us how fear is overcome you remember what the scripture said the Bible tells us that perfect love the perfect love of God that has been shed abroad in our hearts through the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua the Messiah because of that perfect love fear is cast out perfect love casteth out fear it is not God's will for you to be paralyzed by fear the fear of the unknown the fear of stepping out in faith to obey the Word of God are to obey the leadership of the Holy Spirit it is not God's will for you to be afraid of coming into the place of your destiny where where you are beginning to fulfill what God has called you to do there are hidden gifts and talents that are a part of your Destinee that are a part of who you are that are lying in you right now in seed form that must be anointed by the power of the Spirit of God and quickened and made alive so that they will begin to manifest and that causes many people to be afraid because as one brother said to me one time I know that if I yield myself to the Spirit of God I will lose control and really I thought that was a outstanding thing that the brother would be able to admit his fear of losing control but many of us have that fear we're afraid that if we yield our lives to the Spirit of God that we no longer called the shots that he begins to make our decisions for us and I want to tell you as something not an expert but as someone who has learned that walk of surrendering my will and losing control it's the greatest life there is there's no life greater on planet earth or I want to say above the earth or under the earth as well that there's no life that could compare to knowing that you are led every moment by the power of the Holy Spirit and if you lose your way or the instruction from the Lord is a little bit unclear then you just go back to him in prayer and you say Lord I've lost my way I can't seem to hear from you I'm not sure what you would have me to do and so I'm going to do nothing I'm going to stand still until you reveal to me the next step and God who is faithful he wants to reveal that to us now what we've just been describing is a big portion of what we would call the Spirit walk and God is calling us to step out of the walk of carnality the flesh walk and he's even calling us to a place where we are no longer allowing our soul or even our heart to lead us but where we are allowing the Spirit that God has given us our human spirit that has been regenerated by his Spirit that spirit to spirit contact or spirit to spirit fellowship the transformation of our spirit because of his spirit coming to live inside and that's how we want to be led from his spirit that has given new life to our spirit so really there is a place in Christ where his spirit and our spirit are merged and we call this the union experience we are thinking about the Apostle Paul when he was talking about some of the heavenly experiences that he had had and he said I knew a man in Christ and you know many of you are familiar with that he was caught up into the third heaven and so forth God showed him some unbelievable revelations and some of which could not even be uttered because of the magnitude and and then he also tells us that he was there was a messenger of Satan that was assigned to him to buffett him lest he be exalted above measure because of the magnitude of the revelation that God was giving him but when we read that in the King James it says I knew a man in Christ and I think that's lovely but I don't think we get the fullness of what that means I knew a man in Christ sometimes when we read that we think well I he's saying I knew a man that went church or I knew a man that went to Mass or I knew a man that fasted on Friday but it's so much more than that and I like dr. Stern's translation of the Bible the complete Jewish Bible and in his translation of that verse of scripture he said I knew a man in union with Messiah and I want to tell you something that's not just for the Apostle Paul's of planet Earth that's not just for the Enoch enix or the Elijah's or the Moses that is a promise that is available to you and I it is possible for men and women in this hour to come into that place of being in union with Messiah it is about relationship we're finding out in this hour this is the most unusual hour season of my Christian journey I've been preaching the gospel since 1975 so I'll be celebrating this year 34 years of following the Lord Jesus and having the baptism of the holy spirit and preaching the gospel I entered into active full-time public ministry at the age of seven and started pastoring a Pentecostal church at the age of 17 so ministry is all I've ever known but this right now is the most unusual season that I've ever known in the Lord because his emphasis is a so loud he is emphasizing this one thing so loud in my spirit and many of those men and women around the world who have prophetic insight are getting the same message the same theme the same emphasis and that is it's all about relationship with him and you know this makes some of us very uncomfortable because we have learned to approach God by the vehicle of religion and there is safety in religion people feel safe in religion because they know what religion dictates and what it expects it doesn't matter what flavor of religion you have you know if you've been brought up in a particular religious faith you know what the expectations are and so over a period of time you begin to think if I meet those expectations then I have a relation ship with God if I follow the expectations or the rules of my church then I am automatically magically in relationship with God and this is where religion has its place it certainly has its place but religion is not enough because religion can become tradition and it can become legalism it can bring us to the place where we feel like the only way that we can approach God is to live more religiously and when I say religious I don't mean a life of dedication or a life of real consecration I mean a life where we think by going to church two or three times a week or in some faiths two or three times a day you know perhaps praying with beads or are going through some liturgy and I don't want to leave out the Pentecostal church because we have a lot of Pentecostal liturgy we have a lot of ideas about what church is supposed to be and what it's not supposed to be but when we start depending on those things to bring us closer to God then we're using religion in a wrong way and and the end of that road will never be relationship and so I think what we must do in this hour is to find relationship first and God will lead us by relationship to where we need to be in him and I trust the the convicting power of the Spirit of God to speak to you as individuals if you're in relationship if you're in union with Messiah he will teach you the Bible said so when he the Spirit of Truth has come he will lead you and guide you into all righteousness it is the will of God that you walk sanctified and separated and set apart from the things of this world but but religion cannot produce relationship so if we if we allow the Spirit of God to draw us into relationship first then by our relationship with him he will then reveal to us the things that we should do the things that we should not do the the the measure of dedication that he would want us to have how long he would have us to fast and and how we need to be faithful to meet with one another in in faith and talk about the good things of the Lord perhaps how we should be modest because God wants his people to to conduct themselves and in a modest way in a holy way so that wherever we are and whatever we're doing people are able to immediately identify us as children of God but what has happened in the church world is we have brought people to religion which leaves us feeling very detached from God and then when we make us a mistake and when we fail we feel like all of heaven is angry and that God is sitting on his throne with a white wig and a sledgehammer and he's ready to crack our heads with his sledgehammer and nothing could be any further away from the truth the truth is your heavenly Father loves you and he's not going to compromise with your sin he's not going to pat you on the back when you walk in unrighteousness but his desire when you fail when you sin when you make a mistake his desire is to call you to draw you back into relationship with him so his way of correcting you his preferred way of correcting you is by grace and in love calling you back into fellowship with him now if you're as hard-headed as I've been sometimes over the years it takes more than a gentle wooing of come back and get on the right track sometimes God does have to deal with us a little more harshly but the scripture tells us this is also a part of God's Way it's also a part of relationship the Bible tells us that those who God loves he chastens he corrects he brings correction to and if he does not correct us then we're illegitimate we are none of his and I believe that many of you are desiring a place of relationship and you love your church and you love what you've been brought up in and you love the fellowship that you get but you're finding out that that is not enough you can follow all the traditions you can follow all the rules you can be faithful to church you can pay your tithe and still not be satisfied with your spiritual life so let us work on relationship first and thank God relationship is a two-way street it's it's it's hearing from God and it's also God hearing from you he wants you to be able to pour your heart out to him and you know some people are so afraid of offending the Lord if they tell God how they really feel I have a newsflash for you he already knows how you feel so when you tell him how you feel you're not going to offend him he already knows and it is so healing it's so strengthening to be able to go to the Lord sometime and say I don't understand what's happening around me I don't understand what's happening in my life right now and I'm not here to complain I'm here to ask for your help and for your strength I want your deliverance I want your healing power I want your word to work in my life as you have promised that it will and it will so God doesn't want us bound by fear he doesn't want us bound by religion he doesn't want us bound by shame he war he wants us to be bound to him in love in perfect love you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you've received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father now I get to tell my favorite story about this phrase ABBA it's the Hebrew word of affection for father and this is what God is calling us to and I'm gonna say this again and then I'm gonna get off religion but most people with a religious mindset have a very hard time embracing the concept that your father wants you to come into a place your heavenly father the father of all the creator of the universe wants you he's after you his heart is toward you and he wants to show you his love and he wants to pull you into a place of intimate fellowship and relationship with him and because of religion most of us have a very hard time embracing that idea that God really cares that much about us as individuals but I want to tell you friend he does and he would move heaven and earth to come after you that is his love and that is His grace when we're in Jerusalem sometimes we like to go to the market to the shook and sometimes we go on air Shabbat which is the day before Shabbat begins that evening and people are busy very very busy buying their food their produce and everything that is going to be a part of their Sabbath meal and even beautiful flowers to adorn the table and oftentimes I will see father's with their small children most of the time you will see mothers and their small children but oftentimes on this day mother is at home she's cleaning the house she's preparing the food she's getting ready to usher in the Shabbat and father bravely has taken the children to buy the last-minute things that have been forgotten now in the press of the crowd in the in the shouting of the then nurse a little child can get lost from his father very easily and it has been more than once that I've heard the cry of a little child saying abba-abba-abba and every father in the vicinity every father in in distance in the right distance to be able to hear the child will stop what they're doing to see if this is their child that is calling out Papa Abba daddy and you know I have children and my time is gone and I'm gonna have to let you go and talk to you about this another time father I just ask that you would take this truth and make it real in the heart of every viewer in the name of Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen bye-bye thank you for watching the Eagles cry tune in again [Music] you
