TRANSCRIPT
========================================
for there's going to be another fleshed out manifestation of the same spirit life Jesus goes on multiple times in the Gospels to explain I and my father are are one when you have seen me you have seen the father we know that they were one and the same in spirit we know they were one in the same in essence but they had different purpose and they're different purpose determined their office but they were the same in spirit and there was only one and when you saw the son you were looking at the purpose of the father because the purpose of the father was revealed in the son and the purpose of the son was revealed by the son and one of these days you're going to stand before the Father's throne and you're going to be shocked there's going to be people yet still surprised to see Jesus sitting on his Father's throne maybe someone will yet ask but I thought that was the Father's throne and it is and yet you see Jesus sitting on his Father's throne why is that because the mystery of God was made manifest by Jesus Christ Jesus is the mystery he is the fulfillment of the mystery the fleshing out of the father the Ministry of Jesus the office of the Sun is the fleshing out of the purpose of the Father and so when he moved in the earth in a physical body it seemed as though he was separated from his father because he was being manifest in a body of flesh and yet he wanted us to understand today that everything he did he moved from the inside and everything he did he did in divine synchronization with his father the father was moving and as the father was moving in him he moved in the physical there was an eternal spirit of the Father inside that logos word was inside that which ushered out from the great fountain of life was inside him and when it moved the physical body that contained that deity that physical body moved for there's going to be another fleshed out manifestation of the same spirit life not one man but in the body of people not chosen by their track record here on earth not chosen because they were good from the time they were born till now but chosen at the good pleasure of the Father hallelujah according to the purposes of his will because it pleased him to choose you
