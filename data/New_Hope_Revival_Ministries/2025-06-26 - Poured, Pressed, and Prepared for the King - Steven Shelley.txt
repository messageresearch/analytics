Description:
You didn’t choose yourself—He chose you. Like the grape that’s poured from vessel to vessel, God is refining you for something greater. But comfort can contaminate the wine. If we settle, we lose the fragrance of Christ. This message invites you into the deeper process—where the pressing brings the purest worship, and the wine is reserved for the King’s chalice. Don’t stay stuck. Cry out. Be poured again. Let Him finish what He started. The goal is intimacy, not religion. Authority, not just identity. Step behind the veil… and come out carrying His name.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
The the grape doesn't choose itself. It doesn't jump off the vine into the basket and say, "I'm going to be wine." Aren't you glad that's what you've got to remember? I wouldn't have chose me. You wouldn't have chose you in your lowest point in your lowest point. When you see yourself, you'd say, "I would have never chose." Aren't you glad that you didn't do the choosing? In ancient wine- making, the process of refining wine involved carefully pouring from one vessel to another, leaving behind the dregs. When we refuse to be poured from vessel to vessel, when we get comfortable, when we settle in comfort or pride or pain, we take on the aroma of the flesh instead of the fragrance of Christ. The journey starts like this, from vine to vessel. From vessel to vessel, from a final racking vessel to another more honorable vessel. There is an end. There is an end. And that is the more honorable vessel, the chalice of our bridegroom king. But what you have got to do is make sure that you don't get comfortable in the vessel that you're in now. that you don't cry out for more of him. Because if the deep is calling to the deep, guess what that means? It means that there's a deep over there that that is waiting to respond to the call that's in here. If you quit letting the deep cry out to the deep, you'll stay in your in your vessel and you'll and your wine will become bitter and contaminated. So you start crying out to the master. I want to be the wine in your chalice. I I want to be, oh God, like perfume poured on your feet. I I want my eyes to run down with tears so that I can worship you the way that I desire to worship you. The taste of our life when we give ourselves to the king, don't you want him to say, "That's the best my my my that's the best wine I've ever tasted." Don't you want him to uh swirl the bouquet and and say that praise that worship you're giving me is not it's not will worship. It's not it's not conformed praise. It's not following the crowd praise. It's not taking on the spirit of your pastor praise. It's coming from your heart and it and it tastes delicious and it smells amazing. That's the kind of wine we want to become. I cannot afford to settle now. I've got to go all the way. I've got to go all the way until there's no more religion hanging on us. But it's relationship. He's literally crying to his bride in this hour. Let me do it. Amen. Get your hands off, your mind off, your mouth, off the situation, and surrender your will. You don't have to figure it out. You don't have to solve the problem. You just have to get out of the way. Just get out of the way and let him show you how much he loves you. Let him show you that now is the time to seek him because now is the time that he is seeking you. He's no longer seeking you to win you or to draw you to salvation. He's now seeking you for fellowship, for intimacy. It's only in that intimacy that that personal relationship with Jesus Christ behind the veil, the veil drops. He said the world is shut out and you are shut in. You and him, you're in a tent. That's where your your nuptual is sealed symbolically. That's where the tokens of virginity are produced symbolically. Amen. In that place, you can't leave that place the same. You may step in as bride. You leave as wife. Wife carries a different kind of authority than an espouseed bride. The wife can sign her name. Ms. Jesus Christ. And it has the same authority that the bridegroom's name has. It is his name, but it's yours because you're the you're the you're the other part of that.
