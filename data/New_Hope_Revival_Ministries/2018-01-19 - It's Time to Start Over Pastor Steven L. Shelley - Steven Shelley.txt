TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit [Music] but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the water that's what makes the big difference is the great mystery right at Christ in you the hope of north [Music] hello this is Pastor Steven Shelley from new hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama I consider it an incredible honor to be able to partner with brother Eric Erickson and the gospel channel what a wonderful work of the Lord they're doing in this time reaching out all across the United Kingdom across Scandinavia across Iceland and into many other areas of the world and thanks be to God it's a ministry that's not only being maintained but it's a ministry that's growing and I just feel so blessed to be able to partner with them and to produce programs here in her little studio that the Lord has blessed us with to help them when there are times if they need a program it's so wonderful I mean I'd rather be in Iceland sometimes sitting down with them I've had incredible times around the table with brother Erickson brother good Munder and so many of the precious brothers that you're used to seeing there on the gospel Channel but it's not always possible to fly to Iceland every time I have something on my heart so the Lord has certainly done a great work for us and giving us this studio my heart like the like the heart and the vision of the gospel channel of course is to reach souls to reach the unreached those who have never trusted Jesus as their Lord and Savior but I have another burden in my heart and that is to encourage the believers those who already believe those of you who have already invited the Lord Jesus into your life and you've been walking with him some of you for many many years now and others you're just beginning your journey and I know how easy it is in the day that we live in - to grow discouraged it's not that we're ever dissatisfied with the Lord he is faithful he is true he dependable he is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother but sometimes just the pressures of life the circumstances family pressure job pressure paying bill pressure it can get the best of us sometimes even sometimes when maybe there's a little bit of strife in the church or we're just not seeing the things that we've been believing for and hoping for we get a little of that Hope deferred and we need to be encouraged that's one of the reasons why I'm so excited about this opportunity to be able to come to you to help them out and also you see our other programs here on the gospel channel including the ego scribe but this is an opportunity to speak to you to encourage you to lift you up I want to thank you for your phone calls your emails both with prayer requests and also those god bless yous just to say we saw the program and we were incredibly blessed we're seeing God move to answer prayer and we're so thankful for that and so we just want to invite you to call to email to send in your prayer request because we take it seriously we believe in the power of prayer and I want to say happy New Year to you we are now in a brand spanking new year I hope you understand that southern lingo we're in a brand new year we've never lived in 2018 we've never served the Lord in 2018 until now 2017 is behind us it's history there may be things in the last year that you and I would like to go back and change or do differently perhaps we'd like to live a more dedicated life or maybe you made mistakes maybe there were failures maybe you had some losses in 2017 and you would like to go back and set that ride and straighten it out but I want you to know that many times it's not possible we do everything that we can to right our wrongs to get up when we fall to dust ourselves off and get back on the trail and and press forward and we'd like to go back can undo and and redo but sometimes it's possible and other times it's just simply not possible but we serve a great big gracious loving God and he sees our heart and you know before we ever walk in the test he already knows he knows how we're going to succeed and how we're going to fail how we're going to press on and maybe sometimes stumble he sees it the test of the Lord and the trials that the Lord allows us to go through they are never so that the Lord can see what we will do sometimes we hear people describing the pressures and trials of life and they'll say it that way they'll say you know the Lord tests us so that he can see our heart so that he can prove our heart and what's going on in their lives but I want you to know that's not exactly how I see the scripture I believe that before I ever walked through the valley before I ever go through the fire before I ever begin the trial the Lord our God who is sovereign who knows all things he knows exactly how I'm going to behave he knows how I'm going to prove and show my strengths and he knows about my weaknesses that may creep up into the situation as well so he doesn't test me or allow me to have trials so that he can figure out who I am he often does it so that I can see my own heart sometimes we feel like that we have dealt with all the pride issues or we have dealt with all the jealousy issues or or whatever your personal issues have been on your journey we just feel like we've overcome it we've moved on and then we walk through another trial and some of the stuff that we felt like we'd placed under the blood perhaps even receive some deliverance from it creeps up again so your tests your trials your valleys are so that you can see your heart so that you can see your reaction so that you can deal again with the things that need to be dealt with and so that you can give everything that you can't change to the Lord who is sovereign who is gracious and who can not only change circumstances he can redeem our losses he can redeem our mistakes he can strengthen and help us in our shortcomings it's so wonderful to see the grace of God in our lives in areas where we have been so weak and we invite God to come in and help us and he does and instead of the weakness that's been there we actually see the Lord's strength we see his hand you know the hand of the Lord is ever upon the believer we may not always see his hand we may not always even feel his hand but it's there he never leaves us alone we are never alone we are not a people forsaken we are a people well loved and well cared for if we've surrendered our lives to the Lord but it's like the poem footprints in the sand sometimes when we go back over our lives ups and downs we only see one set of footprints in the sand it's so quick to say where were you Lord you left me you deserted me there I was struggling all alone but he has another explanation for the fact that there are only one set of footprints in the sand in fact what he says to us is those aren't your footprints those are mine it was in those darkest moments it was in those deepest trials that I was carrying you hey you were on my back he had the hardest part of the partnership he was literally carrying us through the trial and I don't know about you but as I'm speaking to you today my mind is running and I'm thinking very quickly about many many times when I know that I only got through the valley or I only crossed ahead or moved into something new and different because the Lord was carrying me it was certainly not my own strength it certainly wasn't my good looks it certainly wasn't my talents or gifts it was all by the grace of God so I just want to say happy New Year to you I want to I want to remind you that it's 12 months ahead depending on when you see this program that we can determine to give God everything that he has desired from us for so long and that begins in the heart that doesn't begin in our behavior or in our discipline to do good that begins in her heart that's what he's after he wants a place where he can come and live and dwell inside of us and have complete control that's the spirit walk that's the spirit life it may not be the easiest life but it's the most amazing so I encourage you no matter what 2017 was like hey not even the first few days of 2018 maybe things have not been going well for you already in the new year and you're already determining that this year is gonna be a bust because things didn't go so well in the first few days well I want you to know a lot of that would depend on you I'm not just talking about the power of positive thinking I'm talking about walking through the pages of God's Word I'm talking about daily renewing our mind in him disagreeing with Satan's lies about who we are and coming into full into complete agreement with what God's Word has said about us I want to share some portions of Scripture with you today and I want you to when this program is finished and and you move on to the next program I want you to have realized that there is much promise and much hope for your life if you'll just surrender to him I want you to move away from this program thinking about the fact that you've got virgin territory to walk through you've got new experiences you'll have new circumstances this year things will change some things will stay the same God's grace and love for you will certainly be the same but you have a new opportunity a fresh opportunity to give God more of who you are and be used for his glory so turn your faith loose it's time to put our life where our testimony has always been we often say I want God to have my life I want to be completely yielded to him but we very carefully hold on to certain areas of our life that we're really not ready yet to walk with the Lord through those particular places in her heart I've come to a place now where I can't afford any longer to keep anything from him I want him to have it all I don't know if you know this or not but on the Hebrew calendar this is 57 78 on the Gregorian calendar its 2018 both the Hebrew year and the Gregorian year end in the number 8 which is the number of new beginnings I'm going to believe the Lord for a new beginning in your life if your health has been failing I'm going to believe him for a new beginning in the area of your health if your loved ones seem to be getting farther and farther away from God then I'm going to believe God with you that this will be the year of the beginning of their turnaround that God will woo them in such a way and call them in such a way that they will know that it's God that it's not just you and I hounding them because we love them and we want them to do right and serve the Lord I want them to know that God loves them that he's reaching for them I want them to know that this is not as much about joining church as it is about living every day with Jesus and I can tell you that the words to the old song are very very true every day with Jesus is sweeter than the day before I want to share some scriptures with you today and they're serious scriptures because again I I I believe the Lord is speaking to us about really letting our life line up with what we have testified let me just read you a paragraph I wasn't gonna read this but but let me just read you a paragraph that I wrote to share with my own local congregation and this was in our in what we call a watch night service as the old year is ending and the new year is beginning this is what the Lord inspired me to write we must choose now the life that we will live this year if we choose to live our natural lives it will be full of oppression and hopelessness but if we choose for the right reasons to live his life it will be the blessed life the supernatural life the Ascended life and I believe that with all my heart I believe that is the Lord's desire for his people in 2018 and that is that we choose to live his life when you invited the Lord Jesus Christ to come in by his Spirit and live in your heart to wash you with his blood to cleanse you to wash you by the water of his word sanctifying you and setting you apart for service many of you have experienced the baptism of the Holy Ghost which takes your walk with God up another level when we give Him surrender of our lives we now have the potential for his life to come and live through us but that means it's no longer my opinion it's no longer only my desire my dream my vision my goals it now has to become about his life his will his desire for me so I want to ask you to choose today as you're watching this program as you hear my words choose what life will you live in 2018 will you live the flesh life will you live the soul life which is from the realm of the mind and the will and the emotions or will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit where he sits on the control tower of your heart ready to lead ready to direct if you're ready to listen and I'm ready to listen I don't always get the listening part down pat but I'm working toward hearing his will before I do hearing his desire before I say this is something you can pray with me about and I'm going to pray with you that God will give you the same grace that I've been asking for in my life the one thing we need to be this year is authentic we need to be genuine we need to be everything that God has created us to be there's one thing that doesn't work really well in the end time that time we're living in right now and that's hypocrisy to say one thing and willfully do another and so we have to make some we have to make some commitments not resolutions we have to make some commitments we have to make some dedications to God in this new year of 5778 or 2018 and we need to believe that there are new beginnings around every corner this year and in every one of those new beginnings let it be a step closer to living his life I choose why don't you say that right now I choose to live the supernatural life I choose to live the life of Jesus Christ I choose to live the Ascended life how do I do that I don't even know where to begin well it always begins in God's Word and when I say that I don't just mean reading the scripture because the scripture in printed form can be a deadly unless we invite the Spirit of the Lord to come in and quicken that word and make it alive to us that's gonna be one of my prayers for you in 2018 that the Spirit of God would rest so mightily upon your life that when you sit down to read the word though it's familiar to you because perhaps you've read it over and over again I'm going to believe that there will be a fresh new anointing on that word and that you will receive revelation and understanding from God's Word perhaps that you've never had before because I'm learning every year of my life that it's revelation that gives me strength to defeat the enemy when he comes around with all of his lies it's not a fake so anymore we've got to know that we know that we know that we know and so I'm going to believe that 2018 will be a year of the supernatural life the year of the Ascended life and the year of the knowing that you know that you know that you know Matthew chapter 7 beginning in verse 21 and reading through verse 23 it's Jesus it's red letters and it's important words for you and I right now he said not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that were iniquity I don't know if there are many more words in Scripture that that seem so convicting and a bit sad to realize that Jesus is speaking about a time when many will come before him Lord Lord calling on his name testifying that they love him testifying that he has saved them from their sins but because they are not willing to live the surrendered life which is a life of obedience if God requires something from us he provides the grace that we need the strength that we need to do whatever it is that he's asking us whatever he requires he provides for you and I have to make a choice and not just once and for all we have to make a daily choice and sometimes we have to make it all through the day we have to choose over and over and over again to say yes to the will of God for our lives to say yes to the Word of God for our lives and then let our behavior let the things we do the things we say also reflect what we have said before and that is that we are calling on the name of the Lord Jesus goes on to to talk about something that I think is is helpful in understanding the verses that we just read and now we're gonna read in verse 24 also a Matthew chapter 7 therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock verse 26 and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell and great was the fall of it Jesus was telling the disciples it's not enough just to say Lord Lord you must hear the sayings and do the sayings if you're hearing the scripture and you're and you're moving forward to do to obey to live a life of covenant with him it's like the man who built this house on a rock you're building it on Jesus you're building it on a solid foundation and no matter what comes you're gonna know that you have stability to weather the storm because you're built on truth I'm telling you when we build our lives on lies they're going to crumble but when we build our lives on the truth of God's Word there's not a storm that the enemy can whip up that will take you under your house can remain I mean it may shift a little the wind may blow you you may wonder how you're gonna weather the stormy night but I'm telling you when your life is founded on truth you're not going to fall God is going to sustain you another portion of Scripture that the Lord was was kind of highlighting for me a few weeks ago was in Luke 6 verse 46 and why call me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say you see it's not enough to call ourselves Christians we've got to look for the Christ life the life of obedience to the scripture John 14 beautiful chapter verse 15 says if you love me you will keep my Commandments it's just simple I give you instruction if you love me you're gonna learn to obey my instructions verse 21 of the same chapter he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him this isn't about making the grade are getting the score this isn't about every time always doing it the right way there are going to be times that we fail there are going to be times that we slip they're going to be times that thoughts come into our mind that are not godly thoughts maybe even words come out that are not faith words that are not words of hope and words of strength we're gonna make bad choices we're going to enter into relationships at times that we shouldn't but I'm telling you when your house is built on truth you have the Holy Spirit living inside of you to quickly come and not condemn you but to convict you I think it's time for believers to learn the difference between condemnation and conviction the enemy will condemn you and offer you no way out when the enemy puts guilt and condemnation on you because of your failures your shortcomings in life he never offers an opportunity to do better he only tells you how terribly you did now he doesn't say this is the way to do better you know if you'll do one two three you'll be strengthened in that area oh no he just makes it look like you're an eternal failure and that's all you're ever going to be so the guilt just keeps you from calling out for the Lord's help conviction it's when the Spirit of God comes in and says no that was not the best choice that was not the right decision it's time for you to run back to truth it's time to run back to the safety of the house that is built on the rock if we're going to say that we love the Lord it's going to be important in 2018 that we live for him that we make better choices better choices for our health better choices for our relationships better choices with the way we witness the words we speak the behavior the habits things that we know we need help with but sometimes feel ashamed to ask the Lord I want you to know you don't have to be ashamed you don't have to feel guilty you don't have to feel embarrassed to ask the Lord they help you he desires to make all things new in your life it requires repentance it requires saying Lord I messed up I'm sorry forgive me I need your strength I need your help because I'm not gonna stay down I'm gonna get up and I'm gonna move forward in this fresh new year that you have blessed me to live in you've given me another opportunity to do more than just call you Lord but to make you the Lord of my life in John 14 verse 23 in fact just read the chapter mark it down make that part of your devotional time because both John 14 and 15 are powerful chapters jesus answered in verse 23 and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him I gotta read that again jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto Him and make our abode with him Jesus was clear in the Gospels to tell us that his father lived inside of him he said when you've seen me you have seen the father for I and my father are he also taught us that this was the desire that he had for those who would come to follow him not only his disciples who lived in the same time period but his disciples that would live hundreds and yes even 2,000 years later his desire for you and I is the same desire that he had for his disciples in the Second Temple period and that is that we would allow him to come in and live inside of us he brings with him the eternal spirit of the Father that lived inside of him because God is a spirit here o Israel the Lord is one he is one spirit and when he comes in then we receive that beautiful union that he had with his father he wants that union with you and I he wants us to live in oneness in union with him this is how we began to discover the ascended life the supernatural life or that are the Jesus life we call it we begin to realize that there's a man in here there's a spirit man in here directing us leading us he wants to direct your feelings not only your thoughts he wants to direct your feelings he wants to direct every part of who you are it starts with a great big surrender but it continues daily minute by minute if necessary this is going to be a year that we must not just call him Lord but we must make him Lord in every area of our life in some of my studies I discovered that there was a poem that was written carved in a Gothic medieval alphabet on a towering ornate Cathedral door right in the heart of a small town in Germany from the looks of that or the words that are carved there could have perhaps been carved in the time of Martin Luther it's possible because of its vicinity that Martin Luther may have seen these words carved on the door it's a it's a very important poem it's somber it must have been a message to the church at that particular time but I think it's a message for the church today for the believer today perhaps even more appropriate for the hour that we're living in now then it was hundreds of years ago the poem is sometimes called it's it was translated to English and the translated title you'll find variations of the title but it's often translated to read the lament of Jesus Christ against the ungrateful world if I could leave a word for you that I believe would help revolutionize your life in 2018 it would be gratitude or gratefulness Thanksgiving I believe that and I've done some research for several years now and I just recently read an article just emphasizing what takes place in a in a scientific way in a biological way in our own bodies when we are thankful when we are grateful for what God has given us in our lives I've seen so many people suggesting that we make journals that we make a list of things every day that we're grateful for the one thing I've learned I can't tell you that I write it down every day but the times that I have I find myself glossing through the bad parts of the day the more stressful times of the day in my mind and phone focusing on those things that I am most thankful for we're racing teenagers my wife and I and so maybe at the end of the day there's been a little conflict or something in the home or it's usually a little bit of sibling rivalry if you know what I mean and so maybe you're I'm a little tired or less stressed or something and I'm I'm thinking oh my boys sometimes it's my girls I we have two of each and when I take that moment to start being thankful and grateful for their health for god blessing my wife and i with them for their personalities for the way they make us proud for the ways that they make us laugh for the ways that I see God working in their heart if I focus on that instead of the strife the mistakes that they might have made maybe coming home in their mother telling me that a couple of them really didn't want to do their school that day they're homeschooled all of that just fades when we focus on what we're grateful for for the blessing for the benefit that God has given us it is amazing how dim how dismal everything it just it's just our shrinking away the things that have cost us so much stress during the day they just lose their importance in the light of all the blessings and benefits of God in our life I want to read this point because it grieves me deeply to think about our Lord leaving this message to his church calling us an ungrateful world here's what the poem says thus speak if Christ our Lord to us you call me eternal then do not seek me you call me fair then do not love me you call me gracious then do not trust me you call me just then do not fear me you call me life then do not choose me you call me light then do not see me you call me Lord then do not respect me you call me master then do not obey me you call me merciful and then do not thank me you call me mighty then do not honor me you call me noble then do not serve me you call me rich then do not ask me you call me Savior then do not praise me you call me Shepherd then do not follow me you call me way then do not walk with me you call me wise then do not heed me you call me son of God then do not worship Me when I sentence you do not blame me I don't know if those words penetrate your life the way they penetrated mine it's a powerful way of summarizing the way the average person treats the Lord in a Christian nation we know that he's God we know that he's good we know that he's powerful we know that he's our Savior our Shepherd he's wise we know so many things about him and then we don't take the opportunity to let him demonstrate those things in our life if God is good then we we must learn to trust him if God is wise we need to heed his counsel if God is mighty then we need to honor him if he's noble we need to serve Him I just felt like the Lord let me find this point I I remember reading it many years ago it didn't have the impact on me at the time that it did just a few weeks ago and I found it again and I believe that the Lord knows what we need at the right time I just want to say to you wherever you are watching I believe that many of you know that God is good that he is God that there is one God over the earth I believe that many of you were raised in church and you've been to Sunday School and you know so many things about him and yet you realize when carefully listening to the words of this poem that we know more about him than we're allowing him to be in our own life if God is God over the whole earth then why not let him be God at your house if God is capable of watching over every person in the whole wide world at the same time then why don't we trust him to watch over our own families it's time to cause our belief system and and what we really believe to line up with what we've been saying not just calling him Lord Lord because we want to distinguish ourselves from other non-christian religions and so we say I'm a Christian I am of Christ you know that's what it means when we say I'm a Christian it means I am of Christ and and if we're of Christ then we must let him be the Messiah we must let him be the Anointed One in our life I'm just sensing so deeply that for many of you 2017 was a year that you would like to forget and many of you didn't enter into 2018 with much more hope your expectation was like it often can be in any of our lives that it would just be the same old same old another year of the of the grind but I want you to know that that God has an incredible plan for you in this season if you're willing to do more than call him Lord but then stop and let him be Lord God was stealing with me about that new beginning and he started bringing some words to my mind with a prefix of rhe which which generally means to do over and I begin to jot them down and and I'm claiming them for my own life for our own ministry for the families in our own faith community and I didn't know I was going to share them with you now but I'd like to do that restart rebuild renew recover refresh realign recommit rededicate reconnect reboot refocus recalibrate revive revamp reposition recheck rethink redefine redirect recreate reinvent re-energize reconsider rekindle regain revise rewire that was all on my list I'm sure they're more maybe you're already thinking of them if we have connected and that we do it again it's a reconnect if we if we are thinking and we start thinking that thought again we're rethinking that thought if we are making Corrections or changes on something that we've already put together we're revising it reconsidering it and rethinking it out I believe the Lord was just saying that 2018 is a year of possibilities a chance to walk back through some of the decisions that we have made and make some better decisions some better choices to recommit to rededicate our lives he was also talking to me in prayer about the new beginnings because we've been we ever time 1/8 comes up we use that that meaning new beginning but I felt like the Spirit of the Lord was talking to me about a different kind of new beginning it's not totally new what in the world do you mean by that it's a new beginning of things that have been sewn into your life in past seasons promises made endeavors that you started things that you that you felt like the Lord was leading you to and you and you stepped out in faith and in the right direction you begin to move forward and something happened and you gave up you abandoned the plan and I felt like the Lord was dealing with my heart that this would be a good opportunity in faith to reclaim some of those new beginnings of the past let those new beginnings become new again in 2018 things that were sewn into your life maybe words of promise visions goals dreams that you wanted to accomplish for the kingdom of God maybe it was children's ministry maybe it was ministry to the homeless maybe it was youth ministry and you stepped out and you began to make some steps in the right direction and then circumstances went awry and you gave up and you didn't feel like you would ever go back and revisit those visions those goals those those desires that you had for the kingdom of God I think maybe 2018 is going to be the year for you to go back and revisit to go back and reconnect with what the Lord is sewn into your life in times past I wrote it this way things that were sown and then sprouted and began to grow but were somehow later neglected abandoned or choked out I don't know what happened to the goal I don't know what happened to the vision especially if it was something that God was putting in your heart I don't know what changed I don't know how the enemy moved against you to try to steal from you what God was desiring to do in your life I obviously could not know all of those details but I do believe that 2018 can be a new beginning from an old new beginning something that didn't completely come to fruition it just just began to sprout and something happened and it was no more I'd like to see God restore that that passion that you had for the kingdom of God maybe for your own family maybe maybe as a father you you started out a few years ago to carefully disciple your children to train them in the things of God something changed on your job maybe you had less time you were more exhausted when you came home in the evening so so that little bit of growth that you began to see in your children it withered away because of circumstances and how they changed wouldn't this be a wonderful time to go back and redeem that new beginning you maybe you made a resolution maybe you made a commitment and you started out and it went good for for a few weeks maybe you said one night a week around the dinner table we're gonna really focus on the things of God's Word and the spirit life I'm gonna really talk to my family and I'm going to really share with them and see what I can do to help disciple them and and teach them about relationship and then things changed the schedules changed everybody's not home at the same time you're doing good to to all get dinner almost impossible to get it all at the same time I don't know what has happened but I want you to know that this would be a real opportunity to take a little mental inventory to say Lord in in what areas did I begin to move forward and something happened maybe the enemy just put up such a an assault against your life he was so angry about the change the choices that you were making your dedication and maybe he just called an all-out war against your family whatever it was I just don't believe it's too late if there were if there are certain circumstances that almost make it look impossible I still believe that out of the remains of what was a new beginning I believe God can revamp he can actually restructure that in 2018 so that it even goes higher than it would have ever gone before so that it accomplishes more than it would have ever accomplished in the beginning I just feel like Redemption is a good word to share with you in 2018 whatever the enemy has stolen whatever the enemy has diverted in whatever area of your life the enemy has gotten in the arrangements he's God in the circumstances why don't we just in faith begin to speak confess God's word of restoration we see this amazing promise in the scripture concerning restoration of what the cankerworm and the Palmer worm and the locusts have eaten away we see that it was it was God restoring his truth back to a tree it was everything the enemy has stripped away and now God was restoring it layer by layer by layer that's redemption that's restoration that's God making restitution we've seen that throughout the church ages and I'd like to be able to say that I've seen that in my own life and I have indeed time and time again what about 2018 for you will you position your heart before the Lord right now will you commit to him I'm not just gonna be one who called you Lord Lord in this new year that you've given us but I'm going to be the one who makes you the Lord of my life instead of being so quick to do it my way I want to do it your way I want to be the man who's building or the woman who's building their house on a solid rock not just knowing truth but doing it not just knowing the instruction of the Lord but following his instruction one of the lines in the poem said you call me Shepherd but you do not follow me I I think that it would be so wonderful if in the few moments that we have left in the broadcast today we could just pray we could just say Lord I I'm sorry I'm sorry for the times that I testified you're the Good Shepherd Psalm 23 you know it's probably the most quoted or read portion of scripture at funerals many many times it's declared in a funeral over a life that has not let the Lord be the Shepherd of their life may it never be so about you may it never be so about any member of your family if if that would have been the way things were going in your life in 2017 let's determine that it will not be that way in this new year that the Lord has given us to serve Him we're gonna call you Shepherd and we're going to follow you where you lead we're gonna pasture we're gonna feed in the place that you lead us we're going to expect the blessing that we read about in Psalm 23 surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life why don't we just pray right now father I realize that my talking has been scattered a bit today but somehow I felt your pull in in different directions because I believe there are many different circumstances represented in those who are watching this program today and and I'm sitting here Lord for no other goal for no other motive but to help somebody to encourage somebody to give somebody hope that we're human and we're weak and we fail but you are God and you are strong and you never fail we make mistakes Lord and you never make a mistake we're really wrong sometime but you're always right and we just repent right now we call out in our homes wherever the broadcast is going right now for whoever feels the the calling of the Lord in your spirit right now we just repent yes we're children of God we're believers but we repent and we say we are sorry for the times that we called you Lord but we didn't let you be Lord for the times we called you Shepherd but we didn't follow you for the times that we called you strong but we we focused on our weakness instead of on your strength we just asked for your forgiveness right now and we just believe for redemption and Lord I'm believing right now for new beginnings in in in in old new beginnings in areas where there was a start a fresh start but it didn't last it wasn't sustained something happened I'm asking you right now Lord to restore what has been stolen away by the enemy I'm just believing God that that some of those watching this program right now will walk in the fulfillment of that promise that you gave in the scripture you will recover all Lord I ask you right now for somebody watching this program who has lost much but their faith has not wavered they've been discouraged but not to the point of giving up because like the disciples they knew there was nowhere else to go they knew there was nowhere else to run so they just kept running to you and even in those moments of discouragement they just kept running to you and you have sustained them all great loving God you have sustained them and so Lord I'm standing right now agreeing my faith with your faith the faith of the believer watching this program for your redemption for your restoration for your restitution and we just say to the enemy right now take your hands off of what God is releasing to the believers what God is releasing to those who not only know the word but they choose to obey the word Lord I'm thanking you right now for some solid houses for some houses and some lives and some families that have been built on a solid rock and the rain couldn't wash them away and the storms couldn't cause the house to crash and I'm praying Lord right now for somebody watching this program who built on the wrong foundation and their house crashed it fell flat and they're homeless maybe not in the natural but in the spiritual bankrupt homeless but I'm asking you right now Lord to give them another opportunity to build again hallelujah as long as there's time left there's lots of hope and I'm just believing that you have given me a divine appointment with somebody watching this program right now and that you are going to move as they surrender as they go back and say father I tried to build a house on what I knew but what I wouldn't practice what I knew but what I wouldn't obey and now I see it flat crumbled gone and I am asking you to come and help me build a house on the solid rock one that will never be flat Lord you're the healer and we ask you for healing for faith to rise up in those who are afflicted who are sick or diseased watching this program we bind the rid of infirmity in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we command you to take your hands off of God's people and we thank you Lord for sending the Holy Spirit of God to encourage every person watching this program today in the wonderful name of Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen well I'm just very thankful that you were tuned in with us today and I so many different things have been said in so many situations spoken to that I'm just trusting that yours was spoken to that your need was somehow addressed and that you're going to face 2018 with a lot of hope because you serve a great big wonderful God if you've not been serving him now's the time call him Lord and make him Lord we love you that's why we're partnering with the gospel channel to be a blessing and an encouragement in your life god bless you happy new year [Music]
