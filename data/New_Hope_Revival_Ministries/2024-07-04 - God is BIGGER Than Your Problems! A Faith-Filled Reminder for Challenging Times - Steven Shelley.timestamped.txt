[0:00] I want to remind you church that our God
[0:03] is greater than our
[0:05] enemy in every way in every way God's
[0:09] word defeats his enemy a and the one
[0:13] that has set out to destroy your life is
[0:15] already defeated and if we'll stop
[0:19] agreeing with him he has to tuck tail
[0:23] the Bible said submit yourselves
[0:24] therefore unto God resist the devil and
[0:28] you don't have to run from him
[0:30] what's the word say he'll flee from you
[0:34] but you're presented with an opportunity
[0:36] now moving forward toward the end of
[0:39] your destiny to to make sure that the
[0:42] report you give is one that says God is
[0:46] bigger than my problem he's bigger than
[0:49] my circumstance don't look at the
[0:53] bigness of your problem but rather look
[0:56] at the
[0:57] bigness of your God
[1:00] it's not easy to do that in the Heat of
[1:02] the Moment we've all been in those
[1:05] situations but when we choose to agree
[1:09] with the Lord in his word then we give a
[1:11] good report the best we can maybe our
[1:14] voice is trembling you know maybe we
[1:16] don't feel very strong but we're holding
[1:19] on to faith and giving God an
[1:22] opportunity to work don't shut God out
[1:25] of your
[1:26] circumstances let him in and let him
[1:29] have his way it's coming your promise is
[1:32] not as far away now as it was
[1:36] yesterday every day you wait for it
[1:39] every day you T for it in faith brings
[1:42] it one day
[1:44] closer if you spend the day in
[1:47] turmoil without faith you really push
[1:51] you push the
[1:53] promise you push the promise a little
[1:55] further out in the future somebody said
[1:58] you do that by your faith and your
[1:59] report well according to the word you do
[2:02] I'm just telling you what the book said
[2:04] we're waiting to recognize whose
[2:07] authority is within us the authority of
[2:10] Jesus Christ the first part of the
[2:13] creation of God brother if he's backing
[2:16] you up if you've got the word backing
[2:19] you up you don't have to be afraid of a
[2:21] family of giants you don't have to be
[2:24] afraid of somebody trying to intimidate
[2:26] you on your job you don't have to be
[2:28] afraid of peer pray you're at
[2:30] school if you know that you know that
[2:33] you know you're part of him the Bible
[2:36] tells us that those who know their
[2:40] God shall be what strong and do what
[2:47] exploits
[2:48] amazing
[2:50] demonstrations of God's character power
[2:53] and authority exploits there's a bride
[2:57] in the earth positioning by the spirit
[3:00] now getting in sync with our marching
[3:04] orders that are not of Earth they're not
[3:07] earthy they're coming from another place
[3:10] they're coming from an eternal realm and
[3:12] we're discovering that it's important
[3:14] for us to get in synchronization
[3:17] alignment with what the spirit is saying
[3:21] remember that before God speaks
[3:23] prophetically to the church ages he says
[3:26] hear what the spirit yes sir is saying
[3:31] to the church so the hearing choosing to
[3:35] hear is part of the alignment
