Description:
We ask, “How do we learn to obey the ways of God?”  By His Word.  The Bible is more than a decoration, God’s Holy Word has been preserved for us as roadmap, as the answer to every question, to reveal to us His will, to know where He’s been and where He’s going.  
But it does us little good to know His will, when we don’t understand the ways of God.  We must examine it and discover His heart, so we learn and understand His ways.  The way He moves and functions shows us how we can move in the will of God.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and we want to know where God is going we look to the word I want to say to you body of Christ that it is not enough to know the will of God we want to know the will of God without knowing the will of God we wonder aimlessly directionless we we have a tendency to go in circles in fact because we don't like to go too far beyond our comfort zone so I want to say to the church today it's not enough to know the will of God I think that sometimes our attitude is the highest is to know the will of God if I can know God's will for my life then I have really achieved something well I want you to know that until we know the way of God and until we are able to understand the ways of God it does us very little good to know the will of God because you can know the will of God and not understand the ways of God and Miss what you know you may know that it is God's will for you to go to a particular place but if you don't know the way of God you won't know how to get there in God's will [Music] and and how do we learn the way of God how do we learn the ways of God we look to the word if we want to know where God is we look to the word if we want to know where God has been we look to the word and we want to know where God is going we look to the word so that old dusty Bible sitting on the coffee table in your house it's time now to use it for more than a decoration it's time now to use it as a road map because God's holy word in printed form has been preserved for us as a road map it not only reveals to us the answer to every question in life it not only reveals to us the will of God for our lives but it also reveals the way of God Moses said I want to know your way that I may know you you see it's not enough to know what God has done you've got to examine what he's done to begin to try to discover his heart you may not always always know the wise but the more you learn about the way of God the way that God moves the way that God thinks the way that God functions the more you learn about the way of God the easier it becomes to get you into the will of God because you're not walking around with hobnailed shoes like fools Where Angels Fear to trod
