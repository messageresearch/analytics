[1:08:15] that you're here this morning you may be
[1:08:17] seated
[1:08:18] we have experienced already the presence
[1:08:21] of the Lord you see her
[1:08:24] maybe you're feeling a little bit tired
[1:08:27] you have partied this weekend with your
[1:08:30] Thanksgiving get-togethers and
[1:08:32] some of you are still in a turkey coma I
[1:08:35] can tell
[1:08:38] you but you know
[1:08:40] it's one time a year
[1:08:43] I'm glad
[1:08:47] and uh God deserves Our Praise again and
[1:08:52] again and above and again
[1:08:54] and it's good to be in the house of the
[1:08:56] Lord
[1:08:57] and even though we have many who are not
[1:08:59] with us today you're here
[1:09:02] and more importantly than that he's here
[1:09:05] he's here and we're here to lift him up
[1:09:08] and I have a word from the Lord for you
[1:09:10] in just a moment if you have come to
[1:09:12] hear from him I believe you will
[1:09:15] because I believe he's here
[1:09:18] you uh I didn't hear when when uh Ben
[1:09:22] was welcoming Deb he said gab so quickly
[1:09:25] until I didn't know who he was welcoming
[1:09:28] I didn't clap as hard as I would have if
[1:09:30] I'd have known who it was for
[1:09:31] but we're very glad to have gab with us
[1:09:34] from uh Quebec
[1:09:37] and that's a long way away
[1:09:39] French Canada
[1:09:41] and uh we have some good memories
[1:09:45] this church used to have a real
[1:09:47] connection with the church that Gab came
[1:09:49] out of I mean is is attending now
[1:09:54] grew up in
[1:09:55] and some of you will remember brother
[1:09:57] Andre petite who came here multiple
[1:10:00] times brother uh brother John Majors
[1:10:04] some of you will remember him
[1:10:06] and uh there are a few other brothers
[1:10:09] who I don't remember their name there
[1:10:11] were wives that came and there were
[1:10:13] wonderful people Dominique was with us
[1:10:16] for a while
[1:10:17] and we have hosted more than one
[1:10:21] occasion sister Cindy timmermans who
[1:10:24] married a brother from that church and
[1:10:26] they have visited with us here many
[1:10:28] times so
[1:10:29] we have a connection with those
[1:10:31] wonderful people there
[1:10:33] and we're glad that Gab is with us and
[1:10:35] then I heard brother Ben mentioning Josh
[1:10:38] Seiler this is Jump week is this week
[1:10:41] coming up I I don't understand exactly
[1:10:44] why someone would choose
[1:10:48] to jump out of a perfect perfectly good
[1:10:51] airplane
[1:10:53] you know it seems like you'd want to
[1:10:55] stay in but some people's job and
[1:10:58] commitment and career requires that they
[1:11:01] do and he's had far worse training than
[1:11:04] that harder training than that so this
[1:11:07] should be a breeze just wanted you to
[1:11:08] know we have full confidence in you I'm
[1:11:11] glad it's you
[1:11:15] so glad it's you and not me or my
[1:11:18] children
[1:11:19] I'm not interested in that I'm going to
[1:11:22] stay in the plane
[1:11:23] I have to get in them sometime for
[1:11:26] travel
[1:11:27] but the word says lo I will be with you
[1:11:30] always
[1:11:31] didn't say anything about
[1:11:34] but God is good
[1:11:37] brother Josh was talking Josh Yantis was
[1:11:40] talking about his uh flight going up to
[1:11:44] Maryland and he said Caleb said oh this
[1:11:48] is a Night Flight
[1:11:49] and Josh said it feels more like a
[1:11:51] fright flight
[1:11:53] so evidently it was a little bit rough
[1:11:56] you know I appreciate those who made the
[1:12:00] extra effort I know some were so far
[1:12:02] away that they couldn't get back for
[1:12:04] today
[1:12:06] but I appreciate those who made the
[1:12:08] extra effort to be with us today Josh
[1:12:11] and charity and Luke and Caleb took a
[1:12:14] Night Flight and didn't get to the house
[1:12:15] till about 1 30 this morning so they
[1:12:18] could be in church today I appreciate
[1:12:21] that dedication
[1:12:22] Benjamin and Jenna drove eight hours
[1:12:25] yesterday from Arkansas got in last
[1:12:28] night so that they could be in church
[1:12:29] today and I I want to mention that
[1:12:32] because I think it's something that that
[1:12:34] that should be mentioned and I know
[1:12:38] again that uh for instance brother
[1:12:41] Austin and sister Anna Christine were in
[1:12:43] Iowa well that's a long way to go and I
[1:12:46] understand that and they're streaming
[1:12:48] and I'm going to let them off the hook
[1:12:52] but if you're planning the trips and
[1:12:55] you're planning the Thanksgiving why why
[1:12:57] would you plan it on a Sunday
[1:13:00] when you know that we have one day of
[1:13:03] the week that we dedicate to the Lord so
[1:13:07] I appreciate you being here today and uh
[1:13:10] I know some people plan their getaways
[1:13:13] so that they can be gone on a Sunday but
[1:13:15] I like to try to plan mine so that I can
[1:13:18] be home because there's no place I would
[1:13:21] rather be if we would have sung the
[1:13:23] verse to that chorus there's no place
[1:13:25] I'd rather be than with the ones that
[1:13:27] have been set free
[1:13:30] that's right
[1:13:31] and so I want to honor those of you who
[1:13:34] are here and those of you who are not
[1:13:36] here but you're streaming and I want to
[1:13:38] acknowledge that and I want to
[1:13:41] acknowledge that that while
[1:13:44] while babies are coming
[1:13:47] sister Hannah is streaming the service
[1:13:49] from the hospital and Thanking us for
[1:13:52] our prayers
[1:13:55] so it must not be too intense yet
[1:14:00] or she might be screaming turn that
[1:14:02] thing off and let me have this baby
[1:14:05] but anyway we send our love to her and
[1:14:09] those who are streaming in various
[1:14:11] places Arkansas Kentucky Missouri uh God

[1:14:24] uh Saints in Indiana Saints in Vancouver
[1:14:27] British Columbia Saints in the
[1:14:30] Netherlands Saints in Athens Georgia and
[1:14:34] just wherever you are streaming the
[1:14:36] service we recognize that there are all
[1:14:40] kinds of channels there are all kinds of
[1:14:42] services being streamed and we're
[1:14:44] honored that you would choose to be a
[1:14:46] part of ours and may God bless you and I
[1:14:51] looked at the calendar can I have just a
[1:14:53] little more volume in my Monitor here
[1:14:57] um I looked at the calendar I didn't see
[1:14:59] birthdays this week
[1:15:01] somebody surely must be having a
[1:15:03] birthday
[1:15:04] but I didn't see one on the calendar
[1:15:07] and but there is a very special day
[1:15:11] tomorrow
[1:15:13] and that is Sister Stacy and I are
[1:15:17] celebrating our wedding anniversary
[1:15:21] number 25.

[1:15:35] here honey could I interest you in those
[1:15:37] they're real silver
[1:15:38] I don't know what I'm supposed to buy
[1:15:40] for a silver we certainly don't need to
[1:15:43] buy a 25 plaque do we we don't need
[1:15:45] anything else stuck around the house for
[1:15:47] sure
[1:15:48] and somebody said what are you going to
[1:15:51] do for your anniversary well a couple
[1:15:53] years ago we started talking about going
[1:15:55] to Hawaii
[1:15:57] and uh
[1:16:04] and uh
[1:16:06] but we don't eat pig and so we couldn't
[1:16:09] do a luau
[1:16:10] and the next thing you know so many
[1:16:13] wanted to go with us it was going to
[1:16:15] turn into a tour group or something
[1:16:18] and even Hunter amalong said I'm going
[1:16:21] with you and sister Stacy on your
[1:16:23] anniversary trip so we just canceled the
[1:16:25] whole thing
[1:16:29] I hope somebody'll play that for Hunter
[1:16:32] we just canceled the whole thing
[1:16:34] you're not going to be a party crasher
[1:16:37] oh we're going to do something exotic uh
[1:16:40] but it'll be a couple months before we
[1:16:42] do and and we're we're thinking we might
[1:16:45] go to the Caribbean or something we're a
[1:16:47] little more interested in that maybe
[1:16:48] right now than Hawaii because we would
[1:16:51] like to take our kids to Hawaii I would
[1:16:54] love to stand in Pearl Harbor with my
[1:16:56] kids I'd like for them to be able to see
[1:16:57] that as well
[1:16:59] so we're going to dinner that's our big
[1:17:02] celebration
[1:17:03] and somebody said just you and your wife
[1:17:06] no no
[1:17:08] all the kids too
[1:17:10] somebody said that's kind of sad no
[1:17:13] it's not sad at all that's exactly what
[1:17:17] we want
[1:17:18] we want that your life changes you just
[1:17:22] your life just changes when you have
[1:17:25] kids especially if you like them
[1:17:30] it's a plus
[1:17:32] it's a plus if you like them and you
[1:17:35] enjoy their company so that's it that's
[1:17:37] those of you who've asked that's what
[1:17:39] we're going to do we're going to dinner
[1:17:41] with the kids and no you're not invited
[1:17:44] but uh we'll go with you another time if
[1:17:46] you invite us and uh but I want to say
[1:17:49] to my wife you deserve much more than
[1:17:52] silver
[1:17:53] you deserve a lot of crowns your crowns
[1:17:58] are going to be so many and so heavy
[1:18:00] that it's going to take angels to help
[1:18:01] you carry them because anybody who can
[1:18:04] live with me for 25 years serve me the
[1:18:06] way you have and our family you deserve
[1:18:10] to be mentioned I love you very much I'm
[1:18:13] very very thankful for you
[1:18:16] 25 years
[1:18:21] well if you
[1:18:24] if you ask her you know in the marriage
[1:18:27] counseling sometimes people will ask her
[1:18:29] questions they'll say you know how long
[1:18:31] is it hard
[1:18:33] well after a year she said that first
[1:18:36] year can be really hard
[1:18:39] and then after five years I heard her
[1:18:41] tell somebody well those first five
[1:18:43] years they can be really hard
[1:18:49] and ten years come along I heard her
[1:18:51] telling somebody well if you can get
[1:18:52] through the first 10 years
[1:18:56] so I have a feeling that if you ask her
[1:18:58] today
[1:18:59] she would say if you can manage the
[1:19:02] first 25 years you should be all right
[1:19:05] it's not easy if someone tells you it is
[1:19:08] they're not being completely honest
[1:19:11] it's not easy but if if someone makes
[1:19:14] you feel like it's not worth it they're
[1:19:16] very wrong it's worth every minute of it
[1:19:20] when you know that you have got the one
[1:19:23] that God chose for you in eternity the
[1:19:26] one you're going to spend eternity with
[1:19:29] then no matter how you might struggle or
[1:19:32] what may come along you'll get through
[1:19:35] it if you let Jesus be not the silent
[1:19:38] someone said you know we need Jesus to
[1:19:41] be the silent partner in the marriage
[1:19:43] well if he ain't talking
[1:19:45] he's not really involved is he no he he
[1:19:48] needs to be the one doing the talking
[1:19:51] the leadership and helping and guiding
[1:19:53] and directing and I don't know how
[1:19:55] anybody makes it without the Lord I
[1:19:57] don't know how any marriage survives
[1:19:59] without the Lord do you but I feel like
[1:20:01] I'm a very blessed man and um and I'm
[1:20:05] thankful very very thankful thank you
[1:20:07] for praying for ma she is stronger
[1:20:11] and um she is still very distant and she
[1:20:15] doesn't recognize us but she's breathing
[1:20:18] a whole lot better than she was and
[1:20:20] we're thankful for that and uh would ask
[1:20:23] that you would continue to pray for her
[1:20:25] that God will help her as long as her
[1:20:27] days and hours are on this Earth
[1:20:29] she needs the Lord's help and I want you
[1:20:32] to to keep praying for her if you will
[1:20:34] are you ready for the word let's stand
[1:20:39] I'm going back to the book of beginnings
[1:20:43] Genesis let's thank God for these
[1:20:46] musicians
[1:20:48] singers and worship leaders
[1:20:51] let's do better than that come on let's
[1:20:54] thank God for them
[1:20:56] thank God for them
[1:21:00] [Applause]
[1:21:03] oh
[1:21:06] no darling
[1:21:07] my wife texted me she said you said the
[1:21:10] kids were coming to dinner Nora wants to
[1:21:12] know if she's coming too
[1:21:16] oh dear
[1:21:19] Genesis 1 beginning in verse 11.
[1:21:23] and God said
[1:21:25] let the Earth
[1:21:27] bring forth grass
[1:21:30] the herb yielding seed
[1:21:34] and the fruit tree
[1:21:37] yielding fruit after his kind
[1:21:42] whose seed is in itself upon the Earth
[1:21:46] and it was so
[1:21:48] uh let me paralyze uh paralyze
[1:21:53] let me paralyze that verse let me
[1:21:56] paraphrase that verse by saying what
[1:21:58] brother Branham said he said every Apple
[1:22:01] that was ever going to be in the Earth
[1:22:03] was represented in that first apple tree
[1:22:06] that God made the seed was there and
[1:22:09] that was the potential of every Apple
[1:22:12] that was ever going to be in the earth
[1:22:13] and I think that's a powerful way of
[1:22:16] expressing what this verse is saying
[1:22:19] and the Earth brought forth grass and
[1:22:23] Herb yielding seed after his kind just
[1:22:25] like God said
[1:22:27] and the tree yielding fruit whose seed
[1:22:30] was in itself after his kind and God saw
[1:22:34] that it was
[1:22:37] Tov good it was tof
[1:22:41] and the evening and the morning
[1:22:43] were the
[1:22:45] third day not the morning and the
[1:22:47] evening but the evening and the morning
[1:22:49] because the new day begins not when it's
[1:22:53] getting light
[1:22:54] the new day begins when it's still dark
[1:22:57] outside don't ever forget that
[1:23:00] according to the Bible the new day
[1:23:02] begins when it's still dark
[1:23:05] so if you're waiting on the sun to rise
[1:23:08] to declare the new day you're waiting
[1:23:12] too long
[1:23:13] you've got to declare that the sun s-o-n
[1:23:16] has risen even though it may look very
[1:23:19] dark in the world around us can you say
[1:23:22] Amen
[1:23:24] and God said let there be lights in the
[1:23:29] firmament
[1:23:30] of the heaven to divide the day from the
[1:23:35] night
[1:23:36] so understand that this creation of sun
[1:23:40] and moon was to divide light from
[1:23:45] Darkness night from day
[1:23:49] to divide the day from the night and let
[1:23:52] them be
[1:23:53] sun moon and stars let them be for signs
[1:23:59] for seasons
[1:24:02] and for days
[1:24:05] and years let me read this verse again
[1:24:09] and God said let there be lights in the
[1:24:12] firmament of the heaven to divide the
[1:24:15] day from the night
[1:24:16] and let them be foresigns and for
[1:24:20] seasons and for days
[1:24:24] and years
[1:24:27] before you're seated if you'll turn with
[1:24:30] me to Ecclesiastes
[1:24:33] chapter 3
[1:24:35] beginning in verse 1
[1:24:37] you're very familiar with this portion
[1:24:40] of scripture I'm sure
[1:24:44] to everything
[1:24:46] there is a season
[1:24:50] to everything there's a season
[1:24:53] and the time
[1:24:54] to every purpose
[1:24:57] under heaven
[1:24:59] we're going to verse 8 all the way down
[1:25:01] a time to be born
[1:25:04] and a time to die
[1:25:06] a time to plant
[1:25:07] and the time to pluck up that which is
[1:25:09] planted A Time to Kill and a time to
[1:25:13] heal a time to break down and a time to
[1:25:17] build up a time to weep and a time to
[1:25:21] laugh a time to mourn and a time to
[1:25:24] dance a time to Cast Away stones and a
[1:25:28] time to gather Stones together a time to
[1:25:31] embrace and a time to refrain from
[1:25:35] embracing a time to get and a time to
[1:25:39] lose a time to keep
[1:25:41] and a time to Cast Away a time to Rend
[1:25:46] and a time to sow
[1:25:49] a time to keep silence and a time to

[1:25:57] and a time to hate
[1:25:59] a time of War
[1:26:01] and a time of peace
[1:26:04] to everything
[1:26:06] there is a season
[1:26:08] and the time
[1:26:10] for every purpose under Heaven let's
[1:26:14] pray together father
[1:26:16] we thank you today that you are allowing
[1:26:19] us once again to approach your word
[1:26:23] it's holy
[1:26:25] it's sacred even in its printed form it
[1:26:30] is Holy
[1:26:32] even in its electronic form it is sacred
[1:26:36] it's precious it's valuable
[1:26:41] we recognize that it is you
[1:26:44] it is a written expression of who you
[1:26:48] are your thoughts
[1:26:50] expressed to us
[1:26:52] it is a guide a road map
[1:26:57] it is encouragement and also correction
[1:27:02] it is strength
[1:27:04] and at times renders us weak
[1:27:09] convicted
[1:27:11] brokenhearted when we see how far we
[1:27:15] have fallen from your truth
[1:27:18] restore us today Lord we pray
[1:27:22] refresh us
[1:27:24] renew us
[1:27:26] may we be recreated by the spirit of the
[1:27:31] most high God may we be quickened
[1:27:34] and Made Alive by The Living Word
[1:27:38] we are in relationship with the Living
[1:27:42] Word the written word is our marriage
[1:27:46] covenant it is our katuba it is our
[1:27:50] contract with you you sealed it with
[1:27:54] your own blood
[1:27:55] we love it because it's your gift to us
[1:27:59] but more than loving your written word
[1:28:02] we love you
[1:28:04] because you are the living reality of
[1:28:06] that word and we will glorify your name
[1:28:09] for every way in which you help us today
[1:28:13] and we ask that you strengthen the
[1:28:15] saints that they might exercise their
[1:28:18] faith and they might that they might
[1:28:21] also use the power of the amen of the
[1:28:25] agreement in sealing this word into
[1:28:29] their own hearts and lives and we'll
[1:28:31] give you glory and honor and praise for
[1:28:35] it's in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:28:37] Christ
[1:28:39] Yeshua hamashiach we pray and the saint
[1:28:42] said
[1:28:44] amen you may be seated are you ready I'm
[1:28:46] not sure but the time has come
[1:28:50] I want you to look at somebody
[1:28:53] I don't care who it is
[1:28:55] it can be the one next to you or the one
[1:28:57] across the room but I want you to look
[1:28:59] at somebody and I want you to say to
[1:29:01] them it's time for a change
[1:29:07] it's huge
[1:29:11] you might be telling them that uh
[1:29:13] they need a little more deodorant
[1:29:21] you you you you might be telling them
[1:29:23] they don't need quite as much perfume
[1:29:27] you could be saying something a lot
[1:29:29] deeper than that you could be telling
[1:29:31] them that the five pounds of of pumpkin
[1:29:34] pie and turkey aren't agreeing with them
[1:29:36] and they need to do something about I
[1:29:39] don't know what you mean when you say it
[1:29:42] but it's just a good thing to say
[1:29:45] I want to remind you that before there
[1:29:47] were computers and iPads and cell phones
[1:29:49] and watches and even paper and pencil
[1:29:53] God gave us something
[1:29:56] to help us keep track of where we are
[1:29:59] concerning time we just read that to you
[1:30:02] in the scripture if you don't know where
[1:30:05] you are
[1:30:06] you'll never be able to determine where
[1:30:09] you're going
[1:30:12] in God
[1:30:14] seasons
[1:30:16] and what to do
[1:30:18] and when to do
[1:30:20] what we know to do
[1:30:22] we need to be able to understand that
[1:30:26] there are times of ebb
[1:30:29] when the waters draw back
[1:30:32] and there are times of flow when the
[1:30:35] waters push forward we are a spirit
[1:30:39] people
[1:30:40] we are a people that are called to walk
[1:30:43] not by the flesh
[1:30:45] but by the spirit the Bible tells us
[1:30:49] lean not to your own understanding but
[1:30:52] in all thy ways acknowledge Him and what
[1:30:56] will he do
[1:30:57] he will direct our path
[1:31:00] you'll never have to stumble if you're
[1:31:04] following the leadership of the spirit
[1:31:07] may God help every one of us to tune our
[1:31:11] spiritual ear you've got physical ears
[1:31:14] and you've got five physical senses but
[1:31:18] you also have spiritual senses and we as
[1:31:22] a people are learning not only to
[1:31:25] utilize our natural senses but we are
[1:31:29] learning to exercise to put are you with
[1:31:32] me
[1:31:33] to put in action our spiritual senses to
[1:31:38] be able to discern and by the way the
[1:31:42] gift of Suspicion is not one of the nine
[1:31:45] gifts of the Spirit
[1:31:47] some people call discernment
[1:31:51] when really they're operating in a
[1:31:54] spirit of suspicion
[1:31:56] God's not pleased with that
[1:31:59] you can come out on the wrong end
[1:32:02] if I could just have a little more maybe
[1:32:03] somewhere brother RJ in the house or up
[1:32:06] here I know it seems that when you put
[1:32:08] it up here it's squealing but I just
[1:32:11] need a little bit of a fuller sound so
[1:32:13] that I don't don't feel like I'm
[1:32:14] screaming but I don't want to I don't
[1:32:16] want to be too loud for you all either
[1:32:18] maybe I'm already very loud to you
[1:32:22] and I don't want to do that
[1:32:25] without seasons in our life
[1:32:28] those Ebbs and flows
[1:32:31] those times to embrace and those times
[1:32:34] to refrain from embracing
[1:32:37] those times to mourn
[1:32:40] and those times to dance and celebrate
[1:32:44] without those seasons in our life we can
[1:32:48] become extremely frustrated
[1:32:51] because we are doing things in the wrong
[1:32:56] timing
[1:32:58] come on now
[1:32:59] in the wrong season
[1:33:03] it's not only crucial to do the right
[1:33:06] thing
[1:33:07] it's also crucial to do the right thing
[1:33:10] at the right time
[1:33:13] otherwise you can do the right thing in
[1:33:15] the wrong season and not receive the
[1:33:18] Harvest that you are sowing for
[1:33:21] does anybody understand what I'm what
[1:33:24] I'm saying
[1:33:26] doing things at the right time is very
[1:33:28] very crucial therefore understanding the
[1:33:31] seasons of the Lord are very important
[1:33:34] you need to know when God is trying to
[1:33:36] build up the church
[1:33:37] and you need to know when God's trying
[1:33:39] to bring it back down to a to a little
[1:33:42] more of a of a time of of Consecration
[1:33:45] and dedication a time to be on top of
[1:33:48] the horse
[1:33:48] riding in Victory and a time to be
[1:33:51] underneath him right down on the bottom
[1:33:54] with your face on the ground calling out
[1:33:56] to God for his Sovereign will to be
[1:33:59] revealed in your life I want you to know
[1:34:01] that when God was creating the sun and
[1:34:03] the moon and the stars he could have
[1:34:06] caused the sun to shine all the time 24
[1:34:09] hours of the day and had he done that
[1:34:12] there would be there would never be a
[1:34:14] change in the seasons
[1:34:16] if he did that we would never know many
[1:34:21] things
[1:34:22] if the sun should shine 24 hours of the
[1:34:25] day seven days a week 365 days of the
[1:34:29] year we would never know when to rest
[1:34:33] of being someone who has spent some
[1:34:35] considerable time in Iceland and other
[1:34:37] places
[1:34:39] referred to like Norway and places like
[1:34:42] that the land of the Midnight Sun
[1:34:45] I want you to know when it is midnight
[1:34:48] outside in still daylight it's hard to
[1:34:50] rest
[1:34:51] it's hard to go to sleep your body is
[1:34:54] responding to the light and it really
[1:34:58] can throw off your your body clock
[1:35:00] so we need to know when it's time to
[1:35:03] rest and we need to know when it's time
[1:35:05] to plant and we need to know when it's
[1:35:08] time to harvest what we've planted
[1:35:10] seasons are important
[1:35:12] and the sun ceasing to shine at some
[1:35:17] point of the day is an important part of
[1:35:19] God's creation I assure you that
[1:35:22] Evolution didn't do that I assure you
[1:35:25] that it didn't just happen happenstance
[1:35:27] I can assure you that a Creator all wise
[1:35:31] God all knowledgeable God all-knowing
[1:35:35] God created things the way they are
[1:35:39] he created seasons in first Chronicles
[1:35:43] chapter 12 and verse 32 and I'm I'm
[1:35:48] doing this the way I'm doing it for a
[1:35:51] reason so I hope it won't throw you off
[1:35:53] I hope you'll just stay with me and of
[1:35:55] the children of issachar which were men
[1:35:59] that had understanding of the times
[1:36:03] God help us
[1:36:06] this is Old Testament
[1:36:08] and there was a particular man who had
[1:36:11] descendants and those descendants
[1:36:15] seemed to be
[1:36:17] particularly attuned to understanding
[1:36:21] times
[1:36:24] to such a degree that they would know
[1:36:26] what Israel
[1:36:28] ought to do
[1:36:30] the heads of them were 200 and all their
[1:36:33] Brethren were at their commandment can
[1:36:35] you imagine there being 200 men Among Us
[1:36:38] in the body of Christ
[1:36:41] who could understand the times who could
[1:36:44] tell us what we should be doing as a
[1:36:47] nation what we should be doing as a
[1:36:50] church body what we should be doing as a
[1:36:53] family of Faith what we should be doing
[1:36:55] as an individual somebody who lived so
[1:36:59] close to the heartbeat of God
[1:37:02] that they can lay their head over on his
[1:37:06] chest and discern the very beat of his
[1:37:10] heart for his people
[1:37:12] we need that in this hour
[1:37:15] it's not a prophet a prophet that we
[1:37:19] need in this hour what we need is a
[1:37:22] prophetic people
[1:37:24] we need a company of prophetic people
[1:37:27] now when I say that I'm not referring to
[1:37:30] the fact that God has already sent us a
[1:37:32] messenger
[1:37:33] he's done his job
[1:37:36] and in spite of what some people believe
[1:37:38] he finished it
[1:37:39] and he finished it well
[1:37:41] he's not coming back for a one-man
[1:37:44] Resurrection
[1:37:47] he's not going to go across this country
[1:37:49] preaching under a tent
[1:37:53] no no that's a spiritual vision
[1:37:56] you know I I'm amazed sometime I don't
[1:37:58] want to get too far off this I've worked
[1:38:00] too hard
[1:38:01] I don't want to get too far off but I'm
[1:38:03] amazed sometime at how carnal men are
[1:38:06] always trying to interpret spiritual
[1:38:07] visions and dreams
[1:38:09] really really dangerous to do
[1:38:13] for instance you take this experience
[1:38:15] that brother Branham had what we now
[1:38:17] call the tent vision
[1:38:20] and you remember that he was fishing
[1:38:24] and you remember that he was having a
[1:38:27] hard time getting it just right
[1:38:31] you know he was snatching too hard
[1:38:34] wasn't he snatched fish and everything
[1:38:39] one part of that Vision he had just a a
[1:38:42] little old fish it was so little that it
[1:38:45] was just stretched over the lure
[1:38:47] they're stretched over the bay such a
[1:38:49] pit of a little thing and these other
[1:38:51] preachers were standing around and that
[1:38:53] made brother Brandon a bit nervous and
[1:38:55] that's spiritual
[1:38:57] brother bantam's not coming back to take
[1:38:59] us all fishing
[1:39:01] I'm saying this for a reason
[1:39:03] and then there was another part of that
[1:39:05] where brother Brandon was was uh lacing
[1:39:09] a little moccasin a little child's
[1:39:11] moccasin is that right if I get the
[1:39:13] details wrong help me but make sure you
[1:39:15] know it when you do
[1:39:17] a little moccasin and and it was being
[1:39:20] laced and and the little thing on the
[1:39:23] end it was seeming like it was hard to
[1:39:26] get that that big end of that lace into
[1:39:30] the moccasin now brother Brandon is not
[1:39:32] going to come back and lace your baby's
[1:39:33] moccasins for her
[1:39:36] it was spiritual
[1:39:39] you you can't teach
[1:39:42] algebra
[1:39:45] to these Pentecostal babies who refuse
[1:39:48] to learn their ABCs is anybody with me
[1:39:52] you you get in the flesh you're gonna
[1:39:55] mess up
[1:39:57] you try to do it your way
[1:40:00] you're gonna mess up you try to force
[1:40:03] something to work
[1:40:06] and it's not going to work and then he
[1:40:09] was carried away to the tent vision
[1:40:11] now I know that they're preaching it
[1:40:14] right when they talk about the moccasin
[1:40:16] they say that's spiritual
[1:40:18] and when they talk about the fishing
[1:40:20] experience that's spiritual they say
[1:40:22] then all of a sudden they begin to look
[1:40:25] for a physical tent
[1:40:28] God is a god of continuity when he gives
[1:40:31] an experience like that that comes in
[1:40:33] three courses one is not going to
[1:40:35] contradict the other
[1:40:37] come on now
[1:40:39] somebody had to think this through and
[1:40:42] when you do you will understand that
[1:40:44] that we don't need an airplane
[1:40:48] and some of you may not be aware of this
[1:40:50] I think some of you are but there were
[1:40:52] some brothers who brother Branham spoke
[1:40:54] to about the airplane and and how we
[1:40:56] would get around in the tent vision and
[1:40:58] brother random was not in any way
[1:41:01] thinking about a time after his death
[1:41:05] he was hoping
[1:41:08] he was a man
[1:41:10] he was hoping that this great tent
[1:41:13] Ministry was going to be the climax of
[1:41:15] his ministry before he died
[1:41:18] and so he said to somebody just stay
[1:41:21] with me
[1:41:22] that this may be may not be for you but
[1:41:25] you're not all there is
[1:41:29] somebody may need to hear something like
[1:41:31] this
[1:41:32] and and so uh
[1:41:36] he said to one you know you can drive
[1:41:38] the truck
[1:41:41] well maybe
[1:41:44] because I know I know a multitude of men
[1:41:47] who claim the same thing
[1:41:50] same come same conversation same truck
[1:41:53] driving job I don't know how many trucks
[1:41:55] it was going to take to get this kin
[1:41:57] around
[1:41:58] and he said to one you can help me help
[1:42:01] me on the platform
[1:42:03] and you could help and because he was a
[1:42:06] prophet they believed that everything he
[1:42:08] said was prophetic
[1:42:10] and so they believe that that these
[1:42:13] things were going to come to pass and
[1:42:14] was it what kind of plane was it a was
[1:42:17] it a DC-3
[1:42:22] they bought the plane
[1:42:26] the plane remains
[1:42:29] not ready
[1:42:31] but there in case it needs to be ready
[1:42:34] the money was put in an account
[1:42:38] so that the tent could be purchased
[1:42:41] even after brother Branham died
[1:42:44] because they got this in their mind if
[1:42:47] he said it it has to come to pass if he
[1:42:49] just casually said you can drive my tent
[1:42:52] my truck you can be a stage you you
[1:42:54] could do it then it has to come to pass
[1:42:56] like that so after brother random died
[1:42:58] they began to try to interpret this
[1:43:02] Vision
[1:43:03] that was part one spiritual part two
[1:43:08] spiritual they took part three and tried
[1:43:11] to make it natural and they began to
[1:43:13] preach what they call a return Ministry
[1:43:17] and I have precious friends who are
[1:43:20] waiting on the resurrection of brother
[1:43:21] Branham believing that one day he's
[1:43:24] coming he is
[1:43:26] watch yourself
[1:43:27] he is coming out of the Grave one day so
[1:43:30] is my grandma
[1:43:35] saints that have gone before it is not a
[1:43:38] one-man Resurrection we're looking for
[1:43:40] we're looking for a bridal Resurrection
[1:43:43] and in that hour yes the Bride of every
[1:43:46] age will gather with the messenger of
[1:43:48] that age absolutely right and we're
[1:43:51] looking for that but we're not looking
[1:43:54] for the natural fulfillment of attempt
[1:44:01] isn't it amazing how we can we can get
[1:44:04] so off
[1:44:06] when we try to make something work
[1:44:11] that's why there are times and seasons
[1:44:14] in God
[1:44:16] if you could get a group of people we're
[1:44:18] about 85 strong this morning with a lot
[1:44:21] of people missing
[1:44:22] if you could get a group of 85 people in
[1:44:26] one mind and one Accord prayed up
[1:44:29] loving one another like sister Flo was
[1:44:32] talking about all with their head
[1:44:35] leaning on the Lord trying to hear what
[1:44:37] he wants to do in this hour and throwing
[1:44:40] everything that we have and everything
[1:44:42] we are behind that to make it happen and
[1:44:45] when I say make it I don't mean as
[1:44:47] though we control it I mean so that
[1:44:50] we're not standing in the way of it
[1:44:52] how many of you would just say I don't
[1:44:54] want to be in the way of what God is
[1:44:57] doing
[1:44:58] if I can't get behind it I don't want to
[1:45:01] be in the way
[1:45:03] prevent it anybody following me so far
[1:45:06] oh what could you do with 85 people who
[1:45:10] had their head on the Lord's chest to
[1:45:13] hear what he wants for his bride in 2023
[1:45:17] you know we're about to end the
[1:45:19] Gregorian year
[1:45:21] and we're about to launch forth into a
[1:45:24] new Gregorian year the Year of 2023 and
[1:45:28] I want you to know for one I for one am
[1:45:31] very ready
[1:45:33] come on
[1:45:36] I'm ready for a new season in God
[1:45:40] it doesn't always run concurrently with
[1:45:43] the Gregorian calendar it doesn't always
[1:45:45] run concurrently with the Hebrew
[1:45:47] calendar
[1:45:49] you can have seasons in Christ and God
[1:45:52] in the spirit that last a day
[1:45:56] some a week
[1:45:57] some months
[1:45:59] some years
[1:46:01] brother Branham talked about cycles and
[1:46:05] seasons in his own life
[1:46:08] where he would get so nervous he could
[1:46:10] hardly stand it where eventually his
[1:46:13] stomach would become so diseased
[1:46:18] that he had to go to visit the Mayo
[1:46:20] brothers to get some help for his
[1:46:23] condition and then one day out of the
[1:46:26] blue
[1:46:27] God did for him what Mayo couldn't do
[1:46:31] he just came and healed him
[1:46:33] he let him see that little squirrel
[1:46:36] Spirit self on the cactus and Sabino
[1:46:40] Canyon and that was the end of that
[1:46:42] never to repeat that cycle again
[1:46:45] brother Branham talks about cycles of
[1:46:48] various durations seven years five years
[1:46:50] ten years 12.
[1:46:53] we don't know how long a particular
[1:46:56] season lasts but we need to understand
[1:46:59] that you as an individual may be on one
[1:47:02] cycle
[1:47:03] and the body of Christ at large may be
[1:47:07] on another cycle and a church family
[1:47:09] like this may be on another cycle or
[1:47:12] another season so you've got to learn to
[1:47:15] live multi-dimensional
[1:47:17] you've got to learn to live
[1:47:20] multi-seasonal you've got to learn to be
[1:47:22] patient for some that are still in the
[1:47:24] grieving process when you feel like
[1:47:27] dancing your shoes off
[1:47:30] you've got to understand that
[1:47:32] individually we may not all be at the
[1:47:34] same place spiritually
[1:47:36] but as a body we have another identity
[1:47:39] we are identified as individuals but we
[1:47:43] are also identified as a body of Christ
[1:47:45] and as a local assembly we like to call
[1:47:49] it it's a family of Faith that's what it
[1:47:51] is and it is electric eclectic
[1:47:55] it is eccentric
[1:48:00] it's downright strange at times
[1:48:05] but we've got to learn
[1:48:09] that we are not robots
[1:48:12] and neither are we clones I'm preaching
[1:48:14] to the little church this morning I hope
[1:48:16] you hear me we're not clones of one
[1:48:18] another
[1:48:19] we're going to process life differently
[1:48:21] than each other and we've got to learn
[1:48:24] to do it while walking in sync with the
[1:48:26] body of Christ
[1:48:28] somebody said I have no hope for that I
[1:48:30] wouldn't either except I read in the
[1:48:32] Bible that there were 200 sons of
[1:48:34] issachar who caught this inspiration to
[1:48:37] be able to discern what God would be
[1:48:40] Desiring for Israel at any particular
[1:48:43] time
[1:48:44] so there are going to be those who
[1:48:46] discern for the nation and there will be
[1:48:48] those who discern as a leader for their
[1:48:52] own local assemblies brother Branham
[1:48:54] reminds us the highest spiritual order
[1:48:56] in any local church is the pastor so if
[1:48:59] I were you I would pray for my pastors
[1:49:04] I would pray that God would help them to
[1:49:08] capture the season for the body
[1:49:12] then I would pray for myself as an
[1:49:15] individual that God would help me to
[1:49:17] keep in staff
[1:49:19] with what he's doing seasonally because
[1:49:22] I want you to know as you look to one
[1:49:24] another a few moments ago and you said
[1:49:26] change is coming I want to say to you as
[1:49:29] a pastor I want to prophesy to you as
[1:49:32] his servant that change is coming the
[1:49:35] season again is changing
[1:49:38] spiritually now I don't know where you
[1:49:41] are individually I'm not I'm not
[1:49:44] speaking to that right this moment I'm
[1:49:47] speaking to where we are as a body we're
[1:49:49] about to go up
[1:49:51] we're about to climb a notch
[1:49:54] God dealt with me through the night in
[1:49:56] dreams and I'm not ready to preach about
[1:49:59] those dreams but I would like to share
[1:50:02] one portion of a dream I saw a sister
[1:50:07] a person that I love and respect
[1:50:11] and in my in my Exchange in this dream
[1:50:15] last night I'm not you know I don't want
[1:50:18] to elevate dreams
[1:50:20] but I am
[1:50:22] going on 55 years old
[1:50:25] and I have been a Visionary to see
[1:50:28] visions
[1:50:29] so I have to watch my dreams the Bible
[1:50:31] said young men see Visions old men dream
[1:50:33] dreams I have to at least watch them at
[1:50:35] times and see if there's anything
[1:50:38] that might help guide us or direct us or
[1:50:40] lead us and we do that by Discerning how
[1:50:43] it fits the word in the message of the
[1:50:45] hour always but I was having interaction
[1:50:47] with a sister and and really I was
[1:50:50] observing a conversation just to be
[1:50:52] honest I wasn't an active part of the
[1:50:54] conversation and the thing that struck
[1:50:56] me the most is this is a loving person a
[1:51:00] giving person a person who has a heart
[1:51:03] for other people
[1:51:05] I know that in the natural I know that I
[1:51:09] have observed that I have watched that
[1:51:12] don't ask me if you're the person don't
[1:51:14] ask me if you're the sister
[1:51:17] but she's here this morning
[1:51:20] and in the course of this conversation I
[1:51:24] was struck
[1:51:25] by how quickly
[1:51:28] she would throw someone
[1:51:30] under the bus
[1:51:35] a loving person
[1:51:38] a compassionate person a caring person
[1:51:44] one that I would
[1:51:46] describe and have described as having a
[1:51:50] heart for others
[1:51:52] but in this conversation that I was
[1:51:54] observing it didn't matter who came up
[1:51:58] or what situation came up my you're
[1:52:01] listening
[1:52:02] this must be so close to gossip that
[1:52:04] I've got your attention because you're
[1:52:06] really listening some of you I was
[1:52:09] observing this sister and how quick it
[1:52:12] was that no matter what name came up or
[1:52:15] what situation came up it it meant
[1:52:18] nothing to her
[1:52:20] to sell out someone else
[1:52:24] to blame someone else
[1:52:27] to make fun of someone else
[1:52:31] to almost rejoice
[1:52:36] in their calamity
[1:52:40] it's so grieved to me
[1:52:43] the only thing that shook me out of the
[1:52:46] dream was when the power went off at 4
[1:52:48] a.m this morning for just a few seconds
[1:52:51] and it shook me out of the dream I had a
[1:52:54] very very hard time going back to sleep
[1:52:57] after the dream because I was processing
[1:52:59] it in no way changed my feeling toward
[1:53:03] this precious sister
[1:53:06] I love her
[1:53:08] I honor her
[1:53:10] she is everything I knew her to be a
[1:53:13] loving person
[1:53:15] a generous person
[1:53:18] a a compassionate person
[1:53:22] one who really likes to see other people
[1:53:25] happy
[1:53:27] but in this situation
[1:53:29] no matter what name came up or what
[1:53:32] situation came up
[1:53:33] I just saw this constant throwing
[1:53:36] someone else under the bus
[1:53:38] it's so grieved me
[1:53:41] because I recognized that this is a part
[1:53:45] of our present condition
[1:53:48] as a body
[1:53:51] a woman represents the church
[1:53:55] the first person I ever saw Changed by
[1:53:58] the tent vision
[1:54:00] was my own mother
[1:54:02] now many have tried to interpret that
[1:54:06] as physical
[1:54:08] but remember I told you
[1:54:10] part one was spiritual part two was
[1:54:14] spiritual part three is spiritual
[1:54:17] the change that took place in her life
[1:54:20] in the vision that I had was a deep
[1:54:23] change
[1:54:25] it was a change that was so profound and
[1:54:29] so prolific that it affected every part
[1:54:32] of who she was remember what brother
[1:54:34] random said about women they represent
[1:54:36] what
[1:54:37] the church
[1:54:40] so I knew in that Vision that my mother
[1:54:43] though dear to me and precious and
[1:54:46] believed that she would experience some
[1:54:48] change in her life I knew that she was
[1:54:51] representing something bigger
[1:54:54] than her own physical life are you still
[1:54:56] with me I'll hurry I will hurry when I
[1:54:58] get ready to after a while I'm not ready
[1:55:01] to hurry yet but I will it's coming
[1:55:04] and so in this dream that I had last
[1:55:07] night I knew in my heart
[1:55:09] that this was not only something that
[1:55:12] this person might struggle with from
[1:55:14] time to time but but unfortunately it
[1:55:18] was also a seasonal warning
[1:55:21] for this church body this morning
[1:55:24] that we should be willing
[1:55:28] to throw ourselves under the bus
[1:55:33] all right yes
[1:55:35] yes sir before we would throw someone
[1:55:39] else
[1:55:42] I'm looking back there at Josh Seiler
[1:55:44] and I'm thinking about the sacrifice and
[1:55:47] and Jesse and others who serve in
[1:55:50] whatever capacity they serve
[1:55:53] even even police officers and firemen
[1:55:57] and and and those who serve others what
[1:56:00] kind of a messed up system would we have
[1:56:04] if we were putting people in those
[1:56:06] positions
[1:56:08] who would rather you burn up
[1:56:11] than to risk their lives
[1:56:15] so often these men and women are risking
[1:56:19] their lives throwing themselves
[1:56:22] In Harm's Way
[1:56:24] jumping out of perfectly good airplanes
[1:56:27] so that they can be ready
[1:56:30] if the need arises that that the defense
[1:56:34] of our nation would require such a thing
[1:56:37] you can't do it on the day it's
[1:56:39] necessary you've got to prepare and
[1:56:42] train yourself to be ready for the day
[1:56:44] that it might be God forbid that it ever
[1:56:47] be necessary but just in case it is
[1:56:51] you've got to be ready for it when it
[1:56:53] comes
[1:56:54] and so uh you wouldn't want to be and
[1:56:57] and I won't go into the rest of the the
[1:56:59] dream before that but but you you want
[1:57:02] to know just let me say it this way you
[1:57:04] want to know who you're in the Foxhole
[1:57:06] with
[1:57:09] you don't want to be with somebody that
[1:57:11] would snatch you up by the nip of the
[1:57:13] neck and and wave your head around
[1:57:16] here's the target
[1:57:19] you want somebody who if they saw you
[1:57:22] getting a little high for the whole
[1:57:24] Would You Yank you back down and say you
[1:57:27] big dummy get your head down you're
[1:57:31] gonna make yourself a Target in the rest
[1:57:33] of us as well you want to know that
[1:57:36] you've got somebody who has your back
[1:57:40] you want to know that you've got
[1:57:42] somebody that loves and cherishes your
[1:57:45] life
[1:57:46] whether they like you or not
[1:57:50] you don't have to like your buddy
[1:57:53] you've just got to be committed to help
[1:57:55] saving his life
[1:58:01] now there's some mighty bloody movies
[1:58:04] about war
[1:58:07] I'm not going to name any of them
[1:58:08] because I don't want to encourage
[1:58:09] anybody to go and see it if you're not
[1:58:12] in a person prepared for what what it
[1:58:15] means but I'm I'm always amazed one
[1:58:18] particular movie comes to mind and don't
[1:58:20] call it out and neither will I
[1:58:22] but one comes to mind
[1:58:25] actually two come to mind
[1:58:28] one I might mean no no no don't do that
[1:58:30] don't mention either one
[1:58:32] just give me some water let me have some
[1:58:34] water let me swallow swallow it before I
[1:58:36] spit it out
[1:58:40] two come to mind
[1:58:43] where it was in their
[1:58:46] religious makeup their Church background
[1:58:51] not to fight
[1:58:54] but they find themselves
[1:58:56] drafted into a war
[1:58:59] that they didn't want to be a part of
[1:59:03] and Sergeant York oops
[1:59:07] that's the least bloody that's the less
[1:59:09] bloody of the two
[1:59:13] made up his mind
[1:59:17] I'm here
[1:59:19] I'm going to do my part
[1:59:21] in defending these people
[1:59:24] in the other movies that are made like
[1:59:27] that
[1:59:28] I'm always impressed by the fact
[1:59:31] that not only did soldiers do everything
[1:59:34] they could to keep the other person
[1:59:36] alive when wounded
[1:59:39] they didn't want to leave them there on
[1:59:41] the battlefield
[1:59:44] they're dragging them
[1:59:46] they're carrying them
[1:59:49] they're doing everything they can
[1:59:52] I knew Dave Reaver I don't know if
[1:59:54] anyone ever knew Dave Reaver he was
[1:59:56] Assembly of God preacher I knew him
[1:59:58] pretty well he was wounded hideously
[2:00:03] horrendously in the Vietnam War his a
[2:00:06] phosphorus bomb went off
[2:00:09] close enough to him that it burnt his
[2:00:12] body and melted the flesh off of his
[2:00:14] body and disfigured his face took his
[2:00:17] hand took his ear burned the whole side
[2:00:20] of his face off and and he tells the
[2:00:24] story of laying there in the recovery
[2:00:26] room and watching wives walk in the
[2:00:29] recovery room and taking their wedding
[2:00:31] rings off and laying them on the bed no
[2:00:35] longer committed to marriage by someone
[2:00:37] left so disfigured that's not loyalty
[2:00:41] that's not the kind of wife you want
[2:00:42] brother
[2:00:44] you don't wanna you don't want a wife
[2:00:46] that's only after that because that can
[2:00:49] all pass away
[2:00:50] you you want one that's going to love
[2:00:52] you for the Long Haul
[2:00:54] and I've heard Dave Reaver talking about
[2:00:57] it even over coffee with some friends
[2:00:59] I've heard him talking about the fact
[2:01:02] that he dreaded the moment
[2:01:04] But realize that there was something
[2:01:06] more for his wife and with his wife and
[2:01:09] she just embraced him without a face
[2:01:11] without an ear without a hand and he
[2:01:15] told stories about dragging buddies and
[2:01:18] friends and helping this this is what
[2:01:20] the world does
[2:01:22] this is what the secular Army defending
[2:01:25] our nation does shouldn't it even be
[2:01:28] more so
[2:01:31] [Music]
[2:01:33] in the body of Christ
[2:01:36] I'm not going to spend my sermon this
[2:01:38] morning on that but I want to give you
[2:01:40] the thought because I'll develop it
[2:01:42] later and because it's for us it's for
[2:01:46] us
[2:01:47] we must rather be ready to take the
[2:01:51] guilt
[2:01:53] than to so quickly shovel it off on
[2:01:58] somebody else
[2:01:59] it's part of what Christianity is
[2:02:03] supposed to be it's what the word is
[2:02:06] supposed to produce in us a love for one
[2:02:09] another that you would take a bullet
[2:02:14] for another person in the body of Christ
[2:02:17] not in your clique
[2:02:20] foreign
[2:02:22] not in your comfortable zone of
[2:02:25] fellowship and we all have them
[2:02:28] I have a comfortable zone of Fellowship
[2:02:30] I'm not going to tell you that I don't
[2:02:34] I need to be around people that don't
[2:02:36] make me nervous
[2:02:38] because I live my life as a nervous
[2:02:42] person because of the gift
[2:02:44] and I need if I am just relaxing I need
[2:02:48] to relax
[2:02:49] with somebody that doesn't press those
[2:02:51] buttons
[2:02:53] otherwise
[2:02:55] I couldn't function when I have to stand
[2:02:57] up here or when I have to prepare to
[2:02:59] stand up here surely you understand
[2:03:02] I'm not talking about the fact that we
[2:03:04] don't have we have our little families
[2:03:06] and we have our our I'm not talking
[2:03:08] about that
[2:03:09] I'm talking about are you willing to lay
[2:03:12] it down for somebody who makes you
[2:03:14] nervous
[2:03:16] or someone who you find to be so out
[2:03:19] there
[2:03:20] that you can hardly listen to what they
[2:03:22] have to say
[2:03:24] or someone that you are fighting under a
[2:03:27] spirit of Suspicion against
[2:03:34] Sheila
[2:03:36] pause and think on these things
[2:03:40] would you be willing
[2:03:43] to take a bullet
[2:03:45] would you be willing to shove that
[2:03:47] person down
[2:03:49] risking the fact
[2:03:51] that you might be grossly affected by
[2:03:54] the crossfire
[2:03:55] and spiritually it works just like it
[2:03:57] does in the natural
[2:04:00] When you pray for someone especially
[2:04:03] around a altar of Deliverance like this
[2:04:05] when you pray for someone you might
[2:04:08] ought to know to be prepared
[2:04:10] because what they fight you may now be
[2:04:12] fighting
[2:04:15] that's why I think you should be careful
[2:04:17] who you lay your hands on and what kind
[2:04:19] of authority you claim to take
[2:04:23] because you may invite something into
[2:04:25] your life bigger than what you're
[2:04:27] struggling with on your own and when you
[2:04:29] do it always do it in his name always
[2:04:32] lay hands on someone in the name of the
[2:04:34] Lord Jesus Christ always do it as an act
[2:04:37] of ministry don't ever do it because you
[2:04:40] want somebody to see you
[2:04:41] because if you do you're inviting the
[2:04:44] very war that they're involved in to
[2:04:47] invade your safe Zone
[2:04:49] come on now you can take on battles that
[2:04:52] are not yours to fight
[2:04:54] illegal mercy and showing this
[2:04:57] unsanctified Mercy to people and and and
[2:04:59] and and sometimes we we do things
[2:05:02] because we don't like controversy and we
[2:05:06] back off and sometimes we open ourselves
[2:05:08] up to an internal fight that we don't
[2:05:10] have to have but I want to move on now
[2:05:12] but I want to leave you with this I want
[2:05:14] we have just spent time with our natural
[2:05:16] families and I want to leave you with
[2:05:19] this as we move to something else for
[2:05:21] closing I want you to understand that if
[2:05:24] we can't get there on our own if we
[2:05:27] can't get there on our own get to that
[2:05:30] place where we are busy
[2:05:34] working not to throw other people
[2:05:37] In Harm's Way
[2:05:39] but stand in the way and take a bullet
[2:05:42] for somebody
[2:05:43] if we can't get to that place on our own
[2:05:46] let me just remind you God has a way
[2:05:52] life has a way with God's help of
[2:05:55] getting you to a place
[2:05:58] and that's what I I don't want to say
[2:05:59] fear but that's what I'm concerned about
[2:06:01] in this body
[2:06:03] after coming out of this dream
[2:06:05] we need to be very careful the words
[2:06:08] that come out of our mouth not just on
[2:06:10] the volleyball court not just on the on
[2:06:12] the on the fellowship launch
[2:06:14] but standing outside in our fellowship
[2:06:17] and when we meet in one another's homes
[2:06:18] we need to be very careful about the
[2:06:20] words that we speak about one another
[2:06:22] because God is trying to build an army
[2:06:25] of people that he can trust because 2023
[2:06:28] is going to bring some major changes to
[2:06:30] us spiritually
[2:06:32] it's going to bring some major changes
[2:06:34] to this church and the geography of the
[2:06:36] church it's going to bring some major
[2:06:38] changes to our nation
[2:06:41] the Holy Ghost spoke to us last Sunday
[2:06:43] that the next two years are going to be
[2:06:45] unprecedented in many different ways and
[2:06:49] we want to be prepared for that
[2:06:52] if the only reason why you're on social
[2:06:55] media is to make fun of somebody else's
[2:06:58] life you need another Hobby
[2:07:03] you know I grew up being made fun I know
[2:07:06] I know that you all find me to be very
[2:07:08] normal
[2:07:11] but believe it or not everyone didn't
[2:07:13] think I was normal
[2:07:16] and I grew up being very made fun of in
[2:07:19] public school
[2:07:20] and I had two big buck teeth
[2:07:24] who you did too Jennifer
[2:07:28] big buck teeth
[2:07:31] and I looked like my nickname
[2:07:35] beaver
[2:07:37] most of the time that did I don't want
[2:07:39] you to feel sorry for me
[2:07:42] boy I just love you folks
[2:07:45] some of you were just oh my pastor was
[2:07:50] made fun of it gets much worse than that
[2:07:54] you you don't mind it from everybody
[2:07:59] but you don't expect it from everybody
[2:08:03] you expect it from The Jealous Ones you
[2:08:06] expected from your enemy but you don't
[2:08:09] expect it
[2:08:13] from your friends
[2:08:16] from your brothers and sisters in Christ
[2:08:19] I wouldn't expect that any of you all
[2:08:21] would call me beaver
[2:08:23] and some of you knew me when my when I
[2:08:26] when I still had some pretty buck teeth
[2:08:30] I I mean I was a grown man with children
[2:08:32] before I did anything to my teeth and
[2:08:35] that's a long story
[2:08:36] my dad refused to pay for braces my mom
[2:08:39] couldn't afford it it wasn't covered
[2:08:41] under insurance
[2:08:43] and so I grew up with with a very gray
[2:08:46] teeth also because of a tetracycline
[2:08:49] stains
[2:08:51] and
[2:08:53] I rarely smiled
[2:08:56] when I was a boy preacher my mom
[2:08:59] wouldn't let me have a decent haircut
[2:09:00] because she had an idea of what a
[2:09:02] haircut was supposed to look like and
[2:09:04] that was like a bowl right on top of my
[2:09:05] head
[2:09:07] and I had bangs that come down there
[2:09:09] like that and I was kind of ugly I'll
[2:09:11] just be honest
[2:09:13] you expect
[2:09:17] but you don't expect your brothers and
[2:09:20] sisters in Christ
[2:09:28] I think we're getting a little too much
[2:09:30] Liberty
[2:09:31] with our fun
[2:09:34] I believe that the Holy Ghost is calling
[2:09:37] this body
[2:09:39] to a little more careful treatment
[2:09:43] of one another
[2:09:45] the season is changing
[2:09:48] and it may mean that we have to do some
[2:09:51] changing with it
[2:09:57] it never occurred to me uh
[2:10:00] Jennifer and and Josiah I did get a
[2:10:03] laugh
[2:10:04] you you when Jennifer sent me the
[2:10:06] picture she said I want to give you a
[2:10:08] good laugh I did get a laugh but I loved
[2:10:10] it
[2:10:13] it was
[2:10:16] I said nobody else
[2:10:20] that's what I said nobody else
[2:10:24] nobody else is going to dress up like a
[2:10:27] pilgrim and an Indian
[2:10:31] and not only go and surprise their
[2:10:34] family
[2:10:35] but go to the coffee shop like that
[2:10:43] come on now
[2:10:47] I never I know you wouldn't
[2:10:51] but they would
[2:10:53] and they did
[2:10:55] and I love that they did
[2:10:59] you understand I love it when I say love
[2:11:02] I mean it I love that they did
[2:11:07] because to me it's a statement that says
[2:11:10] we're quirky
[2:11:15] I'm quirky
[2:11:16] did you all take that you didn't take
[2:11:18] that wrong did you and I'm not ashamed
[2:11:22] amen I I'm brave
[2:11:25] and I'm not ashamed
[2:11:29] well David didn't actually didn't do
[2:11:31] that
[2:11:35] what's wrong with y'all
[2:11:40] you understand
[2:11:42] this constant comparing ourselves to
[2:11:45] each other and expecting that we all
[2:11:48] dance the same way up here
[2:11:52] or worship the same way raise our hands
[2:11:57] the same way say Amen the same way come
[2:11:59] on now
[2:12:01] there's plenty of room in the body
[2:12:06] for you to be you
[2:12:08] and still be gods
[2:12:13] I I fully stand by the things I said
[2:12:16] last week some people say they want
[2:12:18] friends
[2:12:20] but they go around seeing how many
[2:12:22] people they can insult
[2:12:27] foreign
[2:12:30] to the sister who said to my mom to the
[2:12:33] young sister who said to my mom one time
[2:12:36] I think your purse is gaudy
[2:12:43] I am amazed that you developed such a
[2:12:46] sweet friendship
[2:12:48] with my mother
[2:12:50] because that is not the way you make
[2:12:52] friends
[2:13:00] with my mama
[2:13:02] especially
[2:13:04] does anybody understand
[2:13:07] I don't care whether you like it or not
[2:13:09] she said
[2:13:11] you don't have any taste anyway
[2:13:17] but they became sweet friends if you
[2:13:20] don't know who it was I'm not telling
[2:13:23] but you wonder sometime
[2:13:26] when you say things like that someone
[2:13:28] else comes to my mind who would go up to
[2:13:31] people and say
[2:13:33] you're wearing that
[2:13:35] young people standing up for the church
[2:13:37] you're wearing that
[2:13:41] do you think that is a way to bind
[2:13:44] yourself together as a group of young
[2:13:46] people
[2:13:51] we learn to tolerate each other's sense
[2:13:53] of fashion
[2:13:55] and we learn to tolerate the fact that
[2:13:57] some people have none
[2:14:01] somebody said well brother Branham
[2:14:03] didn't care about that you know he said
[2:14:05] I don't care if my you know slacks were
[2:14:08] striped and my coat is checking well he
[2:14:10] may not have cared but sister me to
[2:14:12] cared because I didn't see him looking
[2:14:13] like that in the pulpit
[2:14:16] that's right
[2:14:17] so if you're challenged that way you get
[2:14:20] as close as you can to somebody that's
[2:14:21] not
[2:14:23] but this is not a fashion show
[2:14:26] this is not a competition this is a body
[2:14:30] and a family and there's always an uncle
[2:14:33] and there's always a cousin and there's
[2:14:36] always somebody that does marches to the
[2:14:39] beat of Their Own Drum but but we don't
[2:14:41] cut them out of our natural families
[2:14:44] neither can we cut them out of our
[2:14:47] spiritual families if we can learn to
[2:14:50] love one another and embrace one another
[2:14:52] and celebrate one another and take a
[2:14:56] bullet for one another and throw
[2:14:58] ourselves in front of the bus for
[2:15:01] somebody else's life to be protected
[2:15:03] then God has a way he has a way he has a
[2:15:07] way of teaching us how to respect and
[2:15:10] honor one another
[2:15:11] and none of us are going to like it
[2:15:18] so we all have to take a checkup
[2:15:22] I've always said that poking is my love
[2:15:25] language
[2:15:27] my wife has always spoken up and said
[2:15:29] it's not mine
[2:15:33] but when I'm preaching to you I'm also
[2:15:36] preaching to myself where we need to
[2:15:39] take an inventory
[2:15:42] because you look around this room
[2:15:45] this eclectic eccentric room full of
[2:15:48] people
[2:15:52] you might say never mind I won't say it
[2:15:58] you know the world doesn't even know
[2:16:00] what to call you
[2:16:05] someone just recently was asked are you
[2:16:07] Catholic or Christian at least they knew
[2:16:09] the difference
[2:16:15] we often get asked are you Amish or
[2:16:17] Mennonite
[2:16:19] somebody asked you if we were part of
[2:16:21] the pilgrims which by the way is no
[2:16:23] longer a religious order
[2:16:28] are you one of those skirt people well
[2:16:30] I'm not particularly but my wife is
[2:16:34] we we have enough double stairs
[2:16:39] I have sisters in this church who tell
[2:16:41] me by the time they loaded up all their
[2:16:43] children in the buggy and go to Walmart
[2:16:45] that they turn every head in the
[2:16:47] building
[2:16:48] because we're living in a Society now
[2:16:51] that has come from 15 children in a
[2:16:54] family to to uh 2.5
[2:16:58] and so if someone's got four children or
[2:17:00] five children in a buggy going through
[2:17:03] Walmart
[2:17:04] they look like the Duggars
[2:17:07] and the world looks at them that way
[2:17:09] you've got enough folks
[2:17:11] you've got enough the world looks at you
[2:17:13] like you're crazy already we need to
[2:17:16] stop looking at one another like that
[2:17:20] you'd be surprised how far love can go
[2:17:22] in a body like this
[2:17:24] come on you know that little child that
[2:17:26] gets on your nerves
[2:17:31] well some of them are married now
[2:17:35] and we'll have children of Their Own
[2:17:38] and you know what made a difference for
[2:17:40] them
[2:17:43] a little extra love
[2:17:46] it doesn't mean that Mama's not doing a
[2:17:48] good job it doesn't mean that daddy's
[2:17:50] not doing a good job it simply means
[2:17:53] that there are certain children with
[2:17:54] certain personality types that crave
[2:17:57] love from whoever they can get it from
[2:17:59] that's why they have to be guarded the
[2:18:01] most that's why they have to be watched
[2:18:03] the most in public that's why they can't
[2:18:05] go to the bathroom by themselves hear me
[2:18:08] because they're just made that way
[2:18:11] they're fighting something perhaps
[2:18:13] dealing with something in their DNA even
[2:18:17] fighting to overcome something in their
[2:18:19] life that they don't even understand
[2:18:21] reaching out for attention
[2:18:25] and they'll run you slap crazy
[2:18:28] if you're not used to a child like that
[2:18:31] but let me encourage you there's a way
[2:18:33] to fix this
[2:18:35] pull that child close
[2:18:40] bring them a snack
[2:18:44] instead of having this at boy I'm really
[2:18:47] I know that this is whoa this is right
[2:18:50] down the nitty-gritty instead of saying
[2:18:52] I can't feed the whole church
[2:18:58] like some of you mamas have done
[2:19:06] try buying it at Sam's
[2:19:11] try bringing a bigger bag
[2:19:15] be like April who brought a big old box
[2:19:18] of
[2:19:19] ice cream sandwiches from Sam's one of
[2:19:24] the Sunday afternoons and she
[2:19:26] immediately became the most popular
[2:19:27] woman in the church
[2:19:29] kids that have never even said hi to her
[2:19:31] before were right up under her weren't
[2:19:34] they they were just a coming and I I'm a
[2:19:36] worry wart when it comes to stuff like
[2:19:38] that and I'm sitting over there thinking
[2:19:40] oh my she's going to run out and
[2:19:42] somebody ain't gonna get one and
[2:19:45] and she's just handing around
[2:19:47] come on folks you'll never outgive God
[2:19:51] you give to the household of faith you
[2:19:54] share with somebody
[2:19:56] you some of you folks will take your
[2:19:58] used clothes down and give them the good
[2:20:00] will before you would take the time to
[2:20:03] try to find someone in the church that
[2:20:04] needs some shame on you
[2:20:08] the Bible said we should be particularly
[2:20:10] kind to the household of faith
[2:20:14] if you've got a skirt don't take it the
[2:20:16] Salvation Army I guarantee you if you've
[2:20:19] got a skirt somebody in here not me but
[2:20:23] somebody in here could get it on
[2:20:25] all right come on we ought to be
[2:20:27] fighting to take care of one another why
[2:20:30] are you preaching such a thing as this
[2:20:32] because there may be a time that we
[2:20:34] can't run to Dillard's
[2:20:38] there may be a time that Amazon won't
[2:20:40] have us
[2:20:43] coming down the river
[2:20:46] we better learn
[2:20:49] unless it don't think you need
[2:20:50] fellowship with the rest of this body
[2:20:53] I want you to know you make need us one
[2:20:56] day
[2:20:59] somebody said I got my family that's all
[2:21:02] I want you may find out brother sister
[2:21:04] that you need this body one day
[2:21:07] you better practice getting along with
[2:21:09] us while you can I wish somebody would
[2:21:11] help me this morning somebody said are
[2:21:13] you preaching the gospel or just airing
[2:21:15] the dirty laundry a little bit of both
[2:21:18] because I heard the Lord amen amen and
[2:21:22] when he told us to build this church he
[2:21:24] said I want you to take this as a
[2:21:27] mandate build stronger families that's
[2:21:31] what we're trying to do this morning
[2:21:32] build stronger family do you know when
[2:21:35] they interview people
[2:21:37] who are starting to church
[2:21:40] Across the Nation and they interview
[2:21:43] them and they say to them why are you
[2:21:45] coming to church why are have you
[2:21:48] decided to start coming to church very
[2:21:51] few of them say I want to give my life
[2:21:52] to the Lord very few of them say I'm
[2:21:55] tired of being a sinner and I'm ready to
[2:21:57] get saved do you know what most of them
[2:22:00] say I want a community
[2:22:03] right
[2:22:05] I'm looking for a place to raise my
[2:22:07] children with those who have have like
[2:22:10] ideals and morals I want a community I
[2:22:16] want a people I want I want to plug in
[2:22:18] to something that's bigger than I am
[2:22:21] [Applause]
[2:22:23] I don't like sports
[2:22:27] although I did stream a little of the
[2:22:29] iron bowl full disclosure
[2:22:31] I did stream a little of the Iron Bowl
[2:22:33] on my iPad for what I don't know
[2:22:35] what a waste of time
[2:22:39] but I'm not a sports fan
[2:22:43] how in the world I ended up with
[2:22:45] Benjamin and Joshua in my family
[2:22:49] if they didn't favor me I would think
[2:22:51] they came from somebody else
[2:22:56] not not really that's really not the
[2:22:58] thing to say on the eve of your 25th
[2:23:00] wedding anniversary
[2:23:15] although I have seen my wife run through
[2:23:18] the house when the UPS truck comes I
[2:23:20] have
[2:23:25] and I said to her honey you don't have
[2:23:28] to meet him at the door
[2:23:31] it had nothing to do with the delivery
[2:23:34] person it had everything to do with what
[2:23:35] was in the box
[2:23:39] where were we
[2:23:41] but my boys learned something in their
[2:23:43] Sports activity
[2:23:46] that church people can learn
[2:23:49] they learn what it means to be a team
[2:23:54] now may they bring some of that to
[2:23:55] church with them I hope so
[2:23:58] because we need that in this body
[2:24:01] we're in this together
[2:24:07] you know you people that have been
[2:24:09] transplanted here don't make fun of the
[2:24:11] way we talk in the south
[2:24:14] I don't appreciate it
[2:24:20] because this happens to be where God
[2:24:22] chose
[2:24:24] to bring you
[2:24:26] I don't make fun of brother branham's
[2:24:28] hates and ain'ts
[2:24:31] cause at least I know what he meant
[2:24:35] I listen to people trying to be so
[2:24:37] educated in their delivery that you
[2:24:39] don't even know what they're saying the
[2:24:41] one thing you'll never accuse brother
[2:24:43] random of being is preaching over the
[2:24:44] people's heads
[2:24:46] the Bible said Jesus came and his
[2:24:48] message was so profound and so simple
[2:24:51] and so precious that both the religious
[2:24:54] Scholars and the common prostitute
[2:24:57] [Music]
[2:24:59] understood what he meant
[2:25:02] challenged by his words
[2:25:05] doing things at the right time I'm back
[2:25:09] to the word now it's crucial it's 115
[2:25:11] give me 15 more minutes
[2:25:16] he created seasons
[2:25:18] it's no big prophetic thing to say
[2:25:21] change is on the way because change is
[2:25:24] always
[2:25:25] on the way
[2:25:27] God is not satisfied leaving us the way
[2:25:30] we he found us
[2:25:33] very little stays the same in this life
[2:25:37] it's not necessarily change that we
[2:25:40] don't like
[2:25:41] in fact some of us often cry out to God
[2:25:44] for change let me see your hand
[2:25:47] if you find yourself crying out to God
[2:25:49] for change so it's not change that you
[2:25:52] fear
[2:25:54] most of the time it's a dread and a fear
[2:25:58] of the unknown
[2:26:00] leaving behind the familiar
[2:26:04] can stress us
[2:26:07] not knowing what the next season will
[2:26:10] look like and how change will affect our
[2:26:13] lives our families our homes our jobs
[2:26:17] but I want to tell you in the name of
[2:26:18] the Lord the season that you are in
[2:26:21] right now is about to change
[2:26:25] I'm speaking corporately but if you dare
[2:26:29] have faith
[2:26:30] you can change your personal season as
[2:26:33] well
[2:26:34] something's coming
[2:26:36] something we've been waiting on a long
[2:26:38] time something we've been praying for
[2:26:41] something that was prophesied a
[2:26:44] generation ago and you better be ready
[2:26:49] when it gets here
[2:26:51] if we can't learn to get along
[2:26:55] we'll never be prepared
[2:26:58] for what is ahead
[2:27:03] we need to quit making excuses for our
[2:27:06] Lacks
[2:27:08] and we need to ask for Grace
[2:27:11] to grow up into what God is calling us
[2:27:13] to be if you believe that say Amen
[2:27:16] something powerful is coming and you're
[2:27:18] going to want to be ready for it when it
[2:27:20] comes
[2:27:21] Isaiah 54 17 says no weapon that is
[2:27:26] formed against thee shall prosper
[2:27:30] you can't feel
[2:27:31] and every tongue that shall rise against
[2:27:36] thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn
[2:27:40] this is the heritage of the Servants of
[2:27:43] the Lord and their righteousnesses of me
[2:27:45] saith the Lord I want my hair I want my
[2:27:48] heritage
[2:27:49] I want my inheritance
[2:27:51] my inheritance is to live a life so that
[2:27:55] no weapon formed against me can prosper
[2:27:58] and every tongue that rises to condemn
[2:28:00] me in judgment God himself will condemn
[2:28:04] that's my Heritage that's my inheritance
[2:28:06] that's my promise I don't need to spend
[2:28:09] time worrying about what they're saying
[2:28:11] out there about me or you you need to
[2:28:13] worry about whether or not you're
[2:28:15] walking in the righteousness of the Lord
[2:28:17] it doesn't matter what you've been
[2:28:19] fighting against
[2:28:21] you have authority in the name of Jesus
[2:28:23] Christ to cause that thing to fall it
[2:28:27] doesn't matter who's been saying what
[2:28:29] God desires to come to your defense in
[2:28:33] this next season how many of you are
[2:28:35] ready for the Lord to stand up for you
[2:28:37] then you must be ready today to stand up
[2:28:41] for him
[2:28:49] God said every tongue that rises against
[2:28:51] you I will condemn it
[2:28:54] as a body we're about to go through
[2:28:56] another season of Change A change is
[2:28:58] coming and yet
[2:29:00] A Change Is Here
[2:29:03] something you're trying to do before but
[2:29:05] couldn't do in your own power something
[2:29:07] that you've been racking your brain over
[2:29:09] something that you've been praying about
[2:29:10] a wall that you couldn't get over in the
[2:29:13] past a situation that you've not been
[2:29:15] able to change no matter how hard you
[2:29:17] have tried the problem that just won't
[2:29:20] go away
[2:29:22] the impossibility that has held back the
[2:29:25] potential in your life and your walk
[2:29:27] with God it's about to become possible
[2:29:30] if you will step up and take what's
[2:29:33] yours
[2:29:35] the impossibility it's a new season
[2:29:39] and if you'll embrace it even celebrate
[2:29:41] it
[2:29:42] you'll see the victory of your Victor
[2:29:47] you'll see the victory of your Victor
[2:29:49] isn't it about time you find yourself in
[2:29:52] the season that God wants you to be in
[2:29:55] how many of you are tired of running
[2:29:56] late
[2:29:58] I'm going to break this down for some of
[2:30:00] us
[2:30:02] maybe you've been trying to get a suntan
[2:30:06] in the midst of winter
[2:30:09] maybe you've been trying to shovel snow
[2:30:12] in the middle of the summer
[2:30:15] then you're in the wrong season
[2:30:17] anybody hear a man
[2:30:19] you've been working too hard at
[2:30:20] something that wasn't in God's timing
[2:30:22] maybe you're doing the right labor but
[2:30:25] in the wrong season
[2:30:28] there is a time to plant
[2:30:31] there's a time to pluck up what is
[2:30:33] planted
[2:30:34] if you're plucking up in a season of
[2:30:37] planting you're not in God's proper
[2:30:40] season
[2:30:42] if you're trying to plant when it's
[2:30:44] harvest time you're not going to produce
[2:30:47] anything
[2:30:49] because winter is going to steal your
[2:30:51] Harvest from you if you're busy digging
[2:30:53] in the dirt when it's time to pick the
[2:30:55] fruit of your Harvest you're going to
[2:30:57] miss out on a tremendous blessing in
[2:30:59] your life you must stay in step with the
[2:31:01] Holy Ghost you must stay in step with
[2:31:04] the word you must stay in step with the
[2:31:07] spirit the spirit will keep you in the
[2:31:09] right season of the Lord
[2:31:12] no wonder we get discouraged when we're
[2:31:14] working so hard but we see such little
[2:31:16] result if you are doing all you know to
[2:31:19] do
[2:31:20] and you are seeing no fruit
[2:31:26] there is a reason for that
[2:31:30] you need to now ask yourself am I doing
[2:31:33] all the right things
[2:31:36] but in the wrong season
[2:31:39] because if you'll just wait for the
[2:31:40] season to change
[2:31:42] and go right back into doing all the
[2:31:44] right things that you know to do in the
[2:31:46] right season God will give you the
[2:31:48] Harvest that you're after
[2:31:50] don't quit paying your tithe because
[2:31:52] you're because you're having a little
[2:31:54] bit of a struggle waiting for a more
[2:31:56] convenient time to pay your tithe look
[2:31:59] folks I don't say that much about paying
[2:32:01] cards
[2:32:03] so don't you get all twisted up in here
[2:32:06] the Bible said if you don't pay your
[2:32:08] tithe you're a thief and a robber if you
[2:32:11] think God's going to bless a thief and a
[2:32:12] robber you've missed the whole
[2:32:14] interpretation of the word the whole
[2:32:16] Bible tells us God's about honesty and
[2:32:18] integrity and if you're one of those who
[2:32:20] says I can't afford to pay my tithe you
[2:32:23] don't even understand the concept of
[2:32:25] sowing and reaping because the real
[2:32:27] truth is you can't afford not to
[2:32:30] I'm gonna pay my tithe if the light bill
[2:32:32] isn't paid that's me that's me I'm not
[2:32:35] telling you to do it
[2:32:37] because I have learned that if I prove
[2:32:40] God
[2:32:42] and put God to the test
[2:32:45] he will always
[2:32:47] somebody said I'm just going to keep
[2:32:48] back this little portion this month
[2:32:50] because I'm having a hard time I
[2:32:52] wouldn't do I don't know who I'm
[2:32:54] preaching to because I don't preach this
[2:32:57] often but I wouldn't do it if I were you
[2:33:01] come on
[2:33:02] I'd find a way to round mine up instead
[2:33:05] of rounding it down I'd find a way to
[2:33:07] give God more than what he required I do
[2:33:10] what brother Branham told us to do don't
[2:33:12] just pay your tithe and think you've
[2:33:13] done God a service
[2:33:15] you put an offering in there it doesn't
[2:33:17] have to be a big one you put a little
[2:33:19] fat on top of that and say now Lord I've
[2:33:21] given you what belongs to you and I'm
[2:33:23] sharing with you what was mine and I'm
[2:33:26] asking you to perform your word in my
[2:33:28] life well I've been doing that and I
[2:33:30] hadn't been seeing the Harvest keep
[2:33:31] doing it
[2:33:33] because there are certain things that
[2:33:36] you don't have to wait on a season to do
[2:33:38] because any time is the right time to
[2:33:41] praise the Lord anytime is the right
[2:33:43] time to give God what belongs to him
[2:33:45] anybody with me
[2:33:50] you've been doing everything you know to
[2:33:52] do but in the wrong season perhaps and
[2:33:53] God is about to bring your life into
[2:33:55] alignment with the season that he wants
[2:33:57] you to be in
[2:34:00] are you ready for change
[2:34:03] I don't really like change
[2:34:06] but we need to know that change comes
[2:34:09] and Seasons come and go whether we want
[2:34:12] them or not
[2:34:13] I won't change I want God to help me
[2:34:16] change some things about me
[2:34:18] let me say that again I want God to help
[2:34:21] me change some things about me did you
[2:34:23] notice I didn't say what church says
[2:34:25] Church says I want God to change some
[2:34:28] things in me
[2:34:30] that's not what I said
[2:34:32] I said I want God to help me change some
[2:34:35] things about me
[2:34:37] do you understand that's how it works
[2:34:40] I know God has moved like this for some
[2:34:43] people but God's not obligated to move
[2:34:44] like this for some people when they say
[2:34:46] things like this now Lord I want you to
[2:34:49] take this desire for alcohol away
[2:34:54] I know God has moved for some people
[2:34:56] like that but not too many that I know
[2:34:58] of because that's not how God's
[2:35:00] obligated himself in the word
[2:35:02] he didn't give you the desire for that
[2:35:04] that didn't come from God
[2:35:06] that came from your own ugly
[2:35:08] associations
[2:35:10] that came from your own Rebellion that
[2:35:12] came from your own choices
[2:35:14] my old granny used to say it's not the
[2:35:16] it's not the first pint
[2:35:20] that makes an alcoholic it's a first
[2:35:22] drop
[2:35:23] you make up your mind I'm staying away
[2:35:25] from that because I've never seen
[2:35:27] anything good I don't know who I'm
[2:35:29] talking to
[2:35:31] me maybe somebody out there but I've
[2:35:34] never seen any good come out of that
[2:35:41] you need a buzz to get down on the floor
[2:35:43] and play with your children that'll buzz
[2:35:45] you
[2:35:47] okay
[2:35:49] find you something in life that you can
[2:35:51] get some enjoyment out of and run to
[2:35:54] that
[2:35:57] well I don't think smoking is all that
[2:35:59] bad and vaping and I read an article
[2:36:01] this week that came up in my feed that
[2:36:04] says these people who are trading their
[2:36:05] cigarettes for Vapes thinking that
[2:36:08] they're doing something more healthy or
[2:36:10] actually doing something worse
[2:36:16] because they're causing more damage to
[2:36:18] their lungs
[2:36:21] one of the chemicals in the in the Vape
[2:36:24] is something that you can swallow in it
[2:36:27] do you no harm
[2:36:29] but inhaling it in your lungs destroys
[2:36:32] your lungs
[2:36:34] so your body design if you were drinking
[2:36:37] it
[2:36:38] to let that chemical go right through
[2:36:40] you
[2:36:41] but it was not your your lungs were not
[2:36:44] created to inhale that into your lung
[2:36:47] you all do understand that what you
[2:36:49] inhale in your lungs what you inhale
[2:36:51] goes to your lungs and you've got to
[2:36:54] have your lungs anybody in here know you
[2:36:56] got to have your lungs
[2:37:00] somebody said that don't matter and you
[2:37:03] know
[2:37:04] I grew up with a Baptist granny that
[2:37:06] dipped snuff
[2:37:08] snuff
[2:37:10] filthy
[2:37:13] filthy
[2:37:14] I don't know how many times I kicked her
[2:37:17] spit can over her lady if you'd have
[2:37:21] seen her you would have thought she was
[2:37:23] a real lady
[2:37:26] always presented herself that way but
[2:37:29] when she was young she got a hold of
[2:37:31] that and it got a hold of her
[2:37:35] and she'd Slide the spit cup up under
[2:37:38] the edge of the chair or the edge of the
[2:37:39] couch because she certainly didn't want
[2:37:41] anybody to know and as a kid I don't
[2:37:43] know how many times I didn't see it and
[2:37:45] kicked it over and then they made me
[2:37:47] clean it up
[2:37:49] that old thick black looking syrup that
[2:37:52] runs out of that stuff
[2:37:55] and people putting chewing tobacco in
[2:37:58] their mouth caused this tongue cancer
[2:38:00] and cheek cancer and all kinds of things
[2:38:03] like that and it used to be popular to
[2:38:05] go around with a with a round circle my
[2:38:08] kids come along and first time I saw
[2:38:11] them with one of them round uh uh uh
[2:38:14] bubble gum things in the back of their I
[2:38:16] said get that out of your pocket
[2:38:21] well it's bubble gum I don't care what
[2:38:23] it is
[2:38:25] people used to love boys I went to
[2:38:27] school with they used to love to have
[2:38:29] that round worn out circle on the back
[2:38:32] of their pocket where they took their
[2:38:34] skull can around filthy mess
[2:38:38] and people come along and say those
[2:38:40] things don't matter I read this week
[2:38:42] where brother Branham said your habits
[2:38:44] are unclean spirits and you'll not get
[2:38:47] by God with them somebody said are you
[2:38:49] condemning us not at all oh I'm telling
[2:38:53] you you're living below who you were
[2:38:56] created to be
[2:38:57] you don't have to
[2:39:00] have to live yourself to that stuff
[2:39:03] you don't have to it doesn't have to own
[2:39:06] you you can own it
[2:39:09] maybe you're not praying the right way
[2:39:12] maybe you're praying on God to take the
[2:39:14] desire for it from you and you need to
[2:39:16] be praying God help me to learn how to
[2:39:18] change my life
[2:39:20] so that I don't yield to all of these
[2:39:23] things
[2:39:24] you know the answer for some people is
[2:39:27] quit staying by yourself all the time
[2:39:30] amen get where there's people
[2:39:35] I can get really nitty-gritty
[2:39:37] if you need me to
[2:39:42] there's just a certain struggle that
[2:39:44] that people have in life they don't need
[2:39:46] to be alone
[2:39:47] they don't need to be where they can get
[2:39:49] their phone off by their self
[2:39:51] anybody with me
[2:39:55] you're not going to sit down in front of
[2:39:56] your family and watch filth
[2:39:58] oh
[2:39:59] you wait until you're off somewhere
[2:40:02] people spending inordinate amount of
[2:40:05] time in the potty
[2:40:08] because they're so addicted to the filth
[2:40:10] on their phone and they don't want to do
[2:40:12] it get out of there get in there you're
[2:40:14] really going to tell us how to go to the
[2:40:15] bathroom I am
[2:40:23] in the opportunity
[2:40:25] to talk to you
[2:40:28] ask God to give you the grace that you
[2:40:31] need to change
[2:40:36] would you think that people come here to
[2:40:38] church and catch up on the social media
[2:40:40] in the bathroom
[2:40:43] what is wrong with
[2:40:46] folk they're not ready for the season
[2:40:48] they're in right now they're certainly
[2:40:50] not ready for the next season that's
[2:40:52] coming musicians are coming
[2:41:08] foreign
[2:41:28] God wants to help us
[2:41:34] God will help you
[2:41:36] when you can't art when you absolutely
[2:41:39] cannot help yourself
[2:41:44] but what God wants to do
[2:41:47] is strengthen you
[2:41:49] so that you can make a difference
[2:41:52] in your own desires in your own life
[2:41:59] I'm not going to miss out on my family
[2:42:03] for a habit
[2:42:07] I'm not going to miss out on my
[2:42:09] grandchildren
[2:42:11] for a habit I don't have any now but I
[2:42:13] will
[2:42:18] I'm not going to I'm not going to let my
[2:42:21] life be so controlled
[2:42:24] that I miss out because when you get to
[2:42:26] where I am in life and you start 25
[2:42:29] years folks I don't want to wax
[2:42:32] sentimental
[2:42:33] but it's like
[2:42:39] any of you remember being in the
[2:42:42] in the hospital
[2:42:45] there were 50 people from this church in
[2:42:47] the hospital waiting room when Benjamin
[2:42:50] was born
[2:42:51] one year after my wife and I married
[2:42:56] and it seems like it was yesterday
[2:43:03] 25 years ago tomorrow brother
[2:43:08] Daryl fecto and brother
[2:43:11] Andrews larti and brother Wesley Greeley
[2:43:15] we're standing there in the old church
[2:43:18] in Columbus
[2:43:21] my wife and I were exchanging our vows
[2:43:25] and it felt like life was beginning
[2:43:30] in 25 years have come and gone so
[2:43:34] quickly
[2:43:37] we didn't marry early in life we married
[2:43:40] a little bit later in life and I am not
[2:43:43] insisting that that is the way it has to
[2:43:46] be
[2:43:48] but I will tell you this
[2:43:53] what you're looking for
[2:43:56] as for a companion in life certainly
[2:44:00] changes
[2:44:02] as you mature
[2:44:09] and all you can do a lot of us all we
[2:44:11] can do is say thank God he didn't give
[2:44:14] me what I wanted at the time
[2:44:17] he let me grow until my desires and my
[2:44:21] thoughts and my what I was looking for
[2:44:23] begin to change in life because all I
[2:44:26] really wanted many things we could talk
[2:44:28] about I wanted in a companion but all I
[2:44:31] really wanted was somebody that would
[2:44:32] love me and stay with me
[2:44:34] through thick and thin
[2:44:36] who would love God
[2:44:40] but I was looking for somebody that was
[2:44:42] in it for the Long Haul
[2:44:47] the things that that I thought were so
[2:44:50] important you know I had my list I don't
[2:44:53] know why
[2:44:54] somebody that looks like me ought not to
[2:44:56] be so picky
[2:44:58] and I'd like to tell some of you folks
[2:45:00] the same thing
[2:45:07] everybody thinks we're all such a prize
[2:45:10] so we get so picky and then life passes
[2:45:14] Us by
[2:45:17] I have a friend
[2:45:19] up the road there
[2:45:21] who's sick in his 60s uh
[2:45:25] in Ohio I'll say that so no one
[2:45:27] misunderstands
[2:45:29] and he had such a list
[2:45:37] I just had to tell him one day I said
[2:45:39] look you better just ask God to give you
[2:45:41] anybody
[2:45:46] yes to anybody that God will give you'll
[2:45:48] be good
[2:45:49] I know you're just mad at me for saying
[2:45:51] so but it's right
[2:45:52] he said I want a piano player I did too
[2:45:55] I want to piano player my wife can
[2:45:57] barely run the radio
[2:46:00] she can do most anything she wants to do
[2:46:03] but she has got a fancy stereo on her
[2:46:05] car that she still does not have set up
[2:46:07] right
[2:46:09] I've been riding with her lately she
[2:46:11] don't even have her phone synced in good
[2:46:13] right with her car
[2:46:18] and I was trying to help her
[2:46:21] and I'm about as challenged as anybody
[2:46:25] I wanted a piano player and I wanted to
[2:46:27] say this brother you know what this
[2:46:29] brother told me he said I don't want a
[2:46:31] wife that's ever played any kind of
[2:46:33] sports
[2:46:38] I said well what's that got to do with
[2:46:40] the prosity in China he said and I don't
[2:46:43] want a woman that's ever wore a t-shirt
[2:46:47] because he had strong convictions about
[2:46:49] women women wearing t-shirts
[2:46:53] and I
[2:46:55] he's still alone and bald-headed and
[2:47:02] can somebody tell me what that's got to
[2:47:04] do with the Long Haul
[2:47:07] you better say God give me the person
[2:47:09] that he wants me to have I tell you
[2:47:12] Josiah you you're you and you and
[2:47:15] Jennifer blessed I don't know if he was
[2:47:18] praying Lord give me somebody that'll
[2:47:19] wear an Indian costume on Thanksgiving
[2:47:30] but he did it
[2:47:36] Lord of Mercy
[2:47:39] yo here brother Jerry Lord of Mercy
[2:47:42] Lord of Mercy
[2:47:45] we shouldn't get so worked up
[2:47:50] but when you do get one you better know
[2:47:53] this she's yours
[2:47:56] for life
[2:48:00] if you've got any questions to ask you
[2:48:03] better ask them before you say I do
[2:48:10] because you folks that have come back
[2:48:12] later around this message have come back
[2:48:15] later and said I didn't know so that you
[2:48:18] could put your wives away and marry
[2:48:20] another
[2:48:21] I don't have to tell you what brother
[2:48:23] Brandon said I'll tell you what the
[2:48:24] Bible said it was not so from the
[2:48:27] beginning
[2:48:31] it's not that hard to get it right
[2:48:34] if you put it in God's hands let's do
[2:48:38] that
[2:48:39] it's not so hard to love one another
[2:48:42] and fight for one another
[2:48:45] if you put it in God's hands let's stand
[2:48:47] he will help us
[2:48:50] boy this is something else this this
[2:48:53] will go down we better strike this from
[2:48:55] all the records and
[2:48:58] we better just pretend as though this
[2:49:00] Sunday was for us and nobody else
[2:49:06] wasn't because I didn't have anything
[2:49:08] good to say
[2:49:09] I just must have not got to it
[2:49:16] and now they're preaching from the pews
[2:49:33] foreign
[2:49:38] that's what it's about
[2:49:40] see it's all right in the laughing at
[2:49:42] each other in the right spirit
[2:49:48] but not in the wrong spirit

[2:59:57] and give us strength to make right
[3:00:00] choices to choose what is right over
