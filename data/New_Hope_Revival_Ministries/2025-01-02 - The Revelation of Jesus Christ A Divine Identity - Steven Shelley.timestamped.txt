[0:00] For unto us a child is born unto us a
[0:04] son is given and the
[0:07] government shall be
[0:09] upon his shoulder and his name Shall be
[0:15] Called who is the son Jesus Yeshua our
[0:18] Messiah what is his name to be called
[0:23] wonderful counselor
[0:27] yes what's the next the the Mighty God
[0:30] is Jesus the Mighty God is Jesus the
[0:33] Mighty God is he the Mighty God the
[0:38] listen to what else he is he's not only
[0:40] the
[0:41] son he is the
[0:44] Everlasting
[0:47] father something is going to be done the
[0:50] prophet of the Old Testament something
[0:51] is going to be done that's never been
[0:53] done before I'm going to do something
[0:56] that's never happened in the earth
[0:57] before a virgin
[1:01] not just a young Maiden but a young
[1:04] untouched Maiden is going to Bear a
[1:07] child think of this and he's going to be
[1:11] called Yeshua Jesus for he will bring
[1:18] Salvation to his people it will be
[1:22] misunderstood but it will come it will
[1:24] happen at the right time at the right
[1:27] moment under the right conditions
[1:30] and the New Testament tells us in the
[1:33] fullness of
[1:35] times when time had filled up and the
[1:39] Earth could not go on any longer without
[1:42] a messiah without a savior showing up
[1:46] the Bible also tells us that that the
[1:50] world the world could not contain the
[1:54] Scrolls if everything that he did in his
[1:58] ministry was
[2:00] recorded now I mean to tell you what
[2:03] that says to me is his ministry was not
[2:06] only shifting things on the Earth but
[2:10] also all the way to the third heaven
[2:13] things were being moved around there's
[2:16] no telling what kind of confusion was
[2:20] caused in the second heaven where the
[2:23] enemy puts his throne and where his imps
[2:26] liked us to dwell the prince of the
[2:28] power of the air the scripture tells us
[2:31] and so in order to record everything
[2:34] that was happening in Earth in second
[2:37] heaven third heaven all the way into the
[2:39] throne room of God the the the world
[2:42] wouldn't be big enough the LI there
[2:44] wouldn't be a library big enough to
[2:47] contain but I think John 10 is one of
[2:50] the greatest sermons that he preached
[2:52] because this was the day that he decided
[2:56] by inspiration to tell the world who he
[2:59] really was
[3:01] he'd been hiding his true
[3:03] identity until this moment and In This
[3:06] Moment he wanted to let all all the
[3:09] truth out there and Jesus walked in the
[3:12] temple in Solomon's porch then came the
[3:16] Jews round about him and said unto him
[3:18] how long Dost thou make us to doubt if
[3:21] thou be the Christ the Messiah the
[3:23] anointed one tell
[3:25] us do you ever just want to say go ahead
[3:28] and tell me and Jesus answered them
[3:31] verse 25 I told you and you believe not
[3:35] the works that I do in my father's name
[3:37] they bear witness of me but ye believe
[3:41] not because you're not of my sheep as I
[3:44] said unto you my sheep hear my voice and
[3:46] I know them and they follow me that's
[3:48] right he insulted them properly and he
[3:51] said and I give unto them eternal life
[3:53] and they shall never perish neither
[3:55] shall any man pluck them out of my hand
[3:58] did I just yell I did my Father which
[4:02] gave them me is greater than all and no
[4:04] man is able to pluck them out of my
[4:07] father's hand so you'll never be able to
[4:09] get him out of mine either he's telling
[4:11] us and then verse
[4:14] 30
[4:15] I and my
[4:18] father are one you can't worship Him in
[4:22] spirit and in
[4:25] truth if you don't know who he is the
[4:28] leading theologians of of our day miss
[4:30] it did you know what God
[4:32] is when you see
[4:35] Christ we wouldn't have known that had
[4:38] Jesus not answered the
[4:40] question by saying
[4:43] I and my
[4:45] father are one
