[0:00] not what was hanging over their head
[0:01] it's not the sound they heard in their
[0:04] ear it's that God had come to live
[0:07] inside of them
[0:08] [Music]
[0:14] what do you do when you light the
[0:16] menorah
[0:19] doesn't the light of the menorah
[0:23] doesn't it's an oil lamp remember
[0:26] doesn't it sort of look like a pillar of
[0:29] fire or a tongue of Fire
[0:32] isn't it powerful to to understand that
[0:36] in the same moment that the priest was
[0:40] lighting the Western Menorah that
[0:43] represents the Messiah that the Messiah
[0:46] was pouring out his holy spirit on his
[0:50] disciples just outside in one of those
[0:53] little rooms and you know what he did he
[0:54] lit them up
[0:56] just like the priest was putting fire to
[1:00] the oil the God himself was filling so
[1:04] you know it's it's a beautiful thought
[1:06] if you get the typology the menorah was
[1:10] inside the holy Place God had gathered
[1:13] now a hundred and twenty menorahs
[1:17] because his people were like candles
[1:20] with oil in them because he'd poured out
[1:22] the oil of the spirit and when the
[1:25] priest is lighting the oil here is God
[1:28] lighting the oil on his disciples who
[1:31] had gathered in one mind in one Accord
[1:33] in one place and suddenly Cove in
[1:37] tongues of fire from heaven
[1:40] came down upon each and every one of
[1:43] them and they began to speak in tongues
[1:47] and I mean it changed everything did you
[1:51] know it not only changed everything for
[1:54] them but it changed everything for us
[1:56] can anybody say Amen it's not what was
[1:59] hanging over their head it's not the
[2:02] sound they heard in their ear it's that
[2:04] God had come to live inside of them
[2:08] and no man or woman can encounter the
[2:11] reality of God and not experience
[2:14] something
[2:16] it's not about feeling but feelings will
[2:19] come
[2:21] right
[2:23] a man can't pass from Death to life and
[2:26] not have a feeling of some kind a
[2:29] sensation of some kind because if you
[2:31] set yourself on fire somebody's going to
[2:34] come to watch you burn
[2:35] how many of you know that's the truth
[2:37] and so all of a sudden all the attention
[2:40] nobody was watching the priest anymore
[2:42] to see them coming out from lighting the
[2:44] menorahs because God had lit his
[2:46] [Music]
[2:47] image I want you to leave here with
[2:49] today God lit his menorahs
[2:52] and his were not going to sit stationary
[2:54] in a temple
[2:56] they were going to spill out into the
[2:58] streets of Jerusalem and into the
[3:00] uttermost parts of the earth Acts
[3:02] chapter 1 verse 8 but you shall be
[3:05] endured
[3:07] with power from on high and you shall
[3:11] become my Witnesses
[3:13] both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and
[3:18] in Samaria and you read the last part of
[3:21] that and um
[3:24] God's looking for believers of this
[3:27] truth who will burn with a passion and
[3:30] the fire of the Holy Ghost and either
[3:33] take or sin this fire
[3:37] [Music]
[3:38] you know what happens if you if you come
[3:41] in contact with fire and it catches a
[3:43] hold of you and somebody tries to come
[3:45] and help you sometime the next thing you
[3:47] know it gets on them gets on them and
[3:50] gets on them do you know I once saw a
[3:52] vision of the entire continent of Africa
[3:54] with with fires breaking out in various
[3:58] places and Nations and Villages and
[4:01] those fires begin to to rage and grow
[4:05] and spread until the entire continent of
[4:08] Africa was on fire and it wasn't natural
[4:11] fire it was the fire of the Holy Ghost
