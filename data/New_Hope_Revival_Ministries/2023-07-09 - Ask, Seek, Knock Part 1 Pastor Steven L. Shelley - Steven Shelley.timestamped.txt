[46:37] Indiana God gave us three wonderful
[46:39] services
[46:41] and there was one brother who
[46:44] asked me to tell you hello
[46:47] and then he came to Youth Camp and he
[46:49] asked me to tell you hello and
[46:51] apparently he didn't trust me to get the
[46:53] word to you because he followed me home
[46:55] [Laughter]
[47:02] [Applause]
[47:05] we're so happy to have brother Isaac and
[47:07] Sister Mary stoltzfus and four of their
[47:09] children Susan Mary Elizabeth and Levi
[47:15] did I get him right
[47:16] I got four of them now brother Isaac
[47:21] and then at youth camp we saw Sister
[47:23] Sarah Robson and she came with her
[47:26] daughter Lillian and then Jonathan and
[47:30] Jeremiah and their friend Helena and
[47:32] we're real glad that they're here in the
[47:34] service with us from Idaho

[47:44] he used us along the way and we're just
[47:46] thankful for his grace we thank you for
[47:49] praying for us as we went on to the
[47:51] Youth Camp after we were in meetings
[47:53] with them God met us there with our
[47:57] former Amish brethren in such wonderful
[48:00] ways and God just came down and we just
[48:05] uh we're in Wonder at the Lord what he
[48:08] was doing and we just give him all the
[48:11] glory then as we moved on to Youth Camp
[48:14] we were just two hours away from the
[48:16] youth camp and God directed us to go
[48:18] there and uh used us as you were helping
[48:23] on this end to shift the atmosphere over
[48:25] the camp and we're grateful to what God
[48:28] did in those Services there at the byc
[48:31] believing God to continue his work among
[48:34] those young people that were there God
[48:37] is the only one who can change a heart
[48:42] use preachers he can use prayer but God
[48:45] is the only one that can change a heart
[48:47] as a heart is willing to be changed
[48:49] under the mighty hand of God and we're
[48:52] thankful for all that we saw him do
[48:54] along the way well we're glad to be in
[48:56] the house of the Lord here today and
[48:59] believe in him to continue to change our
[49:01] hearts to move on us and and Feed Us by
[49:05] his word and speak to us in ways that he
[49:08] desires to and piece by piece he helps
[49:11] us to get ourselves out of the way so
[49:14] that he can have more room in us because
[49:16] our desire is that we decrease and he
[49:20] increases
[49:22] that's my desire in this life for less
[49:25] of me and more of him that's what I want
[49:30] we want to receive the tithe and the
[49:32] offering today we want to give as giving
[49:34] unto the Lord we mentioned two weeks ago
[49:36] that we were going to postpone the

[59:36] we're going to have to go looking for
[59:37] them
[59:38] because we've gotten very used to having
[59:40] them and I'm so thankful for it I just
[59:43] got some very sad news personally and
[59:46] that is that a a friend of ours who used
[59:49] to play the violin in conferences where
[59:53] I was a speaker his name was Jason uh
[59:56] heistad I believe is the way that you
[59:59] pronounced it um
[1:00:00] some of you met him
[1:00:02] because he was in the uh uh Daphne
[1:00:06] meetings when brother green came and
[1:00:08] spoke he was a larger fella with the red
[1:00:10] kind of reddish beard and my goodness
[1:00:14] could he play
[1:00:16] and his wife beautiful Jackie passed
[1:00:19] away this morning young
[1:00:21] and they've got a young son I say young
[1:00:24] he's probably
[1:00:25] maybe close to being a teenager he is 16
[1:00:28] now
[1:00:29] and she fought a real fight and I'm very
[1:00:32] sorry for that family
[1:00:34] my my mind is going to him today because
[1:00:38] we had a wonderful conversation one time
[1:00:41] about the ministry of brother Branham
[1:00:44] and he showed so much respect these are
[1:00:47] just Pentecostal or charismatic type
[1:00:50] people but he showed so much respect
[1:00:53] and he complimented
[1:00:55] our life and and my wife's testimony
[1:01:00] among those people would you pray that
[1:01:02] the Lord would comfort his heart he is a
[1:01:05] real talented musician and very very
[1:01:08] anointed
[1:01:09] um if I showed you a picture some of you
[1:01:11] would remember him from the from the
[1:01:13] Daphne meeting my wife has some stickers
[1:01:16] this morning
[1:01:18] she said for the Sisters but you mean to
[1:01:21] give to the children or what do you mean
[1:01:29] did you see all the flowery ties the men
[1:01:31] had on this morning
[1:01:33] only women can like flowers
[1:01:36] did you know the greatest Gardeners of
[1:01:39] this nation were always men did you know
[1:01:42] Benjamin Franklin and our founding
[1:01:44] fathers were all gardeners
[1:01:47] back off I'm kidding
[1:01:51] I'm kidding
[1:01:53] I'm kidding I like flowers I like the
[1:01:56] garden anyway don't do much with it
[1:01:58] anymore but I have fond memories of when
[1:02:01] I used to
[1:02:02] um brother Bobby Wertz has these
[1:02:06] stickers printed what do they say
[1:02:08] have faith and some little flowers on
[1:02:10] them with a mustard seed that's right
[1:02:15] okay with the bloom of the mustard and
[1:02:18] he gives those out everywhere
[1:02:21] he goes
[1:02:22] and embarrasses us all sometime because
[1:02:26] he will chase somebody down through the
[1:02:28] parking lot to give him a sticker you
[1:02:29] want a sticker
[1:02:30] and people go
[1:02:32] you know they don't know what to do with
[1:02:34] it but you'd be surprised how many times
[1:02:37] those stickers have have really touched
[1:02:39] people's lives and it's a reminder to
[1:02:41] have faith so my girls carry them in
[1:02:44] their phone cases or on their phone case
[1:02:47] and you can have some that you can give
[1:02:50] some to the children or whatever you
[1:02:52] want to do and if there's a brother who
[1:02:54] wants to have faith I don't know why
[1:02:55] only sisters are supposed to have faith
[1:02:57] but if
[1:03:01] I'm in that kind of a mood you'll just
[1:03:03] have to pray for me
[1:03:06] I've I've been off this week a little
[1:03:08] bit so I'm kind of you know
[1:03:11] uh feeling a little ornery
[1:03:15] I don't want to pay too much later so
[1:03:17] I'll love my wife
[1:03:19] happy wife
[1:03:23] you got it
[1:03:26] wanted to get that out of the way I

[1:04:36] brother Eddie and Sister Janet Miller
[1:04:39] and she is having surgery this week a
[1:04:42] serious surgery and so we want to go to
[1:04:46] the Lord in prayer for her on on Friday
[1:04:49] there is a tumor in her spine that has
[1:04:52] been there for some time we thank God
[1:04:55] that it's not cancerous it's not
[1:04:57] malignant but it has wrapped itself
[1:05:00] around the nerves and it's going to be a
[1:05:03] little bit of a process I would think of
[1:05:06] of untangling that thing and getting it
[1:05:09] out but she needs the mobility and she
[1:05:12] needs to be pain-free she has a great
[1:05:14] responsibility on her shoulders that's
[1:05:17] brother Daniel's mother and Dad we're
[1:05:19] talking about and they are beginning to
[1:05:23] liquidate and their their desire and
[1:05:26] plans are to to come and live among us
[1:05:28] and we're looking forward to that and
[1:05:31] she needed to get this taken care of
[1:05:33] because of the hard days ahead of moving
[1:05:36] and all that she's going through so we
[1:05:38] want to say happy birthday to our
[1:05:41] brother and to remind Sister Janet that
[1:05:45] we are praying and we're believing God
[1:05:46] for not only guiding the surgeon's hands
[1:05:50] but miraculous
[1:05:53] Supernatural recovery that baffles the
[1:05:56] doctors Wednesday is that sister

[1:16:11] I believe it I believe it let's all
[1:16:14] stand Ephesians chapter 3
[1:16:17] beginning in verse 14. let's give thanks
[1:16:21] to God for the musicians and all of
[1:16:24] their labor the leading of worship
[1:16:28] cameraman the computer people the the
[1:16:31] streaming folks
[1:16:34] there's a lot that goes in to making
[1:16:37] this possible Ephesians chapter 3
[1:16:40] beginning in verse 14 we greet you
[1:16:43] saints that are streaming the service uh
[1:16:47] some even from Columbus Georgia Arkansas
[1:16:51] and I'm not sure where you're from
[1:16:53] Brother
[1:16:54] Samuel I can't make out that flag but
[1:16:56] God bless you all wherever you're from
[1:16:59] and that's on Facebook and then on
[1:17:03] on YouTube God bless the Saints in
[1:17:07] Indiana in Indiana
[1:17:09] uh Jennifer Stark streaming on her phone
[1:17:12] on the way home back to Indiana Norway
[1:17:15] Quebec Canada God bless you all there
[1:17:18] and uh India we send our love Cape Town
[1:17:23] greetings God bless you all and and just
[1:17:27] so many others that if you don't tell us
[1:17:29] where you're from we don't even know
[1:17:31] you're there and and we heard that while
[1:17:34] they were at Youth Camp some of them
[1:17:36] were talking and they recognize brother
[1:17:39] Greely not from knowing brother Greeley
[1:17:41] but from the Stream
[1:17:42] and it happened to be someone who who
[1:17:45] just really surprised just surprised
[1:17:48] that they were even streaming that they
[1:17:50] caught the service but we never know do
[1:17:53] we
[1:17:54] or sometimes we do
[1:17:57] because sometimes the Holy Spirit just
[1:17:59] opens it up
[1:18:00] but most of the time if he doesn't show
[1:18:02] us we don't know unless you put your
[1:18:04] flag in or tell us where you're from but
[1:18:07] God he has a way of joining us together
[1:18:10] the bride is hungry
[1:18:12] you're going to help me Preach Today
[1:18:15] Ephesians chapter 3 beginning in verse
[1:18:18] 14 for this cause I bow my knees unto
[1:18:23] the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of
[1:18:27] whom the whole family in Heaven and
[1:18:32] Earth is named that's powerful
[1:18:37] that helps me to understand that baptism
[1:18:40] is not to be in any other way but in the
[1:18:44] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:47] and we say because we know that his name
[1:18:51] in Hebrew was not Jesus his mother never
[1:18:54] would have used the name Jesus because
[1:18:56] it wasn't a name that was being used at
[1:18:59] that time so we also like to say Yeshua
[1:19:03] I like saying that sometime I'm not a
[1:19:06] fanatic I'm not a dogmatic I I I I'm not
[1:19:10] a sacred name like some of the groups
[1:19:12] that say that Jesus is adult name dog's
[1:19:16] name and it's known virtue oh you're too
[1:19:18] late to tell me it's not it's not
[1:19:21] pronouncing it just right
[1:19:23] no no no it's the faith it gets attached
[1:19:26] to it that moves oh my your way I've
[1:19:30] seen the dead raised in the name of
[1:19:32] Jesus so he answers to whatever we call
[1:19:35] him in faith every time I say that I
[1:19:38] remember that old song they used to sing
[1:19:40] uh sister Annie Jones I heard the song
[1:19:44] years before I knew sister Annie but
[1:19:47] sister Annie Jones who used to come here
[1:19:49] from Canada year after year she lived
[1:19:53] here part-time before she moved to
[1:19:55] Heaven she would sing that for me
[1:19:57] sometime and it's the old missionary
[1:20:00] song and it's a true story of a
[1:20:03] missionary going into a village where
[1:20:05] there was no the name of Jesus had never
[1:20:08] been mentioned and this this missionary
[1:20:11] testified of the Miracles that were done
[1:20:14] in this name and the little woman walked
[1:20:17] miles and miles and miles back through
[1:20:19] the jungles to get to her Village and as
[1:20:21] long as she could she kept repeating
[1:20:23] that name but as she grew weary she
[1:20:26] stopped saying the name and when she got
[1:20:28] home she forgot the name and she said oh
[1:20:31] Lord what will I do what will I do I
[1:20:33] don't remember the name she walked all
[1:20:35] the way hours back through the jungle
[1:20:37] woke the missionary up and said tell me
[1:20:40] his name again
[1:20:42] seeing me love sweetest refrain of one
[1:20:46] who
[1:20:53] in the whole family in heaven is called
[1:20:55] by that name and the whole family of God
[1:20:58] on the earth is called by that name
[1:21:01] aren't you glad to be one of them
[1:21:03] identified with his name
[1:21:05] and then it goes on to say that he would
[1:21:08] Grant you according to the riches of his
[1:21:12] glory to be strengthened with might by
[1:21:16] his spirit in the in the Inner Man your
[1:21:21] strength doesn't come in muscle and
[1:21:23] Brawn your strength comes from the inner
[1:21:26] man as you feed on Christ The Living
[1:21:28] Word your inner man as is strengthened
[1:21:32] as you spend time in the presence of the
[1:21:35] Lord as we are doing today your inner
[1:21:37] man receives the Breath of God and the
[1:21:40] strength of God do you believe that
[1:21:42] that Christ May dwell in your hearts by
[1:21:46] faith that ye being rooted and grounded
[1:21:50] in love
[1:21:52] rooted and grounded in love
[1:21:56] may be able to comprehend with All
[1:21:59] Saints what is the breadth and length
[1:22:03] and depth and height and to know the
[1:22:07] love of Christ which passeth knowledge
[1:22:10] that ye may be filled with all the
[1:22:15] fullness of God what happens when you
[1:22:18] feel somebody with all the fullness of
[1:22:22] God what do you have you have deity
[1:22:25] living in a human body
[1:22:28] that shouldn't stumble anybody
[1:22:31] what do you think the Holy Ghost is
[1:22:34] don't answer the third person of the
[1:22:36] Trinity because I'll tell you there's no
[1:22:38] Bible for that the very holy ghost in
[1:22:41] you is the creative Spirit of the father
[1:22:44] amen and so if deity lives in you all of
[1:22:47] you may not be deity
[1:22:49] because you still got a flesh body but
[1:22:52] this holy ghost that lives inside of you
[1:22:55] is God
[1:22:57] that's who it is
[1:22:58] it's God and this was not some mystery
[1:23:03] to the early church because here is the
[1:23:07] messenger clearly telling us to know the
[1:23:11] love of Christ which passive knowledge
[1:23:14] that you might be filled with all
[1:23:18] help me say all with all the fullness of
[1:23:22] God what a church what a bride what a
[1:23:25] people come on
[1:23:27] now unto him that is able to do
[1:23:31] exceeding abundantly above
[1:23:35] help me with the word all
[1:23:40] exceeding abundantly above all that we
[1:23:46] ask
[1:23:47] oh
[1:23:50] you know sometimes you can't pray big
[1:23:52] enough but you get to imagining big
[1:23:54] enough
[1:23:55] we got to learn to turn our imagination
[1:23:58] into prayer
[1:24:00] God has spoken to us more than once and
[1:24:03] said you're not asking big enough
[1:24:06] you're not believing big enough you're
[1:24:08] limiting me by your faith how many of
[1:24:11] you know we don't want to limit god with
[1:24:13] our faith we want to loose him with our
[1:24:15] faith
[1:24:17] amen according let's read this again
[1:24:21] because somebody keeps interrupting the
[1:24:23] reading of the scripture now unto him
[1:24:26] that is able to do exceeding abundantly
[1:24:30] above all that we ask or think so that
[1:24:34] means here we go again
[1:24:36] that means you can't even think it big
[1:24:39] enough
[1:24:40] because he's a you think as big as you
[1:24:42] possibly can of what God can do and then
[1:24:45] he can go right up above that exceeding
[1:24:47] abundantly above all that we ask or
[1:24:50] think according now listen how he works
[1:24:54] listen how he grants according to the
[1:24:58] power
[1:25:01] that works in him
[1:25:04] that works in US
[1:25:07] now we know where the power comes from
[1:25:09] it comes in us because he lives in US is
[1:25:14] that right
[1:25:15] under him be glory
[1:25:18] in the church by Christ Jesus
[1:25:22] throughout all ages World Without End
[1:25:26] Amen and the church said you may be
[1:25:30] seated as God should add his Blessing to
[1:25:33] the reading of his word I want to preach
[1:25:35] to you a little while this morning on a
[1:25:37] subject that's not new to you
[1:25:39] I've taken the subject a time or two
[1:25:42] through the years but I want to talk to
[1:25:44] you about asking abundantly
[1:25:46] somebody needs to get this
[1:25:49] somebody needs to know your prayers are
[1:25:52] stifling the master
[1:25:55] you're limiting him you're setting
[1:25:57] restriction on him by your church entity
[1:26:01] come on you need to know who you are I
[1:26:04] want to quote this again
[1:26:06] I heard brother Ronald Dean Spencer
[1:26:08] quote this at the dedication services
[1:26:11] for for
[1:26:13] um Word of Life I think you call it now
[1:26:16] and I've heard him use this a lot but I
[1:26:19] want to use it again uh
[1:26:21] the trainer of Muhammad Ali
[1:26:26] you know when I when I would listen as a
[1:26:29] boy to Muhammad Ali talking it it
[1:26:31] certainly sounded like he didn't need
[1:26:33] nobody to tell him who he was he needed
[1:26:36] somebody to remind him of his Humanity
[1:26:38] you know because he was a big talker
[1:26:41] talk about smack talk he was probably
[1:26:43] the doctor of smack talk you know the
[1:26:46] leader of that and and uh they used to
[1:26:49] say he floats like a butterfly he'd say
[1:26:52] it
[1:26:53] I float like a butterfly and sting like
[1:26:56] a bee one of the greatest boxers of all
[1:26:59] time you folks that are looking at me
[1:27:00] like uh I am worldly your Prophet was a
[1:27:03] boxer
[1:27:08] brother Branham was a boxer
[1:27:11] that doesn't mean I want to be one
[1:27:16] although I do would like to have a
[1:27:19] punching bag sometime
[1:27:21] wouldn't you
[1:27:23] I believe it would help me more than I
[1:27:25] can tell
[1:27:27] but uh he was a boxer quite a boxer his
[1:27:29] daughter boxes now they tell me
[1:27:32] and um but anyway
[1:27:35] uh the trainer said that he realized
[1:27:38] that his job his responsibility was not
[1:27:42] to teach Muhammad Ali how to fight
[1:27:44] because she already knew how to fight he
[1:27:47] said I'm not here today he's going into
[1:27:49] a big fight I'm not here today to teach
[1:27:51] you how to fight I'm here to remind you
[1:27:53] who you are you are the heavyweight
[1:27:54] champion of the world
[1:27:57] I am here to tell you who you are you
[1:28:00] are the champion and when you get in
[1:28:03] that boxing ring that's who you are and
[1:28:05] that's who you better remember you are
[1:28:07] and that's how you ought to perform as
[1:28:10] the champion of the world maybe you're
[1:28:12] not getting that
[1:28:14] but that is my responsibility again this
[1:28:17] morning to I can't teach you how to
[1:28:19] fight the devil the words already told
[1:28:21] you how to do that but I can remind you
[1:28:23] who you are I can tell you that he wants
[1:28:26] to move for you more than you want him
[1:28:28] to move
[1:28:29] I can tell you that your highest
[1:28:31] expectation is not big enough
[1:28:36] your greatest imagination of what God
[1:28:39] can do it doesn't begin to even match
[1:28:41] what he is capable of doing
[1:28:44] come on
[1:28:46] and we just have to make sure that we
[1:28:48] are looking at the right thing
[1:28:53] see I'm not one of those people who who
[1:28:55] believe this humanistic idea that you
[1:28:58] can be anything you want to be I
[1:29:00] absolutely don't believe that
[1:29:02] so you can't I can't preach that and I
[1:29:05] can't give a pep talk using that line
[1:29:08] because I want you to know you can be
[1:29:10] everything and anything that God created
[1:29:14] you to be
[1:29:16] but but not just what you want to be
[1:29:18] you may want to be the president you may
[1:29:21] never be the president you may never be
[1:29:23] able to be the president you're probably
[1:29:24] not crooked enough to be the president
[1:29:27] so you ought to get your sights a little
[1:29:30] higher than that anyhow so I'm not just
[1:29:33] telling you to sit there and think of
[1:29:34] you know what I want to be a millionaire
[1:29:37] and and so I'm going to start asking God
[1:29:39] to make me a millionaire there's nothing
[1:29:41] wrong with being a millionaire by the
[1:29:43] way I wished about three of you were
[1:29:45] millionaires
[1:29:48] four or five of you then we'd never have
[1:29:50] to receive another offering toward the
[1:29:52] principle
[1:29:54] so I'm not against somebody being a a
[1:29:57] millionaire but I'll tell you what the
[1:29:58] old preacher used to say God will give
[1:30:00] you what he can trusts you with
[1:30:03] and if you've got your eyes on on wisdom
[1:30:05] and watch it now don't don't
[1:30:06] misunderstand the scripture somebody
[1:30:08] said money is the root of all evil that
[1:30:11] is not what the scripture said you know
[1:30:13] better than that it said the Love of
[1:30:15] Money
[1:30:18] I know some people who have some money
[1:30:20] and they don't love it
[1:30:22] in fact at times they wish they didn't
[1:30:24] have to deal with it because where
[1:30:26] there's money there's sometime a lot of
[1:30:28] red tape and complication and heart
[1:30:29] Aiden problem come on now you got to set
[1:30:33] your affection on something higher than
[1:30:35] that but if you make sure that you're
[1:30:37] looking at the Kingdom I want to just
[1:30:39] say it I'll just spill my I'll just
[1:30:42] spill my my punchline right now if you
[1:30:46] are looking at the kingdom of God ahead
[1:30:48] of you you will always ask for the
[1:30:51] kingdom
[1:30:54] you'll ask for the kingdom you'll ask
[1:30:57] for what benefits the kingdom
[1:30:59] hello
[1:31:01] I want to read to you from Revelation
[1:31:03] chapter one let's go there
[1:31:06] beginning in verse 7 I've got several
[1:31:09] verses to read here and they're very
[1:31:10] familiar to you this is a beautiful
[1:31:13] revelation of Jesus in Revelation
[1:31:16] chapter one uh I want you to know that
[1:31:20] John starts out with his greetings and
[1:31:23] his salutations
[1:31:24] and I I'd like to to correct us a little
[1:31:28] bit this morning because sometimes when
[1:31:31] we're giving the address of a scripture
[1:31:33] we will say Revelations chapter 1.
[1:31:37] but that book is not called Revelations
[1:31:41] that book is called revelation
[1:31:46] because it's actually not a book of many
[1:31:49] Revelations like some people teach it's
[1:31:52] actually a book of one revelation
[1:31:55] yes it's introduced I'm not speaking on
[1:31:57] that this morning but it's introduced in
[1:31:59] chapter one this is the Revelation not
[1:32:01] the Revelation like the Catholic Church
[1:32:03] says in our Bible it's not the
[1:32:05] revelation of Saint John the Divine
[1:32:08] oh no no no this is the revelation of
[1:32:11] Jesus Christ and all other Mysteries and
[1:32:15] all other Revelations and all other
[1:32:17] truths fall under the umbrella of the
[1:32:20] revelation of Jesus Christ so it's the
[1:32:22] Revelation Revelation chapter one and
[1:32:26] John gives his greetings as salutations
[1:32:29] as he opens this uh Book of Revelation
[1:32:35] in chapter one and then he comes down to
[1:32:38] verse 7 and he says behold he cometh
[1:32:42] with clouds and every eye shall see him
[1:32:46] and they also which pierced him and all
[1:32:51] kindreds of the Earth shall wail because
[1:32:55] of him even so a man now this is not
[1:33:00] speaking about the Rapture this is not
[1:33:03] the resurrection Rapture of Christ this
[1:33:06] is the second coming of Christ this is
[1:33:10] what we really refer to as the
[1:33:12] revelation of Christ that's really his
[1:33:14] second coming is is his Revelation
[1:33:17] because in the Rapture we're not seeing
[1:33:20] him until we get to where he is
[1:33:22] and the other citizens of the earth they
[1:33:25] don't see him in the cloud
[1:33:27] they don't even know he's there they
[1:33:29] don't know that the bride has been
[1:33:31] caught up into another dimension into
[1:33:33] another realm they most of the time they
[1:33:36] just keep on going right like they've
[1:33:38] been going brother random said you're
[1:33:39] you're not getting it right if you've
[1:33:41] got this picture of of angels coming
[1:33:43] down and and digging out the graves and
[1:33:46] the Saints getting up
[1:33:47] he said you'll pass by the cemetery and
[1:33:50] it's undisturbed you'll never know the
[1:33:52] dead in Christ got up they don't get up
[1:33:55] by kicking the dirt out of their way
[1:33:56] it's a it's a change
[1:33:59] anybody following me and they used to
[1:34:01] show movies that's Left Behind series
[1:34:03] and some of the paintings that went
[1:34:06] behind some of that church annity it
[1:34:08] really is what it was they've got a cars
[1:34:11] you know veering off the highway and
[1:34:12] planes veering off in the sky they're
[1:34:15] unmanned and and what a chaos but the
[1:34:18] reality is the rapture is not for The
[1:34:21] Universal Church
[1:34:23] the Rapture is for the Bride of Jesus
[1:34:25] Christ amen those who have already
[1:34:28] washed their robes in the blood of the
[1:34:30] lamb and those who have had their
[1:34:32] garments purified by the word
[1:34:34] so it's not just the blood that purifies
[1:34:37] us it's the revealed word of the hour
[1:34:39] that also cleanses us and gets all the
[1:34:42] spots and wrinkles off of our garment so
[1:34:44] that we can go in that Resurrection
[1:34:46] Rapture the church Universal goes into
[1:34:49] that last portion of the tribulation and
[1:34:52] many give their lives for Christ
[1:34:55] now you say that's a mighty awful thing
[1:34:57] no it's actually a glorious thing that
[1:34:59] they get an opportunity to get their
[1:35:01] robes clean because the universal church
[1:35:04] is dirty
[1:35:06] she spotted by man's Traditions she
[1:35:09] spotted by man's doctrines she spotted
[1:35:12] by misinterpretations of the word I wish
[1:35:15] somebody would help me today
[1:35:18] you know her gospel today is this don't
[1:35:21] judge this is the gospel of the modern
[1:35:23] Church don't judge
[1:35:26] you can't let anybody feel bad
[1:35:28] nobody should feel bad about what they
[1:35:31] do or how they live or who they sleep
[1:35:33] with
[1:35:35] we got to include them all that's not
[1:35:37] the Gospel of Jesus Christ that's not
[1:35:39] what the word says so the universal
[1:35:42] church has got some purging to go
[1:35:44] through
[1:35:45] while the bride is being purged in this
[1:35:48] hour
[1:35:48] you're going through you're purging Now
[1:35:51] The Universal Church goes through her
[1:35:53] purging then
[1:35:54] now what we have to remember I'm ahead
[1:35:57] of myself but what we have to remember
[1:35:59] is we must not get our eyes on the
[1:36:02] pollution of the church at Large
[1:36:04] when we speak of the church we should
[1:36:07] speak of the Bride church and the bride
[1:36:09] church is perfect as he is perfect
[1:36:12] somebody said well I look around here
[1:36:14] and I see a bunch of imperfect people we
[1:36:16] ain't talking about people
[1:36:20] we're not talking about an organization
[1:36:22] we're talking about a congregation we're
[1:36:25] not talking about a location
[1:36:27] we're talking about a Mystic body
[1:36:30] this mystical body of Jesus Christ is
[1:36:34] pure and perfected by the blood of the
[1:36:37] Lamb by the word of her testimony by the
[1:36:41] righteousness of the word
[1:36:43] plans
[1:36:45] amen
[1:36:46] and so we need to get a little
[1:36:48] revelation of that that when we're
[1:36:50] looking at each other when we start
[1:36:52] seeing the flaws in one another we're
[1:36:54] looking at the right the wrong thing
[1:36:56] we're looking at the wrong thing and
[1:36:59] when you're looking at the wrong thing
[1:37:01] you can't just ask for whatever you want
[1:37:03] to ask for and it be handed to you
[1:37:07] come on
[1:37:09] when you're looking at the wrong thing
[1:37:11] let me say this again I'm going to have
[1:37:13] to work a little harder today
[1:37:15] when you are looking at the wrong thing
[1:37:17] you don't you don't just use prayer like
[1:37:19] some kind of magic uh charm you know
[1:37:22] well I can just I can look at whatever I
[1:37:24] want to and live any way I want to live
[1:37:26] but prayer will always work that's not
[1:37:28] right
[1:37:29] and anybody that's been in the faith
[1:37:31] long at all knows that it just don't
[1:37:34] work that way this is not a lucky
[1:37:35] rabbit's foot that you carry around on
[1:37:38] your keychain this is not a horseshoe
[1:37:40] over your door this has got to be God's
[1:37:43] way or it don't work at all
[1:37:45] and so I encourage you to get your eyes
[1:37:47] off the church
[1:37:49] I encourage you to get your eyes off The
[1:37:52] Universal Church
[1:37:53] she's lukewarm at best
[1:37:58] get your eyes off of her we don't have
[1:38:01] time to spend all of our time in here
[1:38:03] talking about how filthy she is
[1:38:06] because when you're looking at the wrong
[1:38:08] thing you can ask what you will
[1:38:12] [Music]
[1:38:14] it's only when you're focusing on the
[1:38:16] right thing
[1:38:18] the right one it's only when you're
[1:38:21] looking at the full revelation of Jesus
[1:38:23] Christ he is not are you with me
[1:38:27] then every now and again look up this
[1:38:28] way I may not be pretty but I'm the man
[1:38:30] for the hour
[1:38:34] I just want to know you're here
[1:38:37] this unveiling of Jesus Christ is such
[1:38:40] an important thing the apocalipsis it's
[1:38:43] why we have the revelation
[1:38:45] now remember there are some of us who
[1:38:47] know that if we really want to get the
[1:38:50] church ages we go right back to the
[1:38:51] tapes
[1:38:53] everything else we look at We compare it
[1:38:57] to what the message has already taught
[1:38:59] us especially when we're dealing with Dr
[1:39:01] levale's book
[1:39:04] we always want to bring that back
[1:39:07] because there's a paragraph or two
[1:39:09] that's been troubling me one this
[1:39:10] particular week because Brother Joseph
[1:39:12] was quoting that in his weekly letter to
[1:39:16] the Saints and it disturbs me just a
[1:39:18] little bit because brother Branham never
[1:39:20] says it it's never said in the message
[1:39:23] of the hour it's in reference to the
[1:39:26] seventh Church age messenger and his
[1:39:29] responsibility uh the church age book
[1:39:32] tells us something like this he is to
[1:39:34] reveal all the Mysteries
[1:39:37] including the seven Thunders
[1:39:41] and brother Branham does not say that in
[1:39:43] the message of the hour that is that is
[1:39:46] a little bit of Lee vale's
[1:39:47] interpretation
[1:39:49] because as long as brother Branham was
[1:39:51] alive Dr Vale put everything in brother
[1:39:54] Branham
[1:39:55] soon as brother Branham died brother
[1:39:57] Vale put everything in himself
[1:40:00] [Music]
[1:40:02] I'm just telling it like it is this
[1:40:05] don't matter to some of you visitors
[1:40:06] because you don't even know but I'm
[1:40:07] talking about the seven Church age book
[1:40:09] which is a wonderful tool
[1:40:11] and is full of tremendous truth
[1:40:15] but the problem is in that book in that
[1:40:18] time that that was being written brother
[1:40:20] Vale believed that brother Branham was
[1:40:22] to do everything
[1:40:25] including being the angel that John was
[1:40:28] falling before
[1:40:30] he had all kinds of thoughts and placed
[1:40:33] everything in brother random but not too
[1:40:35] long after brother Branham passed away
[1:40:37] Dr Vale decided that he was called to
[1:40:41] correct
[1:40:44] the mistakes
[1:40:46] that brother Branham had made in his own
[1:40:49] ministry that's a dangerous mistake
[1:40:51] come on now
[1:40:53] because now you've gotta you've got a
[1:40:55] quotation out there that Dr Vale did not
[1:40:58] believe in the latter part of his
[1:41:00] ministry
[1:41:01] but you've got the bride out there most
[1:41:03] of which don't know any different
[1:41:06] because if the church age book said it
[1:41:08] it's just the same as brother random
[1:41:09] preaching it under inspiration hello
[1:41:13] I know this is a little controversial
[1:41:16] that's why I don't get to preach the
[1:41:17] youth camps anymore
[1:41:22] controversial
[1:41:29] he didn't believe that everything was
[1:41:31] hanging in that messenger he believed
[1:41:34] that there was a bride that was going to
[1:41:36] follow a many membered bride the adopted
[1:41:41] sons of God who were going to look at
[1:41:44] the right thing and because they were
[1:41:46] focusing on the Lord Jesus and not a
[1:41:49] prophet because they were focusing on
[1:41:51] the Lord Jesus and not brother Branham
[1:41:54] they were going to be able to do the
[1:41:56] Greater Works of Jesus Christ in the
[1:41:59] Earth
[1:42:00] that's what I'm preaching
[1:42:02] and that's what I'm believing
[1:42:04] brother the Branham didn't take
[1:42:06] everything and place it in himself
[1:42:08] placed it in a people that would take
[1:42:12] the truth that was restored by that
[1:42:15] messenger back to the Bible
[1:42:21] because the foundation of all truth has
[1:42:24] to be God it has to be the word of God
[1:42:27] did I lose some of my help
[1:42:30] maybe I lost some streamers I don't know
[1:42:32] but they just keep spitting out the same
[1:42:35] error
[1:42:39] doesn't produce life
[1:42:42] doesn't produce Deliverance
[1:42:45] it doesn't produce hope
[1:42:47] because it puts everything behind us
[1:42:50] and I don't know about you but if this
[1:42:52] is the millennium
[1:42:55] I am really disappointed
[1:42:58] if this is my new body
[1:43:01] oh Lord
[1:43:04] hello
[1:43:06] I sit down in the chair for an hour and
[1:43:10] get up and I'm stiff
[1:43:12] anybody know what it feels like
[1:43:18] yeah you're right across town and you're
[1:43:21] going to get out and and you're stiff
[1:43:22] and you got to get I finally get
[1:43:25] lubricated a while after a while I get
[1:43:27] going
[1:43:28] I I find myself stumbling around like I
[1:43:31] used to never stumble around before and
[1:43:34] my foot hangs on things and if this is
[1:43:37] the new body
[1:43:39] then I don't have enough hope to quit
[1:43:41] preaching let's go home
[1:43:44] oh no this isn't a millennium
[1:43:47] no this isn't the new body oh no the
[1:43:51] bride hasn't had her Revival yet
[1:43:56] when she does the true revelation of
[1:44:00] those seven unknown Thunders will be
[1:44:02] known and it will produce in her a faith
[1:44:06] for the rapture
[1:44:08] that's what he said
[1:44:10] that's when these old bodies change they
[1:44:13] change because of Revelation Revelation
[1:44:16] changes this body
[1:44:18] right now Revelation is changing the
[1:44:21] Inner Man you wait until Revelation
[1:44:23] starts changing the outer body
[1:44:26] [Applause]
[1:44:27] what happened to brother soda he got
[1:44:30] that Revelation the Holy Ghost is just
[1:44:33] making the word real to him and he's
[1:44:35] moving like a younger person
[1:44:37] somebody said I don't believe that's
[1:44:38] biblical don't tell Abraham that
[1:44:42] don't tell Abraham that that recognizing
[1:44:45] the right person won't change your body
[1:44:51] when Abraham got a revelation of who was
[1:44:53] talking to him in the tent
[1:44:55] it changed his physical body and even
[1:44:58] though Sarah laughed at it initially
[1:45:01] there's room for some of the rest of you
[1:45:03] Sarahs
[1:45:06] come on I just want to welcome you
[1:45:08] Sarah's out there who laughed at this
[1:45:10] stuff originally
[1:45:12] I want you to know her body was changed
[1:45:14] too
[1:45:15] [Applause]
[1:45:17] because she followed her Lord
[1:45:25] who was her Lord
[1:45:28] Abraham
[1:45:30] the Bible tells us that Sarah called
[1:45:32] Abraham Lord
[1:45:34] she knew that he was the source now that
[1:45:36] doesn't mean uh what a lot of people
[1:45:38] would like for it to mean
[1:45:40] it doesn't mean that the woman is
[1:45:43] supposed to be you know a rug
[1:45:49] for you to step on
[1:45:51] you sorry excuse for a man
[1:45:53] [Applause]
[1:45:55] you need to hear what the prophet said
[1:45:57] because he took it from the word
[1:46:01] she's your queen
[1:46:02] [Music]
[1:46:03] I don't care how uh flawed she is how
[1:46:08] human she may be she's your queen and
[1:46:12] the Bible tells us the way to help her
[1:46:13] change is to love her like Christ loved
[1:46:16] the church
[1:46:17] I'm getting some I'm seeing some
[1:46:19] husband-wife nudges in here
[1:46:22] I love it I'm seeing some folks
[1:46:24] Hallelujah
[1:46:27] just don't throw them amen bombs
[1:46:31] when you're sitting right next to your
[1:46:32] wife and you want her to hear something
[1:46:34] you say
[1:46:37] [Music]
[1:46:42] instead of doing that and distracting us
[1:46:44] all why don't you just punch her and say
[1:46:46] he's preaching at you
[1:46:54] oh I'm having too much fun
[1:46:58] the holy cometh with clouds and every
[1:47:01] eye shall see him and they also which
[1:47:04] pierced him and all Kindred to the Earth
[1:47:06] shall well because of him even so amen I
[1:47:08] am Alpha
[1:47:10] and Omega
[1:47:17] it'd be wonderful if Jesus said that but
[1:47:19] he didn't speak Greek
[1:47:24] he spoke Aramaic
[1:47:26] which was Loosely based on Hebrew so he
[1:47:30] probably said I am the elephant the top
[1:47:33] but to me it doesn't matter if it was a
[1:47:36] and z or Alpha and Omega or aleph I get
[1:47:40] the point
[1:47:41] because he goes on to elaborate the
[1:47:43] beginning and the ending
[1:47:45] I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and
[1:47:49] the ending saith the Lord and if you
[1:47:51] don't know how long he was he said which
[1:47:53] is
[1:47:55] and which was
[1:47:57] and which is to come
[1:48:00] the almighty Jesus just called himself
[1:48:03] be Almighty Jesus just told John I'm God
[1:48:07] damn
[1:48:07] I'm him
[1:48:10] I'm not just here to represent him I am
[1:48:13] him
[1:48:14] come on let's read on
[1:48:16] John who also am your brother and
[1:48:19] companion in Tribulation and in the
[1:48:22] kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was
[1:48:25] in The Isle that is called Patmos
[1:48:27] now now Patmos means Loosely the meaning
[1:48:31] of the root of Patmos is my killing
[1:48:36] so John is actually saying I am in the
[1:48:40] aisle or I was in the aisle that is
[1:48:42] called my killing
[1:48:46] because if you're ever going to see a
[1:48:48] revelation
[1:48:49] that means you've got to get beyond your
[1:48:51] own thinking
[1:48:54] you've got to get beyond your own church
[1:48:56] entity your own indoctrination
[1:49:00] and you've got to begin to see him
[1:49:03] and if you get a revelation that doesn't
[1:49:05] line up with the message of the hour
[1:49:06] that lines up with the word God didn't
[1:49:08] send it let me just make sure you
[1:49:11] understand if you get some idea that
[1:49:14] doesn't line up with the message of
[1:49:15] truth that lines up with the word God
[1:49:18] didn't send it let me make sure you
[1:49:20] understand what I'm saying today if you
[1:49:22] get some idea that you believe is a
[1:49:25] revelation that doesn't fit the message
[1:49:27] of truth that lines up with the word of
[1:49:30] God
[1:49:31] God didn't send it
[1:49:33] it may be a good idea but it might not
[1:49:36] be a god idea
[1:49:39] you may believe something there may be
[1:49:41] some truth to it but you can't make a
[1:49:43] Doctrine out of anything that doesn't
[1:49:45] line up with that revelation of Jesus
[1:49:48] Christ which is based directly on the
[1:49:50] word I've got to hurry
[1:49:53] he was on Patmos for the word of God I
[1:49:56] can't even tell you that some of the
[1:49:58] things he went through before he got
[1:49:59] there but for one they tried to make a
[1:50:01] French fry out of John
[1:50:04] they tried to boil him in oil now I
[1:50:07] don't know what they call that where
[1:50:08] you're from but where I'm from they call
[1:50:10] that fry
[1:50:13] when you boil something in oil you fry
[1:50:16] it so they tried to fry the Revelation
[1:50:19] out of John
[1:50:20] but he was born for a purpose and that
[1:50:23] was to see Jesus unveiled
[1:50:26] the devil
[1:50:28] the leader
[1:50:33] see a revelation
[1:50:34] [Applause]
[1:50:35] the devil can't kill you
[1:50:37] [Applause]
[1:50:40] not even your foolishness can kill you
[1:50:43] if you were born to see a revelation
[1:50:46] until you see that revelation God will
[1:50:50] hang you around you'll hang around
[1:50:52] because of him
[1:50:54] if he has to put you on a nail somewhere
[1:50:57] he'll hang you around
[1:50:59] until you see what you're supposed to
[1:51:01] see because God takes that election
[1:51:04] predestination
[1:51:07] foreknowledge
[1:51:09] very serious is anybody helping me
[1:51:12] I don't even know
[1:51:14] all right he goes on and he says I was
[1:51:18] in the spirit on the Lord's day I don't
[1:51:19] have time you know me I'd love to preach
[1:51:21] that that's not Sabbath that's not
[1:51:25] Sunday that's the Lord's day I read a
[1:51:28] commentary recently where a path
[1:51:30] preacher said that couldn't be the
[1:51:31] Lord's day because the Lord's day was
[1:51:33] full of Wrath and judgment and that and
[1:51:35] that John wasn't caught up to the day of
[1:51:37] the Wrath and judgment so that had to be
[1:51:39] on a Sunday and I've read that the
[1:51:41] messianics say it had to be on a
[1:51:42] Saturday and the truth is it's my day
[1:51:47] he saw my day
[1:51:49] John saw the last hour John saw the
[1:51:52] closing hours he saw a lot more than
[1:51:54] that but he saw the closing hours of
[1:51:56] laodicea
[1:51:57] he saw right where we are in the church
[1:51:59] age plan of God right now I was in the
[1:52:02] spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[1:52:03] listen now you've got to catch this and
[1:52:05] heard behind me a great voice as of a
[1:52:09] trumpet
[1:52:11] now what did the verse say before before
[1:52:13] that he said behold he cometh not the
[1:52:16] not the verse directly before it but the
[1:52:18] verse that we started with said behold
[1:52:20] he cometh with the clouds and every eye
[1:52:22] shall see him and they also which
[1:52:23] pierced him in all kindreds of the Earth
[1:52:25] shall well because of him even so amen
[1:52:27] we mentioned that that's the second
[1:52:29] coming that's the ushering end of the
[1:52:30] kingdom of God
[1:52:33] and he said that again that second
[1:52:34] coming is the ushering end of the
[1:52:36] kingdom of God the breaking forth of the
[1:52:38] millennial Dawn are you following me so
[1:52:41] guess what John was looking at
[1:52:44] he was looking at the breaking forth of
[1:52:46] the millennial Dawn he was looking forth
[1:52:49] at the Kingdom
[1:52:50] notice where the voice came
[1:52:53] The Voice didn't come from the kingdom
[1:52:55] and speak directly face to face with
[1:52:58] John
[1:52:59] The Voice came from the church age I'll
[1:53:01] show you
[1:53:02] I'll show you
[1:53:04] he said I Heard a Voice I heard behind
[1:53:07] me a great voice
[1:53:09] as of a trumpet
[1:53:11] now here's John looking at the Kingdom
[1:53:13] but the voice didn't speak to John from
[1:53:16] Kingdom the The Voice spoke to John from
[1:53:19] church
[1:53:23] he had to turn around I hope you'll
[1:53:24] follow this go back one verse charity
[1:53:27] I'm sorry I'm working you extra hard as
[1:53:30] of a trumpet I was in the spirit on the
[1:53:31] Lord's day and heard behind me a great
[1:53:33] voice as of a trumpet now let's read on
[1:53:37] saying I am Alpha and Omega first and
[1:53:41] the last and what thou see is right in a
[1:53:44] book and send it unto the seven churches
[1:53:46] which are in Asia unto Ephesus unto
[1:53:48] Smyrna under pergamus unto thyterra unto
[1:53:51] Sardis unto Philadelphia and under
[1:53:53] laodicea seven churches in Asia Minor
[1:53:56] most commentators agree that this was
[1:54:00] not just speaking about characteristics
[1:54:02] of seven local churches in Asia Minor
[1:54:05] but it was also prophetically speaking
[1:54:09] of of Ages of church ages to come where
[1:54:13] these Spirits these uh characteristics
[1:54:16] these attributes would be predominantly
[1:54:19] on display in a particular period of
[1:54:22] History which is so fascinating that
[1:54:25] every attribute
[1:54:27] that was going to be brought to us
[1:54:30] through the church ages and all seven
[1:54:32] Church ages of History was all present
[1:54:35] in the Earth at the same time in seven
[1:54:37] churches these are not the only churches
[1:54:39] that there were and these are not the
[1:54:41] only churches in Asia mind or that there
[1:54:43] were
[1:54:44] but these were seven churches that had
[1:54:46] so much in them so much going on in them
[1:54:49] that they actually became a prophetic
[1:54:52] symbol of everything listen of
[1:54:55] everything that God would do Ephesus to
[1:54:57] laodicea
[1:54:59] interesting to study that
[1:55:01] God wasn't going to do anything Church
[1:55:05] without it being from Ephesus all the
[1:55:07] way across the church ages down to
[1:55:09] laodicea and everything the spirit of
[1:55:12] the Overcomer was in the church and the
[1:55:15] spirit of the age was in the church at
[1:55:17] one particular time but it was also
[1:55:19] prophesying of seven Church ages of
[1:55:23] History most of you should be very
[1:55:25] familiar with that now let's go on
[1:55:28] and I turned
[1:55:33] and I turned
[1:55:35] he's already looking at Kingdom
[1:55:39] but God was not going to reveal the
[1:55:41] kingdom to him
[1:55:42] until he revealed the church to him
[1:55:47] he had to see what God was going to be
[1:55:49] in the churches
[1:55:51] what God was going to do in the church
[1:55:53] ages before he could see what God was
[1:55:55] going to do in the Kingdom
[1:55:58] now if you follow the book of the
[1:55:59] Revelation you'll find out that there is
[1:56:02] Kingdom revealed
[1:56:03] Revelation 19 Begins the revelation of
[1:56:06] the Kingdom
[1:56:08] I saw a white horse rider I saw one on a
[1:56:12] white horse he's faithful and true
[1:56:16] coming with
[1:56:18] myriads of Angels the Saints riding
[1:56:21] white horses I'm not quoting it directly
[1:56:23] but you understand
[1:56:24] uh
[1:56:27] should I I I I don't want to do that
[1:56:30] right now but I've maybe someone
[1:56:33] um give me Revelation 19 would you I
[1:56:35] don't

[1:57:05] stand up so they can see you and hear
[1:57:07] you

[1:57:11] behold a white horse and he that sat
[1:57:14] upon him was called faithful and true
[1:57:16] and in righteousness he doth judge and
[1:57:19] make war now tell me where we're reading
[1:57:21] since we can't see it there Revelation
[1:57:22] 19 what
[1:57:24] 1911 Revelation 19 11. now we're going
[1:57:27] into 12. read it for us his eyes were as
[1:57:30] a flame of fire and on his head were
[1:57:33] many crowns many crowns and he had a
[1:57:35] name written that no man knew but he
[1:57:38] himself no man knew
[1:57:40] and he was clothed with a Vester dipped
[1:57:42] in Blood and his name is called the word
[1:57:45] of God praise God
[1:57:47] and the armies and the armies which were
[1:57:50] in heaven followed him upon the white
[1:57:53] horses
[1:57:54] wow
[1:57:57] you people that are scared of horses
[1:58:02] read on clothed and fine linen white and
[1:58:06] clean praise God the bride the Bride of
[1:58:09] every age
[1:58:10] coming back with him riding white horses
[1:58:13] dressed in fine linen which is the
[1:58:16] righteousness of of God in the Saints
[1:58:18] white and clean read a little more maybe
[1:58:22] and out of his mouth go with a sharp
[1:58:25] sword that with it he should smites that
[1:58:28] the Nations and he shall rule them with
[1:58:31] a rod of iron and he treteth the wine
[1:58:34] press
[1:58:35] of the fierceness and Wrath of almighty
[1:58:38] God Amen brother that's great reading
[1:58:40] thank you so much let's thank God for
[1:58:41] Elias doing that for us
[1:58:47] now that's the kingdom coming
[1:58:49] revelation 19.
[1:58:52] John was looking at trying to look at
[1:58:55] the Kingdom in Revelation 1.
[1:58:58] but John wasn't going to be able to
[1:59:00] understand the coming of the Kingdom
[1:59:02] until he understood what God was going
[1:59:04] to do in the church ages so the voice
[1:59:07] that came to him didn't come before him
[1:59:09] the voice came behind him
[1:59:11] and so he had to turn toward the voice
[1:59:14] let's go back to Revelation 1 and get
[1:59:16] those verses there and I turned to see
[1:59:19] the voice that spake with me and being
[1:59:21] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[1:59:24] which we know were lamps
[1:59:26] and in the midst of the seven
[1:59:28] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[1:59:30] man clothed with a garment down to the
[1:59:32] foot and gird about the paps with a
[1:59:34] golden girdle we're going all the way to
[1:59:36] verse 18. his head and his hairs were
[1:59:38] white like wool as white as snow his
[1:59:40] eyes were as a flame of fire and his
[1:59:43] feet like undefined brass as if they
[1:59:46] burned in a furnace and his voice as the
[1:59:49] sound of many Waters and he hath in his
[1:59:52] right hand Seven Stars and out of his
[1:59:55] mouth went a sharp to edge sword does
[1:59:58] this sound like the same Christ to you
[2:00:00] that we just read about in Revelation
[2:00:02] 19. it is
[2:00:04] all right and his countenance was as the
[2:00:07] sun shineth in his strength and when I
[2:00:11] saw him
[2:00:15] tell us what happened
[2:00:17] I fell at his feet as dead
[2:00:23] I I I John I John was looking at the
[2:00:27] Kingdom
[2:00:29] but I couldn't understand the kingdom
[2:00:32] now now this should answer a question
[2:00:34] because sometimes people come around and
[2:00:37] they say why are they always talking
[2:00:38] about the seven Church ages why are they
[2:00:41] always talking about church history and
[2:00:44] how God moved in those seven ages of
[2:00:46] church history here's why you can't
[2:00:49] understand the coming Kingdom until you
[2:00:52] understand how God moves in the church
[2:00:54] you've got to see the church ages before
[2:00:57] you can see listen you've got to see the
[2:01:00] church ages before you understand the
[2:01:02] seals
[2:01:04] you've got to see where God was where he
[2:01:07] is and where he's going to be and you've
[2:01:09] got to see it all at the same time
[2:01:11] and there's no way that our little human
[2:01:13] mind could do that unless the Holy
[2:01:16] Spirit quickens the word and makes it
[2:01:18] alive to us like a revelation and I want
[2:01:20] you to know you can't whip the Devil
[2:01:22] with a shout you can't whip the Devil
[2:01:24] with a jump you can't whip the devil
[2:01:26] with tongues and interpretation but you
[2:01:29] can whip the Devil with a revelation
[2:01:32] you get you a revelation of the word and
[2:01:34] there's not a devil that can stand
[2:01:36] before you because you don't meet him
[2:01:38] with your sensation you don't meet him
[2:01:41] with your emotion you meet him with the
[2:01:43] revelation of the word
[2:01:45] he can't stand that
[2:01:48] you see you you I believe in jumping
[2:01:50] around you know I'm going to have I'm
[2:01:52] going to have a church that's alive I am
[2:01:54] not going to Pastor a church that's dead
[2:01:58] I'm not going to spend my time
[2:02:00] worshiping with people that could care
[2:02:02] less about worship
[2:02:05] I'm too old for that
[2:02:07] I mean it I'm too over that in fact I'm
[2:02:09] not going to sit in too many services
[2:02:13] I don't have to
[2:02:15] somebody said aren't you going to the
[2:02:17] meeting there aren't you going to the
[2:02:18] meeting there no I don't have to sit in
[2:02:20] a dead service
[2:02:23] you go take some life to them
[2:02:25] let me stay plugged in here so I can
[2:02:28] help you when you get back
[2:02:30] because sometimes you come back shouting
[2:02:32] the Victory and sometimes you come back
[2:02:33] limping
[2:02:36] hey because it's not a party out there
[2:02:39] there's a devil that's against what you
[2:02:41] carry there's demons that are against
[2:02:44] the truth that you possess
[2:02:46] you get whipped sometime and you don't
[2:02:48] even know who's whipping you you don't
[2:02:50] even know where the licks are coming
[2:02:51] from hello
[2:02:54] so here's John when I saw him
[2:02:56] when I saw this glorified Christ
[2:02:59] the last time I saw him he didn't look
[2:03:01] like this remember
[2:03:04] [Music]
[2:03:07] now he's glorified
[2:03:09] oh and I fell at his feet as a dead man
[2:03:11] he laid his right hand upon me and said
[2:03:13] unto me what we all want to hear him say
[2:03:15] sometime fear not
[2:03:18] I'm the first and the last
[2:03:22] that's just a little wake-up alarm hello
[2:03:25] [Music]
[2:03:33] I don't know what you have your Monday
[2:03:35] morning alarm set for but I wished I did
[2:03:37] because I'd play it in here sometime
[2:03:39] when you're sleeping
[2:03:42] you I guarantee you some of you jump up
[2:03:44] and start to get us try to look for the
[2:03:46] shower
[2:03:47] you'd look for the coffee pot or the
[2:03:49] shower
[2:03:50] some of you get such a long nap you
[2:03:52] wouldn't know where you was when you
[2:03:54] woke up I'm afraid hello
[2:04:10] don't worry John
[2:04:13] I am he that liveth and was dead
[2:04:16] all of that
[2:04:18] and behold I Am Alive forevermore
[2:04:24] oh I'm done with the debt you know what
[2:04:26] he's saying to John I'm done with the
[2:04:27] death stuff
[2:04:35] the keys of hell and of death
[2:04:42] he said in the verses that we just read
[2:04:44] he said I heard behind me a great voice
[2:04:46] as of a trumpet these words are very
[2:04:49] significant they make known to us the
[2:04:51] position of John his back toward the
[2:04:54] Church his face toward the kingdom John
[2:04:56] heard the voice behind him the voice was
[2:04:59] in the midst of the seven golden
[2:05:00] candlesticks or lap stands the churches
[2:05:03] therefore we know John's back was to the
[2:05:06] churches and his face was toward the
[2:05:09] kingdom of God even at that early date
[2:05:11] but God said John you first got to get
[2:05:13] what I'm doing here what I have done
[2:05:15] what I will do and then I'm going to let
[2:05:17] you see my kingdom so this is why when
[2:05:20] the revelation of Jesus Christ began to
[2:05:22] come he brought through that Prophet the
[2:05:24] church age is first
[2:05:26] before the seals
[2:05:28] because you can't see Kingdom that's out
[2:05:31] there you can't see Kingdom until you
[2:05:33] understand Church
[2:05:35] yeah
[2:05:36] and if you've heard that revelation of
[2:05:37] Jesus Christ series
[2:05:40] we call the church ages if you've heard
[2:05:43] that revelation of Jesus Christ series
[2:05:44] you've seen the church
[2:05:46] if you've heard that you've seen the
[2:05:48] church and he lays it out I'm telling
[2:05:50] you he lays it out like a man with an
[2:05:52] education
[2:05:54] and he had no had no education now
[2:05:57] Matthew chapter 6 I'll hurry I don't
[2:05:59] know why I've got another hour
[2:06:01] Matthew chapter 6 verse 31 therefore
[2:06:04] take no thought saying what shall we eat
[2:06:07] or what shall we drink or wherewithal
[2:06:10] shall we be clothed
[2:06:12] hmm
[2:06:14] all that flirting and worrying we do
[2:06:17] over where we're gonna go eat
[2:06:19] [Music]
[2:06:23] and the Bible said don't even worry
[2:06:25] about it
[2:06:28] just just go
[2:06:31] husbands and wives
[2:06:33] nearly filed papers
[2:06:36] over trying to decide where to go eat
[2:06:38] just go just go eat
[2:06:40] don't let that torment you
[2:06:42] if you miss the sale at Old Navy don't
[2:06:45] worry about it
[2:06:46] God's not gonna let you be naked
[2:06:50] if you find out your clothes come from
[2:06:52] China wear them anyhow
[2:06:55] somebody said they're full of chemicals
[2:06:56] they're going to kill us God will take
[2:06:57] care of you
[2:06:59] just wash them real good and come on
[2:07:01] don't get so caught up
[2:07:06] I said to I said to Jennifer and Josiah
[2:07:09] last Sunday because their Lord have
[2:07:12] mercy
[2:07:16] they said to said to me like well you
[2:07:18] know this all this strain of making
[2:07:20] these choices sit just just kind of
[2:07:22] Genesis put a little strain on us I said
[2:07:24] well of course it does
[2:07:27] it did all the rest of us too
[2:07:30] it seemed like that helped her so much
[2:07:34] maybe if I had some time I could sit
[2:07:36] down and tell her and and Josiah what
[2:07:39] I've been through with some of your
[2:07:40] weddings
[2:07:47] I honestly wanted some of you just I
[2:07:49] just wanted to put the broom out there
[2:07:50] and tell you to jump it let's just jump
[2:07:52] over the broom in Jesus name amen
[2:07:59] do we get so carried away so worried I
[2:08:01] don't mean your day shouldn't be amazing
[2:08:03] your your wedding day should be amazing
[2:08:06] but we get so carried away so caught up
[2:08:10] families get so divided
[2:08:12] everybody has an opinion you all would
[2:08:15] have made wonderful Jews
[2:08:18] everybody has an opinion
[2:08:21] they don't ever ever give it when it's
[2:08:24] needed
[2:08:27] only when it's unsolicited
[2:08:31] do they start popping in even men become

[2:10:57] flaws of the modern day Church

[2:12:49] in the church has to sing a song
[2:12:51] everybody has to sing a song
[2:12:54] everybody everybody has to sing a song
[2:12:56] just about every service everybody has
[2:12:59] to sing a song
[2:13:01] that's a concert
[2:13:04] nothing wrong with having a concert
[2:13:06] we can have a concert sometime we can
[2:13:08] have a sing sometime we can have
[2:13:10] everybody come and sing two or three
[2:13:12] songs and hear everybody sing a song we
[2:13:14] can come for that purpose but that's not
[2:13:16] why we came this morning
[2:13:19] I want to hear from you I want to hear
[2:13:20] your songs if you you tell us you've got
[2:13:22] a song to sing we're most likely going
[2:13:24] to hear it
[2:13:25] we love it I love when people sing Under
[2:13:28] The anointing
[2:13:29] but I know churches for everybody and
[2:13:31] his brother and sisters got to sing
[2:13:33] whether they can or not
[2:13:36] but I can't worry about that
[2:13:39] let them do it
[2:13:41] I know churches where the church age
[2:13:43] book is the most sacred book they carry
[2:13:46] it around with their Bible like it's
[2:13:47] like it's you know gold or something I
[2:13:51] don't care
[2:13:53] I can't put my eyes on the church
[2:13:57] hello God keep my eyes on the kingdom
[2:14:00] can't spend all my Ministry preaching
[2:14:02] against them
[2:14:04] [Music]
[2:14:06] I gotta lead you to the rapture
[2:14:08] we got to move together toward the
[2:14:10] kingdom hello
[2:14:13] so many trinitarian churches out there
[2:14:16] can't help it
[2:14:18] can't spend all my time preaching
[2:14:19] against trinitarian churches
[2:14:23] they're going to be there always will be
[2:14:25] there
[2:14:27] yes
[2:14:28] they wear ball caps to church
[2:14:33] cargo shorts
[2:14:35] [Music]
[2:14:38] miniskirts
[2:14:41] can't help it
[2:14:43] can't help what they do that's what they
[2:14:45] do we know it we see it we hear it
[2:14:49] they bring their Starbucks right into
[2:14:51] the sanctuary with them
[2:14:54] they're ready to have church
[2:14:57] women in tight slacks prophesy
[2:15:02] air bobs
[2:15:04] painted up
[2:15:09] to me some of the ugliest women in the
[2:15:11] world are former Holiness women
[2:15:15] because once they get free
[2:15:18] they look like clowns
[2:15:22] clowns they just paint up they just
[2:15:24] don't know where to stop they're not
[2:15:26] just putting on a layer of color they're
[2:15:28] putting on everything
[2:15:30] nobody's lips are way out here
[2:15:34] but that is what the church does how am
[2:15:37] I going to help you
[2:15:39] by spending all my time
[2:15:42] talking about what the churches do
[2:15:47] John couldn't see the kingdom
[2:15:50] in its fullness and understand it until
[2:15:52] first God took him back to the churches
[2:15:54] we've been to the church ages how many
[2:15:56] of you been through the church ages
[2:15:57] we've heard it we've been in this thing
[2:15:59] a long time we know how that spirit
[2:16:01] moves we know how that trail of the
[2:16:03] serpent moved through the church ages we
[2:16:05] understand that we know how we
[2:16:07] understand the seals now we see how the
[2:16:09] horse riders changed
[2:16:11] we see how the church was preaching that
[2:16:14] that the first seal was Jesus Christ and
[2:16:16] we come to find out it's not Jesus
[2:16:18] Christ in the first seal it's the
[2:16:20] Antichrist
[2:16:22] you'd think that makes a little bit of
[2:16:23] difference
[2:16:25] if we're preaching all day that that's
[2:16:27] Christ and come to find out it's the
[2:16:29] Antichrist so look get your eyes off the
[2:16:32] church ages
[2:16:33] [Applause]
[2:16:34] I'm coming home in just a minute
[2:16:39] you believe me
[2:16:41] you got to see the kingdom
[2:16:44] now let's come on down to our church
[2:16:45] anybody want to spend some time here
[2:16:47] just a moment
[2:16:48] let's come down to our church
[2:16:50] we got flaws
[2:16:54] you be careful how you amen
[2:16:59] because these are my youngins
[2:17:01] and you know how mamas and daddies are
[2:17:03] about their youngins
[2:17:04] I know they have flaws
[2:17:07] I know they I know they need a spanking
[2:17:10] a gospel whipping at least once a week I
[2:17:13] know these people but you be careful how
[2:17:15] you amen
[2:17:17] because these are my children understand
[2:17:19] what I'm trying to tell you
[2:17:23] I can say what I need to say to him
[2:17:26] but you be careful
[2:17:28] are you with me
[2:17:29] you look around this church you'll see
[2:17:31] that there are people that don't always
[2:17:33] keep the standard
[2:17:38] you'll see there are women who need a
[2:17:39] little more material
[2:17:41] men who need a little more cloth
[2:17:46] some strange things people do with their
[2:17:48] hair sometimes
[2:17:50] chemical
[2:17:52] infusion perms or whatever the some of
[2:17:56] some of the stuff the world does
[2:17:59] every now and again I see a
[2:18:02] somebody with a clear polish
[2:18:04] on their nails and
[2:18:09] I see some of the girls start off with a
[2:18:11] thread around their
[2:18:13] wrist is some little meaning some little
[2:18:16] meaning in the next thing you know it it
[2:18:18] begins to look more and more like
[2:18:19] jewelry
[2:18:23] see all that
[2:18:24] but I I compel you in the name of the
[2:18:27] Lord to get your eyes off the church
[2:18:33] because you are not the one called
[2:18:36] to set the church where it needs to set
[2:18:39] you get your eyes on the kingdom
[2:18:46] you can't do your job in my job too
[2:18:49] you can't do your job in brother
[2:18:51] Greeley's job too you can only do your
[2:18:53] job
[2:18:54] you get your eyes on him
[2:18:59] I said well I think that one may have a
[2:19:00] spirit on them you're probably right
[2:19:03] but if you go around looking for who's
[2:19:05] got a spirit on them you're you're
[2:19:07] constantly looking over your shoulder
[2:19:12] you're not looking at the Kingdom
[2:19:15] preach brother
[2:19:16] [Music]
[2:19:17] preach brother
[2:19:19] now why are you even preaching this
[2:19:21] because I'm preaching on ask abundantly
[2:19:24] oh let me let me get on that because
[2:19:26] sometimes people say I don't think the
[2:19:28] children ought to run around like that
[2:19:32] why why you you let them run bloody
[2:19:37] murder everywhere they go
[2:19:43] come on brother
[2:19:46] well I don't think you see those kids
[2:19:49] run up there and uh one hug the pastor
[2:19:52] or brother Greely or whatever after the
[2:19:54] survey why does that bother you
[2:19:56] [Music]
[2:19:59] if somebody if one of these children
[2:20:01] wants to call me Pap Pap what is that to
[2:20:03] you
[2:20:04] [Music]
[2:20:08] oh it's quiet ain't it you think I'm
[2:20:10] being ugly and I'm really I'm not even
[2:20:12] nearer I'm not near as serious as you
[2:20:14] think I am but I am but I can tell by
[2:20:17] the look on your face that you think I
[2:20:19] think that I'm really straightening it
[2:20:21] out and that ain't even what I'm getting
[2:20:23] to
[2:20:24] oh I love it this way
[2:20:27] I love it when you think I'm madder than
[2:20:29] I am
[2:20:31] I'm just I'm I'm getting to something
[2:20:35] I'm getting this I I'm getting there
[2:20:43] brother Austin said well let's hear it
[2:20:45] I'm getting there
[2:20:49] I'm on my way
[2:20:52] it takes some of us longer to get there
[2:20:54] than it does others but I'm headed there
[2:20:56] I want you to be able to ask abundantly
[2:21:00] I want you to be able to get what you
[2:21:03] ask
[2:21:03] I want you to see that God does not want
[2:21:06] to live in a little limited box
[2:21:09] I want you to be able to have what you
[2:21:11] pray I want you to begin to see the
[2:21:14] answer to your prayers and I want to
[2:21:16] tell you that you can't as long as
[2:21:18] you're looking at the church
[2:21:21] John couldn't hear what he'd had to hear
[2:21:23] on Patmos if he would have only been
[2:21:26] looking
[2:21:27] somewhere God wasn't talking
[2:21:30] God wasn't Kingdom talking yet
[2:21:32] he was church talking
[2:21:34] so John had to turn to see the church
[2:21:37] the message of the Hour come
[2:21:40] we saw the church
[2:21:42] now it's time to see the kingdom
[2:21:45] anybody with me so
[2:21:48] here's the three steps to overcoming
[2:21:54] keep your eyes on Jesus and off of
[2:21:57] everybody else
[2:21:59] keep your eyes on Jesus off of everybody
[2:22:02] else
[2:22:03] keep your eyes on Jesus off of everybody
[2:22:05] else
[2:22:06] don't you spend time looking at the
[2:22:10] church is flawed
[2:22:12] do you know why because there's flawed
[2:22:15] people here do you know why because
[2:22:17] there's a flawed Pastor here
[2:22:22] we are human
[2:22:24] and we don't always do it right
[2:22:30] you go out of here Sunday I don't do I
[2:22:32] don't think we ought to call off for
[2:22:34] service for Fourth of July it's a good
[2:22:36] thing you're not making the decisions
[2:22:38] we didn't have an election we didn't
[2:22:40] take a vote
[2:22:41] we did what we felt like we ought to do
[2:22:43] why do you let that bother you why would
[2:22:45] you even Grumble about it why would you
[2:22:47] even repeat it why would you even let it
[2:22:50] be a bother to you get your eyes off the
[2:22:52] church
[2:22:55] you need to see the kingdom
[2:22:58] Church Ages come seals come now we can
[2:23:01] see the kingdom of God and if we see the
[2:23:04] kingdom of God we can ask what we will
[2:23:09] and it shall be done
[2:23:11] our prayers are often hindered by what
[2:23:15] we look at
[2:23:16] let me preach on the television
[2:23:19] let me preach on the filth and the slop
[2:23:21] and the garbage and the pornography and
[2:23:23] and the sports that eats Us Alive with
[2:23:26] their filth commercial so full of Filth
[2:23:30] you feed on that you if you constantly
[2:23:33] look you are on here look this there's a
[2:23:36] woman on my road God bless her heart
[2:23:39] brother Greely has seen her
[2:23:42] she's an older lady not old but
[2:23:45] slightly older than me and she likes to
[2:23:48] walk at least she's walking
[2:23:51] I told her kids coming at least she's
[2:23:52] moving a lot of people her age are
[2:23:55] playing games on their phone on the
[2:23:56] couch
[2:23:57] at least she's walking up the road
[2:23:59] but it doesn't make a lot of sense to
[2:24:01] walk up the road where cars
[2:24:04] Zoom around play in a game
[2:24:16] because one of these days Ben will come
[2:24:18] by our brother Greeley for that matter
[2:24:23] or Zach
[2:24:25] and run them in the ditch run her off in
[2:24:27] the ditch
[2:24:29] because you're not constantly expecting
[2:24:31] somebody to be out there
[2:24:34] she needs to look up one day I'm up and
[2:24:36] rolled the window down and say mama
[2:24:41] I don't want you to be a hood ornament
[2:24:43] on my Ford
[2:24:46] people get
[2:24:54] we used to say they're drunk
[2:24:57] now we say they're on the phone
[2:24:59] hello distraction distraction
[2:25:02] distraction distraction it'll lead us
[2:25:05] alive
[2:25:06] it'll steal our joy it'll cause us to
[2:25:09] look back to the church ages
[2:25:14] it doesn't mean we're not going to teach
[2:25:15] the truth of the church ages it means
[2:25:17] we've been there we've done that we
[2:25:19] can't look at that all the time the
[2:25:22] church out there is corrupt the church
[2:25:24] in here is not pure
[2:25:26] because we're working toward Perfection
[2:25:29] get your eyes off of each other
[2:25:33] get your eyes off of your pastor
[2:25:37] and see Jesus see the kingdom
[2:25:51] verse 33 but seek ye first
[2:25:57] seek ye first
[2:26:01] no
[2:26:04] seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[2:26:09] righteousness and all these things shall
[2:26:14] be added unto you
[2:26:16] that word seek there you're still with
[2:26:18] me do I have a few more minutes
[2:26:22] [Laughter]
[2:26:23] God bless you brother cephas
[2:26:26] I don't know you particular brother but
[2:26:28] he said I've been listening to Pastor
[2:26:30] Shelley since the 90s
[2:26:32] nice to see he's still holding on God
[2:26:34] bless you sir I am by the grace of God
[2:26:38] and when I can't hold on he holds on
[2:26:42] isn't that it
[2:26:44] came first
[2:26:46] that word
[2:26:51] it means to look for to be passionate
[2:26:55] about it means to be consumed with
[2:26:58] finding
[2:27:00] do you know what would happen to this
[2:27:01] body of Believers if if half of us if a
[2:27:05] third of us would leave with a
[2:27:07] determination to be consumed with
[2:27:10] finding the kingdom
[2:27:11] [Applause]
[2:27:17] quit looking at that crazy uncle of
[2:27:19] yours
[2:27:23] he's always going to be your uncle
[2:27:25] he's probably always going to be crazy
[2:27:28] passionately seek the kingdom
[2:27:31] that's what I'm saying
[2:27:33] get your eyes off of the church families
[2:27:35] that don't do just like you want them to
[2:27:37] do and
[2:27:38] you know and they look at you funny I I
[2:27:40] tell you the next person who tells me
[2:27:45] I wasn't mad while ago but I'm about to
[2:27:47] feel mad right now
[2:27:51] he looked at me funny
[2:27:56] you big crybaby
[2:28:00] I'm being honest what are you for
[2:28:07] preach brother
[2:28:10] you are funny sometime
[2:28:12] no wonder somebody looked at you funny
[2:28:19] I passed my pastor and he didn't even
[2:28:21] wave at me in the car that's because I
[2:28:24] didn't see you
[2:28:26] I don't even know what you drive
[2:28:32] ask my wife ask my children I don't even
[2:28:35] know what you people drive I drive up
[2:28:39] here on Sunday and I'll say well whose
[2:28:41] car is that Ben's
[2:28:47] I don't I don't
[2:28:49] I know that you got here I'm thankful
[2:28:51] that you had a way to get here
[2:28:54] I I'm sorry Luke
[2:28:56] I know what you drive
[2:28:59] so if you ain't Luke
[2:29:02] I ain't looking
[2:29:06] I'm having too much fun Lord help me
[2:29:11] when Luke pulls in with that 18-wheeler
[2:29:13] you can't miss him
[2:29:20] grow up
[2:29:23] grow up
[2:29:25] he may have looked at you funny cause
[2:29:27] he's going through something
[2:29:30] he might have looked right through you
[2:29:33] he may not have even been looking at you
[2:29:35] she may have been looking through you
[2:29:40] grow up seek the kingdom of God if a
[2:29:44] third of us would go out of here seeking
[2:29:47] passionately to operate in the Kingdom
[2:29:52] in righteousness in joy in peace
[2:29:56] in the Holy Ghost In Loving kindness
[2:30:01] Temperance and patience and godliness
[2:30:04] come on if we would passionately seek to
[2:30:08] operate in the Kingdom
[2:30:10] instead of operating the flesh or
[2:30:13] operate in the church ages
[2:30:18] some of the stuff that God tolerated in
[2:30:21] the church ages he will not tolerate in
[2:30:23] the kingdom and I think some of us know
[2:30:26] that
[2:30:27] and that's why we don't have that
[2:30:29] passion
[2:30:31] I don't want to have prayer lines until
[2:30:34] the rapture
[2:30:36] [Music]
[2:30:41] so I got a few more minutes I'm taking
[2:30:43] them
[2:30:45] when we did prayer lines in the 90s
[2:30:49] we were criticized
[2:30:53] and now they have one at least in every
[2:30:55] meeting
[2:30:56] thrilled
[2:30:58] I'm thrilled the only thing I want to
[2:30:59] know is this
[2:31:01] they told us then
[2:31:03] that we were Beyond them
[2:31:08] when when is somebody going to say oops
[2:31:14] I'm waiting on a letter don't you think
[2:31:16] I'm waiting not I'm looking I'm looking
[2:31:18] at the Kingdom
[2:31:20] but I'm waiting on a letter
[2:31:22] to say you know brother Shelley we
[2:31:24] really took you to task because you had
[2:31:25] prayer lines
[2:31:27] criticized because we let sisters pray
[2:31:30] for sisters
[2:31:35] it is ridiculous there's neither male
[2:31:37] nor female with God
[2:31:39] it's not a woman's place to handle the
[2:31:41] word
[2:31:41] she has every right to every spiritual
[2:31:43] gift except handling the word
[2:31:48] all these things and now there's at
[2:31:51] least one prayer line to end every
[2:31:53] meeting which I think is wonderful and
[2:31:55] here's what's so funny is I'm coming
[2:31:57] along here on a Sunday morning and I'm
[2:31:59] telling you I don't want to have prayer
[2:32:01] lines
[2:32:02] until the rapture
[2:32:06] I don't want to leave here so tired I
[2:32:08] can't hardly get out of the chair the
[2:32:10] rest of the day
[2:32:12] I want to go and we haven't had a prayer
[2:32:14] line in a while so I'm not talking about
[2:32:15] that it's the pull of the word that
[2:32:17] wears me out sometime
[2:32:19] or or put it's either one or two things
[2:32:21] either the word pulling me or you or me
[2:32:24] pulling you
[2:32:27] but I leave here pretty tired
[2:32:30] but here's what I'm trying to say we
[2:32:32] won't always need a per line
[2:32:34] we're looking at the Kingdom
[2:32:37] I hope you don't criticize me for saying
[2:32:39] that prayer lines are Church ages
[2:32:46] you know somebody said well uh we need
[2:32:49] the altars you know the new churches
[2:32:51] they're building they're not even
[2:32:52] putting an altar there I said well I'm
[2:32:53] not I mean I think there should be an
[2:32:55] altar but I'm not really going to
[2:32:56] criticize that because we don't use the
[2:32:58] ones we have much
[2:33:03] but it's not a piece of furniture that
[2:33:05] we need to preach back in the church
[2:33:08] I could cause I could do a Blog I think
[2:33:10] I'll do a Blog on putting the altar back
[2:33:12] in the church
[2:33:13] what would be the good in getting
[2:33:15] somebody to bring a piece of furniture
[2:33:17] back when we're no longer in the church
[2:33:19] ages anyway
[2:33:22] we're moving beyond now we're so close
[2:33:25] to the kingdom
[2:33:27] that that Veil gets thin sometime and we
[2:33:30] start tasting of the power of the ages
[2:33:32] to come
[2:33:35] whoa
[2:33:39] and when that breaks out Among Us you
[2:33:42] won't have to get down here on your
[2:33:43] knees and crawl and big and plead and
[2:33:46] you won't have to line up out the back
[2:33:47] door for the preacher to pray for you
[2:33:49] Hallelujah you'll sit under the anointed
[2:33:51] word of God and receive your miracles
[2:33:54] [Music]
[2:33:56] but we'll never be there if all we do is
[2:34:00] look at the church
[2:34:02] either the false church or The Universal
[2:34:05] Church that will be redeemed or our
[2:34:08] church
[2:34:12] every church has got its
[2:34:18] pimples and
[2:34:22] hiccups and crooked noses and
[2:34:26] quit looking at them
[2:34:33] you're still at this stage worried that
[2:34:35] there might be some services that I
[2:34:37] don't come out and shake hands
[2:34:42] when I feel like I've drugged people for
[2:34:44] two hours
[2:34:45] I'm you're heavy sometime
[2:34:49] and and you know maybe maybe before 50 I
[2:34:52] didn't have to go to the bathroom for
[2:34:53] several hours
[2:34:55] but at this point
[2:34:58] by the last I mean I could go right now
[2:35:03] by the time the last amen is said
[2:35:06] I need to go
[2:35:08] and what do you think it feels like as I
[2:35:10] go out there out of the room sometime
[2:35:12] I'm coming back a lot of the time I'm
[2:35:13] coming back and you're calling me
[2:35:15] brother Shelley brother Shelley brother
[2:35:16] Shelley brother Shelly by the Shelley
[2:35:17] and I'm thinking oh my if I could just
[2:35:23] you know maybe maybe I should look into
[2:35:25] a catheter or something I don't know
[2:35:28] for long Sundays
[2:35:32] don't get somebody am I offending you
[2:35:36] wow all of a sudden I caught a few
[2:35:38] people that look like I've just crossed
[2:35:39] the line
[2:35:41] you ain't seen nothing
[2:35:45] this is sanitized
[2:35:49] why would it matter Why doesn't
[2:35:55] search don't look at each other don't
[2:35:58] look at what the church out there is
[2:36:00] doing and get word about it don't
[2:36:02] compare your church to somebody else's
[2:36:04] church because we got our own share of
[2:36:07] flaws
[2:36:09] there is no one right Church
[2:36:13] it's not a building it's not a local
[2:36:16] congregation it's bigger than that
[2:36:19] it's Kingdom
[2:36:22] and in the Kingdom as we begin to Break
[2:36:25] Forth in the kingdom of God we don't
[2:36:28] have to cry
[2:36:32] we don't have to beat the Rock again
[2:36:35] we speak to the Rock and the water comes
[2:36:38] we don't cry we speak
[2:36:41] but until then
[2:36:43] until then
[2:36:45] we ought to be crying
[2:36:47] I need a few more minutes thank you
[2:36:49] God commissioning Moses
[2:36:51] I am on Page Three I thought well I'll
[2:36:54] do so good my family will be so proud of
[2:36:57] me I only have 12 pages
[2:36:59] and I'll be done I'll be done early
[2:37:02] and uh and I've talked about everything
[2:37:04] but what I should talk about probably is
[2:37:07] you're thinking
[2:37:09] I'm just giving you an example I'm just
[2:37:11] helping you to see
[2:37:14] don't be scared to ask
[2:37:23] don't be afraid to shout
[2:37:26] don't be afraid to dance
[2:37:28] just make sure you're living right
[2:37:33] that's a fair ask isn't it
[2:37:37] you have not you have not
[2:37:42] because you ask not
[2:37:45] that's just what the word said
[2:37:47] but listen what brother random said
[2:37:50] he said you ask not
[2:37:54] because you believe not
[2:37:57] you don't ask because you don't believe
[2:38:00] if you believe you'll ask
[2:38:02] and you won't ask meagerly
[2:38:06] you'll ask abundantly
[2:38:09] amen
[2:38:16] Brother David can I use your little
[2:38:18] thing as an example
[2:38:22] Brother David had a hard thing I won't
[2:38:24] go into detail every detail of it but
[2:38:25] Brother David had a hard thing recently
[2:38:28] found out
[2:38:29] that he was
[2:38:31] let me see how to say it nice
[2:38:33] he was not being paid what he was worth
[2:38:35] he knew that all along
[2:38:38] but sometimes you swallow it because you
[2:38:41] you understand that everybody's trying
[2:38:43] to do what they can to get by and
[2:38:45] whatever else but when you start finding
[2:38:46] out that you're you're below new hire
[2:38:49] is that ugly to say is that too much
[2:38:51] information
[2:38:53] when you find out that you're faithful
[2:38:55] you have a harder job than most
[2:38:58] and you're below new hire
[2:39:01] you you you can do a lot you can stomp
[2:39:03] in and quit
[2:39:06] get mad
[2:39:08] or you can ask
[2:39:14] sister Sandy reached out and she said I
[2:39:16] want to know about them anointed rocks
[2:39:18] you were talking about
[2:39:19] he said where do we put them I loved
[2:39:21] that
[2:39:23] but God was already on the case
[2:39:27] Brother David just wrote a letter and
[2:39:28] asked
[2:39:30] I read the letter
[2:39:32] he may not know it did you send it to me
[2:39:34] sister Sandy I read the letter I thought
[2:39:37] it was amazing I thought it was so well
[2:39:39] done
[2:39:40] not not a why me I'm mistreated no no no
[2:39:45] very professional
[2:39:49] when can we meet to talk about this
[2:39:51] oh I love it
[2:39:55] I don't know the details now I've been
[2:39:58] out of touch with the details all I know
[2:40:00] is I got a text he said I got a raise
[2:40:05] [Applause]
[2:40:08] it works in the natural
[2:40:10] many times
[2:40:12] it always works in the spiritual
[2:40:14] ask
[2:40:16] don't be scared to ask
[2:40:19] there are people in this room that have
[2:40:21] been afraid to do what he did I'm not
[2:40:23] lifting him up putting you down I'm
[2:40:25] telling you it pays to get a little
[2:40:27] boldness sometimes do it in the right
[2:40:29] spirit
[2:40:30] I admire him for it don't be scared to
[2:40:34] ask ask abundantly you have not because
[2:40:36] you're astronaut you ask not because you
[2:40:38] believe not
[2:40:40] ask a whole lot
[2:40:41] God will give you a whole lot
[2:40:44] have a lot of faith
[2:40:46] a fella told me the other day he said he
[2:40:48] was riding in an old Model T Ford yet
[2:40:51] said one day happened to get some good
[2:40:53] faith and God gave him a Buick
[2:40:58] he said I got a Buick faith I'm praying
[2:41:03] for Cadillac faith
[2:41:06] now how many of you would condemn that
[2:41:11] as charismatic
[2:41:13] name it and claim it
[2:41:15] hello
[2:41:20] a lot of people would
[2:41:22] and you remember the old Ford that
[2:41:23] brother Branham drove that wasn't his
[2:41:25] only vehicle you know don't you you do
[2:41:28] know he had a Cadillac don't you
[2:41:33] and does anybody care
[2:41:38] I could care less
[2:41:41] he could have had one for both legs and
[2:41:43] I wouldn't have cared
[2:41:46] do you understand what I'm saying
[2:41:48] don't you get some critical spirit on
[2:41:50] you because you can't keep yours running
[2:41:57] somebody said what does anybody need a
[2:41:59] Cadillac I don't know if they need it or
[2:42:01] not
[2:42:05] but I'll tell you the vehicle I drive
[2:42:07] cost exactly exactly what Cadillacs did
[2:42:10] about 10 15 20 years ago
[2:42:15] listen to what brother Graham said about
[2:42:17] the man moving from Model T to Buick
[2:42:19] Faith to Cadillac Faith he said all
[2:42:21] right that's good
[2:42:24] that's right
[2:42:25] keep on
[2:42:29] it's so quiet
[2:42:32] I love this
[2:42:34] as we all go out of here in our foreign
[2:42:36] made little cars
[2:42:41] God will give it he's gotten forward
[2:42:43] faith
[2:42:45] so stay with the Ford then yes
[2:42:52] laughs
[2:42:54] come on
[2:42:59] I may not have the hat and I may not
[2:43:01] have the belt buckle but I drive the
[2:43:02] Ford
[2:43:07] no he said let's get a little more faith
[2:43:12] he's telling you not to stay with
[2:43:13] forward faith
[2:43:16] have faith for what you want
[2:43:21] you ought to be ashamed of yourself for
[2:43:23] wanting more than what you've got that's
[2:43:26] false Doctrine
[2:43:28] I'm going to give you the truth of that
[2:43:30] you ought to be ashamed of yourself for
[2:43:32] wanting more than what you've got when
[2:43:34] you refuse to look at the right thing
[2:43:39] God's not going to give you better when
[2:43:41] you criticize everybody around you
[2:43:48] I may not know what people drive but I
[2:43:50] guarantee you there's people in this
[2:43:51] church that know what people drive
[2:43:53] and what they paid for it because they
[2:43:55] Googled it and blue booked it and looked
[2:43:57] it up and
[2:43:58] hello
[2:44:00] what does it matter
[2:44:02] get your eyes off of that
[2:44:06] then you've got some people that have
[2:44:07] got a new vehicle and don't even want to
[2:44:09] drive it around Church Folks
[2:44:11] because they feel they feel that someone
[2:44:13] might say something about it I pray in
[2:44:16] the name of the Lord that you will not
[2:44:17] have your eyes on each other like that
[2:44:27] I feel something good here today
[2:44:30] I'm being rough with the visitors here I
[2:44:32] shouldn't preach like this I ought to be
[2:44:34] on my best behavior with visitors here
[2:44:38] hold on to it he said he's got forward
[2:44:41] Faith just stay with the Ford then
[2:44:42] that's all right let's get a little more
[2:44:44] faith all right that's what brother
[2:44:45] random's telling us
[2:44:47] now in a message where I think Pentecost
[2:44:49] failed let's go there quickly oh
[2:44:52] the time the time the time
[2:44:57] and God will never you can never exhaust
[2:45:00] God's love and mercy to you you say well
[2:45:03] I hate to bother you so much father
[2:45:05] I'll be honest with you I don't pray I
[2:45:07] don't say that
[2:45:11] I never tell the Lord It's Me Again I
[2:45:14] know you're tired of hearing from me
[2:45:18] because I have a revelation
[2:45:21] you see to me that's really false
[2:45:23] humility that's not based on faith it's
[2:45:25] based on Pride
[2:45:28] you don't have to come to God like oh I
[2:45:31] know you're tired of seeing me
[2:45:35] he wants to be bothered that way
[2:45:40] he does don't never think that you could
[2:45:43] ever ask too much of God
[2:45:47] he said I believe the scripture said you
[2:45:49] have not because you ask not you asked
[2:45:52] not because you believe not
[2:45:54] he wants us to ask and believe that our
[2:45:57] Joys would be full he wants you to ask
[2:45:59] abundantly ask for big things don't
[2:46:02] limit your faith to some little Mustard
[2:46:04] Seed get on out here to some other kind
[2:46:06] of faith and move out in big things now
[2:46:10] remember remember
[2:46:11] if you've got your eyes on this world
[2:46:17] you'll be struggling over here between
[2:46:19] Buick faith and forward faith
[2:46:23] but when you get your eyes on the
[2:46:25] kingdom
[2:46:27] your asks will change
[2:46:34] it'll change it'll change what you ask
[2:46:36] for
[2:46:40] ask big things big things is just as
[2:46:42] easy to receive in little things you
[2:46:44] just have to believe that's all and
[2:46:46] you've got faith just know exactly how
[2:46:48] to use it and it'll be all right you can
[2:46:50] put it right to work and it'll just
[2:46:52] it'll just be fine could you imagine
[2:46:54] talking about exhausting God's love and
[2:46:57] power and beneficiaries for you could
[2:47:00] you imagine a little bitty fishy about
[2:47:02] that long way out here in the middle of
[2:47:04] the ocean say now wait a minute I better
[2:47:05] consider this thing I better drink of
[2:47:07] this water sparingly
[2:47:09] uh
[2:47:11] wow
[2:47:13] how many little minutes how many little
[2:47:15] minnows are in here
[2:47:17] they get that kind of mentality
[2:47:19] well I better be careful you know I
[2:47:25] I don't want to drink too much
[2:47:28] to me it's like those same naysayers you
[2:47:31] know
[2:47:32] you better be careful how excited you
[2:47:34] get you better be careful how emotional
[2:47:36] you get you're very careful because you
[2:47:38] don't want to run out one day or
[2:47:39] something like that
[2:47:40] like that little fish way out there in
[2:47:43] the middle of the ocean say now wait a
[2:47:44] minute I better consider this thing I
[2:47:45] better drink of this water sparingly
[2:47:47] because I might run out someday a little
[2:47:49] fish about that big in the middle of
[2:47:50] this ocean out here
[2:47:51] well that could get that could easily be
[2:47:54] done more easier than you could ask too
[2:47:56] much of God it'd be easier for the
[2:47:58] little bitty fish
[2:48:00] to drink all the water in the ocean
[2:48:02] then for you to ask too much of God
[2:48:07] that is good he's the inexhaustible
[2:48:10] Fountain of Life would you say that with
[2:48:12] me he's the inexhaustible Fountain of
[2:48:15] Life inexhaustible it just keeps on
[2:48:17] pouring
[2:48:19] whatever you have need of ask him and
[2:48:22] believe it your asks will change
[2:48:24] when you're looking at the Kingdom
[2:48:31] when you're looking at the Kingdom
[2:48:32] you're more concerned about what pleases
[2:48:34] him
[2:48:36] then you are what pleases you
[2:48:38] when you're looking at the Kingdom
[2:48:40] you're more concerned about what how God
[2:48:42] wants to use that situation
[2:48:46] than telling God how you want the
[2:48:48] situation to be
[2:48:50] if you're if you will understand that we
[2:48:53] ask God what we want what we hope for
[2:48:55] what we'd like to be but we've got to
[2:48:57] have an attitude toward him Lord you
[2:48:59] know best father you know best father
[2:49:01] you know best I'm asking I'm asking for
[2:49:03] this but I what I really want is what
[2:49:06] pleases you
[2:49:09] so do you think do you think it's wrong
[2:49:11] to ask abundantly
[2:49:14] not according to the word
[2:49:17] you can preface you can you can add an
[2:49:20] addendum the end of that you can do
[2:49:21] however you want to but Lord what I
[2:49:23] really want is to please you
[2:49:28] and here's something else to add in
[2:49:30] there I'm going to praise you
[2:49:33] for the Buick just like I'd praise you
[2:49:35] for the forges like I'd pray you
[2:49:37] together I'm going to say every good
[2:49:38] thing comes from you
[2:49:39] [Applause]
[2:49:43] thank you I don't want you to miss what
[2:49:45] I've been preaching this morning I'm I'm
[2:49:47] wondering if I've got too off track and
[2:49:49] you're you're going to miss it I hope
[2:49:50] not he provided it in the redempted
[2:49:53] blessings when he died at Calvary gave a

[2:51:22] goodness come on musicians would you
[2:51:25] he's the inexhaustible Fountain of Life
[2:51:27] that you cannot exhaust his goodness
[2:51:29] some people think oh I hate to call on

[2:51:33] read that for me
[2:51:37] that's what he wants you to do
[2:51:41] you have not because you asked not
[2:51:44] you ask not because you believe not

[2:51:54] toddlers
[2:51:57] you have not because you asked not you

[2:52:01] abundantly that your Joys might be full
[2:52:03] that's what God wants ask big things
[2:52:07] he said I'm asking for hundreds of souls
[2:52:09] in this meeting he's seeing the kingdom
[2:52:12] he's seeing the kingdom
[2:52:16] you know why we don't do you know why
[2:52:18] there's only a few of us when we say
[2:52:20] when we say something like uh we're
[2:52:23] believing this mortgage is going to be
[2:52:24] paid off by the end of the year you know
[2:52:26] why there's only a few people that say
[2:52:28] Man
[2:52:29] come on
[2:52:32] because you've already accepted the
[2:52:34] alternative
[2:52:38] yes
[2:52:41] well I just hate to see him brother
[2:52:43] shelling brother Greeley disappointed
[2:52:49] sail your cow
[2:52:53] sell your Cadillac
[2:52:57] if you really don't want to see us
[2:52:58] disappointed
[2:53:03] I can't believe I just said that I mean
[2:53:06] I have I've just I've just thrown all my
[2:53:08] decorum away
[2:53:10] I sound like a money preacher
[2:53:12] no you
[2:53:18] don't use it is scary
[2:53:25] no it's scary I'm not going to agree
[2:53:26] with you it's scary
[2:53:35] no I wasn't scared three years ago
[2:53:40] I can't I don't see the new the new
[2:53:42] balance
[2:53:46] foreign
[2:53:48] may have just you may have read it off
[2:53:50] it's one one it's less than one
[2:53:54] what is it
[2:53:57] 147
[2:53:59] 000.
[2:54:01] 323
[2:54:03] divide 147 000 by six months
[2:54:13] no wonder you don't say Amen
[2:54:16] how much
[2:54:18] a month
[2:54:20] does that look impossible
[2:54:30] we're not looking at it
[2:54:33] we're looking to him
[2:54:36] you don't have to not amen because
[2:54:39] you're afraid that if if something
[2:54:40] should have
[2:54:43] revealed and God should say uh I'm going
[2:54:46] to do something a little different but
[2:54:48] but it's coming and it'll be you know I
[2:54:50] don't want you to worry about our faith
[2:54:52] I don't want you to worry about what
[2:54:53] we're going to give up and quit and shut
[2:54:54] the church down I don't want you to
[2:54:56] worry about me being disappointed in God
[2:55:00] I want you to understand that the right
[2:55:03] approach is to always ask and believe
[2:55:07] that he is able to do exceeding
[2:55:10] abundantly above
[2:55:13] what we can even ask or think
[2:55:18] we want his perfect will we want his
[2:55:21] perfect plan we want his perfect timing
[2:55:26] but it's all right to believe
[2:55:33] that's what God wants ask big things
[2:55:35] he said I'm asking for hundreds of souls
[2:55:37] in this meeting I'm asking that every
[2:55:39] sick person enters that door will go out
[2:55:41] of here well that's a big one
[2:55:44] why not
[2:55:45] that's what you can ask when you're
[2:55:47] looking at the Kingdom
[2:55:50] I'm believing it I'm believing that till
[2:55:52] we go that this won't be another
[2:55:54] gathering together but it'll be a
[2:55:56] Revival in Yakima here
[2:55:58] Satan's kept me out of here long enough
[2:56:00] and I believe the hour is here for a
[2:56:02] real sweeping Revival in every church
[2:56:05] around the country
[2:56:07] [Music]
[2:56:09] 60.
[2:56:15] foreign

[2:56:35] read what the prophet thought about that
[2:56:38] I don't want well you can't exhaust His
[2:56:41] abountiful blessings
[2:56:43] could you oh there's the same story a
[2:56:45] little fish out there in the Pacific I
[2:56:47] better drink this water sparingly
[2:56:48] because I might run out
[2:56:50] here he is again the little mouse so big
[2:56:52] under the great Gardens of Egypt I
[2:56:54] better eat ration myself this winter to
[2:56:56] just two grand I might run out before
[2:56:58] the new Harvest
[2:56:59] that's ridiculous
[2:57:01] it's twice that ridiculous a thousand
[2:57:03] times more to think you can exhaust the
[2:57:05] Mercies
[2:57:08] hello help me worship him a minute help
[2:57:11] me worship him a minute
[2:57:14] I'm afraid I'll fail him

[2:57:21] follow God I'll fail him you will I'm
[2:57:23] telling you you likely will but you'll
[2:57:27] never exhaust his mercies toward you
[2:57:33] all right
[2:57:34] he's trying to force it listen
[2:57:37] why he's trying to what
[2:57:40] Force his way into you
[2:57:44] ask abundantly that your Joys might be
[2:57:47] full no way to exhaust him I don't want
[2:57:50] him to have to force his way
[2:57:52] [Music]
[2:57:54] he said like a pump the more you pump
[2:57:57] the fresher the water gets glory be to
[2:57:59] God come on somebody
[2:58:03] how do I know what to ask for look at
[2:58:05] the Kingdom

[2:58:20] living at the spout where the glory is
[2:58:23] coming out

[2:58:32] living at the spout where the glory is
[2:58:35] coming out I love
[2:58:39] that
[2:58:41] like a pump
[2:58:43] the more you pump the fresher the water
[2:58:45] gets
[2:58:48] how many needs are in here today
[2:58:53] hold up your hand if you have a need
[2:58:56] how many has a desire
[2:58:59] there's something you'd like to see the
[2:59:01] Lord do
[2:59:05] you can have those
[2:59:07] delight yourself in the Lord
[2:59:09] the Bible said he'll give you the
[2:59:11] desires of your heart
[2:59:13] hello
[2:59:15] I've been asking for wives for people
[2:59:17] who need them I don't need one
[2:59:19] come on
[2:59:23] I've been asking for husbands Godly sold
[2:59:26] out men
[2:59:28] for young sisters who need them
[2:59:32] some of them need them to support them
[2:59:34] and walk alongside of them and some of
[2:59:36] them need them to tame them
[2:59:40] but I've been saying Lord
[2:59:42] you know
[2:59:46] I've been asking God for things that uh
[2:59:49] that are a little bit out of my comfort
[2:59:51] zone
[2:59:52] because I as I look at the Kingdom
[2:59:58] we have a situation that has come up in
[3:00:01] Jerusalem that I have not mentioned and
[3:00:02] I'm not going to mention it this morning
[3:00:06] but it has brought me many sleepless
[3:00:08] nights
[3:00:11] and I wake up every day giving it to God
[3:00:16] and I do real well until somebody asks
[3:00:18] me only very few people know
[3:00:21] until somebody asked me have you heard
[3:00:23] anything and I say no and then and then
[3:00:26] all that all that fluttering and you
[3:00:28] know what happens
[3:00:30] and it is not my responsibility
[3:00:33] to bring God's will to pass
[3:00:38] but I've been asking instead of letting
[3:00:40] instead of letting circumstances
[3:00:42] intimidate my faith
[3:00:46] I've been asking God for bigger
[3:00:50] hello
[3:00:54] bigger
[3:00:59] we're gonna need
[3:01:01] more than what we have needed in the
[3:01:03] past because there's promises that have
[3:01:05] been made for this property
[3:01:08] for the work in Jerusalem that has laid
[3:01:11] dormant now for these years and and and
[3:01:13] God has comforted my heart many times by
[3:01:16] telling me not to worry
[3:01:20] because sometimes things look very
[3:01:23] lifeless
[3:01:25] very dormant
[3:01:26] and suddenly
[3:01:30] hello
[3:01:31] I'm going we're leaving
[3:01:35] if you raise your hand and said I've got
[3:01:37] a need I want you to present that need
[3:01:39] to God today I want you to do it big
[3:01:45] somebody's here and you need a little
[3:01:47] help with your water bill I don't want
[3:01:48] you to say Lord I need to get that water
[3:01:50] bill paid I want you to put them all in
[3:01:52] there Lord I'm trusting you
[3:01:56] add a little something to what you've
[3:01:58] been asking God for find yourself this
[3:02:01] week
[3:02:02] like Elias had this testimony of how God
[3:02:05] helped him in his moment of Crisis
[3:02:08] because he spoke
[3:02:11] let God you know we don't want to we
[3:02:14] don't want there to have to be adverse
[3:02:16] circumstances for our faith to grow
[3:02:17] let's Let It Grow now
[3:02:20] let's Let It Grow this morning we don't
[3:02:23] want to have to have harder situations
[3:02:25] so that we can have greater Faith let's
[3:02:27] Let it go this morning let's turn it
[3:02:29] loose this morning let's knock
