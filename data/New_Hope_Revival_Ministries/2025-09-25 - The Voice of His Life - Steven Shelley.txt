Description:
It takes more than air to make an instrument sing—it takes living breath. In the same way, we are instruments in the hands of the Lord. In these last days, it’s not about our own words or our own thoughts, but about carrying the voice of the Spirit. The Bride will speak only what He gives, or she will keep still. Like Jesus, who spoke nothing but what the Father showed Him, we are called to let His breath move through us—so the sound of Heaven is heard on earth.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
It takes more than air to make this thing work. And it takes more than air to make this instrument work. It takes breath. Living vibrating breath, not air. Breath. &gt;&gt; That's what makes this sound. That's what makes this sound. And that's what makes you sound. &gt;&gt; Because you and I are instruments unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; And we don't have much to say in the last day. We really don't have much to say of our own accord. We really desire to know the mind of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Uh the prophet told us that in those last days the bride would have thus saith the lord. &gt;&gt; Now I don't think thus sayaith the lord should be a punctuation on every interpretation of tongues or on every inspired gifted exhortation. You can if you know it. If you know that, you know that you know that you know. But once you roll something off of you and you roll it entirely on the Lord, it better be. &gt;&gt; He said in that last day the bride will have thus sayaith the Lord or she will do what? &gt;&gt; She'll keep still. &gt;&gt; She has nothing to say and nothing to do. Jesus had nothing to say and nothing to do. He said, "Except it be shown of me." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Of the eternal spirit of my father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the prophet taught us that he moved by vision. &gt;&gt; Jesus ministered many times by vision. &gt;&gt; Not just by sunship or by being the word manifest. &gt;&gt; He moved many times in ministry by vision. And you and I have been called to carry on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The ministry of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; in the earth. Is that right? &gt;&gt; That doesn't make you Jesus. &gt;&gt; It makes you Mrs. Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm good with that. &gt;&gt; Anybody follow? &gt;&gt; I'm good with that. &gt;&gt; Married to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Married to him. And without some uncction, she's going to say little and do little. But when that uncction comes and she knows who's she is and who it is that has taken control, he will be able to speak through her. He said as the final voice of God to the age. &gt;&gt; The bride. The bride. &gt;&gt; The bride. &gt;&gt; The bride. &gt;&gt; She won't be hot air. She won't just be a bunch of hot air. &gt;&gt; She's got to have the breath, the vibrating life, &gt;&gt; the breath, the spirit breath, the spirit life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In New Testament numa in in Old Testament ruach, it's more than wind, more than air. It's vibrating living substance because it's spirit breath, spirit life. I tell you, you've got a well. You get the Holy Ghost. You get the Holy Ghost. You better get the Holy Ghost because when you get the Holy Ghost inside of you, he is an artisian well. &gt;&gt; He never stops giving out. &gt;&gt; He just pumping, pumping, pumping, pumping out. And it's not air. And it's not oxygen. It's vibrating breath, &gt;&gt; vibrating life &gt;&gt; that come from the original life. There's something down on the inside of me that I it just keeps bubbling out. It just keeps coming out. And that's where [Applause] &gt;&gt; that's where my joy comes from. And that's where my life comes from. My peace comes from that. &gt;&gt; My get up and go. My press on &gt;&gt; the zeal of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It comes from something on the inside. It's not a pull from without. It's a pull from within.
