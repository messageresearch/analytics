Nathan's been after me to sing this song for I don't know a year and a half I found it during the last period of carrying Edith and for those of you who don't know I dealt with a tremendous amount of anxiety and fear during her journey to Earth and um when the Lord revealed that to me the other night that I had let fear pretty much weave its way into about every aspect of my life I was really shocked because I never would have thought of myself as a fearful person I was seeing too many miracles I've seen God move in such Supernatural ways that doctors stood in absolute awe I've seen that they had to come back to life I was seen The Impossible made possible and yet I was still sitting there in my little boat really afraid to get out and walk on the water because I can't swim and the Lord just really been dealing with gentle way lately and he just said you know me so stop focusing on what you can't do and start focusing on what I can do and that's what this song is about [Music] good [Music] Ness I'm scared to death trying to stay afloat s [Music] peace [Music] to get out of this boat cause I know me but I know hey [Music] if I know me I still be wondering why four days late

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah thank you shoshana I'm glad I know Jesus I know me but I'm glad for a revelation from the word of God that I don't have to keep expressing what I know about me but I can say what I know about him and what he has said about me I have the mind of Christ I am bought with a price all of my sins he put him away from me he put him in the sea of his forgetfulness he doesn't remember them against me anymore I'm glad that he knows me and he called me chose me he elected me Justified me oh Hallelujah he's already glorified me I'm glad for the grace of God that is in my life would you stand with us today as we're preparing our hearts to hear the word of the Lord how we bless you Jesus Hallelujah sing this course with us today um [Music] worthy oh Lord [Music] you

Worthy O Lord come on and give the Lord a hand clap of Praise would you do it come on you praised him you've entered in this morning don't let it slip away [Applause] you worked hard to create an atmosphere this morning don't let it slip away from you this day hold on to it so the word can minister to your life oh he's wonderful he's wonderful you may be seated 90 years ago today brother Branham was standing in the middle of the Ohio River baptizing hundreds of people who had come there were hundreds of people who were witnessing that baptism on the banks of the Ohio River when brother Branham came to the 17th person and there was a light that came down out of Heaven many Saw the Light but there were those who said they heard the voice many say it said that they saw the light and didn't hear the voice some said they heard the voice and didn't see the light that sounds like the book of Acts but there was a voice that spoke out of heaven and said as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of the Lord Jesus your message will forerun his second coming so we believe that we are in the season of the second coming of the Lord we're in the season of the second coming of the Lord so today is a is an interesting day to think about those things that was in 1933 did I get that right is 33 and 20 23 90 years and that's quite old there are very few people if any that were there that day still alive if you think about it even brother Billy Paul wasn't born in 33 was he no he was born in 35. and so very few people if any were there who saw that with their own eyes are still alive today but I am a witness how can you be a witness if you didn't see it because I believe it I believe it there are many things about this message that I don't understand but I believe it I believe it I believe it I believe it I want to do what he said do if you come across it and you don't understand it he said you just leave it sitting there you just put it on a shelf and you just leave it there until the understanding comes I've prayed all morning I've prayed all morning that understanding would come to this service that your eyes would be Anointed with I Salve and that you would leave here today with a deeper revelation of this truth than you have ever had before it is the truth I don't care what Google says it is the truth it's Vindicated by the Lord Jesus Christ and it's it's the Preparatory message for the bride it's getting us ready and I'm thankful for that today I want to say this before it slips my mind you people are going to have a week when that podcast comes out you're going to want to sit down and watch it all at one time because it is a tremendous podcast that was taped here on was it Thursday or Friday Thursday afternoon it was absolutely outstanding Joshua interviewed Hawk and Hawk gave his testimony of coming to the Lord and there was such a presence oh thank you Jesus I was a few minutes late getting out here I was in a session with someone and was a few minutes late getting out here I found it so hard to sit in the Pew and turn my neck that way for long Benjamin so delicately quietly he's not usually delicate or quiet but delicately and quietly he got me a chair and put it over here in the aisle and I was able to watch it I couldn't help myself my hands kept going up I couldn't help myself to hear what a transformation God has worked in Hawk's life for his glory there were things that I had heard before and there were things that I had never heard before and then at the end of it there was such a wonderful presence of the Lord that came as they prayed and I know I don't uh hope and anticipate with just hope I know that there will be many many people's lives changed touched encouraged strengthened because of that podcast so I want to thank them both and Joshua is coming to his own God is really using him and it was it was [Applause] foreign [Applause] to experience it and I know we don't have an exact date of its uh uh of its release but it will be released this week and and I just know you're going to be touched so you that are streaming the service watch for it and share it like it Heart It share it comment on it because every time you do that you send it to a new place in the algorithm and that means more people will randomly see it that would have never seen it before the more action it gets on it haven't you said that before I'm gonna say it again the more action it gets the more reaction that you have to it you should comment you should like it you should share it and by doing so you will reach people it may not sound like much to you but it's been a long journey to get us here and yesterday we reached 6 000 followers on Facebook for the ministry page six thousand that's pretty outstanding foreign we have passed many of our friends in Ministry and it's not a competition by any means it has taken a long time to get to this place where our presence is so widely known on Facebook on Instagram and uh on uh what else is it uh YouTube uh it's taken a long time to get to this place where new people because of your reactions because of your comments because of your shares now people who have no connection to any of us are now getting it in their feeds so it's you you're the one sending it out there and uh and God is using it I have had tons of personal comments back to me through Messenger uh on my private Facebook page concerning the clip that has was released this week of uh sister Megan yovich's song I Wish somebody's Soul would catch on fire and there was such an anointing that comes it comes through the speaker it comes through the device I weep every time I watch it it's transferable anointing and the people are feeling it and people are coming and reaching out and asking me to be connected with them in in Facebook and as soon as I say yes here's their comments they say it takes me back to my childhood that's the fire that used to be in the church on YouTube a brother I think one of one of the one of the platforms your brother reaches out and said we need that all over South Africa we need that and uh I I was watching a YouTube uh clip or video this week of another ministering brother in the message and I was so blessed he's taken a very unpopular stand against the um against the Press Play and Obey movement and uh that movement that desires to take the pulpit uh from the fivefold ministry and give it to a tape recorder and uh he's made such an outstanding and Brave and Bold stand against that movement I usually just anonymously watch but I couldn't do that this week I found one that was so strikingly poignant that I had to comment on it and his comment back to me was to thank us for our ministry to the former Amish Brethren who he is also in contact with and he said to update you from a few years back he said we're having Holy Ghost services in our church and dancing in the spirit and I just wanted you to know that and he put it right on YouTube for everybody to read and so God is doing it's not about dancing it's not about running around it's about freedom how can you say you have freedom in Jesus Christ and look like a corpse through a three-hour service there's no life in that and so God's just doing stuff and I want to thank him for it and praise him for it so let's get the word out every chance we can today is ariely's uh it's just Ariel for the rest of you for me it's ariely today is her 14th birthday she's got a baby I think in her arms so we won't ask her to stand up but let's say happy birthday to Ariel [Applause] I was just on the other side of the door when she was born and uh in their home and God worked a miracle for her he really did she had a little complication and uh she was was not a normal color when she got here she was pretty blue and within just a few minutes the Lord moved for her and she was as beautiful that day as she is today and God has been good to that family and they thought well she was so beautiful and so so near perfect that they would just that would just probably be the Caboose I guess that's it what it seems to be but anyway tomorrow is Sister Sharon's birthday and she's not here to to hear our birthday greetings to her but she will hear them in archive she is a very special prayer intercessor in in my life I appreciate her prayers more than I could ever say and her daughter wanted her to come and be in Tucson this week for her birthday she comes home Thursday I believe and we miss her in the service just like we've missed sister flow so so much we're so thankful that God has moved and uh and she's with us today but if you get a chance to reach out if you know how to text her or something uh reach out to sister Sharon and she's very thoughtful person I'll tell you that there's not many occasions that she forgets and so if you could possibly remember that and then Tuesday of this week Brother Richard and sister Elita Ellsworth have have an anniversary and if I've added it up right it's 43 years does that sound right [Music] I mean that's a long time 43 years so may God bless them both and let's greet them [Applause] lord is good then on Thursday of this week it's a very special little girl's birthday she's uh nor a lamb to me that's not her name that's what I call her uh after a great Chinese

you should have known that 15 through 17. God bless you brother from Houston Texas I think you all had quite a storm if I saw that this in the news this morning I am thankful that you're all right I hope that that everyone is quite a lot of flooding and Amarillo we've been getting prayers for requests from our wonderful sainted friends in Amarillo who are really dealing with a lot of flooding God bless you from Tema my brother and brother Samson God bless you as well first Thessalonians chapter 4. verse 15 through 17 it's 12 17 and he caught Watchers there we're just starting for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout where the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord this is not metaphorical language this isn't poetry or prose this is a coming promise it is a promise from the Lord and it will have physical reality in the near future in fact it is unfolding even now the Rapture process began somewhere around the year 1963 so we are 73 83 93 2003 2013 2023 we are approximately 60 years into the Rapture process and in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that last Trump is going to sound finishing the process somebody said you really believe that I really believe it you really believe we're in the Rapture now I believe I'm in the Rapture now I was raptured this morning that presence of God caught me up this morning into him it happened to me last weekend I've been raptured since the weekend I got raptured here Tuesday night listening to these amazing testimonies of the grace of God I went to prayer Friday here and I felt the same presence of God just catch me right up so we're in the process of the change we're being changed now anybody with me may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word I almost left you standing you may be seated now who's ready to study I didn't hear you we got a little studying to do this morning it may not be exciting but it's it's necessary to get some things that we've been talking about and I'm going to use some terminology in a moment that some of you will most of you will be very familiar with but I want to refresh your memory on where we get this term so that you'll understand that many things are happening spiritually right now simultaneously and it you can't read a book of the Bible simultaneously in other words you could actually be reading two chapters and those two chapters may actually have their fulfillment at the same time and they may not even be in the Bible chronologically now I know there are many people who believe the Bible is written chronologically but it's not so so you may we they they the the editors and those who have given us our modern form of the Holy Bible they have decided for us the order of the books of the Bible and we get over to the Book of Revelation and many people believe that the Book of Revelation is truly written in chronological order that's incorrect because the Book of Revelation is often giving us the atmosphere of Heaven and the atmosphere of Earth at the same time but in another chapter in other words there is a lap over or a crossing over or there is a simultaneous happening going on in one chapter and the next chapter so it tells what's happening in Earth at the same time that these other things are happening in heaven did I thoroughly confuse you or do you understand what I'm saying if you do say Amen we understand and so sometimes people can get really bogged down when they study the Book of Revelation or read the book of Revelation because they don't understand that sometimes we're hearing what's happening around the throne in one section of verses and then the next verse it starts telling us what's happening on the earth and and it doesn't mean that this happens in heaven and then this happens in Earth it means it's happening at the same time so John being an eagle prophet he was not only able to tell us the things that would be off the Earth he was able to tell us what would be in the heaven and he saw it in his time transported to our time via the spirit and so he time traveled in the realm of the spirit and that's powerful to understand because he has an insight to what's about to happen because to him he already saw it happen isn't that good and so I want to go to the message the Rapture and I've added a couple of paragraphs to what we've already read in this study we did 154 and 155. I mentioned to you that brother Branham is quite distracted at times in this sermon because they are they're coming to to try to clear the dishes it was a dinner they're coming to try to clear the dishes and uh there are several times where he kind of stumbles a bit and backs up and goes on and finally I can't remember exactly how that happened but finally I think brother Branham turned to someone off the mic and said I'll pay for the extra time if they'll just leave us alone and he knew that there was more to this that needed to be spoken because he was about to leave the scene and the next thing we were to look for in a as a major event was the Rapture and so we would need to understand that and so I've added paragraph 152 and 153 to our study now it's the first thing it's a trumpet no no he corrects himself a voice a shout and then a voice and then a trumpet so Shout a messenger giving the people ready so if I were a note taker don't get too distracted by your notes and Miss what's happening here but if I were a note taker I would write that down number one shout a messenger getting the people ready and I would add to that that it's a message it's a message the emphasis should not be on the messenger the emphasis should be on the message how many of you agree with that now let me see if I can find something that that's not planned but it came to my mind and I may not be able to find it fast enough yes uh let me just this you won't have it and I don't want you to lose where we are but if you happen to pull it it's all right but you can write it down you studyers it's in the message Investments 1963-0803 B and that must have been a breakfast I'm assuming and uh paragraph 107 says and now if your denomination has closed the door to such a message and such a messenger not me I'm your brother fellow servant with you now let's hear what brother Branham says about the messenger but the messenger is the Holy Spirit expressing himself through human beings the church that Christ Sanctified for this very purpose now those of you who are looking for it there may not have found it let me read it to you again paragraph 107 and now if your denomination has closed the door to such a message and such a messenger thank you not me this is August of 63. the shout is going out and brother Branham does not want the emphasis on him come on he says not me I'm your brother so for those who teach that brother Branham is in the book of the Revelation teaching John the end time the the the the the one who says to him I am of your fellow servants the brethren in order for that to have happened we would have to believe something that we don't even believe and so that wasn't particularly brother Branham they tried to make something out of that why don't we just stick with the word and try to follow what he said he said not me I'm your brother a fellow servant with you but the messenger is the holy spirit expressing himself through human beings brother Branham was one of those human beings that the Holy Spirit was expressing himself through I pray that there are those Among Us that the Holy Spirit can express himself through in the last days because that was the call to the corporate bride isn't that right so not me I'm your brother fellow servant with you but the messenger is the holy spirit expressing himself through human beings the church that Christ Sanctified for this very purpose now that's powerful the church was Sanctified washed and set apart for the very purpose that the Holy Spirit could come and Minister through them so brother Branham was a conduit you and I must also be conduits pipes pipelines for the Holy Ghost to flow through to speak through to minister through in such an hour as this now we go back to the Rapture message we're studying this morning we go back to the Rapture message and he says shout a messenger getting the people ready now let me ask you who is the messenger getting people ready holy spirit is the messenger and we all can see if you can't you're blind you need some help I'll help you if you're willing there's no sin in asking questions there's no sin when you don't understand something if there's no sin in asking you do it in a right Spirit you do it at the right time you do it in the right forum you don't interrupt the preacher to ask a question is that right brother random taught us from the scripture that the spirit of the prophets are subject to the prophets you don't interrupt one who's being used for that moment you do it at the right time and in an order let all things be done a decent in in decently and in order this is how we we certainly understand but I don't want anybody to think you are going to be criticized or ostracized because you don't understand something we ask and we we do what I mentioned earlier uh could not take this off we uh we need the eyes of our understanding opened because this message is to simplify things not complicate things [Music] now the second is a voice of the Resurrection and the Bible tells us in first Thessalonians 4 it's the voice of the archangel which is a chief angel and that Angel's voice is made up of the voices of a many-membered bride it's not bride talking it's Christ talking through them amen that's what makes it Chief that's what makes it head that's what causes it to stand out above all other voices it's a Vindicated voice speaking of Vindicated word and it's the same voice that that's going to call the little bride out of the grave good morning that little bride is going to call for the resurrection of her fellow bride members it will be the voice of the bridegroom echoed Amplified like a microphone through the voice of the Bride collectively speaking brother random said the second is the voice of the Resurrection the same voice a loud voice in Saint John 11 38-44 that called Lazarus from the grave now here we find out that the same voice of the Archangel that will awake the sleeping Saints is the same voice that called Lazarus from the grave now whose voice was that it was the voice of Our Lord it was the voice of Jesus Christ and that voice is also the voice of the eternal spirit of the father because Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Lord Jesus Christ of the New Testament if you understand that say man they are not two people Jesus is not the second person I heard brother Bannon preaching the other day and he made a slip he said the Holy Ghost the third person not the trinity he knew better than that is not what the word said that's not what God says remember that's not what the messenger was saying that was Humanity that got in the way and we do that sometime but nothing was lost because here we are the bride we're not here trying to prove brother Ben I'm wrong we don't have to the word corrects we're just here to say we had a human vessel one who could misspeak over over speak get things out of order when he's telling them he just did it here he said here the first thing is a trumpet in paragraph 152 the beginning the verse saying the trumpet or a voice a shout he finally got it in fact he says a trumpet a voice a shout a voice and then a trumpet foreign now that's because you and I were here for a reason we're here to study this out we're here to take everything back to the word and then we can recognize that the the shout is the message to gather the bride together the voice of the Archangel is a voice of Christ it is the voice of the Resurrection it is Christ speaking his word through a mini-membered bride he said it's the same voice that called Lazarus from the grave now let's go on getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the Dead see to be caught up with it now watch the three things take place the next is what was a trumpet that's right the trumpet follows The Voice then he says a voice a shout a voice a trumpet where what are we doing here we're studying this we're taking it back to the word what's the order shout voice trumpet let me hear you say Shout voice trumpet three phases of the Rapture shout voice trumpet now the the third thing in paragraph 153 is a trumpet which always at the Feast of trumpets is calling the people to the feast and that'll be the bride's supper I love the way he said that he said that will be the bride's supper the Lamb's supper with the bride now where does that take place I'd like to speak to some of you perusia Brethren out there who say that it will take place in the earth or has already taken place in the earth you are wrong he said clearly here that the Lambs suffer with the bride is in this in the sky which means in the dimensions of the heavenlies correct which may not be as far away from Earth as what we think are you with me do I have to explain that are you there or can we go on 154 the first thing comes forth is his message now that's a capital h the editor wanted you to know it's not William branham's message brother Brandon was referring to him Christ calling the bride together and this has been a process you see the shout was going out at least we know we're not going to try to put definite years on this because we believe that the messenger Holy Spirit was already at work when brother Branham is just beginning his ministry so we're not going to say that that the the shout is only 63-65 but if we had to boil it down we would say that through the years 1963 to 65 a definitive message was being presented now much of that message had its foundation in earlier sermons but in 63 through 65 there was an anointing to bring things into a concise message that we could search through those years and find a tremendous Foundation to stand on to understand who we are and what our ministry will be in the end time did you follow that I'm not going to say that something after 63 was more anointed than before it's all part of the messenger the Holy Spirit doing his work of ministry through a vessel but if you were running out of time and you didn't have time to search through the earlier years you can get Rapture Ready by receiving a revelation of the ministry that was presented during that period of time let me think about that and make sure that I I haven't misspoken make sure that you're not confused is that okay to say I think it is let's go on so first the call the message calls the bride together the next thing it's a resurrection of the sleeping bride the ones that died back in the other ages they're caught together that's the voice of the Archangel that's catching them together the Trump is what causes the dead then to get up at the sounding of that last call that's when they they not only awakened spiritually but even those who are naturally dead are awakened and the trumpet the feast in the heavens in the sky why that's the thing that takes place friend so he's talking about the lamb supper the bride's supper and then in paragraph 155 are you still here we're studying we're right there ready now the only thing the church coming out has got to lay before the son to ripen I I see some ripening taking place Tuesday night I heard about some ripening happening in the lives of the Bride don't you take some old dead life that has no unction no anointing no quickening power in it and tell me that somebody ripening in the sun they're rotting they're sitting in churches across this world today rotting because you cannot ripen under a dead letter you can't even ripen under the mechanics only [Applause] it takes them the Dynamics to come down on the mechanics that's what you see God doing in this day Hallelujah the only thing the church coming out has got to lay before the sun to ripen the great combine will come by after a while the wheat will be burned the stalks but the grain will be gathered into its Garner see how many of you can follow that through so the shout Ministry uh was predominantly from 1963 to 1965. so if you are just beginning to hear the messages I encourage you I don't usually say things like this but I encourage you to focus on those ears for now will give you suggestions and assignments from the entire Ministry of the messenger but I think you would really appreciate the quickening power that that falls on those years of ministry the ministry of the voice of the Archangel which is Christ speaking through his bride that has been going on we could say anywhere from 1963 those who were receiving the shout Ministry then all the way up to the hour that we are living in now 63 73 83 93 2003 2013. 60 years of voice of Archangel Ministry it has not culminated yet how do I know because the bride has not yet received her change but we are closer to it than we have ever been before and the only way to know where we are is to look in and see where we are and that's what we're trying to do this morning and then the trumpet will be the final Rapture call when we have received a body change and rise to meet the Lord in the air so we can say as I stated a moment ago the process of the Rapture has been going on since 1963. We Believe that since brother branham's Ministry was the shout the message and since the trumpet is the final Rapture call which is yet to come that we as a bride the bride of Christ are currently fulfilling the voice phase of the coming of the Lord so if you want to know where we are we are in that period of the voice of the Archangel Christ is speaking to and through his bride we are re-digging the wells that brother Branham dug in the 60s anybody with me we know what happened the enemy comes in Abraham dug some wells and the enemy comes in and fills up those Wells is that right and so Isaac came along and it was a part of his Destiny and his call to re-dig to unstop the wells that Abraham his father had dug before him and I'm standing before you this morning recognizing that we have the same call that was given to Isaac this little bride has got to re well Glory we've got to re-dig the whales that were dug a generation ago somebody said why because we must prophesy again [Applause] Revelation 10 11. it's our responsibility then and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and kings in order to do that we don't start over I hope you're with me we're studying we don't go off over here and start digging new whales trying to make something happen no we don't do anything by striving come on and that's what many people have tried to do they try to make their own message they try to make themselves or someone they care about an eighth Messenger to kind of come we're waiting on him we're waiting on him and look I can do the same thing I can show you quotes all through the message where brother Branham says I'm only laying a foundation for him and if you didn't know any better you think for him was going to be a human being born to a woman but if you get a revelation and put all the quotes together he told he told us who he was coming to forerun he said my Ministry is to Forum the coming word the coming word is the hymn the real messenger the Holy Ghost is the hymn so we're not looking for another worldwide messenger or leader to come we're following the same messenger that William Branham followed that little bride's got to speak as he spoke and we do that not by digging our own Wells I wish you'd wake up in here we do it by re-digging whales that have already been dubbed that the enemy came in that's what I'm trying to do this morning I may not be doing too good at it but that's what I'm trying to do this morning is to unstop some wells you hang around a minute or two and you'll know where I'm going in a moment we're trying to unstop some things and I don't mean no harm I don't want to get into this I spent the early part of my Ministry having to fight against these things that people said that were contrary to the word and the message I don't want to end my Ministry with having to do the same thing predominantly but I find myself realizing that somebody anybody everybody has got to do their part so I want to say that a lot of these Wells that brother Branham dug and PR and that provided Living Water to so many people it was preachers who who stopped them up [Music] come on I hate to say it but you know it's the truth and if you don't want to be identified with what I just said just don't say a man loud amen so that they can catch your voice I don't want him to catch your voice on the stream if you don't want to be identified with that here we are told that the that the laodicea and church age was about the restoration of the gifts so we come on down here in the laodicea and church age is still going on and what do they come and tell us the gifts are done away with we know it's not true because God doesn't restore and then take it back he is restoring the bride tree he's putting the fruit back on the tree he's restoring it he's rebuilding it he's not stripping it down in fact I think we should have in this hour do we may probably not but I think we should have in this hour the highest order of spiritual gifts that the church has ever known because we now have the word to discern those gifts to check those gifts to judge those gifts to put those gifts in their proper place we don't have triple married people running around living all kinds of lives doing all kinds of things and then wanting to lead the bride of Christ with gifts we don't have such as that what brother Branham had to say about the gifts a lot of the time and I think Hawk mentions it in the podcast where did I did I make that up Park yes no you said it you said something about you had come across some of the negative in the message concerning gifts because there is some corrective words that are spoken there that some people have gone to seed on they took that comment out of context of scripture and they've gone way too far and that's very convenient when you have sin in the church and you want to try to keep it hidden did I just say that what are you doing this morning I'm re-digging some wells oh God is not a I don't want to say this thing I'm sorry I often say Indian giver I I am partial Native American uh my my great-grandmother uh great great grandmother was full-blooded Cherokee Indian and and I don't believe that that that uh the First Nations people are the or the Indian people as we call them I don't believe that they were all the time trying to trick and and cheat uh I think that was the white man doing that [Applause] but but there is a term that we're kind of familiar with an Indian giver somebody who gives you something and then comes to take it back well I'd say that would be the white man that did that we they gave them a partial of land and then come in and put so many restrictions and stipulations and uh until they were really just in essence taking a little pizza bits and pizzas back until they were pressed into a tiny little spot and we're suffering I want you to know the First Nations and Native American people are suffering today still today because of some of this mistreatment the drugs the human trafficking is is higher in those communities than any Community we know of in North America because it has created this dependency uh we could say a lot here huh but I'm going to move on now but you're familiar with that term I don't believe God cheats like that I don't believe God restores the gifts and then takes him away I believe God restores them and then he perfects them so I think that tongues and interpretation should be more perfect Among Us it should be I didn't say it necessarily is it should be more perfect Among Us than any group of people in the world because we have the word to judge and to discern what a gift is supposed to be and so it's not that God has taken them now we understand uh that we've sort of moved up into the intellect we've moved up into the brain and we are under a flying eagle anointing we understand that but remember that's just a higher order of God speaking brother random believed that the preachers were anointed to speak the word he believed it he said you he's talked about getting as close to the pulpit as you can get because that's where the angel stands he said it and that's where God comes down to speak to his people that doesn't mean everybody who stands every man who stands here uh is is God to the people we're not making God out of men especially this one because I'm like sister shoshana I know me didn't you appreciate that I know me I I get so tired sometimes of this superficial way of living where we don't even know ourselves and we portray I'll tell you social media has created that environment where a woman can have a filthy house but she doesn't post a picture of that she just builds her a little clean corner somewhere and takes a picture of that leading you to believe that the whole house looks like a man scene and I don't think it should and if and if your house looks like a magazine all the time I don't think you're really living I don't think you're letting your children be children let me preach on that a minute my mother thought everything had to be just right just so so I was the cleanest child in the county I saw Ezekiel the other day uh he's the one I saw a picture of stripped off in his diaper mud from the top of his head all the way to his feet in fact I heard he stripped off his diaper oh if that panics you you're not really living either we create huge taboos calling more attention to things that we ought to just let be normal life creating curiosity that ought not to be created oh I got so many subjects going on here I'll never finish I'll never finish I think we ought to live I don't want I don't want nasty nobody wants that but I think that that sometimes living has to take priority over everything being in its place all the time appearance my mother could not parent that way that way my mother would have would have and I don't want to make you have any bad thoughts toward my mother but it would have been closer to a beating than a whipping if she would have found me looking like uh Ezekiel was looking here the other night I was not allowed to get dirty now what kind of life is that so there are times when I'm off for the day I have to make myself take a shower my mother's fault squeak it clean all the time on come on my mother would buy me play clothes not at the second hand store she'd buy me play clothes and then tell me not to ruin them now you know why I got so many Hang-Ups and problems let your family live let your children live it's not about a social media moment I love posting I love watching I love seeing what people post but I like it when it's real I like it when Anna Christine some months ago she posted a messy room blankets and books and soar and then in the next slide it's all cleaned up that's reality a few minutes ago it looked like a cyclone had come through named Mrs Glenn but now reality she didn't she wasn't Bewitched she didn't twinkle her nose and it all cleaned up she had to get in there and clean it up and then post a picture which give every mother in the world hope so be real how did I get on that you're real we're building families to be real not so secretive all the time Not So Undercover all the time if you're doing something that you're ashamed for somebody else to know don't tell [Applause] if you're wearing something that you don't want anybody else to know you wore it don't wear it [Applause] oh my goodness the preacher's here thank you thank you thank you amen okay I can keep going now where were we anybody got any thoughts where we were yeah God didn't give him he's perfecting them he didn't give them to take them back thank you Josh he gave them to perfect them nothing brings Perfection to something like the word so we are now as the bride of Christ currently fulfilling the voice phase of the coming of the Lord and each one of these phases each one of these phases that falls underneath the voice I'll have to show you that in a minute again remind you of what I mean in a minute because underneath that voice John was told to eat that book eat up that book sweet in the mouth bitter in the belly and then he was told to prophesy again each one of these phases [Applause] third pool I want to make sure this morning that when we refer to the third pool that the people will be able to understand what we are referring to there is a direct connection between Revelation 10 8 through 11. and the third pull I want to make sure that you are able to see that Revelation 10 1-7 is part of the shout it's part of the ministry of the messenger of the Holy Ghost and how he spoke through brother Branham as a chosen vessel to gather a message together to present a message that would gather a bride together but in eight through eleven now let's read that let's read it again and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth that was Christ and I went under the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be sweet uh in thy mouth sweet as honey in thy mouth and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me read it for me please [Music] you see I don't believe that was Mr John I believe that's us this uh this monitor needs to come down just a tad because when I move back it's it squeaks just a bit not much but just a little bit so we understand that the ministry of the shout is sort of covered in Revelation 10 1-7 and then the voice of the Archangel which is the voice of Christ the word of God in the mouth of the Bride that is covered in the last verses Revelation 10 8 through 11. I want you to know that I believe that the third pool is more applicable to Revelation 10 8 through 11. then Revelation 10 1-7 now in order for you to catch that come to the conclusion that I've come to I want to make sure that we understand what the term means third pool are you willing to let me do that now this is going to take some reading and my part some listening on your part in the message why are people so tossed about beginning in paragraph 34. but I went home tired weary upset crying went to bed that night and after the wife got to sleep I went into the room and knelt down and said dear Jesus I don't know what I'm going to do here I am right back where I started from again see I guess I made a failure are you with me two hours from then he appeared to me now I want you to catch the context of the vision he feels like a failure again has anybody in here ever felt like a failure again here is a man that God is using in the healing Revival the voice of healing Revival is is sweeping the world this is a powerful time 1956. the dead are being raised blind eyes are open and it wasn't just in the ministry of brother Branham it was happening world over and here he comes feeling like a failure again two hours from then he appeared to me and he showed me a vision of such a panoramic view of people I never seen I was talking to my wife in the vision now you people that know me know I'm not a fanatic I don't say these things unless they're the truth that's right and I've seen it now I would rather brandem say something like that because he caught the doubt [Music] he caught the question the critical doubt that started creeping into somebody's mind maybe their toast was burnt that morning maybe they got up on the wrong side of the bed maybe they were normally it was easier for them to believe than to doubt but this particular morning he begins to speak on this and something comes flooding in the atmosphere of the room they caught it he said I'm not a fanatic you know that I don't say these things unless they're the truth that's right I've seen it I seen brother arganbright standing there I went up to him he said brother Billy we we've give out the prayer all the prayer cards and everything is ready now for the meeting this is a vision we got a way to take you in and out I said thank you brother Argan bride why would brother arginbrite say that to him because he said it was a panoramic crowd like he had never seen before he said I walked over to see some more Brethren and there was another brother preaching I said who is he they said they put him up and I said who is they and they just turned around and walked away and the man May dismiss the audience and let them all go and I said oh he shouldn't do that because there is no altar call now those of you who have studied this ministry for years as I have you will know that there was a partial fulfillment of that that took place I believe in Mexico I could be wrong about the location but the Ministerial Association got involved in one of the meetings there and they tried to send the people home cancel the meeting but this is a vision he's talking about and I uh there is no altar call let's go on oh he said that other fellow spoke up and said we've done took up the offering I said when is the offering more important than Souls before Christ see did you miss what I just said they were interested in the offering brother Branham was concerned about souls and at that the angel of the Lord taken me out then and taken me to a real bright stream of water it was the most beautiful blue water and great fish we're swimming around in it he said I will make you a Fisher and he said Now cast your lure into the water when you do pull it slow first time next time just give a little jerk not too hard how many of you know what that's for to set the hook and the next time set your hook for the catch and I started throwing my line in the water now the first time he given a little jerk is to make the fish Chase it the second time is to set the hook the next time is to set the hook and I started I throwed my line in the water I pulled it everybody began rejoicing say that's wonderful that's wonderful see he's gone from a meeting being dismissed to a beautiful fishing place where there must be Brethren standing around he's cast his lure the angel or someone there is teaching him how to do it he said I I thrown my line in the water I pulled it everybody began rejoicing that's wonderful that's wonderful I got all excited wouldn't anybody if an angel was teaching you to fish wouldn't you get excited he said I got all excited and jerked it hard on the next one was out I pulled the fish and all out of the water having experience that I see how that happens I've done it you snatch real hard you pull if it's a little fish you pull it right out of the water no have no need to reel it in you've just snatched it like that and here he comes the flying because he's not very big especially if you're using the cane pole but this was a lure he said it was a little bitty fish listen just about the size of the lure and guess what happened he said I got my line are you still with me good I got my line all tangled up and I was straightening out my line anybody ever done that that's why fly fishing ain't for me I need a reel it was just a bird's nest of line and the man which was talking behind me walked around in front of me dressed in Palestinian clothes and a turban on his head he had a white robe he said brother Branham that's it I said I know I didn't do it right I I said I jerked it when I ought into he said don't get your line tangled up in these kinds of times what a message and I said well I'm running it as straight as I can I'll be careful and he said now the first time I spoke with you you put your hands on the people and told them what was wrong with them and the second poll when you did you would know the secrets of their hearts and I made you a seer before the people leave it there Austin I made you a seer before the people now let me refresh your memory when God first started using Brother Branham he would often take people by the hand the word of the Lord came to him and said as Moses was given two sons the same kind of ministry began to function in brother branham's life you can find the eyewitness of brother Ern Baxter online where he tells as brother branham's Ministry manager at the time what it was like to watch brother branham's hand change as he came in contact with the hand of the patient that may sound strange to you but it happened to Moses remember his hand turned white like leprosy and and I heard earn Baxter say that as I was with brother Branham I began to learn what that what was happening I could tell the disease because I learned by watching his hand and hearing him call the disease then I began to watch his hand and I could tell what the disease was it was that clear sometimes it would turn white sometimes it would be little bumps sometimes streaks of red would come across the hand and by that brother Brandon began to learn what that represented and tell the person their disease that's profound but what's even more prevalent they were healed you can make it up you can get some people to agree to anything but you can't you can't impersonate a healing like that that was God that came down and did the healing and then that was the first pool that was operating in the first pull of the ministry the disease telling people the disease from reading a sign on the hand then he said in a paragraph before this one then the second poll came and that is when he began to discern the thoughts of the people and that's when the gift shifted no longer by a sign in the hand only that still function for a short time as the gifts were crossing over and making a shift and I may be one of the few people interested in this but boy does this really interesting I didn't ask for that I'm not asking for your amen I'm just telling you this is quite fascinating to me and then he would be able to look at them sometimes take their hand and he began to be able to tell them the secrets of the heart and you've seen it you've seen the video and you saw him telling people now one lady you've got a letter in your purse right now from your daughter telling her that I was going to be here and you've come and then he prays for Miss Eva calls out her name front Brown was it brown Eva York calls out her first name and last name this happened oh my goodness my grandmother saw it happening in in Birmingham she said brother Branham turned his back to the audience and went down a whole row near her telling every person with his back turn their name some of them their address some of them their doctor's name how God knows God knows that and what their disease was I've heard brother Brandon the prayer lines and you have two if you've listened to even a handful of tapes and stayed listened to the end and heard any of the prayer lines you've heard him say things like and and you I see you sitting on the side of the bed your doctor has pulled up a little stool he's telling you the results of your X-ray he's telling you you only have so many days or weeks to live he said wait a minute I see you standing before me as a young healthy girl your mother is putting her arm around you and telling you you'll live to arrive old age you're healed thus saith the Lord it's real It's The Sign of the Messiah it's what Jesus did at the well oh I have no I have no husband I'm not mad I don't know oh you've well said you have no husband you've had five and the one you have now the woman you I mean the man you have now he doesn't belong to you he belongs to somebody else and yet there was no condemnation he's not judging her and trying to put her out of the church he's trying to pull her in never a man speak like this man she knew the Messiah I perceive you're him our fathers tell us how this thing's going to go down something's telling me you're the one amen and brother Branham was not the Messiah God allowed that Messianic gift to operate in our generation to show us where we are in God's economy and how it all unfolds then he said that this is the the man standing there a middle eastern garb he calls it Palestinian clothes it was Middle Eastern Garb with a turban on his head which reminds me of Joshua the high priest and the scripture there doesn't it with a clean turban on his head Zechariah 3. but anyway and I made you a seer before the people I gotta hurry and he said now the first time next next paragraph but you was always this is the like a man talking to brother random and what does he do he rebukes him you like saying that don't you I sure do why do you like so much and get so much out of saying that the angel of the Lord rebuked Brother Branham because been there [Music] done that didn't get no silly t-shirt but learned a lot when the Lord puts a weapon on you when the Lord corrects you you want to go under the dirt you don't want to just get out on the dirt you want to stick your head under the floor because you're ashamed that you let anything get out of sort in your life he said and look at what he said brother Banner made this mistake of he said you was always trying to explain it do you understand what it would be like to be called a warlock and operating in Witchcraft and a demon and ESP and reading minds and fortune tellers these are the things the church was saying about brother Branham while secretly sending their people down to the meetings to get healed the pastors would stand in the pulpit and say he was operating as a soothsayer somebody in the church dying they would slip around and say go down to the brand of media don't tell anybody I told you to get a healing so brother random faced such criticism until he was always trying to just explain it a little more to the so that they wouldn't uh think it and he was the one who would take them to the woman at the well and he would try to show that gifts can operate this way and and it's him and you look to him and you know I'm just your brother I'm just your brother you ever heard him say I'm just your brother so all these people that talk about brother man I'm trying to bring the attention of the people to himself well he said well I can't I'm waiting on something you know I'm waiting on something I'm waiting on him and then all of a sudden he's here and he said I just saw that light when it comes sweeping down or across these Stadium lights I think he was making he said I saw those lights come sweeping her down I saw him when they come between me and the light there and come sweeping down he's here and what would he say next he's here I take every spirit in this room under my authority in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ powerful powerful could brother Branham do that as an individual no he could do it because of the commission that was on his life and because the angel of the Lord they came if we could get the angel of the Lord in this room today we could have the same Authority remember he's not just one anymore he divided himself on the day of Pentecost he comes in as fire praise God you're learning something I hope he said but you're always trying to explain it you ought to have done that said you made a public show out of it I said I'm very sorry are you listening that he'd taken me from there my goodness that's all there was and then he taken me from there and I seen a great huge tent and this is what we refer to as the tent the tent vision it's really a part of two other visions there are three phases take the book and eat it up sweet in your mouth billion bitter in your belly prophesy again all three phases of the third pool he taken me from there and I seen a great huge tent and I I never seen such a tent and it was packed in line to everywhere with people and I walked looked like I was standing above the people looking down notice notice notice notice brother Branham was standing above the tent he wasn't in the tent he was looking down on the tent we don't have to have brother Branham to have the tent yes thank you Lord looking down where I just made an altar call in hundreds and hundreds of people were weeping and rejoicing after they had accepted the Lord Jesus as their savior well he sent me say right now that is not one of our ordinary message conventions it's not even an ordinary camp meeting here where hundreds and hundreds of people are Weeping and rejoicing after they had accepted the Lord so something happens somebody's got something going on for together this many people into a place of intimacy very good and hundreds of people we've been rejoicing after they accepted the Lord Jesus as their Savior and I looked and then I heard a man get up and say call the prayer line and people began to line up over on this side the left from where I was looking down towards the platform and they lined all the way up and down the street for a prayer line and I noticed to my left which would have been to my right if I was on the platform if I was on the platform a little wooden building and I seen that light that they have the picture of you know it's always in the meeting I seen that light leave me interesting leave me he said and go to that little building now brother Branham calls it a canvas tent he calls it a piece of stretch canvas he calls it a little wooden building I don't know exactly what it looked like but it reminds me of what the bride in the groom stand under when they are married in a in a middle eastern wedding or a Jewish wedding that little tent that little piece of talit stretched across the top and we know that in in Bible days they would pronounce their vows would be pronounced standing under that little Hoopa and then there then the side curtains would be put up and and I don't mean to be so plain but in the same place where the nuptial vowels were taken the marriage would be consummated not for one day only but for seven days while the guests celebrated now it's quite an interesting parallel because brother Branham is preaching about these things one day and he said what was that word we found I found the other day I can't quite remember what that name was what that word was he's referring to Supernatural things and he's referring to the third pool and he's looking for the word he never does tell us what the word is so for me it's the parallel of that little that little stretch and and if you've got it up on on poles or something it does look like a little wooden structure of some kind it could also look like a piece of stretch canvas it could also look like a little tent within the tent and he called it that once a tent within the tent interesting isn't it what I find interesting is the pillar of fire that was with him left him and went into that building I know you're weary here is this a slow slow go and a voice said to me that's powerful I'll meet you in there the same voice that caused to you and I to meet between the Cherry beams I will meet you there between the wings of the Cherry Bean come on behind the Riven Veil get in behind that Veil and I'll meet you there and listen to what brother Branham said that'll be the third pool when I meet you in that building when I meet you in that little room [Music] when the Lord meets you in that little tent [Music] that's why I said a few moments ago I believe that the third pool is more significant in the bride's Ministry that's why we didn't see the Fulfillment of the tent itself as brother Branham is still alive on the Earth that's why there are many people who believe that he will have to be raised from the dead I hate to even say this I hate to even tell this but it's true that's why there are men today who believe that brother random would have to raise from the dead and hold meetings under a tent for every word of thus saith the Lord to be fulfilled [Music] there's even an airplane sitting in an old forsaken field rusted out I got a picture waiting on the day that we need that airplane good brother random is finding a way to communicate with brothers so he talks to them about Aviation maybe we'll have one like that when we take that 10 around to the meeting so they go by the airplane that's okay that's okay don't you don't be critical that's okay all they knew is that he seemed to know everything that's right and so if he said it well that was enough for them I'm not against that they put the money in an account ready to buy the tent if brother Branham oh I can't believe I'm staying at this plane if brother random or the race from the dead well at least we know they'll have a tent and and I don't think I think they're going to buy a new airplane I believe I heard that that one is beyond repair now it's finally rusted out won't be much good who would think would think rain outpouring of the Holy Ghost that sweeps the bride in the Rapture to Eternity we're still going to need a dc-9 to get somewhere right mind would think that Delta is going to have to take us around we travel as a thought it wrapped your time we won't in an airplane we go back to the day of the first creation [Applause] whose authority is in our mouth we don't need no airplane we don't need a canvas tent [Music] you agree we don't even need brother Branham on the scene why because the voice of the Archangel is with us who is the US the bride of Christ the bride of Christ around the world so we don't have to go back and make these things work [Music] why did we even have that thought why did people even get under that thing because somebody was stopping up the whales always trying to make excuses and explain things away while the bride was just dwindling just dwindling just dwindling no power No Authority no healing no prayers answered come on dead Services dries them on come on just dwindling away to nothing but we're still doing our work we're still busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy busy doesn't matter that nothing is being fulfilled among us we're still busy doing the king's work you're no better off in that shape than laodicea is where the bridegroom standing on the outside knocking to get in hello you're not winning anybody to Christ unless you're in Christ so many times the Bible talks about making people a twofold child children of hell because we bring them in and we have nothing to transform them come on it's 1 30. I'll meet you in there that'll be the third pool and in the beginning it would be just brother Branham and just that angel of the Lord that light I'll meet you in there I said why here was a man whose entire Ministry had been public why in there and here's what he said well it won't be a public show like the other what other first full second pool now in our mind we'd like to see more first pool and in our mind we'd like to see more second pool there'd be nothing wrong with that there'd be nothing wrong with telling people what was wrong with them that's a gift of the spirit a word of knowledge anybody with me no I don't know who I'm I feel like right now this just right here I feel like I'm preaching to people I'm not even looking at I just feel something almost Supernatural Happening Here Among Us this morning he knows what he's doing there's nothing wrong with first pool we we need uh I think that when you're able to by the word of knowledge tell somebody what's wrong with them I think it builds her faith I think it causes them to believe more than they were believing it sets an atmosphere but it's just a tool on the way second pool telling people their names don't you know your name stay with me don't you know your name do I really need to tell you what's wrong with you didn't you wake up this morning didn't you know when you got out of bed were you hurt I'm not I'm not making fun I'm going to function in any look here I feel this is how I feel Lord I'll do anything you want me to do if you want me to somehow tell somebody what's wrong with them I'll tell them if I need to if you want me to tell them their name it's happened it's happened next time you see Kevin McGregor ask him if it happened it's happened a time or two you ever hear from John Kuhn ask him if if it happens it happens happens if God wants me to tell or you you to tell somebody their name we're open for that but but the charismatic world has got something missing because they think if we can just get back to that place where we can tell people what's wrong with them they already know and then they if we could just get back to to where we could tell people their name and their and their address and and that's all right but that's not enough [Music] because there was more than a first pool and more than a second pool there was a third pool the first pool can be impersonated the second pool can be impersonated [Music] the third pull cannot be impersonated you can't fake that life you can fake the noise you can hoop and holler and carry on shout the loudest holler amen the loudest run the fastest dance the best but you cannot impersonate that third pool Ministry because that's you and him and part of that third pull I'm getting ahead of myself I'll have to finish this another time part of that third pull is bitter belly syndrome we're hard trials hard tests come on come on you see Popoff was here he was down here in Columbus some years ago they caught him impersonating the first pool this is not it was public knowledge he had a transistor remember this was years ago he had a transistor receiver in his ear and a little set behind the cat curtain and somebody working two or three people working the crowds we're so glad you came tell me about yourself what's your name are you sick did you need to be prayed for what's wrong with you my that's a nice yellow dress you have on sister and so he's hearing this in his ear then he comes out on the stage and he says you there some uh somewhere oh that yeah they're they're you sister there with a yellow dress that first pull they found out the city fathers they they contacted a lot of people come in they ran him out don't you ever come back to Columbus Georgia again now they've had kiss and everybody else after that you know the rock music and all but not not no charlatan fake preacher you know so the first pull can be impersonated brother Brandon was using prayer cards he never saw the prayer card he never held the prayer card he would have people to write it down as a witness but never see it and locked away and sometimes remember they tried to fool him and they wrote a bunch of things on a Prayer card they didn't have and they came through the prayer line thinking brother Brandon would name the things they thought he was cheating they thought he was a charlatan they thought he was faking and instead he walks over and he discerns there's nothing wrong with you there is nothing wrong with you but everything you wrote down on that prayer card you now have you can impersonate the first pull you can gain information about people sister Dorothy I don't know why I'm calling your name but we've been through some of this haven't we people we loved people we we respected and loved but they get off a little they they get under something and they start cheating [Music] it's dangerous yes it's dangerous but they start impersonating and cheating it and then they get over there and they so it's easy to impersonate that first pool you just gain information and you feed it back to the people in the name of the Lord here's the thing you must never forget God healed to many a person I want to make sure you understand because some of us have lived this and we saw it with our own eyes I've seen God heal many a person real heal real healing real Miracle under a phony preacher why would God do that because he honors his word and because he honors faith and because the anointing falls on the just and the unjust and because the gifts and callings of God are without repentance [Music] and a man can have a genuine anointing and a genuine call from God and be used falsely because he's false but the anointing that falls on a false vessel can be a true genuine anointing from the Lord and that's why it's not the false anointing it's not the false anointed it's the false anointed ones it's the people it's the life that's false but the anointing can be genuine and that second pool then you start start picking up there's many many ways look I don't want to get into them but there's ways that you can read someone and learn to read them and say something to them and by their response begin to figure things out so both first pull and second pool could be easily faked or impersonated but then there's the tent then there's the third pull then it's you and Jesus inside that place nobody and not you and the preacher in Jesus not you and the prophet in Jesus not you and brother Branham and Jesus just you and Jesus just you and the pillar of fire and inside there nobody's looking it's not a public show and when you pray you enter into the closet and close the door [Music] it's a secret place it's a place of intimacy it's a place of nakedness you can't hide anything then it's all in his eyes and he loves you more not less he sees your flaws and loves you more because you surrender to him and let him change you it's bitter in the valley sometime when this happens when that word gets down in there and starts correcting your life and telling you that I won't tolerate that no more you've got to make some changes in your wardrobe changes and your vocabulary changes it's not always Pleasant is it he said well it won't be a public show like the other and I came to it too and I now at the beginning of this New Year back to my Tabernacle where I started from see back to the beginning where I started I'm very grateful to God for these things and and many of you know that just before leaving on the other Crusade about eight or ten years I think about 10 years since nine years something like that these things were told exactly how the auditorium Services you remember exactly how brother Lawton would live exactly three years and then be taken away and brother Ward would build a tabernacle down in this position this direction and all just exactly you know you Old-Timers it happened just that way and so will this yes he's just pulling some history to show them this is what God did then and if he did it like that then it'll have to be like this now he said it happened just that way and so will this for it's thus saith the Lord and I want to emphasize the last three words because this is not just brother Branham in this reference as John was a type of the Bride brother Branham is serving in this as a type of the Bride John caught up brother Branham caught up to see something that wasn't happening in the natural and I want to emphasize those last three words and I'd like for you to read them out loud together please read it again and you'll know and now as I believe that at the brink of the greatest meetings I've ever held for the Lord Jesus is laying right in the future beginning now so you know I feel very happy this morning to come before you and this is the first time the message has ever been given out it's right here on this through the microphone to the Tabernacle people he's telling this vision and now it'll be in the papers the religious papers the voice of healing Herald of his coming in a few days it's already tight and ready to go pray for me now did you make it through that all right good I have another one I need to share with you before we go we're studying today we don't have a climax the climax is yet to come but I have to give you this in paragraph 389 of is this the sign of the end sir are you still here do you need to stand up and stretch a minute it's 142. no no answer does that mean you're okay does it mean you'd like to stand up and stretch do it if you want to if you want to just pop up like a pop over just jump right up and stretch it's like a jack-in-the-box no takers paragraph 389. could it be or the seventh ain't angel in the seven constellation seventh period constellation their pyramid made in a form three on Assad and one on top three three and one dropped from eternity could it be he's describing the experience on the Sunset Ridge are what we call the sunset Mountain is he goes on is this the mystery of the Thunders that will bring back the headstone you know the pyramid never was capped could we read this sentence very carefully out loud together The Headstone is yet to come let's do it again The Headstone is yet to come when was this end of 62. so by the end of 62 The Headstone had not yet come and capped the pyramid we know that it's been rejected anybody remember the transvision it's been rejected a hand came and pushed that Cornerstone away that was to become the Capstone could it be Brethren sisters or is this that third pull that he told me three or four years ago the first pull you remember what happened I tried to explain it he said don't do that the second pull he said don't try and I pulled anyhow you remember congregation says yes all of you remember it's on tape and everything it is because I just read it to you didn't I and then he said now there's a third pool coming but don't try to explain it brother Branham was specifically forbidden to explain the third pull that doesn't mean that the bride shouldn't know what it is it means that brother Branham was specifically instructed not to explain it there is a bride re-digging the wells boring yes I gotta know it you see how I approach this tonight I don't know but I feel Duty bound to my I feel sorry for you people being here this long with a subject that's so tedious you see how I approach this tonight I don't know but I feel Duty bound to my church to say something you draw your own conclusion I find that an interesting statement uh especially around a bunch of people that say say what he said say what he said say what he said say what he said say what he said only what he said say what he said every word is thus saith the Lord say what he said and here is him saying you draw your own conclusion oh my brother Brandon believed that people could think he believed people could pray he believed people could hear from God they didn't get their orders from voice of God Incorporated they got him from the messenger well that was quiet they didn't have to get a Saturday text to tell them who they are and where they're going Friday went either now there's a third the third explain it you see how I approach this tonight I don't know but I feel Duty bound to my church to say something you draw your own conclusion and he goes on now will this be the mystery that would open up that would bring Christ bring a power to the church see we've we've already we believe in Repentance being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ we believe in receiving the Holy Ghost we have signs wonders Miracles speaking in tongues and the things that the early church had and frankly there's been more done right here Vince wrote In the book of Acts that's powerful statement to make I'll tell you brother random made some pretty incredible statements he said about those little prayer calls he said I've had more success in my Ministry with those little prayer calls and I did with prayer lines bet you want one now thank you he said there was more happened right here in this little group of people than you read about in the book of Acts he said that one in this one little group of people this little bitty Ministry of ours here what about the world over see more than is wrote In the book of Acts same kind the raising of the Dead remember there was only about three people raised of the Dead by Jesus Christ and we have on record doctors record five that's Greater Works that's what Jesus said let me go into my father let me get on out of here I can do more from there than here you're going to do works that you've seen me doing Greater Works if I can get out of here isn't that what he said you see the bride will have a greater Ministry he was in one person then he's in the whole church now he said work said I do more than this shall you do I know the King James says greater but you couldn't do nothing greater he says it's more of it that's good that's greater he was in one person then he's in the whole church now see more than this shall you do for I go unto my father if oh yeah if this is the third pool then there is a great ministry lying ahead I don't know I can't say I don't know hmm let's go back let's go back I don't know I can't say I don't know a lot of my brethren say that was brother Brandon being humble you've got to read between the lines he's talking about his own Ministry I don't believe that I believe when he said I don't know I can't say I don't know I believe he meant I don't know I can't say I don't know because it's not all been revealed to me yet they believe a lot of people believe he's just being humble look it's too late it's uh it's getting late now it's too late it was too late then his ministry was coming to an end he didn't have much time just to put on some kind of humility he said I don't know is this a third pull then there's if this is the third bull there's a great ministry I don't know I can't say I don't know all right let's go on watch third pool that's paragraph 399. let's stop on that a minute in division the first flight was little messenger Birds this is sunset again was little messenger birds that was when we first started it growed from just taking a person by the hand and you remember when he told me if you'll be sincere it'll come to pass that you'll know the very secret of their heart how many remembers that announced from here and across the Nations and it and did it happen amen exactly then said Don't Fear I'll be with you see and it shall go on now the first pull was little bitty birds in flights they went on to meet the time meet the coming of the Lord the first message the second time the secrets of the heart that's the first pull second pool and he is connecting the three parts of the tent vision to the visitation of Angels in the desert remember when he first saw them he said they were like little birds he was even confused on how many there was to start with then they they were no longer just Little Birds now they're grown angels grown men like Angels hovering above in the one to my right remember what he said are you familiar with the with the sunset experience I can read that to you sometime we don't have time today why does it matter because we're fixing to walk in the rest of this stuff wait a minute I'm going to say that again from taking a person by the hand and just standing there and saying what they had the next time it revealed their sins and told them what to do let's go on uh is that right and then that come to pass perfectly just as God said in your my Witnesses and so is the world and so is the church and when I said I saw an angel and it was an emerald fire burning people laughed now he's using the word Emerald here he often called it Amber which is a very similar color golden brownish greenish he said people laughed and said Billy get get next to yourself or get a hold of yourself that the magic scientific eye of the camera took it I wasn't lying I was telling the truth god vindicates brother Brandon was almost driven to an entire nervous breakdown because of what the people were saying so God had to keep building him and building him I said Darkness overshadows it's death black and this is white and one is life the other's death and there it is on the picture back there he's talking about the photograph the pillar of fire as George g j Lacey said the mechanical eye of this camera won't take psychology are you following me so brother Branham truly believed that it was a supernatural being that was captured on that photograph he said notice and I'm almost done because I can't stand much longer notice the first little flight hand the second was greater wider doves Holy Spirit revealing the secrets of the heart and the third flight was Angels not birds and that's the end time that's all of it will this be the time brother is this the time not one time did he say this is the time every time he said is this the time is this what God is going to do he said now listen real close and don't misinterpret this I want to ask you something let's just go back a minute the church knows it's the truth the scientific world knows it's the truth and people sitting here tonight and many still living that we're standing here on the river listen 90 years ago today standing here on the river when that voice spoke out and said as John was sent forth with a message of the first coming so so this so is this the second message of the second coming remember he doesn't quote it verbatim here don't let that throw you off he's into something else and if it's finished what did John do John was the one who said behold there's the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world that's him it's the hour has it arrived my brethren if brother Brandon was under the same anointing as John the Baptist brother Branham knew what that was going to mean for him [Music] it meant he was going to have to go by the way of the Grave because John the Baptist had his head chopped off I must decrease he must increase that's why brother Branham has these questions he said is the hour hasn't arrived my brethren I don't say it has but I'm asking you I want you to think will this be the time when it will be again Behold the Lamb of God or the time of Malachi 4 to return the hearts of the children back to the Faith of Our Fathers will it be such a blast that will do such Mighty things until it will set the church has been sloping and cannot understand the mysteries of God and so forth slopping when they see the mighty blast sweep for when it turn their hearts back to the father as the Bible said it would do remember brother Branham was thinking that his death was coming in one or two places by explosion he said or was this the message already passed that should have done it ah I don't know but here's one thing he did know it's not two o'clock he knew that this is the sign of the end time sirs and he asked the people or is this the sign that it's over it looks very scriptural to me I don't know there were them Angels there was a blast like a thunder That Shook the whole Earth God knows I tell the truth just remember something is fixing to happen I don't know what it is but could this could it be this the reason I say this prepare yourselves let us pray take our position in the army of his Believers and prepare ourselves for it may be later than we're thinking time will not permit me to go on come musicians please the next one is really long too you'll have to come back and we will tie this together it's really loose it's really loose to leave it like this but I need to do that for your sake and mind but come on back because we're going to tie this third pool into every one of those phases that John experienced eat the book sweet in the mouth bitter in the belly prophesy again I know that some of us are tired I don't mean this morning I know you're tired this morning and these long-winded preachers that don't do nothing all week and lay around and rest and we're all worn out from work and then they come in here on Sunday and preach three hours and take their big check home and it's a whole lot more to it than that and you know it I'm being facetious I feel oh I feel him I feel him I know it's not a feeling but I feel him I feel him running up my forearms and through my elbows and into my shoulders I feel that presence of God moving like vibration around me Hallelujah to his name it's him it is not us it's not this church it's not you it's not it's him it's him this is what he has promised to accomplish in the end time we're going to come out of that little room we're coming out of that little tent just like him you see it can't be impersonated first pull yes second pool yes third pool cannot be impersonated you cannot hypocrite the character and life of Jesus Christ can't do it it'll show it'll show it'll show you can come to church and hypocrite it you can come to church and live so holy holy holy holy but somebody's gonna see you yeah that's real good for you I lay under my dining room table not not the one that's in my home now but the one that's most likely still sitting in Sister Jan's dining room that was my dining room table then she may not have it anymore I don't know but I was laying under that dining room table in my home in my dining room crying out to God in the wee hour of the morning some years ago when I saw a friend standing on the beach with another friend they were not facing me I caught the man's demeanor and shape and and and knew who he was I did not know at the time who the woman was until she turned toward me and when she turned toward me in the vision I saw who it was and I knew that she was a married woman and that this was not her husband God gave me I'm not boasting you can take this right out of the tape right out of the archive does it need to be here but God gave me the city he gave me the phone number I had a list of phone numbers given to me by an operator he highlighted the phone number by the name of the hotel he let me call that number ask for my friend and the room rang he is the same yesterday today and forever you'll somebody will find you on a beach somewhere somebody will see you off behind the store or parked in your car doing something you ought not to do somebody will smell it on your breath it may take a long time but you can't hypocrite this life forever be sure your sins will find you out so the first pull can be impersonated second pool impersonated but the life and character of Jesus Christ in its fullness can never be phonied it can never be faked it will eventually come out your temper will get the best of you your cheating will come out somebody will see it on your phone it you'll not be able to hide it so get out from under the pressure and run into the tent run into Christ hide with him let him change you from glory to glory from Faith to Faith from strength to strength there is a bride who will come forth in these last days from that tent just like him brother Brandon was seeing some of it this is what makes them so mad he was seeing some of it but he was not seeing all of it one of the reasons is he said if Satan gets a hold of this he could do much damage with this you hear Brother bam say I don't know I do not know I am not sure is this it I'm not sure if this is it is this the beginning is this the end I am not sure until Sabino Canyon he didn't know whether the explosion was going to be his death or whether it was going to be another installment of his ministry it ended up being another installment of his ministry that actually introduced the bride had it not been for that we wouldn't have really been introduced to the fullness of the word he had to come all the way through that so we could really know oh come on let's stand you've got to get real and I believe you want to I believe you want to I don't even know what to say or do now how do you how do you have an altar service I mean I don't know do you want to get saved shall we just
