to have its preeminence in this service the word is what we defeat the Devil with I would like to start in verse 13 of Malachi chapter 3 your words have been Stout against me saith the Lord yet you say what have we spoken so much against you you have said it is vain to serve God and what prophet is it that we have kept his ordinance and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts and now we call the proud happy yea they that work wickedness are set up yea they that tempt God are even delivered than they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name and they shall be mine saith the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man's Spirit his own son that serveth him then shall you return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word and you may have your seats today I want to thank you for being in the house of the Lord with us God willing next Sunday brother Shelley and his family will be back uh their sabbatical will come to an end they'll be back home with us God has been good to us let us worship together you have pressed in we've pressed in together to see what the Lord would do in us and through us for us while we've been together without our pastor and I thank you that you have been willing to press in and do your part to pull the anointing in to the service God has been gracious to heal our bodies to touch Our Lives to press us along when we needed pressing sometimes that's exactly what he needs to do is to just nudge us back into the path we get out of sort sometimes and God has to do some extravagant things maybe to cause us to get back into line but he is faithful he is faithful before I go on I just want to wish brother and sister man a happy anniversary they had an anniversary on Friday the Lord bless you [Applause] I don't keep up with birthdays but there's one that's pretty special to me tomorrow my granddaughter is already going to be a year old how did that happen we're thankful for her for the joy she brings in our lives we're thankful for the joy of salvation and for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and friends I want to tell you again how thankful I am for this message of truth that God has given to us it is a message that was given to us and 60 years ago God broke the seals to us he he gave us what we needed from that uh from the book he helped the book to be open to us it was not a man that opened it it was the Lord Jesus Christ the lamb it was slain from before the foundation of the world and it is our duty as Believers to study it out to find what there is in this book that uh is is going to help us now I've been on this journey long enough to know that there are some passages of scripture that minister to you more frequently than others there are some passages of this book that we read and we're greatly confused by them some of these uh books in the Bible especially in the Old Testaments those little Minor Prophets we have called them uh but they were prophets nonetheless they had a calling of God to prophesy to the nation of Israel and we don't understand a lot of what they said and it seems like that it doesn't have any application my wife asked me a few weeks ago she says why is it that you're in that in those in those Minor Prophets so much I said I keep going back to read them to find out what the Lord would say to me maybe I am I'm not yet in a season of time where that that passage is applicable to me uh for the journey that I am on but somewhere along the way God chooses to take a passage of scripture and make it real to us he wants to make it real in our lives and the whole book is for our edification the entire thing and and we have been told if you can't find the Lord Jesus in every verse go back and read it again well I'm having to go back and read it again because there's some places that I can't find how it applies I know it's there because I know that everything in that older Covenant pointed toward the newer Covenant it pointed toward Abraham's seed Christ Jesus and it pointed toward Abraham's Royal seed me you and that's what it was pointing to but ultimately it was the Lord Jesus Christ that it was pointing to and to help us to see that we're a part of the story we're a part of what he wanted to do in the end time and we have been born into an age the laodicean age where that it was lukewarm a lukewarm age where that everything is just kind of so-so if it feels good do it if you don't want to do it don't do it and everybody gets this lazy attitude I'll do it if I want to do it and if I don't want to there ain't nothing you can do about it and then we bring that same attitude into the church and we try to exhort the people to worship together and then we have this understanding that we can't get anywhere by striving and so we don't want to drive you to striving by our exhortation what we really desire is before that we ever come into this building before we ever come through that green glass door back there we want to have all of the dead cats off of the line we want to have all of our issues settled and if we can't settle them we want to be able to leave them outside of that door and come inside of this building not with a heart of striving but with a heart of gratitude and with a heart of understanding that I have come to Worship the Lord and I'm not going to strive to do it I'm going to yield to do it I'm just going to say Lord I I know that I've been rotten this week I know that I've had some mistakes and some misunderstandings but I cannot afford to let them be before my face as I come into your house I've got to let them aside because I've got to press into your presence without striving too many times we come in before the Lord and not just here but we go through our day I just felt like the Lord inspired me to back up to this this verse your words have been Stout against me your words have been Stout against me and those of you that were here on Tuesday night this word stout is the same root as if when Pharaoh hardened his heart against the words of Moses or against ultimately the word of the Lord when Moses came in before pharaoh and Pharaoh says I don't have to do what you say and he hardened his heart and we have a book full of promises that God has given to us and our words have become Stout against the Lord we have really hardened our hearts at times against the Lord and we have used words that were Stout against him and we have said some of these same things what is the use what is the use why should I keep pressing why should I keep fighting why do I have to fight so hard when there's other people that it looks like it's so easy for them why why why and the words start becoming Stout against the Lord because we have hardened ourselves against the move of God to let him come and soften us so that our words can be something other than grumbling and mumbling and rather we want our words as I said a while ago we want to join our words our praise our gratitude our Thanksgiving together with the saints of God because we want the frequency to get where it needs to be now lest you think we're a bunch of Kooks frequency matters and I have heard Once Upon a Time that Enoch had a frequency had something in his voice that perhaps that was the way that he got the stones that there was sound that was made at the perhaps that was the way that the stones got into the pyramid in such a perfect shape because there was a frequency I don't know I wasn't there the Lord has not told me yes or no but this one thing I do know I have I have been in Services enough times in my life to know that there have been times that the frequency the sound the rumble the roar whatever word you want to use it has gone to a level where it started moving things there have been times where flags were flapped and popped and then there was a shattering of a of something in the spirit realm until the god came in and moved in a mighty because that the sound got right if we are constantly mumbling and grumbling we are creating a sound but it is a sound of negativity that is causing there to be a drawing of other spirits I don't know if you would remember when I've ministered back in December and I had a demonstration here about the light and how that when uh that there was a distortion in the color even though you could still see the light through that uh that glass picture when I dumped something dark into it you could still see the light but this is the kind of things that we do in the spirit realm when we allow words to come out of our mouth that are stout against the Lord that are hardness of our heart being portrayed out of our mouth we start causing our spirit to be distorted you see in the Book of Revelation and in the Book of Ezekiel both of these men went into the spirit realm they went to a place around the throne and there is a perfect color around the throne my God exudes in a perfect color and the Bible talks about this rainbow color that exudes out of the Throne of God it's a perfect color and when I as a Believer am carrying the nature and the character of God I am emitting these colors as well but there are times when my words my Stout words against the Lord they begin to distort my color and when my color is distorted I begin to emit something that draws demon spirits and as I am drawing demon Spirits I know this is a little much for some of you but as I am drawing demon Spirits then I am wondering why that I am fighting such a battle it is because then my words have become Stout against the Lord and I have allowed that perfect color that is bus that is supposed to be the part of a Believer it is now distorted and it is causing something in the spirit realm that I can't see with a natural eye but I can feel what's happening and then we start beating the air and we wonder why that we are in such a fix but it is because that God is calling a body of people into an hour where that we will be held accountable for Every Idle Word that comes out of our mouth we're getting closer and closer you see I don't know how to describe this in degrees but I believe as we grow in the grace and the knowledge of the lord we are held more accountable we are more responsible in degrees as God turns up that Notch however that looks like and we're responsible in more degrees for the words that come out of our mouth when we're a young Christian and we've just accepted the Lord Jesus God looks over a lot of our ignorance he looks over some of our stuff but as we are growing in Grace and knowledge God says okay that doesn't that I can't Overlook that anymore you're going to have to you're going to have to learn some lessons from that now because that we're believers we get Fiery trials we've discussed this over the past weeks we get Fiery trials and these fiery trials are not to destroy you these fiery trials are to prove you to see that you will come out on the other side with victory and then what happens is you come on the other side with Victory this gets turned up another notch now you're held more accountable the degree of to which you're held accountable it's turned up a notch it's called a test so that you can come out with a testimony you go through the fire so that when you come out the other side you are proved but what we find out as Believers the test never ends the one test ends but you go into another one it's the same way when these kids go to school as they're learning they get a test and then they start on the next chapter of the book and they have to learn some more and that at the end of that chapter they learn another they they have to take another test and the teacher has to make the she has to make the Judgment of whether she taught them well enough as she's grading the papers and everybody comes out with an F now the teacher has to back up and say are these kids not able to learn this or have I been a poor teacher but see the Holy Ghost doesn't have to do that because he's the perfect teacher he's perfect I am the one that's imperfect we as people are the imperfect ones so the Holy Ghost he comes back and he says well you passed that test so it's on to the next chapter I don't know about you when you went to school but as the next chapter came it got more difficult because I had already learned something in the previous chapter that was going to be a predecessor it was going to hold me to understand the next chapter and so I had to learn it and I needed to pass the test now there were some in the class that didn't pass the test and when they did not pass the test you could watch them through the next season as they became more and more confused because they didn't learn the previous chapter and so as they got to this next chapter because the teacher had to go on the teacher is wondering why and so maybe that student needed a private tutor or maybe a student could help them out on their level and they could give a nugget of some sort that would unlock the key to help that person to understand the chapter that they had just been through so now they could go on to the next chapter now as we're in a body of Believers and we're in this walk with the Lord and we understand that God has given us tests these fiery trials and he he is helped us to realize that we as believers cannot continue to be babies we're not in daycare anymore not in first grade not an elementary school see you go to the book of uh first John I believe and and John is talking and he and he says little children and then he says young man and he talks to the older man and then he comes back to the little children and the young man because there's different levels of understanding for all these groups and God has allowed us to grow and parents have to help their children to grow parents have to assist uh well here the mothers are the teachers it's going to say the mothers have to assist the teacher when the child comes home from school but you've got them all day but you're teaching them and maybe Daddy has to help to teach them something that maybe Mom can't explain just right that's where the LIE there is the fivefold ministry because all of these Ascension gifts the pastors the prophets the apostles the evangelists the teachers that they're all a part of these Ascension gifts and all that we bring to you is a word from the Lord that is built upon the apostles and Prophets foundation of the Apostles and Prophets is not going to move the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets remains but the Ascension gifts the five-fold ministry we have to go before the Lord and all of us are different and we all have a different way of administering our gift and giving it to you and some can take it from a teacher and and they have a hard time they have a hard time receiving from a fiery evangelist some people can receive from a quiet pastor and others one allowed Evangelistic kind of Pastor everybody receives different but the five-fold Ascension gifts by the grace of God we Ascend in prayer and in the throne room and we get something from the Lord and we come back down to earth and we present it but it has to be a grounded on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets so we give you what it is that God gives to us and you have to take it and you have to chew on it I have to chew on it even though I'm the one that is presenting it or whatever preacher is presenting it we chew on it we we uh try to allow the Holy Spirit to let it work in our lives as we desire it to work in your lives and under the anointing there are things that are said that when we get out from under the anointing we may not have realized that we even said it but it is all a part of the delivery system that God gives in the end time because he desires for every one of us to grow and so as we grow and what we used to get by with we don't get by with today and real true believers don't carry an attitude of what can I get by with today True Believers say Lord how can I yield today what it is what is it that you want out of me that you would like for me to yield to you today how can I become more like you and God takes you through these seasons of time where he lets you be a child when I was a child I spoke as a child I acted as a child I think we have enough children around here to know what children act like especially when they don't get their way then we begin to question Lord am I like some of those children when I don't like what you request of me that I throw myself in the floor and I beat my head against the floor and I flop my legs up and down and I say I don't want to do it I don't want to do it I don't want to do it and the Lord says go ahead lay there and beat your head against the floor if you want to you ever felt that way as an adult where you just felt like throwing yourself in the floor and just having a big temper tantrum against the Lord I have now I I have to be honest with you and tell you I don't remember doing that as a child I very well may have you could have to ask my mother Adam no don't remember did I did she say I did I don't know I don't know and I don't I don't really get that way very often but there are some times that God makes a request of you that you don't want to do and the struggle goes on on the inside of you and it boils and it boils and it boils remember brother Branham preaching about a message called letting off the pressure because a lot of times when God requests something of us if we don't yield it to him and we allow that thing to go around and around and around around in our mind we become like a pressure cooker and I've heard enough stories in fact I think my mother had one to explode the top and it ripped the range hood off there's massive pressure inside of that pressure cooker and things happen when that pressure is not properly dealt with and so it builds up and builds up until that container can no longer hold the pressure that's inside of it and something's going to give there's only so much pressure that that pot can stand and Friends there's only so much pressure that you can stand and then what usually happens is we blow up against those that were closest to we don't really mean to we may not necessarily want to but we don't let the pressure off properly God gave us a means to let the pressure off and that part of that is by praising him using your voice because the greatest battle that's ever been fought is right here and it goes over and over and over and for every round of the speech that you hear going on in your head that you don't let the pressure off it's going to go around again and it's going to build up another degree of temperature and it's going to build up another degree of temperature and it's going to build up and if you don't do something to let the pressure off Lord I Thank you that I am blessed and highly favored thank you Lord for letting off two degrees we have been called to havely participate with the Holy Ghost to let the pressure off yet our words have become Stout against the Holy Ghost because rather than giving him praise and honor and Glory do his name We complain that we're in the shape that we're in and it doesn't let all any of the steam off all we think it has we think it has but it hasn't really because the root problem is not dealt with we've got to deal with the root problem and so as we uh come closer and closer to the coming of the Lord as we come closer and closer to rapturing Faith and divine love we are going to be required by the holy ghost that our words are going to be required of us and Every Idle Word is going to be dealt with either make the tree good and it's fruit good [Music] or the tree evil and it's fruit evil I was not called to be an evil tree you were not called to be an evil tree you were called to be a good tree to bring forth good fruit and so we have got to actively pluck off anything that's rotten we have to allow the Holy Spirit prune why is so much in life so painful pruning yet God knows that this pruning is necessary you watch an apple tree my dad and my father-in-law both have apple trees that as these men have gotten older their apple trees have not been properly worked on they used to produce nice fruit but because that they can no longer get out there with a pair of pruning shears and keep that tree under control keep its growth down so then the tree gets bigger and bigger and bigger so the sap that comes up it's got to it's got to go to more extremities and so the fruit is not getting the nourishment that it needs because the tree has gone out of hand but if God can come along and prune us cut off those unfruitful branches things that have gone out of control this is what the fiery trials do this is what the Fuller soap does these are just different terminology for God doing things in our lives that causes the pruning process to be worked on on in US because he is not going to let you run away Wild you are not a wild horse you are not a mule you're a thoroughbred and a thoroughbred has got to be trained and this training requires a stringent process and it is it is not a feel-good process there are other people who are in a feel-good religion and that's all they'll ever have you weren't called to that I don't think I wasn't I wasn't called to that I was called to a higher calling where that the Lord would bring me into a place of perfection completion where that everything that he said in his word I say yes and amen I'm not squabbling and saying no that's not for me no that was Old Testament no that's that you know we're we're not going to discuss that because you know Paul said if if you guys don't want to do it don't do it but for me for me I want to take every word and I want it to be a completion process in my life and in order for that to happen I realize that it is necessary for me to go through the fiery trials I realized that God is he's not proven anything to himself he already knows think about that he already knows brother Joe sway he already knows he knew when job when Satan went in before him and and it was God's idea it was God's idea have you considered my servant job it was God's idea but job didn't get to see that conversation he didn't have no heads up the devil's coming God just gave the devil permission to beat you up and beat you up good job didn't get to know any of that God was working something in job but God had already seen the end of job he already knew the end and he knew that when Satan came before him he already knew the end of job's life so he could say yo Mr devil have you considered my servant job it just seems like a such an unfair process yet God knows you he knows me he knew Job and he knows what you can handle and he knows the end from the beginning all that stuff in between all those mistakes you made all that stuff you went through to get to today all that stuff God knew all about it but he didn't worry about all that in between stuff he knew your rough background he knew all the Uglies you were ever going to do he knew whether you were born in a Christian home he knew the Uglies you were going to do he knew all the Uglies I was gonna do yet he could see my end and he could say this is one that is going to go through fiery trials and those fiery trials are going to bring him out into a place where that he is in such a perfected complete State people are going to just be baffled that they could be through so many hard things in their life yet at the end they come to a completion in the Lord Jesus Christ it is because that he has already seen the end for you the devil can do anything he wants God knows that somewhere deep down inside of you you're going to have the same response that God said about job in all of those trials he never charged God foolishly now the Bible records some stuff that job said and it sounds kind of foolish to me I believe it was a week or so ago you remember I talked about Abraham the Bible said he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but what I read it looks like that he did some staggering to me you know that I'm just talking natural here but in the newer Covenant we're told that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God we read about job he didn't charge God foolishly now God had to yank a not in job where were you job you think you know so much you think you're so brilliant where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth where were you at now we've taken that scripture and we said I was with him and I believe I was but God was trying to make a point to job you think you're you think you've got so much Authority you think you know so much but where were you when I laid the foundation of the Earth when the sons of God shouted for Joy the Morning Star saying where were you at were you there helping me to make all that stuff God just wanted job to remember who he was but at the end God had some words about job God didn't uh job didn't charge God foolishly Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong given praise to God sleeping with Hagar bringing forth an ishmai stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief was strong given praise to God just being real being real I can dwell on that stuff just as much as I can dwell on all of my heartache and pain and your heartache and pain all the dumb stuff I've done all the dumb stuff you've done we could dwell on it if we wish to but what good does it do because I would rather look to the end of the story I would rather I would rather by faith reach to the end of the story and know that my story has already been written and I have a prefix Destiny and that prefix Destiny says that he is an overcomer he is one who lived in laodicea where it was lukewarm and they were blind and didn't know it and they were naked and didn't know it and they spewed all kinds of violent evil things and they just didn't really know what they were doing all the curse words became natural adjectives for everybody and they just kept on talking like it was nothing to them actors acting actor spewing vile vile words as they're leaving this world because there's no God conscience but we as Believers have a god conscience and we have had our stumbles we have had our struggles we have had those times where that we did ignorant things along the way yet we still hold to the word of God because it is the promise that has been given to me I have a prefixed Destiny and I will walk it out and my prefix Destiny says that the lamb was slain from before the foundation of the world and there was a book that was written by that lamb and in that book is a name and my name is in that book my name so we gotta allow God to deal with the heart problem we gotta Lao I know we worship for quite a long time but I would like to finish this today we talked about on Tuesday night we talked about pride and how pride has just taken over our nation well it has taken over the world Pride and pride because it is a prevalent spirit everywhere you go and because this is laodicea the age of people's rights everybody wants their rights and so I'm a proud American and I want my American Rights and pride Creeps in in all of these little ways and we see that the Bible tells us that Sodom there's their main sin was the pride that they had among them and God dealt with it and we see the pride you know I don't think it's any mistake that they called a pride parade The Same Spirit is pressing back into the earth once again it never died it it just changed Dwelling Places and now we see this Pride pressing into the Earth in this uh homosexual spirit and uh you know we've got all these all these initials say it gets longer and longer and longer all the time another initial and another initial to describe all of those that are involved in this Pride Parade but we would have nothing to do with that yet we allow Pride to creep into our lives we talked about Pride on Tuesday night being self-idolatry idolizing ourself because we are concerned that if we don't idolize ourselves nobody else is going to we're not going to get the prominent place or position that we desire to have if we don't build ourself up with with some kind of uh doing in words and and dress and all these other kinds of things that we do to try to build ourselves up to promote ourselves that's what Pride does self-promotion and if if nobody will have us then we self-promote because we want to be somebody everybody wants to be you know we see Pride in those that promote themselves but I remember when I was in school I think I've told you this once before there was a group of gals that term some of the upper echelon as snobs yeah it was when I was in school sister Beth but there was another group who had the same issue of Pride and they called they turned that word around and they called themselves the bonds you know you had one side of the track or the other so to speak but there was as much pride in those girls they called themselves the bonds as there was in the ones that were snobs that's true they were proud that they were raggedy they were proud that they were poor they were proud that they were looked down upon and that drives that Spirit of that Gothic spirit there's a pride in that goth spirit that they want to dress in all black they want to put on black lipstick and black eyeliner black eye shadow and they just want to be dark dark dark because there's a pride in it and pride gets in every Avenue of life even the ones who looks like that they don't have any Pride they still deal with pride in some way and God has to deal with it they're proud because they're able to hide and stay back from everybody and they don't have any responsibility they're proud because that nobody calls on them to do anything they're proud because of this and proud because of that but God deals with pride because it is whether you're rich poor whether you got stuff or don't have stuff it is a spirit of self idolatry you are idolizing the place that you are God grant us the grace that we allow the burning fire of the Holy Ghost of burnout every bit of pride in our lives until that there is none of it left and we all walk humbly before the Lord be because I still believe what I preached some time ago from Philippians sorry I gotta find it because I want to quote it correctly let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus what was the mind of Christ who thought who being in the form of man or form of God rather thought it not robbery to be equal with God let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God now if you stop right there God told me to have the same mind as he did he was in the form of God but he was said that wasn't robbery to be equal with God it wasn't but he came in the form of man he humbled himself as a man that is the word I want to dwell on he humbled himself you and I must find ourselves humbled before the very Living God who thought it not robbery to be equal with God but he made himself of no reputation he took on the form of a man he came and he endured all of the hardships of a man he was tempted in every way as a man yet without sin he gave the offer to you I'm giving you an offer now this goes back to that prefix Destiny and he knows all of the foolish stuff I did in between my start and my end yet he could put me a prefix Destiny he knew the end of all of it and he knew that I was going to eventually humble myself before the cross I was going to humble myself before the finished work of the cross I was going to allow the blood of Jesus Christ to cleanse me of all of my sins I he knew I was going to repent and repent and repent and repent and repent and repent and repent and repent and replant and repent and repent some more and some more and some more because he was going to continue to reveal my heart to me he was going to continue to reveal my motives to me and he was going to let a sure word come and that word would come as a sword to divide between my thought and my motive such a fine line that was going to divide between my thought and my motive because he was going to get me all the way to the end of my story that said he has come to completion so he takes me through all of this stuff fiery trials hurts betrayals disturbances distractions upsets anger rage bitterness unforgiveness lets me go through all of it so I can taste every bit of it and know how to react to it and after a while as he's letting me go through all of this he comes with a mighty word or of the Lord to me and he lets me see all of that nastiness that I have inside foreign and because that he is a god-rich in Mercy he extends to me the choice how many of you ever been in how many of you in this room have ever been in a horrible battle and God came and gave you a choice to walk out of it and you chose to stay in it now you may be sitting here saying what kind of a crazy fool would do that but I would dare say that every person in this room though you did not raise your hand you have sit in a service Once Upon a Time and God came with an atmosphere for you to lay down your heavy burden to lay down your Agony to lay down your bitterness your unforgiveness friends it's happened in every service now God has given us this opportunity as we press into praise it is happening every service that the atmosphere is prepared the atmosphere is made for us to lay down our heavy burdens and then the word comes along to give us instruction to be able to rebuild if we let go if we release something to him then the word comes because we can't let that place remain as a void when we say Lord you can have my unforgiveness now standing here today there may be unforgiveness in you that you say Lord I'll let you have it and you don't give it a hundred percent you may encounter it again tomorrow and you may have to again say I forgive now tomorrow you may not have the same atmosphere the same balm of Gilead the same soothing atmosphere that we've created today say I forgive and in the soothing atmosphere of the holy spirit that we had here today where you could say I forgive or Lord I let go of my anger against this person I let go of my bitterness that I've carried for the last 20 years the atmosphere was built for that we don't linger just because we want to linger we linger because we try to hear the voice of the spirit say and linger just another moment or two I'm doing something and that atmosphere that balm is just right for you to be able to say it but now tomorrow when you go out and you don't have all of this congregation helping to create the atmosphere you're going to come up against it most likely again tomorrow where that thing is going to come and it's going to try to get you to react in a negative way and now you have to with a spirit of of of of God in you you have to say I forgive I will not hold the bitterness I will not let anger take a hold of me I'm telling you that because if you can get a head start in the service where there is a right atmosphere where there is an atmosphere of love and kindness and forgiveness and beauty and balm and soothing if you can let go of a degree of that in that kind of an atmosphere it will give you a head start for what you may face tomorrow if you refuse in this atmosphere there's probably a good chance you're going to refuse when you face it by yourself but I'm telling you if you will take advantage of the atmosphere of the corporate body when an atmosphere is created for you to just say Lord I don't feel anything that those people are feeling yet I feel that the necessity I I know there are things that are in me and I just want rid of them you take the opportunity well what if I don't feel anything preacher what do feelings have to do with it I would dare say that most of the men in this room have to go to work tomorrow women included when you are supposed to go to work tomorrow there'll probably be at least half of us that say I don't feel like it yet we have a responsibility because the Bible tells us that a man that does not provide for his own house is worse than an infidel so it's a necessity that we get up and go to work provide for our homes it's a necessity and it is a necessity for you as an overcoming believer to get your stuff dealt with wow the presence of God is moving Among Us because he knows the end friends now you can sit here and you can ball yourself up and you can fall up your fist and you can grit your teeth and you can say I ain't gonna do it but he knows your name he knows your name and he knows the end of your story he knows all that he's called you to go through but he knows the end of your destiny and he has your name written down and so it's a whole lot easier it's a whole lot easier to say papa I don't want to be defiant I just want to say yes Lord oh Pride Pride causes us to hold on to things causes us to hold on to things that we think that we have a right to but I would encourage you as believers don't let the spirit of laodicea take hold of you then they that feared the Lord speak often one to another this is verse 16. got to try to finish they that feared the Lord spake often to one another this word feared is reverential awe or to be awestruck I think some of our problems has been that we have lost the reverential fear of the Lord church has become common the preachers we have have become common the worship leaders and musicians have become common the way that we conduct the service has become common the atmosphere becomes common you say really preacher you just watch how much running in and out there is you watch how much running in and out there is when the presence of the Lord is here there are some that are sitting in this room that we're a part of this church in those early days when we first got here when the reverential all of the Lord would come down in the building and you would lose your spit you didn't move in the early days some here will remember that we weren't standing in a foyer talking before a service we were in the altar there was noise around the altar in preparation for a service now I believe that we should have some preparation before we ever got here but there's nothing wrong with making some noise in the altar before the service rather than talking about everything under the sun that has happened in our week letting our hearts and Minds be prepared and already setting stage for a higher frequency than maybe we could gain if we just talked about the weather and talked about baseball and football and what the children did and where we went and how much we weigh and what we ate for dinner last night and all of these kind of things people we talk about everything they that were all struck by the Lord speak often to one another what are you talking about it's a question to us what are you talking about because things have become so common to us it doesn't thrill us anymore the things of God that thrilled us when we were new believers or when we first came here they don't thrill us anymore and we're not as all struck of the Lord as we used to be because we see this one's flaw and we see that one's flaw and we see our own flaws and we see the others flaw and we see our own flaws and all of this stuff just gets going and going and it's what we talk about it's what we talk about and these are the things that have become Stout to the Lord these are the things that have caused us to become hard-hearted before the Lord because we're talking about all of that stuff that has no Eternal value but they that feared the Lord speak often to one another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written now a thought came to me earlier this week if there is a book of remembrance that was written because the Lord hearkened and heard how many blank pages do I have because I don't think he's writing down all the nonsense all of the foolishness he's not writing down the football scores he's not writing down what I had for lunch yesterday he's not writing down the temperature and whether it's sunny or cloudy he's not writing any of that down those that were all struck by the presence of the Lord those that were sharing the goodness of the Lord let me just stop here just a moment to share the goodness of the Lord and I want him to share it when he comes the next time but our brother that has been driving so far he gave a testimony last week that two months ago in in February the meeting that we had the Saturday and the Sunday his daughter was in the hospital dying the systems of her body were shutting down and I want him to tell you all of the details because it's profound what the Lord did and he said there's nothing that I can do the doctors are working on her but he said he told his daughter he says I'm going to Alabama to worship to find favor with the Lord for your healing before he got home his daughter was home with no tubes that is the goodness of the Lord God hearkened he heard brother Byler brother Emmanuel Byler when he told his daughter I'm going to Alabama to worship I can't fix you but I can go Worship the Lord and I can get the ear of the Lord I can get the ear of the Lord and a book of remembrance was written because brother saw that God did something fantastic something marvelous because that our brother feared the Lord there was a reverential awe brother became awestruck by the power and the anointing of the Holy Ghost that gets created in this place and he knew that he could do more good by getting in the presence of the Lord and then he shared that over a meal there's something that's been going on in me ever since this is the kind of things that the people that are all struck by what God is doing that's what they're talking about that's what's going into the book of remembrance that is the things that are being recorded on my behalf this book of remembrance that is being written and those that thought on his name shall see hear not only what we're speaking but what we're thinking and we said on Tuesday night we referred to the scripture out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks Philippians 4 verse 8 finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest we are not going to continue to get away with being dishonest how many times have I heard my wife talk about her mother saying to them when they would tell a lie all liars shall have their place in the Lake of Fire now I realize that God is a god of Grace and there is a time that he Winks at how ignorant we are there are times where that he would allow us to get by with this honesty but friends I would remind you of of of the New Testament when uh ananias and Sapphira came in before Peter and Peter says why has the devil allowed this to come into your heart that you would lie to the Holy Ghost I personally do not want to be the one that has to pronounce that judgment but I remember profit from our generation using two instances that he tied to ananias and sephira and one of them was that a man came into the prayer line because he wanted to prove that brother Branham was using mental telepathy and he wrote all kinds of things on the back of his prayer card that were wrong with him and right before the people he tried to dispute with brother Branham and brother Branham said there's nothing wrong with you the man starts saying you're a fake you're phony you ought to read my prayer card and brother Brandon says it doesn't matter what's on your prayer card there's nothing wrong with you all of the sudden the spirit of the Lord drops and said you've lied to the Holy Ghost you didn't just lie to a man you lied to the Holy Ghost you're trying to prove that I'm a fake that I'm a fraud but now all of those things that you have written on the back of your prayer card you will now have them now I'm just going to tell you friends in my mind it would be a lot less painful just to fall dead and be carried out but now this man had to live the rest of his days with all of the things that he wrote tuberculosis being one of them all the rest of his days he had to deal with all of these problems in his body because he lied to the Holy Ghost the days of our playing around are quickly coming to an end it is high time that we awoke out of sleep our place of stupor and allow the Holy Ghost to extract from us that lying spirit that we carry the dishonesty that we have dishonesty that we have in paperwork even that we fill out how many hours that we've worked on a job dishonesty with what we have taken out of inventory dishonesty with what we said to someone along the way finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report whose report will you believe I will believe the report of the Lord when I'm in an atmosphere I'm human when I'm in an atmosphere and there's something wrong there's something about good atmosphere that you just want to decree a good report when you get out from under that atmosphere you have this temptation to go back to spouting the bad report when we're in an atmosphere of faith we can decree faith and we can decree healing we can decree all the good things of God when we get out from under it we revert back to our bad report our struggles but the Bible is telling us whatsoever things are true honest just pure lovely of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things oh now this sounds like a new thought pattern and it ain't coming automatically because we're a bunch of humans with a human nature yet God allows us to come together service after service and experience his presence and he continues to give his word to us so tell us we got to get rid of the stinking thinking we got to get rid of these things that have cost us so much struggle we've got to think on things of good report we've got to think on things that are honest we've got to think on things that are true we've got to allow our minds to think in a pattern of Truth and if we elect if we Let Jesus Christ The Living Word the person of Jesus Christ the person of truth if we allow him to embody us our thought patterns will become different so after we're thinking on these things he tells us that those that think on these things he says these are mines saith the Lord these are mine and in that day when I make up my Jewels I will spare them as a man's Spirit his own son that serveth him then verse 18. see all of these things are moving us toward Verse 18 then you shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not when we think on things that are lovely things that are of good report things that are honest things that are true when we think on these kinds of things and then we get together with one another or what we're thinking on the word we're thinking on Truth we're thinking on Jesus Christ and we get together with our friends with our loved ones with our family we're sitting in our homes and we're discussing the goodness of God in our lives as we're thinking on these things rather than filling our minds with everything else this book of remembrances being written about us as the Lord is hearing all of this stuff and there is a shift in us a shift a shift a shift a shift a shift that is happening in us and then as we are returning see this was an ongoing prophecy as I've told you this was for the children of Israel those that had wandered away from the things of God this is for us as well because as we allow the Holy Spirit to give us the grace to think on things that are lovely and true and of good report we're thinking on things that are righteous we're thinking on things that are good then our discernment is going to change we are no longer going to be one of those that says about the Heathen that never goes to church but he loves the Lord if we really love the Lord we are going to love on the Lord now I'm not putting anybody in hell I don't have that good a judgment there will come a day I will sit with him in his throne I'm planning to sit with him in his throne because I am an overcomer even as he overcame and sat down with his father in his throne I am going to overcome and I'm going to sit with him in his throne and I recognize in Revelation 19 that there's going to be some people that are Before the Throne giving honor to the Lamb's wife in the throne and it's two groups of people there are going to be people that make it by the skin of their teeth or the plaque thereof I don't know how you want to say it there will be people who will overcome the spirit of this age they will lay aside their rights they will lay aside all of the foolishness they will lay aside all of that because they want to be just like Jesus they will recognize that they are carrying pride and they will take it before the Lord and say Lord I don't want this I give it to you I I I I I want it to go back where it came from I realize that I can't be like Jesus if I'm all the time trying to promote myself and make myself something that I'm not uh or just even even a a false pride of some sort that tries to you know that that you know pride comes in so many different forms even even our uh our pity parties our pity parties are born out of Pride because we want somebody to see that we're miserable and we've got to surrender it to the Lord our pity parties that come around because we've been injured we've been wounded we've been hurt we've been this we've been that friends we all have been and if we can just God I am yours and that is sufficient and I want to think on the things of the word of God because I am your Jewel the Kingdom of Heaven musicians are coming the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a treasure hid in a field the witch when a man is found he hideth and for Joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he had and buyeth that field again the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he has found one pearl of great price when and sold all that he had and bought it at you you are so valuable to the Lord that he could not stand to leave you where you were so he gave everything he stepped out of Eternity into the realm of time and when he stepped into the realm of time and he took down the form of a human being and he took on all of the nature of a human being yet without sin he took on all of the sin he carried it he bore it to Calvary he hung on the cross with all of my sin with all of my shame with all of my condemnation and so I don't have to sit around and discuss all of my sin and my shame and my condemnation and my guilt I don't have to sit in my easy chair at the house and allow that gerbil will to go around and around and around and around and around around until that the pressure cooker is about to explode I can adjust as I do when I come in here with you corporately I may not be able to create the same atmosphere that I do when I have all of you but I have the ability I know that I have the ability by the grace of God and you do too you don't have the ability to create my atmosphere but if I'll create an atmosphere and you'll create an atmosphere and we can join it together that creates the corporate atmosphere yet when I am alone I have the ability because I have the Holy Ghost I have the ability to create atmosphere in my vehicle in my easy chair in my office and I'm realizing by this scripture that I cannot do it just by thinking about it I have to speak and it is a gift that I can talk to my brothers and sisters about the goodness of God and the more that we discuss the goodness of God the more that we discuss the presence of the Lord the more that we discuss the word of God the message of the hour all of the good things that God is doing and our eyes are being adjusted we're getting the proper eyeglasses in place to be able to see wow my eyes have been open that that situation right there I realized that I was calling that good when in fact it's evil and this situation over here because I'd been discussing so much about football and basketball and I'd been so carried away with providing for my family and I had been so carried away with my mistreatment by my boss that this over here I was calling bad when really it's good when we can talk often to one another recognize that I was foolish enough to agree with stuff by an intellectual mind the pruning the refiners fire that all of that is a part of this then I can know that there is a return of the true Discerning between righteous and wicked and between him that serves God in him that doesn't let's stand together today if there is anything if there's anything that we would want to ask the Lord for today as we're worshiping together may we ask him for Discerning of spirits God I don't want to discern things by my own flesh I don't want to discern things even by my soul my mind my will my emotions because emotions can get out of sorts if I allow the Holy Spirit you ready Ben if I can allow the Holy Spirit to come to me by the word buy things that are righteous and of good report I let him tweak my eyesight my righteous eyesight till that I am one who allows him to cause the Discerning of spirits to come in a profound measure in my life to where that I am giving righteous judgments and what is evil I am calling evil I don't have to stand behind a Pulpit and make a big to do about it but friends there's a whole lot of stuff that we agree with that we should not agree with there's a whole lot of stuff that is so edgy that we agree with because that our hearts and our minds have become distorted by laodicea oh God I am praying today that you will let there come such a flood of your Holy Spirit in our lives and in the atmosphere even now right here as we begin to worship you I am asking Lord that you will come and seal in this word and that we will recognize the foolish talk that we have had the foolish thoughts that we have entertained and all of the ideas that we have entertained God as it has caused us to have distorted Vision that we have called what is evil we've called it good and what is good we've called evil oh Lord let there be a return as you promised in Malachi let there be a return of the Discerning of spirits
