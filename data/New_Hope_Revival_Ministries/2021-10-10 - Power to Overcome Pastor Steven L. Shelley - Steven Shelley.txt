report to you i just looked down and saw this note it is sitting the the principal offering given thus far is sitting at 140 000 and we are so grateful to the lord for this what a what a great blessing the lord is faithful before our pastor comes today i would just like to take a moment to say a word or two through the years being a pastor's son i have seen a lot of stuff and when we moved to virginia the word appreciate was shortened to appreciate and when people would come up and shake your hand they would not say god bless you or i love you they would say appreciate you this became a phrase that i did not like because it seemed to be just a a greeting of sorts that was kind of um generic didn't really like it and so through the years we remember matthew mueller and him telling a story about something and using that same phrase appreciate you and i just don't really care for it but today is pastor appreciation sunday and i would like to say i love you and i appreciate you so much [Applause] praise the lord [Applause] thank you jesus i thank you lord i thank you lord you may have your seats again i have been here 25 years but he's been preaching the gospel longer than that

that makes us free if we'll allow it to it will make us free if we'll allow the truth to do that in our lives i am thankful for the stand that brother shelley has made through the years that he has uh held on to this truth that we love so dearly and i'm grateful today to be able to call him pastor god bless you god bless you so much will you stand with us as brother shelley is coming to minister

here this morning isn't he i'm just going to think about peanuts the next time and i'll never forget carter's name again we had a president named carter we're still trying to forget that in fact it seems like we're there again these remind me of those days today is a very very very very very very special day because one of the seniors in our church the most senior member of our church for a long long long time she has been with us she came here her husband sent her with the girls many years ago and she never left and she has been a faithful faithful blessing in our lives and sometime when we're not pushed for time i will tell you some of you don't know i realize there's a generation of you that don't even know the sacrifice that she made for me she called me pastor son and she made a sacrifice for me many many many times to keep me on the road when i was young enough to travel all the time and strong enough to do that and they would literally i'll just tell this part they would literally load the it's against the law now i guess but they would should i tell that they would load a recliner bin in the back of the van and come and take me somewhere to preach and i i would get through preaching and get in that recliner and sleep on the way home so i could preach here the next day and she would sometimes meet me atlanta airport take my suitcases from me check me in i would check in a hotel for the night she because i'd fly out early the next morning her and the girls would come home this is before i was married and they would wash my clothes re-iron them re-fold them re-pack them and before i was able to get to the airport the next morning hand deliver them to me now that's how much they loved me and that's how much they loved me and they played a very important role in part of the ministry and today sister isabel weems is 85 years old and looking really blessed would you all wish her a happy birthday today praise the lord [Music] 85 wow my my mind [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so many memories sister tebo today is your wedding anniversary and although brother tebow is now in the presence of the lord and we still miss him we still celebrate you today and we know what a miracle and a blessing your marriage was to each other how god used you both for each other and how the lord rescued you both that was his goodness he reached out to brother billy first and then to sister tebow and then to brother tebow but god wasn't through reaching until he got them all so we want to say happy anniversary to you today lily has a birthday today how old is lily today three years old lily yovich is has turned three today let's say happy birthday to her i don't know what it is about wednesday of this week but that we just have a list of birthdays all on the same day elizabeth ellsworth has a birthday on wednesday and i understand that it's a big one they come in decades you know so if this is 30 she'll have another big one when she's 40. but uh may god what's that oh there she is i was wondering where you was you just wanted everybody to know you're 30 you did tell me to tell everybody didn't you i thought you did i must have misunderstood and rebecca hawks and rebecca hold up your hand you've got a birthday this week but i don't believe you're gonna be 30. what what is your age coming up nine years old god bless rebecca sister more reigns has a birthday on the same day we're not going to even she don't have to tell us nothing although we know and brother steve polk who's not here this morning but probably streaming the service he has a birthday all the same day now that's a lot of celebrating and then crystalline who's not well this morning and is at home is having a birthday next saturday so we want to remember to pray for her that god will touch her body and make her whole she's really suffered this week and but her trust is in the lord and we're believing god to to take care of her needs amen would you stand i need you to help me this morning in the word it's life to us and if you pull then we can move quicker and i would like to do that for you if possible today brother greeley will be ministering for us next sunday looking forward to what the lord will speak through him and we're thankful for all of the giving toward the principle of the church it's miraculous god blessed us with sixty acres they have not yet reached the fullness of their destiny but they will because the promises of god are yea and amen hallelujah i want to thank the musicians for everything you've done and god bless you this morning and i i was going to sing sister tebow a song but i'll do it next time i'll hold it because we need to get to the word john chapter 16 and verse 33. these things i have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace shalom now that's not the greek word that's the hebrew word but this is the kind of full piece complete peace that is described by the hebrew word shalom these things i have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation i think that sounds prophetic it sounds like a declaration or a prophetic word in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world this is red letter this is jesus talking he said i have overcome the world i'm not promising you that you won't have trouble but i'm telling you that i have overcome it all on your behalf and you can take your rest in me i'm going to release peace to you now i want you to know this morning there is a peace that passes all understanding and endures forever and that peace is a gift from god it's not the absence of trouble it's a gift of god it's tangible his peace is alive and it comes with his life the amplified version says about this last phrase it says i have deprived it king james says i have overcome the world the amplified says if you drop all the way down to the brackets at the bottom it says i have deprived it of power to harm you [Music] and have conquered it for you let's read that phrase again i have deprived it of power to harm you and have conquered it for you this is what jesus has done on our behalf if you believe that same man bow your head with me just a moment father i thank you for the holy reverence that's in this house right now i sense somehow in my heart that you are here today to speak to somebody and because i'm one of those who often needs to hear from you it delights me and it blesses me to know that you've come by this way with your presence because you have recognized a need the same as we read in the gospels he must needs go through samaria you sensed a need and you changed your program to fit and minister to that need i sense today lord that you have come by here because somebody has a need that needs to be ministered to i'm just a vessel all we have is the gifts that you've placed in our lives and the strength that we get as we press into you but you're the one who has the answer to every question you're the one who has the supply where there is a shortage you are the one that can deliver us from every power of the wicked one your name is to be exalted and your word is to be exalted even above your name and so lord i ask today that you will come for a few moments and anoint our ears to hear your word we're not looking for something new that we've never heard before we're looking for something that will speak directly to where we are and so we ask that you would come today we ask that your word and your presence would drive every demonic power out of this room in the name of the lord jesus christ i pray o god that you'll bring conviction to every heart that would sit down on your word for any reason even because of their own burdens and struggles because lord it's when we're in that place that we need your word more than we need it when things are going good it seems so come today and help us we pray it's in the mighty name of our messiah yeshua in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray and the saints said amen you may be seated this morning anointed to overcome anything this has been our theme for a few services now it started on the wednesday night of camp meeting and we've carried it over and i i think this is the fourth time that we're bringing the same subject and i had every intention this morning of moving on to something else i want to go back and finish up the seven offices of the holy spirit and there's some other things that are in my heart that i want us to talk about and we want to concentrate uh some on the end times the times that we're living in but i sense the spirit of god taking me back to this for somebody you see we never know who's going to be here we never know who's going to come by the stream i meant to mention a moment ago but didn't take the time to do that but we're receiving greetings now from all over the world god bless every one of you we're so thankful to have you joined with us and many are expressing their desire and wishes that they could be with us in person and when that is not possible we're glad for this technology we have no way of knowing who's going to fall on this stream we don't know who will see it in the archive i don't know how many maybe someone could get me a number i don't i think it's i don't know how many have downloaded the app but every day now people are downloading the app it's going all over the world every day people are connecting themselves to the different streams so that they can be notified when it's time asking about uh joining newsletters and so forth there seems to be a hunger that's being stirred and i sense that whether it's in this room or whether somebody will come by this at a later time i'm sensing that god wants to say to somebody today you can't do it by yourself but i've already done it on your behalf it's already a finished work i have overcome the world that world in the greek is cosmos and it means the order of existence it means everything that god has placed in his divine order in the earth so it means everything it means the world and it encompasses everything in the world all the people in the world all of the systems in the world the religious systems of the world it encompasses all of that when jesus said i have overcome the world he means just that there's nothing that i haven't already dealt with there's nothing that i haven't already risen to the top and overcome and i didn't do it because i had a need of it in myself but i did it because i knew there would be a people that would need that strength they would need that overcoming anointing they would need that power to overcome people are being overwhelmed all around us and fear you think that by now fear would be would be sort of diminishing but i want you to know what i have experienced when i'm in the public is that fear seems to be rising instead of diminishing and uh the tactics that the enemy uses to arrest people in fear they get slimier and slimier as the days go by the pressure that's being put on people and the guilt that's being put on people who have a backbone and who desire to swim against the current it's becoming evil isn't it and yet in the midst of all of that there is a pandemic that's greater than any kind of virus there's a pandemic of sin there's a pandemic of unrighteousness there's a pandemic of those who have forgotten god we live in a nation that's forgotten her roots she's forgotten where she come from we live in families that have backslid away from things that they have known to be right and the slippery slope is getting seemingly more slippery as the days go by it would be easy to question some of the things that we have held on through the years except that there's a holy ghost on the inside of the believer that says don't you turn loose of it now you've never needed the truth like you need it now you've never needed the power of god like you need it now so whatever you do don't turn loose of him because he's the only way out of here he's the only way through here he's the only way we can make it if you believe that same man so jesus is saying i have deprived this world of all of its power to harm you and i have conquered it for you on your behalf so you don't have to have a fear as a holy ghost believer you don't have to have a fear of the world being able to overcome you you've just got to stay in christ you've got to keep creating an atmosphere of worship and his presence comes in to that kind of an atmosphere we just keep cultivating that and feeding that and making him our priority and then he releases to us the anointing that we need to overcome anything and everything i recently encountered a woman whose arms and legs were scarred i don't mean just a few little scars i mean layer upon layer upon layer of scars on her forearms and her ankles because she spent most of her life harming herself she had gotten so addicted to not only the the thrill the the release of brain chemicals that happen when they're driven by that kind of a spirit and it becomes a something that you can get addicted to like a thrill seeker are you in me and they get addicted to the feeling that the brain uh releases when it releases those uh endorphins and chemicals and so forth she not only became addicted to that kind of a rush to that kind of a feeling but she began to be addicted to pain and so she didn't just do it for the superficial blooding i i know it's bleeding she didn't just do it for the superficial of of seeing the blood and getting some kind of thrill but she began to be addicted to the pain and one day the thought came to her i wonder what would happen if i could see the bone and so she began to continue to cut and to dig into her flesh until she could see the bone now you can imagine that her life is a miracle the very fact that she's still alive is a miracle because many many many times she learned to to nurse herself so that she didn't have to go to the doctor so that she didn't have to to be treated in a medical condition and when she was asked about this kind of a of a problem she tried to hide it the best way she could she wore a long sleeve she wore uh trousers she she did everything she could to hide it she didn't even want her children to really know that they'd been such a big part of her life but there was there came a time that she couldn't hide her secret anymore because she had a small child that she walked in on and found him doing the very same thing that she had done she had never showed him she had it had never been talked about in the family but the same spirit that had nearly destroyed that woman's life was now after the next generation are you hearing me and you say well are you trying to say that jesus has overcome that he has he has he has overcome everything and anything that this world can offer there's not an addiction that he didn't win the victory for already come on now that doesn't just mean substance it can mean sexuality it can be all kinds of things people can even get addicted to putting holes in their body it's the same kind of spirit don't get quiet on me now it's the same kind of spirit it's a symbol of slavery to a system that wants to destroy lives but i want to tell you something greater is he that's in this little bride greater is he that's in the life of the believer than he that is out there in the world and if the enemy is trying to take you under or take you down with anything i said with anything i'm here to tell you today that when jesus overcame death hell in the grave he overcame it for you when he paid the price for deliverance he paid it for you and all you have to do is enter into fellowship with him he has overcome i'm telling you there's no chance this is going to get a little sticky for for those who are still a part of church entity you may get a little stuck here i hope not but i want you to know there's absolutely no chance of me being overcome by the enemy somebody said you ought not to boast you want not to brag you are not listen folks here's what it is i learned a long time ago i can't do this anyway so if you talk about failure i've done it i'm a failure if you talk about giving up i've done it [Music] you talk about letting people down i've done it you talk about not being there when they i've done all of that and guess what i'm still standing and it's not because i've done anything it's not because i'm good at all it's only because i'm trusting in the finished work of the lord jesus christ it's only because he paid a prize on my behalf the prophet of god told us in this generation he said and that bride she cannot fall he said that doesn't mean that she won't backslide now you know the church out there teaches that if you're backslid you're lost but that's not what the gospel teaches the bible teaches that fellowship is broken but relationship never changes if you were a son of god if you are a son of god you always were a son of god and that's not calvinism that's god's election by foreknowledge he knew you before the foundation of the world he knew your choice and by that choice he gave you a prefix destiny you may fail you may be a failure for a season you may slide back you may pick up no harm sins you may pick up harmful things you may have relapses what else do they call it relapses and fell off the wagons and you may experience all kinds of hardships and trials but i want you to know the power of god that saved you in the beginning the power of god that rescued you before the worlds were framed is ever more alive it hasn't changed and he still has power to untangle the messes that we make and we have a tendency to make some pretty big messes sometimes are you with me all right i appreciate that be of good cheer i've overcome the world now i think it's important as i mentioned in my in my friday text i think it's important to mention that when jesus made this profession and he said i have overcome the world he had not yet been tempted he had not yet come to his place of of death he had not been beaten with a whip he had not been crucified he had not died on the cross he had not resurrected from the dead he had not ascended into heaven none of these things had happened in reality they had only happened in the mind of god jesus was about to face the darkest hours of his life he was about to look like a failure those who already mocked him those who already despised him they were about to have their fun with him and they were about to tell see there is he was once a leader he once drew the masses and now look at him he's just a tangled mess of sinew and blood he's been reduced from a king to worse than a piece of meat laying there in the street it looked to all of those who were looking on like he had failed but i want you to know he could not fail because before he ever went to calvary he'd already won the victory for you and i there was a lamb that was slain before the worlds were ever framed there was a lamb already bleeding before jesus was ever born in a manger there was already a lamb bleeding before he ever hung suspended between earth and glory the lamb was already bleeding brother the lamb was already bleeding and he was bleeding for you and me he was bleeding for those that he would call to salvation if you're saved today it's because you were called to it you're one in a million you may be a solitaire in your family you may be the only one in your house serving the lord you may have faced that at one time or another now it may not be so but you may have faced that at one time or another seem like everybody around you running in the other direction and you're running to christ seemed like everybody else was wanting to get high and do this and do that and do the other and you decided i want out of this i got to find a way out i can't get out by myself i got to find a way out and there you came to the lord and he saved you and delivered you and forgave you and set you free while everybody around you just kept going on the way they've been going the testimonies in this small crowd this morning would would marvel the minds of those who do not yet understand the power of the new birth [Music] you see i don't know at all i don't even like to know it all i'm a pretty nosy person but i don't need to know it all right i know enough about testimonies in this room to know that many of you were running with everything you had in the wrong direction and god arrested your path hallelujah i know there are people in this church who sow their bodies for sin i know there are people in this church who were addicted to drugs and addicted to alcohol i know people in this church that lived unnatural lives [Music] running as far as they could away from god and one day god was looking for them [Music] and he just started putting a hook out there and reeling you in somebody said i resent that you shouldn't resent that you should be thankful that you lost control you should be thankful that you surrendered your life to him and he brought you thus far and i'm telling you right now if he has kept you this far he'll be with you all the way to the end is faithful and he is true what do i have to do you have to keep saying yes not lip service but with obedience by laying down your life and obeying god's word if you're not baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you don't have all you need [Music] hello that don't embarrass you does it am i embarrassing somebody by saying the truth if you're not baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you don't have all the faith you need you haven't completed the steps of the new birth you need to follow him into the water take on his precious name if for no other reason to stand against a false religious system out there that encourages you to take on titles when the bible never said you're saved by titles he said there is a name that has been given whereby men may be saved not in titles but in a name and if you have not been sanctified by the washing of the water of the word if you've not found the strength to separate yourself from the pools of this world from the fads and the fashions of this world then you don't have all the faith you need you have not completed the steps of the new birth but he wants to wash you in his word he wants to anoint your yes anybody with me he wants to pour his anointing on your yes so that when the enemy tries to talk you out of it you just keep coming back and say no price is too big some little lady might come by and she might say you mean to tell me i i can't wear slacks you mean to tell me that i have to dress different and be different and and look different and sometimes we have a tendency to kind of sugarcoat and and say well you know the lord will take care of that he will he will it's not our place to try to clean the fish it's our place to catch the fish the word of god knows how to deal with people about their lives the greatest messages on holiness and separation are not the ones preached in the pulpit they're the ones preached in the pew the one preached at walmart the one preached at kroger when you walk in there like a little fish with a backbone sister swimming against the tide of humanity and saying i want to be modest unto the lord if i'm a married woman i'm reserving my body for my husband and i'm not going to hang it like a piece of meat on a hook and show it to the whole world anybody helping me the world is insane the world around us is being plunged into insanity and in the midst of this insanity as a backslid church system out there that can only promise you a doughnut and a cup of coffee but they're not offering much in the way of deliverance and they're not offering much in the way of truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free it will set you free you will be recreated in truth that's a powerful transformation it's a powerful metamorphosis if you'd help me we might get somewhere that's just 101 isn't it this is christianity 101. but i feel the holy spirit reaching for something i feel him reaching for something if you don't know you don't know if you've never heard you've never heard there's a truth out there that it seemed to me like there's a truth that that needs to be lived and it needs to be proclaimed and it needs to be demonstrated without condemnation to punish someone because they sin i'm going to miss i'm going to mistreat somebody because they sin and they don't really know what they're doing or understand the consequences of what they're doing i'm going to leave that to god i'm going to let god i'm going to reach i'm going to believe i've been reaching i've been reaching for some i'm reaching for somebody this afternoon i'm reaching because i believe that there is hope for help i believe there is power for deliverance i believe that there is strength to get out of the mess and the muck and the mire and the cesspool that we're walking through in this life and be filled with the power of god filled with the holy ghost and fire so i say to anyone who has this problem with with having to give up some things or live a little different than the rest of the world i say to you that if you understood the value of eternal life if you understood the value of eternal life what a gift it is one you could never deserve one that i could never earn and yet he went all the way anybody helping me it's not a little louder you don't have to a man just not a little louder if you can't nod then wiggle your toe a little bit just pull with me just a second because i want you to know that too many people don't understand the value of a soul [Applause] what would you give in exchange for a soul you know 10 million worlds my little well she wasn't little but i loved her my granny she wasn't little i didn't call her little granny i called her big mama that was her name to me my aunt and my uncle they hated it they said i can't believe you call my mother big mama and i said well my papa's the one who give her that name and and so i can i'm having a hard time breaking it there was nothing little about her but she had a lot of power she had a lot of faith she had a lot of holy ghost and uh she used to say if 10 million worlds were laid at your feet 10 million worlds and the value of 10 million worlds were laid at your feet it could never buy your soul your life so valuable in god's economy i i social media is so full today of people leaving here people passing it's not all coveted a lot of it is fear is taking people out come on now fear is taking people out but i see how families are being devastated there's a family there in in tennessee that lost a grandmother with the complications of a stroke and then a daughter this week also within a few hours of one another passed away with covid and it seems like every day you look here's another person and sometimes people post they say so and so lost their battle with cancer i tell you that one really gets me it's it's it's not believer's language you know folks that's not believers language oh brother so and so lost his battle to cancer you know what i've been doing i've been commenting on there and i don't say anything else except we're praying for you he won he won he didn't lose he won because if you believe what we believe in what brother greeley said today there's not a cancer in the world there's not a heart attack in the world there's not a demon power in the world that can take you out of here until god releases you to go you want to take care of yourself you want to preserve yourself you want to do healthy things to help yourself because you don't want to be in a condition that you can't enjoy the quality of life but i want you to know your days were written in a book the bible said before you were ever born all of your days were already recorded in an eternal book and one of these days we lost a pastor in arkansas in the message this week to cancer i mean to covet that was what's put on his death certificate covet but i know and you know that it was time somebody said brother i wasn't ready to give him up and the church wasn't ready when were we ever ready when do we ever get ready to turn loose of something that we love but i will tell you one more time this morning i refuse to serve a god whose enemy that he created is more powerful than he is that's the theology of the church well the devil took him out i ought to have some help i'm going to hurry somebody ought to help me oh the devil took him out oh she lost her battle to breast cancer oh he lost his battle this he lost his battle oh my my my he won was he born again was his soul redeemed by the blood of the lamb hey he graduated out of this pest house and stepped into eternity and you and i are going to make that crossing one of these days and we better know that we know that we know that every sin is under the blood that we are not trusting in our works of holiness or righteousness but we are trusting in the blood of the lamb that has made full atonement hallelujah hallelujah be of good cheer i have overcome the world i have deprived it of power to harm you and have conquered it for you somebody say amen now jesus in matthew chapter four if you'll go with me there a moment i need to i need to close i guess already matthew chapter four these little visitors are saying yes yes please cara was that you uh lena was that you i'm just kidding i know i've been in services like that where i was ready i was tired you know or i was ready to go and the and the people were saying no preach on you may not be in that channel but if you get in that channel if you never find that place and get in that channel it'll never seem like eternity to you again it'll seem like the very food that you that you need to sustain you and strengthen you on the way wanting matthew chapter 4 verse 8 again the devil taketh them up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them my there must have been a lot of value in those kingdoms there must have been a lot of glory in those in those kingdoms in verse 9 and saith unto him all these things you know this is a paradox this is satan a squatter he has no rights only thing he has is what was given to him brother branham tells us that the only power the enemy has against you is what you give him you know that i tell you that ought to open somebody's eyes but instead the religious mind says oh i don't think it could be that way it is that way his power is broken somebody said when you look around in the world it sure don't look like that that's because people are giving him the power he's just a squatter he's here on squatter's rights this earth doesn't belong to him he's temporarily been given authority as a prince of the power of the air he rules in the second heaven the only time he can work in this in this dimension is when we give him permission when we open a door when we allow him to and he doesn't have to fight fight his way in because we're all the time just yielding something to it you know it's the truth you're shielding to him but i find this to be such a paradox here is a squatter he don't have anything he doesn't own the kingdoms of this world he don't own the beauty of this world he doesn't own the value that's represented in these kingdoms here or the glory that's represented in them and yet he's got jesus god in the flesh fasting out there in the wilderness and here comes the enemy and he is offering him what already belongs to him who do you think has the bible said the earth is the lord's and the fullness thereof at any time jesus could have taken his authority over all the kingdoms and the glory of the whole earth but he just allowed the enemy that old squatter to offer him what already belonged to him if thou wilt fall that uh oh this ain't never going to happen if thou will fall down and worship me verse 10 then saith jesus unto him get thee hints satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve this is only one of the of the series of temptations that jesus went through the bible said in all men are tempted as we are yet without sin then what was the purpose of all that temptation i was the purpose you were the purpose we had to have a high priest that could be touched with the feeling of our infirmities we had to have a high priest who understood what it was like to live in a body of flesh though we were god in spirit he was flesh and he felt the pools of a fleshly soul the bible tells us so i want to i want to share a few quotations with you from the message of the hour in a message called and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy for those of you who don't know i'm quoting now from a man sent from god his name was brother william branham he was a prophet sent to the earth and we believe in prophets we believe in fivefold prophets and we believe that they're human and uh brother branham was a man and he he said i make mistakes and but he was a vessel that god used and i don't worship brother branham but i sure do appreciate the ministry i can tell you that when i found the ministry in the 80s i was walking in a whole lot more confusion than i knew i thought i'd just about come to know it all in fact i was in so much confusion that i didn't even know what the godhead looked like i didn't even have the right baptism come on but god used this man so i just wanted to because there may be some of you that don't know why in the world they're quoting for that man if you go to the lutheran church you might hear something from luther if you go the baptist church if they're conservative baptists they might quote from rice or or some of their great uh you know generals or or whatever you go to the wesleyan or methodist church you may hear something great from charles wesley or or john wesley and so don't be put off by this in fact uh you you you might be able to relate to it because he only had a small education he didn't he didn't know much about what devil double negatives were or having the right sense the right uh the the right uh uh predicate that goes with the right subject that and putting the where the adverb goes and uh you can tell i don't know too much about either ah i'm trying to try and i wanted to sound i wanted to sound like i knew what i was talking about i need sister joy i i could listen i could get my text out because she just sent me one recently i hope she don't mind uh she just sent me one recently and and i'll read one thing she said how about that yes we'd love to i'm not looking at her to see if she allows me to or not uh let me go back let me go back real quick real quick real quick real quick hallelujah i might not can find it oh i better don't read some of these i'm kidding you she didn't get nervous why did you i can't even find it i had sent her a quote hallelujah you know what it might not all be on here though yeah no mate is hallelujah praise the lord can't find it can you remember what you said about it was a quo it was this quote it was the quote the quote that i sent out friday and you said about how brother branham said he had it right in in the in the tents he over instead of oh yeah he said it was he and most of us would say it was him and when we read it it was he it sounds wrong but sister joyce was saying uh being the the grammar police that she is she was saying that was the right way to say it which just tickled me real good i know that's not a very manly word but it tickled me real good because i thought even in that little education that he had he was more correct in his english than i am mine people make fun of his grammar and mine is actually worse than his so you're probably making fun of me too so enough said and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy paragraph 77 jesus as soon as he received the fullness of the spirit on the river when john baptized him immediately the devil took him into the wilderness to go through a time of temptation but when he took the word of god and overcome the devil it is written it is written he came back out then ready for his ministry he was driven by the power of god in and out of the wilderness now let me share you with you the next one it's in a message show us the father and it suffices i like this one you you know this one i've shared it with you before jesus had all the fine qualities of god in him we could say all the attributes do you believe it he said he had powers upon powers but when he met satan he never used his power he gave an example for the weakest of christians have you ever felt powerless against the enemy jesus was showing you there is a way out of your situation even when you feel powerless even when you feel weak and without strength there is a way out of your problem out of your situation and that is by the word of god he said he gave an example for the weakest of christians when he met satan he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god though listen i know in this church of super christians there are no weak ones here but i'm going to say this so that if you ever get weak or feel weak you'll know that even my god whoa lord i don't want to get beside myself hallelujah the weakest christian can take that stand hold it sure god's in his word when you are powerless the word is powerful when you are weak the word is strong he said god always uses his word to defeat his enemy you and i must defeat our enemy the same way jesus defeated his enemy by the word you can't use what you don't know you can't use what you don't have you've got to get it in you you've got to get the word of god in you remember we've said since i was a child it's not how much of the word of god you go through it's how much of god's word goes through you it's what you receive and allow the holy spirit to anoint and then you use and utilize and take up the power and take up the authority take up the strength that's provided for us by the word the weakest christian can take that stand hold it sure god's in his word every time when he would meet the enemy he said it is written i want to hear you say it is written what if i don't have the power to serve the lord it is written what if my pain increases it is written what if the enemy tells me to harm myself it is written when you mention something as fatal and final as suicide people will marvel sometime they'll say oh my there's so many who take their lives i don't know what the statistics are but i have to give you the other side of the coin there are so many more that win the victory against that enemy that wants to take them out there are people sitting in this room right now that had to overcome that enemy years ago or they wouldn't be alive today to shout the praises of god so if they get a little loud or they wave their flag at you or they are they worship in a way that you don't worship just hold your peace and remember that you don't know like they know you don't know like they know what the lord has done for them you may not know the depth of their testimony but there are people in this room that took up the pistol there are people in this room that took up the bottle of pills because they wanted to end it all and you don't hear the glorious reports of what the power of god can do in a situation like that this prophet that i mentioned just a few moments ago god gave him a ministry and the enemy tried to take that ministry out because when he refused to obey the lord and go to the pentecostals because he was a baptist and his mother-in-law was a baptist and his mother-in-law didn't want her son-in-law dragging her daughter down there with those trash holy rollers you see i remember when the assemblies of god churches weren't big cathedrals on the hill i remember when the pentecostal churches were on the wrong side of the tracks and i'm not that old but i remember when they were on the wrong side of the track and when when you said pentecostal they looked down on you and this mother-in-law mrs brumback she didn't want her daughter to be drugged down into that pentecost so he just put off the invitations and didn't go and god had a way of getting his attention and god loves you just like he loved brother branham and he has a way of getting your attention and talking to somebody he has a way of getting your attention and he brought a flood to that whole ohio valley region the ohio river flooded its banks and i want you to know it took out many many many lives not just drowning but tuberculosis was running rampant at that time and that cold damp environment of the flooded whole area of jeffersonville in louisville kentucky all that area underwater that cold damp environment just fed that lung condition and brother branham lost his wife sister hope and lost his precious little baby girl sharon rose and it was more than he could take when he realized that it was his own disobedience that caused god's voice to be that loud in his life somebody in here saying right now i don't believe god would do something like that then you don't know the god of the bible i don't know what god you know but you don't know the god of the bible the god of the bible was jealous for the destiny of william branham the god of the bible is jealous for your destiny the god of the bible wants you to step into what god has called you for and he'll find you it's called sovereignty if you want to boil down the message that i believe here we go uh god is sovereign you are not god is sovereign i am not somebody said then we don't have any why would we even try because the greatest joy in all the world is to come into fellowship and cooperation with god's plan for your life you don't have to be casting out devils and raising the dead but when you know that you have surrendered your will to his will it's joy unspeakable and full of glory there's no greater feeling in all the world than to know when you lay your head on the pillow at night if something should happen to me and i don't wake up in the morning and they find me here i they would be no need for them to worry because i have no worry whatsoever i know exactly where i'm going you can't have that confidence if you still think you earn your salvation you can't have that kind of confidence because you'll never know that you're earning it enough you'll never know that you're paying a great enough price but when you come to the revelation that you're not earning anything you're coming into fellowship and cooperation with what jesus has done on your behalf and he gives you peace i give you peace in the world you're going to get tribulation he said but i give you peace because i have overcome the world every time when he would meet the enemy he said it is written i believe he had power to do it but he met satan on the same grounds with the same word that you can meet him with everyone it is written so you can't face the enemy in your power you may have a little you may not but you can meet the enemy any time every time all the time on the same grounds that jesus met the enemy on the word in you it is written is anybody here good i'll take a few more minutes then beginning to think you left in a message called how can i overcome paragraph 68 he said no matter how good how bad whatever you're in the kingdom by by holy ghost baptism see that's the only way you overcome it's all that is under the shed blood is overcomers how many of you are under the shed blood of jesus christ put your hand up if you are i didn't mean to yell i yell all the time but i didn't mean to yell at you i just wanted you to be sure you know what you're talking about if you're under the shed blood then you're overcomers because you cannot overcome yourself it's he that overcome for you here's the here's the grammatically correct quote it's he that overcome for you and what is that next little phrase there it didn't say you're testing it didn't say you're stressing didn't say you're striving what did it say [Music] ma i don't have to preach just let the quotes preach if that doesn't preach to you i'm worried about you you're not overcoming by your power you're overcoming the same way he overcome by the word because you're underneath the shed blood so it's he that overcome for you you're resting this don't feel like rest feels like a battle all the time you know why because the prophet told us the greatest battle ever fought would be on the battlefield of the mind if you overcome the pressure of your mind you'll overcome every obstacle in your life if you'll bring every thought into subjection to the word of god if you'll wrestle every one of those exalted thoughts down pull them down punch them beneath the truth of god's word you'll overcome every time you'll overcome every time you'll overcome every time hallelujah how can i overcome same message paragraph 72 go hear the message go hear the message it's a wonderful wonderful sermon how can anything preach in 1963 be any good for today just go here for yourself go here for yourself because it's more it's more relevant to this generation than the one it was delivered to you see i don't believe this message because there were miracles many people were convinced that there was a truth here because they saw the miracles in the gifts that that's not why we're following it now that's not why we're resting in this truth now we're resting in it because it sits right on top of god's word in that same message he said the thing you have to overcome [Music] is yourself you're the worst enemy you got you're the biggest critic you got your shame your embarrassment your condemnation your guilt your fear you've got to overcome you the enemy will convince you that everybody else is condemning you when you're the only one that's got your trigger turned toward you you got the barrel turned on you everybody else is letting god have his way in your life but the enemy sometimes we have to do that sometimes we just have to take our hands off and say oh god you take care of my brother you take care of my sister you know how to help him get beyond this but the enemy if he can keep you to where you'll keep the barrel turned on yourself he can rest the enemy can rest he doesn't have to labor as long as we're laboring for him the thing you have to overcome is yourself your idea your thing and surrender yourself to him he overcome for you say that with me he overcome for you he knows the way i wonder i don't want to miss that last phrase he knows the way he knows the way can you trust a god that doesn't always give you the way can you trust a god that doesn't always hand you the map and tell you what the next five years are going to look like can you trust a god who doesn't always give you the answer when you want it if you can't you're gonna be in trouble you've got to be willing to go and he says go even if you don't know the way you'll say well now that doesn't make any sense how can i go if i don't know the way i'll tell you how you just put one step spiritually in front of the other and you let god reveal and unfold his plan to you one step at a time our intellectual mind doesn't like it like that our intellectual mind likes for god to say now step one although none of us are disorganized some of you are putting salt in the cookies and and and and sugar on the fried chicken you got things you your your kitchen your your cupboards looks like a tornado you can't find what you have our problem is not necessarily organization is we don't have enough room and you have to dig to the back of the pantry to find a can of something you need it almost gets easier just to buy another can don't act like we're so all so organized that we've got it all planned out you know most of us when we have a vacation i know there are some who who uh there are some charities in the world there are some sally dukes in the world who plan out every step what they're going to do next and what they're going to see and pre-arrange and pre-book and pre-pay and then they head off on vacation and i think that'd be wonderful but if that was the only vacation you got to take that would not be the most relaxing one if you had all of it planned before you got there what about a down day and i think they they're good to schedule a downtime or a down day you you how do you know how do you know how you're going to feel on the middle day of your vacation how do you know that you're going to want to go parasailing i know right now i'm not going to want to go parasailing you we lack things planned out ahead of time but we don't always succeed and we treat our own life that way sometimes we want god to just unfold the scroll just unroll the scroll and you're gonna on such and such a day october of you're gonna hit this spot and you're gonna step into that and this is going to come and everything and we love that but i want you to know it doesn't take any kind of faith [Music] if the script is already in your hand oh it doesn't take any faith to live for jesus but i want you to know we trust him even though we don't know five minutes into the future unless god would anoint our eyes and let us see in the spirit we don't know what we'll be doing five minutes from now but god looks he sees eternity there's nothing about you that he doesn't know some of you said i wished i knew who i was going to marry god knows you wait and get married for the right reason you'll get the right mate better get off of that one it's the truth though and i owe that i owe that to my children to teach that i owe that to your children to preach that from this pulpit if you get anxious you will miss the mind of god you know even christian young people are too superficial sometimes they're looking for the shape of the nose when they need to be looking for the character because you can you can love a man with a big nose some of you men better be glad you can love somebody with big ears but you don't want to be cornered in the house with a brawling woman or a dominating man there's a way to lead a family but it's not by stepping all over them it's by being an example let me tell you something you don't want to get in that kind of a mess i don't know how many i've talked to through the years and i asked them have you asked this have you asked that have you asked this have you ever thought to ask them that and they look like i didn't know i was supposed to didn't know i was allowed to if you're getting ready to say i do you better be willing and ready and in the right environment with the right with the right care a right supervision you better be willing to ask anything and everything that comes to your mind and if somebody's not willing to give you the right answer you better be careful because the enemy has a trap the enemy has a trap if you're just willing to wait on god and trust him he'll bring the right one your way listen if if a young girl has to paint her face or she has to uh tighten up her skirt or she has to do something like that to catch some young man's eye he's no prize he may be a punk but he's not a prize if he can't love you for who you are then he doesn't love you i'll tell you what's wrong i'll tell you what's wrong with this age i'll tell you what's wrong pornography has destroyed a generation pornography you say i'm not i'm not believing you're going to yes i am i'm going to say something plain so you better put your seat belt on some of you are saying oh we got visitors here yes i know that we always will but the truth is the truth you feed your life on that filth you let that rule you it will rule you it will dominate your life you will tell yourself a thousand times i'm not gonna go there again and you will every time because if you conceal and hide your sin it will continue to have power over you the only way to get deliverance is to find accountability and to find it quick there's a generation of people out there a generation of young men and young women who have given themselves to the filth of this world through pornography and then they get married and they can't be satisfied because everyday life is not a performance anybody with me everyday life is not costumes and paraphernalia come on now what we need to see is giving god every part of who we are and allowing him to use his word to cleanse to deliver to uproot to put the ax to the root of the tree until everything that's in us that is not of him is dealt with so that we can get out from under the guilt and we cannot be afraid to testify people are afraid to testify what god has done because they're afraid he'll take it back he's not going to take it back you may surrender it but he's not going to take it back if god gives you relief you ought to praise him if god gives you a momentary moment of of getting help and feeling better in your body you ought to give him prayer well i'm scared to say anything cause it may come back let me tell you something this isn't witchcraft this is war i got to get back to the my little little little christianette message here you know how can i overcome same message paragraph 103 and we're nearly done it's 112 for any clockwatchers that are embarrassed to look jesus told us how to do it 103 is the paragraph how can i overcome jesus told us how to do it he overcome means overcome means to stand the test how many of you believe you can face the test and stand the test once you understand who jesus is in you he said that's right like all the old saints did like jesus did amidst all of his enemies he stood the test everything he was tested against he stood it in the very face of sickness and him being messiah he healed them in the face of death he brought it back to life in the face of calvary his own death he defeated it by surrendering himself he defeated death by surrendering himself to death because as he surrendered to death he made way for resurrection he said why by the word said you destroy this temple and i'll raise it up in three days the word said so come on see and in the presence of death he defeated it he overcame death overcome death in the presence of hell he defeated hell and overcome hell yes in the presence of the grave he overcome the grave why all by the word and humility and this humility is what tells you i can't do this in my own power in my own strength by my own wit by my own good looks by my own smarts i am nothing without him the only way i can overcome is to let him overcome in me he said oh my there's the real man there's the one to make your example see he defeated everything overcome it are you with me good i've got another one i want to share paragraph 104 or you're just reading to us now yes look temptation was for him you know that the bible said he was tempted i want you to hear me if you hadn't heard me yet he was tempted at all points like we are yet without sin he was tempted by drinking oh i love this quote it rattles the religious cage because we gloss over what the book says the bible said he was in every manner tempted as we are every manner all manner you know what i believe that means every and all i believe it means all i believe it means in any way that you and i can be tempted he was also tempted that's how he became the propitiation for our sins i love this because if you use the example i used a moment ago if anybody is tempted to cut themselves or harm themselves he was remember tempted to drink all you see the temptation is not the sin it's yielding it's not overcoming that's unbelief when you get delivered from a pentecostal mindset that tells you everything is sin [Music] and you come to understand that the only sin is unbelief and everything else we do we do as attributes of unbelief so if we could get the unbelief taken care of we could have deliverance over the drinking we could have deliverance over the caring what we could have delivered if we get the unbelief if we get the unbelief problem if we get the faith problem settled there's power to overcome by the word of god if we can get the unbelief problem set up i believe i believe i believe i believe you just tell it i believe i believe the way it's made i believe the way of escape is made he was tempted by drinking oh now i know why you got quiet you were reading ahead you don't want your jesus you don't want to think about your jesus as as being tempted by a lustful thought but he was that makes me want to run around this room and hoop and holler and jump and scream at the top of my lungs let's see how that would how the visitors would feel then whoa it makes me want to shout because it means that there's nothing that the enemy can use against me that jesus hasn't already won the victory for me granny do it granny knew it she'd say you can't keep the bird from flying over your head but you can keep him from building a nest in your hair [Applause] the thought can run right by you and you just wave at it and keep sending it on its way but if you click [Music] if you entertain it if you fellowship it at all why listen i've been told by people that when they get in that place that thoughts start coming in their mind against the church and they start yeah and they start these thoughts start running through and said well you know you're not the only one there's a bunch of hypocrites over there at the church anyhow and then they start blaming different ones this one won't speak to me and that one won't speak to me this won't do this and that one won't do that and i'm the target of everything and that's how people do that's not what you ought to be thinking when you're under the gun how wrong everybody around you is when you fall under the gun you better be thinking about how good jesus is and you better be thinking about i'm not going to let no hypocrite get between me and god i'm not going to let no preacher get between me and god i'm not going to let nobody that won't talk to me get between me and god i'm going to serve god anyway i'm going to get help now i'm going to wave goodbye at these thoughts i'm not going to give them a lodging place in my heart i'm not going to let the bird build a nest in my hair i'm going to send it on i'm going to answer it with it is written it is written it is written it is written i'm not a low down good-for-nothing sinner because a thought came to my mind jesus was tempted in all manner jesus was tempted in all manner jesus was tempted by drinking jesus was tempted by women whoo my my my my mom i just don't know why we have to read these quotes because i could never remember all of these things in churches that would be too proud to read them the preachers won't preach it anyway i grew up i was in the church six and seven times a week and i never heard anybody preach ever preach i heard holiness preached i preached it sinned heard it preached i heard them preach it was sin to drink coca-cola i heard them preach it with sin to drink coffee i heard them preach it with sin for a woman to wear a hat i heard them preach it was on and on and on and on and on and on they went but nobody ever preached to me when i was growing up that jesus was tempted in all manner as we are and yet he overcame if somebody could have just told me that i would have realized i'm not alone in this war my lord was tempted my lord was tempted and he overcame the musicians are coming he was a man and yet you couldn't put a mark on him you understand that don't you does anybody understand that he was not guilty of sin he didn't yield to the temptation he didn't entertain the temptation he sent it on its way but he had to go through that he had to experience that so that you and i could have confidence in his ability to help us get through the same and more he said overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks he said a lot of people say there's no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real and you must know he's the devil then the same time that you recognize him and know that he's the devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you have you invited him in i'm closing have you invited him in how do i know he's living in me have you invited him in have you asked him to forgive you of unbelief have you asked him to forgive you for wrestling with him for control of your life he wants to hold the reins not because he wants to run you in the ground but because he wants to give you power to overcome in life but the struggle of power and the struggle of who's in charge will sometimes cause you to leave god out of the equation but i implore you invite jesus into your life not some just some little concept of naming the name of christ but a real born-again experience let him wash you in his blood let him cleanse you by his word let him fill you with the life of god by the baptism of the holy ghost then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already overcome hymn praise his name let's finish this one and by his grace the old timers the old-timers used to tell us things like you very careful you ever be careful what you say you better be careful what you say let him that think they stand take heed less default yes i know the word i know it says that that's pride that's taking an arrogancy and thinking that you can defeat it on your own power that's what's wrong they'd say you better be careful how you say things like that you'll make the devil mad let me tell you something if you've never made him mad you need to wake up and take that saddle off your back cause he's he's riding you you ain't nothing but a horse in his in his corral he will ride you as long and as hard as he possibly can and for as long as he possibly can until you realize i don't have to be road i don't have to have him on my back all the time driving me to this and driving me to that and pushing me to this and pushing me to that by the grace of jesus christ you are more are you still here more than a match i heard it preach brother man when i was a boy you're no match for the devil you better be careful you're no match for the devil that's because the church has the concept like i said a moment ago that god made the enemy more strong than he you do know that he made that devil you do know that he made that devil don't you yes he did somebody said well he didn't he didn't make him to be evil he didn't make him to be wicked then where do you think it came from the prophet of god was very careful to tell us that satan is not a creator he does not have power to create he only has power to twist and pervert that which is already created [Music] so where does the bible tell us that evil comes from where does the bible tell us darkness comes from the bible said god created it for his purpose and somebody said well what in the world is that his purpose was to be a redeemer but he couldn't redeem that which was not lost this is a mastermind this is a god who is omnipotent and omniscient and omnipresent this is a god who knew from the beginning all the trials of our lives and he made a way of escape he made a salvation so secure and so real that we can enter into that and we can take it and let it be the theme of our life yeah you must recognize that god in you is greater than he is and that the one that's in you has already overcome him and by his grace you're more than a match for him amen there's real overcoming when you recognize he said you look back this is the last one for this morning i didn't get to job you look back and say i'm doing this and i'm doing that then you're defeated but there's no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit then you realize that you've overcome and you know that he's a devil and you can't say i got a sickness i don't believe in the sickness oh yes it is a sickness you've got cancer you don't believe it's a cancer it is a cancer it is a cancer but remember you see brother branham he wasn't name it and claim it and blab it and grab it he had a lot of correction for the charismatics and they couldn't handle it because remember the whole faith movement a lot of it was telling us you know you can't say this you can't say that you can't so so people get confused and when they died with the disease the rest of the church would say they lost the faith i've been around a long time i've been in church all my life i heard it they ward and ward and ward for healing and ward for healing and fought for healing and then when the saint of god would go they'd say well they must have lost the faith i told them then and i tell you now we're not snake handlers [Music] that's what they used to say about the snake handlers they'd handle them successfully until one day they got bit and died and they'd say they lost the faith brother branham was not about you being in denial he wasn't about you not not saying what it is what it has been so afraid now i try to be careful i try not to name mine because of what it does to me every cell in your body responds to the vibration and the frequency of your voice [Applause] amen so i want to be careful what i speak over the cells of my body but if you get in a tongue tied moment and you were to say it's cancer nobody's going to come back to me and tell me later if the lord takes you home that that's why because you said it the wrong way you lost the faith you didn't you you somehow didn't claim it just right remember what the prophet taught us when he was talking to sister statscliff she said the baby died brother branham and if i would have had more faith my baby wouldn't have died brother random said oh sister sats cliff that's not the case god saw your faith it was because of your faith that he was allowed he felt like he could then work according to his will and his plan because he knew that you would not curse him he knew that you had faith and you were not going to turn loose to that faith even in the moment of your great sorrow and in your sorrow he was working something out on your behalf somebody said i don't believe that i do and i believe it enough for both of us we're not fishing in here my granddaddy used to tell me you're not catching any fish not very often because i always caught more than he did he see he would see to that but he would say this to me he said you're not you must not be holding your mouth right and when i was real little i start and my big mom and say ralph quit saying that to that baby you quit telling him that honey you don't have to twist your mouth up like that you just have to be patient and there i was sitting trying to get my lip just right i kept looking at him to see how he was holding his this is how we are sometimes as christians we think i gotta hold my mouth just right or i'll miss my miracle [Music] let me tell you something that's not a sovereign god you're going to call it what it is sometime sometime you're going to call it what it is sometime even though you try not to you're going to name it i gotta go gotta go we gotta go my my my let me finish this though he said i uh you i got a sickness and i i don't believe it's a sickness and oh yes it's a sickness you got a cancer you don't believe it's a cancer it is a cancer it is a cancer but remember greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world why don't you tell the devil today i don't care what you call it i don't care what his name is greater is he that is in me that he that's in that demon hallelujah he said you must you must realize that the holy spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing be it cancer be it migraine headaches be a depression whatever it is you must realize that the holy spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing and he's in you and you can overcome read it by him that's exactly sensible it's exactly the way the scripture's written overcoming overcoming i stood there and listened to these young people

much and this is our opportunity that's been five years and i first time i've seen her in five years i hope it won't be five more years but i was wrestling up there i was wrestling up there and the

your faith toward them right now lord i lay my hands on this young man and this young lady because we love her we're going to love him it's not hard it's just the way it works in the kingdom and in the family of god when you care for somebody you just take who they care for into your life and we're taking him into our life lord whether we have opportunity to see him again or not i don't know these things are in your hands but i'm asking you lord to make yourself real to them oh god i'm asking you to reveal your love to them lord in a way they've never known it before i'm asking you to watch over their lives oh god there's not a one of us in this room that hasn't made mistakes before you made poor decisions use poor judgment and you never quit loving us you drew us in with arms of compassion that we could not understand and you showed us a mercy that was so amazing that to this day words fail us when we try to describe what grace has accomplished in each of our lives so today lord as a family we just lay hands on them and we join our faith with them and we pray that your perfect plan and your perfect will will be done in their life for your glory we will never accept that the enemy could just drive them any way he would choose we stand on the promise of god's word and we pray that they will make a full surrender to you and let you live in them and overcome for them on their behalf now i take authority over every work of darkness that might follow their and any assignment of of the enemy to bind them or hold them in any area where deliverance is needed we know today that deliverance comes from you lord and we ask you as they would invite you to come and let your blood cleanse and deliver and strengthen and surround them with your love whatever their future is they'll they'll never be able to get along and make a life without you because we've seen what happens when people try to do it without you so lord i'm asking that you will allow them the grace to do whatever they do with you and with your help and not standing alone oh god i just ask you that shame would be removed from their lives and that they would stand peaceful in your presence to surrender to whatever you have for them in the mighty name of jesus christ hallelujah i'm sorry if you got too embarrassed my pleasure let's thank the lord for touching them let's believe that god's perfect will will take a hold of their lives overcomers and this life oh we've been made [Music] through the blood [Music] pray one for another right now would you do that just lay your hands on one another

you are and hear this victory very few of the people who are standing in this room know the battle that i have been going through because i've tried very very hard to be quiet but this week has been one of the hardest weeks i've had in a long long long time and this morning i really wanted to come to church and it was a battle to get here and as i walked into the sanctuary it just felt something was going to be special about this service for me praise god praise god i've been battled in my faith i've been tested in ways i haven't been tested in a long long time and he came this morning hallelujah and while i was sitting in my pew i kept hearing brother ron spencer devil you lose yes yes yes you learned and before nathan came up front at the end of the service i felt like god wanted me to come and give him praise and as i was standing there i heard i heard the lord say devil you hey man god bless you hey man hallelujah thank you jesus praise the lord god bless you so you
