TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Hello everybody. We've just had a wonderful hike up in the springs of Angeti and we have made it all the way up to David's waterfall and uh it's so cool and so refreshing after having such a hot uh hike up in the hills. The kids are having a good time in the pools and we are remembering some of the exciting biblical things that took place in this area. We know for sure that David was hiding in one of the caves of Engeti when Saul was pursuing him. And uh I think the scripture records that he sent 3,000 men into these hills to find David, to confiscate David. Of course, we know how the story ended in the Bible, but David was God's man for the hour, but we just want to say hello to you and send you lots of love and greetings from Angetti, Israel. And uh thank you for helping us to get here. And uh we just are having a wonderful time. We're sensing the presence of the Lord wherever we go. and we don't even know all that God is doing in us. Um, but we just pray that as the coolness of the water refreshes us physically, that the cool water of life that flows from Yeshua will refresh us while we're here. And we're sending some of that refreshing toward you right now in the name of Yeshua, the Messiah, be refreshed from the springs of living water that literally flow here in the deserts of Israel. God bless you. Heat. Heat.
