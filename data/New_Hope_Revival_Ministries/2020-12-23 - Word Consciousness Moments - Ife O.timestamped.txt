[0:00] be it unto me according to thy word and
[0:03] in her womb a new order was born
[0:14] it's time for the new order to be born
[0:18] and that is exactly what he did in
[0:21] bethlehem
[0:23] that's exactly what he did in bethlehem
[0:26] of a little maiden girl who cried out
[0:30] in her in her thoughts of shame in her
[0:32] thoughts of embarrassment
[0:34] but her faith cried out for her be it
[0:37] unto me according to thy word
[0:39] and in her womb a new order
[0:42] was born something that had never been
[0:46] done before
[0:48] in the earth jesus had a blood
[0:51] that could be sprinkled on the
[0:53] conscience of the worshipper
[0:55] hallelujah and when that blood is
[0:57] sprinkled on the conscience
[0:59] of the worshipper he loses his
[1:03] sin consciousness so the guilt is gone
[1:08] so the condemnation is gone in fact the
[1:11] accusation
[1:12] is gone somebody said what happened to
[1:15] the accusation
[1:16] i'll tell you
[1:19] it got nailed to the cross
[1:22] every accusation against us
[1:26] nailed to the cross this is to bring us
[1:30] into a holy conscience a god
[1:34] conscience a word conscience instead of
[1:37] a sin
[1:38] conscience what we're saying is we get
[1:41] transformed out of a kingdom of darkness
[1:44] into a kingdom of light and therefore
[1:46] instead of always being
[1:48] aware of transgression we become
[1:51] more aware of forgiveness and redemption
[1:55] and the price being paid now why this is
[1:58] important is
[1:59] it changes the posture of our prayer
[2:02] because we're no longer coming as
[2:04] someone who has to beg
[2:08] for deliverance or for forgiveness
[2:11] but we come with a word conscience
[2:14] we come with a spirit conscience
[2:18] instead of a sin conscience so we see
[2:20] what the word says
[2:22] so if we know there's something that we
[2:23] need to make right the holy ghost is
[2:26] in us he can put his finger on it
[2:29] amen he can point it out
[2:32] does anybody still have the holy ghost
[2:35] does anybody still feel the pricking
[2:38] of the holy ghost and when you feel that
[2:41] conviction or that pricking of the holy
[2:44] ghost
[2:45] then you approach god but not as a
[2:47] beggar
[2:48] and not as a sinner
[2:51] [Music]
[2:52] but as a son if you know the truth if
[2:56] the truth has once set you free
[2:58] if you have accepted god's bleeding word
[3:01] on your behalf you don't have to beat
[3:04] your way back to the cross
[3:07] you don't have to prove yourself to the
[3:09] church to get back in fellowship with
[3:10] god
[3:11] all you have to do is wake up
[3:19] you
