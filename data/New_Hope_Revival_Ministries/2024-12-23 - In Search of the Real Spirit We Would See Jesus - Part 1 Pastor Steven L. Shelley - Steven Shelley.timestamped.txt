[56:56] Revelation there's Grace oh my what
[57:01] Revelation are we talking about that God
[57:03] sent a prophet no we're talking about
[57:07] the revelation of Jesus Christ who he is
[57:12] presently right now you don't have to
[57:16] wonder where He Is We Know by Revelation
[57:19] exactly where Jesus is right now he's
[57:22] not
[57:23] missing come on now we know EX exactly
[57:26] where he
[57:28] is do you know where he is he's right
[57:32] here he's not a million miles away he's
[57:37] right here the throne in the New
[57:40] Covenant is not a million miles away
[57:43] it's here the Ark of the Covenant in the
[57:46] New Covenant the Ark of the Covenant in
[57:49] the New Covenant is not a million miles
[57:51] away or are in
[57:54] Israel under the new Covenant the ark is
[57:57] here that's what the scripture said read
[58:00] Hebrews it's here he's moved in it was
[58:04] his desire to find a house to dwell in
[58:08] you may be seated just a moment I admire
[58:10] you for the strength the the the
[58:14] determination the dexterity that you
[58:16] show to stand and I know that some of
[58:19] you aren't able and we certainly would
[58:21] want you to take rest when you need it
[58:24] but I I I get to stream Services
[58:27] sometime when I'm doing there are
[58:29] particular things I can do and stream
[58:32] certain things you can't do I can't do
[58:34] accounting or bookkeeping
[58:38] streaming in fact sometimes Benjamin
[58:40] will come to ask me a question and I'll
[58:45] say Olivia was in my office this week
[58:48] doing some filing for me and uh she
[58:51] needed to ask me a question and I said I
[58:53] just give me a few minutes and when I
[58:55] got through I had the I had my laptop I
[58:59] had my phone I had two screens on the
[59:02] computer and I had about 15 pieces of
[59:05] sticky paper I had written on to solve
[59:08] one
[59:09] problem so I had to use digital and
[59:12] analog that's just the bur that's don't
[59:15] don't it's not that the problem was so
[59:18] complicated it's just not my forte but
[59:21] God is good but I have a chance to
[59:23] stream Services sometime and I'm just
[59:26] just always shocked at how folk can sing
[59:29] 20 minutes into a worship service all
[59:31] still
[59:33] seated I I I don't get it I just don't
[59:36] get it and if you're not able you're
[59:38] you're but I'm talking about young
[59:39] people kids my when I come into the
[59:42] presence of the
[59:44] Lord I don't want to I don't want to
[59:46] make it physical rest I I I want to give
[59:50] him everything I have you know brother
[59:54] brandom talks about how we honor the
[59:56] word he said if the Queen of England
[59:58] were to walk in you're not even a
[59:59] British citizen but if the Queen of
[1:00:01] England were to walk in you'd stand up
[1:00:03] you'd show her respect the office that
[1:00:05] she holds if the president were to walk
[1:00:08] in you might he might not be of your
[1:00:11] party but you'd stand up and I gave the
[1:00:13] example When Stacy and I were in
[1:00:15] Washington and and President Obama was
[1:00:18] going to speak he was not my favorite
[1:00:20] President by any means I don't like his
[1:00:23] politics never did and never will but he
[1:00:26] he was the president he was the will of
[1:00:28] the people so I stood up and showed him
[1:00:30] honor and respect because that's what we
[1:00:32] would do so how is it when the presence
[1:00:35] of the Lord starts building that that
[1:00:38] somebody wouldn't want to do something
[1:00:40] to welcome the king so I'm so thankful I
[1:00:44] started to say I'm proud of you but then
[1:00:46] someone would misunderstand that but I
[1:00:48] am very very Papa proud of you because
[1:00:52] you make every effort to give God praise
[1:00:56] to enter in and I want to thank you for
[1:00:59] that so much he's
[1:01:01] worthy he's worthy I don't seem to be
[1:01:04] hearing you I don't think my ears are
[1:01:06] stopped up but he's
[1:01:08] worthy he's worthy to be praised well I
[1:01:13] I I I won't sing we've had lots of good
[1:01:15] amazing anoint you know I just kept
[1:01:18] saying to myself the anointing when we
[1:01:20] heard these song I kept saying to myself
[1:01:23] the anointing is what makes the
[1:01:25] difference difference the anointing is
[1:01:28] what destroys the Yoke brother brandom
[1:01:31] talked about those trained singers who
[1:01:33] could hit the highest note and the
[1:01:35] lowest note and they knew how to pause
[1:01:37] and when to breathe and when to how long
[1:01:40] to hold out the note and how to make it
[1:01:42] a short note and he said but if there's
[1:01:44] no anointing there I'd nearly rather
[1:01:48] hear somebody that could barely carry a
[1:01:50] tune but get under that anointing
[1:01:54] because it's that anointing that makes
[1:01:56] it Minister life to us I said it's the
[1:02:01] anointing and the anointing is not an
[1:02:04] etherial or ethereal mist or some
[1:02:08] mystical uh something in the room the
[1:02:10] anointing is a
[1:02:12] person that's what Messiah means when
[1:02:16] when you hear Brother RJ pray in the
[1:02:19] name of Yeshua the Messiah he's
[1:02:21] identifying Jesus by his Hebrew name and
[1:02:25] he's saying he is the Messiah the
[1:02:27] Messiah he is the anointed one and
[1:02:32] that's that's so appropriate uh for what
[1:02:34] I'm going to preach today before I
[1:02:37] forget we have to say uh that we are so
[1:02:41] glad to see Jesse in service with us
[1:02:45] this morning and
[1:02:47] [Applause]
[1:02:54] we and we won't Roa to keep her mind on
[1:02:57] the Lord

[1:03:01] Jesse keep your mind on the Lord he's
[1:03:05] going to give you a word today but it's

[1:04:10] bless him in that and we we're thankful
[1:04:13] we're glad to see you in the house of
[1:04:15] the Lord I never know when the hollow
[1:04:17] Wells are coming anymore but I'm always
[1:04:19] happy somebody came in the room and said
[1:04:22] are the hollow Welles here I said I
[1:04:24] don't know he said well it looks like

[1:04:30] that you're

[1:04:38] here I want to give the musicians a
[1:04:41] thank you for what they've done in the
[1:04:43] leading of the
[1:04:48] worship he's just good isn't
[1:04:50] he uh so December
[1:04:53] 23rd uh which is tomorrow tomorrow
[1:04:56] today's the 22nd isn't it is brother
[1:04:59] RJ's birthday we were just talking about
[1:05:01] him in his prayer and uh his birthday is
[1:05:05] tomorrow and so we want to say happy
[1:05:07] birthday to him I appreciate
[1:05:13] him when we were doing the conferences
[1:05:15] and speaking in so many places around
[1:05:18] the world I used to hear them say many
[1:05:21] of the different speakers would say
[1:05:24] especially PK would say if you if you
[1:05:27] hear something that makes your inner
[1:05:30] Spirit leap or tremble or respond it's
[1:05:35] because that's a part of your destiny
[1:05:38] it's a part of your
[1:05:39] Revelation and when when RJ's leading us
[1:05:43] to the Lord uh most what I can say is
[1:05:47] amen so be it yes Lord because my heart
[1:05:51] so responds my inner spirit so responds
[1:05:55] to the truth that he is speaking when
[1:05:58] he's leading us to the lamb it it it's
[1:06:01] just a wonderful thing to know it's a
[1:06:03] wonderful thing to be reminded of the
[1:06:06] goodness of God and tomorrow is also
[1:06:09] Matthew's birthday sister Rebecca and we
[1:06:12] want to pray for him and send him a
[1:06:14] happy birthday will you please tell him
[1:06:16] that we all said happy birthday and
[1:06:18] we're praying for him he's got big
[1:06:20] decisions to make in his life uh that's
[1:06:23] the problem when you're a genius you you
[1:06:26] you got more more more uh uh problems
[1:06:29] sometimes and more uh difficult
[1:06:31] decisions to make but we pray that he
[1:06:33] will make the best decision because at
[1:06:36] the end of this race you can be highly
[1:06:39] intelligent and
[1:06:42] lost at the end of this race you can
[1:06:44] have the greatest education that money
[1:06:47] can buy and be
[1:06:49] lost I was sitting in my office today
[1:06:52] and I said one of these
[1:06:53] days those doors are going to to be
[1:06:55] locked somebody's going to come they're
[1:06:57] going to show up here perhaps some of
[1:06:59] you are going to show up here on a
[1:07:02] Sunday morning and you're going to find
[1:07:04] out the doors aren't even
[1:07:06] open maybe just a two or three four five
[1:07:09] six people I don't know how many I hope
[1:07:11] they're none but I have a feeling that's
[1:07:14] very likely that there'll be somebody
[1:07:16] out there waiting
[1:07:18] wondering what has
[1:07:21] happened and the reality will eventually
[1:07:24] strike the Rapture has
[1:07:29] happened the
[1:07:30] Overcomers are
[1:07:33] gone somebody said well what would we do
[1:07:35] then well here's the thing always to
[1:07:40] remember if you can't live for the Lord
[1:07:43] now with the Holy Ghost in This World
[1:07:48] what makes you think you would be able
[1:07:50] to live for him when he leaves here with
[1:07:52] the bride
[1:07:56] honestly any strength you have any faith
[1:07:58] you have is because the Holy Ghost is in
[1:08:01] the world brother brandham called him
[1:08:04] the
[1:08:05] restrainer and the scripture said when
[1:08:08] he that now lth will let until he be
[1:08:10] taken out of the way and the prophet
[1:08:12] tells us that when the bride leaves the
[1:08:15] Holy Ghost is going with her and he said
[1:08:18] if you think it's bad now wait until
[1:08:21] then it will be total insanity
[1:08:25] can you imagine you get the little Holy
[1:08:27] Ghost Bride out of here and there's
[1:08:29] nothing left to hold back the
[1:08:31] darkness somebody said what about the
[1:08:33] Christians who are not not Overcomers
[1:08:36] the problem with that is the spirit
[1:08:39] leaves how will they do it how will you
[1:08:41] do it I would imagine that in that day
[1:08:46] the things that matter to you so much
[1:08:48] today won't matter at
[1:08:53] all I I've got a feeling that a woman's
[1:08:55] high heel shoes or earbobs or whatever
[1:08:58] else she wants to hold on to I've got a
[1:09:01] feeling that that won't
[1:09:03] matter in that day there is no price too
[1:09:08] great to pay as an offering of
[1:09:11] Thanksgiving to the Lord for calling us
[1:09:14] out of this old world you can say Amen
[1:09:17] or oh
[1:09:18] me there's no Christmas
[1:09:21] Bobble that's going to mean more to you
[1:09:25] and shouldn't mean more to you today
[1:09:27] than your exit out of here now if there
[1:09:30] wasn't enough uh oxygen sucked out of
[1:09:33] the room already we just took the rest
[1:09:36] out so I might encourage you to take a
[1:09:38] deep breath and suck it all back in
[1:09:41] Jesus wants to talk to us today would
[1:09:43] you
[1:09:44] stand while you're standing we just say
[1:09:47] to every

[1:10:32] you brother and and I just can't even
[1:10:34] take the time it goes on down God bless
[1:10:37] you and everyone asking for prayer and
[1:10:39] we will certainly pray for the streamers
[1:10:41] they mean something to us today
[1:10:45] amen John chap 12 beginning in verse
[1:10:50] 20 and we have a few verses here before
[1:10:55] before we get to the red letters but
[1:10:57] long about verse 23 we start going to
[1:11:01] Red Letters you don't get to see that on
[1:11:03] the screen but those are the words of
[1:11:06] Our Lord the Bible tells us that all
[1:11:10] scripture is inspired and that it is
[1:11:13] profitable for for both reproof and
[1:11:15] Doctrine and so we love all the the
[1:11:18] letters no matter what color they are
[1:11:21] but we should pay very close attention
[1:11:25] uh to the red letters and I actually
[1:11:29] have a Bible it's too big to carry
[1:11:31] around but I actually have a Bible back
[1:11:34] there that has all the words of God both
[1:11:37] Old Testament and New Testament in red
[1:11:39] and it it really makes a difference
[1:11:42] sometime you're looking down at a page
[1:11:44] and you say my god did a whole lot of
[1:11:46] talking and not just through the
[1:11:48] prophets but he spoke in fact in John
[1:11:52] chapter 12 he spoke Right Out of Heaven
[1:11:55] and some said it thundered some weren't
[1:11:58] sure what was going on but it was God
[1:12:01] speaking to God God was speaking to the
[1:12:05] physical fleshly expression of himself
[1:12:08] the son in the earth now in chapter 20
[1:12:12] my let me just wipe my eyes one more
[1:12:14] time they're a little bit
[1:12:16] uh Misty I guess from the tears there
[1:12:21] were certain Greeks among them that came
[1:12:25] up to worship at the feast now these
[1:12:30] were
[1:12:31] Gentiles they were perhaps prelit to the
[1:12:35] Jewish faith the god of the Bible or
[1:12:38] they would not have come to worship at
[1:12:41] the feast but they were certainly
[1:12:43] Gentiles who had come to Jerusalem to
[1:12:48] worship at Passover and perhaps even uh
[1:12:52] for for Pentecost verse 2 1 the same
[1:12:57] came therefore to Phillip which was of
[1:13:00] Betha of Galilee and desired him saying
[1:13:06] sir we would see
[1:13:09] Jesus I I want you to think on
[1:13:13] that sir we would see Jesus Phillip
[1:13:18] cometh and tth Andrew and again Andrew
[1:13:21] and Phillip tell Jesus and Jesus
[1:13:25] answered them saying red letter the hour
[1:13:30] is
[1:13:31] come but that the son of man should be
[1:13:37] glorified verily verily I say unto you
[1:13:41] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[1:13:43] ground and die it abideth alone but if
[1:13:48] it die it bringeth forth read it much
[1:13:53] fruit he that loveth his life shall lose
[1:13:59] it all those things that matter you're
[1:14:02] going to lose him anyway one day and he
[1:14:05] that hateth his life in this world shall
[1:14:09] keep it unto life eternal If any man
[1:14:14] serve me let him follow me hear it and
[1:14:20] where I am there shall also my ser vant
[1:14:26] be if any man serve me him will my
[1:14:31] father honor would you permit me to read
[1:14:34] verse 26 again if any man serve me who
[1:14:38] is the me here Jesus is talking let him
[1:14:43] follow me who's the
[1:14:48] anyman
[1:14:50] me I I might as well because he was
[1:14:54] speaking to to disciples and those who
[1:14:57] were gathered there that day but if all
[1:14:59] scripture is for us and profitable for
[1:15:02] Doctrine and reprove then I can clearly
[1:15:05] say without taking this out of context
[1:15:08] if if Stephen Shelly serves me let
[1:15:12] Stephen Shelly follow me that's
[1:15:15] right let him be an imitator did you
[1:15:18] read frid's
[1:15:20] text and if you did like most people and
[1:15:22] only read the first few paragraphs
[1:15:25] you didn't get the kicker at the end I
[1:15:28] hope you read it all the way through
[1:15:32] because to follow him means to be an
[1:15:35] imitator of Christ that means walk like
[1:15:39] he walked and talk like he talk live
[1:15:42] like he lived and worship like he
[1:15:44] worshiped follow him if any man serve me
[1:15:48] let him follow me and where I
[1:15:50] am there shall also my servant be If any
[1:15:55] man serve me him will my father honor if
[1:16:00] you believe that would you say Amen Lord
[1:16:04] Jesus we are here today without a
[1:16:08] Personal Agenda we are here to discover
[1:16:12] your agenda for us we are uh many
[1:16:18] gathered here and many more gathered
[1:16:22] around the world connected to us
[1:16:25] uh via the stream and we give thanks for
[1:16:28] the technology and we give thanks for
[1:16:31] the desire in people's hearts to be
[1:16:34] connected to this house we pray today
[1:16:37] that you will hide your servant behind
[1:16:41] the cross and that you would speak
[1:16:45] through my lips as I would surrender my
[1:16:49] thoughts and my tongue to you I pray
[1:16:53] that you would open heart
[1:16:56] with your presence Let Your Grace be so
[1:16:59] known that it compels each one of us to
[1:17:04] open up our heart and let the word
[1:17:07] in if I speak something out of the word
[1:17:10] we pray that the Holy Spirit would bring
[1:17:13] correction before we leave this house
[1:17:16] and we will give you glory and honor and
[1:17:18] praise for all that you mean to us for
[1:17:22] your wonderful words of life we bless
[1:17:25] your Holy Name we ask for your help
[1:17:27] again in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:17:30] Christ Yeshua our Messiah and the church
[1:17:33] said amen you may be
[1:17:39] seated many many
[1:17:43] times in the message what we call the
[1:17:48] message the recorded sermons of brother
[1:17:51] brandham he used this text many
[1:17:55] times he may have called it a few
[1:17:59] different
[1:18:00] things and then there were many times
[1:18:03] that he was preaching on something else
[1:18:06] and he would mention the
[1:18:08] Greeks and he would mention the phrase
[1:18:12] in verse 21
[1:18:14] sir you almost always put an S on it
[1:18:18] s we would
[1:18:21] see Jesus
[1:18:24] I don't know why you came here
[1:18:26] today I don't know if you came out of a
[1:18:30] sense of
[1:18:32] obligation if you were afraid of being
[1:18:34] talked about or preached at or you're
[1:18:38] here because you think it's the right
[1:18:40] thing to do perhaps some of you came
[1:18:43] because you wanted to be here and
[1:18:45] there's nowhere else in the world you'd
[1:18:46] rather be maybe You Came To Worship
[1:18:49] maybe you came to hear a good song Maybe
[1:18:53] you came to hear the word hoping that
[1:18:56] you could Wade through all the rabbit
[1:18:59] trails and find something in the
[1:19:01] pastor's sermon that would apply to your
[1:19:04] life I I don't know why you came but I'm
[1:19:08] preaching today about a group of
[1:19:10] Gentiles I would say that in the natural
[1:19:13] most of us here are that and these were
[1:19:17] not ordinary Gentiles they were Greeks
[1:19:20] and if you know anything about the
[1:19:22] Greeks you understand that they thrive D
[1:19:25] not in um what we might say truth but in
[1:19:31] knowledge you know there's a difference
[1:19:34] you can be an educated
[1:19:36] fool uh you can know a whole lot and not
[1:19:40] know much about what really matters and
[1:19:43] some of the Greeks were like that they
[1:19:47] they were uh they wanted to to pull away
[1:19:51] from the the culture of the past
[1:19:55] as they wanted to bring their mythology
[1:19:59] with them their
[1:20:02] gods though they were intelligent they
[1:20:05] wanted to bring their gods with them
[1:20:06] into a new culture into a new
[1:20:09] Society they wanted to divorce
[1:20:12] themselves from most anything that
[1:20:15] looked like
[1:20:17] Judaism although they recognized that it
[1:20:21] was God's idea and they honored and
[1:20:24] recognized
[1:20:25] that we will say today for the sake of
[1:20:28] understanding Jehovah we know he was
[1:20:30] never called Jehovah in the Old
[1:20:32] Testament not in the New Testament it it
[1:20:35] it there's no J in the Hebrew language
[1:20:38] so some people like to say Yahweh or yve
[1:20:41] or some people just like to boil it down
[1:20:43] and say God but we know for sure that
[1:20:47] the Greeks accepted the god of the Jews
[1:20:50] as one of the gods they didn't dispute
[1:20:54] that he was real they just disputed that
[1:20:57] he was any more important than any of
[1:21:00] the other gods there's a problem there
[1:21:03] can anybody see the problem and so
[1:21:06] because they wanted to uh henize that's
[1:21:10] the word we use for for taking the truth
[1:21:13] of the god of the Bible and making it
[1:21:16] more culturally acceptable and and
[1:21:19] particularly when we're talking about
[1:21:21] the Greeks we we say the heniz of the
[1:21:26] faith meaning the greying anybody can
[1:21:30] understand that the greying of the faith
[1:21:33] uh uh mind you one of the first things
[1:21:35] they did was to make sure that uh anyone
[1:21:39] who was under the influence of the
[1:21:41] Greeks would would separate themselves
[1:21:45] from any of the Traditions or even laws
[1:21:49] of the Jews and they knew that it was uh
[1:21:53] even SP spoken of in the scripture uh
[1:21:57] for instance a man having a beard follow
[1:22:00] me are you with
[1:22:02] me a man having a beard and they they
[1:22:06] thought well we'll just make as many
[1:22:08] steps away from the the faith of the
[1:22:11] Jews as possible and one of the first
[1:22:13] things they did is they said we think
[1:22:15] that a Greek citizen should be clean
[1:22:18] shaven so that was not a Christianity
[1:22:21] idea that was a Greek influence
[1:22:25] and it's quite it was quite unnatural
[1:22:28] then it's quite unnatural now it can be
[1:22:32] painful actually you're using uh in in
[1:22:36] those days first sharp rocks and later
[1:22:40] metal blades and scraping it ac across
[1:22:43] tender skin and there may be reasons for
[1:22:47] doing it today because you you work on a
[1:22:50] job that requires it or you're in a
[1:22:52] situation that requires it somebody said
[1:22:55] my wife just doesn't like it I'm not
[1:22:57] making a
[1:22:58] Doctrine I don't think a man has to have
[1:23:01] a beard don't misunderstand me but he
[1:23:06] might but I can say that it's of a Greek
[1:23:10] idea that he
[1:23:11] shouldn't it's a Greek mentality it's
[1:23:14] not a Bible mentality it's a Greek
[1:23:17] mentality and you know we had the the
[1:23:20] Olympics and that's a Greek idea if it's
[1:23:24] a glorified
[1:23:27] emulation it's
[1:23:29] competition that gives birth to
[1:23:34] strife and many champions never make it
[1:23:37] all the way not because they're not good
[1:23:39] enough but because they're not political
[1:23:43] enough you know we just had some years
[1:23:46] ago in the in our nation this Scandal of
[1:23:49] a uh actress and her wealthy husband uh
[1:23:54] going to to jail because they
[1:23:57] paid to get their kid into an
[1:24:04] affluencer money almost bribery money
[1:24:08] hush money you pay me a certain amount I
[1:24:10] can get them in they felt like they
[1:24:13] deserve better and that happens in
[1:24:17] competition on a high school level a
[1:24:20] college level professional level and on
[1:24:22] an Olympic level so the a real Champion
[1:24:25] may never make it there because they
[1:24:28] didn't have the same privilege or
[1:24:30] connection so the whole concept now also
[1:24:33] remember that the Greeks were not for uh
[1:24:38] gender
[1:24:40] separation they really believe that uh
[1:24:43] everyone both man and woman should wear
[1:24:46] the same toga and it should look the
[1:24:49] same the Jews both wearing robes but
[1:24:51] very different robes with different
[1:24:55] styling different color uh different
[1:24:58] belting so there was a clear distinction
[1:25:02] among the Jews though they both wear
[1:25:03] robe wore robes we understand that in
[1:25:06] second temple period men were already
[1:25:09] wearing breaches underneath their
[1:25:12] robe and they got that from the from the
[1:25:15] priest who had been doing it since the
[1:25:17] time of
[1:25:18] Moses uh but the Greeks especially the
[1:25:22] Greek men they like to to go commando
[1:25:26] with no undergarment on and they like to
[1:25:28] wear a toga and this this you know white
[1:25:32] almost see-through robe and the women
[1:25:35] would do the same and and everyone sort
[1:25:37] of began to look alike and women started
[1:25:40] cutting their hair and making it kind of
[1:25:43] a bold look and men doing the same
[1:25:47] shaving their face what they were doing
[1:25:50] was they were bringing people closer to
[1:25:54] the the idea that it doesn't really
[1:25:56] matter male or female now we know what
[1:25:59] God said about
[1:26:00] that are you with me I had got to the
[1:26:04] message yet for instance Deuteronomy 22
[1:26:07] says that everybody ought to know
[1:26:11] this it is an
[1:26:14] Abomination that word Abomination is
[1:26:17] something God hates fact Abomination is
[1:26:20] the strongest degree of abhorring or
[1:26:24] hating so if if you read something the
[1:26:27] Bible says it's an Abomination it means
[1:26:29] God hates it it doesn't mean that it's
[1:26:31] not his
[1:26:32] preference he would rather it be a
[1:26:35] certain way I'm going to depend on
[1:26:37] somebody to get in here
[1:26:39] now or it means he hates
[1:26:43] it and there are many things he hates he
[1:26:45] hates a prideful look he hates a lying
[1:26:50] tongue he says it it's an Abomination a
[1:26:52] lying tongue is an abomination ation
[1:26:54] before me a prideful look he said one
[1:26:58] that SS
[1:27:00] Discord among the
[1:27:02] Brethren
[1:27:04] gossipy throwing one another under the
[1:27:07] bus that's an Abomination unto God
[1:27:10] something that God hates but in
[1:27:11] Deuteronomy 22 and5 he said that it is
[1:27:14] an Abomination for a man to wear that
[1:27:17] which pertaineth to a woman a woman to
[1:27:20] wear that which pertaineth to a man uh
[1:27:24] let me read it someone get that for me
[1:27:26] I'm I'm going to get it backwards if I
[1:27:28] if I don't look at it say it again woman
[1:27:34] first which I thought so but let me just
[1:27:36] pull it up here just a minute uh because
[1:27:38] I want to want to lay the the woman
[1:27:42] shall not wear that which pertaineth
[1:27:44] unto a man neither shall a man put on a
[1:27:47] woman's garment for all that do so
[1:27:52] are hated
[1:27:56] it's not that God's hating the person
[1:27:58] it's the fact that God is hating that
[1:28:01] there is no
[1:28:03] differentiation between male and
[1:28:05] female the women shaving their head you
[1:28:09] know cropping their hair to look like
[1:28:13] men and the men uh doing the
[1:28:17] bangs and and the and
[1:28:20] the you know man bun today
[1:28:25] but I meant just the curly fuzzy because
[1:28:27] they need a good
[1:28:29] haircut that is not just a
[1:28:34] preference I want to tell you that it is
[1:28:36] a
[1:28:38] spirit and the Baptist wouldn't preach
[1:28:41] against it anymore the methodists
[1:28:43] wouldn't preach against it anymore
[1:28:45] Assemblies of God wouldn't preach
[1:28:47] against it anymore Church of God
[1:28:49] wouldn't preach against it even Emanuel
[1:28:51] Holiness wouldn't preach against it
[1:28:53] anymore and so now it is widely
[1:28:57] accepted for women to wear
[1:29:00] pants and it is becoming accepted for
[1:29:05] men to
[1:29:07] wear skirts I guess you'd
[1:29:09] say you don't want to go to a big city
[1:29:13] because you'll see all kinds of things
[1:29:16] men with more Gucci bags than their
[1:29:19] wives you know just odd this world is an
[1:29:23] odd place face the blending of gender is
[1:29:28] wrong God is not pleased with
[1:29:31] that and you you need to know that
[1:29:34] you're you're born male or female not
[1:29:37] not both in the eyes of God or either
[1:29:41] according to your choice in the folks
[1:29:45] don't you know that's a spirit don't you
[1:29:48] know that's demonic don't you know
[1:29:51] that's hatched out of hell it's the same
[1:29:54] demon that inspires a woman to put
[1:29:58] tarantulas on her
[1:30:03] eyes I I saw a stood in ly behind a
[1:30:07] young beautiful I guess she was
[1:30:08] beautiful I don't really know underneath
[1:30:12] all that
[1:30:14] crud and these eyelashes look like my
[1:30:20] hairbrush not
[1:30:22] natural not attract
[1:30:25] active you don't have to help me I'm
[1:30:28] going on 50 years of preaching like this
[1:30:32] and the world just eats it
[1:30:34] up I see
[1:30:39] message
[1:30:40] folks with somebody else's eyelashes
[1:30:44] on there's it's a
[1:30:47] spirit it's not natural The World Is
[1:30:51] Gone to muck and God God have mercy on
[1:30:55] anybody that decides to have a
[1:30:59] backbone and say that's not right it's
[1:31:03] not right God have mercy on somebody
[1:31:06] that says you can come for the holiday
[1:31:08] but your same seex
[1:31:12] lover is going to have to find somewhere
[1:31:14] else to sleep you're not going to sleep
[1:31:17] together in my
[1:31:19] home God have mercy if you find somebody
[1:31:22] with enough backbone to say you're not
[1:31:24] married to
[1:31:25] her so you're not going to sleep in my
[1:31:28] house in the same bed because you're not
[1:31:31] married to her I don't care whether you
[1:31:33] think I'm a fogy or whether you think I
[1:31:36] don't love my
[1:31:38] family God help
[1:31:41] us to have a real saw log for a
[1:31:45] backbone and say I don't have to do it
[1:31:47] in a hateful
[1:31:49] way I I don't have to do it in a
[1:31:52] humiliating way
[1:31:54] I can do it in a gentle way a private
[1:31:57] way a quiet way just know when you come
[1:32:00] that's
[1:32:05] right one's on the sofa if it has to be
[1:32:08] that way I think it's better they're
[1:32:09] somewhere else put them in a barn put
[1:32:11] them in the tent do whatever you have to
[1:32:13] do but if you let them sleep in the same
[1:32:15] house you're on the couch and I'm
[1:32:18] telling you if that door opens in the
[1:32:21] night you're not getting any pumpkin pie
[1:32:23] tomorrow
[1:32:25] cuz this how as for
[1:32:29] me as for me and my house we're going to
[1:32:33] serve the Lord
[1:32:35] here we love you we want you to be here
[1:32:38] we want to have fun with
[1:32:40] you but right is right wo and wrong is
[1:32:45] wrong so these Greeks knew everything
[1:32:48] about being
[1:32:50] wrong homosexuality was wild
[1:32:54] under this
[1:32:55] Greek
[1:32:59] era most wealthy
[1:33:02] men men of any
[1:33:05] affluence hired
[1:33:09] boys to be at their beckon call Young
[1:33:15] unmarried clean
[1:33:17] shaven
[1:33:20] men that Greek spirit is out of hell
[1:33:26] when the Greeks were in charge the
[1:33:29] Jewish faith had to be quiet the Romans
[1:33:34] followed suit when the Romans occupied
[1:33:37] the land the Jews could not keep Sabbath
[1:33:41] they couldn't uh celebrate the Feast of
[1:33:44] the Lord they had to do everything and
[1:33:47] secret fearing their life fearing for
[1:33:51] their life simply because another
[1:33:55] culture had come to rule the day to rule
[1:33:57] the land come on now there's another
[1:34:00] culture that's trying to rule America
[1:34:03] there's another culture that's trying to
[1:34:05] rule our nation in these last days
[1:34:09] somebody's got to make a
[1:34:12] stand now these Gentiles these Greeks
[1:34:16] were probably prelit to the Jewish
[1:34:20] religion and when the scripture said
[1:34:23] they came
[1:34:24] to worship at the feast it means to
[1:34:28] prostrate themselves before the god of
[1:34:31] Israel I want to honor that I want to
[1:34:34] say that in every culture and in every
[1:34:37] backslid generation there has always
[1:34:40] been and there will always be somebody
[1:34:44] some remnant some little group of people
[1:34:48] who will say I don't care if it's legal
[1:34:51] in the law of the land if God word said
[1:34:54] it is an Abomination it's
[1:34:57] illegal in my heart in my life in my
[1:35:02] family just a minute Amen brother preach
[1:35:06] I believe I will somebody should God
[1:35:10] bless these
[1:35:14] Greeks they had
[1:35:16] heard that Jesus had raised the
[1:35:21] dead there wasn't any Greek in the
[1:35:26] library that they had studied with that
[1:35:29] had raised the
[1:35:31] dead they got pretty interested in this
[1:35:35] now if they were
[1:35:38] Gentiles that had not made a conversion
[1:35:41] to the faith of the Jewish
[1:35:43] people they would have only been allowed
[1:35:46] to Worship in the outer
[1:35:48] court but had they made full conversion
[1:35:51] and been circumcised
[1:35:54] then they would have been allowed to
[1:35:55] come as a proelite as a converted one
[1:35:59] into the faith of the Bible we say Jew
[1:36:01] but it there were no
[1:36:03] Jews it was the Hebrews it was the god
[1:36:05] of the Bible the god of the Hebrews
[1:36:09] amen and then they would be allowed and
[1:36:11] fully fully accepted in we don't know
[1:36:14] the real story behind these men but we
[1:36:19] find them interesting I find them
[1:36:21] interesting they just walk up to Philip
[1:36:23] and they say sir we would see
[1:36:27] Jesus did you know the Bible never even
[1:36:30] tells us whether or not he met with
[1:36:35] them we don't even know if he was with
[1:36:38] them in their approach Jesus may have
[1:36:41] not even been there we just know they
[1:36:43] went and told Jesus what they said and
[1:36:46] Jesus never addressed their question
[1:36:50] their their desire for an interview he
[1:36:53] BAS basically saw it as a sign that when
[1:36:57] the Gentiles began to seek for the
[1:37:01] Messiah my time is coming to an
[1:37:05] end and basically if you read on you
[1:37:09] will find out in beginning in verse 24
[1:37:12] he says I
[1:37:14] die he just says verily I say un you
[1:37:17] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[1:37:19] ground and do die it abideth alone but
[1:37:22] if it die it it bringeth forth much
[1:37:24] fruit I die he's telling them there's
[1:37:26] something about these Greeks coming and
[1:37:30] asking after me that lets me know that
[1:37:33] this is the
[1:37:34] time and if they will lose their
[1:37:38] life they'll find something and you will
[1:37:40] too but if they love
[1:37:43] it you know if they if they serve me if
[1:37:47] any man serve me let him follow me if
[1:37:50] these Greeks want an interview let him
[1:37:52] go where I go let them live like I live
[1:37:54] let them worship like I worship and
[1:37:57] everything will be all right I'm about
[1:37:59] to leave here that's powerful to me sir
[1:38:03] we would see
[1:38:05] Jesus brother brandom tells us stay with
[1:38:07] me I I hope you can handle
[1:38:10] this uh because I'm on page one Mo sir
[1:38:14] we would see Jesus the message from 54
[1:38:17] the soul Cry of these Greeks the Greeks
[1:38:22] seek wisdom and the
[1:38:24] Jews seek signs and Paul said we preach
[1:38:29] Christ
[1:38:30] crucified we're not preaching the wisdom
[1:38:33] of man we're not preaching for
[1:38:36] signs he said we're preaching Christ
[1:38:40] crucified and the Greeks has always
[1:38:42] wanted
[1:38:44] wisdom now brother brandom uses the word
[1:38:46] wisdom there it was really a higher form
[1:38:48] of knowledge that the Greeks were after
[1:38:52] the Bible tells us if any man lack
[1:38:54] wisdom what do they do they ask God and
[1:38:56] he gives it nothing wrong with wisdom
[1:38:59] but don't think because somebody's got
[1:39:00] gray hair they've got wisdom don't think
[1:39:03] because somebody's lived on the earth 50
[1:39:05] plus years they've got wisdom I know
[1:39:08] some pretty unwise
[1:39:11] adults just a minute Amen brother I'm
[1:39:16] not saying you're one of them I'm just
[1:39:18] saying they
[1:39:20] exist and so but these Greeks come up
[1:39:23] perhaps were prelit to the Jew Jewish
[1:39:26] religion and came up to Jerusalem to
[1:39:29] worship at the Pentecostal Feast he goes
[1:39:33] on and then while they were up there
[1:39:36] they had heard of the great Fame of this
[1:39:37] one Jesus of Nazareth his Fame had
[1:39:40] scattered everywhere many disbelieved
[1:39:43] him thousands disbelieved him but
[1:39:45] thousands believed him isn't that great
[1:39:49] to hear and it was mostly among the
[1:39:51] common people
[1:39:54] not many
[1:39:56] Greeks not many
[1:39:58] affluent mostly the Common People
[1:40:00] brother Austin as you pointed out
[1:40:03] recently who heard him and believed him
[1:40:06] mostly common people I don't care I'm
[1:40:10] not embarrassed to be associated with
[1:40:12] the common people who heard him and
[1:40:14] believed in their day I've heard him and
[1:40:16] I've believed him in my day are you with
[1:40:19] me let's go
[1:40:21] on those who were were of the other type
[1:40:24] they did not have much time for him cuz
[1:40:27] they were satisfied with their religion
[1:40:29] they liked the gods they like the idols
[1:40:33] they like the competitions and feast to
[1:40:36] their gods they like their Fine Food
[1:40:40] they like to lay down all the time any
[1:40:42] picture you see of Greek uh uh you know
[1:40:45] they're laying down like the Romans
[1:40:47] always you see pictures of the Jews the
[1:40:50] only time they relaxed was to eat the
[1:40:52] rest of the time they're out working
[1:40:55] because if a man doesn't work he doesn't
[1:40:59] eat this is what the Bible said so they
[1:41:02] were of that other type they didn't have
[1:41:04] much time for him because they were
[1:41:05] satisfied with their religion they had
[1:41:07] father fathers had been taught certain
[1:41:09] things and and they'd had their
[1:41:11] Traditions handed down and something new
[1:41:15] no matter how phenomenal it was well he
[1:41:18] tried to tell them it was in Scripture
[1:41:20] that he was to come and oh well if it
[1:41:22] was to be and the priest would know
[1:41:24] something about it and therefore they
[1:41:27] wasn't interested I don't find that hard
[1:41:29] to believe but these
[1:41:33] Greeks these
[1:41:35] Gentiles when they
[1:41:38] heard come on when they
[1:41:43] heard Faith cometh by hearing hearing of
[1:41:48] the word of God they came wanting to see
[1:41:51] Jesus show me
[1:41:53] Jesus I just got to see Jesus I I I see
[1:41:58] you guys and you're nice and
[1:42:02] all friendly
[1:42:04] enough but I I I I've come to see
[1:42:10] Jesus I believe that has been the
[1:42:12] heart's Cry of every man every woman
[1:42:14] who's ever heard anything about Jesus
[1:42:16] Christ has had the same thing
[1:42:18] sir we would see Jesus Lord that ought
[1:42:21] to be the Cry of the Bride
[1:42:25] sir they they didn't want to learn his
[1:42:27] theology they didn't care nothing about
[1:42:28] his teaching they didn't care about
[1:42:30] whether uh what kind of clothes he wore
[1:42:33] they were only interested in one thing
[1:42:36] they didn't come to change him they came
[1:42:37] to see him they're only interested in
[1:42:40] one thing that they wanted to see Jesus
[1:42:44] he said that's the main thing that's the
[1:42:45] Cry of today are you following with me
[1:42:48] sir we would see Jesus 10 years later
[1:42:51] 1964 he said that's why these Greeks
[1:42:54] were desirous to see this man they
[1:42:57] knowed in the word you know they studied
[1:42:59] the Hebrew scripture just like they'
[1:43:01] studied
[1:43:02] Aristotle they knowed that in the word
[1:43:05] what the Messiah was supposed to be and
[1:43:07] they wanted to see him they were
[1:43:10] Gentiles they had heard about him and
[1:43:14] now what they
[1:43:17] wanted in the Mighty God unveiled before
[1:43:20] us the Greeks wanted to to see
[1:43:25] him but they were unable to see
[1:43:30] him because he was in the
[1:43:33] temple of his
[1:43:36] Humanity now now some Greeks couldn't
[1:43:41] even believe what they heard because
[1:43:44] they didn't see how God could come down
[1:43:47] and live as a
[1:43:49] man but these Greeks they wanted to see
[1:43:53] it for themselves it doesn't mean they
[1:43:56] didn't believe it it just means if this
[1:43:59] is going on and I can get enough
[1:44:01] shackles together to get over there I
[1:44:03] want to see this for myself God was in
[1:44:07] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[1:44:10] now we find that that these Greeks could
[1:44:12] not see
[1:44:14] him and notice the very words that Jesus
[1:44:17] expressed to them afterwards I don't
[1:44:20] know who he was talking to afterwards
[1:44:22] but I know he was talking he said except
[1:44:25] a corn of wheat fall into the ground
[1:44:27] dies and abides alone in other words
[1:44:30] they would never be able to see him in
[1:44:32] the change and this is as long as they
[1:44:35] kept the Greek
[1:44:36] mentality they would never be able to
[1:44:39] see God in the change in the mask that
[1:44:44] he was in
[1:44:46] then in Mor because he was veiled in
[1:44:51] human flesh
[1:44:53] they wanted to see a god riding a
[1:44:55] Heavenly Chariot like Zeus or some other
[1:44:58] mythological God but here was a God in a
[1:45:01] in a in in in a in in a simple man with
[1:45:05] a simple garment he wasn't dressed like
[1:45:08] like the the noble of the day or the
[1:45:10] educated of the day or or the rich of
[1:45:12] the day he was wearing a poor man's
[1:45:15] garment no more than the Garment of a
[1:45:18] fisherman and in the Greek mentality he
[1:45:20] couldn't have any importance at all
[1:45:23] do you know we judge people that way too
[1:45:27] sometimes they're a little rag tag
[1:45:29] looking sleep in their eye Etc and we
[1:45:33] think well they couldn't be very much
[1:45:34] it's not that brother we we can't be
[1:45:36] looking at the
[1:45:38] dressing we got to be discovering the
[1:45:40] realness of the heart and so if a man
[1:45:44] approached Jesus with a Greek mindset he
[1:45:47] would not have been able to see him for
[1:45:49] who he was God in human
[1:45:54] flesh now what was his relationship to
[1:45:56] the eternal spirit of the father or what
[1:45:59] was his relationship to the logos he was
[1:46:02] son but he was
[1:46:04] God of the Same Spirit of the same
[1:46:08] Essence and now made flesh so the Greek
[1:46:11] mentality would have kept many Greeks
[1:46:15] from receiving the Lord but there were
[1:46:18] some who were so stri struck struck so
[1:46:22] struck by what they read in the Hebrew
[1:46:24] Bible in the Hebrew scriptures in the
[1:46:26] Hebrew scrolls that they knew there was
[1:46:29] a messiah coming and they begin to think
[1:46:31] perhaps he would come humble and meek
[1:46:33] and lowly and we want to see this Jesus
[1:46:37] to see if he's the one that we're
[1:46:40] looking for as the Messiah oh my which
[1:46:44] kind of Greek would you be if you're a
[1:46:46] gentile here today will you be a Greek
[1:46:48] who approaches things from a Greek
[1:46:50] mentality or will you be willing to turn
[1:46:52] uh off that that that that mentality
[1:46:55] that is the culture of the day and see
[1:46:58] him for who he really is uh not just one
[1:47:01] of the Gods but the only true Living God
[1:47:06] come on and and and he's not an idol on
[1:47:10] a shelf and he's not a baby in a manger
[1:47:15] and he's not a twisted body hanging on
[1:47:18] the
[1:47:20] cross the church wouldn't know Jes
[1:47:25] Jesus the church at large wouldn't know
[1:47:28] Jesus if he walked down the
[1:47:31] aisle that's why the Book of Revelation
[1:47:34] shows us Jesus standing on the outside
[1:47:37] not of your heart but on the outside of
[1:47:41] his
[1:47:43] church my name is above the door but and
[1:47:46] I'm knocking to get in he said If any
[1:47:50] man would come and let me in I would
[1:47:54] have I would have Fellowship I would
[1:47:57] suck with him and he with me anybody
[1:47:59] going to help me
[1:48:01] preach but the church has missed him
[1:48:04] because they have tried to approach
[1:48:07] Faith from a Greek mindset and even many
[1:48:11] around this message have approached God
[1:48:14] and the message from a Greek
[1:48:17] mindset instead of from a Jewish mindset
[1:48:21] which is a biblical mindset when we're
[1:48:24] talking about a Jewish mindset we're not
[1:48:26] talking about modern
[1:48:28] Judaism which is a sad compromise to
[1:48:32] what the scripture talks about more
[1:48:34] man's ideas more man's ideas more man's
[1:48:37] ideas we've got people some who have
[1:48:39] even worshiped with us that would tell
[1:48:41] you that that the
[1:48:43] talmud is equal to the
[1:48:46] Bible oral tradition equal to the Bible
[1:48:49] that's false there are those who would
[1:48:52] tell you that every word and every
[1:48:54] message that brother Brandon preached is
[1:48:57] equal to the Bible that's
[1:49:02] false if oral tradition repeats
[1:49:05] something that was in the scripture I
[1:49:07] say Amen if this message if brother
[1:49:10] Brandon preached something that I can
[1:49:11] find it in the word and see this great
[1:49:15] understanding I say Amen not only with
[1:49:18] my mouth but with my life
[1:49:23] you see this is my life on
[1:49:25] Monday not just on
[1:49:28] Sunday and I pray it's the same for
[1:49:32] you you can't approach Faith from a
[1:49:36] Greek mindset the Bible talks about the
[1:49:39] conflict in the prophets between the
[1:49:42] sons of
[1:49:43] Zion and the sons of Greece the
[1:49:48] Asen of which we believe John the
[1:49:50] Baptist may have found found his later
[1:49:53] home among the
[1:49:56] inin who lived in
[1:49:59] cuman between Jerusalem and the and the
[1:50:03] Dead
[1:50:04] Sea not too far out of
[1:50:08] Jericho where the Dead Sea Scrolls were
[1:50:13] discovered and the writings of the Dead
[1:50:16] Sea Scrolls talk much about this Warfare
[1:50:20] this conflict between the sons of light
[1:50:23] and the sons of Darkness I wonder if
[1:50:26] they were prophetically speaking about
[1:50:28] the hour that we're living in right now
[1:50:30] where there is such
[1:50:32] conflict between the sons of Light and
[1:50:35] the sons of Darkness there is so much
[1:50:38] conflict between the sons of Greece and
[1:50:41] the sons of Zion I'm a son of Zion I
[1:50:44] want to tell the world I want to tell
[1:50:46] the internet I want to tell anybody who
[1:50:48] will listen I identify as a son born on
[1:50:52] the hill of
[1:50:55] Zion I'm not a wreath wearing toga
[1:51:02] wearing clean shaven
[1:51:05] Greek I want my identity to be with the
[1:51:10] sons of
[1:51:12] Zion oh my it's getting
[1:51:15] quiet he's come to ruin our holiday he's
[1:51:18] come to ruin everything I know I knew
[1:51:20] when I came this morning
[1:51:24] they knew what Messiah was supposed to
[1:51:26] be they wanted to see if this was him in
[1:51:30] the message the unveiling of
[1:51:32] God he said the Greeks wanted to see
[1:51:36] him wait a minute let let me go back to
[1:51:38] Mighty God unveiled I didn't finish it
[1:51:40] but when this corn of wheat fell into
[1:51:43] the ground then it could bring forth all
[1:51:46] Races oh I don't want to miss that he
[1:51:49] was sent to the Jews of course at that
[1:51:52] time but this corn his life this this
[1:51:56] seed would fall into the ground veiled
[1:51:59] God God veiled in human flesh hidden
[1:52:04] from
[1:52:05] unbelievers even the Jews couldn't see
[1:52:09] him because he was veiled in human flesh
[1:52:14] but he was being
[1:52:16] revealed to
[1:52:17] Believers he was being revealed to
[1:52:20] Believers he came to the Jewish race
[1:52:23] first but he wanted to reveal himself to
[1:52:27] others but they had to come with with an
[1:52:30] open heart like the Greeks in John 12
[1:52:36] with an open heart they had to come if
[1:52:38] they came with a Greek mindset only they
[1:52:42] would certainly Miss who he was in the
[1:52:45] unveiling of God help us get through
[1:52:47] this the Greeks wanted to see him in St
[1:52:50] John 12:20 you've heard me preach s we
[1:52:53] would see Jesus did you notice that now
[1:52:55] the Greeks were Scholars they were great
[1:52:57] men and they had a great feeling for God
[1:53:00] as Paul preached to them on Mars Hill
[1:53:03] when he said I passed by you I saw the
[1:53:06] inscription to the unknown God he said
[1:53:08] that's your problem Paul said that's
[1:53:11] your problem you don't even know the god
[1:53:13] you worship you call him God and you
[1:53:16] don't even know him you don't know what
[1:53:18] he likes you don't know what he commands
[1:53:21] you don't know what he instructs but you
[1:53:24] like to call yourself identified with
[1:53:26] God there's a lot of people who want to
[1:53:28] be identified with this message of the
[1:53:31] hour with the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:53:33] but they don't want to pay a
[1:53:36] price when it means standing against the
[1:53:39] popular way of doing
[1:53:43] it don't you dare try to take us
[1:53:46] anywhere past Fanny
[1:53:51] Crosby you if a song wasn't written you
[1:53:54] know at least 50 years ago it's not fit
[1:53:57] for our
[1:54:03] churches isn't he the
[1:54:07] same yesterday today and
[1:54:10] forever if he ever inspired a him writer
[1:54:13] can he inspire a him writer today if he
[1:54:17] ever inspired a gospel song of worship
[1:54:20] can't he do it today somebody said some
[1:54:23] worldly group sings that song so I'm
[1:54:26] never going to sing it but you'll sing
[1:54:28] what Elvie Elvis Presley
[1:54:33] sng hadn't been too long ago we sang
[1:54:35] right here How Great Thou Art that's
[1:54:38] right it wasn't the little Church on the
[1:54:40] Hill that made it
[1:54:42] famous so just because uh you know uh
[1:54:46] Elvis the pelvis sang
[1:54:49] it doesn't mean that it wasn't inspired
[1:54:52] of God that's right and doesn't mean
[1:54:54] that it can't be Sanctified and used for
[1:54:57] the work of the Lord just C Porter
[1:54:59] Wagner sung it don't mean I can't sing
[1:55:01] it come on get real folks you're going
[1:55:05] to you're going to be such a
[1:55:07] legalist that you're going to throw out
[1:55:10] something that God isn't don't do it
[1:55:12] don't do it don't do it don't do it well
[1:55:15] but those who sing it jump up and down
[1:55:17] and the girls are in tight jeans and and
[1:55:20] rips in their clothes and and and do you
[1:55:23] see anybody around here doing
[1:55:27] that we're singing the same song
[1:55:29] sometime do you see us doing like that
[1:55:31] do you see do you see women in ripped
[1:55:33] jeans up here men in cargo shorts with
[1:55:35] their baseball cap on backwards up here
[1:55:38] singing like that
[1:55:41] no then we shouldn't be so quick to
[1:55:43] throw the baby out with the bath water
[1:55:45] that's right you think I'm being
[1:55:47] critical I'm actually not not yet it
[1:55:51] could come but but I I haven't hit that
[1:55:54] yet they they were they led the world in
[1:55:57] science and education they were great
[1:56:01] people the Greeks but they worshiped and
[1:56:04] believed in mythology and so books of
[1:56:07] Arts curious arts and so forth
[1:56:12] witchcraft vexes
[1:56:15] and all kinds of things they had pulled
[1:56:19] from many
[1:56:20] religions you see this bumper sticker
[1:56:23] that people have you know tolerance and
[1:56:25] they've got a cross and a star of David
[1:56:27] and a Buddha symbol and a k Quanza or
[1:56:31] whatever else I don't know what people
[1:56:32] are calling themselves these days hary
[1:56:34] krishnam or whatever they are Moonies
[1:56:37] you know remember the
[1:56:39] Moonies I don't know brandom I I don't
[1:56:41] know what kind of something people want
[1:56:44] to be identified with today but I'll
[1:56:46] tell you it's not this idea that there's
[1:56:48] a little bit of good in all of them so
[1:56:50] we'll just all you know just move move
[1:56:52] forward together as one big happy family
[1:56:54] you hadn't read the book I've read
[1:56:57] you're you're not looking at the book
[1:56:58] that I've been taking a look at God said
[1:57:01] there's only one thing we stand on and
[1:57:03] that is his
[1:57:05] word that means I can't stand in
[1:57:07] agreement with with with somebody who
[1:57:09] believes that that the the wafer is
[1:57:13] God once it's been blessed and
[1:57:15] Sanctified they believe that piece of
[1:57:17] bread becomes a substitution for the
[1:57:21] body of Jesus
[1:57:22] and you're supposed to worship that as
[1:57:24] it goes down the aisle on the pole you
[1:57:26] worship that that sun the the the wafer
[1:57:30] with the Rays coming out from it perhaps
[1:57:32] some of you have seen that it is now
[1:57:35] once it's blessed it becomes the Holy
[1:57:36] Eucharist and they believe that that is
[1:57:39] the body of Jesus Christ to to to kiss
[1:57:42] the hand of a priest that carries that
[1:57:45] is to is to kiss
[1:57:47] God so you you you think that I can
[1:57:50] worship like that you think that I can
[1:57:52] join in with that when the Bible tells
[1:57:55] me in in Revelation 18 isn't it come
[1:58:00] out come
[1:58:02] out and be separate sayeth the Lord come
[1:58:07] on we know what the word
[1:58:09] said but they got stirred up about this
[1:58:12] man who could heal the sick and foretell
[1:58:14] things that happened to the dot and they
[1:58:16] got stirred up so did guess what they
[1:58:18] did they just come to see him they
[1:58:20] couldn't turn him on the satellite TV
[1:58:22] they didn't have a satellite TV they
[1:58:24] couldn't find him on the smartphone they
[1:58:26] didn't have a
[1:58:28] smartphone they couldn't fax in their
[1:58:31] questions email their question no no no
[1:58:34] no we want to see him sir we would see
[1:58:38] Jesus you see these Greeks were great
[1:58:40] thinkers thank you for the quote they're
[1:58:42] always seeking more knowledge and higher
[1:58:44] Enlightenment is the phrase they like to
[1:58:47] use no doubt these certain Greeks were
[1:58:49] heirs to the same Greek culture they two
[1:58:52] had probably spent their lives reading
[1:58:54] great
[1:58:55] literature they probably only had a a
[1:58:58] few days growth you know they hadn't
[1:59:00] been living the way of a Jew a Jewish
[1:59:02] person a Bible believer at the time very
[1:59:05] long they were they probably stood out a
[1:59:07] little different they're just making
[1:59:08] their transition They too had probably
[1:59:10] spent most of their lives reading great
[1:59:12] literature stay with me however after
[1:59:15] pondering the great questions of life
[1:59:17] and speculating with Socrates and Plato
[1:59:20] and Aristotle they realize that there
[1:59:23] was a serious Gap in their life they
[1:59:27] knew so much from Socrates Plato and
[1:59:30] Aristotle but they realize there are
[1:59:31] some things we don't know very much
[1:59:33] about there's a great Gap here and we've
[1:59:36] got to find out so they they sought out
[1:59:39] for their answers a great Rabbi from
[1:59:43] Nazareth one
[1:59:45] Yeshua Jesus answered Phillip and Andrew
[1:59:48] when they told him about these Greek men
[1:59:51] basically his answer was I
[1:59:53] die except a corn of wheat to the many
[1:59:56] who sought after him in the gospels to
[1:59:59] all of the Greeks to Judas to the priest
[2:00:03] to the crowds Jesus final answer to all
[2:00:06] of those who questioned him was
[2:00:08] basically the same I
[2:00:13] die it's really the message of
[2:00:17] Christianity it's why people are more
[2:00:19] comfortable with him in a Manger
[2:00:23] it's the gospel that people have such a
[2:00:26] problem with it's how we get the good
[2:00:29] news you don't have any good news unless
[2:00:32] he
[2:00:34] died the good news is not that he was a
[2:00:37] baby the good news is he
[2:00:40] died buried and rose again on the third
[2:00:44] day and now his Spirit lives in US of
[2:00:48] course logically we understand that if
[2:00:51] he had been born he couldn't die we know
[2:00:55] that we're not ignorant of the fact that
[2:00:58] he was born but his birth wasn't like
[2:01:00] other
[2:01:02] births he didn't come from an egg that
[2:01:04] was provided from the body from the
[2:01:07] Fallopian tubes of Mary one Mary a
[2:01:10] virgin he was born of an egg that God
[2:01:13] supernaturally placed in Mary's body she
[2:01:16] was more or less an incubator I know
[2:01:18] that sounds horrible for for the for the
[2:01:21] mentality of Catholics who believe that
[2:01:23] she was also virgin
[2:01:29] born they also believe that Mary was
[2:01:32] virgin
[2:01:33] born no scripture for
[2:01:36] that that's why in Jerusalem there's two
[2:01:40] sites both the the burial of
[2:01:43] Mary and the Ascension of Mary because
[2:01:47] some people believe she died and was
[2:01:49] buried and others believe she never died
[2:01:51] she just ascended from heaven from to
[2:01:54] Heaven from Mount Zion I've been to both
[2:01:58] places that's why tens of thousands
[2:02:01] hundreds of thousands of people around
[2:02:03] the world every day of their life repeat
[2:02:06] this over and over again Hail Mary
[2:02:09] Mother of God full of grace
[2:02:13] and hail Mary Mother of
[2:02:16] God not once not twice 50 times a 100
[2:02:22] times a thousand
[2:02:26] times while praying the the beads on
[2:02:28] their
[2:02:32] bracelet the
[2:02:35] rosary it's big time serious to them
[2:02:39] even though there's no scripture
[2:02:41] anywhere in the Bible nowhere ever does
[2:02:44] it tell us that Mary was immaculately
[2:02:48] conceived or that we should repeat the
[2:02:51] phrase
[2:02:52] is the
[2:02:54] salutation of Elizabeth to Mary that we
[2:02:58] should say that over over again with the
[2:03:00] additional words added by the Catholic
[2:03:01] church and that we should do that
[2:03:03] depending on what the priest tells
[2:03:06] us because we go into a little booth
[2:03:09] father I have
[2:03:10] sin it has
[2:03:13] been 50 years since my last
[2:03:16] confession you have to tell how long
[2:03:17] it's
[2:03:19] been and my S what are your sins my
[2:03:25] son
[2:03:27] boy some of us would never see the light
[2:03:30] of the
[2:03:32] outside we would live in the
[2:03:36] booth I'm not calling names but I'm
[2:03:38] thinking of
[2:03:39] some we'd live in the booth with the
[2:03:41] curtain pulled if we had to name them
[2:03:44] all oh son your sins are not so far
[2:03:48] removed from the sins of others and so
[2:03:50] uh you can be full absolved of your sins
[2:03:53] if it would have been in the time of
[2:03:54] Martin Luther they would have been given
[2:03:55] a
[2:03:57] price how much it would have cost to to
[2:04:00] Spring them you know but today it's not
[2:04:03] uh not really um public celebrated like
[2:04:06] that and so they'll say well son uh you
[2:04:09] can you can uh be fully absolved of
[2:04:12] these sins by saying uh 10 Apostles
[2:04:18] Creeds 40 hail Mares
[2:04:22] and praying the
[2:04:24] rosary at least a dozen times
[2:04:29] tonight and they're
[2:04:32] relieved a good Catholic is
[2:04:36] relieved there's a way
[2:04:38] out come on
[2:04:41] folks no wonder Martin
[2:04:45] Luther as Twisted as some of his ideas
[2:04:49] were no wonder he jumped up off of his
[2:04:53] knees when he read the verse that said
[2:04:54] the just shall live by
[2:04:56] faith Hallelujah not by the Apostles
[2:05:00] Creed not by confession not by the
[2:05:03] rosary but by faith in the shed
[2:05:07] blood not faith in a baby in a Manger
[2:05:11] but faith in the shed blood of Jesus
[2:05:14] Christ not faith in dressing right or or
[2:05:19] wearing your hair right but faith in the
[2:05:22] blood of Jesus Christ brought to you by
[2:05:26] Grace we don't live a separated life to
[2:05:30] be saved we live a Sanctified life
[2:05:34] because we
[2:05:35] are because we are
[2:05:40] saved yes I am praise His name are you
[2:05:44] with me to to the many he answered I die
[2:05:50] it's the same answer to to us who look
[2:05:53] for Jesus in all the wrong places and
[2:05:56] for all the wrong reasons you see there
[2:05:59] are many
[2:06:00] jesuses out
[2:06:03] there for the for the for the many
[2:06:05] people there's about as many jesuses as
[2:06:08] there are people there's a republican
[2:06:12] Jesus there's a Marxist Jesus communist
[2:06:16] Jesus self-help Jesus
[2:06:21] there's a light at the end of the tunnel
[2:06:24] Jesus there's a life coach Jesus there's
[2:06:28] a conservative Jesus some people even
[2:06:31] have a Democrat
[2:06:35] Jesus there is a Black Jesus a white
[2:06:38] jesus a Jewish Jesus an Asian
[2:06:43] Jesus there's a long-haired
[2:06:46] Jesus the Holiness people have a a Greek
[2:06:50] looking Jesus
[2:06:52] with the Greek
[2:06:54] hairstyle there's all
[2:06:57] kinds depends on what you're looking for
[2:06:59] whatever you're looking for in a
[2:07:02] savior you can find
[2:07:05] him and that's why we know that today so
[2:07:09] many people are looking to find a Jesus
[2:07:12] a savior a relief from their problem
[2:07:15] hello some are looking for no more than
[2:07:18] a good Lu
[2:07:19] charm some would be just as satisfied
[2:07:22] with a lucky rabbit's foot look this way
[2:07:23] get off your phones get off your phones
[2:07:25] I'm preaching to you
[2:07:27] today show me a little respect if you
[2:07:30] can't respect me respect the word put
[2:07:32] your phone down come on somebody's
[2:07:36] looking for something that can help them
[2:07:39] and ease their mind and and ease their
[2:07:41] conscience
[2:07:43] and so Jesus is or a d dozen some people
[2:07:47] can only relate to A Jesus who let's say
[2:07:49] is less than 10 or 11
[2:07:53] pounds they can't relate to that Jesus
[2:07:56] that brother brandham
[2:08:00] described only one that's less than 10
[2:08:03] pounds a a baby who's tightly wrapped in
[2:08:06] swaddling clothes that were likely to
[2:08:09] have been the same cloths that had been
[2:08:10] used to wipe down the sweaty filthy
[2:08:12] animals who are lodging nearby I've
[2:08:15] heard some more kind and and and
[2:08:17] glorified explanations for what
[2:08:19] swaddling clothes were but the reality
[2:08:22] is they were stinky
[2:08:25] Rags the sweaty animals had been brought
[2:08:28] down out of the out of the cold into
[2:08:31] leant into caves into sucas whatever was
[2:08:36] available and they had been wiped down
[2:08:38] with rags and if anyone knows what a
[2:08:41] horse looks like when he's when he's
[2:08:42] been
[2:08:43] running and they wiped him down and
[2:08:45] those they she didn't have a registry on
[2:08:49] Amazon Mary
[2:08:52] come she didn't have any bougie
[2:08:55] swaddling
[2:09:00] gowns she grabbed what she had the
[2:09:04] greatest the best Christmas gift people
[2:09:08] like to
[2:09:10] say and you can only say that if you're
[2:09:14] Catholic because Gentiles don't observe
[2:09:18] the
[2:09:19] mass I am not not a
[2:09:24] Catholic my faith is not based on a
[2:09:28] mass when I want to say the birth I say
[2:09:32] the birth of Jesus the birth of
[2:09:36] Christ I don't you say what you like I
[2:09:39] don't have to make him
[2:09:43] Catholic I want him to be I don't want
[2:09:46] him to be Pentecostal either I don't
[2:09:48] want him to be message either I want him
[2:09:51] to be God I don't need a religious Jesus
[2:09:55] I need God I need a God who can help me
[2:09:58] out of my mess I need a God who loves me
[2:10:01] who cares for me I don't need a crying
[2:10:05] snotting pooping baby in a
[2:10:11] Manger I don't need a Jesus that I've
[2:10:13] got to change his
[2:10:19] diaper I got to have one who died for me
[2:10:24] who made his life available to me by the
[2:10:28] baptism of the Holy
[2:10:31] Ghost I've got to have one who has never
[2:10:35] participated in
[2:10:37] Pagan Babylonian Greek or Roman
[2:10:43] practices I've got to have a God who
[2:10:46] never needed a Christmas
[2:10:49] tree to bring him praise or honor Or
[2:10:53] Glory because nobody in their right
[2:10:59] mind
[2:11:01] thinks deep in their heart that that
[2:11:05] Evergreen represents
[2:11:09] Jesus and if it does why do atheists put
[2:11:12] them
[2:11:14] up why do pagans put them up why do
[2:11:17] witches and covens put them up
[2:11:21] why why do Buddhists put them up do you
[2:11:23] know they're Buddhist now because
[2:11:25] Christmas has become a universal holiday
[2:11:28] having nothing to do with faith or truth
[2:11:31] or
[2:11:32] reality and what's crazy is only the
[2:11:34] Catholic Church could pull it off only
[2:11:36] the Catholic Church could make a
[2:11:40] mass to commemorate the birth of a of a
[2:11:43] of a God and the whole world honor it in
[2:11:47] some way or another
[2:11:51] no Pentecostal let me tell you something
[2:11:54] if it was a Pentecostal
[2:11:57] doing if I could prove to you that the
[2:12:00] Pentecostals were the first ones who put
[2:12:01] up the tree no message people would have
[2:12:06] them because they've got prejudice
[2:12:08] against all Pentecostal thoughts come on
[2:12:11] brother preach
[2:12:16] it it wouldn't happen Methodist then the
[2:12:19] Baptist wouldn't want nothing to do with
[2:12:20] it
[2:12:22] but there is a Catholic mass that
[2:12:26] transcends all
[2:12:28] religions and even participated in by
[2:12:32] atheists who believe that they're
[2:12:34] they're
[2:12:36] God man is God they'll tell you man is
[2:12:38] God all men are
[2:12:43] Gods I don't believe in God atheist will
[2:12:48] say and that's why you and I are here to
[2:12:50] remind them
[2:12:52] that God doesn't believe in
[2:12:55] atheist so they're
[2:12:57] equal I don't believe somebody when they
[2:13:00] tell me they don't believe there's a
[2:13:01] higher power they may not be able to
[2:13:04] identify him with a sick
[2:13:07] church are mixed up confused Church of
[2:13:11] 11,000 different
[2:13:13] denominations they may not be able to
[2:13:15] believe in that but I want you to know
[2:13:17] most everybody believes in higher power
[2:13:19] and if you think that's enough to have
[2:13:21] eternal life you're
[2:13:23] foolish there's only one way to eternal
[2:13:26] life and that's through the blood of
[2:13:27] Jesus Christ it's through repentance
[2:13:29] it's not by being good to the bride it's
[2:13:32] by real repentance and the and receiving
[2:13:34] the blood and the
[2:13:36] grace and the gift of God's life then
[2:13:40] you can have eternal life amen amen amen
[2:13:45] not under some trinitarian Doctrine not
[2:13:47] under some false baptism why don't you
[2:13:50] just go ahead and tell it like it
[2:13:53] is brother ROM told us that that the
[2:13:56] demon Spirits travel in those
[2:13:59] titles and if you believe that that's
[2:14:01] such a crazy statement look at the
[2:14:04] condition of the denominational Church
[2:14:06] world oh brother Shel you must think
[2:14:08] this church is doing all right and
[2:14:10] everything here's good not at all didn't
[2:14:13] you hear me tell you that I
[2:14:16] expect that there will be people who
[2:14:18] call me Pastor who will wonder that
[2:14:24] day why the doors aren't
[2:14:29] open why surely brother Shelly would
[2:14:32] have been here by now and unlock the
[2:14:35] door I've already moved out of here is a
[2:14:37] thought you mean to tell me you Pastor
[2:14:40] church and in your mind you really
[2:14:41] expect with everything that's in me I
[2:14:43] really expect it because I heard a
[2:14:45] prophet say in every Church there are
[2:14:48] believers and make Believers and
[2:14:50] unbelievers
[2:14:53] and so yes I expect do you spend your
[2:14:55] life trying to figure out who they are
[2:15:00] never I didn't call you I can't push you
[2:15:04] away I didn't save you I can't unsave
[2:15:09] you but I would be a prideful foolish
[2:15:12] man to think that because you sit under
[2:15:15] my Ministry you're a Believer
[2:15:16] automatically everything you know you
[2:15:19] you you're just going to you know claim
[2:15:21] your association with me and be all
[2:15:22] right folks it is not going to be that
[2:15:24] way there God don't have any
[2:15:26] grandchildren you're not going to be to
[2:15:28] tell the judge my mama had a lot of
[2:15:31] faith my mama my daddy my grandmother my
[2:15:36] grandfather when we meet these folks on
[2:15:38] the road and they say oh you people must
[2:15:40] be Christian you must be Pentecostal you
[2:15:42] must be Hol my mother was my grandmother
[2:15:44] was my grandfather was my my aunt was my
[2:15:47] uncle I need to get back to that you
[2:15:48] sure do that's right I tell them it's
[2:15:51] not too
[2:15:53] late that's right somebody times they
[2:15:55] say it's been 40 years since I've been
[2:15:56] in a church like my mama it's not too
[2:16:01] late you either believe there's one way
[2:16:03] or you believe there's many ways one way
[2:16:06] one Faith one Lord one
[2:16:11] baptism one
[2:16:13] Spirit woo he's wild
[2:16:17] today some people can only relate to A
[2:16:20] Jesus as I said him a moment ago less
[2:16:21] than 10 pounds they see him still in a
[2:16:24] Manger when they think of Jesus they
[2:16:27] still see the shepherd boy standing
[2:16:28] there and the wise men and they assume
[2:16:31] there's three of
[2:16:32] them Bible never says there's three the
[2:16:36] Catholic tradition is
[2:16:38] three because the Catholic Theologian
[2:16:40] said well let's see gold frankincense
[2:16:41] and
[2:16:42] M three gifts so there's three wise
[2:16:47] men not necessarily there might have
[2:16:50] been 10 with gold and 10 with
[2:16:52] frankincense and two with myr there
[2:16:54] might have been 22 there there could
[2:16:56] have been 11 there could have been nine
[2:16:59] and by the way they never made
[2:17:02] it they never made it to the to the cave
[2:17:05] or to the Suka they never made
[2:17:08] it by the time they got there Jesus was
[2:17:11] probably already
[2:17:15] walking somebody said well didn't they
[2:17:17] follow the star there yeah from the long
[2:17:20] way
[2:17:22] away they didn't have a Subway they
[2:17:25] didn't have a jet train come on or Jet
[2:17:27] Plane they didn't have an AM
[2:17:31] track at least you should know that from
[2:17:33] the nativity scene they had camels and
[2:17:36] mules don't you
[2:17:39] know haven't you ever seen the crash
[2:17:41] don't you even know what it looks like
[2:17:43] and and there are people who think that
[2:17:45] there was a special little Hut built you
[2:17:48] know with straw on top
[2:17:51] and it was made specifically for Mary
[2:17:53] and Joseph's to to birth a baby no no no
[2:17:56] no this was something that was used most
[2:17:59] likely at times for worship and other
[2:18:03] times to get the cattle out of the
[2:18:07] rain the manger that you see in your
[2:18:10] little nativity set made out of wood
[2:18:13] never
[2:18:15] existed it never existed in the second
[2:18:17] temple period trees were rare in
[2:18:22] Judea they're scrubs
[2:18:24] today you have to go way up in the high
[2:18:27] mountains of Israel to get a tree that's
[2:18:29] of any height like Alabama everything
[2:18:32] else is kind of scrubby but if you go up
[2:18:34] you can find some there are very few
[2:18:36] Carpenters by the way very few
[2:18:38] Carpenters because there are very few
[2:18:40] trees CU there are very few things made
[2:18:42] of
[2:18:43] wood most things were made of
[2:18:47] stone when you in Israel you never find
[2:18:51] a
[2:18:52] preserved wooden box from the time of
[2:18:55] the second temple but what you will find
[2:18:58] is Stone that has been carved out for
[2:19:01] the cattle to eat out
[2:19:04] of and most likely that was the manger
[2:19:07] he was laid
[2:19:08] in some believe that it was more like a
[2:19:14] shelf used at
[2:19:17] suot but whatever it was it wasn't that
[2:19:20] that little thing with with forked legs
[2:19:23] you know like you have seen your whole
[2:19:25] life come on some people have gone so
[2:19:28] far is to add Jesus to their nativity
[2:19:30] scene bowed down of course I mean uh
[2:19:33] Santa excuse me Santa bowed down of
[2:19:37] course to Jesus Christ someone said
[2:19:39] that's the right message to send to my
[2:19:41] children I want them to know that even
[2:19:43] Santa Claus bows no you want them to
[2:19:46] know that one is a lie
[2:19:51] and one is a
[2:19:53] reality so so figments of that to me
[2:19:56] that would be the same as putting
[2:19:57] Superman bowed down to Jesus in the in
[2:19:59] the manger neither one of them neither
[2:20:01] one of them existed Santa didn't exist
[2:20:04] someone said but he's named after some
[2:20:05] kind of St Nicholas the Catholic church
[2:20:07] was always quick to make somebody a
[2:20:10] saint you read a little bit about his
[2:20:13] life and you'll
[2:20:15] wonder trinitarian baptizing
[2:20:19] titles teaching a Catholic
[2:20:22] Doctrine it's not likely that he was the
[2:20:24] the saint that the the church would like
[2:20:26] for you to think that he was it's like
[2:20:29] having Spider-Man
[2:20:31] or I I don't want to leave you girls out
[2:20:33] Wonder
[2:20:34] Woman bow down and say oh isn't that
[2:20:36] sweet that shows that all powers bow no
[2:20:39] it's showing people that a figment of
[2:20:40] someone's imagination is bowed down and
[2:20:43] and wait to wait you wait till they get
[2:20:45] older and they say to you so is Jesus
[2:20:47] real
[2:20:51] somebody said well none of us would
[2:20:53] would teach our kids like that you would
[2:20:54] have if you hadn't heard the
[2:20:56] truth and some heard the truth and
[2:20:58] contined to do it anyway because they
[2:21:00] didn't have a
[2:21:02] backbone they thought they were going to
[2:21:04] find the kind of Jesus that would make
[2:21:06] them happy would that be the Republican
[2:21:08] one or the Democrat one would that be
[2:21:10] the trinitarian one or the one one one
[2:21:13] you know which one would that be we
[2:21:15] there's only one he's the god of the
[2:21:17] Bible his words are in red you believe
[2:21:19] what he said you do what said are you
[2:21:24] lost somebody said well you know you you
[2:21:27] just can't preach it like that I want
[2:21:28] you to know that some of us got
[2:21:32] saved because of that kind of preaching
[2:21:35] I want you to know some of us heard the
[2:21:37] word because somebody told it Gun Barrel
[2:21:39] straight and every southern gospel song
[2:21:41] that's ever been written about an
[2:21:43] altar has at least one part of a verse
[2:21:45] that says and the old preacher was
[2:21:47] preaching hell hot and Heaven sweet
[2:21:50] we need that sometime that's why I
[2:21:52] started with the idea that one day you
[2:21:56] may stand on the outside of this church
[2:21:59] and wonder where the rest of us
[2:22:03] are how do I know how do I know if I am
[2:22:07] or not ask yourself this question am I
[2:22:14] surrendered to every word of God if you
[2:22:20] can answer yes you can't be
[2:22:28] sure we hope we pray we keep doing
[2:22:34] what's right and what we know to do
[2:22:36] while we work on
[2:22:38] ourselves but the reality
[2:22:42] is one of these
[2:22:45] days there is a
[2:22:47] bride it's going to leave here
[2:22:51] and there's not going to be enough of
[2:22:52] her in this
[2:22:55] nation to make too much of a
[2:22:58] stir we know
[2:23:01] that unfortunately it's true but this is
[2:23:05] the Hope for For the Rest perhaps
[2:23:08] somebody will
[2:23:09] know perhaps some of your loved ones
[2:23:11] will know perhaps some of your friends
[2:23:14] will know that you weren't quite as
[2:23:17] crazy as you seemed you weren't quite as
[2:23:19] religious and fanatical and radical as
[2:23:22] you seemed because no one can find you
[2:23:25] there will be those who feel like you
[2:23:27] you followed your cult leader off into
[2:23:29] the woods and drank Kool-Aid but there
[2:23:31] will be those who knew you who really
[2:23:33] knew you who really loved you who really
[2:23:35] had confidence in you who will know
[2:23:37] where you are and they'll be doing
[2:23:39] everything they can to try to figure out
[2:23:40] how to get there the problem is they'll
[2:23:42] have to do it without the help of the
[2:23:43] Holy
[2:23:47] Spirit it is the truth and it's time we
[2:23:50] be REM mind it that it's the truth well
[2:23:52] you act like you're mad you know why
[2:23:54] that that passion comes because it's all
[2:23:56] you have to fight against it's all the
[2:24:00] things you have to fight against to
[2:24:01] preach the truth like this not from your
[2:24:05] enemies are you my enemy from my
[2:24:12] friends now it goes
[2:24:15] on let's go back to the manger we got
[2:24:17] the Shepherds there we've got I don't
[2:24:19] know how many
[2:24:21] wise men in our mind again although they
[2:24:25] didn't get there for quite a while they
[2:24:28] weren't there January the 4th or 5th
[2:24:29] either no took them a while don't forget
[2:24:33] don't forget that that there's little
[2:24:35] rays of light forming a
[2:24:39] halo around the head of this little 10B
[2:24:44] baby and Mary and Joseph have their
[2:24:46] hands folded and they're looking at
[2:24:49] their little baby
[2:24:51] quite passionately and love
[2:24:54] lovely don't forget you must remember
[2:24:57] that they also
[2:25:01] have unusual hair rays of light coming
[2:25:05] out of their heads because we know how
[2:25:08] the Catholics like their
[2:25:13] Halos I won't say
[2:25:18] it but it's true
[2:25:26] I've heard people say if you'd been
[2:25:28] carrying the picture you wouldn't had a
[2:25:30] car
[2:25:32] EG if You' have had the picture in your
[2:25:38] wallet you you sound worse than a
[2:25:45] Catholic you wouldn't had family
[2:25:47] problems if You' have had the cross at
[2:25:48] your rearview mirror
[2:25:52] these things are not religious icons and
[2:25:54] they are not Lucky
[2:25:56] Charms they're
[2:25:58] memories they're memorials to remind us
[2:26:01] of what God did a generation ago if you
[2:26:04] can't produce that same life today it
[2:26:06] does you no good whatsoever to study
[2:26:09] what God was in
[2:26:12] history a god of history is not what
[2:26:14] this world is looking for today it's a
[2:26:17] god of reality it's a presence Jesus are
[2:26:19] you with me
[2:26:21] it's 122 I have a few more minutes don't
[2:26:23] forget this beautiful little scene that
[2:26:26] people like most folks are more
[2:26:27] comfortable with the meek and humble
[2:26:29] baby Jesus in a manger than they are
[2:26:32] with the lion of the tribe of Judah
[2:26:36] Jesus did you know most churches are
[2:26:38] making Giant Steps toward ultimate
[2:26:40] reconciliation and what that means is
[2:26:42] they're preaching more often now and
[2:26:44] with greater boldness now including men
[2:26:46] like Pat
[2:26:49] Robertson he he was preaching it quite
[2:26:51] strongly there for many years that in
[2:26:55] the end everyone will be saved because
[2:26:57] the judgment is already taken place it
[2:26:59] took place at the
[2:27:01] cross and now ultimately everyone will
[2:27:03] be saved everyone will find their home
[2:27:06] in heaven you've never been to a funeral
[2:27:09] yet where anybody left any
[2:27:12] doubt much if any that everyone has met
[2:27:16] their loved ones
[2:27:18] now folks you need to know that there's
[2:27:20] not a ballroom out there somewhere in
[2:27:22] another dimension where we meet our
[2:27:24] loved ones who went to
[2:27:27] hell and if you go to
[2:27:31] hell you're not going to be meeting your
[2:27:33] loved ones that went to be with
[2:27:35] Jesus there there's not some Gathering
[2:27:38] Place in the etheral world where we all
[2:27:40] get together and then we get sent to
[2:27:42] wherever we deserve to be that's not the
[2:27:45] way it works the reality is you've had
[2:27:48] loved ones to die that you will never
[2:27:51] see them again unless you see them at
[2:27:53] the Judgment that's
[2:27:57] right and if you've had loved ones die
[2:28:00] without Jesus Christ there is no Grace
[2:28:03] or Mercy extended after death the
[2:28:06] scripture said as a man as a tree
[2:28:10] falls he
[2:28:14] lies the Bible tells us that if if you
[2:28:17] die righteous you're right if you die
[2:28:19] ungod Godly your ungodly wherewith shall
[2:28:22] The Sinner and the ungodly appear if the
[2:28:25] righteous scarcely be
[2:28:28] saved I don't understand why we have
[2:28:31] gotten so far from the Bible truth that
[2:28:33] everybody believes their mom and dad
[2:28:35] they're going to see their mom and dad
[2:28:36] and their cousin their uncles and
[2:28:37] everybody who's ever passed away only if
[2:28:40] they
[2:28:41] trusted in the atoning blood of Jesus
[2:28:45] Christ only if they repented of their
[2:28:47] sins
[2:28:50] the Bible said whosoever cth upon the
[2:28:52] name of the Lord shall be
[2:28:54] saved the problem is you can be granted
[2:28:58] eternal life because you called on the
[2:29:00] name of the Lord but if you're born to
[2:29:02] be an overcomer guess what you have to
[2:29:04] do if you were predestinated to be an
[2:29:06] overcomer you've got to
[2:29:08] overcome would God tell you to be
[2:29:11] something and then not give you what you
[2:29:12] needed to be it would he call you to do
[2:29:14] something and not give you the grace to
[2:29:16] do what he called you to do
[2:29:18] hello we got it it if we have got him if
[2:29:22] we abide in the
[2:29:23] vine we can do this we're all working on
[2:29:28] ourself but that doesn't mean striving
[2:29:30] In the Flesh it means yielding it means
[2:29:34] as we preached before come on Jesus walk
[2:29:36] through these
[2:29:39] rooms walk through these closets show me
[2:29:42] what I've got to get out of my life come
[2:29:45] on some of you ought to start in your
[2:29:46] real closet you ought to start in your
[2:29:48] real closet some of you ought to start
[2:29:51] in your
[2:29:52] wardrobe some of you ought to start
[2:29:54] getting rid of those immodest clothes
[2:29:56] low cut tight fitting
[2:29:59] clothes women with men's clothes in
[2:30:01] their closet men with women's clothes in
[2:30:03] their closet not because they belong to
[2:30:05] their spouse but because they belong to
[2:30:07] them you ought to start moving some of
[2:30:08] that out well I may need them if I quit
[2:30:11] going to brother shelle's
[2:30:18] Church you don't need them
[2:30:20] you need to make a stand I'm sick and
[2:30:22] tired of people thinking that they can't
[2:30:24] make a stand for God for Truth for his
[2:30:26] word you can make a stand for everything
[2:30:29] else you stand for gun rights you stand
[2:30:31] for Republican politic you stand for so
[2:30:33] and so if you don't stand for something
[2:30:35] you'll fall for anything can't you stand
[2:30:37] for Jesus can't somebody stand for the
[2:30:40] word can't somebody take God at his word
[2:30:43] we don't have to like it we don't even
[2:30:46] have to understand it but if he said it
[2:30:50] we're Duty bound to try to obey it and
[2:30:53] sometimes we can't do it on our own we
[2:30:55] just have to do it by Grace Lord help me
[2:30:57] I can't do I cannot do this by myself
[2:31:00] there are some folks I just can't love
[2:31:03] by myself I need you to come and love
[2:31:06] them through me and you know what he he
[2:31:09] understands
[2:31:14] that thank you
[2:31:17] brother like I said most folks are more
[2:31:19] comfortable to today with the meek and
[2:31:20] humble little baby Jesus than the lion
[2:31:22] of the tribe of Judah the problem today
[2:31:25] is similar to how it was back then we
[2:31:26] look for a Jesus in all the wrong places
[2:31:29] because we are often looking to glorify
[2:31:33] ourselves I got to find a Jesus who
[2:31:35] agrees with my
[2:31:38] ideas I need a Jesus who agrees with my
[2:31:42] politics I need a Jesus who agrees with
[2:31:45] my
[2:31:46] lifestyle huh that's why there are so
[2:31:49] many uh
[2:31:50] gay and lesbian affirming churches all
[2:31:52] over the world I got to find a Jesus who
[2:31:55] will never never never call me to any
[2:31:57] higher form of righteousness he'll let
[2:31:59] me do what my what my Fallen
[2:32:05] Instinct drives me to do my Fallen based
[2:32:09] nature listen if every one of us went
[2:32:11] out of here and started yielding to our
[2:32:12] fallen based nature we would be no more
[2:32:15] than animals
[2:32:20] monkeys have no sense of loyalty to a
[2:32:23] companion oh yes oh no they don't you
[2:32:26] ever been to the zoo you better run past
[2:32:28] the
[2:32:29] monkey you don't take your small
[2:32:31] children there unless you want them to
[2:32:32] ask a lot of
[2:32:34] questions animals animals
[2:32:39] animals
[2:32:40] hello and that's what this world would
[2:32:43] be and when we
[2:32:45] leave cuz everybody's looking for
[2:32:47] something but they want him to look just
[2:32:50] like them believe just like me m
[2:32:55] yes my Jesus has got on the tie dyed
[2:32:58] t-shirt
[2:33:02] and he don't judge me when I'm smoking
[2:33:05] weed
[2:33:09] and rainbow doesn't mean God's promise
[2:33:13] you know it means it he he Winks at sin
[2:33:20] okay let's move on but the real glory of
[2:33:23] Jesus is found in the last place we
[2:33:25] would ever look not his birth not in his
[2:33:28] miraculous life not in his miracles not
[2:33:31] even in his precious
[2:33:33] words the real glory of Jesus is only
[2:33:36] found in his death burial and
[2:33:40] Resurrection his crucifixion that's why
[2:33:43] he tells us remember
[2:33:45] me not my birth
[2:33:50] not my
[2:33:51] childhood not even my Ministry he said
[2:33:54] remember my
[2:33:56] death remember my death he kept point
[2:33:59] you want to know who Jesus is he's
[2:34:01] pointing us to the selfless one he's
[2:34:05] pointing us to the one who has such
[2:34:07] great love that he laid his life down
[2:34:11] for people who hated him who despised
[2:34:15] him who turned around and not only
[2:34:17] murdered him but tortured him him until
[2:34:20] he
[2:34:22] died and he was doing it for them and he
[2:34:25] prayed he didn't rail he didn't condemn
[2:34:28] he didn't say you idiots don't know what
[2:34:30] you're doing he said father forgive them
[2:34:34] for they know not what they do this
[2:34:36] world will never be able to find the
[2:34:38] authentic Jesus if they keep him in a
[2:34:45] Manger they're looking for Christmas
[2:34:48] spirit
[2:34:50] this time of
[2:34:51] year not Holy
[2:34:55] Spirit my message was titled in search
[2:34:57] of the real Spirit we would see Jesus
[2:35:00] not the Christmas spirit not the I think
[2:35:03] I've been under a cookie Spirit not the
[2:35:05] cookie Spirit not the the real
[2:35:09] Spirit which was selfless
[2:35:15] living Jesus Paid It All oh oh to him I
[2:35:24] give in the message Serv we would see
[2:35:26] Jesus paragraph 104 how different today
[2:35:29] how different today sorry I'm going to
[2:35:32] I'm going to preach on a little bit
[2:35:33] today with the churches of the Disciples
[2:35:35] of today what do they do if you if you
[2:35:38] come to disciples today he's talking
[2:35:40] about the Greeks coming to the discip
[2:35:43] them disciples before they did anything
[2:35:45] they took these Greeks
[2:35:48] right into to the
[2:35:54] presence of
[2:35:57] Jesus I don't know if that physically
[2:35:59] happened or not but I know that's the
[2:36:01] answer yes it is right I know it's the
[2:36:04] answer I know the answer is to get
[2:36:06] people to the presence of Jesus that's
[2:36:09] why you can't invite them to church and
[2:36:11] then sit beside them like a bump on a
[2:36:15] log that's why you can't invite your
[2:36:17] Heathen neighbors and then forget that
[2:36:19] you're a Christian when they
[2:36:23] come that's why you can't clam up not
[2:36:26] worship because you got somebody in
[2:36:28] that's going to know
[2:36:30] you oh I tell you I found real character
[2:36:33] in my wife before I married her we were
[2:36:36] having quite a Revival in Canada and she
[2:36:39] was a manager at a clothing store and
[2:36:41] one of her
[2:36:43] co-workers had come to the Revival
[2:36:45] meeting that night and I'm thinking in
[2:36:46] my mind she'll certainly be dignified
[2:36:52] she she'll certainly restrain
[2:36:54] herself because she is with a co-worker
[2:36:58] that you'll have to face
[2:37:00] tomorrow looking you know cockeyed at
[2:37:04] her what I found was when the presence
[2:37:07] of the Lord came she found out I found
[2:37:11] out that she had the right character she
[2:37:14] wasn't concerned about what the girl
[2:37:16] next to her was thinking or feeling or
[2:37:18] watching
[2:37:20] she just yielded to the presence of the
[2:37:22] Lord ended up in the aisle and through
[2:37:24] the
[2:37:25] doorway she just J dance right through
[2:37:28] the doorway because when the presence of
[2:37:31] Jesus comes you worship well I've got
[2:37:34] family in the message and when they come
[2:37:35] I I just try to watch myself you ought
[2:37:37] to show
[2:37:39] them you'll accomplish more in family
[2:37:42] Harmony by showing
[2:37:45] them that you're going to give God
[2:37:47] attention
[2:37:50] you're not going to leave him in the
[2:37:53] corner with dirty
[2:37:55] feet
[2:37:57] hello them disciples before they did
[2:38:00] anything Lord please let me stay focused
[2:38:03] and
[2:38:03] read they took these Greeks right into
[2:38:06] the presence of Jesus and if he if he's
[2:38:08] the same yesterday today and forever he
[2:38:10] will have to act the same
[2:38:13] today if you're brought into his
[2:38:15] presence disciples today is too much
[2:38:17] difference for today they try to take
[2:38:19] you to a
[2:38:22] cradle or a
[2:38:24] Manger or to a Santa Claus or to a bunny
[2:38:29] that's
[2:38:32] right for Easter bunny rabbit for Easter
[2:38:35] or something another instead of
[2:38:37] Christ instead of Christ brother bram's
[2:38:40] identifying that that that baby in a
[2:38:42] Manger that's not the Christ that people
[2:38:44] are looking for
[2:38:49] they never bring you into the presence
[2:38:51] of
[2:38:57] Christ are you reading ahead I encourage
[2:39:00] you
[2:39:02] to Christmas isn't
[2:39:06] Christ that's not
[2:39:10] Christ it it's it can be warm
[2:39:14] fuzzy it can be family
[2:39:16] time it can be good food
[2:39:20] it can be lots of things but it can't be
[2:39:30] Christ he wouldn't have anything to
[2:39:34] do with something rooted that's right in
[2:39:39] tolerance
[2:39:40] compromise and
[2:39:45] paganism he's not
[2:39:47] honored by your C
[2:39:50] celebration he's
[2:39:52] grieved that you have reduced him to a
[2:39:56] baby in a
[2:39:57] Manger a a a sock on the
[2:40:03] mantle a Christmas
[2:40:08] pudding a tree in the
[2:40:12] corner not where you lay gifts to
[2:40:16] him where you lay gifts to one another
[2:40:21] he must
[2:40:23] wonder what is wrong with people
[2:40:28] today no history anywhere to to identify
[2:40:33] the tree somebody said well Martin
[2:40:35] Luther way before there was a Martin
[2:40:39] Luther trees were being chopped down and
[2:40:42] brought into people's homes to celebrate
[2:40:45] the winter solstice which was yesterday
[2:40:48] the shortest day
[2:40:50] and the longest night is that right
[2:40:53] shortest day longest night of the year
[2:40:56] pagans have been commemorating yesterday
[2:40:58] for hundreds and thousands of years many
[2:41:01] of which did it with an evergreen
[2:41:04] tree before there was a Martin
[2:41:07] Luther you know it's true before there
[2:41:11] was the winter so you you you you move
[2:41:14] back you go all the way back to
[2:41:16] simus you you go back to Saul
[2:41:21] s so you go back to the son
[2:41:24] God it's it's older than
[2:41:28] Catholicism but there was no Jesus
[2:41:31] involved until Catholics got involved
[2:41:34] and they were going to bring Jesus into
[2:41:37] whatever their form of Jesus come on I
[2:41:40] can show you I can show you let's move
[2:41:42] on let's move on Christ isn't Christmas
[2:41:46] isn't Christ today they bring you some
[2:41:48] other PL I don't care how quiet you
[2:41:50] folks get and I want you to know
[2:41:53] something it do does it bother you
[2:41:55] Pastor that all the churches and this
[2:41:58] message I look they can do exactly what
[2:42:02] they want to do that's right some little
[2:42:05] uh uh uh preacher boy of
[2:42:08] sorts made a PO made a public uh reel or
[2:42:12] or some kind of blog or something this
[2:42:14] week and any preacher in this message
[2:42:17] you know that preach I was told I didn't
[2:42:18] want it but you know preaches against
[2:42:21] Christmas where he's just looking for a
[2:42:22] name for himself you've got to be
[2:42:25] kidding me
[2:42:30] kid I already have a
[2:42:32] name
[2:42:35] mud it's been
[2:42:38] mud if you think your
[2:42:40] intimidation or that of the top 10
[2:42:44] preachers is going to move me from what
[2:42:46] God has made so real to me you've got
[2:42:50] another thing coming as long as there's
[2:42:53] life in my body as long as there's
[2:42:55] breath in my body as long as I'm the
[2:42:57] pastor of this church you do what you
[2:42:59] will I'm going to preach the
[2:43:02] truth Christmas isn't Christ
[2:43:06] no today they bring you some other plac
[2:43:09] to some statute some church some
[2:43:11] organization some doctrinal law some
[2:43:13] picture on the wall some belt buckle
[2:43:15] some bolo tie
[2:43:23] but never get you in the presence of
[2:43:26] Christ meeting after meeting after
[2:43:28] meeting prayer line after prayer line
[2:43:30] after prayer
[2:43:35] line it's only a few who see the value
[2:43:40] of getting people into the presence of
[2:43:42] Christ a real true disciple would bring
[2:43:44] you right straight into the presence of
[2:43:46] Christ and from there Christ would show
[2:43:48] you what you had to do are you still
[2:43:50] with me Paradox it'll be a real Paradox
[2:43:53] one of these days when Jesus comes and
[2:43:55] the dead in Christ shall rise mortal
[2:43:56] take on immortality and the Rapture of
[2:43:58] the church comes in this Christmas times
[2:44:01] when people are shopping and dancing and
[2:44:02] drinking and celebrating something that
[2:44:04] they know nothing
[2:44:06] about like they was celebrating
[2:44:08] Washington or Lincoln's birthday not
[2:44:11] worshiping they've still got God In A
[2:44:14] Manger when God is Not In A Manger he's
[2:44:16] raised from the dead alive forever more
[2:44:18] living among proving himself as the same
[2:44:20] God that the nyine fathers carried and
[2:44:22] down Through the Ages has come since the
[2:44:24] day of Pentecost the same God that met
[2:44:26] Paul on the road to Damascus was a
[2:44:28] missionary the Gentile and a messenger
[2:44:29] from God to the Gentiles the Gentiles
[2:44:31] message started by visitation of the
[2:44:33] pillar of fire and it ends the same way
[2:44:36] come on in the message sech we would see
[2:44:39] Jesus I'm being gracious I'm not giving
[2:44:41] you but a few we take the word Christmas
[2:44:43] it's very seldom you ever hear Christ's
[2:44:44] name
[2:44:45] mentioned except Christmas
[2:44:54] the lights and tinsil is all on Santa
[2:44:56] Claus not on Christ till people hardly
[2:44:59] knows what Christmas is really
[2:45:02] for they've just Pagan it's all for
[2:45:06] Jesus happy birthday
[2:45:08] Jesus it's all for
[2:45:12] Jesus it's mostly for gluttony
[2:45:20] hot
[2:45:22] todes that's what it's mostly for we're
[2:45:24] not in my family not in my
[2:45:26] home we're a
[2:45:28] Christian and surely you don't have that
[2:45:30] filthy Pagan Tree in your
[2:45:33] house the lights and tinsil Santa Claus
[2:45:36] they've just paganized it and paganized
[2:45:37] it till it's all become Pagan it's a
[2:45:39] great commercial day now if they want to
[2:45:41] make a commercial day like Mother's Day
[2:45:42] or Father's Day thank you or Son's Day
[2:45:44] or daughter's day that's was kind of
[2:45:46] appropriate he brought me water and
[2:45:48] brother B said you can make a commercial
[2:45:50] day Son's day every day is a Son's day
[2:45:52] every day is a daughter's day that's all
[2:45:55] right but keep the commercial off of
[2:45:56] Christmas I seen a sign not long ago
[2:45:58] said put Christ back in Christmas folks
[2:46:00] here's the reality you can't put him
[2:46:01] where he never was in the first
[2:46:04] place if you had to put him back in
[2:46:07] Christmas you'd be putting him back
[2:46:08] either in the Catholic
[2:46:10] Church which he never was
[2:46:13] there or in the Pagan customs of the
[2:46:16] Heathen now they bring you to a church
[2:46:18] you learn to Creed they bring you to
[2:46:19] Christmas what do you do you see a Santa
[2:46:21] Claus they bring you to a church you see
[2:46:23] an organization they bring you in the
[2:46:24] little neighborhood kids you know and
[2:46:25] have somebody dress up like Santa Claus
[2:46:27] and give them a present but Christ
[2:46:29] brought them to the cross and when you
[2:46:31] get a real disciple they'll point you to
[2:46:33] Christ Christ will bring you to the
[2:46:35] Cross where you are crucified with him
[2:46:37] yes and his eternal life and your life
[2:46:40] meet together and your life dies and you
[2:46:42] take on his eternal life and then you're
[2:46:43] a Son of God Amen what a difference from
[2:46:46] the disciple of old the disciple of
[2:46:47] today
[2:46:49] let's
[2:46:50] skip 19 119 but Christ himself pointed
[2:46:54] people to his death except a corn of
[2:46:55] wheat falls into the ground it abides
[2:46:57] alone 120 oh how different how different
[2:47:00] but your life and his life find each
[2:47:02] other not at the church not in the
[2:47:03] building not in the Creed not in good
[2:47:05] works but in the cross where you are
[2:47:08] crucified with him that's where you find
[2:47:11] Christ you don't find him by doing
[2:47:12] better turning a new page starting a new
[2:47:15] life you don't find Christ you find
[2:47:18] Christ only in death not in a Manger not
[2:47:22] in a confession to believe in certain
[2:47:24] Creeds and fables you don't find Christ
[2:47:27] there a true amen wait a minute I didn't
[2:47:30] hear the
[2:47:31] amens a true servant takes you to him
[2:47:33] and he is the word then brother brandham
[2:47:35] if Christ is on Earth today a real
[2:47:37] servant would take him to him Christ
[2:47:39] well Christ is here in the form of his
[2:47:42] word and the word brings life because he
[2:47:44] is the word Christ is the word yes sir
[2:47:47] he is the word himself the true servant
[2:47:49] takes you to the word sir as we would
[2:47:51] see Jesus same message paragraph 135
[2:47:54] that's the message to get to people not
[2:47:56] a cradle not a Manger Christmas it's not
[2:47:59] mentioned in the entire book of the
[2:48:00] Bibles never one time did Jesus refer
[2:48:03] them to his
[2:48:05] birth somebody said we're doing it for
[2:48:07] him he don't want
[2:48:10] it why can't somebody just get
[2:48:15] it why are you doing it for him he
[2:48:19] doesn't want
[2:48:22] it he doesn't appreciate
[2:48:25] it live for him December 25th and all
[2:48:30] other 364 days of the year and that will
[2:48:34] please his heart your birthday
[2:48:36] celebration for him brings him no praise
[2:48:40] no glory very little attention maybe you
[2:48:43] pray maybe you have the boldness to pray
[2:48:44] a Grace over the meal maybe somebody
[2:48:48] will at least read a few verses of the
[2:48:51] of the Christmas story which is really
[2:48:54] the story of his
[2:48:57] birth that's about
[2:49:00] it and then get then we want our
[2:49:05] gadgets where's my new iPad where's my
[2:49:07] new where's my new where's my new
[2:49:10] hello now I don't have it ready to place
[2:49:13] going to I hope you take this with you
[2:49:14] some of you streamers are you know

[2:49:17] sending me quotes you're all stirred up
[2:49:19] I know you are my church people are
[2:49:22] quiet and they've been living this a
[2:49:23] long time but they're all quiet and I'm
[2:49:25] just just you know deflating all the
[2:49:27] warm
[2:49:29] fuzzies really the Christmas spirit
[2:49:32] don't you feel it aren't you in the AR
[2:49:34] you in the Christmas
[2:49:37] spirit I don't want to be in the spirit
[2:49:40] of anything that's right other than the
[2:49:43] Holy Spirit the spirit of Christ the
[2:49:45] spirit of life and kindness and and love
[2:49:53] gives me indigestion the whole thought
[2:49:55] of
[2:49:57] it and and the fact that why don't you
[2:50:00] just just do it call it something else
[2:50:03] leave his name off of it call it
[2:50:07] Yule call it Soul
[2:50:11] Invictus call it celebrating the
[2:50:14] Equinox leave his name out of it it
[2:50:17] existed before he was ever born
[2:50:22] that's that's the message sir as we
[2:50:25] would see Jesus 135 that's the message
[2:50:27] to get people to not a cradle not a
[2:50:28] Manger Christmas is not mentioned the
[2:50:30] entire books Never one time did Jesus
[2:50:31] refer to his birth but to his death sir
[2:50:34] we would see Jesus one more one more 215
[2:50:37] not not one time did he point any person
[2:50:40] to any Creed any denomination or to his
[2:50:42] birth or even Christmas not one time did
[2:50:44] he ever do it I'm following Jesus I'm
[2:50:47] just following Jesus
[2:50:49] [Music]
[2:50:50] Jesus he never did it he never asked for
[2:50:57] it he didn't want
[2:51:00] it still doesn't want
[2:51:05] it the bathroom is not for Christmas
[2:51:15] trees the Jews believe that it's
[2:51:20] appropriate to hang scripture in every
[2:51:23] room in the house except the
[2:51:28] bathroom there's a warning sometime on
[2:51:31] on Jewish
[2:51:32] art reminding you that the the bathroom
[2:51:35] is not an appr if it it contains
[2:51:37] scripture the bathroom is not an
[2:51:38] appropriate place to hang the scripture
[2:51:42] that's a place for
[2:51:44] evacuation it's a place to get rid of
[2:51:46] the junk
[2:51:50] and then they tell me but I'm putting
[2:51:51] this tree up because I want to remember
[2:51:53] Jesus and honor Jesus and and they've
[2:51:55] run out of places to put
[2:51:58] them so I see message Believers every
[2:52:01] year taking pictures of their trees in
[2:52:04] every room putting them up newly
[2:52:06] decorated hundreds and hundreds and
[2:52:08] hundreds and hundreds thousands of
[2:52:09] dollars they spend because the arburn
[2:52:12] tree they had last year you know or the
[2:52:14] AL or the ten oh excuse me let me let me
[2:52:15] get it right the Tennessee University of
[2:52:17] Tennessee tree they had last
[2:52:22] year it's not good enough for this year
[2:52:24] because the colors have
[2:52:26] changed so we've got to do it all over
[2:52:28] again and we've run out of places to put
[2:52:30] them so guess where we put them now on
[2:52:31] the back of the
[2:52:32] toilet because we don't want anyone to
[2:52:35] be in any room in our house not
[2:52:36] remembering Jesus so the first thing
[2:52:38] they think when they go into the
[2:52:39] bathroom and shut the door and turn
[2:52:41] around looking for the
[2:52:46] commode if they see that little tree
[2:52:48] there and you think for one minute that
[2:52:50] the normal average person
[2:52:55] says he's Jesus in the kitchen Jesus in
[2:52:58] the
[2:53:02] bathroom no they think what idiots live
[2:53:07] here what Christmas
[2:53:17] Fanatics some are
[2:53:21] happy we'll give you a candy cane
[2:53:26] after you'll be all right he never did
[2:53:29] Point anyone to anywhere else to know
[2:53:31] him but the cross and that self-
[2:53:33] crucifixion to yourself this is part of
[2:53:36] the
[2:53:37] crucifixion it's not fun to be the
[2:53:40] oddbird out the odd man out it's not
[2:53:44] fun it's not fun don't you just love
[2:53:48] Christmas and you have to say
[2:53:50] well my favorite what what is your
[2:53:53] favorite day of the year I always answer
[2:53:56] if I if I think it's appropriate
[2:53:58] December
[2:54:01] 26th why December 26th because Christmas
[2:54:04] is over for another year praise
[2:54:10] God you know I spared you I told I told
[2:54:13] some of the kids I told Amelia and and
[2:54:16] uh Nora I said I'm going to buy me a
[2:54:19] grinch hat and I'm going to wear it to
[2:54:21] church and preach this
[2:54:23] message I don't want to be the Grinch
[2:54:25] that stole
[2:54:28] Christmas it's not
[2:54:31] fun I never used I never used the word
[2:54:35] Santa in our home until our children
[2:54:37] were were quite
[2:54:41] old i i i shielded them to the best of
[2:54:44] my ability and when we saw one I would
[2:54:46] say oh look oh look it's Moses in a red
[2:54:56] suit and it's funny it is
[2:54:59] funny it is funny but Moses was
[2:55:03] real see and the other stuff
[2:55:07] wasn't
[2:55:08] [Music]
[2:55:09] amen I'm not done but nearly
[2:55:13] nearly Jesus never did write a Creed he
[2:55:15] never did ordain a denomination he he
[2:55:18] said wait a minute go back and that is
[2:55:19] self- crucifixion to yourself except a
[2:55:21] man be born again then in the manger
[2:55:22] Santa Claus he said Jesus never did
[2:55:24] write a Creed and never did ordain an
[2:55:26] nomination and then why is it we take so
[2:55:28] much of it and even lay every
[2:55:29] responsibility on it I want to ask you
[2:55:31] that Christmas now why is it that our
[2:55:34] churches lay so much on
[2:55:39] it you you you must belong to this
[2:55:42] church you got to say this Creed you got
[2:55:43] to do this listen there are churches
[2:55:46] around this message where if anyone d
[2:55:50] cares to
[2:55:53] not they are
[2:55:58] humiliated if they don't put the tree if
[2:56:01] they don't make the party if they
[2:56:05] don't we've got churches around this
[2:56:08] message that have already been busy a
[2:56:10] month Sunday school teacher party you
[2:56:13] youth party uh uh old adult party single
[2:56:16] party married couple party
[2:56:19] but they don't put much on
[2:56:22] Christmas it's all for Jesus why do they
[2:56:25] lay so much on it if it's not important
[2:56:28] it shows we've got a different kind of a
[2:56:29] disciple today they want to bring you to
[2:56:31] their Church to their
[2:56:33] denomination to their Creed and not to
[2:56:35] their Christ I don't have time to play
[2:56:37] it
[2:56:38] tonight
[2:56:40] today is it tonight
[2:56:43] already but Joshua sent me um a clip
[2:56:49] that I've never seen
[2:56:50] before brother Billy Paul is speaking
[2:56:53] somewhere in a foreign
[2:56:57] land I'm assuming somewhere in Europe
[2:57:00] but it I could be wrong and there he's
[2:57:03] taking some
[2:57:04] questions and they ask him about the
[2:57:06] Christmas tree is it all right we
[2:57:09] understand and and brother Billy Paul he
[2:57:12] he takes a long time to
[2:57:14] answer he just kind of smiles and he
[2:57:17] said well
[2:57:18] the truth is he said there was a deacon
[2:57:20] in the Tabernacle who worked for the
[2:57:22] Forestry Department and yes he would cut
[2:57:26] down a tree every year and leave it on
[2:57:27] the
[2:57:28] porch and sometimes dad would put it up
[2:57:31] for the
[2:57:32] kids now that's on
[2:57:36] him and and that's why I cling to that
[2:57:39] quote when he said don't you pay any
[2:57:41] attention to the messenger you just stay
[2:57:44] with the
[2:57:45] message are you calling brother Brandon
[2:57:47] a hypocrite no he may have had reasons
[2:57:48] for doing that I I it's none of my it's
[2:57:51] just simply to be honest with you it's
[2:57:52] just none of my
[2:57:54] business but I'm going to stay with what
[2:57:56] he said all of it all of it and the
[2:57:59] evidence is is
[2:58:01] clear much more negative than
[2:58:05] Pro they ask him about presents and
[2:58:08] because we all know brother Brandon
[2:58:09] would say Merry Christmas at times and
[2:58:11] then other times he said I'm not
[2:58:12] goodness it's not exactly a Merry
[2:58:13] Christmas it's Christ be with you that's
[2:58:16] good Christ be with you Monday Sunday
[2:58:19] Christ be with you spring fall summer
[2:58:22] winter Christ be with you God bless you
[2:58:25] that's what we're saying God bless you
[2:58:27] brother Christ be with you fine but
[2:58:30] sometimes he would mention we have a
[2:58:31] little something for the
[2:58:33] kitties look the little something for
[2:58:35] the kitties was not an
[2:58:37] iPod it was tangerines oranges apples
[2:58:41] and and some walnuts and a few pieces of
[2:58:44] hard candy in a bread bag
[2:58:48] that was the treat that'll work
[2:58:51] anytime you you give me a few pieces of
[2:58:53] candy and walnuts no I'll take it he
[2:58:56] said we got a little Su for the kitties
[2:58:57] he said thank you for the present the
[2:58:59] suit came from the church
[2:59:02] look the reality is you can buy me a
[2:59:04] suit
[2:59:06] too don't call it Christmas present but
[2:59:09] just say God bless you Pastor you're
[2:59:11] you're outgrowing that one or whatever
[2:59:14] be nice be nice you've had too many
[2:59:16] cookies whatever be nice
[2:59:18] but I love this I've never heard this
[2:59:21] they ask him about he brother Billy Paul
[2:59:23] said but let me let me tell you this he
[2:59:24] Saidi never knew dad he said we bought
[2:59:27] them for each other the kids but he said
[2:59:30] I never knew dad to buy anybody any of
[2:59:33] us a birthday a Christmas
[2:59:39] present and you know that means
[2:59:42] something to
[2:59:44] me I know he was a generous man I know
[2:59:47] he gave to to his family and I know he
[2:59:49] gave to
[2:59:50] others but there must have been some
[2:59:52] reason
[2:59:54] why that to his even his own children he
[2:59:58] said he just said he didn't do it there
[3:00:01] must be a reason he must have had
[3:00:04] something in his heart so during this
[3:00:06] time of year when people are searching
[3:00:08] for the Christmas spirit musicians are
[3:00:11] coming according to our culture you
[3:00:14] don't even know what the Christmas
[3:00:15] spirit is unless you watch the Hallmark
[3:00:17] Channel
[3:00:19] you're full of Christmas spirit when you
[3:00:21] have warm fuzzy
[3:00:23] feelings you're watching you know
[3:00:28] sappy love
[3:00:30] stories wearing red wool socks and
[3:00:33] drinking hot
[3:00:37] chocolate you know you have the
[3:00:39] Christmas spirit when you're partaking
[3:00:40] in all the festivities beginning with
[3:00:42] family and friends and bacon goodies and
[3:00:44] candy canes and santon toys and
[3:00:46] Christmas songs most of which by the way
[3:00:48] were written by Jewish
[3:00:49] songwriters giving and receiving gifts
[3:00:52] and the Christmas dinner is all Central
[3:00:54] to the spirit of
[3:00:56] Christmas one of the most important
[3:00:58] parts of of participating in the spirit
[3:01:00] of Christmas is the decking of the tree
[3:01:02] with ornaments in fact not having a tree
[3:01:04] or enjoying decorating one is the
[3:01:07] Tipping Point for most of those who
[3:01:08] don't have the Christmas spirit they'll
[3:01:11] just tell you right out you have no
[3:01:12] Christmas spirit you're the Grinch for
[3:01:14] good measure throw into the mix of
[3:01:15] Christmas cheer one must be loving and
[3:01:18] generous then you are set to have the
[3:01:21] Christmas spirit if any of you have done
[3:01:23] any shopping this week even buying
[3:01:26] groceries you've already realized that
[3:01:28] most of the loving
[3:01:29] cheer and generosity of the Christmas
[3:01:32] spirit has melted away through the years
[3:01:35] and that's why a young 24 year old
[3:01:37] mother in Mississippi friends of
[3:01:42] friends her and her family accidentally
[3:01:45] pulled out in front of someone coming
[3:01:48] out of a Walmart parking
[3:01:50] lot he followed them home with an
[3:01:52] automatic rifle and shot the
[3:01:56] yard shot the car the husband survived
[3:02:00] the 24 year old mother died the last I
[3:02:03] heard the infant child was in intensive
[3:02:09] care he must have thought they got the
[3:02:11] last
[3:02:14] doll or the last electronic
[3:02:20] his Christmas cheer had ran
[3:02:23] out what I see is sick what I feel is
[3:02:29] satanic what people call the Christmas
[3:02:32] rush to me is the same kind of rry
[3:02:36] spirit that represent that's represented
[3:02:38] by
[3:02:42] Migra it's the same kind of spirit
[3:02:45] that's represented in a in all you can
[3:02:47] eat Buffet sitting in
[3:02:53] a casino a
[3:03:02] casino Isaiah 1520 woe unto them that
[3:03:05] call evil good and good evil they put
[3:03:07] Darkness for light and light for
[3:03:08] Darkness they put bitter for sweet and
[3:03:10] Sweet for
[3:03:13] bitter search as one might the Christmas
[3:03:16] spirit can't be found in the scripture
[3:03:18] it's a false Spirit where works and
[3:03:20] feelings promote personal happiness the
[3:03:23] Christmas spirit is
[3:03:25] seductive because it mixes holy and
[3:03:29] profane two more now the Christmas
[3:03:32] Divine Healing now the Christmas is not
[3:03:34] a Protestant holiday it's a Catholic day
[3:03:37] the 25th of December was months and
[3:03:39] months before our or after before our
[3:03:41] Lord was born meaning it was already
[3:03:43] marked our Lord was born in April but he
[3:03:46] wasn't born in December if if you've
[3:03:48] been in Judea in December it's cold you
[3:03:49] know that he wasn't it's spelled c h r i
[3:03:52] s
[3:03:54] t Mas a Mass for Christ it's the Christ
[3:03:58] mass in Acts of the Holy Spirit now as
[3:04:01] we're approaching Christmas time now and
[3:04:03] here the things are decorated all up
[3:04:04] with Santa Claus instead of Jesus they
[3:04:06] don't even spell it anymore exmas is
[3:04:08] what they put they don't even spell
[3:04:09] Christ in Christmas anymore I I think it
[3:04:11] I think that's just good fine no problem
[3:04:13] I have no problem with that he doesn't
[3:04:15] belong there
[3:04:17] why the people never never even think
[3:04:19] about the birth or anything of Christ
[3:04:20] what it's really for only thing they
[3:04:22] think about is Santa Claus took his
[3:04:24] place and instead of rejoicing listen
[3:04:26] instead of rejoicing under the spirit of
[3:04:28] God can can I just hold my finger there
[3:04:32] they call off
[3:04:39] church it's a good thing that it's on
[3:04:43] Wednesday because we'll
[3:04:45] see among our rign
[3:04:48] we'll see won't we how many have a
[3:04:52] service on Wednesday night it's about
[3:04:53] Christ you know come
[3:04:56] on he said instead of rejoicing under
[3:04:59] the spirit of God they go out and get
[3:05:02] drunk and rejoice see that's what makes
[3:05:04] the difference men will be lovers of
[3:05:06] pleasure more than lovers of God he goes
[3:05:09] on and I'm
[3:05:12] closing I will War you to talk in the
[3:05:14] end about syncretism
[3:05:18] but I won't take time much
[3:05:20] time syncretism is the
[3:05:23] blending of all kinds of religious ideas
[3:05:26] and philosophies and theories with any
[3:05:29] other
[3:05:30] religion hoping to make it more
[3:05:35] palatable there would have been no
[3:05:38] Trinity except for the fact that there
[3:05:40] were many pagans coming to Faith and
[3:05:43] they were having such a hard adjustment
[3:05:46] moving from a polytheistic idea of God
[3:05:48] being many gods into a monotheistic idea
[3:05:52] of God being
[3:05:53] one leave it to the to the early church
[3:05:56] fathers especially those already formed
[3:05:58] under the Catholic church and meeting in
[3:06:00] the Creeds like the Nan
[3:06:03] Creed they decided there's one way that
[3:06:05] we can present God that would be
[3:06:08] less difficult to comprehend to the
[3:06:11] Pagan coming to the
[3:06:13] faith we will make God
[3:06:16] three three people acting as
[3:06:21] one
[3:06:22] VOA the Trinity is
[3:06:26] born that ought to disturb
[3:06:29] you it's accepted now in in in almost
[3:06:33] every major denomination in the world it
[3:06:36] it started as a
[3:06:37] compromise now it's become more than a
[3:06:39] compromise such a false doctrine that
[3:06:42] keeps people away from the real Christ
[3:06:44] hello hello
[3:06:49] same thing
[3:06:51] happened this is before this is before
[3:06:54] Constantine this is before
[3:06:57] Emperors made the decision to make
[3:06:59] Christmas Christmas as a national and
[3:07:02] international
[3:07:03] celebration people were already
[3:07:05] celebrating on December the 25th they'd
[3:07:08] been doing it for Generations
[3:07:11] centuries there were so many pagans
[3:07:13] coming to Christ praise the Lord praise
[3:07:15] the Lord praise God that there were
[3:07:17] pagans coming to Christ so why don't we
[3:07:21] just present to them the pure Gospel of
[3:07:23] scripture let them come out of their
[3:07:26] Darkness let them leave their P Pagan
[3:07:28] ways behind them and follow Christ
[3:07:30] wholeheartedly no the Catholic Church
[3:07:34] decided we've got to make it more
[3:07:38] palatable we can't take their
[3:07:40] celebrations from them so we'll combine
[3:07:44] theirs with ours it's called syn
[3:07:50] ISM it explains so
[3:07:53] much it's the idea that what we believe
[3:07:56] can be more
[3:07:58] palatable if we water it down with more
[3:08:02] comfortable
[3:08:04] words more tolerance more
[3:08:09] acceptance you know uh
[3:08:12] universalism we're all going to be saved
[3:08:14] in the end nobody's granddaddy went to
[3:08:19] hell you don't have to give up your
[3:08:22] Pagan ways we'll just make it part of we
[3:08:25] we'll just take a tree that's been
[3:08:26] decorated for years to celebrate false
[3:08:29] gods and we'll just tell them we're
[3:08:31] doing it for
[3:08:33] Jesus come on
[3:08:36] folks it's
[3:08:38] syncretism it's
[3:08:41] filth he says so it's not not the mixing
[3:08:45] of sweet and bitter it's it's it's the
[3:08:47] mixing of Darkness and
[3:08:50] Light and if you can't stand in this
[3:08:53] wicked hour and be the
[3:08:57] fish can't we have meals with our family
[3:09:01] sure you can and you should if you have
[3:09:05] a
[3:09:06] family that can respect what you
[3:09:09] believe you ought to be with them don't
[3:09:12] you shove anything down their throats
[3:09:14] don't you get preachy don't you be
[3:09:17] religious don't you be a
[3:09:23] fanatic enjoy your time together the
[3:09:27] reality is some of us don't have
[3:09:29] families like
[3:09:33] that we some of us have families that
[3:09:35] are going to force
[3:09:38] presence they're going to force their
[3:09:41] particular traditions and celebrations
[3:09:43] and it has to be done the way they've
[3:09:45] done it for years
[3:09:48] and when that's the case we're for we're
[3:09:51] forced with a revelation 184 decision
[3:09:54] come out from among them be separate
[3:09:56] sayith the
[3:09:59] Lord I I'm telling you the
[3:10:01] truth what do we do then we find other
[3:10:04] times we love them we fellowship with
[3:10:07] them we don't condemn others we don't
[3:10:09] act Pious or legal or
[3:10:13] religious I've had people say to me I
[3:10:16] have a letter on my desk from a saint
[3:10:19] from many years
[3:10:20] ago I'm writing to tell you before
[3:10:23] someone else tells
[3:10:25] you I gave in this
[3:10:30] year my family
[3:10:33] insisted my grown children insisted on
[3:10:36] putting up a tree in my house for their
[3:10:40] celebration I didn't want you to find
[3:10:42] out from somebody else so I'm writing to
[3:10:44] let you know
[3:10:48] I appreciated the sentiment I
[3:10:51] appreciated the
[3:10:54] kindness perhaps it normally wouldn't
[3:10:56] have even bothered me the way it
[3:11:01] did but the reality was something
[3:11:05] gripped my
[3:11:07] heart and
[3:11:09] said I I don't know why this came but
[3:11:12] something gripped my heart and said well
[3:11:14] it'll be the last Christmas
[3:11:17] that you ever celebrate with them on
[3:11:20] this
[3:11:21] Earth I didn't prophesy that it wasn't
[3:11:24] my wish or my desire or my
[3:11:29] hope it wasn't the fact that I wanted
[3:11:33] someone to be punished I think the
[3:11:35] children though they were grown should
[3:11:37] be
[3:11:40] spanked
[3:11:43] shamed for dragging that into their
[3:11:45] mother's home I didn't do I think that's
[3:11:50] disrespectful just like these backslid
[3:11:52] gals that wear their tight britches to
[3:11:53] their Mom and Daddy's house
[3:11:56] knowing that they've got a standard of
[3:11:58] life if you can't respect somebody
[3:12:00] enough to to be decent stay
[3:12:04] home boy that's tough isn't
[3:12:07] it I don't know why that came but it
[3:12:09] came so
[3:12:11] real well it'll be the last
[3:12:13] one if you can't stand just in my heart
[3:12:16] this came if you can't
[3:12:18] stand it'll be the last one I I somehow
[3:12:22] came to the understanding in my mind
[3:12:24] that it must be the Lord saying I can't
[3:12:27] leave you
[3:12:30] here brother brandom talks about the the
[3:12:33] man before he went too far he was
[3:12:36] already
[3:12:38] drinking smoking cigarettes already
[3:12:40] already far but before before he got too
[3:12:44] far God took him and I just had this
[3:12:48] idea if if they can persuade you that
[3:12:50] way what else will they persuade
[3:12:54] you and he loved her too
[3:12:57] much to let her go back to her
[3:13:02] lipstick and her
[3:13:04] slacks just come home then you can spend
[3:13:07] every holiday with
[3:13:09] me I I I don't even know why I shared
[3:13:12] that I'm not trying to instill any kind
[3:13:13] of fear in anybody it wasn't wasn't a
[3:13:15] fear tactic it it was just simply I
[3:13:17] believe God wants to give us
[3:13:19] courage love one another there are
[3:13:22] biblical
[3:13:25] options there are things that we can do
[3:13:28] together that are not Pagan nor
[3:13:32] perverted things that Jesus honored and
[3:13:34] respected like the rededication of the
[3:13:39] temple the reality ass seared we would
[3:13:41] see
[3:13:42] Jesus and we need to be the kind of
[3:13:44] disciples that will immediately bring
[3:13:46] people into the presence of the Lord not
[3:13:49] to a Creed not to a
[3:13:52] compromise but bring them straight into
[3:13:54] the presence of the Lord how many of you
[3:13:57] want to be that kind I want to bring
[3:13:59] them to Christ nothing else let's
[3:14:12] stand he's the light
[3:14:17] of the
[3:14:21] world and he shines his light upon us

[3:16:52] [Music]
[3:16:56] he's Jesus oh Jesus is the
[3:17:02] light of the world play that would you
[3:17:06] softly he's the
[3:17:11] light may not be the season of his
[3:17:15] birth but it's the season season of
[3:17:18] rededication it's a season of Miracles
[3:17:21] it's the season of
[3:17:28] light we believe God took a little pot
[3:17:31] of oil only enough oil for one
[3:17:35] night and he multiplied it eight
[3:17:38] nights as the temple was being taken
[3:17:42] back from pagans
[3:17:47] they offered Pig Blood on the altar of
[3:17:51] God and they erected a statue of
[3:17:54] Jupiter in the Holy
[3:17:58] place a little Band of Brothers said
[3:18:01] whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa we'd
[3:18:03] rather die fighting for
[3:18:06] truth than live under the Tyranny and
[3:18:10] debauchery of paganism in the Holy
[3:18:13] Place many gave their lives yes to fight
[3:18:18] against the resistance they were the
[3:18:21] resistance fighting against the
[3:18:24] [Music]
[3:18:25] majority when God gave them
[3:18:28] Victory unbelievable Victory how do a
[3:18:33] little band of fellows stand against an
[3:18:35] army of literal
[3:18:39] elephants it's recorded in the
[3:18:43] mccabes elephants
[3:18:47] that would be like tanks
[3:18:49] today and God gave them
[3:18:53] Victory a bunch of moms and dads went
[3:18:57] into that Holy place and they scrubbed
[3:18:59] the pig blood off the altar they made
[3:19:02] sure the Jupiter's statue was drugg out
[3:19:04] and
[3:19:05] burned and they wanted to light the holy
[3:19:08] manora they set it back up in
[3:19:10] place some people say it's just a
[3:19:13] tradition well there are people who say
[3:19:15] Jesus is just a tradition
[3:19:17] I know better than that they find a
[3:19:20] little pot of Sanctified
[3:19:22] oil would have taken too many days to
[3:19:26] consecrate new oil so
[3:19:28] they at least ate they said we'll just
[3:19:32] use what we
[3:19:33] got joy joy joy just a little bit of Joy
[3:19:36] use what you got it don't take a whole
[3:19:37] lot you know and God gave him a
[3:19:40] miracle he let the monora stay lit
[3:19:44] for eight nights
[3:19:48] so it's a season of Miracles it's a
[3:19:49] season of
[3:19:51] light it's a season of Consecration and
[3:19:54] dedication it's a season to wage war on
[3:19:59] compromise in your
[3:20:01] life I may die in the
[3:20:04] fight but that's what he wanted to bring
[3:20:06] me to anyway unless the unless a corn of
[3:20:10] wheat goes into the ground and dies it
[3:20:13] abideth
[3:20:14] alone but if it dies it
[3:20:17] multiplies Hallelujah and the Harvest is
[3:20:21] bigger than the seed so regardless of
[3:20:24] what you're
[3:20:25] doing let this be a time as we come to
[3:20:28] the end of the
[3:20:29] year on the Gregorian calendar let it be
[3:20:32] a time of Recon Lord where have I let
[3:20:34] the enemy creep
[3:20:36] in where have I let compromise come
[3:20:40] in somebody said well do I have to turn
[3:20:43] my head when I see Christmas lights I
[3:20:45] just told you it's a a season of
[3:20:50] Lights you don't have to be a
[3:20:53] fanatic I just wish they knew why they
[3:20:55] were putting them
[3:20:57] up it's more than a high power electric
[3:21:01] bill I just wish they wouldn't
[3:21:03] synchronize them to Jingle Bell
[3:21:06] Rock I just wish they would let
[3:21:08] everybody know I'm doing this because I
[3:21:11] want to tell the whole world that Jesus
[3:21:13] is the light not Santi Santa Claus Jesus
[3:21:16] is alive you ever pass a home and see a
[3:21:19] blow up of Jesus standing in the front
[3:21:21] yard with his arms wide open then you
[3:21:23] can really say you've seen something but
[3:21:25] it'll usually be Frosty or the or boes
[3:21:27] in a red
[3:21:29] suit I want to be a
[3:21:31] light I want my neighbors to know I want
[3:21:35] those I come in contact with every every
[3:21:37] day to
[3:21:38] know I want to stand on the word even
[3:21:41] when it's not
[3:21:43] popular I don't want to run my loved
[3:21:45] ones off I don't want to run people off
[3:21:47] but I want to stand with the
[3:21:49] word and I hope you will
[3:21:52] too Jesus is the light of the world not

[3:28:01] life may have nothing to do with
[3:28:04] holiday but but you recognize that
[3:28:06] there's still mixture in
[3:28:09] you you want the wisdom of the Lord the
[3:28:13] leadership of God to help you deal with
[3:28:16] the
[3:28:17] mixture because if you know your
[3:28:20] heart you know that you want to be holy
[3:28:23] before him and and that comes not by
[3:28:27] works but by yielding more of your life
[3:28:29] and will to him and if you're here today
[3:28:32] and you'd say I recognize that there's
[3:28:34] still a mixture of light and darkness
[3:28:36] there's still bitter and sweet there
[3:28:37] there there's
[3:28:41] still some parts of me
[3:28:44] that I really need to consecrate to the
[3:28:47] Lord I I want to ask you to
[3:28:51] come I want to ask you to come and stand
[3:28:54] with us just a moment we'll make this
[3:28:57] quick no
[3:28:59] pressure it's only if you feel that this
[3:29:05] applies we're just going to sweep around
[3:29:07] our altar
[3:29:11] [Music]
[3:29:24] we want to pull down every every
[3:29:27] sign every message that we're sending
[3:29:30] out of our life that's mixed
[3:29:35] confusion every every message that
[3:29:38] that's coming off of
[3:29:41] us that's a little bit of light a little
[3:29:44] bit of Darkness we're want to pull that
[3:29:47] down we want his
[3:29:51] light we want Jesus Christ the same
[3:29:54] yesterday today and
[3:29:55] forever to be the theme over our lives
[3:29:59] we want that to be the message we send
[3:30:01] and what we say how we dress where we go
[3:30:04] how how we live our
[3:30:05] lives how we live in the world but not
[3:30:08] of the
[3:30:10] world so if you've come forward because
[3:30:13] you wanted to just acknowledge I need a
[3:30:15] little help from him oh I think it's
[3:30:17] wonderful if you're streaming the
[3:30:19] service and you feel the
[3:30:21] same just let him know Lord here I
[3:30:24] am I I want to sweep around my altar I
[3:30:27] want to scrub a little I I just want to
[3:30:30] make sure that all is in order I don't
[3:30:32] want any odd against anybody any
[3:30:34] Prejudice any
[3:30:35] [Music]
[3:30:36] Envy I just want to be able to discern
[3:30:39] you in my life and in the life of
[3:30:43] others if you feel that way then I want
[3:30:45] us to pray pray together father we are
[3:30:48] here today your
[3:30:51] servants and it becomes our
[3:30:55] responsibility even when we're not asked
[3:30:58] to show you Jesus to those that we come
[3:31:02] in contact with our friends and
[3:31:04] neighbors they may never our co-workers
[3:31:07] they may never find the courage that the
[3:31:09] Greeks had to come and say sir we would
[3:31:11] see
[3:31:13] Jesus but it remains our responsibility
[3:31:16] and obligation to show
[3:31:19] you to those who seek
[3:31:21] you in Purity and love and in
[3:31:26] Holiness with real
[3:31:28] concern and sometimes we can't do that
[3:31:31] because we've let some things come in
[3:31:33] that's dimmed our light a little bit and
[3:31:36] we've compromised on some areas of
[3:31:39] truth that cause a mixed signal to be
[3:31:42] sent out from our lives so today here we
[3:31:44] are Lord standing around on this
[3:31:46] altar knowing that we can't do it for
[3:31:49] ourselves so we've come to
[3:31:52] you because you are able to do for us
[3:31:56] what we cannot do for ourselves Here We
[3:31:59] Stand our heart stretched before you
[3:32:02] believing that by your
[3:32:05] grace and your sanctifying
[3:32:09] power you will give us
[3:32:12] Grace to drag the Jupiter
[3:32:16] out of the Holy
[3:32:19] place to take jealousy by the
[3:32:24] throat and pull it down in our
[3:32:28] lives whatever it is that the enemy uses
[3:32:31] to condemn us or confuse us may we find
[3:32:36] the courage of the
[3:32:38] mccabes to stand against
[3:32:41] compromise and say we don't want to face
[3:32:43] a living God at the at the end of our
[3:32:46] life if we live a long life knowing that
[3:32:51] we got weaker and weaker in our
[3:32:52] testimony and weaker and weaker in our
[3:32:55] faith Lord breathe breath breathe your
[3:32:58] life right now over these precious
[3:33:00] dedicated people who are standing in
[3:33:03] your presence to be all that you have
[3:33:06] created them to be and some of them will
[3:33:08] be in uncomfortable situations this week
[3:33:11] shine out of them oh Father arrest them
[3:33:14] if they try to get religious
[3:33:17] if they try to get sanctimonious or
[3:33:19] legal arrest us arrest
[3:33:22] us it's not our desire to offend or to
[3:33:26] put off it's our desire to stand firm
[3:33:30] like a
[3:33:31] lighthouse and we have a tendency to go
[3:33:34] either way we're either too loose or too
[3:33:38] fanatic so we need your grace to stay in
[3:33:41] the middle of the road and keep our
[3:33:44] balance in the scripture so we ask you
[3:33:47] Lord Jesus for Grace right now we
[3:33:52] repent only you know folks what you've
[3:33:56] let
[3:33:57] in but whatever that is we we stand
[3:34:01] ready now Lord to repent and say we're
[3:34:04] sorry we have allowed
[3:34:07] things to come and take some of the room
[3:34:11] in our heart that belongs to you so
[3:34:13] today we ask for your uh true Grace to
[3:34:18] forgive us to cleanse us with the power
[3:34:21] of life and your blood and raise us up
[3:34:25] with Victory

[3:34:30] Kingdom sons of Zion
