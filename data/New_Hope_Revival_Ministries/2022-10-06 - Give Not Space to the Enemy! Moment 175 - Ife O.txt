Description:
The enemy uses the strategy of death structures built on the foundation of pain, past disappointments, and past weaknesses to abort our destiny and vision, but the Scripture admonishes us not to listen and give him any space to work on our emotions.  Our strength is God’s Word.  The Church of the Living God is built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, which is the Chief Cornerstone, the Lord Jesus Christ.
