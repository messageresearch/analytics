TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you see this is what we are supposed to be excited about not because the demons are subject to us but we're supposed to be excited because our name is written in the book Hallelujah and not a devil in hell is able to move your name oh he can slander eyesee you and criticize you and talk about you and smear your reputation down here but he cannot change the fact that your name is recorded in the deed and it was there before there was anything known about it when it was completely a secret you were there praise God before the worlds were framed before the foundations were laid your name was already on the deed because everything was sealed up in that scroll why the the world could have nearly come to an end if that scroll would have remained sealed but thanks be to God not a prophet not a pastor but the lamb prevailed wrestled with the Devil the lamb wrestled with Satan and overcame him Hallelujah so that the seals could come off of that scroll and we could understand what was going to befall what the world was going to experience but if there was nothing else in the seals except a revelation that I'm one of them that my name is there that I misses Jesus Christ and no matter what happens to this in this life though my flesh is given to the skin worms though I rot out there in a grave somewhere I know I know that I know that I know that my redeemer lives I know that he's going to stand on the earth I know that my eyes are going to see the Living God so when you feel that anxiety coming up because of the uncertainties of the world we live in right now your your shortterm future may concern you deeply but remember the one who planned your long-term future is the one that's going to walk with you through your short-term future he's going to be with his people
