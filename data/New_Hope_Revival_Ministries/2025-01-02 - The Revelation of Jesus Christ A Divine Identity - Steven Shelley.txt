Description:
In this powerful message, we delve into the prophetic revelation of Isaiah concerning our Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah. A virgin-born child, destined to be our Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, and Everlasting Father. Through John 10, we witness the moment Jesus stood in Solomon's porch, declaring His divine unity with the Father - a truth that shook the heavens and earth. When He proclaimed "I and my Father are one," He revealed the fullness of God dwelling in Him bodily. My precious friends, this revelation of Christ's identity isn't just theology - it's the very foundation of our faith and salvation. #BiblicalTruth #Jesus #Revelation #Faith

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called who is the son Jesus Yeshua our Messiah what is his name to be called wonderful counselor yes what's the next the the Mighty God is Jesus the Mighty God is Jesus the Mighty God is he the Mighty God the listen to what else he is he's not only the son he is the Everlasting father something is going to be done the prophet of the Old Testament something is going to be done that's never been done before I'm going to do something that's never happened in the earth before a virgin not just a young Maiden but a young untouched Maiden is going to Bear a child think of this and he's going to be called Yeshua Jesus for he will bring Salvation to his people it will be misunderstood but it will come it will happen at the right time at the right moment under the right conditions and the New Testament tells us in the fullness of times when time had filled up and the Earth could not go on any longer without a messiah without a savior showing up the Bible also tells us that that the world the world could not contain the Scrolls if everything that he did in his ministry was recorded now I mean to tell you what that says to me is his ministry was not only shifting things on the Earth but also all the way to the third heaven things were being moved around there's no telling what kind of confusion was caused in the second heaven where the enemy puts his throne and where his imps liked us to dwell the prince of the power of the air the scripture tells us and so in order to record everything that was happening in Earth in second heaven third heaven all the way into the throne room of God the the the world wouldn't be big enough the LI there wouldn't be a library big enough to contain but I think John 10 is one of the greatest sermons that he preached because this was the day that he decided by inspiration to tell the world who he really was he'd been hiding his true identity until this moment and In This Moment he wanted to let all all the truth out there and Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch then came the Jews round about him and said unto him how long Dost thou make us to doubt if thou be the Christ the Messiah the anointed one tell us do you ever just want to say go ahead and tell me and Jesus answered them verse 25 I told you and you believe not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because you're not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me that's right he insulted them properly and he said and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand did I just yell I did my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand so you'll never be able to get him out of mine either he's telling us and then verse 30 I and my father are one you can't worship Him in spirit and in truth if you don't know who he is the leading theologians of of our day miss it did you know what God is when you see Christ we wouldn't have known that had Jesus not answered the question by saying I and my father are one
