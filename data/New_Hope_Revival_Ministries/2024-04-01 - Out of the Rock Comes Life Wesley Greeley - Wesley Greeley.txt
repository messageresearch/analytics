the Lord would you help me to thank these very flexible [Applause] musicians Luke chap 6 verse 46 will you turn that fan off as you go off please Luke 6:46 and I would like to read through verse 49 and why call ye me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and do with them I will show you to whom he is like he is like a man which built an house and digged deep and laid the foundation on a rock and when the flood arose and the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock but but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the Earth against which the stream did beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great before you're seated First Corinthians chapter 10 1 Corinthians chap 10 verse 1-6 moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they lusted may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word let's pray before you're seated today our father how grateful we are to be gathered in the house of the Lord we thank you for each one that is gathered with us in the building we thank you for each one that may be on the other side of the camera watching this stream or who may watch it in the AR five we bless them in the name of Jesus Christ and pray now Lord that your word as it goes forth would find its place in our lives and that it would do for us what we need done at this moment I pray God that you will help your servant to get out of the way and be hid behind the cross of Calvary I pray Lord that you will speak to this your people Lord you promise that if I would open my mouth that you would fill it and so I am here on duty today and I open my mouth in your name and I ask you God that you will now speak to us I pray God that you will push back any disturbance in the spirit in the name of Jesus Christ May the angels be in their positions in this house and we will give you the glory and the honor for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we pray amen you may have your seats today I know that I have said before that it's very strange to me being a Believer and reading the word of God when I look at a scripture like we read in Luke chapter 6 and and is also found in Matthew chapter 7 this same story story is is found where Jesus is talking about those that build their house let them build it on a rock and and I remember years ago when I was just learning how to build and and we were digging along for a foundation for a footer for a home and we hit rock and it was going to be too much of a chore to try to get uh something in there to chip all the rock out and we needed to pour the concrete over the foot over the the concrete footer over the Rock and uh it it would seem according to this scripture that you would want to pour the concrete on the rock well the building inspector told us not so you cannot build you cannot pour the concrete on that rock you have to put sand over that rock before that you can pour the concrete footer and you know understanding over the years you understand that the plates of the earth move and they wanted that sand there to be a buffer for when the rock moved uh that that the the concrete would be would be able to stay in place but we have to recognize when we think about that concept of building that that is a man-made structure it is a man-made structure that the the the building inspectors uh they were able to tell us that we needed to put a little bit of sand over that rock before we poured the concrete but when we build this spiritual house this spiritual house must be built on the Rock of Ages the rock that will never move though the Earth has Rock in it when the earth shakes and the earthquakes the natural rocks may move they may bust apart they may shift they may cause us to feel afraid when the earth starts moving and shifting and shaking but when you are built on the Rock Christ Jesus he will never move he will never move if you build on this rock that we are talking about now we read in in in first Corinthians chapter 10 concerning our Brethren our fathers that were all under the cloud and they all passed through the sea and they were all baptized in the cloud and in the sea and they all ate the Same Spirit they were all alike they all were privileged to come out of Egypt do you realize when they came out of Egypt the Bible says that there was a mixed multitude UD there were all kind was not only the Israelites there was a mixed multitude and see that's what happens when there is a shakeup come on when there is a shakeup it causes people to get on board with certain things and that's what was happening in Egypt when the when when the when the death angel passed through after all of the plagues of Egypt had hit Egypt and and and it had gone through and brought Devastation to the land of Egypt there were Egyptians who said I can't handle this anymore I've got to get on board with these Israelites let's see what happens is when you have Egypt inside of you and you start going out of Egypt and they were all under the cloud all of the mix multitude was under the cloud there were all that group that went out with Moses there wasn't one of them that wasn't under the cloud they were they were privileged to be under the pillar of cloud during the day and the pillar of fire at night they had the privilege of being a part of that crowd and then when Pharaoh came up behind them and they were trapped at the Red Sea and God gave Moses the inspiration and said stretch your Rod out over the sea and the Sea split wide open all of the mixed multitude went through all of the mumbling grumbling Egyptian spirit that was under the cloud or under the pillar of fire they all went through through the Red Sea you remember when when they were stuck at the Red Sea the grumbling started you brought us out here only for us to be killed right here we got the mountains beside us we got the river in front of us we got the Egyptians behind us why did you do it Moses the grumbling started but they all went the when the Red Sea opened up they all passed over it did not matter whether they were Israelite or Egyptian or something else if they were under the cloud with Moses they were privileged to all go through that Red Sea and First Corinthian called it a baptism they were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and they did all eat the same spiritual meat they got to the other side the Egyptian Army was handled in the Red Sea God took care of them but when they got to the other side there was a rejoicing that took place when they got to the other side but the Egyptian Spirit was still in the midst of them although they were under the cloud they were under the pillar of fire and then the time came where that they started telling Moses did you bring us out here to die weren't there G uh uh uh garlic and leaks in Egypt and there was all kinds of food in Egypt at least we wouldn't have starve to death and God provided them Mana they did all eat the same spiritual meat not only the natural meat of the Mana but they were all privileged to be under the sound of the voice of the Prophet Moses when he came off of the mountain and began to talk to them right they were all under the Cloud yet there was that Egyption spirit that was prevalent among them that caused them to Grumble and Mumble and in all of this the Bible tells us in in First Corinthians as we just read that these things were our our examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted Exodus chapter 17 Exodus 17 verse one through six and all the children or all the Congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the Wilderness of sin after their Journeys according to the Commandment of the Lord and pitched in ridim and there was no water for the people to drink H wherefore the people did chide with Moses and said give us water that we may drink and Moses said unto them why ched ye with me wherefore do you tempt the Lord now I am not sure why that the word CH was used here but it seems to be uh perhaps a stronger word than just Grumble and and they were just at Moses why did you bring us out here and there's no water and and Moses Moses they came to Moses and they said give us water that we may drink and Moses said why are you chiding me and why are you tempting the Lord and the people thirsted for water and the people murmured against Moses and said wherefore is this that thou Hast brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our c battle with thirst now remember as we read this I want us to keep in mind these things are for our example to the intent that we should not lust after evil things you say wait a minute preacher water is not an evil thing we're not talking about the water we're talking about the chiding we're talking about tempting the Lord we're talking about the murmurings that were against Moses and against God all right so wherefore is it that you brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst and Moses Cried unto the Lord saying what shall I do unto this people they be almost ready to Stone me and the Lord said unto Moses go on before the people and take with thee of the Elders of Israel and thy Rod wherewith thou smortest the river take in thine hand and go behold I will stand before thee there upon the rock Horeb and thou shalt Smite The Rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and Moses did so in the sight of the Elders of Israel now the Bible explains to to us that indeed when Moses smoted the rock that God told him to take the rod the same Rod that you dipped in the Nile River and spoke over the Waters of the Nile I want you to take that rod and I want you to Smite that rock and water is going to come out of it and Moses did so and the water came out for the people to drink now Moses was being Obed obedient to the word of the Lord in the fact that he gave them water from the rock now well let me just remind you that as we read uh in in 1 Corinthians chap 10:4 they did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ the same Rock they they all drank from it they were privileged to drink from that rock all of them let me just ask you do you think that there were any of them whether they be Israelite or whether they be Egyptian or some other nationality that said I've got to get out of Egypt it's devastated I'm going with the Blessed ones do you think think that there are any of them when The Rock when The Rock gave forth its water do you think that there were any of them one that said I don't want that water no they were all thirsty they and their cattle they were thirsty they needed water now you think about how many people that there were and how many cattle that there were because you know they didn't have just their cattle attle they emptied Egypt and remember all of the first born of the cattle in Egypt were gone and perhaps the Egyptians thought we're plagued and just give it all to them get them out of here we don't want the plague anymore just get them out of here but yet when they got there and they they they realized that they needed water they began to chide Moses they began to murmur against him why did you bring us out here and now we have no water we're going to die of thirst out here in the wilderness yet Moses goes to the Lord and he says Lord these people are about ready to Stone me they want to kill me because they have no water and the lord gave him instruction to take the rod and to Smite The Rock and water came out that it could quench The Thirst of the people now their Journey continues on and we find our our our next instance concerning thirst in numbers chap 20 and we'd like to read there as well numbers chap 20: 1-13 then came the children of Israel even the whole congregation into the desert of zeen in the first month and the people Abode in cadesh and Mariam died there and was buried there and there was no water for the congregation and they gathered to themselves together against Moses and against Aaron now it's not just against Moses it's against Moses and Aaron and the people ched with Moses and spake saying would God that we had died when our Brethren died before the Lord now what is it with usens what is it with people all through their Journey they found something new to Grumble about and we as people have not changed much since 4,000 years and we we can have a we can have a wonderful time in the Lord but then when we meet the enemy face to face then we find our grumbling heart again God help us now we're talking about the children of Israel all who came through the Red Sea now obviously there are new children that are being born there's new generation Rising in up but here are a group of people that now find themselves once again thirsty no water they gather themselves against Moses and Aaron they ched Moses and say would God that we had died in the wilderness with our brother now what kind of a heart what kind of an attitude what kind of a spirit would be in us that we would would all of the sudden and we we're a part of a a beautiful Congregation of people out in the wilderness God has sustained us he's given us Mana from Heaven he's given us meat to eat and water to drink and he's done all of this for us we've seen the miraculous works of God when when uh Kora he he decided that he he wanted to be uh head hono and Moses wasn't doing things right and God came along and said that all right you know we're we're going to we're going to have a showdown here and the Earth swallowed Kora up and was that what was in mind with these guys would God that we had died when our Brethren died before the Lord what kind of an attitude is this that we would that they would say you know I I'm thirsty and I I wish that I had just died when our brothers died before the Lord then I wouldn't have to worry about thirst anymore want you to watch most of you are familiar with this let's just watch again God gives instruction take the rod and gather the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so that thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts to drink and Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he commanded him and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the Rock and he said unto them here now you rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock Moses had had it Pastor Moses had had it he was tired of their mumbling and grumbling and it got to him listen friends this is why we need the Holy Ghost so desperately in this hour because the enemy wants you to have it and he wants you to respond in a wrong attitude to keep you out of the promise of God and Moses says here now you rebels must we fetch you water out of the Rock and Moses lifted up his hand and with his Rod he smoted it smote The Rock twice what did God say to do with it speak to the Rock what did Moses do he spoke to the congregation out of frustration rather than speaking to the rock with the word of the Lord he spoke to the congregation out of frustration and his frustration Rose to the level that had got out of hand and rather than speaking to the Rock he took the rod that brought water from the rock the first time and he smoke the rock twice and water still came out oh for the grace of God in our ignorance in our frustration in our stupidity oh for the grace of God that covers our behind because even though he was disobedient to the word of the Lord and he took the rod and he smoted it twice the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also and the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron because you believed me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them this is the water of marah because the children of Israel strove with the Lord and he was Sanctified in them now you just think about this situation brother random taught us that he threw the plan of God out of catar in when he smote The Rock twice because the the the rock Christ Jesus was only supposed to be smitten one time now because of the grace of God Moses uh when he was frustrated with the people the water still came came out of the rock though he was disobedient but the Bible tells us that Moses was not able to go and take the people into the promised land now remember God gave Moses such an opportunity when he took him up to the top of the mountain and he let him look over into the promised land but I want you to know that Moses did not lose out with the Lord right he lost out in taking the people into the promised land but he didn't lose out with the Lord why because Moses followed that rock Moses he would he recognized that there was a Grace that was sufficient for him in so much that his time went by and Christ when he appeared on Mount Transfiguration who was with him Moses and Elijah there he was right there on top of the mountain he may not have been able to lead the children of Israel into the promised land the way he wanted to but he got to the promised land the promised land was his because of the grace of God now I want to read from Deuteronomy chapter 32 and I'm going to do some skipping so I'll try to keep you posted about what I'm reading Deuteronomy 32: 1-4 give ear oh you heavens and I will speak and hear oh Earth the words of my mouth my Doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distill as the Dew as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon the grass because I will publish the name of the Lord ascribe ye to the greatness unto our God verse four he is the rock his work is perfect for all his ways are judgment a god of Truth and without an iniquity just and right is he verse nine for the Lord's portion is his people Jacob is the lot of his in inheritance he found him in a desert land and in the waste howling Wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye as the eagle stirreth up her nest flutter over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her wings so the Lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him he made him ride on the high place places of the earth that he might eat the increase of the fields he made him to suck honey out of the Rock and out and oil out of the flinty rock now uh I didn't say it at the beginning but I taken for a thought today out of the Rock and we see that we've already read about this rock that followed them through the Wilderness how that they got water when Moses smoted it the first time and he was instructed and we see here that that uh again he they needed water and Moses was told to speak to the Rock yet Moses took the rod and he smokee it twice and water still came out of the rock because God was going to cover for Moses the grace of God who covers for us and now we're reading here Moses's song of Thanksgiving and he's saying that he made him to suck honey out of of The Rock and oil out of the flinty rock now I don't know the story of them sucking honey out of the rock I can't find it but it must have happened not only did water come out of a rock honey came out of a rock now I threw the message of the hour I've heard brother brandham talk about that that there was a crevice in the Rock and that a bee found that crevice in the Rock and that they began to build a a nest there and that they made a honeycomb a hive in that place and that it created a place for them to eat honey from The Rock I don't know but I can see here in the scripture that Moses is giving thanks and he said he made him to suck honey out of the rock so I'll just take it that somewhere there was a rock and I'm still saying that out of that rock Christ Jesus although that Moses at the time did not have a name to put on him as we do Lord Jesus Christ there was something inside of Moses that he knew where his sustenance came from his sustenance came out of the rock out of the rock flowed water to sustain the people the first time when he smoted it and out of the W Rock came water the second time when he smoted it twice and apparently there was honey that come out of the Rock and there was oil that came out of the flinty rock we also read in Psalm 81:16 he should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee then I remind you of the story that we heard heard so many times when brother Brenham was talking about the sheep and how that they would become sickly and there was something in the Limestone rock that they needed but you couldn't get them to just go lick a rock and so the shepherd would carry honey in his scrip bag and when he recognized that his sheep was ailing and that that sheep needed to get the Limestone that was in that rock that that Shepherd would get some honey out of the script bag and rub it into the Rock and the the the the Sheep would come and start licking the honey the healing was not necessarily in the honey but the healing was in the rock out of the rock came the healing that the Sheep needed and so the shepherd would rub Honey in the Rock something sweet reminds me of the word of God it's sweet in the mouth but it's bitter in the belly but there's something about the word of God that it there's a sweetness to it and it draws us to it because the Holy Ghost knows what we need he knows the word that we need in due season so he puts it out there with a Sweetness in it and we take and we eat it and after a while we recognize this ain't as sweet as I thought it was and it starts churning inside of us because it's working because we got to the Rock the honey got us to the Rock Christ Jesus and we still we went to licking the rock we went to to getting something out of the rock that was really going to sustain us because the sweetness will wear off in a hurry but the SI the the the sustenance that we need from the word of God it goes down and it starts ruminating it starts guring and and going about in our gut and we don't know hardly what to do with it but it's working it's working to bring forth the Manifest glory of God in our life it's working in me both to Will and to do of his good pleasure because I am his I belong to him and I am come I'm coming as a son I'm coming into my maturity and I'm not just going to spit out everything it's a joy to watch my granddaughter you know there are some that hate vegetables some vegetables are bitter but there's nutrition in them and there's sometimes when you feed a child there's some adults too they just it's green they don't touch it you know but a child sometimes a new experience you put it in their mouth and they don't like the taste and they'll spit it out but yesterday Edith was sitting at my table and we had chicken and we had butternut squash which is very sweet and very pleasant to look at it's orange and she likes that very much much but also on the table was zucchini squash roasted zucchini squash which happens to be green and it's not as pleasant to look at as the butternut squash yet it has nutrition in it that can help us if we'll eat it and so I just reached over and I put my Fork she was feeding herself but I decided let's see if she'll try this and I stuck the zucchini in her mouth and she chewed it up she did not frown she did not make a sour face but she chewed it up and she swallowed it because her mom and dad are teaching her you got to try things and that's the way it is with the word of God there are sometimes in time past where we have spit it out we've spit it out because we didn't like it with where we were at the moment but because of the grace of God and because that we belong to him he and his Mercy will'll bring zucchini back around [Music] again now there are some that like turnup in the I guess you would call it the fruit whatever it is is the root and there are some that like the leaves quite frankly I'm not fond of either one of them yet there are times if you give me the leaves and enough hot pepper sauce I'll eat the leaves and there are times when you get a a turnup root that is cut up and boiled and has enough butter on it and salt and pepper and and that it's not too bitter that I like it okay and I'll eat it because I have been taught that that there is nutrition in some of these things and and even though I have tasted bitter turnup and when I was younger I never understood why my dad wanted a turnup every now and then there's you know it's it's just bitter why do you want that and that's the way it is with the word of God there are times where that we uh in our in our moment of Life something is fed to us and it's bitter to us and we've got to go through another Wilderness we've got to go through another trial we've got to come we've got to go through another test to bring us up to a level of maturity where that we're not spitting out the turnup or the zucchini we're not spitting out the word of God but we are taking it because we know that it has nutrition that we need for our maturity and so we then eat it and yes it isn't always sweet in the mouth we talk about the word of God being sweet in the mouth and there are many many times that there the that the word of God is sweet in our mouth and then bitter in the belly but I'm just going to tell you from experience there have been plenty of times that the word of God came to me and it was just as bitter as the last time but I was at a different place with a more receptive heart to recognize that it was still a pill that I needed to swallow and let it become nutrition inside of me and do its work give me a glass of water I'll wash it on down let me get in the presence of the Lord and let the water from the rock come and bathe over my soul and refill me with the Holy Ghost to let me know that even though the word was was bitter and I took it in and I swallowed it it didn't it didn't taste so good at the moment but I realize it's something that I really need I can sit and keep saying nope don't want any no don't want any no I don't want that after a while the Lord let you know that you belong to him and you can say no no no no but after a while you recognize that the fool have said in his heart no I know the King James says the fool has said in her heart there is no God but there are even fools that knows there's God but there have been many of foolish Christians along the way and many of foolish unbelievers along the way who when God gave them instruction they did a very foolish thing and and they said no thank you Lord and some were even as foolish enough to say no way God but after a while because of his grace for a while he covers our backside but after a while he said it's time to come up a little bit higher it's time to put aside childish things and quit speak out the zucchini it's time to take this pill and swallow it because you must grow up into a mature son so he puts the honey on the Rock and he says you got to get to it you got to get to it reading on verse 14 butter of kind and milk of sheep with fat of lambs and Rams of the breed of Bashan and goats with the fat of kidneys of Wheat and thou D drink the pure blood of the grape but Jerin waxed fat this is also another name for Jacob or Israel jesan waxed fat and kicked Thou Art wax and fat I'm reading in Deuteronomy 32 I'm sorry Deuteronomy 32 now I'm in verse 16 they provoked him to jealousy with strin Gods with Abominations provoked they him to anger they sacrificed unto devils not to God to Gods whom they knew not to New Gods they came that came newly up whom your fathers feared not of the rock that begat thee Thou Art unmindful and H has forgotten God that formed thee verse 30 how should one chase a thousand and two put 10,000 to flight except their Rock had sold them and the Lord had shut them up for their rock is not as our Rock even our enemies themselves being judges now this is one of those verses that we preachers misquote verse 30 and we talk about if one can put a thousand to flight and then two can put 10,000 to flight and we've misquoted the scripture now I I'm going to say that what we have said is true because God is on my side and I can't do anything in myself and how can one put a thousand or two 10,000 to flight except their rocket sold them you see the children of Israel got themselves in a bind because they forgot the rock they forgot that they got water out of that rock again and again and they got honey from that rock and they got sustenance from that rock but they got themselves into a place and God shut them up the rock sold them and the Lord shut them up therefore one could chase a th000 and two could put 10,000 to flight because of the rock they were no longer Mindful and they had forgotten God that formed them God squeezed them into a position where that he could get their attention again so you have God there Rock allowing one to chase a th and two to put 10,000 now I want you to understand God is God and he knows how to turn that around he knows how to help us when we are chasing the enemy because my rock knows how to shut up the enemy just like he knows how to shut me up that's right all right my rock out of the Rock out of the rock out of the rock they got water out of the rock they got honey out of The Rock was their sustenance now we read uh in the continue reading in the Old Testament about Hannah her song of Thanksgiving in 1st Samuel chap 2 veres 1 and two Hannah prayed and said my heart rejoices in the Lord mine horn is exalted in the Lord my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies because I rejoice in thy salvation there is none holy as the Lord for there is none beside thee neither is there any Rock like our God now we know the story of Hannah Hannah wanted a son and she went to the temple and and she prayed and the Eli thought she was drunk and and uh she said no I'm not drunk I'm just of a sorrowful heart and and Eli then blessed her and said be it as you have prayed and God answered answered the prayer and gave her a son Samuel and here she is giving the Lord thanks there is none holy as the Lord there is none beside thee neither is there any Rock like our God then we read in 2 Samuel CH 22: 1-4 we read that David is giving Thanksgiving after God delivered him from his enemies David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord had delivered him out of the hands of all of his enemies and out of the hand of Saul and he said the Lord is my rock and my Fortress my deliverer the god of my rock in him will I trust he is my shield and the Horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge My Savior thou savest me from violence I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from mine enemies verse 31 of the same chapter as for God his ways are perfect the word of the Lord is tried he is a buckler to all them that trust him for who is God save the Lord and who is a rock Save Our God God is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect he maketh my feet like hind feet and sth me upon my high places now we are remembering as we read this verse once again that this is the year of mountain climbing and we've got to keep our balance in the scriptures and we've got to stay in the middle of the road and we've got to praise until the spirit of worship comes and we've got to worship until the glory comes and we've got to stand in the glory when it comes then we've got to learn to love and then my son whatever you do make sure you have the anointing don't try to do it without the anointing friends we've got to have the anointing it's the only way that we are going to be able to climb in these high places he maketh my feet like sign's feet and Seth me upon my high places the Lord liveth verse 47 and blessed be my Rock and exalted be the god of the rock of my salvation you can also read this in Psalm chapter 18 then we have we can find in the scripture that this same Rock became a rock of offense we find it in Isaiah 8:14 we find it in Romans 9:33 and also I want to read from 1 Peter 2 verse 6-8 where wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders are disallowed the same is made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed now you've got to remember that it was prophesied that he would become a rock of offense that he would be a stone of stumbling yet that same stone that would cause others to stumble that same Rock would be the one that we would get our sustenance from it would be the same Rock the same the same stone that was cut out of the mountain without hands that's coming to the elect lady with Grace Grace unto it C shouts of Grace Grace and we've been hearing this uh the stature of the perfect man and the capping Stone of Love which comes by way of the Holy Ghost it is being poured out on us this Stone this rock of offense to some is precious to me and so Jesus he is recognizing all this is happening and so we come up to Matthew chapter 16 when they're at cesaria Philippi and he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some of you some say that you're John the Baptist and some say Elias and others jeremias or one of the prophets this is Matthew chapter 16 verse 15 he says unto them but whom do you say that I am and Son see it had become an offense to people The Rock Christ Jesus had become an offense to people and so Jesus is asking them who do you say well some say this and some say that and some say you're John the Baptist and some say you're Elias and some say you know you you are one of the prophets maybe Jeremiah but he says I ain't worried about what everybody else is saying I want to know what you say and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered unto him and said blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock will I build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it now this is not a church this is a revelation of who Jesus Christ is and Peter when he was asked Jesus said I don't want to know what everybody else is thinking they're out there I want to know what you're thinking I want to know what you've got to say about it you've walked with me now for quite some time I'm coming to the end of my journey he's already been trying to tell them uh the son of man's got to go and he's got to be in the heart of the Earth for three days and three nights even as Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights so now he's he's he's been telling them this and he's asking them who do you say I've been walking with you you've been walking with me who are you going to say that I am and he says Peter says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and then Jesus tells him Upon This Rock of Revelation I'm going to build my church you must know who the Lord Jesus Christ is you have to know who he is flesh and blood and didn't reveal it to you but my Father which is in heaven and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I'm going to give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on the Earth shall be loosed in heaven then he charged his disciples that he should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ now I'm going to go on here because I I want you to see something Peter has just from his mouth spoken this great Revelation the Revelation that Jesus is the Christ the anointed the Messiah and Jesus tells him upon that Revelation I'm going to build my church and I'm going to give you the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatever you loose on Earth will be loosed in heaven and so uh from that time fourth began Jesus to show to his disciples how he must go up to Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day then Peter the same guy that got the Revelation the same guy that had the got the keys to the kingdom that Peter took him and began to rebuke him and saying be it far from thee Lord this shall not be done unto thee then he turned and said to Peter get thee behind me Satan Thou Art an offense to me for thou savest not the things that be of God but those that be of men now I want you to notice that Peter received a great Revelation and turned right around and was able ble to say to him no those things aren't going to happen no come on Jesus come on you got to quit talking dark like that you you got to quit telling us these dark things everything's going to be all right now Jesus already knew what he was going to have to face he already knew it and now he's telling Peter he he's saying to Peter get thee behind me Satan he was not calling Peter Satan but the words that were coming out of Peter's mouth were an offense to him they were something that was trying to bring a stumbling to the Lord Jesus Christ to cause the flesh that he walked in to become weaker or weakened so that he would not fulfill what he had come to the Earth for words that came out of Peter's mouth as we talked on Wednesday or Tuesday night how that they are a weapon against us words that came out of Peter's mouth and Jesus said Satan get behind me so just so you know as we mature if you should say something as foolish as Peter was saying to one of us and we turn around and say Satan get thee behind me we're taking authority over the weapon that was formed amen because we recognize that there are certain things that come to our life for our life for our maturity Christ The Mystery of God revealed and now the church or now the Christ in the church is just being made known the whole thing is the revelation of God to take Eve back to her right position again with her husband notice and God is in is the husband of the church and the church is his bride now Peter when he called said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God now watch blessed are you Simon bar Jonah says which me means son of Jonas see blessed are you for Flesh and Blood never revealed this to you you never learned it from from from some school but my Father which is in heaven has revealed it to you notice what he said to him Upon This Rock that's Peter the predestinated seat of God that had received this light and given the keys to the kingdom Upon This Rock of revelation of who Jesus Christ is he is the full manifested God not a father Son and Holy Ghost and him being the second person Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall never shake it down never Prevail against it see I'll build my church on this rock a revelation of Jesus Christ look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the Revelation see Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole things see see what God is trying to do what is the new birth you'd say well brother randam what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen see not you joined a church you shook a hand you done something different you set a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the Revelation that Christ was built P now interestingly enough everywhere you look in the church world it's Easter Sunday first time I've mentioned that word today now I am not sure how from 3:00 Friday afternoon to Sunrise Sunday morning is three days and three nights and I know what brother brandham said so you don't have to throw a rock at me because quite frankly I just want to say today that that is not not enough for me to knock down and drag out over because all that matters to me today is that he's resurrected he's alive and he's living inside of me now this year is different from most years in that Easter weekend and Passover are not even in the same month Passover is not until April the 20th maybe something of that nature the end the end of April a month away Passover and when Jesus was taken to the cross at the we call it the passion week the time leading up to the cross when he was taken to the Cross you remember he had one last supper with his disciples and that last supper was a Passover seder and he said I'll not drink this cup anymore with you until I drink it a new in the Kingdom with you and he one last time he had this supper with his disciples and so this was during the Passover time it was the time time when Jerusalem was very crowded when all of the disciples uh not just the disciples but all of the the uh the men of Israel were to come up to Jerusalem they were to come to Jerusalem three times a year they were to come at Passover time at Pentecost and also at the Feast of Tabernacles in the fall that was the three feasts of the Lord that they were to come up to uh to Jerusalem for and so this would have been a very crowded time uh during during the Feast of Passover not necessarily Easter weekend as we call it so we we know that that the church world has made it very very Pagan uh because they pulled from uh a pagan Society to be able to add to it I I find it very interesting that uh the more you make it Pagan the more it becomes Pagan to the point that our president uh he he acknowledged that this was the the that it was uh going to be the visibility of transgenderism on this day and so as as as it becomes more Pagan it becomes more Pagan and and so we as the body of Christ are not partaking of uh of of the celebration of the rabbits and the eggs and and all of this fertility goddess and and all that is surrounded of what they call Easter but we do partake of the Resurrection The the death burial and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ because had he not come in the flesh we would not we would still be under the under the blood of bulls and goats and the blood of bulls and goats could never cleanse us from our sin it could never bring the reconciliation that we needed uh in the separation that we had from our creator that blood could never bring us or reconcile us back to the Rock Christ Jesus it could never reconcile us yet when he came the Lord Jesus he came as a baby he was born he was not born on December the 25th but he was born and he walked on the earth for 33 and a half years and he was not crucified on Easter weekend but he was crucified he laid down his life for me he laid down his life that I could have life and have it more abundantly but if he had stayed in the grave he would have been like every other man and we would not be standing here talking about a messiah who died and was resurrected now we see that in all of the accounts when they took Jesus and they crucified him they took him and he put him on the hill of golgatha and they nailed him to a cross an execution stake and he was not the only one that was executed that day we sang before the word about even in death he remembered the thief hanging on the cross he wasn't the only Thief there was another one on the other side that was railing against him if you be the Son of God why don't you get us all down off of the crosses the other one recognized this is the same Rock that the children of Israel got water from in the wilderness this is the same rock that gave them honey that gave them sustenance this is the same Rock and his answer to them to Jesus was remember me when you come into your paradise and Jesus so graciously offered it to him now when his death was complete Matthew CH 27: 57-61 when the even was come there came a rich man of ARA named Joseph who also himself was Jesus's disciple he went to pilate and he B beg the body of Jesus then pilate commanded the body to be delivered and when Joseph had taken the body he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and laid it in his own tomb which he had heun out in the Rock and he rolled a great Stone to the door of the Seiler and departed and there was Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sitting over against the Seiler now I as I was pondering out of the rock came water and out of the rock came honey and then I started thinking about where he was laid was Hune a tomb that was heun out of the Rock and I thought out of the rock came the rock out of the rock came The Rock in the end of the Sabbath it began to Dawn toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene this is Matthew 28: 1-8 Mary Magdalene and the others to to the separer and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descend Ed from heaven and came and rolled back the Stone from the door and sat upon it now I would like to point out that it was the end of the Sabbath and it began to Dawn toward the first day of the week and Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to the SRE and there was a great earthquake and the stone was rolled back for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it and his countenance was like lightning his rment white as snow and for fear of the keepers did shake and became as dead men and the angel answered and said to the woman fear not for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified he isn't here and it I I I don't guess that it ever occurred to me before that it was not necessary for the stone to be rolled back for Jesus to get out of that tomb there was an earthquake and the stone got rolled back because there was somebody coming to check on Jesus they were bringing spices after the Sabbath it's very early in the morning other gospels record this at the dawning of the Sun but Jesus was already risen so we in the church World in time pass came up with this idea to have an Easter Sunrise Service just like the pagans we need to read it Ezekiel Ezekiel chapter 8 the hand of the Lord is on Ezekiel and he is brought to the court of the house of the Lord verse 14 he brought me to the door of the Gate of the Lord's House which was toward the North and behold there were there were women weeping for tamuz then said he unto me have you seen this oh son of man turn yet again and you shall see greater Abominations than these and he brought me into the inner Court of the Lord's House and behold at the door of the Temple of the Lord between the porch and the altar were about five and 20 men with their backs toward the Temple of the Lord and their faces toward the East and they worship the son toward the east then he said unto me have you seen this oh son of man is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the Abominations which they commit here for they have filled the land with violence and have returned to provoke me to anger and L they put the branch in their nose therefore will I also deal in Fury mine eyes shall not spare neither will I have pity and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice yet will I not hear them now once again if that's what you want to do that's for you to do I'm glad as my wife says I'm glad in my spirit and I'm glad in my flesh that we left that behind am anybody remember those cold mornings out here just at the rising of the sun it was so cold the sun came up you didn't want to be out of bed that early yeah we remember but we do know that Jesus Christ was laid in the Tomb and he did rise he was laid in a rock but he did not have to have the stone rolled back to come out of there and he today is not in a tomb he is out of that rock came The Rock The Rock The Rock Christ Jesus and I stand here today letting you know that there is still water in the rock there is still Honey in the Rock out of the rock came water for the children of Israel out of the rock came honey for the children of Israel but out of that same Rock there is still coming water there is still coming Revelation there is still coming truths that transform us the rock Christ Jesus is alive today and he is still giving us water from that rock if the spirit Romans 8:11 if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you because that he did not want us to be wandering around as empty vessels he didn't want us to be ragd dolls he wanted us to
