[0:00] oh
[0:05] [Music]
[0:18] [Music]
[0:37] you're watching the Eagles cry I'm
[0:40] Pastor Steven Shelly and I want to
[0:42] welcome you to the broadcast today we're
[0:45] in the middle of a study series on the
[0:48] spirit and power of Elijah past present
[0:51] and future and we're learning so many
[0:54] things about the character the the
[0:57] attributes uh even the demonstr ations
[1:00] of the power of God in the life of
[1:02] Elijah the prophet and the reason why
[1:05] we're studying it is because the
[1:07] scripture has promised that this spirit
[1:09] will return this power this anointing
[1:12] will return to the earth a number of
[1:15] times we also believe that in this
[1:19] generation it's getting time for the
[1:21] spirit and power of Elijah that same
[1:24] kind of raw anointing to fall on the
[1:27] lives of a Remnant body of believers so
[1:30] that we can rise up and see the work of
[1:33] the Kingdom forwarded in a mighty way we
[1:37] want to see the works of the enemy
[1:39] exposed and his influence over many many
[1:42] lives broken and we want to see the
[1:45] kingdom of God established in the hearts
[1:47] of men and women in every nation of the
[1:50] world does that seem like an impossible
[1:52] task well it will if your only source of
[1:55] inspiration is the daily news but if
[1:58] your source of inspiration is like mine
[2:01] from the word of God from the quickening
[2:03] of the spirit of God then you'll
[2:06] understand that the darker it gets out
[2:08] there the brighter it must become in the
[2:11] life of every believer and that is
[2:14] possible if we keep our minds and our
[2:17] lives focused on the Lord you know you
[2:20] often become like what you focus on what
[2:24] you gaze on and so I encourage you to
[2:27] turn your heart your attention full
[2:30] attention to the word of God to the
[2:33] mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:35] look at him and live do you remember
[2:38] those children of Israel when they were
[2:41] were stricken by a plague of serpents
[2:43] and they began to bite them and the word
[2:45] of the Lord came and to Moses to put up
[2:48] a brass serpent on a pole and all that
[2:51] looked upon Him shall live the Bible
[2:53] tells us in the Gospel of John in the
[2:55] same manner that that serpent was raised
[2:58] up even our Lord Jesus was raised up on
[3:01] the cross on the on the execution Pole
[3:04] or stake and those who look upon him can
[3:08] live and the plague can be stopped in
[3:11] your life so I encourage you to look to
[3:14] Jesus and live turn your back on false
[3:18] religion turn your back on on the mere
[3:21] traditions and fables of men and believe
[3:25] the god of the Bible he is a real God
[3:29] and he wants to bring deliverance and
[3:31] help in your life now don't you hold on
[3:33] to the god of your childhood and the god
[3:36] of the Bible at the same time you've got
[3:38] to be willing to reject the god that
[3:42] only exists in the minds of men and
[3:44] women and find faith in the god of the
[3:48] Bible Jehovah God the god of the Old
[3:52] Testament and the New Testament The God
[3:54] Who so loved this world that He Sent His
[3:58] only begotten son in fact the Bible said
[4:02] in John 1:1 the word in the beginning
[4:05] was the word and the Word was with God
[4:08] and the Word was God and the word became
[4:12] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[4:15] his glory the glory as of the only
[4:18] begotten of the father full of grace and
[4:20] truth and this is the love story that
[4:23] God loved you so much that he came to
[4:26] this earth in the likeness of sinful
[4:28] flesh so that he could walk in your
[4:31] shoes so to speak he could understand
[4:34] the the trials and pains of living in
[4:37] this present world living in a real
[4:40] world where where Satan is the prince of
[4:42] the power of the air our Lord did that
[4:45] as our example and today he lives and to
[4:49] make intercession for us before the
[4:52] father he is our great high priest and
[4:55] we we know that according to the
[4:57] scripture he he fulfills that role
[5:00] because of his Earthly walk because he
[5:03] walked here on the earth and the
[5:05] scripture says that he is moved he is
[5:09] touched with the feeling of our
[5:12] infirmities that means he knows what
[5:14] you're going through and loves you and
[5:17] wants to bring help and hope and
[5:20] deliverance in your life if you'll just
[5:22] open up your heart and let him we're
[5:24] talking about the characteristics of the
[5:27] Prophet Elijah so that we can help
[5:30] identify that spirit and power of Elijah
[5:34] in past generations and moving forward
[5:37] we want to know that when that Spirit of
[5:40] Elijah and that power of Elijah comes
[5:42] into the Earth lest the Earth be smitten
[5:45] with a curse Malachi 4:5 and6 tells us
[5:49] we want to be able to recognize it to
[5:51] identify with that spirit and power and
[5:54] even cooperate with it with our lives
[5:57] we've been talking about on the last
[5:59] broadcast how that Elijah was called by
[6:02] God equipped by God to confront the
[6:06] spirit of Jezebel which is a spirit of
[6:09] manipulation and control we read in the
[6:13] scripture that Ahab was already Wicked
[6:15] in his heart as the king of Israel but
[6:19] that that wickedness just magnified it
[6:22] became even more effective over the
[6:25] nation when he married Jezebel the name
[6:28] Jezebel is a Phoenician name in origin
[6:32] and it means
[6:59] her lack of submission and her
[7:02] infidelities proved that true marriage
[7:05] meant nothing to her you see to Jezebel
[7:08] marriage was just a way to advance her
[7:12] agenda it was a way to control the
[7:14] nation using King Ahab her husband as
[7:19] the tool to carry out her own plans
[7:24] thoughts and agendas for the nation she
[7:27] was advancing the worst worship of the
[7:30] god bael and she was using Ahab to get
[7:34] it done this is how the spirit of
[7:37] Jezebel works today in the government of
[7:41] Nations around the world and this is
[7:44] also how the spirit of Jezebel seeks to
[7:47] control the Church of the Living God by
[7:51] manipulating and controlling legitimate
[7:54] leadership until this leadership becomes
[7:58] corrupted and perverted
[8:00] and then it is no longer genuine in the
[8:02] sight of God but only a a veil of
[8:05] deception that causes people to go
[8:08] further and further away from
[8:10] righteousness and Holiness no wonder we
[8:14] say we need a move of God in the in this
[8:16] hour we do need a move of God we need
[8:19] Elijah to rise up we need men and women
[8:23] with the spirit and power of Elijah who
[8:25] are not afraid of that Spirit of Jezebel
[8:28] men and women who can go down on their
[8:30] knees in war this is how we fight we
[8:33] fight on our knees if we want to see the
[8:36] spirit of Jezebel and her influence
[8:39] broken in our nation we go down on our
[8:42] knees if we want to see our churches
[8:45] cleaned out of that Spirit of control
[8:48] and manipulation that Jezebel brings we
[8:51] go down on our knees and that's where we
[8:54] win this battle I like the fact that
[8:56] there's power in prayer and that God god
[9:00] Jehovah is still on the throne he's
[9:02] still winning battles now in fact
[9:05] Jezebel's name meant un cohabitation or
[9:09] no cohabitation Jezebel would not
[9:12] cohabit that means she wouldn't dwell
[9:15] with a partner as partners she wanted to
[9:18] be in control her weapons were many
[9:23] seduction coercion manipulation
[9:27] humiliation deception flattery slander
[9:32] whatever was necessary to take control
[9:35] of every situation that's what Jezebel
[9:39] would
[9:40] use Jezebel's treachery toward an
[9:44] innocent and righteous man whose name
[9:47] was naboth marked the beginning of the
[9:50] end for her and King Ahab many of us
[9:54] know that story why don't I just turn
[9:56] over here and read just a portion of
[9:59] that to you in first Kings CH 21 verse 1
[10:04] and it came to pass after these things
[10:06] that naboth the jezreelite had a
[10:09] Vineyard which was in jezrael hard by
[10:12] the Palace of Ahab king of Samaria and
[10:14] Ahab spake unto naboth saying give me
[10:18] that Vineyard that I may have it as a
[10:20] garden of herbs because it is near unto
[10:24] my house and I will give thee for it a
[10:26] better Vineyard than it or if it seem
[10:30] Good To Thee I will give Thee the worth
[10:32] of it in money in other words I'll
[10:34] either trade you a parcel of land or
[10:37] I'll pay you a fair price for it and
[10:40] naboth oh my naboth said to Ahab the
[10:45] king the Lord forbid it me that I should
[10:50] give the inheritance of my fathers unto
[10:54] thee do don't you like the courage and
[10:58] the Integrity of naboth he stood up this
[11:02] wasn't the king's servant he was
[11:04] standing up to this was the king himself
[11:08] he said the Lord will not allow me to
[11:11] take my inheritance and give it to you
[11:15] now nabo was not only a man of strong
[11:19] conviction who valued his inheritance he
[11:22] also understood that according to the
[11:25] Torah the instructions of God to the
[11:28] children of Israel that it was forbidden
[11:33] for him to devalue his inheritance in
[11:36] this manner and give it to another one
[11:38] and so naboth was not just standing up
[11:41] for his own personal convictions he was
[11:44] also standing up for the instruction of
[11:47] God's word I like that I like that I
[11:51] appreciate the courage of of naboth God
[11:54] give me that kind of Courage that I can
[11:57] say to this world I'm not for sale what
[12:00] God has given me as my inheritance is
[12:03] not for sale we ought to rise up in the
[12:06] spirit wherever you are right now
[12:08] watching this and say to the enemy of
[12:11] our soul I am not for sale my family my
[12:16] children my church my community my
[12:19] nation is not for sale God forbid you
[12:23] old devil that I would give my
[12:25] inheritance into your hands I'll Stand
[12:29] and and defend that which God has
[12:31] invested in my life verse four said and
[12:35] Ahab came into his house heavy and
[12:38] displeased oh poor Ahab because of the
[12:43] word which naboth the jezreelite had
[12:46] spoken to him for he had said I will not
[12:49] give Thee the inheritance of my fathers
[12:52] and he laid him down upon his bed and
[12:55] turned away and would eat no bread now
[12:58] does doesn't that sound like a pouting
[13:00] child here is the king of the Northern
[13:03] Kingdom of Israel and he's pouting like
[13:06] a little two-year-old but that's all
[13:08] right because that's exactly the kind of
[13:11] situation that Jezebel was waiting on so
[13:14] that she could slip in and use her power
[13:18] of manipulation and control verse five
[13:21] shows us that but Jezebel his wife came
[13:24] to him and said unto him why is thy
[13:27] can't you just hear her why is your
[13:30] spirit so sad uh sweetheart that you
[13:33] would eat no bread real sympathy not
[13:37] really just put on and he said unto her
[13:41] because I spake unto nabbo the jesrael
[13:44] and told him said unto him give me thy
[13:46] Vineyard for money uh and she he
[13:48] describes the deal that he offered and
[13:51] verse 7 said and Jezebel his wife said
[13:53] unto him Dost thou now govern the
[13:55] Kingdom of Israel in other words aren't
[13:57] you the king aren't you the one in
[14:00] control arise and eat bread let me fix
[14:03] you a little snack honey Dost thou now
[14:06] govern the kingdom arise and eat bread
[14:08] and let thine heart be merry listen to
[14:11] what she says I will give Thee the
[14:14] vineyard of naboth the jezreelite here
[14:17] how that Spirit Works she took advantage
[14:20] of this pouty husband she stepped right
[14:23] in and said I will give you how is she
[14:26] going to give it was it hers was it in
[14:28] her power could she just take it away
[14:31] from him I want you to know she was
[14:33] powerless without the pen of Ahab
[14:37] without the surrendered authority of
[14:39] Ahab if he hadn't been so weak and so
[14:42] much like what sometimes we say like a
[14:45] noodle you you know how how a noodle
[14:48] when you boil it it it first it starts
[14:50] off really stiff and you boil it in
[14:53] water and it becomes all soft and this
[14:55] is how Ahab was he was like a spaghetti
[14:58] noodle and this is just exactly what
[15:01] what uh Jezebel needed to step in and
[15:04] start working her dirty work and so what
[15:07] she did was she wrote letters in ahab's
[15:11] name do you understand she didn't have
[15:14] enough Authority on her own so she had
[15:17] to find another authority to work
[15:20] through namely the authority of Ahab you
[15:23] better watch that Spirit of Jezebel it's
[15:26] alive today it's in the world world
[15:29] today it's in our governments and
[15:31] Nations today it's in our churches today
[15:34] we need Elijah to rise up who'll pray
[15:37] against that Spirit of Jezebel so she
[15:40] gets out and she starts writing letters
[15:43] in ahab's name and she takes his seal
[15:46] see illegitimate Authority she takes his
[15:50] seal and uses it to seal those letters
[15:53] and sent them to the elders and Nobles
[15:56] in the city dwelling around nabbo and
[15:58] wrote WR him these letters saying
[16:00] proclaim a fast and set naboth on high
[16:03] among the people see she's going to lift
[16:05] him up so she can rip him down and it
[16:07] goes on that a fast was declared and it
[16:11] goes on that there came in two men
[16:13] children of bile and sat before him and
[16:16] the men of B witnessed against him even
[16:18] against nabo she found people who would
[16:21] lie against naboth a servant of God in
[16:25] the presence of the people accusing
[16:27] naboth of blasphemy fing the Lord and
[16:30] the King Then They Carried him forth out
[16:32] of the city and stoned him with stones
[16:36] until he died nabbo murdered because
[16:40] Ahab wanted a herb garden I want you to
[16:43] know wicked things like that happen in
[16:46] the world that we live in today and as
[16:49] long as Jezebel's Spirit goes
[16:52] unconfronted these things will continue
[16:54] to happen in church families in church
[16:57] assemblies all over over the world
[17:00] righteous men dying by the wayside
[17:03] paying the price so that Jezebel can uh
[17:07] you know keep Ahab happy so that when
[17:10] she wants to advance her agenda she can
[17:13] keep using his seal and signing letters
[17:15] in his name they sent word to Jezebel in
[17:19] verse 14 that naboth was stoned and dead
[17:22] and it came to pass when she heard it
[17:24] that that it had happened that she said
[17:26] to Ahab arise and take possession of the
[17:29] vineyard of naboth the jezreelite which
[17:32] he refused to give thee for money for he
[17:34] is not alive but dead and it came to
[17:37] pass when naboth heard that that I mean
[17:40] when Ahab heard that naboth was dead
[17:43] that he arose up to go down to the
[17:44] vineyard of naboth the jezreelite to
[17:47] take possession of it you see Satan just
[17:49] wants to move you off of your
[17:51] inheritance so that he can come in and
[17:53] take possession of it and and this is
[17:56] how he works I think I'm getting a
[17:58] little stirred up about this because
[18:01] this does raise up some holy indignation
[18:04] in me I don't know how many times I
[18:07] might have allowed that Spirit to do
[18:09] that in my own life surrendering to the
[18:12] devil the things that God had given to
[18:15] me because of a spirit of intimidation
[18:18] because of a spirit of manipulation and
[18:21] coercion and the way that thing works is
[18:24] you think you're calling the shots you
[18:26] think you're doing what you want to do
[18:28] not realizing that you're yielding to
[18:31] the spirit of control that someone else
[18:33] is Anointed by oh my we need naboth's
[18:37] and Elijah to raise up in this hour but
[18:40] don't you worry God knows how to get a
[18:43] hold of that situation he knows how to
[18:45] do something about
[18:47] it in the church this Spirit of Jezebel
[18:50] seeks to bring about Unholy alliances
[18:54] that weaken the foundations of a
[18:56] Ministry you get a couple people licking
[18:59] their wounds together bearing one
[19:02] another's offenses and the next thing
[19:04] you know they cause a ripple effect that
[19:08] goes through the entire body all of that
[19:11] influenced by the spirit of Jezebel we
[19:14] need prayer warriors on their watch in
[19:17] this hour there's no doubt about it and
[19:20] if you'll if you'll remember in second
[19:22] Kings chapter 9: 30 Jezebel got ready to
[19:27] greet juu now now this ju who a a a a
[19:31] word of the Lord in his mouth uh a
[19:34] prophetic man but also he would have
[19:38] position as a future leader as a future
[19:41] king and so Jezebel was not just
[19:45] Satisfied by weakening the influence of
[19:48] this present generation she began to see
[19:51] how she could work on juu she began to
[19:54] see just how she could position herself
[19:58] to control the Next Generation now that
[20:01] sounds just like the enemy if he can
[20:04] weaken the mothers and the fathers then
[20:07] where do the children have a chance if
[20:09] if he can weaken one generation in their
[20:12] conviction in their stand for the holy
[20:15] word of God then what does the Next
[20:18] Generation have other than a weak and
[20:21] compromised and watered down Faith the
[20:25] true foundation of Christianity the the
[20:28] the word of God the god of the Bible has
[20:31] been so watered down and so compromised
[20:34] in this hour until if something doesn't
[20:37] happen to shift this generation this
[20:39] thing will continue to be so watered
[20:41] down it won't take long and you won't
[20:44] know Christianity from any other false
[20:47] religion now that's a hard word but it's
[20:50] nothing but the truth so here she goes
[20:53] in after the Next Generation I think
[20:56] probably her goal was to to hope that
[21:00] something would happen that she could
[21:01] marry ju eventually and control but if
[21:05] not she at least wanted to be able to
[21:07] pull the strings of his mind and so in 2
[21:10] Kings chapter 9 and verse 30 uh and all
[21:14] the way through several verses there I
[21:15] think it goes down to about verse 37 we
[21:18] begin to read about the beginning of the
[21:20] end here uh she got ready to meet ju she
[21:24] heard he was coming and so she got up at
[21:27] the top of the wall this wasn't just a
[21:30] casual hello welcome to the city she had
[21:33] a an agenda for sure the Bible said she
[21:36] painted her eyes she picked out the most
[21:39] alluring gown seductive dress that she
[21:42] could find and she planned a seductive
[21:45] maneuver to entice juu Israel's 10th
[21:49] King and to lure him into forming an
[21:53] alliance with her perhaps like I said a
[21:56] moment ago by becoming his wife but if
[21:58] nothing else she sought to intimidate ju
[22:02] verse 30 and when ju was come to Jezebel
[22:06] or excuse me to Jezreel Jezebel heard it
[22:09] and she painted her face and tired her
[22:11] head and looked out at a window and as
[22:14] ju entered in at the gate she said had
[22:17] zimy peace who slew his master and he
[22:20] lifted up his face to the window and
[22:22] said who is on my side that's a bold
[22:25] move who and there looked out to him two
[22:28] or three Unix the Bible tells us verse
[22:30] 33 and he said throw her down and so
[22:34] they threw her down uh so somebody in
[22:37] the palace realized what was going on
[22:40] there was somebody in the King's house
[22:43] that grieved over the lack of Integrity
[22:47] in the life of Ahab the king there was
[22:50] somebody who said I can't allow this to
[22:53] continue on and so when ju said just
[22:56] deal with this Spirit once and for all
[22:58] throw her down now this isn't the way we
[23:01] deal with the Jezebel spirit today we
[23:03] deal with it on our knees but this was
[23:06] another era of time there there was
[23:09] another way of dealing with things in in
[23:12] the older Covenant and so they threw her
[23:14] down and some of her blood was sprinkled
[23:17] on the wall and on the horses and he
[23:19] troed underfoot and when he was come in
[23:22] he did eat and drink and said go see now
[23:24] this cursed woman and bury her for she
[23:27] is the King's Daughter and they went to
[23:29] bury her but they found no more of her
[23:32] than the skull and the feet and the
[23:34] palms of her hands wherefore they came
[23:36] again and told him and he said this is
[23:39] the word of the Lord which he spake by
[23:41] his servant Elijah the tishbite saying
[23:44] in the portion of jezrael shall dogs eat
[23:47] the Flesh of Jezebel and the carcass of
[23:49] Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face
[23:52] of the field in the portion of jezrael
[23:54] so they shall say not so they shall not
[23:58] say say this is Jezebel see Elijah had
[24:00] already prophesied the ultimate defeat
[24:03] of Jezebel but it was not until God used
[24:07] a juu to actually carry out this
[24:10] ultimate defeat and and cause her
[24:13] influence to be broken the thing is
[24:15] we're not dealing with a natural Jezebel
[24:18] we're dealing with the spirit and so if
[24:20] that Spirit uses one person and that
[24:22] person is removed or dies or gets
[24:25] delivered that Spirit just looks to find
[24:27] someone El else that it can work through
[24:30] and someone else that it can control and
[24:33] manipulate and so we've got to get on
[24:35] our prayer bones as the oldtimers used
[24:38] to say and touch God although the
[24:41] breaking of the Jezebel spirit or
[24:43] influence in Israel began with Elijah it
[24:46] was not completed until the next
[24:49] generation and this is very important
[24:52] for us to remember because really uh it
[24:55] appears that some of that responsibility
[24:57] is falling on us and this hour remember
[24:59] that God told Elijah to anoint juu king
[25:02] of Israel but it was actually during
[25:04] Elisha's time that that that that
[25:07] fulfillment was carried out this is a
[25:10] proper there is a proper time for
[25:12] everything even for the Fulfillment of
[25:15] God's instructions listen carefully to
[25:17] what I'm about to share with you the
[25:19] responsibility to deal with the Jezebel
[25:22] spirit that for too long has had control
[25:24] over the Church of the Living God falls
[25:27] on this generation are you willing to
[25:30] take up that task we must contend for
[25:34] the spirit and power of Elijah to anoint
[25:37] us to take authority over that Spirit of
[25:41] control we must not shy away from this
[25:45] responsibility now in order to do that
[25:48] we're going to have to look inward we're
[25:50] going to have to do some searching and
[25:52] I'll share that with you in the next
[25:54] broadcast I want to pray for you right
[25:56] now I want to ask the Lord to begin to
[25:59] reveal to you uh situations that you
[26:02] might be in where the spirit of Jezebel
[26:05] or a spirit like unto Jezebel is trying
[26:08] to control and manipulate and hold back
[26:12] the advancement of the kingdom of God if
[26:14] God begins to reveal that to you and
[26:17] release strategy and anointing and
[26:19] authority to deal with it you're going
[26:21] to have to rise up to the task father I
[26:24] ask you right now in the mighty name of
[26:26] the Lord Jesus Christ to begin to unveil
[26:30] reveal expose ways that the spirit of
[26:33] Jezebel has sought to control leadership
[26:37] in the Nations and in the Church of the
[26:40] Living God and let there be those under
[26:42] the sound of my voice who have been
[26:45] positioned and prepared and equipped by
[26:48] the Holy Spirit to rise up under the
[26:50] spirit and power of Elijah to deal with
[26:54] that Spirit of manipulation and control
[26:56] we say to the enemy you're being exposed
[26:59] now and your kingdom is about to crumble
[27:03] Lord I ask for strength and wisdom and
[27:05] courage and integrity to rise up in your
[27:08] people across the world in the mighty
[27:11] name of the Lord Jesus Christ well amen
[27:14] you have the power to begin to pray and
[27:17] let God use you in the spirit to break
[27:20] the influence of that old Wicked Jezebel
[27:23] spirit I want to thank you for uh
[27:26] sticking with me through this intense
[27:29] topic I want to invite you to come back
[27:31] next time and watch another episode of
