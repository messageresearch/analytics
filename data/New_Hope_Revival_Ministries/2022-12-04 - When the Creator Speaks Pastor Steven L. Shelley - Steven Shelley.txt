good to be in the house of the Lord today in it amen amen hallelujah hallelujah I know there are many missing this morning many traveling I believe some sick let's remember all them to the Lord this morning do you have a need by the uplifting of your hand I know there are many many on the streaming let's remember all of those would you remember again brother Greeley's sister Phyllis in the loss of her husband Tony that God will minister to her and help her and the entire Greeley family and remember those Nathan flew back home last night and uh Josh and charity and uh Luke and Megan and Shiloh will be coming in this evening let's pray for safety for them for the Greeley is anticipating starting the drive home from Pennsylvania tomorrow unless something should come up there in the family so we want to hold him up to the Lord in prayer we want you to remember little Eli sister Rebecca's nephew belonging to Austin and Hannah he has been had some problems with the with the Billy Rubin numbers and was under the light but has had a great response and was allowed to go home even though they told him yesterday morning they were going to keep him for an extra day they decided to send him home so they're praising the Lord for that also sister Rebecca's sister Lily could use our prayers the Lord has placed something in her heart and the enemy is doing everything he can to oppose and to distract her but we know that the devil is defeated sister Sandy Mann requires our prayers this morning she is fighting something in her body and is going for uh to the clinic this afternoon to see if they can do something for her but we know that the Lord can certainly beat him to it he knows how and then one of our faithful streamers a friend from my childhood sister Dora is asking prayer an unspoken request and also sickness in her home we need prayer our family needs prayer we're I'm sensing this morning that we're under an attack of Benjamin uh nearly passed out in the bathroom back here this morning before service went pale as a ghost and I've been sick this week my wife was battling and you know sickness comes but I just discern and sense deeply this morning that it's more than that and we know that the Lord is more than able and I'm sure if we're under attack then I'm sure that there are others in the church that are facing the same kind of adversity but we know who the victory is Lord Jesus Christ has already won the victory for us Hallelujah sing this with me [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] kingdom of God [Music] [Music] would you come pray this morning [Music] Manchester do you we worship His Majesty [Music] [Music] [Music] flows from Israel [Music] [Music] Lord as we come before you we come with reverence but we long to be there there is somebody that longs to be at your feet looking at you gazing at you hearing from you experiencing you there's nothing in this life that can fulfill the longing in our hearts but you but father we have a job to do while we're on this Earth We're not satisfied with this Earth we're only satisfied with you but father it pleases you as Sons and Daughters of the Living God that we believe there comes Authority from the throne and father we just come in the name of Jesus and we lift the needs that seem unbearable on our own but because of who you are the vanished before the authority of the king so we pray Lord for those that are needy in their bodies it is the pleasure of our father to heal his children so we receive the authority from the throne the virtue of Christ that comes to heal and restore thank you o God for who you are we don't just want to know it we want to experience it so I just speak healing and wholeness to everybody that are fighting in their body and they seem they think they don't have the the faith to touch you but Lord I just speak Grace over their lives just to relax and to receive let them know that you truly love them when we truly accept that you love us it's so much easier to receive from you for every situation that we're spoken for for sister Rebecca's family everything concerning her family Lord let your will be done every conflict that arises you I just pray you sorted out in the name of Jesus Lord I don't understand sometimes what I go through when I wake up in the middle of night and I have to just wail groan cry I don't know if it's my biology my psychology spirituality I have no idea but the only release I get is to cry before you and now hearing that there's something going on in the spirit realm I just asked Lord that you would dispatch like host of Angels From The Throne of God according to the will of God to deal with the attacks of the enemy and I ask you oh God that you would give discernment Lord help us to see what is happening because there's so much around us that is going on Lord strengthen your body strengthen our Inner Man by the glory of God we need the power of God within to flow out we need the strength of the spirit because that's who we truly are we're children of a spiritual father living in an Earthly body wake us up you said you are the resurrection wake us up Lord let the slumper leave this body wake us up in the name of Jesus and Lord I've cried out for over a decade and I'm still believing there's something stirring I want free access I came to this place because there was an invitation to to come before the Throne of God I still believe it I'm not satisfied satisfied with anything else whatever is needed I just ask that you would come and lead us to your throne Where We Belong I pray in the name of Yeshua our Lord Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah amen amen amen you may be seated this morning we're going to receive the

good he is good he is good all the time all the time he is good well I want you to turn in your Bible this morning if you will this morning to Genesis chapter 1. I don't know if any of you were able to catch any of the memorial service yesterday for brother Tony Pinto but brother Greeley was the leader of the service and uh he spoke in between and he sung and he just created a one-man created an atmosphere for that memorial service and I was so thankful and and and so proud just really grateful for his life and for his ability to lead in a difficult time like that and we will continue to to pray for them and the singing wasn't draggy it was it was the kind of singing that we ought to sing when we're singing a saint home amen and I appreciate it brother Hawk's prayer it was not just a prayer it was a bearing witness of testimony and that is encouraging it encourages us to keep pressing the battle there's a battle and it's raging but Jesus Is the Victor he's already won this thing we just have to stay abiding in the vine he is where our life comes from we're going to read in Genesis 1 verse 2 and 3. and before we do we just want to say thank you for your prayers there have been a lot of text there have been a lot of messages some phone calls checking on me after Tuesday night the Lord really came I can't tell you how he came to help me Tuesday night he helped me so much I don't say that the preaching was good but it was helped by the Lord I'll tell you that because I didn't have the strength to do it but he came and my blood pressure when we went I went for a infusion an IV infusion on Tuesday and that combats dehydration and it's also liquid vitamins and when I am suffering with my with my foot some extra vitamin C is good it's amazing actually and you can only take so much by mouth without having other problems as you all know and so one of the ways to get more C in your body is to take it directly in an IV and so I did that and before they gave me the IV my blood pressure was uh well I wouldn't even tell my wife how high it was Triple digits top and bottom and I came here just worn out from that but God came and he helped me took all week but yesterday my bottom number which is the most important number it dropped to below triple digits so I'm thankful for that and I know that God is moving and I know that that sometimes there is a little witchcraft involved we want to be on guard we don't want to be paranoid or panicked but we want to be on guard because the enemy as I've told you thousands of times he's not going to lay down and play dead while you become like Jesus Christ sometimes we become so absorbed with our own problems that we forget other people around us have problems sometimes we we are the victim of I know you're standing sometimes we become the victim of Friendly Fire did you know that did you know that your friends can be praying against you and not even fully realize what they're doing prayer is not to influence God prayer is to express your faith and his ability to discern and know what needs to be done that's what prayer is and therefore When you pray you should not tell him what to do you know God doesn't need somebody directing him he needs somebody to trust him and so I just discerned even this morning that some of my battle was friendly fire so if you see your pastor in need would you pray that God's perfect will be done in my life and the life of my family and would you refrain from telling God what to do with me because he knows better than you do he knows better than you do and if you see a need in my family would you ask God to to work his will out for them instead of being creative intercessors can get way out of whack sometime with a good heart oh telling God do this and speak that and and shake that and loose that and bind that what we need to do is believe that it will be done on Earth just pray that I'm just going to pray for Elias here and I'm going to say on Earth as it is in heaven for my brother I just prayed a more powerful prayer than you would spend 30 minutes telling God what to do with Elias he knows just Lord don't let Elias get in the way don't let anybody else get in the way of your will being done on Earth even as it is done in heaven that's prayer Jesus wasn't just giving us a suggestion when he gave us the model prayer he was giving us an outline for prayer so please please I know you love me but would you please quit telling God what to do with me and my family and would you please ask the Lord that his perfect will be done on Earth in our lives even as it is done in heaven that's the prayer I pray over you daily and I would appreciate the same people just don't know they get excited and they want to move and shake and change and shift and sometimes God is doing all of that and we get in his way I know I'm in the word I know what I'm saying this morning is in the words I've walked in too many camps to doubt what I'm telling you right now to be the truth I know this is the right way so we should pray that for one another we're not trying to cut down our prayer time we're trying to be more effective when we pray how many of you want to pray effectively and then you want to spend more time praising God and thanking God for his faithfulness than you do telling God what to do when he sown himself into you by the Holy Ghost and by the seed of his word he did that so you would learn to come into agreement Earth must come into agreement with heaven and I've sensed that sometimes people take this place for granted and it doesn't take newcomers sometimes too very long to do the same so let us not do that let's not take this place for granted we don't try to hold you here we don't try to bind you here when you go off you can visit other places and I am confident that you'll not find another place like this place I didn't say not something better maybe you'll find it better but you if this isn't the place I don't know where it is because I know what God's doing here get behind it and that's how you from other churches that you feel Genesis 1. I'm already getting stirred up here and stirring emotions up I saw people getting stirred already well I've never heard of telling people how to pray well I got to I have to it's it's about to kill me I gotta help you Genesis 1 2 and 3 and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said and God said and God said he hadn't been doing any talking but now God say it let there be light and there was light I want you to remember Moses wasn't there he's writing this through a scribe by divine inspiration of what God revealed to him when he put him in the cleft of The Rock and he allowed his hinder parts to pass by Moses meaning it was a revelation of where God had been and what God had already thus accomplished and when Moses saw that in the glory of God he knew it as though he were there Moses being a prophet was given that day access to the mind of God wouldn't that be amazing and in that Mind Of God he saw this event and was able to write it as though he was standing there do you know that's a revelation may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated there there must be a repositioning in a time and season of change I'm telling you right now some of you are going to have to turn loose of some things and it's going to cost you you know that Prophet you were hoping to make that bonus you were hoping to draw we're going to find out in this hour that we can't hold on to things when the seasons are changing and God is saying I'm calling you away from that you're going to have to leave that behind you may not be able to wait until the market shifts you may not be able to wait till the interest rate drops you may have to find yourself taking a loss because when the spiritual season changes we've got to make sure that we are clinging to the right thing and turning loose of the wrong thing and remember what may be wrong to hold on to in this season could have been right to hold on to in the last season doesn't mean it was evil doesn't mean that God didn't give it to you that mean that God didn't call you to it what it means is he's through with that in your life but I didn't see what it accomplished you may never until eternity you may not know why God had you in that or why he had you holding on to that until you move into eternity then you may look back and say oh wow here I didn't think I learned anything here I didn't think I gained anything here I didn't think I got ahead and now looking From eternity's perspective are you going to help me looking From eternity's perspective I see that God was using that it might be a relationship it might be a job it might be it might be a business it could be a lot of things it could be stinking thinking it could be an idea a concept of God that you have held on to something that you were believing with all of your mind and yet God comes along and says it's time for you to run that through the filter of the absolute because we're not following extra biblical books we're following the word I want you to know for your for your pastor I believe that God sent a prophet but when I look for an absolute I'm not looking to a spoken word book because man has had his hand in that I'm looking to the word and when I say that I don't just mean the Bible because man has had his hand in that holy men inspired of God wrote these things but it's been translated and and paraphrased at times to get down to where we are we're talking about the witness of the Living Word Jesus Christ Among Us John saw him on the Isle of Patmos standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks which were not seven individual candlesticks but it was the Holy Menorah it was the representation of the church ages and Jesus was in the middle of them all he was God in Ephesus he's God in laodicea he's God in the age of the Bride that is Dawning and Awakening upon us said my my job my commission my purpose is to forerun the coming you know what the rest of it is the coming word he wasn't building a platform for a person he was making a way for the word to come and in its fullness reproduce the life of Jesus Christ there's so much deity in you right now that you can't comprehend how it how big it is it only takes one drop of him did you know it we know God's not an ocean but brother random talks to us about the ocean he talks to us about Lake one of the Lakes he talks about the fact that you take one drop out and you've got the whole You've Got a representation of the whole thing you break that down chemically and everything that's in that ocean is represented in that one drop I hope you're hearing me so if you've got one drop of an eternal God living inside of you you have the representation of everything he is and let me just spoil this let me just go ahead and spit out where I want to go in a minute there's one thing that I want to emphasize to you this morning and that is he is a creator God is a creator Titan was a created being Lucifer well I had to dig up a clip now I hope I don't well I better not tell you that let me see if I should tell that or not no I don't think I will be right with you Satan is not a creator he was created are you in me he's a perverter brother Branham said he perverts what's already been created but God is a creator creates he creates how does he create anybody know how he creates by speaking do you know how you are to create by speaking do you know you're already doing it now do you know we're creating Darkness when we speak Darkness do you know we're creating chaos when we speak chaos do you know we're creating confusion when we speak confusion that's why the bride has got to check up she's got to check herself in this hour because this is an hour to give ourselves to the word like we've never given ourselves to the word before whatever you do Church don't find yourself disrespecting the word in this hour honor the word do everything you can to honor the word of God do everything you can to honor the word of God the word of God is creative come on and it's alive remember when we say the word of God we're not just talking about the printed page we're talking about the actuality of the word the living person of Jesus Christ he doesn't just live in the prophet he doesn't just live in a five-fold prophet or a five-fold apostle or a five-fold pastor a five-fold teacher five-fold evangelist he doesn't just live in a deacon or a trustee or a minister he doesn't just live in a musician or a worship leader he lives in his bride he lives in his people and so he's in you this morning by the seed word of God and by the infusion and baptism of his life you've been infused with the life of Jesus Christ you've been baptized with the spirit and to have just one drop of God in you is to have the potential of all that God is you ought to shout he's here you know what well you know why you're looking in the wrong mirror you're supposed to be looking at the mirror of his word and when you look in the mirror of his word guess who you see you see the word looking back the Bible tells us through the first church age messenger that we are transformed by looking at him if you want to be a different man than you are today look to Jesus I'm up here I'm up here hello if you want to be transformed to a different woman look Upon Jesus for for if you look upon him you'll live we're not trying to build a memorial to the Brass serpent we're not trying to put Brother branham's picture up so that everybody can sit here on a Sunday morning and see brother Branham pictured there when I first come around the message people they put the picture of the pillar of fire now it's Hoffman's head some Churches you'll see the pillar of fire a lot of them now it it it's uh excuse me it's brother branham's portrait and Hoffman's head over here of Christ so you're looking up and you're seeing brother Branham and you're seeing Christ the whole time that you're here to worship well I want you to know I didn't come here this morning I don't want to make you mad but I didn't come here this morning to look to a prophet I came to look to the one that he came to introduce me to the Lord Jesus Christ we can honor Jesus by honoring brother Branham I understand that but we didn't come here to get a good look at him we came here to get a good look of Jesus Christ if we don't keep that in Balance we'll be guilty of what the children of Israel were guilty of keeping the brass Serpent and beginning to worship Him and look to it as though it possessed power in itself brother Adam said I am nothing just a sinner Say by Grace I am your brother I'm just a vessel I'm just a vessel a servant that he can use so are you so are you and in order for you to understand who you are you've got to look straight to the word and honor the word and the word is the very person of Jesus Christ and we need him in our midst because there's a creative work that has to be done on planet Earth before the bride goes out of here hear me there's a creative work that has to take place so where are the creators if there is a creative work then where are the creators here we are does that sound like blasphemy to you no it sounds like what sets the truth apart from the church so there is a repositioning that has to take place when we recognize that God is squeezing us you know I like to stroll from season to season Josh yeah Alano back there recently saw me in a parking lot and he said I know that's my pastor because I recognize his walk nobody walks like that well I like to kind of stroll from spiritual season I like to walk out of my trials but I right into my blessings but how many of you know you don't always change dimensions and seasons threatened sometimes it's by contractions you know I saw once envisioned Mount Zion in birth pains she was Contracting like a woman giving birth because it is out of because it is out of Zion that sons are born the sons of God are birthed out of Zion so Zion is more than a place Zion is a people and Zion people they come about by a Zion birth and sometimes the squeeze is how we get from one season to the next and there's nothing dignified it's messy it's full of fluid it's full of blood it's full of water it's full of a lot of stuff when the baby comes and then there's That Hideous yet miraculous placenta hairy creature that sustains the life of a of a baby that thing has to come birth is ugly and birth is a mess and you're not going to always stroll from one spiritual season to the next sometimes you're going to be squeezed out and sometimes you're going to walk into your new season with a cone-shaped head because cause things get a little tight in there how many of you have ever had a season where you it was getting a little tied in here somebody said 2020 was like that and then 2021 came and they said 2021 that was it that was the year from you nowhere and then 2022 came and they're saying the same thing and the truth is none of them were hideous or horrible or from hell they were all from heaven they just did not smell the same they don't all look the same because in God their Ebbs and flows in seasons and cycles and come on all of this for a purpose because there are virtues that's more than Thunders by the way virtues that we are climbing and the and the word of the Lord came and said you're gonna get it by births you're going to get them by births you're not going to get them by them dropping down on your head you're going to get them by being birthed from one virtue into another virtue into another virtue as you begin to climb the stature up into climb up into the stature of the perfect man it's the perfect man it's his stature that we're climbing into and the perfect man was John 1 in the beginning was the word the word became flesh and the Word was God come on are you with me we got a long way to go so we better move on can I share with you Genesis 1 through 3 in the Young's literal translation of the Bible let's look at it Young's translation of the Bible in the beginning of God's preparing the heavens and the Earth the Earth hath existed waste and void and darkness is on the face of the deep and the spirit of God fluttering just like brother Branham taught us the Holy Spirit dove cooing and making love over the water now we Now understand that it wasn't the water water spirit it wasn't the water that the Holy Spirit was fluttering over particularly it was what was beneath the water and that was the seed of the previous existence the seed of everything that God created in the original creation because we know that when the Earth was without void without form and void it was not in its original condition because there's nothing in the character and nature of God that creates things as waste God is Not wasteful he's a god of purpose the Earth hath existed waste and void and darkness is on the face of the deep and the spirit of God fluttering on the face of the waters and God's saith let light be and you finish it for me he was calling light to separate itself from the permeating darkness and chaos of a civilization that had failed but all as a part of a living God a rebellion had already taken place and ambition had already took a hold of a created being who was no longer satisfied to live and serve in his estate and Ministry and so he said that we read in Isaiah I will ascend I will exalt myself above the Throne of the most high God I will I will I will I will I will and that plunged the Earth and I know you know this and I'm going to share it again in just a moment I know you know this but I'm getting to something I hope you can stay with me for a little while and let's ride together now I want to read verse 2 and 3. from the translation of the book of Genesis by our late friend Rabbi David Friedman of blessed memory he translated the entire book of Genesis in Hebrew the book is called bearishit and this comes from his translation of the Book of Genesis and title bearish sheet and this is barashit chapter 1 verse 2 and 3. Earth was chaotic and without order and darkness blanketed Earth's surface now Dr Friedman's translation is as close to the original Hebrew as you can come but it reads a lot like Young's literal translation meaning there are not a lot of added words in our King James version of the Bible there are thousands tens of thousands of words that do not appear in the original text they were placed there by King James translators to make it easier to read I'm not saying that we lose inspiration but I am saying that sometimes a meaning becomes more vague by adding extra words to it just simple articles can take you in a different direction of understanding so I like to go back to some of these more literal translations when I study scriptures of this importance Earth was chaotic and without order and darkness blanketed Earth's surface God's spirit hovered over the waters then God declared let light exist and Light came into being it could also be translated light stepped forth it's powerful yes because the original Hebrew seems to indicate and we read in the humash and some of you have a homage in your home and if you do if you will read some of the rabbinical writings and commentary from the humash you will read that it is believed from the original text that this Darkness was a unique Darkness it was not a darkness that speaks of the total absence of light but that it was rather a permeating Darkness because the darkness had stepped forward and the light had retreated so what we really have is a mixture but with predominant Darkness and God said come here light I want you to understand how that everything in creation must respond anybody sit with me everything in creation must respond to its Creator's voice nothing has the choice of saying not today should he speak today to the son shine no more the sun would not have within itself the ability to reason with its creator somebody said what would the son say it would say nothing somebody said wouldn't the son say Amen no the son wouldn't say Amen if the Creator Stay With Me if you're a student especially Stay With Me if the Creator were to say to the son today son shine no more put woof that's it no reasoning no amen no argument this the Earth plunged into total darkness which by the way would be catastrophic you understand it would only take a few seconds for you to freeze to death and all that we know is creation in the absence of the light of the Sun I might take a look I'm not I'm not trying to say that as a scientific expert but I know as you know that without the warmth and light of the Sun the Earth could not exist as it exists today so I love this concept of it being light was there because God was there but he allowed the darkness by judgment to permeate to to be the the dominating factor and the light just sort of stepped back out of the way and darkness stepped forward and one day God just looked down he said it's time to get this thing moving again and all he had to do was say light come here oh that's powerful folks I want you to know who you serve did I tell you that that a portion of that God that I tell you that a representation of that God lives inside of you right here today he lives right inside of your life as a Believer the very God who spoke it all into existence and then after judging the Earth because of Lucifer's Rebellion ambition and subsequent fall then he said I'm going to recreate I'm going to put this thing back in motion and all he has to do is step forward and say to them you just spoke come here light oh Hallelujah and light came into being the only thing we read of in the Earth at this point is water in the chaos and void existed only two great forces Darkness and spirit because remember spirit and Light are of the same essence Jesus didn't say where I go there is light did he he said I am the light understand so where Jesus represents himself in spirit light is there light is there so there were only two but there were two forces mentioned in these first three verses of Genesis one was darkness and one was spirit I want to tell you that's where we are again brother random tells us there's only two forces in the Earth right now and that's good and evil light and darkness come on Abel and Cain Seth and Cain Jacob and Esau Christ and Antichrist just two forces one of which is Darkness one of which is Spirit light and spirit life the darkness was a mixture of both darkness and hidden light in Isaiah 45 and 7. I hope you can stay with me I got something to say Isaiah 45 and 7 he said I formed the light and look what else two forces one is darkness and one is light one is Darkness one is Spirit and God made them both you believe that do you understand that God made them both why there's no other Creator Satan's not a Creator angels are not creators I know you're sleepy but can you stay with me I formed the light I and create Darkness I make peace and here is the Clincher and what else do I do create evil Satan is not a creator somebody say that with me Satan is not a creator he can't create evil he didn't have to it was already created God created light and he created Darkness he created peace and he created evil he created the tempter he knew when he made this created being so beautiful he knew what was what was going to be missing just like when he created Eve when he took Eve out of Adam he knew that by bringing her out of the original creation and standing her on her own he knew the predisposition would be there to fall he saw that it doesn't make her less than a man it doesn't make her some poor poor decrepit creature she was just as much here let me let me let me share this with you and some of you will find a quote to I'm sure you will find a quote to dispute me but I want to tell you this Eve was just as much a part of the original creation as Adam was wait a minute brother Shelley brother bran said he was not a part of the original creation but I'm telling you the Bible tells us that she was when brother Branham goes on to explain what he does About Eve you will understand where he was coming from and what he meant he calls her a byproduct because she was taken from Adam but where was she when Adam was made come on where were you when Christ was born there you go she was in Adam in the original creation as soon as she was separated from her original state and from the original creation she therefore had these dispositions and these weaknesses that she did not have as long as she was plugged in to the original creation same way with you and I as soon as we were separated from Christ at Calvary we were already destined to come to the Earth through the church ages with a weakened nature but God had already made a provision I'm going to place a seed in them and that seed is light in life and that seed is word and that seed is going to attract the light and the word if you don't believe that you tell me what happened at the to the woman at the well that seed of God that was in her drew the light it drowned drew the light it attracted the light Jesus said I must needs go through Samaria her need became his need her knee Drew him and he had to need something I need to go because there's a need there that needs me right so she became the answer he became the answer to everything that she was drawing so the seed that was in her already drew the light same way with you because you chose Christ in eternity you came here with a representation of who he is and that seed is what drew the light of this truth to your life anybody with me that's why you are where you are today because there was something on the inside of you pulling that light toward you oh somebody said it took him a long time to get there oh no he was there before you knew he was there he was there before you recognized he was there he was watching over you even in sin Hallelujah like I say sometime in the crack house on the abortion table wherever you might have been he was watching over you because he knew one day that that cry that seeds cry in you would be louder it would be louder than all the other cravings and desires and that you would pull Christ toward you you would attract the word toward you and the word came by your way no wonder brother Linda wrote not even in my wildest dreams did I think I'd ever see such things as the coming of the Lord and the Rapture mystery how are we able to see it the light within us through the light to us [Music] Christ he didn't say I bring the light he said I am the light I am the light of the world anybody with me good that's page one was really page 20 but it's page one from today I formed the light and create Darkness I make peace and create evil I the Lord do all these things heaven was fine in Genesis 1 but something had happened to the earth a correction was needed that word was and the Earth was could easily be translated from the original became and so we could actually read and the Earth became void without form and void in Hebrew it's The Who it means in fact it's only used that way as a phrase in two other places of the Bible we don't have time to read them now but you might jot them down Isaiah 34 11. and in a moment I'll read Jeremiah 4 23 two places in both cases this phrase points to a condition brought by God's judgment therefore it is argued that to be consistent we must conclude that the Earth became without form and void and here in Genesis 1 2 because of some Judgment of God the only prehistoric judgment revealed by scripture is that of Satan when he failed so any time you are reading about this kind I don't know what's happening now foreign what are you coming for isn't he good should we just go home now it's ten till one we could call it a day sweat two even sister Anna she'd break a sweat that might do it let me let me not take that unless I have to Hallelujah so only two places and the only judgment that we can see as prehistoric meaning before Genesis 1 1 is in the description of what happened in Isaiah when Satan Lucifer made his great uh promotion it was self-promotion wasn't it so the Hebrew word here for without form really means waste and hear the earth I want you to try to see this here the Earth is hanging in space unshaped it was once shaped and by the way that's round in case you're hearing something else unshaped unformed undeveloped and unfinished and it's just hanging there and that's so against the nature of who God is hard to imagine even but here is God's spirit hanging over the Earth just getting ready to work with the Earth again and how was it that young put it and the spirit of God fluttering on the face of the waters can you close your eyes and see it I can that sweet Dove of the holy spirit so in Genesis between verse 1 and 2 there must be a gap of Untold amount of time we know this because we read in about a similar period perhaps the same period in Jeremiah 4 let's go there quickly I sure didn't want to go into this but for someone's sake I feel I must verse 23 I beheld the Earth and lo it was without form and void and the heavens and they had no light I beheld the mountains and lo they trembled and all the hills moved lightly I beheld in low there was no man and all the birds of the heavens were fled I beheld and loathed the fruitful place was a Wilderness and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord and by his Fierce anger brother Branham referring to these times talks about a previous civilization so Bible commentators will take Jeremiah 4 and try to apply it to the flood the problem is with the flood The Fountains of the deep did break forth and burst open changing the environment and the surface of the Earth forever but we have no reason to believe that it caused the Earth to become unformed a waste yes but we don't have any reason to believe that the Earth lost its shape or its form because of the flood so this is most likely referring back to the same judgment God told Jeremiah that at the time the Earth was void and without form the condition was such that the mountains tremble Birds fled into the heavens the fruitful had been turned into a Wilderness and cities had been broken down and that fits right along with the quote that we have given many times from the message and it was it was and after this we read that God begins speaking forth I hope you can get with me his creative spoken word into the Earth so it appears that Not only was the spirit brooding over and guarding the seed because that was the spoken word the seed that lay beneath the surface of the water from God's original creation but also hovering there in Divine anticipation for the creative work that was about to come forth again did you follow that God's spirit was in Readiness to take the drowned planet and commence a recreation that would lead to the expression of a man that would be made in the complete and perfect image of the Creator himself so we know that regardless of what form man might have had before this he was not a creature made in the image and the likeness of God perhaps more neanderthal but he was not a man made in the image of God when God made Adam he made the first man that was made in his likeness and in His image but we believe that underneath the surface of that water there were spoken words of God that had come to the Earth in seed form and in the baptism of the Earth because of Lucifer's Rebellion though seed lay beneath the surface of the water the holy spirit is there making love over the word protecting and guarding the seed and hovering in anticipation of the recreation that's about to begin to take place on the earth knowing the spirit knowing that a man was about to be born a man was about to be formed in the very image and in the very likeness of God himself so beneath those wings of the spirit would a work be accomplished anybody hearing that where did the work come from beneath the wings of the spirit remember remember Exodus remember remember the cherubim remember the The Mercy Seat remember the voice of God saying I will meet you there between the wings of the cherubim I will meet you there this was this was another type of what God had already done and what he would later do in even in the hour that we're living in right now and God's word would begin to work beneath the wings remember that that the Hebrew word for without form in Genesis 1 2 is the same word that is translated waste in Deuteronomy 32 and 10. does anybody remember what Deuteronomy 32 talks about you don't have to I'm going to read it for you Deuteronomy 32 beginning in verse 9. let's get a few verses here and we'll try to hurry along for the large portion is his people Jacob is the lot of his inheritance now look at verse 10. he found him in a desert land and in the waist howling wilderness that word waste is without form A wilderness without form he led him about he instructed him Jacob later Israel he kept him as what the apple of his eye now let's put this in context how many of you know what verse 11 is anybody show them as an eagle this verse speaks directly of God redeeming a fallen people and making a mighty nation out of them as the eagle stirreth up her nest what is that word fluttereth same word same work of the spirit even when Jacob was in trouble even when he was in trouble there the spirit of almighty God was around him stirring up the nest shifting things making them difficult and fluttering over him because he was a part of the seed word of God it was from him that a nation was coming forth how many of you understand who Jacob is his name was change what to Israel Israel spread at the broader Wings taketh them beareth them on her wings let's read on so the Lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him he made him ride on the high places of the earth that he might eat the increase of the fields and he made him to suck honey out of the Rock and oil out of the flinty Rock look at the provision that God made for Jacob he began to suck honey out of the Rock and oil out of the flinty rock butter of kind milk of sheep with the fat of lambs and Rams of the breed of Bashan and goats with the fat of kidneys of Wheat and thou did his drink the pure blood of the great this is God's speaking prophetically of what he was doing to Jacob to take him out of himself to redeem him and restore him and make a mighty man out of him how many of you know in order for that to happen Jacob had to go into a wrestling match he had to have his hip dislocated and it left him with a lip and he walked differently than other men and it was not the mark of a handicap it was the mark of a god who had called him and set him apart and redeemed him and flooded over him are you with me like an eagle flutters over her nest like the spirit of God brooded over the seed that lay beneath the surface of the water what what a story what a story this is he found Jacob in the wilderness without form broken down and he made something out of him Isaiah 45 18 for the saith the Lord that created the heavens God himself that formed the Earth and made it he hath established it he created it not in vain Isaiah 45 18. I think I gave you that he hath established it he created it not in vain he formed it to be inhabited I am the lord and there is none also or none else so God is telling us here through the prophet Isaiah that he didn't make the Earth to be an uninhabitable place he made it to be inhabited look at one more place Isaiah 51 verse 15 and 16. I'm pretty sure you have this one but I am the Lord thy God that divideth the sea whose waves roared the Lord of hosts is his name and I have put my words in thy mouth and I have covered thee in the shadow of my hand that I may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth and say unto Zion Thou Art my people now I don't know if you understand the analogy and the poetic language that keeps showing up in the prophets when they are speaking about Israel becoming a nation and God redeeming his people but it's always this analogy of creation of redemption of God taking from the from the chaos and creating something beautiful I want you to know the God that I serve has the innate and and unalienable a privilege and and blessing this amazing nature that he is able to take from the chaos and Draw Something Beautiful Something Beautiful something good oh my confusion he understood oh it's high all I had to offer him it ain't it ain't pretty but it's there was Brokenness and pain but he made something beautiful of my life out of the darkness out of the chaos out of the of the confusion I wish you were with me look what God did somebody said what are you talking about creation yes what are you talking about you I'm talking about your life story I'm talking about you and your Fallen condition I'm talking about you in chaos and utter darkness and void and waste and without form and it came by and he said to you just like he said to the little bloody baby that the prophet found in the wilderness I passed by thee and saw the polluted in thine own blood and said unto thee live this was a father this was a papa this was Abba taking this little Israel this little bloody baby this bloody Little Broken nation and picking her up and saying this this blood flow must stop now I'm going to restore you I'm going to bathe you with my own love and I'm going to make you a jewel among the Nations and this is why God has a bride this is why God has dealt with the Gentiles thus because he also wanted to call the people out of Gentile Nations for his name he loved Israel above all people and Above All Nations but he desired to have a people that would wear his name from among the nations from among the Gentiles how many of you feel privileged to be one of those every time you sing I'm one of them that's also what you're singing I was one who was informed and chaotic and void and shapeless and Confused but I recognized the voice of my Creator and when he called me I stepped forward just like the light separated it's are you with me you're looking around this church you need to be looking up here just like the light stepped out of the darkness you stepped out of the darkness you stepped out of your chaos you stepped out of your addiction anybody hearing me it's just spirit and water and when Spirit spoke there was a separation light is pulled from the darkness and named days and what is left in the darkness is now called night and it took evening and morning to make the first day night did not exist I want you to notice that Knight did not even exist until first light was called forth evil did not even exist until he'd already expressed himself as light and goodness evil did not pre-exist that which is right and good that which is right and good pre-existed that which was evil evil is a byproduct of a creator you believe that you understand that and so not did not exist until first light it was called forth and it was only in that light it was only when the light stepped forth that the waters could then be separated and then a few verses down I'm going somewhere it's taking me all day to get there and then a few verses down the spoken word separates again in Genesis 1. live in verse six and seven of Genesis 1 and God said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters and God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so so some of the waters from the deep were raised up above the firmament to become Waters above so this is kind of an unusual and beautiful picture God was taking from the Waters of the deep and he was dividing the waters first of all the waters are all the Waters of the deep and he divides them by placing Earth by placing a firmament by placing land in the midst of the water dividing the oceans dividing the rivers dividing land now is dividing the water and then he reaches from beneath the depth I want you to see this only because it's beautiful he reaches from the depth of the water and pulls a portion of it up into above the Earth so there are now Waters beneath the Earth and Waters above the Earth Waters beneath the firmament and Waters above the firmament and none of that could take place in the Darkness It could only take place in the light and the only way that it could take place was Creator had to speak and when Creator's voice spoke water separated and when creators voice spoke land began to boil itself up from beneath the depths of the sea I've seen it I've described it to you in vision I don't have time to do that now but I will never forget what it looked like to watch the land begin to to bubble and boil itself up from beneath the surface of the water and I began to see these little seeds of Blades of grass begin to poke up on the land until trees were formed with fruit hanging on them and I said Lord what am I seeing and he said you're seeing acceleration do you understand we're about to enter into a season where we see unprecedented acceleration and what has taken us so long to capture by the spirit we will now have moments of quick accelerated capture we will take a hold of things quicker we will join our faith with the word quicker and we will begin to see some of the fulfillments of the promised suddenlies that the word of God talks about where we labor for Years brother Hawk is up here praying it's the moment brother Hawk is up here praying and he said I've prayed for a decade many of us can say I've prayed for a decade I've prayed for a couple of decades some of us can say I've nearly prayed a generation and yet we have this promise biblically somebody said where is it at it's all through the Bible go through the Bible a time will come it's spoken to us in in in uh in typology it's spoken to us in the symbolism of the scripture and and in order for you to see that you've got to be able to see the Redemption of Jacob tied in with the creation and you've got to see that what God did in creation he did for Jacob and he's done it for you and I so then we go back and see what else did God do in creation and what else did God do for Israel and what else will God do for his bride and it gets pretty exciting anybody hear what I'm saying it gets pretty exciting it's a 111. I have a few more moments you folks have been trying to make me think it was too it ain't John chapter 1. folks we go to church twice a week you can plan your things around church if you only go twice a week you can plan things around Church it's important to do so it's important to honor the word in this hour that's why you're here you've come to honor the Lord which is the word you've come to worship the word him John 1 1-5 in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the oh fact checkers there you go yeah I heard you say life and light is the same thing and spirit and light is the Same Spirit there it is in him was life and the life was the light of men in him I'm not ready and in him was life and the life was the light of men all right now and the light did what you read it for me would you I'm a little weary shine in the darkness and the maybe you'll remember a study we did on the light we don't have time to do it now but how about I give you she doesn't have these how about I give you four different translations of that verse quickly one says I'm not going to tell you where they come from none of your business the light keep you can look them up you could all you have to do is take that Google it and it'll tell you right what translation it came from in one and I'm gonna be honest with you it's because I've got initials here and I don't remember what all of them are see I wasn't trying to be mysterious the light keeps shining in the dark and darkness has never put it out and the light shines in the darkness and the Darkness did not apprehend it the light shines in the darkness and the Darkness hasn't overcome it and the light shines in the darkness and the Darkness did not overtake it that word comprehended does not mean it didn't understand it it means it didn't put it out it didn't overcome it how many of you know the darkness will never never never never overtake the lies the darkness will never overcome the light because the light created the darkness the darkness didn't create the light the life created the darkness in him was life and that life was the light of men in John 1 verses 9 and 10 I think you have that it says that was the True Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him you read the rest and the world knew him not here he was standing in the world the very creator of the world and the world around him including all of creation of mankind didn't even know who he was can you imagine and they didn't even know him John actually is explaining in his writing because John 1 parallels Genesis 1 in a beautiful way and John is actually explaining much of the symbolism that's used in Genesis 1 notice the parallels between Genesis 1 and John 1 in both we have the beginnings Darkness the word and Light the word existed before the beginning let me say it again the word existed before the beginning because the beginning was in time the word was before time the word was in eternity did you do you understand that it was with God the word was with God and the Word was God before God was God before God was God who's ever heard such a thing the bride has heard it and she understands it God is an object of worship there was a time that God existed as Elohim the all-existing are self-existing one there was no other there was no other there was no one to worship him before he made angels before he made cherubims and seraphims before he created the heavenly host and the living creatures and and all the things that we now know before he created man he existed so the word was before the beginning and in that word there was life God's life and that life was the light for man in the same manner that the light could not be distinguished from the darkness in Genesis 1 until it was called forth and separated the True Light from God which was Jesus who could not be received by many of his own the Bible said because he was hidden from them in darkness in John chapter 1 verses 10 through 13 look at this and we'll we'll hurry he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not what does verse 12 say why don't you just read the whole verse for me but as many what if I were to ask you about that power what would you tell me about it what is the word Greek word for power dunamis dunamis is usually the word that is used for power it's the word where we get Dynamo or Dynamite but this is not dunamis this is exousia and this word exousia means something different than Dynamite dunamis means strength and might exousia means it's more about Authority and ability dunamis is more about strength and might exousia is more about Authority and ability so God is saying to as many as received him to them gave he the authority to become the sons of God the authority to become the sons of God and what else um did you know you not only have the authority to become a Son of God but you also have the ability to become a son of God how is that possible because there's a part of God in you and that part of God that's in you that's going to be very helpful and powerful and important in this hour is his creative nature and that's why brother Branham hangs a whole message on the power of the spoken word because he saw that there was coming a day so dark should we just stop here and finish this another time when you're not so tired I mean honestly should we do it he hung a whole message on the power of the spoken word and the creative nature Stay With Me and the creative nature of the spoken word and how that nothing shifted until the word was spoken this world would have hung forever in a chaotic unformed state had it not been for the power of the spoken word which is a creative word brother Branham emphasized that word in not only a sermon but in the in the entirety of the message the power of when God speaks the church is no longer the voice of God on the Earth Church each book she is no longer that voice she is no longer that representative it's only that which is of him bone of his bone flesh of his Flesh Blood of his blood spirit of his Spirit life of his life light of his light seed of his seed that can speak for him and that is not the church but that is a Remnant that has been called out that is his bride she is not only in Alabama but she is represented all over this world why because she heard a voice a voice that said come out of Darkness I called you in the darkness and now I'm calling you out of the darkness a voice that said exactly that exactly that let there be light how we need to understand that we are the answer we are the response to that voice when he said let there be light you and I must then step forth so we've been given both Authority and ability to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born but next verse verse 13 which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but how they were born hell didn't say by God the translator chose to say of God because you have come from his substance that's powerful I can say it because I'm not referring to the sermon I'm talking to the truth about the truth that's being spoken we're way too Petty far too Petty to exercise our deity far too Petty God never got through off his course God never had a bad day nothing ever took him by surprise he had total confidence in himself somebody said how could you say that because the Apostle tells us he swears To Us by two immutable things who he is his word his name his identity everything else will shake everything else will melt away everything else will fall to the Wayside but there is something that is immutable there is something that cannot move there's something that cannot be shaken there's something that can never be changed there was always the word John 1 says Genesis 1 there was always the word but it had to be spoken before The Light Within it could be fully manifested there was always the word but the word had to be spoken there was always the word anybody with me there was always the word but the word had to be what the word have to be just like in the beginning Genesis 1 nothing could happen no change could transpire until God spoke and God said God is light and God spoke to the light and told the light to come forth you think the resurrection is what do you think the Rapture is it's the light calling to the light get up get up get up get up you're hidden in darkness the dead in Christ hidden in darkness but they shall rise when first John 8 12 then spake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of Life what a wonderful time to talk about light we're about to celebrate the Festival of Lights we're about to celebrate the Feast of dedication or what we call Hanukkah we're about to focus on the miraculous power of God to shine light in a world that is incredibly dark and there is no fear in the light the light has no fear to manifest itself in darkness because when the light steps forth the darkness has no option other than to shrink back do you know that when you walk into a room in the authority and the ability of a Son of God that the Demons of Hell have to pull back somebody said well I don't really feel them retreating that's because you're not speaking Who You Are that's because we have become thermometers instead of thermostats we spend more time reflecting the way it is the way it looks the way it seems the way it feels then we do what we know it ought to be when you and I start having the faith to speak it like it ought to be remember we're forerunners of the light we're not for running Darkness we're for running light remember that the evening and the morning I gotta hurry remember that the evening and the morning were the first day not the morning and the evening so guess when the day got new to guess when the season gets new when it's still dark outside we are Trailblazers we are forerunners of the light the holy spirit said I'm calling you to walk the razor's Edge I'm calling you to be Trailblazers brother Tremaine took the word of the Lord so literal he made himself a a license plate because the word of the Lord said I'm calling you to be my forerunners in this generation and he put Forerunner on his license plate somebody looks at that and says silly old man I'm going to say silly old church that doesn't realize how literal these truths are and if you've got to write it on your mirror write it on your mirror you shouldn't have no lipstick around if you do you don't need it around if God would have wanted your lips to look like that he'd have made them that way when you got here the only reason why that's even attractive in this Society is pornography [Music] one time a preacher friend of mine came to me and said I've got a real problem he said I I I really really really like to see my wife in ruby red lipstick he said do you think God Minds if it's just privacy and and just us and nobody knows anything about it I said yes he Minds because you didn't get that desire to see her that way from God you got it from your magazines you got it from the videos come on now I don't even know why I said that well I'm going back I wouldn't back up now for nothing specialism can you imagine botulism squirted in their face so they can look Forever Young let me tell you something folks get things Mighty out of whack you might do away with your wrinkle lines but you should be more concerned about what's going on in your heart than your wrinkle lines anybody know what I'm talking about if you if you don't have any any markers or something put it on a stick it note post it somewhere remind yourself I am not going to be a thermometer today I'm going to be a thermostat I'm going to speak it the way it should be I'm going to speak the mind of God instead of my own mind help me now I saw the authority a man can have over a body I was in Singapore with Bobby Conner when he had a heart attack I was just there as a guest we were on our way we had I don't worry I think I'd come from Israel and maybe we're going back to Israel and he was to be a speaker but the Lord had given me something and I did I was not invited speaker I was there as a guest and I wasn't to speak I heard a commotion out in the hallway one night I looked out the people and there were doctors rushing into Bobby's room come to find out he had a heart attack in the night was rushed to the hospital for open heart surgery I spent most of the night praying for him waiting for a report someone knocked on my door very early and said they've asked that you would take Bobby's place today and speak I said okay I'll be glad to do that and when we got through speaking we went to the hospital and he was recovering I'll never forget the sight most of you know that Bobby Conner is a large man charismatic prophetic speaker out there on the circuits and a nice man nice brother I think he just turned 70 years old recently maybe and he's a big fellow and there are not many big people in Singapore they had weaved three gowns together to make him a gown and I've never seen such a big man on such a little Gurney foreign he was laying there and he was playing with the doctors the doctors were standing there these Singaporean doctors with their mouths hung open because they they would they said to him they come in they said well everything's going well you're going to do good and he did indeed and I don't know why I had to have a heart attack and I don't know why I had to have open heart surgery and I don't understand all those things but it happened and yet he was in there playing with the doctors the doctor said your heartbeat is a little high I'd like to keep you here until we can get that heart rate a little lower he said where do you want me to put it the little doctor said I have no idea what you mean he said just tell me what you wanted to be he said well it should be it sentence that right now it's going to be a little high because of what's happened but he said it ought to be about such and such and Bobby said okay watch the monitor I leaned in myself it was only a few seconds I watched that thing dropping down to exactly where the doctor wanted it yeah he said that's the power of the creator he looked to the doctor and he said that wasn't me that was the creator that can do that I just have to be in touch with him well I knew it wasn't witchcraft I knew God was teaching me something I've been using some of that Authority this week I'm very new in it I'm having to learn how to operate in it but I believe that God gives his bride both Authority and ability to function as sons of God we may not need it right now but one of these days we may need to regulate there may be no blood pressure medication and I'm not on any by the way there may be no heart tablet to keep your heart pumping there may not be something to control your afib you may have to do it by Faith by speaking the word by believing for a new heart we've got to come to a place where we really know that God is with us and we're going to have to start talking like it I am the light of the world he that father with me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of Life John 8 12. but shall have the light of life first John 1 5. this is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light read the rest there is separation from darkness that takes place and we are called forth into the light and we now identify as children of the day as forerunners of the light and we speak the truth it causes the def the separation it causes the darkness to pull back let me give you one more scripture in closing first Thessalonians 5 6-10 therefore let us not sleep as do others let us doesn't mean we don't take sleep at night therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken or Drunken In the Night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love did you do it this morning and for an helmet read it for God had not appointed us to Wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ this is all about the hour we're living in now it's also a prophecy concerning the resurrection of the Bride we were not appointed to wrath the bride was not appointed to see the last three and a half years of the Great Tribulation for God had not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ if you wanted to read that in Hebrew you would say uh but he has go back uh go back for God had not appointed us to wrath but to obtain Yeshua because his Hebrew name means what salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ so don't be so mystified if I pray using both names who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him do you know what we ought to be doing we ought to be out there saying let there be light let there be light have you got a situation that looks dark hold up your hand if you do have you got some troubles and trials that look cloudy shadowy iffy then you have authority and ability to be the sons of God we can shift the darkness we have the authority to speak to it let there be light but don't use your authority to resuscitate something that God is trying to kill did you hear him did you hear him don't spend your effort breathing life into something that God is trying to kill Let It Go your season is changing Let It Go I want to tell you something Pride I'm speaking to somebody Pride will cause you to prop up what God has already rejected can you hear him sometimes things are already called to an end and you and I are stooped over we mean well but remember the root of meaning well sometime is really Pride we don't want to admit that something that we have put our hands to has failed but how many of you know that just because you haven't seen the results you were looking for doesn't mean it was a failure it simply means that it served its purpose in your life and now God's calling you to something else look folks you're going to have to get over holding on to unfinished business sometime and saying well I can't turn that loose because I didn't finish my course I didn't finish my job listen you better do what the spirit says if the spirit's telling you to get out of there you better get out of there if the spirit's telling you to hang there you better hang there yes yes now let me tell you what the spirit won't do the spirit will not tell you to walk off your job so that somebody else can take care of you so let's not get weird if God is calling you out of something he's already opened something up for you you may not see it yet you may not recognize it yet but it's so I don't need that anymore it's time for someone to get out of the Void to get out of the waste to get out of that unformed chaotic place that you've been walking in in this last season it's time for someone to tell to tell the darkness you you hold back I'm calling the light forward into this situation I'm calling the light into my family right now come on I'm calling the light into my children come on light great light of God come and touch my children great light of God come and touch my situation touch my job situation touch my marriage situation touch my relationships Lord I'm calling the light forth because as a Son of God I've been given both the ability and the authority to do something about it I don't know what the situations of your life look like before we started talking about change but I know some for some of you it's been very difficult but if we can get this message into our heart if we can get an understanding of what God is already trying to lead us into you'll begin to declare and the word of God is nigh you the word of God is nigh you it is near to you and let me tell you how close it is it's in your mouth it's in your mouth it's in your mouth and that's not religious religion is when you're trying to make something happen watch me religion is when you're trying to make something happen oh foolish Galatians you can't make it happen only God can make it happen that's what religion will do for you it'll make you jump through all the Hoops because you're wanting to earn the trophies when you get a revelation of Truth you understand what the trophy is you don't wait to Heaven you don't wait till you get to heaven to get the crown you don't wait till you get to heaven to get the trophy you don't wait till you get to heaven to get the prize once you get a revelation of who the prize is who the trophy is who the crown is you realize he's ours now he's ours now I've already got my reward I'm gonna have a Celestial city to live in one day but that is not my reward I'm on a drink out of a river of life but that is not my reward I'm going to live in his presence but that is not my reward my reward is to have him now to know who he is in me now to know my responsibility now and to appreciate my authority now and to begin to use it to speak light into the darkness where Darkness has prevailed the light can break through it can conquer if you believe that same man musicians are coming we have so much to thank God for in this hour we have so much to thank God for in this hour he's been so good to us how many of you the Lord has been good to you he's been good to me let's stand we're going to give him praise because he's worthy he's so worthy he's so worthy he's so worthy you've got any Darkness trying to follow you around speak to the darkness speak to it and the way you do that is say let there be light let there be light let there be light let there be light you know that darkness that comes over your home sometime that atmosphere of confusion that tries to come over your home sometime speak light to it Speak Life to it in the authority that God has given you as a Son of God come on come on to the music I want us to

worshiping him for another moment or two I want you to begin to think about where you need to put the light I want you to begin to think about what situation you need to put the light in and begin to speak to that I'm telling you you've got the authority to do so if you'll take it if you'll take it you'll take it the prophet of God said you're a little Messiah because you're a part of him part of Christ the anointed one because a portion of the Creator lives inside of you you have a portion of creative Power by the Spoken Word by the exercise of the spoken word it was not until the voice began to speak the word that the darkness pulled back I want you to know those circumstances are waiting to hear your voice that situation is waiting to hear your voice I don't mean uh you're you're not writing poetry here you know this don't have to sound pretty you you're not auditioning for something you just get along with God and start talking to those things speaking the word of faith let it come out of your mouth and Watch What Happens we've proven it and tried it we know it works how many of you have tried it in your life and you've seen the results this isn't Mind Over Matter this is putting faith in action this is not name it and claiming it this is taking the promises of God as a portion of our inheritance and recognizing that we don't wait till we get to heaven to walk in that you don't need that then you don't need the authority in eternity you need it in time so let's take it where are we going come on out here for your mercy never fails me oh what a good one to say what a good one to sing from the moment that I wake up until I leave my name [Music] so that again I love you I love you Lord yes yes yes for your mercy never fills me and all my days I've been held in

depend on you and to trust you you have proven yourself faithful Lord who are we to direct you or to tell you what to do or how to do but what we can do is we can speak the word the word of Truth the word that you have bore record for us to have to keep to hold we can speak that word into the situation and we know we're never wrong it's never wrong it's never not appropriate to speak the word of God into a situation there's creative power in that word once we speak it forth under the anointing of your spirit so we speak into the darkness and we speak into the chaos that Jesus our Messiah said I am the light of the world wherever the light goes the darkness has to retreat so we just send Jesus into every one of these problems that we're wearing today and caring along with us situations that we can't change and problems that we don't know what to do with we just we just call Jesus into those things right now into family situations we call Jesus we just speak the light let there be light
