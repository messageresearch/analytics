TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you've got a well in your belly there's an inspiration of joy that the lord can pour down into the inside of the inside of the inside we're not talking about something that originates in the soul the mind the will and the emotion we're talking about something that originates in the depth of the spirit the spirit of man that has been regenerated it has been remade it has been refashioned by the holy spirit of god and there's a joy that comes forth out of the spirit of man that can be present it can be touched you can reach down and find it you can look for it and find it no matter what the circumstances are you've got a well in your belly you've got a well in your inner being you just have to reach in and remember that god has reconciled himself to you you to himself by jesus christ greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world eternity lives in your bosom you want to find jesus don't go looking at somebody else reach down on the inside of the inside where you invited him to come and live whoa where you invited him to sit and rule and reign from the control tower of your inner man that's where he is and where he is there is peace and where he is there is joy therefore with joy shall we draw waters water from the wells of yeshua from the wells of salvation without joy it's the same as without a vision the people perish they cast off restraint without joy the people wither and they not only wither spiritually they start withering emotionally and they start withering physically real joy resides down in the spirit of a man who knows that he was so for loved loved for such a reason he cannot quite understand but before he was ever born a god loved him so much that he made a plan to come in jesus to come in the son of man in the son of god in the son of david and fully reconcile man back into fellowship with him you're that man you're that woman and if you have no other reason to dig a well to rediscover the place where your joy is that's enough so no matter what has battled you and no matter what the old season has handed to you and no matter how you've been left fighting the greatest battle ever fought there is still joy unspeakable and full of glory and it's found in the deposit of god's life it's within you
