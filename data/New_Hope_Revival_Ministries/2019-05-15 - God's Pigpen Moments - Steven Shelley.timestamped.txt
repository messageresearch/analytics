[0:00] if a pigpen is going to make the
[0:02] difference god get them to the Pigpen as
[0:07] quickly as possible
[0:23] if God has chosen a pigpen for my
[0:26] prodigal and he's chosen away to get
[0:29] them back to him the quicker they get to
[0:31] the school of surrender the quicker they
[0:33] get to the school I mean I'd choose one
[0:36] with comfortable seats and air
[0:40] conditioning and doting loving nurses
[0:44] but sometimes God said they've been
[0:46] spoiled enough now they need to see what
[0:50] happens when you make dumb choices that
[0:52] take you out of fellowship with God
[0:54] there's a price to be paid and I can't
[0:59] always pay their gambling debt or their
[1:01] drug debt I can't always get between
[1:03] them and their problem because sometimes
[1:07] while I'm trying to get between them and
[1:09] their problem I'm actually getting
[1:12] between them and the god who's
[1:16] passionately chasing them down because
[1:19] he wants them as his own if they can
[1:24] just know God in an intimate and
[1:26] personal and satisfying relationship how
[1:30] they got there it's only a part of their
[1:34] story but how many of you know an
[1:36] eternity the Pigpen won't matter every
[1:40] person has to have their own God
[1:41] encounter every person has to have their
[1:44] own pillar of fire experience
[1:45] everybody's got to have their own new
[1:47] birth
[1:48] everybody's got to have a taste of that
[1:50] original manner you can do it for your
[1:52] wife you can do it for your husband you
[1:54] can't do it for your children whether
[1:57] they're in or out you can't do it for
[1:59] your neighbor but I'm telling you you
[2:01] can trust mama you can trust God daddy
[2:07] you can trust God
[2:11] it may look black it may look dark and
[2:14] it may look impossible but I want you to
[2:16] know impossibility is an opportunity if
[2:19] a pigpen is going to make the difference
[2:22] God get them to the Pigpen as quickly as
[2:28] possible
