please give me a break you share an anniversary it's going to be loud to monitor when I'm standing here uh uh with brother branham's first marriage to sister hope many many years ago 1934 they were married and uh that is also the day for those of you who study the message that is uh also this coming Thursday is this very day in 1957. when God gave life to the little fish you know I think that's such a significant story for where the bride is and so I like to Mark those things and uh we have another uh very happy announcement to make today boy you could hear a pin drop in a you don't usually hear silence in a Pentecostal Church like that everybody's wondering if I'm going to be a granddaddy or something it's coming but not yet I won't uh I want Jennifer and Josiah to stand up it is my very happy honor to announce to this congregation that they are now uh and an Engaged couple [Applause] smiles God bless you both [Applause] so you'll be hearing Wedding Bells sometime in the next 10 years ain't no no no no no no we cancel that we cancel that in the name of Jesus sometime in 2023 is that better is that better huh much better well I can just go ahead and give them the date you all are thinking about if you want me to but I was trying to be discreet oh God's good all over this house amen um I am I am extremely embarrassed to tell you uh that your uh little token gift that we give to all of the fathers is leaving Montgomery Alabama about now and will not make it for the service today uh Joshua will you go to my office and get that big uh bear that big bin of pins and put them in the vestibule and I I just didn't want you to leave here empty-handed your present is coming it's a long story we don't want to use the Lord's time to tell it uh but basically websites will continue to sell things they know they don't have in stock because they want your money and so I've been on the phone with them multiple times this week they promised me uh with a swear that it would be here on Friday and it is it they did not come therefore I'm not going to preach a Father's Day message today because my Father's Day message went with the gift I'm going to preach don't you worry but not a Father's Day message I'm going to save it because the sermon is called the measure of a Godly Man and I want to I want to give that to you when I return from Tucson we will do that but I would like to honor the special fathers they're all special I want you to know that dads are very underappreciated in today's society there are some great Statesmen who said that a father has the harder job I will leave that for history to decide but I will say that if a man is going to be a godly man and a Godly father to be able to provide for his children and still be present in their life is a very very difficult uh task for mothers who work at a home uh where we believe God has called them to work a first and foremost they get to be with their children every day because we don't send our children down to Egypt to be schooled we School our kids at home and so the mother has more of an opportunity and that's why I always tell mothers please don't save the discipline for when dad comes home can I get a little help here you grow a backbone and you do the discipline as well use dad as a as as a last resort so that he is not always seen as the one who does the swatting you're with them all day long and if you can't if a situation arises and believe me it will that you can't quite handle then dad comes in and he has been nurturing them already when he comes home and and he can step into that role of disciplinarian and he can also let them know that they're covered so a godly man who's away from the home who who uh has to come home provide oftentimes the discipline and to be present with his children it's huge it's a huge responsibility and Hollywood has made all Dads look dumb and we are not dumb we are very very intelligent beings creatures come on dads and so we are not all you know I I don't know very much about some of the popular television shows but uh I've heard of the cartoon called The Simpsons I've never watched an episode but I've seen a few clips and I know that he is often used as the poster boy of dumb fathers and what a shame why why don't if you if you we don't want to model after Hollywood but you know there was a time when when there were programs like Father Knows Best and my three sons does anybody remember those and dads were made to be or or Beaver beaver's dad here's a church that doesn't believe in television talking about all the old programs well if we could have if we could have it like it was then it would be a little bit of a these these men were made to look like they had some sense and they were present they were present and so I want to honor you men of God you you do not have an easy task I want to specially salute you that have Blended families because when you have a blended family you are taking on a responsibility that was not initially yours and it's a huge responsibility when children and they should never be sorted this way but when they end up being sorted Yours Mine and Ours it's a very difficult path to walk that's why you young men need to make sure and you young sisters need to make sure that when you when you uh are engaged when you ask someone to marry you that it's someone that you can live with for the rest of your life you get one child one chance you'll get one chance you better stick with that you better know her in out up and down and she better know you that way there's not going to be great Revival to follow you need to you need to become engaged in great Revival when you're both filled to capacity with the Holy Ghost and then you won't ever have to do my kids your kids and our kids and you will have a much easier you men will have a much easier task if you wait for the one that God has for you I was I was nearly what 30 years old and before I married and uh it felt a little old I know some of you are single and older than that but it felt a little bit old at the time but but God knows that if you if you marry too early and get the wrong one or if you're married too late and get the wrong one it's hell it's just hell let's just be honest and well I thought it was Father's Day that's right I want to help the next generation of fathers it's not easy a man that won't provide for his own family is worse than an Infidel he's denied the faith and so you better make sure that if you're one of those who believes that your quiver needs to be full the Bible didn't say that every man's quiver needed to be full it said blessed is the man he has a blessing from the Lord but he didn't say that every man's quiver has to be filled to capacity and running over you're going to help me but blessed is but but you you want to know that when you bring them here you can provide emotionally for them and spiritually for a long time maybe even after they're married you still provide something don't you so anyway we are blessed in this body because we have incredible dads here incredible men of God and Men of Integrity and I will celebrate you with a message when we return from Tucson but I want to just quickly honor the uh what we call those the special categories of fathers I want to honor the oldest father who is here in the room uh who said that who said that David said that [Music] take off my shoe you know you were going to be one of the youngest fathers until you met your maker on Father's Day anybody in here older than brother Shaw he's old would you say sister yordis she encouraged you well she's not a dad she's a mom 98. how old are you brother Shaw 64. and proud of it why not any dads here ordering 64. would you please do this for me would you give that to brother Shaw make him stand up though [Applause] that's young I mean really to be the oldest father and be 64. so many of our older dads have gone to be with the Lord and I hope it's a long long long long long time that you're with us and you can be the oldest dad right on for all I care I'm just thankful for you I really am who is the youngest dad no he's dead to be kidding I'm kidding I'm gonna rip my clothes like the Jews you know I know we're being funny I'm so sorry for the religious we apologize to you who are religious we're enjoying our Sunday

one foot on the banana peel to be 30. you are almost there okay we'll save this one for like no I'm kidding come on you walk to me I'm so proud of you David I am I can't tell you how glad I am that God made you a dad I love you and she's so pretty [Applause] I want to know the dad that has the most biological children here in service this morning brother skip have you taken a chance to count how many uh kids you have here in the service this morning and that's how many eight is there anybody that has eight biological children here in the room now I I'm only doing that because at some point we

every one of them in the service this morning isn't that something Abigail's gets to be with us would you see that brother Shane gets home this one is for brother Greeley I think most of you know that sister green slipped away from us this week at uh 88 years old she would be 89 in November she has been a precious friend to me for over 30 years and uh one of the best friends that my wife has ever had there were quite a few years of difference in their age but they clicked immediately and we have never left sister green through these years I think I think they met in about 20 12 or something like that uh we never left her but but my wife cried and she's not an easy crier but sister green meant so much to us we had hours of of close or conversations with her that we cherish she was in Tucson for over 50 years they were in Beaumont Texas before that and she was in Tucson for over 50 years as a pastor's wife and Stacy and I would drive her around the town and she would say right over there we had a meeting with brother Branham and would tell us the Miracles she saw and the people that she met I remember her telling us one day that brother Branham was standing in the back of the auditorium or uh I think it was the German Center or some some kind of public hall the service was over and and normally he would have been taken out after having prayed for the sick but for some reason he was standing there at the door with them and he reached up and took a hold of Janet's hair their middle daughter and said don't ever cut that and that memory was so vivid in Sister Green's mind as we would go over that City she would tell us the great things that she had seen God do so our hearts are hurting only for us we're not hurting for her at all she is in the presence of the Lord and has started receiving a well deserved reward but we would desire your prayers for us she asked me uh close to seven years ago would I have her funeral service and then the next thing she said really shocked me she said I want you to send me off in a good way a grand way and she was a back behind the scenes kind of person but she said I cherish every word you spoke over Perry and she said I just hope that you can find something to say about me when I'm gone and I considered a great honor to do it but a but a heavy responsibility so I would desire your prayers there has not been a lot of time to prepare uh we only found out Friday that the service would be Tuesday and not wanting to miss the weekend we're not leaving until 7 30 in the morning with nothing packed so we need your prayers brother Greeley has graciously allowed me to stay through the weekend and I've already booked places to preach next Sunday and uh but I will have a few days uh in the city that I love very much and be back with you on Monday would you pray for the Green family all three daughters many many grandchildren many great-grandchildren and many of them away from the Lord that God would just send a wave of his convicting Spirit to touch that family and sweep them back into the kingdom of God for such a time as this and we would appreciate those prayers very much would you stand I know the hours late I want you to sing this chorus with me in in honor of Sister Green we were blessed to have her here she sang behind this pulpit and blessed us so much she came to visit our church the first time way back in about 1992. and she was a spry back then and still young and of the life of of everything that we did I have a picture I took him to Atlanta and showed them underground Atlanta and some of the sites up there and Richard and Tina were hearing the kids and and I have a picture of Sister Green hanging on you know the cat was the cat's name Sylvester is that the one that was after Tweety Bird or something like that they had a big old display of that and then before I could stop her sister green had jumped up and grabbed a hold of Sylvester's tail and was swinging on it and I grabbed a picture she was the life of the party all the way through and she could make me laugh like no other Benjamin said this week he said I'm going to miss I'm going to miss the way she threw back her head and clapped with her fingers all spread out and laughed every time she really found something funny she would she would laugh like that she's really laughing today sing This Little Chorus with me heaven sounding sweeter all the time before we go to the word I don't know what key but you'll find a good one Heaven's sounding sweeter all the time see like late it's always on my mind

always on my mind thank you Jesus I'm Gonna Leave This World Behind [Music] oh heavens [Music] sounding sweeter all the time believe that same man let's thank God for the musicians all their hard work [Applause] turned to first Thessalonians chapter 4. verse 15 through 17. God bless all of you who are streaming this service I'm glancing down and I'm seeing multiple Nations represented God bless you some are watching it on YouTube some are watching it on the website some are watching and on Facebook some are watching it on the app we can't see all of you your names at one time but we thank God that you have joined us today and we again wish every father here and there a Happy Father's Day for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout somebody say number one with the voice of the Archangel that's number two and with the Trump of God that's number three and the result I want you to catch this and the result of number one two and three it's not just the result of number three the Trump of God it is the result of all three phases of the rapture that causes the dead in Christ to rise first so there must be a shout and there must be the voice of the archangel and there must be the last Trump of God and when all of these three things have had their fulfillment then we know that the dead in Christ shall get up out of their graves somebody said you don't really believe that we do you don't think that's literal that we do we literally believe now we don't believe that the church at large is going in the rapture just because you have your name on a church or old somewhere doesn't make you Rapture Ready it's whether or not you've really been born again of the spirit of Jesus Christ and a part of his elected and predestinated bride they are not appointed unto Wrath the church itself will go into the last three and a half years of Great Tribulation and will have her robes washed she would not be able to stand before him with the with the spotted garments of denominationalism you help me preach a little bit she must have them clean the blood of Jesus has has certainly been applied to her heart if she called on the Lord the Bible said whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved but if she kept her ties in that old denominational system of the world where things are blurry and gray and there's no black or white then she's got some bud mud she's got some some stuff on her garment and she must also be purified and will do so by her suffering but she will also come up and stand before the the bema Judgment seat of the Lord the little bride will not be judged before that judgment seat she is being judged sifted tested tempted tried purified Sanctified now and therefore she is chosen to according to Revelation to sit down with him in his father's Throne judge the nations of the world and the angels that have fallen that's the word amen let's do verse is that verse 17 and we will have our seeds then we which are alive and remain I'd like to be a part of that crowd I would I'd like to be one of those that's alive on Rapture morning maybe wake up that morning uh with a little little acre pain and all of a sudden realize this is the day I used to hear Sister Green sing the song This Could Be the dawning of that great Eternal morning one of these days it's going to be a reality and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air let's read the last phrase together and so shall we ever be with the Lord God bless that reading of his word you may be seated I would like to read a quotation to you this morning that I shared with you last Sunday if that's permitted it's from the Rapture message Yuma Arizona paragraph 152 through 155. brother Branham is reminding us of the order of the Resurrection I like to call it the three phases of the rapture he says now it's the first thing is the sounding and and he gets a little tongue twisted there finally puts it in order by saying in the highlighted sentence Shout a messenger getting the people ready now I want you to know After the Dark Ages there was a lot of truth that had been lost did you know there were centuries that no one believed in Divine Healing can you imagine going to church every week and not even believing that God is Is A Healer that he's able to heal you and for Generations they didn't believe you could know that you're saved when the scripture is clear they shall know they're saved by the quickening by by the coming alive by the resurrection of their Spirit they will know you know in your nowhere is that all right to say you will know in your knower that you're saved and then he beautifies the meek he makes the meek he beautifies the meek with salvation not Revlon not Max Factor come on now not Clinique not paint and powder hello let's preach Holiness this morning he beautifies the meek with salvation and the word salvation is Yeshua say it with me Yeshua and that's the Hebrew name of the Lord Jesus Christ so the scripture is really say he would beautify the meek with himself it's Jesus that shines out of your countenance it's Jesus that makes you light it's Jesus that causes you to be bright and the direct results of having received his light is you receive love and you don't only receive love you're not just a taker of love you're a giver of love and by this shall all men know that you are my disciples by this shall all men know that you have passed from Death unto life that you will have love one for another we've got to have we've got to have that kind of love it's in US you can't be saved and not have that kind of love Jesus brings it when he moves in but it's the giving you might remember the story of how a friend of ours had an experience with this whole scenario of did you learn to love can you imagine standing waiting to be escorted into the presence of God in eternity and having the question asked not did you dress right not did you believe right not did you go to the right church but can you imagine being asked did you learn to love someone answered and said Lord I loved you but I never learned to love your people now how many of you know there's something wrong I happen to believe that that experience was real and I happen to believe that it stands as a stark reminder to us today that we can get all the doctrines right we can know exactly where to send somebody in the tape but until we can learn to love an unconditional love a love that's not based on someone's treatment toward you the Bible doesn't teach us to treat others as as they deserve to be treated or love others only if they deserve to be loved but it tells us that we should do unto others as we would have them to do unto us not as they do so we're doing right and we're doing good and we're expressing love even if it hurts how many of you know Love Hurts love is costly in all kinds of relationships in Parental relationship and love a spousal and and courtship and it's painful love is painful but let me tell you don't let the enemy talk you out of the concept it's worth it it's worth it the gift to be able to love someone the gift to be able to receive love from someone is priceless and nobody should be loving like the Bride of Jesus Christ we should have the greatest measure of love one toward the other if you believe that same man I I'm being then let's go do it let's go out in this world and love one another loving one another is not accepting immorality it's not accepting perversion it's kindly a powerfully standing against the current of society but doing it with another self-righteous religious demeanor but honey I love you so much I don't want to see you lost and so I'm not standing in opposition of you but I'm standing in opposition of sin because if it's against the word I'm telling you you cannot be given eternal life when you're living a lifestyle that is against the word of God you cannot have eternal life and not live by the word let's read on now the second the shout is the first the second is the voice of the Resurrection the same voice a loud voice in Saint John 11 38 through 44 that called Lazarus from the grave I know that voice how many of you know we know that voice we are not strangers to him we are sheep of his pasture we know the shepherd's voice you don't have to be all that extra spiritual to begin to to discern the voice of the Lord in your own life it never contradicts the word it always goes I've had so many people come and tell me the Lord told me the Lord told me the Lord told me then what do we do we look at the word if you feel like the Lord is telling you something that is contrary to his word you're wrong if I think he's telling me something that doesn't line up with the written word I'm wrong and that has to be corrected amen because the word doesn't adapt to us anybody here we adapt we must adapt ourselves to the word he goes on getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the Dead see to be caught up with it now watch the three things take place the next is what a trumpet a shout a voice a trumpet now the third thing is the trumpet which always at the Feast of trumpets is calling the people to the feast and that'll be oh that's why I read it again and that'll be the how many of you are getting ready for the bride's supper oh not Jennifer's although I'm ready for that too I'm talking about the bride of Christ that great marriage supper of the Lamb and brother Branham tells us where that takes place in the sky he didn't say in this reference in heaven there's more to the sky there are more Dimensions between here and there is that right remember he tells us our loved ones are in a faster Dimension than the one that we're in right now and We Know by that that there's got to be something happen to pull us into them pull them into us and we're changed brother it's it's around the corner can we live circumspectly now can we live sold out to God I'm talking to you can we live sold out to God now can we get this compromise out of the way can we just strip ourselves of the world right now can we just be satisfied with what God's word has given us and how it is that we're to Adorn and make ourselves beautiful salvation and get rid of some of this worldly business that the little bride is seemingly picking up in the last day we don't need it we shouldn't want it we're going to the bride's supper hallelujah we're going to Feast with the lamb that should be enough for us the first thing comes forth is the message calling the bride together that's the shout the next thing is the resurrection of the sleeping bride the ones died back in the other ages they're caught together and the trumpet the feast in in the heavens is in the sky why that's the thing that takes place friends and he goes on we're right here ready now we're right there excuse me ready now the only thing the church coming out has got to lay before the s-o-n to ripen now you've got to be seed [Music] you've got to have the certified seed you can't have weed seed you can't have tear seed because if you are a tear seed you lay in the presence of the son and you just produce a tear life t-a-r-e or a weed I didn't necessarily mean marijuana I meant those ridiculous weeds that every Gardener has to deal with they multiply and try to choke out the life of what you are trying to cultivate but if you are the certified seed meaning you were with him in the beginning in his mind he knew you he foreknew you elected you predestinated you then when you get in the presence of the s-o-n which is what we were doing this morning may I say to the little brother who wrote on one of the reels or one of the posts may I say to you that the local church is sovereign and we set the order for this house so you who said something about what is this jumping up and down all things are to be decent and in order it is Acts chapter 2 not in your Bible have you not read that their behavior was such that they were accused of being drunk how long has it been since someone accused someone coming out of your church of being drunk I'm not trying to be critical I'm not even offended I just simply really wanted to respond I'm not Church of Christ we've had years of sitting still we've had years of folding our hands and trying to play the game and then all of a sudden you realize I don't have to be churchy [Applause] [Music] I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and and do I need to get some of you Brothers to get up here Jesse's not here is he do I need to get some of you all up here Aaron to show them how come here Aaron come on let me let's show him let's show that brother I'm I'm I'm I'm lighting you is pretend now I'm lighting you on fire how do you respond if you get lit on fire oh my and don't forget to get it all at all don't forget to get it oh God I'm burning can you please come and help me while you're smelling your flesh no nobody nobody comes in contact with f-i-r-e fire and wants to be religious or stiff or starchy when you have made contact with a genuine fire that fell on the day of Pentecost there's oh yes [Applause] there's going to be there's going to be some kind yours may not look like mine I know some of you can't dance like I can [Applause] you're looking at somebody that never danced for the world the only dancing I've ever done was in the house of God and I'm not ashamed of it and did you write that you were singing this morning did you you didn't write that well somebody wrote it for you ask them for your part of the royalty they wrote that with you in mind I happen to know part of the kind of week you've had this week brother Greeley talked about him being having already sweaty shirt because he's already been using his energies to Worship the Lord Benjamin Was preparing he was prepared to sweat he borrowed my sweat rag before he ever come out here he said can you got an extra sweat rag I can have I said just brought that one back clean you can have it they're getting ready and when I saw it when I heard those words coming out of brother Josh I knew it had been a particularly hard week and and I was so touched by the fact that he was singing his own story this is why I clapped my hands this is why I praise the Lord not because everything's going well not because I have no problem no worry no concern no trouble no burden but because I've learned that in every situation God in every trial God is good no whoa no matter how black it gets God is good even in the confusion God is good [Applause] [Music] that's the kind of look that's the kind of prison I want I want to be around that I want to be around that I have said before that sometimes people look around the church and say oh these people raise and we got quite a few missing this morning but they look around this room and they say oh these people are all raised in church and had a spiritual silver spoon in their mouth and my they've never knew sin and I like to tell every now and again you don't understand you're sitting in a building this morning with former drug addicts and harlots and [Applause] they're not just dope smokers former dope smokers here but heroin addicts and those who played around with cocaine and we could go on in alternative lives with all kinds of junk we're here by the blood of the Lamb we're Overcoming By The Blood and by the word of our own prophetic testimony and if God did it for us this is why we act the way we do if God did it for us he can do it for anybody who has a willing heart to get me stirred go ahead and praise the Lord it's worthy [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah bonjour my uh blessed brother living in France from the hills of North Carolina streaming the service now from from France God bless you now we've got so much to look forward to in this we are laying before the son to ripen you're gonna you're gonna produce you're gonna manifest what you are who you are that's what's coming out and one day the great combine is going to come by after a while and and the stalks of the wheat I'm I'm reading 155 are in paraphrasing in paragraph 155 and and the stalks of the wheat are going to be burned but the grain you see the seed has a carrier you're not you're not saving the stock you're saving the multiplied seed a multiplication of the original seed that went in the ground that's what the Harvest looks like if there should be a harvest in the end time it'll have to look like the Original Seed which is Christ if there's going to be a bride's Harvest if there's going to be a harvest around them third pool Ministry of the Bride then it's going to have to look like the Original Seed and that's why God sent a prophet who could pay the price make the right choices not perfect born in sin shaping an iniquity he was not infallible every word that come out of his mouth was not the saith the Lord if you don't believe that go back to the beginning of this quote where he starts rattling these three phases of rapture off in the wrong order he did that because he was a man that doesn't make him false it makes him a human and we didn't need him to give us the perfect order we had first Thessalonians to tell us so we just take what he said and compare it there to the word brother Branham was like a wave Chief offering I'm not ashamed to tell it I don't care what they say he was a wave Chief offering over the heads of the people because he was the first son in in this end time to come to maturity but he was not the only son [Music] he was the first fruits there must be a bride coming along that'll manifest the same Life of Christ that will manifest the same seed the true seed for known in Jehovah's great mind in these last days will bring forth of his kind and they'll not be ashamed to be called by his name for these are the certified seed [Music] you don't know what a privilege that is [Music] are you listening to me what a privilege that is to be a carrier of certified seed some of you is not going to make it some of you is not going to make it it's going to have to fall off it's going to have to go to the fire it's going to have to be burned but the seed in you Hallelujah it's going to ripen in the presence of the son amen every time we get under that Glory something is taking place all right are you with me now all right I want us to to move on when we were gathered together last and I just need maybe 20 more minutes something like that which will be short and short oh thank you brother will you come help me pack for Tucson you know what I believe that I don't even let my wife help me pack because I want to stay married forever I don't want to get out to Tucson and not have what I need and have her to blame so if I get out there and don't have what I need it's not my own fault I can't blame nobody but myself isn't that right I want to just give you this little quote here 6 37 Christ is the mystery of God revealed then I want to draw a little parallel for you that we didn't get to last week not knowing of course being spiritual this is Christ is a mystery of God revealed paragraph 637. not knowing this God knows it but if you'll turn and look at the clock it's on the DOT two o'clock oh my that must have been a long service did I say 20 or 30 minutes more I need an hour thank you he said the end of the second pool the third poll is at hand now last Sunday I I now know what year was that that was that was 7 28 July 28th of 1963. is that right how many years ago 60 years ago because we are now 2023 in fact we're coming in to August you you say oh no no no this is no we hadn't reached July yet well look in my life it just runs together it's all in the summer but we're already in the summer so before you know it August will be here in 60 years have passed and brother Branham is saying that in the third pool or the second pool the second pull of his ministry has come to an end and the third poll is coming in it is at hand now what I want you to understand and I'll share that with you for you take a moment I read to you last Sunday some of you were not here but I read to you the vision that we use to explain the third pool and these various things that took place specifically the fishing you remember it how many of you were here and you heard it you've got to be careful that the first time you just pull the line a little bit that causes the fish to go after the bait he thinks he's going to lose it that causes the fish to go after the bait and so what does he do he swallows the bait he he lays down on it you know he opened wide his mouth and says no no no you swims a little faster you're not getting away from me and so then the second time it pulls then you give it a real good pull to set the hook now brother Branham was being taught spiritually how to fish and he made a blunder he snatched too hard before it was time so he caught a fish all right if you remember the vision he caught a fish all right but it looked like a little minnow like a sardine skin stretched over the lure and the line got tangled up and what was that that the angel said don't let your line in in these kinds of times will you give me just a moment let me see if I could find that I didn't want to go there but oh that girl is something else he said I said I I know I did did you amen Josh that girl something else did you say man I heard sister I said I know I didn't do right I said I jerked it when I ought into he said don't get your line tangled up in these kinds of times I want to say that to you and I this morning let us not get our lines Tangled oh I felt something oh I felt something in that it reminds me song she wrote that song that in times like these we need the Bible in times like these we be not idle be very sure be very sure your Anchor Holds and grips the solid rock this rock is Jesus he's the one this rock is Jesus the only one be very sure be very sure your Anchor Holds and grips the solid rock I think of that when I think of this the word being spoken don't get your line tangled up in these kinds of times but folks there's young people there's no time to play now I'm going to say something very plain here I'm gonna say something very very plain I want to say something very very plain are you ready are you ready are you ready I read the testimony of someone who who grew up around the truth and they said they never had had the Holy Ghost and that they literally had prayed that the Rapture would not take place because they had never had sexual relations yet I want you to know that this is a very uh uh oh I knew it'd get quiet you can't believe an old prude like me would even say something like that I I said there's something wrong with this picture here I understand that God has given us this for merit listen if you're not married and you're having sexual relations you are in fornication and somebody ought to look you in the eye and tell you you're going to miss heaven until you make that thing right and that means petting putting your hand where it don't belong putting your lips where they don't belong come on I don't have to spell it out for you you don't need a health class that is something given as a gift it's not yours to take until you're married and then it's given to you as a gift from God to draw you and your spouse together don't you get uh jelly on me now put your backbone up somebody's got to tell it why brother Branham told us we don't even kiss we shouldn't even kiss unless we're married because it causes a reaction in the in the chemistry of the body hello and here's this person that's so focused on that uh something they've never experienced so focused on that that they're hoping that we can be here long enough for them to get married so they'll be able to experience that do you understand that the world around us is going to hell in a handbasket there's nothing wrong with you thinking about your future but that cannot be your only focus we need to focus on being Rapture Ready we need to focus on getting everything under the blood getting the stock out of the way so the seed of Christ can live and thrive in US don't get your eyes on oh I just I want to be here long enough to have a house of my own you're not going to worry about that in eternity I I don't want to call you selfish but if you're trying to hold us here now God's not paying attention to your silly prayer anyway but if you're trying to hold us here so you can use those Pinterest [Music] you that's got your baby names picked and you both case design and your colors chosen that's all right I think you ought to think ahead nothing wrong with a little planning but don't you try to hold me here so your Pinterest can get fulfilled oh Hallelujah we want out of here whenever he'll let us go and we're not leaving here a sick group broken down in feeble come on he's going to have a resurrected bride [Applause] don't get your line Tangled Up and things Con in these kinds of times these kind of times don't don't get to looking at things that don't matter for the hour starting to look loose I mean this I must sound like the Fogie that preached to me when I was a kid I would hear those Old-Timers preach sometime and I think that's easy for you old brother so I must be the old brother and you must be sitting there thinking well you wouldn't be saying that if you was in our place well I have to I have good some good news for you we're closer to getting out of this world Hallelujah than we've ever been before I promise you one breath of Eternity you won't feel cheated out of fulfilling your Pinterest board you won't feel cheated if you leave here unmarried thank you [Applause] I'll be crucified for saying this but you may find a big surprise for you when you get over there in eternity we need to focus right now on being ready Jesus had three pulls in his ministry Noah had three pulls in his ministry we see those three pools all the way through the scripture I'm one who preaches the bride must also operate in three pools [Music] I believe God allowed brother Brandon to be an example for the generation to follow and we are the generation to follow the ministry of the Prophet yes and that's why you'll hear me preaching that there still should be Miracles and signs and wonders even though that made up the first pull of the ministry of Christ and the first pull of the ministry of brother random but I say the bride must also have that same kind of pattern Miracles and signs and wonders and healings that then begin to be prophesying in visions and discerning that led to the third pool which was the word of God being opened now if it was truly open to generation ago I believe that but I also believe that we must have a personal encounter with the opening of the word I believe there's something you better hear this you who study I believe there are some seals in you and I that need to be opened up [Applause] there are some things that's been sealed up in US that the lamb wants to open up so in that third pool Ministry uh uh uh well in there is also the rebuking of the religious you see that was part of the second pool when brother random's Ministry started moving from the magnet of healing and signs and wonders and miracles then the next thing you know he starts moving into prophesying and telling visions and Visions leading to wonderful things happening and taking place then he starts rebuking the organized religion of his day the same thing Jesus did Jesus healed first Jesus performed signs and wonders and miracles first until he captured the attention of the people then he turned in real and rebuked the denominations of his name are you following this he rebuked organized religion of his day and then the third pull of the of the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ didn't take place until after his crucifixion because in order for the third pull to be fully activate there has to be a death and even in the ministry of brother Brandon I'm sorry that I'm speaking like this with some Among Us not understanding these analogies and so forth but you only have so much time but remember this is how brother branham's Ministry began to shift and and although it was so hard on him and so difficult for him he had to start rebuking the way the businessmen were behaving and the way they were whining and dining with the Roman Catholics she was all right as long as the Catholics were getting the Holy Spirit and coming out of that organization but then the ecumenical movement the charismatic movement started breaking out and they started staying in the error and continuing to speak in tongues and then brother Branham because he was a prophet because he had another phase of ministry coming that he had to start rebuking that thing and he said we can't take communion like the Roman Catholic State communion come on and they started shutting him down Full Gospel businessmen Assemblies of God Church of God all those groups that had supported his ministry and and had wanted him to pray for all their sick people they began to shut him down until he also went through a time of just resting remember tent vision he went through a time of just resting and then he was raised up above the room we read it last Sunday he was raised up above the little place of intimacy looking down on what was to take place and the angel of the Lord said I will meet you in there not in a place of religion but in a place of you and Jesus that's relationship I want you to know you can wear the uniform you can follow all the church rules and be lost your women can have long hair and be lost it's not those are not what saves us these are gifts that we give to Jesus Christ because we believe he's called us to be a parable to a world that's going in the opposite direction but our Salvation doesn't come by these things oh no and so when we see people compromising on these things it breaks our heart because we know that Jesus is not receiving the reward that the lamb deserves when you start fooling around with you sister start fooling around with the glory that's on top of your head [Music] you are not giving the lamb the reward he deserves it said keep the scissors out of it come on now somebody said is that's just some kind of Doctrine you're bringing no I think I read it right in the book if I remember correctly I read it in the book in fact I think I read it in the New Testament in fact I think I read it in the book of Corinthians where Paul says it's glory a woman's long hair is given her for a glory on her head there's power there I want you to know a woman who has long hair has Authority in prayer you want to get a prayer through you you need some help and prayer support you find you one of these sisters that has chosen to swim against the current of modern society you say sis pray for me that's what the word says it'd be different if we were preaching a church doctrine there why are you preaching that this morning because I see how that enemy wants to steal the authority of the sister he wants to steal the brother's authority too so let me say one more time before I have to come to you personally Brothers you need some bigger britches this is the last Pulpit warning I'm going to come to some of you nobody wants to see your junk I believe I'll take a little water now you see me you see me I'll help you buy them you see me if it's a matter of Economics I'll make sure you get some bigger genes some bigger britches I don't want you to I don't want you to be in a I've been there I've been over the barrel I know what it means not to be able to afford to do better than you're doing you don't have to use that I'll help you we don't want the enemy to be able to take anything away from our testimony our lives are living Epistles read by all men God wants us to be clean before the Lord some of you do dads and all this stuff and stuff that people want in this last day it worries me it's like the sister over there who testified I I didn't want to go in the Rapture because I hadn't had sexual relations you're just kind of playing with fire when you start inching your way toward the world I know you get mad at me I know you do I'm sure you must but I have been through this thing in decades in cycles and I've watched the world creep in and I've watched the testimonies fall to the Wayside I've watched the world swallow up kids that were raised in the truth and had had a touch of God in their life so I am Duty bound and responsible to tell you the truth and I'm not just preaching to your children I'm preaching to mine I'm responsible to do so because the bride yeah has got a Ministry she's got a Ministry all right we're moving on now you still with me did I already use my 20 minutes I did I need 20 more in paragraph 339 I feel good it's Father's Day I feel good I'm doing what I love on Father's Day Hallelujah when I'm done here I'm going to do something else I love I'm going to eat filet mignon and take extra vitamin C so they don't hurt my foot paragraph 339 God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same and that was on the notes from today I believe but now wait in closing we say this but to reject God's simple message to reject it God's simple way is to be destroyed eternally it's better for some to have never heard the truth than to have heard the truth and to reject it God's simple way now that we talk how simple it is and people think well they can laugh at it and run over it I see some of you sometimes sneering a little bit they can laugh at it and run over it and treat it any way they want to but it's Eternal separation from God now wait a minute before you change the slide Nathan what is eternal separation from God to reject God's simple message to reject God some away somebody said oh dear God brother Shelley I I knew better and I went away and I and and and and I did a little and and I got caught up in some unbelief and so forth am I destroyed am I savable don't don't get in that kind of a panic that's not what we're talking about we're talking about somebody coming into the opportunity to receive the the Simplicity of the message and then rejecting it because of their denominational mindset or come around saying well the preachers aren't educated there are people out there that want to know uh uh my my degree [Music] it's DD not Doctorate of divinity but a demon Destroyer yes you tell them we're not in this is wrong with that I have a few smart friends not too many but to educate yourself out of the SIM city of the Gospel [Music] that's dangerous business he said now God's simple way is now that's a treat it anyway they want to but it's Eternal separation from god let's go on those who died in the days of Noah now listen those who died in the days of Noah and did not listen to his message what happened to them they perish and Jesus went and preached to them in the chains of darkness in his death before he rose up leave it there a moment this is the final phase of the third pool in the ministry of Jesus Christ first pull healing miracles signs and wonders second poll the Visions the opening of Truth really we could say the same the ministry of Christ he starts revealing God revealing the godhead like it had never been revealed before but there were there were also discernment coming in and many many things in that in that second pool prophesying uh rebuking the religious crowd the organized religion of his day and then he comes into the third pool after his crucifixion when he descends Into the Heart of the Earth he leads captivity captive gives gifts unto me and the Bible said and he preaches to those who are reserved in darkness we call that place first Paradise for those who died in the righteousness that they knew in the next compartment if you want to describe it that way as hell he visited both he preached to those who had never had the opportunity to know the reality that he was the one they saw him and received him gladly and many of the Saints which slept which had already died arose and walked again the streets of Jerusalem the gospels tell us amen and then he goes into hell and he takes the keys of death Hell In The Grave off of Satan's keychain and his presence there by being there he's fulfilling the third part of his ministry to the eternally Damned can you imagine to be reserved in those flames in that place of Eternal punishment and when I say Eternal it's because it has an ending and once it ends that's forever so don't don't get caught up in the whole concept in fact the most awful punishment that anyone is ever going to know is losing their god-consciousness never knowing again never remembering the soul that sinneth shall he's preaching to those who cannot be saved why because they had to have a judgment against him brother Branham talks about the third pool of his own Ministry and that a portion of that will go to a people that cannot be saved because they've rejected the Simplicity of the message it's not that they didn't have an opportunity it's that God in his foreknowledge saw that when the Simplicity of the truth was presented to them they would find themselves too good for it to educated for it come on to starchy for it they didn't want this Old Holy Ghost away that's dripping with blood they didn't want the way of the Holy Apostles they didn't want the way of the suffering so on asunder uh dwelt in caves dressed in camel skins the despised few and God saw that about them in eternity past before the foundation of the world and a portion of the bride's Ministry here's what you need to know if Noah had a third pool first second third pool and Jesus had a first second third pool if brother branham's Ministry had a first second third pool so will yours it's a typology of the scripture so will yours and that means a part of what you do will be done before those who cannot be saved boy that's a message that ought to shake somebody not because they're not savable but because in the mind of God he saw them before the before the foundation of the world and and saw in his foreknowledge that they would choose to reject him and so there's going to be a whole lot of Pentecostals and a whole lot of charismatics and a whole lot of people in the last days who see a portion of the bride's Revival who will want to be a part of what God is doing but will not be able to be fully partakers of that because they're already in Chains that's nothing to shout about I wouldn't want you to jump up and shout over that but I wouldn't want you to reject it because it goes against your flesh either brother Branham when God worked through him in signs and wonders and miracles everybody saw it but not everybody believed it that's how it'll be in the bride's third pool everybody may have a chance to see it but everybody won't jump in but you won't be so concerned about that you'll be concerned about reflecting Jesus Christ you'll be concerned about being the fully manifested sons of God you'll be concerned about your full adoption is anybody with me Jesus went and preached to them in the chains of darkness in his death before he rose up and he went to hell and preached to the spirits that was in prison that repented not in the long-suffering of the days of Noah while a simple message of God by a simple man was being preached I want you to know they not only had the the condemnation of the preaching of Noah but reserved in Hell had the condemnation of the preaching of Jesus Christ he preached to those who were totally lost and were there because they had rejected the message of Noah now God is really particular about how we treat His prophets and God is really particular about how we treat the message they bring anybody with us is that too much to say all right now I want to close with this yeah I don't believe it yep believe it I just didn't say how long this is in the message Souls that are in prison now thank you Brothers thank you so many streaming the service wishing us happy Father's Day thank you every one of you thank you so much you're kind I was blessed this morning I woke up early and I already had greetings from all over the world many many kind things precious pastors from countries abroad thanking me for being a spiritual dad I cannot tell you what that means to me I I really really appreciate it in the in paragraph 275 Souls that are in prison now I think you will I think this will help you and then we will put this aside I knew that if I forced myself to go in and do the Father's Day message that by the time you heard me again you would have lost some of what we had regained last Sunday so I feel like this was the Lord I don't want to go so far as to say he hung up the gifts because it was much to my uh nerves that really affected me knowing that I was going to have to get up here and say I'm sorry Dad you're the greatest in the world but I but your president didn't make it but I believe God does have a plan for all things I'm hurrying Jesus ministry was when he was Healing The Sick he was wonderful the young prophet of Galilee why makes the blind to see he even raised the dead we got three cases of it he actually raised the Dead now this is how the first pull Ministry of Jesus was the crowds came this is how the First full ministry of Noah was the crowds came this is how the first pull Ministry of brother Branham was the crowds came it may be how the first pool Ministry of the Bride is the crowds may be interested but there's a thinning of the crowd every time is that right let's go on but one day he turned around and said you Generation of Vipers you make outside of the platter clean you appear to be holy but the inside of you are nothing but a bunch of snakes that's pretty rough preaching isn't it you think I get rough sometime oh when that prophecy went forth condemning that organization it changed then they turned against him that's right and finally by rejecting him what did they do They Crucified him if you'll remember that just at the end of the second pool uh toward the end of the second pool of brother branham's Ministry Christ was crucified again in a message called the indictment I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ somebody said how could anybody make such a statement as that because they crucified Christ the word to crucify the word is equally serious to crucifying the man what denominational system in the earth now hasn't crucified Christ the word I know that's rough but do you know of a denominational system out there that hasn't crucified the word to take their Creed and we could go right on and on and on all these borrowed Traditions from Pagan Rome and even those who claim to not be Pagan die their Easter eggs and lay them on the dime red and lay on the Methodist and lay them on the altar some of the things they do around communion is nothing in the world but borrowed from the Harlot system of Rome that's a serious business that bread doesn't become the literal body of Jesus Christ that wine doesn't become the literal blood you don't need the electrical body you are the literal body [Applause] you don't need the little blood you have become the literal blood somebody said what in what do you mean yes bought with a prize you're no longer who you were you're not that old man you've been bought by the broken body and the shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ she is him well that was glorious when that prophecy went forth condemning the organization a chain turn against him finally rejected him they crucified him but you can you can't oh you can't kill the ministry it lives on even Dr Google can't can't kill the real Ministry you can put the messenger to sleep but you can't put the message to sleep right he lived on and notice when the third pull of his ministry come the first was Healing The Sick I just wanted to get this to you uh from him the first was Healing The Sick let's go on the second was rebuking the organizations and prophesying what they had done what they were and what was coming what is what is what will come what was what is what will come that's what he done is that right and the congregation set him in but his third poll was when he preached to the lost that couldn't be saved no more they couldn't cross that Gulf there was no Gulf between those who were in Paradise because they had never saw the coming of the Messiah there was no Gulf so when he steps in to all of those precious people who died under the law and that's not those who were rebelling against the law those who rebelled against the law were in hell but those who walked in all the light that had been given to them without the presence of the Messiah in the Earth they were taken into Paradise and as soon as Jesus made his appearance in the heart of the earth nobody had to convince him who he was their eyes puffed open and as I have told you many times you know Ezekiel said there is the wheel in the wheel Hallelujah uh Daniel there is the one who put the lines asleep and closed her mouth Shadrach me shaking the bed and go there he is the fourth man in the fire David there he is The Shepherd of Israel come on Hallelujah Abraham and Sarah there he is the one who visited with us in our tent there was no preaching don't need need necessary no sir he just showed up and there was no golf fix between them and God so they could just step across that Gulf and he led them out and many of the Saints would slept the rose but those on that other side of the gulf those that had already rejected salvation the message that came through the prophets beginning all the way back to the beginning they couldn't change their Eternal state his third pool which when he preached to the lost I got to stay with my notes got to stay with the paragraphs now so we can go preach to the law said couldn't be saved no more they were down there when the big painted eyes was oh brother bam is talking about his experience should I should I should I stay with my notes should I just read or should I make a little commentary here you know brother Branham had this experience in hell he saw those cat-eyed women I wished I could get a little help in here just to not will help don't be loud just a nod just to not it's nod he saw them cat-eyed women I see them everywhere I go he'd never seen him before I see him everywhere I go in my day he'd never seen him before he's downtown at Sears was it serious Am I Wrong JCPenney excuse me he's down in the in JCPenney and he sees him on the escalator after he had seen that kind of a look in hell he saw women with these big old painted black eyes in hell but it shook him to the core when he actually ran into a couple of them in in Tucson with their black painted eyes all that mascara and all that stuff they wear them spiders glue them on what woman in the right mind wants a spider on her forehead it Disturbed brother Branham of course the only other place that he had seen that kind of thing was hell why don't you help me wouldn't that disturb you what was one time relegated to hell is now walking Among Us it's not the it's not the thing it's the spirit that would cause somebody to want that it's that it's the spirit it's the spirit that confuses somebody in their gender they ignore their Plumbing they ignore their Plumbing because they're under a confused spirit it's someone rejecting and saying God didn't give me big enough eyelashes so I ready God's wrong again The Same Spirit God's wrong again he didn't didn't give me the right Plumbing he didn't give me the right eyelashes he didn't give me the right hair color he didn't give me the right his third pull all right they were down there all right let's go on 280. I gotta I gotta preach to the souls in hell that did not accept Mercy but were eternally separated from the presence of God that's going to be the great punishment to be eternally separated from the presence of God oh my but yet they had to recognize it what it was because God made him there wonder if his ministry climbs out the same way in the last days as it was as the father sent me so send I you the works that I do you shall do also loss could never be saved they had rejected Mercy that was his third pool now when that creative spoken word is fully operational in the bride it's not going to be to the benefit of those that are eternally lost it's going to be to the benefit of those who walk the walk that was his third pool let's go on now is there any question his first fully healed the sick is that right his second Ministry he was prophesying his third Ministry was preaching to the Eternal loss the three mountains so forth the Lost Eternal all right Noah's Ministry all Ministries done the same Noah preached that exactly right went into the ark and when he went to the art there were seven days and nothing happened his testimony preached to the doomed Sodom and Gomorrah Jesus referred to both of them as coming before the coming of the son of man so shall it be like the days of Noah so shall it be like it was in the days of Sodom he referred to Noah Noah had three pulls and his third was to the Lost after the door of the Ark was shut that door won't always be open one day the last Gentile is going to repent and be born again and the mercy to the Gentiles comes to an end and God returns to Israel he returns his Mercy to the original he chosen Hebrews what the word says he goes back to the Jew the Holy Ghost was to the Jew and to the Greek but the gospel returns there at the end when the last Gentile has come in for God let it all sit right there where nobody could enter or go out they were inside for as on the seventh Mountain the highest mountain that's where he settled the ark Mountain that's right we're talking about Ararat now let's go on in the days of Sodom the first pool was the righteous lot now here is an interesting shift to this as the musicians are coming here is an interesting shift to this prior to this and after this it seems that the third pool first second and third pool are different phases of the same Ministry using the same vessel but once it comes here we see God using different individuals to fulfill the different phases of the ministry just watch this it's interesting something I've noticed in the days of Sodom the first pull was the righteous lot and the Bible said the sins of Sodom vexed his righteous Soul daily how them women acted and done and it wasn't just the women by the way the men were burning in passion one for another molested the angels that came in to deliver them there was a lot of things going on sounds about like the hour we live in today celebrating Pride the very thing that got the world and the mess it's in today was Pride we're going to celebrate Pride I don't understand such a thing I think people ought to be treated equal you can say Amen now I don't think people should be mistreated because of their sexuality choice I don't think people should be mistreated because the color of their skin I no but I don't think that people should be celebrated to throw that in the face and especially before my children if I had small children we were in Amsterdam many years ago and had to stand over the the the the carriage the the stroller to keep our kids from seeing men and uh kissing men and women kissing women right on the streets of Amsterdam and here we are a bunch of hillbillies from from Alabama and we think my God we're in Sodom and now it has come to us and it's not equality I'm for I'm for treating people the same it's it's not about that if it was they wouldn't want a month they would want to be treated equal every day of the year their campaign would be let us just be just let us be just let us be citizens just let us just let us live our lives among you it wouldn't be celebrate us for one month and then harass us the rest of the time that this mentality is satanic you don't have to say man I'm convinced of it so as it was in the day he said no what are they doing eating drinking marrying giving in marriage women what what was it the days of soldering women the first message was lot they left him to scorn they they then they sent another messenger two of them that went down see here's another part and look what's his second pull four knot not a lot being the minister of the second pool but the two angels became the minister for the second pool and they went in forelot for Sodom let's go on but look at the one that went last there's more and more Mercy it was all over then all over at that time that third messenger that went down there the third pool what was he let's read what kind of ministry did he have he set with the elected and told them what was taking place behind them who is he describing but when he stepped off into Babylon or into Sodom he wanted to find even Abraham crying it's Abraham here God is using Abraham now lot the two Angel Messengers and now Abraham is standing between God and the people he said if I could find 50 righteous on down to 10 righteous God said yes find 10 righteous let me tell you something sister you might be old-fashioned but you've got something these sex queens has a god you got something they can she can never have you you might be old-fashioned in your dressing dress up like a lady they might say look at that old Holy Roller don't you worry she's got something that the little sex Queen that's got all the world looking at her out there she hasn't got it I tell you I amen if I was listening to this kind of preaching she can never have it lost she's doomed sea eternally you got moral she never you got moral you got virtue she's got nothing she's got a bait that traps that lost soul into hell that bind blind walk into it now you've got something powerful this powerful oh lord of Mercy paragraph 293 we're nearly done you know you might not be even on a church book but it might be your but it might be your righteous life that's holding the wrath of God from the world today I'm gonna read that again your name might not even be on a church book mine's not for a couple weeks or so my name wasn't him on the church signed thanks Ben but it might be your righteous life that's holding the wrath of God you beautiful little sisters you humble Brothers you're the ones responsible for holding the wrath of God off the world today and one day you're going out of here the world that we leave behind will go totally insane because the restrainer leaves the scripture says when he that now liveth will lead until he be taken out of the way the restrainer is here the Holy Ghost is here when you leave the Holy Ghost leaves with you and the world plunges into total insanity you're not going to be around for that you're holding the Wrath back the world won't believe it you woman that's called Holy Roller you little man that don't hardly know anything but you cry to God day and night for the sins of the country you might be the one that's holding off the Wrath if I can find 10 I'll spare it if I can find 10 as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be see what I mean paragraph 294 know if I can find 10 methodists if I can find ten Baptists if I can find 10 Pentecostals if I can find 10 athletes if I can find 10 Senators if I can find 10 ministers but if I can find 10 righteous there's one righteous that's Christ Christ Living in one them ten see I'll spare it but that last messenger preached to the doomed you say he went down there scripture don't say what happened but the fire fell the next morning after he performed those signs immediately after he performed his prophecy Ministry why did Sarah laugh she said I didn't she said yes you did see let's go on now immediately after that he entered Babylon or went down into Sodom never found them so the fire fell he found lot and his two daughters and said get out of here right now the wife originally come out didn't she he said see it went out he went down there remember he was on his road down he sent Messengers before him but he went down himself right to find out if all this thing was so and he found it full of what the message to the Doom what'd they do laughed at it what do they do today the same thing I belong to the assemblies I belong to the Oneness I've danced in the spirit glory to God I speak in you know the rest of that that's not enough all right go ahead I'll cut my hair if I want to I'll do this I'll just say this I don't have to be baptized in Jesus name I don't care what they said Paul's an old woman hate her anyhow that's all right go ahead that's just like the church we had messianics come here and try to tell us that the writings of Paul shouldn't even be included in the scripture I said why because he put the woman in her place because he cleaned the church because he told the man how they ought to be one of these days if you hadn't already you'll cross that line and here is how we know you'll never desire no more to do what's right how do I know brother Shelley that I've blasphemed the Holy Spirit you won't care you won't know and you won't care if you care if there's a measure of concerning you for whether or not you've missed it you have not blasphemed when someone commits that unpardonable sin they step over the mercy and Grace of Jesus Christ and they're sealed their consciouses are seared with a hot iron they lose their consciousness of God and what's right and what matters and what counts now that ought to help somebody [Music] he said brother sister do you realize what's been said you'll cross that line and you'll never want to do it you'll never want to run after the truth that's why in the very last of the last days that the church will be so clean because there won't be nobody with them but the ones that's that's manifesting Christ the one who where the certified seed who carry the certified seed the rest the the backsliders and the friends of the church and those who just come to come that they won't be around they'll they'll cross the line uh if you haven't already you'll never desire no more did you hear what I said it's a matter brother sister do you realize what's been said you'll cross that line You'll never want to do it anymore you'll still hear the gospel sure but you'll never accept it you can't accept it but the gospel will be preached to the doomed those that are eternally lost can't get saved no more you're already in that spot and don't know it you think you're living in pleasure the dead while you're alive he's preaching about The Walking Dead isn't he all right let's finish is that it let's stand I want to know I'm ready now let me explain this to you in closing and you that had a good nap I'm glad you're awake now and I hope you can be concerned about your soul because it's a pretty serious thing you're not getting enough sleep on Saturday night I wonder what you're doing and you might ought to tweak that a little bit because we didn't bring you here to sleep we're here to try to help you you don't have to say anything now you're never going to know by looking in the mirror whether you're right or not because if you go look in the mirror you're not going to like what you see if you're looking in the mirror of the natural you'll see every flaw every Freckle ever wart ever crooked you know ever stray hair you'll see how you're I mean I guess there are some people that look in the mirror and say hey I ain't not good looking but I don't know too many people like that well a few most of us look in the mirror and we see all the flaws and anything that's wrong in the Grand Canyons under the eyes and and you can't get encouraged when you see what's what's there but you've got to remember there's another mirror to look in there's a mirror of the word and the mirror of the word is not showing you how ugly you are not as a bride the mirror of the word is showing you the beauty and Perfection of Jesus Christ so when you really look at the word you're born again you have had the call of God you've surrendered to the call you may be cold this morning you may be lukewarm you may be indifferent but if you should choose today to look at the word he will show you his Beauty if you should join us around this Altar for a moment of worship he will let you see his Beauty you don't have to concentrate on how far how far you fall short all you have to do is say I'm unworthy but my lamb is Worthy I'm not pretty but my sacrifice is I'm not perfect but my Jesus is and if I'll keep looking to him I will be changed into this image if you look at your ugliness you'll only multiply ugliness but if you focus spiritually on his Perfection you'll be changed from glory to glory from glory to glory to glory so there is therefore now I don't care how far we fall there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus all you have to do is just choose to renew your fellowship with him and you know it's so easy to just say Lord I'm wrong Lord I'm wrong I'm wrong you're always right you're always right and I'm I'm a lot of time wrong will you help me be right and he will there may be somebody in the church pointing fingers at you you know what you want not to do that I've known quite a few of you a long time and I remember when you wasn't so perfect there's nobody in here that ought to have a higher spot to where we could really Point our fingers at others and say you ain't there or remember somebody's past well I don't know whether they've repented or not that is none of your business well I know what they did well I know what they did well somebody knew what you did and it didn't prevent you from running to the cross you see if there's any Judgment at all it comes from the word and it comes from this desk because this was ordained by God to set the standard of righteousness from the word for his body not this body his body it's not to come from one another we're not supposed to be pointing our fingers at one another looking for the flaw they're there anybody in here got some I sincerely thought it but I was sincerely wrong just get up there and lead us in worship and quit [Music] with God [Music] you're hidden glory in creation why don't you just come and stand with us [Music] yes yes what a beautiful name it is what a beautiful day it is the name of Jesus Christ [Music] nothing compares to this what a beautiful name it is [Music] so Jesus [Music] [Applause] my Lord yes my Lord my sin was great

times and it hurt him he saw me at times and it hurt him but he never loved me less if it's possible he loved me more why would you say such a thing as that because he went after me he pulled me he drew me he loved me if you stand here today and you feel your failures if you feel your shortcomings if you feel out of joint or out of communion with him all you have to do is just stretch your heart toward him I think we could all do it and then nobody's embarrassed why don't we just stretch our hands like this to him Lord here we are we're very flawed we're very flawed we've come from dysfunction you've called us to Super function but we've come from dysfunction we've come from Brokenness we were we were raised by Broken People we've carried some of their traits forward if it were
