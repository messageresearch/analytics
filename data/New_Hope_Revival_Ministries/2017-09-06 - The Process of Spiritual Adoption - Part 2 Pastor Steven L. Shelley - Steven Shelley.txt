TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to the program today and I believe that the Lord is going to speak to you from his word that's how much he loves you he wants to encourage you he wants to give you instruction and leadership and he just wants to love on you through his word you know sometimes we feel in this life unloved things can happen relationships can be broken and we can fight rejection and we can feel very very unloved and that's evermore the reason why we need to draw very very close to our Heavenly Father because he wants to shower us with his love and there's nothing there's no love in this world that that is as fulfilling as the love of God and I believe the Lord wants to show you his love today and I appreciate you watching this program and if you've not taken the time to contact us at the New Hope revival ministries I'd like for you to do that let us know that you're watching the program and if it's been a blessing to you and all the information of how to contact us is given to you now on the screen and we'd like for you to visit our ministry website as well and take a look at some of the things that we have available there I know that there are good resources there that will strengthen you on your Christian journey and I also want to thank God for the wonderful networks beautiful Christian networks that we have the privilege of being on you're watching this program on one of those networks and we pray for them every day that God will supply the need that he will always bless and strengthen the staff and the leadership of those networks that they will not only be maintained but that they will grow and reach more lives with the good news of the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ let's look to the Word of God we're going right back to where we started last week we're going right back to Romans chapter 8 let's look there now romans chapter 8 and we were beginning in verse 14 for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God and this is where we sort of backed up and left you last program for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption and that's what this series is about the spiritual process of adoption or the process of spiritual adoption but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father and I was talking to you about being in the Jewish market in Jerusalem and perhaps a little boy or a little girl has become separated from their father it can also be their mother and if it was the mother you'd hear a little sweet voice crying Emma Emma but if it was the father that they were separated from you would hear a sweet little voice saying of ABBA and this you know I think the last thing I was saying is I have four children of my own and we had two boys first and then we had two girls and my oldest son will be 11 this year and our little baby girl will turn 3 she's 2 now and will turn 3 and so the other two are in between 8 going on 9 and 4 going on 5 and and so forth but these two little girls came along and they have a way you know there's something about girls they have a way of turning daddy's heart and I mean they could say to me father I need something and and that would be ok but there's something about when these little sweet girls in their little Southern drawl say daddy daddy and I'm telling you when they say that that touches my heart and I would give them anything in my power and they know that and their mother gets onto me sometime because they use that tender little term of endearment to really touch my heart and it is it's almost foreign to many of us as Christian believers to understand that God wants us to have that kind of relationship with him whereby we can cry out to him Abba Father Papa God can you imagine that the god of the universe the one who spoke everything we know into existence created the heavens and the earth created the stars in the universe and put every planet in its orbit who created the Sun and the moon and one of the prophets of the Old Testament describes some of the works of the creation of God and you know he placed his hand on the earth and the mountains seemed to rise up between his fingers and one writer said he spat and the oceans appeared we're talking about a vast God that that it's hard for us to to see that God as our papa as someone who wants to pull us up to himself and put his arm around us and say it's gonna be alright it's going to be alright I've had to do that sometime for my little girls maybe their feelings were hurt someone didn't want to play with them when they wanted to play and their feelings were hurt and I've had to draw them up on my knee and say it's going to be all right maybe in my house their brothers locked them out of the bedroom or something and they couldn't go in and play with him for a little while and they would come crying and I'll pick them up and kiss them and say it's going to be alright and it's hard for us to imagine that God wants to do that for us that's why this adoption the spiritual adoption is so important and that's why the theme of the Holy Spirit in this hour has been relationship and I think we did a good job on the last program covering the the fact that religion is unfulfilled it's not enough you can follow all the rules you can go to church three four or five times a week you can fast you can give your tithe you can shake the preachers hand you can work in the nursery and sing in the choir and take up the offering you could be an usher you can lead the worship or play an instrument and still not be fulfilled not have that real place of Revelation of his love and that intimate fellowship with him but I'm telling you now is the time this is the season where God wants to make that kind of relationship a revelation to you and a reality in your life so we have not received this the bondage that is brought to us by the spirit of fear perfect love casteth out fear but we have received in the place of fear we have received the spirit of adoption now I believe in the fear of the Lord and I believe we need to approach God in what is called reverential fear reverence respect and honor because he is God and we are not but he doesn't want us fearing his wrath and judgment if we're children of God he wants us to know that he would rather his his preferred mode of correction is in love now we talked about last time he will correct us he will take us to the woodshed I don't know if you know what that means in your part of the world but many years ago if if if a boy was acting up his daddy would say meet me at the woodshed and that meant he was going to get he was going to get some corporal punishment he was going to have some you know some physical connection with his dad and God has taken me to the woodshed I have I've been whipped by God I've been put in some hard places but I know at the end and remember I I think I mentioned the scripture about if God loves you he will chasten you and if he chastens you not your illegitimate your none of his but the Bible also said that no chastisement seemeth good in that moment in that season it doesn't feel very good when you know that you've disappointed the Lord it doesn't feel very good when you know that you've failed God it's a hard time in your life it doesn't feel good at the moment but then when it's over and you begin to recognize what was that about that was about grace that wasn't about judgment that was about love divine love and favor he loves you so much that he wants you to be what he would have you to be and he wants to give you the Grace and the strength and the power to be that and what is it that God wants us to be spiritual sons he wants us to come to that place of spiritual adoption verse 16 Romans 8 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and that's that spirit to spirit fellowship and I'm telling you there's nothing like it there's there's no words to describe it and there's no substitute for it fellowshipping the divine presence of God and somebody said well how is that accomplished well I'll tell you there are many ways but the most simple way of coming into spirit to spirit fellowship with God is through praise and worship by by magnifying the Lord with the fruit of your lips by singing to him a song that's to him it's exclusively about him it's not about you it's not about your experience it's not about your reaction to him it's all about him and we sing a song at our church that says it's not about me it's all about you god it's not about me as if you should do things my way it's about you and and God wants us to come into that but that's reverential fear that's the fear of the Lord to say it's not me it's not about me it's not what I want it's what you want and you know there are stages in our life where it's possible that we would resent that that we're not in control but if you can keep walking through those stages and letting the love of God help you soften your spirit and let the Word of God speak to you you'll come out of that I've been there I've been in those places where you think I can't even make a decision for myself and all that you have to do to fix that is to make a bad decision for God to stand back and say okay you do it you try it and then you make one on your own without his help and you fall flat on your face and then you'll be like me and you'll come running back to God and say I don't like it when I have to make the decision I'd rather you lead me I'd rather you guide me and to think about the fact that this this mighty God this awesome God that we just described the creator of heaven and earth wants to be concerned about my little puny life and the little details of my life and where I should go and when I should stay and and what I should say and who I should speak to and where I should be at any given moment to think that God would really care and people still wonder does God really care about all the little minor minut details of my life he does he cares I'll tell you how much he cares he cares so much that he came down from heaven in the form of a man in a son God Almighty became flesh and dwelt among us so that he could understand what it is like to live on the human side of things and yet he was tempted in all manner as we are the Bible said yet there was no sin found in him he went to the cross and paid the price with his own blood rose again from the dead on the third day poured himself out on the day of Pentecost as an earnest of the fullness of what was to come that's how much he cares about them I knew details of your life he paid the ultimate price so that you could come into that place of relationship with him and be led in all things I tell you if you didn't love God before that ought to make you love him that ought to make you want to serve Him that ought to make you want to surrender your life to him and let me just say this there are not there not many gods there's one God one God there's only one and there are not many ways to God people will tell you all religions lead to the same God that is a lie from the pit of hell all religions do not lead to the same God there's only one way to have access to God I don't want to offend you but neither do I want to leave you with a misunderstanding I want to speak clearly to you so that you will know Jesus Christ Yeshua the Messiah said I am the way was he just boasting was he just bragging was that a prideful statement no it was an invitation for eternal life I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me Jesus Christ Yeshua the Messiah is the door whereby we enter to have fellowship with Almighty God and so I want you to examine where you are I want you to examine your belief system I want to ask I want you to ask yourself today have you accepted religion but rejected relationship have you chosen religion over relationship rules and regulations and doing good deeds which is very important because faith without works is dead don't tell me that God doesn't care about our works he does faith without works is dead faith is demonstrated by good works but good works that's not enough it takes the grace of God it takes a real place of intimacy and relationship with him I could go on about that all day but I don't have all day to do it so I have to move on verse 16 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit there it is again his spirit confirming in our spirit bearing witness in our spirit that we are the children of God that's safe that's a safe place to be children of the Most High God and it gets better than that and if children then heirs heirs of God those who have a legal claim on the inheritance that comes from God that's what an heir is and joint heirs with Christ with Messiah with Messiah we are joint heirs he is our elder brother imagine that if so be that we suffer with him and I'm not going to sit here and tell you that there's not suffering in the Christian journey because some of you are watching me in places where you may be greatly persecuted for your relationship with Jesus Christ maybe you know someone who has faced death or has been killed because of the testimony of Jesus Christ I can't promise you that you'll not be faced with that same set of circumstances because there are sufferings those of us who may not be our lives may not be threatened we also suffer with other other ways may be easier ways but nonetheless suffering rejection and persecution misunderstanding malice and slander and those who would like to see us destroyed but if we have fellowship with him in his sufferings if Oh be that we suffer with him we may be also glorified together when he comes into the fullness of his glory you're coming in to the fullness of his glory with him that is good news very good news for I reckon verse 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time whatever you're going through right now may look dark it may look bleak it may look ugly it may be painful but the Apostle said I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed now notice it doesn't say the glory that shall be revealed to us that's good that would be good enough that God would reveal his glory before us or to us that we might see that we might behold his glory but that's not what the verse said the verse says that we may be glorified together that the glory shall be revealed in us in us the glory of God revealed in us manifesting through us to a world that's lost and needy without God who can only see God through others and we are the others that the promise is given to if we are willing to participate with him in his suffering that his glory shall be revealed in us and no matter what you're going through now the Apostle said it's not even worthy to be compared if you if you measured it out sufferings glory sufferings glory sufferings the glory that's going to be revealed every time the glory would be heavier the sufferings would be lighter there's no comparison between the two verse 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature I'm the creature he's the Creator waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God here we are this is a genderless revelation it's not male or female it's not that women can be the Bride of Christ and men are the sons of God that's not how it is it's genderless both men and women can enter into that place of of the bridal expression and men and women can come into this place of being the sons of God and all of creation is groaning verse 24 the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God there is a glorious deliverance that is coming to the people of God where we have been limited we've been limited by this body that we're living in but we're coming to a time and I don't I won't go too deeply into this but for you that have an ear perhaps you will hear it we're coming into a time as the sons of God are manifested as we enter into that relationship of full adoption we're coming to a place where we will not be limited by this creature by this fleshly body that has been subjected to vanity but we're going to come into a place of deliverance from the corruption of the body into the glorious liberty of the children of God I want to say not only the corruption because that's the ultimate effect of death is corruption and we know that the Bible said that mortality will put on immortality and corruption will put on incorruption this is talking about the resurrection the potential for resurrection but there's something else here we're not just going to be delivered from the corruption of this body into the glorious liberty we're going to be delivered from the restraint we're going to be delivered from the limitations of this body into the glorious liberty of the children of God there is a supernatural realm that supersedes the natural realm what is happening right now in the spirit realm is more real than what's happening right now in the natural realm sometimes we watch the news or we see the newspaper and we think oh things are so terrible in the world and and let me tell you something it there there are some terrible things going on in the world no doubt about that fear on every hand the Bible said it's going to get worse men's hearts are gonna fail them for fear because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold we're going to see some serious things but if your spiritual eyes could be opened you would see into that spirit realm into that supernatural dimension and you would recognize that with every challenge that the enemy is is bringing forth proposing in this hour every challenge that the enemy is proposing in the world in this hour in the spirit realm God is giving attention to that in other words angels and spirit angels and heavenly beings are being dispatched and organized and prepared to deal with everything that the enemy is proposing on planet earth and that realm over there although not as easily seen as the natural realm not as easily discerned as the realm you're living in right now it's more real and there's actually more activity going on over there in the spirit realm than there is in the natural right now so God's got it covered let me just tell you that God's got it covered and if you don't know that then you're like a haze I you're like the you're like the servant to the Prophet and he got really worried he got really concerned and he couldn't see what was going on and when when the Prophet looked out across the mountains he didn't see the enemy he saw angels in chariots he saw reinforcements in that spirit realm that were coming down to take care of the battle that was about to take place in the earthly realm the devil can't do anything in this earthly realm that God doesn't already it's not already preparing for it let me tell you something God knows he is omniscient he has all knowledge and he knows what's going on and he knows what the enemy is doing and he knows what the enemy is about to do and in the spirit realm he's already making preparation to meet the challenge of the enemy the prophet of God prayed over his servant and he said Lord open his eyes and his eyes were open to that realm and he saw and this was his testimony there are more for us than against this hallelujah I pray that God will open your eyes and he'll let you see that no matter how dark how bleak how ugly it looks there are more for us than against us and God is already making preparation in that other realm to take care of any challenge any threat any trick that the enemy has I have to pray but I'm feeling the anointing I feel like God wanted you to hear that I feel like God wanted you to know that yeah there's some perilous times there are some troublesome times on this planet right now that will only get worse but God's got it covered brother he knows what's going on and he's going to take care of those who are hiding in the rock of ages' let's pray right now father I just pray that you would touch every viewer and that you would let these revelation truths of in their spirit right now let them be revived and anointed Oh God and and let us leave this program with confidence that no matter what comes you're in control and you're going to take care of those whose hope and whose trust is in you lord release healing for your body in the name of the Lord Jesus Yeshua we pray amen any man well I truly want to thank you for watching part two of this series on spiritual adoption and I invite you to tune in again next week to the Eagles cry god bless you bye bye for now [Music] you [Music]
