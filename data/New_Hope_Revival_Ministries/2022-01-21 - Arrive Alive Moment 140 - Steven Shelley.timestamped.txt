[0:00] he gave you the same kind of an
[0:04] invitation
[0:05] let's go
[0:13] jesus is he gave this follow me to the
[0:18] disciples
[0:19] and he did not tell them what they were
[0:21] going to run into when they got on that
[0:23] boat
[0:26] he didn't give them any details
[0:29] he said follow me or in this account
[0:31] that we read in the book of luke he said
[0:33] let us go to the other side of the lake
[0:37] he didn't give any specifics he didn't
[0:39] lay out the detail he didn't lay out
[0:42] anything that might happen between here
[0:44] and there
[0:46] but he said let's go
[0:48] he gave you the same kind of an
[0:51] invitation
[0:53] let's go
[0:54] and it has taken a measure of faith and
[0:58] at the beginning
[1:00] we have heard in time past that it
[1:03] probably was an intellectual faith that
[1:06] got you started on your road and because
[1:10] many people start out their journey with
[1:14] intellectual faith and think that that
[1:16] is the end of all of it they
[1:19] fall off by the wayside
[1:21] but there are those who know that
[1:24] intellectual faith is not going to be
[1:26] enough to get them to the end of the
[1:28] road and so god has to take you through
[1:32] fiery trials in order to hone that faith
[1:36] to get it to a place where that you can
[1:39] face the next trial jesus remember said
[1:42] let's go to the other side
[1:45] he didn't give him all the details he
[1:46] just said let's go to the other side
[1:48] and he went down in the ship and went to
[1:50] sleep but there on top now fighting the
[1:53] wind and the wave and jesus is asleep
[1:56] and maybe they tried for a while within
[2:00] themselves to row and to get this boat
[2:03] under control and maybe get it back to
[2:05] shore we don't know it doesn't give a
[2:07] lot of details it just says that they
[2:10] were the water was coming into the ship
[2:12] they was filled with water and they were
[2:14] in jeopardy they were having a hard time
[2:18] and they finally they finally went down
[2:21] into the boat and said master we perish
[2:24] [Music]
[2:26] he didn't get all
[2:28] out of sorts and say why did you wake me
[2:30] from my sleep and hey but he did say
[2:34] he as as they came to him and said
[2:37] master we perish he arose and he rebuked
[2:40] the wind
[2:41] the raging of the water and they ceased
[2:43] and there was a calm
[2:46] and then he said to them
[2:48] where is your faith
[2:50] but i have a heavenly father who wants
[2:53] you to arrive alive exhilarated by the
[2:57] experience that you go through you may
[3:00] not feel exhilarated when you're going
[3:03] through the trial
[3:04] through the test but god has a purpose
[3:07] that he's bringing you through all of
[3:10] that and he wants you to come to the
[3:12] other side of that so full of the spirit
[3:15] of god
[3:17] because we're being bombarded by the
[3:20] powers of darkness and we're we're
[3:23] sensing and feeling all of these things
[3:25] and and
[3:26] maybe maybe your highs and your lows are
[3:30] not like that i'm describing right here
[3:32] but that doesn't exclude you from the
[3:35] greatest battle that has ever been
[3:37] fought it doesn't exclude you from the
[3:40] fact that the enemy wants to kill you he
[3:42] wants to destroy you he wants to take
[3:44] you out he wants to derail you from your
[3:48] destiny he wants you to be detoured from
[3:50] your destiny but i know that my papa is
[3:54] his grooming sons he's grooming real men
[3:58] and real women that are full of the
[4:01] power of the living god because he wants
[4:04] you to arrive at your destiny
[4:08] alive
