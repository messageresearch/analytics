[36:51] and that we would receive everything you
[36:54] have for us today we come against
[36:57] distraction

[37:01] cause
[37:02] us with sin to cause us to be sidelined
[37:06] and not keep our focus on you lord and
[37:09] we ask right now that the anointing that

[1:18:43] i just wanted to read that to you all
[1:18:44] and thank you for what you did
[1:18:47] expressing your sympathy and love
[1:18:51] we had the privilege of attending the
[1:18:54] celebration of life
[1:18:56] service for sister sandy's mom gathering
[1:18:59] i guess we should say
[1:19:00] on wednesday evening
[1:19:02] and never having the blessing of meeting
[1:19:05] her
[1:19:06] you feel a little awkward in the sense
[1:19:08] that maya wished you could wish to could
[1:19:10] have known her a little bit
[1:19:12] but we had the most wonderful
[1:19:13] opportunity to get to know her through
[1:19:16] those who loved her so much
[1:19:19] 32 years she and her husband taught a
[1:19:21] class
[1:19:22] at the church there
[1:19:24] and there were graduates of that class
[1:19:28] who testified of her love for the lord
[1:19:32] and her witness to them through the
[1:19:34] years
[1:19:35] and it was such a blessing
[1:19:38] and she decided that she would have a
[1:19:40] funeral for just the family
[1:19:42] and then a celebration of life for for
[1:19:45] friends and loved ones to gather and a
[1:19:47] meal wonderful meal was shared
[1:19:50] and she wanted no tears
[1:19:54] she wasn't there to make sure that was
[1:19:56] kept you know but that was her wish no
[1:19:59] tears just funny stories and there were
[1:20:02] some wonderful funny stories told
[1:20:04] and my favorite of all
[1:20:08] was her request that all the desserts
[1:20:10] should be chocolate
[1:20:15] you know she was thinking of everything
[1:20:18] and so they had a chocolate fountain
[1:20:20] going
[1:20:21] and
[1:20:23] it was special
[1:20:25] we were leaving that memorial coming
[1:20:27] home when the word had reached us
[1:20:31] about the sudden death of charlie and
[1:20:33] rachel collins
[1:20:36] we had an opportunity to spend time with
[1:20:39] them a few years ago at bible conference
[1:20:41] in
[1:20:43] pigeon forge
[1:20:44] tennessee and they were not yet married
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:20:48] we had some fun together brother andrew
[1:20:50] glover was with us and brother erickson
[1:20:53] uh
[1:20:54] junior was with us and
[1:20:57] we just had some wonderful meals
[1:20:59] together and some wonderful fun
[1:21:02] and charlie and his brother abe
[1:21:04] abraham
[1:21:06] they thought it was particularly fun to
[1:21:08] race me on inner tubes in the ice
[1:21:14] and uh rachel she wasn't in for that
[1:21:17] that wasn't her kind of fun
[1:21:19] but she had the best time watching them
[1:21:22] try to beat me and me try to beat them
[1:21:25] and
[1:21:26] the look on her face
[1:21:28] they weren't married yet they only got
[1:21:30] married in in
[1:21:32] this september would have been two years
[1:21:35] but they didn't uh they weren't married
[1:21:37] yet but she looked at him with two looks
[1:21:40] one a very possessive look he is mine
[1:21:44] don't touch
[1:21:46] that was my observation
[1:21:48] and the second look was of of
[1:21:51] unbelievable admiration
[1:21:54] and after hearing her dad speak
[1:21:57] uh
[1:21:59] at the funeral i realized a little bit
[1:22:02] of why she was holding on to him so
[1:22:04] tight
[1:22:05] because her dad was not excited about
[1:22:07] the prospect of a collins for a
[1:22:10] son-in-law
[1:22:12] but he didn't get to make the choice
[1:22:14] they'd already made the choice and he
[1:22:16] honored that choice and i think he got
[1:22:18] quite used to the idea
[1:22:20] and then when we heard as brother
[1:22:22] greeley mentioned in his prayer
[1:22:24] when we heard brother collins give a
[1:22:27] word can you imagine these dads standing
[1:22:29] up at this memorial service and speaking
[1:22:32] so clearly of their faith in the lord
[1:22:34] jesus christ
[1:22:36] for those of you that don't know they
[1:22:38] were 23 and 22 years old
[1:22:41] and there was some sort of gas leak in
[1:22:44] their home and
[1:22:46] just a few minutes after re-entering
[1:22:48] their home there was an explosion and
[1:22:50] they were instantly killed
[1:22:52] and
[1:22:53] everything they owned destroyed to the
[1:22:56] car sitting in the driveway
[1:22:58] and the the debris field i saw drone
[1:23:01] footage the next morning and the debris
[1:23:03] field was blown way out into the
[1:23:05] into the field of the of the yard really
[1:23:08] behind their home
[1:23:10] and then the different things began to
[1:23:13] come in we were told that she was
[1:23:14] expecting a child and that it had not
[1:23:17] been told out to everyone just yet
[1:23:20] and coming up short of their two-year
[1:23:23] anniversary but if you could have heard
[1:23:26] brother collins when he was speaking
[1:23:28] you would have known
[1:23:30] that there are no questions to be asked
[1:23:35] because we are believers
[1:23:38] and believers believe
[1:23:41] we grieve
[1:23:42] but we don't grieve like those who have
[1:23:44] no hope
[1:23:46] we don't grieve like the world grieves
[1:23:48] and if i've ever seen a demonstration of
[1:23:52] that in my life i saw it yesterday
[1:23:55] during the memorial service for two dads
[1:23:58] to be the first to speak and to say
[1:24:00] thank you for your love and thank you
[1:24:02] for your expression and and for a dad to
[1:24:04] say god makes no mistakes
[1:24:07] he said i was very close to of the
[1:24:10] possibility of losing two of my sons
[1:24:12] because josh was on the property
[1:24:15] less than 10 minutes before
[1:24:18] and
[1:24:18] could have lost two sons
[1:24:21] no one wants to lose
[1:24:23] a family member no one no one wants to
[1:24:26] lose a child
[1:24:27] it seems against nature for a parent to
[1:24:31] survive
[1:24:32] the loss the death of a child but my
[1:24:35] faith was so strengthened
[1:24:38] and i was so glad to be a believer
[1:24:42] to believe in the sovereignty of god
[1:24:45] and uh brother branham said that there
[1:24:48] are no accidents
[1:24:53] so when we call it an accident believers
[1:24:55] don't have accidents
[1:24:58] god allows things
[1:25:00] because he sees pain
[1:25:02] he sees heartache he sees something
[1:25:04] worse
[1:25:05] down the line
[1:25:07] and he just claims what belongs to him
[1:25:09] you don't belong to your parents
[1:25:12] you don't belong to your siblings you
[1:25:14] don't belong to your spouse
[1:25:16] you belong to your papa
[1:25:18] and he's the one who calls us
[1:25:21] and so yes there was grief we grieved
[1:25:23] even in our little bit of experience
[1:25:25] with them and a little fun with them we
[1:25:27] grieved
[1:25:28] i woke up all through the night praying
[1:25:30] for their families
[1:25:32] but the truth of it is they're where
[1:25:34] i've got to be
[1:25:36] they're where i long to be
[1:25:38] their battles over their races run their
[1:25:41] struggles are finished they'll never
[1:25:43] ride another mile on the struggle bus
[1:25:47] they'll never fight another battle of
[1:25:49] the mind
[1:25:50] never be discouraged never feel insecure
[1:25:53] again never deal with inferiority again
[1:25:55] no pain
[1:25:57] no doctor's diagnosis will ever bring
[1:25:59] them down again my my
[1:26:03] they're wearing royal clothes and
[1:26:05] walking in a dimension that's more real
[1:26:07] than the one we're living in today
[1:26:10] and what a profound opportunity god gave
[1:26:13] them they there was a whole bus of of
[1:26:16] amish not former amish amish
[1:26:19] who came there to the funeral friends of
[1:26:22] the collins family they're so well known
[1:26:24] in all their different activities and
[1:26:26] their different work and if you ask
[1:26:28] those those guys what what they grew up
[1:26:30] doing they'd say a little bit of
[1:26:32] everything daddy did a little everything
[1:26:34] and the influence that was shown in the
[1:26:37] church family and the strength and
[1:26:39] brother ray erickson the pastor who is
[1:26:42] senior
[1:26:43] and uh yet he got up and preached the
[1:26:46] message and he said i'm i'm here to tell
[1:26:48] you today what charlie and rachel
[1:26:50] collins believed
[1:26:52] i like that
[1:26:54] i like the fact that we don't miss an
[1:26:56] opportunity to tell them if you need the
[1:26:59] lord and you're not walking in the faith
[1:27:01] you need to find your faith and as
[1:27:04] brother greeley mentioned today
[1:27:05] backsliders there who have known the way
[1:27:09] and who have walked away from it and
[1:27:10] they had an opportunity to hear again
[1:27:13] the good news of the gospel
[1:27:15] and so i i'm sad for those families
[1:27:18] i can't imagine
[1:27:20] we celebrated just this week five years
[1:27:23] of the car of the truck accident that
[1:27:25] could have taken our boy's life so my
[1:27:27] heart was already tender
[1:27:30] and then this then this news came and uh
[1:27:32] every parent's nightmare and you can't
[1:27:35] help but think of what they're going
[1:27:37] through but so much was settled for me
[1:27:40] when the dads could get up and say to
[1:27:42] god be the glory
[1:27:44] god doesn't make me listen folks that's
[1:27:46] the god i serve i want to have a faith
[1:27:49] like that
[1:27:53] somebody said well it's just normal to
[1:27:54] question god the believer doesn't
[1:27:56] question god
[1:27:58] when when questions come to our mind we
[1:28:00] sh we pull that down
[1:28:02] we say wait a minute you have no right
[1:28:04] to question god
[1:28:06] he never makes a mistake
[1:28:08] and he is not obligated to tell us why
[1:28:14] one of these days
[1:28:17] can you imagine strolling with him
[1:28:21] i'd like to spend some time with you in
[1:28:23] eternity uh does that make any sense
[1:28:26] what i just said does that make you i'd
[1:28:28] like to spend some time with you in
[1:28:30] eternity
[1:28:32] that's impossible
[1:28:34] i'd like to spend some eternity with you
[1:28:36] in eternity
[1:28:39] i'd like to stroll over heaven with you
[1:28:43] but i'd like to stroll over heaven with
[1:28:45] him
[1:28:47] and he's going to tell me some things
[1:28:50] and i'm going to say oh
[1:28:52] my
[1:28:54] why didn't i see it before that's why
[1:28:59] that's why that had to happen
[1:29:02] that's what you spared me from
[1:29:05] can you imagine him just pulling up a
[1:29:07] little screen
[1:29:09] and saying this this is what you could
[1:29:11] have had
[1:29:12] this is what was ahead
[1:29:14] oh we are grateful people today because
[1:29:18] we serve a great big god
[1:29:20] would you thank god for these musicians
[1:29:22] and these who give them their gifts
[1:29:23] today
[1:29:25] [Applause]
[1:29:29] i'm missing my amen corner brother
[1:29:31] daniel miller i'm missing him today
[1:29:34] he's a one-man amen corner
[1:29:37] and if that bothers you if you'll yell
[1:29:39] and holler as loud as he does you won't
[1:29:41] be bothered
[1:29:44] he is a preacher's delight
[1:29:49] he pulls it out of me
[1:29:52] and i wouldn't i wasn't happy when i
[1:29:54] heard they wouldn't get to be here today

[1:32:02] uh ariely's birthday 13 years old
[1:32:07] how can that be possible
[1:32:10] i still remember being there at her
[1:32:12] house the day she was born
[1:32:15] and uh while she was being born and i'm
[1:32:18] out in the
[1:32:19] in the kitchen
[1:32:21] grandmother comes out and says brother
[1:32:23] shelley you got to pray now there's a
[1:32:25] little complication and you've got to
[1:32:27] pray now and we all just prayed and
[1:32:30] believed that everything was going to be
[1:32:31] all right and it was only just a few
[1:32:33] minutes later that the news came from
[1:32:36] the midwife everything is fine
[1:32:40] she was a beaut one of the most
[1:32:41] beautiful babies i'd ever seen in my
[1:32:43] life and she's still one of the most
[1:32:45] beautiful girls and
[1:32:47] i'm so thankful that we had a little bit
[1:32:49] of time to celebrate her today is sister
[1:32:52] sharon's birthday although she forgot

[1:33:39] life they made a movie about her life
[1:33:41] called china cry

[1:34:02] [Applause]
[1:34:06] then it looks like michael christian has
[1:34:07] a birthday next saturday i'm not going

[1:34:11] but slightly older than four i'll tell
[1:34:13] you that right now and there may be
[1:34:15] others but i don't have them in my
[1:34:17] calendar maybe but if you'll call them
[1:34:19] out anybody call call out a birthday or
[1:34:21] anniversary i missed
[1:34:23] first thessalonians chapter 5
[1:34:27] verse 23 in the amplified
[1:34:30] version of the bible i want to carry on
[1:34:33] just a little bit this morning from
[1:34:36] the message
[1:34:38] total deliverance
[1:34:41] requires total separation
[1:34:45] from unbelief
[1:34:47] this is our
[1:34:48] daily grind
[1:34:50] we are separating ourselves from all
[1:34:53] unbelief because that's what sin is
[1:34:56] sin is unbelief it's not what you do
[1:35:03] it's what you believe
[1:35:05] or fail to believe
[1:35:08] so i came from the old pentecostal
[1:35:10] church and everything was sin
[1:35:13] and so if you stop doing those things
[1:35:15] you are no longer sinning the problem
[1:35:18] with that kind of theology is you never
[1:35:21] deal with the unbelief that's in your
[1:35:23] heart
[1:35:24] so you struggle the rest of your life to
[1:35:26] believe
[1:35:28] if you can deal with unbelief in your
[1:35:31] life you will be able to step away from
[1:35:34] the attributes of sin
[1:35:37] and the attributes are unbelief of
[1:35:39] unbelief for all these things we do in
[1:35:42] themselves not sin but attributes of sin
[1:35:46] attributes of unbelief
[1:35:48] now the apostle said and may the god of
[1:35:50] peace himself
[1:35:52] sanctify you
[1:35:54] through and through
[1:35:56] king james says holy w-h-o-l-l-y
[1:36:01] separates you from profane things make
[1:36:04] you pure and holy consecrated to god
[1:36:09] and may your spirit
[1:36:11] and soul
[1:36:13] and body the tripartate man spirit soul
[1:36:18] and body be preserved sound
[1:36:21] and complete
[1:36:23] and found
[1:36:25] blameless at the coming of our lord
[1:36:28] jesus christ the messiah would you mind
[1:36:32] very much if i read it again
[1:36:34] may the god of peace himself sanctify
[1:36:36] you through and through separate you
[1:36:38] from profane things make you pure
[1:36:41] and holy consecrated to god and may your
[1:36:45] spirit and soul and body be preserved
[1:36:48] sound and complete and found blameless
[1:36:51] at the coming of our lord jesus christ
[1:36:54] the messiah can you think of a greater
[1:36:56] prayer to pray for somebody this is a
[1:36:59] marvelous prayer it's a marvelous
[1:37:02] blessing to release that god would so
[1:37:05] sanctify you
[1:37:07] and so deliver you
[1:37:10] all of you
[1:37:12] spirit soul and body and then preserve
[1:37:15] you
[1:37:15] so that nothing could steal that
[1:37:18] deliverance from your life
[1:37:20] and that you be whole at the coming of
[1:37:23] the lord jesus christ father thank you
[1:37:25] for your word today thank you for the
[1:37:28] promise of total deliverance and we ask
[1:37:31] that you help us to prepare our lives
[1:37:34] for the full demonstration of your
[1:37:36] promise and we'll give you glory and
[1:37:39] honor and praise for it's in the exalted
[1:37:42] name of the lord jesus christ we pray
[1:37:45] amen the saints said again
[1:37:48] you may be seated and god bless you from
[1:37:51] vancouver british columbia and also from
[1:37:55] the philippines how wonderful to be
[1:37:58] preaching today
[1:37:59] in the
[1:38:00] philippines in the message how can i
[1:38:03] overcome i want you to follow this one
[1:38:06] we just read this to you last week
[1:38:08] either sunday or tuesday night i want to
[1:38:11] go through this quickly so that we can
[1:38:12] move on look
[1:38:15] temptation was for him you know that
[1:38:18] the bible said he was tempted in all
[1:38:21] points like we are
[1:38:24] don't forget these last three powerful
[1:38:26] words yet
[1:38:29] yet without sin
[1:38:31] he was tempted by drinking
[1:38:34] he was tempted by women
[1:38:36] he was tempted by everything that could
[1:38:38] be tempted what did you think the
[1:38:40] scripture meant
[1:38:43] what did you think the bible meant when
[1:38:45] it said he was tempted in all manner as
[1:38:46] we are yet without sin
[1:38:49] well you you must have thought he was
[1:38:50] tempted not to go to sunday school
[1:38:54] to be a real holy roller
[1:38:57] to wake up on a sunday morning and roll
[1:38:59] over and go back to sleep
[1:39:01] you must have thought he was tempted not
[1:39:03] to pray as much as somebody else
[1:39:06] but the bible said he was tempted in all
[1:39:08] manner as we are
[1:39:10] so you think about your temptation you
[1:39:12] think about what the enemies tried to
[1:39:14] pull you into
[1:39:16] and then you will know that in every way
[1:39:18] that the enemy tried to tempt you
[1:39:21] he tried to tempt him whoa
[1:39:24] and none of it could pull him into
[1:39:26] unbelief
[1:39:27] why because he knew who he was somebody
[1:39:29] said because he was god no
[1:39:32] because he was god man
[1:39:34] but it was because he knew who he
[1:39:38] was he knew who he was he didn't have to
[1:39:41] go to church to find out who he was
[1:39:44] in fact when he went to the synagogue in
[1:39:46] luke chapter 4 the prophecy of isaiah
[1:39:48] was fulfilled
[1:39:50] because he recognized who he was by the
[1:39:52] reading of his own commission and
[1:39:54] mandate
[1:39:56] the spirit of the lord is upon me for he
[1:39:58] hath anointed me to preach
[1:40:01] he knew exactly who he was and when he
[1:40:03] went to sit down he left the rostrum by
[1:40:06] saying this day
[1:40:08] this scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[1:40:11] he knew exactly who he was
[1:40:14] he knew where he had come from
[1:40:17] he knew where he was going back to
[1:40:20] and because of that all the enemy could
[1:40:22] do was tempt him
[1:40:24] but he could not bring him into unbelief
[1:40:28] do you know what would happen in your
[1:40:29] life if you got a true and genuine
[1:40:33] revelation of who you are in christ
[1:40:37] and who christ is in you
[1:40:41] did you know that you would be able to
[1:40:43] reject every temptation that the enemy
[1:40:46] would throw in your way because you
[1:40:48] would recognize you came from god
[1:40:52] and you're going back to god
[1:40:56] and nothing that the enemy used against
[1:40:58] you would be successful
[1:41:00] brother branham said if that bride has a
[1:41:03] revelation
[1:41:05] a real revelation of who she is
[1:41:09] nothing would be able to touch her
[1:41:11] nothing would be able to stop her
[1:41:14] nothing would be able to dissuade her i
[1:41:18] dare say to that the most important
[1:41:21] thing for all of us today
[1:41:24] would be to have a revelation
[1:41:27] of who we are in christ
[1:41:31] and who christ is in
[1:41:34] us
[1:41:36] because if you recognize who he is in
[1:41:38] you you'll understand what brother
[1:41:40] greeley said this morning when he said
[1:41:42] he cannot lose his own
[1:41:44] i wonder if you're listening to me
[1:41:47] are you with me this morning
[1:41:49] i'm here to work for you
[1:41:52] i've spent all week in the word
[1:41:55] and so i'm ready
[1:41:57] but i'm here to labor for you
[1:41:59] i'm here to get this to you i can go on
[1:42:02] this has helped me this week
[1:42:04] but i want to see if i can help you
[1:42:06] he was a man and yet you couldn't put a
[1:42:09] mark on him yes sir
[1:42:11] overcome means this is what i've got to
[1:42:13] this is what i wanted to get to
[1:42:15] because the bible tells us in the book
[1:42:17] of the revelation and under the church
[1:42:19] of laodicea write these things
[1:42:21] and to him that overcometh write these
[1:42:23] things he said it also to ephesus in
[1:42:26] fact he said it to all of the seven
[1:42:28] churches of asia minor which were not
[1:42:30] only present-day churches they were also
[1:42:33] representative of ages of church entity
[1:42:36] or church history
[1:42:38] and when we understand that we know that
[1:42:41] god sent a message to the church just
[1:42:43] like he's doing today
[1:42:45] there's a message going to the church
[1:42:47] today it's on youtube it's on google
[1:42:50] it's on the internet it's in the
[1:42:52] churches of america
[1:42:55] but that's not all i'm interested in
[1:42:57] i not only want to know what he's saying
[1:42:59] to the church
[1:43:01] but i have a personal reason to find out
[1:43:04] what he's saying to the overcomer
[1:43:06] because i have a revelation that i
[1:43:14] [Music]
[1:43:16] can you pull that up how quick are you
[1:43:18] all
[1:43:19] can you pull that clip up hawk that we
[1:43:21] shared i shared it
[1:43:23] you can find it on eagle's refuge
[1:43:25] formally
[1:43:26] uh
[1:43:28] wounded believers you can find that clip
[1:43:30] let's play it
[1:43:31] why don't i save myself
[1:43:35] why don't i save my breath why don't i
[1:43:38] let him preach it from two years ago
[1:43:43] and then we'll go on
[1:43:47] isn't he good
[1:43:49] all the time
[1:43:51] overcome i'll keep reading it although
[1:43:53] you won't be able to see it up there
[1:43:54] paragraph 105 overcome means
[1:43:58] to recognize the devil
[1:44:01] in every one of his tricks
[1:44:03] did you know that every time he comes to
[1:44:06] you with a trick if you could recognize
[1:44:08] that
[1:44:10] you would rip his success right out of
[1:44:12] his hot hands
[1:44:14] he would not be able to be successful in
[1:44:17] anything he wanted to use against you
[1:44:19] because you'd be there saying aha
[1:44:22] that's a trick
[1:44:24] aha that's the enemy trying to disturb
[1:44:26] my peace come on aha that's the enemy
[1:44:29] trying to distract me in this last hour
[1:44:31] and if you were able to do that every
[1:44:33] single time there's nothing that you
[1:44:36] wouldn't be able to overcome
[1:44:38] i want you to know overcome is not just
[1:44:39] an action
[1:44:41] overcoming is an identity
[1:44:43] i am identified as an overcomer even
[1:44:46] when my thinking is not overcoming
[1:44:48] thinking
[1:44:50] hallelujah
[1:44:52] are you all getting any closer there we
[1:44:54] go
[1:44:55] there we go
[1:44:58] right there
[1:45:01] i have arrived
[1:45:03] i can just sit back let me let me preach
[1:45:06] on video
[1:45:11] i went back and watched this myself
[1:45:13] got blessed
[1:45:25] in the house listen
[1:45:28] [Music]
[1:45:31] you don't have to make another miserable
[1:45:33] trip around the mountain
[1:45:35] you can catch yourself i can catch
[1:45:38] myself in this hour and i can say lord i
[1:45:42] don't need much more squeezing i just
[1:45:45] need a whole lot more surrender
[1:45:47] sometimes we just need to take our hands
[1:45:50] off and say god do whatever you need to
[1:45:53] do to bring me
[1:45:57] [Music]
[1:45:58] i could never pray a prayer like that
[1:46:00] you say well why is that is it because
[1:46:03] you don't trust him
[1:46:05] maybe you
[1:46:07] wonder what he's out for yeah
[1:46:10] maybe you wonder what god's motive is
[1:46:14] for putting his finger in your business
[1:46:18] i'll tell you why
[1:46:20] because you were chosen to be an
[1:46:22] overcomer i am
[1:46:24] you
[1:46:28] i am
[1:46:30] because overcoming is a calling
[1:46:33] i am cold as an overcomer
[1:46:37] i'm that i am an overcomer
[1:46:41] when i'm drowning i'm an overcomer
[1:46:44] when i'm coming up the rough side of the
[1:46:46] mountain and barely making a half an
[1:46:49] inch i'm still an
[1:46:53] the overcomer
[1:46:54] quickening power
[1:46:57] lives inside of the believer
[1:47:01] when i feel defeated i am still an
[1:47:05] overcomer
[1:47:07] when i think like a defeated man i'm
[1:47:10] still an overcomer
[1:47:13] so i need the spirit of god to draw me
[1:47:17] back
[1:47:18] [Music]
[1:47:19] into my calling
[1:47:21] but we must not resist the discipline of
[1:47:25] the lord yes
[1:47:27] and we must receive it with the right
[1:47:30] spirit
[1:47:32] one that glorifies
[1:47:34] god yes yes against all odds come on
[1:47:39] one that looses a testimony among the
[1:47:43] brethren yes among the people of god ah
[1:47:46] this has nearly destroyed me
[1:47:50] but it has not been able to steal my
[1:47:54] praise
[1:47:56] this is the most glorious testimony of
[1:48:00] the overcomer
[1:48:02] it's the testimony of paul and silas
[1:48:07] and many others through the book
[1:48:10] that when it looked like they couldn't
[1:48:13] get over it
[1:48:15] he somehow
[1:48:16] strengthened them
[1:48:18] and they embraced
[1:48:21] the good love the sweet love
[1:48:24] the seeker sensitive love
[1:48:26] and they also embraced
[1:48:30] the tough love of the lord
[1:48:34] anybody ever had to embrace the tough
[1:48:36] love of the lord
[1:48:38] let's praise god
[1:48:40] he loves us
[1:48:44] i am an overcomer
[1:48:48] my friend drew said i am
[1:48:51] he said i am i am
[1:48:53] an overcomer and you are brother you are
[1:48:56] you absolutely are
[1:48:58] now in paragraph 105 he said overcome
[1:49:01] means to recognize the devil in every
[1:49:04] one of his tricks
[1:49:05] he said a lot of people says there's no
[1:49:07] devil it's just a thought don't you
[1:49:09] believe that there's a real devil he's
[1:49:11] just as real as you are or anybody a
[1:49:13] real devil and you must recognize him
[1:49:15] real
[1:49:16] don't underestimate the enemy
[1:49:19] but don't fear him either
[1:49:21] he said you must know he's a devil then
[1:49:23] the same time that you recognize him and
[1:49:25] know that he's a devil and he's against
[1:49:26] you then to overcome you must recognize
[1:49:30] that the god in you
[1:49:32] don't that sound easy
[1:49:36] it sounds so easy
[1:49:38] and yet we get spiritual amnesia when we
[1:49:42] need to know it the most
[1:49:44] when we're going through something he
[1:49:47] said you must recognize that the god in
[1:49:50] you is greater and mightier than he is
[1:49:54] the enemy
[1:49:55] that the one that's in you has already
[1:50:00] overcome him
[1:50:02] can you say amen
[1:50:05] already overcome
[1:50:08] him and by his grace
[1:50:11] you are you read it for me
[1:50:17] amen
[1:50:19] why because the overcomer lives in me
[1:50:23] because my identity is with my overcomer
[1:50:27] and he lives in me and because he lives
[1:50:30] in me that makes me more than a match
[1:50:32] for the enemy
[1:50:33] somebody said i think that's a little
[1:50:35] boastful to say we're not boasting on us
[1:50:38] we're boasting on the god that lives
[1:50:40] inside of us
[1:50:41] how could a dad get up and say the
[1:50:43] things he said yesterday
[1:50:46] over the the bodies
[1:50:48] were not there because there's still an
[1:50:50] autopsy going on and an investigation
[1:50:53] going on and just a few days after
[1:50:55] losing a dear son 23 years old and yet
[1:50:58] he can stand up and speak of his faith
[1:51:01] as an overcomer because he knows who he
[1:51:05] is in god and he knows who christ is in
[1:51:08] him and he knows that nothing is going
[1:51:10] to happen in their life that god will
[1:51:12] not help him get through when you know
[1:51:15] that you're an overcomer when you
[1:51:17] recognize the enemy on all of his tricks
[1:51:21] every one of them
[1:51:23] you are
[1:51:25] an overcomer
[1:51:26] are you still with me
[1:51:28] in the message of total deliverance
[1:51:31] paragraph 53 i want to share this with
[1:51:34] you before we move move on a little bit
[1:51:36] are you still here i know i keep asking
[1:51:38] you that because i want to know it
[1:51:40] he said and the member of the church
[1:51:42] he's called to be a member of a certain
[1:51:44] group then he would not compromise if
[1:51:47] the church believes that we should not
[1:51:49] gamble then that member should never
[1:51:51] touch a deck of cards and i agree with
[1:51:54] the prophet right there
[1:51:55] he said we don't believe in drinking he
[1:51:57] should turn his head completely
[1:52:04] he shouldn't be a sipping saint
[1:52:07] he should make a total stand
[1:52:10] a total separation from unbelief
[1:52:14] and that means not twisting scripture
[1:52:19] you certainly don't have a continual
[1:52:21] stomach ailment
[1:52:26] when you hear people say i drink a
[1:52:27] little wine to relax i want to tell you
[1:52:29] something right now it's a slippery
[1:52:31] slope
[1:52:33] i don't care whether folks amen that or
[1:52:35] not it's nothing but the truth
[1:52:38] if any of you have dealt with family
[1:52:40] members who are alcoholics you have no
[1:52:43] tolerance
[1:52:44] i have no tolerance for sipping saints
[1:52:48] you've got to get all the way away from
[1:52:51] that unbelief
[1:52:53] stand away from it get away from it he
[1:52:56] said if you do not believe in gambling
[1:52:58] or smoking the member of this church
[1:53:00] should never touch such a thing
[1:53:02] and i want you to hear this sentence
[1:53:04] because this stands against a lot of
[1:53:06] people's idea
[1:53:07] god
[1:53:09] gives
[1:53:12] you can have it
[1:53:13] i want you to look at your neighbor and
[1:53:15] say you can have complete deliverance
[1:53:18] yes
[1:53:20] over what everything
[1:53:23] everything
[1:53:25] whatever the enemy tries to hold you
[1:53:28] with you can have complete and total
[1:53:32] deliverance over that because greater is
[1:53:34] he that is in you than he that is in the
[1:53:36] world
[1:53:38] you can have complete deliverance
[1:53:39] because god gives it he said he will do
[1:53:43] it
[1:53:44] if we'll
[1:53:48] there it is completely surrender you
[1:53:50] can't be fighting for your rights
[1:53:52] brother
[1:53:54] and completely surrendered to him at the
[1:53:57] same time
[1:53:59] you know in all of this protesting and
[1:54:01] all of this thing we went through in the
[1:54:03] last few years in our nation where
[1:54:05] everybody is fighting for their rights
[1:54:08] did you know that's the very spirit of
[1:54:09] laodicea that's part of what laodicea
[1:54:12] means
[1:54:13] it means the age of people's rights
[1:54:17] and so you've got people fighting over
[1:54:19] this we have rights we have rights we
[1:54:23] demand our rights
[1:54:26] it's a spirit of the age
[1:54:28] and it's the very opposite of what
[1:54:30] brings us to total deliverance
[1:54:33] total deliverance is requ separation and
[1:54:35] surrender is required to walk in
[1:54:38] complete and total deliverance which
[1:54:40] means we say lord i surrender all my
[1:54:42] rights and all my privileges and all the
[1:54:44] things i think i'm entitled to i
[1:54:46] surrender all of that to you now you
[1:54:50] come and have your way in my life
[1:54:52] if we will completely deliver ourselves
[1:54:55] into his hand
[1:54:58] then god can live in us christ
[1:55:03] are you there
[1:55:04] christ
[1:55:06] the hope of glory
[1:55:07] he can reflect himself from us as we get
[1:55:10] ourselves out of the way then our
[1:55:12] thoughts
[1:55:14] is this sounding good to anybody then
[1:55:16] our thoughts are his thoughts
[1:55:19] could you imagine christ smoking a cigar
[1:55:27] the reapers live right up the street
[1:55:29] from a place where they have humidors
[1:55:35] where the speakers who come through they
[1:55:38] can go and take something out of the
[1:55:39] humidor
[1:55:42] that's how far the church has fallen in
[1:55:46] this hour
[1:55:49] he said can you imagine christ smoking a
[1:55:51] cigar could you imagine drinking or
[1:55:53] playing cards christ sitting around
[1:55:55] doing that then if your spirit is part
[1:55:58] of his
[1:55:58] spirit he wants it to be upon your
[1:56:01] confession
[1:56:03] but you permit the devil to come in and
[1:56:05] take over and all the time in your heart
[1:56:07] way down deep you know
[1:56:09] you're wrong
[1:56:11] when you do those things
[1:56:13] most people know
[1:56:15] most people know and the way they combat
[1:56:17] it is to say that the teaching against
[1:56:20] it is legalism and preaching against it
[1:56:22] is religious and religion and so forth
[1:56:25] we don't fall for that kind of garbage
[1:56:28] said when one member would talk against
[1:56:29] the other member you know that's wrong
[1:56:32] it's not just smoking it's not just
[1:56:34] drinking it's not just these other
[1:56:35] things that are attributes of unbelief
[1:56:37] talking about one another it's an
[1:56:39] attribute of unbelief
[1:56:41] when there's no purpose in it when
[1:56:43] there's no healing at the end of it when
[1:56:46] there's no hope for the person when
[1:56:48] you're done
[1:56:50] he said you're commanded to pray for one
[1:56:52] another not to talk against one another
[1:56:54] but to what
[1:56:55] and if someone is down do what
[1:56:58] let's pick him up and help him
[1:57:00] they sure need it and we need to be
[1:57:02] there and available to help he said now
[1:57:04] that makes us a unified group of
[1:57:06] believers now when we don't obey that
[1:57:08] then we don't obey god we displease god
[1:57:11] and therefore our church our people
[1:57:14] cannot prosper the church cannot go on
[1:57:17] it's because we are disunified together
[1:57:20] imagine being disunified together
[1:57:23] as jesus said a little what 11 11 if the
[1:57:26] whole lump
[1:57:28] now i want you to turn in your bible if
[1:57:30] you have it they'll have it soon on the
[1:57:32] screen to revelation chapter 4 verse 1.
[1:57:35] we're still talking about total
[1:57:37] deliverance and you may remember that
[1:57:39] total deliverance or the year of the
[1:57:41] lord's favor as isaiah prophesied we
[1:57:44] mentioned it just a moment ago it is
[1:57:47] associated with a trumpet
[1:57:51] are you here
[1:57:53] a silver trumpet
[1:57:55] just like this one
[1:57:59] this was the sound
[1:58:02] this was the horn
[1:58:04] that sounded the jubilee
[1:58:07] and in that 50th year
[1:58:10] of jubilee every slave
[1:58:13] every indentured servant
[1:58:16] everyone who was slaving to pay off a
[1:58:19] debt
[1:58:20] on that 50th year at the sound of the
[1:58:23] jubilee trumpet they were free
[1:58:28] it didn't matter if there was 50 left on
[1:58:31] the debt
[1:58:34] or fifty thousand dollars left on the
[1:58:36] dead
[1:58:37] oh ain't that good
[1:58:38] but when that jubilee trumpet sounded
[1:58:41] you could drop your hole
[1:58:44] your working was over
[1:58:47] your slave was over
[1:58:49] you were free
[1:58:51] you could just walk right out of the
[1:58:52] field praising god for the sound of the
[1:58:54] jubilee trumpet
[1:58:56] now i won't associate that trumpet with
[1:58:57] the revelation 4 1 trumpet he said after
[1:59:00] this i looked and behold a door
[1:59:04] was opened in heaven
[1:59:10] that reminds me of
[1:59:13] many years ago
[1:59:15] when we were having a very spiritual
[1:59:17] night
[1:59:18] in our home
[1:59:20] a spiritual trespasser
[1:59:23] had showed up in our home that night
[1:59:26] and had to be dealt with in a rather
[1:59:28] harsh way
[1:59:30] before or or maybe after but i think it
[1:59:32] was before that
[1:59:33] there was a sound
[1:59:35] that went through our house
[1:59:38] and it sounded like a wind
[1:59:42] rushing through the house
[1:59:44] down the hall and
[1:59:46] out toward the living room and
[1:59:48] olivia was just a little girl then the
[1:59:50] one who was up here singing if you
[1:59:52] didn't know
[1:59:53] and she cried out and she said the door
[1:59:57] is open
[1:59:59] she's sound asleep
[2:00:02] the door is open
[2:00:06] that's part of what
[2:00:08] brought me to full attention
[2:00:10] and helped me to recognize what had
[2:00:12] invaded our home
[2:00:14] and had to be dealt with
[2:00:16] and it reminded me immediately of
[2:00:19] revelation 4 1 because that's where
[2:00:21] we've been preaching
[2:00:22] it says after this i looked and behold a
[2:00:24] door was opened in heaven and the first
[2:00:27] voice which i heard was as it were of a
[2:00:32] trumpet talking
[2:00:34] with me
[2:00:37] now this trumpet
[2:00:39] it's a voice
[2:00:41] but it sounds with such authority
[2:00:45] that it is associated with the blast of
[2:00:49] a trumpet
[2:00:50] are you getting that
[2:00:52] he said a voice a trumpet
[2:00:55] i heard
[2:00:58] as it were of a trumpet talking with me
[2:01:03] you know trumpets don't talk
[2:01:05] they sound a note and it's a loud note
[2:01:09] it's a blaring note
[2:01:11] but this was a voice and a message
[2:01:15] and the message was of such authority
[2:01:18] that it sounded like a trumpet sounding
[2:01:21] so the voice is a voice of jubilee
[2:01:26] the voice of jubilee is saying to john i
[2:01:30] i've opened the door for you john
[2:01:33] and now i want you to come up hither
[2:01:38] the door is open john i want you to come
[2:01:41] up higher i want you to come up hither
[2:01:45] and i will show the things which must be
[2:01:50] hereafter
[2:01:52] how many of you know that is the rapture
[2:01:55] the total fulfillment of revelation 4 1
[2:01:59] is the rapture resurrection that's what
[2:02:01] it is
[2:02:02] the prophet tells us that you don't read
[2:02:05] any more about the church
[2:02:07] you've just gone through the church ages
[2:02:09] in revelation chapter 2 and chapter 3
[2:02:12] and then he tells us that the rapture is
[2:02:14] taking place here this is where it's
[2:02:16] placed in the revelation chronologically
[2:02:19] is revelation 4 1 he said you don't have
[2:02:22] any you don't have the church appearing
[2:02:24] anymore
[2:02:25] until revelation 19
[2:02:28] so the church leaves in revelation 4 the
[2:02:31] church returns with christ
[2:02:34] in revelation 19.
[2:02:37] come on now
[2:02:38] why is that so important because jubilee
[2:02:41] and the voice of jubilee is also
[2:02:44] identified with the resurrection
[2:02:48] the dead coming back to life
[2:02:50] how many of you know there's a spiritual
[2:02:52] resurrection needed in our lives
[2:02:55] before we look for a physical did you
[2:02:57] know deliverance is a resurrection
[2:03:00] did you know death will set in
[2:03:03] spiritually in your life until you can
[2:03:06] have no victory in christ
[2:03:09] you can't overcome anything
[2:03:11] because you are in a state of spiritual
[2:03:14] death you're just
[2:03:16] a a form
[2:03:18] you are just a shell
[2:03:20] you are empty because you have allowed
[2:03:22] unbelief to so take control of your life
[2:03:26] that that almost like your nature you
[2:03:28] just pick up the things and you just
[2:03:30] participate in the thing say things and
[2:03:32] do things that you know better than
[2:03:34] doing but you're just all occupied with
[2:03:37] the things of this world you need a
[2:03:39] resurrection
[2:03:41] death is trying to set in in your spirit
[2:03:43] man come on and when that voice of
[2:03:45] resurrection sounds and when the voice
[2:03:48] of authority sounds like a trumpet and
[2:03:50] says get up here
[2:03:53] i would to god every one of us would
[2:03:54] hear that today get up here
[2:03:57] what are you doing down there worrying
[2:04:00] about all that nothing
[2:04:03] get up here where i am
[2:04:06] i want to talk to you
[2:04:08] i want to tell you some things that have
[2:04:11] not yet been made personal to you in
[2:04:13] your life with a revelation i want you
[2:04:16] to hear some things in the message the
[2:04:18] feast of trumpets paragraph 135
[2:04:22] he says this now notice the trumpets
[2:04:25] that we're speaking of is a call
[2:04:28] together
[2:04:29] for either a feast
[2:04:32] for war
[2:04:33] for a person
[2:04:35] some sacred day or something like that
[2:04:39] notice you say for a person
[2:04:41] yeah or for the year of jubilee
[2:04:45] the announcing
[2:04:47] of the coming of freedom
[2:04:50] lord have mercy i feel like the holy
[2:04:53] ghost is trying to announce to us that
[2:04:56] the freedom that you've been looking for
[2:04:59] and the deliverance that you've been
[2:05:00] seeking is just around the corner if you
[2:05:04] can just keep holding on and quit giving
[2:05:07] in to death and start reaching for life
[2:05:10] if you could just rise up today and deal
[2:05:13] with the unbelief
[2:05:15] the residual unbelief that remains in
[2:05:18] your life if you could deal with it i've
[2:05:20] got a feeling that the announcing of the
[2:05:23] coming of freedom hallelujah is
[2:05:25] happening in our midst he said when they
[2:05:27] could go back now we could take a
[2:05:29] complete mourning on just that one thing
[2:05:32] but now getting into the trumpets
[2:05:35] he said you got the background now of
[2:05:37] the seals and the church
[2:05:39] now we're going into the trumpet
[2:05:42] the trumpet sounded
[2:05:44] and the trumpet denotes either war
[2:05:47] or a feast day
[2:05:48] or what it means is a gathering together
[2:05:52] of the people how many of you want to be
[2:05:54] gathered with the jubilee voice
[2:05:57] not a voice that binds us
[2:06:01] not a voice that keeps us in our
[2:06:02] denominational creed
[2:06:05] but a voice hold it up alias hold it up
[2:06:08] a voice that calls us back to the
[2:06:11] absolute
[2:06:13] that's the jubilee
[2:06:14] voice you've got to make it fit the word
[2:06:19] if your life will not fit the word you
[2:06:22] need a different life
[2:06:24] if your lifestyle won't line up with the
[2:06:27] absolute word of god you need another
[2:06:29] lifestyle if your habit or your hobby
[2:06:32] will not line up with the word of god
[2:06:34] you need a different one
[2:06:37] because that is our absolute
[2:06:39] he said now what it means is the
[2:06:41] gathering together the people the
[2:06:42] trumpet let's read on
[2:06:45] paul said
[2:06:47] when the trumpet gives an uncertain
[2:06:50] sound god help us
[2:06:52] who can prepare themselves for war or
[2:06:56] for peace or whatever it is how would
[2:06:58] you like to go to battle with a pitiful
[2:07:01] trumpet player
[2:07:05] one that didn't know the difference
[2:07:06] between between waking you up and
[2:07:09] putting you to sleep
[2:07:11] one that didn't know the difference
[2:07:12] between reveling taps
[2:07:16] you didn't know whether you're supposed
[2:07:17] to be waking up in the morning or going
[2:07:19] to bed
[2:07:20] or laying down in the grave
[2:07:23] what would you do if your leader
[2:07:25] did not give you a clear
[2:07:28] message
[2:07:29] one that you could follow
[2:07:32] listen the days of ambiguous messages
[2:07:34] and unclear messages it's over now
[2:07:37] the word is
[2:07:38] open somebody say amen
[2:07:41] it's no longer a sealed book to the
[2:07:44] bride of christ
[2:07:46] oh that book that was sealed in
[2:07:48] revelation chapter 5 we don't see that
[2:07:50] book again until revelation chapter 10
[2:07:53] in revelation chapter 10 we see a mighty
[2:07:55] angel coming down from god out of heaven
[2:07:58] with a book opened in his hand
[2:08:02] what book same book you saw closed in
[2:08:03] revelation 5. when a search was made
[2:08:06] hallelujah who's worthy to take the book
[2:08:08] and open the seals thereof and a voice a
[2:08:11] one one a lion a lion of the tribe of
[2:08:14] judah hath prevailed to take the book
[2:08:16] and loose the seals thereof and while
[2:08:18] they're bracing themselves in heaven for
[2:08:20] a lion to come walking out the bible
[2:08:22] said from the midst of the throne there
[2:08:23] came a lamb
[2:08:26] it's a glorious mystery
[2:08:28] the lion is a lamb
[2:08:34] because in order for you to walk in
[2:08:36] overcoming victory like the lion
[2:08:38] you have to understand that your lamb is
[2:08:40] a perfect sacrifice
[2:08:44] i want you to know there were no perfect
[2:08:46] worshipers in the tabernacle there were
[2:08:48] no perfect worshipers in the temple
[2:08:50] there's not going to be any perfect
[2:08:51] worshippers in here
[2:08:55] so you got to make sure your sacrifice
[2:08:57] is perfect
[2:08:58] you've got to make sure your offering is
[2:09:00] perfect and i want you to know jesus is
[2:09:03] how many of you know he's the lamb of
[2:09:04] glory he's the lamb of glory
[2:09:07] [Music]
[2:09:10] he's perfect
[2:09:11] let's read on paragraph 136 paul said
[2:09:14] when the trumpet gives an uncertain
[2:09:16] sound who can prepare themselves for war
[2:09:17] for peace or whatever it is who knows
[2:09:19] you have to know what the trumpet sounds
[2:09:21] therefore when the trumpet sounds we see
[2:09:23] something in the earth today there is a
[2:09:25] great trouble somewhere everybody knows
[2:09:28] it everybody has become neurotic
[2:09:34] if that was true in 64 what do you think
[2:09:36] it is in 2022
[2:09:40] you say a little something they don't
[2:09:42] like canceled
[2:09:45] you never existed
[2:09:48] well there's never been such a day
[2:09:49] they'll throw their favorite actor
[2:09:52] they used to would die for their pop
[2:09:54] singers
[2:09:56] they used to die for their stars
[2:09:58] now you just let their star say one
[2:10:00] thing they don't believe and they cancel
[2:10:02] them
[2:10:03] it says so they never existed because
[2:10:05] the world around us is getting more
[2:10:07] neurotic every day
[2:10:08] he said the whole world is a neurotical
[2:10:10] world and we know there's something
[2:10:11] wrong the pentagon everywhere
[2:10:14] we know there's something wrong yes we
[2:10:15] do
[2:10:16] he said now the only way you'll know
[2:10:17] what the trumpet sound is is to look
[2:10:19] what the sheet music says
[2:10:22] what the music sheet says hold it up
[2:10:24] again there
[2:10:26] there's the sheet music
[2:10:28] anybody with me
[2:10:30] you don't get to write that as you go
[2:10:31] along
[2:10:32] that's your absolute
[2:10:34] and if one person tries to come and tell
[2:10:36] me it don't mean that i don't care what
[2:10:38] you think it means
[2:10:40] i'm depending on the holy ghost to
[2:10:42] interpret the word
[2:10:44] we don't need man's opinions to tell us
[2:10:46] what the word means
[2:10:47] we've got the holy ghost to do that when
[2:10:49] he the spirit of truth is come he will
[2:10:51] lead you
[2:10:52] [Applause]
[2:10:55] you'll leave the rest behind
[2:10:57] you'll leave your church entity behind
[2:11:00] you'll leave your favorite preacher
[2:11:01] behind
[2:11:02] once you hear the jubilee voice
[2:11:05] calling you back to the
[2:11:08] word calling you out of slavery into
[2:11:12] sonship
[2:11:14] that's it
[2:11:15] he said that's all it's a great symphony
[2:11:17] sea and beating
[2:11:18] yes beating
[2:11:23] there's a cadence in the spirit
[2:11:25] did you hear me
[2:11:27] there's a cadence in the spirit and some
[2:11:29] people never hit it
[2:11:35] you you ought to try to catch the spirit
[2:11:37] behind the song
[2:11:42] you can sing the song
[2:11:44] and you can deliver it better than the
[2:11:46] one who wrote it as far as quality and
[2:11:48] style and
[2:11:50] and pitch
[2:11:51] and tone of voice
[2:11:53] but until you have touched the spirit of
[2:11:55] a song the inspiration that a song was
[2:11:58] written in
[2:12:00] did you know we have found out that
[2:12:01] sometimes the holy ghost will take a
[2:12:03] song to a new
[2:12:04] inspiration take it to a higher place
[2:12:07] than the composer wrote it
[2:12:11] somebody said well look what happened
[2:12:13] down there in australia what happened in
[2:12:15] the in the hill song what happened in
[2:12:17] that group so we throw all that away we
[2:12:19] throw all those songs away let me tell
[2:12:20] you something
[2:12:22] i don't have to do such a thing as that
[2:12:23] i can discern we can work through
[2:12:25] something and find out if there's
[2:12:27] something we need to get rid of or not
[2:12:28] but i want you to know the holy ghost
[2:12:30] can take a song to a higher
[2:12:32] inspiration than the one who wrote it
[2:12:34] how can that be possible because the
[2:12:36] bible said that the gift of the that the
[2:12:38] gifts are without repentance the
[2:12:40] callings and gifts of god are without
[2:12:41] repentance so there's people under a
[2:12:43] wrong anointing writing songs that god
[2:12:45] can use for his glory we just have to
[2:12:47] pull them out and redeem them
[2:12:48] [Music]
[2:12:52] somebody said i went to your church for
[2:12:53] the shell and you all sung the truth is
[2:12:55] marching on and it offended me
[2:13:00] well obviously the only reason why i did
[2:13:02] is he was on the wrong side of the war
[2:13:06] that's not what we're singing about
[2:13:10] you see well that's what it was written
[2:13:12] about i don't care what it was written
[2:13:14] about we're taking that song to a higher
[2:13:16] level
[2:13:18] mine eyes have seen the glory
[2:13:22] of the coming of the lord come on
[2:13:26] god's truth is marching
[2:13:30] on
[2:13:33] glory glory hallelujah
[2:13:39] glory glory hallelujah
[2:13:45] glory glory hallelujah
[2:13:50] his truth is
[2:13:53] marching
[2:13:54] on
[2:13:56] if that's if that song makes you want to
[2:13:58] go re-fight the civil war you're under
[2:14:00] the wrong spirit
[2:14:05] if that song anoints you to be
[2:14:07] prejudiced against somebody because of
[2:14:09] their race you're under the wrong spirit
[2:14:13] honey this has nothing to do with black
[2:14:15] or white or yellow or polka dot or any
[2:14:18] other no sir
[2:14:21] we're talking about a higher truth
[2:14:24] so you just sing a song like that
[2:14:25] written under the under the effect of
[2:14:27] war and you get all twisted up and upset
[2:14:30] about something like that you're missing
[2:14:31] it
[2:14:32] because if i've ever told the truth i'm
[2:14:34] telling you now god's truth is marching
[2:14:36] on it doesn't stand still for anybody
[2:14:39] he doesn't stand still for any church
[2:14:41] any dogma any creed
[2:14:45] god's truth just gets higher and higher
[2:14:47] and higher as a jubilee voice says get
[2:14:50] up here
[2:14:52] get up here
[2:14:54] [Applause]
[2:14:57] it's a great symphony sea and beating
[2:15:01] like peter and the wolf
[2:15:04] how many of you have ever heard the
[2:15:05] symphony of peter the wolf
[2:15:07] what what a piece of music
[2:15:11] the composers wrote the book director
[2:15:13] must be in the same spirit of the
[2:15:14] composer
[2:15:18] when he wrote it he knew how he wanted
[2:15:20] to sound
[2:15:22] he knew how he wanted one instrument to
[2:15:24] be louder than the other
[2:15:25] boy you have that you have a hard time
[2:15:27] with that sometimes because everybody
[2:15:28] wants to be the loudest
[2:15:29] so you get a bunch of musicians together
[2:15:31] and everybody just wants to play the
[2:15:32] loudest
[2:15:35] why is it so quiet
[2:15:36] i'm not talking about our musicians but
[2:15:38] if i if they're guilty i am
[2:15:43] but i wasn't referring to them but i've
[2:15:45] i've been
[2:15:46] in groups of people we've had them here
[2:15:50] they didn't care whether you could hear
[2:15:51] the piano or not
[2:15:53] but they marched up to the sound booth
[2:15:55] to say i need more on my guitar
[2:15:58] let me tell you something you're not
[2:16:00] here to be the star of the show
[2:16:02] you're here to flow in the spirit
[2:16:07] there's times i hear the drums
[2:16:09] prophesying
[2:16:11] and there's times i want the drums to be
[2:16:13] a little more quiet than they are
[2:16:15] sometimes i hear the bass prophesying
[2:16:18] and sometimes all i hear is thump thump
[2:16:20] thump
[2:16:23] you see the the one who is directing
[2:16:26] this thing has to be in the same
[2:16:27] inspiration as the one who wrote the
[2:16:29] piece of music he has to be in the same
[2:16:31] spirit of the composer if he don't he
[2:16:33] gives the wrong beat
[2:16:39] you know i know people that are just
[2:16:40] sing a whole song in the wrong tempo
[2:16:43] i can't always do that sometimes i do it
[2:16:45] for the sake of
[2:16:47] of community
[2:16:49] but sometimes i say what
[2:16:52] i know it hurts the anointing i know i
[2:16:53] know it i know it causes people to be
[2:16:55] shocked but sometimes you say whoop
[2:16:58] that's not the right tempo let's get the
[2:16:59] right tempo here
[2:17:01] sometimes we're blaming the drum when it
[2:17:03] ain't the drum
[2:17:05] sometimes we're the ones out of the
[2:17:07] tempo
[2:17:08] uh singers can get quite out of rhythm
[2:17:10] too sometime let us say amen
[2:17:13] we're not just talking about natural
[2:17:15] here kind of we're talking natural now
[2:17:16] but i'm talking about something more
[2:17:18] spiritual than this
[2:17:20] you know we had a service not too long
[2:17:22] ago where there was something off in the
[2:17:24] music and there was a sound that was off
[2:17:26] and we had to stop the service and kind
[2:17:27] of pray a little bit to try to get back
[2:17:29] above that
[2:17:32] why because every now and then heaven's
[2:17:34] music breaks down into the earth and we
[2:17:36] begin to realize what's happening in a
[2:17:39] higher realm and a sound that's coming
[2:17:40] out of a higher dimension than the one
[2:17:42] we live in listen praise and worship is
[2:17:44] a vital in part a vital vital part very
[2:17:47] very important part to what we're doing
[2:17:49] here
[2:17:50] i know the word must take preeminence
[2:17:52] but the word must come forth in the
[2:17:54] right atmosphere and the atmosphere is
[2:17:56] not created by the word the atmosphere
[2:17:58] it's created by the anointing and the
[2:18:00] anointing is drawn in by the praise and
[2:18:02] the worship
[2:18:05] if you don't give the right the wrong
[2:18:06] beat there the whole thing gets out
[2:18:08] let's go on
[2:18:10] 140. that's what's the matter today we
[2:18:12] got too many directors
[2:18:17] i sure could sister man that'll preach
[2:18:20] right there
[2:18:22] got too many directors
[2:18:25] too many trying to take care of business
[2:18:29] instead of letting the one that's
[2:18:30] appointed to take care of the business
[2:18:32] take care of the business
[2:18:39] now just for instance when we come to a
[2:18:40] worship service the one leading the
[2:18:42] worship is in charge
[2:18:44] that means the instruments follow that
[2:18:46] lead
[2:18:47] you're not to lead worship from the
[2:18:49] guitar
[2:18:50] meaning you let the guitar lead the
[2:18:52] worship
[2:18:53] come on
[2:18:55] you decide how it ought to be
[2:18:57] i remember here some beautiful girls
[2:18:59] wanted to sing a song one time and they
[2:19:01] couldn't sing it because it wasn't the
[2:19:02] preference of a family member
[2:19:05] and so they couldn't sing the song and
[2:19:06] i'm thinking to myself would you really
[2:19:08] cheat us
[2:19:10] would you cheat us out of the gift would
[2:19:12] you cheat us out of being able to hear
[2:19:14] what we might could have heard and been
[2:19:16] blessed by
[2:19:18] because you've got a preference here and
[2:19:20] if the thing was ungodly or unworldly we
[2:19:22] didn't want it anyway
[2:19:24] but i don't think it was in the first
[2:19:26] place
[2:19:27] but if somebody can't be in control
[2:19:29] sometime they want to just put a big
[2:19:32] bushel barrel over everything just hold
[2:19:34] it all back i don't want to hold
[2:19:36] anything back i want it to fly
[2:19:38] hallelujah i want the service to fly
[2:19:42] i want every one of us to get in the
[2:19:44] spirit of the composer
[2:19:47] they say the denomination well we
[2:19:48] believe this
[2:19:50] no matter what you say the bible's right
[2:19:52] beat it out according to the sheep music
[2:19:54] right here hold it up again elias
[2:19:56] beat it out according to the sheep music
[2:19:58] right here before it
[2:20:00] then the great symphony of god's great
[2:20:03] act is playing out
[2:20:05] just right then we can see the hour and
[2:20:07] where we're standing thank you brother
[2:20:09] hallelujah
[2:20:11] now notice the trumpet is to call
[2:20:12] together the people assemble themselves
[2:20:14] together for something sometime it
[2:20:16] announced an important person
[2:20:18] are you still here
[2:20:20] sometimes it did
[2:20:22] now i want you to uh
[2:20:25] i want you to give me this day the
[2:20:26] scriptures fulfilled this is the last
[2:20:28] one in that and then we're moving on
[2:20:29] just stay with me a little longer we're
[2:20:31] still here
[2:20:32] still doing good not out of time yet
[2:20:35] the acceptable year as we all know
[2:20:38] as the bible readers was the year of
[2:20:40] jubilee that's when all slaves and
[2:20:42] prisoners as they were were taken prison
[2:20:44] and had had to give a son to pay a debt
[2:20:47] or a daughter to pay a debt
[2:20:49] and they were in bondage
[2:20:52] no matter how long they had been in
[2:20:53] bondage or how long they are supposed to
[2:20:55] stay there when the year come of the
[2:20:57] jubilee when the trumpet sounded every
[2:21:00] man could go free if he wanted to go
[2:21:02] free
[2:21:03] that's a good question
[2:21:05] do you want to go free
[2:21:07] are you interested in freedom are you
[2:21:09] interested in complete deliverance then
[2:21:12] you must recognize the sound of the
[2:21:14] jubilee voice
[2:21:16] you must place yourself under that
[2:21:18] inspiration
[2:21:19] come on that's what that's the quotes we
[2:21:21] read when we started this series
[2:21:23] said you've got to get under that
[2:21:26] when the year come of the jubilee when
[2:21:28] the trumpet sounded every man could go
[2:21:29] free you're free
[2:21:31] he was no more slave
[2:21:32] but if you desired to remain a slave
[2:21:37] if you desired to remain a slave you'd
[2:21:39] have to be taken down to the temple
[2:21:41] stood by the temple post and they took
[2:21:43] an aw
[2:21:45] and bored a hole in your ear
[2:21:48] that's why my preference is i don't like
[2:21:50] these holes in women's ears i don't like
[2:21:52] that my preference i don't like that
[2:21:55] because i understand the history of
[2:21:56] where this come from goes all the way
[2:21:58] back to the bible
[2:22:00] and if somebody said no i'm not going
[2:22:02] free i love i love this master
[2:22:04] i'm just going to serve the one i've
[2:22:06] been serving that don't sound right to
[2:22:08] me
[2:22:09] i'm just going to serve the one i've
[2:22:10] been serving so then they took them down
[2:22:11] stood by the temple post they took an
[2:22:13] owl and bored a hole in your ear then
[2:22:16] you had to serve that slave master the
[2:22:17] rest of your days if you studied this
[2:22:19] history of it they put a ring in there
[2:22:22] and then you have to serve that slave
[2:22:24] master the rest of your days
[2:22:26] he said what a perfect example it is of
[2:22:28] the gospel of jesus christ how is that
[2:22:31] how is that he said when it's preached
[2:22:33] the acceptable time and the time of
[2:22:34] jubilee anybody no matter who you are
[2:22:37] what color you are what denomination you
[2:22:39] belong to how how it's far you stooped
[2:22:41] in sin or what's wrong with you you can
[2:22:44] go free when you hear the gospel trumpet
[2:22:47] sound out there you are
[2:22:49] free
[2:22:51] but if you turn your back upon the
[2:22:53] message and refuse to hear it notice
[2:22:55] what message the sound of the trumpet
[2:22:58] notice you're bored in the air within
[2:23:00] all that means to say that you have
[2:23:01] crossed the line between grace and
[2:23:02] judgment and you will never hear the
[2:23:04] gospel again you'll never get any
[2:23:06] further
[2:23:09] you'll stick to church
[2:23:14] you'll have just enough religion
[2:23:17] to justify your own conscience
[2:23:19] he said you must be a slave to the
[2:23:21] system you're in the rest of your days
[2:23:24] if you refuse to hear the acceptable
[2:23:26] year
[2:23:28] would you hate to be a slave to a system
[2:23:30] if it wasn't what god was calling you to
[2:23:32] if he was calling you to a higher play
[2:23:34] come up hither
[2:23:35] and you stayed down in some kind of
[2:23:37] mishmash or some kind of mixture some
[2:23:39] kind of unclear water he said now the
[2:23:41] other part of it as i said didn't need
[2:23:43] to be answered because this coming
[2:23:45] messiah a time now is when it will bring
[2:23:47] judgment
[2:23:50] pretty powerful isn't it
[2:23:53] now i want you to go to colossians if
[2:23:54] you will i know that we're a little
[2:23:56] weary here but that's all right we'll
[2:23:58] get through it colossians chapter 2.
[2:24:03] i i could read both if if i had lots of
[2:24:05] time i would read both but since i don't
[2:24:07] i'll go to the amplified
[2:24:10] he said having canceled
[2:24:13] and blotted out
[2:24:15] and wiped away
[2:24:17] the handwriting of the note the bond
[2:24:22] with its legal decrees and demands
[2:24:25] which was in force and stood against us
[2:24:30] hostile to us
[2:24:33] this note with its regulations and
[2:24:35] decrees and demands he set aside
[2:24:41] and cleared completely out of our way
[2:24:45] by doing what
[2:24:46] [Music]
[2:24:53] king james said blotting out the
[2:24:54] handwriting of the ordinances that was
[2:24:56] against us
[2:24:58] every not just accusation guilt
[2:25:02] we weren't just accused we were guilty
[2:25:06] we were guilty of transgressing the law
[2:25:08] how many of you recognize you were
[2:25:10] you were guilty i was guilty it's not
[2:25:13] just what the enemy had accused us of
[2:25:15] it's what we were guilty of ah but when
[2:25:18] jesus came to the cross guess what he
[2:25:20] did
[2:25:22] he took every legal
[2:25:25] uh
[2:25:27] case
[2:25:29] every case brought against us
[2:25:32] and nailed it to
[2:25:34] his cross
[2:25:37] verse 15
[2:25:39] god here's what i want you to hear this
[2:25:41] is why complete deliverance is possible
[2:25:43] this is why
[2:25:44] are you with me
[2:25:46] this is the reason why god
[2:25:50] disarmed
[2:25:52] is that what it says
[2:25:56] god
[2:25:58] disarmed
[2:26:00] the principalities
[2:26:02] and powers
[2:26:03] that were arranged against us
[2:26:08] and made oh
[2:26:17] can i have verse 15 in the king james
[2:26:21] and having spoiled principalities
[2:26:24] good old king james i needed him right
[2:26:25] now
[2:26:27] and having spoiled principalities and
[2:26:30] powers he made a show of them openly
[2:26:34] triumphing over them in it
[2:26:40] you hear it
[2:26:41] now give me the amplified verse 15 if
[2:26:43] you will god
[2:26:45] disarmed the principalities and powers
[2:26:48] that were arranged against us and made a
[2:26:50] bold display and public example of
[2:27:00] them triumphing over them in him
[2:27:05] and in the cross
[2:27:07] are you here
[2:27:19] a couple of things come to mind
[2:27:23] one is a naked emperor
[2:27:29] anybody remember the story
[2:27:34] he's convinced that he has such a royal
[2:27:36] robe
[2:27:39] he does not realize that he is riding
[2:27:41] around
[2:27:45] in his birthday suit
[2:27:47] did you know that there's a word here in
[2:27:50] the original
[2:27:52] that word spoiled
[2:27:55] and he having spoiled principalities and
[2:27:59] powers did you know that word spoil
[2:28:01] means to take off
[2:28:04] to strip off
[2:28:07] to disarm to take his gun away
[2:28:10] to renounce
[2:28:12] it also means to deprive someone of
[2:28:15] their power or their rights or their
[2:28:18] possession and here is the last
[2:28:20] definition of that word spoil to expose
[2:28:25] and to make naked
[2:28:30] what jesus did at the cross stripped the
[2:28:34] enemy
[2:28:37] of all of his power
[2:28:40] and then mocked him openly
[2:28:44] by parading his nakedness around the
[2:28:47] world
[2:28:48] by the preaching of the gospel
[2:28:51] every time the gospel is preached the
[2:28:54] enemy is naked
[2:28:58] he's disarmed his power has been taken
[2:29:01] away from him hallelujah
[2:29:04] he's exposed as a fraud
[2:29:08] created by god
[2:29:12] to serve the purpose
[2:29:15] of bringing perfection
[2:29:19] to the little bride of
[2:29:20] christ the enemy a tool
[2:29:26] in the hand of god
[2:29:28] to bring a bride
[2:29:30] to maturity
[2:29:32] now i'm telling you you don't have to be
[2:29:34] afraid of the hammer the if you've got
[2:29:36] any fear let your fear be directed to
[2:29:38] the one who holds the hammer
[2:29:41] the fear of the lord is the beginning of
[2:29:43] wisdom the fear of the lord the lord is
[2:29:45] the one who holds the hammer the hammer
[2:29:48] is the enemy and the hammer is being
[2:29:50] used in this hour to bring the body of
[2:29:52] christ into her perfection and
[2:29:54] completion we are not to mock but we are
[2:29:56] not to be fearful
[2:30:00] we are to understand now
[2:30:03] there's a second thing that comes to my
[2:30:04] mind also carnal the naked emperor
[2:30:07] that's kind of carnal but sure does make
[2:30:08] a picture here that every time somebody
[2:30:10] gets up and preaches the liberty of the
[2:30:12] gospel that the enemy is stripped naked
[2:30:14] over there in the corner
[2:30:16] i love that well let me give you one
[2:30:19] more
[2:30:20] to to make a a public show of
[2:30:23] it reminds me of the little children
[2:30:25] playing with one another and they got
[2:30:28] i got a uh uh i got a lollipop that you
[2:30:31] don't have
[2:30:34] i got the last watermelon
[2:30:40] dum-dum
[2:30:42] like it was fighting over last night
[2:30:45] i got the last watermelon dum-dum and
[2:30:47] then what does a kid say sometime i know
[2:30:49] it's a brat when he does it but what's a
[2:30:51] little kid say sometime
[2:30:53] what
[2:30:56] nanny nanny boo
[2:31:03] that's when you won't slap them
[2:31:05] but that's abuse
[2:31:08] yes
[2:31:10] it is
[2:31:12] because when i think of slap i don't
[2:31:14] think the hinder part you know
[2:31:16] so no you you don't want to just swat
[2:31:18] them right across they're if they need
[2:31:20] it there's a place
[2:31:22] god gave them some they what what is
[2:31:24] that brother very much posterior
[2:31:26] protoplasm
[2:31:30] if that baby's not crying enough said
[2:31:32] they'll just give him a little posterior
[2:31:34] protoplasm a little swat on the hind end
[2:31:37] i can almost hear it like this it said
[2:31:40] this is what he did he disarmed the
[2:31:42] principalities
[2:31:45] took the gun away from the devil
[2:31:48] stripped him naked
[2:31:50] so that all that he can really be as a
[2:31:52] bluff
[2:31:53] and then paraded him openly around the
[2:31:57] world every time the gospel is preached
[2:32:00] the enemy
[2:32:03] is exposed
[2:32:05] and it's almost like the holy ghost is
[2:32:07] just saying nanny
[2:32:11] [Music]
[2:32:13] i know you all were too religious to
[2:32:15] laugh
[2:32:18] i love it
[2:32:20] i love it
[2:32:21] because when the devil thinks that he
[2:32:24] can't lose
[2:32:26] he's already lost
[2:32:31] he has no power
[2:32:34] but what you allow him
[2:32:37] why because he was spoiled
[2:32:40] let me read it again and having spoiled
[2:32:42] principalities and powers he made a show
[2:32:44] of them openly triumphing
[2:32:48] over them
[2:32:49] in
[2:32:50] it
[2:32:52] parading bragging
[2:32:56] big open public
[2:33:00] showing
[2:33:01] of just how defeated the enemy really is
[2:33:06] of course we know what the scripture
[2:33:07] said
[2:33:09] if the princes of the world would have
[2:33:11] known
[2:33:12] in first corinthians chapter 2 verse 8
[2:33:15] if the princes of this world would have
[2:33:17] known
[2:33:18] they would have not crucified the lord
[2:33:20] of glory
[2:33:22] they did not know they were falling
[2:33:23] right into the plan of the living god
[2:33:26] and bringing life really causing us to
[2:33:29] have life that we could have never had
[2:33:30] without him are you still here good i
[2:33:33] only need a few more minutes
[2:33:34] revelation chapter 12.
[2:33:38] go to verse 7.
[2:33:41] and there was war in heaven
[2:33:46] michael and his angels
[2:33:49] fought
[2:33:50] against
[2:33:51] the dragon
[2:33:53] and the dragon fought against
[2:33:57] excuse me yeah and the dragon fought and
[2:34:00] his angels
[2:34:02] and prevail not
[2:34:04] neither was their place found anymore
[2:34:10] in heaven
[2:34:13] let's read on
[2:34:15] and the great dragon was cast out
[2:34:20] that old serpent called the devil and
[2:34:22] satan all one
[2:34:25] which deceiveth the whole world he was
[2:34:28] cast out into the earth
[2:34:30] and his angels were cast out with him
[2:34:33] and i heard a loud voice saying in
[2:34:36] heaven
[2:34:38] now is come salvation and strength and
[2:34:42] the kingdom of our god
[2:34:44] and the power of his christ
[2:34:47] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[2:34:52] down which accused them before our god
[2:34:57] and
[2:34:59] night
[2:35:00] do you understand how powerful that is
[2:35:03] now brother branham puts this
[2:35:06] in the tribulation
[2:35:10] because he wants to show
[2:35:13] that once satan is denied total access
[2:35:18] to the heavenlies
[2:35:20] he comes to the earth
[2:35:23] and he steps into
[2:35:27] that image of the beast
[2:35:30] and he manifests himself satan incarnate
[2:35:35] in in the antichrist so to speak
[2:35:38] now i i know
[2:35:40] that that is right i know
[2:35:44] that satan comes down
[2:35:47] and steps into a man just like he did
[2:35:50] judas iscariot
[2:35:54] now remember the bible tells us we just
[2:35:55] mentioned it that judas was born for
[2:35:57] such a purpose as that
[2:36:00] so so yes you can be elected
[2:36:04] but not elected and predestinated to
[2:36:07] eternal life you can have another call
[2:36:08] another election judas did
[2:36:11] judas had an election he had a calling
[2:36:14] he had a purpose
[2:36:16] but it was not to be a born born again
[2:36:18] son of god
[2:36:20] and he only manifested that when it was
[2:36:22] time to go up to the upper room and he
[2:36:24] could not receive the fullness of the
[2:36:26] holy ghost he could cast out devils and
[2:36:27] do all the other things that the
[2:36:29] disciples were doing under the same
[2:36:31] inspiration of the ministry of christ
[2:36:33] but when it came time for him to go all
[2:36:34] the way up to the upper room and receive
[2:36:36] the baptism of the holy ghost brother
[2:36:38] braham said he showed his true colors
[2:36:40] what he really did was stepped into his
[2:36:42] election
[2:36:43] and the bible said from that moment
[2:36:45] satan entered into him right
[2:36:48] and that's how he was able to go out and
[2:36:49] do what he did
[2:36:51] and he became a part of the forerunning
[2:36:53] antichrist spirit
[2:36:56] judas was a part of that forerunning
[2:36:58] antichrist spirit that's why the
[2:36:59] apostles could say in the new testament
[2:37:02] that the antichrist spirit was already
[2:37:03] in the earth
[2:37:05] because it had already manifested itself
[2:37:07] in the life of judas and even when the
[2:37:10] true genuine son of god was dying on a
[2:37:12] cross judas was down in the valley dying
[2:37:15] on a tree
[2:37:20] is that right
[2:37:22] and so i want you to know i fully
[2:37:24] embrace this and i'm going to read the
[2:37:25] quotes
[2:37:27] but i also believe that we are living in
[2:37:30] an hour now now i hope you won't
[2:37:32] misunderstand me
[2:37:34] but i believe that we are living in an
[2:37:36] hour now where satan does not have
[2:37:39] open access
[2:37:42] to the throne
[2:37:44] and sometimes when people read these
[2:37:46] quotations
[2:37:48] they believe that it is the same today
[2:37:50] as it was in the book of job
[2:37:55] and that the enemy could just walk in
[2:37:57] unannounced without an invitation he one
[2:38:00] time had open access
[2:38:03] he was once the worship leader
[2:38:07] he once led the worship in the
[2:38:09] heavenlies
[2:38:10] we read in hebrew when we look at the
[2:38:12] hebrew that his body was created for
[2:38:15] such things
[2:38:17] that even in his physical form were
[2:38:19] pipes and tablets that made music when
[2:38:22] he would walk before the throne when he
[2:38:24] would dance and move before the throne
[2:38:26] even his physical body would release
[2:38:28] music and sound through the praise of
[2:38:30] god
[2:38:32] it's part of the reason why pride was
[2:38:33] able to get a hold of his life
[2:38:35] that's why we see pride and music
[2:38:37] running together in many many situations
[2:38:40] we see that spirit of pride many times
[2:38:42] moving among music and we also see the
[2:38:44] perverted spirit
[2:38:47] many many many times moving around the
[2:38:49] music
[2:38:51] we see a lot of homosexuality and a lot
[2:38:53] of these kind of perverted things moving
[2:38:55] around music
[2:38:58] so what do we do we have to be on guard
[2:39:01] because the enemy is always trying to
[2:39:03] take what god blessed and pervert it
[2:39:07] and music is certainly created by god
[2:39:09] for his praise and glory
[2:39:11] so i think sometimes people hear what
[2:39:13] brother branham said about him being
[2:39:15] cast down
[2:39:17] they look at it as revelation 12
[2:39:20] and they say but they that's because
[2:39:23] they think that all of the book of
[2:39:24] revelation is written in chronological
[2:39:26] order and we know it is not
[2:39:29] because sometimes we're reading what's
[2:39:30] happening in heaven and what's happening
[2:39:32] in earth simultaneously
[2:39:34] sometimes we're reading something that
[2:39:36] has already taken place in the earth but
[2:39:38] is now being spoken about in heaven or
[2:39:40] already taken place in in heaven that's
[2:39:42] now being spoken about on the earth so
[2:39:44] we have to carefully follow the sequence
[2:39:46] of the book of revelation if we're
[2:39:48] students of the word amen
[2:39:51] and so i think sometimes when people
[2:39:53] read this they they can just picture a
[2:39:54] devil that just walks in before the
[2:39:56] throne whenever he wants
[2:39:59] but i just want you to know he can only
[2:40:01] come at the bidding of the lord
[2:40:06] now if this scripture had its total
[2:40:09] interpretation in the tribulation
[2:40:14] then some very interesting language is
[2:40:16] being used here so let me read it again
[2:40:18] he said i heard a voice saying in heaven
[2:40:22] in heaven
[2:40:24] now is come salvation and strength and
[2:40:26] the kingdom of our god and the power of
[2:40:29] his christ
[2:40:31] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[2:40:35] down which accused them before our god
[2:40:38] day and night what i believe is
[2:40:40] happening here is the authority
[2:40:43] is now what god has already accomplished
[2:40:46] in these things is now being
[2:40:48] appropriated in the earth
[2:40:51] and the enemy is no longer serving in
[2:40:54] the role
[2:40:55] of an accuser but he is now
[2:40:58] tabernacling himself in the body of a
[2:41:01] man
[2:41:02] in the in the uh really the tripartite
[2:41:05] demonstration of the antichrist spirit
[2:41:07] now it's a little a little complicated
[2:41:09] and we can talk about that another time
[2:41:12] now we know that the enemy is busier now
[2:41:15] in the earth
[2:41:18] than he is in the heavens
[2:41:20] so if he is bid before the throne he
[2:41:22] goes
[2:41:24] he has no choice
[2:41:26] but i don't want you to think that he's
[2:41:27] just waltzing in any time he gets an
[2:41:29] opportunity the cross settled that
[2:41:32] a lot of his power was stolen from him
[2:41:35] at the cross now one of these days he's
[2:41:37] coming out of the print not out of
[2:41:39] heaven
[2:41:40] he's coming out of the heavens
[2:41:45] how many of you know the earth's
[2:41:46] atmosphere is the first heaven
[2:41:48] the second heaven is where the enemy the
[2:41:50] prince of the power of the air has set
[2:41:52] up his throne in dominion and the third
[2:41:55] heaven is even in the dimensions of god
[2:41:57] the spiritual things the heavenlies that
[2:41:59] we talk about so this casting down is
[2:42:03] not satan being kicked out of heaven
[2:42:07] the throne
[2:42:08] that has already happened
[2:42:11] this is satan being cast down from the
[2:42:14] second heaven
[2:42:16] prince of the power of the air
[2:42:17] where he has taken up his dominion
[2:42:21] you know the prophet told us he is he's
[2:42:23] taken up his dominion there now he is
[2:42:26] kicked further
[2:42:27] he is pressed all the way into the earth
[2:42:30] in revelation 12 and that's when he
[2:42:32] steps in to personify the spirit of
[2:42:35] antichrist in a body of flesh
[2:42:38] and let me read this again and we'll
[2:42:40] talk about it a little more later but
[2:42:41] let me read it again and i heard a loud
[2:42:43] voice saying in heaven now it's come
[2:42:44] salvation and strength and the kingdom
[2:42:46] of our god and the power of his christ
[2:42:49] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[2:42:51] down which accused them before our god
[2:42:54] day and night this was his original
[2:42:56] commission
[2:42:57] this is what he was doing after he fell
[2:42:59] accusing the brethren before god now the
[2:43:02] bible tells us he's loosed in the earth
[2:43:04] doing what
[2:43:06] anybody remember what the enemy what the
[2:43:08] bible said he does now he he accused his
[2:43:10] brethren to brethren
[2:43:15] he's not talking to god about job
[2:43:17] anymore
[2:43:18] he's talking to you about your brother
[2:43:22] anybody follow that
[2:43:24] all right now let's read on just a
[2:43:26] minute i'm taking too much time and i
[2:43:28] realize it and they overcame him
[2:43:32] by the blood of the lamb
[2:43:34] and by the word of their testimony
[2:43:38] and they loved not their lives
[2:43:42] unto the death
[2:43:45] now in the message the first seal i want
[2:43:47] to go there and close
[2:43:49] as i wore myself out
[2:43:52] then a paragraph 362 and 363. he said
[2:43:55] then in revelation 12 79 when satan has
[2:43:59] cast out the accuser you want to put
[2:44:01] that down because i want you to read it
[2:44:03] we haven't got time now it's close 20 or
[2:44:05] 15 to 10 see but in revelation 12 7
[2:44:08] through 9 satan the spirit
[2:44:12] the devil
[2:44:13] which is set up there now accuser of our
[2:44:16] brethren all right the church is taken
[2:44:20] up
[2:44:21] and satan is cast down
[2:44:24] now what i'm presenting to you is the
[2:44:26] churches taken to the third heaven
[2:44:28] and as we're passing through the second
[2:44:30] heaven satan is cast down
[2:44:32] and what happens then he incarnates
[2:44:35] himself
[2:44:38] in the antichrist
[2:44:42] did you know that in all likelihood the
[2:44:44] antichrist is alive
[2:44:48] in all likelihood he's alive on planet
[2:44:50] earth right now and he doesn't even know
[2:44:52] who he is
[2:44:55] he doesn't even know what he's doing
[2:44:57] he's just as religious as the next guy
[2:44:59] because remember he's not coming as
[2:45:01] merely a political figure he's coming as
[2:45:03] a religious figure
[2:45:05] and remember the spirit is going to be
[2:45:07] so close that it could deceive the elect
[2:45:08] that's why we know it's not islam
[2:45:10] we know it's going to be a religious
[2:45:12] spirit that he comes right
[2:45:15] full of all kinds of
[2:45:18] religious trappings
[2:45:20] all kinds of blasphemies
[2:45:22] but he's coming with all kinds of
[2:45:24] religious trappings
[2:45:25] amen and even the scripture begins to
[2:45:27] identify the location
[2:45:31] because it's sitting on seven hills
[2:45:34] they tell me there's a place in colorado
[2:45:36] where where seven hills surround the
[2:45:38] valley
[2:45:40] i kind of doubt that's where the
[2:45:42] antichrist is coming from
[2:45:45] i think there's a more famous place
[2:45:47] that runs in the spirit of romanism
[2:45:50] anybody with me
[2:45:51] i think we're going to see that
[2:45:53] antichrist spirit rise up out of that
[2:45:55] holy catholic church i'm just telling
[2:45:57] what i believe the book of revelation
[2:45:58] says
[2:46:00] and and i think that that the antichrist
[2:46:03] as a man is most likely alive right now
[2:46:07] just waiting on his turn
[2:46:09] waiting on his turn to have a position
[2:46:12] not even realizing that in that hour in
[2:46:14] that moment in that time when satan is
[2:46:17] cast out of the second heaven
[2:46:19] i personally believe he does not have
[2:46:22] open access to the third heaven at this
[2:46:23] time he could only come at god's bidding
[2:46:26] i don't believe he can go in and accuse
[2:46:28] you any time he gets ready to i don't
[2:46:30] believe that
[2:46:32] somebody said well the bible clearly
[2:46:33] says he's the accuser of the brethren he
[2:46:35] absolutely is
[2:46:37] and he spent many many years
[2:46:39] doing such a thing
[2:46:41] but not because i mean the lord is not
[2:46:44] busy doing his kingdom business and all
[2:46:45] of a sudden
[2:46:47] satan come in and interrupt the plan no
[2:46:48] no don't see it that way at all he rules
[2:46:51] from the second heaven he rules from
[2:46:53] just above the earth's atmosphere and
[2:46:55] one of these days the church is going
[2:46:57] all the way the bride is going all the
[2:46:59] way
[2:47:00] the enemy is coming down out of that
[2:47:02] second heaven and when he does he's
[2:47:04] going straight into a man then satan
[2:47:07] incarnates himself in the antichrist and
[2:47:09] is called the beast then revelation 13
[2:47:12] he sets the mark down
[2:47:14] so if you want to know when these things
[2:47:16] will begin to unfold i have to tell you
[2:47:19] although the church is adopting another
[2:47:21] belief in this hour i have to tell you
[2:47:25] that the bride is not appointed to wrath
[2:47:29] and i have to tell you that there is a
[2:47:32] way out
[2:47:34] when he calls
[2:47:35] and that's by rapture mystery
[2:47:39] you see we're in rapture now
[2:47:42] but there's coming a combination of
[2:47:44] rapture
[2:47:45] that's going to end in a moment in a
[2:47:47] twinkling of an eye and you're going out
[2:47:49] of here
[2:47:50] the process has already started
[2:47:52] unfolding but the bride is going out of
[2:47:55] here because as long as she's here satan
[2:47:59] cannot have full authority in the earth
[2:48:02] why
[2:48:03] as long as the bride is here satan
[2:48:06] cannot have full authority in the earth
[2:48:08] why
[2:48:12] because you do
[2:48:16] because you do
[2:48:18] you mean to tell me i have full
[2:48:20] authority in the earth absolutely
[2:48:22] because of he that lives inside of you
[2:48:25] the voice of god the prophet told us the
[2:48:27] voice of god is in the bride in the last
[2:48:29] days so much so that she speaks the
[2:48:31] resurrection into place
[2:48:36] if we had a little more time uh i have
[2:48:39] some of that prepared for you where he
[2:48:41] talked about how god
[2:48:43] by the power of the creative spoken word
