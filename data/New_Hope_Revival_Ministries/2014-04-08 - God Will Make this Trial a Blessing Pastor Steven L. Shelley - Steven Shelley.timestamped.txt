[0:05] I've just come into a valley, one like
[0:09] I've never been
[0:11] before. I keep searching for a way out.
[0:15] Seems like there's padlocks on every
[0:18] door. Oh, there must be another
[0:22] sunrise, another sunset that I'll see.
[0:26] God will make this trial a blessing.
[0:30] That's the love he has for
[0:33] me. God will make this trial a
[0:38] blessing. Though it sends me to my
[0:42] knees, though my tears flow like a
[0:46] river, yet in him there sweet relief.
[0:50] There's no need to get discouraged.
[0:55] No need to talk defeat conclus.
[1:01] [Music]
[1:05] Thank you
[1:07] Jesus. I've just come into a valley one
[1:12] like I've never been
[1:14] before. I keep searching for a way out
[1:18] but it seems like there's padlocks on
[1:20] every door. Oh, there must be another
[1:25] sunrise, another sunset that I'll see.
[1:30] God will make this trial a blessing.
[1:33] That's the love he has for me. You
[1:37] believe that? God will make this trial a
[1:41] blessing.
[1:43] Lord sends me to my knees. Though my
[1:47] tears flow like the river, yet in him
[1:51] there's sweet relief. There's no need to
[1:55] get
[1:57] discourage. No need to talk defeat. God
[2:02] will make this trial a blessing and the
[2:06] whole wide world will see.
[2:11] Now I was not the first one to come into
[2:16] this place. You see every son of God.
[2:22] This same test he must face. But it is
[2:26] here that God can mold you, make you
[2:30] what you ought to be. God will make this
[2:35] trial a blessing. Just be patient. You
[2:39] will
[2:40] see God will make this trial a
[2:45] blessing. Oh, it sends me to my
[2:49] knees. Though my tears flow like a
[2:52] river, yet in him there's sweet relief.
[2:57] There's no need to get
[3:00] discouraged. No need to talk defeat. God
[3:05] will make this trial a blessing and the
[3:09] whole wide world will see.
[3:14] Now I'm standing on the mountain looking
[3:19] back where I can see. When I was in that
[3:23] deep dark valley, guess whose hand was
[3:27] holding me? Oh, it's good to see the
[3:32] sunshine. I can taste sweet
[3:35] victory. God has made my trial a
[3:39] blessing. That's the love he has for
[3:43] me. God will make this trial a
[3:48] blessing. Though it sends me to my
[3:52] knees, though my tears flow like a
[3:55] river, yet in him there's sweet relief.
[4:00] There's no need to get
[4:03] discouraged, no need to talk defeat. God
[4:08] will make this trial a blessing and the
[4:12] whole wide world will see. Now, you may
[4:16] not be able to sing this verse just
[4:19] yet because you may still feel like
[4:22] you're in the hottest part of the trial,
[4:25] but I want you to know as sure as
[4:27] there's a God, you'll be on the mountain
[4:30] again one
[4:31] day. Takes two mountains to make one
[4:33] valley, that means there's twice as many
[4:36] blessings and high places in the Lord as
[4:40] there is dark places. So if you can't
[4:42] say that I've already made it through,
[4:44] say it by faith. Proclaim it by faith.
[4:49] Now I'm standing on the mountain looking
[4:53] back where I can see when I was in that
[4:57] deep dark valley. His right arm was
[5:01] holding me. Oh, it's good to see the
[5:06] sunshine. I can taste sweet victory. God
[5:11] has made my trial a woo. That's the love
[5:15] he had for
[5:17] me. God will make this trial a blessing.
[5:22] Hallelujah. Though it sends me to my
[5:26] knees, though my tears flow like a
[5:29] river, yet in him there's sweet relief.
[5:34] There's no need to get discouraged.
[5:38] No need to talk defeat. God will make
[5:42] this trial a
[5:44] blessing and the whole wide world will
[5:48] see.
[5:49] I've heard this song for
[5:51] [Music]
[5:52] years. I've sung it lots of times, but
[5:55] there's something about a line in this
[5:58] chorus that's never struck me like it
[6:01] did this morning. I know it's true. I've
[6:04] probably said it before, but it just
[6:06] stood out at me. And here's the
[6:12] line. Though my tears flow like a river,
[6:15] that's not it. I've I've been a crybaby
[6:17] all my life. So that's not the one. It's
[6:20] the next phrase. Yet in him there's
[6:23] sweet relief.
[6:30] If you've ever had chronic pain in your
[6:32] body for about anything for any any
[6:35] reason, whatever kind of pain it
[6:37] was, hopefully it's prayer that
[6:39] delivered you, but maybe sometimes it's
[6:42] medicine that that takes the edge off.
[6:44] But there's nothing like having your
[6:47] suffering, your pain, your your
[6:50] agony leave you for just a few moments
[6:53] and find that place of relief. Maybe
[6:56] you've had respiratory trouble or
[6:58] something. All of a sudden, you get one
[6:59] deep breath as that stuff starts
[7:02] clearing out. That that wonderful peace,
[7:05] that wonderful I don't know if it's
[7:06] relief or release, but it's that
[7:09] wonderful moment when when it's all
[7:11] worth it because for just a few moments
[7:13] of time in him, you find absolute
[7:18] comfort and total peace. There's nothing
[7:21] like serving the Lord. Can you say amen?
[7:24] Amen. One more time. Listen to this
[7:28] verse. Now I'm standing on the mountain,
[7:33] looking back where I can see. When I was
[7:37] in that deep, dark valley, it was him
[7:41] holding me. Oh, it's good to feel the
[7:46] sunshine. I can taste sweet victory.
[7:50] God has made this trial a blessing.
[7:54] That's the love he has for me. Sing it
[7:58] out, would you? God will make this trial
[8:02] a
[8:03] blessing. Though it sends me to my
[8:06] knees, though my tears flow like a
[8:10] river, yet in him there's sweet relief.
[8:14] There's no need to get discouraged.
[8:18] No need to talk defeat. God will make
[8:23] this trial a blessing and the whole wide
[8:27] world will see.
[8:31] [Music]
[8:34] God will make this trial a blessing and
[8:39] the whole wide world will see.
[8:50] If you believe that, give him praise
[8:51] right now. Wonderful Lord.
