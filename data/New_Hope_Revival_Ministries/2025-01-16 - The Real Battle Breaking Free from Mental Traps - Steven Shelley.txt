TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this is a battlefield and the battle is not flesh and blood the battle is against principalities and power spiritual wickedness and high places the battle is with your accuser the battle is with a lie you'll never win a battle with a lie with another lie you'll only win a battle with a Lie by telling the truth speak the truth into that if you allow the enemy to squeeze you to that place you'll you'll you'll be the person nobody loves me and everybody hates me and everybody's out to get me you see that can lead to mental illness so the opportunity to be offended is an Ever reoccurring sort of thing amen repetitive it comes in the same door it comes through the same vessel it's dressed sometime in the same way words and phrases and expressions and what we have to do is when we recognize well we're not recognizing it very well because we didn't understand it to be a baited trap but if we can understand that like unforgiveness like Envy like jealousy like other things that we struggle within our heart when we're trying to guard it and keep it clean the enemy baits us first and then my my my when we take the bait he slams the door shut and then we become the Geral on the wheel caught oh my but if you can come if I can come to a place where we let the past strengthen us and not shade or diminish our love for one another then the purposes of God are actually being fulfilled in our life tribulation and trials situations where iron sharpeneth iron it's actually making us more like him the prophet tells us we're being honed in we're coming to a narrow point so that Jesus Christ The Living Capstone can come and take his rightful place at the head of all things is he Lord of all in your life then he's got to be Lord over your heart he's got to be king over over your emotions he's got to sit on the throne of your inner life are you a new creation in Christ then where is that old man he's to be dead and everything that's attached with him has to Die the reality is it's not automatic the reality is it has to be dealt with you're the only one that can deal with it you're the only one that can bring order to the chaos The Authority is in your mou mouth the word is in your hand it's in your mouth come on the blood of Jesus Christ is not only available to be appropriated it it it is absolutely part of the inheritance of this bride to fully appropriate the power and the blood of Jesus Christ there's been no other blood like that it's God's blood blood created by God for the specific purpose of redemption there's a life there it's Zoe life it's God's own life and if his life is there in the blood his love is there so you've not only got his life flowing through you you've got his love flowing through you and we must tear open the the roof we've got to kick down the wall we've got to burst the dams and we've got to let that love flow out it's recognizing that we're on the same team if you fail I fail if you trip I might trip if you don't succeed none of us succeed we are responsible as keepers not only first and foremost for our own mind but we are also somewhat responsible through the obligation and yet the privilege of Brotherly kindness fraternal love we are therefore responsible for the other Marines for the other team members if they fail we might fail
