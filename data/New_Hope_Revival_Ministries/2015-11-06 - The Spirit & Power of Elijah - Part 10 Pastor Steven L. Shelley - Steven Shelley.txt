TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Hello, I'm Pastor Steven Shelley and you're watching the Eagles Cry. I want to welcome you to the broadcast today. For the last few weeks, we have been studying the spirit and power of Elijah, past, present, and future. It's been an amazing study, and I hope that you have gleaned some nuggets of truth that will help prepare you to position yourselves to be one of those anointed with the spirit and power of Elijah. It is a it is a preparatory anointing, an anointing that will enable us to help prepare a people for the Lord. And I just believe that the scripture is so full of interesting nuggets that can be used and applied to our everyday life. You know, it's not just an ancient book of history. It is a living word. And that living word in us by the Holy Spirit is what quickens us to keep coming into alignment and into agreement with all that God has said about our lives. The enemy is always lying to us. Uh Satan is the father of all lies. And if we listen to him and agree with his accusations, we will never rise up into the fullness of our destiny. But if we begin to uh make our minds up, we are not going to agree with the lie of the enemy. Rather, we're going to come into agreement with what God's word has said about our lives. And when we do that, it releases something within us. It releases the anointing of God within us to continue to work in us and through us, purging us, preparing us, getting us ready to be vessels for the King of Kings and for the Lord of Lords. And I'm thankful again for the word of God and I'm thankful for you. I appreciate the Lord giving us this opportunity to minister into your life. If you have a prayer request that you'd like for us to agree with you in prayer over, we would be happy to do that, just send it to the contact information that's given to you on your screen. We'd be delighted to stand in faith with you for whatever your need is. We want to go right back into the study this week and see what God would say to us concerning this spirit and power of Elijah, how it might possibly work in us and through us as a many membered body of the Lord Jesus Christ here in the end time. Let me remind you our starting text, the theme of this study which is Malachi 4:es 5 and 6. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. Why is it important that the spirit and power of Elijah return again and again to the earth? It is important because it helps to spare the earth of a of of a smiting curse, I guess, would be a good way to put it. A smiting curse. And you know, there's so much evil and so much rebellion in the earth. I wonder how many times we would have earned a smiting curse. And yet each time God sent the spirit of Elijah and the power of Elijah to fall into the earth to somehow push that judgment out into a a future time period. And now we're coming once again very near to that hour. And so we're praying that the spirit and power of Elijah would fall in the earth. this time on a many membered bride. Not just one man operating in that anointing, but but a body, a corporate body operating in that anointing. Uh now I want us to turn today to Matthew chap 17 beginning in verse 9 going all the way to verse 13 because uh we can clearly see in the scripture that John the Baptist first it was Elijah then Elisha. Elisha had the spirit and power of Elijah on him. We know that. And then John the Baptist certainly had the spirit and power of Elijah on his life. In fact, he fulfilled a portion of Malachi 4:5 and 6. And you'll see that as we read this scripture together. Matthew 17 and9. And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, "Tell the vision to no man until the Son of Man be risen again from the dead." And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes, Elias must first come? And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come. Notice the word shall is a future word, a word that is used for future tense, not has come. Shall come first and restore all things. But I say unto you, now remember, but is a conjunction adding two similar thoughts together, but not identical phrases. But I say unto you that Elias has come already. So Jesus confirms that there will be a future, a shall be uh coming of the spirit and power of Elijah. But he also confirms that Elias truly has come. He has come already. And they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them. Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist. So here it becomes clear that Jesus was saying two things. He was saying to his disciples that those who prophesy, the scribes who say that Elias shall first come, they're right. He shall first come and restore all things. But Jesus was also saying to us, he is come already. They didn't know him. They did to him whatsoever they desired to do. That instant he was speaking about John the Baptist. I want you to notice the reason why it seems to be clear that the whole scripture is not talking about John the Baptist but two different comingings of the spirit and power of Elijah is because when we examine the ministry of John the Baptist, we do not see him as a restorer. Rather, he was a forerunner and a bridge. He was definitely a forerunner of the first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, wasn't he? We also know that the ministry of John the Baptist, although he came in the spirit and power of Elijah, he did not forun the great and terrible day of the Lord. If John the Baptist would have been the entire fulfillment of this promised coming of the spirit of Elijah, then immediately after his ministry, we would have seen the great and terrible day of the Lord. And now we are 2,000 years beyond that and and have not yet seen the fulfillment of the complete great and dreadful day of the Lord. We know that that uh John the Baptist had a great ministry. It was a scriptural ministry. What I mean by that is it was prophesied in the scripture before John the Baptist was ever born. We can find that in Isaiah 40 and verse three. It says, "The voice of him that crith in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord. Make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it." So we can certainly see here that John the Baptist came with a ministry that had been prophesied in the scripture. In fact, I want to share another verse that spoke about the ministry of John the Baptist. And that's also found in Malachi, not chapter 4 this time, but chapter 3. If you'll look at Malachi 3:1, you'll see another reference to the spirit and power of Elijah and how it would operate in in a in a messenger's ministry that would forrun the coming of the Lord. Malachi 3:1, "Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple. Even the messenger of the covenant whom you delight in, behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts." This was the forerunning ministry. Yes, he was definitely a person who would come and fulfill these scriptures. Valleys exalted, mountains and hills made low, and crooked places made straight. In other words, the ministry of John the Baptist was like building a bridge between the older covenant and the new covenant. But now when we look at that promise that there would be a restorer that the spirit and power of Elijah would come first that's what our lord said and restore all things then we have to look and see what a restorer is all about. To restore is a positive command to build. John's commission was to prepare the way by lowering mountains and raising valleys, by laying the axe to the root of the tree, reducing all human pride as grass before the Lord. But none of this is a command to restore. Therefore, again, this could not be a reference to John the Baptist and his ministry alone. There had to be a another installment, another fulfillment because the ministry of John the Baptist was not a restoring ministry. Now look at John chapter 1 because I want you to look at every one of these scriptures to get the full picture. John chapter 1 beginning in verse 19 and going through verse 23. And this is the record of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who art thou?" And he confessed and denied not, but confessed, "I am not the Christ." And they asked him, "What then? Art thou Elias?" And he saith, "I am not. Art thou that prophet?" And he answered, "No." Then said they unto him, "Who art thou, that we may give an answer to them that sent us?" What sayest thou of thyself? And look what he said. He went back to Isaiah 40 and he said, "I am the way. I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, make straight the way of the Lord, as saith the prophet Isaiah." So he was letting them know, I am not fulfilling the entirety of Malachi 45 and 6, but I am fulfilling the scripture in Isaiah 40 and3, the voice of him that crith in the wilderness. What this lets me know is that John was well aware that he was indeed coming in the spirit and power of Elijah, but that he would only fulfill a portion of Malachi's prophecy. Now, this scripture that I'm about to share with you now will help make that even clearer for you, I'm sure. And it is found in Luke 1, verse 13. But the angel said unto him, "Fear not, Zachcharias, for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John." Remember that Elizabeth was barren. And thou shalt have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice at his birth, for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink. And he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb. Wow, what a prophecy. What a word of the Lord concerning this unborn child. he would receive the Holy Ghost even in his mother's womb. And many verse 16 of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. Get that turn because that's again a reference to the work of the spirit and power of Elijah to turn hearts. And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias. Elijah, who is him? Him is the Messiah. Him is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised savior. He shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. Did you notice that? It almost appears as though the angel of the Lord misqued the prophecy of Malachi. Now, how would that be possible that the angel of the Lord would come and misquote Malachi's prophecy? Because when he is speaking specific specifically about the ministry of John the Baptist, when he speaks specifically about the ministry of John the Baptist, he says this to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children. What about turning the hearts of the children to the fathers? It's not mentioned. Rather, he says and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just. Now, some people look at that and they say, "Well, it's the same thing." Well, I don't believe that the angel of the Lord's presence would come like that and misquote the scripture. I think it is very intentional. I think it is a message to us that the coming of John the Baptist in the spirit and power of Elijah would fulfill the first portion of Malachi 45 and 6. the first part of that prophecy, turning the hearts of the fathers to the children. Now, how did John the Baptist do that? Well, in essence, he turned the hearts of the fathers to the children. And by doing that, it was bridging the gap between the fathers of the faith, the patriarchs of the faith to those who would come and receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. In other words, John the Baptist had an amazingly difficult task because his job was to let the fathers know that what God is doing now in the children is also for you. It is the fulfillment of what you have longed for. This one who is about to come is going to fulfill everything you have waited for your whole life. This is the Messiah. If you'll remember, that's how he did it. Behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world. You'll remember that when Jesus came to John the Baptist to be baptized. And this was an hard task. I mean, it was a hard thing for John to accept when he realized exactly who the Lord was. This wasn't just his cousin. This was the promised Messiah for all of Israel. And as he was walking down the bank of the river to be baptized, John gets a revelation that drops from heaven right down into his spirit. And he doesn't greet Jesus Yeshua by saying, "Hello, cousin. It's good to see you." But rather, he gives this prophetic declaration to all. Behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world. It was the job of the spirit and power of Elijah to identify the one who would come and redeem the sins of all Israel. This was the commission placed on the life of John the Baptist and he certainly did that well. But there needed to be the other portion of Malachi 4:es 5 and 6. It needed to be fulfilled as well. And we'll look at that sometime in the in the next broadcast probably. Now I want to go back and read verse 17 again and then talk about two of the words that are used there. He shall go before him. This is the prophecy of the angel of the Lord to Zachcharias concerning his son to be born John the Baptist. He shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. What a beautiful verse of scripture. to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. That's why we believe that there needs to be an outpouring again of the spirit and power of Elijah even in our day that will help make ready a people prepared for the Lord. Why does the scripture say in the spirit and power of Elijah? Well, that word spirit in the Greek is numa and it means wind. It means breath. It even means mind or mental disposition. So the the angel was saying to Zachcharias, your son is going to come in the same mental disposition as Elijah. Now, that's why we studied for weeks the characteristics of the prophet Elijah, a man of the wilderness, a man who was not afraid to confront false religion and the religious norm of the day, a man who came demonstrating the raw power of God, a man of extreme emotional highs and emotional lows, and a man who was chosen to confront the Jezebel spirit. Because the angel said, "When your son comes into his ministry, he's going to come in the same mental disposition as Elijah the prophet." And so if we examine the life of John the Baptist, we see a lot of the same characteristics that we saw in the life of Elijah. Perhaps you remember when John the Baptist was faced with a situation where he could have easily compromised. He is called on the scene before the ruling elder, the ruling leader of the day and given an opportunity that he he could have been political. But instead, if you will remember, he answered by Herod by saying, "It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother Philip's wife. You're breaking the commandment of God." Wow. This was a difficult thing to do. That sounds like Elijah confronting the prophets of Bahel. He knew this could cost him his life. And in fact, we know from the scriptural record it did cost him his life. His head was was cut off and and even presented on a charger simply because he would not compromise with the sin of adultery. He called out the leader of the land. He called out Herod and he said, "You're breaking the laws of God." In other words, it doesn't matter who you are and how much authority you have, you have an obligation to obey the word of the Lord. I like that. I believe that John the Baptist operated in the same mental disposition, in the same mind of Elijah the prophet and also in the same wind, in the same breath, in the same spirit, in the same vein of anointing. There's no doubt about it. So then we have the word power. He's going to operate in the spirit and power of Elijah. And that word power that's used there in the book of Luke is dunamis. Maybe that's a word that some of you Bible students are familiar with. Dunamis. It means strength, authority, military force, miraculous power, ability, abundance. So the the angel was saying to Zachcharias concerning the ministry of his son John the Baptist, he will operate in the same strength, in the same military force, in the same authority, in the same miraculous power, in the same ability, in the same abundance as Elijah the prophet. And so I think this is a tremendous confirmation that that spirit and power of Elijah was of such a tremendous value that God said it needs to not only just fall on Elisha, the one who would immediately follow the Elijah ministry. But at another very important time in history, it needed to come into the earth again. Please understand this is not reincarnation. This is not a man who has died, being reincarnated, coming back to visit the earth in a physical form. This is God taking of the spirit and the anointing and the characteristics of Elijah and saying, "These are of of of such value, I'm going to send them right back upon another man into the earth to fulfill a similar task." And what was the ultimate need for this spirit and power of Elijah? It was to prevent the earth from being smitten with a curse. How many of you remember that from the scripture? Now, how important was recognizing that John the Baptist was the fulfillment of scripture? How important was it in their day that that men and women be able to discern and to understand that John was not just an ordinary preacher, but he had come with a biblical ministry. He had come with a divine commission to introduce the the coming, the first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. Not a restorer in the sense that things that were broken down and thing truth that had been lost was restored but in the sense of a bridgebuilder in in the sense that he did exactly uh the first part of Malachi's prophecy. He shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children. And that's exactly what he did. And I want you to know that was a task. As I said a moment ago, it was very difficult for some of those uh uh patriarchs, those men who had walked in the laws and instruction of Moses. And now here comes a new ministry on the scene. It was very difficult for them. And had it not been for the work of John the Baptist, perhaps there wouldn't have been so many who were persuaded. I'm thankful for what God did then and what he's doing now. Let me pray for you. Father, thank you that you sent your word to heal us. Thank you for teaching us your ways. Thank you for helping to prepare our hearts for what you're going to do in us and through us in the end time. I ask you to pour out of your spirit upon every person who's seeking you right now. In the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Yeshua, our Messiah, we pray. Amen. And amen. I can't tell you how much I appreciate you spending this time with me. And I can I humbly ask you to do it again. Will you stay tuned for the next Eagle's Cry? We'll be back and we're going to continue to study the spirit and power of Elijah. God bless you. Bye-bye for now. [Music] [Applause] [Music]
