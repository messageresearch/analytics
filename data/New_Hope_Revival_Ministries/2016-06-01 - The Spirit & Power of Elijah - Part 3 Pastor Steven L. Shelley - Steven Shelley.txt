TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] oh [Music] [Music] praise the Lord I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and you're watching the Eagles cry it's a real joy to welcome you to the broadcast today and to let you know that I count it a privilege to be able to speak to you in the holy and exalted name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah it's a joy and I mean that I thank him for the strength and the health to be able to come to you today and share with you some of the good news I hope I can encourage you along the way to keep pressing on toward Christ toward the lord Jesus whatever you're dealing with in your life right now it may be tough it may look Bleak but I want you to know that there is hope and life in the Lord Jesus if you'll trust him with everything that that is within you he is faithful to bring us through if we can help you in your in your need of prayer you have a need physically or spiritually you need provision the one thing that we can do is stand with you in faith and in prayer so feel free to contact our ministry and we will certainly take your needs with a petition before the Lord and you know what I just believe if we pray together he'll hear the prayer that's what the scripture said where two or more agree as touching on any one thing in my name he said well I'm going to give it to them and you know what in my life he has a proven track record I've been following the Lord for a long time he came to me as a small child and and invited me to follow him to be his disciple and uh I've been following him I have made many mistakes along the way and uh I thank him for Grace I thank him for Mercy I love the fact that he's patient with folk like me to teach me and sometimes retach me have you ever learned a lesson that you didn't learn all the way and he had to come and bring that back around and teach you all over again well that's how it works with our own children uh certain lessons they learn right away certain children learn faster than others some children if they touch the the hot stove one time they never touch it again they suffer that little bit of pain and that is the end of that and then there are other children who seem to possess a strong will and they'll touch it several times to see if they get the same results and they will if you touch a hot stove I don't care how many times if it's still hot it's going to hurt and you know God is patient he's patient with each of us uh if we're one of those who touches it one once and then moves on to the next lesson or if we're one of those that just has to keep testing and trying it to see if it'll hurt every time you know I'm afraid I've been I've been the ladder a time or two and and I've had to touch it again and go back around that mountain again to learn what what God wanted me to learn but I'm better off for it and you will be too uh try not to get discouraged in the school of life and let God teach you and train you with the patience that he has I tell you he has more patience even than than a mother he really does to just keep working in our lives and bringing us through for his glory for his mighty purposes uh we are studying together the spirit and power of Elijah past present and future and we're looking at Malachi 45 and six for our theme where the scripture promises behold I will send you a Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord this indicates to us that the spirit and power of Elijah was of such significance in the mind of God that it was to be sent and resent to the Earth and so to help us understand uh the characteristics of the Elijah from scripture that Prophet that we're familiar with uh we that this is how we uh helped to discern other visitations other applications of the spirit and power of Elijah by looking at the life of the original one and so uh I was looking at a scripture here just a moment ago in First Kings chapter 17 uh beginning in verse one where it talks about really this is some training going on for Elijah and it says and Elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabit of Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be due nor rain these years but according to my word up to this point we don't know very much about Elijah the Bible doesn't talk much about his formative years his his uh you know childhood his teenage years his schooling or training or uh we don't know very much about him at all and all of a sudden he appears on the scene Elijah the tishbite and he is prophesying to the king and so there are things that we don't know about him but I can assure you that he was in school from the time he was born Spirit school where God was teaching him and training him to get him ready to be able to deliver what a bold and courageous move it was for Elijah to go right up and give the word of the Lord to the king and the word of the Lord came unto him saying verse two now verse three get thee hint and turn Eastward and hide thyself by the Brook cherith that is before Jordan this was the first characteristic that we were talking about on the Last Broadcast and that is Elijah was a man of the Wilderness he understood because God instructed him so to pull himself away he Ood the value of being separated in fact the very Brook of water that God sent Elijah to was called cherith and that is before Jordan it's it's it leads into the Jordan River and that word chth means separated so this was a further level of Separation in the life of Elijah uh what I want you to know is that when God pulls you away when he slows you down gives you the unction to pull aside and because he wants to speak to you he's not going to leave you there by yourself he's going to show up he's going to make provision he's going to minister to you and that's what we find out here in First Kings 17 verse 4 and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the Brook and I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there so this chapter begins with a prophecy that says there shall be neither due nor rain these years but according to my word what a bold statement Elijah said it's not going to rain again and no Dew is going to form on the ground in the morning unless I prophesy it unless I decree it unless I declare it this sounds like a drought on the horizon and sure enough we read the scripture and find out that's exactly what was happening and it wasn't going to change until Elijah the prophet called for the change called for the shift but God said Elijah I'm going to pull you aside down here to the brook cherith separate you from what's going on in the earth just like he did uh in Goan when the children of Israel were protected of the plagues that were being sent to Egypt to deal with the stiffness of Pharaoh's heart and yet God had his people down there in that little area called Goan where they were protected from from the from the fierceness of the plague the worst of the fierceness of those plagues they were protected so here's Elijah in his little Goan uh by the Brook and God said though there be no water falling and no water rising from the ground there will still be water in that Brook how many of you know if it's not raining eventually there's not going to be any water and and rather quickly in in the land of the Bible where it only rains a few short weeks weeks out of the entire year I've been in Israel enough to know that when there's no rain it is Dusty dry and when it begins to rain the ground is so hard that it cannot even receive the rain and the rain just washes off the top of the hard dirt and I've been to places where it comes so quickly through those Wades that it just washes the road away cars and everything and and it happens so quickly that people don't even realize it's going to happen and so if there was a if there was a drought on top of the dry season we're talking about a terrible situation and yet God said you go right down there to that Brook and I'll give you water to drink this helps me it encourages me to know that I if God is leading he's providing he's taking care of my needs if I can only learn to trust him and listen at this you're not only going to have water water to drink but I have commanded the birds the Ravens to feed thee there I mean that's good news now how God was going to do that I don't know if it was going to be supernaturally created bread or if God was going to send the Raven down to the neighbor's house uh uh where the bread was cooling on the wind seal and God said my Prophet needs some of that and the Raven just goes down picks it up with his beat carries it to Elijah I don't know how the food was provided but it it wasn't Elijah's he didn't cook it he didn't have the supplies to make it and yet God fed the Prophet Elijah by the birds of the air so he went and did according to the word of the Lord for he went and dwelt by the Brook cherith that is before Jordan and the Ravens brought him bread and flesh now don't don't forget that wasn't just bread but at least a sandwich because it there was bread and meat in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook two full meals a day and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land now God could have continued to supernaturally supply The Source but it was time for a change of location and so that's what happened the brook ran dry let me encourage you that if you're in a situation where the supply is cut off and the brook runs dry that's not a time to be upset with God that's not a time to say he's forgotten me he was providing for me so well and then all of a sudden he stopped perhaps he's trying to speak to your heart perhaps he's trying to reassign you lead you on to new and fresh territory it might be geographical it might be just spiritual he may be just getting ready to take you to another level in the of the spirit and in the in the arena of ministry and so we have to be sensitive to his voice you know we get comfortable amen we get comfortable and and we we like it things are going good and and people really love me here and uh all is well and I have what I need and the next thing you know the spirit comes by and says I need you over there and you say wait a minute I I'm very happy here I don't want to go anywhere where else and so what does God end up having to do sometime he has to end up letting the Brook Run dry so that we get the picture and uh I think I've talked about that that one that that child that we have sometime that keeps touching the stove because he has to learn the lesson I have to be honest and tell you that I have missed this this subtle message of the Lord rather really it's not so subtle it's pretty obvious when the Supply runs out something's got to be adjusted Ted and it may not always mean God sending you somewhere else it it may not mean that always but it means that you need to stop and re-evaluate what's going on and and make sure that you're still uh functioning in the fullness of what God would have for you in this particular season now I might mention that when the brook ran dry God didn't forget about his needs he was just moving him on to another place and we won't do it maybe right this moment but we could we could talk about the next level of of provision well why don't I just read it uh verse eight and the word of the Lord came unto him again saying or unto him saying arise get thee to zarapa which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee see he commanded that the brook continue to to supply his water and that the Raven bring him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening when the brook ran dry the Ravens quit coming God had it all in his hand and so he said get up it's time for you to change locations but don't worry I have already commanded did you see this I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee I've already prepared her I've already chosen her and uh there's a great scripture in the New Testament that talks about that there were many many widows in Israel at that time but it was one that was chosen Chen elected selected by God to be used in the sustaining of the Elijah Ministry of the ministry that Elijah had in that hour everyone wasn't wasn't selected to do that but this particular widow woman was commanded and Elijah arose uh verse 10 and went to zarap and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there Gathering sticks and he called to her and said fetch me I pray a little water in a vessel that I may drink that's that's a little bit Bold And as as she was going to fetch it he called to her now remember there was this law of hospitality and so that was uh you know relatively not a shocking thing uh I need some water I'm traveling but after that he calls to her and and says fetch me I pray thee first a little water and then he said bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thy hand now he said asking for a snack and uh so she responds and says as the Lord thy God liveth I don't have a cake of bread but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise and behold I'm out Gathering two sticks and that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die now I don't know if you hear the hopelessness in that but I do we've got just enough oil and just enough meal to make one little cake we're going to divide it we're going to eat it we're going to lay down and die because there's nothing else no more meal in the barrel no more oil in the cruise and then Elijah challenges her her faith in an unbelievably powerful way I love this he said unto her fear not do you know fear paralyzes us from stepping out in faith and and how many times in the Bible does the captain of the host show up the an angel uh a messenger of God uh Gabriel you know great great uh instances in the scripture where something super Supernatural takes place and a a mighty visitation entails and the and the greeting the salutation is fear not why is it that way because that messenger knows that fear is in the house fear is present and and fear paralyzes Faith there's a remedy for fear the Bible said perfect love casteth out fear and if the enemy can can SE fear in our lives he really can paralyze us from doing the will of the father and so the prophet under the unction and inspiration of the Holy Spirit deals with the fear first and and explains to her that she should not be afraid to go and do as thou has said just continue on with your program but make me a little cake first she's already told him she doesn't have a cake she's just got a little bit left she's going to have to make a a mini cake and now he says make me one first if there's not enough to make one cake only a mini cake how is he asking for a cake but he does make me a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son for thus saith the Lord God of Israel this is powerful word uh the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruise of oil fail until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth now that was a promise on multiple levels a promise that I don't care how many cakes you make I don't care how many times you visit that meal Barrel there's always going to be enough meal there to make the necessary cake I don't care how much oil you use in making those cakes every time you go back to that cruise of oil it will not fail now I want you to notice that there was no promise here that it would be filled up I don't see anywhere where it says the next time you go to the meal Barrel it's going to be full and running over and the next time you you go to get oil from the cruise it's going to be you know gushing out the top but what the promise is is that the meal shall never waste and the oil shall never fail and what that what I believe that means I may be adding a little bit here to by my own understanding but here's what I think that means because I've watched God move this way basically every time she went to that Barrel she had to use Faith she had to reach in and get the last bit of meal and God would always keep putting meal in that Barrel every time she went to use the oil but when she would look back there it would not have been diminished there was still just enough meal just enough oil not a full vessel but she'd pour it out and yet look back and there would be just enough so each time she made a cake she had to exercise her faith in that promise oh my that's a key that's a key for you and I each time if you know sometimes we say if I just had a a million dollars what could I do for God if I just had a way of all my bills being paid I wouldn't worry I wouldn't be in such a fix so forth and Etc we just have all these ideas in America people say things like if I could win the lottery you know if I could hit the jackpot uh I want you to know if you had uh all that abundance falling down on you you might not have to use your faith you might even forget about the God who supplied it the next thing you know you might start thinking you did something good to earn all of that in the storehouse and so uh in order for for God to keep us sometime in a place where we continue to put our full trust and all of our hope in him and in his promise we find that there's not a a full barrel of meal and a full Cruise of oil but have have you ever found out I have that God often as you pour it out you look back and there it is again filled up spiritually speaking here filled up you know you you you write the last check and you wonder how you're going to write the next one but somehow God supplies somehow the need is there sometimes you surprise yourself you get surprised at how God supplies uh and I don't mean you know always enough to waste and and and to spree but but my God shall supply all of my needs according to his riches in glory I believe that promise I truly believe it and so every time and and listen at this that is going to continue God said that is going to continue until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the Earth that's the prophecy of Elijah so she not only got a present promise one for right now every time you need the a meal it'll be there every time you need oil it'll be there until the day until the day that the rain begins so what God was giving her was a promise for the present and a promise for the future as long as you need this Supply it will be there but as soon as the rain begins to fall again God will use another means to supply your need how did Elijah learn that lesson CU it had just happened it was happening to him God sent him down there the birds fed him the brook gave him water now God said go I've got a widow prepared and so really he wasn't afraid to put that on her because he knew that God had already set her aside that's what it means God has prepared a widow it seems like that she was still moving in some hopelessness because she said we're going to lay down and die but she had been prepared preped by God to sustain in that hour I I love this promise it it really encourages uh encourages me to keep believing and keep pressing forward and she went verse 15 and did according to the saying of Elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days now we know why God gave this promise through Elijah he was going to stick around he wasn't just going to eat that one cake he was going to get to enjoy cakes from her oven day after day after day as God continued to supply and sustain and verse 16 gives us the Fulfillment and the barrel of meal wasted not Hallelujah neither did the cruise of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah and then it goes on and we continue to read of the exploits of Elijah the prophet so I want you to know that before God could launch Elijah into the fullness of his Destiny he had to pull him aside and deal with him challenge him stretch him a little bit work on him I want to just briefly mention the second characteristic as we leave you today Elijah preached without fear against the religious order and the spiritual Norm of his day to call people back to the faith now this is a powerful attribute and characteristic in the life of this Elijah the prophet he preached without fear against the religious order and the spiritual Norm of his day to call people back to the faith how long halt ye and one of the ways he did that we'll talk about it next time we're together he started out in this challenge how long halt ye between two opinions if God be God serve God I want to say that to you I want to leave that thought in your mind how long will you stand on the fence between two religions between two Fai faiths if Jesus be God then turn loose of your other gods and serve the Lord Jesus Christ with all your heart yes you'll be misunderstood yes many of you will be rejected in your culture yes many of you will have you'll create problems in your family but I want you to know that you can't hold on to God the Living God Jehovah God the god of the Bible the god of Jesus Christ you can't hold on to that God and hold on to the god of another religion and another Faith there are not many ways to God there's one way to God Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by Me Jesus is the door he is the gate if you're ever going to get to God you'll have to go by Jesus Christ Lord I ask you right right now to minister to every need that is represented in this television congregation right now around the world I ask you to continue to teach and lead and equip us to follow you with all of our hearts release your healing virtue I pray right now in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ For Your Glory and your glory alone thank you so much for being with me I I feel you I know that as I'm sitting here today I can't see you but I feel you pulling I know this is going to get to you at just the right time when you need it the most so would you please tune in again next time to the Eagles cry God
