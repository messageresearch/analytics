TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right Christ in you the hope a lord hello there I'm Pastor Steven Shelley of New Hope revival ministries and I'm coming to you today on behalf of the gospel channel our wonderful partners in getting the good news of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ around the world I want to thank you again for tuning into the broadcasts today I believe the Lord is going to speak to us from his word he's been so faithful to do that as we have been meeting together in this way today we're going to begin another installment of a series that we have been working on this would be number 7 in the series schemes and devices and before we get into the study today I want to show you something I brought this out here just to show you our concern for your prayer requests for your needs this is a folder and these are the prayer requests that have come in I want you to see this stack these are the prayer requests that have come in from you our viewers in the last three weeks and I'm I'm you know I to say I'm excited sounds a little strange because there are so many desperate needs in in these notes in these emails in these phone calls but what I'm excited about is the opportunity that God is giving us to stand with you in prayer and in agreement and I want to say that testimonies have started coming in and that's what we're looking for that's what we're believing for that as we agree with you concerning your needs that God begins to move in such a way that it cannot be denied and you receive a testimony and my prayer in my desire is that you would then take the time to share that testimony with us even if it's just a slight move in the right direction even if you can see improvement I would be so delighted to hear what God is doing for you and I keep this folder with me just recently I went to a missionary camp in North Carolina and I took this folder with me so that when my prayer time would come I would be able to hold it put my hands on it skim through some of the pages and read the needs again and ask the Lord specifically to move on your behalf and so I want to invite you to keep sending in your prayer requests and your testimonies either by email or by phone call just remember that there is a great time difference between where we live in Alabama and where most of you would be viewing this program and so it is possible that you would get a recording but that is a prayer line for you to leave your prayer requests and then we have a sister who will come and and transcribe your call and put it in our caller tracking and then I've been printing them out so that I can have them with me as I said just a moment ago and so let us hear from you maybe it's easier for some of you just to send an email and all of that contact information is given to you on the program but anyway I want to thank the Lord today for answered prayer and I want to thank him for this opportunity that brother Eric Erickson has given us that we could partner with the gospel channel and continue to get the truth of God's precious word into your home we've been on this study schemes and devices and the theme scripture for our studies together has been second Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 and it reads lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices and I want to just say that I believe ignorance is leaving our lives when it comes to the schemes and devices of the enemy I believe that many so many of you have reached out to us because you are able to recognize that what you're going through is a scheme it is a device of the enemy it is an attack against your life against your family against your church your ministry against your physical body and when we recognize that this is not just perhaps a getting older thing or this is the way it has to be in life thing but when we recognize that what we're going through is indeed an assault of the enemy against us then we we approach that in a completely different way and it is the will of God according to the Apostle Paul that we should learn his devices nobody wants to talk about the devil but we must learn some of the ways or as many of the ways as we possibly can that he unleashes his fury his anger against the children of God because I truly believe that God is raising up an overcoming company of believers the bride of Jesus Christ the fully adopted sons of God in these last days who will move in a new level of intercession a new level of authority against the works of the enemy I truly believe that where we have struggled and where we have battled and where we have seemingly wrestled with the enemy I believe that God desires to move his people into a new level so that we struggle less and we speak with greater authority and remember that when God releases greater authority to the Bride of Christ it's because he has seen in us he has recognized in us a new of surrender a new level of dedication and consecration newer realms of authority they don't fall upon us automatically but it is a response it is a blessing from the Lord when he sees us digging into the Word of God drawing near to him and focusing on the truth of God's Word instead of the lies of our circumstances when God sees us moving in that direction it is his good pleasure it is his joy to release to us the authority that he has purchased for us with his own blood and I am just thankful for what I see God doing so with this new level of authority that that the bride is beginning to walk in we must understand a lot of things you know God wants to open the eyes of our understanding to a lot of deeper truths from his word and remember that this is the season this is the hour we are living in the end times in fact I always say we're living in the last of the last days and so there is a company of people that have been prophesied that have been promised the overcomers and what does it mean to be an overcomer it means to come over and the first thing that we're overcoming is unbelief we're overcoming sin which has its root in unbelief and we're beginning to use the weapons that we've had all along in our disposal the Word of God and I'm going to talk to you today about another application of how we can use the word of God to defeat the enemy in our lives and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah his precious blood that He shed for at Calvary all of these things become great weapons and great instruments to use in prayer in prophetic declaration and decree when we speak the truth of God's Word from our heart of course through our mouth it originates in our heart the seed of all human emotion and it projects with our voice it comes out of our mouth and we decree it and we declare it did you know that there are angels of God that are assigned to protect to guard the Word of God did you know that's how precious God's Word is to him that he has assigned a company of angels to guard as guardians of the word and did you know that when you surrender your life to Him and you follow him beyond the born-again experience and into the overcoming lifestyle and you speak that word did you know that those angels I believe are dispatched to guard that word of God that comes out of your mouth I believe they not only guard that word and watch over that word and protect that word but I believe they minister in in many ways to accelerate the fulfillment of that word to help bring that word to pass I was actually in the United Kingdom where many of you are watching today and I was in the beautiful city town of Torquay I hope I'm saying that right down in the southern part I believe of of the United Kingdom just a few years back and I was staying in a beautiful hotel I was speaking in a conference in the hotel and I had an experience with some angels I I don't know how deep I'll go into the today but I you know we don't always see angels some people have never seen an angel and that's not something to be discouraged or defeated about but please just because you've never had the opportunity to see them don't for one minute begin to think that they're not real and try not to doubt if someone that you have confidence II and then you know their life if they tell you that their eyes have been open to see try to be a believer you know sometimes it's harder to believe than it is to doubt it's easy to doubt but I'd like to live a life that it's it's harder for me to doubt the supernatural you know it's easier to believe it than to doubt it that's the life I want to live but anyway I saw these angels and I saw recognize the number how many there were and I wondered about their assignment and they and they communicated to me that they were guardians of the Word of God they were stewards of the Word of God specifically the words that had been spoken over that area of torquey am I saying that right Torquay across the bay and I believe if I remember correctly beyond was the English Channel they were guarding protecting the Word of God now that encourages me that encourages me for Smith Station Alabama because there have been wonderful promises made over this community over this area not just our ministry base here on what we call the Eagles refuge campground but the community at large and there was a word one time that spoke about God extending the the area of our spiritual jurisdiction and and and how many miles it would go out in a circular pattern and I claim that and I believe that no matter where you're watching me there have been promises made over that area maybe over the ministry that you're connected with maybe over your family your own life and you've not yet seen the entire fulfillment or fruition of those promises and of course I know the devil I know how he works trying to do everything he can to discourage us from holding on to the promise of God but somehow you've been holding on I just want you to be aware that you are not in this holding on battle alone I want you to know that there are heavenly hosts that are assigned by God to watch over his word concerning your life your family your home and your ministry and I just believe that knowing that I know it gives me a great sense of encouragement and new courage and I pray that it would I had no intention of sharing that with you today but I feel like the Lord knew all along that that was going to be something that would speak to somebody so you just take that right now if you never see them if you're never physically aware that those angels are laboring around you guarding guarding and stewarding the precious words of truth if you never see them if you never feel them if you never even sense their presence just know that the Bible tells us that he assigns angels he gives them charge authority over our lives to protect us and to keep us and if God is concerned about me stubbing my toe lest I would - my foot against a stone if God is concerned about me stubbing my toe so much so that he gives angels to help protect me and keep me then surely he's jealous over his word and so just be aware of that as we move forward in our study today that you're not in this battle alone praise God but you have the help and strength and courage and boldness of the Lord you and you have the cooperation of the heavenly hosts the angelic beings created as worshippers of the Living God and as stewards of the promises of God I want to share with you a very familiar portion of Scripture from Paul's writings to the church at Ephesus the book of Ephesians we learned it in Sunday school we've sung about it we've heard sermons about it but I want to share it with you today Ephesians chapter 6 verses 10 through 18 and I'm going to read it first in the King James very quickly because I know that a lot of us are very familiar with the way it's presented in the King James and then I want to share it with you in the amplified version of the Bible because it greatly amplifies this portion of Scripture finally my brethren verse 10 be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might hallelujah put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil the schemes and devices of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities now listen because we're getting a little insight into the order of that realm of darkness I believe that there is great order among the heavenly hosts I don't understand at all I couldn't give it to you line by line ABC because I don't fully understand it either but I know there are Archangels and I know there are other kinds of angels who have other functions in the kingdom of and also as we read here in in Ephesians 6:12 there is some sort of order rank hierarchy in the kingdom of darkness and so this makes me want to pay close attention because the enemy wants you to think you're fighting with flesh and blood he did she did he said she said preacher you don't know what they did to me well all of that may be true but our battle as Holy Ghost Ville believers in the Lord Jesus Christ it's not with one another our battle is not with people it's not with personalities it's with principalities we have to understand that behind the human conflict there is another force at work we're not wrestling against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places but here is the precious remedy here is the solution to all of these dark entities principalities rulers of the darkness of this world spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day that's where we are in the evil day and having done all give up quit go home and take your toys is that what it said no that's not what it said at all there's no giving up in the army of God there's no retirement in the kingdom of God it's not time to retire it's time to refire we can't get upset and go home take our little marbles with us in our pocket and say I I give up oh no sir because you may but I can guarantee you the devil is not going to give up he's going to continue his onslaught and if you're not there to resist him and oppose him he's going to gain the victory over your life no sir we can't allow that to happen we've got to stand having done all not quit having done all stand and then verse 14 stand there for how you're gonna stand he's telling us having your loins Girt about with truth you've got on a girdle of truth a belt of truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace verse 16 and above all that's that's interesting it gives us some some insight into importance we've had several pieces of armor revealed to us but listen and how this verse opens above all taking the shield of faith so above the belt of truth above the breastplate of righteousness above having your feet shod with the preparation of peace take the shield of faith how important is the shield of faith evidently very important because it's above all wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked now I tell you that's powerful to take the sting out of them to take the fire out of them they may come but without fire without sting if you meet them with the shield of faith and take verse 17 the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God now I know that the Word of God is the most important thing in all of this but remember that the writer says above all the shield of faith why because your faith in the Word of God as we taught you right here your faith in the Word of God helps to activate that word in your life you've got to attach your faith to the word or it might be effective in everyone else's life around you and not in your life well that's not the fault of the Word of God that's because as the book of Hebrews tells us that's because it the word didn't profit them because it was not mixed with faith so you've got to get that shield of faith out there you've got to hold it up high that that's the purpose of a shield you've got to hold it up to protect your head you've got to protect your eyes your face your brain you've got to you know you raise it up and you don't just hold it there you move that thing around to meet the challenge of the fiery dart take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God verse 18 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints well so much for reading it quickly I broke it down a little bit didn't I and I want to pull out granny's classic amplified bible here this has been around for a long long time this was my grandmother's amplified bible and i want to read those same verses to you in this version because it lives it's amplified no doubt about it and so in verse 10 again Ephesians 6 in conclusion be strong in the Lord be powered through your union with him isn't that precious it's precious to me be strong in the Lord how how can we be strong in him we are empowered we are endued with power from on high through our union our oneness our relationship with him you can't live a detached life way out there somewhere on the edge and expect to move in the strength and the power of the Lord you've got to come a little closer you've got to draw near remember the Bible says Jesus tells us if you draw nigh to me I will draw nigh to you this is the promise of the scripture we come near to the Lord and he draws nearer to us we have to come a little closer if you're cold if you're if you're if you're suffering and needy you come a little closer to the fire and there you can feel with with more intensity the heat that the fire provides coming closer to the Lord with our thoughts even even with our thoughts you know our concept of drawing closer to the Lord is often I got to pray more got a fast more got to go to church more got to sing more got it and and yes it's true the the closer we get to his heart the more we love the things that he loves and we gain strength from the corporate gathering of the Saints and we gain strength from fasting in prayer all of these things are true but that's not exactly what drawing closer to the Lord is all about it's moving your heart and and how do we do that we can only do that with our thoughts with our mind it's being more mindful keeping the Lord on our mind the Bible said I will keep him in or them in great peace those who love the law of the Lord and nothing shall by any means offend them great peace have they which love the law of God and nothing shall by any means if in them if you want to stay out of the arena of offense in your life you've got to keep your peace and God's peace in your own thoughts when we draw closer to the Lord and we take confidence in his strength and his power it releases a dimension of Shalom a dimension of peace Shalom is not just peace as defined by by saying the absence of conflict or war but the Shalom of God is a level of wholeness it's a level of completeness okay it's a level of Union this amplified brings it out so beautifully be empowered through your union with him experience wholeness and completeness as you draw near to the Lord in your thoughts in your mind and what you think on your life is going to follow you lead your life not by your actions no your actions are the result of your thoughts you lead your life by what you think about what you think about is what you're going to become the Bible said out out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh and the Bible also says as a man thinketh in his heart think about that as a man thinketh in his heart it's not talking about the brain it's talking about the mind as a man thinketh in his heart so he is one translation said so he is what he thinks he is he is no I tell you that's a powerful phrase because if you allow the enemy to convince you that you're a failure and a loser and unsavable and unredeemable and and a wretch and can never never be anything you are you really are what you have allowed the enemy to convince you you are you won't you won't succeed at anything you want to accomplish anything but it's not because you really are those things it's because you've you have believed it in your own heart and you've confessed it with your own mouth that's why lies are the biggest fiery darts that the enemy is shooting against the body of Christ in this hour I've got the shield of faith I'm gonna stop those fiery darts and again that's not automatic remember how we do that let's let's let's look at those lies those negative thoughts as fiery darts and remember in this study we gave you some of the keys of how we pull down those strongholds casting down imaginations and that's how we deal with those fiery darts i I was almost going to go backward in my notes but if you missed any of this series I invite you to the web to YouTube because every one of these programs are available on YouTube and if it's a new program you're watching it may not be there right this moment but it will be in a few days and so you can go to youtube and you can watch them at your convenience and I know an hour is a long time but YouTube is kind of handy because if you watch it and you watch a portion of it and you go back later on the same browser to watch it it have a little over there and you can press it and it'll show you where you're left off and you can just take up and go right on and one of the ways to get updated so that you'll know when we add a new program is to subscribe I think we we have maybe 1,200 subscribers I'd like to have I'd like to have 25,000 I'd like to have a hundred thousand not so that I could brag I'm not a preacher who has ever based my life and ministry on numbers but so that I could know that what we're doing is affecting more and more people blessing strengthening encouraging more and more people I have the easiest part of this job I just come in here and do what I love doing trying to find the channel of God's anointing and expounding to you the word as God has opened it up to me and I know I fall short many times explaining things and making them as clear to you as God has made them to me but I do the very best I can but there's there's brothers behind the scenes who work much harder than I do to make this happen a brother who handles the video portion and a brother who handles the audio portion and all that goes into that this would not be possible without them and then you consider the gospel channel the programs have to be played they have to be put in the computer system and they had those people have to believe God for the finances to pay for the satellite to pay for the cable so that it can come to you I want you to know this is a huge labor of love much bigger than what a lot of people realize and so when you partner with us with the gospel channel in your prayers and in your support you then become an active player a partner in what God is doing every one of these needs and the prayers that are being prayed over them and because you made it possible and when these testimonies begin to come in you've got a part in the blessing you have a part in it because you've been fed that's how it works so I won't go back I was tempted but I won't go back and and reteach what we've already covered but you find it on YouTube you go back and get it on YouTube new hope revival ministries now let's go on in the amplified for just a moment before my time gets completely away from me but on the whole armour of God oh I gotta go back to verse 10 in conclusion be strong in the Lord be empowered through your union with him I can hardly say that without choking draw your strength from him I want you to know your true strength doesn't come from vitamins or as we say an Alabama vitamins your true strength doesn't come from your mineral supplements and I believe in all of those things and I use them in my life that helps my physical body but I want you to know your true strength comes from the Lord and when we recognize that it it behooves us it compels us to want to be even more connected to him when we can recognize that he is our true source then you are not gonna let I'm not gonna let anything come between me and my source and so when doubt starts creeping in I gotta kick it out and when other past-times begin to rob me of my God time of my union time my fellowship time I gotta cut that out now I enjoy certain certain aspects of social media I do I enjoy certain aspects of Facebook and I enjoy certain aspects of Instagram and I'm not too much into Twitter but I'm there you can find me there but it's just because I I forget to tweet you know but I'm there there's certain aspects of it that make me make me crazy you know angry upset they disturb my peace but there are certain aspects of staying connected that I absolutely love one for instance I'll give you this example a few years ago I went through several surgeries one of them a little more serious than the others and one was a colon surgery and then the other were both foot surgeries and there was some recovery time involved etc and it changed my life for a period of time and and you know I'm a I can be a private person to a certain extent but hey I needed prayer and I just blurted it out I mean I just put it out I'm on my way to you know for surgery and and I cannot tell you the strength that I got when I was able now for the first day you know after colon surgery I don't remember a whole lot I remember the first time the same day they got me up to walk and I didn't want to walk I wanted to hurt somebody in fact but I didn't but I remember walking and and I don't remember a whole lot about it but by the next day I was able to look on Facebook and see the hundreds of people that were praying for me and I had a hard road to go for a few days that was very sick the pain medicine made me very sick but any chance I could could get to read what people were saying and their well wishes and their prayers was strength to me and so even though there's a lot of junk involved in some of that there can also be a lot of strength in that you can find our ministry on Facebook new hope revival ministries is there you can find us on Instagram because I think it's a smart idea to use as many avenues as we possibly can to let people know we're in this for the long haul that this is the you know we want to be the real deal we're not trying to build a ministry we're trying to help build a part of the kingdom of God and that's why I'm so thankful for the gospel Channel I pastor a small Church in Alabama and we have quite a few streamers around the world people who stream our service is live at revival org and they're connected and some of those people paid our tithes and some send offerings to help us do what we do so we have an extended community but I wouldn't be speaking to you most likely today if it weren't for the gospel channel if it was not for the sacrifice that they have made brother Eric Erickson has made all of these years so let's pray a little extra for them let's do what we can to keep that ministry expanding because then that gives our ministry and many many other ministries and opportunity to keep expanding getting our pulpit a little bit larger I keep getting off on these little bunny trails but that's okay it's alright because sometimes the Lord can be in the bunny trails too he can speak to somebody through those little bunny trail Center you know those little little anyway let's look at this again be empowered through you draw your strength from him we get certain amount of strength I think that's how I was starting we get certain amount of strength from one another it helps us to know that folk are praying but at the end of this what if it's just you and the Lord are you gonna be a weak puddle on the floor no because if you are walking with the Lord his joy is your strength his peace is your strength his spirit becomes your strength that strength which his boundless might provides praise God verse 11 put on God's whole armor all of it the armor of a heavy armed soldier that's who you are which God supplies where does the armor come from it comes from God it's the armor of God the armor of Lord that you may be able to that you may be able successfully to stand up against all the strategies and the deceits of the devil the schemes and devices of the devil for we are not wrestling with flesh and blood contending only with physical opponents but against despotisms against the powers against the master spirits who are the world rulers of this present darkness against the spirit forces of wickedness in the heavenly supernatural sphere that's what we were talking about a few moments ago there's a force behind a lot of what you're going through right now it's not just the people that you know involved but there's oftentimes something much darker much larger that's behind the scene but thanks be to God my union with him gives me strength and empowers me to deal with all of that I don't care how high I don't care what authority the enemy comes with we were talking about ranks in the angelic and in the demonic I don't care if the king of all the demons comes if we know who we are who's we are if we are drawing our strength from the Lord and from his word we do not have to fear the enemy don't you let fear rule your life sure they're scary things that happen especially in the realm of darkness are in the realm of the New Age or witchcraft or the demonic sure there are some scary things that happen but greater is He that is in me in you than he that is in the world behold I give you power jesus said over certain lower levels of of wickedness or certain ranks no that's not what he said is it I give you power over all the powers of the enemy so when we know that we are in union with him in relationship and fellowship with them when we know that we are drawing our strength from him it doesn't matter what rank the enemy is or how how many there are we have great peace we have confidence that the Lord is going to get us through every bit of it therefore put on God's complete armor that you may be able to resist and stand your ground not giving the enemy a millimeter not giving the enemy an inch because as we sometimes say if you give the devil an inch he'll never stop with an inch Willy he'll take the mile you give the enemy a millimeter and he's gonna want a kilometre he's gonna want to come in and take more and more and more and more I believe it was the last time that we were together we were talking about dethroning Satan dethroning the enemy in our life moving him off the throne so that God can establish his kingdom where the enemy has come in as a squatter and built his throne his high place over your life my thank God that we have a force we have a God with us who has all power against all the enemy all right he says put on the on God's complete armor that you may be able to resist and stand your ground on the evil day of danger and having done all the crisis demands to stand firmly in your place uh uh there I'm not giving up any ground at all therefore stand there for verse 14 hold your ground having tightened I like it having tightened the belt of truth around your loins you know that is the girding of the loins that is the girdle of truth that the Old Testament talks about this translation uses the belt of truth and tightening that and of course you know the scripture talks about girding up your loins for running and that was tucking in the the longer tales of the of the garment and tucking it in that tightened girdle or that tighten belt so that the legs would be more free to run think about the fact that this the the the thigh area the loin area that is a portion of the core of the body and that's where our strength is we really need to strengthen the core of our bodies physically as well as spiritually and so this is not just any belt or any any girdle or any tightening mechanism but this is the belt of truth so we are strengthening our core so that we can stand longer and firmer against the onslaught of the enemy and what are we strengthening our core with what are we strengthening our our loins our thighs our hips with we are strengthening it with T are you th truth and truth is not just a doctrine it's not just a particular Bible passage truth is a person jesus said I am the way I am the truth I am the life so we're literally strengthening our core by by belting on by tightening the Lord Jesus his word his truth around that part of our body strengthening us to stand longer strengthening ourselves to run faster to endure with greater strength and greater vitality I like that so much hold your ground having tightened the belt of truth around your loins and having put on the breastplate remember King James says of righteousness but the amplified here says the breastplate of integrity and of moral rectitude and right standing with God I want to I want to say something about that you know integrity is an interesting word because integrity is measured by by what you do when no one is looking when no one is around we can perform for the for the folk around us but when we choose to do the right thing when the opportunity presents itself to do the wrong thing and we choose the right thing anyway and no one would know no one would know that we that we took the wrong path no one would know that we took something perhaps it wasn't ours but we choose not to do that because there is a there's a level of integrity that God has helped to establish in our lives but I also want you to look at this it it defines righteousness here in the amplified as not just integrity or our moral rectitude but right standing with God now how can we stand right with God that's what righteousness is a right standing or standing right with God how can we do that well I'll tell you we cannot do it in the flesh with our human effort we cannot attain true righteousness true right standing with God but it's by our union with him it's by letting him be our identity finding our identity in him it's by allowing him to live his righteousness in us for us through us that's how we can use the breastplate of righteousness it's it's beyond it's not just the breastplate of our moral right standing or our integrity or our righteousness but it's the breastplate of his righteousness it's letting his truth become a breastplate in our life and his holiness his integrity his righteousness I'll tell you sometimes we can hardly make the right choice without his strength sometimes the enemy is screaming in our ear you just do that nobody will know it's just one little thing that kind of that kind of struggle can go on and you could be swept away I could be swept away in one moment of yielding to this golden opportunity so to speak that the enemy places before us and and I tell you I've been in a situation or two like that on my Christian journey and I did not have within me maybe the strength to make the right decision on my own but I recognize that it's so important to recognize that I didn't feel defeated I just felt powerless to do the right thing it was a big situation and it would have been so easy to have yielded to the voice but how did I get out of it not by not by saying I've always made the right decision so I'll just make the right decision no it was by crying out to God I do not have the strength to choose the right path this time alone I need your strength I need an impartation of your integrity if I face this alone I'm very likely to fall but if I can know in my heart that you're facing this with me and that by choosing the right thing I'm pleasing you and you're going to cover me and protect me and you're going to become my breastplate of righteousness in this battle I can do it I can choose the right thing I can turn down the golden opportunity that the enemy has offered me and settle seemingly for for taking the right path which is going to be you know less productive it appears and and certainly not as much finance involved and not as much ease involved and it's going to be a harder path but I was able to do that because I remembered if if this whole thing is depending on my ability to always have integrity and do the right thing we may get in trouble but I have another source I have another source of strength I have another source of integrity I have another source of moral uprightness and righteousness it's his it's his righteousness that he's making available to me in God's armor I hope that speaks to you and how important is the armor well it protects two of the most vital organs of the body and maybe more it protects the lungs you got to have lungs to breathe and it protects the heart which is the blood pump for the entire body that breastplate of his righteousness not because of his race justise I'm gonna do the right thing because of his righteousness I'm gonna move in integrity but I must remember that my source of being morally upright is him my strength to do the right thing is from him well my time is gone but I have thoroughly enjoyed our time together in the word and if I offend you by raising my voice I almost apologize but it's the only way I know it gets good it just gets good sometimes the Word of God is life to us and
