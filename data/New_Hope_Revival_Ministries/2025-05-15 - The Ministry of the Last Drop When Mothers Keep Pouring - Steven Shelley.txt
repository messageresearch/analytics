Description:
Inspired by the powerful story in 2 Kings 4:1-7, "The Ministry of the Last Drop" speaks directly to the heart of motherhood—when mothers feel emptied and overwhelmed, yet continue pouring out love, care, and devotion. Even in moments of exhaustion, when it seems there's nothing left to give, God meets mothers exactly where they are, multiplying their smallest efforts into abundant blessings. This message reminds every mother that their seemingly insufficient strength is precisely where God's miraculous provision begins.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. The last drop. The ministry of the last drop. When mothers pour from empty, when their tank is empty, when their supply is limited, the real heart of motherhood kicks in and they take from the little supply that they have. and they pour out and they pour out and they pour out and they pour out because reality is nobody can pour out in a home like a mother can. I want to say to every mother in this house and beyond. When you feel like you've given everything you have, when you feel like your tank is empty and you have absolutely nothing to give, don't you stop pouring because there's a God who's on board with you. There's a God in your life who'll meet you at the place of your dedication. Here I am, Lord. You know my nerves are frazzled. You know, my husband has put too much of this load on me. Let me tell you something. They You might be limited on what you can say to him, but you're not limited what you can say to the Lord. Tell the Lord on him. Come on. Somebody said, "I don't go along with that." You ought to tell the Lord everything. Just how you feel. I learned a long time ago. He understand. He may not agree with me, but he understands how I feel. He understands how I feel. Keep pouring, mama. Keep pouring. You may look down and it may look like there's not even a drop sliding off the end of the vessel into one of your children, but God is there to fan the flame. God is there to multiply the oil. God is there to bless your effort. Mamas, you may never feel full. You may never feel like you've got enough to give. Come on. But you've got more than you understand. Because there's somebody else living in your shoe leather. There's somebody else living on the inside of you. He'll meet you at your commitment. He'll meet you at your dedication. You lay those little babies up on the Lord's lap and say, "I can only do so much. I need your help with the rest." I want you to know he'll come swooping in faster than a Superman. He'll give you what you need if you let him. If you'll make King Jesus your first resource instead of your last resort, you'll keep pouring and pouring and pouring. And one of these days, those children who seemingly don't appreciate you enough now will come around and praise you and bless you because you poured into them when you felt like you had nothing. If you will recommmit and reconsecrate, sister your life, your motherhood, your service to your family, if you'll just keep saying, "Lord, I'm running low. I need some more oil. I need some more meal. I need some more strength to continue to do what you've called me to do." He'll meet you. He'll meet you at your point of need. Let the weak say, I'm going to be able. I am strong. I'm going to do what I've purposed in my heart because he is strong in me. Our vocabulary dictates a lot of circumstances in our lives. Do you believe that? Snared by the words of our mouth, we are the scripture said, "Mama, what do you have? You've stood around the altar Sunday after Sunday. You've told the Lord, "I'm empty. I need you to pass by. I'm discouraged. I need you to help me. My children in trouble. I need you to help me." You've told the Lord over and over again. Now, the word of the Lord is unto you today. He's asking you the question, "What is it in your house? What do you have? You've told me what you don't have. You don't have enough support. you don't have maybe enough support even from your husband, the father of your children. You you've told the Lord that now the Lord is asking what do you have? And I'm asking you mothers, what do you have? You may feel like you have nothing. No energy, no patience, no answers, but God works with your accept. Except a small part. God works with your accept. That tiny bit of faith, that last ounce of love, that small prayer, a small song, calling on the name of Jesus, speaking his name over your children. God will work with your except you're not enough is God's starting point. It's not his limitation. Can I tell you that what you need to save your children and bless your community is in your house? It's where God has placed you. It's where he puts you. It's where he's going to feed you. It's where he's going to sustain you. You tell the devil he's a liar.
