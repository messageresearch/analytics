========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right Weist in you the hope award [Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of New Hope revival ministries right here in Smith Station Alabama and I'm coming to you again today with our partnership with the gospel channel we so appreciate the work of the Lord that they are accomplishing and we are very blessed that we get to be a part of that outreach and so once again we invite you to pray for the gospel channel pray for brother Eric Erickson and the staff that God will anoint them that God will direct their thoughts that he will give them grace and wisdom and that there will be provision needed to maintain what the Lord has already opened up the doors that are already open and I would like for you to agree with me that there will be new doors of opportunity open for the gospel channel we feel very blessed because wherever the gospel channel goes new hope revival ministry gets to go with them and I pray that you have been blessed by the programs that we have been doing for many years we came to you on the gospel channel through the Eagles cry and that's a program that we would like to revive we would like to do that again and that's certainly in our plans and it's a matter of Prayer 30-minute program that aired several times a week but we feel very blessed to have this opportunity to come to you during this time slot and we get a whole hour which it might be a little harder for you to stay with me an hour but it's a whole lot easier for me I appreciate the extra time because quite often it takes me a while to get rolling and then when I when I get rolling I have a hard time coming to a stop if you miss a program in a particular series that we do we have made them available for you on YouTube if you'll just do a search for New Hope revival ministries you will find our YouTube channel you will also find a button there that you can subscribe so that when we add new content to our channel you'll be notified and don't forget to look into downloading our new hope revival ministries app it is available on the different app stores of your platform whatever you are using for your smartphone or your tablet and we've been getting good response because all of the programming is available there there's music there there are some archived sermons from a generation ago that will be a great blessing to you in your life I know they will and so check that out also you can visit our ministry website at revival dot o-r-g we have also various social media accounts where from time to time we are posting our videos and we have something called new hope moments that are just small nuggets that are taken from our live preaching services and the Lord has really been using them I look just a few minutes ago and one that was just posted very very recently had already been viewed 1,000 times on Facebook and of course we have no way of knowing how many times it's viewed on the app and on YouTube and all of the different ways that we have but we are just looking for whatever the Lord will direct us to to get the good news out and we want to be an inspiration to you and we want you to know that God is still the same we say this almost every time we be together Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and we just believe that God wants to move in our lives he wants to move in your life individually and he wants to show himself real and strong and if you'll allow him I believe you hold the key if you will allow him he will come and remind you in many various ways that he loves you that he cares about you and that he sees your need I know so often we feel alone in this life in this world we sometimes we have friends but no there's just certain ways we feel and things we go through that we feel like there's no one we can tell but I want you to know that you can always go to Jesus he is available and I I know when we pray we we want to be respectful and we want to lay it out with with great honor for the one who loves us so much but I also want you to know that he's a friend that sticketh closer than a brother and you can just tell God you know you can just open up your heart and tell him what's going on and what you need from him and he'll direct you he will answer and I think we mentioned a few programs back that that old song that precious sister used to sing in our church he may not come when you want him but he's right on time and truly God is a known time God we have been talking last time we were together about unfresh anointing and we came to that thought because of something that the Lord had been speaking to us about in our local church our local ministry he was introducing us to a new season he was inviting us into a new season with him and a new season means there's going to be change and sometimes change is uncomfortable but change is necessary and change is inevitable if we ever want to go beyond where we are right now not be stuck then there has to be change there really has to be change and so we pray for change we believe that that is part of what God wants to execute in our lives but we also understand that you and I have some power we have some authority according to the scripture to bring about some change in our own lives and in our own circumstances and sometimes the change that we really need is something internal something within we talked about the last time we were together changing our thoughts how important that is because if we can change our thoughts we begin to change our words and with our thoughts and our words being corrected and coming into alignment with God's truth about our lives then change becomes inevitable and we begin to move forward into what the Lord has for us and so we're what we want to go back today I want to go back and begin to talk to you a little bit more about that fresh anointing that God is sending upon those who who step up and begin to cry out for it you know if we know something's available and we don't we don't bother to pursue it then then we're the ones who lose but when we begin to hear the Lord saying in our services prophetically that he wanted to send a fresh anointing to help us with the new season well I just step up in faith and I say me let me be first I want and desire a fresh experience with the presence of Jesus Christ I know that we can't live by experience we have to live by faith but God loves you so much that he wants you to experience the realness of his presence we were sharing with you the scripture from Isaiah that tells us because of the anointing the yoke is destroyed and then toward the end of our program the last time we shared Psalm 92 10 but my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of a unicorn I shall be anointed with fresh oil and we were even declaring that together I am anointed with fresh oil I want to just read a couple of statements that I shared with you the last time we were together and then move on to another portion of the lesson today the anointing is not a feeling not an idea not an emotion not an atmosphere the anointing is a knowing and assurance that comes by revelation a divine empowering to carry us through the next assignment and the next season can I read that line again the anointing is a divine empowering to carry us through the next assignment and season can you say I want that I want that in my life I truly do when we say the word Christ that word was transliterated from the Greek word Christos and that word Christos means very much like it's it's at the equivalent to the Hebrew word that means The Anointed One the Messiah the Messiah so Christ is the anointing he is the Anointed One The Fountainhead of all anointing is the Lord Jesus Christ the root of David Earth's one true Messiah we must never look at the anointing as a thing but rather the presence of a person the person of the Lord Jesus Christ so if we are praying for a new anointing or if the Lord promises that he wants to give to us a new anointing it means a fresh encounter with the presence of the Lord I don't know about you but I love to experience the presence of the Lord I think that is probably one of the reasons why I feel so passionate about praise and worship is because when we begin to praise Him and worship Him when we allow praise to be created as the fruit of our lips when we align our hearts with him it is almost inevitable that we will begin to feel the presence of the Lord the Bible says that he lives in he inhabits the praises of his people so when we praise Him he comes to live to make himself known in those praises our praise becomes the atmosphere for his presence to be ushered in and I have come to love that presence there is a song that we sing sometime I love your presence and someone questioned me one time very well meaning not being critical at all young person and they said brother Shelly is it all right to love the presence aren't we supposed to love the Lord Jesus and I said yes of course we must love the Lord Jesus Christ but if we love him we're going to love where he comes we're going to love to experience him and when we experience him that's what we're feeling that's what we're touching his presence the Old Testament uses the word glory which is the kavod the heavy weightiness of the presence of God and I want you to know that I live to feel to experience that glory that presence I don't have a feeling driven faith I have a faith driven feeling I love to feel and to experience but I want you to know that a feeling is not enough to keep you coming back a feeling is not enough to keep you pressing through the valley when when it gets hard when the doctor's report is bad when when everything around you is crumbling when you've lost your best friend when your marriage is falling apart and your children are wandering from God a feeling is not enough you'll have to have something more than that you'll have to have a faith filled relationship with Jesus Christ but oh how sweet it is to feel him to have his presence come and touch our lives or to be able to reach out in faith in praise in prayer in worship and know that we have touched his presence so yes the answer is it's alright to love his presence as long as you understand that it's more than a feeling it is a divine atmosphere a divine reminder that our Lord Jesus Christ is in the room by the power of the Holy Ghost and he will come to you in that anointing he will come to you in that presence wherever you are when you need him if you're willing to reach out in faith believing he can show up I'll tell you he has shown up for me many many many times so we're not looking at the anointing like a thing like a feeling but we're recognizing that it is a person the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and we have come to understand and we should that there are levels and dimensions and intensities of his presence the anointing we don't always encounter his presence the same way every time there are levels dimensions degrees intensities of that presence but I love them all I do sometimes the presence of the Lord comes and it feels so sweet so loving and so precious sometimes the presence of God comes and it feels earth-shattering it feels like everything within you it's going to be broken up because the intensity of his glory becomes so powerful but I love all all the expressions I love all of the intensities of his presence and I tell you once you've encountered the anointing you're spoiled you'll never be satisfied with dry formal religion ever again once you know that as a Holy Ghost filled believer washed in the blood of Jesus baptized in its precious name you have access to that presence once you learn that you'll never be satisfied with just a form any longer denying the power but you'll be reaching out for more of the presence and more of the power of God everything we do in Christ is is an upward climb really it's a journey and we're moving closer to Co and closer to the end of this journey where we step out of this dimension of time and into the dimension of eternity I like to use these expressions from Romans 1:17 Psalm 84 7 and 2nd Corinthians 3:18 we are journeying from glory to glory from strength to strength from faith to faith and I love that because it helps me to understand the faith I have right now is leading me to a deeper faith the glory that I experience right now is making room and taking me forward to experience helping me be positioned to experience more glory and the strength that I have right now is sustained me for what I'm walking through right now but this strength gives way leads forward to more strength when I have need of it it is indeed a journey and so sometimes we just have to remind ourselves I've got a journey on I've got to press on toward the mark there are many many voices calling out to get our attention and there are many things that happen in life to discourage us to make us want to lay down and give up and quit but you cannot you must not you've got to get back up and keep pressing toward Christ each new season in our lives brings new assignments new connections new testings and trials there will be new choices to make there will be new territories to explore and there will be new temptations with all of that newness with all of that change it's reasonable for me to believe that I will need a new fresh touch of God's oil of his anointing of his glory the enemies that have been defeated in the past season they will regather they will they will you know or reorganize is the word I was looking for and they'll come at you maybe not the same way that they did in the last season they'll find another way to come at you but the truth is the same victory that God gave you in the last season is available for you in the new season and it's made even more possible by a fresh touch of his anointing a fresh oil that comes from his hand therefore that new level of anointing becomes necessary to navigate the unchartered path that lies before us when God invites us into a new season we will need to be filled with greater glory than we experienced in previous seasons the process and the progression of stepping into both fresh and deeper places in the anointing is carefully illustrated by the experience that Ezekiel had with the healing River that is promised to flow from the Millennial temple I want to read that with you today I want us to take a look at that it is found in Ezekiel chapter 47 and the first nine verses of Ezekiel 47 and because there are nine verses in this text I'm going to read a little quicker all right so that we can get through all nine verses afterward he brought me again under the door of the house and behold waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward for the forefront of the house stood toward the east and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house at the south side of the altar then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward and behold there ran out waters on the right side and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward he measured a thousand cubits and he brought me through the waters the waters were to the ankles again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters the waters were to the knees again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters were to the loins afterward he measured a thousand and it was a river that I could not pass over for the waters were risen waters to swim in a river that could not be passed over and he said unto me son of man has thou seen this then he brought me and caused me to return to the brink of the river now when I had returned behold at the bank of River were very many trees on the one side and on the other then said he unto me these waters issue out toward the east country and go down into the desert and go into the sea which being brought forth Indus to see the waters shall be healed and it shall come to pass that everything that liveth which moveth whithersoever the river shall come shall live and there shall be a very great multitude of fish because these waters shall come thither for they shall be healed and everything shall live whither the river cometh this was Ezekiel's experience with a healing river that flowed forth from the altar of that Millennial temple that Ezekiel prophesied about a water a river that will flow down from the temple down into the valley all the way down that route from Jerusalem toward Jericho and beyond to where the Jordan River empties into the Dead Sea we know that there is no life in the Dead Sea we used to could say that with such assurance and such certainty but we have found out in the past few years that there are a few places in the Dead Sea where a little fresh stream of water is poking up out of the bottom of the Dead Sea just a little spring of water just about is narrow as your finger and I saw a video myself of this tiny little I guess they're single-celled organisms little plankton that live only in the area the parameter of that little bit of living water fresh water that comes out of that spring if those little creatures swim beyond the stream the little little place where that stream is coming up they die because the mineral content is so strong so heavy in the Dead Sea that nothing can live but Ezekiel had an experience that there would be a river that would flow from the altar of the temple right down into the Dead Sea and wherever that River went oh how prophetic that is wherever that River went it carried life and things would live that were touched by that River eventually washing fish down into the Dead Sea where they have never lived and even in the miry places and the marshy places life would come because of that healing River I love the way that the Spirit Illustrated this to Ezekiel by taking a measuring rod or a measuring device and going forward 1000 cubits which is approximately a quarter of a mile a cubit and their variations of thought but a cubit is about 18 inches or one and a half feet he walked about 1,500 feet or the length of five football fields the water would begin to get deeper and deeper as he walked out the 1000 cubits that had been measured for him by this messenger of the Lord his first stop was a place where the water ran to the ankles meaning that only the feet were submerged beneath the water that speaks to us about our walk our daily walk I want you to know that our daily walk is very important how we live for Jesus Christ every day is very very important our consistency and our testimony is such an important part of who we are as ambassadors for Jesus Christ because people are watching us you know people expect to be a hypocrite they expect me to be a hypocrite to say one thing and do another I don't like it when people tell me well I would go to church but every church is filled with hypocrites and when they tell me that I often say to them well the hypocrite is closer to God than you are because you're putting the hypocrite between you and God that means that the position of the hypocrite is closer to God than the one you're standing in we should have no excuse yes you're right there are many people who confess one thing and live another thing but God's got an anointing he has an overflow of his Spirit to help us fresh oil to help us in our daily walk we need to come to that place in the leadership of the Spirit that our feet our walk has been submerged beneath that healing water that living water you see I see these different degrees of water levels of water measures of water as God's saying to Ezekiel as you journey on as you continue following the messenger of the Lord you'll get out into the strength to strength faith to faith you'll get out into that place where grace gives way to greater grace and glory gives way to greater glory you can't choose to stay in one level of what God desires to do in your life you've got to receive all that there is to receive in this season and then reach forward to the next season do you understand what I'm sharing with you today when we look at that walk that is represented to us in Ezekiel's experience by the river water submerging his feet or just covering his feet walk is often used in the scripture for a conduct in life our general demeanor and our department in life it has been said that Enoch and Noah walked with God it means their life was very very consistent they maintained a course of action conformed to God's will and one that was acceptable in his sight in the Old Testament and in the New Testament we find God promising to walk with his people and in his people on the other hand desiring the influence of the Holy Spirit we desire that Holy Spirit to be with us as well that we might walk in the statues of God that comes from hungers Bible Dictionary that is a source that many of you will be familiar with after Ezekiel had walked to the first point where the water was just above the ankles a thousand cubits the Spirit of the Lord and the messenger of the Lord led him to go farther another 1000 cubits and the waters came to his knees when we read about knees in the Bible it speaks to us of both our prayer life and our worship the need to bow the knee is to perform an act of worship kneeling in prayer was a practice of great antiquity and references are made in both the Old Testament and the New Testament knees are used symbolically for persons even in job 4:4 and Hebrews 12:12 and that also comes from the hungers Bible dictionary so what we see is that there is one place in God where he's covering us in our walk with Him and as we move deeper in the spirit River in the healing River we come to a place where the water is up to our knees because I believe is zekiel is an example to the believer of how we grow in grace and how we grow with the intensity of the spirit so now the water is flowing to the knees and it means my prayer life is anointed not only is my walk my devotion my testimony anointed but now my walk but now my worship and my prayer life is anointed with God its anointed by the Holy Spirit of God and then the messenger of the Lord went forward another 1000 cubits measuring it out carefully Ezekiel walking along and he comes to a place where the Bible said that the water was to the loins and this is an area of the body identified in Scripture with with reproductive life and so we understand by looking at different sources that literally this means the parts of the back and the sides of the human or the animal body that parallel the spine on each side extending between the ribs and the hips and it is used as a euphemism for reproductive power so now Ezekiel's walk has been anointed now his prayer life and worship has been anointed by this healing River and now his witness because one of the ways that we see Christ reproduced the life of Christ reproduced is by walking consistently our testimony and our witness being something that shows oh my demonstrators what a life surrendered to God really looks like if we want to make a difference you know we can talk all day long about the goodness of God and how wonderful it is to be saved and to be a Christian but if our life is not demonstrating that then nobody's really going to want to go through all the grind if it's not going to produce anything in in our life and so I love the fact that it starts off Lord help me get my daily walk straightened out and then let me learn the importance of prayer and praise and worship and then let me come in to another level of anointing of spirit life that will help me understand how I can reproduce this life how I can reflect this life in such a way others will also desire to know him in a greater way and then the next thing you know the messenger of the Lord goes forward another 1000 cubits and DeCicco walks along and he finds a river that cannot be passed over he finds waters to swim in now his whole body can be submerged he couldn't swim in ankle deep water I doubt he could have swam very good in knee-deep water maybe law in deep he could have he could have moved around and swimming a little bit but oh my when he came to that place that the waters were so deep they couldn't be passed over he described that as waters to swim in to be totally submerged in and I believe God has got spirit life for you like that I believe indeed there is a healing River like that and experience for you where you are absolutely submerged in the Spirit of God in the anointing of the Holy Ghost until everything about you is transformed by the life of Jesus Christ this is a representation of fullness of harvest of revival a total submersion completely surrounded by God's greater glory there is there was a word that was given in our church some years ago a prophetic word that was recorded and it reads like this there is such muddy water in the prophetic movement today across the land but I desire to send a clean wave I I just say yes Lord we need a pure river a clean wave let me read another wave of glory will soon roll in pure from the thrown waters to swim in that was a fennec word of the Lord given in our services many years ago promising us that there would be another pure wave of water from the throne of God waters to swim in to be totally submerged in greater glory I believe that that is our promise and I believe that we may very well be entering into that season where we are not just up to our ankles or up to our knees are up to our loins but we are being offered an opportunity to come in to the deeper realms of God's Holy Ghost spirit His Holy Ghost power and what does that do it doesn't just give us a feeling it takes us in to greater depths of Revelation we are not changed by feeling we are not changed by presence we are changed by the Word of God as it is revealed to us by the Spirit if we can get in an atmosphere of greater glory than we are in a position at that moment to listen more carefully to discern more clearly what God's Word is saying to us the Bible repeats this phrase he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit is saying to the church how many of you know that that hearing is not just letting the sound pass through your ear but giving heed to a real listening Lord I value your word oh I wish that you would be able to come to a place that you see the importance the value of having a real revelation from the Word of God we talked about it the last time we were together you know you can you can have experience after experience that will bless you and and strengthen you encourage you but but mine when life gets to beating you around and knocking you down you've got to have more than the memory of a feeling that you had when you were encountering the presence of the Lord you've got to have some truth I tell you there is nothing to defeat the enemy like the truth of God's Word once it has been revealed in the hearts of men and women we take that then like a weapon and my what God can accomplish in our lives so don't be satisfied with one dimension of his anointing one level one place of intensity in his spirit but let the Spirit of God stir in you a hunger a desire for those deeper places to swim in we got to get help with our walk we do we've got to learn to walk consistently we've got to get help with our prayer life we've got to see the value of real praise and worship and and certainly we've got to have some help with our reproductive ability our witness has got to be a a and Nene we've got to be living a life that is so consistent with what the Word of God says that people see it and desire it and they even seek us out asking what's going on in your life can I have some of that Oh wouldn't that be wonderful if you walk down the high street and someone comes to you and begins to say what is that I feel when you pass by I'm interested in that how do you get some of that all that be such a great opportunity wouldn't it for you to open your mouth and let the Lord fill it as you begin to tell them what it really means to have that kind of experience with God that's waters to swim in when you get to that place where where your your walk is anointed your your prayer life and your worship life is in order you've got to that place where you're you're really reproducing the power of God the resurrection life with your own testimony and then you move into that place of greater glory oh my I believe God has some experiences for us in the word I new places of Revelation in the word that will will make oh what differences it has already made in our lives and what a difference it will make if we keep moving on don't stop don't stay too long where you are now keep reaching for the new season keep reaching for what God has for you in the next place so we not only see the progressions of the glory of the Spirit of the anointing in this experience with Ezekiel but we really can see it demonstrated in the life and ministry of David how David moved from one glory one anointing to another and each level of anointing brought greater glory and the greater glory gave him greater influence it also brought greater responsibility and I want you to know the more of God's glory his spirit his anointing that you carry in your life the greater the responsibility will be that accompanies that greater demonstration of God's Spirit we are more responsible the more of God's power the more of his anointing he gives us the more responsible we are to carefully guard and protect that presence to to do carefully make sure that we are guarding that anointing and that we are taking responsibility for the authority that comes with that greater glory we can't be careless I think we could sum this up by saying we can't play Church when we come into that place of waters to swim in when we come into that place of of deeper anointing we can't play around anymore it's it's serious business there is a great responsibility on our shoulders if we can identify ourselves with the Bride of Christ there's a great responsibility on our shoulders to walk in the truth and to carefully use the authority that God has given us there there are some teaching out there in the Pentecostal and charismatic world that is so careless when it comes to the anointing and the and the authority and the power of God in our lives and it is sometimes taught and and demonstrated in such a flippant way but I want you to know there's a glory presence that paralyzes you there is an intensity of God's presence where you can't I believe in worship I tell you I do I believe the Bible said dance before the Lord I believe in that I believe in lifting up my hands and giving God praise I believe in leaping for joy when God touches your life but I want you to know there's a place in that presence where you don't hardly want to breathe it's not that you're afraid that God is going to destroy you it's the fear of the Lord it's the reverence that reverential fear of the Lord that we don't want to disturb or take for granted what God is doing in our midst I've experienced that on on small levels at times and my I'm telling you I have felt like I wanted to get under the carpet you want to go as low as you possibly can you are so overwhelmed so overjoyed so thrilled that you have touched that presence of God and that that presence of God has touched you you don't want to think a thought that would offend that presence that anointing of the person of the Lord Jesus Christ the church has got some we've got some growth to do after all these years there are people who have so stressed what it means to know God is your father that they have created an atmosphere that is void of the fear of the Lord we can be closed we can he can be our Papa he can be our Heavenly bridegroom we can lay on his chest and hear his heartbeat but I want you to know there is a reverential fear of the Lord who that comes in those levels of God's anointing and God's presence I would that you could come into that place and experience that because for me to try to explain it or describe what I have encountered a few short times in my life I don't have the ability to do it but have you if you ever should you ever experience for yourself one time you won't have to have it explained you may not be able to explain it but you you won't have to have anybody to talk about it because you'll know immediately you know it's so impacting and so life-changing from Scripture we discovered that David had three public anointings and that each time that anointing prepared him to step deeper into the destiny and into the authority that God had chosen David to walk in were all three necessary absolutely let me ask you this was it necessary for Ezekiel to come to water to his ankles before he could get to waters to swim in sure he had to pass through the water as you keep waiting out into the water the waters rise and so the same thing for David every one of those anointings was necessary every one of those anointings released a new level of authority and power in David's life and it gave him the grace to adjust to that new place of responsibility that God was calling him to he was ultimately chosen by God to be king over the United house of Israel both Israel and Judah both north and south but yet there was going to be a journey to get him there he was going to have to go from ankle-deep water knee-deep water law in deep water to get to those waters to swim in in 1st Samuel chapter 16 and verse 13 then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward this is such a lovely story in the Bible what a beautiful reminder I love reflecting on this and you know it well Jesse had all of these sons Samuel the Prophet was sent by the Lord to the house of Jesse to anoint the next king of Israel he gets there and he and all of Jesse's sons are lined up and that old prophet Samuel walks by with the Horn of oil in his hand and he says nope no this looks like a good one you know if you read the story it looks like a good one the Lord said no he goes on to the next one and maybe Sam will face mine this must be the one look at this good strong man he looks smart he looks handsome the Spirit of the Lord said no he goes all the way down the line and the Lord hasn't said yes to any of the sons of Jesse so he says to him have you any more sons and justice oh yes yes in fact I do I have one I have one little son oh he's not so much you know just kind of a ruddy little boy he's out watching the Sheep samuel says call for him and when David is brought before the prophet Samuel Samuel knows with everything that is within him this is the king what about it he passed by the most handsome the most intellectual the biggest strongest all the qualifications that man look for in a leader and found this little shepherd boy and samuel just takes off the lid of the Horn of oil and He pours it over his head in the midst of his brethren and guess what it wasn't just samuel that anointed David that day the Spirit of the Lord came upon him in verse 13 from that day forward what was Samuel doing he was pouring a horn of oil on Saul's successor God was getting ready to bring an end to the house of Saul and he was getting ready to bring in a new ruler a new king for Israel and it started when we look at that first anointing we associate it with the Hebrew word souk which means to pour out it can occasionally mean to smear over it's only used 8 times in the Bible in most of those cases it speaks of that oil being poured over the head according to the theological word book of the Old Testament that word soup primarily means pour as a pouring a pouring soup differs from its most common synonym masa or that is where we get the word mashach where we eventually get the word mushiya which includes the idea of of spreading a little bit or smearing a little bit when the anointing all was poured upon an individual in an Old Testament ceremony it ran down over the surfaces of the body because of the beautiful smell that excited the senses but but quickly dissipated soon evaporating and the fragrance quickly dwindled Psalm 133 one speaks about what an anointing would have looked like behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity and it talks about the oil that ran down Aaron's beard all the way down to the bottoms of his garment he was being covered in the anointing it was oil symbolizing spirit it flowed down covering the whole man this was really but the beginning of David's journey it was under this initial enabling this initial anointing that David killed both the lion and the bear so that first anointing that David Seve was good enough it was sufficient enough potent enough that he killed the lion in the bear it was under that same anointing just the first one that David killed Goliath and we know that David was less than 20 at that time because he was considered too young to fight the scripture says it and many people who have studied the life of David and tried to put it in some sort of timeline believe that David was about 17 years old when he killed Goliath that was a great anointing it was powerful enough to give him courage over the line in the bear to kill them and it gave him courage to slay the the Philistine giant Goliath who was tormenting harassing and mocking the armies of God but it did not immediately place David on the throne with full Dominion and full power over the promised territory and the jura ditch jurisdiction that would be a part of his destiny David would greatly need this anointing and enabling for the wilderness experience that was about to lay before him I want you to know after great victory David was going to know great wilderness he had known great plenty and power but he was about to know real heartache and real fear it was certainly going to try to take ahold of David's life it was evident that in order for David to rule over the United Kingdom of Israel something deeper was going to be needed to carry him farther toward God's ultimate plan for his life what was he going to need he was going to need a new encounter with God's presence he was going to need a new anointing he was going to need to move from the ankle deep to the knee deep to the loin deep to waters to swim in and I would dare say I believed I would be safe to say that if you are a son of God servant of the Lord Jesus Christ you're going to also need I'm going to also need more anointing fresh encounter with God's presence to prepare me for whatever it is that stands between my life now and the the promise of rapture resurrection I want to work for the Lord the rest of the days that I have on this earth I want to be able to do it with the best of my ability but I'm going to be depending more and more on his anointing and power so I have to journey on toward the fresh anointing especially when I'm moving into new seasons and into New Territories I want to pray for you the next time we come together we'll talk about the other two anointings in the life of David and how each one took him a little closer and a little closer until finally he stepped into the fullness of all that God wanted him to be you see you've been in preparation your life thus far has been a place of training and preparation for what God wants to use you for John the Baptist spent all those years in the wilderness getting ready for that few seconds of ministry when he would carry out the most important part of his destiny on earth and that was that beautiful day on the banks of the Jordan River when Jesus his cousin came to be baptized but it wasn't just his cousin that was coming it was so much more than that in John he didn't greet his cousin hey cuz I'm glad you've come today or no he said behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world this was an important part I believe the most important part of the life and Ministry of John the Baptist to forerun the first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to announce he's more than a man this is the son of God that has come to take away the sins of the world all of the years of training in the wilderness preparing him hardship hard-knocks preparing him and getting ready I'm ready for that few moments of ministry your life is being formed if you have surrendered if you have surrendered to the call of the Lord Jesus Christ your life is being prepared even now I'm so sorry for your pain I'm so sorry for many of the
