[43:55] brother gritty
[43:58] tell me if I did you know what we're
[44:00] glad to have you
[44:01] here uh we really are uh I want to ask
[44:05] you to pray about something that we
[44:07] didn't mention in the prayer request I
[44:09] don't want to exactly call it out
[44:12] because I don't want the enemy to have
[44:14] any room whatsoever to work but all of
[44:18] you know that we have lost the lease the
[44:21] 20 plus year lease on our apartment in
[44:25] Jerusalem
[44:26] and when I sent word today we have we
[44:29] have uh we have the apartment until the
[44:32] 28th of February we're very thankful for
[44:35] the time that we have left with it and
[44:37] of course brother Benny and uh fredman
[44:40] and his wife Naomi and their three
[44:42] children and mother-in-law right now are
[44:44] very glad that God has made a way for
[44:47] them to have a place to stay these years
[44:50] when I send him notice to let him know
[44:52] that I would be booking a ticket in the
[44:53] next few days uh to be there the last
[44:56] week of October and the first week of
[44:58] November to start going through a
[45:00] mountain of stuff the the basement if
[45:04] you've ever been in the basement you
[45:05] know how big it is brother Magnuson has
[45:07] been and it's piled to the ceiling and
[45:10] up the stairs because when we when we
[45:12] moved out of one apartment and combined
[45:15] two apartments worth of furniture into
[45:17] one we didn't have any storage so we
[45:20] just made storage Jonathan and it's
[45:22] piled to the ceiling and I see it almost
[45:24] every night in the middle of the night
[45:26] in my mind and it has really really
[45:28] caused a lot of concern when I sent the
[45:32] note to tell him we were going to be
[45:33] there he let me know what the
[45:34] arrangements would be and uh then he let
[45:38] me know that that there has been a
[45:40] slight turn in the situation and he was
[45:44] only notified of it most recently and
[45:47] may I just say that it could be amazing
[45:50] and it could be toward our
[45:52] advantage may I just say that and
[45:55] nothing else
[45:56] hopefully before the camp meeting is
[45:58] over I'll be able to let you know I feel
[46:01] the call to Jerusalem like like I
[46:03] haven't felt in years and so I will be
[46:06] going the Lord willing the end of of
[46:08] October anyway because there's a lot to
[46:10] start doing in the process but I want
[46:13] you to pray like wild people I mean like
[46:17] like holy
[46:19] ghost uh what do I want to say I I I
[46:23] don't know Warriors like Holy Ghost
[46:26] Warriors and ask the Lord for favor and
[46:30] to make a way where there seems to be no
[46:33] way we're having a hard time finding
[46:36] another place especially large enough
[46:39] like we have now it seems like we have a
[46:41] perfect place and uh we need God to move
[46:45] but I think he's moving I think he's
[46:47] moving I think he's moving and what a
[46:49] great day to hear about
[46:51] it after 5:00 this afternoon before the
[46:55] message
[46:56] came so God is good one more
[47:00] announcement let me make this before we
[47:02] before we receive the offering tonight
[47:04] and that is there will be a memorial
[47:07] service here at New Hope on Monday
[47:11] evening at 6: p.m and this is for the
[47:15] family and the friends and the loved
[47:17] ones of sister Royale and uh her sisters
[47:21] will be here and uh it will be a very
[47:23] special time we're doing it in the
[47:26] evening because Sister Williams thought
[47:28] about all those who work and wouldn't be
[47:30] able to come and uh where where uh her
[47:34] daughter's uh especially uh Joy now is
[47:37] living in Tennessee I don't know if you
[47:39] know this or not I'm sure brother gley
[47:41] does but they have all of their funerals
[47:44] all of their memorials at night in the
[47:47] evening so that people can come from
[47:49] work and then they normally do a burial
[47:51] the next day and you know for church
[47:53] folks that works pretty good so I was so
[47:57] glad when the news came now I know right
[48:00] now you're
[48:02] thinking you're thinking come Monday you
[48:05] ain't going to want to move but you
[48:07] going to
[48:08] move God's going to strengthen you to
[48:11] move and uh here's what I think I think
[48:14] we'll just be kind of extending camp
[48:16] meeting one
[48:17] night and we'll just come and celebrate
[48:20] no one loved the presence of the Lord
[48:25] that more than royal jelly sister royel
[48:28] and it will be a great honor to come
[48:30] here and let her family know how much
[48:33] she has meant to us I've been her pastor
[48:37] they've lived here for 31 years I've
[48:39] been her pastor about 32 years I'd say
[48:42] that's a long time I'm so thankful that
[48:46] God has released her from the
[48:50] pain she's in a new body reminds me of
[48:54] that reminds me of that old song said I

[1:06:50] a little later on you're going to find
[1:06:52] that I'm going to be talking about
[1:06:53] something that doesn't even seem to be
[1:06:55] seasoned
[1:06:56] for but I couldn't get away from it so
[1:07:00] here we are verse 6 Isaiah chapter
[1:07:04] 55 seek ye the Lord while he may be
[1:07:08] found call ye upon him while he is
[1:07:12] near let the wicked forsake his way and
[1:07:16] the unrighteous man his thoughts and let
[1:07:19] him return unto the Lord and He will
[1:07:22] have mercy upon him him and to our God
[1:07:26] for he will abundantly pardon for my
[1:07:30] thoughts are not your thoughts neither
[1:07:32] are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord
[1:07:36] for as the heavens are higher than the
[1:07:39] earth so are my ways higher than your
[1:07:41] ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
[1:07:46] for as the rain cometh down and the snow
[1:07:48] from heaven and returneth not thither
[1:07:51] but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring
[1:07:53] forth in Bud that it may give seed to
[1:07:56] the S and bread to the eater so shall my
[1:08:00] word be that goeth forth out of my mouth
[1:08:03] it shall not return unto me void but it
[1:08:07] shall accomplish that which I please and
[1:08:10] it shall prosper in the thing whet I
[1:08:14] sent it for you shall go out with joy
[1:08:17] and be led forth with peace the
[1:08:20] mountains and the hills shall Break
[1:08:22] Forth before you into singing and all
[1:08:25] the trees of the field shall clap their
[1:08:27] hands instead of the thorn shall come up
[1:08:30] the fur tree and instead of the Brier
[1:08:32] shall come up the Myrtle tree and it
[1:08:34] shall be to the Lord for a name for an
[1:08:38] everlasting sign that shall not be cut
[1:08:41] off before you're seated let's pray once
[1:08:43] again yes sir Our Father what a
[1:08:46] privilege it is to be gathered together
[1:08:50] with the saints of God and I Want to
[1:08:52] Thank You Lord that they come in with
[1:08:55] praise we just come in to glorify you
[1:08:58] for you're worthy to be praised and Lord
[1:09:01] we have expectation in this holy
[1:09:04] convocation that you have set aside for
[1:09:07] us and we've come Lord to hear from
[1:09:10] heaven we want to hear what you have to
[1:09:13] say so we're asking Lord that you'll
[1:09:15] just hide the vessel and that you will
[1:09:18] fill my mouth with your word Lord that
[1:09:21] it will come out with power and demonst
[1:09:23] ation words of Deliverance Lord even as
[1:09:27] the word is preached that it would be
[1:09:30] words of Deliverance for your people
[1:09:33] Lord I pray that even though I may have
[1:09:37] some notes that you will come and do
[1:09:40] what you want to in the house tonight
[1:09:42] and may you get glory and honor for it
[1:09:45] is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:47] we
[1:09:48] pray amen amen you may have your seats
[1:09:53] tonight tonight praise
[1:09:57] God we read through a scripture like
[1:09:59] this and we see where that the Lord
[1:10:02] speaks to us that that uh he says my
[1:10:06] thoughts are not your thoughts and your
[1:10:07] ways are not my ways and and he tells us
[1:10:11] that as the heaven is higher than the
[1:10:13] earth my ways are higher than your ways
[1:10:15] and my thoughts are higher than your
[1:10:18] thoughts and in and in time past
[1:10:22] probably we have pre preached a message
[1:10:24] on this and drove home uh the the the
[1:10:27] thought that we'll never get any higher
[1:10:30] than we are but that we don't want to
[1:10:32] think on that kind of a level because
[1:10:35] even though his ways are higher than our
[1:10:38] ways and his thoughts are higher than
[1:10:40] our thoughts we know that he has
[1:10:43] promised us in the end time that we have
[1:10:46] the mind of Christ we don't have to uh
[1:10:49] remain bowed down and say we're never
[1:10:51] going to go any higher because because
[1:10:53] he is beckoning us to come up higher he
[1:10:57] doesn't want us to remain in the place
[1:11:00] where we are and then he wants us to be
[1:11:04] so saturated with himself that we go
[1:11:08] higher and higher and higher he didn't
[1:11:11] tell us this so that we would sit down
[1:11:13] and quit he told us this because inside
[1:11:17] of us he planted something that desired
[1:11:20] more of him and because we desire more
[1:11:24] of him we are constantly looking for his
[1:11:27] ways and we are constantly reaching
[1:11:30] after his thoughts because we know that
[1:11:33] our thoughts are on a low plane and we
[1:11:35] don't want to remain on a low plane we
[1:11:38] desire to get on a higher plane than we
[1:11:41] are right now and then he comes on and
[1:11:44] he says that as the rain and the snow
[1:11:46] come down from heaven it brings forth
[1:11:49] water so that the seed that is in the
[1:11:52] ground would bring forth enough seed
[1:11:55] that it would give to the sers so he
[1:11:58] could plant another crop and not only
[1:12:01] enough seed to plant another crop but so
[1:12:04] that there would be enough to sustain
[1:12:06] him with the bread that he would need
[1:12:08] through the coming year through the
[1:12:10] winter months through the time when
[1:12:12] there would be no harvest the Harvest
[1:12:15] would be done and passed and so then
[1:12:17] there wouldn't be necessity to have
[1:12:19] grain to be able to grind to have bread
[1:12:22] to be able to uh be able to eat but we
[1:12:25] always want to have the seed for the
[1:12:28] next crop because we don't want to be
[1:12:31] left when we get time to plant that
[1:12:33] there's nothing to
[1:12:35] plant if a farmer were to plant a crop
[1:12:39] and he put one seed in the ground and up
[1:12:42] out of the earth came a plant and all
[1:12:45] that that seed produced was one more
[1:12:48] seed what would be the use of
[1:12:52] planting
[1:12:54] what a waste of time
[1:12:56] right but God has a a way by planting
[1:13:01] one seed that when a plant comes up
[1:13:04] there is a
[1:13:05] multiplication of that seed and out of
[1:13:09] that seed it brings forth a a multiplied
[1:13:13] number so that there's enough to keep
[1:13:15] for next planting and there's enough to
[1:13:18] make bread throughout the year and then
[1:13:22] he goes on to say this scripture that
[1:13:24] brother Shelly preached from not so very
[1:13:26] long ago so shall my word be that goeth
[1:13:30] forth out of my mouth let me pause here
[1:13:34] the word that comes out of God's mouth
[1:13:37] is not a single word that's going to
[1:13:39] come back a single
[1:13:42] word when the word goes out of God's
[1:13:45] mouth there is going to be a
[1:13:46] multiplication of that word there's
[1:13:49] going to be a a bigger number than it
[1:13:52] was when it went out of his mouth so
[1:13:54] shall my word be there's going to be a a
[1:13:59] planting of a seed and there's going to
[1:14:01] be a watering of the seed and when that
[1:14:04] seed comes up out of the ground it's
[1:14:07] going to be that there is going to be a
[1:14:11] multiplication so shall my word be that
[1:14:14] goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not
[1:14:18] return unto me void but it shall
[1:14:22] accomplish
[1:14:23] that which I please and it shall prosper
[1:14:27] in the thing whereto I send it yes sir
[1:14:32] if you read verse 11 in the Amplified it
[1:14:35] reads this way so shall my word be that
[1:14:39] goes forth out of my mouth it shall not
[1:14:42] return to me void without producing any
[1:14:48] effect
[1:14:50] useless but it shall accomplish that
[1:14:52] which I please and purpose and it shall
[1:14:55] prosper in the thing for which I sent it
[1:14:58] sir so when God speaks a word his words
[1:15:03] are not useless
[1:15:06] words we have been known to spout out
[1:15:11] some useless
[1:15:13] words and I believe it was the prophet
[1:15:16] Samuel the Bible says that none of the
[1:15:19] words which he spake fell to the
[1:15:22] ground I regret to inform you that many
[1:15:25] of my words have fallen to the
[1:15:28] ground and some of them
[1:15:31] produced rotten
[1:15:35] [Music]
[1:15:37] fruit by the grace of God because of the
[1:15:40] blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:15:43] Christ I do not have to face that again
[1:15:47] if I have
[1:15:48] repented of those things which I have
[1:15:50] spouted out and so as time time goes
[1:15:53] along and God really reveals himself to
[1:15:57] us and he reveals has been revealing to
[1:15:59] us the importance of the words that come
[1:16:03] out of our mouth that we want the words
[1:16:05] that come out of our mouth to be as the
[1:16:08] words of the Lord Jesus Christ that when
[1:16:11] they come out they don't come out to be
[1:16:14] useless words they come out to be to
[1:16:18] create something to bring forth a seed
[1:16:22] of destiny that will go into the ground
[1:16:26] and come uh come up out of the ground
[1:16:28] and will bear fruit uh that will be
[1:16:32] useful and beneficial to the body of
[1:16:35] Christ we want our words when we speak
[1:16:39] them that they would bring strength and
[1:16:42] encouragement to one another that they
[1:16:44] would bring help to our brother to our
[1:16:47] sister we don't want to be found
[1:16:49] speaking words of foolish jesting that
[1:16:53] all that all the time we're just
[1:16:55] speaking things that are nonsense we
[1:16:58] want to speak life into one
[1:17:01] another life God gave us the ability to
[1:17:06] speak life and we want to speak life to
[1:17:10] one another yes amen so the words that
[1:17:14] uh God speaks will not be void they
[1:17:19] won't be without producing an effect
[1:17:21] they won't be useless now we know that
[1:17:25] again we're we're stepping on some of
[1:17:27] the territory that brother shelle
[1:17:29] preached on a few weeks or so ago just
[1:17:32] at least you know I was paying
[1:17:36] attention Genesis 1:2 it says the Earth
[1:17:40] was without form and void Darkness was
[1:17:43] upon the face of the deep the spirit of
[1:17:47] God was moving he uh he moved upon the
[1:17:51] face of the waters Genesis 1 two so the
[1:17:55] this this here's this word void that we
[1:17:58] have uh the word of God is not going to
[1:18:01] return void but we see this word void
[1:18:04] and in this case it means an empty waste
[1:18:07] we know that that is not the way God
[1:18:10] creates he creates with purpose the
[1:18:14] words that come out of his mouth are
[1:18:16] going to create something that is going
[1:18:18] to be of use it's going to be of effect
[1:18:21] to help those that it it touches but
[1:18:25] here it says the Earth was without form
[1:18:27] and void it was an empty waste and so
[1:18:32] the the spirit of God was brooding and
[1:18:35] hovering over the face of the
[1:18:38] deep all of the
[1:18:40] seed was underneath of the
[1:18:46] water mud muck
[1:18:50] water Darkness
[1:18:54] right but yet as an
[1:18:57] eagle I chose to use an eagle rather
[1:19:00] than a
[1:19:01] chicken as an eagle would sit on her
[1:19:06] eggs and brood over her eggs bringing
[1:19:09] warmth or atmosphere to those
[1:19:13] eggs while those little
[1:19:17] chickies were growing those little
[1:19:19] eaglets were growing inside of that egg
[1:19:22] until it was time for them to come out
[1:19:24] of the egg Till There Was time for the
[1:19:26] egg to hatch the seed had already been
[1:19:30] put in place and there was had to be an
[1:19:33] atmosphere the seed had already been
[1:19:36] spoken into existence and brother
[1:19:39] brandham told us in the for seal that
[1:19:42] perhaps there was another another
[1:19:44] civilization that was there and that
[1:19:46] seed was already in the earth and so uh
[1:19:51] this God will whatever the chaotic
[1:19:55] happening that took place there there is
[1:19:58] now all of this seed that is in the
[1:20:01] earth that God is brooding over under
[1:20:04] the under the water in the darkness but
[1:20:07] God is protecting that
[1:20:10] seed because the seed that was under
[1:20:13] that water was not junk
[1:20:17] seed as brother Shel has been telling us
[1:20:20] that was certified seed because it came
[1:20:23] from the mouth of God and so as God is
[1:20:27] brooding over this seed and we see in
[1:20:30] the Book of Genesis that day one he said
[1:20:32] let there be
[1:20:33] light and there was light and then day
[1:20:37] two there was a dividing of the water
[1:20:40] below from the water above the firmament
[1:20:43] the heavens and then God is in a process
[1:20:46] of bringing this seed forth and so
[1:20:49] there's some things that had to be moved
[1:20:51] there are some things that had to be
[1:20:53] shifted it did not happen all in one
[1:20:58] day just think about how long brother
[1:21:02] brandham had an argument with people
[1:21:04] that wanted to they wanted to argue that
[1:21:06] the Earth was only six days or it only
[1:21:09] took six days and that's all the older
[1:21:12] you know were 6,000 years but he seemed
[1:21:14] to think that it could be millions or
[1:21:16] even billions of years old God doesn't
[1:21:19] operate on
[1:21:21] time right I don't think we should in
[1:21:24] camp meeting
[1:21:25] either except for to get here on
[1:21:30] time millions and billions of years
[1:21:33] perhaps I don't know how long that God
[1:21:36] was brooding over this seed protecting
[1:21:39] this seed while it was under the water
[1:21:41] but there came a time where God says
[1:21:44] it's time to bring forth of the seed and
[1:21:48] the first thing he did was he spoke
[1:21:50] light into this existence because it was
[1:21:53] necessary for the light to already be in
[1:21:57] place for that seed to begin to come
[1:21:59] forth and then he divided the waters the
[1:22:02] waters below the waters above the
[1:22:04] firmament and then on day three he the
[1:22:08] let the dry land appear yes Earth and
[1:22:12] let the Earth bring forth from the seed
[1:22:15] that was already in it and so that seed
[1:22:20] began to come forth that's right because
[1:22:22] it was good seed it was seed that had
[1:22:24] been planted there from time past we
[1:22:27] read in Luke 11 verse yeah Luke 8 verse
[1:22:33] 11 now the parable is this the seed is
[1:22:38] the word of God
[1:22:41] now the seed that was underneath all of
[1:22:45] that muck was the word of
[1:22:49] God and it had to come forth
[1:22:54] it was not going to return to him as
[1:23:00] nothingness if you would have had the
[1:23:03] ability to watch what was going on at
[1:23:07] that
[1:23:10] moment you would have thought it's all
[1:23:13] over
[1:23:15] right right this will never produce
[1:23:18] anything
[1:23:21] again
[1:23:24] chaos nothing
[1:23:27] Blackness
[1:23:28] Darkness mud water this seed can never
[1:23:33] bring forth
[1:23:35] yet God was watching over that seed
[1:23:40] because he was going to bring it to pass
[1:23:43] now we read in Hebrews chap 4:2 in the
[1:23:47] Amplified the word of God that speaks is
[1:23:49] alive and full of power making it active
[1:23:55] operative
[1:23:56] energizing and
[1:23:59] effective I you you can read the rest of
[1:24:02] the verse later but I I just want you to
[1:24:05] catch those words that the Amplified
[1:24:08] gives us full of power making it
[1:24:11] active
[1:24:13] operative
[1:24:15] energizing and effective amen a word
[1:24:19] from God is never going to come back to
[1:24:23] him
[1:24:24] useless or
[1:24:29] ineffective
[1:24:33] never and because that I am a word from
[1:24:38] God I am not going to return to him
[1:24:43] useless and
[1:24:45] ineffective you as a word from God are
[1:24:49] not going to return to him as useless
[1:24:52] and ineffective now tonight you may be
[1:24:55] sitting here and feeling like as maybe
[1:24:59] the enemy has been at you all day and
[1:25:02] you feel
[1:25:04] useless and you feel
[1:25:07] ineffective I'm stressing that word
[1:25:11] feel because there are many times that
[1:25:14] the enemy makes us feel a certain
[1:25:18] way but it does not take away from the
[1:25:21] fact
[1:25:22] that I am a word sent from God and that
[1:25:26] I will not go back to him useless or
[1:25:31] ineffective and so when he comes to me
[1:25:35] to try to remind me or tell me that I am
[1:25:38] useless and ineffective I have the
[1:25:41] opportunity to remind him that I have a
[1:25:45] revelation that I am a word sent from
[1:25:48] God and that no matter what it looks
[1:25:50] like or feels like today it doesn't
[1:25:52] change what God's word said about me
[1:25:55] that I am still a useful vessel for the
[1:25:59] kingdom of
[1:26:00] God we have these ups and downs and then
[1:26:04] when we when we feel down the enemy
[1:26:06] wants to come at us and he wants to
[1:26:08] Badger us he wants to hit us he wants to
[1:26:11] kick us he wants to stomp us he wants to
[1:26:13] punch us but that is just what he is and
[1:26:16] it is what he does but I want to remind
[1:26:19] him tonight that heaven and earth may
[1:26:22] pass away but the word of God shall
[1:26:25] never pass away I am Eternal I am an
[1:26:29] eternal being I have stepped into the
[1:26:31] realm of time for a period of time but
[1:26:35] that is just a very short time because I
[1:26:38] am an eternal being from the mouth of
[1:26:41] the Eternal God and I am going to return
[1:26:43] to that Eternal God into a theop body
[1:26:47] for a period of time and then I'm told
[1:26:49] that I'm going to pick up a glorified
[1:26:51] body
[1:26:54] so as a human I'm tested I'm tried uh
[1:26:57] the the enemy batters me and he comes
[1:26:59] and he tries to test me but all of this
[1:27:02] is just God's way of putting me here to
[1:27:05] test
[1:27:07] me The Temptations come that's right
[1:27:11] just think for a moment what it feels
[1:27:13] like for a seed
[1:27:15] uhuh a kernel of seed whatever that seed
[1:27:19] may
[1:27:20] be and that seed may have come out of a
[1:27:24] package it may be been saved from
[1:27:26] another crop it may have been sitting to
[1:27:30] where that it could at least get some
[1:27:32] glimpse of light but it was kind of
[1:27:34] feeling you know that seed was
[1:27:36] dry but after a while it came time to
[1:27:39] plant that seed and if that seed could
[1:27:42] have feelings when somebody comes along
[1:27:45] with a hoe and Raks a ditch in the
[1:27:47] ground and plants that seed in the
[1:27:50] ground and then comes along and puts
[1:27:52] dirt back over top of that seed if that
[1:27:55] seed could have feelings it may start
[1:27:57] shouting wait a minute I don't want to
[1:27:59] be in this place this dark
[1:28:04] place and then whoever planted that seed
[1:28:08] had the essity after they covered it up
[1:28:11] with dirt to come along with a water and
[1:28:14] can and make
[1:28:17] mud what is that seed feeling like and
[1:28:21] you say this this this just seems so so
[1:28:24] crazy to even think about but I am a I
[1:28:27] was a
[1:28:28] seed I was a
[1:28:30] seed and there was a time that I was in
[1:28:33] the dirt I was I was in
[1:28:35] darkness I was wondering which way I was
[1:28:39] ever supposed to go but I was a seed
[1:28:42] word from God all right but I had to be
[1:28:45] planted yes sir I had to come into the
[1:28:49] Earth and God chose the way for me to
[1:28:52] get here the form of a womb of a sinful
[1:28:57] [Music]
[1:29:00] woman and
[1:29:04] man by the sin
[1:29:07] nature and then on top of that after I
[1:29:11] was born I was born I came to this world
[1:29:15] and I didn't have to learn how to lie I
[1:29:18] didn't have to learn how to be a bad
[1:29:20] person it just was the nature of of of
[1:29:24] the human the human race and so then I
[1:29:28] had to find my way to God or he found me
[1:29:32] is really the truth of the matter uh
[1:29:36] it's sometimes we say we found God but
[1:29:39] it wasn't really me looking for him he
[1:29:42] was looking for me because I was one of
[1:29:45] those certified seed that came out of
[1:29:48] his mouth that was not going to return
[1:29:50] void to him
[1:29:52] I wasn't going to return to him useless
[1:29:54] and
[1:29:59] ineffective no matter what
[1:30:01] mud it looked like I was in no matter
[1:30:05] how deep under the ground it looked like
[1:30:07] I had been there was life in that seed
[1:30:12] and that seed was going to come to life
[1:30:15] and it was going to bust up and out of
[1:30:17] that dirt out of that Darkness because
[1:30:21] it was all the time reaching for the
[1:30:23] light because the light was reaching for
[1:30:29] it he didn't send me
[1:30:32] here for me to try to get back to him by
[1:30:35] my own
[1:30:36] intellect he did not send me
[1:30:39] here to try to get back to him by being
[1:30:44] good enough for
[1:30:46] him it was because that the seed that he
[1:30:50] put in the Earth
[1:30:52] was that certified seed and it was going
[1:30:57] to produce what he desired for it to
[1:31:01] produce so in the course of events of my
[1:31:06] life he knew that it was going to take a
[1:31:09] trial of my faith in order for me to
[1:31:14] become useful and effective because the
[1:31:19] human nature wants the intellect
[1:31:22] the human nature wants to do it their
[1:31:25] way the human nature wants to think that
[1:31:29] they have accomplish something and did
[1:31:31] it by their own smarts but God wanted us
[1:31:35] to know you can be a smart person you
[1:31:38] can be a beautiful person you can be uh
[1:31:42] somebody that is born into a wealthy
[1:31:44] family but
[1:31:47] yet none of that will get you back to
[1:31:51] God
[1:31:53] it has to take the new
[1:31:56] birth and then after the New Birth is
[1:32:00] the trial of your faith 1 Peter 1:7 in
[1:32:04] the Amplified so that the genuiness of
[1:32:07] your faith may be
[1:32:10] tested your faith which is infinitely
[1:32:13] more precious than the perishable gold
[1:32:16] which is tested and purified by fire
[1:32:21] this this proving of your faith is
[1:32:24] intent intended to redound to your
[1:32:28] praise and glory and honor when Jesus
[1:32:31] Christ the Messiah the anointed one is
[1:32:34] revealed now I wasn't smart enough to
[1:32:37] know what the word redown meant so I
[1:32:40] looked that up and it means to
[1:32:41] contribute
[1:32:43] greatly this proving of your faith is
[1:32:46] intended to contribute greatly to your
[1:32:50] praise and glory G and honor when Jesus
[1:32:54] Christ the Messiah the anointed one is
[1:32:57] revealed so all of this that you're
[1:33:00] going through the trial of your faith
[1:33:03] the proving of your faith it is intended
[1:33:06] so that when you are finished with this
[1:33:10] journey it is going to be that you have
[1:33:13] a great contribution to your praise and
[1:33:17] glory and honor when he is revealed in
[1:33:20] his fullness
[1:33:24] now in Reading I have come to understand
[1:33:28] that
[1:33:29] gold does not exist in its purest form
[1:33:38] naturally The Ore is extracted from the
[1:33:41] earth and in that ore there are
[1:33:48] contaminant and there are different ways
[1:33:51] to to get the contaminants out of the
[1:33:53] gold that's right
[1:33:56] uh and it is the way that they get it
[1:34:01] till that it gets to the highest level
[1:34:04] in my understanding 24 Karat being the
[1:34:07] purest of
[1:34:09] gold so in this mining process being
[1:34:12] mixed with
[1:34:13] impurities one of the ways that they
[1:34:16] refine this gold is
[1:34:19] to apply heat
[1:34:27] 1,948 de
[1:34:33] Fahrenheit Mighty hot I
[1:34:39] might and I heard a minister a few weeks
[1:34:42] ago talking about gold and talking about
[1:34:46] the refining process something that
[1:34:48] struck
[1:34:49] me he said you know
[1:34:53] the
[1:34:54] gold is not crying out stop the
[1:34:59] heat it's the
[1:35:01] impurities that are screaming stop the
[1:35:07] heat the gold says Crank It Up get all
[1:35:11] the impurities
[1:35:13] out the impurities are screaming whoa
[1:35:16] that's enough for right now take it's
[1:35:19] too hot
[1:35:22] and when we get in the middle of the
[1:35:25] trial we the human part of us we can
[1:35:30] hardly stand the heat of this refining
[1:35:33] process but yet there's something deep
[1:35:35] down on the inside that's crying turn it
[1:35:39] up get it as hot as it needs to be I'm
[1:35:42] tired of this refining process let's get
[1:35:45] to the Purity hallelujah
[1:35:50] hallelujah
[1:35:56] I'd like to tell you that I'm not full
[1:35:59] of
[1:36:01] impurities I'm not I am not full of
[1:36:06] impurities I've been walking with the
[1:36:08] Lord now for some years and there's some
[1:36:10] of them that have been refined out of me
[1:36:13] by the grace of God and I believe it's
[1:36:15] that way for you as well and if it's not
[1:36:19] I would like to tell you your turn's
[1:36:22] coming but I am not trying to throw
[1:36:25] anything at you that I would sit and
[1:36:28] gloat while you go through what you've
[1:36:29] got to go through to get rid of it
[1:36:32] because the reving process is not a
[1:36:34] pretty process when when it comes to
[1:36:37] humanity but it is a necessary process
[1:36:40] for us to get the impurities out of it
[1:36:43] because God is going to have me his word
[1:36:47] come back to him as useful and effective
[1:36:56] Jesus Jeremiah chapter
[1:37:01] 1 verse four the word of the Lord came
[1:37:03] to me the word of the Lord came to me
[1:37:06] saying this is Jeremiah before I formed
[1:37:10] thee in the belly I knew thee and before
[1:37:14] you came forth out of the womb I
[1:37:15] Sanctified thee and ordained thee a
[1:37:17] prophet to the
[1:37:20] Nations
[1:37:22] then I said a lord God behold I cannot
[1:37:24] speak for I am a
[1:37:26] child but the Lord said to me say not
[1:37:29] I'm a
[1:37:31] child for Thou shalt go to all that I
[1:37:35] shall send you and whatsoever I command
[1:37:38] thee Thou shalt speak be not afraid of
[1:37:41] their faces for I am with thee to
[1:37:43] deliver thee saith the
[1:37:46] Lord then the Lord put his put forth his
[1:37:49] hand and touched my mouth and the Lord
[1:37:52] said unto me behold I have put my words
[1:37:56] in your
[1:37:58] mouth
[1:37:59] see I have this day set thee over the
[1:38:03] Nations and over the kingdoms to root
[1:38:07] out to pull down to destroy to throw
[1:38:12] down to
[1:38:14] build and to plant now God gave Jeremiah
[1:38:19] quite the task
[1:38:22] he told him before you ever got
[1:38:25] here I knew
[1:38:29] you and Amplified says I approved you as
[1:38:33] my chosen servant before you ever got
[1:38:41] here by his forn knowledge he knew your
[1:38:45] choice and he could give you a prefixed
[1:38:48] Destiny before you ever came out out of
[1:38:51] the womb God knew you and he had already
[1:38:54] approved
[1:38:55] you he did not wait till the night you
[1:38:58] called on him to approve
[1:39:00] you if he ever approved you he did it
[1:39:03] way before you got
[1:39:07] here and he said Jeremiah I have put my
[1:39:10] word in your mouth now when God puts his
[1:39:13] word in your
[1:39:15] mouth then your
[1:39:18] word is now his word
[1:39:22] cuz he put it
[1:39:25] there and because he put it
[1:39:28] there and chose you to speak it then it
[1:39:32] won't return useless and
[1:39:36] ineffective it is going to accomplish
[1:39:39] what it was sent to
[1:39:41] do so then he tells him the words that
[1:39:46] I've put in your mouth are going to
[1:39:47] accomplish some things they're going to
[1:39:49] root out and they're going to pull down
[1:39:51] and they're going to destroy and they're
[1:39:53] going to overthrow now this looks bad
[1:39:55] you got to remember that when Jeremiah
[1:39:57] was prophesying this was toward the end
[1:40:01] of Israel's Kingdom when they were going
[1:40:03] to go into Babylonian captivity and they
[1:40:05] were going to be you know uh was it
[1:40:10] zedekiah there was another man that was
[1:40:12] prophesying differently than is that
[1:40:16] right that was prophesying differently
[1:40:18] than Jeremiah and he said to years Years
[1:40:21] and we're going to be back whereas
[1:40:23] Jeremiah was saying the word of the Lord
[1:40:25] is 70 years we're going to be in
[1:40:27] captivity and Jeremiah he when he hears
[1:40:31] this man saying it's only going to be
[1:40:32] two years he said okay Amen Let It Be So
[1:40:36] let it let 70 years be wrong you know
[1:40:40] two years I'll go with that but the word
[1:40:42] of the Lord was in Jeremiah's mouth and
[1:40:46] he had to contend with some things and
[1:40:48] he had to deal with some false prophets
[1:40:50] and he had to deal with the people that
[1:40:53] were going Wayward and he saw this
[1:40:55] Kingdom in Decline and his heart is
[1:40:58] hurting for it and so God is telling him
[1:41:00] I'm calling you to say some things that
[1:41:03] are not going to be
[1:41:05] pretty but you don't worry about it
[1:41:08] don't even worry about what their faces
[1:41:09] look like you just go ahead and speak
[1:41:11] what I put in your mouth I am going to
[1:41:14] put my word in your mouth and there's
[1:41:17] going to be some rooting out and there's
[1:41:20] going to be some plucking down and
[1:41:21] pulling down and destroying and
[1:41:23] overthrowing but God didn't leave it in
[1:41:25] the state of disarray there was also
[1:41:28] going to be some word that was going to
[1:41:30] build back up and planting and there was
[1:41:32] going to be things that came out of
[1:41:34] Jeremiah's mouth that was going to
[1:41:36] prophetically declare in time to come
[1:41:40] I'm going to take you into captivity and
[1:41:42] you're going to be there for 70 years
[1:41:45] but after 70 years there's going to be a
[1:41:48] rebuilding and there's going to be a
[1:41:49] planting and I'm going to bring you back
[1:41:51] to the land I'm going to let the people
[1:41:53] come back to the land and so all of
[1:41:55] these things you know Jeremiah he feels
[1:41:57] like he's too young to be the mouthpiece
[1:42:00] for God to be able to speak these things
[1:42:02] and he's arguing with the Lord and the
[1:42:04] Lord says now you hush up don't you tell
[1:42:06] me you're too
[1:42:08] young I'm going to put my word in your
[1:42:10] mouth you just speak what I put
[1:42:13] there then the word of the Lord verse 11
[1:42:16] moreover the word of the Lord came unto
[1:42:17] me saying Jeremiah what seeth thou and I
[1:42:22] said I see a rod of an almond
[1:42:25] tree then said the Lord unto me thou
[1:42:29] Hast well seen for I will hasten my word
[1:42:34] to perform it now Jeremiah is now again
[1:42:40] spoken to by the Lord and the Lord asked
[1:42:43] Jeremiah this question what do you
[1:42:49] see
[1:42:56] Jeremiah immediately had a response or
[1:42:59] so it seems here that he had a response
[1:43:02] quickly he didn't have to second guess
[1:43:05] himself he spoke back to the Lord and he
[1:43:07] said I see the rod of an almond
[1:43:10] tree then the Lord said you've seen
[1:43:13] right you've seen well I will hasten my
[1:43:17] word to perform
[1:43:19] it now these words
[1:43:22] here are very interesting to
[1:43:25] me because the word
[1:43:28] almond is the Strong's word
[1:43:32] 8247
[1:43:36] shade and the word
[1:43:38] hasten is
[1:43:41] 8245
[1:43:45] shocked
[1:43:48] 8245 hasten means to watch or to
[1:43:53] wake
[1:43:56] 8246 which is not in this text here
[1:44:00] is
[1:44:03] the replica of an
[1:44:06] almond not the actual almond
[1:44:12] 8247 is the actual
[1:44:16] almond and what I'm seeing here is a
[1:44:20] play on these Hebrew words that you
[1:44:23] don't see in the English you don't see
[1:44:25] in the King James uh you see it a little
[1:44:28] better in the Amplified moreover the
[1:44:31] word of the Lord came to me saying
[1:44:32] Jeremiah what do you see and I said I
[1:44:36] see a branch or a chute of an almond
[1:44:39] tree the emblem of alertness and
[1:44:42] activity blossoming in late winter then
[1:44:47] said the Lord to me you have seen well
[1:44:51] for I am alert and active watching over
[1:44:56] my word to perform it how hard is it for
[1:45:00] you to bring back Hebrews 4:12 in the
[1:45:03] Amplified can you give me back Hebrews
[1:45:06] 4:12
[1:45:09] Amplified the word that God speaks is
[1:45:12] alive and full of power making it active
[1:45:15] operative energizing and effective here
[1:45:19] he says I am alert and active watching
[1:45:23] over my word to perform
[1:45:26] it
[1:45:28] now he has these play on these words
[1:45:32] here they're very close to one another
[1:45:35] and so then your mind begins to think
[1:45:37] almond what do you have that is almond
[1:45:41] what in the scripture is the Almond so
[1:45:43] then we go to Exodus chapter
[1:45:49] 25
[1:45:52] and this is one of those passages of
[1:45:56] scripture that we don't have a lot of
[1:45:59] understanding about and so in our
[1:46:02] younger
[1:46:04] years we kind of drifted over
[1:46:10] it verse 31 Thou shalt make a
[1:46:13] Candlestick of pure gold of beaten work
[1:46:16] shall the Candlestick be made his shaft
[1:46:20] his branches his bowls his knops and his
[1:46:24] flowers shall be of the
[1:46:26] same and six branches shall come out of
[1:46:28] the sides of it three branches of the
[1:46:30] Candlestick out of the side the one side
[1:46:33] and three branches of the Candlestick
[1:46:35] out of the other side three bowls made
[1:46:38] like un almonds with a knop and a flower
[1:46:42] in one branch three bowls made like
[1:46:44] almonds in the other Branch with a knop
[1:46:46] and a flower so in the six branches that
[1:46:50] come out out of the
[1:46:51] Candlestick and in the Candlestick shall
[1:46:53] be four bowls made like unto almonds
[1:46:56] with their knops and their
[1:46:58] flowers this is a lot of repetition of
[1:47:01] knops and bowls and
[1:47:03] flowers but I want to read all of it
[1:47:07] because probably most of us have skipped
[1:47:09] over
[1:47:12] it all right verse 34 in the Candlestick
[1:47:15] shall be four bowls made like almonds
[1:47:17] with their knops and their flowers and
[1:47:18] there shall be a knp under two branches
[1:47:21] of the same and a knp under two branches
[1:47:24] of the same and a knp under two branches
[1:47:26] of the same according to the six
[1:47:29] branches that prede out of the
[1:47:31] Candlestick now I want you to know that
[1:47:34] if bezel didn't have any more
[1:47:36] instruction than
[1:47:44] that thank God for the
[1:47:48] anointing getting in the spirit spirit
[1:47:51] with Moses Moses trying to give to him
[1:47:55] understanding of what he saw in another
[1:47:59] realm but bezel was the one that had to
[1:48:02] build it their knops and their branches
[1:48:05] shall be of the same it shall be of one
[1:48:07] beaten work of pure gold and thou shalt
[1:48:10] make the seven lamps thereof and they
[1:48:12] shall light the lamps thereof that they
[1:48:15] may give light over against it and the
[1:48:17] tongs thereof and the snuff dishes
[1:48:19] thereof shall be of pure gold of a Talon
[1:48:21] of pure gold shall he make it with all
[1:48:24] these vessels and look that thou make
[1:48:28] them after their pattern which was
[1:48:31] showed thee in the
[1:48:35] mountain so
[1:48:37] now in this seven Branch
[1:48:41] Candlestick God
[1:48:44] chose to
[1:48:47] incorporate this
[1:48:49] almond
[1:48:51] in the branches of this seven branched
[1:48:56] Candlestick God has incorporated the
[1:48:59] knop
[1:49:01] which in in looking at the definition
[1:49:05] some of the definitions they say a knob
[1:49:07] well that doesn't really tell you
[1:49:09] anything but what it appears that it is
[1:49:12] it's like the the encircling of of the
[1:49:18] flower and you can look online and see
[1:49:22] pictures of the manora that is is ready
[1:49:25] that they have there on display in
[1:49:27] Jerusalem but you have the Almond uh the
[1:49:31] bowl made like almond these seven bowls
[1:49:34] that are made like almonds and you begin
[1:49:36] to ponder God is using this word again
[1:49:41] shade to to speak here about this seven
[1:49:46] Branch Candlestick that is in the T
[1:49:50] Tabernacle that Moses saw when he was in
[1:49:54] the mount and he brought it back down
[1:49:56] and he spoke to bezel and he's trying to
[1:49:59] give him instructions and bezo is
[1:50:01] getting under the anointing he's getting
[1:50:03] in the spirit and he's going to build we
[1:50:05] read later on in Exodus that indeed he
[1:50:08] built it and he built it according to
[1:50:11] the instruction and it had these balls
[1:50:13] like under almonds and so you have this
[1:50:16] play on words again where God has built
[1:50:20] into this seven Branch Candlestick this
[1:50:23] thought of the Almond where he says
[1:50:25] there's alertness and
[1:50:30] watchfulness and in this alertness and
[1:50:34] watchfulness these these bowls that are
[1:50:37] shaped like almonds are holding the oil
[1:50:40] whereof the priests are going to light
[1:50:42] and and keep it burning the fire inside
[1:50:45] of the Holy place and so God is again
[1:50:50] representing himself that he is watching
[1:50:53] over his word to perform
[1:50:56] it because just a little ways away from
[1:51:00] that behind that curtain is where the
[1:51:04] high priest can only go one time a year
[1:51:06] for the sins of the people is the holy
[1:51:09] of holies where is The Mercy Seat and
[1:51:12] inside of that Mercy Seat there's some
[1:51:14] of the Mana and there is there is the
[1:51:17] showbread there and there is also
[1:51:23] Aaron's
[1:51:27] Rod God told them to put that Rod there
[1:51:32] now what's so special about Aaron's Rod
[1:51:36] well there had been a rebellion among
[1:51:38] the people and Kora he thought he he
[1:51:42] thought he was going to come and take
[1:51:44] over Moses's position and and then uh
[1:51:48] there were others there that wanted to
[1:51:50] usurp Authority they thought that Moses
[1:51:52] had taken too much upon himself and God
[1:51:56] said you separate from those people he
[1:51:58] told Moses you separate from those
[1:52:00] people and if I don't do something
[1:52:03] completely different than is normal for
[1:52:06] this Earth then then you won't have to
[1:52:09] say that I have have done this but if
[1:52:11] the Earth opens up and swallows them you
[1:52:14] will know that I have showed up and so
[1:52:17] indeed the Earth it opens up and it
[1:52:20] swallows Kora and his sons and down into
[1:52:23] the Earth all their stuff went down into
[1:52:25] the Earth God just swallowed them up but
[1:52:28] do you think that stopped the murmuring
[1:52:30] of the people
[1:52:37] no and the people come to Moses again
[1:52:40] and say Moses you take too much on
[1:52:44] yourself take too much on
[1:52:47] yourself and God said just
[1:52:50] get out of the way I'll take care of
[1:52:53] them and there was a plague that went
[1:52:56] through the
[1:52:57] camp and
[1:53:00] Moses once again became intercession for
[1:53:03] the
[1:53:05] people but before it was over there were
[1:53:08] over 14,000 people that were dead in
[1:53:11] that instance besides the ones that had
[1:53:14] died
[1:53:15] before the plague was
[1:53:18] stopped but after that God invited each
[1:53:22] head of the tribe to come to the door of
[1:53:25] the tent of meeting and he says I want
[1:53:28] every one of you to bring a rod and I
[1:53:31] want you to inscribe your name in that
[1:53:33] rod and I am going to once and for all I
[1:53:38] am going to differentiate between who I
[1:53:42] have called and who man is
[1:53:45] called I'm going to demonstrate
[1:53:47] something to you so so they were
[1:53:51] instructed to bring the rods the staff
[1:53:54] and they were to take and put them into
[1:53:56] the holy of holies and they were to
[1:53:58] leave them there overnight well when
[1:54:01] they came back to retrieve those rods
[1:54:04] there was 11 rods that look just the way
[1:54:07] they did when they put them there but
[1:54:10] there was one rod that God got
[1:54:15] in and when God got in that rod
[1:54:20] the Bible tells us that not only did it
[1:54:23] have buds but it had
[1:54:26] blooms not only did it have Buds and
[1:54:29] blooms but it also brought forth ripe
[1:54:34] almonds here we are with the Almond
[1:54:36] again God watching over his word to
[1:54:40] perform it I am going to do what I said
[1:54:44] I would do I called Aaron to be the high
[1:54:48] priest I called that lineage I called
[1:54:51] his family I called Moses and I have
[1:54:54] this seven Branch Candlestick with this
[1:54:57] demonstration of the Almond W with with
[1:55:00] this almond look alike here this dish on
[1:55:04] top that produces light but I'm going to
[1:55:07] shed more light than just the seven
[1:55:09] Branch Candlestick when it gets in the
[1:55:11] presence of the Shea it's going to bring
[1:55:14] forth what I instituted for it to bring
[1:55:17] forth to start with Hallelujah
[1:55:25] now I've never been privileged to be in
[1:55:28] Israel when the almond trees
[1:55:31] bloom but I am told that it is more
[1:55:34] beautiful than Washington DC when the
[1:55:37] cherry trees
[1:55:39] bloom the thing about when you read
[1:55:42] about the
[1:55:43] Almond what you find is that it is the
[1:55:48] first blooming
[1:55:51] tree it's the first one to
[1:55:55] bloom seemingly while it is still winter
[1:55:59] it
[1:56:02] blooms the first one to
[1:56:05] bloom but the interesting thing is it's
[1:56:08] last to
[1:56:13] harvest first to
[1:56:16] bloom last to harvest
[1:56:21] we get in a
[1:56:24] hurry because we want it
[1:56:29] now when a word comes forth to us we
[1:56:32] want it
[1:56:36] now sometimes we feel like we need it
[1:56:39] right
[1:56:40] now I need this word to be fulfilled
[1:56:43] right now I don't need it in 30 years I
[1:56:45] need it
[1:56:48] now but my my
[1:56:50] papa who is watching over his word to
[1:56:53] perform it knows
[1:56:57] best now we have demonstrated in the
[1:57:03] scripture what God showed to Jeremiah in
[1:57:07] this Rod this he said I see an almond
[1:57:12] tree to the Natural
[1:57:15] Eye all that the rod that air carried
[1:57:20] around was just another
[1:57:24] stick cut off from its Life
[1:57:27] Source something to keep Aaron steady on
[1:57:32] his
[1:57:33] feet now there was a lot more to that
[1:57:35] Rod than just keeping Aaron steady on
[1:57:37] his feet this was a rod that God used
[1:57:40] multiple times but it still looked like
[1:57:42] a dead dry
[1:57:44] stick until it got in the
[1:57:48] presence the
[1:57:50] shenar now you have this seven Branch
[1:57:54] Candlestick on the
[1:57:56] outside with the semblance of
[1:58:00] almonds in the
[1:58:04] bowls and then you have the curtain
[1:58:08] dividing the holy of
[1:58:11] holies I
[1:58:13] oh God doesn't do
[1:58:18] things just to dangle before our eyes
[1:58:22] and say this is what I did
[1:58:28] yesterday and so I began to think about
[1:58:30] this and I
[1:58:34] remembered that there was a time that
[1:58:37] John was caught up in the spirit on the
[1:58:40] Lord's
[1:58:41] Day Revelation chap 1:10 I was in the
[1:58:45] spirit on the Lord's day and I heard
[1:58:47] behind me a great voice as a trumpet
[1:58:50] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[1:58:54] and the last and what thou seest right
[1:58:57] in a book incend it under the seven
[1:58:59] churches which are in Asia under Ephesus
[1:59:01] and Smyrna under pergamus and under
[1:59:04] thyra and unto Sardis and unto
[1:59:07] Philadelphia and unto lead deia and I
[1:59:10] turned to see the voice that spake with
[1:59:14] me and I being turned I saw seven golden
[1:59:23] candlesticks now
[1:59:25] if Moses was caught up and he was
[1:59:31] instructed to come back to the Earth and
[1:59:34] build what he saw when he was on the
[1:59:37] mountain I believe that he was caught up
[1:59:40] into Heavenly places and he saw what
[1:59:43] John was seeing and he brought it back
[1:59:46] down to the Earth so somewhere in this
[1:59:49] seven golden candlesticks I believe that
[1:59:52] there is a semblance of an almond
[1:59:55] somewhere so now he says I turned and I
[1:59:59] saw seven golden candlesticks and in the
[2:00:02] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[2:00:04] one like un the son of man clothed with
[2:00:07] a garment down to the foot and gird
[2:00:09] about the paps with a golden
[2:00:11] girdle his head and his hairs were white
[2:00:16] like wool as white as snow
[2:00:19] and his eyes were as a flame of
[2:00:23] fire I will watch over my
[2:00:27] word to perform it I will watch over my
[2:00:32] word to perform it the eyes of the Lord
[2:00:35] going to and fro throughout the whole
[2:00:37] earth he's going to bring to fruition
[2:00:39] the word that came out of his mouth and
[2:00:42] he John is now seeing in this heavenly
[2:00:45] places he is seeing wandering through
[2:00:48] these seven gold are in the midst of the
[2:00:50] seven golden candlesticks the one like
[2:00:52] the son of man and he's talking about
[2:00:55] what he looks like but he says his eyes
[2:00:57] were like flames of fire and we have
[2:01:00] heard that this eyes of flames of fire
[2:01:03] was his love for his bride he's watching
[2:01:06] over his word to perform it his head and
[2:01:10] his hair is white like wool as white as
[2:01:12] snow his eyes flames of fire and his
[2:01:15] feet like undefined brass as if they
[2:01:18] burned in a furnace and his voice as the
[2:01:21] sound of many Waters and he had in his
[2:01:24] right hand Seven Stars and out of his
[2:01:26] mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and
[2:01:29] his countenance was as the sun shineth
[2:01:31] in his strength and when I saw him I
[2:01:34] fell at his feet as dead and he laid his
[2:01:37] right hand upon me saying unto me fear
[2:01:42] not I am the first and the last I am he
[2:01:46] that liveth and was dead and behold I'm
[2:01:49] alive forever more amen and have the
[2:01:53] keys of hell and of death glory god
[2:01:59] walking through the midst of the seven
[2:02:02] churches the demonstration that the eyes
[2:02:05] of the Lord are upon us the
[2:02:08] demonstration that the word that goes
[2:02:10] out of his mouth he is going to have his
[2:02:14] eyes on that and he is going to make
[2:02:17] sure that that word comes to its
[2:02:20] fullness that it comes to its full
[2:02:23] Effectiveness its full usefulness he is
[2:02:27] going to make sure that you do not
[2:02:30] linger too
[2:02:33] long outside of the holy of
[2:02:37] holies but he wants you to go in behind
[2:02:40] the holy of holies where that it's not
[2:02:43] just the representation in the bowl
[2:02:47] where there is light but there has come
[2:02:49] come light in the evening time to shed
[2:02:51] light upon the fact that you don't have
[2:02:54] to remain in the Holy place but you've
[2:02:56] been invited to come into the holy of
[2:02:59] holies behind the veil to shut out the
[2:03:03] world and to enter into the presence of
[2:03:05] God where that something happens where
[2:03:08] he can take an old Dead stick and it's
[2:03:11] no longer just the representation or the
[2:03:14] lookalike in an alond but it is the very
[2:03:17] life of Jesus Jesus Christ poured into
[2:03:21] the believer so that she becomes useful
[2:03:25] and she becomes effective in the earth
[2:03:28] and by the time that she gets to the end
[2:03:30] of her life she has found her place her
[2:03:35] position Hallelujah just as Aaron's
[2:03:40] Rod was no longer a dead dry
[2:03:45] stick but God in His Infinite
[2:03:50] Wisdom came with his presence and his
[2:03:53] power and breathed life back into that
[2:03:57] stick and that stick just didn't come
[2:03:59] forth just a little bit with just a bud
[2:04:03] it didn't stop in the middle part with a
[2:04:05] blossom but the Bible tells us that it
[2:04:08] came forth with ripe almonds it came
[2:04:10] forth with something of substance
[2:04:13] something that showed I have put my life
[2:04:17] in this and it has produce the fruit
[2:04:20] that it was designed to
[2:04:23] produce you are not a dead dry
[2:04:26] [Music]
[2:04:28] stick you are a word sent from God and I
[2:04:34] want you to know that even as God spoke
[2:04:37] to Jeremiah and said I have put my word
[2:04:40] in your mouth Jeremiah that God has also
[2:04:44] done that for his bride in the end time
[2:04:47] and he said I've put my word in your
[2:04:50] mouth and we had a prophet that came in
[2:04:53] our dead in our day and he told us that
[2:04:56] the word in the mouth of the Bride that
[2:04:59] she would have power to be able to
[2:05:01] create a world and go live on it she
[2:05:04] would have power to stop the heavens she
[2:05:07] would have power to call forth frogs she
[2:05:10] would have power to do this and do that
[2:05:13] because the word of God was in her
[2:05:17] mouth yet we have found ourselves
[2:05:21] saying where is
[2:05:24] this and God speaks
[2:05:29] back what do you
[2:05:33] see what do you
[2:05:36] see
[2:05:37] good what do you see good
[2:05:41] word what have you talked about about
[2:05:44] your own self just a dead dry stick I'm
[2:05:47] useless in in this church I'm useful
[2:05:50] useless in the Kingdom there's nothing
[2:05:52] for me to do nobody pays attention to
[2:05:55] me what do you see
[2:06:00] yeah or when the Lord asks you what do
[2:06:04] you
[2:06:05] see you respond
[2:06:08] with I see that I am a word sent from
[2:06:14] God and that because you chose to
[2:06:18] demonst rate that word through a human
[2:06:21] vessel I could not be let loose with all
[2:06:25] that you wanted me to be from day one so
[2:06:29] I had to go through that fiery trial
[2:06:32] process to be able to get me refined to
[2:06:35] the point where that I could be trusted
[2:06:39] to have the word of God in my mouth
[2:06:43] because the word that God speaks is
[2:06:47] effective it come on right and I want
[2:06:51] you to know that when God speaks a word
[2:06:54] even if it's a cutting word it is
[2:06:57] effective
[2:06:58] word and when it was a word through the
[2:07:02] prophet to bring a kingdom down it was
[2:07:04] an effective
[2:07:08] word that is why we have to go through
[2:07:12] the refining process so the word that he
[2:07:15] puts in our mouth is not our own word
[2:07:18] word but we speak what he says to speak
[2:07:22] we hear from heaven we only we wait
[2:07:26] until that we have a word from the Lord
[2:07:29] to speak and then we speak it because
[2:07:33] his words are effective
[2:07:35] words they're useful words they're
[2:07:38] active they're operative they go and
[2:07:41] they cut down on the inside and they do
[2:07:44] things and if they're operated with an
[2:07:47] improper V in an improper way they can
[2:07:50] do great
[2:07:53] damage and we're too far up the road sir
[2:07:57] for there to be damage done with a real
[2:08:01] true word of God that is operated by an
[2:08:04] unclean vessel so we've got to know that
[2:08:07] we're speaking it with a clean vessel
[2:08:10] out of a pure heart that we know God not
[2:08:14] just across this Pulpit folks but we've
[2:08:17] got to know as uh and communicating to
[2:08:20] one another that we are speaking words
[2:08:23] of
[2:08:24] life amen they may look cutting on the
[2:08:28] surface but if they're a word from God
[2:08:31] they're going to be useful they're going
[2:08:33] to be energizing they're going to be
[2:08:35] effective they're going to be operative
[2:08:38] they're going to be words that are going
[2:08:40] to cause us to become alert they're
[2:08:42] going to be words that are going to
[2:08:43] cause us to say hey I recognize that
[2:08:47] I've gotten out of the I've gotten out
[2:08:49] of the way just a little bit I need to
[2:08:51] get right I got to get right back in the
[2:08:53] middle Get Right Back in
[2:08:55] Balance want you to stand with me all
[2:08:57] over the house
[2:09:02] tonight what do you see
[2:09:06] jermiah I see a rod of an almond
[2:09:10] tree you have seen
[2:09:12] well I will hasten my
[2:09:16] word I am alert dirt and I am active I
[2:09:21] am like that almond tree that blooms
[2:09:25] when it still feels like it's winter
[2:09:27] outside I am alert and I am active and I
[2:09:31] am ready at all times to watch over that
[2:09:34] word that I have already given to make
[2:09:37] sure that it comes to its fruit it may
[2:09:40] take a while to get to the fruit it's
[2:09:42] the first to bloom the last to harvest I
[2:09:45] don't know what that looks like for you
[2:09:47] but I know that there are things that a
[2:09:49] lot of us have been contending for
[2:09:52] through the
[2:09:53] years we've been contending for them
[2:09:57] glory glory glory and sometimes we
[2:10:01] contended with
[2:10:05] murmurings and sometimes we contended
[2:10:08] with faith yes but I just come tonight
[2:10:12] to tell you that the Holy Ghost he is he
[2:10:16] is alert and he is operative Hallelujah
[2:10:20] and he has not only stayed in a place
[2:10:23] where he is above
[2:10:25] us and he is not only where he is with
[2:10:29] us but he has come to dwell inside of us
[2:10:34] he was not content to be as an almond
[2:10:38] looking
[2:10:38] bowl looking on right saying
[2:10:41] everything's good I'm watching over my
[2:10:44] word to perform
[2:10:46] it he came in the form of of a human
[2:10:49] being took on the nature of this human
[2:10:52] flesh and he walked Among Us god with us
[2:10:56] but he knew that that wasn't going to
[2:10:58] work as one individual to get the rest
[2:11:01] of us to get to maturity it was going to
[2:11:04] take God in us it was going to be of
[2:11:08] necessity that he go away he was one
[2:11:12] that came to demonstrate that although
[2:11:15] he was tempted in every way as we are
[2:11:18] yet without sin he demonstrated it and
[2:11:22] then he went back to his original place
[2:11:24] of power and authority and he sent back
[2:11:27] his Spirit on the elect lady he sent
[2:11:30] back his spirit and he said I don't want
[2:11:32] to just be God above you I don't want to
[2:11:35] be God beside of you but I want to be
[2:11:38] God inside of you I want to
[2:11:42] Tabernacle with
[2:11:45] you now can you imagine during the Feast
[2:11:48] of
[2:11:50] Tabernacles when Jesus was walking
[2:11:52] through the city of Jerusalem on his
[2:11:55] last trip to Jerusalem for his the Feast
[2:11:58] of Tabernacles as a human being because
[2:12:00] the following year he would be crucified
[2:12:03] can you imagine as he is disrupting
[2:12:06] all of that going on he is he is there
[2:12:11] he's watching over his word to perform
[2:12:13] it but now he's demonstrated as God With
[2:12:16] Us and he's showing I am here and and
[2:12:19] that pool of silom that ritual that they
[2:12:22] did Where They Carried that water
[2:12:23] picture and all of a sudden God disrupts
[2:12:26] their party and he says if any man
[2:12:29] thirst let him come and drink of the
[2:12:31] water that I
[2:12:37] have he just disrupts
[2:12:40] him and all over the city there are
[2:12:44] these tall candal abas you know one in
[2:12:47] the temple wasn't enough they had to put
[2:12:49] some more up because Herod wanted to
[2:12:51] demonstrate that he could build big so
[2:12:55] they had these candle laas all over the
[2:12:57] city to light the women's G and and so
[2:12:59] the next day after he ruins their pool
[2:13:01] of salom ritual then he's preaching in
[2:13:04] their synagogue and he's disrupting the
[2:13:06] Pharisees and the Sadducees and he you
[2:13:08] know he's speaking to the woman that was
[2:13:10] of ill Fame and and they want a stoner
[2:13:13] and he disrupts that party and he says
[2:13:15] the first one among you cast a stone
[2:13:19] right now they're all proud of these
[2:13:21] lights that are in the
[2:13:24] city and then he says I am the light of
[2:13:27] the
[2:13:30] world and then he comes
[2:13:33] along and he says you are the
[2:13:37] light amen you are the
[2:13:40] light see he's watching over his word to
[2:13:44] perform it because he doesn't want to
[2:13:47] just be God above us he doesn't want to
[2:13:50] just be God With Us doing all the work
[2:13:53] he wants to be God in us fully mature
[2:13:57] sons that are operating in what they've
[2:13:59] been called to do from from the time of
[2:14:02] seed to the time of harvest he wants
[2:14:05] them fully operational in what they've
[2:14:06] been called to
[2:14:08] [Music]
[2:14:09] do and we're here this week to allow him
[2:14:13] to do more of his work in us we're here
[2:14:16] to get rid of our murmurings our
[2:14:18] complainings we're here to say Lord I
[2:14:20] can't be satisfied in this outer court
[2:14:23] and I can't be satisfied in the Holy
[2:14:25] place I've got to get in behind that
[2:14:28] holy of holies I've got to get where the
[2:14:31] real true presence of God is and I want
[2:14:35] to be changed so magnificently
[2:14:39] Hallelujah till that his Aon rud Aaron's
[2:14:43] Rod budded it bloomed and brought forth
[2:14:46] fruit that's what I'm longing for is
[2:14:50] there anybody in this house that has the
[2:14:52] same longing as I have you long to come

[2:27:09] Candlestick when he stood in Heavenly
[2:27:12] places he saw one seven branch
[2:27:18] Candlestick one
[2:27:20] message one word through a
[2:27:24] prophet but when John went into the same
[2:27:28] place before the throne there were now
[2:27:32] seven
[2:27:35] candlesticks with seven
[2:27:38] branches symbolizing a word a message
[2:27:43] that you would send into seven Church
[2:27:46] ages
[2:27:48] there were seven spirits seven lamps
[2:27:51] before your throne there were seven
[2:27:54] divisions of your word that would now go
[2:27:58] forth into the Earth in their alloted
[2:28:01] and appointed
[2:28:03] times and John not only saw the seven
[2:28:06] seven Branch candlesticks the holy
[2:28:10] manora but he saw you in the midst of
[2:28:15] them and the Greek tells us that you
[2:28:18] weren't just walking among them but you
[2:28:21] showed yourself to John as the middle as
[2:28:26] the middle
[2:28:28] Candlestick you were the servant you
[2:28:32] were father we thank you that you were
[2:28:36] the one from which all other branches
[2:28:40] receive their oil and receive their
[2:28:43] light hallelujah hallelujah

[2:40:29] when when the Lord Speaks Over us the
[2:40:31] way to receive it just say
[2:40:33] amen amen amen so be it
[2:40:38] amen amen when the Priestly blessing is
[2:40:41] given
[2:40:42] over the Jewish people during the time
[2:40:45] of seot at the cotel they're answering
[2:40:49] by
[2:40:50] amen amen amen so be it
[2:40:55] Lord so be it
[2:41:01] Lord I I I'm hearing one other thing and
[2:41:04] I I heard it coming from a long way
[2:41:07] away I I I couldn't quite make it out
[2:41:10] yet for for a while but I heard it
[2:41:11] coming from from a from a far away in in
[2:41:16] the realm of the spirit and I hear the
[2:41:19] Lord saying that some of you have fallen
[2:41:21] into a trap of speaking out of both
[2:41:24] sides of your
[2:41:26] mouth because your mind has been
[2:41:33] doubled I hear the Lord saying you've
[2:41:35] tried to operate with two
[2:41:39] minds and I remind you that a
[2:41:41] double-minded man is unstable in all of
[2:41:44] his ways and because you've had two
[2:41:47] minds and two thought processes that are
[2:41:51] entirely opposite of one another it has
[2:41:55] caused you to speak one thing to the
[2:41:58] left and another thing to the
[2:42:01] right and the Lord said that season is
[2:42:03] coming to an end and if you don't let it
[2:42:06] end in your life it's going to cost you
[2:42:09] something the Lord is letting me know
[2:42:12] that the choice is ours and we are going
[2:42:15] going to have to choose to have one mind
[2:42:19] and we're going to have to choose not
[2:42:21] speak to the right or the left but
[2:42:23] straight ahead and it must be in line
[2:42:27] with his word if you're not willing to
[2:42:30] make that choice it's going to be major
[2:42:33] adjustments if you agree there will be
[2:42:37] major
[2:42:39] adjustments some of you may even have to
[2:42:42] go
[2:42:43] back and correct lies
[2:42:48] eyes it will be a huge
[2:42:51] adjustment but the Lord said if you
[2:42:53] refuse to come into agreement with him
[2:42:56] and have one mind and speak one word of
[2:42:59] clarity it'll cost you it's going to
[2:43:01] cost you
[2:43:05] something so tonight Lord we say we are
[2:43:08] willing we are willing you better take
[2:43:11] this serious somebody Lord we're willing
[2:43:15] we recognize that there are times that
[2:43:18] our mind has been
[2:43:20] double we have thought the thoughts of
[2:43:23] Christ and his word and we have thought
[2:43:26] the thoughts of Flesh and carnality and
[2:43:28] because of that we confess before the
[2:43:32] Lord that it has caused us to speak one
[2:43:34] way to the left and another to the right
[2:43:37] but tonight we ask for your Divine
[2:43:39] forgiveness and we ask that you break
[2:43:41] off of us whatever the enemy has tried
[2:43:44] to robe us with that would cause us to
[2:43:47] speak
[2:43:48] confusion and tainted words and even
[2:43:52] lies and we repent of that this evening
[2:43:55] before you Lord and we ask you for
[2:43:58] clarity of your
[2:44:01] thoughts and the grace to choose to
[2:44:05] speak
