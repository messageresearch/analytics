[48:41] remember brother Forrest farmer to the
[48:43] Lord we want to remember brother
[48:45] Daniel's sister Anna's son Joseph and
[48:47] his wife McKinley their daughter Naomi
[48:50] and her husband Trevor and they're also
[48:54] going to be traveling this week and
[48:55] they're going to have fellowship with
[48:56] family they're asking the Lord to be in
[48:59] their travel and in their Fellowship we
[49:01] want to remember Sister Flo having had
[49:03] surgery this week asking the Lord to
[49:05] give her quick recovery would you
[49:08] remember a man by the name of brother
[49:09] Jimmy McNulty the Lord knows the need
[49:12] that he has it's a desperate need but my
[49:15] God is gracious and full of compassion
[49:17] and tender Mercy we want to ask the Lord
[49:19] to be with him did they take his legs
[49:23] they did take both of his
[49:26] both both
[49:29] Let's uh remember Sister Sandy Mann who
[49:32] was uh awakened in the night with the
[49:34] virus very ill needs to be remembered to
[49:37] the Lord in prayer brother Cliff Halls
[49:40] was in the hospital overnight they think
[49:43] it was a light stroke but it had a lot
[49:47] of a lot of effects a lot of things
[49:49] going on at the moment and we want to
[49:51] hold him up to the Lord in prayer and
[49:53] also he and sister Julie's Aunt
[49:57] um Betty lost a daughter and it was
[50:00] rather unexpected and did they didn't
[50:03] even know it they were trying to notify
[50:05] the family for several months and it has
[50:08] uh it's it's affected me a little it
[50:10] weighed heavy on my mind in my heart so
[50:13] would you lift up brother Peter Halls it
[50:15] was his it was his niece let's lift him
[50:18] up to the Lord and believe that God will
[50:20] Undertake and crystalline as most of you
[50:23] know is in the hospital and she has been
[50:26] induced to to for labor which is
[50:28] wonderful because that means the babies
[50:31] are healthy enough to go through vaginal
[50:34] labor instead of a C-section they are
[50:37] estimating that one is three pounds and
[50:40] one is four pounds which is very very
[50:43] doable then Ben was showing me a little
[50:46] baby that was born one pound one ounce
[50:50] is that right Ben yes
[50:53] 24 weeks and doing very well so we just
[50:57] believe I think it's a very good sign
[50:59] that they're letting her deliver and
[51:01] it's with a doctor that a lot of our our
[51:04] young sisters have used and so we give
[51:07] God praise let me give you the last
[51:09] report uh it came in just a few minutes
[51:12] ago
[51:13] just before 11
[51:15] she is five centimeters we talk about
[51:17] things here real plainly I know some of
[51:19] you it bothers you good
[51:21] she's five centimeters but she's fully
[51:24] effaced and they just broke Baby A's
[51:27] water and I believe baby a is Lydia and
[51:31] so now they are they're waiting they're
[51:33] waiting and at the moment crystalline
[51:36] was doing very well with her
[51:38] contractions using lots of humor and the
[51:41] grace of God to get through it so let's
[51:43] believe maybe before we're through here
[51:46] we may have two may have two little
[51:48] Healthy Babies let's just believe the
[51:50] Lord yes amen
[51:55] Hallelujah

[1:08:52] sister Anita and uh
[1:08:58] brother Christian
[1:09:01] have asked me to announce to you that
[1:09:05] you are cordially invited
[1:09:08] the invitations came virtually or uh
[1:09:13] electronically and some of you they did
[1:09:17] not have your phone number
[1:09:19] and so I am to invite all of you who
[1:09:24] wish who would like to share in in their
[1:09:27] celebration together
[1:09:29] next Saturday
[1:09:31] I have
[1:09:33] asked to not perform the ceremony and
[1:09:37] they have graciously allowed me to go
[1:09:40] and be a participant and to maybe for
[1:09:43] once enjoy a wedding
[1:09:46] instead of having to work but I will
[1:09:48] join the other ministers
[1:09:50] in uh praying a prayer of blessing over
[1:09:54] the couple and it's my joy uh and
[1:09:57] Delight to do so but I am very thankful
[1:10:00] that sister Anita understood
[1:10:03] um it's a it's a thing that makes me so
[1:10:06] nervous anyway
[1:10:07] these uh weddings and funerals say I I
[1:10:11] don't enjoy them at all and uh if
[1:10:14] there's one thing I learned when I was
[1:10:16] at the beach
[1:10:19] um there it's this I don't have to do
[1:10:21] what I don't really feel to do
[1:10:26] I know that's hard to hear
[1:10:28] but the Lord really talked to me about
[1:10:31] boundaries
[1:10:33] and I've always tried to stay away from
[1:10:35] those
[1:10:36] when it comes to people but the Lord
[1:10:39] really dealt with my heart about my own
[1:10:41] life my own gift and my own health and
[1:10:44] there are just times that we just can't
[1:10:46] do what people would like for us to do
[1:10:48] or expect us to do and sometimes people
[1:10:51] get their feelings heard and I ask you
[1:10:53] please don't do that the sister Anita
[1:10:56] was so gracious in letting me off the
[1:10:59] hook but let me let me give you the
[1:11:02] information if you would like to take it

[1:15:28] thank the Lord and wish them a happy
[1:15:30] anniversary
[1:15:35] I want to share this with you uh
[1:15:38] since the saints were here
[1:15:41] you know we've been praying for uh our
[1:15:44] former Amish brothers and sisters God is
[1:15:47] blessing them you know part of their
[1:15:49] Amish tradition has been uh not having a
[1:15:54] central meeting place but going from
[1:15:57] home to home
[1:15:58] I don't know if you know this or not but
[1:16:00] brother Jonathan Hollis is is uh
[1:16:03] worshiping with them on Sundays it's a
[1:16:05] couple hour drive but he's driving up
[1:16:07] and he is in his element
[1:16:11] uh you take you take Jonathan and put
[1:16:14] him in Jerusalem and he wears a black
[1:16:16] hat
[1:16:18] and he is Orthodox Jewish
[1:16:21] and you put him in a I mean he just
[1:16:24] adapts very well and you put him in a
[1:16:27] plain culture and he can just adapt and
[1:16:29] he loves it and I like it too because
[1:16:31] it's almost like I've got a little spy
[1:16:33] in the camp and he slips me videos and
[1:16:36] pictures of things as sweet children
[1:16:38] that I might not get to see the sweet
[1:16:41] Children Here worshiping but in at home
[1:16:44] I get to see them and but they are
[1:16:47] building a church and I am so thankful
[1:16:51] so thankful and they they are paying for
[1:16:54] it as they go and uh not borrowing any
[1:16:59] money to do it and so they're thinking
[1:17:02] that it could be several years in the
[1:17:04] making and they're perhaps going to
[1:17:08] close in the basement and it'll have a
[1:17:11] full basement I've already seen a
[1:17:13] picture of what they've done so far
[1:17:14] beautiful going to be a very beautiful
[1:17:17] structure and um they will if if if they
[1:17:21] decide to go this course they will have
[1:17:25] church in the basement for for some time
[1:17:27] but but putting off the Finish date two
[1:17:30] or three years and and I just said to
[1:17:32] the brother I'm not going to believe
[1:17:34] that I'm just not going to believe that
[1:17:36] I love the fact that they're going to
[1:17:39] pay for it as they go I got that I love
[1:17:41] that that's beautiful but I believe that
[1:17:44] the Lord can provide
[1:17:47] I believe he can provide and I don't
[1:17:50] have to say this but uh two times they
[1:17:55] have been very generous to us in our
[1:17:58] fundraising effort to pay off this
[1:18:01] property and I'm so thankful for that
[1:18:04] and they have said we do it because
[1:18:06] we're fed
[1:18:08] also from your ministry there and I
[1:18:11] appreciate that but they didn't have to
[1:18:13] do that and so would you help me pray
[1:18:16] that God Will Make A Way I would like to
[1:18:19] see that building and I know that the
[1:18:21] labor is there and the know-how is there
[1:18:25] and I know that if the Amish can come
[1:18:28] together and build up a barn in one day
[1:18:30] I know if the materials were paid for it
[1:18:33] wouldn't take them two or three years to
[1:18:34] finish that building
[1:18:36] and uh so would you just help me pray
[1:18:40] When you pray that God will will bless
[1:18:43] them and that he will uh provide for
[1:18:46] them in in unusual ways and if at some
[1:18:50] point you want to have a part in that I
[1:18:52] I don't know about you but I've gotten
[1:18:54] to wear these last few years I like to
[1:18:56] have a part in everything
[1:18:59] I do
[1:19:00] I can't maybe I can't uh write a big
[1:19:04] check
[1:19:05] uh but you know what it's not that
[1:19:07] sometimes it's just having a part in it
[1:19:10] and when I hear a young man in the
[1:19:13] message said I want to record a I want
[1:19:16] to record an album I I you know what I
[1:19:18] mean a recording I I want to do that
[1:19:21] I've always wanted to do that and he's
[1:19:22] quite talented and and he said I'm gonna
[1:19:25] have to raise the money to do it well I
[1:19:26] was there one time and I remember
[1:19:29] needing the money to put out the only
[1:19:31] tape I ever put out was Eagle's Wings
[1:19:33] and people helped me some and I
[1:19:36] appreciated it so it was my pleasure to
[1:19:39] sew a little bit into that immediately I
[1:19:41] did it and he said well brother Shelley
[1:19:42] you know I don't even really know you
[1:19:44] that well and it's not about who we know
[1:19:46] it's about all the souls that will be
[1:19:49] blessed and strengthened and encouraged
[1:19:51] and I've given toward funerals of people
[1:19:53] that I never met around this message
[1:19:55] because I think it's a wonderful thing
[1:19:58] to have a part in blessing a family and
[1:20:00] help there have been accidents and there
[1:20:01] have been things that I knew that I
[1:20:03] could fifty dollars or a hundred dollars
[1:20:05] or something like that so if you should
[1:20:07] ever feel that you would like to bless
[1:20:09] those brother others we will make sure
[1:20:11] that it gets in their hands and not only
[1:20:14] that we'll all go up and celebrate the
[1:20:16] dedication of that building at some
[1:20:18] point the little brother and his wife
[1:20:21] who were here uh not not this past
[1:20:24] Fellowship but the one before who live
[1:20:26] in Ohio they're also building a building
[1:20:29] and they've asked me to come and
[1:20:31] dedicate that building when it's
[1:20:32] finished and what I started this whole
[1:20:36] speech about was to tell you that just
[1:20:39] recently since they were here they have
[1:20:41] gone to Ohio to a small community of
[1:20:45] former Amish people and they have been
[1:20:48] reading the supernatural books and have
[1:20:51] been so stirred up praise God
[1:20:55] that they had the Saints to come from
[1:20:57] Indiana to Ohio and they baptized 17 in
[1:21:03] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:05] isn't that wonderful hallelujah praise
[1:21:10] God
[1:21:13] and when I got the report I just said it
[1:21:16] started that Revival that God showed me
[1:21:19] for the Amish
[1:21:21] is coming it's starting
[1:21:24] and I'm so thankful for that and there
[1:21:27] is a group in Wisconsin that they're
[1:21:29] also witnessing to and and brother
[1:21:31] Emmanuel Byler who comes and sits on the
[1:21:35] front here from Kentucky uh he and his
[1:21:38] wife just accompanied them to Wisconsin
[1:21:41] this past week and there were some
[1:21:43] things going on there including a
[1:21:45] funeral very sad uh 45 year old Amish
[1:21:49] woman who who lost her battle with
[1:21:52] cancer and they were there for that but
[1:21:54] also for some other Ministry and I
[1:21:57] thought that was so wonderful that
[1:21:58] brother Byler and his wife because he is
[1:22:01] former Amish and I thought it was so
[1:22:04] wonderful that he could go and have
[1:22:05] Fellowship in that community and and
[1:22:08] they can work for the Lord
[1:22:10] I will be happy when the word comes back
[1:22:12] to me that every Amish community in
[1:22:15] America is being stirred for the message
[1:22:17] of the hour
[1:22:18] God is more than able to do that
[1:22:21] and it started with brother and sister
[1:22:23] Miller in Missouri they were the
[1:22:26] forerunners they're the ones who gave me
[1:22:28] hope they're the ones who encouraged me
[1:22:30] and strengthened me to keep believing
[1:22:32] for the vision to come to pass and now
[1:22:35] we see it coming to pass and I'm so very
[1:22:38] very thankful for it and I wanted to
[1:22:41] share that with you let's stand let's go
[1:22:44] to the word of God everybody all right
[1:22:48] I know you wanted to hear that good news
[1:22:51] and God bless all of you who are
[1:22:53] streaming uh the gossmans and the van
[1:22:57] hoodens in Netherlands and brother Stacy
[1:23:00] in Trinidad uh brother Merle in Arizona
[1:23:04] and so many of you and Brother David and
[1:23:09] sister Debbie Gossman cousins have been
[1:23:13] streaming with us for a few weeks now
[1:23:15] and we just welcome them and we hear
[1:23:18] that they're uh interested in coming
[1:23:20] here for a visit and they've been
[1:23:22] sharing the services with friends of
[1:23:24] theirs who perhaps are interested to
[1:23:26] come for a visit and that just excites
[1:23:29] us
[1:23:30] because God's doing some amazing things
[1:23:33] oh I wished I could tell you a few
[1:23:35] things but we have to wait until it's a
[1:23:37] little further down the road uh you know
[1:23:40] we there's some things we don't want the
[1:23:41] devil to know about
[1:23:44] we fly under the radar sometime
[1:23:46] because like brother banham said if
[1:23:48] Satan should get a hold of that he'd do
[1:23:50] a lot of damage
[1:23:53] oh if we knew what some of these
[1:23:55] brothers think we know
[1:23:57] we'd have been in worse shape than we're
[1:23:59] in now if Satan would have got a hold of
[1:24:01] some of that but he won't
[1:24:03] it won't be released until the very end
[1:24:06] of time just in time to get the bride
[1:24:09] sweep in
[1:24:10] and get us out of here
[1:24:12] aren't you glad
[1:24:14] Romans chapter 8 beginning in verse 27
[1:24:19] through 39 it's a long reading
[1:24:24] I'm going to I'm going to charity just
[1:24:26] for your information I'm going to skip
[1:24:28] those first two quotations and pick them
[1:24:31] up maybe Tuesday night since I took so
[1:24:33] much time works is Faith expressed in
[1:24:36] trying to do God a service I'll pick
[1:24:38] those up maybe Tuesday night or another
[1:24:40] time and I'm going to go straight after
[1:24:43] reading this scripture I'm going to go
[1:24:45] straight to the quotations that were a
[1:24:48] part of the March 28th notes and then
[1:24:52] and then move forward
[1:24:54] and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth
[1:24:58] what is the mind of the spirit because
[1:25:02] he make it intercession for the Saints
[1:25:06] read that
[1:25:09] according to the will of God I love it
[1:25:12] and we know that
[1:25:15] all things
[1:25:21] that love God to them who are
[1:25:24] the called according to his purpose let
[1:25:28] me ask you are there any
[1:25:30] Saints here today who identify as being
[1:25:34] called according to the purpose of the
[1:25:37] Lord all right we've got a house full of
[1:25:39] them then now we go on
[1:25:41] for whom he did for no
[1:25:45] he also did
[1:25:47] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:25:51] image of his son
[1:25:53] that he might be what the firstborn or
[1:25:58] the first fruits among many brethren
[1:26:03] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:26:08] he also called and whom he called them
[1:26:13] he also
[1:26:15] Justified and whom he justified them he
[1:26:20] also
[1:26:21] glorified this is very important that we
[1:26:25] get a hold of the the five steps there
[1:26:28] are five steps in your Redemption
[1:26:31] and that is being foreknown being
[1:26:34] predestinated being called being
[1:26:37] justified and being glorified Grace five
[1:26:41] steps
[1:26:42] to your Redemption
[1:26:45] and they are a part of your destiny book
[1:26:48] are you with me
[1:26:49] and so it in I know this if you're a
[1:26:52] part of that bride these five steps are
[1:26:54] outlined in your destiny book you were
[1:26:57] foreknown
[1:26:59] you were predestinated you were called
[1:27:02] you have been Justified you are being
[1:27:06] glorified and then it's done
[1:27:09] isn't that good news
[1:27:11] what shall we say then to these things
[1:27:14] if God before us
[1:27:19] what Democrat
[1:27:23] what king what potentate
[1:27:26] can be against us
[1:27:28] he that spared not his own son but
[1:27:32] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[1:27:38] not with him also freely give us
[1:27:43] freely give us all things not ration
[1:27:48] down freely freely give us all things
[1:27:52] who
[1:27:54] you you can't say who
[1:27:57] you've got to say who
[1:28:00] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:28:04] God's elect
[1:28:06] you better be careful blaming the elect
[1:28:09] of God
[1:28:11] you better be careful accusing the elect
[1:28:14] of God
[1:28:16] you better be careful judging the elect
[1:28:19] of God
[1:28:21] it is God that justifieth
[1:28:23] who is he that condemneth it is Christ
[1:28:28] that died yea rather that is risen again
[1:28:32] who is even at the right hand of God
[1:28:36] which is not at the right hand of a
[1:28:38] person but at the right hand of power
[1:28:41] and authority who also maketh
[1:28:45] intercession for us so God makes
[1:28:50] intercession for us through Christ
[1:28:54] and also through the Holy Spirit
[1:28:59] one person
[1:29:01] one eternal spirit two offices
[1:29:05] I want to tell you something you've got
[1:29:07] three offices
[1:29:09] you've got three distinct works of God
[1:29:13] three distinct personalities or offices
[1:29:16] our administrations of God all
[1:29:18] interceding the spirit the same but all
[1:29:21] interceding on another level on a
[1:29:24] different level for your life you can't
[1:29:27] lose
[1:29:28] you can't lose
[1:29:31] you've got all of God making
[1:29:33] intercession for you
[1:29:35] powerful isn't it
[1:29:37] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:29:40] Christ
[1:29:42] I like it that way who shall and then it
[1:29:45] goes to what
[1:29:48] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:29:50] Christ it doesn't start naming people
[1:29:54] are enemies that start it starts naming
[1:29:57] Watts
[1:29:58] shall tribulation
[1:30:00] no or distress no or persecution no our
[1:30:06] famine no our nakedness no or Peril no
[1:30:10] our sword
[1:30:11] what is the answer
[1:30:13] no
[1:30:15] none of that
[1:30:17] as it is written for thy sake we are
[1:30:20] killed all the day long we are accounted
[1:30:23] as sheep for the slaughter why because
[1:30:25] we're called to lay down our lives
[1:30:28] we can't take it up and try to live it
[1:30:30] out of our own will anymore we must live
[1:30:33] it out of Holy Spirit
[1:30:34] now in all day
[1:30:37] nigh no
[1:30:41] low in Hebrew
[1:30:43] in all these things we are
[1:30:48] we're not conquerors
[1:30:52] we're more than conquerors
[1:30:54] we're like the wife that stayed home
[1:30:58] we're not like the man who went and won
[1:31:00] the boxing match he's a conqueror we're
[1:31:03] like the wife who stayed home and waited
[1:31:05] on the paycheck
[1:31:08] he gets home she meets him at the door
[1:31:11] handed over
[1:31:12] he gives her the paycheck for the
[1:31:14] victory that he won
[1:31:16] so he's a conqueror what is she
[1:31:19] Jesus won the battle he went to the
[1:31:21] boxing match he defeated the enemy in
[1:31:24] every part in every way and every
[1:31:26] fashion is that right and he hands you
[1:31:28] the check bride of Christ wife of the
[1:31:31] Lord
[1:31:31] he hands you the check and he says nay
[1:31:34] in all these things you are more than
[1:31:36] conquerors through him that loved us
[1:31:39] for I am persuaded and that is not a
[1:31:43] feeling of persuasion is much more uh
[1:31:46] much more much deeper than that it is a
[1:31:49] passionate decision
[1:31:51] for I am persuaded that neither death
[1:31:55] nor life
[1:31:58] nor angels nor principalities
[1:32:04] nor powers nor things present nor things
[1:32:09] to come nor height nor depth nor any
[1:32:14] other creature shall be able to separate
[1:32:17] us from the love of God which is in
[1:32:21] Christ Jesus our lord nothing is left
[1:32:25] out nothing can separate us from the
[1:32:28] love of God nothing that happens can
[1:32:31] separate may God add his Blessing to the
[1:32:34] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:32:37] Paul lists five distinct steps
[1:32:42] to our destiny Redemption
[1:32:46] they may somehow overlap one another
[1:32:50] but they are distinct enough to study
[1:32:54] them individually
[1:32:56] and we have done that here but the Lord
[1:32:59] brings us back to them again
[1:33:02] we are going to look perhaps Tuesday
[1:33:05] night we will look again at the Ancient
[1:33:08] of Days
[1:33:09] the white wigged one the one who
[1:33:12] sometimes confuses people when they're
[1:33:15] reading that the one that John saw
[1:33:19] uh on the Isle of Patmos in in the
[1:33:23] glorified Christ
[1:33:25] he appeared not with brown hair of a
[1:33:29] middle eastern man but are dark black
[1:33:33] hair of a middle eastern man but he he
[1:33:36] appeared as one whose hairs were white
[1:33:41] like wool as white as snow how did John
[1:33:46] describe his eyes
[1:33:49] they were as a flame of fire
[1:33:53] that's powerful isn't it John was seeing
[1:33:57] the glorified Christ the Christ who had
[1:34:00] resurrected and ascended his
[1:34:03] glorification did not take place only in
[1:34:06] the resurrection he then had to ascend
[1:34:10] and he fulfilled then the whole
[1:34:14] testimony of the Feast of firstfruits
[1:34:17] and the Bible said he made us we talked
[1:34:21] about this Tuesday evening he made us
[1:34:24] accepted in the Beloved you are accepted
[1:34:29] I want you to know something people may
[1:34:31] not accept you down here
[1:34:33] they may not understand you down here
[1:34:36] you may face more rejection than you do
[1:34:39] acceptance but you need to remember
[1:34:41] you're not living on the acceptance of
[1:34:44] other people
[1:34:46] you're not functioning by how other
[1:34:48] people react to you you are accepted by
[1:34:52] the Beloved
[1:34:53] you are foreknown predestinated call
[1:34:56] Justified and glorified and the devil
[1:34:59] doesn't know what to do with you
[1:35:02] somebody help me a little bit he doesn't
[1:35:05] know what to do with you because you're
[1:35:07] living out of your destiny scroll
[1:35:09] you're living out of those five steps of
[1:35:12] redemption you have been foreknown you
[1:35:16] have been predestinated you have been
[1:35:18] called you have been Justified and you
[1:35:22] are being glorified
[1:35:24] you're in the process of your
[1:35:26] glorification
[1:35:28] he's getting your robe ready
[1:35:32] the same road brother random said he
[1:35:34] dressed Christ in on the day of
[1:35:35] transfiguration
[1:35:37] which is the day of his glorification
[1:35:40] so glorified so transfigured before
[1:35:42] their eyes that light penetrated and
[1:35:46] inhabited the cells of his body
[1:35:50] and purest light began to shine out of
[1:35:53] the pores of his skin
[1:35:57] God dressed him
[1:36:00] in a robe of glory and that same robe
[1:36:04] and it was the robe that said it was the
[1:36:09] robe that he wore that testified hear ye
[1:36:13] him
[1:36:15] when the father gave him that robe it
[1:36:18] said to the whole Community hear what he
[1:36:20] has to say he's a fully adopted son when
[1:36:24] God drapes that
[1:36:26] when God drips
[1:36:29] when he droops
[1:36:32] drapes
[1:36:34] that robe on your shoulder the message
[1:36:37] will be the same
[1:36:41] hear him
[1:36:44] hear her
[1:36:46] she doesn't speak of herself anymore
[1:36:49] he said speak of himself anymore he only
[1:36:52] speaks of the glorified Christ isn't
[1:36:55] that powerful you're not acting like it
[1:36:58] that's powerful
[1:37:00] all right so let's look at these first
[1:37:03] steps of our Redemption process
[1:37:08] we could mark them in our destiny scroll
[1:37:13] they are there
[1:37:15] we may not be able to identify the very
[1:37:18] moment that he first knew us
[1:37:20] but he can
[1:37:23] he knows the very moment that he thought
[1:37:25] about you first
[1:37:27] all I know is the scripture said it's
[1:37:29] before the foundations of the earth were
[1:37:31] laid that's all I know I don't know what
[1:37:34] day time had not yet been created so I
[1:37:38] don't know what day what time what month
[1:37:40] it was it was in eternity Hallelujah but
[1:37:44] there was a moment that God thought
[1:37:46] about you first and that is his
[1:37:50] foreknowledge and I'm telling you
[1:37:53] foreknowledge is very important as we
[1:37:57] talked about the last Tuesday night of
[1:37:59] March the word foreknowledge in the
[1:38:02] Greek means to know beforehand it means
[1:38:06] to be previously acquainted with it
[1:38:10] means to determine or choose beforehand
[1:38:14] it means to foreordain as in First Peter
[1:38:19] 1 20. it means to foresee and to appoint
[1:38:24] as the subject of future privileges so
[1:38:29] for Christ to foreknow you it means that
[1:38:33] he appointed you as a subject of future
[1:38:37] privileges Hallelujah
[1:38:40] he saw you and he chose you to have his
[1:38:44] authority and he chose you to eventually
[1:38:47] function in his power and he chose you
[1:38:50] to be an overcomer like he was an
[1:38:51] overcomer and he accepted you
[1:38:59] for knowledge speaks of that which has
[1:39:01] already occurred in the counsel of the
[1:39:04] Lord
[1:39:05] and I want you to know the counsel of
[1:39:07] the lord it's not just a meeting of the
[1:39:09] minds
[1:39:10] the counsel of the Lord is a meeting in
[1:39:13] his mind
[1:39:14] and when the Bible said let us make man
[1:39:17] in our image it wasn't a conference
[1:39:19] table with three Gods sitting in chairs
[1:39:21] it was a conference that took place in
[1:39:24] his mind and everything that he was and
[1:39:27] every function that he would have and
[1:39:30] every office that he would hold they
[1:39:32] conferred together as one
[1:39:35] let us make man in our image
[1:39:38] the god that that Jaya was singing about
[1:39:40] Elohim
[1:39:42] he is a God who is one yet many
[1:39:45] not many in in persons
[1:39:49] hear ye o Israel the Lord thy God is one
[1:39:53] it's not a trinity of persons it's not
[1:39:56] God the Father God the son and God the
[1:39:58] Holy Ghost all coming together to talk
[1:40:02] they were having a baptism and brother
[1:40:04] she all sent it to me and and and you
[1:40:07] know the church they just want to
[1:40:08] baptize people in titles
[1:40:11] finally they started hollering at the
[1:40:13] man no he wants to do it in the name of
[1:40:15] Jesus so right at the end he slaps the
[1:40:17] name of Jesus on him
[1:40:19] as an afterthought
[1:40:22] it's more than an afterthought
[1:40:25] if you've not been baptized in the name
[1:40:27] of the Lord Jesus Christ by immersion
[1:40:29] you've never received Christian baptism
[1:40:33] if all you've ever received is entitles
[1:40:35] you've not received full Christian
[1:40:37] baptism if all you've ever had was
[1:40:40] sprinkling you haven't received full
[1:40:42] baptism
[1:40:44] it's by immersion and it's in the name
[1:40:46] of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our
[1:40:49] Messiah
[1:40:51] this was a council that took place in
[1:40:55] the mind of God so don't look at it like
[1:40:57] council members coming together to sit
[1:41:00] down
[1:41:01] God just had the thought
[1:41:03] and every part of who he was accepted
[1:41:07] the challenge
[1:41:12] did you read there where it said Jesus
[1:41:14] intercedes for you the Holy Ghost
[1:41:17] intercedes for you there it is right
[1:41:18] there
[1:41:19] in that moment that God foreknew you
[1:41:23] he had knowledge of you beforehand
[1:41:26] he thought of you in that moment every
[1:41:29] part of who God is agreed
[1:41:34] they came in agreement every office that
[1:41:37] he would fulfill father son Holy Ghost
[1:41:40] agreed in that moment to work
[1:41:44] to do all that was necessary
[1:41:48] to get you to full Redemption
[1:41:51] you talk about angels on your side
[1:41:53] you've got God Almighty fighting for you
[1:41:56] I love the Angels but you've got
[1:41:59] something higher than the angels and
[1:42:01] that that's higher than the Angels is
[1:42:03] determined for you to make it I want you
[1:42:05] to know you're going to make it
[1:42:08] if you repent of your sins if you're
[1:42:11] baptized in the name of Jesus Sanctified
[1:42:14] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:42:15] and filled with the walking talking Holy
[1:42:18] Ghost
[1:42:19] receiving the message of the hour and
[1:42:23] sealed to the bride you're going to make
[1:42:25] it
[1:42:26] because all of God is hanging on whether
[1:42:28] you make it or not it's not your
[1:42:31] reputation or my reputation or brother
[1:42:33] branham's reputation that's at stake
[1:42:34] it's God who promised for whom he did
[1:42:37] for no
[1:42:40] in this Council decisions were made
[1:42:44] about Destinies in the Earth
[1:42:46] not only in that beginning did God
[1:42:49] determine how the Earth would be and
[1:42:51] what percentage of the earth would be
[1:42:53] water and what percentage of the earth
[1:42:55] would be land how many planets he would
[1:42:57] hang in the sky how many stars and
[1:43:00] constellations and and and how they how
[1:43:03] that things would play out not only did
[1:43:05] he do that but Destinies were determined
[1:43:08] in that moment that God thought about
[1:43:10] you first
[1:43:12] powerful
[1:43:14] so there were there were Destinies of
[1:43:16] individuals determined there were
[1:43:19] Destinies of cities determined did you
[1:43:22] know it was God who chose Jeffersonville
[1:43:25] Indiana
[1:43:27] did you know it was God who chose Tucson
[1:43:30] Arizona to see what those cities saw
[1:43:35] to experience a Revival that those
[1:43:37] cities experienced various other PL do
[1:43:41] you know it was God who chose Azusa
[1:43:43] Street
[1:43:45] it could have happened on any Street in
[1:43:47] Los Angeles it could have happened in
[1:43:49] any city in America
[1:43:51] but God chose the City of Angels
[1:43:55] even though it's wicked and he's going
[1:43:57] to send it to the bottom of the ocean
[1:43:58] one day
[1:44:00] he chose it for Pentecost to be birthed
[1:44:03] in the Earth
[1:44:04] he chose an ignorant one-eyed black man
[1:44:09] despised hated and misunderstood to be
[1:44:13] the vessel
[1:44:15] that he would use to bring that
[1:44:17] Pentecostal outpouring to the Earth God
[1:44:20] chose that
[1:44:22] he chose this place
[1:44:25] he chose this County
[1:44:28] he chose this property
[1:44:30] we're here today because of vision put
[1:44:33] us here you ought to help me
[1:44:35] a vision put us here this wasn't the
[1:44:38] first property we looked at
[1:44:40] I walked several properties
[1:44:43] I really liked one of the properties
[1:44:46] that we saw
[1:44:49] I've pretty much fell in love with it
[1:44:52] there was a problem
[1:44:54] we couldn't make it match the vision
[1:44:59] so we had to walk away from it
[1:45:01] because it didn't match the vision
[1:45:04] the trees were where the trees were
[1:45:06] supposed to be the Cedars weren't where
[1:45:08] the Cedars were supposed to be
[1:45:10] and so we had to walk away flat
[1:45:14] High Ground
[1:45:16] perkable ground
[1:45:21] beautiful heavy heavily uh
[1:45:25] forests heavily populated Forest it
[1:45:29] hadn't been stripped of its Hardwood
[1:45:31] an old home place right up in the middle
[1:45:35] of it
[1:45:36] that had fallen in
[1:45:38] and hauled away but that one of my
[1:45:41] favorite things is an old fireplace out
[1:45:44] in the middle of the field
[1:45:46] sitting out in the middle right in the
[1:45:48] middle of them trees hidden from The
[1:45:51] View until you got out there was one of
[1:45:53] those big old beautiful fireplaces that
[1:45:56] was all that remained of the home place
[1:45:58] and and I had Visions all right
[1:46:02] I could see how beautiful that would be
[1:46:04] but it didn't meet the vision
[1:46:08] what was her name
[1:46:11] faith
[1:46:13] from the real estate agent
[1:46:16] she said preacher I got another place
[1:46:20] it ain't all that pretty
[1:46:22] but she said you might like it
[1:46:25] I can't think of her last name right now
[1:46:28] she said I'll show it to you
[1:46:31] she got
[1:46:33] told us where it was and we met her over
[1:46:35] here and it looked like a burned over
[1:46:38] wilderness
[1:46:41] the man and his wife who lived up there
[1:46:44] with where brother Hawkins sister
[1:46:45] Marybeth live they had divorced and they
[1:46:49] wanted to get every last dollar out of
[1:46:51] this land they could and they stripped
[1:46:54] the hardwood and there was ruts big
[1:46:56] enough for a school bus to go down in
[1:46:59] because they were in such a hurry to
[1:47:02] strip the land that they just it was
[1:47:04] such a muddy wet mess and they kept
[1:47:07] running those big machines through here
[1:47:09] to take that hardwood out and I could
[1:47:12] have I could have stepped down in one of
[1:47:14] those ruts and you wouldn't have seen me
[1:47:16] from anywhere on this property a school
[1:47:18] bus could have laid down in them
[1:47:20] but there was that was all right
[1:47:24] but I walked down I got all the way down
[1:47:27] down to the bottom and come come across
[1:47:30] through there like that and I started up
[1:47:32] a hill
[1:47:34] there was a cedar tree had fallen over
[1:47:37] or a tree had fallen over and my I
[1:47:40] looked down in my
[1:47:41] shoestring was untied
[1:47:44] and I reached down to tie my shoestring
[1:47:47] and when I looked up there were those
[1:47:49] cedar trees in the formation that God
[1:47:52] had showed them to me in a vision and I
[1:47:55] burst in tears
[1:47:57] and I said the same words it ain't
[1:47:59] pretty
[1:48:02] but this is the place
[1:48:04] that God wants to establish this
[1:48:08] ministry
[1:48:09] you're here because God had it in his
[1:48:13] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:48:16] that we would be gathered here this
[1:48:19] morning on this paper piece of property
[1:48:21] somebody said don't you think that's
[1:48:23] going a little far no
[1:48:26] no I don't believe it at all I could get
[1:48:29] way more specific than that you drove
[1:48:31] over here in the car that God knew you
[1:48:34] were going to have
[1:48:35] you sat down by the companion that God
[1:48:38] knew you were going to have
[1:48:40] you helped dress the children that God
[1:48:43] knew you were going to have to get them
[1:48:45] to church today you picked up the guitar
[1:48:47] and sat down to the drums
[1:48:52] chose the songs that God knew you were
[1:48:55] going to sing
[1:48:57] somebody said how is that possible
[1:48:59] because his foreknowledge is beyond our
[1:49:02] human capability of of understanding
[1:49:06] you think God's gonna lose one of us
[1:49:09] you think he's going to let you perish
[1:49:11] in some horrible way without finishing
[1:49:14] your destiny if you leave here tomorrow
[1:49:17] you can be assured that if I'm called on
[1:49:20] to say something at your funeral I will
[1:49:22] not get up and say your life was cut
[1:49:25] short
[1:49:29] that's what the newspapers say when
[1:49:31] somebody dies younger
[1:49:34] but let me tell you something when
[1:49:35] before you were ever born God knew your
[1:49:38] exit date
[1:49:41] he didn't only know the day you were
[1:49:42] going to enter he knew the day you were
[1:49:44] going to exit and every day of your life
[1:49:46] is written in his book scripture said so
[1:49:49] you can trust a God Like That
[1:49:51] you can trust a god like that you can
[1:49:54] trust a god like that if you make a
[1:49:57] choice that was not in his perfect plan
[1:49:59] for you he knows how to squeeze you back
[1:50:04] he knows how to get you back to that
[1:50:07] perfect path that he's chosen for you
[1:50:09] why don't we just trust him and pray and
[1:50:12] try to find out what he'd have us to do
[1:50:14] before we get a miss
[1:50:16] oh yes
[1:50:19] from the Council of the Lord there was a
[1:50:21] foreknowing about us all of this
[1:50:24] occurred Before Time
[1:50:26] now let me get these quotes in real
[1:50:28] quick I need to hurry these some of
[1:50:30] these we shared with you on that Tuesday
[1:50:31] night but I want to get them in here for
[1:50:34] the record paragraph nine
[1:50:36] of the message how the angel came to me
[1:50:39] in his Commission
[1:50:41] brother random said all these things is
[1:50:43] God's foreknowledge
[1:50:45] when he spoke of them what would be he
[1:50:48] foreknew it
[1:50:50] now God in order to be God at the
[1:50:55] beginning
[1:50:56] he had to know the end
[1:51:02] you believe that
[1:51:04] we got to live like we believe that or
[1:51:07] he wasn't the end for the God God's not
[1:51:10] willing
[1:51:12] that any should perish
[1:51:14] there he corrects this crazy idea about
[1:51:18] predestination that is so twisted and
[1:51:21] misunderstood
[1:51:23] he corrects that by saying it was not
[1:51:26] the will of God that any should perish
[1:51:30] but he only knew their choice
[1:51:34] he only foreknew their decision
[1:51:38] God is not willing that any should
[1:51:40] perish let's read on certainly not he
[1:51:43] doesn't want anyone to perish but at the
[1:51:46] beginning of the beginning of the days
[1:51:48] The World God knew just exactly who
[1:51:51] would be saved and who would not be
[1:51:54] saved if you believe that's amen
[1:51:57] if you don't believe it what do you
[1:51:59] believe
[1:52:00] do you believe we write our own destiny
[1:52:04] that's what they teach our children in
[1:52:05] public school
[1:52:08] that we make our own destiny that's not
[1:52:10] what the Bible teaches
[1:52:12] we don't make our own destiny we follow
[1:52:14] God's Destiny for our lives
[1:52:17] he doesn't want anyone to perish but at
[1:52:19] the beginning of the days The World God
[1:52:21] knew exactly who would be saved and who
[1:52:23] would not be saved he didn't want the
[1:52:25] people to be lost
[1:52:27] it's not his will that any should be
[1:52:29] lost but it's his will to save everybody
[1:52:32] but he knew from the beginning who would
[1:52:35] and who would not that's the reason he
[1:52:38] could foresee
[1:52:40] he foreknew because he foreknew he could
[1:52:44] say in advance this thing will happen
[1:52:46] that thing will happen this will be that
[1:52:49] this person will be that way see are you
[1:52:52] with me
[1:52:53] he would foreknow it because he's
[1:52:55] infinite if you know what it means
[1:52:57] that's just there's nothing that he
[1:52:59] doesn't know
[1:53:00] see he knows well there's nothing from
[1:53:03] Before Time and after and there's and
[1:53:06] after there's no more time see
[1:53:08] he still knows everything everything is
[1:53:11] in his mind and then as Paul said in
[1:53:14] Romans the 8th and 9th chapter then why
[1:53:16] does he still find fault so we so we see
[1:53:19] that but God
[1:53:22] like preaching the gospel
[1:53:24] someone said brother Brandon do you
[1:53:26] believe that I said look said you must
[1:53:28] be calvinist I said I'm calvinist as
[1:53:31] long as calvinist is in the Bible what a
[1:53:33] good answer now there's a limb on the
[1:53:35] tree that's Calvinism but there's more
[1:53:37] limbs on the tree also or true or two a
[1:53:40] tree has more than one limb he just
[1:53:42] wanted to run it on out there into
[1:53:45] eternal security and after a while
[1:53:48] you see I believe in eternal security
[1:53:53] but he said after a while you go on off
[1:53:56] into universalism
[1:53:58] see if you stay on the Calvinism limb
[1:54:01] and you keep beating down that limb you
[1:54:04] step out of the scripture
[1:54:06] so brother Adam said I follow Calvin as
[1:54:08] long as Calvin was teaching the Bible I
[1:54:10] follow the Armenians as long as they
[1:54:12] were teaching the Bible but when they
[1:54:14] start getting into that universalism
[1:54:16] that everyone will be saved
[1:54:18] he said you drop off out there somewhere
[1:54:21] there's no end to it but when you get
[1:54:23] through with Calvinism come up start on
[1:54:25] armenianism see there's another limb on
[1:54:28] the tree and another limb on the tree
[1:54:29] just keep on the whole thing together
[1:54:31] makes the tree so I believe in Calvinism
[1:54:34] as long as it stays in the scripture and
[1:54:37] I believe that God knew before the
[1:54:40] foundation of the world chose his church
[1:54:43] in Christ and slayed Christ
[1:54:49] not 2 000 years ago
[1:54:52] but slayed Christ before the foundation
[1:54:56] of the world in his mind
[1:55:00] the lamb was slain in the mind of God
[1:55:03] before the foundation of the world then
[1:55:06] in the in due time in the right time in
[1:55:09] the right moment in the right hour are
[1:55:11] you with me I'm asking because I don't
[1:55:14] know whether you are or not
[1:55:16] then in the right season and in the
[1:55:19] right moment Christ came
[1:55:21] lived his life performed the father's
[1:55:24] will
[1:55:25] died on the cross
[1:55:28] resurrected ascended
[1:55:31] let the Holy Ghost be poured out on the
[1:55:34] day of Pentecost
[1:55:35] finishing the Plan of Redemption but
[1:55:38] this plan wasn't formed at Calvary it
[1:55:42] was formed Before Time
[1:55:45] he said he knew us
[1:55:47] and predestinated us into the adoption
[1:55:49] of the children by Jesus Christ before
[1:55:51] the world was ever formed he said that's
[1:55:53] God that's our father see
[1:55:55] and then it is the rising of the sun
[1:55:57] paragraph 243 well how can the Bride
[1:56:00] come and fail to manifest everything was
[1:56:03] promised of him and the groom come and
[1:56:06] he wouldn't be the bride but when he did
[1:56:09] everything even to proving it by raising
[1:56:12] himself up from the dead afterwards then
[1:56:14] don't the bride have to do the same
[1:56:15] thing oh yes she's got to prove
[1:56:18] something have to be exactly what the
[1:56:21] word said she would be in these last
[1:56:23] days don't she have to return through
[1:56:25] Malachi 4 don't she have to be
[1:56:27] manifested like it was in the days of
[1:56:29] Sodom don't the world have to be put
[1:56:31] just exactly like it is isn't these
[1:56:34] things a perfect identification of the
[1:56:36] word of God made known to us the answer
[1:56:39] to all of that is what yes
[1:56:42] he said look notice this but God foresaw
[1:56:45] the bride and where was she
[1:56:48] in the groom
[1:56:50] where was Eve in the original Creation
[1:56:52] in Adam
[1:56:54] where was the bride when Christ was
[1:56:56] formed in Christ
[1:56:59] Hallelujah see to save his wife like
[1:57:01] Adam he had to go with her Adam knowed
[1:57:04] what he was doing Eve didn't know what
[1:57:06] she was doing but Adam walked out with
[1:57:08] his wife
[1:57:10] see
[1:57:12] Jesus took his wife's place and became
[1:57:15] sin for her somebody ought to rejoice
[1:57:18] remember he became you
[1:57:20] he stood your punishment that you might
[1:57:23] stand in his place he stood in your
[1:57:26] place that you might stand in his place
[1:57:31] what a love what a fellowship how can we
[1:57:34] deny it how can we do anything but love
[1:57:36] him friend I could still never ours but
[1:57:38] let's move on a little farther in the
[1:57:40] message Satan's Eden now that's the way
[1:57:43] God was in the beginning every Son of
[1:57:45] God every daughter of God was in God at
[1:57:48] the beginning
[1:57:49] you don't remember it now
[1:57:51] but you were there
[1:57:54] isn't that something he wanted you to
[1:57:57] become so he could contact you speak
[1:58:00] with you love you shake your hands
[1:58:05] that's powerful
[1:58:07] in the message Hebrews chapter 7 number
[1:58:10] one he's not willing that any should
[1:58:13] perish certainly not but if he's God he
[1:58:15] knowed who would be saved and who
[1:58:16] wouldn't be saved or he didn't know
[1:58:18] anything
[1:58:19] if he didn't know who would make the
[1:58:21] Rapture before the world was ever formed
[1:58:26] then he's not God
[1:58:28] do you all realize the churches don't
[1:58:30] teach such a thing as that
[1:58:33] they they teach it in such a way that
[1:58:35] God's going to be surprised when he sees
[1:58:37] you come in the rapture
[1:58:39] oh I didn't think you were going to make
[1:58:41] it
[1:58:43] how many of you know that's not the way
[1:58:44] it is at all
[1:58:46] no he knowed every flea
[1:58:51] I love this one
[1:58:53] every fly every loss
[1:58:56] every
[1:59:01] there's a bunch of them to know in
[1:59:03] Alabama

[1:59:07] earth before the Earth was ever formed
[1:59:09] listen now ever flee every fly every
[1:59:12] louse every that would ever be
[1:59:14] on the earth when did he know it before
[1:59:16] the Earth was ever formed that's right
[1:59:18] he knew all things before the foundation
[1:59:20] of the world he knew us the Bible said
[1:59:21] he knew us and did what
[1:59:24] and predestinated us now that is that's
[1:59:27] just good stuff First Peter chapter one
[1:59:30] verse 2 clearly says elect
[1:59:38] according to the foreknowledge of God
[1:59:42] the Father
[1:59:44] through sanctification of the spirit
[1:59:50] unto obedience and sprinkling of the
[1:59:54] blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and
[1:59:56] peace be multiplied Peter greeting the
[1:59:59] Saints
[2:00:00] and calling them the elect
[2:00:04] according to the foreknowledge of God
[2:00:06] wake up in here
[2:00:12] what a joy
[2:00:14] to know
[2:00:16] that you could be greeted the same way
[2:00:18] you that are awake
[2:00:22] if you're asleep you won't even know
[2:00:23] you're being greeted
[2:00:26] elect according to the foreknowledge of
[2:00:30] God
[2:00:31] somebody said but brother Shelley you
[2:00:33] don't know how hard we worked all week
[2:00:34] let me tell you something none of that
[2:00:37] is going to help you make the rapture
[2:00:40] I appreciate good work hard work
[2:00:42] faithful work I appreciate that but none
[2:00:45] of that is going to make you Rapture
[2:00:46] Ready this word will make you ready for
[2:00:49] the rapture
[2:00:51] this is more important than your Sunday
[2:00:53] afternoon nap I'm not mad
[2:00:55] well you're getting mad now I'm not mad
[2:00:58] I'm just telling you I respect you
[2:01:00] enough
[2:01:02] that if you are talking to me I'm gonna
[2:01:04] stay away and hear what you have to say
[2:01:07] even with my boundaries
[2:01:09] [Music]
[2:01:10] and I want you to respect the word that
[2:01:13] much
[2:01:14] now there's cold water in the bathroom
[2:01:19] and what I really don't understand is a
[2:01:21] wife that'll sit beside her husband and
[2:01:23] let him sleep
[2:01:26] well I'm afraid he's gonna hit me not in
[2:01:28] here he's not
[2:01:32] or a husband that sit beside his wife
[2:01:34] and let her sleep through the servant
[2:01:36] jerk her
[2:01:37] in love
[2:01:41] wake up
[2:01:43] we'll sleep another time
[2:01:46] come on I'm not mad
[2:01:48] it is true somebody ought to say it
[2:01:53] now then number two predestinated we're
[2:01:56] foreknown and then predestinated
[2:02:00] once these decisions were made and
[2:02:03] choices made in the mind of God they
[2:02:06] were then written down here's what I
[2:02:07] want you to understand the difference
[2:02:09] between foreknowledge and predestination
[2:02:12] foreknowledge is a thought
[2:02:16] he thought it and then he wrote it
[2:02:21] when it was written it became a
[2:02:24] pre-fixed destiny
[2:02:27] I don't know if the Finger of God wrote
[2:02:30] it
[2:02:31] our recording Angels wrote it or the
[2:02:34] Heavenly Host wrote it but once it
[2:02:38] became written down it's no longer just
[2:02:41] a thought it's now a thought expressed
[2:02:43] it becomes a word you move from the
[2:02:46] Redemption of by foreknowledge to the
[2:02:49] Redemption of predestination
[2:02:51] it's wonderful
[2:02:53] once they were written down recorded in
[2:02:55] a Heavenly book or scroll
[2:02:57] once they were written in that book of
[2:02:59] Heaven it became a predestinated thing
[2:03:02] then that's the next stage that Paul
[2:03:04] spoke about in Romans 8 and that word
[2:03:07] predestinated means to limit or Mark
[2:03:10] beforehand
[2:03:15] to design definitely beforehand
[2:03:20] to ordain
[2:03:22] beforehand to prefix boundaries
[2:03:26] beforehand
[2:03:29] you can only go so far
[2:03:31] some really ran from God let me see your
[2:03:34] hand if you'd say I ran from God look at
[2:03:37] the hands I ran from God
[2:03:40] but you could only run so far
[2:03:43] because his foreknowledge was towards
[2:03:45] you and he wrote your destiny down and
[2:03:49] he knew exactly how far you'd go he knew
[2:03:51] who you'd make fun of he knew what you'd
[2:03:53] say he knows some of the Terrible Things
[2:03:55] you'd say about the faith
[2:03:57] but he allowed it
[2:04:00] he knew that you would mock others
[2:04:03] along the way at times but he only
[2:04:06] allowed you to do so much of that
[2:04:07] because you were living in the prefixed
[2:04:10] boundaries of his predetermined plan oh
[2:04:13] thank you thank you thank you thank you
[2:04:16] thank you Lord
[2:04:18] thank you Lord from the Council of the
[2:04:20] Lord his foreknowledge God then wrote in
[2:04:22] a book the decisions and choices made
[2:04:25] that would be our reason for existence
[2:04:27] on the planet
[2:04:28] what God thought about you in the
[2:04:30] beginning became his recorded will for
[2:04:32] you in predestination we should only
[2:04:35] involve ourselves in the things that are
[2:04:38] important to heaven
[2:04:39] it is each one's individual
[2:04:41] responsibility to discover what was
[2:04:44] foreknown about them and then
[2:04:46] predestinated about them as it was
[2:04:48] recorded in heaven it's not my place to
[2:04:51] tell you or your place to tell me
[2:04:53] it's each individual laying in the
[2:04:57] presence of the Lord until you discern
[2:04:59] the heartbeat and will of God for your
[2:05:01] life and when you do you better get up
[2:05:04] and make sure that you are busy
[2:05:07] yes
[2:05:09] I want to tell you something that's not
[2:05:11] the Lord on some of you that got your
[2:05:12] little feelings in in a Twist that's not
[2:05:15] the Lord doing that for you that's your
[2:05:17] soul alive you want to know if your soul
[2:05:20] is still alive it's testifying this
[2:05:22] morning very much still alive
[2:05:26] push him out of the way push that big
[2:05:28] old sumo wrestler out of the way let
[2:05:31] your spirit feed on the word
[2:05:34] yes get your mind will and emotions and
[2:05:37] feelings and all that push I have to do
[2:05:40] it often
[2:05:41] I hear some awful things said
[2:05:48] there's a few churches I stream every
[2:05:50] week
[2:05:52] I hear some powerful things said but I
[2:05:55] hear some awful things say it
[2:05:59] I I I got real amazed this week because
[2:06:02] a father preached a sermon
[2:06:05] and then and a good band a wonderful man
[2:06:09] but in that sermon he's preaching about
[2:06:11] how how we you know we better be careful
[2:06:14] with our enthusiasm and we better be
[2:06:17] careful with our emotionalism and we
[2:06:19] better be careful the way we worship and
[2:06:21] get you know that's for the immature
[2:06:28] my
[2:06:29] then God decided to pour the Holy Ghost
[2:06:32] out on 120 immature men on the day of
[2:06:35] Pentecost didn't he they were they were
[2:06:37] mature enough that he trusted him with
[2:06:39] his power
[2:06:41] that don't hold any water
[2:06:43] and how we need the how we need love
[2:06:46] which true all that's true
[2:06:49] there's a Time
[2:06:50] to scream a little differently than we
[2:06:52] once screamed
[2:06:54] conduct ourselves a little differently
[2:06:56] than we once conducted ourselves but we
[2:06:58] don't we don't squeeze people out
[2:07:03] I ought not to say this I'm getting I'm
[2:07:05] going to get in trouble I think but I
[2:07:07] here's what really got me
[2:07:10] they called on a brother to pray in the
[2:07:12] service and he prayed this way
[2:07:14] and he didn't mean this
[2:07:16] you better be careful what you prayed
[2:07:20] he said Lord I Thank you for the all the
[2:07:22] preaching that goes across on this
[2:07:24] Pulpit because you know it quenches our
[2:07:26] spirit
[2:07:31] I said oh brother you didn't mean that
[2:07:35] you meant it quenches The Thirst we all
[2:07:38] I get twisted up in my words
[2:07:41] but God knew what was about to be said
[2:07:44] and then a few few the next service the
[2:07:47] son is preaching and he's preaching
[2:07:50] almost the very opposite of that we need
[2:07:53] an experience
[2:07:54] we need to be excited about what God's
[2:07:57] doing in this hour and I'm thinking poor
[2:08:00] people and it's everywhere folks it
[2:08:01] could be right here if we allowed it to
[2:08:03] be here this is not throwing any stones
[2:08:06] at anybody or anywhere it's just saying
[2:08:08] somebody ought to get together and make
[2:08:10] up their mind what they're going to
[2:08:11] preach
[2:08:13] Hey Brother Greeley and I are going to
[2:08:15] preach opposite of one another we got to
[2:08:16] have a little meeting somewhere we got
[2:08:19] to talk this thing out because the
[2:08:21] people are the ones that suffer in an
[2:08:22] atmosphere like that let me tell you
[2:08:24] what brother Tim Pruitt said
[2:08:29] somebody mentioned to me said you you
[2:08:31] ought to go back and hear that little
[2:08:33] exhortation that brother Pruitt gave at
[2:08:36] the close of the Sunday morning service
[2:08:38] last Sunday morning as the Youth Camp
[2:08:40] was was closing out
[2:08:45] and and I did hear a piece of it
[2:08:47] I heard the rules
[2:08:49] I heard that you need to go and get your
[2:08:53] things out of the dorm and and how they
[2:08:54] do because they're closing the camp down
[2:08:56] and pick up after yourself and and then
[2:08:59] people started coming in my office I
[2:09:00] guess and I didn't hear the rest of it
[2:09:02] so I went back this week and it was some
[2:09:04] of the wisest advice it was some of the
[2:09:07] most precious truth I I think I've about
[2:09:09] ever heard given to young people that
[2:09:13] were about to go back to all kinds of
[2:09:14] different versions of churches
[2:09:17] of different levels of life
[2:09:21] and death
[2:09:26] and this is what he said and I wrote it
[2:09:28] down and put it on my screen
[2:09:30] I I posted it to my on a Post-It note he
[2:09:34] said I want to encourage you to feed
[2:09:38] your experience
[2:09:43] does that sound like quenching something
[2:09:46] does that sound like only the immature
[2:09:48] get excited
[2:09:49] no he said to the young people something
[2:09:52] very wise and something that needed to
[2:09:54] be said he said now God met you here
[2:09:56] this week
[2:09:58] he met you here he lets you experience
[2:10:01] his presence now when you go home you
[2:10:04] may be the only one excited
[2:10:09] he said but here's the way feed your
[2:10:12] experience
[2:10:14] hello ship what God did for you remind
[2:10:18] the Lord
[2:10:21] I want more of that
[2:10:25] it's not our emotion it's not our
[2:10:28] screaming it's not our jumping around
[2:10:30] but it testifies that life is present
[2:10:36] it says I'm not a corpse
[2:10:41] bride
[2:10:45] brah she's a living moving breathing
[2:10:48] wife
[2:10:49] of Jesus Christ
[2:10:52] I thought to myself oh I hope every
[2:10:55] young person will feel that way because
[2:10:57] he said listen it only takes two or
[2:10:59] three of you
[2:11:02] to go turn your church upside down now
[2:11:05] if you think that's been critical of
[2:11:06] other churches no I I'm gonna be honest
[2:11:08] with you somebody every now and again
[2:11:10] has got to say it
[2:11:14] he said it only takes two or three of
[2:11:15] you
[2:11:17] to go home to your church and continue
[2:11:20] to Worship the Lord the way you have
[2:11:23] worshiped him here
[2:11:26] you can make a difference
[2:11:30] by entering in
[2:11:32] you can make a difference
[2:11:37] now what these brothers are are warning
[2:11:40] us about
[2:11:41] is getting so emotional in the worship
[2:11:46] and shutting our mouth when it comes
[2:11:49] time to feed
[2:11:52] it's not that any of those things I I've
[2:11:55] heard were wrong
[2:11:57] it's just we're looking at things from
[2:11:59] two different approaches
[2:12:02] I don't have confidence in people that
[2:12:05] hoop and holler and jump and scream and
[2:12:07] shout and Carry On In Worship
[2:12:13] and then shut their mouths and sleep
[2:12:15] during the preaching
[2:12:18] [Music]
[2:12:21] it's got to be the balance
[2:12:23] so here's an older brother looking at it
[2:12:25] from one hand and the younger brother
[2:12:27] looking for it from another end and
[2:12:28] where it's the truth always in the
[2:12:30] middle
[2:12:31] no criticism
[2:12:33] it's in the balance it's always in the
[2:12:35] middle we must we we've got to have a
[2:12:37] little life
[2:12:38] brother said if we don't he said that
[2:12:40] rut just you kick out both ends and it
[2:12:42] becomes a grave
[2:12:44] come on now
[2:12:46] we are foreknown predestinated
[2:12:51] it's each one's individual
[2:12:53] responsibility
[2:12:55] to discover what was foreknown about
[2:12:57] them and then predestinated about them
[2:12:59] as recorded in the books of Heaven
[2:13:02] brother Phantom said something very
[2:13:03] powerful about predestination he said it
[2:13:06] looks back to foreknowledge
[2:13:08] and foreknowledge looks back to Destiny
[2:13:11] I want to say that again predestination
[2:13:13] looks back to foreknowledge and
[2:13:15] foreknowledge looks to Destiny not looks
[2:13:17] back looks too
[2:13:20] predestination looks back to
[2:13:21] foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to
[2:13:25] to Destiny
[2:13:27] in second Timothy chapter 1 and verse 9
[2:13:31] the Bible said who hath saved us
[2:13:34] and called us with an holy calling
[2:13:38] not according to our works this is from
[2:13:41] the notes of February excuse me of March
[2:13:43] 28th
[2:13:45] not according to our works it might not
[2:13:48] actually it actually might not have been
[2:13:49] there so that's okay not according to
[2:13:52] our works
[2:13:53] but according to his own purpose and
[2:13:56] Grace
[2:13:57] which was given us
[2:13:59] in Christ Jesus before the world began
[2:14:01] let me read it again
[2:14:03] second Timothy 1 9 who hath saved us and
[2:14:07] called us with an holy calling not
[2:14:10] according to our works but according to
[2:14:12] his own purpose and Grace which was
[2:14:15] given us in Christ Jesus before the
[2:14:20] world began
[2:14:22] now purpose
[2:14:24] and Grace
[2:14:26] purpose it's what's written in the book
[2:14:29] Grace is a special empowerment
[2:14:33] to work out and to fulfill what was
[2:14:37] written in your purpose
[2:14:39] purpose and Grace but according to his
[2:14:41] own purpose and Grace
[2:14:44] so it's not just what he chose for you
[2:14:46] or purpose for you but he also provides
[2:14:49] the grace
[2:14:51] how many of you are thankful for the
[2:14:53] grace
[2:14:54] to do what he's called us to do
[2:15:03] Eric little or Liddell
[2:15:06] in the movie Chariots of Fire
[2:15:10] where he chose to honor God
[2:15:13] by not running on the Sabbath this is an
[2:15:15] old movie
[2:15:17] this is what he said how many of you
[2:15:18] have ever seen the film Chariots of Fire
[2:15:23] you give up
[2:15:26] because he wanted to honor the day that
[2:15:30] belonged to the Lord
[2:15:31] and listen what he said about it he said
[2:15:33] when I run I feel the pleasure of God
[2:15:39] this statement reveals that he had
[2:15:41] discovered for this season of his life
[2:15:43] the purpose
[2:15:45] for which he had been graced
[2:15:48] it's very very important that in every
[2:15:50] season of our life we ask God to reveal
[2:15:53] to us what his purpose for us is in the
[2:15:55] season so that we can identify the grace
[2:15:58] that he's willing to endow upon us
[2:16:01] to help us get through every situation
[2:16:06] so there's two stages here foreknowledge
[2:16:08] and then predestination and and both of
[2:16:11] these stages of redemption took place
[2:16:14] before the Earth began Before Time began
[2:16:18] so not only did he foreknow you in
[2:16:20] eternity he predetermined your destiny
[2:16:23] in eternity
[2:16:25] the prophet goes on to tell us in the
[2:16:28] message where I think Pentecost failed
[2:16:30] paragraph 28
[2:16:34] but if we'd only go back to find out
[2:16:38] when God made his first man he made man
[2:16:41] in his own image
[2:16:43] and God is a spirit
[2:16:46] so he had to make
[2:16:48] Spirit man
[2:16:51] now the word is used here in the fifth
[2:16:54] verse of predestination
[2:16:57] predestinated it's not a very good word
[2:17:00] for an evangelist or a minister to use
[2:17:02] because it kind of confuses people when
[2:17:05] you say predestinate did you know there
[2:17:08] are people that get witness to from some
[2:17:10] of you and when you tell them you
[2:17:12] believe in predestination they will tell
[2:17:14] you right up front that's false Doctrine
[2:17:17] how could the Bible be full of false
[2:17:19] Doctrine
[2:17:22] if predestination is a false Doctrine
[2:17:24] how come the Bible said to them before
[2:17:26] knew to them he also did predestinate no
[2:17:29] it's not a false Doctrine unless someone
[2:17:31] takes it out of the boundaries of the
[2:17:33] scripture
[2:17:34] you see the Primitive Baptist used to
[2:17:36] take it out of the parameters of the
[2:17:38] scripture and if a man come out in the
[2:17:40] holler and Shout a Man In Cold Blood
[2:17:45] the southern baptist would say get the
[2:17:48] devil out of that man
[2:17:50] the Primitive Baptist would have said he
[2:17:52] was predestinated to do that
[2:17:56] the pre the the error of predestination
[2:17:59] is taking any any choice
[2:18:03] out of a man
[2:18:07] God having a prefix Destiny for you did
[2:18:11] not rob you of your choice
[2:18:15] here's the balance
[2:18:17] you can choose to live according to his
[2:18:19] purpose and he will give you the grace
[2:18:21] to do it
[2:18:23] or you can choose to live your own will
[2:18:26] graceless
[2:18:28] how many of you have ever lived a season
[2:18:30] in the School of Hard Knocks
[2:18:32] without the grace of God to cover you
[2:18:34] and help you why
[2:18:36] because you chose
[2:18:38] to live outside of his purpose for your
[2:18:40] life he is not obligated to provide
[2:18:42] Grace
[2:18:43] to help you get through when you have
[2:18:46] chosen to live out of his purpose and
[2:18:49] plan
[2:18:50] so it's not that that some it's not that
[2:18:53] this gang or whatever went on up here in
[2:18:56] Dadeville
[2:18:57] as I was coming to church the news was
[2:19:00] just beginning to come out at least 20
[2:19:02] people shot
[2:19:04] at a sweet 16 birthday party Downtown
[2:19:06] Dadeville last night
[2:19:08] four or five killed
[2:19:12] after church we will know more about how
[2:19:14] many were killed because they were the
[2:19:15] information was still just coming out
[2:19:19] and people there celebrating a sweet 16
[2:19:24] they're saying that almost the entire
[2:19:26] group of the 20 are teenagers
[2:19:29] now predestination is not what made some
[2:19:32] gang go up there and do that kind of
[2:19:34] shooting or individual or what we don't
[2:19:36] know they think it was somehow
[2:19:38] gang-related
[2:19:40] Fayetteville Alabama
[2:19:42] not Chicago
[2:19:46] Backwoods America
[2:19:49] now whoever did such a terrible thing
[2:19:51] they were not predestinated to do it
[2:19:54] they did that on their own
[2:19:57] they made their own choice and they did
[2:19:59] it on their own and they're going to
[2:20:00] have to pay the price
[2:20:02] if they get caught
[2:20:04] but if you are walking according to
[2:20:07] God's will for your life he provides
[2:20:10] Grace to get her done
[2:20:12] aren't you glad
[2:20:14] aren't you glad
[2:20:16] because you could never do it without
[2:20:18] him
[2:20:19] it kind of confuses people when you say
[2:20:21] that predestinate predestination speaks
[2:20:25] it looks back to foreknowledge
[2:20:27] foreknowledge looks to destination
[2:20:31] predestination goes back to
[2:20:33] foreknowledge foreknowledge goes to
[2:20:36] destination in other words God didn't
[2:20:39] say now I'll let I'll make this man be
[2:20:42] this and I'll make this man to be that
[2:20:46] but in order to be God
[2:20:48] he had to know the end
[2:20:50] from the beginning
[2:20:52] see the balance
[2:20:53] so in order to foreknowledge that he
[2:20:56] knew he could say this would happen and
[2:20:57] that would happen because he was God and
[2:21:00] he knowed where everything would be
[2:21:01] placed and therefore he could ordain
[2:21:03] certain things for certain ages you
[2:21:04] believe that he said that is truly
[2:21:07] scripture that's what the Bible said
[2:21:11] now in the message Jehovah Jireh
[2:21:14] paragraph 12 he said so we have to be
[2:21:17] what we are we have to be what we are
[2:21:22] gifts and callings are without
[2:21:24] repentance
[2:21:25] when you were born in this world before
[2:21:28] the world ever began God knew you
[2:21:30] positionally placed you
[2:21:32] if that isn't so
[2:21:35] then the Bible isn't so
[2:21:37] he said that's exactly now look at this
[2:21:39] God put our names on the Lamb's Book of
[2:21:43] Life
[2:21:45] not when you come to the altar
[2:21:50] but before the foundation of the world
[2:21:54] he said that's right that's what the
[2:21:55] Bible said
[2:21:58] so every person that would ever be saved
[2:22:01] their name is recorded already
[2:22:03] in the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:22:05] so we can sing all day long there's a
[2:22:07] new name written down in glory but we
[2:22:10] all know that's not exactly the way it
[2:22:11] works
[2:22:12] he said so that's what the Bible said
[2:22:14] when was the lamb slain you read it for
[2:22:16] me would you
[2:22:19] before the foundation of the world and
[2:22:21] when the lamb was slain
[2:22:24] your name
[2:22:26] my name
[2:22:28] was put on his book
[2:22:34] God by his foreknowledge saw all things
[2:22:38] he's infinite he know the end from the
[2:22:41] beginning he isn't willing but then he
[2:22:43] should perish that's not his desire but
[2:22:45] being God he had to know who would
[2:22:48] and who would not like Esau and Jacob
[2:22:54] he hated one and loved the other one
[2:22:56] before they were even born and had a
[2:22:58] chance to do anything because he was God
[2:23:00] and he knowed all things now people
[2:23:02] struggled with that but it is the word
[2:23:05] that is what the scripture said isn't it
[2:23:09] now Jehovah Jireh number one and we'll
[2:23:13] we'll close we won't get too far but
[2:23:16] we'll close in a minute
[2:23:19] he said now this unconditional Covenant
[2:23:24] he said not if you will I will
[2:23:28] but I will later on or something like
[2:23:30] that
[2:23:31] I have already give the land to you and
[2:23:34] your seat after you amen he said see
[2:23:37] already done it it's a finished work
[2:23:40] you say to Abraham he did that yes not
[2:23:44] only to Abraham
[2:23:45] hello
[2:23:47] but what
[2:23:49] to his seat after him
[2:23:51] and if we're Abraham's seed it's a
[2:23:53] finished product
[2:23:55] those who he foreknow he called those
[2:23:59] who he called he justified those who he
[2:24:03] has Justified he has already glorified
[2:24:07] in his mind
[2:24:12] you're just like him
[2:24:14] in his mind
[2:24:17] you've defeated every devil you're ever
[2:24:19] going to fight
[2:24:21] in his mind
[2:24:23] that's powerful
[2:24:25] so if he should come and say you're
[2:24:27] going to make it
[2:24:28] it's not based on his limited knowledge
[2:24:32] it's based on his infinite knowledge
[2:24:34] you're gonna make it
[2:24:36] he said what you're scared about
[2:24:40] why are you afraid
[2:24:42] let's go on
[2:24:44] in the Antichrist in the last days
[2:24:46] according to Revelation deceived all
[2:24:49] that dwelt upon the face of the Earth
[2:24:50] whose names
[2:24:55] they were in his foreknowledge
[2:24:58] but they weren't a part of his
[2:24:59] predestinated plan
[2:25:03] said he deceived all that were upon the
[2:25:05] face of the Earth whose names were not
[2:25:07] written in the Lamb's Book of Life since
[2:25:09] the last Revival no
[2:25:12] before the foundation of the world
[2:25:17] that's when your name was put in the
[2:25:19] Lamb's Book of Life when the lamb was
[2:25:21] slain
[2:25:23] God spoke the word it was in his
[2:25:26] thinking in his thought he spoke the
[2:25:28] word and everything happened just at
[2:25:30] that time
[2:25:31] this is just God's seed materializing
[2:25:34] that's all his words coming down now
[2:25:37] when the light of God flashes across
[2:25:39] that quickly that seed recognizes it
[2:25:42] because it's born of God it's Abraham's
[2:25:45] seed foreknowed by God that's why the
[2:25:48] light flashes is to catch the seed
[2:25:55] that flashing light is a very important
[2:25:57] element of of what God's doing in this
[2:26:00] last day that's the Holy Ghost making
[2:26:02] the word real in you it's materializing
[2:26:05] the word in your life when that flashing
[2:26:07] light comes by the spirit I don't mean
[2:26:09] some physical light that you can see
[2:26:11] flashing I mean Revelation flashes on
[2:26:14] the word
[2:26:15] that's why you've got to be alert
[2:26:17] because the light flashes on that word
[2:26:20] and for that word to become activated in
[2:26:22] you you've got to be under that
[2:26:24] he said we've had a Revival Joel said we
[2:26:26] fuss so much about latter rain had
[2:26:28] movements called ladder rain later rain
[2:26:30] former rain in a rain out of rain he
[2:26:33] said I was reading the other day do you
[2:26:35] know what former rain means in the
[2:26:36] Hebrew word I can't call it right now
[2:26:39] I never wrote it down and skipped my
[2:26:41] mind
[2:26:42] but former Reign the first Reign Means A
[2:26:46] Reign of teaching
[2:26:50] the second Reign is the spirit that
[2:26:52] comes of what upon what's been taught
[2:26:55] and produces the crop that's Moray
[2:27:01] there is an early Reign that comes and
[2:27:03] gets the ground ready
[2:27:06] and then there is a ladder rain that
[2:27:08] comes to bring the crop to maturity
[2:27:10] where are we
[2:27:13] are we in former rain
[2:27:16] that was teaching rain
[2:27:24] when the word is being taught
[2:27:26] when the truth is being re-established
[2:27:31] when the light is shining on the word
[2:27:34] is that former rain or latter rain
[2:27:38] that's former rain
[2:27:40] God is getting the ground ready and the
[2:27:43] teaching is going forth and the word is
[2:27:46] being restored that's what we had a
[2:27:48] generation ago
[2:27:58] when the spirit of God comes just before
[2:28:01] the crop
[2:28:02] is mature and it rains again
[2:28:06] is that former rain or later rain
[2:28:08] that's latter rain
[2:28:10] that's Harvest maturity rain
[2:28:14] that's what we're crying out for in this
[2:28:16] hour that's what we're beginning to
[2:28:18] experience in these days come on now
[2:28:21] is maturity Harvest maturity rain ladder
[2:28:24] rain so we are not out of order if we
[2:28:27] get up and sing this is the promise of
[2:28:28] the coming latter rain that's not out of
[2:28:30] order
[2:28:31] you're just going to have a bunch of
[2:28:33] message people tell you when the latter
[2:28:34] rain's already fallen at Pentecost
[2:28:37] but here let me tell you this there's
[2:28:39] another Harvest cycle going on right now
[2:28:41] this isn't Pentecost
[2:28:44] there's another Harvest cycle
[2:28:46] every time the seed goes into the ground
[2:28:48] it has to keep it has to come right back
[2:28:51] and in the natural Harvest cycle there's
[2:28:53] one every year
[2:28:55] spiritually I don't think there's a
[2:28:57] harvest cycle every year but there is a
[2:29:00] harvest cycle seed goes in the ground
[2:29:03] because rain has prepared the soil and
[2:29:06] crops come forth and produce because the
[2:29:09] rain has come
[2:29:10] brother random said it rains on the just
[2:29:12] and the unjust quoting the scripture
[2:29:14] and he had the vision of those little
[2:29:16] grains those little little
[2:29:18] wheat
[2:29:21] he said they all raised up their hand
[2:29:23] and said praise the Lord
[2:29:27] the tariffs
[2:29:29] manifested and produced tears
[2:29:34] what did the real seed produce
[2:29:37] It produced real wheat
[2:29:39] because what goes into the ground is
[2:29:41] What comes forth in maturity
[2:29:43] anybody still here
[2:29:47] he said the second rain is the spirit
[2:29:50] that comes upon what's been taught
[2:29:53] I never wrote today said but former
[2:29:55] Reign the first rain Means A Reign of
[2:29:57] teaching the second rain is the spirit
[2:29:59] that comes about what has been taught
[2:30:01] and produces the crop
[2:30:05] so many of our Brethren would like to
[2:30:07] say that was the Revival that swept the
[2:30:09] earth when brother Branham was on the
[2:30:10] scene
[2:30:12] if that be the case then where is the
[2:30:15] produced crop
[2:30:20] I'm going to ask this I think I've
[2:30:22] already upset some folks so I might as
[2:30:23] well upset some more
[2:30:27] where are the 120 William branhams
[2:30:30] [Music]
[2:30:35] so I said what in the world are you
[2:30:36] talking about uh Jesus went in the grave
[2:30:40] and the devil danced with Glee
[2:30:43] he said we've killed the son of God
[2:30:46] he nearly had a nervous breakdown three
[2:30:49] days later three days three nights later
[2:30:52] when Jesus got up from the grave
[2:30:55] he said oh no I thought I killed him
[2:30:59] he needed a nerve pill didn't he
[2:31:02] what do you think he needed some few
[2:31:04] days later on the day of Pentecost
[2:31:07] when the very same Jesus
[2:31:11] that was manifested in one body it's now
[2:31:14] manifested in 120 bodies that quickly
[2:31:18] became three thousand
[2:31:21] [Applause]
[2:31:23] Jesus was that finished seed
[2:31:28] first fruits waved over the people
[2:31:30] We Believe brother random was the same
[2:31:32] in his day
[2:31:34] so then where are the 120 William
[2:31:36] branhams
[2:31:39] not in that office
[2:31:41] we're just looking for men and women who
[2:31:43] can produce the same Life of Christ that
[2:31:45] he produced and we have not seen that
[2:31:56] but we will
[2:32:00] we will
[2:32:02] talk about a nerve pill he's going to
[2:32:04] need more than a nerve pill when the
[2:32:06] bride's Revival reaches its full tilt
[2:32:09] and you've got you've got way more than
[2:32:11] 120 little bride members manifesting the
[2:32:14] very life of Jesus Christ calling those
[2:32:17] things that are not as though they are
[2:32:19] missing limbs being restored and
[2:32:21] stepping over ananiasis and survivors
[2:32:35] people get quiet because they think of
[2:32:37] their own loved ones
[2:32:40] the same God who graced you out can
[2:32:42] Grace them out
[2:32:44] don't ever forget that just put it in
[2:32:46] his hands
[2:32:47] and if we're Abraham's seed it's a
[2:32:49] finished product
[2:32:56] why is it that we had such a Revival
[2:32:58] Pentecostal Baptist all the other trees
[2:33:00] put forth their buds
[2:33:03] as Jesus said they would be
[2:33:09] and what have we hatched out
[2:33:12] the Baptist said they got a million more
[2:33:14] and 44.
[2:33:16] look at the Catholic how they increase
[2:33:18] look at all denominations look at
[2:33:20] Pentecost what did we do we sowed
[2:33:22] denominational seeds
[2:33:37] we reap denominational Harvest
[2:33:40] that same denominational spirit that
[2:33:43] attacked the early church that same
[2:33:45] denominational spirit that attacked the
[2:33:48] church on the day of Pentecost same
[2:33:50] denominational spirit that attacked the
[2:33:52] church at Azusa Street is the same
[2:33:54] denominational spirit that has attacked
[2:33:56] the the bride's message
[2:34:01] so we sowed mixed seeds
[2:34:04] and we're reaping a mixed Harvest
[2:34:07] but instead of being discouraged and
[2:34:09] giving up we say what do we do we sow
[2:34:11] again
[2:34:12] and this time we make sure that only the
[2:34:14] pure word goes into the field so that
[2:34:16] when the Harvest comes up it's pure word
[2:34:18] babies
[2:34:26] why the church ought to be on fire for
[2:34:28] God right now
[2:34:30] he said if there had been a word seed
[2:34:32] sowed back there and there would be
[2:34:33] signs wonders Miracles and that church
[2:34:35] would be together one heart one Accord
[2:34:37] marching toward Zion for the Rapture
[2:34:40] that's right he said what did we do we
[2:34:42] had intellectual speeches instead of the
[2:34:44] word we had reasoning against the word
[2:34:46] and everything else don't get too
[2:34:49] excited
[2:34:52] don't get emotional
[2:34:56] he said we've got to get back to the
[2:34:58] word
[2:34:59] we'll do we'll do it God said I will
[2:35:01] restore saith the Lord all the years at
[2:35:03] the canker worm and Palmer worms eat
[2:35:05] it's going to bloom out in the evening
[2:35:07] time there will come forth one with a
[2:35:08] message he'll restore the hearts of the
[2:35:10] faith of the children back to the faith
[2:35:12] of the fathers what fathers
[2:35:14] [Music]
[2:35:17] not the Baptist fathers
[2:35:21] the Pentecostal fathers
[2:35:24] he promised it in Malachi 4 that he
[2:35:26] would do it return them back again
[2:35:29] what we did not expect was that delay
[2:35:34] once God restored his word through his
[2:35:36] messenger we expected the Harvest
[2:35:39] immediately to follow and that's why
[2:35:41] brother Branham said I look when I look
[2:35:43] out there I could predict it'll all be
[2:35:44] over by 77.
[2:35:46] because what God was doing in the 60s it
[2:35:49] certainly looked like that the crop that
[2:35:51] was going to come after that would sweep
[2:35:53] to the rapture
[2:35:55] but what happened the seed got mixed
[2:35:57] going in the ground
[2:35:59] you want me to tell you how it got mixed
[2:36:01] I know this is kind of just for a few
[2:36:02] people will understand it but but I
[2:36:04] won't tell you you know how it got mixed
[2:36:06] by people coming along said we didn't
[2:36:08] really mean that
[2:36:11] that's not really how he meant that
[2:36:14] you can't really take that like that you
[2:36:16] can't take that literal and every time
[2:36:18] something like that all you got to read
[2:36:20] between the lines
[2:36:21] [Music]
[2:36:22] he's telling us he's not Jesus because
[2:36:24] he wants to throw us off this is the
[2:36:27] kind of talk we heard
[2:36:33] somebody rolls up and said well you're
[2:36:35] you're baptizing in his name and
[2:36:37] somebody said well isn't that better
[2:36:38] than being baptized in titles no
[2:36:41] same Pagan lie
[2:36:43] same demonic spirit
[2:36:47] anybody with me and so that causes the
[2:36:50] mixture
[2:36:52] and so we have to come a whole
[2:36:53] generation past that
[2:36:56] still crying out for the Harvest the
[2:36:58] full Harvest had there not been a
[2:37:01] harvest no one would have preserved the
[2:37:03] word for us
[2:37:04] thank God for the generals thank God for
[2:37:06] the men who went before us thank God for
[2:37:09] those who stayed true to the word
[2:37:13] but we are children in the sense that we
[2:37:16] now must take that
[2:37:19] and do something with it
[2:37:22] got to get back to the word he said I'll
[2:37:24] restore saith the Lord all the years
[2:37:26] that canker worm and Palmer worms it's
[2:37:28] going to Blue Mound in the evening time
[2:37:30] now one more
[2:37:31] spoken words The Original Seed paragraph
[2:37:33] 420 it's 132 musicians can come and get
[2:37:37] ready
[2:37:40] he said notice what Harmony
[2:37:43] Jesus never did anything until seen of
[2:37:46] the father or the father showed him
[2:37:48] first Harmony between God and Christ see
[2:37:51] John 5 19 so will the bride
[2:37:56] and he shows her his Word of Life
[2:38:01] he shows her and she receives it
[2:38:04] she never doubts it nothing can harm her
[2:38:07] anybody hearing this not even death for
[2:38:11] if the seed be planted
[2:38:13] the water will raise it up again
[2:38:16] amen then I got a great big Hallelujah
[2:38:18] here is the secret
[2:38:21] here's the secret go tell somebody
[2:38:23] here's the secret the word is in the
[2:38:26] bride
[2:38:27] the mind of Christ
[2:38:31] this is purpose and Grace
[2:38:34] the word is in the bride and the mind of
[2:38:37] Christ to know what he once done
[2:38:41] with the word purpose and Grace
[2:38:44] and she does it in his name
[2:38:48] she
[2:38:50] has thus
[2:38:52] saith
[2:38:54] the Lord she who the bride she has thus
[2:38:58] saith the Lord then it is dermatized so
[2:39:02] the Holy Spirit Waters it it until it is
[2:39:05] grown and does what
[2:39:08] serves its purpose
[2:39:10] they do only his will this is what we're
[2:39:13] looking for this people
[2:39:15] amen I'll believe that no one can
[2:39:18] persuade them different
[2:39:24] calm down
[2:39:26] you'll settle down
[2:39:32] you want me to call names
[2:39:39] it kept me up all night
[2:39:41] in my motel room
[2:39:47] literally petted me on my head like a
[2:39:50] child
[2:39:52] and said when you get mature you'll
[2:39:55] settle down
[2:39:57] you're way too excited
[2:40:00] for this move
[2:40:09] if I were to yield to that
[2:40:11] I manifest I'm not the seed
[2:40:15] because they do only his will
[2:40:19] amen I'll believe that he said no one
[2:40:22] can persuade them different
[2:40:24] they have thus saith the Lord or they
[2:40:32] then
[2:40:33] they will do the works of God
[2:40:39] now those who tell us that we are in the
[2:40:41] bride's Revival let me just ask you this
[2:40:44] question do you see people
[2:40:46] racing up with thus saith the Lord in
[2:40:49] their mouth
[2:40:51] and leading this movement forward very
[2:40:54] few if any
[2:40:58] does that discourage us actually no it
[2:41:01] doesn't discourage me at all
[2:41:04] it reminds me to keep my focus on being
[2:41:06] a part of that group
[2:41:08] instead of part of the other group
[2:41:13] it reminds me not to ever take for
[2:41:16] granted what God did when he restored
[2:41:18] the word
[2:41:19] he didn't restore the word to kill the
[2:41:21] bride
[2:41:22] He restored the word to give the bride
[2:41:25] power and authority right
[2:41:27] then they will do the works of God for
[2:41:30] it is himself in them continuing his
[2:41:34] word to fulfill as he did complete in
[2:41:37] his days
[2:41:38] all things when he was here
[2:41:48] this is not Pentecostal Assembly of God
[2:41:50] Church of God charismatic Doctrine
[2:41:54] this is something a little bigger than
[2:41:55] that
[2:42:00] when he was here he did not complete all
[2:42:03] when he was here
[2:42:08] for it was not time yet
[2:42:12] Jesus
[2:42:14] did all that he was supposed to do in
[2:42:17] his time here
[2:42:19] but there were some things that were
[2:42:21] never completed for it was not yet time
[2:42:25] because we see Jesus as the first fruits
[2:42:29] of the resurrection and the first fruits
[2:42:30] of them who slept I think we can come
[2:42:32] all the way over into our day we see
[2:42:34] brother Branham coming to maturity and
[2:42:37] we can say I believe without any adding
[2:42:39] to the scripture or the word I believe
[2:42:41] we can say that brother Branham did not
[2:42:43] complete all
[2:42:46] when he was here for it was not time yet
[2:42:51] he did everything that he was supposed
[2:42:53] to do in his time
[2:42:55] and the Lord took him
[2:42:57] now God's counting on a bride
[2:43:00] not a return Ministry
[2:43:04] not a tent meeting
[2:43:06] not an airplane
[2:43:09] not trying to decide who's going to
[2:43:11] drive the the four the 18-wheeler around
[2:43:14] who's going to be the manager
[2:43:18] but realizing that the responsibility is
[2:43:21] now in the hands of the Bride
[2:43:25] now as we close
[2:43:27] we've covered foreknowledge
[2:43:30] we've covered predestination and then we
[2:43:33] come to one of the most important stages
[2:43:35] of your Redemption destiny
[2:43:38] and and time will not allow us to go
[2:43:41] into that this morning perhaps an
[2:43:43] attention span
[2:43:45] but let me say that it's one of the most
[2:43:48] important parts of our destiny
[2:43:50] fulfillment and that is because it's
[2:43:52] what makes it connected to you
[2:43:54] it's what connects you to your destiny
[2:43:57] it's calling somebody say calling
[2:44:00] to them he foreknew to them also he did
[2:44:03] predestinate
[2:44:05] to those who are predestinate
[2:44:08] he called
[2:44:10] the calling is when it becomes a reality
[2:44:13] in your personal life
[2:44:17] it's the Damascus call of your life
[2:44:20] it's when God reaches out to you and
[2:44:23] says hey I had a thought about you and I
[2:44:27] wrote a will with you in it and now I
[2:44:29] wanted you to know that
[2:44:33] for some of us it came as small children
[2:44:35] in Sunday school environment
[2:44:38] for others we had lived a majority of
[2:44:40] our life either in sin or religion
[2:44:43] and God had to find us where we were and
[2:44:46] wake us up that he had a purpose in our
[2:44:49] life and Grace
[2:44:51] to help us live out that purpose but it
[2:44:54] was the calling stage that made it
[2:44:57] personal to you
[2:45:00] how many of you have recognized
[2:45:03] that you were foreknown and your your
[2:45:06] your your plan his plan for your life
[2:45:10] was written down by predestination but
[2:45:13] how many of you have recognized that he
[2:45:15] has called you
[2:45:17] let me see your hand
[2:45:20] he's reached you he has found you
[2:45:24] he has identified himself with you and
[2:45:29] once that becomes a reality in your life
[2:45:31] it can change everything if you so
[2:45:34] desire
[2:45:36] because then you want to live in a
[2:45:38] constant place of yieldedness to his
[2:45:41] will and to his plan let's Stand
[2:45:43] Together
[2:46:03] someone asked my wife if there's been a
[2:46:05] update Beyond this update
[2:46:09] she's pushing
[2:46:16] she's nine centimeters at 113.
[2:46:20] so Lydia should be here within the hour
