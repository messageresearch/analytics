[34:45] till tomorrow i tell you just the uh the
[34:47] anointing is so rich
[34:50] so rich
[34:51] i tell you last evening
[34:53] how the lord just come down and
[34:56] and moved among us
[34:58] well maybe he didn't for you but he did
[35:00] for me i thought you might be a little
[35:03] more excited maybe you're still sleepy
[35:04] and tired this morning
[35:06] but he moved for me last night
[35:09] hallelujah i'm so thankful i'm so
[35:11] thankful that he knows exactly where we
[35:13] are brother steve
[35:14] i know he knows the need that we have
[35:17] brother brooks and he comes down and he
[35:19] speaks
[35:20] to each one of us personally to the need
[35:23] that you have
[35:24] you know brother isaiah can't come and
[35:26] know everything that is going on in
[35:28] everybody's lives but my god sure does
[35:31] and he can take a message that can come
[35:33] from one man and speak to hundreds this
[35:36] morning to every individual need and and
[35:40] i
[35:40] well
[35:41] i was going to sing this song but i
[35:42] think i'm going to sing a different song
[35:44] maybe we'll sing the other one in a
[35:45] minute too if it would be the lord's
[35:48] will
[35:50] but as i think of
[35:52] of christ coming to us
[35:54] you know i i there's a song and if y'all
[35:57] have the words to it i'm not a person
[35:58] that likes to sing by myself i like to
[36:00] worship with people and i'm very envious
[36:02] of brother benjamin this morning and how
[36:05] he his voice just continues to go and go
[36:08] and and yeah and i don't have that
[36:10] anymore it seems like
[36:12] it it goes out pretty quick but um if
[36:15] you all have the words to uh he came to
[36:17] me i don't know if y'all have the words
[36:19] you can put it on the screen or not but
[36:21] um
[36:22] you know i was i was thinking about that
[36:24] last evening as he did come to us
[36:28] as he came down and spoke to my heart
[36:31] spoke to your heart i believe and and
[36:33] the thing is is as steve as i looked in
[36:35] the the scripture i see many times that
[36:38] other people would come to him and they
[36:40] would have a need of him and many times
[36:42] they would go away sad
[36:44] but it's a special time
[36:46] when he chose to go to them
[36:49] when he said i have needs to go
[36:51] by samaria
[36:54] he had a need to come by my place
[36:57] he had a need
[36:58] his need was you
[37:00] and that's what drew him the need that
[37:02] you have some people think there's
[37:04] they're too needy in their life and that
[37:06] that pushes people away but it doesn't
[37:08] push him away
[37:10] your need is what attracts him
[37:12] to you this morning and i'm so thankful
[37:15] that the song says
[37:17] he came to me
[37:19] when i could not come to where he was
[37:24] he came to me would you help me sing if
[37:26] they have the words to it um key of c i
[37:29] believe
[37:30] we'll try that
[37:32] the gulf that separates
[37:36] me
[37:38] from christ my lord
[37:45] oh
[37:46] it was so vast
[37:48] the crawl

[44:48] the things that he saw where he thought
[44:50] that he would find him lying dead upon

[1:07:51] i might not be able to tell it
[1:07:53] you can be seated
[1:07:55] i might not be able to tell it
[1:07:58] like it's in my heart just play
[1:07:59] something soft would you
[1:08:01] i this wasn't in my mind
[1:08:03] i wasn't even thinking this when i felt
[1:08:05] the unction of the lord come
[1:08:08] and had i had the strength i believe
[1:08:09] there would have been more that i
[1:08:11] could have yielded to
[1:08:17] let me see the hand of every visitor
[1:08:18] this is not your regular church on
[1:08:20] sunday hold up your hand
[1:08:22] there's a lot of you here
[1:08:25] and you just don't know
[1:08:31] what we saw the enemy do
[1:08:35] some years back and we're not going to
[1:08:36] brag on him he doesn't get any any
[1:08:39] credit does he
[1:08:41] but uh he sent an attack
[1:08:44] against our young people many years ago
[1:08:47] and it was it was hard it was hard for
[1:08:49] everybody
[1:08:51] and we recovered
[1:08:53] by
[1:08:54] survival
[1:08:56] but not really by overcoming
[1:08:58] you know there's a difference
[1:09:00] you can survive and then you can
[1:09:01] overcome
[1:09:03] and then about
[1:09:04] 2014 we as a whole church
[1:09:07] went through the hardest one of the
[1:09:09] hardest trials
[1:09:11] that we have ever gone through as a body
[1:09:13] of believers
[1:09:14] and we lost a lot
[1:09:18] both naturally and more importantly
[1:09:21] spiritually
[1:09:23] and one of the things that we lost
[1:09:25] was our youth choir
[1:09:30] and they sang maybe a few of them are
[1:09:32] different variations but not much
[1:09:35] in all these years
[1:09:37] and i didn't even know i didn't even
[1:09:39] think that i wasn't even thinking on it
[1:09:40] when i felt the inspiration of the lord
[1:09:43] but i felt the lord wanted to speak to
[1:09:45] them and to this body
[1:09:47] and i thought you visitors had a right
[1:09:49] to know
[1:09:50] that they did they only practiced three
[1:09:52] times or something like that
[1:09:54] but what you just saw was the answer to
[1:09:57] a lot of prayers
[1:10:00] a lot of saints here
[1:10:02] have fasted and prayed for our young
[1:10:04] people and prayed that god would make a
[1:10:06] way
[1:10:07] that they would just have the desire
[1:10:09] you can drive them to do something you
[1:10:11] can push them to do something pull them
[1:10:13] to do something
[1:10:14] but the lord has to drop it in at the
[1:10:16] right time
[1:10:17] and god laid that song on megan jovich's
[1:10:20] heart
[1:10:21] and she started doing everything she
[1:10:23] could and sister laurel she asked sister
[1:10:25] laurel to help and different ones and
[1:10:27] the next thing you know they were
[1:10:29] together again
[1:10:31] some of them married now
[1:10:33] some of them with children now some of
[1:10:35] them the next generation
[1:10:39] some of them carrying babies right now
[1:10:41] when they used to be babies but i can't
[1:10:44] tell you how full my heart is right now
[1:10:47] i believe the word of the lord
[1:10:49] i believe that god is restoring
[1:10:51] something
[1:10:53] i believe god is going to do something
[1:10:55] in their lives would you just give god
[1:10:57] praise with us right now
[1:10:59] oh
[1:11:01] jesus
[1:11:04] we pray for every one of them lord
[1:11:07] we lift them up right now in the name of
[1:11:10] jesus that you will indeed keep your
[1:11:14] promise to them lord
[1:11:17] fill them so full of the holy ghost and
[1:11:21] fire
[1:11:25] take from them the desire of this world
[1:11:29] and let them love you only jesus
[1:11:33] hallelujah
[1:11:35] [Applause]
[1:11:37] thank you for giving me that moment
[1:11:40] to tell you what i believe the lord was
[1:11:42] saying
[1:11:47] this has been a time of
[1:11:50] circles and cycles
[1:11:53] and seasons
[1:11:55] and we don't have time this morning
[1:11:57] because we want brother brooks to come
[1:11:59] and
[1:11:59] take all the time he needs
[1:12:02] but some of you would marvel
[1:12:04] if you knew what the lord was doing
[1:12:07] behind the scenes
[1:12:09] just confirming some of those circles
[1:12:12] and cycles and connections and
[1:12:17] we had been talking
[1:12:21] in my home the saints from indiana and
[1:12:23] we were sharing some things that we had
[1:12:25] seen the lord connecting and putting
[1:12:27] together and
[1:12:29] we shared about a particular family
[1:12:33] and they knew the family i knew the
[1:12:35] family they knew the family many years
[1:12:37] ago and we it just made such a beautiful
[1:12:39] connection and
[1:12:40] we started reminiscing and talking about
[1:12:43] some things
[1:12:44] and
[1:12:45] unbeknownst to us
[1:12:47] last night after we went home i'm
[1:12:49] walking in the door and that sister who
[1:12:51] is not here
[1:12:52] not in her home she's visiting way off
[1:12:54] in ohio
[1:12:56] some for some reason she was streaming
[1:12:59] the service last night
[1:13:01] and i don't know if she'd ever streamed
[1:13:02] a service before i don't know she's ever
[1:13:04] streamed a service before
[1:13:06] and she was so blessed
[1:13:08] by seeing the liberty she's actually in
[1:13:11] amish country right now with with
[1:13:13] friends and family and connections
[1:13:15] and she said oh i wish those people that
[1:13:17] are around me here could have the
[1:13:20] freedom
[1:13:21] and the joy that i saw those people
[1:13:24] celebrating and having last night it was
[1:13:27] inspiration to her
[1:13:30] and we marveled
[1:13:32] we marveled in just calling her name we
[1:13:35] marveled that she saw the service and
[1:13:38] reached out and
[1:13:39] it's just things that you can't really
[1:13:41] explain
[1:13:43] but god is doing some beautiful things
[1:13:46] because he's a beautiful god
[1:13:48] and we've been blessed this week
[1:13:51] brother brooks has given his all
[1:13:54] and sister ruby has been so much support
[1:13:57] for him
[1:13:58] i think he is a stronger man
[1:14:02] and more at peace
[1:14:04] when sister ruby is with him
[1:14:07] we have reaped the benefit
[1:14:10] of him having his
[1:14:12] wife precious companion with him here
[1:14:16] it makes a difference doesn't it brother
[1:14:19] and when when i looked up and saw her
[1:14:21] going around this church
[1:14:24] it so touched me
[1:14:28] and i just said lord that's that she's
[1:14:30] like my mama
[1:14:32] would you pour your holy ghost on her
[1:14:36] strengthen her for the journey
[1:14:39] the life of a pastor's wife is a
[1:14:41] difficult life
[1:14:43] with lots of misunderstandings and a lot
[1:14:45] of vicious attacks
[1:14:47] i know because i live with one
[1:14:50] but i'm so thankful that god touched her
[1:14:53] she's given of herself i'm glad that god
[1:14:56] touched her today
[1:14:59] i want you to
[1:15:00] ask the lord what he would have you to
[1:15:02] sow we usually don't do two in one
[1:15:05] service maybe last night we were just
[1:15:07] going to do
[1:15:08] an offering for
[1:15:11] brother brooks and when i realized that
[1:15:13] i hadn't done it i started fretting a
[1:15:15] little bit in the in the flesh
[1:15:17] and i said oh lord please don't let it
[1:15:18] be that i have cheated him
[1:15:21] out of what he would have
[1:15:22] gotten and then i thought that's the
[1:15:25] most carnal thing
[1:15:27] to think even that thought
[1:15:30] i felt like the lord was just saying
[1:15:31] trust me
[1:15:33] so i'm trusting him today
[1:15:36] if you will ask the lord what he would
[1:15:38] have you to give every penny
[1:15:40] every dollar to
[1:15:42] will go directly to brother brooks
[1:15:45] and if you make it out to the church
[1:15:47] then we will of course then write the
[1:15:49] check
[1:15:50] and every
[1:15:51] bit of it every part of it will go
[1:15:54] directly to him you'll be sowing right
[1:15:56] into his ministry
[1:15:58] would you stand again do you feel able
[1:16:02] i'm afraid if i sit down i might not get
[1:16:04] back up
[1:16:06] lord we have been the beneficiaries
[1:16:10] of a great gift that you have given to
[1:16:12] the body of christ
[1:16:14] and
[1:16:16] for three years or more now
[1:16:18] we have feasted at the table that you
[1:16:21] have prepared in him
[1:16:23] and once again this year we have
[1:16:25] really really really enjoyed the
[1:16:28] strength of the word
[1:16:30] it comes with authority
[1:16:33] and more importantly it comes with
[1:16:35] integrity
[1:16:37] and this is what we really admire
[1:16:40] in our brother his ability to get out of
[1:16:43] the way
[1:16:44] and let you use him
[1:16:46] and we admire
[1:16:48] his integrity before you
[1:16:51] so we ask that you would receive this
[1:16:54] offering
[1:16:55] we give it unto you lord
[1:16:58] in the name of your servant
[1:17:00] that their needs might be met that they
[1:17:02] might be blessed
[1:17:04] that they might receive a a double
[1:17:07] reward
[1:17:09] for giving to us and making the
[1:17:10] sacrifice of such a long journey so i
[1:17:13] ask that you bless the gift and the
[1:17:15] giver
[1:17:17] that you multiply this offering in in
[1:17:20] beautiful and witty ways
[1:17:23] so that it even spins larger
[1:17:27] lord i pray that if there's things they
[1:17:29] need to purchase they'll be on sale
[1:17:33] i pray there'll be coupons and discounts
[1:17:37] so that this offering will go farther
[1:17:40] than it would have ever gone
[1:17:43] this is our desire
[1:17:46] we want them blessed
[1:17:49] so we give this in your name
[1:17:52] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:17:55] and for your glory and the saints said

[1:21:09] that you have done in this camp meeting
[1:21:11] our sisters have cooked nearly day and
[1:21:14] night
[1:21:15] so many of them have stepped up and even
[1:21:18] filled in for others who couldn't or
[1:21:19] didn't
[1:21:20] and have really labored
[1:21:24] and the food has been fabulous
[1:21:28] the fellowship even better than the food
[1:21:30] but we don't take that for granted as
[1:21:32] though you owe us something
[1:21:34] we know that you did that unto the lord
[1:21:37] and i want you to know it has been much
[1:21:39] appreciated by everyone who has partook
[1:21:42] and been blessed by it brother and
[1:21:44] sister greeley opened up the basement of
[1:21:46] their home
[1:21:47] for some of our brothers and sisters
[1:21:49] from indiana to stay in and we're so
[1:21:51] thankful for that
[1:21:53] we've had great fellowship with them
[1:21:55] every evening in our home
[1:21:57] spilling out into the yard and the porch
[1:22:00] and the patio because it's not the
[1:22:02] biggest of places to gather but we've
[1:22:04] made it
[1:22:05] and i want you to know it'll be oh there
[1:22:07] she is i thought i was gonna say it'll
[1:22:09] be easier to say with her not being in
[1:22:11] here but i am one of the most blessed
[1:22:14] men in the whole wide world
[1:22:16] because i have one of the greatest wives
[1:22:19] that any man could ever have
[1:22:23] he has so blessed me
[1:22:27] [Applause]
[1:22:30] even though others were cooking and
[1:22:32] providing
[1:22:33] in that last minute
[1:22:36] day and night she would say i'm not sure
[1:22:39] i better go make another pot pie i
[1:22:41] better go make another i better make
[1:22:43] sure
[1:22:44] and this morning when we got up we could
[1:22:46] hardly roll out of bed
[1:22:48] but by the time i got up she made it
[1:22:50] before me
[1:22:51] the kitchen was already spread out with
[1:22:53] food and she was cooking again
[1:22:55] and has opened uh her home i'll say
[1:22:58] because she's the one that does all the
[1:23:00] painting and the fixing she's the repair
[1:23:02] man at our house
[1:23:04] and we have enjoyed it so much i want to

[1:23:41] [Music]
[1:23:57] oh i just so thank god for being here
[1:24:01] most of all i thank god for his presence
[1:24:04] because you can have thousands of people
[1:24:07] and yet
[1:24:08] it can be void of the presence of the
[1:24:09] lord
[1:24:11] but when he comes amen it's a miracle
[1:24:14] and such a blessing and it's uh you know
[1:24:16] it just all it it
[1:24:18] it makes you a junkie you know
[1:24:21] it makes you want more and more and more
[1:24:23] of him
[1:24:25] and uh you know we just thank the lord
[1:24:27] for
[1:24:29] brother shelley and his wife

[1:24:35] you know i i just love it when my wife
[1:24:38] clicks with another sister
[1:24:42] and they're clicking
[1:24:46] [Music]
[1:24:47] i get so excited because you know as
[1:24:50] they say um
[1:24:52] many of the uh
[1:24:55] pastors wives they don't have too many
[1:24:57] friends
[1:24:58] and and i don't know why that is the way
[1:25:01] it is but it is
[1:25:03] but i thank god for i don't know all the
[1:25:06] pastor's wives
[1:25:07] especially for mine and he's correct i'm
[1:25:10] a better man when she's here
[1:25:12] [Music]
[1:25:14] amen so i thank god for my wife and
[1:25:17] you don't know what the sacrifice is for
[1:25:19] her
[1:25:20] because she's she's has been in the past
[1:25:23] terrified of flying
[1:25:26] but i know her love for me and her faith
[1:25:29] in god brought her here
[1:25:31] yes sir that's right too
[1:25:33] you're right about that
[1:25:35] she couldn't hardly wait to see brother
[1:25:37] shelley
[1:25:38] so we thank god you know she used to
[1:25:40] make me jealous long time ago because
[1:25:42] she was listening to more of his singing
[1:25:44] than mine
[1:25:48] and i'm not easily a man that easily get
[1:25:50] jealous but i i'm like come on now you
[1:25:53] like it singing better than mine
[1:25:56] don't answer that okay
[1:25:59] but by the
[1:26:00] it's okay
[1:26:02] it's true it's true she does but it's
[1:26:05] okay
[1:26:06] god is so good to us we thank god for
[1:26:09] all the musicians and
[1:26:11] and i want to say one more thing uh to
[1:26:13] the choir
[1:26:14] i i'm overwhelmed
[1:26:16] uh i love young people
[1:26:18] young people has been my project as well
[1:26:21] and i i love to see them when they
[1:26:24] you know come and participate
[1:26:27] you know in the course of the
[1:26:29] uh ministry there in uh des moines and
[1:26:31] in iowa city we've been trying to get a
[1:26:33] group together but it's very difficult
[1:26:36] for them to come together but when you
[1:26:38] do have them come together
[1:26:41] it's just a blessing
[1:26:43] i believe the strength of the church is
[1:26:44] the young people
[1:26:46] and i always emphasize to the church in
[1:26:49] iowa city
[1:26:50] to the elders

[1:26:55] that would make them want it
[1:26:59] you give them a dead religion or dead
[1:27:02] service they're not going to want it
[1:27:05] because satan has more exciting things
[1:27:08] to give
[1:27:09] and so we know we're in a battle so i
[1:27:12] don't want to spend my time just talking
[1:27:13] about those things but i thank god for
[1:27:15] you young people i i want to encourage

[1:37:27] it makes him know yes sir the battle
[1:37:30] ain't over yet
[1:37:34] and i love it the way god did it you
[1:37:35] knew he took a woman
[1:37:38] the bride of christ
[1:37:42] to beat the devil with
[1:37:45] it's like a man in his house and a man
[1:37:47] outside boasting and telling how he's
[1:37:49] going to beat him
[1:37:51] he says hon go out there that's my light
[1:37:53] work
[1:37:59] it's
[1:38:00] humiliating
[1:38:02] when you see a woman get beat up a man
[1:38:04] get beat up by a woman
[1:38:07] and i
[1:38:08] i've seen it happen
[1:38:13] [Music]
[1:38:14] fort jackson south carolina
[1:38:18] on the military base
[1:38:20] i saw a woman
[1:38:22] be the man both of them were sergeant i
[1:38:25] don't know which one of them got
[1:38:26] court-martialed
[1:38:29] but the lady was the sister was she she
[1:38:31] was saying don't don't don't do that
[1:38:32] don't do that and he kept going
[1:38:35] and i think he threw the first point
[1:38:36] punch
[1:38:38] and she beat him
[1:38:42] personally i would have went awol
[1:38:47] i'll never forget it i was just a boy
[1:38:50] and you could tell she had she either
[1:38:52] studied or she had some brothers
[1:38:57] because she put it on him and i don't
[1:38:58] know how he went back to his platoon i
[1:39:01] don't know
[1:39:02] but as we stand every time i think about
[1:39:05] that i think about the bride of christ
[1:39:07] whipping the devil
[1:39:12] [Music]
[1:39:14] hallelujah as we stand
[1:39:17] let us turn to proverbs 3 please
[1:39:26] so good seeing my brother dwayne and
[1:39:29] he still got it
[1:39:32] we thank god for the songs
[1:39:36] it's been so many years since i've seen
[1:39:38] him you know but it's always good to see
[1:39:41] people you haven't seen in a long time
[1:39:43] i i get i get really teared up
[1:39:46] and the reason being is because so many
[1:39:48] has fallen away
[1:39:51] and you know i unite with anybody that
[1:39:53] really fight with jesus
[1:39:55] and stands for jesus
[1:39:57] you know i i know people have their
[1:39:59] issues but i don't care what
[1:40:01] denomination they belong with and belong
[1:40:04] to
[1:40:04] when they name the name of jesus
[1:40:07] they get my attention
[1:40:10] because i was once there
[1:40:13] but because i was there did not change
[1:40:15] who i am now
[1:40:18] i am who i was there
[1:40:21] right
[1:40:22] so you got to understand we make our
[1:40:24] transitions but the transitions doesn't
[1:40:26] change who we are
[1:40:28] because we were bribed before the
[1:40:30] foundation of the world
[1:40:32] and uh you know i always ask people i
[1:40:35] said you know
[1:40:36] let me read the scripture first i
[1:40:38] apologize but you know i tell people i
[1:40:40] said you know
[1:40:41] they always talking about the prophet of
[1:40:43] god i said well where was the prophet
[1:40:45] when he received the holy ghost
[1:40:47] what church he was going to
[1:40:50] that's all i'm saying
[1:40:52] it doesn't matter where the eagle is
[1:40:54] born
[1:40:56] he'll be born under dog
[1:40:58] as long as they present the right
[1:40:59] atmosphere
[1:41:01] the egg will hatch
[1:41:03] that's what your prophecy is
[1:41:05] so anyway it's the truth
[1:41:07] but i appreciate the lord jesus and his
[1:41:09] his grace toward me and his grace toward
[1:41:12] the people of god and and um i keep
[1:41:15] telling people you know it's amazing
[1:41:16] because i they look at me like i'm crazy
[1:41:18] i said what basically do you want me to
[1:41:20] stop everything i'm doing no no no no do
[1:41:22] what you're doing
[1:41:24] but there's something that you must do
[1:41:27] in order for this translation to occur
[1:41:31] i love that song he's resurrecting me
[1:41:34] he he robbed the graves
[1:41:38] and uh he's there's a resurrection going
[1:41:40] on me
[1:41:41] and i trust that everybody be able to
[1:41:43] see
[1:41:45] happening within me
[1:41:47] proverbs 3.
[1:41:50] we're going to read the fifth verse
[1:41:53] trust
[1:41:54] in the lord
[1:41:56] with all thine heart

[1:42:43] and lord i know there are those that

[1:42:47] feel like there could be some more
[1:42:49] changes
[1:42:50] and father there's nothing that i can do
[1:42:52] but i know that you're still the god
[1:42:55] amen of all creation
[1:42:57] and father we pray that you create in us
[1:43:01] a clean heart
[1:43:03] creating us lord

[1:43:10] yourself
[1:43:12] bless us now in jesus christ's name we
[1:43:14] pray amen you may be seated i know we've
[1:43:17] come and i'm some of us are tired and
[1:43:20] you know and but but i trust by god
[1:43:22] grace that god will give us enough
[1:43:23] energy to just hear the word of god
[1:43:26] this morning
[1:43:28] you and i must understand that we're
[1:43:29] living in a time and and we've seen the
[1:43:32] anointing and my was it wonderful uh
[1:43:35] the days ahead before and it is now this
[1:43:38] morning
[1:43:39] but something came to my mind something
[1:43:41] came to my mind and i began to think
[1:43:44] about the anointing and how
[1:43:46] you know the rain fall right
[1:43:49] and and you know i remember when i was a
[1:43:51] little boy uh walking in the rain it was
[1:43:53] wonderful back in the day you can you
[1:43:55] the rain was you could appreciate it you
[1:43:58] didn't have to worry about catching some
[1:43:59] kind of disease
[1:44:02] but now they because of the pollution
[1:44:03] and things like that you don't know
[1:44:05] what's falling on your head
[1:44:07] but nevertheless i can remember the time
[1:44:09] when
[1:44:10] and i love rain to this day i love to
[1:44:12] play in the rain i love to play in the
[1:44:13] water and my grandkids like that they
[1:44:16] love rain they love water they love
[1:44:18] pools and you know and things of that
[1:44:19] nature but the thing that that really
[1:44:22] would get me sometimes you know and i
[1:44:23] know all kids do it
[1:44:25] especially on a nice summer day or
[1:44:27] somewhere where it's raining the rain is
[1:44:29] falling and you say get out of that rain
[1:44:32] but before they get out of the rain they
[1:44:34] do this
[1:44:38] they don't want the rain just on the
[1:44:40] outside
[1:44:42] they want it on the inside
[1:44:44] and so when i was thinking about that
[1:44:46] this morning i said lord i don't want
[1:44:48] the anointing of your anointing just to
[1:44:50] fall on the outside
[1:44:53] i want that anointing on the inside
[1:44:57] and when i began to think about that
[1:44:59] anointing i thought about the ark of the
[1:45:02] covenant and i thought about all of the
[1:45:04] instruments in the ark of the covenant
[1:45:06] was anointed
[1:45:08] and that occurred a covenant that
[1:45:10] represented you and i
[1:45:12] it was a replica of the human
[1:45:15] um body or man
[1:45:17] and everything in us is supposed to be
[1:45:21] anointed
[1:45:23] did you understand that
[1:45:24] then i saw where brother branham was
[1:45:26] talking about the blood of jesus christ
[1:45:29] and he said the blood of jesus christ he
[1:45:31] said the blood
[1:45:33] was anointed
[1:45:36] and he said that anointing represents
[1:45:39] christ
[1:45:40] so therefore jesus's blood had the
[1:45:43] spirit of christ in it
[1:45:45] hallelujah now if god did it for him he
[1:45:49] can do it for us
[1:45:51] you see because the holy ghost when it
[1:45:53] comes it's not only supposed to anoint
[1:45:55] your spirit and anoint your body but
[1:45:58] it's supposed to anoint your soul
[1:46:01] and when that life comes in you it
[1:46:04] anoints your blood
[1:46:08] hallelujah what are you talking about
[1:46:09] brother brooks with the anointing of god
[1:46:12] on the inside amen we have how could i
[1:46:16] say it we have an advantage of the devil
[1:46:20] because the devil has to come in in
[1:46:22] order to
[1:46:24] fl afflict us
[1:46:26] but when we got the blood when we got
[1:46:29] the anointing on the inside it will
[1:46:32] fight for us
[1:46:34] you hear what i'm saying it is the thing
[1:46:37] that causes everything that's perverted
[1:46:40] to be kicked out
[1:46:42] it's kind of like the white blood cells
[1:46:44] right they're there as an army to
[1:46:47] protect us from all germs
[1:46:52] hallelujah i normally don't get hoarse
[1:46:56] but uh we're gonna keep going
[1:47:02] god is good to us
[1:47:04] when we think about
[1:47:07] being anointed
[1:47:09] i i told the lord i said you know
[1:47:12] they poured oil
[1:47:15] on david's head
[1:47:18] and they poured oil on aaron's head and
[1:47:21] and the bible said when the oil ran down
[1:47:23] from his head all the way down
[1:47:25] to his feet so he was totally anointed
[1:47:29] on the outside
[1:47:31] hallelujah but that same oil
[1:47:34] is to be anointed is to be poured
[1:47:36] on the inside
[1:47:38] you say what do you mean because
[1:47:40] the uh the vessels in the hole in the in
[1:47:43] the temple of god was anointed i want my
[1:47:47] eyes to be anointed
[1:47:49] i want my brain to be anointed i want my
[1:47:52] heart to be anointed i want every
[1:47:54] instrument in my body to be anointed
[1:47:58] hallelujah
[1:47:59] so much so that when god says change
[1:48:02] i'll change
[1:48:04] god is so good to us
[1:48:06] when we talk about and this is where i
[1:48:09] believe the lord is speaking to my heart
[1:48:13] and he spoke
[1:48:14] that we need to trust him
[1:48:18] trust him
[1:48:19] more
[1:48:22] as long as you worry
[1:48:24] you don't trust him
[1:48:28] because worry is the absence of trust
[1:48:32] and whenever you worry
[1:48:34] you're not trusting him i'll say it
[1:48:36] again
[1:48:38] no matter what comes your way the bible
[1:48:41] says in all things give what thanks
[1:48:45] if you want to keep yourself he says
[1:48:48] lord i need to be more consecrated
[1:48:51] and when we say consecration we said
[1:48:53] lord i want to be more dedicated
[1:48:56] i want to be more devoted i want to be
[1:48:59] more faithful
[1:49:00] but we're being
[1:49:02] more dedicated more faithful and more
[1:49:04] devoted amen to what the word you've
[1:49:08] heard me say throughout the meaning
[1:49:10] meeting i am a worshiper of the word
[1:49:15] and whatever the word says
[1:49:17] that i'll humble myself to
[1:49:19] because in the beginning was the word
[1:49:21] the word with god and the word was god
[1:49:25] hallelujah
[1:49:26] but we must learn how to trust god with
[1:49:29] all
[1:49:31] allah of our hearts not some of it all
[1:49:34] of it
[1:49:35] and it comes by trial sometimes you
[1:49:38] don't even know where you stand when it
[1:49:40] comes to god but god will allow trials
[1:49:43] to come to see where you stand so that
[1:49:46] you can see where you stand
[1:49:49] is that right and when those trials come
[1:49:52] amen then you'll be able to see am i
[1:49:55] trusting god
[1:49:57] because the moment you stress
[1:50:00] you're not trusting
[1:50:02] god did not cause us to stress stress
[1:50:05] works against your body that's why so
[1:50:08] many people are sick because of stress
[1:50:11] we were not designed to be stressful we
[1:50:14] are designed a man to rest in god
[1:50:20] hallelujah and i believe that on this
[1:50:23] oncoming storm and i don't know whether
[1:50:25] you see it or not but it's coming
[1:50:28] and many hearts will faint and fail
[1:50:31] because of fear
[1:50:33] when you fear
[1:50:36] you're not trusting god
[1:50:41] when you see the things coming upon the
[1:50:43] earth
[1:50:44] you're not trusting god now i'm not
[1:50:47] trying to say that the devil doesn't
[1:50:49] present fear
[1:50:51] but the bible said perfect love casts
[1:50:53] out fear
[1:50:55] you understand me so when these fears
[1:50:57] comes upon you you must understand that
[1:51:00] the perfect love casts it out
[1:51:03] i often wondered what that was
[1:51:08] until i had an experience
[1:51:10] and i don't know whether i was here the
[1:51:11] last time when i talked about the
[1:51:13] american airline
[1:51:14] but i was on that plane
[1:51:17] and that plane they said was getting
[1:51:19] ready or they tried to say it in a nice
[1:51:21] way but
[1:51:22] they didn't want to say we're getting
[1:51:23] ready to crash
[1:51:25] but they basically said we're losing
[1:51:27] altitude
[1:51:29] and uh
[1:51:31] the uh the the airline stewardess was
[1:51:34] very very nervous
[1:51:36] but i was reading a spoken word book and
[1:51:38] i was just praying and having a good
[1:51:39] time and and she came back and she saw
[1:51:42] something i didn't see
[1:51:43] and she kept
[1:51:45] talking to another man and she come back
[1:51:46] to me and she says what is that
[1:51:48] and i don't know what she was talking
[1:51:49] about but she was pointing to something
[1:51:50] above my head and she said she went away
[1:51:52] and she came again she said i see a she
[1:51:55] started to say light but she caught
[1:51:57] herself
[1:51:58] and then she came back again
[1:52:00] and she said you're different
[1:52:05] you're different
[1:52:07] now this was before
[1:52:09] they announced we were getting ready to
[1:52:11] crash
[1:52:12] right
[1:52:14] so anyway i'm looking at this thing and
[1:52:16] i'm just looking at this woman and and
[1:52:18] and then all of a sudden she goes back
[1:52:20] this way and she comes back again and
[1:52:21] she says everybody buckle up and
[1:52:24] you know she started going through her
[1:52:26] her drama trying not to be afraid but
[1:52:28] she was terrified
[1:52:31] and she kept looking at me and i just
[1:52:33] well
[1:52:35] i knew something was going to happen
[1:52:36] before we started out
[1:52:38] because it wasn't working right in the
[1:52:40] beginning
[1:52:41] and i thought to myself just as soon as
[1:52:43] we get up there
[1:52:44] this thing is going to fall or faint
[1:52:48] and it happened i did not speak it but
[1:52:50] it did happen i'm just sharing
[1:52:53] how perfect love casts out fear
[1:52:55] i'm sharing
[1:52:57] because here it was i'm looking this is
[1:52:59] the winter time i'm looking outside of
[1:53:02] the the the the window and all i could
[1:53:05] see was snow and ice
[1:53:08] and somebody said well where's where are
[1:53:10] we going to land
[1:53:12] and she says i don't know the pilot
[1:53:14] knows
[1:53:19] and everybody's imagination went wild
[1:53:23] you could tell because everybody got
[1:53:25] quiet
[1:53:28] and i thought i'm gonna tell you
[1:53:29] something all of a sudden a fear
[1:53:34] jumped on me
[1:53:34] [Music]
[1:53:36] i could hardly breathe
[1:53:39] and i said oh god you didn't tell me i
[1:53:41] was going to die today
[1:53:45] that's exactly what i said
[1:53:47] you didn't tell me i was going to die
[1:53:49] today
[1:53:50] then all of a sudden as i said that
[1:53:52] something just snatched that fear out of
[1:53:54] me
[1:53:56] and i heard him say perfect love
[1:53:59] cast out fear
[1:54:02] see it wasn't me
[1:54:04] it was the perfect love that made it
[1:54:07] move
[1:54:08] you understand what i'm saying
[1:54:10] it's like when the prophet of god
[1:54:12] crossed that man's fence
[1:54:14] and the ball was out there he forgot
[1:54:17] he reached for his gun and his gun
[1:54:19] wasn't there
[1:54:21] what was their fear
[1:54:24] hallelujah he said but then something
[1:54:27] happened
[1:54:29] somebody helped me here
[1:54:32] something happened and perfect love
[1:54:34] stepped in
[1:54:37] and directed every move from that point
[1:54:40] on
[1:54:41] and after it was all over he said i wish
[1:54:44] i could stay there
[1:54:46] i wish i could be in that kind of
[1:54:49] anointing forever these are these are
[1:54:52] paraphrased words but that's what he was
[1:54:53] saying because it was such an anointing
[1:54:56] and he understood it was not him
[1:55:00] same things with the bees is that right
[1:55:02] same thing he could have been stung to
[1:55:04] death but all of a sudden perfect love
[1:55:07] stuff
[1:55:08] see perfect love is not just a thing
[1:55:10] it's a person
[1:55:12] it's christ jesus it's the mighty angel
[1:55:15] of god standing on your in on your
[1:55:19] behalf
[1:55:22] hallelujah
[1:55:23] [Music]
[1:55:25] but you see that also comes for being
[1:55:27] dedicated
[1:55:29] if you're faithful to god he will be
[1:55:31] faithful to you
[1:55:33] so let me move on by god's grace
[1:55:35] you and i must understand that we have a
[1:55:37] purpose
[1:55:39] now our purpose is
[1:55:41] to prove
[1:55:42] that malachi 4
[1:55:45] was right
[1:55:47] because malachi 4 wasn't just a man
[1:55:50] it was god in the man
[1:55:52] right y'all understand me it was the
[1:55:54] visitation of the son of man and these
[1:55:57] son of man came to do what prepare us
[1:56:00] for a rapture
[1:56:02] hallelujah
[1:56:04] but one thing for certain we must come
[1:56:06] to a place amen that we trust god i'm
[1:56:10] telling you
[1:56:11] perfect faith is the faith of jesus
[1:56:14] christ
[1:56:15] perfect faith is undisturbed faith
[1:56:19] whenever the devil comes it you move
[1:56:21] that's why paul said
[1:56:23] nothing moves me
[1:56:26] because paul had entered into a perfect
[1:56:29] faith
[1:56:30] and i look at the the seven church ages
[1:56:33] and we've come through that and people
[1:56:34] say oh what what you know and i saw that
[1:56:37] in that church age was it was the regime
[1:56:39] the original seed
[1:56:41] that was really planted
[1:56:43] that means that all of the gifts
[1:56:46] amen it was in the ephesus age
[1:56:49] everything
[1:56:50] but why couldn't they make a rapture
[1:56:54] because you have not come yet
[1:56:57] hallelujah and each one even though they
[1:57:00] had all of those gifts they had the
[1:57:02] seven virtues otherwise the gospel
[1:57:05] that's being preached to us
[1:57:06] it's not equal to what they were being
[1:57:08] preached but we they had and it's what
[1:57:12] what they had has now been restored but
[1:57:15] it doesn't stop there with brethren
[1:57:17] kindness it must move on up into divine
[1:57:21] love which is the headstone but in order
[1:57:24] for us to get there we must learn how to
[1:57:28] trust god
[1:57:31] i'm not going to be long
[1:57:33] so i hope you get on this train
[1:57:36] i'm not going to be long but the thing
[1:57:38] that i'm the thing that i i'm using is
[1:57:41] the prophet's life just for an example
[1:57:44] because when he was there in the in the
[1:57:45] mountains
[1:57:47] and the snowstorm came right
[1:57:50] and he had already told the other
[1:57:51] brothers y'all get down quick because
[1:57:53] when this blizzard strikes he said you
[1:57:55] know in moments time if you don't know
[1:57:58] what you're doing you're going to die
[1:58:00] hallelujah but at the time he started
[1:58:03] walking
[1:58:05] happened
[1:58:07] a voice spoke to him and said turn
[1:58:09] around
[1:58:12] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:58:14] how many of you would have turned around
[1:58:17] how many of you would have said that
[1:58:18] must be the devil
[1:58:21] but he heard the voice of god
[1:58:24] telling him to turn around
[1:58:27] you understand
[1:58:28] god
[1:58:29] purposed the storm
[1:58:31] and purposed him to be in the stone
[1:58:35] why because he needed a voice
[1:58:38] to stop the storm
[1:58:42] you see what i'm saying you say well
[1:58:44] what do you mean every storm you go
[1:58:46] through god purposed that storm
[1:58:50] but he puts you in the storm to stop the
[1:58:53] stone
[1:58:54] you must understand the power of the
[1:58:57] spoken word in the true believer
[1:59:01] it's no more than god himself speaking
[1:59:04] through you
[1:59:06] oh yes it is
[1:59:10] i was thinking uh
[1:59:12] the other day let me tell you something
[1:59:14] if if if this whole church would have
[1:59:16] really had faith like we should have had
[1:59:19] there wouldn't have been one person
[1:59:21] leaving out here
[1:59:23] undone
[1:59:26] one thing that jesus taught us
[1:59:28] is that
[1:59:29] when we're having prayer services he
[1:59:31] said basically
[1:59:33] especially when it's serious
[1:59:36] let the let those who don't believe you
[1:59:39] can leave
[1:59:42] is that right
[1:59:43] because they hinder
[1:59:45] the faith of god the people of god in
[1:59:47] their faith
[1:59:49] and i don't know whether you can feel it
[1:59:51] but there are times we're praying for
[1:59:53] people and as soon as somebody come up
[1:59:55] their visual that looks like it's
[1:59:57] difficult to do you can feel the
[1:59:59] unbelief
[2:00:01] it's like a wave of unbelief comes
[2:00:03] through the church
[2:00:04] and and you don't even know you're
[2:00:06] hindering
[2:00:09] the move of god because first of all you
[2:00:11] don't believe he can do it
[2:00:14] but i'm here today to tell you that god
[2:00:16] can do anything
[2:00:18] but fail
[2:00:20] i've seen him i've seen god raise the
[2:00:22] dead twice
[2:00:24] nobody can take that from me
[2:00:29] in this message
[2:00:30] i've seen him do it twice
[2:00:37] because he's god
[2:00:38] and if he says i'm the resurrection
[2:00:40] that's what he means
[2:00:45] seeing god even gets psyched to the
[2:00:47] blind
[2:00:49] yes
[2:00:50] see that's what people oh brother
[2:00:52] brandon was the only one that can do
[2:00:53] that that's nonsense
[2:00:57] we have a bride
[2:00:59] we have a people that god has ordained
[2:01:02] to be born of his bone flesh of his
[2:01:05] flesh amen to be just like him
[2:01:09] i believe it
[2:01:11] i believe that there's a marriage going
[2:01:13] on
[2:01:14] there's a union going on between the
[2:01:16] bride of christ and and the bridegroom
[2:01:20] hallelujah it's time to move from the
[2:01:23] bride stage into the stage of the wife
[2:01:27] [Music]
[2:01:29] is that right
[2:01:31] it's time people need to understand that
[2:01:33] you're joining us with christ but you
[2:01:36] got to trust the word
[2:01:39] see trusting the word is trusting god
[2:01:43] because god is the word
[2:01:46] hallelujah
[2:01:48] you love the lord
[2:01:52] the bible tells us
[2:01:54] amen that we are seed of promise do you
[2:01:56] know what that means
[2:01:58] that god promised you would be here
[2:02:02] is that right
[2:02:03] he promised
[2:02:04] jesus was going to be here
[2:02:06] he promised john would be here
[2:02:09] is that right he promised mary would be
[2:02:13] here did he keep his promise
[2:02:15] he kept his promise and he promised that
[2:02:18] in this last day there'll be a bride
[2:02:22] hallelujah
[2:02:23] and we are here
[2:02:26] amen amen
[2:02:30] hallelujah god is good to us
[2:02:34] he's better to us than we've been to
[2:02:35] ourselves
[2:02:37] hallelujah
[2:02:41] well i can feel like some i can see that
[2:02:43] somebody's lost something i should be
[2:02:46] the most tired person in here
[2:02:50] but when it comes to god
[2:02:52] all i need is just one touch
[2:02:56] hallelujah
[2:02:57] now
[2:02:58] we must understand we've never come this
[2:03:01] way before
[2:03:03] even though the scene of sodom is here
[2:03:05] even though the days of noah's here
[2:03:08] those are conditions that god said the
[2:03:10] son of man would be revealed and he also
[2:03:12] tells a story how a bride will be be
[2:03:15] seen
[2:03:17] is that right
[2:03:18] because i'm going to tell you something
[2:03:20] what we must understand if the first
[2:03:22] adam had a feminine
[2:03:24] spirit in him the second one did too
[2:03:27] there was a bride
[2:03:28] and the prophet of god says that when
[2:03:30] let's let's use let's use uh abraham
[2:03:33] when abraham was put to into a deep
[2:03:35] sleep
[2:03:36] and brother brandon talks about that
[2:03:38] deep sleep he said that was like death
[2:03:40] right so god took that same kind of deep
[2:03:43] sleep in genesis and put adam to sleep
[2:03:46] and that was a type of the death but
[2:03:49] then after that death came
[2:03:51] miss eve now she wasn't eve she was adam
[2:03:55] she had the same authority she had the
[2:03:57] same uh headship if i can say it like
[2:04:00] that hallelujah because her headship was
[2:04:04] adam
[2:04:06] and they worked together
[2:04:09] did they not they work together
[2:04:12] hallelujah and this is what god is
[2:04:14] trying to get his bride to see
[2:04:17] he wants to work with you
[2:04:22] hallelujah and we must understand we
[2:04:24] cannot count down
[2:04:26] because of our little infirmities in the
[2:04:28] flesh
[2:04:29] the bible says these afflictions are
[2:04:32] light afflictions
[2:04:36] we must understand we must stand up rise
[2:04:39] from the dust
[2:04:40] whatever whatever was necessary we've
[2:04:42] gotta you know you know roll our
[2:04:44] shoulders back and be what we supposed
[2:04:46] to be
[2:04:47] hallelujah we can't be all coward like
[2:04:49] like it was when david got ready to
[2:04:51] fight the giant amen all of his brothers
[2:04:53] huddled in the corner scared of the
[2:04:56] giants scared of the challenge afraid of
[2:04:59] the challenge
[2:05:00] and he was a young boy
[2:05:02] who had experiences
[2:05:04] who had testimonies what god had already
[2:05:08] done for him he knew that the same god
[2:05:10] that killed the lion the same god that
[2:05:13] killed the bear is the able to kill the
[2:05:15] giant
[2:05:18] hallelujah and i know he's able
[2:05:21] oh yes he is i know he's able
[2:05:26] and as god pulled miss adam out amen
[2:05:30] they were they were twain
[2:05:32] and as i said i think uh earlier in the
[2:05:34] messages amen when god when adam uh uh
[2:05:37] saw uh adam uh what did he do
[2:05:41] with the open word he began to he began
[2:05:43] to tell who tell her who she was
[2:05:46] and when the seals were open that was
[2:05:49] the second adam
[2:05:50] telling amen his bride who she is
[2:05:55] hallelujah bone of my bone
[2:05:58] flesh of my flesh in other words when i
[2:06:00] was created you were there
[2:06:03] hallelujah made out of the same
[2:06:05] substance
[2:06:07] hallelujah and one thing i want us to
[2:06:10] understand until this bible amen becomes
[2:06:14] yours yo absolute
[2:06:17] it must be your resting place it must be
[2:06:20] your rock hallelujah it must be your
[2:06:23] revelation of who god is and once you
[2:06:26] see who god is you'll see who you are
[2:06:30] i don't believe i'm just an animal
[2:06:35] hallelujah
[2:06:36] and no matter what you think
[2:06:39] there is not one superior race
[2:06:42] there's only one superior race and
[2:06:43] that's the race of jesus christ
[2:06:45] hallelujah it doesn't matter amen how
[2:06:49] you look from the outside it's not the
[2:06:52] outside that god is concerned about it's
[2:06:54] the inside
[2:06:58] y'all understand me
[2:07:04] what was the holies of holies
[2:07:06] that veil was badger skin
[2:07:08] badger skin
[2:07:11] badger skin
[2:07:15] bad
[2:07:17] your skin
[2:07:23] and what we must understand none of us
[2:07:25] been good
[2:07:28] none of us are righteous
[2:07:30] and as long as you in this flesh you
[2:07:32] never will be
[2:07:34] it's not the outward thing that god's
[2:07:36] concerned you're being built from the
[2:07:38] inside out
[2:07:40] this flesh has already been judged
[2:07:45] yes
[2:07:46] you don't never satisfy it
[2:07:49] is that the truth
[2:07:50] oh it's the truth
[2:07:52] and you and i must understand by god's
[2:07:54] grace that's not that should not be our
[2:07:57] attention the attention and the focus
[2:08:00] that we must have must be the inside the
[2:08:03] inner man what's happening with him is
[2:08:06] he growing is he maturing is he coming
[2:08:09] more into the image of god what's
[2:08:11] happening here
[2:08:13] if you're the same that you the way you
[2:08:15] were last year that means you're not
[2:08:17] growing
[2:08:19] and if you're not growing unbelief is
[2:08:21] somewhere
[2:08:22] you understand me unbelief here's the
[2:08:25] growth of the believer
[2:08:28] hallelujah so you say what
[2:08:30] it's so amazing
[2:08:32] how we can all say amen
[2:08:34] when i talk about david amen
[2:08:36] hallelujah and then when your challenges
[2:08:38] come
[2:08:41] hallelujah let me tell you something
[2:08:43] david understood one thing
[2:08:44] he could not do it without the anointing
[2:08:49] and though he was a boy and though he
[2:08:51] was young
[2:08:53] maybe not so mature as he should be
[2:08:56] he understood he still was a king
[2:08:58] that's all i'm saying
[2:09:00] you may not be the matured christian you
[2:09:02] want to be but you must understand
[2:09:04] you're still pride you're still the word
[2:09:07] nothing can change that you are the word
[2:09:13] hallelujah
[2:09:15] give me a little more time
[2:09:17] she's just saying this saying this is a
[2:09:19] new creation
[2:09:21] yes yes it's a new creation yes and he
[2:09:24] and he goes on to say this in the layout
[2:09:26] and scenes he says but now he is
[2:09:27] standing in the midst of the church
[2:09:30] as he stands there revealing who he is
[2:09:34] in the last age now you got to
[2:09:36] understand what he's saying revealing
[2:09:39] who he is
[2:09:40] you understand me have you anybody seen
[2:09:42] jesus
[2:09:44] see all y'all quiet
[2:09:46] only because you don't have that
[2:09:48] revelation you should
[2:09:49] the reason why i say that because i have
[2:09:52] and when i look at you i see him
[2:09:57] see that is the new creation
[2:09:59] god in you
[2:10:02] somebody help me
[2:10:04] it's god in you
[2:10:06] this is the hidden mystery of the seal
[2:10:08] god in a multi-million
[2:10:11] member body
[2:10:13] hallelujah that he called miss jesus
[2:10:16] christ
[2:10:18] amen
[2:10:19] when i see you
[2:10:21] i see him
[2:10:24] that's the way it's supposed to be
[2:10:27] hallelujah
[2:10:28] see it's this is another creation this
[2:10:31] has to do with the church
[2:10:35] but what
[2:10:36] about that layer to see it but you
[2:10:37] understand there was something else took
[2:10:40] place
[2:10:41] after vasti was thrown away or cast out
[2:10:44] there was another one god chose
[2:10:47] and her name was odessa
[2:10:50] hallelujah
[2:10:52] after a while she became what esther
[2:10:55] i love esther
[2:10:57] when i meet her i'm gonna tell i
[2:10:58] preached on a lot
[2:11:01] hallelujah i'm gonna tell after you was
[2:11:04] my inspiration
[2:11:06] hallelujah you came from nowhere
[2:11:09] and became queen
[2:11:11] hallelujah
[2:11:13] that's the way it is with us we come
[2:11:15] from nowhere
[2:11:17] some of us were on street corners some
[2:11:20] of us were in drug houses some of us
[2:11:22] amen was smoking cracking whatever more
[2:11:26] came from nowhere
[2:11:28] but now we're sitting in the throne
[2:11:30] we've been invited to be queen of heaven
[2:11:37] [Applause]
[2:11:38] the devil don't like it
[2:11:41] why because he didn't get a second
[2:11:43] chance hallelujah he doesn't understand
[2:11:46] grace because the more we fall the more
[2:11:50] grace is given
[2:11:52] [Applause]
[2:11:55] hallelujah
[2:11:56] and i'm going to tell you something i'm
[2:11:58] going to use every bit of it that i have
[2:12:02] i want his grace i want his mercy i want
[2:12:05] his love
[2:12:06] i want everything
[2:12:13] that he's got to offer
[2:12:15] hallelujah
[2:12:18] [Music]
[2:12:22] this is another creation
[2:12:24] hallelujah he can't stand it
[2:12:26] he hates it
[2:12:28] hallelujah because he knows
[2:12:30] that the word of god cannot come back
[2:12:32] void
[2:12:33] hallelujah
[2:12:34] yes sir
[2:12:36] he tried everything
[2:12:38] to get rid of samson
[2:12:40] is that right
[2:12:41] he took his testimony for a while is
[2:12:44] that right
[2:12:46] samson was a mighty mighty man available
[2:12:49] he whipped those philistines from east
[2:12:51] to west
[2:12:52] hallelujah but he allowed the world to
[2:12:55] get in between his relationship in god
[2:13:00] nothing's wrong with the word
[2:13:02] it's when you allow
[2:13:04] the world to get in between
[2:13:06] you and the word
[2:13:08] that's when god can't be effective as he
[2:13:11] should in your life but if you kill the
[2:13:15] philistine if you kill the delilah in
[2:13:19] your life you'll see that your strength
[2:13:21] will be restored
[2:13:23] i love it
[2:13:24] yeah i love it because the prophet god
[2:13:27] said like this he said he said uh
[2:13:30] uh he was in bad shape
[2:13:33] samson he said but there's a possibility
[2:13:37] oh maybe there's a possibility
[2:13:39] maybe there's a possibility that god
[2:13:41] would give me a revival but maybe
[2:13:43] there's a possibility i haven't seen so
[2:13:45] much that god would give me the holy
[2:13:46] ghost well maybe there's a possibility
[2:13:48] amen that i haven't walked out of the
[2:13:50] will of god so much that god won't heal
[2:13:52] me there's a possibility
[2:13:55] let me tell you something you need to
[2:13:57] take that possibility this morning if
[2:14:00] you didn't get your victory yesterday
[2:14:02] get it today
[2:14:04] take that possibility that god will do
[2:14:07] for you
[2:14:09] today what he didn't do yesterday
[2:14:12] hallelujah
[2:14:14] you love the lord
[2:14:16] oh i tell you what people
[2:14:18] i don't know
[2:14:20] and i don't know who this is to
[2:14:22] but i woke up this morning
[2:14:25] and the word is going to be rough now
[2:14:28] but i've got to tell that the word
[2:14:29] incest came
[2:14:31] to my mind
[2:14:32] and i thought no lord
[2:14:34] you know i don't know who you are
[2:14:37] but it wasn't your fault
[2:14:39] and god can't deliver you
[2:14:42] hello
[2:14:43] you don't have to carry that
[2:14:47] i'm no prophet
[2:14:49] but i know when he's talking to me
[2:14:52] and i'm going to tell you something god
[2:14:53] wants to deliver you
[2:14:55] if you didn't get it yesterday
[2:14:57] take the possibility today
[2:14:59] [Music]
[2:15:00] because i'm gonna tell you something
[2:15:01] those kind of things scar people
[2:15:04] hallelujah that's why they end up on
[2:15:05] drugs and alcohol and prostitution and
[2:15:08] everything else because of those kind
[2:15:10] those those scars those things amen that
[2:15:13] makes them feel so unworthy so unclean
[2:15:16] so unfit
[2:15:17] and then they try to find love somewhere
[2:15:20] find love in the wrong places
[2:15:23] hallelujah you understand god understand
[2:15:26] your condition
[2:15:28] hallelujah is that right god saw it when
[2:15:31] it was happening
[2:15:32] oh my but it never changed his mind
[2:15:35] about you

[2:16:34] y'all don't know y'all don't hear
[2:16:36] y'all think i'm crazy but i'm nod

[2:16:59] you're the one who loses but anyway
[2:17:01] let's move on
[2:17:03] so you can understand by god's grace
[2:17:06] amen the sermon the topic because we're
[2:17:08] talking about
[2:17:09] you know uh not allowing any enemy to to
[2:17:13] have victory
[2:17:14] over us and
[2:17:16] and that's i can't stand it
[2:17:19] you know and you've heard me say this
[2:17:20] before people say things to you that's
[2:17:22] not right
[2:17:24] and then they won't repent
[2:17:26] they won't even ask for forgiveness
[2:17:28] and then they're going about their way
[2:17:30] being happy
[2:17:31] but they failed to see they just put you
[2:17:33] in prison
[2:17:34] because you allowed them to
[2:17:40] hello listen if people don't repent and
[2:17:43] say they're sorry don't you worry about
[2:17:46] it you just enjoy jesus
[2:17:49] hallelujah don't let nobody imprison you
[2:17:52] because they don't like you if they they
[2:17:55] don't like what you're doing you just go
[2:17:57] head on and enjoy jesus
[2:18:00] where would brother branham be if he had
[2:18:02] to be worried about what people thought
[2:18:04] about him
[2:18:08] hallelujah know who you are
[2:18:14] is that right
[2:18:16] where would the jews be
[2:18:18] if they worried about what the world
[2:18:19] thought about them
[2:18:22] but they don't care they're literally
[2:18:24] proud to be jews
[2:18:28] and they do everything listen
[2:18:30] people don't understand they want to get
[2:18:32] rid of them but the society of this
[2:18:33] world wouldn't be nothing without the
[2:18:34] jew
[2:18:39] and you and i must understand it won't
[2:18:41] be nothing without us too when we leave
[2:18:43] here chaos coming from everywhere
[2:18:46] hallelujah what you must understand is
[2:18:48] that you are the salt of the earth
[2:18:53] don't lose your effectiveness though
[2:18:56] you lose your affecting if jesus said
[2:18:58] you are worthy to be trodden on the feet
[2:19:00] hallelujah you lose your effectiveness
[2:19:03] you will be tried the feet
[2:19:06] hallelujah love the lord
[2:19:09] that's where the early age left the
[2:19:10] pentecostal age they they went with all
[2:19:12] of the gifts and all that nothing was
[2:19:14] wrong with that but the problem was they
[2:19:16] weren't willing to go further
[2:19:18] you got to go all the way
[2:19:20] we're talking about the perfect statue
[2:19:21] of christ you must go all the way
[2:19:24] that means you've got to die daily you
[2:19:26] got to rot to your thoughts and your
[2:19:27] ideas hallelujah hello this is what i
[2:19:31] was saying yesterday lord let your will
[2:19:34] be done in earth as it is in heaven
[2:19:37] that's jesus prayer
[2:19:39] and whatever they won't do in heaven i
[2:19:42] don't want to do here on earth
[2:19:49] you got to realize by god's grace
[2:19:52] how god looks at this thing
[2:19:55] and understand you got to be one of
[2:19:57] those people say well lord i believe
[2:19:59] mary had no idea how it's going to be
[2:20:02] done
[2:20:03] but she said lord
[2:20:05] be it unto me
[2:20:07] according to your word
[2:20:09] see we don't have to try to figure it
[2:20:11] out
[2:20:12] we don't have to try to process it
[2:20:15] god will do it
[2:20:18] all you got to do is trust him
[2:20:20] lean not to your own understanding
[2:20:23] but acknowledge him in all your ways
[2:20:26] and he shall direct your path i told you
[2:20:28] i'm not going to be long i got just a
[2:20:30] little bit left
[2:20:31] trying to get you to
[2:20:33] to understand
[2:20:35] trusting god with all your heart that's
[2:20:37] that's that's a commandment
[2:20:40] and and and and when you do
[2:20:42] it it uh it drives everything else away
[2:20:48] my old mother who didn't know nothing
[2:20:50] about this message but she was saved she
[2:20:52] was a true christian she couldn't read
[2:20:54] or write i saw more miracles in her life
[2:20:57] than i see around this message
[2:20:59] and she lived it
[2:21:01] she was also a peacemaker
[2:21:03] and she was one woman that had visions
[2:21:05] did y'all know women can have visions
[2:21:07] too yes
[2:21:09] i didn't know how she knew all my stuff

[2:21:20] doing something
[2:21:22] and she said junior she had such a sweet
[2:21:25] voice

[2:21:32] and then she told me i said mama you
[2:21:34] know i'll never do nothing like that
[2:21:36] lying in the face of god and didn't know
[2:21:38] it
[2:21:40] that's why i know i'm bright

[2:21:51] had visions myself lord i'm not boasting
[2:21:56] i didn't mean i didn't even mean for
[2:21:58] that to come out
[2:21:59] but i tell you what i'll say i had
[2:22:02] several in my life
[2:22:04] and that's how i knew my wife was mine
[2:22:08] i was seeking a wife
[2:22:11] and right in the midst of a and it's
[2:22:13] like a television screen it was
[2:22:15] and there was my wife and another woman
[2:22:18] young lady that i thought i liked her
[2:22:20] the other lady i liked and when it came
[2:22:22] to sister ruby it just you know
[2:22:27] i didn't have that
[2:22:29] but you understand what i'm saying
[2:22:32] but when god gave me
[2:22:34] that vision and the one girl moved out
[2:22:37] the way
[2:22:39] and sister ruby stood there
[2:22:41] i said god
[2:22:43] that's your will
[2:22:44] i get up off my knees i'll do it now
[2:22:48] ask my wife

[2:23:21] i said let's go see the bishop
[2:23:24] we went in the bishop office
[2:23:26] talk to him
[2:23:28] you think
[2:23:29] facebook carry news
[2:23:34] when the people saw us coming out of

[2:23:41] carolina in a split second
[2:23:47] yes 40 something years now my wife and i
[2:23:50] been married
[2:23:59] hallelujah
[2:24:01] who could do that
[2:24:05] it was my wife
[2:24:07] who saw the corruption of the church
[2:24:11] and tried to tell me
[2:24:13] it was my wife that god gave eyes to see
[2:24:16] before i saw
[2:24:19] y'all understand what i'm saying
[2:24:21] it was predestinated
[2:24:23] i would not have made it this far
[2:24:25] without
[2:24:26] her i say that all the time my lord
[2:24:29] knows that the truth
[2:24:31] that is the truth
[2:24:34] because nobody could have loved me the
[2:24:35] way she does
[2:24:40] y'all y'all look at me because i'm
[2:24:41] preaching but you don't know what i used
[2:24:43] to be
[2:24:45] and all of the paranoia and all of the
[2:24:47] complexes i had that i did not know i
[2:24:51] [Music]
[2:24:54] had and she's still smiling
[2:24:57] [Music]
[2:25:01] huh
[2:25:02] she even looks younger
[2:25:05] so you look at these things and you say
[2:25:07] well brother what are you trying to say
[2:25:08] trust the lord
[2:25:10] my family say you crazy you don't even
[2:25:13] know this woman i didn't have to know
[2:25:15] her
[2:25:16] [Music]
[2:25:17] rebecca didn't know isaac did she
[2:25:21] but she knew it was god's choosing
[2:25:24] somebody help me here see that's what
[2:25:26] i'm saying when god is in it it's going
[2:25:30] to work out all right
[2:25:33] but you got to trust him
[2:25:35] that's why the prophet turned back
[2:25:37] around and he started walking in the
[2:25:39] storm then all of a sudden god see what
[2:25:42] god did god comes right around and says
[2:25:45] listen can i walk with you
[2:25:48] oh my god
[2:25:53] i'm looking one day
[2:25:54] i'm looking for god to talk to me like
[2:25:57] that
[2:25:58] there's a rapture coming there's a
[2:26:00] changing of the body hallelujah and i'm
[2:26:03] going to hear him say one day come on up

[2:26:27] hmm
[2:26:28] cut loose free and everything else he's
[2:26:30] still working walking in that circle
[2:26:33] walking in that circle designed to be
[2:26:35] free and you don't even know you're free
[2:26:38] that's what i'm talking about every one
[2:26:40] of these traps satan put you in the
[2:26:42] blood of jesus christ has already made
[2:26:44] you free
[2:26:45] [Music]
[2:26:46] but you got to claim your freedom you
[2:26:48] got to walk into your freedom you got to
[2:26:51] stop going around in these circles and
[2:26:54] go straight
[2:26:55] [Music]
[2:26:57] that's the truth if the devil can care
[2:26:59] for you walking in circles you know what
[2:27:00] he does he keeps reminding you of what
[2:27:03] you used to be
[2:27:04] [Applause]
[2:27:06] when the devil who is the liar come to
[2:27:08] you you need to tell him the truth
[2:27:10] tell him i'm the spirit of truth i've
[2:27:12] got the spirit of truth in me and that
[2:27:15] spirit of truth and i we are one
[2:27:18] and devil you are a liar
[2:27:20] hallelujah i know what god has done for
[2:27:23] me
[2:27:23] hallelujah don't you know what he's done
[2:27:25] for you
[2:27:29] we know what he's done for us
[2:27:36] i could have been anything
[2:27:38] i could have been anything i was around
[2:27:40] everything
[2:27:42] but there was something in me
[2:27:45] i call it determination
[2:27:47] that something in me
[2:27:49] refused to let my path become my future
[2:27:56] i couldn't care less what my family was
[2:27:58] doing but i knew i didn't want to be
[2:28:00] that
[2:28:02] you understand me
[2:28:03] and let me tell you something that's
[2:28:05] what drives me even now i see people all
[2:28:08] over the message falling and doing all
[2:28:09] kinds of stuff and i i said to the lord
[2:28:12] i says god something's wrong
[2:28:15] i said what i hear on the tape is not
[2:28:17] what i'm seeing
[2:28:19] y'all understand me i want to see what i
[2:28:22] hear
[2:28:24] the real thing the real life
[2:28:26] and it is happening
[2:28:28] because there are those of us who's not
[2:28:30] married to the system we're married to
[2:28:33] christ and because we're married to
[2:28:35] christ we see him on a daily basis
[2:28:40] he talks to me
[2:28:42] i trust this god talks to you he talks
[2:28:44] to me
[2:28:49] hallelujah god is good
[2:28:51] all right he has showed us or revealed
[2:28:53] it in every type and this is what i was
[2:28:55] trying to tell you when people when
[2:28:57] people when you start typing the old
[2:28:59] testament bringing in the new there's so
[2:29:01] many people will say well brother
[2:29:02] branham didn't say it like that
[2:29:05] but brother berlin said that he's just
[2:29:06] hitting the highlights
[2:29:08] and he's giving it over to these
[2:29:10] ministers who would catch it
[2:29:11] and bring it open it up more to us
[2:29:15] y'all understand me
[2:29:16] so as long as you stay within the word
[2:29:20] with that revelation it is the word
[2:29:26] is that the truth
[2:29:28] so you and i must understand all of
[2:29:30] those shadows and what would we do
[2:29:33] without ruth
[2:29:36] a lorabitis
[2:29:37] a idol worshiper
[2:29:40] whatever she was it was wicked
[2:29:43] and god had already told israel not to
[2:29:45] have anything to do with the moabites
[2:29:48] hallelujah kind of remind me when jesus
[2:29:51] told his disciples don't go to the
[2:29:53] gentiles
[2:29:55] hallelujah but there was still a day of
[2:29:57] purpose
[2:29:59] god had his mind in his mind a day for
[2:30:02] the gentiles
[2:30:03] and when he did he rose up powell
[2:30:06] and paul was a preacher to the gentiles
[2:30:10] thank god for paul
[2:30:16] can you imagine
[2:30:18] you think god didn't give
[2:30:21] uh uh um
[2:30:23] our sister of revelation
[2:30:28] didn't give root a revelation of what
[2:30:30] she was getting into
[2:30:32] she wasn't walking blindly god works on
[2:30:34] both ends
[2:30:35] [Music]
[2:30:37] you hear what i'm saying we didn't come
[2:30:38] to this message blindly this is a
[2:30:41] straight way
[2:30:42] it's a narrow way
[2:30:44] hallelujah it's a harder way
[2:30:48] is that right
[2:30:49] come on somebody
[2:30:51] holiness is holiness
[2:30:54] yes and what we must die to ourselves
[2:30:57] we don't need makeup we don't need high
[2:31:00] heels we don't need sexy clothes we
[2:31:03] don't need none of that stuff why
[2:31:06] because the beauty of god's salvation
[2:31:08] hallelujah god beautifies the meek with
[2:31:12] salvation
[2:31:16] you don't understand but when i was in
[2:31:18] the world i was a part here
[2:31:21] oh yes don't look with us like a shark
[2:31:24] on your face
[2:31:26] i was a partier
[2:31:28] yes sir every weekend everybody knew
[2:31:30] where to come
[2:31:32] because at my house everything was free
[2:31:37] yes sir i brought the booze
[2:31:40] i brought the food i opened the door
[2:31:43] i brought the music i bought everything
[2:31:47] and nobody was gonna out-dance me at my
[2:31:50] party
[2:31:54] that was hard for me
[2:31:56] when those holiness people said you
[2:31:58] can't dance no more i'm like what
[2:32:03] i can't dance no
[2:32:06] you know what i'm saying and that's the
[2:32:07] truth
[2:32:08] when they told me you got to cut your
[2:32:10] head cut my hair
[2:32:13] now i look i look and see how foolish i
[2:32:15] look
[2:32:18] i had all i have we call the afro y'all

[2:32:28] you know because the devil's something
[2:32:30] else he'll make you look like a clown
[2:32:32] and tell you how beautiful you are
[2:32:41] it's the truth

[2:32:48] not trying to peek at somebody i was
[2:32:50] there somewhere i ain't gonna say where
[2:32:52] we were because then if they listen
[2:32:53] they'll know
[2:32:54] they had eyelashes
[2:33:01] that's all i could see
[2:33:03] it's look like i'm trying to be funny
[2:33:06] but look like bugs had to attach
[2:33:08] themselves to the eyes
[2:33:11] and i know them things got to be heavy
[2:33:18] but the devil said you're so pretty
[2:33:23] it's the truth
[2:33:25] but that stuff is wrong
[2:33:27] god loves you the way you are
[2:33:30] [Applause]

[2:33:35] see and i hope you ain't these dog
[2:33:37] lovers be putting these clothes on these
[2:33:39] dogs
[2:33:42] that's dog abuse
[2:33:48] but it's the truth
[2:33:51] now if they if they've been designed
[2:33:53] they can't take the wintertime or
[2:33:54] something like that i understand put a
[2:33:56] blanket over them or something but
[2:33:58] you're gonna have them with gloves on
[2:33:59] and caps on and coats on and you know
[2:34:02] what i'm saying it confuses the dog
[2:34:07] it does i'm sorry
[2:34:10] i'm so sorry but it does
[2:34:15] one time dogs and i don't be doing but
[2:34:17] i've seen this happen
[2:34:18] i'm walking just to be walking trying to
[2:34:20] get some exercise and the dog comes up
[2:34:23] in the truck
[2:34:24] and he looks at me like i feel so sorry
[2:34:26] for you
[2:34:28] you walking and i'm driving
[2:34:32] i don't mean to be funny but it's the
[2:34:33] truth
[2:34:35] they look at you like your health
[2:34:37] they're feeling sorry for you
[2:34:43] [Music]
[2:34:45] [Laughter]
[2:34:48] but it's the truth it's the truth
[2:34:50] oh lord have mercy and i still don't
[2:34:53] understand i know y'all dog lovers y'all

[2:35:15] but i just i can't that's me i'm not
[2:35:18] trying to
[2:35:20] let me stop let me stop i think i went a
[2:35:21] little bit too far but nevertheless
[2:35:24] let's move on by the grace of god
[2:35:27] hallelujah
[2:35:28] yes it's the truth
[2:35:30] [Music]
[2:35:32] it's the truth
[2:35:34] god help us jesus
[2:35:38] people are messed up
[2:35:41] [Music]
[2:35:45] it's the truth
[2:35:46] i went to this person's house and i
[2:35:48] don't mean no harm i'm on the road but i
[2:35:50] went to this person's house and i have
[2:35:51] trouble with cats
[2:35:55] cats love me though that's the truth
[2:36:01] he's fixing me breakfast at lunch it was
[2:36:03] lunch
[2:36:04] and that cat jumped up on the table
[2:36:11] god knows i'm like oh lord
[2:36:13] if the cat is on the table what else he
[2:36:15] can't do when he's on the table
[2:36:19] the food is on the table oh god help me
[2:36:23] so i had to eat in faith
[2:36:27] but i promised the lord i said i'll
[2:36:28] never come back to this house for so
[2:36:30] long
[2:36:31] as long as he got a cat i'm so sorry
[2:36:34] lord help me jesus it's nothing but the
[2:36:37] truth
[2:36:38] it's but the truth and it just show you
[2:36:39] how i value and listen
[2:36:41] they won't care for you like that
[2:36:45] a lot of times people don't care for
[2:36:46] people like that
[2:36:48] they love their dogs and their cats more
[2:36:50] than they love their people
[2:36:54] now that's the truth
[2:36:58] y'all ready to move on i am
[2:37:02] so i want you to understand that
[2:37:03] somewhere we don't lost something we
[2:37:05] lost something
[2:37:08] and and you know we've lost the love and
[2:37:10] affection for each other and everything
[2:37:11] and and and and it's not right we placed
[2:37:15] it with everything everything i was and
[2:37:17] that's the truth and i'm trying to tell
[2:37:19] us listen we've got to move farther than
[2:37:22] this as i was saying the other day about
[2:37:24] science it's okay to have a phone we all
[2:37:26] have them it's almost necessary but you
[2:37:29] know what we find ourselves doing and i
[2:37:31] was at the lake there a couple of
[2:37:33] summers ago and it was this couple in
[2:37:35] the canoe
[2:37:38] i know they got in that canoe fellowship
[2:37:40] with each other
[2:37:42] but they were not
[2:37:44] they both were on their iphones
[2:37:47] in the canoe
[2:37:49] now how romantic can you get
[2:37:55] but that's people
[2:37:57] do you know we had amen a bad accident
[2:37:59] there in lima because teenagers were
[2:38:02] driving instead of talking to each other
[2:38:06] they were all in the car
[2:38:08] but they were texting each other
[2:38:13] and by touching each other they they ran
[2:38:15] and hit
[2:38:17] i think if correct only one one one
[2:38:20] survived is that correct man
[2:38:22] yeah
[2:38:22] four of them was or something like that
[2:38:24] was in the car and they asked them the
[2:38:25] other ones died
[2:38:27] because they were we're losing and see
[2:38:29] you understand what i'm saying satan
[2:38:32] knows what he's doing
[2:38:36] and we can see how blessed how these
[2:38:38] things have really blessed us but if
[2:38:39] you're not careful
[2:38:42] it will capture you and it will cause
[2:38:45] you to give more time to that than you
[2:38:47] will to your husband your children and
[2:38:50] all the others
[2:38:53] and what that's going to do separate
[2:38:55] after a while the kids don't know how to
[2:38:57] communicate with you and you don't know
[2:38:59] how to communicate with them
[2:39:00] [Music]
[2:39:02] let me move on
[2:39:04] we need god
[2:39:06] that discerning that dedication that
[2:39:08] consecration giving more time like that
[2:39:10] brother walked up to me last night he
[2:39:12] said the lord said told me to tell you
[2:39:14] you know if you you uh basically said
[2:39:16] consecrate give more time to him and
[2:39:17] stuff like that
[2:39:18] i took it because it's true
[2:39:21] thank you brother for allowing god to
[2:39:23] use you
[2:39:25] because i know god spoke through you
[2:39:27] and i take it
[2:39:29] thank you
[2:39:32] because we need more consecration
[2:39:35] but he did not know that in my heart in
[2:39:38] my mind only god knew vindicating the
[2:39:42] what was
[2:39:43] spoken to me in my spirit to do
[2:39:45] he didn't know when i got home when i
[2:39:47] get home what my plans were
[2:39:50] but god through him spoke to vindicate
[2:39:53] that that was him and what did it do
[2:39:56] it's solidified
[2:40:00] see
[2:40:02] that's why what we need and that's what
[2:40:04] i'm trying to say oftentimes we're soul
[2:40:06] we're so caught up into the way well i
[2:40:08] don't know whether they're going to
[2:40:09] receive it or not and this and that it
[2:40:11] ain't your business
[2:40:13] if god is telling you to say something
[2:40:14] do something do it
[2:40:18] the church needs you
[2:40:22] almost done almost done so you can
[2:40:24] understand we are in a place right now
[2:40:26] that god wants us to be anointed inside
[2:40:29] and out
[2:40:30] [Music]
[2:40:34] when you're anointed inside
[2:40:37] you become dimensional
[2:40:40] you can see things other people can't
[2:40:47] i've see the hood before brother
[2:40:49] i've seen death
[2:40:54] i wasn't looking for it but i've seen it
[2:40:58] but when you become dimensional not only
[2:41:00] do you see that you also see
[2:41:01] supernatural things
[2:41:06] and it's not something you turn on it's
[2:41:08] just something that turns you on
[2:41:11] it's something that god gives you as a
[2:41:13] as a measure of encouragement or faith
[2:41:16] of i don't know but it helps you out
[2:41:18] but as long as we become these starchy
[2:41:21] old you know
[2:41:26] you know you you know in some churches
[2:41:28] you probably get a better reaction out
[2:41:29] of androids
[2:41:33] at least they respond
[2:41:37] and you know you think to yourself how
[2:41:39] can this be
[2:41:41] with the greatest message ever
[2:41:46] one thing i learned when i played
[2:41:48] football
[2:41:49] believe it or not i did
[2:41:51] i ran cross country too
[2:41:54] and i'm not talking about me
[2:41:56] but i'm talking about the coaches
[2:41:59] one thing they did
[2:42:01] that i appreciate
[2:42:03] they knew how to pull
[2:42:05] everything out of you
[2:42:07] if they saw a potential
[2:42:09] they knew what you can do even when you
[2:42:10] didn't know what you could do
[2:42:12] right
[2:42:13] god is the same way
[2:42:16] god knows how to pull things out of you
[2:42:18] you didn't even know what's in you
[2:42:20] all right i'm a close
[2:42:22] but let me say it like this
[2:42:24] you talk about desperation
[2:42:26] when desperation strikes
[2:42:29] you move in ways that you don't even
[2:42:30] know you're moving
[2:42:32] i remember the time and i don't know
[2:42:34] whether we ever talked about it here
[2:42:35] before but i'm gonna share this
[2:42:37] testimony before i close
[2:42:39] because i know anyway
[2:42:41] when
[2:42:42] my wife and i we had our kids were young
[2:42:44] adam scott how many we had her name is
[2:42:46] gracie
[2:42:47] but gracie uh began to have seizures
[2:42:52] and somehow it would seem like every
[2:42:53] time i would leave to go preach
[2:42:55] gracie would have a seizure
[2:42:58] and one day
[2:43:00] that old devil
[2:43:01] forgot i was home or something
[2:43:04] but anyway he came in my house with that
[2:43:06] seizure
[2:43:07] and i talked to him and i know it might
[2:43:09] sound stupid i said you got a nerve
[2:43:12] to come in my house
[2:43:14] and do my child like that
[2:43:17] yeah but let me tell you something with
[2:43:19] my wife she don't even remember
[2:43:22] desperation
[2:43:24] we we had we had her upstairs
[2:43:27] it was like a coming
[2:43:29] she grabbed the baby and she ran
[2:43:32] upstairs
[2:43:33] and i'm running behind me behind her
[2:43:35] give me the baby she turns around and
[2:43:37] she runs back downstairs
[2:43:40] she was so desperate she didn't know
[2:43:41] what to do
[2:43:43] now my daughter was having such a
[2:43:45] seizure all she was doing is wrote her
[2:43:46] eyes rolled back and she was forming out
[2:43:48] of her mouth
[2:43:50] and we prayed
[2:43:53] then god showed my wife something but we
[2:43:55] prayed and i command that devil to leave
[2:43:59] and then god showed her
[2:44:02] where the prophet of god ripped the
[2:44:04] shirt off of her brother told him and we
[2:44:06] did the same thing to my daughter
[2:44:09] she when she we ripped that thing off
[2:44:11] she had another one or something i
[2:44:13] forgot how that worked because it's been
[2:44:14] so long but my point is we ripped that
[2:44:16] thing off we put that thing in the fire
[2:44:20] we made a fire
[2:44:22] and don't you know that smoke started
[2:44:24] snaking
[2:44:29] we moved out of his way but it snaked
[2:44:31] you understand me
[2:44:33] that whatever the demon was and let me
[2:44:35] she never had another seizure since
[2:44:46] [Applause]
[2:44:48] they gave her some kind of medication
[2:44:50] that made her act like a zombie i said
[2:44:52] oh no we can't have this
[2:44:55] no no no no no no that's messing her
[2:44:57] mind up we're not gonna have listen
[2:44:59] people somewhere you gotta put your foot
[2:45:01] down
[2:45:03] you gotta get sick and tired
[2:45:05] of the devil
[2:45:07] right you gotta put your listen that's
[2:45:09] what i love that song he know who i am
[2:45:18] then if the devil knows who you are then
[2:45:20] you need to know who you are
[2:45:23] i don't i just just you know what i do
[2:45:26] not start fights
[2:45:28] but i learned not to run from them
[2:45:30] either
[2:45:33] it's the truth i got jumped when i was a
[2:45:35] boy by three guys and they beat me up
[2:45:37] really good scratched me all in the face
[2:45:39] stomped me kicked me whatever i didn't
[2:45:41] even know what's going on i was in la la
[2:45:43] land by the time i came to my senses
[2:45:46] because i didn't even understand it but
[2:45:47] i decreed myself i decreed
[2:45:50] i said lord i never i didn't know the
[2:45:52] lord i said i'll never let that happen
[2:45:54] again
[2:45:55] ever
[2:45:56] even when i was in high school this guy
[2:45:58] said let me cheat on your people i said
[2:45:59] no and he had shoulders like that little
[2:46:01] weights like that muscles everywhere
[2:46:04] and all i said i thought to myself
[2:46:07] you know i don't work
[2:46:08] all this time to get an a
[2:46:11] and you think i'm gonna let you cheat on
[2:46:13] my paper
[2:46:15] oh yeah i thought to myself you might
[2:46:18] win
[2:46:19] but you're gonna know you've been in a
[2:46:20] fight
[2:46:21] [Music]
[2:46:25] i don't even tell the devil that no you
[2:46:27] ain't going to win at all
[2:46:29] right
[2:46:30] but i thought to myself you might win
[2:46:33] but you go listen
[2:46:34] you know there's no fairness in fighting
[2:46:38] [Applause]
[2:46:40] no
[2:46:41] people say you ought to be fair no no no
[2:46:43] no if i got if i got some help on the
[2:46:45] side
[2:46:47] whether it be a stick or a brick
[2:46:51] [Applause]
[2:46:55] yeah i'm just being honest
[2:46:57] now i'm not like that now but there's a
[2:46:59] time
[2:47:02] you you wasn't going to do that to me
[2:47:04] you know
[2:47:05] about god's grace god has changed me
[2:47:09] my daddy had a temper on him and his
[2:47:11] temper was to kill he always fought to
[2:47:14] kill he never fought to hurt
[2:47:16] i experienced that mess that temper
[2:47:17] three times in my life
[2:47:19] scared me really bad
[2:47:21] and it wasn't for god i would have hurt
[2:47:24] the
[2:47:25] individual should be hurt or injured or
[2:47:27] something but god gave me grace
[2:47:30] and i think to myself you know god i
[2:47:33] know you've changed me
[2:47:35] because there was a that was something
[2:47:36] in me i didn't know was there but but
[2:47:39] god saw it and he needed to get it out
[2:47:43] and so i really cried out to the lord
[2:47:45] for a straight month to deliver me from
[2:47:47] that temper
[2:47:49] and he did
[2:47:50] and i'm trying to tell you people
[2:47:52] tonight or this morning in closing
[2:47:55] i just kind of jumped around a little
[2:47:56] bit but i wanted to get over to you
[2:47:58] about trust
[2:48:00] trust
[2:48:01] you got to trust him
[2:48:04] trust him
[2:48:06] right it ain't about your mama and your
[2:48:08] daddy trust him
[2:48:11] time is coming
[2:48:13] you won't have nobody else to trust
[2:48:17] you got to trust him
[2:48:19] all your trust you must put in him
[2:48:24] and i find out that every time
[2:48:27] that i don't acknowledge him
[2:48:29] i get in trouble
[2:48:33] you know a physical situation i'm
[2:48:34] dealing with right now because i didn't
[2:48:36] inquire of the lord
[2:48:41] have you ever gone to the doctor
[2:48:43] and they make things worse and better
[2:48:46] that's what i'm talking about
[2:48:48] now you gotta you gotta trust god anyhow
[2:48:52] you see what i'm saying don't worry it
[2:48:54] ain't nothing contagious
[2:48:59] but it's something i know god has
[2:49:01] already healed me from
[2:49:03] [Music]
[2:49:05] and so i'm trusting the lord and
[2:49:06] everything and people of god
[2:49:08] we've had such a wonderful time
[2:49:12] but before we close
[2:49:15] i want to ask if there's anybody who
[2:49:17] desired prayer
[2:49:19] i know we prayed already
[2:49:22] but if that's okay that's fine too
[2:49:27] may i say one more song before the past
[2:49:29] to come
[2:49:31] okay so i'll send it i'll give you a

[2:58:50] would be able to come and
[2:58:52] um
[2:58:53] you know
[2:58:54] the the talk about how many would be
[2:58:57] here and so forth
[2:58:59] and uh if anybody thought anything about
[2:59:02] there being so many of them here that
[2:59:04] was really my fault
[2:59:06] because i kept saying bring them on
[2:59:08] bring more is that all you got can you
[2:59:10] can you bring some more with you
[2:59:13] and what a blessing it has been
[2:59:16] to all of us
[2:59:24] and uh sister ruby
[2:59:26] you know i i tell you that's an
[2:59:28] outstanding story brother brooks that's
[2:59:31] that's real that that is rubber meets
[2:59:34] the road
[2:59:36] now i don't know what i'm going to do
[2:59:40] if i'm sitting in my office one day and
[2:59:42] here comes a boy and a girl a young
[2:59:44] brother and young sister that i didn't
[2:59:46] even know
[2:59:47] knew each other
[2:59:50] had even an interest
[2:59:52] and they walk in and say
[2:59:55] that's going to be that's going to be
[2:59:56] something
[2:59:58] but the bishop must have been okay with
[3:00:00] it was it no
[3:00:03] oh
[3:00:05] [Laughter]
[3:00:09] you know it has to be a love story
[3:00:12] i mean
[3:00:13] oh he'd already chosen somebody for you
[3:00:16] i see but god had a different idea
[3:00:18] didn't he
[3:00:19] he had a different plan
[3:00:21] now the only way that it'll be worth the
[3:00:24] time that we take although it's lovely
[3:00:26] to listen to
[3:00:27] the only way it'll be worth the time is
[3:00:29] if we worship
[3:00:31] if we praise god
[3:00:33] while they're singing and that's what we
[3:00:35] really really really want to do is
[3:00:37] praise god
[3:00:38] i'm not i don't i don't is there
[3:00:40] anything else i need to say brother
[3:00:41] greeley um
[3:00:43] there will be no service here tuesday
[3:00:45] night not because we don't want to be
[3:00:47] with the lord we're going to be with him
[3:00:48] ever all week long
[3:00:51] but uh we all need just a little bit of
[3:00:53] a break just a little sleep would be so

[3:00:59] morning and there will be all kinds of
[3:01:01] different things going on the young
[3:01:02] people are will be together and etc

[3:01:06] when we when the young people have sung
[3:01:09] and we're finished and we have finished
[3:01:12] everything off with praise
[3:01:14] then
[3:01:15] we will dismiss the service
[3:01:18] maybe we'll just do that maybe we'll

[3:14:17] [Music]
[3:14:21] hallelujah
[3:14:22] [Music]
[3:14:25] i'm meaning to say you are dismissed
[3:14:28] in the name of the lord but i felt one
[3:14:30] of those
[3:14:31] joy bubbles
[3:14:34] you are dismissed to go
[3:14:36] in the name of the lord but take the joy
[3:14:38] of god with you
[3:14:39] amen
[3:14:41] whatever jesus says you are
[3:14:47] you know some of us came from holiness
[3:14:49] and pentecost and apostolic church
[3:14:51] and we trusted the men of god that were
[3:14:53] called to lead us
[3:14:55] we trusted them
[3:14:56] and they make a joke about it sometime
[3:14:59] but if they if they felt like they had a
[3:15:01] word from the lord for us
[3:15:04] we believed it even if we hadn't seen it
[3:15:07] yet
[3:15:10] if somebody said i really feel like i
[3:15:12] need to pray for your heart trouble
[3:15:15] and we didn't have heart trouble
[3:15:17] we received prayer anyway because we had
[3:15:20] confidence
[3:15:22] and they used to make a statement they
[3:15:23] say if the man of god says i am i am
[3:15:25] that's just where we come from
[3:15:27] that's just what we what we were taught
[3:15:29] and how we moved well let me tell you
[3:15:31] something
[3:15:32] you are what jesus says you are
[3:15:35] you are
[3:15:36] you can trust him
[3:15:38] you may not feel like you are now
[3:15:42] you may not see it operating in your
[3:15:44] life now
[3:15:46] but now he says
[3:15:48] now he says i am a conqueror
[3:15:52] i am an overcomer hallelujah
[3:15:55] i am healed i am made whole
[3:15:59] by the blood of the lamb
[3:16:01] and there is power
[3:16:03] in speaking and decreeing these things
[3:16:07] over our life
[3:16:08] the world calls them positive
[3:16:11] affirmations
[3:16:12] but you can't get any more positive than
[3:16:14] god's word
[3:16:16] and when you decree decree that and
[3:16:19] declare that and it's it's really
[3:16:21] prophecy
[3:16:22] you're prophesying that over your life
[3:16:25] by the holy ghost and then it's god's
[3:16:28] business
[3:16:29] to make you manifest
[3:16:31] that you're a conqueror it's god's
[3:16:34] business to bring that to pass if you
[3:16:36] decree it and declare it in faith
[3:16:38] now i behaved i've i've tried my best to
[3:16:42] behave this week
[3:16:43] but i had to get that out
[3:16:45] you are dismissed a goal for about the
[3:16:48] tenth time
[3:16:49] but as you go out would you clap your
[3:16:51] hands for this youth group
[3:16:54] one more time
[3:17:03] they are
[3:17:04] they get
[3:17:06] they get very excited about volleyball
[3:17:10] most of them volleyball sometimes i
[3:17:13] can't even come and watch them
[3:17:16] there's only certain sundays i can come
[3:17:18] if it's a nervous sunday if i've gone
[3:17:20] home nervous
[3:17:22] i can't even come watch them play
[3:17:24] because they get quite
[3:17:26] competitive
[3:17:29] and that takes me back to
[3:17:31] how it was preached to us
[3:17:33] emulations they used to call it you know
[3:17:35] striving and so forth makes me nervous
[3:17:38] but they must have this idea that i'm
[3:17:41] going to do if i'm going to do it i'm
[3:17:42] going to do the best i can
[3:17:45] and i'm going to be the best i can and
[3:17:47] they're passionate about that and we
[3:17:49] allow them to do that
[3:17:51] but i want you to know i'm so thankful
[3:17:53] for this passion
[3:17:55] they're worshipers
[3:17:57] they're worshipers
[3:17:59] and they have a passion to follow jesus
[3:18:02] christ
[3:18:03] don't you
[3:18:05] you look a little weary and tired i love
[3:18:08] you every one of you god bless you
[3:18:10] you're dismissed to go today in jesus
[3:18:12] name
[3:18:14] [Music]
[3:18:23] [Music]
[3:18:51] [Music]
[3:18:53] you
