sister Beverly we didn't forget you would you bring your song back Tuesday night sing it please God is moving by his spirit he's moving all over the Earth signs and wonders where God is moving move O Lord in me in me he's moving all over the Earth but he didn't call me all over the Earth this week he called me right here and he's moving by his Spirit right here this is where he called us today we've come faithful I honor you for your faithfulness to the house of the Lord I honor you for pressing in and helping to create the atmosphere can have a good song leader but if the congregation doesn't participate all he is is singing himself but we are blessed to have a marvelous worship leader in Benjamin Shelley who gives everything as he's leading worship and we have a group of people that have heard the word of the Lord through a pastor that wants people to move to dance to kneel to lift their hands to clap their hands to stomp their feet to just move about worshiping the Lord and you have responded to that and you can continue to respond to that and it helps to create the atmosphere in the house of the Lord I bring you greetings from Brother Shelley the stream was not behaving on Tuesday night there were only a couple that I know of that even got to see the stream but uh most people could not see it but he said he thought that that made him miss us even more but he sends his love from him and his family to all of us and I believe they're watching today and so we send our love and greetings back to them in Florida they're watching this service and we just want to tell them how much we love them and miss them here in the house of the Lord I have a very peculiar scripture that I would like to read today from Proverbs chapter 5. Proverbs chapter 5. starting with verse 1. Proverbs 5 verse 1 my son attend unto my wisdom and bow thine ear to my understanding that thou mayest regard discretion and that thy lips may keep knowledge for the lips of a strange woman drop as in honeycomb and her mouth is smoother than oil but her end is bitter as wormwood she sharp as a two-edged sword her feet go down to death her steps take hold on hell lest thou shouldest Ponder the path of life her ways are movable that thou canst not know them hear me now therefore o you children and depart not from the words of my mouth remove thy way far from her and come not nigh the door of her house lest thou give thine honor unto others and thy years unto the cruel lest strangers be filled with thy wealth and thy labors be in the house of a stranger and They Mourn at the last when thy flesh and thy body are consumed and say how have I hated instruction and my heart despised reproof and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers nor incline my ear to them that instructed me I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and the assembly I'll conclude reading right there for today May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats now if you've been around for very long you will know that Solomon had a problem with women Solomon being the son of David and Bathsheba and you think about all of the course of events that came up to the day of Solomon how that David although he had the Bible tells us that he was a man after God's Own Heart there was something in David that he was a worshiper and he wanted to please the Lord with everything that was within him and the scripture tells us that as was normal for Kings they went out in the spring to fight their battles and there was one particular spring that David decided that he was not going to go out to battle but he was going to stay at home and let others fight the battle for him might I say to any of us whether we be young middle-aged or feel like we're old there is nobody that can fight the battle like you can fight the battle God has put a sword in your hand to wield and to fight the enemy and even if you feel like that you can't fight like somebody else can fight God gave you the sword of the word of God to defend your little parcel of ground however large it may be as we heard a few weeks ago that God wants us to defend what is ours he doesn't want us to stand back and expect somebody else to defend it for us he wants us to fight with everything that's within us but on this particular spring David decided that he was not going to go into battle he was going to let someone else go into battle and he was going to sit at home and he was going to stay in his kingly chair perhaps and he was going to just take it easy this season but that was not what God wanted him to do God it was ordained that he should be in the battle with the rest of them how bad he was at home and and as he's home he begins to uh probably get a little bored because he knew that his men were out fighting for for the kingdom and he was at home and his eye got to roving huh because he had a lot of idleness on his hand and he wasn't fighting the battle read between the lines friends when we're not fighting the battle we allow our mind to become Idol we look for other things to entertain us David was looking for something else to entertain him he found a woman was of no fault of hers but he was looking and Bathsheba was brought to his house and the through the course of events she became expected and then he brought her husband home and tried to make it till that he could have time with his wife so it would look like it was his child and so on and so on and things spiraled out of control and it ended up that he had to have Uriah killed to try to cover his sin and you and I will do the same thing if we allow ourselves to have this roving eye we're going to look for excuses and we're going to try to cover our sin David is recognizing now that he's got trouble on his hand and he has Uriah killed and uh he see he has Uriah put in the Forefront of the battle and has him killed the child that Bathsheba was carrying was David's child and that child died how big God gave her another child by the name of Solomon and Solomon was David said that he would sit on the throne came time as he grew up David was getting old and it looked like somebody was going to usurp the throne and bathshebus came to David and said you told me that Solomon was going to sit on the throne and David made that happen now Solomon was a young man so Solomon did not have to go out and fight battles like David did everything was taken care of for Solomon but Solomon he loved women and I don't know exactly how it all started perhaps there was some DNA that God passed down to him from David I do not know that but we do not see although that Solomon was a man of great wisdom the Bible tells us he asked the Lord for wisdom and God granted to him this gift of wisdom because you have not asked for this or asked for that to promote yourself I'm giving you this gift of wisdom but it doesn't appear that Solomon had the same Heart of Worship as his father David and as Solomon began to grow and understand that this kingdom was on his shoulders Solomon he saw that the people were coming to him because they wanted to see the wisdom that Solomon had they wanted his gift oh they had questions in their minds and they wanted his gift and their asker coming to him traveling from miles around asking him wanting to know about this or that to understand what is the meaning of this in my life and Solomon began to gain notoriety throughout the whole Earth because of his wisdom wisdom that was unsurpassed because it came from the hand of God but as he has this gift it was a gift from God it was a gift from God that God allowed Solomon to use but it did not keep Solomon to have a heart like his father had gifts and callings the Bible tells us are without repentance I'll there was something in Solomon that he saw what his dad desired to build a temple a place of permanent structure so that the tent didn't have to be moved from place to place and Solomon desired to get that built and there was great wealth that came into the kingdom and Solomon understood that this was a burden that had been laid on him by his father to build this and so all of these things are being done uh the the temple being built and and Solomon is while all that is being done Solomon is having people come into the kingdom and they're bringing wealth into the kingdom and it's helping to get the temple built and it's building Solomon's coffers the King's coffers and Solomon is getting more and more attention as time goes along but as he goes along he is he is to his heart is turned away from the things of God to other women what's up now women and these were not women of the House of Israel these were women of pagan kingdoms all around that around the earth they were Pagan kingdoms that came to Solomon because they wanted to know the wisdom and so in order for them to uh make a a covenant with Solomon they would give wives to Solomon and these women brought with them all of their idolatries they brought with them their their things that they had uh worshiping in their country they when they came to him all they heard was about the wisdom of Solomon they didn't really uh they weren't really interested in the god of Israel they wanted the wisdom of Solomon they wanted their questions answered similar to what we've had in our day they didn't want the truth of the word of God they wanted the Loaves and the fishes but when God begins to speak and say uh they eat my flesh and drink my blood many of them walked away but there were many of these women that were stuck in the Kingdom with Solomon and then he housed them and can you just imagine you have a home that you live in uh you you men with with one wife a few children one or two or three or four or five or ten or however many you have one house and you think about the cost of that one house now Solomon as his women the wives the concubines are being added to him they have to have a hotel to stay in have to have a house to live in there's got to be Cooks there's got to be people that look after them because in that kind of a society the women didn't clean their own room they didn't fix their own hair you know it's it's all done for them so all of this expense that is being poured into taking care of these women that are brought into the kingdom for Solomon their gifts to him but all of the while Solomon is is turn his heart is being turned away from the things of the Living God and it's being turned toward these women and their idolatrous things that they've brought with them and so Solomon he is he is pondering the things of life he's thinking about all of these women that he has and he begins to speak in such a way vanity of vanities it's all vanity and vexation of spirit because he realizes that these women have not brought him the satisfaction that he desires they've they've not brought to him the satisfaction that he needs in the Inner Man all they're doing is fulfilling the fleshly lusts of of one man and Solomon doesn't really know what to do with that but as he is as he is laying this out in the Proverbs he's wanting his son to understand that all of these women are not the answer to what a man needs and he says the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb and her mouth is smoother than oil but her end is bitter as wormwood sharp as a two-edged sword her feet go down to death her steps take hold on hell and then in verse 6 he says something that kind of grabbed my attention lest thou part should Ponder the path of life her ways are movable that you cannot know them now any of you young men that have ever looked for a wife or are currently looking for a wife the brothel is not a place to go to find one Solomon recognized as he's watching these women that have come from other cultures from other places that have been given to him as concubines or as wives however you wish to say it he starts recognizing a pattern that that if they are not godly that there's going to be something about her that's going to be seductive that's going to be wooing but there's going to be an end that is not going to be good and he set her lips the lips of a strange woman they drop as honeycomb well when I think of honeycomb I think about something sweet and then I don't I've I've never been in a position to even think like this uh trying to find a woman outside of of the Covenant of the Lord but Solomon is in this kind of a position where he recognizes that a strange woman one that is not under the Covenant of Israel she has she has something that comes out of her mouth something that comes through her lips that is sweet as honeycomb and she makes it sound beautiful she makes it sound like you are the most handsome man that ever walked the face of the Earth there is no one that is better than you you have all the qualities that she wants and this is the sweetness that is coming out of her mouth but Solomon said her and is bitter as wormwood sharp as a two-edged sword now when I think about a two-edged sword I think about Ephesians or rather Hebrews 4 12 the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword a two-edged sword has a sharp edge on both sides but this two-edged sword that Solomon is talking about is not the word of God but it is a word that comes out of a mouth of a strange woman that will cut a man to mince meat when she is finished with him he goes on to say that her feet go down to death her steps hold on hell but verse 6 says lest you should Ponder the path of life let me just stop here just a moment a young man looking for a wife should always think about more than the moment because Beauty will fade away Beauty real true beauty it goes much deeper than just the skin level and a man who is choosing a wife one who claims a man who claims to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost he does not go outside of a church setting looking for a wife nor does a woman go outside of a church setting looking for a husband because we don't need a we don't need a divided household but a man when he begins to look for a wife when he really is searching Solomon is saying be careful watch that strange woman you stay away from her lest you should even Ponder the way of life with her can I really get along with her could I live with her she puts on lipstick but could I could I could I live with that she puts this stuff all over her eyes but you know maybe it's not so bad I think I maybe I could live with that she likes to go down to the bar on Saturday night and have some drink but the rest of the time she's a pretty good woman maybe I can live with that lest he should Ponder the way of life with her her ways are movable this woman Solomon is realizing that he has a bunch of women and he's trying to get a word to his sons you be careful that you don't choose this kind of a woman because her ways are movable today she's going to be one way tomorrow she may even be the same way the next day she may be something else so lest you should consider a life with her ways are movable they're not going to remain the same they they are so movable that you can't even know them all right and Solomon continues to exhort the children here now I pray you children and depart not from the words of my mouth remove thy way far from her and come not nigh to the door of her house lest thou should give thy honor unto others and thy years unto the cruel now I am not saying anything today to be offensive but there are many people who have made wrong choices and they've ended up in a serious situation and they've paid a deer price for it dear price and by the grace of God some that are sitting here today have been able to pick up the pieces and let the mercies of God touch them and move on God gave us the institution of marriage between one man and one woman for life foreign divorce was never his original plan he said it wasn't so from the beginning and so when divorce happens it calls his real true believers to remain in an unmarried state and again I'm not here to be offensive it's not even real out where I want to go with this today but we must recognize as children of God that God when he comes and he forgives us we must remain as we are and keep moving forward in the things of God and let the mercies of God continue to come down over us now Solomon recognized that this woman these women their ways were movable today they may give you one story and tomorrow they may give you another story now I am not here to bash women in any way no I'm not here for that but I recognize that there is a Godly concept that the Lord has given to his people in the end time that he wants us to follow a straight and a narrow pathway and that the the the way of the world is not going to work for us it's a stain because we have been called to a high and a holy calling a supernatural calling that we are to live by and we cannot remain down here just doing the status quo of what everybody else is doing it won't work my mind goes back to when brother Branham preached choosing of a bride in 1965. a brother Branham he was watching the decline of women in the 40s the 50s and the 60s he was watching their decline and he saw how that they were declining and he talked so much about the way the women who are declining as the way of women so goes the church he said because that the the church was typed as a woman and when he saw the decline in the church he recognized in the women rather he saw the decline in the church as well and he continued to cry out against all of the things that were changing now when we observe what was happening then and we realize how much farther it has come today and we as individuals may get caught up in a mindset of certain things well that's not so bad now I we know that Solomon he had his issues and these issues progressed and went along we know that David made the mistake with Bathsheba then Solomon he had many women and when Solomon when when he uh died and rehoboam took the throne and then the kingdom was divided and as time went on and you had the Kingdom of Israel the kingdom of Judah and you go on down and you watch the decline of the Kingdom as Ahab took the throne and as Ahab took the throne even though he was the king he had a jezebel and we can see by history that Jezebel was the neck that turned the head Ahab was the head but he had Jezebel beside of him whom he was constantly saying yes dear are you man lest you should think I'm some kind of a chauvinist there are some times it's very wise to say Yes dear Yes dear because there are some things that don't really matter in the whole scheme of things but men husbands daddies when it's time to be a dad when it's time to be a husband it is important that you don't let that yes dear syndrome get on you because the man is the head of the house he has been set in that place in divine order according to the scripture and he is to lead the household he is to be the head over his wife even as Christ the church and he's to love his wife as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it there are so many men that like that feeling of authority over their wives and they want to usurp that Authority and they want to wield the sword over their wife and they don't know how to treat her like a queen she's still your queen you chose her now brother Branham talked about in the choosing of a bride he was talking about the the watching this this farmer as he's watching these cows come through this fence and he toy he was watching this man this Rancher he's watching him as he's keeping an eye looking right in the face of these cattle as they come through the chute and brother Branham couldn't understand he said what's the matter what's this man doing is he some kind of a cow Whisperer or something he's looking at her in the eye and then he begins to explain to brother randomly says let me tell you something I look in their eyes because if that cow has a wild stare in their eye she'll never be a mother to her calf she's been in a stall and she's fat right now but with that wild stare she will never be a mother to her calf she'll run wild and she'll be skinny and she won't be what she needs to be so I don't want that wild stare and that really struck inspiration into brother Brennan because he began to talk about how that there were women with that wild stare they they're lest you should Ponder life with her her ways are movable now let's turn this a bit Ahab was the king he had a jezebel beside of him now there is something happening in that Kingdom that Jezebel is really behind the scenes ruling the roost when Ahab got to a place where that he wanted naboth's Vineyard and he tried to make an offer to naboth naboth says no you can't hide my piece of land naboth was standing firm to say this is my piece of ground and you can't have it no matter what you offer me for it it's mine it's my inheritance it's my Heritage you can't have it Ahab goes back to the Palace crying and and he turns his face toward the wall and he won't eat poor little guy Jezebel comes in and oh baby what's the matter with you naboth won't sell me his Vineyard but don't you worry you take your rest I'll take care of things and she did she had him killed but that wasn't the end of the story because God had an Elijah on the scene that was going to set things in divine order because God always has a divine order now we can we can watch the declines of the kingdom and we see that there was there was an athalia and she uh she just said she destroyed all the seed Royal and and she was one who just wanted to destroy everybody and this is she wanted to rule the roost because there was some kind of a wild stare in athaliah's eyes she wanted the power but there was a relative who hid Josh now if you follow the genealogy there was a descendant of athaliah who was married to a priest and they together hid joash in the temple for six years now I don't know how you keep a child from being exposed for six years I don't know how all that happens but jehoiah the priest was able to keep that child in the inner inner rooms of the Temple to preserve his life till at the appointed time joash could be brought out as the king and athaliah could scream treason but God had it ordained that way now in the lead-up to this jehu was one that God had ordained and he was taking care of business and the Bible tells us that he drove furiously like some of us as jehu is taking care of business I'm bringing this in because I I'm about to twist here as Jay who is taking care of business and he's riding along he comes upon this Bedouin named Johanna dab and he reaches out his hand and he beckons him to come he asks him is your heart right and Johanna dab says yeah my heart's right and jehu invites him up into the into the Chariot with him and jehu whips those horses and he moves along and he continues taking care of business now Johanna dab was a Bedouin and is he is keeping his family in line he is instructing them he instructed them don't drink wine he instructed them that they were to live in tents he gave them some other instruction along the way and they had been true to that instruction so when jehu says is Your Heart Right immediately Johanna dab says yes it is then in the book of Jeremiah Jeremiah is told by the Lord I want you to bring the sons of Johanna dab I want you to bring them and I want you to put wine plenty of wine and cups before their faces and tell them to drink it so this is the word of the Lord to Jeremiah Jeremiah does so he goes and he finds the son of Sons of Johanna dab and he puts out plenty of wine with plenty of Cups and he says drink the wine those men said we will not do it we were instructed by our father not to drink wine that we were to live in tents that we are to be nomads and there were some armies that have uh pushed in against us and so we came to Jerusalem but there's one thing that we remain true to and that was that we did not drink wine and they made such an impression on Jeremiah and God spoke to Jeremiah and said because they've held fast to this that they were this instruction that was given by their fathers they will not fail to have a place before me because somebody stuck by their convictions somebody heard their daddy say don't drink wine live in a tent be a better one and these men had stuck to at least one thing don't drink wine I just want to say to you daddy's you create a standard in your household [Music] and if nobody else wants to live by the standard for your household God did not instruct you for another household he gave you the authority over your own hold fast to it teach it to your sons and your daughters so that they will hold fast to it now what does that have to do with Proverbs Chapter 5. here's where I want to go now we recognize by the teachings that we have had through the years that there is a system of religion that has been pressing in on the people of God for ages and generations we have watched it down through we we've seen by history down Through the Ages as these horse riders have come with a with an anointing to be uh to put upon them to try to destroy the Church of the Living God and in every age there has been a a counterfeit to the purposes of God the enemy has ridden in on his horse of whatever color it was at the time to try to destroy the covering to try to destroy God's people to try to get people to change their mind about what they had been taught foreign Church ages when the Apostle Paul had been preaching and teaching concerning the things of God and how that there should be this conduct among the people of the Living God and and Paul he was teaching that there were some things that when the Lord Jesus came there were things that were fulfilled that you could never do enough of the law to be able to satisfy and so when Jesus Christ came he was the Fulfillment of it and when you are in Christ some of those things were no longer necessary there were other things that Paul never said you can do away with this there was something inside of them that they recognized that there were certain things that they needed to remember they needed to honor they needed to uh every year whenever these things came around they needed to be a part of honoring that but as religion pressed in and as the apostles died out and men with out the spirit of God that that had an intellectual knowledge of what Paul was preaching who could come as as as some did and say we come in the name of Jesus who Paul preached that would not work it was an intellectual religion that did not bring the same results the same power the same Authority as what Paul was preaching when he was alive there were men that still had that same power and authority but there were others who were trying to uh trying to imitate it and in their imitation they're pulling the people away from the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and they are trying to give them another gospel we watched this through the church ages as the Roman system we see that they're offering a substitute to the people to try to get them to be one conglomeration we'll say a one world order of churches they wanted everybody to do the same thing but they weren't getting everybody doing the same thing according to the word of God they were doing it according to the thoughts of men so as they're giving their own thoughts every man has his own thoughts I have my own thoughts and I have had thoughts through the years I've had opinions about things that the Holy Spirit has had to come and correct those things to help me to see that I was in error that I was that I was allowing myself to have an idea of an organized religion and this is the way that people have done down Through the Ages they have allowed themselves to get under the popular view of things because it was easier to come to the popular view of things than to be that uh one that was always saying not so not so not so not so there were some that started out well preaching the whole truth but they got tired of being the odd man out most people don't like to be the oddball we don't like to be odd people peculiar people we don't we don't like to be the one that just looks so different acts so different has a different theology than all the rest of the church world but friends I'm telling you God is calling a people in this hour that if if we're going to really truly be that Supernatural race of people we're going to have to be in full and total alignment with the word of God and we're not going to be able to run after other things that other people have bless them if they if they want all of the things of the world then let them have it I've got to follow the lord Jesus with everything that's within me I don't know that I have ever ever Googled World Council of churches until yesterday and I find it incredibly interesting that Friday Friday they installed a new general secretary to the World Council of churches what does that have to do with us preacher you see the World Council of churches the Branham talked about this many times he talked about a council of churches that wanted people to come under one umbrella so that we can all do things the same way the only thing is that same way is not according to the word of God and so that means that I cannot come under the umbrella of a World Council of church your churches and know that I'm going to walk in the Supernatural because if we're all the same and we're all doing things the same and it's not according to the word of God we're no longer walking in the Supernatural we are no longer walking under the blessing of the Living God according to the word of God now we see the Roman system Through the Ages as it has tried to get its tentacles here and there and everywhere to try to break down the real word of God and we are uh we are a group of people who have been ridiculed because we have tried to get all of the sources of romanism out of our life all of it preacher are you going there again yes I believe I will because as Solomon said about a woman that I was was of ill repute that a man would Ponder his life with her to say can I get along with her if she decides to do this can I get along with her if she decides to to put a little paint on her face can I get along with her if she decides to go run around with another man can I get along with her can can we still have our household her ways are movable and this is the same way it is with this mother of harlots the King James Bible calls her a a mother of harlots which means that she has daughters and all of the while this system is trying to get its tentacles into the Church of the Living God to give you an alternate religion to pull you away from the truth of the word of God to give you some kind of a substitute to pull you away from truth now what we see is as the ages have unfolded and we we can go back and we can look at the history of those ages and we see how that the Deeds became Doctrine and as the Deeds became Doctrine the people then were no longer under the doctrine of this they were under a man-made Doctrine now we know that as it was when the serpent came to the woman in the garden there is lots of Truth in it but there is untruth in it and as that untruth see the when the enemy comes to you and says oh that ain't so bad he paints it as beautifully as he can you ever seen one of these pictures where they tell you how many birds can you find in this picture and they're hidden in there in such a way that you maybe can get five or six of them but there's actually seven and you just can't seem to find that that's the way the enemy does he paints this beautiful picture and he puts truths in it and he puts lies in it and he covers up those lies he covers up those lies and you may catch two or three or four or five of them but there's actually seven in there or maybe there's ten and you not catching them all but that's the way the enemy works because he doesn't want you to catch all of the lies that are are in that picture and he wants you to partake of his picture he wants you to be a part of his his picture because he doesn't want you to walk in the fullness of your destiny we want you to miss part of it and so he brings things into your life to cause you to think well that's that's not so bad I I can get by with this I can I can still go to church and nobody knows what I'm doing here it'll it'll be okay as long as I go to church and I I've participate and I do my part and I pay my tithe and get my offering I I can do I can do this and nobody has to know about it but friends God knows about it now we can talk about how that the works of the flesh get a hold of us and we can talk about some things that we have conquered in the past about the way we dress or the way we live but there are things that the enemy tries to hide in such a way that we can't see them very clearly and so then God has to he has to bring them Time After Time After Time because we've got to see the way that they're rooted in a religious system to try to keep us from our full walk with the Lord don't have to preach over again about all the pagan holidays you don't have to do that but what I would like to say is we have been blessed to have a message in this day to help us to see truth and in that message there were little things that were dropped along the way and we can take our time and we can explain them away and say there's nothing wrong with that he did it what can possibly be wrong with it here is what I would say when I'm standing here under the anointing as any man of God under the anointing there's a boldness that comes over us to be able to say things according to the word and the will of God when a man gets out from under that anointing and he has to go live with his wife his children he still has to set his house in order it doesn't negate the word of God that comes across the pulpit no it doesn't it doesn't negate the word of God that comes across this Pulpit or any Pulpit for that matter the word of God Stands Strong it stands true and we've got to base Our Lives not on what a preacher does but on the word of God and when there is when we recognize that there are things in our house that we have allowed to creep in then we've got to get rid of them we've got to set our own house in order you say preacher if I do what you're saying then it's going to make my my family look like a freak family because we're getting rid of this and we're getting rid of that and we're getting go ahead because when it comes down to the end you're the man that's got to stand for your household and give answer for what you've allowed to creep into the house because you are the priest of your home and you've got to answer for it now you know in the in the early days of this ministry when I first came Disney was preached against and let me just say it would have been a good idea hello if we as parents had kept strong on that very thought because now in 2023 we see how that the demon spirits that have ridden in on Disney and all of the wokeness and the lgbtq plus and all of that stuff that's written in and and it's hidden in little uh messages in these little movies that are for the kitties and there are Disney's not the only ones friends [Music] it's not the only ones but these little in these little hidden agendas that are in these movies that our children watch and we think that they're innocent and yet they're not why are you preaching about this preacher because I see how that we have allowed things to come and we see that the ways of this woman are movable they're movable you say well we ought to be movable and fluid that's right we as the children of God we go with the flow of the spirit not with the flow of Hollywood cannot be our movement it's got to be by the spirit of God that we move because we don't want under to be under the sound of a strange woman we want to be under the sound of our mate the Lord Jesus Christ and when the word is being preached and when the word is going forth and we hear the sound of Truth we need to say yes Lord I will so this the book of the revelation we see that this mother of harlots was not satisfied just to keep her Doctrine to herself to keep her religion to herself she wanted it passed down and passed down and passed down and passed down so here we are in our hour where that it's been passed down and passed down and passed down and because that we have been people who have listened to the word of God and we have listened to intellectual preachers some of which may have never had the baptism of the Holy Ghost we have heard what they had to say which they had heard from a previous generation what they had to say and so things began to get watered down the the word of God gets watered down to the point that people then they say well what's wrong with that [Music] what's wrong with that well let me turn the question around to you what's right with that amen let's just go to the most recent one since I started up Tuesday night what's right with Valentine's Day let's write with it oh it makes me feel so loved the fact is if you trace it back to some of its roots and the filthiness of it you don't want it then you realize all of the money that is spent on cards and flowers and chocolates nothing wrong with flowers and nothing wrong with chocolate and nothing wrong with a card nothing wrong with them yet when there is all of these symbols of paganism that are inner wove into their holiday then a Believer has to say what is right with it what can I say that's right about Valentine's Day what can I say that's right about Halloween what can I say that's right about Christmas what can I say that's right about Easter well isn't Easter about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus no no another Pagan deity there involved so we don't want nothing to do with that now I I've just talked about these holidays you see we get we get smacked up side to head by people because that we want to uh honor the feasts of the Lord they're Jewish feasts nope not what the word says they're called the feasts of the Lord and so I want to honor what is the Lord's and and if if it's something that he had such a a fondness to such a a repetition that he wanted his people to remember it where that they had all the men had to go up to Jerusalem one time a year for each of those feasts so three times a year they were supposed to go up to Jerusalem there was something special in the mind of God that he wanted them to remember it and why would we as Christian Believers want to remember it because we see all of the ways that it was pointing toward the lord Jesus Christ and the crucifixion and the resurrection and all of these things that were for us Passover pesach remembering the blood and the body of the Lord and how that he when they remembered the Feast of the Lord it was because that they God wanted them to remember that they were brought out by a mighty strong hand out from under the uh the bondage of Egypt and a Believer can recognize as they remember Passover they can remember how that they were under Egypt's bondage and there was such a bondage over them until that they were under the task masters of the enemy and there came a day where that to deliverer the Lord Jesus Christ came and he delivered us out from under those task Masters and he invited us to eat his body and to drink his blood the body word of the Lord Jesus Christ foreign word of the Lord Jesus Christ is not mixed with Fables it's not mixed with tradition it's not mixed now that ain't saying that we don't have traditions there is nothing wrong with traditions the problem that Jesus had with the with the Sadducees and the Pharisees and all of the clerical guys of this day was that they put their Traditions above the word of God thank you teach as gospel you teach as Commandments your traditions that is why that if I light a Shabbat candle I cannot say that it's the Commandment because it's not God's commandment it's a rabbinical commandment now if you say it's according to the Commandment of the rabbis okay but it's not a commandment of the Lord that I light a Shabbat candle if I wish to do it it's to honor that I know the Lord of Shabbat he is the one who said come unto me all you that weary are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest and he has given us rest now I admit to you today that there are days that I cannot find my way into his rest because I'm fighting my own battles and I don't know how to get there after all of these years I'm ashamed to tell you there are times that I feel like I don't know how to get there but yet there's rest for the weary and there is a way for me to get there and what it amounts to is I don't use what I know because I have been given a voice a voice of Praise as you have to be able to Worship the Lord and give adoration to the god of Heaven for all that he has done for me and that brings a Liberation in us and it gets us out from heavy loads so many times and there are other times where we just can't seem to open our mouth foreign we just we we just can't seem to do it but it's there all the time it is ours so then it comes back to that lovely thing of choice how many have ever had an easy battle I'm not talking about all through life I'm just talking about maybe one time you went into a battle and you came out the other side and you say oh God has been so good to me that was kind of easy sure we have sure we have and we had strategy for that moment and we knew what to say we knew what to do we we just felt like it was just right there and we came through it and felt like wow Lord you are so good and there are other times where that we came into a battle and it looks similar to that battle that looked so easy and we try the same strategies and we try the same thing and it seems like that we're just beating our head against a brick wall and we can't seem to get any traction to to get through this battle and we wonder well what's going on why is this one harder well friends not every battle is going to be easy not every battle is going to be overcome the exact same way the channel that worked for one battle was not may not be used on the next one the same channel that we get in in a spirit of worship may not work in the next service it is that we have got to hear the mind of the Lord for the moment and in order for us to get a stronger bow a stronger resistance in us to the enemy there's got to be harder battles nobody wants to hear that nobody wants to hear that but yet we come with this with this word with this warning that the battle is going to get hot and heavy well wait a minute preacher I thought we were going to have a supernatural year well not everything's Supernatural is easy to come by it takes a lot of dying out it takes a lot of getting rid of self it takes a lot of uh saying not my will but thy will be done O Lord and as weak this this bride of Jesus Christ as we come down to the end of all things the battle gets hot and heavy and the the not only the World Council of churches but even those that say they believe the same thing that we do start pressing in and say that's not necessary that's not necessary we don't have to live that strict we don't have to live like that yeah yeah yeah and we hear these voices and they're they're just pressing in on our mind because the enemy wants to break down your will because he wants you to be a part of this woman that's always moving nothing ever stable nothing ever concrete but the word of God is sure the word of God is steadfast the word of God is immovable it doesn't change he is the same yesterday and today and forever he is the same and his word will remain the same and when we can understand that we cannot run after another woman a real man of God is not going to go after another woman other than his wife a young man with the Holy Ghost is not going to be chasing two or three girls at the same time he's going to get a hold of God and he's going to say Lord you show me you help me and a real man of God is not going to be trying to chase after the truth of God's word and the traditions of man and another religious system that man of God is going to say Lord I have got to put my eyes right on you I am I am one who has to have the truth I can't have it mixed with another man's religion I've got to know is am I am I if I am partaking of this is this something that is going to help me or is this something that is going to hurt me foreign term or long term is it going to help me or is it going to hurt me I've got to know religion will not see you through to the rapture relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ's will and I would encourage you as a body of Believers those that are watching this I would encourage us everyone that we really look at the scope of our life and we say am I doing religion or am I having a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ am I going after man's ideas or am I really listening to the word of God am I here to say not my will Lord not my will I I listen if the traditions of men could have produced a rapture been done but that's not what's going to produce a Rapture it's going to be a group of people that are willing to lay down everything the musicians are coming please we could have debate about things that we might think are okay we might debate about them and and say you know there's there's really nothing wrong with that and today there might not be you just you think about some of the things that we have heard on recorded sermons from the 50s and 60s that were cried out against and it looked so innocent then and we thought what's wrong with that but then you watch the progression of it through the years that servant of the Lord is gone but what he said you watch the progression of it and as it progresses on through the years and you see where it is today you will see that that a prophet Seer could see further than that day you would see that he could see the end of it was leading somebody their feet to hell it was leading them astray and the end thereof would not be a a of a nature to where that it would bring about the The Godly character that was needed in the end time for the Bride of Jesus Christ but it was producing more of the same either status quo or the other direction because that's what things of the flesh will do so you I all of us when the word of God goes across this Pulpit when we hear the word of God when something is said that goes against our grain ever had that felt like the cat was being petted the wrong direction didn't like it got mad said I don't know why that preacher has to touch on that don't know why he's got to say stuff like that why don't he just stay in the word we're trying our best to stay right in the word that's what we want we want to stay in the word because we want all of the traditions of men that will not
