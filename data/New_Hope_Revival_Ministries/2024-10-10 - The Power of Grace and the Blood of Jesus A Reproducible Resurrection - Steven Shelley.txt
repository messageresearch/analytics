Description:
In this powerful message, discover the profound truth of Jesus' role not just as God's representative, but as God Himself. Understand the divine mystery of how the Son of God became the Son of Man to redeem fallen humanity. Learn how grace acts as the vehicle, bringing the life-giving power of the blood of Christ to your door. This message explores the balance between grace and the blood, emphasizing that while grace saves, it is the blood that purchased us.

You'll also hear about God's eternal foreknowledge of your life and decisions, the divine plan for your destiny, and how believers will partake in Christ's resurrection life. Dive deep into the spiritual reality that we are part of a reproducible resurrection, one that transforms us from darkness into the glorious light of His truth.

Join us as we unpack these life-changing revelations and reflect on the fullness of redemption through Christ.
