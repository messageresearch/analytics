[1:02] Ziggy welcome I'm just glad to have you
[1:04] here thank you thank you good to be here
[1:05] yeah uh I I'm wishing kick straight off
[1:08] and just uh talk a little bit about your
[1:12] upbringing you're growing up how it was
[1:13] like in Iceland you were born and raised
[1:15] in Iceland and you still live there yeah
[1:17] yeah that's right that's right well um I
[1:19] I grew up in a just a regular family
[1:22] like U my father was an engineer on a on
[1:25] a on a fishing boat so he was quite
[1:28] quite often away when I when I was
[1:29] growing up uh but I I would say I was I
[1:33] grow up in a just a regular loving
[1:34] family um and uh after like in those
[1:40] times it's like when you started to go
[1:42] into the teenage years yeah we didn't
[1:45] have the the cell phones that everyone
[1:47] just seems to be able to just stay at
[1:49] home and do nothing yeah U when we were
[1:52] growing up it's like you were always
[1:54] outside you were always finding
[1:57] something to do and and often it was
[1:59] something that you we're not supposed to
[2:00] be doing so U that was like I would say
[2:04] my my my teenager were quite adventurous
[2:07] um and um like also not in a good way
[2:12] maybe but you started uh partying pretty
[2:16] early uh and that for me a little bit
[2:19] grew out of control so going into my my
[2:24] like early 20s you say early 20s so
[2:28] that's around 21 22 correct yes sir yeah
[2:30] yeah so uh I would say that I would I
[2:35] would have I had to developed a problem
[2:38] with with with with drinking and and
[2:41] drugs and stuff like that so uh
[2:45] but I was um if I would just go from
[2:49] that into how I got saved yeah um is
[2:54] like I was I was in I was in a place in
[2:59] in
[3:00] it's like near the airport in Iceland uh
[3:03] where they had like this place you could
[3:06] go like similar to a rehab but it was
[3:08] faith-based okay so they had meetings
[3:11] there
[3:12] and and I was I was like uh that going
[3:17] there like and the first first
[3:20] like experience was like this is not for
[3:23] me you I said this is good for you but
[3:25] it's not good for me so but like
[3:30] before that uh if I would go like a
[3:33] little bit into there was a moment in
[3:35] time for me that um during my like
[3:40] teenage
[3:41] years um that the spirit realm opened up
[3:44] to me like it was it it's like in a in a
[3:48] way like I can just tell you how it
[3:50] started I was laying in bed and the all
[3:55] of a sudden like this was early morning
[3:59] um I don't remember if I had been
[4:01] partying or what but there appeared a
[4:05] spirit being inside the room and I could
[4:07] see it as clearly as I see you and I
[4:09] just I just freaked out and I I I I
[4:12] start started talking to it I said who
[4:15] are you what are you doing in this room
[4:17] what what are you doing here and in in
[4:19] the in the beginning it didn't didn't
[4:21] start to mind me um I I went out my I
[4:25] like I had a girlfriend there at that
[4:27] moment I ran I ran in into the like the
[4:30] living room and called her and I come
[4:33] come into my room and I said do you see
[4:35] this person here and she said no what
[4:38] are you talking about there is a person
[4:40] standing here I'm not you were still
[4:42] looking at it yeah I I went out to the
[4:43] room I came back in and it was still
[4:45] there it was like not like a like a
[4:48] something that you might see like doing
[4:50] if you're intoxicated something like
[4:52] that but if you go out and you come back
[4:54] in it's still there
[4:58] so
[5:00] and I didn't know what to do really it
[5:02] it was it was not leaving then I then I
[5:05] I started I continued interacting with
[5:06] it and it looked at me and it gave me
[5:09] the finger and I I freaked out I I I I I
[5:13] went to I went to bed and and I tried to
[5:16] just close my eyes thinking I was going
[5:18] crazy and then I then I looked and
[5:21] checked it was still there wow and and
[5:25] um at that moment I looked I I I was
[5:28] laying in bed on the side I I I turned
[5:31] up and I looked up and there was like a
[5:34] black like a black SP like a demon or or
[5:36] an angel or something above me and it
[5:39] flew inside of me wow and and now how
[5:43] old would you have been I would say I
[5:45] was around around 18 maybe 90 there and
[5:48] then I really freaked
[5:49] out and at that moment for the for for
[5:53] for a long time after that that realm
[5:56] was open to me and I could see like I
[5:59] could see see like demons and I could
[6:02] see things inside of rooms that were
[6:05] harassing me and like in the beginning I
[6:09] was afraid but then I wasn't saved then
[6:11] at this moment so I just started
[6:13] experimenting with it so I was saying to
[6:16] other people do you see do you see this
[6:18] do you see that over there I was tell
[6:20] pointing to different things like dark
[6:23] dark things and and even like people
[6:26] like sometimes it was just like Spirits
[6:28] spirits of people
[6:29] yeah who were standing and they didn't
[6:33] mind me at all they they didn't even
[6:34] think about me I was looking maybe two
[6:36] people were standing looking at a
[6:38] picture or or seemed to be just talking
[6:41] W so it was pretty it was a was a pretty
[6:44] um profound experience and it end like
[6:48] it ended like um that I would like I
[6:52] remember one time I was in a hotel room
[6:54] I stood against a like a spirit like I
[6:57] told you I started experimenting with it
[7:00] and I stood and I put my hands like
[7:03] towards a spirit being and it put and it
[7:06] stood and put his hands upon me and we
[7:08] were pushing it pushing other and I
[7:10] could feel he could push me back crazy
[7:13] yeah so that's that was and um so if we
[7:17] fast forward a little
[7:19] bit um I am at that at that
[7:23] place where I told you about where
[7:25] people were praising yeah yeah people
[7:26] were praising God and and and I I I
[7:30] remember they offered me into into the
[7:32] room uh you don't you want to pray a
[7:34] little bit with us I went and sat down
[7:37] and and and I stood up pretty quickly
[7:39] said no this is not for me so up until
[7:42] that point you really had no like
[7:45] connection or like religious like
[7:49] upbringing or background or anything
[7:51] this was kind of your first step in yeah
[7:55] well I had like just this like iel is a
[7:58] Christian like has this Christian
[8:01] Foundation okay so I I I knew the The
[8:05] Lord's Prayer and I I I remember I had
[8:08] sometimes like recited that prayer but I
[8:11] didn't have any I didn't have any like I
[8:14] hadn't gone to church on a regular basis
[8:16] or anything like that but that evening
[8:19] when I go into my room after I leave
[8:21] that small prayer group in that uh in
[8:23] that in that play in that rehab place I
[8:26] go into my room and once again uh late
[8:30] at night I see a black figure like and
[8:33] it was like more powerful than I have
[8:35] seen before it was like standing in the
[8:37] corner of the room and it was like
[8:39] sucking energy into it it's like
[8:41] standing there and just like it was like
[8:43] almost like it was alive like wow yeah
[8:46] and um like it was alive I believe but
[8:49] it was like it was all like moving it
[8:52] was very very it was a like a pretty
[8:55] pretty strange experience and at that
[8:58] moment laying in bad I looked up and I
[9:00] said God if you are real can you help me
[9:05] wow and uh that at that moment the I
[9:08] could see like it the the it was like
[9:11] the spirit realm opened and there came a
[9:14] light into the room I could s with my
[9:17] and uh I didn't I didn't know what to
[9:19] say I didn't know who God was I didn't
[9:22] know how to praise him I didn't know
[9:23] what to say so I just started to praise
[9:26] I praise you God I praise you I think
[9:29] you help I help can you help me and the
[9:32] light started moving inside the room and
[9:34] I could almost like I almost witnessed
[9:37] how the Lord just was like fighting for
[9:40] my soul and just winning My Soul at that
[9:42] time yeah and all during the night uh I
[9:48] was like experiencing this and I had a
[9:51] new testament just like like a small
[9:53] like not the whole Bible yeah and I
[9:56] started reading I started reading like
[9:58] just the first page
[10:00] some something drew me to that and I
[10:03] remember when I was reading it it was
[10:04] like light came over it's like it's
[10:07] doubled you you can when you read one
[10:09] you you always have like two like
[10:11] sections on the page there came light
[10:13] over one section as soon as I moved to
[10:15] the other one I could see the other one
[10:17] damp and the other one light up like it
[10:19] was alive and and while I was reading I
[10:22] could hear like almost like flies like
[10:25] trying to buz and like distract me so it
[10:28] was was a pretty pretty um like an
[10:32] experience you never forget for sure
[10:34] yeah so I mean something as real as that
[10:37] is yeah so that was that was and I read
[10:40] the I read I think almost the the whole
[10:42] book of
[10:43] Matthew uh that night and I could just I
[10:47] I I I it was like I was living the story
[10:51] I could like see myself with Jesus and
[10:53] the disciples and just like almost like
[10:55] I was walking with them I was just that
[10:57] they came so much alive to me wow and
[11:00] then next morning like the guy who went
[11:02] into the prayer room and said no this is
[11:04] not for me I was running the hall and
[11:08] say I I I I'm saved I'm saved and
[11:12] everyone just looking at me but what
[11:14] happened to this guy and I told them I
[11:16] told them what happened and it it was
[11:18] pretty amazing so that really that was
[11:20] the moment where you really got saved
[11:22] yeah was right there so you were still
[11:24] in your early 20s right yeah W I would
[11:27] say I was probably around 20
[11:29] it was in 2002 okay so I'm 21 wow 21
[11:35] that's amazing yeah I mean just an an
[11:38] like I said experience like that you can
[11:39] never forget something like that that no
[11:42] that that changed that changed a lot I I
[11:45] still had I still
[11:48] had like I was my old self but then now
[11:53] after I got out of the rehab I had all
[11:55] my old friends I had everything but I
[11:57] had this experience but I didn't
[11:59] basically have anyone to like fellowship
[12:02] with or or or go with me on this route
[12:05] so yeah so I just went back to my old
[12:08] friends and and and even if I even if I
[12:11] had that profound experience I still
[12:14] still like went back to do some of the
[12:16] old things but I did but the the
[12:18] difference now was when I maybe went
[12:20] into a party or something you experience
[12:23] kind of like and and then maybe I went
[12:25] to the bathroom I could not look myself
[12:27] in the mirror yeah I like I always
[12:30] stayed in the back of your head kind of
[12:32] just like no I I now I knew that he was
[12:35] watching me yeah he could see what I was
[12:37] doing and I knew it so I had a hard time
[12:39] watching myself I'm sure yeah and so but
[12:44] like it it was like U not long after I
[12:49] got saved that I met
[12:50] Hawk and and you of course yeah yeah and
[12:55] um I had been there um going to to a
[13:00] church which is called Crossing in
[13:02] Iceland and that
[13:05] uh that was like yeah we went we went
[13:08] together to like like a small seminar
[13:11] that they call uh an alpha seminar where
[13:14] where you go into the basics of the
[13:16] Bible and U then he also HW was working
[13:20] at Omega stasan and then with Eric and
[13:24] was helping a little bit with production
[13:26] there and starting to work there a
[13:27] little bit and I was in crin and what
[13:31] changed everything for me I had been
[13:33] there at that time I'm not I'm not sure
[13:36] how many years I was saved maybe 3 years
[13:38] or something like that um and I had been
[13:41] going to this church and I started we
[13:43] started to read the Bible but there was
[13:46] something missing that's that's the
[13:47] reason that probably I fell again
[13:51] because I was I was reading something in
[13:54] the Bible and what I was seeing in the
[13:56] churches I was going uh it didn't match
[13:59] what I was reading in the Bible yeah for
[14:01] sure so there I I and and in my thinking
[14:05] was like is this all there is like and
[14:09] and it wasn't enough for me yeah to
[14:11] sustain me you could say and then Hawk
[14:15] uh at one moment I remember he told me
[14:20] about a a person uh called William
[14:25] Brandon and gave me a a live story about
[14:28] that that that that that brother and
[14:31] when I started reading reading that I
[14:34] could it changed everything for me I
[14:36] could see hey this is the same guy this
[14:38] is the same God I'm reading in the Bible
[14:41] which is working through that person
[14:43] yeah it's not like just emotions and and
[14:45] and singing and running it was something
[14:48] real um so that changed a lot for me and
[14:54] that really turned my faith on fire and
[14:57] I started going in into U into Ministry
[15:00] my so um and I like I know the
[15:05] transition was probably around
[15:08] 200 7 67 then HW is moving here to you
[15:13] guys and God gave me a dream um that
[15:20] this was before I even knew he was
[15:21] moving here i' I went to Haw one day and
[15:24] I told HW I had a dream uh that I was
[15:28] going to work at
[15:29] Omega and hog told me yeah that's pretty
[15:33] amazing because uh I'm I'm moving I'm
[15:36] going away from here what a way to tell
[15:38] you yeah so uh so I that basically was a
[15:42] confirmation because when he came here I
[15:44] took I I took his job and started
[15:46] working at the Omega Channel um as a
[15:49] technician to help him with recording
[15:52] programs and stuff like that and started
[15:55] to taking my first steps into Ministry
[15:58] so
[15:59] and that just started with a website I
[16:01] started with a website started making
[16:02] articles and and um and then it
[16:07] progressed into making like programs
[16:10] television programs uh for the Omega
[16:13] channel was I was sitting and teaching
[16:15] out of the word and then it progressed
[16:18] into having like a small group that I
[16:20] like LED or
[16:23] ped um that was for for a few years and
[16:28] so that is like uh how my like the
[16:32] progression of being saved yeah and and
[16:35] how the first
[16:37] like uh sat bags and going going to find
[16:40] my place you could say um with the Lord
[16:44] and and in and what I believe was his
[16:46] will for me at that time and
[16:50] so yeah that's quite quite quite like
[16:53] this is like the first part we could say
[16:55] yeah um in in the in this uh progress I
[17:00] I met my wife um and we got married and
[17:05] had kids and I like I started to get
[17:09] pressure like we had we we had at that
[17:12] Mo time maybe around 2009 we had two
[17:16] kids we came here like the whole family
[17:19] couple of times couple of times or
[17:21] something like that and I got like the
[17:25] pressure started to to try to go and and
[17:28] get some better work and get like so so
[17:31] I would be able to better support my
[17:32] family and things like that so at a PO
[17:35] at a moment in time I started studying
[17:38] to be an air traffic
[17:39] controller and and went into that and
[17:43] studied that and was even like picked
[17:45] out of a big group to go and and and and
[17:47] train to handle air traffics air traffic
[17:51] over C airport and stayed there for one
[17:53] year
[17:57] so so that is like if we could
[18:00] say the the beginning of at like going
[18:06] into that and staying there for a year
[18:08] then we could say I'm I'm going to go
[18:10] into the beginning of the of the pruning
[18:12] or training process like the like when
[18:16] the Lord starts to like work really work
[18:19] the Deep work and start pulling things
[18:21] out of our
[18:22] lives
[18:24] and I'm staying there and the day before
[18:27] I'm going to get my degree to be like a
[18:30] certified traffic controller and work
[18:33] there and something happens like the day
[18:36] the day before I'm going to the test and
[18:39] I make an I make a mistake some kind
[18:42] somehow I make a mistake and they kick
[18:44] me out wow the day before that that was
[18:47] like a a probably it's like two or three
[18:51] year process of going through school
[18:53] learning everything finishing all the
[18:55] exams being picked and going for one
[18:57] year training and and that all of a
[19:00] sudden yeah it's done and and that I
[19:03] mean that had to be hard yeah it was
[19:05] hard because I mean you know you just
[19:07] like you said went through schooling a
[19:09] year of training and one little mistake
[19:11] and that's it yeah yeah so yeah that's
[19:14] basically it uh but it's like afterwards
[19:18] thinking back because often in the
[19:20] moment you cannot see what is happening
[19:21] but the Lord shows sees everything he
[19:24] knows exactly what what he's doing and
[19:26] and I believe it's like I believe for me
[19:29] it's like he is the alpha omega he knows
[19:32] the beginning from the end he knows all
[19:34] the choices we make he knows everything
[19:37] that we are going to do our mistakes our
[19:40] setbacks and he uses it all to perfect
[19:43] us
[19:44] so but it was hard that was a hard
[19:47] moment and and it was also hard on my
[19:49] wife because she had like expectations
[19:52] of like I was going to be the air
[19:54] traffic controller and we going to have
[19:56] this kind of life and it's like
[19:58] everything is taken down yeah
[20:02] and uh after that
[20:06] uh things start to get a little bit
[20:09] tough and like I'm not in any sure like
[20:13] I'm not basically in any Ministry at
[20:16] that moment I had I had pulled out a
[20:18] little bit I'm going to maybe meetings
[20:20] and some stuff like that just by
[20:22] myself but I'm always through all of all
[20:26] of this I'm always praying and I always
[20:28] have my Bible I always read but
[20:30] sometimes
[20:31] like sometimes it's like I'm on I have
[20:35] this like fire sometimes I'm a little
[20:37] bit lukewarm just this process so this
[20:40] is
[20:41] a when this is finished like going into
[20:44] this study of the air traffic
[20:46] controlling is like probably around
[20:50] 200 10 10 11 something like that and
[20:54] it's like like just like that it's
[20:56] finished around 2
[21:00] I would say I'm not I'm not 100% of the
[21:02] years but it doesn't matter so around
[21:05] 200 14 15
[21:08] probably uh and then that is the same
[21:11] moment like I think 2013 I'm pulling out
[21:14] of my like pastoral job with this group
[21:17] and yeah and going we move move to
[21:22] SOS and there uh at
[21:26] SOS I just take a regular job start
[21:29] building up my own
[21:31] businesses and
[21:33] um have this I have this advertisement
[21:37] agent businesses today which is like
[21:39] have been going for many years and doing
[21:41] doing good I always have I have have
[21:43] good clients and things like that but I
[21:45] also went into other things I went into
[21:47] building houses and Selling Houses just
[21:50] like a just trying to be a regular guy
[21:52] basically just trying to whatever yeah
[21:55] just trying to to to support my family
[21:57] well and
[21:58] but it was like it was like Jonah I was
[22:03] like Jonah and it doesn't really matter
[22:06] what I was trying to do it was always
[22:09] some storm following
[22:11] me just uh taking that first house that
[22:14] I decided to build um just a a a pile of
[22:20] problems just the house when I was
[22:22] finished with the house which like uh
[22:25] took around 6 seven months I imported it
[22:28] from lith
[22:30] Lithuania I found out it was in the
[22:32] wrong place on the
[22:33] plot and and that was a major problem
[22:37] and I had to take it out of Sal out of
[22:39] sales and and I had to work on some
[22:43] changes and trying to get that approved
[22:45] uh when that was finished it was already
[22:47] winter time uh at one one moment I I got
[22:51] a phone call then the roof was like
[22:53] ripping off of the of the house because
[22:55] of winds and and flying out out out of
[22:59] the house and it was like like when are
[23:01] this when is this going to stop yeah it
[23:04] just one thing after another yeah and
[23:05] then we was able to fix that uh a few
[23:08] weeks later probably two weeks later I
[23:10] got another call the the roof was again
[23:12] ripping off the house so it was like
[23:15] just a row of things that that just kept
[23:18] happening over and over yeah and when I
[23:20] was seeking the Lord he was giving me
[23:23] Jonah and basically he was saying it
[23:27] like the storm is following you everyone
[23:30] that you will come in contact with and
[23:32] that will be as like in your circle of
[23:34] business or whatever they will be
[23:37] affected by this storm so the guys who
[23:39] who built the foundation they they like
[23:42] I probably built like thousands of
[23:44] Foundations but building it for me it
[23:46] was in the wrong place and just so that
[23:49] was that was like
[23:51] one like I I would say like through this
[23:55] process of trying to go my own way
[23:58] like not following after my calling and
[24:02] just trying to be a regular guy yeah the
[24:05] Lord he he works a work on you a deep
[24:07] work and he gives you like hints like
[24:10] that like hey this is not what you're
[24:13] supposed to be doing for sure it's not
[24:14] working very well what you're trying to
[24:16] doing in your own self
[24:19] so so during that uh time I also like
[24:24] finished that house finally and uh
[24:28] me and my family me and my wife decid to
[24:32] sell the place in cell phones and buy a
[24:34] new
[24:35] place uh and we do that and soon after
[24:39] moving in like when we're just starting
[24:42] to move I start to noticing some things
[24:44] about that house um it started to leak a
[24:48] little bit under the window and I like I
[24:52] started to check a little bit more and I
[24:53] opened up the like the roof and I I took
[24:57] down the insul ation it just poured
[24:59] water from inside out inside the house
[25:02] so and it it came apparent that this
[25:05] house was just it was so badly built uh
[25:11] that it was like you the the easiest
[25:14] part would have been to take it down
[25:16] just and start over again yeah and that
[25:19] during that it was like one year of like
[25:22] going back and forth with the guys who
[25:25] sold us the house arguing trying to find
[25:28] a solution uh and in the end uh I was
[25:34] like fighting it because like this this
[25:36] is a house that that I wanted yeah and
[25:39] then and during like after a year of
[25:44] like going through that
[25:46] Valley
[25:48] I I asked the Lord about it and he told
[25:52] me to give it up so I said okay if you
[25:54] want to pay for this if you want to pay
[25:56] back you can get the the house and they
[25:59] agreed to do that um and after that
[26:02] there was another house that we bought
[26:04] like a during that time like while we
[26:08] were waiting for this year of conflict
[26:10] to
[26:11] finish and I was uh pretty happy with
[26:15] the how that came out but then we bought
[26:17] another house which was like like not
[26:20] finished just the outside and I had to
[26:23] finish that house and when I finished
[26:25] that house then that was not uh good
[26:27] enough so we bought another house so
[26:30] this has been the last few years for me
[26:32] it's like just one thing after it one
[26:34] thing after after another
[26:36] and so that has been uh a very hard and
[26:40] and and difficult like experience for me
[26:44] and my family of
[26:46] course
[26:48] and yeah so and there is a lot of
[26:50] heartaches through that that face which
[26:53] which has which has brought me to to
[26:57] this place
[26:58] now like it was like the the the main
[27:01] theme of all of it is basically that the
[27:06] Lord was just telling me it will be like
[27:09] this until you come back to me yeah it
[27:11] doesn't matter what you do it it it will
[27:13] be like this and but I'm a pretty
[27:16] stubborn guy and uh I have a pretty
[27:19] pretty much energy and I I I have this I
[27:23] have this inside of me that if something
[27:25] is not working or broken I I will fix it
[27:28] yeah and and relying then probably more
[27:32] on myself than I should of course
[27:36] um but going if you go a little bit
[27:39] forward
[27:43] uh to this uh like today it's like I'm
[27:48] in a really good place yeah I'm in a
[27:51] really good place now and and now you
[27:54] can kind of look back on all those
[27:55] trials and stuff and realize what the
[27:57] Lord is really doing and working on you
[28:00] yeah and you know that's exciting
[28:02] because now you can see where you are
[28:04] now because of all that yeah it's
[28:06] basically like that but it's been it's
[28:09] been more difficult than I could have
[28:11] ever imagined it's been so it's been so
[28:15] hard and in in in in in part it's still
[28:18] hard yeah because there are like things
[28:22] that that are that are unresolved which
[28:25] are which have been very difficult like
[28:27] big like hard
[28:29] rejections uh sadness bitterness angers
[28:33] that have come up from all of that so
[28:38] but going like uh looking back it's like
[28:44] you start to
[28:45] see the like you said the work of the
[28:48] Lord yeah
[28:50] and it's like I have a verse in Luke
[28:54] 1733 it says whoever shall seek to save
[28:56] his life shall lose it and whoever shall
[29:00] lose his life shall preserve it amen and
[29:04] it's like in this process I can tell
[29:08] you there was some times that was were
[29:12] really dark and there was actually put
[29:14] like two times that I screamed at the
[29:16] Lord take me from this place take me
[29:19] from this Earth I don't want to be here
[29:21] anymore and then I was I had I had come
[29:25] I had come to the end of myself I had
[29:29] lost a lot of money I had like there was
[29:32] difficulties in in my family there was
[29:35] there was so deep heartaches that I I
[29:37] was just I was at the an I didn't want
[29:39] to continue yeah but it was like it's a
[29:43] strange like also a strange testimony
[29:45] there because as soon as I screamed I
[29:48] was driving my car I screamed at the
[29:50] Lord and I meant it from all my heart
[29:52] take me from this place I don't want to
[29:54] be here one second more and
[29:58] after I screamed that like things
[30:01] started to to to to be to be better it
[30:04] was almost like the Lord said okay I'll
[30:07] give you I I'll give you some relief now
[30:10] and and things started to to be better
[30:14] yeah after that
[30:15] moment
[30:17] and I have
[30:20] uh I have uh let's
[30:25] say yeah I'm trying I'm trying to
[30:27] transition into like the second phase
[30:29] yeah yeah trying to I I like you can
[30:32] maybe sense that I I'm I'm trying to
[30:35] find how deep shall I go it's totally
[30:38] it's totally up to you yeah yeah so um
[30:43] so I I don't know how how how far I want
[30:45] to go down to it but I could say like I
[30:48] could say that it has brought me to a
[30:51] place that I have
[30:54] felt like the biggest sinner
[30:57] no like seeing all the things that the
[30:59] Lord had showed me and done for me and
[31:02] coming to a place like Paul said like
[31:04] just I experience yourself as the
[31:06] biggest sinner yeah and and and seeing
[31:10] then after all of that thing all of
[31:13] those things all of those mistakes all
[31:15] of those
[31:17] heartaches that it was really the Lord
[31:20] all all the time like through everything
[31:22] it was the Lord taking out of myself the
[31:26] self
[31:28] and and helping me to come to the place
[31:31] that like I
[31:33] said I'm ready to lose my life I I I
[31:37] screamed at him to take
[31:39] it and then maybe you will start to in
[31:43] my opinion become
[31:45] qualified so he can come in and live his
[31:47] life through you so that's my basically
[31:50] my prayer today is like when I pray I'm
[31:53] I pray to take over and there is nothing
[31:57] here that that that is basically holding
[31:59] me that I would like to pursue now I try
[32:03] I try to P pursue a lot of things going
[32:06] to that air traffic controlling uh
[32:09] trying to start my own businesses and
[32:11] trying to expand that make money and do
[32:14] well in business all of that means
[32:17] nothing to me now nothing it it's like
[32:20] it it gave me only heartache it gave me
[32:22] no no no like maybe you have like a
[32:26] small like glimpses of of happiness you
[32:30] think you're doing well and like it
[32:32] builds your pride but it's like looking
[32:34] back it it it's it's worthless to me
[32:37] yeah doesn't mean anything and like when
[32:38] I think when you get you can like
[32:40] finally like get to that point I mean
[32:42] everybody get to that point in life and
[32:44] like realize that like yeah none of it
[32:47] is none of it none of anything here
[32:49] really matters yeah like it's you know
[32:52] everything you can do is for the Lord
[32:54] yeah uh and like you like you were
[32:56] saying I think I also said on Hulk when
[32:58] I did one of these with Hawke like I had
[33:01] to realize that same thing about like
[33:03] fully surrendering to the Lord because
[33:05] like I was going through tons of stuff
[33:07] in my life nothing you know nothing like
[33:08] yours but like going through my own
[33:09] trial yeah of course and uh and like I
[33:13] kept like hearing different things like
[33:15] you know people TR to be like remember
[33:17] you know just hold on and you know you
[33:19] got to fully surrender and all that and
[33:20] I was like you know I am I'm coming to
[33:22] church every service I'm worshiping I'm
[33:24] listening to preaching what more do you
[33:25] want me to do like you I thought I was
[33:27] doing everything I needed to do and I
[33:30] ended up having a conversation with Hawk
[33:31] and RJ one day and they something that
[33:35] they both had said that helped me they
[33:36] were like you know you got to start
[33:38] preparing for what's going to come to
[33:40] pass like it you're plan right now may
[33:43] not be working out but it could in the
[33:46] future and so you have to start prepared
[33:47] so like I uh I got touched in one of the
[33:50] services uh a couple months ago and I
[33:53] realized from like that point okay I
[33:55] wasn't doing near enough to fully
[33:57] surrender to the Lord and as soon as I
[33:59] realized that like like personally
[34:01] realized that I was not doing near
[34:03] enough to fully surrender everything
[34:05] started falling into PL you know I
[34:07] started helping leading the service and
[34:09] then this podcast thing was laid on my
[34:11] heart and immediately I was like okay
[34:13] this is going to be my form of ministry
[34:15] to get people on here to tell their
[34:17] testimonies to tell what the Lord's
[34:18] doing in their lives to be able to you
[34:20] know we're so blessed to be able to have
[34:22] this yeah and to be able to you know put
[34:24] these out because it's I mean it's reach
[34:27] so many different people yeah and so
[34:29] like as soon as I realized I had to
[34:30] fully surrender everything just started
[34:33] working out perfect and you know it's
[34:35] it's been amazing just to watch you know
[34:37] just everything bad bad it's great um
[34:40] but I do want to ask you this just
[34:42] backtrack when did you meet did you meet
[34:46] dad be I mean you met Dad when what year
[34:49] do you
[34:50] remember uh I came here I met I met him
[34:54] first here okay you did okay yeah I came
[34:56] here with HW I don't remember exactly
[34:59] the year it was like at the same in the
[35:01] same time he was getting married okay
[35:03] all right so just just just a little
[35:04] after that and yeah I met him and and I
[35:07] I I think this is probably my sixth or
[35:10] seventh wi or something I remember you
[35:12] coming with the family a lot like when I
[35:14] was younger cuz we would always play
[35:15] soccer yeah I think probably probably
[35:17] totally total has been maybe five six
[35:20] seven times now what is the story about
[35:23] the B baptizing people in the prison
[35:26] yeah I do want to hear about that yeah
[35:28] well I was uh I was staying in in in in
[35:32] in a place out of outside of Iceland and
[35:36] um I had to stay there for eight months
[35:38] uh and I was I was in a good place then
[35:42] I was like I already been saved and I
[35:44] was uh I was uh reading my Bible and
[35:48] praying and and I was testifying to
[35:52] these inmates at at that place and at
[35:54] one moment like uh Haw and your father
[35:58] and and and Eric Sigerson and Magnuson
[36:02] and some of the brothers came to visit
[36:05] and and gooder and of course we are we
[36:08] arranged a b like a baptizing service
[36:11] then in the in the ice cold ocean and
[36:14] and baptized probably around three or
[36:17] four guys there wow so that that was
[36:19] nice that was nice it was a nice place
[36:22] and have a golf course and a nice gym
[36:24] and everything so so yeah that's that's
[36:28] that that that is like that was very
[36:31] that was that was a nice time and I
[36:33] would I would like to add one testimony
[36:35] also which is like pretty powerful uh
[36:39] when I was uh when I was uh meeting like
[36:44] when I was meeting my wife in the
[36:46] beginning like there
[36:48] was there was like an ex-boyfriend which
[36:52] was like pretty pretty intense VI
[36:55] violent guy and and they he was like uh
[36:59] he was threatening me on a daily basis
[37:02] like we were talking about real threats
[37:04] and a guy who who who who who like who
[37:07] who if he promises to do something he
[37:09] does it yeah
[37:12] and I started uh in that moment I was
[37:15] already in omea we were going to
[37:17] meetings and me and HW and and I started
[37:21] praying into it because basically what I
[37:24] I I knew about this when I was when I
[37:26] was meeting my wife for the first time I
[37:28] knew about this guy and and no one no
[37:32] one wanted to do anything like to get on
[37:35] the bad side of that person but somehow
[37:37] inside of me I knew that I had a God
[37:41] that was bigger than anything and I did
[37:44] it and then I started going into this
[37:46] like getting these threats and
[37:48] everything for a long time and and the
[37:51] Lord kept bringing me to the Book of
[37:53] Joshua and and this is like a i I will
[37:56] never forget it because it's such a
[37:58] powerful testimony for myself and he
[38:01] gave me the vers 8 and N the the book of
[38:05] the law shall not depart out of the out
[38:07] of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate
[38:10] therein day and night that thou mayest
[38:12] observe to do according to all that is
[38:14] written therein for then Thou shalt make
[38:17] thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt
[38:19] have good
[38:20] success have I not commanded thee be
[38:23] strong and of good courage be not afraid
[38:26] neither be thou dismayed for the Lord
[38:29] thy God is with thee where with with
[38:31] there soever thou goest goest and he
[38:35] gave me this on on three different
[38:37] occasions when I when when I think we
[38:40] remember when the threats are were
[38:42] probably the most most
[38:44] severe and in the end like at that
[38:47] moment that that person was in prison so
[38:50] he he was not able to to make good on
[38:54] his threats yeah but then the came a
[38:56] time when he was go going to be
[38:59] released and uh at that moment just a
[39:03] few weeks before I got a phone call from
[39:07] we had a like a a um I had a friend
[39:10] which was also like a good friend of his
[39:12] okay so he was often like meeting like
[39:15] like telling me some info and I got this
[39:18] like this offer to pay like amount of
[39:22] money to and if I would pay the amount
[39:25] of money
[39:27] I I would only have both my arms broken
[39:29] nothing more so not a good offer
[39:33] really and uh I like as soon as I got
[39:38] that offer the Lord brought to my mind
[39:41] mind the story of the king I'm not uh I
[39:44] didn't I didn't look it up the story of
[39:46] the king which had trusted the Lord when
[39:49] when the Nations around were coming in
[39:52] to attack and he was see he he he he
[39:55] sought the Lord
[39:57] and the lord gave him victory over those
[39:59] kings or nations but then at a later
[40:04] stage he got he got
[40:08] another like there was a brewing another
[40:11] attack and at that moment that King
[40:14] instead of trusting the Lord he decided
[40:17] to to to ask a fellow King for help and
[40:22] sought the help of another king to to go
[40:26] against these nations or these kings
[40:28] that were attacking and because he did
[40:31] not tress the Lord 100% he lost and was
[40:35] killed and the Lord brought that story
[40:37] to my mind and so I was like that it was
[40:42] like the enemy handed me if you pay then
[40:44] it would be okay so then I would be
[40:46] starting to agreeing with him instead of
[40:48] God and trusting that he would be with
[40:51] me in everything that I where where
[40:53] wherever I go so I said no and and the
[40:57] time came that this guy came out and we
[41:00] got the phone call uh to come and meet
[41:04] him um at that moment there was like a
[41:06] small Revival in Iceland like people in
[41:09] drugs were getting saved and a friend of
[41:12] of of that guy was the leader of that
[41:14] movement wow
[41:16] Baler and and he came was was hosting a
[41:21] meeting and this like this guy had like
[41:26] got in a touch of the Lord and was going
[41:30] to his meetings and he asked me to come
[41:33] and when I came I just went in faith
[41:35] yeah didn't know what to expect what
[41:37] would happen uh and he greeted me kindly
[41:41] and we went to the meeting and like
[41:44] after maybe when when the meeting was
[41:46] finished the preaching was finished um
[41:50] balder calls the guy his friend to come
[41:53] up and go on his knees and ask me to
[41:56] pray over him wow so so going from like
[42:00] that that's that's that's a real
[42:02] testimony of the power of God if you
[42:04] trust him he will bring your enemies to
[42:06] his to your Le so and wow so that's a
[42:10] powerful one but that I just wanted to
[42:12] add it because it shows the faithfulness
[42:14] of the Lord that's and he has protected
[42:16] protected us ever since and and been
[42:19] been very very kind kind is that guy
[42:22] still doing like good like serving the
[42:24] lord and stuff or I'm not sure where
[42:26] where he is today no but I don't think
[42:28] so but I pray for him I pray for him um
[42:32] so that is that is one thing but the
[42:35] hardest part if if you go back to the
[42:37] story and going through this training
[42:39] process I I look I see it now that the
[42:42] Lord has been working a deep work in me
[42:44] through all of that there like if you
[42:47] just look at you look at some of the you
[42:49] just it's like the same with the Bible
[42:51] and the stories of of Our Heroes it's
[42:54] like job and David and all all of these
[42:57] Heroes they they get a touch of the Lord
[43:00] maybe and they're serving the lord but
[43:01] then there's something that comes that
[43:03] just brings them all so far down because
[43:06] Lord is going to bring them up and do
[43:08] something even greater as later States
[43:11] but the hardest part of all of this has
[43:13] been dealing with with the rejection uh
[43:15] the anger and the bitterness of of of
[43:20] what has happened in like in my family
[43:23] and and through all of this heartaches
[43:25] with everything that happened with with
[43:27] the with the with air traffic
[43:29] controlling that had effect on everyone
[43:31] and and so forth but I have I I feel
[43:36] that I have won the victory over that
[43:38] just re not not so far far far back so
[43:43] and the the the Turning Point really
[43:46] was um that I I was like looking into
[43:50] the fall Feast like the fall Feast now
[43:53] in this this year
[43:55] 2023 and I was like teaching in my home
[43:58] group uh I had started like we had all I
[44:01] had I had I didn't did we go into the
[44:03] home group that I had no we didn't go
[44:05] into that no yeah no we haven't yet yeah
[44:07] you said that was going to be for the
[44:08] second phase that you're doing now yeah
[44:10] yeah so basically through some of this
[44:12] these hard years it's like this hard uh
[44:15] period time period was basically 7 years
[44:19] it's like it was basically from 2015 to
[44:22] two until
[44:24] 2022 that I was going through that like
[44:27] low season is like the seasons of the
[44:29] Lord like you have good SE like good
[44:31] seven years and bad Seven Years or or
[44:34] famine and and and
[44:36] prosperity so basically it was seven
[44:40] years and and another thing which I have
[44:43] told to HW um like I think I think
[44:48] probably like not being like 100%
[44:51] certain but the Lord started to show me
[44:53] the number
[44:54] 22 just
[44:56] on a consistent basis I was seeing it
[44:59] everywhere and I think it started
[45:01] 2015 huh so I was seeing it everywhere I
[45:05] was seeing it I was waking up at 2:22 I
[45:08] was I was like driving always driving
[45:11] after a car and there came a car with 22
[45:14] uh it was everywhere for and I I was
[45:16] asking what is this number what is this
[45:18] number but I I believe now it was Lord
[45:21] the showing me that it would be finished
[45:23] in 2022 yeah so
[45:28] but so uh where where were I you're
[45:32] talking you're about to talk about your
[45:33] home group yeah so yeah seven years of
[45:37] that and going through all of that is
[45:39] like I was starting I I yes I know where
[45:43] where it's going now we I still kept uh
[45:48] touch like with only of course Hawk and
[45:51] and and and like hwk knows all my
[45:54] stories and but we were meeting trying
[45:56] to meet in in the home group a few
[45:58] Brothers maybe three four brothers um
[46:02] like having hard times like and trying
[46:04] to just still trying to be a faithful in
[46:07] meeting and doing something and and
[46:11] after after like in like in 2022 I was
[46:15] telling you about um um I started to
[46:18] just feel I'm waking up again like all
[46:22] of that heartache all of those things
[46:24] that had happened with the business
[46:25] businesses losing money and everything I
[46:28] was just completely broken beaten down
[46:32] and like I told you just please take me
[46:35] from here I I can't go any further um
[46:38] after that things started to brighten up
[46:40] and I believe then probably uh I hope
[46:43] that was the last of last of the hard
[46:46] the hard very hard stuff um but you
[46:49] could say like no trials no testimony
[46:52] for sure I've been dealing with I've
[46:53] been dealing with a lot of things and I
[46:55] believe I've had like overcoming
[46:58] bitterness is probably one of the
[47:00] hardest thing that I've that had to
[47:02] overcome and dealing with the spirits of
[47:05] these worlds the spirit of Jezebel which
[47:07] is now prominent almost everywhere see
[47:10] it's like in families in churches in in
[47:14] societies um and like going to the like
[47:18] going I was reading before I came here
[47:20] this morning I was reading like the
[47:22] story of Elijah like and it just show
[47:25] the two phases of his life as well he's
[47:27] like light says this prophet of God
[47:30] which is like he is experiencing amazing
[47:33] things the Lord is he leads him to to
[47:37] the Mount Carmel Showdown and he he like
[47:40] he slays all the false prophets uh and
[47:44] and the Lord just brings fire on his
[47:47] offering yeah and then he it's like he
[47:49] gets a phone call from Jezebel like with
[47:51] a threat and he just fle so afraid and
[47:55] just tell the Lord just I I just want to
[47:57] die Elijah did after seeing going
[48:00] through all of that and the Lord meets
[48:02] him and and and gives him the Victory
[48:05] and leads him into a fast and he goes on
[48:09] a 40-day fast going back to to like
[48:11] through a journey and and and and goes
[48:15] like in the end like Ahab is killed and
[48:18] Jezebel is killed so that story talks a
[48:21] little bit about things things that I've
[48:23] been going through and going out to
[48:26] maybe like a few months back I was
[48:29] studying the fall
[48:30] Feast um and the Lord told me I I
[48:35] believe like it was like lad of the Lord
[48:37] he told me to go into a three-day
[48:39] fast and this was like not so long ago
[48:44] and that 3-day fast changed everything I
[48:48] believe that three-day fast was was the
[48:51] turning point of me uh finally being
[48:55] able to conquer bitterness and anger and
[49:01] and and offer forgiveness for something
[49:03] that I I had been like having this
[49:06] buness and anger for for for this long
[49:08] time
[49:10] so and uh I started
[49:14] teaching like because of the Fall Feast
[49:17] there I I love the Feast of the Lord
[49:18] yeah and and now we're here at this cab
[49:20] meeting during suot which is like
[49:23] profound um but the the the story of the
[49:26] Fall Feast for me is like looking at how
[49:29] the
[49:30] Israelites how they even like are
[49:33] celebrating the feast today it's like
[49:35] Ros hashana they it's like this
[49:39] preparation preparation they they they
[49:41] go even like 40 days in in front of yam
[49:45] kipur to start preparing themselves yeah
[49:48] and the they they they try to take out
[49:51] all the which is like not like all the
[49:54] sour dough and and go through their
[49:56] houses and it's just it's such a
[49:58] beautiful picture so I was reading that
[50:01] and I really like I had like the Lord
[50:03] told me in the last spring I was
[50:07] listening to Sir like to to Pastor
[50:09] stepen s preaching and I felt I needed
[50:13] to be here like the Lord was leading me
[50:15] here and what I wanted to do
[50:19] is I didn't want to just book a flight
[50:22] and then just wait for cam meeting I was
[50:24] going into this and I had I wanted to
[50:27] really prepare myself so I started I
[50:29] started this this fast I started
[50:32] cleaning out my house I started taking
[50:34] out things that I didn't want and I
[50:36] start pre like teaching my home group
[50:38] home group about this and I it was like
[50:41] amazing how many things came up that the
[50:43] Lord started dealing with the hearts of
[50:45] the people and and then leading up to
[50:48] this place here coming here it's like
[50:52] the last couple of months has been
[50:54] amazing
[50:57] uh I would go if I go a little bit
[50:59] farther back as soon as like in 2022 I
[51:02] made the decision to really okay I'm
[51:04] going to serve the Lord again with
[51:07] everything that is in me just making
[51:09] that decision um like it was like almost
[51:13] like like us like like this the Lord
[51:17] like the home group we had been meeting
[51:19] like three four brothers uh we didn't do
[51:22] anything different but all of a sudden
[51:24] the house was full of people
[51:26] just coming from all over from like 25
[51:28] 20 people now yeah like it's like now
[51:32] that it's like on a regular basis it's
[51:34] like the house is just full at all this
[51:35] that's amazing and and it just happened
[51:38] yeah it just happened coming from the
[51:40] East and the and the west and just
[51:42] people coming everywhere and then coming
[51:43] again and again and and so how did a lot
[51:45] of people find out about it just uh it's
[51:49] basically like only met one sister which
[51:53] like was living in sos
[51:56] and told her about our home group so she
[51:58] came and she was so blessed she started
[52:00] telling some of her friends and then
[52:03] they started telling some of their
[52:04] friends and it just it just like grew
[52:07] like like in a few weeks it was this
[52:09] Full House and so that has been such a
[52:13] blessing and it's like uh now it's like
[52:17] even the house is already like to small
[52:20] so a friend of oie she was able to sell
[52:23] her apartment in reic and she is buying
[52:25] a new bigger house already bought it
[52:27] which is just like 5 minutes away which
[52:29] can host a a more a lot more people
[52:32] that's amazing and U then there is like
[52:35] this place uh near o was just telling me
[52:38] before I came here he was meeting a guy
[52:40] who is like the overseer of a place
[52:43] which is hosting people with
[52:47] disabilities and things like that and
[52:48] they have like a chapel or or a big Hall
[52:51] and all was telling me about the home
[52:53] group this guy because he knew knew from
[52:55] the past or something and this guy
[52:57] started to get real excited about all
[53:00] talking about this and he said hey I
[53:02] have I'm I have a chapel here in a Hall
[53:05] you can come and have meetings here wow
[53:07] so that's something that is opening up
[53:09] all also that's amazing it really is
[53:11] yeah so it's like things are happening
[53:13] pretty fast and then and I'm just so
[53:17] blessed and happy to be able to go back
[53:20] into what I believe and I've always
[53:22] believed that I'm supposed to be doing
[53:23] for sure
[53:25] so
[53:27] uh yeah that is that is basically some
[53:31] of some of some of the like my testimony
[53:35] a little bit I mean you know it's
[53:37] definitely amazing to see how God has
[53:39] worked through you and and is still
[53:41] working through you with this home group
[53:42] and with this whole thing um I like to
[53:45] ask people this at the end if you could
[53:49] give any advice to the young people of
[53:52] this you generation nowadays I mean even
[53:54] your kid you you have young kids well I
[53:56] guess I'm probably not young and any
[53:57] more but was just 10 but you know you
[54:01] know kids you know older teenagers young
[54:03] teenag whatever you know just the youth
[54:06] uh what would what would be some
[54:09] spiritual advice that you could give
[54:10] them something that you've learned you
[54:13] know I howte you to put you on the spot
[54:15] that's okay I no problem no problem I
[54:17] just
[54:19] uh for me it's like going through my
[54:22] testimony and my experience is like like
[54:24] a told you before no trials no testimony
[54:28] yeah and if you if you if you never go
[54:31] if you know if you never have to deal
[54:33] with things and and uh and overcome them
[54:38] how are you going to help other people
[54:40] overcome for sure so this is my story no
[54:43] story is the same yeah and so basically
[54:47] I
[54:48] would I would say like if I would look
[54:52] back I probably might have had been able
[54:57] to take some some easier routes if I had
[55:00] just been more sensitive to the voice of
[55:02] the Lord but in the end he knew my
[55:06] choice before I made it yeah so that is
[55:09] that has been like one of the one of the
[55:12] like the best Revelations that that I
[55:15] have like when I was in my lowest
[55:18] point um and I think I thought I
[55:22] couldn't I I can't even go any further I
[55:24] I I like I told you before I I I feel
[55:28] and still like feel if I look back like
[55:31] I it's just a miracle that I'm here yeah
[55:33] I I I like it has given me so much
[55:36] appreciation for the the for the Lord I
[55:41] like my love for him has grown so much
[55:44] through all of this just seeing that he
[55:46] has loved me unconditionally instead in
[55:49] spite of my failures in spite of all my
[55:51] mistakes and and been willing to for
[55:55] forgive me that that I'm coming like
[55:58] even if I have come up to the point that
[56:00] I feel like I'm not worth it I'm not
[56:02] worth it and I'm that um but he his love
[56:06] is so great and and experiencing that
[56:09] love and experiencing that you are able
[56:12] to maybe give that forward
[56:14] and and like there's so much layers of
[56:19] it like yeah like coming to the to the
[56:22] humility like just being humble in front
[56:25] of the Lord and and just being willing
[56:27] to to surrender your life uh it's hard
[56:32] it's hard to like maybe give advice
[56:35] let's say everything would have worked
[56:37] out well for me let's say that I have
[56:39] built this house and it it just been a a
[56:41] huge success I I I've made a lot of
[56:44] profit and gone into the next houses and
[56:46] next houses where would I be today yeah
[56:49] so it's it's because of his CH Chast
[56:52] chastising and and his love that he
[56:55] he is working this work um through all
[56:59] of the things that we go through so
[57:01] basically an an advice would be
[57:04] to
[57:05] like if if you have if you're going
[57:08] through a trial if you're going through
[57:10] a hard time
[57:12] um I think it it it's like so easy to
[57:16] say you I would recommend you go and
[57:18] pray and I would recommend you do a fast
[57:21] and and read the Bible but I didn't
[57:23] always do that I went often the hard way
[57:26] just just rebelling and and just feeling
[57:29] bitter and anger and but that has that
[57:34] is that is the hard route yeah and and
[57:37] and I would recommend if possible that
[57:41] people would try to find a easier right
[57:43] just go with the Lord right away yeah I
[57:46] mean that's that's some good advice it
[57:48] really is um so that is
[57:52] um yeah I think that like this is a good
[57:55] testimony I have like there are many
[57:57] things that has been happening the last
[57:59] few months um I'm doing I'm doing I I I
[58:05] quit the job that I had I'm just going
[58:07] trying I'm going as much into ministry
[58:09] as I can I'm I'm translating all of the
[58:13] secret of the Kingdom uh series with
[58:16] Neville Johnson and putting on my
[58:17] website probably going to migrate that
[58:20] into a Bible School to start teaching
[58:22] teaching people the foundations of the
[58:24] faith
[58:25] um I'm also I'm also part of a Ministry
[58:28] in in reic which is like people coming
[58:32] out from the streets from drugs from
[58:34] rehabs and just taking their first steps
[58:37] in the faith I'm preaching there once in
[58:38] a while and praying and part of the
[58:40] prayer prayer prayer team to pray for
[58:42] those guys and helping them that's a
[58:45] blessing yeah that's AES blessing to
[58:47] help help in that so a lot of things is
[58:50] happening a lot of good things are
[58:52] happening but the main theme for for me
[58:55] now if if I would just end on this yeah
[58:58] um the main theme of this after all of
[59:01] that I think I believe I'm I'm closer uh
[59:08] to I'm closer to the Lord than ever
[59:10] before and everything is like inside of
[59:14] me is
[59:17] like to like pulling towards Christ in
[59:21] me being fully formed and and I am him
[59:25] this is what we're like of course we're
[59:26] preaching we're in a camp meeting it's
[59:28] like the theme we just we go it has been
[59:31] it has become so
[59:33] real this this uh like the stature of a
[59:37] perfect man he just taking over yeah and
[59:40] when I'm praying like the Lord's Prayer
[59:42] now I I'm I'm going into detail like the
[59:44] P like Pastor has been tell like like
[59:47] having this like the Lord's Prayer just
[59:49] as a foundation for our prayers and I'm
[59:52] going in like into more deep depths when
[59:55] I'm praying it but there is one part of
[59:57] that prayer which is standing out like
[1:00:00] and has is like the most powerful
[1:00:03] section for me now when I'm praying is I
[1:00:07] when I when I come to give me my daily
[1:00:10] give me today my daily bread and and
[1:00:13] just like uh like emphasizing around
[1:00:17] that is like what is that daily bread
[1:00:19] that Daily Bread is the word of the lord
[1:00:22] it's like getting the spiritual bread
[1:00:25] that that it's his will and only his
[1:00:28] will so that is that is powerful for me
[1:00:32] yeah for sure well thank you so much for
[1:00:34] doing this with me coming on uh would
[1:00:36] you mind praying over everybody and just
[1:00:39] over this everything before we sign off
[1:00:42] yeah no
[1:00:43] problem Jesus we thank you for this
[1:00:45] moment and time that we were able to be
[1:00:47] here together and I pray that my
[1:00:50] testimony all the things that I have
[1:00:52] gone through F father and and I believe
[1:00:55] that they for those that love you this
[1:00:58] all has a meaning this all has some good
[1:01:02] meaning and and can help other people
[1:01:04] and I pray for the people that are
[1:01:06] watching that are going through
[1:01:08] trials that are having a hard time that
[1:01:11] feel maybe abandoned or or they don't
[1:01:14] know what their calling is or and they
[1:01:16] or or maybe even they have made huge
[1:01:19] mistakes they have done something that
[1:01:21] they are almost unable to forgive
[1:01:23] themselves for I have done I've done
[1:01:25] things like that that I had a tremendous
[1:01:28] hard time forgiving myself for but you
[1:01:31] are so forgiving you are like while we
[1:01:34] are here while we wake up in the morning
[1:01:36] and we take the first breath there is
[1:01:38] still chance there is always chance
[1:01:40] while we're here to do the right thing
[1:01:42] and you are forgiving and you want to
[1:01:45] make us like you so I pray for those
[1:01:49] that are in a place like that that you
[1:01:52] might give Comfort healing blessing and
[1:01:56] strength to endure and see that it is
[1:01:59] that you
[1:02:00] are working a work and you are not you
[1:02:03] you you we could say that you know our
[1:02:05] choices before we make them this is the
[1:02:08] biggest Revelation like I I've often
[1:02:11] said to you father like when I was in my
[1:02:15] lowest
[1:02:16] place father you must see a day in the
[1:02:19] future that I will become a Overcomer
[1:02:23] over this you had your you you saved me
[1:02:27] so you must see a place in the future so
