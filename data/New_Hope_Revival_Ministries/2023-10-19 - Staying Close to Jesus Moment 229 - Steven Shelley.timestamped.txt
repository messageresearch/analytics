[0:00] it's not just for women to be lovers
[0:02] it's not just for women to lay at the
[0:05] feet of Jesus it's not just for women to
[0:08] want to know his heartbeat it's not just
[0:11] for women to put their head on his chest
[0:14] so they can hear his
[0:15] heartbeat John was our
[0:18] example you sit wherever you want to sit
[0:22] you sit at the back door if you want to
[0:25] you sit on the back row if you want to
[0:28] but John said
[0:32] you don't have to like me you don't have
[0:34] to like it you don't have to like my
[0:36] position I'm not sitting there for
[0:39] you I want to be as close to him as I
[0:43] can John said uh I I know I know they're
[0:46] going to call me I know what they're
[0:47] going to say I know they're going to say
[0:50] I want the attention I know they're
[0:51] going to say I think I'm better than
[0:53] they are but I cannot afford for his
[0:55] heart to beat and me not know what he's
[0:57] beating
[0:58] to
[1:01] woo there is no sensation in this world
[1:06] there is no sensation in this world
[1:08] there is nothing in this life there is
[1:11] no feeling in this life that can
[1:14] compare to when God Almighty by the Holy
[1:16] Ghost comes and makes love over the
[1:19] promise of his word in you come on now
[1:22] you're not going to have power to change
[1:24] your life to set yourself free to
[1:27] deliver yourself to be more like him by
[1:30] looking at how how what reality says
[1:33] about your image but if you look at his
[1:36] image if you'll see the stature of the
[1:39] perfect man in the mirror if you'll see
[1:40] the perfect reflection of the perfect
[1:42] word looking back at you if when you
[1:44] look in the mirror you see Jesus instead
[1:46] of yourself you've got something to to
[1:48] to pull up to you've got something to to
[1:51] to reach a hold
[1:54] of he's the man in the mirror if you're
[1:57] still the man in your mirror you're
[1:58] going to miss this thing
[2:04] how do you become the apple of his
[2:06] eye he's got to be looking at
[2:09] you and he said if they touch
[2:12] you they have touched the apple of my
[2:14] eye let me tell you what God's saying
[2:17] they he's saying they take you
[2:19] apart they're touching the apple of his
[2:21] eye they didn't put you in God's
[2:24] eye he chose what to look at he chose
[2:28] you he'll look at you if he wants to
[2:31] don't matter what anybody else says if
[2:33] he's looking at you and you're the
[2:34] little man in his eye if you're the
[2:37] little reflection in his eye don't
[2:38] matter what anybody else thinks about
[2:40] you when they touch you they're touching
[2:42] him when they're condemning you they're
[2:45] condemning him when they're judging you
[2:46] they're judging
[2:49] [Music]
[2:53] him
