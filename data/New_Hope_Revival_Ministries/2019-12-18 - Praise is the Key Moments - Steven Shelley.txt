Description:
Praise is part of the key to moving in peace. When we praise we are inviting the Lord to come & have a part in our life, to be in the middle of our stuff.

We don't praise because we are worthy, we praise because He is worthy & in return, He comes and abides in our praise & gives us the grace for whatever we are walking through.
