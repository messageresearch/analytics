[40:31] we have that you are
[40:34] in our lives through the baptism of the
[40:36] holy ghost
[40:38] lord when we think about this little
[40:40] course and we think back in the time of
[40:43] scripture when jesus was on earth and he
[40:46] was walking and somebody would reach out
[40:49] and touch him oh they had to wait till
[40:51] he went by them to touch them but you
[40:54] lord have been so gracious to us in this
[40:58] end time to give us of your holy spirit
[41:01] on the inside and at any time we can
[41:04] raise up in faith and know
[41:06] that you dwell in us and you are here to
[41:08] move on our behalf we just want to
[41:11] praise you for that lord thank you that
[41:14] you are here today
[41:15] we brought you with us and we thank you
[41:18] that corporate worship
[41:20] can magnify and increase the glory of
[41:23] the lord around us and we thank you for
[41:26] that lord
[41:27] now god as we bring you these needs they
[41:30] are many they are heavy god we think
[41:33] about those that have lost loved ones
[41:35] and we're asking god today that you
[41:38] would give comfort and minister to their
[41:40] grieving hearts as only you can lord i
[41:45] thank you that we do not have to grieve
[41:47] as others but you gave us a hope and a
[41:50] promise that we will be reunited
[41:54] and we give you praise for that now lord
[41:57] there are those who are in pain today we
[42:00] remember bethany dalton
[42:02] to you lord and ask that you would give
[42:05] supernatural recovery into her body
[42:08] touch her life lord like she has never
[42:11] experienced you before we pray this in
[42:15] the name of jesus christ
[42:17] the hands that were raised across this
[42:19] building lord those that were raised on
[42:22] the stream god i am lifting every one of
[42:25] them up to you believing that you are
[42:28] ministering to every need god you see
[42:32] every little detail today
[42:34] how that it is affecting hearts and
[42:36] minds and and even atmospheres of homes
[42:41] god i pray that you will just step right
[42:44] into the midst of these situations and
[42:46] you will bring relief you will bring
[42:49] strength you will bring the remedy that
[42:51] is needed that you will bring salvation
[42:53] lord as you have already
[42:56] purchased through the blood of jesus
[42:58] christ i pray god that you will set
[43:01] homes in order in the name of the lord
[43:04] jesus christ
[43:06] we bless you and we give you praise lord
[43:09] because you do not change you remain the
[43:11] same and we're gathered here today
[43:14] because we want to hear what you would
[43:17] say unto the body today and i'm asking
[43:20] god that you would help every one of us
[43:22] to have our hearts and our ears tuned to
[43:25] the spirit of the lord
[43:27] as our brother would step behind this
[43:29] desk to deliver the word of the lord i
[43:31] pray that there be heavy anointing upon
[43:34] him that he would be able to deliver
[43:36] without any uh any fear any uh
[43:41] hardship lord he'd be able to deliver
[43:43] with ease the word of the lord
[43:46] we receive whatever you have for us
[43:49] today
[43:50] may we be strengthened in the goodness
[43:52] of the lord we give you praise and honor
[43:55] and glory for it's in the name of the
[43:57] lord jesus christ that we pray
[44:01] amen and amen
[44:08] hallelujah
[44:13] praise the lord
[44:16] you may have your seat today
[44:20] we're glad to be gathered together
[44:23] you know so often after a song we clap
[44:26] our hands and while we're singing we
[44:28] clap our hands
[44:30] scripture says clap your hands
[44:33] shout unto god with the voice of triumph
[44:36] just a few days ago i just happened to
[44:39] see a little uh writing of some sort
[44:41] don't even remember where i saw it but
[44:43] it talked about when you clap there's a
[44:45] vibration that goes in your hands and i
[44:48] got to thinking you know i didn't search
[44:50] it out but i got to thinking about how
[44:52] that the hand and the feet they they
[44:54] there's there's uh points on your hand
[44:57] that correspond with all parts of your
[45:00] body
[45:01] and as you clap and you that put that
[45:03] vibration there
[45:05] there's somehow that i think that it it
[45:08] it goes through our physical body
[45:11] and and somehow it amplifies even our
[45:14] voice or our praise unto the lord
[45:17] and and
[45:19] there's a whole lot more to it but i
[45:21] just believe that clapping our hands
[45:23] unto the lord is is good practice
[45:28] and when we're singing a song
[45:33] [Applause]
[45:37] hallelujah
[45:39] glory glory glory glory
[45:45] blessed be the name of the lord
[45:47] [Music]
[45:50] [Applause]
[45:53] we have heard preaching about sound and
[45:55] we've heard talk about how perhaps
[45:58] that's how that the stones in enoch's
[46:00] pyramid were put there
[46:02] nothing may be strong enough to lift it
[46:04] into position i don't know
[46:06] but you have also heard around here that
[46:09] sometimes we'll change the key to the
[46:11] song to get maybe to what the spirit's
[46:14] trying to get us to
[46:15] and so maybe when we're clapping and
[46:18] singing our the vibration of the
[46:21] clapping can raise that song to another
[46:24] level and move demon spirits out of the
[46:27] way
[46:28] so don't ever miss an opportunity to
[46:31] give god glory with your voice and to
[46:34] give him glory with the clapping of your
[46:36] hands or the lifting of your hands it's
[46:39] just demonstration yes lord
[46:42] i'm coming into agreement with what i'm
[46:45] singing about or what i'm preaching
[46:48] about i'm coming into agreement
[46:58] [Applause]
[47:06] [Music]
[47:18] hallelujah
[47:21] [Music]
[47:23] [Applause]
[47:30] hallelujah hallelujah
[47:34] bless the name of the lord
[47:38] hallelujah hallelujah
[47:41] lord i give you glory
[47:48] hallelujah
[47:50] these things are not as repetitive and
[47:53] mundane as sometimes our minds want us
[47:56] to think they are
[47:58] they're not
[48:01] god gave us these ways to praise him
[48:05] and he knew every little detail of what
[48:08] he said that it was not just a word on a
[48:12] page just to get people to move
[48:15] god has a plan
[48:17] and he has a way that he can get things
[48:20] done
[48:21] even when we don't know what is
[48:23] happening
[48:25] hallelujah
[48:28] praise the lord
[48:30] glory glory glory
[48:33] thank you jesus
[48:35] well we're glad to be gathered
[48:38] we come together
[48:41] maybe when we're in our secret closet
[48:44] we're
[48:45] praying and seeing things move but when
[48:47] we come together with god's people and
[48:49] we can
[48:52] get a hold of what god is doing
[48:55] we can move things together
[48:58] amen
[49:00] and that is exactly what is happening
[49:03] with this loan on this property
[49:07] you have
[49:09] been so faithful to give this talk
[49:14] all right
[49:18] so 5100
[49:21] was given
[49:22] this month so far toward the principal
[49:26] loan that would make it 132
[49:31] 762 approximately that was has been
[49:35] given toward this
[49:38] loan on this property and we give god
[49:41] praise for that
[49:45] hallelujah
[49:47] [Applause]
[49:49] hallelujah
[49:54] praise the lord
[49:56] now you get in the mundane
[49:59] of paying the payment every month
[50:02] it's got to be done
[50:04] it's part of it
[50:06] when you
[50:08] borrow money it has to be paid back
[50:12] and
[50:14] i don't say these numbers very often
[50:18] because it
[50:20] causes us to lose steam it causes us
[50:22] maybe to lose heart
[50:25] but
[50:26] we started out at four hundred and
[50:28] eighty thousand dollars
[50:30] the current balance on the loan is three
[50:32] hundred and fifty four thousand one
[50:34] hundred and twenty eight dollars
[50:36] now when you do the math
[50:38] it looks to me
[50:41] like what you have given on the
[50:43] principle
[50:44] is the only thing that has taken the
[50:46] loan down
[50:48] because if i do the math right
[50:51] i mean with the interest that is
[50:53] compounded every month
[50:56] it doesn't look like the payment has
[50:57] done anything
[50:59] you're right
[51:00] and so
[51:03] i just am grateful
[51:05] that the lord is doing this it is him
[51:08] and i bless his name for it
[51:10] he is good now we've got camp meeting
[51:13] coming in in about uh two weeks
[51:17] no
[51:18] week and a half
[51:20] camp meeting will be starting there's
[51:22] some cleaning that needs to be done
[51:23] around here and some yard work that that
[51:26] needs to be done
[51:28] and
[51:30] i am
[51:31] counting on you
[51:33] i'm not going to appoint anybody but i
[51:36] won't be here
[51:38] so somebody's got to take initiative to
[51:40] help to get the building cleaned ready
[51:42] for camp meeting and any yard work
[51:44] that's done somebody's going to have to
[51:46] take the initiative i know that the
[51:48] grass has been cut in some of the bushes
[51:50] and we you know that's got to be
[51:52] brought up to date and i'm sure that it
[51:54] will be but we want to make the grounds
[51:56] look as good as possible and so i'm
[51:59] counting on you and asking that you
[52:01] would be willing to help us to get to
[52:04] the building and the grounds to look as
[52:06] good as possible for camp meeting we are
[52:08] looking for the lord to do something
[52:10] marvelous among us but i'm not waiting
[52:13] till then for the lord to do something
[52:15] marvelous among us i'm here today
[52:18] believing that the lord is going to do
[52:20] something marvelous for me
[52:23] something that will build my faith that
[52:25] will strengthen me that will give me
[52:28] vision for tomorrow and through the week
[52:31] he'll just help me to understand what he
[52:35] wants me to do the the sons of god are
[52:38] led by the spirit of god
[52:41] and
[52:42] not always is it him just whispering the
[52:46] next move but he gave his word to help
[52:49] to direct us and i'm here today to hear
[52:52] the word of the lord before we hear the
[52:55] word of the lord we want to receive the
[52:57] tithe and the offering stephen will you

[55:15] take what has been given that you would
[55:17] multiply it as you have done many times

[57:29] aren't you glad for the blessed hope
[57:31] praise god
[57:37] you may be seated
[57:38] i'm reminded of the old hymn what a
[57:40] gathering of the faithful that will be
[57:43] and there is going to be a gathering
[57:46] just over the sun just over the hill
[57:49] god has something wonderful prepared for
[57:51] those who trust him do you believe that
[57:54] amen god bless you today what a
[57:57] wonderful blessing to be in the house of
[57:59] the lord
[58:00] we thank you for all of your prayers for
[58:02] those who have needed prayers this week
[58:05] and we're just delighted that god is
[58:07] moving he's moving and he's ministering
[58:10] to those needs we want to thank him for
[58:12] it and
[58:13] uh while brother greeley was talking
[58:15] about the offering there there are some
[58:17] of you who are particularly interested
[58:19] in what
[58:20] happens with the payment for jerusalem
[58:22] and we want you to know that we were
[58:24] able to make i think the last two
[58:27] quarters able to make it without asking
[58:29] for any extra help the lord has done
[58:31] that you've designated your money so
[58:33] that's being taken care of i want to
[58:35] thank the lord for that
[58:37] this week paid this week
[58:42] everything you give toward the principle
[58:45] goes toward the principle you have do
[58:48] not have to worry about that it is taken
[58:50] care of we did tell you that this last
[58:53] month we did not make an extra payment
[58:56] which we had been trying to do that was
[58:58] one of the things brother greeley asked
[58:59] us to do and we've been trying to do
[59:02] that but we weren't able to do it this
[59:04] past month but that's okay
[59:07] it's going to be all right because
[59:09] jerusalem is met and the other needs are
[59:11] being met we just praise god for what
[59:13] he's doing and the past is behind us and
[59:16] the future is ahead of us amen but i
[59:19] want you to know we take it very serious
[59:21] and what you give goes to where it's
[59:23] supposed to go to and if you have any
[59:26] questions you can come to us you
[59:28] certainly can you have every right to do
[59:30] that and we'll make sure that you see
[59:32] look and we might not show you what
[59:35] other people give
[59:37] uh we can show you totals we might not
[59:39] let you look at somebody else's records
[59:41] but you can see yours
[59:42] and you can see what goes in and comes
[59:44] out
[59:45] and sometimes i think it overwhelms
[59:47] people when they think about what it
[59:49] costs
[59:50] power bills and insurance and all the
[59:52] different things that we have to take
[59:53] care of but you know god is so good and
[59:56] he is good through you
[59:58] and we thank you so much for everything
[1:00:00] you do amen
[1:00:02] there's a few birthdays this week and uh

[1:02:37] confusion i can and uh sometimes i've
[1:02:40] had to go back and check this one so we
[1:02:42] wanted you to have that and we can put
[1:02:44] that on the on the on it probably will

[1:03:04] have mine that way and it's a wonderful
[1:03:07] thing to be able to press a button on
[1:03:08] your phone and it go to your wireless
[1:03:10] printer and have it in your hand the
[1:03:12] lord is good to us with technology isn't
[1:03:14] he amen i'm glad to be here this morning
[1:03:19] i am i'm glad that the lord came he has
[1:03:21] been here brother greeley i tell you
[1:03:23] that was about to lift me off the
[1:03:25] platform
[1:03:26] what he was reminding us of sharing with
[1:03:28] us about the clapping of the hands
[1:03:31] i was so blessed
[1:03:33] we're going to wait and see at the end
[1:03:34] of this service what time to announce
[1:03:37] the baptism but it'll either be 5 or 5
[1:03:39] 30. all are welcome to come
[1:03:42] to our backyard
[1:03:44] and uh we're going to be baptizing
[1:03:47] brother steve polk today we're going to
[1:03:49] be baptizing uh jesse
[1:03:52] washington
[1:03:53] who one time told me he didn't see
[1:03:56] what was all that important about
[1:03:58] baptism or something along those lines
[1:04:00] we didn't harass him
[1:04:02] didn't didn't bother him one bit
[1:04:05] we just waited
[1:04:06] and the lord touched him up in lagrange
[1:04:09] i mean the lord touched him in lagrange
[1:04:14] and they had to hold him up because the
[1:04:16] spirit of the lord was all over him
[1:04:18] after that he said i'd like to be
[1:04:20] baptized
[1:04:22] see that was the lord doing the work he
[1:04:24] touched his heart and
[1:04:26] i think that's the right way
[1:04:28] and then ariel we might as well go ahead
[1:04:30] and start with her now
[1:04:32] so that when it comes she won't be
[1:04:34] embarrassed but she has reached that age
[1:04:37] where she wants to be baptized in the
[1:04:39] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:04:42] and
[1:04:43] that's the baby of the family
[1:04:45] unless there's another one comes along
[1:04:48] then
[1:04:49] then that's their last one to see
[1:04:51] baptized in his name boy that went over
[1:04:54] well
[1:04:57] what a joy to baptize her
[1:04:59] i had a dream last night
[1:05:02] and in this dream ginger was talking to
[1:05:05] olivia
[1:05:07] and i'm just going to be totally
[1:05:08] transparent
[1:05:10] i thought to myself and this is no
[1:05:12] criticism of you ginger i promise i want
[1:05:14] you to know the whole dream
[1:05:16] not not the whole dream but
[1:05:18] more of it than than
[1:05:20] the part i mentioned
[1:05:22] i thought in my dream i thought what is
[1:05:24] ginger talking to olivia about
[1:05:26] she's talking to her like she's a little
[1:05:28] baby
[1:05:29] her voice was like you would talk to
[1:05:31] ezekiel or one of these little ones and
[1:05:33] i couldn't hear what she was saying
[1:05:35] and i got close enough to hear what she
[1:05:38] was doing with a lot of patients but i
[1:05:40] thought doesn't she see how big how big
[1:05:42] olivia is and how olivia's growing up
[1:05:45] why is she talking to her like a little
[1:05:46] baby so i walked over there close and
[1:05:48] olivia said i want to be baptized
[1:05:52] that was in the dream
[1:05:54] and i think a few more things were said
[1:05:57] and
[1:05:58] and jennifer said well we'll see we'll
[1:06:00] see about that we'll see about that and
[1:06:02] that was the end of it and i thought i'm
[1:06:04] not going to say anything i'm just going
[1:06:05] to wait till we get over there today and
[1:06:08] see what happens
[1:06:09] and i had a thought in my mind that when
[1:06:11] we say anybody else
[1:06:13] that maybe she would turn to ginger
[1:06:15] and maybe ginger would say well you may
[1:06:17] not be ready yet and i might see it and
[1:06:20] i might be able to say hey there's my
[1:06:21] dream let's let's bring her on in
[1:06:24] you're not hurt with me are you ginger
[1:06:26] no please don't be
[1:06:28] and and on the way to church this
[1:06:30] morning i got a text and she said i'm
[1:06:31] not sure i'm not sure if she's but she
[1:06:34] said olivia's asking to be baptized
[1:06:38] i said let's do it i dreamed last night
[1:06:41] that she asked about it let's do it
[1:06:44] praise god praise the lord
[1:06:47] i like that
[1:06:51] for me and i hope for ginger that'll be
[1:06:53] confirmation she's ready to be baptized
[1:06:56] that's what brother branham told us if
[1:06:58] they're old enough to ask
[1:07:00] then they're old enough to be
[1:07:02] so i'm i'm really thankful so it'll
[1:07:04] either be at 5 or 5 30. we'll just see
[1:07:06] what the service and at the end we'll
[1:07:08] announce it and we'll go from there but
[1:07:10] we're looking forward to baptizing that
[1:07:11] i get everybody i think that was
[1:07:13] everybody that's asked but if you're
[1:07:15] here and you need to need a baptism the
[1:07:17] real baptism the right baptism we'll be

[1:11:06] amen thank you musicians we appreciate
[1:11:08] your help today god bless you everyone
[1:11:12] genesis chapter 1
[1:11:15] beginning in verse 11
[1:11:17] those of you who have
[1:11:19] a heart to do so would you pull with me
[1:11:22] this morning
[1:11:24] hello
[1:11:27] i'm waiting for a response that was a
[1:11:29] question
[1:11:30] uh would you pull with me
[1:11:33] because i want to get something out and
[1:11:35] i want you to receive something from it
[1:11:38] and uh i believe it would be a wonderful
[1:11:40] thing for you to participate
[1:11:42] and i think that if you'll do that
[1:11:44] you'll get a whole lot more out of me
[1:11:46] and i believe you'll get a whole lot
[1:11:48] more out of this
[1:11:49] uh subject this morning it's a little a
[1:11:51] little difficult to navigate because
[1:11:55] uh
[1:11:56] well you'll see in just a moment let's
[1:11:58] just get into it it's the word of god
[1:12:00] and it and you'll see that it's a truth
[1:12:02] no doubt but i want you to
[1:12:04] make it personal if possible and i see
[1:12:07] here a brother joining us from romania
[1:12:10] god bless you i believe that's a brother
[1:12:12] god bless you in romania genesis 1 verse
[1:12:16] 11 and god said let the earth bring
[1:12:20] forth grass the herb yielding seed and
[1:12:24] the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
[1:12:28] kind whose seed is in itself upon the
[1:12:32] earth and it was so
[1:12:36] so just notice that if you'll just go
[1:12:39] right back just notice that he spoke and
[1:12:42] the fruit tree
[1:12:44] yielding its fruit after his kind notice
[1:12:48] this phrase brother branham enjoyed this
[1:12:50] whose seed is in itself so these trees
[1:12:56] that were created there in the garden
[1:12:58] they had in them the seed of other
[1:13:00] generations right
[1:13:02] in fact he said every apple tree that
[1:13:04] was ever going to be in the earth was
[1:13:06] represented in those original apple
[1:13:09] trees that's powerful to me it helps me
[1:13:12] understand the cycle of life he said
[1:13:15] whose seed is in itself upon the earth
[1:13:18] and it was so
[1:13:21] and the earth brought forth grass and
[1:13:23] herb yielding seed after his kind and
[1:13:27] the tree yielding fruit whose seed was
[1:13:29] in itself after his kind and god saw
[1:13:32] that it was good and the evening and the
[1:13:36] morning were the third day
[1:13:39] and god said
[1:13:41] let there be lights in the firmament of
[1:13:43] the heaven to divide the day from the
[1:13:47] night and let them be for
[1:13:50] signs let's say that out signs
[1:13:53] and for seasons and for days and years
[1:13:59] so he placed these lights in the
[1:14:01] firmament of the heaven to divide the
[1:14:04] day from the night
[1:14:06] and to provide for us signs
[1:14:09] seasons days and years how many of you
[1:14:12] can see that clearly in your bible
[1:14:15] now go to ecclesiastes
[1:14:19] chapter 3 and verse 1.
[1:14:21] these are verses that you're more than
[1:14:24] familiar with but i wanted to lay them
[1:14:26] again as a foundation for where we're
[1:14:29] going to go in the word
[1:14:31] i'm just going to read verse 1.
[1:14:34] although i like the first eight verses a
[1:14:36] whole lot we might come back to them but
[1:14:39] verse 1 says to everything
[1:14:42] there is a
[1:14:45] season
[1:14:47] and a
[1:14:48] time to every purpose
[1:14:52] under the heaven
[1:14:54] just for anyone who might not be
[1:14:56] familiar just give us one more verse
[1:14:59] just to show you how it went back and
[1:15:00] forth a time to be born
[1:15:03] and a time
[1:15:05] to die
[1:15:06] a time to plant
[1:15:09] and a time to pluck up that which is
[1:15:12] planted would you permit us to go on
[1:15:14] just another minute
[1:15:16] a time to kill
[1:15:18] and a time to heal
[1:15:20] a time to break down
[1:15:22] and a time to build up a time to weep
[1:15:25] and a time to laugh
[1:15:27] a time to mourn
[1:15:29] and a time to dance
[1:15:31] a time to cast away stones
[1:15:33] and a time to gather stones together
[1:15:36] a time to embrace and a time to refrain
[1:15:40] from embracing
[1:15:42] a time to get
[1:15:43] and a time to lose
[1:15:45] a time to keep
[1:15:47] and a time to
[1:15:53] i could hear my wifey amen
[1:15:56] in my mind a time to keep and a time to
[1:16:00] get rid of
[1:16:02] a time to rend
[1:16:06] and a time to sow
[1:16:09] remember
[1:16:11] he said to us a time to re-end and a
[1:16:13] time demand
[1:16:15] a time to keep silence
[1:16:18] and a time to speak
[1:16:21] a time to love and a time to hate
[1:16:24] a time of war
[1:16:26] and a time of peace
[1:16:28] to everything
[1:16:30] there is a season
[1:16:32] and a time to every purpose under the
[1:16:36] heaven
[1:16:37] let's pray together lord jesus
[1:16:40] we thank you this morning
[1:16:42] for what we've already experienced in
[1:16:45] you
[1:16:46] i i could feel that
[1:16:50] i i don't hardly know how to describe it
[1:16:53] brother greeley was talking about
[1:16:55] vibration
[1:16:57] i i could feel something like that
[1:17:00] reverberating in my inner being
[1:17:04] as he talked about it
[1:17:06] oh and i'm just thinking about if if
[1:17:09] there's truth to that and i know there
[1:17:11] is because i've studied it out myself
[1:17:14] that every time we praise the lord that
[1:17:17] way we're bringing healing to our own
[1:17:20] body
[1:17:21] and i like many of your saints today
[1:17:24] could use a healing touch
[1:17:27] and so lord it made me want to
[1:17:30] participate in every part of praise
[1:17:34] and also receive the benefit that comes
[1:17:38] i love
[1:17:39] sowing to the heavens
[1:17:42] knowing that when we do
[1:17:44] your blessing your provision your
[1:17:47] healing
[1:17:48] rains down upon us
[1:17:50] we are a grateful people today
[1:17:53] not nearly as grateful as we ought to be
[1:17:56] but we're trying to be more mindful of
[1:18:00] every gift
[1:18:02] every provision
[1:18:04] every blessing
[1:18:05] lord today i need you
[1:18:08] to help me get through this
[1:18:10] i need you lord to help me deliver and i
[1:18:13] need you to prepare a people to hear i'm
[1:18:16] depending on you lord with everything
[1:18:19] that i know too i'm leaning on you to
[1:18:21] help us
[1:18:22] in the wonderful name of the lord jesus
[1:18:25] christ we pray
[1:18:27] amen and the saint said
[1:18:30] you may be seated
[1:18:32] we are
[1:18:33] closing out
[1:18:35] 20 21.
[1:18:40] we have some time left
[1:18:43] but when we see that hebrew calendar
[1:18:46] change every year
[1:18:47] we know that the year is nearly done
[1:18:51] even on our gregorian calendar when we
[1:18:54] reach the feast of trumpets every year
[1:18:58] and we think about the fact that yom
[1:19:01] kippur is just right around the corner
[1:19:03] the day of atonement
[1:19:05] and the reason why it matters is because
[1:19:08] it reminds us of a god who is faithful
[1:19:11] to his word
[1:19:12] he kept every one of the spring feasts
[1:19:15] and fulfilled them with his life
[1:19:18] he kept every one of the fall feasts and
[1:19:21] he is fulfilling them
[1:19:23] with his life
[1:19:25] he laid a foundation in type and shadow
[1:19:29] and then he came
[1:19:30] and the word was made flesh
[1:19:33] and dwelt among us so the shadow
[1:19:36] first the type first
[1:19:38] then
[1:19:39] the reality we are no longer living in
[1:19:42] the shadow we're no longer living in the
[1:19:45] type we're now seeing god's reality and
[1:19:49] his fulfillment we don't have everything
[1:19:52] that we're believing for but we press on
[1:19:55] and when we feel discouraged we pull
[1:19:58] ourselves up by the bootstraps and do it
[1:20:02] by the power of the holy ghost
[1:20:04] so even that we don't do by ourself we
[1:20:07] encourage ourselves by the grace that
[1:20:10] god has given us
[1:20:11] praying in the spirit
[1:20:13] i i know that's not what you want to
[1:20:16] hear this morning but i'm telling you
[1:20:19] that there is
[1:20:20] not nearly enough said or perhaps even
[1:20:23] known about the benefit of praying in
[1:20:27] the holy ghost
[1:20:29] and those of you who are so very careful
[1:20:32] that you wouldn't dare want to uh
[1:20:35] use any tongues in a public service we
[1:20:38] just honor you for that we find that all
[1:20:41] right you you just do it just like like
[1:20:44] you should but oh i pray that you won't
[1:20:47] quench the flow
[1:20:49] uh so that when you really need to get
[1:20:51] ahold of god and your mind won't catch
[1:20:54] up with your heart
[1:20:56] there's just times that the need is so
[1:20:58] big you don't even know how to begin
[1:21:01] sometimes uh i begin an urgent prayer
[1:21:04] like that
[1:21:05] like this oh god you know
[1:21:09] oh god you know i don't know
[1:21:13] but oh god you know and what a peace
[1:21:17] what a peace
[1:21:18] start settling down
[1:21:20] knowing that you may not know it all
[1:21:22] sometimes it's hard to get all the
[1:21:24] information
[1:21:26] you know here was a girl who had this
[1:21:28] accident and they wouldn't allow anyone
[1:21:30] in with her
[1:21:32] even the friends that were with her her
[1:21:34] parents are in hawaii and they wouldn't
[1:21:36] let anyone in the room and they wouldn't
[1:21:39] give any information to those that were
[1:21:41] there and even when the family called
[1:21:43] and said please
[1:21:45] please let let this girl go in and be
[1:21:48] with our daughter so that she's not
[1:21:50] alone and doesn't feel like she's alone
[1:21:52] and they said that would be against all
[1:21:54] hospital policies and we can't do that
[1:21:57] and so you're getting you know bits and
[1:21:59] pieces and you're trying to be faithful
[1:22:01] to pray and you just don't know all the
[1:22:03] details you don't know if you're praying
[1:22:05] for somebody who's drawing their last
[1:22:07] breath or if they're stable i finally
[1:22:10] said let's just ask if she's critical or
[1:22:13] stable but here is the peace that we
[1:22:15] have god knows
[1:22:18] he knows
[1:22:19] so what if i pray it the wrong way
[1:22:23] so what if my words come out and i i'm
[1:22:25] praying like it's critical and she's
[1:22:27] stable
[1:22:29] who cares god knows
[1:22:32] and if i say it wrong he's still on the
[1:22:34] case
[1:22:36] but we have a desire to know
[1:22:38] and when we know not how to pray as we
[1:22:41] should
[1:22:43] i'm so thankful that we have an advocate
[1:22:47] we have someone who will pray through us
[1:22:50] pray through us in the holy ghost
[1:22:53] and i need it i need it i need it i have
[1:22:56] to have that
[1:22:58] it's a great release for me
[1:23:00] and my granny taught me so many years
[1:23:02] ago she said don't ever let the day be
[1:23:05] over without you have prayed in tongues
[1:23:08] that day and i said well granny you
[1:23:10] can't just do it whenever you get ready
[1:23:12] to she said well i'll tell you how to
[1:23:13] fix that you just pray in english until
[1:23:16] you can't pray in english anymore
[1:23:19] you just pray for everything you know
[1:23:22] and once you've used all the words you
[1:23:24] can get
[1:23:26] i guarantee you if you'll let him the
[1:23:28] holy ghost will come and pray through
[1:23:30] you anybody want to say thank god for
[1:23:32] that
[1:23:34] there's no intercession like holy ghost
[1:23:36] intercession
[1:23:38] now i'm going to say a few things that i
[1:23:41] shared with you a couple years back
[1:23:43] uh just a little several thoughts here
[1:23:45] before we move into what what i want to
[1:23:47] speak on today
[1:23:49] the reason why times
[1:23:52] and seasons and signs
[1:23:55] and days and years are so important is
[1:23:59] because god established them he went to
[1:24:02] such a great depth of
[1:24:04] of effort to put these light these great
[1:24:08] lights in the heavens in the firmament
[1:24:11] to divide the night from the day because
[1:24:13] this is how he was going to measure out
[1:24:16] the signs and the seasons and the days
[1:24:20] and the years we hear so much through
[1:24:23] the course of a year
[1:24:25] uh in social media and even in regular
[1:24:28] media
[1:24:29] about the different kinds of moons you
[1:24:32] know the harvest moon the wolf moon the
[1:24:34] blue moon the i don't know cow moon i
[1:24:36] don't know what kind of moon they're
[1:24:38] always talking about it and i don't have
[1:24:41] time maybe you do i doubt it but i don't
[1:24:43] have time to research every moon
[1:24:47] i i couldn't trace all that down
[1:24:49] sometimes i hear people post and say
[1:24:51] this is the only time this will happen
[1:24:53] in the next uh 400 years it'll never be
[1:24:56] just and i i can't always track that
[1:24:59] down but when i read it or when i hear
[1:25:01] about it i always say lord you're
[1:25:03] probably saying something don't let me
[1:25:07] miss it
[1:25:08] i realize my answer is not to be found
[1:25:11] in the newspaper
[1:25:12] and my answer is not to be found by
[1:25:14] google i know that if i should set my
[1:25:17] heart toward the lord and ask him oh god
[1:25:20] give me an ear to hear don't let me miss
[1:25:23] your voice i know that he's faithful
[1:25:26] that way if you believe that say amen so
[1:25:29] understanding it all is not always
[1:25:31] important but being ready to hear
[1:25:36] remember he said take heed
[1:25:39] how you hear
[1:25:41] he said in time what you hear
[1:25:43] and how you hear
[1:25:46] we need these seasons if we don't know
[1:25:48] where we are we'll never be able to
[1:25:50] determine where we're going
[1:25:52] seasons let us know when to do what
[1:25:56] and what to do when
[1:25:58] without seasons we become frustrated
[1:26:00] because we do things
[1:26:02] at the wrong time
[1:26:04] doing things at the right time is
[1:26:07] crucial if you believe that say man
[1:26:10] just in the natural
[1:26:12] doing things in the right season
[1:26:15] is very crucial therefore seasons are
[1:26:18] important now god could have caused the
[1:26:21] sun to shine all the time 24 hours of
[1:26:24] the day
[1:26:25] and he could have so designed that there
[1:26:27] be no changing of the seasons not in the
[1:26:30] natural and not in the spiritual but if
[1:26:33] he did that we would never know many
[1:26:35] things
[1:26:36] including when to go to sleep
[1:26:40] have you ever tried to sleep
[1:26:43] when it's bright daylight outside
[1:26:47] i've been to iceland as some of you have
[1:26:50] and i want you to know it's a very
[1:26:51] difficult time
[1:26:53] to try to go to bed at night when it's
[1:26:55] brightest day
[1:26:57] and if you're staying in a place that
[1:26:58] doesn't have blackout curtains
[1:27:00] you you might feel even
[1:27:02] energized i've laid down there at night
[1:27:05] when it was still bright day i've also
[1:27:08] been there when at 11 o'clock in the
[1:27:09] morning it was still dark
[1:27:11] now that's hard to get up
[1:27:14] and face a world like that
[1:27:16] but at least it does eventually come the
[1:27:18] sun does eventually go up and it does
[1:27:21] eventually go down if we didn't know
[1:27:24] when night was drawing near we wouldn't
[1:27:26] know when to rest if we didn't have
[1:27:28] seasons we wouldn't know when to plant
[1:27:31] we wouldn't know when to harvest what we
[1:27:32] have planted so god created seasons are
[1:27:36] you with me
[1:27:37] and so we we must cry out as christians
[1:27:40] i do and i hope you do
[1:27:42] as often as it would come to your mind
[1:27:44] and it's my responsibility to bring it
[1:27:47] to your mind from time to time we must
[1:27:50] cry out like the children of issachar
[1:27:52] that god would give us grace to be able
[1:27:55] to understand the season that we're in
[1:27:57] right now because you may not realize
[1:28:01] how swiftly one can come in and go out
[1:28:04] and another one come right in and you
[1:28:06] say hey what season am i standing in
[1:28:09] and we're talking about spiritually
[1:28:12] because we know that the natural is
[1:28:14] always typing the spiritual in first
[1:28:17] chronicles chapter 12 and verse 32 it
[1:28:21] says and of the children of issachar
[1:28:24] which were men that had understanding of
[1:28:27] the times lord i just want to ask you
[1:28:29] right now that you would allow your
[1:28:32] little bride in this place
[1:28:34] to be men and women who have discernment
[1:28:38] and understanding of the times
[1:28:41] we want to know
[1:28:42] what we ought to do
[1:28:45] we want to know what we ought to do he
[1:28:47] goes on to say they had understanding of
[1:28:50] the times to know what israel ought to
[1:28:52] do the heads of them were 200 and all
[1:28:55] their brethren were at their commandment
[1:28:57] i want you to know there were only 200
[1:29:00] captains
[1:29:02] that's not a huge tribe
[1:29:04] that's not a huge leadership for a huge
[1:29:07] tribe but god had placed in them the
[1:29:10] ability to understand spiritually the
[1:29:14] times
[1:29:15] and he gave them voices so that they
[1:29:17] might speak to those in leadership so
[1:29:20] that israel might be moving when they
[1:29:23] need to move
[1:29:24] and camping when they needed to camp
[1:29:26] don't lose me
[1:29:29] so that they might be raising up when
[1:29:31] they needed to raise up when they might
[1:29:34] need to lay low then they would be
[1:29:36] directed to layla
[1:29:38] it was the responsibility
[1:29:41] of a portion of a tribe
[1:29:44] not all 12 tribes
[1:29:47] a portion of a tribe and this wasn't
[1:29:49] really a tribe it was a family in a
[1:29:52] tribe
[1:29:53] and they were chosen and gifted and
[1:29:57] graced with the ability to understand
[1:30:00] the times so everybody in a community
[1:30:02] may not understand the times but god let
[1:30:05] there be those among your bride
[1:30:09] sin since we're just a remnant of the
[1:30:11] bride anyway lord i wish we could all
[1:30:14] i wish we could all understand the times
[1:30:18] and what you would have us to do as
[1:30:20] brother greeley preached to us last week
[1:30:22] the royal seed of abraham are you still
[1:30:26] here
[1:30:29] so
[1:30:30] you know if you don't know when to do
[1:30:32] what and you don't understand the day
[1:30:35] you're living in
[1:30:36] you might be trying to get a suntan in
[1:30:38] the winter
[1:30:40] you might be trying to shovel snow in
[1:30:42] the summertime
[1:30:45] that would be in the wrong season
[1:30:47] well
[1:30:48] it's according to where you're living
[1:30:49] right
[1:30:50] you've been working too hard at
[1:30:52] something that wasn't in god's timing
[1:30:55] maybe you're doing the right labor
[1:30:57] maybe you're doing all the right things
[1:31:00] but doing them in the wrong season
[1:31:02] perhaps you've been planning a summer
[1:31:04] vegetable garden when it's too late in
[1:31:06] the season to do that
[1:31:08] it's time to reap a summer harvest
[1:31:11] so you can put winter vegetables in
[1:31:13] because you can't plant winter
[1:31:15] vegetables in the heat of the summer
[1:31:17] they'll die before they ever bring fruit
[1:31:20] if you're busy digging in the dirt
[1:31:22] when it's time to be picking fruit and
[1:31:24] plucking what you've planted you'll
[1:31:26] never get your harvest gathered how many
[1:31:29] of you can understand it that way you're
[1:31:31] going to miss out on a tremendous
[1:31:32] blessing in your life if you're doing
[1:31:34] the right thing in the wrong season or
[1:31:36] the wrong thing in the right season and
[1:31:38] so it's important that we ask the lord
[1:31:41] what is my season what is this season
[1:31:45] look like for me
[1:31:47] now we understand that we have to
[1:31:49] capture this as individuals
[1:31:51] as individual believers in the body of
[1:31:54] christ we need to be able to discern
[1:31:56] where we are for ourselves
[1:31:58] and for our families
[1:32:00] then we have to discover how that
[1:32:03] interacts
[1:32:04] how that compounds with other people's
[1:32:07] seasons
[1:32:11] who are also in the body
[1:32:13] who are also a part of the family amen
[1:32:16] because you may be going through a
[1:32:18] season of grief
[1:32:20] and you may be highly offended at the
[1:32:23] one next to you who's going through a
[1:32:25] season of rejoicing
[1:32:30] there's a lot of people that get
[1:32:32] offended if you're not grieving when
[1:32:33] they're grieving
[1:32:35] or if you're not dancing when they're
[1:32:37] dancing
[1:32:38] but we have to understand too everything
[1:32:40] there's a season
[1:32:41] there's a time to grieve there's a time
[1:32:43] to rejoice
[1:32:45] that doesn't mean that uh we will always
[1:32:48] be at the same season
[1:32:50] at the same time but we discover first
[1:32:53] let me restate it we discover first
[1:32:56] where am i
[1:32:57] in what god wants to do right now
[1:33:00] where am i what does god want to do in
[1:33:02] me
[1:33:04] to get me ready for what he wants to do
[1:33:06] in us
[1:33:07] hello
[1:33:09] it's a very very i'm going to get
[1:33:10] through this i am i'm determined
[1:33:13] i want you to hear it and what you do
[1:33:16] with it is on you brother sister but
[1:33:18] it's on me to get it to you and i'm
[1:33:20] going to do it by his grace i want you
[1:33:22] to hear it and hear it well it's every
[1:33:25] man's responsibility every woman's
[1:33:27] responsibility to hear from god for your
[1:33:31] life
[1:33:32] what is your season right now are you to
[1:33:35] be planting
[1:33:36] or should you already be reaping
[1:33:39] now we understand that there are so many
[1:33:42] things like this that can kind of lap
[1:33:44] over
[1:33:45] and we understand that there are times
[1:33:47] that god lets us come into fellowship
[1:33:49] with others in the body who are going
[1:33:51] through the same kind of season
[1:33:53] amen and we also understand that
[1:33:56] sometimes we get stuck
[1:33:59] in seasons
[1:34:00] and we take that as our identity
[1:34:03] and we own our sickness
[1:34:08] and it becomes who we are
[1:34:10] now i want you to know it didn't come to
[1:34:13] stay
[1:34:16] it didn't come to stay
[1:34:18] it came to pass
[1:34:20] so you've got to know when to turn loose
[1:34:22] of it
[1:34:23] so that you can step into your healing
[1:34:25] right
[1:34:27] the difficulty whatever it is that
[1:34:29] you're going through that's crippled you
[1:34:31] and handicapped you it's for a season
[1:34:34] it didn't come to stay
[1:34:36] it came to pass
[1:34:38] you've got to discern when it's time to
[1:34:40] step out of that
[1:34:44] i've had people ask me
[1:34:46] how long should a widow mourn
[1:34:50] well
[1:34:51] as long as she needs to
[1:34:54] but she must not let that become
[1:34:57] her identity
[1:34:59] she's not born to be a mourner
[1:35:01] she's born to be a lover
[1:35:04] she's born to love
[1:35:06] she's created to reflect his love but
[1:35:09] there's a season to mourn
[1:35:12] and sometimes
[1:35:13] you you might get out of it quicker
[1:35:16] i've had people ask me things like you
[1:35:18] know in the old days
[1:35:20] women would wear black
[1:35:23] and that was all they'd wear
[1:35:25] for weeks and months
[1:35:28] after their companion died
[1:35:31] and they would feel awful
[1:35:34] when they started wearing a color again
[1:35:37] you understand
[1:35:38] i've had people ask me questions like
[1:35:41] when is it all right for someone who's
[1:35:43] lost their companion to death to start
[1:35:46] thinking about it there is no answer for
[1:35:48] that
[1:35:49] how many of you know we don't have any
[1:35:51] rules for that
[1:35:53] when god should open your heart he will
[1:35:55] open your heart if god has that for you
[1:35:58] he has that for you but don't ever think
[1:36:02] that you
[1:36:03] should always be
[1:36:06] in the same season
[1:36:08] in your life because spiritually they
[1:36:11] change all the time
[1:36:13] and we have to be able to keep up with
[1:36:14] what god is doing sometimes it gives us
[1:36:17] almost uh whiplash because we come so
[1:36:21] quickly out of another season and one
[1:36:23] that is moved very quickly and then all
[1:36:26] of a sudden we're like a turtle trying
[1:36:27] to pace our way through the next one we
[1:36:30] have to just walk in his peace we have
[1:36:32] to let his joy be a part of our life we
[1:36:35] have to reach down and get it we have to
[1:36:37] try to remember that we're not the only
[1:36:39] ones who have gone through very very
[1:36:41] dark and difficult things in their life
[1:36:44] how did they get through it well i don't
[1:36:45] know how they all got through it but i
[1:36:47] know how some got through it they got
[1:36:49] through it because of him they got
[1:36:52] through it because of jesus and if you
[1:36:54] and i get through this we're going to
[1:36:56] get through it
[1:36:58] because of jesus
[1:37:00] are you here
[1:37:01] stay right with me if you if you can
[1:37:04] so
[1:37:05] no wonder we get so discouraged
[1:37:08] no wonder we get so disheartened
[1:37:10] because we're working so hard sometime
[1:37:13] and we're seeing such little results
[1:37:16] and that is because we forget
[1:37:18] that there are times of heavy intense
[1:37:21] labor
[1:37:23] sometimes they go on years go on and
[1:37:26] years go on and years go on and then all
[1:37:28] of a sudden you step into a time of
[1:37:31] reaping what you have sown
[1:37:33] and boy you want to stay there forever
[1:37:34] don't you
[1:37:36] and sometimes that's a lot shorter than
[1:37:38] the than the planting season to get you
[1:37:40] there
[1:37:40] you're just about getting used to
[1:37:42] reaping
[1:37:43] whoa
[1:37:45] you're just about enjoying you know i
[1:37:47] got a raise
[1:37:48] i got this i got that you get real happy
[1:37:51] about that and real comfortable with
[1:37:53] that and then you go into another season
[1:37:55] where it's hard labor
[1:37:57] keep pressing
[1:37:59] keep digging
[1:38:01] keep planting
[1:38:03] keep moving it's not over till it's over
[1:38:06] how many of you believe that so don't
[1:38:08] measure your seasons by the results you
[1:38:10] feel right now
[1:38:12] because all of that can change and it
[1:38:16] can change so quickly and for some i've
[1:38:18] seen that happen
[1:38:20] second corinthians chapter 6
[1:38:22] and verse 2
[1:38:24] for he saith
[1:38:25] i have heard thee in a time accepted
[1:38:29] and in the day of salvation have i
[1:38:32] suchered thee behold now is the accepted
[1:38:37] time behold now is the day of salvation
[1:38:42] i hold on to that i know the lord is our
[1:38:45] deliverer i know the lord is our
[1:38:48] salvation let's look at that in the
[1:38:50] amplified
[1:38:52] for he says
[1:38:54] in the time of favor
[1:38:57] of an assured welcome
[1:39:01] i have listened to
[1:39:03] and heeded your call
[1:39:07] i have helped you
[1:39:09] on the day of deliverance
[1:39:11] the time of the day
[1:39:14] of salvation
[1:39:15] behold now is truly the time for a
[1:39:19] gracious welcome and acceptance of you
[1:39:23] from god behold now is the day of
[1:39:27] salvation he was always the savior
[1:39:31] he was always the savior
[1:39:34] but there was an appointed day for him
[1:39:36] to come to the rescue of his people
[1:39:40] there was a duration in the battle
[1:39:43] and then he came
[1:39:45] you got to fight your way until the day
[1:39:47] of victory and i feel like i'm
[1:39:50] i feel almost embarrassed to say that to
[1:39:52] you people
[1:39:53] because you have fought
[1:39:56] but i have to remind you
[1:39:58] you can't stop now
[1:40:00] you got to keep on pressing in
[1:40:03] because there's a promise to be found in
[1:40:06] him
[1:40:07] so we can say because the word says i
[1:40:09] can say because the word says
[1:40:12] now is the day of salvation now is the
[1:40:16] accepted time now will the lord deliver
[1:40:19] us
[1:40:20] don't miss your time there's a very
[1:40:22] specific word from god
[1:40:24] for specific people
[1:40:26] at specific times don't ever forget
[1:40:29] that's the message you believe
[1:40:31] don't ever forget that the message you
[1:40:33] believe was a specific message
[1:40:36] to be given to a specific people
[1:40:39] in a specific hour
[1:40:41] if you don't have anything else to be
[1:40:43] thankful for you can be thankful for
[1:40:44] that
[1:40:45] millions and billions of people living
[1:40:48] in the same hour that you're living in
[1:40:51] and god has allowed you to hear a
[1:40:54] specific message
[1:40:56] in a specific time
[1:40:58] and as brother greeley encouraged us we
[1:41:00] need to hear
[1:41:02] that ministry
[1:41:03] we need to hear what god has saved for
[1:41:06] us
[1:41:07] and stored for us in this hour
[1:41:10] we need to hear that we need to get it
[1:41:13] in our spirit we must be intentional
[1:41:16] here's what we're missing we must be
[1:41:18] intentional in our efforts to discern
[1:41:21] what god is saying in this season
[1:41:24] we shut him down we didn't like what he
[1:41:26] said the last time
[1:41:28] or we didn't see enough fruit from what
[1:41:29] we heard the last time come on hello if
[1:41:33] i can get through this part i'll make it
[1:41:39] you know god's been good to us through
[1:41:41] the years
[1:41:43] to help us focus a little bit but it
[1:41:45] don't work if you don't work it
[1:41:49] it won't work for you if you don't work
[1:41:51] it
[1:41:52] it'll work for everybody around you but
[1:41:54] it won't work for you if you don't work
[1:41:55] it how do you work it you put your faith
[1:41:57] there
[1:41:58] you step out of your grumbling and you
[1:42:00] step into a faith-filled attitude come
[1:42:03] on one that's grateful for what god did
[1:42:06] it grieves me when i realize there's
[1:42:08] people here that don't feel blessed
[1:42:12] it grieves me what do you mean you don't
[1:42:15] feel blessed
[1:42:17] without his favor without his without
[1:42:20] his without him
[1:42:22] we can't draw another breath
[1:42:25] oh my i know things don't always turn
[1:42:28] out the way that we want them to turn
[1:42:29] out but god is good and not only is he
[1:42:32] good his goodness is chasing
[1:42:35] chasing after us you understand it all i
[1:42:38] do not i do not understand why we lost a
[1:42:41] rabbi
[1:42:42] i don't know why we lost a friend this
[1:42:44] week
[1:42:45] 62 years old or something like that
[1:42:48] young
[1:42:49] 68 sorry 68 years old young
[1:42:53] smart
[1:42:55] spiritual
[1:42:57] a natural seed
[1:43:00] of king david
[1:43:02] truly
[1:43:03] truly a family that can trace their
[1:43:06] heritage back to king david
[1:43:09] their their royalty
[1:43:12] their royalty
[1:43:13] and he had good days and bad days
[1:43:16] he had a lot going on
[1:43:18] and there was a lot of prayer
[1:43:21] that went up for him
[1:43:22] and nobody i don't know anybody of all
[1:43:25] of his friends and loved ones i don't
[1:43:28] know and you even you people who loved
[1:43:30] him and who knew him and who he
[1:43:32] ministered to us here
[1:43:34] on at least two occasions
[1:43:36] nobody was ready for him to go
[1:43:39] but god was
[1:43:44] god was
[1:43:45] i refuse
[1:43:47] you do whatever you have to do to make
[1:43:48] yourself feel better
[1:43:50] but i refused to get in that game
[1:43:53] if he'd better had a better hospital if
[1:43:55] he'd had a better doctor if he had a
[1:43:57] better medicine if he'd had another
[1:44:01] come on folks
[1:44:02] this is a slippery slope
[1:44:05] that will move your life out of faith
[1:44:08] and into fear
[1:44:10] oh
[1:44:11] no
[1:44:12] god knew exactly where he would be
[1:44:17] he could have been in
[1:44:18] arizona he had just been in arizona but
[1:44:22] god knew exactly where he would be and
[1:44:24] god knew the doctor
[1:44:27] i think about when joshua
[1:44:29] when his tooth and all went through his
[1:44:32] cheek there
[1:44:33] and he went through so much in israel
[1:44:36] and we check in first hospital wouldn't
[1:44:38] see us they just turned us away and sent
[1:44:40] us out to the very hospital where the
[1:44:42] rabbi passed away and we go walking in
[1:44:45] there the blood's still running down his
[1:44:46] chin we're going to have to have a
[1:44:48] plastic surgeon we're going to have to
[1:44:49] have this we're going to have to have
[1:44:50] that we're feeling fearful as parents
[1:44:53] all these kind of thing we get in there
[1:44:55] they start questioning us take us ahead
[1:44:58] of all those people in the waiting room
[1:45:00] and finally a doctor comes in and says
[1:45:02] i don't believe this
[1:45:05] but the leading pediatric plastic
[1:45:08] surgeon in the nation
[1:45:10] was in
[1:45:11] the parking garage
[1:45:13] on his way home he's not even normally
[1:45:16] at this hospital and we have called him
[1:45:18] and he's coming up to take a look
[1:45:22] has god done things like that in your
[1:45:24] life
[1:45:25] now tell me god didn't know what he was
[1:45:26] doing
[1:45:27] tell me that accident took god by
[1:45:29] surprise
[1:45:30] no no no
[1:45:32] he had the right one at the right time
[1:45:34] at the right place to give us what we
[1:45:36] needed don't you allow your life your
[1:45:40] mind your thoughts to go down that slope
[1:45:43] i truly believe that the hospitals are a
[1:45:46] very dangerous place to be right now
[1:45:48] but i want you to know that if god is
[1:45:51] with you
[1:45:54] it doesn't matter whether you're in the
[1:45:55] lion's den
[1:45:57] or whether you're in the icu
[1:46:00] there's not one thing the enemy is going
[1:46:02] to be able to do to you
[1:46:04] until god says so
[1:46:06] there's a time to be born and there's a
[1:46:09] time to die
[1:46:10] somebody said am i supposed to feel good
[1:46:12] about that it's the only way for you to
[1:46:15] have peace for your own future
[1:46:20] it's the only way to have peace for your
[1:46:22] own future
[1:46:24] is to put your faith and your trust and
[1:46:26] your hope in him and i'm telling you
[1:46:28] this is an hour to put your faith where
[1:46:30] your mouth has been
[1:46:31] what you've said we're now being tested
[1:46:34] on what we have said and god's giving us
[1:46:37] an opportunity to prove yes i'll trust
[1:46:40] him though he slay me
[1:46:42] though he slay me yet i will trust him
[1:46:47] oh what other choice do i have what
[1:46:50] other choice do you have we have none
[1:46:53] can somebody say we have none
[1:46:55] this this was all sort of stirring in my
[1:46:58] spirit thank you for your prayers i've
[1:47:00] been teaching a class on wednesdays on
[1:47:03] zoom i was so nervous about zoom i'd
[1:47:06] never i know i'm the only person in the
[1:47:08] whole world that didn't know how to do
[1:47:10] zoom
[1:47:11] because that's been the way but i didn't
[1:47:12] know how and it made me nervous thank
[1:47:14] god for hulk thank god for those who can
[1:47:16] help you get through it but i've been
[1:47:17] teaching my class on wednesdays and that
[1:47:20] this is some of what has been stirring
[1:47:22] in my heart
[1:47:23] and uh i shared with him in the first
[1:47:25] class about the vision of those climbing
[1:47:28] mount zion and swallowing the fire this
[1:47:31] week when we came on they told me
[1:47:33] there's a lady here who had painted a
[1:47:36] picture prior to the class of the
[1:47:38] mountain and fire coming out of the
[1:47:40] mountain as a confirmation boy that'll
[1:47:43] stir you
[1:47:44] that'll stir you to know that god was
[1:47:46] laying a foundation and that caused her
[1:47:48] to want to hear and that caused others
[1:47:50] to want to hear that's how god works so
[1:47:53] i've been kind of stirred in some of
[1:47:55] those things that i was sharing and i
[1:47:57] read to them just like i read to you
[1:47:59] recently luke chapter 4
[1:48:02] and this great especially verse 19
[1:48:06] but it's just too good not to read 18
[1:48:08] and 19 he is receiving the scroll of
[1:48:12] isaiah he has opened it up and the place
[1:48:15] has been found where he should read and
[1:48:17] he reads the spirit of the lord is upon
[1:48:20] me because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:48:23] the gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[1:48:25] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[1:48:27] deliverance to the captives and
[1:48:29] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[1:48:31] at liberty them that are bruised and
[1:48:32] then verse 19 to pray why don't we read
[1:48:35] it together it's short to preach the
[1:48:37] acceptable year of the lord
[1:48:41] now everybody in this room has not been
[1:48:44] called to preach with words
[1:48:46] or to preach behind a desk
[1:48:48] but every person in this room has been
[1:48:51] called to preach with your life
[1:48:54] we are
[1:48:55] and we do
[1:48:57] sometimes it's pretty rotten sermons
[1:49:01] but we're preaching
[1:49:04] you know we're preaching to those we
[1:49:05] work with
[1:49:08] we're preaching to those that we are in
[1:49:10] fellowship with those that we meet along
[1:49:12] the way we're preaching at those who cut
[1:49:14] us off
[1:49:16] folks i i don't think that i'm wrong in
[1:49:18] this but i've never seen i've never seen
[1:49:20] anything quite like what i've been
[1:49:22] seeing in this la with people driving
[1:49:28] you be careful please please please
[1:49:31] please be careful
[1:49:33] my grandfather told my mother when she
[1:49:35] was learning to drive it's not just
[1:49:36] watching for yourself it's watching for
[1:49:38] everybody else i tell you it seems more
[1:49:41] true now i've watched people's driving
[1:49:43] get worse
[1:49:44] through the years but i've never seen
[1:49:45] anything quite like this
[1:49:47] i meet people every day that's not an
[1:49:50] exaggeration
[1:49:52] every day on my side of the road
[1:49:54] especially out through here especially
[1:49:56] 379 and 250.
[1:49:58] of all the places i go those are two of
[1:50:01] the worst places that i drive where
[1:50:02] people are literally over and you pass
[1:50:04] them
[1:50:06] of course i don't want to mention those
[1:50:07] people that will stop right in the
[1:50:08] middle of the road when you don't have
[1:50:10] time to put on brakes because of turtles
[1:50:13] crossing the road
[1:50:17] i don't have nothing against turtles do
[1:50:19] you
[1:50:20] but i like people
[1:50:23] i think a people's life is a lot more
[1:50:25] important than that little turtle's life
[1:50:27] if you can pull over in safety and help
[1:50:29] that little turtle i believe god will
[1:50:30] bless you for doing that but if you're
[1:50:32] gonna put somebody else in harm's way to
[1:50:34] save that turtle just swerve a little
[1:50:36] bit and keep right on going
[1:50:38] let's see brother skip was telling us
[1:50:39] about an experience he had and i had one
[1:50:41] on the way home last night very similar
[1:50:43] to yours where we almost did the very
[1:50:45] almost the same thing happened to you
[1:50:47] happen to us
[1:50:48] you're just you just have to watch
[1:50:51] you just have to be alert
[1:50:53] because it's so dangerous and people's
[1:50:55] minds are so distracted
[1:50:58] and and they're pull out they'll see you
[1:51:00] coming and pull out in front of you and
[1:51:02] how you sail by them preaches
[1:51:09] how you look at them when they go by
[1:51:12] when you go by them
[1:51:15] it preaches
[1:51:17] every one of us is preaching
[1:51:20] with our words with our lives with our
[1:51:23] attitudes with our actions
[1:51:25] our families are watching us
[1:51:28] our neighbors are watching us
[1:51:30] we have no excuse but to reflect the
[1:51:32] goodness of god and what he has done in
[1:51:35] our life
[1:51:36] i'm so thankful to be able to recognize
[1:51:39] that there are certain seasons to preach
[1:51:42] certain things
[1:51:44] there are certain seasons to receive
[1:51:47] certain truths
[1:51:50] if we could ever get a body a group of
[1:51:52] people at the same place
[1:51:55] ready to hear the same thing
[1:51:57] at the same time we would have no
[1:51:59] troubles
[1:52:00] just think about it but it's nearly
[1:52:02] impossible and god knows that he knew
[1:52:05] that when he chose the foolishness of
[1:52:06] preaching don't sleep yet
[1:52:09] wake your neighbor
[1:52:10] not quite yet
[1:52:12] i want you to hold on a little while
[1:52:13] longer
[1:52:15] god knew that when he chose the
[1:52:17] foolishness of preaching if we could get
[1:52:19] everybody ready to hear the same thing
[1:52:22] at the same time maybe we could really
[1:52:25] go someplace but that's not the way it's
[1:52:27] been designed it's designed that we are
[1:52:30] in different seasons and cycles of our
[1:52:32] life
[1:52:33] and some of us don't even know what
[1:52:35] season we're in or what cycle we're in
[1:52:37] we don't even know how to define it
[1:52:39] therefore we have no idea how to work
[1:52:42] with anybody else
[1:52:44] to cooperate with anybody else we don't
[1:52:47] know how to be a part of community
[1:52:49] i'm going to preach a little bit here
[1:52:51] we don't know how to be a part of a
[1:52:52] bigger family
[1:52:54] we don't know how to think about others
[1:52:57] and how what we do really matters
[1:53:01] you know you ever notice sometimes
[1:53:04] like newlyweds or something like that
[1:53:06] as soon as they get married and their
[1:53:08] little lives begin to grow and blossom
[1:53:11] and bud they forget about how quickly
[1:53:14] they forget about those others behind
[1:53:16] them that ain't married yet
[1:53:20] have you ever noticed anything like that
[1:53:22] don't get quiet
[1:53:25] michael hear me
[1:53:28] you all made me be obvious i wasn't even
[1:53:30] trying to be obvious david hear me
[1:53:32] i'm just talking about something i've
[1:53:34] noticed in in life
[1:53:37] and you move up into a new class
[1:53:39] you're in the married class now
[1:53:41] well let me remind you married people
[1:53:44] everybody around you is not married
[1:53:51] so you ought to be
[1:53:52] careful about how you preach
[1:53:57] because those some of those other single
[1:53:58] people there that hadn't quite made it
[1:54:00] to your place they struggle with the
[1:54:02] same thoughts and desires
[1:54:05] that you struggled with so we don't see
[1:54:06] you rubbing on each other
[1:54:11] there's a time and a season for that
[1:54:14] there's a place for that
[1:54:16] don't forget where you came from
[1:54:20] don't forget who helped you get to where
[1:54:22] you are
[1:54:23] don't forget your old crew
[1:54:25] bring them with you the best you can
[1:54:27] pray for them and help them along the
[1:54:29] way come on now but your life is
[1:54:32] preaching
[1:54:34] your intimacy is private it's not public
[1:54:37] it's not for church it's not for where
[1:54:40] church people are gathered
[1:54:42] i don't mean a peck on the cheek i don't
[1:54:44] mean a gentle touch i don't mean that i
[1:54:46] think you know what i mean
[1:54:48] we're not all in the same season
[1:54:51] some people are struggling they're not
[1:54:54] married and they're struggling just like
[1:54:57] you are struggling i could go on i could
[1:54:59] go through so many examples i don't mean
[1:55:01] to pick on the widows this morning but
[1:55:03] it's another example when a woman loses
[1:55:05] her husband her seasons change
[1:55:08] and many times they have been close to
[1:55:10] other married couples
[1:55:12] and now all of a sudden
[1:55:15] i'm not a couple anymore do you
[1:55:16] understand seasons change so it behooves
[1:55:20] us as a family of god to be sensitive
[1:55:23] to that kind of a thing and say hey
[1:55:26] now how many of you know nobody likes to
[1:55:27] be a loose wheel
[1:55:29] extra wheel spare tire i'll get it out
[1:55:31] in a minute
[1:55:32] nobody likes to be that but sometimes we
[1:55:34] have to do a little pulling
[1:55:37] to pull people back because listen your
[1:55:40] season right now is not your full
[1:55:42] identity
[1:55:44] what you're going through right now is
[1:55:47] not all you are
[1:55:49] and it doesn't define your future
[1:55:52] you are going through and walking
[1:55:54] through this season in cycle because god
[1:55:56] wants to talk to you
[1:55:58] he wants to work in your life he wants
[1:56:00] to move on your behalf he wants to help
[1:56:04] you
[1:56:05] what you may feel like is the most
[1:56:07] difficult season of your life may only
[1:56:09] be
[1:56:10] the preamble
[1:56:13] for even a darker one
[1:56:15] and a more difficult one
[1:56:17] so you want to get all you can out of
[1:56:19] where you are and you want to look
[1:56:21] forward with hope you want to believe
[1:56:22] that god has something
[1:56:24] and that you're preaching counts and
[1:56:27] that your life counts even if it's not
[1:56:29] in the pulpit and you want to show
[1:56:31] people that jesus is always the answer
[1:56:33] he's the answer in 2021 he's the answer
[1:56:36] in 2022. he's the answer in 5781 he's
[1:56:40] the answer in 5782
[1:56:42] and the truth is the truth whether you
[1:56:44] can amend it or not
[1:56:45] the truth is the truth
[1:56:47] whether you can put your little amen in
[1:56:49] it or not it's going to stand when the
[1:56:51] world is on fire no doubt about it look
[1:56:53] at hebrews 1 1
[1:56:55] god who at sundry times and in diverse
[1:56:58] manners
[1:57:00] spake in time past unto the fathers by
[1:57:03] the prophets
[1:57:05] in the amplified it says
[1:57:07] well i got to hurry
[1:57:09] in the amplified it says and many
[1:57:11] separate revelations
[1:57:13] each of which set forth a portion of the
[1:57:15] truth
[1:57:17] and in different ways god spoke of old
[1:57:20] to our forefathers in
[1:57:23] and by
[1:57:25] the prophets
[1:57:26] separate revelations and each of those
[1:57:28] separate revelations only bringing forth
[1:57:30] a portion of the truth
[1:57:32] and then truth has to lay on truth has
[1:57:34] to lay on truth has to lay on truth line
[1:57:36] upon line and precept upon precept do
[1:57:39] you understand that and i want to want
[1:57:41] to call your attention to the word in
[1:57:43] the king james divers
[1:57:45] diverse manners
[1:57:47] god doesn't just speak in one way
[1:57:49] i want you to hear it
[1:57:51] god speaks in many many many ways
[1:57:55] he would love to speak to you from
[1:57:56] behind this desk
[1:57:58] that's how god would love to speak to
[1:58:00] you time and time and time again because
[1:58:02] there are seasons in your life when you
[1:58:04] can't hear him for yourself i've been
[1:58:06] there
[1:58:07] you're preaching down to me no
[1:58:09] not at all i'm telling you i've been
[1:58:11] there so i know what it feels like and
[1:58:13] he would like to be able to talk but
[1:58:14] sometimes we're not in a season to be
[1:58:17] able to hear from this desk
[1:58:18] so he has to use other things
[1:58:21] he's got so many voices we don't know
[1:58:23] how to list them all
[1:58:24] he has so many diverse ways of speaking
[1:58:26] to us even prophetically he speaks to us
[1:58:28] prophetically in nature sometimes
[1:58:30] doesn't he he does lots of things lots
[1:58:33] of things isaiah 28 i want to read these
[1:58:35] scriptures i wish that you would write
[1:58:37] them down because we won't have time to
[1:58:40] talk about them each but i i wish you'd
[1:58:42] mark them down and look at them later
[1:58:44] isaiah 28 9-10 whom shall he teach
[1:58:47] knowledge
[1:58:48] and whom shall he make to understand
[1:58:50] doctrine them that are weaned from the
[1:58:53] milk and drawn from the breast
[1:58:55] are you one of those
[1:58:57] are you one of those has been weaned
[1:58:59] from the from the milk and drawn from
[1:59:01] the breast for precept must be upon
[1:59:04] precept precept upon precept lying upon
[1:59:08] line lying upon line here a little and
[1:59:12] there a little it's not god giving all
[1:59:14] to one
[1:59:16] it's god giving pieces
[1:59:20] to each one
[1:59:22] who has a heart to hear
[1:59:23] remember first we discover where we are
[1:59:27] in our season what's my season what am i
[1:59:30] walking through right now how is god
[1:59:32] talking to me how does he desire to talk
[1:59:34] to me what is he trying to accomplish in
[1:59:37] my life right now then we have to
[1:59:39] consider how does that work
[1:59:41] how do i place that with the body
[1:59:46] you may be going through the long dark
[1:59:47] night of the soul
[1:59:49] no one else in the building may be going
[1:59:51] through the long dark night of the soul
[1:59:53] come on
[1:59:54] it's hard
[1:59:56] it's hard to be the only one
[1:59:59] it's hard to be the only one
[2:00:01] you've got to figure out how how do i
[2:00:02] not
[2:00:03] pull completely away from the rest of
[2:00:05] the body and then we as a body we have
[2:00:07] to be able to discern what's my season
[2:00:09] and how do i how do i walk it out and
[2:00:11] how do i relate to somebody who's in the
[2:00:13] long dark night of the soul come on
[2:00:16] what is what is my ministry what is my
[2:00:19] responsibility in an hour like that now
[2:00:21] i understand that people many people are
[2:00:23] not open to really any kind of ministry
[2:00:25] except a pat on the back
[2:00:27] and for someone to tell them how good
[2:00:28] they're doing
[2:00:29] but we have to be willing sometime
[2:00:32] to receive whatever the lord is giving
[2:00:34] us
[2:00:35] because it's the only way we can grow in
[2:00:37] him
[2:00:38] i think god knows that don't you
[2:00:40] he said in isaiah 28 9.
[2:00:44] uh we read that did we do it in uh
[2:00:46] amplified
[2:00:48] for it is his prophets repeating over
[2:00:50] and over
[2:00:52] precept upon precept
[2:00:54] you said people get tired of clapping
[2:00:56] their hands
[2:00:58] they're tired of raising their hand
[2:00:59] tired of
[2:01:01] two songs in an offering tired of
[2:01:03] i want you to know this is just the way
[2:01:06] things
[2:01:07] come
[2:01:09] i get tired of hearing if we're
[2:01:11] preaching a long series on the mind i'm
[2:01:12] tired of hearing i'm tired of hearing on
[2:01:14] the thoughts now i've had enough of that
[2:01:15] ready to go on something every time i
[2:01:16] come that's what he's preaching on
[2:01:18] but this is somehow
[2:01:20] oftentimes the way god chooses
[2:01:23] to build things in us
[2:01:25] because he's working on a building
[2:01:27] he's working on a building
[2:01:30] he's working on a building because you
[2:01:32] can't work on one if he's not unless the
[2:01:35] lord built a house
[2:01:37] those who labor labor in vain
[2:01:39] is that right
[2:01:41] psalm 75 and 2 in the amplified
[2:01:44] when the proper time has come
[2:01:47] for executing my judgments i will judge
[2:01:50] uprightly says the lord you don't have
[2:01:52] to worry about his ability
[2:01:54] to give both justice and judgment
[2:01:57] he will do both
[2:01:59] in his
[2:02:00] time
[2:02:01] do you believe that
[2:02:03] go to luke 13 with me quickly
[2:02:07] verse 34. it's uh not quite one but very
[2:02:10] close
[2:02:14] i'm gonna need another one of these
[2:02:15] please pretty
[2:02:16] please oh jerusalem
[2:02:20] jerusalem
[2:02:21] which killeth the prophets
[2:02:23] and stone is them that are sent unto
[2:02:25] thee how often
[2:02:28] would i have gathered thy children
[2:02:31] together as a hen doth gather her brood
[2:02:35] under her wings
[2:02:36] and ye would not can i read it again
[2:02:39] oh jerusalem jerusalem which killeth the
[2:02:43] prophets and stone is them that are sent
[2:02:46] unto thee how often would i have
[2:02:48] gathered thy children together as a hen
[2:02:50] doth gather her brood under her wings
[2:02:52] thank you and ye
[2:02:55] would not this is jesus
[2:03:00] is savior
[2:03:02] this is messiah this is creator
[2:03:05] sitting on a hill are you with me
[2:03:08] looking over the city that he loves so
[2:03:10] much
[2:03:12] he's weeping over her
[2:03:15] he goes on to say behold your house is
[2:03:18] left unto you desolate and verily i say
[2:03:20] unto you you shall not see me until the
[2:03:23] time come when you shall say blessed is
[2:03:26] he that cometh in the name of the lord
[2:03:30] and do you know what he did he left the
[2:03:32] city
[2:03:33] that he loved so much
[2:03:35] to seek a people to find the people who
[2:03:37] were prepared to hear the message that
[2:03:40] he had to deliver that breaks my heart
[2:03:43] i know there was no place on the earth
[2:03:45] that he loved anymore that he loved the
[2:03:47] city of jerusalem how do you know that
[2:03:49] because papa in him did
[2:03:52] the eternal spirit of the father that
[2:03:53] was in our lord jesus christ he loved
[2:03:56] the city of jerusalem but there was such
[2:03:59] a a a complacency
[2:04:02] and even a religious indignation
[2:04:05] that so
[2:04:06] uh
[2:04:08] resisted
[2:04:10] the messages of truth that god would
[2:04:13] send to that people as as a community as
[2:04:15] a city he would send his word again and
[2:04:18] again and again and jesus said i just
[2:04:20] wanted to gather you
[2:04:22] under my wings
[2:04:24] i just wanted to tuck you under my
[2:04:26] breast
[2:04:27] my chest and hold you up close and tell
[2:04:31] you you are mine
[2:04:35] but you would
[2:04:36] not you wouldn't let me draw you
[2:04:41] you refused my invitation
[2:04:44] you chose rather to live in an unsafe
[2:04:47] environment when you could have come and
[2:04:50] tabernacled right here
[2:04:53] under my arms under my loving care and i
[2:04:56] say to you jerusalem
[2:04:58] you'll not see me again until you hear
[2:05:00] those word behold
[2:05:03] he comes we know exactly he's talking
[2:05:05] about his triumphant entry
[2:05:08] where did he go he went out into the
[2:05:10] villages and into the highways and the
[2:05:13] highways into the galil and he began to
[2:05:16] preach to those prepared to hear his
[2:05:17] message
[2:05:19] but it broke his heart
[2:05:21] to be rejected by the people by the
[2:05:25] place by the city that he loved so much
[2:05:27] what was the problem
[2:05:29] what was the problem luke 19 44.
[2:05:33] here's the problem
[2:05:35] this is the problem
[2:05:37] and shall
[2:05:38] lay these
[2:05:40] even with the ground
[2:05:42] and thy children within thee
[2:05:45] and they shall not leave in thee one
[2:05:48] stone
[2:05:49] upon another
[2:05:51] because thou knewest not the time
[2:06:00] of thy visitation
[2:06:03] i want you just to meditate on that a
[2:06:05] minute you that are with me just
[2:06:06] meditate on that just a moment
[2:06:09] you're gonna lose the holiest thing
[2:06:13] that you have clung to all of these
[2:06:14] years you're going to lose your temple
[2:06:19] you're going to lose your church
[2:06:21] listen how many of you
[2:06:23] at least in the media you have walked
[2:06:26] through congress with
[2:06:27] uh congregations around especially
[2:06:30] through the south that lose their church
[2:06:32] in a fire or lose their church in a
[2:06:34] tornado and you see those posts and
[2:06:37] people say and pray for our church and
[2:06:39] pray for us and and i've even seen clips
[2:06:42] of services where the pastor stands out
[2:06:44] in the parking lot on the sunday after
[2:06:47] and he says we're more than a building
[2:06:51] it'll touch your heart it'll make you
[2:06:53] want to send something on a on a gofund
[2:06:55] or whatever you find it'll make you want
[2:06:57] to help them not too long ago a united
[2:07:00] pentecostal church down around
[2:07:01] mississippi just burned to the ground
[2:07:04] and beautiful facility lost and those
[2:07:07] people just standing in the parking lot
[2:07:09] huddled together weeping that touches my
[2:07:11] heart
[2:07:12] we know that the church is not a
[2:07:14] building
[2:07:15] but we also know we appreciate the
[2:07:17] comfortable place that god gives us to
[2:07:19] worship
[2:07:20] and they're not grieving and will not
[2:07:22] always grieve like that they won't
[2:07:24] always be in that place of loss
[2:07:27] because god will make a way
[2:07:29] they'll build it again they'll build it
[2:07:32] better they'll correct the problems with
[2:07:34] the old
[2:07:35] but in that moment
[2:07:38] oh
[2:07:41] any of you ever lost your home to fire
[2:07:45] sister theresa
[2:07:47] horrible
[2:07:49] awful
[2:07:50] your your memories
[2:07:53] you wonder
[2:07:55] you know your records
[2:07:58] your your part of papers
[2:08:01] your picture albums
[2:08:03] the things that make up who you are
[2:08:06] all gone
[2:08:07] in some cases
[2:08:09] lives lost and you're having to start
[2:08:12] over and jesus is standing in the midst
[2:08:14] of his own people and he's saying to
[2:08:16] them you you see this temple look around
[2:08:18] at all this everything you see now it
[2:08:21] won't always look like this there will
[2:08:23] be a time when one stone will not even
[2:08:26] be laying on top of another stone i'm
[2:08:27] telling you that's a lot of destruction
[2:08:30] and here's why it has to happen
[2:08:33] it has to happen because you trusted a
[2:08:36] building
[2:08:39] you trusted the norm you trusted status
[2:08:42] quo
[2:08:43] you trusted the way you had always done
[2:08:46] it and when your answer came and walked
[2:08:48] among you you didn't see him
[2:08:51] you missed the day
[2:08:54] of thy visitation
[2:08:56] this is why jesus was weeping over
[2:08:58] jerusalem in luke chapter 13
[2:09:00] because he knew the time would come that
[2:09:03] the temple would be gone that everything
[2:09:05] the people loved would be taken from
[2:09:07] them and in the moment listen prior to
[2:09:10] that is when he wanted to draw them
[2:09:12] prior to that is when he wanted to draw
[2:09:14] them up and they wouldn't go
[2:09:16] i don't know if you all know the name
[2:09:19] r.c wetzel or not
[2:09:21] but he pastored riverview assembly of
[2:09:23] god church for so many years
[2:09:25] he was the pastor responsible for
[2:09:28] helping
[2:09:29] pastor kilpatrick
[2:09:31] who was down at the brownsville church
[2:09:33] in pensacola florida he was his mentor
[2:09:36] he was somewhat of a mentor of mine when
[2:09:38] i was a boy he had survived polio he had
[2:09:41] been through a lot and there was a great
[2:09:43] fire that destroyed his his family's
[2:09:46] home
[2:09:47] and and the barn
[2:09:49] and it so affected him as a grown man it
[2:09:52] still affected him those childhood
[2:09:54] memories i remember hearing him limp to
[2:09:56] the pulpit
[2:09:57] uh still crippled from polio he would
[2:10:00] limp to the pulpit he would preach and
[2:10:02] teach and tell us some wonderful things
[2:10:05] that god had done in his life and i love
[2:10:07] to hear him talk about that that fire i
[2:10:10] liked one part of it so so good he said
[2:10:14] the house gone the barn gone
[2:10:17] just smoldering
[2:10:19] embers left
[2:10:21] and uh
[2:10:23] he said we went out
[2:10:25] and the livestock gone the pet's gone
[2:10:30] the quilt's gone everything gone
[2:10:33] and he said sitting right in the door of
[2:10:35] a barn of the barn
[2:10:37] was a mother hen
[2:10:39] charred to death
[2:10:41] her feathers melted on her little frame
[2:10:43] but still in place
[2:10:45] he said i didn't mean any harm
[2:10:48] but i could not imagine what made that
[2:10:51] little mother stop
[2:10:53] at the door of that barn she was three
[2:10:56] inches from life three inches from
[2:10:58] safety
[2:10:59] what in the world made her stop right in
[2:11:02] the doorway of the barn and he said i
[2:11:04] didn't mean no harm but i just took the
[2:11:06] edge of my boot and i kicked her over
[2:11:09] just tapped her over and out from under
[2:11:11] her run a whole brood of little chickens
[2:11:15] he said i never had to question again i
[2:11:18] knew immediately why that mother could
[2:11:20] have made it to safety but she wasn't
[2:11:23] sure that her children couldn't make it
[2:11:25] to safety
[2:11:26] and then i would hear brother wetzel say
[2:11:28] oh jerusalem jerusalem
[2:11:32] and my mind would go back to jesus
[2:11:34] jerusalem jerusalem how often i would
[2:11:37] have gathered you as a hen with her own
[2:11:39] and you would not
[2:11:41] and because of that not one stone is
[2:11:43] going to stand on top of another stone
[2:11:45] when we're through
[2:11:47] because this city is going to shake like
[2:11:49] it has never shook before why why
[2:11:52] boiling it down to this jerusalem missed
[2:11:55] the day of her visitation how is it
[2:11:58] possible i don't know
[2:11:59] i don't know but jesus said she missed
[2:12:02] the day of her visitation
[2:12:04] and she paid the price for it would you
[2:12:07] agree
[2:12:07] in a message jehovah jireh i'm not done
[2:12:10] yet
[2:12:12] if you need to go i understand
[2:12:14] paragraph 70
[2:12:16] but before a just god can pour out his
[2:12:19] judgment upon a people he has to make a
[2:12:21] way of escape for everyone who desires
[2:12:24] to receive it
[2:12:26] america
[2:12:29] america
[2:12:32] how often god would have desired to draw
[2:12:36] you under his wings
[2:12:39] come on now
[2:12:40] and shelter you
[2:12:43] and you would not
[2:12:46] you celebrate the wrong things
[2:12:49] you grieve over the wrong things
[2:12:53] you've certainly lost
[2:12:55] your way
[2:12:57] just like jerusalem of old
[2:13:00] i don't know if you saw
[2:13:02] any of the coverage
[2:13:04] uh of the 20th anniversary
[2:13:06] of
[2:13:07] 9 11
[2:13:09] but i watched those 21 minutes
[2:13:12] and for 20 years
[2:13:14] i had not watched the entirety of those
[2:13:17] 21 minutes
[2:13:19] intentionally
[2:13:21] i left the room on more than one
[2:13:22] occasion
[2:13:24] when those 21 minutes of coverage were
[2:13:26] being played because i could not handle
[2:13:29] watching it's it's the most shattering
[2:13:32] 21 minutes of footage you'll ever watch
[2:13:35] in your life perhaps but i made up my
[2:13:38] mind on the 20th anniversary i was going
[2:13:40] to watch all 21 minutes
[2:13:42] and i made sure i was in the right place
[2:13:45] when at the right time when the plane
[2:13:48] would strike the first tower and nobody
[2:13:50] has a problem remembering where you were
[2:13:52] and what you were doing
[2:13:54] and how it affected you and how the
[2:13:56] churches were full
[2:13:58] week after week after week after week
[2:14:00] churches had record attendance after
[2:14:02] that
[2:14:03] and we said we'll never forget we'll
[2:14:06] never forget we'll never forget but i
[2:14:09] want you to know we forgot
[2:14:12] and to prove that we forgot we look what
[2:14:14] we look what happened in november
[2:14:17] we don't say anything else
[2:14:18] america has forgot
[2:14:20] how do you think those soldiers feel
[2:14:22] yesterday i saw some of them interviewed
[2:14:24] how do you think some of those soldiers
[2:14:26] fell who risked their lives
[2:14:29] to put an end to that kind of violence
[2:14:31] to make sure that it never happened in
[2:14:34] america again and then to hear the very
[2:14:36] people
[2:14:37] that they were sent to protect others
[2:14:40] from
[2:14:42] called
[2:14:43] reasonable and
[2:14:45] business-like and
[2:14:46] and cordial
[2:14:49] what a mockery
[2:14:52] see
[2:14:53] it proves what a sad condition our
[2:14:57] nation is in you don't have to say amen
[2:15:00] you're too late you're your opinion's
[2:15:02] too late to matter now
[2:15:04] because the evidence is in the verdict
[2:15:05] is here it's very very sad where we
[2:15:08] stand in this nation but i want you to
[2:15:11] know god can never pour his judgment
[2:15:13] upon a people he has to make a way of
[2:15:15] escape for everyone who desires to
[2:15:18] receive it that means there has to come
[2:15:20] a message there has to come a warning
[2:15:24] because judgment cannot fall without a
[2:15:27] warning
[2:15:30] and he has sent that
[2:15:33] one generation
[2:15:34] ago this nation was indicted for the
[2:15:37] second crucifixion of jesus christ the
[2:15:39] word
[2:15:41] and she has received wave
[2:15:43] after wave
[2:15:45] after wave of hardship
[2:15:47] ever since you can say amen or o me
[2:15:51] and i can tell you that the worst
[2:15:53] is yet to come
[2:15:55] you'd better be one of those
[2:15:58] if he should come and say get under my
[2:16:00] wings
[2:16:02] come on now get under my wings
[2:16:06] you better run with everything you have
[2:16:08] somebody ought to say man you better run
[2:16:10] with everything you have to get under
[2:16:12] those wings
[2:16:13] he said this is your day of visitation
[2:16:15] you might not want to believe it because
[2:16:17] an uneducated minister said it
[2:16:19] but don't pay no attention to the
[2:16:21] messenger
[2:16:23] pay attention to the message you're
[2:16:25] hearing
[2:16:26] now let us pray
[2:16:28] what a way to end in the sermon and then
[2:16:30] one more in in the message elisha the
[2:16:32] prophet paragraph 61 he's praying
[2:16:35] and he said our heavenly father that's
[2:16:37] the desire of every heart tonight here
[2:16:39] oh look at them lord maybe 15 25 people
[2:16:42] raise their hand they want to receive
[2:16:43] you just now
[2:16:46] oh great spirit that started out back in
[2:16:49] the early age lived in the men who lived
[2:16:51] in the hearts of your prophets and down
[2:16:53] through the age you come and vindicated
[2:16:55] yourself how we can see david climbing
[2:16:57] that mountain looking back over
[2:16:59] jerusalem rejected by his own
[2:17:02] and he wept as he went up the mount and
[2:17:05] just a few hundred years after that we
[2:17:07] see the son of david
[2:17:09] david rejected first
[2:17:11] the first rejected then here we go we
[2:17:14] see the son of david rejected sitting on
[2:17:16] that same mountain saying jerusalem
[2:17:18] jerusalem how oft would i have hovered
[2:17:21] you as a henwood or chick but you would
[2:17:23] not if you'd have only knowed the day
[2:17:27] of your
[2:17:28] visitation
[2:17:30] dear father tonight in my heart
[2:17:33] i feel the holy spirit crying out oh
[2:17:35] america america
[2:17:38] how oft would the holy spirit have given
[2:17:41] you a real outpouring of a revival
[2:17:43] how he would have gathered you and held
[2:17:45] you in safety
[2:17:47] this is 1956
[2:17:49] this is the closing hour of the greatest
[2:17:51] revival that america has ever known
[2:17:55] [Music]
[2:17:56] and here he prays
[2:17:58] oh
[2:18:00] how often would the holy spirit give you
[2:18:02] a real outpouring of revival how he
[2:18:04] would have gathered you and held you in
[2:18:06] safety but i believe you didn't
[2:18:09] understand
[2:18:10] the day of your visitation
[2:18:14] you scorned the prophets you've called
[2:18:17] them fanatics you've put them in jail
[2:18:20] you all
[2:18:21] have off
[2:18:23] would he have
[2:18:24] took you
[2:18:26] and tonight lord to the individual that
[2:18:29] thou seldom deals with the nation but
[2:18:31] you do with individuals and tonight
[2:18:34] hands has went up and wants to embrace
[2:18:35] you lord i pray that the holy spirit
[2:18:38] will show these people
[2:18:41] that you love them
[2:18:43] embrace them into your bosom just now
[2:18:46] and when this service is over father i
[2:18:48] pray they'll go out of here the happiest
[2:18:50] people that there is in chicago
[2:18:52] granite father
[2:18:55] that's what happens when you get under
[2:18:57] his wings
[2:18:59] right in the midst of adversity right in
[2:19:01] the midst of the fire right in the midst
[2:19:02] of your hurt right in the midst of your
[2:19:04] pain when you get under his wings you
[2:19:06] can be the happiest person
[2:19:08] in lee county alabama
[2:19:10] because you know that you know that you
[2:19:12] know that you know that he's holding you
[2:19:14] is anybody here
[2:19:15] anybody here
[2:19:17] now i want a few more moments
[2:19:21] i don't know that i could ever get back
[2:19:22] here so i'm going to do this
[2:19:24] just stay with me a moment now
[2:19:28] here here's something very important
[2:19:30] the antichrist spirit is alive and well
[2:19:33] it's been in the earth since the time of
[2:19:35] our lord
[2:19:36] it's working overtime
[2:19:38] it's trying to deceive a nation even
[2:19:40] right now
[2:19:41] there's so many things going on
[2:19:43] it seems that we're hardly even allowed
[2:19:46] to speak about it even some of you
[2:19:48] resist but i want you to know something
[2:19:50] it's unfolding before your eyes whether
[2:19:52] you can see it or not
[2:19:54] there's no doubt in my mind the boycott
[2:19:56] that brother branham talked about is
[2:19:57] upon us
[2:19:59] we're in the
[2:20:00] beginnings of those seasons that he
[2:20:03] talked about
[2:20:04] where the boycott would fall
[2:20:06] and listen
[2:20:08] if a church doesn't line up
[2:20:12] you heard the same message i've heard
[2:20:14] if a church doesn't line up with what
[2:20:15] the government says
[2:20:17] then he said they'll turn that place
[2:20:19] into a warehouse
[2:20:25] don't you lay out
[2:20:26] don't you lay out a house of god
[2:20:29] don't you sit on your place of ease and
[2:20:31] miss your opportunity to be gathered
[2:20:33] together with the saints
[2:20:34] because there's coming a day
[2:20:36] i hope i'm i hope i'm out of here but
[2:20:38] there's coming a day
[2:20:40] when the boycott falls
[2:20:42] you you do know what he said don't you
[2:20:45] he talked about that mark
[2:20:47] while everybody's worried about a tattoo
[2:20:49] while everybody's worried about getting
[2:20:51] a number on their forehead their hearts
[2:20:52] have already received the mark of the
[2:20:53] beast
[2:20:56] their intellect has already been shifted
[2:20:58] by the spirit of the antichrist so that
[2:21:00] they believe everything they're told
[2:21:03] except the truth
[2:21:05] that's what the antichrist spirit does
[2:21:09] if you don't believe that it was so
[2:21:11] powerful in the garden
[2:21:13] that it caused eve to believe something
[2:21:15] that she was told over
[2:21:18] and above what god had already told her
[2:21:21] that spirit is so cunning
[2:21:24] that trail of the serpent is so cunning
[2:21:27] and it twists like leviathan
[2:21:30] and it's working overtime
[2:21:33] across our nation and across our world
[2:21:36] and there are people who who say well i
[2:21:38] don't know what day that'll be that one
[2:21:40] of these days there they'll come and put
[2:21:42] a number on us and a tattoo on us and so
[2:21:44] forth etc how many of you know the
[2:21:47] prophet of god taught us something a
[2:21:48] whole lot different than just getting
[2:21:50] some number or some mark on your hand he
[2:21:52] said why it's the forehead he said well
[2:21:54] that's the intellect
[2:21:56] and that means that whatever that spirit
[2:21:58] tells you people believe it and they
[2:22:00] line up
[2:22:04] look and they listen folks they didn't
[2:22:06] like it when isaiah said it
[2:22:09] they didn't like it when ezekiel said it
[2:22:11] they didn't like it when jeremiah said
[2:22:12] it they didn't like it when jesus said
[2:22:14] it they're not going to like it when you
[2:22:15] say it and they don't like it when i say
[2:22:17] it either
[2:22:18] but they're going to line up like
[2:22:20] dummies like people who have no ability
[2:22:23] to speak or to think
[2:22:25] or reason for themselves
[2:22:28] and they're going to follow blindly
[2:22:30] whatever they're told
[2:22:31] not because they have a tattoo
[2:22:34] but because they've already received a
[2:22:36] false system
[2:22:37] which is more religious than political
[2:22:39] but in the end they come so close
[2:22:41] together you can hardly tell them apart
[2:22:46] you see while even around the message
[2:22:48] there are so many who are just sure that
[2:22:50] kamala harris is a woman in purple i'm
[2:22:52] still tending to believe
[2:22:55] just like he said it could be
[2:22:58] the catholic church
[2:23:02] more than just a vice president
[2:23:05] more than just a wicked woman
[2:23:07] but a system that's so slick and so sly
[2:23:12] that the people just line up that's
[2:23:14] mainstream why that's mainstream
[2:23:16] christianity that's orthodox
[2:23:18] christianity i'm telling you you know
[2:23:20] and did you hear what the pope said no i
[2:23:22] didn't hear and i'm not really
[2:23:24] interested in what he had to say
[2:23:26] and i don't know if this is the one or
[2:23:27] the next one's the one or the next one's
[2:23:28] one i don't know when he's coming but
[2:23:30] he's coming and one day one's coming out
[2:23:32] of america and when it does you better
[2:23:34] know that you know you're nearly gone
[2:23:38] because those things are unfolding
[2:23:40] before us
[2:23:41] and then you can't somehow invest your
[2:23:44] faith when a sermon comes that says you
[2:23:47] better know your season
[2:23:49] and people will sit back sometime and
[2:23:51] look like i don't know i just don't even
[2:23:53] know what he's talking about
[2:23:55] when in reality you really do
[2:23:58] you really do because you've heard it
[2:23:59] already if you've heard the message you
[2:24:02] really do we're coming into that very
[2:24:04] very serious hour
[2:24:06] very very serious hour
[2:24:08] daniel 7 25 i got to hurry daniel 7 25
[2:24:11] if you need to slip out we understand
[2:24:15] and he shall speak great words against
[2:24:16] the most high
[2:24:18] and shall wear out the saints of the
[2:24:19] most high and think to change times and
[2:24:22] laws
[2:24:24] and they shall be given into his hand
[2:24:26] until a time and times and the dividing
[2:24:30] of time
[2:24:31] this is the spirit of the antichrist
[2:24:34] and what does he want to do he wants to
[2:24:36] change times
[2:24:38] and laws
[2:24:40] he wants to get things all confused in
[2:24:44] the people's minds why because he's the
[2:24:45] great counterfeit
[2:24:47] and what is he the counterfeit to daniel
[2:24:49] 2 20 look at it daniel answered and said
[2:24:51] blessed be the name of god forever and
[2:24:54] ever for wisdom and might are his and he
[2:24:56] changeth the times
[2:24:59] and he changeth the times and the
[2:25:01] seasons
[2:25:02] he removeth kings and setteth up kings
[2:25:10] oh my
[2:25:11] you reckon it's true
[2:25:14] he giveth wisdom unto the wise and
[2:25:16] knowledge
[2:25:18] to them that no understanding
[2:25:21] he revealeth the deep and secret things
[2:25:23] he knoweth what is in the darkness
[2:25:25] and the light dwelleth with him
[2:25:28] so no wonder the antichrist you're still
[2:25:30] able to listen
[2:25:31] so no wonder the antichrist comes along
[2:25:33] and says i'll just mess with times and
[2:25:34] say i'll just take i'll just take some
[2:25:36] authority over that and get things all
[2:25:38] twisted up the enemy doesn't want you to
[2:25:40] know
[2:25:41] where we are in god's timeline
[2:25:44] the enemy doesn't want you to know where
[2:25:46] we are in god's economy but you can know
[2:25:48] do you have the holy ghost
[2:25:49] do you have the holy ghost if you have
[2:25:52] the holy ghost you can know where you
[2:25:53] are
[2:25:54] now i want to take 10 minutes
[2:25:58] and i'll do the rest of this on tuesday
[2:26:00] night i i guess
[2:26:01] maybe it's a more of a tuesday night
[2:26:04] message anyway but i was just building
[2:26:06] to get to something
[2:26:10] one of the ways that god can speak to us
[2:26:14] prophetically
[2:26:16] is by the calendar
[2:26:17] how do i know that because the bible
[2:26:19] said that he sets those lights there in
[2:26:21] the heavens
[2:26:22] to determine times and years
[2:26:26] so god can use the calendar
[2:26:28] he can use the hebrew calendar
[2:26:31] even though it's been greatly adjusted
[2:26:33] through the years
[2:26:35] he can use the gregorian calendar
[2:26:37] even though it's also been adjusted some
[2:26:39] through the years
[2:26:40] because
[2:26:42] it's more than a number to god
[2:26:45] he can speak in so many different ways
[2:26:48] but again one of the ways that he speaks
[2:26:50] is numbers
[2:26:51] have you ever had god speak to you in
[2:26:53] numbers let me see your hand if you've
[2:26:54] ever heard god's voice in a number
[2:26:58] i have
[2:27:01] and i like it
[2:27:02] i'm just not real good at it
[2:27:04] i have a tendency to miss it
[2:27:06] and somebody has to come back and point
[2:27:08] it out to me
[2:27:09] so pray for me i'd like to be a lot more
[2:27:11] sensitive and and catch that
[2:27:13] but we entered in when we left the 5760s
[2:27:17] on the hebrew calendar
[2:27:19] and we came into the to the 56 70s
[2:27:23] excuse me 57 80s when we left the 57 70s
[2:27:27] and came into the 57 80s
[2:27:29] in 2020 we came into 5780
[2:27:32] we are now in 5782
[2:27:35] we changed not only a year but we
[2:27:37] actually changed decades
[2:27:40] and you know this there was a little bit
[2:27:42] mentioned we didn't talk a lot about it
[2:27:43] because it just seems like we have so
[2:27:45] many people that aren't really
[2:27:46] interested in this
[2:27:48] and that's okay it's all right but just
[2:27:50] remember that you may not be but
[2:27:52] somebody else may
[2:27:54] you know it may mean something
[2:27:56] it does in fact mean something to some
[2:27:59] people
[2:28:00] and so we left the decade of the i in a
[2:28:03] y i n
[2:28:04] which was the decade of the i and it was
[2:28:06] about seeing and isn't it interesting
[2:28:08] that when we came out of the decade of
[2:28:10] the eye we entered into the decade of
[2:28:13] the pay
[2:28:14] which is the mouth
[2:28:16] and it isn't an interesting that the
[2:28:17] year on the gregorian calendar that
[2:28:19] changed it all was 2020
[2:28:21] and the first thing you think about when
[2:28:23] you think about 2020 is not the mouth
[2:28:27] you think about the eye
[2:28:29] and you think about 20 20 vision
[2:28:32] i didn't take a lot of time but i was in
[2:28:33] the hospital with my mom every day when
[2:28:36] she had had that last stroke
[2:28:38] and i spent some time studying
[2:28:40] while she was sleeping and i came and
[2:28:42] just brought a little bit i didn't bring
[2:28:44] a whole lot but i just brought a little
[2:28:45] bit as much as most of you could stand
[2:28:48] just a little bit about it
[2:28:50] and i won't have time to go back through
[2:28:51] or try to lay it all out but remember
[2:28:53] that we were seeing in fact we even had
[2:28:56] a brother that was standing here who
[2:28:57] prophesied to us during that time
[2:29:00] that 2020 would be a year of perfect
[2:29:02] vision
[2:29:03] well the problem is 2020 doesn't even
[2:29:06] mean perfect vision do you remember us
[2:29:08] talking about that
[2:29:09] that doesn't mean perfect vision that is
[2:29:11] the measurement of the clarity
[2:29:14] and uh
[2:29:16] being able to to make out with clarity
[2:29:18] what you see from a distance
[2:29:21] of 20 feet
[2:29:23] so one of the 20s in 2020 is 20 feet
[2:29:28] that's not perfect vision
[2:29:30] it means something a little different
[2:29:32] than that
[2:29:33] it actually means the clarity or
[2:29:36] sharpness of vision measured at a
[2:29:39] distance of 20 feet it's actually visual
[2:29:42] acuity
[2:29:43] which is literally the sharpness
[2:29:46] of your vision so the whole theme
[2:29:49] prophetically for for a lot of folks
[2:29:51] around who hear things and pick up
[2:29:53] things in the spirit was
[2:29:54] about seeing
[2:29:57] but we were leaving the decade of seeing
[2:30:00] and we were about to enter a very
[2:30:02] interesting decade we were going to
[2:30:04] enter the decade of the mouth
[2:30:07] isn't that interesting
[2:30:09] would you just show the pay again
[2:30:11] just the i'm not sure if that's i think
[2:30:13] it's probably uh picture one i've only
[2:30:15] got four pictures i think it may be
[2:30:17] picture one
[2:30:19] and just get the letter there just to
[2:30:21] see the hebrew number i think most of
[2:30:23] you know that in hebrew
[2:30:25] every letter has a number
[2:30:28] and they don't write numerals like we do
[2:30:31] they write from their alphabet
[2:30:33] and each of the letters in the hebrew
[2:30:36] alphabet
[2:30:38] uh have a numeric value
[2:30:41] and this has been followed for hundreds
[2:30:44] and hundreds and hundreds of years
[2:30:46] it's very very interesting throughout
[2:30:49] the old testament you can see a lot of
[2:30:52] interesting things and maybe we'll look
[2:30:53] at them another time
[2:30:55] but i would like to at least show you
[2:30:57] what the pay looks like it looks like a
[2:30:59] face
[2:31:00] uh and there's a great reason for that
[2:31:03] because in hebrew your face
[2:31:06] represents you i'm gonna just wait a
[2:31:08] moment and take a sip of water and and
[2:31:10] see if we can get that one up hawkish
[2:31:15] working at it too
[2:31:19] that was more like a guzzle wasn't it
[2:31:26] do we at least see them are they there
[2:31:28] okay
[2:31:30] i want you to
[2:31:32] see it while i say it
[2:31:36] say it again
[2:31:40] soy why did you drain the battery of
[2:31:42] that mouse
[2:31:47] i thought these things only happened to
[2:31:48] me when i'm
[2:31:52] oh praise the lord you want to stand up
[2:31:53] and do jumping jacks
[2:31:57] yeah you sure can
[2:31:59] i'm nearly done but i'm not counting
[2:32:01] this on my 10 minutes
[2:32:04] the battery's not my fault not their
[2:32:06] fault either
[2:32:08] pay
[2:32:11] you see how it's shaped it's shaped like
[2:32:13] a face
[2:32:15] you see that it has a mouth
[2:32:18] of course there's a whole lot we can say
[2:32:19] about that image right there but we'll
[2:32:21] just leave it like that
[2:32:23] you remember because we showed you the
[2:32:25] i.e
[2:32:27] and for 10 years for a decade
[2:32:31] because of the 80 57 80 57 81 57 82 and
[2:32:37] it goes on that means the whole decade
[2:32:40] is a decade where the letter for the
[2:32:43] decade is a pay which is the number 80
[2:32:46] in value
[2:32:49] last year it was the pay and the olive
[2:32:52] which is the is the father it's the
[2:32:54] beginning it's the first of the letters
[2:32:57] and there's a whole lot that we can say
[2:32:59] about that but we won't take the time
[2:33:01] right now to do it that's good now i can
[2:33:03] see that that looks really good
[2:33:06] but i wanted you to get the image of a
[2:33:08] face and a mouth and i wanted you to
[2:33:10] know that this was changing
[2:33:13] uh in 5780 as we were ending 2019 coming
[2:33:18] into 2020
[2:33:20] and does anybody know what all was going
[2:33:22] on in the earth did you know that
[2:33:24] there's a research project going on
[2:33:26] right now
[2:33:27] to
[2:33:28] investigate a case of covid in alabama
[2:33:33] in december of 2019.
[2:33:36] there's a whole group
[2:33:38] of scientists that are studying and they
[2:33:40] know that there was at least one case in
[2:33:43] alabama in december of 2019
[2:33:47] and it was diagnosed as an unknown virus
[2:33:51] but now they're taking their their they
[2:33:53] have the ability to take the makeup of
[2:33:55] that virus and compare it and they're
[2:33:57] believing that it was here in a general
[2:33:59] form in december of 2019
[2:34:02] we we move into
[2:34:05] 2020
[2:34:06] as we start approaching then uh several
[2:34:09] months into 5780
[2:34:11] and
[2:34:12] it's supposed to be about the mouth it's
[2:34:15] supposed to be about decreeing it's
[2:34:17] supposed to be about your words it's
[2:34:20] supposed to be about your face
[2:34:22] because in hebrew your face is your
[2:34:24] identity and if you cover up your face
[2:34:27] you lose who you are
[2:34:31] interesting
[2:34:32] interesting you lose your face your face
[2:34:35] is covered
[2:34:37] you lose who you are
[2:34:39] big mistakes can be made
[2:34:42] when somebody covers their face
[2:34:45] would you say
[2:34:46] it's so
[2:34:48] you can get the wrong woman
[2:34:53] you can wake up with the wrong wife
[2:34:56] with a covered face
[2:34:58] a lot of things can happen and so i find
[2:35:01] it very interesting that the pay is a
[2:35:03] picture of the face in hebrew your face
[2:35:05] represents you it represents your
[2:35:07] identity it's the picture of a mouth it
[2:35:10] means word speech expression and
[2:35:12] vocalization it reminds us that your
[2:35:15] words matter
[2:35:17] which when we brought this in 2020
[2:35:19] that's exactly what we said i in the
[2:35:22] decade of the eye gives insight but it's
[2:35:25] the pay the mouth that gives expression
[2:35:28] to insight so we not only have to see
[2:35:30] clearly
[2:35:31] we have to believe god to give us the
[2:35:33] grace to speak clearly the enemy doesn't
[2:35:35] want you to see what season you're in
[2:35:38] and he doesn't want you to be able to
[2:35:39] say anything about it
[2:35:41] right so he wants to blind you and he
[2:35:44] also wants to make you dumb
[2:35:46] no doubt about it there's no doubt in my
[2:35:48] mind that it's very prophetic that
[2:35:50] almost the entire population of the
[2:35:53] world has spent these last two years
[2:35:56] with their faces including their mouths
[2:35:59] covered by a mask
[2:36:01] wouldn't have meant the same in the
[2:36:03] decade of the eye
[2:36:05] we didn't cover our eyes
[2:36:06] it means something a little bit
[2:36:08] different when you're entering into a
[2:36:09] season where the emphasis is the mouth
[2:36:11] and now the mouth is covered and a
[2:36:13] people lose their identity
[2:36:15] they do
[2:36:16] they do they do i'm not criticizing a
[2:36:18] mass you should wear a mask when you
[2:36:20] feel like you need to i'm not in any way
[2:36:23] saying if you use the mask you're wrong
[2:36:25] what i'm saying is it symbolizes
[2:36:26] something prophetically
[2:36:28] the enemy is after your voice
[2:36:31] he doesn't want you speaking do you know
[2:36:34] why because he knows that within you is
[2:36:36] the power to speak your own deliverance
[2:36:40] because the holy ghost is there
[2:36:42] you might be waiting on someone else to
[2:36:44] deliver you you might be waiting on a
[2:36:46] preacher to pray for you but the truth
[2:36:49] is you have the power of the holy ghost
[2:36:51] within you and your deliverance is in
[2:36:53] your own mouth
[2:36:56] so wear a mask in public if that's what
[2:36:58] you feel like you should do but
[2:36:59] spiritually rip it off
[2:37:03] spiritually serve notice on the enemy i
[2:37:06] will not be silent
[2:37:09] i will speak the truth
[2:37:11] and i will speak my way out
[2:37:14] my the prophet taught us about the power
[2:37:17] and the significance of the spoken word
[2:37:20] we're nearly done
[2:37:22] but i'm getting it out there i'm going
[2:37:23] to be obedient i'm getting it out there
[2:37:25] what you do is up to you
[2:37:27] this represents our identity being
[2:37:29] concealed and our speech being muffled
[2:37:33] words are very powerful they affect both
[2:37:36] the hearer
[2:37:41] and
[2:37:42] the speaker
[2:37:44] did you know you were affected by the
[2:37:45] words you speak
[2:37:48] your whole body responds
[2:37:51] to the sound of your voice
[2:37:56] so the cancer doesn't belong to you
[2:38:00] the migraines don't belong to you
[2:38:03] the allergies are not yours
[2:38:07] come on
[2:38:10] this pain in my back is not mine
[2:38:15] it's trespassing
[2:38:17] it doesn't belong there so it's not my
[2:38:20] back pain
[2:38:22] it's not my cancer
[2:38:24] come on
[2:38:25] it's not my allergies it's not my sore
[2:38:29] toe
[2:38:30] it doesn't belong to me
[2:38:32] i am whole
[2:38:34] how are you whole because the word of
[2:38:36] god says i am whole with his stripes
[2:38:42] he healed me
[2:38:44] he sent his word and did what
[2:38:46] he healed me
[2:38:48] everything else is a lying vanity
[2:38:51] somebody said you're saying it's not
[2:38:52] real i think my pain oh no i believe
[2:38:55] it's real
[2:38:56] but it shouldn't be there
[2:38:59] and you have the about the power and the
[2:39:01] ability by faith
[2:39:03] to speak to that
[2:39:05] look folk
[2:39:06] you can't slip
[2:39:08] from the simple gospel
[2:39:10] of believing
[2:39:12] that you're made whole by the blood of
[2:39:14] the lamb
[2:39:15] you you cannot allow the enemy to talk
[2:39:18] you in to to everything and and own it
[2:39:21] as though you you've got to be broken
[2:39:22] down to because you're old
[2:39:28] well that means that i've got socks that
[2:39:31] are built better than i am
[2:39:35] because that means i've got pieces of
[2:39:37] furniture and things that man made that
[2:39:39] have lasted longer and held up longer
[2:39:42] and better than i have
[2:39:44] and i've got the best creator in all of
[2:39:46] eternity
[2:39:48] oh he made me so well
[2:39:51] i'm fearfully and wonderfully made by a
[2:39:54] loving god and i don't have to accept i
[2:39:56] do not have to accept it i see that some
[2:39:58] people won't accept it go ahead go ahead
[2:40:01] yours
[2:40:02] you can own it if you like
[2:40:05] but you've got a choice will you believe
[2:40:07] the word
[2:40:09] whose report will you believe
[2:40:12] so don't let the devil silence you
[2:40:15] let's look for we're we're not
[2:40:16] episcopalian
[2:40:19] we're not silent prayers
[2:40:26] we don't have to pray like some
[2:40:28] you know dead dry form of religion
[2:40:31] afraid that if we speak up in prayer you
[2:40:34] know we're going to be fanatic you you
[2:40:36] ought to pray if you have to the top of
[2:40:37] your lungs
[2:40:39] you ought to go through your home with
[2:40:40] your hands in the air like i have to do
[2:40:42] some time confessing with everything
[2:40:44] that you've got
[2:40:45] lord i take you at your word
[2:40:49] hallelujah like i said a moment ago i
[2:40:51] don't know
[2:40:52] but god you
[2:40:54] know
[2:40:56] no i'm not going to be quiet no i'm not
[2:40:59] going to be quiet
[2:41:03] you can't even hear
[2:41:05] uh when they take your order you have to
[2:41:07] listen so carefully in the natural to
[2:41:10] hear what they're saying i'm embarrassed
[2:41:12] because they see my gray beard
[2:41:15] and i know they think it's because i
[2:41:16] have a great beard that i can't hear
[2:41:19] but it's not it's because i can't hear
[2:41:21] through that
[2:41:24] nothing wrong with that if that's what
[2:41:26] i'm telling you i'm not against that
[2:41:28] in the natural
[2:41:30] but i'm against it in the spiritual
[2:41:34] somebody said they won't let me say
[2:41:35] anything in church you don't have to
[2:41:37] talk here
[2:41:39] to be able to talk
[2:41:42] but we've been offering every tuesday
[2:41:44] night
[2:41:46] testify to us of the goodness of god
[2:41:50] tell us what the lord has done
[2:41:52] come on and one by one we've gone
[2:41:55] through now all those that are going to
[2:41:57] probably and we're starting back on
[2:41:58] those that already have that's okay
[2:42:02] because some are determined ain't no
[2:42:04] rock
[2:42:08] gonna cry out in my place
[2:42:10] and some are determined where i am right
[2:42:12] now is not where i've always been
[2:42:15] and i may feel like i can't get a prayer
[2:42:17] above the ceiling now but there was a
[2:42:20] time
[2:42:21] that i prayed and it shook the heavens
[2:42:23] and god heard me and if i have to go all
[2:42:25] the way back to that like brother
[2:42:26] greeley has mentioned what the prophet
[2:42:28] said you can't say anything else you can
[2:42:30] tell them how your candle got lit
[2:42:32] if god hasn't done anything else for you
[2:42:35] since he saved you go all the way back
[2:42:38] and remember how he found you where you
[2:42:40] were and showed you grace and mercy and
[2:42:43] love and goodness and salvation and
[2:42:44] compassion anybody with me
[2:42:47] hallelujah
[2:42:50] your words are very powerful
[2:42:52] they're very powerful i'm going to skip
[2:42:54] that
[2:42:57] now
[2:43:00] there's so many interesting things that
[2:43:02] we can talk about maybe tuesday night
[2:43:05] but i have found that god can speak to
[2:43:07] us
[2:43:08] and as i said a moment ago the hebrew
[2:43:10] calendar he can speak to us in the
[2:43:12] gregorian calendar
[2:43:14] in 2008
[2:43:17] bob jones said to me personally i'd
[2:43:20] heard him say to others or mention it
[2:43:22] before in speaking
[2:43:24] but he said to me personally in 2008 he
[2:43:27] mentioned that he believed that there
[2:43:29] was a psalm
[2:43:32] that spoke prophetically for every year
[2:43:37] and i would just like to present that
[2:43:40] psalm to you that's not what i wanted to
[2:43:41] bring but i don't have time to talk
[2:43:43] about where we are in the 5782 but i
[2:43:46] will
[2:43:47] because
[2:43:49] two letters are coming together an 80
[2:43:52] a pay
[2:43:54] and a bet
[2:43:56] and it forms a very interesting message
[2:44:00] because the bet
[2:44:02] is the house
[2:44:04] and the pay
[2:44:06] is the mouth
[2:44:08] and as soon as i read it as soon as i
[2:44:12] read
[2:44:13] that the pay
[2:44:14] was the mouth and the bait was the house
[2:44:18] i heard this phrase what house
[2:44:22] will you build me
[2:44:25] it's a time and a season where god wants
[2:44:27] to talk to us
[2:44:29] he doesn't want to be muffled
[2:44:32] he doesn't want us to hear in a muffled
[2:44:33] manner
[2:44:34] he wants to be able to speak to us
[2:44:36] clearly and he wants to speak to us in
[2:44:38] the house
[2:44:40] because he's looking for a house
[2:44:42] he's looking for a place to dwell in and
[2:44:45] how many of you know that's not a
[2:44:46] building with four walls
[2:44:48] because that same word bet can also be
[2:44:50] used for tent or tabernacle or temporary
[2:44:53] dwelling place doesn't have to be a
[2:44:54] house so it's you it's you you're the
[2:44:56] tabernacle
[2:44:57] you're where he wants to reside and
[2:45:00] something beautiful many beautiful
[2:45:02] things
[2:45:03] start coming out because when you look
[2:45:05] at the letter pay
[2:45:07] there's a hidden bet there already
[2:45:10] if you'll just put that pay up again
[2:45:13] let's show them that you see where the
[2:45:15] where it's white in the center
[2:45:17] that is actually the letter bet it's
[2:45:19] there
[2:45:21] it's hidden in the pay
[2:45:23] it's the only year in the decade of 10
[2:45:25] years
[2:45:26] that the actual number of the year is
[2:45:29] reflected in the letter itself the pay
[2:45:32] both both attributes both meanings are
[2:45:36] expressed by looking at just one of the
[2:45:38] letters they both show up and there's a
[2:45:41] lot of interesting things that we can
[2:45:43] talk about and will i shared some of
[2:45:45] them with the class on wednesday but i
[2:45:48] want to just leave you with this because
[2:45:49] our time is done i want to leave you
[2:45:51] with the psalm for the year in 2020
[2:45:55] the hebrew year 5780 the psalm was 120
[2:45:58] read it
[2:46:00] read psalm 120 and see if that doesn't
[2:46:02] sound a little bit like your 2020.
[2:46:06] it's very very very
[2:46:11] i wanted to say uncanny but it's very
[2:46:14] very prophetic
[2:46:16] in 2021
[2:46:18] hebrew year 57 81 the psalm was 121.
[2:46:23] and now as we have entered into
[2:46:27] 5782
[2:46:28] leaving 2021 going into 2022 the psalm
[2:46:32] is psalm 122 and we're going to read it
[2:46:35] in closing would you stand
[2:46:37] musicians are coming
[2:46:39] we're going to read nine verses
[2:46:42] if you take the time
[2:46:44] to go back and look at psalm 120 if you
[2:46:47] take the time to go back it look at
[2:46:49] psalm 121 you're going to see things in
[2:46:52] those psalms that remind you of the year
[2:46:55] you had
[2:46:58] now i can go all the way back to 2008
[2:47:01] because the day that bob jones mentioned
[2:47:03] that to me i opened up my bible and i
[2:47:05] wrote down over that psalm i wrote the
[2:47:08] year 2008
[2:47:10] and i can go all the way back to 2008
[2:47:12] and read those psalms and i can find
[2:47:15] amazing messages or symbols
[2:47:18] in those psalms
[2:47:20] that spoke to me about the year that i
[2:47:22] was going to have
[2:47:24] and i can not only do it as an
[2:47:26] individual i can do it as a church body
[2:47:29] i can see things that happen to us and
[2:47:31] with us and in us
[2:47:32] that correlate with that psalm
[2:47:36] and i can also see it as a nation
[2:47:39] i can see that some of the verses in
[2:47:42] that psalm reflect what was going on in
[2:47:44] the nation at that time now they say
[2:47:46] hindsight is is 20 20. so looking back
[2:47:50] it's easier to see
[2:47:52] what was being spoken of than it is when
[2:47:54] we're looking forward
[2:47:56] but right now we're going to look
[2:47:57] forward
[2:47:58] and i want us to read it together and
[2:47:59] you should have it there psalm 122 all
[2:48:02] nine verses i was glad
[2:48:07] i was glad when they said unto me let us
[2:48:10] go into the house of the lord this is
[2:48:12] not a year
[2:48:13] to forsake the assembling of yourselves
[2:48:15] together as the manner of some is this
[2:48:18] is the year to get together with god's
[2:48:20] people
[2:48:22] i was glad when they said unto me let us
[2:48:24] go into the house of the lord our feet
[2:48:26] shall stand within thy gates
[2:48:29] jerusalem i'm going to jerusalem this
[2:48:31] year
[2:48:33] claiming it
[2:48:35] somebody said i just don't think you can
[2:48:37] do your life you do yourself what do you
[2:48:38] want to
[2:48:41] jerusalem is build it as a city
[2:48:44] that is compact together
[2:48:47] whether the tribes go up
[2:48:49] the tribes of the lord under the
[2:48:51] testimony of israel to give thanks unto
[2:48:54] the name of the lord
[2:48:55] for there are set thrones of judgment
[2:48:59] you better hear this
[2:49:01] the thrones of the house of david what
[2:49:05] is the hebrew letter for 5782 the pay
[2:49:08] and the bet
[2:49:09] and that is the house it represents the
[2:49:12] house
[2:49:14] the thrones of the house of david
[2:49:16] i read verse six and it tells me i need
[2:49:19] to be faithful in my prayers for
[2:49:22] jerusalem and for israel this year i
[2:49:25] need to be more faithful than i've ever
[2:49:27] been because something is on the horizon
[2:49:31] are you saying all that because of a yes
[2:49:34] that's how the scripture is supposed to
[2:49:36] work in our lives
[2:49:38] so yes for me i'm making a dedication
[2:49:41] i've already done it this week i'm
[2:49:43] making a dedication pray
[2:49:45] for the peace of jerusalem they shall
[2:49:48] prosper that love thee peace be within
[2:49:51] thy walls and prosperity within my
[2:49:54] palaces and i might also mention that
[2:49:57] the last message that the rabbi brought
[2:49:58] to us in this church was from that verse
[2:50:02] for my brethren and companion's sake i
[2:50:06] will now say peace
[2:50:09] be
[2:50:10] within thee
[2:50:11] lord we prophesy peace
[2:50:14] to the city of jerusalem to the nation
[2:50:16] of israel
[2:50:17] because of the house
[2:50:22] there it is again
[2:50:24] because of the house of the lord our god
[2:50:28] i
[2:50:29] will seek
[2:50:31] thy
[2:50:32] good
[2:50:35] now i believe that there are messages
[2:50:37] for us in the scripture
[2:50:39] and i believe after following these
[2:50:41] psalms
[2:50:43] i've at least usually read them to you
[2:50:45] in the year
[2:50:47] after following them since 2008
[2:50:50] i believe i can say that god has used
[2:50:53] the psalm of the year to speak to my
[2:50:55] life personally i've seen him address
[2:50:57] things in our church and i've seen him
[2:50:59] address things in our nation so i just
[2:51:01] encourage you if you have nothing else
[2:51:04] to go to war with in prayer you take
[2:51:06] psalm 122 with you
[2:51:08] and you say lord speak to me speak to me
[2:51:11] from this psalm show me direct my
[2:51:13] thoughts direct my prayers direct my
[2:51:16] footsteps because there's certainly
[2:51:19] something that you're wanting to say to
[2:51:21] me
[2:51:22] and i want to leave you with this verse
[2:51:25] psalm 66 verse 1 in the amplified thus
[2:51:28] saith jehovah
[2:51:31] the heavens are my throne
[2:51:33] and the earth
[2:51:35] is my footstool what is the house
[2:51:39] that ye
[2:51:40] will build unto me
[2:51:42] and what is the place
[2:51:45] of my rest
