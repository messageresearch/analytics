[0:13] God had an appointed time and in that
[0:18] moment he sent his son personally and
[0:21] individually to you and I'm telling you
[0:23] that's even more precious than the
[0:25] casting of the net for the whole world
[0:27] that means that if I would have been the
[0:29] only one that needed a savior he already
[0:32] would have sent him with an appointment
[0:34] to my life at just the right time
[0:36] whether it was in the Baptist
[0:39] sunday-school is a as a tiny little boy
[0:41] or whether it was you had already
[0:43] reached adulthood already done so many
[0:45] things to be ashamed of I don't know
[0:48] when the order of his coming to you was
[0:50] but remember you didn't find him he was
[0:55] not lost he found you and he didn't have
[0:59] to search very far because you are never
[1:02] so far that he didn't know where you
[1:04] were he had his GPS on you since the
[1:08] time you showed up over here he knew
[1:11] where you were who you were with what
[1:13] you were doing and he waited there was
[1:16] an appointed time and in that moment on
[1:19] the barstool in that moment in the inn
[1:22] in the frat house in that moment and
[1:24] whatever it was you were involved with
[1:26] running as hard as you could from God
[1:28] even in that moment you were a son
