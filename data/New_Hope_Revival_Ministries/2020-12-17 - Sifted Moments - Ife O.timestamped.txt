[0:00] it'll just be right down to a pure
[0:03] reduction of what jesus saw
[0:07] in us
[0:14] [Music]
[0:15] you're here in laodicea
[0:18] and every time you confess i don't know
[0:21] if i'll make it or not
[0:22] i don't know if i can get through this
[0:23] or not i don't see how i'm going to be
[0:25] able to survive this or not
[0:26] you're questioning the sovereign mind of
[0:31] god who sent you into this
[0:34] hour you are surely being tested and
[0:38] tried
[0:40] we are surely being sifted our hearts
[0:43] are
[0:44] being sifted before god
[0:47] we're in a great war in this hour
[0:51] but you're here because god saw
[0:54] that you would eventually yield
[1:00] your will would break
[1:04] you would make the right choice
[1:07] and again the right choice
[1:11] and again the right choice so that he
[1:14] could be glorified in your life
[1:16] he knew you would be broken he knew you
[1:19] would be squeezed
[1:22] he knew that you would suffer some
[1:24] things
[1:26] you would feel the sting of betrayal
[1:32] you would feel the grief of loss
[1:35] lost relationships
[1:40] of how things were
[1:43] and how we hoped they would always be
[1:47] but every part of that specially
[1:50] picked designed by a sovereign mind
[1:56] to bring you and i to that place
[2:00] where we could be roasted
[2:03] and reduced when we get down to the end
[2:07] of the end of this
[2:08] squeeze there'll be no actors among us
[2:12] there'll be no facades among us
[2:15] no false identities to protect our truth
[2:19] among us it'll just be right down
[2:23] to a pure reduction of what
[2:26] jesus saw in us
[2:30] before we came here and he assisted us
[2:36] by placing a seed
[2:40] in our life that's caused us
[2:44] to want more of him when everybody
[2:47] seemingly around us
[2:49] wants more of stuff
