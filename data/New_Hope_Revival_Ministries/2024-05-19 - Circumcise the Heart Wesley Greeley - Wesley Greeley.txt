for years and we have longed for and we have talked about it some more and we have we have harped on it and we have talked about it some more and yet there are things that seem almost within our grasp but not yet in our handhold and and we continue to press toward the promise of God because it is it's who we are we know who we are and we know that were the Royal Seed of Abraham and the Royal Seed of Abraham no matter what it looks like to everybody out else the promise that we have in the word that God when God looks at us because we're the Royal seed is they staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but were strong giving praise to God yes there are times that we have those issues where that we're we're not giving praise to God but I'm thankful for the blood of the Lamb that wipes all of that out and has a different record for me he staggered not at the promise of God so today we hold on to the promise and we look to the promise and we talk about the promise because the promise is ours now we have naysayers along the way that tell us uh yeah you've been talking about that for years and and and that that person talked about it and they're gone they're dead this person talked about it and they're gone they're dead yes I know that's that's all true but let's look at the the premise of the scripture today as to what all of this is about and how God works because our biggest problem is time God is God of Eternity and the fact is I am a creature of Eternity and if you are the Royal Seed of Abraham you are a product of Eternity you are an eternal being somewhere in you there's an eternal being but we are currently locked in the confines of time right and because we are locked in the confines of time we are constantly thinking I'll be dead before that happens and quite frankly it doesn't matter because the promise is still yes and amen God's promise is still yes and it's still amen and I'm still going to fight for it as long as I have breath in my body there may be times where you're down and I'm up and there may be times where I'm down and you're up and that's why the Bible tells us to pray for one another and encourage one another and lift one another up because everybody is fighting battles and sometimes we're stronger than at other times and we don't know exactly how to handle the situation that we're in but don't you worry I may be down but I'm getting up you may be down but you're getting up because you are the Royal Seed of Abraham and you're not going to stay in your current situation forever God has given you the grace and the courage and he gives you a word into season to bring you up and out of the condition that you may be in today does so we've read here in Psalm how that God gave this promise to Abraham and then uh this part that I didn't read it talks about all that in between stuff how that Joseph uh you know Abraham he had Isaac Isaac had Jacob Jacob had these 12 sons Joseph being one of them and the promise was there all along Joseph was taken to Egypt and when Joseph was taken to Egypt it was not a pleasant journey to get to Egypt because he went to his brothers his dad asked him to go and check on his brothers check on the sheep see how things are you check on them and they they when he got there they didn't like the calling in his life they didn't like it and so they said let's just get rid of him and so Joseph ended up in Egypt they thought they were rid of the dreamer but God sent him ahead of them to preserve life now I wonder sometimes how that those 11 those 10 brothers because really Benjamin was not uh old enough to to really know but the those other brothers when those years that elapsed where they didn't know what had H happened to Joseph how many years did they have to walk in guilt and condemnation and and downheartedness knowing that they lied to their father about what had happened and they had to carry the guilt of what they'd done and all of those years of carrying that and and they they they had to live out their lives they married wives and had children and then all of the sudden the famine comes and they go down to the land of Egypt to get corn because they find out that there's plenty down there and that is when they encounter their brother once again and Joseph says uh don't be angry with yourselves God did it to preserve life and we can get angry at ourselves as we look back over some of the Shipwreck of our own lives but God has a plan that he's working out we cannot continue to live our lives in the mistakes of yesterday we cannot continue to carry the guilt and condemnation of yesterday if we have truly repented and asked the Lord Jesus to put it under the blood his blood then we cannot continue to live in that condemnation you can't fix yesterday you can't fix the last hour it's pasted but what we can do is give praise to God that he chose us that he called our name and said come up a little bit higher I've got something I want to give to you I've got something I want to show to you I've got something I want to do for you so all of these things happen and Joseph and all of these things transpire and Jacob dies and and now they go on into bondage but God gave a promise to Abraham and that promise was that there was a land to possess a land to inherit and so as Abraham passed off of the scene and he passed this down to Isaac and Isaac passed off the scene it was passed down to Jacob and as Jacob passed off the scene it's p passed down to his children and now his children are in a place of bondage where that they are under an evil Taskmaster and they are wondering where is the promise where is it I I God I I believe my father Abraham right I believe that that that the promise that was given to Abraham when it was passed down the line the wording may be a little bit different but the promise is not distorted the promise is there there is a land that is promised to us to go and possess and all of the time while they're in Egypt they're wondering what in the world are we doing here and not possessing the promise and so the time comes that God sends them a deliverer oh yeah yes sir a man that was raised in the house of pharaoh that God recognized that he had too much of Egypt in him and he had to take him to the backside of a desert for 40 years to get Egypt out of [Music] him and he didn't bring him back to Egypt to get Egypt back in him he brought him to Egypt to bring more people out of Egypt oh where I could go with that statement when Moses came back to Egypt he came with a thus sayith the Lord Pharaoh let my people go now here are these people in bondage and Pharaoh receives thus sayith the Lord let my people go and he says I will not let them go and when he says I won't let them go I I I Marvel sometimes at the scripture because that we can get so mad at Pharaoh but the fact is that the Bible said that God hardened Pharaoh's heart God did it because God has a plan in in place because if they would have left on the first round right there would they would have went without some things that were necessary for them in the wilderness and so they had to go through this this succession of of of tragedy in Egypt the the plagues that were carried out to them and and so as these plagues are coming down on the children of Israel or the children of Egypt the the plagues coming down on them one by one and God is stripping Egypt Peace by Peace by peace now all the while Israel is still in bondage they're still under evil task Masters now as these plagues go on we can see how that these taskmasters uh they they are coming to pharaoh and they're saying why don't you just let them go things are getting a little difficult for us yeah but you know we're we're seeing a little bit of this you know this is touching Our Lives we're destroyed why don't you let them go and finally God uh causes pharaoh to let the people go right the hardness was pulled off of Pharaoh's heart long enough by the death of his firstborn for him to say get out take anything you want take your cattle take your children take all of you here have some gold have some silver take it with you just get out you have broke us completely so Moses leads them out when he leads them out of course they go across the Red Sea and they end up in the wilderness for 40 years I am going somewhere I'm not just telling you a Bible story I'm going somewhere they Circle the they go across the Red Sea and they circle around in the wilderness now I I we get frustrated sometimes because of the lapse in the time that it takes for us to receive a promise and you hear us preachers come and we repeat things that have happened in the past and I want you to know that it's no different than what happened in the scripture because God was continually reminding the children of Israel remember what I did to the Egyptians remember what I did at the Red Sea remember what I did when you were in the wilderness and you needed food remember what I did when you needed water remember how that you were tired of the Mana and you asked for quail and I gave you Quail remember remember remember so when us preachers come to the pulpit and we say remember when God did this it is not just a Pepto it is because God wants you to know that he has not forgotten what he's doing and that he has done it before and he'll do it again so they wander around in the wilderness now we we've got to take time to remember that when they got to the Wilderness that God chose through Moses to send out 12 Spies and to look at the land that's right God promised the land and I'm going to send out somebody from each tribe to go and search the land out and you are to come back and give us a report of what you find you go now what if every preacher that came and stood behind the pool Pulpit came with a report of evil as 10 of those spies did they're grasshoppers in our sight they're Giants you can't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't have speaking in tongues you can't have the gifts moving among you can't you can't have any of that it's too great for us it is it is beyond what we are capable of handling and so as these spies came back and they're given an evil report of a natural land that was promised to them then God said okay have it your way yeah and so they roam around in the wilderness for 40 Years sir yes sir now these 40 years God chose to do this to let a generation pass away all of the while that they're in the wilderness God was doing miraculous things miraculous things even for the ones that came back with an evil report they needed water too God gave them water they needed food too God gave them food they needed the pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud just like everybody else in the camp needed so that they didn't bake in the sun although there came a time where their life was ended and they had to be buried but God provided that for them in the wilderness and God has provided for the The Good the Bad and the Ugly the rain shall falls on the just and the unjust God does it just like he promised he would do it but there came the time when Moses was not permitted to cross over and the the the authority of leading the children of Israel was given over to Joshua God Appears to Joshua and says Moses my servant is dead today I will begin to magnify you in the eyes of the people so God begins to magnif IFI Joshua in the eyes of the people begins to show them that now that Moses is gone Joshua is in the leadership God has put his seal of approval upon Joshua to lead the people now and yes I am sure there were people that were there that were saying all along that ain't how Moses did it that isn't how Moses did it Moses Moes said Moses said Moses said but God said Moses my servant is dead the law is still in place but I've put you under a different leadership and I want you to follow this leadership as he leads you through uh to the promise that I have given you you so then God begins to do miraculous things under the leadership of of Joshua and we know that there were spies that were sent over into Jericho and these spies ended up in the house of Rahab and as Rahab there was s she she put a she put a uh a steadfastness she put a quickening in the spirit of these young men when she said our leaders are scared of you guys yeah our leaders are shaking in their boots every time that you guys are mentioned and and we want you to know that there is a fear here in Jericho of you people guys just kind of nodded their head nodded their head yes Lord yes Lord that's all I needed to hear that's that's that's all the report I need to take back to that's all I need to take back to Joshua I don't need to tell Joshua how many people are in that City I don't need to tell Joshua how big those walls are I don't need to tell no all I got to do is go back and say we were told that the leaders are shaking in their shoes every time we're mentioned and there was a woman in that City that believed us when we told her that you were fixing to take this city down and she protected us and she gave us a way of escape and she has let us down by a a scarlet cord and when we get to that City we're going to save her house we gave a promise to her so they take this report back they take this report back to Joshua and Joshua said okay that's good enough and then the Lord said to Joshua it's time for you to get this company over Jordan impossibility in front of them and as the impossibility in front of them they all see it but God already had a way for them to get across and that was once again for the sea to open up right now I just wonder how many of those people that crossed Jordan also crossed the Red Sea the Bible tells us that the men of War had to die out because they had brought back this evil report and I don't know if you watch things the same way that I watch things but I have been alive long enough to see Men of War leaving the scene because of an evil report that was given to the Bride of Jesus Christ and that evil report was you can't you can't you can't now we have been given instruction here at the first of the year that we were going to be mountain climbing and I believe that we've been mountain climbing all along but we were told that we needed to keep our balance in the scripture and as a minister that is my wholehearted desire is to keep my balance in the scripture and to stay in the middle of the road when it comes to this message of the hour that we have been given but at the same time I want to be faithful to declare that there is a land to possess for the Bride of Jesus Christ that we have never yet took a hold of I don't want to be one who airs on the side of caution I would rather put something out there that is a little maybe a little more than what because what I have noticed through the years is that the people will never go as far as the leader that's right so the leader has to take things a little bit farther maybe than they should be so that the people reach up a little bit higher than they would to take a hold of the promise of God and not to let it pass through their fingers and say I can't you can you're the Royal Seed of Abraham you know who you are why would you sit by in the wilderness and say the sun's going to bake my brains out and I'm going to sit right here and die right do it if you wish but I have no desire to sit in the wilderness and let the let the sun bake me and for me to say I can't I can't I can't I have been guilty of saying I can't I have been guilty of of of of wondering about the promises of God I have yet here I am in this J UA generation and have watched Men of War pass off the scene pass off the scene pass off the scene pass off this why is this it's because God has an army of believers who are going to take everything in the word that has been promised to her everything that the prophet gave to us to to to lay right in the scripture that will help us to better identify who we are and what is ours and what we're really here for we're not here just to pass time we're not here just to take up space we're not here just to fill a Pew sir no no no no we're not even here just to say I go to a certain certain church we are the Royal Seed of Abraham and Abraham's Royal seed has a promise and a promise of a land to possess and that is everything all all a dou l all that's all so now God once again opens up a sea opens up a body of water for them to cross over and as they cross over I don't know Joshua and Caleb I know for sure were the only two of that original group of Men of War that were permitted to cross over now obviously there probably were children there were women maybe that that had come through the Red Sea I don't really know how many there were but now they're again seeing the wonders of God as The Waters open up before them and they cross over this Jordan River yes now when they get across the Jordan River I Can Only Imagine imagine because now remember these guys have just come back to say I want to tell you Joshua that city of Jericho they're afraid of us they're all locked up they they've got the city barred uptight they they're just scared of us and there was an excitement that went through the camp as as this is being told as it starts getting out into the camp at Large these guys are our our our spies are back and they came back with a report that that whole city of Jericho is scared of us the leaders that they don't know what to do they're having Council meetings but that the that there's nobody going out of the city and nobody coming in the city they're just scared of us and as that excitement starts getting out to the people I can imagine there was just something stirring within them and God says okay it's time to cross the Jordan River so now the excitement as the priest with the Ark of the Covenant stepped down into the water and that water starts rolling back I can imagine the level of excitement in the people as they cross the Jordan River yes sir excitement and after they get across the Jordan River Joshua 5 says it came to pass when the king of the amor ites which were on the side of Jordan Westward and all the kings of the Canaanites were were which were by the Sea heard the Lord had dried up the Waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel until we were passed over that their hearts melted neither was their spirit in them anymore because of the children of Israel now the excitement is building more because now it's not just Jericho where the people are shaking in their shoes now we've got we got the kings of the amorites and we got the kings of the Canaanites and now that the excitement is building it's building it's building and God comes to Joshua and he says not yet buddy not yet we got to have a little stay here in the camp a little while and you need to pull out a sharp knife yeeha all of the excitement that has been building in these people because we are going to possess the land the Kings the king in the the leader inside of Jericho the king of the amorites the king of the Canaanites all of these guys are scared of us God just opened up the Jordan River and we all passed over and God says stop we got a problem we got a problem your excitement's building but we've got a problem here it's time to pull out the knife and cut off the excess flesh it's time to pull out the knife and do some circumcision God you have just taken a knife and put it in our balloon you have taken all of our excitement and you have just deflated us all the excitement that we had building now you tell us we've got to stop here and have a delay again to have circumcision now let's just stop here on circumcision because circumcision was something that God instituted as a covenant for Abraham when in Genesis chapter 17 when God appeared to Abram as elai he appeared to him and he said I am almighty God and he's letting Abraham know that he has come to the end of himself he has an ishmail that he has to look at but he yet doesn't have a promised son through Sarah and God appeared to him and says I am almighty God and I am going to change your name I'm going to breathe the breath of life into you preached it here before if you look at their names in Hebrew both of their names were added with the same Hebrew character ay the Breath of God both of them have the same breath breathed into them but God said Abraham I am going to give you a promise of a land that you don't yet see but I'm going to give you a promise but this Pro I'm going to give you a covenant of the promise and that Covenant is circumcision and so right then the Bible says the selfsame day that God appeared to Abraham and changed his name then gave him the Covenant of circumcision the selfsame day Abraham was circumcised ishmail was circumcised and all of the males in Abraham's house were circumcised and God gave him a promise promise that Abraham never fully saw so Abraham has eventually has Isaac Sarah dies Abraham goes on and has another wife coutura has six Sons by her but the Bible said that Abraham separated all of them from the promised seed ishmail the sons of the concubine they were all separated from Abraham and Isaac they were separated from him because the promise was to Isaac it wasn't to the outside it was to Isaac and God separated them so if you ever feel separated know that you are Abraham's Royal seed and that's exactly what God does is that he separates you because he has a possession for you to possess and he doesn't want ishmael's and and six Sons of a Cura mocking you every time you talk about your promise exactly right he wants you to fellowship with like-minded believers who are pressing toward the promise that God gave to you so this Pro this Covenant of circumcision now when when uh Abraham goes off the scene and Isaac and then Jacob and the TW sons of Jacob apparently this continued through that lineage and and even into the time while that the they were in captivity in Egypt because when they came out of Egypt the men of War were circumcised the Bible tells us that okay so now it's passed down through all that lineage these men are they they come out of Egypt cross the Red Sea Moses goes up on the mountain comes down and he is given the law now the Bible tells us in Leviticus that Moses gave them the word of the Lord that they were to circumcise the male child on the eighth day right but when we read Joshua chap 5 the scripture tells us that somewhere somebody forgot or somebody rebelled doesn't specifically say but as I was as I was pondering the scripture last night I thought how how if a group of people could keep a a a covenant with the Lord through Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the sons of Jacob in in in Egypt even to the point they were circumcised and and no doubt Moses was was circumcised on the eighth day even before he ever got to Pharaoh's Palace he was circumcised but these they just kept this Covenant of circumcision and when they came out of Egypt and they cross the Red Sea circumcision was being done but when they got to the Wilderness and Moses comes back with the law God reiterates to them through the law that circumcision was a part of the Covenant that he wanted them to keep but yet when Joshua we read here in the Book of Joshua that somebody let go of something in the wilderness there was a gener ation of men and women as the men of War died out yes there was still a generation that wasn't doing what they were supposed to be doing so much to the point that when God again took them over a body of water and there was an excitement that was building in them that they were fixing to go get the land that God promised them and Joshua says oh wait a minute I've got a word from the Lord that we've got to stop right here and that we've got to do some circumcision there's some extra flesh that doesn't need to be carried into battle there's some extra stuff that's hanging on to somebody that doesn't need to be carried this is God's covenant there are people that think it's cruel and unusual punishment but it's God's covenant there are people who do not understand the Covenant that God has with the bride in the end time that you will take on every word and that you'll cut off all the excess flesh so brother brenham's day we kept hearing a phrase over and over over the days of Miracles are passed that was the phrase that was used in his day God used him for a message of Divine Healing to the world that's right and that phrase that was used in his day was that the days of Miracles are passed and he had to combat that everywhere that he went because there were Men of War there were Men of War that rather than receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and recognizing that everything in the book belonged to them they decided that they would better be able to serve the people with an intellectual knowledge of the scripture they could break it down and give it in better bite-sized pieces to the people until that they had completely taken the blessing of divine Miracles away from the people divine healing right and we see this happen over and over and over again and we were given a message to us that all that God had ever said about Abraham's seed was to the elect right and in brother brandom's time momentum built momentum built people were seeing again the Miracles right that God had for people's bodies that they could be healed divinely healed and God never took it away he didn't God didn't say here it is and then say okay I'm done with it take it back he's a god of addition we need to do some subtraction but he is the god God of addition right and so as with Joshua Joshua is now looking at the people and he's saying we have carried some things with us across the Jordan that should have been left on the other side but God wanted to do some things for us and now Moses is dead God put this commission upon me Joshua to lead you you to possess what was yours now we've got to remember some things here because there were some people on the other side of Jordan where they had camped the night before that didn't want to go fight we've already got our possession we we've we've got what belongs to us you know we're we're fine you you go across if you want to you you you go be one of them churches that has crying screaming shouting acts 238 youngans crying and crying slobber and snotting you you do that if you want to but we're satisfied over here know I'm I'm just not all that emotional and you know if this is all the higher I can get my hand you you you just got to deal with it you got rotator cuff problems God's still Divine healer we can get it up higher than that you know we can get both of them up we can we can get here where the sign of surrender is we can we can let the Lord know we're just raising the white right White Flag I've had all of me that I can stand my way ain't working my intellectualism just ain't getting me where I need to be my intellectualism ain't getting me across the Jordan River my intellectualism ain't getting me to help me to take care of Jericho my intellectualism ain't giving me the grace I need to to to fight pornography my intellectualism ain't giving me what I need to be able to put down the thoughts that caus me to be suicidal I just rais my hands in a surrender Lord that I've got to have a circumcision some body let it fail somewhere but I've got to have a circumcision nobody wants the bloody mess nobody wants it but after a while the bloody mess is necessary because we just aren't Conquering the way we should be not enough Victory keeping everything that we think belongs to us people don't like it when we talk about as was done here on Tuesday night the the Christmas tree and the necklaces and and all of these things and and I'm not here to even talk about them today but I I go back to leody deia yeah people's rights the age of people's rights and so when God comes and he says to us and he says why don't you just let that thing go you don't need it right and our attitude of response toward him and when we say but it's my right yeah this person had it why can't I justify it ourselves and it's our right to keep it that is the age of leod DEA right well what about you preacher do you have some things that you don't oh me me and the Lord talk about some things yes but I'm finding myself in a place where that I realize that is the spirit of Leo deia and I don't want any of Leo deia to be on me I don't don't even want the smell of lead DEA on me because that that thing keeps creeping back in and and and and we we seen that when when Moses was alive and the Word was being laid down that the people stayed in Step because Moses was there to say uh-uh that's not according to the word right see people have a problem differentiating the gift and the man because when a man stands behind this sacred desk and the anointing comes there is a message that goes forth that's right but when the man steps out of the pulpit and the anointing leaves him he has to go home just like any other man in this church and he has to be the head of his house just like any other man in this church or anywhere else he's got to be the man of his house and unfortunately the anointing is not the same and so then we use it as excuse because the preacher's household does it wait a minute wait a minute the word is the word that's it changes not and the preacher has to live with his wife and with his children just the same way as any other man that has a wife and children and he has to choose his battles and so that's why we have quotes that says there was Christmas tree for Joseph girl cutter bangs picture with the pearls around the neck all of these things because the it's the spirit of leoda it's my right I can have it because it's my right we may have even crossed over Jordan but now Joshua was saying wait a minute folks you may be excited to go take Jericho but my papa says we've got to have a stay right here and there has to be a circumcision before we can move forward and so we wonder sometimes why that the word comes to cut us and it cuts off that excess flesh and there listen I'm with you I feel like I've been in this thing long enough that can it be done already is there do I say do I am I so stubborn that that that that that I I the knife still has to be brought out but the best thing that I can do is to say yes Lord I you've revealed it I you've revealed that you want to cut it off my stubbornness my anger my unforgiveness my bitterness you want to cut all of that stuff out of me and and you don't want me to go into a war with my bitterness because I will react to things in a wrong way and I will find myself in Friendly Fire because I allowed un un undone stuff undone stuff that I carried with me into a battle and I find myself bloody and I find my brother bloody because that I had stuff in me that I didn't allow the Holy Spirit to cut out and then we get in a battle together and something doesn't go we don't have just exactly the same idea about how we're going to overcome the conflict and then rather than putting our focus on the enemy we started each other because that we have not let the excess flesh be cut off the possession is still there to get the land is still in front of us Jericho is still there and they're still shaking in their shoes yes sir we're out here having a bloody party with a sharp knife in a very private part right that doesn't feel good but the land is still there to possess Jericho is still straightly shut up they're still the land that God is given to us but God is currently cutting things out of us we've seen victories we have we have seen victories you let me show you how this works they went and took Jericho nobody lost life they went to another B another battle or two nobody lost life but then there came the battle at Ai and there was somebody that the heart hadn't been circumcised the foreskin may have been but the heart had not been and there was greed in his heart see God has to deal with us about greed too because we find oursel wanting this and wanting that and there's not enough money for this and there's not enough money for that there's not enough money for first Sunday offering but I want this and I want that and so I'm going to borrow from this to pay this and I'm going to use this to do this and we find oursel with a greedy heart I'm not here to preach to you about money even but it's an issue of the heart greed is an issue of the heart because God can allow us to be people of wealth without a greedy heart because his way of doing things is the more you give the more he gives the more you hold on to it the more he holds on to it remember the New Testament concept is if you give your life you can keep it but if you keep your life you lose it I just listened to this week early in the week on the teaching of Moses where brother Brandon was preaching on a Mother's Day preaching to the children not the mothers preaching to the children but it was a Mother's Day and he's talking about that scripture with the life of Moses how that jocked and amram how that amram would go up and he would find a place in prayer every night because he kept he hearing this bad news kept hearing this bad news about what was happening how they were killing the children and then all of a sudden jocked amram comes and says I have a promise of a son and the the whole story going through it and and brother brandom is telling these children the concept of giving away giving and that it will come back to you rather than with our stingy or our greedy we hold on to things and then we end up losing more in the end that's the way God works that's his concept so if we can allow the Holy Spirit to cut off the excess flesh there is a land to possess for us again we're see we we've seen Parcels of it God just doesn't hold it all for the end he gives you things along the way to keep you encouraged and it's the grace of God to us he keeps us encouraged but this this process of circumcision happens over and over again again and it seems like we're building momentum like a we're crossing the Jordan River God had opened it up and they're thinking about all the C the people shut up inside the city and there's momentum building and all of a sudden circumcision time and it just doesn't feel good then God lets them go and possess yeah and then all of the sudden there's an AI because somebody in the camp has got some issues and then those issues we see that God had to bring them back to the camp and say we've got to do some soul search in here because something got in somewhere help me out here his name is slipping my mind achen thank you Ain no doubt achen was one of them right here in Joshua chapter 5 that was circumcised but there needed to be another circumcision of the heart because there was something inside of him that's why intellectual gospel will not work doing all the right things will not work after a while you get tired of it and you'll be like some of these that have that have said there's no truth there I don't know what you people are talking about I don't know why you keep doing this same stuff it's just religion and you keep on it's just a set of rules yes for you that's exactly what it was was a set of rules for aen that he followed the rules followed the rules I'm going to be circumcised with all the men of War I'm I he was a man of war because he was in the battle but some people lost some lives so they had to come back and say what's going on here we we've got to do some some soul searching we got to do some checking so they come back to the camp and one by one God starts dealing God starts dealing God starts dealing see friends not every message is for you as an individual you're not always guilty so you don't have to carry guilt well every time something like this is preached you don't have to carry guilt every time if you got some things in you that the Lord needs to deal with all you got to do is say Lord I'm yours I'm sorry uh you revealed it and I want rid of it give me the grace you don't have to leave the house depressed you don't have to leave with condemnation because there is thou therefore no condemnation to those that walk in Christ Jesus who walk after the spirit and not after the flesh walking after the spirit God still deals with stuff inside of us but we don't have to carry condemnation and leave out of here now now if you don't deal with it while you're here of course you may carry and go out of here feeling guilty and condemned and whatever and God may have to put a little more pressure on you for you to say yes has anybody ever been there where God where where God started dealing with you and when the service was over you you hadn't been willing yet to let it go and so you carried it for another day or a week or two weeks or a month or a year you just kept on carrying and you lived with that condemnation and guilt and and and and yeah but not every message do you have to go out of the house guilty or condemned or feeling like it was slung at you no no no no there are things that are behind us friends there are things that some of us have got behind us we have conquered and see not everybody is on the same plane there are some that go before there are some that are are pioneers that have paved the way there are some forerunners that have taken the brunt of the battle there are some folks that have gone before us who have in prayer beat down the devil have beat him back so that it wasn't so hard for you amen so that you could say yes Lord true so as we bring this to a close today we just want to tell you you don't have to carry everything you when when when there is when God stops the camp and there's an issue and God says it's time to circumcise the heart then all you got to do is say search me Lord and try me one more time that's right okay I don't I don't see anything in this search that applies to me right but that didn't mean there wasn't an Ain that the Lots didn't eventually get to all right aen what have you done what are you carrying we lost some men in a battle and God said we've got to stop right here and find out where the sins at we we've got to stop it we can't even go forward conquering what God has already given us potentially we got to stop we got just like when they got across the Jordan God said stop let's do some circum circumcision they come out of this battle having lost some men they got to stop again from from conquering what God had already give them they got to stop because somebody's greedy and they take some time Lots cast down till finally it gets to aen all right Ain what what's going on and he revealed that he had hidden some of the some of The Spoils of War in his tent that didn't belong to him because God said destroy it you don't need to carry any of this canaanitish stuff into your house right you don't need to keep any of it it's not yours it's not going to help you attain the promise just let it be leave it leave it in Egypt leave behind don't take it with you musicians I'm going to tell you come on this time so the Covenant that God gave to Abraham right Abraham never saw it he never saw the Fulfillment of the land God said I'm going to give you a son God did give him a son Isaac that was the promise but Abraham never saw the Fulfillment of the land of promise that was given to him and it passed down from generation to generation there there came a time that the this Covenant was carried on and it was expressed through the Covenant of circumcision that was how that you were a part of the Covenant you kept this Covenant that God gave to Abraham so now today here we all are are all of these years later this Covenant of circumcision that was given to Abraham that that was a that was a physical Covenant that was given to him we have been given a covenant of circumcision in the spirit that God it's something that has passed down see the Covenant of circumcision when Abraham did it it was imputed unto him for righteousness and when you allow the Holy Spirit to come in your life and to cut away all of the excess flesh all of the things in in your flesh all of the things in your body in your soul in your emotions your mind and your will you allow the Holy Spirit to cut all of that out of you all you are doing is displaying that you are a part of the Covenant of Abraham that you are Abraham's Royal seed and the only thing I want to point out is that sometimes God stops the group and he pulls out the sharp knife of the word because friends we've seen enough loss of life we've seen enough people fall by the wayside we he we have seen enough people who have given up because they tried to do it through an intellectual gospel and they finally got to a point in their life where they said what's the use why should I keep all of the rules when there are people around me that look like they're living happy go-lucky lives and they live any way that they want to live and they do anything that they want to do and they drink all the drinks that they want to through the week and they they they get high on marijuana and whatever else they decide they want to do and and and here I am trying to keep the rules and and I don't feel like that I'm any better off than they are that is an intellectual gospel exactly reasoning a product of the Mind the will and the emotion and as a person of Covenant it is necessary for me to look beyond the mind the will and the emotion I may see people that look happier than I am to day what's happiness got to do with it for all I know they're jacked up on some kind of a drug that makes them happier than they ought to be little veiled thing there and it causes them for a moment they have to get an outside source that is not a spiritual Source it's a physical source to make them happy for a moment and you know what it does it takes them broke and you know what else it does it makes a beautiful woman broken down horrible looking without teeth and sunken in skin and blotches all over her skin because she has sought an outside source to try to keep her happy because there was not a circumcision of the Mind the will and the emotion and they look for a fleshly way to keep them happy for a moment friends the Holy Ghost is calling to us on a daily basis and once again today to let him cir circumcise us in our heart and ears once again that we would not be stiff necked like the children of Israel and that we would not try to satisfy our lives with an intellectual gospel and then become fed up with it and go back to the ways of Egypt but to call to hear the call of the spirit to say Moses my servant is dead and I'm leading you into a land of promise that was promised way before Moses the promise was way before Moses way I just give you some little interesting thing here before Benjamin comes to lead us in worship concerning possessing the land we have the Book of Genesis we have a bunch of History then Exodus which is the leading of the children of Israel out and and all the doings there then we have the Book of Leviticus where the law is given and we have numbers and we see a bunch of happenings there with balum and and and all of that and then you get to the the fifth book of Moses Deuteronomy and 50 times 50 verses 50 verses in the book of Deuteronomy that used the word possess the land possess the inheritance I've given you possess the children the the fathers have forsaken it but I've given it to the children to go possess 50 verses in Deuteronomy and mo no doubt this is Moses giving the children of Israel knowing that that he smokee The Rock twice when God told him to speak to the Rock and now he's given encouragement to a future generation and he's wanting them to know that there is something there for them to grab a hold of don't let I'm giving it to you 50 times I'm telling you 50 times I don't want you to forget it when you're down and out when you feel like that you're not seeing when God is you in the wilderness and he's telling the sharp he's telling Joshua to get the sharp knife out I just want you to remember go possess the land go it's yours go possess it were children behind you that died in the wilderness that the promise was given to them but they chose to satisfy the Deeds of the Flesh and they chose to believe an evil report but I'm bringing the promise forward and that's where we're at here in 2024 the promise continues to be brought forward there were those that fell in the wilderness there were those that chose an intellectual gospel there are those that are choosing Le oysa but as for me in my house stand together with us today as for me in my house when the sharp knife is brought out we just lift our hands and say Yes Lord I am a part of the Joshua generation that's going in and when there's a when there's an aching in the camp I'm just going to throw up my hands and say search me Lord if I if I've got anything to hide turn the light on brighter so I can see what it is let us pray father as we stand here now I believe that this is a group of people that just wants everything that you have promised to us in the end time times get tough we have seasons where that we want to satisfy the Flesh and you come along with the knife and we respond in a way that says yes Lord God whatever you can take from this message today to the people and use it for your glory I now speak over this congregation and say seal it in Lord let it reverberate in us that you can do in us as a body of Believers here at New Hope Revival ministries to launch us forth to go and take all of the promise that you have spoken to us in time past in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen let's worship together oh Jesus I saw the Lord SE

from us we're not going to let any aen take it away from us we're not going to let anybody from another generation say it's not possible we're not going to let that reverberate in our ears but we're
