TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hi I'm brother Shelly from New Hope revival ministries and I'm rich when it comes to friends I am so blessed to have friends from all over the world some who have been with me through the years faithful tried and true and on occasion I'm still able to make a new friend or two as we go along life's journey I was recently sitting down talking to one of my friends wrist dunker who God has been blessing and speaking to and dealing with for a long time now especially over the past few months we were thinking about the early church and how it must have been disappointing to see the older members dying going by the way of the grave when they were living with such an anticipation expectation that Jesus was coming back any day than I asked him we want to get a little that on video and share it with our other friends I want you to listen I believe it's important that we live with an expectation of the coming of the Lord I want you to pay close attention to the part where Russia shares if we knew the date just say we could know the date the Bible says no man knoweth the day or the hour but if we knew the date how would we live between now and then I think it's a good question I pray you'll be blessed by what Russia shares god bless you [Music] hi this is Russ dunker from Carver Minnesota and I just like to share a little bit of a story over the last couple years that I've had and how I've come to know some of the family here had new hope and pastor Shelly and his team I'd like to start out with actually talking a little bit about Paul Keith Davis was kind of the beginning of some of the journey and 2015 I was watching some of his webinars a friend had sent me a link to his voice of the bride webinars so I was watching those in 2015 and I saw a theme in some of those webinars and palki Davis would reference a man named William Branham quite often and so finally I thought why is he fascinated with this man I had never heard of him before and so I decided to get on some websites and find out who William Branham was after that things started really opening up in the Bible and really was enjoying learning about the message and learning about William Brannon and some of the things of the kingdom that I wasn't familiar with I've been walking with the Lord for 24 years but I had never heard of the healing movement I'd heard the name Billy Graham and Oral Roberts but that really was about as much as I'd ever heard never had really studied end times or the Book of Revelations but it just seemed to open up when I started listening to some of the things of the message and then coming forward in late 2016 in the same way I noticed that on these webinars that Paul Keith Davis was also talking about pastor Stephen Shelly and after a few times of that coming up I decided to go on to YouTube and see who pastor Shelley was and some of the first things I found on YouTube was Paul Keith Davis and pastor Shelly sitting down and talking about the ministry of william brennan talking a little bit about perry green from tucson and so decided in in around probably late fall of 2016 to send out a an invitation to see if we could get together and meet in the in the time we had gotten a a card because we had watched the the fall camp meeting here and had signed up for the streaming and watched that and was really encouraged by it so we received a card I believe it was a Hanukkah card from the Shelly family and in turn we sent our Christmas card down to New Hope here in greetings as well so we were finally able to connect later on in 2017 but about that time something significant had had happened to me personally I was in my living room talking to a friend of mine named will and this light came through the ceiling and I'm not prone to these types of experiences and I followed the light and it came in to me and we had been talking together about the body of Christ whenever we were on the phone people were constantly saying they were busy they were busy how have you been brother Habib in sister busy busy and we were having that conversation and when that light came through and came in I just simply said to my friend on the phone hold on and I said Lord what is that and he said to me says you've got it all wrong and I said what do I have wrong and he says time and he says you look at time as a curse but time is really a blessing and I said well what do you mean by that and he said well your mindset is that you feel that you will have time to get to know me and in turn but it's on this side that you get to know me so rather than looking at time as a curse waiting to get to eternity you need to really be looking at time as a blessing and that's what that voice said to me and it wasn't long after that I was listening on the VOD and pastor Shelley said in a message in December of 2016 virtually the same thing in in talking in one of his Sunday morning messages as what that light had said to me so that was kind of a double witness or a confirmation to me that the Lord really wanted me to start looking at time and getting really the message was to know him rather than waiting for eternity to get to know him and so then we were able to connect and we were able to I was able to fly down several times throughout this year and connect through text and of course watching the VOD and really kind of getting up to speed studying the table with William Brannon studying some other message pastors were primarily listening to the the feeds coming out of New Hope and livestreaming when we had the availability then about six weeks ago had another experience this one was a little different I was simply talking to a friend of mine on the phone who was struggling with issues of time and real things coming at them from all different directions and all of a sudden I just heard out of my own mouth I said in an interactive date there was a date that just came randomly but what I said to him is what if on August 22nd 2022 the Lord told us that that that's going to be his return to this earth say that he came to us as John saw the Lord Jesus where he fell down as a dead man in the Book of Revelations with his hair white as wool and a his feet his burnished bronze and stuff and what if he came and he delivered a message with a date and we knew a specific date of when the Lord was returning and I said to this friend of mine what would you do and he simply made this statement he said that would change everything he said everything I would do from now until then would be focused on the coming of the Lord because it would just enhance the return of the Lord we all know it by the word and but we never really think about the actual return at least he and I were having that discussion and so then coming forward here a week ago I was simply getting out of the shower meditating on the Lord and I heard the word date and I thought date I wonder what the Lord was talking about but I knew he was connecting it back to that experience six weeks earlier so I sat my family down in the living room and proceeded to talk to them again about this revelation of the date only this time when I when I spoke it I really felt the heat of the Lord on it wanting me to really focus not on a date meaning trying to set the time of his return but trying to get my mind set to work on a way of where I was expecting his return and as I meditated on these things I started thinking about first and second Thessalonians and I'll come back to the date but I want to I want to read something in Thessalonians to you it says here in in 1st Thessalonians 4 it's talking about the coming of the Lord and it says for this we say to you by the word of the Lord that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will not precede those who have fallen asleep for the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of an archangel and with the trumpet of God and the dead in Christ will rise first then note then we who are alive and Maine will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall and we shall always be with the Lord and so as I was meditating on this Scripture I flipped over to second to first Corinthians 5 23 and I look at this verse now may the God of peace himself sanctify you entirely and may your spirit soul and body be preserved complete without blame at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and what struck me is is the it says the coming of the Lord and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ in these two verses and so I went back and I wanted to see when these were written and I realized that first Thessalonians was according to scholars really the first letter that Paul ever wrote as an apostle and as I was reviewing this it dawned on me by the Holy Spirit that this scripture speaks of a sanctification that the Lord does but it says spirit soul and body the tripart man but then I said to myself everybody's body has gone to the grave there has not been a preserved or complete body yet other than the Lord Jesus Christ and so what the Lord was showing me at least my revelation was this that this scripture had yet to be fulfilled that this scripture was pertaining to first Thessalonians for those who are live are going to be alive and remain will have their spirit their soul and now their body preserved because everybody else is in the grave and as I was meditating on these scriptures the Lord just kind of spoke to me and said really wasn't that part of William branham's message in Malachi 4:6 and I'm just going to reference that scripture just so that we're clear about it but part of his ministry was the children and the hearts of the children to the father's to bring the hearts of the children back to what is known as the Apostolic fathers well here's one of our Apostolic fathers the Apostle Paul and he's writing his first Thessalonians first letter to the Thessalonians and really what is he doing is he's bringing comfort to them because they're expecting the return of the Lord already some 22 years later this is presumably written around 52 ad so the Lord Jesus has departed from the earth and 80 30 and 22 years later it appears people are starting to die and they're wondering well what's happening I'm dying and the Lord hasn't returned yet and I and I love how the father uses the Apostle Paul to write a letter that tells them that in no way will those who are alive and remain precede up into the clouds with the Lord before those who are dead in Christ so the dead in Christ will go to the grave but those that alive and remain will go up in the clouds but it's the dead in Christ will rise first and I thought what a comfort to the church but then my mind started thinking back to william branham was being that messenger and how he spoke to the Pentecostals but then how he also spoke kind of into the to the millennial reign and kind of that cross over and how he was bringing that message forward from Malachi and that message part of that message is the return of the children's hearts to the Apostolic fathers and and what is that is living with that date in mind that date of the return of the Lord Jesus these people here were giving up everything for the gospel they weren't thinking about retirement they weren't thinking about being in fact when they they went and got beat for the gospel they counted that as an award being being used and suffering as a reward to be close to the Lord everything were looking at was the coming kingdom not this earth life and to me that's part of what the message and and William Branham has brought back to me was kind of this looking again at eternity and looking at the Book of Revelations and looking at the kingdom of God verses at this earth life and just being saved and blessed and prosperous which was really kind of the message that I I taught and learned from an early Christian age talking about being saved and so what has really happened for me yesterday meeting with pastor Shelley me in his office is we were talking about some of these scriptures and some of these times and some of these these dates and he mentioned he said well the Lord has really had me on the mind and the soul of the mind will and the emotions and and really has had me focused and not allowed me to get off of there and as soon as he said that I felt the Spirit of the Lord just give me this incredible revelation and it is really was tied into the sanctification that is mentioned here in 1st Thessalonians I'm going to get back to this year 523 and what that says again just for reference now may the God of peace himself so God Himself is going to sanctify us entirely and it says may your whole spirit your whole soul in your whole body and I was looking at the body the return of the body on this on this earth this glorified body but really the soul the mind will and emotions is where I need to grow in and realizing when Pastor Shelley said that yesterday it really just flooded me with light to realize it's really that that garment that's been stained is really in the soul that I've been born-again and and washed in the blood of Jesus in the spirit and my body according to this will be preserved complete by the Lord but it the soul that has been my challenge my mind will and emotion but then I was a little depressed when I first saw this because I thought well how do we do this but then I looked at verse 24 and it's as faithful is he who calls you and he also will bring it to pass so what I found after reading that is if I will just position myself in front of the word and of course in the teaching that the Lord has the fivefold ministry and positioned myself in front of this word in in along with the Lord in this which is the word that he is faithful and he's the one who calls me to bring it to pass and so that brought great comfort to me but what I wanted to share today was just that that that date I kind of used this my son is a swimmer and he has been swimming now for five years and he swims six days a week he has tens of thousands of minutes that he has spent before he goes to a swim tournament when he gets to a swim turn tournament excuse me he may only swim ten minutes and he may win a gold medal and that's the date the date of the gold medal and the date of the tournament but really it was those previous six years and tens of thousands of minutes and hours that brought him to that gold medal to that date so I'm not so much looking to try to discern the actual date the August 22nd 2022 was just a date that came out of my mind at that time just as an example but really what it did is it made me take a look and say with that date that I want to be everything I can in the Lord I want to be sanctified spirit soul and body I want to agree with this scripture because I do not see that has been complete yet that has to be completed for those who are alive and remain and so I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me today and I hope this brings encouragement to you and I just want to say God bless you there is a spot at the Lord's chest it's only yours nobody can nudge you out of your place at the trough but you're the only one that can make up your mind to take your place and I hear people so many times saying things like I don't have the time I didn't have time I don't have time I want you to know that at the end of the day it's all you have it's all you do have it's all we have we're waiting on eternity to get close to you we may never go all the way it's in this realm that God has offered us this invitation to lay on his word and let it speak to our hearts [Music]
