[0:13] it's very important in this hour no
[0:17] matter what your goals are no matter
[0:19] what your desires are no matter what
[0:22] your future plans are it is very
[0:24] important in this moment that you first
[0:27] seek the kingdom of God because in that
[0:31] kingdom there is a government that is
[0:34] higher than any form of government that
[0:37] we have come to understand it's even
[0:40] higher than a theocracy because we're
[0:44] thinking about there being a king on the
[0:46] throne but as the message begins to come
[0:49] and unfold and reveal Jesus Christ to us
[0:52] we begin to see that you and I have also
[0:55] a very special calling amen
[0:59] we also have a very special position and
[1:02] a special place to him that overcometh
[1:04] will I grant to him that he would sit
[1:10] with me in my throne if this is really
[1:14] right and I am really born for this if I
[1:18] am really elected and predestinated to
[1:21] this then then I must be I must be I
[1:25] have no choice yet but to be everything
[1:29] that God has called me to be and I've
[1:32] got to figure out any hindrance in my
[1:35] life I've got to figure out whatever it
[1:37] is that's causing me fatigue that's
[1:40] causing me not to be able to press the
[1:42] battle as I have pressed it in the past
[1:45] I got to get my eyes on the goal and the
[1:47] goal it's not heaven the goal its Christ
[1:50] formed in you it is Christ in you the
[1:54] hope of glory that is the goal and
[1:58] therefore we reach the totality of the
[2:01] promise before we go because this is not
[2:05] Christ in you the hope of glory after
[2:09] the rapture
[2:11] in the Millennial Kingdom this is Christ
[2:14] in you the hope of glory we have the
[2:19] mind of Christ we have the mind of
[2:22] Christ this is Christ in you the hope of
[2:26] glory now
