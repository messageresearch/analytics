[41:57] [Applause]
[41:58] oh the Lord is
[42:01] moving by his Spirit he is moving and we
[42:06] give him room to move how he wants to
[42:09] and as long as he wants to we're just
[42:13] just enveloped in his
[42:15] presence and while he's close we take
[42:18] our needs to him do you have needs over
[42:21] the building by the lifting of the hand
[42:23] they're all over the building tonight
[42:25] out across the street the Lord sees the
[42:28] needs that you have and he knows how to
[42:31] meet them better than anyone else
[42:35] because he can see to the very deepest
[42:38] symptom and root and he's able to meet
[42:41] that
[42:43] need he's worthy to be praised isn't he
[42:47] amen I just wanted to uh give you a
[42:50] couple of prayer requests that have come
[42:53] in uh one that we've been aware of
[42:56] through the day and evening last night
[42:58] but we just uh had a little message here
[43:00] from Sister Sally Duke and uh brother
[43:04] Bobby is fighting
[43:05] shingles and it sounds like it's quite a
[43:08] battle how many of you know that the
[43:10] Lord is above it all he's bigger than
[43:14] every problem and he's bigger than every
[43:16] situation and we know that the Lord can
[43:19] how many of you were here last night we
[43:22] we we're just about to go to the Lord in
[43:24] prayer but what a meeting we had
[43:27] God just showed up I don't know what
[43:29] time you left but it was after midnight
[43:31] I think before we were pulling out of
[43:34] here in fact I think the church was
[43:36] locked at about 12:40 that's nearly 1:00
[43:40] and uh we just saw God doing so many
[43:43] wonderful things and the same God is
[43:45] here tonight amen a lot of you most all
[43:49] of you know uh Luke and and Megan yovic
[43:53] who were here last night and their
[43:55] beautiful children
[43:57] and uh if there's ever been a mama who
[44:01] loves being a mama and a Daddy who loves
[44:03] being a Daddy it's that too and uh there
[44:07] are a lot of people who believe that
[44:09] it's all Megan you know that she's the
[44:12] one who wants all the children but I
[44:14] want you to know that means you just
[44:16] don't know them very well because if you
[44:19] did you would know that uh Luke also is
[44:24] very happy when the news comes that God
[44:27] is going to bless them with another baby
[44:29] we don't understand all of these things
[44:32] but we know that he is worthy to be
[44:36] praised so we gathered around last night
[44:39] without saying what the need was but
[44:42] they had gotten some very hard news uh
[44:45] yesterday morning a routine uh scan and
[44:49] there had been a little bit of concern
[44:52] uh because there there was seemed to be
[44:55] no movement all of a sudden and um but
[44:58] just believing you know that things were
[45:00] going to be better and uh so when they
[45:03] did the ultrasound
[45:06] unexpectedly they found out and said
[45:09] that the little baby had ceased to live
[45:13] uh perhaps even a a week or so maybe
[45:16] even a little bit longer and uh it was
[45:20] so hard you know for that little family
[45:22] all the children were there for the scan
[45:26] and so it was so difficult and uh Luke
[45:31] was just uh his response was faith I'm
[45:35] going to believe I'm going to believe
[45:38] you know
[45:42] Lazarus uh he was in the grave three
[45:44] days and three
[45:46] nights and even his sisters knew that uh
[45:49] things were bad and the voice of the
[45:53] Resurrection uh brought life to Lazarus
[45:57] and and so I didn't feel I didn't feel
[46:00] uh silly or uh I didn't feel like it was
[46:03] a crazy thing for us to agree with them
[46:07] and they didn't want to tell very many
[46:08] people you know why they said we don't
[46:11] want anybody meaning well of course but
[46:14] we don't want anybody speaking anything
[46:16] but
[46:19] life I want you to know that I am a
[46:22] pride and proud that's not a good word
[46:25] but I am a very very very proud Pastor
[46:29] tonight of their
[46:32] response that it wasn't panic and it
[46:36] wasn't bitterness their response was
[46:39] we're going to do nothing until we give
[46:42] God another opportunity to move and
[46:46] we've seen God
[46:47] move we've seen the resurrection power
[46:51] we know what God can do but
[46:54] unfortunately this morning when they uh
[46:57] went in and did another check and and
[47:00] did another scan they found also again
[47:03] that the little uh baby was not alive
[47:07] and uh they had already named the baby
[47:09] because she was what
[47:11] 20 20 weeks well that changes the whole
[47:16] Dynamics because that's uh pretty much
[47:19] halfway through or more and and so
[47:22] tonight there she's there in the
[47:25] hospital and and Luke is there and uh
[47:27] they're doing you know what they what
[47:29] they have to do and what they need to do
[47:32] so that her health is preserved and uh
[47:36] would you just believe God for the for
[47:40] the purpose and the
[47:43] why to bring forth a greater glory in
[47:47] their lives we don't always get to know
[47:50] why but you know sometimes we do and I
[47:54] had a little quickening in my heart
[47:56] today day that God was going to give
[47:59] them a why he was going to let them know
[48:03] and he was going to help roll them over
[48:05] this uh very very difficult uh situation
[48:08] they want to be here tonight they want
[48:12] to be singing and worshiping with us
[48:15] here tonight but uh it just wasn't it
[48:18] just wasn't possible for them to to be
[48:20] that so I wanted to bring you the
[48:22] seriousness of their need and tell you
[48:25] that we want to hold them them up to the
[48:28] Lord in prayer through a dark and a
[48:31] difficult time their testimony to me all
[48:34] day has been we trust God he is
[48:38] Sovereign he is Holy he never makes a
[48:42] mistake he never
[48:44] fails amen and and uh I I'm thankful for
[48:49] that the Lord gives and the Lord takes
[48:52] away and he does it for a purpose he
[48:55] does it for a reason and so would you
[48:58] particularly hold them up to the Lord
[49:01] tonight in prayer
[49:07] amen

[1:04:43] shosanna sings
[1:04:46] Tonight this song is not by accident I
[1:04:50] had no intentions of singing this camp
[1:04:52] meeting prise God glory because there's
[1:04:55] been a song the Lord's
[1:04:56] been brooding in my heart for the last
[1:04:59] year and I knew I couldn't sing it until
[1:05:01] after this week so I hadn't bothered to
[1:05:04] practice
[1:05:05] anything shortly after 4:00 this
[1:05:08] afternoon in my home the Holy Spirit
[1:05:11] impressed me so strongly Hallelujah said
[1:05:14] pick up your phone and text Benjamin
[1:05:16] tell them you're available this is the
[1:05:19] first song I ever sing in this
[1:05:22] church it's a song that got me through
[1:05:24] some pretty dark nights
[1:05:26] and before brother shell shared anything
[1:05:29] about Luke and make the Lord had
[1:05:30] impressed on my heart to share
[1:05:34] this he's still God still
[1:05:37] God when he takes the
[1:05:40] twins he's still God when the hurricane
[1:05:43] washes away the mountain he's still
[1:05:47] God when cancer looks like it's winning
[1:05:50] it's not it's just doing God's
[1:05:53] business he's still God
[1:05:56] he doesn't always save us from the fire
[1:06:00] he doesn't always take us from The Trial
[1:06:03] something that struck my heart so strong
[1:06:05] last night when Brother David was
[1:06:06] preaching was when the trial begins
[1:06:09] don't pray it away that's where your
[1:06:11] testimony is and it just struck me
[1:06:14] because I thought Lord how many times
[1:06:17] have I got on my face and said can you
[1:06:19] please take this cup for me right we
[1:06:22] do it doesn't mean the bloodline isn't
[1:06:26] strong it doesn't mean his grace isn't
[1:06:29] sufficient it doesn't mean he's not
[1:06:32] faithful when you don't get the answer
[1:06:34] you prayed for amen he's still
[1:06:37] God that's right exactly
[1:06:49] right even though my spirit is
[1:06:53] low and it seems I can't hardly go but
[1:06:59] still I see
[1:07:05] Victory many times I'm just walking by

[1:09:35] [Music]
[1:09:37] blood you may sare and you may fight but
[1:09:42] you've already lost this battle tonight

[1:09:59] this battle tonight
[1:10:03] remember you can't cross the
[1:10:09] [Music]
[1:10:12] bloodline do you believe
[1:10:15] that there is a
[1:10:18] bloodline oh
[1:10:23] hallelujah it's it's it's not the
[1:10:26] chemistry of the blood it's the
[1:10:29] life you may be seated it's the life
[1:10:32] that's in the blood that's what stands
[1:10:35] in the way that's what keeps the enemy
[1:10:38] at Bay I I if you had a great big old
[1:10:42] jar tonight of the literal blood of
[1:10:45] Jesus the chemistry in that blood
[1:10:49] couldn't help you one little bit but the
[1:10:52] life that's in it and now that life has
[1:10:56] been transferred to
[1:10:58] us where is the blood of Jesus I'll tell
[1:11:01] you where it it's right here it's in me
[1:11:05] the life that was in that blood is now
[1:11:08] in The
[1:11:09] Believer oh the word has bled
[1:11:15] again you believe that don't you it's
[1:11:18] bleeding again in this little bride we
[1:11:23] carry that life with us us I I can't
[1:11:27] hardly wait to hear what God has to say
[1:11:30] to us this evening the time is getting
[1:11:33] away from us and if I take much more
[1:11:36] time brother Dwayne won't sing and we
[1:11:39] want him to sing before he preaches so I
[1:11:43] I just can't really say much I I mean he
[1:11:46] didn't tell me that but but but it's
[1:11:49] getting it's getting I I want him to
[1:11:51] have lots of time so go ahead and get
[1:11:54] ready to give would you do that right
[1:11:57] now would you uh reach in and reach over
[1:12:01] and uh dig deep tonight because there
[1:12:04] are expenses in hosting a meeting like
[1:12:07] this and the and one of the biggest is
[1:12:10] simply to bless these men of God a
[1:12:15] laborer is worthy of his hire I shocked
[1:12:20] brother I kind of shocked Brother David
[1:12:22] Templeton last night when I told him
[1:12:24] about my good friend brother Bill yach
[1:12:28] he knew brother Bill well but he sure
[1:12:30] was shocked when I told him that more
[1:12:32] than once brother Bill had to come and
[1:12:35] bail me out where I was preaching a
[1:12:37] Revival around this message and I needed
[1:12:40] gas money to get
[1:12:43] home now can you imagine that going and
[1:12:47] carrying the
[1:12:48] word and not even having enough to pay
[1:12:52] the gas bill to get home uh I I said can
[1:12:56] you loan me a little money to get home I
[1:12:57] didn't have a credit card in those days
[1:13:00] and he said no but I'll give you some if
[1:13:02] you'll come by our way have you got
[1:13:04] enough to get yeah I've got enough then
[1:13:06] he said we'll give you biscuit and
[1:13:09] gravy and fill your tank you know I'm so
[1:13:13] thankful for every time God used
[1:13:15] somebody like that when I was out there
[1:13:18] now these men are not
[1:13:20] destitute they have they have they have
[1:13:23] income but they have brought us the
[1:13:26] finest and they have yielded themselves
[1:13:30] and more serious than that they have
[1:13:33] become somewhat identified with us by
[1:13:36] preaching here and and that could that
[1:13:39] could actually put a mark on them uh if
[1:13:42] you don't pray so let's give tonight and
[1:13:46] believe that God's going to bless I want
[1:13:48] to see these Ministries go to another
[1:13:51] level don't you father we bring this to
[1:13:54] you
[1:13:55] we're not trying to pull persuade or
[1:13:57] Force we're we're just trying to to let
[1:14:00] the people know that the the need for
[1:14:03] the preachers hadn't been met yet but we
[1:14:05] believe that you've got it we're not
[1:14:08] going to worry over it we're going to
[1:14:09] put it in your hands we're going to
[1:14:12] believe that when they leave us that
[1:14:15] they will be rightfully blessed Lord we
[1:14:18] have been so blessed multiply this to
[1:14:22] meet every need that they might have in

[1:18:39] 7:30 this
[1:18:42] morning he he has just been so rich he
[1:18:46] has been so rich to me today I was
[1:18:50] telling brother Steve it was about 3
[1:18:51] o'clock this morning when I finally was
[1:18:54] able to slip away into a little rest and
[1:18:57] back up the Lord woke me up about 7:30
[1:19:01] this morning and his presence was just
[1:19:02] so so rich and sweet with me I sat sat
[1:19:08] down at the table and fixed a cup of
[1:19:11] coffee and I was just just dwelling in
[1:19:14] his presence and reading scriptures and
[1:19:16] he come down in the room and I literally
[1:19:19] sat there at the table for over 30
[1:19:22] minutes couldn't speak I couldn't do
[1:19:24] anything I was just trembling my body
[1:19:27] was trembling under his presence and
[1:19:29] under his anointing the thing is is I
[1:19:33] didn't leave it back at sister Sharon's
[1:19:36] house no sir I brought it with me he's
[1:19:40] with me right now he's with you right
[1:19:43] now and it's going to be amazing to see
[1:19:47] what he will do this
[1:19:49] evening I'd say you can be seated you're
[1:19:52] welcome to be seated for just just a
[1:19:53] moment I'm going to I'm to try to sing a
[1:19:55] song um I chose this song because if I
[1:19:58] start messing it up brother Steve can
[1:19:59] jump in and sing it because this is his
[1:20:02] song but this song has blessed me for so
[1:20:05] many years and it says by my
[1:20:11] testimony not brother Steve's
[1:20:14] testimony not my dad's testimony I love
[1:20:17] hearing my dad's testimony I love
[1:20:20] hearing my pastor's
[1:20:21] testimony but their testimony is not
[1:20:25] what gets me through that's I don't
[1:20:28] overcome by their
[1:20:31] testimony I
[1:20:32] overcome by my testimony and the blood
[1:20:37] of the
[1:20:38] Lamb there is a part we must play the
[1:20:41] blood of the Lamb I may have said it
[1:20:43] here before the blood of the Lamb is a
[1:20:44] constant this is an equation that we've
[1:20:46] been given that's I love mathematical
[1:20:49] equations they always work so it's an
[1:20:52] equation the blood of the Lamb is a
[1:20:54] constant
[1:20:55] the only variable in US overcoming is
[1:20:59] whether we're going to give our
[1:21:00] testimony or
[1:21:03] not so you can choose to overcome or you
[1:21:06] can choose to sit with your hands folded
[1:21:08] and still suffer the same thing over and
[1:21:11] over give me I think you said be flat
[1:21:15] I've got to sing so I
[1:21:17] can get this off my heart well by my
[1:21:21] testimony
[1:21:23] [Music]

[1:33:43] in a private message and within his
[1:33:46] notes that he sent to you and I I talked
[1:33:49] to him about this and he said he really
[1:33:51] didn't even know why he was using the
[1:33:53] words that he was
[1:33:54] using he said NH HRM we have three more
[1:33:58] days of camp meeting to climb
[1:34:02] mountains don't
[1:34:04] stall or
[1:34:06] divert keep keep those words in in in
[1:34:09] your mind push onward and
[1:34:12] upward he is getting he's speaking of
[1:34:15] God he is getting the preeminence in all
[1:34:18] things total
[1:34:20] breakthrough is in sight and when I read
[1:34:24] that I'm looking at my notes I'm saying
[1:34:26] break through the barriers that that was
[1:34:28] that was what I was wanting to speak
[1:34:30] that's what the Lord was impressing me
[1:34:32] and that's what he was dealing with me
[1:34:33] this morning was breaking through the
[1:34:37] barriers and I know thank you Jesus I
[1:34:40] don't I don't say that I don't claim to
[1:34:42] have a spirit of
[1:34:44] discernment but God does allow me to see
[1:34:46] things at
[1:34:47] times and even in the service at the end
[1:34:50] of the service last night there are
[1:34:52] those that I fully 100 100% believe I
[1:34:57] witnessed a breakthrough Hallelujah am
[1:35:01] but there were
[1:35:02] others that got close yeah they got
[1:35:06] close and they pulled back they stalled
[1:35:11] yes they diverted yes come on now they
[1:35:14] did not continue to push
[1:35:18] through please don't let that be don't
[1:35:20] let that happen tonight
[1:35:23] brother Steve just told me don't worry
[1:35:25] about the time that's right so I'm going
[1:35:28] to tell you tell you don't worry about
[1:35:30] the
[1:35:31] time and I'm not saying don't worry
[1:35:33] about the time that I'm ministering I'm
[1:35:35] talking about don't don't worry about
[1:35:37] time when it comes to Eternal
[1:35:40] things if you're still trying to push
[1:35:43] through we're going to stay and push
[1:35:45] through with
[1:35:46] you why else would we be here our
[1:35:50] ultimate goal is to see you make it and
[1:35:54] if you continue to be repressed you you
[1:35:57] continue to stall you're never going to
[1:35:59] break through that barrier Romans
[1:36:03] chapter 8 verse 38 verse 39 reads for I
[1:36:07] am
[1:36:08] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:36:12] nor angels nor
[1:36:15] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:36:19] present nor things to come nor height
[1:36:23] nor depth nor any other creature shall
[1:36:27] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:36:30] God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:36:35] lord and if you have him in you then
[1:36:39] that love of God is dwelling in you this
[1:36:41] evening also one more place as you're
[1:36:44] still standing and then I'll let you
[1:36:46] have your seat second Corinthians chap
[1:36:49] 10 veres 4 and 5 you could quote it
[1:36:53] without even turning to it I'm
[1:36:56] sure would you read it with me
[1:36:59] tonight for the weapons of our Warfare
[1:37:03] are not carnal But Mighty through God to
[1:37:07] the pulling down of
[1:37:10] strongholds casting down
[1:37:13] imaginations and every High thing that
[1:37:16] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[1:37:20] God and bringing into captivity every
[1:37:24] thought to The Obedience of Christ amen
[1:37:29] you can have your seats see I'm so
[1:37:32] thankful that you read it it came out
[1:37:35] across your lips tonight as well it
[1:37:37] wasn't just me reading it to you you
[1:37:40] were acknowledging that the weapons of
[1:37:42] our Warfare are not are not carnal the
[1:37:45] reason being is our Warfare is not
[1:37:49] carnal if our Warfare was carnal then he
[1:37:53] would give us carnal weapons to fight
[1:37:56] with but our Warfare is a spiritual
[1:37:59] warfare yes sir our Warfare is not to be
[1:38:02] with each other right it's not to be
[1:38:05] debating is this or is that I heard
[1:38:08] brother I was sharing with somebody the
[1:38:09] other day I said brother Dan Dey had a a
[1:38:11] very simple way of bringing things
[1:38:12] across and he said he he could take
[1:38:15] profound things and make it very simple
[1:38:17] something I could understand and and he
[1:38:19] said that that many times he would be in
[1:38:22] at preachers meetings and he said I
[1:38:24] didn't like going to them he said
[1:38:27] because they they just wanted to argue
[1:38:30] and fuss and fight over he said it was
[1:38:34] it was silly things and he said let me
[1:38:36] give you an example he said there are
[1:38:38] there are preachers that want to tell
[1:38:40] you and they are adamant that when God
[1:38:42] when when God comes back he's coming
[1:38:44] back on a white
[1:38:47] horse and he said I'll say Amen with
[1:38:49] them he says and then the person sitting
[1:38:51] next to him says no
[1:38:54] he's coming back on a white
[1:38:56] cloud and he said I'll say Amen to them
[1:39:00] and he said I don't care if he's coming
[1:39:03] back in a white
[1:39:06] Cadillac all I know is that he's coming
[1:39:09] back and I need to be
[1:39:11] ready so we could sit and argue and fuss
[1:39:14] and bicker and fight over how he's doing
[1:39:17] it that's right or we could take that
[1:39:20] time to make sure you're ready when he
[1:39:22] comes
[1:39:25] it doesn't matter to me how he does it I
[1:39:27] just want to know that my life is lining
[1:39:30] up with the word so when he does come
[1:39:33] I'm not going to be left alone I I I I'm
[1:39:36] not one of those people that that um
[1:39:38] years ago there was somebody that did a
[1:39:40] a series of books of called Left Behind
[1:39:43] never have read them I don't plan to
[1:39:45] read
[1:39:46] them I don't I have no need to take time
[1:39:51] out of my life to read a series of books
[1:39:54] called Left
[1:39:56] Behind if I saw a set maybe I give it to
[1:39:58] somebody else that I thought might need
[1:40:04] it maybe it would help them but it's not
[1:40:06] going to help me I don't plan on being
[1:40:08] left behind so what I want to do is make
[1:40:10] sure I'm doing everything I can to be
[1:40:12] ready to
[1:40:14] go amen I'm so thankful that I I'm in a
[1:40:17] group of people that agree on those
[1:40:19] things that's right first John chapter 4
[1:40:23] verse 16-9 says and we have known and
[1:40:25] believed the love that God hath to us
[1:40:28] God is love and he that dwelleth in love
[1:40:32] dwelleth in God and God in him herein is
[1:40:37] our love made perfect that we may have
[1:40:40] boldness in the day of judgment because
[1:40:43] as he is so are we in this world and and
[1:40:47] and verse 18 just is so bold to me there
[1:40:50] is no fear in in
[1:40:57] love all right so you you got to go back
[1:41:00] and you look it before that that that he
[1:41:02] if he dwelleth in you how many claims
[1:41:06] that he dwells in you yes
[1:41:09] absolutely
[1:41:12] okay then there is no fear that's
[1:41:20] right you just said that he dwelt in
[1:41:24] you and the scripture says that he is
[1:41:30] love and there is no fear in
[1:41:35] love so whenever you start to
[1:41:39] feel that fear creeping
[1:41:43] in kick it
[1:41:45] out you can immediate immediately know
[1:41:50] that is not of God whatever ever is
[1:41:54] causing that fear to come toward you and
[1:41:57] to come into your home and into your
[1:41:59] life immediately sever that and you're
[1:42:03] like well that might be one of my
[1:42:05] friends it might be one of your
[1:42:09] friends and maybe you need to check your
[1:42:13] friendships and I'm not I'm not trying
[1:42:15] to accuse nobody I'm not trying to tell
[1:42:17] you you need to call all of your friends
[1:42:19] and say you brother Dwayne said I can't
[1:42:21] be friends with you no more what I am
[1:42:23] telling you if they are hindering your
[1:42:26] walk be
[1:42:28] careful check
[1:42:30] it if there if anything is hindering
[1:42:33] your walk why would why would you want
[1:42:35] to fellowship with
[1:42:37] that because it's not drawing you closer
[1:42:40] to God it is drawing you further away
[1:42:44] from his presence there is no fear in
[1:42:46] love but perfect love casteth out fear
[1:42:51] so that's your opport to to cast them
[1:42:55] out they try to bring that into your
[1:42:57] home you cast them out say no I'm not
[1:43:00] I'm not letting you bring fear I'm not
[1:43:02] letting you bring anxiety I'm not
[1:43:04] letting you bring worry I'm not letting
[1:43:05] you bring doubt see those are all types
[1:43:07] of things that become
[1:43:10] barriers in our life like I said I'm
[1:43:12] trying to speak to you on break through
[1:43:15] the
[1:43:16] barriers break through don't come up to
[1:43:19] them and stall out
[1:43:27] yeah he that fearth is not made perfect
[1:43:31] in
[1:43:32] love and I know in this flesh we
[1:43:36] struggle with things like that it it's
[1:43:39] so easy to fear and worry to to to come
[1:43:43] on come on you but it's at that moment
[1:43:46] that you have to recognize what's
[1:43:48] happening Hallelujah that's right I'm
[1:43:50] not saying that if you have Christ
[1:43:52] dwelling within you that you're never
[1:43:54] going to face a battle of fear but I'm
[1:43:58] telling you that you have a praise that
[1:44:01] you can give you have a word of God that
[1:44:03] you can give that can cast that fear out
[1:44:07] of your life and don't sit there and
[1:44:10] dwell on it I like I was telling someone
[1:44:13] the other day it's a little bit little
[1:44:15] bit back now I was telling them I said
[1:44:17] that you you know if if if you're
[1:44:19] dealing with something you're struggling
[1:44:21] with a certain thing in your life
[1:44:23] life be careful who you talk to about
[1:44:29] it cuz sometimes it's so easy to pick up
[1:44:32] that phone and call your favorite gossip
[1:44:35] I mean favorite uh person you share
[1:44:38] information
[1:44:41] with I want to call it gossip because
[1:44:43] somebody might get offended at me but
[1:44:45] you like to share information with and
[1:44:50] um and then that person wants to share
[1:44:52] that information with other people and
[1:44:54] it shared with other people and all it
[1:44:56] does is build
[1:44:59] negativity I I was so I was so thankful
[1:45:02] to hear what you were saying about the
[1:45:05] family of them they they they did not
[1:45:07] want negative talk and there's still no
[1:45:11] negative talk being being spoken now see
[1:45:15] what they exhibited is that they Trust
[1:45:18] In The Sovereign
[1:45:21] God what a God we serve and that is so
[1:45:23] hard for us to do in our flesh yes sir
[1:45:27] but the spirit if his Spirit dwells
[1:45:29] inside of
[1:45:31] you that spirit is what can call out to
[1:45:34] his spirit and that can agree those two
[1:45:37] can agree this flesh does not agree with
[1:45:39] that
[1:45:40] Spirit it doesn't but the spir if his
[1:45:43] Spirit dwells inside of you it can agree
[1:45:46] with his spirit and you can and it can
[1:45:48] say I trust in a sovereign God
[1:45:53] and his
[1:45:54] will his will is always
[1:45:58] perfect many times he allows our will as
[1:46:04] a permissive
[1:46:06] will and he'll allow you to even go
[1:46:09] through a permissive will and and
[1:46:11] receive some blessings even in a
[1:46:13] permissive will state but that is not my
[1:46:16] desire to stay in a permissive will my
[1:46:20] desire is to know his perfect will and
[1:46:23] it enter into his perfect
[1:46:25] will there there was a story in in in
[1:46:28] the Bible uh in the Book of Esther um
[1:46:31] chapter 4 and and I'm not going to read
[1:46:34] I've got it I've got it all written out
[1:46:36] and I could do that but if y'all would
[1:46:37] give me uh a a liberty to to just kind
[1:46:41] of paraphrase and and put it in in my
[1:46:44] words would that be okay I promise you
[1:46:46] I'm not going to take anything away from
[1:46:48] it I'm not adding anything to it I'm
[1:46:51] just putting it into uh a a more
[1:46:53] condensed version in the in Esther
[1:46:56] chapter 4 see Esther chapter 3 is
[1:47:01] whenever a decree was going
[1:47:03] out you know they were sending out a
[1:47:05] decree hmon was was going to have have
[1:47:08] all the Jews
[1:47:09] killed so in in Esther chapter 4 um you
[1:47:13] hear the story of Esther having a
[1:47:17] conversation with
[1:47:18] morai how many how many knows the story
[1:47:21] they they have a conversation and uh and
[1:47:23] so for for so many years brother Steve
[1:47:25] whenever I would listen to that that
[1:47:28] being preached on her I would just I
[1:47:29] would kind of just Breeze over that
[1:47:31] story in my
[1:47:34] mind I saw I go over here since you're
[1:47:37] sitting down right here in my M my
[1:47:40] mind's eye y'all can't see me over there
[1:47:42] I'm sorry I'm sitting down in the chair
[1:47:44] beside brother Steve I pictured Esther
[1:47:47] sitting down beside Mori and having a
[1:47:50] conversation and saying hey um you Mori
[1:47:54] says hey did you hear what's going on
[1:47:56] did you hear what uh what Hon's doing
[1:47:59] and Esther would say um no not exactly
[1:48:02] he said well hey look at this decree
[1:48:04] read read what they said what's going to
[1:48:06] happen and um and so in my mind I'm
[1:48:08] seeing this conversation played out that
[1:48:11] that uh Esther you know says to Mori
[1:48:13] something and morai responds back and
[1:48:16] she they just have they carry on a
[1:48:17] conversation just like brother Steve and
[1:48:18] I could while we're sitting here but
[1:48:21] read through chapter 4
[1:48:24] you know what stood between Esther and
[1:48:29] morai
[1:48:32] hatak hatak was a
[1:48:35] messenger they did not sit down and
[1:48:39] share a
[1:48:40] conversation something that was leading
[1:48:43] her to potentially give up her
[1:48:47] life I mean it it could have been very
[1:48:50] detrimental for her to walk into the
[1:48:52] king chamber because that's what she was
[1:48:54] telling Mori she said hey you you do
[1:48:58] realize what you're asking me to do is
[1:49:00] against the law
[1:49:02] absolutely and I I'm sure the fear that
[1:49:06] she was feeling because she probably
[1:49:08] either had heard witness of it of them
[1:49:11] carrying that law out or there would
[1:49:13] have been no reason for a trembling
[1:49:15] there would have been no reason for a
[1:49:17] concerned if she did not I forgot I have
[1:49:19] this other thing on yall excuse me
[1:49:24] I I'm going to set that down now I can I
[1:49:27] can use both my
[1:49:32] hands now I can get comfortable praise
[1:49:35] the Lord so so you have Esther speaking
[1:49:40] to
[1:49:41] Mori having this conversation and yet
[1:49:44] the conversation was not in the same
[1:49:48] room Mori was out at the gate sack cloth
[1:49:52] and Ash
[1:49:53] he he was out there Esther was trying to
[1:49:55] get him some other clothes saying you
[1:49:57] know you don't need to dress like that
[1:49:59] here put put some some other garments on
[1:50:01] and they're hav't but everything that
[1:50:03] they spoke about was carried through a
[1:50:10] messenger how many times have you seen
[1:50:13] the little game
[1:50:14] played where you tell one person
[1:50:18] something and you want them to go tell
[1:50:20] brother Daniel you want brother Daniel
[1:50:22] to go back and tell brother Brian and
[1:50:23] and you you keep going around and and
[1:50:25] each one tells and it comes down to this
[1:50:27] side and then they say what the message
[1:50:30] was and
[1:50:31] typically it's totally different than
[1:50:35] what it started with over here that's
[1:50:37] how it
[1:50:38] works but see the thing was is hatak had
[1:50:42] no message of his
[1:50:45] own he simply carried a word from
[1:50:51] Esther to to morai Hallelujah and then
[1:50:55] he listened to what mori's response was
[1:50:58] and he took that response didn't add
[1:51:01] anything to
[1:51:03] it didn't put his own idea to it he took
[1:51:07] that response and went back to Esther
[1:51:09] but Esther had to have
[1:51:12] faith to
[1:51:14] trust in the messenger that was speaking
[1:51:17] to her if she would have failed to have
[1:51:20] faith it would have cost her her life
[1:51:25] I don't know if you're picking up what
[1:51:26] I'm trying to to put in front of
[1:51:31] you but
[1:51:33] sometimes no not sometimes all the
[1:51:37] time we must have faith in a messenger
[1:51:42] that God
[1:51:43] places in your life that when he speaks
[1:51:47] to you that he's speaking directly what
[1:51:50] God wants you and needs you to hear
[1:51:54] Esther could have sit there whenever
[1:51:56] hatat comes back to her and says morai
[1:52:00] said you need to go into the king's
[1:52:03] chamber even though you haven't been
[1:52:05] invited and Esther could have stopped
[1:52:08] and
[1:52:10] said that doesn't sound like something
[1:52:12] he would have said I mean I've I've
[1:52:14] known him a long
[1:52:16] time that's completely contrary to what
[1:52:19] he would have been telling me I mean he
[1:52:21] loves me he doesn't want me to to lose
[1:52:24] my
[1:52:25] life but no she had it wasn't that she
[1:52:28] was so much having faith in the
[1:52:32] message she had to actually trust the
[1:52:34] messenger that was bringing the message
[1:52:36] to her she had to trust that this person
[1:52:40] was only going to say what the other
[1:52:42] person said for them to say and it had
[1:52:45] to go both ways whenever Esther sent a
[1:52:47] message back to Mori they had to have
[1:52:50] faith that this person was only
[1:52:53] delivering what the other person said
[1:52:56] all right so bring it bring it on down
[1:52:58] to where I think in chapter 5 whenever
[1:53:01] she um she goes into the
[1:53:05] door see let's pull back a second let's
[1:53:09] let's let's think of her standing at the
[1:53:11] door uhuh
[1:53:13] yes what do you think was going through
[1:53:15] her
[1:53:17] mind when she
[1:53:20] stood maybe it was a door I don't know
[1:53:23] if the door was a 2in thick door if it
[1:53:24] was a 4 in I don't know I don't know how
[1:53:26] big the door was I don't how he how
[1:53:28] heavy the door was but I know for a
[1:53:31] moment she stood on one side of the door
[1:53:35] and a decision had to be
[1:53:41] made either I opened the door and I
[1:53:44] walked through you didn't know that I
[1:53:47] was going to say
[1:53:50] that either I opened the door and I I
[1:53:52] walk through or I stand on this side of
[1:53:54] the
[1:53:56] door and I receive fate whatever is
[1:53:59] going to befall me Mori was saying if
[1:54:02] you don't do it you're surely going to
[1:54:04] die surely going to die when she stood
[1:54:06] at that door she had to face the fear if
[1:54:10] I go beyond this barrier it could be
[1:54:14] death talk to us
[1:54:16] brother so the battle was at that
[1:54:20] barrier the pressure was at that barrier
[1:54:23] when she just got up to it right and and
[1:54:26] and she could she could have made a
[1:54:28] choice you know it's too risky I'm going
[1:54:32] to pull back I'm not going to continue
[1:54:34] to push through because I don't know
[1:54:36] exactly what is going to happen on the
[1:54:39] other side of that barrier that's
[1:54:41] standing in my
[1:54:46] way our fleshly desire wants to know the
[1:54:49] end oh yeah we want to know how God is
[1:54:53] going to do it amen we want to know when
[1:54:55] God is going to do it we want to know
[1:54:58] why he is doing it we want to know where
[1:55:01] it's going to happen that's the human
[1:55:03] nature of us I'm I'm not I'm not casting
[1:55:06] that aside I'm I'm recognizing that that
[1:55:09] is that's who we are as humans but we go
[1:55:12] deeper than being
[1:55:14] human sir if you have his life dwelling
[1:55:17] inside of you you've got to feed that
[1:55:21] life don't feed the flesh with fear
[1:55:24] don't feed the flesh with doubt don't
[1:55:26] feed the flesh with what you see with
[1:55:29] these eyes and all your eyes see is this
[1:55:33] this wall or this this door in front of
[1:55:35] me and I don't know if I push through
[1:55:39] that exactly what's going to happen
[1:55:40] what's it going to cost me right if I
[1:55:43] actually push through and I get a
[1:55:45] breakthrough what's it going to cost me
[1:55:48] in the in at the end so I feel like by
[1:55:52] what I read in the scriptures that she
[1:55:54] actually stood there and struggled with
[1:55:56] that I would I I I could imagine her
[1:55:59] standing there
[1:56:02] trembling do I do I do I
[1:56:06] trust what morai is telling me to do is
[1:56:10] that really what God wants me to do
[1:56:12] about it or or I'm safe right
[1:56:16] now I'm I'm safe right here there's I
[1:56:19] don't see anybody that's going to harm
[1:56:20] me that's going to kill me maybe I can I
[1:56:22] can break through and and break away
[1:56:24] from that and and I can save my
[1:56:27] life but see she got to that place and
[1:56:29] then she she had to push through yes
[1:56:32] that fear she had to overcome that doubt
[1:56:37] did and break through that door and it
[1:56:39] says she went in and she went into to
[1:56:41] the inner the inner chamber inner Court
[1:56:44] I forgot how it's I've got it written
[1:56:46] down um exactly I I I know that it was
[1:56:50] the inner Court of the King's house
[1:56:52] that's Esther 51 so where she stood
[1:56:55] whenever you look at inner Court of the
[1:56:58] King's house that was referring to the
[1:57:02] what we would it's it was referring to
[1:57:04] the middle wall of partition if you look
[1:57:06] at her and a herodian temple the way it
[1:57:09] was laid out that's what it was
[1:57:11] referring to which we would know it was
[1:57:14] a veil we would consider in the temple
[1:57:17] that's right that that was the veil that
[1:57:19] signified the veil but see we know
[1:57:23] in Ephesians he says that that it's been
[1:57:25] torn down Hallelujah I believe so now
[1:57:30] for
[1:57:31] us there's nothing that's standing
[1:57:34] between Christ and you except your own
[1:57:40] fear your own worry he has opened it up
[1:57:44] that is theuth called for you to come in
[1:57:47] to the inner
[1:57:49] chamber to have communion with him we
[1:57:53] heard about that last night to
[1:57:56] experience um unhindered communion
[1:57:59] hallelujah hallelujah that's his desire
[1:58:02] it is he has made the way possible he
[1:58:05] has taken down the middle wall of of a
[1:58:09] petition and opened it up for us to
[1:58:11] enter into his presence but too many
[1:58:15] people still think about things that was
[1:58:17] in their past well that wasn't the way
[1:58:19] we did
[1:58:20] it where I used to come
[1:58:23] from that wasn't the way that I've been
[1:58:26] taught for the last 40
[1:58:28] years well get past your past come on
[1:58:33] accept what God has for you in this very
[1:58:37] moment step into his presence break
[1:58:41] through the barrier of your past many
[1:58:43] times that becomes one of the biggest
[1:58:44] barriers for people is our past and
[1:58:47] Satan loves to bring up your past right
[1:58:50] he wants to whether it's good what he
[1:58:53] would call good or negative or bad he
[1:58:56] just wants you to dwell in the
[1:58:58] past we don't need to dwell in the
[1:59:00] things of the past no sir that was back
[1:59:02] there I'm not supposed to look
[1:59:04] back look back Lot's wife she was told
[1:59:08] don't look
[1:59:10] back he's called you out of that why
[1:59:13] would you ever want to look back to
[1:59:15] where you came
[1:59:16] from Leave it behind you and walk into
[1:59:20] his glory that he has opened up to you
[1:59:24] through his word the freedom that he has
[1:59:27] invited you to come
[1:59:29] in he wants to commune Hallelujah he
[1:59:32] wants to have an intimate Hallelujah
[1:59:37] relationship that's what communion is
[1:59:39] talking about an intimate relationship
[1:59:42] with you that's right why would you ever
[1:59:45] want to push that
[1:59:48] aside how are you ever going to receive
[1:59:51] his word
[1:59:53] in your body if you never have that time
[1:59:56] of
[1:59:57] communion with your
[2:00:00] bridegroom you'll never receive it
[2:00:03] that's right you'll die you will die if
[2:00:06] you don't receive his word coming into
[2:00:09] you
[2:00:12] amen the message greatest battle ever
[2:00:16] fought sister charity I don't know if
[2:00:18] I'll use all my notes or not she she
[2:00:21] said I forgot to send my notes to her
[2:00:23] earlier and she said um you didn't use
[2:00:26] your notes Wednesday night so if you
[2:00:27] just winging it and um I said I'll try
[2:00:30] to send send you my
[2:00:32] notes especially the the the uh the ones
[2:00:36] the quotes it's a lot harder for them to
[2:00:38] pick that up that fast greatest battle
[2:00:41] ever
[2:00:42] fought says see it's your mind that
[2:00:46] opens up the door or closes the
[2:00:50] door and listen to your conscience
[2:00:53] listens to your memory listens to your
[2:00:59] affections but when your mind closes
[2:01:01] itself to these things and let God the
[2:01:05] spirit of his word come
[2:01:07] in it blows the rest of the stuff
[2:01:12] out every doubt is
[2:01:16] gone every fear is
[2:01:19] gone every sensation of Doubt is he he
[2:01:23] wasn't leaving anything in there every
[2:01:26] sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling
[2:01:29] is gone there's nothing standing there
[2:01:32] but the word of God and Satan cannot
[2:01:39] battle against that no sir he cannot
[2:01:43] battle against it brother Brown says now
[2:01:46] we know that's true a little bit later
[2:01:48] in that same message he he continues on
[2:01:51] that thought he said open up that mind
[2:01:53] that's good that's good that's the
[2:01:55] Battleground that's where the battle
[2:01:57] sits in Array right here in the front
[2:02:00] line that's right your mind open it up
[2:02:03] and say every doubt I doubt my doubts
[2:02:07] doubt
[2:02:10] doubts I recognize my doubts but I'm
[2:02:14] doubting them right sir I'm doubting my
[2:02:17] doubts now I'm believing God's word here
[2:02:20] I come Satan yes sir he said something
[2:02:22] is going to take place every time sure
[2:02:25] it
[2:02:26] will amen I I was reading um a little
[2:02:30] excerpt from uh Dwight Moody DL Moody
[2:02:33] and um he he had made a statement that
[2:02:37] um it says if you would
[2:02:38] believe you must crucify the
[2:02:41] question
[2:02:45] [Music]
[2:02:48] how if you would believe how many says
[2:02:51] there are believer Bel
[2:02:52] ver I'm not trying to play a trick on
[2:02:55] you if you're not a Believer don't put
[2:02:57] your hand up but if you are a
[2:03:00] Believer you must crucify the question
[2:03:05] how but see Satan wants you to try to
[2:03:08] reason it out and figure it out and I
[2:03:11] need to know how God is going to perform
[2:03:14] how God is going to bring his promise to
[2:03:17] completion it's not my place to find out
[2:03:21] how God is going to do anything his ways
[2:03:25] are Beyond finding
[2:03:29] out his ways are so far above my
[2:03:33] ways my finite mind could never
[2:03:37] comprehend the smallest amount of his
[2:03:41] mind all I can do is trust his word but
[2:03:44] I have to crucify the question how and I
[2:03:48] would add to it you got to crucify the
[2:03:50] question when
[2:03:55] it it it seems like it would apply that
[2:03:57] I've got to I I need to put all of the
[2:03:59] questions aside if I'm truly going to
[2:04:03] believe if I'm going to believe his word
[2:04:06] and I'm going to put my faith completely
[2:04:09] in him I need to lay all of the
[2:04:12] questions aside Hallelujah again that
[2:04:15] doesn't mean that you can't that we
[2:04:17] can't come to God and and say you know
[2:04:20] Lord could you show me me could could
[2:04:22] you reveal to me maybe why I'm I'm I'm
[2:04:25] going through the the battle I'm going
[2:04:27] to and I believe at times he chooses to
[2:04:30] to make that known to us and other times
[2:04:33] he chooses to hold that back that's
[2:04:35] right but I believe if he feels that
[2:04:37] it's in your best
[2:04:39] interest then he's going he's not going
[2:04:41] to withhold anything just like a a a
[2:04:44] your a natural father is not going to
[2:04:46] withhold any good thing from his
[2:04:49] son and he's so much greater than our
[2:04:52] natural father Yes amen yes amen so he's
[2:04:55] not going to withhold any good thing
[2:04:58] from you so I would say if it's
[2:05:00] something that's good it's something
[2:05:01] that's going to be encouraging it's
[2:05:02] something that's going to help you then
[2:05:04] yeah he might
[2:05:05] choose to reveal that to you or he may
[2:05:09] choose to withhold
[2:05:10] it again he's Sovereign we have to trust
[2:05:15] in a sovereign God we have to we have to
[2:05:18] accept that we that we know that he said
[2:05:21] all things work together for the good of
[2:05:23] them that love
[2:05:25] God we may not know how we I look at
[2:05:28] some things and I'm like exactly how is
[2:05:30] that going to work for my good and he
[2:05:33] says just be
[2:05:35] patient just stay with me a little while
[2:05:37] and and you'll see just believe and
[2:05:40] watch what he
[2:05:43] does in
[2:05:47] um You didn't tell me what time I
[2:05:49] started
[2:05:56] see you get you get here and you get in
[2:05:57] his spirit and you you um you just I I
[2:06:01] love being in his in his presence um how
[2:06:04] how many would would agree with me that
[2:06:07] unbelief can bring
[2:06:11] death
[2:06:13] unbelief and many times our unbelief is
[2:06:17] a strong
[2:06:18] barrier that stands in front of us
[2:06:22] and a fulfillment of a
[2:06:25] promise Satan wants to fill your mind
[2:06:28] with all types of things that would that
[2:06:31] would feed the unbelief that would feed
[2:06:33] the doubt and if we're not careful it
[2:06:36] would bring death to you there there was
[2:06:38] a story in 2 Kings 7 and for the sake of
[2:06:41] time I'm not going to read that entire
[2:06:43] um chapter um there's a lot of good
[2:06:45] things in there um but it was talking
[2:06:49] about um there was a prophecy that that
[2:06:52] went forth uh from Elisha and he was
[2:06:55] saying you tomorrow about this time
[2:06:57] shall a measure of fine flower be sold
[2:06:59] for a shekele two measures of barley for
[2:07:02] a shekele in the gate of Samaria and um
[2:07:05] so there was an individual that was that
[2:07:07] was told to go and speak to them he was
[2:07:10] chosen um by the hand of the king um his
[2:07:14] hand the king leaned and answer the man
[2:07:16] of God and um so he this person kind of
[2:07:20] whenever he heard this prophecy he's
[2:07:22] like
[2:07:24] um ain't going to
[2:07:26] happen again I'm paraphrasing I'm
[2:07:29] putting put in in my lingo he's like how
[2:07:33] how in the world I I mean for that to
[2:07:36] happen I mean the skies are literally
[2:07:39] going to have to just open up and I'm
[2:07:42] going to watch this stuff fall out of
[2:07:44] the Skies I mean that's the only way
[2:07:46] that that could ever happen I mean
[2:07:48] attitude that was the attitude that he
[2:07:50] had many times when a promise is given
[2:07:53] to us right it seems so
[2:07:57] outstanding that we kind of fall into
[2:07:59] that
[2:08:00] category I'll believe it when I see pigs
[2:08:02] fly yeah you know I I'll see I I'll see
[2:08:07] it I believe it when I when I see
[2:08:10] literal Heavens split open and Mana fall
[2:08:15] down well see you you you go through
[2:08:19] that 2 Kings 7 and and you also it it it
[2:08:22] kind of adds in a little story inside
[2:08:26] there you have that prophecy being said
[2:08:28] and then all of a sudden it just cuts
[2:08:29] over and starts talking about these
[2:08:34] lepers and you know in my mind first
[2:08:36] whenever you start reading you're like I
[2:08:38] what happened to the rest of that story
[2:08:39] there I'm where's Paul Harvey I'd like
[2:08:41] for him to tell me the rest of the story
[2:08:43] I mean why did you what what was the
[2:08:45] purpose of just this little insert of
[2:08:48] these lepers well it was because of the
[2:08:51] lepers uhhuh and the trust and the
[2:08:54] belief that they had yes sir is what
[2:08:57] brought to
[2:08:59] pass having all the spoils that's right
[2:09:02] of the city that they came in and had
[2:09:04] all of this excess that's right and
[2:09:06] because of their
[2:09:08] faith and they're like you if we stay
[2:09:10] here we're going to die Hallelujah if we
[2:09:13] go in there might die but God was taking
[2:09:17] all these little things seemingly
[2:09:19] nowhere near connected
[2:09:21] [Music]
[2:09:22] CU I mean if you'd have stood there
[2:09:24] while it was going on he'd been like I
[2:09:26] don't I don't see the connection here
[2:09:27] well but he used them and in their faith
[2:09:30] and their belief that brought all of
[2:09:33] this excess to them to the to the city
[2:09:35] and then they were literally selling it
[2:09:38] just like Elisha said in the in the
[2:09:40] prophecy and the one who is doubting it
[2:09:43] who is had been placed there to watch
[2:09:45] over it and he was
[2:09:48] trampled by all the people coming in
[2:09:51] yeah to receive the Bounty of
[2:09:53] blessing you will see it and he saw it
[2:09:57] but he was not going to partake of
[2:09:59] it and his
[2:10:02] unbelief cost him
[2:10:05] literally cost him his
[2:10:07] life because of not taking what the man
[2:10:12] of God told him right and accepting it
[2:10:15] as truth amen
[2:10:18] amen it
[2:10:20] it it means something whenever your
[2:10:22] pastor stands up here and saysi have a
[2:10:24] word from the Lord to
[2:10:29] you it's just not frivolous words coming
[2:10:31] off of his mouth it it's not to make
[2:10:33] something some some pretty statement but
[2:10:36] when he stands here he says the word of
[2:10:38] through the word of the Lord this is
[2:10:40] what he has given to me for given to you
[2:10:43] through
[2:10:44] me brother Steve said at the at the
[2:10:46] beginning uh Tuesday evening he said a
[2:10:50] word had been given to to him how many
[2:10:53] remembers the word strive yes
[2:10:59] strive can I show you how that ties in
[2:11:02] with my break through the
[2:11:05] barriers how many
[2:11:06] [Music]
[2:11:08] knows how many and I'm I'm not sure
[2:11:11] where I'm at with my notes I'm probably
[2:11:13] just going to close them up how many
[2:11:16] knows what year the sound barrier was
[2:11:20] broken
[2:11:23] anybody have an idea of when the sound
[2:11:25] barrier was broken anybody know what the
[2:11:28] the speed is for to break the sound
[2:11:31] barrier about 76 some places say 761
[2:11:36] some places say 767 somewh around 767
[2:11:39] miles per hour to break the sound
[2:11:44] barrier so anybody any guesses on what
[2:11:47] year it was we we achieved that
[2:11:56] 1947 I I I I love things when they when
[2:12:00] they tie
[2:12:01] together what what is what's one of the
[2:12:03] first things that brother brandham
[2:12:05] says in faith is a substance in
[2:12:09] 1947 we have these new
[2:12:11] gadgets what is he talking about a
[2:12:15] recording the sound barrier was being
[2:12:19] broken on
[2:12:21] both naturally yeah and
[2:12:24] spiritually happening in the same year
[2:12:28] I'm sorry I don't find that as a
[2:12:31] coincidence maybe it was I just don't
[2:12:33] see it that way I believe God chose to
[2:12:36] allow that to happen Hallelujah that
[2:12:39] God's voice could be put on a recording
[2:12:41] Hallelujah the same year that we achieve
[2:12:45] breaking this natural sound barrier he
[2:12:48] broke a barrier that his voice because
[2:12:51] the scripture says in the days of the
[2:12:54] voice right I never got to meet
[2:12:59] him I never got to meet him in person
[2:13:01] I'm not old enough to have been able to
[2:13:04] meet
[2:13:05] him but I've heard a
[2:13:07] voice and I'm so thankful that there was
[2:13:11] a voice that was given and it it just so
[2:13:14] happened in my opinion it broke a sound
[2:13:16] barrier and I believe it it any anyway
[2:13:22] you can either believe it you don't have
[2:13:23] to believe it I believe it amen I
[2:13:26] believe it I believe that um in in um I
[2:13:31] was speaking about Ephesians um earlier
[2:13:32] Ephesians chapter 6:1 17 says take the
[2:13:35] helmet of
[2:13:37] salvation we were talking about the
[2:13:38] weapons of our Warfare they're not
[2:13:40] carnal that take the helmet of salvation
[2:13:42] the sword of the spirit which is
[2:13:45] the it's the
[2:13:48] Rama I know y'all y' y'all are
[2:13:51] y'all are a church that studies these
[2:13:54] things out because I I I I know brother
[2:13:56] Steve I know brother Wesley and they
[2:13:57] they bring these things out to you it's
[2:13:59] not the
[2:14:00] logos whenever it says the word that it
[2:14:03] was the Rama of God it was a spoken word
[2:14:07] so it it requires us to speak we we have
[2:14:12] to break that sound barrier we have to
[2:14:14] break it yourself and whenever you can
[2:14:17] speak his
[2:14:19] word it breaks every
[2:14:23] F his word amen will
[2:14:27] break every feder every shackle
[2:14:30] Hallelujah Every Chain everything that
[2:14:33] would put bondage on you his word when
[2:14:37] it's
[2:14:38] spoken it breaks it it cannot stand in
[2:14:42] the presence of the spoken word of
[2:14:47] godall and I would I would I mean I
[2:14:49] would say there there's a there's a a
[2:14:52] term that's called breakthrough you know
[2:14:55] we it's a it's a phrasal verb um which
[2:14:57] means break through a barrier and you
[2:15:00] succeed
[2:15:01] by
[2:15:03] passively going through
[2:15:06] it
[2:15:09] oh you didn't you didn't that doesn't
[2:15:11] ring true does it no you you succeed by
[2:15:17] forcing by Push by force in go back to
[2:15:22] what your pastor told you this morning
[2:15:25] in the little note that he sent out it's
[2:15:28] not it's not the time to set
[2:15:32] back we cannot stop at this at this
[2:15:36] point that we're in see speaking about
[2:15:39] the sound
[2:15:41] barrier whenever you you you look at a
[2:15:43] plane and and and brother Brown talks
[2:15:46] about this and I'm I'm probably just
[2:15:47] going to paraphrase again if that's all
[2:15:49] right um if you want to see what he said
[2:15:52] about it I've got it in my notes um I'll
[2:15:55] happily let you let you see it brother
[2:15:57] Brown talks about um he's describing
[2:16:01] when a plane is getting close to that
[2:16:04] sound
[2:16:05] barrier and I and I I read about it and
[2:16:08] I looked at the history on it and and
[2:16:10] how many different planes was completely
[2:16:12] torn
[2:16:13] apart and it broke the plane apart
[2:16:16] because it was not
[2:16:18] designed well enough to go beyond the
[2:16:22] barrier of sound because the sound waves
[2:16:25] become
[2:16:27] compressed at the closer you get to 760
[2:16:30] milph as they're approaching that the
[2:16:33] sound waves get so compressed that it
[2:16:37] literally makes the the the vessel
[2:16:40] continually shake and tremble and if
[2:16:44] it's not designed properly it will fall
[2:16:48] apart bolts will start flying out of it
[2:16:51] the wings will start breaking off of it
[2:16:55] but see we have been taught that we are
[2:16:57] a specially built
[2:17:00] Bird right amen we're an
[2:17:04] eagle we have been
[2:17:06] designed to withstand all of the
[2:17:10] pressures that's trying to come at you
[2:17:13] don't sell yourself short don't accept
[2:17:16] say well I you know I I'm going to be
[2:17:18] I'm I'm okay to be a chicken or I'm I'm
[2:17:21] okay to be a Hulk or I'm okay to be a a
[2:17:23] buzzard or a crow no if you are born an
[2:17:26] eagle you are an
[2:17:28] eagle step into your
[2:17:31] position with the authority that you
[2:17:34] have that he has given in your life and
[2:17:37] you can break through H but you have to
[2:17:41] force through it right it can't be a
[2:17:45] passive
[2:17:46] thing even the the planes that are
[2:17:49] designed yeah to to achieve it uhhuh
[2:17:52] feel that same pressure
[2:17:55] sir the pressure is still going to be
[2:17:58] there it's just the nature of trying to
[2:18:01] break through it but they still feel a
[2:18:05] shape they still feel a a tremble of the
[2:18:08] pressure but they have the ability they
[2:18:11] have the strength they have the power to
[2:18:13] break through it brother Brown said
[2:18:16] whenever you whenever you break when you
[2:18:17] finally break through that sound barer
[2:18:19] he said you got 50 mil mil of Elbow
[2:18:23] Room Hallelujah you feel a freedom
[2:18:26] freedom he says it's unlimited speed
[2:18:29] then whenever you break through he's he
[2:18:32] was talking about the natural
[2:18:34] planes I I don't I don't know his full
[2:18:37] understanding of of planes and I don't
[2:18:39] know about the unlimited speed and all
[2:18:40] that but I know I can take it
[2:18:42] spiritually
[2:18:43] speaking whenever we can break through
[2:18:46] the barrier that's standing between us
[2:18:49] and his presence and the thing is you
[2:18:52] don't have to break it tell because he
[2:18:55] said I've already
[2:18:57] torn that Veil apart so literally all
[2:19:01] that is standing between you and
[2:19:04] him is this right
[2:19:06] here there is no literal barricade there
[2:19:11] is no literal Wall of Separation that
[2:19:15] stands between you and his presence
[2:19:18] there is no Veil that is hiding him from
[2:19:22] you
[2:19:23] now he took care of that he ripped it
[2:19:27] apart we ought to be thankful that he
[2:19:32] did he tore that apart to make himself
[2:19:36] available and he calls to you and
[2:19:38] invites you to come in and then your
[2:19:41] mind gets in the
[2:19:43] way your mind keeps you out of the
[2:19:48] presence of God
[2:19:50] because we continually listen to the
[2:19:54] little things that Satan wants to tell
[2:19:57] you and he says you're not
[2:20:00] worthy to be in his
[2:20:03] presence you know it's it's good for
[2:20:05] those other people and and you know you
[2:20:08] just need to you need to watch and and
[2:20:10] just observe and and see how God is
[2:20:13] blessing the other people and and and
[2:20:15] that's that's good for them and he can
[2:20:17] bless them but he can't bless you
[2:20:20] because
[2:20:21] of this in your life and that happened
[2:20:23] in your life and this was in your past
[2:20:26] if you had placed it under the
[2:20:28] blood
[2:20:30] never it exactly it never happened in
[2:20:34] the first
[2:20:37] place God it does not simply cover it
[2:20:42] hallelujah hallelujah it don't just
[2:20:45] cover your sins not in
[2:20:48] that meaning of the word cover
[2:20:50] [Music]
[2:20:52] it
[2:20:53] completely
[2:20:56] annihilated you you were you were
[2:20:58] speaking on I think just a week or so
[2:21:00] ago you're speaking on atonement at
[2:21:05] onement his blood completely
[2:21:10] annihilated when when you say I never
[2:21:12] did it in the first place what is the
[2:21:15] first place yeah it's the mind of God
[2:21:20] right
[2:21:21] before the foundation of the world yes
[2:21:25] sir I was with him I was in his mind sir
[2:21:30] before the foundation of the world and
[2:21:32] while I was in his mind guess what there
[2:21:34] was no
[2:21:36] sin there was no
[2:21:38] sin in
[2:21:41] him now in this flesh body that he has
[2:21:43] allowed me to come and dwell in for a
[2:21:45] period of time there is sin that's the
[2:21:49] nature of this flesh but in the
[2:21:52] beginning it was not so that's
[2:21:55] right it was not so and I continually
[2:21:57] remind Satan every single day of where
[2:22:01] my beginning is that's right yes and I
[2:22:04] can remind it where my ending is going
[2:22:06] to be cuz I came from
[2:22:11] God and I'm going back to
[2:22:14] God if you were ever with
[2:22:17] him the only way you can be redeemed
[2:22:21] is you have to have been with him in the
[2:22:23] first place you have to be his and if
[2:22:27] you are his then you are his now and you
[2:22:29] will always be
[2:22:34] his oh let's find something else to I
[2:22:38] talked about
[2:22:39] 1947 there's another there's another
[2:22:41] thing and I don't know if I can find it
[2:22:43] I had a
[2:22:45] um how many knows there was a statement
[2:22:49] that was made
[2:22:53] oh I really want to share this with
[2:22:56] you
[2:23:01] good anybody ever heard of a of a phrase
[2:23:05] that says the only thing we have to
[2:23:10] fear who said
[2:23:15] that Franklin D
[2:23:18] Roosevelt anybody know when he said only
[2:23:22] thing we have to fear is fear
[2:23:25] itself
[2:23:29] 1933 1933 was this country was deep in
[2:23:34] depression
[2:23:36] 1933 and it was at his inaugural
[2:23:39] address that Franklin D Roosevelt stood
[2:23:42] before the people and and I you know
[2:23:45] they they'll use that little excerpt of
[2:23:48] just the only thing we have to fear is
[2:23:49] fear itself and they stop it there well
[2:23:52] I'd like to read it in the context just
[2:23:54] a little bit before and a little bit
[2:23:55] after he says so first of all let me
[2:23:58] assert my firm belief that the only
[2:24:01] thing we have to fear is fear itself he
[2:24:06] didn't stop there he describes that fear
[2:24:10] nameless
[2:24:12] unreasoning unjustified
[2:24:14] Terror which paralyzes needed efforts to
[2:24:19] convert
[2:24:21] Retreat into
[2:24:25] advance and I thought that was pretty
[2:24:29] astounding I I I like I I love reading
[2:24:32] things like that and just taking it and
[2:24:34] then applying it to my spiritual life
[2:24:37] because that's exactly what fear
[2:24:40] does it becomes unjustified Terror that
[2:24:45] literally not figuratively but literally
[2:24:49] will paraliz
[2:24:52] people you ever you ever met i' I've met
[2:24:55] people that become completely
[2:24:58] paralyzed they have they have no way to
[2:25:01] control thems the fear gets so strong in
[2:25:05] their mind again it's only in their mind
[2:25:09] it's not literal it's not something
[2:25:11] that's actually people um I don't know
[2:25:13] the the the word for it off the top of
[2:25:15] my head it's a type of phobia um where
[2:25:18] somebody they they're they always think
[2:25:20] that that something is wrong with them
[2:25:23] um hypochondriac thank you um I could I
[2:25:27] could see it but I couldn't think of it
[2:25:29] exactly but there are people that are
[2:25:31] that way especially they'll they'll see
[2:25:34] somebody else going through a a a trial
[2:25:36] or going through a struggle and
[2:25:38] automatically they start
[2:25:40] associating oh you know my my my back's
[2:25:44] hurting me too
[2:25:51] is that
[2:25:55] the okay um let me think of something
[2:25:57] else you hear somebody say they got a
[2:25:59] headache man my you know what my head's
[2:26:02] really been hurting me all day long I
[2:26:04] didn't sleep good last night just been a
[2:26:08] I wonder if it's a
[2:26:10] migraine and then they take it a fur a
[2:26:13] step further you know what I was reading
[2:26:15] the other
[2:26:16] day and this other friend of mine they
[2:26:19] thought that they had a
[2:26:20] tumor and that was what was causing them
[2:26:23] to have
[2:26:24] headaches you know what I might have a
[2:26:29] tumor it's unjustified
[2:26:33] Terror and I I'm I'm making you say
[2:26:36] you're making light of it I am trying to
[2:26:38] make light of it because but it's truly
[2:26:40] a
[2:26:41] serious condition that people allow
[2:26:44] themselves to continually stay in and it
[2:26:47] becomes a cycle of their life and just
[2:26:50] just because somebody else is having
[2:26:52] this problem Satan wants to
[2:26:55] say you know what you you've been
[2:26:58] feeling those same
[2:27:00] pains you you've been feeling that same
[2:27:03] thing oh I bet you're dealing with the
[2:27:05] same thing they've got
[2:27:08] no no don't accept that
[2:27:13] Terror whenever those things take a hold
[2:27:15] of you guess what it it paralyzes you to
[2:27:18] the point that you can't lift
[2:27:21] hands and start giving praise like we
[2:27:24] said earlier
[2:27:26] praise is our warfare that's how we can
[2:27:29] that's how we overcome
[2:27:31] things but whenever you become paralyzed
[2:27:34] now now your hands are kept by your side
[2:27:37] right people get so paralyzed through
[2:27:39] fear that it places
[2:27:41] Shackles on their
[2:27:43] feet and then they're unable to get up
[2:27:47] and get out of the house and come to the
[2:27:48] house of God and be in his presence
[2:27:51] where God can come down and help you
[2:27:54] break
[2:27:56] through come on because of
[2:28:02] fear it literally will paralyze you to
[2:28:06] and if you if you give into that and you
[2:28:08] continue to yield to that and you
[2:28:11] continue to talk
[2:28:13] about my this and my that and my
[2:28:16] whatever I don't first off I don't like
[2:28:19] to use
[2:28:22] my that's
[2:28:25] right ain't
[2:28:29] yours don't
[2:28:34] don't it ain't your
[2:28:36] cancer it ain't your TB it ain't your
[2:28:42] diabetes it ain't yours right you may be
[2:28:45] fighting against some of those things
[2:28:47] you may be you may be overcoming the
[2:28:50] those things but don't don't claim it
[2:28:52] and don't just go through and say oh man
[2:28:56] my my my you know my my migraines come
[2:29:00] on my my stomach problem my my this my
[2:29:05] that stop with the
[2:29:07] m tonight when you leave from tonight go
[2:29:11] forth from tonight and say you know what
[2:29:13] that's not
[2:29:15] mine that's something that Satan's
[2:29:17] trying to put on me and he's trying to
[2:29:19] make me sign for that box of
[2:29:20] rattlesnakes but I'm not signing for it
[2:29:23] I'm not receiving it I'm putting it
[2:29:26] right back to him and say I'm
[2:29:29] overcoming it it it matters the way we
[2:29:32] speak about things sure does power of
[2:29:36] life and death lies where in the tongue
[2:29:40] so either we choose to speak
[2:29:43] life or we choose to speak
[2:29:46] death we have to make that choice
[2:29:51] we have to make the choice that I'm not
[2:29:55] going to accept those things anymore
[2:29:59] right you know you talking about um our
[2:30:02] praise is a
[2:30:05] weapon
[2:30:09] yes you know the story of Paul and Silas
[2:30:13] sure whenever they were in in jail they
[2:30:15] were in prison it wasn't a nice prison
[2:30:19] like what we have
[2:30:21] it was a
[2:30:22] cell a stone area that's that's cut out
[2:30:26] and they place them back in these areas
[2:30:27] it's
[2:30:29] dark and they put them back in there and
[2:30:33] Paul and Silas sitting there literally
[2:30:36] in shackles and
[2:30:40] chains they couldn't move if they wanted
[2:30:44] to but they chose to take that
[2:30:48] opportunity to
[2:30:50] praise a sovereign
[2:30:54] God that's right and their
[2:30:58] praise did not only free
[2:31:03] them sometimes people come into church
[2:31:07] and they're having a difficult time
[2:31:08] breaking through
[2:31:11] amen they they have a a desire to
[2:31:14] breakthrough but maybe something has
[2:31:17] oppressed them to a point that they
[2:31:19] can't
[2:31:20] absolutely guess what your
[2:31:24] praise just like Paul and silas's praise
[2:31:28] that delivered all the rest of them that
[2:31:30] were there in the prison with them those
[2:31:33] other people doesn't say that they were
[2:31:35] worshiping with them doesn't even tell
[2:31:37] me that I don't know if they entered in
[2:31:39] at all who knows they might have been
[2:31:41] telling them would you guys just
[2:31:43] hush they they might have been saying
[2:31:45] y'all way too loud y'all are too y
[2:31:50] y'all are too
[2:31:51] rambunctious you need to quieten down
[2:31:54] I'm already I'm having I'm stuck in this
[2:31:57] hole I really didn't want to hear what
[2:31:59] you got to say I didn't want to hear you
[2:32:01] when you was on the outside I don't want
[2:32:03] to hear you now when you're in
[2:32:04] here but it was their praise that
[2:32:09] delivered all of
[2:32:11] them and it caused a
[2:32:15] Deliverance to the Jailer hallu he was
[2:32:20] present but it it didn't even stop at
[2:32:22] just those that was
[2:32:24] present it carried on their
[2:32:28] praise their praise is what delivered
[2:32:32] him and his
[2:32:35] house what it's amazing because he he
[2:32:38] comes in and he calls the the the Jailer
[2:32:41] Hears A
[2:32:42] noise he here here's here's a a voice
[2:32:46] and he calls for a light he hears this
[2:32:49] racket here's a noise so a noise is is
[2:32:52] presented and he calls for a light what
[2:32:55] do we what do we understand is light
[2:32:57] light is is understanding is revelation
[2:32:59] he calls for a light and then when that
[2:33:02] Revelation that light came to him it not
[2:33:05] only brought him
[2:33:07] freedom but it brought his entire family
[2:33:10] freedom because he listened to what was
[2:33:14] being said by Paul and Silas and he
[2:33:17] heeded the words that they said said to
[2:33:20] him and their praise took him completely
[2:33:25] to a different
[2:33:27] level it gave it gave him in his home
[2:33:31] salvation the Lord because he called for
[2:33:34] a life right he wanted that something
[2:33:38] needed to be shown in front of him I
[2:33:40] need to see what's going on
[2:33:43] here and they they gave him a whole lot
[2:33:46] more light than he ever thought that he
[2:33:48] was going to receive they gave gave him
[2:33:51] his light they gave him the light of the
[2:33:53] world they gave him Jesus Christ that
[2:33:57] came in and saved him and his family
[2:34:02] am we can and we will overcome fear we
[2:34:06] can and we will overcome worry we will
[2:34:09] overcome anxiety today can be your time
[2:34:14] for a breakthrough today is the time
[2:34:17] that you can move Beyond beond the
[2:34:21] barriers and maybe you'll sit here
[2:34:23] tonight and and as we worship in a in a
[2:34:26] few minutes as you
[2:34:27] worship don't you don't even have to pay
[2:34:30] attention to the other people that are
[2:34:31] around you but keep in mind my level of
[2:34:36] worship could help bring somebody else
[2:34:39] out of the
[2:34:41] prison of their
[2:34:44] mind so if I
[2:34:46] knew that my worship thank you thank
[2:34:51] just take a a moment for a
[2:34:53] second if I know based on scriptural
[2:34:58] examples that my level of
[2:35:01] worship could assist someone into
[2:35:05] eternal
[2:35:07] life why would I want to sit down on
[2:35:13] God because the inverse that could be
[2:35:16] then said if I don't give him all and I
[2:35:21] failed to worship him I could then be
[2:35:24] preventing
[2:35:26] somebody from Gaining that freedom that
[2:35:29] they
[2:35:31] need so I want to be
[2:35:35] free but not only do I want to be free I
[2:35:38] want everybody around me to be
[2:35:41] free and that's that's what I I so love
[2:35:44] when I when I watch the worship team
[2:35:46] here and then I I see that it goes from
[2:35:49] from them through you yeah that is not
[2:35:54] it's not left up just to brother
[2:35:56] Benjamin standing up here or those the
[2:35:58] maybe somebody else that would stand
[2:35:59] here and take that position it's not
[2:36:01] just left up to them that you are
[2:36:03] picking up that Banner as well and
[2:36:06] you're saying God you can use me
[2:36:09] too I'm going to give you all of my
[2:36:12] praise and I'm going to watch you
[2:36:14] deliver somebody through my
[2:36:18] praise it's it's great that that that
[2:36:21] the man of God can stand here the pastor
[2:36:23] can stand here and and through him and
[2:36:25] through the Deliverance of the word that
[2:36:27] Deliverance can come but the Deliverance
[2:36:29] can come and will come through you as
[2:36:33] well it's when the word Goes Forth and
[2:36:37] our praise enters into him it draws us
[2:36:41] into that presence and it can assist
[2:36:44] somebody around you to break through the
[2:36:48] barrier that is in their
[2:36:51] way if I knew that that I that there was
[2:36:54] somebody stuck in behind a wall and I
[2:36:57] heard them crying out and crying out and
[2:37:00] crying out and I wouldn't take the time
[2:37:02] to go over to that wall and do my best
[2:37:05] to break through the wall for them what
[2:37:09] good of a personel
[2:37:12] I last last night we got
[2:37:15] home call it home sister Sharon's home
[2:37:19] that's what we tell tell Liam we're
[2:37:21] going home and um so we we got we got to
[2:37:24] the house last night and we get out of
[2:37:26] the the car and and I didn't turn turn
[2:37:30] The the lights on in the in the um the
[2:37:33] garage there so I I had because the
[2:37:36] lights were on in the car and as we shut
[2:37:38] everything down it was getting dark and
[2:37:39] and there was a light in the hallway
[2:37:41] that we could see how to how to get
[2:37:43] through so I didn't take the time to
[2:37:44] turn all the bright lights
[2:37:46] on and we get in in the house
[2:37:50] and I'm I'm walking through the the the
[2:37:52] kitchen and Heather says where's
[2:37:54] Liam I said we got him out I mean he
[2:37:58] followed you didn't he and she
[2:38:00] said I didn't I didn't see him come in
[2:38:04] so I'm asking the kids where where's
[2:38:05] Liam I haven't seen him haven't seen
[2:38:08] him so in a frantic
[2:38:11] Panic I'm headed back toward the garage
[2:38:14] C I knew that all the lights were turned
[2:38:17] off and the door was closed closed and
[2:38:22] locked and as I was coming down the
[2:38:25] hallway I Heard a Voice saying
[2:38:30] Daddy
[2:38:32] Daddy
[2:38:34] Dad that pulls on
[2:38:36] you and I'm I'm I'm yelling his name out
[2:38:40] I'm I'm I'm on my way I'm coming I'm
[2:38:42] you're okay Daddy's right here and I go
[2:38:45] and I open the door and he's just
[2:38:46] standing there like
[2:38:50] you know he didn't know what to do
[2:38:52] because he was standing in the
[2:38:56] dark and there's so many
[2:38:59] people but I call the law it wasn't it
[2:39:03] was an accident and I wouldn't have been
[2:39:06] able to share it in my message tonight
[2:39:08] if it hadn't have
[2:39:17] happened but when we cry out to
[2:39:29] he does not hesitate to
[2:39:36] answer I don't care if it's been 10
[2:39:38] years since you called out to
[2:39:44] him when you say father
[2:39:51] guess what he is right
[2:39:54] there right there to respond to
[2:39:58] you and I think many
[2:40:00] times we we just get we get lacad isical
[2:40:04] yes sir we get complacent in the life
[2:40:06] that we live and we don't take time to
[2:40:10] recognize number one Lord I'm standing
[2:40:13] in a dark
[2:40:15] [Music]
[2:40:16] place I don't know
[2:40:19] how to get out of this
[2:40:22] place and some people just decide just
[2:40:24] to stay there and take up a bod in a
[2:40:27] dark place of their life and they just
[2:40:31] stay there and they never take time to
[2:40:35] Simply call out oh
[2:40:38] Jesus this the thing is is he's just
[2:40:43] waiting when you call out to
[2:40:46] him he will respond
[2:40:49] amen doesn't matter I was only going out
[2:40:52] of the room for about two and a half
[2:40:54] minutes right but he was already
[2:40:57] calling wanting to know where daddy
[2:41:01] was because he trusted that if he kept
[2:41:04] calling my
[2:41:05] name that I was going to hear it and I
[2:41:08] was going to
[2:41:11] respond it may have been more than two
[2:41:13] and a half minutes for
[2:41:15] you it may have been more than two and a
[2:41:18] half years for you
[2:41:21] there may there there we may be sitting
[2:41:24] here tonight with with people that have
[2:41:26] have never cried out to
[2:41:30] him but all it takes is you turn to
[2:41:34] him and you
[2:41:36] call to our heavenly
[2:41:39] father and he is going to break
[2:41:42] down every wall that standed between you
[2:41:46] and him
[2:41:49] and he's going to make his way to you
[2:41:52] and receive you back to
[2:41:55] him he has given you the authority he's
[2:41:59] given you
[2:42:01] the the tools necessary to achieve a
[2:42:07] breakthrough it's in his word we have to
[2:42:10] place it we heard it again last night we
[2:42:12] have to place it within our own mouth
[2:42:15] amen and we have to speak thus sayith
[2:42:18] the Lord
[2:42:20] Lord whenever you speak what is in this
[2:42:24] holy word you are speaking thus sayeth
[2:42:29] the Lord I don't question any of it I
[2:42:33] don't understand all of it but I don't
[2:42:36] question it I know that his word is
[2:42:39] forever true it is forever settled in
[2:42:43] heaven Hallelujah there is a there
[2:42:46] there's a little statement that I want
[2:42:48] to I want to add in here and and and
[2:42:50] close the service um tonight um excuse
[2:42:56] me as I as I find it um oh forgive me I
[2:43:02] I'm so out of out of notes that
[2:43:08] uh with the musicians come this
[2:43:13] evening
[2:43:17] 1959 in the message Abraham's seed you
[2:43:21] have that
[2:43:23] one this this is a very sticky
[2:43:28] statement when a child of
[2:43:30] God here it is get
[2:43:33] it when a child of God begins to break
[2:43:36] through that Dark Mist of
[2:43:39] unbelief and gets a hold of God's
[2:43:42] promise and begins to draw from it you
[2:43:45] have to go back in that message he's
[2:43:47] talking about drawing from Emanuel he's
[2:43:49] the he's talking about I'm sorry drawing
[2:43:52] um from elhi um he he's so begins to
[2:43:56] draw from it draw from it
[2:44:04] it how many of us do
[2:44:08] that it shuts up about its
[2:44:13] sickness
[2:44:16] Hallelujah prophet of God said just shut
[2:44:18] up about
[2:44:20] it if you have given it over to
[2:44:24] God you have accepted that he's given
[2:44:26] you a promise and there's a promise in
[2:44:28] his
[2:44:29] word then why do you keep talking about
[2:44:33] it why do you want to keep bringing it
[2:44:36] up in your
[2:44:38] conversation in in in Dwayne Jackson's
[2:44:41] term he said just shut up about it
[2:44:43] enough's enough if you're going to take
[2:44:46] it to God and you're going to draw from
[2:44:48] him and you're going to trust him then
[2:44:51] let it go let it go shut up about your
[2:44:55] sicknesses don't continually bring it up
[2:44:58] again don't get on the phone and keep
[2:45:02] sharing about I'm dealing with this and
[2:45:05] I'm dealing with that and I'm dealing
[2:45:06] with the other I don't need to hear that
[2:45:09] I don't want to hear
[2:45:13] that Prophet
[2:45:15] said if you're going to draw from it
[2:45:17] uhuh then shut up about the
[2:45:21] sickness
[2:45:24] says it begins to draw from it it
[2:45:27] satisfied glory to he says they don't
[2:45:29] sell well my my hand's no different in
[2:45:32] other
[2:45:32] words I prayed for my hand but my hand's
[2:45:36] no
[2:45:38] different is don't even look at the hand
[2:45:42] anymore why it's looking at where its
[2:45:46] strengths coming from and my
[2:45:50] strength Cometh From The
[2:45:54] Lord so either either we trust in him or
[2:45:59] we
[2:46:00] don't either we leave it with
[2:46:04] him or we
[2:46:07] don't either we say God is taking care
[2:46:10] of me and I'm going to shut up about it
[2:46:13] from now on I'm not going to continually
[2:46:15] bring it up and keep talking about it
[2:46:17] and just rehearsing the problem that
[2:46:18] that I
[2:46:19] have because that all that does is feed
[2:46:23] doubt it feeds worry that's trth y'all
[2:46:26] y'all I don't know if I've shared it
[2:46:28] with y'all I probably
[2:46:29] have somebody might not have been here
[2:46:31] before the little phrase what
[2:46:36] if my definition of what
[2:46:39] if worry helps anxiety turn into
[2:46:46] fear you sit around and you let Satan
[2:46:50] fill your mind with what if what if what
[2:46:55] if all that continually does is feed the
[2:46:59] the anxiety and takes it to the next
[2:47:02] level which then becomes fear and fear
[2:47:06] has no place within
[2:47:08] you it brings torment exactly what it
[2:47:12] does unjustified
[2:47:15] Terror that becomes paralyzing again
[2:47:18] against
[2:47:20] us you know there's a there's a word
[2:47:22] that we can
[2:47:23] speak that can break through
[2:47:28] that it's the name of
[2:47:33] Jesus you can speak his
[2:47:37] name and it will break
[2:47:40] through any any struggle any
[2:47:45] problem I'm not telling you that
[2:47:46] struggles aren't going to come that's a
[2:47:49] part of breaking through that
[2:47:52] is whenever you recognize I'm going
[2:47:54] through a struggle just say I'm almost
[2:47:57] to that sound barrier I must be getting
[2:48:00] closer to that sound barrier because it
[2:48:03] keeps shaking and it keeps shaking me
[2:48:06] and I keep feeling the pressure and keep
[2:48:08] feeling the pressure that's not a time
[2:48:10] to
[2:48:12] stall that's not a time to say I'm going
[2:48:15] to pull back and I'm going to divert my
[2:48:17] cores that's the time that you say Satan
[2:48:20] on no matter what you throw at me on I
[2:48:23] know who I am I know the authority that
[2:48:27] has been placed Within Me by the word of
[2:48:29] God and I'm going to continue to push my
[2:48:33] way past the barrier that he wants to
[2:48:36] put in front of me and if all I can do
[2:48:40] is say the name of
[2:48:44] Jesus sometimes you're in a place
[2:48:46] nothing else can come to you and all all
[2:48:48] you have the strength to do is call out
[2:48:51] his
[2:48:53] name that's a truth you call it out call
[2:48:57] it out and you continually to call his
[2:49:00] name because whenever you call his
[2:49:03] name he will
[2:49:06] respond he will respond can y'all y'all

[2:49:14] Jesus G I think I do it in G I know but

[3:19:24] your identification in what you've lived
[3:19:27] through let me tell you something your
[3:19:29] identification is in the word it's at
[3:19:33] Calvary it's in the blood it's not in
[3:19:36] what you've come through that does not
[3:19:39] define you your your definition comes
[3:19:42] from what God's word has said about you

[3:36:56] they'll just be in service after service
[3:36:59] after service after service after
[3:37:00] service after
[3:37:03] service it's not about some
[3:37:08] performance it's about an experience
[3:37:11] amen and if you don't think that this
[3:37:13] message teaches us to have a an
[3:37:15] experience with God yeah I don't know
[3:37:17] what T I don't know what you've been
[3:37:18] listening
[3:37:19] to every man's got to have a pillar of
[3:37:22] fire experience for himself somebody
[3:37:25] said well I know the preachers have to
[3:37:27] have a taste of the original Mana before
[3:37:29] they can get in the pool pit you better
[3:37:31] have a
[3:37:33] taste you better have a taste of the
[3:37:36] original Mana that's
[3:37:39] right because when they stored it up and
[3:37:42] tried to make some kind of I don't know
[3:37:44] what I an easier way or a fast food way
[3:37:49] or something I don't know what they were
[3:37:51] trying to do but they tried to store it
[3:37:53] up because God said this is how it
[3:37:55] should be harvested and this is how it
[3:37:57] should be consumed but they thought well
[3:38:00] we'll just gather some extras we get
[3:38:01] toward the Sabbath and we'll be ready
[3:38:04] but the Bible said it it uh breed
[3:38:11] worms I'm not going to preach but if I
[3:38:13] wanted to I I would
[3:38:16] on brother you wouldn't have to stay
[3:38:18] there's no no uh in spite despite what
[3:38:21] some people say there are no locks on
[3:38:22] the doors you go and come as you please
[3:38:24] revolving
[3:38:25] door but I want you to know it uh it's
[3:38:29] it it it had
[3:38:32] maggots it bred crawling worms and it
[3:38:36] was rotten it stank one day before it
[3:38:39] was the gift of
[3:38:43] God one day before it was the gift of
[3:38:47] God to sustain the hungry people but
[3:38:50] because they
[3:38:52] misused and abused the manner that God
[3:38:55] had sent it bred maggots you like saying
[3:38:59] that don't you brother I
[3:39:01] do because if I say that out from under
[3:39:04] the anointing I
[3:39:06] gag that that's that's how that word
[3:39:08] affects me I can see them when I say
[3:39:11] them you understand sir but that's what
[3:39:15] that's how I want you to see it I want
[3:39:17] you to see that the thing that sustains
[3:39:20] you one day if you mandle it if you
[3:39:24] misapply it if you misappropriate it it
[3:39:27] can breed worms and be rotted the next
[3:39:33] day and bring death to
[3:39:36] you God never intended it to be that way
[3:39:39] he wanted it to be a daily h a daily
[3:39:43] bread give us this is Jesus Jus praying
[3:39:46] it it ought to be a good prayer if Jesus
[3:39:48] prayed it give us this
[3:39:51] day our daily bread you're not talking
[3:39:54] about the stored up word of the message
[3:39:55] are you no no not not not not uh in
[3:39:59] general in Broad terms but I will tell
[3:40:02] you that if you start trusting in a book
[3:40:04] or a tape instead of a real
[3:40:08] Jesus I mean a knowing with him a
[3:40:11] relationship with him it'll become
[3:40:13] religion to you
[3:40:17] it'll become religion to you and you'll
[3:40:19] find yourself lukewarm and and can you
[3:40:21] imagine Jesus saying I'd rather you be
[3:40:25] frozen than
[3:40:28] religious I'd rather you be
[3:40:30] frozen I would that thou W hot or cold
[3:40:33] but the lukewarm I'll spew out of my

[3:40:38] in a lukewarm State amen you plug into
[3:40:43] him you don't have to have somebody pray
