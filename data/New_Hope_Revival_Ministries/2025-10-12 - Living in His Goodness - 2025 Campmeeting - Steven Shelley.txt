[Music] I just got a feeling when Paul and Silas [Music] were fixing to break out of jail. &gt;&gt; God was going to do it. &gt;&gt; God has done it for you. Why would we be quiet? [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; I've got something to shout about. Jesus saved me out of a life of sin. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's enough to shout about. [Music] &gt;&gt; But that wasn't the end of my story. &gt;&gt; He sent along his sanctifying power and he brought me a little bit of a little bit closer to himself and then he baptized me in the Holy Ghost. And he hasn't stopped there &gt;&gt; because he keeps pouring his Holy Ghost, his holy spirit into me over and over again. And then he gives me the revelation of his precious word. And he keeps revealing it and revealing it and revealing it. &gt;&gt; Oh, why would I not lift my voice and give him praise? I'm a part of that New Testament church that is rising up, coming into her place, her position, recognizing who she is and the authority that she's been given in the end time &gt;&gt; on the earth. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let your kingdom come &gt;&gt; and let your will be done in this earth. Not just in that dirt out there, but in this earth right here. Let your kingdom come and let your will be done in earth as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you Jesus. [Music] From glory to glory. He's changing me. I'm sorry to tell you, I have been impatient along the way. &gt;&gt; Some of you have been, too. We have thrown around words like, "I'm just going to quit." What good is that going to do? What you going to go back to? &gt;&gt; There's nothing to go back to. &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep pressing on &gt;&gt; for the prize in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Because he has placed it before my eyes. And he keeps unveiling it more and more and more as the preaching of his word is given to us. He's unveiling it more and more. That prize that awaits his people, this New Testament church. I want you to lift your hands toward our pastor, Brother Shelley. He's coming to preach the word tonight. And you can tell he's just a little bit. He He's stifled by this voice because he's a shout. He's a praiser. &gt;&gt; And his voice is a little stifled tonight. It's he's a little choked up. And I want us to ask the Lord to open up his vocal cords. Open up his voice. Anything that would hinder his voice, we want to go open and we want it gone in the name of Jesus Christ. As we pray over our pastor, our brother tonight, we speak into his life, into his vocal cords, God, as he steps behind this desk that he would be able to preach, that his voice will carry, that his voice will be able to speak the words with clarity tonight. God, use him to speak to us. Heavy presence of God over him call of fire in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We glorify you Lord. [Music] For they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mountain with wings as he goes. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. Teach me Lord. Teach me Lord to wait. Sing again. All they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as he goes. [Music] They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk. [Music] upon the Lord shall renew their strength. Mount up with wings and they shall walk and not fade. Teach me Lord. Teach me Lord to wait. Turn it up as loud as you can without squealing it. They that wait upon the Lord shall renew. They shall mount up with wings as eagles. They shall run [Music] They shall walk slipping around. Teach me Lord. Teach me Lord to wait. Give the Lord a hand clap of praise. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] The Lord is good. &gt;&gt; I said the Lord is good. &gt;&gt; I don't know how you're going to stand to listen to that. You think you can handle it for a few minutes? &gt;&gt; Be seated just a moment. &gt;&gt; I had to pull my socks up. It's been quite a while since I shouted my socks down. [Music] &gt;&gt; But I'm not ashamed. How many of you can say, "I'm not ashamed." &gt;&gt; I was there when the Holy Ghost fell, &gt;&gt; and I'm not ashamed that it fell on me. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'd rather be an oldtime Christian &gt;&gt; than anything I know. &gt;&gt; Saved and sanctified, &gt;&gt; filled with the Holy Ghost and fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ready to serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; I can't use what voice I have for all the things that I would like to say because I want to give you a message. And I want you to know you're going to need the Lord's help to be able to hear me. And if there's one thing that I can't take, it's a voice that's annoying. God. &gt;&gt; So, I think you're going to have to struggle tonight with an annoying voice. &gt;&gt; May God give you the grace to hear beyond this voice. &gt;&gt; I hope you can hear another voice. &gt;&gt; I would like to take the time to go around the room and greet everyone. Brother Gley has such a good eye for that and names and he's so good with all that. I would have to get his help to do it. But there are so many memories that are represented in this room this evening. Precious memories to me. Anything that God has done is precious. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; The Bible says that even in the death of the saints, precious, &gt;&gt; costly, &gt;&gt; valuable in the sight of the Lord &gt;&gt; is the death of the saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you want me to use this one so I can hold it closer? Do you want me to hold the hand, Mike? Is the question. I don't think you're going to be able to work on that too much, but you can twist all the knobs you like. I wished I had some knobs you could come and adjust me so my voice would work. The Crrenshaws have taken over the studio. Ain't that wonderful to have have to have somebody sitting in there? Let's thank God for that. [Applause] Sister Renee, I'm right. I think I'm right. Tell me if I'm not. I get a little confused. Your mother was Barbara and your dad was Neil. I'm so honored and so blessed to have you here. I'm going to use this one. Not the coat. I'm too chunky for that. I haven't been chunky since high school. I'm just just big fat. They say you can't say that, but I just did. I don't think Fluffy would get get the message across, would he? I loved the entire Green family more than I could tell you. And uh I really loved I didn't get to know them that long because it wasn't long that uh Sister Renee lost her beautiful mother. I'm telling you, she to me, I've told this everywhere. She's one of the most beautiful ladies I ever laid eyes on in my life. And it just wasn't just her natural beauty. There was just a glow about her. And um when I went to Tucson the first time, maybe the second time, I stayed in Brother Jackson's apartment at Tucson Tabernacle. One day the phone rang and it was Granny Green, your grandmother. She said, "Brother Steve, this is Granny Green." Well, that's what some of them call me. and she said, 'I just want to tell you, son, don't slow down. Keep on preaching hard and praying hard and shouting hard and don't cut them any slack and start with my family because she said, "I've got to know when I leave here that they're going to follow me all the way. I've never forgotten that. &gt;&gt; It meant something to me. It wasn't but a couple services later, Sister Renee, that brother, somebody come and punched me on the platform I was singing, the Holy Ghost will set your feet to dancing. And somebody come and said, "You better take a look cuz you may never see that again in your lifetime. That don't happen often." I said, "What is it?" And I look back in the back corner of the tabernacle and it was your dad dancing up a storm praising God with his hands in the air and his face a glow. And it meant so much to me. I've told this church before. You feel it's coming back. &gt;&gt; My voice is getting a little stronger. I feel it. &gt;&gt; I feel it. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Yeah, &gt;&gt; those I know that uh young people don't have much patience for old people when we reminisce, but uh you're at our house tonight. &gt;&gt; The joy, the joy. Brother Jeff, uh I didn't mean to call attention. I wasn't trying to be absolutely ridiculous, but how many times have I listened to a to an MP3 from the Tucson Tabernacle and Brother Green look at you down on the front row and say, "Whoa, I wished I could fit in a suit that looked like that because Brother Jeff would always be dressed so nice and colors that uh well, I wouldn't get by with, but he's got the he's got the right complexion for any color and brother Green would say, "I'm going to lose weight one of these days and I'm going to wear one of your suits." I don't know if that ever happened or not, but I could go all over this room. I've told this church every time we sang in the city where the lamb is the light. It reminds me of your dad. In that city where the lamb is the light. &gt;&gt; Woo! I've got a reservation. &gt;&gt; How many of you have a reservation? and and there's no time to slack up now. &gt;&gt; We've got to press this thing. &gt;&gt; I want you to give God praise for these amazing musicians. &gt;&gt; Anointed. [Applause] Anointed. [Applause] So glad you're all here this evening. Let's hurry. Could we stand again? First John, chapter 2. Pastor Isaac, hold up your hand so everybody knows exactly which one you are. I know that sometime he he's got a brother that looks a lot They look a lot alike. I need their wives with them to be able to tell them apart. Sometimes it's my memory. I just can't quite remember it. They're not identical. They're not twins. But that is the pastor of this beautiful group from Indiana. And uh what kind of a pastor allows his people to come and go to another church states away, hours away, and doesn't check on them, I guess, to make sure that I'm down here trying to pull them or anything like that. He's blessed &gt;&gt; to send them. He's blessed to come with them. And I just want you to know that that is very rare. &gt;&gt; It is very very rare. I don't know anything too much about uh other cultures, but I'll tell you in the in this uh church culture, church environment, pastors often get jealous of one another. They don't understand each other. They they they uh talk bad about each other. And I really appreciate the fellowship that God has given us with you precious people. We're just one and the same. But I wanted to thank you for for being with us. And uh I want to thank you for the air conditioning that you just installed in your brand new church. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful. Even though that'd be November the 1st, I'm probably going to need it. there. November 2nd, I guess, Sunday. 1 John 2 24. Let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye shall also continue in the son and in the father. &gt;&gt; Follow this. This is the promise that he hath promised us even &gt;&gt; eternal life. Sister Chloe, I I don't know why I'm in the middle of scripture reading. My kids will probably say, "Dad, what were you doing?" But I just in my mind's eye just caught a glimpse of your precious grandparents that I loved so much. And to think that you're here really blesses me. I hope sometime that they get to catch a glimpse of good things that happen among us. Don't you? &gt;&gt; I do. And I believe they do. I don't want to scare anybody or weird anybody out. Some of you are so sensitive. But I know what I've been taught and I believe it that they're not a million miles away. &gt;&gt; They're with us. They're just in a faster dimension &gt;&gt; than the one we're living in right now. &gt;&gt; You heard brother Terry sing that last night, the song he wrote, There is a land. And one of these days, we're going to step toward the middle. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to wrap my arms around Brother Al one more time. And maybe over there, Sister Minnie, too, because I love them so much. Now, back to the scripture reading. She's the one who wrote, "Oh, praise the Lord. It's Jesus that I see. The Son of Man revealed in you and me. Oh, I'm so glad that I'm part of the family where the people are perfect as can be. Don't speak evil of your brother, lest you speak evil of the law. For we know the law is perfect without a single flaw. As long as your brothers repented of the wrong that he has done, then your brother is as perfect as perfect. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise &gt;&gt; right here. the son of man revealed in you and me. Oh, I thank God that I'm part of this family where the people &gt;&gt; Lord forgive me for that interruption. This is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life. These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you. Brother Cade was singing about those who say that these things are over with. But the anointing &gt;&gt; which ye have received of him abideth &gt;&gt; abideth &gt;&gt; in you. And ye need not that any man should teach you, &gt;&gt; but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, &gt;&gt; what the anointing &gt;&gt; teaches you all things. &gt;&gt; I'm just reading what it says. And is truth &gt;&gt; and is no lie. Amen. &gt;&gt; And even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide. &gt;&gt; Somebody say abide. &gt;&gt; Ye shall abide in him. &gt;&gt; The anointing is abiding in you. &gt;&gt; And it strengthens the connection and the union between you and he. Amen. &gt;&gt; And because of that abiding anointing, you can know the grace of abiding in the vine &gt;&gt; where the life comes from. Aren't you glad? &gt;&gt; And now little children, abide in him. &gt;&gt; Look at your neighbor and say, "Abide in him." &gt;&gt; Abide. &gt;&gt; In him. &gt;&gt; In him. that when he shall appear, &gt;&gt; we don't have to run and hide our nakedness behind the bush. &gt;&gt; Little bride, where are you? &gt;&gt; But you will meet him with confidence &gt;&gt; because you have been abiding in the anointing. That anointing makes the difference. &gt;&gt; It shatters yolks. &gt;&gt; It sets captives free. &gt;&gt; Heals the sick and raises the dead. Causes tumors to fall off. &gt;&gt; And it causes blind scales &gt;&gt; to fall off of our eyes &gt;&gt; so that we no longer see creeds. and dogmas. &gt;&gt; Uh, &gt;&gt; we no longer believe that God had a mother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we can see clearly &gt;&gt; all because of the anointing. &gt;&gt; When he shall appear, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming. that voice comes calling for you and you run out from behind the bush. &gt;&gt; You say, "Here I am, Lord." &gt;&gt; You don't have anything to hide because you're already hidden. &gt;&gt; You're already hidden in him. If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born. Is born. I'm going to have to seem very oldfashioned and just I'm probably going to have to uh uh re uh speak every word here. Somebody say we'll we'll be here all night. Born. &gt;&gt; Born of him. &gt;&gt; You've already had the earth birth. &gt;&gt; But there's another birth. &gt;&gt; One that comes from above. And it's not complete until you've come all the way to the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Come all the way. &gt;&gt; Don't you be satisfied with hearing how wonderful it is &gt;&gt; or how glorious it was &gt;&gt; from the young to the old. &gt;&gt; Get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Get him. &gt;&gt; Get him. &gt;&gt; And when you've I tell you, it changes everything. Father, we need you tonight. &gt;&gt; We've already been to church. &gt;&gt; I felt what was like to me electricity. I'm so thankful. It's not about feeling. It's about faith. It's about what we know, not what we feel. But I want to thank you that every now and then, quite often you really you allow us to feel, &gt;&gt; to sense, to know that you have walked among us. And Lord, that is life to us. And it's the only thing that keeps us with an ability to do life, &gt;&gt; to pay bills, to sort out family issues, to choose where we're going to eat to go to lunch, and all the other big conflicts in life, every last one of them. Because of you, we can press through it all. We're so grateful tonight for your presence among us. We ask for you to bless your word. It's already blessed, but bless us to hear and bless your servant to speak in the name above every name. The name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And the saint said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Be seated. Would you? God bless you. I know you're a little crowded. Someone might be in your personal space. But what a good problem to have. &gt;&gt; Brother Dwayne, I thank you so much. What what what evangelist what evangelist drives and preaches a sermon and a half and still stays all week. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that doesn't happen often. &gt;&gt; They're in and out. They anymore they fly in for one night. fly out the next night. I've never even offered him a plane ticket. How terrible. But I figure that if he come if it was on a plane, he might not be able to bring them all. And he's his whole family's here tonight. Isn't God good? &gt;&gt; Look at Isaiah 10:27. Austin, you stay close to me, will you? Best you can. And it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke &gt;&gt; shall be what? &gt;&gt; Not broken. broken means in pieces with the potential of putting it back together. &gt;&gt; But when the anointing sets you free, &gt;&gt; when the anointing destroys the yoke from off of your neck, no demon, &gt;&gt; no devil, &gt;&gt; no religious system &gt;&gt; can glue it back together and control your life again. Because King Jesus &gt;&gt; has not just broken the yoke, &gt;&gt; but he has destroyed it &gt;&gt; by the power, by the authority of the anointing. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Am I annoying you yet? That burden taken away, that yoke destroyed. &gt;&gt; We are used to having the theme. It's by the word. It's by the word. It's by the word. We are birthed by the word. We're sanctified by the word. The word breaks. The word does the and that is nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; But Isaiah prophesied in a time that the word had not yet become flesh. &gt;&gt; And so he didn't say in the Messiah, the Messiah will destroy the yolk. &gt;&gt; But what is going to be in the Messiah? What will be in the Christ, &gt;&gt; what will be in the manifestation of the promised one, that that's in him will destroy, not break, destroy the yoke of bondage. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, we sometimes speak about the anointing as though it was a temporary engagement. &gt;&gt; A fleeting feeling. Oh my, didn't you feel the anointing? &gt;&gt; You ever said that? My, wasn't that song anointed? &gt;&gt; You just heard me say these musicians, anointed musicians. Well, I want you to know that any musician that would surrender their life and gift to the Lord &gt;&gt; might not even be based on their skill set. &gt;&gt; But if that anointing falls on them, &gt;&gt; it's the anointing that makes the difference. &gt;&gt; It's not seminary that makes the difference. It's not even years of experience that makes the difference. &gt;&gt; It's the anointing. &gt;&gt; And the anointing is not a temporary engagement. And the anointing is not a fleeting feeling or a temporary uncction. Right. &gt;&gt; The anointing is not just in the moment that it feels like your hair is raising up on your arm or you have a goosebump somewhere. You say, "Oh, don't you feel that?" That is not all there is. &gt;&gt; I want you to know the anointing can be working and you don't feel him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "I I just don't see how that's possible." It's possible. &gt;&gt; Because it's not your feeler. He comes to engage. &gt;&gt; It's your inner man. &gt;&gt; And sometimes when the anointing comes to the inner man, it it absolutely rushes right to the surface. &gt;&gt; And you feel it. &gt;&gt; You You have tears. You have laughter. You have joy. &gt;&gt; You you you have feeling. &gt;&gt; But don't be fooled. &gt;&gt; The anointing is not just what we feel. &gt;&gt; It's more than that. &gt;&gt; It's divine. &gt;&gt; Did you know it? &gt;&gt; The anointing is divine. They asked one time about one of the worship songs that uh that says, "I love your presence." &gt;&gt; And somebody said, "Do you think it's all right for us to say we love his presence?" rather than saying each time, "I love him." Guess what I said? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Yes. &gt;&gt; Because if you can say I love his presence, his presence is where he is. &gt;&gt; And he is where his presence is. &gt;&gt; And when you sing, I love his presence, you mean I want to be where he is. &gt;&gt; I want him to be where I am. &gt;&gt; And guess what? That's possible. Not only in revival, not only in camp meeting, but that's possible 365 days of the year. There is an abiding anointing &gt;&gt; that you and I need to be aware of &gt;&gt; that's not based on whether we have problems or conflicts or heartache or bills to pay. &gt;&gt; It's an abiding anointing. and we feed on it and we draw strength from &gt;&gt; I keep saying it. &gt;&gt; When my whole point is we're not talking about an it. &gt;&gt; We're talking about a hymn. &gt;&gt; The anointing is a hymn. I'm going to go somewhere with you in a moment. &gt;&gt; The anointing is much more than just a fleeting encounter &gt;&gt; or a good service. &gt;&gt; It's so much more. &gt;&gt; It's the great fountain of life and light. &gt;&gt; It's the logos. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; It's the eternal and invisible spirit of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the spirit, the eternal spirit that we refer to as father. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, &gt;&gt; somebody here may have forgotten that there are not three persons in this. You don't have to figure which one you're praying to, &gt;&gt; which one you're experiencing, which one you're describing because there's only one to experience. &gt;&gt; That is the eternal spirit. &gt;&gt; He manifests himself in many ways, including three offices. But that eternal spirit is one &gt;&gt; and that is watch that is the anointing. &gt;&gt; Not a feeling, &gt;&gt; not a good sermon. &gt;&gt; It's him. &gt;&gt; It's him. &gt;&gt; Either you're not persuaded &gt;&gt; or you want to listen carefully. And I like that. But I'm still going to need to sick them every now and then. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the one which is and which was and which is to come. &gt;&gt; The anointing is Emmanuel. &gt;&gt; God with us. &gt;&gt; He's the almighty one. &gt;&gt; The anointing is a person. &gt;&gt; He's the Messiah, the Christ, the anointed one. The anointing is the spirit and life of the anointed one. &gt;&gt; The anointing is the spirit and life of the anointed one. &gt;&gt; If you have experienced the spirit and the life of the Messiah, of the anointed one, &gt;&gt; then you have experienced him. There's no difference between him and his spirit. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; the anointing is not an it. &gt;&gt; It's him. &gt;&gt; There is no pronoun confusion here. &gt;&gt; Him. &gt;&gt; I met him. I felt him. &gt;&gt; I experienced him. &gt;&gt; I had a yoke destroyed off of my neck because of him. &gt;&gt; Not it. &gt;&gt; Him. &gt;&gt; Before the word was written, before the Bible existed, &gt;&gt; there was him. Before there was anything to worship, &gt;&gt; there was him. &gt;&gt; There's some folks around our ranks that are getting a little sideswiped &gt;&gt; by this. Who would have ever thought after fighting the wondous battle we would have preachers preaching tuness? &gt;&gt; Why would you stop at tunis? What about fiveness, sixness, sevenness? You will never be able to put God in your theological box. &gt;&gt; He can manifest himself father, son, and holy ghost. but also healer, deliverer, counselor, mighty God. &gt;&gt; And this isn't 10 different one. &gt;&gt; One one spirit him &gt;&gt; even before he was worshiped him. Thank God. &gt;&gt; There was nothing to worship him &gt;&gt; until he created something &gt;&gt; to worship him. &gt;&gt; And then he had to create a himymn. &gt;&gt; Oh, I better be careful. &gt;&gt; He had to to begin the creation work &gt;&gt; of your redemption. and he had to put him &gt;&gt; in a body of flesh. &gt;&gt; We're getting ahead of oursel a little bit. You see, it all goes back to Deuteronomy 6:4. Here, here in Hebrew, Schma Mama says to her son, &gt;&gt; one word. And to that child, it says, "Are you listening?" [Music] &gt;&gt; God is saying to us in his word, Schma, are you listening to me? &gt;&gt; Oh, Israel, &gt;&gt; the Lord, which is the Yode V. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham even told us, he said, "Now, we know Jehovah's not right, &gt;&gt; but it's the English word that we have and we use it, but he said, "We know it's not right. It's what some people call the impronouncable, unpronouncable word of name of God, the yod and the vau, which we we could say Yava, Yahweh, Yahweh. But our English Bible has helped us not make ignorant mistakes and it has always been translated Lord. The real word for Lord is not Yahweh. The real word is Adonai. And there are places where you will read the word Lord and it'll be Adonai. There are places where you will read uh Lord and it will really be the divine name. Why are you Why are you even saying this? I want you to know who's talking to you. I'm not talking to you. But I might look at some of you and say, &gt;&gt; "Hear me." &gt;&gt; Oh, spiritual Israel, royal seed of Abraham, hear me. The Lord Yahweh, &gt;&gt; the only God, &gt;&gt; our God, &gt;&gt; which is Elohim. That word God there is Elohim. And they like to say, you know, our brothers, our cousins, they like to say, there you go. Elohim is a plural noun. They don't know a whole lot about Hebrew. I don't either. But in Hebrew, even an adamant object has gender. &gt;&gt; Now, I know you have never met a female chair. or a male chair. But in Hebrew, it's spoken that way. &gt;&gt; And the gender uh translation, the word that's used to describe that chair as female or male is dependent on who's talking about the chair, who's sitting in the chair, who's moving the chair. If Jacob were to reach up there and move that chair, we would choose a male word to describe the chair because we wouldn't want to say that Jacob is picking up a female chair and moving it all around. Nothing wrong with that, but that's just not the way Hebrew works. And just because a Hebrew word is classified as a plurality doesn't mean that you're talking about more than one God. &gt;&gt; The word Elohim is a plurality of attributes of offices of abilities. &gt;&gt; All that he can do &gt;&gt; makes him our Elohim. You're saying a lot when you call him Elohim. &gt;&gt; You can say Elohim. It's English. Uh in Hebrew, when you're when you're using the plural form of a word, it's not I am, it's im. And so I like to say Elohim. And when we're calling on Elohim, we're calling on the government of God, the healing virtue of God, the creative power of God, what he did as father, what he does as son, what he does as Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; uh what he does as problem solver, &gt;&gt; mountain mover, wonder worker. &gt;&gt; If God can do it, he is it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I'm really going to say something after a while. &gt;&gt; If God can do it, he is it. &gt;&gt; Did you understand that God is not just what he can accomplish? It's not just what he does for us that causes us to love him. That's right. &gt;&gt; We love him because of who he is. &gt;&gt; If he never saved another soul, I'm not going to fall out of love with him. &gt;&gt; If he never healed my body again, I'm not going to stop loving him &gt;&gt; because I don't love him for his favors. I love him for who he is. &gt;&gt; And in order to know who he is, you've got to read the book. You've got to read the God manual. &gt;&gt; These big companies, they're charging uh big prices for appliances that aren't going to last. &gt;&gt; They know they're not going to last when they make them, &gt;&gt; and they don't want you to know too much about them. So now you don't even get a manual. &gt;&gt; You get a QR code. &gt;&gt; And it'll take you to a little little bit of information. &gt;&gt; Don't stand in water and plug it in. Please remove all clothes from your children before you put them in the washing machine. English is somebody's second, third, fourth, or fifth language. When they tell you to take the clothes off your children before you put them clothes or children you used to get manuals. How many of you know &gt;&gt; cataloges every language and uh I know some of you threw them out. I didn't. I know you have no problem believing that. And when one drawer would fill up, brother Sulfus of of manuals, we just make another drawer &gt;&gt; because we we didn't want to. And we kept the boxes for a lot of things, too. &gt;&gt; Because we might want to send it back. &gt;&gt; Things sure are different now. &gt;&gt; God still has a manual. You don't have to guess what you're going to get. &gt;&gt; How long it's going to last, &gt;&gt; what it's going to be able to do for you. &gt;&gt; What he's not going to do for you. &gt;&gt; He sent his word. &gt;&gt; His word still works. &gt;&gt; It may be oldfashioned to some, &gt;&gt; but not to this little bride. &gt;&gt; It's our life manual. It's our life coach. &gt;&gt; It's the correction that we need. It's the encouragement that we need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here, Schma. Oh, Israel, the the Yahweh, our Elohim is Ekhad one. Not Elohim one. Elohim one is a plural one based on abilities and attributes. But eh, Ekhad is a singular one. And the servant of the Lord wanted us to know as God was speaking in his heart, in his ear at times. &gt;&gt; He wanted us to know that the Lord our God is one &gt;&gt; so that we wouldn't get confused. Denominational people will tell me sometime, "I don't know who to pray to. &gt;&gt; Should I pray to the father? Should I pray to the son? Would it be wrong if I called on the holy ghost?" And I said, "Well, there's I know some people will stress a protocol. Uh, I'm going to stress some protocols, but I'm not going to tell you how you have to call because I'll tell you this, he'll come if your heart is fixed on him. &gt;&gt; You don't have to call him in Hebrew. &gt;&gt; You don't have to call him in Greek. &gt;&gt; You don't even have to say his name. &gt;&gt; We should. It's good to. There's authority in the name. But once your heart has been regenerated in spirit, you're joined to the Lord. &gt;&gt; The New Testament said we are one spirit, &gt;&gt; joined to him. &gt;&gt; So he knows what you need before you call. So if all you have time to say is help &gt;&gt; and you didn't even give him a royal title, how many of you know you don't think it, &gt;&gt; you know it. &gt;&gt; He would come. &gt;&gt; Because it's not what you call him that makes him come. &gt;&gt; It's who you are that makes him come. If your spirit has been joined to the Lord, you're one spirit with him. &gt;&gt; I don't think you have to even utter. I do believe I I believe in praying and I I'm not a I'm not a meditational prayer person who prays it all inside. I don't have to say it out loud and I know you don't have to scream and I know you have to do a lot of things, but I uh was raised in the Pentecostal church where where we pounded the altar and thought that God was hard of hearing. So sometime I may get a little loud when I'm praying. It's not to get his attention &gt;&gt; because he's as close &gt;&gt; as a heart &gt;&gt; a heart thought &gt;&gt; of who he is. &gt;&gt; And he's bigger than anything you can imagine. &gt;&gt; He's bigger than anything I can imagine. &gt;&gt; Just give me a few more moments here. &gt;&gt; He's bigger. He's so much bigger. And he said, "I want to join my spirit to that spirit that you came here with. You came here by the by the curse of the fall. You came here with a broken spirit, with an unregenerated spirit." Some of you would say soul uh because it's of that great tripartate controversy around the message people um of which it is. So again, don't worry about what I call it. Listen to where I'm placing it. And I'm placing the soul in the middle ground and the spirit on the inside of the inside. But if you need to be a purist and you're more dedicated to how it was called on a quote than how it was called in the scripture, that doesn't bother me. But don't miss the function &gt;&gt; because that's that's big. &gt;&gt; The function of what this tripartate man, how it works together is big. And our spirit was fallen, broken because of the fall. But once you call on his name in repentance, &gt;&gt; there is a life. &gt;&gt; He &gt;&gt; comes. &gt;&gt; And when he comes in spirit, &gt;&gt; he can't come in flesh or person to you and live in you. He comes in spirit and he goes right to that fallen spirit &gt;&gt; and joins himself. &gt;&gt; Oh, how much he loves me that he would join himself to my fallen human inner man. But he knows that if he does, that spirit receives a birth. It receives a regeneration and it's no longer fallen. It's no longer broken. It's no longer adamic. It no longer is associated with the Eve or with the curse or with the deception or with original sin, but it is now joined as one unto the Lord. Come on. &gt;&gt; And he realizes as God knowing everything, now I have possession of what I paid for &gt;&gt; and I'm going to move in this spirit, &gt;&gt; my child, my son, my daughter will say, even though there's no gender in this, &gt;&gt; God doesn't deliver a woman differently than he delivers a man. &gt;&gt; There's no gender in what we're talking about. neither male nor female. The scripture tells us clearly &gt;&gt; that doesn't mean they're not differences of administrations and offices and jobs. But but but I'm telling you, a sister has every right, every need and every right to be one with him &gt;&gt; and to hear him &gt;&gt; and have him move &gt;&gt; and direct. And then that middle ground, whatever you call it, &gt;&gt; of mind, will, and emotion, &gt;&gt; that's where the battle rages. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, in the soul, &gt;&gt; the battle's raging &gt;&gt; or in the spirit. &gt;&gt; If that's your middle ground, the mind and the will and the emotions, there's a war going on there. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham told us, "The greatest battle ever fought is fought in the mind." That's the middle ground. &gt;&gt; It's not the human brain. It's the ability to think and process. And that doesn't come to us in spirit. That comes to us in mind, will, and emotion. It comes to us in a soul realm. &gt;&gt; And that soul realm is where the war is. &gt;&gt; And as soon as you agree with the flesh, &gt;&gt; the other side of who you are, this part, &gt;&gt; as soon as you agree with the flesh, your mind and your will and your emotions will come into alignment with the atmosphere of this earth. And we have not been sent here to agree with what's around us. &gt;&gt; We're here to agree with the word. &gt;&gt; Somebody agree with the word with me. &gt;&gt; If it says it, I believe it. &gt;&gt; If God can do it for anybody, he can do it for me. If God ever did it one time, &gt;&gt; he can do it again. &gt;&gt; He can do it again. He can do it again. That's who he is. That's who he is. &gt;&gt; Whichever you feed, &gt;&gt; your regenerated spirit that has been joined with the Lord is one. It doesn't feed on feeling. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It doesn't feed on a good song. It doesn't feed on that thrill that you have when you get on the scale and you see that you've come through camp meeting and didn't even gain a pound. Oh, he it it doesn't respond to that. That spirit part of who you are, soul if you like, responds only to the word. Depending on what you feed it, &gt;&gt; this inner man, the all all the inside part of who I am, whatever you feed it &gt;&gt; determines which part of you grows &gt;&gt; and gets stronger. If you're feeding the word and you're feasting on the word, you're hearing the word, you're reading the word, you're confessing the word, you're declaring the word, you're prophesying the word, &gt;&gt; that spirit man just rises up like a champion in you, joined to the Lord. But if you start feeding on the &gt;&gt; and the gunk &gt;&gt; and the junk, &gt;&gt; that doesn't feed spirit man. &gt;&gt; That doesn't feed that that's been joined unto the Lord. It feeds that inner part of who we are, the mind, the will, and the emotions. And our emotions will control us if we feed that part of who we are more than we feed that inner part, the most inner part. &gt;&gt; Whatever you feed. &gt;&gt; And we learned years ago the analogy of the stickman and the sumo wrestler. And if uh if someone could look inside of you, one of your inner parts is going to be larger, stronger, bigger, bolder &gt;&gt; than the other. &gt;&gt; I want my inner being, the part of me that's been regenerated and joined under the Lord as one. I want that to be the sumo wrestler. Because when the doctor says we can't help you, &gt;&gt; I don't need emotion to kick in. &gt;&gt; And I don't need your sad story &gt;&gt; about your cousin &gt;&gt; Matroid that had the same thing and didn't live a day. She dead before she got home. &gt;&gt; Isn't that how people do you? &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to have surgery. You are. What kind of surgery you going to have? Oh, whatever. knee. Oh my. My neighbor had the knee surgery. They told her she'd be all right. She's She's not. She wasn't all right. Oh, I shouldn't be telling you that. &gt;&gt; And your emotions are &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And and you start feeling that unbelief creep up. &gt;&gt; And and and you start say, "Oh, Lord of mercy, I don't know. Maybe I should just hobble the rest of my life." And that happens because you've been feeding the mind and the will and the emotion more. &gt;&gt; You've been entertaining that part of who you are more than you've been engaging the God part of who you are. &gt;&gt; There's a part of God in you. &gt;&gt; Have you had a new birth? &gt;&gt; Has his spirit joined with yours and regenerated it and resurrected it and revived it and resuscitated and made it new? Yes, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham told us he said this is not a soul replacement &gt;&gt; or spirit replacement. &gt;&gt; He said that that kind of thing is a Mormon doctrine. &gt;&gt; He said this is a a a a transformation, &gt;&gt; a change &gt;&gt; that takes place on the inside of the inside. And I want to tell you something. There's only one force that I know of that can make that difference in you, and it's the anointing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Remember, he's not a feeling. &gt;&gt; He's almighty God. &gt;&gt; He is a person because that almighty God came in the form of our Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; who is the only person of the Godhead. &gt;&gt; The rest are attributes of the same spirit, &gt;&gt; the same God. Oh yes. And if you don't get that right, if you don't get that right, you'll still be referring to the anointing as an it and a feeling. And what we're about to face on these closing hours of planet Earth, you won't know what to do with because you won't even know who you are. &gt;&gt; You won't know what you are. &gt;&gt; If I don't know what I am, I don't know what I have to fight with. If I don't know who I am, I don't know whose I am. &gt;&gt; It's not because of who I am. It's because of who's. &gt;&gt; I'm a possession bought, paid for, purchased &gt;&gt; by an incorruptible price. &gt;&gt; Jesus wanted to make sure that we didn't miss the schma in Deuteronomy. And so he quotes right from it in 12 Mark 12:29. Jesus answered him, "The first of all the commandments is what? &gt;&gt; Schma, listen up. Stop what you're doing. Finish your religious duty so that you can hear my voice. I I never hear the voice, brother Shel. I never hear the voice. Not the loud audible voice. Not the inner quiet whisper voice. I I I I never hear his voice. What should I do? Do you want the sanitized version of what you should do? &gt;&gt; Or do you want the Shelly version &gt;&gt; without cussing? Of course, &gt;&gt; I'll tell you how to hear his voice. Shut up. &gt;&gt; Shut up. &gt;&gt; We think that prayer is telling God everything he already knows. And sometimes prayer is not telling God anything at all &gt;&gt; except I adore you. I love you. I I you're everything to me. &gt;&gt; How is that prayer? It's prayer. &gt;&gt; And if you need to hear his voice, shut up. &gt;&gt; Don't belly ache. Don't complain. Don't tell God everything you already know. Nobody know. Jesus, you couldn't possibly know. Oh God, you could never know what it's like to live my life. &gt;&gt; Oh, but he can and he does. &gt;&gt; He was the high priest who is touched by the feelings of our infirmities because he became us. &gt;&gt; God became man so that man can become &gt;&gt; one with him. one with him. &gt;&gt; You see, if the reason why I know that God is one and not three or four or five or six or 10 or a dozen, the reason why I know is everything about God is a model for who you should be. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, that sounds far out there." Well, no. It's all part of the bridal paradigm. And the bridal paradigm is not to have two persons &gt;&gt; getting along with one another. &gt;&gt; That's a trinitarian concept. &gt;&gt; It's unbiblical and it hardly works. &gt;&gt; You you you you know that's the 50/50 thing. &gt;&gt; You know, if you want to have a good marriage, you you got to know it's 50/50. If there's anybody in here believes that you're engaged, &gt;&gt; you're not married. &gt;&gt; I heard an amen there. Recognize the voice. &gt;&gt; It's true for all of us. It's 100% &gt;&gt; and 100%. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Does that make 200%?" No, it makes 100%. God's mathematics are not like ours. &gt;&gt; If a man gives 100% and a woman gives 100%, they're 100% operating together. And in order to do that, they're hearing, they're listening, they're sensing who who who leads us, who directs us instead of arguing about who's the head and who's the neck &gt;&gt; and who's the stronger and who's the weaker &gt;&gt; and who's usurping and who's dominating. &gt;&gt; Become one. &gt;&gt; Both of you fall in love with Jesus. Hear him. &gt;&gt; Hear him. &gt;&gt; Somebody said that just wouldn't be possible with my companion. Maybe you should be one of the singles among us because maybe you weren't waiting as long as you should wait. Maybe you weren't hearing as much as you should hear. &gt;&gt; And I know that some of you have to get you have to get by. the best way you can get by. But you ought to be a voice &gt;&gt; if it doesn't cost you a divorce. You ought to be a voice to a young man who hasn't chosen his life companion yet. And you ought to be a voice. Listen how quiet it'll get. &gt;&gt; You ought to be a voice to a young sister who hadn't had a husband yet and who thinks that she is an old maid at 23. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Where do you get such a stupid idea as that? Probably in front of that idiot box. &gt;&gt; I'm not just talking about the one sits in the corner. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the one we toad around with us wherever we go. Society says, &gt;&gt; society says, social media says, influencers say, &gt;&gt; you better wait. You better wait until you know that you know that you know that you have found somebody &gt;&gt; who's not going to waste the first years of their marriage with you fighting over who's the boss. &gt;&gt; I I've heard them draw the boundary lines. &gt;&gt; I've heard them say, "Now, anything past this line, you run. That's the kitchen. &gt;&gt; The rest of the house, I'm the boss. What if she told you to come into her domain and wash the dishes? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I thought. You didn't make her the boss over there, did you? You just wanted to make her feel like she had something. &gt;&gt; Anybody follow me? Why are you even saying this? Because to be joined as one &gt;&gt; means that each is preferring the other. &gt;&gt; Is it always easy? No. Is it always done? No. But it's the goal. And the reason why it's the goal is so that you and I can learn to lay our will down &gt;&gt; in oneness, &gt;&gt; in union, &gt;&gt; in union &gt;&gt; with Christ &gt;&gt; with the anointing &gt;&gt; with the anointed one. &gt;&gt; Is it getting late yet? &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Well, it is. &gt;&gt; No, sir. Well, I mean, it doesn't change the fact that it is. I want you to get something here. Jesus, he finished it out. The first of all the commandments here, O Israel, the Lord our God, this anointing, this Christ, this God manifested. He doesn't have a beginning. &gt;&gt; He will never have an ending. He always is because he always was. &gt;&gt; And he always will be. &gt;&gt; And he's not just the I was. &gt;&gt; Or the I will be. &gt;&gt; In most every situation, he is the I am. &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; He is Jehovah. Rafa &gt;&gt; your healer. &gt;&gt; He is the God who can do for you. &gt;&gt; What you can never do for yourself. &gt;&gt; He's not just El Shai, the one who can feed you from his breast, &gt;&gt; plural. &gt;&gt; He is the God who can do for you. &gt;&gt; The God of ultimate ruin. Yes. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "What in the world does that even mean?" The God of ultimate ruin and destruction. It means nothing can stand in his way when he determines to move. I want you to know now, God is determined to move in this bride. In these last days, she will not fizzle out. The church may fizzle. &gt;&gt; The charismaniacs may fizzle. &gt;&gt; The denominationalist may fizzle. &gt;&gt; But there will be a bride &gt;&gt; over the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; Some of them never get to a church building. But they've got to the one whose name was supposed to be over the door. &gt;&gt; This bridal paradigm is not necessarily about perfect attendance in all situations. &gt;&gt; It's about relationship and it's about covenant. And the one thing about relationship is if it's good, you want more. The more you experience him in relationship, &gt;&gt; the more you will want to &gt;&gt; I don't just mean feel him with the flesh. Feel him on the inside, sense him, know him, discern him, discover him &gt;&gt; on the inside. &gt;&gt; And then you just want to sit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's good. and listen. Oh God, my children, my children. Oh God, my husband, my husband. Oh God, my knee, my knee. Oh God, he's not Santa Claus. &gt;&gt; He's not the Easter Bunny. &gt;&gt; He's not the doting grandfather. He wants more than your list. &gt;&gt; He wants the fullness of your heart. &gt;&gt; He wants to know that he cannot just be with you, but he can be in you. &gt;&gt; And not only in you, but one with you. &gt;&gt; There is an invisible union. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There is an invisible union. And the heavenly bridegroom desires to be one. with a heavenly bride. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, the title is an earthly bride. That's exactly right. We're living in that sphere now. We're living in the earth realm now. We've definitely had the earth birth now. But the reality is that's not the union that he's looking for because he no longer desires to to be one with this planet. &gt;&gt; This planet is going to go &gt;&gt; according to the word. This planet is going to melt with a fervent heat. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Isn't this a beautiful country?" Yes, but it's going to burn. &gt;&gt; Don't you love Europe and the Alps? Oh my. Yes. Norway and the fjords. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Don't you just love the the fire in Iceland and the ice in Greenland? &gt;&gt; All of it. &gt;&gt; Sure. But it's going to melt with a fervent heat. &gt;&gt; Because it's not with this planet that he desires to become one. &gt;&gt; It's with a bride that has been transfigured. &gt;&gt; She was once a part of this earth and its system &gt;&gt; ashes to ashes and dust to dust. But her real identity is hidden for now. &gt;&gt; But she didn't come from earth. Uhoh. &gt;&gt; There's the biggest part of who she is that had nothing to do with planet Earth &gt;&gt; because the gene representation of God was in that little bride [Music] &gt;&gt; before the world was founded &gt;&gt; and framed. This is not extreme Calvinism &gt;&gt; that says God lined everybody up against a wall and he said, "You're savable. You're not savable. You're savable. You're not savable." That's a heresy that they like to teach around the message. You you you should have stayed with what he said &gt;&gt; and off of Google &gt;&gt; because if he said it and it goes back to the word, you can stand on it. &gt;&gt; But Calvin had some problems &gt;&gt; and Armenianism had some problems. &gt;&gt; And that's why we needed a balance. &gt;&gt; Predestination is real. It's right. Don't you let your denominational tell your church tell you there's nothing to to predestination. The Bible said so. &gt;&gt; We don't have time to preach it. I I think I've preached enough of that for the last 50 years just about. &gt;&gt; But um it's fornowledge. And the reason why God could know who would &gt;&gt; and who would not &gt;&gt; have eternal life &gt;&gt; is because he could see in his fornowledge &gt;&gt; your choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'll get it right from the beginning and I'll help them get it right from the beginning." And those that would choose, those that would say yes, those that would accept him, he said, "I'll give them a prefix destiny." &gt;&gt; He rigged it &gt;&gt; because of me, because of you. Somebody say, "I don't like that kind of preaching." I didn't uh we didn't take a poll &gt;&gt; of what kind of preaching you liked. I'm just thankful to have enough voice to preach a little bit. But if he knew you were going to say yes, &gt;&gt; he said, "I might as well pack them with something, &gt;&gt; there won't be no way they can lose [Music] &gt;&gt; because I've heard they're eternal." That yes, &gt;&gt; you don't remember it. &gt;&gt; It was in the mind of God. It was in the knowledge of God. It was in the omniscience, the fornowledge of God. But when he saw your big old yes, somebody said, "I said yes in an oldfashioned order." I'm glad you did. But that's not the yes that slid you in. The yes that slid you in is the one you made in the mind of God before the foundation of the world was laid. And God said, "Because of that yes, &gt;&gt; I'm going to put a part of who I am. That's right. &gt;&gt; A a a a sliver of my DNA. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't believe that. Don't care &gt;&gt; whether you believe that or not. I believe it." And that's the reason why the devil says, "Give up. Quit. Nobody likes you. Everybody hates you. You might as well eat worms." When the devil tells you all that, that's why I've been able to tell him all these years, "You're a liar. You're a liar. You're a liar. And I'm not looking for the favor of man anyway. I'm looking for the favor of God who placed a part of who he is [Applause] &gt;&gt; in me. &gt;&gt; It's a balance. &gt;&gt; God didn't force you. He allowed you. &gt;&gt; There's a lot to that that we can't preach about tonight. But sometime when you're complaining about the hardness of your way, come see me. And I'll remind you that in the mind of God, when you are making that yes, Your destiny was playing &gt;&gt; and you weren't just saying yes. I'm so sorry to tell you. You weren't just saying yes to the good times. &gt;&gt; You were agreeing, oh Lord, every heartache, &gt;&gt; every wrong turn in the road, sir, &gt;&gt; every betrayal. As your destiny from the mind of God was rolling past and you said yes to God, when you said yes to God, in his mind, he saw it before it ever happened. &gt;&gt; And because of that, he was able to give you a destiny. &gt;&gt; And in that destiny, there will be strength &gt;&gt; to get through every hard time, &gt;&gt; every wound, every hurt, &gt;&gt; every battle. I want you to know tonight as we close in a minute or two, Jesus didn't hurt you. &gt;&gt; It was church. It was people. You know why church is so hurtful &gt;&gt; cuz there's people there. &gt;&gt; And people are hurtful. But they have they've been hurt &gt;&gt; and they bleed &gt;&gt; and they'll bleed on you. &gt;&gt; Hurt people hurt people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But everything you need to keep bringing your mind, your spirit, your emotion, your will back to the center of God's plan for your life. Everything you need, everything to equip you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many of you ever said something like like I don't know if you ever said this, Sister Pam, or not, but I I think most any wife would walking through the things you've walked through, there must have been a moment that you thought, I can't make it without Garvis. I I I couldn't live without him. And you were right in the sense that life will never be the same down here without him. But you were not right. If you ever thought that you were never you weren't right then when you said I couldn't make it without him. You were so wrong. And God knew that when you lay up there in that intensive care unit on a ventilator for how long? How long? Five weeks. A machine breathing for her. and what she needed to get through that wasn't outside. You know, our prayers, I hope I hope our prayers, I hope our faith and everybody who loved her, I hope it made a difference. I believe that it made a difference. But the reality is that everything she needed in that darkest moment of COVID and everything she needs in the darkest moment and I could come right here. Here's here's this mama who has buried both children. We could go right back to Sister West. We could go all over this building. And then that moment when you think you can't do it, you must remember that before you ever landed on the planet. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Somebody said, "I just don't believe it like that." Then you don't don't dare use the word sovereign. &gt;&gt; Don't dare try to tell me God is sovereign &gt;&gt; and then take his sovereignty. Don't preach to me about a devil that's more powerful than the God that I've committed my life to. Don't tell me the enemy is more powerful. And don't tell me that earth hangs in the balance depending on whether the church prays. Don't tell me that it it sounds right, but it's not biblically correct. God has the ability whether I pray or not pray. &gt;&gt; He is sovereign &gt;&gt; and he knows exactly where where America is headed. &gt;&gt; And and as she's going down, &gt;&gt; as she's going down, there's going to be some of the DNA of God. those anointed people. &gt;&gt; Those messiahs, &gt;&gt; those anointeds &gt;&gt; who gather under his anointing, &gt;&gt; they're going up. &gt;&gt; Uh the earth is going down and the society is going down and religion is going down and even the church as we have known it. And that makes some people so mad. Somebody said, "You shouldn't talk about his church." He loves his church. He does. He loves his church so much. He gave his life for her. &gt;&gt; And he would do it all over again. If it would, if it would make any difference, he would do it all over again. But he doesn't have to &gt;&gt; because what he did, he did right. &gt;&gt; He was looking for a people &gt;&gt; who could hear him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. who could say what he says &gt;&gt; and do what he tells them to do &gt;&gt; and finish this thing. &gt;&gt; And then he's taking his DNA out of here. &gt;&gt; He's going to finish his covenant with the Jewish people. &gt;&gt; He said he would. &gt;&gt; He's going to give us glorious times on the other side. But the earth as we know it is not ever going to look like this again. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't know how we Oh, because there's a new heaven and a new earth out there waiting for God's people one of these days." &gt;&gt; And please don't be the buffoon who says, "Uh, how do we know it won't ever happen again?" Don't be him. We know it because of three words. You You don't have to hear but three words in the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; To know that we won't have to go back and have Adam and Eve doing it again. &gt;&gt; And we won't. In fact, he gets loosed after a thousand years of tumbling in a bottomless pit. That old serpent, that dragon, that slimy devil, he gets one more shot at the nations. &gt;&gt; Read the book. &gt;&gt; But rather unsuccessful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God brings it to an end. &gt;&gt; And he is no more. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because hell and everything that's with it is going to be uh utterly I know the church makes everything eternal. &gt;&gt; But the Bible's clear. &gt;&gt; The soul that sinnth dies. &gt;&gt; I don't know when. I don't know how long. Maybe 10 billion world 10 billion years if there was such a thing on the other side of eternity. I don't know. But the reality is it's never going to happen again. It's never going to happen again. It's never going to happen again. Just like God said, "I'll never destroy the earth by water again." He won't. It'll be fire next time. How do you know? Cuz God said so. &gt;&gt; How do we know it'll ever happen again? And the n everybody will be deceived again and there'll be another need for sacrifice again. &gt;&gt; Three words. You don't have to be a theologian to find them. &gt;&gt; It is &gt;&gt; finished. Not just salvation, the entire redemption of the purposes of God were signed, sealed, and delivered. [Applause] But he screamed micians. I I mean musicians cuz to play for some people they have to be a little of both. I haven't even preached but I want to. But I better go. Let me say a few more things. Don't leave you hanging because I may never see some of you again as long as I live. Uh I thought maybe after last night I wouldn't see some of you again, but my last memory of you would have been a very good one. Thank you for coming and being a part of the banquet last night. And I will tell you this, the the half of the story was not told because we couldn't tell it. 50 years. My poor little Mariah, she had to take all those pictures that I sent her, scans of scans, and crop them to where they could be sent off. And I thought as blurry as they were when they went, we didn't pay to have them restored. We just had to pay to have them printed. And I'm telling you, technology is amazing. They not only printed them, they cleared them pennies for what you would think it would have cost. And those memories, oh my goodness, those memories to me, they're not just people. They represent healings and miracles and the word broken before us battles. And somebody said, "You you even put people up here that left the church in a huff." I don't know if I'd have put somebody up that left the church in a huff. Why not? They were a part of our story &gt;&gt; and I love them now and they loved me then. &gt;&gt; So I put a picture up of when they loved me. Ain't that sneaky? &gt;&gt; And I don't have to remember the rest. What does it matter? &gt;&gt; That was just a part of my yes. &gt;&gt; Part of my yes. That son-in-law that you don't get along with. That mother-in-law that you can't hardly bear. &gt;&gt; Party or yes. He either sees it or all or he doesn't see anything. &gt;&gt; It helps me to know that it's not having the best doctor. or the best hospital &gt;&gt; or the best chemo. &gt;&gt; It's having the best creator &gt;&gt; and having his perfect and sovereign will &gt;&gt; activated in your life. &gt;&gt; Does prayer change things? It certainly does. &gt;&gt; But we don't pray to change the mind of God. &gt;&gt; That's new age. We pray to have grace to to accept the will of God even in those times that it didn't turn out the way we wanted it to turn out. &gt;&gt; Can I say this, brother Chris? You you won't be offended if I talk to Anita like this. I hope. Did you see those pictures, sister Anita, of you and brother Steve and and better days and some weaker days. And I want you to know that if prayer and fasting and sacrifice and giving and others others those who did it with you and mama who did it with you who prayed if that would have changed the mind of God if that could have turned things around you wouldn't be on that organ tonight. and I love you, but it'd be red hair, not red head. You know, I love you. But God said after all the battle, you precious church people who pray after all the battle. I I wonder if God may may have even Oh, I'd love to I'd love to do that for them. He loves us. &gt;&gt; He cares about what we care about. &gt;&gt; And I believe when we hurt, he hurts. And it must hurt him even more to know that with one blink, one one word, it could all be different. &gt;&gt; But there is a plan. &gt;&gt; And that plan is to bring you to your full union. &gt;&gt; We may lose more by the way of the grave, but the reality is they're going ahead of us. But they're not going to get all the way without us. &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us they're resting. Now &gt;&gt; to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord. But they've not seen King Jesus. &gt;&gt; Not according to that word. &gt;&gt; They're in his presence. It must be wonderful. &gt;&gt; But they without us And the dead in Christ &gt;&gt; shall rise first, &gt;&gt; and we which are alive and remain. &gt;&gt; Did you know there are people in this room &gt;&gt; that part of their overcoming &gt;&gt; is not only going to be overcoming in the spirit, but they're going to overcome the last enemy? Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you know I believe that there are people in this room that will never taste the sting of natural death? They'll never know what it feels like to go that way. Because I believe there are people in this room that are being prepared &gt;&gt; for a resurrection &gt;&gt; for a rapture translation [Applause] &gt;&gt; to overcome even that last enemy. And they're waiting on us. &gt;&gt; And they're pulling for us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And they're reminding God. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't Don't forget them. &gt;&gt; I know you never will, but don't forget them. I had to leave. I had to leave. I had to leave. But don't you dare forget them. Move for them. &gt;&gt; Scripture says, &gt;&gt; "Are we not compassed about with such a great cloud of witnesses? And are they not also cheering us on from balconies beyond? &gt;&gt; You can. &gt;&gt; You can. &gt;&gt; You must. &gt;&gt; You will. &gt;&gt; Revelation 18:48. Let's see. We've been here since 6 7 8. &gt;&gt; Are we in hour five yet? &gt;&gt; I've got to stop in a bit. Revelation 1 verse 5 and 6. And from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten. &gt;&gt; Do you know why I don't have to be angry with God that I've had loved ones go by the way of the grave? Because I know the one who foreran the way. &gt;&gt; He chose to give his life &gt;&gt; to die the death &gt;&gt; to to to not allow death to defeat to be the first fruits of them that slept the first fruits of those who experienced death. He chose that for me to give me peace &gt;&gt; when I had to say goodbye to my mama. You saw her in the film last night. I didn't have to worry about never seeing her again &gt;&gt; because I know the one who made the way. &gt;&gt; I know the one that did that just for me and did that just for you to help us to know that the way has already been ran for us. And even as one has become the first fruits &gt;&gt; by reason of first fruits, there's another harvest behind it. &gt;&gt; First fruits are those that got ripe. &gt;&gt; There's other seed going to get ripe. &gt;&gt; So if one goes that way and rises, it gives us the promise &gt;&gt; that every other believer &gt;&gt; who goes that way with eternal life. and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us. Oh, we better read it again. And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us. Somebody say, &gt;&gt; loved us. &gt;&gt; Washed us &gt;&gt; from our &gt;&gt; in the bleach of his own blood. Not Mary's blood, &gt;&gt; not Joseph's blood. &gt;&gt; Blood like had never been represented on the earth. &gt;&gt; Not animal blood. Because there was no soul life in that bleeding animal, bleeding animal, but blood specifically created by the creator with the life, with the DNA, &gt;&gt; with the anointing in its molecules specifically designed &gt;&gt; for the redemption of the fallen sons of Adam. The son of God became a son of man so that we the fallen sons of men might become the sons of God &gt;&gt; and beyond. one ehad with him. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Wouldn't that be an Elohim?" Multiple personalities, multiple attributes, multi. No. It's a nead one with him. Singular meaning the same spirit life. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't know if that'll preach through the book." I tell you it will and it will preach through the gospel. Do you remember those gospels? &gt;&gt; You Daniel lovers, you Revelation lovers, did you all remember that there's a Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John? &gt;&gt; Did you remember there's a lot of red letters and words in those four gospels? And did you hear him when he said &gt;&gt; you've been looking for him all along &gt;&gt; and I was right here with you all along &gt;&gt; and you didn't know he was here. &gt;&gt; Did you not hear him when he said when you've seen me &gt;&gt; you've seen him? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And from Jesus Christ, who is a faithful witness to the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood. &gt;&gt; Own blood and hath made us. &gt;&gt; Oh no. Anything I've said tonight that's already been said, I didn't just took it. It's been here. &gt;&gt; Brother Joe was on it. Brother Gley was on it. Brother Dwayne was on it because God had a plan in the meeting. &gt;&gt; He wanted to tie it all together. Made us kings and priests. Made us &gt;&gt; us. &gt;&gt; Kings and priests unto God and his father. To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. And here's a key for you to take home. And I'll I'll finish tomorrow if I have the voice. Revelation 3:14. If I don't, Brother Dwayne will if he's here. No. Yes. Well, if you was responsible for some of this tonight, please pray for me cuz my voice has &gt;&gt; certainly different than it was when I started. &gt;&gt; I thought the more you wore it out, the weaker it would supposed to get. But your faith, &gt;&gt; you've got so much power. &gt;&gt; You've got so much authority. There's creative life in your mouth. &gt;&gt; The creative spoken word of God that some of these folks talk about one of these glorious days when God restores the spoken word. Amazing. That happened a generation ago. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where is yours? &gt;&gt; Where is mine? &gt;&gt; It's in us. &gt;&gt; It's in us. He's working on our character. Because you can't use this power against your enemies. &gt;&gt; You've got to bless them that bless you. &gt;&gt; And you've got to bless them that curse you. &gt;&gt; And if you recognize, if I recognize sometimes what we have, &gt;&gt; there might not be a Pelosi. And if it worked everywhere, there wouldn't be a President Trump. &gt;&gt; But God didn't put this in our mouth to use it for politics &gt;&gt; or for personal agendas. &gt;&gt; He used it against principalities. He gave it to us to have authority over principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness and high places and all that ugly stuff includes the big sea. And if I live long enough to bury more saints with it, I want you to know, I'll remind you then and I'll remind you now. It's not because he's lost his power. It's not because he doesn't still heal. He's still a healer. &gt;&gt; Our yes can get mighty hard on us sometime. Revelation 3:14. under the angel of the church of the leadyans. Write these things saith. &gt;&gt; How many of you are ready for the last amen on this sermon? &gt;&gt; Go ahead. That is he is the last amen. &gt;&gt; He gets the last. So be it. &gt;&gt; But he's not only the last amen. He's not only the ending, &gt;&gt; the omega, &gt;&gt; the tav, he's also the beginning, &gt;&gt; the alpha. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The faithful and the true witness. And here's what some people miss. He is the beginning &gt;&gt; of the creation of God &gt;&gt; in the message why it had to be shepherds in that city that you've got to love and sometimes you feel a little hate too. Tucson. I love being in Tucson. I love the people of Tucson. First time I went, I thought I could never like those saros. I could never like that landscape. I like pine trees. But it grows on you. And there's something kind of spiritual and and kind of amazing to me about that Sonora desert, but it's such a religious city. Can't name very many now that wouldn't be included. Brother Brandham talked about some of it, but it was in Tucson that he said this powerful statement. He had started a new creation. What? What? What was he talking about? The beginning of the creation of God. The beginning of the creation of God. He had started a new creation. What was it? &gt;&gt; A creation of himself. Somebody said, "Oh, that sounds like a hillbilly to me." Oh, does it? It sounds like a prophetic mystic &gt;&gt; who knew the mind of God &gt;&gt; who could take the most complicated thing and say it so simple that somebody like me could get it. And the next one I don't get it at all. It's it's a mystery until it's not. Some see, some can't see. It doesn't mean that they're not good or wonderful people. Some people uh would hear the meetings, hear Brother Brandham preach, and two men went together. You've heard the story. One was so mightily impressed he said uh on the way out the door to his neighbor who went with him. I've never heard anything like that. Nor were you Renee? You were No. No. Of course. Sister West was. Is there Alfreda? Is there anybody else in here that was in a meeting of brother Brandham? You were. How old would you have been? You I won't try to figure your age. Eight. One man went out the door and he said, "I've never heard anything like that in all my life. That's the most wonderful thing I've ever heard." One man went out and said, "I've never heard anything like that in my life." I couldn't stand that. That man called me a buzzard. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The other fella said, "Oh, there's a difference. He called me an eagle." &gt;&gt; He didn't call either one of them anything. &gt;&gt; He just told it like it was. &gt;&gt; And the buzzard knew what nature he had. &gt;&gt; And the eagle must have known what nature he had. &gt;&gt; He started a new creation. What was it? A creation of himself. God was made flesh. Isn't that what John 1 tells us? John 1:1, John 1:14. Isn't that what it tells us? The Bible said in the beginning, and then right here, Revelation 3:14, in the beginning of the creation of God, God was created in human form in Jesus Christ, his son. God dwelt. He built his tabernacle of flesh and bones and lived in that tabernacle. God, Emmanuel, God with us. He built himself a house. Does anybody know that's what he's doing in 2025? &gt;&gt; Not a Moses house. &gt;&gt; Moses represented a one-man ministry. &gt;&gt; And there'll never be another one. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're a pessimist. I'm actually a realist &gt;&gt; and I've read the book &gt;&gt; and there'll never be another oneman ministry like that again. &gt;&gt; We saw it in the healing days. &gt;&gt; There'll never be another one like that again. There'll never be a major ministry patterned after that kind of one-man authority. But there will be a many membered body. &gt;&gt; You know that's what happened in the resurrection. The devil thought he won. He crucified the son of glory. Laid him there. Danced on his tomb. &gt;&gt; Thought it was over. Three days later, God raises from the dead that body &gt;&gt; now having the keys of death, hell, and the grave, been into the heart of the earth, and done the business. &gt;&gt; And some days later, at Chevot, at Pentecost, &gt;&gt; that's what I'm trying to get to. Come back tomorrow. He took the very thing that was in his son, &gt;&gt; him, &gt;&gt; and placed that on 120 &gt;&gt; same spirit, &gt;&gt; same anointing, &gt;&gt; same person, &gt;&gt; because it was the same spirit, &gt;&gt; different manifestation, same spirit. And the devil just about had a nervous breakdown &gt;&gt; because he said, "Here, we thought we defeated one Jesus and now there's at least 120 Jesus's &gt;&gt; 1965 took a ministry like William Brandom off the scene. But 2025, there's a New Testament church rising up. Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Commissioned like Joshua, &gt;&gt; many membered, &gt;&gt; generational, &gt;&gt; multi-generational, many membered, &gt;&gt; endued with the same power, &gt;&gt; same authority. Amen. &gt;&gt; I promise you when you see that operating in your life, you'll say, "It was worth it all. It was worth it all. It was worth it all to get this over with." &gt;&gt; I I I'm just going to sit down. Middle sentence. I think he built himself a house to live in it. There's a bunch of those houses here. There was once one &gt;&gt; now in my father's house. &gt;&gt; King James says man many mansions &gt;&gt; but we know that's not what it says in the original. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham told us that too. &gt;&gt; There's many what rooms. &gt;&gt; Somebody said I don't want to go to heaven to live in an apartment complex. I didn't go to heaven to live in a condominium. &gt;&gt; You You must be denominational. &gt;&gt; Because you still think it's going to be like Mr. Rogers neighborhood. &gt;&gt; That's not the house he's talking about. &gt;&gt; In my father's house, there are many rooms. There are many mansions. &gt;&gt; There are many dwelling places. &gt;&gt; My father's house is my kingdom. &gt;&gt; And look what's in my kingdom. &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe in heaven. &gt;&gt; I I I believe it's going to look beautiful. I believe it's going to be marvelous. I believe it's glorious. &gt;&gt; But I'm not just excited about that. &gt;&gt; I'm excited about this. &gt;&gt; I'm excited about these mansions. I'm excited about these houses. I'm excited about these rooms. I'm excited about what Jesus can accomplish in a quick short work &gt;&gt; that'll get the bride. She will grab the last harvest. &gt;&gt; She will. &gt;&gt; Not Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. That bride will grab the last harvest. &gt;&gt; And you know who it'll be? It'll be some of the ones you fasted for and prayed for. &gt;&gt; And God said, "I'm going to do it in my timing. &gt;&gt; I didn't bring them in when I brought you in because I didn't build them. They weren't built like you were built." &gt;&gt; When I knew you, I knew you could take it. You could come through it. &gt;&gt; You could come through the church hurt and the betrayal and even the man worship &gt;&gt; and not be polluted. &gt;&gt; But there is a people that I just let them stay right where they are until that last quick short work &gt;&gt; when the people rise up and become the houses. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what he preached? The last last of the last. What house will you build me? Here it is. Not just here. So he could Can I finish? &gt;&gt; He built his tabernacle of flesh and bones and lived in that tabernacle. God, Emanuel, God with us. He built himself a house to live in it so he could reflect so he could reflect his word to his subjects through that you know what God is &gt;&gt; when you see Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that the last of that one? When you you know what God is when you see Christ. Let me give you this one. And I'm going. Yeah, you said that before. Yeah, I mean it, too. But I mean it more now. Just give me a minute. I'm getting old. Got to find it. I got to skip ahead to get to it. You still here? &gt;&gt; Don't go leaving yet. Where did I put it? Yes, Lord. Help him find it. I got real nervous when you started praying that. Where did I put that? Oh, praise the Lord. It's Jesus that I see. The son of man revealed in you and me. And I thank God that I'm part of the family where the people are perfect as can be. Here it is. Christ is the mystery. 160 God expressed in Jesus Christ who was both father, son, and holy ghost the fullness of the Godhead bodily. Isn't that what the word said he was? &gt;&gt; Did the word not say in him dwelt the fullness &gt;&gt; of the Godhead bodily in bodily form? Yes, it did. He said, "Now the complete fullness of the Godhead bodily. &gt;&gt; I was looking for you. I heard your voice and recognized it. But I was looking for you, Liam. All that God was, he poured into Christ. in all that Christ was. &gt;&gt; That's how oneness is possible. &gt;&gt; You've already got inside of you &gt;&gt; a portion of all that he was. &gt;&gt; You don't think that can produce something? &gt;&gt; It created the world you're living on. I'm going to read this one very slow on the way back to my chair. He said, "Now the next one, things that are to be Rialto, California." If he can preach that in Rialto, California, he could preach it in Smith Station, Alabama. He said, "Now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up the age." &gt;&gt; Somebody read that next line. Oh, wait a minute. Whoa. &gt;&gt; You are &gt;&gt; the expressing. If Christ is the mystery of God revealed, &gt;&gt; then the bride must be the mystery of Christ &gt;&gt; revealed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the question is not who you are. &gt;&gt; And right now it's not really whose you are. &gt;&gt; The question is, do you know? Do you know who you are? &gt;&gt; Who are you? &gt;&gt; You are his expressing &gt;&gt; God's life in you because you are a son &gt;&gt; or a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; He said, "Therefore, you get what I mean?" &gt;&gt; Congregation says, "Don't miss your queue." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "You are now made. You're sitting in this church tonight because your duty, your duty. Would you want to do your due diligence and duty for God &gt;&gt; who gave it all for you? &gt;&gt; Sure you would. &gt;&gt; Because your duty is to express God. &gt;&gt; That broken church system will never do it. They'll try. They'll be more successful in helping make an influence over social justices than they will to do this. &gt;&gt; But there's a bride &gt;&gt; because your duty is to express God to this nation and this people and this neighborhood. &gt;&gt; Where you associate? &gt;&gt; May God help us. &gt;&gt; Put your hand right up into his presence and say, "God, help us." &gt;&gt; God help us. Help us to express what you have deposited in us. &gt;&gt; I I wouldn't have chosen me, &gt;&gt; but you knew more about me than I knew about myself. &gt;&gt; There may be some others here that wouldn't have chosen themselves, &gt;&gt; but you saw in us &gt;&gt; an eternal yes &gt;&gt; to be filled with a portion of who you are. It's more than just being a good church member. It's having the ability and the responsibility to be Christ. To be Christ, to be the anointed, to be the anointed &gt;&gt; to a sick, dying world. So you go ahead and argue over marriage and divorce. And you go ahead and argue over tunis and you go ahead and argue over whether the gift should be in the back room or not. I'm going to try to spend my time getting ready &gt;&gt; to reflect who he is &gt;&gt; even to my neighborhood. &gt;&gt; Even to my neighborhood. [Music] I love you, Lord. Oh, your mercy never fails me. All my days I've been held in your hands. From the moment that I wake up until I lay my hand, I will sing of the goodness of God. Sing that again. I love you, Lord. Oh, your mercy never fails me. And all my days, Lord, I've been held right in your hands. From the moment that I wake up until I lay my hand, oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. Oh, cuz all my life you have been faithful. Oh, and all my life you have been so so good. [Music] With every breath that I am able, I receive of the goodness of God. Cuz all my life and all my life you have been faithful. Oh, you've been faithful time and time again. And all my life you have been so, so good. Oh, with every breath that I am able. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. Lord, I love your voice. Oh, you have led me through every fire in the darkest night. Lord, you've been close like no other. See, I've known you as a father and I've known you as my very best friend. And I have lived in the good place of God. Oh, cuz all my life you have been faithful. You've been so faithful. In all my life, you have been so Lord, you've been so good. So with every breath that I am able. Oh, I will sing of the goodness. [Music] Oh, cuz all my life you have been, Lord. You've been faithful time and time again. All my life you have been. Oh my God. You've been good with every breath that I am able. I will sing of the goodness of God. Oh, cuz your goodness is running after. It's running after me. Your goodness is Oh, it keeps running after me. With my life laid down, I surrender now. I give you everything. Your goodness is Oh, it just keeps running after me. Your goodness is running after. It's running up. It just keeps running after. Your goodness is running after. It's running up to me for my life now. But surrender now. I give you everything. Your goodness is running out. Shut it up. Cuz [Music] all my life you have been faithful. [Music] And all my life you have been so so good. [Music] With every breath that I am able. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. And I love your voice. God, you have led me through the fire in the darkest night. Lord, you've been close like no other. Oh, I've known you as a father and I've known you as my friend. You see, I have lived in the goodness of God. Cuz all my life you have been faith. Oh, isn't that your testimony tonight? Oh my &gt;&gt; life you have been. My God, you in the dark times, in the lonely times that I am in the shattering times of the good. When your world was crumbling around you, you were still living in his goodness. All my life you have been faithful. You've been so faithful, Lord. Oh my all my life you have been so oh I feel so good. Oh with regret that I am able. Oh I will see the goodness of God. I can't describe what I feel. I I feel something like a promotion. We have Fort Benning out here. The wokes call it Fort Moore, but we have Fort Benning out here and it's the largest infantry training camp of the United States Army. And they're always graduating from something out there. And they have a parade field out there where they pin that promotion on the chest. In fact, Jenna, my daughter, I had have to say for some that will think I don't know my daughter's name. She is our daughter. She's the mother of our granddaughter and she's as much mine as she is her mom and daddy's because I've claimed her. She got to pin one of those awards, those promotions, those graduations on her own brother. It happens out there on a field where they brought dirt from major battlefields of the world where the American soldier fought and died. Some died. That's right. And they brought that dirt and they spread it out there on that field so that every soldier who graduates from different programs and levels, they're standing on the soil that represents generations before them. I I I I get a little emotional when I think about that. I I could feel something like that in the spirit tonight. Not just one, but I feel like there are people here who are stepping up. &gt;&gt; My That's a good feeling. It's a good feeling. &gt;&gt; It's good to feel and sense and and know that somebody's moving up. I I I I like where I I I like some of these places I've been, but my eyes are fixed on something a little higher. I I just want to keep moving up in Christ, moving up in the truth. moving up in maturity, &gt;&gt; moving up into the stature of the perfect man. &gt;&gt; And I could just feel that pleasure of the Lord over this house. Will you say yes to him right now? &gt;&gt; Would you just commit? &gt;&gt; I'll follow your voice. I'll follow your leading. &gt;&gt; I'll go deeper. I'll go higher. I'll yield more. I'm determined to give up more of my rights. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And do your will. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I'm not a preacher." I'm not just talking to preachers. &gt;&gt; I'm talking to mamas with baskets full of babies at Walmart. And I'm talking to men who work beside men on their job. And I'm talking to people who have connections and acquaintances all over this community and wherever you're from. Would you ask the Lord to give you another installment of boldness and courage? Not to be religious, &gt;&gt; but to be light. Let the anointing that I know is not a feeling but the presence the the the very reality of the Christ. May that increase in my life. Somebody's been listening too much to what you think people think. Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you trained to do that? &gt;&gt; Have you been to school to study all that stuff? Then tell the devil he's a liar. &gt;&gt; Quit trying to figure out what somebody thinks about you. Quit thinking on what you think somebody thinks. &gt;&gt; And be filled with the anointing. be filled with greater determination at greater levels of faith and courage and strength. Be filled with more of who he is. [Music] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, may God give you new territory. May he expand the sphere of your influence as he filled you &gt;&gt; with more of who he is for this end time plan. &gt;&gt; There is an end time anointing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To finish this end time plan. &gt;&gt; And it's not a feeling. &gt;&gt; It's him. Raise your hand if you feel like you need something from him right now. &gt;&gt; He's prepared your heart and positioned you right now to receive something from him. Nobody's screaming over you and telling you what to feel or think. Soak be a sponge. More of your Lord, more of your anointing, more of your strength, more of your courage, more faith, more faith, anointed faith. Oh God, meet me in my living room. Meet me in my hallway. Meet me in my basement. Meet me in my she-shed. Meet me in my man cave. meet me. &gt;&gt; Let every place I go be a tabernacle. Let every place I go be a pavilion. Let every place I go be a place where your glory can meet with me. Oh, I feel something here. Break off, Lord. break off the residue, &gt;&gt; the residual junk from my journey. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you heard that masterpiece that R.J. was preaching last night. But when God gave me that Zechariah 3 experience, I saw that dirty turban said, "Remove that dirty turban." And the turban was what covered the mind, the head of the priesthood. I'm going to take the residue of Babylonian captivity out of your thoughts. &gt;&gt; I'm going to take, that's what he was saying. I'm going to take some of those hurt things that you have have struggled to get above, but it keeps permeating your mind. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I I I don't want to be carnal, but there are more people in this room that have multiple levels of PTSD that have never been diagnosed because of the trauma and things that you've experienced on this journey. And even though it's a part of your story and a part of your journey, it is not to be dominant in your thought processes and paradigms moving forward. Oh God, give me grace. give you grace to see that that dirty turban that represents the captivity of Babylon, let it be snatched, unwound from my head, and a new fair miter, a new holy miter be placed on my head that screams holiness unto the Lord. Holiness unto the Lord, holiness unto the Lord. How many of you want your life, you want your life to say holiness unto the Lord, set apart unto the Lord, sanctified unto the Lord, separated to the glory of God. &gt;&gt; He called you for that. If you're here and you feel like you're still carrying some uh religious mindsets that are more like denominational things than the word. Somebody say, "Well, that's the way I was raised." Well, will that be your will that be your ceiling or will that be your floor? Why don't we just make where we were raised and what we were Why don't we make that our floor, &gt;&gt; the good, bad, and the ugly. And why don't we say, "I'm not staying where I was raised. &gt;&gt; I'm going higher. &gt;&gt; I'm not going back, &gt;&gt; but I'm going higher." It it's the mark of spiritual fatherhood &gt;&gt; and motherhood to want to impart &gt;&gt; to your children natural or spiritual enough that they don't have to start where you started. &gt;&gt; But they pick up where you're leaving off and they go higher. &gt;&gt; And I grew up in a generation where some of the old-timers said, "Ha, let them pay the price I paid." And I've even felt that way a time or two. But when that spiritual fatherhood thing begins to come on you, you say, "Lord, spare them." &gt;&gt; I learned it. I went through it. I had it. They shouldn't have to. Let me do something to help them get above. &gt;&gt; How many of you like to get above &gt;&gt; some of the things you're still &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel that. I'm going to sit down. I'm not preaching now. You can't count this as preaching. &gt;&gt; I would love to see the Lord just, [Music] you know, that turban wraps and wraps and wraps and wraps and wraps. You You'd probably look like a top if that thing started coming off of you. years and years of stuff that happened to you really to promote you. But the enemy's tried to make it your lifelong identity. You are not identified by where you've been or what you've been through. &gt;&gt; You are identified as a part of the new creation of God. New mindsets, &gt;&gt; new clean turbons, &gt;&gt; new thoughts and holy thoughts and clean thoughts and hopeful thoughts. [Music] thoughts that are not pessimistic &gt;&gt; and defeated and orphan &gt;&gt; and forsaken &gt;&gt; but confident. &gt;&gt; I'm going to answer the call not like Adam and Eve shaking in the woods. I'm going to answer the call like Adam answered the first call. I'm here, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's take our walk. &gt;&gt; And he would have always done it just like that had he not started mixing truth and life. As soon as that other side of knowledge was discovered, &gt;&gt; you should see it this way. Adam was created to only know that which was good, that which was to in Hebrew, and righteous and upright and holy. But that that tree and what happened in that garden represented the knowledge of the other side. And what we have today is a generation that's more acquainted with the dark side, &gt;&gt; not the knowledge of good. They're more acquainted with the knowledge of evil. &gt;&gt; And they live out of that. &gt;&gt; You don't have to. &gt;&gt; You've been redeemed out of that. Why don't you take a big old bite uh from the tree of life? Because the chariot beam that once guarded the way and wouldn't let us back, they're still active. &gt;&gt; They've still got flaming sword, &gt;&gt; but they're not trying to keep you out anymore. They're trying to help us get coraled, gathered up &gt;&gt; so that we can go back to that place &gt;&gt; and know what it's about. May we have a taste. It would have been terrible if Adam and Eve could have made their way back to that tree after their bodies had already been under the curse. and they would have had to live eternally in a fallen body and that was not your plan. You kept them out and now you invite us in. Anybody follow that? &gt;&gt; Lord, we're taking a bite of your goodness tonight. Loose us. I I didn't hear that. I said loose us. What I heard what I heard in the spirit was what we heard last night, wasn't it? Loose thyself. &gt;&gt; Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; Oh captive daughter of Zion, it's a farce. &gt;&gt; The bonds around your neck &gt;&gt; are opened. You've already been set free. &gt;&gt; All you have to do is reach up and cast them off. Loose thyself. [Music] The price has already been paid. &gt;&gt; You don't have to have 30 years of deliverance ministry. You don't have to repent back 112 generations. &gt;&gt; All you have to do is recognize that the key has been to put in the lock. And the only reason why you're not free, I'm not free, is because we're like that old bear. &gt;&gt; That we saw last night. We were in the cage so long. We can only &gt;&gt; free. &gt;&gt; Tell him right now, I want to be free. &gt;&gt; Little more of that and let's go. [Music] &gt;&gt; Somebody told me there were biscuits and gravy. Let's hurry now. All my life you have been faithful. [Music] And all my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God.
