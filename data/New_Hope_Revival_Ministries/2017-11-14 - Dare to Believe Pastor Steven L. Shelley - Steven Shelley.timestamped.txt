[0:02] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley I'm
[0:05] coming to you from New Hope revival
[0:07] ministries in Smith Station Alabama us
[0:12] of a and we're coming to you for the
[0:15] gospel channel our great partners and
[0:18] Friends I am so thankful for the
[0:22] relationship that the Lord has given us
[0:24] with brother Eric Erickson and the staff
[0:27] of the gospel channel also Omega
[0:30] television Omega television throughout
[0:33] the island of Iceland and then the
[0:36] gospel channel reaching into the far
[0:39] ends of the earth with the gospel of
[0:42] Jesus Christ with the good news I'm
[0:45] coming to you from our brand-new studio
[0:48] we are so thankful to the Lord for the
[0:51] way that he has provided it came
[0:54] supernaturally it came by faith one step
[0:58] at a time but God has provided the need
[1:01] and we were so blessed a few short weeks
[1:04] ago to have your founder and director
[1:07] brother Eric Erickson come to Alabama to
[1:11] dedicate this studio with us during our
[1:15] international camp meeting and I tell
[1:17] you I can get a little teary-eyed
[1:19] thinking about the presence of the Lord
[1:21] that filled this little church and
[1:24] filled this studio and we just have so
[1:26] much to be thankful for and now God is
[1:29] giving us this opportunity to speak to
[1:31] you all across the UK and wherever you
[1:34] might be watching this program we
[1:37] believe that exciting days are ahead for
[1:40] the Ministry of Jesus Christ and we
[1:43] think that exciting days are ahead for
[1:45] the gospel channel and so we want to
[1:47] encourage you to continue to stand with
[1:50] them partner with them financially and
[1:53] with your prayers don't ever
[1:55] underestimate the power of prayer they
[1:59] need you to stand with them agree that
[2:03] God will continue to provide for every
[2:06] need you know I want to mention that
[2:09] that Christian television is not cheap
[2:12] it's not free and they have to pay for
[2:14] the airtime for the satellite time to
[2:17] get the gospel to you and if you are
[2:20] blessed by the programs here on the
[2:23] gospel channel then I want you to
[2:25] partner with us first and foremost in
[2:27] prayer but also with your finances
[2:30] because I believe that it is good soil
[2:33] and I feel that in the next season
[2:35] you're going to see some things
[2:39] increasing the anointing increasing and
[2:42] the outreach increasing and I think
[2:44] you're gonna feel very blessed to have
[2:47] been a part of the gospel channel during
[2:49] this last season standing with them in
[2:52] faith and in prayer you know faith is
[2:55] one of the things I want to talk to you
[2:56] about today in order to do that I'm
[3:00] gonna have to be a little bit
[3:01] transparent and I hope you'll allow me
[3:04] to do that but I'm going to share with
[3:07] you something that's kind of been
[3:09] happening in our local assembly our
[3:11] local church and I'm doing that because
[3:15] I feel that it is not just a word for us
[3:20] for new hope revival ministries or for
[3:23] Alabama or even the US I I feel like
[3:27] it's a message of encouragement to the
[3:30] Bride of Christ to the people of God
[3:32] wherever you may be we see a lot going
[3:36] on around us and we know that we're
[3:39] living in in troubled times the Bible
[3:41] speaks of perilous times well this is
[3:44] perilous times but there's never been a
[3:47] more appropriate time or a more needed
[3:52] time than today for the people of God to
[3:56] rise up in faith and begin to exercise
[3:59] the authority that God has given us to
[4:03] bring the kingdom of God into further
[4:07] advancement this is that hour I know
[4:10] people will often say you know evil is
[4:13] increasing and darkness gross darkness
[4:16] is covering the earth that's what the
[4:17] Bible said but it also says that in a
[4:20] moment like that it's
[4:21] for you and I to arise and shine and let
[4:26] the light of Jesus Christ Yeshua our
[4:28] Messiah emanate from our lives from our
[4:32] personal lives you know I believe that
[4:34] Christian television isn't and is a very
[4:37] effective media to encourage the people
[4:41] of God it's not only a tool for
[4:43] evangelism to reach the lost but if we
[4:46] can find you right where you are maybe
[4:50] you're a little discouraged maybe you've
[4:52] experienced some Hope deferred you've
[4:54] had some promises from God and it looks
[4:57] like that they're just never gonna come
[4:59] you know they are but you're weary and
[5:02] waiting and you're discouraged you know
[5:05] all of us get discouraged at times it's
[5:09] not something I particularly enjoy
[5:11] talking about but it is reality
[5:14] and where do I find my encouragement
[5:16] when I get in that place look there's
[5:19] only one place to find it and that's
[5:20] from the Lord it's from his word it's
[5:24] from those moments of private personal
[5:28] worship it's in those moments where we
[5:31] can find that place of quietness to just
[5:34] lean on his shoulder and let him love on
[5:37] us and maybe you're watching this and
[5:39] you've never experienced that reality
[5:41] it's available it's available if there's
[5:45] something in your life that's standing
[5:47] in the way of you having that intimate
[5:50] relationship with Jesus Christ now would
[5:53] be a good time to get that under the
[5:55] blood to repent to say Lord forgive me
[5:58] have mercy on me you know I'm finding
[6:01] that the Lord is a very patient father
[6:03] I'm finding that he is good and that His
[6:07] grace is sufficient for all of our needs
[6:10] and so what I wanted to say is Christian
[6:14] television is not just about reaching
[6:16] the lost we feel that if we can
[6:18] encourage you as a believer if we can
[6:21] encourage you in your daily walk with
[6:24] Jesus Christ then you're going to have
[6:26] the passion restored you're gonna have
[6:29] your fire lit you're gonna be
[6:32] be desirous to go out you're gonna
[6:34] you're gonna feel the function of the
[6:36] Lord again to go out and just live the
[6:39] God life in front of other people
[6:42] I really believe that's going to be one
[6:44] of the ways that the final harvest is
[6:46] brought in one on one your life making a
[6:51] difference pointing people to Jesus
[6:53] Christ so that's going to be what what
[6:56] we desire to do with the studio that the
[6:58] Lord has given us we come to you weekly
[7:02] on our regular broadcast of the Eagles
[7:04] cry and from time to time we're going to
[7:06] be setting in for brother Eric Erickson
[7:09] and for the staff at gospel channel and
[7:11] we look forward to a day that we're
[7:13] going to be able to come to you live
[7:15] from Alabama all across the UK and
[7:18] around the world and we're getting ready
[7:20] for that we're getting geared up for
[7:22] that because we want to partner with
[7:24] them not just for the reaching of the
[7:26] Lost but also to encourage the
[7:29] discouraged because I really believe
[7:32] that so much is going to be accomplished
[7:35] in the kingdom of God in this last day
[7:37] by just one on one
[7:40] living the life in front of each other
[7:43] finding community finding your tribe
[7:46] finding those who are going through what
[7:48] you're going through and one of the ways
[7:51] we do that is by being transparent you
[7:53] know sometimes in the body of Christ we
[7:55] pretend to be superheroes who who never
[7:59] go through trouble who never go through
[8:01] moments of doubt who never have
[8:03] questions why don't we just get real why
[8:07] don't we just be real in this last hour
[8:10] just where the rubber meets the road so
[8:14] to speak drop the facade and just cry
[8:17] out to the Lord I'm hurting I'm in need
[8:19] I'm a little discouraged I'm a little
[8:22] disappointed and I need your help and
[8:24] then sharing it with others there must
[8:27] be somebody somewhere in your life and
[8:29] your community in your church that you
[8:32] can just be transparent with and if not
[8:35] I'm gonna pray that the Lord will lead
[8:36] you to somebody I was recently in a
[8:39] meeting with a family a large family
[8:43] and we were talking about the struggles
[8:46] of life and the pressures of life and it
[8:49] was a moment of honesty and we went
[8:51] around the room this family blood blood
[8:54] relatives and we went around the room
[8:56] and began to speak our struggles what we
[8:59] were going through some of our past what
[9:01] we were fighting what our temptations
[9:04] were and you would be surprised that in
[9:07] a blood family some of them living in
[9:10] the same home they were able to express
[9:13] the same troubles the same temptations
[9:15] the same battles and it was like a light
[9:18] bulb was coming on in their in their
[9:20] head Hey huh I'm not by myself you know
[9:24] the enemy takes advantage of isolation
[9:27] and he was telling some of those young
[9:29] men you're bad you know you should never
[9:32] have thoughts like this this should
[9:35] never be going on and because they
[9:37] thought they were the only one in the
[9:38] family maybe the only one in the church
[9:40] community going through those kinds of
[9:42] things the enemy takes advantage of that
[9:45] isolation and he accuses and he
[9:47] intimidates and he seeks to destroy so
[9:50] honesty that night was the key just
[9:53] finding someone that you can be real
[9:55] with I'm gonna try to be real with you
[9:58] every time I come whether it's here
[10:00] representing the gospel channel or
[10:02] whether it's the Eagles cry or any other
[10:05] programs that we may produce I don't
[10:08] have a huge reputation to maintain
[10:10] I just want to be real and I want you to
[10:13] know that your struggles matter to God
[10:15] and if you can believe it they matter to
[10:18] us and that's why we're doing what we're
[10:20] doing in fact I believe that's why
[10:22] brother Eric Erickson is doing what he's
[10:24] doing if we ever had any ambitions of
[10:27] fame or popularity we gave up on those
[10:30] many many years ago I just want to be a
[10:33] friend of the bridegroom I just want to
[10:35] be somebody to help encourage the Bride
[10:38] of Christ and so that's what this
[10:39] program today is about I said a moment
[10:43] ago in order to share what I feel like
[10:45] the Lord would have me to share today I
[10:47] would have to be a little transparent
[10:49] about our own church community and I'm
[10:51] going to do that in just a moment but
[10:53] let me invite you to call the number on
[10:55] your screen
[10:57] contact the gospel channel contact New
[11:00] Hope revival ministries and we will pray
[11:03] with you we want to know about your need
[11:06] we believe in the power of agreement we
[11:08] believe in the power of corporate prayer
[11:11] we know it's very very important to the
[11:13] overcoming Christian life to have a
[11:16] personal individual prayer life
[11:19] something that you develop through the
[11:22] years of how you can communicate with
[11:25] your loving father and that doesn't
[11:27] always look exactly the same for
[11:30] everybody but however you can find that
[11:33] place where you can sense that the Lord
[11:37] is listening where you can position
[11:39] yourself to hear his voice that personal
[11:43] prayer life is vitally important always
[11:46] has been but it is particularly
[11:49] important in the hour that we're living
[11:52] in right now but with that we get the
[11:55] benefit of joining together in prayer
[11:58] and that's what we want to do new hope
[12:01] revival ministries wants to stand with
[12:03] you agree with you over your prayer
[12:06] needs and then we want to hear when God
[12:09] begins to move we found out a long time
[12:12] ago that sometimes we have to give God
[12:14] praise when we see the mountain moving
[12:16] just a little bit we start saying thank
[12:19] you Lord there's hope in sight and each
[12:22] time the mountain moves a little farther
[12:24] and farther in the right direction we
[12:26] just keep on giving God praise until
[12:29] faith rises to the level that we can
[12:31] fulfill the words of our Lord speak to
[12:34] the mountain and watch it move a few
[12:37] weeks ago
[12:38] the Lord began to deal with us
[12:41] concerning the issue of unbelief we as a
[12:44] ministry for many many years since 1990
[12:48] we started receiving really spectacular
[12:52] promises from the Lord by the prophetic
[12:55] gifts God was really speaking to us
[12:59] using many different people in many
[13:02] different gifted ways some were little
[13:06] grannies who God would use to give an
[13:09] utterance
[13:10] and tongues and yes that's still a part
[13:13] of God's New Testament plan the gifts of
[13:17] tongues and interpretation someone else
[13:20] would rise up with an interpretation but
[13:22] in the end it was God who was speaking
[13:25] to his people the Lord would deal with
[13:28] us in visions and dreams and because of
[13:31] a faithful staff those prophetic
[13:33] promises were chronicled they were
[13:36] recorded
[13:37] they were typed out transcribed you
[13:41] might laugh - to realize that we as a
[13:44] ministry since the early 90s have a copy
[13:47] some form cassette cd/dvd old VHS tape
[13:54] of almost every service that we have had
[13:57] in these past how many years would that
[14:00] be a lot because we not so much because
[14:04] we thought that every word was the Lord
[14:07] that every word every sermon that
[14:11] everything that happened in the course
[14:13] of a service a prayer request or or what
[14:16] a baby crying we didn't think that it
[14:18] was all sacred but in order to find what
[14:21] was sacred in order to hold on to what
[14:23] was sacred we knew that we would just
[14:25] have to somehow gather and guard and
[14:28] protect it all and that's what we've
[14:29] done
[14:30] that's the positive the negative is
[14:33] sometimes when you're dealing with with
[14:36] church life with problems that can arise
[14:39] when people butt heads and we've had
[14:43] some some head-butting through the years
[14:45] we've had some disappointments we've had
[14:49] some betrayals but we've had some
[14:51] amazing miracles as well sometimes in
[14:55] your mind you're trying to balance it
[14:56] all out and you just get weary the Bible
[15:00] talks about being weary that we should
[15:02] not be weary in well-doing for we will
[15:05] reap in due season if we faint not well
[15:08] I confess to you that I fainted
[15:11] spiritually I fainted before exhaustion
[15:15] mentally and emotionally
[15:18] you just get drain
[15:19] some time giving everything you have to
[15:22] give and and sometimes more than you
[15:24] have to give and what what happens is
[15:27] your hope becomes a little deferred your
[15:30] heart gets a little bit sick and you
[15:33] begin to wonder I guess I never really
[15:36] wondered if God was going to do what he
[15:38] said because he's proven that to me in
[15:41] all the years of ministry some of you
[15:43] might remember my testimony I received
[15:45] the baptism of the holy ghost in 1975
[15:48] and began a public ministry that has
[15:51] spanned the entire time from 1975 to the
[15:55] present and I've seen God do some
[15:58] outstanding things ranging from the
[16:00] healing of cancer to to even the racing
[16:03] of the dead I know that God is faithful
[16:06] I know that he has proven to me through
[16:08] the years that his word is yay and a man
[16:10] but I'll tell you where I fainted
[16:13] I fainted in this in this particular
[16:15] area of of wandering at times is it
[16:19] worth all the trouble
[16:21] I almost said my original thought and
[16:24] what I said to my congregation not sure
[16:26] that I can get by was saying it on here
[16:29] but I think I might I wondered if it was
[16:31] worth all the hell all the darkness that
[16:35] you have to go through the battle that
[16:36] you have to fight the everyday grind to
[16:39] get to that point I mean it's obvious
[16:42] that in those early years when God began
[16:44] to speak to us about his plans how we
[16:46] wanted to use us for for bringing
[16:49] deliverance to others and and miracles
[16:52] by the spoken word etc and how God was
[16:55] going to help us develop the property
[16:57] that we have and how we were going to
[16:58] reach out to the nation's all these big
[17:01] promises that God had made and so at
[17:04] times I felt almost like giving up not
[17:09] on God really but I wondered if if the
[17:13] battle was was worth if the victory in
[17:17] the end was worth the everyday battle if
[17:19] if enduring daily
[17:22] attack and whatever we go through in
[17:25] life was really worth it all in the end
[17:28] when you begin to see God do what he was
[17:30] even as ice
[17:32] say and I feel I feel I feel kind of
[17:34] dumb saying it but I'm telling you that
[17:38] when you get to that place of weakness
[17:40] you can say and think all kinds of crazy
[17:43] things things that you know better and
[17:45] then when you repeat them later you how
[17:47] did I ever think something like that but
[17:50] that's where I failed I came to this
[17:52] place where I just wondered is the is
[17:54] the daily grind going to be in the end
[17:56] is it going to be worth the daily grind
[17:58] is the victory in the end going to be
[18:00] worth the daily battle I'm telling you
[18:02] it is I'm telling you that it is worth
[18:05] it God used a very precious friend of
[18:09] ours some of you know the life and
[18:12] ministry of Paul Keith Davis and God
[18:15] used him in a particular way in the
[18:18] summer time of this year my son was
[18:21] graduating from home school and he came
[18:24] as a real favor a real gesture of love
[18:28] to our family he came to speak at
[18:30] Benjamin Judah's graduation it meant a
[18:33] lot to us and it particularly meant a
[18:35] lot to Benjamin he agreed to stay over
[18:37] for the Sunday morning service and he
[18:39] began to speak to us and he began to
[18:42] talk to us about things that were
[18:43] happening in his life and how details
[18:45] were lining up and confirmations were
[18:48] coming and I personally know some of the
[18:50] battles that he has gone through in the
[18:52] last few years and and I know that at
[18:55] times his hope has been deferred and and
[18:58] his heart has been sad and he's bent
[19:00] almost to the place of wondering if it
[19:03] was all going to be worth it in the end
[19:04] as well but he began to put all those
[19:07] things together and and at the end of
[19:09] that he spoke about an experience that I
[19:12] had had with the Lord
[19:14] 10 years ago on that particular day 10
[19:18] years ago today that was I was by shock
[19:23] I'm not my memory doesn't always work
[19:26] that way and I had no idea that this was
[19:29] the 10 year anniversary of an experience
[19:32] that I had had with the Lord where he
[19:33] promised that he was going to deal with
[19:36] the areas of strongholds in people's
[19:39] lives that we could enjoy a freedom in
[19:42] our church community
[19:44] across our state and by the grace of God
[19:47] around the world nathie the Lord was
[19:50] gonna deal with strongholds that had
[19:52] been keeping people batten we find that
[19:55] strongholds are generally mindsets that
[19:59] we get hung end stuck in and it takes
[20:03] the Lord it takes something happening to
[20:05] shake us to cause us to awaken so that
[20:09] we can get those strongholds pulled down
[20:11] in the authority of Jesus Christ and
[20:14] move forward in in faith and in belief
[20:16] so I just heard the Lord I don't know
[20:20] how to describe it I just heard the lord
[20:22] as paul keith was speaking i heard the
[20:25] lord saying this is me the lord building
[20:29] my case it really strengthened me the
[20:33] lord was laying out his faithfulness
[20:35] through the past he was showing us
[20:39] confirmations and letting us know it's
[20:42] worth holding on just a little bit
[20:44] longer can I tell you if you're
[20:47] considering giving up if you're
[20:50] wondering if you're gonna be able to
[20:52] endure to the last battle so that the
[20:54] victory that God has promised you and
[20:56] your individual life can come and you're
[20:58] wondering now if I'm really gonna be
[21:00] able to hold on to the end
[21:01] let me pass by your way today and tell
[21:04] you hold on just a little bit longer
[21:07] because God may be using this delay to
[21:10] deal with something in your life that
[21:12] you may not be completely aware of and
[21:15] that's that measure of unbelief that can
[21:18] grow in you through the years of
[21:21] disappointments I want to read a
[21:23] scripture to you before I move on any
[21:26] further is found in the book of Mark in
[21:28] the Gospel of Mark chapter 9 beginning
[21:31] in verse 14 and it talks about a man
[21:35] whose son was in a pitiful condition and
[21:38] so he came to the Lord in verse 14 and
[21:42] when he came to his disciples he saw a
[21:44] great multitude about them and the
[21:46] scribes questioning with them and
[21:49] straightway all the people when they
[21:52] beheld him were greatly amazed and
[21:55] running to him so
[21:57] him and he asked the scribes what
[22:00] question you with them and one of the
[22:02] multitude answered and said master I
[22:04] have brought unto thee my son which hath
[22:08] a dumb spirit and wheresoever he taketh
[22:11] him he tarath him and he fo myth and
[22:13] nashit with his teeth and pine it away
[22:16] and I speak to thy disciples that they
[22:19] should cast him out and they could not
[22:22] he answered them him and saith o
[22:25] faithless generation how long shall I be
[22:29] with you how long shall I suffer you
[22:31] bring him unto me and they brought him
[22:35] unto Him and when he saw him straightway
[22:38] the spirit tear him and he fell on the
[22:41] ground and wallowed foaming and he asked
[22:44] his father how long is it a ghost since
[22:47] this came unto Him and he said of a
[22:51] child and oftentimes it hath cast him
[22:54] into the fire and into the waters to
[22:56] destroy him but if thou canst do
[22:59] anything have compassion on us and help
[23:02] us jesus saith unto him if thou canst
[23:10] believe all things are possible to him
[23:15] that believeth and this next verse is an
[23:20] important part of this story it's it's a
[23:24] true story I believe I don't believe
[23:26] this is a parable I don't believe this
[23:28] is an allegory
[23:29] I believe this day really happened
[23:32] that a father brought his son seemingly
[23:37] possessed by some kind of spirit
[23:40] manifesting in in physical demonstration
[23:44] seizures of some kind foaming at the
[23:48] mouth so severe that the boy would both
[23:52] fall into fire and water driven by some
[23:56] unseen force a force that desired not to
[24:01] just crippled that boy it desired to
[24:04] destroy his life this father and
[24:07] desperation brought his son
[24:09] to the disciples of the Lord maybe not
[24:11] wanting to bother the Lord and assuming
[24:13] these men are with him perhaps they have
[24:16] the same power he does but they were not
[24:19] able to do anything about this spirit
[24:21] that was tearing this little lad and so
[24:24] to Jesus the dad reached out I like this
[24:28] the way he said this request I like the
[24:32] way he worded his his petition here he
[24:35] said if you can do anything if thou
[24:39] canst do anything have compassion on us
[24:42] and help us I'm not sure that sounded
[24:45] like a real determined faith but it was
[24:49] enough to get the Lord's attention
[24:50] because then Jesus said if you can
[24:53] believe all things are possible to him
[24:54] that believeth but this next verse is
[24:57] where I've been in my life at times it's
[25:00] where you may be right now it's where we
[25:03] were as a church community and
[25:05] straightway the father of the child
[25:07] cried out and said with tears lord I
[25:10] believe help thou my unbelief this is a
[25:18] powerful prayer I've actually heard
[25:21] sermons through the years criticizing
[25:24] this man for not being able to muster
[25:26] enough faith but this man knew that
[25:30] there was unbelief present he knew there
[25:33] was discouragement present in his life
[25:35] he knew that he had been to the point of
[25:38] giving up concerning his own son
[25:41] wondering if there would ever be
[25:43] deliverance if there would ever be
[25:45] healing or if things would always be as
[25:48] they had always been so in this very
[25:52] transparent moment he prayed one of the
[25:54] most powerful prayers that any of us
[25:57] could pray today lord I believe help
[26:00] thou my unbelief
[26:04] for some reason it reminds me of the
[26:07] prayer that the Lord prayed in the
[26:08] Garden of Gethsemane the Olive Press
[26:12] Gethsemane means the Olive Press the
[26:15] place where the olives or the grapes are
[26:18] squeezed until the life until the oil
[26:21] until the juice
[26:23] extracted our Lord was praying in his
[26:26] olive press there was a life in him that
[26:30] needed to be pressed out so that you and
[26:34] I could receive that same life as a gift
[26:38] even as the disciples received it on the
[26:41] day of Pentecost by the baptism of the
[26:43] Holy Spirit you and I can receive that
[26:46] same life that was squeezed out of our
[26:48] Lord in that moment of temptation in
[26:51] that moment where it would have been
[26:53] easy to forsake the Father's will
[26:56] he prayed a prayer like this Oh father
[26:59] if it be possible let this cup pass from
[27:03] me if that was the end of a story it
[27:07] would have been dark and it would have
[27:09] been disappointing but it's not the end
[27:12] of the story not by any means
[27:15] he prayed with the most powerful word
[27:19] he prayed nevertheless this is how I'm
[27:23] feeling Lord I'm feeling like Oh father
[27:26] that I'd like for this cup to pass I'd
[27:30] like for things to be different now but
[27:34] he didn't stop asking the Lord to do it
[27:37] his way his father to do it his way he
[27:41] continued nevertheless not my will but
[27:45] your will by will be done this was a
[27:49] moment when our Lord confessed that his
[27:52] spirit was willing but his flesh was
[27:55] weak my mind makes a connection with
[27:59] these two prayers this man was
[28:02] completely honest I do believe Lord help
[28:07] my unbelief he became so aware by the
[28:11] words of our Lord that convicted his
[28:14] heart there is a measure of unbelief
[28:17] present in me our church community after
[28:21] all the years of waiting now we've seen
[28:23] God do continuously beautiful things
[28:27] leaving a service very very encouraged
[28:31] but not the full reality of what we are
[28:34] expecting the Lord too
[28:36] and it's the journey it's the process
[28:39] it's the molding and the shaping and all
[28:42] of that can make us a little bit weary
[28:43] and I feel like somebody is watching
[28:46] this program today and you know exactly
[28:49] what I'm talking about because you've
[28:52] been made weary by the everyday pressure
[28:56] of the potter's wheel sometimes God puts
[29:00] us together so that we can bump up
[29:02] against each other and knock off those
[29:04] rough edges and I have to be honest with
[29:08] you there's more to come there's going
[29:11] to be some more knocking around there's
[29:13] going to be some more pressure on the
[29:15] potter's wheel there's gonna be some
[29:17] more fire in your life but I believe
[29:20] that if we can come to this place where
[29:22] we just get really real with the Lord
[29:24] why wouldn't we be he already knows our
[29:26] heart I hope you know by now that he
[29:29] doesn't just listen to the words of our
[29:31] mouth he knows our heart his word is so
[29:35] powerful and so quick and so discerning
[29:38] that it's able to go right down into
[29:41] that separation of soul and spirit the
[29:45] soul being made up of mind will and
[29:47] emotions and I don't know about you but
[29:49] that's where my battle is that's where
[29:51] my thoughts are and so sometimes in my
[29:55] spirit that which has been renewed and
[29:59] regenerated by the Spirit of life that
[30:01] flows from Jesus Christ my spirit cries
[30:04] out Lord I believe but then there's that
[30:09] other voice the voice that comes from my
[30:12] mind and from my will and from my
[30:14] emotions and it says but I'm tired of
[30:16] waiting
[30:17] I'm tired of waiting is it ever gonna be
[30:20] and so what I believe the Lord wants us
[30:23] to do across the land across the world
[30:26] the body of Christ we need to be honest
[30:29] about that measure of unbelief that's
[30:31] creeping up in our inner soul in our
[30:34] mind and in our will our thoughts our
[30:36] emotions we need to be honest about it
[30:38] not try to hide it we need to give it to
[30:41] the Lord so right where you are I'm
[30:43] inviting you before we leave the air in
[30:46] a few moments I'm inviting you to
[30:48] be honest do to be real before the Lord
[30:50] and pray even as we have prayed as a
[30:53] community New Hope revival ministries
[30:55] and and I've prayed as an individual in
[30:58] fact I've prayed it every day since God
[31:01] made it real to me not once actually
[31:04] dozens of times I was combing my hair
[31:08] this morning and I was talking to the
[31:10] Lord Lord I believe help thou my
[31:14] unbelief and for me it feels so good to
[31:17] say it it feels so good
[31:19] to be honest I know that unbelief is is
[31:22] sin I know that God is not pleased with
[31:25] unbelief but I also know that he's a
[31:27] good father
[31:28] and I also know that the only way that I
[31:31] can get that unbelief taken care of by
[31:33] repentance and getting it under the
[31:35] blood and covered by his love is to
[31:38] admit that sometimes that weariness that
[31:42] tiredness of waiting on the promises of
[31:44] God can actually become unbelief and I
[31:48] believe that unbelief is probably the
[31:50] only thing that can keep God from moving
[31:52] in your life in my life to the fullest
[31:56] potential of his power I remember
[31:58] hearing a preacher say many many years
[32:00] ago when I was a small boy that doubt
[32:03] and unbelief in essence tied the hands
[32:06] of God
[32:07] well I guess I believe that there are
[32:10] times that his love for me his belief in
[32:15] me has had to override or overwrite that
[32:20] little unbelief that was within me
[32:23] because I've seen God move in times that
[32:26] I had to stand back and say that wasn't
[32:28] my faith that wasn't my prayer that
[32:30] moved God that way I saw God move and I
[32:34] saw the results of his moving but I knew
[32:37] that it was not my faith that did it
[32:39] that was grace because God sees your
[32:43] heart he knows the intent of your heart
[32:45] he knows the love that you have for him
[32:47] if indeed you do and when that unbelief
[32:50] creeps up it must be disappointing to
[32:52] him it must have been disappointing when
[32:55] this man came and listened this man was
[32:57] he received further discord
[32:59] Richmond because now the disciples can't
[33:01] do anything about it no wonder in
[33:03] exasperation he finally said Lord if you
[33:05] can do anything about it
[33:06] I sure would appreciate you doing it
[33:09] Jesus wanted to help but he oh boy he
[33:13] wanted to see the boy delivered and set
[33:15] free there's no doubt about it but he
[33:17] also wanted to help the father because
[33:20] this situation was not the only
[33:22] situation that that man was going to
[33:24] face in the rest of his life here on
[33:26] earth and jesus yeshua wanted to help
[33:29] him overcome that nagging gnawing
[33:32] unbelief because if we don't deal with
[33:35] it it doesn't go away and it doesn't
[33:38] shrink in fact it multiplies and it
[33:42] grows until like weeds like tears it
[33:46] chokes out the good seed i believe God
[33:49] has given us authority in our community
[33:52] to deal with unbelief in fact we've been
[33:54] declaring every service corporately our
[33:58] season of unbelief has ended in reality
[34:04] I can't say that in the past few weeks I
[34:06] haven't had my doubts I can't say that I
[34:10] haven't had those moments of reflecting
[34:13] back to my old thought patterns but I
[34:16] can tell you this by making that
[34:18] declaration by praying by speaking many
[34:21] times over the course of a day lord I
[34:23] believe help thou my unbelief those
[34:26] moments of doubt those thoughts of
[34:28] unbelief those thoughts of weariness and
[34:31] discouragement they're lasting shorter
[34:35] and shorter the the the duration of them
[34:38] now it's down to a few seconds we're in
[34:42] times past it could have been the
[34:44] discouragement of a whole day I could
[34:46] have spent the whole day depressed and
[34:48] you know exactly what I'm talking about
[34:50] I know there may be some who are
[34:53] brushing this off as though it couldn't
[34:55] possibly relate to their life but I'm
[34:57] talking I'm speaking to someone right
[35:00] now who knows exactly how it feels to
[35:03] love the Lord with your whole heart not
[35:06] you the desire you have this desire not
[35:08] to ever be disappointed in him
[35:10] and yet struggling with the
[35:13] fact that you're not seeing the results
[35:14] that you feel like he promised and so
[35:18] this word this moment is for you right
[35:21] now in your home or wherever you are why
[35:23] don't you decree why don't you declare
[35:26] there's power in the spoken word there's
[35:29] power in speaking out truth I believe
[35:33] that on a scientific level a biological
[35:36] level that every cell of your body is
[35:39] designed by God to respond to your voice
[35:43] if you don't have the boldness to speak
[35:46] it out then then let it be the most
[35:48] powerful thought that you have right now
[35:50] but if you can can squeak it out or
[35:53] shout it out
[35:54] you should declare right now my season
[35:57] of unbelief is over lord I believe help
[36:02] thou my unbelief and listen at what
[36:06] happened when straightway the father of
[36:09] the child cried out and said with tears
[36:12] lord I believe help thou my unbelief
[36:15] when Jesus saw that the people came
[36:17] running together he rebuked the foul
[36:19] spirit saying unto Him thou dumb and
[36:22] deaf spirit I charge thee come out of
[36:25] him and enter into him no more
[36:28] enter no more into him and the spirit
[36:31] cried and rent him sore and came out of
[36:34] him and he was he was as one dead in so
[36:37] much that many said he is dead but Jesus
[36:40] took him by the hand and lifted him up
[36:42] and he arose and when he was come into
[36:44] the house his disciples asked him why
[36:46] can't why couldn't we do anything about
[36:48] this why couldn't we cast him out and he
[36:51] saith unto them this kind can come forth
[36:53] by nothing but by prayer and by fasting
[36:55] that means there's a process involved
[36:59] there is a timeframe involved there is
[37:03] the question of faithfulness and
[37:05] obedience and sacrifice involved I'm
[37:10] learning that in order for some of the
[37:12] promises that God has made in our life
[37:14] to come to full fruition
[37:16] there's a process involved of proving
[37:19] again and again Lord I'm going to
[37:21] believe Lord I'm going to be faithful
[37:23] Lord I'm going to obey you
[37:25] when I don't
[37:26] know what else to do I'm going to do
[37:28] what I've always done in faith believing
[37:31] that when I need to do something
[37:33] different you'll give me those
[37:34] instructions and by grace I'll be able
[37:37] to recognize that it's your voice and
[37:40] step up and do whatever it is that
[37:43] you're calling me to do faith is a
[37:45] powerful force what is faith faith is
[37:50] the substance of things hoped for and
[37:52] it's the evidence of things not seen
[37:55] in order to operate in faith we have to
[37:59] operate from the unseen realm because
[38:03] sometimes what we speak is not what we
[38:05] see in fact I'm finding out that in this
[38:10] process of believing God and watching
[38:13] God perform his word my feelings often
[38:17] have nothing to do with my faith and
[38:20] I've got to keep them separated in other
[38:23] words you know sometimes we receive
[38:26] prayer or sometimes we pray and we get
[38:29] up from our prayer or we move on in life
[38:32] from our prayer and we don't feel any
[38:34] better we still feel the symptoms of our
[38:36] sickness or we don't see any major
[38:39] breakthroughs with our lost loved ones
[38:41] or we don't feel like we're moving any
[38:43] closer to God's ordained plan for our
[38:46] life and so everything about us feels
[38:49] the same
[38:50] so feelings are legitimate I'm not in
[38:53] any way diminishing the importance of
[38:56] our feelings because we're emotional
[38:58] beings with with lots of feelings but
[39:01] what I am saying is if God's Word said
[39:05] so and you're willing to be honest about
[39:08] your faith lord I believe help thou my
[39:12] unbelief any measure of unbelief that's
[39:16] in me I submit it to you I'm not hiding
[39:19] it under a rock I'm not pretending to be
[39:21] super Christian I'm just being real I
[39:24] want you to see it I want you to help me
[39:27] with it I don't want to hold on to my
[39:28] unbelief if you will learn if I will
[39:32] learn if New Hope revival ministry folk
[39:34] will learn to approach God in that way
[39:37] just honest and open
[39:40] hiding behind anything I truly believe
[39:43] that God will give us grace to separate
[39:46] our feelings from our faith I remember
[39:50] one time a great man of God brother
[39:52] William Branham was ministering in a
[39:54] prayer line and there were unbelievable
[39:56] incredible miracles taking place and
[39:59] night after night and in one of those
[40:02] meetings he he exhorted the people he
[40:06] said when you come through the prayer
[40:07] line and you believe God for your
[40:09] healing and the word of the Lord is to
[40:12] you that you're healed you're going and
[40:13] you don't feel any better you don't feel
[40:16] healed he made this statement
[40:19] what does feelings have to do with it
[40:22] that's a bold statement to make do you
[40:25] agree but it's an accurate statement
[40:27] there must be a separation between our
[40:31] feelings and our faith our feelings are
[40:33] based on what we think we know our faith
[40:37] is based on what we know our feelings
[40:40] are based on what our senses our five
[40:42] senses are telling us or our memories
[40:46] those thought patterns of past
[40:49] disappointment that continue to dictate
[40:52] our daily life but our faith can tell us
[40:55] something entirely different do you
[40:57] believe that you believe that your
[40:59] feelings can tell you it's never going
[41:01] to be any better and then all of a
[41:02] sudden faith rise up in your heart
[41:05] seemingly from out of nowhere and say oh
[41:07] yes it is lord I believe help thou my
[41:12] unbelief
[41:12] I'm encouraging you right now to put
[41:16] your feelings aside and I wouldn't ask
[41:18] you to do something so difficult if I
[41:21] didn't have to do the very same thing
[41:23] mmm more than once every day here are my
[41:27] feelings they're legitimate I have them
[41:29] I might not like them but I have them
[41:32] but I'm sitting them aside here's the
[41:35] measure of unbelief that exists because
[41:37] of disappointment sometimes sometimes
[41:41] your disappointment in people your
[41:43] disappointment in others can actually
[41:46] affect your ability to have faith to
[41:49] believe God what's God got to do with
[41:52] what other people
[41:53] have done to disappoint you so I've had
[41:56] to set them aside I'll have to set them
[41:59] aside before I go to bed tonight
[42:00] probably I will again tomorrow you will
[42:03] too why don't we get started right now
[42:05] why don't we just say my feelings
[42:09] they're legitimate but they're not
[42:11] according to faith there's something on
[42:14] the inside you say well brother Shelly I
[42:16] don't I don't have that kind of faith
[42:18] the Bible says you do the Word of God
[42:22] says to every man is given a measure the
[42:26] measure of faith so it's there it may be
[42:30] under used it may be under developed but
[42:32] it's there you've been given a seed of
[42:34] faith I'll tell you this the more we
[42:37] lean on our feelings the more we lean on
[42:39] our five senses the more we lean on our
[42:41] own human understanding and reasoning
[42:44] faith has a tendency to shrink but the
[42:48] more we use it the more we apply it the
[42:51] more often we set our feelings aside and
[42:53] we say it's not by sight faith is not by
[42:58] sight it's not even by hearing we can
[43:01] just say Lord I'm going to believe
[43:02] because your word said that I can and
[43:05] your track record with me says I can
[43:08] believe you I can trust you
[43:10] I just want to lead you in a prayer
[43:12] because I truly believe that what God is
[43:15] doing in our local community of faith
[43:17] it's it's a bigger thing I believe it's
[43:20] bigger than my life I believe it's
[43:22] bigger than the Saints who worship with
[43:24] us in this tiny little place I believe
[43:28] that God's people in general are dealing
[43:31] with these same kinds of issues and I
[43:33] believe there are many of you watching
[43:35] this program right now that can totally
[43:37] relate to this and I want you to know
[43:39] that without faith it's impossible to
[43:41] please God but I know that there's faith
[43:44] in you this very moment one of the ways
[43:48] that I encourage my faith from time to
[43:50] time and try to build myself up praying
[43:53] in the spirit praying in the Holy Ghost
[43:54] is to remember the faithfulness of God
[43:57] when I look back over what God has
[44:00] accomplished in my life and for my
[44:01] family my two sons had a pretty serious
[44:04] wreck a few months ago the
[44:06] truck was totaled the phone call came
[44:09] it's a phone call that nobody wants to
[44:12] receive no parent especially I went
[44:15] friend a brother in the Lord with me we
[44:19] didn't exactly know what we were gonna
[44:20] meet when we got there I can't tell you
[44:23] that I was just cool as a cucumber
[44:26] you know what that expression means I
[44:28] can't tell you that I was just you know
[44:30] whistling but I can tell you this I was
[44:34] confessing from the innermost part of my
[44:37] being Lord you are faithful you are
[44:39] righteous you are good I don't know how
[44:42] this is gonna turn out but I know that
[44:45] you are not going to verse 8 me or my
[44:47] sons I know you're not going to forget
[44:50] my family and I know that whatever
[44:52] happens it may not be good but it's
[44:55] going to be for my good when I start
[44:58] looking back over that or all the times
[45:00] that God has healed me and brought me
[45:02] through a few years ago I was hobbling
[45:04] around like an old man long before my
[45:07] time my feet were not only hurting but
[45:10] they were deformed and and I was
[45:12] fighting really to stay alive the
[45:17] discouragement and of not being able to
[45:19] walk comfortably many times seemingly
[45:22] was almost to take me out I even told my
[45:26] wife I'm ready to have my feet cut off
[45:29] I'm tired of suffering and God moved for
[45:32] me
[45:33] he brought healing to my body and he
[45:36] gave me strength so all I have to do is
[45:38] think about those things his goodness
[45:40] his past track record in my life and I
[45:45] start feeling again wow I can believe
[45:48] you Lord if you did that for me you're
[45:51] the same yesterday and today and forever
[45:53] and so that's a key I'm giving you a key
[45:56] if you're willing to take it and put it
[45:57] in the lock praise worship Thanksgiving
[46:01] reflecting remembering what the Lord has
[46:04] done for you in the past will help you
[46:07] dare to believe for what God wants to do
[46:09] in your life today and tomorrow and for
[46:12] the rest of your journey here on the
[46:14] earth would you just be real with me
[46:16] right now would you just be honest with
[46:18] me right now
[46:19] if you've got a particular prayer
[46:20] request I would be more than happy and
[46:23] the prayer warriors the intercessors and
[46:26] our ministry would be so glad to pray
[46:29] with you to take your needs before the
[46:31] Lord and I would love for you to take
[46:33] the chance to share them with us the
[46:35] gospel channel there's a phone number
[46:38] also that you can call and there will be
[46:40] prayer warriors there I know that well
[46:43] that will take the message and they will
[46:45] pray and they will seek the Lord on your
[46:47] behalf but I want to pray with you right
[46:49] now I want to take the few minutes that
[46:51] we have left to just say I feel like
[46:56] somebody is going to be honest with your
[47:00] measure of unbelief that's been creeping
[47:03] up you've got faith you do believe but
[47:05] things have been getting a little bit
[47:07] discouraging for you lately and I've got
[47:10] a feeling that somebody right now
[47:12] somebody's you're gonna be real you're
[47:15] gonna lay that before the Lord you're
[47:16] gonna confess it to him the Bible tells
[47:19] us that's what we do we don't have to
[47:21] approach God like we're gonna
[47:23] accidentally telling something he
[47:25] doesn't already know he already knows
[47:27] the deepest part of who we are so I
[47:29] think he delights when we're willing to
[47:31] just confess our weakness before him I
[47:33] know the Bible did say let the weak say
[47:35] I am strong so you can come to the Lord
[47:38] and say father I'm weak that's what
[47:40] that's what Jesus prayed my spirits
[47:43] willing but my flesh is weak you can
[47:46] confess your weakness to the Lord and
[47:48] then when you're done praying that's
[47:49] when you get up and say I'm strong
[47:52] because it's not about feeling you may
[47:55] still feel weak but it's not about that
[47:57] is it it's about faith it's about
[47:59] believing God let's pray together right
[48:01] now father I am so thankful that you've
[48:05] given us this opportunity you've given
[48:07] us this amazing studio and you've given
[48:09] us this amazing opportunity to speak to
[48:12] people and I do believe there may be
[48:15] someone watching who doesn't know you
[48:16] and I would ask Lord that your grace
[48:19] would cover them right now and that they
[48:22] would repent that they would confess
[48:24] their sin that they would invite you to
[48:26] come in with your blood and wash away
[48:28] every
[48:29] sinn deliver them from the spirit of
[48:31] iniquity and set them free to serve you
[48:34] but right now my heart is going out to
[48:37] believers to those who love youth to
[48:39] those who know your word enough to have
[48:42] invited you into their life there may be
[48:45] some who have only trusted you in in in
[48:48] the form of joining a church or having
[48:51] some identity by birth maybe feeling
[48:54] like I was born into a Christian family
[48:56] and that is not enough and so Lord I'm
[49:00] asking you to draw them maybe you're
[49:02] drawing them right now they're thinking
[49:04] there's more to this born-again life
[49:06] this Christian life and and if so I'm
[49:09] asking you to manifest yourself I'm
[49:11] asking you Lord to make yourself known
[49:13] and real to them right now
[49:16] let them know that this is a daily
[49:18] relationship one day at a time I pray
[49:23] that you would make that real and I also
[49:25] pray for the believer who has prayed and
[49:29] prayed and prayed about particular
[49:31] things and not seen the results or
[49:35] someone who has had precious promises
[49:38] given to them from your word or from the
[49:40] prophetic gifts and they've not yet seen
[49:42] the reality or the fruition fulfillment
[49:45] of those things and they've gotten weary
[49:47] I'm praying for them also right now that
[49:49] they would lay all unbelief before you
[49:52] that they would come Lord even as this
[49:55] precious father in the Gospels came and
[49:57] said if you can do anything Lord I'm
[50:00] asking you to do it and and you spoke to
[50:03] him and said all things are possible to
[50:04] him that believeth in the man so
[50:07] honestly lord I believe help out my
[50:09] unbelief we're praying that right now
[50:11] across the world we're praying that to
[50:13] you right now Lord Lord we believe
[50:16] helped our unbelief help our unbelief to
[50:21] shrink help our unbelief to be bathed by
[50:23] the blood of Jesus Christ
[50:25] may we be set free from it may we be
[50:28] delivered from it may we have the Grace
[50:30] and the wisdom of God to set our
[50:33] feelings aside and let faith arise may
[50:36] we just take this moment Lord to thank
[50:39] you for your track record with
[50:41] the one you give us in the word the one
[50:44] we read about in church history but the
[50:47] one we know about our personal
[50:50] individual experience with you you've
[50:53] never failed us Lord
[50:55] you've always been faithful and true you
[50:58] may not have come the moment we wanted
[51:00] you to come and yet you've never been
[51:01] late you're always right on time
[51:04] it may not have happened exactly the way
[51:06] we wanted it or expected it but you have
[51:10] such a way of bringing your will to pass
[51:13] and then comforting our hearts and
[51:14] letting us know this is me this is me
[51:18] lord help each one right now to
[51:20] recognize that this is a journey it is a
[51:23] process we don't get it all right at one
[51:26] time we don't get it all right today and
[51:29] not have to work a little at it tomorrow
[51:31] it's not that we're saved by works
[51:33] that's not at all what I what I'm saying
[51:35] but Lord we have some ups and downs we
[51:39] have some herbs and flows we get knocked
[51:41] down but thanks be to God your people
[51:44] get up again by your grace by your
[51:47] strength so I'm asking you to raise up
[51:50] right now encouragement on your people
[51:53] whoever would watch this broadcast
[51:55] whoever would hear these words Lord let
[51:58] them make contact with you it can't be
[52:00] my prayer only let their prayer let it
[52:04] arise let their faith arise right now
[52:07] and let us all confess lord I believe
[52:10] help out my unbelief I'm asking you Lord
[52:13] for the strengthening of faith and I'm
[52:16] asking you for the acceleration of your
[52:19] promises in every life that's watching
[52:22] this program right now in the lovely
[52:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for
[52:29] his glory I felt that I could feel his
[52:32] presence getting nearer and nearer and
[52:35] nearer and I'm asking him to let you
[52:38] feel that right now to let you feel the
[52:41] gentleness of his presence and yet the
[52:43] realness of who he is
[52:45] when he comes can I tell you it's going
[52:48] to be all right because God is good and
[52:52] as I said a moment ago everything that
[52:54] happens in your life is not good but
[52:57] it's for your good it's for my good and
[53:00] in the good times we have to bless his
[53:03] name in the bad times we bless his name
[53:05] like David prayed after the great loss
[53:08] of his son the Lord gives and the Lord
[53:11] takes away blessed be the name of the
[53:15] Lord
[53:15] this posture posturing ourselves to give
[53:19] Thanksgiving to God in all situations
