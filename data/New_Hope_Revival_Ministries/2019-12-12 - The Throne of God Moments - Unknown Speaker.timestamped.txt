[0:00] the reality of the throne of God is
[0:02] right here in the believer in the last
[0:06] stage because we understand by the
[0:15] revelation of the New Testament that the
[0:17] Ark of the Covenant is no longer a box
[0:20] hidden somewhere in a cave in Jerusalem
[0:24] but the Ark of the Covenant is once
[0:26] again the throne of God and the throne
[0:29] of God is only in simple form in another
[0:34] dimension the reality of the throne of
[0:37] God is not somewhere else the reality of
[0:41] the throne of God is right here in the
[0:44] believer in the last day
[0:47] this is his throne in this hour one day
[0:50] he will gather us all back into his
[0:53] throne in another dimension but in this
[0:56] hour his throne is the Ark of the
[0:59] Covenant and the Ark of the Covenant is
[1:01] the as the inside of the inside of the
[1:04] believer so here he is and so if he is
[1:10] there then our shoud should not appraise
[1:14] our response should not be based on
[1:18] feeling at all it should be based on
[1:21] reality and he's on through
[1:24] it's not based on on what we see God
[1:27] doing because the bride is not seeking
[1:31] his hand she has his hand he gave us his
[1:37] hand it's part of the mat rollin he gave
[1:42] us his hand we're not seeking his hand
[1:45] we're seeking him we're seeking the
[1:49] reality of who he is and that he would
[1:52] come in such power and in such fullness
[1:56] that he reigns completely totally reigns
[2:01] over every aspect of our lives including
[2:05] our time everything is mirrored
[2:09] he's lord over every part of who we are
[2:12] does anybody believe that's the reality
[2:15] of the word
