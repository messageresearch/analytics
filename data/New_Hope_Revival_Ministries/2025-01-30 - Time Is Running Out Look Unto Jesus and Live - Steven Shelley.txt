Description:
Time is running out, and the sand in the hourglass is almost gone. As we stand on the brink of eternity, one question truly matters: Do we have Christ formed in us? Instead of fixating on our flaws and failures, let’s look away from ourselves and fix our eyes on Jesus. It’s by beholding Him that we are changed from glory to glory. Don’t let doubt hold you back—embrace His grace and be transformed today!
