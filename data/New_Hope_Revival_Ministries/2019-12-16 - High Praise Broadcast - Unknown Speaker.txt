Description:
High praise is praise given no matter the circumstances. It isn't everyday praise, but praise given with a little more abandonment. That kind of praise is a weapon in our spiritual arsenal, a praise that will change our situation. When we are living in hope deferred, praise is our solution.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of New Hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama I want to share with you today some of the things that the Lord has been dealing with me about in my own personal walk with him I want to start off by reading a portion of Scripture found in the Book of Psalms in fact it's Psalm 149 beginning in verse 1 praise ye the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of saints let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their king let them praise His name in the dance let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp for the Lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation let the Saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon their beds and I want you to pay close attention to verse 6 let the high praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand let the high praises of God be in their mouths and a two-edged sword in their hand you know I recently spoke to you about giving thanks about Thanksgiving because we here in the States were celebrating a time with our family set aside to give thanks to God but you know the Bible tells us that we should constantly and continually be giving God praise Psalm 34 verse 1 said I will bless the Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth and you know I understand that we have jobs to do and lives to live and duties and responsibilities I understand that we might not always be able to lift our hands and go about speaking praises to God but I believe that there is an attitude that we can set in our heart one of gratitude one of praise you know when I read this portion of scripture in Psalm 149 I'm not really getting that this is only an inner response to the goodness of God but I'm getting the idea that the psalmist believed that his God was so good and so faithful and so powerful that he deserved a high praise a special praise one that is set apart one that is full and complete and sincere I grew up in the Pentecostal church and well some of the Saints would have little sayings that they would say over and over again and they have stuck with me through my life I would sometimes maybe be working with some of the brothers maybe we would be having a work day at the church and something would go wrong and somebody would say ho praise the Lord anyhow I understood that that was a man who wanted to say in the good times and in the bad times when things are going good praise him and when things are going bad praise him I understand that but the psalmist here is not speaking about that kind of praise he's talking about a particular praise let the high praises of God be in their mouth I looked at that word in the Hebrew and it's a feminine word a feminine noun it's used to indicate praise throughout the Old Testament it's used in the sense of lifting up raising up or rising up one word that we could use that would be very similar to this word is exaltation and then I woke up a Sunday morning the two ago and it was in my mind to try to figure out higher praise Lord how could I give you a higher praise than what I've been offering you I just went over to the computer and I looked up synonyms for the word higher and it gave me some help in definition first and then in synonyms in definition it said advanced higher praise advanced in complexity or elaboration I think that we could use that word in fact it was suggested that sometimes you might hear the word used like higher education or higher mathematics and what that means is not base level but advanced studies if the psalmist said that we as believers should go about with the high praise or the higher praises of God in our mouths he means not just an ordinary praise the Lord thank you Jesus Oh hallelujah I think he means we ought to get involved in our praise the Bible talks about in the Book of Psalms those nine different forms of Davidic praise where the posture of the body is used we the hands are used for clapping or for lifting up or for playing instruments the postures of the body would be laying prostrate before the Lord or kneeling before him and in some Psalms it talks about standing in the congregation of the saints and then there were those three vocal expressions of Davidic praise where we would sing to the Lord and where we would shout to the Lord and where we would speak of the goodness of the Lord these are the biblical expressions of praise I know that sometimes people say well I wasn't made up to to be demonstrative or to be excitable well I want you to know if you should take a good look at the goodness of God in your life you would have a hard time just settling for praise the Lord I think you would want to lift up his name with everything that's within you and what I found out is when things are tough when things are less than lovely that's the best time to lift up a high praise anyway back to the word higher those synonyms that I found were tall acute even thrill or piercing lofty grand high flown like a flag that's been raised all the way up to the top of the flagpole not down here at the bottom of the flagpole or half mass they call it but a high praise one that just lifts the Lord way up in exaltation in rising up and in praising him elevated raised heightened high priced expensive dear costly strong fierce and then we know that in the natural that word high or higher is sometimes used for those who are inebriated or tipsy are loaded or drunken well I want you to know that there are examples in the Bible where men and women fell under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and they began to dance before the Lord in what those looking on would have described they were in a drunken state I know that sometimes that really flies against our dignity but I want to be like the psalmist David he was not a perfect man nor am i but he was a man after God's own heart I want to be that kind of man and I'm sure that many of you have that same desire we're going to make mistakes we're going to fail along the way but God is good he is good in all things at all times I'm finding out that if we gripe and complain we are outside of the will of God I know that your desire like mine is to be in God's will not standing on the outskirts of his will looking into what could be but right straight in the middle of his perfect will for our life and if we are in that perfect will there is no room for griping and groaning and complaining and if this is our habit I think it speaks to us that we are not finding that place with him where we can live the blessed life the favored life I tell you it doesn't mean that pains won't come sickness will come and heartaches will come but I want you to know the biblical precedent the example that has been set for us in God's Word is that our response should be praise again not ordinary praise but high praise and in this verse of scripture I feel inspiration I feel that the psalmist is saying that high praise that elevated praise becomes warfare it becomes strategy for battle just like having that two-edged sword and I want you to know that is the Word of God and if you are armed with the Word of God then you are a powerful believer if you understand that word by Holy Spirit revelation and if you are staying in that word and have planted your life firmly on the uncompromised Word of God not a watered-down modern version but a pure word like the Holy Spirit just takes that scripture and makes it alive to you I always say that when we receive a revelation like that that truth becomes a part of who we are and we become a part of that truth I was recently reading about a woman who led a prayer meeting and I didn't know if I was going to share it today or not it was in California and it was a women's prayer meeting many years ago her name was Francis Metcalf and something that she said has really stuck with me she said that the Word of God was just speaking to her in such a profound way about prays and finally she felt like the Lord said to her I want you to become praise personified I don't know if that means anything to you or not but that really gets ahold of me become an embodiment of praise now that is one way that we can praise the Lord continually because our life becomes a praise it means that we are making choices that honor God and honor God's Word and that even our obedience becomes praised to him wouldn't you like for your very life to be a praise unto the Lord so that when you are say involved in other activities not Church related not particularly spiritual but yet your life has been transformed by the Word of God and so your language is different your response and reaction to the things that happen to you are different and the world watches and they see and they know there's something different in your life perhaps they even ask you how is it that you can be so calm in the midst of such chaos I have to confess to you I've not always handled chaos that well sometimes we get in a tither when things start falling apart all at one time or we have a time deadline but I want to work on that in my life I want to know and trust because that's what this lifestyle of praise really is it is a life of trust it's saying to God no matter what happens to me I know it's going to be alright because you are sovereign God and you love me I want you to know child of God he loves you and he desires your praise in fact the scripture said he inhabits he lives in the praises of his people I truly believe that there is power when we enter into a place of higher praise maybe you get in this in the atmosphere of your church service you begin to worship the Lord you begin to move a little bit beyond your comfort zone you give God a little more respect and honor and praise than you normally do I believe if you're willing to make even that sacrifice of praise there's power the power of God comes in when the children of God enter into praise sincere praise it draws the anointing it draws the presence of God into the room now I mentioned in your in the sanctuary of your church but it doesn't have to be there but I'm not going to praise God like a wild man in my home and then go to church and act like a little church mouse now I want to have an an even lifestyle of praise now I tell you sometimes I get pretty rowdy in my home even in my office just over and over again when you when you just take a moment to meditate and reflect on what could have been but God had it not been for God and how he moved in a particular situation you could be facing something so different than what you're facing right now and your heart just swells up with Thanksgiving and you've got to let it out and somehow oh maybe I'm just an emotional sort of person but somehow just a little quiet hallelujah it doesn't seem to be enough the psalmist seems to be indicating that if we go forth with the high praises of God in our mouth and a two-edged sword in our hand we will be a people with the victory I want you to know God wants you and I to have the victory he is Victor and he wants you and I to fellowship with him in that victory he wants us to be overcomers not just survivors not just those who barely get through life I don't know what your circumstances are but I'm not talking about a praise I'm not talking about a Thanksgiving that's based on your circumstances remember when we were together before we talked about Habakkuk and the praise that he was offering to the Lord and he said even though the vines are bare and the trees are not bringing forth and the fields are barren yet I will praise the Lord I've got a feeling that his praise was not an everyday ordinary praise I have a feeling it was a high praise that kind of praise pushes back the enemy it pushes back the darkness when Pentecost when that movement of the Spirit of God was breaking out in America the west coast of the United States in Los Angeles California there was an utterance of the spirit that went forth in some of those services and a lot of it was recorded by different individuals and it is reported that in one of those glory meetings a word came forth and said praising the Lord puts the devil to flight it appears that the Spirit of God wanted to make it real to those new believers they were new spirit filled believers they were experiencing God in a way they had never experienced him before and the Spirit of God evidently wanted to instruct them is part of your spiritual arsenal it's one of the weapons in your armory it puts the devil to flight I'm convinced that Satan doesn't know what to do with us when our response is high praise especially when tragedy grief loss the death of a loved one some turn of events in family relationships that could easily throw us into despair or at the least depression and yet we choose like Paul and Silas to come in the midnight hour and offer God a high praise not some moan full praise nobody knows the troubles I've seen but one that says I will praise the Lord at all times I believe praise is a language of victory in Exodus chapter 15 we read about God's victory by bringing the children of Israel through the Red Sea the Jewish people will sometimes say that it was the greatest demonstration of the supernatural power of God and we would say in the Old Testament he really saved his people that day and the Bible tells us that Moses led a song in verse 1 it says then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song under the Lord and that's X Exodus 15 in 1 I will sing unto the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider happy thrown into the sea the Lord is my strength and song and he has become my salvation he is my god and listen and I will prepare him and habitation my father's God and I will exalt him the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name and it goes on and it's beautiful in verse 11 it says who is like unto thee O Lord among the gods who is like the glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders thou stretches out by right hand the earth swallowed them thou in thy mercy has led forth the people which thou hast redeemed thou has guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation I like that phrase fearful in praises there is an awe there is a reverential fear that we can sometimes feel experienced when we look at the might and the power and even the mercy of our God our Father God and it it strikes a chord in us in fact sometimes it makes us say how could a God like that care about just one little individual like me I tell you he does and it's an awesome reality when that becomes real in your spirit man he's fearful and praises in fact what we praise him for sometimes and glorify God he and it actually becomes the terror of our enemies it was a serious event that took place that day God was giving the children of Israel passage toward the promised land and their response was songs of victory we sing an old hymn sometime all victory in Jesus my Savior forever and I want you to know that God wants to give you his victory if there's any part of your life that you have not surrendered to him fully completely there's no better time than the present to say Lord I surrender all Here I am take my life and if you can use me and I guarantee you he can no matter how broken you are if you can use me Lord then I would certainly want that that would be my desire let's be the victorious people of God in our praise let's use our praise to push back the darkness to create in us a new hope to restore some some real hope that the enemy has tried to steal from us what I find out is when you are weighted down by Hope deferred promises that you're weary and tired of waiting on your best response is to give God praise to let him know ok I'm not so happy about the timing but Lord I accept that as part of your plan for me because you are leading me into a response of praise when we praise the Lord in this manner it sends a message out there it sends a message to our Creator that we are grateful and thankful for his wonderful work in our life but it also sends a message to the enemy you know I'm convinced that that that Satan believed that he was going to take job off of the path of righteousness and that job would indeed curse God and die as his wife suggested in her pain but I want you to know there was no way in the world that a loving God would have allowed that kind of tragedy upon job had he not already known what job's response was going to be and though he had some low moments his testimony was oh how I would like to have a pen of iron that I could write these words I know that my Redeemer liveth hallelujah and this is our response in the good time and in the bad time I know that my redeemer lives and I know that he has a plan for my life I hope that you are encouraged in this moment I hope something has been said that will lift you and I hope that you will take this as your new strategy and if you have used this strategy of high praise before but have perhaps grown a little cold in it I pray that you will be renewed and as you are reminded today I pray that you will offer God a praise higher than what you've been offering him taller raise the flag all the way up to the top and give God a high praise today Lord bless you thank you for being with us bye-bye you
