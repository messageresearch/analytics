[0:00] hello I'm brother Shelly from the new
[0:03] hope revival ministries and we are so
[0:06] thankful to have you watching today we
[0:09] are incredibly blessed this week this
[0:12] has been our camp-meeting week and we
[0:15] are off to a good start where we're not
[0:17] even quite to the middle yet but we are
[0:19] off to a really good start the Lord has
[0:22] been moving by his spirit and he has
[0:25] been speaking to us from his word I
[0:28] don't know about you but I find in this
[0:31] last season of my life that scriptures
[0:33] that I have read all my life heard all
[0:36] my life and even preached all my life
[0:38] are taking on seemingly a new and fresh
[0:43] anointing and God it seems as making
[0:46] them so personal and so real to the
[0:49] deepest part of who I am and I'm
[0:51] testifying of that not because I want to
[0:54] brag but because I sense and believe
[0:57] that God is perhaps doing the very same
[1:00] thing for many sincere hearted people
[1:03] across the world perhaps you're one of
[1:06] those the scripture is becoming real to
[1:09] you and richer to you as the Holy Spirit
[1:12] unpacks it and reveals it and we can
[1:15] truly say that these are exciting times
[1:17] trouble sometimes but very exciting
[1:20] times because in the midst of all the
[1:23] turmoil and all the darkness and all the
[1:26] ugly God is raising up a bride to
[1:29] overcome in what we would call Satan's
[1:33] Eden the god of this evil age who has
[1:36] certainly blinded the minds of so many
[1:38] people even as as my mind as perhaps
[1:41] your mind was blinded at one time until
[1:44] the glorious light of the gospel of
[1:46] Jesus Christ penetrated the darkness and
[1:49] took us into a new world who we used to
[1:52] sing a hymn when I was a boy I'm in a
[1:55] new world and really we are when we come
[1:58] to know the Lord and then when God
[2:00] begins to reveal his word to us it's a
[2:02] new world all over again I'm so blessed
[2:05] today to have one of our camp speakers
[2:08] and someone who I have known
[2:12] for many years there were many years
[2:14] that I was busy in in my part of the
[2:18] world and he was busy all over the world
[2:20] but I'm so blessed to be able to say
[2:22] that I've known him for a long time and
[2:24] we have brother Ben nor rod with us
[2:26] today and we're going to get him to
[2:29] introduce himself in a moment tell you a
[2:31] little bit about his ministry and how he
[2:33] was called the ministry it seems like
[2:35] people are always interested to know you
[2:38] know how do you know you're called and
[2:39] and what do you do to step into that
[2:41] call and so he's going to share some of
[2:43] that with us and before we leave you
[2:45] today we're gonna let him go to the word
[2:48] and share some things with you perhaps
[2:51] that he's been sharing with us here that
[2:54] that are are themes that really speak to
[2:57] me in this our God is certainly giving
[3:00] us victory over our thought life and I
[3:03] find that when we can change our
[3:06] thoughts our life is changed there's no
[3:08] doubt about that so brother Ben again
[3:10] thank you so much for being here today
[3:12] brother Ben or rod and where is your
[3:15] home where do you live I live in
[3:17] Manchester Tennessee Manchester
[3:19] Tennessee now I know where Manchester is
[3:21] but I don't know if everybody will know
[3:23] so - what is that close to Manchester is
[3:25] exactly in the middle between
[3:27] Chattanooga and Nashville
[3:29] if you fall to interstate 24 or put your
[3:31] finger right in the center of Tennessee
[3:33] you'll see Manchester low-crawl dead
[3:35] patch out there all right all right
[3:37] I didn't know they were crawdads in
[3:39] Tennessee there are we are incredibly
[3:43] blessed our church I just want to tell
[3:44] you how blessed we are to have your
[3:46] ministry and it's it's I think
[3:50] old-fashioned is a compliment I hope you
[3:52] do I do I feel that way yes thank I know
[3:55] some people use that as an insult sure
[3:57] but for me it's always been a compliment
[3:59] if someone said old fashioned I grew up
[4:03] like you did singing give me that
[4:04] old-time religion yes but you definitely
[4:07] have a ministry that reminds me of my
[4:09] childhood
[4:10] reminds me of the of the fiery
[4:12] evangelists that God would bring to us
[4:14] and the atmosphere I'll never forget the
[4:18] atmosphere and so it's wonderful to be
[4:20] reminded of that and every time you've
[4:22] ministered for us we have felt that
[4:25] would you just share a little bit about
[4:26] your life you may not want to tell your
[4:28] age although you're young enough now not
[4:30] to be ashamed of it but tell people how
[4:34] long you've been ministering and just a
[4:35] little bit about a cerrar I'd be happy
[4:37] to first I want to say thank you to to
[4:39] you and all the saints here in Alabama
[4:41] we've had a tremendous time at this camp
[4:44] meeting this far it's just been
[4:45] extraordinary we're glad to hear that
[4:47] you're a tremendous host tremendous
[4:49] friend and we just appreciate the Lord
[4:51] and your life and the opportunity to
[4:54] come and speak today and to be able to
[4:56] share our life and what we've been
[4:58] through and where we've come from and
[5:00] hopefully a little bit where we're going
[5:02] yeah yeah that's right I certainly
[5:04] appreciate the Lord for what he's done
[5:05] for me I'm 40 years old and if I don't
[5:09] tell you that my bald spot will
[5:10] eventually but I I was I was raised in a
[5:14] Christian home my mother and father was
[5:16] apostolic originally and when they first
[5:19] come to the Lord my mother and father
[5:21] both raised in Tennessee on either side
[5:24] of where they called Monterey Mountain
[5:25] which is just a little old littled
[5:27] hollers out in the middle of nowhere and
[5:29] my my great-grandmother was full Lakota
[5:33] Sioux Indian oh really and so my
[5:36] grandmother being kind of kind of a
[5:39] tough tough woman she was a little short
[5:42] gal about five foot she worked on the
[5:44] railroad and chewed tobacco they drank
[5:46] they didn't think nothing about the Lord
[5:48] in any way Wow
[5:49] and on the other side my mother's people
[5:51] were all free will Baptists originally
[5:53] they'll you know foot wash and shouting
[5:55] madness they used to call it so my dad's
[5:57] people wasn't religious in any way my
[5:59] mom's people were and just by my divine
[6:03] appointment of the way the Lord arranged
[6:05] it my mother and father met together he
[6:08] was he was a center for a number of
[6:10] years when they were first married and
[6:12] mom of course went to church and dad in
[6:15] 1956 he went to a little Apostolic
[6:18] meeting received the Holy Ghost and
[6:20] became a became a Bible believing
[6:21] Christian at that point and then they
[6:24] they really begin to launch out into the
[6:26] deeper things of God right and my
[6:29] brother and my sister my brothers 15
[6:32] years older than me my sister's 19 years
[6:33] old
[6:35] they they wasn't really planning on
[6:37] having any more children but my mother
[6:40] began to study the Bible about the woman
[6:44] being the betting ground of life and she
[6:46] said the spear the Lord moved on her and
[6:48] when he moved on her he spoke to her
[6:50] specifically about you need to have
[6:52] another child
[6:53] this is about 1975 dad of course he was
[6:57] a little you know if he about it cuz dad
[6:59] was 42 he and mom was my age and so she
[7:04] just began praying and the Lord finally
[7:06] dealt with Daddy and and they they
[7:08] attempted to conceive the first attempt
[7:11] brought a miscarriage which was in 1976
[7:14] for me
[7:15] when I come in 1977 March of 77 was when
[7:19] I was born my mother had one
[7:21] complication after another and actually
[7:24] the doctors tried to get her to abort me
[7:25] they said that you'd say lost cause
[7:27] he'll be Down syndrome he won't be it
[7:29] won't be right and I had a short
[7:32] umbilical cord anyways and so I wasn't
[7:35] really a healthy baby while mom was
[7:36] caring she was very sick and there was a
[7:39] minister there in Ohio that that laid
[7:42] his hands on mama to pray for one night
[7:44] when they thought they would lose me and
[7:46] he prayed this prayer over my mama and
[7:49] they didn't know whether I was a boy
[7:50] girl or anything like that and so he
[7:52] just prayed and said father this man
[7:54] this does this man child that's that's
[7:57] within our sister I want you to raise
[7:59] him up to be a minister to carry the
[8:01] gospel to the world Wow so this was the
[8:04] prayer he prayed from the beginning so
[8:05] here mom tell those stories all my life
[8:09] you know I always felt like the Lord had
[8:11] a purpose for me and I I believe my life
[8:14] was sanctified for the purpose of the
[8:16] gospel because when I was six years old
[8:19] I had my first experience with the Lord
[8:21] my mother and father they came from
[8:25] Apostolic in 1968 they heard about a man
[8:28] by the name of William Branham and they
[8:31] heard that there was a prophet in the
[8:32] land and they desired to know more about
[8:34] it and there were some friends of theirs
[8:36] that had some recordings and had some
[8:38] books of this
[8:40] Brannen and they begin listening and
[8:43] they follow what people identify is what
[8:45] they say the message of that day the
[8:47] message of this time so they begin
[8:50] following brother branham's ministry and
[8:52] it took him to another level in
[8:56] scripture all together and it just took
[8:57] him to another level of serving God all
[8:59] together and my mom began to read the
[9:02] Bible about women having children that
[9:05] were priests and things and so she began
[9:06] to tell me you know I think the Lord's
[9:09] got something for you son you know and
[9:11] when I was six
[9:13] there was a minister that laid his hands
[9:15] on me and it was the first experience
[9:17] that I ever had of a touch from the Holy
[9:20] Spirit I remember it specifically when
[9:22] the man laid his hands on me there was
[9:24] just a feeling washed over me and I
[9:27] remember this clean type feeling like
[9:29] something had moved on me I didn't know
[9:32] what it was I didn't know it was Jesus I
[9:33] was too young to even be able to really
[9:35] identify it but that was my first
[9:37] experience with the Lord when I was 12 I
[9:40] fell under great conviction and in my
[9:42] pastors church at the time I uh I was
[9:45] becoming a very mean little boy and I I
[9:50] was mistreated I guess in a lot of ways
[9:52] and I developed a real hatred in my
[9:54] heart and at 12 at 12 12 I just was
[9:58] beginning to really the the feeling
[10:01] toward people and I know a lot of it was
[10:03] just misunderstanding things not
[10:06] understanding life having older parents
[10:09] sometimes there was a disconnect in the
[10:11] generation things were happening they
[10:12] couldn't explain and there was a lot
[10:14] there and and I remember at 12 sitting
[10:17] in the pew and conviction striking my
[10:19] heart and the only thing I could think
[10:21] is I just want to be a good little boy
[10:22] hmm
[10:23] I'm a bad little boy so I just want to
[10:24] be a good little boy I went to the altar
[10:27] of course and asked my pastor to pray
[10:28] for me and the spear of the Lord just
[10:30] wonderfully and beautifully washed over
[10:32] me and cleanse me of that feeling and it
[10:36] is what I know now as being saved right
[10:38] yet as a venn I hadn't really received
[10:40] the Holy Ghost so there was little
[10:42] things still at working in my heart and
[10:44] as I grew toward 14 which is when I
[10:47] received the Holy Ghost I begin
[10:49] developing even greater hatred
[10:52] those things just got worse and
[10:53] intensified and you know the bulk of my
[10:56] testimony that I share with people
[10:58] around round the world one I'd want to
[10:59] tell them I was one of those kids that
[11:01] would sit in church with such hatred
[11:03] that if you crossed me in any way
[11:06] whatsoever I would try to figure out a
[11:08] way of my brain how was gonna kill you I
[11:10] would think of some way of mutilation or
[11:13] something that much yes sir yes sir it
[11:16] was it was such a tremendous feeling of
[11:18] hate I still remember toward toward
[11:20] anybody in a ward anybody and everybody
[11:23] didn't matter they matter if they
[11:24] crossed me or not eventually got to wear
[11:27] you know just the look of them if they
[11:28] looked a certain way at me and there was
[11:30] a feeling there such that so I was
[11:34] invited at the age of 14 to West Milton
[11:36] Ohio to the to the youth camp that
[11:40] brother was putting on there and you
[11:41] were invited to speak at this youth camp
[11:43] well I remember yes sir oh yeah you know
[11:46] it was a tremendous time because first
[11:49] and foremost I believe it was one of the
[11:51] one of the milestones for the people of
[11:56] that area because it was a tremendous
[11:57] revival in the beginning anyways from
[12:00] the first service that you preached the
[12:02] Holy Spirit was moving greatly amongst
[12:04] the people and many of my peers that
[12:06] that someone still serve the Lord to
[12:08] this day we're in those meetings got
[12:10] saved in those meetings and I I never
[12:12] will forget as you come to the close of
[12:14] the meeting you preached a message
[12:16] called a House of Hell giveaway and you
[12:20] were telling a little story that brother
[12:21] Branham had conveyed in a vision he'd
[12:23] had about people being bound in a prison
[12:26] house you read from the book there where
[12:29] he talked about the woman caught him and
[12:30] kissed him and her way is the way to the
[12:33] house of hell and so people at the end
[12:36] of the service were jumping and shouting
[12:38] and jerking and wailing and it scared me
[12:41] mmm
[12:42] because for the first time in my life I
[12:44] realized that there was something in the
[12:47] room that could overpower me and for me
[12:50] the the hatred and the things that I
[12:53] built up in my heart was an empowerment
[12:54] because really as a young man
[12:57] I was developing a terrible inferiority
[12:59] complex and I I just I just felt
[13:03] empowered when I could hate but for the
[13:06] first time in my life I felt overpowered
[13:08] and I felt weak and it just really
[13:10] brought me down to a place where I
[13:12] realize III better get right or I'm on
[13:15] my way to hell
[13:16] Wow and it scared me so badly that I
[13:18] stood up and actually started to walk
[13:20] out of the sanctuary and my father who
[13:22] had been watching me
[13:23] he was standing off to the side he'd
[13:26] come around just shortly and and my
[13:28] grandpa was Benny Albert so he calls me
[13:29] Benny he said where you going Benny I
[13:32] said dad that scares me to death III I
[13:35] don't I don't I don't why he said don't
[13:37] run from it run - oh wow the next
[13:41] morning
[13:41] what good advice all such a beautiful
[13:43] thing the next morning we we had service
[13:46] and what they call the little Tabernacle
[13:48] about maybe 50 kids in there and it was
[13:51] actually the last year that my age group
[13:53] was permitted to be in the tabernacle
[13:55] that morning and I was blessed to know
[13:57] that later because I know God
[13:58] orchestrated that just so I could be in
[14:00] that meeting you were preaching Satan
[14:03] you can have my coat but she can't have
[14:05] me you remember the title I remember yes
[14:07] sir yes sir absolutely and I've remember
[14:11] you describing about Joseph you told a
[14:13] story about a young man who had got into
[14:16] a car wreck and in your story you told
[14:19] about this young man having hate in his
[14:21] heart and you didn't realize it but you
[14:23] were describing me to a tee and how this
[14:26] young man needed to get saved needed to
[14:27] get right well as they say that was
[14:30] where the nail was clinched and I walked
[14:32] to the front I still remember standing
[14:34] to my feet and walking to the front and
[14:37] my hands immediately flew into the air I
[14:39] began crying and weeping and the words
[14:41] was I love you Jesus I love you Jesus I
[14:44] love you Jesus huh
[14:45] you have to understand but Steve there
[14:47] wasn't anything I loved mmm I had such
[14:49] hate in my heart there was no love in my
[14:51] heart was so am i but the sphere of the
[14:53] Lord got ahold of me and that's all I
[14:55] knew I tell you this quickly because
[14:57] this this is a little side note but it's
[14:59] always been so precious to me there was
[15:01] a younger boy
[15:02] there who who I'd been terribly mean to
[15:05] that week I'd step on his foot and push
[15:07] it around and calling names and all
[15:09] kinds of things I was just a rascal to
[15:12] this kid and if he if he hears this I
[15:14] hope he still forgives me but I am I
[15:18] never will forget when I was standing in
[15:20] the altar and the Holy Spirit was
[15:22] filling me with the with the blessed
[15:24] presence of Almighty God oh it's an
[15:26] experience I want to relive it every day
[15:28] of my life if I can everybody needs it
[15:30] yes sir absolutely absolutely and I felt
[15:34] two little hands wrap around my waist
[15:36] and I looked down and there was that
[15:38] little boy oh my Stanny with tears in
[15:41] his eyes he had been praying for me that
[15:43] God would save me Wow
[15:44] so that that's that's my beginning
[15:46] that's how I got started
[15:47] oh the theme that year was going into
[15:50] the world preach the gospel and shortly
[15:53] after that and I do mean shortly just a
[15:55] few weeks afterwards I was sitting in
[15:56] the church and listened to the sermon
[15:58] and the Holy Ghost moved to me and spoke
[16:01] to me and told me I want you to preach
[16:03] and I thought well that's just me
[16:06] thinking that Joshua desires do
[16:08] something for the Lord so that's just me
[16:10] probably thinking that well I always
[16:12] tell young men and men of any age really
[16:15] that asked me about preaching and it's
[16:17] all about a call yeah I said well I
[16:20] didn't have an angel show up and I
[16:21] didn't have you know a lightning bolt
[16:23] hit me on top of the head but there's
[16:24] one thing I know once he spoke to me it
[16:27] increased and increased and increased in
[16:30] never let up Wow
[16:31] and it moves so strongly on me that I
[16:33] couldn't sleep I couldn't eat I couldn't
[16:35] do anything until I responded to that
[16:38] for that's the call and that's that's
[16:40] how I knew and I tell him honey if it's
[16:42] a real call to God you'll go to the
[16:43] stump and preach to the squirrels okay
[16:45] if you got it you know brother Ben I
[16:47] I've told this a lot of times my granny
[16:49] used to say something that I didn't
[16:52] understand at the time and now I think I
[16:53] do she used to say if you feel like
[16:56] you're called to preach she said you
[16:57] ought to run as hard as you can in the
[16:59] other direction do everything you can to
[17:01] get out of the call right and I thought
[17:03] I'm high that I don't know if that's
[17:04] good advice or not but then she would
[17:06] finish it by saying because if you're
[17:08] really called you'll never get a
[17:10] away from exactly right matter how hard
[17:12] you ruin exactly and so that's that's
[17:14] encouraging to hear that it just
[17:15] increased yes in your life until
[17:17] surrendered how many years ago was it
[17:19] that you would just SEC preaches your
[17:21] first sermon 26 years yeah I was 14
[17:24] years old as 1991 and my first sermon
[17:27] was in a nursing home actually brother
[17:30] the brother there in Ohio that had he
[17:33] was real sensitive young men and trying
[17:36] to help him preach and things and he had
[17:37] actually organized kind of a little um I
[17:40] guess you would call it a tryout in a
[17:42] way in my mind it was kind of a tryout
[17:44] and there was a few brothers there that
[17:47] that had felt a call to preach and and
[17:50] so actually was prior to the nursing
[17:52] home neither thinking so we went into
[17:54] this little Sunday School room and I my
[17:56] first sermon Peter where for did you
[17:58] doubt and I talked about petered out and
[18:01] you know falling down Jesus catching his
[18:02] hand you know and then I turned it
[18:04] around where did you doubt you know it
[18:06] you know what we have the same God he's
[18:08] still in on the water and in the bus
[18:09] right that was pretty impressive for a
[18:11] tryout sermon anyway thank you
[18:15] well it was it was a blessing and then
[18:17] the brother of course he felt like the
[18:19] Lord really done something for me and
[18:21] this is the same man that laid his hands
[18:23] on mama and had prayed that prayer yeah
[18:26] so of course me not knowing that a
[18:28] hundred one hundred percent just that
[18:30] way until many years later I found out
[18:32] it was this brother indeed that prayed
[18:34] that prayer I never really knew who
[18:36] write and just a year so go I I had the
[18:38] privilege of being able to shake his
[18:40] hand and ask him do you remember praying
[18:42] that prayer he said yes I said do you
[18:43] remember what you said he said yes and I
[18:46] just hugged his neck and I said this day
[18:47] that prayer is fulfilling just exactly
[18:52] right and so after that he put me in the
[18:56] nursing homes and then I started
[18:57] preaching there to some of the older
[18:59] folk and and you know most almost bound
[19:01] in wheelchairs and then the Lord would
[19:03] do such powerful tremendous things
[19:05] amongst the elderly we would see him
[19:07] maybe go from the wheelchair or from
[19:09] being even bound in the bed up to a
[19:11] wheelchair unto a walker up to a cane
[19:13] which was tremendous for 95 years and
[19:16] encouraging absolutely so we saw those
[19:19] things in the beginning man it just
[19:21] built our faith and then eventually you
[19:22] know just
[19:23] staying under a good pastorship and
[19:26] staying with the word studying the Bible
[19:28] and making sure we knew where we were we
[19:30] just the Lord increased the Lord opened
[19:32] up doors and as he increased we just
[19:34] kept moving and and now it's become
[19:36] around the world at least one time for
[19:38] me in the last 26 years traveled a lot
[19:40] do you know how many countries you've
[19:41] been there 10 this foreign 13 yeah
[19:44] that's a lot I mean it really is a lot
[19:46] of countries plus you've traveled across
[19:48] the United States oh yeah multiple times
[19:50] oh yes sir yes sir I mean you were just
[19:52] in Connecticut before you came here
[19:53] that's right here I thought you were
[19:55] driving from Tennessee to get here and
[19:57] you drove all the way from Connecticut
[19:58] and when you leave here you've got a
[20:00] long distance to go that's true yeah and
[20:02] so for now you've most of this 26 years
[20:05] you've been fulfilling the commission of
[20:07] an evangelist yes sir
[20:08] yeah yeah mostly yeah I had a little
[20:10] home church for about three years in
[20:11] Ohio we we was in an area where there
[20:14] was a lot of backslidden people and so
[20:16] we worked an area there for about three
[20:18] years trying to reach out to them it was
[20:21] it was a little successful but a little
[20:24] bit more unsuccessful than what I'd
[20:26] hoped we just couldn't get the response
[20:28] we wanted and I was actually on my way
[20:31] back home to my home church when my now
[20:35] pastor in Tennessee had approached me
[20:37] and asked me to come help him there in
[20:39] Tennessee so in May of 2003 I moved to
[20:42] Tennessee and that's when I began
[20:44] full-time ministry which was 14 years
[20:46] ago this May and so before then you were
[20:49] working a little job or doing something
[20:50] yes sir full-time yeah that's right
[20:52] that's right yeah yeah that that's
[20:55] really an incredible track record and
[20:57] you know the best is yet to come and
[20:59] that's what we believe yes sir yeah can
[21:01] I just share with those who are watching
[21:03] one verse of scripture that you preached
[21:07] from last night and can I get you just
[21:09] to take off a little bit
[21:10] I bet just just to speak a little bit
[21:12] about about the mind and the thought
[21:14] this is found in Philippians chapter 3
[21:17] and it's not it's not one of those more
[21:19] remote verses of scripture it's one that
[21:22] we're more familiar with
[21:25] you know I've seen it on greeting cards
[21:27] and things like that and and so maybe it
[21:30] has to become a little more common than
[21:31] it should
[21:32] but how powerful it can be when the
[21:35] enemy is bombarding our minds yes it is
[21:39] chapter four actually Philippians and
[21:41] verse eight finally brethren whatsoever
[21:44] things are true whatsoever things are
[21:47] honest whatsoever things are just
[21:49] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[21:52] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[21:54] of good report if there be any virtue
[21:57] and if there be any praise think on
[22:00] these things
[22:03] tremendous works you share with us about
[22:05] this verse and wherever else you decide
[22:07] to go with yours when I look at this
[22:09] particular verse my mind really it it
[22:13] opens up to to a channel of thought that
[22:15] is not just important I think for
[22:18] Christians but it's important for
[22:20] Humanity right people the and it's it's
[22:23] something that really everybody's
[22:24] acquainted with that is the battle of
[22:26] the minds right and you you see help
[22:29] self-help books you see psychology you
[22:31] see a lot of things working in the way
[22:33] of well you know how do we better
[22:36] ourselves is it positive thinking or is
[22:38] it these type of things and I believe
[22:40] that one of the great mysteries of
[22:42] humanity and if humankind has been what
[22:45] the mind is all about yeah because there
[22:47] are aspects of the mind that a lot of
[22:49] people don't understand right for
[22:50] example with science for a long time
[22:52] couldn't understand why Jesus said as a
[22:53] man thinks in his heart right I said
[22:56] well he thinks it as hard well we don't
[22:57] think in our heart we think in our brain
[22:59] but then they come to find out that
[23:00] that's true that there's a part of us
[23:02] that actually thanks from a different
[23:05] realm than the brain and it is a it is
[23:07] an important thing I believe to really
[23:10] focus in on the beginning of matters of
[23:14] circumstances right and everything
[23:16] begins with the channel of our thinking
[23:18] before a person can even express words
[23:21] it has to enter into the mind first
[23:22] before a person can really make
[23:26] decisions and execute decisions it must
[23:29] come from the realm of meditation of
[23:31] thought and what we put into our minds
[23:34] will be the output of our lives
[23:36] oh yeah and
[23:37] we study and what we how we we view
[23:40] things or how we look at things our
[23:41] vantage point of life it all comes from
[23:44] the mind and Paul here being a great to
[23:49] me Paul was more than just a prophet
[23:51] more than just an apostle but he was a
[23:53] man called of God to really hone in on
[23:56] the primary issue of humanity in
[23:59] Revelation 1 when he starts talking
[24:02] about John starts about the seven
[24:04] personnage of Jesus every every aspect
[24:07] is human human nature the voice of
[24:09] waters that's preaching and the feet of
[24:11] brass the judgment begins at the house
[24:13] of God and Paul was very gifted in being
[24:16] able to go into that element of humanity
[24:18] and pull out those components and show
[24:21] the human side mixed with the Christian
[24:23] side and how both of them work in in
[24:26] tandem the amazing thing about this
[24:28] particular verse is that some people
[24:30] would look at it and say well it's
[24:32] positive thinking actually it's not this
[24:34] is more than positive thank more much
[24:36] more to me I I believe Michelle had that
[24:40] to me this particular verse is speaking
[24:42] to us as believers being able to take
[24:45] the word and put it in the channel of
[24:47] our thinking if Jesus said the word is a
[24:49] seed and we know that it is then the
[24:52] seed must have a bedding ground in order
[24:54] to grow properly and our minds or our
[24:57] thinking is the bedding ground for these
[24:59] for these thoughts and so at whatever a
[25:02] person thinks whatever a person has in
[25:04] their mind that's gonna be what they
[25:07] meditate on what they dwell on that way
[25:09] is gonna be what they manifest it's
[25:12] amazing just just recently with the Las
[25:14] Vegas shootings there's still to this
[25:17] moment trying to get inside the minds
[25:19] actly of the man they don't understand
[25:21] why he did what he did but one thing we
[25:23] know from Scripture is that somewhere
[25:25] there had to be a meditation there had
[25:28] to be something that went over and over
[25:29] and over again in the man's mind to
[25:31] create such evil just just at a moment's
[25:34] spur almost and to to you you know move
[25:39] to such a realm coming by the power of
[25:41] thought well Paul is exhorting us that
[25:45] just as that is negative we can on the
[25:47] positive side
[25:48] we can channel the word in such a way
[25:51] that whatsoever things are true that's
[25:53] powerful and a virtue and of power we
[25:56] can manifest things out of our life
[25:58] through the power of thinking and Peter
[26:01] exhorts us to gird up the loins of our
[26:03] mind and I think it's important to
[26:05] really understand that gird means to
[26:09] well their garments used to be long and
[26:11] flowing they would take straps and time
[26:12] down if they were gonna do work or they
[26:14] were gonna go to battle or what are they
[26:16] gonna do and Peter tells us to gird our
[26:18] minds right because the mind of people
[26:21] today is just it's carte blanche they
[26:24] can think whatever they want
[26:26] run away really completely absolutely
[26:29] completely and there's no real
[26:31] subjugation there's nothing in their
[26:34] minds that really kind of focuses them
[26:36] down on what is true which is what Paul
[26:39] exhorts us to do here find what is true
[26:41] and thank upon these things now the word
[26:44] that Paul uses here for thank is luigi's
[26:46] MO which is where we get the word for a
[26:48] calculation and for reckoning and those
[26:51] type of things so it's more than just a
[26:53] passing thought but it's actually being
[26:55] able to take that and calculate over and
[26:58] over and over and over again and even
[27:00] children when they're learning their
[27:02] ABCs the power of repetition
[27:04] ABCD efg it's the same thing he's saying
[27:08] here so don't just think on it but
[27:10] actually repetitively over and over and
[27:13] over again and taste so just meditate to
[27:15] say absolutely right Wow because if we
[27:17] put all that good in eventually Goods
[27:19] gonna come out yes yes keep going yes
[27:24] sir that's right that's right
[27:25] and so to me I think it's it's important
[27:28] to really to put a little focus to on
[27:30] what Jesus said that as a man thinks in
[27:33] his heart so is he
[27:34] what our thoughts are is what our
[27:36] character is going to be take a person
[27:39] that meditates on depressing type things
[27:42] or even if they're sick in their body
[27:44] and you know how it is when you start
[27:45] getting sick absolutely you're thinking
[27:47] I'm sick I'm sick I'm sick that thought
[27:49] is in your mind but I do believe that if
[27:52] we can push out them thoughts and it
[27:54] will take God's grace and it will take
[27:55] us surrender ourselves to the Holy
[27:57] Spirit to get to the place to where we
[28:00] can really push
[28:01] we can't do this on our own strength no
[28:03] the devil is too powerful in himself too
[28:05] convincing he has too much understanding
[28:08] in biblical things he's too smart too
[28:11] shrewd for us to try to whip him with
[28:13] her own brain right but with the grace
[28:15] of God moving in our hearts and
[28:17] surrendering ourselves to truth then
[28:20] we're having the ability then to say
[28:22] Lord now I surrender my thoughts to you
[28:24] as quoting last night a certain spot of
[28:27] science that said 70 thousand thoughts
[28:29] crossed through the average human brain
[28:32] you know and that's that's just
[28:35] exponentially speaking that just grows
[28:38] and grows and grows once you get past is
[28:40] that in the course of a day one day one
[28:42] day Wow
[28:43] then by day two it's a hundred and forty
[28:45] thousand and then you just keep doing
[28:46] the math I mean it's incredible to think
[28:49] about the battlefield of the mind
[28:51] because the mind is it's the place where
[28:54] Satan wants to go before he goes
[28:56] anywhere else it was where he went in
[28:59] the Garden of Eden right he went to
[29:00] Eve's mind he began to work on her
[29:02] through thoughts through the power of
[29:04] suggestion exactly which is dangerous
[29:06] yeah suggestions always got to be
[29:07] brought back to the word to make sure it
[29:09] lines up with the word that's a very
[29:11] good statement people people have a lot
[29:12] of problems with suggestive behavior yes
[29:15] yeah suggestive thinking and people can
[29:18] send messages without saying a word
[29:20] that's true because the mind can get a
[29:22] hold of it just like that there's a
[29:24] certain book I read of fella by name of
[29:27] Martin Lindstrom and he talked about the
[29:29] power of marketing and just the human
[29:31] brain and how the brain and marketing go
[29:33] together and he spoke about how that a
[29:36] man looking at just a red race car or a
[29:38] red the type of fading out sunset by
[29:43] looking at that if he was a smoker would
[29:45] automatically think about Marvel
[29:46] cigarettes without even the word being
[29:48] put before him because that's like the
[29:50] color of the package or something
[29:51] exactly Wow
[29:52] this is the advertisement they use they
[29:54] use racecars and sunsets and these type
[29:56] of things so it's like association
[29:58] exactly and that suggestion sent the
[30:01] message without even putting words in
[30:03] front of them that's pretty interesting
[30:04] and that's where we are today the mind
[30:06] is bombarded was suggestive ideas I mean
[30:10] you can look at Facebook you can look at
[30:12] Twitter you can look at all
[30:13] these things that are out there today
[30:15] social media of every kind
[30:17] not to mention television not to mention
[30:19] radio or any kind of media has the
[30:22] ability to send messages to us even
[30:24] though it may not say a specific thing
[30:26] the devil uses that but that's why that
[30:30] is Christians we must bring our minds
[30:32] back to this word because then Jesus
[30:34] tells us let every man's word be a lie
[30:36] but let mine be the truth right and then
[30:39] that's what Paul said here whatsoever
[30:40] things are true
[30:42] she's assigned the truth and I am the
[30:45] life so in order to get to truth as
[30:48] Pilate asked Jesus what is history we
[30:50] got to know what the word is is truth
[30:52] that's what we're supposed to meditate
[30:54] upon it it would be easy for us in this
[30:56] day and age to meditate upon all the
[30:58] negative there's truth there tons that's
[31:00] exactly right and it gets worse every
[31:02] year and and it's not going to get any
[31:04] better it'll get worse and worse and
[31:06] even what the Bible tells us that evil
[31:08] men and seducers and things of that
[31:10] nature will wax worse and worse plumb to
[31:12] the coming of the Lord Jesus and it'll
[31:15] come to a place to where that it'll be
[31:17] as it was in the days of Noah I think
[31:19] we've already arrived where the
[31:20] imagination of every man's thoughts yes
[31:23] are already on evil yeah they can't
[31:25] think anything good because they're
[31:26] always meditating on the evil side but
[31:29] that's why the Paul gives us such a
[31:31] beautiful commandment here to think to
[31:33] calculate to reckon to compute keep
[31:36] these things going in our mind all the
[31:38] time about what the Word teaches us if
[31:41] you think you're an overcomer
[31:42] you'll be an overcomer if you can thank
[31:44] in your mind and it's not so much mind
[31:46] over matter
[31:47] as much as it is surrendering our mind
[31:49] to the word that's what makes the big
[31:51] difference which of course we have to be
[31:53] familiar with the word yes be able to
[31:55] replace our negative thoughts with the
[31:57] word absolutely so let me understand
[31:59] you're you're sharing that thinking on
[32:02] these good things pure things lovely
[32:05] things it's not automatic in other words
[32:08] you're teaching us that it is a
[32:10] calculated decision yes sir absolutely
[32:12] that we have to choose rather than
[32:14] thinking on all of the other things that
[32:16] that we say the enemy but a lot of it is
[32:20] the enemy is using me
[32:21] sure is and even entertainment you know
[32:23] thinking about what people call
[32:25] entertainment and and how that that a
[32:27] lot of people walk away from from modern
[32:29] entertainment depressed or angry or
[32:32] upset absolutely and and I thought by
[32:35] definition that to entertain was to us
[32:38] to please you know to it to make someone
[32:41] happy and to feel good one would thank
[32:43] you but really entertainment today is
[32:45] not always about that it touches every
[32:49] emotion and I think it can leave people
[32:52] in really a bad place certainly so
[32:54] really we need to be filled with the
[32:56] Word of God and we have to understand
[32:58] that it is a decision to replace
[33:00] absolutely to reject a negative thoughts
[33:04] what what about what about Satan's
[33:06] accusations I mean certainly he's
[33:08] constantly whispering Sharia so how do
[33:11] we handle he wants to disqualify us he
[33:15] accuses us how do we how should the
[33:17] Christian today handle that constant
[33:20] bombarding accusation from our enemy
[33:22] certainly III look at that kind of
[33:25] through the life of David you know as
[33:27] far as a man that had as much
[33:30] complication in life as a fellow could
[33:32] have
[33:32] David had it not only did he have
[33:34] whisperings from the kingdom but he had
[33:36] you know he had quite a few wives and
[33:38] children to deal with at the same time
[33:40] and he had a lot of problems and the
[33:42] devil was always working on David in
[33:44] some way the book of Psalm Psalms really
[33:47] gives us a view a real good setting into
[33:51] how that a man can train his mind or a
[33:53] woman for that matter into into blocking
[33:56] out the noise because to me I think the
[33:59] the key of really getting our mind quiet
[34:01] is we have to learn to quieten voices
[34:04] for example a person that falls into
[34:06] depression and I'm sure that there'll be
[34:08] people that will view this little talk
[34:11] and they'll be able to relate with the
[34:13] fact that they've been so deep they've
[34:16] considered suicide they've considered
[34:18] sure some violent act of some sort
[34:21] because if they really just stop and
[34:23] think for a moment there's so much noise
[34:25] going on in the brain so much what the
[34:28] psychology calls self-talk and they're
[34:30] constantly talking to themself about
[34:32] certain things
[34:33] I could say from my mouth to you oh I'm
[34:36] fine but my self talk will always tell
[34:38] the truth on Wow inside of me I'm saying
[34:41] but no I'm not you know I'm not really
[34:42] fine well and that that's what we have
[34:44] to get down to is we have to learn to
[34:46] listen to the one singular voice that
[34:49] will drive out all the noise and we kind
[34:53] of have to listen to ourself a little
[34:54] bit you know not what we say but what
[34:57] we're thinking in ourself we have to
[34:58] kind of stop and take time to really
[35:01] kind of listen at our own heart and and
[35:03] what do I really believe about me yeah
[35:05] and then take what we believe and see if
[35:08] it lines up with the word because the
[35:10] devil is a liar I mean bottom line Satan
[35:12] never going to tell you the truth if he
[35:13] comes with no truth that's twisted in
[35:15] some way anyways so really really we
[35:18] have one measuring stick and that's if
[35:20] we can bring things back to the
[35:21] scripture to identify what is real truth
[35:25] again to say what is truth now by that
[35:27] but that being said here's where I think
[35:30] it really gets complicated for some
[35:31] folks because we don't want to work hard
[35:34] enough sometimes as Christians to get
[35:37] ourselves down to that place to where
[35:39] all the voices are drowned out it's too
[35:41] hard it's too much if it seems like work
[35:43] it's very much work absolutely and so
[35:47] some people just give up but I will say
[35:50] that with some presence and with some
[35:53] determination and consecrating your
[35:55] heart and dedicating determining in your
[35:57] heart that you want to know what is
[36:00] right then then I think that as each
[36:04] voice would come taking that voice going
[36:07] back to the Bible okay says Satan says
[36:09] I'm not saved but then going back into
[36:12] acts 2:38 repent be baptized in the name
[36:14] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[36:16] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[36:18] the Holy Ghost if I've done that right
[36:20] if I've met God's requirement well then
[36:22] I can just shut that voice off not
[36:25] listen to it anymore meditate upon that
[36:27] I've done what God said
[36:29] God's obligated to his word he'll do
[36:31] what he says in his word he's the same
[36:33] yesterday today and forever and as we
[36:35] meditate on that it quietens that other
[36:37] voice out exactly I mean yes it's the
[36:39] same thing with sickness for example if
[36:41] you're thinking I'm sick I'm sick I'm
[36:42] sick your self-talk is I'm sick but if
[36:45] you'll just say
[36:46] his stripes I am healed by His stripes I
[36:48] am healed by His stripes I am healed and
[36:50] you just keep that thought in your mind
[36:51] eventually it'll quiet not that other
[36:54] voice and so the word has that kind of
[36:56] power
[36:57] Wow the word will absolutely push out
[36:59] all of these other thoughts because
[37:01] light always scatters darkness anyways
[37:03] and always pushes it off into a corner
[37:05] exactly and it's difficult it's not an
[37:07] easy task it won't happen today it won't
[37:09] happen tomorrow you know I really like
[37:11] something that you said the other night
[37:12] I don't think it was in the in the
[37:14] sermon particularly about thoughts but
[37:16] you said something about making baby
[37:18] steps and making steps yes how important
[37:21] is that in a situation like this where
[37:23] it begins to feel like work yes you know
[37:25] if I'm gonna wrestle every thought that
[37:27] I have and I'm gonna submit it to the
[37:29] truth of God's Word I'm gonna be busy
[37:31] that happened 70,000 times a day
[37:34] absolutely and and so people I think I
[37:37] mean myself I've gotten overwhelmed when
[37:39] I knew the enemy was trying to steal my
[37:41] joy right and you start confessing with
[37:44] faith the right things and and then you
[37:47] you're quiet you're not thinking good
[37:49] thoughts or speaking good words the next
[37:51] thing you know all that negative comes
[37:52] back you can feel the joy leaving again
[37:55] so you feel overwhelmed and discouraged
[37:56] but what I've learned is if I will be
[37:59] consistent exact with the small things
[38:01] exactly so talk just a little bit about
[38:03] those those making small steps certainly
[38:07] you know and that can be encouraging if
[38:08] you see some measurable results sure
[38:11] absolutely I think it's very encouraging
[38:13] to know that this is a race this is a
[38:17] marathon it's not a sprint
[38:18] yeah it's a marathon it's a long term
[38:20] long haul and what we have to realize I
[38:22] think is that sometimes our faith
[38:25] doesn't latch in the beginning I heard a
[38:29] story one time about a woman who
[38:31] couldn't have a baby her husband wanted
[38:32] one she couldn't have a baby and so she
[38:35] adopted a baby and after just maybe a
[38:39] year or two years of taking this small
[38:41] child and mothering this child doctors
[38:44] found out that it gave her confidence
[38:46] that she could actually reproduce
[38:48] herself and within a couple years she
[38:51] actually did that
[38:52] and so I like to call it the adopted
[38:56] baby route and I say that if a person if
[38:59] their faith can't get it at first if
[39:01] they'll just take the adopt just put the
[39:05] word in there and just keep going and
[39:07] going and going and confessing and
[39:09] speaking hallelujah and not back up and
[39:11] not back up that's the key the minute
[39:13] you back up
[39:14] Satan's on you like white on rice and
[39:16] and you can't do it you just got to keep
[39:18] pressing forward
[39:19] if you ever stop that's where you fail
[39:21] because the Bible tells us give not
[39:23] space yes you know granny said give him
[39:26] an inch he'll take a mile it's bigger
[39:28] than that now sir oh yeah yeah I mean
[39:30] yeah I that is so powerful so so the
[39:35] results of the story is that by by
[39:38] having confidence I have I can mother
[39:42] sure I can nurture sure you're saying
[39:45] that the testimony is that that had a
[39:49] absolutely effect on her solutely yeah
[39:51] because the confidence builder was was
[39:54] the thing that helped her body come into
[39:56] the reproductive cycle you know dad no
[39:58] comment that's not just standing in the
[40:00] mirror in front of mirror and saying you
[40:02] know I'm good-looking I'm I can conquer
[40:04] everything you know
[40:07] hey you good-looking thing I can make it
[40:09] today we're not talking about just what
[40:12] some people might call unrealistic
[40:14] realities or unrealistic optimism that's
[40:18] mind over matter
[40:19] right but we're talking about taking God
[40:21] at His Word absolutely yeah
[40:23] it's some somehow important to to
[40:26] recognize that there is an answer for
[40:30] every situation we face in God's Word
[40:32] yes but it will seem like just words on
[40:35] a page right without the Spirit of God
[40:38] to reveal it and make it real to us
[40:40] that's I wanted you to talk for a moment
[40:42] about how much more effective it is when
[40:46] you're when you're battling the enemy or
[40:48] overcoming thoughts with a revelation
[40:50] absolutely instead of just you know
[40:52] looking for a verse to read and and just
[40:55] trying to speak it even though you don't
[40:56] believe it there is a an element of
[40:58] faith well certainly yeah and I think
[41:00] first for everybody
[41:02] think it comes mentally first it comes
[41:04] through that kind of dryer channel of I
[41:06] hear it okay it's words and but I think
[41:10] that it comes to a place to where we
[41:12] have to we have to start building our
[41:15] faith by just just believe simply
[41:19] believe and it's just a common regular
[41:21] belief just simply like you get in your
[41:24] car you start your car because you got
[41:25] confidence that's going to start yeah
[41:27] you walk down the road and and and and
[41:30] walk into a store and say hello and
[41:32] you're not worried about whether you're
[41:33] gonna make it home or not you just got
[41:35] regular central faith automatic and you
[41:37] just do that with the word you just you
[41:39] just tell yourself initially and you
[41:42] have to talk to yourself you have to
[41:43] tell yourself okay this is God's Word
[41:46] and I'm gonna believe it with all of my
[41:48] heart and then I think once and here's
[41:50] the key once you make a commitment to
[41:53] the Lord and God sees that you're
[41:55] serious about what what you what you're
[41:57] reading about what you're studying then
[41:59] I feel the Holy Spirit answers back to
[42:01] that because for all of us it starts
[42:04] kind of just by reading or hearing even
[42:07] in the book of Romans he talked about
[42:08] you know you hear the gospel you hear it
[42:11] through preaching but it but faith faith
[42:15] cometh by the hearing of the word Wow so
[42:18] as we hear it as we read it as we study
[42:21] we make a commitment that this is God's
[42:24] for exactly Drive our doubts out and
[42:26] then I feel the Holy Spirit answers back
[42:28] to that then the Bible tells us that
[42:30] once Christ sees our commitment because
[42:34] remember in in Ephesians 1 Paul talks
[42:36] about after you heard the word of truth
[42:38] right you were sealed with the Holy
[42:40] Spirit Brian right so you hear it first
[42:42] you make a commitment to what's right
[42:44] first you dedicate and surrender
[42:45] yourself to what's right first then the
[42:47] Holy Spirit answers back to that by the
[42:51] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost once
[42:53] that happens in a person's heart once
[42:55] they're saved once they're filled with
[42:56] the Holy Spirit once all of the doubts
[42:59] and things are drove out of a man's
[43:01] heart woman's heart and Christ enters in
[43:03] there then he begins to speak revelation
[43:07] to you oh that you didn't understand
[43:09] I'll give you an idea what revelation
[43:10] looks like if I use the word board
[43:13] just the English word board could have a
[43:16] bunch of different meanings
[43:18] it could be plank board it could be
[43:20] committee board Deacon board it could be
[43:22] somebody sitting in church on board has
[43:24] many meanings to it but revelation is is
[43:28] if me and you before I said board
[43:30] somewhere privately I come to you and I
[43:32] say brother Steve I'm talking about a
[43:34] deacon board oh well then I come out and
[43:36] say board right well other people can
[43:38] draw thoughts but you know directly what
[43:41] I mean because I spoke it to you and I
[43:43] feel the word is the same way it's a
[43:45] good point once a person enters into the
[43:47] Holy Ghost once they make a commitment
[43:50] to the truth and they make a commitment
[43:51] to serve God then God starts answering
[43:54] back through his word and reveals to
[43:56] them what the meaning of it is what the
[43:58] thought even is behind what he says
[43:59] that's why we have so many different
[44:01] organizations and things because man
[44:03] puts his own thought to what he thinks
[44:05] right but when the word is being
[44:07] revealed to a person you can see things
[44:10] in the scripture that other people can't
[44:11] see you can understand what holiness is
[44:14] you can understand what baptism is Sam
[44:16] in the Lord Jesus you can understand the
[44:20] Godhead you can understand deep things
[44:22] of the scripture because the Bible said
[44:24] you have a spiritual mind comparing
[44:27] spiritual with spiritual right yes not
[44:29] carnal with spiritual but spiritual with
[44:32] spiritual that's a difference and
[44:33] commitment is the main thing if a person
[44:35] will commit themselves to the word and
[44:37] fully commit their heart to the Lord and
[44:39] said Jesus I believe this is your word
[44:42] and with all of my heart I commit myself
[44:44] to it yeah I believe God answers back
[44:46] and I think that's the real key of
[44:48] getting us there
[44:49] it all comes the same way we all have
[44:51] two years hopefully and and we all hear
[44:54] it on our eardrums and so forth and but
[44:56] there has to be a real commitment in the
[44:58] person's heart if they let go and let
[45:00] God then the Lord Jesus will do a work
[45:02] for them that they can't do there's
[45:04] nothing we can do ourselves we used to
[45:06] hear people talk about seeing themselves
[45:08] in the word you know realizing that it's
[45:11] not just for God so loved the world but
[45:14] it's God so loved me he asked me man
[45:16] what what what role do you think that
[45:19] plays now I mean and how do we get to
[45:21] that place yes that we can see our sail
[45:23] in the word sure I think first we have
[45:26] to take the word personally I think we
[45:28] have to realize that the Bible wasn't
[45:29] wrote to just people but it was wrote to
[45:31] individuals that it's a love letter that
[45:34] Jesus would write to an individual and
[45:36] it is similar to a story that I heard
[45:39] told many years ago there was to two
[45:42] people on a ship sailing down the ocean
[45:45] man by the name of John Court neither
[45:46] one by the name of William Tell John
[45:48] Court was dying he's an old ship captain
[45:50] and he was a sinner but William Tell was
[45:52] a Christian and he heard him reading his
[45:55] Bible and he said hey he said that
[45:58] sounds pretty good to me
[45:59] he said he said I'm awful bad shape I
[46:02] need some help
[46:03] William Tell said to John Court would
[46:05] you like me to read the scripture the
[46:06] way my mom already read it said yes he
[46:08] was reading Isaiah and he said by His
[46:11] stripes William tail would tell was
[46:13] healed by hit you know and so forth like
[46:15] that
[46:16] John said can you read my name in there
[46:18] he said I'll try so he said by his
[46:20] stripes on court he how I see it I see
[46:22] it and the Holy Ghost healed him I think
[46:25] the key is is that you have to take it
[46:27] personally you have to realize that when
[46:29] it says you y-o-u that's talking to you
[46:31] when it says us you got to put yourself
[46:34] in there if you're not willing just to
[46:36] see yourself that way God can't show you
[46:39] that way you have to be willing to see
[46:41] it first it's easy for people to say oh
[46:43] that's good for somebody else right but
[46:45] you and and brother I really personally
[46:48] believe that we have to be aggressive
[46:50] when it comes to these things because
[46:52] the Bible said the kingdom of God
[46:54] suffers violence and the violent take it
[46:56] by force
[46:56] hey we must be aggressive with these
[46:59] things if we just passively well maybe
[47:02] it's that way sort of it'll never make
[47:04] the grade you have to be so aggressive
[47:06] in there and say hey that's talking
[47:08] about me a thought comes no it's not
[47:10] shove it out that's talking about me if
[47:13] we're aggressive enough and I believe if
[47:15] we we push to for that commitment and we
[47:18] push to be committed then I think the
[47:20] Holy Spirit honors that I believe God
[47:22] honors that and one thing's for certain
[47:24] is that when a person wants to see
[47:27] themselves in the scripture if there's a
[47:30] desire in them to see it then God's the
[47:33] only one that could have put that
[47:34] first place yes and so he already sees
[47:36] that that desires there so everywhere
[47:39] they look he's going to show it to him
[47:41] because I believe the Bible is like a
[47:42] looking-glass yeah and I believe if we
[47:45] look and we're really looking right we
[47:46] can see it but there's a little
[47:48] something about that do we have time to
[47:50] share us that was in the book of James
[47:53] when he talks about a man beholding his
[47:56] reflection and then he goes away
[47:57] forgetting what manner of man he is to
[47:59] me this kind of ties in to the
[48:01] commitment part to prezerv Verint to
[48:04] being aggressive the the historical
[48:06] version of that when you look at
[48:08] different men that wrote about this
[48:11] particular looking-glass it wasn't as of
[48:14] today we have mirrors at eye level and
[48:16] we pretty much can go around our house
[48:18] and see our reflection everywhere but in
[48:21] this time period they actually placed
[48:23] the mirror on the ground oh and so for a
[48:25] person to see themself they had to stoop
[48:28] down all the way to the ground in order
[48:30] to be able to catch the reflection so
[48:32] when they stood back up then of course
[48:34] they would forget what manner of man
[48:36] because they didn't have things at eye
[48:38] level so the only way to see it again
[48:39] you had to stoop back down this is what
[48:42] Jesus told us and this is a big key and
[48:44] what we're talking about this afternoon
[48:45] if a man will humble himself as Peter
[48:48] said humble yourself therefore under the
[48:50] mighty hand of God he will exalt you in
[48:52] due time
[48:53] but you have to humble first and if a
[48:56] person is not willing to kneel and not
[48:58] willing to humble themselves and lower
[49:00] themselves so that they can look in the
[49:02] word to see themselves they'll never
[49:04] really see themselves but then the Bible
[49:06] goes on the st. James tells us that as a
[49:08] man continues to behold himself even
[49:11] Paul said we look through a glass darkly
[49:13] but eventually we begin to see where the
[49:16] reflection comes clear we remember what
[49:18] our nose look like remember what our
[49:19] ears look like remember the features of
[49:21] our face the characteristics of our hair
[49:24] and what right and it comes through
[49:26] humility humbling ourselves down and to
[49:29] me the best way to see yourself in the
[49:32] scripture is at the foot of the old
[49:34] rugged cross right kneeling down to see
[49:36] Jesus who was crucified Jesus who gave
[49:39] himself for us the highest of the high
[49:41] became a foot wash monkey yeah
[49:44] the lowest of the low to be spit on to
[49:46] be called a dog to be called everything
[49:48] that was to be called and yet that great
[49:50] savior a man come all the way down and
[49:54] stooped stooped all the way down so that
[49:57] he could exalt and that's what we have
[50:00] to do it's easy to say well I'm just
[50:02] gonna take the Bible and just memorize
[50:04] some scriptures that's true you can do
[50:06] that that's possible if you've got the
[50:07] human instrumentality you can do it but
[50:10] it takes that element of humility to
[50:13] humble yourself to a Bible that may rub
[50:16] you the wrong way a little bit
[50:17] it could you sure enough and scriptures
[50:19] that make kind of pinch you a little bit
[50:21] from time to time exactly there's things
[50:23] I read in here when I was a boy and and
[50:26] and hey hey man I knew I knew I wouldn't
[50:28] line it up but I humbled myself to it I
[50:31] said God this is your word you know
[50:33] what's best for me you have my best
[50:36] interest in your mind so I'm gonna
[50:38] follow that to the best civility by
[50:40] stooping down by humbling myself by
[50:42] putting myself last making sure God was
[50:46] first because that's what the Bible says
[50:47] seek ye first the kingdom of God and all
[50:50] these other things will be added if
[50:51] we're not willing to humble ourself to
[50:53] the word we can never be exalted we can
[50:55] never achieve that place of seeing
[50:58] ourself in the word and saying hey I'm
[51:00] one of them I'm one of them
[51:02] it takes humility it takes a commitment
[51:05] it takes being aggressive it takes being
[51:07] able to dedicate ourselves and it takes
[51:10] a little precedence if we're not willing
[51:12] to fight for it we'll never earn it
[51:13] because the crown doesn't come to those
[51:15] who just set and receive and the battles
[51:18] worth it i mean the the victory that's
[51:20] promised amen and even the victory that
[51:22] we feel when we overcome something that
[51:24] the enemy has put us through or put us
[51:27] in or and walked into stumbled into and
[51:29] when we overcome it it's worth it yes
[51:31] sir absolutely an eternity it will
[51:33] really be man that's right I think our
[51:36] time has probably come to an end for now
[51:38] but I tell you this is this is going
[51:40] pretty fast for me I've enjoyed
[51:42] listening to it thank you and I mean
[51:44] that and it's inspiring and it's true
[51:46] and it's the word and it works thank you
[51:48] my brother my heart keeps going back to
[51:51] to the anger
[51:52] yes that you had when you were a child
[51:54] yes and I don't know how severe the
[51:57] things were that you encountered in life
[52:00] but it sounds like the anger that you
[52:02] had was was probably in proportionate
[52:06] that maybe it was even over the top an
[52:10] added measure to anything that you
[52:12] experienced that would have made you
[52:13] that angry certainly and I think that
[52:15] anger is all around us that's right I
[52:17] think that it explains a lot of what's
[52:19] going on in the world and I just sense
[52:22] that there are probably people watching
[52:24] this today who who fight that kind of
[52:26] anger maybe even even it's really mean
[52:28] you said that you had a touch from the
[52:30] Lord and as a child and and you you knew
[52:34] there was something real and yet that
[52:35] anger was there and even increased
[52:37] certainly so there may be someone
[52:39] watching this who has confessed the Lord
[52:41] Jesus as their Savior who has started a
[52:44] Christian journey maybe been walking a
[52:47] journey for a long time and still
[52:49] dealing with that anger I'd like to ask
[52:51] you to look in that camera and pray I
[52:55] will and and agree and I'm gonna agree
[52:57] with you because I would like to see
[52:59] people free I I think that anger and and
[53:02] a temper like that it eats you from the
[53:05] inside out
[53:06] along with unforgiveness and all the
[53:08] other other absolutely you know things
[53:10] that go along with that and I liked I'd
[53:12] like to believe that people can be free
[53:15] absolutely and that I know that perfect
[53:18] love casteth out all fear amen and I
[53:20] believe that if people can accept the
[53:22] perfect love of God for us the son Jesus
[53:25] Christ that all that anger can be dealt
[53:28] with absolutely you know you're a very
[53:30] passionate preacher and a very intense
[53:33] person thing with a good sense of humor
[53:35] by the way but but it's hard for me to
[53:38] imagine I mean you're so far removed
[53:41] from the place you described that it's
[53:44] hard for me to even imagine that that
[53:45] was ever you and that's what Jesus can
[53:48] do yes sir that's what a real born-again
[53:50] experience can do separate us absolutely
[53:52] were who we were so would you pray let
[53:56] me have you to speak to that a moment
[53:57] and then
[53:58] pray I learned this one thing that anger
[54:00] is a deep-seated something of you
[54:04] wanting things to change but you can't
[54:06] make them change and that's what anger
[54:08] is really at the core Wow
[54:10] it's that desire to want to change
[54:12] something and you just can't change it
[54:13] powerless to shape our lists to change
[54:15] and and so it's a frustration in that
[54:17] way and so my encouragement to everybody
[54:21] watching is that you know you you have
[54:24] to realize at some point in your life
[54:26] that only God can change things
[54:28] sometimes there are things out of our
[54:30] control
[54:31] but I want to pray and ask the Lord to
[54:33] just right now touch anybody that would
[54:36] be in this place that would be in a
[54:38] condition where their minds and their
[54:40] hearts are absolutely just riddled yes
[54:43] anger and with okay maybe fear or
[54:46] depression and if you're here listening
