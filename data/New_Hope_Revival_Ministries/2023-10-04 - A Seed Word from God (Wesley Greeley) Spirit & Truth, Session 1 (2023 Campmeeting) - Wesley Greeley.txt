assured by the holy spirit all through the day that she didn't go in alone there were those who had come very near Hallelujah had come very near so that she would not Wonder not even a minute where she was they came to get her Hallelujah I'm so thankful for it so thankful I had a great conversation with Sister Williams on the phone this morning and uh she was so strong in that moment and we want to lift her up to the Lord in prayer we will see her before the week is out uh she was thanking God for every opportunity that he gave her while in hospice to give out a book of John has she ever given you a book of John and uh she gives them out all the time and and as she was leaving yesterday she got to give it to the last nurse that she wanted and that was the nurse that came when when they called for uh for them to come in when royel had had crossed over and uh what a wonderful thing to know she planted the gospel in their hand and she was just rejoicing in that so we want to go to the Lord in prayer there are those traveling there's a family uh arriving this late this evening from Tucson uh we have another friend coming from Tucson in a few days right now at this moment brother

is unsurpassed Lord I thank you for that we celebrate her life among us and we thank you that your timing is right it is perfect perhaps it has crossed all of our minds that this was not a convenient time but we say that it was a perfect time it was God's time it was the right time we say that it was a weighty matter in your mind and you did not take her at this hour just in vain it was for a purpose and for a reason and may it accomplish all that you intend for it to accomplish may we never be in your way but may we remain in the flow and we will give you praise and honor and glory for

hear when the note come they made it safe then I knew you'd be here now you can clap for them brother Chris and sister Anita in the back let's welcome [Music] them well my goodness I didn't even see her behind sister Ronda there lilan Lily God bless you we're so glad to have you from Idaho I didn't never I I was looking right there and never saw her see I need help is there anybody else I miss brother gritty tell me if I did you know what we're glad to have you here uh we really are uh I want to ask you to pray about something that we didn't mention in the prayer request I don't want to exactly call it out because I don't want the enemy to have any room whatsoever to work but all of you know that we have lost the lease the 20 plus year lease on our apartment in Jerusalem and when I sent word today we have we have uh we have the apartment until the 28th of February we're very thankful for the time that we have left with it and of course brother Benny and uh fredman and his wife Naomi and their three children and mother-in-law right now are very glad that God has made a way for them to have a place to stay these years when I send him notice to let him know that I would be booking a ticket in the next few days uh to be there the last week of October and the first week of November to start going through a mountain of stuff the the basement if you've ever been in the basement you know how big it is brother Magnuson has been and it's piled to the ceiling and up the stairs because when we when we moved out of one apartment and combined two apartments worth of furniture into one we didn't have any storage so we just made storage Jonathan and it's piled to the ceiling and I see it almost every night in the middle of the night in my mind and it has really really caused a lot of concern when I sent the note to tell him we were going to be there he let me know what the arrangements would be and uh then he let me know that that there has been a slight turn in the situation and he was only notified of it most recently and may I just say that it could be amazing and it could be toward our advantage may I just say that and nothing else hopefully before the camp meeting is over I'll be able to let you know I feel the call to Jerusalem like like I haven't felt in years and so I will be going the Lord willing the end of of October anyway because there's a lot to start doing in the process but I want you to pray like wild people I mean like like holy ghost uh what do I want to say I I I don't know Warriors like Holy Ghost Warriors and ask the Lord for favor and to make a way where there seems to be no way we're having a hard time finding another place especially large enough like we have now it seems like we have a perfect place and uh we need God to move but I think he's moving I think he's moving I think he's moving and what a great day to hear about it after 5:00 this afternoon before the message came so God is good one more announcement let me make this before we before we receive the offering tonight and that is there will be a memorial service here at New Hope on Monday evening at 6: p.m and this is for the family and the friends and the loved ones of sister Royale and uh her sisters will be here and uh it will be a very special time we're doing it in the evening because Sister Williams thought about all those who work and wouldn't be able to come and uh where where uh her daughter's uh especially uh Joy now is living in Tennessee I don't know if you know this or not I'm sure brother gley does but they have all of their funerals all of their memorials at night in the evening so that people can come from work and then they normally do a burial the next day and you know for church folks that works pretty good so I was so glad when the news came now I know right now you're thinking you're thinking come Monday you ain't going to want to move but you going to move God's going to strengthen you to move and uh here's what I think I think we'll just be kind of extending camp meeting one night and we'll just come and celebrate no one loved the presence of the Lord that more than royal jelly sister royel and it will be a great honor to come here and let her family know how much she has meant to us I've been her pastor they've lived here for 31 years I've been her pastor about 32 years I'd say that's a long time I'm so thankful that God has released her from the pain she's in a new body reminds me of that reminds me of that old song said I looked at my hands and my hands look new I looked at my feet and they did too Hallelujah everything changes when he touches you well if you think that is true Everything Changes when you step out of time and into eternity we're Eternal people we're only living

more Jesus Jesus preious Jesus Oh for Grace to trust him more oh for Grace to trust him more [Music] you find him trustworthy tonight oh I can trust [Applause] him Hallelujah while you're on your feet tonight I would like to read from Isaiah chapter 55 I have sought the Lord to try to find what he would have for tonight you're going to notice some things this evening one of which is a scripture that I start with is one that our pastor preached on not very long ago a little later on you're going to find that I'm going to be talking about something that doesn't even seem to be seasoned for but I couldn't get away from it so here we are verse 6 Isaiah chapter 55 seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth in Bud that it may give seed to the S and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whet I sent it for you shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands instead of the thorn shall come up the fur tree and instead of the Brier shall come up the Myrtle tree and it shall be to the Lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off before you're seated let's pray once again yes sir Our Father what a privilege it is to be gathered together with the saints of God and I Want to Thank You Lord that they come in with praise we just come in to glorify you for you're worthy to be praised and Lord we have expectation in this holy convocation that you have set aside for us and we've come Lord to hear from heaven we want to hear what you have to say so we're asking Lord that you'll just hide the vessel and that you will fill my mouth with your word Lord that it will come out with power and demonst ation words of Deliverance Lord even as the word is preached that it would be words of Deliverance for your people Lord I pray that even though I may have some notes that you will come and do what you want to in the house tonight and may you get glory and honor for it is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may have your seats tonight tonight praise God we read through a scripture like this and we see where that the Lord speaks to us that that uh he says my thoughts are not your thoughts and your ways are not my ways and and he tells us that as the heaven is higher than the earth my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts are higher than your thoughts and in and in time past probably we have pre preached a message on this and drove home uh the the the thought that we'll never get any higher than we are but that we don't want to think on that kind of a level because even though his ways are higher than our ways and his thoughts are higher than our thoughts we know that he has promised us in the end time that we have the mind of Christ we don't have to uh remain bowed down and say we're never going to go any higher because because he is beckoning us to come up higher he doesn't want us to remain in the place where we are and then he wants us to be so saturated with himself that we go higher and higher and higher he didn't tell us this so that we would sit down and quit he told us this because inside of us he planted something that desired more of him and because we desire more of him we are constantly looking for his ways and we are constantly reaching after his thoughts because we know that our thoughts are on a low plane and we don't want to remain on a low plane we desire to get on a higher plane than we are right now and then he comes on and he says that as the rain and the snow come down from heaven it brings forth water so that the seed that is in the ground would bring forth enough seed that it would give to the sers so he could plant another crop and not only enough seed to plant another crop but so that there would be enough to sustain him with the bread that he would need through the coming year through the winter months through the time when there would be no harvest the Harvest would be done and passed and so then there wouldn't be necessity to have grain to be able to grind to have bread to be able to uh be able to eat but we always want to have the seed for the next crop because we don't want to be left when we get time to plant that there's nothing to plant if a farmer were to plant a crop and he put one seed in the ground and up out of the earth came a plant and all that that seed produced was one more seed what would be the use of planting what a waste of time right but God has a a way by planting one seed that when a plant comes up there is a multiplication of that seed and out of that seed it brings forth a a multiplied number so that there's enough to keep for next planting and there's enough to make bread throughout the year and then he goes on to say this scripture that brother Shelly preached from not so very long ago so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth let me pause here the word that comes out of God's mouth is not a single word that's going to come back a single word when the word goes out of God's mouth there is going to be a multiplication of that word there's going to be a a bigger number than it was when it went out of his mouth so shall my word be there's going to be a a planting of a seed and there's going to be a watering of the seed and when that seed comes up out of the ground it's going to be that there is going to be a multiplication so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I send it yes sir if you read verse 11 in the Amplified it reads this way so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth it shall not return to me void without producing any effect useless but it shall accomplish that which I please and purpose and it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it sir so when God speaks a word his words are not useless words we have been known to spout out some useless words and I believe it was the prophet Samuel the Bible says that none of the words which he spake fell to the ground I regret to inform you that many of my words have fallen to the ground and some of them produced rotten [Music] fruit by the grace of God because of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ I do not have to face that again if I have repented of those things which I have spouted out and so as time time goes along and God really reveals himself to us and he reveals has been revealing to us the importance of the words that come out of our mouth that we want the words that come out of our mouth to be as the words of the Lord Jesus Christ that when they come out they don't come out to be useless words they come out to be to create something to bring forth a seed of destiny that will go into the ground and come uh come up out of the ground and will bear fruit uh that will be useful and beneficial to the body of Christ we want our words when we speak them that they would bring strength and encouragement to one another that they would bring help to our brother to our sister we don't want to be found speaking words of foolish jesting that all that all the time we're just speaking things that are nonsense we want to speak life into one another life God gave us the ability to speak life and we want to speak life to one another yes amen so the words that uh God speaks will not be void they won't be without producing an effect they won't be useless now we know that again we're we're stepping on some of the territory that brother shelle preached on a few weeks or so ago just at least you know I was paying attention Genesis 1:2 it says the Earth was without form and void Darkness was upon the face of the deep the spirit of God was moving he uh he moved upon the face of the waters Genesis 1 two so the this this here's this word void that we have uh the word of God is not going to return void but we see this word void and in this case it means an empty waste we know that that is not the way God creates he creates with purpose the words that come out of his mouth are going to create something that is going to be of use it's going to be of effect to help those that it it touches but here it says the Earth was without form and void it was an empty waste and so the the spirit of God was brooding and hovering over the face of the deep all of the seed was underneath of the water mud muck water Darkness right but yet as an eagle I chose to use an eagle rather than a chicken as an eagle would sit on her eggs and brood over her eggs bringing warmth or atmosphere to those eggs while those little chickies were growing those little eaglets were growing inside of that egg until it was time for them to come out of the egg Till There Was time for the egg to hatch the seed had already been put in place and there was had to be an atmosphere the seed had already been spoken into existence and brother brandham told us in the for seal that perhaps there was another another civilization that was there and that seed was already in the earth and so uh this God will whatever the chaotic happening that took place there there is now all of this seed that is in the earth that God is brooding over under the under the water in the darkness but God is protecting that seed because the seed that was under that water was not junk seed as brother Shel has been telling us that was certified seed because it came from the mouth of God and so as God is brooding over this seed and we see in the Book of Genesis that day one he said let there be light and there was light and then day two there was a dividing of the water below from the water above the firmament the heavens and then God is in a process of bringing this seed forth and so there's some things that had to be moved there are some things that had to be shifted it did not happen all in one day just think about how long brother brandham had an argument with people that wanted to they wanted to argue that the Earth was only six days or it only took six days and that's all the older you know were 6,000 years but he seemed to think that it could be millions or even billions of years old God doesn't operate on time right I don't think we should in camp meeting either except for to get here on time millions and billions of years perhaps I don't know how long that God was brooding over this seed protecting this seed while it was under the water but there came a time where God says it's time to bring forth of the seed and the first thing he did was he spoke light into this existence because it was necessary for the light to already be in place for that seed to begin to come forth and then he divided the waters the waters below the waters above the firmament and then on day three he the let the dry land appear yes Earth and let the Earth bring forth from the seed that was already in it and so that seed began to come forth that's right because it was good seed it was seed that had been planted there from time past we read in Luke 11 verse yeah Luke 8 verse 11 now the parable is this the seed is the word of God now the seed that was underneath all of that muck was the word of God and it had to come forth it was not going to return to him as nothingness if you would have had the ability to watch what was going on at that moment you would have thought it's all over right right this will never produce anything again chaos nothing Blackness Darkness mud water this seed can never bring forth yet God was watching over that seed because he was going to bring it to pass now we read in Hebrews chap 4:2 in the Amplified the word of God that speaks is alive and full of power making it active operative energizing and effective I you you can read the rest of the verse later but I I just want you to catch those words that the Amplified gives us full of power making it active operative energizing and effective amen a word from God is never going to come back to him useless or ineffective never and because that I am a word from God I am not going to return to him useless and ineffective you as a word from God are not going to return to him as useless and ineffective now tonight you may be sitting here and feeling like as maybe the enemy has been at you all day and you feel useless and you feel ineffective I'm stressing that word feel because there are many times that the enemy makes us feel a certain way but it does not take away from the fact that I am a word sent from God and that I will not go back to him useless or ineffective and so when he comes to me to try to remind me or tell me that I am useless and ineffective I have the opportunity to remind him that I have a revelation that I am a word sent from God and that no matter what it looks like or feels like today it doesn't change what God's word said about me that I am still a useful vessel for the kingdom of God we have these ups and downs and then when we when we feel down the enemy wants to come at us and he wants to Badger us he wants to hit us he wants to kick us he wants to stomp us he wants to punch us but that is just what he is and it is what he does but I want to remind him tonight that heaven and earth may pass away but the word of God shall never pass away I am Eternal I am an eternal being I have stepped into the realm of time for a period of time but that is just a very short time because I am an eternal being from the mouth of the Eternal God and I am going to return to that Eternal God into a theop body for a period of time and then I'm told that I'm going to pick up a glorified body so as a human I'm tested I'm tried uh the the enemy batters me and he comes and he tries to test me but all of this is just God's way of putting me here to test me The Temptations come that's right just think for a moment what it feels like for a seed uhuh a kernel of seed whatever that seed may be and that seed may have come out of a package it may be been saved from another crop it may have been sitting to where that it could at least get some glimpse of light but it was kind of feeling you know that seed was dry but after a while it came time to plant that seed and if that seed could have feelings when somebody comes along with a hoe and Raks a ditch in the ground and plants that seed in the ground and then comes along and puts dirt back over top of that seed if that seed could have feelings it may start shouting wait a minute I don't want to be in this place this dark place and then whoever planted that seed had the essity after they covered it up with dirt to come along with a water and can and make mud what is that seed feeling like and you say this this this just seems so so crazy to even think about but I am a I was a seed I was a seed and there was a time that I was in the dirt I was I was in darkness I was wondering which way I was ever supposed to go but I was a seed word from God all right but I had to be planted yes sir I had to come into the Earth and God chose the way for me to get here the form of a womb of a sinful [Music] woman and man by the sin nature and then on top of that after I was born I was born I came to this world and I didn't have to learn how to lie I didn't have to learn how to be a bad person it just was the nature of of of the human the human race and so then I had to find my way to God or he found me is really the truth of the matter uh it's sometimes we say we found God but it wasn't really me looking for him he was looking for me because I was one of those certified seed that came out of his mouth that was not going to return void to him I wasn't going to return to him useless and ineffective no matter what mud it looked like I was in no matter how deep under the ground it looked like I had been there was life in that seed and that seed was going to come to life and it was going to bust up and out of that dirt out of that Darkness because it was all the time reaching for the light because the light was reaching for it he didn't send me here for me to try to get back to him by my own intellect he did not send me here to try to get back to him by being good enough for him it was because that the seed that he put in the Earth was that certified seed and it was going to produce what he desired for it to produce so in the course of events of my life he knew that it was going to take a trial of my faith in order for me to become useful and effective because the human nature wants the intellect the human nature wants to do it their way the human nature wants to think that they have accomplish something and did it by their own smarts but God wanted us to know you can be a smart person you can be a beautiful person you can be uh somebody that is born into a wealthy family but yet none of that will get you back to God it has to take the new birth and then after the New Birth is the trial of your faith 1 Peter 1:7 in the Amplified so that the genuiness of your faith may be tested your faith which is infinitely more precious than the perishable gold which is tested and purified by fire this this proving of your faith is intent intended to redound to your praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ the Messiah the anointed one is revealed now I wasn't smart enough to know what the word redown meant so I looked that up and it means to contribute greatly this proving of your faith is intended to contribute greatly to your praise and glory G and honor when Jesus Christ the Messiah the anointed one is revealed so all of this that you're going through the trial of your faith the proving of your faith it is intended so that when you are finished with this journey it is going to be that you have a great contribution to your praise and glory and honor when he is revealed in his fullness now in Reading I have come to understand that gold does not exist in its purest form naturally The Ore is extracted from the earth and in that ore there are contaminant and there are different ways to to get the contaminants out of the gold that's right uh and it is the way that they get it till that it gets to the highest level in my understanding 24 Karat being the purest of gold so in this mining process being mixed with impurities one of the ways that they refine this gold is to apply heat 1,948 de Fahrenheit Mighty hot I might and I heard a minister a few weeks ago talking about gold and talking about the refining process something that struck me he said you know the gold is not crying out stop the heat it's the impurities that are screaming stop the heat the gold says Crank It Up get all the impurities out the impurities are screaming whoa that's enough for right now take it's too hot and when we get in the middle of the trial we the human part of us we can hardly stand the heat of this refining process but yet there's something deep down on the inside that's crying turn it up get it as hot as it needs to be I'm tired of this refining process let's get to the Purity hallelujah hallelujah I'd like to tell you that I'm not full of impurities I'm not I am not full of impurities I've been walking with the Lord now for some years and there's some of them that have been refined out of me by the grace of God and I believe it's that way for you as well and if it's not I would like to tell you your turn's coming but I am not trying to throw anything at you that I would sit and gloat while you go through what you've got to go through to get rid of it because the reving process is not a pretty process when when it comes to humanity but it is a necessary process for us to get the impurities out of it because God is going to have me his word come back to him as useful and effective Jesus Jeremiah chapter 1 verse four the word of the Lord came to me the word of the Lord came to me saying this is Jeremiah before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before you came forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet to the Nations then I said a lord God behold I cannot speak for I am a child but the Lord said to me say not I'm a child for Thou shalt go to all that I shall send you and whatsoever I command thee Thou shalt speak be not afraid of their faces for I am with thee to deliver thee saith the Lord then the Lord put his put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the Lord said unto me behold I have put my words in your mouth see I have this day set thee over the Nations and over the kingdoms to root out to pull down to destroy to throw down to build and to plant now God gave Jeremiah quite the task he told him before you ever got here I knew you and Amplified says I approved you as my chosen servant before you ever got here by his forn knowledge he knew your choice and he could give you a prefixed Destiny before you ever came out out of the womb God knew you and he had already approved you he did not wait till the night you called on him to approve you if he ever approved you he did it way before you got here and he said Jeremiah I have put my word in your mouth now when God puts his word in your mouth then your word is now his word cuz he put it there and because he put it there and chose you to speak it then it won't return useless and ineffective it is going to accomplish what it was sent to do so then he tells him the words that I've put in your mouth are going to accomplish some things they're going to root out and they're going to pull down and they're going to destroy and they're going to overthrow now this looks bad you got to remember that when Jeremiah was prophesying this was toward the end of Israel's Kingdom when they were going to go into Babylonian captivity and they were going to be you know uh was it zedekiah there was another man that was prophesying differently than is that right that was prophesying differently than Jeremiah and he said to years Years and we're going to be back whereas Jeremiah was saying the word of the Lord is 70 years we're going to be in captivity and Jeremiah he when he hears this man saying it's only going to be two years he said okay Amen Let It Be So let it let 70 years be wrong you know two years I'll go with that but the word of the Lord was in Jeremiah's mouth and he had to contend with some things and he had to deal with some false prophets and he had to deal with the people that were going Wayward and he saw this Kingdom in Decline and his heart is hurting for it and so God is telling him I'm calling you to say some things that are not going to be pretty but you don't worry about it don't even worry about what their faces look like you just go ahead and speak what I put in your mouth I am going to put my word in your mouth and there's going to be some rooting out and there's going to be some plucking down and pulling down and destroying and overthrowing but God didn't leave it in the state of disarray there was also going to be some word that was going to build back up and planting and there was going to be things that came out of Jeremiah's mouth that was going to prophetically declare in time to come I'm going to take you into captivity and you're going to be there for 70 years but after 70 years there's going to be a rebuilding and there's going to be a planting and I'm going to bring you back to the land I'm going to let the people come back to the land and so all of these things you know Jeremiah he feels like he's too young to be the mouthpiece for God to be able to speak these things and he's arguing with the Lord and the Lord says now you hush up don't you tell me you're too young I'm going to put my word in your mouth you just speak what I put there then the word of the Lord verse 11 moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying Jeremiah what seeth thou and I said I see a rod of an almond tree then said the Lord unto me thou Hast well seen for I will hasten my word to perform it now Jeremiah is now again spoken to by the Lord and the Lord asked Jeremiah this question what do you see Jeremiah immediately had a response or so it seems here that he had a response quickly he didn't have to second guess himself he spoke back to the Lord and he said I see the rod of an almond tree then the Lord said you've seen right you've seen well I will hasten my word to perform it now these words here are very interesting to me because the word almond is the Strong's word 8247 shade and the word hasten is 8245 shocked 8245 hasten means to watch or to wake 8246 which is not in this text here is the replica of an almond not the actual almond 8247 is the actual almond and what I'm seeing here is a play on these Hebrew words that you don't see in the English you don't see in the King James uh you see it a little better in the Amplified moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying Jeremiah what do you see and I said I see a branch or a chute of an almond tree the emblem of alertness and activity blossoming in late winter then said the Lord to me you have seen well for I am alert and active watching over my word to perform it how hard is it for you to bring back Hebrews 4:12 in the Amplified can you give me back Hebrews 4:12 Amplified the word that God speaks is alive and full of power making it active operative energizing and effective here he says I am alert and active watching over my word to perform it now he has these play on these words here they're very close to one another and so then your mind begins to think almond what do you have that is almond what in the scripture is the Almond so then we go to Exodus chapter 25 and this is one of those passages of scripture that we don't have a lot of understanding about and so in our younger years we kind of drifted over it verse 31 Thou shalt make a Candlestick of pure gold of beaten work shall the Candlestick be made his shaft his branches his bowls his knops and his flowers shall be of the same and six branches shall come out of the sides of it three branches of the Candlestick out of the side the one side and three branches of the Candlestick out of the other side three bowls made like un almonds with a knop and a flower in one branch three bowls made like almonds in the other Branch with a knop and a flower so in the six branches that come out out of the Candlestick and in the Candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds with their knops and their flowers this is a lot of repetition of knops and bowls and flowers but I want to read all of it because probably most of us have skipped over it all right verse 34 in the Candlestick shall be four bowls made like almonds with their knops and their flowers and there shall be a knp under two branches of the same and a knp under two branches of the same and a knp under two branches of the same according to the six branches that prede out of the Candlestick now I want you to know that if bezel didn't have any more instruction than that thank God for the anointing getting in the spirit spirit with Moses Moses trying to give to him understanding of what he saw in another realm but bezel was the one that had to build it their knops and their branches shall be of the same it shall be of one beaten work of pure gold and thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof and they shall light the lamps thereof that they may give light over against it and the tongs thereof and the snuff dishes thereof shall be of pure gold of a Talon of pure gold shall he make it with all these vessels and look that thou make them after their pattern which was showed thee in the mountain so now in this seven Branch Candlestick God chose to incorporate this almond in the branches of this seven branched Candlestick God has incorporated the knop which in in looking at the definition some of the definitions they say a knob well that doesn't really tell you anything but what it appears that it is it's like the the encircling of of the flower and you can look online and see pictures of the manora that is is ready that they have there on display in Jerusalem but you have the Almond uh the bowl made like almond these seven bowls that are made like almonds and you begin to ponder God is using this word again shade to to speak here about this seven Branch Candlestick that is in the T Tabernacle that Moses saw when he was in the mount and he brought it back down and he spoke to bezel and he's trying to give him instructions and bezo is getting under the anointing he's getting in the spirit and he's going to build we read later on in Exodus that indeed he built it and he built it according to the instruction and it had these balls like under almonds and so you have this play on words again where God has built into this seven Branch Candlestick this thought of the Almond where he says there's alertness and watchfulness and in this alertness and watchfulness these these bowls that are shaped like almonds are holding the oil whereof the priests are going to light and and keep it burning the fire inside of the Holy place and so God is again representing himself that he is watching over his word to perform it because just a little ways away from that behind that curtain is where the high priest can only go one time a year for the sins of the people is the holy of holies where is The Mercy Seat and inside of that Mercy Seat there's some of the Mana and there is there is the showbread there and there is also Aaron's Rod God told them to put that Rod there now what's so special about Aaron's Rod well there had been a rebellion among the people and Kora he thought he he thought he was going to come and take over Moses's position and and then uh there were others there that wanted to usurp Authority they thought that Moses had taken too much upon himself and God said you separate from those people he told Moses you separate from those people and if I don't do something completely different than is normal for this Earth then then you won't have to say that I have have done this but if the Earth opens up and swallows them you will know that I have showed up and so indeed the Earth it opens up and it swallows Kora and his sons and down into the Earth all their stuff went down into the Earth God just swallowed them up but do you think that stopped the murmuring of the people no and the people come to Moses again and say Moses you take too much on yourself take too much on yourself and God said just get out of the way I'll take care of them and there was a plague that went through the camp and Moses once again became intercession for the people but before it was over there were over 14,000 people that were dead in that instance besides the ones that had died before the plague was stopped but after that God invited each head of the tribe to come to the door of the tent of meeting and he says I want every one of you to bring a rod and I want you to inscribe your name in that rod and I am going to once and for all I am going to differentiate between who I have called and who man is called I'm going to demonstrate something to you so so they were instructed to bring the rods the staff and they were to take and put them into the holy of holies and they were to leave them there overnight well when they came back to retrieve those rods there was 11 rods that look just the way they did when they put them there but there was one rod that God got in and when God got in that rod the Bible tells us that not only did it have buds but it had blooms not only did it have Buds and blooms but it also brought forth ripe almonds here we are with the Almond again God watching over his word to perform it I am going to do what I said I would do I called Aaron to be the high priest I called that lineage I called his family I called Moses and I have this seven Branch Candlestick with this demonstration of the Almond W with with this almond look alike here this dish on top that produces light but I'm going to shed more light than just the seven Branch Candlestick when it gets in the presence of the Shea it's going to bring forth what I instituted for it to bring forth to start with Hallelujah now I've never been privileged to be in Israel when the almond trees bloom but I am told that it is more beautiful than Washington DC when the cherry trees bloom the thing about when you read about the Almond what you find is that it is the first blooming tree it's the first one to bloom seemingly while it is still winter it blooms the first one to bloom but the interesting thing is it's last to harvest first to bloom last to harvest we get in a hurry because we want it now when a word comes forth to us we want it now sometimes we feel like we need it right now I need this word to be fulfilled right now I don't need it in 30 years I need it now but my my papa who is watching over his word to perform it knows best now we have demonstrated in the scripture what God showed to Jeremiah in this Rod this he said I see an almond tree to the Natural Eye all that the rod that air carried around was just another stick cut off from its Life Source something to keep Aaron steady on his feet now there was a lot more to that Rod than just keeping Aaron steady on his feet this was a rod that God used multiple times but it still looked like a dead dry stick until it got in the presence the shenar now you have this seven Branch Candlestick on the outside with the semblance of almonds in the bowls and then you have the curtain dividing the holy of holies I oh God doesn't do things just to dangle before our eyes and say this is what I did yesterday and so I began to think about this and I remembered that there was a time that John was caught up in the spirit on the Lord's Day Revelation chap 1:10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice as a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest right in a book incend it under the seven churches which are in Asia under Ephesus and Smyrna under pergamus and under thyra and unto Sardis and unto Philadelphia and unto lead deia and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and I being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks now if Moses was caught up and he was instructed to come back to the Earth and build what he saw when he was on the mountain I believe that he was caught up into Heavenly places and he saw what John was seeing and he brought it back down to the Earth so somewhere in this seven golden candlesticks I believe that there is a semblance of an almond somewhere so now he says I turned and I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like un the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire I will watch over my word to perform it I will watch over my word to perform it the eyes of the Lord going to and fro throughout the whole earth he's going to bring to fruition the word that came out of his mouth and he John is now seeing in this heavenly places he is seeing wandering through these seven gold are in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks the one like the son of man and he's talking about what he looks like but he says his eyes were like flames of fire and we have heard that this eyes of flames of fire was his love for his bride he's watching over his word to perform it his head and his hair is white like wool as white as snow his eyes flames of fire and his feet like undefined brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death glory god walking through the midst of the seven churches the demonstration that the eyes of the Lord are upon us the demonstration that the word that goes out of his mouth he is going to have his eyes on that and he is going to make sure that that word comes to its fullness that it comes to its full Effectiveness its full usefulness he is going to make sure that you do not linger too long outside of the holy of holies but he wants you to go in behind the holy of holies where that it's not just the representation in the bowl where there is light but there has come come light in the evening time to shed light upon the fact that you don't have to remain in the Holy place but you've been invited to come into the holy of holies behind the veil to shut out the world and to enter into the presence of God where that something happens where he can take an old Dead stick and it's no longer just the representation or the lookalike in an alond but it is the very life of Jesus Jesus Christ poured into the believer so that she becomes useful and she becomes effective in the earth and by the time that she gets to the end of her life she has found her place her position Hallelujah just as Aaron's Rod was no longer a dead dry stick but God in His Infinite Wisdom came with his presence and his power and breathed life back into that stick and that stick just didn't come forth just a little bit with just a bud it didn't stop in the middle part with a blossom but the Bible tells us that it came forth with ripe almonds it came forth with something of substance something that showed I have put my life in this and it has produce the fruit that it was designed to produce you are not a dead dry [Music] stick you are a word sent from God and I want you to know that even as God spoke to Jeremiah and said I have put my word in your mouth Jeremiah that God has also done that for his bride in the end time and he said I've put my word in your mouth and we had a prophet that came in our dead in our day and he told us that the word in the mouth of the Bride that she would have power to be able to create a world and go live on it she would have power to stop the heavens she would have power to call forth frogs she would have power to do this and do that because the word of God was in her mouth yet we have found ourselves saying where is this and God speaks back what do you see what do you see good what do you see good word what have you talked about about your own self just a dead dry stick I'm useless in in this church I'm useful useless in the Kingdom there's nothing for me to do nobody pays attention to me what do you see yeah or when the Lord asks you what do you see you respond with I see that I am a word sent from God and that because you chose to demonst rate that word through a human vessel I could not be let loose with all that you wanted me to be from day one so I had to go through that fiery trial process to be able to get me refined to the point where that I could be trusted to have the word of God in my mouth because the word that God speaks is effective it come on right and I want you to know that when God speaks a word even if it's a cutting word it is effective word and when it was a word through the prophet to bring a kingdom down it was an effective word that is why we have to go through the refining process so the word that he puts in our mouth is not our own word word but we speak what he says to speak we hear from heaven we only we wait until that we have a word from the Lord to speak and then we speak it because his words are effective words they're useful words they're active they're operative they go and they cut down on the inside and they do things and if they're operated with an improper V in an improper way they can do great damage and we're too far up the road sir for there to be damage done with a real true word of God that is operated by an unclean vessel so we've got to know that we're speaking it with a clean vessel out of a pure heart that we know God not just across this Pulpit folks but we've got to know as uh and communicating to one another that we are speaking words of life amen they may look cutting on the surface but if they're a word from God they're going to be useful they're going to be energizing they're going to be effective they're going to be operative they're going to be words that are going to cause us to become alert they're going to be words that are going to cause us to say hey I recognize that I've gotten out of the I've gotten out of the way just a little bit I need to get right I got to get right back in the middle Get Right Back in Balance want you to stand with me all over the house tonight what do you see jermiah I see a rod of an almond tree you have seen well I will hasten my word I am alert dirt and I am active I am like that almond tree that blooms when it still feels like it's winter outside I am alert and I am active and I am ready at all times to watch over that word that I have already given to make sure that it comes to its fruit it may take a while to get to the fruit it's the first to bloom the last to harvest I don't know what that looks like for you but I know that there are things that a lot of us have been contending for through the years we've been contending for them glory glory glory and sometimes we contended with murmurings and sometimes we contended with faith yes but I just come tonight to tell you that the Holy Ghost he is he is alert and he is operative Hallelujah and he has not only stayed in a place where he is above us and he is not only where he is with us but he has come to dwell inside of us he was not content to be as an almond looking bowl looking on right saying everything's good I'm watching over my word to perform it he came in the form of of a human being took on the nature of this human flesh and he walked Among Us god with us but he knew that that wasn't going to work as one individual to get the rest of us to get to maturity it was going to take God in us it was going to be of necessity that he go away he was one that came to demonstrate that although he was tempted in every way as we are yet without sin he demonstrated it and then he went back to his original place of power and authority and he sent back his Spirit on the elect lady he sent back his spirit and he said I don't want to just be God above you I don't want to be God beside of you but I want to be God inside of you I want to Tabernacle with you now can you imagine during the Feast of Tabernacles when Jesus was walking through the city of Jerusalem on his last trip to Jerusalem for his the Feast of Tabernacles as a human being because the following year he would be crucified can you imagine as he is disrupting all of that going on he is he is there he's watching over his word to perform it but now he's demonstrated as God With Us and he's showing I am here and and that pool of silom that ritual that they did Where They Carried that water picture and all of a sudden God disrupts their party and he says if any man thirst let him come and drink of the water that I have he just disrupts him and all over the city there are these tall candal abas you know one in the temple wasn't enough they had to put some more up because Herod wanted to demonstrate that he could build big so they had these candle laas all over the city to light the women's G and and so the next day after he ruins their pool of salom ritual then he's preaching in their synagogue and he's disrupting the Pharisees and the Sadducees and he you know he's speaking to the woman that was of ill Fame and and they want a stoner and he disrupts that party and he says the first one among you cast a stone right now they're all proud of these lights that are in the city and then he says I am the light of the world and then he comes along and he says you are the light amen you are the light see he's watching over his word to perform it because he doesn't want to just be God above us he doesn't want to just be God With Us doing all the work he wants to be God in us fully mature sons that are operating in what they've been called to do from from the time of seed to the time of harvest he wants them fully operational in what they've been called to [Music] do and we're here this week to allow him to do more of his work in us we're here to get rid of our murmurings our complainings we're here to say Lord I can't be satisfied in this outer court and I can't be satisfied in the Holy place I've got to get in behind that holy of holies I've got to get where the real true presence of God is and I want to be changed so magnificently Hallelujah till that his Aon rud Aaron's Rod budded it bloomed and brought forth fruit that's what I'm longing for is there anybody in this house that has the same longing as I have you long to come to the fruit of the spirit that you have been destined for you long to bring forth fruit that is inside of you it's there friends if you are certified seed the fruit is potentially already there but we have done all kinds of things to stunt the growth right we're going to allow the Holy Ghost when as we go behind the holy of holies we're allowing the Holy Ghost to prune we're allowing the Holy Ghost to to dig around the roots we're allowing him to bring some some some real nutritious water to us this week to bring about in us the Necessities that we have need of because he is here watching over his word to perform it because it will not return to him useless and

your word word we'll look to your word we'll say what your word says there's even a multiplication in it because Moses saw one seven branched Candlestick when he stood in Heavenly places he saw one seven branch Candlestick one message one word through a prophet but when John went into the same place before the throne there were now seven candlesticks with seven branches symbolizing a word a message that you would send into seven Church ages there were seven spirits seven lamps before your throne there were seven divisions of your word that would now go forth into the Earth in their alloted and appointed times and John not only saw the seven seven Branch candlesticks the holy manora but he saw you in the midst of them and the Greek tells us that you weren't just walking among them but you showed yourself to John as the middle as the middle Candlestick you were the servant you were father we thank you that you were the one from which all other branches receive their oil and receive their light hallelujah hallelujah may we be an extension of your word for this hour blessed be the Lord sing that again and let's worship for another moment before we go sing it man Lord

Heavenly Host that's been assigned to you but be aware I I hear the Lord saying some of you will hear them Whispering as they communicate with one another and you will know that I have surrounded you

you I worship I hear the Lord saying that that some of you will become aware of my heavenly host going before you as they break open the atmosphere around you like plow shares I will send my heavenly host before you to prepare the way sayeth the Lord to cut through the atmosphere of darkness and negativity and some of you will be aware that my heavenly host are coming behind you to guard you in your most vulnerable place sayeth the Lord and some of you will be aware that I have encompassed you and surrounded you even as the mountains surround my city sayeth the Lord you will know that I have

brought you through this place of loneliness for a reason and for a purpose don't despise this season of feeling alone you're you're never alone the Lord would remind you tonight that you are never alone you are always surrounded by his presence and by the angels that have been assigned to your life the Lord said don't despise this season some of you have been in where you feel like I wish I just had a friend I wish I just had a friend my age with my interest with my likes with my with my that I could just gel with and connect with and and flow with the Lord said I had to I had to transform you first I had to bring about a transformation first before I could connect [Music] you and I hear the Lord saying that as we move into the next season you will see bone finding [Music] bone the Lord said open your heart because there are others of likeminded who are of the same tribe open your heart and be ready to welcome them for I am Gathering My Tribe together in this hour anybody want to praise the Lord does anybody want to receive the when when the Lord Speaks Over us the way to receive it just say amen amen amen so be it amen amen when the Priestly blessing is given over the Jewish people during the time of seot at the cotel they're answering by amen amen amen so be it Lord so be it Lord I I I'm hearing one other thing and I I heard it coming from a long way away I I I couldn't quite make it out yet for for a while but I heard it coming from from a from a far away in in the realm of the spirit and I hear the Lord saying that some of you have fallen into a trap of speaking out of both sides of your mouth because your mind has been doubled I hear the Lord saying you've tried to operate with two minds and I remind you that a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways and because you've had two minds and two thought processes that are entirely opposite of one another it has caused you to speak one thing to the left and another thing to the right and the Lord said that season is coming to an end and if you don't let it end in your life it's going to cost you something the Lord is letting me know that the choice is ours and we are going going to have to choose to have one mind and we're going to have to choose not speak to the right or the left but straight ahead and it must be in line with his word if you're not willing to make that choice it's going to be major adjustments if you agree there will be major adjustments some of you may even have to go back and correct lies eyes it will be a huge adjustment but the Lord said if you refuse to come into agreement with him and have one mind and speak one word of clarity it'll cost you it's going to cost you something so tonight Lord we say we are willing we are willing you better take this serious somebody Lord we're willing we recognize that there are times that our mind has been double we have thought the thoughts of Christ and his word and we have thought the thoughts of Flesh and carnality and because of that we confess before the Lord that it has caused us to speak one way to the left and another to the right but tonight we ask for your Divine forgiveness and we ask that you break off of us whatever the enemy has tried to robe us with that would cause us to speak confusion and tainted words and even lies and we repent of that this evening before you Lord and we ask you for clarity of your thoughts and the grace to choose to speak accordingly I worship you Lord Lord I worship [Music] you I worship [Music] you Lord I worship you Jesus Jesus I worship you you oh
