TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit [Music] but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right I Christ in you the hope a lord [Music] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of New Hope revival ministries and we're coming to you today in partnership with our wonderful friends at the gospel channel we pray that this program will be a blessing to you in some way my desire is that it would inspire you to look at God's Word maybe in a different way than you've ever looked at it before it's more than just a book of instructions or a book of Commandments thank God for His instructions thank God for His commandments we love them the Bible tells us that we should love the laws of the Lord and love His commandments but it's also a love story and it's also a word that reveals to us a relationship that's available in this end time that we're living in one by which we can draw close to the Lord and know him in a personal way I'm thankful for the gospel Channel I'm thankful for the programming I believe that God is using the network to win the lost I believe the discouraged are being discouraged I believe that the prayer of faith is bringing healing to those who are sick and by the way it would be a great great blessing to us to be able to stand with you in prayer for your prayer requests if you will send them in you can email them there is a phone number that you can call and leave your prayer requests or you can send by old-fashioned snail mail a request and we will be more than happy to stand with you in prayer we have a wonderful group of prayer warriors here at our church who would just love to believe God with you for your need and we also like to hear when God is moving and answering prayer and testimonies of the goodness of God in your life we desire to be connected with you we appreciate hearing from where you're watching this program we've been studying now for some time the Word of God we've been looking at different aspects of the Word of God and recently when we were together we began to talk about entering into a place of rest we were reading in Hebrews chapter 3 and chapter 4 where the Apostle was comparing the journeyings of the children of Israel our forefathers as they're called in Hebrews those who went before us and how their struggle with unbelief is what kept them basically from inheriting the promised land as a generation we know that many of those older ones died in the wilderness and God raised up another generation that was actually strong enough and able and ready to go in and deal with the inhabitants of the land so that indeed the children of God could possess their inheritance and this is a New Testament scripture Hebrews three and four and these chapters I believe say a lot to us about what our approach toward the Word of God should be in this hour and I just like to review just a moment because I want to go a little further in the time that we have together today we were reading initially Hebrews chapter 4 verse 11 and 12 and I'm just going to read verse 11 right now let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief and then of course the next verse is verse 12 that very powerful verse that describes the Word of God as a weapon as a tool it talks about the ability of the Word of God to discern even the secret thought and the tenth of the heart you know one of the things that we are warned against in New Testament scripture is judging someone's motives trying to read their heart and maybe perceive why they do what they do and then passing judgment on their motive the Bible tells us clearly that this is not our place we may think we know why someone does what they do we may think that we have some special insight about what's going on in someone else's heart but the reality is only the Word of God possesses that ability-- both I believe the written word of God can do it because when we read it and we begin to digest it I was going to say discern it but absolutely when we begin to allow the Spirit of God to break it down for us in our life then I think we can sometimes see our motive but it's only by the Word of God that the motive of the heart is revealed and that's on an individual basis so we really need to leave the work of the word to the word and we need to pray for one another and love one another and serve one another you know there are many people on the same journey that you and I our own and that is to press in to Christ in this day and in this hour and it's not an easy thing because there are many distractions and I tell you the enemy gets wild when he sees the children of God really pursuing a close walk with the Lord when when the enemy sees you and I pressing past our circumstances and into Christ with a real relationship an unshakable relationship with him well the enemy he just starts pulling out his bag of tricks and distractions and attacks and lies and he uses anything and everything that he can to discourage you to dissuade you from your relationship with the Lord but I tell you it's worth pressing into and we have authority over the enemy when we begin to discern and recognize that the enemy is lying to us that he's trying to move us off the truth of God's Word then we have we have some ammunition to use against him we think about the temptation of our Lord who was moved by the spirit after a long fast into the wilderness and there Satan appeared to tempt him and what was the answer that Jesus gave consistently to the temptations of the enemy it is written so we know that if our Lord used the word of god even quoting the written word of god has a weapon against the enemy then you and I can follow his example and I've actually used the word of God in my own life at times to put the devil on the run it's not just afraid of words but when he realizes that you believe what you say when he realizes that your faith is attached to the Word of God that you're quoting that scatters the enemy so we we talked about how we're being warned by the Apostle here to make sure that we don't allow unbelief to bring about the same kind of fall or failure in our lives that we observed in the lives of the children of Israel and then as we were winding up our time together we moved a one chapter back to Hebrews chapter three and we read verses 8 through 14 let me do that I believe I can do it real quick here because I want to make sure that we know where we've been so we can get an idea of where we're going it says in verse eight harden not your heart your hearts I believe that's good advice we need to keep our spiritual man soft our hearts need to be soft before the Lord trials and heartache grief and losses can certainly cause emotionally our hearts to be hard but God is looking for hearts that are moldable and pliable that he can speak truth in truth that will not just comfort us but truth that will transform us into the image of Jesus Christ he goes on to talk about the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness and we mentioned that the complete Jewish Bible refers to that as the bitter quarrel when your father's tempted me proved me and saw my works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always err in their heart and they have not known my ways so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest verse 12 take heed brethren and I encourage you to do this exactly what's being asked of us I'm going to do it take heed brethren lest there be any of you or in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin which is unbelief for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end there is something to be said about being consistent about being stedfast when we come to know the Lord that is our testimony our profession of faith but sometimes along the way our testimony gets weaker and weaker and compromise seems to take ahold of our lives let me just encourage you Body of Christ this is no time to slack up this is no time to compromise in fact this is time to dig deeper into God and into the things of God this is the hour to open up more of your life to the leadership and to the authority of the Holy Spirit so that God by the Spirit can place his finger on things in our lives that need to be extracted so when we keep maybe sealing off certain areas of our life not allowing the Spirit of God to have open and free access to those areas of our life then we we can only grow so much we can only experience a certain measure of change and transformation but I believe that because of the new birth we have the potential of being changed from glory to glory even as we have talked about it levels of glory dimensions of glory we have talked about that more than one time when we have met together in this same way so it's not a time to get slack it's not a time to compromise we are actually receiving an invitation to be strengthened by the Word of God in this our fortified what we can do is get behind that word we have a hiding place in the truth of God's Word it becomes our fortress it becomes our strong tower and it certainly becomes a place of refuge when the enemy is howling I like this verse and I put it in my notes to share with you also 1st corinthians chapter 15 and verse 58 says therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord you and I can be rock steady in an hour where everything around us is shifting and sinking like like the sinking sand in the amplified it says therefore my beloved brethren be firm be steadfast immovable always abounding in the work of the Lord always being superior excelling doing more than enough in the service of the Lord knowing and being continually aware that your labor in the Lord is not futile it is not it is never wasted or to no purpose there's always reward and there's always purpose for what we do in the kingdom of God even if in our own eyes it seems so miniscule so small and insignificant if you are hearing the voice of the Lord and you're being obedient to it in any way I'm telling you your labor for the Lord is not in vain even if it's just a prompting of the Spirit pray for new hope revival ministries pray for the gospel channel pray for mrs. Smith who lives on the corner of your street and you think well I don't even really know mrs. Smith but when we get those leadings of the Spirit of the Lord we must be obedient we must move immediately into prayer because if God puts it on your heart it's because there is a need we may not know the full impact of our obedience especially some of those small obediences until we stand in the presence of God but I believe there's in a day when we will know every everything that we need to know all those things that we didn't understand you know I've had the Spirit of the Lord give me well let me say respectfully strange instructions sometimes instructions that could have been embarrassing even but if we can learn to be obedient in those things I do believe the scripture is clear there is a great reward coming I believe it is critical that we are rock solid right now I believe that it is very important that we walk before God in balance what we have sometimes referred to as the middle of the road did you know that you can take even truth something as precious as truth and you can take it so far out past its biblical parameter until you make a religion out of it and when you make a religion out of something that is truth you kill it you take its life from it the Bible said the letter killeth but the spirit make it alive when when we try to impose the Word of God on someone without offering them the life and the grace of God to be able to live that then we're actually introducing religion to them instead of imparting life to them and that is not ministry ministry is to reach out with the life of Jesus Christ not in word only but also indeed I believe that Christ has everything for us that we need everything we need to overcome everything we need to walk before him in a victorious life I believe the keys to those things that we need are found in the Word of God and when we pursue them in the written word we're giving an opportunity for the Living Word to stand up in us and begin to bring these things to pass in our lives this is what I think is so important about allowing the Holy Spirit to reveal truth to us is you know sometimes truth can can feel so far away so unattainable but with the Spirit of God quickens it to you you realize that you're not attaining you're not you're not all you're doing is laying a hold of something to the best of your strength and ability but it's the Spirit of God that's taking the hold of you and it becomes the responsibility of God to bring his word to pass in your life when you're doing your part and our part is to to discover what this is labor what labor are we to do so that we can enter in to the rest that we read about in Hebrews chapter four in the same manner that Israel did not enter Canaan they didn't enter into the fullness of the promise of God not as a generation it was the generation after and why was that it was due to unbelief there are many Christians who will not experience all that Christ has for them in this hour in their lives and for the same cause unbelief so at the base of it all we've got to make sure that the issue of unbelief is forever settled in our life the Bible tells us right there in Hebrews 3:19 so we see they could not enter in why because of unbelief verse 12 began by telling us the reason that we must labor to enter into rest and remove the threat of unbelief from stopping us the way that we do that is by recognizing the Word of God as our weapon not just against the devil but the Word of God is also our weapon against unbelief it truly is the more we read who God is not just what he's done but who he is and allow the Spirit of the Lord to make that personal and I think I a couple times a goal and we met together this way I I was just giving some simple instruction about how to pray the word you just take the promises of God as you read them and begin to pray them father I read in your word that it is your desire to give me your kingdom it is your desire to work the works of righteousness in me and through me and I'm having a hard time Lord figuring out how this is would you allow your word to be quickened in me right now so that I might begin to flow in understanding so that I might know where to attach my faith and how I might begin to move forward in actually seeing the fulfillment of this word in my life as an individual I think sometimes we spend a lot of time disqualifying ourselves when the Spirit of God is trying to qualify us it is by grace it's by grace that we are saved it is not of works lest any man should boast and maybe we have to be reminded of that over and over and over again all what a price he has paid if you're watching this program right now and you are still under the heavy burden of sin unbelief still rules in your life and you have never fully committed yourself to Jesus Christ maybe you've never prayed a simple sinner's prayer Lord come into my heart I believe that Jesus is the Son of God the Word of God made flesh and that his blood is ever sufficient to not only cover my sin but to remit them as though they were never committed in the first place if you've never prayed a prayer of simple faith like that I encourage you to do that even now invite him to come in to break the chain and the hold of sin and unbelief over your life and to allow the life of Jesus Christ to begin to operate in your spirit and in your soul this is what is available it it is available to you those of you who have never experienced it you have very little to lose and everything to gain by just simply giving faith a try if you can believe if you can believe that Jesus is the Son of God shed his blood to redeem you raised again on the third day and now stands as an intercessor and a mediator for your life if you can only believe that if you can only fellowship that with your faith and trust that God will sort out the rest then your new birth can begin even now your new life can begin even now as you invite Jesus to come in now in Hebrews chapter four verse one we were reading in verse eleven and twelve but in verse one it says let us therefore fear I find another paradox here you know it's a paradox when the Bible says let us therefore labor to enter into rest it's also a paradox for me when the scripture says let us therefore fear because if I know anything about the Bible I can tell you over and over and over again it says do not be afraid be thou not afraid don't be afraid don't fear fear not because these are the instructions of even the Lord Jesus Christ don't be afraid don't fear but here the Apostle is telling us to fear to be afraid so there must be another kind of fear the Bible tells us that fear brings torment and that perfect love casteth out fear but the scripture says here let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it the Amplified Bible says it this way therefore while the promise of entering his rest still holds and is offered today let us be afraid to distrust it let any of you lest any of you should think he has come too late and has come short of reaching it so we're to be very concerned very very concerned that we don't allow unbelief to keep us from entering in to the promise of rest the new American Standard says therefore let us fear if while a promise remains of entering his rest any one of you may seem to have come short of it and the complete Jewish Bible says therefore let us be terrified of the possibility that even though the promise of entering his rest remains any of you might be judged to have fallen short of it this is clear in almost all of these translations that we have a promise of rest it remains it is intact it has not expired the Lord is inviting you and I to come out of the land of struggle to come out of that mental anguish that we can easily find ourselves in and come into a place of trust a place of confidence a place of dependency and I believe the Apostle is telling us here there's only one thing that would keep us out of the promise of rest and that is unbelief so what must we do we must deal with our unbelief in in verse 2 of Hebrews 4 King James says for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them here's the key very very important key I hope you will catch it with me for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it now this is serious business to me because all of them that whole generation that was led out by the supernatural hand of God in the exodus out of slavery years of oppression years of slavery with no freedom to serve God and live for God the way that they desired to do so fully under this oppression and now God supernaturally raises up a leader and brings them out and into the wilderness and the promise of the Promised Land was to every one of them every one of them had the promise that they could enter into the land of promise but for some of them the promise was not a reality and the reason is they fell short of it as the Apostle said they fell short of it and what was the requirement that they missed it was labor they did not labor to enter into the rest now what was the labor well here it tells us the labor oh my the work the effort that was the exertion all of these words that we used when looking at these verses of scripture every bit of that was simply adding their faith to the word that was being preached to them they sat under Moses the great prophet of God and he was giving them the mind of God revealing to them the desires of God his desire was to have a relationship with them as a people as a group as a nation we remember that on Mount Sinai when that covenant was cut and we sometimes refer to that as a Catawba because this is the Hebrew word for for the marriage covenant and here God was giving Israel as a people a marriage contract it was the Torah it was the books of instruction it was the law of God and in that was God promising what he would give what he would do what his part of the contract or covenant would be and also what he would require of the other party the nation of Israel and many heard it and they said mm hmm hmm they nodded their head some said a man some said praise the Lord you know like we do in church uh-huh that's right sometimes I tell the folks at our church could you nod your head a little louder because you're getting very very quiet and I realize that that's not always a sign of whether someone is hearing or applying the word that they hear but God wasn't just asking for an amen out of the Israeli people or the the nation of Israel he was asking for them to labor and the labor was not in the keeping of the Covenant all of the laws this was part of the love contract I totally understand that but where they missed it was not in that because listen God asks something from them and then he provided a system of offerings and sacrifices to cover them when they failed I mean God was really setting something up beautifully yes he wanted righteousness yes he wanted the people to live above unbelief and above sin but he knew that they would not all be able to measure up to the mark and so what did he do he outlined for them by the prophet Moses very very carefully very specifically for this sin for this a transgression of the law you'll bring this this animal and it will be treated this way and this is how the priests will handle it and so forth and so God was requiring something of them but then he was providing the offering providing the instruction that was needed to make everything all right and all God seemed to be asking of them was that they believed that they overcome that enemy of unbelief and that they mix their faith with the word when I when I hear that expression what I get is you know maybe it's easier to have faith for someone else but this is not one of those situations where that's going to work I've got faith for someone else for instance have you ever had a a malady or an infirmity in your body you've prayed and prayed and you have tried to stand on God's promise for your own healing and then someone you loved or cared about a church friend a family member had also some infirmities some sickness and all of a sudden your faith would just rise up for that person and you would stand on the promise of God for them and my you would even see in many cases you've even seen the miracle you've seen the Lord perform it was easier somehow maybe seems to have faith for someone else than to have faith for yourself and this is kind of what the Apostle Paul is talking about in Hebrews three and four you can't just have faith that the promises of God are yes a man for someone else if you do then unbelief will keep you from entering into the fullness of what Christ has made available for you and I in this hour to be partakers of him means that we receive the benefit of being a part of him of being connected to him participating with him in the plan of redemption and the enemy doesn't want that he doesn't want that he wants you and I wavering in unbelief the the enemy is actually less challenged by your faith for someone else he is more challenged by what faith you have for your own life to believe that these promises of God are for you let me read it just a little bit more in the amplified verse 2 now we're talking about the explanation why did unbelief keep them out why did the word not perhaps why it was not fully effective in their life why did it not profit them and the answer was not being mixed with faith in them that heard it amplified version says for indeed we have the glad tidings the gospel of God proclaimed to us just as truly as they the Israelites of old did when the good news of deliverance from bondage came to them but the message they heard did not benefit them because it was not mixed with faith with the leaning oh my here is an explanation of this faith with the leaning of the entire personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in his power wisdom and goodness can I read that again it really says something to me because it was not mixed with faith and then here in parentheses the amplified says with the leaning of the entire personality everything stephen shelley is everything i am i love the way it's worded with my entire personality everything that makes me up i've got to lean with all of that on the promise of God in order to see it come to pass in my life with the leaning of the entire personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in his power that's not just saying well I believe God III I think God is able I believe he could if he wanted to that's not what we're talking about he said he wanted to his word obligates him he's already said he wanted to heal he's already said he wants to deliver hallelujah he's already said that he wants to set the captives free we're still trying to discover the will of God that's been made clear to us by the Word of God the will of God is revealed by the word of God this is how we know what his will and what his desire toward us is and so we're called to lean I must say it again to lean with our entire personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in his power his wisdom and his goodness let me ask you do you have absolute confidence in God's power do you have absolute confidence in God's wisdom do you have absolute confidence in God's goodness if you do then you're leaning with your whole personality everything you are on the promise of God and you're believing that it's not just for the neighbor it's for you this promise is for you and your obligation is small really and that is to take your faith well I don't have much faith the Bible says well the Bible gives us four the definition of faith faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen and then the Bible tells us that we are given the measure of faith so you and I possess the faith that is needed to take God at His Word and when we hear the word of God you know I just I'd like to advise you just practice this maybe you're alone in your home right now and here's a good opportunity for you to practice mixing your faith with the word if I say something in the remainder of this program that you truly believe is the Word of God then I want you to mix your faith with it and say that's mine that is my promise Lord you didn't just make that to Israel you didn't just make that to the Apostles or the early church you didn't just make those two your what some people might think you're you're frozen Chosin or your or your favorite view over here but you've made that promise to me and I'm going to attach my faith to it and confess that every promise in your word is mine and I'm going to stand on it when the enemy comes with the contrary a report or testimony when the doctor says this and yet the Word of God says something else I'm gonna respect the doctor but I'm gonna stand on God's Word I'm going to mix join my faith with God's Word and I'm going to hold on it kills unbelief your faith attached to God's Word kills unbelief it drives it right out of your life and why is getting rid of unbelief so important because unbelief can keep you out of rest it's like what we sometimes call a hamster wheel or a gerbil wheel you know these little pets that people sometimes have in their own I have to be honest I've never quite figured this out I'm not really sure why even though my children had two of these little creatures for a while I never could quite get myself attached to them because they reminded me too much of of some other things that you want to get rid of but here you welcome these little creatures into your house and you put them in the in the aquarium type thing I guess fish go in an aquarium but but a cage well I tell you you better make it a good one because they'll know their way right out that's for sure but then you put one of those little exercisers in there those wheels like a ferris wheel or something and though I started to say the little rat forgive me but you know what I mean that little creature gets on there and he starts running around running running running running well after a while that thing goes around so many times it starts getting a little bit tight and squeaky and that's when the I'm ready for the pets to go then because I well yes you can get a new wheel but they're just going to run that one into the same condition they just run run run run run run run run and that thing starts squeaking and squeaking and they're not going anywhere and many times that's how we are in our Christian race we're on the gerbil wheel just running running running not going anywhere at all and the Lord is inviting us to have something more than a rat race the Lord is inviting us to have something more than just Christianity light he wants us to understand what it means to be filled with the very life of God and to enter into that place of rest where the works the good works that we do we do them out of love we do them because we want to serve Him not because we want to earn his favor it's only a gerbil wheel when we have this mindset that I have to do this so that he will love me I to do this so that he will accept me I have to do this so that I can find favor with God I'm telling you nothing could be further from the truth of the Bible then my works the power of my works you you really think that I could do something good enough or wonderful enough that it would it would cause God to love me more than he already loves me I don't think so I think that we have done that with religion we talked about it recently how we've complicated New Testament Christianity I believe in good works I believe that according to the scripture faith is demonstrated with good works and that's the right order the right order is we're not doing good so that we can find favor with God and so that he will love us and accept us but in fact we're doing good works because we know that He loves us because we know that he has accepted us because we know that we have found favor in his sight our hearts are so filled with gratitude and Thanksgiving that all we want to do is please him all we want to say is things that would please the Lord and advance his kingdom do you understand how easy it is then to get the cart in front of the horse I've got to do do do-do-do so that I can be loved of the father and I'm telling you folk that that's really unbelief because it's not the word we're not believing the word when we believe a system like that and so that will keep us out of a place of rest when I'm talking about spiritual rest I mean confidence and trust that I'm covered by the blood he loves me he has chosen me he wants to be a part of my life in fact he wants to be my life he wants to be the center of my life and why wouldn't I want him b-because the more i allow him to be lord over my life i'm telling you the greater it gets the greater the relationship grows and yes we begin to see faith accomplishing great things in our hearts as individuals the complete Jewish Bible said for good news has also been proclaimed to us just as it was to them but the message they heard didn't do them any good because those who heard it did not combine it with trust that's what we're trying to say sometimes I use the expression fellowship the word and that's because I know you can't fellowship a book but you can fellowship the person that's revealed by this holy book and to fellowship him means to stay connected to stay connected much more than the occasional text to understand what I mean but I don't even want to say daily you know when I was a boy they used to sing this song as a special song in church one day at a time sweet Jesus and now we understand that even a day at a time is not enough to connect with him we need to do it through the day we need to give him praise through the day lord I thank you for that I thank you for that you know it's tempting sometimes when something good happens in our life to kind of pet ourselves on the back and say oh I did good I really did good but that didn't but I've learned it is so much more effective to say lord I thank you that your grace your grace has accomplished that for me Lord I'm so thankful that your spirit led me into a place where I could allow you to do such and such a thing in my life and that builds your faith when you see God moving and working according to your prayer and your faith it strengthens your faith because faith is like a muscle the more we use it the more we apply it the more we stretch it even believing God for bigger things I want to be able to believe for for what looks impossible because that's how faith operates anyway to transform the impossible to the possible for the glory of God I'm not talking about things just to accomplish them for myself I'm not talking about just to get riches for myself I'm talking about to accomplish things for the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for and for the sake of his kingdom so we can be we can be united with the Word of God by adding our faith to it by fellows shipping it with everything that's within us let me see if I can get this verse again in the in the amplified I wanted to get the second part of that and I think I may have stopped reading it in the middle so I'm gonna just read verse 2 all the way through again for indeed we have had the glad tidings the gospel of God proclaimed to us as truly as they the Israelites of old did when they when the good news of deliverance from bondage came to them but the message they heard did not benefit them because it was not mixed with faith and then that beautiful definition with the leaning of the entire personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in his power his wisdom and His goodness by those who heard it neither were they united in faith with the ones who heard it who did believe and in the amplified it says Joshua and Caleb their names are mentioned here so they they had in other words not only did it keep them out because they didn't mix their faith with the word that God had given to them through the Prophet but it actually broke off their fellowship with those who did believe Joshua and Caleb were taking the word of the Lord seriously and we know that for instance in the story of the spies the 12 spies that went in to spy out the land to see if indeed they were able to take it and the Bible tells us that 10 of those spies came back with complaints ten of them came back with gripes but here came Joshua and Caleb with the grapes it's not that Joshua and Caleb didn't see the Giants it's not that they didn't see that there was going to be difficulty and that it wasn't going to be an automatic surrender on the other side of the river but they chose rather to emphasize to focus on a land that was flowing with milk and honey and their testimony was a little bit different than the other spies the other spies said why those giants are there and they look at us as though we were grasshoppers and surely they're going to crunch us underneath their sandals so to speak but Joshua and Caleb their testimony was we are well able to take the land let us go up at once for we are well able to take the land the ten spies were looking at themselves they were looking at the ability of the people to be able to go in and conquer the Giants Joshua and Caleb were looking rather at the power of their God remember the same God that brought them all the way through the wilderness you mean to tell me the God who drowned Pharaoh's armies and chariots in the Red Sea is not big enough to deal with some Giants over there on the other side of the river that's how some of the people were acting but not Joshua and Caleb our God can deliver our God is victorious our God will give us the victory all we have to do is get up and get over there and by making such a testimony what were they doing mixing their faith with the word if they would have just folded their hands and sat in the little service and said well we're going to wait right here on God and one day God will come and he will make away and he will deliver us and one day all the Giants will die with the disease and then it'll be easy for us to go in well that would've been very passive no they didn't sit there and wait on the deliverance they put their faith in as an investment and they said the God who has brought us this far is the God who will take us the rest of the way so let's get up and get at it let's do something with the word that we've heard and what did they do they mix their faith with it and they got up and got into action I hope I know that I'm really pressing this issue and I pray that you won't get weary with me I pray that you'll get inspired if you and I are willing to put our faith into action joining it with the Word of God then the full effectiveness of the word becomes our inheritance everything God promised to do he will do for us we begin to come right under that beautiful promise it's a personal promise now to me I think I mentioned this phrase we used to sing this little chorus every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line I'm trusting in His grace divine every promise in the book is mine and I just encourage you oh okay maybe it sounds a little strange to somebody maybe it sounds juvenile even you're just telling Sunday school stories and expecting us to believe well all I know is this friend with every fiber of who I am I believe this book I can't tell you that there are not times that the enemy has moved against me with unbelief I can't tell you that there have not been times that I struggled and staggered to stand firm on my belief in this word but I can tell you at this moment in my life every fiber of who I am I believe that everything God has said this book he is more than able to do and I have seen him do what he promised that he would do I mentioned a few broadcast back that with my own eyes the eyes that I'm looking at this camera with right now I have seen the power of God demonstrated in ways that we read about in the scripture I've seen cancerous tumors fall off of people's bodies before my eyes in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I've seen the blinded eyes opened and I've been present when deaf ears were unstopped I've heard people speak their first words as adults I've heard the testimonies of those who heard for the first time the singing of the bird and the running of the water to to make the to make the dish water to wash the dishes I remember the little sister who got healed and she was thanking the Lord for every sound that you and I would take for granted she even testified I got on the bus and wrote downtown to do my business and I heard the motors running and I thanked God that he had healed me and opened my ears even some of the noises that would be a little bit annoying to you and I she was thanking God with tears lord thank you for for the she said I heard the neighbor out building the fence pounding the hammer you and I might we might get tired of that but she was so grateful so thankful I have seen these things I've heard these things I'm not taking somebody else's word for what God is able to do I'm telling you as a living witness that God is able to do exceedingly abundantly above that which we could even ask or think we approach him with our faith joined to the Word of God and we believe let's do that right now father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah I joined my faith with with many who are lifting their faith to you right now believing Lord whatever their confession is if it's according to your word in faith I believe it and I stand with them in this moment because I know you are still the healer and you are still able to deliver the addicted and the oppressed and the depressed I know that you are still able Lord to provide and and to bring into our lives what we have need of and so I'm asking you right now in in that precious name of the Lord and according to the promise of your great word I'm asking you to move right now Lord I ask you for this I ask you could there be a witness in in the home of those watching right now could they just I it's not my feeling Lord I know but maybe you just let them feel something feel your spirit your presence just moving right now to confirm to them that there's a God on the other end of this prayer and that you are more than able if they are willing to walk before you with simple trust leaning their whole personality on you and their full confidence and trust in your wisdom in your goodness in your power Lord let them have confirmation that you are the same yesterday and today and forever we ask this in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ send us your prayer requests and your testimonies because I believe God I believe God's Word god bless you today thank you for watching bye bye for now [Music] [Applause] [Music]
