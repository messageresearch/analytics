[0:17] Lord Jesus Christ it's your faith and
[0:20] it's been tried by the fire would be

[1:14] he-man
[1:15] turn in your Bibles if you will please -
[1:18] oh my where shall I go read with me John
[1:25] five chapter and five and verse 19 and
[1:30] 20 then answered Jesus and said unto
[1:34] them verily verily I say unto you the
[1:39] son can do nothing of himself but what
[1:44] he seeth the father do for what things
[1:48] soever he doeth these also doeth the son
[1:54] likewise but the father loveth the son
[1:58] and show with him all things that
[2:03] himself doeth and he will show him
[2:06] greater works than these that ye may
[2:13] Marvel that's powerful isn't it let's
[2:16] read that one again for the father
[2:18] loveth the son and show if him all
[2:21] things that himself doeth and he will
[2:25] show him greater works than these that
[2:29] she may Marvel and now little sisters if
[2:33] you would give me verse 30 of the same
[2:35] chapter I'd like to read John five
[2:37] thirty I can of mine own self do nothing
[2:43] as I hear I judge and my judgment is
[2:48] just because I seek not mine own will
[2:53] but the will of the Father which hath
[2:58] sent me can you say Amen
[3:02] these are the words of Jesus he is our
[3:06] supreme and ultimate example in all
[3:10] things I think that most of us would
[3:15] readily admit admit that we say too much
[3:19] and do too much that the
[3:23] father the Spirit of God within us is
[3:25] not leading us to do we would all be
[3:28] better off waiting on the nudging z' of
[3:31] the Lord do you believe that how many of
[3:33] you believe he lives that close to you
[3:34] right inside of you that he can nudge
[3:38] you and speak to you and lead you if
[3:41] you're willing to be led let's pray
[3:43] father you are so wonderful and so
[3:47] faithful to your children we have
[3:50] nothing to murmur about we have no
[3:53] complaints this morning because you are
[3:56] just and true I thank you Lord for
[4:00] walking with your children and I thank
[4:04] you for living in your children this is
[4:07] the promise of the Holy Ghost we need
[4:09] you this morning do for a few minutes
[4:12] let us dismiss all of the other worries
[4:17] and concerns and thoughts of our present
[4:20] life and for a little while Lord would
[4:24] you anoint every one of us to be able to
[4:28] pull in faith upon your word that you
[4:32] might speak a word to us in season
[4:35] something that we could anchor our soul
[4:39] to something that would direct our
[4:42] footsteps this week we take authority
[4:45] over every spirit of darkness that
[4:50] opposes the revealing and shining of the
[4:54] great light of God that lives in the
[4:57] people of God he would like to distract
[5:00] this morning but we thank you for the
[5:03] power by Jesus to rebuke that spirit and
[5:07] send it on its way we invite the glory
[5:12] cloud presence of God to come in this
[5:15] room and settle our nerves and settle
[5:18] our emotions and let us feast upon the
[5:22] Living Word of God Lord we ask it in the
[5:25] name of our Messiah Yeshua in the name
[5:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[5:32] and the Saints said a man you may be
[5:35] seated
[5:37] the last time that we were together in
[5:40] the word we were talking about what a
[5:44] supernatural God we serve how many of
[5:49] you serve a supernatural God I serve a
[5:53] supernatural God and I find that we as
[5:57] human beings have a tendency to limit
[6:01] God by our own thinking what we think he
[6:07] can do or what we think will happen or
[6:11] what we have maybe seen in the past and
[6:15] we just figure it will always be that
[6:18] way but I want you to know we serve a
[6:20] supernatural God who is above and beyond
[6:24] anything you and I could imagine and get
[6:26] ahold of this human finite mind right
[6:31] now it's not big enough to get a hold of
[6:34] the concept of who God really is but one
[6:39] day as we stand in his presence he will
[6:43] continue to unveil his glory to us and
[6:46] we will know more about him over there
[6:49] than we have known about him over here
[6:51] but he is revealing himself to his
[6:54] people by his word in these last days do
[6:58] you believe that because when it comes
[7:01] we're going to know him we're going to
[7:04] recognize him and it's not going to be
[7:07] by signs and wonders only because we
[7:10] know that there is a false amen it's not
[7:15] going to be my feelings because we know
[7:17] that we can have a lot of feelings how
[7:20] many of you have ever felt good one
[7:21] minute and ready to die the next
[7:23] feelings have nothing to do with faith
[7:26] and so there is something on the inside
[7:29] of us that has a connection to God that
[7:33] cannot be broken he's given us the gift
[7:37] of faith and faith is an anchor we've
[7:41] just got to keep throwing our faith
[7:43] anchor over into the realm of the unseen
[7:47] into the dimension
[7:49] of the supernatural into that spirit
[7:52] realm that the Bible tells us so much
[7:55] about and let our anchor drop over there
[7:58] in the unseen and take that as your
[8:02] absolute you see this is not reality in
[8:08] that something to say this is not
[8:11] reality in its fullness reality in its
[8:14] fullness is beyond the curtain of time
[8:18] reality in its fullness is in the realm
[8:20] of eternity thank God every one of us
[8:24] have a measure of eternity living inside
[8:28] of us by eternal life eternal life is a
[8:33] portion of eternity it's a seed of
[8:37] eternity that's been planted in every
[8:41] believer who has been baptized with the
[8:43] life of Jesus Christ if you're thankful
[8:46] for that measure of eternity in you you
[8:48] ought to thank God we ought to praise
[8:50] Him right now that he has not left us
[8:53] here in this world to grope around in
[8:57] the darkness not knowing that there's
[8:59] something more real than the realm we
[9:02] live in brother Branham talked about
[9:04] this being the negative that being the
[9:07] positive what we are looking at is like
[9:12] the old days when we used to get our
[9:14] film developed and we couldn't hardly
[9:18] wait because by the time we got around
[9:21] to getting it to the drugstore we forgot
[9:23] what was on it did that ever happen to
[9:26] you what if I told you I saw the other
[9:29] day in the battery drawer three rolls of
[9:32] undeveloped film I don't have any idea
[9:38] what's on them sister Joyce said send
[9:44] them off so you can see but if you will
[9:47] remember you would get your little
[9:49] packets of I remember when they first
[9:53] offered to give us a disc they print
[9:57] your photos and then they give you a
[9:59] disc so you can put them on your
[10:00] computer and we thought we were
[10:03] really in the jetsons days you know and
[10:06] now you don't even fool with all of that
[10:08] you just take it and you got it it's
[10:10] there and what in the world did Mariah
[10:13] want the other day but a Polaroid camera
[10:18] who wants to go back but anyway you'd
[10:21] get your prints and then in a tiny
[10:24] little sleeve you would get these little
[10:27] strips of negatives and you my they seem
[10:31] to multiply they fall out of the package
[10:35] the envelope and you're trying to figure
[10:37] out what envelope to put them back in I
[10:40] want you to see that should have brought
[10:42] some for your Millennials I told one of
[10:48] the nurses this week you Millennials and
[10:51] she really got a big kick out of that
[10:53] because there's so much that they don't
[10:56] know anything about you say oh but what
[10:58] they know about is so much better I
[11:01] don't know if it's all better or not but
[11:03] anyway I still would like to know
[11:05] history wouldn't you and where people
[11:07] have been anybody that doesn't know what
[11:08] a telephone booth is I think they've
[11:10] been hiding out playing video games too
[11:12] long
[11:13] least you should know what it is even if
[11:15] you've never seen it phone booth it's
[11:19] not complicated but you get those
[11:22] negatives I want you to see those in
[11:24] your mind if you have ever had any that
[11:27] is where we're living you can get an
[11:32] idea of what the the film was developed
[11:35] to be everybody kind of looks skeletal
[11:41] all the face details were not so good
[11:45] you could usually look at the size of
[11:47] the person and figure out who they were
[11:49] hush or the size of their hair and
[11:54] figure out who they were got you back
[11:59] but you couldn't tell everything about
[12:02] it you think you got it but you really
[12:05] didn't know what light had struck until
[12:10] you saw the print that was really the
[12:13] best image of reality
[12:17] close as the camera technology in that
[12:20] day would allow reality to be captured
[12:23] and then that's just a print of reality
[12:27] but this is a good analogy that brother
[12:30] Branham talked about because we can see
[12:32] that strip of negative that is where we
[12:35] are living and yet we put so much on
[12:39] that which matter so little when what
[12:44] really matters is over yonder in the
[12:47] unseen realm oh if we can get ahold of
[12:52] that and live in that realm while
[12:56] walking through the negative if we can
[12:59] keep our spirit reaching out for what is
[13:03] over there in our eternal promise while
[13:06] we're going through difficulties down
[13:08] here
[13:09] I believe God will help us maintain our
[13:11] praise you can maintain your praise no
[13:15] matter what you're going through
[13:17] this morning if you'll reach your faith
[13:20] over there into that unseen realm and
[13:23] say Jesus that is more real that is more
[13:28] real than what I'm walking through this
[13:30] morning it really is that is reality
[13:36] in fact brother Branham preaching on
[13:39] these subjects many years ago for those
[13:42] of you who don't know he was a mighty
[13:45] prophet of God that was used one
[13:47] generation ago to help deliver a message
[13:51] to prepare an endtime people for the
[13:55] Lord Jesus Christ many great men of God
[13:58] made their contribution to Christianity
[14:01] as it is today but I'm so thankful for
[14:04] that scriptural contribution that he
[14:07] made very thankful and I'm not ashamed
[14:10] at all to mention his name because it
[14:12] what I heard over there what I learned
[14:16] if by the Spirit in hearing some of
[14:19] those sermons it has certainly molded me
[14:23] in and helped me to understand the Word
[14:26] of God gray
[14:27] gaps and great mysteries that we can now
[14:31] understand because Jesus has revealed
[14:33] himself my what a blessed people we
[14:37] really are to be able to get a good
[14:39] picture a full picture and he said to a
[14:44] fellow one time when they were talking
[14:46] the man said you know I don't believe
[14:48] anything that science can't prove he
[14:52] said well you know what my philosophy is
[14:54] different than yours
[14:55] he said if if science can prove it I
[14:58] don't I don't really believe it I know
[15:02] that's a pretty strong statement I'm
[15:04] just telling what he said he said what I
[15:06] really believe in its what science
[15:08] cannot prove because it's supernatural
[15:11] and yet I believe it how many of you are
[15:16] not ashamed to be identified with a
[15:18] group of people who believe things that
[15:21] cannot yet be scientifically proven you
[15:25] see they're angels in this room this
[15:27] morning I can't prove that
[15:29] scientifically but I can prove it by the
[15:32] word so I believe that divine healing is
[15:38] the children's bread I may not be able
[15:40] to prove that scientifically this
[15:42] morning but I can prove it by the word
[15:44] and what I've seen God do for many many
[15:47] many many many of us through the years
[15:49] so you've got to believe what you can't
[15:53] see your faith has got to be willing to
[15:58] take God at His Word no matter what the
[16:02] report is no matter what the doctor says
[16:04] he's able he is able now just let me
[16:10] mention this before we move on to where
[16:12] we want to go this morning the word
[16:14] supernatural it means above and beyond
[16:18] the natural this is the realm where God
[16:22] operates he moves from that realm the
[16:26] unseen realm and he moves in the realm
[16:30] of the seen the atmosphere around us and
[16:34] in our present time in the frame of time
[16:37] God moves but he doesn't move
[16:40] from time to eternity he moves from
[16:42] eternity into time one of these days
[16:46] time will be no more that's going to be
[16:48] a glorious day isn't it the supernatural
[16:51] realm is around where heaven and earth
[16:54] intermingle it is the realm of
[16:57] interaction between God and man we're
[17:00] really caught in to that other realm any
[17:04] time God touches us physically we remain
[17:07] over here but spiritually we are caught
[17:11] up does that trouble anybody because the
[17:13] Apostle tells us in the New Testament I
[17:16] read it last time we were together I
[17:17] think in 2nd Corinthians 12 verses 1
[17:20] through 5 about a man caught up into
[17:23] that third heaven and heard things that
[17:26] were not lawful to be uttered I don't
[17:28] think his physical body went anywhere
[17:32] but that part of him that was God's it
[17:36] moved into that other realm of the
[17:39] supernatural and he saw things that had
[17:42] never been seen by human eye I don't
[17:45] believe Paul was the last one to have
[17:47] that experience and I believe that more
[17:50] of us would have interaction with that
[17:52] realm if we would attach our faith to
[17:54] what is unseen and that we would keep
[17:57] speaking the Word of God and the
[17:59] promises of God over and over again no
[18:02] matter what it looks like or what it
[18:04] feels like turn with me this morning to
[18:09] Ephesians chapter 6 this is a familiar
[18:12] portion of Scripture and verse 10
[18:15] finally my brethren be strong in the
[18:19] Lord and in the power of his mind I want
[18:23] you to know that strength is not
[18:25] dependent on your human strength when
[18:29] you feel like you can't put one foot in
[18:33] front of another there is another
[18:35] strength I want you to help me there is
[18:39] another strength that we can move in but
[18:44] it's not automatic it just does not fall
[18:49] on us automatic so what do we have to do
[18:53] brother
[18:54] shellye what we have to do is when we
[18:56] realize that we've gone as far as we can
[18:58] go in our human strength in that moment
[19:02] we have to consciously make a decision
[19:05] by faith to reach over into that unseen
[19:08] realm how do we do that by speaking
[19:10] God's Word now Lord you said now Lord it
[19:14] is written here Lord I believe your Lord
[19:17] says and when you speak that you are
[19:22] attaching faith to it it is a confession
[19:25] amen and your spiritual confession
[19:29] according to the word has power to shift
[19:32] the atmosphere around you that's not
[19:34] metaphysical that's good old Bible if we
[19:37] have the spirit to help us read it and
[19:39] understand it you have to take a moment
[19:42] and say now Lord I've gone as far as I
[19:46] can go how do you know so much about
[19:48] that I got a lot of practice Lord I've
[19:51] gone as far as I can go today and I
[19:56] can't go any farther in my own strength
[19:58] I feel like my sanity is slipping away
[20:02] like my strength you've got to come as
[20:06] you promised
[20:07] you said Lord and you just start spewing
[20:11] it out greater is He that is in me than
[20:15] he that is in the world Lord you said
[20:18] you wouldn't allow me to suffer more
[20:20] than I would be able to stand under you
[20:22] said that in those moments you would not
[20:26] only be there you would undergird me and
[20:28] lift me up you not only said I could
[20:31] lead on you as the everlasting arms but
[20:34] you have provided a tower of refuge and
[20:37] strength and you just start speaking
[20:39] what you know somebody said what good
[20:42] does it do if momentarily disconnects
[20:46] you from your natural circumstances I
[20:50] somebody said here standing here
[20:54] maybe it's brother Greely who said
[20:55] something about our faith being what was
[20:59] his words energized that's what happens
[21:03] when your faith gets weak somebody said
[21:06] I don't have enough
[21:07] to get over there in the unseen realm
[21:10] you don't need a whole lot you just have
[21:13] to use what you've got you've been given
[21:16] the measure required just use whatever
[21:19] little bit of faith you have and say
[21:22] Lord I take you at your word let me see
[21:27] let me feel
[21:29] let me hear just a moment of what it's
[21:32] like over there in that unseen realm the
[21:36] realm of the Spirit the realm of truth
[21:39] the realm of thus sayeth the Lord are
[21:42] you following me this morning you know
[21:45] he goes on put on the whole armour of
[21:47] God that she may be able to stand
[21:49] against the wiles of the devil for we
[21:52] wrestle not against flesh and blood by
[21:55] my mind someone said to me recently I
[22:01] will do my best not to tell you the
[22:04] details and circumstances of the
[22:06] situation someone said to me recently it
[22:10] began to feel like a spiritual conflict
[22:15] how do I know where the Shelly if what
[22:18] I'm going through is a spiritual
[22:20] conflict are you going through it is it
[22:26] touching your life is it a part of your
[22:31] present circumstance and reality than
[22:34] its spiritual somebody said I don't know
[22:38] if you can make a blanket statement like
[22:39] that you can as soon as you begin to
[22:41] realize who you are and that not only
[22:44] are you serving a supernatural God but
[22:47] you indeed our supernatural bride very
[22:54] natural and very supernatural all at the
[22:58] same time is that who we are and so
[23:01] anything that comes up in your life
[23:03] there's going to be at least a spiritual
[23:08] element attached to that situation don't
[23:14] be a fanatic don't be a you know a
[23:17] spiritual ghost
[23:19] Buster looking for a demon under every
[23:23] rock just be wise be mindful of who you
[23:28] are but know that the enemy would like
[23:31] to take advantage of everything you face
[23:34] to trip you to distract you to pull you
[23:40] in a wrong direction to make a life
[23:43] decision or choice that would alter your
[23:47] future and cause you to veer off the
[23:50] course of God's ordained destiny plan
[23:53] for you
[23:54] so everything that touches you but let
[23:57] me let me say it like this if it touches
[23:59] you it touches God I need some scripture
[24:03] for that cast that doesn't mean you know
[24:10] just casually it means we're not talking
[24:15] about cane pole fishing we're talking
[24:19] about casting kind we're talking about
[24:23] putting some effort and getting it out
[24:26] of my hand you and me cast all your
[24:39] cares somebody said I could I really
[24:43] need a new pair of tennis shoes it
[24:46] better not be none of mine saying it I
[24:51] think they just got something didn't
[24:53] they maybe it feels that way anyway
[24:55] doesn't it now I'm not going to bother
[25:00] the Lord with that all right just go
[25:03] right against the scripture if you want
[25:04] to but if that's a care and concern
[25:07] maybe you need them maybe you're not
[25:10] just trying to be fashionable someone
[25:16] sent me a leak and I had a lot of time
[25:21] it didn't have my laptop with me that
[25:23] day read the Bible and did everything
[25:25] else I knew to do while mama was
[25:27] sleeping and I followed that link and it
[25:30] is something like preachers and sneakers
[25:33] and it showed pictures of all the famous
[25:37] preachers in America and how much they
[25:39] pay for their Sonique errs well I didn't
[25:45] know my shoes was so cheap I've always
[25:48] thought my shoes were expensive I didn't
[25:50] know you could have sneakers $3,500
[25:53] repaired $7,000 a pair and I know I'm
[25:59] not jealous over those sneakers but most
[26:04] of us we don't we're not asking for
[26:07] another pair like that we just need a
[26:10] pair to walk in right and we'd like for
[26:13] him to look cool forgive me Lord for
[26:15] saying that word I hate it if you've got
[26:19] a need God cares if there's something
[26:23] you care about God cares about it cast
[26:28] all of your cares on me he said for I
[26:31] care for you so God does care he is
[26:36] concerned about whatever it is that we
[26:39] are going through and the war that we're
[26:41] fighting is not against human beings
[26:44] it's not against the IRS it's not
[26:47] Democrats against Republicans it's
[26:50] certainly not African Americans against
[26:52] Caucasians this war is much larger than
[26:56] that this is a wrestling match between
[27:00] principalities powers rulers of the
[27:04] darkness of this world spiritual
[27:07] wickedness in high places it's not just
[27:13] the Jezebel in the church spirit Jezebel
[27:17] spirit in the church you've got to be
[27:18] concerned about but you got to be
[27:20] concerned about the one that sets in
[27:22] government because that spirit of
[27:26] control is alive and well we do what we
[27:30] can naturally to combat that but we must
[27:33] understand that this is a battle that is
[27:36] not between just people this is a
[27:38] spiritual battle spiritual wickedness in
[27:41] high places how do we prepare ourselves
[27:44] for a spiritual battle I don't even
[27:47] think I don't even know I'm in well I
[27:48] didn't even realize I was in one well
[27:51] there's your problem right there you've
[27:54] been in one all along and you didn't
[27:57] even realize that's where you were that
[27:59] means you had nothing to go against it
[28:02] you had nothing to counteract you had
[28:04] nothing to fight with
[28:05] because you didn't even know you were in
[28:07] a spiritual war but you are because
[28:09] you're a blood ball sanctified Holy
[28:11] Ghost field child of the Living God and
[28:14] hell hates you Satan wants to destroy
[28:18] you ten millions of demons want to
[28:22] destroy your life you're in a spiritual
[28:25] battle whether you've been fighting it
[28:27] as one or not
[28:28] the quicker you understand that you may
[28:31] think you're just getting by and you're
[28:33] off the radar
[28:35] you are not off the radar you are
[28:37] targeted in this hour for great pain and
[28:40] anxiety targeted but you've got an
[28:43] answer o have an answer I have a remedy
[28:48] I even have something proactive I don't
[28:54] only have to move defensively but God
[28:57] has provided an offensive plan for my
[28:59] life and Ephesians 6 tells us what it is
[29:03] stay with me he said we're four verse
[29:05] thirteen take unto you the whole armour
[29:09] of God you know this that she may be
[29:12] able to withstand in the evil day is
[29:14] this an evil day huh you think this is
[29:17] the evil day it is and until Jesus comes
[29:22] tomorrow's going to be more evil than
[29:24] today yes we're surrounded by darkness
[29:29] that's why we've got to shine with
[29:32] everything that's within us that you may
[29:35] be able to withstand in the evil day and
[29:37] having done all to stand stand therefore
[29:41] having your loins gird about with truth
[29:43] and having on the breastplate of
[29:46] righteousness and your feet shod with
[29:48] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[29:51] above all taking the shield of faith
[29:53] mine what does the shield protect
[29:58] it protects some pretty vital organs of
[30:02] your body doesn't it including your
[30:05] heart how many of you know you can't
[30:07] live long without a heart that's working
[30:10] properly so God gives us faith to
[30:13] protect ourselves in those vulnerable
[30:16] areas stand there for your loins Girt
[30:20] about with truth having on the
[30:22] breastplate of righteousness your feet
[30:24] shod with the preparation of the gospel
[30:27] of peace above all taking the shield of
[30:30] faith wherewith you shall be able to
[30:33] quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
[30:35] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[30:39] sword of the Spirit which is the word of
[30:42] God praying always with all power and
[30:44] supplication in the spirit and watching
[30:47] thereunto with all perseverance and
[30:50] supplication for All Saints God has
[30:53] provided a an armor a spiritual armor
[30:58] for you to wear you really believe that
[31:01] well I didn't put it on this morning
[31:03] well it might be a good idea for you to
[31:05] remind yourself that you have an armor
[31:09] before you go out and face reality but I
[31:12] want you to know it's mine and if I
[31:16] don't remember to put it on I got it you
[31:20] see the thing about my armor is it's
[31:22] unseen and since it's unseen it doesn't
[31:25] disturb me when I sleep so I don't have
[31:29] to take it off to go to bed put it on
[31:31] when I get up in the morning unless
[31:32] that's just a discipline that you you
[31:34] like to do I know people have done that
[31:36] I've even done that at different times
[31:38] in my life wake up read the scripture
[31:40] and say now today Lord I need the
[31:44] breastplate of righteousness
[31:45] I need the helmet of salvation today but
[31:49] because your supernatural people who
[31:52] serve a supernatural God the armor of
[31:55] the Lord is on you even though it is
[31:58] unseen it should be unseen it's from the
[32:02] unseen realm
[32:03] it's from the dimension of the
[32:06] supernatural if you're still with me say
[32:08] man let me give you some quotations here
[32:11] the
[32:11] have been helpful to me one is from a
[32:14] message called it wasn't so from the
[32:17] beginning he said now we find our Lord
[32:20] then in his work that he claimed to do
[32:24] nothing of himself only what he seen the
[32:28] father doing he gave all praise to God
[32:32] thing that was unnatural supernatural
[32:37] every armour that we have brother all of
[32:42] our armor is supernatural he said what
[32:47] about the fruit of the Spirit love faith
[32:49] love joy peace long-suffering meekness
[32:52] gentleness patience he said now you go
[32:56] down to the drugstore and buy me a
[32:58] quarters worth of patients he said I
[33:01] need it
[33:02] I felt that way this week buy me five
[33:07] dollars worth of love he said I could
[33:10] stand a lot of that he said see that's
[33:12] not how it works
[33:13] it's the unseen something that's our
[33:17] whole armor we stand listen we stand in
[33:23] the unseen world looking at the unseen
[33:27] things yet to us we see them yet to us
[33:37] we see them because our faith detects
[33:42] them and our faith says it's there you
[33:49] hear that so if I should ask you do you
[33:53] have on the helmet of salvation why do
[33:56] you need something on your head you've
[33:58] got something pretty important up there
[34:00] that needs to be protected it needs to
[34:04] be constantly revealed the work of
[34:08] redemption in our thoughts is not
[34:10] something that is you know finished and
[34:15] we never have to grow in that our
[34:18] thoughts are daily being redeemed if we
[34:21] present them to the Lord Lord you know I
[34:23] don't want to think
[34:24] Fath that is not how I want to spend my
[34:26] day thinking like that I'm asking you to
[34:29] come and give me grace over these
[34:30] thoughts I want to think from another
[34:33] realm I want to get my inspiration from
[34:35] another dimension you mean you really
[34:38] take the time to we better because how
[34:41] many of you know you can wake up feeling
[34:42] okay and it can be all downhill from
[34:44] there and you don't have to face any new
[34:47] reality any new situation just start
[34:49] rehearsing the old one the things you've
[34:51] been going through it gets bigger and
[34:53] bigger and heavier and heavier and you
[34:55] are totally unaware that in that moment
[34:58] of turmoil and in that moment of pain in
[35:00] that moment of feeling completely
[35:02] forsaken you are laying there or
[35:04] standing there with the whole armor of
[35:07] God on it's there you just have to be
[35:12] aware of it and receive it by faith you
[35:15] activate it by faith your feet shod with
[35:19] the preparation of peace the sword of
[35:22] the Spirit the Word of God is given us
[35:25] for a weapon here's what we need to
[35:29] understand let me give you this in the
[35:30] amplified and we'll move on for a little
[35:32] while longer second Corinthians chapter
[35:35] four and verse eight in the amplified
[35:39] zowie second Corinthians chapter four
[35:49] since we consider and look not to the
[35:54] things that are seen but to the things
[35:59] that are unseen for the things that are
[36:04] visible are temporal brief and fleeting
[36:10] why is it that something can feel so
[36:15] final it seems that in our thought
[36:25] process we can look at a particularly
[36:29] desperate problem and decide in our
[36:33] minds their will there's no room for two
[36:38] it's always been this way and it will
[36:41] always be this way if you ever felt that
[36:44] way I know you have because you're human
[36:47] beings this will never pass this is my
[36:51] lot in life it'll always I'll always be
[36:54] misunderstood nobody will ever get me
[36:57] you can really get bogged down in
[37:02] something and decide that it is always
[37:05] going to be this way when the scripture
[37:08] tells us we are not looking to things
[37:12] that are seen but to the things that are
[37:14] unseen for the things that are visible
[37:17] are temporal brief and fleeting but the
[37:22] things that are invisible I want to make
[37:27] sure you hear that invisible can't see
[37:30] faith you can see faith in action but
[37:34] you can't see faith you can see love in
[37:37] action but you can't see love you can
[37:40] see joy and demonstration but you can't
[37:42] see joy but how many of you know Joe is
[37:44] real you believe joy is real you believe
[37:47] faith is real you be love is real but
[37:50] you can't see it you can if you know
[37:53] where you're looking you're looking in
[37:56] faith to the unseen realm and that is
[37:59] the eternal existence not what you're
[38:02] going through right now I like that song
[38:05] they used to sing it didn't come to stay
[38:07] it came to pass our problem is we don't
[38:12] we don't often know how long it's going
[38:14] to be here and with God comforts us he
[38:17] often says something like it'll be
[38:20] better soon how many of you get nervous
[38:24] when God says soon my soon and my
[38:31] suddenly doesn't always line up with God
[38:34] soon and God suddenly but here's another
[38:37] man that he should lie neither the son
[38:40] of man that he would have need to repent
[38:42] if God said it it's settled brother
[38:44] sister you just got to hold on to it
[38:45] with everything you've got
[38:47] listen to this we have to train
[38:50] ourselves
[38:51] were to look not only do we have to
[38:55] train ourselves what to think we have to
[38:57] train ourselves where to look we have to
[39:00] make a spiritual conscious faith-filled
[39:02] effort to choose to look beyond the
[39:06] scene to the unseen realm of faith with
[39:11] men things are impossible but with God
[39:17] how many things all things are possible
[39:25] how many of you know of some things in
[39:27] your life or in the lives of somebody
[39:30] you love that seemed to already have the
[39:33] ending it just seems final it has to be
[39:39] this way most of us could think of
[39:45] something in our life that feels very
[39:47] finished but I want you to know God has
[39:52] a track record of doing the impossible
[39:58] when somebody dares to believe all
[40:03] things are possible we just train
[40:07] ourselves where to look our flesh nature
[40:10] will always turn to the natural
[40:13] circumstances that surround us you agree
[40:16] with that statement but we have another
[40:18] nature his spirit in us eternity in us
[40:24] joy life of God in us and that other
[40:30] nature will often remind us and provoke
[40:36] us to look to the other realm the
[40:40] reality of the supernatural unseen realm
[40:45] how many of you have ever had the Holy
[40:47] Spirit of God in your moment of despair
[40:50] just finger you just tap you somehow I
[40:57] guess it's really up here isn't it and
[40:59] all of a sudden you think of this maybe
[41:02] maybe you think of but God
[41:05] I hear what you say demo but you don't
[41:09] get the final word I'm not just looking
[41:13] at what I see I'm looking to the unseen
[41:16] realm I serve a supernatural God I'm a
[41:20] part of a supernatural bride that he's
[41:23] building in these last days I'm going to
[41:26] take him at his word he goes on let me
[41:30] let me share another quote sir we would
[41:32] see Jesus this is a very powerful sermon
[41:37] and it leads to some very powerful
[41:40] events that took place a generation ago
[41:45] he said in the whole Christian armor now
[41:48] is unseen the Christian looks at what he
[41:51] doesn't see natural now look that's the
[41:53] only way you can be a Christian you've
[41:56] got to believe God who you can't see he
[41:59] said watch here the whole Christian
[42:01] armor and he talks about the fruit of
[42:03] the Spirit love joy peace longsuffering
[42:04] so we take those as part of the armor he
[42:07] said see all those things are unseen but
[42:10] the things that unseen the things that
[42:13] are unseen are the ones that have the
[42:15] reality the un-- seen things listen to
[42:20] this calling Jesus on the scene he said
[42:23] you can't make yourself believe have you
[42:27] ever tried that's why atmosphere is so
[42:36] important I want to talk to you this a
[42:39] minute if you listen to me
[42:41] that's why atmosphere is so important
[42:44] because unless you're in a certain
[42:48] spiritual environment you will never be
[42:52] able to make yourself believe for
[42:56] certain things but when you get in that
[43:02] realm when you start worshiping the Lord
[43:10] when you start lifting up his name in
[43:14] your grief
[43:16] in your pain in your loss whatever's
[43:19] going on you feel like you want to pull
[43:22] your hair out don't do that it'll come
[43:24] out soon enough leave it in you feel
[43:28] like you just can't move forward and in
[43:32] that atmosphere entertaining those
[43:35] thoughts you will never be able to make
[43:37] yourself believe that God is about to
[43:40] rescue you but you just take a moment of
[43:44] time and say Lord excellent is your name
[43:52] your promises are yeni man you are the
[43:59] most faithful God all of your ways are
[44:04] just and righteous and holy and true you
[44:09] have made your people precious promises
[44:12] now music helps me to get in that
[44:18] atmosphere I was built that way and
[44:23] perhaps you were when I get under
[44:28] something that's inspired music that's
[44:31] inspired it doesn't always have to be my
[44:35] particular like and dislike if there's
[44:38] inspiration on it if it's from the Word
[44:42] of God
[44:43] it helps me move up a little higher no
[44:48] matter what's going on but you'd be
[44:50] surprised what kind of atmosphere I
[44:54] could build frustration will vanish it
[45:01] will just start dripping away when you
[45:03] start hearing things that remind you of
[45:05] who you serve and who lives in you and
[45:10] who is helping you you're not alone he's
[45:13] with you so if you're not in that
[45:16] atmosphere of inspiration of spirit it's
[45:21] impossible to make yourself believe
[45:26] but in that atmosphere in that realm
[45:29] faith is a sixth sense you hear what I'm
[45:34] telling you
[45:35] faith is a sixth sense it operates very
[45:39] similar to your other senses
[45:42] it requires stimulation inspiration see
[45:51] something hears something feel something
[45:54] experience something remember something
[45:57] and all of a sudden your faith level
[46:00] gets what was the word again energized
[46:04] you start lifting up out of your natural
[46:08] circumstances he went on to say it's a
[46:12] quality you can't make yourself believe
[46:15] it's a quality that's in you faith is
[46:21] the substance that's Hebrews 11:1 he
[46:25] said not just imaginary it's the
[46:29] substance of things hoped for the
[46:32] evidence of things that you believe and
[46:34] you don't see but you still believe them
[46:37] and all the whole Christian armor now
[46:40] remember every bit of it is by faith it
[46:44] is all supernatural it's all unseen
[46:49] things the Christian armor the Christian
[46:53] always looks at things that he does not
[46:56] see in that funny he looks at things
[47:04] that he does not see I don't know how
[47:09] much logical sense that makes but it
[47:11] makes a lot of sense to me it's really a
[47:16] paradox we can't see it with this eye
[47:20] but we can see it with a spiritual eye
[47:23] an eye of faith said God said it it's
[47:26] settled I'm gonna hold on to that are
[47:28] you with me we're getting ready to close
[47:30] I wish that it was all automatic
[47:38] but it's not we can't make ourselves
[47:43] believe but we can get in the right
[47:45] atmosphere and turn our faith loose how
[47:50] many of you know that Abraham found a
[47:52] God the scripture says that that God
[47:57] that Abraham got ahold of was a God that
[48:00] called things that are not as though
[48:05] they are that was the God he got ahold
[48:08] of and getting ahold of a God who calls
[48:12] things not as they are but as they
[48:16] should be it's why Abraham had faith to
[48:20] hold on to the promise every evidence
[48:23] that Abraham could see and could know
[48:27] and could discern said your your days
[48:29] are done but the promise of God said
[48:33] you're gonna be a father again and God
[48:36] made that possible at a hundred years
[48:37] old didn't he so it's important to
[48:40] remember something like that listen at
[48:42] this demonology is the sermon it comes
[48:45] from
[48:46] he said the whole armour of God is by
[48:48] faith we haven't got one natural thing
[48:50] of this world look at this armor and he
[48:53] gives the fruits of the spirit again
[48:55] love joy peace longsuffering goodness
[48:57] meekness gentleness patience he said is
[48:59] that right everything's supernatural
[49:01] nothing natural so we don't look at the
[49:03] natural because we're operating
[49:04] supernatural oh my I serve a
[49:08] supernatural God and I'm called to be a
[49:11] people a part of a people who operate in
[49:14] the supernatural and the only way we can
[49:16] base it is by faith faith on what God
[49:19] said was the truth and we look to the
[49:22] unseen and we call those things which
[49:26] are not as though they were like Abraham
[49:31] did being a hundred years old
[49:34] staggered not at the promise of God
[49:36] through unbelief even though he tried to
[49:39] help God out a little bit he still
[49:42] believed the promise that he was going
[49:44] to be a father
[49:45] he had more confidence in what he was
[49:48] going to do than what God was gonna do
[49:49] for Sarah
[49:50] did you notice that now this is a little
[49:57] lengthy so I'm gonna read this in closed
[49:59] its from possessing all things he said
[50:06] oh my how I I locked that it's a
[50:08] believers promise what's that got to do
[50:11] with us he said to every believer the
[50:15] believers promise is eternal life the
[50:18] believers promise his life joy peace
[50:21] longsuffering gentleness patience fruits
[50:23] of the spirit divine healing a dozen
[50:25] things I got wrote down here that is
[50:28] your possession it belongs to you but
[50:32] you cannot have it until you fight for
[50:39] it
[50:40] see it's not automatic first Timothy
[50:45] 6:12 in the amplified says fight the
[50:48] good fight of the faith lay hold of the
[50:51] eternal life to which you were summoned
[50:53] and for which you confessed the good
[50:56] confession of faith before many
[50:59] witnesses you've got to fight for it he
[51:03] said well they say let me get some
[51:08] scientific research and see if if
[51:10] that'll just sink in
[51:14] he said now they could probe around on
[51:17] that but he said I'm an heir to that
[51:21] science can try to figure it out but I
[51:25] have a promise as an heir to that he
[51:30] said then I'm also an heir to things
[51:32] that can't be seen unseen things I'm an
[51:37] heir to that every believer is an heir
[51:39] he's an heir to that to the unseen
[51:44] possessor of what what does the
[51:47] scripture say heaven and earth what a
[51:52] promise it's in first Corinthians and
[51:56] I'll close with the scripture first
[51:58] Corinthians 3 verses 21 through 23 King
[52:03] James 1st Corinthians 3 21 through 23
[52:09] therefore let no man glory in men read
[52:17] the rest read it out loud can we believe
[52:27] such a promise whether Paul or Apollo's
[52:32] or Cephas or the world or life or death
[52:36] or things present or things to come read
[52:42] those last three words and here's how we
[52:50] know that's true this verse
[52:53] let's read it out loud every one of us
[52:55] at will and ye are Christ's and Christ
[52:59] is God's can somebody say I'm in good
[53:04] hands I belong to Christ he he when he
[53:11] was here in earthly form he said I can't
[53:14] do anything but what I heard of the
[53:16] Father I've got to see it or hear it of
[53:18] the father I'm not here to do my will
[53:20] I'm here to do the will of him that sent
[53:22] me did you understand by scripture that
[53:26] you have the same inheritance this is
[53:29] what the scripture said everything
[53:30] Christ inherited from his eternal spit
[53:34] from thee let me start over
[53:37] everything Christ inherited from the
[53:40] eternal spirit of the Father we are
[53:44] entitled to by election and by his
[53:48] precious blood price that's who we are
[53:52] but one of the Prophet is saying here
[53:54] and it's all ours
[53:55] we have a right to claim every bit of it
[53:59] as our possession as our inheritance he
[54:04] said they asked him said brother Branham
[54:08] what about out there where you can't see
[54:10] he said how do you know he said that's
[54:12] still mine heaven belongs to me he said
[54:16] I'm glad
[54:16] and God said so well you've never seen
[54:19] it how do you know it's there he said I
[54:21] know it's there because God said so how
[54:24] do you know you're an heir to it if
[54:26] you've never seen it he said because I
[54:27] believe God's Word I'm an heir you're an
[54:30] heir with me we're all heirs together
[54:32] through Christ Jesus and this wasn't a
[54:35] prophet just taking license to tell us
[54:38] something that wasn't in the word we
[54:39] just read it from the word you belong to
[54:42] Christ Christ is in the hands of his
[54:45] eternal spirit of the Father led by him
[54:50] he said all that the father was he
[54:55] poured into the son and all that was in
[54:58] Jesus Christ he poured that out upon the
[55:01] head of the believers on the day of
[55:03] Pentecost you and I have that same
[55:06] inheritance we're not waiting to get it
[55:09] we're waiting to recognize it we're not
[55:12] waiting for it to be deposited
[55:14] we're waiting on faith to rise to the
[55:16] level to activate and use what has
[55:18] already been given to us by God's Word
[55:20] it's more than just changing your mind I
[55:24] believe in the power of thinking right
[55:26] but it's more than that it's shifting
[55:30] everything about the way you allow your
[55:33] thoughts to go and shifting everything
[55:36] back to being very very conscious of the
[55:39] Word of God and the God who lives inside
[55:41] of you I want you to know that church
[55:44] anity will never overcome in Satan's
[55:47] Eden a go to church once a month kind of
[55:51] walk with God we'll never survive in
[55:54] what's coming just around the corner you
[55:59] see it you see a building you feel it
[56:03] building there's an agenda it's no
[56:12] longer in the shadow it's among us
[56:15] it's a warfare Satan is out to destroy
[56:20] he wants to touch your home he wants to
[56:24] touch your family come on you let
[56:27] somebody touch your children and see how
[56:29] your feathers get
[56:30] you and I ought to be that way about
[56:32] every promise that's ours when the devil
[56:36] tries to talk us out of it not just the
[56:37] fruit of our body we ought to be just
[56:40] that
[56:40] zealous over every promise that God has
[56:43] given us in this life I desperately want
[56:46] to get to a section of this on who we
[56:49] are as the supernatural people but would
[56:51] you stand this morning have you ever
[57:00] asked the average person to try to
[57:04] explain the relationship between the
[57:09] father and the Son and the Holy Spirit
[57:16] I've discussed with some pretty learning
[57:20] folks at times and you know what the
[57:24] explanation is at best confusion and
[57:31] when you say do you does that make sense
[57:34] to you they say oh well it's not meant
[57:37] to make sense it's the mystery of the
[57:43] Trinity well the Bible says the mystery
[57:48] should be finished something's missing
[57:55] you have an understanding by the grace
[57:59] of God given to you by the Holy Spirit
[58:02] because you can read in the book and you
[58:05] can hear sermon on tape and not get it
[58:09] but when God gives you the Holy Spirit
[58:12] inspiration to receive a truth that
[58:14] becomes a revelation in you I want you
[58:17] to know I believe that one mystery is a
[58:23] key I do so important
[58:28] the final mystery cry
[58:36] is the mystery of God revealed right
[58:41] from the word the bride of Jesus Christ
[58:44] is Christ revealed the bride is the
[58:51] mystery of Christ revealed we hear that
[58:55] and it's just a little phrase that we
[58:57] pass around that's life-changing it
[59:02] changes everything I read an article
[59:06] that someone wrote yesterday and when I
[59:09] was finished reading it I said Lord
[59:11] please forgive me but if that's who you
[59:14] were I could not serve you I could not
[59:20] follow a God who is that weak and it was
[59:28] written by modern theology written
[59:33] really against the sovereignty of God
[59:35] putting you and I in more control than
[59:39] the God we serve
[59:41] I want you to know I can't serve a god
[59:43] weaker than his enemy the God that you
[59:49] and I serve is the Ancient of Days his
[59:56] knowledge and wisdom and understanding
[59:58] go all the way back before time and he
[1:00:04] knew then much of what we're walking
[1:00:07] through today
[1:00:08] he knew it way back then that's why we
[1:00:12] find this scripture that talks about
[1:00:14] whose names were written in the Lamb's
[1:00:17] Book of Life before the foundations of
[1:00:21] the world what a promise what a mystery
[1:00:26] that nothing that happened in the Garden
[1:00:28] of Eden took God by surprise nothing
[1:00:31] that happened in Calvary took God by
[1:00:34] surprise nothing that happened in the
[1:00:37] dark ages took God by surprise and
[1:00:41] nothing that happens in your life today
[1:00:44] is going to catch God by surprise
[1:00:49] he has seen it all every one of your
[1:00:52] days are written in his book before you
[1:00:54] were ever born he knows your good
[1:00:57] choices and your bad choices and yet
[1:01:01] knowing everything there is to know
[1:01:05] about us he loved us
