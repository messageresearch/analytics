[0:00] God has chosen to
[0:02] forget a whole lot of things he knew
[0:05] about
[0:07] youo Hallelujah Redemption is more than
[0:12] just forgiveness of sin Redemption is to
[0:16] be taken back to the original thoughts
[0:19] of God concerning your life so no matter
[0:24] what you've done or how long you have
[0:26] spent spinning your wheel
[0:29] [Music]
[0:31] no matter how long you spent on the
[0:33] gerbal
[0:35] wheel of
[0:37] performance trying to earn your
[0:40] salvation God looks over all of that he
[0:43] said you didn't need to waste those days
[0:45] but I'm a redeemer of
[0:48] time so as soon as you come to the
[0:50] revelation of who I am you'll also have
[0:53] a revelation of who you are because of
[0:56] who I am come on and I will redeem the
[1:06] years we're blessed people yes we are
[1:09] the word has set us free yes sir so he
[1:12] says to
[1:14] us I am joined to
[1:18] you like a
[1:19] [Music]
[1:21] wall so when it feels like the walls are
[1:24] closing in on
[1:26] us he is experiencing
[1:30] the same thing that we are experiencing
[1:33] somebody said I need that in the New
[1:35] Testament I'm glad you do the New
[1:38] Testament says he is
[1:41] touched with the feelings yes sir of our
[1:45] infirmities so when you hit a roadblock
[1:49] he does too yes sir that doesn't mean he
[1:51] can't move Beyond he's the only one that
[1:53] can but it means he feels your
[1:56] roadblock when you get stuck in the mud
[1:59] he feels you're stuck come on when you
[2:04] get weary and discouraged he feels your
[2:08] weariness yes sir he feels your
[2:11] discouragement the good thing is he's
[2:13] not a job's
[2:15] comforter he didn't just come to tell
[2:17] you why you got to where you are he came
[2:20] to do something about it aren't you glad
[2:23] you serve a god who's able to do
[2:27] something about it
[2:30] he's touched with the feeling of our
[2:34] infirmities all through the word we see
[2:37] God joining himself to the struggles of
[2:41] his
[2:43] servants even his
[2:46] disobedient
[2:48] Servants of which there must be some
[2:52] among
[2:54] us because if there's ever been a time
[2:56] in your life that you have not obeyed
[2:59] the Lord Lord you've been a disobedient
[3:02] servant and you can wallow around in
[3:05] your sorrow and in your and your
[3:08] discouragement and your condemnation or
[3:11] you can choose like a captive Daughter
[3:13] of Zion get
[3:15] up awake awake put on your strength o
[3:21] Zion Shake yourself from the dust so God
[3:27] is always joining himself to the
[3:29] struggles of even his disobedient
[3:31] servants it's the one it's one of the
[3:33] most comforting and encouraging pictures
[3:36] that we have of the care that God has
[3:39] for his children and we have it all the
[3:41] way through the Bible are you with me
[3:44] this is a message to tell you that God
[3:46] joined himself to you in your heartache
[3:49] in your sorrow in your pain in your loss
[3:52] in your mistake sir he joined himself to
[3:56] you in your backsliding in your lukewarm
[4:00] this sir when you grew cold he was still
[4:03] joined to you when you cared about him
[4:06] and when you didn't care about him he
[4:08] was still joined to you and he's got an
[4:11] appointment He's got an appointment for
[4:13] you at the house of God he's got an
[4:16] appointment for you at
[4:18] badeel he wants you to get down to the
[4:21] house of
[4:22] God remember you're the
[4:26] house he just wants you to acknowledge
[4:29] that you're his house and he wants you
[4:31] to corporately meet with
[4:33] Believers you'll never This Modern
[4:35] church will never ever ever ever
[4:38] convince me that being in church
[4:40] somewhere is not important
