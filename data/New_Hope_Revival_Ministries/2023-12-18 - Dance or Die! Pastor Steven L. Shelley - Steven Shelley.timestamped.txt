[43:12] help her in her time of need I know that
[43:15] Nathan needs a touch from the
[43:17] Lord would you pray for Autumn Trey and
[43:21] autumn autumn had oral surgery this week
[43:24] was not feeling good today and needs to
[43:26] be remembered to the Lord Tiffany has
[43:29] been suffering with extremely high blood
[43:32] pressure and uh even the medication if
[43:35] she was taking it is not uh she's not
[43:38] responding well to it and sister Teresa
[43:41] asked that you cover their family they
[43:42] have traveling to do and today to go
[43:45] back and forth and then a wedding coming
[43:47] up I think in in Missouri is that
[43:52] right okay all right you didn't have
[43:55] much of a choice Choice did you with all
[43:57] that you all are going through you know
[43:59] this uh situation brother gy mentioned
[44:01] with Jessica that that that's that's the
[44:04] kind of condition that takes people out
[44:06] yes it is so she is really a miracle to
[44:09] have survived perhaps her age is helping
[44:11] and prayer lots of prayer I'm sure but I
[44:14] know people I've I've known several
[44:16] people that lost their lives immediately
[44:18] well my grandfather died of a brain
[44:20] aneurysm but I know some that literally
[44:22] Dro dead and so God is good and their
[44:26] must be a reason and let's believe that
[44:28] God will deliver her and save her fill
[44:30] her with the Holy Ghost brother Terry
[44:32] Tidwell was in the hospital last night
[44:35] with a terrible infection and they were
[44:37] thinking that it might perhaps be sepsis
[44:40] and uh I would like for you to remember
[44:42] him and he reached out to me a few weeks
[44:44] ago with an unspoken request and I've
[44:46] been praying for him about that I
[44:50] understand that there was an awful
[44:51] tragedy today in the how of shell and
[44:55] and Hate
[44:56] family uh the loss of a son and I don't
[45:00] have enough details to want to call that
[45:03] out loud I don't even know if all the
[45:05] family has I don't know who knows who
[45:07] doesn't know but a tragic loss would you
[45:10] please pray for that family that God
[45:12] would undertake for them sister Kathy is
[45:15] not feeling well today with throat and
[45:18] ear issues so let's ask God to help her
[45:20] and I've got one more I had to write

[45:24] when I'm giving them to keep up with
[45:26] them but remember brother Dwayne and
[45:28] sister Heather she goes in what day goes
[45:31] in this coming Friday for them to take
[45:33] the little baby girl and let's thank God
[45:35] for bringing her through and we're just
[45:38] believing that everything is going to go
[45:40] smooth there is the possibility that she
[45:42] would go into labor before then I think
[45:45] that would be her preference but God has
[45:46] all this in his great big hands he does
[45:49] yes he does that's ask the Lord and the
[45:50] meetings begin in Kenya and I haven't
[45:53] said anything too much about them

[45:56] week before Thanksgiving that I wouldn't
[45:58] be able to come and there was real
[46:00] disappointment and even some hurt
[46:01] feelings would you ask the Lord to do so
[46:04] many amazing things in that meeting that
[46:07] they won't even care it won't even
[46:08] matter to them uh that that they'll just
[46:11] be so full of what God has for them that
[46:14] they'll forgive me yes amen let's take

[1:02:48] hallelujah oh you're wonderful and
[1:02:52] worthy woo you may be seated for a
[1:02:55] moment or two this morning we're blessed
[1:02:58] to be in the house of the Lord we've had
[1:03:01] a couple of cloudy days now but it
[1:03:03] doesn't have to be cloudy in here it can
[1:03:05] the sun is shining the s o n has risen
[1:03:09] in my heart and I've got so much to
[1:03:12] thank God for so much to praise him for
[1:03:16] if you can draw a good breath and and
[1:03:18] you have somehow so far navigated all
[1:03:22] the sickness around you
[1:03:24] and you're still doing well you've got
[1:03:26] something to be thankful for amen we
[1:03:30] didn't mention sister gird and sister
[1:03:32] Terry being out this morning I did
[1:03:34] forgot to write it down but sister gerd
[1:03:36] was not doing well earlier in the week
[1:03:39] and uh she had a positive test and has
[1:03:42] had a lot of congestion and so forth and
[1:03:45] so we want to believe God I mean I just
[1:03:47] believe I just believe it's done but we
[1:03:50] need it to manifest so that she can be
[1:03:52] free uh of course at her age it gives us
[1:03:56] more reason to pray and and uh to to be
[1:03:59] concerned only to the point of praying
[1:04:01] more right and also I heard uh through
[1:04:06] Joshua I think it was or Benjamin
[1:04:07] somebody mentioned that there was
[1:04:09] sickness at RJ and Emily's house so
[1:04:12] let's hold them up to the Lord in prayer
[1:04:14] and believe that they will quickly shake
[1:04:16] that off uh I I brother gy I get
[1:04:20] confused every time is Sister Louis's
[1:04:23] birthday before your just the day before
[1:04:25] yours or or is it not it was wrong on

[1:04:37] possibly be this week but uh there were
[1:04:40] a couple different things on Facebook
[1:04:42] and I have I've meant to find out and I
[1:04:44] and I haven't done it when I'm when I
[1:04:47] mention it when I see it then I think of
[1:04:49] it and other times it leaves my mind if
[1:04:52] by chance your birthday sister we is on
[1:04:55] Tuesday of this week happy birthday if
[1:04:58] it's not you get extra love and prayers
[1:05:01] anyway and then on Wednesday of this

[1:05:24] him and strengthen him and he shares a
[1:05:27] birthday with a friend of mine Caleb
[1:05:29] Deron and so I always pray for brother
[1:05:32] gy and Caleb on the day of their
[1:05:34] birthday and then Saturday of this
[1:05:36] coming week RJ has a birthday and we
[1:05:39] always like to pray for sister Rebecca's
[1:05:42] son Matthew his birthday is also on that
[1:05:45] day so let's lift him up to the Lord did
[1:05:48] I miss any birthdays or anniversaries
[1:05:50] this week all right so I know some
[1:05:53] people don't don't even want theirs
[1:05:55] called out but too bad if we remember
[1:05:59] we're going
[1:06:00] to sometimes we get carried away and we
[1:06:02] don't get a chance to do that we're glad
[1:06:05] that brother Josiah and sister Katie are
[1:06:07] still with us and uh we're looking
[1:06:10] forward to it we have some more visitors
[1:06:12] coming in in over the course of the next
[1:06:14] couple of weekends so let's let's uh
[1:06:17] protect ourselves from sickness and try
[1:06:19] to be here amen we believe that God has
[1:06:22] something for us uh I guess you know
[1:06:25] that this has been a really sad week in
[1:06:28] Israel an unspeakable tragedy has taken
[1:06:31] place and that three hostages were uh
[1:06:35] you know it's hard to say it it's hard
[1:06:37] to speak it out but they were
[1:06:39] accidentally killed and uh you know I
[1:06:42] can't call it Friendly Fire because
[1:06:45] there wasn't anything friendly about it
[1:06:47] it was just a terrible mistake and the
[1:06:50] Rules of Engagement were broken and it's
[1:06:53] easy to criticize when you're sitting in
[1:06:55] your uh easy chair at home but these
[1:06:59] young men have been drafted off the
[1:07:01] street with uh two years of training and
[1:07:05] and it takes a whole lot longer than
[1:07:07] that to make a skilled Soldier and uh so
[1:07:10] uh they they just really believed and
[1:07:13] and what makes it so complicated is when
[1:07:15] you're dealing with an enemy that has no
[1:07:17] morality at all uh hardly any any human
[1:07:21] instinct and they like to fool they
[1:07:24] dress up and in many of the bus bombings
[1:07:27] in Jerusalem the Palestinians have
[1:07:30] dressed up like religious Jews so they
[1:07:32] could get on the bus and blow it up and
[1:07:35] so uh they felt like that they were that
[1:07:38] they were trying to lure them in I think
[1:07:40] you heard the report last week that a
[1:07:42] four-year-old child was sent out into a
[1:07:44] field in the wee hours of the morning to
[1:07:47] lure the soldiers in and uh
[1:07:51] miraculously they were able to go and
[1:07:53] save save the little child without being
[1:07:55] killed but the purpose of sending the
[1:07:57] child out was to draw them in so that
[1:07:59] they could kill them all and uh
[1:08:02] something happened and they weren't able
[1:08:03] to make the attack and so you can't
[1:08:06] trust and so when these men came out
[1:08:09] without their shirts on uh it it
[1:08:12] appeared that that there was more to it
[1:08:14] than what was being said and of course
[1:08:17] according to the Rules of Engagement
[1:08:19] they should have not fired a shot but
[1:08:21] you're dealing again with all the nerves
[1:08:25] and with all of the stress and with all
[1:08:27] of the tension that's going around you
[1:08:29] and mistakes are made and uh it's an
[1:08:31] awful thing and of course the world is
[1:08:33] upside down about it um but that's just
[1:08:36] the way it works and uh I heard a
[1:08:39] commentator and this may sound like
[1:08:41] cursing and if it does you forgive me
[1:08:43] it's a famous quote but he's telling the
[1:08:46] truth he said war is hell and and if it
[1:08:49] sounds like I'm cursing well I I didn't
[1:08:51] mean to but I I whole heart edly agree
[1:08:55] that it's not good in any circumstances
[1:08:58] do we want war but we do believe that
[1:09:01] Israel like all other nations has a
[1:09:03] right to protect themselves and their
[1:09:06] children need to be protected and we are
[1:09:08] afraid that before o it's over that many
[1:09:11] more of the hostages will uh uh either
[1:09:14] lose their lives or we will come to know
[1:09:16] that they have lost their lives but we
[1:09:18] are still believing and praying for them
[1:09:20] every day and checking our list and
[1:09:22] believing that this thing will
[1:09:24] eventually be over and when it's over
[1:09:26] praying that there will be no more Hamas
[1:09:29] and the the situation in the north is
[1:09:31] getting worse and uh you know when when
[1:09:36] when Hezbollah if you think Hamas is
[1:09:38] well equipped uh Hamas as far as we know
[1:09:42] they have no cited missiles and what
[1:09:45] that means is they usually fire cam
[1:09:48] rockets and these Kasam Rockets are are
[1:09:52] uh are are not uh sight guided and so
[1:09:56] they just put them in the loader maybe
[1:09:58] you've seen the footage they put them in
[1:10:00] the loader the loader shoots them and
[1:10:02] wherever they land is where they it's
[1:10:03] where they land but we know for sure
[1:10:07] that Hezbollah in the north is much
[1:10:10] better equipped and we know that they
[1:10:12] have laser guided missiles with nuclear
[1:10:16] uh some
[1:10:17] warheads and uh this becomes a very
[1:10:20] serious situation in the north when when
[1:10:23] h
[1:10:24] can send a uh drone over yesterday into
[1:10:28] Northern Israel and kill a man with a
[1:10:30] drone uh a soldier then you realize that
[1:10:34] you're fighting a different kind of War
[1:10:35] than Israel has ever fought before and I
[1:10:38] maybe I am taking too much of your time
[1:10:41] but but this is this is something that
[1:10:43] we have a responsibility of course to
[1:10:45] pray for the Peace of Jerusalem and uh
[1:10:49] so that that's why we have no apology
[1:10:51] for saying let let it be accomplished
[1:10:54] all that needs to be accomplished for
[1:10:56] her to have peace one of these days
[1:10:58] there's going to be peace in the whole
[1:11:01] earth SAR Shalom is coming the Prince of
[1:11:04] Peace is coming until then it will be
[1:11:07] hit and miss but when he gets here oh
[1:11:10] Hallelujah I blocked a message preacher
[1:11:12] this week on on Facebook from Africa who
[1:11:15] was berating and uh belittling and uh
[1:11:18] and and acting like a wild man himself
[1:11:21] and I just thought you know what I don't
[1:11:23] have to argue with you uh if if this was
[1:11:26] happening in your nation it would be a
[1:11:28] different story all of us would
[1:11:30] certainly change our minds but God is a
[1:11:32] good God and he knows how to bring peace
[1:11:36] to this madness uh would you thank God
[1:11:39] for these musicians and we're so
[1:11:42] [Applause]
[1:11:45] blessed I hope you all will gather back
[1:11:47] with us as soon as you can seems like
[1:11:50] sometimes they they get a little carried
[1:11:52] away with their with with their break
[1:11:55] I'd like to see them in here because
[1:11:57] there's you can say
[1:11:59] Amen because there's nothing like
[1:12:01] sitting under the atmosphere of the
[1:12:03] word maybe I'm just jealous that I don't
[1:12:06] get a break halfway through the service
[1:12:08] but whatever let's stand let's see what
[1:12:11] God has I don't want to preach this
[1:12:14] morning but it's my responsibility to
[1:12:17] and any preacher will tell you that
[1:12:20] there are times when we want to and time
[1:12:23] s when we don't want
[1:12:27] to but when we don't want to we have to
[1:12:31] anyway and it's not uh not that it's a
[1:12:34] hard message it's an easy message but it
[1:12:37] just seems like we've covered it from
[1:12:40] every angle and I am so anxious to to
[1:12:44] move on to some other
[1:12:46] subjects but I really know I know that
[1:12:51] the Lord is is sort of making me do this
[1:12:53] again so I'm I'm I'm o I'm being
[1:12:56] obedient but I'm reluctantly obedient I
[1:12:59] know you don't have that problem I know
[1:13:02] that when God tells you to jump you ask
[1:13:04] how high on the way
[1:13:06] up but I don't always ask how high on
[1:13:09] the way up sometimes I have to ask how
[1:13:12] high and then jump but here we are
[1:13:16] second Samuel chapter
[1:13:19] 6 beginning in verse 13 and you know
[1:13:22] I'll just say this uh the worship this
[1:13:25] morning was good it could have been much
[1:13:27] more and and it it can be uh I I knew
[1:13:32] the problem I could sense the problem
[1:13:34] and feel the problem some of you you
[1:13:36] didn't mean to I know you didn't mean to
[1:13:38] bring your chaos with you this morning
[1:13:40] but you know we do and I could just
[1:13:43] sense that there had been some harsh
[1:13:45] words spoken to for you to get over here
[1:13:48] and uh you know that it's hard to
[1:13:51] recover and but you should
[1:13:53] because the Bible says enter into his
[1:13:56] gates with Thanksgiving in your heart
[1:13:58] into your courts with praise I'm not
[1:14:00] going to tell you it's been a long time
[1:14:02] it's been a long time but I'm not going
[1:14:05] to tell you that there hasn't been a
[1:14:06] time that I was mad at my wife or she
[1:14:08] was mad at me on a Sunday morning but I
[1:14:11] want you to know that I would just often
[1:14:13] say honey forgive me we will settle this
[1:14:17] but right now I've got to go to church
[1:14:19] and do what I'm called to do and we'll
[1:14:21] get it straightened out and don't you
[1:14:23] let it hinder you and I'm not going to
[1:14:25] let it hinder me that's the only way you
[1:14:27] can enter in everybody look this way
[1:14:31] that's the only way you can you got to
[1:14:33] settle that but now you've got to make
[1:14:34] up about it and you got to try to get it
[1:14:36] taken care of because some of you
[1:14:38] brought it with you this
[1:14:40] morning you don't want me to
[1:14:42] point I see some blushing faces don't
[1:14:46] bring it here get it straightened out
[1:14:48] and look it ain't worth it I don't care
[1:14:51] what it is it's not even worth worth
[1:14:54] it somebody said well we got to talk it
[1:14:56] out you know what I believe in that I
[1:14:59] believe in that but sometimes I don't
[1:15:00] even think that's really
[1:15:03] necessary I know women are going to have
[1:15:05] a hard time with me saying that but
[1:15:08] sometimes you just get over
[1:15:10] it for
[1:15:14] love
[1:15:16] amen and you just press on and of course
[1:15:20] you're rushing around I could really
[1:15:21] tell you a lot of things if you'd listen
[1:15:23] you go to bed too late on Saturday
[1:15:26] night your children are up way later
[1:15:29] than they need to be up and you won't
[1:15:32] listen you won't listen to me you say I
[1:15:35] think maybe in your mind you think
[1:15:36] that's none of my business well I'm only
[1:15:38] trying to help you you get up late you
[1:15:42] don't have an
[1:15:43] alarm if you do you live by a
[1:15:49] snooze you're just habitual snoozers
[1:15:52] come on now I didn't say losers I said
[1:15:55] snoozers and you get on up and you get
[1:15:59] out of bed and you provide a something
[1:16:01] for your family to eat so they're not
[1:16:03] starving to death at 2:00 when the
[1:16:06] preacher gets through maybe three
[1:16:09] today and and you have things L would
[1:16:12] you believe that you can even pick your
[1:16:14] outfit would this just blow your mind if
[1:16:16] I told
[1:16:18] you that it's possible to pick what
[1:16:20] you're going to wear the next day and
[1:16:22] lay it out
[1:16:24] lay it
[1:16:25] out so that you don't have to go around
[1:16:27] the house know where your keys are get
[1:16:29] you a basket W I'm on a
[1:16:32] roll get you a basket and put it by the
[1:16:34] front door or a nail when you come in
[1:16:37] the
[1:16:39] house when I come in the house my keys
[1:16:42] go right there then I don't have to look
[1:16:44] for them on Sunday morning nobody has to
[1:16:46] run through the house where are the
[1:16:48] keys all of that makes a difference when
[1:16:51] you get to God's house some of you have
[1:16:54] been here over 20 years and haven't
[1:16:56] learned a thing from
[1:16:57] [Music]
[1:16:59] me it's obvious but we went as high as
[1:17:03] we could with all that hanging on us and
[1:17:06] next time we'll go
[1:17:08] higher that's exactly right I I can't
[1:17:12] take it personal Benjamin can't take it
[1:17:14] personal musicians can't take it
[1:17:16] personal it is what it is but next time
[1:17:19] we vow we're going
[1:17:21] higher you if you have to reach over and
[1:17:24] give her a peck on the cheek or whatever
[1:17:26] you have to do to make it up so that you
[1:17:28] don't get intimidated to come and stand
[1:17:31] in your position 2 Samuel amen
[1:17:36] Pastor 2 Samuel chapter 6 beginning in
[1:17:40] verse 13 and it was so that when they
[1:17:44] that bear the Ark of the Lord these are
[1:17:47] the carriers of the glory god spoke to
[1:17:51] us here in this Church many years ago
[1:17:54] and said I've called you to be bearers
[1:17:57] carriers of my glory that means wherever
[1:18:00] we go we're to take the glory of his
[1:18:02] goodness with us as we were singing
[1:18:05] about this morning and when they that
[1:18:07] bear the Ark of the Lord had gone six
[1:18:10] Paces he sacrificed oxen and fatlings I
[1:18:15] don't know if you know this or not but
[1:18:16] that means every six
[1:18:21] paces then he offered to the Lord oxid
[1:18:25] and fatlings six
[1:18:28] paces oxid and fatlings so this was a
[1:18:32] ceremony yes sir sometimes people say
[1:18:35] you know you all get too it's too much
[1:18:37] of a thing turns out to be like a
[1:18:40] production well I want you to know this
[1:18:42] day was a day of of something that kind
[1:18:44] of looked like a
[1:18:46] production but it was all for the right
[1:18:49] reason and
[1:18:51] David
[1:18:58] danced didn't I just finish this nine
[1:19:00] Hebrew words of Praise yes sir didn't I
[1:19:03] just follow up on December 5th a Tuesday
[1:19:06] night uh follow up on Dancing yes sir
[1:19:09] well here I am
[1:19:11] again I can't help myself I have to obey
[1:19:14] him sir and David dance before the Lord
[1:19:19] with all his
[1:19:24] might everything he had in him he spent
[1:19:29] it with his praise and David was girded
[1:19:35] with a lenen
[1:19:37] EOD now that's not a whole lot of
[1:19:40] clothes so David and all the house of
[1:19:44] Israel brought up for the Ark of the
[1:19:48] Lord with
[1:19:51] shouting and with the sound
[1:19:54] of the trumpet help me out and as the
[1:19:59] Ark of the Lord came into the city of
[1:20:02] David Mel Saul's daughter looked through
[1:20:08] a
[1:20:09] window David's wife King Saul's daughter
[1:20:14] was looking through the casement and saw
[1:20:18] King
[1:20:20] David leaping
[1:20:24] and dancing before the
[1:20:27] Lord like sister
[1:20:30] Katie saw
[1:20:33] here she was just looking through the
[1:20:36] casement and oh she's over here wasn't
[1:20:37] she playing the piano she's just looking
[1:20:40] through the casement and all of a sudden
[1:20:43] it's like a
[1:20:44] spring boing
[1:20:48] boing it's right it's never hurt anybody
[1:20:52] unless you land on
[1:20:55] them leaping and dancing before the Lord
[1:21:00] and she not Katie Mel right despised him
[1:21:07] in her
[1:21:09] heart what a
[1:21:13] woman there's a reason for that father
[1:21:17] we have come today to worship your name
[1:21:21] to hallow your name in a wicked World
[1:21:25] our hearts grow heavy with the news we
[1:21:29] are caught up in the emotion of the
[1:21:32] struggles of our families and our
[1:21:35] neighbors around us we wear the
[1:21:39] tragedies and traumas of other people's
[1:21:42] lives and we must remember that when we
[1:21:45] come into your presence we have to it it
[1:21:49] it's a requirement that we lay all of
[1:21:52] that at the feet of King Jesus and we
[1:21:55] say Lord I can't sort all the details
[1:21:58] out right now I've got to praise I've
[1:22:01] got to worship I've got to come under
[1:22:03] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and
[1:22:06] while I'm under the inspiration of the
[1:22:08] Holy Spirit perhaps Lord you'll help me
[1:22:12] so that when I come out from under that
[1:22:14] inspiration I have wisdom and strategy
[1:22:17] and I have peace about how to make a
[1:22:20] decision for what's going on in our life
[1:22:22] lives father I don't believe that
[1:22:24] anybody suffers when they lay these
[1:22:27] things at your feet and come for a few
[1:22:29] hours and forget about it all I believe
[1:22:32] that instead of suffering I believe they
[1:22:34] gain I believe it's a great Victory when
[1:22:37] we're able to do that so if we failed
[1:22:40] this morning if some of us didn't quite
[1:22:42] pass that test I pray that you will
[1:22:45] strengthen each one in the name of the
[1:22:48] Lord Jesus Christ don't let anybody
[1:22:51] leave here with the attitude well I
[1:22:53] guess I could have just stayed at home
[1:22:55] for doing such a thing as that is
[1:22:58] breaking the word of God we don't want
[1:23:00] to do that either we want to press
[1:23:03] through all of the doubt and all of the
[1:23:06] struggle and we want to come and praise
[1:23:09] you with all of our might with all of
[1:23:11] our strength because you are more than
[1:23:14] wonderful you are more than worthy help
[1:23:16] us now in our time in the word and we
[1:23:19] will give you the glory and the honor
[1:23:21] and the praise for it's in the name of
[1:23:24] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the
[1:23:27] church said you may be seated isn't he
[1:23:30] good he's
[1:23:35] good I don't know charity if you if you
[1:23:39] did all those separate or if they're all
[1:23:41] together those Hebrew words are they all
[1:23:43] together they're separate all right so
[1:23:46] we're going to go over four Hebrew words
[1:23:50] that have just appeared in these three
[1:23:54] verses the Bible said first in verse 14
[1:23:59] and David danced before the Lord with
[1:24:03] all his
[1:24:06] might and the word for might there is
[1:24:10] O and it's spelled in English
[1:24:14] transliteration it's spelled o but it's
[1:24:17] pronounced oo and it means strength and
[1:24:23] might it can even mean power and stamina
[1:24:28] with everything that was within him I
[1:24:31] want you to know that if you're going to
[1:24:33] do something for
[1:24:35] God you ought to do your very best if
[1:24:39] you're going to vacuum the floor for God
[1:24:42] you ought to vacuum it with
[1:24:44] perfection anything we do as unto the
[1:24:47] Lord we do it with everything that we
[1:24:50] have there's no ha halfway praise there
[1:24:54] there's no you know I'll just give it my
[1:24:56] best shot no no no your best you know th
[1:25:01] this whole concept they used to sing a
[1:25:03] song in Pentecostal churches that oh
[1:25:06] just praise the Lord anyhow Just Praise
[1:25:09] the Lord anyhow you know I don't even
[1:25:11] like that I've told you before I
[1:25:14] understand the concept in everything
[1:25:16] give thanks but it's not an old anyhow
[1:25:19] praise or I'll just you know praise him
[1:25:22] anyhow praise him anyway no no no praise
[1:25:25] is a serious serious
[1:25:28] exchange it's a serious occupation I am
[1:25:32] a professional praiser I want you to
[1:25:35] know I'm called to be a praiser I'm
[1:25:37] called to be a worshipper I was created
[1:25:40] for such a purpose as that and so you
[1:25:43] may have as part of your destiny success
[1:25:46] in business and you may have as part of
[1:25:49] your destiny to be a teacher to impart
[1:25:51] knowledge know and wisdom and you may
[1:25:54] have as part of your destiny the calling
[1:25:56] to be a parent but there is no
[1:25:59] calling that's any higher on your life
[1:26:03] or any destiny that is any higher on
[1:26:05] your life than that that you were
[1:26:08] created to worship and to praise the
[1:26:11] Lord and maybe we get weary with hearing
[1:26:14] it but I find that it's something that
[1:26:16] we have to be prompted on and reminded
[1:26:19] of because sometimes we think that it's
[1:26:22] better
[1:26:22] on our emotions or how we're handling a
[1:26:25] present situation but I want you to know
[1:26:28] that's not the way we do it at all when
[1:26:30] we lose we praise when we win we
[1:26:35] praise when we're on top of it all we
[1:26:38] praise when we feel like it's all on top
[1:26:41] of us we praise because it's who we were
[1:26:45] created to be you may not realize it but
[1:26:48] that kind of Praise brings you into a
[1:26:51] flow
[1:26:52] of
[1:26:53] obedience a praiser a worshiper is more
[1:26:57] likely to
[1:26:59] obey when God speaks to them because
[1:27:03] praise keeps the channels open and it
[1:27:07] keeps the communication between you and
[1:27:09] your creator flowing and it gives you
[1:27:12] Grace to speak to him and it also
[1:27:14] releases Grace for you to be able to
[1:27:16] hear him because he's always talking
[1:27:19] that's right can I say that again he's
[1:27:22] always
[1:27:25] talking you know sometimes we think
[1:27:27] about when God is silent we get this
[1:27:31] idea from Jon ofar God is silent these
[1:27:34] voices that once guided me that once
[1:27:37] spoke to me I can't hear them and when I
[1:27:40] needed God he was silent I don't really
[1:27:44] believe that that is the case what I
[1:27:46] believe is that God doesn't always speak
[1:27:49] to us the same
[1:27:50] way but he's is always
[1:27:54] talking it's one of the reasons why we
[1:27:57] need to hear the
[1:27:58] messages that make up the message of the
[1:28:01] hour the sermons that have been recorded
[1:28:05] and preserved for us and reserved on our
[1:28:08] behalf as spiritual food in due season I
[1:28:12] don't understand how anybody could feel
[1:28:15] a part of the bride of Christ that
[1:28:17] doesn't hear that voice that doesn't
[1:28:20] hear those sermons through through the
[1:28:22] week because it's what strengthens
[1:28:26] us and it it enhances us and it
[1:28:30] supplements us your pastor can't give
[1:28:33] you everything you need the fivefold
[1:28:36] ministry can't always provide for all of
[1:28:39] your needs and so we have the messages
[1:28:42] that God gave brother brandham and we
[1:28:44] say that without
[1:28:47] apology to sustain us to feed us to
[1:28:51] guide us to to direct us if you can
[1:28:54] listen to brother brandom preaching and
[1:28:56] not hunger for the
[1:28:58] word if you can listen to him and think
[1:29:01] that he is the one deserving the
[1:29:04] preeminence you haven't really listened
[1:29:06] to him because on every tape he's
[1:29:09] lifting up
[1:29:11] one and telling us that the word is our
[1:29:15] life the word is our
[1:29:17] foundation amen we can't live on our
[1:29:20] worship we not changed by our worship
[1:29:24] but our worship helps position us to
[1:29:28] receive the word that will then change
[1:29:31] our lives I've Been Changed by the word
[1:29:34] of God I want to testify to you the word
[1:29:37] of God has changed my life not once but
[1:29:41] again and again and again and again so
[1:29:45] whatever you do for God do it with all
[1:29:47] your
[1:29:49] sweat put all the Sweat Equity you in
[1:29:52] and listen I want you to know that there
[1:29:55] is an expectation in the world to
[1:29:58] respond a certain way to everything that
[1:30:01] happens when your loved ones die you're
[1:30:04] supposed to to uh to look
[1:30:11] sick and walk
[1:30:16] funny I don't know what that has to do
[1:30:18] with
[1:30:19] death and uh not smile not look anyone
[1:30:24] in the eye I'm not making light of
[1:30:27] grief what I'm telling you is we should
[1:30:30] not be living by the expectations of
[1:30:32] those who don't have the faith that we
[1:30:34] have don't you let them tell you how to
[1:30:39] grieve don't you let the world's
[1:30:41] expectations tell you how to respond am
[1:30:44] let the word of God tell you how to
[1:30:46] respond we respond in
[1:30:50] Praise the Lord is given the Lord is
[1:30:53] taken away does it mean it doesn't hurt
[1:30:57] no it hurts it's like a rip it's like a
[1:31:00] rip in our heart it's more than we can
[1:31:03] stand in the natural and that's why
[1:31:06] we've got to get in the
[1:31:09] spirit let me have a little water while
[1:31:11] you see
[1:31:16] law if we get in the spirit we can be
[1:31:20] lifted above our human real
[1:31:22] action and we can respond Spirit to
[1:31:27] Spirit and we need to we must this
[1:31:31] little brother who lost his wife to
[1:31:33] breast cancer after a couple year battle
[1:31:37] when he was here just a few weeks ago
[1:31:39] and when I greeted him for the first
[1:31:41] time in the line on Saturday for lunch
[1:31:44] he said I feel like I ought to know you
[1:31:46] brother because of all the services
[1:31:49] we've streamed I feel like I ought to
[1:31:51] know you but now it's my first time uh
[1:31:53] meeting you and I and I said to him what
[1:31:56] we englishes would say to one another I
[1:31:59] said I'm very sorry for your loss and he
[1:32:02] looked at me like I I don't know if
[1:32:04] you're going to be able to take what I'm
[1:32:06] about to say or not and so I just looked
[1:32:09] deep in his eye and he said don't don't
[1:32:12] be sorry he said you brother you don't
[1:32:14] have to say that to me don't be sorry he
[1:32:17] said I don't know if you can understand
[1:32:19] this or not but he said I what I mean
[1:32:22] and really because you don't know me but
[1:32:24] he said I I I I have
[1:32:27] peace I grieved while she was suffering
[1:32:31] but when she was
[1:32:33] released he said I decided to
[1:32:37] Rejoice to give God praise and to raise
[1:32:40] my
[1:32:41] family what more could he do what more
[1:32:45] should a Believer do it doesn't mean
[1:32:48] that we don't go losing jobs you know
[1:32:51] I've known of people losing a job and
[1:32:54] and uh going into the throws of
[1:32:56] depression and needing medication and
[1:32:59] and constant counseling and and I'm I'm
[1:33:02] not surprised when people respond that
[1:33:05] way out there but a
[1:33:07] Believer a believer I'm preaching to
[1:33:10] Believers today we don't grieve like
[1:33:14] those who have no hope we know that if
[1:33:17] God takes this job he's got another one
[1:33:20] waiting on us
[1:33:22] somewhere and in the interim we know we
[1:33:25] won't
[1:33:26] hunger he'll Feed Us it might not be our
[1:33:30] favorites but it will be enough to
[1:33:33] sustain us until God makes another Grace
[1:33:36] deposit in our account if you know what
[1:33:39] I'm saying this morning say amen amen am
[1:33:42] I real crooked sir good cuz it's really
[1:33:45] getting on my nerves no I'm trying to
[1:33:48] leave it
[1:33:48] [Music]
[1:33:50] on
[1:33:55] David he danced before the Lord with all
[1:33:59] of his
[1:34:00] strength with all of his might it goes
[1:34:04] on to say uh David and all the house of
[1:34:07] Israel verse 15 brought up the Ark of
[1:34:10] the Lord with
[1:34:13] shouting so that word shouting there is
[1:34:18] tra and and and it's spelled uh t e r u
[1:34:24] a h tra and it is a word that
[1:34:31] describes the
[1:34:32] sounding the the uh the Cadence the
[1:34:38] Cadence of the
[1:34:41] trumpet there are several three
[1:34:44] different words I think in Hebrew that
[1:34:46] describe the
[1:34:48] sounds that are made on the chaar
[1:34:52] and one of them
[1:34:57] is and one of them is
[1:35:02] two amazing you didn't know I made such
[1:35:05] a good Rams Horn do you and the other
[1:35:11] one and all of them needed a
[1:35:14] word because Hebrew is one of the most
[1:35:17] poetic and picturesque uh languages in
[1:35:21] the history of the world so this this
[1:35:25] tra is is a word that that sort of gives
[1:35:29] the impression of oh oh oh oh oh oh
[1:35:34] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:35:37] hallelujah you know the kind of Praise
[1:35:39] that gets on your
[1:35:44] nerves did you know that that it's easy
[1:35:48] to miss if you never look at what what
[1:35:51] word is used which word is being used
[1:35:54] for shouting then then you might not
[1:35:56] know that there was a specific word
[1:35:59] chosen based on the kind of shouting
[1:36:02] that was going
[1:36:04] on so hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:36:09] hallelujah like I said the kind that'll
[1:36:11] get on your
[1:36:12] nerves but God must like it right
[1:36:16] because he he gave us a word to describe
[1:36:19] that kind of of
[1:36:22] shouting a shout or a blast of War an
[1:36:27] alarm or Joy it can be
[1:36:32] celebratory or it can be an alarm to
[1:36:35] call to action and its last definition
[1:36:38] there is a
[1:36:40] battlecry one that says God is giving us
[1:36:44] the victory he has he
[1:36:48] is and he always will that's right are
[1:36:51] you with me and then it says and with
[1:36:55] the sound of a trumpet the reason why it
[1:36:58] mentioned that two different words here
[1:37:01] expressed in two different ways is
[1:37:04] because the sound of the shouting was so
[1:37:07] similar to the sound of the trumpet or
[1:37:10] the chofar that the riter wanted to make
[1:37:13] sure we understood there was a voice
[1:37:15] that was doing it and there was an
[1:37:18] instrument that was doing it do you
[1:37:20] follow that
[1:37:22] and and then it goes on to say King
[1:37:25] David was
[1:37:28] leaping and
[1:37:30] dancing before the Lord that word
[1:37:34] leaping is
[1:37:36] Paz
[1:37:38] Paz and it means to
[1:37:41] bound are you with me still
[1:37:45] hello don't you say you are get there
[1:37:49] when it says to bound it does doesn't
[1:37:51] mean to be
[1:37:52] bound it doesn't mean to be binding it
[1:37:56] means to
[1:37:57] bound
[1:38:00] wow some of you who have a lot less to
[1:38:03] lift than
[1:38:04] I can really get up there but it means
[1:38:09] like a
[1:38:10] spring to bound and to
[1:38:14] rebound it means to be
[1:38:17] Supple or
[1:38:19] agile or nimble
[1:38:22] oh David was he was giving it everything
[1:38:26] he had he was shouting while the
[1:38:30] trumpets were being blown and he was
[1:38:33] leaping around as agile as a deer right
[1:38:38] and then it says dancing and the word
[1:38:40] dancing there is
[1:38:42] corer ker and it mean it's only used two
[1:38:47] times and it means to whirl about did
[1:38:51] you notice as we taught a few weeks ago
[1:38:54] that almost every word that dancing is
[1:38:57] or every word that is translated in
[1:38:59] English is dancing almost every one of
[1:39:02] them speaks of a circular type
[1:39:05] whirl to whirr about to dance to move
[1:39:09] around to then surround to enclose see
[1:39:13] again you've got the circular to
[1:39:16] recur like turning a
[1:39:19] mill or this kind of meal that's
[1:39:24] turning this is what David was doing you
[1:39:28] can call it not sacred you can call it
[1:39:32] disrespectful you can call it not
[1:39:34] according to church order somebody said
[1:39:37] wait a minute brother they weren't in
[1:39:38] church oh yes they
[1:39:41] were they weren't in a building but
[1:39:44] remember every six Paces come
[1:39:48] on every six paces they they worship by
[1:39:53] giving a slain offering now anywhere
[1:39:56] you're giving offerings to God if you
[1:39:58] know anything about the order of the Old
[1:40:00] Testament it's called a tabernacle or a
[1:40:02] temple or a place that God
[1:40:05] dwells you can't just do this in your
[1:40:07] own home they were not allowed to give
[1:40:10] sacrificial offerings like that slaying
[1:40:12] animals shedding blood in their own
[1:40:16] homes it always took place in the
[1:40:18] Tabernacle or in the temple yes sir so
[1:40:22] this was not the Tabernacle the mishon
[1:40:25] in the wilderness this was not the
[1:40:27] Temple of Solomon but what it was is it
[1:40:31] it was a temporary place of worship as
[1:40:34] David was bringing the ark yes back to
[1:40:37] where it belonged to be it was a move
[1:40:40] hear me now I don't want to bore you on
[1:40:43] he hear me they were moving in
[1:40:45] restoration am amen I'm telling you
[1:40:48] God's moving today yes he is and he's
[1:40:51] doing it in
[1:40:52] restoration because so much has been
[1:40:55] lost now just just for the record here I
[1:40:59] am studying this week since Friday I am
[1:41:05] studying the things that brother
[1:41:07] brandham said about the
[1:41:11] shook
[1:41:13] because I I I appreciate that I
[1:41:16] appreciate what he said you can find the
[1:41:20] the um majority of that in the sermon
[1:41:23] the seed shall not be air with the Shu
[1:41:27] but he mentions that Shu or shock
[1:41:31] several times many times actually and
[1:41:35] it's so funny to me because when I hear
[1:41:37] people referring to the Shu it's always
[1:41:41] with a little twist of the
[1:41:47] lip and a little
[1:41:49] disdain come on but I wonder if they
[1:41:53] remember that that's what he said about
[1:41:57] Mary now let me tell you what the I I
[1:42:00] can't preach this this
[1:42:01] morning but my mind is on it blessed art
[1:42:05] thou among
[1:42:06] women blessed is the fruit of thy womb
[1:42:09] Jesus you're a pretty special gal highly
[1:42:13] favored and chosen of the Lord and so I
[1:42:16] don't believe that brother brandham
[1:42:18] would have referred to her as the
[1:42:20] carrier or the shook of the seed if it
[1:42:23] was always to be taken in such a
[1:42:26] Negative
[1:42:27] form remember he said the shook didn't
[1:42:30] have the life but the shook
[1:42:33] carried the life all right so when we
[1:42:36] hear brother Brandon referring to to
[1:42:39] Pentecostal as a shook every time so far
[1:42:44] that I have found he's speaking and even
[1:42:47] clarifies either three or four
[1:42:50] paragraphs before or three or four
[1:42:52] paragraphs after he he clarifies that
[1:42:55] he's talking about denominational
[1:42:57] Pentecostals right I can't find
[1:43:02] anywhere where he's calling the sh
[1:43:05] Pentecostal shook as the experience
[1:43:09] because if I remember correctly brother
[1:43:11] brandom is talking about the birth and
[1:43:13] he said every birth is a mess and every
[1:43:16] birth comes with three issues yes sir
[1:43:20] water blood and life and I believe he
[1:43:23] typed the Holy Ghost to the
[1:43:26] life so when I hear him talking about
[1:43:30] the Shu and Pentecostal I understand he
[1:43:33] he's saying things like they went to
[1:43:36] shook or or to to what was the other
[1:43:39] word seed which is not a proper word for
[1:43:42] for the explanation that he was giving
[1:43:44] on
[1:43:46] tongues now if you take that out of
[1:43:48] context you can preach as I've heard
[1:43:51] people recently preach that tongues is
[1:43:55] just Pentecostal
[1:43:57] shook but that's very much out of
[1:44:01] context so you know it's not always so
[1:44:04] good I remember the Brethren telling me
[1:44:06] 30 years ago we're not sure if this
[1:44:09] computer business is going to be good
[1:44:12] for the bride or
[1:44:13] not can you imagine being so old that I
[1:44:17] remember the first computer that the
[1:44:20] message was
[1:44:21] on and nobody really realized you could
[1:44:24] buy a computer and have it on there
[1:44:25] because uh you know brother Neil wasn't
[1:44:27] really selling them that way back then
[1:44:31] he was selling them with the message
[1:44:32] loaded on them already so he and he
[1:44:35] deserved it if you think I'm uh saying
[1:44:38] anything negative I am not he deserved
[1:44:42] it for all the work that he had put in
[1:44:45] to creating folio views that's what it
[1:44:47] was that was the software that was being
[1:44:49] used in that day but and I bought one in
[1:44:53] fact I had several and I went through
[1:44:56] all the
[1:44:57] stages I had the Sony
[1:45:00] ebook anybody have a Sony ebook when
[1:45:03] that came out and I even had a thermal
[1:45:06] printer so I had traveled all my years
[1:45:10] of ministry I had traveled Chad I'll
[1:45:13] tell you he toted it enough with a fulls
[1:45:16] size not fulls size like like ours up
[1:45:19] there but but a but a full-size paper
[1:45:22] printer so I had a laptop and a printer
[1:45:25] that was like that that I took
[1:45:27] everywhere I went in the world well when
[1:45:29] that ebook came out we didn't always
[1:45:32] have to have the laptop anymore and we
[1:45:34] didn't have to have a full-size printer
[1:45:36] because they made a little printer about
[1:45:38] that
[1:45:39] big and we could print the quotations
[1:45:41] out on thermal paper like a adding
[1:45:44] machine so imagine
[1:45:47] us oh I wish I had a picture
[1:45:51] standing somewhere in the third
[1:45:53] world remember just be on a
[1:45:57] roll can you imagine doing like that to
[1:45:59] try to find the quote you were looking
[1:46:00] for because you printed out more than
[1:46:02] you needed and you're trying to find it
[1:46:04] the Brethren back then said I don't know
[1:46:07] if this is going to be our our
[1:46:11] Glory or if it's going to be our
[1:46:15] death and I didn't understand what they
[1:46:18] meant I was so thrilled to have it as a
[1:46:21] resource to be able to search everything
[1:46:24] he said about a particular subject and
[1:46:26] to do it in a very relatively quick
[1:46:28] manner stay with me how many times will
[1:46:32] I need to say that today before we're
[1:46:34] done I hope not too many more and so uh
[1:46:40] I didn't understand what they meant I
[1:46:42] was so thankful for technology and so
[1:46:44] forth and uh and they said you see if if
[1:46:49] you are doing doing queries that's what
[1:46:51] they called them on folio views if
[1:46:53] you're doing a query it will only pull
[1:46:56] up the paragraph with that word in
[1:46:59] it and so if preachers start basing
[1:47:03] their supplemental
[1:47:05] quotes on one
[1:47:07] paragraph we see the
[1:47:11] potential you know I thought they were
[1:47:13] being
[1:47:15] legal I honestly thought they were being
[1:47:17] kind of brandom
[1:47:19] itish but they had a lot of wisdom that
[1:47:22] I didn't have they said I'm afraid that
[1:47:25] they will just read the paragraph where
[1:47:28] the word showed up and not the
[1:47:30] paragraphs before and the paragraphs
[1:47:32] after and if you're not careful you will
[1:47:35] present something as whole truth when
[1:47:38] it's only part truth can you follow me
[1:47:41] and so that's what's happening about
[1:47:43] those those shook quote tongues just
[1:47:46] Pentecostal
[1:47:48] Shook and when he when and I show you it
[1:47:50] I I'm working on it and I'll show it to
[1:47:52] you when when he when he says that he's
[1:47:56] talking in context if you go a few
[1:47:58] paragraphs before or after he's talking
[1:48:01] about when the doctrine became that
[1:48:04] speaking in tongues is the initial
[1:48:06] evidence of the Holy Ghost he said then
[1:48:09] it went to
[1:48:10] shook but here's what are you listening
[1:48:13] I'll call I know your names on brother
[1:48:17] there's nothing more important
[1:48:20] in your papers there than what I'm
[1:48:23] saying right
[1:48:26] now very
[1:48:28] important because where Pentecost made
[1:48:30] their mistake is when they took
[1:48:33] tongues and they made it the initial
[1:48:36] evidence of the Holy Ghost so the
[1:48:39] doctrine of tongues being the initial
[1:48:41] evidence of the Holy Ghost that was just
[1:48:45] shook the seed went on brother BR said
[1:48:49] you get a magnifi find glass and go down
[1:48:51] you'll find a little you'll find a
[1:48:52] little blade of Life coming coming out
[1:48:54] of there down there Bottom by by the
[1:48:56] bottom where the Shu comes into the to
[1:48:58] the ear you'll find a little Life coming
[1:49:00] up through there he said that's the seed
[1:49:02] that represents the germ life this other
[1:49:05] has been to protect and to keep so for
[1:49:07] preachers to stand up today and tell us
[1:49:10] that Pentecost is just a
[1:49:12] shook as though it's easy to snatch off
[1:49:14] the corn and throw away you forget what
[1:49:17] he said he said though the Shu had no
[1:49:19] life the life life came through the
[1:49:23] Shu now why is that an important uh uh
[1:49:27] observation because the Holy Ghost is
[1:49:31] life everything the Holy Ghost does is
[1:49:34] life
[1:49:36] producing there's no death in the Holy
[1:49:39] Ghost there's no death in a Pentecostal
[1:49:43] experience there may be death in taking
[1:49:46] a Doctrine to a Shu there may be death
[1:49:50] been making some little part of the
[1:49:52] picture the least of the gifts he said
[1:49:55] there may be some problem if we if we
[1:49:58] take that as though we have reached the
[1:50:00] Pinnacle this is why brother Brandon was
[1:50:02] so against the Pentecostal movement in
[1:50:05] those latter days is because they said
[1:50:07] this is this is it we talk in tongues we
[1:50:11] have reached the highest point and
[1:50:14] brother brandom said oh no woo there's
[1:50:16] so much more out there for us are you me
[1:50:21] there's so much more out there for us so
[1:50:25] let me get off of the sermon I'm not
[1:50:27] preaching and get on the one I am
[1:50:30] preaching and let's move
[1:50:35] on David was not going to get it wrong
[1:50:40] again he'd already been through some
[1:50:43] things he'd already changed the way the
[1:50:45] glory was
[1:50:46] carried it was to be carried on the on
[1:50:50] the
[1:50:51] shoulders near the heart of the
[1:50:54] levitical priesthood David said I I see
[1:50:58] it being such a hard task and so he
[1:51:01] wanted to design a new
[1:51:04] cart that he could put the Ark on that
[1:51:08] would make it a little easier to be
[1:51:12] stabilized and if you remember it it
[1:51:16] worked but not
[1:51:18] entirely because the heart would shake
[1:51:22] and the Ark would shake and the
[1:51:25] Commandment to the Levites was don't
[1:51:27] touch the ark you can move it by the
[1:51:31] Rings you can move it by the staves but
[1:51:34] don't put your hand on the ark I'm
[1:51:36] telling you amen I'm telling you brother
[1:51:40] sister be careful how you put your hand
[1:51:43] on the glory be careful how you put your
[1:51:45] hand on the Pentecostal
[1:51:48] experience be careful how you put your
[1:51:50] hand on somebody else's spiritual
[1:51:52] worship be careful because usza reached
[1:51:56] his hand to balance the ark and God
[1:51:58] smote him dead and David carried the
[1:52:02] guilt David was under the conviction and
[1:52:05] condemnation of the death of usza the
[1:52:08] priest because God said I'm showing you
[1:52:12] that my way is the best way my way is
[1:52:15] the right way my way is the only way
[1:52:18] does anybody hear God say that today I
[1:52:20] do my way is the right way so David was
[1:52:24] going to he wasn't going to get it wrong
[1:52:26] again he wanted to do everything
[1:52:28] according to God's order and protocol
[1:52:31] would you give me verses 9 and 10 of 2
[1:52:34] Samuel I've got to
[1:52:36] hurry and David was afraid of the Lord
[1:52:39] that day and said how shall the Ark of
[1:52:43] the Lord come to me so David would not
[1:52:47] remove the Ark of the Lord unto him into
[1:52:51] the city of David but David carried it
[1:52:54] aside into the house of Obed Edom the
[1:52:59] GTE now I mention to you that I have
[1:53:03] stood on the ruins of the House of OED
[1:53:08] Edom why because how do you know how
[1:53:11] could you possibly know that because it
[1:53:14] has been preserved from generation to
[1:53:16] generation to generation there have been
[1:53:19] several Church is built including one
[1:53:22] Byzantine massive church was built on
[1:53:25] the site now now in Ruins but another
[1:53:28] church sits there and it's such a
[1:53:30] popular place the Acoustics are so
[1:53:33] beautiful in the church over the H ruins
[1:53:36] of the House of OED Edom that Jewish
[1:53:39] people come from everywhere to a church
[1:53:42] which is not something that Jews
[1:53:44] generally do to hear the music
[1:53:47] concerts because the concerts that that
[1:53:49] are given there in in a church that's
[1:53:52] quite old it's not the first not the
[1:53:54] original but it's a church that's quite
[1:53:56] old the concerts are so amazing and I
[1:53:59] mentioned to you that the area the city
[1:54:01] the town is called kirat yarim and it's
[1:54:04] an Israeli Arab town and you can stand
[1:54:08] on top of kirat yarim of course you can
[1:54:11] go right down into the little village of
[1:54:13] abago and you can have the most
[1:54:15] wonderful food you've ever tasted in
[1:54:18] your life let's not forget the food in
[1:54:23] abago amazing Chad do you
[1:54:26] remember it is
[1:54:28] amazing the most wonderful upside
[1:54:32] down dumped right out on your table the
[1:54:35] most wonderful meal and you can look
[1:54:38] right down over the restaurant but but
[1:54:39] we're being spiritual now food is very
[1:54:42] spiritual but not in the moment and
[1:54:45] you're looking over to the city of
[1:54:46] Jerusalem and you're thinking about the
[1:54:49] the the
[1:54:50] the conflict that's in David's mind I
[1:54:54] want to take it all the way but I didn't
[1:54:57] have so so good a
[1:54:59] success so I'm going to put it over here
[1:55:02] into the house of OED Edom and I'm going
[1:55:05] to let him watch over the ark but there
[1:55:08] came a time that David was stirred Again
[1:55:13] by the spirit of the Lord to get the ark
[1:55:16] where it really belonged back to the
[1:55:19] city of Jerusalem what stirred
[1:55:25] him he began to
[1:55:28] hear that wherever that Ark was the
[1:55:31] blessings of God were where the freedom
[1:55:35] of the holy spirit is the blessings of
[1:55:38] God are poured out where God is free to
[1:55:42] move to talk and to have his way that's
[1:55:45] where I want to be I want to be right
[1:55:48] there in the middle of that I don't want
[1:55:49] want to spend my life sitting somewhere
[1:55:52] where Jesus has been banished to the
[1:55:54] corner with dirty feet I'm not going to
[1:55:57] live my life in a lifeless church I'm
[1:56:01] not going to live my life in a place
[1:56:03] where the Holy Ghost is not free to move
[1:56:07] too late too
[1:56:08] late he filled me with the Holy Ghost
[1:56:11] when I was seven years old I am too
[1:56:14] spoiled by the Holy Ghost to be able to
[1:56:16] live my life in a place where there is
[1:56:19] more structure than
[1:56:23] anointing I'm not opposed to God's order
[1:56:26] it's man's order that troubles my spirit
[1:56:30] anybody with me cuz if man is not
[1:56:33] working in tandem with God right he may
[1:56:36] find himself touching what does not
[1:56:38] belong to him to touch and he may find
[1:56:41] himself on the
[1:56:42] ground or pushing up lies in the in the
[1:56:45] cemetery you just don't ever know I
[1:56:47] don't want to touch that all this was a
[1:56:50] strong indication to David that God's
[1:56:53] anger had begin to subside and quiet
[1:56:55] down and he said you know it might be
[1:56:57] about time for me to move that Ark a
[1:56:59] little closer because the Bible tells us
[1:57:02] that David pitched a tent for the ark to
[1:57:05] sit in it was called The Tabernacle of
[1:57:08] David it's referenced several times in
[1:57:10] the Bible in fact the Bible prophesies
[1:57:12] that in those last days I will rebuild
[1:57:15] the Tabernacle of David and the main
[1:57:17] difference there were several
[1:57:18] differences but the main difference hear
[1:57:20] this between the Tabernacle of Moses and
[1:57:23] the Tabernacle of David is the
[1:57:25] Tabernacle of David had no
[1:57:28] Veil so the worshipper was not banished
[1:57:31] to the outer Court the worshipper could
[1:57:33] come right up if he had Clean Hands in a
[1:57:35] pure heart he could come right up into
[1:57:38] the presence of God and worship before
[1:57:40] the Ark of the Covenant come on no Veil
[1:57:43] to keep him out that was a that was a
[1:57:45] pre- shadow of what would happen with
[1:57:47] Christ when when he died on the cross
[1:57:50] and the veil of the temple was rent from
[1:57:52] top to bottom what David had what David
[1:57:54] was operating in what David was
[1:57:57] administering on the on the uh on Mount
[1:58:00] Zion was a was a pre-type of what you
[1:58:02] and I can experience with the baptism of
[1:58:04] the Holy Ghost so this was really in the
[1:58:07] heart of David to get that to get that
[1:58:10] Ark back to to the city of Jerusalem
[1:58:14] specifically to the city of David which
[1:58:16] is the same as Mount Zion and he thought
[1:58:19] you know if God is really blessing Obed
[1:58:21] Edom and there seems to be you know
[1:58:24] maybe the temperature maybe you know
[1:58:26] he's checking the temperature
[1:58:27] spiritually and he said I think God is
[1:58:30] is no longer angry with me for what I've
[1:58:32] done he said I may just I may just get
[1:58:34] see if I can get that Arc put back to
[1:58:37] where it belongs and David wanted to do
[1:58:39] it with such protocol he wanted to do it
[1:58:41] with such order he'd already messed up
[1:58:44] really really really really bad and so
[1:58:47] David wanted it to be sacred and he
[1:58:49] wanted wanted it to be holy and he
[1:58:50] wanted to be
[1:58:54] stiff cuz he didn't want to end up like
[1:58:57] usza but something happened to
[1:59:00] David he didn't set out to turn this
[1:59:03] into a holy ghost
[1:59:04] meeting oh he lined up those that would
[1:59:07] help do the
[1:59:08] sacrifices he lined up those that would
[1:59:11] chant the Psalms he lined up those that
[1:59:13] would help move things along every six
[1:59:16] Paces he had it all figured out and was
[1:59:19] going to make the most beautiful parade
[1:59:21] that Jerusalem had ever seen but he
[1:59:24] wasn't counting on that joy that was
[1:59:26] about to fill him from the top of his
[1:59:29] head to the souls of his feet and what
[1:59:31] ended up happening is David became
[1:59:33] overwhelmed with the
[1:59:35] joy of seeing the ark lifted up and
[1:59:39] returning to
[1:59:41] Jerusalem after all of these years back
[1:59:44] to where it belonged to be and so he
[1:59:47] forgot about protocol he forgot about s
[1:59:50] cimity he forgot about sacredness and he
[1:59:53] was overwhelmed with his joy and he
[1:59:55] began to
[1:59:58] LEAP right and dance with all his
[2:00:04] might I didn't hear David say this but
[2:00:07] I've got a feeling the joy was so
[2:00:09] powerful on him that day that he kind of
[2:00:12] had this attitude though he slay me
[2:00:15] that's what job said on maybe David had
[2:00:18] a little of that on him that day though
[2:00:20] he slay me I'm going to praise him
[2:00:22] anyway I cannot miss this opportunity to
[2:00:25] let this Joy bubble up within my spirit
[2:00:28] come on now the scripture then
[2:00:30] immediately calls our attention to how
[2:00:32] David
[2:00:35] danced and how he dressed to
[2:00:39] dance an ephod was a Priestly upper
[2:00:43] garment worn over a simple robe more
[2:00:47] like a loose tunic
[2:00:50] or
[2:00:51] vest the Bible said in 2 Samuel 6:14 in
[2:00:55] the complete Jewish Bible then David
[2:00:59] danced and spun
[2:01:01] around with
[2:01:07] abandon that's without
[2:01:10] restraint before adoni wearing a
[2:01:14] linen
[2:01:17] ritual vest
[2:01:20] I don't want you to see something as
[2:01:21] short as mine I want you to know that it
[2:01:24] was a longer vest that would have gone
[2:01:27] down just below his
[2:01:30] knees the problem with this is the Bible
[2:01:34] doesn't specifically
[2:01:36] say that he had the
[2:01:38] undergarment with
[2:01:41] it it says
[2:01:43] only that he danced with the
[2:01:48] ephod in 2 Samuel 6:14 in the NLT it
[2:01:51] says and David danced before the Lord
[2:01:54] with all his might wearing a Priestly
[2:01:59] tunic so I want you to understand that
[2:02:02] what he was wearing that day is
[2:02:04] something that he would not have
[2:02:05] normally wore
[2:02:08] alone it was a layer of of several
[2:02:13] garments that he would have worn when he
[2:02:15] appeared in
[2:02:16] public and the Bible is is clear to
[2:02:20] mention this to us it wasn't exactly his
[2:02:24] underwear as I've heard some describe
[2:02:27] but it was not a garment that went all
[2:02:29] the way to his ankles either this was
[2:02:32] the most humble of the garments that all
[2:02:35] common priest would wear before the Lord
[2:02:37] such a garment was a symbol that
[2:02:40] everyone recognized as being the Garment
[2:02:43] of a servant unto the Lord are you with
[2:02:45] me don't let him sleep next to you
[2:02:50] wake him
[2:02:55] up
[2:02:58] amen this was the
[2:03:01] king he would have been all right to
[2:03:04] wear the Royal garments that he was used
[2:03:08] to wearing every
[2:03:09] day nobody would have thought a thing if
[2:03:12] he would have even had a big fancy crown
[2:03:15] on his head and I don't know what all he
[2:03:18] could have had it all on but he chose
[2:03:21] that day hear
[2:03:23] me he chose that day to only dance in
[2:03:26] the servant's
[2:03:28] tunic the one that identified him as
[2:03:31] first and foremost not the king of
[2:03:34] Israel but a servant unto the Lord does
[2:03:37] anybody get anything in that in 1
[2:03:40] Chronicles chapter 15 it tells it like
[2:03:43] this verse 27 and 28 and David was
[2:03:46] clothed with a robe of fine linen and
[2:03:48] all the Levites that bear the ark and
[2:03:50] the singers in Shanah the master of the
[2:03:53] song with the singers David also had
[2:03:55] upon him an ephod of linen so normally
[2:03:58] there would have been more thus all
[2:03:59] Israel brought up the Ark of the
[2:04:01] Covenant of the Lord with shouting and
[2:04:03] with the sound of the cornet and with
[2:04:05] trumpets and symbols making a noise with
[2:04:07] Sultry and harps this would have been
[2:04:10] the normal
[2:04:11] protocol but Samuel tells us that David
[2:04:15] was humbling himself before the Lord and
[2:04:18] the returning Ark of his glory David was
[2:04:21] identifying himself in the eyes of the
[2:04:23] people as a simple servant of Jehovah
[2:04:26] there were no other kings to be adored
[2:04:28] that
[2:04:29] day David said I don't want the
[2:04:31] attention to be on me I want everybody
[2:04:34] to see the king of glory are you here
[2:04:37] David was making sure that on this day
[2:04:40] God received all the glory and all the
[2:04:43] honor David was far from naked and he
[2:04:45] was as he was accused but it is true
[2:04:48] that only on this day he laid aside his
[2:04:51] Imperial and Regal
[2:04:53] robes and that day David had no
[2:05:01] Pride I'm waiting on
[2:05:04] you no
[2:05:08] Pride everybody's got a little
[2:05:11] pride that day David had no Pride don't
[2:05:15] tell me that we don't all have a little
[2:05:16] bit of Pride well most of us do anyway
[2:05:19] we glanced in the mirror at least
[2:05:21] once some us some of us did everything
[2:05:24] we did in front of the
[2:05:28] mirror some people put their shirt on
[2:05:31] and their dress on and everything in
[2:05:33] front of the mirror cuz they didn't want
[2:05:36] to miss a
[2:05:37] detail they didn't want to miss a button
[2:05:40] they didn't want to miss a zipper most
[2:05:43] everybody that did their hair it's clear
[2:05:44] to see that some of you skipped that
[2:05:46] step
[2:05:47] but most everybody that does their hair
[2:05:50] they want to make sure they do it in
[2:05:51] front of a
[2:05:52] mirror we all have a little bit of pride
[2:05:55] in in the way we look and the way we
[2:05:58] present ourselves and it's not wrong to
[2:06:00] care about that because we are
[2:06:02] ambassadors for the king but that day
[2:06:05] David just simply didn't care he didn't
[2:06:07] care if his bangs were out of place he
[2:06:09] didn't care if his if his uh epod was
[2:06:13] disheveled uh can I just tell you I
[2:06:16] don't want to be too plain here but he
[2:06:18] just didn't care that there was probably
[2:06:20] way too much you
[2:06:22] know hanging loose Etc you know he
[2:06:26] didn't care it wasn't for women he was
[2:06:30] dancing to the Lord and he did it with
[2:06:33] all of his might in the message Pride
[2:06:36] brother brandham said and that's
[2:06:38] campbellville Kentucky brother brandham
[2:06:39] said oh Pride such a cursed thing so
[2:06:42] awful so evil is pride in the message
[2:06:45] the unwelcome Christ brother brandom
[2:06:47] said what a horrible curse pride is oh
[2:06:49] you're too good sure we go to church
[2:06:51] that knows better than that we don't
[2:06:53] believe in Divine Healing a we have
[2:06:55] nothing to do with that FY he said Jesus
[2:06:58] is in your
[2:06:59] town somebody got mad the other day
[2:07:02] because I used the term Pharisee when I
[2:07:04] was speaking about the ministers it shut
[2:07:06] down the moving of the spirit brother
[2:07:09] vandom used that term in the very same
[2:07:11] same line

[2:07:32] such an evil
[2:07:34] thing in a message called I stand at the
[2:07:36] door and knock brother B said there's
[2:07:38] another little door called Pride oh what
[2:07:41] a horrible little black Devil's all
[2:07:42] pinned up in the heart of Pride thinking
[2:07:45] you're better than somebody else don't
[2:07:47] get quiet on me now
[2:07:49] well I wouldn't send my children over

[2:08:14] Pride feels just a little a little
[2:08:16] complex you have there you go oh you
[2:08:19] don't want Jesus to touch that because
[2:08:22] it would degrade your social
[2:08:26] standing in the
[2:08:28] community you know we have to watch
[2:08:30] ourselves in the
[2:08:32] community right then then to go on he
[2:08:35] said I'd rather degrade my social
[2:08:37] standing in the community than to rub my
[2:08:40] name off the Lamb's Book of Life he said
[2:08:43] but they won't let him
[2:08:44] in that little pride holds him out come
[2:08:48] on
[2:08:52] now brother Shelly can you tell me why
[2:08:55] the gifts of the Spirit don't operate in
[2:08:56] the churches today yes I can because
[2:08:59] they won't let him in that little pride
[2:09:02] holds him
[2:09:05] out do you know brother Shelly can you
[2:09:07] tell me why there's not more Worship in
[2:09:09] the churches I sure can because they
[2:09:11] won't let him in that little pride holds
[2:09:14] him out there it is in the words of the
[2:09:17] prophet in the message is the queen of
[2:09:18] the South brother Bram said the same
[2:09:20] thing was thought when Jesus was born in
[2:09:22] Bethlehem they never sang hosan is when
[2:09:25] the king was born but the Angels sung it
[2:09:28] not the Kings and potentates but the
[2:09:30] Shepherds on the hillsides he wasn't
[2:09:33] born in a fine decorated hospital room
[2:09:36] with pink dressings hanging down come on
[2:09:38] he was born in a stinking manger how
[2:09:41] could they ever go to hear a man like
[2:09:43] that no matter what he' done you see
[2:09:46] what pride and selfishness does does it
[2:09:49] shuts you out from the kingdom of
[2:09:55] God so have enough Pride to comb your
[2:09:57] hair will
[2:10:00] you have enough Pride to make yourself
[2:10:03] presentable when you go out you're
[2:10:06] representing the King of Kings but
[2:10:08] please don't have enough pride and
[2:10:10] selfishness that you allow it to shut
[2:10:12] you out of the kingdom of God because
[2:10:14] you're afraid to praise the Lord you're
[2:10:16] afraid you're going to lose control
[2:10:20] David wanted control that day David
[2:10:22] wanted order that day but the joy of the
[2:10:25] Lord overtook
[2:10:27] [Applause]
[2:10:31] him the faucet's Bible dictionary says
[2:10:34] it like this David brought it up the ark
[2:10:36] stripping off his Royal robe in the
[2:10:39] presence of the symbol of Jehovah's
[2:10:41] Throne the true king and in a Lin and
[2:10:44] ephod to mark his assuming the Priestly
[2:10:47] along with the kingly function dancing
[2:10:49] before the Lord with all his might in
[2:10:51] other words he he unidentified himself
[2:10:54] as the king that's right and he
[2:10:56] identified himself as a Priestly servant
[2:10:59] unto the Lord you and I may have to
[2:11:02] unidentify ourselves as a as an esteemed
[2:11:06] family in the message come
[2:11:09] on you know the
[2:11:14] names he's
[2:11:16] a she's a
[2:11:21] we might have to unidentify ourselves
[2:11:23] from some of that the royalty of the
[2:11:26] message it's not just the Windsor that
[2:11:28] are royalty come on we have royalty even
[2:11:31] around the message of the hour you just
[2:11:34] name a
[2:11:35] name I remember dreading for my children
[2:11:38] to get old enough to know and care
[2:11:41] because of course I would have liked for
[2:11:43] them to think they came from a from a
[2:11:45] fine uh Elite family
[2:11:50] name imagine they're surprised when they
[2:11:52] found out that that I am so low among
[2:11:55] the Brethren that they don't even use
[2:11:58] the term brother or mister or Pastor or
[2:12:01] Reverend for
[2:12:02] me I have found myself at times so low
[2:12:05] among the Brethren they don't even use
[2:12:07] my first
[2:12:09] name they just say you you you you know
[2:12:13] Shelly you go to Shelly's
[2:12:17] Church
[2:12:19] uh you're a shell to my
[2:12:23] children I'm so thankful that most of
[2:12:26] the time they've said
[2:12:29] yes I pray they haven't been too often
[2:12:31] tempted to be like Peter and say what
[2:12:33] are you talking about I don't know
[2:12:35] anything about what you're saying no did
[2:12:37] I say Shelly I meant Shell
[2:12:41] House no no no Just sh not shell you
[2:12:45] must be
[2:12:47] mistaken Mel Saul's daughter accused
[2:12:50] David of dancing like a common man and
[2:12:54] beneath his station in life no robe no
[2:12:58] Crown to set him off is more important
[2:13:00] than others she did not care that he was
[2:13:05] dancing come on she cared that he was
[2:13:09] embarrassing her right she cared that he
[2:13:13] was lowering himself and his esteem and
[2:13:16] making himself a commoner
[2:13:18] he traded everything heavy do you know
[2:13:21] how heavy come on Royal robes can be
[2:13:26] come he didn't want anything weighing
[2:13:28] him down praise God I'm going to bound
[2:13:31] I'm going to rebound I'm going to dance
[2:13:33] with all my might I'm going to spin
[2:13:35] around and whirl I'm going to shout
[2:13:37] shout shout shout shout my praise I
[2:13:40] don't want anything holding me down so
[2:13:43] he laid aside that heavy confining Royal
[2:13:46] robe that Iden ified his position for a
[2:13:49] tunic that was
[2:13:51] loose and less confining for dancing
[2:13:54] it's time to dance he said there's a
[2:13:57] time to sit on a throne with a royal
[2:13:59] robe and a crown on my head but there
[2:14:01] comes a time when all I really want to
[2:14:03] do is Just Dance for Joy now notice he
[2:14:06] didn't say dance in the spirit I'm going
[2:14:09] to wait on the spirit of the Lord to
[2:14:10] take a hold of me force me to dance next
[2:14:14] thing I knew now brother brandom says it
[2:14:16] that way he said next thing I knew I was
[2:14:18] out there dancing right ahead of her but
[2:14:20] I would have to tell you that in my
[2:14:22] understanding of this somewhere along
[2:14:24] the way he had to make a
[2:14:27] decision what I find about getting in
[2:14:29] the spirit is there's a decision to be
[2:14:34] made oh I will I will I will not be
[2:14:41] moved I will I will I will not be moved
[2:14:45] I'll sit right here and hinder those
[2:14:47] around down
[2:14:49] me I will not be
[2:14:58] moved
[2:15:03] see the Bible
[2:15:06] said there'll come a time they'll stand
[2:15:08] in the door W hear me hear me they'll
[2:15:13] stand in the door and they won't go
[2:15:15] [Music]
[2:15:16] in come on and they won't let others go
[2:15:20] in if you think you're going to get by
[2:15:23] God like that sir you don't have to go
[2:15:26] in stay out keep your religious robes
[2:15:31] and your crowns of gold but get out of
[2:15:34] the way there's a servant of Christ
[2:15:37] there's a humble
[2:15:40] bride I don't want Pentecost as a
[2:15:43] denomination I don't want just that
[2:15:45] which was the carrier or the shop but I
[2:15:48] want the
[2:15:49] life it's the life that's going to cause
[2:15:52] us to overcome in this last day it's
[2:15:56] always the
[2:15:57] life the great Prince Matthew Henry said
[2:16:01] the great Prince thought it no
[2:16:03] disparagement to him to appear in the
[2:16:07] Habit in the tunic of a minister to the
[2:16:12] ark just let me serve the glory just let
[2:16:16] me serve the god of the box he wasn't
[2:16:19] worshiping the box he was worshiping the
[2:16:22] god of the box at that moment of David's
[2:16:26] Triumph when the ark had successfully
[2:16:28] entered into Jerusalem his wife Mel took
[2:16:32] exception to all this religious
[2:16:33] excitement and display her idea seemed
[2:16:36] to have been that the king should avoid
[2:16:38] mixing with the
[2:16:42] people that's how someone can attend a
[2:16:45] church from the time they're toddlers
[2:16:48] and not shake the pastor's hand until
[2:16:50] their wedding
[2:16:54] day I think I need another s
[2:16:59] swaller there are times when we just
[2:17:04] can't I just
[2:17:07] can't there are times I just can't but I
[2:17:10] try to make times when I
[2:17:14] can the king I'm not a king by I'm not
[2:17:17] saying that I'm just saying this Elite
[2:17:19] thing kind of hangs around on the
[2:17:21] message and now it used to be that the
[2:17:23] preacher listen this is this is how I I
[2:17:26] know you this church doesn't even really
[2:17:28] want to hear this but but let me tell
[2:17:30] you how they misuse Church
[2:17:33] order they love that quote that says the
[2:17:35] minister should stay in the back until
[2:17:37] he comes out to minister so that there's
[2:17:39] no distraction but what they don't tell
[2:17:41] you is that if it's in a convention or a
[2:17:43] camp meeting or a fellowship meeting all
[2:17:45] the preachers go back
[2:17:51] and they talk the entire
[2:17:53] time and sometimes just before the
[2:17:55] preacher is called to the buit the
[2:17:57] Entourage of preachers will come out and
[2:17:59] take their little place on the
[2:18:02] platform and I'm supposed to think
[2:18:04] they've been back there hearing from the
[2:18:05] Lord the whole
[2:18:07] time you see how people pick and choose
[2:18:10] what parts of church order they like and
[2:18:12] what parts they don't like and what and
[2:18:15] and condemn me because I like to come
[2:18:16] out and worship God like a
[2:18:23] commoner when I stand here behind this
[2:18:25] pullit I'm your
[2:18:28] pastor and his servant when I'm there
[2:18:31] I'm just his servant when I'm worshiping
[2:18:34] him I'm just his servant I'm just I'm
[2:18:37] just like you as a servant of the Lord
[2:18:40] that's right so uh Mikel she took
[2:18:44] exception to all this religious
[2:18:45] excitement and display this is tindell's
[2:18:48] commentary her idea seems to have been
[2:18:50] the king should avoid mixing with the
[2:18:52] people she despised him for the very
[2:18:54] qualities that made him
[2:18:57] great namely Devotion to the Lord and
[2:19:00] spontaneity In Worship the Bible said he
[2:19:02] was also playing an
[2:19:04] instrument 2 Samuel 6
[2:19:07] 20-23 then David returned to bless his
[2:19:10] household and Mel the daughter of Saul
[2:19:12] came out to meet David and said how
[2:19:14] glorious listen she's not bragging on
[2:19:17] him
[2:19:18] how
[2:19:23] glor today she's not only the queen of
[2:19:25] Israel she's the queen of
[2:19:28] sarcasm how glorious was the king of
[2:19:32] Israel today who uncovered himself today
[2:19:35] in the eyes of the handmaids of his
[2:19:38] servants as one of the vain
[2:19:41] fellows
[2:19:43] shamelessly uncover
[2:19:46] himself and David said unto
[2:19:52] Mel you know Mikel has a lot to be
[2:19:55] thankful
[2:19:56] for she could have had her cheek smacked
[2:20:00] that's I'm not saying that would be
[2:20:04] right but remember we're not talking
[2:20:07] about 2023
[2:20:11] culture we're talking about a culture
[2:20:13] where you you better know there was a
[2:20:15] distance between you and the man you
[2:20:17] were in
[2:20:18] insulting it was before the Lord he said
[2:20:21] which chose me before thy father and
[2:20:24] before all his house to appoint me ruler
[2:20:26] over the people of the Lord over Israel
[2:20:29] therefore will I play
[2:20:33] yeah therefore will I play before the
[2:20:37] Lord and I will yet be
[2:20:46] more
[2:20:49] let's see what that word means that's
[2:20:52] not a nice word is
[2:21:02] it it's
[2:21:10] kalal
[2:21:16] contemptible
[2:21:28] trifling
[2:21:33] Swift pretty serious word isn't it yes
[2:21:36] sir
[2:21:39] vow if this shook you up
[2:21:44] woman and I will yet be more vile in
[2:21:47] thus and will be base in my own
[2:21:51] sight and of the maid servants which
[2:21:54] thou has spoken of of them shall I be
[2:21:56] had in honor therefore Mikel the
[2:21:59] daughter of Saul had no
[2:22:04] child don't ever forget there was a
[2:22:08] penalty for judging David's
[2:22:13] worship she was struck
[2:22:15] Barren now never able to Bear a child
[2:22:19] specifically because she mocked she
[2:22:22] judged she evaluated the worship of King
[2:22:27] davidow don't wor don't evaluate or
[2:22:31] judge or play around with your words
[2:22:34] when you're talking about somebody
[2:22:35] else's worship if you don't understand
[2:22:38] it turn the other way if it distracts
[2:22:40] you close your eyes you're not supposed
[2:22:43] to Gaze on somebody else's worship is
[2:22:45] anybody with me you're not supposed to
[2:22:47] be looking closely at somebody else
[2:22:50] David led the choir
[2:22:52] uncovered Easton's Bible dictionary
[2:22:55] wearing only the ephod or linen tunic he
[2:22:58] thought only of the honor of God and ple
[2:23:01] being pleasing to God and forgot about
[2:23:03] himself can you imagine being so lost in
[2:23:06] your desire to please God that you
[2:23:08] forget about who you
[2:23:10] are just because a jealous individual
[2:23:13] says that someone is doing
[2:23:16] wrong
[2:23:19] doesn't make it so brother brandham said
[2:23:22] the curse was put on her that day that
[2:23:24] she could not bear children from the
[2:23:26] punishment Mel received it is obvious
[2:23:29] that she was the one in the wrong be
[2:23:32] careful what you're ashamed
[2:23:38] of if there's a husband here that her
[2:23:41] his his wife would maybe really Break
[2:23:45] Forth into freedom and that would
[2:23:47] embarrass you to the point of saying
[2:23:48] something to her you better be
[2:23:53] careful because her only relationship
[2:23:55] with God is not through
[2:23:57] you I know that's what they teach
[2:24:01] brother I know that's what they teach
[2:24:04] you can access God through your husband
[2:24:07] well I want you to know the Bible
[2:24:09] doesn't teach it that way you better
[2:24:11] have your own relationship with God you
[2:24:13] better understand the order of the home
[2:24:16] you better remain submissive to your
[2:24:18] husband but you don't have to wait on
[2:24:19] him to get on fire for God you may be
[2:24:22] waiting for eternity huh praise is the
[2:24:26] highest occupation of any being and
[2:24:28] here's a simple key don't ever miss this
[2:24:30] simple key in questions and answers
[2:24:32] number two paragraph 104 brother brandom
[2:24:34] said you go to the
[2:24:36] church you read it for me you
[2:24:45] got that's right you're still upset with
[2:24:48] one another coming over here on
[2:24:51] now then you're not really going to find
[2:24:53] your freedom in
[2:24:55] worship because you're in the spirit of
[2:24:58] Confrontation sir you're you got your
[2:25:00] feelings
[2:25:02] hurt you want him to know
[2:25:05] it you want her to know
[2:25:08] it you want them to you want him to look
[2:25:10] over there at you and see you all
[2:25:11] downtrodden and getting nothing out of
[2:25:13] the service so he'll know how deep the
[2:25:16] wound is is you know I'm telling the
[2:25:19] truth when you come in here you better
[2:25:22] forget who you are you better forget who
[2:25:25] who what man you belong to what woman
[2:25:27] you belong to you better remember that
[2:25:29] when you come in here you're a servant
[2:25:31] of the most high God and you better if
[2:25:33] you want to worship you better get in
[2:25:35] the spirit of
[2:25:42] worship that's hard to do when you stand
[2:25:44] around in the vestibule and talk until
[2:25:46] church time
[2:25:53] I got a camera on
[2:25:56] you I know who's in here and I don't
[2:25:59] know how many times we've said to one
[2:26:01] another well my we're not going to have
[2:26:05] very many
[2:26:06] today and then I come out here and it's
[2:26:09] full where was
[2:26:12] you where were
[2:26:14] you did you only get here at 5 till or
[2:26:17] were you standing around somewhere I
[2:26:20] don't know I'm I'm not out there I don't
[2:26:21] have a camera in the vestibule that's
[2:26:23] the next
[2:26:26] step I don't want to run this like some
[2:26:28] kind of military school but I want to
[2:26:31] tell you something you don't you don't
[2:26:33] you may not make it here 30 minutes
[2:26:35] before a service that's Church order
[2:26:38] too you may not make it here that early
[2:26:41] but when you get here you ought to spend
[2:26:44] a little time in anyway in your seat or
[2:26:49] around the altar decluttering your brain
[2:26:53] defragmenting your
[2:26:56] computer asking the Lord to forgive you
[2:26:58] for how you talk to your wife on the way
[2:27:00] to
[2:27:01] church whatever it is that you need to
[2:27:03] do come
[2:27:05] on because if you're going to come into
[2:27:07] worship you've got to get in the spirit
[2:27:09] of worship what wise words from the
[2:27:12] prophet now I want want you to want to
[2:27:15] move on with this to understand the
[2:27:17] situation one needs to go back and learn
[2:27:19] about
[2:27:20] Mikel this woman was Saul's youngest
[2:27:23] daughter you read that in 1st Samuel
[2:27:25] 14:49 and was given to David by Saul for
[2:27:28] David's defeat of the
[2:27:30] Philistines when David was in Exile I
[2:27:32] want you to hear this when David was in
[2:27:34] Exile she was given away
[2:27:38] again to
[2:27:40] Fel in 1st Samuel
[2:27:42] 25:44 and then bargain back to David
[2:27:45] from Abner as a part of a political move
[2:27:48] to strengthen his claim to the
[2:27:51] throne now how would that make you
[2:27:54] feel while you're gone in Exile your
[2:27:56] wife has taken from you given to
[2:27:58] somebody else's and the only reason why
[2:28:00] she's given back to you is because a man
[2:28:02] it's an election
[2:28:05] year and Abner wanted to be in position
[2:28:08] for the king so this woman
[2:28:12] Mel was a part of a political
[2:28:15] establishment and then all always lived
[2:28:17] in a politically correct
[2:28:19] environment when she sees her husband
[2:28:21] take off his kingly garments and Crown
[2:28:24] and become like everyone else and
[2:28:25] especially when she sees David
[2:28:27] participate in an undignified
[2:28:29] celebration she is incensed David's lack
[2:28:33] of political correctness is so bad that
[2:28:35] the Bible says she hated him she
[2:28:38] despised him in her heart which means to
[2:28:41] disdain with
[2:28:44] contempt in verse 22 of the the same
[2:28:47] chapter David responds to Mel by saying
[2:28:49] to her that the servants would hold him
[2:28:51] in special honor because of this conduct
[2:28:54] basically what you hate me for they
[2:28:57] honor me for today some of the greatest
[2:29:00] heroes in America are people who have
[2:29:02] defied political correctness to do
[2:29:04] what's right and
[2:29:06] fair we think of somebody like Rosa
[2:29:10] Parks not a not a not a a a you know a a
[2:29:15] woman with all kinds of accolades and
[2:29:19] degrees but just one particular
[2:29:22] day she was fed up with status
[2:29:28] quo she was commanded by City statue and
[2:29:32] by state
[2:29:34] law that when a white person came onto
[2:29:36] the bus she was supposed to give
[2:29:40] them her
[2:29:42] seat there were a few rows in the bus
[2:29:46] reserved
[2:29:47] for men and women of color in the back
[2:29:49] of the
[2:29:53] bus she chose her receipt that
[2:29:56] day and she refused to give it up and
[2:30:00] that's why she was given the great honor
[2:30:02] of Li lying in
[2:30:05] Repose in the capital building of our
[2:30:08] nation not a
[2:30:10] politician not a former president not a
[2:30:13] former president's wife but a hero
[2:30:15] nonetheless because she decided that I'm
[2:30:18] not going to be status quo and I'm not
[2:30:20] going to be politically correct
[2:30:22] today I'm going to keep my
[2:30:27] seat Mel believed that an emotional
[2:30:29] display is reserved for the lower class
[2:30:33] citizens that's how it was in the 50s
[2:30:35] and 60s in this nation when Pentecost
[2:30:38] was burning like a fire yes sir and the
[2:30:41] people mocked them and made fun of them
[2:30:42] and said they put itching powder on them
[2:30:45] and that's why they act the way they
[2:30:47] do did you know there were uh young
[2:30:50] Pentecostals early Pentecostals that
[2:30:52] were tarred and
[2:30:55] feathered tied up held
[2:30:59] captive painted with tar and rolled in
[2:31:02] chicken
[2:31:04] feathers because of the way they
[2:31:08] worshiped do you think that I would read
[2:31:12] a history like that and then let the
[2:31:16] devil get my praise in
[2:31:21] 2023 no
[2:31:25] way she was a slave to
[2:31:29] status Mikel was a slave to
[2:31:34] Pride she was a slave to putting on
[2:31:37] airs she had to be careful how she acted
[2:31:40] because the cameras were always on her
[2:31:42] so to speak
[2:31:44] right but David didn't care
[2:31:47] care he didn't
[2:31:50] care in the message all the days of our
[2:31:53] life sounds like a slop Hopper doesn't
[2:31:59] it brother brandom said in paragraph 24
[2:32:03] now we hear so much today about we are
[2:32:05] free oh we live in a beautiful America
[2:32:08] we're free oh the air is full of it
[2:32:10] books are wrote of it thousands of them
[2:32:12] but you're a million miles from being
[2:32:15] free
[2:32:16] brother Bram said you're not free don't
[2:32:19] you be deceived by
[2:32:22] that America's one of the greatest
[2:32:24] deceived Nations and in more bondage
[2:32:26] than any place I know of he said they're
[2:32:28] worse in bondage than communism could
[2:32:31] put them wait a minute communism can
[2:32:34] only hurt the body they can only put the
[2:32:37] body in bondage but when the Devil comes
[2:32:39] in he puts the soul in bondage anybody
[2:32:42] with me and man is a slave America is a
[2:32:45] bunch of slaves slaves you may be a SL
[2:32:47] slave to Pride you might walk up and
[2:32:51] down the streets and go through every
[2:32:52] store in every fashion that you can see
[2:32:54] on television and go from store to store
[2:32:56] trying to buy
[2:32:58] something you become a slave to it you
[2:33:01] become a slave to your dressing amen you
[2:33:04] can become a slave to your money amen
[2:33:06] that's the only thing that you you think
[2:33:08] of it is to make money grab and put it
[2:33:10] up here if you do
[2:33:14] that you're a Slave
[2:33:16] in the message Jehovah Gyra in paragraph
[2:33:19] 32 he said what ought all our conduct to
[2:33:22] be not like the world but we should act
[2:33:25] like Sons and Daughters of God conduct
[2:33:27] ourselves like King's children come on
[2:33:29] not like listen listen very carefully
[2:33:32] not like slaves of
[2:33:34] Fashions and slaves of
[2:33:37] passion and slaves of
[2:33:44] Pride did you know that the root of
[2:33:48] homosexual
[2:33:51] sin is not gender
[2:33:57] confusion did you know the root of
[2:33:59] homosexual behavior is pride yes sir did
[2:34:03] you know the Bible specifically tells us
[2:34:06] that that the reason that Sodom and
[2:34:10] Gomorrah was
[2:34:12] destroyed was not who was sleeping with
[2:34:15] who
[2:34:17] but it was the
[2:34:20] pride it was the worship of the human
[2:34:25] body did you know that the reason why
[2:34:29] this thing begins to
[2:34:31] come and now it's
[2:34:34] loose and now it runs from generation to
[2:34:37] generation come on now yes sir and now
[2:34:40] we not only have to deal with the spirit
[2:34:42] of homosexuality but we even have to
[2:34:44] deal with what the Bible call CS an
[2:34:46] eminent
[2:34:47] Spirit men who are not actively engaged
[2:34:50] in any kind of perversion but who act so
[2:34:53] feminine in all of their
[2:34:55] behaviors and the Bible doesn't say
[2:34:58] that's because he was raised by his
[2:35:01] mother the Bible says that's that is not
[2:35:04] pleasing to God and it has to be dealt
[2:35:08] with you know in our society it runs in
[2:35:13] music The Spirit uh uh of the effeminate
[2:35:17] Spirit and the pride Spirit and the
[2:35:18] homosexual spirit is is rampant in the
[2:35:23] musical
[2:35:24] industry and that's why it makes its way
[2:35:27] all the way to the
[2:35:31] church and it's
[2:35:33] pride and it has to be dealt with or
[2:35:37] it'll steal a generation of gifted
[2:35:39] talented young men gifted talented young
[2:35:42] women and pull them into slavery amen a
[2:35:47] spirit that didn't
[2:35:48] start with abuse as a child or rejection
[2:35:52] by a male figure but a spirit that was
[2:35:55] rooted and grounded and has its origin
[2:35:58] in
[2:36:00] Pride America's become slaves of fashion
[2:36:03] slaves of passion and slaves of Pride
[2:36:06] and we should be Sons and Daughters of
[2:36:09] God and act like it and conduct
[2:36:12] ourselves that way let our conversations
[2:36:14] and everything be what
[2:36:17] se but David didn't pay any attention to
[2:36:20] his wife's
[2:36:21] warnings David is beside himself the ark
[2:36:25] is coming home he can't control himself
[2:36:28] he can't stop furthermore he doesn't
[2:36:31] want to stop he's excited and it must be
[2:36:34] in display of his worship the way you
[2:36:37] express your joy May create misunder
[2:36:40] understanding it is likely that someone
[2:36:42] may misunderstand why you dance
[2:36:45] ecclesiast eses 3:4 there's a time to
[2:36:47] mourn and a time to
[2:36:49] dance and you may misunderstood what
[2:36:52] time it is in my
[2:36:53] life but I'm going to dance
[2:36:56] anyway David remember what he said it
[2:36:58] was before the Lord who chose me rather
[2:37:00] than your father or anyone from his
[2:37:02] house when he appointed me ruler of the
[2:37:04] Lord's people I will celebrate before
[2:37:06] the Lord I will become even more
[2:37:08] undignified than this and I will be
[2:37:10] humiliated in my own eyes but by these
[2:37:13] slave girls you spoke of I will be held
[2:37:15] in honor David said probably if I had to
[2:37:18] watch this in
[2:37:20] replay I would hang my
[2:37:24] head in
[2:37:26] embarrassment for how I
[2:37:31] acted I didn't mean to show
[2:37:35] out when people are in love they don't
[2:37:38] keep it to
[2:37:41] themselves they show it on the outside
[2:37:44] when people love the Lord hard they
[2:37:47] don't sit on their hands in church they
[2:37:50] show it on the outside they notify their
[2:37:53] face they notify their hands they notify
[2:37:55] their arms they notify their feet they
[2:37:58] notify their legs anybody with me
[2:38:01] dancing will cost you I'm going to tell
[2:38:03] you something people don't
[2:38:07] dance they don't worship like that
[2:38:10] because they know it's going to cost
[2:38:12] them
[2:38:14] something you better be willing to pay
[2:38:16] the price when I'm talking about dancing
[2:38:19] I'm not just talking about physical
[2:38:21] moving I'm talking about all forms of
[2:38:23] expression of joy and excitement and
[2:38:25] worship it wasn't a mere dance what
[2:38:28] David was doing was a sacrifice it was
[2:38:30] as much as a sacrifice as the animals
[2:38:32] that were being
[2:38:34] slain David was stepping out of his
[2:38:36] comfort zone hello
[2:38:39] sir now there's a Woman by the name of
[2:38:41] Anne Graham Loz you know who that is
[2:38:43] don't you the daughter of Billy Graham
[2:38:45] she says it simply this way this is
[2:38:47] where I got the title I brought this
[2:38:49] message in 2019 but I updated a little
[2:38:52] bit for today here's what she said well
[2:38:55] isn't she a woman preacher well she
[2:38:57] might be I I I don't follow her
[2:39:00] Ministry but she's not an
[2:39:03] idiot she said something powerful here
[2:39:07] she said a Christian will dance or
[2:39:09] die
[2:39:11] amen you know I hear message people
[2:39:13] quoting Muhammad Ali
[2:39:16] I hear them quoting all kinds of sports
[2:39:18] figures
[2:39:19] and common uh uh uh current interest
[2:39:22] folks but they might have something to
[2:39:24] say about me quoting a woman preacher I
[2:39:26] do it a
[2:39:30] lot I was raised by
[2:39:33] one a Christian will dance or
[2:39:36] die this what she said a Christian will
[2:39:38] dance or
[2:39:39] die you have no other
[2:39:42] choice you dance before the King of
[2:39:44] Kings or sit on the PE and be critical
[2:39:46] of those who
[2:39:49] do on and she said as soon as you're
[2:39:52] critical of those who do you
[2:39:57] die you either shout
[2:39:59] amen or you sit quietly and criticize
[2:40:02] those who
[2:40:03] do there's no neutrality in
[2:40:07] here when we enter into this holy and
[2:40:10] sacred place you're one or the other
[2:40:12] you're a dancer or a Dy
[2:40:16] you're a worshiper or
[2:40:23] a stick in the
[2:40:29] mud as we all know she said she goes on
[2:40:32] to say you can't even watch others dance
[2:40:34] and get
[2:40:36] by it's do it or die I want you to know
[2:40:40] there are moments in our life where if
[2:40:42] we don't dance if we don't worship if we
[2:40:45] don't press in we
[2:40:47] die maybe not physical death but
[2:40:50] spiritual death and isn't that
[2:40:53] worse to be sitting on a Pew spiritually
[2:40:57] dead isn't that worse than being
[2:41:00] physically
[2:41:01] dead I think
[2:41:04] so as we all know your dignity image and
[2:41:07] reputation are intangible assets but in
[2:41:10] some ways they can be far more valuable
[2:41:12] than money often we would give anything
[2:41:14] to protect and defend our our image what
[2:41:17] we're seeing in David's dance is that
[2:41:19] the man came to a place in his walk with
[2:41:21] God that he was so overwhelmed with
[2:41:23] gratitude so full of adoration and love
[2:41:25] for God that he took off his dignity
[2:41:28] royalty respect reputation and image and
[2:41:32] threw them all at the feet of
[2:41:35] God David's dance truly belongs in the
[2:41:38] domain of genuine worship but only
[2:41:41] because he sacrificed everything that
[2:41:43] had made him a king right there he gave
[2:41:46] it all up to
[2:41:48] God we may have to lay aside much of
[2:41:51] what we have used as our identity in the
[2:41:53] coming future the shells and facades
[2:41:56] that we have hidden behind the
[2:41:59] costume right that we have used to give
[2:42:01] us a false
[2:42:03] confidence Jesus has a different
[2:42:06] robe that he wants us to wear Isaiah
[2:42:09] 61:10 are you still there yes sir I will
[2:42:12] rejoice greatly in the
[2:42:14] Lord my soul shall be joyful for my God
[2:42:18] for he hath clothed me with the garments
[2:42:20] of Salvation he hath covered me with the
[2:42:22] robe of righteousness as a bridegroom
[2:42:24] deth himself with ornaments and as a
[2:42:26] bride adorne herself with her
[2:42:31] Jewels he wants you to lay aside the the
[2:42:34] the Garment of Pride the Garment of
[2:42:36] dignity the Garment of of
[2:42:39] royalty let me remind you of what
[2:42:41] brother brandham
[2:42:43] said in the message Is possessing all
[2:42:46] things I just shared this with you
[2:42:47] recently but I'm closing musicians are
[2:42:53] coming what a wonderful day to try to
[2:42:56] preach something like this when our
[2:42:57] worship was more sedated than
[2:43:04] usual Joshua I need another water son
[2:43:07] please this is a a two bottle
[2:43:11] day David danced before the Lord when
[2:43:14] the ark was brought back to its resting
[2:43:16] place amen when David saw the
[2:43:21] word it it wasn't just the ark it was
[2:43:23] what was in the ark the tables of stone
[2:43:27] brought back to its right place
[2:43:30] Hallelujah when the word is restored to
[2:43:34] its rightful place David saw it and he
[2:43:37] rejoiced by dancing before the Lord
[2:43:40] David rejoiced and danced in the spirit
[2:43:43] and even brother brandom somehow
[2:43:45] understood the word around and around
[2:43:49] and
[2:43:50] around why why did he dance because he
[2:43:54] felt
[2:43:56] it because the music moved him
[2:44:00] no all the
[2:44:05] word well they wouldn't be dancing like
[2:44:08] that they wouldn't be dancing like that
[2:44:10] if it wasn't for the beat of the drums
[2:44:13] oh they wouldn't be dancing like that if
[2:44:14] it for the tempo of the music oh they
[2:44:17] wouldn't be dancing like that let me
[2:44:19] tell you the dance that God put down in
[2:44:21] my heart yes I don't need no music I
[2:44:25] don't need no Tempo I don't need no
[2:44:27] drums
[2:44:30] hello well if I were African-American I
[2:44:33] would dance like that if I was African
[2:44:35] I'd dance like that if I was Spanish I'd
[2:44:37] dance like that if I was Brazilian I'd
[2:44:39] dance like that if I was from South
[2:44:41] America or Central America I would dance
[2:44:43] like that uhuh
[2:44:49] you
[2:44:51] wouldn't you do just what you do
[2:44:55] now
[2:44:59] set David saw the
[2:45:02] word he danced simply because the word
[2:45:05] was back in its place now how are you
[2:45:08] going to tell me we're beyond that kind
[2:45:10] of worship and how are you going to tell
[2:45:11] me it was all Pentecostal Shook and how
[2:45:14] are you going to tell me that we
[2:45:15] shouldn't have life in our services when
[2:45:17] David saw the word back in its
[2:45:21] place so they say things like you know
[2:45:24] don't carry on like that we've got the
[2:45:26] word well brother sister that's why we
[2:45:29] can carry on like that we've got the
[2:45:32] word the word is back in its
[2:45:39] place what the world needs is not out of
[2:45:42] some Seminary some theological mixup but
[2:45:45] an oldfashioned godsent preacher behind
[2:45:47] the pool pit with the word seeing God
[2:45:50] Vindicated proof then David said glory
[2:45:53] to God this is it and around and around
[2:45:56] and around and around his little stuck
[2:45:58] up
[2:46:01] wife don't you be
[2:46:04] her don't you be
[2:46:11] her little stuck up wife sat there
[2:46:15] set up there being the King's Daughter
[2:46:17] said why he embarrass he he he
[2:46:20] embarrasses me and David said you don't
[2:46:23] like
[2:46:24] that watch this and around and around he
[2:46:28] went again come on now come on now come
[2:46:30] on now devil if you don't like it you
[2:46:33] better look
[2:46:34] out I don't think that's the right
[2:46:39] spirit I don't think you ought to
[2:46:41] worship to spite somebody I don't either
[2:46:43] I think you ought to worship to glorify
[2:46:45] by
[2:46:47] God but if you can spite somebody in the
[2:46:54] process did I just say
[2:46:57] that if you can just shove it in the
[2:47:00] devil's
[2:47:03] face the old Pentecost say give that
[2:47:06] devil a black eye Hallelujah If You Can
[2:47:09] Dance un the Lord and give the devil a
[2:47:12] black eye at the same time why not go
[2:47:14] around and around around and around and
[2:47:15] around and around around why not why not
[2:47:19] why
[2:47:20] not what if we all did that at the same
[2:47:22] time it'd be an oldfashioned Pentecostal
[2:47:25] Revival I can answer that for you David
[2:47:28] said you don't like that watch this and
[2:47:30] around around went yeah oh my what a
[2:47:31] time he had you know God looked down out
[2:47:34] of heaven and said David you're a man
[2:47:36] after my own
[2:47:38] heart why he had done lost
[2:47:42] all Pride he had done lost all of this
[2:47:46] yes he was married to a king's daughter
[2:47:48] but that wasn't even considered then he
[2:47:51] know that he was acquainted with the
[2:47:53] possessor of heavens and earth and here
[2:47:55] was the word of God coming right back
[2:47:57] among them again and David was so happy
[2:48:00] who he
[2:48:02] danced he just danced as hard as he
[2:48:05] could Miriam she grabbed the tambourine
[2:48:07] and went down the bank dancing on the
[2:48:09] other side after she had come through
[2:48:10] the Red Sea and seen her enemies drown
[2:48:13] then she could dance in the spirit
[2:48:16] oh Hallelujah that's right now see after
[2:48:18] after the battle's
[2:48:20] won then the glory of God comes down
[2:48:24] that's
[2:48:25] right you can wait till it's all
[2:48:29] over and then
[2:48:34] dance little
[2:48:37] selfish or You Can Dance In the Heat of
[2:48:40] the
[2:48:41] battle I believe I'm going to dance in
[2:48:43] the battle
[2:48:45] enticing Spirits David danced before the
[2:48:47] Lord and his wife laughed at him and
[2:48:49] looked down out of heaven and God looked
[2:48:51] down out of heaven and said David you're
[2:48:53] a man after my own heart but his
[2:48:56] motives listen now we're nearly done his
[2:49:00] motives was right his life was right
[2:49:04] behind it remember remember Church
[2:49:07] remember that's where the word comes
[2:49:09] in you've got to live as high as you
[2:49:13] jump you you got to live like you're
[2:49:16] dancing and you're not dancing to the
[2:49:18] sway of the music that's right you're
[2:49:21] not dancing to be
[2:49:24] seen you're not dancing to draw
[2:49:26] attention to
[2:49:27] yourself and you know you won't do it if
[2:49:30] everybody's
[2:49:31] worshiping they won't even have a time
[2:49:33] to watch what you're doing that's right
[2:49:35] come on
[2:49:36] now now uh uh let me see I might not
[2:49:39] read that one because it's long and I
[2:49:41] just read
[2:49:43] it
[2:49:48] so I'll read a shorter version which
[2:49:50] I've also read in in in from the message
[2:49:53] only
[2:49:54] believe brother brandham said I never
[2:49:57] was at a dance in my life remember I
[2:50:01] just read this a few Tuesday nights ago
[2:50:03] but I heard only a holy dance one time
[2:50:05] in church I never forgot that when we
[2:50:07] was still a Baptist Church that's part
[2:50:09] of the problem right there I would
[2:50:12] always criticize kind of in my my heart
[2:50:15] he inherited criticism of dancing from
[2:50:18] the Baptist influence of his life why
[2:50:21] can't we just say that move
[2:50:24] on is that taking away from the prophet
[2:50:26] I hope
[2:50:27] not I think God knew exactly where he
[2:50:30] was going to find him sir he knew
[2:50:32] exactly where he was going to
[2:50:36] be so I don't think that's being
[2:50:38] critical to say this was his idea he
[2:50:41] said I'd always kind of criticize in my
[2:50:43] heart I wouldn't say it out loud out
[2:50:45] because I'd be afraid to do that
[2:50:46] anything that God does dot dot
[2:50:50] dot I always kind of thought it was kind
[2:50:52] of strange to see when I seen first got
[2:50:54] acquainted with the Pentecostal people
[2:50:56] to see them dance you know dance around
[2:50:58] I thought now you know that ain't in the
[2:50:59] Bible what what are they dancing about
[2:51:02] and then one day I was teaching from a
[2:51:04] chart on Daniel in Revelation well you
[2:51:07] know teaching on a chart ain't in the
[2:51:08] Bible
[2:51:12] either but it's a good way to express
[2:51:14] what you want to say it was a New Year's
[2:51:17] night I was going to teach on the chart
[2:51:19] until midnight it wasn't a chart like a
[2:51:22] Blackboard I was teaching and there was
[2:51:24] some Pentecostal people had come from
[2:51:26] Louisville uh they had awesome sisters a
[2:51:29] sister
[2:51:31] oh a sister pastored a church over there
[2:51:35] and she had
[2:51:36] a they had washboards and
[2:51:43] thimbles bless God we don't believe in
[2:51:45] Drums but we'll have washboards and
[2:51:48] Thimbles why to keep the
[2:51:51] Rhythm you need a little percussion in
[2:51:53] your
[2:51:54] sound and all kinds of little things to
[2:51:57] make rackets with and they all got
[2:52:00] harmonizing some way I don't know what
[2:52:02] it was and they she started playing the
[2:52:06] piano and all these girls got up there
[2:52:08] got the hitting with these simbl on the
[2:52:10] washboards and thing they got the they
[2:52:12] was playing that song there's going to
[2:52:14] be meeting in the air in the sweet sweet
[2:52:16] by and by well that little girl that was
[2:52:19] playing little lady
[2:52:20] Pastor she just turn white just like
[2:52:24] chalk and she just began to play in in
[2:52:26] such a way I I'd never seen anything
[2:52:29] play like it in my life and I thought
[2:52:30] now what's that and then one on the
[2:52:32] washboard she got to doing the same
[2:52:34] thing then here two or three got up and
[2:52:35] a little blond head got to dancing right
[2:52:37] in the floor and I thought oh
[2:52:40] my right up and down the floor as hard
[2:52:43] as she could just to dance in that way
[2:52:45] like the little old girl about 16 18
[2:52:47] years old I was just a young fellow
[2:52:50] myself now isn't that something right
[2:52:53] here in my
[2:52:55] church how I'll ever live that down and
[2:52:58] watching her like that and I thought
[2:53:00] what do they do that
[2:53:02] for there are people so foreign to
[2:53:08] it among the 333,000 people that have
[2:53:12] viewed the real
[2:53:15] it is so forign to some people they sayh
[2:53:18] are they swaying oh my goodness
[2:53:22] swaying you bunch of lunatics
[2:53:27] swaying can you imagine but but if you
[2:53:31] if you don't know about it you don't
[2:53:33] know about it they said why are they
[2:53:38] swaying Lord have mercy if swaying
[2:53:41] offends people I am in trouble
[2:53:45] what can I do that I won't
[2:53:48] offend and another person says I wish
[2:53:50] there was a church like this near
[2:53:54] Washington and another person said I
[2:53:56] wish we had a little more of that in my
[2:53:58] church and then somebody says I hope
[2:54:01] they don't think there's a God who sees
[2:54:03] them there's not even a God and there
[2:54:05] they are dancing before a God that
[2:54:07] doesn't even
[2:54:11] exist and somebody else sees and says it
[2:54:14] makes me want to praise the Lord like
[2:54:16] I've never praised him
[2:54:18] before come on it's according to the
[2:54:20] seed that's in
[2:54:22] you well how I ever live that down
[2:54:25] watching her like that and I thought why
[2:54:26] do they have to do that for why do they
[2:54:28] have to do that why couldn't they just
[2:54:30] played their
[2:54:38] music you know like a preacher like a
[2:54:41] six-foot
[2:54:43] icicle
[2:54:45] who's doing no more than blocking a
[2:54:47] picture of the baptistry the picture
[2:54:49] hanging on the back of the baptistry not
[2:54:51] feeding the body come
[2:54:53] on
[2:54:59] everywhere no
[2:55:02] anointing why do they do that for
[2:55:05] couldn't they just play their music and
[2:55:07] went on let it alone like that I thought
[2:55:09] well that's
[2:55:10] terrible I got to thinking now in the
[2:55:13] Bible is there such a thing as
[2:55:16] dancing and I remember that David danced
[2:55:19] around the ark when he saw the ark
[2:55:21] coming see he danced before the Lord and
[2:55:23] the Lord said he's a man after my own
[2:55:25] heart
[2:55:28] hello I thought well now did he what did
[2:55:31] he dance for well they had a victory
[2:55:33] yeah yeah and Miriam when they crossed
[2:55:36] over the Red Sea Moses sang in the
[2:55:38] spirit Miriam took a tambourine and
[2:55:40] began to beat it and they went down
[2:55:42] along the bank all the daughters of
[2:55:43] Israel dancing in the
[2:55:47] spirit is that
[2:55:49] right he said and I seen that dancing
[2:55:52] was when they had Victory I got to
[2:55:54] thinking well maybe I haven't got
[2:55:58] Victory
[2:56:02] enough that's one of your
[2:56:05] examples you said I don't have enough
[2:56:07] Victory I got to thinking about you know
[2:56:10] after a while I got to patent my foot
[2:56:12] Lord have mercy you might as well call
[2:56:15] that a Revival in a message
[2:56:20] church I got to patting my foot what did
[2:56:24] I do to
[2:56:25] it and before I knowed I was out
[2:56:30] there
[2:56:32] hello read
[2:56:40] it you got to have the context of the
[2:56:43] quote if I just took a portion of that I
[2:56:46] could preach that brother Brandon was
[2:56:47] out dancing with the
[2:56:50] girl he just meant I was sharing an
[2:56:53] aisle with her brother when the Holy
[2:56:56] Ghost moves and you feel freedom to
[2:56:58] dance you might share an aisle with
[2:57:00] somebody else that has the
[2:57:05] victory are you telling me if I don't
[2:57:07] Worship the Lord I don't have the
[2:57:09] victory that's exactly what I'm telling
[2:57:11] you I didn't say you had to dance to
[2:57:13] have a victory
[2:57:14] I said if you don't Worship the Lord you
[2:57:16] don't have the Victory and if you get
[2:57:18] enough of the victory you may have to do
[2:57:20] like David did and lay your pride down
[2:57:24] I'm
[2:57:25] closing psalm 16 8-11 no you're not well
[2:57:29] maybe I'm not but I think I
[2:57:31] am I have set the lord always before me
[2:57:34] because he is at my right hand I shall
[2:57:37] not be
[2:57:38] moved go back I want everybody to see
[2:57:43] it that is not the same as the song I
[2:57:46] sung a minute ago right sir I'll sit
[2:57:48] right here and hinder those around me I
[2:57:50] shall not be moved this is because I
[2:57:52] want to see the
[2:57:54] Lord I've set the Lord before me I'm not
[2:57:57] looking at my neighbor I'm looking at
[2:57:59] the Lord therefore I shall not be moved
[2:58:01] by anything that goes on around me in my
[2:58:03] life therefore my heart is glad and my
[2:58:06] glory rejoiceth My Flesh shall also Rest
[2:58:08] In Hope for thou will not leave my soul
[2:58:11] in Hell neither Willl thou suffer thine
[2:58:13] Holy One to seek ion thou will show me
[2:58:15] the path of life in thy presence is
[2:58:17] fullness of
[2:58:19] joy and at thy right hand there
[2:58:28] PL in thy
[2:58:32] presence there's fullness of joy and at
[2:58:36] thy right hand there are Pleasures
[2:58:37] forever more am let me read this the
[2:58:41] fourth
[2:58:42] seal
[2:58:45] let's just take a moment let's think
[2:58:47] about David he said he got all
[2:58:50] stimulated
[2:58:51] too I want you to hear what what
[2:58:54] stimulated David he said my cup is
[2:58:57] running over he said I believe he really
[2:58:59] had a great event in his life what caus
[2:59:01] him to do that now listen what brother
[2:59:03] BR when he was in the spirit for he was
[2:59:05] a prophet we know he was the Bible said
[2:59:10] so he's talking about
[2:59:11] David Prophet David now for he was a
[2:59:16] prophet he was in the spirit and look
[2:59:18] what he saw what I just read to you
[2:59:20] that's right brother random said he saw
[2:59:23] he seen the
[2:59:25] resurrection he said if you'd like me to
[2:59:27] read it Psalms 168 to11 that's what I
[2:59:29] just read moreover My Flesh was made
[2:59:31] glad I rest in Hope because you'll not
[2:59:33] leave my soul in Hell neither will you
[2:59:35] suffer your Holy One to see corruption
[2:59:37] brother brandom is saying that as David
[2:59:39] worshiped he was caught in the spirit
[2:59:41] and saw the resurrection no wonder his
[2:59:45] cup got to running over he said and
[2:59:48] after I tell you that his cup got to
[2:59:50] running over because he seen no matter
[2:59:52] what it was oh he seen the
[2:59:56] resurrection and he was really his cup
[2:59:59] Run
[3:00:00] Over Again David had another running
[3:00:02] over in 2 Samuel being that you got your
[3:00:06] pencils
[3:00:07] out 2 Samuel 6:14 there had been a dry
[3:00:12] spell they had took the Ark the enemy
[3:00:14] had come in and got the ark took it down
[3:00:16] and set it up before deeon deeon that's
[3:00:19] the fish god of the Philistines and
[3:00:21] deeon fell on his face and took it to
[3:00:23] another city and plagues broke out that
[3:00:25] was the hottest thing that had ever
[3:00:27] they'd ever had on their hands down
[3:00:29] there the word and they couldn't get rid
[3:00:31] of it cuz it was out of its place now
[3:00:34] when they put it on the ox cart and
[3:00:36] started back and when David saw the ark
[3:00:38] coming you know what he did he got so
[3:00:41] full so he's telling the different
[3:00:42] things that we we mentioned this morning
[3:00:45] he got so full and his cup got to
[3:00:47] running
[3:00:49] over you ever had your cup run
[3:00:56] over and his cup got to run and over and
[3:00:59] what did he call
[3:01:00] that remember what he says the
[3:01:02] stimulation of
[3:01:04] Revelation praise be to God when he seen
[3:01:07] the word being
[3:01:08] revealed back into Israel again he
[3:01:12] danced in the spirit all around and
[3:01:15] around and around and around and around
[3:01:18] like that his cup got to running over
[3:01:20] you see why he saw why he
[3:01:25] saw why are you
[3:01:28] rejoicing if you're rejoicing for any
[3:01:30] other reason you may miss the
[3:01:33] Mark if you're jumping for any other
[3:01:36] reason you may miss the mark But if you
[3:01:38] have rejoicing in your spirit because
[3:01:41] the word has found its proper place in
[3:01:43] in me yeah in you he said and I think
[3:01:47] that would make anybody anybody oh my
[3:01:50] preachers included come on that would
[3:01:53] make anybody get a little stimulated
[3:01:55] when they see after all these years and
[3:01:57] then the True Word by the promise that
[3:01:59] it would be being brought forth and
[3:02:01] Vindicated what a time what a time now
[3:02:05] when was
[3:02:06] this fourth
[3:02:09] seal still talking about David dancing
[3:02:12] in the spirit
[3:02:15] last quote I will restore De Moines oh
[3:02:18] no there's two
[3:02:20] more they're
[3:02:22] short if I don't get them I'll have to
[3:02:24] take another service on dancing and I'm
[3:02:27] I'm I'm tired of preaching on Dancing
[3:02:29] I'm just ready to
[3:02:32] dance see where it started in Genesis
[3:02:35] here their fundamental ritualistic
[3:02:37] beautiful big churches Orthodox people
[3:02:40] my in their beliefs sure but there's no
[3:02:43] signs
[3:02:44] following that'd be a problem wouldn't
[3:02:46] it Jesus said these signs will follow
[3:02:49] them it come from Genesis and going into
[3:02:52] Revelations the same thing what signs
[3:02:57] following all the way through the book
[3:02:59] Genesis to Revelation same thing I'm so
[3:03:02] glad I can
[3:03:03] say I'm one of them by the grace of God
[3:03:06] by one of who those that have it from
[3:03:09] Genesis to Revelation signs following
[3:03:12] wouldn't swap it for nothing in the
[3:03:13] world oh sure they call me this and that
[3:03:16] or the other that don't make any
[3:03:18] difference what they call me God calls
[3:03:20] me his
[3:03:22] son amen that's the main thing you see I
[3:03:26] seen that little girl that time David's
[3:03:28] wife that hid behind her
[3:03:31] fan Fanning like
[3:03:34] that she thought David her sweetheart
[3:03:36] was the cutest little
[3:03:39] thing but when oh honey she only saw him
[3:03:43] as her way into the
[3:03:44] palace he could have had a ward on his
[3:03:46] nose and she wouldn't have
[3:03:48] cared she was looking out for
[3:03:51] herself not for David but he was maybe
[3:03:55] attractive to her in some way but when
[3:03:57] the ark come in and David saw
[3:04:03] it read
[3:04:07] that a Revival was in
[3:04:10] session praise God little Lord David
[3:04:13] went down there and danced around the
[3:04:15] ark as hard as he could go why she said
[3:04:17] you embarrass me why you embarrass me my
[3:04:20] well I'll have the general Council to
[3:04:21] put you out we'll call the Deacon board
[3:04:25] you embarrass
[3:04:29] me he said if you don't like that watch
[3:04:31] this and down he went around and around
[3:04:33] and around and around the ark he went
[3:04:34] rejoicing happy shouting praising God
[3:04:36] and rejoicing Hallelujah said if you
[3:04:39] don't like
[3:04:42] that God looked down out of the heavens
[3:04:46] he said David you're a man after my own
[3:04:49] heart how many of you'd like God to say
[3:04:51] that about you so it don't make any
[3:04:53] difference what the world
[3:04:56] says what the message clicks say right
[3:05:00] it's What God Says amen my last one
[3:05:03] demonology now of everything that God
[3:05:06] has the devil has a counterfeit you go
[3:05:08] and whatever you want to do you find
[3:05:11] like these old dances is of the
[3:05:14] devil I want everybody to read this one
[3:05:16] together 1 2 3 but
[3:05:22] God well I can't dance because the world
[3:05:25] dances well I can't dance because I see
[3:05:28] in the charismatic churches and women up
[3:05:30] there swaying and
[3:05:32] dancing that's just other excuses right
[3:05:35] God has a holy
[3:05:38] dance
[3:05:42] people
[3:05:44] the Bible said so listen what brother
[3:05:46] random tells about himself I was one of
[3:05:50] the greatest Critics on that you ever
[3:06:00] seen till God told me just what to
[3:06:04] do I found out that Miriam danced in the
[3:06:08] spirit David danced when he had the
[3:06:10] Victory and all many time all of it was
[3:06:13] through
[3:06:14] was Victory it was
[3:06:19] dancing that
[3:06:26] stand holy
[3:06:28] dancing what makes it
[3:06:33] holy what makes it holy Dancy what's the
[3:06:36] difference between holy dancing and
[3:06:38] worldly
[3:06:39] dancing holy dancing is unto the Lord
[3:06:45] it's not rock and roll based it's not
[3:06:49] sway Cadence of the music
[3:06:51] based it's not just excited to be
[3:06:54] excited
[3:06:55] based it's
[3:06:57] remembering God has give us the
[3:07:00] word we go to we get to go to
[3:07:04] heaven God has given us the word isn't
[3:07:07] he good give him a hand
[3:07:09] clap give
[3:07:12] him
[3:07:14] [Applause]
