TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit [Music] but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the water that's what makes the big difference is the great mystery right at Christ in you the hope of north [Music] hello there I'm Pastor Steven Shelley I'm coming to you from the good old state of Alabama New Hope revival ministries we're just delighted to be able to speak to you today on behalf of brother Eric Erickson and the gospel channel what an amazing blessing that God is giving the world from that tiny little island of Iceland I don't know if you've ever visited Iceland but I'm telling you it's a beautiful place when I think about a nation a little island with such a small population less than four hundred thousand and yet God gave our brother Erickson a vision much bigger than Iceland he had a vision a desire to reach the entire world with the truth with a revelation of Jesus Christ and that's why God is blessing the gospel channel in times like this so I ask you to join me in prayer praying that God will continue to sustain the ministry and that he will expand it and allow it to reach out until every nation is being reached touched by the gospel of Jesus Christ through the gospel Channel I realize there are many Christian television networks around the globe but my heart is intricately connected with the gospel channel and I'm believing that together we're going to see the vision that God gave brother Erickson absolutely manifest and come to pass so not only partner with us in prayer but continue your giving and if you've never taken an opportunity to sow into the Ministry of the gospel channel I can tell you by personal experience it's not a wasteful place they're prayerful they're mindful the things that they do to expand the network or carefully prayed over fasting goes on and what they do they do by the direct leadership of the Lord so I just want you to know I'm standing with them and we invite you to and with them as well I believe in the power of prayer and so we invite you anytime during this program call us in the state of Alabama I don't know what hour you're watching but there's a number a toll-free number available for you on the screen we may not be in the office if it's in the middle of the night Alabama time but I promise you we'll take your message we'll hear it in fact I hear them personally on my computer and I'll go to prayer for you and so will the saints who worship here at new hope revival ministries why because we love you because we care about you and because we have experienced for many many years now the power of agreement in prayer in faith and we want to see God move on your behalf in this exciting brand spanking new year of 2018 it's a fresh clean opportunity to do something for the kingdom of God and to make Jesus the Lord of your life I was recently speaking to you about making that transition from the Hebrew year 5777 to the Hebrew year 5778 which is 2018 on the Gregorian calendar both of the years ending in an eighth which is a number of new beginnings you might remember that we talked about in one of our times together that God was speaking specifically to us as we were making that transition into the new year that it wasn't going to be a year of just ordinary new beginnings where new things entirely new things are starting in our lives but it was also going to be a revisiting of some of the things that God had promised that he had sown maybe a vision a goal a desire a passion that you had to see something accomplished in the kingdom of God and it started out with a bang you saw God pouring water on it and it was being fertilized and it was growing and sprouting and then all of a sudden something happened maybe the enemy came against it in a great onslaught maybe you grew weary maybe you grew discouraged maybe the finances were cut off but something happened in that new beginning in your life it quickly faded away well I have good news for you I believe that 2018 is a year of the resurrection life of Jesus Christ and we're praying we're believing God not only for our ministry for the families that worship with us in Alabama and around the world but also you who are watching us on the gospel Channel we believe that God wants to do something in your life this year to resurrect old dreams old visions prophetic promises things that you've been holding on to things that you saw beginning to unfold and then all of a sudden for some reason cut off so I just decree and declare in the authority of Jesus Christ that if you will make him Lord of your life not just call him Lord but make him Lord and if you will continue to walk in his ways to surrender your heart to his word I want to remind you that serving God is not a lucky charm it's not some sort of you know like a lucky rabbit's foot or horseshoe over the door or whatever lucky traditions you might have in your area or in your culture serving God is so much different than that it's not something that we use only when we're in trouble serving the Lord is a day by day hour by hour relationship with the God of the universe imagine that and if we continue in that relationship if we let that relationship grow in 2018 then I believe we have every right to stand before the throne of God in prayer and believe for the resurrection life of Jesus Christ to be poured out on all of those beginnings that didn't go very far I believe this can be the year that they spring forth to accomplish everything that God desires to accomplish in your life and for you I know many of your burden for your family because things are getting really tight out there in the world there's a lot of anger there's a lot of resentment bitterness violence there's a lot of hatred maybe some of you have family members who get caught up in the in the sway of that kind of an of an attitude and a spirit and it begins to sort of take control of their lives and you've been very very concerned and very worried what about believing God with me that in 2018 there can be mighty deliverances in the lives of your family members I want to tell you that if you personally want to be an influence to your family to your neighbors it's not the preaching that you do with your mouth it's the preaching that you do with your life that's gonna make a difference this year people aren't really looking for more talk in this age of information they're looking for more walk they're looking for a people who want to live the life a different life in fact the Lord spoke to us as we were making that transition from 2017 into 2018 and he said choose the life tonight now choose the life that you're going to live in 2018 it can be the soulish life one that comes from the mind and the will and the emotions or it can be the Christ life the surrendered ascended life and I like something else that the Spirit of the Lord said the supernatural life a life where God works with us and through us in a way that is beyond natural explanation if I sat here and tried to explain to you the supernatural I would look like a bumbling nutcase because the supernatural cannot be explained it's just that super natural it actually supersedes the natural realm even the natural laws I've seen the power of God do in that realm what we could never accomplish by ourselves in the natural realm that's the kind of life that we want to live not just in 2018 but until the Lord comes for his people we want to be living that supernatural life it's a crazy life and when I say crazy I mean that in a good sense it's not it's not a life of insanity it's a life of excitement and a life of who knows what's coming next but if I'm trusting God and God is at the control tower it's going to be okay you may be crying one minute and jumping up and down with joy the next minute but that's the life of an ordinary Christian and when I say ordinary Christian I should say it's the ordinary life of a supernatural Christian because if we're just ordinary Christians hearing the words and confessing speaking the truth but not living the truth we're not going to see the supernatural life have you ever noticed how that two people can look at the same thing and describe it so entirely different I think we're all familiar with that proverbial expression is the glass half-empty or is the glass half-full if you're optimistic they say you'd be more likely to say if there's a half a glass of water in front of you you'd be more likely to say it's half-full but if you're pessimistic or negative and they say you'd have a tendency to say why it's half-empty two people looking at the same glass but describing it very very differently you know this is the way it is in our relationship with Jesus Christ because sometimes we're looking at things in the natural and in the natural Vey look bleak they look dark they look impossible but if we should choose to look with spirit eyes with his the eyes of God we would see it entirely different in fact I'm thinking of Joseph in the Bible when he had been betrayed by his brothers sold into slavery after being left for dead he ends up in the prison in Potiphar's house you know the story of Joseph finally he is exalted from the pit through the prison and finally from the prison to the palace and God begins to do amazing things in Joseph's life and finally because of a famine in the land God marches the Brothers of Joseph right down to Egypt and puts them right before his authority and when he realizes what's happening he says something so beautiful it's one of the reasons why when we study the scripture we see the life of Joseph as being a beautiful type of the life of Jesus Christ because Joseph looks at his brothers with forgiveness he hasn't forgotten what's happened but he's forgiven them it's evident by this statement what you meant to me for evil God meant to me for good when you read the story of Joseph and you hear how they were jealous of him because he had dreams he had supernatural spiritual experiences his brothers were jealous they resented him they told him to shut up quit talking all this spirit talk you're just trying to to woo our Father you just want to be the favorite when you read that your heart goes out to Joseph and then all the things that happen they put him in a pit they're gonna leave him for dead they they take that coat of many colors they dip it in the blood of an animal they take it back to his father and tell him that he's gone one of the brothers speaks up you know and they end up instead of leaving him to starve to death they sell him into slavery he's carried by Caravan Caravan to various parts of the world he ends up in Egypt of all places you that and your heart goes out to him then he's betrayed he refuses the advances of Potiphar's wife and therefore she lies about him he ends up in prison he interprets the dreams that the prisoners are having and one of those prisoners is exalted out of prison with the promise I'm going to to tell I'm gonna tell the authorities what's happened and and you're gonna be delivered out of here I'm gonna tell the whole story and they forget about him when you read this story your human heart your human compassion has to go out for Joseph he's really been through a lot when we look at that story we would say one knockdown after another one dark fiery trial after another there's no good to be seen in it with our natural eyes but I want you to know if you look at it with another set of eyes you'll see that one by one through every one of those trials God was refining the character of Joseph because he wanted to use him as a savior for his family and truly when we study the story we find out that it wasn't just his family that he was preserving but the entire household of Israel what a glorious true story in the Bible this isn't somebody's novel of fiction this is nonfiction I believe this with all of my heart I believe what I've read in God's Word about Joseph and in my mind I'm thinking at each little turn and twist in the road he's gonna be so bitter when this is over you know looking at it from a human standpoint and yet he refused to allow bitterness I just felt something in the spirit when I was speaking about bitterness and I want you to know that it is not entirely impossible that you and I as believers can yield to bitterness it's a temptation when we see wicked people prospering and the righteous people sometimes really suffering it can feel unfair we can misunderstand we can feel forsaken and all of those feelings of abandonment and rejection can start working themselves to the surface the next thing you know a root of bitterness can take a hold in your life and you begin to make excuses for your lack of discipleship for your lack of spiritual growth bitterness begins to to expand in your heart and become a stronghold you start blaming other people for where you are why you don't have what you what you what you need what you want what you wanted and looked for believed for you can turn all of those emotions toward people and the next thing you know you can lose your place in the spirit you can really go down in defeat so I want to say to you right now if you recognize that a root of bitterness has tried to take you out of this battle a root of bitterness has tried to disqualify you from being all that God has created you to be don't go another day don't go another hour with that root of bitterness recognize it you don't have to be condemned by it but recognize it and go to the one who has the surgical knife in his hand I'm telling you the Word of God can both comfort us and correct us it can soothe us and it can also operate on our lives with the precision of a surgeon's tool cutting out those things as we submit them to the Lord you know I think we live entirely too long with things like bitterness unforgiveness those feelings of rejection and I believe the reason why we choose to live with them so long it's because we're ashamed to bring them to the only one who can do something about it I think sometimes we try counseling we try talking to friends we try talking to family members sometimes we end up getting even more angry because they can't seem to understand what we're going through and so we keep it locked inside with again it's it has adverse effects on both our physical health and our spiritual health why don't we just bring them to the one who loves us the most the one who knew before the foundation of the world our strengths and our weaknesses why don't we just give them to the great surgeon of all surgeons and allow his word to come in and cut that root of bitterness out of our life I feel like I'm speaking to someone right now who's struggling in that area don't you be ashamed don't you let the enemy condemn you for that you just recognize let the Spirit of God turn the searchlight of his love onto that area of your soul right now let him expose it let him walk you through the the steps that led to the place where you are right now and let him show you another perspective instead of looking at the glass half-empty let God open your eyes to see it full okay half full but full of potential full of what God could eventually turn into abundance he can so fill your half filled cup until it's running over and the saucer is spilling over the excess no matter what you're in right now it's not forever it's not eternal it's shaping something in you if you are a true believer if you have surrendered your life to the word I didn't say a perfect Christian I just said fully surrendered and fully surrendering it's not something we do once and we never have to do it again we're fully surrendering daily to God's perspective to God's will Joseph could have so easily been disqualified he could have so easily failed in any of those many testings siftings that he went through but he was faithful to the and I'm glad that he was and I'm glad that like our Lord when he was on the cross our Lord looked at those who had wrongfully accused him who had lied and slandered his integrity so that they could crucify him thinking in their mind that if they killed him they could do away with the influence that he was having on the people his life was exposing what dry religion what dead dry theology can do in people's lives he was challenging those who were clinging to the written word while rejecting the reality of the Living Word and because of that they wanted to silence his voice they wanted to malign his character they just wanted to get rid of him he's hanging on the cross in agony that I cannot imagine in pain that I cannot begin to understand and he cries Father forgive them for they know not what they're doing like Joseph who said to his brothers you Memphis to me for evil but God meant it to me for good what if in 2018 we turn our faith around a little bit instead of wallowing around in self-pity we attach our faith to God and to his word and to his promise and we claim those new beginnings of old beginnings what if we really allow him to do what he has wanted to do in our lives ever since we started on this Christian journey if we could do that together if the people of God could realize that we get to choose the life we live in 2018 no there are circumstances that we don't get to choose there are situations around us that are out of our control but we do get to choose whether or not we're going to live it a life of hypocrisy a life of just soulish flesh desires or whether or not we're going to live it surrendered to the Spirit of God and to the Living Word who lives inside of us if we've welcomed him if we've allowed him to come in it's those who are doing everything in their power their strength which is often not enough but they're doing everything they can in their strength to be obedient to the example to the teachings the instructions of the Lord Jesus Christ and those truths that are contained for us in this word of God those are the ones who are going to be positioned in 2018 to live an ascended life when I say ascendant I don't mean in the terms of Eastern mysticism I mean in the upward life the upward call that spoken to us about that is spoken to us in the epistles we're different ones of the of the writers of the epistles both Paul and Peter and even John speak about this upward pull of the Spirit of God the ascended life the call of the Spirit that takes us above our circumstances above our aches and pains above our murmurings and complainings it takes us up into an entirely different perspective it's like this when we're when we're walking on the ground when we're walking saying it in a downtown area and we're looking at those tall buildings we're looking at things bye-bye our present perspective they look so massive those buildings look so tall but if you've ever flown over a metropolitan city in an airplane from that much higher vantage point everything looks entirely different those those skyscrapers of big cities they look like real match boxes those vehicles that are sometimes are taller than we are big SUVs taller than we are and yet from that vantage point of the airplane they look like tiny little ants moving around and certainly you can't even see the people once you you get so high the higher you get the more your perspective of things has changed the higher we allow the Spirit of God to lift us up by the revelation of his word in 2018 it's going to change the way we look at everything the higher we get the smaller our problems the smaller our circumstances will begin to look and the bigger our God will become in our lives one of the great greats one of the great Giants of the faith one time said we must not look at the bigness of our problems we must choose to look at the bigness of our God and truly indeed he is big he is larger than large he is more capable than we can even imagine he not only created the world but he keeps everything moving in its rhythm I know sometimes we doubt that when we see what evil is doing and what men are doing by their wicked imagination but don't you be fooled by the hour we're living in God is still sovereign he is still supreme and he is bringing the people into his life into his character as the Apostle Paul described it Christ in you his life his truth his Spirit being formed inside of us until we began to think his thoughts put you on the mind of Christ we began to do the works that Jesus would do if he were standing on this earth in a physical body today remember the Gospels remember the promise that Jesus left us will you say he left that to his earthly disciples his contemporaries those who were living with him in that hour know he left that to all of his disciples of which I am one and I trust that you are one who studies the truth of God's Word and depends on the Spirit of the Lord to make that word alive in you your life is being shaped by the word discipled disciplined by the Word of God if that's the case you're just as much as a disciple of Jesus Christ as was Peter as was John Matthew or any of the original 12 and if Jesus made a promise to them greater works than this shall you do because I go to my father I claim that promise I believe by the power of the Holy Ghost but the modern disciples of Jesus Christ the present-day disciples of Jesus Christ have the same power the same Authority the same God to work through them to work through their lives today as he did nearly 2,000 years ago well I don't see a lot of that going on you're no brother Shelly I don't see a lot of that happening well I want you to know the best is yet to come I want you to know that God is helping us to get position by the things that we go through and the harvest that we have prayed for is upon us don't you believe the lie of the enemy and choose to see things God's way instead of the way that maybe someone living the life of hypocrisy would see them or the one who's living that negative life would see them let me give you an example of how things can similar things can be viewed in many many different ways depending on where someone is in their thinking depending on where someone is in their spiritual journey at any given time in Matthew chapter 26 and indeed all of the four Gospels there is a story and I'd like to read a portion of it to you in Matthew 26 beginning in verse 6 now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper there came unto him a woman have an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat but when his disciples saw it they had indignation this is anger and wrath saying to what purpose is this waste for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor when Jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me for ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not always for in that she poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial verily I say unto you wheresoever this gospel is preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman hath done be told for a memorial of her hey you and I are fulfilling Scripture right now you're watching maybe you're sitting in your living room watching Christian television I'm sitting in our studio in Alabama the United States and both of us we're fulfilling Scripture the very words of Jesus because he said wherever this gospel shall go what this woman has done will be a memorial unto her it will be remembered to her for generations to come and indeed we're remembering what she did the disciples looked at this ointment that was poured on the body of the Lord and because of where they were at the time maybe there were bills about to come do maybe they you know really weren't caring about the poor at all who knows what was in their mind but what we do know is what they were walking through at the moment or what they were thinking what their thought process was at the moment deeply affected their discernment it deeply affected their judgment and they among themselves began to murmur the indignation the Bible said what a waste what a waste of money this ointment could have been sold the money the value given to the poor but Jesus he knew the rest of the story he knew the end and he didn't call it a waste rather but a memorial a good work for this precious woman who had been forgiven much we believe and therefore she loved much there is some controversy among theologians as this story is told in Matthew Mark Luke and John is there one woman did this happen one time or did it happen two times and they don't always agree because in one of the Gospels it says that she washed his feet with her tears and dried them with her hair it's possible that this is two different women or perhaps one woman but the truth remains in each of the gospel tellings someone misunderstood it someone judged it wrongly someone called it a waste in Jesus discerned what they were saying and he corrected them quickly and explained to them there was an entirely different way of looking at this circumstance I just wanted I want to do that for you today I want to tell you that the pain of the moment the confusion of your circumstances right now can cause you to look at things in your life what a waste it can cause you to say nothing good could ever come out of that it could even cause you to believe that God has forsaken you or abandoned you you've failed him so many times he's given up on you I don't know how you're feeling right now but I can tell you this it's so amazing to me how one thought process early in the morning can affect the rest of my day if I start my day in prayer if I start my day in praise and in worship and glorifying God as I did this morning it makes an entirely different day for me do bad things still happen sometime do I get under stress before the day is over sometime do I get bad news sometime but the truth is my frame of mind is adjusted by connecting with my father first thing in the morning if you missed your chance this morning do it now connect with him now if you find yourself getting off course during the day bring your thoughts into submission to God's precious word for your life the Bible says that he has good thoughts towards you he wants to bless you and prosper you not curse you but he's bound to his word his blessings are not to be poured out upon every person on the planet his blessings are often reserved for those who are willing to make that decision to walk in his truths to surrender to his precious word folks this is not a just a dusty history book this is the written record of who God is not just who he was but who he is you say how is that possible brother Shelly because every name mentioned in this book they've been dead for nearly 2,000 years but I want you to know that the scriptures are clear this word was preserved for us not just so we would know who God was but so that we could know who God is there's something you need to know about religion and that is religion can get way off course denominational Christianity can get way off course when we start mixing God's truths with man's interpretation with man's ideas we get a mixture that can often take you so far away from God that the God you're serving in your mind is not the God of the Bible at all I don't think necessarily that religion has plotted this or religious people have have plotted this in their minds to do this to people on the planet but what I believe is that the enemy has taken full advantage of the thought processes of men and I just encourage you as we're entering into this new fresh year examine your processes of thought examine what the enemy is saying how do you know how do you know the enemy is talking to me because I know the enemy I know the enemy I've watched him long enough I've studied the way he operates long enough and I've experienced his attacks long enough that I know that if there's even the smallest desire in your heart to serve the Living God I know the enemy's lying to you I know that he's got another lie preparing right now to feed you at the moment that you're already broken or vulnerable I know that he will feed you with a spoon one lie after another until you become so discouraged or so bitter that you give up on serving the Lord altogether I beg you I implore you in the name of Jesus Christ don't allow the devil to win in your life people are counting on you your lost family members are counting on you some of your saved family members are counting on you to be strong to stand on God's Word defeat the enemy you see ultimately Jesus defeated the enemy at the cross and that defeat was sealed signed sealed and delivered on Resurrection Day when Jesus conquered death hell and the grave and he rose from the dead victorious triumphant over every trick the enemy tried to stop the influence of his life there's virtue in the life of Jesus Christ that's available to the believer today examine some of the things that you've been looking at it you're in your life see if you're looking at them from Earth's perspective or if you're struggling to look at them from God's perspective get above the scene here's a woman in some of the Gospels the woman is described as a woman without good reputation she made this money perhaps in very questionable ways get up above the scene looked down at this woman look at this precious alabaster box at least a couple hundred dollars of value at that time it would be of great value today see this moment see the Pharisee who invited Jesus into his home and then allowed him to sit in the corner without any ointment for his feet for his head without a proper welcome without proper salutation he's sitting in the corner invited but unwelcomed unfortunately that's the condition of many churches around the world today invited in because his name is on the door but he sits if he indeed comes he sits in the corner with no one to kiss his face to welcome him no one to wash his feet no one to anoint his head as was the custom of his earthly life the time that he lived what a shame what a shame that the book of Revelation tells us that in the last church age our Lord Jesus is standing on the outside of his own church knocking on the door we often use this analogy to refer to Jesus knocking on the door of our heart to come in with salvation but the context of the scripture is that Jesus is knocking on the door of the church if you will open the door I will come in unto you I will sup with you I will sit at meet with you we will fellowship together we will have relationship together we will become one as we have spoken about before and yet the church can be so busy with her programs so busy with her doing good that she misses her opportunity to walk every day in union in relationship with Jesus Christ but I tell you in the name of the Lord around the world in every nation there's a bride that's being identified in this hour God is calling to her a deep calling in the in the deep the deep calling to the deep you're becoming so dissatisfied with religion as it is Church as usual that you're calling out for more of God in fact somebody is watching this program right now and your exact words have often been there's got to be more than this there has to be more than this and I'm telling you in his precious name right here on the gospel channel there is more than ordinary Christianity there is more than just knowing him by name and not by life there is more you've just got to come up a little bit above the circumstance and look down and see it with a different perspective what you meant to me you brothers as Joseph was looking at them you deceived our Father you betrayed me you would have left me for dead sold me into slavery all of these things they're in his mind he hasn't forgotten them you minute to me for evil oh but look where we are today the scene has been reversed our positions have been reversed I'm no longer the one vulnerable I'm no longer the one depending on you for my life he must have been thinking now you're depending on me for your life you meant it to me for evil but God meant it to me for good oh this excites me I have to be honest this thrills me this encourages me to look at my circumstances differently than I've been looking at them even in the past and it's easy it's easy to look at one set of circumstances from Heaven's perspective and then another set of circumstances in your life from Earth's perspective from the perspective of the mind and the will and the emotions so we've got to bring ourselves together so to speak we've got to come into agreement how are we going to look at our circumstances this year how are we going to live our lives are we going to choose to make the effort I'm telling you it's not automatic it doesn't fall on you you're going to have to choose and you're gonna have to reinforce that choice by continuing to choose I want the Christ's life I want the virtue of Jesus Christ to live in my body to give me strength to give me power to live above sin to live above unbelief and to point people to the only truth that can transform and that's the gospel the revelation of Jesus Christ it's amazing to me how the enemy is moving not in the world but in the in the minds of Christians how he so desires to cause you and I to live way below our means but it's time for a redo it's time to start over that's the one thing that I'd like to say to you today about serving God if you fail you don't lay there in your failure wallowing around in self-pity you've got to rise up you've got to let God be God again in your life let him move in your family again let him move in your church again don't be critical by what you see decide that with God's help you'll be an agent of change for those around you I believe that God's giving us an opportunity to take sides with his word in 2018 I choose to believe God's infallible word I choose to believe that the Living Word of God the spirit of Jesus Christ is living inside of me I choose to believe that no matter what's going on in the earthly and carnal governments of this world I choose to believe that God wants to give his people governmental authority in the spirit I believe that the bride of Jesus Christ in the earth has a very important role to play in standing in the gap we call it in intercessory prayer in moving forward to know the mind of God in the will of God and the desires of God before they become perhaps plain to those around us he's looking for forerunners he's looking for those who will give everything every part of their life to him surrender every bit of it to him and then watch him take those pieces even the broken pieces of our life and mend them put them back together for greater purposes I know that you may be discouraged I know that you may have been at the point of giving up at many times in your life I tell you I've been there I've been serving the Lord since I was 7 years old when he baptized me with the Holy Ghost and fire I've given in my entire life I've had some gains and I've had some losses I've had some successes and I've had some failures but I just want to give you this testimony he is still Lord he is still good he is still real he is still faithful and he's as dear to you right now as you will allow him to be our lives get crowded especially in the time we're living in now technology has a way of filling up our lives problems seek to consume us but if you make some room for Jesus Christ today if you make some room for the presence of the Lord he'll come you invite him you make room for him when he comes wash his feet with your tears pour your heart of love upon him tell him you're so glad that he came don't leave him in the corner with dirty feet look at things from a higher vantage point in this hour there's authority that God wants to release in your life to speak words of truth that not that they don't fall on deaf ears they accomplish things in the realm of the Spirit whether we immediately see results in the natural or not things are shifted in the spirit realm I believe that what this little woman did that day shifted some things in the spirit realm I believe it gave the disciples an opportunity to get a good look at their heart I wonder how embarrassed they felt when Jesus discerning what they were murmuring about spoke to them and what he had to say was very different from how they had discerned the scene that had just unfolded I wonder how embarrassed we would feel right now if we indeed found out that God is looking at what's happening in our life right now from a very different point of view than the one we've been looking at it with I said a moment ago let this be a year of of the reduce of doing it over recently when we were talking together I named I read a ton of of words with the prefix REE to do again to restart to rebuild to recover to refresh to realign I just prophesied to you right now that if you will surrender your heart again to God if you will surrender your thoughts again to God if you will refuse to continue to think the thoughts that the enemy is feeding you with a spoon how do I know are they contrary to God's Word if if you're if in your inner being you have decided that you'll never be able to accomplish anything for God that he's through with you that he's forgotten you that he's I tell you that's a lie that's how you can know because that's not what God's Word said God's Word very generally speaks I mean it's speaking to a lot of people because we don't know who's gonna read the scripture but but the word of the Lord says I've got good plans I've got good thoughts about you I want to do things in your life I tell you I believe in divine appointments I know that that sometimes people are just you know they get sore in their thumb they get tendinitis in their thumb because they're just sitting in front of the television with the remote control just switching switching switching switching sports on what 300 channels reality television that's not reality you know soap operas that we sometimes call slop operas there's so much to see there's so much entertainment out there and some of it vulgar and filthy even some of Christian television is not exactly presenting the gospel of Jesus Christ but I happen to believe that God makes divine appointments with people I happen to believe that you may think you're in control of the remote and you may find out one day that God is in control that he brought you to this moment right now that you're sitting in front of this television or in front of your computer watching this program right now because it's you that the Spirit of God is reaching for right now it's you that God wants to restore and bring into realignment perhaps it's you that God wants to give you a new beginning in 2018 then quit disqualifying yourself and allow God to be God in your life make up your mind that you're not going to just call him Lord you're gonna make him Lord you're going to serve Him you're going to reject the life of oppression and hopelessness and you're going to receive that supernatural life that we talked about yes angels are real yes demons are real yes principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in high places it's real the presence of God in someone's life it's real there is a supernatural life there is a greater and a higher life than just everyday natural living I don't know how some people make it with all of the circumstances they have to go through in life with all the addictions and all of the oppression and bondage that some people are living with I don't know how they survive in fact I'll just be honest if you don't have Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior I don't know how you get out of bed every morning but I've got good news for you he wants to be your Lord he wants to be your Savior he wants to be your encourage err I don't know what your position is right now I don't know you by name I don't know your street address but I know the one who does I know the one who has those divine appointments and and who knows how to make those connections I just want to prophesy to somebody right now that means proclaim the truth I just want to proclaim the truth to somebody right now that God ABB's solutely has the power the ability the desire and the will to bring some of those seeds that have been planted in your life through the years that have never come to full harvest he has the ability the power to bring those things up out of the ground not just sprouting but flourishing this year if you can reconnect yourself with the vision maybe something you gave up on a long time ago I don't know what it was I don't know what kind of ministry it was that God was calling you to I don't know what kind of desire maybe there were simple desire maybe you just wanted a good companion in life you wanted to raise your children to serve God to love the Lord and to point people to the work of the Cross and things got really messed up in a hurry well I want you to know that God knows how to bring those things to pass in your life even now sometimes we make dreams and we make plans for our life and they don't always come together but if we can discover God's dreams what does God dream for me what what is his desire for me in this hour how would he desire to use me in the end time that's what we need to know father I thank you today for divine appointments with each and every person that's watching this program maybe some would even watch it to mark but I thank you Lord that with even even with those I thank you for a divine appointment because perhaps even in this moment you want to reach that one you want to penetrate the darkness of that one and I'm asking you to do that right now I'm asking you to revive and restore and renew and refresh the discouraged people of God watching this program I'm asking you Lord for those who once knew you and have been so disconnected from you for years almost given up on walking with you I pray Lord right now that you would bring a preciousness of your presence a conviction of your spirit into their life right now and they would once again surrendered submit and yield their lives to you for the glory of God I ask you to heal the sick and to move by your presence into that home right now or wherever they're watching this program Oh God thank you that you are still the Living God and you change not we ask you to do these things according to the promise of your word and in the holy name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah our Savior amen and amen God is God and God is good would you call us would you let us know what's happening in your life right now what's God doing for you right now in this moment as you have watched this program what's he putting his finger on in your life we'd like to know we'd like to covenant with you in prayer we'd like to stand with you in faith that God will continue to bring about great and glorious things in your life I I encourage you right now forget about the old forget about 2017 it's a new day to serve the Lord it's a new year I want God to be God in my life and in my everyday circumstances if through the course of this day you find your thoughts going back to the lives of the enemy pull those thoughts down force them to be submissive to what God's Word has said about you we love you that's why we're here we want to be a blessing I'm so thankful for the gospel channel allowing us to have this time with you god bless you bye-bye [Music]
