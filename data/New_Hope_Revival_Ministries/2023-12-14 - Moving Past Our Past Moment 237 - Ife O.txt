TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and although you and I are not fighting a physical battle like that we're really fighting a spiritual battle like that for our own for our own Victory to stay in this thing just to stay on top of the heartache to stay on top of the past to move past the past so that we can see what God will do for us now and I don't care how dark it was I don't care how black it was how hideous it was you were not alone you may have felt alone I may have felt alone but way before the foundation of the world God knew you and he saw your choice and he was determined come on you might be knocked down for your own poor choices at times and you might suffer for things that you're not guilty of at times but he determined them to stay close enough to you and protect you and keep you so that in the right hour in the very right moment of time in God 's appointed and alloted time you would come to him and this time you wouldn't hold part of your heart back you wouldn't hold part of your hurt back but you would come and lay all of it The Good the Bad and the Ugly I lay it on the Altar and I say God if you can get Glory out of this mess I'm not just inviting you I'm imploring you to come and get Glory out of the mess of my life hasn't he began that work for most of us don't we have something to praise him for are we what we ought to be probably not are we what we'd like to be probably not but thank God we're not what we used to be because we've allowed the Holy Spirit to help move us past our past it didn't come to stay it came to pass in The Darkest Hour in in the most awful pain of your life God's hand was still close enough to you you may have thought you were going under for the last time you may not have recognized the Finger of God pulling you up letting you catch your breath even resuscitating you when you needed it you might not have recognized his grace you might not have recognized his Mercy but I tell you based on the word of God it was there you may not be far enough past it to be able to recognize it I find out we have to get so far past our past before we can really begin to realize you mean that was for my good you had to look like it was for my destruction but we have a Joseph anointing we have a Joseph manle and mandate and what the enemy meant for evil how many of you have ever sung it on a Sunday morning here what the enemy meant for evil but enough of us are moving past our past I want to I like that I'm going to keep saying that enough of us are moving past our past that we're able to create an atmosphere and that's all God's looking for he said I want a house to live in
