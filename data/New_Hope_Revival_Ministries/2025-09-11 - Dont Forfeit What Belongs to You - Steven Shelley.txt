Description:
The Word reminds us: “If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land.” Our inheritance is not meant to sit untouched—it is to be lived in, walked in, and occupied with authority.

Yes, the struggles of life are real—anxiety, heaviness, stress—but they are not the end of your story. You are called higher. This is the hour to put away childish things and rise in maturity, led by His Spirit.

The King of your life declares: “It’s time to reign.” Don’t surrender your inheritance. Step into the promise and walk in the authority Christ has given you.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
your spiritual inheritance, &gt;&gt; you'll eat it. &gt;&gt; If you be &gt;&gt; willing &gt;&gt; and obedient, I know we know this, but if you be willing and obedient, &gt;&gt; both &gt;&gt; conjunction and willing and willing and obedient. Ye shall eat the good of the promise, &gt;&gt; the good of the land. You will eat it because you have occupied it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You will occupy your promise. You will live in and on your promise if you be willing and obedient. &gt;&gt; You shall be the beneficiary &gt;&gt; of the promise. &gt;&gt; Woo. Not only will you possess, you will have strength, power, and authority to dispossess &gt;&gt; what is squatting &gt;&gt; on your inheritance. &gt;&gt; The devil refuses to budge many times until you address him with the authority that's given to you as a part. You're a part of God. You're a part of the very creator, the very one who created him. &gt;&gt; And when you use bridal authority, the authority of an adopted son, a fully adopted son, a whos, not a tetanon, not a toddler, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; But a man, &gt;&gt; when I became a man, I put away &gt;&gt; childish things. I want to tell you as your pastor this morning, it's well past the time &gt;&gt; for us to put away childish things. &gt;&gt; The ministry of Jesus was such that he said about his own ministry, I can do nothing &gt;&gt; except it's revealed to me &gt;&gt; of my father. &gt;&gt; That doesn't make a trinity. Come on. &gt;&gt; It puts a body on an eternal spirit. &gt;&gt; Now he's got a body. &gt;&gt; Not just a theophony, but now he has a body. He's not just a rainbow. He's not just a pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; He He has a body. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "I can't do anything of my own. I must do what I see him, what I hear from him, what is revealed to me from him." that's what I must do. And uh you might understand that because he's he's telling us in a in a slight paraphrase here, he's telling us it's by vision. &gt;&gt; And as long as he was willing and obedient, &gt;&gt; the the vision was fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Well, if we're becoming one with him, &gt;&gt; come on now. &gt;&gt; It may not be a picture that flashes. It may just be a knowing that breaks forth in your heart &gt;&gt; and you say, "Yeah, this is the one I want to invest in." &gt;&gt; We got to be led in this hour. Lots of wisdom, &gt;&gt; uh, lots of maturity. &gt;&gt; That means some of us are going to have to have great change. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. You'll learn eventually, but it better be quick because you're being called on to be willing &gt;&gt; and obedient. If if there's any tone, if you sense a tone in me this morning that would make you think that I am uh not uh legitimizing, I am legitimizing all of your anxiety and your stress and your heartache and your burden and your emotion and your depression and your heaviness. It's so it's real. It's not a fantasy. But what I can't do &gt;&gt; is celebrate it. &gt;&gt; You don't need somebody else to celebrate it. &gt;&gt; You need somebody else to show you how to get out of it. &gt;&gt; This is the road map out. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You'll stay there as long as you're trying to figure out how to change people around you. You'll stay depressed. &gt;&gt; You'll stay in that. But once you make up your mind, I don't care. I can't help. I can't help that. I can't help that. I can't do that. I don't know how to fix that. But I've got to get myself up out of the valley of despair. I've got to pull myself up. There's a king in my castle &gt;&gt; who says it's time to rule and reign with authority in your life. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to forfeit anything that belongs to me.
