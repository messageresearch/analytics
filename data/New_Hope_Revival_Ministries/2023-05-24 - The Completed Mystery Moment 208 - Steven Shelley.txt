TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] foreign we have to say there's something yet in that mystery of God that has not yet been completely made known now I believe a portion of that is what I have just quoted to you a moment ago that that the mystery of God is revealed in Christ Christ is the mystery of God and I believe that a portion of the rest of that that the mystery of Christ is revealed in the bride or the bride is the revealing of the mystery of Christ I think that's a key to see this mystery finished let me see if you heard what I'm saying I think that this is a part it's you being able to identify your position in this equation you see there's no doubt in my mind that brother Branham helped us to see clearly that Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new but now I want to ask you who are you who are you brother Brandon asked us at the end of his ministry several times from scripture what house will you build me right one of the last messages what house will you build me so now Christ is looking for a place to live now the church at large teaches that Christ comes to live in US and that's not a great great Revelation there but what is great and what is powerful and what is missing in this hour is he doesn't just come to live in us to make us feel warm and fuzzy he comes to live in us because he wants to burst out of us doing the same things that he did while he was on planet Earth and so he wants to he wants to raise the dead he wants to heal the sick he wants to manifest Deliverance through his bride and that is a fully adopted bride that's coming to maturity right and when she stands in the fullness of her maturity what will you have you will have a mystery of God completely finished a process from the logos remember how he talks about that Fountain of Light that bubbling Fountain of color and he said are you with me and he said out of that Fountain of Light Came to logos so that's the beginning of the mystery right there you see there was a time when God was not God somebody said God is eternal he's Eternal in spirit but not Eternal in office because in order for him to be God in office there has to be something created or something that can recognize who he is and worship him so in the very beginning it was just spirit and light God eternal you you can say father you can say the eternal spirit of the father but in order to manifest that he was the eternal spirit of the father he had to birth something he had to create something do you understand where I'm going so the mystery of God started before the foundation of the world and the Mystery of God will be finished at the end of the laodicean church age it took all seven Church ages for this mystery of God to be finished Paul was a part of it iranius and March and Luther and Wesley these were all apart in finishing the mystery of God one of these days it's going to be finished in you and it's not going to be you anymore but it's going to be he who is who has possessed you see the whole concept of demon possession is an end to type for something that's great and real and that is a people that are fully possessed by God you see that Old Demon is what he always is an imitator an impersonator and he tries to control people with evil but there's going to be a fully adopted manifested bride she will come forth in the last of the last days he will have the saith the Lord and without the saith the Lord Brother Adam said she will keep her peace she won't speak without no saith the Lord because she's going to be so fully surrendered to him [Music] foreign [Music]
