Description:
Your election is secure. However, it is possible to allow a series of bad choices to pull you into a lying perception where you’re walking in the permissive will of God. The good news is, it can end right now. You can let the Word correct the timing, the imbalances of your decisions and bring you right back into the “good and acceptable and perfect will of God” in all things.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
even though we have a pre-planned design there are times that we're right on the mark there are times that we are not right on the i mark you to know many of us have individual promises that have been given to us that are because of our destiny because of the call that is on our life we have promises that are directly connected to the destiny to the plan to the path that is set before us and so we're all working toward an ultimate promise but we're all moving toward spiritual promises that pertain to our lives even though we have a pre-planned design there are times that we're right on the mark there are times that we are not right on the mark there are no variables concerning our election now listen if our choices and levels of surrender can have significant impact on our growth and our fruitfulness in a particular season it is essential that we discover the perfect will of god in all things i want you to say in all things you can have his acceptable will which can be permissive and not have his perfect will but the writer tells us it's possible to have his good acceptable and perfect will how many of you want to live in that god help us to live in the good and acceptable and perfect will of god that word perfect here is is translated from a greek word that means having the highest standard how many of you believe that what god has written in that book is based on his original thoughts about you and that is the highest standard of his will substituting what god will allow instead of what he prefers can cause someone to think or to make it seem like they have fallen short of reaching the promise so it becomes easy to throw in the towel with an i blew it attitude if the enemy can make it look like i have failed again then i may end up making another bad spiritual decision and another and another and another and another and i've been doing all of that based on what seemed to be the case i want you to know that finding yourself in the permissive will of god does not mean that you have come short of reaching the promise [Music] the enemy will make it seem impossible for you to have the promise and spiritually we make some bad decisions in a series of bad decisions and then people start losing confidence and they start pulling away and going in all kinds of different directions and doing all kinds of things and it's all based on a perception that is not the truth it's not what the word said it's a lie so i realize that if the enemy can cause you to feel that you have come so short of the promise that you can hardly get your eye on the end he doesn't have to do anything else to you the little bride of jesus christ she may have wondered she may have gone around the mountain a time or two she may have allowed her decision to force her into the permissive will of god but i want you to know it can end living in the permissive will can end another trip around the mountain can end you can choose to come to kadesh barnea today let the word set it straight in your life let the word correct the imbalance in your life let the word correct the timing in your life i don't care what it seems like but don't you ever think that you have changed your election or your predestination or your justification if god has settled it it is set out it may seem you have fallen short but you don't have to fall short because you have believed
