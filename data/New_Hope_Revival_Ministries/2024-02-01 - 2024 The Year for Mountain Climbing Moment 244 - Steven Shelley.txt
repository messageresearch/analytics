Description:
I had an experience with the Lord at the end of 2023, during which it was revealed that the Year 2024 would be a year for mountain climbing. I was instructed to be very sure-footed and was given five instructions on how to achieve this. Three of them were:

1. Keep your balance in the scripture.
2. Whatever you do, stay in the middle of the road.
3. Praise ... until the spirit of worship comes. Worship ... until the glory comes. Then ... stand in the glory."

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
on December the 22nd of last year I had an experience with the Lord in the night and in that experience I was told that this was a year 2024 on the Gregorian calendar a year for mountain climbing well I like that it's not always positive what we hear sometimes it's a little bit you know brace yourself but but I think mountain climbing sounds good are you with me and then the voice spoke and said be very surefooted you got to know where you're standing somebody help me you've got to know what you're standing on every now and again you better check the foundation make sure you're still standing on the word it's not OP pinion that we're going to stand on in this hour come on it's not the doctrines of men but we're going to stand on the whole revelation of Jesus Christ did you know that Genesis to revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ he's revealed in Genesis just like he is in the book of the Revelation he is there and he's not just a historical god of the book but he's a living reality in the heart of the believer in this hour I ask a question in this experience how will we remain surefooted I need some help how do we do that and I heard five statements being made and in those statements I heard them in the voice of the person who had spoke these things into my life the first voice I heard was a mentor of mine a man that I respected very much who has gone to be with the Lord so many years ago now and he was speaking back something that had been poured into his life and the phrase was whatever you do keep your balance in the scriptures I don't know any better at VI than that we can't get off on some tangent somewhere we've got to bring the balance amen and and if it's in the book it's true are you with me if it's in the Bible it's true but you don't want to build a big Doctrine on an isolated few words you want to run it through the continuity of the Bible come on now you want to run it all the way through as the old preacher said from kiver to kiver that's from cover to cover and when you do that you've got a Doctrine to stand on Amen and and sometimes we make too many assumptions by what we read you don't have to make any assumptions from scripture when he the spirit has come he will lead you and guide you when the spirit of Truth has showed up in your life he will help you to make your way through traditions on but I have a mandate and you have a mandate in this hour keep your balance in the word in the scriptures then the second thing I heard was a from a great man of God who had one of the most impactful Ministries that this nation and around the world really has ever seen and that was a a healing evangelist I believe more than a healing evangelist but a prophet and uh his name was brother brandham and I heard the voice of brother brandom because his ministry has spoken to me so much through the years I heard his voice very clearly saying whatever you do stay in the middle of the road that's the highest point that's right if the road is made properly it's higher in the middle and it it it Slants slightly toward the edges so that all the debris Will Will just sort of come floating down when a good rain like we've had lately just washes not I tell you to wash a gully right down your driveway won't it the kind of rain that we been having and then the third voice happened to be a woman that had some influence in my life and and as I've told you before God sent me many years ago and said I will give you a word for her and I will give her a word for you you do believe in Prophecy don't you we are still living in the New Testament and uh so her name was Ruth Hein some of you may have heard of sister Ruth I've quoted her many times and uh she she was a missionary and uh she did a tremendous work in the nations of the world she was the third voice that I heard in this experience and if you've ever heard her voice you'll never forget it she had one of the most unique voices that I've ever heard in my life and uh she she spoke in this in this experience something that I had actually heard her say and had read in a book uh the first book I ever read that that she wrote and and and it's part of how God is helping us to remain surefooted in this area praise and worship is a very important part of keeping our balance of staying in the middle of the road and of keeping the channel of Revelation open between Papa and our hearts do you understand uh so she simply said praise until the spirit of worship comes worship until the glory gory comes and then do what stand Glory stand in the glory
