TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] last night I had the most simple dream um no profound Revelation just a real personal encouragement to me and maybe it would encourage you but I'm not going to tell you the dream I'm just going to tell you a portion of the dream brother brandom walked up to where I was in this dream in the garden and he walked up behind me and he said hello there I turned around recognized his voice and I said why brother brandom I wasn't expecting you to see you here today and he said I've come to sing you a song and in that dream I felt so guilty because I have been known to say that Brandon was not a great singer but when he sung he sung with his whole heart and it was anointed every time I say that brother westes looks at me cross-eyed usually because he said well he wasn't that bad it's not that he wasn't that I think he was a bad singer It's just sometimes he he could catch a song at the end and sing a whole verse in another key from what the piano player was and he never slowed down most of us would would kind of you know I no I'm not but he just because he was singing from his heart and so I felt so guilty in the dream all the times I'd said that I'd said it in a not an ugly way at all but or an unkind way but I felt so guilty here's brother brandom come to sing me a song and here I have said he wasn't a great singer and I just dropped my head like that and he said a few things to me and after he did he said now I'm going to sing You the song and far as I know I've never heard brother brandham sing this song I looked on the tape search this morning I've never heard him sing this song but I'm going to tell you in a moment after we sing it why I think he sung it to me in this dream and uh if you know this the words to this you can help me it's not maybe the easiest song for me to sing but just listen to the word words there was no music and he did beautiful by the way much better than I'll do now there's glory in my soul since Jesus took control he plac within my heart a happy song The Joy Bells sweetly sing while I his love I sing press on it won't be very long do you remember it now sing the chorus press s it won't be very long not long until we reach that land of [Music] song in heaven some sweet day I'm going there to stay press on it won't be V very [Music] long he FS my way with cheer with him I have no fear he guides my weary steps along the [Music] way I'm glad he promised me a Manion full and free press on it won't be very long I wish you could have seen his expression press on it won't be there long not long until we reach that land of [Music] song in heaven some sweet day I'm going there to stay press on it won't be very long the last verse listen in heaven I am told the streets are purest gold oh what a lovely place to make my [Music] home United there will be Will shout the victory press on it won't be [Music] very long sing it to your neighbor sing it out if you would press home it won't be very long not long until we reach that land of song Oh in heaven some sweet day I'm going there to stay press on it won't let's stand stand and sing it with me before we let the musicians go down press on Church press it won't be very long not long until we reach that land of song Praise His Name in heaven some sweet day I'm going there to stay if circumstances have you pressed down if what's going on in our nation and in our world worries you are burdens you let this be your song or Anthem press on it won't be [Music] very long just keep your eyes on the Lord and press on until we reach that land of song it'll be a reality then in heaven some sweet day I'm going there to stay press on it won't be very long would you look at your neighbor and tell them press on press on it won't be there very long not long until we reach that land of song now in heaven some sweet day I'm going there to stay PR W be very long when I got over to the church this morning thank you musicians I started asking the Lord because it was so much on my mind when I woke up this morning I don't know when I've ever heard that song it's been years again I couldn't find where brother Brandon was singing it ever on a tape or anything like that and I just prayed Lord would would you show me why you you have in the past dealt with me would you show me why you would have let me dream such a dream I didn't go to bed thinking about brother brandom why would I have such a dream and the thought came to me well let me just see if if I can't find where he sung the song let me see how many times he said press on I thought that'd be a good place to look and just over and over and over again he'd say it it's a it's an expression he used but as I began to read through those quotations of him saying press on I hit the target and I want to share that with you in just a moment the Lord let me know without a shadow of a doubt that's why I had the dream that I had maybe it was just for me but it could encourage you as well let me read a couple things to you before we get to what I feel like is the reason why in a little message called expectation he said let us put our shoulders and arms together and press on to try to make a a a little better life for the people we're sojourning with if there's not selfish motive then that's the attitude I'm sure we would take isn't that nice press on and make life a little better for the people we're sojourning with then another uh mention of press on in looking at the Unseen he said I'm told by aviators who fly these real fast jet planes and they say that the plane will get up to a certain speed and it vibrates and shakes it seems like the bolts are going to fly out of it and the wings are going to come off until they pass the sound barrier but he said once they pass the sound barrier they say the the plane just sails out in ease he said that's an obstacle that's in the way of that plane when it passes its own sound barrier and then it runs at ease oh he said if the Church of this day could ever pray till they pass the sin barrier and the unbelief barrier isin't that good they could shout the victory of a living God when they once passed that barrier by looking to the Unseen and instead of the scene and letting the world vibrate and do whatever it wants to do he said there's a living God and when we lose our disbelief and unbelief in him and pass that barrier he said the world is saying the days of Miracles are passed it'll make you shake there's no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll make you wonder but if you'll just look at the Unseen to The God Who promised it or the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call if you look to the Blessed word that says Jesus Christ it's the same yesterday today and forever and turn your heads towards that and press on until you past that vibration past the unbelief barrier and the sin barrier and all the barriers that seem to hinder you then you'll fly free in the faith of God knowing that all things are possible there is no limit they say hardly to the speed of the plane then if there's no limit to how it can go there's no limit to the blessings that God will pour down upon a believer that will believe how many of you'd like to know that you're pressing beyond the sin barrier pressing beyond the unbelief barrier until you find that place where there's no more vibration to hold you back you know you you come to that place where things start shaking around it would be human nature to back off wouldn't it you you'd back off the accelerator if you're driving a car or something something started shaking like that you your tendency would be to back off but brother Brandon was encouraging us to press on and then I don't know why I didn't think of this because I just shared this with you a year ago and I don't know why it didn't come to me the way it did but maybe two years ago but if you remember I told you again about brother brandom's experience beyond the curtain of time and what a lot of people forget is that it didn't come to brother brandham at a very high moment in his life it came to him in a very discouraged moment a place where his faith was weak and his mind was tired and in fact it came in a time when he needed to be encouraged to do what to press on and there are many tellings of this and and this is not the bestelling but it's the one I could grab it's the first time he told it and it's the one I could grab this morning for you and I'll I'll just read it although it take me a few minutes to do it the other morning about I kept hearing something he said we go to church at 9:30 and I raised up and I looked over at the wife and she was sleeping well just got the studying about that I I kept hearing something say press on just keep pressing on I said well I'm 50 years old I've got to do something for the Lord that's pretty encouraging to me he had certainly accomplished a whole lot in his ministry but he wasn't feeling like that he said I haven't done nothing yet he put me my life here and anyone knows that something happened to me he said I was a Cocker and he made a wheat out of me I don't know how it ever come what Can I Do Lord I said I'm 50 years old my days are numbered I haven't got very much longer to stay people laughed they chuckled but he knew something they didn't know wasn't because he was 50 it's because he was facing a death that would seem untimely I'm 50 years old my days are numbered I haven't got very much longer to stay what can I do how can I do something for you and The Voice voice answered press on now remember friends here lays my Bible if I'm a fanatic I don't know it I don't know nothing about it I believe my heart's with God I believe he's proved that before you I may be wrong in some things but it's unconsciously wrong when when uh I was thinking about that I kept hearing something say again press on I said who is that it must be my wife I said said what did you say honey she never moved I shook her I said MAA he probably said mey she said uh she was sleeping well and I said well it wasn't her I listened again and it said keep pressing on now I know Visions this could have been a vision if it was I never had one just like it I said maybe it's me saying it cause one time I was all burdened and distress going to a meeting I knelt down on the floor praying to get a burden off of me I heard someone stand at the door rattling off something in German or something well I wonder who that is I slipped up I couldn't see no one well where's that coming from it was me speaking myself I just held real still until it finished up and that's when the woman you know that was healed she was laying on the side of a road bleeding to death a half hour farther she was there perfectly normal and well the Holy Spirit made intercessions powerful he said thought maybe it would me it was me saying keep pressing on so I put my finger over my mouth like this and I heard it say keep pressing on pressing on I said who are you that's talking to me who's in this room and that's the way it comes just like Visions this is real just a voice just the same as you hear mine keep pressing on and I said keep pressing on said the great reward is just ahead I said you mean I pass the curtain he said yes would you like to see it I said I would here's what he said listen to this would you like to see it brother brandom answered I would it would help me if I could just see it and something happened I felt myself leaving this body now I never had a vision like that I'm looking back seeing myself laying there leaning up against the headboard of the bed with my hands up like this and I looked at myself and I thought I'm dying and I started moving out and the first thing you know I come into a little place that kindly set something like that and as soon as I got there here come thousands of people and everyone looking young now I'm in a mixed multitude and I'm your brother and you watch I say this in the name of the Lord you'll each meet there if you'll be right but these young girls coming to me throwing their arms around me and hollering my precious brother now look when I was a sinner never run around I wasn't Army to run around with women I don't care how saintly a man tries to live how Godly lives if a woman puts her arm around a man it's a human sensation he said now you just well to know that you're still a human just exactly right the power of God can keep you and go on but he said here come people just throwing he was letting you know that that was not something normal that for him to let sisters put their arms around him he said' but here they kept throwing their arms around me saying my precious brother and all them women had long hair white garments barefooted they were young looked to be about 18 years old maybe 20 they'd grab me and throw their arms around me and say our precious brother and hug me like that and then walk away and somebody else I seen my first wife come up now she died when she was about 22 she hadn't changed a bit she' Come Running I said surely she'll call me my husband and she walked up and began smiling threw arms around me she said my darling brother then she hugged some of the women that had just hugged me and here come men looked like they were uh had hair down their shoulder they were nicest looking people I'd ever seen Starry pearly white teeth they were throwing their arms around me and saying our precious brother and one of them hollered at one and said he's arrived he's arrived at last and I thought have I died and I've come to glory is this it I thought it couldn't be and I looked in that voice that had spoke to me down in my room I heard it again I looked back I saw myself lying there on the bed I never had anything like that happen it's done something to me I can never be the same no more I thought what is this well all them people look young I look down and I was young I had turned back to a young man again well this is strange I can't explain it there's no words that I can think of I'd say superb or supreme or perfect that wouldn't touch it there was no tomorrow there was no yesterday they were we were in eternity and they never got tired they never had to eat yes they had senses I could feel them they could speak they were looking at me I don't understand this I said listen and the voice said this is what you remember this is perfect love said isn't that what you spoke the Holy Spirit was I said yes and this is perfect love and about that time a big bunch of men lifted me up and took me to a place and set me up kind of high like a stand or something and there here was people I could see them by the tens of thousands coming from everywhere every one young beautiful running hugging me I said well I don't get this and just in a beautiful young woman ran up she said Oh My Darling brother we're so happy to see you welcome she walked away and said I said praise the Lord sister I looked around me and I thought what is this what's going on then a voice spoke and said in the Bible where it said that Jacob was gathered with his people and the other one that is like to that where you'll gather with your people I said are all these Broms I never believ that was that many he said they're not brandom's they're your converts they're the that woman that you're admiring you know how old she was when you led her to Christ I said I have no idea past 90 see she's young forever Hallelujah she looked up at me and said brother brandom Jesus will come someday and we'll go back to Earth Earth and we'll receive our glorified body then we'll live together forever I said well what do you set me up here like this for and she said they said you was our leader you led us oh let me see Jesus if I've passed over I said I want to see him and the voice said you can't see him now he'll come but first we he will come to you I said judge you by the gospel you preached and I said the gospel I preach yes I said will St Paul have to stand before his converts absolutely he will too I said I never varied one word I stayed just exactly the way the Bible said it I don't care what anyone said I stayed right with it like that so if Paul's group is saved mine will be too and a great scream formed looked like thousands and thousands said we know that praise God I never was so happy that I stayed true to the word I never was so happy when he told that later he said that voices screamed out we're counting on that or we're resting on that and this is what brother carer mentioned here Tuesday night years ago I I looked and I used to have an old hunting dog his name was Fritz and he was half airdale is that how you say that and half newfinland he was a great big dog and he used to go with me everywhere I'd go hunting and the best old thing I'd ever had he'd lay with me putting uh he'd put me in school clothes from hunting Tre and possums and skunks and whatever more I trapped and he just kept me in school clothes and I'd leave him anywhere he'd find his way home he would sell those skins for to buy school clothes and one day when he moved into the city a policeman came by and throwed a dog button in the yard and killed him when I come home and buried him I was just about 16 17 years old I padded the last bit of dirt on there and I said Fritz I'll kill that man for doing at I went in the house and got my rifle and started down to the police station to get him and when I got on the road little old Ford run up behind me it was my father he grabbed that rifle out of my hand he was a little bitty man slapped me upside the head and said get in the car brother Bram was telling it all wasn't he and I went back and I said Fritz I went up to his grave Fritz here's what I will if pop won't let me do it that way I'll find him on the street someday I'll lose control of my car I promise you I'll get even with him for killing you about a year after that brother brandom said I was saved and I led that man to God and buried him after he was saved Mr short was his name my old dog was gone I always thought after I was saved wonder when I get over there if I'll see old Fritz and while I was sitting there I looked coming down across that Hill here come old Fritz coming up to me me and he was just licking his tongue you know and panting like that and I look coming behind him and here come old Prince my saddle horse and he ran up to me and put his neck around me over like that oh God what is this just then a voice spoke all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you God has given to you we're all here together oh my heart melted within me all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you is gathered here with you to meet God I said oh praise be to God and about that time I felt myself moving I said I don't have to go back do I and I was back here at the bed again friend death does not change a man it just changes your dwelling place I've got a wife very sweet wife sitting here three little children two little girls little boy I want to live for them but my first purpose in life is to live for Christ Christ and for my Ministry the second I'd like to live long enough that I could see my little Joseph sitting there become a minister I want to hand this Bible to him don't you compromise on one word stay true to God if it takes everything there is you stay true to the word and he goes on listen friends wherever that is it isn't one breath between us and there tonight with all my heart this is the first time I've ever told this outside of my own church with all my heart by the grace of God that's right this was in Chicago Ohio by the grace of God with all I could do I promise God I'll pull every soul if I have to make it and compel and everything else to come to Jesus for what a time that was when those people those bright-eyed women and men standing their arms screaming my darling brother I know that my Ministry had been the cause of them being there God help me forever to win souls for Christ is my prayer and he closed it and let us pray I believe the reason why brother Brandon walked up to me that way in the dream and said I want to sing you a song that caught me off guard and he started singing press on it won't be very long not long until we reach that land of song I think it was an encouragement to say no matter what you feel no matter what you're facing you can press on past that sin barrier that unb belief barrier that stress barrier we didn't used to know what stress was did we we never heard the word before we just we just called it life our grandparents just called it living we call it stress I don't care what you're going through today how bad it looks it's not as bad as it looks I'll tell you that right now not as bad as it looks and it may feel like it's forever but I tell you this too shall pass and God couldn't done anything I can't think of anything more that he could have done or or of a different nature to encourage me personally than by letting me see brother brandom that way just singing although I felt awful terrible about saying what I've said about his singing Lord help me not to say that again because I he can sing to me any time in a dream or or Vision or whatever because it's certainly encouraging to know now you just can you know let that pass from your mind it may not be for you anyway but I'm thankful for it and I'm going to press on by the help and the grace of God [Music]
