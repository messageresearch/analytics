[0:00] the god of the Breakthrough by Al
[0:03] parisim has walked into the room
[0:10] [Music]
[0:12] if God is saying to us you should watch
[0:16] and recognize the supernatural among you
[0:20] I'm going to move among you in
[0:22] Supernatural ways in 2023 then you and I
[0:26] have to work today on our expectation
[0:30] we have to raise the level of our
[0:33] expectation and we must recognize that
[0:37] anything is possible when God is moving
[0:40] in our lives I want you to know God is
[0:44] not limited by anything but truth
[0:48] and and he is able to do whatever he
[0:51] needs to do
[0:54] find even the laws that he set in place
[0:57] in nature
[0:59] how many of you believe that
[1:01] gravity is in God's control
[1:04] and the rotation of the earth and all
[1:07] that we understand in the universe is
[1:10] all in God's control if he wants to make
[1:13] iron swim
[1:15] he doesn't have to grunt to do it
[1:19] he doesn't have to strain to make iron
[1:21] swim if he wants the dead to live he
[1:24] doesn't have to work up the faith
[1:28] if he wants the blind to see and the
[1:31] death to hear and the dumb to talk
[1:34] if he wants the dumb to shut up
[1:40] I have to work hard to make it happen
[1:43] it's God he's God for natural he's God's
[1:47] Sovereign he's God Supreme now I want
[1:50] you to know right now from the get-go
[1:52] he's called
[1:54] her natural people
[1:57] and that means that you and I are also
[2:00] to be able to do above
[2:05] and Beyond what looks like natural
[2:08] there's gonna be a people
[2:11] in preparation now she's been worked on
[2:15] now
[2:16] she's having religion trimmed off of her
[2:19] now
[2:21] hang her legalism the way
[2:25] now she's running to the absolute of the
[2:28] word she's building a people God is
[2:31] building a people that will take God at
[2:34] his word
[2:37] we're supposed to be the Fulfillment of
[2:40] what the little bride looks like
[2:42] acts like
[2:45] we often say this we don't know what
[2:47] it's going to look like well we we do
[2:49] we do know what it's going to look like
[2:51] it's going to look just like the book of
[2:54] Acts love
[2:55] these signs shall follow them that
[2:56] believe in my name they shall cast out
[2:58] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[2:59] they shall take up serpents if they
[3:01] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[3:02] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[3:04] and they shall recover does anybody
[3:06] still believe that's the Mandate for
[3:07] this hour
[3:09] it has not changed because there's
[3:11] nothing like a Supernatural season to
[3:14] bring forth the suddenlies of God and
[3:16] you know what I like about the
[3:18] suddenlies they happen suddenly
[3:19] [Music]
[3:21] after all the years of waiting and
[3:23] fasting and logging and praying and all
[3:26] of a sudden the season changes and God
[3:29] just steps on the sea boom
[3:31] [Music]
[3:33] and it's all right overnight the
[3:36] Affliction is gone over
[3:39] the Deliverance has come
[3:41] the god of the Breakthrough by our
[3:44] parents has walked into the room the god
[3:48] of the Breakthrough I feel him the god
[3:51] of the Breakthrough
[3:52] [Applause]
[3:55] Hallelujah
[3:57] breakthrough for my family Lord
[4:00] breakthrough for my my body
[4:04] breakthrough for my nerves break through
[4:09] for my blood pressure whatever it is
[4:12] God breaks through
[4:18] our natural people we're living in a
[4:20] supernatural hour
[4:23] we don't want church as usual
[4:27] I wanted to be as unpredictable as
[4:30] possible
[4:31] still glorify the Lord
[4:36] because we don't ever
[4:37] ever but he's going to break out
[4:40] nagging infirmity or whatever it is that
[4:43] has troubled you so long absolutely
[4:46] leave you because your faith has reached
[4:49] a level
[4:51] the realm of the Supernatural is beyond
[4:53] the reach of science it's beyond human
[4:55] explanation it means above and beyond
[4:57] the natural that Supernatural realm is
[5:00] the realm where God operates
[5:02] it is the realm where Heaven and Earth
[5:04] intermingle
[5:06] it is the realm of intersection
[5:09] intersection between God and man when
[5:13] God and man intercept
[5:15] when they have a meeting
[5:19] that meeting is in the realm of the
[5:22] supernatural when you say he touched me
[5:27] did it by reaching from The Unseen Realm
[5:31] impacting you
[5:33] in the realm of the natural
[5:36] God wants his children he wants his
[5:39] bride to live and operate from the realm
[5:44] of the supernatural
