[0:00] [Music]
[0:15] when Adam was created of God he had a
[0:18] perfect Spirit he had a perfect body
[0:22] made in the image of God and he had a
[0:24] perfect Soul there was no struggle in
[0:27] Adam he was God
[0:30] reflected in the earth you want to know
[0:33] what God was like you want to know how
[0:35] God thought you want to know how God
[0:38] operated you could have seen all of that
[0:41] in Adam he had Dominion God gave him
[0:44] Dominion which means Authority and
[0:48] control if he said move it had to move
[0:51] if he said be still it had to stop if
[0:54] Adam would have said to the Moon stop
[0:56] shining it would have had to stop
[0:58] shining eternal life life and Redemption
[1:01] they run together but are not entirely
[1:04] the same thing Adam would have lived
[1:06] forever but he would not have had to be
[1:09] redeemed because he hadn't Fallen he
[1:12] wasn't
[1:13] lost in the same manner the Angels had
[1:16] eternal life they live forever God
[1:20] created them such to do that but they
[1:23] weren't redeemed and that's why one day
[1:25] when the bride the overcoming bride goes
[1:28] home we're going to sing a song that
[1:31] even angels could never sing I don't
[1:34] know what that song is going to sound
[1:36] like but I know it's going to be the
[1:38] song of the Lamb not just the song of
[1:40] Moses but the song of Moses and the song
[1:44] of the Lamb it's going to speak of what
[1:47] God reflected of himself in the older
[1:50] Covenant and what God displayed of
[1:53] himself in the newer Covenant the Lord
[1:55] Jesus Christ when you came here you
[1:57] didn't have the same pure spirit that
[1:59] Adam had had because of what happened in
[2:01] the Garden of Eden man was born with an
[2:03] adamic nature we call it in theology
[2:06] which is a fallen Spirit from the
[2:07] beginning but your spirit having come
[2:10] from the original spirit of God had the
[2:13] potential of being
[2:16] restored
[2:17] transformed transfused by the original
[2:21] spirit of God and brother that's what
[2:24] Redemption is it was never made clear in
[2:27] the older Covenant that God was not just
[2:30] looking to redeem man he was looking to
[2:33] make man
[2:35] Sons sunship is not clearly outlined in
[2:38] the older Covenant and that's why we
[2:42] understand that great is the mystery of
[2:44] God and in the voice of the days in the
[2:47] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[2:49] the mystery of God should be finished
[2:53] mystery and the Bible tells us what that
[2:55] mystery
[2:56] is it's God manifested in flesh flesh he
[3:01] comes first in the revelation of who he
[3:04] is through the
[3:06] word he comes first in
[3:10] presence perusia first he comes by the
[3:15] revelation of the
[3:17] word and when the revelation of the word
[3:20] becomes a living reality in his
[3:23] sons it's what the scripture said as
[3:26] many as are
[3:29] led by the spirit of God they are the
[3:33] sons of God when his word becomes a
[3:36] revelation to
[3:39] us it
[3:42] rewrites it rewrites everything about us
[3:47] that is not in perfect
[3:50] alignment with God I believe that it's
[3:54] not just back to another Pentecost that
[3:57] we're Desiring we think think that's
[4:00] what we need and my we do need another
[4:03] refilling another outpouring another
[4:05] Pentecostal you know blessing yes we all
[4:08] need
[4:09] it but if you had it you'd still have
[4:12] the same old
[4:14] DNA the only thing that's going to
[4:16] satisfy that deep calling to the Deep
[4:21] that's in the spirit of the Bride of
[4:23] Jesus Christ it's when she is restored
[4:27] all the way back to to the original
[4:31] creation the very reason he placed the
[4:34] Tree of Life In the Garden of Eden was
[4:38] not to sustain Adam and Eve it was there
[4:42] to
[4:44] point he was there to point to another
[4:49] [Music]
[4:51] day when man would not only eat the tree
[4:56] of life but he would become one with the
[5:00] Tree of Life when tree becomes
[5:05] one with its branches
[5:08] [Music]
