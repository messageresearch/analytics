[0:00] The the grape doesn't choose itself. It
[0:02] doesn't jump off the vine into the
[0:03] basket and say, "I'm going to be wine."
[0:06] Aren't you glad that's what you've got
[0:08] to remember? I wouldn't have chose me.
[0:14] You wouldn't have chose you in your
[0:16] lowest point in your lowest point. When
[0:20] you see yourself, you'd say, "I would
[0:21] have never chose." Aren't you glad that
[0:25] you didn't do the choosing?
[0:27] In ancient wine- making, the process of
[0:29] refining wine involved carefully pouring
[0:32] from one vessel to another, leaving
[0:34] behind the dregs. When we refuse to be
[0:38] poured from vessel to vessel, when we
[0:41] get comfortable, when we settle in
[0:43] comfort or pride or pain, we take on the
[0:46] aroma of the flesh instead of the
[0:49] fragrance of Christ. The journey starts
[0:53] like this, from vine to vessel. From
[0:58] vessel to vessel,
[1:01] from a final racking vessel to another
[1:06] more honorable vessel. There is an end.
[1:10] There is an end.
[1:12] And that is the more honorable vessel,
[1:14] the chalice of our bridegroom king. But
[1:17] what you have got to do is make sure
[1:21] that you don't get comfortable in the
[1:23] vessel that you're in now. that you
[1:26] don't cry out for more of him. Because
[1:29] if the deep is calling to the deep,
[1:30] guess what that means? It means that
[1:33] there's a deep over there that that is
[1:35] waiting to respond to the call that's in
[1:39] here. If you quit letting the deep cry
[1:42] out to the deep, you'll stay in your in
[1:44] your vessel and you'll and your wine
[1:47] will become bitter and contaminated. So
[1:50] you start crying out to the master. I
[1:52] want to be the wine in your chalice. I I
[1:56] want to be, oh God, like perfume poured
[2:00] on your feet.
[2:02] I I want my eyes to run down with tears
[2:07] so that I can worship you the way that I
[2:10] desire to worship you. The taste of our
[2:14] life when we give ourselves to the king,
[2:16] don't you want him to say, "That's the
[2:18] best my my my that's the best wine I've
[2:21] ever tasted."
[2:22] Don't you want him to uh swirl the
[2:25] bouquet and and say that praise that
[2:28] worship you're giving me is not it's not
[2:31] will worship. It's not it's not
[2:33] conformed praise. It's not following the
[2:36] crowd praise. It's not taking on the
[2:40] spirit of your pastor praise. It's
[2:42] coming from your heart and it and it
[2:45] tastes delicious and it smells amazing.
[2:50] That's the kind of wine we want to
[2:52] become.
[2:54] I cannot afford to settle now. I've got
[2:58] to go all the way. I've got to go all
[3:01] the way until there's no more religion
[3:03] hanging on us. But it's relationship.
[3:08] He's literally crying to his bride in
[3:10] this hour. Let me do it. Amen. Get your
[3:15] hands off, your mind off, your mouth,
[3:20] off the situation, and surrender your
[3:23] will.
[3:25] You don't have to figure it out. You
[3:28] don't have to solve the problem. You
[3:31] just have to get out of the way.
[3:33] Just get out of the way and let him show
[3:36] you how much he loves you. Let him show
[3:39] you that now is the time to seek him
[3:41] because now is the time that he is
[3:44] seeking you. He's no longer seeking you
[3:47] to win you or to draw you to salvation.
[3:51] He's now seeking you for fellowship,
[3:55] for intimacy.
[3:57] It's only in that intimacy that that
[4:00] personal relationship with Jesus Christ
[4:04] behind the veil, the veil drops. He said
[4:08] the world is shut out and you are shut
[4:12] in. You and him, you're in a tent.
[4:17] That's where your your nuptual is sealed
[4:21] symbolically.
[4:24] That's where the tokens of virginity are
[4:26] produced symbolically.
[4:29] Amen. In that place, you can't leave
[4:32] that place the same.
[4:35] You may step in as bride. You leave as
[4:38] wife.
[4:40] Wife carries a different kind of
[4:42] authority
[4:44] than an espouseed bride. The wife can
[4:47] sign her name.
[4:51] Ms. Jesus Christ. And it has the same
[4:55] authority
[4:57] that the bridegroom's name has. It is
[5:00] his name, but it's yours because you're
[5:03] the you're the you're the other part of
[5:05] that.
