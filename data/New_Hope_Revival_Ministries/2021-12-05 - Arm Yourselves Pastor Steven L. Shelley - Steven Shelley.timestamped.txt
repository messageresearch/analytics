[47:42] a part of coming to the house of the
[47:45] lord but we've come to give our lord
[47:48] praise and honor and to receive from his

[49:32] wonderful is our god
[49:34] [Music]
[49:35] bless
[49:37] his holy name
[49:40] praise god
[49:44] you may be seated this morning it is
[49:46] wonderful to see you in the house of the
[49:48] lord we have some missing this morning
[49:50] but you're not
[49:52] and so we want to thank god for you
[49:54] and we're praying for those who are not
[49:56] with us and some have already
[49:59] uh
[50:00] checked in on the stream so that we
[50:02] would know that they are there
[50:04] and we send greetings and love to all of
[50:07] you brother cliff halls especially
[50:10] wanted if it was appropriate he said and
[50:13] i think it is to thank you all for your
[50:15] prayers for him the lord really
[50:18] undertook
[50:20] and he is at home and as many of you
[50:22] know the battle for health is perhaps
[50:26] not over but uh what a major victory he
[50:29] has had so would you give god praise
[50:32] with me let's thank the lord for
[50:34] touching brother cliff halls today
[50:40] uh sister julie his sister and uh
[50:43] also daniel were so good and so faithful
[50:47] and mindful to keep me posted several
[50:50] times a day
[50:51] of his condition and every time we
[50:53] prayed and you know he was really heavy
[50:56] on our hearts and it's very difficult to
[50:58] be so far away and not know anything so
[51:01] they were a real blessing to help us to
[51:04] know what was going on and help us to
[51:07] sort of target our prayers but he has
[51:10] gained the victory by the grace of god
[51:13] now it's been traumatic
[51:15] for that family so we want to lift them
[51:17] all up to the lord
[51:19] benjamin sang this morning thank you
[51:21] lord for your blessings on me the author
[51:23] of that song james madison easter
[51:27] jeff easter if you know the jeff and
[51:29] sherry easter his dad wrote that song
[51:32] with his brothers
[51:33] he is in intensive care
[51:36] uh on a ventilator with
[51:39] uh
[51:40] with kovid and
[51:42] but is gaining some strength and gaining
[51:44] some health i do not remember his age
[51:47] he's in his 80s
[51:49] but he is gaining strength and prayer is
[51:52] making a difference his wife also has
[51:54] covenant and is at home with it and they
[51:57] have been asking people on online to
[51:59] pray
[52:00] uh for them a couple years ago we had an
[52:03] opportunity to visit in his music shop
[52:05] and talk with him for a long time
[52:08] and we have stayed connected through
[52:10] messenger
[52:11] and uh so we're praying for that family
[52:14] and praying that the lord will bring him
[52:15] through he's probably got a song or two
[52:17] yet to sing and so i thought it was
[52:19] appropriate that we sung that song this
[52:21] morning that's gone around the world
[52:24] thank you lord for your blessings on me
[52:26] uh sister rhonda shaw please pray for me
[52:29] i'm still having pain sitting also i'm
[52:32] having a cat scan and on my liver and
[52:35] stomach on tuesday believing for no
[52:37] growths and for continued healing sister
[52:41] ronda so let's believe the lord for her
[52:43] victory and uh brother greeley has said
[52:46] that uh brother nathan and sister
[52:48] shoshanna are not well with sinus
[52:51] infections and whatever or or
[52:54] am i adding to it what did you say
[52:58] and headaches that go with that any most
[53:00] any real sinus problems ghost comes with
[53:03] pressure and and headaches like that and
[53:06] i guess sister sandy are you feeling
[53:07] some better praise god for the victory
[53:10] amen there's a tremendous amount of
[53:12] people i know who are fighting in the
[53:14] sinuses with the infections and so forth
[53:17] and so we're believing god for victory
[53:19] for
[53:20] nathan and shoshanna and for others who
[53:23] are also fighting that sister sharon has
[53:25] asked for prayer for jordan a 21 year
[53:28] old college student diagnosed with
[53:30] breast cancer that god would move and we
[53:33] know that the lord is more than able to
[53:36] heal and to deliver
[53:38] avian is at home today with an ear
[53:40] infection and we want to remember her
[53:42] and her family to the lord in prayer
[53:44] and steve who has come with jeannette
[53:47] quite a few times
[53:49] who really
[53:51] really nearly lost his life he was as
[53:53] close to death just about as close to
[53:55] death as you get with covid
[53:57] and uh
[53:58] he lost uh the the life
[54:02] in several toes during that infection
[54:05] and the battle that that uh went along
[54:07] with it and this week they removed those
[54:10] toes and he is in some pain and but his
[54:13] spirits are good
[54:15] and you know it's it's that's a hard
[54:17] thing to for me my thoughts are that
[54:19] it's a hard thing to go through but but
[54:22] they say he's had just a tremendous uh
[54:24] you know attitude and he said you know
[54:26] i've lost some toes but i got my life
[54:29] i'm living which is a miracle but would
[54:31] you hold him up to the lord in prayer
[54:34] sister pritchner in germany is not doing
[54:37] well at all with some digestive issues
[54:39] and we don't know what all that is but
[54:41] god knows
[54:43] and
[54:44] a lot of times we pray for her rather
[54:46] quietly or privately but
[54:49] she has reached out for prayer and she
[54:51] wants us to know and she wants us all to
[54:53] pray so that tells us that it's of a
[54:56] serious nature we know that god is able
[54:58] to move for her we love her very much
[55:01] and we want to see the lord's help i
[55:03] don't want to say too much about it on
[55:05] the stream today but there has been
[55:08] quite a battle this week in the hospital
[55:10] with brother stephen
[55:12] uh sister anita has really been in the
[55:14] battle
[55:15] and uh it's been ugly it's just been
[55:17] really really ugly and
[55:20] but god is helping them to overcome and
[55:23] you know i mean people don't understand
[55:25] they just don't understand
[55:27] how these things are
[55:29] and so they have been under the
[55:31] microscope
[55:33] and um
[55:34] god is helping them let's just say it
[55:36] that way and that that one of the
[55:38] doctors has kind of spoken for them and
[55:40] it has helped quite a bit his sugar
[55:42] levels
[55:43] unfortunately are are not good at all
[55:47] just
[55:47] really unstable
[55:49] and this can be a sign of different
[55:51] things and they are not sure which
[55:54] they're waiting for cultures to come
[55:56] back and even though he has had
[55:57] tremendous improvement so much so
[56:00] that he will go home under home health
[56:02] care and not under hospice
[56:05] you know that's that's pretty amazing
[56:07] and uh so that he can continue to get
[56:10] fluids and so forth and they're just
[56:12] scratching their heads you know they
[56:13] don't understand
[56:15] we know there's not been a t-total
[56:17] miracle but the improvement yet but
[56:20] there have been so many improvements
[56:22] that they just you know this doesn't fit
[56:25] it doesn't fit any any um
[56:28] textbook uh
[56:30] sent home to crossover situation there's
[56:34] anxiety there that that comes of course
[56:37] with these uh
[56:38] very severe sicknesses and so we want to
[56:40] hold them up to the lord in prayer and
[56:42] i've never mentioned this publicly but
[56:45] there's a lot of things going on in in
[56:47] the lives of those around them including
[56:49] sister anita's dad who she has prayed
[56:52] for
[56:53] for many many many many many years and
[56:56] he is
[56:58] he is responding to this in a very
[57:00] unusual and positive way with a heart
[57:03] turned toward god which has never been
[57:06] for many years and so we give god praise
[57:08] for that he knows what he's doing
[57:11] if you have a need or you know of an
[57:13] urgent need would you hold up your hand
[57:15] this morning let us see that god sees it
[57:18] and he knows what's underneath it and he
[57:20] knows what all is involved and again
[57:22] there are some missing this morning that
[57:24] i don't know why and where they are
[57:26] what's going on in their body but we
[57:28] know that god does
[57:29] and we know he's a healer
[57:31] and we want to believe that god will
[57:33] touch them right where they are would
[57:35] you stand to get today and sister joyce
[57:39] needs a mighty touch from god brother
[57:41] greeley as you could see and here needs
[57:43] a mighty touch from god but god's here
[57:47] and he's more than able to do it amen
[57:50] and i don't know who
[57:52] maybe had a prayer burden to pray for me
[57:54] long about friday but
[57:56] i sure needed it and god has moved for
[57:59] me and i am so thankful for what he did
[58:02] he surely came on the scene so if you
[58:05] happen to be one who had an extra prayer
[58:07] on friday or saturday for me i
[58:09] appreciate it
[58:11] sister
[58:12] tebow is passed she passed her breathing
[58:15] test which was something that was very
[58:17] important for her to pass so we want to
[58:20] thank god for that
[58:23] [Applause]
[58:25] she's going to require some pretty
[58:26] serious surgery where it looks like
[58:28] where they will take a piece of her lung
[58:31] and
[58:32] you know that just sounds awful
[58:35] and not pleasant and and there's a
[58:37] recovery
[58:39] but the problem is if she couldn't have
[58:40] passed that breath test it would have
[58:42] been very serious because they couldn't
[58:44] have done perhaps the surgery that
[58:46] needed to be done
[58:48] and there are some places there that
[58:50] have uh cancer and you nobody wants to
[58:53] think of that
[58:54] nobody wants to say that one form of
[58:57] cancer is better than another form but
[59:00] it really there are some that are a
[59:01] little better than others and
[59:04] if you're going to choose god help us
[59:06] that we never have to choose but if you
[59:08] if you had to have one
[59:10] she has
[59:11] uh
[59:12] the kind that they have found
[59:14] two small places one very small pinpoint
[59:18] size
[59:20] it's the kind that doesn't usually
[59:22] spread fast
[59:23] and so they're hoping and believing that
[59:25] they can go in and get it she's had a
[59:27] lot of peace
[59:29] she has testified of course there are
[59:31] moments of anxiousness when you're
[59:33] sitting there waiting
[59:34] for them to come in the room but she has
[59:36] done amazing and we want to give god
[59:38] praise for that sister flo also has some
[59:41] situations like that that are in god's
[59:43] hands
[59:44] don't know all the details but god knows
[59:47] all the details
[59:49] and i believe these ladies have some
[59:50] more shouting space
[59:52] i just believe god's going to do what he
[59:54] has to do to bring them through so i
[59:56] don't feel now i'm not in their shoes
[59:59] but i don't feel great alarm i don't
[1:00:01] feel great panic i feel peace
[1:00:04] i'm so thankful that if it has to be
[1:00:06] found i would like for it to go and
[1:00:08] never return and never have been found
[1:00:10] but i'm so glad that if it was there it
[1:00:12] needed to be found needed to be dealt
[1:00:14] with so pray for both of them that god
[1:00:17] will give them victory let's just bow
[1:00:19] our heads we don't have to have a song
[1:00:21] first let's just bow our heads father
[1:00:23] we thank you lord that in your hands is
[1:00:27] the best place
[1:00:29] to put all of our needs and all of our
[1:00:31] lives
[1:00:33] we lay that all right down in your hands
[1:00:36] believing lord that you've already been
[1:00:39] on the case
[1:00:40] we're we're behind we're just now
[1:00:42] letting it out or speaking out the need
[1:00:45] but you knew the need before it arrived
[1:00:47] in our lives and you were already
[1:00:50] working according to your will
[1:00:52] for your children so we stand near lord
[1:00:55] realizing and recognizing that in
[1:00:58] reality some of these needs are very
[1:01:01] serious and a bit grave
[1:01:03] but lord we thank you that one is just
[1:01:06] about the same as the other to you
[1:01:09] nothing stands before you lord that you
[1:01:12] can't deal with
[1:01:14] so we lift up every spoken need and
[1:01:17] every unspoken need
[1:01:19] god infection and inflammation and

[1:08:18] us how many of you know it's good to
[1:08:20] let's live it minute by minute
[1:08:22] amen thank you for standing i want you
[1:08:24] to thank god for these musicians
[1:08:27] including sister wes today
[1:08:29] wonderful
[1:08:32] [Music]
[1:08:32] [Applause]
[1:08:35] i loved the worship singing today the
[1:08:38] anointing was here
[1:08:40] especially on that song that we sung at
[1:08:43] the end i love that song
[1:08:46] that was written by
[1:08:48] uh the crab family's dad gerald crabb
[1:08:52] and he knew what it meant to be in the
[1:08:54] fire
[1:08:56] he was pastoring a little church when he
[1:08:57] fell into depression and ended up an
[1:08:59] alcoholic
[1:09:01] he knew what it meant to fall in the
[1:09:03] fire
[1:09:04] he knew what it meant to try to take his
[1:09:06] own life
[1:09:08] he knew what it meant to lose his family
[1:09:10] for quite a bit of time quite a few
[1:09:12] years and he did lose his marriage
[1:09:14] through all of it
[1:09:15] and when he when god reached out to him
[1:09:18] and began to inspire him to write again
[1:09:20] he's one of the greatest songwriters of
[1:09:22] all times
[1:09:24] and if i started naming the songs that
[1:09:26] he's written you would know many many
[1:09:28] many of them that were made famous by
[1:09:31] other groups he just has a gift for
[1:09:32] songwriting but i like it when somebody
[1:09:35] can write from their own pain
[1:09:38] he never promised victories without
[1:09:40] fighting
[1:09:41] here's a man literally on his face
[1:09:44] at the bottom of the barrel he's so
[1:09:46] humiliated he said i was so humiliated
[1:09:50] there was not a person on the earth i
[1:09:51] wanted to see
[1:09:53] because i knew i had shamed and
[1:09:55] disappointed them all
[1:09:57] and god reached down and said gerald
[1:10:00] crabbe this was god's voice speaking to
[1:10:02] him
[1:10:03] gerald crabb i still love you
[1:10:07] he said i heard if i've ever heard god's
[1:10:09] voice i must have because he's given me
[1:10:12] many songs and sermons and so forth i
[1:10:15] thought it was all over including my
[1:10:17] life and i heard a voice say gerald
[1:10:19] crabbe god's voice say gerald crabb i
[1:10:22] still love you
[1:10:23] somebody asked him in an interview said
[1:10:25] what did you say back he said lord jesus
[1:10:28] i still love you if you love me i'll i
[1:10:32] never stop loving you i just got in a
[1:10:34] lot of trouble but if you'll help me and
[1:10:36] you know what he helped him through the
[1:10:38] fire he helped him through the storm he
[1:10:40] helped him fight until he could win the
[1:10:42] victory
[1:10:43] and now he's going and has been for many
[1:10:45] years again going strong for the lord
[1:10:47] those kind of songs speak to us
[1:10:50] how many of you have ever had your
[1:10:52] frustration get out of hand
[1:10:54] this was a man that knew what all that
[1:10:56] was about but god brought him through
[1:10:58] and i'm i appreciated that and i i
[1:11:01] enjoyed that song this morning because
[1:11:02] it was speaking to us at where where we
[1:11:04] are
[1:11:05] philippians chapter 2
[1:11:08] and verse 5.

[1:11:57] which was also
[1:11:58] in
[1:11:59] christ jesus
[1:12:01] that's a good verse
[1:12:03] first corinthians chapter 2
[1:12:06] verse 16 if you'll turn there just one
[1:12:08] verse
[1:12:12] for who hath known
[1:12:15] the mind of the lord
[1:12:18] that he may instruct him
[1:12:21] but
[1:12:22] we have
[1:12:24] the mind of christ
[1:12:27] and finally while you're still standing
[1:12:29] first peter
[1:12:31] chapter four
[1:12:33] verse one and two
[1:12:35] first peter chapter four
[1:12:38] verses one and two for as much then
[1:12:41] i want you to listen carefully to this
[1:12:43] one
[1:12:44] for as much then as christ hath suffered
[1:12:48] for us
[1:12:49] in the flesh
[1:12:52] arm yourselves likewise
[1:12:57] with the same mind
[1:13:00] for he hath suffered in the flesh for he
[1:13:04] that hath suffered in the flesh
[1:13:07] hath ceased
[1:13:09] from sin
[1:13:11] i want to read it again for as much then
[1:13:14] as christ hath suffered for us in the
[1:13:16] flesh arm yourselves likewise
[1:13:21] with the same mind
[1:13:23] for he that hath suffered in the flesh
[1:13:26] hath ceased from sin the next verse
[1:13:30] that he no longer this is christ
[1:13:33] this is christ
[1:13:35] we're reading about christ
[1:13:37] that he no longer should live the rest
[1:13:40] of his time
[1:13:42] in the flesh
[1:13:45] to the lusts of men
[1:13:48] but to
[1:13:49] the will of god
[1:13:52] now i want to read both verses again i
[1:13:54] want to read them together without a
[1:13:55] pause
[1:13:56] for as much then as christ hath suffered
[1:13:59] for us in the flesh
[1:14:00] arm yourselves likewise with the same
[1:14:03] mind
[1:14:04] for he that has suffered in the flesh
[1:14:07] hath ceased from sin
[1:14:09] that he no longer should live the rest
[1:14:12] of his time in the flesh to the lusts of
[1:14:16] men but to the will of god we are
[1:14:21] reading about christ
[1:14:24] we're not reading as though you and i
[1:14:26] are the ones
[1:14:28] who must live the rest of the time in
[1:14:30] our flesh
[1:14:32] without or above the lust of men but to
[1:14:34] the will of god we're reading
[1:14:36] that christ is our example in this
[1:14:41] he suffered in the manner that he
[1:14:43] suffered
[1:14:44] that he no longer should live the rest
[1:14:48] of his time in the flesh to the lusts of
[1:14:52] men but to the will of god
[1:14:55] and because he overcame that's exactly
[1:14:58] what happened to him
[1:15:00] he died he suffered in the flesh which
[1:15:03] by the way doesn't just mean the
[1:15:04] physical body
[1:15:06] it also means earthly condition
[1:15:11] it's the same word
[1:15:12] so he suffered in earthly condition or
[1:15:16] in earthly existence
[1:15:18] and he did that it was necessary because
[1:15:21] he was god in the body of flesh it was
[1:15:24] necessary that he suffered the manner in
[1:15:26] which he did so that he no longer should
[1:15:29] live the rest of his time in the flesh
[1:15:32] to
[1:15:33] the lusts of men but to
[1:15:36] the will of god
[1:15:39] there was a glorious transformation that
[1:15:42] took place in the suffering of his flesh
[1:15:45] so that he would no longer have to live
[1:15:49] underneath
[1:15:51] the pressure or the pull of the lust of
[1:15:54] men
[1:15:55] but to the will of god
[1:15:57] and because he did you and i can also
[1:16:00] live victorious above the lusts of men
[1:16:04] and to totally surrender to
[1:16:08] the will of god if you understand that
[1:16:11] and believe it you can say amen
[1:16:13] father we thank you this morning that
[1:16:16] you are god's sovereign
[1:16:19] you are god's supreme
[1:16:21] and you are god good
[1:16:23] what a good
[1:16:25] god what a good papa what a good father
[1:16:29] you are
[1:16:30] you have equipped us
[1:16:34] by going before us
[1:16:36] as our example
[1:16:39] suffering
[1:16:41] in every way tempted in every way
[1:16:45] challenged
[1:16:46] in every way
[1:16:48] that man
[1:16:50] those who follow you
[1:16:52] would also be
[1:16:54] tested and tempted
[1:16:56] and in every manner that they would
[1:16:59] suffer
[1:17:00] not just the physical
[1:17:02] beating
[1:17:04] and crucifixion of your body but all
[1:17:08] that you experienced in earth's
[1:17:10] environment
[1:17:12] you saw jealousy and you saw
[1:17:14] resentment and you saw strife
[1:17:18] and you saw men vying for glory and
[1:17:21] position
[1:17:23] and you saw
[1:17:25] a tyrant you saw
[1:17:28] dictators you saw
[1:17:30] the occupation of the city
[1:17:33] that you loved so much you experienced
[1:17:36] all the pressures of political life
[1:17:40] you saw it all
[1:17:42] you experienced it all and you suffered
[1:17:45] in such a way that you would no longer
[1:17:48] have to live according to the lust of
[1:17:50] men
[1:17:51] but that you could live every day every
[1:17:54] hour every moment of your life according
[1:17:57] to the will of your father according to
[1:17:59] the will of god and you have made it
[1:18:01] possible today for your children to do
[1:18:05] the same o lord how we thank you for
[1:18:08] what you did for us
[1:18:10] how we thank you for the trail that you
[1:18:12] blazed for us and we ask that you help
[1:18:15] us in our time in your word today
[1:18:19] we give you honor and glory it's in the
[1:18:21] name above every name the name of the
[1:18:23] lord jesus christ yeshua our messiah we
[1:18:26] pray and the church said
[1:18:29] amen you may be seated don't be too
[1:18:31] quiet
[1:18:32] there's enough of you here today that
[1:18:34] you can you can get something
[1:18:37] because you can pull
[1:18:38] you can put forth a little effort
[1:18:41] and god can speak to you
[1:18:43] if you have an ear to hear he can speak
[1:18:45] to your heart is that right
[1:18:47] so now i want to read first peter
[1:18:49] chapter 4 verse 1 and 2 in the amplified
[1:18:52] bible
[1:18:53] and i want you to see it slightly
[1:18:55] amplified
[1:18:57] so since christ suffered in the flesh
[1:19:01] for us
[1:19:05] for
[1:19:06] you arm yourselves i want you to say
[1:19:10] that with me arm yourselves that's the
[1:19:13] title of this message today arm
[1:19:16] yourselves
[1:19:18] with the same thought
[1:19:20] and purpose
[1:19:22] king james says arm yourselves
[1:19:27] with this likewise
[1:19:29] with the same mind
[1:19:31] the mind that christ had
[1:19:34] when he faced
[1:19:36] the sufferings of life
[1:19:38] the mind that christ had when he faced
[1:19:42] his everyday existence
[1:19:44] and all of it was not was not full of
[1:19:47] pleasure and delight there was suffering
[1:19:51] before gethsemane there was suffering
[1:19:54] before the cross
[1:19:56] his heart was crushed before his body
[1:19:58] was ever crushed he was weeping over
[1:20:02] jerusalem oh jerusalem jerusalem how oft
[1:20:06] i would have gathered you as a hen what
[1:20:09] are brood and you would not oh jerusalem
[1:20:12] thou that killeth the prophets all you
[1:20:15] scribes and pharisees who have
[1:20:18] whitened the outside of the sepulcher
[1:20:22] but have left the inside just a
[1:20:24] graveyard full of dead men's bones
[1:20:27] oh you generation of vipers must i go on
[1:20:32] his suffering for the righteousness of
[1:20:35] his father was not just in gethsemane
[1:20:38] and it was not just in the cross he
[1:20:40] suffered through his entire life
[1:20:43] remember we don't have a little
[1:20:44] miracle-working jesus as a child like
[1:20:47] the movie studios have portrayed him
[1:20:50] we have a boy that grew up rather
[1:20:53] ordinary we believe
[1:20:56] think about it
[1:20:58] he grew up rather ordinary we believe
[1:21:01] and the first time that we have a record
[1:21:04] of the supernatural breaking forth in
[1:21:06] his life he was already a grown man
[1:21:10] he was attending the wedding in cana of
[1:21:13] galilee and there was a need for more
[1:21:15] wine and he turned water into wine and
[1:21:20] blessed the day with his presence and
[1:21:22] with the supernatural manifestation of
[1:21:25] who he was
[1:21:27] even though he had not demonstrated his
[1:21:30] power before mary knew in her heart all
[1:21:32] along that one of these days his time
[1:21:35] was coming
[1:21:36] and he was going to manifest who he
[1:21:38] really was
[1:21:40] and the answer to the question that so
[1:21:42] many people make fun of the song this
[1:21:45] time of year i'm not going to make fun
[1:21:47] of the song mary did you know in its
[1:21:49] 30th anniversary year
[1:21:52] a lot of people make fun of it and they
[1:21:53] say of course she knew don't you know
[1:21:56] what luke says and how the angel of the
[1:21:58] lord came and told her who she was and
[1:22:02] what she was going to carry yes i've
[1:22:04] read luke haven't you but i can still
[1:22:07] tell you she didn't know it all oh no
[1:22:10] god didn't let her know it all
[1:22:12] there was a lot of it she wasn't going
[1:22:14] to know until she lived it until she
[1:22:16] experienced it
[1:22:18] i don't know if she knew how it was
[1:22:20] really going to cost her when she said
[1:22:23] be it unto me according to your word but
[1:22:25] she said it with all the faith that she
[1:22:27] had
[1:22:29] and that faith that caused her to say be
[1:22:31] it unto me according to thy word that
[1:22:34] carried her all the way from bethlehem
[1:22:37] to the foot of the cross when she saw
[1:22:39] the one she loved so much crushed
[1:22:42] in her presence
[1:22:44] she was able to go all the way because
[1:22:47] her faith said in god's time he's going
[1:22:49] to do it in god's timing he's going to
[1:22:51] let this and that in the other but i
[1:22:53] don't think that she knew exactly who he
[1:22:56] was
[1:22:58] i believe she knew that he came from god
[1:23:01] but i'm not sure she knew that he was
[1:23:03] god
[1:23:04] and somebody said how is that even
[1:23:07] possible i don't know ask your church
[1:23:09] friends
[1:23:10] ask the majority of church people today
[1:23:13] who believe that he came from god but
[1:23:15] they're not sure whether or not he is
[1:23:17] god well i want you to know he is god
[1:23:21] and all that the father was he poured
[1:23:23] into the sun and all that the son is he
[1:23:27] has made available and poured into his
[1:23:28] overcoming bride church if you believe
[1:23:31] that same man
[1:23:32] so there was a lot of suffering and a
[1:23:34] lot of struggle
[1:23:35] and he grew up with a sort of an
[1:23:37] ordinary life that's how god wanted it
[1:23:39] to be
[1:23:42] he disappointed his parents and he got
[1:23:44] royally chewed out
[1:23:48] because god wanted to know he wanted to
[1:23:50] understand what it feels like
[1:23:54] for a child to be uh sometimes unfairly
[1:23:58] accused and dealt with by a parent
[1:24:01] who didn't fully understand the
[1:24:02] situation so you could go through his
[1:24:05] life and there wouldn't be anything that
[1:24:07] he experienced
[1:24:09] there wouldn't be anything that he went
[1:24:11] through that that you wouldn't be able
[1:24:13] to say i've been through that or i know
[1:24:16] someone who has experienced something
[1:24:18] like that if he was going to be a high
[1:24:20] priest for all he had to be a high
[1:24:22] priest for all
[1:24:24] and if he was going to be a high priest
[1:24:26] for all he had to understand everything
[1:24:29] that anybody on this earth would ever
[1:24:32] face in their life
[1:24:34] and god allowed him to live sort of an
[1:24:36] ordinary childhood
[1:24:39] pleasing his parents sometime and
[1:24:41] disappointing his parents sometime and
[1:24:44] working around the
[1:24:46] shop with his uh earthly dad and i don't
[1:24:50] know what it was all like because the
[1:24:52] bible doesn't tell us what it was all
[1:24:53] like but there came a time the fullness
[1:24:56] of time
[1:24:57] when not only was he manifested into the
[1:24:59] earth but now he would rise and
[1:25:01] demonstrate all that he was sent forth
[1:25:04] to do
[1:25:05] and everything that jesus went through
[1:25:07] all the suffering not just the cross not
[1:25:10] just the whipping with the catalyned
[1:25:12] tails
[1:25:13] not just the vinegar and gall not just
[1:25:16] the crown of thorns on his head or the
[1:25:19] sword or spear in his side not just that
[1:25:23] but every difficulty that he experienced
[1:25:26] in his earthly life everything he
[1:25:29] suffered in the flesh
[1:25:31] because of the flesh
[1:25:33] because he lived in the environment of
[1:25:36] the earth
[1:25:37] everything he went through all of that
[1:25:40] was for a reason
[1:25:42] number one that he could be the greatest
[1:25:44] high priest the world is ever known
[1:25:47] and number two so that he could overcome
[1:25:51] first
[1:25:52] it was necessary that he overcome every
[1:25:56] temptation and every lust
[1:25:59] and every testing it was necessary that
[1:26:03] he overcome first so that he could get
[1:26:06] to a place where he was no longer
[1:26:08] vulnerable hear me please
[1:26:11] where he was no longer vulnerable to the
[1:26:14] lust of the flesh
[1:26:16] he was no longer vulnerable to the pools
[1:26:19] of the earth but he could now be totally
[1:26:23] completely surrendered to the will of
[1:26:26] his father
[1:26:27] this did not happen post-cross
[1:26:32] this happened pre-cross
[1:26:35] this didn't just happen in the garden of
[1:26:38] gethsemane which was before the cross
[1:26:41] but this happened every time he was
[1:26:43] tempted
[1:26:45] every time he was pressured
[1:26:48] with lusts
[1:26:50] with thoughts
[1:26:52] with lies
[1:26:54] you see if if jesus is going to suffer
[1:26:57] in all manner
[1:26:58] as we are and he's going to fight that
[1:27:01] lust battle and that thought battle that
[1:27:04] i want you to think about the fact that
[1:27:06] in him in his mind as he lived here on
[1:27:11] earth he was fighting a battle
[1:27:14] oh
[1:27:15] and and
[1:27:16] what was that about well for some it was
[1:27:19] rejection
[1:27:20] because it broke his heart to see how
[1:27:22] quickly some could reject what he was
[1:27:25] offering them
[1:27:27] just very religiously
[1:27:30] very arrogantly flippantly they could
[1:27:33] reject it because it didn't fit their
[1:27:35] particular thoughts about how messiah
[1:27:37] would come so they just rejected him
[1:27:40] very very quickly and mocked him and
[1:27:42] made fun of him there was a whole lot
[1:27:44] that went on and we don't know all about
[1:27:46] it but every time lust pulled every time
[1:27:50] a thought a negative thought a thought
[1:27:52] of rejection uh anything that you would
[1:27:55] go through in all manner
[1:27:57] all manner remember all manner
[1:27:59] every time he would deal with something
[1:28:01] like that he overcame
[1:28:03] and he overcame not just for himself he
[1:28:06] overcame for every one of us
[1:28:08] so that you and i post not post
[1:28:12] rapture
[1:28:15] pre-rapture
[1:28:17] so that you and i could overcome every
[1:28:20] bit of of lust and every bit of pull of
[1:28:23] the flesh and every unhealthy negative
[1:28:26] thought that the enemy would bring to
[1:28:28] our mind so that we could overcome every
[1:28:30] bit of that
[1:28:31] and be totally surrendered and submitted
[1:28:35] to the to the will of our father it was
[1:28:38] all for a purpose if jesus won the
[1:28:41] battle over the flesh he won the mind
[1:28:43] battle
[1:28:45] if he went all the way he won the mind
[1:28:46] battle
[1:28:47] if he made it through gethsemane he won
[1:28:49] the mind battle and so the mind that he
[1:28:52] now has is not a mind that is related to
[1:28:56] the things of the earth it is not a mind
[1:28:58] that is connected to the realm of the
[1:29:01] flesh but the mind that he now has is
[1:29:03] the mind of his father is that right he
[1:29:06] now has the mind of god so when he
[1:29:09] resurrected from the dead he didn't
[1:29:11] resurrect with the mind of a man he
[1:29:13] resurrected with the mind of god
[1:29:16] remember brother greeley sermon to us
[1:29:19] taking one of these verses and carrying
[1:29:21] it down who thought it not robbery to be
[1:29:23] equal to god
[1:29:25] he raised up not with a mind that had
[1:29:28] been polluted
[1:29:30] by the lusts and temptations and lying
[1:29:32] thoughts of the flesh but he resurrected
[1:29:35] with a mind that was so pure
[1:29:38] it was the mind of god
[1:29:40] undiluted mind of god
[1:29:43] uncontaminated mind of god
[1:29:46] he never had to pray another prayer and
[1:29:48] ask the father what his will was
[1:29:52] he never would stand again with a mind
[1:29:55] that was in conflict
[1:29:57] to the will of the father
[1:29:59] he won that battle every battle but this
[1:30:01] is an important battle because it tells
[1:30:04] us that the scripture says here we are
[1:30:07] to arm ourselves with the same mind
[1:30:11] we have been promised
[1:30:14] a way to overcome every battle every
[1:30:17] temptation every lust
[1:30:19] with every temptation he has promised to
[1:30:22] make a way of escape and the way of
[1:30:24] escape is a weapon
[1:30:27] and the weapon is the word
[1:30:29] but the weapon is not just the word the
[1:30:31] weapon is also the mind of christ
[1:30:35] and so the apostle said here arm
[1:30:38] yourselves likewise with the same mind
[1:30:42] whose mind the mind that christ had not
[1:30:46] a mind according to the flesh
[1:30:48] he won the victory over that mind but
[1:30:50] the mind of god the one that gave him
[1:30:54] the ability to totally surrender to the
[1:30:58] will of god and not any longer to the
[1:31:03] lust of men by the flesh are you
[1:31:06] following
[1:31:07] so since christ suffered in the flesh
[1:31:10] for us for you
[1:31:11] arm yourselves with the same thought and
[1:31:14] purpose patiently to suffer rather than
[1:31:18] fail to please god i want you to wake up
[1:31:21] now
[1:31:22] you don't have to say man but i don't
[1:31:24] want you sleeping in here this morning i
[1:31:26] want you to hear this
[1:31:27] because this is vitally important
[1:31:30] to overcome the hour we're living in and
[1:31:32] we've got to overcome we can't afford
[1:31:35] not to overcome we can't afford not to
[1:31:38] make it we've got to make it and we've
[1:31:40] got to make it with the victory that's
[1:31:41] promised to us because we're going to
[1:31:43] face some things
[1:31:44] we're we're facing things now and we're
[1:31:47] going to face some things don't you
[1:31:49] think that one or two is the only ones
[1:31:50] who'll ever get a diagnosis that would
[1:31:52] strike fear in your heart that you have
[1:31:54] to deal with listen before this thing is
[1:31:56] over as we live here many of us are
[1:31:58] going to face similar battles like this
[1:32:01] and we've got to know that if jesus
[1:32:03] christ could take on the will of his
[1:32:04] father and the mind of his father live
[1:32:07] with the mind of christ is the mind of
[1:32:09] god i can show you
[1:32:10] the the mind of christ is the mind of
[1:32:12] god and if he did that so that he would
[1:32:15] no longer be vulnerable to the lust of
[1:32:17] men but he would only be submitted to
[1:32:20] the will of god then you and i will find
[1:32:22] our victory in the same way our victory
[1:32:24] is the same way his victory has come
[1:32:28] so we read on for whosoever uh patiently
[1:32:31] to suffer listen patiently to suffer
[1:32:34] rather than fail to please god
[1:32:37] you may not be living the the life you
[1:32:40] would choose if you could have chosen
[1:32:42] but you are living a life that has been
[1:32:44] chosen
[1:32:45] and the end results of the life that has
[1:32:47] been chosen for you is that you would
[1:32:49] learn to patiently
[1:32:51] endure
[1:32:52] suffer which is not just
[1:32:55] having your body crucified
[1:32:58] it's so much more than that
[1:33:00] it's the it's the internal suffering
[1:33:03] it's the internal
[1:33:05] and emotional wounding that we go
[1:33:07] through as we fight this good fight it's
[1:33:10] all of it and every bit of it has a
[1:33:12] purpose and that is to teach us how to
[1:33:15] patiently endure suffering no matter how
[1:33:18] it comes to the flesh and we'd rather do
[1:33:21] that again and again and again and again
[1:33:23] and again than fail
[1:33:25] then
[1:33:26] are you listening then fail to please
[1:33:29] god
[1:33:30] if you fail to please god i'm preaching
[1:33:32] to you if you fail to please god you've
[1:33:36] lost it
[1:33:40] you've just lost it
[1:33:42] now i don't mean because we fail along
[1:33:45] the way we fail along the way
[1:33:47] and we better recognize when we do so
[1:33:50] that we can repent and come home
[1:33:52] and renew ourselves to papa we must do
[1:33:55] that but i want you to know at the end
[1:33:58] of this you've got to be a winner
[1:34:00] at the end of this you've got to be an
[1:34:02] overcomer at the end of this you cannot
[1:34:04] fail
[1:34:06] to please god
[1:34:07] you've got to know you've pleased him
[1:34:10] because this is the purpose of your
[1:34:11] birth to please god for whoever has
[1:34:14] suffered in the flesh having the mind of
[1:34:16] christ
[1:34:20] for whoever has suffered in the flesh
[1:34:22] having the mind of christ is done with
[1:34:25] intentional sin
[1:34:28] has stopped pleasing himself and the
[1:34:31] world
[1:34:32] and pleases god
[1:34:35] powerful
[1:34:36] next verse
[1:34:38] is that both verses
[1:34:41] no
[1:34:43] so that he can no longer spin the rest
[1:34:46] of his natural life living by his human
[1:34:50] appetites and desires
[1:34:52] but he lives
[1:34:55] for what god wills
[1:34:58] now the amplified takes what christ has
[1:35:02] done for us and puts the responsibility
[1:35:04] back on us as though verse 2 is only
[1:35:07] referring to you and i and not to christ
[1:35:09] but i want you to know he is referring
[1:35:12] first to christ winning the victory over
[1:35:16] the desires of the flesh and the lust of
[1:35:18] men and because he did i can
[1:35:21] and because he has i have
[1:35:24] in that right we know that by the word
[1:35:26] now this this thought arm yourself
[1:35:30] what are you arming yourself with what
[1:35:32] kind of weapon are we to take up in this
[1:35:35] hour when we know the battle is raging
[1:35:38] what kind of weapon will help us to win
[1:35:40] the victory over the lust and appetites
[1:35:43] of the flesh
[1:35:44] the desires of the flesh it is the word
[1:35:47] but how do we make the word personal
[1:35:50] we understand that the mind of christ
[1:35:54] is the word if you need the mind of
[1:35:57] christ you'll find it
[1:36:01] in the word
[1:36:02] if you have the word
[1:36:05] you have the mind of christ if you
[1:36:08] ignore the word that you have you'll
[1:36:11] continue to think with a natural mind
[1:36:14] but if you receive the word that has
[1:36:16] come to you
[1:36:18] particularly the message for your day
[1:36:21] if you will receive that into your life
[1:36:24] as an individual you can know by by all
[1:36:28] means
[1:36:29] without any shadow of a doubt that you
[1:36:32] are not warring with a flesh mind you
[1:36:34] are battling with the mind of christ arm
[1:36:37] yourselves with the same kind of mind
[1:36:40] that christ had when he overcome it all
[1:36:43] arm yourselves with the same kind of
[1:36:45] mind that christ had when he overcame it
[1:36:49] all it's a powerful promise now that
[1:36:51] word arm yourself it means to take up
[1:36:54] arms
[1:36:56] in the greek it means to make ready
[1:37:00] it means to equip
[1:37:03] it means to take up tools
[1:37:07] or weapons
[1:37:09] as in a militia
[1:37:12] so we're not just talking about hammers
[1:37:15] and nails
[1:37:16] arm yourself with hammers and nails
[1:37:19] we're talking about with the weapons of
[1:37:22] a militia
[1:37:24] now the weapons of a militia in the
[1:37:26] bible would be spears and swords and and
[1:37:31] catapults and whatever was available to
[1:37:33] them but in our way of thinking to arm
[1:37:36] yourself now would be with bullets
[1:37:40] and it would be as brother branham said
[1:37:42] atomic bombs
[1:37:44] and real nuclear warfare we're talking
[1:37:47] about the the most powerful and potent
[1:37:50] weapons that man could create
[1:37:54] and god is saying to us to have the mind
[1:37:57] of christ to fight with the mind of
[1:38:00] christ to arm yourselves with the mind
[1:38:04] of christ is to utilize the greatest
[1:38:07] weapon that anyone has ever used to
[1:38:10] overcome any situation
[1:38:13] including warfare
[1:38:14] in the natural
[1:38:16] so this is a real message to you and i
[1:38:20] take up arms
[1:38:22] we're not talking about
[1:38:24] that gun under your your pants or in
[1:38:26] your bag
[1:38:28] we're because i want you to know
[1:38:30] you can win every skirmish in the
[1:38:32] natural like that and lose the one that
[1:38:34] matters the most
[1:38:36] there's one battle that means a whole
[1:38:38] lot more than that
[1:38:39] come on now
[1:38:41] and what i don't understand is somebody
[1:38:44] who at the drop of a hat would take up a
[1:38:47] weapon to arm to protect their
[1:38:50] automobile
[1:38:55] but they won't use the weapons that have
[1:38:57] been given to us free
[1:39:00] you don't have to have a license to
[1:39:01] carry
[1:39:03] you don't have to go through a lot of
[1:39:04] red tape to have
[1:39:06] god has given us everything we need to
[1:39:09] win this mind battle
[1:39:11] he said just take up the same mind that
[1:39:13] christ took up
[1:39:15] utilize the mind of christ and you'll be
[1:39:19] able to deal with every lust of the
[1:39:20] flesh
[1:39:21] every lust of men all that comes against
[1:39:24] us in the flesh realm you'll be able to
[1:39:26] fight every bit of that it's the exact
[1:39:28] same word it's it's just one time
[1:39:30] removed i should say
[1:39:32] really it's just one time removed
[1:39:35] because how many of you know in greek
[1:39:36] like hebrew there's a root word and then
[1:39:38] you build on that root word
[1:39:41] and so you can look at the numbers and
[1:39:43] see the sequence of how they have built
[1:39:46] on that root word the next number
[1:39:49] the next greek number arm yourself is
[1:39:52] greek 3695
[1:39:54] the next word that i'm going to mention
[1:39:56] to you is
[1:39:58] 3696.
[1:39:59] so it it's it's almost the same word in
[1:40:03] fact it's the same root
[1:40:05] it's not even a different root it's just
[1:40:08] one one more
[1:40:10] aspect just take it just a little bit
[1:40:12] further
[1:40:13] it's the word in second corinthians 10 4
[1:40:17] that we've been reading over and over
[1:40:19] again for the weapons of our warfare are
[1:40:21] not carnal
[1:40:23] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:40:25] carnal but mighty through god to the
[1:40:26] pulling down of stronghold that word
[1:40:28] weapons
[1:40:29] is almost the exact same word as arm
[1:40:32] yourself
[1:40:34] so we're talking about uh weapons for
[1:40:37] battle weapons for war
[1:40:40] that word
[1:40:41] it means any instrument one uses to
[1:40:44] prepare to make ready an instrument
[1:40:47] designed to make ready for a military
[1:40:50] engagement
[1:40:52] so when peter says arm yourselves
[1:40:55] he means take up weapons
[1:40:58] and the weapon that he suggests
[1:41:01] is to have the same attitude
[1:41:06] that christ had
[1:41:08] to face your problems the same way
[1:41:11] christ faced his problem
[1:41:14] by leaning on his papa
[1:41:16] how are you going to get through what
[1:41:17] you're going through right now same way
[1:41:20] christ did
[1:41:21] by leaning on his daddy
[1:41:23] come on now how are you going to get
[1:41:25] through by leaning on your daddy
[1:41:27] and when you're right in the middle of
[1:41:29] the battle and you don't know how to win
[1:41:31] you're going to reach over and take up
[1:41:33] the arm
[1:41:35] you're going to take up the weapon
[1:41:38] you're going to take up whatever god has
[1:41:40] provided for us and you're going to use
[1:41:42] that to defeat the enemy
[1:41:45] and what is that well
[1:41:47] the amplified tells us that it is
[1:41:50] it is uh
[1:41:53] having the same thought
[1:41:55] and the same purpose
[1:41:58] that christ had
[1:42:05] to think like him
[1:42:07] to have an attitude like he had
[1:42:10] to have a mindset
[1:42:12] like he had arm yourself with that
[1:42:16] now in a message
[1:42:18] as i thought on my way chicago illinois
[1:42:21] i'm pushing through this because i want
[1:42:23] you to have some weapons
[1:42:27] as i thought on my way paragraph 35
[1:42:33] it's wrong
[1:42:36] god's infinite
[1:42:39] let's see if we can find it
[1:42:43] this would be from last week's notes
[1:42:46] we're not in this week's yet
[1:42:50] hallelujah
[1:42:51] there you go it's wrong
[1:42:53] god's infinite and when he speaks
[1:42:58] it's got to be perfect
[1:43:00] he cannot change
[1:43:03] how many of you believe he cannot change
[1:43:06] we cannot alter god's word we have to
[1:43:09] alter our thinking to his thinking
[1:43:14] so we need to discover how christ looked
[1:43:17] at suffering
[1:43:20] and we need to make sure that we're
[1:43:22] looking at suffering the same way he
[1:43:24] looked at suffering
[1:43:26] then we have armed ourself
[1:43:28] with his mind come on now
[1:43:31] how do you think he looked at suffering
[1:43:32] he kept his eyes on papa
[1:43:35] and he kept looking ahead knowing that
[1:43:38] at the end of this
[1:43:40] the glory that was going to be yours
[1:43:44] the glory that you were going to share
[1:43:47] with him
[1:43:48] the glory that i was going to share with
[1:43:51] him would be far more valuable
[1:43:56] than any few minutes
[1:43:58] of heartache or suffering or rejection
[1:44:02] or mental anguish or emotional distress
[1:44:06] or anxiety he kept his eye on the goal
[1:44:10] and the goal was many sons the goal was
[1:44:14] that many sons would come to the same
[1:44:16] glory that he knew he was coming to this
[1:44:19] was his desire so we arm ourselves by
[1:44:22] making sure that we approach our
[1:44:25] hardship like he did
[1:44:29] this is what peter's telling us
[1:44:31] we can't alter god's word
[1:44:33] we have to alter our thinking to his
[1:44:36] thinking
[1:44:37] let the mind of christ be in you
[1:44:41] then you'll think like he thinks
[1:44:45] that's not just like a desire for the
[1:44:48] lost a burden for lost souls that's
[1:44:51] powerful and he loved the lost he gave
[1:44:55] himself for all mankind but this in
[1:44:58] context is we're looking at hardship at
[1:45:03] temptation we're looking at trials the
[1:45:06] same way he did knowing that these are
[1:45:09] just temporary bumps in the road
[1:45:11] i can just get through this hump
[1:45:14] one more valley
[1:45:16] one more hill
[1:45:18] one more heartache
[1:45:20] and then i got him for all eternity
[1:45:23] whoo
[1:45:24] if you're looking at 20 years of valleys
[1:45:26] ahead of you you're going to get washed
[1:45:28] out and discouraged but if you were to
[1:45:30] look at it like hey if i can get through
[1:45:33] the next valley whoa that might be the
[1:45:36] last one
[1:45:37] somebody said joe you're going to trick
[1:45:38] yourself you're going to try to fool
[1:45:41] yourself so you can keep the victory
[1:45:43] that's not it at all that's celebrating
[1:45:45] what god's doing for you right now
[1:45:48] so that you'll have strength to
[1:45:49] celebrate down the road somewhere
[1:45:51] hallelujah
[1:45:52] how many of you have ever had your
[1:45:54] feelings hurt
[1:45:55] maybe one more time i doubt it
[1:45:59] maybe one more time is all it'll ever
[1:46:02] have to happen
[1:46:04] and it'll never have to happen again
[1:46:06] the reality is one of these days
[1:46:12] that'll be it
[1:46:14] how many of you ever fought hard for
[1:46:15] your way and then got it and realized
[1:46:17] you'd been dumb
[1:46:21] you fought for your way then you got
[1:46:23] your way then you realized it wasn't
[1:46:25] worth the fight
[1:46:26] come on now you made a big mistake
[1:46:29] anybody ever been guilty
[1:46:31] you may have only one more of them
[1:46:36] whatever it is
[1:46:39] you know after you get a certain age
[1:46:42] you you kind of make a mental list of
[1:46:44] your aches
[1:46:48] and a new one is coming
[1:46:50] maybe that'll be the last one
[1:46:54] maybe one more on the list and there'll
[1:46:56] never be another one because the next
[1:46:59] body will not be subject to that kind of
[1:47:02] deterioration
[1:47:04] the next body is an eternal body
[1:47:07] that'll never waste or wear out aren't
[1:47:09] you thankful for that
[1:47:11] so you can't alter god's word to fit you
[1:47:14] you've got to alter your thinking to fit
[1:47:15] god's word let the mind of christ be in
[1:47:18] you then you'll think like he thinks can
[1:47:20] you say amen in the message el shaddai
[1:47:25] in yakima washington paragraph 14
[1:47:30] when you come to total obedience
[1:47:33] then you can have possession period
[1:47:37] now that's what this scripture was about
[1:47:39] total obedience to the will of the
[1:47:41] father
[1:47:43] no more pulled by the lust of men
[1:47:47] no more tempted like men are tempted but
[1:47:50] finally overcoming and arming yourself
[1:47:53] with the same mind that christ used to
[1:47:55] defeat his enemy
[1:47:58] it's a powerful promise
[1:48:00] when you come to total obedience isn't
[1:48:02] that what the goal is how many of you
[1:48:04] would have total obedience as part of
[1:48:06] what you're pushing toward i want to
[1:48:08] hear him i want to obey him i want to be
[1:48:11] so quick to obey him there's no room for
[1:48:13] the enemy to give me a question
[1:48:15] come on now i don't even want to have to
[1:48:16] take time to say how high
[1:48:18] if he said jump just let me jump if i'm
[1:48:20] not jumping high enough let him tell me
[1:48:23] but let me be immediate and so quick and
[1:48:25] so ready to do what he says and the only
[1:48:28] way to get to that place is to be in a
[1:48:30] position that the lust of men are no
[1:48:32] longer working on us and pulling on us
[1:48:34] and the only way to get that kind of a
[1:48:36] victory is to arm ourselves with the
[1:48:38] thinking of christ and the thinking of
[1:48:40] christ said these things are just
[1:48:42] temporary
[1:48:44] i can get through this
[1:48:47] and we can get to the physical beating
[1:48:49] and say this beating will only last so
[1:48:51] long
[1:48:53] it has to come to an end but that's not
[1:48:55] all the suffering that he did that's
[1:48:56] only a portion of the suffering that he
[1:48:58] did he said you but but uh excuse me
[1:49:01] when you come to total obedience then
[1:49:04] you can have possession but until you
[1:49:06] totally obey you've got to completely
[1:49:09] surrender your own thoughts your own
[1:49:11] will your own mind and let the mind of
[1:49:15] christ operate in you you've got to face
[1:49:18] life the way he faced life you've got to
[1:49:21] look at life the way he looked at life
[1:49:24] you've got to look at suffering like he
[1:49:25] looked at suffering you've got to look
[1:49:27] at victories like he looked at victories
[1:49:30] it's all just a blip on the on the radar
[1:49:33] i'm just getting through this so i can
[1:49:34] get on to the next so that we can
[1:49:36] ultimately have eternity in his glorious
[1:49:40] presence all right let the mind of
[1:49:42] christ operate in you he said now do you
[1:49:44] think christ the mind of christ and you
[1:49:47] would say the days of miracles past
[1:49:50] do you think the mind of christ and you
[1:49:52] would say the bible is right in some
[1:49:53] places and not in others
[1:49:57] you think you wouldn't need to read
[1:49:59] something like that today but you do
[1:50:01] the mind of christ would sanction every
[1:50:05] word that christ ever said it's right
[1:50:09] so if you don't use your own mind
[1:50:11] just
[1:50:12] use his mind i want you to be able to
[1:50:16] put in their mindset
[1:50:19] attitude
[1:50:21] outlook
[1:50:24] i choose today
[1:50:25] to look at this like christ would look
[1:50:28] at it
[1:50:29] you say well he's never gone through
[1:50:30] this
[1:50:32] everything
[1:50:39] i preached that one time and a brother
[1:50:41] came up to me after the service
[1:50:43] i know right where i was preaching
[1:50:47] he said i know something
[1:50:49] that i've had to deal with that jesus
[1:50:51] never had to deal with
[1:50:53] i said will you please tell me what it
[1:50:54] is he said my mother-in-law
[1:51:04] i said well i don't know your
[1:51:05] mother-in-law he said well if you did
[1:51:09] you would know she was a strong-willed
[1:51:11] woman she is a strong-willed woman and i
[1:51:13] said okay then jesus may have never had
[1:51:16] a mother-in-law
[1:51:18] but i guarantee you he dealt with
[1:51:21] strong-willed women
[1:51:25] some of them followed him around
[1:51:28] and he had to deal with them just like
[1:51:30] you're having to deal with her
[1:51:32] so the circumstance may not be exactly
[1:51:35] the same but the battle
[1:51:37] [Applause]
[1:51:39] is the same and the way to win it
[1:51:42] is the same
[1:51:44] all right so
[1:51:45] so he goes on so you don't use your own
[1:51:48] mind just use his mind
[1:51:51] he said that's how visions at night time
[1:51:55] if i use my own mind how
[1:51:58] what could i do i i couldn't do nothing
[1:52:03] but just yield myself to him and then
[1:52:06] listen this is powerful oh but this was
[1:52:08] a prophet
[1:52:11] but just yield myself to him and then he
[1:52:14] uses my
[1:52:16] mind my eyes my mouth he's my all just
[1:52:21] yield that's the way you do it that's
[1:52:24] the way these ministers do it
[1:52:28] when they're preaching the gospel now
[1:52:30] did that sound like somebody who was
[1:52:31] putting that all in himself and not
[1:52:34] leaving it for any of us oh no
[1:52:37] he knew that every man that takes the
[1:52:39] gospel up does not see visions does not
[1:52:42] operate in that kind of a realm he knew
[1:52:44] that
[1:52:45] but he knew that in order for god to use
[1:52:48] them he had to use them the same way he
[1:52:50] used him they've got to get out of their
[1:52:52] mind they can't go by what they see lord
[1:52:55] have mercy is that ever the truth
[1:53:01] can't go by what they see can't go by
[1:53:03] what they'd like to say
[1:53:06] they just have to yield and that's not
[1:53:08] just for preachers
[1:53:10] he goes on
[1:53:13] they get up there and take a text why
[1:53:15] they just start off to preach yield
[1:53:17] themselves to god they're ministers the
[1:53:20] first thing you know the holy spirit
[1:53:22] maybe take them on another text take
[1:53:24] them somewhere else
[1:53:26] see brother branham talked about how
[1:53:28] we're being led and he he is using the
[1:53:30] context of ministry here but i want you
[1:53:32] to know it's the same for you
[1:53:34] on your job it's whatever in your
[1:53:36] dealings with your family and your
[1:53:38] situations to be able to surrender my
[1:53:41] mind to be able to surrender my eyes to
[1:53:43] be able to surrender my notes
[1:53:46] my agenda my plan and let god's plan be
[1:53:49] lived out in that powerful queen of
[1:53:51] sheba
[1:53:54] we're going to move quickly through
[1:53:55] these best best i can
[1:53:57] so there is genuine faith but you must
[1:54:00] come into the real channel of god
[1:54:03] to have that genuine faith there's human
[1:54:06] faith then there's faith of god
[1:54:09] and you must have a godly faith to
[1:54:12] believe remember we tried to
[1:54:15] compare faith in god and the faith of
[1:54:18] god
[1:54:19] and it's not a discussion that a lot of
[1:54:21] people want to follow but it's a
[1:54:23] powerful truth because there's a sixth
[1:54:26] sense
[1:54:27] and that sixth sense is not just having
[1:54:29] faith in god that's receiving a download
[1:54:32] of god's faith and it's going to be very
[1:54:34] very powerful and potent in the hour
[1:54:36] that we're living in i'm just sure of
[1:54:38] that you must have a godly faith to
[1:54:41] believe there's human faith and there's
[1:54:43] faith of god and you must have a godly
[1:54:45] faith to believe can i go on
[1:54:48] uh did you that are asleep is it okay if
[1:54:51] i go on two
[1:54:53] or just the awake ones let's go on
[1:54:58] now then to have godly faith
[1:55:01] you must have the mind of christ in you
[1:55:04] then that's how god projects to you
[1:55:07] visions
[1:55:08] revelations we don't all see visions but
[1:55:11] we all need revelations is that right
[1:55:14] and all these things comes
[1:55:17] by the mind of christ being in you you
[1:55:20] get it let the mind that was in christ
[1:55:23] be in you i don't want you to see the
[1:55:26] mind of christ as something that's
[1:55:28] sitting out here on the table
[1:55:30] and you're putting it on like a helmet
[1:55:32] or a hat i want you to see what it's
[1:55:34] full of
[1:55:36] the mind of christ is full of or the
[1:55:38] right attitude
[1:55:40] the right spirit
[1:55:43] the right way to handle problems in life
[1:55:46] the way to keep the victory when you
[1:55:48] feel like a cussing
[1:55:50] but instead you praise
[1:55:52] all these things that he went through i
[1:55:54] want you to see it that way then you can
[1:55:56] arm yourself with it anytime you choose
[1:55:59] to think like him
[1:56:00] then you're arming yourself with the
[1:56:02] mind that's higher than the mind you
[1:56:04] carry in the natural
[1:56:07] so you get it let the mind that was in
[1:56:09] christ
[1:56:11] be in you now the fundamental
[1:56:14] foundations for faith
[1:56:16] 1955 few more
[1:56:18] and then we're really gonna find find a
[1:56:21] good one here in just a minute they're
[1:56:22] all good to me
[1:56:24] i don't normally choose my quotes until
[1:56:26] sunday morning i've laid my message out
[1:56:29] i know the scriptures that i'm going to
[1:56:30] go to i know if i'm going to pick up
[1:56:32] something from last week
[1:56:34] but i make sure on sunday morning to get
[1:56:36] up early enough to go through and read
[1:56:38] all the quotes that i've laid aside to
[1:56:41] try to find the mind of the lord for the
[1:56:42] ones that we should read in a particular
[1:56:45] service and i want you to know i'm not
[1:56:47] sure that's the best policy
[1:56:49] because when i start going through them
[1:56:51] i get excited oh my goodness
[1:56:53] i can't leave that out
[1:56:55] i can't leave that out
[1:56:57] and then sometime i think i'm going to
[1:56:59] trim that down i don't have to have all
[1:57:01] that paragraph
[1:57:03] because i'm just wanting to emphasize a
[1:57:04] couple of sentences there and i thought
[1:57:06] okay now let me trim that down i'll i'll
[1:57:08] put the dot dot i'll let everybody know
[1:57:10] that's not the whole paragraph and i
[1:57:12] said now let me see where i can trim
[1:57:13] down
[1:57:15] and it becomes very very difficult to do
[1:57:17] that sometime
[1:57:18] he said now if we could throw ourselves
[1:57:20] completely to god
[1:57:24] here i am lord
[1:57:26] and to his will and be lost to our own
[1:57:29] thoughts
[1:57:30] and just let the mind of christ be in us
[1:57:34] i'm going to look at this like christ
[1:57:35] would look at i'm going to face my
[1:57:37] suffering like christ faced his knowing
[1:57:40] that if he held on to papa papa would
[1:57:42] hold on to him
[1:57:44] and just let the mind of christ be in us
[1:57:46] them same operations of the spirit
[1:57:49] them same operations of the spirit would
[1:57:51] work through us just as the natural
[1:57:54] things does
[1:57:55] just the same thing how many of you like
[1:57:58] to have the operations of the spirit
[1:58:00] going on in your life not just the human
[1:58:02] emotions and the things that come with
[1:58:04] thinking of the natural mind because we
[1:58:07] were first created
[1:58:09] for that purpose
[1:58:12] here's your first purpose the purpose
[1:58:14] for which you were first created
[1:58:17] to control
[1:58:22] powerful isn't it
[1:58:23] to rule
[1:58:26] to praise god
[1:58:28] and to live for god
[1:58:31] there you are four
[1:58:32] of the original purposes that you were
[1:58:35] created for to control
[1:58:39] to rule
[1:58:40] to praise god
[1:58:43] and to live
[1:58:45] for god
[1:58:46] now jesus said if ye abide in me and my
[1:58:49] words abide in you you can ask
[1:58:52] what you will and it shall be given unto
[1:58:54] you if you abide in me and my word abide
[1:58:57] in you now the father and his word is
[1:59:01] what you read it
[1:59:02] inseparable
[1:59:06] the father and his word is inseparable
[1:59:09] you can't divide the word from the
[1:59:12] father the eternal spirit of god because
[1:59:14] the word listen because the word is his
[1:59:17] son
[1:59:19] so you can't really divide the son from
[1:59:21] the word
[1:59:23] neither can you really divide the word
[1:59:25] from the father neither can you really
[1:59:27] divide the son from the father
[1:59:31] because father son and word
[1:59:34] father son word and spirit
[1:59:37] is the same
[1:59:39] no i love that now in the beginning was
[1:59:41] the word and the word was with god and
[1:59:44] the word was god
[1:59:46] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:59:49] among us we're going on
[1:59:52] god and his word is inseparable
[1:59:57] you cannot have god without having his
[1:59:59] word and when you have his word
[2:00:05] um
[2:00:08] i don't know if i have his word or not
[2:00:10] do you have god if you've got god you've
[2:00:12] got his word if you've got his word
[2:00:14] you've got god if you've got the father
[2:00:15] you've got the son if you've got the son
[2:00:17] you've got the father
[2:00:19] come on now and if the son comes to live
[2:00:21] inside of you he brings the spirit
[2:00:25] because he is the same
[2:00:27] that doesn't mean that we don't have to
[2:00:29] experience him differently as in the
[2:00:31] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:00:35] but it is the same god
[2:00:37] the same word the same spirit
[2:00:40] is everybody still here
[2:00:42] oh it's early
[2:00:43] we might get through early might not
[2:00:47] now here's the one this morning that i
[2:00:49] thought oh my goodness i i i don't know
[2:00:51] where to start i don't know where to
[2:00:53] stop
[2:00:54] it's in a message from 1962 called the
[2:00:57] conflict between god and satan
[2:01:00] clarksville uh indiana paragraph 58.
[2:01:04] god look at all the look at all the
[2:01:06] highlight
[2:01:09] god knew this great warfare was coming
[2:01:13] on between right and wrong
[2:01:16] and he knew what the enemy was going to
[2:01:18] do he know just exactly how to equip his
[2:01:21] people
[2:01:22] let me tell you something this is so
[2:01:24] stacked
[2:01:30] there's never been
[2:01:32] another
[2:01:34] war quite like this one
[2:01:37] the
[2:01:38] your commander-in-chief knows
[2:01:41] everything there is to know about our
[2:01:45] enemy
[2:01:48] why he created him
[2:01:51] he knows everything there is to know
[2:01:54] about how he thinks how he moves what
[2:01:57] he's planned what's coming next
[2:02:00] and so when god chooses a weapon to give
[2:02:03] you are you with me
[2:02:05] when god chooses a weapon to give you to
[2:02:07] defeat your enemy it is exactly the
[2:02:11] weapon that you need
[2:02:13] because he knew what the enemy was going
[2:02:15] to do he know just exactly how to equip
[2:02:18] his people so if we notice the very
[2:02:21] first thing that god equipped his
[2:02:23] children was
[2:02:27] then he says being infinite
[2:02:29] he knowed what it took to defeat satan
[2:02:34] anytime
[2:02:37] anyplace
[2:02:39] anywhere
[2:02:41] on any conditions
[2:02:43] that covers it all
[2:02:46] you've never fought a battle that's not
[2:02:47] covered in that
[2:02:49] god knew this great warfare was coming
[2:02:52] on
[2:02:53] uh let's go on
[2:02:56] now he wouldn't say listen now i like
[2:02:59] this i like this
[2:03:01] he wouldn't say i'll give them somewhere
[2:03:03] here
[2:03:04] something here and then a few years
[2:03:06] later i may study out something better
[2:03:08] to give them this is god talking
[2:03:11] i'm going to give this to them now to
[2:03:13] fight the enemy with but i almost keep
[2:03:14] studying this
[2:03:16] and something better to give them and
[2:03:18] after a few years later let's go on
[2:03:22] like like we in military force the old
[2:03:25] bow and arrow and sledge and rock hammer
[2:03:28] and then the next after the bow and era
[2:03:30] come the musket and after the musket
[2:03:32] come the springfield and now the atomic
[2:03:35] weapon boy that was a jump but we're
[2:03:37] there
[2:03:38] now the atomic weapon
[2:03:40] weapons
[2:03:41] and things see we keep growing more
[2:03:45] we are constantly developing weapons to
[2:03:48] use against our enemy because we're not
[2:03:50] really sure who our enemy is going to be
[2:03:55] we don't know exactly what our enemy has
[2:03:59] we have intelligence and we have
[2:04:01] satellites and we have spies and we have
[2:04:03] information but we don't know exactly
[2:04:06] who our next battle is going to be
[2:04:07] against and what kind of weapons they're
[2:04:09] going to bring to the war so the united
[2:04:12] states must constantly be developing
[2:04:14] weapons
[2:04:16] to keep up with the technology to be
[2:04:19] able to fight
[2:04:20] against whatever the enemy uses but oh
[2:04:23] this is not the battle you and i fight
[2:04:26] because our god knew from the beginning
[2:04:28] every trick that the enemy would ever
[2:04:31] pull out against you and i and he has
[2:04:34] provided a weapon that we can arm
[2:04:37] ourselves with
[2:04:38] that will always be successful that will
[2:04:41] always be enough under any circumstance
[2:04:44] any place anytime anywhere isn't that
[2:04:48] the goodness of god to us
[2:04:51] it's the goodness of god but god at the
[2:04:53] beginning gave his children the atomic
[2:04:55] weapon
[2:04:56] because he's he's the infinite god now
[2:04:59] seeing there was going to be a conflict
[2:05:00] and there was going to be a battle god
[2:05:03] equipped his children with the right
[2:05:05] kind of ammunition
[2:05:08] didn't he
[2:05:10] right kind of an attack
[2:05:12] the right kind of everything that he had
[2:05:15] need of
[2:05:17] that would sweep them all the way listen
[2:05:22] everything you and i needed to be swept
[2:05:24] all the way from eden
[2:05:27] to
[2:05:28] the rapture
[2:05:30] you've never faced a battle that that
[2:05:33] weapon wasn't enough
[2:05:34] you will never face a battle that that
[2:05:37] weapon will not be enough from eden to
[2:05:40] the rapture
[2:05:41] what was it you tell me
[2:05:44] the word
[2:05:47] that's what defeats satan is the word
[2:05:49] it'll defeat him anywhere
[2:05:52] anyplace
[2:05:54] now why do we want to substitute
[2:05:55] something else when we've already got
[2:05:57] the best thing there is the word
[2:05:59] let's read on and we find jesus on earth
[2:06:02] listen
[2:06:04] just to prove this was the best
[2:06:05] equipment when satan come in
[2:06:08] hand-to-hand combat with jesus
[2:06:11] he never just reached over with his
[2:06:13] power and tied his hands
[2:06:16] he could have sure
[2:06:18] sure he could have
[2:06:19] he just took the same weapon that god
[2:06:22] gave in the garden of eden
[2:06:24] his word
[2:06:26] and said it's written it's written and
[2:06:30] he punched him right out of the ring
[2:06:35] he punched him right out of the ring
[2:06:37] with it that's right because it's
[2:06:40] god's
[2:06:42] best we keep reading
[2:06:46] and look where it is
[2:06:48] it's not just for one or two in a church
[2:06:54] oh yeah we're going to drag this out
[2:06:56] it's not for just one or two in a church
[2:06:59] oh that's all right for them that pray
[2:07:01] all the time
[2:07:04] oh that's all right for them that's all
[2:07:06] right for her that's all right for him
[2:07:08] it's not just for one or two in a church
[2:07:10] it's for every one of us every believer
[2:07:13] has a right every believer has a right
[2:07:16] every believer has a right to take his
[2:07:19] word and fight the enemy
[2:07:23] anywhere you meet him
[2:07:27] anywhere you meet the enemy this word is
[2:07:30] what you have to use and jesus proved it
[2:07:34] when he come can you say amen
[2:07:37] yes he did we're reading on so he
[2:07:39] equipped his children with the word for
[2:07:42] their protection against the enemy then
[2:07:45] when when the all-out warfare comes and
[2:07:48] the battles and set in array then
[2:07:51] there's only one thing a real soldier
[2:07:54] can use a real christian soldier there's
[2:07:58] only one thing a real christian soldier
[2:08:00] can use that's
[2:08:01] thus
[2:08:03] saith
[2:08:04] lord
[2:08:06] that's the mind of christ
[2:08:09] that's the word of god
[2:08:10] you believe that let's read on
[2:08:14] walk right out there and meet the enemy
[2:08:17] with the assurance that
[2:08:21] a thousand may fall at your right ten
[2:08:24] thousand at the left but it won't come
[2:08:26] nightly just remember that god made this
[2:08:28] statement and give this to his children
[2:08:31] and it's the best that's ever been yet
[2:08:35] now look at the last paragraph that
[2:08:36] we're going to use in this message in
[2:08:38] this from this message satan
[2:08:41] in eden
[2:08:42] when he first come to these attack to
[2:08:46] attack a person knowing the children of
[2:08:48] god was fortified with this word satan
[2:08:52] attacked the word
[2:08:57] see what the enemy is
[2:08:58] it's the word
[2:09:01] it's not you
[2:09:06] he's going to disarm us that's what he
[2:09:08] comes to do
[2:09:09] he's he's after the word
[2:09:11] he wants to stop the word
[2:09:14] he wants to cause you to misbelieve the
[2:09:15] word because he knows if you misbelieve
[2:09:18] your weapon if you don't trust your
[2:09:19] weapon
[2:09:20] you won't fight the good fight
[2:09:22] you'll cower in the corner somewhere and
[2:09:24] be defeated every time
[2:09:26] satan attacked the word see he never
[2:09:28] attacked the being he attacked the word
[2:09:29] first satan didn't come to attack eve
[2:09:34] he came to attack the word
[2:09:36] he had to win eve over
[2:09:39] she was the target
[2:09:41] but the word is what he attacked
[2:09:45] because if the enemy could cause her to
[2:09:47] doubt the word
[2:09:49] to reason against the word
[2:09:53] then the enemy knew he already had her
[2:09:55] in his pocket
[2:09:57] because she'll never be able to defeat
[2:10:00] any attack
[2:10:02] whatever comes against her if she doubts
[2:10:04] the word
[2:10:06] if she reasons against the word she'll
[2:10:09] never have what she needs
[2:10:10] to face the temptations and pressures
[2:10:12] and lusts of life
[2:10:15] the only reason that satan was able to
[2:10:18] persuade eve
[2:10:20] to accept his
[2:10:22] slant
[2:10:24] and to yield herself even her body
[2:10:28] to the enemy
[2:10:30] was that he was attacking the word
[2:10:33] he came against the word are you
[2:10:36] listening
[2:10:37] he came against
[2:10:40] the word
[2:10:42] first
[2:10:43] this is how he works
[2:10:46] in the message convinced and then
[2:10:48] concerned
[2:10:50] 62 paragraph 82
[2:10:53] god
[2:10:55] to his army
[2:10:57] every nation tries to equip their army
[2:11:00] with the best
[2:11:01] they must do it to survive
[2:11:03] and god equipping his army being
[2:11:06] infinite know the best armor that there
[2:11:08] was and what did he do he gave his army
[2:11:14] we're not fortified behind denomination
[2:11:18] we're not fortified behind groups we're
[2:11:21] moving on
[2:11:23] we're fortified by the word of god
[2:11:28] and the devil knew that so he tried only
[2:11:30] now the spy the devil trying to find a
[2:11:32] way into that wall he might have tried
[2:11:35] pleasure he might have tried everything
[2:11:38] but you know where he got eve at
[2:11:41] tell me
[2:11:42] on reasonings he didn't just cause her
[2:11:44] to reason he caused her to reason
[2:11:47] against
[2:11:49] the word
[2:11:51] what man is going to go out into a
[2:11:53] battle carrying a weapon that he doesn't
[2:11:55] trust
[2:11:57] he's not going to risk his life to fight
[2:11:59] in a war with a weapon that he doesn't
[2:12:02] trust what the results will be so you've
[2:12:04] got to have the right weapon and you've
[2:12:06] got to have full confidence in that
[2:12:08] weapon if you're going to win against
[2:12:10] the enemy because it comes to reason
[2:12:12] against the mind are you still there
[2:12:14] two two places i want to read from
[2:12:16] spoken word is the original seed
[2:12:19] paragraph 3 58
[2:12:22] he said notice what harmony
[2:12:28] if this sounds familiar to you you will
[2:12:30] find this almost verbatim in the church
[2:12:33] age book
[2:12:34] there are a few places in the church age
[2:12:36] book where you will find this much of a
[2:12:38] sermon verbatim but but you will find
[2:12:41] this this stands out pretty strong
[2:12:44] also in the church age book but here
[2:12:46] we're taking it right from brother
[2:12:47] branham's own words
[2:12:49] notice what harmony
[2:12:51] jesus never did anything until seen of
[2:12:53] the father or the father showed him
[2:12:56] first
[2:12:57] harmony between god and christ see john
[2:13:00] 5 19.
[2:13:01] so will the bride
[2:13:04] and he shows her his word of life
[2:13:07] he shows her she receives it she
[2:13:11] never doubts it
[2:13:13] nothing can harm her not even death for
[2:13:17] if the seed be planted the water will
[2:13:20] raise it up again amen then i got a
[2:13:23] great big hallelujah he said
[2:13:26] here is the secret
[2:13:29] that's worth listening to
[2:13:32] the word is in the bride
[2:13:38] come on come on come on come on
[2:13:41] the word is in the bride and the mind of
[2:13:45] christ
[2:13:47] to know what he wants done with the
[2:13:53] word
[2:13:54] you've got the word and you've got the
[2:13:56] mind of christ
[2:13:58] to know what to do with the word and
[2:14:00] that is to use it against your enemy
[2:14:06] no matter what the battle is no matter
[2:14:08] what the situation is no matter what the
[2:14:10] circumstance is no matter how it makes
[2:14:13] you feel
[2:14:14] you have received the word the word of
[2:14:17] god is in the bride and the mind of
[2:14:20] christ to know how to handle what to do
[2:14:23] what needs to be done what he wants done
[2:14:26] with the word isn't that a powerful
[2:14:29] powerful
[2:14:31] and she does it
[2:14:33] we're going on now
[2:14:35] she does it in his name
[2:14:38] she has
[2:14:41] she has
[2:14:44] she has thus
[2:14:46] saith the lord
[2:14:54] this is the first sermon i ever heard
[2:14:55] brother branham preach
[2:14:57] spoken word is the original seed
[2:15:00] i remember hearing these two paragraphs
[2:15:03] today
[2:15:05] just like i did
[2:15:06] back then
[2:15:08] they caused something on the inside of
[2:15:11] the inside of me to leave
[2:15:13] then
[2:15:14] and it still did this morning when i
[2:15:16] read it before i brought it over here to
[2:15:18] you
[2:15:19] she does it in his name she has the
[2:15:22] sayeth the lord then it is germatized so
[2:15:25] the holy spirit waters it until it is
[2:15:29] grown
[2:15:30] and serves
[2:15:32] its
[2:15:32] purpose
[2:15:34] hallelujah
[2:15:36] isn't that good
[2:15:38] they do only his will
[2:15:42] amen i believe that
[2:15:44] no one can persuade them different
[2:15:47] they
[2:15:48] have thus saith the lord or they keep
[2:15:53] still if you don't have the word on
[2:15:56] something be still
[2:16:01] if you can't put it in the word be still
[2:16:06] then they will do the works of god
[2:16:09] for it is himself in them
[2:16:12] continuing his word to fulfill praise
[2:16:15] god as he did complete in his days all
[2:16:20] things when he was here he did not
[2:16:22] complete all when he was here for it was
[2:16:25] not time yet do you understand this is
[2:16:29] where he leaves room for the bride's
[2:16:31] ministry don't you understand this is
[2:16:33] where he leaves room for the bride to
[2:16:35] move in the powers of god in the last of
[2:16:38] the last days jesus did not finish
[2:16:41] everything that he could have finished
[2:16:43] because some of that was for our time
[2:16:46] some of that was for our day and so it
[2:16:49] is for us to take up the word like he
[2:16:52] took up the word
[2:16:54] to take
[2:16:55] to arm ourselves
[2:16:57] with the mind of christ same sermon
[2:17:02] but a little bit further back in the
[2:17:03] sermon paragraph 2 27
[2:17:07] so believers of the word and spirit must
[2:17:10] be won you get it
[2:17:12] believers the word and the spirit
[2:17:15] believers
[2:17:16] the word and the spirit are absolutely
[2:17:20] one
[2:17:21] these three are one
[2:17:23] believers
[2:17:25] the word
[2:17:26] and the spirit you hear that don't you
[2:17:28] are absolutely one you don't do your own
[2:17:31] thinking
[2:17:33] you don't do use your own mind isn't
[2:17:35] that wonderful
[2:17:37] the mind this mind or the mind was in
[2:17:40] christ
[2:17:41] is in you see
[2:17:43] the mind is in christ
[2:17:46] and you'll take the word just like he
[2:17:48] did
[2:17:49] because he was the word and the mind of
[2:17:51] christ in you you are the word
[2:17:54] now this is where brother branham says
[2:17:56] without a doubt the mind of christ is
[2:17:58] the word
[2:17:59] so if you take the word you're taking
[2:18:01] the mind of christ if you use the word
[2:18:03] to fight the enemy you're using the mind
[2:18:05] of christ to fight the enemy here it is
[2:18:07] in scripture
[2:18:08] here's what the bible has told us and
[2:18:10] now brother branham is pulling this
[2:18:11] together for us in such a way that we
[2:18:13] can understand they're not one and then
[2:18:16] the other it's one in the same and the
[2:18:18] mind of christ in you you are the word
[2:18:20] you're god's living word
[2:18:23] you are a word sent from god
[2:18:26] you're god's living word representatives
[2:18:28] of him here on earth that's right
[2:18:30] continuing the work the church should be
[2:18:34] that way god help us all the church
[2:18:38] should be that way and when so
[2:18:40] the bible is manifested again like in
[2:18:43] the early days of the disciples just
[2:18:45] like the disciple the bible is living
[2:18:48] again in you the bible is living again
[2:18:52] in you this is not for the future this
[2:18:55] is for today the bible is living again
[2:18:58] in you if you can claim that if you can
[2:19:01] believe that if you can give god praise
[2:19:03] then it is a reality
[2:19:04] okay just a little bit more
[2:19:06] i know you're tired of reading but it's
[2:19:08] just a little more
[2:19:10] paragraph 43 of why i'm against
[2:19:13] organized religion
[2:19:15] god has chosen moses
[2:19:17] and god had chosen aaron and it was the
[2:19:20] message of the day and no matter how
[2:19:22] good the other side looked it was
[2:19:25] contrary to god's thinking and we've got
[2:19:27] to let god's thinking be our thinking
[2:19:29] let the mind that was in christ be
[2:19:33] in you
[2:19:35] and there's the answer
[2:19:40] and this bible
[2:19:42] reveals
[2:19:44] are you with me
[2:19:47] and this bible
[2:19:48] reveals the mind
[2:19:51] of christ
[2:19:53] you don't ever have to guess what he's
[2:19:55] thinking
[2:19:57] you find the answer in the bible
[2:20:00] go to the bible first
[2:20:02] go to your absolute first
[2:20:05] the bible was brother branham's quote
[2:20:06] book
[2:20:10] he didn't get up and say like i said the
[2:20:11] other days a few times you hear him say
[2:20:14] like i was telling you the other day but
[2:20:15] that wasn't the most of his message was
[2:20:17] it
[2:20:18] he's just referring back to something he
[2:20:19] mentioned in a service but he didn't get
[2:20:21] up and say paragraph 68
[2:20:24] uh
[2:20:25] of such and such a sermon last year i
[2:20:28] said so and so and so and so he didn't
[2:20:29] do that did he he took it right back to
[2:20:30] the word so go to the word don't be
[2:20:33] afraid to go to the word don't be afraid
[2:20:34] to go to the bible because the bible
[2:20:36] reveals the mind of christ now you want
[2:20:39] to take that to another level you go
[2:20:41] search that through the message of the
[2:20:42] hour because that's what god has given
[2:20:44] us to help us understand how to use the
[2:20:46] word how to use it effectively and
[2:20:48] really to tell us what the word is
[2:20:50] because the denominations never told us
[2:20:53] that that the believer had the father
[2:20:55] the word and the spirit living inside of
[2:20:57] them
[2:20:58] the denominations never told us that the
[2:21:00] mind of christ was the word and the word
[2:21:02] was the mind of christ to have one was
[2:21:03] to have the other and this is how we
[2:21:05] would fight in the last days so god sent
[2:21:08] a message to help us know how to use the
[2:21:10] word how to place the word
[2:21:12] that's why i said that in spoken words
[2:21:14] original seed we just read it and the
[2:21:16] whole book of revelation called the
[2:21:18] apocalypse is the revelation of jesus
[2:21:20] christ and we can see how he condemns
[2:21:22] the thing how he takes it to one side
[2:21:25] and we'll get to it after a bit all
[2:21:27] right
[2:21:28] and then he moves on
[2:21:31] thy seed shall possess the gate of his
[2:21:33] enemy paragraph 86
[2:21:36] and it'll still do it
[2:21:38] the word of god listen to this the word
[2:21:41] of god always attracts that spiritual
[2:21:44] mind
[2:21:46] because it is the mind of christ in you
[2:21:49] that knows that the word
[2:21:55] is true
[2:22:00] one last
[2:22:01] seventh seal
[2:22:03] this is why this is so important
[2:22:08] may i just pass this to you
[2:22:11] when the supernatural comes in
[2:22:14] that's the mind of christ
[2:22:18] you become so far away from your own
[2:22:20] thinking
[2:22:21] till in your own mind i this you i don't
[2:22:25] don't let me try to explain that because
[2:22:28] i can't see i couldn't do it there is
[2:22:31] nobody could do it and that's the end
[2:22:36] that's all he says on the subject
[2:22:38] when the supernatural comes in that's
[2:22:41] the mind of christ
[2:22:43] and it causes you to be so far away from
[2:22:46] your own thinking in your own mind you
[2:22:49] have no no doubt you have no room
[2:22:51] except to reach up and say i'm accepting
[2:22:54] that as my very own aren't you glad god
[2:22:56] has equipped us
[2:22:58] let's stand together musicians are
[2:23:00] coming aren't you glad you have
[2:23:01] everything you need
[2:23:03] to arm you yourself
[2:23:07] the average person
[2:23:10] i don't know if you're average or not
[2:23:13] but the average person has between fifty
[2:23:15] thousand and seventy 000 thoughts each
[2:23:19] day
[2:23:20] 50 000 to 70 000 thoughts each day and
[2:23:23] most of those thoughts
[2:23:26] are automatic
[2:23:28] let me say it again because i want you
[2:23:30] to hear me
[2:23:33] the average person has between fifty
[2:23:35] thousand and seventy thousand thoughts
[2:23:37] each day
[2:23:38] most of which
[2:23:40] are automatic
[2:23:42] now they're not all negative
[2:23:44] but they're automatic
[2:23:47] unfortunately we know the biggest
[2:23:48] portion of them
[2:23:50] are often negative
[2:23:53] these are 50 to 70 000 thoughts the
[2:23:55] biggest portion of those thoughts
[2:23:58] automatic meaning we didn't have to dig
[2:24:01] them up or pull them back from memory
[2:24:04] they're just there and they come
[2:24:06] automatically
[2:24:07] now what we what we do with them once
[2:24:09] they come to our mind through the
[2:24:11] forefront of our mind what we do with
[2:24:13] them is up to you and up to me
[2:24:16] we have to do something
[2:24:18] and do you know what you should know
[2:24:20] about those 50 to 70 000 thoughts
[2:24:23] most of them
[2:24:25] you had yesterday
[2:24:32] and most of the thoughts that you had
[2:24:34] yesterday
[2:24:36] you had the day before
[2:24:39] we're talking about the automatic
[2:24:41] thoughts
[2:24:43] i'm telling you those are the ones we
[2:24:45] have to sometimes go after
[2:24:47] because those are the ones that become
[2:24:49] our identity
[2:24:51] i'm not talking about remembering how to
[2:24:53] brush your teeth
[2:24:54] i'm talking about all the thoughts that
[2:24:56] the enemy just want everybody to be
[2:24:58] still just a minute i'm not quite
[2:24:59] through
[2:25:02] those are the ones that we sometimes
[2:25:05] have to stop and say whoa
[2:25:10] the reason why it's sometimes difficult
[2:25:12] to do that is because we didn't mean to
[2:25:15] think it
[2:25:18] we didn't ask to think it
[2:25:22] we thought it
[2:25:23] automatically
[2:25:25] we're never going to get rid of it
[2:25:28] automatically
[2:25:30] it's going to repeat itself over and
[2:25:32] over and over again until you make up
[2:25:35] your mind to refuse it
[2:25:40] like sister william's key
[2:25:44] i'm not going there
[2:25:48] now that in itself
[2:25:50] will not keep it from coming back
[2:25:52] tomorrow
[2:25:54] but it'll help you not to go down the
[2:25:56] long slippery slope
[2:25:58] of all the thoughts that are connected
[2:26:00] to that one
[2:26:02] if you'd want to come to a place where
[2:26:04] you don't have to keep thinking that
[2:26:06] same one over and over again you must
[2:26:08] replace it
[2:26:10] and in order to replace it you have to
[2:26:12] do that with the mind of christ or with
[2:26:14] the word of god
[2:26:16] one that says the very opposite find you
[2:26:19] a truth
[2:26:21] that says the very opposite of what you
[2:26:24] have been thinking about yourself
[2:26:27] and stand on that as your promise
[2:26:31] and do it tomorrow
[2:26:33] and do it the next day
[2:26:36] and the next day
[2:26:37] until you have rewired
[2:26:41] and replaced
[2:26:43] an automatic negative thought
[2:26:46] with an automatic
[2:26:48] positive thought
[2:26:50] automatic thoughts are not the enemy
[2:26:52] automatic negative thoughts are
[2:26:55] how many of you would like to get to a
[2:26:56] place where you have reworked some of
[2:26:58] your thinking
[2:26:59] come on
[2:27:00] now and instead of automatically
[2:27:03] thinking i can't
[2:27:06] you automatically think of course i can
[2:27:08] do all things through christ's truth of
[2:27:10] course i can what do you mean i can't do
[2:27:12] of course i can i can do all things
[2:27:13] through christ who strengthens me
[2:27:15] see i i let the enemy defeat me recently
[2:27:18] over something kind of funny
[2:27:21] something not vitally important
[2:27:24] kind of a play thing
[2:27:25] i let the enemy defeat me and i thought
[2:27:27] i wished i would have just done what i
[2:27:28] knew to do i can do all things through
[2:27:31] christ's strength all things
[2:27:33] not just important things necessary even
[2:27:36] fun things
[2:27:39] i can do all things through christ who
[2:27:41] strengthens me
[2:27:42] see you wire that in i want you to know
[2:27:45] this is the way we're going to overcome
[2:27:47] in this hour arm yourselves
[2:27:50] with the same mind
[2:27:52] that christ was armed with
[2:27:55] we can overcome we have the victory
[2:27:58] i
[2:27:59] heard an old old story
[2:28:04] how a savior came
[2:28:07] from glory
[2:28:09] and i heard about

[2:29:27] to walk again
[2:29:30] and caused the blind to see
[2:29:34] oh and then i cried
