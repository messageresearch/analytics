[1:04:56] never called Jesus in the Bible when he
[1:05:00] was
[1:05:00] alive perhaps that's true because the
[1:05:03] name had not yet come about into
[1:05:07] existence someone said well his mother
[1:05:09] never called him Jesus because the name
[1:05:13] was never it hadn't been invented yet
[1:05:16] his Hebrew name was Yeshua or Yeshua
[1:05:20] which means
[1:05:21] salvation and I said that all May be
[1:05:24] true but I guarantee you he
[1:05:30] answers it it's not how you pronounce it
[1:05:34] it's not how you put the syllables
[1:05:36] together it's your heart that that he he
[1:05:38] responds to you may not worship like I
[1:05:42] do but but if you'll
[1:05:44] worship right he will respond to your
[1:05:48] heart I'm a happy man I'm just a happy

[1:13:40] believe in
[1:13:42] angels I'll tell you brother Brandon
[1:13:44] believed in
[1:13:46] angels He did I I think that we we
[1:13:49] printed one time we printed I think
[1:13:52] there were over 1100 100 pages of
[1:13:54] quotations where brother brandom talked
[1:13:56] about angels and you know one of the
[1:13:58] things he said about him he said you
[1:14:00] don't you don't have them you don't see
[1:14:02] them you don't sense them because you
[1:14:04] don't believe in them well I thought I'm
[1:14:06] going to just start believing in them
[1:14:09] and see if I can sense them coming in
[1:14:11] sometime you'll be surprised what'll
[1:14:14] happen to you if you'll start out
[1:14:16] walking on a supernatural Highway God is
[1:14:19] a supernatural God if you believe that
[1:14:22] say Amen amen I want us to thank the
[1:14:25] Lord for these musicians tonight the
[1:14:28] leading of the
[1:14:30] [Applause]
[1:14:34] worship Benjamin is my oldest son and he
[1:14:39] gets the same criticism that I used to
[1:14:41] get 30 years
[1:14:43] ago 30 years ago when I would sing
[1:14:46] they'd always asked me to sing wherever
[1:14:48] I went and and there would always be
[1:14:50] some in the crowd where he's just kind
[1:14:52] of putting on a show well I want to tell
[1:14:54] you something how that started I started
[1:14:57] singing in the church when my
[1:14:58] grandmother was still a pastor and she
[1:15:01] had a big old Gibson guitar with a long
[1:15:03] neck on it and she played the guitar and
[1:15:06] sung and one time she asked me to come
[1:15:10] and sing a song and I was just about
[1:15:11] that tall and I got up to sing and I
[1:15:14] wasn't putting enough in
[1:15:17] it she said you were just singing the
[1:15:19] words you didn't feel that you weren't
[1:15:22] trying to even identify with the words
[1:15:24] that's what she told me later there was
[1:15:26] no explanation at the
[1:15:29] time she just dipped the neck of that
[1:15:32] guitar back like that and whopped me
[1:15:34] right on the back of the
[1:15:37] head right in the service and I looked
[1:15:40] at her like big mama what in what is
[1:15:43] going on she said if you're going to do
[1:15:44] it for Jesus do every do it with
[1:15:45] everything you got or don't do it at
[1:15:48] all so sometimes people
[1:15:51] misunderstand and they think we're doing
[1:15:53] it for a show no we're doing it and
[1:15:55] putting everything we've got into it
[1:15:59] Hallelujah I'm not a sports
[1:16:02] fan but if I was I'd be one of the best
[1:16:06] I'm not a big football fan baseball
[1:16:08] basketball but if I was I'd be a fanatic
[1:16:12] yes sir because I wouldn't do anything I
[1:16:15] would go put my
[1:16:16] whole heart into it my whole energy into
[1:16:20] it we should serve God with all the
[1:16:23] strength that we have we should worship
[1:16:27] him we should praise him with all the
[1:16:31] strength that we have if you believe
[1:16:33] that say amen amen well God is good
[1:16:36] remain standing I want to take a text
[1:16:39] this evening I am a poor substitute for
[1:16:43] brother Dwayne Jackson he wanted to be
[1:16:46] here he was scheduled to be here this
[1:16:49] evening along with sister Heather and
[1:16:52] family and while we were away for
[1:16:55] Thanksgiving they had a little
[1:16:58] complication with sister Heather's
[1:17:00] pregnancy and the doctors felt like it
[1:17:03] was a good idea to stay in close
[1:17:06] proximity of the hospital and so while
[1:17:09] we were out one night uh on our holiday
[1:17:13] brother Dwayne called he said it's a
[1:17:14] hard call to make brother Shelly I I've
[1:17:17] only been preaching now for certain
[1:17:19] amount of time but he said I've I've
[1:17:20] never had to call a preacher and tell
[1:17:22] him couldn't come but it just don't look
[1:17:25] like it's going to work out we've
[1:17:27] already heard from them today their
[1:17:29] hearts are with us they would love to be
[1:17:32] here I'm believing that the Lord will
[1:17:35] make a way and he can come to our first
[1:17:37] uh weekend of February meetings it's in
[1:17:40] the Lord's hands and maybe bring baby
[1:17:42] girl with them you know and and we'll

[1:17:47] forward to that but uh it it it's my
[1:17:50] responsibility tonight to give you
[1:17:52] something
[1:17:53] and I believe I've I have something for
[1:17:55] you may be a little different but it's

[1:18:06] Church we have a different facility

[1:18:11] thankful that that churches are willing
[1:18:13] to help us out and let us come in with
[1:18:16] just a a minimal amount of rent just for
[1:18:19] little expense utility or something
[1:18:21] they're willing and we need it today and

[1:18:43] done you know brother Smith they didn't
[1:18:45] mention uh he he just I started to yell
[1:18:48] it out but I I'm bad to do that but that
[1:18:51] man's a miracle he's a walking Miracle
[1:18:54] you all were praying for him you all
[1:18:56] prayed for him and God heard everybody
[1:18:59] they were probably praying lots of
[1:19:00] places but God heard the prayer and
[1:19:03] raised him up nearly from the dead in
[1:19:05] the hospital give up and you know he's
[1:19:09] here tonight to praise God I saw him out

[1:19:45] in body but you're here with us in
[1:19:47] spirit your amens may not be heard in
[1:19:50] this house but they reverberate through
[1:19:52] their atmosphere I believe that with all
[1:19:55] my heart and and you're not saying amen
[1:19:57] for the preacher to hear you only you're
[1:19:59] saying amen because you're saying so be
[1:20:02] it to the word of God claiming and
[1:20:05] believing every promise for yourself
[1:20:08] Luke chapter 19 and verse 28 and when he
[1:20:11] had thus spoken he went before ascending
[1:20:15] up to
[1:20:16] Jerusalem and it came to pass when he
[1:20:19] was come nigh to Beth and Beth
[1:20:23] at the mount called the Mount of Olives
[1:20:26] he sent two of his disciples saying go
[1:20:30] ye into the village over against you in
[1:20:34] the which at your entering you shall
[1:20:36] find a Colt tied whereon yet never manat
[1:20:41] loose him and bring him hither and if
[1:20:45] any man ask you why do you loose him
[1:20:48] thus shall ye say unto him because the
[1:20:51] Lord hath need of him and they that that
[1:20:55] were sent went their way and found even
[1:20:59] as he had said unto them and as they
[1:21:03] were loosing the colat the owners
[1:21:06] thereof said unto them why loose she the
[1:21:09] colt and they said the Lord adoni hath
[1:21:13] need of him and they brought him to
[1:21:16] Jesus and they cast their garments upon
[1:21:19] the colt and they set Jesus thereon and
[1:21:23] as he went they spread their clothes in
[1:21:26] the way they took off their outer
[1:21:29] garments they took off their rain
[1:21:31] slickers they took off their their their
[1:21:35] overcoats whatever they had those outer
[1:21:37] tunics and they began to lay it in the
[1:21:40] path for the Lord's
[1:21:43] donkey to walk on and when he was come
[1:21:47] nigh even now at The Descent of the
[1:21:50] Mount of Olives and you know I stood
[1:21:52] stood right in the very area where this
[1:21:54] took place the whole multitude of the
[1:21:57] disciples began to rejoice and praise
[1:22:06] God it's getting too loud in here
[1:22:11] tonight they praise God with a loud
[1:22:16] voice a and what provoked them to do
[1:22:18] such a thing for all the mighty
[1:22:21] works you know why I'm going to praise
[1:22:23] him with a loud voice because these 48
[1:22:26] years I've served him and taken his
[1:22:29] gospel around the world I've seen Mighty
[1:22:32] Works done in his name and if anybody
[1:22:35] ever had a right to praise God the Bride
[1:22:37] of Jesus Christ ought to step up and
[1:22:39] take our rights to praise him it's we're
[1:22:44] not after leodan rights we're not after
[1:22:46] the people's rights we're after the
[1:22:48] rights that are given to the children of
[1:22:50] God I heard brother Brandon say today
[1:22:54] that the first church was a church full
[1:22:55] of Power full of Holy
[1:22:57] Ghost and he said the last church is
[1:23:00] going to be exactly like the first
[1:23:05] church I know it I don't just believe it
[1:23:10] I know it for they uh all began with a
[1:23:13] loud voice some to praise God for the
[1:23:15] mighty works that they had seen let's
[1:23:19] get the rest of these verses in saying
[1:23:21] blessed be the king that cometh in the
[1:23:25] name of the Lord baruk bashem bar bashem

[1:24:20] chicken and put it on my plate
[1:24:23] yeah I guarantee you Granny didn't wear
[1:24:26] gloves when she throwed the biscuits
[1:24:28] around the table but my wife said you

[1:24:32] serve they don't have gloves they washed
[1:24:34] their hands and clean real good and I
[1:24:35] said if there are any Pharisees here

[1:24:39] explain to you and and there's always
[1:24:41] going to be a Pharisee around somebody's
[1:24:44] going to say oh the the tongues was

[1:25:20] multitude said unto him Pastor rebuke
[1:25:23] thy disciples call them back into church
[1:25:29] order make sure they hear that tape
[1:25:32] again and he answered and said unto them

[1:25:42] ahead if these should hold their peace
[1:25:46] the
[1:25:47] stones the very rocks on the ground

[1:27:02] quotations some of you are familiar with
[1:27:04] these I use quotes almost every service
[1:27:08] but there are some services that I don't
[1:27:11] and I don't think it's always
[1:27:14] necessary what gets on my nerves is when
[1:27:17] I hear preachers say uh something like
[1:27:19] this brother brandham said for God so
[1:27:22] love the
[1:27:25] world or or or they'll say brother
[1:27:27] Brandon and they'll quote another
[1:27:29] scripture how many of you know that you
[1:27:31] don't have to give brother brandom
[1:27:33] credit for what the Bible
[1:27:37] says you see there seems to be some
[1:27:39] confusion Among Us of what the absolute
[1:27:42] is but he had no
[1:27:45] confusion he held up the Bible he said
[1:27:48] it's got to line up with this if it
[1:27:51] doesn't line up with this you got to
[1:27:53] leave it alone don't try to figure it
[1:27:56] out am just put it on a shelf and let
[1:27:59] God interpret you know what God
[1:28:01] interprets his word by bringing it to
[1:28:04] pass to pass he doesn't need you and I
[1:28:07] to interpret he knows how to perform it
[1:28:10] he knows how to do it anybody with me
[1:28:12] tonight good he said wait till that
[1:28:16] satisfaction
[1:28:19] comes some people are restless
[1:28:23] they don't ever seem to be
[1:28:25] satisfied but the prophet said wait till
[1:28:27] that satisfaction comes the satisfaction
[1:28:30] portion yeah of the
[1:28:33] fullness somebody Say fullness fullness
[1:28:36] of the Holy Spirit comes in wait till
[1:28:39] the fullness comes in amen and then

[1:28:49] these we better check the dat
[1:28:59] 65 seals are open come on mystery
[1:29:05] revealed and brother brandom is still
[1:29:07] telling us when the fullness of the Holy
[1:29:11] Spirit comes
[1:29:12] in then then somebody say then then
[1:29:17] these Joy bells of
[1:29:19] shouting I thought that was all just
[1:29:22] Pentecostal F but not according to
[1:29:25] brother random here he said when the
[1:29:26] real fullness of the Holy Spirit the
[1:29:29] satisfying portion is anybody got a
[1:29:33] satisfying portion that doesn't mean you
[1:29:36] won't ever hunger anymore it means once
[1:29:39] you get the real nothing but the real
[1:29:41] will ever satisfy you stay with me now

[1:29:55] amen I need
[1:29:57] water speaking in
[1:30:00] tongues

[1:30:06] finished I I I I thought that once the
[1:30:09] revelation of the word came all these
[1:30:11] gifts were done away with then why is
[1:30:15] brother brandham telling us in in
[1:30:18] September of
[1:30:20] 1965 that we still have to have the
[1:30:23] satisfying portion of the fullness of
[1:30:26] the Holy Spirit and when it comes in
[1:30:28] it'll bring the joy bells of shouting
[1:30:31] and speaking in tongues and
[1:30:36] [Applause]

[1:30:42] thing on your phone that it says up
[1:30:45] here amen dancing in the spirit dancing
[1:30:51] in the spirit I thought that was
[1:30:52] Pentecostal F I thought that was for
[1:30:55] babes I thought we are beyond that isn't
[1:30:58] that what I've heard for about 30 years
[1:31:00] now we're beyond that we now have the
[1:31:04] word then why do we hear Brother brandom
[1:31:06] telling us in 65 we've got to have the
[1:31:09] reality of the satisfying portion of the
[1:31:12] fullness of the Holy Spirit and when he
[1:31:15] comes there will be Joy bells of
[1:31:17] shouting and speaking in tongues and
[1:31:20] dancing in the spirit
[1:31:23] [Applause]
[1:31:25] will
[1:31:28] come Benny says you won't have to do it
[1:31:31] by the music and that is
[1:31:33] absolutely 100%
[1:31:36] correct you won't have to have the music
[1:31:39] playing to
[1:31:41] dance there's nothing wrong with dancing
[1:31:44] in the spirit while the music is playing
[1:31:46] but if that's the inspiration if the
[1:31:49] beat of the drum or the trill of the
[1:31:51] piano it's your inspiration for dancing
[1:31:54] you're just putting on a show but if the
[1:31:56] holy spirit is moving over you and you
[1:31:59] don't yield to the Holy Spirit you're in
[1:32:02] Rebellion against
[1:32:03] God to sit there on the Pew and not
[1:32:06] yield yourself to the Holy
[1:32:10] Spirit you're worse than a disobedient
[1:32:13] child we're operating in witchcraft
[1:32:16] around this message sometime come on
[1:32:18] come on why because the Bible said
[1:32:20] stubborn spirit
[1:32:24] stubborn Spirit I'm not going to be
[1:32:29] mov and then sometimes they get this
[1:32:32] attitude I'm not going to get happy cuz
[1:32:34] they
[1:32:36] do we're not your enemy we're your
[1:32:41] [Music]
[1:32:42] brother don't don't resist because we go
[1:32:46] overboard you keep it right between the
[1:32:50] you keep it right between the ditches is
[1:32:52] walk in the middle of the road if you
[1:32:54] see some excess if you see somebody
[1:32:56] getting a little carried away don't you
[1:32:58] get distracted by that don't you get
[1:33:01] your eyes on somebody else and whatever
[1:33:03] you do don't judge nobody else's
[1:33:07] praise cuz brother brandom said
[1:33:10] gone he said done gone you blasphemed
[1:33:14] the Holy Ghost now that's dangerous
[1:33:16] business so if somebody comes twisting
[1:33:19] by you and you don't think that it's
[1:33:21] just right close your eyes turn your
[1:33:26] head the other way don't you let a
[1:33:28] thought come to your mind against that
[1:33:31] because you first of all you don't know
[1:33:34] what that brother's been
[1:33:39] through I don't want to bring any
[1:33:41] attention to this but I saw a brother
[1:33:43] back there praising the Lord with his
[1:33:46] hands up when just a few weeks ago he
[1:33:48] laid his wife to rest he is raising nine
[1:33:51] children and I want you to know he
[1:33:53] didn't come today to Fellowship all
[1:33:56] broken down he didn't come with a sad
[1:33:58] sour look on his face he come in smiling
[1:34:02] when I greeted him he greeted me with
[1:34:04] the biggest smile you've just about ever
[1:34:07] seen and when I look back he was
[1:34:09] praising the Lord let me tell you
[1:34:11] something we're not praising God because
[1:34:14] everything always goes just
[1:34:17] right or we feel good or we don't have
[1:34:20] an ache or we don't have a
[1:34:22] we're praising him because he's
[1:34:25] worthy somebody ought to help me he's
[1:34:29] worthy well it makes me nervous when
[1:34:31] everybody starts doing that you're in
[1:34:33] bad shape
[1:34:36] amen you either need a pill or a prayer
[1:34:40] line if you're so nervous at somebody
[1:34:43] getting a little excited in the spirit
[1:34:45] is going to throw you into the despairs
[1:34:47] of
[1:34:49] anxiety something's terribly wrong with
[1:34:51] with your your Revelation something is
[1:34:54] terribly wrong with your experience get
[1:34:57] your eyes off of one another get your
[1:35:00] eyes on Jesus worship is not a
[1:35:03] performance praise is not a performance
[1:35:05] it's a sincere relationship between you
[1:35:08] and God and and don't you find yourself
[1:35:10] moving because the music is moving you
[1:35:12] find yourself moving because the spirit
[1:35:14] is
[1:35:16] moving 30 years ago they blackballed

[1:40:12] but I'd say it's still
[1:40:15] inspired it's a good one paragraph 27
[1:40:18] God he that comes to you empty
[1:40:22] that was my prayer for this service
[1:40:24] tonight and tomorrow that every person
[1:40:27] who comes may feel a little
[1:40:30] drained physically emotionally
[1:40:34] spiritually your troubles your trials
[1:40:36] your problems may have drained your tank
[1:40:39] but I have prayed and others have prayed
[1:40:42] that before you leave these grounds your

[1:40:47] renewed your faith is inspired and your
[1:40:51] ready to go fight the last battle

[1:40:54] one you know he said God he that comes
[1:40:57] to you empty will go away fool you
[1:41:00] promised it and I pray that you will
[1:41:02] fill their hearts and their baskets of
[1:41:06] their souls so full of the good things
[1:41:09] of God that they'll go away just
[1:41:12] bubbling over with joy
[1:41:15] unspeakable and full of Glory Hallelujah
[1:41:19] he goes on to say
[1:41:23] just may the cups of these precious
[1:41:27] people run over with spiritual and good
[1:41:32] things from God let the Saints say Amen
[1:41:35] one more seven Church ages the original
[1:41:38] preaching of these Church ages not Dr
[1:41:41] Vil's book paragraph 73 now as God
[1:41:46] poured out the Mana there in the natural
[1:41:49] and it lasted as long as they were in
[1:41:51] the journey a beautiful type and the day
[1:41:54] they entered the promised land the Mana
[1:41:56] ceased and on the day of Pentecost the
[1:41:59] same thing look at Pentecost to Moses
[1:42:03] they look back and they seen the enemy
[1:42:05] was dead and I want you to look what
[1:42:11] happened Miriam grabbed are you still
[1:42:15] here Miry grabbed a
[1:42:18] tambourine Hallelujah a
[1:42:24] woman a
[1:42:27] woman a woman come on Miriam grabbed a
[1:42:31] tambourine and began to beat
[1:42:37] it and scam
[1:42:41] scream and
[1:42:45] dance I was down there at Shel and they
[1:42:48] ran around the pews if you you'd have
[1:42:51] been there on the Red Sea Shore you'd
[1:42:53] have seen some of the same kind of
[1:42:54] behavior
[1:42:56] Hallelujah and for the same reason our
[1:43:00] Pharaoh is behind us our slavery is done
[1:43:04] we are no longer slaves we are Sons we
[1:43:08] are stepping into the full adoption of
[1:43:11] sons we've got a
[1:43:14] reason to beat a tambourine to scream a
[1:43:17] little to dance and run down the bank
[1:43:20] the women followed her doing the same
[1:43:23] thing and Moses the pastor threw up his
[1:43:26] hands and rebuked
[1:43:32] them didn't Moses call the deacons
[1:43:38] sir you ever been in a meeting where
[1:43:41] they I have I have and you know how I
[1:43:45] feel when I'm in an atmosphere like that
[1:43:47] if if the Holy Ghost didn't welcome here
[1:43:52] that's right don't invite
[1:43:53] me because if the Holy Ghost didn't
[1:43:56] welcome to run the church if the Holy
[1:43:59] Ghost didn't welcome to come and move
[1:44:00] Among Us I don't I'm not welcome either
[1:44:03] I have no desire to be where the Holy
[1:44:05] Ghost doesn't want to go because people
[1:44:07] haven't made him welcome they began to
[1:44:09] Moses Moses threw up his hands but he
[1:44:11] didn't rebuke them he didn't call for
[1:44:13] the deacons to remove them guess what
[1:44:14] Moses did Holy Ghost wasn't even poured
[1:44:17] out yet and Moses began to sing and
[1:44:20] prophesy in the
[1:44:22] spirit oh my sing a song uh a beautiful
[1:44:26] song let's let's finish that one at
[1:44:29] Pentecost the women came
[1:44:32] out but I thought it was just men that
[1:44:34] got touched by Pentecost evidently not
[1:44:38] because brother brandom tells us here
[1:44:40] the women come out staggering and
[1:44:41] jumping and dancing and and don't you
[1:44:44] Brothers think that this let you off the
[1:44:47] hook because you get a little Holy Ghost
[1:44:49] stirring in you and you respond as well
[1:44:53] you can't grab a hold of a live wire and
[1:44:55] not be
[1:44:57] moved that's right jumping and dancing
[1:45:00] and carrying on Peter stood up in the
[1:45:02] midst of them and said you men of Judea
[1:45:03] and you that dwell in Jerusalem let this
[1:45:05] be known unto you and hearken to my
[1:45:07] words for these are not drunk as you
[1:45:09] suppose so so some people begin to write
[1:45:11] on social media they say oh do you
[1:45:13] really think the disciples worship like
[1:45:17] that well I don't know what they did
[1:45:19] before the day of pentec
[1:45:21] but on the day of Pentecost I know
[1:45:23] exactly how they worship they staggered
[1:45:25] around like drunk men speaking in other
[1:45:27] tongues and they behaved in such a way
[1:45:29] that the naysayers said these men have
[1:45:31] been dipping in the wine and it's just
[1:45:33] early in the morning and they're already
[1:45:35] intoxicated so somebody was under the
[1:45:38] influence of something and let me tell
[1:45:40] you something if only the music
[1:45:42] stimulates
[1:45:43] us then something's wrong but if you get
[1:45:47] a stimulation from the word you see
[1:45:49] every now and again somebody jumps up in
[1:45:51] here under the inspiration of the
[1:45:54] word and and ever now and again somebody
[1:45:56] throws up their hand and ever now and
[1:45:58] again somebody squeezes out an amen
[1:46:01] because they're being stimulated by the
[1:46:03] word and they're saying so be it so let
[1:46:06] the main source of your of your
[1:46:09] stimulation be from the word from the
[1:46:11] revelation of the word from the message
[1:46:13] that you have heard from the truth that
[1:46:15] has already been revealed to you amen
[1:46:18] don't let it come from the song
[1:46:22] and they said well message Believers
[1:46:24] didn't write all these
[1:46:26] songs so we might not ought to be
[1:46:28] singing are you kidding
[1:46:30] me message Believers didn't write
[1:46:33] Amazing Grace but that'll work for you
[1:46:34] won't
[1:46:36] it let me tell you
[1:46:39] something do you know how the
[1:46:41] traditional Church felt when when the
[1:46:44] zeusa street came and and people began
[1:46:46] to sing these little choruses under the
[1:46:48] inspiration of the Holy Spirit and they
[1:46:50] repeated the line over and over again
[1:46:52] he's alive he's alive the Holy Ghost is
[1:46:54] alive he's alive he's alive Holy Ghost
[1:46:56] is alive and they begin to sing it over
[1:46:57] and over again and the traditional
[1:46:59] Christians begin to call them African
[1:47:01] dides and they said these are little
[1:47:03] African diddies that they've picked up
[1:47:04] from the tribes of the of the Dark
[1:47:07] Continent and this is not how worship
[1:47:09] ought to be and this is not how because
[1:47:11] it wasn't something written by
[1:47:14] Wesley and we've got a lot of folks even
[1:47:16] around the message today if a song is
[1:47:18] written after 1965
[1:47:22] live they don't think it could possibly
[1:47:24] have any inspiration on it at all or
[1:47:27] because somebody sung it listen maybe
[1:47:29] somebody wrote it that's got lips
[1:47:33] [Music]
[1:47:34] painted and you don't understand do you
[1:47:37] don't you understand what he taught us
[1:47:38] about how the how the anointing Falls it
[1:47:41] falls on the just and the
[1:47:43] unjust you just let me take somebody
[1:47:46] who's got an inspiration and written a
[1:47:48] song I'm not interested in how they've
[1:47:50] got their lips done I'm not interested
[1:47:52] in whether they've been to the beauty
[1:47:53] part or not if that word that's in that
[1:47:55] song speaks to my heart and stirs me up
[1:47:59] I'm not going to follow their
[1:48:02] lifestyle if Billy Graham preaches the
[1:48:05] truth I'm going to amen what Billy
[1:48:06] Graham said if it's the
[1:48:09] truth somebody said I can't go to these
[1:48:12] places and hear these singers sing
[1:48:13] because they don't live like we live let
[1:48:15] me tell you something that doesn't mean
[1:48:17] you can't be blessed by the gift that's
[1:48:19] been placed in their
[1:48:21] life folks are becoming Pharisees and
[1:48:24] missing out on a
[1:48:25] blessing the song many of the songs that
[1:48:28] you heard tonight have been written
[1:48:30] since
[1:48:32] 1965 I love the
[1:48:35] hymns my children will tell you I'm more
[1:48:38] comfortable with with a southern gospel
[1:48:43] sound that's what I grew up on that's
[1:48:45] what they're going to play in
[1:48:49] heaven
[1:48:54] I'll come over ever now and again and
[1:48:56] visit you over in contemporary music
[1:48:58] heaven but I'm going to hang out over on
[1:49:01] the stormy Banks of God's
[1:49:03] Deliverance I'm going to hang out over
[1:49:05] there where I can relate to it the most
[1:49:08] but you know what the Holy Ghost taught
[1:49:09] me about it it's not whether it suits
[1:49:12] you or
[1:49:13] not praise is not about you praise is
[1:49:18] not about me worship is not about the
[1:49:24] church somebody help me worship is about
[1:49:28] him if it exalts him if it lifts him up
[1:49:32] if it blesses the Lord if it gives his
[1:49:35] name
[1:49:37] [Applause]
[1:49:40] glory amen and even if it's a little
[1:49:44] more
[1:49:45] modern oh I hear them
[1:49:49] raging I'm just going to keep on
[1:49:52] praising I can't get caught up I can't
[1:49:54] get distracted I got to just keep on
[1:49:56] praising you men of Judea and you'll
[1:49:58] dwell in Jerusalem let it be known unto
[1:50:00] you hearken my words these are not drunk
[1:50:02] as you suppos sing is the third hour of
[1:50:04] the day come on this is that which was
[1:50:07] spoken of by the prophet Joel it shall
[1:50:08] come to pass the last day sayith God
[1:50:10] I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[1:50:12] your sons and your daughters shall
[1:50:13] prophesy upon my handmaids w that's the
[1:50:16] women and made servants will I pour out
[1:50:18] my spirit
[1:50:20] come
[1:50:20] [Music]
[1:50:23] on Miriam wasn't the only
[1:50:26] one what's the rest
[1:50:29] say is that all give me the rest of it

[1:50:34] heavens above and in the earth below
[1:50:35] pillars of fire and vapor and smoke and
[1:50:37] it shall come to pass before the great
[1:50:38] and terrible day of the Lord shall come
[1:50:40] that whosoever should call upon the name
[1:50:41] of the Lord shall be saved on and on he
[1:50:44] went preaching under the inspiration of
[1:50:47] the Holy Ghost come on now now I want to
[1:50:51] do a little teaching tonight are you
[1:50:52] ready there are nine Hebrew words write
[1:50:55] it down you that are note takers there
[1:50:58] are nine Hebrew words that I want to
[1:50:59] talk about tonight and what I don't
[1:51:01] finish tonight I'll talk about in the
[1:51:03] morning there are nine Hebrew words that
[1:51:06] are translated it's I know it says seven
[1:51:08] there uh I forgot to correct it thank
[1:51:11] you uh I I I I found a couple more got
[1:51:15] brave enough to slip them in there are
[1:51:17] nine Hebrew words translated at praise
[1:51:20] in the Old Testament and analyzing these
[1:51:23] seven words broadens our understanding
[1:51:26] of the full meaning of Praise how many
[1:51:28] of you'd like to have a full
[1:51:30] meaning amen praise is not what we
[1:51:33] create and what we make it there is a
[1:51:37] Bible precedent for praise if it's not
[1:51:41] Bible praise I don't know anything about
[1:51:43] it we're looking for Bible praise is
[1:51:46] that right so number one you that are
[1:51:48] keeping notes number one the word is
[1:51:53] Hal now sometimes we say
[1:51:56] Halal but the word is halal Halal or L
[1:52:03] it's the most common Hebrew word in the
[1:52:05] Bible for praise and it
[1:52:08] appears 165 times in the Old Testament
[1:52:14] and in most cases it is translated as
[1:52:18] praise it's the most common of all the
[1:52:21] words and Halal means to
[1:52:25] flash it means to radiate or shine I
[1:52:30] don't have that on a
[1:52:31] slide it means to flash it means to
[1:52:34] radiate or shine it means to flash forth
[1:52:40] light to shine like the new moon did you
[1:52:45] know there were some new moon shining in
[1:52:47] here tonight and you don't have to worry
[1:52:50] about them because they have no light of
[1:52:52] their own the only light they can Flash
[1:52:55] forth is the light of the Sun the moon
[1:52:58] reflects the light of the s o n when
[1:53:01] we're talking about the bride so you can
[1:53:03] flash your light just shine children of
[1:53:06] God shine sister April shine when you
[1:53:09] get under the inspiration of the Holy
[1:53:11] Spirit Austin ha just
[1:53:13] shine
[1:53:15] shine flash that
[1:53:17] light you know what it means to make a
[1:53:19] show
[1:53:24] you're making that up it means it not
[1:53:26] making it up it means to make a show or
[1:53:29] boasting you know what's all right to
[1:53:31] boast if you're boasting on the
[1:53:34] Lord to glory in to be CL oh this is
[1:53:38] going to get
[1:53:39] you I don't want to lose all all h
[1:53:42] similitude of order but but this is what
[1:53:45] it means halel
[1:53:46] means
[1:53:48] to uh clam to to be to be
[1:53:53] clamorously
[1:53:54] clamorously
[1:53:58] foolish some of you is doing
[1:54:01] [Music]
[1:54:02] good it means to go about in a
[1:54:09] raging or raving
[1:54:13] way somebody said that that that that
[1:54:16] brother there was just like a bull in a
[1:54:18] China closet
[1:54:20] then he has embraced the base root
[1:54:24] meaning of the word
[1:54:28] halel it doesn't mean he knocks
[1:54:31] everybody
[1:54:32] over it doesn't mean that he acts so
[1:54:35] crazy that all the attention is drawn on
[1:54:37] him but it means that when he Praises he
[1:54:41] is more concerned about letting God be
[1:54:44] glorified than how he
[1:54:47] looks the example I want to give you is
[1:54:51] there's a lot of
[1:54:54] me I'm waiting on the amen there's a lot
[1:54:58] of me I got a lot of pounds
[1:55:00] here and if I had much
[1:55:03] pride I would be very concerned about
[1:55:07] what I look like when I praise the
[1:55:09] [Music]
[1:55:11] Lord but when I
[1:55:14] surrender to praise
[1:55:17] him sometimes it may be a little CL
[1:55:19] ously
[1:55:21] foolish it might look like a lot of meat
[1:55:24] in motion to some
[1:55:27] people but I'm not doing it for you to
[1:55:30] look at
[1:55:32] me if you're looking at me you're
[1:55:34] looking at the wrong thing I'm not going
[1:55:37] to let anything hold me back from giving
[1:55:41] God
[1:55:42] Hal to go about in a raging or raving
[1:55:46] way let me read the rest to act mad
[1:55:51] ly you ever seen anybody get that
[1:55:53] serious about praise somebody said
[1:55:56] someone sent a note and said I was
[1:55:57] streaming one of your services and I
[1:55:59] caught a hold of somebody a glance of
[1:56:01] somebody and they look like they were
[1:56:03] mad they were praising the Lord but they
[1:56:05] look
[1:56:07] militant they look like they were going
[1:56:09] at it almost in a mad way that's
[1:56:13] Hal some of you will never see that in
[1:56:16] your
[1:56:18] lifetime some of you watching this
[1:56:21] service will never see somebody get to
[1:56:23] that place where praise becomes so
[1:56:26] serious for them that it's a war
[1:56:29] raging but I have and I'm comfortable in
[1:56:33] that
[1:56:34] realm it means to to uh act madly it
[1:56:38] means to dance it means to celebrate it
[1:56:41] speaks of Jubilation halel 165 times
[1:56:45] translated praise halel is a primary
[1:56:49] root word for praise our word
[1:56:52] [Music]
[1:56:54] halah
[1:56:56] halel is
[1:56:58] hallelujah so our word hallelujah comes
[1:57:02] from the Hebrew word praise Hal are you
[1:57:05] with me yes sir it means to be
[1:57:09] clear to praise to shine to boast to
[1:57:14] show to Rave to celebrate and as
[1:57:19] mentioned a moment
[1:57:21] ago to sometimes make a fool of
[1:57:25] oneself halel is often used in the
[1:57:28] plural carrying the implication of a
[1:57:31] group of people coming together to
[1:57:33] praise God's greatness as one unit does
[1:57:36] that sound good to you now let's flash
[1:57:39] these scriptures up just as fast as we
[1:57:41] can I ought to get some help there's so
[1:57:44] many of them to read Psalms
[1:57:46] 56:4 in God I will will
[1:57:50] praise
[1:57:53] halel in God I will praise halel His
[1:57:58] word in God I have put my trust I will
[1:58:02] not fear what
[1:58:05] flesh what man can do unto me I'm going
[1:58:10] to praise if it cost me something I'm
[1:58:13] going to praise if it makes me an enemy
[1:58:15] I will not fear what man what flesh can
[1:58:18] do unto me because when I come to praise
[1:58:20] I come to
[1:58:22] halel Psalm 1493 let them praise halel
[1:58:27] His name in the in the dance let them
[1:58:32] sing
[1:58:34] praises with the timberl and harp Psalm
[1:58:39] 15012 praise
[1:58:42] halel ye the Lord praise halel God in
[1:58:48] his sanctuary
[1:58:50] Praise halel Him in the firmament of his
[1:58:54] power praise halel him for his mighty
[1:58:58] acts Praise halel Him according to his
[1:59:03] excellent
[1:59:04] greatness Psalm 113 1-3 praise halel ye
[1:59:11] the Lord Praise halel oh ye Servants of
[1:59:15] the Lord praise halel the name of the
[1:59:19] Lord now what did that mean it meant to
[1:59:22] shine it meant to radiate it meant to
[1:59:25] Rave or to
[1:59:29] rage it meant to
[1:59:31] exuberantly with
[1:59:33] Jubilation anybody with me I'm not
[1:59:36] feeling it just now praise the Lord
[1:59:40] that's what it means now are you going
[1:59:42] to choose the Bible
[1:59:45] Way on are you going to let the Bible be
[1:59:48] your inspiration yes are you going to
[1:59:50] let somebody talk you out of Praise
[1:59:53] because the church has found a a a a
[1:59:54] more dignified
[1:59:58] way when I was in the filled with the
[2:00:01] Holy Ghost and birthed out of Pentecost
[2:00:03] the people lifted their hands like
[2:00:05] this they knew what lifting the hands
[2:00:07] means it means a full surrender but I
[2:00:10] want you to know as the word went out
[2:00:11] the door and the Holy Ghost begin to
[2:00:13] leave the Pentecostal
[2:00:16] movement come
[2:00:18] on
[2:00:20] that's
[2:00:21] right I started seeing the worship hands
[2:00:23] get a little lower and lower lower until
[2:00:25] now you go to Charismatic
[2:00:30] Church they look like they're trying to
[2:00:32] live something
[2:00:33] up you are your burden you're supposed
[2:00:38] to be lifting up the Lord you don't need
[2:00:41] him down here you need him up there are
[2:00:43] you really telling brother Shel are you
[2:00:46] really telling me how to raise my
[2:00:48] hands
[2:00:51] H I'm just telling you what the Bible
[2:00:53] said he didn't say raise your hands Any
[2:00:56] Way You Want
[2:00:57] To Praise any way you want to the Bible
[2:01:00] doesn't say any old praise will
[2:01:03] do the Bible doesn't say praise him the
[2:01:06] way you feel
[2:01:07] comfortable Praise Him according to your
[2:01:09] color type or your personality type
[2:01:11] praise him this way if you're an
[2:01:13] introvert and that way if you're an
[2:01:15] extrovert the Bible said praise
[2:01:18] Hal exuberantly Jubilation flash radiate
[2:01:23] shine are you with
[2:01:25] me praise Hal ye the Lord Praise halel
[2:01:28] oh ye Servants of the Lord Praise Hal
[2:01:30] the name of the Lord blessed be the name
[2:01:32] of the Lord from this time forth and
[2:01:34] forever more from the rising of the sun
[2:01:36] unto the going down of the same the
[2:01:38] lord's name is to be praised to be
[2:01:42] praised now a good a good
[2:01:45] reference for what this kind of Praise
[2:01:48] looks like is found in 2 Samuel we're
[2:01:50] not going there but in 2 Samuel chapter
[2:01:52] 6 the word halel is not used there
[2:01:55] because the word praise is not the
[2:01:58] emphasis but it described the definition
[2:02:01] of halel is a perfect description of how
[2:02:04] David
[2:02:07] was when he began to praise the Lord he
[2:02:10] took off his Royal
[2:02:12] garment I don't want to just Praise Him
[2:02:15] in my in my position I want to praise
[2:02:17] him because of his position position so
[2:02:20] he took off his Royal garment if you
[2:02:23] study that in the Hebrew it looks like
[2:02:25] that he went all the way down to to what
[2:02:29] would be considered today an
[2:02:32] undercloak it is certainly not something
[2:02:34] you would go out in public with it was
[2:02:37] not
[2:02:38] indecent it did not expose the the the
[2:02:42] the private parts of his body but it was
[2:02:45] not what you would go to the restaurant
[2:02:46] in it was not what you would go to town
[2:02:49] in but David got so carried away don't
[2:02:52] you do
[2:02:56] this you know you got always got to do
[2:02:58] the disclaimers for some
[2:03:01] folks I don't want you praising him in
[2:03:04] your
[2:03:06] undershirt not in here Praise Him in
[2:03:08] your undershirt at home come on Praise
[2:03:11] Him in your undershirt at home praise
[2:03:13] him on the bed Praise Him in the
[2:03:16] car amen but David just guy he got under
[2:03:20] such an inspiration he just wanted to
[2:03:22] give lay everything out of the way I
[2:03:23] just want to lay everything out of the
[2:03:25] way to magnify the name of the Lord
[2:03:27] somebody say halel Hal I want to hear
[2:03:29] you say halel Hal it's
[2:03:32] praise it's a beautiful form of Praise
[2:03:35] number
[2:03:36] two yada in English or Y in Hebrew it's
[2:03:42] used 114 times in the Old Testament
[2:03:45] 114 times although it is not always
[2:03:49] translated in English as praise it means
[2:03:53] to
[2:03:55] throw to
[2:03:57] thrust to cast away
[2:04:01] from it means hands
[2:04:04] outward it means to throw out of the
[2:04:09] hand on can you see the
[2:04:13] picture should I throw
[2:04:17] something
[2:04:20] to
[2:04:22] show the kids are growing up you know
[2:04:25] and they're always walking around the
[2:04:25] room throwing a football when they don't
[2:04:27] even have a football in their
[2:04:29] hand
[2:04:32] boys well there's a Hebrew word for
[2:04:35] that y used 114 times in the Old
[2:04:39] Testament not always translated as
[2:04:42] praise to throw to thrust to Cast Away
[2:04:45] hands outward to throw out the hand to
[2:04:47] throw hands into the air therefore to
[2:04:49] worship with an extension of the
[2:04:53] hand the opposite of the word
[2:04:57] Y is a word that means to ring the hands
[2:05:01] in
[2:05:02] anxiety and worry have you ever done
[2:05:06] it I'm preaching to you I'm asking you a
[2:05:09] question has anybody ever rung their
[2:05:12] hands maybe not even physically but just
[2:05:15] emotionally you you just carried about
[2:05:17] as much as you can
[2:05:19] and you're under such a load and you're
[2:05:20] so worried there's a remedy for that
[2:05:22] there's a remedy for your anxiety
[2:05:24] there's a remedy for your nervous
[2:05:26] condition there's a remedy for your
[2:05:28] panic attacks there's a remedy for your
[2:05:31] worry spells Kell come on now y do to
[2:05:35] thrust the hands toward the maker of
[2:05:39] heaven and
[2:05:41] Earth that's
[2:05:46] right like I told you here Tuesday 9 and
[2:05:49] I'll soon be off of this praise I was
[2:05:50] going to stop in no just do it all
[2:05:52] November but I'm carrying over just a
[2:05:54] little bit you don't even have to say
[2:05:56] anything when you throw your hands in
[2:05:58] the air you're a child of God you're a
[2:06:01] holy ghost filled believer you're a son
[2:06:03] of the most high God you may not even
[2:06:05] have words to say you may be under such
[2:06:07] a pressure and such a load that you
[2:06:09] can't even articulate
[2:06:13] words and he
[2:06:15] knows your do say it your do he knows it
[2:06:19] he knows what it's about did you notice
[2:06:22] it it's like it's the same word that's
[2:06:23] used for throwing a stone
[2:06:26] away I've got these crazy tennis shoes
[2:06:29] they are so uh they don't call them
[2:06:30] tennis shoes anymore what do they call
[2:06:31] them now sneakers who would call a PA
[2:06:34] parir of Sho
[2:06:37] sneakers that is so
[2:06:39] odd Yankees that's right there you go
[2:06:42] spoken right out of the mouth of of an
[2:06:44] next
[2:06:45] one
[2:06:47] sneakers we we called them tennis shoes
[2:06:49] never played
[2:06:51] tennis what else do they call them
[2:06:54] sometime kicks you all are trying to
[2:06:57] make me cool you come way too
[2:07:00] late but I got a parent they're so
[2:07:02] comfortable they bounce they make you
[2:07:04] feel so good when you put them on but
[2:07:07] they've got such big grooves in the hill
[2:07:09] that I I get rocks in
[2:07:12] them the rocks stick up in there and
[2:07:15] then I go walk on the wood floor and I
[2:07:16] can feel it in the wood floor and so I
[2:07:18] just all these aggravating things and I
[2:07:20] reach down and I pick that rock out and
[2:07:22] I go to the door and I throw it on the
[2:07:25] gravel that is the same kind of of
[2:07:28] interpretation of this word it's the
[2:07:31] same demonstration of this word if
[2:07:33] you've got a burden if you're carrying
[2:07:35] something that displeases you if you're
[2:07:37] carrying a weight or a load or a
[2:07:39] heaviness that you don't want to carry
[2:07:41] anymore throw up your hands sling away
[2:07:44] your burden come on sling away that
[2:07:47] which is getting on your nerve throw it
[2:07:49] away and give God praise that's what y
[2:07:52] do means 2 Chronicles
[2:07:56] 20:21 uh charity and when he had
[2:07:59] consulted with the
[2:08:00] people he appointed singers unto the
[2:08:03] Lord do you remember this that they
[2:08:05] should praise I mean appointed
[2:08:08] praisers on I I I mean licensed
[2:08:12] praisers we need some of them in our
[2:08:15] churches cuz it's just a fact that
[2:08:18] everybody is not going to praise the
[2:08:19] Lord so maybe we need to appoint some
[2:08:22] praiser we we appoint we appoint Prayer
[2:08:24] Warriors and and and alter teams and and
[2:08:27] deacons and trustees and whatever maybe
[2:08:29] we just should do what David did and
[2:08:31] just appoint some folks to sing praises
[2:08:33] to the Lord and this is such a beautiful
[2:08:36] expression here it says that uh
[2:08:38] appointed singers unto the Lord and that
[2:08:40] should Hal and that should praise the
[2:08:44] beauty of Holiness as they went out
[2:08:47] before the Army and to say praise
[2:08:50] y the Lord for his mercy endureth
[2:08:54] forever now you've got a verse here with
[2:08:56] two Hebrew words going on you've got Hal
[2:08:59] shine
[2:09:01] radiate part of the meaning act
[2:09:07] madly appear
[2:09:09] foolishly and then you've got your doll
[2:09:11] thrust your hands get rid of your burden
[2:09:15] get rid of your
[2:09:16] shackles get rid of your chains and give
[2:09:20] God praise so these singers were going
[2:09:23] to be those who would Inspire the people
[2:09:26] to enter into praise thank God for
[2:09:29] worship
[2:09:31] leaders thank God for anointed worship
[2:09:34] leaders thank God for worship leaders
[2:09:36] that'll
[2:09:41] sweat if you're going to lead worship
[2:09:43] you ought to you ought to work up a
[2:09:46] sweat you ought to put everything you've
[2:09:48] got at
[2:09:50] it you ought to sing loud enough to be
[2:09:53] heard and you ought to have the slight
[2:09:56] look of somebody who knows what they're
[2:09:58] singing
[2:10:02] about leaders leaders worship
[2:10:07] leaders you see we've called them
[2:10:09] because some of us are stuck in the 50s
[2:10:11] and 60s so we call them song
[2:10:15] leaders well anybody can lead a song if
[2:10:17] they can carry a tune in a bucket but
[2:10:20] we're not just trying to encourage
[2:10:22] people to
[2:10:23] sing we're trying to encourage people to
[2:10:26] what praise praise and worship the Lord
[2:10:31] so you've got to get somebody up there
[2:10:33] that will praise and worship the Lord
[2:10:36] not just sing a pretty
[2:10:39] song do you know I stream Services
[2:10:41] sometime where people are praising the
[2:10:43] Lord and leading in praise and worship
[2:10:45] and this and the leader never one time
[2:10:49] never one time raises his hands so he
[2:10:52] really is a song leader from the 50s and
[2:10:53] 60s he's just leading songs he's just
[2:10:56] singing songs and hoping that everybody
[2:10:59] will sing along you need somebody up
[2:11:01] here that'll throw up their hands
[2:11:04] sometime you need somebody up here that
[2:11:07] will Hal a little bit and yah a little
[2:11:10] bit who might shed a tear who might jump
[2:11:13] a little bit there are some more words
[2:11:16] coming because we need somebody to go
[2:11:19] before us into the darkness into the
[2:11:21] heaviness and start breaking open that
[2:11:24] realm that's created anybody listening
[2:11:29] I'm nearly done
[2:11:31] no when people praise Psalm 63:4 thus
[2:11:36] will I bless thee while I live I will
[2:11:42] y I will yadada lift up my hands in thy
[2:11:49] name Psalm 673 3 3 and four let the
[2:11:53] people praise
[2:11:55] y oh God praise thee Oh God let all the
[2:12:00] people praise
[2:12:02] yah thee oh let the Nations be glad and
[2:12:06] sing for Joy for Thou shalt judge the
[2:12:08] people righteously and govern the
[2:12:10] Nations upon the Earth ceaw why are you
[2:12:11] doing this why are you doing this
[2:12:14] brother sh why are you taking time
[2:12:15] tonight to break down all those boring
[2:12:17] and difficult Hebrew words because every
[2:12:19] time you read praise I want you to know
[2:12:22] there's a meaning behind it and the
[2:12:25] Bible has
[2:12:26] prescribed
[2:12:29] yes a
[2:12:30] protocol for praise and that's not
[2:12:33] half-hearted
[2:12:35] praise that's not just following the
[2:12:37] crowd because everybody else is doing it
[2:12:40] that is sincerely with dedication and
[2:12:42] sincerity making up your mind that if
[2:12:45] you're going to praise God Almighty the
[2:12:47] Creator of Heaven and Earth you're going
[2:12:49] to give him everything you've got to
[2:12:50] give him with you're not going to
[2:12:52] whisper your song you're going to sing
[2:12:53] it out even some of you would don't
[2:12:56] carry tune in a
[2:12:58] bucket some of us have to sing three
[2:13:00] times as
[2:13:02] loud to cover you
[2:13:05] up and God still wants to hear your
[2:13:08] voice when I hear that I might say oo
[2:13:11] that was Sour oh that was off key but
[2:13:15] when God hears that he said that's my
[2:13:16] young that's my
[2:13:20] child that's one who's
[2:13:22] determined they're not concerned about
[2:13:25] the the skill they're concerned about me
[2:13:28] they're Lifting me up they're giving me
[2:13:31] something more than just a little bit of
[2:13:33] a a of lip
[2:13:39] service Psalm 1078 I can't read all
[2:13:42] these oh that men would yadah the Lord
[2:13:45] for his goodness and for his wonderful
[2:13:46] works of the Children of Men Psalm 10715

[2:13:52] goodness and for his wonderful works for

[2:13:59] goodness and for his wonderful Works to
[2:14:01] the children of men which means to
[2:14:03] thrust forth the hand as though you were
[2:14:04] throwing something away you are
[2:14:09] Pride

[2:14:16] stuffiness

[2:14:25] yah somebody praise the Lord go ahead

[2:14:42] rejoicing and salvation is in the
[2:14:44] Tabernacles of the
[2:14:46] righteous the right hand of the Lord

[2:15:44] still praising him you and I one day
[2:15:47] will follow on that Journey if we don't
[2:15:50] go by Rapture first but until that day
[2:15:52] we ought to have this attitude I shall
[2:15:54] not die brother Brandon said the bride

[2:16:40] Lord now there's only one way to yah the
[2:16:43] Lord and that's with your
[2:16:46] hands it's what the word means so when
[2:16:49] you're just reading praise you're
[2:16:50] thinking well there's many ways we can
[2:16:52] praise the Lord that's right but there's
[2:16:53] only one way to yadah
[2:16:57] him I don't care how fast they go I'm
[2:17:00] I'm not talking about speed I'm talking
[2:17:03] about getting them up there and I told
[2:17:06] you Tuesday night no preacher should
[2:17:08] ever have to tell you to raise your
[2:17:09] hands no song leader should ever have to
[2:17:11] tell you to raise your hands nobody no
[2:17:14] preacher should ever have to say come on
[2:17:15] folks say Amen you ought to be so
[2:17:18] inspired by the word of God regardless
[2:17:21] of the preacher skill or anointing we
[2:17:23] ought to be so inspired by the word that
[2:17:26] it's like fire shut up in our bones and
[2:17:28] when we hear the
[2:17:31] truth
[2:17:33] you amen there's one good way to stay
[2:17:35] awake let me give you the remedy for
[2:17:37] sleeping in church Praise Him
[2:17:41] participate help the preacher Lord knows
[2:17:44] he needs help open to me the gates of
[2:17:47] righteousness I will go into them and I
[2:17:48] will yadah the Lord this gate of the
[2:17:51] Lord into which the righteous shall
[2:17:52] enter I will yadah thee for thou Hast
[2:17:56] heard me and art become my
[2:18:01] Yeshua my salvation the next one we just
[2:18:05] covered recently for Thanksgiving it's
[2:18:08] toada write it down
[2:18:12] toada it appears 32 times in the in the
[2:18:16] Bible and it means
[2:18:18] confession toada literally means an
[2:18:22] extension of the hand in
[2:18:25] adoration an
[2:18:28] avow an open statement of affirmation
[2:18:32] Frank acknowledgment or admission or
[2:18:37] acceptance It's
[2:18:39] serious toah comes from the same root
[2:18:41] word as yada but is used more
[2:18:46] specifically to da as you know is the
[2:18:49] modern Hebrew word for what thank
[2:18:53] you you want to say thank you in Hebrew
[2:18:55] you say toada if you want to say thank
[2:18:58] you very much you say toar Raba and you
[2:19:01] don't answer like you would think to
[2:19:03] answer you're welcome remember you
[2:19:05] answer please like in other European
[2:19:07] cultures and please in Hebrew is is
[2:19:11] what Raba and you answer
[2:19:14] bakas bakas which means I I I'm pleased
[2:19:19] to offer thanks toada comes from that
[2:19:23] same principle word but is used more
[2:19:26] specifically as an extension of the hand
[2:19:29] in
[2:19:30] adoration by way of application it is
[2:19:33] apparent in the Psalms and elsewhere
[2:19:36] that it is used for thanking God for
[2:19:39] things not
[2:19:43] yet received do you remember that it's
[2:19:47] transl ated sometimes as praise other
[2:19:49] times it's translated as
[2:19:51] Thanksgiving and it is a word that is
[2:19:54] reserved for the kind of thanks that
[2:19:57] says I thank you because you have been
[2:19:59] faithful yesterday I thank you because
[2:20:02] you are faithful today and I thank you
[2:20:04] because you will be faithful tomorrow is
[2:20:07] anybody confident of that are you sure
[2:20:11] that he's going to be I
[2:20:14] am toai is a praised filled confession
[2:20:18] that God's word is infallible and that
[2:20:20] it is working in your
[2:20:23] circumstances I want to tell you
[2:20:25] something God's word is
[2:20:29] infallible it cannot
[2:20:31] fail pastors are not
[2:20:36] infallible churches are not
[2:20:39] infallible prophets are not
[2:20:42] infallible tapes are not
[2:20:45] infallible but God's word is in
[2:20:47] infallible it cannot fail it cannot it
[2:20:51] cannot it cannot fail it is infallible I
[2:20:55] want you to look at Psalms 42 1-5 as the
[2:20:58] heart remember that's a little deer as
[2:21:00] the heart panteth after the water Brooks
[2:21:02] so panteth my soul after thee Oh God my

[2:25:02] the sacrifice of praise into the house
[2:25:05] of the Lord for I will cause to return
[2:25:08] the Captivity of the land oh my as at
[2:25:12] the first sayith the Lord do you know
[2:25:13] what that means I will restore the
[2:25:15] prisoners I will bring the hostages home
[2:25:17] I will bring the prisoners back hello
[2:25:20] you got loved ones that Satan took
[2:25:23] off have you got friends that Satan drug
[2:25:28] away you know I keep hearing this
[2:25:31] phrase so and so left the
[2:25:34] message so and so left I I I don't know
[2:25:37] what that
[2:25:39] means I I don't even know how it's
[2:25:42] possible if it means you no longer
[2:25:45] fellowship with people who Fellowship
[2:25:47] around the ministry of brother brandham
[2:25:49] I get
[2:25:50] it but the message was never William
[2:25:55] brandham it was never him he tells us
[2:25:59] that the message was the revelation of
[2:26:02] Jesus Christ how do you change churches
[2:26:06] and leave the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:26:09] that's true and then I hear other people
[2:26:11] saying things like well they're just
[2:26:13] shook well I want you to know maybe some
[2:26:14] of them are I would you know maybe some
[2:26:17] of them are shook maybe some of them
[2:26:19] were not seed in the beginning maybe
[2:26:21] some of them were never bride but I just
[2:26:23] can't
[2:26:24] accept that every person who stumbles
[2:26:26] out from Among Us that's I I just can't
[2:26:29] believe they're all of the
[2:26:32] devil you you may find that easy to
[2:26:34] believe but I just can't believe that
[2:26:36] they're all of the devil I want you to
[2:26:38] know we've all been through some tough
[2:26:40] times we we've all had some
[2:26:42] disillusionments in our life we've all
[2:26:44] had questions arise we've all had doubts
[2:26:47] arise it drove some of us out of the
[2:26:49] Fellowship of the faith but that doesn't
[2:26:51] mean that God doesn't know where to get
[2:26:54] us it doesn't mean that he don't know
[2:26:56] how to find us in Satan's captivity I'm
[2:26:59] not just going to say because they left
[2:27:01] a message Church they've left Jesus
[2:27:03] Christ I'm going to believe that some of
[2:27:06] them are being held captive in the hands
[2:27:08] of the enemy and when a little bride
[2:27:10] begins to get stirred
[2:27:12] up and we get filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:27:16] and fire the fullness of God in our
[2:27:20] midst I'm going to believe that that God
[2:27:23] knows how to go get them and bring them
[2:27:25] out of captivity for I will cause to
[2:27:27] return the Captivity of the land and at
[2:27:31] the first as the first sayeth the Lord
[2:27:34] number four I'm not getting to all of
[2:27:37] them but I'm going to get this one in
[2:27:39] number four is Barack
[2:27:42] Barak it means
[2:27:44] blessing baruk is bless or blessing
[2:27:49] Barack is a significant word that
[2:27:51] appears
[2:27:52] 330 times in the Old Testament are you
[2:27:55] give out
[2:27:56] yet however this word is only translated
[2:27:58] to praise once in English and even then
[2:28:01] only in the King James version or the
[2:28:03] new King James it means to bless it
[2:28:06] means to give thanks and praises to God
[2:28:08] because he has given to us out of his
[2:28:10] abundance to bless is an act of of
[2:28:12] adoration and it means specifically to
[2:28:15] kneel to kneel
[2:28:18] down to bless God as an act of adoration
[2:28:22] to salute now I I'm not I'm not calling
[2:28:24] anyone
[2:28:26] out but I noticed that when we were up
[2:28:29] here praising the Lord I won't even say
[2:28:30] the name but one of our brothers he
[2:28:33] knelt down here and he began to to
[2:28:35] Worship the Lord I'm not even going to
[2:28:38] tell you that it was in
[2:28:39] tongues but it
[2:28:44] was and had it been a message
[2:28:47] had it captured all of our attention it
[2:28:50] would have required an
[2:28:52] interpretation but it didn't and I'm
[2:28:55] going to tell you something if you try
[2:28:56] to make that Prophet say something more
[2:28:58] than what Paul
[2:29:00] [Music]
[2:29:02] said sir he said don't you do that to me
[2:29:06] he said I can't preach anything other
[2:29:08] than what Paul
[2:29:10] preached I think a lot of people have
[2:29:12] forgotten how he described the ministry
[2:29:14] of the seventh angel I I don't want to
[2:29:15] get in this heavy I know so of you
[2:29:16] aren't with us in
[2:29:18] that but I like how he described it he
[2:29:20] said in fact that that that minister of
[2:29:22] the seventh angel that Ministry of the
[2:29:24] seventh angel he has no message that
[2:29:26] messenger he has no message of his
[2:29:30] own I know what you've read in the
[2:29:32] church age book but I know what he said
[2:29:35] sir he said he has no message of his own
[2:29:38] it's his job to tie
[2:29:41] together all the lucans so all you
[2:29:44] people that get so carried away with
[2:29:46] reading between the lines and telling me
[2:29:48] that brother brandom said that to throw
[2:29:50] us off and all kinds of crazy things
[2:29:51] that people have come up with through
[2:29:52] the years why don't you just let this
[2:29:54] message be based on the absolute why
[2:29:57] don't you just let it fit the word why
[2:29:59] don't you just let it dovetail with the
[2:30:02] Bible and if it don't we don't know how
[2:30:04] to Pro we do not know how to handle it
[2:30:06] if it doesn't it's not up to you to
[2:30:09] figure it
[2:30:13] out it's our it's our place to trust God
[2:30:17] stay on the word stay in the word don't
[2:30:20] don't make him say something more than
[2:30:25] Paul somebody said what about church
[2:30:27] order well let me tell you this he also
[2:30:29] said in more than one place that the
[2:30:31] pastor is the highest Spiritual
[2:30:34] Authority in the
[2:30:35] church he said our churches are
[2:30:39] sovereign you know what that means
[2:30:41] Sovereign it means we're not depending
[2:30:43] on one another for how to do we're not
[2:30:47] asking our sister churches for money
[2:30:49] they're not asking us for money we're
[2:30:51] not trying to make them worship like
[2:30:54] us I'm GNA stop with
[2:30:57] that because sometimes I feel pressured
[2:31:00] to worship as they
[2:31:02] do but I'm not going
[2:31:06] to but don't you know there's to be
[2:31:08] three

[2:31:28] leave I don't lock the
[2:31:30] doors you can leave when you need to
[2:31:32] leave but I tell you what you're not

[2:31:44] rush

[2:32:13] good so I can see it when I'm preaching
[2:32:16] uh I might have added a few things after
[2:32:18] that but at the time that she asked me I
[2:32:21] was formatting and as she walks down the
[2:32:22] hall she said uh if you keep on study

[2:32:57] ever get a Dr
[2:32:59] Pepper what I am going to do when I
[2:33:01] leave here is know that I have
[2:33:07] delivered you see I didn't sit up here
[2:33:09] and rest while you
[2:33:12] praised not going to do that folks I
[2:33:15] needed as much as you do I'm going to
[2:33:17] enter in Hallelujah I have to I'm not
[2:33:20] bragging on no no no no no I'm rotten
[2:33:23] esar I'm rotting in every
[2:33:26] way there's nothing good in me except
[2:33:29] him but I tell you when I get in this
[2:33:31] presence I cannot lock myself in a room
[2:33:36] I've got to come out here and praise
[2:33:38] because you're
[2:33:40] praising and the atmosphere that you
[2:33:43] create makes me want to get in the
[2:33:44] middle of it I want to be a part of of
[2:33:46] it I want to be part of it now this
[2:33:47] Barack means to bow down to kneel down
[2:33:51] it means to come in as a salute or an
[2:33:53] act of adoration it's usually used in a
[2:33:56] time of prayer or meditation but it's a
[2:33:59] form of Praise that means a humble
[2:34:02] position before
[2:34:03] God so I saw our brother kneel down
[2:34:07] there and and I don't think there was
[2:34:09] anybody here but maybe there was some
[2:34:11] that said that that saw that and thought
[2:34:13] Oh what is he doing there there comes a
[2:34:16] time it wasn't an altar call but there
[2:34:20] Comes A Time you just want to get
[2:34:23] low brother I've been in that Holy
[2:34:26] presence where I wanted to put my face
[2:34:27] under the
[2:34:28] carpet I didn't want to lay my head on
[2:34:31] the on the carpet I want to get under
[2:34:32] the
[2:34:33] floorboards there's something about his
[2:34:35] Holiness his awesomeness his
[2:34:38] righteousness oh the Majesty of the key
[2:34:41] and you just want to bless you just want
[2:34:42] to bow now if you're not physically able
[2:34:44] to Bow this is not not only talking
[2:34:46] about a position of the body I can't be
[2:34:49] on my knees for an extremely long amount
[2:34:51] of time without a cushion or something
[2:34:53] like that but it's not just about the
[2:34:55] physical Barack it's not just about the
[2:34:57] physical bowing it's bowing low it's
[2:35:01] getting your emotions bowed down it's
[2:35:03] getting your mind and your will bowed
[2:35:05] down and surrendered and submitted to
[2:35:07] him it's approaching him in a lowly
[2:35:09] place instead of instead of an exalted
[2:35:12] Place how many of you think you
[2:35:14] understand the word Barack and in 1st
[2:35:16] Chronicles 29:20 hurry we're nearly done
[2:35:19] it's 8:30 yes I
[2:35:22] know 1 Chronicles 29:20 and David said
[2:35:25] to all the congregation now bless the
[2:35:27] Lord Barack
[2:35:29] bless
[2:35:31] Barack bow before the Lord your God and
[2:35:34] all the congregation bless the Lord God
[2:35:37] of their fathers there it is again
[2:35:39] Barack the Lord God of their fathers and
[2:35:42] bowed down their heads and worshiped the
[2:35:44] Lord and the King Psalm 31:21 blessed
[2:35:49] Barack be the Lord for he hath showed me
[2:35:51] his marvelous kindness in a strong City
[2:35:54] Psalm 34:1 I Will Bless Barack the Lord
[2:35:57] at all
[2:35:58] times I will bow before the Lord my
[2:36:01] maker at all times his praise shall
[2:36:04] continually do do you think you're over
[2:36:06] focusing praise I do
[2:36:09] not I do not think it's being
[2:36:11] overemphasized in this hour I think
[2:36:14] we're busting out amen of years of molds
[2:36:17] and boxes
[2:36:20] and I think we're learning what it's
[2:36:22] like to be
[2:36:23] free his praise shall continually be in
[2:36:25] my mouth Psalm 63:4 thus will I bless
[2:36:28] Barack thee while I live I will lift up
[2:36:31] my hands in thy name Psalm 7215 and he
[2:36:33] shall live and to him shall be given of
[2:36:35] the gold of Sheba prayer also shall be
[2:36:38] made for him continually and daily shall
[2:36:40] he be praised Barack that's the one time
[2:36:44] it's translated praise Psalm 956 oh come
[2:36:47] let us worship and bow down let us kneel
[2:36:49] Barack before the Lord our maker one
[2:36:52] more Psalm 1031 and two bless Barack the
[2:36:55] Lord oh my soul and all that is within
[2:37:00] me bless His holy
[2:37:03] name bless Barack the Lord oh my soul
[2:37:08] and forget not all his benefits number
[2:37:11] five zamar it's sometimes pronounced in
[2:37:14] Hebrew zamar
[2:37:16] used 45 times in the Bible It's A
[2:37:19] Primitive root word through the idea of
[2:37:21] striking with the
[2:37:22] fingers properly to touch the strings or
[2:37:25] parts of a musical instruments play upon
[2:37:27] it to make music sometimes accompanied
[2:37:30] by The Voice hence to celebrate in song
[2:37:33] and music to give praise to sing forth
[2:37:35] Praises zamar uh uh means to pluck the
[2:37:39] strings of an instrument to sing along
[2:37:41] to praise it's a musical word which is
[2:37:44] largely involved with joy joyful
[2:37:46] expressions of music with musical
[2:37:48] instruments to celebrate with
[2:37:50] instruments to praise the Lord
[2:37:52] skillfully on an instrument to touch
[2:37:53] strings with the fingers when David
[2:37:56] established the Tabernacle in Zion he
[2:37:59] set singers before the Lord and
[2:38:01] commanded them to continuously praise
[2:38:03] zamar him to continually play on strings
[2:38:08] a that would accompany their voices as
[2:38:10] they worshiped him now I know that the
[2:38:13] the Church of Christ and other other
[2:38:15] groups believe that musical instruments
[2:38:17] should not be played in church because
[2:38:18] they're not mentioned in the New
[2:38:20] Testament I need you to understand once
[2:38:23] again that there's a reason for them not
[2:38:25] being mentioned in the New Testament and
[2:38:26] that is simply it was the common
[2:38:28] practice of worship yes every group that
[2:38:32] got together sung they brought these
[2:38:34] instruments with them even into the
[2:38:35] synagogues of Judea and the surrounding
[2:38:38] areas they sang they played on the
[2:38:40] instruments what we would call guitars
[2:38:42] today or Harps and they worship so no no
[2:38:45] one had to say don't forget to bring
[2:38:47] your guitar don't forget to bring it
[2:38:49] didn't have to be mentioned in the New
[2:38:51] Testament because it was something that
[2:38:53] everyone knew was already established in
[2:38:56] the Bible as a part of
[2:39:01] worship
[2:39:04] Zar
[2:39:09] Zar the fingers
[2:39:13] zamar and it goes through the scripture
[2:39:15] and I don't want to take the time but
[2:39:17] 1st Chronicles 16810 give thanks unto
[2:39:19] the Lord call upon his name make known
[2:39:21] his deeds among the People Sing unto him
[2:39:23] sing
[2:39:25] Psalms the word Psalms here is the words
[2:39:28] themar unto him talk ye of all his
[2:39:30] wondrous Works Glory ye in His holy name
[2:39:32] let the heart of them Rejoice that seek
[2:39:34] the Lord Psalm 21:13 be thou exalted oh
[2:39:37] Lord in thine own strength so will we
[2:39:39] sing and praise Zar thy power Psalm
[2:39:44] 33:20 excuse me 332 praise the Lord with
[2:39:47] harp sing zamar unto him with saltry and
[2:39:51] an instrument of 10 strings now it there
[2:39:55] there are some people who say there were
[2:39:56] no instruments of 10 strings in the Old
[2:39:59] Testament there are those who say there
[2:40:00] were instrument instruments of of nine
[2:40:03] and 11 and 12 and sometimes 10 but
[2:40:06] here's what I like to say if you don't

[3:01:41] free Hallelujah
[3:01:45] you ask look look this is what has
[3:01:48] brought us together the way we are
[3:01:50] tonight that's why we're
[3:01:52] here we are those who know what it means
[3:01:56] to be
[3:01:58] bound not just in
[3:02:00] sin that was way back there for some of
[3:02:03] us but we know what it means to be in
[3:02:05] the clutches of
[3:02:09] religion there's people here that know
[3:02:11] what it means to to have to make sure
[3:02:13] sure you've got the right kind of window
[3:02:16] shade
[3:02:19] yes most of the New Hope folks You' have
[3:02:22] never lasted
[3:02:28] there you you not even a
[3:02:31] button because that was
[3:02:34] prideful man's ideas they'll just
[3:02:37] they'll weigh you down with all kinds of
[3:02:40] regulations and rules to try to bind you
[3:02:42] and keep you you they don't want you to
[3:02:45] go
[3:02:48] anywhere we got SE some of us got
[3:02:50] separated from our mothers at Birth and
[3:02:53] we spent some time in the barnyard of
[3:02:57] denominationalism and we grew among the
[3:03:00] chickens Hallelujah we knew we didn't
[3:03:03] look like them we didn't act like them
[3:03:04] and we didn't even like to eat what they
[3:03:06] ate but all we could do was eat what we
[3:03:10] had and then one
[3:03:12] day Jehovah
[3:03:16] Eagle Jehovah
[3:03:18] Eagle he comes flying over that Barnard
[3:03:22] with
[3:03:24] a and when we heard it we recognized who
[3:03:28] we
[3:03:29] were and we knew we didn't belong to the
[3:03:32] chickens we didn't Belong To The
[3:03:35] Barnyard we weren't called to Peck
[3:03:37] around in the yard we were called to
[3:03:40] take up our wings Hallelujah and
[3:03:44] sore through the revelation of his word
[3:03:48] and through
[3:03:50] freedom but slowly many of us slowly
[3:03:54] allowed
[3:03:56] men to tame
[3:03:58] us we said we'd never do it again but
[3:04:02] even around this great truth many of us
[3:04:05] got tamed
[3:04:07] again that's finished that's done away
[3:04:10] with that's not for today and the next
[3:04:13] thing you know that Spirit has so
[3:04:14] morphed
[3:04:16] itself until now it's no longer just no
[3:04:19] gifts and no freedom to worship and no
[3:04:21] emotion involved now it's no
[3:04:25] preachers come on it's the same
[3:04:28] devil it's just morphed itself in De
[3:04:30] press play and Obey you see the enemy
[3:04:34] wasn't satisfied just taking the gifts
[3:04:35] of the Spirit he wasn't satisfied just
[3:04:38] taking tongues and interpretation and
[3:04:40] prophecy and healing he wanted the
[3:04:42] five-fold ministry he wanted to
[3:04:44] steal he wanted to steal the five-fold
[3:04:47] ministry from the bride of Christ yes
[3:04:50] and make her believe her only hope was
[3:04:53] to
[3:04:54] gather preacher sit down and press play
[3:04:56] and Obey listen I love those tapes I
[3:04:59] listen to the message every day or or
[3:05:01] every other day of my life because it's
[3:05:04] food for
[3:05:06] me but I know God has a five-fold
[3:05:08] Ministry in the earth amen I hear the
[3:05:11] prophet telling us that she would that
[3:05:13] five-fold Ministry would be on the scene
[3:05:15] for the perfecting of the bride and we
[3:05:18] need it but they didn't take the
[3:05:21] five-fold ministry away first they just
[3:05:23] started at the apostles and Prophets
[3:05:26] yeah right for years it was okay to be a
[3:05:29] pastor a teacher or an evangelist but
[3:05:31] not to be a five-fold prophet or a
[3:05:33] five-fold apostle and now now look what
[3:05:35] the spirit's done they say the fivefold
[3:05:38] ministry is over with and all we can do
[3:05:40] is listen to tapes come on now on some
[3:05:44] of us you've just come too
[3:05:46] late you've just come too late to tell
[3:05:48] us because we've had once you get a
[3:05:51] taste of freedom I don't mean freedom to
[3:05:55] sin I mean freedom to
[3:05:58] soar there's nothing out there in the
[3:06:00] world I want but I want everything that
[3:06:02] the Holy Ghost has for
[3:06:05] me now one last thing in closing and
[3:06:08] that is
[3:06:09] this the spirit of God doesn't have to
[3:06:12] move on you
[3:06:13] to raise your
[3:06:16] hands that's not what praise
[3:06:18] is praise is not always a response to
[3:06:21] the
[3:06:22] moment praise is sometimes a a
[3:06:25] Thanksgiving offering a sacrifice of
[3:06:27] praise so if you're sitting in a service
[3:06:30] and you don't feel like rais you raise
[3:06:31] them
[3:06:32] anyway and this whole idea that nobody
[3:06:35] can dance or jump or move around unless
[3:06:37] the Holy Ghost gets on them that's just
[3:06:39] not what I see in the in the Book of
[3:06:41] Psalms it say it doesn't say say wait on
[3:06:43] the spirit wait on you wait on the Holy
[3:06:45] Ghost to come take over run you out of
[3:06:47] your own thinking capacity he didn't say
[3:06:49] that said praise the Lord in the dance
[3:06:52] praise the Lord clap your hands he said
[3:06:54] shout unto God you don't have to wait on
[3:06:57] an inspiration to do what the Bible has
[3:06:59] told you to
[3:07:03] do sometimes it's a sacrifice how many
[3:07:06] there's only two times to praise the
[3:07:07] Lord right when you feel like
[3:07:12] it when you don't you're a marvelous
[3:07:15] group of
[3:07:17] people all of
[3:07:19] you I I I don't want to be weird here
[3:07:23] strange but I believe every one of you
[3:07:25] were supposed to be here
[3:07:27] tonight you have added something to this
[3:07:30] service you've brought something with
[3:07:33] you you didn't just come here to get you

[3:07:38] strength here and you're ministering to
