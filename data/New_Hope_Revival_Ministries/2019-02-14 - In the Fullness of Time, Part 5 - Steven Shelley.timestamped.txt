[0:02] [Music]
[0:09] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right Weist
[0:43] in you the hope award
[0:45] [Music]
[0:59] hello there I'm Pastor Steven Shelley
[1:02] and it's my joy to be able to come to
[1:05] you again in partnership with the gospel
[1:08] channel and speak to you from my heart
[1:11] from God's Word and hopefully share
[1:15] something that would be an inspiration
[1:16] and a blessing to you in your life we've
[1:19] been coming to you on a weekly basis for
[1:22] almost a year now with this hour-long
[1:25] broadcast and we just feel so very
[1:28] blessed to be able to serve you with the
[1:32] word of truth and also to be partners
[1:35] with the gospel channel help provide
[1:37] some programming that might be of help
[1:40] to you and we hope in the near future to
[1:43] be able to produce our 30-minute program
[1:46] again the Eagles cry so many of you
[1:49] still mention that and what a blessing
[1:51] it was to you and it's certainly in our
[1:55] hearts to bring that format back to you
[1:58] as well but we just we're just really
[2:00] thankful that God has given us this
[2:03] opportunity and the one-hour format I
[2:06] realize that perhaps it gets a little
[2:08] long for you sometime but it does give
[2:11] us the opportunity to go a little bit
[2:13] deeper into study and to lay the
[2:16] foundation and then build on that from
[2:19] week to week so I pray that you will
[2:21] bear with us in the length of the
[2:24] program that you'll stick with us we
[2:27] still get questions about hey I missed I
[2:30] missed episode three or I I missed the
[2:33] first episode of a particular series and
[2:36] what do I do about that
[2:37] well on occasion we have people who want
[2:40] to order it on a DVD and we can make
[2:43] that available on a limited basis we
[2:46] certainly can do that but the easiest
[2:48] way to catch up on any episode in a
[2:51] series that you've missed is to go to
[2:54] our youtube channel because on our
[2:56] youtube channel you will find all of the
[3:00] programs that we have produced in
[3:02] partnership with the gospel channel I
[3:05] think you'll see some of the Eagles cry
[3:07] brought
[3:08] ask that we have done for so many years
[3:10] and I'm real excited about a new
[3:13] outreach that the staff is putting
[3:15] together called new hope moments and
[3:17] you'll be able to see those we call them
[3:20] just little bite-size nuggets of
[3:23] inspiration and they are taken from our
[3:26] lives services here at New Hope revival
[3:29] Center in Smith Station Alabama and I
[3:32] feel like that you would be blessed if
[3:35] you visit our YouTube channel and if you
[3:39] go up and press the subscribe button
[3:41] then you will be notified by email when
[3:45] new content is added YouTube does that
[3:48] automatically and let you know that we
[3:50] have added a new video whether it's a
[3:54] gospel channel broadcast or the new hope
[3:57] moments or music sometimes we put on
[4:01] songs from our services whatever the
[4:04] content is you'll be notified
[4:06] I'd really like to tell you about
[4:08] something that I'm very very excited
[4:12] about and may take me a minute or two to
[4:14] do it many many years ago when God began
[4:20] to stir our hearts for what the future
[4:23] would look like this was you know around
[4:27] 1990 perhaps 1991 I had already been in
[4:33] the ministry for a long time I think
[4:35] some of you know my testimony I received
[4:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost when I was
[4:40] seven years old and as incredible and
[4:44] outlandish as it sounds I started into
[4:47] public ministry shortly thereafter and
[4:50] had a traveling ministry from the age of
[4:54] seven on preaching the gospel praying
[4:58] for the sick and not just to children or
[5:01] to young people sometimes I would be
[5:04] invited to come and do a special revival
[5:07] for young people or for children in
[5:09] particular but the the main part of our
[5:12] ministry for so many years was in a
[5:15] revival type set
[5:17] and we would be invited to go in for
[5:19] revivals and sometimes they would let be
[5:22] scheduled for three days and last three
[5:24] weeks and sometimes even longer than
[5:27] that and those were wonderful days in
[5:30] 1988-89
[5:32] I had some powerful encounters with the
[5:36] Lord and I tried to be obedient to the
[5:40] leadership of the Holy Spirit and he led
[5:43] me to some truths that radically changed
[5:47] my life
[5:48] satisfied me in the word in a way that I
[5:51] had never been satisfied before and it
[5:55] became my desire then to to use the
[5:58] gifts and the talents that God had
[6:00] placed in my life in the calling that he
[6:02] had placed on my life and and used that
[6:05] ministry and my gifts to help bring
[6:09] people to the same truth that so changed
[6:13] my life and I often refer to it as the
[6:15] revelation of Jesus Christ because it is
[6:18] such an unveiling in the word and once
[6:23] you know once it becomes a part of who
[6:25] you are it really changes you forever
[6:27] and so what really happened in in 1990
[6:31] the Lord brought me home back to the
[6:34] city of my birth Columbus Georgia and I
[6:38] ended up my grandmother what had been a
[6:41] minister for many years she had stepped
[6:43] aside from her role and not too long
[6:47] after that the Lord took her home and
[6:50] she was such a very godly and powerful
[6:53] influence in my life she had shared so
[6:56] much truth with me and I rejoice that
[6:59] the Lord then toward the end of her life
[7:03] gave me the same opportunity to share
[7:06] truth with her that that really deeply
[7:11] impacted her life at times when we would
[7:14] study or we would listen to sermons
[7:16] together she would say you know I've
[7:19] been waiting on this truth I've been
[7:21] waiting on this understanding this
[7:23] revelation and so in 1990 I left the
[7:28] church that I was pastoring in another
[7:30] came home to Columbus Georgia and I
[7:33] began to pasture the home church and I
[7:36] wished I could tell you that that
[7:37] everything was smooth as glass but as
[7:41] often is the case in church work we we
[7:44] hit some pretty big bumps in the road
[7:46] and I obviously had a different style of
[7:52] presenting truth and pastoring then my
[7:55] grandmother had years before and so
[7:59] there were struggles but toward the end
[8:02] of 90 and into 91 God began to send
[8:06] people to me that that you know he just
[8:09] brought them alongside of me and they
[8:12] were excited about what God was doing in
[8:15] our little Church in Columbus and they
[8:18] wanted to be a part of reaching out of
[8:21] taking it a little bit beyond the four
[8:24] walls of the church
[8:25] and so we had some precious friends who
[8:29] were living in Canada in Alberta Canada
[8:32] some of them actually made a move to
[8:34] come to Georgia to come to Alabama and
[8:38] to help us in the outreach and others
[8:41] remain there in in Edmonton Alberta
[8:44] Canada and God used them also to help us
[8:48] in amazing ways my testimony was printed
[8:52] in a book that was entitled write the
[8:55] vision and that testimony book was sent
[8:58] out free of charge to pastors and
[9:00] ministers all over the world and as soon
[9:02] as that book got out there were many
[9:05] invitations that begin to come in and
[9:08] the ministry expanded rapidly over the
[9:13] course of the next few years all of that
[9:15] testimony by the way I've never shared
[9:18] any of that with you here on these
[9:20] broadcasts so you're getting something
[9:22] out of me that I didn't come in here
[9:24] prepared to share but around 1991 we
[9:31] knew that God was really going to open
[9:35] doors that that at the time we didn't
[9:37] even know what the doors would look like
[9:39] let me give you an example there were
[9:41] already little groups of believers of
[9:44] precious friends all over the world who
[9:48] had felt connected in the spirit and I
[9:52] know some of you will understand that I
[9:54] mean some of them were people we had
[9:56] never met face to face but they felt
[9:58] connected with the message that we were
[10:01] bringing and we were excited about it
[10:03] and they also were excited and so they
[10:07] wanted to share our services well in
[10:11] 1991-92 the internet wasn't was nothing
[10:16] to be heard of much at all and we we
[10:20] knew that there was an old technology
[10:22] that dated back to the 60s that people
[10:27] would use called a telephone hookup
[10:29] where you would call and basically you
[10:32] would be placed on hold like if you
[10:35] called the doctor's office and while you
[10:37] were placed on hold
[10:38] then whatever sound was coming into that
[10:41] system you would hear it on your on your
[10:43] telephone on the handset of your
[10:46] telephone and so people began to write
[10:49] and call and they said we want to be on
[10:50] the telephone hookup so we had a maybe
[10:54] one or two lines in the beginning and we
[10:56] ended up with a dozen or more telephone
[10:58] lines in our little church and people
[11:01] would call in and we would write their
[11:04] name or their city record where they
[11:06] were from and we would flip that switch
[11:08] and they would share the services with
[11:10] us and obviously I don't have time to
[11:12] share with you the testimonies but there
[11:16] were hundreds of testimonies that came
[11:18] in in those days of people being so
[11:21] blessed and so strengthened especially
[11:23] those who had no church in their area
[11:26] that they could feel connected to but
[11:28] God began to speak to us about a time
[11:30] that that there would be other
[11:32] technology available and I remember you
[11:36] know boldly declaring that there will
[11:38] come a time that not only will we be
[11:41] able to allow people to hear our
[11:44] services live but they will also see
[11:47] them and of course there were many of us
[11:49] younger people that said yeah
[11:51] that I know that's gonna be but there
[11:54] were some who said no way no way I mean
[11:57] that you know that's just not going to
[11:59] be but as you know technology has
[12:04] continued to roll on and now we have
[12:07] people streaming our services both audio
[12:09] and video all over the world we
[12:12] registered our domain on the World Wide
[12:15] Web back in those days revival dot o-r-g
[12:19] and had we known what then what we know
[12:24] now we would have got all the revival
[12:26] domains but we got revival org and we
[12:31] put up as soon as as soon as we could we
[12:34] begin to put up websites and we began to
[12:37] share but I remember one day in our
[12:40] offices in Columbus Georgia computers
[12:43] were really dull in in the late 80s and
[12:46] early 90s we're not talking about
[12:48] backlit screens and fancy screen savers
[12:52] and and and something that looks nice to
[12:55] the eye you know basically I was looking
[12:57] at a blank screen with a little green
[12:59] hue to it and but some of the folks who
[13:03] were working with us in Canada had had
[13:06] downloaded a software that would let us
[13:09] chat with one another now I know that
[13:13] most of you cannot imagine that because
[13:15] we text on our phones and we can talk to
[13:19] the world but in those days that was not
[13:21] happening and it certainly wasn't
[13:23] happening in church work and so I
[13:25] remember standing there one day when a
[13:27] brother from our who partnered with us
[13:30] in Canada he sent a message and I
[13:34] watched this little flashing cursor move
[13:36] across the screen h-e-l-l-o hello and
[13:42] hello brother Shelly and you know
[13:46] literally I jumped up and down I said
[13:50] this is the most amazing thing I can
[13:52] communicate with my brother we were
[13:54] working on the testimony book and we're
[13:56] working on other outreaches and and
[13:58] letters were coming in that we needed to
[14:00] know how to answer and and here is a way
[14:03] that we could communicate without making
[14:05] a
[14:05] call and so in those days the Lord began
[14:09] to let us know that there would be there
[14:11] would be technology and there would be
[14:13] outreaches and we have seen God so
[14:16] faithfully do every bit of that we are
[14:18] connected with Saints literally in
[14:21] almost every nation of the world but
[14:23] recently we have launched an app for
[14:28] your smartphone and it's it's already
[14:32] getting a lot of good feedback and the
[14:35] reason why I went all the way back
[14:37] through all that history that might be a
[14:39] little boring for you is when I got the
[14:42] word that we were about to go live with
[14:45] that
[14:45] with that app and I and I looked at all
[14:48] the hard work that our staff had put
[14:50] into making that possible how easy it is
[14:53] to access everything I jumped up and
[14:56] down again I cried a little I laughed a
[14:59] little I praised God a little and it so
[15:02] reminded me of that excitement that I
[15:05] had almost 30 years ago when those
[15:07] little little that little cursor moved
[15:10] across the screen and I said this is
[15:12] revolutionary well I believe our app is
[15:15] revolutionary and I just want to mention
[15:18] it to you and I want you to know that
[15:20] you can visit your App Store you can
[15:23] search for New Hope revival ministries
[15:26] you can find the app it is absolutely
[15:29] 100% free of charge you can download
[15:33] that onto your phone or your or your
[15:36] device that you used to connect and you
[15:41] can have access to a lot of our material
[15:45] and I'm telling you we're going to be
[15:47] adding to it on a very regular basis
[15:50] it's going to be a wonderful blessing in
[15:53] your life I know and just remember that
[15:56] you can search all of the various app
[15:58] stores the Apple Store and whatever you
[16:02] use for your Android device it's there
[16:05] and Roku it's there Apple TV it's there
[16:10] and there may be even a few other
[16:12] formats that are available that will let
[16:15] you know at a future time we're just
[16:17] really learning about it even now every
[16:21] day I get a little more excited about it
[16:24] you will find sermons from our ministry
[16:27] but you will also find sermons from the
[16:31] Ministry of brother William Branham
[16:33] which I know will be a blessing to you
[16:37] it was his ministry that so changed the
[16:41] direction of my life and answered so
[16:44] many hundreds and thousands of questions
[16:47] that I had had since I started studying
[16:49] the Bible as a seven-year-old boy and
[16:53] you know I recognize that everybody
[16:55] doesn't look at it the same way that I
[16:58] do but you will have availability you
[17:01] will be able to hear the sermons there's
[17:04] video content there's audio content and
[17:07] then there was a precious friend and
[17:10] mentor of mine whose name was brother
[17:13] Perry green and originally from Beaumont
[17:18] Texas he wasn't born there but but
[17:22] that's where he ended up in business and
[17:25] in ministry so many years ago and he was
[17:29] connected to the ministry of brother
[17:31] Branham and he had so many phenomenal
[17:34] experiences in the meetings he saw so
[17:38] many profound miracles and his life was
[17:42] such a blessing and such an
[17:43] encouragement to mine he went home to be
[17:46] with the Lord now going on for years and
[17:49] I had the precious honor and privilege
[17:52] of preaching his memorial service when
[17:55] he went home to be with the Lord and
[17:57] there are other ways that you can access
[18:01] some of the sermons of brother Branham
[18:03] on the on the Internet there are ways
[18:05] that you can also access some of the
[18:08] sermons of brother green but we wanted
[18:11] to take what we consider the best of the
[18:14] best and share it with you on our app so
[18:17] what that means is whether it's New Hope
[18:20] revival ministries
[18:22] the teaching and preaching that I do
[18:23] whether it's the Ministry of brother
[18:26] branham his teaching and preaching or
[18:28] even brother Perry green it will all be
[18:31] there on your smartphone on your iPad on
[18:35] your Android device even on your Apple
[18:38] TV or your Roku so you would be able to
[18:41] stream the content live and you know
[18:43] what I use it every day the thought
[18:47] crossed my mind I wonder if that's just
[18:48] because it's exciting and it's new but
[18:51] you know I think that the reality is no
[18:53] it's the convenience it's the
[18:56] convenience of having it in my hand I
[18:58] had a text this morning from a sister in
[19:01] our church she's been with us for quite
[19:03] a few years now she's a tremendous
[19:05] blessing and our local congregation she
[19:08] has a computer she has access to the
[19:10] Internet and has for years but she said
[19:13] I'm getting more out of the app there's
[19:16] just something about having it so handy
[19:19] I can take it in the yard I can take it
[19:22] to every room in the house there's just
[19:24] something about it so handy and she's
[19:26] going back and re watching and re
[19:29] listening and she said I'm getting so
[19:32] many new and fresh thoughts of ideas and
[19:35] revelations and encouragement by hearing
[19:38] what I've already heard so anyway that
[19:41] was unplanned I was just gonna spend
[19:45] three minutes mentioning the app but we
[19:48] believe that it is again another way our
[19:51] partnership with the gospel channel is
[19:53] another way that God is giving us to do
[19:57] what he's called us to do and you know I
[20:00] think sometimes the enemy tries to
[20:02] intimidate all of us and and say well
[20:06] know what makes you special and and why
[20:09] do you have so feel like you have so
[20:11] much to say but but really if God has
[20:15] called you if God is placed a calling on
[20:18] your life there is something in you that
[20:21] needs to come out and it will come out
[20:25] when you open your mouth when you
[20:27] surrender to the call of God on your
[20:29] life and it will come out in a way that
[20:32] only you could do it
[20:33] it will be said in a way that only you
[20:36] can say it if it's if it's art it will
[20:39] be painted in a way that only you could
[20:41] paint it and that makes it special it
[20:45] really does
[20:46] it doesn't mean you know we get
[20:48] criticized sometime people say you know
[20:50] you're always you're coming up with
[20:52] something you're doing all these
[20:53] different things it looks like you're
[20:55] promoting yourself well I I want you to
[20:57] know nothing could be farther from our
[20:59] heart it is not our desire it's not my
[21:03] desire to promote me because I am I am
[21:07] less than an ordinary Joe but because I
[21:11] know I'm called you know I I gotta say I
[21:14] know I know that he called me in my
[21:17] mother's womb and can I do things as
[21:20] well as someone else there are lots of
[21:22] things that I know up front I can't do
[21:25] as good as somebody else does but I can
[21:27] only do them when I do them I do them
[21:30] with the gifts the callings the
[21:33] abilities the talents that God has given
[21:34] me and it's gonna reach somebody you and
[21:38] I could preach the same sermon from the
[21:40] same notes and I would be able to reach
[21:43] someone that you would not be able to
[21:45] reach and vice versa you know some some
[21:48] people would be turning channels and
[21:50] they'd say I hate plaid and that guy's
[21:52] got on a plaid shirt and just keep keep
[21:54] turning or I hate chunky guys with
[21:57] glasses and just keep turning but but
[22:00] you might be sitting here with a nice
[22:01] striped shirt on and skinny as a rail
[22:03] and and that might be something that
[22:06] they'd rather watch and listen to and I
[22:09] said all that just to let you know that
[22:11] we are special you are special you who
[22:15] have said yes to the call of God on your
[22:17] life whether it's serving your neighbors
[22:19] in your neighborhood whether it's
[22:21] serving in the pulpit whether it's it's
[22:24] holding an office in your local
[22:25] congregation or as an intercessor for a
[22:29] local ministry a regional ministry an
[22:32] international ministry don't let the
[22:34] enemy intimidate you and we don't go
[22:37] forth promoting ourselves or trying to
[22:39] force our way in or push doors open I
[22:43] want you to know that
[22:44] that I call zero pastors and have called
[22:49] zero pastors in all these years of
[22:52] ministry to ask for an opportunity to
[22:54] speak I do not ever know of a time I
[22:58] can't think of a time ever since since I
[23:02] started the ministry in 1975 that's a
[23:06] lot of years now I don't remember one
[23:08] time that I ever picked up the phone and
[23:10] there were times that pastors would say
[23:12] call me when you've got an opening but I
[23:14] don't ever remember a time that I picked
[23:16] up the phone and said could you use the
[23:18] ministry do you have an open open date
[23:21] would you like for us to come by I
[23:24] didn't do that because I trusted and I'm
[23:28] not against that if that's how if that's
[23:30] how you've evangelize
[23:31] god bless you and be with you and thank
[23:34] God for open doors but I just sort of
[23:37] purposed in my heart and for years as an
[23:40] evangelist I needed open doors
[23:42] I wasn't pastoring and I needed those
[23:44] doors but God would open them in his
[23:47] timing so I want you to just note right
[23:50] now don't be discouraged if you're not
[23:53] seeing the open doors if you're not if
[23:55] you feel like you're not carrying the
[23:57] influence right now that God has
[24:00] intended for you to carry and and and
[24:03] things are just going bad you're getting
[24:05] a lot of criticism and look just draw
[24:08] near to the Lord use this time to draw
[24:11] your heart near to him because God has a
[24:14] timing for everything in our lives
[24:17] there's a reason for everything whether
[24:20] we can see it or not and there is a
[24:23] timing for everything so I just
[24:26] encourage you to to take advantage of
[24:28] all these different ways that you can
[24:30] connect not because we're so special but
[24:34] because we're doing what God has called
[24:37] us to do he's special the truth of God
[24:40] is special and we're going to present it
[24:43] in a unique way a different way than
[24:46] someone else and I know I can say
[24:49] confidently that I know they're going to
[24:51] be those of you on the other end of this
[24:54] television program
[24:56] the other end of the app on the other
[24:58] end of the YouTube channel I know that
[25:01] they're going to be those of you who are
[25:02] going to be blessed and helped and
[25:04] encouraged because that's the promise
[25:06] that the Lord made me he actually spoke
[25:09] into my heart as a very young boy and
[25:11] said you open your mouth and I will fill
[25:14] it and you know I wished I could say
[25:17] that I've that every time I've ever
[25:19] opened my mouth there was always him
[25:21] speaking but I can't say that because I
[25:23] have lots to say sometime just on my own
[25:26] but I can tell you that every time I've
[25:29] ever had to stand up and speak in his
[25:31] name he has inspired he has blessed he
[25:34] has encouraged he has helped me and I
[25:37] know others have been helped so I want
[25:38] you to know that all of these different
[25:40] outreaches are not to promote us I have
[25:44] a wonderful congregation of people I
[25:46] have a wonderful staff who have gifts
[25:49] and callings in their life but we're not
[25:51] here promoting us who we are but we're
[25:54] letting you know that there's a better
[25:56] life there's a better life in Jesus
[25:59] Christ there's even a better life than
[26:01] just Church Church is wonderful it's
[26:04] wonderful to be gathered together with
[26:06] with those of precious like faith but I
[26:09] want you to know that God wants to pour
[26:11] into your life and he wants to minister
[26:14] to you not only when you're sitting in
[26:17] church three times a week if you're that
[26:19] faithful but he wants to meet with you
[26:22] commune with you fellowship with you on
[26:24] a day-to-day basis and you're the only
[26:27] one who can open that door and create
[26:30] that atmosphere it's not going to happen
[26:32] automatic it's not likely that God's
[26:35] gonna come banging on your door and say
[26:37] hey I want some time with you you're
[26:39] going to have to to take the
[26:41] responsibility as a disciple and carve
[26:44] out the time and carve out the
[26:48] opportunity but when you do that in
[26:50] faith and you say lord I need you to
[26:53] meet with me by your printer presence
[26:55] with your presence I need you to meet
[26:57] with me with revelation and
[26:59] understanding of your word I just need
[27:02] to know that you're on the other end
[27:04] that we are connected and even though
[27:07] it's dark
[27:08] and I'm lonely and I'm struggling I need
[27:11] to know that you're out there I need to
[27:13] know that you're carrying me I need to
[27:16] be reminded that when I see those one
[27:18] set of footprints in the sand that
[27:20] you're carrying me we mentioned that on
[27:23] a broadcast not too very long ago so
[27:25] that's my I'm not going to say
[27:28] sermonette because I remember an
[27:30] evangelist in the United States who used
[27:34] to preach all over the world and and
[27:37] maybe still does to some extent but he
[27:39] used to say a sermonette is for a
[27:42] Christian ette who needs a bassinet so
[27:45] I'm not gonna say that was the
[27:46] sermonette but it was a little bit
[27:48] unplanned and it was an advertisement
[27:52] for the app it's free so it was a free
[27:55] ad but it was also for somebody I really
[27:59] believe that there is somebody watching
[28:02] this who just struggles in that area
[28:05] what do I have to give that's not
[28:07] already being given what do I have to
[28:09] say that's not already being said and it
[28:12] may not be that you've got something
[28:14] that hasn't been said but I'll tell you
[28:16] what it is you will say it in a way that
[28:21] somebody will be able to hear it and
[28:23] that somebody is it's for ordained of
[28:27] God if God gives you a message if he
[28:31] gives you a theme in your heart and in
[28:33] your life and he prepares truth in you
[28:36] he is preparing somebody it may not be
[28:41] the crowd of 25,000 could be it might be
[28:45] but he's preparing somebody to hear that
[28:50] word who needs to hear it from you
[28:53] because you're the one that God gave it
[28:55] to so don't be discouraged we need men
[28:58] and women of God we need people of God
[29:01] who will be faithful to the call and so
[29:05] anyway check out our website revival org
[29:08] send us your prayer requests we'll be
[29:11] more than happy to pray with you about
[29:13] them and even rejoice with you when the
[29:16] when the victory comes if you'll send

[29:33] that be a blessing in your life and
[29:35] we're gonna keep adding to that and
[29:37] there there'll even be some printed
[29:38] articles and things that that you will
[29:40] have access to on that app it's really
[29:43] convenient now in the time that I have
[29:46] left I want to go back to our theme part
[29:49] 5 in the fullness of time we had great
[29:54] comments about episode 4 where we talked
[29:58] about the seed of the woman and this
[30:02] messianic prophecy that is so powerful
[30:05] and and really so encouraging because
[30:08] God has done through Jesus exactly what
[30:12] was prophesied that he would do but
[30:15] let's always go back to the foundation
[30:17] of the series we try to do that no
[30:20] matter what the teaching is galatians
[30:22] chapter 4 verse 1 through 7 now i say
[30:26] that the air as long as he is a child
[30:29] differeth nothing from a servant though
[30:32] he be Lord of all but is under tutors
[30:35] and governors until the time appointed
[30:38] of the Father so already we're getting
[30:42] this message that there is an appointed
[30:45] time a chosen time and what I have found
[30:51] out about the Lord is Jesus keeps all of
[30:54] his appointments you and I get slack
[30:57] some time we may run late some time we
[30:59] may have to plus postpone we might have
[31:02] to postpone an appointment we might even
[31:04] have to reschedule we might even have to
[31:07] cancel but Jesus keeps all of his
[31:10] appointments he is operating in the time
[31:15] appointed no doubt about it
[31:17] even so we when we were children were in
[31:20] bondage under the elements of the world
[31:22] but when the fullness of the time was
[31:26] come when time was filled up to the
[31:31] measure that God four or
[31:34] deigned it to be everything set in order
[31:39] the beautiful blueprint of God fulfilled
[31:44] to the right place when the fullness of
[31:48] the time was come God sent forth his son
[31:52] made of a woman made under the law to
[31:56] redeem them that were under the law that
[31:59] we might receive the adoption of sons
[32:03] and because your sons God hath sent
[32:08] forth the spirit of his son into your
[32:12] hearts crying Abba Father wherefore thou
[32:17] art no more a servant but a son and if a
[32:21] son then an heir of God through Christ
[32:25] so we have studied scripturally and and
[32:30] when I was looking over a list of the
[32:32] scriptures that we have covered already
[32:35] in this series we have covered a number
[32:39] of scriptures thirteen scriptures in the
[32:44] last episode 9 in the episode before 11
[32:48] in the episode before that so we're
[32:51] really studying and learning a lot about
[32:55] scriptures that that some of these
[32:59] scriptures we've read many times in our
[33:02] in our Christian life but when we pull
[33:05] them together in the context of
[33:07] understanding that God had a plan before
[33:12] the world began and that plan is
[33:16] unfolding and you and I eventually we
[33:20] stepped on the stage as actors in the
[33:23] great drama that God had in his mind
[33:26] before the foundation of the world and
[33:29] you may feel like a complete and total
[33:31] failure right now but I want you to know
[33:35] that if you are a son of God you're
[33:38] going to succeed you are going to
[33:42] fulfill the man
[33:43] sure of what God has placed in your life
[33:47] and determined that you would do in this
[33:51] earth if you will continue to surrender
[33:55] and to submit yourself to his sovereign
[33:58] will your emotions my emotions will get
[34:02] in the way and and those those ants do
[34:06] you remember when we talked about ants
[34:09] automatic negative thoughts those ants
[34:13] will get in the way
[34:14] those programmed thoughts they didn't
[34:19] just come out of the blue we programmed
[34:21] them in by agreeing with the lies and we
[34:26] agreed with the lies and we agreed with
[34:28] the lies until those thoughts became a
[34:31] part of the real estate of our brain
[34:35] this is not this is not speculation it's
[34:39] brain science
[34:40] every time you entertain that negative
[34:43] thought ponder on it wake up in the
[34:45] middle of the night and think about it
[34:47] it is driven farther and farther into
[34:51] the deep recesses of your memory and
[34:53] therefore if you come into any kind of
[34:56] environment or atmosphere that could
[34:59] remind you of where you were what you
[35:03] were doing what you were seeing what you
[35:05] were hearing what you were smelling when
[35:07] those thoughts troubled you in the past
[35:09] and guess what here comes the ants
[35:13] automatic negative thoughts to destroy
[35:16] the picnic despoil you your life your
[35:20] mental health your emotional health and
[35:23] this is what we have to to be aware of I
[35:27] cannot tell you enough the importance of
[35:33] determining in your life I've got to
[35:35] stay healthy in my thoughts I must stay
[35:39] healthy in my thoughts
[35:40] we know that it's so much deeper now
[35:43] than just mind over matter and the power
[35:45] of positive thinking and and something
[35:48] that we dismissed years ago is just a
[35:51] bunch of self-help jargon but I want you
[35:54] to know it's way more than that the
[35:56] scripture is
[35:57] clear that as a man thinketh as a man
[36:01] thinketh in his heart in his mind so he
[36:05] is and some translations indicate that
[36:09] he becomes the man that he thinks he is
[36:14] I believe I believe that we can only
[36:17] become what God has thought about us
[36:20] when we align our thoughts with what he
[36:25] has thought about us and Satan is not
[36:27] going to lay down and play dead while
[36:30] you and I just step up into the fullness
[36:33] of our calling no no no we've said that
[36:36] multiple times on this program he is
[36:40] active he is seeking whom he may devour
[36:43] going back and forth like that roaring
[36:45] lion he is the accuser of the Brethren
[36:48] he is twisting words and doing
[36:54] everything that he can to break
[36:56] relationships and sever relationships
[36:59] and cut you off and separate you from
[37:01] the body from your family from your
[37:05] faith family and he's doing that because
[37:08] he wants to make it easier to pick you
[37:11] off because that's how it happens even
[37:14] in the animal kingdom if that if that
[37:18] aggressor if that predator can can find
[37:23] a victim a lamb or or a gazelle an
[37:28] antelope that has become weakened in its
[37:32] condition and because of its weakness
[37:34] it's separated from the group it's so
[37:38] much easier for even one adversary one
[37:41] wolf one lion to swoop in and carry that
[37:45] weakened separated member off into
[37:49] destruction Satan doesn't want to break
[37:50] your leg Satan wants to devour you he
[37:54] wants to completely destroy you and
[37:56] cheat you bankrupt you of everything
[38:00] that God has promised you in your life
[38:02] but if you are filled with the Holy
[38:04] Ghost
[38:05] then greater is He that is in you than
[38:08] he
[38:09] is in the world and God has this great
[38:12] big plan not only for planet Earth
[38:14] not only for generations past not only
[38:18] for all the big stars you know sometimes
[38:22] we look at people and we say oh they're
[38:24] there they're fulfilling such a big role
[38:26] they're just so amazing they're just so
[38:28] wonderful
[38:30] sometimes people watch on television and
[38:33] they make heroes out of movie stars and
[38:36] sports stars and singers and they think
[38:39] that because they are on stage singing
[38:41] and smiling and dancing and wiggling and
[38:44] and everything looks okay they're
[38:46] thinking wow that person has reached the
[38:48] pinnacle of success well if you're
[38:50] talking about a bank account then maybe
[38:53] those people have reached the pinnacle
[38:55] of their success but I want you to know
[38:57] that if they don't have a personal
[38:59] relationship with Jesus Christ they are
[39:01] emotionally bankrupt I don't care how
[39:05] good-looking the husband is how
[39:07] beautiful the wife is how amazing the
[39:10] home is and how extensive the auto
[39:13] collection is if they're not if they
[39:16] don't have that God connection because
[39:19] man was created with that void with that
[39:23] vacuum with that need for God not in a
[39:27] religious connection that you that you
[39:29] get on paper only
[39:31] but in that spirit to spirit communion
[39:34] and spirit to spirit fellowship and I
[39:39] want you to know that even after all of
[39:40] these years of serving the Lord since I
[39:43] was a seven-year-old boy and I am
[39:46] getting very close to my 51st birthday
[39:49] now and many times through those years
[39:56] the enemy has stepped in and tried to
[39:59] sabotage my closeness to the Lord the
[40:03] very one who loves me the most who wants
[40:06] my attention my fellowship the most
[40:10] Satan has tried and why because it's
[40:13] that twisting spirit it's that dividing
[40:16] divisive spirit that the enemy will send
[40:19] against us if I can pull you away from
[40:21] the
[40:22] oh away from other believers away
[40:24] from the atmosphere of what what we get
[40:27] when we come together and worship the
[40:29] Lord corporately I know that we need the
[40:32] be alone times of worship brother sister
[40:36] if I didn't have that I wouldn't be
[40:38] sitting here today if I was only here
[40:41] today because of the strength that I
[40:43] have gained in church I don't think I'd
[40:47] be here I don't I really don't think and
[40:50] I've had I've been in some unbelievable
[40:53] services but the biggest portion of my
[40:57] sustaining grace and strength has come
[41:00] from those alone times with the Lord we
[41:02] need that we've got to have it
[41:04] but there is also that corporate
[41:06] anointing that's released when we come
[41:09] together and begin to worship the Lord
[41:11] what amazes me is sometimes like this
[41:14] past Saturday night there was such an
[41:17] atmosphere that came in our service as
[41:19] we begin to worship the Lord and I
[41:21] looked around and I saw many people that
[41:23] were connected
[41:26] you're the king of all the ages and you
[41:30] need 1/3 of salvation you're the reason
[41:35] why we're singing
[41:41] release the sound
[41:44] let it rise in every
[41:47] nation
[41:49] [Music]
[41:55] you're the
[41:58] father if you're that all-consuming fire
[42:02] no the reason are we
[42:06] [Music]
[42:10] we will be the generation calling down
[42:17] real joy
[42:23] be there ten
[42:25] [Music]
[42:37] we live
[42:40] [Music]
[42:48] hi
[42:50] and really feeling the presence of God
[42:54] and enjoying their time of worship and
[42:57] expressing their love for the Lord and
[42:59] then I had a call a few days later from
[43:02] a sister who had received the most awful
[43:04] news concerning the help of her husband
[43:08] and she was in her car the phone I think
[43:11] laying beside her streaming the worship
[43:14] from our church that Saturday night and
[43:16] she said my son was leading worship
[43:20] she said Benjamin had no way of knowing
[43:23] what I was dealing with how alone I was
[43:27] feeling at that moment but the
[43:29] atmosphere I could feel it in my
[43:32] automobile all that blesses me that
[43:35] blesses me because we were having a
[43:38] corporate moment she was having an
[43:40] individual moment and yet I realize that
[43:44] there were other people perhaps if you
[43:46] talk to them later they'd say well yeah
[43:48] we had a good service we had a good
[43:49] worship service Saturday night but but
[43:53] not not really having experienced
[43:56] anything particular and a lot of times
[43:58] that's just because these things are a
[44:00] bit relevant it's whether or not you're
[44:03] making the extra effort to be connected
[44:05] I'm going to be connected we talked
[44:08] about how well connected we are because
[44:10] of all of our technology and our devices
[44:12] and I'm I'm not here to criticize that
[44:16] because I believe God is using
[44:18] television there is a lot of filth and
[44:21] garbage and rottenness on the television
[44:24] but God is using networks like the
[44:28] gospel channel to give us a platform to
[44:30] be who God has called us to be and share
[44:33] with you what God is placed in our lives
[44:35] and and people are being changed and
[44:37] affected by it in a profound way there
[44:40] there's pornography and smut and and
[44:44] hideous things on the internet but God
[44:48] is using the Internet the the smartphone
[44:51] gives you access to darkness to
[44:54] witchcraft to to to the worst of the
[44:58] first but that also gives you access to
[45:02] gospel truth that can change you so what
[45:06] makes the difference in every one of
[45:07] those situations me you as an individual
[45:12] what I choose I choose to use the
[45:16] Internet to help me in my ministry I
[45:19] choose to use the Internet to help me
[45:22] stay connected to what is happening in
[45:24] other places there are services I don't
[45:27] often get to stream other churches live
[45:30] but there are other services that I
[45:32] enjoy over the course of a week
[45:34] plugging in hearing what's being said in
[45:38] the preaching of the word and in many
[45:41] cases enjoying the music and being
[45:44] blessed and inspired by that sometimes
[45:47] while I'm doing something at my desk I
[45:49] have that playing in the background I
[45:51] chose I could have used it for the
[45:54] garbage I could have used it to go
[45:56] looking for the filth it's there but I
[45:58] chose to use it to encourage and
[46:00] strengthen myself in the same way with
[46:02] the cell phone it can connect you to
[46:05] everything that is unlike God but it can
[46:08] also help you stay focused on the things
[46:12] that you need to and I have to be honest
[46:15] with you I use social media I use social
[46:18] media for different things and I know
[46:21] there's a lot of stuff on social media
[46:24] that's not godly and there's a lot of it
[46:26] that's frankly depressing it gives some
[46:30] people an opportunity to be who they're
[46:32] not and you don't ever become better by
[46:35] being who you're not you become better
[46:37] by recognizing where who you are and
[46:39] asking the Lord to give you strength so
[46:42] it's not good to pretend it's not good
[46:45] to live with pretense but but I want you
[46:48] to know that social media can be a tool
[46:50] for you to express what God is doing in
[46:54] your life having gone through some
[46:57] surgery some years back I cannot tell
[47:01] you what it meant to me when I didn't
[47:04] feel like begging for prayer I didn't
[47:06] feel like doing a lot of things but but
[47:10] someone could post a prayer request for
[47:12] me and when I felt strong enough I could
[47:14] go down and read we're praying for you
[47:16] brother Shelly we know God's gonna heal
[47:18] you he's gonna and I have to tell you
[47:20] that encouraged me and strengthened me
[47:22] but I have to make the choice and I have
[47:25] to I said all of that to say that I've
[47:28] been spending less time on Facebook and
[47:31] Instagram lately because I now have the
[47:34] new hope revival ministries app and I
[47:37] know that sounds kind of self-serving or
[47:40] funny or whatever but I mean that I'm
[47:42] hearing sermons and and I'm listening to
[47:45] things I'm getting to hear things that I
[47:48] had access to i sermons of brother
[47:51] branham and servants of brother green
[47:52] and brother green's testimony and the
[47:54] life story of brother Branham things I
[47:57] could have access but because it's right
[47:59] there on my phone I can just listen when
[48:03] I was getting ready to come to the
[48:05] office today and and and tape these
[48:07] programs I was listening to a sermon of
[48:09] brother Branham and it happened to be
[48:11] one of the sermons from Birmingham
[48:13] Alabama when my grandmother was in the
[48:16] service and and I couldn't hear her a
[48:19] man's and I couldn't see her but it
[48:22] warmed my heart to know that that this
[48:25] was way back in what 64 and 1964 and I'm
[48:29] listening to the same message that she
[48:32] was listening to that night it blessed
[48:34] me and so we make we have to make the
[48:37] right choice we have to decide there are
[48:40] certain things I cannot have in my life
[48:42] there are certain things that I need in
[48:45] my life there are certain things I want
[48:47] in my life but I have to I have to make
[48:50] up my mind I have to discipline myself I
[48:53] have to stay in these godly boundaries
[48:55] because I believe that we are in the end
[49:00] of the end time and I believe they're
[49:03] the only thing that's holding back the
[49:05] rapture and resurrection of the Bride of
[49:07] Christ is that there are there is more
[49:10] work to be done I hope you don't find
[49:14] that as a contradiction for me to say I
[49:16] believe we're almost there and then tell
[49:19] you I believe there's more to be done
[49:21] I I don't believe that's a contradiction
[49:23] and I don't want you to see it that way
[49:25] I believe that if you can feel in your
[49:30] spirit that we're getting nearer to that
[49:32] time then you must also be able to find
[49:35] that place of deeper surrender Lord what
[49:38] do you want me to do
[49:39] what do you want me to say who do you
[49:41] want me to be remember that it's not
[49:44] always the doing more but it is always
[49:49] the surrendering more the submitting
[49:52] more to what God's will and plan is and
[49:55] if you want to know what someone filled
[49:58] with the Spirit of God lives like or
[50:02] should live like well we look at Jesus
[50:04] as our ultimate example now that being
[50:07] said we can't all be itinerant ministers
[50:11] wandering around the countryside with a
[50:13] few disciples but his life was about the
[50:17] kingdom and he lived it in the life that
[50:21] God had called him to live that he was
[50:23] to live at that time we can model that
[50:27] we can so fill our lives with the wisdom
[50:30] of the word that when people ask
[50:34] questions when they inquire about our
[50:37] faith we have the wisdom of the word the
[50:40] knowledge of the word the revelation of
[50:42] the word to give them instead of the dry
[50:46] can't those those canned answers that
[50:50] religion sometimes provides it feels
[50:54] like I've been just a bit scattered in
[50:56] this program but I I have to tell you I
[50:59] I feel the pool of faith I feel like
[51:02] there are those on the other end of this
[51:04] camera who are pulling because you need
[51:09] a burst of energy of strength and focus
[51:14] I'm going to do something I don't
[51:17] usually do but I'm gonna stop right now
[51:19] we have about eight minutes left I want
[51:22] to pray right now I want to pray that as
[51:25] you make up your mind right now this
[51:29] moment to tune your spiritual dial to
[51:33] folk
[51:34] on the Lord to focus on the one who
[51:37] loves you the most and he knows you you
[51:41] know you may be hiding something from
[51:43] people but you're not hiding anything
[51:45] from God he already knows and he loves
[51:49] you just as you are but he loves you too
[51:53] much to leave you that way he wants to
[51:56] bring change he wants to give you
[51:59] strength to make changes that need to be
[52:01] made I'm speaking to some discouraged
[52:04] workers too some servants of the Cross
[52:09] who have really been dealing with
[52:12] heaviness and discouragement
[52:16] hopelessness but I just want you to know
[52:20] right now if you'll focus if you'll turn
[52:22] that dial back toward the Lord right now
[52:25] when we pray I believe God will give you
[52:28] the strategy to start dealing with that
[52:31] hopelessness that darkness that's trying
[52:33] to surround you father in the name of
[52:36] the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah
[52:40] we approach you today in the natural we
[52:45] have no way of knowing who's watching
[52:47] this program but Lord you do you know
[52:51] right now whether this is being seen on
[52:53] the gospel channel or on the app or on
[52:57] YouTube and you know exactly who's
[52:59] sitting in front of this message right
[53:02] now and Lord I'm just sensing so deeply
[53:05] that there are some very discouraged
[53:08] servants of the Cross and I ask right
[53:12] now that you will release strategy and
[53:15] answers to their deepest questions I
[53:19] pray that you will help them find the
[53:22] truth the answer that they're searching
[53:24] for and that they will rise up with such
[53:27] faith that darkness scatters that
[53:31] hopelessness is dealt with by answered
[53:34] prayer Lord the best way I know to see
[53:37] Hope deferred and hopelessness dealt
[53:41] with is for you to come on the scene
[53:44] with answered prayer and
[53:46] asking you in faith right now according
[53:49] to your will I don't know your plan for
[53:52] each individual's live but I trust you
[53:55] and I know you do I pray that whatever
[53:58] the hindrance is if it's unconfessed sin
[54:01] that's keeping the answers to the prayer
[54:04] from coming I pray right now that the
[54:06] grace of God will touch their heart and
[54:08] they will confess to you in repentance
[54:11] of what needs to be made right and
[54:15] plunged beneath your blood and and have
[54:19] the spirit of justification operating in
[54:21] that area of their life I pray that
[54:24] whatever it is if it's if it's leagues
[54:27] if it is connections that have been made
[54:30] partnerships that have been made that
[54:33] are unhealthy if there are alliances
[54:37] that have been made relationships that
[54:40] have been formed that are not of God
[54:42] that the enemy has raised up to try to
[54:45] stop the flow of the anointing and God's
[54:48] blessings in their lives I pray that you
[54:51] will reveal that and not only will you
[54:54] reveal it but that you will release the
[54:56] courage to do something about those
[54:59] relationships to break unholy alliances
[55:03] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[55:07] pray right now that you will take this
[55:11] effort that we have put forth today and
[55:14] let these words ring in somebody's heart
[55:18] if they're not ready to pray with me
[55:20] right now I pray that you will keep
[55:22] pressing and keep moving over them until
[55:26] they are ready to call on you I pray
[55:28] that you'll give some the courage to
[55:30] write this ministry to call this
[55:31] ministry and let us know I was one of
[55:34] those battling with discouragement and
[55:36] hopelessness but I'm I have a little
[55:39] little restored hope and energy to press
[55:43] into the more something is beginning to
[55:46] move and I am going to go with a new
[55:49] determination until every bit of that is
[55:52] broken off of my life Lord we ask this
[55:56] because we know it is vitally important
[55:59] that
[55:59] we all surrender our gifts and talents
[56:02] and callings to you we are a part of
[56:05] this great big plan this great big
[56:07] blueprint in the fullness of the times
[56:10] and so we just ask right now that
[56:13] healing would flow to those who are
[56:15] fighting some are not just fighting
[56:18] sickness but they are underneath an
[56:20] attack of the spirit of infirmity and
[56:22] Lord we ask right now that as our faith
[56:25] joins with their faith you will send the
[56:28] spirit of infirmity packing that he must
[56:31] go right now take his hands off the
[56:34] children of the Most High God let there
[56:37] be deliverance in areas where there has
[56:41] been addiction let somebody take a hold
[56:45] of the help that is being offered to
[56:48] them by the Holy Spirit right now Lord
[56:51] we ask that you bless the pastors and
[56:54] leaders who might be watching this
[56:57] program right now that they might go on
[56:59] with renewed vision and maybe they're at
[57:02] this place in their life right now
[57:03] because you want to take them into a new
[57:05] place of truth maybe you want to bring
[57:08] them to a deeper revelation of truth and
[57:10] so they're in this holding pattern it
[57:15] could be Lord that they're stalled
[57:17] because they can't go any higher where
[57:20] they are right now there they need
[57:22] another installment of revelatory
[57:25] knowledge and help that comes more of
[57:29] the unveiling of your word and your
[57:32] person in their life and so we just
[57:34] would ask that they would step up into
[57:37] that that there would be a hunger
[57:38] stirred we ask all of these things and
[57:42] for every need to be ministered to by
[57:45] the abundant grace and blessing we ask
[57:48] these things in the name of the Lord
[57:50] Jesus Christ and for his glory
[57:53] amen and amen I don't always close my
[57:58] eyes the entire time when I'm praying
[58:00] with you because I want to be mindful
[58:02] that you we're talking to the Lord but I
[58:05] want to be mindful that you're there I
[58:07] want to know and feel and sense and if
[58:10] you're watching this I
[58:11] you to know that that we're here because
[58:14] we haven't forgotten we do this because
[58:17] we want to reach out and and I'm going
[58:20] to say again I just believe that before
[58:23] we ever come into this little studio god
[58:25] knows who's going to see this he knows
[58:28] there will be critics he know that he
[58:30] knows that there will be those who don't
[58:32] need this who don't want this who are
[58:35] not interested in what we have to say
[58:37] they don't like the package maybe they
[58:40] don't like the blue wall maybe they
[58:43] don't like the sign over my head well
[58:45] you can't even read it your heads in the
[58:46] way I mean they're going to be people
[58:48] that way I don't like beards but God
[58:52] knows that you're going to be there as
[58:55] well and that you are going to receive
[58:59] something he knows when we come out
[59:01] that's he knows exactly who I might know
[59:05] somebody's going to but he knows who
[59:07] that somebody is
[59:08] and hopefully at somebody's we want to
[59:12] continue to pray with you about your
[59:13] place where you are right now your needs
[59:15] so reach out to the ministry the
[59:18] information will be given and you can
[59:21] let us know we're gonna keep praying for
[59:24] you standing with you because we love
[59:26] you god bless you bye bye for today
