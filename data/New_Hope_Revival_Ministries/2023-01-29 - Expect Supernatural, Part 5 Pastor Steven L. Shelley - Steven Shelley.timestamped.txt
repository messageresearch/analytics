[59:56] some time off soon uh somewhere
[1:00:00] beginning around the second week of
[1:00:02] February I'll be in for some of the
[1:00:05] weekends but I'll be away from the
[1:00:07] office for several weeks and looking
[1:00:10] forward to it very much
[1:00:13] um so let's get as many services
[1:00:15] together as we can and let's Rejoice
[1:00:18] that we don't have anything to worry
[1:00:19] about because brother Greeley is gone
[1:00:22] this weekend so he can be home for a
[1:00:24] while
[1:00:25] and without an emergency he's going to
[1:00:28] come and hold the fort and we're going
[1:00:30] to be led of the Lord over the course of
[1:00:32] the next couple of months to see what
[1:00:34] God has for us I've been praying hard
[1:00:37] and I'm ready to hear from him I'm I'm
[1:00:40] expecting to hear his voice over the
[1:00:42] next couple of months with direction for
[1:00:45] us for the rest of the year and Beyond
[1:00:48] we're getting closer to the Rapture than
[1:00:51] we've ever been before and there's so
[1:00:53] much in my heart that I want to see him
[1:00:56] do I want to be a candidate that he can
[1:00:59] use to accomplish those things before he
[1:01:02] comes and gets his bride how many of you
[1:01:04] understand that he's faithful he's going
[1:01:07] to do his but I want a part of it
[1:01:10] I'm a little selfish when it comes to
[1:01:12] that I want a part of what God's doing
[1:01:14] in the end time I want to be in the
[1:01:16] middle of it do you hear me
[1:01:18] I want to be in the middle of it and I'm
[1:01:20] sure you do as well and so let's
[1:01:22] position ourselves for what God has for
[1:01:24] us amen I won't be so far away that I
[1:01:28] can't get home in an emergency so you
[1:01:30] don't have anything to worry about and
[1:01:32] we'll let you know a little bit more
[1:01:34] about that as the weeks come come away
[1:01:35] we've got several weekends together
[1:01:37] before that happens but God is good and
[1:01:40] he is faithful would you turn with me to
[1:01:43] Romans where we were Tuesday night I
[1:01:45] didn't tell them up there that I would
[1:01:48] go back there but I want to go back to
[1:01:49] Romans 8 verses 17 through 25 we're
[1:01:54] going to read that today as we prepare
[1:01:56] to go into the word
[1:01:59] and I want to remind you that we serve a
[1:02:01] supernatural God
[1:02:03] he desires to use his Supernatural
[1:02:07] people in a supernatural way and he has
[1:02:10] supernaturally provided everything that
[1:02:13] we have need of to finish the course I
[1:02:17] want to remind you today that everything
[1:02:19] you need to make the Rapture is in you
[1:02:23] right now you're not waiting on another
[1:02:26] portion you're not waiting on more of
[1:02:29] something you're just waiting on a shift
[1:02:32] to take place on the inside of you that
[1:02:35] you would Embrace fully what God has
[1:02:38] already done on your behalf when our
[1:02:41] thoughts change our vocabulary begins to
[1:02:44] change and when our vocabulary changes
[1:02:47] our circumstances begin to change
[1:02:50] because we speak to them God wants to
[1:02:53] hear you sing he wants your voice to be
[1:02:57] spoken your body desires to hear your
[1:03:01] voice spoken with the authority of the
[1:03:03] creator that Authority is in you you
[1:03:07] didn't create this body he did but his
[1:03:10] authority resides in you if you let the
[1:03:14] doctor have more authority over your
[1:03:16] body than you have
[1:03:18] if you let him speak with more authority
[1:03:21] over your body than you speak You're
[1:03:24] missing your opportunity to take
[1:03:26] authority over what God has given you to
[1:03:29] live in it's your house
[1:03:31] and it's your place to Speak Life to
[1:03:36] every cell of your body if you believe
[1:03:39] that's amen so Romans chapter 8
[1:03:43] beginning in verse 17 and if children
[1:03:46] then heirs Heirs of God and join heirs
[1:03:51] with Christ if so be that we suffer with
[1:03:55] him that we may be also glorified
[1:03:59] together
[1:04:00] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:04:03] present time are not worthy to be
[1:04:06] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:04:09] revealed in us for the earnest
[1:04:12] expectation of the creature wadeth for
[1:04:16] the manifestation of the sons of God for
[1:04:21] the creature was made subject to vanity
[1:04:24] not willingly but by reason of him who
[1:04:28] hath subjected the same in Hope because
[1:04:32] the creature itself also shall be
[1:04:36] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[1:04:38] into the Glorious Liberty of the
[1:04:43] children of God thank you Lord for we
[1:04:47] know that the whole creation groaneth
[1:04:49] and travaileth in pain together until
[1:04:53] now Hallelujah and not only they but
[1:04:57] ourselves also which have the first
[1:05:00] fruits of the Spirit even we ourselves
[1:05:03] groan within ourselves waiting for the
[1:05:06] adoption to wit the Redemption of our
[1:05:10] body how many of you are looking for a
[1:05:12] body to be redeemed for we are saved by
[1:05:15] hope but hope that is seen is not hope
[1:05:18] for what a man seeth why doth he yet
[1:05:21] hope for
[1:05:22] but if we hope for that we see not then
[1:05:27] do we with patience wait for it how many
[1:05:33] of you are just waiting
[1:05:35] not waiting by doing nothing
[1:05:38] but waiting by doing everything
[1:05:41] we know to do
[1:05:43] we're waiting by doing everything we
[1:05:46] know to do to bring ourselves into a
[1:05:49] higher position I fought many battles in
[1:05:52] the night last night some on your behalf
[1:05:54] I don't know what you fought what you
[1:05:57] faced but God has given us the victory
[1:05:59] when the sun come up we had Victory and
[1:06:02] we're going to believe God now I think
[1:06:05] that presence that came in there a few
[1:06:07] moments ago was to just wash some of
[1:06:09] that off of my life and off of your life
[1:06:12] but let's just have a prayer before we
[1:06:14] go to the word fully today Father we
[1:06:17] thank you that you have won the war we
[1:06:20] thank you that you are the mighty
[1:06:22] conqueror we thank you that there's not
[1:06:24] a battle that you have not already won
[1:06:26] you're giving us Victory Day by Day
[1:06:30] sometimes minute by minute and we want
[1:06:33] to thank you for that now Lord the night
[1:06:36] was long and it was dark and the enemy
[1:06:39] tried so many times to attack and I I
[1:06:43] would dare say that I'm not the only one
[1:06:46] who battles in their mind last night but
[1:06:49] I thank you that you are my Victor I
[1:06:52] thank you that you have paid the price
[1:06:54] and the war is won the victory is mine I
[1:06:58] want to ask now Lord as we approach your
[1:07:01] word for myself and for anyone under the
[1:07:05] sound of my voice who's battling in
[1:07:07] their mind or has battled through the
[1:07:10] night with dreams or whatever the enemy
[1:07:13] might have used to distract them from
[1:07:16] this day we pray right now that the
[1:07:19] blood of Jesus be applied to our minds
[1:07:22] that our minds be painted with calvary's
[1:07:26] blood that we are able to see that we
[1:07:29] are purified that we are cleansed by
[1:07:33] that precious blood that nothing that
[1:07:36] the enemy would desire to hang on us can
[1:07:39] remain we shake it off
[1:07:42] we shake it off we shake it off in the
[1:07:47] authority of Jesus Christ if there be
[1:07:50] any heaviness over our lives because of
[1:07:53] what we have walked through or waded
[1:07:56] through we shake it off in the name of
[1:08:00] Jesus we ask that you come and kiss us
[1:08:03] with understanding from your word and we
[1:08:06] will give you glory and honor and praise
[1:08:10] for it's in the lovely name of our Lord
[1:08:13] Jesus Christ we pray and the saint said
[1:08:17] amen you may be seated God is so good to
[1:08:21] us
[1:08:22] he is so good to us
[1:08:25] we are his Supernatural bride he is so
[1:08:31] good to us
[1:08:33] Hallelujah
[1:08:34] well
[1:08:36] I just realized something
[1:08:39] I printed a new set of notes
[1:08:42] because I added to them
[1:08:45] but I didn't Circle things in my new
[1:08:49] ones that I had circled in my old ones
[1:08:51] so will you give me a minute to find my
[1:08:53] circles

[1:09:11] 1956 paragraph 70. these are some quotes
[1:09:15] that I've missed over the last few weeks
[1:09:17] and I want to call your attention to
[1:09:19] them
[1:09:21] and uh then we will move into just a
[1:09:24] little bit uh different angle this
[1:09:26] morning
[1:09:27] paragraph 70 Revelation book of symbols
[1:09:32] 1956 so is the Church of the Living God
[1:09:36] that's been born down in the middle of
[1:09:41] fanaticism and chaos
[1:09:44] but she's wound her way through the
[1:09:47] grime
[1:09:50] you're not listening to me yet
[1:09:52] she's wound her way through the grime
[1:09:56] until she's on top of the thing now
[1:09:58] Hallelujah
[1:10:01] how many of you been winding your way
[1:10:03] through some stuff wading your way
[1:10:06] wasn't that the prayer that we just
[1:10:07] prayed wading our way through some stuff
[1:10:10] some slop some Grime some slime but
[1:10:15] she's on top of the thing now brother
[1:10:17] random said spreading forth her wings
[1:10:20] for the flight she's getting ready for
[1:10:23] the Rapture many shall run to and fro
[1:10:26] and the people that know their God shall
[1:10:31] do exploits in that day how many of you
[1:10:34] believe that's the word that's our
[1:10:36] promise they shall know their God they
[1:10:38] shall be strong and they shall do
[1:10:41] exploits God's revelation to his church
[1:10:46] sit still Little Flock positionally stay
[1:10:51] where you are brother Branham is
[1:10:53] instructing us that we must not lose
[1:10:56] ground

[1:11:01] the spirit of God leading us but we
[1:11:03] cannot lose an itch we must sometimes
[1:11:07] stand still and see the salvation of the
[1:11:10] Lord so we remind ourselves today to
[1:11:14] positionally stay where we are don't
[1:11:17] back up don't compromise don't give in

[1:11:49] coming of Christ now and the great
[1:11:51] Millennium hear this
[1:11:53] do you want to understand the delay
[1:11:56] brother random is telling us where the
[1:11:58] delay comes from he said that's what's
[1:12:01] holding back the coming of Christ now
[1:12:04] and the great Millennium it's this great
[1:12:08] Supernatural power that really lays
[1:12:11] dormant in the church what will happen
[1:12:15] when we awaken that Supernatural power
[1:12:19] that is already in us we're not waiting
[1:12:22] for a place to go and get it we're not
[1:12:25] waiting for another portion of it we're
[1:12:28] waiting for something to awaken it
[1:12:30] within our spirit I want you to know I
[1:12:33] don't know anything better than praise
[1:12:36] to awaken what is dormant in your life
[1:12:41] I know the words the answer I know the
[1:12:44] word is the answer for everything but if
[1:12:46] you've got something dormant in your
[1:12:48] life connect
[1:12:50] to him and that's through our praise we
[1:12:55] can't sit through a service without
[1:12:57] raising our hands without engaging and
[1:13:00] entertaining the spirit of the Lord
[1:13:02] without welcoming him into our lives to
[1:13:06] engage with us we can't do that and
[1:13:09] expect that Supernatural power to raise
[1:13:12] up in us to the measure that we're
[1:13:14] looking for we've got to be engaged with
[1:13:17] him we've got to worship Him and praise
[1:13:21] him as many as you as many of you have
[1:13:24] learned to do it's this great
[1:13:25] Supernatural power that really lays
[1:13:28] dormant in the church if we can get that
[1:13:31] thing to wake up in us we don't have to
[1:13:33] wait any longer on the coming of Christ
[1:13:36] he's coming back for a church just like
[1:13:40] he birthed on the day of Pentecost he
[1:13:42] said it same power same signs same
[1:13:45] wonders
[1:13:47] same power
[1:13:49] same Authority this word has taken us
[1:13:52] right back to where he started the thing
[1:13:54] now we've got to catch a hold of that
[1:13:57] and allow God to awaken every part
[1:14:00] that's laying dormant in us so that we
[1:14:03] can step up and take our positions you
[1:14:06] believe that
[1:14:07] in The Invisible Union of the bride of
[1:14:10] Christ
[1:14:11] 1965. paragraph 325 brother Branham says
[1:14:16] Church
[1:14:18] you who I'm speaking to tonight Across
[1:14:22] the Nation
[1:14:23] if you've separated yourself from
[1:14:26] denomination
[1:14:28] and all the filth and things of this
[1:14:31] world and all those things that keeps
[1:14:34] you in man-made Creeds and orders and
[1:14:40] things like that you separated yourself
[1:14:43] look up
[1:14:45] get ready
[1:14:47] the fire is going to fall one of these
[1:14:51] days
[1:14:52] God is going to let him come and a sight
[1:14:56] to behold would you be ready when he
[1:14:58] comes would you be ready to go up with
[1:15:02] him when he comes the secret Rapture
[1:15:06] look at how he says it the secret
[1:15:09] Rapture of the
[1:15:16] the Rapture is Supernatural
[1:15:19] the resurrection is Supernatural and
[1:15:23] it's only for a supernatural people
[1:15:26] we need to understand here there are
[1:15:29] some who have asked questions lately and
[1:15:31] we need to understand again we may not
[1:15:33] like it we may not fully understand it
[1:15:36] but the Rapture resurrection that we're
[1:15:39] looking for is only for the bride of
[1:15:42] Christ
[1:15:44] we've been saying this for years it's
[1:15:47] what the prophet taught us
[1:15:49] we've been saying it for years and
[1:15:51] there's never ever a full amen
[1:15:55] there's always only a portion of an amen
[1:15:58] because we don't really like it that way
[1:16:01] but we didn't get to choose it that way
[1:16:04] God said the rest of the church is going
[1:16:07] to go through they're going to have to
[1:16:09] face some things
[1:16:10] they're going to have to get their dirty
[1:16:12] garments cleansed because truth matters
[1:16:16] I want you to look at somebody and say
[1:16:18] truth matters
[1:16:20] you can't believe anything you want to
[1:16:22] believe and be right you can't believe
[1:16:25] anything you want to believe and be
[1:16:26] ready for the Rapture You've Got to
[1:16:28] Believe
[1:16:29] I believe truth of
[1:16:31] that's why he said
[1:16:36] he sent to us so that we could come
[1:16:38] every time back to that word and know
[1:16:40] what we believe you don't have to worry
[1:16:42] about those who are not going in the
[1:16:44] Rapture they have the opportunity to do
[1:16:47] exactly what the word has said they will
[1:16:49] do they've called on the name of the
[1:16:52] Lord and they will have eternal life
[1:16:54] because they have called on the name of
[1:16:56] the Lord but their way their way their
[1:16:59] life may get extremely difficult when
[1:17:02] you and I leave here
[1:17:05] then what must I tell somebody to do so
[1:17:07] that they can become the bride it's not
[1:17:09] about becoming the bride it's about
[1:17:12] being the bride before the foundation of
[1:17:14] the world I know that people struggle
[1:17:17] with that but remember the scripture is
[1:17:19] clear God loved every nation
[1:17:22] he created nations of people but out of
[1:17:25] the Nations that he created
[1:17:27] he chose one and he said these are my
[1:17:30] chosen people
[1:17:31] this is my elect people he's done the
[1:17:35] same through the church ages he said now
[1:17:38] I'm going to raise up a people from
[1:17:39] among the Gentiles I'm going to put my
[1:17:42] name on them
[1:17:44] and I'm going to meet with him where I
[1:17:46] put my name it won't be the names of
[1:17:49] denominations or Creeds it'll only be
[1:17:52] under the revelation of Jesus Christ we
[1:17:55] must value what we have we must value
[1:17:58] what we've heard we must understand and
[1:18:02] live the life of joy and victory because
[1:18:05] God's given us a truth
[1:18:07] did we deserve it I doubt that
[1:18:10] would you have chose me
[1:18:14] would I have chose you
[1:18:18] think about it
[1:18:21] but he did
[1:18:25] anybody old enough to remember the old
[1:18:28] TV show Father Knows Best
[1:18:31] your father knew best
[1:18:34] Hallelujah I'm so glad he didn't choose
[1:18:37] me because he saw my behavior was always
[1:18:39] going to be right
[1:18:42] he chose me because he could
[1:18:45] he chose me because he looked ahead in
[1:18:47] my life and he saw that I was going to
[1:18:49] choose him and that nothing the world
[1:18:51] through at me was going to cause me to
[1:18:53] turn my back on him and nothing that the
[1:18:56] denominations did would so pollute my
[1:18:58] mind that I wouldn't look for his pure
[1:19:00] word
[1:19:01] he knew that when that pure word fell
[1:19:04] into my life I'd leave everything else
[1:19:06] and eat that
[1:19:07] and become transferred into the word
[1:19:11] changed into the word because I was
[1:19:14] blessed to eat the word
[1:19:16] it's big what we're talking about we're
[1:19:18] talking about the secret Rapture of the
[1:19:20] supernatural bride she'll be from Mortal
[1:19:23] to immortality be changed in a moment in
[1:19:28] a twinkling of an eye we which are alive
[1:19:31] and remain shall not prevent them which
[1:19:35] are asleep this Supernatural Rapture of
[1:19:39] the supernatural bride or as he said
[1:19:41] here this secret Rapture of the
[1:19:44] supernatural bride is our destiny
[1:19:48] it's our destiny do you know I've heard
[1:19:50] people say well I'm just not going to
[1:19:51] believe that anymore I I I'm just not
[1:19:53] going to believe that anymore I don't
[1:19:55] think I I'm the bride and I'm just not
[1:19:58] going to believe that anymore I'm just
[1:20:00] going to go find me a place to be an
[1:20:01] easy Christian somewhere folks I want to
[1:20:03] tell you something you don't get to make
[1:20:05] those kind of choices
[1:20:08] if you were born for this truth you'll
[1:20:10] walk in this truth or you'll you've
[1:20:12] never seen the hard life that's coming
[1:20:15] I'm telling you right now if this is a
[1:20:17] supernatural year we're going to see God
[1:20:19] dealing with his people in a
[1:20:21] supernatural way I wouldn't be surprised
[1:20:23] if the Holy Ghost doesn't come this year
[1:20:25] and start claiming what's his
[1:20:28] so you and I better give him everything
[1:20:30] that's his in our life right now we
[1:20:32] better lay it all down and surrender
[1:20:34] everything because I want you to know
[1:20:37] I don't even want to mention this or not
[1:20:40] but I listened this week to the lyrics
[1:20:43] of a song that Dolly Parton wrote
[1:20:49] now I say it's a it's really really a
[1:20:51] shame
[1:20:53] when somebody that looks like Dolly
[1:20:55] Parton is the one that has to release a
[1:20:57] message like like like she's released
[1:21:01] I don't have any reason to doubt that
[1:21:03] God gave her a dream
[1:21:05] she says that God gave her a dream and
[1:21:08] she wrote a song and released it on her
[1:21:10] birthday and and let me just give you
[1:21:12] the the gist of it the gist of it is
[1:21:15] I've been watching you don't make me
[1:21:17] come down there
[1:21:21] [Music]
[1:21:23] don't make me come down there and have
[1:21:25] to tend to you
[1:21:27] my I know you're being quiet because of
[1:21:30] the vessel I know you're being quiet I'm
[1:21:32] sure you're right go ahead get it out
[1:21:34] type it in
[1:21:37] I'm sure somebody will have something
[1:21:39] negative to say about me because I
[1:21:41] mentioned it but I listened to the song
[1:21:44] and I thought oh my goodness
[1:21:46] she's not only going to make sinner mad
[1:21:48] she's going to make the church mad
[1:21:51] because basically it says I've tried to
[1:21:53] tell you what to do I've tried to help
[1:21:56] you along the way and you keep doing it
[1:21:58] your own stubborn way and I'm going to
[1:22:00] have to come down and see about you
[1:22:05] I'll tell you when the bride goes out
[1:22:08] that's exactly what's going to happen
[1:22:10] he's going to come down and take care of
[1:22:12] some business that needs to be taken
[1:22:15] care of
[1:22:16] there's no there's no easy peism there's
[1:22:19] no just floating into eternal life
[1:22:22] it's a fight for everybody who has it
[1:22:25] even for you and I who've inherited it
[1:22:28] because he saw our choice and he chose
[1:22:31] us even we have to do some contending
[1:22:33] even we have to do some fighting we
[1:22:36] which are alive and remain shall not
[1:22:38] prevent them which are asleep this is
[1:22:40] our destiny and I am so thankful for
[1:22:42] that I want to give God the praise
[1:22:45] I wanna I wanna catch one that we had
[1:22:48] already from from the message Queen of
[1:22:51] Sheba paragraph 10
[1:22:53] . I've circled it but we've already had
[1:22:56] this one but I want us to have it again
[1:22:57] and yes I'm jumping around and it'll
[1:23:00] take her a minute or two to get them and
[1:23:03] uh already she already has some struggle
[1:23:05] with the computer moving fast enough but
[1:23:08] uh we're we're willing to wait now they
[1:23:12] was falling they was failing they was
[1:23:15] failing to see his Supernatural work the
[1:23:18] people the churches had gotten so far
[1:23:20] away from the supernatural until they
[1:23:22] could not give an answer to their
[1:23:24] congregation for the supernatural that
[1:23:27] was being done so they just had to class
[1:23:29] at something
[1:23:30] you know this is a problem where we are
[1:23:33] right now
[1:23:34] no one is supposed to see a vision
[1:23:36] except brother Branham
[1:23:39] that doesn't line up with the Bible
[1:23:42] uh maybe you got that out of some
[1:23:44] isolated quote in a church age book but
[1:23:46] you didn't get that out of the message
[1:23:48] and if you found that you didn't find it
[1:23:51] in the word
[1:23:53] the Bible tells us old men will dream
[1:23:55] dreams young men will see visions
[1:23:58] no one is going to come and take that
[1:24:01] messenger's place but God's going to
[1:24:03] have a supernatural people that he deals
[1:24:05] with in a supernatural way
[1:24:11] and even the Rapture is going to be a
[1:24:13] supernatural thing
[1:24:14] and so you know I think sometimes
[1:24:16] they've used reverence as an excuse for
[1:24:19] death
[1:24:22] now let's be very reverent now let's be
[1:24:25] very reverent let's worship very
[1:24:27] reverently let's move very reverently
[1:24:30] let's be very reverent we wouldn't want
[1:24:33] anybody to think we have the Holy Ghost
[1:24:34] around here
[1:24:36] we wouldn't want anybody to think we'd
[1:24:38] gotten a hold of a live wire around here
[1:24:40] come on
[1:24:42] so they have to start making excuses in
[1:24:44] brother branham's day they had to
[1:24:45] explain to their congregations why these
[1:24:48] things were over
[1:24:49] because they couldn't have people going
[1:24:51] down to the Brandon campaign and seeing
[1:24:52] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:24:55] and forever so they took to their
[1:24:57] pulpits and they started explaining how
[1:24:59] these things were done away and many
[1:25:01] people boldly called it Devils the
[1:25:03] workings of devils
[1:25:04] now we come all the way through and the
[1:25:07] messages found us and has reached
[1:25:10] thousands tens hundreds of thousands of
[1:25:12] people around the world and many of us
[1:25:14] have fallen back into this easy this
[1:25:17] easy place of of just relaxing and you
[1:25:21] know a great big spiritual vacation
[1:25:25] while the enemy just Delights
[1:25:28] with the way he's ruining marriages and
[1:25:30] ruining lives and running children out
[1:25:33] of the faith
[1:25:34] somebody's got to raise up and say hey
[1:25:37] we're the supernatural people that the
[1:25:39] prophet prophesied and we're going to
[1:25:42] see God moving in Supernatural ways
[1:25:45] instead of figuring it out laying aside
[1:25:47] their thoughts and going to the
[1:25:48] scriptures instead of that they just
[1:25:50] answered their congregation said why
[1:25:52] he's the devil that's all he's just a
[1:25:54] fortune teller or something there's
[1:25:55] nothing to him they had to say something
[1:25:58] they had to answer something they
[1:26:00] couldn't tell the whole truth but then
[1:26:02] when he did that Supernatural
[1:26:06] it usually blinds those who are blinded
[1:26:09] to those things it makes them worse but
[1:26:12] in every generation God has always had
[1:26:16] his agents
[1:26:18] with an S One messenger to an age but
[1:26:21] many agents how many of you want to be
[1:26:24] one of his agents
[1:26:25] it's got down some time to merely one
[1:26:28] but God always had somebody in every
[1:26:31] generation that he could lay his finger
[1:26:33] on oh yes Lord some people that he could
[1:26:36] put his finger on and say this is my
[1:26:39] people and they'll do as I tell them to
[1:26:43] do oh father would you find some people
[1:26:46] in our midst that you could come down
[1:26:49] and put your finger on and know that
[1:26:52] they will do that we will do as you tell
[1:26:55] us to do
[1:26:57] isn't that what we're looking for
[1:27:04] let me make sure I didn't miss one
[1:27:15] I don't I don't remember if I did this
[1:27:17] adoption one I remember mentioning an
[1:27:19] option
[1:27:21] I don't remember if I did this adoption
[1:27:23] Tuesday night so let me do this before I
[1:27:25] move on to the subject for this morning
[1:27:27] this is from the message adoption number
[1:27:30] four
[1:27:31] paragraph 80
[1:27:33] brother random said go go right back to

[1:28:24] functioning in such a level in the
[1:28:26] Supernatural

[1:28:32] you just come up and look at your
[1:28:34] brother your sister you look at your
[1:28:35] your pastor you look at someone there

[1:28:41] Lord

[1:28:44] atmosphere that that Pastor or that
[1:28:46] brother would just turn around and say

[1:29:13] reigning In The Name Of The Lord
[1:29:20] wasn't one of those manifestations of
[1:29:22] the spoken word in brother branham's
[1:29:24] life and Ministry wasn't that control
[1:29:26] and authority over the elements of the
[1:29:29] Earth
[1:29:30] didn't he speak to that storm and didn't
[1:29:32] that storm have to obey
[1:29:34] then what about a bride on this scene
[1:29:37] that could say to that little brother
[1:29:38] I'll send you all the rain you need in
[1:29:40] the name of the Lord

[1:29:45] things not might
[1:29:47] can you believe that we will if we stay
[1:29:49] on the word

[1:29:55] groaning all nature waiting for the
[1:29:58] manifestation of the sons of God God
[1:30:00] ordained it at the beginning
[1:30:02] he gave man the domain
[1:30:05] don't you believe that God originally
[1:30:07] gave man the dominion over the Earth he
[1:30:10] gave it to Adam he gave it to Adam his
[1:30:13] son
[1:30:13] he gave Jesus Jesus Christ and Jesus
[1:30:16] gave it in his name with this assurance
[1:30:19] ask the father anything in my name and
[1:30:23] I'll do it over the Palmer waiting for
[1:30:25] the manifestation of the sons of God the
[1:30:28] position the church by that sounding
[1:30:32] good
[1:30:33] he said in the book of Ephesians is the
[1:30:36] Book of Joshua and Joshua placing the
[1:30:39] people where they belong now if they
[1:30:42] wouldn't stand still and he put Ephraim
[1:30:45] here and over on menace's land and this
[1:30:48] one would come back fussing and stewing
[1:30:50] how they ever going to get along isn't
[1:30:53] that a good question

[1:31:59] you said the sons and daughter God is
[1:32:01] wanting to place his church how are you
[1:32:03] going to do it stand still God is
[1:32:06] wanting to place his church the Sons and
[1:32:08] Daughters of God God let me live to see
[1:32:10] it as my prayer yes so close till I can
[1:32:13] just feel it with my hands almost look
[1:32:15] like it's right there
[1:32:18] that's what I've longed to see waiting
[1:32:20] for the time when walked down the street
[1:32:22] there lays a laying there from
[1:32:24] his mother's womb Silver and Gold Have I
[1:32:26] None oh waiting for the manifestations
[1:32:29] of the sons of God hallelujah listen
[1:32:31] this is the most successful healing
[1:32:33] minister of all time
[1:32:38] [Music]
[1:32:39] tens of thousands of people came from
[1:32:42] all over the world and received their
[1:32:44] healing and he's not satisfied
[1:32:49] he won't be satisfied as long as they're
[1:32:52] all coming to him for what they need
[1:32:55] he's looking for a day when the Bible
[1:32:58] talks about the Bible talks about Bible
[1:33:00] days here again the church moving like
[1:33:03] the Apostles of old he said oh waiting
[1:33:06] for the manifestations of the sons of
[1:33:08] God hallelujah when God shall make
[1:33:11] himself known when they'll stop sickness
[1:33:14] you're not listening
[1:33:16] when they'll stop sickness when they'll
[1:33:19] stop cancer
[1:33:21] they'll stop diseases
[1:33:25] I want you to listen carefully to
[1:33:27] paragraph 88 you think Cancer's
[1:33:28] something
[1:33:31] the Bible said there's coming a time
[1:33:33] when men will not will rot
[1:33:36] right in their flesh and the buzzards
[1:33:39] will eat off carcasses before they even
[1:33:41] die cancer is a toothache to what's
[1:33:43] coming
[1:33:44] if you read the book of the Revelation
[1:33:46] you'll find out that after the Rapture
[1:33:48] of the church there's such disease
[1:33:52] such hideous hideous judgments falling
[1:33:57] on planet Earth
[1:34:00] we better be so thankful so grateful
[1:34:06] realizing how blessed we are
[1:34:10] to have a ticket
[1:34:13] for the first trip out of here
[1:34:18] I want you to turn with me now to
[1:34:20] Ephesians chapter 6.
[1:34:25] beginning in verse 10 through 18.
[1:34:33] if we serve a supernatural God
[1:34:37] if we are a supernatural people
[1:34:42] and God has surely provided everything
[1:34:46] we need
[1:34:48] to fight the good fight of faith
[1:34:51] and he's certainly given us a
[1:34:53] supernatural armor
[1:34:55] to stand against The Wiles of the enemy
[1:34:57] and we're going to need it
[1:34:59] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:35:02] Lord and in the power of His might
[1:35:05] put on the
[1:35:08] put on the whole armor of God that you
[1:35:11] may be able to stand against The Wiles
[1:35:13] of the devil
[1:35:15] folks if God has given us various pieces
[1:35:18] of the armor we got to put it all on
[1:35:21] we can't go out to meet life with some
[1:35:24] of it missing
[1:35:25] we've got to make sure that we are fully
[1:35:27] dressed in the armor of God to be able
[1:35:30] to stand against The Wiles of the devil
[1:35:32] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:35:35] blood this is not a personality fight
[1:35:38] this is not a people conflict but
[1:35:41] against principalities against Powers
[1:35:43] against the rulers of the darkness of
[1:35:46] this world against spiritual wickedness
[1:35:49] and all right
[1:35:52] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:35:55] of God that ye may be able to withstand
[1:35:58] in the evil day and having done all
[1:36:03] and having done all
[1:36:06] having done all
[1:36:09] just stand
[1:36:11] and you can't do anything else you know
[1:36:13] what you can do
[1:36:14] you can stand
[1:36:17] we must
[1:36:19] stand therefore having your loins Girt
[1:36:23] about with truth
[1:36:25] having on the breastplate of
[1:36:28] righteousness which is his
[1:36:30] and your feet shod with the preparation
[1:36:34] of the gospel of peace
[1:36:36] above all taking the shield of faith
[1:36:40] wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
[1:36:44] the fiery darts of the wicked
[1:36:47] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[1:36:50] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[1:36:54] God how many of you think that sounds
[1:36:55] like a pretty good armor
[1:36:58] praying always with all prayer and
[1:37:01] supplication in the spirit and watching
[1:37:04] there unto with all perseverance and
[1:37:07] supplication for All Saints we're going
[1:37:10] to the message it wasn't so from the
[1:37:12] beginning
[1:37:14] paragraph 25
[1:37:17] now we find Our Lord then in his work
[1:37:21] that he claimed to do nothing of himself
[1:37:24] John 5 19 20 and verse 30. but what he
[1:37:29] seemed the father doing he gave all
[1:37:31] praise to God thing that was unnatural
[1:37:34] Supernatural every armor that we have
[1:37:38] brother
[1:37:39] all of our armor is what
[1:37:43] does it surprise you that a supernatural
[1:37:47] God would dress his Supernatural people
[1:37:50] in a supernatural armor
[1:37:52] [Music]
[1:37:54] be no surprise in that why would God
[1:37:57] give a supernatural people a natural
[1:37:59] armor
[1:38:01] when our battle is not a natural battle
[1:38:03] it's not a flesh and blood battle amen I
[1:38:07] said a moment ago it's not a battle of
[1:38:09] personalities it's not a battle of
[1:38:11] various cultures it's a spiritual battle
[1:38:14] in order to win a spiritual battle we
[1:38:17] have to use spiritual weapons in order
[1:38:20] to fight in a supernatural battle we
[1:38:23] have to have a supernatural armor I'm so
[1:38:25] glad that our armor is a supernatural
[1:38:28] armor nothing natural that we have he
[1:38:31] said we must believe it
[1:38:34] I want you to watch this next paragraph
[1:38:38] because these are not the kind of
[1:38:41] weapons
[1:38:42] that we are used to fighting with
[1:38:46] we usually fight with our words anybody
[1:38:48] here this morning
[1:38:53] I can't fight for you all night and then
[1:38:56] fight for you all day
[1:38:58] somebody's gonna have to do something
[1:39:01] we usually fight with our words
[1:39:04] and if our words don't do anything we we
[1:39:07] might even fight with our fist
[1:39:09] well don't look at me like you hadn't
[1:39:14] don't tell me you've never slapped
[1:39:16] somebody
[1:39:17] don't tell me you've never punched
[1:39:18] somebody
[1:39:19] most may not have but quite a few have
[1:39:24] [Music]
[1:39:25] let me see your hand if you're willing
[1:39:27] to admit you've you have
[1:39:29] oh that's the majority of us
[1:39:34] Josh did you hold up your hand
[1:39:36] you've never punched one of your
[1:39:38] brothers
[1:39:40] oh let me let me
[1:39:45] you'd make a good Philadelphia attorney
[1:39:49] that's what that sounded like
[1:39:52] you know they used to say I don't recall
[1:39:53] [Laughter]
[1:39:55] have you ever punched anybody have you
[1:39:58] ever slapped anybody you ever hit
[1:39:59] anybody ever knocked anybody down sister
[1:40:02] under view oh
[1:40:06] I think if we went around maybe it was
[1:40:09] our siblings our brothers our sisters
[1:40:11] our exes I don't know what it was
[1:40:15] but somewhere along the way we've let
[1:40:18] our anger get the best of us and we've
[1:40:20] tried to win a battle in the natural
[1:40:23] you'll never win a battle in the natural
[1:40:25] because even those natural what seem
[1:40:28] like natural battles when they have to
[1:40:30] do with your life
[1:40:32] they're bigger than natural
[1:40:33] there's some reason why the enemy is
[1:40:35] trying to get you entangled in this
[1:40:37] fight
[1:40:38] there's some reason why he's trying to
[1:40:40] distract you from your Spiritual armor
[1:40:43] here's how God wants us to fight in this
[1:40:46] hour he said what is the fruit of the
[1:40:48] spirit love
[1:40:50] Joy
[1:40:52] peace who's ever heard of winning a
[1:40:55] battle with peace
[1:41:00] who's ever heard of winning a battle
[1:41:02] with love
[1:41:06] who's ever heard of winning a battle
[1:41:08] with joy
[1:41:10] meekness
[1:41:12] gentleness patience
[1:41:15] he said now you go down to the drugstore
[1:41:17] and buy me a quarter's worth of patience
[1:41:19] I need it
[1:41:21] five dollars worth of love I could stand
[1:41:24] a lot of that see
[1:41:26] it's the Unseen something listen
[1:41:31] it's the Unseen something that's our
[1:41:34] whole armor
[1:41:36] if we're fighting a battle in an unseen
[1:41:38] Realm
[1:41:40] then our weapons may not be seen in the
[1:41:44] natural
[1:41:45] they may also be unseen
[1:41:48] but Supernatural
[1:41:51] he said that's our whole armor we stand
[1:41:54] in the Unseen World looking at the
[1:41:57] Unseen things yet to us we see them
[1:42:00] because our faith detects them and says
[1:42:04] it's there see
[1:42:11] I want you to know you are well equipped
[1:42:19] second Corinthians chapter four
[1:42:22] verse 8 in the Amplified Bible says this
[1:42:42] then what verse did I give you
[1:42:48] I gave you the wrong verse
[1:42:53] anybody here
[1:43:12] it's second Corinthians 4 18 not 4 8.
[1:43:18] sorry about that
[1:43:24] in the Amplified Bible
[1:43:27] second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 18.
[1:43:31] since we consider
[1:43:34] and look not to the things that are seen
[1:43:38] but to the things that are unseen
[1:43:41] for the things that are visible are
[1:43:43] temporal brief and fleeting but the
[1:43:46] things that are invisible are deathless
[1:43:50] and everlasting
[1:43:53] how many of you are thankful then that
[1:43:55] your weapons are are unseen
[1:43:59] we have to train ourselves where to look
[1:44:02] our flesh and nature will always turn to
[1:44:04] the Natural circumstances that surround
[1:44:07] us but we have another nature his spirit
[1:44:10] in us will often remind us and provoke
[1:44:15] us to look to the Unseen realm the other
[1:44:20] realm the reality of the supernatural
[1:44:23] unseen realm when the enemy tries to
[1:44:26] weight us down and discourage us and
[1:44:29] confuse us and defeat us we'll never get
[1:44:33] out of that place if we're looking at
[1:44:35] our natural circumstances it's only when
[1:44:38] we look away to Jesus isn't it it's only
[1:44:40] when we make a conscious decision okay I
[1:44:43] know what I see
[1:44:45] I know what it looks like I know what it
[1:44:48] smells like I know what it sounds like
[1:44:51] but I also know what God's word has said
[1:44:54] about it so I choose to ignore what I
[1:44:58] see in here and I choose to Anchor
[1:45:00] myself in what I cannot see in the
[1:45:04] natural but what my faith tells me is
[1:45:07] very much a reality
[1:45:09] in the message sir we would see Jesus
[1:45:13] brother random said in paragraph 45 and
[1:45:16] the whole Christian armor now is unseen
[1:45:23] the Christian looks at what he doesn't
[1:45:26] see natural
[1:45:27] now look that's the only way you can be
[1:45:30] a Christian you've got to believe God
[1:45:33] who you can't see
[1:45:36] see now look watch here the whole
[1:45:39] Christian armor is love
[1:45:43] Joy
[1:45:44] faith long-suffering
[1:45:48] patience meekness gentleness
[1:45:53] Holy Spirit
[1:45:56] see
[1:45:57] all those things are unseen they're
[1:46:00] unseen but the things that's unseen is
[1:46:04] the ones that has the reality the Unseen
[1:46:07] things if you and I would start fighting
[1:46:10] these battles that come with the Unseen
[1:46:13] realm with love with joy with faith with
[1:46:16] long suffering with patience with
[1:46:18] meekness with gentleness
[1:46:20] if we would allow the goodness of the
[1:46:22] Lord to overwhelm us and we start
[1:46:25] responding to to all the attack of the
[1:46:28] enemy with the armor that God has given
[1:46:30] us we can have the victory brother we
[1:46:32] can walk in the victory how many of you
[1:46:35] believe that
[1:46:36] calling Jesus on the scene
[1:46:38] uh 64 or paragraph 11 I like this first
[1:46:42] phrase he said you can't make yourself
[1:46:45] believe
[1:46:46] have you ever tried to
[1:46:49] you can't make yourself believe
[1:46:52] it's something it's a quality that's in
[1:46:55] you
[1:46:56] faith is the substance not just to make
[1:46:59] imaginary it is the substance of things
[1:47:01] hoped for the evidence of things that
[1:47:04] you believe and you don't see even when
[1:47:07] you don't see you believe and all the
[1:47:10] whole Christian armor now remember is by
[1:47:13] faith
[1:47:15] it's all Supernatural
[1:47:17] how are you going to fight with with
[1:47:19] faith and love and joy and peace and
[1:47:21] long-serving goodness me you're going to
[1:47:22] have to do it by faith
[1:47:24] you're not going to be able to take an
[1:47:26] inventory and say I don't think these
[1:47:28] things are in my life and therefore I'll
[1:47:30] just go down and utter defeat you're
[1:47:33] going to have to claim them by faith
[1:47:34] you're going to have to say if I have
[1:47:36] the Holy Spirit then the fruits of the
[1:47:38] Holy Spirit or somewhere in me
[1:47:40] the armor for the Unseen battle is
[1:47:43] somewhere in me I'm going to have to ask
[1:47:45] God to bring that to manifestation
[1:47:47] that's all unseen things that's the
[1:47:49] whole Christian armor the Christian
[1:47:51] always looks at things that he does not
[1:47:53] see because he's looking what
[1:47:56] that's right
[1:47:58] I had a promise
[1:47:59] not what's going on presently he keeps
[1:48:02] his eye on the promise
[1:48:04] he refuses to look on what the enemy you
[1:48:07] know he tries to howl and huff and puff
[1:48:11] and threat to blow the house down and
[1:48:13] all the things the enemy does because he
[1:48:15] wants to get your eyes off the promise
[1:48:17] he wants to get your eyes off the word
[1:48:20] and then in the message the Queen of
[1:48:22] Sheba
[1:48:24] paragraph 17
[1:48:27] brother random said that's the only way
[1:48:29] you can be saved is by faith
[1:48:31] the Bible said without faith it's
[1:48:33] impossible to please God
[1:48:35] you've got to look at the Unseen and a
[1:48:37] whole armor of Christianity is
[1:48:39] Supernatural
[1:48:42] the people
[1:48:44] how that a man can say that he believes
[1:48:46] in God and preaches in a church and says
[1:48:49] he does not believe in the Supernatural
[1:48:51] when the full armor of God the full
[1:48:53] armor of Christianity is what
[1:48:57] the full armor what is the armor of
[1:48:59] Christianity love joy peace
[1:49:03] long-suffering goodness meekness
[1:49:05] patience Faith did you know we can't
[1:49:08] make ourselves produce these things
[1:49:11] it's only by engaging with the Holy
[1:49:13] Spirit
[1:49:15] it's only by staying in touch with the
[1:49:17] holy spirit that we're able to produce
[1:49:19] any of these fruit we can't make
[1:49:21] ourselves do these things we just have
[1:49:23] to yield to the Holy Ghost that's in us
[1:49:25] that means we have to very much be in
[1:49:28] touch with who's walking around in our
[1:49:30] shoe leather
[1:49:31] he said what is love what is Joy go down
[1:49:34] to the drugstore and buy me a quarters
[1:49:35] worth of it I need it right now
[1:49:37] see you can't buy love
[1:49:40] joy peace long-suffering goodness
[1:49:42] patience gentleness Faith you can't buy
[1:49:44] it it's it's what
[1:49:46] tell me what it is
[1:49:49] and the whole armor of the Christian is
[1:49:51] what
[1:49:52] and we're bitten by the scriptures to
[1:49:55] put on the whole armor of God be girded
[1:49:57] about the whole armor did you know he's
[1:49:58] telling us to be dressed with the
[1:50:00] supernatural
[1:50:01] Gotta Have It
[1:50:03] you got to believe in it you got to
[1:50:05] believe for it before you can have it
[1:50:07] don't you let the enemy talk you out of
[1:50:10] the supernatural in your life
[1:50:12] in your life you've got to have it and
[1:50:15] then in a message demonology the
[1:50:16] Physical Realm paragraph 91 brother
[1:50:19] Brandon said the whole armor of God is
[1:50:21] what
[1:50:22] by faith
[1:50:24] how do you know you got it on by faith
[1:50:27] I mean you can go through the scripture
[1:50:29] I've done it before in prayer Lord I'm
[1:50:32] asking I'm putting on the helmet of
[1:50:33] South I'm putting on the
[1:50:36] Lord right now I'm asking you to give me
[1:50:38] the shield of faith
[1:50:39] Lord I'm asking you to let my feet be
[1:50:41] shot with the preparation of the gospel
[1:50:43] of peace Lord I'm asking you to place
[1:50:45] the sword of the spirit in my hand I've
[1:50:47] prayed through the armor many many many
[1:50:49] many times but how do I know he did it
[1:50:50] how do I know it's there I have to
[1:50:52] believe it by faith he said it was my
[1:50:55] armor I give you the this is the
[1:50:57] believer's armor I'm giving you the
[1:50:59] whole armor of God and it's by faith we
[1:51:01] haven't got one natural thing of this
[1:51:03] world everything a Christian Church is a
[1:51:05] faith act look at the armor of God love
[1:51:07] joy peace long-suffering goodness
[1:51:09] meekness gentleness patience is that
[1:51:10] right everything what
[1:51:14] everything's Supernatural nothing
[1:51:18] natural
[1:51:22] so we don't look at the things natural
[1:51:28] the bill that is not being paid
[1:51:35] the symptoms of the physical infirmity
[1:51:40] the confusion in the family
[1:51:47] we don't look at the things natural
[1:51:48] because we're not operating there
[1:51:51] the little bride of Christ is to be
[1:51:53] operating where
[1:51:55] in the Supernatural how does she do it
[1:51:56] by faith
[1:51:59] by faith by faith how do we operate in
[1:52:03] the things that are Supernatural by
[1:52:06] faith and the only way we can base it is
[1:52:08] Faith is on what God Said was the truth
[1:52:10] and we look at the Unseen we look at the
[1:52:13] Unseen we purposefully
[1:52:15] consciously choose again and again and
[1:52:19] again and again and again to look at the
[1:52:22] Unseen and here's what we must do even
[1:52:24] like Abraham call those things which are
[1:52:29] not as though they were
[1:52:35] my family is seeing
[1:52:39] you
[1:52:40] my family is sealed
[1:52:44] the Battle Is Over
[1:52:47] Victorious one it's already done
[1:52:53] come on
[1:52:57] you just don't know how mean they've
[1:52:58] been this week my family is sick
[1:53:07] they didn't like one of my pictures on
[1:53:11] Facebook this week
[1:53:16] I'm really being persecuted
[1:53:21] my family is really persecuting me they
[1:53:24] didn't like any of my pictures on
[1:53:26] Facebook this week my family is sealed
[1:53:35] you know we get aggravated at people
[1:53:37] sometime I get aggravated with some of
[1:53:39] you at times
[1:53:41] I'm gonna give you an example it's going
[1:53:43] to be a little personal are you ready
[1:53:50] let me just take a little water
[1:53:53] I don't need more courage but I do need
[1:53:55] a little hydration
[1:53:59] I want to see how I'm going to say this
[1:54:06] we love details
[1:54:08] I'm a detail driven person
[1:54:11] I like details some folks in this church
[1:54:13] don't like details
[1:54:16] they live in the general areas of life
[1:54:19] nothing specific
[1:54:23] you're waiting for me explain I know I
[1:54:25] know I know
[1:54:28] so by the time you get the prayer
[1:54:31] request
[1:54:32] you don't get many details with it
[1:54:34] from some folks some folks give you way
[1:54:37] more details than you need
[1:54:41] when he went out of here he had on blue
[1:54:43] socks and Tennis Shoes
[1:54:47] now how many of you know you don't need
[1:54:48] to know that to pray for him
[1:54:51] come on
[1:54:52] and then you've got the other ones
[1:54:54] that'll just say he needs prayer
[1:55:01] well we all do
[1:55:03] and sometimes we'll come back around and
[1:55:05] check with some of them that said he
[1:55:06] needs prayer well how's he doing I don't
[1:55:08] know
[1:55:11] these folks are not very detail driven
[1:55:14] I don't know how he is I ain't heard
[1:55:16] from him don't know couldn't tell you
[1:55:19] and you want to say didn't you ask me to
[1:55:21] pray for him
[1:55:23] I'm saying him to help throw off the
[1:55:25] scent
[1:55:32] trying to find
[1:55:40] well I don't know hadn't heard from him
[1:55:42] in a while
[1:55:44] so what am I supposed to do somebody
[1:55:45] tell me what am I supposed to do am I
[1:55:47] supposed to keep praying
[1:55:51] or am I supposed to wait for you to tell
[1:55:53] me he needs prayer again
[1:55:57] follow me just a minute I know this is
[1:55:58] getting a little long because I'm having
[1:56:00] so much fun
[1:56:04] there's a fine line
[1:56:07] sometimes we would like a checkup
[1:56:10] come on give me a little checkup is
[1:56:13] anything changed
[1:56:15] is anything any better
[1:56:18] it's all the news bad
[1:56:20] has there been any good news
[1:56:23] and sometimes people live such a close
[1:56:27] private life they don't want they want
[1:56:29] you to do all the praying
[1:56:31] but they don't even want you to even
[1:56:33] know what you're praying about so you
[1:56:34] better have the Holy Ghost
[1:56:37] and sometimes listen and that's very
[1:56:40] frustrating but sometimes someone has
[1:56:45] had to make a conscious decision
[1:56:48] I can't live in the details
[1:56:55] I can't live in what I see what I hear
[1:56:59] or what I know
[1:57:01] I can't live by the pictures I see
[1:57:05] are the reports that I get I've got to
[1:57:08] live in the Unseen
[1:57:10] and then the Unseen he's already
[1:57:13] CEO see
[1:57:17] so sometimes we're very frustrated when
[1:57:19] we don't get to know all of what's going
[1:57:21] on but we also must remember that some
[1:57:24] people have chosen in life
[1:57:28] yeah
[1:57:29] to to say wait a minute I can't live
[1:57:32] from the day-to-day reports of it's
[1:57:35] worse today than it was yesterday
[1:57:42] he's gone from beer to Jack Daniels
[1:57:48] you don't need that detail
[1:57:52] you you don't need the detail you you
[1:57:54] don't need to know what pill he's
[1:57:56] changed for what pill
[1:57:58] what what addiction he's traded for
[1:58:00] another addiction what you need to know
[1:58:02] is your answer doesn't come from the
[1:58:05] scene world
[1:58:06] your answers coming from The Unseen
[1:58:09] Hallelujah
[1:58:11] your faith is not going to be anointed
[1:58:14] if you're only looking to what you can
[1:58:17] see and what you can hear but if you
[1:58:19] make a decision my family is
[1:58:23] sealed come on
[1:58:26] my body is healed
[1:58:32] we're not living until the doctor's
[1:58:35] report we're living by the faith in the
[1:58:38] son of the resurrected Lamb of God and
[1:58:41] we know that he is able
[1:58:47] the only way we so so we don't look at
[1:58:49] the things natural because we're
[1:58:51] operating Supernatural and the only way
[1:58:53] we can base it is faith
[1:58:55] faith is on what God Said was the truth
[1:58:59] we look at the Unseen God said he's all
[1:59:02] right
[1:59:03] God says she's going to be all right
[1:59:05] God said if you put your trust in me
[1:59:08] everything's going to be all right
[1:59:09] because I'm moving
[1:59:12] he's moving
[1:59:14] even when we don't see him even when we
[1:59:16] don't feel him he's moving come on like
[1:59:19] brother Joss sung he's turning it around
[1:59:21] we don't see the turnaround yet but
[1:59:23] we're not looking to what we see we're
[1:59:25] looking to what we cannot see because
[1:59:27] that's where the promise is and so
[1:59:29] sometimes we have to call those things
[1:59:33] which are not as though they were
[1:59:42] if you're doing that without faith
[1:59:44] you're telling a lie
[1:59:46] you're just lying
[1:59:48] but if you're doing that with faith
[1:59:50] you're doing exactly what God given has
[1:59:52] given you the privilege to do call those
[1:59:55] things that are not as though they are
[2:00:04] she's going to be okay
[2:00:06] why because I'm calling those things
[2:00:09] that have not yet manifested into
[2:00:11] existence
[2:00:15] God's got the job
[2:00:18] so I'm not looking at the lack thereof
[2:00:19] I'm looking at the promise
[2:00:24] never seen the righteous forsaken or
[2:00:26] God's seed begging for bread how many of
[2:00:28] you appreciate this verse Abraham
[2:00:31] he did it he guided amen Abraham called
[2:00:33] those things which was not like God did
[2:00:36] as though they were being a hundred
[2:00:38] years old he staggered not at the
[2:00:40] promise of God through unbelief may God
[2:00:42] give us the strength that we need not to
[2:00:45] stagger
[2:00:47] at the promise of God
[2:00:49] through unbelief
[2:00:52] now are you too tired to hear a little
[2:00:54] more
[2:00:55] you sure
[2:01:00] in a message called only believe
[2:01:04] paragraph four use our armor
[2:01:07] we got an armor
[2:01:09] God works with us and gives us the armor
[2:01:13] and the whole armor is on the
[2:01:15] supernatural see
[2:01:17] love joy peace long-suffering goodness
[2:01:20] meekness gentleness patience is all in
[2:01:24] the Supernatural
[2:01:27] if I should ask you do you have love joy
[2:01:29] peace long-suffering goodness meeting at
[2:01:31] gentleman's patience
[2:01:32] you'd say well I
[2:01:34] on a good day I do
[2:01:36] but I don't have many good days
[2:01:39] see you're looking at what you think
[2:01:43] what you've perceived you're not looking
[2:01:45] at the supernatural you're looking at it
[2:01:47] a very natural way well I don't seem to
[2:01:49] have enough love I don't seem to have
[2:01:51] enough Joy I don't seem to have enough
[2:01:52] peace but this is Supernatural by faith
[2:01:55] there's no way to measure this it's all
[2:01:57] in him
[2:01:59] so the reality is yes I have love joy
[2:02:02] peace long-suffering goodness meekness
[2:02:03] gentleness patience all these
[2:02:05] Supernatural things are working in me
[2:02:07] because I have the Holy Ghost the real
[2:02:09] question is do you have the Holy Ghost
[2:02:11] if you have the Holy Ghost love joy
[2:02:13] peace long-serving goodness beings it's
[2:02:15] there
[2:02:17] because the Holy Ghost is there it's all
[2:02:19] in the Supernatural even when you don't
[2:02:21] see it even when you don't feel it even
[2:02:23] when it's not manifesting to the measure
[2:02:25] that you would desire it doesn't mean
[2:02:27] that it's not there
[2:02:29] now remember he goes on
[2:02:32] and if you let your faith loose to God's
[2:02:36] spirit
[2:02:38] it brings your body in subjection to
[2:02:40] God's Redemptive blessing to you
[2:02:43] I think you should hear that and pay a
[2:02:44] little attention to that
[2:02:46] if you let your faith loose
[2:02:48] if you turn your faith loose toward
[2:02:51] God's spirit
[2:02:52] that brings your body in subjection to
[2:02:55] God's Redemptive blessing for your life
[2:02:58] and anything that Jesus died for he's
[2:03:01] sitting at the right hand of the father
[2:03:02] tonight
[2:03:04] that's figurative
[2:03:10] figurative
[2:03:12] that's the right hand of power and
[2:03:13] authority
[2:03:15] that's the figurative language of the
[2:03:16] Bible just like when he said he sent the
[2:03:18] angels to the four corners of the Earth
[2:03:23] it's figurative biblical language
[2:03:26] don't let that throw you up
[2:03:29] the Bible's full of that kind of poetic
[2:03:31] language
[2:03:33] all right
[2:03:34] let your faith loose to God's spirit it
[2:03:37] brings your body in subjection to God's
[2:03:38] redempted blessing to you and anything
[2:03:40] that Jesus died for he's sitting at the
[2:03:43] right hand of the father tonight making
[2:03:44] intercessions
[2:03:46] [Music]
[2:03:48] upon your confession
[2:03:50] well I don't have no faith
[2:03:52] I don't have no love I don't have enough
[2:03:55] Joy I don't have enough long-suffering I
[2:03:57] don't have enough goodness
[2:03:59] what could he say
[2:04:01] what could he say
[2:04:04] if he's making intercession only on your
[2:04:06] confession he'd have to repeat before
[2:04:08] the father what you say
[2:04:12] well he said he didn't have any love not
[2:04:14] enough love he said he didn't have any
[2:04:16] joy that do you think that's going to
[2:04:18] get anything done
[2:04:19] no no that's not the way it worked if
[2:04:21] your confession is this I'm filled with
[2:04:23] the Holy Ghost
[2:04:25] and therefore every Redemptive blessing
[2:04:27] of God is mine and any place where I
[2:04:30] have been short in the past in
[2:04:32] manifesting the Supernatural Armor of
[2:04:34] God I confess I decree I declare in the
[2:04:37] mighty name of Jesus that I will be
[2:04:40] filled and protected with love with joy
[2:04:43] with peace with long suffering with
[2:04:45] meekness with goodness with gentleness
[2:04:47] because that is my inheritance
[2:04:52] thank you
[2:04:54] and then figuratively our Lord is
[2:04:56] confessing out over the heavenlies do
[2:04:58] you hear that
[2:05:00] he's filled with love he's filled with
[2:05:02] joy he's filled with peace
[2:05:05] and the angels say then let me go and
[2:05:07] minister to him and let me go minister
[2:05:09] to her and let me do what I can to help
[2:05:11] make sure that they're walking in the
[2:05:13] promise that they're confessing
[2:05:15] you believe it works that way I do I
[2:05:17] really do I actually do
[2:05:19] all right let's go on
[2:05:21] whatever you confess that he's done and
[2:05:23] believe
[2:05:24] it's your personal property
[2:05:26] every believer every person that's born
[2:05:28] again has the right to any of the
[2:05:30] Redemptive blessings when you get saved
[2:05:33] Jesus just takes and hands you a
[2:05:34] checkbook
[2:05:35] to last you all through life's journey
[2:05:38] and his name signed at the bottom of
[2:05:40] every one of them
[2:05:41] oh my my my my
[2:05:43] whatever you have need of you ask the
[2:05:45] father in my name it'll be done just
[2:05:47] sign a check and send it up there are
[2:05:48] you afraid to sign one tonight no fill
[2:05:50] her out send it up it's recognized yes
[2:05:53] sir it's recognized he'll certainly
[2:05:55] bring it to pass this is Supernatural
[2:05:59] now part of our Supernatural armor are
[2:06:02] those fruits of the spirit
[2:06:05] but the greatest weapon that we've been
[2:06:07] given in the Supernatural to fight the
[2:06:09] supernatural battle
[2:06:10] by a supernatural God as a supernatural
[2:06:13] people is the word
[2:06:16] I want you to look at these just with me
[2:06:17] just a few minutes the conflict between
[2:06:19] God and Satan 1962 paragraph 58 this is
[2:06:22] powerful stuff right here he said God
[2:06:25] knew this great Warfare was coming on
[2:06:27] between right and wrong
[2:06:28] and he knew what the enemy was going to
[2:06:30] do he know just exactly how to equip his
[2:06:33] people
[2:06:34] oh my goodness the devil could never get
[2:06:37] ahead of God
[2:06:39] he could never plan a war that God
[2:06:40] didn't know anything about he knew every
[2:06:42] detail
[2:06:43] so so God knowing what the devil was
[2:06:46] going to do God knowing what the enemy
[2:06:48] was going to do he provided everything
[2:06:49] you and I need to defeat him on every on
[2:06:51] every level on every plane
[2:06:54] God knew this great Warfare was coming
[2:06:55] on between right and wrong and he knew
[2:06:57] what the enemy was going to do he know
[2:06:59] just exactly how to equip God's people
[2:07:01] so if we notice the very first thing
[2:07:03] that God equipped his children was
[2:07:06] being infinite he knowed what it took to
[2:07:09] defeat Satan Anytime Anyplace anywhere
[2:07:12] on any condition
[2:07:15] I'm going to say that again I didn't get
[2:07:17] enough
[2:07:18] he knowed what it took to defeat Satan
[2:07:21] any time any place anywhere on any
[2:07:23] condition
[2:07:24] now he wouldn't say I'll give him
[2:07:26] something here in a few years later I
[2:07:27] may study out something better to give
[2:07:29] them and then after a few years later
[2:07:31] like we in the military force the old
[2:07:34] bow and Aaron Sledge rock hammer the
[2:07:36] next was after bow and aracoma musket
[2:07:38] and after a musket of Springfield and
[2:07:40] now the atomic weapon and things he kept
[2:07:42] growing more
[2:07:43] but God at the beginning gave his
[2:07:46] children the atomic weapon
[2:07:48] because he's the infinite God
[2:07:50] now seeing there was going to be a
[2:07:52] conflict and there was going to be a
[2:07:53] battle listen God equipped his children
[2:07:56] with the right kind of ammunition the
[2:07:58] right kind of an attack the right kind
[2:08:00] of everything that they had need of that
[2:08:02] would sweep them all the way from Eden
[2:08:08] to the rapture
[2:08:10] it's been provided for us
[2:08:14] to get us all the way from Eden to the
[2:08:17] rapture
[2:08:18] if you believe that's amen what was it
[2:08:22] huh
[2:08:27] that's what defeats Satan
[2:08:30] it's the word it'll defeat him anywhere
[2:08:32] any place now why do we want to
[2:08:35] substitute something else when we've
[2:08:37] already got the best thing there is the
[2:08:39] word you want to win a supernatural
[2:08:41] battle use your Supernatural weapons the
[2:08:43] word
[2:08:45] we find Jesus on Earth just to prove
[2:08:47] that was the best equipment when Satan
[2:08:48] come in hand-to-hand combat with Jesus
[2:08:50] can you imagine
[2:08:51] brother Branham is saying that Satan
[2:08:53] came in hand-to-hand combat with Jesus
[2:08:56] he never just reached over with his
[2:08:58] power and tied his hands
[2:09:01] he just took the same weapon that God
[2:09:03] gave in the Garden of Eden his word
[2:09:07] look at what Jesus said it's written
[2:09:08] it's written and he punched him right
[2:09:10] out of the ring with it
[2:09:13] that's right because it's God's best the
[2:09:15] word is God's best paragraph 62 and look
[2:09:18] where it is it's not just one or two in
[2:09:19] a church it's for every one of us
[2:09:23] every believer has a right to take his
[2:09:26] word and fight the enemy anywhere you
[2:09:28] meet him anywhere you meet the enemy
[2:09:31] this word is what you have to use and
[2:09:33] Jesus proved it when he come oh
[2:09:36] Hallelujah so he equipped his children
[2:09:38] with the word for their protection
[2:09:40] against the enemy when the all-out
[2:09:42] Warfare comes at the battles and set in
[2:09:44] a ray there's only one thing a real
[2:09:46] Soldier can use a real Christian Soldier
[2:09:50] [Music]
[2:09:51] that's thus saith the Lord
[2:09:57] powerful word
[2:09:59] that's our weapon right there that's all
[2:10:01] we need
[2:10:02] it's thus say of the Lord walk right out
[2:10:05] there and meet the enemy with the
[2:10:06] assurance that nothing
[2:10:08] thousand may fall at your right in ten
[2:10:11] thousands at the left but will come
[2:10:13] neither just remember that God made this
[2:10:15] statement and gave this to his children
[2:10:16] and it's the best thing that's ever been
[2:10:18] yet
[2:10:19] Satan and Eden when he first come to
[2:10:21] these attacks to attack a person knowing
[2:10:23] the children of God was fortified with
[2:10:25] the word with this word Satan attacked
[2:10:28] the word
[2:10:29] see he never attacked the being
[2:10:32] he attacked the word first
[2:10:35] oh yes
[2:10:38] you can't believe that Branham guy
[2:10:44] you see if the enemy can move you off
[2:10:46] the word because that's what the word is
[2:10:49] that's what we've got we've got the word
[2:10:50] of God it's right here for us we carried
[2:10:52] under our arm we better be carrying it
[2:10:54] in our heart
[2:10:55] and we couldn't always understand what
[2:10:57] we read and so God kept his promise and
[2:10:59] he gave us an understanding of that word
[2:11:01] by Revelation and he did what he always
[2:11:03] did throughout the scripture he used a
[2:11:05] prophet to help us understand that word
[2:11:06] don't let that throw you off that was
[2:11:09] always God's plan
[2:11:11] that was his plan from the beginning
[2:11:13] the first prophets in the Book of
[2:11:15] Genesis
[2:11:17] it goes all the way through the Bible it
[2:11:19] was always God's way it was always God's
[2:11:22] plan
[2:11:23] but see if the enemy can can discredit
[2:11:25] brother Branham in your mind he'll cause
[2:11:27] you to doubt the word you believed
[2:11:30] you'll take everything brother bam said
[2:11:32] and you'll start questioning that
[2:11:35] that's how somebody could leave a church
[2:11:36] like this and go back to a trinitarian
[2:11:38] church
[2:11:41] because once you start discrediting a
[2:11:43] man you'll start taking everything he
[2:11:45] ever said apart
[2:11:47] and you'll be getting father and father
[2:11:49] and father away from the word every
[2:11:52] chance every time just further and
[2:11:54] further away and the enemy just bold
[2:11:56] mind what a what a what a joy what what
[2:11:58] a real celebration it is for him because
[2:12:01] the only thing that God has given you to
[2:12:03] defeat him you're getting further and
[2:12:05] further away from that because you're
[2:12:06] letting the enemy discredit that in your
[2:12:09] own heart and mind so you won't use that
[2:12:11] against him you ought to take this word
[2:12:12] and use it
[2:12:14] you ought to take this word and defeat
[2:12:16] the enemy because according to this
[2:12:17] message it'll work anytime anywhere
[2:12:20] under any circumstance wherever you meet
[2:12:22] the devil all you got to do is pull the
[2:12:24] word out and whip the tar out of him
[2:12:28] I agree he may not respond to you but he
[2:12:32] will respond to the word he has no
[2:12:35] choice you anybody believe that he
[2:12:38] attacked the word first and then in the
[2:12:39] greatest battle ever fought I think I'll
[2:12:41] do one more I'm very tired and I think
[2:12:43] you are too
[2:12:45] uh in the in the in paragraph 149 of the
[2:12:48] greatest battle ever fought he said the
[2:12:51] great hour of charge is at hand
[2:12:52] Hallelujah soldier with armors gleaming
[2:12:54] color streaming
[2:12:56] faith and doubt is setting yourself in a
[2:12:59] ray in this Tabernacle this morning
[2:13:01] doubt on one side faith on the other
[2:13:03] this is where we are
[2:13:05] this is where we are sold your standards
[2:13:07] your post of Duty hallelujah our captain
[2:13:09] the Morning Star leads on
[2:13:12] he never goes back
[2:13:14] he never don't know the word retreat he
[2:13:17] don't have to retreat a man certainly
[2:13:20] the greatest battle ever fought she is
[2:13:23] going on right in here now yes sir
[2:13:28] between life and death between sickness
[2:13:31] and health between faith and doubt oh my
[2:13:36] between
[2:13:37] everybody
[2:13:42] the Battle Zone Shine Your spear
[2:13:45] soldiers polish up the armor God is
[2:13:49] getting his soldiers ready amen God
[2:13:52] anoints his army
[2:13:56] America dresses their soldiers in the
[2:13:58] best that they can have to dress with
[2:14:00] steel helmets and armors and whatever
[2:14:02] they got armor tanks whatever they go in
[2:14:04] god dresses his army hallelujah what
[2:14:07] kind of equipment do we use the spirit
[2:14:09] of the sword the word of God Amen
[2:14:14] it's the best there is the word of God
[2:14:16] is sharper than a two-edged sword
[2:14:18] Hebrews 4 Pearson even the son of the
[2:14:21] bone even the mayor of the bone even a
[2:14:22] discerner the thoughts of the Mind the
[2:14:24] word of God to believe his word and
[2:14:26] that's the way God armors
[2:14:29] that's what he gave to Eve to arm
[2:14:31] herself with she broke her armor down
[2:14:33] how'd she do it by opening up her mind
[2:14:43] to reason
[2:14:48] now does a sister really have to wear a
[2:14:51] skirt
[2:14:52] in a dress
[2:14:54] all the time
[2:15:00] the Bible just said long hair it didn't
[2:15:02] say you couldn't trim it and
[2:15:04] so is it really wrong for a woman to put
[2:15:07] the scissors to her hair
[2:15:13] that's how the enemy works
[2:15:18] is it really wrong for you to follow
[2:15:20] that
[2:15:21] trail of pornography after all it's
[2:15:24] no one else is involved
[2:15:28] it's just your sin
[2:15:31] just you wouldn't that be much better
[2:15:33] than you going out and getting another
[2:15:35] woman somewhere and causing such pain
[2:15:37] and heartache
[2:15:39] see how the enemy works
[2:15:43] I I don't want to just stay on the
[2:15:45] sisters but I I saw that so many years
[2:15:48] ago the enemy would come to a sister
[2:15:50] start talking to her well you know if
[2:15:52] you really want to be able to deal with
[2:15:54] it you just get it permed and then you
[2:15:56] won't have to deal with it as much
[2:15:57] because it'll
[2:15:59] it'll it'll tighten it up and
[2:16:02] shorten it up and you'll be able to do
[2:16:03] something with it and the next thing you
[2:16:04] know
[2:16:06] it's so chemically burned until it's all
[2:16:08] fallen off and falling out and
[2:16:11] anybody listening to me
[2:16:14] that that is that's power on your head
[2:16:17] you be careful what you do with that
[2:16:20] because that represents power and
[2:16:23] authority on your head
[2:16:27] and brother sister when you go to pray
[2:16:29] you need all that power and authority
[2:16:31] that you can have
[2:16:33] and it's a it's an outward don't you let
[2:16:35] the enemy start talking to you
[2:16:40] reasoning away those things as though
[2:16:43] they don't matter they matter
[2:16:46] um don't you let the enemy say well I'll
[2:16:49] go to the theater with my pastor to see
[2:16:51] the chosen but next week I saw a good
[2:16:54] advertisement there and and it may be
[2:16:56] are but it probably won't be too bad so
[2:16:59] I'll just go and sit down in front of
[2:17:00] that
[2:17:02] come on
[2:17:05] well I noticed someone else had this and
[2:17:08] I noticed someone else was doing this
[2:17:10] and I know so the enemy
[2:17:13] is so slick and so sly
[2:17:16] that he will come and try to get you to
[2:17:18] reason with your own faith
[2:17:21] you set out never ever to open up your
[2:17:24] life for compromise but the next thing
[2:17:25] you know you've fallen off that slippery
[2:17:28] slope
[2:17:33] very very very careful because once you
[2:17:36] get down that slippery slope and away
[2:17:38] from the word I'm telling you you're
[2:17:40] losing the very weapon that you have to
[2:17:41] win the supernatural fight that's what
[2:17:44] he gave Eve to arm herself with she
[2:17:46] broke her armor down how'd she do it by
[2:17:47] opening up her mind to reason you didn't
[2:17:50] reason you don't reason with God's word
[2:17:52] it has no reason
[2:17:57] God didn't have to offer us a reason
[2:18:01] for what his word says
[2:18:03] we just say amen and do it
[2:18:06] we don't have to have an explanation I
[2:18:08] hope somebody's listening to me
[2:18:10] we don't have to have an explanation
[2:18:12] there's no reasoning in God's word
[2:18:14] there's not no doubt about it there's no
[2:18:16] reasoning to it it's God's word that
[2:18:18] settles it
[2:18:19] in fact that settles it
[2:18:23] forever
[2:18:26] I said we were going to close by and
[2:18:28] read one last one while the musicians
[2:18:30] are coming
[2:18:31] it's quite early
[2:18:33] somebody say it's quite early
[2:18:41] I'm going to putting on the whole armor
[2:18:43] of God
[2:18:48] I want to tell you something else that
[2:18:50] God has given us
[2:18:51] to help fortify the army
[2:18:55] we found out that his word is our
[2:18:58] greatest weapon
[2:19:00] and that he has dressed Us in the armor
[2:19:02] of these great fruits of the Holy Spirit
[2:19:05] but God's given us something else
[2:19:08] and we better understand that we need
[2:19:10] this
[2:19:11] it's way more than press play and obey
[2:19:16] we need a live Ministry
[2:19:19] first of all we need a living example we
[2:19:22] need somebody who can teach us how to
[2:19:24] praise we need somebody who can lead us
[2:19:27] in prayer
[2:19:29] we need somebody who can show us how to
[2:19:31] respond to the word
[2:19:33] paragraph 76 now God fortified his army
[2:19:37] what with himself
[2:19:40] I tell you you can't get any greater
[2:19:43] fortification than God fortifying his
[2:19:47] own Army
[2:19:49] so God has fortified his army himself
[2:19:53] and how has he done that in the form of
[2:19:57] prophets Apostles teachers
[2:20:01] pastors
[2:20:02] all plural
[2:20:05] all plural
[2:20:07] we need that
[2:20:09] five-fold Ministry
[2:20:12] what did he do what was God doing listen
[2:20:14] did you ever think what that offices of
[2:20:17] the church is
[2:20:20] God's dress in inside dress
[2:20:25] an apostle a prophet a seer
[2:20:30] 4C
[2:20:32] before Satan ever gets to it
[2:20:35] Dunn told it
[2:20:39] uh
[2:20:41] what is it
[2:20:43] God dressed up in his church
[2:20:50] we have had the last messenger
[2:20:54] but we have not had the last prophet or
[2:20:57] the last Apostle or the last Pastor or
[2:21:01] the last teacher or the last evangelist
[2:21:06] we know exactly how long they'll be with
[2:21:08] us
[2:21:09] because Ephesians tells us until
[2:21:12] right we all come to the unity of the
[2:21:15] faith
[2:21:15] he said these office
[2:21:24] God's dress wear God's presence
[2:21:29] God's spirit
[2:21:31] working through
[2:21:34] man
[2:21:41] a woman have a beautiful role
[2:21:44] in the body of Christ
[2:21:47] to have gifts and to operate in those
[2:21:50] gifts
[2:21:51] but not to serve in that fivefold
[2:21:54] Ministry
[2:21:56] that's not their place
[2:21:59] this is God's spirit his presence
[2:22:01] working through man and if that office
[2:22:04] listen and if that office denies any of
[2:22:07] this word so for instance if you've got
[2:22:09] a pastor
[2:22:11] who denies any of this word
[2:22:14] and he's disqualifying himself as being
[2:22:17] a part of God's dress wear
[2:22:21] oh wow and if that office denies any of
[2:22:24] this word then it's not God dressing no
[2:22:26] not that that's the wolf in sheep's
[2:22:29] clothing watch that fellow beware of him
[2:22:33] and that's me
[2:22:35] or anybody else
[2:22:38] it is your responsibility to make sure
[2:22:41] that I do not deny the word
[2:22:46] if I get off that word it's your
[2:22:49] responsibility to pray me back on that
[2:22:52] word
[2:22:53] not your responsibility to write emails
[2:22:56] about me post articles about me publicly
[2:22:59] rebuke me
[2:23:01] but it's your responsibility to warn me
[2:23:04] to pray for me
[2:23:06] to help me
[2:23:08] because if I fall away from being a part
[2:23:11] of God's dress wear
[2:23:14] then you're left without that
[2:23:16] representation of God in your midst
[2:23:18] so we've got to pray for our leaders our
[2:23:21] pastors our ministers and we have young
[2:23:24] men Among Us who have said to me they
[2:23:26] feel the call of God on their life to
[2:23:29] minister the gospel and we want to make
[2:23:31] room for them
[2:23:33] In God's Time
[2:23:36] because he doesn't just use the tape
[2:23:39] player
[2:23:40] or the computer
[2:23:42] or the MP3 or the Chip he's ordained
[2:23:47] this five-fold ministry as part of the
[2:23:49] way that the Church of Jesus Christ is
[2:23:52] fortified against the enemy
[2:23:54] that fivefold Ministry must stay on the
[2:23:58] word if he Strays from that word then
[2:24:02] we've got big problems that need to be
[2:24:04] dealt with if you believe that say Amen
[2:24:08] so not only do we serve a supernatural
[2:24:10] God we're a supernatural people
[2:24:13] and not only are we a supernatural
[2:24:15] people but God has given us everything
[2:24:18] we need supernaturally to win this
[2:24:21] battle
[2:24:22] there is a secret Rapture coming for the
[2:24:25] supernatural bride of Jesus Christ we
[2:24:28] have the gifts of the Spirit that are
[2:24:31] given to us as armor
[2:24:35] you meet the enemy with love and joy and
[2:24:38] peace and
[2:24:39] come on
[2:24:41] brother random tells us how devils are
[2:24:44] cast out
[2:24:45] they're not cast out in anger
[2:24:47] [Music]
[2:24:49] devils are cast out in love
[2:24:54] that's how the enemy is defeated
[2:24:56] it's by that armor that God has given us
[2:24:59] thank you Jesus for it he's given us his
[2:25:02] word which is the greatest weapon that
[2:25:03] anybody can have against the enemy and
[2:25:06] then thankfully God has also given us a
[2:25:08] five-fold Ministry to help prepare us
[2:25:11] to help protect us to help keep us in
[2:25:14] the faith because we are a supernatural
[2:25:17] people let's Stand Together
[2:25:19] you'll have to Pardon Me

[2:26:05] to come right where you are and meet
