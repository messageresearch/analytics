[0:06] Jesus received a change of clothes
[0:12] just like the priest just like Adam and
[0:16] Eve just like the children of Israel
[0:19] Jesus had a change of clothes he laid
[0:23] aside his royal robe of deity he laid
[0:29] aside his kingly robe he laid aside the
[0:34] glory here's what is very important to
[0:37] remember he laid aside the glory that he
[0:42] had shared with the father from before
[0:49] the beginning of the world the Bible
[0:52] tells us he laid all of that aside and
[0:56] he took on another set of clothes he
[1:00] stepped in to a set of clothes that was
[1:03] of this world come on he conducted
[1:08] himself no longer as the king of all
[1:11] kings but now he moved as a servant I
[1:17] believe that it was not just the glory
[1:20] that he emptied as he moved in his
[1:24] earthly ministry but I believe at the
[1:26] cross he gave up much of the rights much
[1:30] of the authority that he had had as the
[1:33] Word made flesh and I believe that he
[1:36] died as a man I believe that it was
[1:41] absolutely necessary I believe that him
[1:44] that that father that eternal spirit of
[1:47] the Father that was with him was with
[1:49] him all the way
[1:50] Crouse even though we had already laid
[1:53] aside much of the glory that he had had
[1:55] with the father in the beginning but
[1:58] still the deity was there the very
[2:00] eternal spirit of the father was in him
[2:02] and there on the cross god can't die he
[2:07] couldn't die as a god how many of you
[2:09] understand that he could only die as
[2:11] someone who can die a man can die but
[2:14] God can't die and so the spirit of the
[2:17] Father I believe it was as though I
[2:19] almost ripped from him and he felt it
[2:23] and it was it was necessary but he take
[2:28] off the old road and put on another one
[2:31] to be able to pay the price for you and
[2:35] I so it is not it is not unfair for him
[2:38] to ask you and I also to take off some
[2:42] old stuff so that we can be filled with
[2:45] some new stuff so that we can be clothed
[2:48] with a new reality it's not a Baptist
[2:50] sunday-school story it's what makes you
[2:53] a new creature it's what gives you a new
[2:56] identity it's what gives us hope that
[3:00] this life is not the end and so if the
[3:03] word of the Lord should come to us
[3:05] sanctify yourselves wash your clothes
[3:09] change your garment it's he's not asking
[3:13] us the Spirit of God he's not bidding us
[3:16] to do anything better Jesus was not
[3:20] required to do
