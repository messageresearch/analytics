TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we possess we carry what we need to overcome it therefore anything that's in it any enemy that lives in your promise any enemy that lives in the land of your inheritance if God said I'm giving you that land he's also going to give you the power to overcome whatever stands between you and possessing your inheritance he'll not tell you to do something and not give you the authority and power to accomplish it and so it eliminates our excuses when we like to think we're the only one facing the kind of battle that we're facing we find out there's no temptation but such is common demand you can't expect the possession or The Inheritance without a battle we we're not here in the last days going to a picnic we're in a battle we're not on a playground we're on a battlefield and anything worth having is worth fighting to get come on all you've got to do is just read the book of promise we are to be a people of the book and that means that what's promised to us is supposed to be what we have in front of us as our vision as our goal if God said I'm going to give you overcoming power you're going to defeat every devil in your life you're going to over come every habit every addiction every situation if God said that it's because he knows that he's given us not he's going to give us he's given us what we need not only take it but to overcome it to get on top of it to get to the other side overcome is not just getting higher than your problem overcoming is to get clear over to the other side of your problem so that you've got the authority then to deal with the problem sometimes you can't speak to a mountain from this side sometime you got to get over to the other side before you can talk to it because there's a promise sometimes that goes with a territory and our territory is not on this side of Jordan our promised inheritance is on the other side we have to poke our heads up above what we see with our five senses and we have to take the promise instead of the condition that we see remember we're not thermometers we're thermostats amen so if you are attracting problems in situation it's probably because you're destined to overcome that kind of thing so get ready because there are seeds of Destiny this isn't you know the power of positive thinking I'm talking about I'm talking about a seed of destiny that was swn into your life before you got here because the Bible said before we ever came he knew us
