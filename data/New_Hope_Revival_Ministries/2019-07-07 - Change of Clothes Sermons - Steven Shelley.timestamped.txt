[0:16] a man Genesis chapter 35 beginning in
[0:21] verse 1 if I should say something this
[0:26] morning that is true would you say Amen
[0:32] would you nod louder stomp your foot
[0:36] louder wag your finger a little more
[0:39] violently most of all engage your heart
[0:44] because the Lord has something he wants
[0:47] to say to us again today and I need his
[0:51] help to get it across I need his help to
[0:54] weed it down Whittle it down a little
[0:57] bit for the time that we have allotted
[0:59] to us this morning you pray that God
[1:02] will help us it's a good word when we
[1:05] get in the word we can easily get lost
[1:08] one place to another one scripture hangs
[1:12] on another scripture hang on another
[1:15] scripture the next thing you know you've
[1:16] just you've just about gone through it
[1:19] giver to giver
[1:20] right Genesis 35 1 and God said unto
[1:24] Jacob arise go up to Bethel and dwell
[1:29] there and make there an altar unto God
[1:34] that appeared unto thee when thou fled
[1:37] us
[1:38] from the face of Esau thy brother then
[1:43] Jacob said unto his household and to all
[1:47] that were with him put away the strange
[1:50] gods that are among you and be clean and
[1:55] change your garments let us arise and go
[2:01] up to Bethel and I will make there an
[2:06] altar unto God who answered me in the
[2:10] day of my distress and was with me in
[2:15] the way which I went and they gave unto
[2:20] Jacob all the strange gods which were in
[2:24] their hand and all their earrings which
[2:28] were in their ears
[2:29] and Jacob hid them under the oak which
[2:33] was by Shechem how many of you think
[2:37] that is something to look at this
[2:39] morning I believe it's what the Lord
[2:41] would have us to look at would you just
[2:43] bow your head for a moment Lord Jesus we
[2:51] thank you that your presence has been
[2:54] among us today we are not surprised you
[2:58] promised to come you're faithful to come
[3:01] thank you for the worship thank you Lord
[3:05] for a few minutes there it felt like
[3:08] celebration and we have so much to
[3:11] celebrate and so much to thank you for
[3:14] lord I thank you that you have also
[3:17] chosen our praise and our worship many
[3:21] times as warfare and when we move we're
[3:25] moving things in another dimension Lord
[3:29] when the anointing of the Spirit of the
[3:31] Lord falls on our heart we know and we
[3:34] move in response to what the Spirit is
[3:37] doing we know Lord that things are being
[3:40] shifted around in the second heaven oh
[3:43] how we desire to push away the darkness
[3:47] that permeates the second dimension the
[3:50] second heaven and so that we might like
[3:53] Jacob at Bethel be able to look right up
[3:56] and see the face of God we thank you for
[3:59] every person here and every person who
[4:02] has joined us by the way of streaming
[4:04] Lord speak to your people have your
[4:08] wonderful way as the word of truth goes
[4:10] forth and we will give you glory and
[4:13] honor and praise for it's in the name of
[4:16] our Messiah Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ
[4:19] we pray and the Saints said you may be
[4:22] seated I want you to be comfortable I
[4:31] want you to listen to this one more time
[4:36] God said unto Jacob arise go up to
[4:40] Bethel and dwell there
[4:42] and make V an altar unto God that
[4:46] appeared unto thee when thou fled us
[4:48] from the face of Esau thy brother then
[4:51] Jacob said unto his household and all
[4:54] that were with him put away the strange
[4:57] gods that are among you evidently in
[5:00] their journeying they had picked up some
[5:03] of the little idols that were made to
[5:07] false gods why would they do such a
[5:10] thing
[5:10] have you ever thought about why would
[5:13] they do such a thing do you think they
[5:15] got weary because they didn't feel like
[5:17] what they had was working and so they
[5:20] picked up something that somebody else
[5:22] had hoping that it would it would what
[5:25] causes a Christian to believe in luck
[5:29] what causes a Christian to believe in
[5:32] fate what causes a Christian to have the
[5:36] attitude that brother Greely mentioned
[5:38] not too long ago que sera sera whatever
[5:41] will be will be that's not the doctrine
[5:43] of the scripture concerning
[5:45] predestination that's not what
[5:47] predestination is well what would make a
[5:50] Christian participate in with a Ouija
[5:53] board or go to a fortune-teller or even
[5:57] follow their horoscope I know what
[6:01] brother Branham said about those signs
[6:03] being part of a Bible that was written
[6:05] in the heaven but I want you to know the
[6:07] people that write those things to go in
[6:09] the newspaper there they're not they're
[6:12] not astronomers they're they're wrapped
[6:15] up in the new age and they're riding
[6:18] things from a false perspective you
[6:21] can't trust your horoscope reading in
[6:25] the newspaper or online any more than
[6:28] you can your fortune cookie how many of
[6:31] you know you're not going to live your
[6:32] life based on the fortune cookie if you
[6:35] get a good one you're gonna celebrate it
[6:37] you're gonna say well oh I claim that
[6:40] that's different if you don't like it
[6:44] you're gonna do what Mall did one time
[6:46] she ate it to this day she has never
[6:51] told me I guess that ship has sailed and
[6:54] I will never know unless the Lord
[6:56] chose me but she got one one day that so
[6:58] offended her I said mother you must have
[7:02] read it wrong I have never seen a
[7:05] fortune cookie rebuked somebody or
[7:08] correct them or straighten it out you
[7:11] must have misunderstood and she ate it
[7:14] she didn't want it to be so I said don't
[7:17] you know what you eat becomes a part of
[7:19] you she said well how do we cancel that
[7:21] I don't know why Christians reach out
[7:26] for other things but I'm going to
[7:29] believe that perhaps it's because they
[7:32] don't feel like what they're doing is
[7:33] working and they're looking for
[7:35] something else the problem is when we do
[7:39] that we open ourselves up not just to
[7:43] the look or the charm that's supposed to
[7:47] come with some of these little things
[7:48] but we open ourselves up to every demon
[7:52] spirit that is a sign to follow that
[7:55] form of religion or that false worship
[7:58] so God's people have to be very very
[8:01] careful you you can make a false god out
[8:05] of anything that you adore it's not
[8:09] wrong to adore it's not wrong to have
[8:12] things that you love enjoy like want to
[8:17] participate in having a hobby is not
[8:20] wrong having a favorite author is not
[8:23] wrong as long as he's writing something
[8:25] that glorifies God that God is in the
[8:29] middle of but it's not witchcraft
[8:31] because you may think that it's innocent
[8:34] but I want you to know demons have been
[8:37] assigned to follow those things into
[8:41] people's lives too much to tell and I'm
[8:44] not preaching on the occult this morning
[8:46] but I want you to know Jacob was taking
[8:49] the people upward to Bethel and in order
[8:53] to do that the word of the Lord came and
[8:56] he said you got to tell these people put
[8:58] away the little strange gods that are
[9:00] among you and be clean be purify help me
[9:05] now am I telling the truth then let me
[9:09] hear
[9:09] I'm in a little bit be clean let the
[9:13] Lord cleanse you and when you get clean
[9:17] don't put back on your dirty clothes
[9:26] I'd like to preach this morning if I had
[9:31] a title I would call this a change of
[9:33] clothes if I had a subtitle I would call
[9:38] it be sure to change your underwear how
[9:45] many of you ever heard mama
[9:46] now I'm not exaggerating when I tell you
[9:50] that my mother and my mother's mother
[9:54] believed in leaving the house with clean
[9:57] underwear I don't know what's gonna
[10:01] happen one time my mother said you
[10:07] wouldn't want to be standing on the side
[10:08] of the road if you broke down with dirty
[10:10] underwear
[10:10] I said who would know but me I don't
[10:16] plan to lose my britches but she said no
[10:21] no no you anything could happen if you
[10:22] go to the hospital you don't want to
[10:24] have on dirty underwear
[10:26] well we don't have that problem in our
[10:28] house because we have two sons that
[10:31] change underwear multiple times every
[10:33] day and if you don't believe that just
[10:35] ask the poor woman who has to do the
[10:37] washing it would be foolish for you and
[10:41] I've to get a good shower and scrub up
[10:45] with some good soap get all the dirt off
[10:49] what we used to call what what did they
[10:52] used to call it when you would be
[10:54] playing outside and you get really dirty
[10:56] and you would sweat and it would make a
[10:58] little chain around your your neck like
[11:02] a knot on your collar but it'll do that
[11:04] or ring around the collar but they used
[11:06] to call that say it again something what
[11:10] kind of beads
[11:12] granny beads I never heard it called
[11:14] that but that's that's a good name for
[11:17] it you've seen that happen children get
[11:20] so dirty outside playing then the sweat
[11:22] you look like they have a necklace on so
[11:24] you scrub all that off
[11:26] you scrub everywhere that needs to be
[11:28] scrubbed and that's everywhere and when
[11:30] you're all scrubbed up you don't go over
[11:34] to the pile and pick up the same old
[11:36] dirty clothes and dirty underwear and
[11:38] the dirty clothes that you took off you
[11:41] don't put them back on because then you
[11:45] don't smell good anymore
[11:47] you smell like nobody knows you've taken
[11:50] a bath because you smell the same put
[11:53] away the strange gods that are among you
[11:56] be clean and change your clothes it's
[12:00] very important he went on to say and let
[12:04] us arise and go up to Bethel and I will
[12:08] make Varon altar unto God who answered
[12:11] me in the day of my distress and was
[12:14] with me in the way which I went they
[12:17] gave unto Jacob their strange gods which
[12:20] were in their hand and their earrings
[12:27] will need little water to get this one
[12:29] out mm-hmm and their earrings which were
[12:35] in their ears and Jacob hid them under
[12:39] the oak which was by Shechem I was
[12:43] reading in one I think it was Wesley I'm
[12:49] thinking that it was John Wesley who
[12:51] said they ought not to have buried them
[12:53] under the tree they ought to burn them
[12:56] because when we lay down something
[12:59] strange and false it's too easy to get
[13:02] discouraged and go back and pick up the
[13:05] very thing that we laid down in that
[13:07] write how many of you think it's a good
[13:09] idea to burn your ploughs and ball your
[13:12] oxen so you don't have anything to lean
[13:14] on to go back to Amen I tell these
[13:17] ladies who get victory over britches I
[13:20] say get rid of them don't give them away
[13:27] don't put them on somebody else and make
[13:31] them step into perversion I'm just
[13:35] telling what the word saying
[13:37] it's it's a bending of genders look what
[13:41] we got we have adults not just children
[13:44] we have adults that don't know what
[13:46] they're supposed to be come on you know
[13:50] the the church didn't like that
[13:52] old-fashioned preaching back then they
[13:55] they began to compromise and they said
[13:58] it's just old-fashioned man they're
[14:01] chauvinist they're just coming against
[14:03] us they just don't want us to be free
[14:06] and now look what a spirit has taken
[14:09] over now because men and women dress the
[14:15] same wear their hair the same now
[14:19] they're all confused you say that didn't
[14:22] have anything to do with it oh yes it
[14:23] did because there was a spirit attached
[14:26] to that it was an assignment against the
[14:29] Church of the Living God
[14:31] and nobody wants to stand against it but
[14:34] thank God there were men who remained
[14:36] faithful to say what you don't know
[14:40] better maybe you've never heard you
[14:42] didn't know any better you've never come
[14:44] under any influence where anybody could
[14:46] point you to the word in the right
[14:48] direction well when you come into that
[14:49] kind of an atmosphere you can hear the
[14:52] truth you can be filled with the genuine
[14:54] Holy Ghost and the same spirit that
[14:58] convicted our mothers and grandmothers
[15:00] can convict you it's not what department
[15:05] you buy them in it's the spirit behind
[15:08] them and I'm not gonna preach on clothes
[15:10] today I am gonna preach on clothes but
[15:13] not in that way
[15:14] there's just no reason for it and these
[15:18] ear bobs and earrings Jacob said you
[15:21] can't carry them up to Bethel get rid of
[15:24] your idols and your earrings this is not
[15:29] the only time that they had to be I read
[15:31] where one Jewish commentator said well
[15:34] it wasn't the earring he's it was
[15:36] against it was where they got him well
[15:37] they doesn't tell me what store they
[15:39] bought him and it just tells me it was
[15:43] another adopted custom something that
[15:46] they picked up from those who worships
[15:49] range gods well I'm not gonna preach
[15:51] that today I'm just gonna introduce what
[15:55] I am gonna preach I am gonna preach we
[15:58] all need a change of clothes can I have
[16:01] a little more in the monitor we need a
[16:03] change of clothes and I am gonna preach
[16:06] be sure before you leave the house to
[16:08] change your underwear I am gonna preach
[16:10] on that because we need to make sure
[16:12] that we remain clean when when we're
[16:15] cleansed when God cleanses us amen what
[16:19] I want to emphasize in verse 2 is change
[16:22] your garments now garments our clothes
[16:26] in the Bible it's a metaphor for putting
[16:30] off the old and putting on the new
[16:34] clothing natural clothing the robes and
[16:38] and tunics and ephod Xand and things
[16:42] like that the Bible talks about clothing
[16:45] the clothing of the priests it's there's
[16:48] a whole lot set in the Bible about
[16:50] clothes but it's also used
[16:53] metaphorically as a covering for what is
[16:57] underneath the covering of our nakedness
[17:00] not only physical but spiritual or you
[17:02] are you still with me
[17:04] and it goes all the way through the
[17:06] Bible and I don't have time to read or
[17:10] preach the twenty pages that I have
[17:12] prepared for this sermon so I'm going to
[17:16] have to move quickly and in order to do
[17:18] that you're going to have to stay with
[17:19] me and also every now and again say lord
[17:22] help him to stay on on topic because
[17:25] there will be another time and if
[17:27] there's not another time for me somebody
[17:29] will come along and finish what needs to
[17:32] be said you're gonna have God's gonna
[17:34] make sure to get to all of us what we
[17:37] need he'll get it to us one way or the
[17:40] other
[17:40] he's always gonna have a man he'll bring
[17:43] the word to us I believe that
[17:46] Philippians 2 I want you to go there
[17:49] Philippians 2 verses five through eight
[17:52] it's gonna be on the screen but if you
[17:55] have your Bible look at it there it's a
[17:57] very familiar portion of Scripture
[18:02] you can relax because I'm gonna get off
[18:05] the physical clothes I'm gonna get on
[18:09] the metaphor because I want you to see
[18:12] it but keep in mind that what you wear
[18:16] is a reflection of who you are
[18:21] Philippians 2:5 you can relax now I
[18:24] think I'm done let this mine let this
[18:27] mind be in you which was also in Christ
[18:31] Jesus let this mind be in you which was
[18:34] always in Christ Jesus now we will
[18:37] discover what mind was in him it goes on
[18:41] to say who being in the form of God
[18:45] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[18:49] God this was what was in his mind go
[18:53] back for me this is what was in his mind
[18:56] who being in the form of God thought it
[18:59] not robbery to be equal with God that
[19:03] was in our Lord's mind the next verse
[19:06] but made himself of no reputation we
[19:11] thank God for King James but there's a
[19:14] whole lot more to that phrase than King
[19:17] James gives us and took upon him the
[19:19] form of a servant though we were God
[19:23] though he knew that it was not robbery
[19:26] to say to feel that he was equal to God
[19:29] he made a choice this was his mind the
[19:33] Apostle is encouraging you and I to take
[19:36] and have the same mind the same thought
[19:39] process that we should also take upon
[19:42] ourselves the form of a servant that's
[19:46] what's being emphasized in these verses
[19:49] of Scripture and was made in the
[19:51] likeness of men thank God he was and
[19:54] being full and being found in fashion as
[19:58] a man he humbled himself this is also a
[20:02] necessity it's a part of what we need to
[20:05] have in our mind
[20:07] that we would also humble ourselves and
[20:10] also he became obedient unto death we
[20:13] also have to become obedient unto death
[20:16] his death was the death of the cross
[20:19] your death was the death of the same
[20:22] cross how many of you know he died you
[20:26] were in him that day your sin was judged
[20:29] and you died the very same day this is
[20:33] what the New Testament teaches us and it
[20:35] doesn't just hint at it it's very very
[20:37] clear all right let's move forward
[20:42] changing clothing clothing and the
[20:46] changing of a person's garment it's
[20:48] often used in the scriptures as a
[20:51] metaphor for a much deeper truth than
[20:54] just the outward covering of our body it
[20:58] begins in the very beginning clothing
[21:03] can you can you imagine where I'm going
[21:05] it begins the first mention of a
[21:08] meaningful change of clothes takes place
[21:11] in Genesis the book of beginnings when
[21:13] Adam and Eve covered themselves with
[21:15] aprons of fig leaves when they realize
[21:19] they were naked in Genesis 3:7
[21:22] this is the first time that there's any
[21:24] mention of putting on clothes to cover
[21:27] your nakedness it's in the beginning
[21:29] it's in the very beginning but God
[21:32] Himself came down and killed animals to
[21:36] make them coats of skin Genesis 3:21 we
[21:41] know as a as a Bible believing Bunch we
[21:44] know that that was a shadow of millions
[21:47] of lambs that would be killed in the
[21:50] tabernacle and the temple and it pointed
[21:53] toward the ultimate Lamb of God which
[21:56] was slain from the foundation of the
[21:59] world every bit of that death from from
[22:02] the first animals that were slain and
[22:04] their skin was removed as clothes to
[22:09] cover their nakedness and the Prophet
[22:11] said there they went out I can see them
[22:14] walking out of the garden with those
[22:16] bloody clothes those
[22:18] bloody skins flapping the back of their
[22:21] legs they would never be the same
[22:24] so clothing again something physical but
[22:29] it was also something metaphoric God was
[22:33] using the covering of the of the out the
[22:35] natural body as a metaphor for what it
[22:39] means to be covered to be protected to
[22:43] be behind something that will shield you
[22:46] from from judgment from wrath from
[22:50] whatever is about to break out I want
[22:52] you to know I don't know what's about to
[22:54] break out but the earth is shaking yeah
[23:00] they were arguing over whether a 6.4 was
[23:03] big and whether anyone should be
[23:06] concerned about a 6.4 and then they
[23:08] found out that's a foreshock it was not
[23:13] a it was not an earthquake that stands
[23:15] alone but a four-shot for a greater one
[23:18] that would happen the next day 7.1 I
[23:20] heard on Fox News this morning they were
[23:23] telling us that they're very prepared as
[23:28] prepared as you possibly can be for a
[23:31] third one as part of the same sequence
[23:34] of activity and thinking that it very
[23:39] possibly could be even larger than the
[23:42] seven point one we may find out he said
[23:44] in the next 24 to 48 hours that both of
[23:47] these earthquakes were four shots of
[23:50] something bigger notice neither of these
[23:53] on the San Andreas Fault but enough
[23:58] enough to shake people up you saw them
[24:02] like I did interviewed where they
[24:04] wouldn't go and sleep in their homes
[24:05] where even the elderly slept in their
[24:08] yard that whole night because they
[24:11] didn't want to go back in their house
[24:12] and have the thing collapse on top of
[24:14] them come on now the earth is shaking
[24:17] it's coming it's coming
[24:21] some I said is this the one is this the
[24:24] time I can tell you it's the time yes
[24:27] the time it may not be this week it may
[24:30] not be next week but
[24:32] living in the season where California is
[24:37] not only going into the ocean but if you
[24:40] listen carefully to what the Prophet
[24:42] said it actually slides like a plate
[24:45] back under what's left of North America
[24:48] now if that really slides back under
[24:51] that honeycomb that's underneath
[24:53] California I want you to know that it
[24:56] just goes all the way across it affects
[24:59] everything all the way across our
[25:01] continent
[25:03] I want to be ready I want to know I'm
[25:06] ready and I want to pray for people who
[25:09] are not ready I want to ask the Lord to
[25:12] speak to their hearts but it is getting
[25:15] us to be a serious time something like
[25:18] this the largest at 20 years and don't
[25:23] you don't you think for one minute that
[25:25] people don't think about it at least
[25:26] some may not take it serious but it's in
[25:30] their mind
[25:31] could this be did any of you see the the
[25:35] footage of the of the swimming pool that
[25:37] looked like the ocean the water sloshing
[25:42] all the way out of the swimming pool I
[25:44] want you to know it must be a terrifying
[25:46] thing when the earth is shaking like
[25:49] that underneath you I'm not going to
[25:51] argue with anybody about whether it's
[25:53] God's judgement or wrath or not but I
[25:55] will tell you that this nation has been
[25:57] indicted and God has said through his
[26:01] servant that judgment has struck the
[26:04] west coast starting in the late 60s all
[26:10] the way up to this time so we are in the
[26:13] time of that which has been prophesized
[26:16] you could say Amen or me in the
[26:18] scripture that we read about Jacob he
[26:21] was clear he told the people that in
[26:24] preparation to go up to the house of God
[26:26] putting away all the idols would be
[26:28] necessary but he also insisted that the
[26:31] people wash themselves and changed their
[26:34] clothes putting away even the clothes
[26:37] that had been symbolically defiled there
[26:41] may have been no real physical dirt on
[26:44] the
[26:44] clothes but those clothes had been
[26:47] symbolically defiled by the lies that
[26:50] they had accepted by the idols that they
[26:53] had held in their hand by the trinkets
[26:57] by the doodads that they had adopted
[27:02] that were from a people who had refused
[27:05] to follow the truth of God come on now
[27:08] so it's serious a change of heart would
[27:13] also have to take place among those that
[27:16] Jacob was talking to motives and
[27:18] intentions would need to be evaluated
[27:20] but this was a beginning a step in the
[27:24] right direction that even they even had
[27:28] to give up their their trinkets and
[27:29] their doodads that were esteemed by
[27:31] those who they had borrowed these
[27:34] strange gods from you you need to
[27:37] consider what the world goes after what
[27:41] the world is enticed by what the world
[27:44] is attracted by there could very likely
[27:47] be spirits involved that are out to
[27:51] affect you in a very negative way we got
[27:53] to take a bath we've got to change our
[27:55] clothes even if we look down and we
[27:57] don't see any soil we don't see any dirt
[28:00] maybe we are symbolically defiled by
[28:03] where we have walked and who we have
[28:04] eaten with and what we have participated
[28:07] in and what we have ran after things
[28:11] that we have put on our bodies books we
[28:14] have read videos we've watched things
[28:17] we've done a change of clothing was
[28:19] necessary for the people to move onward
[28:22] and to move upward then after the Exodus
[28:26] stay with me then after the Exodus the
[28:28] children of Israel leaving Egypt to go
[28:31] out into that Promised Land we find
[28:34] another portion of Scripture about the
[28:36] changing of clothes about the cleansing
[28:39] that needed to take place because the
[28:41] children of Israel were leaving slavery
[28:44] they were on their way to Mount Sinai
[28:46] High where there was going to be a
[28:48] marriage covenant made between God and
[28:52] the nation of Israel and there had to be
[28:54] some preparation
[28:57] and will wait on you there had to be
[29:00] some preparation made to get them into
[29:04] that holy moment a change of clothing
[29:08] was gonna be necessary
[29:11] exodus chapter 19 verse 10 through 14
[29:14] i'm just going to read pieces of it when
[29:17] moses told the words of the people to to
[29:20] the lord the lord said to moses go to
[29:23] the people and consecrate them today and
[29:25] tomorrow and let them wash their
[29:27] garments and be ready for the third day
[29:30] for on the third day the Lord will come
[29:32] down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all
[29:35] the people so moses went down from the
[29:37] mountain to the people and consecrated
[29:40] the people and they washed their
[29:43] garments now they were gonna get dirty
[29:46] again out in that wilderness but this
[29:50] was a physical act of washing their
[29:54] clothes that had a much deeper spiritual
[29:58] meaning there was something much bigger
[30:01] going on than just the washing of a
[30:04] physical robe but this was a
[30:06] consecrating a sanctifying it was
[30:11] something to draw the people's minds
[30:13] toward God and off of their past you see
[30:19] it's one thing to get the children of
[30:20] Israel out of Egypt amen
[30:25] but it's another thing to get Egypt out
[30:28] of the children of Israel my granny used
[30:31] to say you can take the girl out of the
[30:32] country but you can't get the country
[30:34] out of the girl I'm still a country girl
[30:37] at heart
[30:37] and in the spiritual it works that way
[30:40] you've got a slavery mentality you've
[30:44] got a fascination with what you saw the
[30:47] Egyptians fascinated with and so the
[30:50] children of Israel we all know they had
[30:52] to be not only did they have to clean
[30:54] their clothes wash their clothes so that
[30:56] this covenant could be made on Mount
[30:58] Sinai huh but we also know they all had
[31:01] to make a journey through the Red Sea
[31:03] which the New Testament tells us was a
[31:06] baptism it was a ritual cleansing even
[31:10] though the water
[31:11] didn't touch them it was a spiritual
[31:14] cleansing it wasn't it because they had
[31:18] to get some more of the residue of Egypt
[31:22] out of their lives may God help us to do
[31:24] the same they wash their garments and
[31:27] then we look at the priests and even the
[31:30] high priest in the Bible there are
[31:32] various changes of garment by both the
[31:36] priest for the priest and the high
[31:38] priest one example is found in Leviticus
[31:41] chapter 6 verses 9 through 11 just put
[31:45] that up there in case somebody would
[31:46] like to look at it and and even jot it
[31:49] down command Aaron and his son saying
[31:52] this is the law of the burnt offering it
[31:55] is the burnt offering because of the
[31:57] burning upon the altar all night under
[31:59] the morning and the fire of the altar
[32:01] shall be burning in it and the priest
[32:03] shall put on his linen garment and his
[32:05] linen breeches shellye put upon his
[32:07] flesh and take up the ashes which the
[32:10] fire hath consumed with the burn all
[32:12] offering on the altar and he shall put
[32:14] them beside the altar verse 11 and he
[32:17] shall put off his garments and put on
[32:21] other garments and carry forth the ashes
[32:26] without the camp unto a clean place is
[32:31] that what he says now he was already
[32:35] standing in holy garments not golden
[32:38] garments the golden garments were those
[32:41] ceremonial garments that were worn by
[32:43] the high priest with the breastplate
[32:45] with a with the beautiful gold mitre on
[32:48] his head he was rather standing in the
[32:51] in the garments of a priest in ministry
[32:54] one who was working serving and
[32:57] ministering before the Lord and even
[32:59] that had to be removed and he had to put
[33:03] on something else before he could carry
[33:06] the ashes without the camp there's a key
[33:09] but you say what's it to an unclean
[33:13] place he couldn't wear those consecrated
[33:16] garments to an unclean place he wasn't
[33:19] going to an unclean place he was going
[33:22] to a
[33:22] place that had been sanctified and
[33:24] consecrated as a place to receive the
[33:27] ashes but he was going to pass through a
[33:29] place he was going to pass through a
[33:33] place that was without the camp and so
[33:36] the word of the Lord was you got to
[33:38] change your clothes when you get out
[33:41] there and dump those ashes and I said
[33:42] well it was a dirty job you don't think
[33:45] what was going on before that was dirty
[33:46] he's ministering on the on the altar the
[33:49] fire he's already moving the ashes
[33:52] around inside it wasn't because it was
[33:54] physically a dirty job it was because
[33:57] there would be defilement and God said I
[34:00] want there to be a clear distinction
[34:03] between the garments for sacred duty and
[34:09] the garments for common duty even though
[34:13] it was still the work of the tabernacle
[34:15] it was still the work of the temple
[34:17] anybody with me brother Branham said
[34:20] when you come to the house of God you
[34:22] need to wear your best just tell me what
[34:26] he said it's not because your clothes
[34:29] earns you anything in the kingdom of God
[34:32] it's not because you you should be
[34:35] puffed up and how fashionable you can be
[34:38] and how good-looking you can be in your
[34:40] clothes
[34:40] but it's because this is a holy
[34:42] gathering he said you don't pull out the
[34:46] word you know if the best you've got is
[34:48] a clean pressed pair of overhauls then
[34:52] you ought to wear your overhauls and you
[34:54] are not to be ashamed to do it but he
[34:58] said when you come to the house of God
[35:00] you ought to wear the best you have and
[35:02] you're doing that in the same order the
[35:06] same order that the priest was told
[35:10] change your garments when you go outside
[35:13] the camp even into the holy place to
[35:16] dump the ashes so it's not wild of us or
[35:22] outlandish of us to say that we as a
[35:26] body of believers when we come to the
[35:28] house of the Lord we should take a
[35:30] moment to look the best we can I'm gonna
[35:34] say it again
[35:37] it won't hurt us to tuck our hair in
[35:39] place
[35:42] it won't hurt us if you've got any
[35:46] breeches that aren't holey
[35:48] wear your non holy ones no one is going
[35:54] to judge you by what you wear they last
[35:59] some time women will say can I come in
[36:02] my slacks we always tell them come
[36:04] however you feel comfortable you come
[36:08] how you feel comfortable we're going to
[36:11] depend on the Lord to take care of the
[36:14] rest but we're not going to be ashamed
[36:16] of what God has called us to so remember
[36:21] this there was a reason for it the
[36:25] changing of the garment to distinguish
[36:30] to differentiate between not the holy
[36:35] and the profane but the holy and the
[36:39] common will you help me when church
[36:44] becomes common when we treat church like
[36:52] it's the same as being at home then it's
[37:00] easy to see that kind of a person
[37:03] they're never on time they never stay
[37:08] till it's over
[37:09] they never act engaged they lay across
[37:13] the Pew instead of sitting up like
[37:16] they're in a place that requires their
[37:18] their attention come on now I'm just
[37:21] preaching when people don't see the
[37:23] difference not between I'm not talking
[37:25] about the profane and the holy I'm
[37:27] talking about the common and the holy
[37:31] see Christians know the difference
[37:34] between holy and profane but sometimes
[37:38] we forget the difference between holy
[37:41] and common remember brother Branham said
[37:46] this is not a place to do your talking
[37:48] with one another this is a set apart
[37:51] place
[37:51] oh I'm adamant notes it's a set apart
[37:55] place and do you remember brother green
[37:57] saying he he heard that and he wanted to
[38:00] be so careful about that and one day he
[38:02] just wanted to do anything that he could
[38:04] to be a blessing and he grabbed a broom
[38:07] from dock brother Brandon's brother and
[38:09] brother Green was just sweeping around
[38:11] the pews and he said I was trying to be
[38:14] so careful that I didn't even bump the
[38:16] broom it was empty
[38:18] the people had gone out but he said I so
[38:21] respected that place based on what
[38:23] brother Branham had said I didn't even
[38:25] want my broom to bump the end of the Pew
[38:27] and disturb the presence of the Lord
[38:29] that had just been moving in that room
[38:31] and he said imagine my surprise when
[38:34] brother Branham came out of his study
[38:36] and and hollered across the empty room
[38:39] and said hey brother Perry let's do
[38:41] breakfast in the morning over at
[38:43] so-and-so and he said I responded back
[38:49] to brother Branham and I said he said
[38:54] can't you hear me he said yes sir I was
[38:58] just trying we were in the sanctuary
[39:01] this was in his mind you see I like to
[39:05] remember that story because it's
[39:08] important that we don't become a
[39:10] legalistic about anything you know if
[39:18] somebody has a decision to make I have
[39:22] time to get to church but I don't have
[39:26] time to go home and clean the cotton out
[39:29] of my hair or the grease out from under
[39:31] my fingernails or to put on a nicer set
[39:35] of clothes I believe with all my heart
[39:37] that you would be more in line with what
[39:40] God wants for your life for you to come
[39:44] here as you are than to say I knew I
[39:49] wasn't dressed appropriately I knew I
[39:51] had dirt on me and I just couldn't come
[39:53] to church that's being legal either
[39:56] you're making an excuse for not being
[39:58] here or you're just being a little bit
[40:00] legal because we would rather
[40:02] you come as you are and enjoy the
[40:05] presence of the Lord and help us build
[40:07] up to something you're needed you're
[40:11] needed you may think it's only your
[40:14] offering this needed but your or you may
[40:18] feel that we feel that way but you are
[40:20] needed your spot needs you in it as
[40:25] often as possible and your voice is
[40:29] needed you're a man I don't need you're
[40:33] a man to tell me that I'm telling the
[40:35] truth I know I'm telling the truth
[40:39] because I've found it in God's Word I
[40:41] need your amen because I want you to be
[40:45] a part of the journey we're on a journey
[40:49] this morning we're like these children
[40:52] of Israel that Jacob was talking to
[40:54] we've got to go onward
[40:56] and we've got to go upward and in order
[40:59] to do that we've got to participate if
[41:03] the word of the Lord says bathe
[41:05] yourselves and change your clothes you
[41:08] don't need to look down and say well you
[41:11] know I don't see I don't think I I don't
[41:16] think I'm dirty I don't know what see
[41:18] anything wrong with these clothes what
[41:19] you need to do is go bathe yourself and
[41:23] change your clothes if that is the word
[41:26] of the Lord to us because we're moving
[41:28] as a body and we are on a journey I
[41:32] didn't I had no idea that this was going
[41:36] to take us in this direction this
[41:38] morning because this is not at all where
[41:40] I want to go I just got to get to where
[41:42] I want to go and I need you on the
[41:44] journey you know you may feel in your
[41:50] mind that you miss a few services you
[41:52] haven't missed very much but I want you
[41:54] to know we're on a journey and we're
[41:57] building line upon line and we're
[42:00] building precept upon precept because
[42:02] that's what the Word of God does and
[42:04] sometimes there's a piece in there one
[42:07] piece one little tiny
[42:11] Peace in a two-hour smorgasbord that we
[42:16] need to get a hold of in our life to
[42:19] take us somewhere else above what we're
[42:22] going through you know I'm preaching you
[42:24] know what I'm saying is right we need
[42:27] that and so take advantage when you
[42:30] can't be here take advantage of what's
[42:33] made available for you you if you
[42:36] weren't here last Sunday take a moment
[42:38] it's on your phone you you've got it
[42:42] free you don't have to login you don't
[42:44] have to put a password all you have to
[42:47] do just take a moment and see if there's
[42:49] anything about seed and harvest that you
[42:54] need to understand for where we are
[42:56] right now we're going to miss I'm going
[42:59] to miss you're going to miss there going
[43:02] to be times that we can't be here when I
[43:04] make my plans I plan as much as I
[43:07] possibly can to miss as little as I
[43:11] possibly can because I believe we're
[43:14] getting closer and closer and closer to
[43:16] the climax I also when I possibly can I
[43:22] try to go back I'm not always able to
[43:24] hear every sermon but I like to go back
[43:26] and hear what was said oh I bet you do
[43:29] so you can straighten them out there's
[43:30] really nothing to straighten out what I
[43:34] hear it's been has been such a blip for
[43:37] 34 years now what I have heard has been
[43:41] such a blessing and a big old amen and
[43:46] an exclamation point of truth that I
[43:49] love we're blessed you say Amen are on
[43:53] me I don't think anybody ought to say
[43:56] well I don't you know it was just just
[43:58] brother Greely preaching other or just
[43:59] hawk or just brother Kerry preaching I
[44:01] don't think I need to go back in I think
[44:03] you should I think if you have an
[44:06] opportunity if it's made available to
[44:07] you you should take advantage of that
[44:10] because there may be one little key my
[44:14] my my mind one little piece that you
[44:19] need for something that you're gonna
[44:21] face I don't make any apology for saying
[44:24] that
[44:25] it's just the truth it's just the truth
[44:28] and so understand that Christian people
[44:32] often know the difference between
[44:33] profane and holy where we get blurred is
[44:38] the difference between what is common
[44:40] and what is holy this is not the place
[44:43] to get your manicure this is God's house
[44:50] this isn't the place to check your email
[44:53] or check your facebook or post on
[44:57] Instagram that is common it's not
[45:03] necessarily profane but it's common
[45:07] there needs to be a separation a
[45:10] differentiation in our life between what
[45:13] is common and what is holy there are
[45:17] certain things you can do in a holy
[45:18] place that you can't do in a common
[45:20] place and maybe even vice versa
[45:23] and we need the Holy Ghost but sometimes
[45:25] he's there nudging us we get so used to
[45:30] it I really think it's a better idea if
[45:33] for for children to take their snacks
[45:36] out there I really think it's a better
[45:40] idea to do anything and everything we
[45:43] can do to teach them now and in fact
[45:47] most of the time they don't need a snack
[45:53] they just want one until we go into that
[45:57] third hour when we go into that third
[46:01] hour I need a snack so I understand when
[46:06] they do but there's a place now if you
[46:10] can just quietly stick something in
[46:12] their mouth and not make a disturbance
[46:13] and and that'll be it and you know that
[46:16] because you're the parent do it I don't
[46:19] want to be legal I'd rather you do that
[46:23] but if you see this is gonna be a food
[46:26] fest there's a place to do that come on
[46:30] now there's a common place to do common
[46:33] things and a holy place to do holy
[46:36] things
[46:37] and holy people can do common things in
[46:40] common places but holy people don't want
[46:42] to do common things in holy places all
[46:47] right I'm just giving you what the word
[46:49] said so we draw listen the high priest
[46:53] the Bible tells us that he changed his
[46:57] clothes once on the day of atonement but
[47:01] the the oral tradition is or if you read
[47:05] certain tractates of the Mishnah it
[47:07] tells us of 10 different washings some
[47:13] were whole-body immersions
[47:15] in a mikveh and several I think maybe
[47:18] three were just the washing of the hands
[47:21] and the feet but 10 times
[47:24] the Mishna says the high priest had to
[47:27] cleanse himself and change his garments
[47:30] five times in preparation for the day of
[47:33] atonement now this is you know extra I
[47:36] we don't have all of that outline for us
[47:39] in the scripture but that oral tradition
[47:41] that was passed on from generation to
[47:43] generation tells us that would wear
[47:45] somebody out but he was about to do
[47:48] something that he would only do one time
[47:50] a year he was about to enter into the
[47:53] most holy of holies and he was going in
[47:57] with the blood to sprinkle it on the
[48:00] mercy seat so that the sins of the
[48:03] entire nation could be covered for a
[48:07] whole year and he couldn't go in there
[48:10] defiled his life not only his life
[48:14] depended on it
[48:15] but the prosperity of the people the
[48:18] favor of God on the house depended on
[48:22] him going in making the right
[48:25] preparation to enter into that which is
[48:27] holy if you believe that same man so we
[48:30] draw from these scriptures the
[48:32] importance of making both spiritual and
[48:35] natural preparation that include a
[48:37] changing of our clothes as we are
[48:39] anticipating an entrance into the holy
[48:43] presence of God you got to leave it all
[48:47] I point back there that's the door I
[48:50] come in
[48:51] you gotta leave it all out there you
[48:56] tell me how to do it pastor and I will
[48:57] do it it's an act of your will it's a
[49:02] decision of your mind
[49:04] it is something that only you can do no
[49:06] one can do it for you it doesn't mean
[49:09] that it won't creep up again it doesn't
[49:11] mean that a thought won't try to get a
[49:12] hold of you while you're in here it
[49:14] doesn't mean that Satan won't whisper to
[49:16] you while you're trying to listen to the
[49:18] Word of God he will but we make a
[49:20] conscious decision we must to leave it
[49:24] all behind I'll stir every struggle
[49:28] every every burden every memory every
[49:31] everything that plagues us we do our
[49:33] best by the grace of God to leave it out
[49:36] there and to come in to worship God to
[49:40] hear the word of God to enter in well
[49:43] somebody is going to know that I'm
[49:45] really going through something and if
[49:47] they see me oh really will enter in and
[49:49] worshiping God they'll they'll think I'm
[49:51] putting on don't worry
[50:04] don't let anybody what you think they
[50:08] might think about your praise hinder you
[50:12] from praise I didn't let brother said -
[50:18] when you talked about the kangaroo
[50:19] anointing I didn't let that keep me from
[50:22] jumping cause that's how I feel sometime
[50:26] I can't hold it in any longer and I just
[50:29] feel a spring in my feet I mean it takes
[50:32] a lot to get me off the ground but but I
[50:34] can do it if I do it under the Lord
[50:37] I can dance if I do it under the Lord
[50:40] and I'm not only if your mind is on the
[50:43] Lord and you're getting ready to praise
[50:45] Him you don't have time to think about
[50:47] how somebody might perceive your praise
[50:50] give it all just give it all and
[50:53] there'll be nothing for anybody to say
[50:55] and then don't worry
[50:57] somebody will somebody will let that be
[51:04] on their hand
[51:05] don't let that be on your hands
[51:07] Zechariah 3 go there with me fleece for
[51:10] just a moment I have another hour that
[51:15] was the first one boy it went and quick
[51:17] Zechariah 3 verse 3 through 8 you know
[51:21] these stories I had a visitation in
[51:25] Jerusalem
[51:26] you know this these scriptures I meant
[51:28] to say I had a visitation very very
[51:32] similar to this in Jerusalem some years
[51:35] ago I think maybe I was sharing RJ was i
[51:41] sharing this experience the first time
[51:42] you were ever in a service where I was
[51:44] speaking I wasn't even scheduled to
[51:46] speak in that conference but I was there
[51:49] and I attended and was asked to speak
[51:51] and I shared about a visitation from
[51:54] Joshua the high priest because it's been
[51:57] so long since we mentioned it let's look
[51:59] at these verses again quickly now Joshua
[52:01] was clothed with filthy garments and
[52:03] stood before the angel and he answered
[52:06] and spake unto those that stood before
[52:08] him saying take away the filthy garments
[52:12] from him and unto him he said behold I
[52:15] have caused the iniquity to pass from
[52:18] thee and I will clothe thee with change
[52:22] of raiment and I said let them set a
[52:25] fair mitre which is a clean turban upon
[52:28] his head so they said a fair mitre upon
[52:31] his head and clothed him with garments
[52:33] and the angel of the Lord stood by once
[52:38] his clothes had been changed symbolizing
[52:42] the removal of his iniquity God went on
[52:46] to say and the angel of the Lord
[52:48] protested unto Joshua saying thus saith
[52:51] the Lord of Hosts if thou will walk in
[52:55] my ways if thou will keep my charge then
[53:00] thou shalt also judge my house and shall
[53:02] also keep my courts and I will give thee
[53:06] places to walk among these that stand by
[53:11] here now Oh Joshua the high priest thou
[53:14] and thy fellows that sit before thee for
[53:17] they
[53:17] men wonder that for behold I will bring
[53:20] forth my servant the branch here stood
[53:25] Joshua the high priest clothed in dirty
[53:30] garments in the presence of Almighty God
[53:33] how did he get there God brought him God
[53:37] brought him there God wanted him to see
[53:40] something that he was not able to see on
[53:43] his own
[53:44] I think Joshua would have looked at his
[53:47] clothes and he would have said well they
[53:50] may be a little wrinkled but they're all
[53:51] right
[53:52] but in the presence of God God said
[53:55] you're standing in filthy rags before me
[53:58] I want to remove your iniquity I want to
[54:00] take off those dirty clothes I want to
[54:02] give you a vessel garments to wear I
[54:04] want to put I want to make sure that you
[54:07] have a clean turban on your head because
[54:10] I'm inviting you to my council I'm
[54:13] inviting you I'm offering you free
[54:16] access you hear what that verse is
[54:19] saying I'm going to give you free access
[54:22] to move in and out of my courts but
[54:26] before you can have access to that holy
[54:29] place you're here now by invitation but
[54:34] if you want to be able to move in and
[54:35] out of this place you're going to have
[54:38] to allow this cleansing to take place
[54:41] and you're going to have to walk in my
[54:43] ways you're gonna have to keep my word
[54:45] you're gonna have to stand on the truth
[54:47] that I have revealed to you we know
[54:49] these verses we understand that it was
[54:52] residual dirt from the captivity just
[54:57] like it was residual dirt on the clothes
[54:59] of the children of Israel that had to be
[55:02] washed off that may not have been
[55:03] physically dirty but it was the residual
[55:06] of what it meant to be a slave it was
[55:08] the residual of what it meant to be over
[55:10] in captivity unable to worship God in
[55:13] the way that you were created to worship
[55:15] Him I want to go back with you for just
[55:17] a moment to the scripture that we read
[55:21] in Philippians but in order to do that I
[55:24] want to only read one verse verse seven
[55:26] in the amplified this was the scripture
[55:29] that we read that
[55:31] talked about who being in the form of
[55:32] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[55:34] with God but made himself of no
[55:36] reputation let me read this in the
[55:38] amplified because there's an interesting
[55:40] word that is used there that some of you
[55:42] are familiar with Philippians 2:7 in the
[55:46] amplified it says but he stripped
[55:48] himself this is Jesus this is our Savior
[55:54] he stripped himself of all privileges
[55:59] and rightful dignity so as to assume the
[56:07] guise of a servant a slave in that he
[56:11] became like men and was born a human
[56:16] being why are you reading that I'm
[56:19] reading that because Jesus received a
[56:22] change of clothes
[56:26] just like the priest just like Adam and
[56:30] Eve just like the children of Israel
[56:33] Jesus had a change of clothes he laid
[56:37] aside his royal robe of deity he laid
[56:43] aside his kingly robe he laid aside the
[56:47] glory here's what is very important to
[56:51] remember he laid aside the glory that he
[56:55] had shared with the father from before
[57:03] the beginning of the world the Bible
[57:06] tells us he laid all of that aside and
[57:10] he took on another set of clothes he
[57:13] stepped in to a set of clothes that was
[57:17] of this world come on he conducted
[57:22] himself no longer as the king of all
[57:25] kings but now he moved as a servant as a
[57:31] slave the word is kinaho are the act of
[57:38] canosa's whether Branham called it
[57:41] quino's
[57:43] and he would sometimes say he can oast
[57:47] himself he ke nos apostrophe D and the
[57:54] meaning was he emptied himself of the
[57:59] glory that he had once had with the
[58:01] Father now if you believe what I believe
[58:03] in many do not I believe that it was not
[58:07] just the glory that he emptied as he
[58:10] moved in his earthly ministry but I
[58:13] believe at the cross he gave up much of
[58:16] the rights much of the authority that he
[58:19] had had as the Word made flesh and I
[58:22] believe that he died as a man I believe
[58:28] that it was absolutely necessary I
[58:30] believe that of that that father that
[58:33] eternal spirit of the father that was
[58:35] with him was with him all the way to the
[58:38] cross even though he had already laid
[58:41] aside much of the glory that he had had
[58:43] with the father in the beginning but
[58:45] still the deity was there the very
[58:47] eternal spirit of the father was in him
[58:50] and there on the cross God can't die he
[58:54] couldn't die as a God how many of you
[58:56] understand that he could only die as
[58:59] someone who can die a man can die but
[59:02] God can't die and so the spirit of the
[59:04] Father I believe it was as though I
[59:06] almost ripped from him and he felt it
[59:13] how many of you know he responded father
[59:17] father why hast thou forsaken me let me
[59:23] tell you something dear he moves out of
[59:25] you you'll know you'll know that you've
[59:29] lost the touch this was much more than
[59:32] we could ever get our minds around this
[59:35] was all of God
[59:38] all of God living in one in one body of
[59:44] flesh all of God there might have been a
[59:49] rainbow somewhere there might have been
[59:52] a dove somewhere but all of God was
[59:55] living in that fleshly body that was God
[59:57] in flesh that was that was the Word of
[1:00:00] God made flesh and it was it was
[1:00:03] necessary that he take off the old robe
[1:00:07] and put on another one to be able to pay
[1:00:12] the price for you and I so it is not it
[1:00:15] is not unfair for him to ask you and I
[1:00:18] also to take off some old stuff so that
[1:00:22] we can be filled with some new stuff so
[1:00:25] that we can be clothed with a new
[1:00:27] reality with a new glory with the new
[1:00:30] identity or I thank God for the few of
[1:00:33] you that are with him in hearing me now
[1:00:34] I'm gonna say it that way thank God
[1:00:36] for those that can hear but I'm not
[1:00:38] quite done that word kinaho or kenosis
[1:00:42] the act of canosa's it means to empty to
[1:00:45] evacuate it means to make void to make
[1:00:56] of none effect it's translated in the
[1:01:00] New Testament to be in vain he emptied
[1:01:06] himself of the glory that he had with
[1:01:09] the father before the world was John 17
[1:01:13] and 5 to take on a new robe a robe of
[1:01:17] humanity a robe that had a soul attached
[1:01:22] to it the eternal spirit of the Father
[1:01:30] did not exist with the soul until he
[1:01:34] stepped into that body of flesh that new
[1:01:38] robe that Jesus wore to pay the price
[1:01:40] for you and I had a soul attached to it
[1:01:43] which means it had a mind and a will and
[1:01:47] emotions now God has a mind and God
[1:01:52] we'll and God has emotion but they're
[1:01:54] all tied to the fullness of who he is
[1:01:58] but the soul that entered into that body
[1:02:02] connected to that body of flesh was one
[1:02:04] that was more connected to this earth
[1:02:08] than the soul that we would imagine
[1:02:11] being in the very image and likeness of
[1:02:14] God we know that because the scripture
[1:02:18] tells us of the struggle if he would
[1:02:21] have had God's soul if there would be
[1:02:23] such a thing a soul that was more
[1:02:25] connected to the eternal spirit of the
[1:02:27] father there would have been no struggle
[1:02:29] the body the body would have just
[1:02:30] immediately been pushed into submission
[1:02:34] but because his soul was attached to
[1:02:37] that earthly body that he put on that
[1:02:39] rope that he put on he set off if at all
[1:02:43] possible if I could step back just think
[1:02:49] of this if he could have stepped back
[1:02:50] into that other robe the Royal robe the
[1:02:54] Regal robe the robe of of God it would
[1:03:00] have been so much easier no struggle
[1:03:03] involved but because his soul was
[1:03:05] attached to his earthly form he cried
[1:03:08] out if at all possible let this cup pass
[1:03:12] from me nevertheless not my will
[1:03:19] tells us he had a will that was contrary
[1:03:21] to the will of the Father that was that
[1:03:22] soul life attached to that physical body
[1:03:24] so I want you to know the decision that
[1:03:28] he made we often have said through the
[1:03:30] years if Jesus would ever have been
[1:03:33] tempted to fail us to quit us he would
[1:03:37] have done it not on the cross because by
[1:03:41] the time he got to the cross he was
[1:03:42] fully surrendered it would have been in
[1:03:46] the garden it would have been against
[1:03:47] cemani it would have been in the Olive
[1:03:49] Press did when he prayed and Dilli sweat
[1:03:52] appeared his great drops of blood and
[1:03:54] and medical science tells us the emotion
[1:03:58] and the heaviness that was on his soul
[1:04:01] had
[1:04:03] such an effect on his physical body that
[1:04:06] literally capillaries all over his body
[1:04:09] were bursting beneath the strain of the
[1:04:13] emotion and the weight of my sin until
[1:04:19] instead of salty liquid likes pouring
[1:04:22] out of the top of my head
[1:04:24] it was perspiration mixed with the blood
[1:04:28] that was flowing out of those ruptured
[1:04:31] capillaries and by the time he was at
[1:04:35] the cross they believed that more than
[1:04:37] capillaries vessels were bursting and
[1:04:41] eventually arteries were giving up that
[1:04:45] could not stand the weight or the load
[1:04:47] or the strain from what was happening
[1:04:50] and I want you to know how would you
[1:04:54] have liked to have been the mind of the
[1:04:57] Father that day he's won but in that
[1:05:03] moment the father had a will in the body
[1:05:07] that that spirit lived in had a will
[1:05:10] right does that confuse you how would
[1:05:14] you have liked to have had to make that
[1:05:15] decision of what precise moment you
[1:05:20] would exit the body I wonder did he
[1:05:26] whisper on his way out I don't want to
[1:05:31] leave like this
[1:05:33] but it must be I don't know all I know
[1:05:38] is that when that when that void that he
[1:05:43] had never felt before when that void
[1:05:46] happened he was ready to get it over
[1:05:49] with as fast as it possibly could this
[1:05:54] has got to end it is finished think of
[1:06:02] that it's not a Baptist sunday-school
[1:06:05] story it's what makes you a new creature
[1:06:08] it's what gives you a new identity it's
[1:06:12] what gives us hope that this life is not
[1:06:15] end and so if the word of the Lord
[1:06:18] should come to us sanctify yourselves
[1:06:22] wash your clothes change your garment
[1:06:26] it's he's not asking us the Spirit of
[1:06:28] God it's not bidding us to do anything
[1:06:31] but Jesus what's not required to do he
[1:06:37] had to change robes
[1:06:38] now his his former robe was more
[1:06:41] glorious than his earthly robe but
[1:06:45] nevertheless he had to make the change
[1:06:46] didn't he are you are you good for a few
[1:06:49] more moments good because I have to
[1:06:53] finish a little more will you turn to
[1:06:55] mark chapter 10 verse 46 they came to
[1:07:06] Jericho and as he went out of Jericho
[1:07:09] with his disciples a great number of
[1:07:12] people blind bartimaeus the son of
[1:07:14] Timaeus sat by the highway side begging
[1:07:18] and when he heard that it was Jesus of
[1:07:21] Nazareth he began to cry out and say
[1:07:23] Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me
[1:07:28] and many charged him that he should hold
[1:07:32] his peace god bless these many who
[1:07:42] wanted to restore the order but he cried
[1:07:46] out the more a great deal thou son of
[1:07:50] David have mercy on me and I want you to
[1:07:54] know these are powerful words if I was
[1:07:56] an evangelist I would preach an hour on
[1:07:59] these next four verses and Jesus stood
[1:08:03] still I don't think it's very often that
[1:08:08] he stands still he's always moving and
[1:08:13] working and carrying out a plan in our
[1:08:17] lives and for us but in his physical
[1:08:19] form he heard the cry everyone crying
[1:08:23] everyone trying to get his attention may
[1:08:26] God give you ears to hear just a moment
[1:08:28] may just strengthen you as you're weary
[1:08:30] and sit there so tired Jesus thou son of
[1:08:35] David have mercy on me it's the first
[1:08:38] time we have in recorded scripture where
[1:08:40] Jesus was called publicly by someone
[1:08:42] else a son thou son of David identifying
[1:08:45] him to be the one who would sit on
[1:08:47] David's throne he was saying more than
[1:08:49] Jesus who who descends from David he was
[1:08:53] saying you're the one who sits on an
[1:08:57] eternal throne you are the Messiah
[1:09:00] you're the savior of Israel by calling
[1:09:04] him the son of David have mercy on me
[1:09:07] and Jesus stood still and commanded him
[1:09:09] to be called and they called the blind
[1:09:11] man saying unto Him be of good comfort
[1:09:13] rise he calleth thee are these the same
[1:09:16] ones are these the same fellows that
[1:09:23] told him Shh behave yourself
[1:09:29] don't you take for one minute that I am
[1:09:33] saying there doesn't need to be a form
[1:09:35] of order but his need his desperation
[1:09:43] forced him to cry out in a non orderly
[1:09:49] fashion have you ever been there you may
[1:09:55] never been there but you may be there
[1:09:58] before this life is over that you don't
[1:10:01] have time to think about protocol or our
[1:10:05] man's expectation you know that in this
[1:10:09] moment his spirit is passing this way
[1:10:13] and you cannot afford to hold your peace
[1:10:18] you feel like I must catch his attention
[1:10:23] he calleth thee be of good comfort rise
[1:10:26] he calleth thee and he you know this
[1:10:29] verse he casting away his garment rose
[1:10:35] and came to Jesus this is so precious
[1:10:40] that word
[1:10:42] that was chosen there the translators
[1:10:46] chose to translate it rose because of
[1:10:49] the context but that word doesn't just
[1:10:52] mean he got up he was once sitting down
[1:10:56] and now they've called him and he gets
[1:10:59] up no no that word is much bigger than
[1:11:03] that
[1:11:03] it's actually a word that that means
[1:11:07] it's it's from the root of a word that
[1:11:11] we have talked about before and a stasis
[1:11:14] and Anastasis is a form of Resurrection
[1:11:18] and and so the writer chose when he was
[1:11:21] writing the story to say more than
[1:11:25] Bartimaeus got up because the Lord was
[1:11:27] calling him he actually was saying and
[1:11:29] there bartimaeus 'as Resurrection began
[1:11:36] he cried out Jesus thou son of David
[1:11:40] have mercy Jesus said bring him to me
[1:11:42] and they said come Bartimaeus you gotta
[1:11:45] go and the rider said and there
[1:11:48] bartimaeus his resurrection began
[1:11:51] hallelujah how many of you believe it
[1:11:54] was a symbolic resurrection for
[1:11:56] bartimaeus the life that he had lived
[1:11:59] presumably from his birth would never be
[1:12:02] lived the same way again
[1:12:05] everything was not about to change
[1:12:08] everything had already changed the
[1:12:14] moment he cried out
[1:12:15] come on the hell he rose casting away
[1:12:25] Apple below apple below it means to
[1:12:31] throw something away to throw something
[1:12:34] aside it comes from a root word below
[1:12:37] and the word below is an object to be
[1:12:41] thrown and this is where we get our word
[1:12:44] ball he was in haste he desired to
[1:12:50] disengage
[1:12:53] to separate himself from every
[1:12:57] impediment from every hindrance he
[1:13:04] wanted to step toward Jesus the way that
[1:13:10] up Apollo is used and the grammar that
[1:13:14] surrounds it and I have to struggle
[1:13:15] depend on others to get it the way the
[1:13:21] grammar is used in the sentence around
[1:13:25] Apollo it tells us that this wasn't not
[1:13:32] only a resurrection but the casting off
[1:13:36] of the garment was a symbol it was a
[1:13:41] message that he was sending that he was
[1:13:47] finished through with his old life you
[1:13:54] don't have to save me a seat this has
[1:14:00] been my spot for all these years I've
[1:14:04] said right there all of these years and
[1:14:08] if you hear brother Branham preaching
[1:14:11] and he's preaching from from what is the
[1:14:15] book prince of the house of David
[1:14:21] brother Branham is preaching from the
[1:14:23] Prince of the house of David when he
[1:14:25] talks about Bartimaeus in his little his
[1:14:27] little sign lamb is little lamb that led
[1:14:29] him around like a dog he's taking that
[1:14:31] story from the Prince of the house of
[1:14:33] David and so if you've got that in your
[1:14:37] mind you hear brother Ram preaching that
[1:14:39] you see him there maybe in your mind
[1:14:41] you'll see the little lamb there I do
[1:14:44] see the little am sitting there he had
[1:14:48] had that same spot it was reserved for
[1:14:50] him nobody took it he he was a permanent
[1:14:54] fixture there but there's something
[1:14:56] about the way this was worded in the
[1:14:58] Greek that it lets us know that he got
[1:15:01] up with such a determination and
[1:15:04] such such a demeanor that everyone knew
[1:15:07] there he was saying don't worry about
[1:15:10] holding my spot I'll never need to come
[1:15:13] and sit there ever again I am through
[1:15:16] with my old life and I'm getting ready
[1:15:21] for a new life in Jesus Christ he
[1:15:26] discarded his outer coat that loose
[1:15:29] outer robe which covered his tunic in
[1:15:33] order to beg during the times of Jesus
[1:15:37] you had to get permission from the
[1:15:40] authorities the right to beg publicly
[1:15:44] required a person to present himself to
[1:15:47] the authorities he had to provide
[1:15:50] documented proof of his or her
[1:15:52] disability if the evidence satisfied the
[1:15:55] requirements of the counsel permission
[1:15:58] would be granted to that individual to
[1:16:00] beg on the public streets of a city a
[1:16:02] beggar was required then to wear a
[1:16:05] distinguishable garment or tunic or
[1:16:08] cloak rather cloak over the tunic that
[1:16:11] served a number of persons purposes
[1:16:13] first the cloak would distinguish an
[1:16:16] individual from all other professions
[1:16:18] and Stations of life it also served to
[1:16:21] validate the legitimacy of one's
[1:16:22] handicap and to assure that he or she
[1:16:25] was unable to make a living any other
[1:16:28] way in the time of Jesus you didn't have
[1:16:30] to be afraid of someone of doing it for
[1:16:33] a profession because they were lazy if
[1:16:37] you saw a beggar sitting on the street
[1:16:39] he was identified by the cloak that went
[1:16:42] over his tunic s-1 having permission to
[1:16:45] be there and you could trust that his
[1:16:47] need was genuine and that it was
[1:16:49] legitimate it served as sort of a
[1:16:51] license to assure that lazy people would
[1:16:54] not take up the vocation of begging and
[1:16:55] impose on the needs of those who were
[1:16:57] truly in need some if some historians
[1:17:00] have even reported that these tunics
[1:17:03] were issued by the government
[1:17:09] instead of giving a paper license which
[1:17:13] we would have emailed to us today some
[1:17:18] historians have said especially in
[1:17:19] certain regions the government the
[1:17:23] council would give a cloak to the beggar
[1:17:27] and that it would be of a certain style
[1:17:31] in a certain color that served to
[1:17:34] identify that person both as unapproved
[1:17:37] bigger and to identify the nature of his
[1:17:43] handicap how many of you have heard
[1:17:47] we've heard this we've expressed this
[1:17:49] before many others have these cloaks
[1:17:53] were every bit as distinctive and easy
[1:17:57] to identify by the common citizen on the
[1:17:59] street as the linen garments that the
[1:18:02] priests wore and they walked to the
[1:18:04] street you knew who they were because of
[1:18:06] the garments they were wearing when you
[1:18:08] saw the beggar on the street
[1:18:09] you not only knew that he was licensed
[1:18:11] to beg but you knew what his handicap
[1:18:13] was maybe it was obvious to tell if
[1:18:15] someone was blind but there were other
[1:18:17] handicaps that were were permitted to
[1:18:19] beg and so it was important a color a
[1:18:22] style a sash something distinguished the
[1:18:28] legitimacy of the beggar and the
[1:18:30] handicapped so when Bartimaeus rose when
[1:18:35] he got up when he cast aside his cloak
[1:18:41] when he decided to lay down a garment
[1:18:44] that he had wore a garment that had
[1:18:47] become his identity he did it not in a
[1:18:52] way I gotta move freer I gotta I gotta
[1:18:54] be able to move so let me get this old
[1:18:56] heavy coat off for me oh no he wasn't
[1:19:00] lightening his load in the natural he
[1:19:03] was lightening his load in the spiritual
[1:19:05] I'm gonna get rid of this thing he did
[1:19:14] that based on faith that he already
[1:19:16] possessed a faith that had been fueled
[1:19:20] by the testimonies that he had heard of
[1:19:23] the Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:19:25] you're still here
[1:19:27] so bartemaeus was making a bold
[1:19:29] declaration in a few moments I'll no
[1:19:32] longer need this tattered and worn old
[1:19:34] cloak I'm no longer a beggar I'm a true
[1:19:38] believer he had no desire no desire to
[1:19:42] be identified any longer that's what he
[1:19:44] had been how easy it is for us to trust
[1:19:50] to depend on what we have been and the
[1:19:56] Lord is calling us why don't you why
[1:20:00] don't you rise why don't you have a
[1:20:02] resurrection not just stand up why don't
[1:20:06] you get up out of your grave come on the
[1:20:10] rut that you've fallen into why don't
[1:20:12] you get up out of that rut and come to
[1:20:15] me and when you come don't bring your
[1:20:19] costume don't bring your blind man's
[1:20:23] cloak don't bring your beggar's license
[1:20:27] trust look at the faith it took look at
[1:20:33] the trust it took he was giving up his
[1:20:36] spot he was giving up his income what
[1:20:42] was he gonna do what kind of job would
[1:20:45] he have anything he wanted to do he can
[1:20:47] see now well not yet but in just a few
[1:20:52] moments he had no doubt it was about to
[1:20:56] be alright if you live in the land of
[1:21:02] what if it don't happen hear me
[1:21:04] if you dwell in the land of what if it
[1:21:08] don't happen you'll always be a beggar
[1:21:12] you'll always be dressed in your
[1:21:15] handicap oh my could I tell you what I
[1:21:18] could help a preacher that would preach
[1:21:20] this to me you'll always be hung up in
[1:21:24] your handicap if you
[1:21:27] use to hear the voice of Resurrection no
[1:21:34] shame no shame you did you did exactly
[1:21:37] what you could do for as long as you
[1:21:41] could do bartimaeus did exactly what he
[1:21:45] could do
[1:21:45] nobody shaming him for his begging
[1:21:49] nobody is shaming him for the handicap
[1:21:52] that he had or the position and station
[1:21:54] of life had put him in but now he has an
[1:21:57] opportunity to rise and he rose casting
[1:22:01] away his garment and he came to Jesus if
[1:22:05] you got something to cast have you got
[1:22:08] have you got a clock that you need to
[1:22:11] lay off I do
[1:22:13] come on have you got something you need
[1:22:16] to trade Jesus is in the trading
[1:22:20] business I tell you the best thing I
[1:22:23] ever did do when I took off they are old
[1:22:26] and put on the new help me be all robust
[1:22:30] dirty all tattered and torn and when we
[1:22:33] used to sing it with the children they'd
[1:22:35] hold their note the old robe was dirty
[1:22:38] or tattered and torn the new robe was
[1:22:42] spotless and had never been warned I
[1:22:46] tell you the best thing I ever to do
[1:22:49] when I take off the old robe when I put
[1:22:52] on the new how many of you know that's
[1:22:55] just the truth I believe the word the
[1:23:03] spirit couldn't be talking to me you
[1:23:05] were exactly who he's talking to
[1:23:09] because every one of us have clothed
[1:23:14] ourselves we have covered ourselves in
[1:23:19] something it has become our security
[1:23:24] it's like a blankie it's the adult
[1:23:30] version of a posse a binky it's what we
[1:23:36] have done to protect ourselves
[1:23:39] [Music]
[1:23:40] because we have been hurt
[1:23:43] you must understand brother-sister
[1:23:46] there's not a person in this room or on
[1:23:50] this stream that hasn't been mortally
[1:23:56] wounded and some of it way before we
[1:24:03] ever came to Jesus but you and I have
[1:24:07] recognized for years the deepest wounds
[1:24:10] that we have taken the hardest knocks
[1:24:14] and hits that we have known and the
[1:24:18] worst kind of hurt in the world is that
[1:24:21] which we receive in the household of our
[1:24:22] friends the betrayals that we have
[1:24:30] experienced and sometimes perceived have
[1:24:37] weighted us down I'm not sure what we're
[1:24:42] waiting on many times the altars are
[1:24:47] open many times you're invited to come
[1:24:50] forward that is your moment that is your
[1:24:54] opportunity to take off another layer
[1:25:00] some of us have found identity in so
[1:25:03] many different things because of the way
[1:25:06] our minds work we have moved from one
[1:25:08] thing to another so quickly that we have
[1:25:11] layers of beggar's coats layers of
[1:25:17] defiled garments and so we we come into
[1:25:23] the presence of the Lord
[1:25:25] desiring to grab them all at one time
[1:25:28] and jerk them all off but sometimes we
[1:25:34] take them off it just seems to be the
[1:25:36] way it happens a layer by layer by layer
[1:25:39] by layer but don't you know God sees
[1:25:42] your heart don't you know he sees your
[1:25:46] desire to make something right with him
[1:25:50] to be free
[1:25:54] how many of you know who matthew henry
[1:25:56] was he wrote a commentary of the Bible
[1:26:01] sometimes it's strong opinion with no
[1:26:06] real basis that's what a commentary is
[1:26:10] so if you find a favorite one that
[1:26:14] doesn't necessarily mean that
[1:26:15] commentator got every verse right thank
[1:26:18] God for a message but Matthew Henry
[1:26:22] wrote this and I found it and I thought
[1:26:24] it was good he said those who would come
[1:26:27] to Jesus must cast away the garment of
[1:26:30] their own sufficiency and must free
[1:26:35] themselves from every weight and from
[1:26:39] the sin that like long heavy garments
[1:26:44] most easily beset s-- them and he refers
[1:26:49] to Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 and here
[1:26:54] it is in the amplified therefore then
[1:26:57] and I'm going to close NOT ever getting
[1:27:03] to what I wanted to give you but it's my
[1:27:06] fault not yours
[1:27:08] my introduction was six pages Hebrews
[1:27:13] 12:1 therefore then since we are
[1:27:16] surrounded by so great a cloud of
[1:27:19] witnesses who have borne testimony to
[1:27:23] the truth
[1:27:24] let us why don't you read it
[1:27:38] deftly and cleverly clings to could it
[1:27:46] be clearer look this way please
[1:27:48] could it be clearer than that verse
[1:27:54] maybe I could have just read that verse
[1:27:56] and we could have been done now and a
[1:27:59] half ago because that sums it up you say
[1:28:06] I I thought I did that when I got saved
[1:28:09] you certainly traded an old man oh I am
[1:28:17] a new creature in Christ I'm a new
[1:28:20] creation in Christ old things
[1:28:23] somebody say old things have passed away
[1:28:27] behold all things have become new
[1:28:32] that's when you're born again to be born
[1:28:35] again means to be born from above how
[1:28:38] many of you know beyond the shadow of a
[1:28:39] doubt that you've been born from above
[1:28:43] amen
[1:28:44] I know I have I know that I've been born
[1:28:48] from above but as we journey you got to
[1:28:54] know it as we journey we pass through
[1:28:59] places that we have never been before
[1:29:01] you listening we carry discouragements
[1:29:11] and hopes deferred and and all the
[1:29:15] things dreams unfulfilled visions
[1:29:19] unrealized healings that have not quite
[1:29:24] manifests it and we pass through strange
[1:29:29] lands where we've never been before and
[1:29:31] we pick up things we just pick up things
[1:29:38] because it's true that people I'm almost
[1:29:40] done it's true that people need
[1:29:43] something to hold in their hands
[1:29:46] we're just kind of made that way and
[1:29:50] they pick up things they say pretty
[1:29:54] things I want you to know when I first
[1:29:56] started doing missionary work and when I
[1:29:58] say missionary work I don't mean
[1:30:00] missionary work I mean when I first
[1:30:02] started going to the nations I've never
[1:30:04] been a missionary I've never gone and
[1:30:07] lived in a foreign land I've gone in and
[1:30:09] tried to be an encouragement and come
[1:30:11] home so I don't want you to think that I
[1:30:13] think I've done a great missionary work
[1:30:15] I hope I can encourage somebody along
[1:30:19] the way I got my email this week we are
[1:30:26] eagerly preparing your arrival for
[1:30:29] Christmas convention this year as per
[1:30:33] our perpetual invitation last December
[1:30:39] maybe we said something to encourage
[1:30:43] those folks but when I first started
[1:30:46] traveling at places like that you all
[1:30:47] know I love trinkets and knickknacks and
[1:30:51] things like that pick up rocks and me
[1:30:57] and Casey Hannah we could be good
[1:30:59] buddies because she loves to go get
[1:31:00] those painted rocks and I like things
[1:31:04] like that she ought to show me take me
[1:31:07] sometimes show me where to get him and I
[1:31:10] would just pick up something in every
[1:31:12] country because we didn't understand
[1:31:16] that many many many times their spirits
[1:31:20] attached they were they they they
[1:31:23] represent things that we don't
[1:31:25] understand their culture is different
[1:31:28] than our culture the worst that it ever
[1:31:30] happened to me brother Greeley knows
[1:31:32] this God has sent him multiple times to
[1:31:34] India he sent me once and I know he sent
[1:31:38] me because I was greatly opposed in
[1:31:40] getting there multiple people prophesied
[1:31:43] to me that I shouldn't go and the Lord
[1:31:44] kept telling me that I must go but I was
[1:31:47] told specifically they took me out for a
[1:31:50] day of luncheon shopping and I was told
[1:31:52] specifically don't take anything from
[1:31:55] this place
[1:31:56] leave it all here and I knew for me for
[1:32:04] that trip an assignment had been sent
[1:32:07] against me I would be attracted to
[1:32:10] something that someone had attached
[1:32:14] something to in the realm of the Spirit
[1:32:15] I don't believe in all that well I'll
[1:32:17] tell you something you don't have to but
[1:32:21] I'm gonna hear him cuz I've made some
[1:32:23] big mistakes I burned I've had to do
[1:32:25] some burning I've had to do some burying
[1:32:29] I've had to do some casting aside me
[1:32:31] have more to do I want to hear his voice
[1:32:35] come on now and so I've had to learn
[1:32:39] that there are times when we pass
[1:32:42] through something and we feel a need to
[1:32:44] have something in our hand we better be
[1:32:46] careful what we pick up because what we
[1:32:49] innocently take in our take on board to
[1:32:54] occupy our hand in mind can be an
[1:32:58] assignment of the enemy against us to
[1:33:01] weigh us down to make us heavy so that
[1:33:07] we accept our present condition as our
[1:33:12] final condition you better tell the
[1:33:15] devil you who listen to me now we
[1:33:17] started coming down here a lot earlier
[1:33:19] you better tell the devil now that your
[1:33:22] condition in this moment is not your
[1:33:25] future condition how you feel right now
[1:33:30] it's not how you plan to feel the rest
[1:33:32] of your journey it doesn't matter how
[1:33:39] much you want to help somebody
[1:33:40] somebody's got to want to help
[1:33:42] themselves and here's the problem some
[1:33:47] people want to re create re reinvent the
[1:33:50] wheel
[1:33:52] God has a provided way croute
[1:33:59] it says provided way cry out if you have
[1:34:06] the if you have the pleasure of lots of
[1:34:09] time and nothing pressing you then go
[1:34:14] find your closet spend a month in a cave
[1:34:20] sorting it out with the Lord but if
[1:34:23] you're like me and you don't have the
[1:34:25] pleasure of having as many years before
[1:34:30] you as you do behind you you may not
[1:34:33] have the luxury of a cave you may not
[1:34:38] have the privilege of a quiet private
[1:34:43] deliverance you may have to be like
[1:34:48] bartimaeus I may have to be like Barnum
[1:34:52] AJ's come on
[1:34:56] thou son of David have mercy on me
[1:35:08] desperation requires when we're driven
[1:35:14] by a passion and the desperation to be
[1:35:16] different than we are at the moment
[1:35:18] sometimes we we break out of order
[1:35:22] we when I say order I mean the order
[1:35:25] we've established for our own demeanors
[1:35:27] you know if people say I'm such a quiet
[1:35:30] I'm not very emotional you know I just
[1:35:32] have to protect listen let me tell you
[1:35:33] something you better throw that robe off
[1:35:40] you know what my message was today I
[1:35:43] preached all of that to get you to
[1:35:48] something that I don't have time to talk
[1:35:49] about now and I promise you I won't but
[1:35:52] I was going I was gonna preach on David
[1:35:57] because he had to lay some stuff aside
[1:36:00] to get free he had done it wrong
[1:36:06] and he couldn't afford to do it wrong
[1:36:07] again he messed up he found a new
[1:36:13] improved way it cost him something
[1:36:16] didn't he couldn't afford to make the
[1:36:19] same mistake so he said this time I'm
[1:36:22] gonna go above and beyond I'm gonna do
[1:36:26] more than I think he would want me to do
[1:36:28] ever six steps we're gonna stop and get
[1:36:31] this right come on God is so good to us
[1:36:40] let's have the musicians to come I'm
[1:36:43] gonna stop
[1:36:54] can't even say I can't even sing the
[1:36:56] song I was gonna sing at the end cuz
[1:36:58] they're gonna sing a song about David we
[1:37:01] didn't preach about David I don't know
[1:37:03] one about bartimaeus except when Jesus
[1:37:10] came the tempters power was broken when
[1:37:18] Jesus came all fear was wiped
[1:37:27] he took the gloom and gave of glory
[1:37:37] all things were changed when Jesus comes
[1:37:44] to stay and in that which I don't know
[1:37:49] and I'm not going to sing is a verse
[1:37:50] about bartimaeus and I can hear Lester
[1:37:54] roll-off singing blind Bartimaeus set by
[1:37:58] the wayside begging his life was one
[1:38:03] limit one one he was locked in to one
[1:38:07] life and then Jesus came walking by and
[1:38:14] he decided it's all or nothing there's
[1:38:21] nothing to come back to I'm giving up my
[1:38:25] spot and I'm giving up my license and
[1:38:28] I'm giving up my blind man's coat and
[1:38:30] I'm gonna launch out and I'm gonna
[1:38:33] believe and it was it was worth the risk
[1:38:38] because Jesus touched him can you give
[1:38:41] us those verses can you find it without
[1:38:43] me going back up it was it was it mark
[1:38:45] 10 we didn't read the last verses I can
[1:38:51] get get them we don't want to leave him
[1:38:55] blind we don't want to leave him blind
[1:39:10] Matt mark 10 and let's look and he
[1:39:16] casting away his garment rose and came
[1:39:20] to Jesus and jesus answered and said
[1:39:23] unto him watch well that I should do
[1:39:26] unto thee the blind man said unto Him
