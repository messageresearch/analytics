[0:51] hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and
[0:54] you're watching the Eagles cry I want to
[0:56] welcome you to the broadcast today and
[0:59] tell you again as we do every week what
[1:01] a privilege it is to be able to speak to
[1:04] you about the things of God about the
[1:06] things that are true the things that are
[1:08] pure the things that are holy the things
[1:11] that are unshakable and that's the
[1:13] revelation of Jesus Christ that is an
[1:17] unshakable Foundation uh it's a
[1:20] foundation that you and I need to be
[1:21] planted on and we need our roots to go
[1:24] down deep deep deep into God's word the
[1:29] scripture tells us
[1:30] that that everything that can be shaken
[1:33] is going to be shaken in the end time to
[1:35] see that which can remain or will remain
[1:39] and uh there is a kingdom we have
[1:42] received a kingdom that cannot be shaken
[1:44] the kingdom of our God the kingdom of
[1:47] the Lord Jesus Christ and it's just a
[1:50] privilege to serve the Lord and I want
[1:52] to thank you for contacting our ministry
[1:54] all the contact information will be
[1:56] given to you on the screen please send
[1:58] in your prayer request EST and your
[2:01] comments just let us know you're
[2:02] watching um I like to tell my kids you
[2:05] know I have four children and um and a
[2:09] host of children in our community of
[2:11] faith and I like to tell them uh where
[2:14] people are watching so if I get an email
[2:16] from uh from Denmark or from the
[2:19] Netherlands or uh India or wherever we
[2:22] hear from precious people I like to to
[2:25] tell my children and they get excited to
[2:27] know that the little broadcast is
[2:29] reaching out all over the world I want
[2:31] to thank God for the gospel channel I
[2:34] want to thank God for Angel TV and any
[2:36] other network out there that's that's
[2:39] really preaching the gospel and making
[2:41] it possible for those who have a burden
[2:44] to to get their message out it's not our
[2:47] message it's the message of the Lord
[2:49] Jesus Christ but we want to get that out
[2:51] to the world and uh I have a i Pastor a
[2:54] small Church Our Community of Faith is
[2:56] not extremely large by any means and uh
[3:00] so it it's really a blessing to be able
[3:02] to to uh have a program on these
[3:05] networks so please pray for them that
[3:08] God will bless them and continue to
[3:10] allow them to expand uh their Outreach I
[3:14] want to continue our study today on the
[3:17] birth pays of the Messiah Jesus in
[3:20] Matthew chap 24:8 talks about uh in that
[3:24] chapter he's talked about some of the
[3:26] signs of of his coming and and the
[3:29] Nearness of the end Etc and in Luke chap
[3:32] 21 also he gives a list of things and in
[3:37] verse 8 it said but all these are the
[3:39] beginning of Sorrows and in many
[3:41] translations we find that the words
[3:44] there uh are the analogy of a woman in
[3:48] the travail of Labor a woman who is
[3:51] about to give birth and we all know that
[3:53] those contractions will grow in
[3:56] frequency and in intensity as the
[4:00] child's coming uh near and so we see
[4:04] this happening in all of the things that
[4:06] our Messiah mentioned the Lord Jesus all
[4:09] of the signs that he spoke about we see
[4:12] those things happening and we do see the
[4:16] frequency and intensity increasing so we
[4:18] know we're nearing the coming of the
[4:21] Lord one of the things that we watch for
[4:24] uh is uh we made a list of the 10 um uh
[4:29] categories I guess would be the right
[4:31] word uh from the words of Jesus uh that
[4:36] contain the birth Pains of the Messiah
[4:38] and we're counting backwards number 10
[4:40] was signs in the sun and the moon and
[4:43] the stars we've covered that number nine
[4:45] was violence upon the whole earth number
[4:48] eight famines pestilences and
[4:50] earthquakes and then on the program last
[4:53] week we started talking about nations in
[4:56] distress with perplexity and Luke chap
[5:00] 21 and verse 25 says and there shall be
[5:04] signs and upon the Earth distress of
[5:07] nations with perplexity and the Sea and
[5:11] the waves roaring now that word
[5:14] perplexity means confusion not having
[5:17] understanding remember the scripture
[5:19] talks about men's Hearts failing them
[5:22] for fear fear of the unknown fear of the
[5:26] things that are happening around them
[5:28] and we as the people of God those who
[5:31] are born again of the spirit of the lord
[5:34] we must not move in fear we must not
[5:37] live in fear in fact we have to operate
[5:39] in the spirit of joy and uh you know
[5:42] even though we see a lot of things going
[5:44] on even God's people being persecuted we
[5:47] have to rejoice and we have to cling to
[5:49] the Lord like never before and not be
[5:53] caught up in the distress of Nations and
[5:55] in the perplexity we ended the broadcast
[5:58] last week by talking about our
[6:00] responsibility as Believers we may feel
[6:03] very very
[6:05] insignificant uh when it comes to what's
[6:08] going on in Nations but we as Believers
[6:11] have a responsibility and the authority
[6:14] that is necessary to pray for Nations
[6:17] and I pray all the time asking for the
[6:20] Nations calling them by name uh I keep a
[6:23] globe in my office I keep a a book of
[6:26] maps near my chair where I pray and and
[6:29] I often go through the globe laying my
[6:33] finger on Nations and asking for them
[6:36] asking that God would bring Revival
[6:38] asking that the Lord would break down
[6:41] the strongholds of Darkness the the
[6:44] predominant spirits that control uh the
[6:47] atmosphere over Nations that God would
[6:50] break the curses that have been placed
[6:52] over Nations because of foolish decis
[6:56] decisions made by government leaders uh
[6:59] do that on a on a regular basis and uh
[7:03] and the enemy does come sometime and say
[7:05] you fool you know who do you think you
[7:07] are but listen I I know who I am I just
[7:10] have to remind myself sometime I'm a son
[7:13] of the most high God and if you're born
[7:16] again you are too and we need to be uh
[7:19] busy uh in prayer and intercession
[7:22] asking for the Nations calling for a
[7:25] shift so that the gospel there are
[7:27] nations right now where the gospel El is
[7:30] really closed uh as far as uh the
[7:34] freedom to to take the gospel everything
[7:37] that goes on in particular Nations is
[7:39] underground and I pray that God will
[7:42] give uh open doors and bless the
[7:45] missionaries and bless those who are in
[7:48] hiding uh risking their lives and some
[7:51] are being martyred every day around the
[7:54] world for the cause of of the Lord Jesus
[7:57] Christ and we have an obligation to pray
[8:00] for their safety and for those who are
[8:02] smuggling the gospel into uh into
[8:05] unfriendly Nations I try to remember
[8:08] them in prayer and one of these days
[8:11] we'll get to shake their hand one of
[8:13] these days we'll get to hug their necks
[8:15] and meet those that have been the
[8:18] beneficiaries of our faithful prayers so
[8:21] don't let the enemy beat you up when it
[8:23] comes to your right to prayer you're
[8:25] being called boldly to the throne of
[8:27] grace in this hour number six in the
[8:31] countdown of the birth Pains of Messiah
[8:34] is false prophets and false teachers
[8:38] Matthew 24: 4 and 5 and Jesus answered
[8:42] and said unto them take heed that no man
[8:45] deceive you for many shall come in my
[8:48] name saying I am Messiah and shall
[8:52] deceive many there's going to be great
[8:56] deception in the world uh and it's going
[9:00] to increase as we move closer to the
[9:03] coming of the Lord there are false
[9:05] teachers and false preachers and false
[9:08] prophets and there are even those who
[9:10] have set themselves up as a Earthly
[9:14] representation of God on the earth and
[9:17] uh you know we we we want to we want to
[9:20] be careful about about putting our
[9:23] confidence and our trust in popes and
[9:25] potentates and uh and and Bishops and
[9:28] and so forth we want our confidence to
[9:31] be in the Lord Jesus Christ and of
[9:34] course we don't want to cast our
[9:35] confidence away from men and women used
[9:38] uh mightily of God but we don't want to
[9:41] be uh conquered uh by by the the man
[9:45] organized structure of today's Church
[9:48] Society either we want to have an ear to
[9:50] hear from the spirit of Truth we want to
[9:53] believe that that God can reveal his
[9:55] word to us and indeed he can and we need
[9:58] to ask him to and we need to position
[10:01] ourselves to hear and to see what the
[10:04] spirit would say to us as individual
[10:06] Believers in this hour thank God I
[10:09] believe there are Apostles and Prophets
[10:11] living today I believe that with all my
[10:13] heart but but even in that as as
[10:16] necessary and as beneficial as it is to
[10:19] get a word from an apostle or a prophet
[10:21] I do want to stress the fact that
[10:23] according to the newer Testament we can
[10:26] hear from God for ourselves if we're
[10:28] filled with the Holy Ghost ghost and so
[10:30] if you get in a place where you're
[10:31] confused and you don't know who to
[10:33] believe or what to believe go down on
[10:35] your knees just lay yourself out before
[10:38] the Lord and say I'm confused I'm
[10:41] perplexed I don't know who to believe I
[10:43] don't know what to believe I need you to
[10:45] send the Holy Spirit to reveal to me the
[10:48] truth of God's word and you know what he
[10:51] will he will do exactly that if we trust
[10:55] him and depend on him to do that uh in
[10:58] in second
[11:00] Timothy 4: 3 and 4 the scripture said
[11:05] for the time will come when they will
[11:07] not endure sound Doctrine but after
[11:10] their own lusts shall they Heap to
[11:13] themselves teachers having itching ears
[11:17] and they shall turn away their ears from
[11:19] the truth and shall be turned unto
[11:21] fables now this is a a time of apostasy
[11:26] and we're living still in a time of
[11:28] apostasy
[11:29] where people are more interested in
[11:32] general uh in having their their their
[11:36] itches scratched uh than they are to
[11:38] hear the truth and and they want to hear
[11:41] something that that promises them
[11:43] prosperity and wealth they want to hear
[11:45] something that says you can uh live any
[11:48] way you want to you know be as drunk as
[11:51] you want to be sleep around as often as
[11:53] you want to but because of Grace it's
[11:56] okay the Lord understands uh so forth
[11:59] and Etc well you can buy into that if
[12:02] you want to but you can't prove that by
[12:04] the word of God and uh if you think you
[12:07] could live any old life and uh and and
[12:10] sin against the truth of God's word and
[12:13] stumble around in unbelief and and
[12:15] because you're a member of the church
[12:17] everything's going to be all right I'm
[12:19] telling you you're wrong in fact you're
[12:21] deceived if you believe that and you
[12:23] need to have your eyes Anointed with Isa
[12:26] you need to take another look at the
[12:28] book and you you need to see what God's
[12:30] word is saying and you need to cut
[12:32] yourself off from those who would teach
[12:35] you those kinds of things that are not
[12:36] according to the scripture God is
[12:39] looking for a people who will surrender
[12:42] their entire lives to him and their
[12:45] decisions will be based on the
[12:47] leadership of the Holy Spirit and not
[12:49] the leadership of the flesh if you
[12:51] follow the desires and lusts of your
[12:54] flesh uh you're certainly not going to
[12:56] draw closer to God you you you you're
[12:59] going to have some temporary pleasure
[13:01] but you're not going to have peace and
[13:03] you're not going to have real Joy the
[13:06] churches in our nation have become uh so
[13:09] many of them have become about
[13:11] entertainment and uh about coffee hour
[13:14] and uh all kinds of things I I mean I
[13:17] don't even like to talk about it I don't
[13:19] like to get into it but um you know um
[13:23] no respect for that which is holy uh no
[13:27] regard uh or ability or discernment it
[13:29] seems like to be able to differentiate
[13:32] between that which is holy and that
[13:34] which is profane I believe the bride of
[13:36] Christ is going to be sharper than a
[13:38] than a knife I believe the bride of
[13:40] Christ is going to be able to discern
[13:43] between good and evil and between holy
[13:45] and profane and we're going to cling to
[13:47] that which is holy and shun that which
[13:50] is profane in fact we're willing to
[13:52] trade some of our churchianity
[13:54] traditions and stand on God's word in
[13:57] this hour because the church has
[13:59] embraced and adopted so many Pagan
[14:02] practices so many Pagan ideas things
[14:05] that have no roots no foundation in
[14:08] scripture and you start coming against
[14:10] some of that and I'm telling you you can
[14:13] cause a lot of trouble in your family or
[14:15] in your church so be careful how you
[14:17] handle the truth that you get a hold of
[14:20] but I want to encourage you to dig a
[14:21] little bit and discover just how far
[14:25] modern-day Christianity has fallen away
[14:28] from its found ation in scripture and uh
[14:31] it might behoove us I think in fact it
[14:33] does to search the scriptures by the
[14:36] help of the Holy Spirit and and search
[14:38] our lives and search the way we have
[14:41] always done things there's one thing we
[14:43] need to know if we always do what we've
[14:46] always done will always be what we've
[14:49] always been and you may be satisfied
[14:52] with that maybe you like what you've
[14:53] been but I don't uh I've dedicated the
[14:56] majority of my life to serving the lord
[14:58] but but I don't like the wasted time
[15:01] there have still been long seasons in my
[15:03] life that feel like I have wasted uh
[15:06] time and I don't like that I want to be
[15:09] busy about the service of the Lord
[15:11] that's one of the reasons why we come to
[15:13] you every week on the Eagles cry we want
[15:15] to sound an alarm I just want to be one
[15:18] voice crying in the wilderness I thank
[15:21] God that there are hundreds and
[15:22] thousands more that God's speaking
[15:24] through in this hour all over the world
[15:28] but I I'm not responsible for their
[15:30] message I'm not responsible for their
[15:32] sphere of influence but I am responsible
[15:36] for the calling that God has placed on
[15:38] my life uh you know I don't I haven't
[15:41] told it in a while here on the broadcast
[15:43] but but I had a visitation when I was
[15:45] just small my first visitation in the
[15:48] spirit realm I was 18 months old
[15:51] somebody said you couldn't possibly
[15:53] remember that well you have a visitation
[15:55] from the Lord and you'll remember it too
[15:58] and then when I was three I had a real
[16:00] encounter with God where my life was was
[16:03] revealed to me and uh my mother is
[16:07] serving the lord today and if you saw
[16:09] her she could tell you that I told her
[16:12] the next morning what I had seen how the
[16:14] Lord had come and what he had said to me
[16:17] and my life has followed the pattern
[16:19] that the Lord described to me when I was
[16:21] three years old and I haven't always
[16:24] pleased him I've made mistakes along the
[16:26] way and I've failed him many many times
[16:29] times but I I love serving the lord and
[16:32] I love following him and I want to spend
[16:35] the rest of my life doing everything I
[16:37] can to encourage God's people you see
[16:40] there's a bride that's being called out
[16:42] in this hour and that bride is just not
[16:46] satisfied with with uh laxidasical
[16:49] Christianity she wants the heart of God
[16:52] she wants to to burn with passion for
[16:56] the truth and uh part truth or false
[17:00] false uh hood is not what she's after
[17:04] she wants the whole truth even if it
[17:07] means that she has to walk away from
[17:09] some of the things that she's walked in
[17:11] Prior uh she now has this moment where
[17:15] the lights are turned on and she said
[17:17] wait a minute you know we can't we can't
[17:19] continue where we've been we've got to
[17:21] get up and move into the higher
[17:23] dimensions of the spirit into the Realms
[17:26] of Glory into that Revelation for one
[17:29] door come up here I want to show you
[17:31] some things see God wants to reveal
[17:34] himself to you because he loves you
[17:36] we're in the the countdown of the birth
[17:38] Pains of the Messiah and we have made it
[17:41] all the way down to this one where we're
[17:43] talking about false uh prophets and
[17:46] false teachers and the fact that people
[17:49] want to have their itches scratched
[17:52] instead of hearing the truth because the
[17:54] truth hurts a little bit sometime but
[17:57] Jesus is the truth to know truth is to
[17:59] know Jesus to know Jesus is to know
[18:02] truth so we need to ask the Lord for
[18:04] discernment to be able to know if we're
[18:08] sitting under uh something that's
[18:10] genuine or if we're sitting under
[18:12] something that's false we need to know
[18:15] we need to have the Discerning of
[18:17] Spirits because we're going to see uh a
[18:21] tremendous
[18:23] increase in false Messiahs and false
[18:26] teaching and false prophets
[18:29] and you know the Bible said in the Old
[18:31] Testament if a prophet prophesies a word
[18:34] in the name of the Lord and it doesn't
[18:35] come to pass he should be stoned now we
[18:38] don't do those kinds of things today but
[18:40] we do need to consider the fact that the
[18:42] prophets that are called of God are not
[18:44] going to be prophesying error they're
[18:46] going to be prophesying thus sayeth the
[18:49] Lord and it's going to come to pass and
[18:52] and we're going to see the word of God
[18:53] how does God interpret his word he
[18:56] interprets his word by bringing to pass
[18:59] so there's been a lot of Hocus Pocus in
[19:02] the in the prophetic and charismatic
[19:04] movement uh and in the Pentecostal world
[19:07] but but we want to move on beyond that
[19:10] and we can't we can't help now uh what
[19:13] has happened many leaders have fallen
[19:16] and and uh lives have ended Ministries
[19:19] have ended in Scandal but we can't be
[19:21] paralyzed by what's happened around us
[19:24] we've got to keep our eyes on the sun
[19:26] you see we're Eagles we're called as
[19:28] Overcomers we're living in the in the
[19:31] last part of of the age where those four
[19:36] uh creatures who released those four
[19:38] creatures Before the Throne Each One
[19:41] releasing an anointing over a a period
[19:44] of seven Church ages of History 2,000
[19:47] years of church history we're now living
[19:50] in the age of the Flying Eagle anointing
[19:53] and uh that that's that age to soar to
[19:56] to go into the place of the spirit to
[19:58] hear the mind of God and to be able to
[20:00] Proclaim it here on the earth and that's
[20:03] what's happening in this hour so don't
[20:05] spend your time spending your wheels
[20:07] with things that are false but ask the
[20:09] Lord to to uh open your eyes and let you
[20:12] see exactly where you are and let's pray
[20:15] for those who the enemy is after in this
[20:18] hour uh you know there I I I saw a
[20:21] documentary not too long ago where
[20:22] thousands of people are flocking to this
[20:25] particular place where a man has
[20:27] proclaimed himself to be the re
[20:28] incarnation of Jesus Christ and and what
[20:31] looks like intelligent people are
[20:33] flocking there by the by the hundreds uh
[20:36] to live in this place of Peace With
[20:39] Jesus don't be fooled by that at all uh
[20:42] we should know better than such a thing
[20:45] the scripture has described what his
[20:47] coming will look like when he comes
[20:49] that's how he's coming and uh so in the
[20:52] second coming when he comes the Bible
[20:54] said every eye shall see him and that's
[20:58] not something somebody living up in a
[20:59] commune somewhere in the Alps or or or
[21:02] up in Northern India or wherever that's
[21:05] that's not the coming of the Lord Jesus
[21:07] Christ we're going to do a study uh in
[21:10] the near future on the threefold uh
[21:12] manner of his coming and where we're
[21:14] going to talk about that that shout and
[21:17] that Trump and that voice of God that's
[21:20] going to wake up uh call for
[21:23] Resurrection in this great Resurrection
[21:26] Rapture or Resurrection catching way uh
[21:29] that is uh exclusively for the bride of
[21:33] Christ not not just anyone who who names
[21:37] religion but those who are truly
[21:40] Overcomers uh let's go to birth pain
[21:43] number five as we count down and that is
[21:47] an increase in uh end time technology
[21:51] the Prophet Daniel spoke about uh when
[21:54] when he was talking when he was getting
[21:55] the scroll and the scroll was to be
[21:57] sealed up Daniel 12:4 but thou oh Daniel
[22:02] shut up the words and seal the book even
[22:05] to the time of the end many shall run to
[22:07] and fro and knowledge shall be increased
[22:11] now this is not always negative uh
[22:13] technology is not always a negative
[22:16] thing the increase of knowledge is not
[22:19] always a negative thing just think about
[22:21] how how amazing technology is today for
[22:26] the advancement of the Gospel I remember
[22:29] when the internet was becoming very
[22:31] popular for Ministries and we uh we we
[22:34] jumped on it we were just a small church
[22:37] but we jumped on it uh that's why we
[22:40] have a we have uh the address web
[22:42] address revival. org because we got in
[22:45] pretty early and so extremely early
[22:48] actually because I could see in the
[22:51] spirit and know that the internet was
[22:54] going to be a a an awful distraction I I
[22:58] knew that it would just be a matter of
[23:00] time that pornography would would would
[23:03] be uh readily available and filth and
[23:06] violence and you know people would begin
[23:09] to learn how to make bombs and
[23:11] everything else on the internet I could
[23:13] see all of that um it's just like
[23:15] television there's so much filth and
[23:17] garbage and Scandal on television but
[23:20] listen God is using the internet and God
[23:25] is using the medium of television to
[23:28] take the true gospel to the Far Corners
[23:32] of the world and so we can't throw the
[23:35] baby out with the bathwater but I think
[23:38] we can clearly say that uh the increase
[23:42] in technology in the past few
[23:45] years is a sure sign that we are nearing
[23:50] the coming of the Lord because Daniel
[23:52] described that in the end of time the
[23:54] last days knowledge would greatly
[23:58] increase increase and we're able to do
[24:00] more I remember purchasing a computer
[24:03] years ago and uh when we did it in in in
[24:07] in tiny little bites of information and
[24:09] I remember somebody saying you'll never
[24:12] use a gigabyte you you would never fill
[24:15] up a gigabyte and now we carry these
[24:18] little devices in our hand that are uh
[24:22] that that are multiple gigabytes and now
[24:24] we're talking about terabytes and things
[24:27] even larger than that
[24:29] and uh I have to delete things off of my
[24:31] children's iPod because they want to
[24:33] download a free game and the and the
[24:36] thing is so full that I have to uh
[24:38] delete something to be able to do it and
[24:41] and it's you know 16 or 32 megabytes or
[24:44] or or gigabytes or whatever um and so we
[24:48] can certainly say uh that that uh
[24:51] knowledge is increasing and that is
[24:54] definitely one of the signs of the
[24:56] coming of the Lord what we want to pray
[24:58] is that not only is natural knowledge
[25:01] increasing and and technology that can
[25:05] can do uh negative things and
[25:08] detrimental things we want to ask the
[25:10] Lord to redeem technology so that it can
[25:13] be used for the advancement of the
[25:15] Gospel think about this this broadcast
[25:18] you're getting it many of you on the
[25:20] internet many of you are getting it by a
[25:22] satellite that's hanging up above the
[25:25] earth and the the broadcast is being
[25:28] teed up to that satellite you pull it
[25:30] down with a satellite dish or a cable
[25:32] box right into your living room and and
[25:36] I'm here in Alabama and and uh we're
[25:39] broadcasting out of out of India out of
[25:43] Iceland and you're getting it wherever
[25:45] you are across Scandinavia across Asia
[25:49] across Europe in the United States
[25:52] you're getting this broadcast I'm
[25:54] telling you I love what the Lord is
[25:57] doing I love the fact that knowledge is
[25:59] increasing I just find it unfortunate
[26:02] that sometimes in the increase of
[26:05] knowledge people leave out God whatever
[26:08] you do don't leave God out of your life
[26:11] we need him and we need him as the old
[26:14] song said if you've ever needed the Lord
[26:17] before you sure do need him now and
[26:20] that's nothing but the truth we need the
[26:23] Lord I'm going to pray for you right now
[26:26] that God will deepen your experience
[26:29] with him that you'll you'll position
[26:31] yourself to experience more of the Lord
[26:36] that you will be free from the trappings
[26:39] of religion and that your heart will
[26:42] burn with a passion for a real
[26:45] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[26:48] there's no peace in the world like the
[26:51] Peace of knowing that we know him and
[26:54] that he knows us and that we're in this
[26:57] thing together protected by the arms of
[27:01] our loving savior who paid such an
[27:03] extreme price let me pray for you now
