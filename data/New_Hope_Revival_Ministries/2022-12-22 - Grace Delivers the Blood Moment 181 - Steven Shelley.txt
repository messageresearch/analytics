Description:
The blood is the very life of God that must be applied to our life for our salvation.  Without the blood we cannot live eternally. However, grace finds us in our sinful condition, finds us in our addictions and filth, and brings us to redemption.  Grace is the vehicle and means of transportation of the blood, so it can cleanse us from all sin and iniquity.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and without the life of God you have an expiration date [Music] but you must understand that without the blood Grace is empty there has to be a prize there has to be a token for Redemption there has to be the shedding of blood so Grace became the transportation it became the truck that got the blood to your house but if the blood had not arrived you are still dead had the blood not gotten to your house you are still lost because the blood is the very life of God and without the life of God you have an expiration date you can't live eternally without the life of God so don't de-emphasize we're not some works by grace but without the shedding of blood there no remission for sins so I want you to understand that Grace was the transportation that got the token price of God's blood to you to you Grace brought it to you in your condition you couldn't have gotten to the blood on your own the blood had to come to you his had to reach farther down than you and I couldn't reach up we could have never gotten to Grace we could have never gotten to the blood but Grace delivered the token life of the blood to you met you right in the gutter he brought you from the gutter most to the uttermost met you right in your sin right in your bondage right in your addiction right in your filth the blood found you there because Grace got it to you so you're saved by grace because you had to get the blood the token price had to get to where you are but do not de-emphasize the power of the blood of God for without that blood there is no hope for salvation
