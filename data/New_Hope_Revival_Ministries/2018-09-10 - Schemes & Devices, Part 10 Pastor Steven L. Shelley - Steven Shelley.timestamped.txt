[0:02] [Music]
[0:09] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right Christ in
[0:43] you the hope a lord
[0:59] hello and welcome to episode 10 in a
[1:03] series that we have entitled schemes and
[1:06] devices we are exposing the enemy his
[1:11] plots and plans against the children of
[1:14] God I am so thankful that the scripture
[1:19] reveals so many different truths about
[1:23] how to be watchful how to be vigilant
[1:27] how to be alert so that we are not taken
[1:31] by surprise at any attempt of the enemy
[1:35] to discourage or to defeat us I'm Pastor
[1:39] Steven Shelley from New Hope revival
[1:42] ministries and we're coming to you in
[1:44] partnership with the gospel channel and
[1:47] I just pray that this series has been a
[1:51] blessing to you and I would have to say
[1:53] that it must have been because we have
[1:56] heard from so many different people who
[1:59] have watched the program and who have
[2:02] taken the time to let us know what a
[2:05] blessing it has been to you and also to
[2:08] share with us your prayer requests and I
[2:12] just covenant with you that I will be
[2:14] faithful to take those prayer requests
[2:17] before the Lord and my faith is no more
[2:20] special than your faith we both have
[2:23] been given as a gift of God faith that's
[2:25] what the scripture tells us but when we
[2:28] join our faith together we become a
[2:32] pretty part powerful team we become
[2:34] partners in faith and I truly believe
[2:37] that when we bind together when we agree
[2:41] together that we can absolutely see the
[2:45] victory that we've been hoping for and
[2:47] longing for so continue to reach out
[2:51] with your prayer requests and let us
[2:54] know if this program in this series has
[2:57] been of a particular blessing in your
[3:00] life and I'd like to say again that any
[3:04] Epis
[3:05] that you missed and I think that every
[3:07] episode has been important and I believe
[3:11] that that you would be blessed and
[3:13] strengthened and encouraged if you would
[3:16] take an opportunity to go back and watch
[3:18] anything that you've missed and you can
[3:21] do that on our YouTube channel and new
[3:25] hope revival ministries you can find it
[3:27] by doing a search on YouTube you can
[3:30] even subscribe to the channel and what
[3:32] that means is you'll be notified when
[3:34] any additional content has been added
[3:38] and I'm just excited about using any
[3:42] method that that is available to help
[3:45] get the truth the gospel and
[3:49] encouragement to the people of God and
[3:51] that's why I'm also so thankful for the
[3:54] gospel channel and I just encourage you
[3:56] to partner with them with your prayer
[3:59] support with your financial support and
[4:02] let's just believe God for great
[4:05] expansion in the area of Christian media
[4:08] all over the world until Jesus comes
[4:12] back and receives his bride and I truly
[4:15] believe that we're living in the end of
[4:17] the end we're living in the last of the
[4:20] last days and I believe that there are
[4:23] going to be beautiful demonstrations of
[4:26] God's love and God's power on planet
[4:30] earth I know that things are dark out
[4:32] there but I'm so thankful that when the
[4:36] world around us is getting darker it's
[4:38] time for the people of God to arise and
[4:41] shine and let the glorious light of the
[4:44] gospel of Jesus Christ reach out from
[4:47] our lives to a world that needs hope and
[4:51] needs help and you and I as believers we
[4:54] have the hope and we have the help
[4:57] through Jesus Christ that the world
[4:59] needs I want us to go to our study today
[5:03] when we were together the last time in
[5:07] episode 9 we ended our program the
[5:11] teaching from that particular episode
[5:14] with a verse of scripture that I have
[5:16] always found to be
[5:18] particularly sad it's in second Timothy
[5:20] chapter 4 in verse 10 where the Apostle
[5:24] Paul says for demas hath forsaken me
[5:28] having loved this present world and the
[5:32] word that is used for world there is a
[5:35] word that means the age the time frame
[5:39] and so we could say that the scripture
[5:43] could redeem us have forsaken me having
[5:45] loved this present age and I want you to
[5:49] know that the love of the world to love
[5:52] the world to love the age that you're
[5:55] living in to embrace the spirit of this
[5:58] last age is a very very dangerous place
[6:02] for people to live in this hour there
[6:07] are so many things that the scripture
[6:09] speaks to us about in not loving the
[6:12] world we're in the world but as children
[6:15] of God as children of the light we are
[6:18] not of this world our citizenship is in
[6:22] a higher place and years ago we used to
[6:27] have a song that said I'm a citizen of
[6:30] two worlds and it's hard to choose
[6:33] between them but I want you to know as
[6:35] the day's grow as we move along and we
[6:39] see what's happening around us in the
[6:41] world it's getting easier and easier to
[6:44] choose our other citizenship to choose
[6:48] the other world the one where we are
[6:51] going by salvation by grace from Jesus
[6:56] Christ and salvation through his blood
[6:59] we have the opportunity to go to that
[7:02] other place to live for all eternity
[7:06] with the Lord you know I know there are
[7:09] people who still struggle to believe
[7:11] such a thing but the Bible tells us that
[7:14] if in this life only we have hope we are
[7:18] of all men most miserable I want to tell
[7:21] you today wherever you're watching this
[7:23] program my hope is not in this world my
[7:28] hope is in the law
[7:29] Jesus Christ my hope is in the Word of
[7:33] God and I believe that there is victory
[7:37] and deliverance available for you in
[7:41] your life right now one of the things
[7:44] that we do to position ourselves to
[7:47] receive what God has for us in this hour
[7:50] is to make sure that we are not in love
[7:53] with this world we are in love with
[7:57] Jesus Christ and we are pursuing him and
[8:00] his destiny purpose and plan for our
[8:04] future I want to read a portion of
[8:07] Scripture as we get started today it's
[8:10] found in Philippians chapter 3 beginning
[8:14] in verse 17 and I'll read all the way to
[8:17] verse 21 and I'm going to read it today
[8:20] from the amplified bible brethren
[8:23] together follow my example and observe
[8:28] those who live after the pattern we have
[8:33] set you this was the Apostle speaking to
[8:38] the people asking them to make sure that
[8:42] they follow the example and the pattern
[8:45] that has been set before them for there
[8:49] are many of whom I have often told you
[8:53] and now tell you even with tears who
[8:57] walk live as enemies of the cross of
[9:01] Christ The Anointed One they are doomed
[9:05] and their fate is eternal misery
[9:07] perdition their God is their stomach
[9:10] their appetites their sensuality and
[9:14] they glory in their shame siding with
[9:18] earthly things and being of their party
[9:23] this is what happened to Dimas he fell
[9:26] in love with the spirit of his age
[9:30] instead of falling in love with the
[9:33] Messiah with the Lord Jesus Christ he
[9:36] followed the appetites of the world the
[9:41] senshu
[9:42] and the lust for the things of the world
[9:45] instead of for the things of God verse
[9:48] 20 but we are citizens of the states the
[9:53] Commonwealth the homeland which is in
[9:57] heaven and from it all so we earnestly
[10:01] and patiently await the coming of the
[10:06] Lord Jesus Christ the Messiah a savior
[10:09] who will transform and fashion anew the
[10:14] body of our humiliation to conform to
[10:17] and be like the body of his glory and
[10:21] majesty by exerting that power which
[10:25] enables him even to subject everything
[10:30] to himself all what powerful words we
[10:35] are left with in this verse of scripture
[10:37] that even our body this lowly body that
[10:42] we live in here this body of humiliation
[10:46] will be totally transformed and
[10:51] fashioned after his glorious body and in
[10:56] his majesty by exerting that power which
[11:00] enables him even to subject everything
[11:04] to him selves we are citizens of another
[11:08] homeland I want you to remind yourself
[11:10] of that when when the spirit of this age
[11:14] is wearing on you if it's pulling to you
[11:18] you know maybe sometime it's not the
[11:20] pull of the spirit of the age it's the
[11:23] heaviness looking around and seeing so
[11:27] much darkness can be a heavy weight upon
[11:30] you but I want you to know it is
[11:32] important that we keep our eyes on the
[11:35] Lord Jesus Christ
[11:37] the scripture tells us that if we put
[11:40] our shoulder to the plow and we look
[11:43] back that he has no pleasure in us it's
[11:47] better that we not make a vow than to
[11:50] make a vow and break
[11:52] that Val so I want to encourage you
[11:55] today if you feel like that you have
[11:58] fallen into a backslidden condition if
[12:01] you are no longer pressing toward Christ
[12:04] but you're just sort of coasting along
[12:07] or maybe sliding backward it is not too
[12:11] late for you to stand firm and know
[12:15] where you're standing and take God at
[12:18] His Word to ultimately see the enemy's
[12:22] access to your life cut off I believe
[12:25] that you and I as children of God can
[12:29] find a place in Christ where we
[12:32] recognize who we are and whose we are
[12:37] and we greatly limit the devil's access
[12:41] to be able to touch us we were recently
[12:44] studying together putting on the helmet
[12:48] of salvation in hope and I want to
[12:50] encourage you to continue to do that
[12:54] that your thoughts that your mind would
[12:57] be guarded dig into God's Word by the
[13:01] spirit and let God give you the
[13:04] ammunition that you need to defeat the
[13:07] works of darkness that would move
[13:10] against your life in this hour when we
[13:13] make up our minds that we are not going
[13:16] to be enticed we are not going to be
[13:19] allured by this present age we can know
[13:24] for sure
[13:25] that God will reward us for standing
[13:29] against the spirit of this age when we
[13:32] start making a stand to be different to
[13:36] swim against the current you know if
[13:39] it's if it's popular oftentimes if it's
[13:42] popular it's not godly I'm not saying
[13:45] every time but I'm saying the scripture
[13:48] tells us follow not a multitude to do
[13:51] evil to send the scripture also says
[13:55] though hand join in hand the wicked will
[13:58] not go unpunished so just because the
[14:01] majority is doing it just because
[14:04] the majority says it's alright there's
[14:07] no harm in that doesn't mean that it's
[14:10] good for you and it doesn't mean that
[14:13] it's what God has for your life you know
[14:16] I don't want to settle for second-best I
[14:19] don't want to settle for for a
[14:21] permissive will I want to know that I am
[14:26] walking in the fullness of my purpose my
[14:30] why the reason why I was born when we
[14:35] come to that place of having that desire
[14:39] and pouring that out before the Lord I
[14:42] truly believe that he honors that I
[14:45] believe that he will bless us in that
[14:48] when we set our affection on things
[14:51] above and not on the things of this
[14:54] earth when we make up our mind I'm not
[14:57] going to follow the world I'm not going
[14:59] to follow the fad I'm not going to just
[15:02] go with the flow but I'm gonna take a
[15:04] stand for truth for biblical truth for
[15:08] righteousness for holiness when we do
[15:11] that we begin to catch a vision of our
[15:15] heavenly citizenship you know I I grew
[15:18] up in a little old-time Pentecostal
[15:21] church and life was hard I've shared
[15:24] that with you before life was hard for
[15:27] these old Saints they worked very hard
[15:30] we our church was in a textile area and
[15:35] I tell you the work in the textile mill
[15:38] was hard work even the sisters even some
[15:43] of the ladies worked on those big old
[15:46] cotton looms and they were making
[15:48] hosiery or making denim a lot of denim
[15:52] was made in our area and those shuttles
[15:56] would would fly back and forth in those
[15:58] looms and sometimes they would shoot out
[16:01] and hit people in the head or the arm
[16:03] and sometimes those men and women would
[16:06] come in literally bruised from their
[16:09] jobs and sometimes even greater
[16:11] accidents would take place in those
[16:14] cotton mills and times were a little bit
[16:17] hard and but I want you to know I would
[16:20] often as a little boy sit on the front
[16:23] row of the church and I would watch
[16:26] those Saints gather around the piano
[16:28] that's the way it was done there was an
[16:31] acquire with robes or anything like that
[16:33] but in the corner an upright piano and
[16:36] that's what they call the choir so to
[16:38] speak
[16:39] the piano player would start playing and
[16:41] the song leader would start and and some
[16:44] of the saints not all of them but a
[16:46] handful of them would gather behind the
[16:49] piano and they would just sing
[16:51] there was no choir practice there was no
[16:54] reading of the music they just sung they
[16:58] just opened their mouths and let it fly
[17:01] and I want you to know the look that the
[17:05] transformational look that would come
[17:07] over their faces when they began to sing
[17:10] of another place oh I want to see him
[17:14] look upon his face there to sing forever
[17:19] of his saving grace on the hills of
[17:23] glory let me lift my voice cares all
[17:27] past home at last ever to rejoice in
[17:32] that moment the look of the changed look
[17:37] that would come over their face and they
[17:39] would sing with everything that was
[17:41] within them because in that moment they
[17:44] were not focused on their problems they
[17:47] were not focused on family issues they
[17:50] weren't focused on bills that were due
[17:52] they were focused on another home
[17:55] another place jesus said I I go away to
[18:01] prepare for you a place and if I go away
[18:05] I will return unto you again and receive
[18:09] you to myself that where I am there you
[18:14] may be also
[18:15] I believe that I still believe in those
[18:18] words of Jesus and I believe like those
[18:21] old Saints gathered around the piano
[18:23] that the more often we can get our minds
[18:27] on the other citizenship the land
[18:31] of our origin the land of our future the
[18:36] eternal home of the soul I believe the
[18:40] more often we can put our mind on that
[18:42] we are lifted up out of the
[18:46] circumstances and the depressions of
[18:49] life and it causes us to be less and
[18:53] less eluard by the things of this
[18:57] present age by the world around us we
[19:00] used to sing another song in the church
[19:03] I grew up in I don't want to get
[19:06] adjusted to this world and truly this is
[19:10] one of the keys to pressing in in times
[19:15] like the ones we're living in now to
[19:19] make sure that we don't get lulled to
[19:23] sleep by the present age that we don't
[19:27] become lukewarm because so many around
[19:30] us are lukewarm but we keep our eyes on
[19:34] Jesus Christ and in doing so we're
[19:39] remembering our other citizenship the
[19:42] home of the soul as we said a moment ago
[19:44] and and I really believe it's in that
[19:47] moment that we find the strength and we
[19:50] find the hope to keep pressing in and I
[19:52] believe we're strengthened by that
[19:54] against a lot of the things the enemy
[19:57] would throw our way to pull us or to
[20:00] attract us citizenship has rights and
[20:04] privileges as a citizen we're given free
[20:07] access to enter and exit our respective
[20:10] country so as citizens of another land
[20:14] as citizens of another home we have
[20:16] certain rights and privileges as we read
[20:19] just a moment ago in in this verse of
[20:22] scripture in Philippians even in a
[20:25] foreign land the citizen is granted
[20:27] special privileges and immunities due to
[20:30] the nation of which they are a citizen
[20:34] the second benefit of being delivered
[20:36] from this present age is that we live
[20:40] with an expectation of Christ's return
[20:44] we
[20:45] not be like Dimas we must not get our
[20:49] eyes on this present world but we must
[20:53] realize that we have a promise a blessed
[20:57] hope we have the the truth that the Lord
[21:01] Jesus Christ is coming back to receive
[21:05] those that are his those that are
[21:08] looking for him the complete Jewish
[21:11] Bible takes this verse and translates it
[21:15] like this and it is from there that we
[21:19] expect a deliverer the Lord Yeshua the
[21:24] Messiah verse 21 he will change the
[21:28] bodies we have in this humble state and
[21:32] make them like his glorious body we not
[21:38] only have a promise for the soul the
[21:40] spirit but we have a promise for this
[21:43] physical body we'll never be able to
[21:46] look with excitement for the Lord's
[21:49] return until we have truly been
[21:51] delivered from this present evil age the
[21:55] enemy will use anything he can to get
[21:58] you focused on the world around you
[22:00] he'll use entertainment he'll use pop
[22:03] culture he'll use popular music he'll do
[22:07] anything and everything he'll make it
[22:09] shine you know so many young people have
[22:14] been born with god-given gifts that
[22:17] could have been used to to build the
[22:20] kingdom of God to advance the purposes
[22:22] of Christ and yet the enemy was hanging
[22:26] around with his glitz and glitter and he
[22:30] was able to attract them in the same
[22:33] manner that he attracted Dimas and what
[22:36] a tragedy it is when God given gifts are
[22:41] used to serve sin to serve the enemy
[22:46] instead of serving God I just want to
[22:49] remind you I want to exhort you and
[22:52] encourage you because I love you don't
[22:55] get adjusted to this world
[22:57] don't allow the
[22:59] popular trends of immorality the
[23:06] blurring of the gender lines all of the
[23:09] things that are happening around us look
[23:11] God's Word is our pattern God's Word is
[23:16] our absolute truth in that word he
[23:20] defines and emphasizes the sanctity of
[23:24] life in this word he defines what God's
[23:29] idea of marriage and morality looks like
[23:33] and it may seem archaic in a world that
[23:37] has really forgotten and forsaken God
[23:41] but but to us to the citizens of light
[23:45] to the citizens of another Kingdom
[23:48] I'd rather align my life with this word
[23:52] and know that I have hope of a better
[23:55] world of another place of an eternity
[23:58] with him than to relax myself and fall
[24:03] into the popular way of the world around
[24:06] me be alert by this present age and and
[24:10] gamble with my own soul
[24:13] you know the Bible talks about the value
[24:16] of the soul and really our soul is the
[24:21] most valuable thing that we possess our
[24:24] our inner man is the most valuable thing
[24:27] that we really own it's not our
[24:29] possessions it's not our properties it's
[24:33] not our automobiles it's really the
[24:36] inner man and I think that we should
[24:40] really learn to value what God has given
[24:44] us in our spirit being we can feed that
[24:49] man by the Word of God I want you to
[24:52] know the spirit man that that spirit
[24:55] being on the inside of us it's not
[24:58] nourished by the things of the world
[25:00] it's not nourished by the sloppy
[25:04] entertainment of Hollywood oh no it's
[25:07] only
[25:08] strengthened and nourished by the pure
[25:11] meat of God's Word and you know as
[25:14] Christians there comes a time that we
[25:18] are weaned from the milk of the word and
[25:20] we begin to dig our teeth into the meat
[25:24] of God's Word and I think it's only the
[25:27] depth the meat of God's Word that's
[25:29] going to sustain us in such an hour as
[25:32] the one that we're living in right now
[25:34] as long as we're in love with the world
[25:37] we will never long for the coming of the
[25:39] Lord Jesus Christ but when we begin to
[25:42] divorce ourselves from the allure from
[25:46] the pull of this present age then we
[25:49] have more room in our life to begin to
[25:53] fall in love with what is on the other
[25:56] side and put our focus on that I
[25:59] remember one of God's great servants
[26:02] telling the story of being in a zoo with
[26:06] his son and it was such a wonderful
[26:09] experience for his little boy to be able
[26:13] to see all the amazing animals and it
[26:16] was a little bit sad that they were
[26:18] contained and that they were in cages
[26:20] but but the joy of being able to
[26:23] interact with them and and see them was
[26:26] was mostly worth understanding that the
[26:30] animals were not free to roam but then
[26:33] they came to the display of the eagle
[26:35] That Bird that was built for the heights
[26:39] and this great servant of God began to
[26:43] describe the look the faraway look in
[26:47] the eye of that eagle who was contained
[26:51] he wasn't born to hop around in a cage
[26:55] he wasn't even born to live in an in an
[26:58] aviary he was born for the sky to be
[27:03] free in fact in our nation the American
[27:07] Bald Eagle is the symbol of freedom and
[27:09] the symbol of Liberty and you know you
[27:12] and I as children of God we're like that
[27:15] eagle we weren't born to become
[27:18] formed to this world we weren't born to
[27:21] be contained and restricted and held
[27:24] back into this world or owned by the
[27:26] world around us we were born to be free
[27:30] we were born to soar through the sky we
[27:34] were born to express our love our
[27:36] devotion our appreciation to the Lord
[27:39] Jesus Christ and to point others to the
[27:42] light of the truth of the gospel when
[27:45] we're beginning to examine some of the
[27:49] strongholds that the enemy likes to have
[27:52] over our life and we have studied some
[27:54] of those thus far in this series it's
[27:59] tempting sometime to focus on what we
[28:04] see instead of the root cause it's often
[28:11] that way in medicine we go to the doctor
[28:14] we tell him all of our symptoms what
[28:18] we're experiencing and he prescribes for
[28:22] us medication that more often helps us
[28:26] with the symptom and we take that for a
[28:30] while and another symptom pops up and we
[28:33] take that he we take another bit of
[28:35] medicine and another and we go back and
[28:38] so they changed the medicine and and and
[28:41] things change but maybe sometime they're
[28:44] never really getting completely better
[28:46] and there's a reason for that it's
[28:49] because there's a root behind the
[28:53] condition we've got to find out what the
[28:56] root problem is what is the root cause
[28:59] of what we're experiencing now and we
[29:03] want to deal with that it's not just the
[29:07] fruit but it's the root we've got to go
[29:11] down and find out through discerning of
[29:14] spirits
[29:15] what is the root of this attack where
[29:19] did this originate where have I opened
[29:22] up a door for the enemy to be able to
[29:25] capture not so much of my attention in
[29:28] this manner the Bible tells us in
[29:30] Galatia
[29:31] ian's chapter 5 verses 22 and 23 but the
[29:36] fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace
[29:40] long-suffering gentleness goodness faith
[29:44] meekness temperance against such various
[29:50] no law I would say that every believer
[29:52] watching this teaching today knows those
[29:56] two verses of Scripture as the fruit of
[29:59] the Spirit and there's no doubt in my
[30:02] mind that's exactly what it is when we
[30:06] are filled and refilled with the Spirit
[30:10] of God these are the expressions of that
[30:14] spirit in filling in our life we should
[30:18] be expressing love joy peace
[30:22] long-suffering gentleness goodness
[30:25] meekness temperance faith against such
[30:29] there's no law these are the fruit of
[30:32] the Spirit on a trees outermost regions
[30:36] are branches and these branches are
[30:40] connected to to a main component of that
[30:43] tree or the main trunk of the tree the
[30:47] trunk is supported firmly beneath the
[30:51] soil by roots all of us know this if
[30:55] anything happens to the root system of
[30:59] that tree guess what happens the whole
[31:03] tree dies the tree can sometimes sustain
[31:08] damage to the limb to the trunk and
[31:11] still survive but if the roots are
[31:15] damaged if the roots are destroyed then
[31:19] over a period of time the entire tree
[31:23] dies if if only the addiction is dealt
[31:27] with in somebody's life then the help is
[31:32] not complete many many times in order
[31:36] for someone to walk in freedom from
[31:39] addiction it's important to understand
[31:42] that behind that
[31:44] addiction to alcohol to drugs to
[31:47] pornography to whatever the addiction is
[31:50] to food whatever the addiction is it's
[31:54] important to discover that behind that
[31:57] addiction there is always a root cause
[32:01] and so that addicted person can go
[32:06] through all kinds of rehab and all kinds
[32:10] of programs and can most often find
[32:15] relief but temporary relief why because
[32:20] the trunk of the tree the branches of
[32:23] the tree are being dealt with but the
[32:26] root is not being ministered to or
[32:29] health is not being provided for the
[32:33] root we're not finding what is the
[32:35] origin what is the cause and more times
[32:39] than not rejection is the root of the
[32:44] spirit of addiction many people fall
[32:48] into addiction it's not what they set
[32:51] out to do it's not what they set out to
[32:53] be it doesn't control their life in the
[32:57] beginning they still have the control
[33:00] most often they're able to to enjoy that
[33:05] addiction whatever it is and turn it on
[33:09] and turn it off in the sense that I'm
[33:12] getting the the charge or the thrill
[33:15] from the alcohol or from the drugs but
[33:17] yet I have to get up in the morning and
[33:19] go to work
[33:19] so I limit myself or I know I know just
[33:22] you know how much I can drink and still
[33:25] get up and be able to function
[33:26] I mean people begin to learn how to sort
[33:29] of turn that thing on and off but when
[33:31] addiction is not dealt with at the root
[33:34] this attraction and this compulsion to
[33:38] those things that will only destroy us
[33:41] in the end then it becomes
[33:44] uncontrollable and instead of you
[33:48] controlling the addiction or the
[33:50] substance it controls you does that make
[33:54] any sense
[33:55] to anyone watching this program
[33:58] I believe that most every person
[34:00] watching me today your family your life
[34:03] has in some way been touched by that
[34:07] spirit of addiction the route is often
[34:11] rejection but there is always a deeper
[34:15] problem behind the the habit or the
[34:19] abuse of a substance
[34:21] therefore the addiction is not the root
[34:23] of the problem the problem lies in the
[34:27] root it's like cutting a branch or
[34:29] pulling a leaf off of a tree branches
[34:32] grow back leaves grow back these spirits
[34:35] will just strengthen and the addiction
[34:38] will get stronger and you will lose
[34:41] control of this other spirit that begins
[34:45] to take ahold of your life so if you
[34:48] only treat the addiction or you only
[34:50] treat the symptom it's very likely that
[34:53] it will come back but the problem must
[34:56] be it can be and it must be dealt with
[35:01] on the root level the Bible tells us in
[35:05] in the words of Jesus in Matthew chapter
[35:08] 12 verse 33 either make the tree sound
[35:14] healthy and good and it's fruit sound
[35:18] healthy and good or make the tree rotten
[35:21] diseased and bad and it's fruit rotten
[35:24] deceased and bad for the tree is known
[35:28] and recognized and judged by its fruit
[35:33] it's very very possible to allow the
[35:39] holy spirit to reveal to us the root of
[35:44] the problem we were talking about
[35:48] recently how dabbling in in certain
[35:52] areas of the new age or of the occult
[35:55] can open up our lives to the demonic
[35:59] there are many many things that the
[36:03] enemy is watching over if he can capture
[36:06] your attention by some of those things
[36:10] my old granny
[36:11] used to say it's not the it's not the
[36:14] first pint of whiskey but it's the first
[36:17] drop that begins to make the alcoholic
[36:21] now I know there are many people that
[36:23] don't believe that kind of a statement
[36:26] but in reality it's more true than we
[36:30] care to admit the enemy watches over
[36:33] these things he entices us toward those
[36:36] things not for the purpose of relaxing
[36:40] us oh no that's not his purpose that may
[36:43] be what it serves in our lives
[36:45] temporarily but the enemy desires to
[36:49] take that very thing that once brought
[36:52] you a few minutes of relief or
[36:54] relaxation or you helped you deal with
[36:57] your stress the enemy desires to take
[36:59] that very same thing and control your
[37:02] life with it I really really believe
[37:07] that if we can fill our lives with the
[37:11] love of Jesus Christ if we can fill our
[37:15] our minds with the truth of God's Word
[37:18] we have the power and the ability to
[37:22] choke out any thought that the enemy
[37:26] tries to plant in our heart any
[37:29] addiction that the enemy wants to drag
[37:31] us into sometimes we have to muster all
[37:36] the strength we have as a human being
[37:38] and then it's still not enough to break
[37:41] ourselves free we call on the name of
[37:44] the Lord we ask God for deliverance to
[37:48] break every chain and when you're
[37:51] praying for your loved ones the whole
[37:53] purpose of even bringing this out to you
[37:55] today it's when you're praying for your
[37:58] loved ones don't just pray about the
[38:01] fruit don't just pray about the mess of
[38:03] life that you see them living and what
[38:06] you see them dealing with on the surface
[38:08] but why don't you begin to ask the
[38:10] Spirit of God to go down to the root of
[38:14] the problem to deal with the rejection
[38:16] to deal with the
[38:18] bitterness to deal with the resentment
[38:21] to go down into the deepest part of who
[38:24] that person is and began to minister his
[38:28] love I want you to know the love of
[38:32] Jesus Christ is the remedy for all
[38:35] rejection mentality for all the
[38:38] bitterness for all the woundedness for
[38:41] everything that is wrong in your life or
[38:45] in the life of your loved ones the love
[38:48] of Jesus it doesn't just neutralize what
[38:52] the enemy is doing it absolutely can
[38:55] cancel it can cut it out like a cancer I
[39:00] believe in in deliverance let's just
[39:04] call it what it is
[39:05] I believe in deliverance I believe that
[39:08] there's power in the Word of God there's
[39:11] power in the truth of who God is by the
[39:14] Spirit of God we have power to break
[39:17] yokes to see our loved ones set free
[39:22] sometimes we think well if I can get
[39:24] them in a different environment if I if
[39:27] I can get them to another preacher if I
[39:30] can listen it's deeper most of the time
[39:35] it's deeper than that let's pray about
[39:37] the route if you're needing healing
[39:41] today let's not just pray about the
[39:43] symptoms let's pray about the root of
[39:46] the disease of the infirmity hi I'm
[39:50] gonna say something that a lot of people
[39:52] may not completely agree with but even
[39:57] medical science is beginning to tell us
[40:00] that oftentimes what we see manifesting
[40:05] in our physical body as sickness is the
[40:08] result of something going on on a much
[40:12] deeper level in our human emotions what
[40:16] in the world are you saying preacher one
[40:19] minute you sound old-fashioned and then
[40:22] the next minute you you're talking hocus
[40:24] pocus but no friend this isn't
[40:27] hocus-pocus at all what what
[40:30] researchers are finding out is that we
[40:34] hold onto our wounds and we hold onto
[40:36] our hurts and we hold on to some of the
[40:39] ways that we have been mistreated and
[40:42] abused in life we never get it dealt
[40:45] with we never really bring it to the
[40:48] love of Jesus Christ and submit it under
[40:51] the blood and and and and become set
[40:54] free from from that past we hold on to
[40:58] it not really understanding how to move
[41:00] beyond it and that in itself can begin
[41:06] to have a very serious effect on the
[41:10] physical body we know that many diseases
[41:13] have emotional roots now that doesn't
[41:17] mean that it's in someone's mind and and
[41:20] they're not really sick that's not what
[41:22] I'm saying at all that's another issue
[41:24] altogether I'm talking about real
[41:26] infirmity real sickness that's caused
[41:30] from an emotional problem or a spiritual
[41:34] problem but I have good news for you
[41:37] there's not a case that's too difficult
[41:40] or too complicated for the Lord Jesus
[41:43] Christ he knows how to heal us on every
[41:48] level of who we are not just our
[41:51] physical body but he knows how to heal
[41:53] us at the root of our condition the root
[41:57] of rejection can usually be dealt with
[42:00] in your life by a decision to forgive
[42:04] there is such power in forgiveness the
[42:09] enemy would never be able to use that
[42:11] root of rejection in your life again if
[42:14] you could find the strength if you can't
[42:16] find it in yourself find it in the Lord
[42:19] find it in the truth that he has
[42:22] forgiven you of so much if Jesus can
[42:27] forgive us from so much so much
[42:31] rebellion so much sin so much unbelief
[42:35] all the things that we may have
[42:39] gun committed in our past life and yet
[42:42] he just forgives us his love reaches
[42:45] deeper than that
[42:47] his blood is able to wash every bit of
[42:50] that away and we didn't deserve
[42:52] forgiveness in fact we were forgiven
[42:55] before we asked we asked because that's
[42:58] how we receive but it was already done
[43:01] if we can sometimes remember that that
[43:06] we were unworthy of this forgiveness but
[43:09] God so freely provided it for us why
[43:14] because he loved us
[43:16] sometimes in reminding ourselves of that
[43:19] forgiveness the Bible even says that to
[43:23] the one who is forgiven much love it
[43:27] much there's just something about
[43:29] knowing I am forgiven that helps give me
[43:33] power to forgive other people I truly
[43:37] believe that a lot of this root of
[43:40] rejection in Our Lives can be ministered
[43:43] to it can be abolished it can be cut out
[43:47] of our life if we make a choice a
[43:50] decision to forgive those who have
[43:54] rejected us I truly believe that we can
[44:00] make a decision to lay down bitterness
[44:02] to lay down resentment to lay down
[44:05] judgment how could you make it sound so
[44:08] easy preacher because we're not doing it
[44:11] by ourselves we don't have to do this on
[44:14] our own we don't even have to forgive
[44:16] those who have wronged us on our own did
[44:19] you know you can ask the Lord I know
[44:21] because I've experienced it in my own
[44:25] life when I didn't have power strength
[44:29] grace goodness whatever is necessary to
[44:33] forgive those who had wronged to me I
[44:35] found the strength that I needed to
[44:38] forgive by calling on the Lord for His
[44:41] grace for his strength for his love for
[44:44] his power in that amazing it's amazing
[44:48] that he is for us not against us
[44:52] and that everything we need to deal with
[44:55] every issue in our life he provides if
[44:58] we ask you don't have to be ashamed to
[45:02] say Lord I cannot forgive him I in my
[45:05] own strength I cannot make myself
[45:07] forgive that person who's so wrong to me
[45:11] who so abused me who so took advantage
[45:14] of me but I am asking you for for
[45:18] strength to forgive I'm asking you for
[45:21] grace to forgive and you know what often
[45:24] happens he pours out his love toward you
[45:27] you begin to feel the love of God
[45:30] towards you and when you do it makes it
[45:33] so much easier forgiveness is not about
[45:36] setting the other person free anyway
[45:38] it's about setting you free if that
[45:42] person in your life whoever they are if
[45:46] they're still involved in your life or
[45:48] if it's a part of your distant past if
[45:51] you'll call on the Lord I believe he'll
[45:54] help you get to the root of the problem
[45:56] and I believe he'll give you the love
[45:58] and grace that you need to be completely
[46:01] set free in the absence of forgiveness
[46:04] the person can never go free they may
[46:07] get a temporary fix but the addiction
[46:10] will come back the habit will come back
[46:12] the substance abuse will come back and
[46:15] sometimes it will even get worse when
[46:18] you treat the root of the tree you're
[46:21] treating the fruit when you treat the
[46:24] root when the root gets healthy the tree
[46:27] becomes healthy and the fruit that is
[46:30] produced from the tree becomes healthy
[46:33] and when we begin to look at the root of
[46:36] different issues in our life there's a
[46:38] scripture that talks about witchcraft
[46:41] and the root of witchcraft or
[46:44] manipulation is rebellion and I think
[46:49] maybe some of you remember that in 1st
[46:51] Samuel Chapter 15 the Bible talks about
[46:54] that Samuel the Prophet prophesied or
[46:59] spoke the Word of God to Saul that he
[47:04] should attack
[47:05] utterly destroy the Amalekites for
[47:08] opposing the children of Israel when
[47:10] they first arrived in the land of
[47:12] promise generations before and according
[47:15] to the instructions that were given not
[47:18] just men but women and children and
[47:20] everything had to be dealt with it was a
[47:23] time of possessing the inheritance that
[47:27] God had given to the people and and if
[47:30] any of of that which was living in the
[47:34] land at the time if it was allowed to
[47:36] continue to thrive there was the
[47:38] possibility that would it come back and
[47:41] and that this thing would never be dealt
[47:44] with and so God gave very specific
[47:46] instructions and King Saul as instructed
[47:51] he went out to conquer the Amalekites
[47:53] but he failed to follow through on all
[47:57] of God's directives he destroyed all the
[48:00] people and the animals but he reserved
[48:04] the choicest livestock for his men and
[48:08] himself and he also preserved the life
[48:11] of King Agag who was the king of the
[48:14] Amalekites I think you probably remember
[48:16] the story and when samuel confronted saw
[48:21] for failing to obey God's commandments
[48:23] completely he rebuked Saul by saying
[48:26] first samuel 15 verse 23 for rebellion
[48:30] is as the sin of witchcraft and
[48:35] stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry
[48:39] I find this interesting because
[48:43] rebellion is likened to witchcraft and
[48:47] stubbornness is likened to idolatry you
[48:52] see every every negative manifestation
[48:55] in our life has another root it has
[48:58] another spiritual root or spiritual
[49:00] cause so we learn here there there's a
[49:04] spirit behind rebellion and it's not the
[49:07] Holy Spirit rather it's the spirit of
[49:10] witchcraft or manipulation how can a
[49:14] stubborn person be guilty of idolatry he
[49:18] makes an eye
[49:19] of all of his own opinions his opinions
[49:22] become like gods like idols to him
[49:27] stubbornness says I'll do it my way and
[49:31] God says that is idolatry when we choose
[49:37] to do it our way instead of considering
[49:40] God's way the scripture says we are
[49:44] guilty of idolatry I don't know if
[49:48] you've ever known someone who so trusted
[49:51] in their opinions that they actually
[49:53] worship their own ideas but that's
[49:56] exactly what the scripture is talking
[49:58] about in these in this portion of
[50:01] Scripture rebellion and witchcraft are
[50:04] like identical twin sisters if you find
[50:07] one you'd better look for the other if
[50:10] witchcraft is present manipulation is
[50:13] present then rebellion is somewhere at
[50:16] the root of the manifestation of that
[50:20] manipulation or witchcraft they're
[50:23] seldom separated they operate together
[50:26] in the New Testament when the Bible
[50:29] speaks about witchcraft first it calls
[50:32] it a work of the flesh secondly it's
[50:37] referred to as an evil spiritual power
[50:41] first a work of the flesh and then an
[50:44] evil spiritual power so if we start
[50:48] talking about witchcraft as one of the
[50:51] schemes and devices of the enemy we have
[50:54] to understand that witchcraft is more
[50:58] than just someone belonging to a group a
[51:03] coven of witches and operating in in in
[51:07] dark magic or in curses or incantations
[51:10] we have to understand that there's a
[51:13] form of witchcraft that's a work of the
[51:15] flesh and that is when we rebel against
[51:20] the purposes of God in our life we're
[51:24] already operating in a measure of
[51:27] witchcraft we see in Galatians chapter 3
[51:30] at verse 1
[51:33] who has bewitched you that you should
[51:37] not obey the truth before whose eyes
[51:40] Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among
[51:44] you as crucified this is the Apostle
[51:48] Paul talking to the church at Galatia
[51:51] using a term that translates in English
[51:56] who has bewitched you we could
[51:58] paraphrase that by saying who has cast a
[52:01] spell on you that you are not obeying
[52:04] the truth see it was rebellion we know
[52:08] the truth we hear the truth but we
[52:10] refuse to do it
[52:11] we're going to walk in our own way it's
[52:14] like the Old Testament talks about it on
[52:18] more than one occasion when the people
[52:20] were doing their own way their own
[52:23] living their own life and the scripture
[52:25] calls it like this every man did that
[52:28] which was right in his own eyes that's
[52:31] so dangerous the Bible has given us an
[52:34] absolute truth of what is right and what
[52:37] is wrong and we're obligated in fact
[52:40] it's really a privilege as citizens of
[52:42] the kingdom of God to live by what God
[52:46] has called us to live by
[52:48] it's a privilege it's not a heavy burden
[52:51] on our shoulders the Bible says there's
[52:54] a scripture that says His commandments
[52:56] are not Grievous to me why because I
[52:59] left him when you love the Lord you want
[53:03] to bring your life into alignment with
[53:06] what God's Word says so that you can
[53:09] also enjoy the benefits and the
[53:12] blessings of walking in the word I want
[53:16] to encourage you to make sure as you're
[53:21] searching your life to see if there is
[53:25] any open areas there that that need to
[53:30] be dealt with because the enemy is
[53:32] accessing through those through those
[53:35] areas while you're searching make sure
[53:38] that there is no rebellion in
[53:41] heart you are fully surrendered you are
[53:45] fully committed to follow the Lord Jesus
[53:49] Christ all the way to surrender to
[53:54] submit to the Word of God and what God
[53:57] is calling you to if indeed you are then
[54:03] it becomes much easier to find the
[54:06] freedom that you're looking for if while
[54:09] searching your life you find some areas
[54:12] that you're still holding on to your
[54:15] will to your way I want it to be this
[54:19] way this is how I want it to turn out
[54:21] this is what I'm after I'm not going to
[54:24] settle for anything less than this but
[54:26] if this is not God's Way then you're
[54:30] actually operating in a spirit of
[54:33] rebellion which will manifest in your
[54:36] life like witchcraft it can cause you a
[54:40] tremendous amount of trouble that you
[54:43] just absolutely do not want to have
[54:45] father I ask right now I know that we've
[54:49] covered some unusual subjects here and
[54:52] we've maybe had a couple of subjects in
[54:55] one and in one lesson but I just pray
[54:59] for sincere hearts that are watching
[55:02] this program right now I just pray that
[55:05] you will by your grace and mercy put
[55:09] your finger on every area of their lives
[55:14] as they submit it and hold it before you
[55:17] where there might be an element of
[55:20] rebellion where there might be an
[55:22] element of demanding their own right
[55:27] instead of your way and your purpose and
[55:30] your plan and I pray that you'll point
[55:33] that out and that you will provide the
[55:36] grace as they call on your name so that
[55:40] every open door that the enemy is taking
[55:44] advantage of to launch attack against
[55:48] them and those they love I pray that it
[55:51] can be slammed shut in the name of the
[55:54] Lord Jesus Christ and access denied we
[55:59] just say right now by faith to the enemy
[56:02] access denied
[56:05] I'm a child of God washed in the blood
[56:09] of Jesus I pray right now Lord for any
[56:13] person watching this program who has a
[56:16] route of rejection in their life that's
[56:19] holding them back or that's driving them
[56:23] to addiction the woundedness of
[56:26] rejection the pain of being rejected and
[56:30] yet it grows like a root in their life
[56:33] and they're having a hard time dealing
[56:36] with the addiction or dealing with the
[56:39] fruit because there's a root problem I
[56:42] pray Lord that you will deal with people
[56:46] now that you will release power and
[56:49] strength right now for every person in
[56:52] that condition so that they might be
[56:54] able to forgive so that they might be
[56:56] able to release to set free all of those
[57:01] who have wounded them or rejected them
[57:03] that the root could be healed that that
[57:08] that the root could be dealt with so
[57:11] that good fruit godly fruit the fruit of
[57:16] the Spirit could be produced in their
[57:18] life I pray this in the name of the Lord
[57:22] Jesus Christ amen any man I want to
[57:26] invite you again to contact us with your
[57:30] prayer requests I truly believe that the
[57:34] Lord wants to move on your behalf will
[57:37] join our faith together we'll believe
[57:41] God for a brighter future I know that if
[57:45] we can see God move in the root of the
[57:48] problem we can see more beautiful fruit
[57:51] we can see the fruit of the Spirit we
[57:55] can claim this verse of scripture for
[57:57] our life more love more joy peace
[58:00] long-suffering gentleness goodness faith
[58:02] meekness and temperance we claim that
[58:06] out of our life in the name of the Lord
