[58:21] when you fall into diverse Temptations
[58:25] knowing this that the trying of your
[58:29] faith worketh
[58:32] patience but let patience have her
[58:35] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[58:40] entire wanting
[58:42] nothing if you'll turn back a page or
[58:46] two Hebrews chapter
[58:49] 12 verse one 2 and three wherefore
[58:54] seeing we also are compassed about with
[58:57] so great a cloud of
[58:59] witnesses let us lay aside every
[59:02] weight and the sin which does so easily
[59:06] beset us and let us run with patience
[59:10] the race that is set before
[59:12] us looking unto Jesus the author and
[59:16] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[59:20] that was set before him endured the
[59:23] cross despising the shame and is sat
[59:27] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[59:30] God for consider him that endured such
[59:34] contradiction of Sinners against
[59:38] himself lest you be wearied and faint in
[59:43] your
[59:44] minds let's pray before you're
[59:48] seated father how grateful we are to be
[59:51] gathered once again in your
[59:53] house with Saints of like Precious Faith
[59:56] both here in the building and those that

[1:00:08] necessary Grace as we travel this
[1:00:11] journey we thank you Lord that you are
[1:00:14] among us today that you have uh done
[1:00:19] what you said you would do and now we're
[1:00:21] asking that you would let your an
[1:00:24] anointing Your Grace rest upon your
[1:00:27] servant as I try to deliver the word of
[1:00:29] the Lord that you've laid on my heart I
[1:00:32] pray that you will hide me behind the
[1:00:35] cross of Calvary the blood of Jesus
[1:00:38] Christ I'm asking you Lord that as I
[1:00:41] open my mouth that you would fill it and
[1:00:43] speak Words of Life to us today we will
[1:00:47] glorify you and Praise You Lord our
[1:00:50] pastor on a
[1:00:52] holiday along with his family family
[1:00:55] Lord workers of the Kingdom we pray your
[1:00:57] blessing on them asking that you would
[1:01:00] renew them and refresh them God I pray
[1:01:04] that you will pour into them what is
[1:01:07] needed for the future journey we'll give
[1:01:10] you praise and honor now for it's in the
[1:01:13] name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we
[1:01:16] pray amen amen may the Lord bless you as
[1:01:20] you have your seat
[1:01:23] today
[1:01:26] I would like to read these same passages
[1:01:28] if you will bear with me I would like to
[1:01:32] read both passages once again in the
[1:01:35] Amplified they give a few more words of
[1:01:40] amplification James chap 1 verse one
[1:01:43] James a servant of God and of the Lord
[1:01:46] Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes scattered
[1:01:49] abroad among the Gentiles in the
[1:01:52] dispersion greetings re
[1:01:55] joice consider it wholly joyful my
[1:01:59] brethren whenever you are enveloped in
[1:02:03] or encounter Trials of any sort or fall
[1:02:08] into various
[1:02:11] Temptations be assured and understand
[1:02:15] that the trial and proving of your faith
[1:02:19] bring out endurance and
[1:02:23] steadfastness and
[1:02:25] patience but let endurance and
[1:02:29] steadfastness and patience have full
[1:02:33] play and do a thorough work so that you
[1:02:37] may be people perfectly and fully
[1:02:42] developed with no
[1:02:44] defects lacking in
[1:02:47] nothing now in the King James and also
[1:02:52] in uh the amplif ified the word patience
[1:02:56] I want you to hold on to that just a
[1:02:59] moment as we look to Hebrews chapter 12
[1:03:03] again and read these three verses in the
[1:03:06] Amplified therefore then since we are
[1:03:09] surrounded by so great a cloud of
[1:03:12] witnesses who have borne testimony to
[1:03:15] the
[1:03:16] truth let us strip off and throw aside
[1:03:21] every
[1:03:22] incumbrance unne necessary
[1:03:25] weight and that
[1:03:28] sin which so readily deafly and cleverly
[1:03:33] clings to and entangles us and let us
[1:03:37] run with patient endurance and steady
[1:03:42] and active
[1:03:44] persistence the appointed course of the
[1:03:47] race that is set before us now I always
[1:03:51] like to remind us when we see the word
[1:03:54] word sin to remember how that brother
[1:03:57] Bram defined the word sin not only to
[1:04:01] miss the mark but he said the word sin
[1:04:04] is also unbelief all of those uh things
[1:04:08] that we classify under sin are only a
[1:04:12] part of our Lives because of
[1:04:16] unbelief verse two looking away from all
[1:04:20] that will distract to Jesus
[1:04:28] changing the focus of where we're
[1:04:30] looking looking away from all that will
[1:04:33] distract to Jesus who is the leader and
[1:04:37] the source of our faith giving the first
[1:04:41] incentive for our
[1:04:45] belief you didn't do it on your own
[1:04:48] right right you may think that you were
[1:04:51] seeking the
[1:04:53] Lord but I can't seek for him unless
[1:04:56] he's seeking for
[1:04:58] me so he's the one that gave the first
[1:05:01] incentive for our belief and it is also
[1:05:04] he is also the finisher bringing it to
[1:05:08] maturity and
[1:05:11] Perfection he for the joy of obtaining
[1:05:14] the prize that was set before him
[1:05:17] endured the cross despising and ignoring
[1:05:21] the shame and is now seated at the right
[1:05:23] hand of the Throne of
[1:05:26] God just think of him who endured from
[1:05:31] Sinners such Grievous
[1:05:34] opposition and bitter hostility against
[1:05:38] himself reckon up and consider it all in
[1:05:43] comparison with your
[1:05:45] trials so that you may not grow weary or
[1:05:50] exhausted losing heart and relx
[1:05:54] relaxing and fainting in your
[1:06:05] mind when you think
[1:06:08] about all that you have been through in
[1:06:12] all of your
[1:06:15] trials we're told that compared to what
[1:06:19] he went
[1:06:22] through that it's not even a good
[1:06:28] comparison all the humiliation that he
[1:06:31] went
[1:06:34] through when I think about Believers
[1:06:37] from past
[1:06:39] ages who appear in Fox's book of Martyrs
[1:06:44] and other writings and what they went
[1:06:49] through you may think that some of that
[1:06:52] is a comparison that that could be
[1:06:54] compared to what he went
[1:06:57] through but
[1:07:00] yet the Apostle Paul tells us that he
[1:07:05] went through all of this all that they
[1:07:07] went
[1:07:08] through was not enough to buy eternal
[1:07:11] life for you and for
[1:07:14] me no matter how much humiliation they
[1:07:17] went through no matter what they faced
[1:07:20] as their heads were chopped off as they
[1:07:23] were their bellies were cut open and
[1:07:25] salt was poured in there and they drew
[1:07:28] their last breath their lives were never
[1:07:31] their blood was never enough to buy my
[1:07:35] Redemption my eternal life it wasn't
[1:07:39] what they went through was awful and I'm
[1:07:42] thankful that God gave them the Grace
[1:07:45] under their part of that those four
[1:07:48] living creatures they were given the
[1:07:51] grace to be humiliated in that way and
[1:07:55] we're reading stories even today of what
[1:07:58] some of these uh people in Israel went
[1:08:01] through during that Massacre some of the
[1:08:04] stories that we're reading are the same
[1:08:07] kind of
[1:08:09] atrocities against the people of of
[1:08:12] Israel and but none of it could buy my
[1:08:17] Redemption there was only one that could
[1:08:20] buy my Redemption and that's the Lord
[1:08:22] Jesus Christ
[1:08:24] but there are two words here one is
[1:08:27] found in the book of James and the King
[1:08:30] James uses the word patience and that is
[1:08:34] the Greek word
[1:08:37] 5281 which means
[1:08:40] steadfastness
[1:08:41] constancy and
[1:08:44] endurance and then we read uh in in
[1:08:49] Hebrews
[1:08:51] 12:2 the word endured
[1:08:54] comes from the Greek word
[1:08:58] 5278 which has the same uh same kind of
[1:09:03] definition but what I wanted to say was
[1:09:06] the word patience in the Book of James
[1:09:10] there that we read in verses 1 2 and
[1:09:12] three the word patience is 5281 and
[1:09:17] 5281 comes from the word 5278 endurance
[1:09:23] in which Jesus the for the joy that was
[1:09:26] set before him
[1:09:30] endured he
[1:09:32] endured now all of this
[1:09:36] endurance uh it it takes a level of
[1:09:40] patience that when we started this
[1:09:43] journey we did not seem to
[1:09:46] have there are some people that have uh
[1:09:51] what seems to be more natur naturally
[1:09:54] patience for their fellow man and there
[1:09:58] are others who more naturally seem to
[1:10:02] have no patience for
[1:10:07] anything don't bother categorizing
[1:10:10] yourself and please don't categorize
[1:10:15] me let's lay all of that
[1:10:18] aside because we are all pushing
[1:10:23] pressing ing enduring with patience the
[1:10:27] race that is set before us and we've all
[1:10:33] failed all of us have
[1:10:39] failed we've had our moments where that
[1:10:42] we could be as
[1:10:45] patient as the day is
[1:10:48] long and there are other days where our
[1:10:53] patience
[1:10:54] somehow had hid in the closet and we
[1:10:57] didn't know where what we had
[1:11:01] yesterday it's nowhere near evident
[1:11:04] today it almost seems to come and go and
[1:11:09] even those that seem to be the most
[1:11:11] patient Among Us have days where they
[1:11:14] lose their
[1:11:17] cool and have no patience for anything
[1:11:22] or anyone
[1:11:25] one because we all have good days and we
[1:11:28] all have bad
[1:11:30] days yet the Holy Spirit by his word has
[1:11:36] called us to walk this race with
[1:11:40] patience to run the race with patience
[1:11:44] that is set before us to endure all the
[1:11:48] way to the
[1:11:52] end we look look in the Old
[1:11:55] Testament and we
[1:11:57] see that there were a group of people
[1:12:01] that were in
[1:12:04] bondage and
[1:12:08] Joseph prophesied to the
[1:12:11] people and he said you're going to be
[1:12:14] here in bondage 400 years we've already
[1:12:17] heard that but I want you to know that
[1:12:20] there's going to come a time when God is
[1:12:22] going to give you your release when he
[1:12:27] does he did not say if he does when he
[1:12:32] does when you get up and get out of here
[1:12:35] I want you to make sure that you do not
[1:12:38] leave my bones behind in
[1:12:42] Egypt years and years go by and the time
[1:12:45] comes for the Deliverance of the
[1:12:48] children of
[1:12:49] Israel now through all of the
[1:12:52] Deliverance the people have been working
[1:12:55] in
[1:12:56] slavery they're under Pharaoh's bondage
[1:13:00] and God start showing them signs and
[1:13:06] wonders how much time span be it between
[1:13:09] each of those uh signs and wonders I
[1:13:12] don't know the scripture doesn't tell us
[1:13:15] but the people watched as as the plagues
[1:13:18] came to Egypt and Goan was spared and
[1:13:23] the these plagues one by one were given
[1:13:26] upon the Egyptians until finally Pharaoh
[1:13:32] said take your people and
[1:13:37] go now you
[1:13:40] remember
[1:13:42] Moses came before Pharaoh time and again
[1:13:46] and there were times where that Pharaoh
[1:13:49] said you can go but leave your wives and
[1:13:52] your children in the TOS
[1:13:54] here finally Moses said when we leave
[1:13:58] we're taking
[1:14:00] everything there will not be one hoof
[1:14:03] that will be left
[1:14:05] behind and when the time came you know
[1:14:09] you got to
[1:14:11] remember it wasn't Moses that hardened
[1:14:14] Pharaoh's
[1:14:19] heart it wasn't even
[1:14:22] pharaoh by his own will that hardened
[1:14:25] his heart the Bible says the Lord
[1:14:28] hardened Pharaoh's
[1:14:30] heart so when you're facing your your
[1:14:34] trials you be careful who you're
[1:14:36] slinging
[1:14:41] at because God has an ordained path for
[1:14:44] you because he knows what it's going to
[1:14:46] take to get you to the place where that
[1:14:49] you are perfect lacking nothing
[1:14:54] and what it takes for you is not the
[1:14:57] same as what it takes for me and what it
[1:14:59] takes for me is not the same as what it
[1:15:01] takes for you and now the people are
[1:15:04] watching all of these signs and wonders
[1:15:07] these beautiful things that God is doing
[1:15:10] to bring about the release of his people
[1:15:17] until
[1:15:19] Pharaoh had
[1:15:21] enough because it touched his
[1:15:28] house and Pharaoh said get out take what
[1:15:32] you
[1:15:33] need if you need anything you get it and
[1:15:40] go the interesting thing is that when
[1:15:44] Moses walked
[1:15:46] out and begin the journey with the
[1:15:48] children of
[1:15:50] Israel God let Moses know
[1:15:53] know that he was going to harden
[1:15:56] Pharaoh's heart
[1:16:01] again now I just
[1:16:04] wonder if I was in the middle of a
[1:16:09] trial and had this glorious
[1:16:13] Victory and God comes to me and
[1:16:16] says It's Not
[1:16:22] Over it's not
[1:16:24] over I've given you a great Victory but
[1:16:28] it's not
[1:16:30] over what would be our
[1:16:38] reaction Moses didn't throw up his hands
[1:16:40] and say okay then I quit may as well
[1:16:43] leave them here if it ain't over I'm
[1:16:46] just you know I
[1:16:48] I we'll try it again another
[1:16:52] day
[1:16:53] No Moses was watching the hand of the
[1:16:56] Lord in all of this as were the people
[1:16:59] of Israel so they're all gathered
[1:17:01] together and they're going out of Israel
[1:17:03] and God is think about the joy that is
[1:17:07] in these people's heart because they
[1:17:09] didn't hear the word of the Lord that
[1:17:10] Moses got
[1:17:13] right they didn't hear God tell Moses
[1:17:16] this ain't over I'm going to harden
[1:17:19] Pharaoh's heart again none of them heard
[1:17:22] that
[1:17:23] they were just joyous because they're
[1:17:25] Laden down with all this Egyptian gold
[1:17:28] they have utterly Left Behind
[1:17:31] Devastation in the land of Israel and
[1:17:33] we're going forward to the land of
[1:17:36] promise that has been promised to us and
[1:17:39] none of them are watching where they're
[1:17:43] going they're not watching the path the
[1:17:46] they they don't have a GPS that they can
[1:17:49] look at and say hey
[1:17:51] Moses you uh you aren't doing a very
[1:17:54] good job of leading us to the promised
[1:17:57] land you look like you're taking us down
[1:18:00] to Waters that are uncrossable what is
[1:18:03] the matter with you Moses none of them
[1:18:07] had that
[1:18:08] ability they were in the joy of the
[1:18:12] moment of being freed
[1:18:17] slaves and as they're marching along
[1:18:21] going along they're riding on on a high
[1:18:24] and the people are living their best
[1:18:28] non-slave
[1:18:37] life just think about what theyve if if
[1:18:40] a man 40 years
[1:18:43] old had been had had been born in
[1:18:48] Goan and from his childhood he was a
[1:18:51] slave
[1:18:53] from the moment he was able to carry a
[1:18:55] bucket of water he was told he had to
[1:18:58] work and now all all through those years
[1:19:02] that he has been a slave and his hands
[1:19:04] are gnarled and calloused and he's been
[1:19:07] a bearer of burdens all these years and
[1:19:10] now it's the first day or the second day
[1:19:14] of release from captivity and he is
[1:19:17] living his best non-slave
[1:19:21] life nothing to do but pull the wagon
[1:19:26] carry the gold make sure the cows are
[1:19:29] being driven in the right spot to stay
[1:19:32] together as a group not paying attention
[1:19:35] that their leader is leading them right
[1:19:37] down into a place that God had designed
[1:19:42] for
[1:19:45] them
[1:19:47] so as they get down to this place where
[1:19:50] you have the Red Sea you have
[1:19:54] mountains all of the sudden they start
[1:19:57] recognizing that
[1:20:04] Pharaoh Pharaoh is coming up behind
[1:20:10] them and the accusations
[1:20:19] start
[1:20:21] Moses
[1:20:23] did you bring us out here because there
[1:20:25] were no graves in
[1:20:27] Egypt Moses did you bring us out here is
[1:20:30] this the way you're going to treat us
[1:20:31] now that we're out of Egypt you didn't
[1:20:34] think we were under enough slave labor
[1:20:37] there
[1:20:38] Moses didn't we tell you to leave us in
[1:20:42] Egypt just to leave us
[1:20:49] alone there was probably plenty of those
[1:20:52] voices back back in Egypt that said
[1:20:54] leave us alone because you remember when
[1:20:57] Moses came and said I'm here to lead God
[1:21:00] people out and Pharaoh said you got too
[1:21:02] much time on your hand i'm taking away
[1:21:04] your provision of straw you're going to
[1:21:06] have to go collect your own straw to
[1:21:08] still make my number of bricks that I
[1:21:10] need for the building of my city you got
[1:21:13] too much time on your hand and then the
[1:21:15] people got mad at Moses because now they
[1:21:17] got more work to do than they ever had
[1:21:19] before and they're not provided the
[1:21:21] things that they need and so they got
[1:21:22] mad at Moses then and now they're
[1:21:24] throwing it back up at Moses didn't we
[1:21:27] tell you to leave us in Egypt and just
[1:21:29] leave us
[1:21:34] alone that's what we
[1:21:38] do that's what we
[1:21:40] do when we're not running the race with
[1:21:44] patience and endurance the race that is
[1:21:47] set before
[1:21:49] us God wanted to show his mighty hand
[1:21:52] once
[1:21:53] again and he wanted
[1:21:55] to show
[1:21:57] them as he does us he overlooked their
[1:22:02] sin their unbelief he overlooked it
[1:22:06] because he wanted to show his hand to
[1:22:09] them
[1:22:10] again and he opened up the Red Sea and
[1:22:14] when he opened up the Red Sea he made
[1:22:16] the path for them to go across another
[1:22:19] great sign and wonder that God performed
[1:22:22] for them then when they got to the other
[1:22:26] side he let them see another great
[1:22:31] miracle when Egyptians were trying to
[1:22:34] chase after them and the Sea closed back
[1:22:37] down over
[1:22:40] them there was great shouting and
[1:22:43] dancing time of Jubilation on the other
[1:22:46] side of the Red Sea and the people saw
[1:22:50] that their slave masters were once in
[1:22:52] for all on the other side or they were
[1:22:56] drowned rather in the sea and they were
[1:22:58] shouting the Praises of God in
[1:23:01] Jubilation because God had drowned them
[1:23:04] in the sea the their enemies in the sea
[1:23:07] and now Moses begins to lead the
[1:23:12] people the Bible tells us that they went
[1:23:14] into the
[1:23:16] Wilderness and they encountered bitter
[1:23:21] water
[1:23:23] anybody ever encountered Bitter
[1:23:27] Water
[1:23:30] Mara and what is the first thing that
[1:23:34] the people
[1:23:36] do they Grumble against the leader they
[1:23:40] Grumble against
[1:23:42] Moses Moses sought the Lord on their
[1:23:45] behalf and God told him what to do a
[1:23:47] certain thing to throw in the water and
[1:23:49] the waters became sweet so there rest in
[1:23:52] beside the Sweet Waters of Myra now and
[1:23:56] and they're
[1:23:59] they're still
[1:24:03] people and God after they Camp a while
[1:24:05] there God begins to lead them again Into
[1:24:09] the Wilderness of
[1:24:11] sin and the whole congregation once
[1:24:15] again murmurs and grumbles against Moses
[1:24:19] and against Aaron and if if you had only
[1:24:24] left us to die in
[1:24:26] Egypt at least in Egypt we had
[1:24:31] bread at least in Egypt we had water we
[1:24:36] had meat to eat we were full we were
[1:24:39] able to eat until that we were
[1:24:45] full God gave them
[1:24:47] Mana God fed
[1:24:50] them he fed them
[1:24:53] what they needed to
[1:24:55] survive now I I just like to read from
[1:24:59] Numbers Chapter 11 veres 1-6 when the
[1:25:04] people
[1:25:05] complained it displeased the Lord and
[1:25:08] the Lord heard it and his anger was
[1:25:12] kindled and the fire of the Lord burnt
[1:25:15] among them and consumed them that were
[1:25:17] in the uttermost parts of the
[1:25:21] camp and the people Cried unto Moses and
[1:25:24] when Moses prayed unto the Lord the fire
[1:25:27] was quenched and he called the name of
[1:25:30] the place tabara because the fire of the
[1:25:32] Lord burned among
[1:25:34] them and the mixed multitude was among
[1:25:38] them fell austing and the children of
[1:25:40] Israel also wept again and said who
[1:25:42] shall give us flesh to eat we remember
[1:25:45] the fish which we did eat in Egypt
[1:25:48] freely the Cucumbers the melons the
[1:25:51] leaks the onions and the garlic but now
[1:25:55] our soul is dried away there's nothing
[1:25:58] at
[1:25:59] all beside this Mana before our
[1:26:08] eyes now what I want us to see here
[1:26:13] is that God brought them out by a mighty
[1:26:21] hand
[1:26:23] and when they were in captivity in
[1:26:27] Israel they were
[1:26:32] complainers and when they came out of
[1:26:35] Egypt by a mighty strong hand when
[1:26:39] things didn't go quite their
[1:26:41] way they were still
[1:26:47] complainers and when they complained to
[1:26:51] Moses that they didn't have anything to
[1:26:54] eat you should have left us in
[1:27:04] Egypt Moses called on the Lord and man
[1:27:08] the lord gave them Mana And Then There
[1:27:11] came the time when the Mana became a a
[1:27:15] just yucky to them they'd had enough of
[1:27:18] it and they cried to Moses again and it
[1:27:22] upset the Lord God and his anger was
[1:27:25] kindled and a fire went through and then
[1:27:28] there they they start talking about all
[1:27:31] of this stuff that they had in
[1:27:38] Egypt now I want
[1:27:41] to equate that to
[1:27:46] us when we run low on
[1:27:51] patience
[1:27:52] because God started us on a
[1:27:56] journey that was not going to be an easy
[1:28:02] Journey he never promised that to
[1:28:05] us he told us to come and follow him and
[1:28:11] that we could lay down our heavy burdens
[1:28:15] and we could take on his yoke and he
[1:28:17] said my burden is easy my yoke is light
[1:28:22] right the problem is so many times we
[1:28:27] took on his yoke and his burden but we
[1:28:31] go back and pick up our
[1:28:34] burden and we end up carrying more than
[1:28:37] one burden and a lot of Burden that we
[1:28:40] are not supposed to be carrying yet we
[1:28:43] carry it just the
[1:28:45] same and so we run out of patience
[1:28:49] because fiery Trials come our way
[1:28:52] because that we're in the wilderness and
[1:28:55] it seems like that Mana is not coming to
[1:28:58] us we're not getting the same nutrition
[1:29:02] from the word that we got at one
[1:29:07] time and we resort to throwing really in
[1:29:12] God's
[1:29:14] face felt better when I was over in
[1:29:20] Egypt you see this this is why people
[1:29:24] glamorized the sin that they were in
[1:29:28] before they left
[1:29:29] Egypt because they become weary in welld
[1:29:33] doing and they throw down what burden
[1:29:37] God gave to them and they go back to
[1:29:40] picking up the burden of
[1:29:43] Egypt because they lose patience with
[1:29:47] God and the race that he has set before
[1:29:50] us go back to to old paradigms that's
[1:29:53] what we tend to gravitate toward old
[1:29:56] paradigms old sinful habits old sinful
[1:30:00] nature we end up going back to it
[1:30:03] because we get weary in the
[1:30:09] race God lays this race before
[1:30:15] us he didn't force
[1:30:18] us but he called us amen
[1:30:23] and when he called us he called us with
[1:30:26] such a calling that he would provide
[1:30:29] every single thing for the
[1:30:32] journey that's
[1:30:34] right I believe that God would have
[1:30:40] provided for the children of Israel the
[1:30:44] Mana the food the water that they
[1:30:50] needed if they would have approached him
[1:30:52] with a right
[1:30:54] attitude sir he provided it just the
[1:31:00] same but he would have provided it all
[1:31:03] along the
[1:31:05] journey and so we're given this story of
[1:31:08] the children of Israel for example to us
[1:31:11] that as we watch them in their
[1:31:13] journeying through their Wilderness
[1:31:17] every time that something came up that
[1:31:19] they could not deal with they murmured
[1:31:22] and they complained they grumbled and
[1:31:25] they mumbled at Moses most of the time
[1:31:28] because Moses was the leader Aaron with
[1:31:31] him they murmured against both of these
[1:31:33] men and constantly they're murmuring
[1:31:37] against these
[1:31:39] men and God in his
[1:31:45] Mercy gave them what they
[1:31:47] needed now as the journey went on God
[1:31:51] said did for Moses to send spies into
[1:31:54] the land and we know how that ended up
[1:31:57] and and and as they came back and gave
[1:32:01] this evil
[1:32:03] report and the majority of them gave the
[1:32:07] evil report and only two gave an a
[1:32:10] report that it's a good land it's what
[1:32:13] God promised to us it's a land flowing
[1:32:16] with milk and honey but the voices of
[1:32:19] the denters grew loud and louder until
[1:32:23] the congregation grabbed hold of the
[1:32:25] murmuring and the complaining of those
[1:32:28] 10 that had an evil report and they
[1:32:31] latched on to
[1:32:34] it now you see why it's important who
[1:32:37] you fellowship
[1:32:41] with what you latch on to what you
[1:32:44] decide you want to listen to who you
[1:32:47] want to listen to even though it looks
[1:32:49] like that they have uh they have a a a
[1:32:53] Charisma about them that it looks like
[1:32:56] they're really the they're really the
[1:32:58] epitome of a great leader but yet they
[1:33:01] do not have the word for you for this
[1:33:05] moment but yet you gravitate or I
[1:33:08] gravitate toward it because it makes me
[1:33:11] feel better for the moment come
[1:33:15] on gravitate toward that start feeling
[1:33:19] the pull toward it and then people start
[1:33:23] sliding
[1:33:26] backwards and as we start sliding
[1:33:28] backwards we start reaching out for
[1:33:41] Egypt why do you
[1:33:45] think that you saw more
[1:33:49] people around what we call
[1:33:52] message why do you think that they
[1:33:57] celebrated
[1:34:00] Halloween you saw more pictures this
[1:34:02] year than ever why is
[1:34:05] that when people don't run the race with
[1:34:08] patience they start gravitating back
[1:34:11] toward
[1:34:16] Babylon when we don't run the race with
[1:34:19] patience and we feel like we're in a
[1:34:22] stuck place we feel like we're in a
[1:34:24] place where that we're not exactly
[1:34:26] moving forward and for whatever reason
[1:34:30] we can't hear from God at that
[1:34:31] particular moment why do we always reach
[1:34:34] back to Egypt come on why do we reach
[1:34:38] back to the things that we left behind
[1:34:41] why do we reach back to fil pornography
[1:34:44] why do we reach back to to Halloween and
[1:34:47] reach back to Christmas and reach back
[1:34:50] and back and back until the that we're
[1:34:52] bringing Egypt forward with
[1:34:56] us somewhere Egypt's still hanging
[1:35:01] on it was for the children of Israel sir
[1:35:05] when Moses was up in the
[1:35:08] mountain remember they brought the
[1:35:10] spirit of Egypt with them it was a mixed
[1:35:13] multitude and they grabbed a hold of all
[1:35:16] of the gold that they could carry out of
[1:35:19] Egypt now I know that it was for a
[1:35:21] purpose because God was going to Overlay
[1:35:24] everything in his in his temple with
[1:35:29] gold but because of the impatience of
[1:35:32] the
[1:35:33] people while Moses was in the mountain
[1:35:36] getting the word of the Lord the people
[1:35:39] were in the camp
[1:35:40] impatient on because Moses was in the
[1:35:44] mountain so long and they were stuck in
[1:35:47] one place it didn't seem like they were
[1:35:49] going anywhere and so they reverted back
[1:35:52] to Egypt oh yeah
[1:35:56] Aaron we need something to
[1:36:03] worship God doesn't seem to be around
[1:36:06] you know he Moses we don't know what
[1:36:09] happened to him he's been gone so long
[1:36:12] you know the the prophet died so many
[1:36:14] years ago and and and it just doesn't
[1:36:17] seem like things are happening the way
[1:36:18] they ought to be happening Moses is gone
[1:36:23] Aaron we we need something to
[1:36:29] worship we're seeing it we are seeing it
[1:36:33] in our
[1:36:34] day because people have become
[1:36:38] impatient with what God promised was
[1:36:41] going to be in the last
[1:36:44] day his soon and my
[1:36:48] soon are two different things
[1:36:53] do you know why that
[1:36:56] is his soon and my soon are two
[1:36:59] different things because I operate on
[1:37:02] time and God operates in
[1:37:06] eternity my life my span of life is but
[1:37:09] a blip to
[1:37:12] him but God is faithful and he is going
[1:37:16] to keep every one of his promises he is
[1:37:20] not going to let let you uh he's not
[1:37:22] going to let his bride be forsaken along
[1:37:25] the way he's going to keep every one of
[1:37:28] his promises and he's looking for people
[1:37:31] who will run the race with patience this
[1:37:35] race that is set before them and when it
[1:37:38] looks like that nothing is happening
[1:37:40] then it is important for us to look to
[1:37:44] the word and find our answers to look to
[1:37:47] the not revert back to
[1:37:50] Egypt
[1:37:52] Egypt has nothing for
[1:37:55] you see these people they they they were
[1:37:59] telling Moses we
[1:38:02] remember we remember the leaks and the
[1:38:05] garlics we remember the flavor of the
[1:38:09] food that we ate while we were in Egypt
[1:38:13] and and and our stomachs were were full
[1:38:16] of bread
[1:38:19] and but the didn't mention the slavery
[1:38:22] they were still in while their stomachs
[1:38:25] were getting
[1:38:28] full they only remembered because their
[1:38:31] stomachs were grumbling and their they
[1:38:34] they were uh growling that they wanted
[1:38:37] some food and so the only thing they
[1:38:39] could do was reach back to what they
[1:38:41] knew instead of looking to the one who
[1:38:44] had made the promise to them that they
[1:38:46] were going into a land filled with milk
[1:38:48] and honey and that he was going to take
[1:38:50] them through all the way through and
[1:38:53] that even though it looks scarce at the
[1:38:56] moment he was going to see them all the
[1:38:58] way
[1:39:06] through one of the
[1:39:08] things that leads
[1:39:10] us to
[1:39:14] be
[1:39:16] grumblers is
[1:39:18] unthankfulness
[1:39:20] right
[1:39:24] when we are not thankful for what we
[1:39:29] have you remember during peso
[1:39:34] Passover
[1:39:38] Dau it would have been
[1:39:41] enough this whole list of things if God
[1:39:44] would have did done this but not done
[1:39:46] this it would have been
[1:39:48] enough if he would have brought us out
[1:39:50] of Egypt but not given us the land of
[1:39:52] promise it would have been enough and
[1:39:55] all of these things that they go through
[1:39:57] and it's it's a thankful heart that God
[1:40:00] is looking for so that the promises can
[1:40:04] come to us and we have to be thankful
[1:40:06] for what we have at the moment and it
[1:40:09] may not look pretty at the moment but
[1:40:11] there's always something to be thankful
[1:40:14] for there's always something that we can
[1:40:17] thank the lord we can thank him that he
[1:40:21] brought us out of Egyptian
[1:40:23] slavery right we may not be where we
[1:40:27] want to be but thank God we aren't where
[1:40:30] we used to
[1:40:31] be I may not have attained everything
[1:40:34] that I desire to attain but I thank God
[1:40:37] that I've made some I've made some
[1:40:40] tracks I'm not where I used to be that's
[1:40:44] right I'm thankful for every word of
[1:40:46] Deliverance that he has given to me and
[1:40:49] I've taken a hold of it and I've chewed
[1:40:51] on
[1:40:53] it did I ever want to quit oh
[1:40:58] yes oh
[1:41:01] yes I've wanted to quit plenty of times
[1:41:05] not serving the
[1:41:08] lord I wanted to say bye-bye to some of
[1:41:14] us not because you'd done anything wrong
[1:41:17] to me but I was tired of the
[1:41:19] fight and I thought if I could get away
[1:41:22] from here that I'd be over the
[1:41:24] fight but when I belong to God and I
[1:41:27] belong in a certain
[1:41:30] place and I'm a part of the band of the
[1:41:33] army that is in a certain location to
[1:41:36] fight through certain things I may leave
[1:41:39] the
[1:41:40] location but my fight's not
[1:41:47] over the fight will never be over until
[1:41:50] I'm make that final
[1:41:53] Crossing and I'm just as well to be in
[1:41:56] my position and you in your position so
[1:42:00] that we can fight this fight together to
[1:42:03] see it all the way through maybe I'll be
[1:42:06] at a high and you'll be at a low and
[1:42:08] somehow i' be able to give an
[1:42:11] encouraging word to you to pull you
[1:42:13] along and perhaps the the journey will
[1:42:16] change and you'll be higher than I and
[1:42:19] I've at a low place you maybe outpace me
[1:42:22] and you can throw an encouraging word to
[1:42:25] me that's
[1:42:26] right we're going to fight this thing
[1:42:29] together we're going to run this race
[1:42:30] with patience that the this that is set
[1:42:33] before
[1:42:35] us now
[1:42:37] this there are so many things in this
[1:42:41] journey we we see in the message of the
[1:42:44] hour that brother brandham when he was
[1:42:47] explaining to the people about Divine
[1:42:49] Healing that he explained to them that
[1:42:54] the they may not see the evidence of
[1:42:58] their healing
[1:43:00] immediately and he explained to
[1:43:03] them even though it had not manifested
[1:43:07] to confess that it had it's good as done
[1:43:12] it's as good as
[1:43:14] done and he even in several places said
[1:43:19] keep saying it until you believe it if
[1:43:21] you don't believe it right now but you
[1:43:23] know it's in the word say it until you
[1:43:25] believe it and he used that all through
[1:43:30] that Divine Healing Ministry that God
[1:43:32] gave to him but it was for a greater
[1:43:36] expectation of a future generation that
[1:43:39] it was not going to be just for this
[1:43:41] outward
[1:43:42] body but it was going to be for the
[1:43:44] inner man that when we could look in the
[1:43:48] word and we could see that there there
[1:43:50] was a promise for the inner man that
[1:43:53] even if we could not wrap our mind
[1:43:56] around it we could take that word and
[1:43:59] declare it over ourselves with our mouth
[1:44:02] and that eventually our heart and our
[1:44:05] mind would believe it and we would see
[1:44:07] it come to
[1:44:09] pass we don't always operate that way
[1:44:15] we're getting better at it we're getting
[1:44:18] better at
[1:44:19] it we come together And We Worship the
[1:44:22] Lord and we lift up a praise to him as
[1:44:24] we did the today and and we we do that
[1:44:29] knowing that it was what he desires out
[1:44:32] of us that we would praise him with a
[1:44:35] loud voice and that we would clap our
[1:44:37] hands uh in a sound of Victory and there
[1:44:41] are many times where we clap our hands
[1:44:43] where that we don't feel victory at that
[1:44:45] very
[1:44:48] second yet the word declares it and we
[1:44:51] obey because it's what the word said and
[1:44:55] after a while if if you decide I am
[1:44:59] going to obey the
[1:45:01] word clap your hands oh ye people and
[1:45:05] Shout To God with a voice of
[1:45:10] Triumph now so many people I've watched
[1:45:14] it now Through The
[1:45:16] Years people have rather than saying
[1:45:19] amen have gone to clapping their
[1:45:29] hands this is not an
[1:45:36] amen the amen comes out of your
[1:45:39] mouth the amen comes by the way you
[1:45:42] live but the Bible says to clap your
[1:45:45] hands and Shout To God with a voice of
[1:45:49] Triumph that's right it's a combination
[1:45:53] of clapping our hands and and and you
[1:45:56] can watch people sometimes you can tell
[1:45:58] how uh how uh it's it's it's real
[1:46:02] obvious on
[1:46:05] videos you all do know we're on video
[1:46:09] right and sometimes the video captures
[1:46:13] us when everybody else is jubilant and
[1:46:17] they're clapping with all their might
[1:46:18] and somebody's doing this
[1:46:31] but if we'll clap our
[1:46:32] hands like we really mean it we may not
[1:46:37] feel it when we start but if our hearts
[1:46:41] are tuned toward the Lord that clap can
[1:46:45] become something just the same as when
[1:46:49] your voices were lifted when the when
[1:46:51] the chofar was blown and your voices
[1:46:54] were lifted and something moved in the
[1:46:58] atmosphere that is what can happen if we
[1:47:01] engage in what God has done for us and
[1:47:05] is doing for
[1:47:07] us we have all had and heard profound
[1:47:11] revelatory words through our through our
[1:47:15] uh existence through our Christian walk
[1:47:17] and God called us and he gave us
[1:47:20] salvation and we heard the when when we
[1:47:23] first heard that we could make Heaven
[1:47:26] our home and there was something that
[1:47:27] Drew us and we called on the name of the
[1:47:30] Lord and we didn't want to stop there
[1:47:32] but yet we heard that there was a
[1:47:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost that would
[1:47:37] give us power in the spirit and it would
[1:47:40] give us leadership along the way we kept
[1:47:42] pressing toward that and then after we
[1:47:45] received the Holy Spirit maybe there was
[1:47:48] a time where we didn't really feel like
[1:47:51] that initial time and we wondered God
[1:47:54] have you left me and and we just found
[1:47:58] ourselves reverting back to other
[1:48:02] things we've heard truths of how the
[1:48:05] Lord was going to touch us in our in our
[1:48:07] health with the Divine Way and how he
[1:48:09] was going to come in a completion with
[1:48:12] authority and the bride and the end time
[1:48:15] and how that she was going to have that
[1:48:16] authority to to speak missing limbs into
[1:48:20] existence that we're not there and we've
[1:48:23] heard these Revelations about uh what is
[1:48:26] written on the backside of the book and
[1:48:28] the revelation of the seven Thunders and
[1:48:30] we're still waiting and
[1:48:38] anticipating I believe that there are
[1:48:40] still things that the bride has yet to
[1:48:49] understand
[1:48:50] because I heard him say you
[1:48:54] wait until the revelation of those seven
[1:48:56] unknown
[1:48:58] Thunders that will be what will shake
[1:49:00] the bride into her
[1:49:03] position I'm I've not found it
[1:49:09] yet and we get impatient because we're
[1:49:12] not seeing what we want to
[1:49:14] see and I know that we ought to be in
[1:49:18] Revival every day of our life lives we
[1:49:21] ought to have that kind of an
[1:49:23] anticipation of what God's going to do
[1:49:25] but we are not there
[1:49:30] yet
[1:49:32] yet
[1:49:36] yet and I am not throwing cold water on
[1:49:39] us as a group of people no no no no
[1:49:42] because I see it all around the world
[1:49:45] all the little sneak peeks on streaming
[1:49:47] that I watch around the world I'm seeing
[1:49:50] the same thing people are looking for
[1:49:53] the manifestation of the sons of
[1:50:02] God James 1:3 again be assured and
[1:50:05] understand that the trial and proving of
[1:50:08] your faith bring out endurance and
[1:50:11] steadfastness and
[1:50:13] patience
[1:50:15] so the trying of your faith is to bring
[1:50:20] out
[1:50:22] endurance which then
[1:50:24] brings
[1:50:26] Perfection and full
[1:50:28] development with no defects no
[1:50:34] defects so how can I overcome all of
[1:50:37] these
[1:50:42] things well I'm going to take you
[1:50:45] back to the Old Testament once
[1:50:49] again because every one of us have had
[1:50:53] highs and
[1:50:56] lows even the
[1:51:03] preachers for
[1:51:05] every level that God lets you step
[1:51:10] up what was it we used to hear new
[1:51:12] levels new
[1:51:16] Devils so every level you step up you
[1:51:21] are
[1:51:23] increasing fiery
[1:51:28] darts yet by the grace of
[1:51:31] God we have been given tools to
[1:51:35] overcome
[1:51:37] so in 1st Samuel
[1:51:40] 26 David is running from
[1:51:43] Saul 1 Samuel 27 David is still running
[1:51:48] from Saul and he ends up in the land of
[1:51:52] gath
[1:51:54] remember the giant that he
[1:51:57] fought Goliath of
[1:52:02] gath and David ends up running from Saul
[1:52:08] and going to the land of gath and there
[1:52:12] he dwelt for 16
[1:52:14] months 1st Samuel 28 akish of the
[1:52:18] Philistines let David know that they're
[1:52:20] going to war and he expects David to
[1:52:25] help now just remind you this is the
[1:52:28] chapter where that uh Saul because God
[1:52:32] has withdrew himself from him Saul goes
[1:52:36] to the witch of Endor to try to get some
[1:52:39] help to know how to take his next step
[1:52:43] that is what happens to us when we do
[1:52:47] not listen to the Lord
[1:52:50] and it's what happens to us when we find
[1:52:53] ourself and we can't hear we revert to
[1:52:56] old
[1:53:01] ways now when he consulted This Witch
[1:53:05] Samuel let him KN know what was about to
[1:53:07] happen in the
[1:53:09] battle 1st Samuel 29 David goes out to
[1:53:13] the battle with the Philistines but he
[1:53:15] is dismissed can you
[1:53:18] imagine David has fought against the
[1:53:21] Philistines he comes back to the he
[1:53:23] comes back to the uh the camp and the
[1:53:26] women start saying after him Saul has
[1:53:29] killed his thousands but David has
[1:53:32] killed his 10
[1:53:46] thousands I guess it would make Saul
[1:53:48] pretty mad
[1:53:56] but here David is with the Philistines
[1:53:59] going out to
[1:54:01] fight but the
[1:54:04] Philistines
[1:54:06] somehow recognize who he is and they say
[1:54:10] isn't this the guy that they were
[1:54:13] singing
[1:54:14] about something along the lines of Saul
[1:54:17] killed his thousands and this guy killed
[1:54:20] his 10,000s I'm not so sure that we want
[1:54:23] him fighting with us because he might
[1:54:25] turn on
[1:54:27] us and they sent him back to the camp
[1:54:30] and when 1st Samuel chapter 30 when
[1:54:34] David gets back and his men they
[1:54:36] returned to ziklag now remember in
[1:54:39] ziklag David lived with his men and they
[1:54:42] had their wives and there were children
[1:54:44] and so forth and they had houses and
[1:54:46] when they he and his men got back to
[1:54:48] ziklag
[1:54:50] they found that their wives and their
[1:54:53] children had been taken away and the
[1:54:55] houses had been
[1:54:59] burned
[1:55:02] now I find it very interesting if you
[1:55:06] remember when
[1:55:08] Saul was told to go and kill all of the
[1:55:16] amalekites
[1:55:18] and Sam came to Saul and said
[1:55:22] Saul what is this that I hear the
[1:55:26] blading of the
[1:55:28] sheep and Saul says well the people
[1:55:31] wanted all of that to be able to
[1:55:33] sacrifice to the lord it's just the
[1:55:38] animals and I've also spared King
[1:55:42] AAG but everybody else I've
[1:55:46] killed and so it is very interesting
[1:55:49] when when you get to 1st Samuel chapter
[1:55:51] 30 and you find out who burned
[1:55:58] ziklag the
[1:56:01] amalekites Saul I thought you said you
[1:56:03] took care of all the amalekites except
[1:56:06] for AAG and AAG was hun into pieces by
[1:56:08] the prophet
[1:56:10] Samuel but here we have the
[1:56:12] amalekites burn and
[1:56:17] ziklag and David was in
[1:56:22] distress he's running from
[1:56:24] Saul the Philistines don't want him in
[1:56:27] their army he goes back to try to get to
[1:56:31] his wife and his men to their wives and
[1:56:34] the city is burned and the women and the
[1:56:36] children are missing and now David is
[1:56:40] standing there and his own men want to
[1:56:43] Stone
[1:56:45] him because their wives have been stolen
[1:56:48] away by the
[1:56:52] amalekites but the Bible tells us that
[1:56:55] David encouraged himself in the
[1:57:01] Lord what does it look like to encourage
[1:57:04] yourself in the
[1:57:08] Lord and somehow with David I kind of
[1:57:11] feel like it went kind of like this as
[1:57:15] his men are standing around him and
[1:57:17] probably crying thinking about what is
[1:57:20] happening to their wives the same as
[1:57:23] there are some men in Israel right
[1:57:30] now whose wives and children have been
[1:57:33] taken away
[1:57:35] captive and they don't know where
[1:57:37] they're at or what is being done to
[1:57:42] them and I just imagine that David stood
[1:57:45] there for just a
[1:57:47] moment but all of of the sudden there
[1:57:50] was something that dropped into him
[1:57:54] Lord when I was a younger
[1:57:57] man and I was watching over my father's
[1:58:01] sheep there was a lion that came and
[1:58:04] wanted to rip my sheep in pieces and
[1:58:07] Destroy them but somehow you gave me the
[1:58:10] strength to grab him by the beard and
[1:58:12] kill him and you also gave me that same
[1:58:16] kind of strength when a bear was going
[1:58:18] to do the same thing thing when the Paw
[1:58:20] of the bear was about to take out one of
[1:58:22] my sheep and somehow God you gave me the
[1:58:25] strength that to be able to to kill
[1:58:29] those two and Lord I also want to remind
[1:58:33] you that I was out in that sheep pasture
[1:58:36] and I was minding my own business and
[1:58:40] you you had already taken your hand off
[1:58:43] of Saul and you sent the prophet Samuel
[1:58:46] to my daddy's house and when you sent
[1:58:49] him to my daddy's Daddy's house I was
[1:58:51] just out in the sheep field watching
[1:58:54] over my sheep and all my brothers were
[1:58:56] at home but Samuel came down to the
[1:58:58] house and he was going to anoint a new
[1:59:01] king because you told him that it would
[1:59:03] be among the sons of Jessy and so Lord I
[1:59:07] was just minding my business and they
[1:59:10] came out after everyone Samuel had
[1:59:13] looked over all of my brothers and you
[1:59:16] chose me out of all of my brother
[1:59:19] Brothers to be king and Samuel when I
[1:59:22] came into the house Samuel poured that
[1:59:25] horn of
[1:59:26] oil over my head and he said you're the
[1:59:29] next king of
[1:59:31] Israel
[1:59:33] Lord I didn't ask for that
[1:59:36] position but you're the one that said it
[1:59:39] I was minding my own business but you
[1:59:42] are the one that anointed me to be the
[1:59:45] next king and here I am running from I'm
[1:59:47] running from Saul but I'm still to be
[1:59:50] the next king and Lord I want to also
[1:59:53] remind you that when when Saul was in a
[1:59:58] place where that he couldn't get a hold
[1:59:59] of you I went and I played my harp and I
[2:00:02] sang to try to calm the demon spirits
[2:00:05] that were in him but Lord I also want to
[2:00:08] remind you that somehow when my brothers
[2:00:12] and all of the army of Israel they were
[2:00:15] scared of
[2:00:17] Goliath there was something that when I
[2:00:20] went down to the camp and I saw that all
[2:00:23] of them were afraid to fight Goliath
[2:00:26] there was something that came over me
[2:00:28] Lord and you gave me the strength to not
[2:00:31] be afraid you took all of the fear out
[2:00:34] of my life and you gave me the courage
[2:00:38] to go down to that Brook and to get five
[2:00:41] smooth
[2:00:43] stones to pick up those
[2:00:45] [Music]
[2:00:47] stones you gave me the C en courage Lord
[2:00:50] when that giant lifted his voice and it
[2:00:54] rumbled and reverberated through that
[2:00:56] Valley enough to shake every one of my
[2:00:59] brothers it did not Shake Me Lord
[2:01:03] because you gave me the courage that I
[2:01:05] didn't necessarily have but you gave me
[2:01:08] the courage and David's just reminding
[2:01:10] the Lord of all of those things that he
[2:01:12] is already done for him all those things
[2:01:15] that he's already done on his behalf
[2:01:17] even though right now all around him is
[2:01:20] a mess the women are gone they don't
[2:01:22] know where they're at his men are ready
[2:01:23] to Stone him but David encouraged
[2:01:25] himself in the Lord because David was
[2:01:28] running his race with patience he had
[2:01:31] already been anointed
[2:01:36] king you have already been anointed
[2:01:41] bride he had already been anointed king
[2:01:44] but he was still running from
[2:01:48] Saul
[2:01:51] you have been
[2:01:52] anointed as priests and Kings but you're
[2:01:55] still defeating devils in your life
[2:01:58] you're still putting them down run this
[2:02:01] race with patience the race that is set
[2:02:04] before you encourage yourself and the
[2:02:06] Lord how do I do that brother remind the
[2:02:09] Lord and the
[2:02:12] devil of all of the times that God has
[2:02:16] come through for you remind him of your
[2:02:20] salvation remind him of your Holy Ghost
[2:02:23] experience remind him of the refilling
[2:02:26] that God has given you along the way
[2:02:29] remind
[2:02:31] him
[2:02:33] who the devil yeah God yeah remind both
[2:02:39] of them right does God need reminding
[2:02:42] probably not does the devil need
[2:02:45] reminding probably
[2:02:47] not I think he's probably probably still
[2:02:49] nursing the
[2:02:52] wounds of when some of us got
[2:02:56] delivered yes sir and he's pulled and
[2:02:59] he's yanked and he's jerked and he's
[2:03:01] pulled and he's yanked and he's jerked
[2:03:04] trying to get you to get back to the
[2:03:06] place where you once were he's trying to
[2:03:09] get you to take your eyes off of Jesus
[2:03:11] and get your eyes on your circumstances
[2:03:14] and he's trying to get you to be
[2:03:16] impatient with your journey so that
[2:03:18] you'll quit and go back to Egypt that
[2:03:20] you'll try to find a leader that will
[2:03:22] take you back to
[2:03:25] Egypt but run this race with
[2:03:28] patience run this race with patience the
[2:03:31] race that is set before you looking unto
[2:03:34] Jesus and away from your
[2:03:36] circumstances looking away from your
[2:03:40] circumstances and unto Jesus who is the
[2:03:42] author and the finisher of your
[2:03:47] faith
[2:03:52] after a
[2:03:54] while David encouraging himself in the
[2:03:58] Lord he calls for brother priest abathar
[2:04:02] bring me the ephod abar bring me the
[2:04:05] ephod Lord what's my next step what is
[2:04:08] my next step I'm now encouraged my men
[2:04:11] haven't stoned me I'm encouraged in the
[2:04:14] Lord as I've reminded you Lord of what
[2:04:16] you have done in the past and and I've
[2:04:19] reminded the enemy of what uh uh the
[2:04:21] Lord has done in the past and it's just
[2:04:23] kind of Built Me Up Inside as I remember
[2:04:26] as I remember and so I'm not going to
[2:04:28] stay here and let the men Stone me I'm
[2:04:30] not going to stay here and worry about
[2:04:33] what they might do next but I'm going to
[2:04:35] inquire of the Lord what should I do
[2:04:39] next you
[2:04:41] know that training process for
[2:04:44] David was not easy process
[2:04:51] I just like to read Psalm 95 to
[2:04:55] you oh
[2:04:57] come let us sing unto the Lord let us
[2:05:00] Make a Joyful Noise to the rock of our
[2:05:03] Salvation let us come before his
[2:05:06] presence with Thanksgiving and Make a
[2:05:07] Joyful Noise unto him with Psalms for
[2:05:10] the Lord is great and great king above
[2:05:13] all gods in his hand are the Deep places
[2:05:16] of of the Earth the strength of of the
[2:05:19] hills also is his also the sea is his
[2:05:23] and he made it and His Hands formed the
[2:05:25] dry land oh come let us worship and bow
[2:05:30] down let us kneel before the Lord our
[2:05:34] maker for he is our God and we are the
[2:05:37] people of his pasture the Sheep of his
[2:05:41] hand
[2:05:43] today if you will hear his
[2:05:46] voice now why would David all the
[2:05:49] sudden why would David all of the sudden
[2:05:53] in the middle of praising the Lord be
[2:05:56] reminded of a Time
[2:05:58] past his
[2:06:01] ancestors who were in maybe the same
[2:06:03] kind of predicament that he was and he's
[2:06:07] remembering what happened to them and he
[2:06:09] says today if you'll hear his voice
[2:06:11] Harden not your heart as in the
[2:06:13] provocation and is a day of Temptation
[2:06:16] in the wilderness when your fathers
[2:06:17] tempted me proved me and saw my work 40
[2:06:22] years long was I grieved with this
[2:06:24] generation and said it is a people that
[2:06:26] do air in their heart they have not
[2:06:28] known my ways unto whom I swear in my
[2:06:31] wrath that they should not enter into my
[2:06:34] rest we look in this chapter and we see
[2:06:38] the contrast of the heart of praise
[2:06:40] that's coming out of David the heart of
[2:06:43] thankfulness that is coming out of him
[2:06:46] be and the because that he doesn't want
[2:06:48] want to find himself trapped in the same
[2:06:51] way that the children of Israel hardened
[2:06:54] their hearts in murmuring and
[2:06:56] complaining and had to go in the
[2:06:58] wilderness for 40 long years because of
[2:07:01] their murmurings and
[2:07:05] complainings
[2:07:07] yes David got himself into trouble with
[2:07:10] his
[2:07:11] folly but he always came back with a
[2:07:13] Heart of Thanksgiving with a heart of
[2:07:16] repentance to the Lord
[2:07:20] as the musicians are coming today I
[2:07:23] would just like to remind
[2:07:26] you of a vision that our brother
[2:07:29] brandham
[2:07:31] had this is
[2:07:35] found the Rapture message
[2:07:39] 1965 I remember that night before I'd
[2:07:41] seen that I seen the preview of the
[2:07:44] Bride I stood there and seen a beautiful
[2:07:46] little lady just correctly dressed
[2:07:48] dressed and things marching this way
[2:07:52] there was somebody standing by me in the
[2:07:54] vision and I seen they said the preview
[2:07:58] of the
[2:07:59] Bride I seen her go by they come on this
[2:08:02] side and went around I heard it coming
[2:08:05] up the church is coming from this other
[2:08:08] side there come the Asian Church oh you
[2:08:11] talk about
[2:08:13] filth here come the European Church oh
[2:08:16] my and then I heard rock and roll coming
[2:08:19] it was Miss America the church and she
[2:08:22] didn't even have on any
[2:08:25] clothes she had papers like
[2:08:28] newspapers gray holding in front of her
[2:08:33] dancing by rock and roll Miss America
[2:08:37] the
[2:08:38] church I stood there in his presence I
[2:08:41] thought oh God as a minister if that's
[2:08:44] the best we can
[2:08:46] do oh oh you know how it feels then I
[2:08:51] thought God hide me if I could just get
[2:08:53] away from here if that's all we've done
[2:08:54] and that's what we have to produce if
[2:08:57] that's what and then when them women
[2:09:00] passed by all doing kinds rocking rocks
[2:09:03] and things short hair painted
[2:09:07] faces and as they passed by like that
[2:09:10] supposed to be virgins to Christ and
[2:09:12] when she passed by like that I turned my
[2:09:15] head you know with this holding in front
[2:09:18] of
[2:09:19] me it was disgraceful the back of them
[2:09:23] and there they was going like that and I
[2:09:24] turned my head to weeping like that I
[2:09:28] said I can't couldn't stand it there him
[2:09:31] standing there and me know that me a
[2:09:33] minister of the church and that's what
[2:09:34] I'd produced for him I said oh God I
[2:09:37] can't look at it let me die let me fade
[2:09:40] away like that as soon as it come out
[2:09:44] every time one of them would come they'd
[2:09:45] go to a certain place and drop off I
[2:09:48] just hear the sound of it as it went
[2:09:51] away then I heard something like Onward
[2:09:54] Christian Soldiers I looked and here
[2:09:57] come that sainted bunch of little girls
[2:09:59] just exactly the way they was all
[2:10:02] correctly dressed their hair hanging way
[2:10:05] down their back smooth clean marching
[2:10:10] like this to the step of the Gospel she
[2:10:14] was the word they look like one out of
[2:10:18] Every
[2:10:19] Nation I was looking as they went by and
[2:10:22] seen them pass by instead of going down
[2:10:25] they started going up I noticed one of
[2:10:27] them trying two or three times trying
[2:10:30] getting out of line I screamed stay in
[2:10:35] line the vision left me and I was
[2:10:38] standing in the room screaming stay in
[2:10:43] line oh
[2:10:46] friends were we a part of that that he
[2:10:53] saw when we get
[2:10:56] impatient and we gravitate back to
[2:10:59] things that we let go of in the
[2:11:01] past just to bide our
[2:11:05] time because we don't feel like anything
[2:11:08] is happening are we one of those that
[2:11:11] are getting out of line and there's a
[2:11:13] voice calling from eternity stay in line
[2:11:18] amen that's
[2:11:23] right one
[2:11:27] more from a message getting in the
[2:11:30] spirit 1961 what we need is not a
[2:11:33] psychology
[2:11:37] move but we need a holy spirit move into
[2:11:40] the church until the people cry out
[2:11:43] where is that God that once
[2:11:46] lived where is that God of
[2:11:49] Pentecost where is that God that takes
[2:11:52] Sinners heart and washes them white as
[2:11:54] snow who takes a prostitute from the
[2:11:57] street makes a lady out of her takes a
[2:12:00] drunkard out of the barroom out yonder
[2:12:02] makes a preacher out of him where is
[2:12:05] that God that can move out and take them
[2:12:07] crippled legs straighten them out make
[2:12:10] them blind eyes to see them deaf ears to
[2:12:13] hear make the cancer vanish away where
[2:12:16] is the god that did that one time that's
[2:12:20] it we found out that there's something
[2:12:24] wrong the other night as I was preaching
[2:12:26] on the subject of the news flash
[2:12:28] greatest news flash in history old John
[2:12:31] his eyes got the prophet John was kind
[2:12:34] of filmed over he was like he had the
[2:12:37] spirit of Elijah and Elijah had a
[2:12:39] breakdown when he was under the juniper
[2:12:42] tree so it's not unnatural
[2:12:46] friends it's not unnatural to have
[2:12:50] moments Elijah had a breakdown when he
[2:12:53] was under the juniper tree and John had
[2:12:55] a breakdown in the prison and he was a
[2:12:57] high pitched Prophet them nerves on edge
[2:13:00] and then his Eagle Eye filmed over and
[2:13:02] he said go see if I've been
[2:13:04] wrong ask him if he's the one or if we
[2:13:08] were supposed to look for
[2:13:11] another this is what caught my
[2:13:14] attention Jesus never sent him any book
[2:13:18] now here's how to have patience while
[2:13:19] you're in
[2:13:22] jail what did he say what did he tell
[2:13:25] him he said just watch in this
[2:13:27] afternoon's meeting then go show John
[2:13:29] the lame walk the blind sea John had
[2:13:32] preached the gospel that a messiah was
[2:13:34] coming he would fan his hand and
[2:13:36] thoroughly Purge the floor sure burn the
[2:13:40] chaff with unquenchable fire but when he
[2:13:42] come he was a little Meek fellow meek
[2:13:45] and lowly didn't meet up with what John
[2:13:47] thought it ought to be but he said you
[2:13:49] go D John I'm running right on schedule
[2:13:54] it's all right everything is all right
[2:13:58] we're not going to send him a book how
[2:14:00] to have patience in
[2:14:04] jail we're not going to send him that
[2:14:06] book and I'm not going to send you that
[2:14:09] book no matter how jailed you feel right
[2:14:13] now how locked in position you feel
[2:14:16] right now you don't need a book how to
[2:14:19] have patience in
[2:14:23] jail
[2:14:25] because we have already been told that
[2:14:28] the trying of our faith is going to
[2:14:32] bring about the patience that we
[2:14:37] need we heard here on Tuesday night
[2:14:39] about tribulation and
[2:14:42] patience we don't have to ask for
[2:14:44] patience because tribulation will surely
[2:14:47] come
[2:14:48] it's a part of our life it's a part of
[2:14:50] this
[2:14:51] journey and we're not going to get to
[2:14:54] our
[2:14:55] destination faster than the Lord has
[2:14:57] already ordained for us to be it is our
[2:15:00] job to be in position and not get out of
[2:15:04] Step it is our part to play to be a part
[2:15:10] of the body of Christ that God has
[2:15:12] called us to to be in church when we're
[2:15:15] supposed to be so that we don't miss a
[2:15:18] nugget that's going to be for this next
[2:15:20] week that we're going to need we want to
[2:15:22] have every part of the equipment that we
[2:15:25] need because we know that all of
[2:15:28] creation is
[2:15:30] groaning all of creation is groaning
[2:15:33] waiting for the
[2:15:34] manifestation of the sons of
[2:15:37] God
[2:15:39] and we may not yet see what we're hoping
[2:15:44] for but we
[2:15:46] wait the Amplified Romans 8:25 says but
[2:15:51] if we hope for what is still unseen by
[2:15:55] us we wait for it with
[2:15:58] patience and
[2:16:03] composure we don't have to get out of
[2:16:07] sorts we're
[2:16:09] waiting with patience and
[2:16:14] composure we're not going to rail
[2:16:16] Against One Another We're not going to
[2:16:18] rail against our pastor we're not going
[2:16:19] to rail against the word of God we're
[2:16:22] going to keep our composure and we're
[2:16:25] going to recognize that what I'm going
[2:16:27] through right this moment God ordained
[2:16:30] it because he knew that I needed it in
[2:16:34] order for me to be uh uh
[2:16:39] transformed into who I am supposed to be
[2:16:44] doesn't feel
[2:16:46] good fire generally
[2:16:48] doesn't but it is necessary for
[2:16:55] us knowing this as you're
[2:16:59] standing that the trying of your faith
[2:17:03] work as
[2:17:05] patience but let patience have her
[2:17:08] perfect work that you may be
[2:17:13] perfect and entire or
[2:17:16] complete
[2:17:18] wanting or lacking
[2:17:25] nothing would you bow your heads today
[2:17:35] please as we're coming to the
[2:17:38] completion of this service if you're
[2:17:41] here today and you feel like that you
[2:17:45] have been squeezed exceptionally hard
[2:17:49] this week and you would just like us to
[2:17:51] remember you in prayer would you just
[2:17:53] lift your
[2:17:54] hands all over the
[2:17:57] building you out on the stream God sees
[2:18:00] your hearts and your
[2:18:02] needs let's just pray together as they
[2:18:04] start playing something quietly
[2:18:09] father you see my brothers and my
[2:18:14] sisters as they have raised their hand I
[2:18:16] just want to thank you Lord that you are
[2:18:20] working on
[2:18:23] us if we felt
[2:18:26] all happy gol lucky and nothing was
[2:18:30] buffeting
[2:18:31] us there would probably be a problem
[2:18:36] somewhere but God I believe that you are
[2:18:39] trying to work in us both to Will and to
[2:18:42] do of your good pleasure to bring about
[2:18:45] the necessary pressure in our lives to
[2:18:50] move us to our next height that you've
[2:18:53] called us
[2:18:54] to so I hold my brothers and sisters up
[2:18:57] to you Lord asking that you would
[2:19:00] Minister to them to their needs God I
[2:19:03] pray that you will help them to see that
[2:19:06] they are not alone help them to see that
[2:19:09] they don't need to reach back to Egypt
[2:19:12] but they need to put their focus on you
[2:19:15] God even if it seems like that nothing
[2:19:17] nothing is moving I asking God that you
[2:19:20] will give them the grace to put their
[2:19:22] eyes on you when the Temptation is there
[2:19:27] to look back to Egypt I ask you God that
[2:19:30] you will give an extra Grace to grab a
[2:19:33] hold of the
[2:19:38] word by the power of the blood and

[2:19:44] Christ I decree this over my brothers
[2:19:47] and sisters sisters Satan you have lost
[2:19:50] the battle you have lost the
[2:19:55] battle and we decree over our brothers
[2:19:58] and sisters the glory of the Lord that
[2:20:01] will give them Grace to press all the
[2:20:04] way through Lord I Thank you that you
[2:20:08] give us Grace and you give us the
