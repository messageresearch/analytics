[0:10] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:14] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:17] the realm of the Spirit
[0:19] [Music]
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:37] is surrendering our mind to the water
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference is
[0:41] the great mystery right at Christ in you
[0:44] the hope of north
[0:45] [Music]
[1:00] hello this is Pastor Steven Shelley from
[1:04] new hope revival ministries in Smith
[1:06] Station Alabama I consider it an
[1:09] incredible honor to be able to partner
[1:11] with brother Eric Erickson and the
[1:14] gospel channel what a wonderful work of
[1:17] the Lord they're doing in this time
[1:20] reaching out all across the United
[1:23] Kingdom across Scandinavia across
[1:26] Iceland and into many other areas of the
[1:30] world and thanks be to God it's a
[1:32] ministry that's not only being
[1:34] maintained but it's a ministry that's
[1:36] growing and I just feel so blessed to be
[1:40] able to partner with them and to produce
[1:42] programs here in her little studio that
[1:45] the Lord has blessed us with to help
[1:47] them when there are times if they need a
[1:49] program it's so wonderful I mean I'd
[1:52] rather be in Iceland sometimes sitting
[1:55] down with them I've had incredible times
[1:57] around the table with brother Erickson
[2:00] brother good Munder and so many of the
[2:02] precious brothers that you're used to
[2:04] seeing there on the gospel Channel but
[2:07] it's not always possible to fly to
[2:09] Iceland every time I have something on
[2:12] my heart so the Lord has certainly done
[2:14] a great work for us and giving us this
[2:17] studio my heart like the like the heart
[2:21] and the vision of the gospel channel of
[2:23] course is to reach souls to reach the
[2:26] unreached those who have never trusted
[2:28] Jesus as their Lord and Savior but I
[2:31] have another burden in my heart and that
[2:34] is to encourage the believers those who
[2:37] already believe those of you who have
[2:40] already invited the Lord Jesus into your
[2:43] life and you've been walking with him
[2:45] some of you for many many years now and
[2:48] others you're just beginning your
[2:49] journey and I know how easy it is in the
[2:53] day that we live in - to grow
[2:55] discouraged it's not that we're ever
[2:59] dissatisfied with the Lord he is
[3:01] faithful he is true he
[3:04] dependable he is a friend that sticketh
[3:06] closer than a brother but sometimes just
[3:09] the pressures of life the circumstances
[3:12] family pressure job pressure paying bill
[3:16] pressure it can get the best of us
[3:18] sometimes even sometimes when maybe
[3:22] there's a little bit of strife in the
[3:23] church or we're just not seeing the
[3:27] things that we've been believing for and
[3:29] hoping for we get a little of that Hope
[3:31] deferred and we need to be encouraged
[3:33] that's one of the reasons why I'm so
[3:36] excited about this opportunity to be
[3:38] able to come to you to help them out and
[3:41] also you see our other programs here on
[3:44] the gospel channel including the ego
[3:46] scribe but this is an opportunity to
[3:49] speak to you to encourage you to lift
[3:51] you up I want to thank you for your
[3:53] phone calls your emails both with prayer
[3:56] requests and also those god bless yous
[3:59] just to say we saw the program and we
[4:02] were incredibly blessed we're seeing God
[4:04] move to answer prayer and we're so
[4:08] thankful for that and so we just want to
[4:10] invite you to call to email to send in
[4:13] your prayer request because we take it
[4:16] seriously
[4:16] we believe in the power of prayer and I
[4:20] want to say happy New Year to you we are
[4:23] now in a brand spanking new year I hope
[4:27] you understand that southern lingo we're
[4:30] in a brand new year we've never lived in
[4:33] 2018 we've never served the Lord in 2018
[4:37] until now
[4:39] 2017 is behind us it's history there may
[4:42] be things in the last year that you and
[4:45] I would like to go back and change or do
[4:47] differently perhaps we'd like to live a
[4:49] more dedicated life or maybe you made
[4:52] mistakes maybe there were failures maybe
[4:55] you had some losses in 2017 and you
[4:58] would like to go back and set that ride
[5:00] and straighten it out but I want you to
[5:02] know that many times it's not possible
[5:05] we do everything that we can to right
[5:08] our wrongs to get up when we fall to
[5:10] dust ourselves off and get back on the
[5:13] trail and and press forward and we'd
[5:16] like to go back
[5:17] can undo and and redo but sometimes it's
[5:21] possible and other times it's just
[5:23] simply not possible but we serve a great
[5:26] big gracious loving God and he sees our
[5:30] heart and you know before we ever walk
[5:33] in the test he already knows he knows
[5:36] how we're going to succeed and how we're
[5:39] going to fail how we're going to press
[5:41] on and maybe sometimes stumble he sees
[5:44] it the test of the Lord and the trials
[5:47] that the Lord allows us to go through
[5:49] they are never so that the Lord can see
[5:52] what we will do sometimes we hear people
[5:55] describing the pressures and trials of
[5:57] life and they'll say it that way they'll
[5:59] say you know the Lord tests us so that
[6:02] he can see our heart so that he can
[6:04] prove our heart and what's going on in
[6:06] their lives but I want you to know
[6:07] that's not exactly how I see the
[6:10] scripture I believe that before I ever
[6:12] walked through the valley before I ever
[6:15] go through the fire before I ever begin
[6:18] the trial the Lord our God who is
[6:20] sovereign who knows all things he knows
[6:23] exactly how I'm going to behave he knows
[6:27] how I'm going to prove and show my
[6:28] strengths and he knows about my
[6:31] weaknesses that may creep up into the
[6:33] situation as well so he doesn't test me
[6:37] or allow me to have trials so that he
[6:40] can figure out who I am he often does it
[6:43] so that I can see my own heart sometimes
[6:47] we feel like that we have dealt with all
[6:49] the pride issues or we have dealt with
[6:51] all the jealousy issues or or whatever
[6:54] your personal issues have been on your
[6:56] journey we just feel like we've overcome
[6:58] it we've moved on and then we walk
[7:00] through another trial and some of the
[7:02] stuff that we felt like we'd placed
[7:04] under the blood perhaps even receive
[7:06] some deliverance from it creeps up again
[7:09] so your tests your trials your valleys
[7:13] are so that you can see your heart so
[7:17] that you can see your reaction so that
[7:20] you can deal again with the things that
[7:22] need to be dealt with and so that you
[7:25] can give everything that you can't
[7:27] change to the Lord who is sovereign who
[7:30] is gracious
[7:31] and who can not only change
[7:33] circumstances he can redeem our losses
[7:35] he can redeem our mistakes he can
[7:39] strengthen and help us in our
[7:40] shortcomings it's so wonderful to see
[7:43] the grace of God in our lives
[7:46] in areas where we have been so weak and
[7:49] we invite God to come in and help us and
[7:51] he does and instead of the weakness
[7:54] that's been there we actually see the
[7:56] Lord's strength we see his hand you know
[7:59] the hand of the Lord is ever upon the
[8:01] believer we may not always see his hand
[8:05] we may not always even feel his hand but
[8:09] it's there he never leaves us alone we
[8:13] are never alone we are not a people
[8:15] forsaken we are a people well loved and
[8:19] well cared for if we've surrendered our
[8:22] lives to the Lord but it's like the poem
[8:24] footprints in the sand sometimes when we
[8:27] go back over our lives ups and downs we
[8:31] only see one set of footprints in the
[8:33] sand it's so quick to say where were you
[8:36] Lord you left me you deserted me there I
[8:40] was struggling all alone but he has
[8:43] another explanation for the fact that
[8:45] there are only one set of footprints in
[8:48] the sand
[8:49] in fact what he says to us is those
[8:52] aren't your footprints those are mine it
[8:55] was in those darkest moments it was in
[8:58] those deepest trials that I was carrying
[9:02] you hey you were on my back he had the
[9:06] hardest part of the partnership he was
[9:09] literally carrying us through the trial
[9:11] and I don't know about you but as I'm
[9:14] speaking to you today my mind is running
[9:16] and I'm thinking very quickly about many
[9:20] many times when I know that I only got
[9:23] through the valley or I only crossed
[9:26] ahead or moved into something new and
[9:29] different because the Lord was carrying
[9:32] me it was certainly not my own strength
[9:34] it certainly wasn't my good looks it
[9:38] certainly wasn't my talents or gifts it
[9:40] was all by the grace of God so I just
[9:43] want to say happy
[9:45] New Year to you I want to I want to
[9:47] remind you that it's 12 months ahead
[9:51] depending on when you see this program
[9:53] that we can determine to give God
[9:58] everything that he has desired from us
[10:01] for so long and that begins in the heart
[10:04] that doesn't begin in our behavior or in
[10:08] our discipline to do good that begins in
[10:11] her heart that's what he's after he
[10:14] wants a place where he can come and live
[10:16] and dwell inside of us and have complete
[10:21] control that's the spirit walk
[10:25] that's the spirit life it may not be the
[10:28] easiest life but it's the most amazing
[10:31] so I encourage you no matter what 2017
[10:35] was like hey not even the first few days
[10:38] of 2018 maybe things have not been going
[10:41] well for you already in the new year and
[10:44] you're already determining that this
[10:46] year is gonna be a bust because things
[10:49] didn't go so well in the first few days
[10:51] well I want you to know a lot of that
[10:54] would depend on you I'm not just talking
[10:56] about the power of positive thinking
[10:58] I'm talking about walking through the
[11:00] pages of God's Word
[11:02] I'm talking about daily renewing our
[11:05] mind in him disagreeing with Satan's
[11:10] lies about who we are and coming into
[11:13] full into complete agreement with what
[11:16] God's Word has said about us I want to
[11:20] share some portions of Scripture with
[11:22] you today and I want you to when this
[11:25] program is finished and and you move on
[11:28] to the next program I want you to have
[11:31] realized that there is much promise and
[11:35] much hope for your life if you'll just
[11:39] surrender to him I want you to move away
[11:42] from this program thinking about the
[11:45] fact that you've got virgin territory to
[11:48] walk through you've got new experiences
[11:51] you'll have new circumstances this year
[11:55] things will change some things will stay
[11:57] the same
[11:58] God's grace and love for you will
[12:01] certainly be the same but you have a new
[12:04] opportunity a fresh opportunity to give
[12:08] God more of who you are and be used for
[12:11] his glory so turn your faith loose it's
[12:14] time to put our life where our testimony
[12:18] has always been we often say I want God
[12:22] to have my life I want to be completely
[12:24] yielded to him but we very carefully
[12:27] hold on to certain areas of our life
[12:30] that we're really not ready yet to walk
[12:34] with the Lord through those particular
[12:36] places in her heart I've come to a place
[12:39] now where I can't afford any longer to
[12:42] keep anything from him I want him to
[12:45] have it all I don't know if you know
[12:48] this or not but on the Hebrew calendar
[12:51] this is 57 78 on the Gregorian calendar
[12:54] its 2018 both the Hebrew year and the
[12:59] Gregorian year end in the number 8 which
[13:02] is the number of new beginnings
[13:05] I'm going to believe the Lord for a new
[13:08] beginning in your life if your health
[13:11] has been failing I'm going to believe
[13:13] him for a new beginning in the area of
[13:16] your health if your loved ones seem to
[13:19] be getting farther and farther away from
[13:21] God then I'm going to believe God with
[13:23] you that this will be the year of the
[13:26] beginning of their turnaround that God
[13:29] will woo them in such a way and call
[13:31] them in such a way that they will know
[13:34] that it's God that it's not just you and
[13:37] I hounding them because we love them and
[13:40] we want them to do right and serve the
[13:42] Lord I want them to know that God loves
[13:45] them that he's reaching for them I want
[13:49] them to know that this is not as much
[13:50] about joining church as it is about
[13:54] living every day with Jesus and I can
[13:58] tell you that the words to the old song
[14:00] are very very true every day with Jesus
[14:03] is sweeter than the day before I want to
[14:07] share some scriptures with you today and
[14:10] they're serious
[14:12] scriptures because again I I I believe
[14:15] the Lord is speaking to us about really
[14:18] letting our life line up with what we
[14:22] have testified let me just read you a
[14:26] paragraph I wasn't gonna read this but
[14:28] but let me just read you a paragraph
[14:30] that I wrote to share with my own local
[14:33] congregation and this was in our in what
[14:36] we call a watch night service as the old
[14:38] year is ending and the new year is
[14:40] beginning this is what the Lord inspired
[14:43] me to write we must choose now the life
[14:47] that we will live this year if we choose
[14:51] to live our natural lives it will be
[14:54] full of oppression and hopelessness but
[14:58] if we choose for the right reasons to
[15:01] live his life it will be the blessed
[15:05] life the supernatural life the Ascended
[15:10] life and I believe that with all my
[15:13] heart I believe that is the Lord's
[15:15] desire for his people in 2018 and that
[15:19] is that we choose to live his life when
[15:24] you invited the Lord Jesus Christ to
[15:26] come in by his Spirit and live in your
[15:29] heart to wash you with his blood to
[15:33] cleanse you to wash you by the water of
[15:36] his word sanctifying you and setting you
[15:39] apart for service many of you have
[15:41] experienced the baptism of the Holy
[15:43] Ghost
[15:44] which takes your walk with God up
[15:46] another level when we give Him surrender
[15:50] of our lives we now have the potential
[15:52] for his life to come and live through us
[15:57] but that means it's no longer my opinion
[16:01] it's no longer only my desire my dream
[16:04] my vision my goals it now has to become
[16:08] about his life his will his desire for
[16:12] me
[16:13] so I want to ask you to choose today as
[16:16] you're watching this program as you hear
[16:18] my words choose
[16:20] what life will you live in 2018 will you
[16:24] live the flesh life will you live the
[16:27] soul life which is from the realm of the
[16:30] mind and the will and the emotions or
[16:33] will you live the Jesus life the
[16:36] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[16:39] the realm of the Spirit where he sits on
[16:43] the control tower of your heart ready to
[16:46] lead ready to direct if you're ready to
[16:49] listen and I'm ready to listen I don't
[16:52] always get the listening part down pat
[16:54] but I'm working toward hearing his will
[16:58] before I do hearing his desire before I
[17:01] say this is something you can pray with
[17:04] me about and I'm going to pray with you
[17:07] that God will give you the same grace
[17:09] that I've been asking for in my life the
[17:12] one thing we need to be this year is
[17:14] authentic we need to be genuine we need
[17:19] to be everything that God has created us
[17:21] to be
[17:22] there's one thing that doesn't work
[17:24] really well in the end time that time
[17:27] we're living in right now and that's
[17:29] hypocrisy to say one thing and willfully
[17:34] do another and so we have to make some
[17:36] we have to make some commitments not
[17:38] resolutions we have to make some
[17:41] commitments we have to make some
[17:43] dedications to God in this new year of
[17:46] 5778
[17:47] or 2018 and we need to believe that
[17:51] there are new beginnings around every
[17:54] corner this year and in every one of
[17:56] those new beginnings let it be a step
[18:00] closer to living his life I choose why
[18:03] don't you say that right now I choose to
[18:07] live the supernatural life I choose to
[18:10] live the life of Jesus Christ I choose
[18:14] to live the Ascended life how do I do
[18:18] that I don't even know where to begin
[18:20] well it always begins in God's Word and
[18:25] when I say that I don't just mean
[18:27] reading the scripture because the
[18:29] scripture in printed form can be a
[18:32] deadly
[18:33] unless we invite the Spirit of the Lord
[18:35] to come in and quicken that word and
[18:38] make it alive to us that's gonna be one
[18:42] of my prayers for you in 2018 that the
[18:45] Spirit of God would rest so mightily
[18:49] upon your life that when you sit down to
[18:52] read the word though it's familiar to
[18:55] you because perhaps you've read it over
[18:57] and over again I'm going to believe that
[19:00] there will be a fresh new anointing on
[19:04] that word and that you will receive
[19:07] revelation and understanding from God's
[19:10] Word perhaps that you've never had
[19:12] before
[19:13] because I'm learning every year of my
[19:16] life that it's revelation that gives me
[19:20] strength to defeat the enemy when he
[19:23] comes around with all of his lies it's
[19:26] not a fake so anymore we've got to know
[19:29] that we know that we know that we know
[19:32] and so I'm going to believe that 2018
[19:35] will be a year of the supernatural life
[19:38] the year of the Ascended life and the
[19:41] year of the knowing that you know that
[19:43] you know that you know Matthew chapter 7
[19:47] beginning in verse 21 and reading
[19:52] through verse 23 it's Jesus it's red
[19:56] letters and it's important words for you
[19:59] and I right now
[20:01] he said not everyone that saith unto me
[20:05] Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom
[20:09] of heaven but he that doeth the will of
[20:14] my father which is in heaven many will
[20:20] say to me in that day Lord Lord have we
[20:24] not prophesied in thy name and in thy
[20:28] name have cast out devils and in thy
[20:31] name done many wonderful works and then
[20:36] will I profess unto them I never knew
[20:39] you depart from me ye that were
[20:46] iniquity I don't know if there are many
[20:51] more words in Scripture that that seem
[20:56] so convicting and a bit sad to realize
[21:01] that Jesus is speaking about a time when
[21:06] many will come before him Lord Lord
[21:10] calling on his name testifying that they
[21:14] love him testifying that he has saved
[21:17] them from their sins but because they
[21:20] are not willing to live the surrendered
[21:23] life which is a life of obedience if God
[21:27] requires something from us he provides
[21:31] the grace that we need the strength that
[21:34] we need to do whatever it is that he's
[21:37] asking us whatever he requires he
[21:41] provides for you and I have to make a
[21:44] choice and not just once and for all we
[21:48] have to make a daily choice and
[21:50] sometimes we have to make it all through
[21:52] the day we have to choose over and over
[21:56] and over again to say yes to the will of
[21:59] God for our lives to say yes to the Word
[22:03] of God for our lives and then let our
[22:06] behavior let the things we do the things
[22:09] we say also reflect what we have said
[22:13] before and that is that we are calling
[22:16] on the name of the Lord Jesus goes on to
[22:19] to talk about something that I think is
[22:22] is helpful in understanding the verses
[22:26] that we just read and now we're gonna
[22:30] read in verse 24 also a Matthew chapter
[22:34] 7 therefore whosoever heareth these
[22:38] sayings of mine and doeth them I will
[22:43] liken him unto a wise man which built
[22:46] his house upon a rock and the rain
[22:49] descended and the floods came and the
[22:52] winds blew and beat upon that house and
[22:56] it fell not for it was founded
[23:00] upon a rock verse 26 and every one that
[23:04] heareth these sayings of mine and doeth
[23:06] them not shall be likened unto a foolish
[23:10] man which built his house upon the sand
[23:13] and the rain descended and the floods
[23:17] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[23:20] the house and it fell and great was the
[23:25] fall of it Jesus was telling the
[23:29] disciples it's not enough just to say
[23:32] Lord Lord you must hear the sayings and
[23:35] do the sayings if you're hearing the
[23:39] scripture and you're and you're moving
[23:42] forward to do to obey to live a life of
[23:45] covenant with him it's like the man who
[23:48] built this house on a rock you're
[23:50] building it on Jesus you're building it
[23:53] on a solid foundation and no matter what
[23:56] comes you're gonna know that you have
[23:58] stability to weather the storm because
[24:01] you're built on truth I'm telling you
[24:04] when we build our lives on lies they're
[24:08] going to crumble but when we build our
[24:10] lives on the truth of God's Word there's
[24:13] not a storm that the enemy can whip up
[24:16] that will take you under your house can
[24:19] remain I mean it may shift a little the
[24:22] wind may blow you you may wonder how
[24:24] you're gonna weather the stormy night
[24:26] but I'm telling you when your life is
[24:29] founded on truth you're not going to
[24:32] fall God is going to sustain you another
[24:36] portion of Scripture that the Lord was
[24:38] was kind of highlighting for me a few
[24:41] weeks ago was in Luke 6 verse 46 and why
[24:45] call me Lord Lord and do not the things
[24:49] which I say you see it's not enough to
[24:53] call ourselves Christians we've got to
[24:56] look for the Christ life the life of
[25:00] obedience to the scripture John 14
[25:04] beautiful chapter verse 15 says if you
[25:09] love me you will keep my Commandments
[25:12] it's just
[25:13] simple I give you instruction if you
[25:16] love me you're gonna learn to obey my
[25:20] instructions verse 21 of the same
[25:23] chapter he that hath my Commandments and
[25:26] keepeth them he it is that loveth me and
[25:30] he that loveth me shall be loved of my
[25:33] father and I will love him and will
[25:36] manifest myself to him this isn't about
[25:39] making the grade are getting the score
[25:42] this isn't about every time always doing
[25:48] it the right way there are going to be
[25:51] times that we fail there are going to be
[25:53] times that we slip they're going to be
[25:56] times that thoughts come into our mind
[25:58] that are not godly thoughts maybe even
[26:01] words come out that are not faith words
[26:04] that are not words of hope and words of
[26:06] strength we're gonna make bad choices
[26:09] we're going to enter into relationships
[26:13] at times that we shouldn't but I'm
[26:15] telling you when your house is built on
[26:17] truth you have the Holy Spirit living
[26:19] inside of you to quickly come and not
[26:22] condemn you but to convict you I think
[26:26] it's time for believers to learn the
[26:29] difference between condemnation and
[26:31] conviction the enemy will condemn you
[26:34] and offer you no way out when the enemy
[26:37] puts guilt and condemnation on you
[26:40] because of your failures your
[26:41] shortcomings in life he never offers an
[26:45] opportunity to do better he only tells
[26:48] you how terribly you did now he doesn't
[26:53] say this is the way to do better you
[26:55] know if you'll do one two three you'll
[26:58] be strengthened in that area oh no he
[27:00] just makes it look like you're an
[27:02] eternal failure and that's all you're
[27:04] ever going to be so the guilt just keeps
[27:07] you from calling out for the Lord's help
[27:09] conviction it's when the Spirit of God
[27:11] comes in and says no that was not the
[27:15] best choice that was not the right
[27:17] decision it's time for you to run back
[27:20] to truth it's time to run back to the
[27:23] safety of the house that is built on
[27:26] the rock if we're going to say that we
[27:29] love the Lord it's going to be important
[27:32] in 2018 that we live for him that we
[27:36] make better choices better choices for
[27:39] our health better choices for our
[27:42] relationships better choices with the
[27:44] way we witness the words we speak the
[27:48] behavior the habits things that we know
[27:51] we need help with
[27:53] but sometimes feel ashamed to ask the
[27:56] Lord I want you to know you don't have
[27:58] to be ashamed you don't have to feel
[28:00] guilty you don't have to feel
[28:02] embarrassed to ask the Lord they help
[28:04] you he desires to make all things new in
[28:08] your life
[28:09] it requires repentance it requires
[28:12] saying Lord I messed up I'm sorry
[28:15] forgive me I need your strength I need
[28:19] your help because I'm not gonna stay
[28:21] down I'm gonna get up and I'm gonna move
[28:24] forward in this fresh new year that you
[28:27] have blessed me to live in you've given
[28:29] me another opportunity to do more than
[28:32] just call you Lord but to make you the
[28:36] Lord of my life in John 14 verse 23
[28:40] in fact just read the chapter mark it
[28:43] down make that part of your devotional
[28:45] time because both John 14 and 15 are
[28:49] powerful chapters jesus answered in
[28:52] verse 23 and said unto him if a man love
[28:54] me he will keep my words and my father
[28:59] will love him and we will come unto him
[29:02] and make our abode with him I gotta read
[29:06] that again jesus answered and said unto
[29:08] him if a man love me he will keep my
[29:12] words and my father will love him and we
[29:16] will come unto Him and make our abode
[29:18] with him Jesus was clear in the Gospels
[29:23] to tell us that his father lived inside
[29:26] of him he said when you've seen me you
[29:30] have seen the father for I and my father
[29:32] are
[29:33] he also taught us that this was the
[29:37] desire that he had for those who would
[29:39] come to follow him not only his
[29:41] disciples who lived in the same time
[29:45] period but his disciples that would live
[29:48] hundreds and yes even 2,000 years later
[29:52] his desire for you and I is the same
[29:55] desire that he had for his disciples in
[29:58] the Second Temple period and that is
[30:01] that we would allow him to come in and
[30:04] live inside of us he brings with him the
[30:08] eternal spirit of the Father that lived
[30:11] inside of him because God is a spirit
[30:13] here o Israel the Lord is one he is one
[30:18] spirit and when he comes in then we
[30:22] receive that beautiful union that he had
[30:26] with his father he wants that union with
[30:29] you and I he wants us to live in oneness
[30:33] in union with him this is how we began
[30:37] to discover the ascended life the
[30:41] supernatural life or that are the Jesus
[30:44] life we call it we begin to realize that
[30:47] there's a man in here there's a spirit
[30:50] man in here directing us leading us he
[30:56] wants to direct your feelings not only
[30:58] your thoughts he wants to direct your
[31:01] feelings he wants to direct every part
[31:04] of who you are it starts with a great
[31:06] big surrender but it continues daily
[31:10] minute by minute if necessary this is
[31:13] going to be a year that we must not just
[31:17] call him Lord but we must make him Lord
[31:20] in every area of our life in some of my
[31:28] studies I discovered that there was a
[31:30] poem that was written carved in a Gothic
[31:36] medieval alphabet on a towering ornate
[31:39] Cathedral door right in the heart of a
[31:43] small town in Germany from the looks of
[31:46] that
[31:47] or the words that are carved there could
[31:50] have perhaps been carved in the time of
[31:52] Martin Luther it's possible because of
[31:56] its vicinity that Martin Luther may have
[31:59] seen these words carved on the door it's
[32:05] a it's a very important poem it's somber
[32:14] it must have been a message to the
[32:17] church at that particular time but I
[32:22] think it's a message for the church
[32:25] today for the believer today perhaps
[32:27] even more appropriate for the hour that
[32:30] we're living in now then it was hundreds
[32:33] of years ago the poem is sometimes
[32:37] called it's it was translated to English
[32:40] and the translated title you'll find
[32:45] variations of the title but it's often
[32:48] translated to read the lament of Jesus
[32:51] Christ against the ungrateful world if I
[32:56] could leave a word for you that I
[32:58] believe would help revolutionize your
[33:01] life in 2018 it would be gratitude or
[33:05] gratefulness Thanksgiving I believe that
[33:10] and I've done some research for several
[33:13] years now and I just recently read an
[33:15] article just emphasizing what takes
[33:19] place in a in a scientific way in a
[33:23] biological way in our own bodies when we
[33:26] are thankful when we are grateful for
[33:30] what God has given us in our lives I've
[33:33] seen so many people suggesting that we
[33:37] make journals that we make a list of
[33:40] things every day that we're grateful for
[33:44] the one thing I've learned I can't tell
[33:47] you that I write it down every day but
[33:49] the times that I have I find myself
[33:53] glossing through the bad parts of the
[33:56] day the more stressful times of the day
[33:58] in my mind and phone
[34:00] focusing on those things that I am most
[34:03] thankful for we're racing teenagers my
[34:07] wife and I and so maybe at the end of
[34:10] the day there's been a little conflict
[34:12] or something in the home or it's usually
[34:15] a little bit of sibling rivalry if you
[34:17] know what I mean and so maybe you're I'm
[34:20] a little tired or less stressed or
[34:22] something and I'm I'm thinking oh my
[34:24] boys sometimes it's my girls I we have
[34:28] two of each and when I take that moment
[34:33] to start being thankful and grateful for
[34:35] their health for god blessing my wife
[34:39] and i with them for their personalities
[34:41] for the way they make us proud for the
[34:43] ways that they make us laugh for the
[34:47] ways that I see God working in their
[34:49] heart if I focus on that instead of the
[34:53] strife the mistakes that they might have
[34:56] made maybe coming home in their mother
[34:58] telling me that a couple of them really
[35:00] didn't want to do their school that day
[35:02] they're homeschooled all of that just
[35:05] fades when we focus on what we're
[35:08] grateful for for the blessing for the
[35:11] benefit that God has given us it is
[35:14] amazing how dim how dismal everything it
[35:17] just it's just our shrinking away the
[35:20] things that have cost us so much stress
[35:23] during the day they just lose their
[35:25] importance in the light of all the
[35:28] blessings and benefits of God in our
[35:30] life I want to read this point because
[35:33] it grieves me deeply to think about our
[35:36] Lord leaving this message to his church
[35:41] calling us an ungrateful world here's
[35:46] what the poem says thus speak if Christ
[35:50] our Lord to us you call me eternal then
[35:57] do not seek me you call me fair then do
[36:02] not love me you call me gracious then do
[36:07] not trust me you call me just then do
[36:11] not fear me
[36:13] you call me life then do not choose me
[36:17] you call me light then do not see me you
[36:23] call me Lord then do not respect me you
[36:27] call me master then do not obey me you
[36:31] call me merciful and then do not thank
[36:35] me you call me mighty then do not honor
[36:39] me you call me noble then do not serve
[36:44] me you call me rich then do not ask me
[36:48] you call me Savior then do not praise me
[36:52] you call me Shepherd then do not follow
[36:56] me you call me way then do not walk with
[37:00] me you call me wise then do not heed me
[37:04] you call me son of God then do not
[37:09] worship Me when I sentence you do not
[37:14] blame me I don't know if those words
[37:20] penetrate your life the way they
[37:23] penetrated mine it's a powerful way of
[37:28] summarizing the way the average person
[37:32] treats the Lord in a Christian nation we
[37:38] know that he's God we know that he's
[37:41] good we know that he's powerful we know
[37:44] that he's our Savior our Shepherd he's
[37:47] wise we know so many things about him
[37:50] and then we don't take the opportunity
[37:53] to let him demonstrate those things in
[37:56] our life if God is good then we we must
[38:01] learn to trust him if God is wise we
[38:05] need to heed his counsel if God is
[38:09] mighty then we need to honor him if he's
[38:12] noble we need to serve Him I just felt
[38:16] like the Lord let me find this point I I
[38:18] remember reading it many years ago it
[38:21] didn't have the impact on me at the time
[38:24] that it did just a few weeks ago and I
[38:27] found it again
[38:28] and I believe that the Lord knows what
[38:31] we need at the right time I just want to
[38:33] say to you wherever you are watching I
[38:36] believe that many of you know that God
[38:38] is good that he is God that there is one
[38:41] God over the earth I believe that many
[38:45] of you were raised in church and you've
[38:48] been to Sunday School and you know so
[38:50] many things about him and yet you
[38:52] realize when carefully listening to the
[38:56] words of this poem that we know more
[38:59] about him than we're allowing him to be
[39:02] in our own life if God is God over the
[39:07] whole earth then why not let him be God
[39:10] at your house if God is capable of
[39:13] watching over every person in the whole
[39:16] wide world at the same time then why
[39:18] don't we trust him to watch over our own
[39:21] families it's time to cause our belief
[39:27] system and and what we really believe to
[39:30] line up with what we've been saying not
[39:33] just calling him Lord Lord because we
[39:35] want to distinguish ourselves from other
[39:38] non-christian religions and so we say
[39:41] I'm a Christian I am of Christ you know
[39:44] that's what it means when we say I'm a
[39:46] Christian it means I am of Christ and
[39:50] and if we're of Christ then we must let
[39:54] him be the Messiah
[39:55] we must let him be the Anointed One in
[39:58] our life I'm just sensing so deeply that
[40:02] for many of you 2017 was a year that you
[40:07] would like to forget and many of you
[40:09] didn't enter into 2018 with much more
[40:13] hope your expectation was like it often
[40:18] can be in any of our lives that it would
[40:22] just be the same old same old another
[40:25] year of the of the grind but I want you
[40:28] to know that that God has an incredible
[40:31] plan for you in this season if you're
[40:35] willing to do
[40:37] more than call him Lord but then stop
[40:40] and let him be Lord God was stealing
[40:45] with me about that new beginning and he
[40:49] started bringing some words to my mind
[40:52] with a prefix of rhe which which
[40:57] generally means to do over and I begin
[41:03] to jot them down and and I'm claiming
[41:06] them for my own life for our own
[41:09] ministry for the families in our own
[41:11] faith community and I didn't know I was
[41:14] going to share them with you
[41:15] now but I'd like to do that restart
[41:18] rebuild renew recover refresh realign
[41:26] recommit rededicate reconnect reboot
[41:31] refocus recalibrate revive revamp
[41:37] reposition recheck rethink redefine
[41:42] redirect recreate reinvent re-energize
[41:47] reconsider rekindle regain revise rewire
[41:53] that was all on my list I'm sure they're
[41:57] more maybe you're already thinking of
[41:59] them if we have connected and that we do
[42:03] it again it's a reconnect if we if we
[42:07] are thinking and we start thinking that
[42:09] thought again we're rethinking that
[42:12] thought if we are making Corrections or
[42:16] changes on something that we've already
[42:18] put together we're revising it
[42:21] reconsidering it and rethinking it out I
[42:23] believe the Lord was just saying that
[42:26] 2018 is a year of possibilities a chance
[42:31] to walk back through some of the
[42:33] decisions that we have made and make
[42:35] some better decisions some better
[42:38] choices to recommit to rededicate our
[42:42] lives he was also talking to me in
[42:47] prayer about the new beginnings because
[42:49] we've been we ever
[42:50] time 1/8 comes up we use that that
[42:53] meaning new beginning but I felt like
[42:58] the Spirit of the Lord was talking to me
[42:59] about a different kind of new beginning
[43:03] it's not totally new what in the world
[43:07] do you mean by that it's a new beginning
[43:10] of things that have been sewn into your
[43:13] life in past seasons promises made
[43:18] endeavors that you started things that
[43:20] you that you felt like the Lord was
[43:23] leading you to and you and you stepped
[43:25] out in faith and in the right direction
[43:27] you begin to move forward and something
[43:30] happened and you gave up you abandoned
[43:34] the plan and I felt like the Lord was
[43:37] dealing with my heart that this would be
[43:40] a good opportunity in faith to reclaim
[43:43] some of those new beginnings of the past
[43:46] let those new beginnings become new
[43:49] again in 2018 things that were sewn into
[43:54] your life
[43:55] maybe words of promise visions goals
[43:58] dreams that you wanted to accomplish for
[44:01] the kingdom of God maybe it was
[44:04] children's ministry maybe it was
[44:06] ministry to the homeless maybe it was
[44:08] youth ministry and you stepped out and
[44:11] you began to make some steps in the
[44:13] right direction and then circumstances
[44:15] went awry and you gave up and you didn't
[44:19] feel like you would ever go back and
[44:20] revisit those visions those goals those
[44:23] those desires that you had for the
[44:25] kingdom of God I think maybe 2018 is
[44:29] going to be the year for you to go back
[44:31] and revisit to go back and reconnect
[44:34] with what the Lord is sewn into your
[44:36] life in times past I wrote it this way
[44:40] things that were sown and then sprouted
[44:42] and began to grow but were somehow later
[44:45] neglected abandoned or choked out I
[44:49] don't know what happened to the goal I
[44:52] don't know what happened to the vision
[44:53] especially if it was something that God
[44:55] was putting in your heart I don't know
[44:57] what changed I don't know how the enemy
[45:00] moved against you to try to steal
[45:02] from you what God was desiring to do in
[45:06] your life
[45:07] I obviously could not know all of those
[45:10] details but I do believe that 2018 can
[45:14] be a new beginning from an old new
[45:17] beginning something that didn't
[45:19] completely come to fruition it just just
[45:23] began to sprout and something happened
[45:26] and it was no more I'd like to see God
[45:30] restore that that passion that you had
[45:35] for the kingdom of God maybe for your
[45:38] own family maybe maybe as a father you
[45:41] you started out a few years ago to
[45:44] carefully disciple your children to
[45:46] train them in the things of God
[45:49] something changed on your job maybe you
[45:52] had less time you were more exhausted
[45:54] when you came home in the evening so so
[45:57] that little bit of growth that you began
[45:59] to see in your children it withered away
[46:02] because of circumstances and how they
[46:05] changed wouldn't this be a wonderful
[46:07] time to go back and redeem that new
[46:11] beginning you maybe you made a
[46:12] resolution maybe you made a commitment
[46:14] and you started out and it went good for
[46:17] for a few weeks maybe you said one night
[46:20] a week around the dinner table we're
[46:22] gonna really focus on the things of
[46:25] God's Word and the spirit life I'm gonna
[46:28] really talk to my family and I'm going
[46:30] to really share with them and see what I
[46:33] can do to help disciple them and and
[46:35] teach them about relationship and then
[46:38] things changed the schedules changed
[46:41] everybody's not home at the same time
[46:44] you're doing good to to all get dinner
[46:47] almost impossible to get it all at the
[46:50] same time I don't know what has happened
[46:52] but I want you to know that this would
[46:54] be a real opportunity to take a little
[46:58] mental inventory to say Lord in in what
[47:01] areas did I begin to move forward and
[47:04] something happened maybe the enemy just
[47:07] put up such a an assault against your
[47:11] life he was so angry about the
[47:15] change the choices that you were making
[47:17] your dedication and maybe he just called
[47:21] an all-out war against your family
[47:24] whatever it was I just don't believe
[47:27] it's too late if there were if there are
[47:30] certain circumstances that almost make
[47:33] it look impossible I still believe that
[47:36] out of the remains of what was a new
[47:40] beginning
[47:41] I believe God can revamp he can actually
[47:45] restructure that in 2018 so that it even
[47:49] goes higher than it would have ever gone
[47:53] before so that it accomplishes more than
[47:57] it would have ever accomplished in the
[47:59] beginning I just feel like Redemption is
[48:02] a good word to share with you in 2018
[48:06] whatever the enemy has stolen whatever
[48:09] the enemy has diverted in whatever area
[48:13] of your life the enemy has gotten in the
[48:16] arrangements he's God in the
[48:18] circumstances why don't we just in faith
[48:21] begin to speak confess God's word of
[48:25] restoration we see this amazing promise
[48:29] in the scripture concerning restoration
[48:33] of what the cankerworm and the Palmer
[48:35] worm and the locusts have eaten away we
[48:38] see that it was it was God restoring his
[48:42] truth back to a tree
[48:44] it was everything the enemy has stripped
[48:48] away and now God was restoring it layer
[48:52] by layer by layer that's redemption
[48:55] that's restoration that's God making
[48:58] restitution we've seen that throughout
[49:00] the church ages and I'd like to be able
[49:03] to say that I've seen that in my own
[49:05] life and I have indeed time and time
[49:08] again
[49:09] what about 2018 for you will you
[49:12] position your heart before the Lord
[49:15] right now will you commit to him I'm not
[49:19] just gonna be one who called you Lord
[49:21] Lord in this new year that you've given
[49:24] us but I'm going to be the one who makes
[49:26] you
[49:27] the Lord of my life instead of being so
[49:30] quick to do it my way I want to do it
[49:34] your way
[49:35] I want to be the man who's building or
[49:37] the woman who's building their house on
[49:40] a solid rock not just knowing truth but
[49:44] doing it not just knowing the
[49:47] instruction of the Lord but following
[49:49] his instruction one of the lines in the
[49:54] poem said you call me Shepherd but you
[49:58] do not follow me I I think that it would
[50:02] be so wonderful if in the few moments
[50:06] that we have left in the broadcast today
[50:09] we could just pray we could just say
[50:11] Lord I I'm sorry I'm sorry for the times
[50:16] that I testified you're the Good
[50:19] Shepherd Psalm 23 you know it's probably
[50:23] the most quoted or read portion of
[50:27] scripture at funerals many many times
[50:31] it's declared in a funeral over a life
[50:35] that has not let the Lord be the
[50:38] Shepherd of their life may it never be
[50:41] so about you may it never be so about
[50:45] any member of your family if if that
[50:48] would have been the way things were
[50:50] going in your life in 2017 let's
[50:53] determine that it will not be that way
[50:56] in this new year that the Lord has given
[50:58] us to serve Him
[50:59] we're gonna call you Shepherd and we're
[51:02] going to follow you where you lead we're
[51:05] gonna pasture we're gonna feed in the
[51:08] place that you lead us we're going to
[51:11] expect the blessing that we read about
[51:14] in Psalm 23 surely goodness and mercy
[51:17] will follow me all the days of my life
[51:20] why don't we just pray right now father
[51:23] I realize that my talking has been
[51:27] scattered a bit today but somehow I felt
[51:32] your pull in in different directions
[51:35] because I believe there are many
[51:37] different circumstances represented
[51:40] in those who are watching this program
[51:41] today and and I'm sitting here Lord for
[51:44] no other goal for no other motive but to
[51:48] help somebody to encourage somebody to
[51:51] give somebody hope that we're human and
[51:55] we're weak and we fail but you are God
[51:58] and you are strong and you never fail we
[52:03] make mistakes Lord and you never make a
[52:06] mistake we're really wrong sometime but
[52:10] you're always right and we just repent
[52:13] right now we call out in our homes
[52:16] wherever the broadcast is going right
[52:19] now for whoever feels the the calling of
[52:22] the Lord in your spirit right now we
[52:24] just repent
[52:25] yes we're children of God we're
[52:27] believers but we repent and we say we
[52:31] are sorry for the times that we called
[52:34] you Lord but we didn't let you be Lord
[52:36] for the times we called you Shepherd but
[52:39] we didn't follow you for the times that
[52:41] we called you strong but we we focused
[52:44] on our weakness instead of on your
[52:47] strength we just asked for your
[52:48] forgiveness right now and we just
[52:51] believe for redemption and Lord I'm
[52:54] believing right now for new beginnings
[52:57] in in in in old new beginnings in areas
[53:03] where there was a start a fresh start
[53:06] but it didn't last it wasn't sustained
[53:08] something happened I'm asking you right
[53:11] now Lord to restore what has been stolen
[53:15] away by the enemy I'm just believing God
[53:18] that that some of those watching this
[53:21] program right now will walk in the
[53:23] fulfillment of that promise that you
[53:26] gave in the scripture you will recover
[53:29] all Lord I ask you right now for
[53:33] somebody watching this program who has
[53:35] lost much but their faith has not
[53:39] wavered
[53:40] they've been discouraged but not to the
[53:43] point of giving up because like the
[53:45] disciples they knew there was nowhere
[53:48] else to go they knew there was nowhere
[53:51] else to run
[53:53] so they just kept running to you and
[53:55] even in those moments of discouragement
[53:57] they just kept running to you and you
[53:59] have sustained them all great loving God
[54:02] you have sustained them and so Lord I'm
[54:05] standing right now agreeing my faith
[54:08] with your faith the faith of the
[54:10] believer watching this program for your
[54:13] redemption for your restoration for your
[54:16] restitution and we just say to the enemy
[54:19] right now take your hands off of what
[54:22] God is releasing to the believers what
[54:26] God is releasing to those who not only
[54:28] know the word but they choose to obey
[54:32] the word Lord I'm thanking you right now
[54:35] for some solid houses for some houses
[54:38] and some lives and some families that
[54:41] have been built on a solid rock and the
[54:44] rain couldn't wash them away and the
[54:46] storms couldn't cause the house to crash
[54:49] and I'm praying Lord right now for
[54:52] somebody watching this program who built
[54:54] on the wrong foundation and their house
[54:57] crashed it fell flat and they're
[55:03] homeless maybe not in the natural but in
[55:07] the spiritual bankrupt homeless but I'm
[55:11] asking you right now Lord to give them
[55:14] another opportunity to build again
[55:16] hallelujah as long as there's time left
[55:19] there's lots of hope and I'm just
[55:21] believing that you have given me a
[55:24] divine appointment with somebody
[55:25] watching this program right now and that
[55:28] you are going to move as they surrender
[55:31] as they go back and say father I tried
[55:34] to build a house on what I knew but what
[55:37] I wouldn't practice what I knew but what
[55:39] I wouldn't obey and now I see it flat
[55:43] crumbled gone and I am asking you to
[55:45] come and help me build a house on the
[55:48] solid rock one that will never be flat
[55:52] Lord you're the healer and we ask you
[55:55] for healing for faith to rise up in
[55:58] those who are afflicted who are sick or
[56:01] diseased watching this program we bind
[56:04] the
[56:05] rid of infirmity in the name of the Lord
[56:08] Jesus Christ and we command you to take
[56:11] your hands off of God's people and we
[56:13] thank you Lord for sending the Holy
[56:15] Spirit of God to encourage every person
[56:19] watching this program today in the
[56:22] wonderful name of Yeshua the Lord Jesus
[56:24] Christ we pray amen and amen
[56:28] well I'm just very thankful that you
[56:31] were tuned in with us today and I so
[56:35] many different things have been said in
[56:37] so many situations spoken to that I'm
[56:39] just trusting that yours was spoken to
[56:43] that your need was somehow addressed and
[56:46] that you're going to face 2018 with a
[56:49] lot of hope because you serve a great
[56:52] big wonderful God if you've not been
[56:54] serving him now's the time call him Lord
