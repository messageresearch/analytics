Description:
"There is a people that show up in the end that flesh out, that give a body to the Word. Not the word they carry, the Word they are. You are a word, you are a word sent from God. Because a word is a thought expressed. Before you were ever formed in your mother’s belly you were in His thoughts and every page of your life was already written in his book."

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
because you're much older than the body you live in because Eternal God had thoughts about you you had them in eternity [Music] this getting into the presence of the Lord is to help us to understand he wants to have fellowship with us when we sow to the heavenlies when we worship into the heavenlies it creates a movement in the spirit that causes the heavenlies to Want to Break Forth Among Us [Music] because you and I need to understand that we are becoming the same with the word it's not just Jesus the word made flesh a prophet the word made flesh there is a people that show up in the end that I'm going to use my language that flesh out that give a body to the word not the word they carry the word they are you are preach for me you are a word you are a word sent from God because a word is a thought expressed before you were ever formed in your mother's belly you were in his thoughts and every page of your life was already written in his book so when you were a thought in his mind you were one with him and then you were expressed into the Earth and when a thought is expressed it's expressed as a word spoken you're here because you were spoken here a sex act brought a physical body for you to live in the biological systems that God put in place created for you a body to live in but that body is so little really it's so little in comparison to who you really are that's just where you live that's just your car you drive that's just transportation to get the real you where you need to go amen because you're much older than the body you live in because Eternal God had thoughts about you you had them in eternity had them outside of time so there is a part of you that is eternal the abiding is what you do and how do we abide we choose all the time to stay in him because the enemy Hallelujah because the enemy is all the time concocting ways to get you from him to get you distracted to get you burdened to get you worried to bring anxiety into your life and doubt and fear and who am I going to marry and will there be anybody left for me by the time I get old and all these things will I ever be able to pay my bills will it always be from from Payday to all this stuff the enemy wants to use anything and everything he can to pull you out of a of an abiding relationship with Jesus Christ where you are truly a branch living out of his life remember the Apostle said the life I now live is not my own that life died I'm living out of his life now
