Lord [Music] Hallelujah we give you praise Lord [Music] Hallelujah [Music] bless your name Lord bless your name any Wonderful Tonight let me read a scripture to you that the Lord dealt with me about today first Samuel chapter 10. beginning in verse 5 after that thou shall come to the hill of God where is the Garrison of the Philistines and it shall come to pass when thou art come thither to the city that thou shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a sultry where the tablet and a pipe and a harp before them and they shall prophesy and the spirit of the Lord will come upon them upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them and shall be turned into another man and let it be when these signs are come unto thee that thou do as occasions serve thee for God is with thee does somebody want to guess who that prophecy was to Saul this is when God was calling Saul to be king of Israel if you go on and read a few more verses it says he his heart was changed God gave him another heart when he encountered these singing Prophets isn't that strange and and so I just wanted to look up some of these words and we don't have time to do it tonight but I wanted to look up some of these words because we fall under criticism from time to time we're not paranoid but we fall under criticism sometime because we have drums and because we clap and because we dance and because we're loud all the things that you've observed already and uh we just all we know to do is what God called us to do and worship the way he called us to worship but I looked up that word tabrit it sometimes translated timbrel it's sometimes translated tambourine but as I searched out a little bit today it is a a hand drum it is a drum that was held in the hand and beaten with a small stick so sometimes it was just an animal skin so it was boom boom boom boom boom and other times there were there were tinkling sounds little little pieces of Glass and Metal that were around it like a tambourine and it made little tingling sound so I don't know which kind they had that day but it didn't disturb the spirit of the Lord it's not nearly as nervous as we are we are he doesn't need anti-anxiety medication calmer than a cucumber you can worship and you're not going to disturb him but you can stand there with a quiet voice and let your heart be in tune with him and you can be just as much in the spirit as anybody in the room so you don't judge anybody else's praise you just enter in and give him praise if when we leave here tonight brother Greeley and I just prayed in the office again and and this is what we agreed on if we leave here tonight and God has been glorified and his perfect will has been accomplished in this service we're going to go to bed happy men no matter what it looks like no matter what it looks like if he wants to call us all on our faces in Repentance I'm ready if he wants us to celebrate this is a feast of joy sakota is a feast of Joy if he wants us to celebrate we're already getting ready for that I just want him to have his way so don't you be distracted by anybody else's uh uh exuberant extravagant praise you connect with God how you can the best but just remember this praise is not about you [Music] it's not about me it's not about what we prefer it's about what God prefers and if you want to discover what God prefers what would you do you'd go to his word you just let God have his way and we'll be all right tonight [Applause] you unravel me with a melody you surround me with a song I have delivered from my enemy till all my fears are gone I'm no longer asleep to fear [Music] I am a child I'm no longer I am a child of God from my mother's womb chosen me [Music] I've been born again your family your blood flows through the

and a great time of loss and uh we have thoroughly enjoyed getting to have her we're reaping some of the benefit by getting to have her in church with us so often now and we're so thankful for that

exactly pull up to to the gas station and say praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus right I've had to before he always meets the need oh yeah you don't have time for my stories I've been at a gas station by necessity because the gas had run out and I'd Coast it in more than once with no money to pay and you're standing there trying to figure out what to do and somebody walk up and say I don't know you but God knows you I want to buy you a tank of gas and then you know the Lord he knew the tank was empty and he sent somebody I want to be that kind of a person that can hear his voice in a time like that so if you will prepare to give tonight we want to bless brother Greely we want to make sure that the expenses of this meeting are met and uh we want to give it as an offering to the

bring the word but we're anxious to hear from Sister Anita tonight may God bless her are you playing for her too aren't you Jonathan [Music] [Music] you know I thank the Lord for so many miracles and one of those is my mother you know she raised us along and uh there were five of us and the number six came along and Mom raised us and there are so many Supernatural things that happened brother Shelley that I saw with my natural eyes and I was in church where I saw demons cast out where I saw the people raised up that were not going to make it you know and last year about this time we were all in that season with Stephen and God raised him up and gave us six more months he answered our prayers and you know when brother um Dwayne Jackson was preaching the other day it hit me between the eyes because I'd always beat myself up because I wasn't with Stephen when he actually passed and I realized that I would have battled against God's will had I been there and I would have tried to resurrect him I would have because I saw it happen before you know so I know that the Lord it wasn't just the neatest prayers it was all of our prayers that God allowed us five more months with Stephen and then God gave him his harsh desire one of the things he said before he passed was I cannot wait to move My Arms Around Jesus and this song that we're going to sing and thank God that Jonathan is here to play it and Crystal's going to sing with me because you know it's still not easy to get up by myself without that sound that only Stephen Paul Curry could create but I am so grateful for that it lives on in his children it lives on in all of us the sound of the Bride so I pray that you'll just uh worship with us and the one that penned this song I'm like how in the world brother Shelley that they find my heart's desire how did they pin that the very thing like sister of Hope tonight she panned exactly how we feel and I thank God for the spoken word and I thank for the voice of Deliverance so worship with us tonight and if you know it sing it with me please [Music] at night I lay in bed and I begin to cry and my mind just fails to know exactly why [Music] here's a deep call to the Deep like a great magnify me it must be God here in my soul cause I feel the poor I [Music] hear the calls [Music] and I know his spirit s [Music] he speaks to me and I agree Lord

tonight in whatever way God wants to deliver it I want you to reach your hands toward our brother I want you to ask God to use him father we thank you for our precious brother we thank you Lord for how you've been using him and we are so delighted at the at the testimonies that have been coming of how you have moved and delivered and how you have pushed back the darkness and how your glorious light has broken forth tonight I ask You O Lord hide him hide him Lord behind the cross and let your word come out of him tonight to accomplish all that you would send it forth to do let him minister in whatever way you direct him with the gifts and we will glorify your name we will give you praise because you're worthy and the Saints said and then word of God speak let's receive brother Greeley tonight give us the word of the Lord word of God Speak would you pour down like rain washing my eyes to see your majesty to be still and know sure in this place please let me stay and rest in your holiness word of God speaks word of God's speech would you pour down my grace washing my eyes to see your majesty to be still and know you're in this place please let me stay and rest in your Holiness word of God speaks we don't have the words to say tonight how happy we are to have you in the house of the Lord we are thankful for those of you who have joined us our precious Brethren from Indiana have driven all day and I guess brother you've come the farthest now we have a brother here from Iceland but brother Chris flew in today from Israel he was there on a tour with his dad and some other brothers and he had a desire to change his ticket and come to camp meeting we're all admitting that it would be hard for us to make that decision so we've got a lot of confidence in you that God's going to meet you while you're here there's got to be a reason for it and we're happy that all of you are here all the visitors sing it one last time as brother Greeley comes word of God speaks [Music] washing my eyes [Music] [Applause] [Music] in your Holiness word of God [Music] we indeed desire for you to do that tonight Lord that the word of God would speak into our lives and do for us what we cannot do for ourselves we yield to you now we ask you to hide us behind the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ God you guide this service exactly the way you desire for it to go let your name be glorified in all that is said and done for it is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we pray amen if you have your Bibles with you tonight like to start in Revelation chapter 19. what an honor it is for you to be in the house of the Lord with us several weeks back brother Shelley came to me and he said I would like for you to preach Sunday and Tuesday and somehow God had other plans or maybe he already knew God's plans and he just wasn't letting it all out at one time Revelation chapter 19 starting in let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God and I fell at his feet to worship Him and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy now I want to point something out before we move on because whoever this was that John fell down before he said get up he fell down to worship Him but he said don't do it I am just one of the fellow servants and you know what that tells me it was somebody had attained the character of Jesus Christ to the point that John fell down to worship Him all right I would like to read Revelation chapter 10. verse 8 through 11. I know that camp meeting a couple of years ago this was the theme but just go with me if you will Revelation chapter 10 verse 8 and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and kings in other words it cannot stay on the inside there is something that happens on the inside that when the word become it goes down sweet as honey but then it starts to work around in there and all of the sudden it's got to come up and out and that is the Mandate of the Bride of Jesus Christ in the end time that we are to prophesy again to many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings the Lord bless you you may have your seat tonight may the Lord bless the reading of his word when no when this scripture when it begins to have an effect in US it starts doing something seen to us because we realize that God is doing something in a many-membered bride that is it's no more a one-man Ministry it is something that God wants to uh go out and be in a many membered people because there are many people that have not yet heard of the truths of the Living God and he would like for us to be those Messengers who will carry the truth of God's word into the Earth in the end time in order to do that it is necessary for us to eat the book [Music] it is necessary for us to eat the word of God and in order for us to have something to say it is more than a Sunday school lesson it has to be a word in due season because when it's a word in due season then it will hit its Target with much more uh Gusto will say it'll end with much more Dynamics than if we just are all the time popping off at the mouth just because we have something to say but the the the Holy Spirit desires for us to be living vessels of the Lord Jesus Christ so the the the the tenth verse of Revelation chapter 9 I fell at his feet to worship Him He said see you do it not I'm a fellow servant of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy now the in order for the spirit of Prophecy to take its effect in us there and and for us to start looking uh like Jesus Christ there has to be the word as I said in due season and we have to hear it with Spirit ears and so I'm going to call on you to do that tonight because I feel like that I have something to say and I'm not going to say everything right it's impossible and I'm going to leave some things veiled because I want you to tune your ear to the frequency of the Holy Spirit and let him speak to you as we are transitioning now for what God wants to do in the rest of this weekend now we know that God has a five-fold Ministry that he placed in the earth in the end time Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11. let's just read it if you have it handy there Austin he gave some apostles some Prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ now this five-fold ministry Apostles prophets evangelists teachers and pastors this five-fold ministry was given into the Earth because God chose that to to perfect the Saints the word that would come up out of their mouth now you we don't want anybody to become offended but sometimes we would say uh if you want to get closer to the fire come closer to the front now that is not to lift up a man that may be leading worshiper preaching the gospel but let's just think about what a man of God who stands behind this desk he has been in the presence of the law Lord to seek out a message of truth that we would be able to deliver to the people in the due season and so that way would stand to reason if you've been out working all day and you've been around all kinds of things and he has been by himself in the presence of the Lord trying to get a word from the Lord then there is should be more of the fire of God up around here and it should be in order for him to be able to deliver the word now God gave some Apostles he placed these gifts in men and and he took profits and he's still using prophets in this day and he has pastors who are under the unction of the Holy Ghost to lead a congregation and we have been told in this day that a pastor is the highest Authority in a local uh church and then we have the evangelists and we are told that they come through and they give these fiery message messages and sometimes they cause a little trouble by what they stir up and they leave town and leave it for the pastor to take care of and then we have teachers because sometimes it takes a necessity for a person a man to slow down and not be so out of breath so that you can understand and catch what is trying to be taught now I am not ashamed tonight to stand before you and tell you that I believe that God sent a word prophet in our day his name was William Branham I say a word Prophet because I believe that the word testified or prophesied rather that he would be here in the earth in the end time I find that in Malachi chapter 4 you may say well that was John the Baptist well John the Baptist was also prophesied and in order for you to get the whole picture you have to read the rest of the book and you can go to Luke chapter 1 and you can find that John the Baptist only fulfilled a part of that commission he turned the hearts of the fathers to the children and then the messenger in our day turned the hearts of the children back to the fathers now in order for us to really get a grasp of that and and receive the word that come out of his mouth there has to be a belief that God indeed did send that Prophet now I'm not dwelling on that tonight what I want to dwell on is that God still has Apostles prophets pastors evangelists teachers that five-fold Ministry is still in the Earth today and I would like to focus on the prophetic tonight because I believe that God is about to shift this meeting and it is necessary for us to have ears to hear what the spirit would say unto the church all right Deuteronomy 29 29 the secret things belong to the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong to us now God gave prophets to reveal the word of God now lest you should get nervous I want you to understand any prophecy any prophetic word any word that I preach it must come back and it must dovetail with this the absolute that God has given to us if it doesn't dovetail with this then we need to either throw it out or lay it aside that's good my recommendation is don't throw it away just yet unless you can for sure prove it is not in the word because there are things that we have said with our mouth I can't find that in the scripture I don't understand that and then in later time God comes along and he reveals that it's there it just took some time for our understanding to get to a place where he could speak to us all right so that that the things which are revealed belong to us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law now I want to tell you that God gives word prophets again he gives prophets that are according to the fivefold ministry such as agabus into acts 21 10 who had more than the gift of Prophecy likes Philip's daughters who were in the previous verses Philip's daughters were they had the gift of Prophecy but they were not prophets seers as agabus was now Amos 3 7 says surely the Lord God will do nothing but he Reveals His secret unto his servants the prophets Amos carried the prophetic anointing that God used to speak to his people to bring them into alignment with their papa who had brought them out of Egypt and that's what the prophetic voice does it is to bring us back into alignment with God for the moment of time that we live in and so he wants to he God desires to speak to us not just with good preaching or with Evangelistic preaching or just a pastor kind of preaching but he wants to speak to us in a prophetic voice a prophetic utterance that will help us to get above this world that we live in yeah now I believe that there are good preachers all over the Earth they're called of God there are good pastors there are good evangelists there are good uh teachers these are moving about but a prophet and Apostle have a different calling and we need to be aware when they're around us that we don't dismiss their voice that it's just another preacher and Amos he came to the people in in Amos chapter 5 and and he acknowledged to the people that God had acknowledged them and through this utterance of Amos he acknowledged that the children of Israel had indeed carried the Tabernacle of God through the wilderness that was God's plan he said I want you to have tents we're in the Feast of Tabernacles we built this we built this uh sukkah out here because the scripture tells us that all of Israel are to build sukkas to remember year by year that at one time God's people dwelt in booths or Intense or in Tabernacles they dwelt in a movable structure I don't know how movable that one is as it is but nonetheless a movable structure it was not the permanent structure neither was the tabernacle where that they went to offer sacrifices and where the there was the the Ark of the Covenant the holy of holies it was there but every time that God said it's time to move yeah every time that the pillar of fire moved there were no excuses I'm tired today I'm sick today I don't feel like moving that thing today ah just uh we just moved it last week why do we have to do it again there were no excuses because Moses knew when that Pillar of Fire that Shekinah of God when it moved it was time to move there was no way that they could stay put they had to move and so now Amos is right here and he is he is coming to the people and he is saying to them God wants you to know that he saw every time that you moved that Tabernacle but God also wants you to know that he saw every time you put those Idols of yours in your back pocket as you were carrying the ark and the Tabernacle and going to the next site I want you to know says the Lord that I saw that you were doing what I said to do but really your heart wasn't in it you were only doing it because you didn't want in trouble with Moses or maybe you didn't want me to have to send another brass serpent among you but uh I notice that you weren't really having a heart of worship as you move my stuff around in the wilderness because you were still carrying all of your Idols with you as you went from place to place now I don't know what was in the minds of the people but we can watch people in general and Evan you you can watch people that they say they believe God but they generally have a backup plan if things don't work out the way they thought it ought to work out if I get sick and I go get prayed for and I don't get healed I got a good doctor [Music] nothing wrong with doctors not at all but there's a way that we approach God [Music] if God don't work I got a backup plan [Music] but God sent Amos among the people to let them know that they were still in this situation where they were they they still were willing to move the Tabernacle but they weren't going without their own Idols because they felt like that they needed a backup plan so I want you to go with me to the Book of Amos chapter 7. Amos chapter 7. verse 7. then he showed me and behold the Lord stood upon a wall made by a Plumb line with a Plumb line in his hand everybody know what a Plumb line is is a heavy weight on a string that is hung in order for something to be built according to that line now I want you to remember something that we have been told through the years any Brick Mason can lay a straight line now don't mean to take issue with that but I've seen a lot of what was supposed to be straight line brickwork that was not real straight Eddie Mason can lay astray a straight line but it takes a real Mason to turn a corner and at this corner when this Plumb line is dropped and there this I don't think they do it a whole lot with brickwork anymore but nonetheless when this Plumb line is dropped it is to designate a straight line because the weight is holding that string taut it's holding it straight now when we talk about a Plumb line in the word of God generally this Plumb line is something for us to measure up to and many times we find ourself in a crooked position and when we find ourselves in this crooked position we have a choice when the Plumb line drops we can remain in our crooked position or we can allow the word of God to come inside of us as we talked about a minute ago and let it start working on the inside and all of the sudden then we start straightening up because we've recognized that God has sent a Plumb line word that we've got to measure up to and so in order for that Plumb line word to to have an effect in US it takes belief on our part if God sends someone Among Us whether it be a pastor a teacher an evangelist and a prophet an apostle it is necessary even someone with a gift of Prophecy it is necessary for us to connect to that word and say I believe that word or we have the other way we can say I don't have anything to do with that say well who would say that there are many people through the years that have done exactly that it may have never been words out of their mouth but all you had to do was watch through time as something happened things were happening in their life and where they were crooked and they denied the plum line word they got crookeder and crookeder and crookeder and crooked or if that's a word more crooked more crooked more crooked all right so the Plumb line is in the midst of My People Israel I will not again pass by them anymore and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste and I will rise against the house of jeroboam with a sword then amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to jeroboam king of Israel saying Amos has conspired against thee in the midst of the House of Israel the land is not able to Bear all his words for thus Amos saith jeroboam shall die by The Sword in Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their land I want you to pay attention to what is written here also amaziah said unto Amos oh thou Seer go flee thou away into the land of Judah and bury bread and prophesy there but prophesy not anymore at Bethel for it is the King's Chapel and it is the King's Court then Amos answered and said to amaziah I was no Prophet neither was I a prophet's son but I was a Herdman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit and the Lord took me as I followed the flock and the Lord said unto me go prophesy unto My People Israel now therefore or hear the word of the Lord thou sayest prophesy not against Israel and drop not Thy word against the house of Israel therefore thus saith the Lord thy wife shall be in harlot in the city thy sons and thy daughters shall fall By The Sword and thy land shall be divided by line you'll die in a polluted land and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land now Amos very plainly tells amaziah I was not a prophet I wasn't even the son of a prophet but God sent me to prophesy now Amos this prophecy in Amos chapter 7 this prophecy was against jeroboam the jeroboam was the king at present of the divided House of Israel amaziah the priest didn't like the prophecy that was given we could see that there now during the reign of Solomon David's son during his reign he had a gentleman by the name of jeroboam who had been promoted to be ruler over all of the charge of Joseph Solomon put him in that position now jeroboam must have been upset with Solomon over Milo Solomon was building up all of these places around Jerusalem that had maybe gone into disrepair but jeroboam took uh he he was upset because all of this labor was on the backs of the people and Solomon didn't seem to care all he cared about was making everything beautiful for oh I mean he built the the temple for for the Lord but then as he began to take on these uh these women that were outside of Israel these women foreign women and he began to have all of these lovers that his attention was diverted from the god of Israel and the Bible says that he started going after their gods and and apparently he was making beautiful houses and homes for all of these women but he was doing all this labor on the backs of the Israelite and jeroboam took issue with that and he started voicing his opinion started voicing his opinion and as he voiced his opinion he knew he was going to have to flee the country before he fled the country there was a prophet that came and met him beside of the wall and says to him jeroboam had on a new coat and this Prophet came up to him and ripped his coat off and hacked it into 12 pieces representing the 12 tribes of Israel and as this code is being ripped off of him and this Prophet is prophesying the prophet tells him you are going to lead the house of Israel jeroboam flees goes to Egypt Solomon dies I know this is a little slow but I want you to get this story Solomon dies and his son rehabil him now is the king over all of the nation of Israel all 12 tribes jeroboam gets word that Solomon has died the man that was after him because he voiced his opinion the man that was after him was dead rehabo him is now the king and he decides that he's going to come back into the Kingdom of Israel and he's going to have a little chat with real boy so he gathered some of the men of Israel and he goes and he starts talking to rehaboom and he says rehobo him you know your father was really hard on the people of Israel and do you realize rehoboam that if you you kind to these people they would do anything for you why don't you let up a little bit from what your father was doing rehoboam says give me three days and come back so jeroboam goes away rehoboam goes to some counselors the first counselors that he went to told him or the the first counselors he went to were of the Elder generation the older folks the old men the old man told him you ought to listen to jeroboam there's good that there's good wisdom in what he said rehoboam said thank you very much and then he went to the young men the men that he grew up with those that he had been around all of his life frolicked with probably went to the bar with and did this with and did that with and he those young men said you know what you really ought to tell them my little finger is going to be bigger than my father's loin in other words don't let up don't let up so rehoboam decided to take the counsel of the young men and when he took the counsel of the young men he came back to jeroboam and the house of Israel and he said listen to me he said my father chastised you with whips I'm going to chastise you with scorpions I'm not going to let up on you I'm not gonna let up at all now because that rehoboam took the counsel of the younger man prophecy was fulfilled because of that happening the way rehoboam responded to the house of Israel the kingdom was ripped away from him now we've got to remember that it had been said years before that God was going to do it in fact I believe that he had told Solomon but he said I'm not going to do it to you I'm going to wait till it's your son now I'm going to let you go and and you're going to wrestle your fathers but it's going to happen to your son so now the these these uh these people are raising up in a rebellion against rehoboam and the prophecy to jeroboam by the prophet ahija is come to pass and the ten tribes are now under the leadership of jeroboam and jeroboam listen now I want you to hear me jeroboam is now their leader but jeroboam is one of those that doesn't really care whether he's following all of The Commandments of God jeroboam was in the northern kingdom and jeroboam as he is into leadership to his ten tribes as the prophecy said he would be he now offers to the people a substitution he began to tell the people it's too much trouble for you to go down to Jerusalem because now remember the word of the Lord through Moses to the people of Israel was that they were to leave their homes no matter where it was in the nation of Israel and three times a year they were to go to Jerusalem to celebrate the feasts of the Lord not Jewish feasts the feasts of the Lord so three times a year these men would make this pilgrimage down to Jerusalem according to the word of the Lord but now jeroboam is in the place of authority and he doesn't want all of his people to go down there with the Holy Rollers jeroboam he says I you know it's just not convenient for you to go down there so I'm going to set up a temples in Dan and in Bethel and I'm going to make it so that it's a little bit easier for you to go and to Worship the Lord I'm going to make it a little bit more palatable for you uh I'm gonna make it a little bit more palatable than them screaming shouting tongue-speaking Acts 2 38 screaming youngins she don't want any of those whooping crying screaming amen and Hallelujah where did God say worship he said go to Jerusalem now I realize that rehoboam was under another spirit but it did not change the fact that God said I want you to go to Jerusalem to worship but jeroboam said I want to make it a little bit more palatable for you I want to make it a little bit easier for you you know you really don't have to have a new birth you really don't have to do all that crying you don't have to do all that speaking in tongues is it really necessary to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ well if you want the Holy Ghost that's what it says it says that if you repent and you're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and now you say well what about Matthew 28 19 well that's the name the name of the father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ that's his name so when you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you got the father you got the son you got the Holy Ghost and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now I want you to know that baptism doesn't save you no baptism doesn't save you it doesn't even wash away your sins it is an outward sign that you have walked in obedience to the word of God and that you have repented of your sins and that you're really desirous to go with a further walk with God than just saying Lord I believe you so all of these people now they have places of substitution to go worship now through the years we have seen as churches have declined in their way of worship that they have uh changed their way of how they got church membership and it became a substitution as it did in Dan and Bethel because people were no longer willing to pay the price to go to Jerusalem just as people are no longer willing to pay the price for the new birth so they shake a preacher's hand or they confess an Apostles Creed or some Creed of some church somewhere rather than sticking with the word of God or they carry a certain book or they say they believe a prophet and they you know they they get this idea that if you believe a certain man you have the Holy Ghost but that doesn't work that is a substitution that is a Dan or a Bethel [Applause] now here is what I like would like to say those of you that don't understand our language just hold still we'll go somewhere a minute if we really believe a prophetic message and the spirit of Prophecy is at work in our lives wouldn't it stand to reason that we would obey what that prophecy said because the prophet that God sent in our time told us that this new birth would produce a change in our life and he said it would bring deliverances in our life and that it would bring shouting and that it would bring speaking in tongues and that it would bring rhythms in the spirit and when we get in the rhythm of the spirit and we don't try to rush things then God can do stuff that we don't even see now what is important for us to remember when all of the emotional stuff dissipates yeah it does you're not going to live on that high every day all day long your physical body could not handle it I'm here to tell you your physical body could not handle it that being said we're getting closer and closer as we take on more and more of the spirit of God that the molecules of this body are speeding up God and my theophany body is slowing down and one day there's just going to be a meeting in the middle and I'm going to join that new body so I want to get in his presence every time that I can I want that spirit of God to fall on me in such a way until that it is fire shut up in my bones that I don't know what to do with and I want it to take me higher and higher in the spirit of the Lord but when all of the emotion part has settled down come on I have to have word to stand on I have to because when Peter and the disciples were asked who do men say that I the son of man am [Music] I well they said some say you're Elias and some say you're John the Baptists and some say you're this Prophet or you're this one Jesus says but who do you say that I the son of man am Peter answered Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus responded to Peter and said Flesh and Blood did not reveal that to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it now Jesus did not say that the gates or that that the gates of hell would not try oh he didn't say there wouldn't be War and that is why we here preach the importance of spirit and Truth amen because if all you do is ride around all week long on spirit the gates of hell are going to Prevail against that they're going to war against you that was an emotion that was just an emotion that was just an emotion but if you after you settle down a little bit don't settle down too much preacher needs you after you settle down some and you walk out that back door and all that that good high height of emotion kind of leaves you and the next day you face demon spirits you're not going to be able to point them back to the emotion you got to point them back to the word [Music] you gotta Point them back to the word because upon that rock the rock of Revelation the Lord Jesus Christ that's what the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against and when the enemy comes and he will come now you may feel like he comes like a flood but all when the spirit of the Lord comes and he rescues us he comes with a flood and his flood is bigger than the devil's flood now if you don't mind I'm going to take just another moment to be real political we have heard through the years that all of this is not necessary the spirit the emotions whatever you want to call it all the speaking in tongues all the gifts of the Spirit they're not really necessary we've got the word and they point us back to a quote of William Branham where he said how can I teach the people algebra when they won't learn their ABCs well I would like to inform somebody that I think I got the ABCs [Laughter] and I think it's about time we learn some algebra is that all right matter of fact I believe hear anyhow God has been gracious to be teaching us some algebra because the proper balance now once again everything has to come back and dovetail to the word of God because everything else is shifting sand God gave us this word the absolute for us to stand upon and I cannot begin to explain to you or figure out it has to be Supernatural how that this book this book is only so big and it is baffling to think that for hundreds of years preacher after preacher after preacher has taken this same book and it has continued to cause people to come and sit in situations like We Are Tonight to sit under the sound of the word because they realize that something is going to be revealed that is going to give us rapturing faith God is revealing the word piece by piece by piece to us because it is his desire to give us the rapturing faith that we need to make an exit out of here there's going to be some things that we're going to watch happen in the end time as we get closer to that day and we're gonna we're gonna start having appearances of those that were uh that are awakened up out of the ground before that we take our flight out of here we're going to have some reunion along the way maybe 30 to 40 days before the bride takes Rapture out of here just as it was when Jesus was on the earth and people started making appearances in Jerusalem people that had been dead for quite some time looking for it to happen friends now I'm trying to preach to you about prophecy now according to amos's prophecy the sword of the Lord would come to the house of jeroboam now I am Messiah the priest of Bethel he was a priest of false worship remember that and Messiah was a priest of false worship and he sends to jeroboam the king of Israel and he says Amos has conspired against you now this is what prophetic does because when it gets out of our comfort zone it starts stirring up the devils you didn't catch it that was a warning hear the spirit when the prophetic starts flowing it stirs up the devils now Amos prophesied to amaziah and he said he's just prophesies and amaziah hears it and he's a false priest and he doesn't want his little church Disturbed and so he sends to jeroboam and he says jeroboam Amos has conspired against you the house of Israel for thus says Amos jeroboam is going to die by the sword well that's kind of what it looked like but that ain't what he said the prophecy said the sword would come to the house of jeroboam now amaziah the false priest the priests of false worship is now stirring up trouble demons are now stirred up and amaziah comes to Amos and he says get out of my church foreign I think you just need to go down to Jerusalem down to Judah with that bunch of Holy Rollers because you're starting to act like them and we don't want you around here I don't want you to prophesy in my church ever again now I have felt Amos I have had those same words spoken to me in a church I have allowed the Lord to let all that fall behind me can't let it stop me because I realize when the prophetic starts moving it starts moving demon spirits so amaziah says I don't want you to prophesy in my church anymore so now we find that in First Kings 14 jeroboam has a son that is on the brink of death and jeroboam tells his wife you feign yourself and you go to the prophet and find out whether our son is going to live jeroboam his wife comes back she's found out she can't hide from the prophet and she comes back and says no our son's going to die his the son dies and the Bible tells us that shortly thereafter jeroboam dies there is no wording that he was slain that he was taken out by a sword it just says that he died now we can also find in second Chronicles chapter 13 where that the the leadership in Judah has changed to abijah abijah is now the leader in Judah and jeroboam is still the leader in Israel but the Bible says that God smote jeroboam doesn't say that somebody smote him with the sword it says that God smote him he did not recover the Lord struck him and he died now everybody stands back and says Amos is a false prophet Amos is a false prophet he's a false prophet why did they say Amos was a false prophet now you got to remember that demon Spirits are stirred up they've been stirred up and when demon Spirits get stirred up that Spirit of Leviathan starts twisting things and by the time that it goes from The Prophet's words to our ears the enemy is trying to bring curvature to it he's trying to pull it away from the Plumb line Revelation he is trying to pull it away from the Plumb line and he's trying to put his own twist on it because he is still trying to build a kingdom close yet when Satan was kicked out of heaven he did not quit trying to build a kingdom will try in tonight and when Amos prophesied he said the sword is coming to jeroboam's house amaziah starts passing along that Amos is after jeroboam that wasn't the word at all Amos had really nothing to do it except to deliver the word of the Lord so now jeroboam Falls dead he expires there is no sword to take off his head he was not slain but the Bible says he did not recover and he died and there was another one that came that Amos was declared a false prophet and not until jeroboam died and his son Zechariah took his place then the sword came against the house of jeroboam Zechariah was slain by shalom and the word of the Lord by Amos was fulfilled against the house of jeroboam [Music] do not allow the enemy to cause you to throw away the word of the Lord because that you are trying to put your own interpretation on the word of the Lord when Zechariah jeroboam's son was slain jeroboam's dynasty was done it went to another Dynasty went to another house God was finished with him so now we see by the scripture that there was a prophecy that went forth and people misinterpreted it there were demon Spirits stirred up that caused the word to be misconstrued to be falsified to even kick people out of church because they didn't want him around any longer it was all of that kind of stuff that gets stirred up foreign case you haven't figured it out this is a prophetic Church and Demon Spirits get stirred up frequently be mindful that the devil as a roaring lion is constantly going around seeking whom he may devour trying to find someone who has tried to live off only emotion and never got rooted in the word so when the emotion is gone all they have is nothing but a twisted idea that they have formulated because the enemy has got it now friends this is not a new idea this started way way way way way way way back in the Garden of Eden because when he got kicked out of heaven into the Earth he was looking for something to get in and he's still looking for something to get in today he's looking for a mind he's looking for a mind that he can corrupt he's looking for a mind that he can defile he's looking for some way that he can distort the word of God that's all he did in the Garden of Eden he distorted the word she said God told us that we weren't supposed to partake of that tree surely not surely not just a distortion just a distortion and that's what what the enemy is trying to do to you and to me and to anybody else he is trying to do it to any human being in the Earth because if he can distort the word and prolong any season he will attempt to do it Amos get out of my church I don't want you here don't want your prophecy now I would just like to briefly touch on Abraham because this is another instance of how the enemy tries to deflect the word of God from coming to us in its power I remind you that Amos was a human being every Prophet that has ever been on the Earth has been a human being just as our Apostles just as our pastors as our evangelists as our teachers a human being Abraham was called by God God said Abraham I want you to get up and get out of this land get up and get out of this land and at that time his name was Abram you know and his wife Sarai but he told him get out of this land Abraham obeyed him but in Genesis 12 it tells us that there were some things in the earth that were transpiring and Abraham went down to Egypt when Abraham when Abram went down to Egypt he knew that Pharaoh was going to want his wife because she was beautiful and he told Sarai he said all you got to do is tell him you're my sister I'm your brother so now we can either call it a lie a half lie untruth part truth can call it what you want but it conveyed to pharaoh that she was available and she wasn't she was a married woman carrying a promise but Abraham didn't want to be killed you know and so God came and he let plagues come upon Pharaoh's house and she was let go now I just ask you a simple question who did the deceiving sir I played along but Abraham was the one that you know hold on to that Genesis chapter 20. after their names had been changed El Shaddai had come and breathed into them the Breath of Life they go down to gurar now folks Abraham it's near a hundred Sarah was near 90. but she was that Breath of God that was breathed into her did something Supernatural for her because when they went into gorar once again Abraham tells his wife is going to want you and I want you to just tell him you know you would think he'd learn you tried to Sly once but he didn't want to die he knew that a Bible that could kill him so he told her just say you're my sister so she indeed does that and this time God Appears to abimelech in a dream and says buddy you are as good as dead if you don't restore this woman to her husband well he starts throwing up his hands in surrender and says wait a minute wait just a minute I wasn't the one that did the deceiving out of the Integrity of my heart I took her they said that was his sister wait just a minute did God change his mind about Abraham because that abimelech starts offering him excuses as to why that he's taken Sarah not at all but what did God do he says I want you to restore that man's wife to him and you let him pray for you because he is my wait a minute wait a minute profit you're telling me that man lied and he's God's prophet wait just a minute I would like to inform you tonight that no matter your opinion of what Abraham did either time the calling of God was upon him he was a human being from day one but the calling of God upon his life was put there by a supernatural means Abraham did not go to the hardware store and buy it the Bible tells us that gifts and callings of God are without repentance but I sure do thank God for every man of God every one of a woman of God who keeps their lives in a state of repentance so that they can utter the word of God and we don't have to wonder today if there's still dollopin out here and some sin somewhere seen plenty of them they came in with an air about them and they had a genuine gift I'm not taken away from the gift at all we have seen marvelous gifts work Among Us but after some time the man started showing through the gift never left him kept on prophesying kept on seeing in the spirit gift never left him but his life did not reflect amen the Lord Jesus Christ now I want you not to worry about Abraham because God got him back in line and he will get every servant of the Lord back in line if they will live in a state of repentance and our bridal inheritance part of it is that it doesn't take three days to repent no come on that's right now it may take some time on that initial when we first get saved and we got a lot to unload it may be but after we've been serving the lord for a while it is not our desire to mess up and when we mess up all we have to do is simply come back to God and say Lord I messed up because I'm just enough Baptist to believe that when I got saved once God didn't come to take it away and I couldn't mess up bad enough to take it away because the blood of Jesus Christ is still on the throne and My Sacrifice tonight is still good enough more than good enough it is perfect and all I have to have to obtain mercy and say papa I messed up again would you please forgive me now I think I said last night that doesn't give us license to just uh live a life of sin and say oh I repented and go back and do the same besetting sins over and over again no way the desire of a real True Believer is to get that stuff out of our life and when God reveals it to come to Papa and say I gotta be rid of that I yield to you I find myself saying that more and more to the Lord Lord I yield to you tired of saying no I did that enough of my life saying no God don't you know that the fool has said in his heart no God it's really what it says there is is italicized you can read it that way that's fine it's the way the King James reads but really the fool says no God no I lived a lot of my life that way and I found out it's a whole lot better for me and a whole lot easier for me to receive Revelation from the Lord if I just keep saying yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord so we recognize through the scripture James 5 17 in the Amplified says Elijah was a human being Elijah was a prophet Elijah was a human being with a nature such as we have with feelings affections and a constitution like ours and he prayed earnestly for it not to Reign and no rain fell on the earth for three years and six months Elijah was a prophet called by God to speak the word of the Lord over the land of Israel and the Bible says he prayed earnestly for it not to Reign and no rain fell but it also tells us that Elijah was a human being he had a nature like we have he probably got mad he probably uh you know he was just flawed that's all there is to it he had Hang-Ups he had faults probably had family issues just as any other human being but the fact remains that the calling of God was upon his life I hope you're listening to me the call of God was upon his life now you remember I'm going to call the musicians and I want you to come but do it quietly as as we have gone through all of this tonight I've tried to make sure that you understand that every emotion that we have we're just human beings and we express ourselves differently and sometimes there are emotions that we don't understand and groanings in the spirit that we don't understand when we pray for people as I said the other night we allow the spirit of the Lord to pray over you in tongues because we don't want our opinion to get mixed up in what Deliverance you need because there are uh let's just say it again we're human every servant of God whether it be man or woman that would pray over you that may or may not know you they're human and they can watch people and they can see the attributes of a human being and they can start speaking over you in prayer and it could not be what you need at all right but if he the spirit of truth will come and will yield to him and let him do the praying through our mouth we're just his mouthpieces we'll let him pray through us over you and it can bypass our intellect bypass our opinion and let the Holy Spirit do in you what we can't do for you you can't even do for yourself but the Holy Spirit can do it for you if you will just simply yield I can't yield for you but Shelley can't yield for you your mama can't yield for you brother Daniel can't you nobody can yield for you you have to yield your own self foreign to you saying can I believe the word that I'm hearing can I believe the word that I'm hearing now this preacher told me that if I will repent and if I'll be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he told me that I could receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost now he pointed out to me that that is in the book of Acts in chapter 2 verse 38 I can see it in the word so now it is my responsibility to connect my faith with the word that I have heard I believe it I see it in the word I'm told by the preachers that I can stand on the word I'm told that the word says Heaven and Earth will pass away but the word of God abides forever and so I'm going to stand on that word if I need the baptism of the Holy Ghost I have something to stand on [Music] will it come with emotion oh it probably will sometime or another what it'll look like I have no idea what it'll look like for you I could try to tell you what it looked like for me it's not necessary tonight you can watch me sometimes it's still have an effect the Holy Ghost is still have an effect I still I I still let him come and get a hold of me and do what he wants to do but now I would like to finish up with a scripture found in Matthew chapter 10. because I believe that this is very important as we are going in we are we are transisting now into the rest of this camp meeting I believe God is going to do something profound Supernatural I believe he's going to do something Supernatural tonight I'm not putting it off I believe that he's already been doing Supernatural things but I I really want us to understand the significance of hearing the prophetic word of God hearing a word in due season and not only hearing it but how we hear it how we receive it uh Matthew chapter 10 and verse 40. receiveth you receiveth me this is Jesus speaking and he's letting the disciples know that if people receive them carrying his message that they are in essence receiving him and he that receiveth me [Music] receiveth him that sent me he is helping them to recognize that he is the embodiment of the father dwelling in a body on the earth the Bible said that he was the fullness of the godhead bodily in a body he was on the Earth but he is carrying out a a mandate from Papa and he says when they receive you they're receiving me and when they receive me they're going above and beyond me they're going all the way back to the Ancient of Days they're going back to Creator they're going back to Papa and they're receiving him verse 41 he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward now I'm going to get plain here and change the wording and you'll have to figure out the rest of the story he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a pastor will not receive a prophet's reward I know that's strong meat but I want you to listen to me he that receiveth a prophet in the name of an evangelist will not receive a prophet's reward he that receiveth the prophet in the name of a teacher will not report why is that because you're not really putting the proper calling on the servant of the Lord [Music] you're lessening the gifting that is in them and so you are not receiving the full cup of blessing that would come if you would receive a prophet in the name of a prophet then you get the prophet's reward he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward now this can go to any calling that we place in there I believe because if a man comes here and he's placed as a pastor and you receive him only as another preacher you don't get the full reward of the calling that's in his life but if you will allow the spirit of God to just work inside of you and say Lord I may not understand fully the calling on this one or that one or the other one I may not understand the calling that is on the that certain preacher's life I may not understand it but I'm asking you to help me to understand it so that I can get the full benefit of the gift that he carries so that I don't miss anything that God has for me beautiful because when a when a prophet comes Among Us to deliver the word of the Lord if we will we can step up another notch amen and I am one who wants to go up another notch because I believe that there's more for the Bride of Jesus Christ to have in this end time than there ever has been before I believe that there are things that are coming to us that that we may not have heard in past times and and I just was reading today uh something that had been said here some years ago that we may see some things that do not look like past revivals they may not look like what we've seen in history but God is Not confined to history but it does all have to come back and line up right here in the Plumb line you may not be able to give me chapter and verse with it but it has to have its Essence right here in this book it has to lay right in the pages of this and God has sent not future tense God has sent I believe a Plumb line word that every other word has to measure up against I believe that God sent it to us and that we have a responsibility to say Lord I receive what you have for me I receive that you would speak into me everything that the Holy Spirit would come and speak to us in this house I want to tell you that I am so grateful to you for the pool that you have had for the word of God in these last four Services I appreciate it so very much but I want to tell you tonight hear the spirit things are about to shift about to shift let's stand to our feet tonight and I want Benjamin to lead us in some worship but before he does I want us to just sing a course of that song that reverberated through a past Revival and I want you if you're willing I want you to sing Lord I believe and Lord I receive D could you give us a quart of that please Lord Lord

receive and we're going to sing it one more time and I want you to lift your hands not half-heartedly I want you to say Lord I agree with the word of the Lord and I am setting my heart and mind for this shift that is coming that is about to transpire because I don't want to miss one single thing that you're going to say to this church Lord I receive for Lord I receive D all things are possible through Lord I received oh Lord I receive [Music] Lord I received all things are possible Lord I receive now Lord as we stand here with our hands in the air signifying that we surrender to your will and plan and we receive the word of the Lord that has been spoken tonight that you have a voice that you want us to hear and God it originates in the heavenlies and that you chose a mouthpiece to speak that to us and we're just entering into that right now in the name of Jesus Christ I decree over this congregation those that are pulling those that are pressing in those that agree with what you're speaking and I decree over them that they will hear the word of the Lord and that we will not miss anything that the spirit of the Lord would say unto the church in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ God all glory belongs to you all praise belongs to you and we are entering in now once again to praise you for the word of the Lord that we have heard tonight last night in previous days and
