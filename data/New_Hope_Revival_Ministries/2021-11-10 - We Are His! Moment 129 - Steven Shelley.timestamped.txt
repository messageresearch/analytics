[0:00] there is going to be a praise for my god
[0:03] i want that praise to come from me
[0:07] i'm not going to wait for you to praise
[0:09] him i'm going to praise him
[0:12] i'm going to worship him
[0:13] because i love him
[0:16] and he loves me
[0:19] and he's told me that i am his
[0:23] i am his
[0:25] what more do you need
[0:27] to know that i'm his
[0:29] i don't need anything more you could
[0:31] close the book up and put everything
[0:33] else aside but i know that he told me
[0:36] you're mine
[0:38] you're mine
[0:40] and i'll do anything and i have done
[0:43] everything
[0:44] to bring you back to me
[0:46] because that's where i want you
[0:49] he wants you
[0:50] right by his side
[0:53] he he offers to you in the scripture he
[0:55] says
[0:55] take my yoke
[0:57] upon you
[0:59] okay a yoke
[1:01] com it joins two people or two animals
[1:04] in the in the scripture now
[1:06] he would never have offered to you
[1:09] jesus would never have offered to you to
[1:12] take a portion of his yoke upon you
[1:16] if you were not equally
[1:18] yoked with him because he knew the
[1:20] scripture that you're not supposed to be
[1:22] unequally yoked
[1:24] so he's not going to stand there and
[1:26] offer you to stand by his side
[1:29] and join that yoke with him unless
[1:32] you're equal with him
[1:34] the only way you're going to be equal
[1:36] with him is that you have to have him
[1:38] living inside of you he has imparted a
[1:41] part of himself to you so you have the
[1:44] right to stand by his oh glory to god to
[1:47] stand by his side
[1:50] i know
[1:51] that i am his
[1:53] i know he invited he invited moses to
[1:56] stand in the cliff
[1:58] he said come come here moses
[2:01] stand by my side
[2:03] on this rock
[2:06] he didn't tell moses to get away from
[2:08] him
[2:08] he invited moses to stand beside him
[2:12] he made a place for him in the cleft of
[2:14] the rock he's made his place for you in
[2:17] the cleft of the rock
[2:18] and he has invited you he says come
[2:21] stand beside my side stand right here oh
[2:24] my why would you want to go anywhere
[2:26] else whenever you have an opportunity to
[2:27] stand beside jesus
[2:30] because whenever you know that you're
[2:31] beside him all your worries are gone
[2:34] all your problems have been taken care
[2:36] of
[2:38] i can't get over the fact just the three
[2:41] simple words
[2:42] we are his
[2:44] if you can ever get that revelation that
[2:47] if you can ever grasp a hold of that
[2:49] that he has made claim to you
[2:51] and if he's made claim to you he will
[2:52] not lose you
[2:54] he will not lose you
