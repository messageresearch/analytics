Title:    That in All Things He Might Have Preeminence — Part 1
Speaker:  Ife O
Church:   New Hope Revival Ministries

========================================

Description:
"And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell." Colossians 1:18–19

This message focuses on giving Christ complete preeminence (first place) in all areas of life. Pastor explains that while God gave us emotions to serve us, they shouldn't control us - instead, the regenerated spirit infused with Christ should lead from the inside out, ruling over mind, will, and emotions. He emphasizes that believers must look away from negative things (anger, jealousy, envy, sorrow) to look toward Christ.

Using Colossians 1, he explains how Christ contains the fullness of God and should have first place in the church. The message stresses that this isn't about taking away from other spiritual authorities but about properly positioning Christ as supreme. He also discusses how sorrow and grief are natural, but shouldn't trap believers in a cycle of expected behaviors or prevent them from living in Christ's victory.

in prayer on Wednesday of this week is the anniversary of of of the Resurrection Life spoken over a little fish uh on a lake one time where God was demonstrating his power uh the Resurrection Life the voice of Resurrection in the bride I like to think about that because that's exactly how it's going to be the bridegroom through the bride will call for the resurrection just a little fishy that time what's it going to be when the dead in Christ shall rise first when you think you've taken all you can stand and then we come together in one Crescendo of God's glory and power and declare even so come quickly Lord Jesus and he comes darting across the sky to pick up those that are his his feet won't touch the ground uh that time but he's coming for his bride I'm one of those you don't have to believe in a Rapture you don't even have to make plans to go if you don't want to but I plan to go I'm not particularly looking for a way out of tribulation and sorrow I'm having that now but I'm looking for Relief one of these days the old song that that Cade sings and I've never been this homesick before uh I'm looking for deliverance one day the final Deliverance I have a friend on Thursday brother Eric who serves God in France and uh we're we're friends I appreciate him he has been under great attack his family under attack and he has a birthday this week would you just remember my friend brother Eric to the Lord that God would strengthen him and give him boldness total freedom and help and hope it comes from the Lord we share a great love for the message of the hour we were blessed a couple of years ago when we were up preaching for brother Danny Adams to meet his mom and dad his mom is very sick now uh maybe about perhaps to make her Crossing and uh it was a pleasure to get to meet her so I saw his birthday on the calendar and used it already as an opportunity to pray for him uh it's a lonely place to be in in France a very liberal place to be God help them and strengthen them would you stand again uh you're a little quiet that's okay I pray that you are meditating on the things of the Lord God has something good for us um if you keep up with the spirit today God has something good for us amen Colossians chapter 1 uh we are so thankful for his minute by minute grace as we mentioned just a moment ago thank you for continuing to pray for the family of our sister who has left us that God would continue to strengthen them and lift them up and give them a great hedge of protection from all the the darts the fiery darts of the enemy uh that old Spirit of antichrist is still around presenting another Jesus and that Spirit comes against us when we don't even realize the source of the attack the mystery of iniquity death already work one of the biggest lies on the planet today is the Roman Catholic lie it's a lie it's deceiving the masses it gets in folk like a seed and it doesn't want want to turn them loose but we were singing today about a fountain running toward us a Fountain of Grace aren't you thankful for a Fountain of Grace God sent it to us to supply our every need Colossians 1 beginning in verse one 1: one Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God and Timothy our brother to the Saints and faith faithful brethren in Christ which are at colos Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ we give thanks to God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ praying always for you this language was hard for a faesy he certainly struggled to Express in words just how this miracle had taken place that God had sent his son remember that it was not a common understanding in the time of the Lord Jesus that Messiah would be both Lord and God and Paul wasn't looking for God he was looking for a deliverer what he found was a god who came down to deliver a and he got a little wordy sometime trying to express this relationship uh between Father and Son since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which you have to all the saints for the Hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the Gospel gospel the good news which is come unto you a as it is in all the world and bringeth forth fruit as it doth also in you since the day you heard it the gospel is a fruit bearing reality once it's in you brother it cannot help but produce itself and that's the fruits of the good news since the day you heard of it and knew the grace of God in truth what a paradigm shift had just taken place across that region as she also learned of epais our dear fellow servant who is for you a faithful minister of Christ who also declared unto us your love in the spirit for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding you want to pray for one another pray that pray that your brother may be

joyfulness giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints when when it says he has made us meet it's like in Hebrew help meet it means he has measured us up he has watch this before your SE he has measured us up to be partakers we were short we came up short we came up lacking but what we could not accomplish in our own will he measured us up that we might be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light may God that is blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated who hath delivered us now now watch these words carefully from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son when when future sounds to me like it's a present reality it's already happened if you are saved by grace Washed by by the blood of the Lamb you have already been delivered from the power of Darkness the only Power that it has over you is what you yield to it and he hath already we're already seated together we're already by faith translated transformed transfigured into the kingdom of his dear son my my these are rich words and don't give up we're not there yet in whom we have Redemption through his blood even come on now even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image Jesus Jesus Yeshua who is the image the IM not the negative the image of the invisible God the first born of what for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and for him this is the mystery of God revealed there it is it's beautiful beautiful words of Life Hallelujah and he is before all things and by him all things consist of him it doesn't say by him all things exist it says all things consist it means he is an ingredient in all things praise God in your heartache he's an ingredient uh you might call him the main ingredient you might call him first on the label you understand when you're reading a label it just really aggravates you when you find out that you've paid way amounts of money and the first ingredient is water you see they list the ingredients according to the amount I'm never happy when the first ingredient is water something else of value's got to be in there for it to cost that much so when uh when it's listed on the be it means that that in this product is these ingredients they they are constituents they are ingredients and he is uh uh thank God he is an ingredient in everything that we face in life all things were created by Him and for him th this is really really good let's go on and he is the head of the body the body being the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that means there'll be others that in that in all things he might have the preeminence in all things that he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell This Modern Church world they're so afraid of offending the father by putting too much emphasis on Jesus that's exactly what the eternal spirit would have you to do because it was in Jesus in Yeshua that all the fullness of of God dwelt and that pleased the eternal spirit it pleased the logos he was pleased that he was able to deposit all that he was into a body because this was his original design not for one son thank you for helping me but many sons and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven so the ultimate reconciliation of all things is through Jesus Christ Our Lord and you that were sometimes alienated this is Gentiles this is goem uh this is the Nations you who were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind God didn't call you an eny you considered yourself an enemy it was a work of your own mind by Wicked Works yet now even you hath he reconciled hath he brought in isn't that good in the body of his flesh it had to be this way through death that you might be presented holy unblamable unreprovable in his sight you you there's no rebuke because he had has measured you up uh I I I know we're reading but let me go ahead and finish now if you continue in the faith grounded now don't miss the word continue because it's part of of John 15 Paradigm that you must continue to abide in him you can't cut yourself off from your life source and expect to thrive he's the Vine we're the branches and he said you know if you abide in me and my words abide in you you've got Authority then to ask and what you ask I'm going to give it to you you cut yourself off from the from the vine and then you ask well that that that's not a given promise but if you continue to stay in him and allow his word to to stay in you then you've got the authority to ask what you will I like that continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven whereof I Paul am made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his his body sake which is the church I've been so blessed Paul said that I'm going to have to catch up a little bit on the hardships I sing that sometime ly wolf wrote if it if it keeps getting better and better if you if he keeps on pouring it on if it gets better than this Lord I don't know what I'm going to do and Paul said I was in that place and then I was reminded that I'm one who is to also bear in my body the sufferings come on it's part of the Fellowship of the mystery it's given unto me for you to fulfill the word of God God's word must be fulfilled even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from Generations but now oh no generation could say that like this generation but now what has been hidden from ages and generations now is made manifest come on to his Saints we're getting somewhere to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery singular not Mysteries mystery if you're looking for a singular mystery to tie in with this you'll find it in Revelation 10:7 when the mystery well here here is part of the mystery it is simple it's Christ why don't we say in me it's Christ in me the hope of glory Christ in me the hope of glory that is the mystery that was to be finished at the sounding of the seventh angel messenger it was to be known that you were in Christ from the the foundation of the world so that in the last age of your life you would manifest who you are and I am who I am because of because of who he is Christ in you the hope of glory he goes on to say whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect somebody said nobody's perfect but Jesus that's not what the word said you are perfect in when we're not in him we ain't much come on we have no hope the only Perfection that we can know is shared Perfection it's by holding on to him don't ever turn him loose don't ever turn him loose let him have the preeminence in every part of your life let him be the one let him be the priority let him be the one you look to let everything else decrease that he might increase don't focus on righteousness focus on him if you focus on him you have imparted righteousness you have imparted forgiveness you have imparted Grace excuse me you have imparted Perfection whom we preach warning every man per uh that that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus next verse where unto I also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me this is that key here that everything God has required of you he has provided for you in Christ oh my oh my that means you don't have to pay for it the debt is paid the debt is settled don't get in the rat race of Works don't let the enemy confuse you into thinking that if you sin which I I I'm hoping that you won't stumble in unbelief but if you do please know that his gracious Grace has provided atonement for past present and future unrighteousness it's covered if you believe that say Amen all right I want you to wake up in here just a little bit uh some of you are napping nap later you can have all the nap you want this afternoon but not in here anybody with me are you getting a little yeah I'm getting a little feisty you're on my time now I don't know if you know who Adam Clark was but he was a um a commentator a well-respected commentator and when he was writing about this preeminence he said that he might Jesus that he might be considered in consequence of his mediatorial office as possessing the first place in and being chief over all the creation of God he's higher than the highest greater than the greatest he is equal to the most high therefore he is also most high in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed paragraph 507 brother brandom is just quoting in 506 this verse that we just read in Colossians so we go to 50:7 he is the head of the church which is his body and he wants I hope you don't find that selfish he wants the [Music] after all it's Christ in you the hope of glory don't try to make church about you don't try to make church about brother brandham don't try to make church about your pastor church is about him never about us it's always about him he must have the preeminence Among Us in every situation and in order for that to happen we have to turn away from something else and look away unto Jesus there's always going to be something negative there's always going to be something dark there's always going to be something painful there's always going to be something stressful we're living in an hour now where where children will tell you I'm stressed I I want to ring their Bell when they're less than 10 and they say I'm stressed I it it's such a by word there's always going to be stresses and that's not because you don't have your favorite cereal we're talking about real stuff you can do without uh Fruity Pebbles come on now that's not stress but we're going to have stress and we have to choose to look away from it there's always going to be hateful words we have to choose to look away from it and look to him where does life come from him looking to him looking away to him he is he is the head of the church and he wants the pinenes listen now listen close he said he is to be the head of the body his bride's body the bride Church body which is taken from him flesh and Bone like in Adam see bride God reached in and separated from Adam the feminist part of how he was created and made a woman made a bride the same way we were in Christ before the foundation of the world sir and God reached in through the truth delivered us pulled us out it was an exodus you might say so that we could then manifest who we are and who we are depends on who our husband is you've got to stay married to Christ you have to abide in him to ever become Ms Jesus Christ right all right he said born from the dead that's born from the dead the sin of unbelief he said what killed Eve because remember she wasn't ever going to die unbel belie watch the wording here he said their unbelief in what by uh the the the unbelief of in God no he said she had faith in God she believed that God existed she had had fellowship with him she she she wasn't an Infidel she knew that that God was real she she didn't say there's no God no sir she wasn't an Infidel well well she said you know I don't believe his word at all no she didn't say I don't believe his word she believed all but one little thing that was all it took to throw the whole thing out of cater God knew what he was doing come on the human race sold out over one little piece of unbelief just one little tiny thing there that is what costs so much in the message the presence of God unrecognized he said that's what we need a washing of unbelief out on the bank let you read it for me let the word of God have preeminence it's idle it's necessary not the cloud the word these are dressings these are additional things that God has done for us signs are uh to help these Gentiles believe without signs Gentiles have a problem believing so God lets us have these things we can't cling to signs we must let the word have our preeminence our Attention our full Focus he said that's what we need interesting here 64 that's what we need a Revival and wash all the unbelief out and all the bugs you think there's any creepy bugs that need to be washed out sometime and superstitions sir you think we ought to be cleansed over and over and over again from our superstitions oh yes we need a Revival for that and things he said come out and see that God is still God is still God that's what we have revivals for to to prove that God is still God and that he must have the preeminence now now that word preeminence is a Greek word 4409 it actually comes from a derivative of 4409 4413 and it means to have the first place if Christ has the preeminence it means that he's number one to be in the first position to hold the first rank with the the implications of high rank and prominence or highest dignity to be the first to have super Superior status to be chief that he might come to have first place in families in your work situation in your trials in in in your strains and stresses he must have the first position he must be Chief if you won't let him be Lord of all he's not interested in being Lord at all he doesn't want half your heart maybe you think that's pickiness but he doesn't want half of you he doesn't want part of you he wants all of you he can't do much with half a head with half a body no no he needs a single-minded man a double-minded man Lord have mercy this is a product of the greatest battle ever fought I've never lived in such an hour where I've seen so many double-minded people I'm bumping into them every day and remember that doesn't necessarily mean mentally unstable it it sort of does but in another in more spiritual way it it it means declaring the faithfulness of God one minute and fear the next next and that's a challenge because fear is present and it it is certainly lurking in our life but we have to choose every time over and over again and again and again faith and not fear what if listen if you're if you're saying what if you've already opened up a door for fear what if I'm going to talk I am yes I'm here mhm what if should have could have would have well I'm going to say this I say it a lot I'm going say it again well if he'd have just had a better doctor doctor killed him if he had just had better medication if he'd had just been in another hospital come on if we could have just found it earlier all the things that we say as a double-minded man right the the reality of God's word is he is Sovereign you can be sitting at the Mao Clinic with the best doctor with the best medicine with the best treatment and if God's coming to get you you're going that's just sovereignty that's just what the word said and if that is let me let me see your hand if you believe that's right I'm not I I mean I don't want to I don't want to scrutinize you but does anybody else believe am I the only one that believes that it's not the medicine it's not the doctor thank God for them I'm not against any of that uh I'm not against uh hospitals I'm so glad that're they're there when we need them if we need them I hope I never need them again but I'm glad to know it's there if I need it brother you get sick and somebody said don't go there they'll kill you there you hear all kinds of things but but let me see again how many of you believe that it's it's it's not that it's if God's calling you you're going you believe that you sure you believe that you are you sure because if that's the case then you cannot spend another day of your life I should have exactly right preaching to you I should have I could have I wished I had have wished I a call wished I'd have went wished I would have done this wished I would have done that wished I would have done the other don't you understand that God at any time can stop the cycle of whatever is happening in our life haven't you heard the story of the uh of The Reluctant uh person who was to uh knock on doors and invite people to church and and didn't want to do it but agreed to do it reluctantly agreed to do it and goes and knocks on the door nobody comes knocks again nobody comes hear some scurrying around skirting around and wondering what's going on he said would knock one more time and here comes somebody to the door he said I'm I'm here to invite you to church the person said it's too late for me too late for me church I'm too late for church I'm too far gone for church opens the door and comes in sitting in the middle of the floor there he invites the man in sitting there in the middle of the floor is a stool hanging from the rafter of the hallway is a noose the person's been on the stool just about to get the Rope tight and the knock comes on the door he leads that individual to God let me tell you something God is Sovereign he knows how to send somebody it's like the little lady I love that you I'm not going to tell it again but you'll get the punchline it's like the little lady that said wo yes sir God did provide the groceries and he made the devil pay for them God will use your neighbor God will use somebody yes sir if he needs to put something to an end he knows how to do it so you cannot embrace the full sovereignty of God and spend another minute I don't care how many rocks are being hurled your way how many arrows are being thrown at you how many vicious satanic lies are being cast your way you can't live another moment in that kind of place that's what pulls people to the edge you must not be double-minded you must let Jesus have preeminence in every situation look to him he's got it he's got it let him wash the unbeliever in the message the token he tells us here and I am looking for a time of a Break Forth of the spirit of God in these last days that we're now living in for another surge of the Holy Spirit into the church it's like an inoculation it's like an infusion a surging of Holy Spirit spirit Power into the bride church for a rapturing faith I know that they're preaching that this is come and gone it's passed but it's like scripture you can't you can't ignore the comma you can't drop the the phrase off the end and think you've got the whole understanding when does that serve of Holy Spirit come into the church with rapturing faith just before it comes that's right brother so to say that's already happened and we're living in the surge just before it comes and everything is sitting straight in order for that that's the thing you can rejoice in God's word is restored faith has been restored somebody's winning the the greatest battle ever fought are there people in this room losing that battle Yeah for now come on you know it's a it's not just a a a war is made up a lot of battles you don't win every battle but you're going to win the war if you abide in him and his word abides in you so you win some mind battles and you lose some mind battles at times and then they come back around and this time you win it's just a it's just an e and a flow and an inward struggle to overcome in all things but you will if you persevere you will if you push you will if you strive Godly strive not carnal strive Godly striving pushing through I want you to know there's somebody in this room right now that's winning the greatest battle ever fought somebody sitting here this morning is winning it and here's how they're winning it because they're letting Jesus have the preeminence [Music] you break out of the expectation that you think somebody else has for you that's I don't mind grief grief is the processing of heart heartache and heartbreak and I don't mind that but what I despise is to see somebody caught up in a Geral wheel of expectation well I can't laugh at that I'm grieving well I can't eat that you know I can't eat chocolate cake you need some you don't know what you're missing you know I can't wear a red tie on that's not normal I can't turn the lights on you can't sure you can you're caught up in trying to figure out what somebody else is expecting of you that's not right that's not of God grief is of god it's a part of an emotion that is given to us to help us process life but don't you get in that well I can't go to a birthday party come on now why do you live in the Dark Ages you're going to wear black for a year I don't care if you grieve it's okay but you but look if if you wake up and want to wear purple we're not living in Victorian days sir it's the expectation of a society that's going to hell in a hand basket you really care what they think about how you grieve hallu well I can't have a Thanksgiving come on now I can't have a thanks yes you can because you've gotten so much look folks this is the example that's being lived before you it's not the preacher it's what we see demonstrated to us every time we come to the house of God when somebody brings a praise not because everything is all right but if he has the preeminence why the Bible tells us when we fast we shouldn't have a long face we should wash our face and anoint our head with oil and go about our life as though we were eating Sumptuous meals so that no one knows what's going on don't let your right hand know what your left hand's doing you're fasting unto God not people people quit trimming shaving quit brushing their teeth while they're fasting no shower no deal no Mom anybody old enough to know what mum is Megan does I guess that's Megan over there it's a brand it used to be a brand of deodor and antiperspirant kind like a cream I'm fasting I oh by all means because when you're fasting all those toxins start coming out of your body I don't particularly need to smell them I can't I can't comb my hair I'm fasting come on folks that means you just want somebody to know what you're doing that's not the way we do this the Lord Jesus must have preeminence in all things you just keep him you just do what I saw today I saw people who are hurting praising I saw people who've got problems praising I see people who are under attack praising why because somebody here is winning the greatest battle ever fought minute by minute by minute by minute [Applause] not because we're superheroes or above humans but because we found the key the answer is in the word that he might have preeminence in all things excuse me excuse me pardon me praise God I better not smile somebody will think I don't feel it not not feeling the depth of the oh my goodness don't let it somebody else judge where you are just put Jesus up there let me tell you something there's so much I want to tell you but I better move on here he said I I believe every everything sitting straight in order for that the token and I believe that we now we are now at the time that the word yes should have preeminence not stories the word the word the word the word the absolute it's the anchor that's what holds us and he said and I I believe that the time to lay aside our Creeds and our thoughts that time is here and and and we've got to do what come back this is 11 2863 seals are loosed word restored and we're still people still living in Creeds and in their thoughts there are people around this truth that have traded denominational Creeds manmade denominational Creeds for for man-made message Creeds so that brother brandham can have the pre or this is not where we are we are in an hour where we can now put the word and Christ as the center of all things we are not making addendums to the word we're we're not making footnotes we're not adding to it don't add to the word or take away from the word if you make a prophet say something that doesn't line up with the word you make him a false prophet brother brandom said to brother green if I let that church age book stand as it is it would make me anti- word it says things in there that I can't find in the word that's what he said should we burn it no he said we'll corrected in the next Edition we should never assume not even prophetic people we should never assume that there'll be a next Edition there are things that must be corrected now yes or there will be a group of people still holding on to new Creeds and man-made thoughts instead of coming back to the absolute of the word every time you say something like that people are just sure you're trying to take away remember a moment ago you're not taking away from the father when you say that in the Sun the fullness of the godhead dwelt bodily you're not taking away from the message of the hour or from the prophet brother brandom when you say that Jesus should be the preeminent one Among Us you're not pulling him down so that you can lift Jesus up you're just lifting Jesus up and everybody else has to find their right ful position by the way the ground is level the brandom said there's no big guys around here he said we're all just brothers sir there's no great big brothers and little bitty Brothers we're just all Brothers don't you start looking at man as a big man no sir he's a little man that serves a big God Jesus have the preeminence is that all right well we got to move move on same uh uh back to Christ is a mystery of God revealed beginning in paragraph 371 this is powerful powerful words here he said no the fullness of godhead is made known The Secret of mystery is now revealed that God is manifested God and man become one the anointed man Christ you see those who were beginning in the 50s and 60s to understand the true deity of Jesus Christ they still believe that he was 50% man and 50% God the Assemblies of God the Church of God the major Mainline Pentecostal denominations of the 50s and 60s were teaching their Ministry that he was God man but that he would have been 50% man and 50% God I I I think that's dangerous to try to figure out which is which brother brandom said no he's 100% God and 100% man and he could draw on his Humanity when he needed to he slept God don't have to sleep neither Slumbers nor sleeps but man did 100% man slept but then the storm Rose oh ye of little faith he wakes up the disciples about to panic about to about to go into anxiety attack all ye of little faith and he gets up and speaks to the wind and the wave puts his foot on the bow of the boat and says peace be still that wasn't man he was drawing on the deity then that was 100% God that said peace be still it matters because we have a pattern son Jesus hello Jesus was the pattern son somebody said well when they made him they broke the mold no no no no no God made him and recorded the mold because there must be many sons not many jesuses many sons all of creation granth travaileth for the manifestation of sons of God who rise up with some creative Authority you know it's it's it's not really more power it's authority to do with the power that we have because Jesus said you'll be in endued with power ter in Jerusalem you'll be endued with power behold I give you power over all the powers of the enemy you you can't have more power than all the power if you're a true disciple of Jesus Christ filled with the Holy Spirit washed and Sanctified by the word you've already been given the full endowment of power but you don't know what to do with it because it's only through sunship it's only through full adoption that we begin to understand the authority that's given to us as Sons to answer with the word instead of our emotion the enemy is asking a bunch of questions and if you answer with your emotion sir he's going to tie you up and Tangle you up in your own thoughts but if you answer with the word he doesn't know what to do with you right I don't mean just dry quoting scripture I mean let that Living Word rise up in you and talk to him and then he says Whoa here's somebody here's a son that knows what to do with the power as long as the church doesn't know what to do with the power it's like a wasted commodity but when sunship becomes our understanding by Revelation then we know who we are because of whose we are and we begin to have confidence in the god who's living inside of us and we begin to understand that the mystery was always to be always to be Christ in you amen glory the hope of glory somebody said well if everybody knows that it's not a mystery everybody doesn't know it most people say it but they don't know it it's different it's not just having some little small deposit of a spirit in you and now I'm I'm I it's Christ in me no no no what house will you build me I'm not looking for a tent anymore I'm not looking for a tabernacle anymore I'm not looking for a for a wood and and Stone Temple anymore I'm looking for a tripartate man I'm looking for one who will yield himself Body Soul and Spirit to become an anointed man and an anointed woman and I want you to know that while you are tossing in the sea of Life somebody in the house is winning the battle yes sir you must not be jealous you must Rejoice for them and follow their examp example know the fullness of God that it is made known The Secret of mystery now revealed that God is Manifest God and man become one are you still here the anointed man Christ what does Christ mean the anointed one the anointed that was anointed with the fullness of the godhead bodily oh my how can people do that doubt that remember he had it without measure the only way you and I have it without measure is to come together sir putting the pillar of fire back together it appeared as clothing tongues of fire sat on all of their heads everyone receiving a deposit of the fullness of the godhead that's what Holy Ghost is but in order for us to have full measure we got to come together that's why it's unifying time that's why it's uniting time that's why the bride is coming together maybe not all geographically but she's coming together under a revelation yes sir so we're putting the fire back together Hallelujah and then what does the church have Christ in you sir the hope of glory isn't God good all right let's go on uh uh the anointed that was anointed with the fullness of godhead B how can people doubt it where once partly Moses had him partly David had him oh my but here he is manifested in the fullness deity himself in the beginning was a word the word was with God the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth that's the the fullness of God it pleased the father don't you ever forget that it didn't disappoint the father for Jesus to have preeminence it didn't disappoint John the Baptist for Jesus to increase while he was decreasing you want to carry that a little further in your mind let's go on God in fullness to die for the sin of the people that he might bring to his church what I hope everyone's hearing this there's quite a few people out missing from the sanctuary right now I hope you're hearing this because you need this to bring to his church a Sanctified life that he might have the preeminence in full in his church to manifest every promise in these last days that he promised for the last days see he said listen now are you now just pinch yourself a little now watch come on pinch yourself what was Jesus manifested for to show God he was God he had to be no man could die no Prophet could die he was God he was the god of the prophets he was the prophets he was the Kings he was the history he was he he was he that was to come he that was he that is he that's to be in this day the same yesterday today and forever he was manifested for that purpose praise His name praise His name and through that purpose he achieved a church that he the fullness of God might bring to P oh my goodness come on every promised every promised word of God in these last days he gets yes sir you know my spell check doesn't like brother bram's pluralization of preeminence it keeps wanting to correct it I refuse to let it because I get it you see I have to give him the preeminence and you have to give him the preeminence and you have to give him pre and you have to make him Lord of Lord and give him preeminence and then in this church this Universal bride church he has the he gets the preeminence his preeminence in the church the position his place you know th this is what sunship and adoption is about it's about position Pentecost understood the filling but they didn't understand the positioning they didn't understand what full adoption looks like that releases The Authority when a son is properly placed when a son is properly positioned you can't be properly placed or positioned if you're floating on a bed of ease cushions cushions and rose petals don't position Suns battles blood bullets sweat spit trenches that's what positions places Sons I need something a spray or something for my throat please that's what places and positions Sons it's battle it's a battlefield brother this is not a picnic hello we don't get to choose our our class this is God sees us amen thank you so much I me just try I've got to Jesus said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also even more than this shall he do for I go to my father see that was his purpose there was the manifestation and now today he wants to get somebody that can so see it the first step is you got to see it that they can let the word that's yield to it you've got to see it first then you've got to yield to it let the word he said see Jesus so seen it so was so perfectly born for the day until God expressed every move that he made he Jesus was God's revelation God revealed last paragraph now he Sanctified with his spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed now that's every promise now this little bride has some promises that have not yet been fulfilled maybe even revealed there are some pieces I I the hardest thing for a minister is to be burning with a subject and unable to preach it but I'm burning I I spent about 10 hours yesterday studying or something that I I can't even preach this morning but it's a key for where to place some things that have been misplaced if you put everything behind us and that's what they've done now I I I I just marvel can I just will you indulge me just a minute I just marvel when I hear them preaching uh we know what the Thunders are I Marvel because it must be so holy and so precious they can't tell any of us cuz you you may get by some saying you know them but you're not going to get by everybody because there's some of us that are going to want to know well what did they say he said they weren't even written he placed them over and over again he backed off that just slightly toward the end but he placed them over and over again on the back side died he he he made a just a little adjustment toward the end of that of that thought I think I know even why if we knew we could be out of here but it's a promise it'll take those it'll take them the bride has never had a Revival yet third seal it'll take that well then when you come along and tell us we know what it is then I'm going to need to see the proof of the spoken word Revival that is to follow because when that Revival comes it comes with creative power I'm looking for the full I'm not looking for a dozen testimonies to settle a whole mystery I'm looking for an army to rise up and to properly place the word and watch this thing produce Christ and then take us out of here are you with me if I hear a prophet say I do not know what it was I do not know what it is we don't know it was not permitted for us to know we have the revelation of the six but I do not know I could not make it out then I have to believe that there are yet promises that have not yet been revealed fully and fulfilled in the bride body he says at the end of the seventh seal it's not time for it yet I I'm hanging on to yet when it comes it'll come like a Roman Candle it'll come you say who hey here we are but if you keep putting things behind this has happened this has happened this has happened this has happened there's nothing to reach for then you're going to have to start explaining why uh that this bride church is becoming sicker instead of more well amen and nobody's going to want to face the reality of that it's simply because we won't have the fullness of that until we win this mind battle I need you to know there's somebody here that's winning the battle and you know what that means it means you can too if one does that's right God loves him more no come on now God loves her more no no sir he doesn't love any of us more than the rest of us that's right but we have to apply what we already have what we already know before we can reach in faith for what we have not yet seen manifested among that's all I want to say on that subject but he is one of these Glorious Days going to put one foot on land and sea no doubt about it he Sanctified with his spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed now see he could go back and pick up what these other fellows have left off here he's talking about the reformers of the other Church ages in the last days and by his and by his holy spirit revealed all the mystery of the seven seals he's putting them all in this subject Seven Seals that's what he's doing see he is expressing himself that's his purpose that's why he died that's the second fold of his three-fold manifestation now watch this first to express hisself in Christ then Express himself through the church and then establish the kingdom he doesn't get to the third one in this paragraph Christ was the word he said first to express himself in Christ then Express himself through the church and the same thing Christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word it's not how much of the word you go through it's how much of God's word goes through you you read it all day long hear it preached all day long and if you start putting that on other people and disqualifying yourself you'll never be changed you're going to have to raise up we're going to have to raise up in every moment and say that's mine that's mine that's our Christ not Christ in you only Christ in me the hope of glory if he's going to be the hope of glory in anybody he's going to be the hope of glory in me you you personalize This Promise one more thing and then we're going to we're going to shift into something that I think is going to bless you Christ is a mystery of God one more I'm skipping 388 and 380 I want to go to one 154 so we get all three things to take home with us first to express itself completely God in Christ that is the the mystery Christ is the mystery of God revealed first to express your completely God in Christ second to have the pinenes by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them that is US Christ is the mystery of God revealed the bride church is the mystery of Christ revealed now how can you say something like that because he said all that the father was so I have no problem saying Christ is the mystery of God revealed the bride church is the mystery of Christ revealed now let's get that settled and and go home not to 888 let's go back to our Heavenly home let's get out of here I'm ready I'm anybody ready to go I no no need to hang around if we can get this thing right and then thirdly to restore the kingdom somebody said what what kingdom which kingdom what does the Kingdom look like well let's go all the way back to the Garden of Eden first and then all the way back to the beginning before the Garden of Eden we'll get a glimpse of the Kingdom we'll understand through the words of our Lord Jesus what the kingdom is to be it's not to be a geographical place it's to be an established throne in the heart of his people this is where his kingdom is we are his subjects he must have preeminence in us he must have have dominion we must give him lordship over our lives Amen in every area holy spirit says don't do that don't do it but but I did it last year and it didn't bother me it's different now it's different now it's different now the holy spirit is cleaning he's sanctifying he's doing doing something in us thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talked with them fellowshipped underneath the shadow Gia I can't stop my wings when you're singing something like that my wings just want to go because that's where I want to live I told the Lord as she was singing I want to live there I like it so much there it's so much better there I want to live there under the shadow oh well he's light and there is no Shadow you you must understand we're getting under him meaning he has preeminence if you're under him then you're in his shadow hello Peter understood the concept such as I have Christ in me the hope of glory such as I have now in in in in closing this service and shifting here just a moment for something interesting if Christ is going to have the preeminence the first place the main attraction in our lives there are going to be some things we have to look away from in order to look away to Jesus we're going to have to look away from some other stuff one of them is God has given us emotions to serve us not to control us I want you to hear me now to serve us our emotions help us us to make contact with the world around us and with what we experience in life and they are to follow our lead it's from the spirit man that we live our life and that is a regenerated Spirit that's no longer Fallen Spirit like Adam ended up with this one now has been infused with the life of Jesus Christ it's a reg generated spirit it's resurrected with the Life of Christ the life that I now live is not my own do you follow me and that Spirit man that Jesus in my spirit that life of God Zoe in my spirit is is to Lead Me outwardly from inwardly outwardly so it should have dominion over my mind my regenerated Spirit now infused with the holy spirit of God should have iion over my my soul life my mind life the soul is mind will and emotions so Christ in my spirit regenerated new spirit Christ in there he should rule out my over my mind over my will reigning over my emotions my emotions are what help connect me to my physical physical body and the physical body is not my enemy it's my house that's all it's not the real me it's more in the negative than in the positive but it's needy it's necessary and it's where some of my trouble comes from so I've got to have the Holy Spirit ruling and reigning from inside outside and my emotions have to obey what Christ is saying on the control tower of my life if I'm living any other kind of life I'm not living the ascended Christ life I'm living a part of carnality a part of Earth life and spirit life and that's not how God wants his people in the last day so we we're working we're working toward giving Jesus Christ on the throne of our heart full dominion over every area of our life that he makes choices and we yield to them and he's not going to choose death for us he's going to choose life for us he's not going to choose disease he's going to choose health and healing and wholeness are you with me so if we're going to make Christ number one that means we have to make some other things bow and being led by anger anger has to Bow being led by jealousy and Envy that's got to Bow and another point that we're facing is sorrow if we're looking away to Jesus then sorrow has to it has to Bow because we we don't grieve as those who have no hope we grieve as those whose hope is I've got more hope for that than I do this that's Eternal amen RJ had an an amazing dream this week and I asked him this morning would he read it would he share it with you and I think that you're going to be really blessed because to get to where we're going like brother Joe was preaching to us kicking off the camp meeting to get to where we're going we have to pick up what we've dropped and in order to pick up what we've dropped we've got to get past anything that's keeping us from running on with the vision correct you follow that and I think this dream is a key would you come brother and I I didn't know how we should share it he he wrote it amazing but I'm just giving him Liberty I'm going over there to sit and I'm just giving him Liberty to share uh the rest all the time that he needs and then and then we'll pray all right uh let's see just please bear with me so I I titled this Beyond sorrow unclaimed mantles for a rising Generation Um I will read the dream and then I felt like the lord gave me an interpretation to the dream so I'll read that as well uh this was given in early in the morning um October 27th 2024 I stood in the vestibule of New Hope Revival ministries G gazing through the open doors into the sanctuary where worship was transitioning into prayer brother Wesley gy stood behind the pulpit beginning to lead the congregation the sanctuary was filled with an extraordinary light what those familiar with prophetic encounters might recognize as the cusp of visible Glory that milky white atmosphere that sometimes accompanies God's manifest presence yes in this moment of intense light I felt an inexplicable need to change my clothes though what I wore though what I was wearing wasn't visibly soiled the impulse was clear and compelling stepping through a doorway I entered what appeared to be a bathroom though it felt more like a locker room a dimmer space with traditional fixtures but room enough to change privately the space was notably darker than the sanctuary with old tile floors and an unused quality about it though not ominously so in the back right corner of this room I noticed a small unlit door without conscious thought or curiosity I was drawn to it the door was almost hidden unadorned yet I walked directly to it pushed it open and stepped through I emerged in what appeared to be an abandoned department store it was reminiscent of a Dillards in a mall the space stretched across multiple floors with at least two levels visible and a large spiral staircase Rising through the center endless circular racks of clothes extended wall to wall suit jackets Formal Wear and business attire all covered in years of undisturbed dust the air hung the the air hung stale speaking of Decades of Abandonment sorry near the front of the store to my left sat a solid wood desk positioned like a reception area though it faced the left wall rather than the entrance a small gold table lamp cast weak light into the shadowed space behind the desk sat an imposing figure a tall broad shouldered man standing perhaps s feet or taller with striking blonde hair and strong handsome features he possessed an Angelic quality objectively beautiful in form yet he noticeably lacked the radiance that emanates from one that carries the glory of God when he noticed me he stood and turned instantly I found myself before him who are you I asked my name is sorrow he leaned and whispered near my ear in that moment I I knew instinctively and immediately that I was in a spiritual battle this being intended my destruction a wave of adrenaline hit me as I impulsively Drew back from his presence he wielded a hammer first then created a dark Vortex of weapons axes and other implements hurled towards me with lethal intent though these weapons seem physical they Carri deeper spiritual significance as I retreated towards the door through which I had entered I discovered that sister Stacy and several Young young children perhaps four or five of them had followed in app apparently curious to see what I had discovered in this mysterious space my focus shifted entirely to getting everyone to safety and though I couldn't see it at the time I was being divinely I was being divinely shielded from sorrow's attacks while I offered spiritual resistance not through physical combat but through an intentional standing against his assaults in will emotion and spirit we fled back through the small door and the dream ended in the realm of prophetic dreams so here's my interpretation uh in the realm of prophetic dreams spaces often speak deeper truths than words alone can convey this journey began in a place of corporate worship where the tangible presence of God filled our church with an almost visible Glory this starting point is significant it was the atmosphere of worship as brother gy began to lead the congregation in prayer that the veil between the natural and spiritual began to thin the first stirring of spiritual significance came with an inexplicable need to change clothes this wasn't about physical garments but spoke to a deeper truth rooted in biblical tradition just as priests in the old Testament would change their garments based on their service and as Joshua the high priest received new clothes in Zechariah 3 this impulse pointed to a season of increased sanctification and Spiritual Authority it was a Divine indication that the current spiritual garments though not necessarily defiled were insufficient for the next season of ministry the transition through the bathroom locker room space carries its own significance in prophetic symbolism such spaces of such spaces often represent cleansing and preparation yes the washing of the Water by the word amen though dimmer than the sanctuary this space wasn't forboding but rather Preparatory and intimate a necessary transition point between present experience and future inheritance the discovery of the hidden unadorned door in the back corner speaks to how God often conceals profound spiritual Treasures in overlooked places the drawing to this door wasn't born of curiosity but of divine leading a principle we see throughout scripture where God's most significant Revelations often come through humble passages the abandoned department store with its vast collection of formal attire spread across multiple floors representing something profound a reservoir of spiritual mantel and Authority that God has preserved for this generation these aren't casual garments but Formal Wear about my father's business kind of attire speaking to the dignity and gravity of the Spiritual Authority they represent the dust covering these garments tells a story of inheritance temporarily forgotten but not diminished in power or significance the Pres of Sorrow that imposing almost beautiful figure reveals a crucial truth about spiritual advancement yes here stands a territorial principality positioned as an unauthorized gatekeeper over spiritual inheritance that doesn't belong to him his beauty without Radiance speaks to how the enemy often presents himself impressive but lacking True Glory his violent response to to Discovery illustrates a pattern we see throughout scripture when God's people approach their inheritance opposition intensifies yet Perhaps most significant is the generational Dynamic revealed in this encounter yes three distinct Generations were present the children representing untarnished faith and natural spiritual curiosity the middle generation represented by myself positioned to both receive and protect and the leadership generation represented by Stacy in a maternal guiding role this wasn't merely about individual inheritance but about multi-generational transfer of Spiritual Authority yes the timing of this dream coming in the wake of tragic loss within our congregation speaks powerfully to God's heart for his people e even as sorrow attempts to establish his authority through grief and loss God reveals a vast Storehouse of unclaimed Spiritual Authority awaiting his people amen the enemy's violent reaction you actually confirms the significance of what God has prepared this dream serves as both a warning and a profound encouragement it warns of the enemy's desire to prevent God's people from claiming claiming their spiritual inheritance through intimidation fear and sorrow yet it also reveals the the enemy's limitations despite his imposing presence he could neither prevent the discovery of these mantel nor successfully attack when met with spiritual resistance the call emerging from this dream is clear there is a corporate destiny that requires multi-generational participation the younger generation's Natural Curiosity toward spiritual things the middle generation's responsibility to both claim and protect and the leadership generation's role and guiding all are crucial for for possessing what God has prepared the progression is significant from corporate worship that creates an atmosphere of Glory to individual recognition of Need For Greater authority to discovery of vast unclaimed inheritance to facing an overcoming opposition all while protecting multiple Generations under Divine covering this pattern suggests that advancing into greater Spiritual Authority requires both individual preparation and corporate movement for New Hope Revival ministries this dream arrives at a critical moment a chyos time between deep sorrow and divine inheritance it reveals that even in the aftermath of tragedy God has preserved something magnificent for his people the dust on those mantel isn't permanent it's waiting to be brushed off by those willing to press past opposition to claim what God has prepared this is more than a dream of personal preparation or individual calling it's a vision of corporate Destiny of multi-generational inheritance of Authority Long abandoned but not diminished it's a call to recognize that what appears as a place of Sorrow can actually Mark the threshold of claiming in unprecedented Spiritual Authority Hallelujah most importantly it's an assurance that even in confronting profound opposition God's people move forward under Divine protection carrying not just their own inheritance but helping secure it for generations to come hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah tell us what we can do what do we do about so n naturally uh you know what so I have God has blessed me very much with uh three children and uh many of you know when you have young kids sleep is uh very hard to get and so our house often times in the night is a juggle between my wife and I um and this night um I found myself all my kids were in our bed and I was in Enoch's bed by myself uh and you know I I've been serving the lord for 15 years now and um I have had many different spiritual I've had countless spiritual warfare dreams in that time I almost would have dismissed this dream but I had never seen an emotion personified in that way I don't know how to communicate it other than just I experienced it um and so then I couldn't get away from it and I came here I think we had to count the next day and uh I tried to secretly kind of tell Hawk and Hawk's like hey you need to tell Benjamin and so then we just got got into it and uh I just started kind of pouring out of it like what I had experienced and what I thought it was kind of what what I felt the Lord was telling me it was meaning it meant um so here is my application for me I started I don't want to focus on sorrow I I I do feel like he is significant I feel like that I feel like I feel like forgive me if I'm just if I I don't know how to speak but to just kind of speak plain we're very ignorant of of what's going on in the spirit realm I I unless God reveals it to us which he wants to and he and he can so I'm very often ignorant of what God is accomplishing in the spirit and and I don't don't really think we understand what's taking place in the realm of the spirit when we're meeting here weak after week after week and contending for the Manifest glory of God Amen we really start stirring things up you know the the my so the first place I went was this this idea it's based out of Revelation 12 the Manchild caught up to the throne it's when we go up he comes down and so again I don't want to dwell too much on this but it's it's there are I mean I kind of quoted in in in my prayer this morning he's far above principalities Powers the rulers of Darkness of this world and spiritual wickedness where in high places right it's the same word we are seated with Christ where high places in high places it's the same word and so when we go up and actually rightfully occupy that place those things are displaced and they come down and if you read Revelation 12 they're angry and they're upset that's right and if you study revivals it happened in church history when God was pouring out his blessings I think brother brandham said it the asylums were filling up and so we're ignorant of those things and we you know we shouldn't be we need and so okay so that's like one so it's like so then so then what do I do so I went to Revelation 3 I started studying garments you know like I I was standing out in the vestibule I was looking through an open door and there was visible glory in here and I felt a an inexplicable need to change my clothes of course I'm all like I start getting I get really self-aware when I have a dream like that and it's like okay what am I doing wrong like evaluating my life what can I put right is God is God kind of judging me or or whatever but it's it's actually what I think that you know is kind of expressed in the dream he just it's it's not even that my garments are soiled but they're insufficient to the place that he's calling me to and so then I started studying garments and I'm not you're going to get the abbreviated version but I went to the Church of leoa Revelation 3 and to the Church of leody deia write you know every single church he says I know your works every single church he says I know your works because that's the very first thing that we want to present to the Lord is what we've done and he kind in some sense he's just dismissive I know your works but you know so and there's an indictment against the church leoda and he says I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that you may be rich and white garments to cover the shame of your nakedness right and a thought hit me garments shame nakedness where have I heard that before yeah Genesis 3 and so Genesis and Revelation again they're tied together and so I went back to Genesis 3 and again I'm like I'm not this is just for me this is what I feel like God has been telling me so you have the transgression of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and God comes down and he says Adam where are you and Adam says we heard your voice we saw that we were naked and we hid ourselves yes and there's one verse that says unto Adam and to his wife also the Lord God made them coats of skins the word made there is the same word when it says and the Lord made the stars and the Lord made the Earth and and the Animals the same care and attention that God created the universe he gave to these garments that he was fashioning for his son and his daughter yes so there is an offering there are five levitical offerings the burnt offering the peace offering the meal offering the sin offering the trespass offering the burnt offering is a very interesting offering because it's entirely consumed save one thing which is the skin and so I started thinking about like I put myself into the story my wife can my wife and my mom and Hawk can tell you it's like I I I love narrative the power of story do I love Doctrine I love theology but but there is a kind of an emotion that's why I lik writing this dream because it kind of brings you into the picture and you can see it and so I was living in that portion of text and was seeing the logos come down searching for his son not because he didn't know where he was but because Adam didn't know where he was where he was he had never been lost before he had never known death before and his father now is transitioning from Creator to priest yes and he offers a sacrifice and he kills an animal yes that at least typed the burnt offering where the offering was wholly con consumed saved the skins and the Skins were saved for the priest and then God used those skins to cover his his son and his daughter yes so then I started studying the burnt offering and the burnt offering it basically it it ties into what you were saying today like the meat of it is is its entire consecration unto God and so you have Romans 121 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present yourself as living sacrifices this is your spiritual act of worship and so I am taking away from this dream that you know we are getting through yes you know we are we are we are changing Ing and shifting something in in in the realm of the spirit in the heavens you know it it is Progressive it's it's not instantaneous and that is the goodness of God because if God were to fully manifest himself fully to us right now I wouldn't be you might be alive but I wouldn't be alive and so it's it's it's it's from glory to glory from glory to glory and so for me I feel like uh it's a season of Consecration and obedience Hebrews says in in burnt offerings and sacrifices I take no pleasure but Lo it's written of me in the volume of the book I have come to do thy will and so it's Consecration and its obedience and I believe that's the path forward to to receiving you know the the mantles The Authority The Inheritance that God has reserved for us and and we need it we you know we have to have a vision that we're setting ourselves towards because Proverbs without Vision the people perish but without Vision the people cast off restraint you know and so Vision it it aligns us Allah is the burnt offering and it means to ascend you know which you know it's a season of mountain climbing we're trying to ascend the mountain so I just have all of those those things kind of roaming around but the Crux of it for me is just Consecration and obedience Consecration and obedience Consecration and obedience and the same way that God was faithful to clothe his son and daughter Adam and Eve after the transgression and here's the last thing I'm going to say it was a department store it wasn't like uh uh a guarded room in a palace it was malls are publicly accessible and there so it's for everybody it's for Enoch and Sophia it's for it's for the the youngest and it's for the eldest and I believe that that Reservoir holds something for each of us that's worth contending for that that the enemy is obviously trying to keep us from obtaining and so we can't come into agreement with it we need to continue to press in you know Cor and then individually consecrate ourselves and walk in obedience powerful isn't that [Applause] powerful Hallelujah that's a gift it's worth it it's worth it to press in let's have the worship team come and let's make up our minds today that we're going to enter into a season of fresh consecration total sanctification and obedience we're being set apart not to sit down but we're being set set apart to move into action it's I I I I love the balance I love the representation of all the generations this generation can't do it without an older generation coming along cheering them on and praying them through and pushing them forward and the children depend the children are depending on us on the other two generations they're depending on us they've got to be prepared for whatever is to come it seems quite prophetic that this is the season that that we were brought to these circumstances Tabernacles the last feast the Feast of the open book our country is in an election there is a line being drawn in the sand for the future of our nation and the bride her time has come she is a multi-generational many membered bride worldwide bride she's got to make it you say well I can't get my eyes on the broader picture because I'm going through so much on a personal level but that's really contrary thinking because you've absolutely got to shift from your personal struggle to see the bigger picture to see that God has prepared everything you need to overcome it's hanging there for those who will pursue it those who will consecrate and dedicate uh I think we've I think we've received a gift from the Lord this morning through that dream through the through the Holy Ghost interpretation of the dream and the way that it stirs us and not just sorrow any any number of of enemies of emotions can stand as an enemy to try to prevent you from your inheritance for some it's just Envy and jealousies whatever it is sorrow seems to be the big one for this season but whatever your hindrance is know that when you desire to move in the opposite Spirit you're going to get hammers thrown at you when you rise up to overcome anything that's trying to overcome you you're going to disturb the atmosphere and you're going to become even a bigger Target for the enemy me in that moment you can't pull back in that moment you've got to you've got to press in you've got to strive even harder push a little harder contend a little harder so that that it will Retreat it has to retreat nothing can stand against the the the Spirit-filled Blood Bought bride Church of Jesus Christ but you've got to raise up and flex your muscles sometime you've got to show the enemy that you know what you're carrying it's by Grace it's certainly by Grace amen let's worship let's worship before we go uh we're going to pray some a couple have asked for prayer but but let's worship before we do that let's make this time a time of consecration let let's not consecrate and rededicate if we don't intend to obey let's go ahead and get it all settled and let's say Lord if you will clean me if you will help purify me and dress me I will step in I will obey I will pursue the anointings and the giftings and the mantel that are part of my inheritance let's tell the Lord that as we worship now but God is good to us hallelujah hallelujah let the king of my heart be the mountain where I run yes Fountain I drink from oh he is my song come on and let the king of my heart be the shadow where I hide the ransom for my life oh he

few weeks ago really a few months ago that if he got this far we would pray for him as he ENT into uh a chapter uh of of school and training to uh fulfill a dream that he has for a career it's a big deal and he has already overcome some obstacles and odds in the sense that school was not his favorite thing I happened to know where he in ited that from I lay down across the foot of your dad's bed when he was a young boy and I said you will get up and you will come to school now and you will finish and he did he uh has already broken through that plateau and has done quite well but tomorrow he starts the big deal school and God seems to me has worked out some things that will make it both convenient and pleasant and also extra hard so we want to pray that God will cover him and protect him and help him to retain all that he needs to retain and if this is God's perfect will for his life that he will open the door close all other doors that are not of him give him peace most of all we want this to be something that draws him closer to the Lord not not take him farther away so let's let's believe God let's anoint him and believe that God will use this for his purposes father in the name of Jesus it was his desire he ask for this moment of prayer we lay our hands on him now in the authority of Jesus Christ and we ask you Lord to cover him may he find Refuge underneath your wings may he be protected underneath your wings father stir him Jesus draw him to your side may he retain may he learn Lord may he consume what he needs to know in preparation for what you have for him we break off distraction in the name of Jesus and and we break off every side trail that the enemy might like to lead him on that wouldn't take closer to the goal we break that off in the name of the Lord Jesus and we ask for single-mindedness to be upon him a and may he be empowered and encouraged to know that he can because you said so we thank you Lord for what he has already accomplished with your help we celebrate what he has broken through to get to where he is today and we ask that you go with him may he also rededicate and reconsecrate his heart and Life to you today as you come alongside to help him Lord in every step of this training and school Endeavor Lord thank you thank you for reaching him for drawing him Lord may he be a light may he break the mold may he resist the need to fit in and may he have a backbone may may he be like a salmon in a in a in a ocean of jellyfish may he stand for what is right what is righteous what is Holy Father we ask that you get Glory you get Glory out of his life you called him from his mother's womb and now Lord we need you to wrap him up in your love and care in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus we thank you thank you Lord hallelujah hallelujah my goodness you're big love you proud of you you are good sing good you are good you are good oh you are good you are good oh excuse me I want us to pray for Megan now that God would just bless and strengthen her and help her in every way she has had a a hard time H God is a god of hard times he he knows he understands he sees but you know if we just took this dream yeah and just applied it to their loss also uh not in any way to minimalize it or or deit what am I looking for the word I'm looking for delegitimize their sorrow but but to say okay now if this emotion should raise up as an enemy to try to keep you then then it's got to be dealt with just like we would deal with any enemy so please know that it's all right to hurt and to be sad and we have no right to tell you how to get over it or what to get you know it's just not our place but if this thing seeks to settle and keep you from getting your clothes off the rack your inheritance then we have to deal with it as such and I think that's kind of the inspiration that I'm feeling so reach your hand toward her father in the name name of Jesus we we just honor we honor your will and your plan for their lives you have made precious promises over them both and we have seen them rise we've seen them grow we've seen them move closer to you and our hearts break for their loss but today we ask that you would break off yes any way that the enemy would try to attach himself to this situation in the name of Jesus Oh strengthen her in every way may she not be impeded or handicapped by this emotion but but may she be inspired really inspired to press past everything that would distract to take a hold of your precious promises for their lives as your servants now only you can heal a broken heart and only you can mend what has been lost but you can in such a way that you get glory for your name may may she just be empowered [Music] oh is to rise to the top Jesus you have an ordained way for this pain to become fuel to recharge to if that was not your plan you would have never allowed this to cross their path J so we ask you to redeem every portion of this emotion of this loss deep deep loss redeem It For Your Glory and and may she Girt up spiritually may she Girt up and and be ready to run is Lord right now may she feel this body coming alongside of her not to judge but to support and to say we are with you and we're watching you rise we're watching you rise to the top we're watching you use this moment as a catalyst to propel you further yeah into the callings of God thank you spirit thank
