[55:45] I hope I'm not out of order I hope I'm
[55:47] obeying God but
[55:49] excuse me
[55:51] When you mention Tracy Borden
[55:54] I know all those Folks up in there you
[55:57] know I've been knowing them I've been
[55:58] knowing her all of her life
[56:02] um I know you don't know her and you may
[56:04] not remember this
[56:06] but I think that we should share things
[56:10] like this with our young people so
[56:11] they'll know
[56:13] you know and then when things happen you
[56:15] know they'll appreciate the Lord
[56:17] allowing them
[56:19] experience it but this Tracy Borden
[56:23] as a young woman she's had a bunch of
[56:27] kids a lot of kids
[56:29] um don't talk proper song they're kids
[56:32] but um
[56:35] her mother was in one of your meetings
[56:37] one time I don't know if you remembered
[56:39] or not when we were on Creek
[56:41] Road
[56:42] I knew her very well

[56:47] about middle ways and I had invited her
[56:50] to come and visit us she lived in
[56:52] LaGrange all of her life

[57:44] passed away but prayed for her you

[57:55] imprisoned than she was that one
[57:58] she was so tormented

[58:02] give her peace and God did

[1:13:14] the agreement with the word of God
[1:13:17] while there is singing while there is a

[1:16:52] Glory Glory
[1:17:00] just had a
[1:17:03] small picture Flash in front of me
[1:17:08] and it looked like a it looked like a
[1:17:10] belt
[1:17:12] it's like you would hold your pants up
[1:17:13] with it
[1:17:15] but it looked like that it was being let
[1:17:17] loose for something that was strapped to
[1:17:20] you
[1:17:21] that you didn't need
[1:17:24] just Just Let it Loose
[1:17:27] Let it Loose
[1:17:29] let it fall behind you
[1:17:33] let it fall behind you
[1:17:36] the doubt the criticisms
[1:17:40] the divisions
[1:17:41] [Music]
[1:17:43] the the the Dual Visions the division
[1:17:47] let it go let it fall behind you today
[1:17:51] because all of these things that you
[1:17:54] literally allow to remain strapped to
[1:17:57] you they hinder the the octane of the
[1:18:02] word of God
[1:18:03] from being as effective in our lives
[1:18:08] with it as it would be without it so if
[1:18:12] we'll just let it fall behind us
[1:18:18] I don't know what you battle with
[1:18:21] you're a human being so I know that you
[1:18:23] do
[1:18:24] but just let it fall behind you today so
[1:18:29] that the octane the the Dynamics of the
[1:18:33] word of God
[1:18:35] mixed with the mechanics of the word of
[1:18:38] God can be the complete
[1:18:42] combustion engine that it needs to be to
[1:18:47] move us forward
[1:18:49] in the things of God
[1:18:52] Hallelujah
[1:18:56] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:18:59] oh we bless you Lord
[1:19:05] if the same
[1:19:08] spirit that raised Christ from the dead

[1:19:23] Christ from the dead dwell in you dwell
[1:19:28] in you on it will Quicken your mortal
[1:19:34] body
[1:19:35] if that Spirit dwell in you hold it will
[1:19:43] Quicken your mortal body
[1:19:46] give that Spirit dwell in you oh if the
[1:19:53] same Holy Spirit praise Christ from the

[1:20:07] from the dead dwell in you dwell in you
[1:20:13] oh it will Quicken
[1:20:15] your mortal body
[1:20:18] tip that

[1:21:27] offering today usually on the first
[1:21:29] Sunday of the month we receive the
[1:21:31] special offering for the principal of
[1:21:34] the mortgage of this property and we
[1:21:36] told you on Tuesday night that we have a
[1:21:39] uh insurance payment that is due on the
[1:21:42] 5th we need to make sure that this
[1:21:44] property is insured uh and of course we
[1:21:47] all know that product has gone up
[1:21:49] everything has gone up and so our
[1:21:51] insurance has also increased by 700
[1:21:54] every six months but I would like to
[1:21:57] report to you that on Tuesday night that
[1:22:00] 700 was given in an offering so we want
[1:22:04] to thank the Lord for that
[1:22:10] so that means we need 3 738 dollars
[1:22:15] three thousand seven hundred thirty
[1:22:17] eight dollars to take care of this
[1:22:18] insurance payment for six months to take
[1:22:21] care of this property we want to give as
[1:22:24] we're not giving as uh trying to make
[1:22:28] sure that this building insured although
[1:22:31] that's where it's going we want to give
[1:22:33] as giving unto the Lord because this is
[1:22:37] our place of worship this is a ground
[1:22:39] that we feel comfortable to come and and

[1:26:17] praise God
[1:26:19] you may be seated isn't the Lord
[1:26:22] wonderful
[1:26:24] oh
[1:26:26] you know the presence of the Lord was so
[1:26:29] real during worship
[1:26:32] I I can't tell you how long it's been
[1:26:35] since I I literally just lost my breath
[1:26:41] in his presence it just left me
[1:26:44] and I caught myself gasping
[1:26:46] to get a breath of air
[1:26:49] maybe I was breathing in Heaven's
[1:26:52] atmosphere
[1:26:53] and had to catch a little oxygen to stay
[1:26:55] alive but I don't care it was just it
[1:26:59] was so real and so tangible and if you
[1:27:02] missed it I'm so sorry you missed it
[1:27:04] those of you who are at home streaming
[1:27:07] who could have been here I'm sorry for
[1:27:10] you because I know you get a good
[1:27:13] blessing and you can experience his
[1:27:15] presence there but I don't care what
[1:27:18] people say there's nothing there's
[1:27:21] nothing like being in the corporate
[1:27:24] presence of God
[1:27:26] so I'm so thankful for streaming uh
[1:27:29] sister Judith can tell you how helpful
[1:27:33] it is to have streaming it has been the
[1:27:37] only church that her parents have had
[1:27:39] for nearly 30 years and it's vital to be
[1:27:43] able to have some contact with a body of
[1:27:47] Believers we're all supposed to be
[1:27:49] connected to a body somewhere amen but
[1:27:52] there's nothing like being in that
[1:27:55] presence of the Lord for yourself we
[1:27:59] should never take it for granted
[1:28:02] I'm just kind of waiting on you to get
[1:28:04] your attention back to me
[1:28:06] we should never take it for granted
[1:28:09] we should always give God praise
[1:28:13] and thank him
[1:28:15] and so we wonderful just seems like it's
[1:28:18] been so long since we were in church and
[1:28:21] we were just here Tuesday night
[1:28:23] and thank you for thinking of us and
[1:28:25] praying for us we just went two nights
[1:28:27] Thursday night and Friday night to North
[1:28:30] Georgia it had been a long long time
[1:28:32] many years since I had been in Helen in
[1:28:35] that area if you've never had a chance
[1:28:37] to visit it it's it's it's up again
[1:28:39] there were some years that it kind of
[1:28:42] went down and it just wasn't it wasn't
[1:28:44] all that particularly nice but it's nice
[1:28:47] again and the weather you know the
[1:28:50] weather we just watched the weather
[1:28:51] change we were supposed to get some of
[1:28:55] the rain and wind because of where we
[1:28:57] were and it just passed and you had nice
[1:29:00] weather here too didn't you God was so
[1:29:02] good to us that doesn't mean that we
[1:29:04] don't pray for those who have gone
[1:29:06] through such horrible loss it is a price
[1:29:11] it's a horrible price to pay but we're
[1:29:14] so thankful that God is helping people
[1:29:16] and so many have gone to to render Aid
[1:29:21] and uh we just pray I've prayed every
[1:29:24] day I know you have that God will make a
[1:29:26] way for those people especially those
[1:29:29] who are grieving the loss of loved ones
[1:29:31] you know folks property can be replaced
[1:29:34] it may not be your your old stuff but it
[1:29:38] can be replaced but lives that that's
[1:29:40] where the grief really lies so we want
[1:29:43] to lift those Folks up to prayer
[1:29:47] I'm waiting on Michael is he coming back
[1:29:49] in
[1:29:51] all right why don't we just I'm not
[1:29:54] going to sing we've had an hour of
[1:29:55] singing and worship let's just thank
[1:29:57] these musicians and these singers for
[1:30:00] everything that they have given
[1:30:06] you might want to listen up here for
[1:30:09] some of the announcements that we have
[1:30:12] camp meeting begins a week from this
[1:30:15] Tuesday night October the 11th through
[1:30:18] the 16th we will be having church every
[1:30:22] night at seven o'clock Saturday night at
[1:30:25] six
[1:30:26] so Tuesday through Friday at 7 Saturday
[1:30:30] night at six and Sunday morning at 11.
[1:30:33] we'll be letting you know in the next
[1:30:35] few days how many nights we will provide
[1:30:38] food
[1:30:39] sister Rebecca's family is is your whole
[1:30:42] family still coming
[1:30:44] sister Rebecca's whole family is coming
[1:30:46] sister uh Terry her mother and
[1:30:49] grandmother and her siblings and uh
[1:30:53] her dad going to be here in the services
[1:30:56] and so uh we're excited about that we
[1:31:00] heard just a few days ago that brother
[1:31:02] Magnuson is coming from Iceland we're
[1:31:06] excited about that we haven't been able
[1:31:08] to see him in a few years and there are
[1:31:11] some other streamers who are coming and
[1:31:15] uh you know this is a special camp
[1:31:17] meeting it's different than any we've
[1:31:19] had in a long time but it just feels
[1:31:21] good there's something about it that God
[1:31:24] has ordained it to be this way this year
[1:31:27] it's a little embarrassing for a pastor
[1:31:30] to be speaking in his own meeting
[1:31:32] but when I say that it reminds us of the
[1:31:36] old days
[1:31:37] because we used to have two weeks of
[1:31:40] camp meeting I preached every night the
[1:31:43] first week
[1:31:45] and then we had a special speaker or two
[1:31:47] in the SEC can you imagine just be
[1:31:49] honest
[1:31:50] were we crazy or just anointed or just
[1:31:53] young
[1:31:55] we were just young
[1:31:57] Sunday to Sunday to Sunday
[1:32:00] and sometimes morning Services too
[1:32:04] a couple times three day three days a
[1:32:06] week we had morning the first camp
[1:32:08] meeting we had morning Services every
[1:32:09] morning
[1:32:11] and uh I don't know how God was just
[1:32:13] good to us those were fat wouldn't you
[1:32:16] love to have the strength to commit to
[1:32:18] that again
[1:32:19] I've already
[1:32:20] only two of us
[1:32:22] don't you pretend like you already have
[1:32:25] it
[1:32:26] you know you're already weary you've
[1:32:28] been worshiping an hour and 27 minutes
[1:32:30] and you're already pooped
[1:32:32] I'm gonna have to drag some of you to
[1:32:34] the word this morning
[1:32:36] but you know God strengthened us he
[1:32:39] helped us it was hot July
[1:32:42] our first camp meetings were July under
[1:32:46] the 10 top Tabernacle
[1:32:49] the first year a hurricane a spun a
[1:32:52] tropical storm
[1:32:53] that they call the great deluge
[1:32:57] God said that which he had given us a
[1:32:59] prophecy and said that which man has
[1:33:02] borrowed from the Beavers
[1:33:05] will explode
[1:33:07] and you know there were dams that broke
[1:33:09] All Over Georgia up through even in
[1:33:11] Alabama and all up the East Coast
[1:33:14] and uh something that had come from camp
[1:33:16] meeting the interstate flooded in
[1:33:19] Georgia
[1:33:20] the interstate was flooded
[1:33:23] and uh we had put out some grass seed
[1:33:26] and God said I will protect this place
[1:33:30] and he did and did you know the
[1:33:33] hurricane rains we had a lot of rains
[1:33:35] but did you know it never even washed
[1:33:37] the grass seed off the hill God was that
[1:33:40] good and did he ever do some outstanding
[1:33:43] things so we it should it'll be kind of
[1:33:47] small and a little intimate but it's
[1:33:49] going to be a great blessing and we have
[1:33:52] so many who've never experienced a week
[1:33:54] of meetings here that are with us now
[1:33:56] and we're going to have the tents up and
[1:33:59] we're going to feed people we'll let you
[1:34:01] know again how many nights we think we
[1:34:03] can pull that off because we want these
[1:34:05] visitors to be to be treated with great
[1:34:08] hospitality and we want you to get in on
[1:34:11] the fellowship what brother Greeley was
[1:34:13] saying today is so important that we
[1:34:16] hear these testimonies I mentioned that
[1:34:18] a few weeks ago we went down and took
[1:34:21] dinner when Hawk and Maribeth were in
[1:34:24] Iceland we took dinner down to Sister
[1:34:26] Weems and sister Royale and we had a
[1:34:28] meal our whole family had a meal feel
[1:34:31] there and I wanted her to give her
[1:34:33] testimony of how God had brought her
[1:34:35] here and and even our kids who had
[1:34:38] probably heard us share it at some point
[1:34:41] it was new to them all over again and it
[1:34:44] was wonderful to hear and sister Flo
[1:34:46] sharing this this morning was a real
[1:34:48] blessing to me and you know God is the
[1:34:51] same
[1:34:52] he is the same
[1:34:54] and I can't help but but remember that
[1:34:57] today is brother biscoll's birthday and
[1:35:01] uh he is 88 years old today we should
[1:35:04] pray for him he is not strong as he once
[1:35:07] was but we should pray for him that God
[1:35:10] will continue to strengthen him and help
[1:35:13] him tomorrow is Sister Kate Dane's
[1:35:16] birthday we want to say hello an old
[1:35:19] time streamer of a friend of ours we

[1:37:32] uh twenty five thousand dollars
[1:37:35] you know that's I know it's private
[1:37:37] business

[1:37:40] she took her birthday
[1:37:42] her
[1:37:44] Hanukkah her graduation
[1:37:47] and she walked in and when I told my
[1:37:49] friend Assad
[1:37:51] uh
[1:37:53] her story he said preacher he said
[1:37:57] there's not a finance company around
[1:37:59] here that's not going with this
[1:38:01] because she didn't have to finance much
[1:38:04] and when they find out that they're more
[1:38:06] than willing and they were bidding for
[1:38:09] her business
[1:38:10] and so they told her they said you went
[1:38:12] from a zero credit score today to a
[1:38:15] mighty Goodwin in six months
[1:38:17] so she got the vehicle that she wanted
[1:38:19] he called and said uh that there was one
[1:38:22] and we'd have to put a deposit on it
[1:38:24] site unseen that could be refunded I
[1:38:27] said we will no problem it's done five
[1:38:31] salesmen tried to buy it out from under
[1:38:33] him they were they were circling the
[1:38:35] desk while I was sitting there talking
[1:38:37] to them they were circling the desk
[1:38:38] these vehicles are popular and hard to
[1:38:41] come by and the the manager called him
[1:38:44] in and said you know that we always Mark
[1:38:46] these because of the of the value I mean
[1:38:49] the desire for these vehicles we always
[1:38:51] mark them and sell them five thousand
[1:38:53] dollars over invoice
[1:38:55] and the uh the the salesman looked at
[1:38:58] him he said I can't do that he said
[1:39:00] that's preacher
[1:39:02] he said that man prays for me every
[1:39:04] Friday
[1:39:07] and God hears his prayers
[1:39:10] he said I'm salesman of the month again
[1:39:12] this month because of preacher
[1:39:15] he said there's no way in the world that
[1:39:17] I can charge him and he said for the
[1:39:19] first time since I've been working here

[1:39:23] said do whatever you want to he said I'm
[1:39:25] going to sell it on the sticker like
[1:39:26] like
[1:39:28] he said I'm gonna make I'm gonna make
[1:39:30] nothing on it but he said I don't need
[1:39:33] to because I've made plenty of money on
[1:39:35] preachers prayers
[1:39:37] now that's his testimony
[1:39:40] it's God who did it
[1:39:45] he is not a message believer but I sent
[1:39:47] him the same text since the day he sold
[1:39:49] me my vehicle I sent him the same Friday

[1:41:30] man Michael
[1:41:34] I'm going to do this now
[1:41:37] instead of at the end because you know
[1:41:39] how bad I am to forget
[1:41:41] Michael has a testimony you can tell us
[1:41:43] how God's touched your back
[1:41:46] and then if you've got any other thing
[1:41:47] you other news you want to share with us
[1:41:49] you can
[1:41:51] okay uh
[1:41:54] let's see about I guess be about three
[1:41:56] months ago now yes three months ago now
[1:41:59] I woke up one morning and I could
[1:42:02] hardly walk
[1:42:04] and uh
[1:42:08] I guess
[1:42:09] the greatest well there's nothing great
[1:42:11] about it it hurt but the greatest thing
[1:42:14] about having to go through all that is
[1:42:16] that
[1:42:18] my face never really wavered yes uh and
[1:42:22] all of it the God would uh heal me and I
[1:42:26] never got a
[1:42:28] not for lack of believing I
[1:42:30] promise you that I never
[1:42:32] tania's
[1:42:34] but
[1:42:36] I just
[1:42:37] a few times I got discouraged but most
[1:42:39] of the time I just did not feel that way
[1:42:41] right
[1:42:43] um
[1:42:45] and uh
[1:42:47] I've noticed uh once several times in
[1:42:49] life and on things like this
[1:42:52] and where I was sick or I've never had
[1:42:54] an injury where I couldn't move I've
[1:42:56] just
[1:42:57] like a broken ankle or so something like
[1:42:59] that it's
[1:43:00] usually a cold that puts me out for a
[1:43:02] little while but um
[1:43:04] I remember uh
[1:43:07] I would be directed I
[1:43:10] I keep a collection of um
[1:43:13] Bible movies which that's a broad term
[1:43:16] it may not necessarily be the Bible but
[1:43:18] uh it could be something like Overcomer
[1:43:21] or courageous in one of those movies but
[1:43:24] um I keep a collection of those and
[1:43:27] I don't know why but I always feel when
[1:43:29] I'm in a situation like that drawing to
[1:43:31] them for a specific reason sure and um
[1:43:34] this time going through this I felt
[1:43:37] really compelled to watch the old
[1:43:40] series Jesus of Nazareth yes from the
[1:43:43] 70s and uh I watched that through once
[1:43:46] again saw through that
[1:43:48] um I went back and watched
[1:43:51] The Passion of the Christ again I know
[1:43:53] Mel Gibson's not the most moral
[1:43:55] individual in the world maybe but his
[1:43:58] movie is
[1:44:00] the best unprecedented yeah it is it
[1:44:03] really is but
[1:44:05] um
[1:44:06] also looked into something I never
[1:44:09] looked into before
[1:44:10] um I have never listened to Billy Graham
[1:44:12] ever never even felt
[1:44:15] compelled
[1:44:17] to uh uh well you know listen to blood
[1:44:20] Graham you watch Billy Graham
[1:44:23] I did and I think the reason I was
[1:44:25] directed towards those movies and to
[1:44:28] watching him was actually how he put it
[1:44:32] he always lifted up the cross yes always
[1:44:35] stood and mostly he was preaching to
[1:44:38] people you know he needed to know the
[1:44:40] Lord to get saved but he left up the
[1:44:43] cross you also lift up
[1:44:46] the healing power
[1:44:47] amen so all I thank the Lord that no it
[1:44:51] wasn't pleasant having to go through all
[1:44:53] of that and having to be out of work for
[1:44:55] about two months
[1:44:57] I learned a lot
[1:44:59] about myself and
[1:45:03] spiritually about how to really trust
[1:45:05] the Lord and how to handle things yes
[1:45:07] and yes Crystal and I have an
[1:45:11] announcement uh Kim is a little bit of a
[1:45:13] surprise to us

[1:46:46] about big birthdays so let us say happy
[1:46:49] birthday to them
[1:46:53] that's worth mentioning
[1:46:56] let's stand for the word
[1:46:59] oh he's good
[1:47:02] he is so so good
[1:47:07] I'm just gonna have you to to go again
[1:47:11] to Second Corinthians
[1:47:14] chapter 10.
[1:47:17] verse 3 through 6. I hope you have some
[1:47:20] strength to pull on the word and the
[1:47:22] gift today
[1:47:24] let's believe that God will move and
[1:47:27] help us
[1:47:29] this is an important uh portion of
[1:47:32] scripture to kind of finish out maybe
[1:47:34] finish out the series
[1:47:37] sister green texted me this week and she
[1:47:39] said I'm I'm ready for part two of
[1:47:41] Tuesday nights
[1:47:43] she enjoyed the the talk that we did on
[1:47:46] the red heifer and uh so we'll keep you
[1:47:48] updated on that as things continue to
[1:47:51] transpire
[1:47:54] for though we walk in the flesh
[1:47:57] we do not war after the flesh for the
[1:48:02] weapons of our Warfare are not carnal
[1:48:07] where the shaw yelled out in inspiration
[1:48:10] to us that that we are his weapons
[1:48:14] and true we're filled with his name
[1:48:16] we're filled with his word we're filled
[1:48:19] with the spirit we become the weapons we
[1:48:23] also become the plowshares that he uses
[1:48:26] for the Harvest no doubt about it for
[1:48:29] the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:48:30] carnal but what
[1:48:32] Mighty through God to the pulling down
[1:48:36] of of strongholds casting down
[1:48:41] imaginations this is a work of effort it
[1:48:46] is not an automatic deal it's something
[1:48:48] you have to consciously do by living in
[1:48:52] the present by staying in the moment
[1:48:55] casting down imaginations and every High
[1:49:00] thing that exalteth itself against the
[1:49:03] knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:49:06] captivity putting in prison every
[1:49:10] thought to The Obedience of Christ I
[1:49:15] want you to get this this thought this
[1:49:17] is literally binding every thought
[1:49:22] to Christ
[1:49:23] binding it to Christ and remembering his
[1:49:28] obedience
[1:49:29] it goes on and having in a Readiness to
[1:49:34] Revenge all Disobedience when your
[1:49:39] obedience is fulfilled spend a little
[1:49:43] time around your own back door
[1:49:46] making sure that you have obeyed God
[1:49:50] before you worry about someone else's
[1:49:52] obedience isn't that good
[1:49:56] may God help us Lord we look to you
[1:49:59] today if we went home right now we would
[1:50:02] say we have surely been in the presence
[1:50:06] of the Lord but every moment up until
[1:50:09] this moment prepares us to receive an
[1:50:14] installment of your word not by letter
[1:50:18] only but by the anointed living
[1:50:22] breathing moving ever active word of God
[1:50:28] so we ask that you would Inspire each
[1:50:32] one of us to receive that word and that
[1:50:35] you would Inspire us to obey this word
[1:50:38] and that you would remind us to do it in
[1:50:43] a on a daily basis when our busyness of
[1:50:46] life would cause us to forget the
[1:50:49] importance of binding every thought to
[1:50:53] The Obedience of Christ we call out for
[1:50:55] your help help today we ask for you to
[1:50:59] help us now as we work together in your
[1:51:02] anointing and we ask for this in the
[1:51:05] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for
[1:51:08] his glory and the Saints said
[1:51:11] amen you may be seated
[1:51:15] because the enemy's ultimate desire is
[1:51:21] to cause death
[1:51:23] the Bible said the thief has come to
[1:51:28] steal to kill and to
[1:51:33] to steal to
[1:51:36] kill and to one more time to steal to
[1:51:42] kill and to destroy and we don't want to
[1:51:46] give him any praise
[1:51:47] we don't want to brag on the enemy today
[1:51:50] but we want to say this he's very busy
[1:51:53] very diligently stealing killing and
[1:51:58] destroying
[1:52:00] but Jesus said in the next place John 10
[1:52:03] 10 he said but I am come
[1:52:07] enough of what the devil has come to do
[1:52:10] I have come to
[1:52:13] to bring life to give life
[1:52:16] and that they might have it
[1:52:21] I am come that they might have life and
[1:52:24] that they might have it
[1:52:27] more abundantly
[1:52:29] you know that's not survival
[1:52:32] that's overcoming life
[1:52:34] that's not just barely getting by till
[1:52:37] Friday come on now that's living a
[1:52:40] Victorious Life the one that we sung
[1:52:43] about this morning that's echoing the
[1:52:46] authority of Christ that's echoing the
[1:52:50] victory of Christ how many of you want
[1:52:52] to live that kind of alive how many of
[1:52:54] you want to offer that kind of Praise of
[1:52:57] Praise that Echoes the authority of
[1:52:59] Christ a praise that Echoes the victory
[1:53:02] that we have in Christ it's ours
[1:53:05] because it's paid for by the blood so
[1:53:08] the enemy is constantly busy Desiring to
[1:53:13] cause death to our visions
[1:53:16] to our our dreams to our desires he's
[1:53:21] the greatest dream thief of them all
[1:53:25] when the Holy Spirit plants an
[1:53:28] inspiration in your life the enemy is
[1:53:31] always standing by to discourage you
[1:53:34] from it to destroy your faith in it and
[1:53:38] to cause you to give up somebody's got
[1:53:41] to hold on
[1:53:42] when everybody around you is giving up
[1:53:45] somebody has to take a hold of God's
[1:53:48] word and say I refuse
[1:53:51] to
[1:53:51] surrender one inch of ground
[1:53:55] I'm on a stand on this truth and I'm
[1:53:58] going to hold on to the promises of God
[1:54:03] his desire to cause death to ruin
[1:54:06] Visions to steal dreams to take hope to
[1:54:10] destroy our ability to stand in faith
[1:54:13] produces what we call death structures
[1:54:17] in our life I want us to look at slide
[1:54:20] 40 real quick we're going to go over
[1:54:22] these because we hit them very quickly
[1:54:24] at the end of a service death structures
[1:54:27] can be built over both individual lives
[1:54:32] and even whole congregations and
[1:54:35] Ministries
[1:54:37] you know sin is contagious
[1:54:41] if a church turns a deaf ear and a blind
[1:54:45] eye to divorce and remarriage
[1:54:49] the next thing you know it becomes a
[1:54:52] stronghold over a Congregation of people
[1:54:55] somebody's got to stand on the word
[1:54:57] if a church ignores what pornography is
[1:55:01] doing in marriages today never addresses
[1:55:05] it or even homosexuality and the things
[1:55:09] that are going on around us if it never
[1:55:11] gets addressed if holiness
[1:55:13] and modesty is never addressed
[1:55:18] the enemy will build a structure over a
[1:55:21] whole body that becomes a stronghold
[1:55:23] that will intimidate the preacher
[1:55:28] it's not they don't notice it it's that
[1:55:31] the enemy is there to raise an
[1:55:33] intimidation so that they won't even
[1:55:35] mention the things that matter to the
[1:55:38] heart of God and the scriptures are
[1:55:40] clear these things matter
[1:55:45] so we can't allow any stronghold any
[1:55:49] false Paradigm any death structure to
[1:55:53] keep us from the truth
[1:55:55] we have to keep fighting for the truth
[1:55:57] because it's ours
[1:55:59] amen
[1:56:00] so the enemy uh he's constantly trying
[1:56:05] to to build these structures over our
[1:56:09] lives our congregations our Ministries
[1:56:12] our region our state our nation
[1:56:16] in slide 41
[1:56:19] helps us to see whatever is not
[1:56:22] releasing or producing life it's a death
[1:56:27] structure
[1:56:28] if we get out of balance with law and
[1:56:31] Grace
[1:56:34] it produces a death structure
[1:56:37] come on if we get out of balance with
[1:56:40] the inward light and the outward light
[1:56:44] it produces a death structure if we get
[1:56:48] out of balance with sickness and healing
[1:56:50] and we start backing off our our faith
[1:56:54] and backing off what brother Greeley was
[1:56:56] releasing up here over us just a few
[1:56:58] minutes ago to just take I tell you what
[1:57:01] I was claiming my healing I was thinking
[1:57:04] about you too but there while we were
[1:57:07] worshiping earlier I was claiming my
[1:57:09] healing
[1:57:11] God showed me this week again and
[1:57:14] reminded me again that he is a Healer
[1:57:17] I left here Tuesday night not even
[1:57:20] knowing that I was about to have an
[1:57:22] attack in my foot and in the night
[1:57:24] Tuesday night and Wednesday morning an
[1:57:27] attack came on my foot and when I went
[1:57:30] to get up in the night I could hardly
[1:57:31] get to the bathroom couldn't put any
[1:57:34] weight on it at all by Wednesday midday
[1:57:37] I was on a walking stick and I had to
[1:57:39] put the weight on the stick and I mean
[1:57:42] it was swelling and it was hurting and
[1:57:45] we were supposed to go away for two days
[1:57:47] and I thought well I could put something
[1:57:49] on Facebook have all a privately and
[1:57:52] have all the church people praying but
[1:57:54] all of a sudden I had this inspiration
[1:57:56] that I would just reach out to the young
[1:57:59] people and I want you to know I depend
[1:58:02] on the older people's prayers I live by
[1:58:04] them so this wasn't any anyway any
[1:58:07] segregation or or Prejudice but it was
[1:58:10] just inspired I said I don't want
[1:58:13] everybody to know I'm struggling like
[1:58:15] this so I'm just going to reach out to
[1:58:16] the young people and I want you to know
[1:58:19] they begin immediately to say we're
[1:58:21] praying Pastor we're praying I don't
[1:58:23] know if everybody prayed that said they
[1:58:25] were praying but somebody prayed and
[1:58:29] somebody touched the Lord
[1:58:32] because when I woke up Thursday morning
[1:58:35] I had no pain in my foot whatsoever
[1:58:42] I put the cane in the vehicle just in
[1:58:45] case but I never even took it out of the
[1:58:47] vehicle while I was away
[1:58:49] and not only that I went down 310 steps
[1:58:53] and walked up 310 steps
[1:58:57] and Hike that day four and a half miles
[1:59:00] on my tracker
[1:59:02] for somebody that couldn't even walk
[1:59:04] hardly the day before you know that was
[1:59:07] faith that was touching God that was
[1:59:11] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:59:14] and forever
[1:59:17] vitamin C can't do that
[1:59:20] supplements can't do that
[1:59:23] it takes a long time for that stuff to
[1:59:26] get in your system and I highly
[1:59:28] recommend you supplementing vitamins and
[1:59:31] minerals I don't want you to think I
[1:59:33] don't but anybody who's ever done those
[1:59:35] things knows it takes a while for that
[1:59:37] to build your levels up no
[1:59:40] but when God does it
[1:59:43] whoa he can like Michael said he doesn't
[1:59:47] always heal us instantly but he can
[1:59:51] and he did
[1:59:52] and I'm claiming all that I have need of
[1:59:55] and I hope you will take advantage of an
[1:59:58] atmosphere like we had this morning
[2:00:01] to take that claim stake your claim tell
[2:00:05] the enemy that you refuse to let go of
[2:00:08] the promises of God so when we keep
[2:00:11] revisiting over and over those things
[2:00:15] that bring us back to doubt and death
[2:00:21] the thoughts
[2:00:23] the accusations the suppositions that
[2:00:27] keep bringing us back to doubt and death
[2:00:30] when we keep revisiting those things
[2:00:33] ignoring the fact that the that the Mind
[2:00:36] conversation never turns out well
[2:00:39] it always turns out negative it always
[2:00:43] turns out anointing your doubt instead
[2:00:45] of your faith so we have to recognize I
[2:00:47] got to stay out of that place let me
[2:00:49] give you Romans 7 5 again real quick
[2:00:52] slide 42 when we were living in the
[2:00:55] flesh mere physical lives the sinful
[2:00:59] passions that were awakened and aroused
[2:01:01] us up excuse me and aroused up by what
[2:01:06] the law makes sin we're constantly
[2:01:09] operating in our natural powers in our
[2:01:12] bodily organs in the sensitive appetites
[2:01:15] and wills of the flesh so that we bore
[2:01:18] fruit for death
[2:01:19] now as Sinners it is expected that we
[2:01:24] Bear death fruit
[2:01:25] but as Believers it's a trick of the
[2:01:28] enemy to cause us to be to be passing
[2:01:31] out death fruit
[2:01:32] Our Testimony our lifestyle even the way
[2:01:37] we worship is supposed to be like giving
[2:01:39] somebody Juicy Fruit
[2:01:42] come on fruit that's healing fruit
[2:01:46] that's liberating and there's delivering
[2:01:48] power in it not death and depression
[2:01:52] Webster's Dictionary
[2:01:55] defines a structure as the manner of
[2:01:59] which something is constructed as a
[2:02:03] building or a bridge a framework so when
[2:02:06] we use the term death structure then it
[2:02:10] helps us to see it's the enemy building
[2:02:12] a framework over our lives board by
[2:02:16] board piece by piece nail by nail until
[2:02:20] he can climb up on the top of it and
[2:02:22] Lord over our emotions
[2:02:25] Lord over our thoughts how many of you
[2:02:29] know we will if you let him but we're
[2:02:31] taking him down
[2:02:34] we're taking him down and we're taking
[2:02:37] his structure down
[2:02:39] we're taking his platform out from under
[2:02:42] him
[2:02:43] because we don't want to have have we
[2:02:45] don't want him to even have a place to
[2:02:47] stand second Corinthians 3 and 6 in the
[2:02:52] Amplified said it is he
[2:02:55] who has qualified US making us to be fit
[2:03:01] and what Worthy
[2:03:05] and what
[2:03:07] as ministers and dispensers of a New
[2:03:11] Covenant of Salvation through Christ not
[2:03:14] Ministers of the letter of Legally
[2:03:17] written code
[2:03:21] but of the spirit
[2:03:23] for the code of the law
[2:03:26] kills but the Holy Spirit does what
[2:03:30] it makes alive so we just say by the
[2:03:34] grace of God we want to tear down every
[2:03:36] structure structure of death
[2:03:39] it's clear that if we are led by the law
[2:03:42] the doctrines of men religious systems
[2:03:45] or even Traditions that make the word of
[2:03:48] God none effective we're going to
[2:03:50] experience More Death than we are life
[2:03:53] if we as individuals are corporately in
[2:03:57] our churches begin to build our faith on
[2:04:00] either of these foundations rather than
[2:04:03] the pure truth of God's word as revealed
[2:04:06] by the Holy Spirit we will be caught up
[2:04:08] in structures that tend to produce death
[2:04:12] and not life it is going to be
[2:04:15] imperative that we who are a part of the
[2:04:17] remnant bride must actively seek with
[2:04:20] discernment to overthrow all of the
[2:04:24] death structures in our lives and in our
[2:04:27] churches
[2:04:29] and in our church
[2:04:31] slide 45 God has an established
[2:04:35] framework that we must hang Our Lives
[2:04:38] upon and that one is built on the
[2:04:41] foundation of the Apostles and the
[2:04:43] prophets it is the holy word of God
[2:04:47] Ephesians 2 21 and 22 I read this to you
[2:04:52] already let me share it again in him the
[2:04:55] whole structure
[2:04:57] this is the structure we want to be a
[2:04:59] part of it's joined bound welded
[2:05:03] together harmoniously
[2:05:07] now let me talk to you just a minute
[2:05:09] about Harmony was someone talking to us
[2:05:12] recently about Harmony
[2:05:14] who was that
[2:05:16] somebody was that brother Dwayne yeah it
[2:05:18] was he was talking about Harmony let me
[2:05:21] tell you something about Harmony Harmony
[2:05:23] is not everybody singing the same note
[2:05:29] there's a lot of good singers there's a
[2:05:31] lot of groups that can sing but I notice
[2:05:34] that a lot of times they're all singing
[2:05:35] the same note
[2:05:37] that gets old with me in a hurry
[2:05:40] that's singing in unison
[2:05:43] singing the same word and the same note
[2:05:45] that's not Harmony
[2:05:47] I want you to know God is after Harmony
[2:05:49] he's not after uniformity
[2:05:53] he's after Harmony and Harmony is
[2:05:56] everyone singing a note that complements
[2:06:00] the other note
[2:06:01] and it starts building one voice upon
[2:06:04] another voice upon another voice and it
[2:06:07] Blends together to make a harmonious
[2:06:11] sound
[2:06:12] that's almost one voice but so full that
[2:06:18] one Voice couldn't possibly make such a
[2:06:20] full note
[2:06:21] you hear musicians sometimes bragging
[2:06:25] about family Harmony
[2:06:27] now I'm sorry to tell you every family
[2:06:29] doesn't have family Harmony
[2:06:33] I know there are people who think every
[2:06:35] African-American person can sing
[2:06:38] that's kind of a Prejudice thing or some
[2:06:41] kind of what do you call it a stereotype
[2:06:43] but that's not true I met some That
[2:06:46] Couldn't and it's possible to be in a
[2:06:49] family where everybody sings but you
[2:06:51] now you can break that and claim it you
[2:06:55] can ask the Lord to give you a voice but
[2:06:57] if you get a few from one family who
[2:07:00] have a gift of song and you lay their
[2:07:04] voices together there is no Harmony any
[2:07:06] sweeter in all the world than family
[2:07:09] Harmony When God's people begin to
[2:07:12] release the right note
[2:07:15] I'm preaching I need some help when
[2:07:18] God's people begin to release
[2:07:21] not sit in the corner with their arms
[2:07:23] folded like some bullfrog who swallowed
[2:07:26] buckshot
[2:07:29] not like somebody's sucking on a
[2:07:32] persimmon
[2:07:33] not somebody who drank pickle juice with
[2:07:36] their Corn Flakes
[2:07:39] but somebody that's found the joy of the
[2:07:41] Lord
[2:07:42] the joy of the Lord is my
[2:07:47] strength
[2:07:49] it's what I it's what gives me the
[2:07:51] strength to keep moving on it's when he
[2:07:54] releases a bubble of Joy a joy bubble
[2:07:57] down into the inside of the inside of
[2:08:01] the inside catch up now some of you are
[2:08:03] offended because I told you you might
[2:08:05] not be able to sing
[2:08:06] foreign
[2:08:10] why don't you forgive me and just come
[2:08:12] on back let's listen what I tell people
[2:08:14] everybody can sing in the shower
[2:08:19] let's get in the shower shut the door
[2:08:24] sing your heart out
[2:08:26] your family may be in the other room
[2:08:28] doing like this
[2:08:30] but your papa
[2:08:35] is looking over the balcony of Heaven
[2:08:37] saying to the angels listen up my boy
[2:08:40] singing for me
[2:08:43] it doesn't have to be beautiful to be
[2:08:45] unto God
[2:08:47] you just let out a song to him
[2:08:50] and it's always pleasing in his ear
[2:08:54] so you all forgive me now
[2:08:55] can we catch up and move on
[2:08:58] the Lord give me a an experience one
[2:09:01] time I don't want to go too deep into it
[2:09:04] because it seems nearly impossible that
[2:09:08] it could be played out the way that I
[2:09:11] saw it
[2:09:12] oftentimes we see things with the
[2:09:16] characters that we are presently with it
[2:09:20] does not necessarily mean we'll always
[2:09:23] be with the same characters people die
[2:09:26] people go on to other things people walk
[2:09:29] into fellowship and they walk out of
[2:09:30] fellowship and so I think the Lord was
[2:09:33] saying something more much higher to me
[2:09:36] in this than who was actually involved
[2:09:38] but but what was happening was I I we
[2:09:42] were standing together uh some Ministry
[2:09:46] friends of ours my wife and I were
[2:09:49] standing together with them and
[2:09:52] strangely enough I don't think I could
[2:09:55] put my hand on the little toy but
[2:09:57] brother Kevin heard me tell them this
[2:09:59] and he went on eBay and bought me one of
[2:10:01] the toys
[2:10:03] because it reminded me of a toy that I
[2:10:06] played with when I was a child how many
[2:10:08] of you remember those little pianos that
[2:10:11] you press the button and they had these
[2:10:13] little creature little singers they were
[2:10:15] happy looking happy looking elves or
[2:10:18] something you know I don't know not
[2:10:20] anything hideous but they had little
[2:10:22] heads that stuck up on the piano when
[2:10:25] I'm describing it sounds creepy
[2:10:28] but it wasn't creepy at all I'd have to
[2:10:30] get it out and show it to you it had
[2:10:32] little heads and when you press one
[2:10:34] button that one of the mouse would open
[2:10:37] up ah
[2:10:40] and you're president of all
[2:10:44] it'd make little sounds
[2:10:46] and this is was the experience that I
[2:10:49] saw in the spirit we were standing in
[2:10:51] Heavenly places and every single voice
[2:10:55] the sound of that voice
[2:10:58] because every person that's born again
[2:11:00] of the spirit is given a sound in the
[2:11:04] spirit
[2:11:06] so I don't want you to be making fun
[2:11:09] of someone sound
[2:11:13] be very careful
[2:11:15] when the spirit of God starts moving
[2:11:17] some people say whoa
[2:11:21] leave them
[2:11:23] leave them
[2:11:25] some people say ciao
[2:11:28] leave them be careful I hear we find it
[2:11:32] so easy to kind of make fun of people
[2:11:34] like that
[2:11:35] little sister Craighead when she wrote
[2:11:37] the song My theophy and when she sung it
[2:11:40] she she had a note she would hit and
[2:11:42] every time she hit that note in the song
[2:11:44] her shoe and foot would go she go oh
[2:11:49] that was her sound I'm not making fun of
[2:11:51] her sound
[2:11:52] I'm telling you it was her anybody know
[2:11:55] what brother Shaw's sound is
[2:12:04] we honor you
[2:12:07] we're not making fun of you we honor you
[2:12:09] hey hey
[2:12:14] you don't know what happens when
[2:12:18] somebody discovers their reaction to the
[2:12:22] spirit
[2:12:25] I don't make fun of people's motions
[2:12:28] with their hands because we have called
[2:12:32] angels to attention
[2:12:35] by the way
[2:12:37] by the way we move our hands
[2:12:41] or by a sound that comes out of our
[2:12:44] mouth oh if you've never been caught up
[2:12:48] into the Heavenly places you can't
[2:12:51] imagine how it moves but it moves to a
[2:12:55] different it's the atmosphere is not the
[2:12:58] same and the way things are done prayer
[2:13:01] doesn't even look the same in the spirit
[2:13:04] as it looks in the natural
[2:13:07] we were traveling with brother
[2:13:11] what's his name
[2:13:13] the black brother who saw Aaron Evans
[2:13:17] who Jesus appeared to him
[2:13:20] in the jail cell where he was put there
[2:13:23] for murder
[2:13:25] and Jesus appeared to him in that
[2:13:28] prison sailing
[2:13:30] and said to him hey
[2:13:32] I'm not a white man and I'm not a black
[2:13:36] man but I'm the right man you better
[2:13:38] fall down on your knees and worship me
[2:13:41] that was his testimony someone said I
[2:13:44] don't believe that happened well all I
[2:13:46] know is his life
[2:13:47] the fruit of the thing ought to show it
[2:13:49] his life turned around he came off of
[2:13:53] prison and out of death row and whatever
[2:13:55] else he was bound by and began to go
[2:13:57] across the world and preach the gospel
[2:13:59] so somebody showed up
[2:14:04] and we traveled with him a little while
[2:14:05] we were out in the tri-states of
[2:14:07] Washington in a meeting and uh Jill
[2:14:10] Maria's wife when the spirit of God
[2:14:12] would move she'd say how
[2:14:15] h o
[2:14:17] I'm not going to make fun of that
[2:14:20] because in this experience everybody had
[2:14:23] a sound
[2:14:25] and Josiah when when I released a sound
[2:14:28] in this experience I saw a certain
[2:14:32] division or kind of angel
[2:14:37] raise up
[2:14:39] to stand at attention
[2:14:41] and when that's
[2:14:44] [Music]
[2:14:46] and when that sound stopped I didn't
[2:14:49] stop it it just stopped I saw those
[2:14:51] angels
[2:14:53] shrink back to their place
[2:14:55] my wife was standing with me in this
[2:14:58] experience and she released the sound
[2:15:01] and I saw another type
[2:15:04] another ranking
[2:15:06] of angels when that sound began to come
[2:15:09] out of her mouth and she threw her head
[2:15:12] back like that like a wild woman and
[2:15:14] that sound began to come out of her
[2:15:16] mouth I saw this entirely different I
[2:15:18] don't want to say race but rank or kind
[2:15:20] or or or or a division of angels they
[2:15:23] raised up in brother they were ready
[2:15:26] and when that sound stopped out of her
[2:15:29] mouth they just folded right back into
[2:15:30] their place
[2:15:32] just a very reverent stand and the two
[2:15:34] other individuals that were with us as
[2:15:36] each of them began to release their
[2:15:38] sound they called up an entirely
[2:15:40] different there wasn't one of those four
[2:15:42] voices that caused the same kind of
[2:15:45] angel or rank or or description of Angel
[2:15:48] to come to attention
[2:15:51] not one in the same but all four caused
[2:15:55] a different kind to raise up
[2:15:58] and when I describe that to Kevin he he
[2:16:01] he opened up those little gifts opened
[2:16:04] up the little mouths and put pictures
[2:16:06] there
[2:16:08] for me to remember
[2:16:10] about the sound and each one had a sound
[2:16:13] one of the pictures he placed there was
[2:16:15] brother green because brother green
[2:16:17] certainly had a voice in my life and I
[2:16:20] honor him for that and there were others
[2:16:22] there you if you made your little piano
[2:16:25] you you would know a voices that have
[2:16:28] had a a place in your aren't you
[2:16:30] thankful I know we're just kind of
[2:16:32] talking this morning aren't you thankful
[2:16:34] for every voice that God has used along
[2:16:36] the way
[2:16:38] there may be some that you wouldn't go
[2:16:40] back and seek out to hear their voice
[2:16:43] again because their time in your life
[2:16:46] has expired and you have moved on but
[2:16:49] that doesn't mean that you shouldn't
[2:16:51] honor the times that God used that
[2:16:55] individual to speak into your life this
[2:16:59] is how the kingdom operates
[2:17:02] Church says they're not with us anymore
[2:17:04] so nothing they ever said or did matters
[2:17:09] no some of you are holding on to dreams
[2:17:13] that were interpreted for you and
[2:17:15] prophecies that were given to you by
[2:17:17] people that we no longer walk in
[2:17:19] fellowship with don't throw the baby out
[2:17:22] with the bath water don't get rid of the
[2:17:25] Cherry Pie because you found a pit
[2:17:28] and for whatever say for for for all
[2:17:31] that's good please don't get rid of the
[2:17:34] fried chicken
[2:17:36] because you hit a bone
[2:17:38] you take the bone out
[2:17:46] so God uses these people
[2:17:49] but let me tell you this I didn't mean
[2:17:51] to take this much time I should have
[2:17:52] read it if I was going to take this much
[2:17:53] time I could have read you the
[2:17:55] description of the experience but all of
[2:17:57] a sudden
[2:17:58] all four of us
[2:18:00] begin to let out our sound
[2:18:03] now when I heard those four individual
[2:18:05] sounds they didn't sound anything alike
[2:18:08] very unique very distinct very different
[2:18:10] tones but all of a sudden God began to
[2:18:13] use us like puppets and he began to let
[2:18:16] that Roar that sound begin to come out
[2:18:19] of all four of our mouths and brother
[2:18:22] when when that happened it made Harmony
[2:18:27] just like it makes in here come on now
[2:18:30] I want to say one more time I know
[2:18:32] everybody don't get the flag waving
[2:18:36] even though it's all through the Bible
[2:18:40] somebody said where'd that come from the
[2:18:42] Bible have you got time
[2:18:44] there's over 40 places
[2:18:47] see but if you're not used to that then
[2:18:50] you you might you might it might be
[2:18:52] easier for you to be critical than to
[2:18:53] investigate
[2:18:55] but I'm the kind of person I want to
[2:18:57] investigate and see what it's all about
[2:19:00] so everybody's not a flag waiver
[2:19:03] everybody's not a dancer everybody's not
[2:19:05] a
[2:19:07] what was brother Shaw's
[2:19:12] some of you go to bed at night you can
[2:19:14] hear it
[2:19:17] everybody don't do this
[2:19:19] but oh what Harmony I begin to hear as
[2:19:22] those four very unique sounds out of our
[2:19:25] four mouths begin to blend and this is
[2:19:27] the truth if I've ever told it I saw a
[2:19:30] kind of Angel raise up from the midst of
[2:19:32] that choir what looked like a choir of
[2:19:34] angels I saw a a a a a division a kind a
[2:19:38] race of angels to raise up like I had
[2:19:41] never in my life seen before and I
[2:19:44] screamed out oh
[2:19:47] in my experience in the room I cried out
[2:19:51] oh even though in the heavenlies the
[2:19:54] sound was still being played through me
[2:19:56] and I said I don't know any way to
[2:19:58] describe them except terrible
[2:20:01] they were terrible
[2:20:03] in the King James version sense of the
[2:20:06] word I am telling you they were the
[2:20:08] mightiest Warriors
[2:20:10] that I had ever seen in my life and I
[2:20:13] knew that they were ready brother to do
[2:20:16] the king's business
[2:20:18] there was a wildness Oh I don't believe
[2:20:21] there's any wild worry
[2:20:24] you ought to see the ones that go before
[2:20:26] me sometime when I get myself in trouble
[2:20:28] and they have to go fight for me
[2:20:31] they're pretty bad to the bone
[2:20:33] themselves and by women but I want you
[2:20:36] to know these raised up with surgery I
[2:20:39] knew they were ready to take off the
[2:20:41] devils
[2:20:46] and as soon as that sound ceased from
[2:20:49] coming out of our mouths I saw those
[2:20:51] huge Angels they raised up bigger taller
[2:20:53] brighter than all the others and I saw
[2:20:56] them just kind of fall back into play
[2:20:58] God was teaching me something
[2:21:00] he was teaching me that every Angel is
[2:21:02] not the same there are different kinds
[2:21:05] of ranks and divisions of Angels the
[2:21:07] Bible tells us there are different
[2:21:09] principalities and powers and if their
[2:21:12] spiritual wickedness if there's Variety
[2:21:14] in spiritual wickedness in high places
[2:21:16] there is variety
[2:21:19] in righteousness in high places remember
[2:21:22] anything the enemy is doing over here in
[2:21:25] darkness he is copying
[2:21:28] he is imitating what he has experienced
[2:21:32] over here in the light you understand
[2:21:34] that don't you and so it's a lot bigger
[2:21:37] than what we realize
[2:21:38] and I learned in that moment that
[2:21:40] there's nothing like the harmony that is
[2:21:43] formed when God calls people to stand
[2:21:46] together in a particular hour
[2:21:50] for a particular cause for a particular
[2:21:53] purpose and what if I told you we're at
[2:21:55] that moment
[2:22:00] we're there
[2:22:02] we're there
[2:22:04] now when I left here Tuesday night was a
[2:22:06] week ago
[2:22:07] after speaking 10 to 20 minutes
[2:22:11] on the standard of this church
[2:22:14] and I spoke especially to new newer ones
[2:22:19] who might not know how we have done
[2:22:22] things
[2:22:23] there were those who were not here
[2:22:26] if you if you do if you were not here
[2:22:29] you're taking anything you hear
[2:22:31] second-handed
[2:22:33] because no one would intentionally
[2:22:35] misrepresent something that I have said
[2:22:39] but they might do that and if Leviathan
[2:22:42] raised his ugly head
[2:22:45] he knows how to twist it
[2:22:47] to the hearer
[2:22:49] you better be on that twisting serpent
[2:22:52] you better watch how he operates
[2:22:56] to twist to try to cause you to get your
[2:23:00] little feelings hurt so that you reject
[2:23:03] the truth of the word that's how he
[2:23:05] operates isn't it you've watched him we
[2:23:08] play we play that game
[2:23:11] we played it not too long ago on a
[2:23:13] Saturday night at Luke and Megan's and
[2:23:16] it'll crack you up
[2:23:18] somebody Whispers something in the ear
[2:23:20] of one but they got to do it very very
[2:23:22] quietly
[2:23:24] where you can hardly hear them so you
[2:23:27] repeat what you think they said
[2:23:29] and then it got all around the room how
[2:23:31] many of you were there some of you a lot
[2:23:32] of you okay good your Witnesses and the
[2:23:35] next thing you know when it got all the
[2:23:37] way around the room you could it was
[2:23:40] it was nothing sometimes not even the
[2:23:42] same words sometimes the words that were
[2:23:44] used in the beginning were never even
[2:23:45] showed up in the end results that's just
[2:23:48] human error but you get a spirit behind
[2:23:51] it trying to twist things
[2:23:53] so I knew I knew when I left here that
[2:23:56] Tuesday night that the enemy was mad
[2:24:00] and I anticipated an ugliness
[2:24:04] and he produced One
[2:24:06] but he was defeated
[2:24:08] and he is defeated and I'm here today
[2:24:12] not backing up one half an inch
[2:24:16] because when I went to bed I felt like
[2:24:19] I'd been beat up
[2:24:21] kind of like last Sunday night when I
[2:24:23] went home and went to bed I felt like
[2:24:25] I'd been spiritually abused beat up
[2:24:27] it'll wear you out
[2:24:30] and so I felt that way that Tuesday
[2:24:32] night but he came
[2:24:34] and he came in such a sweet way that I
[2:24:38] told my family I said he he said I said
[2:24:42] he said we did the right thing
[2:24:46] so when the little twists and concerns
[2:24:48] begin to come and things got a little
[2:24:50] out of whack I realized that that was
[2:24:53] nothing but confirmation to the fact
[2:24:56] that he said listen I'm not working for
[2:24:58] you
[2:25:01] I love you
[2:25:03] I'm fighting with you but I don't work
[2:25:06] for you
[2:25:07] I work for him
[2:25:09] and when he told me it was all right
[2:25:12] and he said because of that you were
[2:25:15] about to go to a higher level
[2:25:18] as a body
[2:25:20] he said I'm going to raise you up to a
[2:25:22] higher level
[2:25:24] as a body and I told my family the next
[2:25:27] day or the next I said he's he's going
[2:25:29] to raise us up
[2:25:30] and we're not going to badge on holiness
[2:25:35] we're going to stand right there on that
[2:25:36] line because he's going to raise us up
[2:25:39] honey what night was it do you remember
[2:25:41] what night it was that I asked you it
[2:25:43] was a few nights after that that the
[2:25:45] Lord came in the bedroom again while we
[2:25:47] were sleeping the Lord came he came so
[2:25:50] preciously and raised up the bed
[2:25:56] got nothing good that's why you don't
[2:25:58] ever have them
[2:26:02] brother Madam said so he said you know
[2:26:04] why people don't see Angels they don't
[2:26:06] believe in them
[2:26:09] well I choose to believe in them and
[2:26:11] they come
[2:26:12] I believe in spiritual experience my
[2:26:15] faith is not built on that it's built on
[2:26:19] the land but he confirms his word
[2:26:23] still today
[2:26:24] in our lives you remember what night it
[2:26:27] was
[2:26:30] it might have been Saturday no no no no
[2:26:31] no I think it was Sunday night
[2:26:33] I think it might have been Sunday night
[2:26:35] well we went to bed Sunday night so
[2:26:37] early Monday morning or it could have
[2:26:39] been Saturday honey I don't it might
[2:26:41] have been Saturday
[2:26:42] the spirit of the Lord came in
[2:26:45] and he lifted the bed
[2:26:49] and not only did he lift the bed he
[2:26:51] Lifted Me
[2:26:53] and I tell you I I'm old now and I have
[2:26:56] a lot between between here and here
[2:26:59] and I don't I can't just sit straight up
[2:27:01] in the bed no more I have to roll out of
[2:27:02] the bed because of my sciatic and so
[2:27:05] when I go to get up I just turn out of
[2:27:06] the bed like that with my leg I don't
[2:27:09] know how long I've been late wind in the
[2:27:11] world I've been laying flat on the bed
[2:27:12] and sat straight up
[2:27:14] I know I didn't do that in my own
[2:27:16] strength
[2:27:17] I know he did that for me when I came to
[2:27:20] when I woke up when I came out of that
[2:27:22] experience I was sitting up in the bed
[2:27:24] like someone had set me up in the bed
[2:27:27] and I looked and the bed was lifted up
[2:27:29] off the floor
[2:27:31] and the Lord confirmed to me he said I
[2:27:33] told you I was Raising you all up
[2:27:36] raising you up raising that place up
[2:27:39] to a higher level
[2:27:41] I'm here to confirm that
[2:27:43] it's a confirmation
[2:27:46] somebody said well
[2:27:48] what does it mean it means we're going
[2:27:50] to higher places in his word
[2:27:54] it means he wants to heal our bodies and
[2:27:57] Deliver Us from oppression it means he
[2:28:01] wants to save our lost families
[2:28:03] [Music]
[2:28:05] he wants to give us souls for our labor
[2:28:10] he wants to deliver those who need
[2:28:13] Deliverance
[2:28:15] we don't have to stay down here
[2:28:18] there's a voice that says come up higher
[2:28:22] I want to show you something
[2:28:25] [Applause]
[2:28:30] give him praise
[2:28:37] and I wasn't going to share all that
[2:28:38] this morning
[2:28:45] I believe it was Saturday night
[2:28:50] a week ago last night I believe
[2:28:53] because I wanted to share it Sunday
[2:28:55] and when I woke up the Lord had given me
[2:28:58] something else to share remember before
[2:29:00] brother Dwayne came
[2:29:01] so I didn't share it now I believe it's
[2:29:03] the right time
[2:29:04] how many of you believe God
[2:29:06] never makes a mistake
[2:29:09] he's always right on time are you still
[2:29:11] with me
[2:29:12] this isn't a vote of confidence for me
[2:29:14] honey I'm not we're not voting
[2:29:16] this is to show you that God is more
[2:29:19] he's alive and well
[2:29:21] oh he's alive and well my wife woke up
[2:29:25] she raised up she looked over she went
[2:29:28] right back to sleep I asked her the next
[2:29:30] day honey did you realize that the bed
[2:29:32] when you woke up like that did you
[2:29:33] realize the bed wasn't even sitting on
[2:29:35] the floor She said
[2:29:36] she just kind of turned red she said no
[2:29:38] I didn't even realize it I so wish that
[2:29:40] I'd you don't know in those moments when
[2:29:43] the presence of God's so real I didn't
[2:29:44] know whether to poke her or not
[2:29:46] you don't want to scare somebody
[2:29:49] she has lived through some real things
[2:29:53] I'm telling you
[2:29:55] she's lived through some real
[2:29:57] experiences
[2:29:59] I'm glad
[2:30:01] to have her
[2:30:03] it didn't bother me that she didn't
[2:30:04] maybe recognize what was going on all of
[2:30:08] that I shared all of that because of the
[2:30:10] scripture there
[2:30:12] in him the whole structure is joined
[2:30:14] bound welded together harmoniously
[2:30:19] may we come together in worship
[2:30:22] because remember that's that's
[2:30:24] I know people think we emphasize that
[2:30:27] that hour a little too much but remember
[2:30:30] that's what God showed us
[2:30:32] that sound that he gave me for a new
[2:30:35] building a building we're not in now
[2:30:37] remember that sound that he gave me in
[2:30:39] that moment was a sound that roared from
[2:30:41] worship and that created an atmosphere
[2:30:44] for The Living Word to walk in Among Us
[2:30:46] and when that Living Word is raised from
[2:30:49] the pages of history and becomes a
[2:30:51] living reality to a people of Faith he
[2:30:53] begins to do the very same thing today
[2:30:55] that he did yesterday and it's in that
[2:30:58] atmosphere that brother Branham said
[2:30:59] creative Miracles would be done and
[2:31:01] ananiasis and sapphirus would fall to
[2:31:03] the ground he said it
[2:31:07] missing limbs would be restored he said
[2:31:11] does anybody still believe
[2:31:15] that's what happens when people are
[2:31:17] working together harmoniously
[2:31:20] I don't care if you have to fight one
[2:31:22] another tooth and toenail in the natural
[2:31:25] whatever you do don't give up on each
[2:31:27] other
[2:31:31] don't give up on each other because we
[2:31:34] will not be able to create the sound
[2:31:36] that roused
[2:31:38] that group of warring angels like I've
[2:31:40] never seen before with missing sounds
[2:31:42] Among Us
[2:31:43] it'll take everyone that God has
[2:31:46] ordained to be here and you know why we
[2:31:48] haven't seen it yet because they all
[2:31:49] ain't got here yet
[2:31:52] they're not all here yet
[2:31:55] I'm prophesying to you now they are not
[2:31:59] all here yet
[2:32:01] but when they get here
[2:32:02] [Applause]
[2:32:04] we should have some of our backyard
[2:32:07] scraps all worked out
[2:32:12] families fight
[2:32:15] they fall out
[2:32:17] they have some difficulty brother
[2:32:20] Branham said
[2:32:21] but we do that scrapping in the backyard
[2:32:25] when we come around to the front yard
[2:32:28] we're all branhams
[2:32:31] that's what he said my brothers
[2:32:33] we get around to the front yard and
[2:32:35] we'll fight you
[2:32:38] in the backyard we fight each other when
[2:32:40] we get to the front yard you better not
[2:32:42] cross us
[2:32:43] I'm just telling you what he's saying
[2:32:45] does anybody understand how that applies
[2:32:48] to the spiritual
[2:32:50] you see my flaws I see yours
[2:32:53] I may even share them and you might
[2:32:55] share mine with you and you might share
[2:32:58] with me but when we get into this
[2:33:00] atmosphere we're not here looking at
[2:33:02] each other's pimples
[2:33:05] we're not worried about somebody's
[2:33:07] crooked nose then
[2:33:10] everybody's got a flaw
[2:33:12] nobody's examining flabby underarms when
[2:33:15] you get in the spirit
[2:33:17] when we get in the spirit we see past
[2:33:20] all imperfection
[2:33:21] and we sing with sister Peterson oh
[2:33:24] praise the lord it's Jesus that I see
[2:33:28] let me tell you something I didn't see a
[2:33:31] bunch of carnality in this house when we
[2:33:35] were worshiping the Lord this morning
[2:33:37] I'm preaching to you
[2:33:39] what I saw was the Perfection of Christ
[2:33:43] resting on a body of believers
[2:33:47] who had laid their differences down
[2:33:51] so they might enter in to that with
[2:33:55] to that which is Beyond the Veil
[2:33:59] but we get out there we may you know you
[2:34:02] you volleyball I I want you to know I
[2:34:05] have come this close
[2:34:08] to outlawing volleyball
[2:34:12] somebody said you couldn't do it I did
[2:34:17] and I could again
[2:34:21] we used to time them
[2:34:23] and if I remember that Chad you do
[2:34:26] you have 45 minutes to play
[2:34:30] we're not going to wrap our lives up in
[2:34:32] things that are carnal
[2:34:37] we watched these these that are on up
[2:34:40] here now
[2:34:43] I see all these ladies in here with bare
[2:34:45] legs and I'm thinking to myself you'd
[2:34:47] have had a tough time way back when
[2:34:52] because we come through old school
[2:34:55] to get to where we are
[2:34:57] and if I thought that our Eternal
[2:34:59] destination was resting in that I'd
[2:35:01] preach it this morning
[2:35:04] the reason that I don't is because I
[2:35:06] don't think that's the case
[2:35:08] but there was a time that we measured
[2:35:10] them we give them a little while and the
[2:35:12] rest of the time we wanted to be
[2:35:14] spiritual entertainment and when I say
[2:35:15] entertainment I mean worship singing and
[2:35:18] talking about the things of God
[2:35:20] we didn't have as many young people then
[2:35:22] as we do now I don't think it was
[2:35:25] particularly related to that
[2:35:28] but every time I get aggravated at my
[2:35:32] own children
[2:35:33] not just yours
[2:35:35] for how competitive they can be
[2:35:41] smack talking they can be
[2:35:47] you see I
[2:35:49] I'm getting some support I hope he'll
[2:35:52] support me when I say what I'm going to
[2:35:53] say in a minute because I'm going to
[2:35:55] tell you why I don't stop it
[2:35:58] but uh
[2:36:00] I I get aggravated because I I wasn't I
[2:36:04] wasn't brought up in those things I
[2:36:06] never played ball I never did those kind
[2:36:08] of things so I couldn't really teach my
[2:36:11] boys how to do any of that because I
[2:36:13] didn't grow up doing it
[2:36:15] so most of their flaws like that I blame
[2:36:18] on Ben and Zach
[2:36:27] no don't you remember Chad was always my
[2:36:30] favorite I didn't blame him for nothing
[2:36:31] that's what they all said you know
[2:36:34] but but I guess if you're going to be
[2:36:36] fair here
[2:36:39] Chad taught them they're Fair of
[2:36:41] carnality there's fair share too
[2:36:44] but it was those boys that taught him
[2:36:47] how to catch a ball
[2:36:49] and hit a ball wasn't me
[2:36:53] they learned those things from one
[2:36:55] another and I think sometimes people
[2:36:57] forget
[2:36:58] that you've got to learn
[2:37:01] you're not born into the world knowing
[2:37:03] how to spike
[2:37:06] and if you didn't grow up in a spiky
[2:37:09] environment
[2:37:11] or a competitive environment you don't
[2:37:14] know those things and so I think what we
[2:37:17] really ought to do is say to them this
[2:37:20] yes when you play you should play to win
[2:37:25] or you you're not going to criticize
[2:37:27] that are you you're going to play to
[2:37:29] lose is that what you're going to teach
[2:37:31] them to go out there in the world with
[2:37:34] played loose no we're going to teach him
[2:37:37] to play to win
[2:37:39] we're going to tell them if you don't
[2:37:41] want to win and you don't want to play
[2:37:42] with to the best of your ability sit
[2:37:45] down and watch
[2:37:47] but if you're out there
[2:37:49] and you're not as good as somebody else
[2:37:53] there's nothing to help somebody rise
[2:37:57] oh I'm going to preach an hour on this
[2:38:00] there's nothing that helps someone rise
[2:38:03] and Thrive like giving them a little
[2:38:06] positive
[2:38:12] feedback
[2:38:13] whoo good try
[2:38:18] and I don't just mean to you boys who's
[2:38:20] trying to catch a girl's attention I've
[2:38:22] seen you all do that
[2:38:29] I've seen it I we're just oh you
[2:38:32] streamers just turn it off
[2:38:35] we're just taking care of family
[2:38:36] business this morning you won't get
[2:38:39] nothing out of this
[2:38:41] I don't mean that I mean sincere praise
[2:38:44] goes a long way
[2:38:46] and when it's over you pull them off to
[2:38:48] the side and you say now look you were
[2:38:50] not watching
[2:38:52] you you were not watching
[2:38:54] you've got to watch the ball if you
[2:38:55] don't go hit you in the face
[2:39:01] ain't that right
[2:39:08] I was talking to Felix because we were
[2:39:10] all praying for his eye
[2:39:13] it'll get you
[2:39:15] don't embarrass them and think they're
[2:39:18] going to thrive
[2:39:20] lift them up
[2:39:22] I'm preaching to you that are saying
[2:39:25] amen
[2:39:26] I'm preaching to you that are not take a
[2:39:29] little extra time give somebody an arm
[2:39:32] up
[2:39:33] one of these young girls learn that if
[2:39:36] if any girl can do it she can
[2:39:40] somebody said why don't you tell them if
[2:39:42] a boy can do it they can because I don't
[2:39:44] believe that so I'm not going to preach
[2:39:46] that
[2:39:48] I believe there are certain things that
[2:39:50] she ought not to want to do
[2:39:56] but if there's any girl anywhere that
[2:39:59] can do good at volleyball then every one
[2:40:02] of these girls can do good at volleyball
[2:40:04] with a little arm up and a hand up and a
[2:40:07] little praise a little less competition
[2:40:10] but every time I think I'm going to stop
[2:40:13] it
[2:40:14] the spirit of the Lord comes to me and
[2:40:15] says
[2:40:17] I'm telling you the truth now
[2:40:19] you don't have to believe me
[2:40:21] you'd be surprised what are you saying
[2:40:23] you'd be surprised what I can teach him
[2:40:30] you've got to learn to step on one
[2:40:33] another
[2:40:35] you've got to learn to get on each
[2:40:37] other's nerves and do it well
[2:40:42] you got to learn to take those more
[2:40:52] it takes us all
[2:40:55] it takes uncomely parts
[2:40:59] you can't all be a strong arm
[2:41:03] somebody has to be afoot
[2:41:05] some of you asked brother Billy how
[2:41:07] important the thumb is
[2:41:10] he found that out button into his shirt
[2:41:12] to come to church today there are
[2:41:13] certain things you need a thumb for
[2:41:16] we need each other
[2:41:19] we can't let anything out there cause us
[2:41:23] to treat each other different when we
[2:41:25] come in here
[2:41:27] we've got to learn from those kinds of
[2:41:30] environments
[2:41:33] I've been criticized for letting my boys
[2:41:36] play on a softball team I did it because
[2:41:39] I wanted them to learn something that I
[2:41:41] couldn't teach them
[2:41:44] you don't have to do the same
[2:41:46] I wanted them to learn what it is to be
[2:41:48] a part of a team because I wanted them
[2:41:51] to bring that kind of an attitude into a
[2:41:55] service
[2:41:57] I pray for these musicians every Sunday
[2:42:00] morning at 10 till because the gifts in
[2:42:03] their life are vital
[2:42:07] to create this harmonious
[2:42:10] building
[2:42:11] that God desires to build in this house
[2:42:14] so learn from your from your rubbing one
[2:42:19] iron
[2:42:24] but treat one another with dignity and
[2:42:27] respect
[2:42:29] but learn that iron
[2:42:32] sharpeneth iron
[2:42:34] you see some Sunday people come in there
[2:42:37] all chill
[2:42:38] and some Sunday they come to the
[2:42:40] volleyball court and they're worn out
[2:42:42] they're they're tired their nerves are
[2:42:44] frazzled
[2:42:45] and they act like little kindergartners
[2:42:48] and they've got children to raise
[2:42:52] but when they get out there they act
[2:42:54] like little preschoolers
[2:42:57] we learn from that
[2:43:02] we learn from that be the first
[2:43:05] to apologize
[2:43:07] let me give you some successful marriage
[2:43:09] advice
[2:43:11] be very quick
[2:43:13] to apologize
[2:43:16] so important don't wait till the next
[2:43:19] day don't wait till the next week when
[2:43:22] you know you haven't handled something
[2:43:23] properly you look her right in the
[2:43:26] eyeballs and you say I messed up and I'm
[2:43:29] asking you to forgive me but she's the
[2:43:32] wife and she's the woman and she's the
[2:43:34] weaker and so forth and Etc that's why
[2:43:37] it's even more powerful
[2:43:40] for the man to say I mess this up I want
[2:43:44] you to forgive me we learn so much in
[2:43:47] life if we if we're if we're teachable
[2:43:50] that will help transfer that will
[2:43:53] transfer into what God is calling this
[2:43:55] body to model
[2:43:58] he's building a family where there will
[2:44:01] be no big eyes and little use
[2:44:05] come on now and I don't want you
[2:44:07] apologizing for your family
[2:44:10] I want you to help build them into what
[2:44:13] God has created them to do build them
[2:44:17] model it in front of them live it in
[2:44:20] front of them
[2:44:22] show these children the right way I'd
[2:44:25] like to say to some of you parents who
[2:44:27] are training your children to to wear on
[2:44:30] your nerves so you'll take them out
[2:44:33] I'd like to say to some of you that you
[2:44:35] have to work with them at times
[2:44:37] and sometimes you have to do that you
[2:44:41] have to go out because you don't want to
[2:44:43] disturb a service but make sure that
[2:44:45] you're not training them
[2:44:48] you'll know the balance make sure that
[2:44:51] you're not training them to wiggle
[2:44:54] to talk a little louder
[2:44:57] so that you'll take them in there and
[2:44:58] feed them and you do you talk to your
[2:45:00] your girlfriends
[2:45:02] while they play on the floor
[2:45:04] did it get quiet
[2:45:10] you don't want to train them for that
[2:45:11] reason
[2:45:12] you don't want to do that you want to
[2:45:14] make sure that they understand that it's
[2:45:16] your goal your desire to be in here and
[2:45:19] to have them with you when you have to
[2:45:21] take them out you do that and don't you
[2:45:23] think that anybody's going to criticize
[2:45:24] you for that we're not going to do it
[2:45:26] but our church is growing some
[2:45:29] and we're going to need to use the
[2:45:30] nursing nursery for nursing
[2:45:33] I don't want any sister in here to have
[2:45:36] to go to the dirty bathroom no offense
[2:45:38] it's usually very clean sister Jennifer
[2:45:41] but I don't want anybody to have to go
[2:45:43] in the bathroom to nurse their baby
[2:45:45] we've got a large Nursery here the first
[2:45:47] nursery on the right that was dedicated
[2:45:50] for nursing mothers
[2:45:52] and we have gotten a little slack and
[2:45:54] we've used it for other things because
[2:45:55] we didn't have so many nursing babies
[2:45:57] but guess what
[2:45:59] we've got some and more on the way
[2:46:02] so we have to be flexible I'm preaching
[2:46:05] to you and we have to learn to shift a
[2:46:08] little bit because growth and progress
[2:46:11] and being built up is hard sometimes but
[2:46:15] we're building up structures that will
[2:46:17] produce life
[2:46:19] behave yourself out there
[2:46:21] so that when you come in here you can
[2:46:23] forgive
[2:46:24] and you're not holding anything against
[2:46:26] one another when you start building an
[2:46:28] atmosphere like we had today can you
[2:46:31] imagine
[2:46:32] can you imagine the presence of the Lord
[2:46:34] being so real
[2:46:37] that it physically took my breath I
[2:46:40] wasn't breathing and didn't know it
[2:46:46] and then I realized
[2:46:48] all of a sudden
[2:46:50] I may need a little air here
[2:46:52] and I went
[2:46:56] it was so real
[2:46:59] and so captivating
[2:47:02] I may have been surviving a few seconds
[2:47:05] on another atmosphere
[2:47:09] eventually I needed some oxygen from
[2:47:12] planet Earth
[2:47:13] I know we don't live by feeling but folk
[2:47:17] we're coming up
[2:47:18] [Music]
[2:47:21] enter into something that real
[2:47:23] we're getting above ourselves
[2:47:28] we're stretching out of our comfort
[2:47:30] zones
[2:47:32] you get in here and get all you can in
[2:47:34] him the whole structure is joy and bound
[2:47:36] welded together harmoniously and it
[2:47:38] continues to rise grow increase into a
[2:47:40] holy Temple in the Lord a sanctuary
[2:47:43] dedicated consecrated and sacred to the
[2:47:46] presence of the Lord this is the this is
[2:47:48] what I'm talking about here's the house
[2:47:51] in him
[2:47:53] and in Fellowship thank you Amplified
[2:47:57] in him and in fellowship with one
[2:48:00] another you yourselves also are being
[2:48:02] built up into this structure
[2:48:05] into this house with the rest to form a
[2:48:09] fixed Abode a Dwelling Place of God In
[2:48:11] by through the spirit Mark that down
[2:48:16] Mark Ephesians 2 21 22 in the Amplified
[2:48:21] Bible somebody take a picture of it
[2:48:24] get your phone out and take a picture of
[2:48:27] this
[2:48:29] zoom in
[2:48:35] get that verse when you're Googling over
[2:48:39] your baby pictures and looking at your
[2:48:41] vacation picture I want that to stare
[2:48:43] you in the face I want you to say this
[2:48:46] is what God is doing in me and through
[2:48:48] me I am a part of this structure I don't
[2:48:52] know if I'm a finger or a toe
[2:48:56] I don't know if I'm part of the arm or
[2:48:58] the leg
[2:48:59] I don't know if I'm an eye or an ear
[2:49:02] but I know I'm part of this body
[2:49:06] it's a spiritual body it's not a natural
[2:49:10] body
[2:49:11] slide 47. a death structure is created
[2:49:16] when the devil builds the foundation of
[2:49:18] past the pains the failures the
[2:49:21] disappointments and weaknesses of
[2:49:22] yesterday are you still with me
[2:49:25] good
[2:49:26] let me ask you a question has anybody
[2:49:29] had any any failure in your past
[2:49:32] any pain in your past any
[2:49:35] disappointments in your past any
[2:49:37] weaknesses in your past every one of us
[2:49:40] and the enemy wants to build on that
[2:49:42] place
[2:49:43] that's the foundation he uses the the
[2:49:46] Church of the Living God is built on the
[2:49:48] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[2:49:49] which is the Chief Cornerstone the Lord
[2:49:51] Jesus Christ
[2:49:52] but death structures are built on the
[2:49:54] foundation of past pain past failure
[2:49:57] past disappointment and past weaknesses
[2:50:01] he then attempts to establish a strategy
[2:50:04] that becomes a structure
[2:50:07] resulting
[2:50:09] in the abandonment or death of vision
[2:50:14] and abortion of Destiny Hope deferred
[2:50:18] we were drowning in debt
[2:50:23] we were in a situation where it is not
[2:50:27] likely
[2:50:28] that this property would have been paid
[2:50:30] off in my lifetime
[2:50:33] then what about the rest of the vision
[2:50:37] there's no room to stand on the rest of
[2:50:39] the vision when you can't pay for the
[2:50:41] last come on
[2:50:43] and God spoke to brother Greeley and
[2:50:45] said it's time to do something about it
[2:50:47] come on this is how it works
[2:50:50] that's that's that was his sound
[2:50:55] joining with with your sound
[2:50:58] to form a a a a a a a
[2:51:02] a coalition
[2:51:04] to get this thing done
[2:51:13] now we're we're moving out
[2:51:17] and we can talk about
[2:51:20] how God will make provision
[2:51:22] because he's shown us he can
[2:51:24] and he's shown us that he can
[2:51:26] if we're faithful to keep the vision in
[2:51:28] front of us that's what we needed
[2:51:30] brother Greely to do and many other
[2:51:31] things but that was one of the things
[2:51:33] that God used him for and he's using him
[2:51:35] for to keep that in front of us we got
[2:51:37] to get out from under this
[2:51:38] not so that we can't ever believe for
[2:51:40] something else
[2:51:42] but so that we don't have we're not
[2:51:44] drowning anymore
[2:51:45] how many of you know it's already shrunk
[2:51:47] to a place where we know we can do it
[2:51:50] well guess what we could do it when it
[2:51:51] wasn't we just had to make up our mind
[2:51:54] to do it so what happens is the enemy
[2:51:56] moves in on disappointments of the past
[2:51:58] and failures and pain and and weaknesses
[2:52:01] and he and he kills any hope any Vision
[2:52:05] Any Dream for the future
[2:52:08] and he calls his Destinies to be aborted
[2:52:11] I'm nearly done but I want your
[2:52:13] attention
[2:52:14] he caused his Destinies to be aborted
[2:52:19] and he used his hope deferred
[2:52:23] once a death structure is in place
[2:52:26] the enemy will seek to gain
[2:52:30] illegitimate Authority
[2:52:33] over a life
[2:52:35] he starts driving people around
[2:52:38] with their emotions
[2:52:41] they become angry they become jealous
[2:52:43] they become bitter
[2:52:45] not having to do with today having to do
[2:52:49] with a build up from yesterday come on
[2:52:51] we got to recognize that and tear it
[2:52:53] down
[2:52:54] there's one thing you need to know he's
[2:52:56] looking for control and authority over
[2:52:58] your life but here we are echoing the
[2:53:01] authority of Jesus Christ
[2:53:03] let me just tell you this if you ask the
[2:53:05] devil to dinner
[2:53:10] he'll come and bring a suitcase
[2:53:15] if you ever had a family member that you
[2:53:17] couldn't even invite to dinner because
[2:53:18] you knew they wouldn't know when to go
[2:53:20] home
[2:53:21] oh
[2:53:24] have you ever had an uncle you couldn't
[2:53:26] invite to come visit
[2:53:28] because you knew he'd come on a one-way
[2:53:30] ticket
[2:53:31] the devil is that kind of Uncle
[2:53:35] the devil is that kind of a family
[2:53:37] member you cannot invite the the enemy
[2:53:39] you can't invite the devil to come to
[2:53:41] your house and have tea with you or
[2:53:43] dinner with you and expect him not to
[2:53:45] bring his suitcase because any
[2:53:48] invitation to that kind of a spirit
[2:53:52] will cause him to come to stay
[2:53:57] and you don't want that
[2:53:59] in other words if you open any door
[2:54:02] he moves into Stage
[2:54:06] someone give me the reference for if you
[2:54:08] give the devil an inch he'll take a mile
[2:54:10] where is that found in the Bible
[2:54:13] someone want to look it up on your
[2:54:15] smartphone
[2:54:19] if you give the devil an inch you'll
[2:54:20] take a mile where's that found
[2:54:24] that's in Saint Stephen Shelley chapter
[2:54:26] 4 verse 1. it's not in the book
[2:54:30] that's what grandma said
[2:54:34] our granny said if you give that devil
[2:54:36] an inch he'll take them all
[2:54:38] the Bible did say give not space to the
[2:54:42] enemy
[2:54:43] don't give the devil's face don't give
[2:54:46] him a listen to me
[2:54:49] I'ma wait till I know you're listening
[2:54:52] don't give the enemy a place to work in
[2:54:56] your emotions
[2:55:00] don't take your offense
[2:55:03] from the volleyball court
[2:55:06] to your house
[2:55:10] leave it here
[2:55:15] hug one another
[2:55:17] man to me and go hug your brother
[2:55:21] sisters go hug one another
[2:55:26] you ruffled each other's feathers out
[2:55:28] there at the at the cornhole
[2:55:32] it's a good thing we got rid of brother
[2:55:34] Dwayne some of the rest of you all can
[2:55:36] win now
[2:55:44] I was just going on his bragging
[2:55:51] it's been needing
[2:55:55] needs it but Jesus needs him now
[2:56:00] they tell me he's good at it
[2:56:02] don't get your little feathers ruffled
[2:56:05] out there and take that home with you
[2:56:07] Dodge one another
[2:56:11] we're being built up
[2:56:13] called higher
[2:56:16] loosen your belt
[2:56:19] unbuckle it like brother Greely saw in
[2:56:22] the spirit let it fall off of you
[2:56:26] you don't want to carry that heavy load
[2:56:29] slide 50 Mark 3 27 I'm almost done in
[2:56:32] the Amplified
[2:56:34] no one can go into a strong man's house
[2:56:36] and ransack his household goods right
[2:56:38] and left and sees them as plunder
[2:56:41] unless he first binds the strong man
[2:56:43] then indeed he may thoroughly Ponder his
[2:56:46] house
[2:56:48] the enemy can't just March in your door
[2:56:53] mistreat your wife and steal your drink
[2:56:55] your Pepsi Cola
[2:57:00] if he gets embarrassed because you are
[2:57:02] not the strong man you are supposed to
[2:57:04] be in this hour
[2:57:07] oh you're just really condemning oh no
[2:57:10] I'm telling you now is your opportunity
[2:57:13] to seize the moment
[2:57:17] batting down the hatches and quitting
[2:57:19] like men and raise up and ask the Lord
[2:57:23] to strengthen you so that the enemy he
[2:57:26] may knock
[2:57:29] he may stand in the window and threaten
[2:57:32] and huff and blow huff and puff and blow
[2:57:36] your house down but you just tell him no
[2:57:39] no you're on the outside looking in I'd
[2:57:41] rather be on the inside looking out than
[2:57:43] to be on the outside looking in you want
[2:57:45] to be in here you load down dirty Thief
[2:57:48] but the blood of Jesus has piped this
[2:57:51] place
[2:57:52] you're not coming in here
[2:57:55] if the enemy can bind the strong man he
[2:57:58] will come in and thoroughly plunder your
[2:58:03] life he will steal your dreams
[2:58:09] he'll steal your children
[2:58:11] he'll steal your health
[2:58:14] he'll produce a death structure all
[2:58:16] around you where Everything You Touch
[2:58:18] fails
[2:58:20] look Folk
[2:58:22] if you don't pay your tithes when you
[2:58:24] have tithes to pay
[2:58:26] the Bible said you're cursed with a
[2:58:28] curse
[2:58:29] you have already invited trouble in
[2:58:36] somebody said I'd be embarrassed to put
[2:58:38] a dollar in because I made ten dollars
[2:58:40] is all I made this week I'd be
[2:58:42] embarrassed to put a dollar in I want
[2:58:43] you to know in order to stay in right
[2:58:46] standing with God I'd make my daughter
[2:58:48] we'll buy the envelope
[2:58:50] I'd make my Thai check out or I'd make
[2:58:53] I'd find my dollar bill or my four
[2:58:54] quarters and I'd put them an envelope
[2:58:56] and I'd say Lord this is you and this is
[2:58:58] what you this is all I made this week
[2:59:04] ten dollars so I'm giving you the dollar
[2:59:07] come on because you don't want to invite
[2:59:09] the devil in
[2:59:10] you want to be in right standing with
[2:59:13] God somebody say oh you're just
[2:59:15] preaching on giving not really
[2:59:17] not really because God has shown us that
[2:59:20] he can stretch
[2:59:21] he can make a way we borrowed a little
[2:59:24] money that I had stuck aside and hoping
[2:59:28] that we would use it for insurance and
[2:59:30] we had to use it to finish out the
[2:59:32] Jerusalem payment but we I didn't even
[2:59:34] get or I just did it
[2:59:38] I had tucked it there for insurance it
[2:59:40] wasn't designated Jerusalem I had tucked
[2:59:43] it there for insurance but when we were
[2:59:45] a little short for truth I just untucked
[2:59:47] it put it over there and knew that God
[2:59:50] would make a way it's a little
[2:59:51] embarrassing to have to get up here and
[2:59:54] tell you that there's a need
[2:59:56] but it's the only way to see the need
[2:59:58] man
[3:00:00] because it's the way God takes care of
[3:00:02] his business
[3:00:04] if you can't help then you can't help
[3:00:07] and don't be condemned
[3:00:10] do what God requires first and then be
[3:00:12] ready to help when you can help but give
[3:00:14] him what belongs to him can I get any
[3:00:17] amens
[3:00:18] you give him well I couldn't make out an
[3:00:20] envelope for 50 Cent why these children
[3:00:22] do
[3:00:29] 40 cent in an envelope it's God's
[3:00:32] don't leave it in your semi-some I'll
[3:00:34] leave it in my pocket until I get more
[3:00:36] to go with it to put it in that's not
[3:00:37] what he says
[3:00:41] he actually says bring your tithe into
[3:00:44] the storehouse
[3:00:46] so when you come into the storehouse if
[3:00:48] you've had a time if you've had some Eco
[3:00:50] you need to give that to God you need to
[3:00:52] tithe on that if it's just a few
[3:00:55] won't he bless you
[3:00:58] you don't even have to preach this
[3:01:00] you just have to be reminded from time
[3:01:02] to time because we all know
[3:01:05] and we know what kind of church we're
[3:01:06] sitting in
[3:01:08] in Luke 11 21-22 Jesus spoke of the
[3:01:11] strong man who is prepared and armed to
[3:01:13] keep his home and protect his
[3:01:15] possessions but warns us like he did in
[3:01:18] Mark of what happens when a stronger
[3:01:20] than he comes in and I can show you that
[3:01:22] it's there when a strong man armed
[3:01:24] keepeth his Palace his goods are in
[3:01:25] peace but when a stronger than he shall
[3:01:27] come upon him and overcome him he taketh
[3:01:29] from him all his armor wherein he
[3:01:31] trusted and divided dispose that's what
[3:01:33] the enemy would like to do for you can
[3:01:34] anybody tell the devil that he's
[3:01:36] defeated
[3:01:38] you're defeated
[3:01:41] you're defended
[3:01:45] I'm closing
[3:01:49] in a message Jesus Christ the same
[3:01:51] yesterday today and forever paragraph

[3:46:21] to
[3:46:23] the day of atonement Yom Kippur
[3:46:27] these are the days of repentance
[3:46:30] these are the days of scouring out
[3:46:34] for it was only one day of the year that
[3:46:37] the high priest of the older Covenant
[3:46:41] would enter in behind the veil and offer
[3:46:43] the blood
[3:46:45] upon The Mercy Seat of the Ark of the
[3:46:47] Covenant
[3:46:49] it was the only day that he was allowed
[3:46:51] in your presence
[3:46:54] As We Gather here Tuesday night we will
[3:46:56] be remembering that time
[3:46:58] but we are so thankful
[3:47:01] that you made a way
[3:47:04] for us to come behind the veil today
[3:47:08] and tomorrow
[3:47:10] and the next day and the next day and
[3:47:12] the next day
[3:47:14] nothing shuts us out
[3:47:17] but our own reluctance to come
[3:47:21] for we come not offering our own life as
[3:47:23] a witness but we come offering the
[3:47:26] Spotless blood of the Lamb
[3:47:32] the perfect and accepted sacrifice
[3:47:37] as we leave here today May the Holy
[3:47:39] Spirit seal in
[3:47:41] every touch
[3:47:43] I saw several receiving refillings of
[3:47:46] the Holy Ghost
[3:47:48] we have been praying for Jesse since he
[3:47:51] returned from this
[3:47:52] from the military service that you would
[3:47:55] stir up what you did for him before he
[3:47:58] left
[3:47:58] and we saw you doing that today and we
[3:48:01] give you the glory we give you the
[3:48:03] praise the honor belongs to the lamb
[3:48:07] and for every other person in this house
[3:48:10] that you minister to today we just want
[3:48:12] to say thank you Jesus
[3:48:16] thank you Jesus
[3:48:18] and we want to say you are truly worthy
[3:48:20] of it all
[3:48:23] we love you
[3:48:25] for from you are all things
[3:48:28] and who you are all things
[3:48:37] you're dismissed to go in the name of
[3:48:39] Jesus you are worthy of it all
[3:48:43] foreign

[3:48:51] we'll have an afternoon of food and
[3:48:53] fellowship come and be with us
[3:48:56] [Music]
[3:49:29] and you are all things oh you deserve
[3:49:35] the glory
[3:49:40] is
[3:49:41] [Music]
[3:49:48] worthy of it all
[3:49:55] forever
[3:50:01] [Music]
[3:50:03] you deserve the glory
[3:50:14] just for those of you who are going to
[3:50:16] linger here just a moment sister joshana
[3:50:19] has a testimony
[3:50:22] this is not the time maybe but
[3:50:25] thank you so much
[3:50:28] she sent
[3:50:29] warm homemade home-cooked tapioca
[3:50:32] pudding to my house last night
[3:50:35] and that was amazing
[3:50:48] praise
[3:50:50] standing over there was just overwhelmed
[3:50:52] with gratitude and thankfulness for all
[3:50:55] the Lord has done for me in the past few
[3:50:57] months
[3:50:58] so many of you have been part of that
[3:51:00] Journey so many of you have prayed
[3:51:02] prayed for me prayed for us prayed for
[3:51:04] Edith
[3:51:08] and God cares about the tiniest little
[3:51:10] details oh yes
[3:51:13] maybe this seems like
[3:51:16] a loose stuff
[3:51:17] somebody who always had a really good
[3:51:18] memory that's really frustrating and I
[3:51:21] was standing at the sink last night and
[3:51:22] I'm like Lord will you please just show
[3:51:24] me
[3:51:25] and he brought a picture before my mind
[3:51:27] of a bucket that I had been dipping out
[3:51:29] of I don't even remember the night that
[3:51:31] I'd been doing it
[3:51:33] and he said go get that bucket and have
[3:51:35] him open it in the morning the spoon
[3:51:37] will be in there
[3:51:38] and this morning I asked him to go open
[3:51:40] that bucket and he wanted to argue with
[3:51:42] me he said that's not in there
[3:51:44] please just go open the bucket
[3:51:47] it was in there and it just reminded me
[3:51:48] that that God care about the tiniest
[3:51:51] little bitty details
[3:51:55] and
[3:51:57] All of You prayed for my daughter who
[3:52:00] was colicky and screamed in pain for
[3:52:03] hours on end many of you came to my
[3:52:05] house and helped me hold her because she
[3:52:07] wouldn't let us lay her down it was
[3:52:11] hard and we had gotten to the point we
[3:52:13] didn't know what else to do the doctor
[3:52:15] was telling us one thing but the Holy
[3:52:17] Spirit kept telling us another thing
[3:52:19] and one day I was I was actually getting
[3:52:21] out of the shower and I was just like
[3:52:24] I hadn't been able to make it to church
[3:52:25] had been streaming and I text for the
[3:52:27] Shelly and I said will you please have
[3:52:30] prayer for my daughter
[3:52:31] I'm not there but she is
[3:52:34] and we can't keep waiting for her to
[3:52:36] quote outgrow what is a natural thing
[3:52:40] and I'm telling you God moved he did
[3:52:43] moved
[3:52:44] and I didn't even realize how quickly
[3:52:47] he'd moved until the end of the week
[3:52:49] after that prayer
[3:52:51] I realized she was drinking her bottle
[3:52:53] laying on her back that was not
[3:52:55] something she could do before the month
[3:52:57] was out there were no more colic
[3:52:59] episodes she's been a sweet happy shouty
[3:53:04] loud
[3:53:06] but happy and she'll she'll just she
[3:53:09] loves to be in the presence of the Lord
[3:53:11] and I'm sorry thankful for God answering
[3:53:15] prayer for myself for her
[3:53:18] the strength comes back little by little
[3:53:20] it's not as fast as I want it to be but
[3:53:22] I just wanted to say thank you Lord for
[3:53:25] your blessings on me amen thank you
[3:53:29] praise the Lord
[3:53:36] praise God
[3:53:38] amen
[3:53:41] second notice you're dismissed ago in
[3:53:43] the name of the Lord that was a good
[3:53:45] testimony to hear
[3:54:03] over time
