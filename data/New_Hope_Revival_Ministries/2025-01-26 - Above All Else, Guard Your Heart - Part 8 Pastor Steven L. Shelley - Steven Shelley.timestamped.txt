[59:14] this morning I could hear you not just
[59:17] the microphone I could hear you as a
[59:20] congregation singing the old hymn we

[59:35] it's all right to feel him there's no
[59:38] crime to feel the presence of the Lord

[59:44] couldn't feel him I'd be very concerned
[59:47] because I appreciate knowing he's in the
[59:50] house he's in the house he wants to help
[59:55] us if you want to be
[59:57] helped amen you may be seated just a
[1:00:01] moment give me that key you were singing
[1:00:04] lighthouse
[1:00:06] in
[1:00:07] everybody that lives around us says now
[1:00:14] why don't you tear that old light house
[1:00:19] down oh the big ships don't
[1:00:23] sail this way anymore there ain't no use
[1:00:29] in that old thing hanging
[1:00:33] around oh but then my mind goes back to
[1:00:38] that
[1:00:39] stormy
[1:00:41] night when just in time I saw the light
[1:00:48] it was the light from that Old
[1:00:54] Lighthouse the one
[1:00:56] that stands up there on a hill the verse
[1:01:00] again the verse
[1:01:02] again

[1:01:14] house
[1:01:15] down you know the big
[1:01:18] ships they don't sail this way anymore
[1:01:23] there ain't no use in that old thing
[1:01:27] standing around listen now but then my
[1:01:32] mind goes back to that
[1:01:36] stormy
[1:01:38] night when just in time I saw the light
[1:01:44] it was the light from that Old ligh
[1:01:50] House the one that stands on cou
[1:01:56] seal and I
[1:02:03] thank I don't hear you

[1:02:19] liouse and from them old rocks of sin
[1:02:25] woo

[1:02:28] shown a light around me is that your
[1:02:34] testimony that I might
[1:02:38] clearly

[1:02:44] for that Old
[1:02:47] Lighthouse tell me where would this I
[1:02:52] want you to listen one more time I'm
[1:02:54] inspired
[1:02:55] [Music]
[1:02:57] everybody that lives around us can you
[1:03:02] imagine they said why don't you tear
[1:03:05] that Old Lighthouse down it's not
[1:03:08] popular oldtime religion you know the
[1:03:10] big ships they don't sell this way
[1:03:16] anymore there just ain't no use in that
[1:03:19] old thing hanging around oh but in my
[1:03:25] mind
[1:03:26] goes
[1:03:27] back to that stormy
[1:03:32] night when just in time thank God I Saw
[1:03:37] The Light it was the light from that Old
[1:03:44] Lighthouse the one that stands on
[1:03:49] Cal H and I thank
[1:03:54] God for
[1:03:57] L I owe him
[1:04:04] everything I owe him everything for
[1:04:09] Jesus woo
[1:04:12] glory glory to God
[1:04:18] and oh he has he has sh the
[1:04:23] light his light around me so that I can
[1:04:31] clearly
[1:04:33] see oh and if it wasn't
[1:04:38] for the
[1:04:41] lighthouse tell me
[1:04:44] where isn't that a good question this
[1:04:48] morning tell me where would this ship be
[1:04:55] Lord I don't even
[1:04:58] know I'm not even
[1:05:01] sure I'm not even sure today where I
[1:05:04] would
[1:05:05] be he didn't just do it
[1:05:08] once he didn't just send the light once
[1:05:12] but he sent a light more than once for
[1:05:15] me Hallelujah he'll do it even
[1:05:18] now if you find yourself tossed against
[1:05:22] the
[1:05:22] Rocks I want you to know there's still
[1:05:25] alive Hallelujah just a minute
[1:05:28] hallelujah
[1:05:30] hallelujah hallelujah they're still
[1:05:34] alive Jesus said I am the light of the
[1:05:37] world and he still is hallelujah there
[1:05:41] is no darkness in him no shadow of
[1:05:45] turning he's forever more the same Jesus
[1:05:49] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:05:52] forever I didn't sing that because Kade
[1:05:55] was wasn't doing a wonderful job he's do
[1:05:57] he did a marvelous job it was so good it
[1:06:00] inspired
[1:06:01] me and I will I almost grabbed the mic I
[1:06:04] saw it laying there almost grabbed it
[1:06:06] and just sung it with him but that verse
[1:06:08] gets me
[1:06:10] sometime because it's just the way it is
[1:06:13] you know they're they're they have to
[1:06:15] work hard to protect the I like
[1:06:18] lighthouses anyway I love them I think
[1:06:21] they're one of the most interesting
[1:06:22] things I'd rather see that sometime than
[1:06:25] than a civil war statue or something you
[1:06:27] know and I was standing in Cape hatus
[1:06:31] and uh watch that Lighthouse before they
[1:06:34] moved it can you imagine they picked it
[1:06:37] up and moved it it's the famous one the
[1:06:40] black and white Lighthouse C hatus North
[1:06:43] Carolina and I was standing there
[1:06:46] thinking wonder how many
[1:06:48] lives that light
[1:06:51] saved wonder how many ships got lost in
[1:06:54] a storm depended on that light to keep
[1:06:57] them from hitting the Rocks because if
[1:06:59] you know anything about that Outer Banks
[1:07:01] of North Carolina you know it's kind of
[1:07:03] Dangerous Waters out there and I'm so
[1:07:07] thankful for that analogy that a light
[1:07:10] comes shining across the fo and rescued
[1:07:13] us that's why we serve the Lord today
[1:07:15] folks if we lose our sight of how he
[1:07:19] found
[1:07:19] us we've really missed it you can get
[1:07:23] your Revelations and your your high and
[1:07:26] haughty Revelation you can get all that
[1:07:29] and miss the Simplicity of the
[1:07:31] Gospel amen we've been introduced to
[1:07:35] Jesus Christ he's been raised a
[1:07:38] generation ago out of the pages of
[1:07:40] history and he stood alive and well
[1:07:44] doing the same things that he did when
[1:07:47] he lived in his Earthly body that same
[1:07:51] Jesus that lived in William brandham
[1:07:53] lives in me and he lives in you and
[1:07:57] we've got to keep our eyes on him he's
[1:08:00] the lighthouse if you're already bored
[1:08:03] you're not going to last very long in
[1:08:05] this service but I'm stirred I'm just
[1:08:09] inspired I'm just stirred I'm thankful
[1:08:13] that I'm a
[1:08:15] Christian I've been baptized in the name
[1:08:17] of the Lord Jesus Christ which is the
[1:08:20] only Christian
[1:08:23] baptism everything else is off the
[1:08:26] word and I've been Sanctified what a
[1:08:29] word what an oldfashioned word the old
[1:08:33] timers used to stand up and say I thank
[1:08:35] God I'm saved Sanctified and filled with
[1:08:37] the Holy Ghost you wouldn't hear that
[1:08:40] anymore not in most places but I'm glad
[1:08:44] that he Sanctified me and he filled me
[1:08:47] with the Holy Ghost and like they used
[1:08:50] to say the walking talking Holy Ghost th
[1:08:53] this age has not uh uh given the Holy
[1:08:57] Ghost laryngitis or taken his voice he
[1:09:00] still speaks in the heart of the
[1:09:03] believer and you know you don't need a
[1:09:06] prophecy it's good if God will give you
[1:09:08] one but you don't have to have that he
[1:09:11] spoke to us in the volume of the book
[1:09:15] it's there he spoke to us in his word
[1:09:19] and then went to
[1:09:20] amazing amazing lengths to preserve that
[1:09:24] word for us to have it today and then he
[1:09:28] gave us understanding of that word
[1:09:32] praise God and our absolute is not our
[1:09:37] understanding our absolute is the
[1:09:39] foundation of the word if that's not
[1:09:43] enough for you I don't know what to say
[1:09:45] to you because the Bible said the very
[1:09:47] Church of Jesus Christ is laid on the
[1:09:49] foundation of the
[1:09:51] Apostles plural and the prophets plural
[1:09:56] and when he said that he's talking about
[1:09:58] those who wrote the
[1:10:00] scripture I know that but I want you to
[1:10:03] know he is not a handicapped or or freak
[1:10:09] God he still has a fivefold Ministry he
[1:10:13] doesn't start it to lose it well praise
[1:10:16] God thank you musicians let's give them
[1:10:18] a hand Hallelujah
[1:10:24] [Applause]
[1:10:27] thank you for your prayers I need a
[1:10:28] little more in the in the monitor just a
[1:10:30] tad thank you for your prayers for us
[1:10:34] God was good we we had some snow on
[1:10:39] Sunday and uh coming down pretty hard
[1:10:42] there but God gave us the practice there
[1:10:45] that we needed for here because when I
[1:10:48] left here Tuesday afternoon uh going
[1:10:51] home after coming home on Monday evening
[1:10:54] I came I had to come to work on Monday
[1:10:56] and when I was leaving it was snowing
[1:10:59] Harder Faster than it was in Tennessee
[1:11:03] when we were there on Sunday and it was
[1:11:05] I I don't think I've ever said this but
[1:11:08] it was
[1:11:12] beautiful when I see snow I usually
[1:11:14] think
[1:11:16] mess sloppy wet soupy mashed potatoes
[1:11:21] and gravy mess CU when it starts melting
[1:11:24] and the dirt runs in it I think it is it
[1:11:26] looks more like KFC than it does
[1:11:29] Beauty but there was something beautiful
[1:11:32] about it Jonathan the only other
[1:11:34] beautiful snow I've ever seen is in the
[1:11:36] Holy Land being there when it snows in
[1:11:39] Jerusalem and hearing the mind of the
[1:11:42] Lord saying uh I'm purifying I'm sending
[1:11:46] uh a reminder that though your sins be
[1:11:49] as
[1:11:50] Scarlet they shall be quier than snow
[1:11:56] how many of you saw the video footage
[1:11:58] that RJ uh posted let me see your hand
[1:12:01] if you watched it I want to see your
[1:12:02] hand there's quite a few of you that
[1:12:04] didn't see it I think we ought to even
[1:12:06] though he's not able to be here this
[1:12:08] morning I think we ought to congratulate
[1:12:10] and thank him for for that
[1:12:13] [Applause]
[1:12:15] presentation take a little time to watch
[1:12:19] it because it's not only just beautiful
[1:12:21] Drone footage of this
[1:12:23] property but it's also a prophetic
[1:12:27] message from scripture to us in this
[1:12:30] hour and it was so beautiful and uh I
[1:12:33] just the minute I saw it I kept can I
[1:12:36] share it can I share it will you share
[1:12:38] it can somebody share it because I I
[1:12:41] know that sometimes uh RJ s sort of
[1:12:44] private about things that I didn't know
[1:12:46] if he made it for for me he sent it to
[1:12:49] me or if he made it for the but I just
[1:12:52] was going to I already got my arguments
[1:12:54] ready and I was going to talk him into
[1:12:56] it and the next morning I saw that it
[1:13:00] was posted and I was so blessed by that
[1:13:02] it really blessed me God's given us a
[1:13:05] beautiful place here and you just
[1:13:07] beautified it before you leave be sure
[1:13:09] to look out there and see the Snowman
[1:13:10] that was built here on Wednesday he's
[1:13:13] still standing now he's leaning a little
[1:13:16] but he's still standing I I I tell you
[1:13:19] he's a tough tough snowman because we've
[1:13:22] had some warm weather yesterday got up
[1:13:24] little in the low 50s and uh so thank
[1:13:27] you for praying I want you to turn to
[1:13:29] Genesis 4 my glasses are so dirty till I
[1:13:33] can't see anything and maybe that's why
[1:13:36] you were looking so beautiful to me all
[1:13:38] of a
[1:13:39] sudden maybe if I wash maybe if I clean
[1:13:41] them you're you're not going to look
[1:13:44] quite as pretty I might see more
[1:13:45] wrinkles but uh I earned
[1:13:49] mine I've told you before I didn't know
[1:13:51] I had any till sister gey told me
[1:13:55] it never occurred to me isn't it crazy
[1:13:57] how you can get and she was just talking
[1:14:01] and we were just carrying on about it
[1:14:03] and and she said I see you've got a few
[1:14:05] of their friends smile lines and that
[1:14:08] was at uh who had their be seated just a
[1:14:11] minute I got to clean my glasses and I
[1:14:13] feel relaxed and some somebody's trying
[1:14:16] to rush me and uh I've not been here I
[1:14:20] wasn't here last Sunday we didn't get
[1:14:22] together on Tuesday I don't know why you
[1:14:24] came in your hurry
[1:14:26] today just take your time get your nap
[1:14:29] this afternoon and the world will seem
[1:14:31] like a better place is that right we had
[1:14:36] wonderful Fellowship in Tennessee it was
[1:14:38] like going home to Mama it was when
[1:14:41] sister Shirley told us goodbye last
[1:14:43] Sunday afternoon we spent the afternoon
[1:14:45] in her home and I sat with her on the
[1:14:49] couch
[1:14:50] and don't tell nobody but we held hands
[1:14:55] been like a mother to me in years past
[1:14:58] and you don't forget those
[1:15:00] things and they sacrifice so many times
[1:15:03] to support my
[1:15:05] meetings and they knew that I was making
[1:15:07] everybody mad everywhere I went and so
[1:15:10] they would drive for hours just to say
[1:15:13] amen and brother Bill used to say I can
[1:15:16] preach some of them
[1:15:17] [Music]
[1:15:18] sermons from memory better than you can
[1:15:21] because I've heard you preach them so
[1:15:22] many times but God was good to us and
[1:15:26] they took us on Saturday afternoon for a
[1:15:29] wonderful meal on a beautiful farm and
[1:15:33] the snow was was there you could see
[1:15:36] snow that had fallen and it was a
[1:15:39] beautiful thing
[1:15:40] and I thought we were in a country place
[1:15:43] and we were but they told us that Dolly
[1:15:46] Parton had been there the day before for
[1:15:47] her birthday
[1:15:49] party and uh I said well I tell you I
[1:15:51] feel like a celebrity getting to come to
[1:15:54] a place like like this it was a blessing
[1:15:56] and then Sunday morning we had a a a
[1:15:59] nice number of people came out old
[1:16:01] friends some I hadn't seen in years and
[1:16:04] a wonderful move of the spirit of God I
[1:16:07] cried buckets and buckets of tears and
[1:16:10] it didn't hurt me it didn't make me less
[1:16:11] of a man and it didn't hurt me I'm
[1:16:15] waiting on
[1:16:16] you it it it won't make you less of a
[1:16:19] man it might make you more of a man
[1:16:22] because Granny said if a if a head leaks
[1:16:25] it'll never
[1:16:26] swell I just cried buckets the spirit of
[1:16:29] conviction came and God moved among us
[1:16:32] and we had a wonderful time and there
[1:16:35] were some things mended and healed and
[1:16:38] I've been getting notes all week long
[1:16:41] I'm thankful for that I have to say I I
[1:16:43] know brother gy surely did a wonderful
[1:16:46] job last Sunday I haven't heard the
[1:16:48] service yet but I had good reports and I
[1:16:51] know that it was good they're not here
[1:16:53] today because this this beef weekend and
[1:16:57] they had to go pick up their slaughtered
[1:16:59] cow and uh it was finally ready and and
[1:17:03] uh they I think it seemed like it might
[1:17:05] have been ready on the shower weekend
[1:17:08] and they could not be here for that and
[1:17:11] then they were I think maybe they told
[1:17:13] them next weekend originally and that
[1:17:15] was the fellowship meeting and so they
[1:17:17] just took the only chance they had to go
[1:17:20] and brother gy I think is is visiting
[1:17:23] today at brother bills
[1:17:25] uh Church in in Tennessee there just to
[1:17:27] be another strength and comfort to them
[1:17:30] and God blessed us with good uh travel
[1:17:33] and with safety and I told them before I
[1:17:36] left I won't give you this one one
[1:17:38] little word I told told them before we
[1:17:40] came I don't I'm paying my own way I
[1:17:43] don't want an offering I don't want gas
[1:17:46] I don't want a hotel God's been good to
[1:17:49] us the credit card is clear and I want
[1:17:52] to do this as a thank you and I love
[1:17:55] offering for for you all and uh so we
[1:17:58] got there and they had us in a place
[1:18:01] called Homewood Suites if you ever seen
[1:18:03] one of those it's a Hilton property and
[1:18:05] there's a lady that is a general manager
[1:18:07] for some of those hotels who goes to
[1:18:09] church there at Lighthouse for Jesus we
[1:18:12] had two Suites in one Suite we had two
[1:18:15] bedrooms one bedroom two king-size beds
[1:18:19] one bedroom one king-size bed and then
[1:18:21] another Suite with a king-size bed both
[1:18:25] kitchens and we stayed three nights and
[1:18:28] you know how much the bill was
[1:18:32] $178 they gave us the both suits for $58
[1:18:37] a night plus tax so you know you just
[1:18:41] don't beat
[1:18:42] that a suite like we were in would have
[1:18:46] cost more than
[1:18:48] $178 I know you're wondering why are you
[1:18:50] taking time to share that because that
[1:18:51] was the goodness of God to me and I want
[1:18:54] to tell it because I I need him to do
[1:18:56] that
[1:18:58] again you can stand again God bless you
[1:19:00] you're
[1:19:04] faithful next weekend Fellowship
[1:19:06] meetings Saturday night 6 o'clock Sunday
[1:19:09] morning 11:00 we'll be getting a menu
[1:19:13] together for our fellowship and there
[1:19:15] are quite a few people coming I didn't
[1:19:18] know until this morning that there were
[1:19:20] as many as are coming coming some from
[1:19:24] West Virginia some who have never been
[1:19:26] here before are coming and we're
[1:19:28] thankful for that and then some from our
[1:19:31] Indiana group we don't know who all will
[1:19:33] be here but we believe God's going to do
[1:19:35] something outstanding there's something
[1:19:37] in the
[1:19:39] air I feel it I felt it this morning
[1:19:42] something is in the air and I know it's
[1:19:45] him it smells like him feels like him it
[1:19:48] sounds like him are you all right we had
[1:19:51] a nice time yesterday I know you're
[1:19:53] standing but we had a nice time
[1:19:55] yesterday I don't I can't go to every
[1:19:57] birthday party I just can't and I don't
[1:20:00] go anywhere on Saturdays usually at all
[1:20:02] I mostly stay at home but I thought if
[1:20:05] Sarah was going to come all the way up
[1:20:07] here well they were going to go all the
[1:20:09] way down to get her and bring her up
[1:20:10] here for Wyatt to have a first birthday
[1:20:13] party I was going to certainly be there
[1:20:15] and it was the most enjoyable two hours
[1:20:19] I've had in a long time it was a Pap's
[1:20:22] dream come true I got to sit on the sofa
[1:20:26] and watch a room full of children one to
[1:20:31] what they were playing with one another
[1:20:35] so pleasant and so kind and they got
[1:20:38] along every time I bragged a mother
[1:20:40] would say well you ain't been in the
[1:20:42] nursery it's not always like that in the
[1:20:43] nursery but for some reason maybe it's
[1:20:46] because I was watching over
[1:20:48] them it just blessed me I said my this
[1:20:51] is a Pap's dream come true to see all
[1:20:54] these beautiful children hasn't God been
[1:20:56] good to us oh he's been so good to us
[1:21:00] and I'm thankful for
[1:21:03] it

[1:21:08] don't know if any I don't know if
[1:21:09] brother gy gets the birthdays together

[1:22:31] all the gross and complicated details
[1:22:35] you just say Lord this one is yours and
[1:22:38] I'm believing you to move Heaven and
[1:22:41] Earth to get them what they need and I
[1:22:45] want to say before we read the scripture
[1:22:48] uh that we are so very very proud of
[1:22:53] Levi joury and and uh I didn't know if
[1:22:57] he was allowed to wear his uniform or
[1:22:59] not but sometime I sure would like for
[1:23:01] him to wear it it to service and show
[1:23:03] off that
[1:23:05] badge it's shiny and he earned it it
[1:23:10] wasn't just a complimentary gift to him
[1:23:12] he earned it and we got to go and watch
[1:23:14] him graduate on Friday from firefighter
[1:23:16] school and I said so now Levi when is
[1:23:19] your first shift he said started this
[1:23:21] morning at 8:00
[1:23:24] and we're
[1:23:25] thankful and you live in this area he's
[1:23:28] one of our
[1:23:30] firefighters and so pay your
[1:23:34] bill pay your fire protection bill
[1:23:38] because you may need them one
[1:23:41] day oh it's quiet pay it a portion of it
[1:23:45] comes out of your property taxes if you
[1:23:47] get a bill pay it you can do it you can
[1:23:51] do it less Starbucks more protection
[1:23:54] from for your home so it don't burn down
[1:23:56] oh I feel like
[1:23:58] preaching I couldn't have been more
[1:24:01] proud to watch him he's handsome he's
[1:24:04] strong and tall and he's worked hard and
[1:24:07] he looked uh dashing maybe the first
[1:24:10] time I've ever thought of him as dashing
[1:24:13] but he looked dashing in that
[1:24:15] uniform and uh I'm just proud I know it
[1:24:18] was a lot of work and we're just very
[1:24:19] thankful for your persevering
[1:24:27] Genesis chapter 4 it's just see it's
[1:24:30] just 12:19 that didn't hurt
[1:24:32] nobody we're going to carry
[1:24:36] on we're in a series if you want to call
[1:24:40] it a series I think this would be number
[1:24:44] eight and it's called above all
[1:24:48] else we're still talking about the
[1:24:51] importance of guarding our heart
[1:24:54] and we have settled down here now for
[1:24:56] just a little while on the spirit of
[1:24:59] offense and we're still there we hadn't
[1:25:01] got started
[1:25:02] yet and I wouldn't give it so much
[1:25:05] attention had I not felt like I should
[1:25:09] and had the Lord not strongly dealt with
[1:25:12] my heart that it has been our biggest
[1:25:16] hindrance in all the years of being
[1:25:20] together with you folks since 1990
[1:25:24] if there's been one thing that I could
[1:25:26] say by
[1:25:28] inspiration has hindered us more than
[1:25:30] anything else it's those who have
[1:25:33] carried a spirit of
[1:25:35] offense and I have to tell you that in
[1:25:38] these nearly 35 would be 35
[1:25:41] years uh in
[1:25:43] September uh I've had one a time or two
[1:25:46] myself and so I'm not putting this on
[1:25:49] anybody but we need to hear it and if
[1:25:52] you're standing here this morning and
[1:25:54] you're still carrying that chip on your
[1:25:56] shoulder that the Bible identifies as as
[1:26:00] a spirit of offense you need to get it
[1:26:02] knocked off
[1:26:05] today you need to get that thing out of
[1:26:08] your heart out of your life out of your
[1:26:10] family out of your home and out of this
[1:26:14] church because it is
[1:26:18] absolutely necessary for offense to come
[1:26:23] Jesus said so
[1:26:25] if they didn't come we wouldn't have
[1:26:27] anything to
[1:26:28] overcome but
[1:26:30] iron isn't that what the scripture said
[1:26:34] so we're going to go back to what we
[1:26:36] covered Tuesday night was a week ago and
[1:26:39] go on Genesis CH 4: 3-8 and in process
[1:26:44] of time it came to pass that Cain Cen
[1:26:49] brought of the fruit of the ground an
[1:26:52] offering unto the Lord
[1:26:55] and Abel Havel hav he also brought of
[1:26:59] the firstlings of his flock and of the
[1:27:03] fat thereof and the Lord had respect
[1:27:09] someone say respect if you've gained the
[1:27:12] respect of the Lord you've gained
[1:27:15] something you you understand that we
[1:27:18] like to be respected respect is earned
[1:27:21] but there are times that we are resp
[1:27:24] responsible to show respect in
[1:27:27] situations where it has not been
[1:27:30] earned we're like for instance the
[1:27:33] office that someone holds the president
[1:27:36] of the United States who may not be our
[1:27:38] particular uh flavor or we may not have
[1:27:43] voted for him but it's our duty and
[1:27:46] responsibility as citizens of this
[1:27:48] nation to show respect for their
[1:27:52] office and and I'm Amazed that people
[1:27:54] can do that I'm also amazed when people
[1:27:57] refuse to do that but this is so much
[1:27:59] higher than that the Lord had respect
[1:28:03] unto havl Abel the Lord had respect unto
[1:28:09] him
[1:28:11] and and to his offering it's important
[1:28:16] to note but un Cain and to his offering
[1:28:20] he had no respect so the Lord respected
[1:28:23] Abel and his offering but to Cain he had
[1:28:26] no respect as a person and he had no
[1:28:29] respect for his offering and Cain was
[1:28:33] very
[1:28:34] rough and that doesn't mean agitated
[1:28:37] it's a little more serious than that and
[1:28:39] his countenance fell have you ever
[1:28:42] watched somebody's countenance
[1:28:45] fall one
[1:28:48] word can bring somebody out of their
[1:28:50] happy place into reality amen I don't
[1:28:54] want to be responsible all the time for
[1:28:56] doing that but sometimes as a minister
[1:28:59] uh and a pastor we have to be
[1:29:01] responsible for somebody's countenance
[1:29:04] to fall but I pray that when you get
[1:29:08] over your
[1:29:10] Wess you'll get glad again because we
[1:29:14] need the word to help us
[1:29:16] amen if thou doest well why are you
[1:29:19] wroth he goes on to say in verse six and
[1:29:22] the Lord said unto Kain why why art thou
[1:29:24] wroth and why is thy countenance Fallen
[1:29:27] if thou doest
[1:29:30] well sh thou not be accepted question
[1:29:33] mark and if thou doest not well sin lith
[1:29:37] at the door and unto thee shall be his
[1:29:41] desire and thou shalt rule over him
[1:29:47] these are prophetic words they speak
[1:29:50] forward do you understand that and Cain
[1:29:53] talk with Abel his brother they tried to
[1:29:57] talk it
[1:29:58] over it wasn't a lack of communication
[1:30:01] that caused the
[1:30:02] altercation but came to pass which means
[1:30:06] some moments later sometime later when
[1:30:09] they were in the field that Cain rose up
[1:30:12] against Abel his brother and what did he
[1:30:14] do slew him he didn't just knock him
[1:30:17] down he took his
[1:30:19] life father we thank you today that you
[1:30:22] have given us this great Grace to be
[1:30:25] here and and and I hope everyone can see
[1:30:28] how glad I am to be in this house how
[1:30:31] glad I am to be in your presence how
[1:30:34] glad I am to sing your praises today
[1:30:36] Lord and I need you to come because you
[1:30:39] have certainly pressed on my heart that
[1:30:42] above all the things that we have dealt
[1:30:45] with there's a root and the root is and
[1:30:48] has always
[1:30:50] been the the the lack of delivery
[1:30:55] for the spirit of offense and it
[1:30:57] compounds like a snowball rolling down
[1:31:01] the hill but I pray that when this thing
[1:31:04] is over that there will not be one
[1:31:07] smidgen not one jot or TI of that past
[1:31:13] offense left in US you're shaking
[1:31:18] everything that can be shaken you're
[1:31:22] letting that offense rise to the surface
[1:31:26] because you're getting ready to deal
[1:31:29] with it with your
[1:31:31] sword and I want to thank you it's a
[1:31:34] two-edged sword it doesn't hang on your
[1:31:37] hip it's in your mouth and Lord we
[1:31:41] release you in every way to send that
[1:31:44] sword to deal with the root of a spirit
[1:31:47] of offense the root is always envy and
[1:31:51] jealousy dig it out Lord Jesus help us
[1:31:56] above all else to be Gardeners of our
[1:32:00] own garden our own heart Watchmen on the
[1:32:03] wall over what you've in invested in us
[1:32:07] and given to us we will praise you for
[1:32:10] an anointing that destroys yolks this
[1:32:12] morning in the precious name of the Lord
[1:32:14] Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be
[1:32:17] seated do me this one favor if your
[1:32:19] neighbor does off
[1:32:21] gently gently shake them
[1:32:25] don't embarrass them just gently wake
[1:32:29] them because this is for them how do you
[1:32:32] know because it's for every person who
[1:32:35] has an ear to hear I want the Lord's
[1:32:38] sword to get right down to it over the
[1:32:42] course of the next few Services together
[1:32:44] now I'm not going to go through
[1:32:46] everything that we have already uh
[1:32:48] looked at and Tuesday night was a week
[1:32:51] ago I believe that was January the 14th
[1:32:54] we did some pretty good study we covered
[1:32:56] a lot of ground in one evening but I
[1:32:59] have to go back and hit just a few
[1:33:00] things before we move on and in order to
[1:33:03] do that I'd like to go to Hebrews 11 if
[1:33:06] you happen to have your Bible there uh
[1:33:09] it's nice to use it it it helps you to
[1:33:13] know like I've said before where a
[1:33:15] scripture is on the page and if you're
[1:33:18] like me you may not remember the address
[1:33:20] always but you know where it's at on the
[1:33:22] page upper right hand corner or down on
[1:33:25] and so use your Bible bring it with you
[1:33:27] don't leave it here somebody said I've
[1:33:29] got a dozen more at home well that's
[1:33:32] lovely but take it with you bring it
[1:33:34] take it and use it it's life it's life
[1:33:40] to us it's our absolute Foundation the
[1:33:43] word of God Amen and we can dig oh my we
[1:33:49] can dig if you have that desire you can
[1:33:54] get as deep as you want to get you can
[1:33:56] have deeper understanding somebody said
[1:33:58] I thought we had all the understanding
[1:34:00] we need that's wrong that's not the case
[1:34:02] we're not talking about Revelation we're
[1:34:04] talking about understanding you can you
[1:34:07] can be under Revelation and not have
[1:34:10] understanding understanding is being
[1:34:12] able to apply that if you know it but
[1:34:15] you can't use
[1:34:17] it if you know it but you can't apply it
[1:34:21] you can't appropriate it then it's not
[1:34:24] doing you maximum good is it so we want
[1:34:28] to know it by Revelation and we want to
[1:34:31] have great grace to understand it and we
[1:34:34] want to practice it I I find myself
[1:34:38] having to use it and don't be religious
[1:34:42] we're going to get to that in a minute
[1:34:43] don't be religious nobody wants
[1:34:49] religion it
[1:34:51] stinks we're not talking about oldtime
[1:34:54] religion that's a entirely different
[1:34:57] definition of the word we're talking
[1:35:00] about the kind of religion that's as the
[1:35:04] Pharisees as the Sadducees we have some
[1:35:07] in this message
[1:35:09] Pharisees jot and tit
[1:35:12] folks marking everything to the
[1:35:16] comma they'd say well you know brother
[1:35:19] Adam put a comma he didn't put a comma
[1:35:21] anywhere he's talking
[1:35:24] it's the editors that put a comma and if
[1:35:27] you don't think a comma matters just
[1:35:29] look up some of those little idioms that
[1:35:31] they post a comma
[1:35:33] matters it can really matter and so we
[1:35:36] need the discernment of the spirit to
[1:35:38] know which is the article that's being
[1:35:41] modified or you can really have a
[1:35:44] Doctrine that's outside the word and
[1:35:46] we've got some around the world of the
[1:35:48] message we've got doctrines that aren't
[1:35:50] even biblical doctrines and they just
[1:35:52] keep preaching them expounding on them
[1:35:55] over and over and over again and they're
[1:35:57] not Bas somebody say well if he said it
[1:35:59] I'm not saying he didn't say something
[1:36:01] similar but if that comma is not in the
[1:36:03] right place and you apply the whole
[1:36:06] modification of a of a half a sentence
[1:36:10] to the wrong
[1:36:12] subject you've really missed somebody
[1:36:14] said why are you talking like that
[1:36:16] technical because when you're breaking
[1:36:18] down the timeline of end time events how
[1:36:21] many of you know it's kind of important
[1:36:23] to know what comes before and so we
[1:36:26] should be very careful not to to hang
[1:36:30] everything on one little comment let's
[1:36:34] take it back to God's word let's see
[1:36:37] what it says and go forward
[1:36:41] amen Hebrews 11:4 H by faith how did he
[1:36:46] do it by faith Abel offered unto God a
[1:36:49] more excellent sacrifice than Cain did
[1:36:53] you know the Bible talks about giving
[1:36:54] God an excellent
[1:36:57] praise and in this reference in this
[1:37:00] context that word excellent there is
[1:37:03] talking about above and
[1:37:05] beyond one that is more than average I
[1:37:09] anybody can be mediocre in their life
[1:37:12] for Christ but I don't want to be
[1:37:14] mediocre I don't I want to serve
[1:37:17] him with everything I've got I do folks
[1:37:22] it's never necessary for overcoming
[1:37:26] virtue in the end time to just go ahead
[1:37:28] and give him everything serve him with
[1:37:30] everything you've got we can get so
[1:37:34] passionate about things we like and
[1:37:36] enjoy down here throw your passion into
[1:37:39] serving God and serve him to the
[1:37:42] uttermost give him an excellent
[1:37:44] Sacrifice by faith Abel offered unto God
[1:37:47] a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by
[1:37:49] which he obtained witness that he was
[1:37:53] right righteous God testifying of his
[1:37:58] gifts and by it being dead this is
[1:38:02] incredible the scripture in the New
[1:38:05] Testament refers to Abel as a
[1:38:10] prophet and yet we have no record of his
[1:38:13] prophetic
[1:38:15] Ministry but the Bible lets us know he
[1:38:18] is indeed a prophet and his message is
[1:38:22] continuing even until this
[1:38:26] hour Paul said it's his
[1:38:28] blood crying out come
[1:38:32] on it testifies of God's favor and it
[1:38:37] testifies of the jealousy of
[1:38:40] religion and the Envy of religion so
[1:38:44] he's still preaching to us
[1:38:46] today and so the ministry I I want to
[1:38:51] make sure you understand the
[1:38:52] effectiveness of of a Ministry doesn't
[1:38:55] just have to especially a
[1:38:57] messenger doesn't have to only be within
[1:39:01] his
[1:39:02] lifetime it can carry on praise God for
[1:39:07] that we have at least seven examples of
[1:39:11] that kind of carrying on a message a
[1:39:13] Ministry that goes beyond the lifetime
[1:39:17] of the
[1:39:18] mouthpiece and in some cases it becomes
[1:39:20] more effective
[1:39:24] because you get the star off the
[1:39:27] scene and everybody starts looking a
[1:39:29] little
[1:39:30] higher John I must
[1:39:33] decrease he must increase what did you
[1:39:36] come to see you know this is a great
[1:39:39] question what are you looking for well
[1:39:41] I'm not looking for another messenger
[1:39:44] I'm not looking for another Prophet
[1:39:46] messenger I'm not looking for another
[1:39:49] message I'm looking for Christ to be
[1:39:52] formed formed in me I'm looking for
[1:39:56] Christ to be formed in you this is the
[1:39:59] great mystery Christ in you what the
[1:40:03] hope of glory in that reference hope is
[1:40:08] expectation the expectation of Glory you
[1:40:13] may have lost your passion for eternity
[1:40:17] but eternity is getting nearer to us by
[1:40:20] the moment let me tell you whether you
[1:40:23] can hear it or not time is running
[1:40:28] out the sand is almost out of the top of
[1:40:33] the sand of The
[1:40:35] Hourglass it really is we are just a few
[1:40:39] seconds until midnight and time will be
[1:40:44] no more eternity will break upon us and
[1:40:48] there's only one thing that's going to
[1:40:50] matter as that eternity breaks upon us
[1:40:53] and that is did you have
[1:40:56] Christ how much of him did you allow to
[1:40:59] be formed in
[1:41:02] you that's going to determine the
[1:41:08] bride because here we hope and we feel
[1:41:14] and we some of us have Revelation that
[1:41:17] we're a part of that number but for many
[1:41:20] there's that nagging doubt
[1:41:23] in the back of their mind am I really
[1:41:25] one of those well let me tell you
[1:41:27] something the more of Christ you allow
[1:41:29] to be formed in you you are
[1:41:32] demonstrating What gene you are of what
[1:41:36] DNA you carry and there are some folks
[1:41:39] here this morning they may not be the
[1:41:42] loudest they they may not be the most
[1:41:45] popular but there are some folks here in
[1:41:48] this house today who I know beyond the
[1:41:51] shadow of a doubt carry the jeans seat
[1:41:53] of
[1:41:54] God it's going to matter it's going to
[1:41:57] matter because their spiritual DNA is
[1:42:00] going to kick in and give them strength
[1:42:04] to stand against the last raging storm
[1:42:09] of
[1:42:11] leoda leoda is not finished shaking its
[1:42:16] tail there's a little more to get over
[1:42:19] but I'm going over I'm going over by the
[1:42:22] help and grace of God I've told you
[1:42:25] before you you feel a little you know
[1:42:27] you don't want to testify too much of
[1:42:29] that because you don't want someone to
[1:42:31] think it's Pride I used to hear the
[1:42:33] oldtimers brother Ellas sing this old
[1:42:36] song if anybody makes it all the way
[1:42:40] home surely I will anybody ever heard
[1:42:43] that and I sat as a child on the Pew and
[1:42:46] I thought oh that's brag you you know
[1:42:49] that's bragging a little bit that that
[1:42:51] sounds a little prideful all you got to
[1:42:54] do is have a a decade of Holy Ghost life
[1:42:58] fighting Devils left and
[1:43:02] right 10 years fighting left and right
[1:43:06] and you'll be up right down right up in
[1:43:08] the middle of Flor them old Tim singing
[1:43:10] if anybody makes it all the way home
[1:43:12] surely I will shake your neighbor
[1:43:14] they're
[1:43:15] sleeping I'm serious this
[1:43:20] morning you'll be right up in the middle
[1:43:23] because you begin to realize if you
[1:43:25] don't know your own heart that heart's
[1:43:28] deceitful and if you don't know you
[1:43:30] who's going to know you but the Holy
[1:43:32] Spirit you've got to come to the place
[1:43:34] where you know who you are and by
[1:43:36] Revelation you realize that you're a
[1:43:38] part of his life and that's the only
[1:43:40] reason why you believe what you believe
[1:43:42] and stand on what you stand and may I
[1:43:45] say again today and I'll say it again as
[1:43:48] often as it comes to my heart it
[1:43:51] matters it matters what you
[1:43:55] believe sir we're not going to argue
[1:43:58] over how long past the knee it ought to
[1:44:02] be I think you ought to know
[1:44:05] that I can just say this if you sit down
[1:44:08] and you have to
[1:44:12] pull it's going to get quiet I thought
[1:44:14] i' have a little
[1:44:16] water if you have to
[1:44:18] twist and Pull and
[1:44:21] yank two things you ought to know if
[1:44:23] you've got
[1:44:25] sense that's rough huh it's not long
[1:44:28] enough and it's not big
[1:44:30] enough or you wouldn't have to Waddle it
[1:44:34] down come on and I don't have time to
[1:44:38] preach that you ought to know
[1:44:42] that you ought to get that this ain't
[1:44:45] the world some of you grew up in this is
[1:44:48] a filthy World somebody said I'm an old
[1:44:51] woman it don't matter how I do I'm an
[1:44:53] old woman ain't nobody you just don't
[1:44:54] know how
[1:44:56] sick how
[1:44:58] deprived how how Wicked this old world
[1:45:01] is you stand for God every chance you
[1:45:04] get but we don't have time to keep
[1:45:07] pounding down those kinds of things let
[1:45:09] the spirit of God uh help you and if you
[1:45:12] can hear him I'll I'll remind you from
[1:45:15] time to time but what I want you to know
[1:45:18] more than anything else is we've got to
[1:45:20] get out of here we've got to we've got
[1:45:22] to finish
[1:45:23] well it's not enough just to finish a
[1:45:26] race we've got to finish well we've got
[1:45:28] to finish his
[1:45:29] Overcomers we can't take on somebody
[1:45:31] else's battle if you're not called to a
[1:45:35] battle butt
[1:45:39] out why would you want to fight a battle
[1:45:42] that you're not called
[1:45:44] to if God has called you to punch your
[1:45:47] neighbor I mean gently
[1:45:53] why in this world would anybody want to
[1:45:57] fight a battle that's nothing to them
[1:45:59] you've heard that expression I don't
[1:46:01] have a dog in the fight if you don't
[1:46:03] have a dog in the fight you stay home
[1:46:05] that's right don't jump in and try to
[1:46:07] fight somebody else's battle unless you
[1:46:10] know the Lord has called you stand with
[1:46:12] one another stand for truth support one
[1:46:18] another but you don't have to fight
[1:46:20] somebody else's battle because here's
[1:46:22] what'll happen you will'll take on their
[1:46:24] offense and how many of you know you've
[1:46:26] got your own you working with you got
[1:46:28] your own things that hurt your feelings
[1:46:30] and offend you and worry you and trouble
[1:46:33] you and disturb you you don't have time
[1:46:35] to take on somebody else's if you want a
[1:46:38] project if you want a goal if you want
[1:46:41] something to keep you moving forward in
[1:46:43] 2025 put your eyes on Jesus see him in
[1:46:47] the mirror when you look at it when you
[1:46:50] look at this word instead of seeing your
[1:46:53] shortcomings see his
[1:46:55] Perfection I disagree with the
[1:46:58] interpretation that many people continue
[1:47:01] to beat beat beat through the years that
[1:47:04] we look there to see how wrong we
[1:47:06] are that was the
[1:47:10] law it was right that was the law that
[1:47:13] was the instruction that was the purpose
[1:47:16] of the giving of the of the law you look
[1:47:18] at the law as a mirror you see how short
[1:47:21] you are you you see your pimple you see
[1:47:24] your crooked nose you see then Grace
[1:47:27] comes and Grace changes the mirror
[1:47:31] because you're no longer seeing how ugly
[1:47:33] you are when you look in the mirror in
[1:47:35] fact if you're looking like the Apostle
[1:47:37] Paul said you're not seeing yourself at
[1:47:39] all you're seeing the Lord Jesus there
[1:47:43] and you know the Bible says we are
[1:47:45] changed this is powerful scripture we're
[1:47:49] Changed by looking upon him the more you
[1:47:53] look at him
[1:47:55] hahaa the more we look at Jesus in his
[1:47:58] word the more we see his Perfection the
[1:48:02] more like him we
[1:48:03] become my goodness so if you if you're
[1:48:06] one of those who continues to want to
[1:48:08] see your crooked nose and your you know
[1:48:11] and your droopy eye and your and your
[1:48:15] Crow
[1:48:19] feet sister V is not the only one that
[1:48:22] knows about cro on your
[1:48:23] face if you keep seeing that you how in
[1:48:27] the world will you ever have any passion
[1:48:29] or motivation to be more like him you
[1:48:32] think he's forsaken me I'm looking
[1:48:36] uglier by the minute this is not working
[1:48:40] when I look all I see is my is my bad
[1:48:43] thoughts and all I see is is my my
[1:48:46] shortcomings and all I see is my
[1:48:49] failures and and how I don't measure up
[1:48:53] but you catch a revelation of him and
[1:48:55] let him be your vision come on somebody
[1:48:58] and the Bible said we're changed from
[1:49:00] glory to glory we're transfigured is the
[1:49:02] right we're transfigured by seeing him
[1:49:06] look Upon Jesus and live brother brandom
[1:49:09] preached look
[1:49:12] away that means you may not see him if
[1:49:15] all you're doing is looking at your
[1:49:16] present circumstances and Surround Look
[1:49:18] Away to him he's ever more alive
[1:49:23] oh
[1:49:24] Hallelujah shake them come on I don't
[1:49:28] see you doing it so the next next thing
[1:49:30] will be
[1:49:31] names I'm serious this morning I didn't
[1:49:34] come here to entertain
[1:49:37] anybody I've labored before the Lord for
[1:49:39] this and I don't want you to think that
[1:49:42] you have an excuse or anyone else has an
[1:49:44] excuse well I you know I didn't hear it
[1:49:46] you can hear
[1:49:50] it by faith able thank God he obtained a
[1:49:56] witness that he was righteous God
[1:49:59] testifying of his gifts and by it he
[1:50:02] being dead yet speaketh yet prophesieth
[1:50:08] that word sacrifice there he offered a
[1:50:12] more excellent sacrifice is the Greek
[1:50:15] word thusia enthusia is an offering it's
[1:50:20] the act or the vict victim in other
[1:50:24] words it's the person offering the
[1:50:27] sacrifice or thusia can also be the
[1:50:32] sacrifice itself does that say anything
[1:50:34] to
[1:50:35] anybody the same
[1:50:38] word the same
[1:50:40] word it can either be talking about the
[1:50:44] lamb or the one who offers the
[1:50:47] lamb so when you see that word sacrifice
[1:50:50] in the New Testament it's most often
[1:50:54] thusia and it's important to know that
[1:50:57] it's talking about both the
[1:51:00] giver and the
[1:51:02] victim the one that is given why is that
[1:51:06] important to know because brother
[1:51:08] Brandon by Revelation told us it's not
[1:51:11] the Perfection of the
[1:51:14] worshipper it's not the sinless life of
[1:51:17] the worshipper it's the
[1:51:20] lamb but the scripture is in in Greek in
[1:51:23] the New Testament doesn't show any
[1:51:26] differentiation between the one giving
[1:51:28] the lamb and the lamb itself that's a
[1:51:32] revelation you are your
[1:51:35] offering
[1:51:37] Abel was his offering Abel was his
[1:51:41] sacrifice there was no difference
[1:51:43] somebody said what do you mean by that
[1:51:45] the prophet tells us that as
[1:51:48] Abel was digging away at the jugular
[1:51:52] vein of his favorite
[1:51:54] lamb anybody that's seen a severed main
[1:51:58] artery of the body knows that the blood
[1:52:01] doesn't just trickle
[1:52:03] out it pumps like a
[1:52:07] cannon every time the heart beats is
[1:52:10] that right it shoots that blood and
[1:52:13] listen Abel is wrestling around trying
[1:52:16] to take the life of a lamb that he
[1:52:19] dearly loved because he had a Revelation
[1:52:24] that it was by Blood man was going to
[1:52:27] find his ultimate
[1:52:29] reconciliation and so instead of giving
[1:52:32] him
[1:52:33] turnips and
[1:52:35] potatoes and
[1:52:37] parsnips like Cain did Abel gave him
[1:52:40] something that had blood in it Precious
[1:52:44] Blood and Abel said I'm not only going
[1:52:46] to give you the life of what I love so
[1:52:48] dearly but I'm going to take the fat and
[1:52:51] I'm going to lay that on the altar as
[1:52:53] well because the the the giving of the
[1:52:57] fat after you have given the first of
[1:53:00] the flock is to say that is my tithe and
[1:53:04] this is my
[1:53:06] offering I want to stand before God
[1:53:09] having met both of my
[1:53:11] responsibilities I've given him what he
[1:53:13] said was already his and I've taken a
[1:53:16] portion of that that could have been
[1:53:18] mine and it wasn't just talking about
[1:53:21] the blubber fat
[1:53:22] when the scripture talks about the fat
[1:53:24] thereof it's talking about not only fat
[1:53:27] but
[1:53:28] meat it's a word that is used for not
[1:53:31] only just the fat that's no good to eat
[1:53:34] but also the meat that's attached to the
[1:53:37] fat and if anybody knows anything about
[1:53:40] fat and and beef for
[1:53:43] instance
[1:53:45] W you got to have it you may trim it off
[1:53:50] or it may melt if it's marbled but if
[1:53:53] you trim it before you cook it and you
[1:53:55] take all the fat off you're not going to
[1:53:58] have the same
[1:54:02] taste it's the fat that gives it the
[1:54:05] flavor and that's how it is
[1:54:07] spiritually you give God what's his
[1:54:09] you're keeping Covenant with him you put
[1:54:12] something on top of that the fat thereof
[1:54:14] and God says wait a minute he's not only
[1:54:16] willing to trust me with what belongs to
[1:54:18] me but he's willing to trust me with a
[1:54:21] portion of what is his is that's what
[1:54:24] Abel did that was a revelation and when
[1:54:26] that jugular vein don't miss this when
[1:54:29] that jugular vein began to pump like a
[1:54:31] cannon that blood out of the Little
[1:54:33] Lamb's body it's
[1:54:38] spilled all over the
[1:54:40] one giving the offering so the sacrifice
[1:54:45] can be both the one
[1:54:47] giving and the one being given that's
[1:54:51] you and brother the brandom said Abel
[1:54:53] got covered woo he got covered in the
[1:54:57] blood of his own
[1:55:00] offering he got bathed in the blood of
[1:55:04] his own sacrifice and you and I do the
[1:55:07] same and thusia tells us that the
[1:55:11] offering the thusia the sacrifice of
[1:55:16] Abel was more excellent because it was a
[1:55:19] firstling it had blood he gave the fat
[1:55:22] thereof and in the process of its
[1:55:25] offering he became the sacrifice because
[1:55:29] the blood was dripping off of his beard
[1:55:31] somebody said that disgusts me that
[1:55:33] makes me nauseated that's that's because
[1:55:35] you're looking at blood like human blood
[1:55:38] you're looking at blood like you would
[1:55:40] look at your child who's who's hurt
[1:55:42] themselves and and you panic that's not
[1:55:45] what we're talking about oh we're
[1:55:47] talking about something beautiful I want
[1:55:49] you to know the blood that bathed able
[1:55:51] that day was beautiful blood
[1:55:52] because it was making him the offering
[1:55:55] but that does not even begin to compare
[1:55:58] with the blood that you and I have been
[1:56:01] bathed
[1:56:03] in no wonder it's not our Perfection but
[1:56:06] the one of the Lamb that we give because
[1:56:08] that blood has spilled back on us
[1:56:11] brother brandom said it couldn't be an
[1:56:12] animal for complete Redemption because
[1:56:15] it was animal
[1:56:17] life that was in that blood meaning
[1:56:20] there was no soul
[1:56:26] there was no middle
[1:56:28] ground that that animal doesn't have a
[1:56:31] middle ground does it have a personality
[1:56:34] sure it can does it have a nature sure
[1:56:36] it can can it be gentle sure it can can
[1:56:39] it be uh abrupt sure it can but it
[1:56:42] doesn't have a
[1:56:43] soul it's the middle ground so love them
[1:56:48] treat them amazing be good to your
[1:56:50] animal if you're going to have one but
[1:56:51] don't make make it a man don't make it a
[1:56:54] woman there's no middle ground it
[1:56:56] doesn't have that that life that was in
[1:56:58] that lamb could not have saved Abel
[1:57:01] under this
[1:57:03] Covenant no no no no brother bam said
[1:57:06] the life that was in that blood was
[1:57:07] animal life so it took a different kind
[1:57:09] of blood it took a special blood a blood
[1:57:13] created not just to keep an animal
[1:57:15] bleeding bleeding moaning whatever an
[1:57:19] animal does ask John Caleb or Caleb John
[1:57:22] when you see him he'll tell you what any
[1:57:23] animal in the book does he'll make the
[1:57:25] sound he'll bring it out of his toes in
[1:57:28] fact he's the most enthusiastic roaring
[1:57:31] lion I've ever met brother Luke in my
[1:57:33] life I've never met a more enthusiastic
[1:57:35] lion or tiger or bear or whatever he
[1:57:38] asked me did I want to hear his animal
[1:57:40] sounds one day and I thought oh my you
[1:57:42] know he's going to say
[1:57:46] meow but when he reached down in his
[1:57:48] toes and he started pulling up this
[1:57:50] sound it I thought I was standing in the
[1:57:52] presence of that kind of an animal but
[1:57:55] that life falling back on a worshipper
[1:57:57] would not do much for them because
[1:57:59] there's no middle ground oh but he made
[1:58:03] a blood a perfect blood come on somebody
[1:58:05] somebody thrill with me thrill with me
[1:58:09] that you've been
[1:58:11] covered no wonder lny wolf wrote it is a
[1:58:15] perfect blood it is a perfect
[1:58:18] blood Hallelujah no imperfection in it
[1:58:22] at all it's a perfect blood and it makes
[1:58:25] a Perfect Bride body and we can't lose
[1:58:29] our
[1:58:31] enthusiasm for the
[1:58:35] blood some have taken a quotation or two
[1:58:39] where brother brandom said you're not
[1:58:40] saved by the blood you're saved by grace
[1:58:43] and they have made a
[1:58:45] Doctrine oh I've been sitting for 2 and
[1:58:48] 1 half hours while they preached a
[1:58:51] doctrine that has no scriptural basis
[1:58:54] whatsoever none he said it's not the
[1:58:58] you're sa by Grace let me tell you
[1:58:59] something scripturally we know and we
[1:59:01] take it to the rest of the message where
[1:59:04] he told us it's the life of the
[1:59:08] blood but you know that was at
[1:59:12] Calvary 2,000 years ago it was actuated
[1:59:15] on planet Earth it was in the mind of
[1:59:17] God that the lamb shed his blood John
[1:59:20] was caught up to see it and Revelation
[1:59:22] chap 4 he was caught up into heaven and
[1:59:25] began to see the unfolding of what was
[1:59:27] going to happen we talked about it just
[1:59:29] here the other day we were together we
[1:59:31] talked about that but it's the reality
[1:59:34] it's the reality of it that means so
[1:59:37] much can you say amen and so without
[1:59:40] without
[1:59:42] Grace how would I get the life that was
[1:59:45] in the blood shed in the mind of God
[1:59:48] before the foundation of the world how
[1:59:49] would I get it to my house
[1:59:53] how would I get some of that blood that
[1:59:56] that he shed literal blood he shed 2,000
[1:59:59] years ago plus on on
[2:00:01] Calvary and the chemistry of that blood
[2:00:04] fell into the Earth and I've said to you
[2:00:06] many times hundreds of times if you were
[2:00:08] to go with a knife and scrape the the
[2:00:11] Crusty dried blood if you could find it
[2:00:14] today it would do nothing for you it
[2:00:16] would become another
[2:00:17] icon it would become another plaque
[2:00:21] another something for the Catholics to
[2:00:24] worship but he couldn't save
[2:00:26] you it's not the
[2:00:29] chemistry it's the
[2:00:31] life something had to get the life to
[2:00:33] you something had to get the blood to
[2:00:36] you and that's what Grace did oh my
[2:00:39] don't you ever think that you're are
[2:00:42] saved by
[2:00:46] works come on don't be a
[2:00:49] Pharisee you're not saved by by
[2:00:52] by broadening the Hem of your Ro
[2:00:56] brother that's how the Pharisees did it
[2:01:00] they started in increasing the border of
[2:01:02] their
[2:01:04] sleeve and they started uh increasing
[2:01:08] the the Border it was a contrasting
[2:01:10] Fabric and they started making the
[2:01:12] border of their hymn in a contrasting
[2:01:16] fabric making it taller and taller so
[2:01:19] that all you needed was enough to keep
[2:01:21] the robe from from what do you call it
[2:01:23] fra fraying fraying I knew frazzle
[2:01:25] wasn't right fraying so they just saw a
[2:01:27] little border but the Pharisees oh they
[2:01:30] loved their righteousness but it was all
[2:01:33] of their own behavior and doing it was
[2:01:35] quite hyp so
[2:01:37] hypocritical it still is today my
[2:01:40] goodness you're trying to work on
[2:01:43] somebody else's
[2:01:45] life you you're trying to fix somebody
[2:01:48] else oh my we need to take a good to
[2:01:52] look at ourselves first the scripture
[2:01:54] said why are you
[2:01:57] worrying about the
[2:02:01] toothpick in your brother's eye sister
[2:02:05] Beverly's given me lots of
[2:02:07] amens why are you worried about the
[2:02:09] toothpick in your brother's eye when
[2:02:12] you've got a telephone
[2:02:14] pole in your own eye somebody said I
[2:02:17] never read that in the scripture oh yes
[2:02:18] you did
[2:02:22] you just read Mo and
[2:02:25] beam oh we who speak King James English
[2:02:28] even when we sleep and
[2:02:33] prophesy but if I ask you who's who who
[2:02:36] knows what a mode is you children you
[2:02:38] young children would say to me why it's
[2:02:40] that
[2:02:41] trench that's dug around the castle to
[2:02:45] keep the dragon
[2:02:47] out correct very few of you unless you
[2:02:51] knew it from scripture would know that a
[2:02:54] moat is just a small
[2:02:56] particle something very small and so I
[2:02:59] like to take it a little way anybody in
[2:03:02] here know what a telephone pole is
[2:03:04] anybody in here know what a toothpick is
[2:03:07] so if you've got a toothpick in your eye
[2:03:09] you ought to be concerned about that
[2:03:12] much more than concerned about somebody
[2:03:14] else if you got a telephone pole in your
[2:03:16] eye that's much bigger than a toothpick
[2:03:20] they strain it a that this is the very
[2:03:22] they strain it a
[2:03:25] that and swallow a
[2:03:29] camel don't you let religion get a hold
[2:03:32] of you
[2:03:34] Cain you know Cain knew
[2:03:38] how you know I'm finding out uh they're
[2:03:41] putting
[2:03:43] Steeples on message churches
[2:03:49] today it it blows my mind
[2:03:53] mind when I heard this message 30 plus
[2:03:56] years ago they understood that that is
[2:04:00] not a religious symbol he going to be
[2:04:03] quiet it's not a religious symbol at all
[2:04:06] it's modeled after the
[2:04:08] oblique the
[2:04:11] oblisk don't even do any research to
[2:04:14] find out what that's modeled
[2:04:17] after it's a sign of Babylon
[2:04:22] I hear somebody say well we want to be
[2:04:25] more like the other churches no you
[2:04:27] don't that's the
[2:04:32] problem the other night it was
[2:04:34] Nightfall as we were driving in to
[2:04:37] Johnson
[2:04:39] City crossing the
[2:04:41] mountain I'm telling you that's a that's
[2:04:44] a
[2:04:44] mountain in the old days we we drove
[2:04:47] through the
[2:04:49] valley on a two-lane road
[2:04:55] now we go over the top of the mountain
[2:04:58] on a
[2:04:59] highway ears popping all the way up and
[2:05:01] all the way
[2:05:03] down it was dark and we couldn't see the
[2:05:06] damage but coming out we saw the damage
[2:05:10] in Irwin Tennessee I'm telling you
[2:05:13] destroyed by a hurricane of all things
[2:05:17] 30s something miles of railroad still
[2:05:19] washed out
[2:05:23] and some of you wouldd be amazed to know
[2:05:25] that sitting right in the middle of the
[2:05:26] destruction is a trailer
[2:05:30] park mobile homes it looked like they
[2:05:32] were at least 40 years
[2:05:34] old I couldn't see a piece of metal bent
[2:05:36] on
[2:05:37] them but on the other side gone on the
[2:05:41] other side
[2:05:43] gone now somebody tell me that there's
[2:05:46] not sovereignty in
[2:05:48] God it it blows your mind you'd think
[2:05:50] that'd be the first thing to go the
[2:05:53] flood had dep
[2:05:55] part to leave those mile homes
[2:05:58] there who who who can think of such a
[2:06:01] thing as that but we're riding down on
[2:06:04] the highway now and we're coming into
[2:06:06] Johnson City and the song comes to my
[2:06:09] mind that sister y sister kette
[2:06:14] Yan the mother of the Yon brothers who
[2:06:17] sang with Louis blevens and anybody
[2:06:20] who's been around the Ministry for a
[2:06:22] long time would know the name Louis
[2:06:25] bevens and the Yan Brothers they sung
[2:06:28] amazing
[2:06:29] songs and their little mother sister
[2:06:32] cozette Yan who's been with the Lord a
[2:06:34] long time now I had the privilege of
[2:06:37] knowing her and when she played the
[2:06:39] piano she shook
[2:06:41] it her and Kade would get along just
[2:06:45] fine except she she had a little more
[2:06:48] Howard Goodman in her than Kate does
[2:06:52] she raised her wrist a whole lot higher
[2:06:54] than he does and she sung a song that
[2:06:57] she wrote I'd like to read it for you is
[2:06:59] that all right I asked brother Bill I
[2:07:02] asked brother lenel I ran into brother
[2:07:04] lenel at uh where TJ Maxx or somewhere
[2:07:08] like
[2:07:09] that and I asked him if he remembered if
[2:07:12] if the song had any verses he said he he
[2:07:15] thought it might but he just didn't
[2:07:16] remember at the time I mentioned it to
[2:07:18] brother Bill 81 years old he said oh yes
[2:07:21] and I know exactly where they are and he
[2:07:24] was able to pull them up and I want to
[2:07:26] read them to you hold your
[2:07:29] breath she wrote this song many many
[2:07:32] years ago with when Jesus name baptism
[2:07:34] was Blazing a trail through those
[2:07:36] mountains oh look out
[2:07:40] Babylon it's already offensive to the
[2:07:43] modern Church world you're getting ready
[2:07:45] to
[2:07:46] fall look out Babylon you're getting
[2:07:50] your last call you've deceived this
[2:07:52] nation long enough you've built your
[2:07:54] Steeples tall but the name of Jesus is
[2:07:58] getting higher and you're getting ready
[2:08:00] to fall I thought it didn't matter how
[2:08:02] you're baptized it
[2:08:04] matters I thought it didn't matter if
[2:08:06] God was three persons or one it
[2:08:09] matters it it the difference is between
[2:08:12] Babylon and the bride that's a
[2:08:16] wide
[2:08:17] difference come
[2:08:20] on here's the verse you've caused the
[2:08:23] people to go astray and to lose their
[2:08:26] souls in hell you've draw the People by
[2:08:30] the power of Satan and the toning of
[2:08:34] your Bell but God said in one hour your
[2:08:37] judgment would come for Mercy you'll
[2:08:39] weep and mourn and all your riches shall
[2:08:42] pass away and you'll find them no more
[2:08:46] look out Babylon you built your
[2:08:49] synagogue so fine but your money was
[2:08:51] been in vain you've spilled the blood of
[2:08:53] the saints of God and denied Our God's
[2:08:56] name you've nailed Our Savior to the
[2:08:58] Cross you've mocked and whipped him too
[2:09:00] but he's coming back with his mighty
[2:09:02] wrath to bring revenge on you oh look
[2:09:05] out Babylon you're getting ready to fall
[2:09:07] look out Babylon you're getting your
[2:09:09] last call you've deceived this nation
[2:09:11] long enough you built your Steeples tall
[2:09:13] but the name of Jesus is getting higher
[2:09:16] and you're getting ready to
[2:09:18] fall somebody ought to say something
[2:09:23] somebody ought to say something and now
[2:09:25] they're concerned about stained
[2:09:28] glass even around us stained glass we
[2:09:32] got a and a steeple because we want to
[2:09:34] look like other churches
[2:09:37] folks that Spirit of Babylon is alive
[2:09:41] and it's well and it's creeping in it's
[2:09:45] going to take a sold out
[2:09:47] number it's going to take a sold out
[2:09:50] people who don't have time to want to be
[2:09:53] petted and they don't have time to want
[2:09:56] to be rubbed and they don't have time to
[2:09:59] want to be consoled
[2:10:01] even they've got to run they've got to
[2:10:04] run somebody's got to run somebody's got
[2:10:07] to run we are running for our lives we
[2:10:12] are running from Babylon we are running
[2:10:16] back into the side of the crucified
[2:10:19] Christ we got got to get back to where
[2:10:22] we came
[2:10:24] from we've got to get back to his
[2:10:27] original thoughts concerning our life so
[2:10:30] we don't have time for some other stuff
[2:10:33] we don't have time to nurse our
[2:10:38] offenses I'm missing some
[2:10:40] amens we don't have time to give one
[2:10:44] another
[2:10:47] bottles are you saying we shouldn't be
[2:10:49] kind we got to be kind we won't want to
[2:10:51] be
[2:10:53] kind but we're not going to
[2:11:00] compromise there's a vast difference
[2:11:03] between kindness and
[2:11:08] compromise there there's such hypocrisy
[2:11:11] that tries to take a hold of people once
[2:11:13] they carry that
[2:11:15] offense then from my relatives to shack
[2:11:19] up it's fornication and adultery
[2:11:23] but for yours it's lack of
[2:11:27] funds have you seen how that
[2:11:31] works you you look over there somebody
[2:11:34] and I don't know who else to pick
[2:11:35] besides me but can I pick you so you
[2:11:39] look over there to ell we don't know
[2:11:40] anything about his family so this is all
[2:11:42] hypothetical but you look over there to
[2:11:43] Ellas and maybe he's got a relative is
[2:11:46] living with somebody they're not married
[2:11:47] to and oh my God have mercy what's wrong
[2:11:50] with them you know uh they there they
[2:11:53] must be the wrong seed there there must
[2:11:56] be no hope for them this late hour all
[2:11:59] the kinds of things that righteous
[2:12:00] self-righteous religious people who have
[2:12:03] no compassion because they have no
[2:12:06] passion for
[2:12:08] Christ and then the same thing happens
[2:12:10] in their family and you say well H I
[2:12:13] didn't know they were I I mean I didn't
[2:12:14] know they were together together I I
[2:12:17] didn't know they were Liv oh yeah they
[2:12:18] can't afford they can't afford a wedding
[2:12:25] so so so they're just doing the best
[2:12:28] can so in other words you you can make
[2:12:30] all kinds of excuses come
[2:12:33] on how did that get so big it got that
[2:12:36] big because somebody got
[2:12:39] offended and they never dealt with it
[2:12:42] and the snowball kept rolling and now it
[2:12:45] goes beyond their
[2:12:47] slackness to excusing their family
[2:12:50] slackness
[2:12:52] sir get off your phone hear the word of
[2:12:55] the
[2:12:57] Lord I'm mean
[2:12:59] it it's important to hear that it starts
[2:13:03] off she hurt my
[2:13:06] feelings and before it's over we're so
[2:13:09] far away from where we need to be right
[2:13:14] that we're having to run double time
[2:13:16] just to get back to where we used to be
[2:13:19] let me tell you something it's not the
[2:13:20] will of God God for this bride to be
[2:13:22] struggling to get back to where she
[2:13:24] was it's his will for us to be running
[2:13:27] on and in order to do that we may have
[2:13:31] to stop waiting for someone to
[2:13:33] legitimize our
[2:13:36] feelings and we may have to run on for
[2:13:38] Christ it's getting tough in here we may
[2:13:42] have to run on anyway how many of you've
[2:13:45] gotten gray hair waiting on somebody to
[2:13:47] apologize just run on anyway just run on
[2:13:50] anyway why does it
[2:13:53] matter somebody say I know it matters to
[2:13:56] God you let God worry about
[2:14:00] that run on brother run on sister run
[2:14:06] on we must we've got to we have
[2:14:11] to I'm not going to give you the rest of
[2:14:14] the definition God testifying of his
[2:14:16] gifts and by it being dead yet speaketh
[2:14:19] I want you to look at verse four
[2:14:22] I I should have been a mile past this
[2:14:26] 109 this is just one
[2:14:29] commentary I'm not going to give you but
[2:14:31] a couple but I have
[2:14:34] about 10 pages
[2:14:37] of examples one right after
[2:14:40] another of those who have studied the
[2:14:44] language and the continuity of
[2:14:48] scripture and understand that there's
[2:14:51] more happening in Genesis 4:4 than what
[2:14:54] we read in our English
[2:14:57] version in verse
[2:15:00] four this is a commentary I think I I I
[2:15:04] may have I may have may have given it to
[2:15:06] you after after the definitions there of
[2:15:09] sacrifice and obtain
[2:15:11] witness I may that's
[2:15:14] it
[2:15:17] well that is not it but it's coming
[2:15:20] that's not it yet let let me read what I
[2:15:22] have and we'll get to that in a moment
[2:15:24] by faith in the future Redeemer th this
[2:15:26] is this is precious precious commentary
[2:15:30] somebody said I I didn't come for
[2:15:32] commentary I want you to know we hear it
[2:15:34] every time we listen to the
[2:15:37] prophet I know there are some of you who
[2:15:39] believe that every word is thus sayith
[2:15:42] the Lord that would make brother brandom
[2:15:45] in a league of his own that would mean
[2:15:48] there was none like him not even Moses
[2:15:54] because every word Moses said wasn't
[2:15:55] thus sayith the Lord we know that by how
[2:15:59] God dealt with
[2:16:00] him come on let's be real let's just be
[2:16:03] real real no criticism no condemnation
[2:16:06] just be real real here it's very
[2:16:07] important to be
[2:16:09] real so by faith in the future Redeemer
[2:16:12] Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice
[2:16:15] the firstlings of his flock implying
[2:16:18] both a confession of what his own sins
[2:16:23] deserved and a desire in Sharing in the
[2:16:27] great atonement now what that means is
[2:16:30] by Faith by Revelation Abel looked
[2:16:37] ahead he looked ahead he's taking this
[2:16:40] Lamb's life but in his heart of hearts
[2:16:44] in the deepest part of his Spirit life
[2:16:47] there is a
[2:16:48] reality that there going to be many L
[2:16:51] this is one of
[2:16:52] many this perhaps is one of millions see
[2:16:55] it just a moment perhaps this is one of
[2:16:57] millions that are going to give their
[2:17:00] life through the dispensation of
[2:17:03] law I pray that by the same Revelation
[2:17:06] uh Abel and the New Testament seems to
[2:17:08] think that he did he looked further than
[2:17:11] the than the dispensation of Grace I
[2:17:13] mean of Law and he began to see into the
[2:17:16] dispensation of Grace and that little
[2:17:18] lamb that he was precious lamb that he
[2:17:20] was SA sacrificing and giving if by
[2:17:23] Revelation he saw that there were
[2:17:25] millions of lambs that would die under
[2:17:27] law he must have surely seen like
[2:17:31] Abraham did the day he offered was
[2:17:33] willing to offer his son Isaac Abel must
[2:17:36] have surely seen that there was a sure
[2:17:38] testimony coming up the road there was a
[2:17:41] more profound life there was a more
[2:17:43] profound and precious and perfect lamb
[2:17:45] one who would die and the Very blood
[2:17:47] that was in him would not release animal
[2:17:50] life but it would release the very
[2:17:52] Divine Life of God the very Zoe of God
[2:17:56] you have eternal life how many of you
[2:17:58] would believe I have eternal life I have
[2:18:00] eternal life through the shed blood of
[2:18:02] Jesus Christ and by Grace I have eternal
[2:18:04] life well that's God's own life it's
[2:18:06] God's own
[2:18:08] life and you now live in that life that
[2:18:11] life is now inside of you and here Abel
[2:18:14] saw
[2:18:17] it by faith Paul said by faith
[2:18:21] Hebrews 11 by faith but that word could
[2:18:24] easily be exchanged for by Revelation I
[2:18:28] think you'll hear that in a quote if you
[2:18:30] care to look it look it up it's there
[2:18:33] implying both a confession of what his
[2:18:36] own sins deserved and a desire Abel had
[2:18:39] a desire of sharing in the great
[2:18:43] atonement he was a for Forerunner of a
[2:18:46] greater atonement can you see that then
[2:18:49] Cain who who offer in testified of No
[2:18:52] Such Faith but a bare acknowledgement of
[2:18:55] God the Creator by which Faith he
[2:18:58] obtained both a righteousness and a
[2:19:00] testimony of it God this is the verse
[2:19:04] God
[2:19:05] testifying visibly that his gifts were
[2:19:08] accepted probably this is one of the
[2:19:11] original commentaries written on the
[2:19:13] scripture during the time of the early
[2:19:17] church visibly that his gifts were
[2:19:19] accepted probably probably by sending
[2:19:21] fire from heaven to consume his
[2:19:23] sacrifice you say wait a minute I didn't
[2:19:25] read that in Genesis 4 I didn't read
[2:19:26] that in Hebrews 11 here 4 or Genesis 4:4
[2:19:30] so how could anybody make that kind of a
[2:19:32] statement here is how because of the ex
[2:19:35] explanation of what took place visibly
[2:19:38] that his gifts were accepted probably by
[2:19:40] sending a fire from heaven to consume
[2:19:42] his sacrifice a token that Justice
[2:19:45] seized listen to this that Justice
[2:19:49] seized the sacrifice instead of The
[2:19:53] Sinner who offered it if fire came down
[2:19:57] from heaven and consumed that offering
[2:20:00] that Abel had given it proved that God
[2:20:03] was not after the destruction of able
[2:20:08] his Justice wasn't falling on the one
[2:20:11] giving his Justice was falling on the
[2:20:14] one being given that's why the New
[2:20:16] Testament says and though he knew no
[2:20:19] sin he was made sin for you and
[2:20:24] I oh my praise God so that the very
[2:20:28] justice of God you might like to word
[2:20:30] use the word
[2:20:32] judgment but the reality is in the
[2:20:35] English of King James it wouldn't be
[2:20:38] judgment as often as it would have been
[2:20:41] Justice because God's
[2:20:44] fair you and I aren't Fair life isn't
[2:20:47] fair but God is fair because he doesn't
[2:20:50] move on the emotional level of fair he
[2:20:52] moves on righteous
[2:20:55] Justice and he come down and the
[2:20:58] judgment and Justice of God was executed
[2:21:00] on God in flesh our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:21:04] and the life that was spilled not only
[2:21:06] fell on his
[2:21:08] mother it not only fell on those who
[2:21:10] were standing by spiritually but it fell
[2:21:13] on the upper
[2:21:14] room it fell in
[2:21:17] Ephesus it fell on Believers from
[2:21:19] Ephesus the way to leod deia that life
[2:21:23] of the Lamb is falling on Believers even
[2:21:26] today does anybody believe that and so I
[2:21:30] I am I'm persuaded for myself that even
[2:21:34] though the English does not reflect
[2:21:37] specifically and it goes on and I won't
[2:21:39] I won't take your time because I I would
[2:21:42] be surprised if any of you would be as
[2:21:45] interested in it as I am but I spent
[2:21:47] hours and hours going through it because
[2:21:49] it so blessed my blesser as the spirit
[2:21:53] would take us from verse to verse to
[2:21:54] verse to verse and show us how God
[2:21:57] always when he was showing pleasure o on
[2:22:01] the offering he come and got it with
[2:22:03] fire can you think of some
[2:22:06] examples can you think of a fiery torch
[2:22:10] that appeared out of
[2:22:13] nowhere you know the Scriptures it
[2:22:16] appeared out of nowhere and it began to
[2:22:18] move supernaturally of a t torch of fire
[2:22:22] that nobody lit it began to move
[2:22:24] supernaturally between the pieces of the
[2:22:27] offering and God was doing that
[2:22:30] signifying that this Covenant was a
[2:22:32] covenant that not man was not making it
[2:22:34] but God was making it come
[2:22:36] on how about how about
[2:22:39] Elijah how about Elijah why they they're
[2:22:42] going to have a showdown on Mount
[2:22:45] carel you you you think it would it
[2:22:48] would take a month to preus
[2:22:50] that they're they're going through all
[2:22:52] the the the raro of religion those false
[2:22:55] prophets of baale cutting themselves can
[2:22:57] you imagine cutting
[2:23:00] themselves isn't it amazing how that
[2:23:03] same Spirit has made its appearance in
[2:23:05] these last days with mental
[2:23:10] illness they're cutting themselves to
[2:23:13] try to get the attention of their
[2:23:15] God just like those who are emotionally
[2:23:17] disturbed would sometimes do it
[2:23:18] particularly young people falling into
[2:23:20] this is is such a horrible scary thing
[2:23:23] it's it's it's like the an
[2:23:26] anorexia or some of the other kinds of
[2:23:28] disorders it's such a scary thing it can
[2:23:31] so easily take somebody's
[2:23:33] life and they would never understand
[2:23:35] that it's for attention because they
[2:23:37] withdraw but but it's a cry it's a cry
[2:23:40] and young people taking Razer blades and
[2:23:43] cutting themselves and letting and heal
[2:23:44] up just to cry for attention but folks
[2:23:47] it's not an attention that you could
[2:23:49] give them enough
[2:23:51] they need
[2:23:52] him they need Jesus to wrap his arms
[2:23:55] around them they need to know that it's
[2:23:57] not religion but this
[2:23:59] relationship come on we don't have to
[2:24:01] compromise
[2:24:03] Holiness clean living to reach him no
[2:24:06] Siri they don't even want to loose goose
[2:24:09] way they want to they want to know that
[2:24:12] it matters they want to know that it
[2:24:14] counts they want to know that if I
[2:24:16] choose Christ it matters and I'm here to
[2:24:20] tell you it
[2:24:22] matters it matters these Priests of bail
[2:24:26] they're jumping around cutting
[2:24:27] themselves shake your neighbor in love
[2:24:31] bleeding all
[2:24:32] over trying to get their God to come
[2:24:35] down there is no God Elijah jumps up and
[2:24:37] starts mocking
[2:24:40] him oh he's going on your God is going
[2:24:43] on vacation or he's like some of the
[2:24:46] Saints at New Hope he's taking a nap
[2:24:53] H and nothing nothing moves a God who
[2:24:57] can't see who can't hear who can't feel
[2:25:00] who can't
[2:25:01] know and then then Elijah he just stands
[2:25:03] up and I it's less than 60 words I can't
[2:25:06] remember it's 50-some words so we'll
[2:25:08] just say less than 60 because I can't
[2:25:09] remember exactly the number now don't
[2:25:11] count them now count them later I know
[2:25:13] you're tempted I know you're tempted but
[2:25:15] do it when you get home and text me
[2:25:17] later would you please less than 60
[2:25:19] words he jumps up no cutting himself no
[2:25:21] screaming to his
[2:25:23] Gods no throwing himself on the Rocks
[2:25:26] hello come
[2:25:27] on he just gets up and braids this
[2:25:30] little simple prayer and guess what
[2:25:31] happens fire falls down from heaven
[2:25:34] consumes not only the
[2:25:38] sacrifice
[2:25:39] W but it licks up because remember he's
[2:25:42] had them to pour water on water on it
[2:25:44] water let's make this thing harder let's
[2:25:47] do it let's do it right let's really get
[2:25:49] her done
[2:25:51] and he fills up the trenches of water
[2:25:52] the fire comes down the old false
[2:25:56] prophet you know
[2:25:57] there's oh he's going too far this time
[2:26:00] there may be a little fire coming but
[2:26:02] it's not going to be enough for the
[2:26:03] Bible said it started it started
[2:26:05] consuming the
[2:26:08] Rocks do do you know that means that
[2:26:11] fire had to be hotter than the burning
[2:26:13] of jet
[2:26:16] fuel woo it had to be the kind of heat
[2:26:19] that took down the
[2:26:23] tower that's the kind of heat that came
[2:26:25] out of heaven and God said I'm pleased
[2:26:28] with what you're doing
[2:26:29] Elijah I could go on and on and on
[2:26:34] through the
[2:26:36] scripture Leviticus 9:24 there came a
[2:26:39] fire out from before the Lord and
[2:26:40] consumed upon the altar the burnt
[2:26:42] offering and the fat which when all the
[2:26:43] people saw they shouted and fell on
[2:26:45] their faces why because they knew that
[2:26:47] God had heard their prayer how did Cain
[2:26:53] know that God didn't want
[2:26:56] him his
[2:26:58] offering but he w't it able he had to
[2:27:01] see something Cain wasn't a man of
[2:27:04] Revelation he was a dense man he must
[2:27:06] have been quite dense in the head you
[2:27:08] know religious but dense he didn't
[2:27:11] figure that out on him on his own but
[2:27:14] when you've got turnips laying on your
[2:27:15] altar and your brother your twin brother
[2:27:17] over there has got his precious lamb and
[2:27:21] he he's making a bloody mess of himself
[2:27:23] and you're looking over there and you're
[2:27:24] wondering what's God going to do with
[2:27:26] these offerings and all of a sudden you
[2:27:28] see smoke begin to
[2:27:30] rise and fire beginning to fall I've got
[2:27:34] a feeling you're going to know that
[2:27:36] you're in
[2:27:39] trouble God was making a
[2:27:41] difference I'm moving
[2:27:44] on the word respect that appears in
[2:27:47] Genesis 4:4 give me just a few more
[2:27:49] minutes the word respect that appears in
[2:27:51] Genesis 4:4 it means to look at to
[2:27:54] regard to gaze at to look at anything
[2:27:57] with a keen Earnest glance which has
[2:28:00] been translated multiple times Kindle
[2:28:03] into a fire so that the Divine approval
[2:28:07] of Abel's offering was shown uh in its
[2:28:09] being consumed by fire that just came
[2:28:13] out of the out of the
[2:28:14] Lexicon the Hebrew verb that is used in
[2:28:18] Genesis 4:4 sha simply means to gaze at
[2:28:22] to have regard for to look on with favor
[2:28:25] or with devotion the text does not
[2:28:28] indicate how this was communicated but
[2:28:30] it indicates that Cain and Abel knew
[2:28:33] immediately who was
[2:28:36] received and whose was rejected would
[2:28:39] you trust John
[2:28:42] Wesley John Wesley's notes on the
[2:28:45] Bible John Wesley lived from 1703
[2:28:50] to
[2:28:52] 1791 let me read a little more details
[2:28:54] but hold that up there would you he was
[2:28:56] an Anglican cleric and theologian who
[2:28:59] founded the Methodist movement leading a
[2:29:01] Revival within the Church of England
[2:29:03] that emphasized personal faith social
[2:29:05] reform and Holiness of heart and life
[2:29:08] through his extensive traveling
[2:29:10] preaching and writing he established a
[2:29:12] Systematic Theology that combine
[2:29:15] Evangelical enthusiasm which is
[2:29:17] evangelism with rational thought while
[2:29:20] pioneering new methods of spreading the
[2:29:23] gospel which included protracted
[2:29:25] meetings and and tent meetings and
[2:29:27] public Gatherings and campgrounds even
[2:29:30] including open air preaching and
[2:29:32] establish small group meetings for
[2:29:34] spiritual growth John Wesley I'm telling
[2:29:36] you he was a Trailblazer in in his
[2:29:39] lifetime in the early 1700s you and I
[2:29:43] know him better as the sixth Church age
[2:29:46] Messenger to the Philadelphian Church
[2:29:48] age brother brandham suggests Ed that
[2:29:50] this age lasted from approximately
[2:29:57] 1750 now notice Wesley was born in
[2:30:01] 1703 but the church age brother the
[2:30:03] brandom is is suggesting approximately
[2:30:06] that it begins in 1750 is that right yes
[2:30:10] to
[2:30:12] 1906 now he's in keeping with Clarence
[2:30:18] Lin who also wrote wrote about the the
[2:30:22] beginning year and ending year of the
[2:30:25] Philadelphian Church age and Lin said
[2:30:29] that it ended in
[2:30:31] 1900 brother brandham carried it by
[2:30:34] inspiration to 1906 because that was the
[2:30:38] transition from sanctification to
[2:30:42] Pentecost to a full baptism of the Holy
[2:30:45] Ghost at isusa street you understand
[2:30:47] that don't you now let me give you this
[2:30:49] quickly in his words and then I'm going
[2:30:51] to tell you what John Wesley said about
[2:30:53] Genesis 4:4 and and we're studying now
[2:30:56] for those of you who who will and
[2:30:59] tonight this is the Philadelphia and
[2:31:01] church age message this is not the
[2:31:03] church age book this is the sermon 1960
[2:31:06] and tonight the church age is called the
[2:31:08] Philadelphian Church age remember that
[2:31:10] was the age before ours the age before
[2:31:14] leod deia you you understand and the
[2:31:17] star or the messenger remember John saw
[2:31:20] him Revelation one stars in his hand
[2:31:22] Seven stars the star or the messenger
[2:31:25] Angel Messenger to that age We Believe
[2:31:28] solemnly with all our heart to be John
[2:31:30] Wesley so brother brandham has a strong
[2:31:32] conviction that John Wesley was the one
[2:31:35] chosen to bring the message that was
[2:31:39] needed for the Philadelphian Church age
[2:31:42] he goes on to say the church age began
[2:31:44] in 1750 when the Lutheran Church age
[2:31:46] went
[2:31:48] out that was Martin Luther's age which
[2:31:51] was justification by faith and lasted up
[2:31:54] to somewhere in 1900 around
[2:31:58] 1906 he called that the wesleyian church
[2:32:01] age just like we might call Luther's age
[2:32:04] the Lutheran Church age although the
[2:32:06] scripture would call uh this wesleyian
[2:32:08] church age the Philadelphia Church age
[2:32:11] and then issued in from that the leodan
[2:32:16] so Philadelphia gave way for leoda how
[2:32:19] many you get that stay with me and now
[2:32:23] the age is the is the church age
[2:32:26] of that was the last Church
[2:32:29] age Brotherly Love isn't that
[2:32:34] amazing that we can't seem to master
[2:32:38] today are you are you listening yes look
[2:32:40] this way please put your phone
[2:32:44] down we we can't seem to master
[2:32:51] the emphasis of the last Church
[2:32:56] age brotherly
[2:32:58] love we got some work to do we got some
[2:33:01] running hard to do brother Ram said that
[2:33:03] was the age of Brotherly Love The Great
[2:33:05] missionary age and the open door age
[2:33:09] there was more accomplished to spread
[2:33:11] the gospel in the Philadelphia and
[2:33:14] church age under the leadership of char
[2:33:16] of John Wesley than had ever been a
[2:33:19] accomplished previously since the time
[2:33:21] of the Apostles now we can say that
[2:33:24] there has been more missionary effort
[2:33:26] gone forth in the Leo Dean Church age
[2:33:29] than any other age prior but it could
[2:33:31] also have been said about Philadelphia
[2:33:33] in the Philadelphian Church age more has
[2:33:35] been accomplished to win souls and that
[2:33:38] was under the leadership of men like
[2:33:40] John Wesley he said and the reward was a
[2:33:43] was a
[2:33:44] pillar
[2:33:45] remember I will grant to him to be a
[2:33:48] pillar in the house of my God and the
[2:33:51] revelation of three names the name of
[2:33:53] God the name of the city of God and
[2:33:56] God's new
[2:33:57] name is the Revelation that was given to
[2:34:00] this church in this age so he's clear he
[2:34:05] believed by conviction that it was John
[2:34:09] Wesley now let's move on to a message
[2:34:11] called turn on the light 1964 Stay With
[2:34:14] Me There came another time that the
[2:34:16] church should get away from its sins and
[2:34:18] be Sanctified along Came John Wesley a
[2:34:21] little Anglican man from over in England
[2:34:23] there that belonged to the Anglican
[2:34:24] church but he saw listen he saw the
[2:34:27] light on the gospel thank God it was the
[2:34:31] hour for that Philadelphian age to come
[2:34:34] forth are you here and when he did he
[2:34:37] preached what the second work of Grace a
[2:34:41] sanctification how how are we
[2:34:45] Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:34:47] by the washing of the water of the word
[2:34:49] he said there was nothing could stand in
[2:34:52] his in its light he was considered a
[2:34:54] fanatic Imagine John
[2:34:57] Wesley a fanatic just like Luther was a
[2:35:01] fanatic just like you
[2:35:06] are did you know people look at you the
[2:35:08] same way sometime you're just fanatic
[2:35:11] you drive P you drive past 50 churches
[2:35:13] to get over there you you you drive
[2:35:15] hours to get there you you just must be
[2:35:17] a fanatic they don't understand but
[2:35:19] protested all the rest of them shine
[2:35:21] forth a light because it was the
[2:35:24] light of the hour it was the light of
[2:35:28] the hour it was the light of the hour
[2:35:30] thank God God found a man John Wesley
[2:35:35] who could turn on the light he found a
[2:35:38] also a Luther that turned that light on
[2:35:42] or turned on the light for that age and
[2:35:45] one more the Masterpiece Jeffersonville
[2:35:48] 64 again just ification made a way for
[2:35:51] sanctification sanctification made a way
[2:35:53] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost thank
[2:35:55] God thank God thank God it didn't end
[2:35:58] with
[2:35:58] justification because then we would just
[2:36:00] kept repeating the same kind of behavior
[2:36:03] caught in the same trap come on but he
[2:36:06] sent a word and the power of his blood
[2:36:08] to sanctify to set us apart to clean us
[2:36:12] up and then thank God it wasn't just
[2:36:16] that them good old sanctified people
[2:36:19] people of the church age before us they
[2:36:22] walked as clean as they knew how there
[2:36:24] was a remnant of them who are shouting
[2:36:26] the Praises of God in eternity who never
[2:36:29] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:36:31] it wasn't particularly for their
[2:36:33] day but methodism begin to give
[2:36:36] way the wesleyian church Age begin to
[2:36:39] fade the Philadelphian Church Age begin
[2:36:41] to fade and leod deia begin to come the
[2:36:44] most evil of all the ages and yet it was
[2:36:47] in that age that God determined he would
[2:36:49] pour out the very life that was in him
[2:36:52] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost on
[2:36:54] the day of Pentecost Hallelujah and it
[2:36:57] was the restoration of the Holy Ghost in
[2:37:00] 1906 isusa street I'm so thankful for it
[2:37:03] he said the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:37:05] Made A Way listen I'm going to start
[2:37:06] over justification made away for
[2:37:09] sanctification sanctification made way
[2:37:11] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[2:37:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for
[2:37:15] the Holy Ghost itself
[2:37:19] to come right down in
[2:37:23] Perfection back to the word
[2:37:26] again back to the word
[2:37:29] again back to the word again what was
[2:37:31] the message for leod deia back to the
[2:37:34] word again come out of Babylon and get
[2:37:38] back to the word again come back out of
[2:37:40] denominational system and get back to
[2:37:42] the word again come on come out of your
[2:37:44] Creed and back to the
[2:37:47] word come out of your confus ion of who
[2:37:50] God is and how many
[2:37:53] people and your church
[2:37:55] baptism and come back to the word it had
[2:37:59] to be this way justification first
[2:38:01] sanctification then and then the baptism
[2:38:04] of the Holy Ghost making way for the
[2:38:05] perfect word not just to be preached to
[2:38:07] us but to come and live inside of us are
[2:38:10] you here this is that perfect word
[2:38:12] living on the
[2:38:14] inside now let's listen to what John
[2:38:16] Wesley said in closing
[2:38:20] about Genesis
[2:38:21] 4:4 this is from John Wesley's notes on
[2:38:24] the
[2:38:25] Bible and the Lord God had respect to
[2:38:28] Abel and to his offering and showed his
[2:38:31] acceptance of it
[2:38:34] probably by fire from
[2:38:37] heaven but to Cain and to his offering
[2:38:41] he had not respect we are sure there was
[2:38:44] a good reason for that this difference
[2:38:47] now watch this this this wording is
[2:38:49] remember he lived in
[2:38:52] 1700s the governor of the
[2:38:55] world though an absolute
[2:38:59] Sovereign that's who he is King of
[2:39:03] Kings melik ham King of the whole
[2:39:06] universe king of all Kings he's an
[2:39:09] absolute Sovereign doth not
[2:39:12] act maybe maybe next Sunday I shall
[2:39:15] preach in Old English
[2:39:20] though an absolute Sovereign doth not
[2:39:24] act
[2:39:25] arbitrarily in
[2:39:27] dispensing his smiles and
[2:39:32] frowns it must not take much to Thrill
[2:39:36] Me I jumped up out of my chair when I
[2:39:39] read
[2:39:39] it I said in
[2:39:43] 1700 in language I have to concentrate
[2:39:46] on to understand John Wesley the
[2:39:49] messenger that God used for the
[2:39:51] Philadelphian Church age simply said
[2:39:54] this God though he's king of kings and
[2:39:57] Lord of lords the governor of the whole
[2:40:00] world he does not carelessly
[2:40:06] smile when there's nothing to smile at
[2:40:10] right and when he frowns he
[2:40:13] frowns for a
[2:40:15] reason you get
[2:40:17] it and the upon Abel he had respect for
[2:40:21] his offering but under Cain he had no
[2:40:24] respect God Smiled On Abel not because
[2:40:27] he loved Abel more than
[2:40:31] Cain but simply
[2:40:33] because Abel came with a
[2:40:35] revelation Cain came with a religious
[2:40:40] spirit you hear are you hearing me God
[2:40:45] does not arbitrarily act dispensing his
[2:40:49] smiles and
[2:40:53] frowns you read enough of that and
[2:40:55] you'll be glad to go back to Kentucky
[2:40:58] English but it means something to us a
[2:41:01] man by the name of Joseph Benson give me
[2:41:03] a moment he lived 1748 to 1821 he was a
[2:41:08] Methodist Minister he was a contemporary
[2:41:10] of John Wesley that means he lived in
[2:41:12] the same time he actually lived longer
[2:41:14] but he lived in the same time of John
[2:41:17] Wesley he was born in Cumberland England
[2:41:20] and became a Methodist at age 16 now I
[2:41:23] only left that in the note simply
[2:41:24] because he became dedicated to his faith
[2:41:27] at an early
[2:41:29] age that means something he was marked
[2:41:32] for something let's look at just a
[2:41:35] moment how he looked at Genesis 4:4 and
[2:41:39] the Lord God had respect to Abel and to
[2:41:41] his offering and showed his acceptance
[2:41:43] of it probably by fire from heaven but
[2:41:47] to Cain and his offering
[2:41:50] he had
[2:41:51] no
[2:41:54] respect
[2:41:57] none it means
[2:42:01] something now if you think that
[2:42:04] God is going to smile on you because of
[2:42:08] where you went to
[2:42:12] church or what you have on your shelf in
[2:42:14] your
[2:42:16] home you've missed it
[2:42:20] that's not the way it works he's looking
[2:42:23] at your
[2:42:24] offering I'm closing with this I really
[2:42:26] am 1952 I'm skipping I hope you can find
[2:42:30] it 1952 God's way that's been made for
[2:42:33] us I want to read this one he said now I
[2:42:36] want you to notice he found himself
[2:42:39] trying to make his
[2:42:41] way we had this morning how Cain tried
[2:42:44] to make his way there are probably
[2:42:47] people among us and people that we love
[2:42:49] and people that we know people that we
[2:42:51] work with and people that are in our
[2:42:53] family who are trying to make their
[2:42:56] way but it's not
[2:42:59] enough it's just simply not
[2:43:02] enough when someone says I'm doing the
[2:43:04] best I can the refrain from Heaven would
[2:43:07] would almost always be it's not
[2:43:11] enough because normally when we think
[2:43:13] we're doing the best we can we haven't
[2:43:15] even beg to scratch the surface
[2:43:20] if we still have more time for Netflix
[2:43:22] than we do for the word we cannot say
[2:43:25] we've tried our
[2:43:27] best if we spend more time talking about
[2:43:29] one another than we do
[2:43:31] praying I'm just preaching just doing my
[2:43:35] job if we get more excited when we're
[2:43:38] spreading some rumor about somebody than
[2:43:41] we do about the great message that God
[2:43:43] is sent to capture Us in this hour we
[2:43:45] haven't done the best we can do
[2:43:50] amen that's in love I'm telling you it's
[2:43:53] all been in love it
[2:43:56] has now I want you to notice he found
[2:43:58] something trying to make his way how
[2:44:00] Cain tried he brought down some apples
[2:44:02] and pears and peaches well nobody know
[2:44:04] and pumpkins ever what it
[2:44:07] was do you see that phrase I'm not
[2:44:10] trying to be ridiculous but do you see
[2:44:12] that phrase ever what it
[2:44:14] was do you do you understand there's no
[2:44:17] Doctrine being made here it wasn't
[2:44:19] necessarily apples and peaches and pears
[2:44:23] and
[2:44:24] pumpkins he said ever what it was he's
[2:44:27] trying to give us something as an
[2:44:29] example you you'd be surprised at the
[2:44:31] folks I know who want to make a Doctrine
[2:44:33] over something like that that's why we
[2:44:37] have to treat this message like we do
[2:44:38] everything else that God has given us we
[2:44:41] take it back to the absolute of the word
[2:44:43] don't get up and try to say if somebody
[2:44:45] said it was a cabbage bless God the
[2:44:48] prophet said it was apples pears peaches
[2:44:50] and pumpkins he said ever what it
[2:44:53] was he laid it upon the altar I don't
[2:44:57] have to say that for folks here but I
[2:44:59] have to say that for some of our other
[2:45:01] precious lovely streamers and
[2:45:04] Friends everybody was laid it on an
[2:45:07] altar and said now there Lord I built an
[2:45:09] altar I built a church but a sign on the
[2:45:13] door he could have said I'm a good
[2:45:15] church member
[2:45:16] see I go to church every day I come here
[2:45:19] built the altar I put the sacrifice upon
[2:45:21] it now I'm going to kneel down and pray
[2:45:24] and now Lord I want you to receive
[2:45:37] me somebody said just pray just build an
[2:45:41] altar just tell God you love
[2:45:46] him that's L to see in theology
[2:45:49] that's church anity that's not Bible
[2:45:52] religion that's not Bible word that
[2:45:54] that's not the truth it sounds so lovely
[2:45:57] just go to church just pay your tithe
[2:45:59] just love everybody just include
[2:46:01] everybody just be tolerant of everybody
[2:46:04] you know all churches all churches lead
[2:46:06] to God you know Oprah Winfrey
[2:46:10] religion all faiths lead to Heaven
[2:46:12] you're going to be
[2:46:15] shocked you're you're going to be
[2:46:17] shocked I I doubt doubt there's very
[2:46:19] many in this room that have ever been to
[2:46:21] a funeral where the preacher just
[2:46:22] honestly got up and said I have no
[2:46:25] idea I've done it
[2:46:28] twice I have no
[2:46:31] idea I would love to stand here and tell
[2:46:34] you that he made a end that he called on
[2:46:38] the Lord but since I don't know whether
[2:46:40] he did or not I have to tell you the
[2:46:42] brutal
[2:46:43] truth you may or may not see her you may
[2:46:46] or may not see him but you've got to
[2:46:49] make
[2:46:51] it the reality is if you get there and
[2:46:54] he didn't you get there and she didn't
[2:46:57] you'll never even be
[2:46:59] concerned about their
[2:47:02] absence if you think that heaven is
[2:47:05] going to be a bunch of granny's sitting
[2:47:06] in rocking chairs crying because they
[2:47:08] had grandchildren or children that
[2:47:09] didn't make
[2:47:10] it that sounds like the church it
[2:47:12] doesn't sound like the word Granny's
[2:47:15] going to run if granny makes it she's
[2:47:16] running all over Heaven Hallelujah
[2:47:19] huah Hallelujah she don't have
[2:47:23] time somebody said well I thought you
[2:47:25] said sometime they're interceding for
[2:47:26] their loved ones they are but they don't
[2:47:28] always know the brutal
[2:47:30] reality because if they did that
[2:47:32] wouldn't be Heaven would
[2:47:35] it how could anybody enjoy that place
[2:47:39] that the redeemed are resting and
[2:47:40] waiting on us how could anybody enjoy
[2:47:43] that if they were overly worried and
[2:47:45] concerned and torn and broken over over
[2:47:48] their own family and the way they're
[2:47:50] doing and how could anyone live in
[2:47:53] eternity worshiping the Lord and being
[2:47:54] happy knowing that they had a child on
[2:47:57] Earth that didn't make it a grandchild
[2:47:59] that didn't make it listen folks
[2:48:00] families are going to be
[2:48:02] separated and everybody that that is
[2:48:04] born to a woman is not going to be given
[2:48:06] eternal life just because they ran the
[2:48:10] race that is that is woke
[2:48:13] 2025 Society you don't have to win the
[2:48:16] race you just run the race and you get
[2:48:18] the ribbon anyway way that's not God's
[2:48:21] race the ribbon doesn't go the prize
[2:48:24] doesn't go to the
[2:48:26] participant the prize goes to every
[2:48:28] person that runs over the
[2:48:30] line somebody said you mean not just the
[2:48:32] first one doesn't matter the
[2:48:34] order God's not looking to see who comes
[2:48:37] first he's just looking for you to go
[2:48:39] all the way that's right tell yourself
[2:48:41] right now with God's help I've got to go
[2:48:42] all the
[2:48:43] way I don't want to be political here
[2:48:47] but I heard uh
[2:48:49] Pete say this week our our new secretary
[2:48:52] of
[2:48:54] defense I heard him
[2:48:56] say yes that was the Life I
[2:49:01] Lived some of those things I did and
[2:49:05] some of those things I'm guilty of but
[2:49:08] that was the old
[2:49:09] me somebody said it's easy to say yeah
[2:49:12] you you can always say I turned over a
[2:49:13] new Leaf but I'll tell you what's not
[2:49:15] easy to say to the whole world to those
[2:49:18] those Heathen Congressman sitting there
[2:49:20] some of them
[2:49:22] atheist some of them
[2:49:24] Mormons some of them
[2:49:26] Catholic who think that it can all be
[2:49:29] taken care of by lighting a candle and
[2:49:30] praying a little prayer but to stand
[2:49:33] before them sit before them and say to
[2:49:34] all of them but because of Jesus and
[2:49:37] Jenny isn't that her
[2:49:39] name I'm I'm I am what I am today my
[2:49:43] wife it's because of the Lord Jesus
[2:49:45] Christ who saved me
[2:49:49] so they swore him into office
[2:49:51] yesterday the vice president I'm not
[2:49:55] being political he is the vice president
[2:49:57] right the
[2:50:01] hillbilly the one who as a young
[2:50:03] teenager jumped out of the
[2:50:05] automobile to save his life from his
[2:50:08] mother who was a a crazy alcoholic and
[2:50:11] drug
[2:50:13] addict one of the most beautiful
[2:50:15] pictures of redemption this is not
[2:50:16] political
[2:50:18] is the is the scene of him standing
[2:50:21] there taking the oath of office as Vice
[2:50:23] President of the United States and those
[2:50:26] women who are standing up on that
[2:50:28] platform uh uh our our first lady there
[2:50:31] is no
[2:50:33] telling how much that dress
[2:50:38] cost it it was probably in the
[2:50:40] neighborhood of your
[2:50:42] automobile I'm so thankful that she
[2:50:44] didn't look like a
[2:50:46] hoochie and she rep and she she didn't
[2:50:48] have on a pants
[2:50:51] suit but she represented herself as a
[2:50:54] lady maybe not the standard you and I
[2:50:56] appreciate but I I appreciated the fact
[2:50:59] that she looked like a
[2:51:02] lady and then one of
[2:51:05] these businessman with
[2:51:08] his poochie mama with him you know
[2:51:10] standing right up there her her chest
[2:51:13] exposed for the whole world to see what
[2:51:15] what a shame somebody ought to took a
[2:51:17] crook and stick and and took her right
[2:51:20] off the
[2:51:22] stage but there stood a
[2:51:26] mother in a simple
[2:51:28] outfit someone
[2:51:30] said it looked perhaps maybe like TJ
[2:51:34] Maxx well that's where my family
[2:51:36] dresses so that's where you and I would
[2:51:38] fit in here this where we would be we
[2:51:40] wouldn't be in melania's
[2:51:44] closet we'd be at TJ Max
[2:51:50] I got on TJ Max sock right
[2:51:54] now someone said there stood the vice
[2:51:58] president's
[2:51:59] mother his wife is standing beside him
[2:52:02] not telling the money I suppose her
[2:52:09] shoes cost more than to take every one
[2:52:12] of us out to eat today I don't begrudge
[2:52:15] her that I'm glad she had them glad she
[2:52:16] could get them if there's not even a
[2:52:20] hair of jealousy in
[2:52:23] me but then his mother was standing
[2:52:26] there in just a simple red top of I
[2:52:29] guess it was a skirt I didn't really see
[2:52:32] beneath so
[2:52:35] simple a but a work of Grace a woman who
[2:52:39] should have been
[2:52:42] dead but a curing
[2:52:46] granny told him you don't have to live
[2:52:48] live your
[2:52:49] life like ours has been
[2:52:53] lived you can make a difference so he's
[2:52:56] being sworn in Vice President of the
[2:52:58] United States his wife standing beside
[2:52:59] him and and and and his mother standing
[2:53:02] here watching
[2:53:06] on I heard her I saw her and and and
[2:53:09] heard a word from her at the
[2:53:11] convention a republican convention this
[2:53:14] year and I thought to myself how many
[2:53:16] men would would have been embarrassed
[2:53:19] and how many women like her would have
[2:53:21] been embarrassed to go and face that
[2:53:23] crowd of people with her story I haven't
[2:53:26] seen a film but a film was made a book
[2:53:28] was written a best-selling book about
[2:53:30] her
[2:53:32] rottenness you'd think she'd be hiding
[2:53:34] in the wing somewhere but she faced all
[2:53:37] of that to show a life can be changed
[2:53:41] come on come on a life can be changed
[2:53:45] and when when uh Pete Reed took the AU
[2:53:48] of office
[2:53:49] yesterday he comes to the microphone to
[2:53:51] say his word all of this is because of
[2:53:54] the Saving Grace of the Lord Jesus
[2:53:57] Christ that's why I can stand here today
[2:54:00] oh my it was so refresh I'm not being
[2:54:03] political but it was so refreshing to
[2:54:06] me that someone could not only say the
[2:54:09] higher
[2:54:11] power I was thankful for a prayer that
[2:54:15] could actually be prayed out loud in in
[2:54:18] the name of the Lord Jesus in the name
[2:54:21] of Jesus Christ we pray how wonderful it
[2:54:26] is to think that there is an opportunity
[2:54:29] for his grace to be magnified and his
[2:54:32] power to deliver to be magnified they
[2:54:34] may not know what you know but they're
[2:54:37] serving their purpose here on
[2:54:39] Earth may God give them strength to
[2:54:41] continue to do it Cain tried to make
[2:54:44] I've got a musicians are coming he
[2:54:46] brought apples and pears and peaches and
[2:54:48] pumpkin and I build a church I go to
[2:54:50] church every day I come here and build
[2:54:52] the alar I even buy my coffee and donuts
[2:54:56] from the church on Sunday morning I'm a
[2:54:58] I'm a full
[2:55:01] supporter and I might even get my tattoo
[2:55:03] in the
[2:55:07] back I've given money to order the smoke
[2:55:10] machines and colored lights
[2:55:15] and I'm I'm supporting the church
[2:55:20] I put a sacrifice upon it now I'm going
[2:55:22] to kneel down and pray and now Lord I
[2:55:24] want you to receive me that's Leia DEA
[2:55:26] receive me I'm I'm rich I'm increased
[2:55:30] with Goods I have need of nothing now
[2:55:32] Lord I want you to receive me and God
[2:55:35] said but God refused
[2:55:37] him and that same old religion Spirit
[2:55:39] don't you don't you miss this and that
[2:55:42] same old religious spirit lives right
[2:55:43] down amongst the church today if it did
[2:55:46] in 1952 it does in
[2:55:49] 2025 the very same thing just as
[2:55:52] religious as it can be and knows no more
[2:55:54] about God than the Hut and pot would
[2:55:57] know about an Egyptian
[2:55:58] Knight you know that's a truth he said
[2:56:02] religious
[2:56:04] Spirits don't think that Stalin is the
[2:56:08] Antichrist the Bible said the two
[2:56:10] Spirits would be so close
[2:56:13] together they would deceive the very
[2:56:16] elect if possible
[2:56:19] that religious spirit is alive and well
[2:56:23] today and it will give people just
[2:56:25] enough peace to ease their
[2:56:28] conviction and they'll stand in a church
[2:56:30] on Sunday morning and say God just
[2:56:32] receive me just just take me I've done
[2:56:34] all you I've done all I'm supposed to do
[2:56:36] just take me and receive me and God
[2:56:38] couldn't if he wanted to because why
[2:56:41] because he has a provided way you're
[2:56:44] going to come the provided way or you're
[2:56:45] never
[2:56:46] coming if God doesn't call you you'll
[2:56:49] never come did somebody die today and
[2:56:51] went to hell they did while you were
[2:56:54] sitting here somebody in Lee County died
[2:56:57] and guess what went to
[2:57:00] hell and it doesn't give anybody with
[2:57:03] passion or compassion pleasure to say
[2:57:05] such a thing but the reality is
[2:57:07] everybody doesn't make
[2:57:09] it everybody they may be religious they
[2:57:12] may go to church their name may be on a
[2:57:15] brick they may carry their little box of
[2:57:19] printed tithe envelopes with their name
[2:57:21] on it and they may actually give
[2:57:24] something but God has a provided
[2:57:30] way all of this happened because
[2:57:33] resentment because of Envy because of
[2:57:39] jealousy God even said to
[2:57:42] Cain I'm going to paraphrase allow me
[2:57:45] this you go check it out here's the
[2:57:47] paraphrase you didn't do so
[2:57:49] well if you'd have just done the right
[2:57:51] thing if you just bring the right
[2:57:54] offering it almost sounded like I'm just
[2:57:57] paraphrasing it almost sounded like God
[2:57:59] was saying you messed up but you you you
[2:58:01] can do better about this I'm just saying
[2:58:03] what it sounded
[2:58:05] like but
[2:58:07] instead he let a
[2:58:10] wound he he his countenance fell he got
[2:58:13] mad he got mad I got so mad
[2:58:18] his countenance fell he's so
[2:58:22] upset he tries to talk it over with
[2:58:25] Abel and Abel is just caught away in an
[2:58:30] inspiration of what God showed
[2:58:33] him perhaps he just took his arm and put
[2:58:36] around his brother and said now
[2:58:37] brother God has a provided way let let
[2:58:41] me talk to you just a little bit it had
[2:58:43] to be
[2:58:45] blood it had to be blood sin came by
[2:58:47] Blood blood original sin came by Blood
[2:58:51] covering for sin comes by the blood and
[2:58:53] eventually full Redemption comes by the
[2:58:55] blood you saw that little lamb I offered
[2:58:59] Millions just like him are going to
[2:59:03] die throughout the Covenant of of of of
[2:59:06] Torah or law or
[2:59:08] instruction millions are going to die
[2:59:10] just like that one blood's going to be
[2:59:12] shed fire just like you saw is going to
[2:59:16] fall and and and light The
[2:59:19] Altar and then one
[2:59:22] day another lamb is coming he may be
[2:59:26] sitting here just trying to talk it over
[2:59:28] with with Cain and Cain is trying to
[2:59:30] hear it but Cain is so
[2:59:32] mad don't talk to me about that can you
[2:59:36] imagine I'm so mad I can't hear all that
[2:59:40] I I've got real world
[2:59:43] problems can you imagine his rejection
[2:59:46] so all the Talking is said they talked
[2:59:48] it over in the field or they talk it
[2:59:50] over and later in the
[2:59:53] field and none of that could help Cain
[2:59:57] get over the
[3:00:00] offense and so everything that would
[3:00:02] have happened from then on the rest of
[3:00:05] those twin brothers lives would have
[3:00:07] been filtered through Cain's hurt
[3:00:09] feelings his jealousy his
[3:00:13] Envy Cain would have not have been able
[3:00:16] hear me play something softly ve very
[3:00:23] soft Cain would have never been able to
[3:00:27] cheer for Abel's
[3:00:31] children when they want to
[3:00:36] raise he would have not seen the child
[3:00:38] for the
[3:00:40] child he would have seen
[3:00:43] Cain it's a stinking image of his daddy
[3:00:46] I don't want anything to do with him
[3:00:48] come on this is what resentment does it
[3:00:50] starts off a hurt a wound a legitimate
[3:00:52] one perhaps even at times and then it
[3:00:54] starts rolling like a snowball down the
[3:00:56] hill getting larger and larger as it
[3:00:58] goes and it it filters
[3:01:02] everything Abel would have gotten the
[3:01:04] most beautiful wife and Cain would have
[3:01:05] had the
[3:01:07] leftovers that would have been Cain's
[3:01:10] outlook on the
[3:01:16] future if Cain would have continued to
[3:01:19] live and he would had a wife and his
[3:01:21] wife would have had a
[3:01:22] miscarriage what would that have done it
[3:01:24] would have just deepened the wound
[3:01:26] because he had to look over there and
[3:01:27] see Abel's Wife Carrying a child full
[3:01:30] term it gets bigger this could go on all
[3:01:32] day I could I could take this I could
[3:01:34] take this thought all day
[3:01:39] long Cain if we brought him into into
[3:01:42] today's society
[3:01:44] and I can't even pay the repair bill
[3:01:47] Cain would say I can't even pay the
[3:01:50] repair Bill to keep my jalape going down
[3:01:52] the road and every time I turn around
[3:01:55] Abel's Trad in his for a newer
[3:01:58] model everything that happened in the
[3:02:00] lives of those brothers would have been
[3:02:04] filtered through that spirit of
[3:02:09] offense and it would not have remain
[3:02:12] just between Cain and
[3:02:14] Abel because a wounded Spirit sees
[3:02:16] everybody
[3:02:20] in the
[3:02:22] wrong and connections would be
[3:02:25] made and every time Cain went to church
[3:02:28] the preacher was preaching right at
[3:02:31] him and every time Cain did
[3:02:35] this and that happened it was because
[3:02:40] of
[3:02:42] Abel and it goes on and on and on and on
[3:02:45] and you blame the wrong people at the
[3:02:46] wrong time
[3:02:48] because the reality is more painful than
[3:02:52] your
[3:02:53] fantasy if you saw the reality you would
[3:02:56] have to see your
[3:02:57] part and
[3:02:59] nobody except God's children want to see
[3:03:02] their part and so Cain did what he felt
[3:03:05] he had to
[3:03:07] do I've got to put an end to this I
[3:03:10] can't live in the shadow of
[3:03:12] Able Fire came and fell I I didn't even
[3:03:15] get a fizzle
[3:03:18] I didn't even get a whiff of
[3:03:21] smoke and it'll be that way my whole
[3:03:24] life I I'll always be the tail and not
[3:03:27] the head the only way I'll ever become
[3:03:29] the
[3:03:30] head is to kill my brother and while
[3:03:33] they were in the field he rose up in
[3:03:34] anger and and murdered his brother the
[3:03:37] first
[3:03:39] murderer because the Old Testament
[3:03:42] teaches us the difference between
[3:03:43] killing and
[3:03:44] murder he he he committed murder
[3:03:48] and guess what God still wouldn't have
[3:03:50] him God still wouldn't show him pleasure
[3:03:53] and God said no no no no no no you still
[3:03:57] won't lead you still won't be righteous
[3:03:59] before me because that thing is still in
[3:04:02] your life I'll raise up another
[3:04:06] seed I'll replace you again come on it's
[3:04:10] hard
[3:04:11] reality but I'll raise up another one
[3:04:13] I'll call his name will be Seth that's
[3:04:16] right and he'll lead a righteous line of
[3:04:20] my
[3:04:21] children because resentment never works
[3:04:24] it never wins it cannot be rewarded Envy
[3:04:28] can't be rewarded jealousy can't be
[3:04:30] rewarded you can't tiptoe around
[3:04:33] jealousy you can't temp toe around Envy
[3:04:36] you can't temp toe around
[3:04:39] offense you'll live the rest of your
[3:04:41] life like a little dog in a sideshow
[3:04:43] trying to jump through all the hoops and
[3:04:45] come on it won't work trying to please
[3:04:48] somebody that has a spirit of
[3:04:51] offense and the only
[3:04:54] remedy is to let that sword of the Lord
[3:04:59] come if it was Daddy Let The Sword come
[3:05:02] if it was mama let the sword come if it
[3:05:04] was Pastor let the sword come if it was
[3:05:07] your child your son your daughter let
[3:05:09] the sword come if it was your
[3:05:14] spouse let the sword come that offence
[3:05:18] out Let It
[3:05:21] Go but when you
[3:05:24] do it'll change a lot of
[3:05:28] things when we finally get shed rid you
[3:05:32] you all know Southern
[3:05:34] vernacular you know what I mean when I
[3:05:36] said we get shed of that get rid of that
[3:05:39] when we get rid of that it'll change the
[3:05:42] way we
[3:05:43] think and the way we live and the way we
[3:05:45] worship and the way we move among God's
[3:05:47] people
[3:05:48] people because jealousy will be gone and
[3:05:51] you'll never see it as a competition
[3:05:52] anymore one being lifted up while
[3:05:54] another one is being pulled down you'll
[3:05:56] just understand that it's just iron
[3:05:58] sharpening iron it has to happen has to
[3:06:01] come and if two can't walk together
[3:06:04] because they're not agreed let them find
[3:06:05] another place to walk but walk on for
[3:06:09] God Paul and Deus had to do it Paul and
[3:06:12] Barnabas had some the the disciples had
[3:06:15] some issues
[3:06:18] brother brandom and Gordon Lindsay had
[3:06:19] issues they had to go one go one way one
[3:06:21] or another Graham Snelling the assistant
[3:06:23] pastor at the brandom Tabernacle they
[3:06:25] had some issues he had to go one way and
[3:06:26] brother randman had to go
[3:06:30] another brother Junior Jackson didn't
[3:06:33] Embrace Church order the way brother
[3:06:35] Brandon was presenting it at the
[3:06:37] Tabernacle so he pulls
[3:06:40] away and the people were making fun of
[3:06:42] brother Jackson the T Tabernacle people
[3:06:45] making fun of them and saying you know
[3:06:47] calling them silly
[3:06:49] names because they didn't believe in the
[3:06:51] same kind of church order that brandom
[3:06:53] Tabernacle
[3:06:54] came and brother brandom rebuked them
[3:06:56] and said Why That's my brother he
[3:06:58] believes this message as much as anybody
[3:07:00] don't ever say that again that's his
[3:07:02] church it's Sovereign let them do what
[3:07:03] they will in 1965 when brother brandham
[3:07:06] died do you know what happened does
[3:07:08] anybody know what happened to the
[3:07:09] Tabernacle in 1965 those original
[3:07:13] people that had been
[3:07:16] rebuked because they made fun of brother
[3:07:18] Jackson Almost 100% of them left the
[3:07:22] Tabernacle over the course of a few
[3:07:24] months and guess where they
[3:07:27] went to Brother Junior
[3:07:30] Jackson's why does that matter it
[3:07:32] matters
[3:07:34] because one thing can shift your whole
[3:07:37] thought
[3:07:38] process when what you're holding on to
[3:07:41] is no longer there to hold on to
[3:07:46] it and that's when brother Collins and
[3:07:48] others stepped up and they wanted to
[3:07:50] make sure that not only at the
[3:07:52] Tabernacle but around the world they
[3:07:54] enforced this strong stand on how the
[3:07:59] spirit should move and how it shouldn't
[3:08:00] move and what should be done and what
[3:08:02] shouldn't be done and there was a fence
[3:08:05] that took
[3:08:06] place and brother Brandon was no longer
[3:08:08] there to pull it together and the the
[3:08:12] rift gets wider and wider folks we
[3:08:15] better let the Holy Spirit Come Today
[3:08:18] right yes let's
[3:08:21] stand I know I took more time than I
[3:08:23] should have it will

[3:17:27] [Music]
[3:17:29] sail oh but I have a friend who watches
[3:17:36] over
[3:17:37] me when the breeze turns in to
[3:17:44] again
[3:17:45] oh I know the master of the
[3:17:51] wind
[3:17:53] oh I know the maker of the
[3:17:59] rain oh he can calm your storm and make
[3:18:04] the sun to shine
[3:18:08] again I know the master of the
[3:18:15] wind and
[3:18:17] sometimes I
[3:18:18] soar like an eagle to the
[3:18:22] sky among the Peaks my soul can be
[3:18:29] found oh but an unexpected storm may
[3:18:34] derive me from the
[3:18:37] height it brings me low but it cannot
[3:18:41] bring me
[3:18:42] down
[3:18:45] oh I know know the master of the
[3:18:50] wind
[3:18:52] oh I know the maker of the
[3:18:59] rain he can calm your storm and make the
[3:19:03] sun shine
[3:19:06] again I know I know the master
[3:19:12] of Lord Jesus we want you to pour in
[3:19:16] some oil
[3:19:17] and some wine in our
[3:19:21] lives the old song said they from the
[3:19:25] scripture he
[3:19:26] found him bleeding and dying on the
[3:19:30] Jericho
[3:19:32] Road the Good Samaritan poured in the
[3:19:35] oil and he poured in the wine Lord you
[3:19:38] have found us many many
[3:19:42] times beating and bleeding on the side
[3:19:45] of the road
[3:19:47] from the
[3:19:48] hurts and Brokenness of
[3:19:51] life but like the Good Samaritan that
[3:19:54] you are you have always been there to
[3:19:57] pour in the oil and the wine and I'm
[3:19:59] asking you again
[3:20:02] today where there is a need would you
[3:20:06] pour in oil would you pour in
[3:20:09] wine would you raise us
[3:20:13] above would you give us strength and
[3:20:16] Grace to run
[3:20:18] on would you help us to turn loose of
[3:20:22] the thing that we may be holding on
[3:20:25] to father would you birth in us a new
[3:20:32] willingness and a new Grace to
[3:20:35] forgive Lord you have forgiven
[3:20:38] me you have forgiven us of so
[3:20:42] much Lord let it be easier for us to
[3:20:46] forgive
[3:20:47] to shed the experiences of life that are
[3:20:51] negative like a duck would shed water
[3:20:55] let it roll off of us as we step up into
[3:20:59] the stature of the perfect man we're
[3:21:03] making room in our life for Christ to be
[3:21:07] formed come
[3:21:10] Jesus and manifest yourself in us come
[3:21:16] and give us that hope of glory as you
[3:21:19] form yourself in
[3:21:22] us there may be those today who have
[3:21:26] never really known you by
[3:21:30] relationship they've known you by Church
[3:21:34] Association but they're hearing
[3:21:37] something that calls them to a
[3:21:41] fellowship to a relationship with you
[3:21:45] grant it to today that they would be
[3:21:48] willing to make room for you to come and
[3:21:51] take your
[3:21:52] Abode that you would sit on the throne
[3:21:56] the control tower of our life and you
[3:21:59] would be the filter you would help us to
[3:22:03] reject those things that are not of
[3:22:07] Truth
[3:22:08] and therefore are error and help us to
[3:22:14] receive the spirit of Truth

[3:22:18] lives oh God this bride is stepping
[3:22:24] forward in this last hour we've climbed
[3:22:28] some rough mountains we've come up some
[3:22:31] rough places but we can almost smell
[3:22:37] Victory I really
[3:22:40] believe that
[3:22:41] Overcomers are rising among us even in

[3:23:17] of the Lord be upon each one of us may
[3:23:21] we not move forward in self-confidence

[3:23:27] and the confidence of the king of kings
[3:23:30] oh and the Lord of
[3:23:33] lords we're believing that the Joshua
[3:23:36] generation is rising
[3:23:40] up and that she will go all the
[3:23:44] way she will not not be
[3:23:47] satisfied to stay where she
[3:23:50] is Lord you
[3:23:53] promised that young people would catch
[3:23:57] the
[3:23:58] Baton and take us
