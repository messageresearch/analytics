Description:
Divine love does not treat others as they deserve to be treated or loved, expressing that kind of love means we love unconditionally, that kind of love is to our own hurting.  That kind of love is costly in all relationships.  It’s painful in spousal or parental relationships, in courtship.  But don’t let the enemy talk you out of that concept.  Love is worth it.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he beautifies the meek with salvation and the word salvation is Yeshua say it with me Yeshua and that's the Hebrew name of the Lord Jesus Christ so the scriptures really say he would beautify the meek with himself it's Jesus that shines out of your countenance it's Jesus that makes you light it's Jesus that causes you to be bright and the direct results of having received his light is you receive love and you don't only receive love you're not just a taker of love you're a giver of love and by this shall all men know that you are my disciples by this shall all men know that you have passed from Death unto life that you will have love one for another we've got to have it did somebody hear me we've got to have that kind of love it's in US you can't be saved and not have that kind of love Jesus brings it when he moves in but it's the giving you might remember the story of how a friend of ours had an experience with this whole scenario of did you learn to love can you imagine standing waiting to be escorted into the presence of God in eternity and having the question asked not did you dress right [Music] not did you believe right not did you go to the right church but can you imagine being asked did you learn to love someone answered and said Lord I loved you but I never learned to love your people now how many of you know there's something wrong I happen to believe that that experience was real and I happen to believe that it stands as a stark reminder to us today that we can get all the doctrines right we can know exactly where to send somebody in the tape but until we can learn to love an unconditional love a love that's not based on someone's treatment toward you the Bible doesn't teach us to treat others as as they deserve to be treated or love others only if they deserve to be loved but it tells us that we should do unto others as we would have them to do unto us not as they do so we're doing right and we're doing good and we're expressing love even if it hurts how many of you know Love Hurts love is costly in all kinds of relationships in Parental relationship and love a spousal and and courtship and it's painful love is painful but let me tell you don't let the enemy talk you out of the concept it's worth it it's worth it the gift to be able to love someone the gift to be able to receive love from someone is priceless and nobody should be loving like the Bride of Jesus Christ we should have the greatest measure of love one toward the other
