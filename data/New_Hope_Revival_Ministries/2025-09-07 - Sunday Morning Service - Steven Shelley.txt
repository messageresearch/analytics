And he's holding out his hands. But the waves are calling out my name and they laugh at me. Oh, they reminded me of all the times I've tried before and failed. And the waves they keep on telling me time and time again, "Boy, you'll never win." No, you'll never win. Oh, but the voice of truth tells me a different story. The voice of truth says, "Do not be afraid. And the voice of truth, it says, "This is for my glory. Out of all the voices calling out to me, oh, I will choose to listen and believe the voice of truth."

[Music] And know what I would do to have the kind of strength it takes to stand before a giant with just a sling and a stone. All surrounded by the sound of a thousand warriors. Just a shaking in their armor and wishing they'd have had the strength to stand. But the giant's calling out my name. And he laughs at me. Oh, he's just reminding me of all the times I've tried before and failed. And the giant keeps on telling me, "Oh, time and time again, boy, you'll never win. No, you'll never win."

When you picked me up out of the place that I was, you set my feet on a solid foundation. the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, I bless you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I bless you, Lord. [Music] You took me out of darkness and you placed me in your marvelous light. [Music] Because of your grace, Lord, you have continued to deliver me out of my darkness.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The light of life does shine through me in me. The very life of Jesus come back on the believer. Thank you Lord. Oh what a marvelous revelation that he has given us in the end time. &gt;&gt; Amen. to bring us to complete deliverance. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. As we go to prayer today, do you have a need just by lifting your hand? I have a need in my heart and I need the Lord to move on my behalf. And he does. He will. Out across the stream, the Lord sees the need that you have. request was put in for Sister Sherry Farmer's brother-in-law, Brother Marty Mccomomas, a pastor of a small church in Arkansas. He's in need of the healing touch of the Lord, a miracle. Let's ask the Lord to do that for him. Brother Farmer is preaching there today. We want to ask the Lord to help him. Sister Kathy is not well today. We want to remember her and ask the Lord to minister to her. strep throat. They wanted to ask us to pray and Samantha asked that we pray that the Lord would make a way that they could could be more often here. We would like to see that for sure. &gt;&gt; Sister Isabelle Williams is at home today and she needs the strength of the Lord &gt;&gt; and she needs God's perfect healing in her body. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. and uh she had a doctor's report this week from the emergency room that uh there was something going on in in uh like a mass or something like that. But uh it could be many things and God knows exactly what it is. And we're believing that she will fight with her faith. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And that we'll fight with her with our faith and that God will give a miracle. He's a miracle working God. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; I remember my grandmother telling the doctor I was there. She took a few radiation treatments after the surgery that discovered the cancer in her lungs. And I remember the doctor her telling the doctor uh I can't do any more of this because it's burning me up. I feel like I'm burning from the inside out and I can't take any more of these treatments. remember she had gone almost 40 years without an aspirin so any medicine affected her but of course she the radiation was more than she could take and he said well you won't live but a very short time and she said well thank you for your professional opinion I I respected her I wouldn't be here but she said you don't get to tell me when to die &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; she said my creator Peter &gt;&gt; will tell me when to die and I won't die until he tells me till he calls me. &gt;&gt; And uh she said I don't mean to be obstinate but she said I don't expect to go anywhere for for some time. And she didn't. &gt;&gt; God gave her a lot of victory and a lot of healing &gt;&gt; until she could kind of finish some things. There were still some people that she needed to talk to about this message &gt;&gt; that had criticized it to her and she was so young just beginning to learn what we would share with her and listening to the tapes herself. She didn't stand up for it like she thought she should have. And so she said, "I'd like to live long enough to stand up &gt;&gt; to defend what I know God has done." &gt;&gt; That really helped me. It really touched my life. Let's believe for brother Bobby words also that God will give it. He is undergoing lots of treatment and it weakens his body but we believe that God is more than able &gt;&gt; uh to do exceedingly and abundantly above and know I know there's unspoken request. I have a little sister on my heart today that God sees her need and I'd like for the Lord to move on her behalf. Yes, &gt;&gt; she's weary in mind and body. But God is more than a healer. &gt;&gt; He's a creator. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; He is a miracle working God. &gt;&gt; My Lord and my God. &gt;&gt; I worship you. You are great and you are the God of miracles. As you did yesterday, you still do today and you will do tomorrow. You are God of miracles and I thank you Lord for every miracle you let my eye behold. I thank you for the miracle of salvation and the miracle of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that you gave to me. Lord, it was not something that man could give to an individual. Man cannot save and man cannot baptize in the Holy Ghost. That is from your hand, Lord. And we thank you for it. We thank you for ears to hear that we've been able to hear a message in the end time. We thank you for a voice that you have placed among us that would deliver this truth without fear or without favor of men. I bless him and thank you that you have placed him among us. Oh Lord, would you strengthen him even as he would step behind this desk today? I pray God that our ears would be tuned to heaven's frequency and that we would not be distracted by earth's frequency. I ask you, oh Lord, that you would come by the power of your resurrection and raise us up into heavenly places in Christ Jesus today. Lord, I thank you that you have already placed angels around this room. You have commissioned them among us today. And because we believe that we are living under an open heaven, we thank you that they are ascending and descending in our midst today, bringing treasures from the treasury room of heaven. I thank you, oh God, that you heard the requests that were made known among us today. many healings that are needed, miracles that are needed. But again, I thank you that you are the God of miracles. And so we just decree the miracle working power of God for brother Marty, for sister Williams, for Sister Kathy, for Jameson, for Sister Williams. Lord, we believe that that's who you are. Oh Lord, I thank you that you're ministering miracle to brother Bobby WZ. Oh God, anyone among us that needs a miracle today, not just in a physical healing, but Lord, there's some struggling in their minds. And I pray God that you would deliver that miracle today. That the darkness that has tried to invade their territory would be put in its place in the name of Jesus Christ. Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; that darkness is invasive. &gt;&gt; But God, you are God of light. It is not. That darkness is not from you. That darkness is from the underworld. And so we take authority in the name of Jesus Christ. And we confess the light, the glorious light of the Lord Jesus Christ to come and minister to these that are struggling. Oh, I thank you, Lord. That's who you are. We give you praise. We give you honor. As this service continues today, Lord, may we all be in our proper positions in the spirit. May we not get out of line, get out of position, but may we stay in our position that you can accomplish the fullest in this house today. out across the stream. You see all of the needs, but God, I pray that they would be in their positions today for the glory of the Lord. We surrender our will fully to you that you can do what you want to do and as long as you want to do it. &gt;&gt; We surrender. &gt;&gt; Once again, I yield my will to you, Lord. have your way &gt;&gt; in the name that is above every name, &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. For you are great. You do miracles so great. There is no one else like you. [Music] There is no one else like you. For you are great. You do miracles so great. [Music] like you. [Music] There is no one else like you. Now put your hands together and give him a gl great clap of praise. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For you are great. You do miracles, [Music] Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; There's no one else like you. There is no one else like you. For you are great. You do miracles. [Music] There is no one else like you. There is no like you. To you Lord be all glory and praise. Glory and praise. 10,000 hallelujah that would bring honor to your name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may have your seats today. &gt;&gt; This life is because of you, Lord. My breath is because of you. I worship you Jesus. I worship you Lord. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We worship you Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. We're so grateful for those messengers from heaven. They're not random. They move in divine order. They don't get the wrong place at the wrong time. Every one of them are at the right place at the right time. And we welcome them. We welcome them. Hallelujah. As we welcome them, we welcome you in the house of the Lord. Today, &gt;&gt; we're here to lift up the name of Jesus, [Music] &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ, Yeshua, the Messiah. God is a spirit. He couldn't be seen and he knew he couldn't redeem us as a human race fallen. So he created a body and stepped into it. Came down to redeem. Oh, what a plan he has. Embrace it, my friend. Embrace the plan of God in your life. God makes no mistakes. He is perfect in all of his ways. Oh, what plans he has. And that plan that he had was to bring a body that he would call by his own name back to himself. &gt;&gt; Perfect, complete. Hallelujah. We continue to worship today as we give of our tithe and offering. Brother Cade is going to slip over to the piano and we're going to continue to worship with him. Don't want to dwell on it, but I just want you to know that I got confirmation earlier today that work will proceed on Wednesday. I don't know what time. I don't know all the logistics, but I will try to give the logistics to you as I know them. Just pay attention. Austin, will you and Jonathan come and receive the tithe and offering as we're worshiping? Pay attention to the roads. Pay attention to the app. Pay attention to text. We'll do what we can for especially those of you that live here on the ground. Father, I thank you for givers. I thank you that they keep covenant with you. And as we give our tithe and offering today, we continue to worship by doing just that, giving of our tithe and offering to you. For you are good and merciful, and you supply every need, both for our families and for this ministry, that your work can be accomplished in the end time. We give you praise in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Thank you, Lord. [Music] As I kneel in the darkness in the middle of the night, I'm praying for assurance. Everything's going to be all right. And Lord, I see another battle. It's down in front of me. And I'm afraid I won't be able and I'll go down in defeat. And he said, "Do you remember where I brought you from? Just take a look behind you and how far you've come. Oh, and every time you ask me, did it not deliver you? So why would you be thinking that I wouldn't see you through? Didn't I walk on the water and I called the raging sea? I spoke to the wind and it husted and I gave you peace. Didn't I run to your rescue? Didn't I hear you when you called? I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall. Now she's talking to her father in a house that was once a home. She said, "My bills are coming due, Lord, and six days is not that long." She hears a voice so soft and low. says, "I've moved like that before and I'll do this little thing, child, and I'll give you so much more." Then I walk on the water, and I calm the raging sea. I spoke to the wind and it hushed and I gave you peace. Then I run to your rescue. Didn't I hear you when you call? I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall. Then I leave all of heaven just to die for your sin. I searched until I found you. And I do it all again. As I kneel in the darkness, in the middle of the night, I keep praying for assurance that everything's going to be all right. Lord, I see another battle. It's down right in front of me. And I'm afraid I won't be able. and I'll go down in the feed. And he says, "Do you remember just where I brought you from? Take a look behind you and see how far you've come. Oh, and every time you ask me, did not deliver you." So why would you be thinking that I wouldn't see you through? Didn't I walk on the water and I calmed the raging sea? I spoke to the wind and it hushed and I gave you peace. Didn't I run to your rescue? Didn't I hear you when you call? Well, I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall. Didn't I leave all of heaven? Just die for your sin. Well, I searched right until I found you. And I knew it all again. And in I walk on the water and I called your agency.

We pray Lord. &gt;&gt; Some of us have tried to live from our own substance, from our own life, but there is no life for a believer outside of the true vine. May we abide in you. &gt;&gt; May we draw our strength from you. &gt;&gt; Oh, make us mold us your sanctuary. [Music] Make us your house. If you would have desired to live forever in a house of cedar, you would have. If you would have desired to live forever in a tent, you would have. [Music] But you desired a body. You desired a company, a people totally surrendered to the perfect mind of God. Totally surrendered. &gt;&gt; Oh, of people moving in synchronization with the mind of God. not doing their own thing but doing discerning your thing Lord your will your purpose your plan [Music] I hear the Lord saying I will not be your lucky charm I will not be your good luck charm arm. I have to be all in all. &gt;&gt; I hear the Lord saying, "Make me your all in all and be careful how you respond. Don't deceive your own selves. He knows &gt;&gt; what we hold on to. [Music] &gt;&gt; Make me your all in all. Make me your everything. &gt;&gt; Yield your will. Yield your will. &gt;&gt; Make me your everything. Draw your strength from me, says the Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to be your everything. [Music] Never fail you, never forsake you. Let me be your all and all. [Music] You've got to make time. You've got to make room for me in your life. You've crowded me out. You've pushed me away. You've spoken contrary to my word concerning yourself, concerning others. So I call you into my side. Draw strength. Draw life. Your religious busyiness produces no fruit. &gt;&gt; It's your yieldedness I'm after. &gt;&gt; Yield to me. [Music] Change your mind. Take mine. I will be your all and all. Even everything you need. More than your mind could imagine. union. Lord, this is our desire &gt;&gt; to yield to oneness. &gt;&gt; Would you please show somebody this morning that it is not religion, it's relationship. &gt;&gt; You're not looking for performance. You're looking for yieldedness that comes from nothingness. Lord, show some of us today that Enoch was not because he was not. Show some of us today that he had to empty himself of his own will, forfeit his own agenda so that he could be was not translated into another dimension. He had to empty himself of his own thoughts and opinions and inner struggles and and then he just went walking with you. [Music] Lord, you're going to have a people who walk with you in the cool of the evening and they find the strength from you that they need to get through whatever it is that life is dishing out. Would you just lift your hands to him? Just lift your hands to him and just love him. I know this is very foreign, this kind of atmosphere for some folks, but this is this is the atmosphere I thrive. This is the atmosphere I was created to live in. So, uh, please, I don't want to disturb it for another moment or two because it's just peace and life and strength to me. It's like an IV. It's like an umbilical cord when the when the when the very mind of God is in the building. Thank you, Father. Thank you, Father, that you love this little group of people here so much that you would come to us today. And even with all the moving and the distraction and all of the emotion that goes on to try to get us to this place, the enemy will magnify and amplify human emotions to keep us from this place. But we're here, Lord. We're here because of your willingness to draw us up. &gt;&gt; Come, my beloved, &gt;&gt; walk with me. Walk with me. Come my beloved, walk with me [Music] through the rain, through the storm, through the terror by night. &gt;&gt; Walk with me. Oh, for you are mine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I am yours, [Music] says the Lord. Walk with me. Talk with me. Hear my voice. Even when you're alone. And I will empower you. I will strengthen you. I'll be your hiding place. &gt;&gt; Hide in me. Rest in me. Come my beloved. Get up. Get up above this life. Get up above this life. Get up above this life. Walk with me through heavenly places. Walk with me through realms of life and hope and faith and love. Get up above your own thoughts until you find the thoughts of the Lord. [Music] Come my beloved and walk. Walk with me. [Music] [Music] Oh, what an invitation. Lord, I'll take you. I'll take you. I'll take you at your word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll walk with you through heavenly places. I'll walk with you through peace and through love. Whatever Lord you've got, I'll walk with you. Oh, if you'll just not leave us alone in this hour, we'll walk with you, Jesus. We'll surrender. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Walk with me. my beloved. Now, we're going to the word, but just before we do, sing this back to him. I'll walk with you. &gt;&gt; My beloved, &gt;&gt; I will talk with you. &gt;&gt; My beloved, my heart is yours. Your love is mine, [Music] &gt;&gt; my beloved. &gt;&gt; You're just responding to his voice by saying, "Yes, Lord, I will. I will walk with you. I will talk with you, my beloved. [Music] &gt;&gt; Your word will be my banquet. shall be my food &gt;&gt; where my strength comes from. &gt;&gt; I will walk with you. Tell him one more time. I will walk with you, my beloved. I will talk with you, my beloved. [Music] My heart is yours. Your love is mine, my beloved. What a joy to know that I am my beloveds &gt;&gt; and my beloved is mine. &gt;&gt; How many of you are glad that he is yours and you are his &gt;&gt; and you know it beyond the shadow of any doubt? &gt;&gt; Let me see your hand. Do you know it? &gt;&gt; Are you surrendering to that every day or just when you come to church or just when you feel like it or are you surrendering to that call every day of your life? You must you will not survive this last hour spiritually. You will not thrive or survive in this last hour if you treat him like a like a one time like a one time a week thing. Oh no. It takes daily fellowship. It takes day. You people that are saying amen. Is that because you do it or because you know it's true? It's true, isn't it? &gt;&gt; It's true. But we're there there is no other hiding place but in him. &gt;&gt; He knows us, doesn't he? I don't want to disturb the atmosphere that we're in, but I know the Lord's heart is pleased with the gifts that he's placed in these precious people's lives. So, let's give God honor. [Music] Uh, I need your help at the end of the service to make another announcement and I could make it now, but I don't want to be responsible for shifting this that I feel right now. And so I'll I'll if you'll remind me, I'll make an announcement concerning just just let me say this as we're going. We're we're uh we're getting toward our capacity for the banquet. So you need to be aware of that. And at the end of the service, uh I'll mention to you what we need you to do if you plan to join us or if you have someone staying with you and you feel like they're going going to want to be here and so forth. Sometimes people will reach out and we won't even know they're coming, but some of you will know. And this time it's going to be imperative for us to know because we're we're getting we're getting up there. Praise God. That means we're going to have a wonderful group of people for camp meeting. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah chapter 1 and we're going to verse 16. I realize that we've spent some extra time. I tell you right now that won't hurt you. and it won't hurt me &gt;&gt; to spend a little extra time in his presence. &gt;&gt; And if I were you, if you can get in that channel, I wouldn't be moving around in that moment. I I I I would hold myself uh in that kind of an atmosphere. I wouldn't want to budge if I didn't have to budge. A &gt;&gt; and I know that people sometimes are not sensitive to that because you can see the way they just carry on. they just continue doing what they're doing. It reminds me of the Pentecostals when uh messages and tongues and interpretation and things would happen uh there toward the end. They were so used to it. It was so common until people would get up and go to the bathroom. It's supposed to be I I don't know that it always was, but it's supposed to be the voice of God in the house. I can't imagine, you know, somebody uh not honoring and respecting that moment if we really believed that God was moving. So, um we want to be sensitive to the spirit of the Lord. There's a time to be funny and there's a time to be sober. &gt;&gt; Amen. And sensitive. Isaiah chapter 1. I'm going somewhere today that I don't uh delight in going, but I know that I I have to and putting it off. It's not going to help me and it's not going to help you. So, I want to share with you uh some some scriptures and some thoughts concerning something that happened to me. Uh I shared it. It happened on Saturday night, August the 23rd, but I shared a piece of it with you on Sunday morning, August the 24th. And I want to share uh some scriptures to go along with it because God has been so gracious to give me some more understanding of what it is that he is uh talking to us about in this hour. I just want to hear him. You know, there's no no shortage of things to preach. It's a big book. &gt;&gt; It's full. And the message of the hour is full. &gt;&gt; Nearly 1,200 sermons we can pull from. And I love to do it. But oh my, if we if we if we do that and we miss &gt;&gt; what the Lord would I want to know what he would say to me now. &gt;&gt; Uh if there were there not there's not a prophet messenger. It's finished. There won't be an eighth one. But but if if there were to be one, I would I would want to know what what he had to say. I I mean, what I'm saying by that, I hope you won't misunderstand. I mean, I would want to What would What would Brother Brand Let's say it this way. What would Brother Brandham talk about if he were here today? &gt;&gt; I want to know. I want to know that &gt;&gt; he's not. And God didn't make a mistake. But I don't want to just be in the middle of a series and just hang there because there's nowhere else to be. &gt;&gt; I want to be led by the spirit. &gt;&gt; I need your prayers &gt;&gt; always. &gt;&gt; I I don't have to tell you how to pray. &gt;&gt; I don't even know how. Brother David reached out. He said, "Tell me how to pray. I I don't know how to tell you to pray for my family. Just pray." &gt;&gt; Let's pray that we can always please him. Isaiah 1 verse 16 through 20. wash you, make you clean. Put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes. Cease to do evil. Learn to do well. Seek judgment, which is justice here. Relieve the oppressed. Do you hear it? &gt;&gt; You don't have to go looking far to find oppressed. They may be sitting beside you on the pew this morning. Relieve the oppressed. Judge the fatherless. Plead for the widow. And again, this word judgment is a word that means render justice to. Come now and let us reason together. This is not the human reasoning that caused Eve to go astray. This is spiritual uh meditation. It's spiritual ponderings. It means let us see the whole picture. Come now and let us reason together, sayaeth the Lord. Though your sins be as scarlet, &gt;&gt; they shall be as &gt;&gt; white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be &gt;&gt; as &gt;&gt; white like wool. Isn't that wonderful? And here is it's the key. It's not just the key to Isaiah's prophecy. It's the key to 2025. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If ye be willing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If ye be willing, &gt;&gt; some are willing &gt;&gt; as long as it's comfortable, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But when you say yes, you're not just yesing. comfortable assignment. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You're yesing the mind of God. Whatever he wants to do in you and for you and through you. If you be willing &gt;&gt; and [Music] &gt;&gt; obedient, you shall eat the good of the land. Amen. &gt;&gt; That not that's not United States of America land. That's spiritual promised land. &gt;&gt; Your spiritual inheritance, &gt;&gt; you'll eat it. &gt;&gt; If you be &gt;&gt; willing &gt;&gt; and obedient. I know we know this, but if you be willing and obedient, &gt;&gt; both &gt;&gt; conjunction and willing and willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the promise. &gt;&gt; The good of the land. &gt;&gt; You will eat it because you have occupied it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You will occupy your promise. You will live in and on your promise. If you be willing and obedient. &gt;&gt; If you be willing and obedient, you shall eat the benefit of the promise. &gt;&gt; You shall be the beneficiary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Of the promise. &gt;&gt; Woo. Isn't that good news? &gt;&gt; You may be seated. God add his blessing to the reading of his word. The next verse. But if somebody say if. &gt;&gt; I know. I know you you you you may be too tired for class participation, but I need I need class participation. If &gt;&gt; big word, &gt;&gt; just two little letters, &gt;&gt; but it's a huge word. If &gt;&gt; if if &gt;&gt; if you refuse, &gt;&gt; if you be willing and obedient, ye shall possess, &gt;&gt; right? Not only will you possess, you will have strength, power, and authority to dispossess what is squatting &gt;&gt; on your inheritance. &gt;&gt; The devil refuses to budge many times until you address him with the authority that's given to you as a part. You're a part of God. You're a part of the very creator, the very one who created him. &gt;&gt; And when you use bridal authority, the authority of an adopted son, a fully adopted son, a whos, not a tetanon, not a toddler. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But a man, &gt;&gt; when I became a man, I put away. I want to tell you as your pastor this morning, it's well past the time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For us to put away childish things. &gt;&gt; I know some of you are are are immature by nature and you were raised by immature people. And so there are many ways that we mimic and copy the behavior, the decision making process of how we were brought up, the environment that we brought up in. And we saw mama go all to pieces &gt;&gt; over everything that happened, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And we saw daddy go silent. &gt;&gt; He just clammed up like a big old clam. He didn't help mama. &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Get up, woman. &gt;&gt; We're going to make this together. &gt;&gt; Come on now." &gt;&gt; He clammed up. He went outside. &gt;&gt; Left mama in the floor. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. Because his heart, his pain, his he he was dealing with it his way. you you can get by with that in church annity, &gt;&gt; but we're we must be beyond church annity. &gt;&gt; We're in adoption. &gt;&gt; And the adopted sons of God are manifesting who he is &gt;&gt; and not the environment that we brought were brought up in. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's time for us to grow up. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sounds like you're I can't help it. &gt;&gt; I can't help the hat I'm wearing today. I didn't choose this hat. I didn't know this. I'm just going to be obedient. &gt;&gt; I didn't come to play. I don't think you came to play. &gt;&gt; At least you came. Some didn't come at all. I'm glad you came. But I'm telling you what, the the it's time to put away childish things. so many times through the 35 years that we have been together as a body of believers. 35 years. &gt;&gt; So many times in 35 years, the spirit of God has moved us up into a place &gt;&gt; where we ought to have been able to activate everything that we believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. We should have been able to understand by revelation what we believe &gt;&gt; you know some people don't even know what they believe and around this message they make such stupid statements &gt;&gt; and they say well you don't even have you know you don't really have to know just just believe you really don't have to know what you believe you don't really have to know I don't believe that God opened up &gt;&gt; the mysteries of the ages is &gt;&gt; to leave us more confused than we were before we knew there were mysteries. &gt;&gt; I wasn't as confused in Pentecost as some people are now &gt;&gt; in this message. &gt;&gt; That is not what the truth come to do. And that is not God's fault and it's not brother Brandham's fault. &gt;&gt; The responsibility falls on ourselves. You know, somebody will always uh inadvertently come along and they want to instruct us or school us in the message and and that's all right. I've got lots to learn, but I'm not going to learn it from somebody who just repeats what their pastor says. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to learn much from somebody who's just a parent. &gt;&gt; I'm going to learn from somebody who's had a touch of heaven in their life. It's fallen on the word that God has given us a generation ago and it has now become a personal revelation in their life. And they can not only talk about it, they can demonstrate it. &gt;&gt; When there has to be the full manifestation of such as that if we're ever going to take a rapture, &gt;&gt; I don't know what people are expecting the rapture to be, but it's not going to be anything until When I was a child, I I I acted as a child. I spoke as a child. I got my feelings hurt all the time. &gt;&gt; Just like a little child, you add a new baby to the family and sometimes the the the present child feels displaced and misplaced and put out. And um I told you how foolish. I'm not a I'm not a jealous person by nature. My wife can tell you that I'm not a jealous person by nature, but when our first baby come along, I I wasn't jealous of my wife's attention toward the baby because I knew that he needed her, &gt;&gt; but I just felt bad because everybody else was holding the baby and I wasn't getting all the turns I wanted. &gt;&gt; That was sweet, but it was childish. I didn't do it out of some bad intent, but I just thought, well, my goodness, everybody comes in, they just grab the baby and and and I want to hold him. And then about three years into it, I was looking for somebody that would hold him. You know how that works. &gt;&gt; So, so we grow up &gt;&gt; and we look at things differently. And I've told you before, when the pacifier fell, we scalded it. When we heard that pregnant women shouldn't eat chocolate, I hid all the threw I threw some out. Little did I know, my wife had a stash. No wonder the B no wonder Benjamin turned out odd. &gt;&gt; She was sneaking chocolate. We wanted to do everything right, &gt;&gt; but we were a little bit immature. I wouldn't say particularly naive, but we were certainly immature. &gt;&gt; And you can't do it all right. You you everything. By the time we had boiled that paci and had to replace it so many times cuz we had boiled the rubber loose. Then we started picking it up, licking it off &gt;&gt; and popping it in his mouth. Before it was over, I just picked it up and put in his mouth. &gt;&gt; You grow, you realize you can't panic &gt;&gt; because you're growing up. The spirit of the Lord is calling a people in this hour to grow up now some &gt;&gt; instead of thriving on on confusion and thriving on on drama. &gt;&gt; Some people are miserable unless there's a stink that's stirring. &gt;&gt; Woo. Let me loosen my tie and let me amen the preacher. Amen. &gt;&gt; They have so adapted &gt;&gt; to this confusing atmosphere &gt;&gt; that if it's not there, they miss it. &gt;&gt; They can't function unless there's some kind of stink &gt;&gt; that's stirring. &gt;&gt; I love peace in my family. I don't know why people like &gt;&gt; chaos, &gt;&gt; Babylon, &gt;&gt; confusion. &gt;&gt; You're you're tiptoeing around Sally and Oh, sorry, Sally. tiptoeing around Genevieve. When my mother was looking for a name, she'd say Meratroid. I hope that's not ugly. You You're tiptoeing around Mergroid. Javante names you don't know where what planet sometime they come from. Some mamas my they call it creative. I I think it's challenged a little myself. But anyway, you you're tiptoeing around ant and tiptoeing around. You're walking on eggshells. It's all right if it's out there. If it's your your unsaved, lost, unregenerated family and you're trying to be a light to them. But believers, believers, Holy Ghost fil word believers and they thrive. They only come alive sometime when there's some kind of confusion and if it starts dying down, they grab a big old spoon and they stir it more and more to keep something going all the time. If you be willing and obedient, you'll eat the good of the land. &gt;&gt; If you grow up, &gt;&gt; you'll eat the good of the land. &gt;&gt; But if you refuse &gt;&gt; and rebel me, if I refuse and rebel, I will be devoured. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; With a sword. &gt;&gt; For the mouth, &gt;&gt; huh? &gt;&gt; For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. If you be willing, &gt;&gt; there's too much performance. Yes, &gt;&gt; I s I see it often here even people spending the whole worship hour looking around &gt;&gt; to see what everybody else is doing. You're going to miss your chance. &gt;&gt; The only time they put on a little worship is when they realize somebody's watching them. Sure they are. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; sure, somebody's going to be watching you. But I tell you, the kind of praise you put on because you think somebody's watching you is not the praise that's going to pull you up into a higher atmosphere to have your needs met and and have your faith anchored in the word. &gt;&gt; I tell you, there's so much pretense in this late hour, 35 years later. There's so much pretense still in people's lives. Uh a performance mentality a and it's got to go. It's got to go. It's got to go. It's got to go. It has to leave us because it's time to be willing and obedient. &gt;&gt; Willing and obedient. You're never going to like everything that everybody else does. Get your eyes on Jesus and be willing. &gt;&gt; Who you talking to? You. &gt;&gt; If you be willing &gt;&gt; and obedient, &gt;&gt; you'll eat the good of the promise. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll be the promise. &gt;&gt; You'll be the manifestation of the promise. &gt;&gt; But if you refuse, &gt;&gt; if you refuse &gt;&gt; and rebel, Oh, &gt;&gt; you shall be devoured with the sword, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. &gt;&gt; I I want to speak to you for a little while this morning on destiny forfeited or fulfilled. &gt;&gt; And if I had a subtitle, I would call it refusing the scroll. I've taught many times on on destiny purpose and even scrolls of destiny. The ministry of Jesus was such that he said about his own ministry, I can do nothing &gt;&gt; except it's revealed to me &gt;&gt; of my father. &gt;&gt; That doesn't make a trinity. &gt;&gt; It puts a body on an eternal spirit. &gt;&gt; Now he's got a body. &gt;&gt; Not just a theophony, but now he has a body. He's not just a rainbow. He's not just a pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; He's not just a uh you know what a cloud. Thank you. &gt;&gt; He He has a body. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "I can't do anything of my own. I must do what I see him, what I hear from him, what is revealed to me from him. That's what I must do. And uh you might understand that because he's he's telling us in a in a slight paraphrase here. He's telling us it's by vision. &gt;&gt; You might not be familiar with that pertaining to the ministry of Jesus, but every one of you are familiar with that concept pertaining to the ministry of brother Brandham. He he operated by vision. &gt;&gt; And as long as he was willing and obedient, &gt;&gt; the the vision was fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I told you a few weeks ago the brown bear was another story. &gt;&gt; He said God was there. He was ready to do what he intended to do and &gt;&gt; we get in the way. &gt;&gt; It's unsanctified mercy. &gt;&gt; Mercy is a wonderful thing. Sanctified. It's the right thing. It's the right thing to do. Show mercy. But I want you to know you can show mercy that is not godly mercy. right now. &gt;&gt; Just like some people, anybody who asks, you say, "Well, isn't that what the Bible said?" Listen, we're living in an hour right now where you ought to be wise about your alms. &gt;&gt; They'll come up to you at the gas station. They'll come up to you at the grocery store parking lot. You've got to be led by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And if you're of a of this mindset, uh, because you take this verse and you say, "Well, uh, if they ask, give." And so if if that's your motto, do it. But the scripture also says we should be careful about putting a bottle to our neighbor's mouth &gt;&gt; when they when they ought to be eating a cheeseburger by now. &gt;&gt; And so sometimes we're enabling people to continue in the bondage &gt;&gt; to the demon that has them bound. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God would have to tell me, &gt;&gt; evidently, he told Brother Vanom, he'd have to tell me to buy somebody a pack of cigarettes, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I don't want to buy somebody's speed. I don't want to buy somebody uh all of these different kinds of drugs. And I don't want to do it. But when the spirit of the Lord, oh, we've got to be so in tune with him. &gt;&gt; I want to help that one. I want to help him deep. I want to help them bigmen. But I don't want to just be handing it out because I think there someone has asked and I'm maybe you should say then let me take you here and buy you a sack of hamburgers. Let me let me take you over here and get you a Dr. Pepper. Uh that'll help anything that ails you. Or you might what whatever it is that you but but be wise as serpents and harmless as doves because maybe we're not all moving by vision. But brother Brandham operated. He was operating by that. And Jesus, his own ministry was moved by what the father showed him, what he saw, what he knew the father wanted to be done. Well, if we're becoming one with him, &gt;&gt; come on now. &gt;&gt; It may not be a picture that flashes. It may just be a knowing that breaks forth in your heart &gt;&gt; and you say, "Yeah, this is the one I want to invest in. This is the one. But I and I'll buy this one food, but I'm not giving the money to go and pay the dealer. &gt;&gt; It's not my responsibility to pay the drug debt. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. &gt;&gt; We got to be led in this hour. Lots of wisdom, &gt;&gt; uh, lots of maturity. &gt;&gt; That means some of us are going to have to have great change. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Cuz we get so upset. We remember mama in the floor and that's where we go. &gt;&gt; Paralyzed in the bed &gt;&gt; because there's problems. They're going to if you if you stay in bed every day that there's problems. &gt;&gt; You're going to be stinking. You're going to be smelling because you're going to be in the bed a long time. &gt;&gt; You and I have to come to a place where we say, "Lord, this load is so heavy. I I could never carry it by myself. Thanks be to God. Thanks be to God. I don't have to carry it &gt;&gt; by myself. Greater is he that is in me than he &gt;&gt; Have you ever been depressed? I know what depression is. I know what clinical diagnosed depression and anxiety is. and and and so many years ago before they gave a pill to everybody who complained about stress. &gt;&gt; I I dealt with it when it was still a big stigma to have anxiety or to have panic attacks. I know what it's like to be low, to be down in the dumps or or the mlly grubs or the blues or whatever you want to call it for no reason even. right &gt;&gt; for no reason even &gt;&gt; life good wife good children good good but it just &gt;&gt; and you can choose to stay under the heaviness of that &gt;&gt; or you can go the Bible route &gt;&gt; may take you weeks to get there but there's a Bible route hallelujah shake off those heavy bands hands. &gt;&gt; Sing a new song unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Go all over your house talking in tongues. &gt;&gt; There's nobody there to judge you. &gt;&gt; And when I decide to do that, I don't shut the windows. I'm I I'm like Daniel. I'm not ashamed &gt;&gt; of having to push my way in to the presence of God. I'll tell you what's wrong with people so often in this hour is they'll look you in the face and say, "I hate it when people pity me." &gt;&gt; And I want to say to them sometime, "Oh, really? &gt;&gt; Oh, really?" &gt;&gt; Because from where I'm standing, you seem to love pity. You remind me of the Pharisees that if they're going to fast, they are they want the whole world to know they're fasting. &gt;&gt; If they got a problem, they want the whole world to know they're in the despairs. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. You'll learn eventually, but it better be quick because you're being called on to be willing &gt;&gt; and obedient. If if there's any tone, if you sense a tone in me this morning that would make you think that I am uh not uh legitimizing, I am legitimizing all of your anxiety and your stress and your heartache and your burden and your emotion and your depression and your heaviness. It's so it's real. It's not a fantasy. But what I can't do &gt;&gt; is celebrate it. &gt;&gt; You don't need somebody else to celebrate it. &gt;&gt; You need somebody else to show you how to get out of it. &gt;&gt; This is the road map out. &gt;&gt; You'll stay there as long as you're trying to figure out how to change people around you. You'll stay depressed. &gt;&gt; You'll stay in that. But once you make up your mind, I don't care. I can't help. I can't help that. I can't help that. I can't do that. I don't know how to fix that. But I've got to get myself up out of the valley of despair. I've got to pull myself up. There's a king in my castle &gt;&gt; who says it's time to rule and reign with authority in your life. &gt;&gt; Woo. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to forfeit anything that belongs to me. &gt;&gt; Today is the seventh of September 2025. Tomorrow will be 35 years ago. My life changed forever. My precious grandmother, who I loved dearly, who had been there for me always, took her last breath 35 years ago tomorrow, and it changed everything. There was no big mama to pull me up, to pack me out, to help me out. I've told you enough about her to tell you that just a year before she passed, m maybe not even a year, the motor on the o on the vehicle I drove blew up, left me stranded on the side of the road coming here. There was no money. There was no money. There was gas money. What good did the did a tank of gas do when I had to leave it behind me on the side of the road? &gt;&gt; I didn't know what I would do. I didn't know how I'd get back to South Carolina. We hadn't uh hadn't closed the church there. And uh I didn't know what I would do. And a and a dear sister who was helping take care of my grandmother, she came to me one day. She said, "Steve," and she could do that because we were that close. She said, "Steve," she knew me all my life. She said, "I want to I want to loan you the money." She said, "No terms, no interest. I want to loan you the money and my husband knows a mechanic and we're going to get the motor rebuilt or or whatever we have to do. It doesn't matter what it cost. We're not going to leave you stranded here." But she said, "It's just a it's just a loan." And I knew I knew I'd been in her home. I knew that they didn't have new furniture. They had dirty wood floors. When I say that, I mean they weren't refinished. They were the original deal. They weren't pretty. The chair was threadbear and the couch had so many quilts thrown over it to cover the springs. And they were just happy. They they her own automobile was 20 years old. They hadn't I didn't know how in the world they'd come up with that amount of money, but she'd give me that money and I was able to with her husband's help to get the motor taken care of so I could get back to South Carolina. And 35 years ago tomorrow when my grandmother drew her last breath, that little sister was there and she walked over to me. She I was kneeling down beside my granny and she come behind me and grabbed me like from behind, wrapped her arms around me and whispered in my ear and she said, "Honey, you don't owe us that money. It wasn't our money. We didn't loan you that money." I said, "What do you mean?" She said, "Your grandmother gave you that money, but she didn't want you to know that it was from her." Because she wanted you to always remember, even when she wasn't here, that he would be your source. In the moment that you start looking to people &gt;&gt; as your source &gt;&gt; expecting them to always rescue you. You have left the privilege of having confidence and faith in a mighty God &gt;&gt; who can meet your need if he has to do it under a piece of trash on the side of the road. The wind blow and expose the money laying there &gt;&gt; that you have need of. She had taught me that my life. Don't look to people. Don't look to offerings. Don't look to churches. &gt;&gt; You look to God. &gt;&gt; He will meet your need. &gt;&gt; He will take care of you. &gt;&gt; How many of you have proven him? &gt;&gt; And you know, &gt;&gt; granny used to say, "Pay it'll come." It doesn't always come on Friday or the third of the month. &gt;&gt; But God's got a payday. &gt;&gt; He's got a record kept. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Don't look to one another for your needs to be met. &gt;&gt; Look to the master. &gt;&gt; He may use. It's our privilege. It's part of Isaiah 1. Lord, may we be responsible enough &gt;&gt; to render justice &gt;&gt; to the widow &gt;&gt; and to the fatherless &gt;&gt; to those who have real need. &gt;&gt; May we be sensitive, but as people of God, may we not look to each other &gt;&gt; with some sense of expectation. And that because I'm telling you, sometimes people are slow and they may not get what you're trying to do. A and they may not meet your need and you may be disappointed and you may lose confidence in them and you may stumble even in your faith toward God. But if you'll go straight to the source every time, &gt;&gt; hello. &gt;&gt; He will take care of us. forfeite, destiny forfeited or fulfilled. We've talked about the books of heaven. The Bible's clear. There's not just one book. There are multiple books. Uh that in fact we understand by following all the quotes. We've had ministers to come and preach here. totally sincere, wonderful, precious brothers who would preach to us from one set of quotes telling us that the book of life and the lamb's book of life are the same book. It's just all all they read. It's it's perhaps what they heard. But you'll never I don't care what they say. You'll never be able to get the full picture by looking at one or two just isolated little quotes over here. &gt;&gt; And if you think that 63 rule will will be a solve all, it won't. &gt;&gt; Some people say if you really want to know what the message is and you look after 63. Oh, &gt;&gt; that won't work every time. That may work sometime. That won't work every time. &gt;&gt; No. because even between 63 and 65, whether it was by a slip of the tongue, I don't know. But he reverted a time or two back to something that he had said previously. Why do you think that is, but I I don't know for sure. I'm not I'm not uh you know in on all the detail, but what I what I think I'll tell you as a thought, not a doctrine. I think that God allows things sometime to happen so that you and I will take what we hear, what we what we feed on, what we respect, but we will always take it back to the word and and see what dove tales and we don't have to condemn the rest by any means, but we don't build our life on something that doesn't line up right to the letter of the word. May the spirit of Bereans fall upon all of us. And may we look at all the things he said. If we're studying a subject according to the message, may we look at all the things he said. And &gt;&gt; and uh so we know there was a there's a lamb's book of life. And there's a book of life. And in the lamb's book of life, your name cannot be erased out of the lamb's book of life. He said your name was there from before the foundation of the world &gt;&gt; and it cannot be blotted out. &gt;&gt; But there's a book of life and there there is the possibility of names being blotted out of the book of life. Those who ultimately reject God's plan for help and hope and salvation. And it is as though in the in the oracles and records of eternity, it is as though that person never existed. I don't know if that strikes you heavy or not. &gt;&gt; That strikes me pretty heavy. If your name is blotted out of the book of life, you didn't exist. &gt;&gt; It is as though you never showed up in on the planet. And it does happen. The scriptures are clear. But there are other books the Bible talks about. There's a book that is kept it. It records those who meet together. in the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Those who meet often and speak of these things, there's a record. There's a book kept. Now, since there were no books in the times of the Bible, we say scrolls because that's how everything was was kept. And that's when we when we hear of the open book, we're blessed because that's what our Bible says. But books were not invented when John was on the aisle of Patmas. &gt;&gt; Interesting, isn't it? There weren't even books. &gt;&gt; It was a scroll and it was sealed with seals. And I like the picture of that because when God deals with me about destinies, he often deals with me and that kind of picture scrolls. And on August 23rd, I had this experience and I'm going to read you what I shared with you spontaneously that morning if you don't mind. Uh I don't mean to quote myself as though that was some brother Green used to say when they when they start quoting you, you've arrived. And I said, "What if you quote yourself?" He said, "Well, I'm not going there." So, and then in the next breath he'd say, you know, I'm an I'm an icon. He said, "They say I'm an icon in the message." And he would kind of laugh about it. But I could tell that after all he'd been through, he was just glad that somebody said something nice. &gt;&gt; And when when they say icon in that term, they mean a they mean a fixture. They mean they mean something that is predominant, something that is there or there and as much a part of it as anything, not some icon to worship. But anyway, I'm I'm reading you sang about it today. Now on the pathway, the wine press falls heavy, but it's bringing forth only the best of the wine. Would you choose any other way? Wouldn't you want to be the best of the best? And the only way to do that might be I tell you it is through submission. &gt;&gt; Remember the rest of this verse. I believe the verse continues with so into submission to him. &gt;&gt; I surrender this day. And that's a significant thing. It's a big step to agree to. There are certain things that you agreed to before you arrived here and there are some things you'll agree to now if you want to move forward in him. &gt;&gt; Remember the the the the invitation is if if you be willing and obedient. &gt;&gt; So there are things that you'll agree to now if you want to move forward in him. Are you here? Amen. &gt;&gt; And I saw mantels because sometimes in in dreams or visions or experiences you see clothes, cloaks, uh pieces of material like the girdle that is wrapped around as we mentioned last week to tuck the ends of the robe into for running, girding up your loins. Sometimes you'll see things like that in dreams or visions and it represents callings or anointings. And we know that from scripture and I already mentioned that because Elisha refused to let Elijah get out of his sight. &gt;&gt; And when he goes up, the mantle comes down. He grabs that mantle and goes out over the water, wraps it around his arm, does exactly like he saw his master do. Are you sure you're here? &gt;&gt; Well, you just said that. Yeah. Want you to hear it again. And he smoked the water. Pow. &gt;&gt; Where is the Lord God of? Oh, they love that. They love that around the message. They love saying that. It's all right. Scripture. I like it, too. But that's not the point for you and I. We shouldn't have to be saying, "Where is the Lord God of Elijah? &gt;&gt; Where is the Lord God of William Brandom?" &gt;&gt; We ought to have come to a place of maturity and adoption. And if God's calling us, we ought to be able to wrap that mantel around our arm and call on the name of God for ourselves. &gt;&gt; Where is my God? God, I need you to come. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry if that offends you. That's just my thought here. You you don't you don't have to always put some something to it and attach something extra to it. You you you like he said, make sure all the dead cats are off the line and you can call on Jesus anytime. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But but of course this was powerful because this was the mantle. We're not looking for the mantle particularly of brother Brandham because he came with a commission that there were seven to come and seven hath come and and uh now it's a bride time &gt;&gt; and there's more than seven of us &gt;&gt; and we ought to be grabbing up whatever mantle God sends down whatever anointing he wants to put on you. &gt;&gt; Well, how do we know there are even different kinds of anointing? The prophet told us. He told us, he described what the anointing of Elijah was like. &gt;&gt; Well, that wasn't like the anointing of every other prophet. &gt;&gt; They all had different a and and servants of the Lord and the apostles and the disciples. They they had different callings and commissionings. They were sent to different kinds of people. They ministered in different kinds of ways because God isn't stuck in a box. He's a God of variety. &gt;&gt; Isn't he? &gt;&gt; Oh, are you? You are. &gt;&gt; And I saw mantels and anointings. I saw scrolls filled with revelation. And as soon as you say that, there's a lot of folks out there, oh yeah, that's too charismatic for me. &gt;&gt; No, no, it's too biblical. &gt;&gt; Because what? Instead of doing what he told us to do and checking out something first by the word, you do the search on the message computer system and you want to see if brother Brandham said anything about it to make sure that it's right. What about doing a Bible search? &gt;&gt; What about an oldfashioned Strongs concordance? &gt;&gt; This isn't reflecting negative on brother Brandham in any means at all. It just means that that's the this is the foundation. go right to the foundation. Uh I don't want to call names and get other people in trouble, but because maybe he has a different thought now than he had back then, but in in in in over 35 years ago when brother Henry Simmons and brother Isaiah Brooks, who were ministering in South Carolina, Brother Henry is still there. Brother Brooks is in Idaho and I just heard from him this week and he's inviting us to come out and speak for him again, but he came and not that I've been before, but that he's invited us before and uh would love to go very much. They came to where I was living in Anderson, South Carolina, and they they just can we help you? Can we answer questions? Can we give you material? We've heard that you have uh come across this great message and we want to be there and available and you know that's just that's just right. &gt;&gt; Seems like anymore if you hear that somebody else has come to a higher place of truth. Ah let's see if it last. &gt;&gt; Let's see if they've got enough strength to come out of that denomination. But I so appreciated the attitude of those two brothers. They came. They didn't know me. They came. They drove several hours to get to me and we spent the day together. I loved it. I appreciated it. They began to to invite me to preach for them there in South Carolina and I did for for several years. And then Brother Brooks went on to Ohio and I preached for him several times there in Ohio and appreciate their their life. Brother Henry Simmons said to me not too long after we met, he said, "Now, if you want to keep the anointing that you have on your ministry," he said, "Here's the way to do it. When God talks to your heart," he said, "you go back to the word. &gt;&gt; You find it in the book." &gt;&gt; That's right. He said, 'Now don't you go straight to the quotes &gt;&gt; because if you do, you'll lose the anointing that's on your life and you'll be an intellectual polyarrot. &gt;&gt; You'll just be repeating it like the like the like the disciples there in the scripture, you know, uh in the name of of the of the one that Paul preached about. &gt;&gt; Come out. And that didn't work too good. The demon screamed out, you know, Paul, I know Jesus. I Who in the world are you? &gt;&gt; You lose your own call and commission sometime if you don't do what you were always doing. He said, isn't that what you did before? You took you felt something, saw something, heard something, experienced something. Didn't you always go back to the word? Yes, sir. Absolutely. 100%. And he said, "If I were you, I'd keep doing that &gt;&gt; and then then I would search the message because if you found it in there, it's very likely &gt;&gt; now &gt;&gt; that you'll find it over here." &gt;&gt; Now, somebody here may resent that kind of advice, but it anchored me. I wish they were giving that kind of advice today &gt;&gt; because some people think that they can use the quotes just like just like some kind of magic potion or something and it's going to have the same authority and the same power. No, no, no, no. It's the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble. It's the life behind the name that makes the proud heart humble. &gt;&gt; It was God who devised the plan that in all things as a man he would live so he could give watch. Give us give us &gt;&gt; give us &gt;&gt; the life behind the name. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Quoting the newspaper doesn't make you a journalist. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you have a car in your garage doesn't make you a mechanic. &gt;&gt; Because you can find a quote doesn't make you called. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I loved that advice. Where was I? I saw uh scrolls filled with revelations, interpretations, understandings. I saw the callings of the Lord last night and a and I saw so much more. It was the burdens of the Lord. It was the zeal for the house of the Lord. I saw prophetic decrees and prophetic acts of demonstration that pass right by many people. I knew saints from New Hope, even family members who never even tried to catch or embrace these oilfilled assignments of the Lord. I saw some only half-heartedly making weak attempts to grab weak attempts to catch or embrace things of their own choosing. I literally saw people examining destiny assignments, the perfect plans of God, things that God has ordained his bride to do. And I saw people burning brain cells trying to decide if that is something that they would be willing to take and carry out. If you be willing &gt;&gt; and obedient, &gt;&gt; you shall eat the good of the land. &gt;&gt; I know you're tired. I saw some half-hearted attempts. At times, it seemed that a a few people were only reaching for things that might make them more noticed or bring more public attention and glory for themselves, while deeper, weightier assignments would pass by them without any effort at all to claim them. What I didn't tell you, but it's in my notes. What I didn't tell you was I actually saw people bargaining like a like a like a yard sale. Bargaining. Could I trade this in? I saw it in the bed in the night. I saw a person who was holding out waiting and someone asked him, "What are you waiting for?" It was a pullpit ministry that he was waiting for. And while he was waiting on a pull pit ministry weighty assignments of deliverance and hope and help and encouragement, who in the world would want to trade a fiery revival to go down to a black unic on the side of a road, foreign country, the treasurer of Candace, the Queen of Ethiopia. Who would want to give up a public revival that the that the people were ab a blaze and the news was spreading across the land in the book of Acts? Who would be willing to be caught away from a from a pedestal moment, a spotlight moment to go down and find one? Philip was willing. &gt;&gt; He had a little help getting there. &gt;&gt; But he was willing. &gt;&gt; There are no cessationists in this church that I know of. And if they are, I wonder how in the world you stumbled in here because we don't believe your dirty rotten doctrine that God only did these supernatural wonders in the times of the early church. In fact, we believe that everything God did in all the other church ages, he still has power and authority to do even in our day. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if someone traveled by means of the spirit then &gt;&gt; then we still believe that if God were a mind to &gt;&gt; he could catch somebody away today &gt;&gt; and he has &gt;&gt; and he will and he can. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like the prophet said about angels, we just we need people to believe in them. Y &gt;&gt; we know people talk about them and then they start coming and we become aware that they're there among us. &gt;&gt; We're not worshiping them th those angels or looking to them as our answer. But I tell you, I appreciate the fact &gt;&gt; that there's more for us &gt;&gt; that we can't see &gt;&gt; than the ones who are against us that we do see. Sometime my biggest uh support comes from another realm. Aren't you glad we've got that with us? Praise God. I saw some who let important destiny assignments trickle float like this by them while they were examining, waiting, and looking for an opportunity to have a pullpit call. May I just tell you that if that is your ambition and it's not God's design for your life, you're wasting your time holding out for that. &gt;&gt; You'd be more in the way than you would be anything else. It always seems to be so desirable to those who have never had that burden or responsibility. But you give it to them a while and maybe they would rather be the janitor of the church than then st come on now because just remember some of the same ones that are shouting on Sunday morning, hosana pastor. Praise the Lord. Hosanna pastor. Amen. Woo. Glory to God. God's man of power is in the house. &gt;&gt; By next weekend, they're crying, "Crucify him!" &gt;&gt; People are fickle. Don't get your eyes on a ministry because it's in the spotlight. Right. &gt;&gt; If you want to have that kind of a position, do like Seymour did and hang your head in an apple crate, &gt;&gt; in an orange crate, &gt;&gt; and pray quietly on the platform, believing that God will have his will and way. If he can't trust you with little things, how could he trust you with big things? I saw people reaching to take something that they had already accepted and wanted to trade it. &gt;&gt; It's selfish ambition. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something, that one little Ethiopian unic who was out there in that chariot, &gt;&gt; he was responsible for a move of God striking a nation. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it must have been prophetic because if you go to Jerusalem today, you'll see tens of thousands of Ethiopians &gt;&gt; who live in Israel by making aliyah by the right of return because they are part of of they're Jews. They they converted. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because of the witness, &gt;&gt; but they're really believers in Jesus Yeshua, the Messiah. and they have to live a Jewish life, even a kippa on their head because the only way to get out of the of the war and poverty years ago on uh Ethiopia was to come out on planes and and and in order to do that and be accepted in Israel, they had to claim their Jewishness, which was granted to them after many years of fighting in the laws and in the courts. And once it did, let me tell you, those big jumbo jets went in there and brought those Ethiopian Jews out, secret believers. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How do you know? Because when we go to the marketplace, when we go in public in Jerusalem and in Israel, there'll be, you know, many Jewish people will maybe nod their head or greet us. Oh no. When you come to the Ethiopians, they show all of their snow white teeth. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They grin. They smile. They poke you in the rib. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. They want you to know I know what you are and I am also that living here in the land. Because the word of the Lord, the spirit of God caught a an apostle away, put him down there. Understand thou what thou readest? He said, I don't have a clue. How could I understand except somebody teach me? And you know what? I I if it was offered perhaps to some of those in my experience, maybe they would have seen that one little man &gt;&gt; and they would have said, "I'd rather have a a public place. I'd rather have a celebrated ministry than that. And I I'll I'll trade you my Ethiopian unic for an opportunity to be called a preacher again. It broke. It broke me. Would it be sacrilegious to say it gutted me? It felt like a spear. Have we not come farther than that in this last day army &gt;&gt; that we would reject an assignment of any kind? I don't care what it is. If God wants me to have it, I started to tell you earlier when my grandmother passed away, there were things that she wanted each of us to have and the family started fighting immediately and they were baffled because there were things that were not assigned to anybody and and they didn't understand why I wasn't jumping for those. And I explained to them, I only want what she wanted me to have. &gt;&gt; If she didn't want me to particularly have it, I don't care who gets it. Get it. Take it. Enjoy it. However, &gt;&gt; I looked at my uncle and I said, "However, if she wrote on that paper that she wanted me to have it, get your hands off of it." And he laughed because he knew I was serious. I just felt strongly. All I want is is the inheritance that was to be mine. I don't want yours. &gt;&gt; I I don't want his. I don't want hers. But if I know my big mama wanted me to have it, I want it. And that's all. That's all. That's all there is to it. And And so everything went very smooth. Very smooth. Mostly smooth. Mostly smooth. because someone discovered that my Lincoln Town Car was probably more valuable than what they got. That freezer or that or that uh, you know, chest of drawers they were fighting for, they they weren't too happy when they kept reading. Didn't seem as uh beneficial as a paid for Lincoln Town Car, did it? But, uh, anyway, I didn't need it particularly. Well, I kind of did, but I didn't have to have a Lincoln. But I wanted it because she wanted me to have it. &gt;&gt; You ought to be so. &gt;&gt; You ought to be so. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I don't have to do anything that I'm not supposed to do. But if I know that Holy Ghost, if I know that Jesus wants me to do it, I'm not going to stand here and bargain and try to trade my destiny scroll, my holy assignment in for somebody else's &gt;&gt; who I want to be like. That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't care. You tell them I said so. I don't care how many belt buckles they wear. &gt;&gt; I don't care how many bolo ties they wear, how many cowboy hats they wear, how many horses they ride. &gt;&gt; They'll never be him. &gt;&gt; They may imitate the prophet, but they'll never be him. &gt;&gt; That wasn't their assignment. &gt;&gt; Just be your be your assignment. Just be what God called you to be and quit forfeiting. I got to hurry cuz I'm just I'm just I'm just off now. I got to come back because it's time to go and and and I haven't said lot &gt;&gt; even after noticing listen they they they started reaching for uh glory things that seem more glorious while deeper weightier assignments would pass by them without any effort at all to claim them. I saw a few individuals who even after noticing their own name on the assignment on a tag, what looked like a tag, pull back almost in disgust. You were here when I read when I spoke this, weren't you? &gt;&gt; At the nature of the mission and all the excuses I heard. I could hear individual voices of both men and women explaining to invisible invisible listeners the many reasons why they were would be unable to fulfill that specific assignment. I heard people even going back to their childhood back to their generation ago and explaining with excuses of why they would never be able to do a certain thing because you know I was brought up a certain way and you know what happened and you know how this happened and you know how this went. Oh God have mercy. You're you're you're living in the past. &gt;&gt; Live in the present. &gt;&gt; You can do anything God wants you to do. &gt;&gt; I I saw I saw uh I and excuses and I saw misplaced hunger and thirst. There was so much of it. I saw many people uninterested, distracted, procrastinating with their preparations. prayers left unpayed, meals unfasted, it was slackness, it was slumber, it was unconcerned. And I don't know how to say this exactly, but according to scripture, we come here with a purpose and a predetermined destiny. I believe we can fall out of God's perfect will. But just to lay a foundation here, we can drift into a permissive will. And when we come back to the perfect will, we pray that God will redeem the time and that anything we miss while we were cold and different and backsliding or whatever you do or whatever you want to call it, encumbered by snares and troubles of life. We're always believing that God will redeem that and restore it to us. But I saw something in the night and I don't know where to place it. I'm not sure exactly how to theologically place it because I saw that there were things that God intended to accomplish, things he wanted, things he desired to do through our lives, but I saw them filtering down like trickling down to other people because many have not been willing. &gt;&gt; We can't even be faithful to church. &gt;&gt; We're going to win nations. We're going to have effect. We're going to we're going to cast the devils out. We're going to heal the sick at Walmart. We can't even press through our own infirmity. &gt;&gt; Oh, ouch. &gt;&gt; That went over like a lead balloon, didn't it? &gt;&gt; But I You just have to You just have to experience this. You experience this and you'd call it exactly like I'm calling it. Right. Right. filtering down. I've always sort of in my mind, well, then it's just held in reserve for us until we get ready to come back and obey God and his perfect will. But that is not what I saw in the night. What I saw was it was nearly it was bypassing. &gt;&gt; I said, how horrible, how tragic that these promises would bypass some, but it was trickling down to others. And I saw that and I asked, you know, I prayed into it. I'm stumbling telling it because I want to be careful how I say it. But God put a piece in my heart and he let me know that there's a remedy for that and there's a prevention for that. And that is if we all just get willing as fast as we can. If ye be willing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Ready to submit to him as fast as we can because I I I don't I don't mind you getting good things from God. I don't mind you doing some of the things that I'm called to do, but I want mine. I'm not jealous over what he's called you to do or what he wants you to do. But what he wants me to do, I want to do it. &gt;&gt; And so if I were you this morning, I would, this is what I've done. If I were you this morning, I'd make it a serious concern in my life to say, "Lord, I'm stepping up. &gt;&gt; I just saw that many are putting things off just like you've got all the time in the world." None of us do. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter how old or how young. That's not how God does these things. Now, I want to tell you how sharp a and how how uh vigilant and diligent Sister Williams was when she began to express to Olivia the things that had been told her. She said, "I want to order some more uh Gospels of John. I I I I have uh three ministries left and that I'm doing, I think it was. and and I'm having a prayer meeting at night with my sister and my nephews and I'm handing out these and and what and and something and she said, "I I've got to get busy. I've got to get it done because there's nothing like the reality again of of of of seeing a moment of your vulnerability." And when you see your life like a drop of vapor on the glass, &gt;&gt; don't let it be too late &gt;&gt; for you to grab &gt;&gt; your destiny purpose and do something about it. &gt;&gt; Now, when that enemy moves on her, she might she might look at it a different way and this is the end. I don't know how. But I'm telling you, in in that moment, I think it was exactly holy clarity that moved over her in a in a very bad situation. And and she began to plan the future. And this is how we should respond. &gt;&gt; I saw many were putting things off like they had all the time in the world. Doesn't matter how old or young. There's not that's not how God does. None of us have time to get done what we've been called to get done. We have to do it now. Now is the time. And we are not the ones who get to decide the timing. We can't say, "Lord, I I'd like to do that when I get old. I'd like to do that when I get married. I'd like to do that when the children are raised." &gt;&gt; And I said that morning, and I'm reading it, and I'm saying again this morning, I need to know you're hearing me. Yes. &gt;&gt; For me, this is so critical and so serious. I I can't help it. I I hope you don't feel that it's just much to do, much to do over over something small. I think this is the I think this is I I really believe our future hangs in this kind of understanding. &gt;&gt; You you you've got it's now. &gt;&gt; Well, I I'm not equipped. I'm not. If you're willing and obedient, you're either going to forfeit destiny purposes or you're going to fulfill them. &gt;&gt; Romans 11:29, would you put that up quickly? It's 137. I want to take 10 more minutes or so. Forfeite is not God changing his mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 11:29, for the gifts and callings of God are without repentance. God does not revoke his eternal purposes. &gt;&gt; If it was his will, it's his will. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; But forfeite happens because that was the word that was given in the experience. Forefeature happens when man refuses when man neglects or disqualifies himself from walking in the destiny purposes of God. &gt;&gt; Let me give you the definition of forfeite. Are you are you okay? &gt;&gt; Are you sure you're all right? forfeite means the loss of a right, the loss of a privilege or the loss of an inheritance as a consequence of neglect, refusal or disqualification. It is not stolen by another, but it's surrendered by the one to whom it belonged. &gt;&gt; Let me give you the spiritual definition. The definition of spiritual forfeite. Spiritual forfeite is the surrender of God-given opportunity, calling or inheritance through unbelief, neglect, fear, disobedience, or misplaced desire. It is not God's failure to give, but it's man's failure to claim. Yes. &gt;&gt; And once he has claimed the cause of God, &gt;&gt; he has to steward them &gt;&gt; and not squander them, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And not waste them. &gt;&gt; Just let me get out of some of the debt I'm under. &gt;&gt; It's a reasonable It's a reasonable thought. Wouldn't it be great if we could be completely as individuals out of debt and then say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; I'm ready to be." &gt;&gt; But how likely is that? And why would you hang your destiny scroll &gt;&gt; in the balance &gt;&gt; when it's your opportunity? Somebody say, "I don't even know what I'm supposed to do." It's, you know what? I'm not only talking about uh you're supposed to be a teacher to the in the five-fold ministry or you're supposed to have a healing. I'm not I'm not only talking about that. I'm talking about you're to be an overcoming Christian. &gt;&gt; You're to be a believer who's in control of his emotions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and putting away childish things &gt;&gt; instead of out in the yard when tragedy strikes, when a problem comes up, giving the rest of the family silent treatment. Your children need your voice. &gt;&gt; Amen, sir. &gt;&gt; They need your tongue. They need your words. &gt;&gt; They need to know &gt;&gt; that you're there for them. But I'm going through. Yes, of course. Of course, we all are going through. &gt;&gt; But in our moment of going through, we cannot forget our responsibility. That's right. &gt;&gt; We can't forget that even in our going through, we have a responsibility to our wife, &gt;&gt; for what she's going through &gt;&gt; and our children, our teenagers, our adult married children &gt;&gt; for what they're going through. We don't get to check out as believers because life has gotten a little tough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're needed. &gt;&gt; The society at large is a fatherless society &gt;&gt; and it's producing sissies &gt;&gt; because there are no fathers. The Bible said there there you know we the need the need for spiritual fathers. You you can't mentor somebody else's children when you won't mentor your own. &gt;&gt; It's our first assignment. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I I wish somebody would remind us when we're when we're saying I do &gt;&gt; that it's more than the honeymoon. &gt;&gt; It's I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. Because it's my it's my privilege and it's my responsibility to raise emotionally healthy children. No matter what I'm dealt with, no matter the fact that I didn't have a dad, no matter the fact that I didn't know how, no matter the fact that you didn't know how, we have a responsibility. And what do we do when we have something to do and we don't know how? Somebody said, "Google." No. Go on our knees. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we say, "I can't." &gt;&gt; But you can. Amen. &gt;&gt; We come together on the discipline issue because it's necessary and needful. &gt;&gt; And we come together and we make compromises and we agree the best that we can or it will haunt us, harass us, and trouble everybody around us because we sherked our own duty. &gt;&gt; So listen folks, that's part of destiny assignment. Again, it's not all a pullpit ministry. &gt;&gt; You want to be a priest, be the priest in your home. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Keep your keep your emotions in check and do what God has called you to do. You're going to mess up. You're going to fail. You're going to Of course. &gt;&gt; But don't let your mantle filter down to somebody else. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So, so don't get your eyes on grandeur. Get your eyes on just knowing. Lord, just show me. Let me be a Let me be a faithful amener. And may I not just amen with my mouth. May I amen with my life. Let me I'm not a singer, but let me support those who do sing specials. &gt;&gt; Let me pull on the gift in their life. Let me worship while they sing. &gt;&gt; You know, it doesn't have to be and the scroll is unrolled and God says, "I want you to be Find what you can do. &gt;&gt; Do what you can do and wait on your assignment to become clear. Stop bargaining with it. &gt;&gt; Quit trying to advance yourself. &gt;&gt; Push yourself forward. Live without a selfish ambition. &gt;&gt; Let God exalt. Let God make a way. Let God open the door. &gt;&gt; 50 years in a few weeks. September the 20th. We're celebrating in October. But September the 20th of this year, this month, 50 years ago, I preached my first sermon. Boy, no wonder I feel old this morning. I am, but I started pretty early. And I never made one phone call that I recall. And I thought about it pretty hard. I'm passing through. Boy, there were times, brother Gley, I needed an offering. I was living by offerings, not by tithe for some of those years. And brother Bill J, he's he's on up there. He's been through some strokes and but he's we're hoping he's he's positive about coming to the banquet in the service of the meeting. I hope he can. He'd come to me sometime in a revival away from where he was in Tennessee. I'd be up somewhere Virginia, West Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, sometimes somewhere else in Tennessee. and he'd come up after the service and he said, "I didn't see very much in the pan tonight." He said, "You think you'll have enough gas money to get home or get to the next place?" I said, "God always provides." He said, "Well, I got a 50 here. Let me give you this 50 and that ought to help a little bit." And it did then. Boy, that was two tanks. tank and a half in a little vehicle and and and just I know it's a little out of the way, but just come by tomorrow morning and let Shirley and Mama Faith cook you some biscuit and gravy and at least you'll have a tank full of gas and a big old meal, big old mountain breakfast to get you home. Brother, sister, that means more than I can I don't have words. You you don't have words looking back. God always made a way. &gt;&gt; He always made a way. Brother Henry Green came to the meetings and God would use him. He would sometimes stand and prophesy over the ministry that God had given me. And every other preacher in the room except Brother Dan Dasley would look at him like he had lost his mind. But he believed it. He obeyed what he felt. And he'd do the same. He'd call every Sunday night. How'd it go, son? How was the meeting? How was the revival where you were last week? How did the people respond? Do you need anything? I know there's just a handful now. Can we help you in any way? Folks, God will always &gt;&gt; never had to say, "I'm passing by. I'm coming through. I just want to worship with you, but I want you to know I'm coming." I never had to say, "I have a Friday night open. I have a Sunday open. I have a Saturday night open." Because I made up my mind when I started. I'll do this as long as God opens doors and as long as God makes a way and as long as God will help me, I'll do it. And he has and I have &gt;&gt; because if you accept what he's asking you to do, he will make a way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every time. &gt;&gt; I'm not done yet, but I will be. I don't know why I put this up here. I wasn't quite through with it. Forefeature is not God changing his mind. It's when people let it slip through their fingers because they're focus self-centered and focused on their own burden, their own need, their own struggle, their own battle. And the destiny purposes of God are filtering out there. Be faithful. You don't have to have an invitation to pray. &gt;&gt; You don't even need a scroll to do that. &gt;&gt; Pray. Prepare the atmosphere. Get ready for what God's going to do. We're open. We're ready to hear &gt;&gt; what he has to say. &gt;&gt; I'll bring some of this another time. There's so much here that he laid on my heart. And uh if he did, then he'll give me an opportunity to share it with you. God's always got a he's always got somebody who will take the load. Closing with this quotation. And I haven't laid the foundation for it, but I want to give you something from the messenger. He said, this is uh speak to the rock and it shall give forth his water. It must have been a hot morning. Everybody was all confused and frustrated because all night long the cattle had bowled. You musicians slip quietly up here, would you please? The children had cried and the people had fussed and argued and quarreled and poor Moses. It was a dreadful time for him. You see, he had come down into Egypt and had brought the children out according to the promise of God and was leading them to the promised land, a land flowing with milk and honey, with a promise of God to protect them and to supply everything they had need of until they reached this glorious land flowing with milk and honey. Moses, a God called servant, ordained prophet, pillar of fire over him, following him, confirming the words that he spoke by signs and wonders on his road to the promised land with the children. A very definite antitype or type rather of the journey today. We're on our road to the promised land. And we're being led by the great Holy Spirit as and as they was led in the natural. We are led in the spiritual to this great promised land that God made the promise and gave to us. God had promised them to supply all their needs. Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; But their carnal mind &gt;&gt; but their carnal mind had taken them out of the divine will of God and had given them a desert route. You mean that wasn't God's perfect will? No. It was what he had to do. He gave them a desert route. God had promised them to supply all their needs. But their carnal mind had taken them out of the divine will of God and had given them. Read it again. &gt;&gt; That's a whole lot of it today. He says that's what's the matter with many of our churches. They taken the carnal intellectual route and has been cut off the supplies of God's blessings of healing and power, the baptism of the Holy Ghost and have took Oh, God. &gt;&gt; They've took the desert out. Therefore, we have arguings and fusses and stews and complaints and we're focused on silly little childish things while the while the destiny scrolls and purposes of our life are floating by us and someone else is reaching out to take a hold of what was to be ours. I'll show I can show you, brother. I didn't know at the time how how many times I could show you through the scripture. Look at Saul. God said, "You're chosen through Samuel the prophet. You're chosen to lead this people." The same God came back and said, "Because of your pride, &gt;&gt; I am wrestling this kingdom. I am taking this kingdom out of your hand and I'm giving it to your neighbor because I know what he will do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it scripturally is it possible to lose your death? Uhhuh. Is it possible to forfeit and lose the duration of what God could God have continued to use Saul? According to scripture, he could have continued to lo to use Saul and he did use Saul as long as Saul was little. Amen. &gt;&gt; In his own eyes. And if you read that carefully, you'll see the agony. If you think that Samuel marched in there like a holy holy and a prideful prophet and just slapped Saul around and said he was so broken. &gt;&gt; He said, "I loved Saul. I loved you. You do. You do. If you if God puts us a king in your life, if he puts a leader in your life, puts a mentor in your life, a good friend, and you love them. Not only spirit love, but you love their flesh. Brother Green said, "I don't know. God judges heart." He said, 'Brother Shelley, I didn't just love Brother Brandham because he was a prophet. I didn't just love him because he was a messenger to the church age. He said, 'I I learned I just loved I loved him. I loved his flesh. I loved the man. I loved the man. I just loved the man. And I loved the call on his life. Saul was loved by Samuel and it broke his heart to tell him, "I'm taking God says, "I'm taking the kingdom back." You're forfeiting it because of your own pride, because of your own decisions. You've lost the call. So, what will you do? Will you do nothing? If you're here today and your own messy life has caused you not to be able to fulfill your destiny purposes, what will you do? Will you just sit on the pew and coast? &gt;&gt; Okay. If if you if you if you've double married, if you've done this or that and you can't stand up here, is that the end of you? Can't you repent? Can't you do something? &gt;&gt; Can't you try to build somebody else up? &gt;&gt; Can't you help your brother? Can't you help your sister? Can you get out of your mentality of a celebrity and realize &gt;&gt; you can use a rake? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can't you do something? Yes, &gt;&gt; but Saul was out of his mind because when the spirit of the Lord lifted off of him, he was bonkers. Don't don't you don't have to wonder anymore. Can you forfeit? Yeah, it's a whole lot of it today. He said the the intellectual route has been cut off, the blessings cut off, the healing and power and baptism of the Holy Ghost. They've took the desert route. Therefore, we've got these arguments and fusses and stews and complaints. But those who are still remaining in the way, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; it's joy unspeakable. &gt;&gt; You may do it. Can you do it with joy? Can you do it unto the Lord? I'm not lifting anybody up because I'm not going to put anybody down. I'm not going to do it. It's not my purpose. But it's amazing to see somebody pushing a lawnmower, dragging a hose with joy. Unbelievable. It was a joy to see people Monday with joy. No paycheck promised, just with joy. That's where we find that's where we can find doesn't mean that's all there ever is. But if a man can have more and temporarily be at peace with where God has placed and what and do it with joy instead of sitting back in the service stubborn really wanting somebody to feel sorry for them. You're the one you messed up. I didn't mess up. You messed up. &gt;&gt; Now, can't you do something for the Lord? Hasn't he continued to do something for you? &gt;&gt; Would you just let it keep falling around you? He said, "No, but how how the real born again church is moving on to the promised land. We are &gt;&gt; the promise of eternal life." Amen. A land flowing with eternal life where there's no more sickness, death, sorrow for nothing to harm. now. But when carnal minds began to come among them, &gt;&gt; listen, if you come in here Sunday &gt;&gt; and you pass the piano on your way in, just come on in anyway and don't even worry. Don't even wonder why the piano is sitting in the vestibule and not on the platform. You didn't come to see the piano. &gt;&gt; You came to worship God. &gt;&gt; If it's there, it's because somebody felt like that's where it ought to be. And a counsel was made. And you know how God did counsels, don't you? &gt;&gt; Within himself. Yes. &gt;&gt; And he felt the uncction of the Lord. And all of a sudden, I think that we would be better served by uh Sister Laurel, who's there here this morning today. She's going to play from the vestibule. That ought not to throw you off. &gt;&gt; What? What? David, I I think now from now on, you ought to be strumming that guitar over there. And if you're willing, it's because you know that it's something you can do for the Lord. And if you're willing and you accept the destiny scroll of that, it's not going to matter to you if you have to stand on your head to do it. What if I said, "I think we can find a place for you under that table to play your guitar for Jesus." I'm being &gt;&gt; facitious, &gt;&gt; but I hope you're hearing the point. It's just that desperate. It's It's that rubber meet moment. It's that It's that real. &gt;&gt; You're waiting on an explanation that never may come. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Serve God. &gt;&gt; If I would that he tried till I come. What is that to you? Jesus said, "Why are you worried about John? &gt;&gt; What about John, Lord? What about John, Lord? What will John do, Lord? Woo. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You ain't got time. I don't have time to worry what John will do. Will he fail? Will he succeed? Will he &gt;&gt; one of these days John might come stumbling out of a cave somewhere? Because Jesus said, "If I would that he tried till I come." What is that to you? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you be shocked &gt;&gt; if you get raptured with some old man? Who are you? I'm John. I've been living up here in the woods somewhere cuz Jesus said if Oh, don't you Why don't you make a clip and show that one around that crazy false doctrine? It's none of my business. It's none of my business. It's none of my business. If God says we we we need to do it, let's just do it. Let's just do it. Let's not wait on the long explanation. Just do what God says. Let's just be willing. Oh my goodness, Zach. I think of you. I thought of you the morning that this came. I thought of others with destiny purposes. And life is hard and it's busy. And nobody tells you because they're all afraid to say it like it really is. And nobody tells mothers. The reality is it gets a to be a lot too much at times. It consumes all that you the strength you have and the time and the energy you have. But if God blessed you with them, he didn't do it so that you could have an excuse to say, "I can't do what God wanted me to do because of all these kids." You sure enjoyed getting them here. You have to find a way, Lord. If I can't do it all now, if I can't do all you called me to do because I have to spread myself so thin, mama Ashley, mama's, I have to spread Liz. I have to spread myself, Kendra, so thin. And so I can't do all that I want to do and all that he's called me to do. Do something. Do something for him. Don't use these gifts as excuses. Don't do Don't use what God allows as an excuse to let somebody else take the load. If it's your if your name is on it, honey, there's nobody can do it like you can do it. Oh Jesus. The reality is, yes, in a church this size, you can always find somebody else to jump up. But the reality is, if God put your name on it, nobody then can do it like you can. I told sister Sharon at the last meal, she I know she is a often radiant and you think of her as 50ish, but the reality is she's not. She would be a senior by anybody's free coffee discount. and her joy is just to serve. And I told her the last one, I'm so glad you don't charge by the hour. I don't want to I I I'm not trying to put somebody down by putting somebody up. I I'm not doing any I'm not trying to do anything like that. I'm just saying please don't forfeit your opportunity by making some excuse. You can pray. &gt;&gt; Some of us don't even read our Bible. We don't hear the prophet's message. How can we get spiritual? How can we be closer to the Lord if we're not feeding on life? &gt;&gt; Okay, you can't do sometimes what other people can do. But you can pray, you can read, you can eat. &gt;&gt; You You're going to come and try to teach some of correct us on scripture when you haven't picked up your Bible in a year. Some of you, this is the tr truth. I love you. Some of you don't even know where your Bible is. If I ask you to produce it, you'd have to hunt it. Some of you may be like me. You've got 50. You might have to hunt the one you're looking for. But I'm never too far away from that one. I know where it is because I use it. Yes, I have it on my phone. Yes, I have it on my laptop. Yes, I have it on my computer. But I use it. It's a sword to me. &gt;&gt; Don't let life get so busy. You don't have to. I don't care. You don't have to sit down and read 10 chapters. &gt;&gt; Read a half a chapter in Jesus' name and say, "Lord, help me. I've given you this. You deserve more. You deserve more. But right now, this is what I have. And I'm instead of listening to some song or some uh podcast or something when you're walking for exercise or whatever it is you do or drive to work or drive home, feed. &gt;&gt; Feed. Get the spiritual man ready so that when the anointings come and the callings fall, you grab yours. Yes. &gt;&gt; And in that moment, you don't try to disqualify yourself and say, "I'm not worthy." He wouldn't have put your name on it. &gt;&gt; If he wasn't going to help you do it, let's stand. If you put your name on it, it's because he knew that in time. &gt;&gt; You would let him fill you with his life. &gt;&gt; Oh. I don't want to forfeit. I want to fulfill. &gt;&gt; Every church is sovereign. And &gt;&gt; the man is going to answer. I'm going to answer. Every man's going to answer for what he does, what he allows, what he doesn't allow. how he does it. It's all It's all going to matter. It's heavy. And some people think it's kind of ridiculous for a church to feel like they have their own commission, their own purpose. I think it makes a lot of sense. If every church was just alike and did it all just alike, that would be a denomination. There's plenty of them. But a church has to find a vision. It has to find a purpose. It has to find a scroll, a commission, a reason for being. And then they have to run hard as a body of people. One vision. running hard after what God would have us to do as a people, what God would have us to do individually. And so, if you hear us focusing for the next few months on this house and what God's called us to do, uh, don't let it discourage you or distract you or confuse you. The only way to show the house to the house is to show the house to the house. Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we just have to see not only where we get it right and where we don't get it right. We just have to see why we're together. &gt;&gt; You should ask, you should ask somebody sometime, "Why are you here? How'd you get here? What brought you here?" Try not to say, "Why are you here?" There's a bunch of nuts in this house. But here's what makes the difference. They've been threaded to the right bolt. If you wanted carbon copy people, if you wanted plastic church members, plastic message believers, they're dime a dozen. I don't mind nuts. I don't mind unique. I don't mind eccentric. I don't mind strange. I've It's It's a I've I'm a I'm a strange magnet. I can I seem to draw oddities. But as long as we're threaded to him, we love one another. We can appreciate one another. And we don't try to force somebody else to be like us. We want them to be who God made them to serve the greater good. I feel I feel the Lord even in all of this. I feel him. I I I it's not about feeling him, but I feel him. I feel Jesus. [Music] I feel Jesus. [Music] I feel Jesus. [Music] He's in this place. [Music] And my soul does burn within. [Music] &gt;&gt; Glory. He's in this place. We'll speed it up in a little while. Let's sing it just like that again. I feel Jes. [Music] Have you been sitting down on your scroll? I feel Jesus. Have you let your past define your present? I feel Jesus. He's in this place. And my soul does burn within me. I feel Jesus. [Music] He's in. Have you let not knowing exactly what you were to do keep you from doing anything? I feel Jesus. And even if I didn't feel him, I'm going to serve him. I feel Jesus. Oh, I feel Jesus. He's in this place. [Music] Have you sat in the seat of a scornful? &gt;&gt; Have you criticized others who are doing more than you were doing? Now is your opportunity to square that up. Today is your opportunity to square that up and say, "Lord, I'll take the baton. may not look like what I thought it was going to look like, but I'll do something for the kingdom. I feel Lord, these are some of the best folks. It's the cream of the crop. [Music] Help us today. I don't want to forfeit. They don't want to forfeit. I don't want you to have to take something from me and give it to somebody else because I wasn't faithful or because I got big in my own eyes. &gt;&gt; We just want to be faithful. I feel Jesus. If you feel like you ought to come and stand with him, come. You don't have to come to pray. You can pray where you are. But if you just feel like you want to move forward, do it. I feel &gt;&gt; I know it's late. I know you're tired. I &gt;&gt; Jesus. [Music] Oh, I feel Jesus. is in this place. And my soul and my soul, [Music] I feel Jesus. [Music] Just play that a moment when you're sitting in your home and you are overwhelmed. [Music] All you see is what's wrong. You can't even see what's right and you're just ruminating on it and it's just rolling over and over in your head. You're getting lower and lower, lower. If you could just catch yourself, if you could just awaken in that moment like the prodigal and you could just say, "Lord, everything I've been thinking sort of the way it looks, but I better use this time &gt;&gt; instead of feeling sorry for myself and my family, and I I ought to use this time to tell you that you've been so faithful to me. &gt;&gt; I've lived my life in the goodness of the Lord, even when it was rough. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to tell you sitting right here, &gt;&gt; I've lived in the goodness of the Lord and I don't have any reason to complain. &gt;&gt; If you'll just help me, Lord, to get up and give you praise, I want to do it. Don't waste a moment. Don't waste an opportunity to have to feel strength and to be helped by mulling around on all that's wrong. He's right. &gt;&gt; We used to sing when I was young, Jesus is right for whatever's wrong in your life. And it's true. Doesn't matter what you're carrying. He's enough. &gt;&gt; He's big enough. He's God enough. &gt;&gt; You say, "But my questions are so big." Well, he's big answers. &gt;&gt; If you believe that, say amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's got big answers. &gt;&gt; If I called somebody's name, don't let it be a burden to you. It was it was just a way to make it personal. I just remembered that morning after that experience. I just started thinking of things that God had said to different ones. And we're I was going to read to you if I could have got to it. Habachok, write the vision. &gt;&gt; Make it plain on table so that he may run that readeth it. &gt;&gt; Though it wait, &gt;&gt; though the vision tar, &gt;&gt; wait for it, &gt;&gt; the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. Maybe you're burdened today with hope deferred and it didn't happen the way you wanted and you're afraid it's all downhill from here. That's a lie of the enemy. &gt;&gt; There's a place for you on Zion. &gt;&gt; There's a capstone coming for you. I feel Jesus. He's in this place. Oh Jesus, help me and my soul. [Music] Oh, [Music] help me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let me just encourage you to cry out, call out to the Lord right now for whatever it is you want to tell him. Do it right now. Lord, here we are. &gt;&gt; Just say, "Jesus, here I am. I don't want to waste another moment. &gt;&gt; Show me what I can do. Equip me. Anoint me. Make a way. Help me carry the load. Help me stay out of my head &gt;&gt; and in your word. [Music] &gt;&gt; I feel Jesus. I [Music] Oh, I hear [Music] Oh, [Music] and my soul [Music] I feel Jesus. [Music] He's in this place. Let the Lord help you help somebody else. Let the Lord use you. Everybody that will, let the Lord use you for just a moment to be strength to somebody else. You say, "I don't have any strength of my own." You'd be surprised what you have when you start trying to help somebody else get a little strength. You don't [Music] oh Jesus. No, &gt;&gt; I take mine. Lord, let Sister Rebecca take hers. [Music] &gt;&gt; Woo! Mountains move. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When faith responds, &gt;&gt; let her faith respond. [Music] Show her you're still a mountain mover. &gt;&gt; Yes, you are. &gt;&gt; You'll make a way where there is no way. If you've got any strength at all, give it to somebody else. &gt;&gt; Just join hands. Touch somebody. [Music] What can I do? &gt;&gt; Young people, what can you do? Ask him. Volunteer willingly &gt;&gt; in the day of his power. &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, what can I do? Settle my mind. Settle my heart. &gt;&gt; Make me hungry. [Music] &gt;&gt; Give me a hunger that this world cannot satisfy. [Music] What an army. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; What an army. I see. What an army in this house. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. I will tell him. &gt;&gt; Somebody tell him, "Yes, Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; I will. [Music] What can I do? I will tell your stubborn will give way. You keep getting in my way. You stubborn will. [Music] I pun you beneath the blood. My own stubborn will. I tell you, bow to the will of the father. Get out of my way. [Music] &gt;&gt; Sing that song just a minute, will you? Thank you. I feel Jesus. [Music] I feel Jesus &gt;&gt; in this place. &gt;&gt; He's in this place. &gt;&gt; It's an awful thing to have to say. &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to just tell. Somebody ought to just say, "My feelings don't matter." Faith is what matters. &gt;&gt; I'm taking this by faith. &gt;&gt; I'm putting my anchor down in faith. He's in this place. Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh, I feelus &gt;&gt; faith. Oh, I feel Jesus. And I feel Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; He's in this place. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's in this place. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Come live big. Live big and look my soul. &gt;&gt; Live big in him, Lord Jesus. be glorified in him, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lead him, direct him, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; I feel Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let another stake go down. Jesus &gt;&gt; in this place. &gt;&gt; May not give up an inch. may not forfeit one inch &gt;&gt; of what's his [Music] &gt;&gt; giving courageous faith &gt;&gt; daring faith &gt;&gt; bulldo faith &gt;&gt; he's in this place he's in this place he's in this place and my soul &gt;&gt; is in this place [Music] within. &gt;&gt; Where's Ashley? &gt;&gt; I can't see or tell her to come. &gt;&gt; I feel Jesus. &gt;&gt; He's in this place. &gt;&gt; He's in this place. &gt;&gt; Keep singing. I feel Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, and I feel Jesus. &gt;&gt; And I feel Jes. &gt;&gt; I have a burden from the Lord for you. It's not com just human compassion. &gt;&gt; I feel &gt;&gt; I just feel a burden for you. And it's okay. It's all right. &gt;&gt; It's not anything terrible. I just &gt;&gt; I just want you &gt;&gt; to just yield to him and be strengthened in such a time as this. &gt;&gt; It's a heavy load. It's a lot. &gt;&gt; But he wouldn't have put it there. He wouldn't have allowed it this way if it wasn't for a reason. &gt;&gt; Be his strength, Lord Jesus. She's giving out and giving out and giving out. Let your strength be hers. &gt;&gt; I feel Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let your peace be hers. &gt;&gt; And you see the warfare of her mind. &gt;&gt; And you hear the battle. You see the battle. You're aware of the battle. &gt;&gt; Well, she has victory. And she is the Lord's victory. And I'm asking you today, Lord, for a spiritual IV. I didn't do this to embarrass her. &gt;&gt; Be a spiritual IV tour today. Lord, let your life flow [Music] &gt;&gt; just hope and help and strength. [Music] Let the mind of Christ, let the mind of Christ, Let the mind of Christ settle Let the spirit and presence of the Lord settle in this home. I feel you. &gt;&gt; Even in the in the burdens, even in the stresses, even in the responsibilities, [Music] &gt;&gt; let the peace of the Lord settle. Let the presence of God, let the angels of the Lord fill that hill. Let that hill be full of heavenly reinforcement [Music] within me. &gt;&gt; May she not have to forfeit. &gt;&gt; Not one destiny scroll. &gt;&gt; May she fulfill everything you give her. The gift of a song writer. &gt;&gt; You've given her many gifts and talents. Lord, may she not have to give up one of them. May they each find their place. And until they do, may she find comfort in who she is in you. &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; we break every lie. We break every lie of the enemy. We thank you for our sister today. We celebrate her today. [Music] &gt;&gt; Believe in you to help and strengthen her. And my soul does is that all right burn within &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; This precious little woman, &gt;&gt; sweet Aana. Lord, &gt;&gt; be gracious and merciful to her. &gt;&gt; Oh, cover her with your peace. Cover her with your peace. &gt;&gt; She's beautiful to us. We love her. &gt;&gt; We want to see her at perfect peace. &gt;&gt; She's so wonderful. Lord, you're so good. &gt;&gt; Let your peace be upon this precious woman. &gt;&gt; You got the easy job. Thank you for this one. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Burn within &gt;&gt; now. Lord, I've watched it be possible that even the responsibility of a new baby be strained. &gt;&gt; Instead of just drain, &gt;&gt; let that little peace that he carries, let it bring peace to mama. Let it bring peace to the home. I feel Jesus. &gt;&gt; God David has a call on his life. &gt;&gt; I feel Jesus. &gt;&gt; May you find it. &gt;&gt; May he find it, Lord. &gt;&gt; I feel Jesus. He &gt;&gt; tell David to come here a minute. We'll go home in a minute. And my soul does burn within me. I feel Jesus. [Music] He &gt;&gt; My goodness. Where is he? &gt;&gt; I can't stand much longer. Hurry, David. And I feel Jesus, &gt;&gt; Lord. I know there are destiny scrolls &gt;&gt; that belong to David. &gt;&gt; I know he has the desire. I know he has the burden at times. &gt;&gt; I know he's felt the pull at times. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm asking you to protect that &gt;&gt; even in this season. my soul. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want you to show him today &gt;&gt; that's standing right next to him. &gt;&gt; It's his first ministry. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's his first congregation. &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray, oh God, that he would not see &gt;&gt; his family. I don't think he does, but I I wouldn't want him to ever see it as a burden. Lord, &gt;&gt; may he see it as an opportunity. for priesthood. &gt;&gt; Raise him up today &gt;&gt; as a priest &gt;&gt; to his precious wife, &gt;&gt; these amazing children that you've given them. &gt;&gt; May he find strength and grace and health to pour into them. &gt;&gt; May he never take from them. May he only pour into them. &gt;&gt; You will be his strength. &gt;&gt; You will be his validation. &gt;&gt; You will be his encouragement. &gt;&gt; May he give to them first. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; May he set a standard &gt;&gt; for others. May he feel an upward call. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Give him the courage to lay his hands on his wife's head &gt;&gt; in the in the in the in the privacy even of their own home and just say, "Jesus, fill this wife you've given me. Fill her with strength and help and hope. &gt;&gt; May he find ministry. &gt;&gt; May you use him. It's it's so necessary. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's not right. It's not normal. It's not God's order for her to look anywhere else for strength &gt;&gt; except to Jesus &gt;&gt; and to you, &gt;&gt; Lord. May he be that. &gt;&gt; Oh, these little children there. Here's a one so little it's he's hardly impressionable yet, but he will be. Everything he sees and everything he feels, everything Aiana feels &gt;&gt; will affect them. &gt;&gt; Oh, may they see daddy becoming a well, &gt;&gt; a well of rich life and strength and hope, &gt;&gt; water. us. &gt;&gt; It may not make any sense now, but I hope it will. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. &gt;&gt; It's easy. I just feel like in marriage it's so easy to criticize. I know I've done it. It's so easy to criticize. It's harder. It's actually harder to take courage and try to minister &gt;&gt; and try to build up cuz she knows everything there is to know about you. She knows all your strengths and your weaknesses. And it's hard sometimes to step out of husband and daddy role into a into a place of spiritual ministry. But we have to do it. &gt;&gt; We have to pastor our own families. We have to Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know why it was to be like this, but I just Okay, &gt;&gt; maybe it's because the Lord knows you all will just take it and not be &gt;&gt; feel like I'm pointing you out in some way. I'm not at all. &gt;&gt; I wished every man. I wished every daddy. I wished every husband. It's not too late for any of us [Music] &gt;&gt; to take that responsibility serious. &gt;&gt; Hear him call. Clean out your heel. [Music] You can't touch him. You will never &gt;&gt; just worship. Sing another song. Worship and go when you have to go. &gt;&gt; Here. Hallelu. He is here. Amen. [Music] He is here. Holy, holy, I will bless his name again. And he is here. Oh, listen closely. Hear him calling out your name. He is here. Oh, you can touch him. You will never be the same. And he is here. Hallelu. He is here. Amen. He is here. Holy, holy. I will bless his name again. And he is here. Listen closely. Hear him call out your name. He is here. You can touch him. You will never be the same. [Music] This is the time when trueers will worship him. And these are the days when my father's ways will be known to men. And this is the hour when the spirit's power will move again across this land. Lord, as we worship you in spirit and in truth, [Music] Oh, this is the time when trueers will worship him. [Music] And these are the days when my father's ways will be known to men. [Music] And this is the hour when the spirit's power it will move again. Oh, across this land, Lord, as we worship you in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; One more time. Sing that. &gt;&gt; Oh, and this is the time when trueers [Music] they will worship him. Hallelujah. And these are the days when my father's ways will be known to men. [Music] And this is the hour when the spirit's power oh it will move again. all across this land. Oh, as we worship him in spirit and in truth [Music] &gt;&gt; as we worship him &gt;&gt; in spirit and truth. I know it's very late. Would you go to one another right now and just love each other for just a moment? Would you just hug a sister, brother, embrace a brother? [Music] Lord, we're so thankful for each other. We're so thankful for our brothers and sisters. We're so thankful for what you've given us. I mean, do it. Really let somebody feel it. These are the days when my true how does it go? Will worship him. These are the days. These are the days when my father's ways will be known to men. And this is the hour when the spirit's power will move again across this land as we worship him in spirit and love you in truth. Sing that line. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Appreciate your prayers. When that anointing is like that, it feels like a 100 pound weight on my shoulders. They just bend. I feel the weight of them. Be seated just a moment. This won't take but a second. I'm sorry that it's nearly 3:00. But since nobody has church on Sunday night, you've had your Sunday morning and Sunday night all combined. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sister Deborah Gossman's birthday is is today. And they're faithful streamers. We send her love. And it's also Shiloh River's birthday today. Is she How old is she? Three. Uh would you all say happy birthday to her? Shiloh River. Happy birthday. [Applause] We've been doing a lot of things and making a lot of plans for camp meeting and we have done mockups and markdowns and draw. We drew lines and we've we figured a way to get more people in here. Yesterday they came and built a platform in the studio to get the camera up off the ground. We will take some of the furniture and equipment out of the studio if necessary and put seats in there. We have a way to put chairs here and there and some in the back. We don't want to do a a spill over if we don't have to. We want everybody to get in. Even if it's not as comfortable as we like for it to be, we can do it. We can make a way for 300 people, but it'll be tight. What a wonderful, glorious, hallelujah problem to have. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have now 221 people who are either our own church folks or those who have reached out to say we're coming for the banquet. Some of that is children but not babies. We do not have enough tables to to uh hold the the amount of people that we know are coming. nor do we have enough chairs. We'll mention perhaps that to you later, but we're going to have to do it. We have to have chairs and and tables for the for the folks to sit at. We bought quite a few last year, but we're going to need some more. Um the fellowship hall is big. It looks so big when it's empty, but when it gets people in there, it looks looks a little fuller, doesn't it? So, we're going to need to to locate purchase some more tables and chairs. What I'm doing now is to tell you two things. One is they they I didn't decide this, but it has been decided and I didn't veto it that we that we wear church clothes that we're coming. It says on the invitation semiformal. Well, I I don't know what that is. And I'm certainly not wearing a bow tie or anything like that. We're just going to dress up for church. So, if you wear church, no jeans, but if you're coming for church, let's let's let's make it a special for everyone who comes. And I didn't make that decision, but spread it around. We don't want to have to have somebody at the door saying, "You're not dressed for the wedding banquet." Um, just kidding. That was in my notes to talk about the but I didn't get that far. Uh, the other thing is if you know we have a we have some coming from the Netherlands, some coming from Iceland. This 221 again it includes our adults, most of our children, none of our babies, and then those who have said that they would be coming and and given RSVP because my wife sent out some invitations by text to people that we thought might be interested to come. There is a group coming from Arizona that is not included in this number and that could be up to 30 people. So, we don't know the the number, but we know they're coming. Some have even reached out this week to my wife to say we stream and we're not going to miss it. So, uh if you have told someone they could stay with you or if someone has told you we're coming and you haven't gotten the word to Sister Stacy that they will also be here for the banquet, it's important that we know. We feel like there may be people who show up that night who don't know that it's not a service and we have to make room for them as well. We can't say we can't say you don't have an invitation. You can't come in here. You're we're full. We have to do all we can. And so let's try to figure this out and and get numbers to her if we possibly can. 221, that's quite a crowd already. And uh if there are 20 or 30 coming from Tucson, that puts us over to 50. And that puts us getting close to where we know that we can even put that many tables. We have a plan, but the plan is it it will run out eventually. We have some uh special tables that we ordered and paid for. idea that would give the children a little little picnic-l like table and and uh maybe take up a little bit less space so we could all get in. But I I don't want to take your time. I just want you to know that we don't usually do things like this, but this time we have to be pretty serious about it. We have to let them know um the the caterers, we have to let them know uh by the first of October. So, um, is there anybody here that you know you've got somebody staying with you, but you're not sure if that number has been turned into Sister Stacy? Are there any of you that have family members coming and you know that they're coming and their their name has not been turned into Sister Stacy? If you're not a regular, if they're not a regular, if they come once a year or something like that, they're not going to be on the list and we need to know. Sister Martha raised her hand. So Charity said, "All right." Yes. I think a lot of the former Amish have been included. Yes. Yes. We have Zion and Solomon. Anybody else know of anybody? Sorry, Sister Beverly. We're waiting on them. Oh, you did? We sent them a invitation and waiting on their report, but they are coming. This number's Sister West too. Sarah wasn't sure. Maybe. Right. Maybe. So anyway, God bless you. You're dismissed to go. Please don't let us down in this matter if because if someone is coming and you know it, it's better to tell us so that we'll have plenty of food for them. It's going to be a wonderful spiritual Holy Ghost week of meetings. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let one more of your Don't let one more scroll pass you by. &gt;&gt; I love you. God bless you. I I know it's 3:00. More church than most people can handle. I'm glad you're not most people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Tuesday night.
