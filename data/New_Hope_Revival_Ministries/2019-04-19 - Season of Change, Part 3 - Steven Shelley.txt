our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right Weist in you the hope award [Music] well hello to you I'm pastor Stephen Shelley from New Hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama and I'm coming to you again today in partnership with brother Eric Erickson and all of the fine people at the gospel channel we appreciate the work that they are doing for the kingdom of God and we're we're not just partners in ministry but we're friends and we're brothers in Christ we appreciate brother Erickson he was here with us in Alabama several times through the years and he was actually here when we dedicated this studio to the glory of God it was such a delight to have him to come all the way from Iceland to Alabama and to pray over this equipment and help us to dedicate it for the use of the Lord Jesus Christ we love him we love his family his children and grandchildren and we pray for all of them just like they were our family and we love the staff at the gospel Channel they have treated me so many times like a king when I visit them in Iceland their hospitality is so warm and so so lovely so beautiful I have been fed amazing food and I learned to drink good coffee while I was there the first time and I've tasted a few things that well I've never wanted to taste them again but it was it was good at the time so I want you to know that the relationship that we have with the gospel channel is deeper than you just hearing me say we're in partnership with them we truly are and our folks at the New Hope revival ministries we pray for the gospel channel we want the Lord to continue to pour out his anointing and his direction it's a tremendous responsibility that sits on the shoulders of brother Eric Erickson and there are times when it gets down to what looks like very tight circumstances and we just go to prayer on occasion they will let us know it's time to pray a little more and we jump right in there and we pray and I want you to pray I want to invite you to become a prayer partner for the gospel Channel and if the Lord lays on your heart that there is something more that you can do to keep this beautiful Network on the air you reach out to the gospel channel you reach out to them and partner with them and I believe that it is a very fertile harvest field to give of your finances to I believe that the Lord will bless you I've seen how the family lives the staff lives there I want you to know that what they're doing for the kingdom of God is of a sacrificial nature and we get to be the beneficiaries even I on my computer from time to time I tune in to see what's going on at the gospel channel what a wonderful treat that we can do that wherever we are I can look at it on my phone on my computer at work or my laptop at home and so the Ministry of the gospel channel reaches farther than just the television and I appreciate that you can visit the website and stream let me also mention to you that we have a tremendous amount of free resources available to you if you have been blessed by our ministry and you want to know more or you want to listen to more or view more you can visit us on Facebook you can visit us on YouTube where you can subscribe to our Channel and have access to all of the programs that we do for the gospel channel as well as our services at New Hope revival ministries here in Alabama and we also have an app that we've been telling you about and quite a few of you have taken advantage of both subscribing to the YouTube channel and also downloading the app for your smartphone or your tablet you know we're not trying to build some sort of Kingdom and promote ourselves but I want you to know that we believe in what we believe in we believe that there is an unveiling of the Lord Jesus Christ from his word that the Holy Spirit of God is providing and has been providing eyesalve that we might be able to see the Word of God in a fresh way more clearly than we have ever seen it before I believe that it began with the Apostle John on the Isle of Patmos this apocalypsis this unveiling this revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ and I believe that even one generation ago there was a most significant download of that unveiling that revelation of Jesus Christ and you can find out more about what God did in that ministry on our app if you should so desire to download that app you will be able to hear some amazing preaching and teaching from a servant of the Lord one generation ago brother William Branham and you will also find a living witness at that time of his ministry who had beautiful insight knowing brother Branham on a personal level and having an opportunity to be with him travel with him go hunting with him and also to represent his ministry around the world and we have a lot of the recorded sermons of brother Perry green on our app as well I think that what God did in that great servant of the Lord is so significant even for the hour that we're living in right now that it would be a true blessing in your life to do a little investigating you know I'm that sort of person when I hear that something interesting exciting profound has taken place well I I may not have time to get all the details but I start on the journey and I start digging out and when you do that you're going to find about any particular subject you're going to find the positive and the negative anytime that God uses a servant of the Lord like brother Branham was used there's going to be criticism there's going to be misunderstanding there's going to be those who mock and even those who lie some are jealous of what God was doing and others have just completely misunderstood what the Lord was accomplishing in that ministry and then sometimes those who take up the the call that they recognized on another man of God's life and they they become followers of that ministry well you know people can go overboard and this has certainly been the case in the ministry of brother Branham there have been many of those who loved him but who have really taken their affection for him to the extreme I believe that we must let the Lord Jesus Christ have preeminence in all things but I believe it's very important to recognize the gifts and the offices the messengers that God has sent to those seven church ages and the relevance of their teaching and their preaching and their prophetic ministry and even though we're talking now about one generation ago I find tremendous strength and tremendous help and hope from the preaching that was done spanning the late 40s all the way up to 1965 so we have some of that available if you're scared off by criticisms and websites of criticism then you then you might not you might not be interested in digging in but if you're like me and you have a reason to believe that sometimes when the enemy tries to keep you away from something then there's something that's worth looking into and I'm so thankful for all those many years ago when God let me come in contact with that ministry it has shaped my life and I believe that I am better prepared to meet the Lord in rapture because of that unveiling ministry and let me say to you today that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever he changes not I believe that all revelation is progressive I believe that the Lord has unveiled himself and is continuing to unveil himself one of the things that I remember brother branham saying about this subject that means so much to me is he talked about God being so multifaceted there there is so much in God there is so much of God that we barely understand and one time brother Branham was preaching and he said that our Lord Jesus Christ would still be unveiling and revealing himself for all eternity oh that is a mind-boggling statement but it's one that really gives me hope I want to know more about the Lord did you ever sing that song I want to know more about the Lord and I truly do and I I'm thankful for everything that God has revealed to me and made made personal to me by the Holy Spirit from the word but I'm still learning and to hear a statement like that when when you have learned all you can learn on this earth about the Lord about who he is about how much he's loved his children about how he has watched over us even when we were unaware of his watchful eye and then to think that we step into eternity and even in eternity hallelujah there's so much to know about him that in all eternity he continues to open up himself to reveal himself it's like it's like peeling the layers off of an onion one layer of skin at a time and you peel it off and there's one underneath this is the big God the wonderful glorious omnipotent God that we serve that there is so much in him that we are just scratching the surface but one day we will step out of time into the realm of eternity and for all of that eternity we'll continue to learn of him to sit at his feet to worship Him and to hear those words of life and truth that come out of his mouth I've always been fascinated by that verse of scripture that says that if everything that happened in the life of the Lord Jesus Christ everything that happened in his ministry would have been as carefully recorded as what we have in the four Gospels that the world would not be able to contain the volumes that could have been written about him I'm talking about a very short span of earthly ministry but so profound on so many different levels that the world could not contain the record of what was accomplished in his earthly coming his body coming to the Lord to this earth as the Lord Jesus Christ I tell you that makes me hungry it makes me hungry for more of him to spend more time with him now and in order to do that well we have to make some tough choices sometime and we have to recognize that we allow things to slip in they become important and they become priority and truly as a born-again spirit fill believer our Lord Jesus Yeshua he wants to be our number one reason for getting up in the morning our number one reason for pressing through life and I want to tell you if it were not for the Lord I love my wife I love my children I think I've said that on this broadcast before they mean so much to me I'm so delighted and I enjoy so much spending time with them but if they were the only reason if they were all that I had in this world I don't know if that would be enough I seriously doubt that that would be enough to to inspire me encouraged me to keep pressing through some of the battles of having a public ministry but it's my time with him it's those moments when he whispers to my spirit sometimes he speaks so clearly to us that it is as though we have heard an audible voice and at times he whispers so sweetly so peacefully and yet so profoundly to the inside of the inside sometimes we call it our know where he speaks to our knower something on the inside of us we just know that God has ministered strength to us he has whispered a word of encouragement he has reminded us of a particular passage of Scripture that we can just chew on this that sound too carnal or disrespectful I hope not because the Word of God is our daily bread and really we can meditate on it and ruminate in it and on it and be strengthened by it don't ever neglect God's Word in your life it's much more than a history book it is a written record of the Living Word of God when we were together the last time we were talking about a new season in life encouraging you that may be what you're going through right now is well it feels like you're sort of paralyzed maybe you feel like you're in a holding pattern that you're not really accomplishing very much for the Lord in fact it's sometimes that during those periods of time in our life we feel almost completely disconnected from the Lord but I believe and I want to announce it I want to declare it decree it to prophetically so it into your life I believe that your season is changing and I believe that the only thing that's holding you back is you've got to believe that you've got to accept that God allows these herbs and flows these seasonal changes remember that sometimes we get down in the valley but if it were not for at least two Mountains there wouldn't be a valley and so in the Christian life I think we're safe to say there's always going to be more blessing than trials but sometimes that old enemy he likes to magnify the trial he likes to magnify the heartache and the loss and sort of cloud our vision and affect our ability to remember the goodness of God in our life so I just want as a part of our ministry to you I want to come here as often as God will give us the strength to do it and I want to sow words of encouragement into your life that you who are born again of the Spirit of God you have power and authority in your life and I believe that there's authority in your God inspired words when the Spirit of the Lord breathes on you and you began to speak words of truth even into your own circumstances even to your own situation I I recently read something I'm not going to go into the detail of it it was very short it was just to comment that someone made but when I read it I just simply sensed fear I stood up from my desk and I walked down the hallway coming out of my office here at the New Hope revival ministries and I just began to talk to the Lord out loud my son works in the hallway in another room near where I work and there are other brothers who work in another area of of the church facility and I don't know sometimes they probably hear me talking to myself sometimes they probably hear me talking to the law but my son was going to lunch and there was nobody to hear me and I walked up and down that hallway just today saying over and over again I refused fear I pray Lord for the people of this church community that they will not be moved by fear but when the enemy tries to place fear over their lives because of a threat that the enemy may have have issued against them I pray that the peace of God and the love of God will rise up in every saint to defeat the fear I I continued to declare out loud I refuse to be paralyzed by fear I refuse to allow the enemy to cause me to change my plans my vision my burden my goals because of fear the fear of failure the fear of the unknown the fear of what might happen what could happen the possibilities and I just felt some encouragement nobody praying for me just praying for myself and for my people you're speaking it out over their lives I want to do the same for you I just decree and declare over you right now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that the next time fear moves in to try to paralyze you there in your home that you will remember that you are a blood-bought child of the Living God and if you don't know that you're born again you can fix that right now by inviting the Lord Jesus Christ into your life repenting of your sins and making your peace with him I just want to pray and believe that that in those moments when the enemy tries to overwhelm you with with the what-ifs the possibilities of what might be what could possibly happen that you will reject that and refuse to come into agreement I tell you that the enemy of our soul that old devil he's he's got a wild imagination doesn't he have you ever caught yourself on one of those bunny trails of thought if that should happen and then oh my that could happen and the next thing you know that that would then happen and and this could mean that and the other thing could mean one of the ways the enemy will get ahold of your mind to torment you is a feeling in your body some symptom in your body and then you go to dr. Google and you look up what that symptom means and my the next thing you know you'll be signing a contract at the funeral home making sure you've picked out the right casket this is how the enemy works and really it's to keep us paralyzed in fear so that we're just wasting time time that we need to be using declaring the goodness of the only true Living God Yahweh God our holy God the translation we have in English of his name Jehovah he is the great I am I am that I am the Lord Jesus Christ is that same God in body form the Word made flesh and there's so much that we need to be doing for him prayers that need to be prayed songs that need to be sung lives that need to be witness to testimonies that need to be shared and yet that old enemy he will get us on the bunny trail of thought I'm going to believe for you the same way I've believed for my own church people and when we move from the realm of fear to the realm of faith it not only changes our thoughts but what is a word a word is a thought expressed so if our thoughts change guess what else changes our confession what comes out of our mouth changes because our thoughts have been changed this is one of the most important things that I have to do brother sister I have to do it in my own life every single day I have to watch those thoughts because they will become words and once that comes out of my mouth it not only affects my life my health my destiny but it influences others around me God helped me have mercy on me and I pray the same prayer for you we need to change our thoughts because we need to change our vocabulary we need to be speaking a message of hope and life and truth according to God's Word not paralyzed in fear in our flat afraid to face life afraid to face today much less tomorrow when we know by the scripture perfect love casteth out fear and so again let me say to you there is a new season available for you if you can only believe if you can only allow your faith to reach up and say yes Lord yes Lord I take that new season and and I'm going to do everything within my power to live it as a new season ultimately we know it's up to the Spirit of God the Spirit of Truth to help change circumstances around us but all there is power in our confession there is Authority in our what comes out of our mouth what we confess remember friend the New Testament tells us that he is the high priest are you listening to me he is the high priest of our confession oh so we want to be careful right because what does a high priest do he takes the offering and he raises it up as an offering to God whatever was brought whatever the people provided he took that offering that sacrifice that blood and raised it up to God if the New Testament tells us that our Lord Jesus Christ is a high priest of our confession I'm so thankful that we have a high priest who is touched by the feeling of our infirmities and he lives he ever lives to make intercession to God for us thank you Lord that you are that great high priest and the high priest of my confession so I need to be careful what I'm what I'm offering to the high priest of my confession so I got to be careful what my confession is because my confession is then carried before the Eternal Spirit of the Father by my great high priest so there are so many reasons why we have to watch our thoughts and we have to watch our words we have to respond not in fear but in faith Lord I I received my new season and when the Lord continued to deal with us in our little church about this thought he began to speak to my spirit and he said I'm giving you a new season and you're going to need a new anointing for that new season oh I like that because I know there is power in the anointing and I want us to talk about that today in the in the Bible there's a beautiful passage of scripture in Isaiah chapter 10 it is in verse 27 Isaiah 10:27 and it shall come to pass in that day that his burdens shall be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing we've ministered that verse here on the gospel channel before it's such a powerful verse because the enemy he likes to place that yoke of burden of bondage on our shoulder maybe you can picture in your mind that yoke from from times past that would be laid on the on the shoulder of the oxen driving the cart or plowing the field the ox goad it's called sometime heavy piece of lumber of timber that would lay on the shoulder of that old ox and it gave the operator the farmer it gave him greater control over moving and stopping and changing the direction of that ox now if the enemy has a yoke on your shoulder what does that mean it means that the enemy has greater ability to cause you to move to stop to turn to the left to turn to the right at his will at his whim I don't know about you but I have a feeling that you're like me in the sense that you don't want the enemy to have that much control of your life I say no control I don't want to do the devil's bidding he's going to have to find another ox he's going to have to find another servant there is a way hallelujah that that yoke on your shoulder can be destroyed the scripture is clear and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oh praise God wonderful Lord I thank you for that anointing we can have a new fresh anointing for a new season that God is calling us into I want you to know that the anointing is not a feeling it's not an idea it's not an emotion it's not an atmosphere it's not the hair standing up on your arms the anointing is a person the anointing is a presence the presence of a person the person of the Lord Jesus Christ when when the Spirit of God promises I want to give you a fresh anointing for the new season what does it mean I believe it means that God wants you and I to experience the presence the person of Jesus Christ in a fresh way in a new way I believe that it is possible to have a fresh experience with Jesus Christ every day of our lives and that is my goal that is my desire I cannot say that I have experienced that every day of my life but it's possible I believe it's available and I believe the only thing standing in my way is me I believed it takes what we were speaking about just a few moments ago it takes a change of thought it takes a change of vocabulary it takes a rearranging of our priorities I want you to know that when we begin to understand who this is living on the inside of us I mean truly understand what it means to have the life the spirit life of Jesus Christ living on the inside of me living on the inside of you by the new birth then it becomes easier perhaps even quicker to connect with God when we are fully persuaded that we are not trying to get a hold of a God that lives a million miles away we are merely communicating reaching in to a God that has chosen hallelujah a God who has chosen to live inside of us by the power of the Holy Ghost and when we're reaching for him we're not reaching past the Milky Way we're not trying to get our prayers around Jupiter and Saturn and Mars so that we can find our our way into heaven we're reaching to a God who has chosen what house will you build me the scripture said God was temporarily pleased to dwell in a tabernacle made of badger skin the skin of goats God was temporarily pleased to dwell in a house made of Cedars one that was destroyed and then restored and rebuilt again the Holy Temple of God but God his original design his original purpose we know this from Genesis from the beginning from the book of origin his original design and desire was to have a people a person a family of sons a family of persons that he could come and live inside my eyes become the eyes of the Lord he desires to look through my eyes my hands become the hands of the Lord by feet become the feet of the Lord my body becomes the temple of the Holy Ghost and I'm waiting and watching and sensing what would you have me to do I I have to admit that there are times in my life that I feel like I've become slower about knowing the mind of God and the heart of God but I'm determined to keep pressing in when I was a young minister I I had oh my I don't know what kind of faith you'd call it it it was called in the great healing revivals bulldog faith faith was my first response when there was a tragedy faith was my first response when there was a problem faith was what came into my heart into my mind and out of my mouth before I had an opportunity to react emotionally I reacted in faith and I want you to know I want to go back to that place I'm I am going back to that place I'm on a journey back to that place you you may not appreciate what an inspiration that can be to other people that in the midst of a tragedy faith comes out of your heart and faith comes out of your mouth it inspires other people to look to Jesus instead of looking to the hardship to the sickness the infirmity the circumstances if we get our eyes friend if we get our eyes on the circumstances we'll go to bed we will and we won't want to get out of bed we'll be like you know somebody pulling the covers up over their face and trying to hide from life but my goodness we can't do that we can't hide from life neither can we let life pass us by because we only have one life to live here in this dimension of time one day we will lay this dimension of time down and the body that we have chosen to live in that God has placed us in and we will step into a place a dimension where there is no time only eternity but we're living in time now and I hate to be so plain but the clock is ticking your time is ticking away it doesn't matter whether you're a teenager or a senior citizen we're not promised of tomorrow if we should all live a long healthy life it's still coming quicker than what we would like for it to come so can I afford to spend days of my life hiding from life no sir I can't i myself have made a commitment to get back to that place where faith is my first reaction and my first response in fact I'm claiming that as part of the new anointing in this new season that God will so help my mind that it becomes very automatic when I am presented with a need with a problem with the tragedy I want the Lord to so touch my thoughts that the first thing I think of is God has got a plan he has a plan and he is working all things out for the good of them who loved the Lord of them who are the called according to his purpose I believe that you're watching this program and many of you are a part of the called according to his purpose but you've been living life really from from the covers from underneath the covers some of you have been letting life pass while you have been taking a little nap in the closet so to speak it's time for you to come out of the cave it's time for you to arise and shine it's time for you and I to agree today that the anointing of the Lord a new and fresh experience with Jesus Christ on a personal level can destroy the yoke that the enemy has placed on your shoulder because of the anointing the yoke shall be destroyed I love that word destroyed I love this expression it's not just broken I think I've shared this on the program already but I'm just trying to follow the leadership of the Lord today it's not just broken because I think most of you know that old enemy is very determined he doesn't give up that quick and if we should just pray a prayer to break the yoke you know he would just get out superglue he would do anything and everything he could to patch that thing up make it a little heavier and slap it right back on your back to control you like a farmer would control the oxcart but because of the anointing the yoke that the enemy has used will not only be broken says the Lord through the prophet Isaiah but it shall be what would you say it destroyed utterly destroyed so that it is irreparable irreparable it cannot be repaired that's the goodness of God and that is what he wants you and I to be able to experience with him and in him well if we don't know that it's available then we don't know what to ask for what to believe for so that's one of my jobs that's one of my responsibilities it's one that I take very serious I want to be here I want to be faithful I want to be helping to share with you little keys small pieces of inspiration that you'll be able to grab ahold of and say hey I'll try that in my own life and I won't try it expecting that it won't work or that it won't make a difference but I will apply that believing that because it is based in truth and in faith that it will work in in Psalm 92 and verse 10 there is an unusual verse of scripture it says but my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of a unicorn I shall be anointed with fresh oil in the amplified version of Psalm 92 10 it reads this way but my horn and in parentheses emblem of excessive strength and stately grace you have exalted like that of a wild ox I am anointed with fresh oil there's no such thing as a unicorn Bible Translators have all they have argued for years about whether or not that is a rhinoceros or whether that is some kind of cape buffalo with horns with a large horn maybe some kind of of antelope with one one horn but it doesn't really matter what species was used here because it was a symbol of power and authority and the psalmist is saying you have exalted my strength my authority and my grace and I shall be anointed with fresh oil no one is hearing you and if they are who cares why don't you make this confession with me right now I am anointed with fresh oil let's say that again I am anointed with fresh oil here's a verse of scripture that I can take a hold of you've promised Lord a fresh anointing for the new season I'm learning that the anointing is a person Immanuel God with us the Messiah the Christ the Anointed One and I want a fresh encounter with you Lord with him the anointing is a knowing it is an assurance that comes by revelation when God opens up his word to you and it drops from your head to your heart it gets down in the inside of the inside and becomes a part of who you are I was listening to someone speaking today for just a few minutes while I was eating my lunch on YouTube and one of the things that was said was very very similar to that knowing and that revelation and this person said once God reveals something to you it becomes a part of you well I made that same statement yesterday in our church in Smith Station Alabama or our on Saturday night in one of our services I believe that I believe that's why revelation is so important the more we allow the Spirit of God to give us understanding of revelation of and we have to present ourselves for revelation we have to make ourselves available for revelation we can't run here and there chasing this and that and expect God to reveal his word to us we have to position ourselves in prayer we have to position ourselves to look at God's Word prayerfully to read it prayerfully and pray that God will speak we need to be led to ministries that we can have confidence in that's what I was sharing with you at the opening of this program today God connected me sovereignly to a ministry and when by the time I found out more I realized that the man that God had used so mightily had died three years before I was ever born and yet I've learned more from listening to that man preach and teach and minister in the supernatural than I could have perhaps learned from a mentor that I was sitting around the coffee hour with every day God allowed and arranged that for me I have confidence in how God used him and how his words tied connected dovetailed with the scripture you and not need that we need that in our life somebody that we can listen to learn from glean from help point us in the right direction I know that ultimately you and I have to have our own relationship with Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit but when we're hungry for revelation when we're praying for an encounter with the spirit of understanding it's good to know that we have a source we have someone that we can listen to and feed from and if it's someone that's alive that you can visit with but if not I believe that God has been good to preserve resources and materials for us that we can feed on and feast on the ultimate purpose of doing that is to have not more knowledge in the in the sense of of information but knowledge in the sense of intimacy the Bible speaking about Mary the Virgin girl the mother of our Lord so to speak the one who carried him in her womb she knew no man that didn't mean that she didn't know any men she knew a family member she had perhaps brothers and a father and there were neighbors and she knew people men and women but that is a knowing by introduction or by association but when the scripture said she knew no man it means she was not intimate she had not had sexual relations with a man that kind of knowing is that deeper knowing that's the kind of knowing that you and I desire from the word not just to be introduced to it and fellowship it on surface level but I want to go deep I want that word to go deep in me because I believe that the revealed Word of God changes us I believe we're change one molecule one cell at a time I do I believe there's nothing like sitting under the anointed Word of God and the more of that word that is revealed to us the more that we can fellowship with that word on an intimate level the more we are changed from the inside out and the more of that word that becomes a part of us and I'm telling you something you know you can try to defeat the enemy with hearsay and that might work for you part of the time but there's something better than hearsay there there's some truth that has been made known to me that it didn't just I didn't just hear it from the preacher and say that's it that's right the Spirit of God quickened that word truth to me the Spirit of God made that revelation alive in my heart then that becomes a part of me and so that then becomes part of my weapon part of my arsenal against the enemy we need that revelation that unveiling of the word and that comes to us every time we encounter the genuine anointing of the Holy Spirit he quickens more and more of the word of the truth to us do you remember the verse of scriptures well several verses of Scripture that we used in our series on in the fullness of time that was found in Galatians 4 let me read only one verse of that to you reminding you of it Galatians 4:6 and because you are sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father oh my we covered that in that series on the fullness of time this spirit of his son the Holy Spirit Jesus said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you in another place he said I will pray the father and he will send you another comforter that other comforter was a different dimension of that same spirit that was in the Lord Jesus Christ it was now going to be taken and divided among believers initially 120 gathered in the upper room on the a Pentecost but look how many have encountered the power of the Holy Spirit all the way up till now 2019 where we're living now many many many many many have had personal encounters with the power of the Holy Spirit I'm here to tell you I have had a personal relationship and encounter with that Holy Spirit of God the Holy Ghost of God and because the spirit of his son that's the same spirit because it was sent into my heart it brings me into relationship son ship it looses in my life and covers me with the spirit of adoption and it's by that spirit of adoption that I can cry out to the father the same father that our Lord led us in prayer our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name but when the spirit of his son is sent into your heart you can know him in a more intimate level than our Father hallowed be thy name you can know him as the scripture says here Abba Father Abba Father this is an intimate knowing of God to really know him and be known of him it's like saying Papa oh my papa my Abba oh how you love me and because you love me I'm able to love you and I want to love you more I believe that that could possibly also be your prayer to know him more to love him more and I believe this is a good season for you to experience that kind of love that knowing that assurance father I thank you for your presence today I thank you for the gift of the Holy Ghost and how all he has come into my life and has given me such joy and strength I desire for all of my friends to have that same experience with you and so I pray Lord that as they look to you in faith and as they agree with me in prayer that you will fill them that that you will fill them that they will come to a place of obeying your word and be filled with the Holy Ghost I pray Lord that that life your life in them would give them the strength to embrace this new season because of the anointing we decree and declare that the yoke of bondage that the enemy has placed on their neck their shoulder it must be broken it shall be broken we declare it we prophesy it we press into that truth for every one who has faith to believe right now whether it's healing or whether it's family problem or whether it's finances or a warfare whatever they are facing today I pray that the enemy will no longer be successful in using that yoke to control them to direct them to drive them I pray that even now the anointing of the Holy Spirit will break and destroy that yoke so that it can never be repaired and used against them may they grow in grace and may they find a ministry that they can connect to that will help point them in the direction of Revelation and may the spirit of understanding come and make your word live in the hearts of men and women we ask this in faith believing in the wonderful name of Yeshua in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen man I've enjoyed being with you today tune in again next time god bless you bye-bye [Music] [Applause] [Music]
