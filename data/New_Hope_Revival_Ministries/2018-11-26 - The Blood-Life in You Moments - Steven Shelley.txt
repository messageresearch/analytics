TRANSCRIPT
========================================
who wants the lamb he wants the Word made flesh but it's not his body that saves us today can I say the next it's not his mind that saves us today it's the life it's the life that was in the blood the chemistry of the blood is gone but the life of the blood is mine I said it's mine and now by the scripture I am the blood of Christ how by the spirit by the Spirit the life that was alive didn't follow me the life of God fell on me what does that make me if the life of God falls on me brother Bentham said it makes me eternal somebody said what nor do you mean I'm going to a land where the soul of man shall never die
