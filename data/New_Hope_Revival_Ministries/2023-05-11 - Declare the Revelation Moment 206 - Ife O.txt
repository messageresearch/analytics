Description:
What is the Message?  The Message is Christ unveiling Himself in all that He is.  It’s the Apokalupsis of Christ, the fullness of the Word spoken by the mouth of all God’s holy prophets since the world began.  It is all the Truth of all the other Messages pulled together.

Now the Bride is called to ministry, to display His character,  to prophesy and declare the Revelation of Jesus Christ.  Now is the appointed time for the Bride to shine.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we're in that place where the bride is called to Ministry what is the message the message is Christ himself that's what it is somebody said what is the message it is the unveiling of Christ himself because if Christ is unveiled you see him in all that he is not just lover not just passionate friend but judge of all mankind a lot of people don't want to know a god like that they feel like if we don't try to know a god like that we won't face the Judgment but we but they will they will the message is Christ himself it's the unveiling it's the apocalipsis of Christ the fullness of the word spoken by the mouth of all God's holy prophets since the world began and so the Bible said it's it's all the truth it took the restoration through the church ages to bring us to that point of culmination and that's why we hear Brother Branham saying that seventh angel he has no message of his own he's just tying together all of the Loose Ends loose threads of all the other messages why was that necessary because Luther although he preached justification was still a trinitarian baptizing in titles more Catholic than some Catholics today Wesley though he though he had the sanctification right was still a trinitarian baptizing in the name of titles and at the end of his life allowed them sprinkling so we that wasn't all the truth so we had to have somebody to come and say though these Messengers from Paul all the way through to Wesley they restored great truth there had to be somebody who could come at the end of the age and tie together pulling together pulling out the truth and leaving behind that which was not truth because from Ephesus which was a perfect word it began to go down see and it had to come back up we're in that place where the bride is called to Ministry we're in that place where the bride is called to prophesy we're not depending on the seventh angel to prophesy anymore it's now the bride's time it's now time for the bride to prophesy it's time for the bride to declare the revelation of Jesus Christ it's time for the bride to reflect the character of the Lord Jesus Christ it's our time now that's what the message said that's what the word has said we've got a problem and we either want to put everything in the past or we want to put everything way out there in the future so we can live how we want to live now but now is the important time now is the appointed time
