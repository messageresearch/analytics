Description:
In the Old Testament G-d was very specific on how He wanted His dwelling place built and gave detailed instructions on how everything was to be structured. We believe that He no longer dwells in tents and temples but His desire is to inhabit a people, the Bride of Christ, and that she follow His divine pattern for how He wants His “temple” built today!

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] praise the Lord I'm Pastor step Shelly and I'm coming to you from the New Hope Revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama I want to thank the Lord for the blessing and the privilege that he's given us today to be able to come to you in your home uh in your place of business or wherever you may be even on the internet and preach to you the uncompromised gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ It's a Wonderful privilege that we have to be able to speak openly and freely about the wonderful things of God I want you to know that we don't need to take it for granted we need to thank the Lord for these Divine Christian broadcast networks that are dedicated to getting the whole gospel out to the nations of the world and so I want to thank the Lord today for the privilege that he's given us to be on such fine gospel networks I want us to look to the word of God today and begin a study I I don't know what I'm going to call it yet we'll just get into it and see what the Lord has but I want to invite you first to visit our Ministry website at revival. g revival. g you can send in your prayer request and it would be our honor and privilege to help you pray we believe that there's power in prayer and it would be an honor to join with you in faith and believe God to meet your needs so let's get ready now and go right to the word of God Amen I'm going to begin reading today in Exodus chapter 25 verse 8 and9 we're going to be speaking about uh God's pattern God's pattern and what it means to measure up to God's pattern we're living in an hour today where uh it it reminds me so much of what we read about in The Book of kings and in The Chronicles of the older Covenant where it talks about every man doing that which is right in his own eyes the only time that the scripture mentions people doing what's right in their own eyes it's always a time of Calamity it's always a time uh of great trouble and of great distress and in the hour that we're living in all over this wonderful world that God has made we are finding out that people are ignoring God's pattern uh so many people seem to have no regard for God 's desires and what it means to please the Lord he's our creator and he's been so good to us and it's the least that we can do like the Apostle Paul said that we should present our bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is our reasonable service I want us to look at some of the scriptures that remind us that God is a particular God you might call him a picky God someone who is very sure about what he desires what he wants how he wants things to be the older Covenant gives us such a beautiful picture of of God's detail oriented mindset I like to call him a meticulous God uh he cared about everything to the smallest detail in the construction of the Tabernacle in the construction of the temple and the furnishings and the veils and all of the of the other implements that were to be used in the Tabernacle and I think it sends us a message today that God cares about us he cares about even the meticulous details of Our Lives he cares what we're going through what we're facing in life the burden s we carry the pain we feel the grief that we endure the New Testament talks about the fact that not one Little Sparrow that's a smallest little bird falls to the ground uh except that the father knows about it he doesn't miss even the smallest little sparrow that that loses his perch and falls to the ground he is careful to clothe the lies to make sure that the lies come up in the right season and unfurl their beauty the beauty that is a reflection of our Creator God cares about those things uh he says that we should cast our cares on him that's not just our heavy burdens but it's every care every burden everything that that troubles us or concerns us God cares about that it also says to us us that God is concerned about how we live our lives he doesn't want us uh groping around in the darkness trying to find our way wondering guessing what it takes to please God and that's why he gave us this word as an absolute it is a beautiful record of the word of God and in the pages of this beautiful love story we find God's requirements we find a description of what it takes to please God and to show him how much we love him you know it's just not about words it's about action it's about it's about our deed it's about a life of surrender I don't want you to misunderstand in this teaching or in the teachings that we're going to be do going to be doing in the next few weeks I don't want you to misunderstand as though I'm trying to to teach you that we are saved by our Behavior or by our works I understand from the scriptural record that we are not saved by works we are saved by grace by faith in the finished work of our sacrificial lamb the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah but we are saved unto Works in other words we are not saved by works but when we are saved d by the grace of God he gives us the grace he gives us the power to do the works of righteousness to live a life that pleases him I remember uh reading one time in a in a book called Glory written by a missionary whose name was Ruth Ward hefin she talked about uh when a young woman is uh uh looking for a Suitor or a young man is looking for a young lady to court and she said if you get young ladies talking H they notice every detail about this handsome young man the way he stands the way he smells the way he walks because they're watching him very carefully you know and uh Ruth said in her book well then that young lady will start to try to discover what he likes uh so that she can uh capture his attention somehow maybe she finds out that he likes Limon pie so she's going to bake him a lemon pie in other words wouldn't it be awful to to spend your whole life baking lemon pies for God our Father and find out when we get to heaven that he couldn't stand lemon pies he was actually partial to Strawberry you could have easily made a strawberry pie if you would have known that that's what his heart really desired and so Ruth was saying when you're trying to uh capture a young man's attention you do it by discovering the things that he likes and pleasing him it's a love affair and I think a young man who cares about a young woman would go about it the same way he would find out what kind of music she liked what her favorite color was what kind of hobbies she had because if you want to capture someone's heart there's a way to go about it and that is to do the things that that please the things that are Pleasant the things that are lovely to that person who you are showing interest in and that's how it is in our love affair with the Lord Jesus Christ we want to find out we want to discover the things that he loves why because I want to love what he loves I want to understand the things that he hates why because I want to hate the things that he hates I want to please him in every way Beloved the Lord is seeking out a bride not just a church he's looking for an elected lady he's looking for a company of Overcomers who will lean their head on the on the chest of the Beloved so close close to his heart that we might even discover the heartbeat of our Messiah of our Heavenly lover so that we can know everything there is to know about what he's thinking and what he's Desiring for the coming days upon the Earth we are headed into very very perilous times I want you to understand that the world as we have known it a generation ago we'll never see that again again until greater days Millennial days at the end of the great Wrath of the Great Tribulation we're we're headed into very very Troublesome times governments are shaking the Earth is quaking there are signs and wonders the threat of nuclear war the the the threat of global terrorism we could go on and on stock markets crashing uh Financial uh Market markets are are bottoming out currency is being devalued listen folk the world is in trouble the only hope that people have is in a saving relationship in a trusting relationship with our faithful Creator God and I I just really believe that a call is going forth in this hour to rise above the status quo rise above average Church ity and truly discover what pleases the Lord so that we can live that sort of a life so that we can please him in all things let's take a look at the scriptural record and let's let's just establish in our minds in our Spirits the fact that God knows what he wants you know I'm just happy that we serve a God who is not what we might say wishy-washy we serve a God who is uh steady who is predictable because he gives us a record uh a track record we could say in his word we know that there's not a situation too big for him to uh undertake in there's not a sickness too grave for the great physician to step in and heal there's not a person so wicked so far away away from righteousness that his hand cannot reach down to save and to deliver we just serve a great big capable God and it's vitally important in this hour that we come into a place of intimate fellowship with him and love him like we've never loved him before and begin to discover uh what it means to become his wife in the end time what it means to be joined with messiah in holy Union so that the final works of God on planet Earth a great cooperation between the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride that that great uh uh consummation of the ages can come together and we can uh play out the final chapter of this drama so that we can move move into our Eternal place of safety uh in his arms I don't know about you but I'm looking forward to Eternity but I'm I'm going to be honest with you I'm getting a little bit excited about today and tomorrow because there's such a great opportunity in front of us to be able to become one with him and to demonstrate his character to demonstrate his attri rutes on planet earth once again like we read about in the acts of the Holy Spirit through the apostles that great chapter great book of the Bible after the four gospels uh most people call it Acts of the Apostles but we know that it's not what the apostles did but it's about what the Holy Spirit did through the apostles how many of you listening or watching this broadcast right now desire to be one of of those yielded vessels one of those uh Endtime Apostles that God could flow through you and demonstrate his power through you like he did through Peter and through Paul and through James and through John of old remember that the scripture tells us Jesus Christ Hebrews 13 and8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever he changes not Exodus 25 verse 8 and9 says and let them make me a sanctuary God was looking for a sanctuary to dwell in he was already dwelling in the sanctuary of the heavenlies but he desired to come down and dwell in a sanctuary so that he might relate to mankind that I may dwell among them the second part of verse 8 tells us and then in verse n according to all that I will show thee this must have been a relief for Moses that he wouldn't have to figure it out on his own that he wouldn't have to try to guess and hit and miss to figure out what it was that God wanted in this Sanctuary that he wanted to come and dwell in God said to Moses I'm going to show you the pattern he goes on to say according to all that I show thee after the pattern of the Tabernacle in Hebrew the word Tabernacle is mishon and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall ye make it and so Not only was the tabernacle pattern the pattern for the actual Sanctuary going to be given but every piece of furniture every instrument that was going to be used in the mishon in the sanctuary was also going to be revealed to Moses by pattern so that it could be created in the earth exactly like it was shown to Moses in the heavenlies I think if we're going to discover God's pattern for mankind we're going to have to get in the spirit to do it we're going to have to like Moses to be caught up in the realm of the spirit when we stay in the realm of the Flesh in the realm of the Soul it's so depressing we're we're we're reading all the bad news and our spirit is getting drugged down we need to soar like an eagle we need to draw close to the Lord in prayer and In Praise so that we can find ourselves as John did in Revelation chap one I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day John said you and I need to pray or praise until we can get in the spirit because it's only in the spirit that we begin to discover the pattern that God has determined and purposed for our lives for our Destinies here on planet Earth now let's just talk about for just a moment why God had this need why he needed or desired to to have a tabernacle uh up until this point the heavens were his Sanctuary even the Earth was his Tabernacle but now he wanted to come down and to sort of confine himself in in one uh aspect we could say he wanted to come down and dwell in a in a Tabernacle in a in a tent uh I'd like to say for a concentrated purpose for a for a manifested purpose now now when we're talking about the spirit of the lord we understand that God is omnipresent his spirit is everywhere at the same time that's how we can have a good Holy Ghost service in Smith Station Alabama and you can have a good Holy Ghost service in India or in Norway or in England or Iceland or wherever you might be watching this broadcast because the spirit of God is omnipresent it means he can be everywhere at one time time however there is a manifested presence of God that we read about in the older Covenant where God comes down in a manifest way and appeared for instance when he appeared to Moses on the mountain and he came down and pronounced his name before Moses when Moses was given the second uh set of tablets and was called up in the mountain to meet the Lord so there is a concentration of his presence in this tent of meeting this Tabernacle this Sanctuary so let's look at the four reasons why why we uh find out why we discover that God wanted to to find himself or to to bring himself into a tabernacle number one so that God might dwell among his people this was the desire of God he didn't want to just be an abstract Spirit floating over every one's head like a balloon or a cloud he wanted to come down and dwell with men why because even the great Creator the Living God of Eternity he desires Fellowship this this I don't know if this is a good expression or not but it it short circuits my brain sometime when I when I think about the fact that the god of Eternity so loves me so loves you that he desires to come down and dwell not only with us but in this period of the newer Covenant he wants to dwell in Us by the power of the Holy Spirit of the Holy Ghost and so this was uh similar to what God desired in the Garden of Eden when he came down and had fellowship with Adam and Eve but now he has two million people that he wants to have Fellowship with and so he decides to come down and with his with his manifest presence his Shak presence into a tent a tent of meeting a tabernacle so that he might dwell among his people number two he wanted to teach his people about his Holiness now I tell you this is a huge lesson that we want to learn that we need to learn and and much of the Holiness of God is revealed in the scripture he is so holy God Is So holy that our human Minds can hardly grasp uh understand or even begin to scratch the surface of what it means to serve a holy God and he wanted to reveal his Holly to his people he wanted his people to begin to understand his Holiness so that we could approach him not in fear but in reverence in respect and by the way all fear is not wrong Isaiah 111 and2 talks about the seven spirits of God and one of those Spirits is the spirit of of of fear it's reverential fear fear God wants us walking in a reverential fear a fear uh that is not a fear of if we make the wrong step he's going to disintegrate us rather it's a fear that brings concern to our Inner Man lest we do anything that would displease him because we love him so much we want to honor him and we want to please him you may be listening to this broadcast right now and you may think you love the Lord more than anything else in all the world but I want to tell you the bride of Christ is going to be called in this hour to a place of love into a relationship a love affair with the Lord that's going to determine every step that we make it's going to begin to dictate every choice that we make in life every direction that we turn in we're going to walk before for him in such love such perfect love such reverential fear that we won't do anything unless we know that it is the will of our father we have this example in our Messiah Jesus told them I don't do anything unless it's shown to me of my father what a perfect and beautiful example he was before us he was the spirit of God tabernacled in human flesh and yet he wouldn't do anything in this earth unless it was shown to him given to him of the father what if I told you that there's going to be a remnant of people an overcoming bride in the last days that will walk before the Lord in that same place of surrender in that same place of reverential fear that we will do nothing unless it's shown to us of the father are we there yet no but I want you to know we're closer to being there than we were yesterday God's economy is rolling on you may look around you and think that things are at a standstill but I want you to know beneath the surface of this old flesh there's an inner work that's going on thanks be to God there's an inner work that's going on and the spirit of God is bringing a cleansing he's bringing a correction he's causing even iron to sharpen iron there are even conflicts that go on sometime in our Earthly relationships that drive us to our knees sometimes it's on our knees in Repentance sometimes it's on our knees asking the Lord for more understanding but who cares what it's about as long as it drives us to our knees because it's on our knees it's in a place of humility before the Lord that the will of God can be revealed to us and it's also in that place where he begins to pinpoint and point out the areas of our life where we need more of the blood to be applied and more grace to come and cover every situation uh that that's going on in our present lives right now you're watching this broadcast and you're in trouble you're troubled in mind and troubled in spirit I want to ask that the Lord Jesus will come right now and give you perfect peace we're going to pray together we're going to ask the Lord to minister to your need right now father I thank you for those who are watching this broadcast today Lord I don't know who they are I don't know them by name I don't know their address I don't even know the country that they're watching in but you knew them and you knew them before the foundation of the world and I'm asking you Lord to minister to their need they're they're troubled they're walking in a situation that's bringing stress and pain to their lives I ask you to release perfect peace in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ I declare and decree peace to you right now I also pray Lord that you will draw us in this hour to our knees that you will pull us to a place of reverential fear and full surrender to your Divine and perfect plan for Our Lives we want to discover your pattern and we want to be measured by your pattern and where we where we are lacking we pray that you will help us to to grow up to that stature uh of the perfect man the Lord Jesus Christ father release healing I pray and we'll give you honor and Glory bash Adonai Yeshua hamashiach in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen thank you so much much for watching the
