[0:38] Praise the Lord. I'm Pastor Steven
[0:40] Shelley and this is the Eagles Cry. I
[0:43] want to welcome you to the broadcast
[0:45] today and tell you again that I consider
[0:48] it a privilege to come your way, preach
[0:51] the glorious gospel of the Lord Jesus
[0:54] Christ. I hope you can learn something
[0:56] along the way. I'm still learning. God's
[0:59] still revealing himself and his word to
[1:01] me. And that's what keeps me pressing
[1:04] onward because I know that God continues
[1:07] to reveal and unveil himself to his
[1:10] hungry children. Don't ever get to the
[1:13] place where you're so satisfied that you
[1:16] don't hunger for more of God. In fact,
[1:18] for me, it seems like the more I have,
[1:21] the more I receive, the more I want. And
[1:23] that's exactly how it needs to be. God
[1:26] wants to enter into a personal
[1:29] relationship with you. The God I'm
[1:32] talking about is not a God of wood or
[1:35] stone, not an idol, not a statue, but a
[1:38] living God, a living reality. What we
[1:42] have here is a written record of a
[1:45] living God. And when we desire to have a
[1:49] real close relationship with him, he is
[1:53] available. He wants to reveal himself
[1:56] and make himself known to you in in a
[2:00] real way so that when your faith gets
[2:03] tested, you've got something to hang on
[2:06] to. You can say, "Wait a minute. I know
[2:08] I have found the living God, the only
[2:11] real God. Maybe you've heard someone
[2:13] say, "There are many ways to God." I
[2:15] want you to know that is inaccurate.
[2:18] That is not the truth. There's only one
[2:21] way. Jesus said, "I am the way, the
[2:24] truth, and the life." And if you find
[2:27] God, my friend, it'll be through Jesus
[2:31] Christ. That is the way that we can come
[2:34] to God and know him in fullness. That
[2:36] was the love gift that God gave us. He
[2:39] came in a fleshly body, walked among
[2:42] men, healed the sick, raised the dead,
[2:44] cast out devils, and then went to the
[2:47] cross and shed his life's blood so that
[2:51] you and I could be redeemed from the
[2:53] curse of sin and and death. Thank God
[2:56] for that. And rose from the dead on the
[2:59] third day and lives forever more to make
[3:02] intercession to the father on your
[3:04] behalf. Whatever your needs are, they
[3:07] have not escaped the Lord. He knows
[3:10] those needs and he desires to give you
[3:14] what you have need of. You come to him
[3:16] in prayer and in faith. If you want us
[3:18] at New Hope Revival Ministries to uh
[3:21] join with you in prayer over your prayer
[3:24] requests, feel free to pass them on by
[3:26] email or even by letter. We would be
[3:29] more than happy to pray with you,
[3:32] believe God for you. And then when the
[3:34] answer comes, I'll be the first to want
[3:36] to rejoice with you, and give God
[3:38] praise. He is truly, truly worthy. We're
[3:42] beginning a new series today. I want to
[3:45] talk to you about faith. But not just
[3:49] faith. I want to contrast something. I
[3:52] want to explain to you through the word
[3:54] of God that it is possible to have faith
[3:59] and it be only
[4:01] intellectual knowledgebased faith. But
[4:05] what we are really after in this in this
[4:08] hour is a faith that is not just
[4:11] intellectual but it has been transformed
[4:15] into something else from mental faith to
[4:19] supernatural faith which comes by a
[4:22] revelation of the spirit. And so, uh,
[4:25] there are many people who have faith,
[4:28] but I want to be able to know that I
[4:30] possess a faith that was revealed to me
[4:33] by the Holy Spirit so that when the
[4:35] enemy comes to test that faith, and
[4:37] don't you worry, he will. He'll come
[4:39] around and try to test you on what you
[4:42] really believe and whether or not you
[4:45] can hold on to God when the doctor says
[4:47] your days are numbered. whether or not
[4:50] you can hold on to God when your own
[4:52] child is afflicted. When you've got
[4:55] terrible tragedy and calamity happen
[4:58] happening around you in your nation,
[5:00] will you really be able to hold on to
[5:02] God? I believe there are things coming
[5:04] upon this world that will be of such uh
[5:08] a horrendous nature that it will take
[5:11] more than just a knowledgebased faith.
[5:14] It will take a supernatural revelation
[5:17] of faith that connects you to a
[5:20] supernatural and living God to be able
[5:22] to stand against the ws of the enemy
[5:26] right here in the end time. So, what
[5:28] we're going to believe God for is to
[5:30] show us in his word how to move from
[5:34] fact faith, intellectual knowledgebased
[5:38] faith to faith that comes by revelation.
[5:43] In order to do that, we're going to look
[5:45] first to the book of Matthew, the first
[5:48] gospel, Matthew chap 26. And we're going
[5:52] to begin reading today in verse 30. I'd
[5:54] like to read five verses. And beginning
[5:57] in verse 30, and when they had sung him,
[6:01] they went out into the Mount of Olives.
[6:04] Verse 31. Then saith Jesus unto them,
[6:08] All ye shall be offended of me this
[6:11] night, or because of me this night. For
[6:15] it is written, I will smite the
[6:18] shepherd, and the sheep of the flock
[6:21] shall be scattered abroad. But after I
[6:24] am risen again, I go before you into
[6:28] Galilee. Don't miss that. This was Jesus
[6:32] revealing his resurrection promise.
[6:34] Verse 33. Peter answered and said unto
[6:38] him, "Though all men shall be offended
[6:42] because of thee, yet will I never be
[6:46] offended." Oh Peter, be careful what you
[6:49] say. Verse 34, Jesus said unto him,
[6:53] verily I say unto thee, that this night
[6:58] before the cockcrow, thou shalt deny me
[7:02] thrice. That means three times Peter
[7:05] said unto him. Peter will never learn.
[7:08] It seems though I should die with thee,
[7:12] yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also
[7:16] said all the disciples. It wasn't just
[7:19] Peter who decided he would never deny
[7:22] the Lord. All of the disciples said the
[7:25] same thing. We'll never deny you. But
[7:27] Peter said, I'll never even be offended
[7:30] because of you. Well, Jesus just said
[7:32] all men are going to be offended. All
[7:34] men are going to go. But Peter somehow
[7:37] excluded himself from the words of the
[7:39] Lord Jesus Christ. May I submit to you,
[7:42] it's never a good idea to exclude
[7:45] yourself from what Jesus says about you.
[7:47] You need to in fact agree with what the
[7:49] Lord says. He knows best, doesn't he?
[7:52] You see, Peter answered this way and he
[7:55] responded this way because he could not
[7:59] bring himself to believe that he could
[8:02] possibly be one who would deny the Lord.
[8:06] Peter saw his own strength, his own
[8:09] resolve, his own will. And in that will,
[8:14] he said, "I could never deny the Lord."
[8:18] Unfortunately, he had the right
[8:20] confession of his belief, of his faith,
[8:23] but he did not have enough strength to
[8:27] live out his own confession. That's
[8:30] where the need for spirit revealed faith
[8:35] comes in because you can have a a
[8:38] knowledgebased faith. Well, I know God's
[8:41] word is true. I know God will do what he
[8:43] says. And then you get in a situation
[8:46] where there's nothing but negative,
[8:48] nothing but doubt, nothing but words of
[8:50] death being spoken around you. And if
[8:53] only you have confidence or faith based
[8:56] on knowledge or what you've been told,
[8:59] boy, that shakes. Like Peter's here,
[9:02] that really shakes. Peter made this
[9:04] amazing profession, but it was based on
[9:07] what he knew about himself. He thought
[9:10] the strength that he had to be faithful
[9:13] to his dedication to the Lord, but he
[9:15] didn't have enough spirit revealed faith
[9:19] to have the strength that was necessary
[9:22] to live out that confession. I want us
[9:25] to see this through the scripture so
[9:28] that we can believe God for a faith
[9:31] revealed by the spirit. So that when we
[9:34] get tested and tried, we don't just make
[9:36] these big mouth confessions like Peter
[9:39] did, but we actually have the strength,
[9:42] the courage, the stability to keep that
[9:45] confession, to live it out. And God is
[9:48] able to give us grace to do that. Let's
[9:52] look at another place uh concerning
[9:54] Peter. Luke chap 22 uh beginning in
[9:58] verse 31 through verse 34. And the Lord
[10:02] said,"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath
[10:06] desired to have you." Oh, that's not
[10:09] good news. That he might sift you as
[10:13] wheat. But this is good news. Verse 32,
[10:17] "But I have prayed for thee." Oh friend,
[10:21] Jesus said to Peter, you are going to be
[10:25] sifted as wheat, but I have prayed for
[10:28] you that what? Thy faith fail not. Do
[10:34] you know it could almost have been said
[10:36] that you have the right kind of faith?
[10:39] It actually says that thy faith fail
[10:41] not. But it could have easily have been
[10:43] worded that you have the right kind of
[10:46] faith. The kind of faith that lasts. the
[10:49] kind of faith that gives you strength to
[10:52] live out your confession. It's easy to
[10:54] say it. It's easy to make a confession
[10:57] of faith, but it's a little harder when
[11:00] you get in the stormy winds of life to
[11:02] live that out. Jesus said, "I have
[11:05] prayed for thee that thy faith fail not,
[11:08] and when thou art converted, uh-oh, when
[11:12] thou art converted, strengthen thy
[11:15] brethren." You see Jesus saw that Peter
[11:19] had a knowledgebased faith. He believed
[11:23] and based on his knowledge of believing.
[11:26] I believe he thought that was going to
[11:30] be enough. And the Lord looked deeper
[11:32] than that and saw there was something
[11:34] missing in his spirit. He needed a
[11:36] revelation. He needed God to open up his
[11:39] heart and fulfill this uh desire. You
[11:44] know, Peter had a burning desire to know
[11:46] the Lord, but he his heart needed to be
[11:49] opened up a little bit. And here's the
[11:51] rest of this. Verse 33. And he said unto
[11:54] him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee
[11:57] both into prison and to death. What?
[12:01] I'll go with you all the way to death.
[12:03] He said, and he said, verse 34, I tell
[12:06] thee, Peter, the shall not crow
[12:09] this day before that thou shalt thrice
[12:13] deny that thou knowest me. Here it is
[12:18] again, a great indictment, not against
[12:21] Peter, but an indictment concerning
[12:24] Peter's lack of spirit revealed faith.
[12:28] Faith by revelation. The reason why
[12:31] Peter had never failed like this before
[12:34] is because he'd never been faced with
[12:37] this kind of a situation or these
[12:39] particular circumstances
[12:41] before. New circumstances in our life
[12:45] and new situations in our life can often
[12:48] put us in very vulnerable places. In
[12:52] those moments, we must never rely on
[12:55] what we think we know. We must only rely
[12:58] on what we believe that has been
[13:02] revealed to us by the spirit. Not a
[13:04] belief up here, but a belief that comes
[13:06] from down in here. That's what the
[13:08] spirit of God does by revelation. It
[13:11] takes a a knowledge, a fact from the
[13:14] word that you have heard and it drives
[13:17] it down into your heart. Oh God, do that
[13:20] for every one of your children. Help us
[13:22] to take what we've received up here and
[13:25] let it be driven down in our heart where
[13:28] a friend of ours says uh may God take
[13:31] this truth and drive it from your head
[13:33] to your heart and then to your hands and
[13:35] feet so that you can live it out. That's
[13:38] what is necessary for faith to be lived.
[13:42] And in order for faith to be lived, it
[13:45] has to become a revelation. It has to be
[13:48] revealed to us by the spirit of God. We
[13:51] cannot rely on what we believe with our
[13:53] head, with our mind. We can only rely on
[13:58] a revelation that comes by the spirit
[14:01] from the word. Peter was leaning on his
[14:04] intellectual concept of faith and it
[14:08] failed him and that caused him to fail.
[14:12] His intellectual faith was not enough to
[14:15] hold him, but his revelation was enough
[14:20] to pull him back to truth. See, he did
[14:22] have a revelation. It wasn't a complete
[14:25] revelation, but it was a powerful
[14:28] revelation. And I want to share that
[14:30] with you. Let's look at Matthew chapter
[14:33] 16, beginning in verse 13, and let's
[14:37] read all perhaps all the way down to
[14:40] verse 20.
[14:42] When Jesus came into the coast of
[14:44] Cesaria Philippi, he asked his
[14:47] disciples, saying, "Whom do men say that
[14:51] I, the son of man, am?" And they said,
[14:55] "Some say thou art John the Baptist,
[14:58] some Elias, that would be Elijah, and
[15:01] others Jeremas or one of the prophets.
[15:04] He saith unto them, but whom say ye that
[15:08] I am?" And Simon Peter answered and
[15:11] said,"Thou art the Messiah." King James
[15:15] says, "Christ, the Son of the living
[15:18] God." And Jesus answered and said unto
[15:21] him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah,
[15:25] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[15:28] unto thee." See, this is not a mental
[15:31] concept. This is not someone teaching
[15:33] you and you heard it. Something bigger
[15:36] is happening here.
[15:38] Peter, flesh and blood hath not revealed
[15:41] it unto thee, but my father which is in
[15:43] heaven. See, it was a heavenly
[15:46] revelation. It was a revelation that
[15:48] came from the heaven by the spirit to
[15:51] Peter. And he said, I say also unto thee
[15:54] that thou art Peter, and upon this rock,
[15:57] not Peter, but upon the revelation, I
[16:00] will build my church, and the gates of
[16:02] hell shall not prevail against it. and I
[16:04] will give unto thee the keys of the
[16:06] kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou
[16:08] shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
[16:10] heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose
[16:12] on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Then
[16:15] charged he his disciples that they
[16:17] should tell no man that he was Jesus the
[16:19] Christ. Now Peter had a revelation of
[16:23] who Jesus was, who Jesus is. And that
[16:27] revelation in itself was enough to pull
[16:31] Peter back when he almost lost his own
[16:36] life. Peter knew by revelation who Jesus
[16:40] was and he could never ever ever deny
[16:44] that. It would have been impossible for
[16:47] him to deny who Jesus was. But that's
[16:51] not what he was confronted with. If if
[16:54] you'll notice in the scriptures that
[16:56] we'll read in a moment, it wasn't who
[16:58] Jesus is that Peter was being tempted
[17:01] with, that was not the temptation to
[17:04] deny. It was something entirely
[17:06] different. As we just read, he went on
[17:08] to deny that he was identified with him.
[17:12] He denied his relationship with Jesus,
[17:15] not who Jesus was. A moment after Jesus
[17:19] confirmed Peter's revelation about his
[17:22] true identity, we see that he was still
[17:24] functioning in the strength of his
[17:26] flesh. See, Peter was hard to learn.
[17:29] Look at this verse with me quickly.
[17:32] Matthew 16 verse 21, 22, and 23. From
[17:36] that time forth, this was right after he
[17:39] gets this amazing revelation that Jesus
[17:43] is truly the promised Messiah. From that
[17:46] time forth, Jesus began to show unto his
[17:50] disciples how that he must go unto
[17:52] Jerusalem and suffer many things of the
[17:55] elders and chief priests and scribes and
[17:58] be killed and be raised again the third
[18:00] day. Then Peter took him, listen to
[18:03] this, then Peter took him and began to
[18:06] rebuke him, saying, "Be it far from
[18:10] thee, Lord, this shall not be unto
[18:13] thee." See, Peter loved the Lord and he
[18:16] could not accept the fact that the Lord
[18:19] was going to have to suffer and that he
[18:21] was going to be killed. It was more than
[18:24] Peter could swallow. and in his passion
[18:28] and in his I don't know if it was
[18:30] frustration or what the right word would
[18:32] be to use here but in that uh heat of
[18:35] the moment in that passion of the moment
[18:38] instead of saying you know this this
[18:40] just can't be in fact he rebuked the
[18:43] Lord he it was almost like he was
[18:45] bringing an accusation against the Lord
[18:47] he was doing it in a way that was not
[18:50] very honoring and not very respectful
[18:53] but the Lord recognized it knew where it
[18:55] was coming from. And he turned and said
[18:57] to Peter, "Get thee behind me, Satan."
[19:02] Now, was Jesus calling Peter Satan? I
[19:05] don't think so. But Jesus recognized in
[19:09] Peter Satan's language, Satan's
[19:12] vocabulary.
[19:14] You see, the Lord already knew that
[19:16] Satan would do everything that he could
[19:19] to keep this whole scenario from uh
[19:23] coming to pass exactly like the Lord
[19:25] said it would. You see, it would have
[19:27] been the desire of Satan to kill the
[19:30] Lord and leave him in the tomb, but he
[19:33] didn't have power to keep him there. And
[19:35] so, this was really Satan's uh ambition
[19:39] was to prevent the whole scenario from
[19:42] from coming to pass. He didn't mind the
[19:44] Lord being killed, but he didn't want
[19:46] this resurrection stuff. And so Peter
[19:49] rebuked the Lord. He said, "This will
[19:51] never be." And Jesus said, "Get thee
[19:54] behind me, Satan. Thou art an offense
[19:57] unto me. For thou savorest not the
[19:59] things that be of God, but those that be
[20:02] of men." In other words, Peter, you're
[20:04] being selfish. You It's nice that you
[20:06] love me, but you can't get in God's way.
[20:10] and and what would make you think that
[20:12] you could stand up and get in God's way?
[20:15] This was a lack of maturity and it was
[20:18] it was proof positive that although
[20:20] Peter had a powerful revelation, it was
[20:23] not a complete revelation. There were
[20:25] some things that Peter still knew in his
[20:28] head. There were some things that Peter
[20:30] now knew in his heart, but there were
[20:33] still too many things that Peter knew in
[20:36] his head. Peter was actually still
[20:38] pretty concerned about his own
[20:40] reputation, his own standing in the
[20:43] community. But I want you to know a few
[20:46] moments later when that old rooster
[20:48] began to preach his sermon, Peter knew
[20:52] that he had indeed done the very thing
[20:54] he said he would never do. Said, "I
[20:56] would never deny you. I would never be
[20:59] offended because of you."
[21:02] Let's look at Luke 22:es
[21:05] 54-62 real quickly here. Then took they
[21:08] him and led him and brought him into the
[21:11] high priest's house. And Peter followed
[21:13] a farar off. And when they had kindled a
[21:16] fire in the midst of the hall, and were
[21:19] sat down together, Peter sat down among
[21:21] them. But a certain maid beheld him as
[21:25] he sat by the fire and earnestly looked
[21:28] upon him and said, "This man was also
[21:31] with him." And he denied him,
[21:34] saying,"Woman, I know him not." And
[21:37] after a little while, another saw him,
[21:39] and said, "Thou art also of them." And
[21:41] Peter said, "Man, I am not." And about
[21:45] the space of one hour, after another
[21:47] confidently affirmed, saying of a truth,
[21:50] this fellow also was with him, for he is
[21:52] a Galilean. And Peter said, Man, I know
[21:55] not what thou sayest. And immediately,
[21:58] while he yet spake, the crew, the
[22:01] rooster let out his cockal doodle,
[22:04] didn't he? And the Lord turned and
[22:06] looked upon Peter. Oh my. And Peter
[22:09] remembered the word of the Lord, how he
[22:12] had said unto him before the cockcrow,
[22:15] "Thou shalt deny me" thrice. And Peter
[22:18] went out and wept bitterly. The very
[22:23] words that Peter said, "I'll never do,"
[22:26] were the very things that Peter ended up
[22:28] doing. Notice, not any of these
[22:30] questions was, "Is Jesus the Messiah?"
[22:34] Perhaps if they would have asked Peter
[22:36] that, he would have had to say, "Yes, he
[22:38] is." Because he had a revelation of
[22:40] that. Each one of these questions was,
[22:43] "Are you one of them? I think you're one
[22:45] of them. I think you have relationship
[22:48] with him." And so, Peter's confidence
[22:51] was in the Lord. But he didn't have
[22:53] enough confidence in his relationship
[22:56] with the Lord. That's where we're
[22:58] tested. We are tested on our fellowship,
[23:02] our relationship with the Lord Jesus
[23:04] Christ. That's what Satan is after.
[23:06] He'll do anything and everything. He'll
[23:09] use anybody that will yield to him to
[23:12] put a wedge between you and an intimate
[23:15] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[23:18] This is why it is vitally important in
[23:21] this hour that we get a faith that comes
[23:24] by revelation. One that is driven by the
[23:27] Holy Spirit from our head, our
[23:29] intellect, our mental concept all the
[23:32] way down into the inner being of our
[23:35] spirit. So that when we face these kinds
[23:37] of moments where Satan is testing us and
[23:40] trying us, we have more than just a
[23:43] testimony of what we think we know. We
[23:45] have a noso. That's the way the
[23:47] old-timers used to say it. We need a not
[23:50] a think so salvation. They said we need
[23:52] a noso salvation. How many of you know
[23:55] the difference? I think I'm saved. I
[23:58] think I'm I'm right with God. And I know
[24:00] that I am. Well, some people say if you
[24:04] make such a statement, I know that I'm a
[24:06] child of God. That that's rooted in
[24:08] pride. I believe it's rooted in a
[24:11] revelation of faith. The Bible said they
[24:13] will know they're saved, not think they
[24:16] are. They will know they're saved by the
[24:19] quickening of their spirit or in their
[24:22] spirit. That word quickening means to
[24:25] come alive. It also means resurrection.
[24:28] So they will know they're saved because
[24:30] there's a resurrection going on in their
[24:33] spirit man. That is a revelation. That's
[24:36] more than a head concept. That's more
[24:39] than a mental idea. I'm going to ask God
[24:42] to give you more than a mental idea. You
[24:46] see, what Peter was missing was what God
[24:49] wanted to do for him in the upper room.
[24:51] He just hadn't gotten that far yet.
[24:54] Remember, it's a journey. We're not born
[24:56] again one minute and a mature, adopted
[24:59] son of God the next minute. No, this is
[25:03] a journey toward the kingdom of God. And
[25:06] there's going to be many hills and
[25:08] valleys. There's going to be many curves
[25:10] in the road. You know, I don't know if
[25:12] you've ever read the Pilgrim's Progress,
[25:14] but if you have, you'll identify your
[25:16] own life in it because there's going to
[25:19] be places of temptation, places of
[25:21] discouragement, places where you feel
[25:23] like you just want to throw in the towel
[25:26] and give it all up. But don't you dare
[25:28] do it, brother. Don't you dare do it,
[25:31] sister. Greater is he that is in you
[25:34] than he that is in the world. I'm going
[25:36] to pray right now. We'll finish this uh
[25:40] another time or we'll get another
[25:41] installment of it the next time we're
[25:43] together. But right now, I want to pray
[25:45] that God will begin to open up a real
[25:48] revelation by faith in your life.
[25:50] Father, these are your children. And I
[25:54] love them. And that's why I'm here to
[25:55] minister to them. But I can only do so
[25:58] much. I can only show them the
[26:01] scripture, talk to them a little bit
[26:04] according to how you've revealed truths
[26:06] to me. But I I need you and they need
[26:09] you to come and take this message of
[26:11] truth that you've given us in your word
[26:15] and let it become a living revelation in
[26:18] us. Oh father, let not just our mind get
[26:22] a hold of it but let our spirit get a
[26:24] hold of it until it becomes a revelation
[26:26] of faith. Let our faith not be a mental
[26:29] concept only, but let it become a
[26:32] revelation from the heavenlies, from the
[26:35] spirit of almighty God. Release healing
[26:37] to those who need healing so
[26:40] desperately. In the name of the Lord
[26:42] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And amen. I
[26:47] want to thank you once again for
[26:49] faithfully watching the eagles cry. And
[26:52] I want you to know that we're praying
[26:54] for you and believing God to perform his
[26:57] wonderful word in your life. Don't you
[27:00] dare give up on the brink of your
[27:02] miracle. The enemy will discourage you.
[27:05] He'll tell you it'll never come. We get
[27:08] awful tired of waiting sometime. And our
[27:11] hope feels like hope deferred. But I
[27:14] want you to know a joy comes in the
[27:16] morning. They used to say the darkest
[27:18] hour is just before the dawn when the
[27:21] sun comes up. I believe it's often times
[27:23] that way. Don't you forget the sun is
[27:26] going to rise again in your life. Thank
[27:29] you again for watching. Bye-bye. Until
[27:32] next time.
