Description:
God has a destiny, a purpose, a plan for our life. The One true God, Jehovah God of the Old Testament, who is Jesus of the New, has always been jealous over us. He has protected us when we were yet in sin. He was there with us on the bar stool, in the crack house, or even on the abortion table, because He knew our destiny and purpose. He loved us and knew us before the foundation of the world. The Scripture says, “You have not chosen Me, I have chosen you,” saith the Lord!
