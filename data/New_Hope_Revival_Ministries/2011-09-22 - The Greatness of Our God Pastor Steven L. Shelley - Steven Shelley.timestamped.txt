[0:00] but I said there are multiple universes
[0:02] out there no one has reached the great
[0:04] beyond no one knows the end of this
[0:07] universe but God nobody knows how far it
[0:09] goes and expands I tell you we serve a
[0:12] great God I tell you we think he stays
[0:15] busy just keeping this little thing in
[0:17] orbit and take I tell you he's got more
[0:19] to take care of out there in the
[0:21] expanses of the of time and existence
[0:24] that we don't know anything about and
[0:25] he's capable of doing all of it and he
[0:27] never has to tie a string on his finger
[0:30] to remember what he's supposed to do
[0:31] next Hallelujah and he never has to set
[0:33] an alarm on his iPhone to remember to
[0:36] spin the Earth again that's the God we
[0:38] serve he doesn't have to remember to
[0:41] recharge gravity Hallelujah because when
[0:44] he created it it did what he told it to
[0:47] do and it always has and it always will
[0:51] and if a God is busy enough and yet
[0:54] capable enough of running that I
[0:57] guarantee you he's capable of healing
[1:00] your body when you're sick and cheering
[1:03] you up when you're sad and protecting
[1:06] your children when they're out from
[1:07] under your roof Hallelujah let's give
[1:11] God praise come
[1:15] hallelujah praise
[1:18] God I believe I'll serve that God I
[1:21] believe I'll live my life for that God I
[1:24] believe I'll lay down everything I have
[1:26] for that
[1:28] God hallelujah
[1:32] Lord
