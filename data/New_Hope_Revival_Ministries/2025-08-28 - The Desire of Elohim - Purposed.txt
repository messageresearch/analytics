Description:
Before the foundation of the world, God dwelt alone with His thoughts—Elohim, full of attributes.

In those attributes, He already saw a counterpart.
Just as Eve was in Adam before she was ever formed, the Bride was in Christ before creation.

The Creator looked for fellowship, and what He longed for was already in Him.

From the beginning, He desired intimacy—not of flesh, but of spirit.
The reality is this: God purposed a people in Christ, one with Him, to be His bride and His joy.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
The reality is one with him. &gt;&gt; The reality is before the foundations of this world, God desired to have fellowship &gt;&gt; he desired to have intimacy, not sexuality, intimacy &gt;&gt; with the people. &gt;&gt; He desired, can you imagine? He desired a counterpart. How unbelievable. [Music] How unbelievable that the creator of all that we know would long to have fellowship with a counterpart when he dwelt alone &gt;&gt; with his thoughts. Elohim. Not a multiple of personality, not a multiple of person, but a multiple of attributes. Elohim, he dwelt alone with his thoughts. And one of those thoughts and some of those attributes are represented in this meeting. He longed to have fellowship. The whole reason why Eve was taken from Adam, it's a part. Look, look, folks, that wasn't the reality. That was the type. The the the reality was there was a a bride in Christ &gt;&gt; from before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; She was in him as an attribute like Eve was inside of Adam &gt;&gt; called he them &gt;&gt; both in the same body. He separated a bride not by a rib. This is metaphor. He longed to have fellowship. and what he was looking for was in him. &gt;&gt; While he's looking around to find it, &gt;&gt; Adam sees the animals with a mate, he has no mate. &gt;&gt; The reason why Adam had to come to this reality is because the creator had already come to the same reality. &gt;&gt; I have no mate. &gt;&gt; I have no wife. I have no bride. I have no counterpart. I fellowship in my own attributes and thoughts. He longed. I tell you folks, if you can get a glimpse of this greatest, it's the greatest romance. &gt;&gt; There is no story like this story. You can't believe it with head knowledge. You can only access it with faith. &gt;&gt; But he found a way. He found a way. And it was an overnight way. It wasn't an instant way. It wasn't a microwavable way. It was a way that would take 6,000 years. and eventually seven church ages &gt;&gt; to even begin to execute it on planet earth. &gt;&gt; First, he wasn't even a god &gt;&gt; because there was nothing to worship him as such. &gt;&gt; So, he had to create a heavenly host &gt;&gt; that would worship him. &gt;&gt; Were they forced to do so? Evidently not, &gt;&gt; right? because a portion of them rebelled and followed Lucifer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, they must have also had an opportunity to decide for themselves &gt;&gt; and you do too. &gt;&gt; Ex's just one little caveat and that is he knew your choice &gt;&gt; before you were ever formed in your mother's womb. &gt;&gt; He already knew your choice. Brother Brandham's preaching about Calvary that day at Calvary and he talks about God reaching in and separating from Christ, the bridegroom, pulling the bride out. Same kind of same kind of typology that we saw over there. It wasn't about Adam. It wasn't even originally about Christ. &gt;&gt; It was about creator. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was about what came forth from the logos. Desiring to have fellowship. &gt;&gt; Did he desire worship? He did. But there was something he desired more than worship. &gt;&gt; Fellow. Someone say it with me. Fellowship. &gt;&gt; Fellowship. Some of you have &gt;&gt; had moments where his presence became so real that it was realer than than your reality. &gt;&gt; And you don't want to strut around the room like a rooster &gt;&gt; when you get in that presence. &gt;&gt; What you really want to do is find a place under the carpet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just let me lay down and get as low as I possibly can in that moment that he has become a covert, a shelter, a tabernacle, shutting out life, shutting me in to his glory.
