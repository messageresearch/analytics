[0:09] hi I'm Joshua Shelli and welcome back to
[0:11] another nhrm podcast today we'll be
[0:14] doing part two of sister Alfreda um if
[0:16] you have not watched the first part I
[0:18] would definitely suggest to go back and
[0:21] watch it and learn about some of uh her
[0:24] family history and how she came into
[0:26] this message um before watching this one
[0:30] definitely go back and watch the first
[0:31] one just to learn a little bit about her
[0:33] and everything but uh we're really
[0:35] excited for the second one and uh we're
[0:37] going to be talking about how she came
[0:39] to this ministry and also going back and
[0:41] telling a couple more of uh the War
[0:43] Stories and so we're really excited so
[0:46] thank you for coming back on for part
[0:48] two thank you for having me we had we
[0:50] had a good time it was good so I'm
[0:53] excited for it was very relaxed so we're
[0:55] good we're good even though you didn't
[0:57] make the coffee I'm sorry hwk made it
[0:59] this time
[1:01] um we wanted we wanted to point out one
[1:03] thing that we were talking about after
[1:04] we got done that we did not mention that
[1:07] your dad actually never came back from
[1:10] the war no he left the beginning of uh
[1:13] November
[1:15] 1944 and the reason he wasn't drafted
[1:18] earlier than that was because he was
[1:21] looking he and another man were looking
[1:23] after all the needs of the people
[1:26] because all the other men were gone the
[1:30] Army and so um you know he he belonged
[1:34] to the fire department and all
[1:37] everything else that would so I I me
[1:39] when you think about that it even shows
[1:42] like how tough your mom really wasz now
[1:44] she did everything by herself and even
[1:46] moved everyone to Canada I mean
[1:48] completely by herself yeah I tell you it
[1:52] took the Lord for sure really took the
[1:54] Lord for sure I believe it but um yeah
[1:57] my dad never returned he he was 38 years
[2:01] old when he left and uh um you know it
[2:07] was I I never realized how hard it
[2:11] really was growing up without a dad I
[2:13] mean that was just you know you took it
[2:17] into stride because I hardly knew him I
[2:20] had one one experience that I remember
[2:24] very clearly very vividly and that was
[2:28] uh he had made some a a swing in the
[2:34] woods and you know when I was just
[2:36] little you know just a little over two
[2:39] and I was one of my siblings had me on
[2:43] their on their knee and was swinging as
[2:47] high as and to this day I can still feel
[2:50] that thing you know coming down like so
[2:55] dad was coming out and I was screaming
[2:58] my head off and he he just consoled me
[3:02] and I remember that feeling you know
[3:04] that and scolded my sibling whoever that
[3:07] was so that was a but you know those
[3:11] things are very important when that's
[3:13] all you have for sure okay remember the
[3:15] little
[3:17] things but um the Lord did something for
[3:20] me this year at the beginning of the
[3:22] year and um what he's doing he's going
[3:27] through my life
[3:30] um I think it's part of that Hoopa
[3:34] experience that he is taking out all the
[3:40] hurts and the pain like he has to with
[3:43] with all of us because you know we've
[3:46] got to come forth in in his Integrity
[3:49] his character his Beauty his love and
[3:53] all but we can't have any of those scars
[3:56] he's going to take that all away so
[4:00] um this it was sometime in January and I
[4:04] didn't realize how how much I really
[4:07] missed my dad like growing up and um I
[4:11] had that that experience was so vivid
[4:16] that I I'm going to tell it because we
[4:20] don't know how many people are out there
[4:23] and don't know how to deal with these
[4:26] situations and
[4:28] so in in that experience I heard someone
[4:33] say come your your dad wants to see you
[4:38] and I found myself walking down a
[4:41] hallway and
[4:42] thinking I am going to meet a perfect
[4:46] stranger I don't know him you know I was
[4:49] two and a half so um and then I thought
[4:55] what language is he going to speak to me
[4:58] is cuz I know he would have spoken a lot
[5:01] of Russian or or German or you know
[5:05] would we even be able to communicate and
[5:09] I you know crazy things you think it
[5:13] yeah those times so finally I got to the
[5:18] door and I came to this big room and
[5:21] there was a a chair behi right near the
[5:25] entrance and I saw my siblings sitting
[5:28] there kind of in a
[5:31] semicircle and I thought well I know you
[5:33] all you know I want to see my
[5:35] dad and so I walked
[5:38] around and very much afraid of of you
[5:43] know what am I going to experience here
[5:46] and then he sat there and then he just
[5:48] smiled and he stretched out his hands
[5:51] and he and I just ran to him and hugged
[5:54] him and hugged him we both cried and all
[5:57] of a sudden it seemed like I came came
[5:59] back to being little you know he took me
[6:03] on his lap and I asked him all kinds of
[6:07] questions and uh he answered them and
[6:10] then I I asked why didn't you come back
[6:13] to us then then he just put his head
[6:16] down as if he couldn't answer and then I
[6:20] Heard a Voice saying
[6:23] 1950 and I take it that the Lord was
[6:27] telling me he died in 1950
[6:30] yeah we know that he survived the war he
[6:33] we had um I don't have it here but we
[6:36] did receive a couple of cards and he was
[6:39] a prisoner of war the Russians captured
[6:41] him on the other side of
[6:45] Dresden and um he was in in we knew that
[6:50] he was near the Black Sea and later on
[6:52] to the taken to the uh Peninsula Cola
[6:57] and up after that we I mean we don't
[7:01] there was no direct communication except
[7:05] you know they they he said he was in
[7:08] Russian a a Russian uh prisoner War but
[7:12] it was scratched out so we don't know
[7:15] the camp or anything where he was at oh
[7:17] wow but
[7:18] so yeah that's what happened to my dad
[7:21] but he never oh I just wanted to C that
[7:23] you didn't get to on the last one yes um
[7:25] and there was another story that you
[7:27] wanted to tell I did because because it
[7:30] uh we all hear about Dresden M and it
[7:34] happened you know the Allies bombed the
[7:36] city of Dron it was it was a beautiful
[7:40] um beautiful city really it was one of
[7:43] it they they uh used that to uh keep
[7:47] records and you know a lot of the birth
[7:50] certificates and you know it was and uh
[7:53] so much of it was destroyed because of
[7:56] that then I don't know why they selected
[7:59] Dresden but what I remember so vividly
[8:03] it seems like my siblings don't remember
[8:07] it but but I do it was like I'm
[8:10] experiencing it right here I was we I
[8:14] was sitting in the center of that
[8:16] wagon and just nonchalant you know just
[8:21] I looked up to the sky and I saw the
[8:23] bombers coming from the you know there
[8:26] was I don't know there must have been
[8:28] about eight or there were a lot I've
[8:30] I've seen the pictures of Dron and it
[8:33] was exactly like
[8:35] that and then as I I gazed up and I and
[8:39] all of a sudden something
[8:42] dropped and then the next thing that
[8:44] happened was this horrible
[8:47] explosion and there was a a wall of fire
[8:51] to me it seemed you know as a child that
[8:54] had reached the heaven like as high as I
[8:56] could look and um uh and then I heard
[9:02] the noise like the people
[9:04] screaming and the horses raring up and
[9:08] Chaos all around me how far were y'all
[9:11] from that would y'all must been pretty
[9:14] close it well yeah it would probably
[9:18] Mama thought it was maybe about 10 kilm
[9:21] or so but you know but it's like I don't
[9:24] know I don't know but that's my memory
[9:28] of it and it was horrifying W so I think
[9:32] brother um prear I think they he lived
[9:36] he lived in
[9:38] um I think he lived in dryon cuz he yes
[9:42] so but 98% of it the City was destroyed
[9:46] completely they said the temperatures
[9:49] were uh almost at like 2,000 de it was
[9:52] it was hardly anybody would have
[9:54] survived wow yeah it was horrible but
[9:58] mhm now we we discussed a little bit
[10:01] yesterday yes about um your experience
[10:04] in brother brandom's um yes meetings and
[10:07] stuff and I know you wanted to share
[10:10] because because in the tapes and stuff
[10:13] all they have is uh a woman speaking in
[10:16] tongues and you actually have have I TP
[10:19] I typed it out yeah just one moment and
[10:22] so if you'd like to share that that
[10:24] would be really
[10:26] good yeah it was quite an experience you
[10:28] know that but I'll have to take my
[10:30] glasses off so I can see I think I've
[10:33] got it here birth pains this is what she
[10:37] prophesied first of all brother brandham
[10:40] was speaking about and I got the last
[10:42] paragraph written here because he was he
[10:44] was he said look at the increase across
[10:47] the world recently you ought to get in
[10:50] my office and read the letters from the
[10:53] mothers for their boys and homosexuality
[10:56] is in the in on the increase and I think
[10:59] I think it's somewhere between 20 and
[11:00] 30% and in Cal in California alone over
[11:05] the last year and a great bunch of even
[11:08] government people have proven to be you
[11:11] know you're go you government men know
[11:13] that your magazine I read it and I've
[11:16] taken and all of a sudden this woman she
[11:20] sat quite close to the front I I don't
[11:23] know I think maybe the second or third
[11:24] row not too far from us she stands up
[11:28] and she prophesies speaks in tongues and
[11:32] then she gets louder and louder uh you
[11:34] can hear it on the
[11:36] two it is coming it is coming it is
[11:40] coming the Wrath and she she rolled her
[11:43] eyes like that wrath you of the Living
[11:47] God it is coming it is coming it is
[11:51] coming the Wrath of the Living God for
[11:55] surely iniquity does abound iniquity
[11:58] does abound found yay the Living God has
[12:02] witnessed today that his people yay draw
[12:06] nearer to him and cry for the mercy of
[12:09] the Living God for the land is
[12:12] entrenched with
[12:14] iniquity and then she speaks in tongues
[12:17] and let God witness with the message the
[12:21] message and she gets louder she said it
[12:24] four times the message the message that
[12:27] God brought the almighty God the god of
[12:31] Abraham the god of Isaac the god of
[12:35] Jacob Witnesses he Witnesses with the
[12:39] message that has gone
[12:41] forth so I thought it was very important
[12:45] because you the atmosphere was I was say
[12:48] what was it like after that like what
[12:50] what were people what was brother
[12:52] brandom doing after that what brother
[12:54] Brown um he acknowledged it immediately
[12:58] and he said said that God has spoken he
[13:00] did not mind being
[13:02] interrupted because apparently this
[13:04] woman has never spoken in tongues or has
[13:07] never prophesied it just happened there
[13:10] that's what I heard wow mhm but the next
[13:13] very next day after he related that
[13:17] experience and I'm going to give you the
[13:19] date that would be the 25th of January
[13:23] and uh 65 so in case anybody wants to
[13:27] look it up I think brother Bram came
[13:30] back we weren't there anymore cuz we
[13:32] left that morning but he uh they
[13:36] acknowledged the whole thing that God
[13:38] had
[13:39] spoken and um it they allowed him to
[13:44] relate what had really happened you know
[13:47] what the Lord had explained to him about
[13:49] that scripture so I would rather you
[13:51] know I just want to give you the
[13:53] reference so in case anybody wants to
[13:55] read it yeah it's it was very important
[13:59] and immediately after he was finished
[14:02] with
[14:03] that then that same voice that same
[14:06] woman gets up and
[14:09] prophesies and again you know it's the
[14:12] message and it is coming it is coming
[14:15] and then so it's kind of hard to hear
[14:19] I'm going to really try to to get it but
[14:24] um if I do I'll just text it yeah and
[14:27] you know but this one here was the one
[14:29] that I had heard so she actually
[14:30] prophesied twice yes okay on on the 24th
[14:34] of January and the 25th 25th and the
[14:37] following month when it was at the same
[14:39] time when brother Bram spoke about on
[14:42] marriage and divorce in that those those
[14:45] meetings he uh preached a sermon
[14:48] entitled this day the scriptures
[14:51] fulfilled and
[14:53] um in on he mentions it there again and
[14:58] he relates the whole thing about the
[15:01] priest uh Bishop Stanley speaking to him
[15:05] and that actually in his conversation
[15:09] with
[15:10] with with him on the platform he said
[15:14] she gets up and prophesies wow and this
[15:17] was the importance you know to me that
[15:19] was very very important was was there
[15:23] anything else in those meetings that
[15:25] really stuck like stuck out to you or or
[15:28] or anything or any Miracles that
[15:30] happened or anything that well he had a
[15:32] prayer line but at that time yes it was
[15:35] but uh it seemed like there was much
[15:38] more the emphasis on on the word and
[15:41] what and the Judgment that was there
[15:43] there was such a transition taking place
[15:46] M you know in in 64 and 65 there was
[15:53] um I remember Oral Roberts was supposed
[15:56] to have been attending those services
[15:59] and he didn't come and Isaac sharen the
[16:03] father he had died several months before
[16:06] that and so he was um
[16:10] um what I had heard there at the time
[16:14] was that he made his son promise that he
[16:18] would always keep the door open for
[16:20] brother brandham and that was probably
[16:23] because towards the end you know it was
[16:25] brother brandham had almost you know
[16:26] almost every door was closed yeah and it
[16:29] had to happen wow But but so that was
[16:33] kind of the atmosphere what what was it
[16:36] like like well how did you feel driving
[16:39] home after attending those meetings um
[16:42] did you feel excited
[16:44] or yes but see I didn't don't forget I
[16:48] had
[16:50] just
[16:51] um really you know with that experience
[16:54] I shared with you I had to kind of
[16:57] digest that all because because you had
[17:01] never seen that no no now I do want to
[17:05] remember one other thing that in
[17:09] 1963 it was when I had gone to that
[17:12] Baptist
[17:13] College and um and I had my that uh the
[17:18] Holy Ghost baptism I received that and
[17:21] afterwards you know we had these friends
[17:24] and
[17:25] somehow someone played um
[17:29] a tape of brother brandham really yes
[17:32] and so the very first tape I heard was
[17:36] uh Souls that are imprison now and and
[17:39] in the Baptist College yes well at that
[17:42] time I yeah I heard yes but um it so
[17:48] shook me you know here I had that
[17:51] experience with the Lord yeah and it
[17:53] made me so aware of the
[17:55] Supernatural and he says so many serious
[17:59] serious things on there that I thought
[18:01] what is Happ I thought I have to get
[18:03] saved all over again yeah it was I
[18:06] remember for about 3 days I was just
[18:08] walking in a days it affected me that
[18:11] much yeah and uh you know and that would
[18:14] have been around the time when he was
[18:16] preaching the seals but you know we were
[18:19] not in contact with him but I do know a
[18:23] lady who was in Jeffersonville at the
[18:26] time when he preached uh SS out are in
[18:28] prison oh really yes and she said the
[18:32] people didn't even wait to get to the
[18:35] altar they just streamed it was like
[18:37] they were falling over each other
[18:40] because that time is was so serious and
[18:43] look at now we are so so much closer
[18:46] sure so I don't know how many uh you
[18:49] know people are I'm just saying these
[18:51] things here to point them to to what had
[18:56] really happened at that time oh
[19:00] now when you got home from those those
[19:03] meetings what was it did you go in and
[19:05] tell your mom what had happened or oh
[19:07] they knew something had happened to me
[19:09] you acted completely different yes yeah
[19:12] it changed me changed me a lot I never
[19:14] went back to that place that was it and
[19:17] we started listening to tapes I I mean
[19:21] just the few that we could get a hold of
[19:25] and um I listened to the seals
[19:30] and it was like a new world had opened
[19:32] up to me you know the reality of the day
[19:34] we're living in that it's like we're on
[19:38] the edge of something so huge now how
[19:41] much more than we were then for sure do
[19:44] you have a favorite tape or message by
[19:46] Brother Bren oh there's so many so many
[19:50] they're really what's some of your
[19:52] favorites I really really enjoyed what's
[19:56] the attraction on the mountain what the
[19:58] date on that cuz I know you know it it
[20:01] actually I don't really no I figured you
[20:04] would no I know I'm sorry I put you on
[20:06] the spot no I don't care no but uh it it
[20:12] it was one of the last later ones you
[20:14] know that but what yeah it was you could
[20:18] just picture him moving on that and and
[20:23] it was it was very special to me but
[20:25] this one on Souls that are in prison now
[20:27] I I think everybody ought to hear that
[20:31] that was and it was preached around the
[20:33] time of the seals just before that or
[20:37] what what date you you said that date
[20:39] didn't
[20:40] you it when was it preached it would
[20:42] have been around the time in 63 I 63 I
[20:46] heard it okay
[20:48] yeah so that was yes so that's what you
[20:53] so that's what y'all did for a while was
[20:55] just listen to we listened to that and
[20:57] then the people started started to
[20:58] gather and we listened to a lot of tapes
[21:01] many many and that's um you know trying
[21:06] to get it established my brother Billy
[21:08] Paul came to Canada so did Brother
[21:11] Collins there were several yeah of the
[21:13] ministers but um um you know we we
[21:20] especially after brother bham had died
[21:22] you know we lived that whole whole uh
[21:27] week you know when he between the 18th
[21:30] and the 24th you know we received
[21:33] reports every day sometimes two or three
[21:36] because the people really were expecting
[21:38] him to rise I
[21:40] mean like I said yesterday it was it was
[21:43] such a shock and yet he had warned the
[21:47] people anybody who would have listened
[21:49] like in on the Easter seal he had said
[21:54] um he said I see my end at 56 years old
[21:59] and different times he was prophesying
[22:02] his departure he he knew he was going
[22:06] but uh he was trying to prepare the
[22:09] people but you know oh no it just wasn't
[22:12] going to happen no he was going to have
[22:14] tent meetings and like we all we were
[22:17] preparing to you know during the
[22:20] vacation time or somehow during that
[22:22] year to go try to attend some of the
[22:25] services and that and then what a
[22:28] shocker it was um extremely in what year
[22:32] did you hear about the ministry
[22:35] here um actually in ' 92 going start
[22:39] talking about that a little bit yes um
[22:43] actually it was right after there were
[22:44] some of the folks from Edmonton had been
[22:47] in the two sound meetings and they came
[22:50] back with some of the tapes so we heard
[22:52] you know like mule religion and uh uh
[22:57] 12o Shuffle you know those Classics have
[22:59] you heard them I have I've heard troph
[23:01] Shuffle I haven't heard the other one oh
[23:03] yeah and one more night with the Frog
[23:05] I've heard that one CU he's repr
[23:06] preached it since then but I didn't hear
[23:08] several times I didn't hear the original
[23:09] one yes and uh no it was really it was
[23:14] really good I knew there was something
[23:16] there and so then
[23:19] um that's when I went to visit my niece
[23:23] Esther Judith's sister she lived when so
[23:26] when brother shell came to
[23:28] uh an arbor
[23:31] um I really enjoyed those services so
[23:34] that was the first time where you yes
[23:36] and that would have been in April
[23:38] 992 okay yeah and then I I remember
[23:43] talking to him and inviting him to come
[23:46] to Edmonton did you know that I didn't
[23:49] know it yes because you know people the
[23:54] message folks were very
[23:56] closed and so
[23:58] so we were talking about and he promised
[24:01] he would come so he did I still have the
[24:05] I still have those tapes they're very
[24:07] very yes I do and uh were so he came in
[24:14] May
[24:15] 92 90 yes '
[24:18] 92 and he went to Scott as
[24:22] well and uh that's where Laurel Laurel's
[24:27] brother I think had invited her and so
[24:29] we were all working together and so but
[24:32] those those first meetings they were
[24:35] they were really good we had about 40
[24:39] people in our basement wow was yes and
[24:43] so just in y'all's house yes in our
[24:46] basement I didn't know that it's I did
[24:48] not if I did I forgot it uhhuh it's for
[24:51] the first meeting were yes uh and some
[24:53] of you know the I guess I'm just going
[24:55] to say it you know some of the
[24:58] the folks they were pretty
[25:01] mean it's okay you need you know that
[25:04] anyway don't you
[25:06] um so when did you decide to move down
[25:10] here to come okay here okay we we had
[25:15] started um even throughout throughout
[25:19] the year I had
[25:21] heard the the message
[25:25] on no strength to to bring forth from
[25:29] Mesa okay have you ever seen that I
[25:32] don't think so I don't know if you have
[25:33] the teeth but
[25:35] that that was
[25:37] something
[25:39] else I I'm I saw some of the people on
[25:44] the platform the preachers I mean they
[25:47] couldn't believe what they were hearing
[25:49] they were it and brother shell was bold
[25:53] I'm telling you he was
[25:56] Fearless it it was
[25:59] exactly what was needed but it made it
[26:02] hard for
[26:03] him so did you know that I did not
[26:08] okay so anyway we were so thankful
[26:12] because something was
[26:15] happening and God just
[26:18] broke
[26:19] through and so many people were waiting
[26:23] for something to
[26:25] transpire but um
[26:28] so we passed on these tapes and
[26:31] everywhere and I
[26:33] started um I asked him if I could type
[26:38] and so I typed out two of those sermons
[26:40] one of them was um I think he told his
[26:43] testimonium one and two of
[26:46] them and um I gave him the transcript
[26:49] when he came later on and uh uh somehow
[26:54] it just didn't work out and you know
[26:57] that he was going to put it on paper or
[27:00] try to so anyway I asked him if he did
[27:04] and he said no no I've just not been
[27:07] able to to do that and I said you want
[27:09] me to do it and I
[27:11] said yeah and I I did I
[27:15] just put like put right the vision
[27:18] together from the transcript I mean I
[27:21] knew nothing about his ministry I the
[27:24] only thing I tried to do was just to
[27:28] cause it to flow and I wanted everything
[27:30] to be in his words yeah so some of the
[27:34] uh paragraphs I would take the different
[27:37] you know whenever I would hear something
[27:40] that really stuck out to me when as we
[27:43] were listening to the the stream no the
[27:47] hookup yeah and sometimes I would just
[27:50] take one or two sentences and put them
[27:53] together or so you were doing this long
[27:55] before you moved here yeah okay yeah
[27:58] just put it together it was and whatever
[28:01] I felt I felt really needed to be there
[28:05] I yeah so I typed that up and we were
[28:09] communicating back and forth and I mean
[28:11] it was you know it would be so different
[28:13] today because there's so much that God
[28:17] has done since but I had nothing to go
[28:19] by yeah really just my two sermons you
[28:23] know the testimony does that make sense
[28:26] it does it does okay so when did you
[28:28] actually end up moving here though in
[28:31] May of um
[28:34] 93 they were still Church yes but we
[28:39] were okay we were on the hookup and
[28:42] brother Shelly had come again
[28:45] in uh 92 in September and he brought a
[28:50] mall with
[28:51] him so um so and there was a group a
[28:56] group of us that that you know we were
[29:00] we were really enjoying this so
[29:05] anyway um we had come here drove down
[29:09] here for about 10 days in February and
[29:12] March there were four of us brother the
[29:15] Salvador and Patty and I I think I think
[29:18] Danny was with us so do you know any
[29:22] yeah yeah I know I know that was in the
[29:25] spring in Mar and then we drove back
[29:29] home and in March it was March the
[29:33] 20th uh
[29:35] 93 we were on the
[29:39] hookup and he had had the vision of the
[29:43] platform of of um the
[29:47] Tabernacle and boy that rang true to me
[29:51] you know I wished I could have seen you
[29:53] know he was drawing that and we were you
[29:55] know just on the hook up yeah
[29:58] and um I was I was kind of you know I
[30:01] was sitting there and I think oh Jesus I
[30:04] I want to understand this so badly he
[30:07] was he was
[30:08] covering everything all these questions
[30:12] that I had okay he was speaking about
[30:16] the the bride's Revival about the
[30:21] tent
[30:23] about the Thunders the seventh seal and
[30:27] see when brother Bram
[30:30] died I don't know if I mentioned this
[30:33] yesterday I my the first impact yeah you
[30:38] did that I had it it's so it was like
[30:41] that's what hit me that I had question
[30:45] upon question about this it just it just
[30:48] did me in it it became do you understand
[30:52] that it was and so when he started
[30:56] to uh
[30:58] um you know recollect everything he put
[31:02] the things together the quotes together
[31:05] and I I was sitting there and I thought
[31:08] Lord I want to understand that you see
[31:11] there were so many things we had gone
[31:13] through for instance when it came to the
[31:14] tent
[31:15] Vision
[31:17] um all of
[31:19] these all of
[31:22] these doctrines had come up and I was
[31:26] you know personally
[31:28] told um if you don't see the tent Vision
[31:33] like that and don't believe it the way
[31:35] they did uh you know you're just not
[31:39] going to be a part of that you know I my
[31:42] friends friends told me and you know you
[31:46] have to realize this was just right at
[31:49] the beginning you didn't know which way
[31:51] anything was going it was a lot of
[31:54] turmoil and so my response was is if God
[31:59] is big enough to let me know you know to
[32:03] want me to be and to understand the tent
[32:06] Vision he will let me know I don't have
[32:09] to follow man I will know and he will
[32:13] make sure that I would be there you see
[32:17] that it that I just didn't buy that but
[32:21] then I thought Lord what do you really
[32:23] mean what does that so here I am sitting
[32:26] on the hook
[32:28] up listening to this and having um the
[32:33] seals the seal the seventh seal
[32:36] everything's so uncertain
[32:39] right and all of a sudden this presence
[32:45] comes and I knew I just I just sobbed I
[32:49] just leaned forward and I knew that
[32:52] being was standing right in front of me
[32:55] and he had some kind of of a vessel I
[32:58] didn't dare look up a vessel in his
[33:02] hands I don't know if it was a chofar or
[33:04] whatever it was I don't know I didn't
[33:07] look
[33:08] up and I was sobbing there and all of a
[33:12] sudden he poured out oil that hot oil
[33:16] warm oil all over me that didn't leave
[33:19] for at least 24 hours you know and uh
[33:24] and then I had a vision and I saw a
[33:29] ladder and I knew where I was standing
[33:32] very much on the right on the ground I
[33:34] had and and the ladder was there and
[33:37] there was some kind of a ledge and to
[33:39] the right there was a a room that had
[33:43] the door was just open a little bit and
[33:45] I knew it was very light in there and I
[33:48] needed to go there and he let me
[33:53] know you've got to do a lot of climbing
[33:56] before you you can go there so
[34:00] so and then he also let me know he's
[34:04] going to give the real
[34:06] interpretation of the of the tent Vision
[34:12] here I mean that that's and that's the
[34:15] reason I really felt proud of the Lord
[34:18] to come here he you know there were just
[34:21] different things he said I'm going to
[34:22] show you things let you see it just be
[34:25] very observant and
[34:27] watch because it will
[34:30] be and you know it was very difficult
[34:33] even for in those times because we not
[34:35] were not um you know a registered
[34:39] denomination so it was very difficult
[34:42] for us to get the proper papers the
[34:44] religious you know so we got a lawyer
[34:48] Patty and I did and
[34:50] then um finally we got our religious
[34:54] visa to be able to come here yes
[34:57] but it was um we had been here on like
[35:02] on on yeah it was a visitor's visa yes
[35:05] yes yeah we did yeah mhm so I mean it
[35:09] was legal we were not here
[35:12] illegally you know but anyway so that's
[35:15] what happened and actually later um what
[35:19] happened it was because of the power of
[35:21] the spoken word that we actually God
[35:23] opened up the door and find a and uh it
[35:28] it happened you know it was it was
[35:31] difficult but it it came to pass you
[35:35] know so I'm U God really wanted us here
[35:39] and then um
[35:43] so it was on
[35:46] the uh 6th of okay we came here in May
[35:51] of 93 the 14th of May actually I'll
[35:54] never forget it because that's when
[35:56] Israel you know became a nation you know
[35:58] on that date
[36:00] M also once I was here for about 3
[36:05] weeks I know notice I said Lord are you
[36:09] sure cuz he had told me to come
[36:13] but you know it was it was difficult
[36:16] leaving yes and so at the time I had
[36:20] gone to it was a Saturday afternoon and
[36:22] I had gone to
[36:24] Columbus and I was
[36:28] I was at the time you know nothing
[36:30] nothing was really organized yet or
[36:33] whatever but I was in brother Shell's
[36:35] office there just sitting and I was
[36:37] going to do some typing and I prayed I
[36:41] said Lord are you sure you want me to be
[36:44] here because at this point in time I
[36:46] could still go back and you know and I
[36:50] remember a little Mindy came into the
[36:52] office brother Shel will remember her
[36:55] she was you know he had seen some things
[36:57] about her she was she was really a sweet
[36:59] girl anyway so we T chatted for a little
[37:02] while but everything was new right so
[37:05] the following day following morning so
[37:07] only a few hours had
[37:10] TR
[37:12] transpired and we had the Sunday the
[37:15] June 6th
[37:17] meeting and all of a
[37:20] sudden you know I had just prayed that
[37:23] not talk to anybody okay and uh
[37:27] um during the worship all of a sudden
[37:30] brother shell gets up and he said you
[37:34] wouldn't believe what is happening here
[37:37] right now he said the pillar of fire is
[37:40] moving all over this place like a ball
[37:43] of fire and uh and right
[37:48] now uh I see it in front of simmeron
[37:51] heading for sister
[37:54] Alfreda and uh then it hit me I mean
[37:58] that power that came and and I mean he
[38:02] because he was sitting right behind me
[38:03] Simon
[38:04] was and then I just lost it and the
[38:08] whole Pew you know we all kind of fell
[38:11] like
[38:12] dominoes and he prophesied over me and
[38:15] repeated my
[38:17] prayer I mean that left me speechless as
[38:20] you can imagine he said um you are in
[38:23] the right place you are where God wants
[38:26] you to be and drive your Stakes down do
[38:31] you know I mean it God made business
[38:35] because he wanted me to keep
[38:37] record you know we we had to these
[38:40] things were very important that were're
[38:42] about to come forth for sure so so
[38:46] that's when when um we stayed yeah and
