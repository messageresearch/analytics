TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it's very important in this hour no matter what your goals are no matter what your desires are no matter what your future plans are it is very important in this moment that you first seek the kingdom of God because in that kingdom there is a government that is higher than any form of government that we have come to understand it's even higher than a theocracy because we're thinking about there being a king on the throne but as the message begins to come and unfold and reveal Jesus Christ to us we begin to see that you and I have also a very special calling amen we also have a very special position and a special place to him that overcometh will I grant to him that he would sit with me in my throne if this is really right and I am really born for this if I am really elected and predestinated to this then then I must be I must be I have no choice yet but to be everything that God has called me to be and I've got to figure out any hindrance in my life I've got to figure out whatever it is that's causing me fatigue that's causing me not to be able to press the battle as I have pressed it in the past I got to get my eyes on the goal and the goal it's not heaven the goal its Christ formed in you it is Christ in you the hope of glory that is the goal and therefore we reach the totality of the promise before we go because this is not Christ in you the hope of glory after the rapture in the Millennial Kingdom this is Christ in you the hope of glory we have the mind of Christ we have the mind of Christ this is Christ in you the hope of glory now
