========================================

Description:
This sermon delves into the power of forgiveness, resilience, and faith in God's plan, using Joseph’s journey from betrayal to redemption as a model. It highlights how offense and bitterness can hinder spiritual growth but emphasizes the believer's call to rise above pain. Through Christ, we are empowered to overcome, reject the spirit of offense, and embrace God's greater purpose. Trials are not setbacks but stepping stones to divine fulfillment. Stay steadfast—His strength is made perfect in weakness.

in the earth and it is our connection when we worship you when we raise our hands when we sing praises when we speak praises to you we are abiding we are connecting ourselves to our life Source oh God may we see it not only as a blessing and a privilege but may we catch the responsibility that you have placed on our shoulders as Bridal intercessors it is our responsibility to make sure that the connection between Earth and Heaven is unbroken and that you have full Liberty in the house you enter in through the gate of your children we are the Gates we are the doors and you enter into the Earth through your sons through your bride and so Lord it is a great responsibility that we have as Gatekeepers of planet Earth may we understand that it is not based on how we feel or what we're going through it has nothing to do with our feelings but it is why we were born why we are here it's part of our purpose and we want to take full advantage of who we are as sons of God coming to the place of full adoption you are searching the Earth even now looking for a people that you can place the totality of your Authority in and we practice we practice as Believers using that Authority in our prayer life but Lord we believe there is a time just around the corner where that Authority will be expressed better in declaration in Prophecy in speaking your word that more will be accomplished by speaking your word by declaring and decreeing your word than was ever accomplished by traditional prayer so may we find our place in this hour as your Gates may we lift up our heads and welcome the King of Kings and the Lord of lords from the realm of Eternity into the dimension of time so that you might accomplish so that you might accomplish all that you would come today to accomplish I exalt

watched our president and the prime minister of Israel we we were blessed when the Prime Minister declared once again the lion of the tribe of Judah is roaring over the whole earth he was prophesying of that which he knows not of but there there is a people that heard it and we know what it means it was lifting up Jesus lifting up miach Messiah over the Earth make us sensitive to these days may we

[Applause] musicians I commend you Benjamin for pushing through the distraction this morning that you had to work with I I commend you for not letting it discourage you but running on going on chasing after God I appreciate that it's why we have the Breakthrough moment that we have right now because he didn't give up you didn't give up amen that's how this thing works it's a partnership we're a team in this amen sometimes it feels like we're pulling alone but we're not and uh when we are few in number uh in the in the in the seriousness of the hour We're few in number sometime but when that is the case there is a great band of angels a host of Heaven that are pulling with us and for us and we are compassed about by such a great of cloud of witnesses who without us they have already laid to rest but without us they can never enter into the fullness of their Eternal Destiny they cannot be who God intended for them to be yet the fullness until you and I also finish this race they without us are not complete there's not a bride by by uh age or by or by Dimension or or by time frame there's one bride I know we hear the prophet sometimes differentiating between the Jewish bride and the Gentile bride but scripturally he's doing that to help us understand the difference between uh the dispensation of law instruction and the dispensation of Grace or what we call the church ages but the reality is they are not two Brides uh our God is not into polygamy he has one bride Paul the Apostle saw it in Romans 11 she is neither Jew nor Gentile she has been made one new man both Jew and Gentile one new man is in Christ Jesus the word says He has torn down the middle wall of partition and there is no more separation between Jew or Gentile male or female spiritually in eternity there is no difference there is difference in in time and in the natural Realm of of how we Minister unto the Lord and to each other but when God is getting ready to pour out himself he's not saying wait a minute I got to find a man I got to find a woman I got to I got to find a Jew I've got to find a gentile he said that in the last days he would pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh anybody believe that I know you're standing I I I I know all All Flesh and then he differentiated by relationship he said uh and upon your servants let let me let me pull that somebody give me the verse let me read it because I'm missing what the point I want to make I will pour out my spirit uh upon All Flesh it's in Joel but also in acts right give me just a minute I know you're standing but you'll be seated a while if you find it there it is all right great you're faster than me and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God I will pour out my spirit upon say it with me all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams what's the next verse say and on my servants he said first of all on yours go back and let's look at that on your sons and your daughter they shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams s and on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy there is a clear distinction between your sons and daughters and my servants and handmaidens your sons and daughters is a part of the church ages no doubt about it my servants and my handmaidens is about sons and bride it's a different dimension it's the elect of God and he said your sons and daughters are going to have the same Spirit poured out on them they're going to dream Dreams they're going to see Visions they're going to be mightily used but don't forget that I'm going to pour out my spirit on my servants and my handmade duns I will pour out in the last days of my spirit and they shall do what prophesy there's no indication here that that prophecy will cease in fact Revelation 10 tells us that they will do what they will prophesy again so there's a problem with some somebody's theology that these things are finished there's a great need yet in the Earth for Sons and Daughters to know who they are handmaiden servants to know who they are and to begin to declare that so look what God does he reaches down and uses a prime minister of the Israeli State who studies the Bible he he teaches a Bible study he meets with members of the kasset and has for many many years uh when his dad was alive and even after the death of his father to study the scripture but he doesn't perhaps know that Jesus of Nazareth is Messiah we don't know for sure but it seems that he may not completely know that but he knows that the lion of the tribe of Judah is roaring well there's not two lions there's only one and that lion is the one who stepped forth from the lamb and roared he's still roaring Proverbs chapter 4 I didn't give you this it's from uh uh from our study I want to want to there's so much I want to say but I already have caught the preacher now and I don't want to lose him but uh God bless you all Zion minko has a birthday on Tuesday God bless her and sister Adina uh hammermeister has a birthday sister alfreda's older sister has a birthday on Saturday uh I I believe it's 92 God is good to her has strengthened her and we are thankful for her prayers down through the years make sure that she knows that we are praying for her as well that's brother Bernie for you that don't know that's brother Bernie's mom and she is also the mother of brother Ed hammermeister who's the pastor of the church in Edmonton so may God bless her abundantly we had a wonderful trip I'd like to tell tell you about it maybe I will uh on Tuesday but not now keep thy heart Proverbs 4:23 with all diligence for out of it heart are the issues of life may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated let let's not forget that we have a couple of Series going on inside of each other ultimately the word of the Lord for this year has been Above All Else guard your heart this is where you have the most Authority is over your own heart over your own mind the Bible said let every man be fully persuaded and that means within himself you've got to know that you know that you know amen amen you've got to know that you know that you know you've got to know what you know that's right and you've got to know that you do know and you have alone the authority to search out your heart you can't just trust emotions because they are deceitful they operate uh under whatever influence you're under if you're under the influence of offense your emotions will be be offended if you operate under a a spirit of jealousy your emotions will tend toward uh you know rejection and feeling looked over and left out and all that good stuff so you can't trust your emotions but you have to pray that they come into alignment with what has happened in your regenerated inside of the inside are you with me that's the inner most being some call it the soul the scripture calls it the spirit doesn't matter what you call it as long as you understand how it functions when Jesus comes in he doesn't come to save your emotions he comes to to take your Fallen human Spirit it fell under Adam's authority to take your Fallen human Spirit to infuse it or baptize it with his own life with his own Holy Spirit and you take anything dead Fallen broken ruined and plunge it under the life of God the blood of Jesus as sister was singing what happens to death death has to go and that reproducible Resurrection breaks forth in your once Fallen spirit and now you rise up in a new spirit and the Bible said that life that you once lived by that unction that once moved you through life it's not moving you through life anymore you're now moving through life with another kind of Life a regenerated Spirit one that has been born a new one that has been born from Heaven are you with me and that's so powerful because nothing can bring your innermost part Soul or spirit whichever you prefer to call it nothing can bring that down it has been resurrected it should be the control tower the prophet tells us that the nature of the spirit is the soul and that's why people often put it in that other order but what you what you need to understand is uh the nature of something is how it moves how it behaves how it manifests and therefore you turn that thing around and you want to know who you really are you really are what's coming out of your soul now that's in this realm in the spirit realm that innermost being it is just like Jesus you are already seated together with Christ in Heavenly places but if you're not living out of that if it has not taken charge over your soul life mind will and emotions then you'll live out of the soul and if you live out of the Soul you're going to be fickle and that means you may be spiritual one moment and carnal another the Bible said that makes a double-minded man glance this look this way every now and again uh that makes a double-minded man and the Bible said a double-minded man is UN a can't trust him he talks one minute out of his soul he talks one minute out of his Spirit you don't ever know which man you got he's unstable he he's mentally imbalanced because he is living out of both parts of the inner being in Judaism there's only one part uh of the Inner Man and they teach that that is Soul and Spirit functioning together and that is how God wants it to be he wants our soul to be under the control of that regenerated Spirit which is the life of Jesus Christ and you know this you've heard it but we forget it sometime our responsibility is not in that innermost part the spirit our responsibility is in the soul life because what God has done in the spirit is done and what is happening now is redemption and salvation is taking place in the Middle Ground praise God praise God you're being saved you're being redeemed mind will and emotions and when you come to the to the totality or the entirety of that guess what you're you have full adoption and your name on the check you know what it says you know how it is you've got the authority of all of Heaven back in you up and so one of these days you're going to have total redemption in the third part of who you are that's the body of Flesh it's coming you're going to lay this body down and you're going to pick up another one you see the body that you live in now is not your original body this isn't the original one God already made you a body yes sir it's on the other side it's in the other realm waiting on you that's what he said this body is second body this is Fallen body one of these days you're going to lay this thing you're going to shed it like a shell like a snail out of his shell you're just going to shed it Hallelujah and you're going to step into that Spirit body that was created for you one day I'm going to take a step right into that body there are times in the goodness of God that we actually feel a pull from that body isn't that interesting to know it pulls on us and if you're sensitive to it you need to become sensitive to the fact that you have representation in both Realms you're represented in Physical Realm of time in a body like this a flesh you live in but you're also represented in eternity where there is no time with a spirit body isn't that interesting and that body over there has the ability to pull you to pull on you to tug at you praise God it has the ability to call out to you isn't that interesting brother Ram said have you heard from your theophany well I have I've heard from mine he's getting ready for me to come and occupy it is't that interesting it is so that is more real than what we are walking around in right now it's a reality not a fantasy not a fairy tale it's a reality well I'm just down I'm just down and I'm just I'm just I'm just heavy and I'm just down well you don't have to stay there such is common to man to get down but if you spend 24 hours in that realm you're living below your means as an overcoming Christian get right back up what if I wake up the next morning feel down fight your way out of the paper bag look this way get off your phone get off your phone and listen to me this morning you might get a hold of something that'll help you to win this race I want you to look again quickly at Matthew 24 verse 10-13 we've looked at that this is Jesus talking so we're we're uh in a series Above All Else guard your heart we are in a sub series of Above All Else guard your heart that I would call a comprehensive teaching on the spirit of offense and this morning we're going to spend a little bit of time with Joseph and his brothers we spent some time with a with Cain and Abel and we didn't finish with them but we we have moved on my fear is that you'll lose all interest in this if we stay too long but but uh let me just say there there's a lot more that we could have uh talked about biblically with Cain and Abel but we'll just Ease on because we want to get to something pretty Nitty Gritty as soon as possible Jesus says in Matthew 24:10 and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another so offense and betrayal is a part of the end time Jesus said it it it's going to happen you're going to get offended offense is going to come trouble's going to come hard times are going to come but don't you be the one who does it to somebody else keep your mind clear your heart clean your hands sanctified purified amen many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall what wax cold the stronghold of cold love there wouldn't be a problem with cold love if there wasn't so much iniquity and compromise around that's what paralyzes and freezes out our love verse 13 but he but he or she that shall endure unto the end the same shall be delivered shall be saved shall be redeemed shall be caught away uh Luke 17 And1 in the Amplified said and Jesus said to the disciples Temptations SN snares traps set to entice to sin are sure to come but woe to him by or through whom they come that word offended that is in both Matthew and in the King James version of Luke 171 uh it is that word scandalo uh in Greek and it means to put put a snare in the way caused to stumble or be led to sin it means to set a trap and to catch somebody in offense it's the devil's job it's his it's his desire to paralyze you with hurt feelings he wants to do that remember he can't do anything about your redeemed regenerated Spirit he can't unsave you unredeem you unelect you un predestinate you unjustify you he can't do anything about what's already done but what he will do is he will mess around in the middle ground trying to get you offended about everything and if you don't believe it's the spirit of the age you you just got to read the paper this is cancell culture we're living in right now and and and everybody's got to be careful what they say and it don't do anybody good if they've got any influence out there to say anything because by Monday morning they'll be apologizing for it they don't have a choice because they'll be unfriended unfollowed unsupported nobody will buy their music and so they've got to say well I you know I'm so don't get excited when you hear somebody saying something because if they desire to remain popular if that's their ambition if they've got an Elvis Presley Spirit then they're going to just have to come right back and apologize so uh because somebody is going to be offended and uh they're offended about this offended about that some people are offended that the church will not endorse their lifestyle we can love you as an individual we can pray for you as an individual but we can't endorse sin you don't want us to say it's all right when the word says it's not all right do you so people get so offended by those things because again we want an automatic relationship we don't want to have to pay anything for it don't want to have to give anything up we're living in an hour where everybody wants to do what's right in their own eyes they don't want have to explain it to anybody don't want to answer to anybody are you with me that's where we are but you know we got to get away from that as Believers just let the world roll on I sung from the time I was a child the old song that said I'll stand for Jesus and let the world go by we better do that we better stand for Jesus and let the world go by I don't care who wins the Super Bowl don't matter tomorrow it won't matter by midnight it'll be over Pro I don't know about the times but it'll be over and and it'll be what it is and somebody will be excited and somebody will be dejected somebody will call in work tomorrow cuz their team lost oh I'll stand for Jesus let the crazy foolish world just go by who cares what they do somebody said you don't want to know the score sure I I'll I'll listen to the score the only one only reason why I would even care is I'm a little I'm a little intrigued by the the names of the teams you really can't lose because Chief has a very prophetic significance through the through through the word and so does Eagles other than that it don't matter all I care about his standing for Jesus let the world Roll by I didn't vote for who Taylor Swift recommended could care less don't even know what she looks like if you showed me a picture I'm might call her Miley Cyrus or something I might not even know what she looks like don't really care I'm going to stand for Jesus and let the world go by we have to cuz many are going to fall under scandalo they're going to take the bait oh and wear the mask that's the hour we're living in so there's many examples in scripture of What offense can do and we know that offense from the very beginning can be so strong that it drives somebody to hatred bitterness first resentment comparison leads to resentment resentment leads to bitterness bitterness leads to malice which is a high degree of hatred and the next thing you know Murder is is the next step it might be with a gun it might be with hateful words we're going to be responsible regardless Let the church say Amen am so we're going to have to deal with some things the Bible teaches that Believers will have various kinds of problems here on Earth if anybody told you that the Christian Life is a bed of ease they lied but if anybody told you it's harder to be a Christian than a sinner they lied the Bible said the way of the transgressor is hard there are difficulties in the Christian life but we've got somebody on board John Jesus said in John 16:33 red letter these things I have spoken unto you that in Me In Me In Me you might have peace peace where is our peace found not in the weekly paycheck not in our political party not in our president not in our Hobbies not in our our habits our peace real peace real shalom shalom shalom completed peace is only found one place in him that's where love is that's where peace is it's in him these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world in the world in the world you shall have tribulation you're expecting an easy ride in the world don't you're going to live in this world you're going to have tribulation s or sinner but be of good cheer if you're a Believer because I Jesus talking red letter I have overcome World hello church I have overcome the world so all you need to do to find your peace is get in me stay in me he said it's not enough to connect with him because our feet gets slippery on its foundation and that which we have heard has a tendency to go Drifting by us as we preached last Sunday we let truth go by us without identifying with it so it's out there in the atmosphere but it's not in here where it needs to be don't you dare let it slip don't you dare let it uh float by you in the Stream of Life grab a hold of it it's your life preserver somebody ought to say amen truth truth is is not Doctrine truth is a person the person is made up of Doctrine he's made up of everything good everything perfect everything holy but he's a person he's not a church he's not a prophet truth is not I believe serpent seed that is a truth I'm not talking about a truth I'm talking about clinging to the truth he's a person omniscient omnipresent omnipotent he's a person Jesus said I am I am the resurrection I am the life I am the bread I am the water he's saying I'm everything you need and more stay in me abide in me it's not automatic you got to swim you're not a jellyfish you're a salmon use your backbone use your shoulder amen we have to as Believers throw your shoulder in this put your backbone in this and push pray until something happens push p u h pray until something happens push don't float Don't Drift push these things are going to come he said but in me you're going to have peace in the world you're going to have tribulation but be of good cheer I've overcome the world some of these trials will be regular problems that are common to all of human the whole Human family has problems tribulations trials Sorrows heraches losses griefs but some of them are specific to the believer Matthew 5:45 that ye may be the children red letter that you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on The Good the sun got up this morning come up over the horizon and God's people needed it benefited from it and so did the evil Wicked hearted man the sun is God's gift to all of us it rises and sets on the good on the evil on the righteous and the unrighteous and he sendeth rain on the just we could say on the Justified and the unjust the unjustified the redeemed and the unredeemed the believer and the non-believer sun warms us up Rain sends us what we need for future Harvest uh it's not just the the believer's crop that benefits from the rain your a a his neighbor his Tomatoes drink it in too it's the plan of God common to man but some things are not just common to all men and to the Human family at large some things are targeted to the believer and that's why we're told in First Peter 5:8 be sober don't be drunk with your emotions don't be drunk with your situation don't be drunk with your C circumstance if your family is haywire don't you be Haywire if your job is chaotic don't you be chaotic if your friends are wishy-washy don't you be wishy-washy you be sober don't be drunk don't be giddy don't be sloppy that's right you know how drunk people are be sober be serious there's a time to laugh there's a time not to laugh there's a time to be to have fun to enjoy life to eat and enjoy the fruit of our labor as a gift of God there's a time to refrain from eating there's a time to refrain from partying from celebrating there's a time to be serious amen there's a time to eat cake and there's a time not to eat cake you've got to know the difference be so sober and don't be LAX about it be what Vigilant we broke that down for you many times no need to do it again because your adversary at all sist that old attorney because that adversary word there is a word that's used in legal terminology to represent the the accuser your accuser your ad adversary the devil he is both sober and Vigilant and he's not a Believer he is as a roaring line which means he's got more noise than power but he don't stand still he's creative he's not stationary he's moving all about in your business I'm preaching he's in your stuff he heard what you said he heard what you said and he's all in your stuff and he's got plenty to say about it he's a roaring line lot of noise lot of hot air always on the Move seeking whom remember that doesn't mean who he can take a bite out of who he can trip up who he can hinder it means who he can eat up consume if we really took this at face value which we won't always do because some people couldn't handle the reality of what the verse says it would be too too UNC it would be too too common it would be too uh off color or whatever you like to call it but if we took this verse in its original language and we took it to the fullest of the meaning of the root do you know what we'd be saying we'd be saying the enemy wants to eat you digest you oh you all are trying to help me when I think of expel I'm thinking out of the mouth that's not what is being said digest you and oh you people are so clean and holy poop he wants to turn you into something that's vile he wants your testimony to stink uhoh uhoh uhoh am I going to get Flack he wants to make your testimony stink he wants to make your reputation in Christ stink he wants to eat you up and not spit you out but to so devour you there's nothing left if there's any good in you he'd like to get a hold of that and leave you just waste like the Apostle said dung that's what he desires to do but I've got news for him I'm not going to be still long enough for him to eat me I'm going to keep moving too and I'm going to learn eventually that I don't have to run from him because it's just a roar I'm running from what I have to really do is show him my [Music] badge I may look like Barney F to you devil but this badge says I have the authority that I need to stop you in your tracks I'm a Believer I'm a blood bought Son of God I'm Sanctified by the washing of the water of the word I've been filled with the Holy Ghost and Fire and I don't have to run from you and one of these days I'm going to dance on your lid a thousand years you're going to toss and Tumble and I'm going to take my turn on the lid of the Abyss on the lid of of the bottomless pit it's true devil you're going to be loose for a short time at the end of that thousand years and given a second swat at the Nations but what you don't know is that after a thousand years of King Jesus somebody'd be a fool to choose your rotten ways why do you think that the nations of the world are exposed to King Jesus for a thousand years here would you go back to being a republican after the Millennium W that's good preaching would you go back to being you know some Shriner some you know identify yourself with some group or organization after living under the authority and reign of King Jesus for a thousand years where the lion lays down next to the lamb and the little baby plays on the hole of the ass and a little child leads the Beast of the wild because of King Jesus on the throne and then you're going to go let that little devil that's been trapped up for a thousand years running around like a little uh pointed eared Mouse uh coming out of that pit you're you're going to follow him you you're going to deceive him oh you don't understand what a thousand years of peace and the reign of King Jesus is going to do to this whole earth so yeah you can you can have your little spell but I need to tell you right now it's not going to do much good because by then this bride will have all the authority she needs she'll know who she is some of some of us will already be coming back riding on horses with King Jesus and the rest of us will be raised up Immortal be sober be vigilant because your adversary of the Devils is a roaring life walketh about seeking whom he may devour you see the problem is there are some problems let me let me restate this there are some problems that the whole world experiences and some blessings and benefits there are certain difficulties and situations and trials that only Believers face and here is the reality of the believer you don't mind as much when you recognize hell is persecuting you you don't mind as much when you realize your enemies are against you are you with me you don't mind this much when the world doesn't want anything to do with you because what Fellowship ha light with Darkness but where the believer is often trapped it's when the hurt when the trial comes from a breath a brother when it comes from the Brethren betrayal is even more difficult when it comes from from Friends enemies you can expect they hate you they want to see you destroyed but when friends want to sabotage your life when other Christians want to stop you oh let's preach a while when other believers uh uh have you for dinner not not literally it's hard David said in Psalm 55 let's go there 12 through 14 he said for it was not an enemy that reproached me then I could have borne it neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me then I would have hid myself from him but it was thou a man mine equal my guide and my acquaintance my father-in-law my king he could have said but it was thou a man mine equal my guide and mine acquaintance we took sweet counsel together shared our our hearts with one another bore our sorrows to one another exposed ourselves transparently to one another and we walked unto the house of God together in company had it been my [Music] enemy I would have bounced back by now had it been a Democrat I'd be laughing by now but it was you it was you it was my friend it was my brother it was you that uh we shared sweet Fellowship coffee together and bore our interests our desires our dreams our Visions our our our goals and our fears our weaknesses our vulnerabilities and because it was you I'm having a lot harder time bouncing back this is what the psalmist David was saying and if there are any believers here that have ever found woundedness at the hand of another believer you know that it is particularly vile and sharp and painful and and it is a pain that doesn't just e away as quickly as you would like for it to it's something that you nurse and something that you somehow hold on to and if you're not aware that it's crippling your feet if you're not aware that it's handicapping you you may stay in that offense indefinitely but once you get a good look in the mirror once you see that you're not walking like you once walked you're not talking like you once talked you're not overcoming like you once overcame you then need to do something about that woundedness you need to do something about that offense some people believe that they've had a particularly hard week so they deserve three pieces of cake instead of one a dozen Crispy Cream instead of one I use food because I understand it I understand how it can become uh our vice our crutch but it's any it's any VI it's any sin it's anything it's any Indulgence we keep telling ourselves I deserve a break from church because I've been uh I've been to church every Tuesday night for a year so if I lay out a few weeks shouldn't make any difference to anybody it doesn't matter what situation you're in we somehow convince ourselves that it's okay to be that way it's okay to stay that way it's okay to feel that way it's called self-justification it's a characteristic of the spirit of offense if you're around somebody always justifying themselves always excusing them themselves always shifting blame you need to know and we're going to break that down very comprehensively in a week or so a week or so I've spent many hours not only finding the characteristics of the spirit of offense but identifying the spirits that run with it because something you need to understand is that there are families so to speak this is just a analogy to help you there are often families of spirits that run together joining hand in hand strengthening one another for instance you may be under the influence of a of a of an offended Spirit a spirit of offense you might find yourself being angry that's that's because anger is one of the spirits that runs with offense you might find bitterness because bitterness is a spirit that often runs in tandem with a fence we will cover that so extensively until you'll pray to God we can move on to something else I'm sure of it betrayal is tough when it comes from brothers friends family asked Joseph Joseph was soow by his Brethren betrayed by his own family blood blood family no halves no steps blood family serious if you look at these Patriarchs I shouldn't have said halves I should have said uh steps all blood related and yet Joseph is a nearly perfect type of the Lord Jesus Christ beautiful have you ever looked at the characteristics similarities commonalities between Jesus and Joseph well I want to help you with them quickly this morning we don't have a lot of time to spend here but I want to give you a few of them so you'll understand just how important this betrayal was in the life of Joseph Joseph was beloved by his father Jacob just as Jesus was beloved and declared of the father to be his beloved Son both of them beloved special sons look at it with me beloved Sons Joseph Genesis 373 now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children he had a favorite because he was the son of his old age he was proud you've got to understand the the the whole patriarchal system of that Eastern culture he was proud that at his old age he could still father a son so Joseph the late baby became one of the favorites he wasn't the last but he was one of the most favorites because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors just asked Dolly pardon she sung about it look at Jesus Matthew 3:17 and lo a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased so both Joseph and Jesus were identified in scriptures as being beloved sons of their fathers number two both were sent by their fathers on missions Joseph to check on his brothers Jesus to seek and to save lost Humanity look at Genesis 3713 and Israel said unto Joseph do not thy Brethren feed the flock in sheam come and I will send thee unto them Jesus in John 3:17 for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved both beloved Sons Joseph and Jesus both beloved Sons sent commissioned with a purpose by their fathers do you see that both were rejected number three by their own people Joseph by his brothers who sold him into slavery Jesus by the Jewish leaders his own people who handed him over to be crucified so they both experienced both Joseph and Jesus rejection by their Brethren Joseph in Genesis 37:18 and when they saw him AAR off even before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay him not his enemies his brothers Blood Brothers somebody say Blood Brothers Blood Brothers Blood Brothers same father Blood Brothers and Jesus in John 1:1 he came unto his own just like Joseph and his own received him not number four they were both sold for silver Joseph in Genesis 3728 then there uh there passed by lifted him out of the pit sold him to the midianite merchantmen lifted him out of the pit and sold Joseph to the Israelites for 20 pieces of silver Jesus sold by his own Matthew 26:15 and said unto them what will you give me and I will deliver him unto you and they covenanted with him for 30 pieces of silver somebody said that's not a real type it is a real type it was it was silver they both were sold we don't have that many biblical instance instances of someone being sold particularly by silver you could look at that and understand why maybe another time but not not now but somebody said well Jesus got got a little more for Jesus than it did for Joseph Ju Just think about the value only only 10 pieces the savior of the world has come and and uh although the the value of the silver had likely gone up between the two men's lives only 30 pieces of silver sold our Lord to his death could God have stopped it why didn't he you really know that do you understand that by Revelation you stood between him and and his father stopping the whole thing the old song he could have called 10,000 angels to loose the nails set him free he could have set the whole world on fire but he died alone the song writer said for you and me number five Joseph's path to Glory came through suffering and humiliation he was falsely accused imprisoned But ultimately Rose to become second only to Pharaoh in Egypt similarly Jesus endured false accusations death on the cross but was then resurrected and exalted to the right hand of power and authority Joseph in Genesis 39:20 and Joseph's Master took him put him into prison a place where the king's prisoners were bound and he was there in the prison and Jesus in Isaiah it talks about 538 for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken powerful and as we mentioned the exaltation after the suffering Joseph in Genesis 41:41 and Pharaoh said unto Joseph see I have set thee over all the land of Egypt Jesus in Philippians 2:9 wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name do we really have to go through all this we really do we really do because this is what study in the Bible looks like and it's important to do it I don't think we would have faed near the distraction this morning that we faced in trying to break through into worship if more of us would have been engaging him Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday we may not realize this in fact you may get offended oh how could anybody get offended during a series on a fence you might even get offended when I tell you but it matters when you walk out of here on a Sunday afternoon and you don't ever mention him again on a week when we don't have a Tuesday night service you don't ever engage his word again you don't ever open your Bible or open your app phone app with a Bible and read a verse or two make a devotion read a devotion pray a devotion ask yourself some questions about your own life take a moment to worship turn on a worship song lift your hands right at the sink right in the backyard yes sir oh Jesus you're worthy I don't want to be offensive but that's what believers do if you're not taking that opportunity you're not living like a Believer I want to tell you something if you're not taking that opportunity you're not living like a Believer no wonder we come together so distracted fussing and fuming all the way to church and then expect the song leader to pull us into the presence of God no throw your shoulder into it push how many of you found it worth it when you do when you adjust your own attitude listen when you adjust your own attitude you make my job easier I don't have to adjust it for you you come in here just adjust your attitude and say look I don't have time to be thinking about all my troubles and trials worries and betrayals I've come to lift up the King of Kings and the Lord of lords what about a Monday what about a Tuesday what about a Tuesday when there's no church listen folks if we will engage him in some way by faith every day brother brandom says a True Believer reads his Bible every day and praise this give me give me give me count I don't really think so because God is not a Buddha he's not a lucky charm he doesn't want to just be asked for something he wants to be adored he wants to be reverenced he wants to be worshiped he wants to be loved he wants you to turn off Netflix and spend a moment or two with him he wants you to get off YouTube and spend some time with him how long has it been since you've heard a message by Brother brandom somebody said they're too long you ought to be used to that by now listen 20 minutes at a time you got a smartphone don't be a dummy with your smartphone use it smartly put it on the counter got to brush your teeth got to comb your hair please comb your hair Ben please comb your hair Jonathan please comb your hair everybody's got to comb their hair when they get ready to go out you you're not some what what mama would have called a woolly booger that's probably not a nice term but we just said it anyway uh you're representing the king of the king of kings and the Lord of lords put a little deodorant on and wash your face get the cracklings out of your eyes represent Jesus to a world that's lost come on make up your mind to make up your mind to make up your mind to serve him with everything that you've got don't miss your opportunity he's as close as the mention of his name amen so they both suffered some stuff but they had exaltation they were lifted up Joseph in Genesis 4141 uh we covered that and we covered Philippians 2 wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name let you and I be actively involved in Philippians 2:9 every day lifting him up highly exalting him in Praise when people come and they lay the trap don't take the bait give him praise instead somebody come to you and give you the dirt the dump on somebody else you just say well here's the reality of it they're probably just just like me not what I want to be not what I ought to be but not what I used to be let's pray for him and give him a little Grace what if you did that what if you didn't take the cheese what if you refused the bait what if you just kept your mouth shut would it be so hard wouldn't it be worth it to hold the victory for more than 24 hours at a time wouldn't it be worth it to be less distracted in life because every time we entertain the bait of offense or we get involved in somebody else's beeswax every time we do that that was for Billy somebody tell him what I said I included him every time we get involved in somebody else's beeswax we are missing our opportunity to shine number seven both did you hear me I plugged you both became Sur saviors of their people Joseph saved many from famine storing up grain while Jesus offers spiritual salvation from sin Joseph in Genesis 45:7 and God sent me before you to prepare you a posterity in the earth and to save your life lives by great Deliverance who is he talking to his brothers that's who he was talking to his own the ones that the ones that tried to kill him throw him in a pit killed an animal took that coat of many colors dipped it in the blood of an animal took it back to his father and said oh Father wild beast have t your favorite son apart lies he lay rotting in a pit somebody had compassion let's sell him to the to the traveling Merchants uh you know whatever bit of that was God's Sovereign will and plan he used the Betrayal of his brothers to put him closer to where he wanted him to be so that Deliverance great help me great Deliverance it's going to come to your lives my brothers and your children and your children's children and your children's children one of those brother's name was yehudah Juda Judah could have starved to death had it not been for yourself had it not been for his brother Judah would have died there's a problem with that it's from the loins of Judah that Jesus came Judah was a son Jesus was a son of Judah had he died Not only would salvation have not come to all the children of Jacob but Salvation wouldn't have come to you and I somebody said you can't look at it that way that's exactly how you have to look at it well couldn't have God raise somebody else up he could have but he already had a plan through Judah so God preserved his life and guess what he used a Brother Joseph who could have been offended who could have been bitter who could have wanted Vengeance who could have wanted to take revenge who could have killed them all and been Justified even under the law for doing so but he chose rather to take God's perspective and God's perspective said I got a plan in all of this I haven't left you Joseph I'm taking you from the pit to the Palace I've got a plan I've got a plan for your life it hurts you're bleeding on the inside the Betrayal feels more than you can bear the Bible doesn't talk to us much about the time that Joseph spent been in the pit but it wasn't a party or it was I'm sure there were days of pity party you ever had one don't you look at me like you've never had a pity party some of you been in one a whole week some of you came in here today with a big old pity party some old sad look on your face wanting somebody to ask you what was wrong I'm not I am not going to play your game my responsibility is not to be your buddy God didn't call me to be your buddy I don't have any he didn't call me to be your buddy he didn't call me to treat you or to look at you like a friend he called me to train you that's that's what he said 50 years ago when he called me to this work to train you because you got something to do and you don't always train with a carrot thank God for every carrot he's ever given me to keep me moving along but it wasn't the carrot that brought me to my knees it was the staff it was the rod it was the Whip and you don't even despise the rod when you understand its purpose when you understand that to be trained means means to be told and then an example set before you that you can follow that's what training looks like so I have to practice this when I don't feel like when I don't wna it's my responsibility to wna you got to make yourself W sometime for somebody else as we have talked about before we come in here we're not Hypocrites we don't come in here to put something on we come in here not to reflect feelings pain or struggles or trials I didn't come in here with a blue face so you'd ask me what my problem was I came in here ready to lift up the Lord because it doesn't matter what my problem is and it doesn't matter what your problem is if Jesus is Lord he can handle them all he can take care of it all he can heal every pain he can soothe every heartache he can speak peace to the chaos rest to the stress there are certain personalities of people we have quite a few around here who aren't happy if somebody doesn't share their level of stress you've got to understand that just because you're a basket case it's no indication that anybody else needs to be one to make you feel better you don't need somebody to follow you down the road of chaos you need somebody solid you need somebody who will tell you the same thing every time you talk to them look up Jesus is Lord he'll get you through he'll make a way where there is no way you shouldn't be compassionate sure we should that's not what I'm saying sure we should be compassionate but some people feed off of sympathy which is a characteristic of an offended Spirit sometimes what we think we want or deserve is not what we need at all sometimes we need somebody to look us right in the eye and say suck it up buttercup get up just get up and press on oh I love the looks and the feelings all that gets stirred when you preach a little message like this I know Jesus wasn't that way he wasn't I've prayed for you Peter Satan has desired to sift you his wheat but I've prayed for you that don't sound I I know I know I know how you think he said it oh come here Pete Peter Peter Peter Peter it's going to be all right I don't believe that was he tender he was was he kind he was was he loving he was was he compassionate he was but he understood that he was there to train those disciples cuz he was leaving do you understand the pressure that he carried I'm out of here my my time didn't he try to tell them my time is getting short fellas Fellers my time is getting short I'm about to leave here if you're going to make anything out of yourselves you better do it now cuz I'm sending you out like Lambs Among Wolves you run from the enemy and you'll become dinner you know who you are you'll stand up in the faith Hallelujah woo don't you realize that's what made Peter transformed it took him a reed that was blown around in the wind and made him a solid rock revealed a revelation to him that the whole Church of Jesus Christ is built on the betrayer became the foundation that the church is built on the one who denied the denier became the reflection he stopped trusting in his biceps and started trusting in his savior I prayed for you Peter it's going to be rough when you see who you are Satan has desired to sift you as weed yes but you're predestinated elected and bride you don't have anything to worry about is that what he said no he said when you get saved when you become a new creature when thou art converted when you get what you've been talking about when you become what you confess don't for forget the rest of the folks when thou art converted strengthen the brothers show them how show them give your testimony tell them how weak you were tell them how how blown around you were tell them how you denied wear it don't deny it but don't you stop there Peter you go on make sure you tell them that it wasn't John who laid his head on the breast of the Lord it wasn't James who went to Death By The Sword it wasn't Matthew or Mark or Luke The Physician it was you that got the Revelation you are not just Jesus Son of Joseph abiding in Nazareth but you are the anointed one the mesiah the Messiah you are the son of the Living God I've told you hundreds of times that wasn't church doctrine nobody in the synagogue was preaching that God had a son there's prophetic indication in the in the prophets of the Old Testament Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel and maybe a few others that God was going to come in another form perhaps even as a son but by the time the second temple period came nobody was teaching preaching or believing that Messiah was going to be deity or that he was going to be a son of the Living God a powerful godsent military General who would deliver the Jewish people out of uh Roman occupation driving back the apostasy of the Greeks and making PE for Jerusalem all of that they believed that's what Peter would have been taught that's what he would have heard Shabbat after Shabbat so it wasn't his Pastor his Rabbi it wasn't his parents it was somehow in prayer in meditation in giving of himself before the Lord that a that a truth dropped into his heart bypassing his head and he said I know who you are you're the son of the Living God you're God in human flesh blessed are you Simon for Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it don't ever forget that's the same Peter that the little dishwashing woman said you've got to be one of them what don't know what you're talking about here come another three times before the crowed once Peter had already denied the Lord Thrice three times all the Common People isn't that amazing people that didn't really matter in the economy of influence but Peter in that moment couldn't stand the thought that somebody would think he was identified with him because it would mean his sudden death and death did come to Peter he was martyred he he certainly suffered and was willing to pay the price in that moment because Revelation had preceded it had it had taken preeminence or prominence over his shiftiness and now he was a rock and now he could stand for Christ and now he didn't care what anybody thought not even the Dig Aries and leaders I am I am him you ever heard of that Jesus of Nazareth I'm one of his I belong to him I am him that's what identification means it doesn't just mean I'm acquainted with him it means I am him whatever you would do to him do it to me CU I'm identified with him Joseph and Jesus saviors of their people have a few more minutes not many but a few when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers he showed forgiveness and mercy just as Jesus offers forgiveness to those who rejected him Joseph in Genesis 455 now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me [Laughter] hither don't worry fellas can you imagine for God God did send me God I thought it was midianite Merchants Joseph didn't mention the pit he didn't mention the 20 uh pieces of silver he didn't mention the medanite traders who traded him again before he got to Egypt he said for God did send me before you to preserve life you tried to take mine and God sent me ahead to preserve yours talk about eating Humble Pie they ate because of Joseph their children ate because of Joseph ain't that beautiful that's why he had such a beautiful spirit he took God's perspective in Jesus same way in Luke 23:34 then said Jesus father forgive them they're not just calling him bad names they're not just making fun of him they're not just inviting him to the bonfire they're crucifying him they're plucking out his beard spitting on his face when he said I'm thirsty they didn't give him water not not blue bottle or otherwise they took some hispin which is a plant that grows wild and rough in the Holy Land tied it onto a a pole staff and dipped that thing in vinegar and held it up to his mouth has anybody in here ever thought you sure like to have a big Swig of V when you were thirsty it only brought a burn to his lips parched you ever had chap lips come in contact with something with any acid in it you got really cha lips air can hurt it can't it but here's vinegar on an old rough piece of Sage Brush like touched it to his lips there was no there was no uh soothing in that there was no no Comfort a Roman soldier decided to make sure he was out of his misery and took a spear and ran it through his side and blood and water flowed and and Jesus is praying father forgive them Joseph is saying don't worry Brothers I forgive you God used you he got me here to help you and Jesus is hanging there saying father forgive them for they don't even know what they're doing they don't even know they're serving the higher purposes of the kingdom of God they don't even know that in their wickedness with their selfish intent they are still in the hand of my papa and he is using them to save the world to save the world there's also a parallel in how Jesus and Joseph's circumstances were used by God to bring about good as Joseph told his brothers I love this verse Joseph took God's perspective in Genesis 50:20 stay with me a few more minutes but as for you ye thought evil against me you minute for my destruction but God meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive powerful and Jesus in Acts 2:23 him being delivered by the determinate counsel and for knowledge of God ye have taken and by Wicked hands have crucified and slain the Apostle wanted them to know you did the dirty deed but you only did it because it was the will and the forn knowledge of God or you could have never done it Jesus told him no man takes my life if I die in front of your eyes it's because I laid down my life in front of you you need to know powerful isn't it and then last there are many others I just chose 10 Joseph's emotional reunion with his brothers where he Embraces them and speaks kindly Words of Life to them you can find that in Genesis 45: 14 and 15 it mirrors how Christ lovingly received those who come to him no longer calling us servants but friends as in John 15:15 but this speaks of the reconciliation with his Brethren Genesis 454 and Joseph said unto them come near to me I pray you and they came near and he said hey I'm Joseph your brother remember me I'm the one you sold into slavery I'm the one you throw it in the pit and left to die but don't worry all is well in Jesus Ephesians 2:18 says for through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the father reconciliation with their Brethren that that both is speaking about that one new man that we were talking about a little while ago because of his sacrifice we're no longer divided by a wall of partition brother brandham makes reference to this typology in the life of of Joseph and let me give you that and we'll close in the message God's only provided place of worship shf Port I'm only mentioning this because it comes to mind Jonathan's dad and Grandparents were there during this series of meetings in shreport and upon this com Stone upon Stone in each age to vindicate that word that's coming up just exactly as Jesus did in his age which is the Capstone of it all in him laid every age oh my that doesn't sound like an eighth grade education in him Jesus laid every age in Jesus was Moses in Jesus was David and Jesus was the prophets and he said is that right in those little Pentecostals didn't know what to say yeah yeah I guess so he said look at Joseph sold for almost 30 pieces of silver throw it in supposed to be dead taken out went and come to the right hand of pharaoh look exactly Jesus was Joseph was in Jesus powerful where do you think you are you better be you better be and then uh one more place in a masterpiece of a message called the Masterpiece paragraph 61 one brother Bram said now watch every Masterpiece is put on a foundation a sculpture Angelo he's speaking of Michelangelo Angelo's Monument of Moses is on a three or four foot piece of marble it's got a foundation some of us have been there some of us have seen these statues that Michelangelo created including the Pata and which is the mother of Jesus holding him his broken dead body in her arms and his amazing painting in the cine Chapel I've seen it with my own eyes it leaves some kind of a an effect on your on your an imprint on your life brother brandham said so God in preparing this masterpiece he put it on a foundation of the Patriarchs now typically in scripture the Patriarchs are the 12 sons of Jacob it can also mean Abraham and Isaac and other fathers but in the book of Acts when the Patriarchs are referred to it's specifically speaking concerning the brothers of Joseph Joseph and his brothers he said and the patriarch Foundation First was Abraham then Isaac then Jacob then Joseph he said that makes the four corners and now Abraham was on the foundation of Faith let's say it had four foundations the foundation of Faith was Abraham the foundation of love was Isaac the foundation of Grace was Jacob God's grace to Jacob anyone knows that but in Joseph woo let's go back and catch that Faith was Abraham love the foundation of love with Isaac the foundation of Grace Jacob but in Joseph Grace but in Joseph was Perfection there is where he could set the monument upon not the First Foundation second third but on the fourth Foundation Perfection that means to us that Joseph was a perfect type of Jesus and that in Jesus Joseph was represented Abraham portrayed Christ of course so did Isaac in love Abraham did in faith Isaac didn't in love Jacob did by his grace because Jacob means deceiver or supplanter and that's what he was but God's grace God's grace was with him he had to do what he did there was a purpose in all of that business amen but when it comes to Joseph there's not nothing against him just one little scratch for the foundation must also be a masterpiece when he told his father the prophet say to say to Pharaoh your people are cattle raisers and not Shepherds because a Shepherd is an Abomination to the Egyptians I hardly think that was a sin but brother brand is pointing out this one small differentiation to help you to see but when the old prophet got before Pharaoh he said your servants are herdsmen so it scratched it see that's why it still makes it the Masterpiece Joseph the life of Joseph the foundation of perfection beautiful perfect type of our Lord he said now the foundation is laid through faith love Grace let us go on I was waiting on you to help me now you must be worn out let us go on unto not laying again some preachers all they can preach is baptism in jesus' name nothing could be more important than that but we must get it do it tell others to do it and move on now the foundation is laid through faith love Grace and to Perfection through the Patriarchs last paragraph now the body work that come on this Great Masterpiece was the prophets Patriarchs then the prophets the scripture says that the Church of Jesus Christ is built on the foundation of Apostles and Prophets he said I hope hope you can read it the prophets not the laws the prophets for the prophets with a with a s plural notice was the Vindicated word which makes the body not the Patriarchs the prophets they were the word and that includes Jesus Jus Christ who was both Prophet priest and King so this is this life of Joseph uh we are on page eight of about 12 or 15 musicians are coming will close mostly just laying a foundation for this struggle just consider this week had he allowed an offended heart to be turn to bitterness he would have thrown the whole plan of God watch me these folks can walk without you watching them let's watch them come on everybody get in place so we can watch y'all walk because you all are more important than the word everybody settled now NOP back out the door this is pretty serious business here because I'm a I'm looking at some precious people who have been Paralyzed by your woundedness your offense has been contagious and there are people sitting here that haven't grown spiritually in a long time not because the opportunity wasn't before you but because you couldn't jump over that last hurdle and let it go there's not a person in this room that hasn't been betrayed wounded sold out in some way your family let you down your preachers let you down your pastor let you down there are some people who are still struggling under this thought that brother brandom let them down because he wasn't a perfect man and because he didn't have perfect recall and because he left us with some confusing questions and they can't get over that you better let that one go too because if we would have had a perfect man we might would have thought he was the second coming of Jesus Christ like some other misguided and deceived Souls but since we saw that he was flawed in his flesh and Humanity we can accept one another with our flaws and with our humanities and still respect the gift and the office in each other's lives we cannot let offense be strengthened by calling out to other spirits of envy and jealousy and Division and strife and rebellion and bitterness unforgiveness we've got to put this thing not to rest to death we have to look away to Jesus in such an hour as this it's going to happen somebody's going to let you down again somebody's going to hurt your feelings again somebody's going to wound you again some people are so wounded that all they do is go around wounding we can blame them or we can pray for them and and think in our heart how miserable it must be to be so handicapped that you live to Buckle somebody else's knee to knock somebody else down what an awful existence it doesn't sound anything like the overcoming life of a child of God there's an author his name is Francis frangipan and he says this bitterness is unfulfilled Revenge bitterness will eat you alive right it's an acid bitterness can't operate by itself it has to have a power Twin it has to pull from offense and that offense if it's partnered with bitterness you can rest assured that unforgiveness is running in the crowd that right there folks will steal your victory and it'll knock you out of God's blessing and favor I wouldn't want anybody to be so important in my life that they kept me out of God's will I wouldn't want anybody to be so important in my life that they caused me to miss the blessing because I allowed what they did to me what they said about me hinder me stop me discourage me make me quit or make me whine I don't only want to not quit I don't want to whine there's a young man around the message who's spending an awful amount of time talking about himself on social media how hurt he is with everybody and nobody acknowledges him and nobody lets him praying the prayer line and everybody talks about him behind his back and nobody wants to shake his hand and when he when they do he knows whether or not they like him you know what I'd like to say to him but he's not in any way teachable what I'd like to say to him is join the club buddy you just describe my 30 years in this message I've walked walked into rooms having not done anything to anybody in that room and knew that I was the talk of the room people that I've not talked to in years knew more about what was going on in our church than some of you that sit here every Sunday and asked me about it while I was in Tennessee they know what song s we sing and they know what losses we suffer and they know how what we preach and what we do because they've got a an anonymous window into here I know what it means I know what it means to be discounted and devalued I could whine I could write I think I'll write 50 devotionals on how I've been hurt what do you think that would do for any anybody nothing we we we got to get above that quit talking about that and talk about the victories woo I've won some how many have won some victories how many have overcome some offenses how many have loved through your pain and forgiven through the offense knowing they murdered you but you forgive them and you can hug them and you can say God bless you and I love you and mean it somebody ought to do something about that tell that talk about that write a song about that make a Blog about that don't wallow around in yesterday's junk pick up press on give him praise with you can't he he he will let's stand sing every day at least once the Little Chorus I'm going on with me Jesus just the same just sing it sing it to your top of your lungs folks May false accuse me scandalize my name but me and Charles Johnson we're going on with Jesus just the same come on I do I sing it well I'm going on with my Jesus just the same yes I'm going on with my Jesus just the same folks May false accuse me scandalize my name but I'm going on with Jesus just the same oh I'm I'm going on with my Jesus just the same yes I'm going on with Jesus just the same folks May false accuse me scandalize my name but I'm going on with Jesus just the same I I'm not convinced do it just do it do it when when you are around somebody who is mortally wounded love them Speak Life to them but God have mercy on you if you lay down with them you hear what I'm saying embrace them Speak Life to them give them a helping hand and get on a and out of there because if you lay down with them you'll take on their offense and you'd be surprise the people who are crippled by an offense that was not done to them you'd be surprised how many mamas are mad at people because their children were wronged by that person that's not your offense to carry we're parents we're Mamas and Papa Bears we we some times have to give away pieces of our mind that's why when we get older we're running a little short of it sometime but the reality is it wasn't yours my grandmother used to say the children will get out there in the yard and fume and fight and fuss knock each other down parents will get involved and everything goes to a higher level parents parents are wanting to sue go to the school board go all kinds of ways and guess where the children are backyard playing mama hates mama daddy hates Daddy and the children are all made up playing in the backyard that's how life is don't you get caught up in somebody else's Lord Jesus I I thank you for the life of Joseph I'm not done with him he's talking to me and I appreciate that so much in his in his moment when he could have he chose rather your perspective instead of his fleshly feeling or thought he decided he made a choice to trust and when he made that decision to trust you he couldn't hold on to the hurt or the Betrayal or the wound he had to believe that you had a higher purpose in all things Lord I remember reading the book and preaching the sermon years ago crucified by Christians and it came to me by the reality that it wasn't the Romans and it wasn't the Jews that cruci ified you but it was your father it was ultimately the will of God for you to die on the cross so I could forgive the Roman soldiers and I could forgive the Jews and go on and really that that's our present reality we have gone through the things that we have gone through painful hurtful sorrowful things and at any moment you could have stopped it at any moment you could have stood in the middle any moment you could have shielded us from the Betrayal or the wound but you chose rather to watch knowing that one day we would get above it and Beyond it be stronger more filled with faith and closer to the position that you could use us in the last days thank you Lord for some of it us it has been horrible pain but every bit of it has brought us closer to where you needed us to be as manifested and adopted sons of God in the end time so Lord we we are learning to kiss the waves that Dash us again and again into the Rock of Ages we love you Lord you've never done us wrong you've never failed us you have poured in oil and wine you have listened to our complaints you have heard our sorrowful cries you have seen our broken and bleeding hearts and you have loved us and healed us and restored us now we need you God to come and separate us from the residual that we have held on to so that we can be free love lives depend children depend Generations depend on us to Let It Go your strength is perfected in our weakness come Jesus and be really big and really strong in us we pray for your glory let's give him praise let's worship him

things before for you that we don't understand we don't know why it had to be the way it was but we lay it before you today as a family as a body and we say blessed be the name of the Lord in the good
