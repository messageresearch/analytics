[36:58] Hallelujah.
[37:02] He's so wonderful and beautiful.
[37:05] Certainly is. Do you have a need today?
[37:08] By the lifting of the
[37:10] hand. All over this building, I see
[37:12] needs.
[37:16] I need you, Lord, more than I've ever
[37:17] needed you before.
[37:23] I need you, Jesus. I need you.
[37:26] Out across the
[37:27] stream, the Lord sees the need that you
[37:30] have. You may not be able to tell us
[37:33] what that need is, but you can tell him.
[37:38] And that's what's important because he's
[37:40] the one that can actually do something
[37:41] about it. That's it. He can heal you. He
[37:46] can deliver you. He can set you free
[37:50] from your addictions.
[37:52] That's who he is. Talk to him. Amen. And
[37:56] we'll join our faith with yours and
[37:58] believe God to meet your need.
[38:01] Let's pray. Brother and sister Van
[38:05] Huden, brother George and Sister Verique
[38:07] and family from the Netherlands reached
[38:09] out today with a prayer request for a
[38:11] friend of theirs for some time who is
[38:13] sick, who's believing for healing. And
[38:16] it seems that his body continues to go
[38:19] in the other way, the other direction,
[38:21] but he's still confessing and believing
[38:23] his healing. Sister Cindy Chadwick, her
[38:26] sister-in-law Alana has had serious
[38:29] surgery this week and is in a lot of
[38:31] pain. And also, Sister Cindy is asking
[38:34] for another sister-in-law who needs a
[38:36] touch from the Lord this morning. Those
[38:38] are many that uh stand in great need of
[38:42] prayer and have sent their prayer
[38:43] requests in. God sees every one of them.
[38:46] All right. Every one of these needs, we
[38:49] are going to take them to our papa.
[38:50] Those that'll be traveling this
[38:53] afternoon as well as tomorrow. We want
[38:56] to ask the Lord to protect them and give
[38:58] them grace as they travel. Sing this
[39:00] course with us
[39:04] [Music]
[39:05] today. Father in heaven, how we love
[39:10] you.
[39:13] We lift her in all the
[39:19] earth. May your kingdom be
[39:23] established in our
[39:26] praises as your people declare your
[39:31] mighty works.

[41:01] know what they are, but we don't have
[41:03] to.
[41:08] We just thank you that you are able to
[41:10] meet and answer each one of them, Lord.
[41:13] Amen. In your perfect timing, we may not
[41:16] understand

[44:02] being here and we're glad that you're

[44:11] here on this back row, we welcome you.
[44:13] The Lord bless you. May God give you
[44:15] what you need while you're here today.
[44:17] And also this young couple I saw come in
[44:19] a little while ago. God bless you. We're
[44:22] glad that you have come to be a part of
[44:23] this service today. We're here to lift
[44:26] up the name of Jesus. He's the worthy
[44:29] one. He's the one who paid our debt and
[44:32] we owe it to him. He is worthy of what
[44:35] praise we give him and a whole lot more.
[44:39] Let's uh let's worship with our brother
[44:41] as he sings today. We're glad to have
[44:43] him here from North Carolina. God bless
[44:45] you, Brother Dylan. Amen. Amen. God

[44:48] of the Lord this morning? Yes. Amen.
[44:50] There's no other place I'd rather be.
[44:52] Amen. Amen. And I asked brother Steve uh
[44:54] in the back if I could share a
[44:57] testimony, you know, about the goodness
[44:59] of God. Amen. You know, has he been good
[45:01] to you? So good. He's been so good. We
[45:05] if we would just take time, it would
[45:06] take millions of lifetimes to be able to
[45:09] tell how good he's been.
[45:11] How good he really is. That's the truth.
[45:14] You know, he's a God that will never
[45:15] leave you. Amen. He'll never forsake
[45:18] you. It's a promise. Amen. A promise.
[45:22] You know, the Bible says in Psalms 34,
[45:24] I'd like to, this is my testimony
[45:26] scripture. Oh, magnify the Lord with me.
[45:29] Yes. Yes. And let us exalt his name.
[45:33] Yes. Together. Together.
[45:36] The Bible says, I will bless the Lord at
[45:38] all times. His praise shall continually
[45:42] be in whose mouth? My mouth.
[45:45] His praise shall be in my mouth.
[45:48] My soul shall make her boast in who? The
[45:51] Lord. The Lord.
[45:53] The humble shall hear thereof and be
[45:55] glad. Oh, magnify the Lord with me. Yes.
[45:59] Yes. And let's exalt his name together.
[46:02] I sought the Lord and he heard me. Heard
[46:05] me. Not only did he hear me, but he
[46:08] delivered me.
[46:10] Not only did he hear me, but he saved
[46:12] me.
[46:14] Cuz you sought him. Amen.
[46:17] And he delivered you from all your
[46:19] fears. They looked unto him and were
[46:23] lightened and their faces they weren't
[46:27] ashamed. Are you ashamed of Jesus? Not
[46:29] at all. Not at
[46:31] all. This poor man cried and the Lord
[46:34] heard him and saved him. Uhhuh. Out of
[46:37] all his troubles.
[46:39] The angel of the Lord encampeth around
[46:42] them. He does that fear. Yes. Fear him.
[46:48] Not only does he encamp around them, but
[46:50] he's delivering you. Yeah. He's
[46:53] protecting you.
[46:55] He's healing you.
[46:57] He's with you. He won't ever leave you,
[47:00] nor will he forsake you, but he'll be
[47:02] with you always, even till the end of
[47:04] the world. Oh, taste and see that the
[47:06] Lord is good. Blessed is the man that
[47:10] trustth in him. Do you trust in him this
[47:14] morning? Do you trust in him? Amen.
[47:18] July 24th of
[47:20] 2024, I do tree
[47:23] work. I work for Aspen Tree Expert. I do
[47:26] line
[47:28] clearance. We had a uh active shooter
[47:33] situation. Some of you might know
[47:37] this. And we were on this
[47:41] hillside. this homeowner came out and he
[47:44] talked to me. He says, "I I lost my job
[47:47] and I need a new job." And I said,
[47:49] "Well, I can help you out with that.
[47:51] Just give me your name, your number, and
[47:53] I'll put you in the system and we'll get
[47:55] you squirted away. We'll get you a job."
[47:57] And he says, "I might do that." And then
[47:58] one of the boys asked, "Can you pass a
[48:00] drug test?" And he says,
[48:02] "No." And we said,
[48:04] "Well, that might be a
[48:06] problem." He says, "Well, I'll think
[48:08] about it and I'll just maybe come back
[48:10] later and tell you guys what I think."
[48:12] And an hour later, he comes out with a
[48:14] rifle.
[48:17] The whole time I shared it with Austin
[48:19] at the house yesterday,
[48:21] and but he was eyeballing us from head
[48:24] to toe, looking at us. Yeah. He was
[48:27] studying his opponent. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[48:31] And we were standing there
[48:33] and I told him, I said, 'Well, I could
[48:36] do what I can.
[48:37] And but he comes out with this rifle and
[48:41] I see the rifle point at me. I've been
[48:44] around guns my whole life. I'm a hunter.
[48:46] I I was raised in a, you know, law
[48:49] enforcement, military background,
[48:51] household, and family, and you know, so
[48:54] I've been around guns my whole life. And
[48:56] I wasn't really afraid until I seen the
[48:58] gun pointed at me. that'll make a
[48:59] difference. And I said, "Guys, he has a
[49:02] gun." And I shoved one of my guys to the
[49:05] ground. As I shoved him, I had a bullet
[49:07] fly by my
[49:09] head. And as I moved to the left for my
[49:12] gun that's in my bag, I have two more
[49:15] bullets flying by my
[49:18] head. Two of my guys get shot. One of
[49:22] them in the throat and the other one in
[49:23] the face. And now I'm having to deal
[49:26] with them, getting them to safety and
[49:28] getting myself to safety.
[49:32] And everyone survived. Praise his name.
[49:36] Because God was on our side of God. It's
[49:39] the goodness of God. Oh yeah. Dustin
[49:41] spent three and a half months, four
[49:43] months in the hospital. And I visited
[49:45] him every single day. Went down after
[49:48] work, brother Steve. I went down there
[49:50] and I I I would pray with him. Everyone
[49:51] at work knows me as preacher.
[49:55] And uh and
[49:57] so I was I was uh I was praying for
[50:01] Dustin and I don't see a hope in sight.
[50:03] I'm going to be honest. I didn't see any
[50:05] I didn't see a hope. I get it. I'm
[50:08] seeing a man who's laying on a bed with
[50:09] tubes and IVs and a ventilator and he's
[50:13] not even breathing on his own. He's
[50:15] having 90% of his own bre or 90% of help
[50:20] with breath. He's just on the verge and
[50:23] the doctors are saying he'll never walk.
[50:25] He'll never talk because the bullet is
[50:27] lodged in his voice box.
[50:30] [Music]
[50:32] I prayed for him and I laid hands on him
[50:35] as only I knew how to do. My Bible told
[50:38] me that if I lay hands on the sick, they
[50:40] shall recover. That's the word. When I
[50:43] laid hands on him, two or three weeks
[50:45] later, Dustin calls me on the phone and
[50:48] Dustin's talking to me. And now, not
[50:50] only that, I get a video. Dustin's
[50:53] walking. The doctor comes in the room
[50:55] and Dustin is now standing up and he's
[50:58] walking in his hospital room. He's
[51:00] walking around. And who did it? I
[51:03] couldn't do it. It wasn't that I laid
[51:05] hands on him. I'm not anyone special.
[51:07] But it's because I applied the word.
[51:09] When you apply the word on your
[51:11] situations, when you apply the word over
[51:14] any situation, no matter what lie, what
[51:16] what's being pulled against you, no
[51:18] matter what complexes, God will always
[51:21] come down and he'll be on your side.
[51:25] Dustin's walking. He's talking. Salvador
[51:27] was shot in the face. The doctor said
[51:29] the bullet should have killed him,
[51:31] right? But the bullet went through his
[51:33] cheek and went out his nose.
[51:36] Who can change a tra trajectory of a
[51:39] bullet? God can. Who can protect you in
[51:43] your situations? God can. Ben, when you
[51:46] and Joshua flipped your
[51:49] truck, God protected you.
[51:53] It's the goodness of God. If you look
[51:55] back and you see from when you were
[51:57] first born to where you are now. Yes,
[52:00] sir. How good has he been, brother? How
[52:03] good has he been? Oh, yes.
[52:07] Do you love him?
[52:09] Do you love me? Yeah. I do.
[52:13] Amen. I love
[52:15] y'all. Brother Steve, I love you. Love
[52:17] you, too. Brother Wes, I love
[52:21] you. I love you, Lord. Yes. Yes. For
[52:26] your mercy never fails
[52:31] me all my days.
[52:34] I've been held in your hands.
[52:39] From the moment that I wake
[52:42] up until I lay my
[52:47] head, I will sing of the goodness of
[52:52] God.
[52:57] I love you, Lord,
[53:02] for your mercy never fails
[53:06] me. All my
[53:09] days I've been held in your
[53:14] hands. From the moment that I wake
[53:18] up until I lay my head. Oh, I will sing
[53:26] of the
[53:27] goodness of
[53:28] [Music]
[53:32] God. All my life you have been faithful.
[53:38] [Music]
[53:41] All my life you have been so so
[53:48] good. With every breath that I am
[53:53] able. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of
[54:00] God. Guess what? I love his voice. Love
[54:03] your voice.
[54:07] You have led me through the
[54:11] fire in the darkest
[54:14] night. You are close like no
[54:19] other. I've known you as my
[54:23] father. I've known you as my friend. Is
[54:26] he your friend? And I have lived in the
[54:31] goodness of God.
[54:38] All my life you have been
[54:41] faithful. Tell him how faithful he's
[54:44] been. And all my life you have been so
[54:49] so
[54:52] good. With every breath that I am
[54:57] aable. Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[55:03] of God. Guess
[55:07] what? Your goodness is running after.
[55:11] It's running after
[55:15] me. Your goodness is running after. It's
[55:19] running after me. With my life laid
[55:24] down, I surrender now. I give you
[55:28] everything.
[55:31] Your goodness is running after. It's
[55:35] running after me. Your
[55:38] goodness, Your goodness is running
[55:41] after. It's running after
[55:46] me. Your goodness is running after. It's
[55:50] running after
[55:52] me. With my life laid down, I surrender
[55:56] now. I give you
[56:01] everything. Your goodness is running
[56:04] after. It's running after
[56:09] me. And all my life you have been
[56:17] faithful. All my life you have been so
[56:22] so good.
[56:26] With every breath that I am
[56:31] able, oh, I will
[56:34] sing of the
[56:36] goodness of
[56:38] God. Let's sing the first verse one more
[56:41] time. I love you,
[56:44] [Music]
[56:46] Lord, for your mercy never fails me.
[56:52] And all my
[56:54] days I've been held in your
[56:59] hands. From the moment that I wake
[57:03] up until I lay my
[57:08] head, I will sing of the goodness of
[57:13] God.
[57:18] Oh my life you have been
[57:23] [Music]
[57:25] faithful. Yeah. All my life you have
[57:29] been so so good.
[57:34] With every breath that I am
[57:39] able, I will sing of the goodness of
[57:46] God. Yes, I will sing of the
[57:52] goodness of
[57:59] God. Oh, can you testify to his
[58:02] goodness?
[58:04] Yes, yes, yes,
[58:08] yes. Oh, he's a good, good
[58:13] father. Thank you,
[58:16] Lord. You may have your seats
[58:19] today. I'm going to ask brother Josiah,
[58:22] brother Steven
[58:24] Yantis, if these brothers will come and
[58:26] help me with the tithe and the offering
[58:28] today. But let them come to you. Let you
[58:31] give your tithe and offering to the Lord
[58:33] for he is the one who provided for us to
[58:36] start with. Father, I thank you for your
[58:39] provision. I thank you that in all
[58:42] things you are good, good, good. And as
[58:46] we give of our tithe and offering today,

[59:02] Lord. You have been so good to us and
[59:05] we're so thankful. As we give our tithe
[59:08] and offering, we pray that you will
[59:09] bless the giver. And I pray, God, that
[59:12] it would be multiplied to your goodness
[59:14] and to your purposes for the kingdom. In
[59:17] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[59:19] pray. Amen. Let's worship together as we
[59:22] give our tithe and offering today. We're
[59:25] going to ask brother Kate if he'll just
[59:26] lead us right into the preaching of the
[59:28] word. And so we want to worship and keep
[59:31] the atmosphere and such. You know,
[59:33] giving is is a part of our worship. And
[59:36] so we as as brother Kate is leading us
[59:38] in worship, we're giving. We're just
[59:40] worshiping the Lord, preparing ourselves
[59:42] for the preaching of the word as our
[59:45] pastor would come in just a few moments
[59:47] to preach the word.
[59:55] [Music]
[1:00:27] I was a rich. I remember who I
[1:00:33] was. I was lost. I was
[1:00:37] blind. I was running out of
[1:00:41] time. But
[1:00:43] sin
[1:00:45] separated. The breach was far too wide.
[1:00:50] From the far side of the
[1:00:53] chasm, you held me in your
[1:00:57] side. So
[1:00:59] you made a
[1:01:01] way across the great
[1:01:05] divide. Left behind heaven's
[1:01:09] throne to build it here
[1:01:13] inside. hidden there at the
[1:01:17] cross. You paid the debt I
[1:01:20] owed, broke my chains, freed my
[1:01:24] soul. For the first time, I had hope.
[1:01:29] So, thank you, Jesus, for the
[1:01:35] blood
[1:01:37] applied. Thank you, Jesus. It has washed
[1:01:43] me
[1:01:45] wine. Thank you Jesus. You have saved my
[1:01:53] life. Brought me from the darkness into
[1:01:59] glorious
[1:02:00] [Music]
[1:02:03] light. You took my place, laid inside my
[1:02:09] tomb of sin.
[1:02:11] You were buried for three
[1:02:14] days. Then you walked right out
[1:02:18] again and now has no sting.
[1:02:26] Oh, for I have been
[1:02:30] transformed by the blood
[1:02:35] of you.
[1:02:39] [Music]
[1:02:43] Thank you Jesus
[1:02:50] as Thank you Jesus you have saved my
[1:02:57] life brought me from the darkness into
[1:03:02] glorious.
[1:03:05] Oh, thank you Jesus for the
[1:03:11] blood
[1:03:13] applied. Thank you Jesus. It has washed
[1:03:19] me
[1:03:20] white. Oh, thank you Jesus. You have
[1:03:26] saved my life.
[1:03:29] brought me from the darkness into
[1:03:34] glorious
[1:03:38] light. There is nothing stronger than
[1:03:42] the wonder working power of the blood.
[1:03:50] the
[1:03:53] blood cause as sons and daughters we are
[1:03:58] answer by our father through the
[1:04:03] blood through the blood.
[1:04:08] Oh, there is nothing stronger than the
[1:04:13] wonder working power of the
[1:04:18] blood. Oh, through the
[1:04:22] blood that calls us sons and daughters.
[1:04:26] We are answered by the father through
[1:04:31] the blood.
[1:04:34] through the
[1:04:38] blood. Thank you. Thank you Jesus for
[1:04:42] the blood of I want to thank you Jesus.
[1:04:47] Thank you Jesus. You have
[1:04:52] me.
[1:04:55] Thank you Jesus. You have saved my life.
[1:05:03] brought me from the darkness into
[1:05:08] glorious
[1:05:10] life and
[1:05:12] gloryy to his his
[1:05:18] name.
[1:05:20] Glory to his name.
[1:05:26] Oh, there to my heart was a blood of
[1:05:35] Oh,
[1:05:37] glory to his name. Sing glory to his
[1:05:42] name again. Oh,
[1:05:45] glory to his name.
[1:05:51] I'm singing
[1:05:53] glory to glory to his
[1:05:59] name and there to my heart was a blood
[1:06:06] applied. We sing
[1:06:10] glory
[1:06:12] to his name.
[1:06:15] Will you give the Lord another praise?
[1:06:19] My
[1:06:23] God,
[1:06:26] glory,
[1:06:30] [Applause]
[1:06:32] glory. Isn't he wonderful?
[1:06:36] Have you tried him and found him to be
[1:06:38] wonderful?
[1:06:40] Didn't Didn't you hear brother Dylan
[1:06:41] reading, "Oh, taste
[1:06:44] and see that the Lord is good." Is there
[1:06:49] anybody in here that has tasted of the
[1:06:51] Lord and found that he is good in all of
[1:06:55] his ways?
[1:06:57] Oh, there is no shadow of turning in
[1:06:59] him. And once you've tasted him and his
[1:07:03] goodness and his mercy and his love,
[1:07:05] there's nothing else that will satisfy.
[1:07:08] Amen. As we heard last night, didn't
[1:07:10] brother Dwayne do a wonderful job last
[1:07:13] night. God is good. He's so good. I I
[1:07:17] still feel like I could fly.
[1:07:19] There's just something moving around us
[1:07:21] and I know what it is. It's the presence
[1:07:24] of the Lord and he's wonderful and
[1:07:26] worthy. Thank you for being here. I
[1:07:28] realize that you're standing and we're
[1:07:30] going uh to go to the word in just a
[1:07:33] moment and um I I have not gathered all
[1:07:37] the birthdays and you'll have to forgive
[1:07:40] me for for not being able to do that
[1:07:42] just yet, but I did notice that it is
[1:07:44] sister Claudia's birthday today and I
[1:07:47] think that she is in Brazil and uh I I
[1:07:51] would like to send her love and a happy
[1:07:54] birthday. also, Brother John Hall,
[1:07:56] who'll be streaming today. And uh I'll
[1:07:58] do my best Tuesday night to get the rest
[1:08:00] of them in. It didn't look like there's
[1:08:02] any among us for Monday, but forgive me.
[1:08:05] Uh there's just a lot going on in the in
[1:08:08] the natural. And a lot going on in the
[1:08:11] spiritual. Do you believe that?
[1:08:14] Why don't you go ahead and get your
[1:08:15] Bible while you're standing? And uh I
[1:08:18] like to see people bring their Bible. I
[1:08:21] do. I know we've got phones,
[1:08:27] that make us
[1:08:28] [Music]
[1:08:33] dumb. Smartphones that make us dumb.
[1:08:36] What do you mean by that? I mean, aren't
[1:08:38] people always saying to you all the
[1:08:40] time,
[1:08:42] "Huh?
[1:08:44] Huh? You're talking to
[1:08:46] Huh?" And I said, "You put that down,
[1:08:49] you'd understand. and you'd hear what I
[1:08:50] said and you'd get it.
[1:08:54] True.
[1:08:55] Well, this start off with a bang. Amen.
[1:08:58] There's nothing wrong with having a
[1:09:00] phone. I'm glad to have one. I don't use
[1:09:03] it for calls usually, but I'm glad to
[1:09:05] have one. But I know that people have
[1:09:07] become way too dependent on those things
[1:09:11] and they miss. They really miss. I read
[1:09:14] an article. I know you're standing. That
[1:09:16] means you'll listen. I read an article
[1:09:18] this week that said if you would take 30
[1:09:22] minutes a day and read a real
[1:09:26] book, not a screen, but a real book.
[1:09:30] Well, we know the best book to read. You
[1:09:33] heard it last night, the Bible. The
[1:09:35] printed word of God. They said if this
[1:09:39] was a a a highly complex article, but it
[1:09:42] it boiled down to this simple reality.
[1:09:45] If you would spend 30 minutes every day
[1:09:47] reading a book without
[1:09:50] distraction, that means not taking
[1:09:53] calls, not scrolling, not looking at
[1:09:55] notifications, not checking social
[1:09:58] media, not checking your stocks, not
[1:10:01] looking at the weather, not tweeting,
[1:10:03] twitting, xing, whatever else, none of
[1:10:06] that. you would begin to rewire your
[1:10:11] brain and you would help yourself
[1:10:14] neurologically get out of the epidemic
[1:10:17] of ADHD.
[1:10:20] We are under a global epidemic.
[1:10:25] Most everybody in my life has ADHD to a
[1:10:30] certain degree. Somebody said, "I'm not
[1:10:32] going to claim that." I wouldn't either.
[1:10:34] But the reality is we did it. We've done
[1:10:38] it. And I tell you, I told my wife, I
[1:10:42] said, "I do, but I'm going to make a
[1:10:44] conscious effort to do it without
[1:10:46] distraction. And I'm going to try my
[1:10:48] best to expand my attention span."
[1:10:52] Expand my attention span because I
[1:10:55] believe it would be helpful for me not
[1:10:57] to be so easily distracted by the things
[1:11:00] of this life. I'm waiting on your amen.
[1:11:03] Amen. So if you have an
[1:11:06] oldfashioned bound printed page Bible,
[1:11:10] use it. If you don't understand Psalm
[1:11:13] 107 and verse 23 is where we're going to
[1:11:16] start. And while you're turning there,
[1:11:17] we've had lots of good singing, but I
[1:11:21] want you to sing this chorus with me. I
[1:11:23] don't know why this has been the the
[1:11:25] emphasis, but I want you to sing this
[1:11:27] chorus with me. Just a little bit of
[1:11:29] precious blood. Do you know what key
[1:11:31] that would be?
[1:11:34] Just sing just a tad of this. We're
[1:11:36] getting ready to enter into the season
[1:11:37] of Passover and it causes us to remember
[1:11:41] that one day the lamb, the lamb
[1:11:45] came and paid the price.
[1:11:49] For his
[1:11:51] blood was not just blood of another
[1:11:58] spotless
[1:12:00] lamb, but his
[1:12:03] blood was precious blood. For it washed
[1:12:07] the sins of
[1:12:11] man, and his blood heals my body. Oh,
[1:12:18] and it sets my spirit
[1:12:23] free. I'm so glad this precious
[1:12:28] blood still
[1:12:30] flows from
[1:12:33] Calvary for his blood.
[1:12:39] Do you believe that of
[1:12:41] another
[1:12:42] spotless
[1:12:44] lamb? But his blood
[1:12:49] Oh, for it washed the sins of
[1:12:55] man and his blood. It has healed my
[1:13:00] body. It has set my spirit free.
[1:13:07] I'm so
[1:13:09] glad this precious blood still
[1:13:13] blows from
[1:13:16] Calary. Yes, I'm so glad this precious
[1:13:22] blood still
[1:13:24] flows from
[1:13:26] [Music]
[1:13:29] Calvary. Do you believe it still
[1:13:32] flows? I believe it's still available.
[1:13:36] Oh yeah.
[1:13:38] Still paying the price.
[1:13:40] Amen. Let's thank God for these
[1:13:43] musicians. What a wonderful job you've
[1:13:47] done. Most of the time they are
[1:13:51] musicians. Sometimes they are
[1:13:54] magicians. They have to be to pull it
[1:13:57] all together. God bless them and uh work
[1:14:01] in their lives in greater ways. They
[1:14:03] bring their gifts unto the Lord and he
[1:14:04] anoints them. How many of you believe
[1:14:06] the anointing destroys the yoke?
[1:14:10] I can't imagine going to church and not
[1:14:12] encountering the anointing every time I
[1:14:14] go. I told my wife this week, we were
[1:14:16] talking and I said, "Honey, can you
[1:14:17] imagine going to church service after
[1:14:20] service after service and never one time
[1:14:23] sensing the heavy presence of the Lord
[1:14:25] in the house?" How do people continue? I
[1:14:29] don't know how people continue. I know
[1:14:31] no matter what building I'm going into
[1:14:34] uh as the church, I know I'm going to
[1:14:36] encounter him because I take him with me
[1:14:39] and I'm determined when I get there to
[1:14:42] bring him into the presence of others. I
[1:14:44] want the Lord to go with us, don't you?
[1:14:46] And let's We ought to shift the presence
[1:14:48] of uh uh the atmosphere by his presence
[1:14:51] in us wherever we go. The workplace,
[1:14:55] if you're brave enough to go to Walmart,
[1:14:57] you ought to be the light. You ought to
[1:14:59] make a difference there. Amen. Brother
[1:15:01] Dylan, that was an outstanding
[1:15:03] testimony. I never heard the end of it.
[1:15:06] So thankful you shared it with us today.
[1:15:08] All we did is we got a we had a text
[1:15:11] that said, "Pray now. Dylan is in a
[1:15:13] serious place with an active shooter."
[1:15:16] And uh but I I knew you were alive cuz I
[1:15:19] just saw you in North Carolina. And I
[1:15:22] checked through somebody that and that
[1:15:23] you were all right, but I didn't know
[1:15:25] that story. Aren't you glad you got to
[1:15:27] hear that today? You know, you say,
[1:15:29] "Well, I I I never I know that happens,
[1:15:31] but I'll never know anybody. I probably
[1:15:33] never even know anybody involved in an
[1:15:35] active shooting." You do now. And those
[1:15:38] of you that don't know, uh Dylan's wife
[1:15:41] and uh little girl, they'll be with him
[1:15:43] maybe the next time he visits. Uh he is
[1:15:47] married to Brother Danny and Sister Lisa
[1:15:50] Adams daughter, Rachel, and their
[1:15:53] precious little baby girl, uh Jubil. Is
[1:15:56] that right? Jubilee was born a day after
[1:16:01] Elelliana. And they both she Elelliana
[1:16:04] had a struggle getting here and Jubilee
[1:16:06] had a struggle just at her birth and
[1:16:09] after. And God was so good. I heard this
[1:16:13] squeak in the nursery when I was
[1:16:14] preaching two weeks ago in Morgan. I
[1:16:17] heard a screech in the nursery as I was
[1:16:19] coming out of the study. I saw a young
[1:16:21] lady standing there. I thought it was
[1:16:23] Jenna. Her back was turned and the
[1:16:25] screech sounded exactly like Elelliana.
[1:16:29] So I said,
[1:16:30] "Oh, Pap knows that little sc." And
[1:16:34] sister and sister Rachel turned around.
[1:16:36] She was so gracious. She said, "I
[1:16:39] thought I figure you thought that was
[1:16:41] [Music]
[1:16:43] Elelliana. I felt about that tall. She
[1:16:46] so graciously covered my shame and made
[1:16:49] me feel all right about it." And uh I've
[1:16:51] known I've known Rachel's family uh for
[1:16:54] a long long time and they're real
[1:16:56] they're real Christian people. They love
[1:16:58] the Lord. And that just uh also Josiah
[1:17:02] Aaho and Katie who was here with us for
[1:17:05] a month or so uh what a couple Hanukkah
[1:17:08] ago or something like that. Um that
[1:17:12] Dylan is is uh her brother. So they are
[1:17:16] related. And we could go on and on and
[1:17:18] on, but I I wanted you to know who he
[1:17:20] is. And he he ministers and maybe
[1:17:22] sometime it'll work out that he could
[1:17:24] preach for us. I'm glad he's here. Psalm
[1:17:27] 107 verse 23 through30. You you act a
[1:17:31] little bit tired. Uh so I'm asking you
[1:17:34] to try to rise above that and hear from
[1:17:37] the Lord because I've heard from him on
[1:17:40] your behalf and I want to deliver that
[1:17:42] for you today to the best of my ability.
[1:17:44] Uh it was all my intention to go one
[1:17:47] step further into the series that we're
[1:17:49] working on right now. And the Lord this
[1:17:51] morning, well through the night, the
[1:17:54] Lord said, "No, I want I want you to do
[1:17:56] something a little different." So here
[1:17:57] we are. Psalm 107:23.
[1:18:00] They that go down to the sea in ships,
[1:18:04] that do business in great waters, these
[1:18:10] see the works of the Lord, and his
[1:18:14] wonders in the deep. For he commandeth
[1:18:18] and raiseth the stormy
[1:18:22] wind. Is that what it says? Which
[1:18:25] lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount
[1:18:29] up to the heaven. They go down again to
[1:18:32] the depths. Their soul is melted because
[1:18:36] of trouble. The psalmist is
[1:18:40] personifying the ocean, the winds and
[1:18:43] the waves as part of God's creation.
[1:18:47] They're mounting up to the heaven, going
[1:18:49] down to the deep. Their soul is melted
[1:18:52] because of trouble. They reel to and
[1:18:54] fro. Those who go out to sea like a
[1:18:58] drunken man, stagger like a drunken man,
[1:19:01] and are at their
[1:19:04] wits end. Ha. Have you ever been at your
[1:19:07] wits end in the amplified that says all
[1:19:11] their wisdom has come to nothing?
[1:19:14] They've been doing this as sailors, as
[1:19:16] fishermen year after year after year
[1:19:18] after year. Now they're facing a storm
[1:19:21] unlike any they have ever faced before.
[1:19:24] Have you ever been there?
[1:19:26] And they have come to the end of their
[1:19:28] knowledge and to the end of their
[1:19:30] wisdom. Their wit is run out. Then they
[1:19:34] cry unto the Lord in their trouble. And
[1:19:38] he what? Bringeth them out
[1:19:44] of their distresses. He maketh
[1:19:49] He maketh the storm a calm.
[1:19:53] Have you ever seen him do it? Come on.
[1:19:57] So that the waves thereof are
[1:20:01] still. Then are they glad because they
[1:20:04] be
[1:20:05] quiet. So he bringeth them unto their
[1:20:12] I've anchored my soul.
[1:20:15] The songwriter said in the haven of
[1:20:18] rest. How many of you have found anchor?
[1:20:22] You found refuge in his haven, the haven
[1:20:26] of rest. Lord Jesus, we are here today
[1:20:29] in your name and you ministered to us on
[1:20:32] such a deep level last night and you
[1:20:34] gave us sleep. Might not have been as
[1:20:37] long as we would have liked and we may
[1:20:39] have woke up a little tired, but we're
[1:20:41] here and we are ready, Lord, once again
[1:20:44] to hear from you. You knew before the
[1:20:46] foundations of the world who would be
[1:20:48] here and what their needs were. That's
[1:20:51] what I believe about you, that you're
[1:20:53] omnisient and that you are not bound or
[1:20:56] limited by time. You're dwelling in
[1:20:58] eternity and you know everything about
[1:21:01] us today. Nothing is hid from your
[1:21:03] sight. So come on Lord and talk to us,
[1:21:06] help us, strengthen us, correct us,
[1:21:09] direct us in whatever way we need it.
[1:21:12] And we'll give you the glory and the
[1:21:14] honor and all the praise for it belongth
[1:21:16] to you. In the name above every name,
[1:21:18] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[1:21:20] ask this thing. And the saint said, you
[1:21:24] may be seated. I want to speak to you
[1:21:26] for a little while, maybe a long
[1:21:29] while on he maketh the storm a calm. I
[1:21:35] don't know anybody who can do it like
[1:21:37] God can. I don't know anybody that can
[1:21:40] turn a tumultuous, raging, wild storm in
[1:21:45] your life to a calm with just a word.
[1:21:48] But he can. He doesn't even have to
[1:21:51] talk. All he has to do is point in that
[1:21:53] direction. Amen. A a ma one man said to
[1:21:57] him, "Lord, I'm not worthy that you
[1:22:00] would even come to my house and pray for
[1:22:02] my servant. And I'm not even asking you
[1:22:04] to come, but if you would just speak the
[1:22:08] word, if you would just say the word, I
[1:22:11] know that my servant will be healed."
[1:22:14] How many of you believe that? You
[1:22:16] believe he still talks? How many of you
[1:22:19] know he's still talking? He's an ontime
[1:22:21] God. He's a talking God. a walking
[1:22:24] talking God. He's still real and he
[1:22:28] still points at the storm and he still
[1:22:30] speaks to the storm and he still has
[1:22:33] authority over the natural storm and
[1:22:35] even the emotional storm and the
[1:22:38] metaphorical storm and the spiritual
[1:22:41] storm that may be raging in your life.
[1:22:44] I've taken this title before and a
[1:22:47] portion of this text, but God gave me
[1:22:49] something else and I want to go into it
[1:22:51] this morning. So don't think I've heard
[1:22:53] it so I can nap. No, no, no. Stay with
[1:22:56] me. Psalm 9:es 9-11. The Lord also will
[1:23:01] be a refuge for
[1:23:03] the oppressed that's pressed down. To be
[1:23:08] oppressed is not to be possessed. To be
[1:23:12] possessed demonically is to be occupied
[1:23:15] from the inside. But to be oppressed is
[1:23:19] to be pushed down, squeezed, limited
[1:23:23] from the outside. This is the the plight
[1:23:27] of the children of God in the last days.
[1:23:29] We are pressed in. We are oppressed.
[1:23:33] There is a heaviness that wants to take
[1:23:35] over in our life, in our emotions, in
[1:23:39] our dealings with others. But I want you
[1:23:41] to know we don't have to accept that we
[1:23:44] have been called above the spirit of the
[1:23:46] age. As we said, we've been given the
[1:23:49] anointing of a flying eagle. Not a
[1:23:52] molting eagle, not a valley dwelling
[1:23:54] eagle, but one who has taken his
[1:23:57] position, his election. He knows who he
[1:24:00] is. And the fourth living creature is
[1:24:03] that flying eagle. I I noticed that uh
[1:24:07] when John was describing these four
[1:24:09] living creatures, he didn't say one was
[1:24:12] a walking man and one was a bellowing ox
[1:24:14] or a beast. But when it came to the
[1:24:17] eagle, he gave some vision, some visual,
[1:24:21] some action. And he said he's as of a
[1:24:24] flying eagle, meaning one that is
[1:24:27] actively soaring above. I am persuaded
[1:24:32] today more than ever before that God has
[1:24:35] made a provision. He has made a way to
[1:24:38] get you and I above
[1:24:41] above. Hello. Above all, above every
[1:24:44] hardship, above every hindrance, above
[1:24:46] every
[1:24:48] oppression, sir, above every lie, above
[1:24:52] every infirmity, every symptom,
[1:24:56] every political
[1:24:57] pressure, a every life-threatening
[1:25:00] situation, I'm persuaded God has made a
[1:25:03] way. Over and over and over and over
[1:25:07] again, he keeps making a way. He makes
[1:25:09] the storm a calm.
[1:25:12] He
[1:25:13] recreates what is tumultuous, what is
[1:25:17] raging, what is wild. And just with his
[1:25:21] touch, with his word, with his
[1:25:24] intervention,
[1:25:25] it becomes something entirely different.
[1:25:28] How can he do that? Because he's the
[1:25:30] creator.
[1:25:32] The Lord also will be a refuge for the
[1:25:34] oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.
[1:25:38] and they that know thy name will put
[1:25:41] their trust in thee. For thou, Lord hath
[1:25:45] not forsaken them that seek thee. I know
[1:25:49] his name.
[1:25:51] I want you to know today, I know his
[1:25:54] name. He has many redemptive names. We
[1:25:58] could call him many things. He's
[1:25:59] identified as such in the scripture. But
[1:26:02] when it was time for there to be a name
[1:26:05] that would cover all that God is
[1:26:10] in English, we have this phrase Lord
[1:26:14] Jesus Christ, which is not a
[1:26:17] phrase. It's a name and it is the name
[1:26:22] we we can say in Hebrew, we can say
[1:26:25] Yeshua and that's perfectly wonderful
[1:26:28] because it's a Hebrew word. It appears
[1:26:31] in its English transliteration in the
[1:26:33] Old Testament as salvation. And is he
[1:26:36] not salvation? That's not what he does
[1:26:38] only. It's who he is. He is salvation.
[1:26:42] But he's called Jesus in Spanish. And we
[1:26:45] could go on. I don't know. I Icelandic.
[1:26:48] What? What is Jesus? How do you say
[1:26:50] Jesus in Icelandic? Hawk, is he up
[1:26:53] there? Say it again. Yes. No. No. You
[1:26:58] got it.
[1:27:00] Who who can give us
[1:27:02] Jesus? What about Pennsylvania Dutch? Is
[1:27:05] it just what is
[1:27:08] it?
[1:27:10] Yzu. Anybody else know his name in
[1:27:12] another language? French. What's his
[1:27:14] name in
[1:27:15] French? Say it again. Yeah. Say it
[1:27:21] again. All right. Anybody know his name
[1:27:24] in another language
[1:27:26] here? in in Portuguese. And uh well, we
[1:27:31] could get brother we could get brother
[1:27:32] Isaac Short to give us his name in in
[1:27:34] mountain English,
[1:27:40] right? I love you, little
[1:27:44] brother.
[1:27:46] Jesus. Somebody said, I just say his
[1:27:48] name.
[1:27:49] Jesus. That's what you call him when you
[1:27:51] need him. But there is a name. That's
[1:27:54] right. Oh yes, there is a name that
[1:27:58] covers all that he is. Lord Jesus
[1:28:00] Christ. Somebody said when what are you
[1:28:03] going to call the father? Lord Jesus
[1:28:04] Christ. When you need Jesus, what are
[1:28:07] you going to Lord Jesus Christ? When you
[1:28:09] need the Holy Ghost to move on your
[1:28:11] behalf, what are you going to Lord Jesus
[1:28:12] Christ? There is a name.
[1:28:15] There is a name. I know his name. They
[1:28:19] used to sing a song, I'm so glad I know
[1:28:21] who Jesus is. I am, brother. I'm glad
[1:28:24] that I know who he is. I'm glad I
[1:28:27] understand what he meant when he said,
[1:28:29] "When you've seen the father,
[1:28:33] you've seen me." Have I been with you
[1:28:36] all this time and you didn't even know
[1:28:37] who I was? He said it. You're still
[1:28:40] looking. And I'm here. I'm here. Before
[1:28:43] Abraham was,
[1:28:46] I am. That's what Jesus said because
[1:28:50] he's given us a name. And it's by
[1:28:52] revelation that we know his name. And
[1:28:55] it's by revelation that we take his name
[1:28:57] in baptism. It's a marriage. It's not
[1:29:01] just titles or positions or offices.
[1:29:04] There is a name. And they that know thy
[1:29:08] name. Somebody said, "Well, if I'm in
[1:29:10] the Old Testament, shouldn't I call him
[1:29:12] uh uh Jehovah?" Well, you can if you
[1:29:15] like. You won't find that in the Hebrew
[1:29:17] scripture. There's great argument over
[1:29:20] how to pronounce it. Uh uh uh we won't
[1:29:23] get into that because we know how he
[1:29:25] answers.
[1:29:26] He answers to Lord Jesus Christ. I know
[1:29:30] they've called it a bastardation and all
[1:29:32] kinds of uh you know mis mis
[1:29:35] translation. I know he answers to that
[1:29:37] name. Lord Jesus Christ. I baptize you
[1:29:39] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:29:42] Aren't you going against what G? Not at
[1:29:44] all. That's exactly what he said. He's
[1:29:46] speaking to those who would have a
[1:29:48] revelation. They that know thy name will
[1:29:50] put their trust in thee, for thou Lord
[1:29:53] hath not spoken, excuse me, hath not
[1:29:55] forsaken them that seek thee. Somebody
[1:29:59] said, "I didn't think you could seek
[1:30:00] God." You can only seek him if he's
[1:30:03] seeking you. Aren't you glad that he's
[1:30:05] seeking you? Sing
[1:30:07] praises. While you folks just think
[1:30:10] praise is the answer to everything, it
[1:30:12] nearly is.
[1:30:14] Sing praises to the Lord which dwelleth
[1:30:16] in Zion. Declare among the people his
[1:30:20] doings. Isn't that what brother Dylan
[1:30:22] was doing up here this morning? Telling
[1:30:23] us that he's an ontime God. He's the
[1:30:25] same yesterday, today, and forever. You
[1:30:28] want to go somewhere with me this
[1:30:29] morning? Turn to Luke chapter
[1:30:32] 8 verse
[1:30:34] 23-2. But as they sailed, he fell
[1:30:38] asleep. And there came down a storm of
[1:30:41] wind on the lake. It's one of the most
[1:30:45] unusual bodies of water in the world.
[1:30:48] It's called in the King James version of
[1:30:51] the Bible the Sea of Galilee, but it's
[1:30:53] not really a sea. It's an inland lake.
[1:30:57] It is the Canerit in Hebrew. And uh it
[1:31:01] is an unusual lake in the sense that
[1:31:04] it's very very deep and very broad
[1:31:07] across. And even to this day, a storm
[1:31:12] can rise in the middle of the Sea of
[1:31:15] Galilee or in the middle of the Canerit
[1:31:18] and you can stand on the shore where
[1:31:20] it's 100% calm and look out to the
[1:31:23] middle and it looks nearly like a
[1:31:25] hurricane twirling out in the middle of
[1:31:28] that sea. So, I don't have any trouble
[1:31:31] imagining what this storm could have
[1:31:34] possibly looked like on the lake. And
[1:31:36] they were filled with water. The boat
[1:31:38] began to take on water and were in
[1:31:44] jeopardy. Their lives were at risk on a
[1:31:49] lake in a little boat. Their lives were
[1:31:53] in jeopardy. Somebody said, "Maybe the
[1:31:56] Bible just exaggerates this a little
[1:31:58] bit." No, their lives were in jeopardy.
[1:32:01] It was a raging storm. It was a serious
[1:32:05] situation. And so they came to
[1:32:08] him. Uh he had fallen
[1:32:12] asleep. Verse 23. But as they
[1:32:15] sailed, he fell asleep and there came
[1:32:18] down a storm of wind on the lake. They
[1:32:21] were filled with water and were in
[1:32:23] jeopardy. And they came to him and awoke
[1:32:26] him,
[1:32:27] saying, "Why don't you cry that out here
[1:32:31] with me?
[1:32:33] Master,
[1:32:35] master, we perish. They recognize the
[1:32:39] jeopardy. They recognize the danger. Why
[1:32:41] didn't he recognize it? He was sleeping.
[1:32:45] [Laughter]
[1:32:48] Every time I read that, I I I hear my
[1:32:52] granddaddy standing at the bedroom door
[1:32:55] uh uh uh hollering in the hall, "Get up.
[1:32:59] Get up. Get up." There's a storm. Get
[1:33:03] up. Get up. My grandmother's name was a
[1:33:06] pretty country name. Mildred. Mildred,
[1:33:09] get
[1:33:10] up, Tater Bug. That was
[1:33:13] me. Tater Bug, get up. Get up. There's
[1:33:18] My grandmother said, "Ralph, he's he had
[1:33:20] a country name, too.
[1:33:22] Ralph, go back to sleep,
[1:33:25] honey. It It's a tornado. It's a tornado
[1:33:29] coming and and we better get up and take
[1:33:32] cover. She said, "I've done figured this
[1:33:34] out. I'm going back to sleep tomorrow,
[1:33:37] Sunday. We've got church. We're going to
[1:33:40] worship the Lord all day. We're going to
[1:33:42] get tired. We need our rest. One of two
[1:33:45] things is going to happen."
[1:33:48] He said, "What's that? We're either
[1:33:50] going to get blown away in Jesus' name
[1:33:54] or we're going to get up in the morning
[1:33:56] and go to church in Jesus' name. And she
[1:33:59] said, "What if I told you the reality is
[1:34:01] I don't really care. It doesn't really
[1:34:04] matter to me which it is because I know
[1:34:07] that I know that I know that I know that
[1:34:11] I'm ready to go." Somebody said,
[1:34:12] "Wouldn't it be wonderful to live like
[1:34:14] that with the absence of fear?" I am
[1:34:17] here to tell you today that that is the
[1:34:20] inheritance of the bride. If you could
[1:34:23] recognize, if I could recognize who I
[1:34:26] am, there would be the absence of fear.
[1:34:30] We would recognize that he's on board.
[1:34:33] Doesn't matter whether he's sleeping or
[1:34:36] whether he's awake, he's on board.
[1:34:42] Sister West used to say, uh, "I'm scared
[1:34:45] to
[1:34:46] fly." Sister April and the kids were up
[1:34:49] just visiting Sister Wes last week and
[1:34:52] she used to say all the time, "I'm
[1:34:54] scared to fly. I'm terrified to fly. I
[1:34:57] don't like to fly." But, but she said,
[1:34:59] "I'll fly under one
[1:35:01] condition." What is that? If brother
[1:35:04] Shel's on the
[1:35:08] plane, Brother West, you know, he loved
[1:35:10] me, but he didn't like he didn't
[1:35:13] understand. He said,
[1:35:13] [Music]
[1:35:15] "Janette, that's your
[1:35:17] pastor. You know, like," she said, "No,
[1:35:20] no, no. I know that God's not through
[1:35:23] with him." She said, 'I, you know, I
[1:35:25] don't know about
[1:35:26] me, but I know God's not finished with
[1:35:29] him, and if he's on the plane, I know
[1:35:33] that it is not going
[1:35:35] down. That's what her faith was, and
[1:35:37] that's all right. And I love her, and I
[1:35:39] and it made me feel good. And and I'm
[1:35:41] going to be honest and tell you, it did.
[1:35:43] But the reality is he's on board.
[1:35:47] He's on board. He's in the midst of the
[1:35:49] storm. He's in the midst of the anxiety,
[1:35:52] the trouble. He's in the midst of the
[1:35:54] crisis. He's in the midst of the chaos.
[1:35:58] And I believe there's a people being
[1:36:00] prepared and positioned in this hour to
[1:36:04] live in the absence of fear, to live in
[1:36:07] the absence of anxiety, to live with the
[1:36:10] authority of the bridegroom.
[1:36:13] I believe it. Yes, sir. I I spent about
[1:36:17] 12 13 hours this week in one short verse
[1:36:22] of the Bible that I'm not even going to
[1:36:24] preach on this morning. In Ephesians
[1:36:26] chapter 1 verse three, I didn't know you
[1:36:29] could spend so much time in one little
[1:36:31] tiny verse, but it got bigger and better
[1:36:34] and richer to me as I kept reading it
[1:36:37] over and over again. this reality of
[1:36:40] sitting together with him
[1:36:44] in heavenly places.
[1:36:46] Oh, brother, sister, above it all.
[1:36:50] Above it all in heavenly places and and
[1:36:53] not even having to come down to go to
[1:36:55] work because it's a spiritual position
[1:37:01] with a cancer diagnosis. You don't have
[1:37:04] to come down to go and do your job. You
[1:37:07] don't have to come down because it's a
[1:37:10] spiritual positioning. It's a placement
[1:37:12] of the wheel sons, the mature sons of
[1:37:15] God. Those who used to suck the bottle,
[1:37:18] but they no longer have to suck the
[1:37:20] bottle because they have cut their teeth
[1:37:22] on the meat of the revelation of who
[1:37:25] Jesus Christ is. Not a historical
[1:37:28] figure, but the living word. Not only
[1:37:31] among us,
[1:37:36] but in us. That's our reality.
[1:37:40] I know we get disturbed
[1:37:43] daily. And you know why that happens?
[1:37:46] Because we allow it. There is a peace.
[1:37:50] Punch your neighbor. Punch them. Don't
[1:37:52] tap them. Punch
[1:37:55] them. There is a reality. There is a
[1:37:59] peace that passes.
[1:38:02] Can't explain it. It passes all
[1:38:04] understanding. Yes, sir. No way to tell
[1:38:07] you what it feels like when there's a
[1:38:09] tornado headed your way and all you do
[1:38:12] is turn your head over and lay it right
[1:38:15] back down on the pillow and know that
[1:38:17] he's God.
[1:38:20] [Applause]
[1:38:21] I'm not going to church cuz it's stormy.
[1:38:24] I'm not going to do this because the
[1:38:25] wind isn't blowing. Now, if you're
[1:38:26] elderly, you can't see to drive. I
[1:38:29] understand all that. Most of us aren't
[1:38:31] really in that position tonight. And so,
[1:38:34] I'm preaching to those of us that are
[1:38:36] looking for excuse.
[1:38:39] I said to somebody last night, "Come
[1:38:41] down and have a a little snack with us.
[1:38:44] We want you to have some fellowship and
[1:38:47] to know some of the people." And I said,
[1:38:49] "I heard you had hamburgers at home and
[1:38:51] and and so forth." And the little girl
[1:38:54] about 12 years old, I think she looked
[1:38:56] up and she said, "It's just
[1:39:01] excuses." Oh, I said, "I like
[1:39:04] you." I said, "You just tell it like it
[1:39:06] is." She Mhm. I said, "You got a little
[1:39:09] sass. I like a little sass." And her
[1:39:12] mama said, "What about too much sass
[1:39:14] sometime?" Well, I said, "There's a way
[1:39:16] to fix that.
[1:39:18] A little posterior protoplasm will take
[1:39:21] care of that. And most of the most of
[1:39:23] the time most of the situ it's it's this
[1:39:26] is the truth. It's an excuse.
[1:39:29] We make excuses to live below our means.
[1:39:33] What about somebody deciding I'm not
[1:39:35] going to make excuses for my lack of
[1:39:38] faith anymore. I'm going to find what it
[1:39:40] is that needs to be awakened in me.
[1:39:43] I'm going to find the missing piece that
[1:39:46] needs to come to life in me so that I
[1:39:49] can begin to use the authority that's
[1:39:51] mine.
[1:39:53] It's bridal inheritance.
[1:39:55] It's the inheritance of the wife.
[1:39:59] Yes, sir. I I'm I want to tell you
[1:40:02] something. Are you still here? Yes, sir.
[1:40:04] Good. They came to him and walk
[1:40:07] him, saying, "Master, master, we
[1:40:10] perish." Then he
[1:40:13] arose. Oh, you got to I want you to see
[1:40:16] him. I know that most of the time if
[1:40:20] you're watching some portrayal of
[1:40:23] Jesus, you know, the old old kind of
[1:40:26] Jesus movies with the halos over their
[1:40:28] head, you know, kind of they they look
[1:40:30] like a living uh Rembrandt painting or
[1:40:33] something and all spoke old English.
[1:40:37] But every now and again you'll find
[1:40:38] something a little more creative than
[1:40:40] that like the chosen
[1:40:43] who kind of remind it just sort of makes
[1:40:45] you see another perspective. It might
[1:40:48] not be 100% word for word but it it
[1:40:51] helps you to see. I want you to know
[1:40:52] what I see. I'm not a movie maker but
[1:40:55] can I tell you what I see? I see the
[1:40:57] Lord. I see the Lord and
[1:41:05] he master.
[1:41:10] I don't see him jumping up with the same
[1:41:13] anxiety and urgency that the disciples
[1:41:16] are operating in.
[1:41:18] I I I I see him yawning.
[1:41:24] He He's waking up. He knows there's no
[1:41:27] emergency.
[1:41:29] The only emergency that Jesus sees is
[1:41:31] the lack of faith
[1:41:34] in his disciples. And it's the same way
[1:41:37] today. Jesus sees the lack of faith in
[1:41:40] us. The gospel records or or one of the
[1:41:44] epistles perhaps never will there be
[1:41:46] faith? Will he find faith? Will there be
[1:41:48] faith in the earth?
[1:41:51] Come on.
[1:41:53] So he just, you know, he gets up and
[1:41:55] he's stretching maybe or you're adding
[1:41:56] to the word,
[1:41:58] whatever. You know, maybe maybe your God
[1:42:01] is more Billy
[1:42:03] Graham, but uh I have this feeling that
[1:42:07] he was sleepy and he was tired. And this
[1:42:10] was no fake nap. This was one of the
[1:42:12] real kind. He he probably already moved
[1:42:15] into dream cycle. This was EM sleep.
[1:42:18] This was deep sleep. He didn't even know
[1:42:21] the storm had come. He didn't even
[1:42:22] realize why. The more the boat rock, the
[1:42:24] deeper his sleep got. Why wasn't he
[1:42:27] afraid? Cuz he knew Jesus was on the
[1:42:29] boat.
[1:42:33] He knew God was in the midst.
[1:42:36] He knew that according to God's will,
[1:42:39] that is what would be done. So he just
[1:42:42] took his sleep. And so they woke him
[1:42:45] screaming, "Master, master, careest thou
[1:42:47] not that we perish?" It's so dramatic.
[1:42:49] Carest thou not that we perish? We're
[1:42:51] dying in here. Does anybody care? My
[1:42:53] head's killing me.
[1:42:56] I'm
[1:42:58] dying.
[1:43:00] Dramatic. Shakespearean almost.
[1:43:03] Dramatic. Master, master, we perish.
[1:43:07] Then he arose. We don't know how
[1:43:09] quickly. And he rebuked the wind and the
[1:43:13] raging of the water. And what happened?
[1:43:16] The storm became a calm just like the
[1:43:20] psalmist said in Psalm 107. He maketh
[1:43:23] the storm a calm. There was a calm.
[1:43:26] Verse 25. And he said unto them, red
[1:43:29] letter now, where is your
[1:43:35] faith? You
[1:43:37] are
[1:43:39] eyewitnesses of the almighty power of
[1:43:42] God.
[1:43:43] You've seen what he does and what he can
[1:43:46] do. That's right. And you've heard the
[1:43:48] stories of who he is and the track
[1:43:51] record. Where is your faith? Have you
[1:43:55] ever asked yourself the question when
[1:43:56] you caught yourself in a panic?
[1:43:59] Where is my faith? And they being afraid
[1:44:03] wondered, saying one to another, what
[1:44:05] manner of man is, the same kind of man
[1:44:09] that healed the blind, that cleans the
[1:44:12] leper, that raised the dead, same kind
[1:44:15] of man, the man that multiplied the
[1:44:18] fish, the man who, same one, same man,
[1:44:21] God man. What manner of man is this? For
[1:44:25] he commandeth even the winds and water,
[1:44:27] and they obey him. It is as though
[1:44:29] they're just discovering who he is.
[1:44:33] Now, you think about this a moment. I
[1:44:36] want you to look at uh one verse. Mark
[1:44:38] 4, same story. We're going somewhere.
[1:44:42] Verse 39. And he arose and rebuked the
[1:44:46] wind and said unto the sea, would you
[1:44:50] say that for me? Peace be still. Luke
[1:44:53] the physician does not even
[1:44:55] record what he says.
[1:45:00] There's no red letter in Luke's telling
[1:45:02] except where is your faith. Luke just
[1:45:05] simply said, "Master, we perish." He
[1:45:07] arose, rebuked the wind, and the raging
[1:45:09] of the water. They ceased. There was a
[1:45:10] calm. We have no idea what he said, but
[1:45:12] Mark, he recorded that the Lord said,
[1:45:16] "Peace be still. Peace be
[1:45:21] peace. Peace be peace. Peace be still."
[1:45:26] And the wind
[1:45:27] ceased. And what does it say?
[1:45:31] There was a great calm. How many of you
[1:45:33] believe he said, "Peace be still."
[1:45:35] Something like that. I do because it's
[1:45:37] very much his nature. It is I.
[1:45:42] It's be not afraid.
[1:45:46] Here come a ghost. They thought he had
[1:45:48] to tell him again who he was.
[1:45:51] You've already forgotten.
[1:45:54] gone a short time and you've already
[1:45:56] forgotten it is I be not afraid. So I
[1:46:00] think it's very likely that he said
[1:46:03] peace be still. Luke recorded a little
[1:46:07] different but Mark put the word peace be
[1:46:10] still and the wind ceased and there was
[1:46:12] great calm. Can you show these people
[1:46:14] what that looks like in the Greek? Uh
[1:46:15] it's all Greek to them and Greek to me
[1:46:17] and it's not going to mean anything to
[1:46:18] them but I wanted you to see. Do you see
[1:46:20] that in the Greek New Testament? Mark
[1:46:22] 4:39
[1:46:23] reads, "It looks like scratches, doesn't
[1:46:26] it? It could be Russian and you wouldn't
[1:46:28] know the difference, and neither would
[1:46:29] I, but translated literally." Do you
[1:46:32] know there are literal translations of
[1:46:34] the Bible? Sometimes they make a
[1:46:35] tremendous amount of sense, and
[1:46:37] sometimes you learn in a verse how
[1:46:39] needed prepositions are and articles and
[1:46:42] things to to connect. This is how that
[1:46:45] verse would read directly, literally
[1:46:48] translated from those scribbles and
[1:46:50] scratches. You see, and being aroused,
[1:46:54] he rebuked the wind and said to the sea,
[1:46:58] "Be silent. Be muzzled."
[1:47:04] You You know what a muzzle is?
[1:47:07] Something you put on an animal to keep
[1:47:10] the animal from biting you. Have you
[1:47:12] ever had to muzzle a dog? I've seen some
[1:47:15] dogs that couldn't be trusted,
[1:47:18] that had to be muzzled. It's also a a a
[1:47:21] farming implement. It's something that
[1:47:23] can go on so that a that a beast, an ox,
[1:47:26] a mad cow, whatever you're dealing with.
[1:47:30] There are also contraptions that can go
[1:47:32] on beasts like that to muzzle them to
[1:47:35] keep them from being able to bite or to
[1:47:38] eat.
[1:47:40] Because if they stop in the job to eat,
[1:47:44] the job will never get done. That's why
[1:47:46] scripturally the Bible said we should
[1:47:48] not muzzle the ox that treadth out the
[1:47:50] corn. There's a time to tread the corn.
[1:47:52] There's a time to feed the ox who treads
[1:47:55] the corn. Do you get it? Jesus stood up
[1:47:58] and he simply said, "Be silent. Be
[1:48:02] muzzled." And the wind ceased. And there
[1:48:04] was a great calm. That is him. That's
[1:48:07] the master. That's our Lord. That's God
[1:48:09] in flesh. What have I told you? He lives
[1:48:11] in you. He lives in me.
[1:48:15] And what we need to do is let him be
[1:48:17] aroused.
[1:48:18] Let him get up and answer the challenge
[1:48:21] instead of your emotion.
[1:48:23] Your emotion is not your enemy. It's
[1:48:26] given to you by God so that you can
[1:48:27] contact your environment. But if your
[1:48:29] emotions control you, you'll have no
[1:48:31] faith. You'll operate in no faith. But
[1:48:34] if you learn to control your emotions,
[1:48:36] you'll have better relationships and
[1:48:38] your faith will grow. If anybody
[1:48:40] believes that, say, "Amen." Amen. I'm
[1:48:42] going to muzzle my fear.
[1:48:45] I'm going to tell my fear to hush. I'm
[1:48:47] going to tell my anxiety to be silent.
[1:48:50] And then the winds of my life are going
[1:48:52] to cease and the storm will become a
[1:48:54] calm. I really believe that. I I really
[1:48:57] believe that. Surely you don't. I really
[1:49:00] really believe that. I want you to look
[1:49:02] at this with me just a moment.
[1:49:04] That that phrase peace be still. It's a
[1:49:08] little little technical here, but you
[1:49:10] don't mind. I know you
[1:49:12] don't. It's made up of two Greek
[1:49:15] words. It's made up of a word
[1:49:18] sopa which means be
[1:49:21] silent. The root and the meaning. This
[1:49:23] is the present active imperative of the
[1:49:27] word sop which means to be silent to
[1:49:32] keep quiet to hold one's peace. It's a
[1:49:38] command to cease making sound or to
[1:49:42] hush. That's a good southern word.
[1:49:46] It means shut up. Yes, sir.
[1:49:51] Mama say hush. Don't you say shut up.
[1:49:55] You just said that, mama. It means the
[1:49:58] same thing. Hush sounds perhaps a little
[1:50:02] nicer. Wait till you wait till we move a
[1:50:05] little forward. It's a command to cease
[1:50:08] making sound or hush. There is a
[1:50:11] contextual nuance
[1:50:12] here, a nuance. And in this verse, Jesus
[1:50:16] directs the word seopa, the verbal
[1:50:20] command to the sea, personifying it as
[1:50:24] something capable of obeying a verbal
[1:50:27] command. It's
[1:50:29] water. He created it, but it's water.
[1:50:33] It's living water. It has all the right
[1:50:37] molecules, right? It's
[1:50:40] H2O. It's alive. But technically, it has
[1:50:44] no brain.
[1:50:46] Technically, it has no personality.
[1:50:49] Technically, it has no ability
[1:50:53] to discern,
[1:50:55] to interpret. Just think about it a
[1:50:56] moment. I know this is odd for me, and
[1:50:58] you're looking odder.
[1:51:03] He's talking to it as
[1:51:05] though it should know what he means.
[1:51:13] He took total possession
[1:51:16] and
[1:51:17] ownership of the surroundings.
[1:51:21] He said, "You're mine.
[1:51:25] And I'm going to master this. I'm going
[1:51:28] to take dominion over this." Somebody
[1:51:30] said, "I don't believe in them positive
[1:51:32] affirmations." You might ought to if
[1:51:35] they're biblical affirmations. You might
[1:51:37] ought to prophesy over your own life.
[1:51:40] You might ought to decree and declare
[1:51:41] over your own life instead of listening
[1:51:45] instead of listening to the panic.
[1:51:46] Instead of listening to your emotion,
[1:51:48] instead of listening to the storm and
[1:51:50] listening to the chaos, you ought to do
[1:51:52] some talking.
[1:51:54] I am that I am is with me. He's in me.
[1:51:59] Yes, sir. You might have to take some
[1:52:01] authority over things that uh seem like
[1:52:04] would not even have the o ability to
[1:52:07] hear you, to obey you, to discern what
[1:52:09] you're saying. You might feel a little
[1:52:11] foolish,
[1:52:14] but you don't feel foolish talking to
[1:52:16] your
[1:52:17] dog. You don't feel foolish talking to
[1:52:19] your plant.
[1:52:22] I don't feel foolish talking to
[1:52:24] Elelliana.
[1:52:26] And I don't just mean goooo gaga
[1:52:29] pap. No, I show her every picture on the
[1:52:33] wall and I explain what's in the
[1:52:36] picture. We recently stayed in a cabin
[1:52:39] where there was a picture of a llama
[1:52:40] with flowers on her head. And I said,
[1:52:43] "Look at there, Elelliana. That is a
[1:52:46] llama. We're going to call her, no
[1:52:48] offense, Lily. We're going to call her
[1:52:50] to Lily. Lily the llama. We're going to
[1:52:52] call her Lily the llama. And she has
[1:52:54] flowers on her head. and she's a silly
[1:52:57] llama and the next thing you know a song
[1:52:59] comes and a story comes and you'd think
[1:53:02] that wouldn't mean anything to her until
[1:53:05] she fusses and then you take her back to
[1:53:08] the picture and she sees Lily the llama
[1:53:11] and she starts grunting for me to sing
[1:53:13] her the song and tell her the story. I
[1:53:16] know she's a
[1:53:19] genius, but the reality is they're
[1:53:23] capable of that.
[1:53:25] And if we feel them, why? Why? She
[1:53:27] doesn't even know. You may feel a little
[1:53:29] foolish. Have you ever stood over
[1:53:31] somebody in a coma? You didn't know
[1:53:33] whether they heard you or not, but you
[1:53:34] were willing to take a chance. I want
[1:53:37] you to know I love you. I want to say
[1:53:39] something to you. Whether you but you
[1:53:41] feel a little you feel a little silly
[1:53:42] doing it. You're not sure. Let me tell
[1:53:44] you something. We're going to have to
[1:53:46] begin to understand that there is an
[1:53:48] authority that only the creator carries.
[1:53:52] But he said, "I'm giving that I am
[1:53:54] endowing. I am releasing that to a
[1:53:57] people who are becoming mature in this
[1:53:59] hour that they might also be able to
[1:54:02] speak to their circumstances."
[1:54:06] Brother Brandham said, "If you will make
[1:54:07] the right confession,
[1:54:11] that God is able to make your body
[1:54:16] obey your confession. liver.
[1:54:20] Come on now. I've got something I want
[1:54:22] to say to you today.
[1:54:25] I know. I know. I know that for the for
[1:54:28] Christianity 101, you're never going to
[1:54:30] swallow that. But for those of us that
[1:54:33] have been through the fire, we'll talk
[1:54:35] to anything.
[1:54:39] Toenail, I'm tired of you hurting me.
[1:54:41] Come on now.
[1:54:43] When you have been in this thing for a
[1:54:45] while, you will begin to understand that
[1:54:48] no problem is too big and no problem is
[1:54:51] too small to put Jesus on the case. He
[1:54:54] can make a storm a calm. He can bring
[1:54:58] healing to an ingrown toenail.
[1:55:02] He cares about it. Somebody said, "It's
[1:55:04] just a headache." Don't just a headache.
[1:55:08] A headache can be de debilitating. A
[1:55:11] headache can be nauseating. A headache
[1:55:13] can send you to bed in a dark room. But
[1:55:16] I know the master of the headache.
[1:55:19] I know the master of inflammation. I
[1:55:22] know the master of arthritis.
[1:55:26] I know the master.
[1:55:28] And if I'll just remember who I am and
[1:55:31] use the authority that is brother B
[1:55:33] said, we don't need more power. That's
[1:55:35] right.
[1:55:37] Jesus said, "I give you all the power."
[1:55:42] He said to his disciples, "I give you
[1:55:44] all power. Behold, I give you all power.
[1:55:47] It's in your hands." Come on. But they
[1:55:51] couldn't operate in the fullness of that
[1:55:52] power because they didn't have a
[1:55:54] complete revelation of their authority.
[1:55:57] If just one of those disciples,
[1:56:01] if just one of them would have said,
[1:56:02] "Let's don't bother him.
[1:56:07] Let's let him nap. They didn't love his
[1:56:09] flesh. Not yet. They hadn't got to that
[1:56:12] place yet. To them, a nap is nothing.
[1:56:17] We're perishing. We're taking on water.
[1:56:21] We're dying. And he don't care.
[1:56:24] If we go down, he ought not to be able
[1:56:26] to be sleeping while we're going
[1:56:29] down. Come on.
[1:56:31] If just one of them would have stood up
[1:56:33] and said, "I'm going to try this
[1:56:38] wind
[1:56:40] storm in the name of Jesus."
[1:56:45] Somebody said they didn't have a
[1:56:46] revelation. Well, they did get one at
[1:56:48] some point. I don't know when it came,
[1:56:50] but somebody got a revelation. Maybe it
[1:56:53] hadn't come to them yet. Maybe they
[1:56:55] hadn't really faced the reality of it
[1:56:57] yet. But if one of them would have stood
[1:57:00] up and taken authority in the name of
[1:57:01] Jesus, in the authority of Jesus Christ,
[1:57:04] they already had the power. He gave them
[1:57:06] power. They had authority. They just
[1:57:08] didn't understand yet how it was to
[1:57:10] operate. And if one of them would have
[1:57:12] taken authority over that storm, that
[1:57:13] whole verse, that whole story would have
[1:57:15] read different. Can you imagine?
[1:57:19] and uh you know whoever James or John or
[1:57:24] who and John rose up and said peace be
[1:57:30] still and the winds and waves obeyed his
[1:57:34] command. Somebody said I don't believe I
[1:57:36] don't even want to want to try to make
[1:57:38] conjecture. I don't even want to try to
[1:57:39] sort that in my mind because I don't
[1:57:41] believe that's the way it is. Well,
[1:57:42] folks, that's our problem. We don't
[1:57:45] understand the authority that has been
[1:57:47] given to us. Somebody said, "Well, I've
[1:57:49] tried it and it didn't work before."
[1:57:50] Line up your life. Let your life line
[1:57:52] up. Make a little effort. Make sure
[1:57:55] there's no dead cats on the line. Make
[1:57:57] sure there's no unrepented sin in your
[1:57:59] life. Make sure you've been baptized in
[1:58:01] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Make
[1:58:02] sure you have the baptism of the Holy
[1:58:04] Ghost. The one who walks and talks. The
[1:58:07] one who's ever more alive. The one that
[1:58:08] causes you to have strength to live
[1:58:10] above sin. The one that deals with
[1:58:13] temptation in your life. That Holy
[1:58:15] Ghost. That one. That one. That one
[1:58:17] that'll take you out of yourself and
[1:58:18] plunge you in the realm of spirit.
[1:58:21] The one that can rescue you from your
[1:58:23] own flesh and put you in a dimension of
[1:58:25] supernatural existence. Come on. That
[1:58:28] one that we need him. We need the Holy
[1:58:31] Ghost. Not a feeling, not an emotion,
[1:58:33] not a thrill. We need the person.
[1:58:37] The reality of Jesus Christ. Let that
[1:58:39] come. It's ours. It's promised. My whole
[1:58:43] family think I lost my mind. They don't
[1:58:45] think you've lost your mind when you're
[1:58:46] running from room to room pulling the
[1:58:48] drapes and closing the blinds because a
[1:58:51] tornado's
[1:58:54] coming. They they think that's normal.
[1:58:57] Do you all think that's normal to close
[1:58:59] the the curtains because a tornado's
[1:59:03] coming? Maybe maybe it slows the glass
[1:59:07] down, but anything I've seen about a
[1:59:09] tornado, right? It doesn't come all the
[1:59:12] way up to your
[1:59:14] Walmart panels and
[1:59:18] stop. And it doesn't come up and say,
[1:59:20] "That's TJ Maxx. I'm not going any
[1:59:22] further than that. I know where that
[1:59:23] come
[1:59:24] from." It just blows right curtains and
[1:59:27] all, windows and all. Come on. We get
[1:59:29] really silly sometimes.
[1:59:32] I've seen people do it. I've seen people
[1:59:33] do it. I've seen people find the most
[1:59:35] dangerous place in the house and think
[1:59:37] that that's the place they need to be.
[1:59:38] Let me tell you something. There's a
[1:59:39] bomb shelter. There's a storm shelter.
[1:59:44] There's a well.
[1:59:46] There is a source for everything that we
[1:59:47] have need of. I'm not telling you not to
[1:59:49] use wisdom. I'm not telling you not to
[1:59:51] do practical things to help protect
[1:59:53] yourself. I'm not telling you not to get
[1:59:54] a candle out of the drawer and get ready
[1:59:56] in case. But what I am telling you is
[1:59:59] you have a perfect We live in the south.
[2:00:01] We live in a place where storms brew all
[2:00:03] the time. When you came to church today,
[2:00:05] I didn't dare want you all to know
[2:00:06] unless you got the same notification. We
[2:00:08] were already under a tornado watch,
[2:00:10] right? We've had so many storms lately.
[2:00:13] We're all watching for them.
[2:00:16] And predicted them whether they're and
[2:00:18] and so I saw yesterday terrible storm
[2:00:21] weather threat for tomorrow. And I
[2:00:24] opened the article and it says we so far
[2:00:27] we are at a two out of five for
[2:00:31] tomorrow. How many of you know that
[2:00:33] means very little
[2:00:35] because the storm doesn't know its
[2:00:36] number? Right.
[2:00:40] Did you know the tornado doesn't know if
[2:00:42] you're under a watch or a warning?
[2:00:44] But there's somebody on board. I hope
[2:00:47] you're not making fun of me, Brother
[2:00:48] Shel. I'm not making fun of you. But I
[2:00:51] will tell you this. As my mother's
[2:00:53] dementia began to progress, her fears
[2:00:56] got littleer, not bigger.
[2:01:01] My mama was the one. She was the one.
[2:01:03] Her mother was worse. Her mother was the
[2:01:06] one they would put us in the bathtub
[2:01:09] with a mattress on our
[2:01:12] heads. Like school, we mentioned it the
[2:01:14] other day, school with a textbook on our
[2:01:16] head. Like the textbook was going to
[2:01:18] keep the roof off of
[2:01:20] us. Come on. We were just doing what we
[2:01:24] knew. My poor mother was turning the
[2:01:28] sofa over and getting under the sofa
[2:01:31] when a storm came by. But as she began
[2:01:35] to lose
[2:01:37] some of that ability to process all of
[2:01:41] that fear that had ruled her life,
[2:01:48] Benjamin would say to her mom, "There's
[2:01:49] supposed to be a sto." Oh,
[2:01:51] okay. May turn bad, maybe bad weather
[2:01:54] later. Oh, all
[2:01:55] right. And he'd think, "Is that my mom?"
[2:02:00] There has to be a
[2:02:01] reason that she not only forgot certain
[2:02:05] details of her life in the beginning,
[2:02:07] but she also began to forget her fears.
[2:02:12] Which proves that those fears were wired
[2:02:15] into her mind as memories. And as she
[2:02:18] began to forget memories, her memories
[2:02:19] begin to fade. Her fears begin to fade.
[2:02:22] Is there anybody in here that wants to
[2:02:23] wait until dementia
[2:02:25] to forget your
[2:02:27] fear? Or is there somebody in here
[2:02:29] that's going to begin to say, "Wait a
[2:02:30] minute. I've been really living under
[2:02:33] some pressure here."
[2:02:36] You know, you get a symptom and you
[2:02:37] Google it and you know that that you
[2:02:40] only have a short time to live.
[2:02:43] That's fearful. It'll run you out of
[2:02:45] your head.
[2:02:47] I went to the doctor and he told me what
[2:02:48] was wrong with me. Maybe, maybe he did,
[2:02:51] maybe he
[2:02:52] didn't. He's practicing medicine. It's
[2:02:55] getting quiet in here. I'm not against
[2:02:57] doctors. I have one. They've been
[2:02:59] begging me now for weeks. You aren't you
[2:03:01] going to come back? Didn't Didn't you
[2:03:03] need us? Do you need Don't you need
[2:03:05] refills? Won't you reschedule? They're
[2:03:07] after you all the time. They want you to
[2:03:09] come once a year for a wellness visit
[2:03:11] because your insurance will pay for it.
[2:03:13] You mean I have to come over there, stop
[2:03:15] my life, to come and tell you I'm
[2:03:17] okay because you get a $100 for it? Did
[2:03:21] you know that I was told that if I
[2:03:23] didn't make that appointment, I would no
[2:03:24] longer be a patient? That $100 means so
[2:03:28] much to them that if I don't show up
[2:03:30] because I'm well and don't want to go
[2:03:31] tell them how well I am.
[2:03:35] They're practicing.
[2:03:37] Sometimes they know. I've noticed the
[2:03:39] older we get, the more we give our
[2:03:41] doctors deity level. They're almost like
[2:03:44] God. Yeah. Whatever they say goes. I
[2:03:47] believe in doctors. I believe that we
[2:03:49] need medicine. I believe that's all
[2:03:50] right. But I want you to know what we
[2:03:52] don't need. We don't need fear. We don't
[2:03:55] need panic. We don't need anxiety. Great
[2:03:58] peace have they. Come on. Peace of God.
[2:04:01] Peace be still.
[2:04:03] Muzzle.
[2:04:05] Storm. I'm muzzling you right now. I'm
[2:04:08] closing my ears.
[2:04:10] I know the one who makes the storm a
[2:04:12] calm. Are you there? You still with me?
[2:04:16] I need to stay with my notes.
[2:04:18] it'll help
[2:04:20] us. So, here are the words. This this
[2:04:23] contextual nuance Jesus directs this
[2:04:26] Greek word here uh sciopa. He directs it
[2:04:30] with a verbal command. The word doesn't
[2:04:33] just
[2:04:34] imply, a gentle request for quiet. It is
[2:04:38] an authorative
[2:04:40] order reflecting Jesus dominion over
[2:04:45] nature. This aligns with other uses of
[2:04:48] the same word in the New Testament. One,
[2:04:51] for instance, talks about if the if the
[2:04:54] stones are the stones will cry out if
[2:04:57] the
[2:04:59] people are calm or quiet or silent. In
[2:05:05] Greek literature and in the Septuagent,
[2:05:07] which is the Greek translation of the
[2:05:09] Old Testament, silence often carries a
[2:05:11] sense of submission or reverence, such
[2:05:14] as in Habach 2:20, the Lord is in his
[2:05:16] holy temple. Let all the earth keep
[2:05:18] silence before him. It's the same word
[2:05:21] here. Jesus commands evokes his command
[2:05:26] evokes the same sense of authority
[2:05:29] silencing the chaotic sea as if it were
[2:05:33] a
[2:05:34] subordinate like a master would speak to
[2:05:37] a
[2:05:39] servant and the servant would obey what
[2:05:42] the master said. It never occurred to
[2:05:45] Jesus the possibility uh the potential
[2:05:49] that the wind wouldn't hear him.
[2:05:52] It was never a fear. It was never an
[2:05:54] inferiority. It was never a what if. He
[2:05:57] knew that he had been given the
[2:06:00] authority and the dominion. He knew that
[2:06:02] the water could not discern and the wind
[2:06:06] could not discern. It did not have the
[2:06:08] intelligence to do it. But he knew that
[2:06:10] because it was created, it would
[2:06:12] recognize supernaturally, not naturally,
[2:06:15] supernaturally, it would recognize the
[2:06:17] voice of the creator.
[2:06:20] Yes, sir. The prophet tells us that the
[2:06:22] final voice of God to the age will be
[2:06:25] the voice of the bridegroom
[2:06:27] in the bride. In the bride. The voice of
[2:06:30] the bridegroom
[2:06:32] in the bride. Whose voice is going to
[2:06:35] talk to the trouble? The bridegroom's
[2:06:37] voice. That's his authority. That's what
[2:06:40] it's talking about. I want to see some
[2:06:43] miracles.
[2:06:44] I want to see some miracles in this
[2:06:46] house. I want to see some chronic
[2:06:48] conditions go. I want to see some people
[2:06:51] that have suffered for years wait it out
[2:06:54] and move in this place of authority and
[2:06:58] come back. I I have I've lived under the
[2:07:00] burden of this infirmity my whole life,
[2:07:02] but I'm made whole. I am 100% made
[2:07:05] whole.
[2:07:08] Well, what did what happened? What? I
[2:07:09] guess brother so and so prayed for you.
[2:07:11] I guess this one prayed for you and saw
[2:07:12] a vision and everything turned out all
[2:07:14] right. know I just made up my mind
[2:07:17] that I had authority in his name by his
[2:07:20] blood with his word. I had authority to
[2:07:24] make my storm.
[2:07:29] Until we learn that, we actually become
[2:07:32] storm magnets.
[2:07:35] Until we learn who we are and who under
[2:07:37] whose authority we operate, we actually
[2:07:39] become a magnet for troubles, for trials
[2:07:41] and chaos. Have you ever seen anybody
[2:07:44] that seem to just attract chaos and
[2:07:46] confusion and so forth? That's a person
[2:07:48] that hasn't discovered who they are in
[2:07:49] Christ.
[2:07:53] And so they just draw it in. They just
[2:07:55] attract it wherever they go. That kind
[2:07:57] of stuff just follows them. You let that
[2:07:59] person know. The prophet tells us
[2:08:01] there's great value in knowing who you
[2:08:04] are in Christ. One of these days, he
[2:08:06] said, that bride,
[2:08:08] she's going to recognize who she is.
[2:08:11] Amen. She's going to silence this
[2:08:14] greatest battle. Amen. She's going to
[2:08:16] pull her emotions down. She's going to
[2:08:18] silence the lie. Come on. She's going to
[2:08:21] talk to the fear. And she's going to
[2:08:23] live for a period of time. We don't know
[2:08:25] how long. But living under this place of
[2:08:28] glory.
[2:08:30] [Music]
[2:08:32] Less of me, more of you.
[2:08:36] I need your
[2:08:38] glory. I need it in me. I need it on me.
[2:08:41] I need it around me.
[2:08:44] I need the storm to be a calm.
[2:08:48] Let's look at the other part of that, if
[2:08:50] you will. The other part of that phrase,
[2:08:52] peace be still, is
[2:08:54] peamoso. And it means be muzzled. So
[2:08:58] really, he's saying uh silence be
[2:09:01] silent, muzzle be muzzled, peace be
[2:09:04] peace.
[2:09:06] It's a perfect passive imperative of the
[2:09:08] word which means to muzzle, to silence,
[2:09:10] or to restrain. The perfect tense in
[2:09:12] Greek often implies a completed action
[2:09:14] with ongoing
[2:09:16] results. I thought that was worth
[2:09:18] mentioning.
[2:09:20] He said, "Peace be peace." And don't
[2:09:22] only be peace right now. Our journey, we
[2:09:24] we're going to still journey to the
[2:09:26] other side. So don't just shut up now.
[2:09:30] Hold your peace. Back out of this
[2:09:33] assignment.
[2:09:36] Let this be a continual piece. Let it
[2:09:39] start and then let it be ongoing. So
[2:09:42] this could be understood. Be
[2:09:44] muzzled storm and do what? Stay that
[2:09:49] way.
[2:09:51] Nerves anxiety. I'm just
[2:09:56] Are you making fun? No, I'm actually not
[2:09:59] making fun because I've lived under it.
[2:10:05] At one time in my young life before I
[2:10:08] married, I was on medication for
[2:10:10] it. So I know what panic attacks can do.
[2:10:13] And I know what anxiety can do. And I
[2:10:16] know what unhealthy fears can do,
[2:10:18] outlandish fears. Fears of things that
[2:10:21] that that have no ability to harm you,
[2:10:24] destroy you in any way. And the enemy
[2:10:26] would cause you to be afraid. It's it's
[2:10:28] a very it's a very few very rare very
[2:10:31] few spiders in this whole wide
[2:10:36] world. Granddaddy longlegs, they are not
[2:10:39] going to bite you and swallow you and
[2:10:42] eat you. They're not going to do it. You
[2:10:44] are not going to find yourself ever in
[2:10:46] your lifetime in the belly of a
[2:10:47] granddaddy longlegs. Say amen.
[2:10:51] Not a Japanese beetle either. Not a bee,
[2:10:54] brother Billy. Let's Let's speak up for
[2:10:55] the bees.
[2:10:57] No honeybee is going to eat you and
[2:10:59] swallow you.
[2:11:01] Our fears become so exaggerated at
[2:11:04] times. Brother Brandham learned that
[2:11:08] there is a remedy for fear. When perfect
[2:11:12] love projects,
[2:11:14] grace takes the case. Grace takes over.
[2:11:17] Here's a raging bull that's killed a
[2:11:19] man. Brother Brandon finds himself
[2:11:21] accidentally out in the field of this
[2:11:23] raging bull and here he comes.
[2:11:27] What would you and I have done? We would
[2:11:28] have run like a rodeo
[2:11:31] clown. We'd have been looking for the
[2:11:33] barrel. What did brother Brandway just
[2:11:36] talk to? Excuse me, Mr.
[2:11:38] Bull. I think that's silly. You may now,
[2:11:44] but it's not.
[2:11:47] Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to come
[2:11:48] trapesing through I'm paraphrasing. I
[2:11:51] didn't mean to come traping through your
[2:11:52] territory here, disturbing you on this
[2:11:54] fine
[2:11:55] day. Excuse me, hornets. I I didn't mean
[2:12:00] to to bump your nest when I was cutting
[2:12:02] the grass.
[2:12:05] I I'm not your
[2:12:06] enemy. I didn't come here to to harm you
[2:12:10] in any way. He just loved them. He
[2:12:13] personified them
[2:12:16] and he loved them and he spoke to them.
[2:12:19] And what do they do? They may not
[2:12:22] respond to anger and they may not
[2:12:26] respond to swatting. Not in a positive
[2:12:29] way, but they know what love is.
[2:12:33] Somebody said, "How is that possible?"
[2:12:35] Because they know the creator. We may
[2:12:38] not understand it, but they know the
[2:12:41] creator. If the cows get away from the
[2:12:44] stone walls in India when the
[2:12:46] earthquakes are coming. If the birds
[2:12:49] come out of the rock walls because the
[2:12:52] troubles are coming. Somebody something
[2:12:55] is communicating that.
[2:12:58] Oh my.
[2:13:01] Someone
[2:13:02] observed Sadu Sundar
[2:13:08] Singh on a rock in the
[2:13:12] night talking to the
[2:13:14] creator. And here come the two
[2:13:17] leopards that had terrorized the
[2:13:20] village, that had taken
[2:13:22] lives. They come and sit down with him
[2:13:26] on the rock and he strokes their
[2:13:32] fur like those demon cats. You all like
[2:13:36] those little kitty cats. He just treated
[2:13:39] that dead deathly leopard deadly leopard
[2:13:43] just like a little kitty cat. just
[2:13:45] stroked it like that. Somebody said,
[2:13:46] "That's a mighty, holy man." No, that is
[2:13:49] a man who had somehow found a place that
[2:13:52] he could trust the authority that God
[2:13:54] gives to the simple believer. You and I
[2:13:56] can have that authority. It's ours. It's
[2:13:58] ours. Our name is already on it. You
[2:14:01] have the ability to make your storm a
[2:14:03] calm by the way you react to it.
[2:14:07] What if I don't see an immediate result?
[2:14:10] Believe. Don't doubt. Keep the faith.
[2:14:13] Keep your praise on.
[2:14:16] Be consistent. Come right back and speak
[2:14:18] to it again.
[2:14:21] You know, the enemy thinks you'll change
[2:14:23] your mind tomorrow when things don't
[2:14:24] shift immediately. So, he'll do anything
[2:14:27] he can to to hold on as long as he
[2:14:29] possibly can because he knows our he
[2:14:31] knows how you and I don't stick with
[2:14:33] anything. You know, he knows that by
[2:14:36] January the 15th, we've forgotten all of
[2:14:38] our vows for January, for the new year.
[2:14:40] He knows that. He knows how human nature
[2:14:43] operates and he's just waiting to see if
[2:14:46] you'll believe tomorrow what you say you
[2:14:47] believe today. How many of you believe
[2:14:49] we can come to a place where our faith
[2:14:51] is even stronger tomorrow than it is
[2:14:53] today and we hadn't even seen the
[2:14:55] results of it yet. Then how can your
[2:14:57] faith grow? Because you start rehearsing
[2:14:59] what you have seen God do. I saw what he
[2:15:04] did such and such. I know what he did
[2:15:07] such and such. I remember when he did at
[2:15:11] a certain certain time your faith starts
[2:15:14] growing then and you start deciding I'm
[2:15:17] ready for my storm to become a calm I'm
[2:15:20] ready to redefine my state of mind I'm
[2:15:23] ready to put a muzzle
[2:15:28] I'm not going to stand here and let the
[2:15:29] enemy strike at me like brother Dwayne
[2:15:31] preached last night once it poison me a
[2:15:33] little bit at a time I'm going to get
[2:15:36] away I'm going to get away somehow Now,
[2:15:38] I'm going to take authority. I'm going
[2:15:40] to find a way out of this stuff. Are you
[2:15:42] here? Let's see. It's 111. Oh, I got
[2:15:44] some. You're rushing me and I have
[2:15:48] time. Be muzzled and stay that way. That
[2:15:52] root word there, fimos, refers to a
[2:15:54] muzzle or a
[2:15:55] gag. I'm putting a gag in your mouth,
[2:15:58] you lying devil of hell. I'm not
[2:16:01] listening to you anymore. You rage
[2:16:02] against the truth and the reality of
[2:16:04] Jesus Christ. I'm I'm talking to you
[2:16:07] now.
[2:16:08] the contextual nuance of the word and
[2:16:11] how the word is used in context here
[2:16:14] commands silence. It intensifies it with
[2:16:17] the imagery of binding or restraining as
[2:16:19] one might muzzle a wild animal. This is
[2:16:22] no soft plea for
[2:16:25] calm. Jesus isn't saying, you know, it
[2:16:28] would really be lovely if you would go
[2:16:30] back into your regular behavior so that
[2:16:33] we can get to the other side. That's how
[2:16:35] we think he talked.
[2:16:39] because that's what the Catholic Church
[2:16:40] represents him to be almost a
[2:16:47] But I know that I know the one who
[2:16:49] planted the whip. And said, "I'm just
[2:16:51] about tired of the way you religious
[2:16:53] people behave yourself in my father's
[2:16:55] house."
[2:16:58] You've let your religion steal your
[2:16:59] relationship and I'm here to do
[2:17:01] something about it. I'm here to turn
[2:17:02] over a table. Come on. That's the same
[2:17:04] God. That's the same God that said,
[2:17:06] "Father, forgive them." They don't know
[2:17:07] what they're doing. That's the same God.
[2:17:08] Are you here? This was a forceful
[2:17:11] subjugation of the storm's power. The
[2:17:14] sea isn't just
[2:17:15] quieted. It's rendered powerless.
[2:17:19] It's tamed by the words of Jesus. It has
[2:17:22] no choice, no option, no alternative. It
[2:17:26] must obey.
[2:17:28] Because when the creator speaks to the
[2:17:30] storm,
[2:17:34] it has to
[2:17:35] hush. There are broader implications
[2:17:37] here. We don't have time to go into all
[2:17:39] of it, but I love every piece of it. The
[2:17:41] broader implications of peace be still
[2:17:43] as a translation. The English rendering
[2:17:45] softens the original Greek somewhat.
[2:17:47] Peace often in Greek, but it's not used
[2:17:51] here. This is a different form of the
[2:17:53] word peace. It suggests harmony or
[2:17:56] tranquility. the other word, while be
[2:17:58] still, the word that's used here, uh uh
[2:18:01] the other word implies a gentle calming.
[2:18:03] However, these words are
[2:18:06] sharper. They're more commanding. What
[2:18:09] if I told you that in the
[2:18:12] Greek, and that's all we've got to work
[2:18:16] with? It would be more like shut up and
[2:18:20] stay
[2:18:22] down. You know, your words don't have to
[2:18:25] be ugly.
[2:18:26] And they don't have to be rough when you
[2:18:28] know the authority that you have. Right?
[2:18:30] True. So, I'm not trying to make it look
[2:18:32] like Jesus was just raging and mad. He
[2:18:34] wasn't at all. But he spoke with such a
[2:18:37] voice of command. Hold your peace.
[2:18:41] Shut up. Stay
[2:18:43] calm. Or my little disciples
[2:18:47] here are going to throw themselves
[2:18:49] overboard in a
[2:18:52] panic. Where's your faith? And he turns
[2:18:54] to them immediately. come everything.
[2:18:56] Where's your
[2:18:58] faith? Don't you know what God is
[2:19:01] capable of doing?
[2:19:03] Have you How many of you have ever seen
[2:19:05] him healed? How many of you have ever
[2:19:07] been healed?
[2:19:09] And don't we panic when a new symptom
[2:19:11] arises?
[2:19:13] He's a healer. I'm not getting all the
[2:19:16] help I need, but that's all right. He's
[2:19:18] a healer. He's a healer. He's a healer.
[2:19:21] He's a deliverer. Shut up and stay calm.
[2:19:24] This reflects the urgency and power of
[2:19:26] the moment. You put these words
[2:19:28] together. You put these two words
[2:19:30] together. Uh peace be
[2:19:34] peace. Tranquility be
[2:19:37] tranquility. It's like Jesus saying
[2:19:39] verily verily. It's a double
[2:19:41] emphasis. He was addressing directly the
[2:19:46] situation. His language reflected the
[2:19:49] authority. Peace be still. Jesus didn't
[2:19:54] pray. Our father, creator of all that is
[2:19:57] good and holy, we come to you today
[2:20:01] asking that you would give some help to
[2:20:04] my poor struggling disciples and that
[2:20:07] you would create a calmer environment
[2:20:10] for us to make our transition to the
[2:20:12] other side. No prayer, no addressing of
[2:20:15] the
[2:20:16] divine, no ending of the prayer. And the
[2:20:19] saint said, All right. He didn't turn
[2:20:22] around. And the saint said, and the
[2:20:24] disciples said, and the panicking
[2:20:26] fellows said
[2:20:28] none of that. He didn't pray. He
[2:20:31] declared.
[2:20:34] He commanded.
[2:20:36] Oh my. That's one of the most common
[2:20:38] ways that Jesus ministered. Using words
[2:20:40] to exercise authority over demons, over
[2:20:43] disease, over nature. Speaking words to
[2:20:46] bring healing, deliverance, and
[2:20:47] miracles. The word of God, little bride,
[2:20:50] is nigh thee. It is even in thy mouth.
[2:20:54] That's right. It's here. You see, the
[2:20:57] reality is Jesus doesn't sweat the small
[2:20:59] stuff.
[2:21:01] He doesn't get excited over waves. When
[2:21:04] the storm is at its worst, he's as calm
[2:21:07] as he can be. He was still on board.
[2:21:10] He's still on the throne. He rebuked the
[2:21:13] storm, spoke peace to them.
[2:21:16] The Did you really
[2:21:18] realize that the storm he was talking
[2:21:23] to wasn't just the natural expression?
[2:21:28] It was the storm within them. Master,
[2:21:30] master, we
[2:21:32] perish. Don't you
[2:21:34] care? We thought you loved us. That's
[2:21:37] the storm that needs to be spoken to
[2:21:39] today. Oh, I knew. Listen, I knew that
[2:21:42] it wouldn't be easy to get this out. I
[2:21:44] knew that it wouldn't quite fit in in
[2:21:46] the in the in the expectation, but I
[2:21:48] want you to know I was fully convinced
[2:21:51] when I left the house this morning that
[2:21:53] somebody would hear this who desperately
[2:21:56] absolutely needed it. And I and I, as
[2:21:59] I'm praying and I feel that impression,
[2:22:01] I thought, well, Lord, maybe Monday,
[2:22:02] maybe Tuesday, maybe there's somebody
[2:22:04] that needs it right now. There's
[2:22:06] somebody that needs it today. There's
[2:22:07] somebody that's going to realize before
[2:22:09] you go to bed tonight that a storm has
[2:22:11] risen on your lake.
[2:22:15] And your master seems to be asleep
[2:22:17] because he could be doing something
[2:22:19] about it, but he doesn't seem to be
[2:22:20] doing something about it. Somebody said,
[2:22:22] "I was praying." Were you praying or
[2:22:24] were you begging?
[2:22:26] Were you approaching him as an orphan or
[2:22:28] a son?
[2:22:30] I hear religious prayers sometime that
[2:22:32] sound more to
[2:22:34] me like an orphan
[2:22:37] desperately looking for a daddy
[2:22:39] Warbucks. Come on. A little Annie
[2:22:42] somewhere that needs a savior.
[2:22:45] Not a bride that has already found what
[2:22:48] she was looking for. A and the reality
[2:22:51] is you didn't find him. He found you.
[2:22:55] You were the one lost. And he came
[2:22:58] looking for you. He found you in your
[2:23:00] sin. He found you in your bondage. He
[2:23:02] found you in your addiction. You think
[2:23:05] he's going to leave you now? You think
[2:23:07] he's going to forsake you now?
[2:23:09] Hello.
[2:23:13] Never. Never. Sometimes we feel trapped
[2:23:15] on a boat in the middle of a storm
[2:23:17] tossed sea. The waves of life are
[2:23:19] knocking us to and fro. You peer into
[2:23:21] the darkness, hoping to see an end of
[2:23:23] the storm, but all you see is more gray
[2:23:25] skies and more gray skies and more angry
[2:23:28] waves and it seems like every day a new
[2:23:31] element of chaos is added to the storm.
[2:23:34] But if you recognize that Jesus is in
[2:23:37] your boat, the master of the universe is
[2:23:40] in your vessel. He can be asleep and you
[2:23:43] are still safe.
[2:23:46] That's good. I'm convinced that they
[2:23:48] could have pulled up a pillow.
[2:23:51] Yeah. Come on.
[2:23:54] And made it safely to the other side.
[2:23:57] You mean nobody praying, nobody
[2:23:59] rebuking, nobody taking a thought?
[2:24:01] Absolutely.
[2:24:04] I believe those disciples could have,
[2:24:05] but if they had have, you and I wouldn't
[2:24:08] have recognized ourselves in the story.
[2:24:14] But now we can.
[2:24:18] Little old Betty Jean Robinson, she's
[2:24:20] dead now. She wrote hundreds of songs. A
[2:24:22] lot of them sounded exactly the
[2:24:25] same, but she definitely was a
[2:24:28] psalmist. and she wrote this little
[2:24:30] song, this little chorus that that's
[2:24:32] been pretty helpful to me in
[2:24:35] time. It it just says, "God's got
[2:24:37] everything under
[2:24:39] control. I can sleep like a baby. I've
[2:24:42] got peace in my soul because God's got
[2:24:46] everything under control." Sometimes he
[2:24:49] doesn't let us sleep because he wants us
[2:24:50] to pray.
[2:24:52] There are other times we stay awake
[2:24:54] because we're worrying,
[2:24:56] because we're tossed and torn and our
[2:24:58] mind is raging and racing and we forget.
[2:25:00] Laying right there in the bed with us is
[2:25:03] the master of every circumstance. Hello.
[2:25:07] The voice of all voices,
[2:25:10] the author, the voice of ultimate
[2:25:12] authority. He's right there with us.
[2:25:16] Hallelujah.
[2:25:17] Hallelujah.
[2:25:19] So, I don't know which storm is is more
[2:25:21] profound. If it was the one on the
[2:25:23] outside of the boat, if it was the one
[2:25:24] on the inside of the boat, but Jesus won
[2:25:26] them all. He spoke peace to all of them.
[2:25:29] Jesus's plan for our lives does not
[2:25:31] include just calming storms all the
[2:25:33] time. He He's got a lot more uh look at
[2:25:36] the rebuke. He turned around to him and
[2:25:38] said, "Where's your faith?
[2:25:40] Why aren't you doing this?" Jesus only
[2:25:42] rebuked people who are afraid in his
[2:25:43] presence.
[2:25:51] Did you
[2:25:52] notice here come the little woman guilty
[2:25:55] of the act of adultery? He didn't rebuke
[2:25:57] her. He loved her and forgave her. Why?
[2:26:01] Because she had come to the right place.
[2:26:04] Her fear was of man, not of him. She
[2:26:06] recognized immediately that he had come
[2:26:08] to help her. They'd come to kill her.
[2:26:09] He'd come to help her. She wasn't even
[2:26:11] afraid. She was reverent. So there was
[2:26:14] no rebuke for her. He turned and rebuked
[2:26:16] the accusers. Isn't that interesting?
[2:26:19] Are you still here?
[2:26:21] He just rebuked the But there are some
[2:26:24] places in the scripture that he did
[2:26:25] bring a rebuke. And every time it was to
[2:26:27] someone who was fearful in his presence.
[2:26:31] Fearful in his presence. There's no
[2:26:34] reason to be
[2:26:35] fearful when we're in his presence.
[2:26:39] So does that mean when we're in church
[2:26:40] or does it mean all the time, every day?
[2:26:43] Is he always with us? Is he only with us
[2:26:45] when we meet corporately? Is he always
[2:26:47] with us? You let me know what you
[2:26:49] believe. Isaiah 41:10, "Fear thou not,
[2:26:52] for I am with thee. Be not dismayed, for
[2:26:54] I am thy God. I will strengthen thee.
[2:26:56] Yay, I will help thee. Yay, I will
[2:26:57] uphold thee with the right hand of my
[2:26:59] righteousness." Is that for anybody
[2:27:01] here? Does anybody believe it'll work
[2:27:02] for you? We forget so often who's
[2:27:06] sailing with us through these terrible
[2:27:08] storms of life. Amen.
[2:27:12] in the message uh calling Jesus on the
[2:27:15] scene and I'm nearly done and I didn't
[2:27:17] even I haven't even got to the
[2:27:19] punchline. That's okay. Paragraph
[2:27:22] 105. Now notice God will make our bodies
[2:27:26] obey him that he said in St. John the
[2:27:29] 6th chapter, he that eats my flesh and
[2:27:30] drinks my blood has everlasting life and
[2:27:33] I will raise him up at the last day.
[2:27:34] Think of it. Our bodies
[2:27:38] obey when we have no more control of it.
[2:27:42] turns back to a spoonful of dust. God
[2:27:44] will speak to that
[2:27:46] body and it'll rise
[2:27:50] up again in the likeness of the
[2:27:52] resurrected Jesus Christ. Do you believe
[2:27:54] that? What are you worrying about this?
[2:27:58] If it's in the hands of
[2:28:00] God, let go.
[2:28:02] Amen. For he will raise it up in the
[2:28:05] last day. Death is no big
[2:28:08] deal. He promised to do it. That's thus
[2:28:10] sayaith the Lord. It's written in his
[2:28:12] word. What are you scared about this
[2:28:14] then? This little old ship. He's in it.
[2:28:18] If he isn't in it, don't leave tonight
[2:28:20] until he comes in. It's a dangerous
[2:28:22] thing to try to sail without him. Amen.
[2:28:25] He said you'll be sunk. Sure, but you
[2:28:27] can't sink. If you sink, he'll raise you
[2:28:30] up again. Somebody say, "Just ask
[2:28:32] Peter."
[2:28:34] He sunk.
[2:28:36] And what did the Lord do? Raise him
[2:28:37] right up again. That's right. You won't
[2:28:40] know until you try. That's right.
[2:28:44] You can't sink. If if you do sink, he'll
[2:28:46] raise you up again. So, what difference
[2:28:47] does it
[2:28:48] make? That's what that's what that's
[2:28:51] what Big Mama said. What difference does
[2:28:52] it make? I'm not going to panic and run
[2:28:54] around and the eternal life. God who can
[2:28:57] make all creation obey him. Oh, I love
[2:28:59] that old church song. The winds and the
[2:29:01] waves obey his will. Peace be still.
[2:29:03] Peace be still. And if you don't know
[2:29:04] that, that's Bea Jackson's song.
[2:29:08] Everything has to obey him. All nature
[2:29:11] has to obey him. He is the creator of
[2:29:13] nature. Amen. The disciples found their
[2:29:16] self at the end. It must have dawned on
[2:29:18] them. They seen they couldn't do nothing
[2:29:20] about it. It must have dawned on them.
[2:29:22] Say, "We're in an awful shape here. Oh,
[2:29:24] I'm going to die. I don't want to
[2:29:26] drown." One of them must have said,
[2:29:28] "Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Did it
[2:29:30] ever dawn on you that he's laying right
[2:29:32] there?
[2:29:34] We've been talking all about him,
[2:29:36] testifying about him, about the great
[2:29:38] works, and claiming him to be the
[2:29:40] Messiah. And there he is, right here
[2:29:42] with us. Oh. Oh, glory. Oh, what a
[2:29:45] feeling. Hello. Anybody reading that
[2:29:47] with me? We're in a tether, and there he
[2:29:50] lays.
[2:29:52] Now, that's not what the bride's going
[2:29:53] to
[2:29:55] say. You don't have to say, "Oh, Lord,
[2:29:57] here we are worried and he's with
[2:30:01] us." That's not what he said. The rock
[2:30:04] is only smitten once. The next time it
[2:30:06] was the speaking to the rock that
[2:30:08] brought the water. This little bride's
[2:30:11] going to operate in that full authority
[2:30:13] of the spoken word and you're not going
[2:30:15] to have to wake anybody up. You're going
[2:30:18] to wake up and you're going to recognize
[2:30:21] what you have, what he has given you. Oh
[2:30:25] Jesus have
[2:30:26] mercy. Jehovah Gyra, he was a man when
[2:30:29] he come down off the mountain that night
[2:30:30] hungry looking around for something to
[2:30:32] eat. was a man when he couldn't find
[2:30:33] nothing to eat on the fig tree. That was
[2:30:35] a man hungry. But when he take five
[2:30:37] biscuits and two little fishes and fed
[2:30:39] 5,000, that was more than a man. Sure
[2:30:41] was. He was a man that night out in the
[2:30:42] little boat out there on the wavy sea
[2:30:44] storm up. 10,000 devils of the sea swore
[2:30:47] they'd drown him. And that little old
[2:30:48] boat pitching like a bottle stopper out
[2:30:50] there. He was a man laying there so
[2:30:52] tired and weary till even the waves
[2:30:54] didn't wake him up. But when he got up,
[2:30:56] put his foot on the braille of the boat
[2:30:57] and looked up and said, "Peace be
[2:30:59] still." And the winds and the waves
[2:31:00] obeyed him. That was more than a man.
[2:31:03] That was God. All that was in the
[2:31:06] Father, he poured into the Son. All that
[2:31:08] was in the Son, he did what with it? He
[2:31:10] poured that into this little bride by
[2:31:12] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire.
[2:31:14] Let somebody say amen. Truly, he cried
[2:31:16] for mercy at the cross. He cried like a
[2:31:18] man. When he was dying, but when he rose
[2:31:21] on Easter morning, he said he proved he
[2:31:24] was God. He's a resurrected one. He's a
[2:31:26] God man. God was in Christ. What if you
[2:31:30] understood? What if you had a revelation
[2:31:32] of who you are and what you are and the
[2:31:35] dual nature that you've been given in
[2:31:36] the last days? One more calling Jesus on
[2:31:39] the scene Denim Springs. Do you believe
[2:31:41] that? That's the same thing. You believe
[2:31:42] Jesus Christ's presence is here now.
[2:31:44] Congregation said, "Amen." How many
[2:31:46] accepts that? Amen. Oh, what a security.
[2:31:48] What a security. What did you do? You
[2:31:51] awakened him. You brought him on the
[2:31:54] scene. Here he is on the scene. That
[2:31:57] don't make any difference what the
[2:31:58] boat's saying. Remember, he can say,
[2:32:01] "Peace be still." Doesn't matter what
[2:32:03] the doctor's saying. Doesn't matter what
[2:32:05] the weatherman is saying. Doesn't matter
[2:32:08] what the devil is saying. Peace be still
[2:32:11] is what he says. He can make the
[2:32:14] storm a calm.
[2:32:18] He can take your anxiety, your panic
[2:32:21] attack, your depression, your
[2:32:23] oppression, your mental battle, your
[2:32:26] emotions out of whack. Yes.
[2:32:29] Yes sir. I understand I understand the
[2:32:33] role that hormones plays in what goes on
[2:32:36] in both male bodies and female bodies.
[2:32:38] But I want you to know we have come to
[2:32:40] blame a lot of things on chemistry
[2:32:45] that should be directed toward the enemy
[2:32:49] because he wants to whip up a storm
[2:32:51] wherever he can. Even even if it's in
[2:32:53] the chemistry of your blood. He's a
[2:32:55] liar. He's the father of all lies.
[2:33:00] Amen. Five generations of my family have
[2:33:03] died with heart disease. You say, "Oh,
[2:33:06] really?" Are you Are you aiming to make
[2:33:08] it
[2:33:09] six? Or are you determined to recognize
[2:33:12] that you're living in the greatest hour?
[2:33:17] You're living in an hour greater greater
[2:33:19] than the generations before you. You're
[2:33:22] living in an hour where God said, "I'm
[2:33:24] going to manifest sons
[2:33:27] on the earth." Amen. I was the seed that
[2:33:30] went in the ground. Our Lord said,
[2:33:32] "You're the harvest."
[2:33:36] You'll never get that by visiting him
[2:33:38] casually from time to time. You'll only
[2:33:41] find that place when you hang with him,
[2:33:46] when you choose him
[2:33:49] over and over and over and over and over
[2:33:50] and over again. Uh, let's see. It's 129.
[2:33:53] Could I take another moment? I know you
[2:33:57] you're just being
[2:34:02] kind. Let me ask this little brother
[2:34:04] here. You came all the way from New
[2:34:06] Mexico. When are you going
[2:34:09] home? Oh, well, you've got we've got
[2:34:11] plenty of time to preach a little longer
[2:34:12] then, don't we? You don't have to be
[2:34:14] leave till Monday at
[2:34:15] 10:00. He came all the way from New
[2:34:19] Mexico to be baptized in the name of the
[2:34:21] Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[2:34:26] [Applause]
[2:34:32] Shouldn't I think about him? Shouldn't I
[2:34:34] consider him a little bit? Good. I I'm
[2:34:37] glad you see it my way.
[2:34:40] Isaiah chapter 4. Go there with me just
[2:34:42] a moment. And the Lord, verse 5, and the
[2:34:44] Lord will create upon every dwelling
[2:34:45] place on Mount Zion, and upon her
[2:34:48] assemblies, a cloud and a smoke by day,
[2:34:51] and the shining of a flaming fire by
[2:34:53] night, for upon all the glory. For upon
[2:34:56] all the
[2:34:59] glory shall be
[2:35:03] a
[2:35:09] defense. And there shall be a
[2:35:12] tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime
[2:35:15] from the heat and for a place of refuge
[2:35:19] and for a covert from storm and from
[2:35:23] rain. Do you know what God is saying
[2:35:25] through the prophet Isaiah to his
[2:35:27] people? I've got you covered.
[2:35:32] Doesn't matter what it is. I've got you
[2:35:35] covered. He's giving them a millennial
[2:35:38] promise. He's giving them a promise of a
[2:35:39] restored kingdom on the other side. But
[2:35:42] I want you to know that the reality of
[2:35:44] this truth is not just something that
[2:35:46] you experience on the other side. It's
[2:35:49] something that you can take. Remember
[2:35:51] the New Testament tells us that there is
[2:35:53] a maturity. There is a there is a group
[2:35:55] of of mature people raised up
[2:35:58] established in the last days who are
[2:36:00] given the privilege of
[2:36:03] tasting tasting the
[2:36:07] powers of the age to come.
[2:36:13] Anybody in here like to take a bite out
[2:36:16] of millennial glory on this side of the
[2:36:19] millennium? The New Testament says you
[2:36:21] can taste the
[2:36:24] powers, the glories
[2:36:28] of the age to come. You mean over here
[2:36:31] in what we know is Satan's Eden, in the
[2:36:34] last of the last days, in the closing of
[2:36:36] the Leodysian church age, and yet there
[2:36:40] will be somebody who will reach over
[2:36:43] into millennial glory and take a bite
[2:36:46] out of it.
[2:36:49] God said there would be.
[2:36:53] No, I didn't fall and I'm going to live.
[2:36:56] Jesus name. Amen.
[2:37:00] Jesus, the word, the scripture, the
[2:37:03] spirit of God witnesses to us that this
[2:37:06] is the truth.
[2:37:08] All of creation
[2:37:11] groanth for the manifestation to the
[2:37:13] sons of God. And we're still running
[2:37:16] around like little mice in an experiment
[2:37:20] now, brother. When we've been through
[2:37:23] the fire and he brought us through and
[2:37:26] we've been through the flood and he
[2:37:28] brought us through. He fed us when we
[2:37:30] were hungry. Come on. He gave us rest
[2:37:32] when we were weary. Didn't he do it?
[2:37:35] Haven't you been on this third Exodus
[2:37:37] journey for a while now?
[2:37:39] Haven't you been coming out of something
[2:37:41] your whole life and heading into
[2:37:44] something else? Is that not your story?
[2:37:47] It's my story. My whole life I've been
[2:37:50] coming out of something and going into
[2:37:52] something. What about an hour that we
[2:37:55] would be able to take a bite, a taste, a
[2:37:59] sample over here, sir, of what's waiting
[2:38:03] for us over there, tasting the powers of
[2:38:06] the age to come. Yes, sir. Why don't
[2:38:08] they talk about that? We're talking
[2:38:10] about it this morning. That's millennial
[2:38:13] authority. Lion laying down with the
[2:38:14] lamb. A little child playing on the hole
[2:38:17] of an asp. The the the deadliest kind of
[2:38:20] snake in that part of the world. A
[2:38:22] little child leading the beast of the
[2:38:24] wild. Come on, Johnny
[2:38:27] Cash. Sing it to
[2:38:29] us. Peace in the
[2:38:32] valley. Peace in the valley.
[2:38:37] lion laying down with the lamb. That's
[2:38:40] part of the powers of the age to come.
[2:38:42] What does that represent? It represents
[2:38:44] the authority over curses. Yes, sir. The
[2:38:48] whole enmity of the of that kingdom, the
[2:38:50] animal kingdom, all of the enmity there
[2:38:52] is a result of the fall.
[2:38:57] The love projected from the prophet who
[2:38:59] who spoke to the bull that was reversing
[2:39:02] the curse in that moment. when you have
[2:39:06] exercised that kind of love, that kind
[2:39:08] of
[2:39:09] peace with a with a hornet or whatever
[2:39:13] it is you're encountering. And some have
[2:39:15] really thought, I'm going to I'm going
[2:39:16] to see if that I'm going to take some
[2:39:18] I'm going I'm going to try
[2:39:19] that and it
[2:39:22] works. What that is is just a little
[2:39:24] foretaste what God let brother Brandon
[2:39:26] we talked about Sadu Sundar sing and
[2:39:28] there's so many others through the ages
[2:39:30] that we have the recorded testimonies of
[2:39:32] how God gave them that place of peace
[2:39:34] and authority even over that animal
[2:39:36] kingdom uh uh you know I don't know how
[2:39:39] many alligators you're going to run into
[2:39:40] in your life and uh whatever but the
[2:39:43] reality is that's only a small
[2:39:47] part we're talking about a changing a
[2:39:52] whole having a whole body. We're we're
[2:39:55] talking about what God did for the
[2:39:57] children of Israel as they journeyed 40
[2:39:59] years in the wilderness without a feeble
[2:40:02] one among them.
[2:40:06] No TJ Maxx to stop in for a bigger size
[2:40:08] of shoes. Hello.
[2:40:11] No Dollar General for a t-shirt when the
[2:40:13] one you had on you've outgrown it. The
[2:40:15] Bible said they didn't need it. I don't
[2:40:18] know what happened. Perhaps their
[2:40:19] clothes just grew with them as they
[2:40:22] went. Really, they were tasting. They
[2:40:24] were really tasting something. They were
[2:40:26] really running. Forerunners. They were
[2:40:28] showing us that God has a way of getting
[2:40:30] you over and taking care of you on the
[2:40:32] journey. And what did those people do
[2:40:35] instead of understanding the beauty of
[2:40:37] what God was doing for them? They belly
[2:40:39] achd and they grumbled and they
[2:40:41] complained and they lived lukewarm lives
[2:40:45] and blamed the prophets and blamed God
[2:40:47] and blamed everybody else. Blamed their
[2:40:49] wives and blamed their husbands. Come
[2:40:51] on.
[2:40:52] And God was right there taking care of
[2:40:54] them. The rock followed them. Paul said
[2:40:56] it followed them. The water went with
[2:40:58] them wherever they went. Just like the
[2:41:00] brother was preaching to us last night.
[2:41:01] The well is in you. Come on. You believe
[2:41:04] God did that for them? Do you believe
[2:41:07] he's the same today? Somebody say, "I
[2:41:10] can't even fathom this, Brother Shel. I
[2:41:11] I can't pay my power bill. I'm trying to
[2:41:13] believe God to pay my power bill." And
[2:41:16] here you are talking about the spoken
[2:41:18] word, speaking the thing. Try it. Try
[2:41:21] try it on that. Try it on that. Lord, I
[2:41:23] need provision in the name of Jesus. I
[2:41:26] have obeyed my covenant with you. I have
[2:41:28] given you what was yours and I have laid
[2:41:32] the top. I've laid the offering on the
[2:41:34] top of that and I have given it unto the
[2:41:36] Lord and I am thanking you right now for
[2:41:39] the abundance.
[2:41:41] And right now I don't need a running
[2:41:43] over bank account. I just need a bill
[2:41:45] paid.
[2:41:47] Can he do it?
[2:41:52] He does.
[2:41:55] He does. Not only can he, he does. No
[2:41:58] need to panic.
[2:42:01] No need to cower in fear. He said, "I'll
[2:42:04] be a defense. My glory shall be a
[2:42:07] defense." Anybody know what that word
[2:42:08] defense is there in the
[2:42:11] Hebrew? It's
[2:42:14] hoopa. It's the bridal canopy.
[2:42:18] God said, "I'll be the I'll be Listen,
[2:42:21] this is a symbol of marriage.
[2:42:24] When you when you take on the name of
[2:42:25] Jesus Christ in baptism, it's like a
[2:42:27] marriage. You're wearing his name.
[2:42:30] You're carrying the authority of his
[2:42:32] name. Amen.
[2:42:34] So, so God said, "Look, I'm just going
[2:42:37] to let my glory come down over you like
[2:42:39] a like a hoopa, like a like a canopy,
[2:42:42] like a bridal tent, and I'm going to
[2:42:44] take care of you."
[2:42:48] I believe him.
[2:42:50] I believe him.
[2:42:52] He said, "Then I'll be a tabernacle." Do
[2:42:54] you know what that word tabernacle is in
[2:42:56] the in the Hebrew? It's suka.
[2:43:00] It's the name for the booth that they
[2:43:02] lived in at tabernacles at Sukkot. God
[2:43:06] said, "I will be a bridal canopy over
[2:43:08] your head. My glory will be a bridal
[2:43:10] canopy over your head. And I will be a
[2:43:14] tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime
[2:43:17] from the heat, for a place of refuge,
[2:43:19] and for a covert from the storm and from
[2:43:22] the rain." Brother, sister, you cannot
[2:43:25] lose.
[2:43:27] You cannot lose when you know whose you
[2:43:30] are.
[2:43:32] There's something so
[2:43:34] beautiful in that tabernacle. There's
[2:43:37] something so beautiful in that bridal
[2:43:40] canopy. That bridal canopy speaks to us
[2:43:42] of
[2:43:44] intimacy. That's becoming one with the
[2:43:46] bridegroom. The promise for the last day
[2:43:49] bride, the last church age bride, that
[2:43:50] bride coming out of Leodysia, her
[2:43:53] promise is that she will walk in union.
[2:43:57] with Messiah.
[2:43:58] Paul was a forerunner. He began to talk
[2:44:00] about that that
[2:44:02] union being one with him. There's no
[2:44:06] panic in him. There's no fear in him.
[2:44:08] There's no death in him. There's no
[2:44:09] worry in him. There's no anxiety in him.
[2:44:12] There's no cancer in him.
[2:44:18] Becoming one with him. And that only
[2:44:20] takes place when we are spending quality
[2:44:24] time with
[2:44:27] him. And that's not two times a week in
[2:44:30] church. That's a daily daily daily daily
[2:44:34] daily relationship.
[2:44:37] I sat on this platform last night. And I
[2:44:39] scanned this auditorium as our brother
[2:44:41] was preaching and I wondered in my heart
[2:44:43] how many of us really
[2:44:45] understand what it is to be so thirsty
[2:44:48] that nothing satisfies. What quenched
[2:44:52] your thirst yesterday does not quench
[2:44:54] your thirst today. You are so desirous
[2:44:57] of him. I've got to have more of him. I
[2:45:00] wonder how many of us woke up this
[2:45:01] morning realizing I've got to have more
[2:45:04] of him.
[2:45:06] You know this for many many years I wake
[2:45:09] up every morning with a
[2:45:11] song. Most of the time it's a precious,
[2:45:14] beautiful gospel song. On rare occasion
[2:45:19] it has been a secular song that God was
[2:45:22] going to use to talk to me through. And
[2:45:23] he can use anything he wants to.
[2:45:27] So don't be religious.
[2:45:29] Now, I woke up this morning singing this
[2:45:32] old hymn, this old song.
[2:45:35] Longing, longing for Jesus.
[2:45:40] [Music]
[2:45:41] I have a longing in my heart for
[2:45:49] him, just to be near
[2:45:54] him and to feel his
[2:45:59] presence. I have a longing in my heart
[2:46:06] for him.
[2:46:11] Longing longing for
[2:46:16] Jesus. I have a longing in my heart for
[2:46:24] him just to be near
[2:46:29] him to feel his presence.
[2:46:36] I have a longing in my heart for him. I
[2:46:43] don't hear you
[2:46:46] longing, longing for
[2:46:50] [Music]
[2:46:52] I have a longing in my
[2:46:56] heart for him
[2:47:01] just to be near.
[2:47:06] and to feel his
[2:47:11] presence. I have a longing in my heart.
[2:47:21] Longing longing for Jesus.
[2:47:25] [Music]
[2:47:27] I have a longing in my heart
[2:47:32] for him.
[2:47:35] Just to be near
[2:47:39] him, to feel his
[2:47:44] presence. I have a long
[2:47:50] [Music]
[2:47:54] longing for Jesus.
[2:47:59] I have a longing in my heart for
[2:48:06] him, just to be near
[2:48:11] him, to feel his presence.
[2:48:18] I have a longing in my heart for
[2:48:26] longing longing for Jesus.
[2:48:31] [Music]
[2:48:33] I have all
[2:48:35] in my heart for
[2:48:41] just to be
[2:48:45] to feel his presence.
[2:48:51] I have a longing in my heart
[2:48:56] for
[2:48:59] longing, longing for Jesus.
[2:49:05] I have a longing in my heart for
[2:49:12] him, just to be near
[2:49:16] him, to feel his
[2:49:20] [Music]
[2:49:21] presence. I have a longing in my heart.
[2:49:27] [Music]
[2:49:31] Can you imagine
[2:49:33] singing a song like
[2:49:36] that? I have a longing in my heart for
[2:49:39] Jesus while checking the basketball
[2:49:42] score.
[2:49:50] C can you imagine sitting in a service
[2:49:54] where the anointed and revealed word of
[2:49:56] God is going forth and you're more
[2:50:00] concerned about the weather
[2:50:02] report now. Can you imagine that? I
[2:50:05] can't imagine that. Can you I can't
[2:50:07] imagine that. I can't imagine someone
[2:50:10] sitting in an atmosphere like we often
[2:50:12] find ourselves in here uh watching for
[2:50:15] the for the latest Fox News notification
[2:50:20] now and then chasing the video rabbit
[2:50:23] trail that
[2:50:24] brother we don't make any sense sometime
[2:50:29] I'm not condemning you I'm telling you
[2:50:30] we we don't make any sense sometime we
[2:50:33] sit in a service last night hungry
[2:50:35] thirsty the message thirsting for Jesus
[2:50:37] hungry for Jesus And we all nod our
[2:50:40] heads and we all say amen. And we all
[2:50:41] wiggle our toes and we walk out of here
[2:50:43] thinking we're the hungriest people for
[2:50:45] Jesus that there has ever been. We don't
[2:50:47] even make it to the car
[2:50:50] before we have checked in with this old
[2:50:52] world.
[2:50:55] So afraid that something's happening out
[2:50:57] there and we've got this FOMO disease,
[2:51:00] fear of missing out. So afraid that
[2:51:02] something's going to happen and we're
[2:51:03] somebody's going to tweet and we're not
[2:51:04] going to know what they said. and
[2:51:06] somebody's going to do this and we're
[2:51:07] not going to know. Come on, folks. I'm
[2:51:09] not here to make you mad. We got to go.
[2:51:11] We I don't want to make wear you out,
[2:51:13] but I just got to tell you something. I
[2:51:15] I I found I'm finding it very very
[2:51:19] difficult
[2:51:22] to watch
[2:51:24] people raise one hand and and and trim
[2:51:28] their
[2:51:30] fingernails with the other
[2:51:32] hand. Do you understand? That's that's
[2:51:35] going through the
[2:51:36] motion without feeling the connection.
[2:51:41] That's why we're so anxious and that's
[2:51:44] why we're so fearful.
[2:51:48] Be because we're we're just half in this
[2:51:50] thing. Somebody said, "He's not talking
[2:51:52] to me." Good, but let me talk to the
[2:51:54] ones I am talking to.
[2:51:57] We're not in this thing. And we wonder
[2:51:59] why we're not talking to storms and why
[2:52:01] we're not speaking to growths and why
[2:52:03] tumors aren't disappearing and we can't
[2:52:05] even get along with each other.
[2:52:08] That's right. Yes, sir. Oh, no. Here she
[2:52:10] comes.
[2:52:12] This is the attitude we carry sometime.
[2:52:15] We we're we're talking about becoming
[2:52:17] one with him. Uh you know, brother
[2:52:18] Brandham, in that message, he he's
[2:52:20] talking when he's giving us the tent
[2:52:22] vision. I'm not ashamed to call his
[2:52:24] name. If you don't like it, lump it.
[2:52:30] He wasn't a perfect man, but he was a
[2:52:32] man that God chose to use in my life.
[2:52:36] He's telling the vision of the
[2:52:39] tent. And the carnal-minded people who
[2:52:42] followed him then and the carnal-minded
[2:52:45] people who follow him now would rather
[2:52:47] believe that they're going to put up a
[2:52:50] literal tent and he's going to come back
[2:52:52] and need an airplane to get from meeting
[2:52:54] to meeting. Come on now. This is what
[2:52:57] some of those folks have committed their
[2:52:59] life to. And I wonder what Jesus would
[2:53:03] say to us today. He'd say, "I'd like to
[2:53:04] tell you something spiritual, but you're
[2:53:06] so carnal that you wouldn't even get
[2:53:07] what I'm saying." Wouldn't he say that
[2:53:10] to some of them here? They talk about
[2:53:12] who we are and the authority of the
[2:53:13] bride and the spoken word, and they're
[2:53:16] waiting on a one-man resurrection.
[2:53:21] But when he told us that tent vision, he
[2:53:25] let us know
[2:53:27] that every part of it had a spiritual
[2:53:29] meaning.
[2:53:31] Not a literal fulfillment, but a
[2:53:33] spiritual fulfillment. And he gets right
[2:53:35] down to the end of it and he said, he
[2:53:39] said, "What's that word you were hunting
[2:53:41] for the other
[2:53:45] day?" What's that word you were hunting
[2:53:47] for the other day?
[2:53:50] He never told us what the word
[2:53:52] was. But what is he preaching about?
[2:53:55] He's preaching about tent, a
[2:53:58] tent. He's preaching about a little tent
[2:54:00] or a little room within this greater
[2:54:03] canopy where people are going in and
[2:54:07] they're coming out under the ministry of
[2:54:08] the spoken word and they go in one way
[2:54:11] and they come out another. And we would
[2:54:14] like to think that's because they met
[2:54:15] the preacher or the prophet or the or
[2:54:17] whoever in there. But the reality is
[2:54:19] that's not what you meet in the bridal
[2:54:20] canopy.
[2:54:22] If you do, that's sickening. You don't
[2:54:25] It's perverted. You don't go into bridal
[2:54:26] canopy to lay with your pastor.
[2:54:29] You don't go into bridal canopy to lay
[2:54:31] with a prophet. You go into bridal
[2:54:33] canopy to lay with your mate. Is that
[2:54:36] right? Oh, I don't have time. This is
[2:54:38] what God woke me up with this morning.
[2:54:40] Don't have time to go into it now. But
[2:54:41] that's the place of intimacy.
[2:54:44] That's the place that in ancient times
[2:54:46] the family and the community would
[2:54:47] gather around the hoopa. They would
[2:54:50] gather around the tent. Walls uh would
[2:54:53] be dropped down. The the heavy c uh
[2:54:56] heavy cloth walls of the of this canopy
[2:54:59] where the vows had been taken would
[2:55:00] become it would now become a chamber of
[2:55:03] intimacy. Is that right? And yet
[2:55:06] everybody would gather around on the
[2:55:07] outside. Can you imagine? No privacy.
[2:55:11] But that's the way it was done. And they
[2:55:13] were waiting on something. I'm going to
[2:55:15] get plain. I'll hurry. I'll hurry at it.
[2:55:17] They were waiting on the tokens of
[2:55:19] virginity to be passed out.
[2:55:23] What in the world are you talking about?
[2:55:24] The Bible talks about the bloody sheet.
[2:55:28] Yes, sir. It It had to be passed out to
[2:55:31] the father of the bride because he was
[2:55:34] going to fold that thing up and put it
[2:55:35] away so that if that ever man got
[2:55:37] religious like some of these folks have
[2:55:39] done. Come on now, brother. And would
[2:55:41] come back and say, "I don't want that
[2:55:42] wife anymore. She wasn't pure. She
[2:55:44] wasn't pure when I married her, and I
[2:55:46] don't want her anymore. Her daddy." Come
[2:55:48] on now. That's right. Let me tell you
[2:55:50] something, you buzzard.
[2:55:53] I have the proof. I have the tokens of
[2:55:56] her virginity right here. It was kept in
[2:55:59] in a in a pouch in a in in some kind of
[2:56:01] fancy thing and put away like a woman
[2:56:04] would put a treasure away in a china
[2:56:05] closet somewhere. That's how it was all
[2:56:07] through scripture. So that the enemy
[2:56:10] could never come back and say you
[2:56:11] wouldn't you wasn't pure. You you know
[2:56:13] it didn't happen what you come on.
[2:56:15] That's right.
[2:56:17] And what what what did that represent?
[2:56:19] It represented that someone had a
[2:56:22] longing for for the bridegroom.
[2:56:25] And they didn't just go in there and
[2:56:26] shake hands.
[2:56:29] Right.
[2:56:31] They they went in there and consummated
[2:56:33] the relationship. Yes, sir.
[2:56:36] Now, that is the comparison that we're
[2:56:38] given in this hour to what takes place
[2:56:42] in that room within a room or that
[2:56:44] little tent within a bigger uh canopy of
[2:56:46] a tent. You you go in one way, you come
[2:56:48] out the other side just like him.
[2:56:51] Not because you read a book or heard a
[2:56:53] tape. You come out the other side just
[2:56:56] like him because you've consummated your
[2:56:59] relationship with him.
[2:57:01] I'm not trying to be sexual. I'm not
[2:57:04] trying to be vulgar, but I am telling
[2:57:06] you that a casual rendevous with the
[2:57:09] master is not going to give us authority
[2:57:12] over our circumstances.
[2:57:14] You're going to have to know you've been
[2:57:16] with him.
[2:57:18] Yes, sir. In the same manner that the
[2:57:20] little maid said to Peter, "I know
[2:57:23] you're one of them. I know you've been
[2:57:24] with them. Your speech betrays you." And
[2:57:28] he raised up just had told the Lord a
[2:57:29] few hours before, "I'll never I'll never
[2:57:31] betray you. I'll ne I'll never deny you.
[2:57:34] Oh, Jesus basically said, "I wished it
[2:57:37] were true." But the reality is three
[2:57:39] times before the crows. But he
[2:57:42] wasn't condemning him. He had no
[2:57:45] condemnation for him. He loved him so
[2:57:47] much he'd already prayed that his faith
[2:57:49] wouldn't fail.
[2:57:51] There was no
[2:57:52] condemnation. Peter couldn't believe it
[2:57:54] about himself.
[2:57:56] But the reality was the little woman
[2:57:59] said, "I know you're one of them. I
[2:58:01] don't know what you're talking
[2:58:03] about. There was nobody to say, "Wait a
[2:58:05] minute. Here's the proof.
[2:58:09] He's been with
[2:58:10] him. He's become one with the word."
[2:58:14] He's laid down his own thoughts and
[2:58:15] feelings and I've got this impression
[2:58:17] and I don't see it that ways. You know,
[2:58:19] I don't see it that way and I got a
[2:58:20] little different thought about that
[2:58:21] scripture and I got a little different
[2:58:23] idea over here. He's laid all that down
[2:58:25] and he's gone into that little place of
[2:58:27] intimacy and the veil has fallen behind
[2:58:29] him. Shutting him in with master and
[2:58:32] shutting out the world and
[2:58:33] denominational pools and pressures and
[2:58:35] lies. Come on now. That's what I'm
[2:58:37] after. That's what I have to have in my
[2:58:39] own life. Longing. I've got a longing.
[2:58:41] I've got a longing in my heart. I've got
[2:58:43] a longing in my heart for him. And I'm
[2:58:45] finding it more and more and more
[2:58:48] difficult to deal with the mundane.
[2:58:54] to let trauma, to let anxiety, to let
[2:58:57] fear, to let depression rule my day and
[2:59:01] keep me out of that place, even if it's
[2:59:04] for but a moment. Jason, you got to
[2:59:07] work. Got to pay bills.
[2:59:09] But if you can catch a
[2:59:12] moment, just a
[2:59:17] moment with
[2:59:20] him without your stupid phone.
[2:59:26] If you can just catch a moment with him.
[2:59:36] I hate religion. And I I I hate
[2:59:42] church. I
[2:59:44] do. I'm going to offend
[2:59:46] you. I hate it. I hate what it becomes.
[2:59:53] I hate what we've made it.
[2:59:59] It's not about performance. It's not
[3:00:03] about being something and looking a
[3:00:05] certain way. It's not about that.
[3:00:08] It's about another
[3:00:10] opportunity to be with him.
[3:00:14] So what if your birthday doesn't get
[3:00:15] mentioned?
[3:00:17] What if we forget to take the offering?
[3:00:19] What if the preacher preaches all day?
[3:00:23] It's about him.
[3:00:25] It's about him. We are so
[3:00:28] distracted. Somebody said, "But brother
[3:00:30] Shel, you don't have little babies." I I
[3:00:32] feel I tell you my heart
[3:00:34] breaks when I think about these little
[3:00:36] mothers and how they have to wrestle
[3:00:38] babies and but it's just
[3:00:41] reality. But can I remind you it won't
[3:00:43] always be that
[3:00:47] way. It won't always be that way.
[3:00:52] God bless you and fill you and steal
[3:00:55] every moment you can to encounter his
[3:00:58] presence because I know you miss so much
[3:01:00] of the service. Now, if you go out and
[3:01:03] you sit back there in that nursery and
[3:01:05] talk and
[3:01:08] chitchat when you ought to be in here, I
[3:01:11] don't feel sorry for you at
[3:01:15] all. if you're just back there chewing
[3:01:17] the stuff and you can do that after
[3:01:21] church. But if you're in there really
[3:01:23] struggling with a baby trying to get it
[3:01:24] to sleep or feed your little baby and
[3:01:26] you're missing out on what I feel sorry
[3:01:27] for you. Amen. But we get so
[3:01:34] comfortable. We're going to have to have
[3:01:36] a change here pretty soon. And I can't
[3:01:38] make you and you can't make me. But I
[3:01:41] woke up this morning again with a
[3:01:42] longing for him. What if I pray? What if
[3:01:45] I pray and believe that you'll wake
[3:01:48] up with a longing for him like you've
[3:01:51] never had
[3:01:55] before? You know what they used to do?
[3:01:58] They used to sit in their living room
[3:02:00] after a long hard day work and just sing
[3:02:03] his praise. That's what families used to
[3:02:06] do. and read the Bible and pray a little
[3:02:11] and sing a little more and let the
[3:02:14] presence of the Lord saturate the
[3:02:17] family. We need a little more of that.
[3:02:20] We might have to schedule it now, but we
[3:02:22] need a little more of that. We need a
[3:02:24] little less of the world, like brother
[3:02:26] was preaching last night. And we need a
[3:02:28] lot more him. Musicians come. I I have
[3:02:31] uh ruined the end of
[3:02:33] this, but I I'm moved. I I'm moved. I'm
[3:02:37] I'm moved because I know what's going to
[3:02:40] make the
[3:02:45] difference. You can't make yourself
[3:02:48] desire it. You can't make yourself
[3:02:51] desperate. It don't happen that way. You
[3:02:53] can't grunt and want more of him. The
[3:02:57] only advice I have is is make up your
[3:03:00] mind to have less of the world
[3:03:03] and watch and see what happens.
[3:03:06] I truly believe if you choose less of
[3:03:09] the world, you open your life for a
[3:03:12] greater hunger for him. I do. That's
[3:03:15] right. I don't believe we long for him
[3:03:17] like we used to because we fill it up
[3:03:19] with so many other things.
[3:03:24] Romance novels
[3:03:27] and all this stuff.
[3:03:31] Trash. Grown men addicted to comic
[3:03:34] books. Come on, folks. Really, I I'm
[3:03:37] honest. I'm not trying to be ugly. All
[3:03:40] All you uh video game
[3:03:45] addicts, what's wrong with
[3:03:48] you? No, you're not longing for him
[3:03:52] because you fill every moment with
[3:03:55] something else.
[3:03:58] We are so wired that we can't even sit
[3:04:01] in a room and be quiet and be
[3:04:05] still. The enemy has really pulled a
[3:04:10] trick.
[3:04:12] He has allowed us to be conditioned by
[3:04:16] the world around
[3:04:18] us so that we just can't even be still.
[3:04:20] We just can't even be quiet. We can't
[3:04:22] even just sing to him.
[3:04:29] the message people the
[3:04:31] same you
[3:04:33] know if I say this it'll be
[3:04:35] misunderstood but but all I hear them
[3:04:37] said oh here tape here tape here tape
[3:04:38] here tape here tape here tape here tape
[3:04:40] here tape here tape tape I believe that
[3:04:43] I believe we ought to hear them but I
[3:04:45] want you to know that you're just if
[3:04:47] you're just listening that tape and
[3:04:48] you're not relating that truth to your
[3:04:50] life and applying it and hearing it in
[3:04:52] faith and doing something about it it's
[3:04:54] just like this That's right.
[3:04:58] You got one hand in to the Lord and
[3:05:01] you're focused on your fingernails.
[3:05:04] I don't know what I'm going to do if
[3:05:05] somebody pulls their shoe off and starts
[3:05:07] working on their
[3:05:09] toenails. I use that as an
[3:05:11] example. I see people looking at one
[3:05:14] another's
[3:05:15] clothes while we're
[3:05:21] worshiping, longing.
[3:05:24] longing for
[3:05:27] Jesus. That's what it's going to take,
[3:05:29] right?
[3:05:31] And it's so
[3:05:33] close. You preach like it's a million
[3:05:35] miles away. Yeah, maybe. But the reality
[3:05:38] is it's one heartbeat, one breath from
[3:05:43] us. All it takes is a handful, a remnant
[3:05:47] to make up their mind. I've got to have
[3:05:48] him. I've got to have him. I'm desperate
[3:05:50] for him. I'm more desperate for him than
[3:05:52] a cheeseburger. I've got to have him. I
[3:05:55] have got to have him. I've got to deal
[3:05:58] with my storm. I've got to deal with my
[3:05:59] anxiety. I've got to do something about
[3:06:02] my fear. They're running rapid. I can't
[3:06:05] seem to control my emotions. I've got to
[3:06:08] do something about it. A few people get
[3:06:10] desperate like that. Run to
[3:06:12] him, spread their praise before him,
[3:06:15] with him, their full focus and
[3:06:17] attention, and they encounter the living
[3:06:20] God. And when you encounter the living
[3:06:22] God, you're never the same.
[3:06:24] You're never the same. Not
[3:06:28] religion. Relationship. Do you see the
[3:06:34] difference,
[3:06:38] Benjamin? I'm going to get you back. for
[3:06:40] all the years that people have, not you,
[3:06:43] but that people have turned services
[3:06:45] over to me in dull moments like this,
[3:06:48] and I've had to get up and
[3:06:50] preach. I'm going to see if you can come
[3:06:52] up with something that'll make us want
[3:06:53] to worship. I actually want to with all
[3:06:56] my heart, and I believe you do, too.
[3:06:59] Without a real closure, I don't know how
[3:07:02] to close
[3:07:03] this. Let's take a moment and worship
[3:07:05] him before we go. If you've got a
[3:07:07] longing in your heart, do something
[3:07:10] about
[3:07:11] it. If if you're hungering for more of
[3:07:13] him, do something about it this morning.
[3:07:15] Don't be satisfied with some surface
[3:07:18] relation. Oh,
[3:07:20] look for that place of oneness and
[3:07:22] intimacy with him. Jesus, I want you
[3:07:26] in with
[3:07:29] God in a
[3:07:33] secret place. I'll be the glory over
[3:07:36] your head there in the spirit. That's
[3:07:40] what you said, Lord.
[3:07:42] Behold,
[3:07:43] I'll be your defense.
[3:07:48] My glory will power
[3:07:51] you to run, defend you in the race,
[3:07:56] tabernacle over you. Oh, I
[3:07:59] long to be shut in with God.
[3:08:05] This me and you, Jesus.
[3:08:07] Oh, shut
[3:08:09] in with
[3:08:12] God in a
[3:08:15] secret place.
[3:08:19] There in the spirit beholding
[3:08:25] beholding his face
[3:08:28] gaining
[3:08:30] gaining new
[3:08:33] power to run in the race. Oh, I
[3:08:41] long to be shut in with God.
[3:08:49] Oh, shut
[3:08:51] in with
[3:08:54] God in a
[3:08:57] secret place. Somebody tell him, "I've
[3:09:00] got to have you there in the
[3:09:05] spirit
[3:09:07] beholding his face.
[3:09:11] I'm
[3:09:12] gaining new
[3:09:15] power to run in the race. Oh,
[3:09:21] I
[3:09:22] long to be shut in with God.
[3:09:31] Oh,
[3:09:32] shut
[3:09:33] in with God. Here I am, Lord, in a
[3:09:39] secret
[3:09:42] place. There in the spirit. Show me the
[3:09:47] way.
[3:09:49] Beholding his face. More of you, Lord.
[3:09:53] I'm
[3:09:54] gaining new
[3:09:57] power to run in the race.
[3:10:03] Oh, I
[3:10:05] long to be shut in with God. If there's
[3:10:10] anybody here this morning that would
[3:10:13] like to determine in your heart you
[3:10:15] don't want to leave here like you came,
[3:10:17] now is your opportunity to open up your
[3:10:21] heart in a bigger way to him than you
[3:10:23] ever have before. I wish we all could do
[3:10:25] that. I wish every one of us could open
[3:10:28] up our lives to him in a way maybe that
[3:10:31] we've never done before. or just wide
[3:10:32] open and say, "Lord, I am so ready for
[3:10:36] for a divine encounter with you. I'm so
[3:10:39] ready to be changed by your presence, by
[3:10:43] your glory, by your word. I'm so ready
[3:10:46] to commit all that I am to you. I've
[3:10:49] been holding back and I'm ready to give
[3:10:51] you my all." Then this is the chance to
[3:10:54] do that. I believe somebody here will
[3:10:58] make a difference. I do. I believe
[3:11:00] somebody here will find that place
[3:11:03] before you leave. I felt it when I woke
[3:11:05] up this morning that somebody was going
[3:11:09] to see a storm become a calm and it was
[3:11:12] going to be because they surrendered
[3:11:14] everything. They surrendered everything
[3:11:16] to him. Not my
[3:11:19] will. Can you say that and mean it from
[3:11:23] the bottom of who you are? Not my will,
[3:11:26] but your will be done.
[3:11:29] Not my expectation, Lord, but your
[3:11:33] divine destiny plan for my life. Let's
[3:11:37] open up our lives as we perhaps sing
[3:11:39] again. But if you don't sing, just take
[3:11:42] that moment to say, "Lord, here I am."
[3:11:44] Somebody do that right now.
[3:11:47] I hope you can recover.
[3:11:50] I hope you can take this moment to say,
[3:11:52] "Here I am."
[3:11:53] [Music]
[3:11:54] Spirit
[3:11:56] beholding his
[3:11:58] master master
[3:12:02] gaining new power. We perish to run in
[3:12:08] the race. Wake up Lord in us. I
[3:12:12] long to be shut in with God.
[3:12:19] Woo Jesus. Shut
[3:12:23] in with with
[3:12:25] God in a
[3:12:29] secret place.
[3:12:33] There in the
[3:12:36] spirit
[3:12:39] beholding his face gaining
[3:12:44] gaining new
[3:12:47] power to run in the race. Oh, I
[3:12:54] long to be shut in.
[3:13:00] Let's try something else.
[3:13:02] Let's try playing something with no
[3:13:05] words and let you and I try to uh to
[3:13:09] find a place to really talk to the Lord
[3:13:11] for a few moments. Let's do that. If you
[3:13:14] have to go, God bless you. Thank you for
[3:13:16] being with us. For those of you stay,
[3:13:19] we're going to have a great fellowship
[3:13:20] lunch together after a
[3:13:23] while. Why don't we just find a
[3:13:26] place? Let's talk to God like we know
[3:13:29] how to do. Father, here we are.
[3:13:32] Jesus.
