TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we see the enemy touching our family uh it's easy to just focus on that maybe we maybe we go a little bit beyond that and we're looking at the church and we're praying for our brothers and sisters in the church but God wants us concerned about our region he wants us concerned about our neighborhood he wants us concerned about our state he wants us praying and showing love uh concerning our nation the United States of America and he wants us to be praying for the nations of the world we're faithful to pray for Israel but how many of you know there's quite a few other nations out there and as sister Ruth would often sing I ask for the Nations and I call them by name and I present them to the father in jesus' name and so when God lets a nation roll through your mind there may be a more more of a reason for it than just keeping up with the news it may be that God is trying to give you an opportunity to pray it's a it's an opportunity in fact it's a privilege to be called to carry a prayer assignment for a nation and you wonder what difference one person can make in a great big old Nation but how many of you have read the book you've read the Bible and you know that just a few praying faithful intercessors can shift governments come on and we've seen what intercession can do we've watched intercession interrupt uh secret messages between uh Nations I I don't want to go too far into that but we've seen God do that we've seen God break off communication we've seen God temporarily shut down communication coming out of North Korea and and we've watched it and and some of the things that prayer has done we we'll never get a trophy for it here we we you'll never get an Accolade here prayer and intercession is one of the most thankless Ministries that you can have in this hour but I want you to know your reward when you get out of here what what Earth has discounted Heaven values and many of you are going to have rewards in eternity uh that you didn't know were coming and it's going to be because you took a burden for another Nation for another family for another region for another church do you know it's all right for you to be concerned about another church and pray for other churches and not just ours please don't uh forget about us while you're taking another assignment but I don't only want God to finish his work here I want him to finish his work in every church that he raised up if man raised it up it's up to God to take care but if God raised it up I want to see every God ordained purpose fulfilled in that church or in that Ministry
