[1:16:24] strength my friend
[1:16:27] he helps us through
[1:16:29] every
[1:16:30] low place and every high place
[1:16:33] he gives us the strength to go up and
[1:16:35] over
[1:16:36] he gives us strength to go through he
[1:16:38] gives us strength to go around whatever
[1:16:41] his roadmap is i want to stay right on
[1:16:44] the roadmap
[1:16:45] because whatever
[1:16:47] obstacle is in on that road map he is
[1:16:50] going to give me the grace to go through
[1:16:53] it he didn't bring it to stay he brought
[1:16:56] it to pass
[1:16:57] and and and i don't want if i'm in the
[1:17:00] heat of a battle i don't want to just
[1:17:02] get through it so i can face the next
[1:17:04] day i want to learn what the holy spirit
[1:17:08] wants me to learn i want to get all of
[1:17:11] the all of the material that i'm
[1:17:13] supposed to get for that season
[1:17:16] i don't want to hope that i get it in
[1:17:18] the next season i want all of his
[1:17:21] training that he's taken me through in
[1:17:24] this season to have its preeminence and
[1:17:26] to get inside of me so that i can face
[1:17:30] the next season and i realize that this
[1:17:33] life is a series of tests it's a series
[1:17:37] of battles it's a series of overcoming
[1:17:40] but then i realized that that is the
[1:17:42] very reason i was placed on the earth to
[1:17:46] overcome whatever was put in my path
[1:17:50] if i had not had that blessing put on my
[1:17:54] life i would be like the rest of the
[1:17:57] church world at large i would do
[1:17:59] whatever pleased self but by the grace
[1:18:02] of god by the goodness of god he's the
[1:18:05] one that put on me overcomer so
[1:18:08] therefore when the test comes he gives
[1:18:11] me grace to go through it go around it
[1:18:14] go over it whatever the road map says i
[1:18:17] want to be right in the middle of what

[1:29:56] did only did one
[1:29:58] they had bought a cassette and had given
[1:30:00] it to brother billy paul as a gift which

[1:30:04] when i would have ever had an
[1:30:05] opportunity to do that
[1:30:08] and uh
[1:30:09] a letter came in the mail and he said

[1:38:49] and i hadn't sung a much there was a few
[1:38:51] places there that were a little bit new
[1:38:53] to me but we got through it anyway
[1:38:56] i'm thankful
[1:38:58] whoa i'm a little out of breath though
[1:39:00] [Music]
[1:39:01] in the lord good
[1:39:03] let's thank god for the musicians
[1:39:06] praise the lord
[1:39:08] for every sacrifice
[1:39:13] praise god
[1:39:15] i don't know but i need your prayers
[1:39:19] like everybody else
[1:39:21] to get through this i need the lord's
[1:39:23] help
[1:39:26] i had an hour and 45 minutes sleep last
[1:39:28] night
[1:39:30] but god was good and all of that
[1:39:32] and he's stretching it
[1:39:34] how many of you know he'll stretch it
[1:39:37] and he'll give you
[1:39:38] strength hallelujah i said lord i can't
[1:39:41] sing that this morning i don't have the
[1:39:43] strength but he's got the strength
[1:39:46] you just have to let him i'm not ashamed
[1:39:49] of pentecost
[1:39:51] because for me it was not a denomination
[1:39:55] i only held license with the
[1:39:56] denomination just a very short period of
[1:39:59] time about 18 months
[1:40:01] and when they began to tell me what i
[1:40:03] could preach and what i couldn't preach
[1:40:04] and what i ought to preach
[1:40:06] put their hand on it and say that's
[1:40:08] offensive and that won't work and that's
[1:40:10] not just right
[1:40:12] then i had the grace of god i pass it
[1:40:14] all the time
[1:40:15] in phoenix city when i go to the uh
[1:40:17] synovus
[1:40:19] i uh a benjamin takes it for me a lot
[1:40:22] but he was
[1:40:23] busy this week
[1:40:25] and i took the payment and i passed down
[1:40:28] by the old post office and see the old
[1:40:30] assembly of god first assembly of god
[1:40:32] church
[1:40:33] sitting there you know it's on the
[1:40:35] highway now but it used to be
[1:40:37] in downtown phoenix city
[1:40:39] i pastored just around the corner
[1:40:42] at uh 12th street in 12th court it's
[1:40:45] where our church sat
[1:40:47] and the pastor calvary temple for almost
[1:40:49] three years
[1:40:50] and it was during that time
[1:40:53] that the denomination started putting a
[1:40:54] little pressure on us
[1:40:56] and the deacon board was even putting
[1:40:58] some pressure on us
[1:40:59] and they said well you know the bible
[1:41:01] didn't say how long is long and the
[1:41:04] bible didn't say how short is short
[1:41:07] and if you're going to be a part of a
[1:41:08] denomination i heard an our church our
[1:41:11] denomination then you ought to use
[1:41:13] evangelists
[1:41:15] that are licensed with our
[1:41:17] organization
[1:41:19] when they begin to say that i said well
[1:41:21] there really is no liberty then
[1:41:23] i draw a small check
[1:41:25] and i carry the title and i work like a
[1:41:28] dog but i don't have freedom to preach
[1:41:30] what the holy ghost gives me
[1:41:32] i said that don't sound like much of a
[1:41:35] oh i forgot i did get to drive free
[1:41:38] a
[1:41:39] beat-up
[1:41:40] volkswagen van
[1:41:43] it was
[1:41:44] browned i thank god for it
[1:41:47] but it was ugly
[1:41:49] and when i wanted to go up a hill i had
[1:41:51] to stand up
[1:41:55] i had to stand up because you couldn't
[1:41:56] get the pedal to the ground any other
[1:41:58] way the only way to get the pedal down
[1:41:59] all the way was to stand up so i climbed
[1:42:02] many hills
[1:42:03] standing up
[1:42:05] to get up the hill
[1:42:06] and then
[1:42:07] i know you're standing i'm gonna be i'm
[1:42:09] standing too and we'll be along on you
[1:42:12] uh
[1:42:13] then the former pastor of the church
[1:42:17] sued the church
[1:42:19] and so i was caught in the middle
[1:42:22] of something i had nothing to do with
[1:42:26] they trashed the parsonage
[1:42:28] and sued the church
[1:42:30] and it come time to ask that the
[1:42:34] headquarters would come down and protect
[1:42:36] us and stand for the defense of the
[1:42:38] church
[1:42:39] and uh i said to the deacon lord well
[1:42:42] you all did this you voted him in you
[1:42:44] voted him out i had nothing to do with
[1:42:45] this i don't think this is my business
[1:42:47] they begged me men of integrity that i
[1:42:50] love
[1:42:50] begged me to go and speak on their
[1:42:52] behalf at headquarters
[1:42:54] so i showed my boys the other day when
[1:42:56] we were coming through montgomery i said
[1:42:57] you see that building right there that's
[1:42:59] the building i had to go meet the
[1:43:01] overseers they call them superintendents
[1:43:04] then
[1:43:05] and i had to beg them to come and
[1:43:07] testify and i had a subpoena in case in
[1:43:10] case the begging didn't work i had
[1:43:11] subpoenas in my hand from the attorneys
[1:43:14] and they sat there and begged me not to
[1:43:16] subpoena them please do not force us to
[1:43:18] get involved and if you want basically
[1:43:20] if you want to hold your credentials
[1:43:22] then you will take that subpoena back
[1:43:24] with me and i said okay and tossed it in
[1:43:26] the floor in the trash tosses the bean
[1:43:28] and drastic i said just know this men
[1:43:30] and brethren just know this
[1:43:32] if you are not willing to stand for your
[1:43:34] church jesus will
[1:43:37] he'll stand for it
[1:43:39] and we'll be all right without you we'll
[1:43:40] call you and let you know how it all
[1:43:42] goes down
[1:43:43] and you know god was good to those
[1:43:45] people he helped them he helped us get
[1:43:47] through it
[1:43:48] and then the pressure started coming
[1:43:50] about what to preach and who could
[1:43:51] preach for us so i remember the day very
[1:43:54] well that i took my little plastic card
[1:43:56] i was so proud of uh uh licensed in the
[1:43:59] assemblies of god so proud of my little
[1:44:01] license
[1:44:02] i was so thankful to be able to go and
[1:44:04] lay that on brother comer's desk
[1:44:06] and i said you can't take from me what
[1:44:08] i'm giving you
[1:44:10] i'm more than delighted to hand it to
[1:44:12] you because you'll not be able to tell
[1:44:14] me what to preach
[1:44:15] you'll not be able to make me
[1:44:17] try to interpret how long is long and
[1:44:19] how short is short and i'll be able to
[1:44:22] ask whoever i desire as long as it's
[1:44:24] godly and right and the church is in
[1:44:25] agreement i won't have to just use your
[1:44:28] preachers
[1:44:29] i'll let the holy spirit lead and direct
[1:44:31] me and guide me and you know what i felt
[1:44:33] like a bird leaving there i wasn't ugly
[1:44:35] they weren't ugly to me but i felt like
[1:44:37] a little bird that'd been let out a cage
[1:44:39] you think i'd go get mixed up in babylon
[1:44:41] like that again i wouldn't want to get
[1:44:43] it mixed up in that for all the money in
[1:44:46] the world to be free to be free to be
[1:44:50] obedient to the lord and he has given me
[1:44:53] that freedom here and i don't take it
[1:44:55] lightly i'm thankful for it and so glad
[1:44:57] to be delivered from all of that stuff
[1:45:00] that likes to put the pressure on he's
[1:45:03] just a good god
[1:45:04] he's a good god he's going to see us
[1:45:07] through
[1:45:07] turn in your bibles
[1:45:09] uh to second don't rush me
[1:45:13] ii chronicles chapter 20
[1:45:17] uh
[1:45:19] beginning in verse one
[1:45:22] you stay awake too
[1:45:24] and if you've got somebody next to you
[1:45:25] sleepy see if you can help them say you
[1:45:27] couldn't be any sleeper than the
[1:45:29] preacher so
[1:45:30] you stay awake too we're in this thing
[1:45:32] together it's a it takes a team it takes
[1:45:34] a family
[1:45:36] to do it i
[1:45:37] my kids said last night they said daddy
[1:45:40] you've prayed for people all day long
[1:45:41] said i've never had
[1:45:43] no never known you to have so many calls
[1:45:45] for prayer but you know what that's what
[1:45:47] we do
[1:45:48] that's what we do because we know the
[1:45:50] power of god and we know how to call him
[1:45:53] on the scene
[1:45:54] and he comes how many of you believe he
[1:45:57] comes
[1:45:58] he doesn't play games with us
[1:46:00] he doesn't play hide and seek with his
[1:46:02] people he comes
[1:46:05] woo glory
[1:46:06] verse one it came to pass after this
[1:46:09] also
[1:46:10] that the children of moab and the
[1:46:12] children of ammon
[1:46:14] and with them other beside the ammonites
[1:46:17] came against jehoshaphat to battle
[1:46:21] and then there came some
[1:46:23] that told jehoshaphat saying there
[1:46:26] cometh a great multitude against thee
[1:46:29] from beyond the sea on this side syria
[1:46:33] and behold they be in
[1:46:36] tamar which is
[1:46:39] getty and gedi we know where that is
[1:46:42] many of us have been there together and
[1:46:45] jehoshaphat feared
[1:46:47] and set himself to seek the lord
[1:46:51] this was the king
[1:46:53] and the king was afraid but he didn't
[1:46:56] ring his hands all night hear what i'm
[1:46:59] saying
[1:47:00] he didn't look for a carnal way out to
[1:47:03] calm his fear
[1:47:05] he didn't look to the arms of flesh he
[1:47:08] looked to the lord
[1:47:10] he set himself to seek the lord
[1:47:14] and he proclaimed a fast throughout all
[1:47:20] judah
[1:47:21] israel was divided
[1:47:23] the nation of israel the nation of judah
[1:47:27] it was a divided house
[1:47:30] but god was about to do some things that
[1:47:33] are very supernatural
[1:47:35] and judith gathered themselves together
[1:47:39] to ask help of the lord hallelujah even
[1:47:43] out of all the cities of judah they came
[1:47:47] to seek the lord how many of you know
[1:47:49] it's powerful when people move together
[1:47:53] when they move together with a purpose
[1:47:56] then god can take people of limited
[1:47:59] means
[1:48:00] when they move together under the
[1:48:03] inspiration
[1:48:04] and leadership of the spirit god can
[1:48:07] move in those people and he can provide
[1:48:10] 206 497.26
[1:48:16] because the people heard the cry
[1:48:19] and they moved together
[1:48:22] now here is a biblical example
[1:48:24] of of of a king a leader calling the
[1:48:27] people together to seek the face of the
[1:48:29] lord and proclaiming a fast and they
[1:48:31] came in and stood in the congregation of
[1:48:35] judah and jerusalem in the house of the
[1:48:38] lord before the new court
[1:48:42] and said oh
[1:48:44] lord god
[1:48:46] of our fathers are you with me church
[1:48:49] art not thou god in heaven
[1:48:52] and rule us not thou over all the
[1:48:56] kingdoms of the heathen and in thine
[1:48:59] hand is there not power and might so
[1:49:03] that none is able to withstand thee does
[1:49:08] anybody hear the prayer strategy
[1:49:12] do you get it do you realize that they
[1:49:16] were preparing the heart of the lord
[1:49:19] they were reminding him of what he is
[1:49:23] capable of doing
[1:49:25] and so we could call this a praise
[1:49:28] moment
[1:49:29] because ever say oh god isn't there
[1:49:33] power
[1:49:34] and might in your hand
[1:49:36] so that none is able to withstand thee
[1:49:41] art not thou our god
[1:49:45] let's go let's stroll down memory lane
[1:49:48] who did us drive out the inhabitants of
[1:49:50] the land before thy people israel and
[1:49:54] gavest it to the seed of abraham thy
[1:49:57] friend forever
[1:50:00] and we're going to verse 13 and they
[1:50:02] dwelt therein and have built there a
[1:50:04] sanctuary therein for thy name saying
[1:50:08] if when evil cometh upon us as the sword
[1:50:11] judgment or pestilence or famine we
[1:50:15] stand oh hallelujah
[1:50:18] oh no matter what comes against us we
[1:50:21] know where to stand
[1:50:24] we stand before oh i don't know
[1:50:29] we stand before this house
[1:50:33] and in thy presence
[1:50:36] for thy name is in this house
[1:50:39] oh church we can't take it lightly where
[1:50:42] god desires to place his name when he
[1:50:46] puts his name there on his word it makes
[1:50:49] any old shed a holy place
[1:50:53] i told you about granny's honky tonk
[1:50:56] what made it holy was the name of the
[1:50:59] lord placed there it sanctified and set
[1:51:02] it apart
[1:51:04] oh for thy name is in this house and cry
[1:51:07] unto thee in our affliction then thou
[1:51:11] wilt hear and help
[1:51:14] oh lord
[1:51:16] hearing help
[1:51:17] whoa
[1:51:19] i was praying with sister anita on the
[1:51:20] phone last night when i hung up the
[1:51:22] phone the spirit of the lord came in the
[1:51:25] room again and i prayed out and that was
[1:51:28] exactly what i was saying forgetting
[1:51:30] about these words in my text but i said
[1:51:33] lord hear us
[1:51:35] and help
[1:51:38] hear us
[1:51:40] and help
[1:51:41] hallelujah and he does
[1:51:44] and now behold the children of ammon and
[1:51:46] moab and mount seir whom thou would hast
[1:51:49] not let israel invade when they came out
[1:51:51] of the land of egypt but they turned
[1:51:53] from them and destroyed them not behold
[1:51:58] i say how they reward us
[1:52:02] to come to cast us out of thy possession
[1:52:06] which thou has given us
[1:52:08] to inherit
[1:52:10] oh our god
[1:52:11] will thou not judge them for we have no
[1:52:14] might listen there's an enemy
[1:52:17] that we have no might against
[1:52:20] there are things that we have no control
[1:52:22] over
[1:52:23] there's diseases and things that we have
[1:52:25] no control over we can do the best we
[1:52:28] can but we have no power to flood it or
[1:52:30] to stop it and the best thing to do is
[1:52:32] just realize that in ourselves
[1:52:36] predominantly meaning in our flesh
[1:52:38] we have no power against this great
[1:52:40] company that cometh against us neither
[1:52:43] know we
[1:52:45] my god why don't you be honest
[1:52:48] why do you want to lie about it
[1:52:50] why don't you just tell it like it is we
[1:52:52] don't even know what to do
[1:52:56] we've done everything we know to do and
[1:52:58] we still don't know what to do
[1:53:00] but there's one thing we've we've got
[1:53:02] right
[1:53:05] we know where to look
[1:53:10] hallelujah
[1:53:12] our eyes are not cast down
[1:53:16] our eyes are turned to the hills
[1:53:20] to the mountains
[1:53:22] from where our help comes from
[1:53:24] our eyes are upon thee
[1:53:28] and all judah
[1:53:30] oh judah you remember who judah is don't

[1:56:30] zechariah the son of benanaya the son of
[1:56:33] jael the son of metania a levite of the
[1:56:36] sons of asaph

[1:56:57] my god is choosy about where he puts his
[1:57:00] spirit
[1:57:01] i'm very thankful that he put his spirit
[1:57:04] in the midst of this needy bunch of
[1:57:05] people that we're reading about now i'm
[1:57:08] very thankful
[1:57:10] that he came this morning and placed his
[1:57:12] spirit
[1:57:14] in the midst of a needy people
[1:57:16] because he said i tell you i feel
[1:57:18] something

[1:58:34] get excited about brother sister that's
[1:58:37] much

[1:58:40] going into any battle
[1:58:42] into any trial
[1:58:44] into any tough situation in lie it's a
[1:58:48] glorious thing to know that the battle
[1:58:50] doesn't belong to you
[1:58:53] but you have connected to the god of
[1:58:55] battles
[1:58:56] and he knows how to win
[1:58:58] oh
[1:59:00] he knows how to win for the battle is

[1:59:09] behold they come up by the cliff of zis
[1:59:12] and you shall find them at the end of
[1:59:15] the brook between the wilderness of urel
[1:59:19] you you shall not need to fight oh oh oh
[1:59:23] oh oh oh there's going to be a war
[1:59:25] there's going to be a battle you're
[1:59:27] surrounded by a multitude get your eyes
[1:59:29] off the multitude the battle doesn't
[1:59:31] belong to you the battle belongs to the
[1:59:34] lord
[1:59:35] you can't fix your family troubles the
[1:59:37] battle's not yours the battles the lords
[1:59:40] if you get out of the way quit putting
[1:59:42] your two cents in
[1:59:45] take them out you're broke you need them
[1:59:48] take your two cents right back and say
[1:59:50] this does not belong to me

[1:59:56] he knows how to right the wrong
[1:59:59] hear the word of the lord said you shall
[2:00:00] not need to fight in this battle set
[2:00:04] yourselves
[2:00:08] give me just a tad more in this monitor
[2:00:10] if you will because my voice is
[2:00:13] straining a bit
[2:00:14] set
[2:00:16] yourselves
[2:00:20] i want to make sure you understand
[2:00:22] that's an e
[2:00:24] and not an eye
[2:00:27] it didn't say sipped yourself
[2:00:31] now it's easy to do that
[2:00:33] when we get weary
[2:00:35] but it didn't say sit in the easy chair
[2:00:38] or the lazy boy and expect things to
[2:00:41] turn out all right
[2:00:43] it says set yourself up
[2:00:46] find the proper posture for your life in
[2:00:51] times like this and position yourselves
[2:00:55] right there
[2:00:57] set
[2:00:59] set yourself
[2:01:01] tune yourself
[2:01:03] you're setting the station you're
[2:01:06] setting the channel you're making sure
[2:01:09] that you're in the right place doing the
[2:01:12] right thing
[2:01:13] having the right posture
[2:01:17] not looking at your circumstances
[2:01:20] the bigness of your problem but looking
[2:01:23] at the bigness of your god
[2:01:25] focused on it
[2:01:27] focused on him
[2:01:29] and he said set yourselves
[2:01:33] three words read
[2:01:35] hardest three were hardest three words
[2:01:38] for warriors
[2:01:42] fighting in the spirit
[2:01:45] is just what we do
[2:01:48] it's who we are we deal with things not
[2:01:51] in the natural like people like to do
[2:01:55] we deal with things in the spiritual
[2:01:58] because what we have learned is if you
[2:02:00] try to solve a problem that's spiritual
[2:02:04] in a carnal way and with carnal
[2:02:06] technique
[2:02:08] you'll make more damage
[2:02:10] cause more confusion
[2:02:13] and shut up the heavens
[2:02:17] the one thing we don't want to do in
[2:02:18] this hour is offend the holy spirit and
[2:02:22] shut up the heavens
[2:02:24] we want to keep the heavens open over
[2:02:26] our lives over this house over our
[2:02:28] family because we have needs and we
[2:02:32] don't know how great the need might be
[2:02:34] we don't know what might come we don't
[2:02:35] know what we might face we don't know
[2:02:38] how we might feel pinned in
[2:02:41] him then surrounded by an enemy army and
[2:02:44] so in that hour we're going to need to
[2:02:46] make sure that there are no dead cats on
[2:02:48] the line
[2:02:50] and that we're keeping
[2:02:52] everything all right and one of the
[2:02:54] things to remember in times like this is
[2:02:57] praise is always the right response
[2:03:01] there's never a time that praising god
[2:03:03] is not the right response
[2:03:07] might be a little awkward
[2:03:10] the phone call come granny
[2:03:12] has drawn her last breath
[2:03:16] might be a little awkward
[2:03:19] but your response should be as david's
[2:03:22] was
[2:03:24] the lord be praised
[2:03:26] the lord be glorified
[2:03:29] the lord giveth and the lord taketh away
[2:03:31] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:03:33] it doesn't mean that we don't hurt it
[2:03:35] doesn't mean that we don't ache it
[2:03:36] doesn't mean that we don't understand
[2:03:37] the time
[2:03:39] but what it means is that praise and
[2:03:42] acknowledging the sovereignty of god
[2:03:44] through worship
[2:03:46] is always the right response
[2:03:48] you're never going to get in trouble
[2:03:50] giving god praise that he deserves
[2:03:52] can you help me a little bit
[2:03:54] you shall not need to fight in this
[2:03:56] battle set yourself make sure you're
[2:03:58] doing what you're supposed to do and
[2:04:00] then stand ye still
[2:04:03] don't get in god's way
[2:04:09] get out of your self-help book
[2:04:14] let the holy spirit lead you
[2:04:18] god didn't call this bride to be led
[2:04:21] forward by trinitarian theologian
[2:04:26] that's a little weak
[2:04:29] he didn't call his bride to be led
[2:04:31] forward by psychologists
[2:04:33] [Music]
[2:04:35] dr
[2:04:36] spocks
[2:04:38] he called his bride to be led forth by
[2:04:41] the spirit
[2:04:43] in the truth of the word
[2:04:46] you know brother branham said some
[2:04:47] powerful things about trying to divide
[2:04:49] the word from the spirit
[2:04:51] you can't do it
[2:04:53] you've got to have them both
[2:04:56] brother branham said if you take either
[2:04:57] the word or the spirit away from the
[2:05:00] people i'm paraphrasing now because i
[2:05:02] don't have the quote prepared
[2:05:04] he said if you take either the word or
[2:05:07] the spirit away from the people then you
[2:05:09] have to offer them some sort of
[2:05:11] substitute
[2:05:14] he said any form of substitution
[2:05:16] spells balaamism
[2:05:21] which is
[2:05:22] can be an illegal operation of a genuine
[2:05:24] gift
[2:05:25] you don't want that
[2:05:27] you don't want to try to illegally
[2:05:29] access a genuine gift
[2:05:32] you want to access it rightfully
[2:05:35] and legally by the course of heaven
[2:05:37] any mind with me
[2:05:39] and so this is what a lot of people have
[2:05:41] done they they have taken one
[2:05:44] and tried to leave the other
[2:05:46] the charismatic church has taken the
[2:05:48] spirit
[2:05:49] and tried to leave the word behind
[2:05:51] oh don't look at me like i don't know
[2:05:53] what i'm talking about i've been in
[2:05:55] their meeting
[2:05:56] i've sat in in their conferences and
[2:05:58] spoken at times with men who said it
[2:06:02] doesn't matter how you're baptized
[2:06:04] now is that not is that not taking away
[2:06:06] from the importance of the word
[2:06:08] didn't the word tell you how to be
[2:06:10] baptized
[2:06:14] your past folks on the way to church
[2:06:16] heading off to the baptist church
[2:06:19] or heading off to some denominational
[2:06:21] church somewhere and and i can't help in
[2:06:23] my mind but wonder how does somebody
[2:06:26] who has a revelation of jesus name
[2:06:29] baptism
[2:06:31] go sit in a lodge
[2:06:34] it's going to get quiet
[2:06:36] go sit in a lodge where god is divided
[2:06:38] into three pieces
[2:06:40] and where baptism is after the catholic
[2:06:42] church
[2:06:47] they do it because they're accepting one
[2:06:50] or the other
[2:06:52] and rejecting god's provided way
[2:06:55] and some are going to wake up
[2:06:57] and they're going to realize the hour
[2:06:59] that they're living in
[2:07:01] you know i i have friends around me
[2:07:04] who are saying to me often that that we
[2:07:07] are in the closing hours and i mean they
[2:07:09] said i'm not even saying days and months
[2:07:12] and year they've there are many friends
[2:07:14] and many people who believe the message
[2:07:16] of truth who are saying boldly that we
[2:07:19] are in the last hours
[2:07:21] of the coming of the lord
[2:07:23] that he is coming and that the rapture
[2:07:25] is closer that to us than we have ever
[2:07:28] even imagined that it was
[2:07:30] and you know what do you say i say be
[2:07:33] ready
[2:07:34] i say we better be ready for in such an
[2:07:36] hour as you think not
[2:07:39] i tell you it's not going to be the big
[2:07:41] the big announcement that a lot of
[2:07:42] people think it is
[2:07:44] so you can't take the word
[2:07:46] and just keep the gifts
[2:07:49] and the power and the spirit and the
[2:07:51] jerking
[2:07:53] and the and the goosebumps and the hair
[2:07:55] raising up and the sensations
[2:07:58] as brother branham would say you can't
[2:08:00] reject the word and take the oil in the
[2:08:02] hand and the blood in the hand
[2:08:05] you can't take some manifestation like
[2:08:08] gold dust or gold teeth or angel
[2:08:10] feathers or some of the things they talk
[2:08:12] about today
[2:08:14] you can't take that
[2:08:16] and reject the word
[2:08:18] and it is never a vindication of a man
[2:08:24] brother branham didn't need miracles to
[2:08:25] vindicate his ministry
[2:08:27] the vindication of his ministry was he
[2:08:29] stayed on the word
[2:08:31] and if you and i can stay on the word
[2:08:34] everything will be all right but you
[2:08:36] can't reject the spirit
[2:08:39] but you've got to have a taste of the
[2:08:40] original manna anybody listening boy i
[2:08:43] got to get to my notes
[2:08:45] but you've got to have a taste of the
[2:08:47] original manna every man
[2:08:49] who dare stand behind this sacred desk
[2:08:52] better know beyond the shadow of a doubt
[2:08:54] that he has tasted the original manna
[2:08:56] and not some kind of substitute or
[2:08:58] trusted in some kind of emotion or a
[2:09:01] feeling but he knows that he knows that
[2:09:03] he knows that he knows that he's had a
[2:09:04] taste of the original
[2:09:06] the holy ghost i'm telling you it's very
[2:09:08] very powerful and so what happens is
[2:09:11] some cling to the spirit and the gifts
[2:09:13] and the tongues
[2:09:15] and the feelings
[2:09:17] and then there are those and they reject
[2:09:19] the word don't matter what you believe
[2:09:20] they say oh doctrine i never been around
[2:09:23] people but i like this but was around
[2:09:25] some as i traveled not all of them but
[2:09:27] some of them as i traveled that doctrine
[2:09:30] was a curse word
[2:09:34] when i came around the message people
[2:09:35] some of them i found out that pentecost
[2:09:38] had become like a curse word and you had
[2:09:40] to be careful to justify it every time
[2:09:42] you said pentecost you had to make sure
[2:09:44] that you explained that you're talking
[2:09:45] about an experience and not a church or
[2:09:47] a denomination
[2:09:49] now i came around these folks and found
[2:09:51] out that the word doctrine has become a
[2:09:53] curse word
[2:09:54] and they see doctrine many of them as an
[2:09:57] obstacle
[2:10:00] something that stands in the way of
[2:10:02] spiritual freedom
[2:10:05] you know brother branham was a pretty
[2:10:07] smart man in the things of the spirit
[2:10:08] wasn't he because he actually saw a head
[2:10:11] he saw a day like this day where people
[2:10:14] would cling to the spirit and reject the
[2:10:16] word
[2:10:17] but he also said you can't take either
[2:10:19] one
[2:10:20] and reject the other they're together
[2:10:21] you take them together you receive
[2:10:23] together the word comes by the spirit
[2:10:27] the word is administered
[2:10:29] and appropriated
[2:10:31] and applied and delivered by the unction
[2:10:34] of the spirit or it's nothing but a dead
[2:10:37] dry letter
[2:10:38] produces more funerals than it does
[2:10:40] resurrections but you put the life with
[2:10:43] it i'm telling you you'll get a
[2:10:44] resurrection every now and again
[2:10:46] it's not all about funeral anymore it's
[2:10:49] about anaesthesias it's about a
[2:10:51] reproducible resurrection in the heart
[2:10:53] of a believer
[2:10:55] and that's what we're working toward
[2:10:57] anybody want to help me
[2:10:58] didn't mean to get into all that you
[2:11:00] shall not need to fight in this battle
[2:11:01] set yourselves stand ye still see the
[2:11:04] salvation of the lord with you oh judah
[2:11:07] and jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed
[2:11:10] tomorrow go out against them
[2:11:13] for the lord will be with you
[2:11:15] well let's read on and joshua that bowed
[2:11:17] his head with his face to the ground
[2:11:21] humbled himself the leadership got down
[2:11:24] on the ground
[2:11:26] and all judah and the inhabitants of
[2:11:29] jerusalem fell before the lord
[2:11:32] worshiping the lord
[2:11:34] now on the other hand of what i said
[2:11:35] just a moment ago you can't take the
[2:11:37] word
[2:11:40] and reject the spirit
[2:11:42] because the spirit prepares men's hearts
[2:11:45] to receive the word and the spirit helps
[2:11:48] to keep the church clean
[2:11:52] we got to have that we've got to have
[2:11:54] every administration of the spirit
[2:11:56] amen
[2:11:58] and the anointing is very very important
[2:12:00] because the anointing is not a feeling
[2:12:03] the anointing is not an emotion
[2:12:08] it doesn't even always sound the same
[2:12:11] i know people that try to discern the
[2:12:12] anointing by the sound it doesn't always
[2:12:15] sound the same
[2:12:18] sometimes it's like a lion on a hill
[2:12:21] roaring the word of the lord
[2:12:24] sometimes it's like a still small voice
[2:12:26] in the heart of a prophet
[2:12:28] be still be still be still but same same
[2:12:31] anointing
[2:12:32] same word same god same holy ghost no
[2:12:34] doubt about it joshua bowed his head to
[2:12:37] the ground with about his head with his
[2:12:39] face to the ground and all judah and the
[2:12:41] inhabitants of jerusalem fell before the
[2:12:43] lord worshipping the lord
[2:12:46] what a great posture
[2:12:48] and the levites and the children of the
[2:12:49] coethites and the children of the
[2:12:51] korites stood up
[2:12:53] to praise the lord
[2:12:55] god of israel
[2:12:58] we're the whisper because we don't want
[2:13:00] to disturb their church mice
[2:13:04] we don't want to disturb the sanctity of
[2:13:06] the word we don't want to disturb the
[2:13:08] sanctity of the house let me tell you
[2:13:10] something i can't speak for every house
[2:13:13] but this house wasn't built to be a
[2:13:16] mortuary
[2:13:21] yesterday in my memories i saw
[2:13:24] a photo that nathan had posted years
[2:13:27] after when
[2:13:28] because when the church was built we we
[2:13:31] there wasn't much social media to be had
[2:13:33] but years later he posted a picture
[2:13:36] of the uh promises of god and the
[2:13:39] prophetic words that had been spoken
[2:13:42] over our lives and this ministry
[2:13:45] had been buried in the foundation of
[2:13:48] this new building
[2:13:50] and before the concrete the cement was
[2:13:53] poured god's precious word and his
[2:13:56] precious promises to us we're laid in
[2:13:58] the foundation of this house i don't
[2:14:00] take that lightly
[2:14:02] that's a pretty powerful promise
[2:14:04] we're standing on his truth
[2:14:06] we're standing on his word unmovable
[2:14:09] unshakable in uncertain times like this
[2:14:12] we have an anchor hallelujah and we're
[2:14:14] still believing for the full fruition of
[2:14:16] everything that god has said
[2:14:19] hallelujah are you awake
[2:14:22] everything that god has said
[2:14:24] you've got to remember sometime you've
[2:14:26] got promises to fight for
[2:14:29] well i'm just going to sit back and see
[2:14:31] how it goes you're not a warrior then
[2:14:35] well i'm not going to sit back and see
[2:14:36] how it goes
[2:14:38] because i know what the enemy can do he
[2:14:40] can he can cause the whole train to
[2:14:41] derail
[2:14:43] you're just sitting back not warring
[2:14:44] you've got a war sometime you've got to
[2:14:46] stand up for the promises of god you've
[2:14:49] got to intercede and pray you've got to
[2:14:51] call on angel help lord i need angels
[2:14:55] don't say i just don't know you okay
[2:14:58] sit back and hope to come
[2:15:00] sometimes i have to say lord i need you
[2:15:02] to sin some more
[2:15:05] amen i don't have to see them i just
[2:15:08] need to know that the that the hills
[2:15:10] around us are full
[2:15:12] of angels fighting for us hallelujah
[2:15:16] there's more fighting for us
[2:15:19] than fighting against us
[2:15:21] spiritual
[2:15:23] when i caught a vision a few week couple
[2:15:24] weeks ago i caught a vision of the
[2:15:26] spiritual nature of the war
[2:15:30] between russia and
[2:15:32] and ukraine
[2:15:34] i know a little bit about it in the
[2:15:36] natural and read a little bit and looked
[2:15:37] at the history of it a little bit and
[2:15:39] saw exactly uh
[2:15:42] in in in repeat
[2:15:44] of what has already happened but in the
[2:15:47] spiritual it looks totally different
[2:15:49] than it looks in the natural
[2:15:51] and it's a train all right
[2:15:53] it's a train coming down the tracks at
[2:15:56] breakneck speed fulfilling the word of
[2:15:58] the lord
[2:15:59] and every time a picture comes up in my
[2:16:02] feet of an old granny with a lap blanket
[2:16:04] on and a wheelchair being wheeled off
[2:16:07] the airplane as a ukrainian refugee
[2:16:09] coming home to israel my heart leaps
[2:16:12] within me
[2:16:13] no wonder i got friends that say we're
[2:16:15] living in the last hours before the
[2:16:17] rapture
[2:16:18] we don't really believe that because if
[2:16:20] we did we'd be certainly living
[2:16:22] different in our private and personal
[2:16:23] life and it would certainly make a
[2:16:25] difference when we come together in the
[2:16:26] corporate world in the corporate church
[2:16:28] as a corporate body corporate body
[2:16:30] wouldn't it
[2:16:31] sure it would now let's read
[2:16:33] um they stood up to praise the lord
[2:16:36] the god of israel with a loud voice on
[2:16:39] high and that was verse 19. let's go to
[2:16:41] verse 20. you're still with me
[2:16:44] my my mind this is a very very long
[2:16:46] reading isn't it now we're going to read
[2:16:48] 20 to 30 10 more verses
[2:16:50] they rose early in the morning and went
[2:16:52] for and i'm not doing that because i
[2:16:54] don't have notes i've got plenty of
[2:16:55] notes
[2:16:56] and they rose early in the morning and
[2:16:58] went forth into the wilderness of tekoa
[2:17:00] and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood
[2:17:03] and said hear me o judah and ye
[2:17:05] inhabitants of jerusalem
[2:17:07] believe in the lord your god
[2:17:10] so shall ye be established believe his
[2:17:15] prophets
[2:17:16] so shall ye prosper
[2:17:20] let me tell you this
[2:17:22] any man or woman who's willing to
[2:17:24] acknowledge that god sent a prophet that
[2:17:27] brother branham is a prophet sent from
[2:17:29] god
[2:17:31] any man who's willing to swim woman
[2:17:34] a two that's willing to swim against the
[2:17:36] tide of popular opinion and swim against
[2:17:39] the tide of google searches
[2:17:42] and recognize in their heart not because
[2:17:44] mama said it or daddy said it but come
[2:17:47] to their own revelation and
[2:17:49] understanding
[2:17:50] and you believe the message that he
[2:17:52] brought as it lays in the absolute
[2:17:55] foundation of the word you are promised
[2:17:58] a prosperity
[2:18:00] that the world can never offer you
[2:18:03] believe his pr
[2:18:05] but don't miss the s
[2:18:11] don't miss the ass
[2:18:13] because god still speaks
[2:18:16] believe his prophets saw
[2:18:18] and this particular verse doesn't
[2:18:20] distinguish between one whose ministry
[2:18:23] is prophesied in the word and one who's
[2:18:24] not
[2:18:25] it doesn't distinguish between what they
[2:18:28] like to call a word prophet in a new
[2:18:29] testament or an old testament prophet
[2:18:31] and a new testament prophet there was no
[2:18:32] new testament here of course i
[2:18:34] understand that
[2:18:35] but it just says but and only one
[2:18:37] prophet was prophesying to joshua
[2:18:39] but the s is here believe is prophet so
[2:18:42] shall ye prosper it's like revelation 10
[2:18:46] where they where they get that s a
[2:18:48] little mixed up sometime put the s in
[2:18:49] the wrong place when they're preaching
[2:18:51] revelation 10 don't do that
[2:18:54] understand that god knows exactly where
[2:18:56] his children are today he knows exactly
[2:18:59] how to reach him with his word
[2:19:01] he's doing it in profound ways so
[2:19:03] believe his prophets and so shall you
[2:19:05] prosper the king is decreeing and
[2:19:07] declaring this over the people let's
[2:19:09] read on and when he had consulted with
[2:19:12] the people
[2:19:16] he appointed cannons
[2:19:20] catapults
[2:19:25] what kind of king is this
[2:19:28] he was looking for the opera singers
[2:19:32] bring in the singers
[2:19:35] and he appointed singers unto the lord
[2:19:38] they sang for a solid 55
[2:19:43] minutes this morning
[2:19:48] did we stop
[2:19:50] at 55
[2:19:54] you go back in
[2:19:55] time and on the stream because if we
[2:19:58] stopped at 55 we'll do 60 next time
[2:20:03] if god is in it
[2:20:06] there's only one limit here
[2:20:09] and that's the mind of god
[2:20:11] let the mind of god limit it
[2:20:15] no disrespect
[2:20:17] to three songs
[2:20:21] no disrespect
[2:20:23] sometimes that's all you need
[2:20:25] amen
[2:20:27] but let me tell you something god
[2:20:29] himself
[2:20:30] knows the importance
[2:20:33] of what singing does
[2:20:35] you like i said last sunday you don't
[2:20:37] even have to be able to sing
[2:20:40] the same
[2:20:41] you just start making melody in your
[2:20:43] heart and it starts coming out your
[2:20:44] mouth
[2:20:46] come on now and what an atmosphere so
[2:20:49] the king said i'm going to put this in
[2:20:50] order here and i'm going to first thing
[2:20:52] i'm going to do is i want you you you
[2:20:54] and you
[2:21:01] i know how olivia got up there out here
[2:21:04] the last time i wouldn't got her
[2:21:06] and i did it under the inspiration of
[2:21:08] the holy spirit
[2:21:10] and i didn't know that brother greeley
[2:21:11] was standing over there in the corner
[2:21:12] hidden and interceding for them as they
[2:21:14] as they sung i didn't know that
[2:21:16] and i felt bad a little bit as i as i
[2:21:19] did in fact i said to brother greeley
[2:21:20] later i didn't do that to get her away
[2:21:22] from your prayer
[2:21:24] i didn't even see you there i did that
[2:21:26] because i could feel the enemy
[2:21:29] and i wanted to show the enemy
[2:21:32] by the way the enemy doesn't wear
[2:21:34] britches
[2:21:36] or a skirt
[2:21:38] i'm not talking about people
[2:21:42] don't you dare misunderstand that i
[2:21:45] don't know how she got up here today i
[2:21:46] was back there praying you brought her
[2:21:50] somebody said i just don't like one
[2:21:52] being elevated over the other or or
[2:21:55] stuck out there in front of the other
[2:21:58] even one person said i don't think we
[2:22:00] need three
[2:22:02] backup singers
[2:22:07] one of the churches that i i listen to
[2:22:10] sometime
[2:22:12] i ain't going to talk about it because
[2:22:13] it's not a message church and i know
[2:22:15] that some people think nothing good
[2:22:16] could ever go on in a church that wasn't
[2:22:18] a message church but it keeps me going
[2:22:21] many times
[2:22:22] they keep me going and you know what
[2:22:24] they come out there's about 10 or 12 13
[2:22:26] 14 of them
[2:22:29] they're not they're backing nobody
[2:22:30] they're they're leading away
[2:22:33] boy sometimes i get excited they call it
[2:22:35] a team and i've heard people even around
[2:22:37] the messages say praise team
[2:22:42] you ought to be careful
[2:22:44] don't you know the word
[2:22:47] don't you know that jehoshaphat got up
[2:22:50] that day he didn't just say all right
[2:22:51] who wants to sing
[2:22:53] the bible said he appointed singers unto
[2:22:58] the lord
[2:23:01] he did it with leadership he did it with
[2:23:05] strategy
[2:23:07] because there was a war
[2:23:10] there was a war that had to be won and
[2:23:13] this time it wasn't going to be one with
[2:23:14] swords
[2:23:16] it was going to be one with songs
[2:23:22] ain't that good
[2:23:25] isn't that great
[2:23:27] it sure is
[2:23:29] oh he said he appointed singers unto the
[2:23:31] lord and that should praise the beauty
[2:23:36] of holiness
[2:23:40] holiness
[2:23:42] i believe in holiness
[2:23:44] but the holiness i believe in is his
[2:23:47] and the only holiness you've got is the
[2:23:49] one he lets you have
[2:23:52] he puts that on you
[2:23:54] now i've already spoken recently about
[2:23:56] modesty and i believe in modesty
[2:24:00] i believe the church women of this world
[2:24:02] would be better served and would better
[2:24:04] serve the kingdom of god
[2:24:07] if they would dress more appropriately
[2:24:09] in his house and out there in the world
[2:24:12] and they would be doing it if it wasn't
[2:24:14] for part of that women's lib thing you
[2:24:16] know that gets up and says the man is
[2:24:18] responsible because they believe the
[2:24:20] woman gets blamed for everything so they
[2:24:22] say that the man is the one that is
[2:24:24] responsible but brother branham came and
[2:24:26] put that in balance
[2:24:29] and he said clearly that a woman who
[2:24:31] showed her underneath garments
[2:24:36] it's quiet
[2:24:38] he said a woman that showed her
[2:24:40] underneath garments
[2:24:41] that means foundations that means things
[2:24:43] that are underneath
[2:24:45] to serve you
[2:24:47] not for me to see
[2:24:53] where will he go where will he go where
[2:24:55] will he go that means every strap
[2:24:58] every clasp
[2:25:00] every bit of it it's underneath garment
[2:25:03] people shouldn't be walking around with
[2:25:04] their underwear showing
[2:25:06] right
[2:25:08] he said if they if you do that
[2:25:11] if you go out and you're and you've got
[2:25:13] your underneath garment showing and he
[2:25:15] said that right there is enough
[2:25:18] then a man see that lust in his heart
[2:25:22] you're going to be also held responsible
[2:25:24] just telling you the balance you don't
[2:25:26] believe that do you brother shelly i
[2:25:28] certainly
[2:25:30] do
[2:25:30] [Music]
[2:25:31] now a man ought to know his limitations
[2:25:34] he ought to know what belongs to him and
[2:25:36] what doesn't belong to him he ought to
[2:25:38] be especially a godly man a church man
[2:25:41] ought to be able to control his urges
[2:25:45] and deal with his lust
[2:25:47] right
[2:25:48] i believe that with all my heart
[2:25:52] because it's not it's not we're not
[2:25:54] immune to it here
[2:25:56] i've seen men watch women go down the
[2:25:59] aisle that didn't belong to them right
[2:26:01] here
[2:26:04] because men are men and women are women
[2:26:06] and human nature it's human nature
[2:26:09] and so everybody's got to deal with that
[2:26:12] amen
[2:26:14] so a sister needs to tuck it in
[2:26:18] covered up
[2:26:20] amen
[2:26:22] and a man you need to control your eyes
[2:26:27] women too
[2:26:28] thank you
[2:26:30] they're preaching in the pews now
[2:26:45] ain't it the truth
[2:26:52] because it's my place to handle the word
[2:26:55] and not a sister
[2:26:57] i'm going to repeat what it was saying
[2:26:59] because i believe it's absolutely the
[2:27:01] truth
[2:27:02] a man should also not and let me tell
[2:27:04] you something sister it don't have to
[2:27:06] just be skinny jeans
[2:27:08] i've seen men in full cut jeans that
[2:27:10] needed a bigger size
[2:27:13] so it's not just about how the legs look
[2:27:16] it's about the whole whole thing
[2:27:18] and so that's right if you find yourself
[2:27:21] dressing that way to attract attention
[2:27:24] somebody said i do that for my wife well
[2:27:27] your wife is not the only one out there
[2:27:29] or i do that for my husband your husband
[2:27:31] is not the one i don't even think these
[2:27:32] things ought to be preached well folks
[2:27:36] too bad
[2:27:39] because we're living in an hour where we
[2:27:42] have to be reminded
[2:27:44] you say amen owe me whatever you need to
[2:27:46] say
[2:27:48] all right now when he had consulted with
[2:27:50] the people he appointed singers unto the
[2:27:52] lord that they should praise the beauty
[2:27:54] of holiness
[2:27:57] and holiness is not something that can
[2:27:58] be legislated
[2:28:01] i would like to say one more thing while
[2:28:02] we're on the subject and that is the
[2:28:04] scripture that we look to in deuteronomy
[2:28:06] 22 and 5
[2:28:08] is not distinguishing particularly or
[2:28:11] exclusively
[2:28:12] between a skirt or a pair of pants
[2:28:16] it says pertains to
[2:28:21] i've seen women in combat boots
[2:28:25] i've seen women in shoes that look like
[2:28:27] men's shoes and men and shoes that look
[2:28:29] like women's shoes there are things that
[2:28:31] we need to be thoughtful of
[2:28:33] in a wicked hour
[2:28:35] like the one we're living in now
[2:28:37] it says pertains to so you let the holy
[2:28:40] spirit direct you and lead you
[2:28:44] and he will
[2:28:46] you mad at me
[2:28:48] i didn't hear anybody say yes
[2:28:51] that don't mean they're not does it
[2:28:53] it's true anyhow
[2:28:54] praise the beauty of holiness as they
[2:28:56] went out before the army
[2:28:59] before the army
[2:29:01] before the army
[2:29:03] before the army
[2:29:05] and here's what the singers are to do
[2:29:07] say praise the lord
[2:29:10] for his mercy and do it forever talk
[2:29:11] about vain repetition
[2:29:13] praise the lord first mercy and do it
[2:29:15] forever praise the lord for his mercy
[2:29:16] and doeth the river praise the lord
[2:29:17] verse mercy and dirt forever praise the
[2:29:19] lord verse mercy and death forever
[2:29:21] praise the lord verse of mercy under
[2:29:22] favor
[2:29:24] judah first
[2:29:26] praise the lord for his mercy and death
[2:29:28] forever praise the lord first mercy and
[2:29:30] death forever
[2:29:32] then the army comes behind
[2:29:34] and they were ready to do battle they
[2:29:36] were ready to do the bloody stuff
[2:29:38] but praise went first
[2:29:42] praise had to go first praise has to go
[2:29:46] first praise has to be preeminent in an
[2:29:49] hour like that got to go forward got to
[2:29:51] go first
[2:29:53] i tell people praise before you pray
[2:29:57] jesus did
[2:29:59] our father who art in heaven hallowed be
[2:30:01] thy name
[2:30:03] he came praising before he came
[2:30:05] petitioning
[2:30:08] never gonna go wrong with that let's
[2:30:09] read on i gotta hurry
[2:30:11] and when they began to begin to sing and
[2:30:14] to praise
[2:30:15] the
[2:30:16] lord i'ma look around now and see who's
[2:30:19] sleeping
[2:30:20] the lord
[2:30:24] set ambushments
[2:30:27] against the children of ammon and moab
[2:30:29] and mount seer which will come against
[2:30:30] judah and they were
[2:30:39] there were some angels doing war
[2:30:42] there were some holy god
[2:30:44] ambushments that were set against those
[2:30:47] enemies
[2:30:48] that brought destruction
[2:30:50] and it wasn't because judah had a mighty
[2:30:52] army
[2:30:53] it was because the right protocol was
[2:30:55] was used
[2:30:57] praise went
[2:30:58] first praise the lord for his mercy and
[2:31:01] do it forever hallelujah
[2:31:04] for his mercy and death forever first
[2:31:06] mercy and do it forever
[2:31:08] let's read on a little bit more all the
[2:31:09] way to 30.
[2:31:11] uh yeah 30. and when they began to sing
[2:31:14] i'll do this one again and when they
[2:31:15] began to sing and to praise the lord the
[2:31:17] lord set ambushments against the
[2:31:18] children of ammon moab and mount seir
[2:31:20] which are come against judah and they
[2:31:23] were smitten
[2:31:25] for the children of ammon and moab stood
[2:31:27] against the inhabitants of mount seir
[2:31:29] what
[2:31:32] to slay utterly to slay and destroy them
[2:31:36] and when they had made an end of the
[2:31:38] inhabitants of seer everyone helped too
[2:31:43] you see what the lord did
[2:31:45] he blocked their path
[2:31:47] he blocked their plans
[2:31:49] he confused their their their military
[2:31:51] strategies their generals got confused
[2:31:54] everybody got confused they didn't know
[2:31:55] what to do next they are not used to a
[2:31:58] singing shouting dancing praising army
[2:32:04] if they'd have come out there ready to
[2:32:06] do battle they'd have met him right down
[2:32:07] towing the line
[2:32:09] but they did not know what to do with
[2:32:10] the people
[2:32:11] that wouldn't do anything
[2:32:13] until they praise the lord
[2:32:15] i'm telling you the world around you are
[2:32:17] you with me
[2:32:18] the world around you doesn't know what
[2:32:20] to do with somebody that meets every
[2:32:21] situation by praising the lord they
[2:32:23] don't know what to do
[2:32:25] with somebody that praises the lord in
[2:32:27] every situation you know at all times no
[2:32:30] matter what the enemy tries to do they
[2:32:32] don't know what to do with you
[2:32:34] all right let's read on
[2:32:36] and when judah came toward the
[2:32:38] watchtower in the wilderness they looked
[2:32:40] under the multitude and behold they were
[2:32:42] dead
[2:32:43] bodies fallen to the earth and none
[2:32:45] escaped
[2:32:46] every enemy slain
[2:32:49] because they slayed
[2:32:50] themselves they put themselves
[2:32:54] god's the people praised
[2:32:56] god set ambushments the people killed
[2:32:59] one another enemy against enemy they
[2:33:01] defeated each other fell all of them
[2:33:03] none escaped let's read on and when
[2:33:06] jehoshaphat and his people came to take
[2:33:08] away the spoil of them
[2:33:10] they found among them in abundance
[2:33:13] both riches with dead bodies and
[2:33:14] precious jewels which they stripped off
[2:33:17] for themselves more than they could
[2:33:19] carry away
[2:33:22] [Music]
[2:33:24] praise releases abundance
[2:33:27] [Applause]
[2:33:29] it does
[2:33:31] it releases abundance
[2:33:34] it releases favor
[2:33:36] more than they could carry away and they
[2:33:39] and they were what
[2:33:41] three days
[2:33:44] in gathering of the spoil it was so much
[2:33:48] wasn't god good
[2:33:50] he just delivered the riches right into
[2:33:52] their hands by setting ambushments
[2:33:54] against the enemy and causing them to
[2:33:56] destroy themselves let's read on
[2:33:59] and on the fourth day they assembled
[2:34:01] themselves in the valley of baracha
[2:34:04] for there they blessed the lord that's
[2:34:06] the valley of blessing
[2:34:08] for there they blessed the lord
[2:34:10] therefore the name of the same place was
[2:34:13] called the valley of barack unto this
[2:34:15] day
[2:34:16] glory
[2:34:17] glory let's read on
[2:34:21] and then they returned every man of
[2:34:22] judah and jerusalem and jehoshaphat in
[2:34:25] the forefront of them to go again to
[2:34:27] jerusalem
[2:34:29] [Music]
[2:34:31] how'd they go
[2:34:33] for the lord had made them to rejoice
[2:34:35] over their enemies
[2:34:38] [Music]
[2:34:40] here they are praising the lord and the
[2:34:42] lord turned their praise in such a
[2:34:44] manner that they were rejoicing over
[2:34:46] their enemies and getting their pockets
[2:34:49] filled with spoil
[2:34:51] and they came to jerusalem with psalter
[2:34:57] the church of christ wouldn't like this
[2:35:01] they came with musical instruments
[2:35:04] how worldly
[2:35:05] sultries and harps and trumpets
[2:35:09] now trumpet is not a soft instrument
[2:35:14] salt trees and harps and trumpets
[2:35:18] but they knew better than to disturb the
[2:35:21] sanctity of the house of the lord
[2:35:23] so they did this all in the parking lot
[2:35:28] they had a pavilion they pitched a tent
[2:35:31] and they sung praises outside and played
[2:35:33] the trumpets and harps and had a great
[2:35:35] time but when they come into the house
[2:35:37] of the lord they all folded their hands
[2:35:40] and waited for the preacher
[2:35:42] no that's not what it says at all
[2:35:44] the joy that brought them down from the
[2:35:46] battlefield went with them into the
[2:35:48] house of god
[2:35:52] you hear me anybody hear me
[2:35:54] what they had just seen the lord do then
[2:35:57] they didn't come to church and sit on
[2:35:58] their hands
[2:36:00] stuff their mouth
[2:36:04] they brought that joy all the way in
[2:36:08] to the house of the lord
[2:36:11] and begin to play these instruments unto
[2:36:13] god
[2:36:15] read on
[2:36:18] the fear of god
[2:36:21] was on all the kingdoms of these
[2:36:22] countries those countries when they had
[2:36:24] heard that the lord fought the lord
[2:36:26] fought the lord fought the lord fought
[2:36:29] the lord fought against the enemies of
[2:36:32] israel and all they did was praise
[2:36:35] all they did was set themselves with the
[2:36:37] right heart or right attitude a right
[2:36:39] spirit
[2:36:40] they let god do the fighting
[2:36:42] now they they were very much involved
[2:36:45] they fought with the song
[2:36:47] they fought by declaring the word of god
[2:36:50] by declaring the word of the lord
[2:36:52] hallelujah and when the enemies around
[2:36:55] and the countries that surrounded they
[2:36:57] began to hear that the lord fought
[2:36:58] against the enemies of israel i want you
[2:37:00] to know it changed a lot of people's
[2:37:02] opinions didn't it is that the last one
[2:37:05] no we got one more don't we so the realm
[2:37:08] of jehoshaphat was quiet
[2:37:12] wouldn't that be lovely
[2:37:16] oh it wasn't for you you wouldn't like a
[2:37:18] little quiet
[2:37:20] wouldn't you like
[2:37:21] four or five days without battle without
[2:37:23] opposition without fighting something
[2:37:26] through in the spirit without getting
[2:37:28] whacked upside the head in the spirit
[2:37:29] world not knowing what it's all about
[2:37:31] wondering what you're going through and
[2:37:33] what somebody else is going through and
[2:37:36] i reached out to somebody this week and
[2:37:38] i said i know that we had a we had an
[2:37:40] appointment to speak in a few days but i
[2:37:42] can't take it anymore
[2:37:44] i need to speak to you now because
[2:37:47] you're you're getting heavy and i'm
[2:37:48] getting tired of carrying you like this
[2:37:50] load is heavy and i believe i can get
[2:37:52] some of this lifted if we just speak
[2:37:54] them in it
[2:37:55] and you know god gave us an opportunity
[2:37:57] to do that and and it helped relieve
[2:37:59] some of that pressure because god will
[2:38:01] lay an assignment on you and it'll
[2:38:04] consume you
[2:38:06] anybody understand
[2:38:07] it will consume you
[2:38:10] somebody thanks me for watching in
[2:38:11] prayer but i want to tell you that the
[2:38:13] truth is there were there were many
[2:38:16] watchmen on the wall with me last night
[2:38:19] in that good the goodness of god
[2:38:22] and the provision of god
[2:38:24] that we didn't have to pray it alone
[2:38:27] but others were also praying
[2:38:31] maybe some didn't even know why
[2:38:34] when we started talking about not
[2:38:36] sleeping
[2:38:37] well last night or not getting much rest
[2:38:39] over others who might not have even
[2:38:40] known the intensity of the battle or
[2:38:42] what was really going on but many said i
[2:38:45] didn't rest well either
[2:38:48] it's just because things get stirred up
[2:38:50] in that other dimension and in that
[2:38:52] other realm
[2:38:54] and that's why the prayers that that go
[2:38:57] forth from this house
[2:38:59] and from this property are very very
[2:39:02] vital and important prayers
[2:39:04] so those of you that have been meeting
[2:39:06] weekly and and praying in the parking
[2:39:09] lot or wherever you find your assignment
[2:39:12] on this property thank you for doing
[2:39:14] that and and the prayer chapels are
[2:39:16] there and even during renovation you
[2:39:19] could go into the sisters brother
[2:39:21] greeley told you that even though
[2:39:22] there's some storage in there because
[2:39:24] the men's uh it's cleaned out but but
[2:39:27] you don't have to be yesterday was the
[2:39:29] day you didn't have to be locked inside
[2:39:30] to pray
[2:39:32] it was so beautiful outside
[2:39:34] and every time you send a prayer up it
[2:39:37] helps to ease some of that load and some
[2:39:39] of that burden and what we call some of
[2:39:41] that swirl that takes place
[2:39:44] because when god's people pray there are
[2:39:47] armies that are activated in both realms
[2:39:51] when god's people pray i hear sister
[2:39:53] anita
[2:39:54] as i said that i can hear her song
[2:39:59] praise puts him out of his mind
[2:40:06] so what are we doing praise him for the
[2:40:07] victory
[2:40:10] praise him for the victory
[2:40:14] the weapons that we use are not bombs
[2:40:16] and guns
[2:40:18] worship is the way that the battle is
[2:40:21] won
[2:40:22] oh
[2:40:24] hallelujah
[2:40:27] [Applause]
[2:40:28] [Music]

[2:45:48] a tambourine
[2:45:50] and begin to beat it
[2:45:55] [Music]
[2:46:07] very dignified
[2:46:10] but brother she didn't just scream she
[2:46:12] screamed beat the tambourine and danced
[2:46:18] and ran down the bank
[2:46:23] think about it just think about it the
[2:46:25] women followed her
[2:46:30] and they were doing the very same thing
[2:46:33] oh i guess i can do it all i don't know
[2:46:35] if i'm that coordinated or not glory
[2:46:38] glory glory glory glory glory glory
[2:46:40] glory
[2:46:41] that's what they did
[2:46:44] that is what they did
[2:46:52] what they did
[2:46:53] and brother branham wasn't out of the
[2:46:55] word
[2:46:56] he was talk taken
[2:46:58] quoting just what the word said
[2:47:01] exodus 15 20.
[2:47:03] and miriam the prophetess
[2:47:11] [Music]
[2:47:13] better not touch that with the 10-foot
[2:47:15] pole
[2:47:16] let's
[2:47:18] let's
[2:47:20] you think only men can prophesy
[2:47:24] you think only men can hear the word of
[2:47:26] the lord
[2:47:27] then we'd be in trouble in this house
[2:47:31] i don't believe
[2:47:33] that only men can have the word of the
[2:47:35] lord
[2:47:37] neither did brother annam
[2:47:41] he mentioned sister argan bride he
[2:47:43] mentioned several
[2:47:45] in the church that had the gift of
[2:47:47] interpretation when tongues are
[2:47:49] interpreted he said that becomes
[2:47:50] prophecy
[2:47:53] i understand there's a difference in the
[2:47:55] gift of prophecy and the and the office
[2:47:57] of a prophet
[2:47:59] i totally understand that but here is a
[2:48:02] a woman a sister who who was not perfect
[2:48:08] she got in some big
[2:48:10] trouble didn't she
[2:48:12] but this day
[2:48:15] this day
[2:48:16] the joy of the lord overwhelmed her and
[2:48:19] the word of the lord began to pour out
[2:48:21] of her mouth and even moses
[2:48:24] the staunch prophet of god
[2:48:26] even moses began to sing a spiritual
[2:48:29] song one that had never been sung before
[2:48:32] whoa my my my my my well that was all
[2:48:37] testament
[2:48:41] praise doesn't know a difference between
[2:48:44] old testament and new testament
[2:48:47] [Applause]
[2:48:49] just like that quote i read you a minute
[2:48:51] ago from thirst is 1965 september the
[2:48:54] 19th
[2:48:56] 1965 so evidently speaking in tongues
[2:48:59] does not know an exploration in 1963
[2:49:04] i know everybody didn't get that but for
[2:49:06] those of you who know you know
[2:49:09] tongues didn't expire
[2:49:12] when the word was revealed
[2:49:15] joy bells didn't expire
[2:49:18] when the word was revealed
[2:49:19] dancing before the lord didn't expire
[2:49:25] i don't see here where the spirit of god
[2:49:27] moved on miriam and all she could do was
[2:49:29] dance
[2:49:30] i don't see where god jerked her around
[2:49:32] and then and we can say that the spirit
[2:49:34] of the lord took charge and took control
[2:49:36] and she had no choice
[2:49:39] the word just doesn't say that
[2:49:41] it says in miriam the prophetess the
[2:49:43] sister of aaron took a timbrel
[2:49:46] in her hand and all the women went out
[2:49:49] after her with timbrels
[2:49:52] and
[2:49:52] with dances
[2:49:58] i know what people say i'm closing after
[2:50:00] a while
[2:50:02] i know what people say
[2:50:04] they say that's jewish
[2:50:05] culture
[2:50:11] mighty interesting to me that on the day
[2:50:12] of pentecost there were a lot of
[2:50:14] gentiles gathered there
[2:50:16] and they must have learned the hebrew
[2:50:18] culture in a hurry because when the holy
[2:50:20] ghost fell on them they start staggering
[2:50:22] around like drunk men speaking in other
[2:50:24] tongues just tell them what the word
[2:50:25] said
[2:50:27] it wasn't a purty dance like miriam's
[2:50:30] but it was a dance none the same
[2:50:33] because they couldn't hold their selves
[2:50:35] up steady
[2:50:38] because that which had been prophesied
[2:50:44] oh
[2:50:45] who could contain the joy
[2:50:47] of knowing that you're living in a day
[2:50:50] when the word of the lord has been
[2:50:53] fulfilled
[2:50:55] that'll make everybody have a little joy
[2:50:58] to know that you're living in the
[2:51:00] consummation of the ages
[2:51:03] that the word is restored and revealed
[2:51:05] and made known that didn't ought to make
[2:51:07] anybody get a little happy with it oh
[2:51:09] back to the quote thank you the women
[2:51:11] followed her doing the same thing and
[2:51:13] moses threw up his hands and sang in the
[2:51:15] spirit
[2:51:25] stay with me stay with me just stay with
[2:51:27] me
[2:51:35] i'm moses
[2:51:44] see my finger i'm praising
[2:51:50] it got so good
[2:51:53] that the preacher got involved
[2:51:58] the prophet couldn't keep himself
[2:52:00] oh i wish you'd look at me like you
[2:52:02] don't like me
[2:52:05] because i got a quote for you
[2:52:08] he couldn't help himself
[2:52:13] it wasn't just miriam's enemy floating
[2:52:15] in the water
[2:52:18] it was the enemy of all israel
[2:52:21] [Applause]
[2:52:24] oh
[2:52:25] i believe anybody that could see the
[2:52:27] devil floating in the pond would get
[2:52:29] excited about it
[2:52:31] [Music]
[2:52:32] if you could realize that he is defeated
[2:52:37] [Applause]
[2:52:40] you'd find a spring
[2:52:43] in your step
[2:52:45] hallelujah
[2:52:47] hallelujah
[2:52:48] and moses
[2:52:51] go back uh
[2:52:53] moses threw up his hands
[2:52:58] and sang
[2:53:00] in the spirit
[2:53:04] and we've got some of the we got some of
[2:53:06] the words
[2:53:07] of the song of moses it's in the bible
[2:53:10] we know some of the things that moses
[2:53:12] sung
[2:53:13] in prophetic praise
[2:53:15] oh
[2:53:17] hallelujah to the lamb thank you i'll
[2:53:19] read on now
[2:53:21] 75 at pentecost
[2:53:35] 120 million
[2:53:40] brother branham says
[2:53:41] the women come out
[2:53:44] staggering
[2:53:52] i don't know where they was
[2:53:54] they must have been peeking in the
[2:53:55] windows
[2:53:57] and got under the inspiration they must
[2:53:59] have been like them old drunks
[2:54:02] at azusa
[2:54:04] street that used to get down like this
[2:54:07] and peer in the lock holes
[2:54:11] of the old door of the old livery stable
[2:54:13] so they could look in and see them
[2:54:15] pentecostals jerking around
[2:54:19] in time after i feel the holy ghost
[2:54:23] and time after time after time after
[2:54:25] time the spirit of god would come right
[2:54:27] through that keyhole
[2:54:31] any good
[2:54:33] any good
[2:54:35] god didn't send the holy ghost to keep
[2:54:37] him in a box
[2:54:41] god didn't send the holy ghost to lock
[2:54:43] it up in the upper room either
[2:54:46] he didn't send the holy ghost to keep it
[2:54:48] in azusa street
[2:54:50] he sent the holy ghost to let it go out
[2:54:54] and go out and go out and bring in those
[2:54:58] that the spirit is calling
[2:55:00] three 000 in one day
[2:55:03] go get them holy ghost go get them holy
[2:55:05] ghost
[2:55:06] go get them
[2:55:11] so somewhere the women was around
[2:55:14] they come out staggering and jumping
[2:55:17] that is definitely not ladylike
[2:55:21] they were jumping like olympic
[2:55:25] jumpers
[2:55:27] whoa glory be to god
[2:55:29] you know how brother came in and kind of
[2:55:32] made a lot of the kangaroo
[2:55:34] anointing
[2:55:35] you just let me be a kangaroo
[2:55:39] because i understand there was kangaroos
[2:55:41] on the day of pentecost
[2:55:43] because the prophet who had the mind of
[2:55:45] god he could look all the way back and
[2:55:46] describe the scene
[2:55:48] you either believe that or you don't i
[2:55:50] do
[2:55:50] and here's what he said they were
[2:55:52] staggering
[2:55:55] and
[2:55:56] jumping and dancing
[2:56:01] and what is carrying on me i don't know
[2:56:03] what that means
[2:56:04] carrying on
[2:56:07] peter stood up
[2:56:09] in the midst of them
[2:56:11] and recognize
[2:56:12] this isn't trash
[2:56:17] this isn't wildfire
[2:56:20] this is not a bunch of maniacs
[2:56:24] this isn't people who despise the word
[2:56:28] or reject the message
[2:56:35] well they might have been pentecostal
[2:56:37] babies they could have been
[2:56:39] because you got to be a baby before you
[2:56:41] can walk
[2:56:44] hallelujah
[2:56:46] but there's a few things you don't want
[2:56:47] to lose
[2:56:48] as you mature you don't want to lose
[2:56:50] your praise
[2:56:52] you don't want to trade your freedom for
[2:56:54] dignity
[2:56:56] just have dignity with your freedom
[2:57:01] boy i wish i wished i was where you are
[2:57:04] and somebody was preaching this to me
[2:57:08] i mean that
[2:57:10] i wish you and i were swapped places you
[2:57:13] were preaching this and i was out there
[2:57:16] showing you how to amend it
[2:57:20] you men of judea
[2:57:23] and you that dwell in jerusalem let this
[2:57:25] be known unto you and hearken to my
[2:57:28] words
[2:57:29] for these are not drunk
[2:57:33] you be careful what you say
[2:57:35] you stream a service and you see
[2:57:37] something that you don't understand or
[2:57:39] like you be careful what you say
[2:57:42] for these are not drunk as you suppose
[2:57:45] seeing it's the third hour of the day
[2:57:47] this is that which was spoken of by the
[2:57:51] prophet joel
[2:57:54] it shall come to pass in the
[2:57:58] last days
[2:58:01] saith god a
[2:58:03] out my spirit
[2:58:06] [Music]
[2:58:07] [Applause]
[2:58:14] [Music]
[2:58:19] [Applause]
[2:58:23] hallelujah
[2:58:25] hallelujah
[2:58:27] hallelujah
[2:58:29] [Applause]
[2:58:34] god
[2:58:35] [Music]
[2:58:38] i'll pour out my spirit
[2:58:43] on what
[2:58:46] [Applause]
[2:58:47] on what
[2:58:48] [Applause]
[2:58:50] oh
[2:58:52] inner man
[2:58:54] soul and spirit
[2:58:56] no
[2:58:57] all flesh
[2:59:00] god's not picking and choosing
[2:59:02] he's pouring his spirit out on all flesh
[2:59:05] you don't have anything to react to that
[2:59:07] with but the body he give you to react
[2:59:09] in and if god didn't want body praise
[2:59:12] his book of psalms could be plucked out
[2:59:14] of the word
[2:59:15] because the book of psalms talks about
[2:59:17] praise and every time it mentions praise
[2:59:19] it gives you a physical posture
[2:59:25] every time
[2:59:26] and i know we gravitate to the ones that
[2:59:28] make us the most comfortable or the ones
[2:59:30] we're most used to
[2:59:32] but there's nine davidic forms of praise
[2:59:35] and you need to broaden your horizon a
[2:59:37] little bit
[2:59:38] you need to expand your genre just a
[2:59:40] little bit and you need to learn there's
[2:59:42] more than one way
[2:59:44] to praise his name
[2:59:46] and to give him glory
[2:59:48] hallelujah
[2:59:51] now
[2:59:52] in closing
[2:59:55] closing two
[2:59:57] i am going to read two quotes
[3:00:00] because i want you to know
[3:00:03] that you cannot trust
[3:00:06] in a feeling
[3:00:08] or in a sensation or just in some kind
[3:00:11] of reaction
[3:00:13] to guide you
[3:00:16] there's only one thing to stand your
[3:00:18] life on
[3:00:19] and that's not a feeling
[3:00:21] because feelings come and feelings go
[3:00:25] i feel like praising him i don't feel
[3:00:26] like praising him i feel like praising
[3:00:28] him i don't feel like praising him
[3:00:31] you know my philosophy on that
[3:00:33] there's only two times to praise the
[3:00:34] lord anyhow when you feel like it when
[3:00:36] you don't feel like it
[3:00:39] and if you really want to help from god
[3:00:41] praise him when you don't feel like it
[3:00:43] praise him when you feel like napping
[3:00:46] praise him when you feel like quitting
[3:00:49] make a sacrifice of
[3:00:50] praise take your tongue off your off
[3:00:53] your sores
[3:00:55] quit licking your sores
[3:00:59] scrape them with a pot sheared so
[3:01:00] they'll bleed out all the corruption
[3:01:03] let god put some healing on your source
[3:01:06] you jump up from there and bless the
[3:01:07] name of the lord
[3:01:09] you jump up in there from there and say
[3:01:11] i've sat on this ash heap long enough
[3:01:16] i'm gonna get up here
[3:01:20] that i had a pen of iron
[3:01:24] sounds like praise to me
[3:01:25] that i could write these words i know
[3:01:29] i know
[3:01:31] i know my redeemer living
[3:01:35] amen
[3:01:39] it's better than a nerve pill
[3:01:43] praise will do you better than that
[3:01:45] but i want to read these two quotes
[3:01:47] because i know what people say
[3:01:50] i know how they talk
[3:01:55] i'm going to read them both and i want
[3:01:57] you to notice the dates
[3:01:59] i'm going to be fair about this because
[3:02:00] i think it's only right
[3:02:03] the first one is improving his word los
[3:02:06] angeles california
[3:02:10] we were putting together a
[3:02:13] collection of quotes sometime back
[3:02:17] and they asked me
[3:02:20] do we have to put where it was preached
[3:02:22] and i said no no i guess that don't
[3:02:24] really matter but the spirit of the lord
[3:02:26] kind of quickened my heart a little bit
[3:02:27] later
[3:02:29] and i don't ever take a quote
[3:02:32] off the off the table without
[3:02:34] typing in my notes where it was preached
[3:02:37] because i believe it matters
[3:02:39] i believe it matters
[3:02:41] i believe a prophet could tell a lot
[3:02:43] about the atmosphere of a city
[3:02:46] and i believe he presented things
[3:02:48] sometimes in a certain way because he
[3:02:51] understood the spirit
[3:02:53] that was over that region and over that
[3:02:55] area you watch carefully the things
[3:02:57] brother branham said over los angeles
[3:02:59] watch it carefully because every bit of
[3:03:02] it will come to pass
[3:03:03] before this thing's over
[3:03:06] you watch carefully the things that
[3:03:07] brother branham said in jeffersonville
[3:03:09] because the biggest the biggest uh
[3:03:12] multitude and gathering of demon spirits
[3:03:14] in any city in the nation for many years
[3:03:17] was jeffersonville indiana and the
[3:03:19] reason for that is because there were
[3:03:21] more demons being cast out of people in
[3:03:23] jeffersonville because he was there most
[3:03:26] often
[3:03:27] there were more demons being cast out in
[3:03:29] that city than any other city in the
[3:03:31] country so they like to gather there
[3:03:34] and you'll hear him say things
[3:03:37] you'll hear him say things about
[3:03:39] demonology
[3:03:40] that he said right there that he didn't
[3:03:42] say anywhere else in the message
[3:03:46] because there was a gathering of spirits
[3:03:48] there with a certain nature about them
[3:03:51] that he could recognize
[3:03:53] as one who saw into that other dimension
[3:03:55] so i noticed that this was preached in
[3:03:58] los angeles california
[3:04:00] he said and in the wilderness
[3:04:03] when many of them come out dancing in
[3:04:06] the spirit when miriam beat the
[3:04:08] tambourine eating manna out of heaven
[3:04:12] listen that moses sing in the spirit
[3:04:16] watching the miracles and signs go forth
[3:04:18] but here's the balance but when it come
[3:04:21] to a showdown to believe the whole word
[3:04:24] of god all the promise
[3:04:28] read it
[3:04:30] they failed
[3:04:32] you cannot afford i cannot afford to be
[3:04:35] that person
[3:04:40] what you've heard today just now i'm not
[3:04:42] bragging on myself i don't deserve it
[3:04:45] but what you've just heard so far today
[3:04:48] is a
[3:04:48] balance because i've preached to you the
[3:04:51] importance of praise the liberty of
[3:04:53] dance
[3:04:54] the way that we should express ourselves
[3:04:56] to the lord brother branham said in
[3:04:57] september september the 19th 1965 the
[3:05:01] joy bells the full experience the holy
[3:05:03] ghost speaking in tongues all of that
[3:05:05] 65.
[3:05:07] then i've come here now to tell you that
[3:05:10] when it came to a showdown those that
[3:05:11] danced in the spirit and those that
[3:05:13] prophesied and those that sung in the
[3:05:15] spirit everyone
[3:05:16] when it come time to make make a full
[3:05:19] decision for the whole
[3:05:22] whole word of god
[3:05:25] all the promise they failed you and i
[3:05:28] cannot afford to be those people
[3:05:30] somebody said what's brother i'm talking
[3:05:32] about first corinthians chapter 10
[3:05:35] they all ate the same spiritual meat
[3:05:37] they all drank the same spiritual drink
[3:05:39] verse 5 but with many of them god was
[3:05:40] not well pleased
[3:05:43] so you can never take your sensation
[3:05:45] your feeling your rejoi whatever you get
[3:05:47] whatever you have it's liberty liberty
[3:05:50] my god i'm not selling it i'm not giving
[3:05:52] it away
[3:05:54] i'm holding on to my freedom i'm holding
[3:05:56] on to my liberty i'm going to encourage
[3:05:58] you to have some but you're not getting
[3:05:59] mine
[3:06:03] there's nothing i don't know anything i
[3:06:05] haven't found anything in this message
[3:06:07] that told me i shouldn't shout i
[3:06:09] shouldn't praise the lord i shouldn't
[3:06:10] speak in tongues i hadn't found any of
[3:06:12] that
[3:06:13] he said when you get the completion of
[3:06:15] it they'll be speaking in tongues
[3:06:18] said it
[3:06:19] so so i haven't found it but i believe
[3:06:21] it's only right to bring the balance
[3:06:23] he bragged on miriam many many many
[3:06:25] times bragged on what they were doing up
[3:06:27] and down that river he he didn't say
[3:06:28] anything here critical about what they
[3:06:30] were doing then
[3:06:32] he just called our minds to the
[3:06:34] attention
[3:06:35] to
[3:06:36] to to remember
[3:06:38] that when this thing come down to a
[3:06:40] showdown and it's true nothing could be
[3:06:42] more true you can't meet the devil at
[3:06:44] the end of this thing
[3:06:46] the final test is not going to be
[3:06:47] whether you danced or whether you spoke
[3:06:49] in tongues or whether you had a shiver
[3:06:50] up your spine
[3:06:52] the final test is going to be the word
[3:06:54] test have you accepted the full word of
[3:06:56] god for your day
[3:06:58] and will you stand on that and not
[3:07:00] compromise
[3:07:04] amen it is a man
[3:07:06] i wanted to bring that i want to bring
[3:07:08] uh the next paragraph is short he said
[3:07:11] only two of them believed it
[3:07:13] out of all of israel
[3:07:16] only two of them believed it it was
[3:07:17] joshua and caleb why don't you be a
[3:07:19] joshua why don't you be a caleb why
[3:07:21] don't you make up your mind i'm going to
[3:07:23] be one of them that don't give up i'm
[3:07:25] not giving up my freedom to worship i'm
[3:07:27] not giving up my shout i'm not giving up
[3:07:29] my joy unspeakable and full of glory i'm
[3:07:31] not giving up my dance i'm not going to
[3:07:33] give up talking in tongues
[3:07:35] but i am going to make sure that when
[3:07:37] the word comes i'm going to be a joshua
[3:07:39] and the caleb
[3:07:55] i don't believe this church will ever be
[3:07:57] filled
[3:07:58] i don't believe that all of these
[3:08:00] promises and prophecies and things that
[3:08:02] were spoken will ever come to pass i
[3:08:04] believe it'll always be
[3:08:06] like it always was you believe what you
[3:08:08] want to believe
[3:08:13] but i might stand over your grave
[3:08:18] why would you say a thing like that
[3:08:19] because i'm telling you what happened in
[3:08:20] that story
[3:08:22] god dealt with every one of those
[3:08:23] naysayers
[3:08:25] who said the giants are there and we
[3:08:26] can't take it we'll never be able to
[3:08:28] make it come on
[3:08:30] you know the the one thing the jewish
[3:08:31] people they remember that every year
[3:08:33] they commemorate this whole season of of
[3:08:35] how those uh uh spies rejected and gave
[3:08:39] a bad report and and spread a negative
[3:08:41] report about what they saw
[3:08:43] i mean really they were being as honest
[3:08:45] as they could be at the moment
[3:08:47] but they were forgetting who's god they
[3:08:49] were who's god who who their god was and
[3:08:52] who they represented and they weren't
[3:08:54] there just to see it from the negative
[3:08:55] they were there to see it from all
[3:08:57] aspects
[3:08:59] and they came back and said we'll never
[3:09:01] they're they're bigger we're like
[3:09:02] grasshopper which was a terrible
[3:09:04] exaggeration
[3:09:05] but we're like little grasshoppers all
[3:09:07] they have to do just look at us we die
[3:09:10] but two come back and they said we are
[3:09:12] well you be the joshua somebody hear the
[3:09:15] word of the lord you'll be a caleb
[3:09:17] you'll be a joshua you'll be one of them
[3:09:20] that says we can
[3:09:23] if god said it
[3:09:26] that settles it
[3:09:29] he will perform his word
[3:09:33] he will take us through the turning of
[3:09:35] the corner
[3:09:37] he will fill up like he said he would
[3:09:40] and deliver like he said he would he's
[3:09:42] not a god that he should lie
[3:09:45] and they brought back the evidence
[3:09:47] [Music]
[3:09:50] one time i was was prophesied over me by
[3:09:53] by a pastor
[3:09:56] that had come out of pentecost into this
[3:09:58] message many years before i was born
[3:10:01] and
[3:10:02] he said thus saith the lord
[3:10:04] like a joshua and caleb
[3:10:07] you have gone across over into the
[3:10:09] promised land
[3:10:11] and you had no intention
[3:10:13] or desire to come back empty-handed
[3:10:16] and it is your burden and vision to
[3:10:19] bring something back
[3:10:20] to prove how good it is over there
[3:10:23] may god give me the grace to fulfill
[3:10:26] such a commission i want to do that with
[3:10:28] all my heart i want to tell you there's
[3:10:30] a good land over there and i can't tell
[3:10:32] you they're not wall cities because
[3:10:34] there are and i can't tell you they're
[3:10:36] not giants because they're there but i
[3:10:38] can tell you this if you'll sell out
[3:10:41] if you'll surrender everything you have
[3:10:43] to the lord we are well able to take the
[3:10:46] land
[3:10:47] if you believe that same man if we can
[3:10:50] only do that
[3:10:54] and the last one i didn't really get to
[3:10:55] preach on dancing come back
[3:10:58] i'm going to
[3:11:00] i'm going to
[3:11:01] that's what i struggled over last week
[3:11:03] when i told you that i had struggled all
[3:11:05] day because i was going to jump into the
[3:11:07] to the dancing part of this and i wasn't
[3:11:09] able to do it
[3:11:10] and until i until i heard the
[3:11:13] inspiration send judah first so we'll
[3:11:15] get to it
[3:11:16] but i want to read this and and i may
[3:11:18] read one more
[3:11:20] and then we'll go this is jesus keeps
[3:11:23] all his appointments
[3:11:24] paragraph 258 only and how many of you
[3:11:26] believe he does
[3:11:28] brother branham said don't make that
[3:11:29] mistake
[3:11:30] don't you trust in speaking in tongues
[3:11:33] for the holy ghost
[3:11:39] but listen
[3:11:41] some of you are reading ahead
[3:11:43] he said holy ghost speaks in tongues
[3:11:49] you'll find him saying that anybody that
[3:11:51] receives the baptism of the holy ghost
[3:11:53] at some time or another
[3:11:54] they will
[3:11:57] i believe that i believe he's right
[3:11:59] i believe he's right when he said it i
[3:12:01] don't believe it's the initial evidence
[3:12:03] and i don't believe that somebody has
[3:12:05] the holy ghost because they speak in
[3:12:06] tongues because demons can do that i've
[3:12:08] seen it
[3:12:09] demons can do that you anybody can mimic
[3:12:12] that
[3:12:13] but i believe when you receive the
[3:12:14] genuine baptism of the holy ghost it
[3:12:16] will produce the fruits of jesus christ
[3:12:18] in your life and at some time or another
[3:12:21] you'll you'll be blessed by the gift
[3:12:24] of being able to speak in tongues he
[3:12:26] said but don't you trust that
[3:12:32] to see a bikini on saturday and a dress
[3:12:34] on sunday
[3:12:35] and speaking in tongues he said don't
[3:12:37] trust that
[3:12:39] don't trust that
[3:12:41] drunk on saturday night and speaking in
[3:12:43] tongues in church on sunday morning
[3:12:45] don't trust that
[3:12:47] no no no no no
[3:12:48] but don't you trust that in doing the
[3:12:50] things that you're doing dancing in the
[3:12:52] spirit some kind of a sensation
[3:12:55] you see what brother branham was so
[3:12:57] against is people thinking that because
[3:12:59] they could do that
[3:13:01] they were right
[3:13:03] or because they could do that they had
[3:13:05] the holy ghost
[3:13:07] there's no substitution
[3:13:10] it the fact is it's the life able to
[3:13:12] live the word of god that's the evidence
[3:13:14] that the holy ghost is there but but
[3:13:16] because he said it this way so many
[3:13:18] people thought he was against these
[3:13:19] things that's why we can show you these
[3:13:21] other quotations to prove to you he
[3:13:23] wasn't against any of it he was against
[3:13:25] trusting it
[3:13:30] oh oh i got to get this i got to bring
[3:13:31] the balance brother read i have to
[3:13:36] i know there are people who believe that
[3:13:38] because they speak in tongues or because
[3:13:39] they prophesy or because they dance in
[3:13:41] the spirit or because they praise like a
[3:13:43] wild man
[3:13:44] that they have the holy ghost i want you
[3:13:47] to know that's not evidence of the holy
[3:13:49] ghost
[3:13:52] it's more than that you believe that
[3:13:55] now i want to be the balance hear me now
[3:13:57] well
[3:13:58] those people who go around and say i
[3:14:00] know i have the holy ghost because i
[3:14:02] believe brother branham is a prophet
[3:14:07] i couldn't believe brother branham was a
[3:14:09] prophet unless i had the holy ghost
[3:14:11] that's not right
[3:14:15] you're just as deceived as the one who
[3:14:17] thinks his jerking and sensation and
[3:14:20] moving around gives him the holy goal
[3:14:22] you're just as deceived you can believe
[3:14:24] that william branham is the greatest
[3:14:26] prophet that ever lived in the last
[3:14:28] church age messenger and all the things
[3:14:30] that you want to say about him
[3:14:32] and still not have the genuine baptism
[3:14:34] of the holy ghost
[3:14:35] somebody said i don't believe that's
[3:14:37] possible the bible said it is
[3:14:39] the bible said demons believe in tremble
[3:14:42] i want you to know if you could
[3:14:43] interview the devil today
[3:14:48] if you had an opportunity to ask the
[3:14:50] devil was william branham a prophet
[3:14:55] if you were to ask the devil okay some
[3:14:56] of you is getting a little touchy
[3:14:58] if you were to ask the devil was jack
[3:15:00] cole a mighty servant of god who had a
[3:15:02] gift of bulldog faith if you asked the
[3:15:04] devil that what do you think he'd say oh
[3:15:05] no he was a bluff oh no that's what the
[3:15:07] devil told jack cole
[3:15:09] but the devil would have to tell you the
[3:15:11] truth
[3:15:12] he'd probably tell he sure was yeah
[3:15:14] i tried everything i could do to stop
[3:15:16] him
[3:15:18] right all the things we know negative
[3:15:21] things you could say about oral roberts
[3:15:23] but if you were to ask the devil did he
[3:15:24] have a gift of faith
[3:15:27] did he serve a purpose was he sent from
[3:15:29] god the devil had to say the truth if
[3:15:31] you you know you might have pinned him
[3:15:32] down
[3:15:33] but the devil knows my point is the
[3:15:34] devil knows
[3:15:37] so if you could get the devil to be
[3:15:39] honest for a second
[3:15:41] you know it's like good luck with that
[3:15:43] but if you could pin him down he
[3:15:45] believes in trembles all the demons
[3:15:46] believe and tremble the devil knows he
[3:15:48] recognized
[3:15:50] he saw
[3:15:51] he didn't blind it anymore
[3:15:54] he wants there were a lot of things he
[3:15:55] didn't know
[3:15:57] he knows it he's got it
[3:15:59] he blinds our minds sometimes the god of
[3:16:02] this world blinds people's minds from
[3:16:04] seeing the reality right
[3:16:06] we have to pray about that being lifted
[3:16:08] and broken don't we but if the enemy if
[3:16:11] the devil was forced and could you give
[3:16:13] him a good shot of tooth serum or
[3:16:14] something and he had to tell the truth
[3:16:16] he would tell you without any hesitation
[3:16:18] that william branham was a prophet sent
[3:16:20] from god
[3:16:23] because he believes it
[3:16:25] he saw it
[3:16:27] he was an eyewitness
[3:16:29] now if what people say about i have the
[3:16:32] holy ghost because i believe brother
[3:16:33] branham i know i have the holy ghost
[3:16:35] because i believe brother bran was a
[3:16:37] prophet
[3:16:38] then the devil has the holy ghost
[3:16:41] if the sa if that reasoning could carry
[3:16:43] all the way over then you could say the
[3:16:45] enemy has a holy ghost now we will tell
[3:16:47] you what the prophet said if you never
[3:16:48] heard him
[3:16:49] he said if the devil
[3:16:52] were baptized in the name of the lord
[3:16:54] jesus christ
[3:16:56] he'd be born again
[3:16:59] repent of his sin and straighten out his
[3:17:01] life he'd be born again he said did no
[3:17:03] longer be the devil
[3:17:05] he'd be your brother
[3:17:07] somebody said i don't believe that's
[3:17:09] going to happen neither do i
[3:17:11] but you know what he's talking about
[3:17:13] what he was talking about the power of
[3:17:14] the blood
[3:17:16] the power of obeying the word
[3:17:18] it works
[3:17:20] somebody said works
[3:17:21] [Applause]

[3:20:01] paragraph 146 about 15 years ago tonight
[3:20:06] i was standing on this platform here
[3:20:08] with a big chart
[3:20:10] teaching
[3:20:11] my
[3:20:12] it's interesting
[3:20:14] there was a little pentecostal group
[3:20:16] come from louisville
[3:20:18] and i never did believe in them people
[3:20:19] dancing the way they did
[3:20:22] you see brother branham was a
[3:20:24] independent baptist
[3:20:31] not pentecostal originally
[3:20:35] he wanted to preserve the dignity
[3:20:38] i'm just i'm not putting words in his
[3:20:40] mouth
[3:20:41] there's three quotes here and i'll only
[3:20:43] read one but i will share the others and
[3:20:45] there was a little lady come up here to
[3:20:46] play the piano and they was going to
[3:20:48] play a special and beat on a little
[3:20:50] thimbles thimbles on a washboard
[3:20:53] you know what a thimble is a little
[3:20:55] protector over your fingertip to keep
[3:20:57] your needle from piercing your finger
[3:20:58] you know what a washboard is
[3:21:02] half of us have never held a washboard
[3:21:08] they put thimbles on their fingers and
[3:21:10] bring that washboard to church and
[3:21:12] stroke it like this
[3:21:23] not very baptist
[3:21:26] not very dignified they're more
[3:21:27] pentecostals from louisville
[3:21:30] wrong side of the river
[3:21:31] they come over here to jeffersonville
[3:21:33] messing everything up
[3:21:35] there come a little lady up there to
[3:21:36] play the piano they was going to play a
[3:21:38] special thimble's on a wash board
[3:21:44] and some of them beat on a tin can
[3:21:47] i don't know how that sounds i don't
[3:21:48] know how to do that
[3:21:50] i was very much listen
[3:21:52] no no no no no i was very much a critic
[3:21:55] of that of it
[3:21:57] so i thought what's going to happen
[3:22:00] and the woman came up to play the
[3:22:02] special she got to
[3:22:04] playing the lady got to beating on the
[3:22:07] washboard
[3:22:12] this little blonde headed girl jumped
[3:22:14] out of here on the floor
[3:22:19] and began to dance
[3:22:23] in the spirit
[3:22:24] [Applause]
[3:22:27] and me
[3:22:30] what did the word say
[3:22:33] do not sit in the seat of the scornful
[3:22:36] but brother branham was a human being a
[3:22:38] man
[3:22:39] just a man chosen by god he had the same
[3:22:42] reactions that we have sometimes
[3:22:46] people screaming in here waving flags
[3:22:48] and hollering and telling people who can
[3:22:50] pray and who can't all the things we do
[3:22:52] sometimes
[3:22:55] and he said me sitting in the seat of
[3:22:56] the scornful he said now i said now i
[3:22:59] wish you would look at that
[3:23:02] and i had been telling my church till
[3:23:05] they was all wondering what i was going
[3:23:07] to do about it
[3:23:12] just showing you want you to get it
[3:23:13] here's brother branham sitting he's
[3:23:15] thinking this is my now i'm i'm telling
[3:23:17] you something but it's not in this quote
[3:23:19] it's in another quote i'll read them all
[3:23:20] for it's over but he in one of the
[3:23:22] quotes he said this is my tabernacle
[3:23:27] he said this is my tabernacle i'm not
[3:23:28] going for such as that in here
[3:23:31] so he's sitting over there in the seat
[3:23:32] of the scornful and here's a blonde
[3:23:35] headed girl she's done gone to dancing
[3:23:38] and granny
[3:23:42] and somebody's beating on a tin can
[3:23:47] no funeral home music playing
[3:23:50] cause you cannot play the the washboard
[3:23:52] to funeral home music
[3:23:55] it was probably something like everybody
[3:23:57] will be happy over there
[3:24:00] come on
[3:24:01] and he said now i wish you'd look at
[3:24:04] that
[3:24:05] and everybody in the church looking at
[3:24:07] brother branham waiting on him
[3:24:10] because he'd been preaching on the
[3:24:11] spirit it gives the spirit and things of
[3:24:13] the spirit he said you know we're just
[3:24:15] seeking the lord to see how to handle
[3:24:16] that here
[3:24:18] he was looking for answers
[3:24:20] because you know when you get mixed up
[3:24:22] you're a baptist preacher you get mixed
[3:24:24] up with pentecost
[3:24:26] you've got to decide how much of that
[3:24:27] you're going to let go on in your
[3:24:29] meetings he said it i'm telling you what
[3:24:32] he said
[3:24:34] i just went through i just went through
[3:24:36] every quote i could find of brother
[3:24:38] branham in a preaching on the gifts of
[3:24:40] the spirit meant talking about the gifts
[3:24:41] of the spirit he was struggling
[3:24:44] to find the proper balance
[3:24:47] because he had a problem there in
[3:24:49] jeffersonville
[3:24:50] like no other
[3:24:54] he had to deal with some stuff
[3:24:56] because the people were constantly
[3:24:58] interrupting the preaching
[3:25:00] with
[3:25:01] supposed gifts
[3:25:04] he said in me sitting in the seat of the
[3:25:06] scorpio i said now i wish you would look
[3:25:08] at that and i've been what about you
[3:25:10] musicians making your way this way would
[3:25:12] you
[3:25:13] and i have been telling my church till
[3:25:16] they was all wondered what i was going
[3:25:17] to do about it
[3:25:19] i'm sure they were already imagining
[3:25:20] brother branham coming to the pulpit and
[3:25:23] saying now listen here
[3:25:26] we don't have such tummy rot in here
[3:25:29] we don't have such carrying on in here
[3:25:31] they're expecting that
[3:25:34] he was trying to formulate how he was
[3:25:36] going to handle it
[3:25:38] he said i kept looking at her and i
[3:25:39] thought look at that
[3:25:41] now if that isn't something listen to
[3:25:43] what he said
[3:25:45] making a tavern
[3:25:47] out of my church
[3:25:50] now let me just clarify this and help
[3:25:52] you to understand something here had
[3:25:54] brother branham been raised in a
[3:25:56] pentecostal church dancing in a service
[3:26:00] would have been very common for him but
[3:26:04] he wasn't
[3:26:06] his upbringing was independent baptist
[3:26:09] so for him his only concept of dancing
[3:26:13] was the ger like the girl
[3:26:17] that brother branham talks about often
[3:26:20] who who got healed and what did she do
[3:26:22] she wanted to go back to the taverns and
[3:26:24] dance with her dance partner and win the
[3:26:26] contest
[3:26:28] so his concept of dancing was what goes
[3:26:31] on in the in the juke joint or the honky
[3:26:34] tonk but had he been raised in the
[3:26:36] pentecostal church he wouldn't have had
[3:26:38] quite the same reaction
[3:26:41] because he would have been used to that
[3:26:43] happening at least
[3:26:44] occasionally but he was not reacting
[3:26:47] well this is his confession no one is
[3:26:51] criticizing him we're just reading what
[3:26:53] he said
[3:26:55] he said making a tavern out of my church
[3:26:58] and i was sitting there what
[3:27:01] not knowing any better
[3:27:05] i wasn't saying nothing but in my heart
[3:27:07] nothing out loud but in my heart i was
[3:27:10] thinking it you still with me
[3:27:13] so i watched her there while she was
[3:27:15] dancing
[3:27:18] just whatever she was doing
[3:27:20] he remembered she had blonde hair
[3:27:23] he said the first thing you know i said
[3:27:25] now wait a minute
[3:27:30] let's look at this by the word
[3:27:33] we can't look at this by the church we
[3:27:34] were raised in
[3:27:36] that's not a proper measuring stick
[3:27:39] we've got to look at this by
[3:27:42] the word
[3:27:44] not always fun but it's always right
[3:27:47] he said i wonder if that lady's got any
[3:27:49] scripture for that and i begin to think
[3:27:51] about the scriptures
[3:27:53] i said
[3:27:59] where was dancing ever ordained at
[3:28:04] the first place in the bible
[3:28:08] that's right and i thought what made
[3:28:12] them
[3:28:13] dance
[3:28:14] sometimes he kind of said dance
[3:28:19] i seen the children of israel
[3:28:22] [Music]
[3:28:25] when they cross the red sea maryam look
[3:28:28] back oh my god help me
[3:28:31] miriam look back and seen all those task
[3:28:34] masters
[3:28:36] drowned i wonder if they recognized one
[3:28:40] that had beat them on the back
[3:28:46] harassed them mocked them shamed them
[3:28:49] drove them beat them
[3:28:54] locked them up
[3:28:56] and now they're floating in the water
[3:29:01] when she looked and saw all those seen
[3:29:03] all them taskmasters drowned she picked
[3:29:06] up a tambourine
[3:29:10] see she had not been raised in the
[3:29:12] independent baptist church
[3:29:16] dance was a regular expression of praise
[3:29:19] to god for the hebrew people
[3:29:22] they danced in egypt
[3:29:25] they worshipped somebody said how do you
[3:29:27] know that you wasn't there i'll tell you
[3:29:29] how i know it because i know how they
[3:29:32] celebrated the feast in the
[3:29:34] concentration camps of auschwitz and
[3:29:37] birknow and all the rest
[3:29:40] i know
[3:29:41] that if they kept the feast and
[3:29:43] celebrated the festivals of the lord
[3:29:46] under hitler's threat
[3:29:49] in concentration camps i guarantee you
[3:29:52] they celebrated the goodness of god over
[3:29:54] there in egypt before he revealed all
[3:29:56] those things to him what they were
[3:29:58] supposed to do i guarantee you they had
[3:30:01] some times
[3:30:02] she picked up a tambourine and began to
[3:30:04] dance
[3:30:05] and beat this tambourine and run down
[3:30:08] the shores dancing
[3:30:11] not by herself
[3:30:12] i i just i'll just be honest with you i
[3:30:15] hate to see anybody
[3:30:16] praising the lord by themselves
[3:30:19] something in me wants to help them
[3:30:22] i know they're not doing it for me but
[3:30:24] when i see somebody alone trying to
[3:30:26] press in it just makes me want to jump
[3:30:28] up and press in with them
[3:30:30] for them because of them
[3:30:33] and beat the timber of this tamarind run
[3:30:35] down the shores dancing and the
[3:30:36] daughters of israel followed her dancing
[3:30:39] i thought
[3:30:41] reread it
[3:30:45] just a minute just a minute
[3:30:49] making my church a tavern
[3:30:53] i'm not going to have that in here
[3:30:56] a few seconds later that's
[3:31:00] victory
[3:31:01] the holy ghost will override your
[3:31:03] opinion if you'll let him
[3:31:07] you take it back to the word
[3:31:10] and if it doesn't meet the word if it
[3:31:12] doesn't match the word you're wrong
[3:31:16] he said i thought that's victory whoa
[3:31:18] that's victory
[3:31:20] he said when david slew in that the next
[3:31:23] one no sorry wrong wrong quote he said
[3:31:26] if you don't like that
[3:31:28] oh sorry 151 i seen david
[3:31:34] he's just taken a stroll
[3:31:36] they're dancing he's thinking
[3:31:38] holy spirit's just taken him at least
[3:31:41] you're not in the seat of the scornful
[3:31:42] anymore
[3:31:43] he's letting god reveal the word to him
[3:31:44] indeed
[3:31:45] i'm tired
[3:31:47] he said i seen david
[3:31:50] when his sweetheart sitting up there
[3:31:52] behind this van a fanning
[3:31:55] looking at her cute little boyfriend
[3:31:57] david standing out there and here comes
[3:32:00] the ark that brother graham talked about
[3:32:02] a while ago coming across the hill
[3:32:05] that would probably be graham snelling
[3:32:07] wouldn't it maybe because he was at the
[3:32:09] where he was at the tabernacle
[3:32:12] he said coming across the hill when
[3:32:14] david seen it coming
[3:32:16] he danced
[3:32:20] you looked at me funny the other day
[3:32:25] brother venom said he danced around and
[3:32:27] around and around
[3:32:30] [Music]
[3:32:31] come on
[3:32:33] hallelujah why she said why why why she
[3:32:38] said you embarrass me
[3:32:41] let's read on
[3:32:43] he said if you don't like that
[3:32:48] he just quote he just gives us the
[3:32:49] scripture i'm done nearly
[3:32:51] if you don't like that watch this
[3:32:57] and around and around and around he went
[3:32:59] again
[3:33:02] he said you know what god god god looked
[3:33:05] down out of heaven and said david you're
[3:33:08] a man
[3:33:10] [Music]
[3:33:10] [Applause]
[3:33:13] you want to know what god thinks about a
[3:33:14] man dancing
[3:33:19] somebody said well the holy ghost come
[3:33:21] and jerked him up and made him dance
[3:33:22] that is not what the scripture said when
[3:33:24] he saw the ark
[3:33:26] when he saw the ark
[3:33:29] when he saw the ark coming up the road
[3:33:32] coming home coming home coming back home
[3:33:35] he jumped up and began to dance before
[3:33:37] the lord hallelujah hallelujah
[3:33:39] hallelujah david
[3:33:42] you're a man after my own heart
[3:33:45] you ever want to know what god thinks
[3:33:46] about a man you a michael christian
[3:33:52] you want to know what god thinks about
[3:33:53] you
[3:33:59] david you're a man michael you're a man
[3:34:00] after my own heart
[3:34:03] because you do it whether you feel it or
[3:34:05] not
[3:34:06] you do it whether you're good at it or
[3:34:07] not and i'm not saying you're not good
[3:34:09] at you've got a lot of practice
[3:34:12] service after service after service
[3:34:14] after service after service after
[3:34:16] service sister jeffrey when he first
[3:34:18] started he stumbled over his own feet
[3:34:21] but he did it and if anybody knows him
[3:34:23] they know
[3:34:25] that that awkwardness that he carries
[3:34:27] sometime
[3:34:29] it took everything he could muster
[3:34:35] but he overcame it
[3:34:42] that's right that's right
[3:34:45] that's right
[3:34:47] that's right
[3:34:48] [Applause]
[3:34:51] was that dancing in the spirit it was
[3:34:53] dancing before the spirit
[3:34:56] it was dancing before the lord
[3:35:00] i'm sure there were times he felt the
[3:35:01] spirit of god fall on him but it wasn't
[3:35:04] all about a feeling
[3:35:06] it was about doing what i can
[3:35:09] to bring myself
[3:35:12] under submission and subjection to the
[3:35:15] great holy ghost
[3:35:16] because i want him to talk to me and i
[3:35:18] want him to help me and i want him to
[3:35:20] lead me and i want him to guide me
[3:35:23] anybody still here
[3:35:24] [Applause]
[3:35:27] um we're nearly done
[3:35:30] and i thought
[3:35:32] you know
[3:35:33] there's one thing that's the matter with
[3:35:35] me
[3:35:36] i
[3:35:44] i'm just not a dancer
[3:35:46] i just can't get up there with people
[3:35:47] watching me i just can't do it unless i
[3:35:49] feel it
[3:35:53] church ain't for that
[3:35:55] this is not this is not the place for
[3:35:56] that kind of moving around and dancing
[3:35:58] and carrying on and
[3:36:03] brother branham recognized his problem
[3:36:06] you won't like it
[3:36:08] you won't like it that he said it
[3:36:10] preachers won't quote it
[3:36:15] but here's what he said
[3:36:17] you know there's one thing that matter
[3:36:18] of me i haven't got enough victory maybe
[3:36:23] and i got sitting there and i got my
[3:36:25] methodist foot padding what his method
[3:36:27] is now
[3:36:31] that was i tell you that was a step in
[3:36:33] the right direction
[3:36:36] he left the starch of the baptist and he
[3:36:37] got the pet in his foot like a methodist
[3:36:39] come on now there's a way being made
[3:36:42] there's a way being made
[3:36:44] there's a way being made and the first
[3:36:46] thing you know god might judge
[3:36:48] listen this is not a man being silly
[3:36:51] this is a man being very serious he now
[3:36:54] says god by judge
[3:36:58] for i knowed what i was doing
[3:37:02] he went all the way
[3:37:05] baptist methodist
[3:37:08] one of them old pentecostals from
[3:37:10] louisville
[3:37:11] across the river
[3:37:14] next thing you know he said hallelujah
[3:37:16] hallelujah hallelujah
[3:37:19] praise god
[3:37:21] for i note for i knowed for i knowed
[3:37:24] before i knew what i was doing
[3:37:28] because there are times that god says
[3:37:31] i've just got to take you a little bit
[3:37:33] out of your head
[3:37:36] got to bring you just a little bit
[3:37:37] further than your head and let you get
[3:37:39] caught up before you know you're caught
[3:37:41] up
[3:37:42] that's what happened he got caught up
[3:37:44] before he realized he was caught up he
[3:37:47] said before i know what i was doing i
[3:37:49] was out on the floor here dancing around
[3:37:59] i don't think he meant like this with
[3:38:01] her do you
[3:38:04] but on the floor
[3:38:06] with that girl at the same time he was
[3:38:08] dancing and praising god god brought him
[3:38:11] out all the way out of the seat of the
[3:38:13] scornful and gave him liberty to worship
[3:38:16] god hallelujah you can't even say
[3:38:18] according to the dictates of his heart
[3:38:20] because it wasn't originally in his
[3:38:21] heart to worship god that way but he
[3:38:23] said there could be only be one thing
[3:38:24] wrong with me i don't have enough
[3:38:25] victory
[3:38:28] so there could only be one thing wrong
[3:38:30] with the church
[3:38:32] that has put all that out
[3:38:34] and decided we don't need liberty
[3:38:36] anymore
[3:38:38] you don't have enough victory but i tell
[3:38:40] you in the name of the lord there's
[3:38:41] victory to be had
[3:38:43] because jesus is the victor jesus is the
[3:38:46] victor
[3:38:47] jesus is the victor two more paragraphs
[3:38:50] same quote
[3:38:51] he said then i said go god
[3:38:55] he's already out on the floor or down
[3:38:57] the floor
[3:38:58] let's stand you need to stretch you've
[3:39:00] been sitting so long
[3:39:02] you need to stand i need to sit
[3:39:06] you need a stretch i need to draw up
[3:39:08] he said then i said god take me out of
[3:39:12] the seat of the scornful
[3:39:15] let me look at anything sensibly
[3:39:21] [Music]
[3:39:23] before i ever pass a judgment anymore
[3:39:27] amen i'm not going to read the next
[3:39:30] sentence
[3:39:32] it might be a bit self-serving
[3:39:35] i'll let you read it
[3:39:39] one more time god does things
[3:39:47] and we better be glad
[3:39:50] because some of us are peculiar
[3:39:54] he said i don't believe in a lot here's
[3:39:55] the balance
[3:39:57] i could cut that off
[3:39:59] but i'm not
[3:40:00] he said i don't believe in a lot of
[3:40:02] nonsense i don't believe in a lot of
[3:40:03] tommy rot but i believe in the real
[3:40:06] genuine spirit-filled holy ghost word of
[3:40:09] god being preached in power and
[3:40:12] demonstration amen
[3:40:15] he said for that's the thing that saved
[3:40:17] me
[3:40:18] that's the thing that brought me thus
[3:40:20] far that's the thing that helped me when
[3:40:22] the doctor said i was dying that's the
[3:40:24] thing that saved me in the hour of my
[3:40:25] death that's the thing that'll resurrect
[3:40:28] me
[3:40:30] we're reading on and that's the thing
[3:40:32] i'll go to heaven with if i ever get
[3:40:34] there i'll have to go buy it because i
[3:40:36] don't know nothing else but that and
[3:40:38] don't want to know nothing else but that
[3:40:41] that's right
[3:40:43] so there's no disclaimer there
[3:40:45] brother branham didn't understand it
[3:40:47] either
[3:40:48] until god taught him
[3:40:50] showed him right there where is it found
[3:40:52] right there in the word
[3:40:56] we're going to stop here
[3:40:58] but i will bring i'll come back because
[3:41:00] i'm not nearly done with the subject
[3:41:02] i never thought
[3:41:04] there be a day that you'd just take a
[3:41:06] whole text on on uh dancing but the
[3:41:09] day's here
[3:41:11] the day's here now two years ago or last
[3:41:13] year sometime i preached on dance or die
[3:41:16] and there is a time where you feel like
[3:41:18] if i don't get out of my
[3:41:21] rut
[3:41:22] if i don't get out of my rut brother
[3:41:25] branham said it runs a grave with the
[3:41:26] ends kicked out of it if i don't get out
[3:41:29] of my rut i'm going to lay here and die
[3:41:32] there there comes a time where you've
[3:41:34] got to be like those four little lepers
[3:41:36] men and say i cannot sit here and die
[3:41:40] without trying to save myself
[3:41:44] [Music]
[3:41:46] i can't
[3:41:48] i've got to break forward
[3:41:52] send judah first
[3:41:54] praise
[3:41:56] has to go before us
[3:41:58] now what do you want to do do you want
[3:41:59] to say i think we've probably sung
[3:42:01] enough of uh uh of speak the name of
[3:42:03] jesus so you've got something else
[3:42:08] isn't this a nifty stand i've found in
[3:42:10] vault benjamin
