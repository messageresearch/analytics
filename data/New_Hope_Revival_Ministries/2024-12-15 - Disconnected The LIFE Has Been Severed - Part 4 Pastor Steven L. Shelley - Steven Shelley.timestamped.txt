[54:58] faithful streaming and the family there
[55:00] and we just sent her lots of love this
[55:02] week and then he's out so we don't we
[55:05] can say whatever we want to about
[55:07] brother gley getting
[55:09] old cause he's not in
[55:12] it his slightly older wife said tell
[55:17] it and my wife is not in here either or
[55:20] she'd have said tell it
[55:22] too because this as a Friday brother gy
[55:26] turns
[55:28] 55 that's double
[55:30] Grace it's just a
[55:32] number it is you do notice it I'm not
[55:36] going to pretend like you don't notice
[55:37] it in the morning I'm 56 I ought to know
[55:41] but but it's just a number and there are
[55:43] a few months out of the year that
[55:45] brother gley is older than my wife and
[55:47] that starts Friday and she loves that
[55:50] time it's her favorite time of year and
[55:53] they they poke on one another like
[55:55] brother and sister but uh I I always
[55:59] tell this we were at Youth Camp in in uh
[56:03] in West Milton Ohio so many years ago
[56:05] and brother gley had I actually met
[56:09] brother gy before he married sister
[56:12] Joyce and Nathan had been born Nathan's
[56:16] not feeling well today he's streaming
[56:18] Nathan had been born and he was a wee
[56:20] little one it seemed seemed like in
[56:23] brother G's big old hand
[56:26] say it again
[56:28] sister he had was seven weeks old well
[56:30] he was little then and brother greedy
[56:33] was at that Youth Camp I was speaking
[56:35] and uh he had he had Nathan and he was
[56:39] kind of holding holding him in a little
[56:41] football hold you know like that and
[56:44] brother gy looked about
[56:49] 12 and there was some sisters some busy
[56:53] busy sisters I'll just say busy sisters
[56:55] all right I'll leave out some of it who
[56:57] got really worried about the way that
[56:59] that little boy was holding his little
[57:04] brother so they come down to where I was
[57:06] sitting they said brother shelle would
[57:08] you please say something to that boy for
[57:10] the way he's holding his little brother
[57:13] I said well sure sisters I'll be glad to
[57:15] go say something to him but the reality
[57:17] is that's not his little brother that's
[57:19] his son and I guess he can hold him any
[57:22] way he wants to and they said well that
[57:25] boy didn't look like he would be big
[57:26] enough to be married much old enough to
[57:29] be married much less have a have a baby
[57:33] boy well he's looking a little closer to
[57:36] his age these days I feel lots of
[57:38] Liberty with him not in
[57:41] here but I will tell you that he is a
[57:44] man of the highest
[57:47] Integrity I know he got the character
[57:49] from Jesus but he had a great example in
[57:52] his dad his dad Pastor a church in his
[57:56] 80s how old is pop grandp somebody tell
[58:01] 80 you remember 82 or
[58:05] 83 and we saw a clip on social media of
[58:09] him climbing down knee replacement now
[58:12] went through a terrible time climbing
[58:14] down in the baptistry to baptize
[58:16] somebody just a couple Sundays ago still
[58:18] pastoring still going on still preaching
[58:21] the end time message and brother gley
[58:24] has been a great great man of character
[58:26] and strength to this church for a long
[58:28] long time and he's I think he's going to
[58:30] be out of town on his birthday uh but do
[58:34] what you can to show him love you can
[58:36] you can press some money in his hand and
[58:38] tell him to buy himself a meal or
[58:40] whatever you feel to do but he is uh
[58:43] he's the real
[58:44] deal and I I hope that we're both alive
[58:47] at Rapture and I hope I'm on his Cloud I
[58:49] hope I'm right next to him because he
[58:52] has certainly stood stood very close to
[58:54] me through all of these years most
[58:56] faithful friend that I've ever had and
[58:58] I'm thankful for him today not just on
[59:00] his birthday but
[59:02] always well let's hear the word let's
[59:05] get there would you stand again you've
[59:07] been up and down but would you get up
[59:09] again and turn with me again if you will
[59:11] to John chapter
[59:13] 15 I want to say with brother gley how
[59:16] nice it is to have sister Laurel's
[59:18] family I it's been a long time since
[59:21] I've seen her brother Lance and his wife
[59:24] sister Judy and I have to say that as
[59:27] the years have come you you I don't
[59:29] remember you looking quite as much like
[59:31] Mark as you do now but you really really
[59:35] looking back it really maybe your wife
[59:38] would say you're the you're the better
[59:39] looking version of Mark I I don't know I
[59:42] it wouldn't be appropriate for me to say
[59:44] but it certainly brings back lots of
[59:46] good memories seeing you all here today
[59:48] John 15 and verse one Jesus all read
[59:52] letters I am the True Vine and my my
[59:56] father is the
[59:58] husbandman every branch in me that
[1:00:01] beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may
[1:00:06] bring forth more fruit now ye are clean
[1:00:11] through the word which I have spoken
[1:00:14] unto you verse four abide in
[1:00:19] me and I in
[1:00:22] you now if Jesus is telling us us his
[1:00:27] disciples
[1:00:28] then his bride now that we should abide
[1:00:33] in him and he in
[1:00:37] us then we must have something to
[1:00:41] do with allowing him to abide in us
[1:00:46] because he said abide in me and I in you
[1:00:50] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[1:00:53] itself except it abide abide in the
[1:00:57] vine no more can ye except ye read it
[1:01:02] abide in me I am the vine ye are the
[1:01:06] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[1:01:09] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:01:12] thank God for without me this is so so
[1:01:16] incredibly true it's true today it'll be
[1:01:19] true
[1:01:20] tomorrow for without me ye you can do
[1:01:26] do you know we might would say little
[1:01:29] not much Jesus just cut to the Chase and
[1:01:33] he said you need to know you can't do
[1:01:35] anything without me and I believe him if
[1:01:38] a man abide not in me and he has cast
[1:01:41] forth as a branch and is withered and
[1:01:43] Men gather them and cast them into the
[1:01:46] fire and they are burned and then John
[1:01:51] 157 which we heard brother brandham
[1:01:53] quoting so many many times if ye abide
[1:01:58] in me and my words abide in
[1:02:03] you you shall ask what ye will blank
[1:02:08] check and it shall be done there is a
[1:02:12] blank check there he said but there's a
[1:02:15] prerequisite on the blank check and that
[1:02:18] is if you abide in me and you allow my
[1:02:23] words to abide in you then you shall ask
[1:02:28] and what what whatsoever you ask it
[1:02:30] shall be done if you believe that say
[1:02:33] Amen father we come before you today
[1:02:36] with a grateful heart you have been so
[1:02:40] good so faithful to your children you
[1:02:45] are still Jehovah Rafa the Healer and
[1:02:49] you said I heal all of your diseases and
[1:02:53] infirmities and we stand on that today
[1:02:57] we stand on that with our eyes on you we
[1:03:00] stand on that Lord I pray again for
[1:03:04] those streaming this service today in
[1:03:07] the nations of the world who could not
[1:03:09] be here and even some local ones who are
[1:03:12] streaming who are sick in body or else
[1:03:15] have just come through something and and
[1:03:17] they wanted to do do us a favor and and
[1:03:21] uh try to slow down the spread of
[1:03:24] anything but we ask that you touch them
[1:03:27] today the same Jesus that walks Among Us
[1:03:30] in this hour in this house Lord you can
[1:03:33] walk into their home you can move for
[1:03:36] them you can raise them up and we're not
[1:03:39] just concerned about symptoms but go to
[1:03:41] the root of whatever these infirmities
[1:03:44] are and bring healing we pray Lord let
[1:03:48] your word come forth today with Clarity
[1:03:50] and let it accomplish all that it is
[1:03:53] sent forth to do and we will give you
[1:03:55] glory and honor and praise for it's in
[1:03:57] the name above every name the name of
[1:04:00] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the
[1:04:03] saint said you may be seated we're
[1:04:07] continuing this morning a little series
[1:04:10] on
[1:04:11] disconnection the life has been
[1:04:15] severed this is the most connected hour
[1:04:19] that we have ever known as sojourners
[1:04:23] here on planet Earth amen the there's
[1:04:25] never been another time like this hour
[1:04:29] where people are so connected I am
[1:04:32] standing here this morning and I
[1:04:34] remember that that chilly apartment up
[1:04:37] in the church in Columbus so many years
[1:04:40] ago uh there was a blank screen sister
[1:04:43] Alfreda on the computer we didn't have
[1:04:46] we didn't have all the back lit fancy
[1:04:49] fancy screens that we have today it was
[1:04:52] just a blank screen black screen and one
[1:04:55] little
[1:04:56] blipping dot just
[1:04:59] beeping and I'll never forget it Kevin
[1:05:03] McGregor's on the other end of the line
[1:05:05] and he's this this was this was pre
[1:05:08] iMessage days this was there were no
[1:05:11] iPhones I hadn't even got my bag phone
[1:05:14] yet this was this was antique times the
[1:05:17] kids call it you know and and I'll never
[1:05:20] forget what it felt like when he types a
[1:05:22] message and that little bleeping dot
[1:05:24] begin to form letters and go across the
[1:05:27] screen he said hello brother Shelly from
[1:05:30] Frozen
[1:05:31] Edmonton I jumped up and down like a
[1:05:34] silly little child because there had
[1:05:36] been no iMessage there was no texting
[1:05:38] then email was just
[1:05:41] beginning and I thought wow we are
[1:05:46] connected if I want to say I mean I
[1:05:48] didn't know what to say back all of a
[1:05:50] sudden I was speechless I didn't even
[1:05:52] know what to type and I I I think I
[1:05:55] think we answered back well well hello
[1:05:57] brother from from the baly south or
[1:06:00] something like that and little did we
[1:06:02] know that just 25 30 plus 35 or too many
[1:06:07] years ago and now we're in a time where
[1:06:10] we can speak to someone anywhere in the
[1:06:13] world there's never been a more
[1:06:14] connected hour than the one we're we're
[1:06:16] in now the list of social media Outlets
[1:06:20] is getting longer every day and people
[1:06:22] are getting sucked in to the rabbit hole
[1:06:25] of being being connected and yet we have
[1:06:28] people who say I I'm feeling so
[1:06:32] disconnected
[1:06:33] spiritually I I I'm just feeling numb
[1:06:37] even this week I had a dear friend of
[1:06:39] mine sitting across the table who said
[1:06:42] to me brother I love this message I love
[1:06:45] this word I love this truth but but I'm
[1:06:48] I'm feeling cold I'm just not I'm just
[1:06:52] not feeling alive I'm not feeling a fire
[1:06:55] a passion that I have felt and it's it's
[1:06:58] not just his reality but it's the
[1:07:01] reality of so many people that we hear
[1:07:03] from around the world I just feel
[1:07:06] disconnected from him well I want you to
[1:07:08] understand he never hangs up the
[1:07:10] call he never ghosts us when we need him
[1:07:15] he he never refuses he's not even like
[1:07:18] some of you who never
[1:07:22] bother to answer a text
[1:07:26] you're you're so spiritual that you
[1:07:27] can't even send a thumbs
[1:07:30] up you know uh but he he won't ever
[1:07:34] ghost you that way he'll never he'll
[1:07:36] never let you communicate one-sided
[1:07:39] he'll always let you know that I'm on
[1:07:42] the other end of The Kite string even
[1:07:44] when you can't see me even when you
[1:07:46] can't feel me even when it's only every
[1:07:49] now and again that you feel the tug on
[1:07:51] the other end of the line but you'll
[1:07:52] know he's there because his word said so
[1:07:57] and we can count on what his word has
[1:07:59] said if you believe that amen so if
[1:08:02] we're feeling disconnected and sometimes
[1:08:05] we do this is not to to condemn you or
[1:08:08] to judge you or even to blame you but
[1:08:12] who else are we going to blame if we
[1:08:14] can't blame him because he said I'll
[1:08:17] always be with you I'll go with you even
[1:08:19] to the end of the world we know he'll
[1:08:21] never leave us he'll never forsake us
[1:08:24] then if we're dis connected who hung
[1:08:27] up who ghosted who who forgot to stay
[1:08:32] connected to the
[1:08:34] vine he said if you abide in me and my
[1:08:37] words abide in you and and that means
[1:08:42] there there that if is there it's that
[1:08:44] small little word that says you've got
[1:08:46] to do this there is a prerequisite there
[1:08:49] is a requirement in this hour and even
[1:08:52] though the book is opened and even
[1:08:53] though the revelation we have from God
[1:08:56] is Rich there's still the possibility
[1:08:59] that in the midst of all of this
[1:09:01] revelation we hang up or we somehow
[1:09:04] disconnect ourselves from fellowship
[1:09:07] with him listen church God is not just
[1:09:10] about relationship he's also about
[1:09:13] fellowship and if you don't believe that
[1:09:15] just remember he came down in the cool
[1:09:18] of the evening he was already Papa he
[1:09:21] was already God to Adam and to Eve but
[1:09:24] now he wanted to be in fellowship with
[1:09:28] them it's a reason why the God above us
[1:09:32] became a god with us and eventually a
[1:09:34] God in us because he was looking for
[1:09:37] fellowship and so when we replace him
[1:09:41] with all of the other pretties in life
[1:09:44] and with all of the other distractions
[1:09:46] in life then it's really us who pushes
[1:09:49] him to the back of the closet it's
[1:09:51] really us who says I don't have time to
[1:09:54] read today I don't have time to pray
[1:09:56] today well I want you to know if you
[1:09:58] don't read every day if you don't pray
[1:10:01] every day if you don't hear even a small
[1:10:03] portion of the word every day it won't
[1:10:06] take a week to be
[1:10:08] disconnected but I want you to remember
[1:10:10] that at the end of this study I want you
[1:10:12] to know that it's just as easy to
[1:10:16] reconnect it's just as e he's as close
[1:10:19] as the mention of his name he's as close
[1:10:22] as the opening of his word he's as close
[1:10:25] as is listening to a
[1:10:26] tape he's just that close you just have
[1:10:30] to focus on him you have to turn your
[1:10:33] attention away from all the other things
[1:10:35] in life that grab us in this hour and
[1:10:37] you have to set aside time for him your
[1:10:40] time with him is more important than the
[1:10:43] time with your boyfriend or your
[1:10:45] girlfriend or your husband or your wife
[1:10:47] or your siblings come on it's more
[1:10:50] important than your Christmas
[1:10:52] meal Fellowship
[1:10:55] with him abiding in him and him abiding
[1:11:01] in you we've already talked about in
[1:11:04] this series that one of the ways the
[1:11:06] scripture tells us that we can make sure
[1:11:09] that his words abide in US is by not
[1:11:13] only reading his word but meditating on
[1:11:16] his word I think we've clarified already
[1:11:19] in this series that it's not it's not
[1:11:22] transcendental uh meditation it's not
[1:11:25] Eastern mysticism meditation it's not
[1:11:28] yoga and and all of the spookies that go
[1:11:30] with that that we're talking about we're
[1:11:32] talking about biblical meditation and in
[1:11:35] the scripture remember uh the the the
[1:11:38] verses especially in Psalms are very
[1:11:41] clear uh Psalm 77:12 I will meditate
[1:11:45] also of all thy Work and talk of thy
[1:11:49] doings Psalm 19:14 let the words of my
[1:11:53] mouth and the meditation of my heart be
[1:11:56] acceptable in thy sight oh Lord my
[1:11:59] strength and my redeemer and we found
[1:12:02] out that in Hebrew the word meditate
[1:12:04] there means to utter a
[1:12:08] sound it means to to moan to to to to
[1:12:13] meditate to
[1:12:16] mutter what a strange word what a
[1:12:19] strange meaning to mutter but how many
[1:12:22] of you find yourself muttering to
[1:12:24] yourself
[1:12:27] uh what that mean and I I'm so happy
[1:12:29] that the scriptures are clear here in
[1:12:32] the Hebrew because I want you to know
[1:12:34] something we know from brain science
[1:12:38] that you just forming the
[1:12:41] words with your mouth as you
[1:12:45] read you don't even have to vocalize
[1:12:48] them but you're just reading here you
[1:12:56] have you ever done that is Grandpa the
[1:12:58] only one that's ever done that I
[1:13:01] remember my grandfather doing that
[1:13:03] reading the paper not only that the new
[1:13:05] the newspaper you know what that is and
[1:13:08] it rink I can hear him I can shut my
[1:13:10] eyes right now and hear my papa opening
[1:13:13] up the newspaper when he went to put it
[1:13:16] away he made sure that every section was
[1:13:17] in and he and he did it on the arm of
[1:13:20] the chair and got it all packed up
[1:13:23] together and and and I can hear him now
[1:13:25] that thin newspaper and I can he would
[1:13:28] put his hand behind it like that and I
[1:13:29] can hear him pointing putting his finger
[1:13:32] on the newspaper and pointing at
[1:13:34] something as he muttered along reading
[1:13:36] to himself what he was reading in his
[1:13:39] mind and brain science tells us that
[1:13:42] that takes our memory and our
[1:13:45] comprehension with understanding to
[1:13:47] another
[1:13:50] level so the meaning is not just to read
[1:13:53] to yourself and meditate and think on on
[1:13:55] it but it's also as you're reading let
[1:13:58] you let your at least your lips form the
[1:14:01] words and perhaps if possible maybe
[1:14:05] you'd even make a little sound or you
[1:14:07] might go as far as I do sometimes
[1:14:09] sitting in my office I just read it
[1:14:12] aloud if it's going to help me remember
[1:14:14] it if it's going to help me understand
[1:14:16] it if it's going to help me to keep my
[1:14:18] mind on the Lord and his words abiding
[1:14:20] in me I'll just read it out loud if it's
[1:14:22] appropriate to do so and if if it's not
[1:14:25] I just might do it
[1:14:26] anyway I might just sit down on a bench
[1:14:29] in the mall and just start reading it
[1:14:31] out loud you never know you just never
[1:14:33] know you could probably draw a crowd sir
[1:14:37] so the word meditate is is the act of
[1:14:40] thoughtful deliberation with the
[1:14:42] implication
[1:14:45] of it's very spiritual to talk to
[1:14:48] yourself I can prove it to you right
[1:14:51] here now brother brandham tells us and
[1:14:54] we've read this one already in presuming
[1:14:57] but let's look at it again he said you
[1:14:59] know I I heard someone was in a meeting
[1:15:01] here some time ago someone said just let
[1:15:04] your mind go blank now just look right
[1:15:07] straight up towards the sky let your
[1:15:09] mind go blank you'll get an
[1:15:12] experience oh dear he said and no doubt
[1:15:16] but what you do that's right but you get
[1:15:18] an experience but what an experience you
[1:15:21] see when you do that you just open your
[1:15:23] soul mind will and emotion to Satan
[1:15:25] he'll give you something that's true he
[1:15:29] said but I think a person coming to
[1:15:31] Christ should come with all the
[1:15:33] intelligence they got and quoting in
[1:15:35] their
[1:15:37] mind when they come to him every promise
[1:15:40] in the scripture brother bandom said
[1:15:43] keep your mind Al alert not idle alert
[1:15:47] when you come when you come to Christ
[1:15:51] don't let it go blank the devil will
[1:15:53] make you do anything see there give you
[1:15:55] a sensation he can do that too but you
[1:15:58] want an
[1:15:59] experience something that the Bible
[1:16:02] teaches something that's real now don't
[1:16:05] misunderstand he's not teaching us
[1:16:07] against a real spiritual experience he's
[1:16:10] just saying you want the kind that's
[1:16:12] grounded in the Bible you want the kind
[1:16:15] that's in the word you don't want to let
[1:16:18] your mind go blank and have some Demon
[1:16:20] talk to you you want to come meditating
[1:16:23] on the word he said then they go away
[1:16:25] presuming well a little nerve Shook and
[1:16:27] I saw a light or something like that I
[1:16:29] got it and they never here's the key if
[1:16:32] you want somebody to have any confidence
[1:16:35] in your experience with the Lord number
[1:16:37] one let it be based in the word number
[1:16:40] two Let it cause you to live higher let
[1:16:45] it cause you to live different than you
[1:16:47] were living before it's the fruit it's
[1:16:50] the fruit that testifies of the reality
[1:16:53] of the experience
[1:16:55] even if it's rooted and grounded in
[1:16:57] scripture he said they never live any
[1:17:00] different they just go right on out
[1:17:01] don't you let that be your habit don't
[1:17:06] let that happen to you so we discovered
[1:17:09] many things about true meditation and
[1:17:13] then on Tuesday night we looked at
[1:17:14] Philippians chapter
[1:17:16] 4: 6-9 he said be careful for nothing
[1:17:20] but in everything by prayer and
[1:17:22] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[1:17:25] request be made known unto God Amen and
[1:17:28] the peace of God here it is for every
[1:17:32] troubling thought for every moment of
[1:17:34] anxiety for every worry for every
[1:17:37] unnecessary concern let the peace of God
[1:17:41] which passes passes all understanding it
[1:17:45] will keep
[1:17:47] your hearts not your blood
[1:17:50] pump but the Lev in Hebrew the the the
[1:17:54] seat of all human emotion and your mind
[1:17:58] through Christ Jesus how is our mind
[1:18:02] kept through Christ Jesus in peace in
[1:18:06] Shalom now remember about that word
[1:18:09] Shalom you know people know it from
[1:18:11] Modern Hebrew as only a greeting but I
[1:18:14] want to say hello in in Israel we say
[1:18:17] shalom and when you're departing you say
[1:18:19] shalom shalom double double greeting and
[1:18:23] that's all that people understand about
[1:18:25] Shalom but the reality is it's really a
[1:18:27] question when someone greets you and
[1:18:30] says Shalom they're really asking you in
[1:18:33] Hebrew how is your
[1:18:37] peace Shalom how is your peace and you
[1:18:42] say you usually answer in modern Hebrew
[1:18:44] anyway you would say
[1:18:46] beset and beset means order in order so
[1:18:51] how is your peace and you would answer
[1:18:54] in order
[1:18:56] now we can say that as part of the Bride
[1:19:00] because our peace is not dependent on
[1:19:04] circumstances we can be in the middle of
[1:19:07] a storm and have peace because our peace
[1:19:11] is more than a feeling it's the presence
[1:19:15] of a person Jesus is our peace and so no
[1:19:20] matter what's going on our answer can be
[1:19:23] in order how is your your peace mine is
[1:19:25] in order because my peace comes from the
[1:19:29] reality of having Jesus Christ Living
[1:19:33] inside of
[1:19:34] me so we know that finally Brethren
[1:19:37] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[1:19:40] things are honest whatsoever things are
[1:19:42] just whatsoever things are pure
[1:19:44] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[1:19:46] things are of good report if there be
[1:19:48] any virtue and if there be any praise
[1:19:51] would you help me with reading the rest
[1:19:53] of that
[1:19:55] think on these things you're not going
[1:19:57] to find those things in the news you're
[1:20:00] not going to find those things on
[1:20:02] Facebook
[1:20:04] Instagram any of the other you're not
[1:20:05] going to find those things there most of
[1:20:07] the time you're only going to find those
[1:20:10] virtuous holy pure lovely things in
[1:20:13] God's word if you abide in me Jesus said
[1:20:16] and my words abide in you so keep the
[1:20:20] word of God ever before
[1:20:23] you it's not religious to have scripture
[1:20:26] in your home it's
[1:20:30] right it's right it's a good idea to
[1:20:35] remind yourself I've got all kinds of
[1:20:38] little notes and and stickies and
[1:20:40] everything else around my work area I
[1:20:43] want to remind myself even I can forget
[1:20:46] sometime one phone call can disturb your
[1:20:49] peace one text can send you into a tail
[1:20:52] spin come on but if you've got the word
[1:20:55] ever before you and you're letting that
[1:20:57] word abide in you then God's fruit's
[1:21:00] going to come out of that of that
[1:21:02] relationship and out of that Fellowship
[1:21:05] so these are lovely things he said those
[1:21:07] things which you have both learned and
[1:21:09] received and heard and seen in me do and
[1:21:14] the God of Peace the God of Peace in
[1:21:18] Hebrew SAR Shalom the Prince of Peace
[1:21:22] shall be with you if you believe that he
[1:21:25] is then say Amen doesn't matter what's
[1:21:28] going on around you so one of the ways
[1:21:30] is to read and study God's word and
[1:21:33] study as a part of that meditation read
[1:21:36] and study the scripture well I'm not a
[1:21:38] preacher that's not my job no it's your
[1:21:40] privilege it may not be your job it's
[1:21:43] your privilege we're not we're not Roman
[1:21:47] Catholic where the the book is in a
[1:21:49] language that the common man can't even
[1:21:51] understand God has preserved the word
[1:21:54] for you in a language that you can
[1:21:56] comprehend and if you don't put your
[1:21:58] face in that
[1:22:01] book then you need not spend any time
[1:22:04] doing anything else and study means look
[1:22:07] at it carefully you don't have to be a
[1:22:09] scholar you don't have to be a linguist
[1:22:11] you don't have to understand Biblical
[1:22:14] Hebrew or Greek you can get you a
[1:22:16] Webster's Dictionary and the spirit of
[1:22:19] Truth when you're filled with the spirit
[1:22:22] of Truth you take the Bible look up a
[1:22:23] word you don't understand and brother
[1:22:25] you can get somewhere and we should do
[1:22:28] that as
[1:22:30] Believers oh my well didn't what about a
[1:22:32] sister I didn't think she was supposed
[1:22:34] to handle the word brother brandom is
[1:22:36] talking about you trying to use that
[1:22:38] word to straighten someone else out you
[1:22:41] have every right to take that book up
[1:22:43] for yourself not so that you can preach
[1:22:46] it your husband but so that you can line
[1:22:48] up with
[1:22:51] it every right to every spiritual gift
[1:22:56] don't let that slip from you and then
[1:23:00] one of the other Keys is to
[1:23:03] focus you would think that you'd never
[1:23:06] have to tell somebody the importance of
[1:23:08] focusing on something but we're in an
[1:23:10] hour now where we have to really focus I
[1:23:13] I think modern language they they say
[1:23:15] things like being conscience you you've
[1:23:18] got to be in the moment you've got to be
[1:23:20] present someone said that sounds weird
[1:23:22] to me it doesn't to me
[1:23:24] because I've had enough conversations
[1:23:26] with people who physically are in the
[1:23:29] room I'm preaching to
[1:23:33] you physically their body is in the room
[1:23:35] but their mind is somewhere else it's on
[1:23:38] some Netflix series or something you
[1:23:41] know they're they're either thinking
[1:23:43] about what they would rather be doing or
[1:23:46] they're thinking about what they're
[1:23:47] going to say to you what their answer is
[1:23:49] going to be so they're not really
[1:23:52] listening to you so this is an hour
[1:23:55] where uh you know we used to kind of
[1:23:57] make ADHD a a a uh you know a small
[1:24:01] group of people but now we realize that
[1:24:04] most everybody in our lives is on the
[1:24:06] Spectrum
[1:24:09] come come on I I mean really does anyone
[1:24:13] know anybody that doesn't show a little
[1:24:14] bit of the signs of I
[1:24:16] don't and that's elderly all the way
[1:24:19] down to little ones and we're doing that
[1:24:22] yes
[1:24:26] we're doing that if you don't like what
[1:24:28] you read you just thumb it sir you just
[1:24:31] scroll it when we come to God's house
[1:24:34] there's no room to scroll we have to
[1:24:35] take what we like and we have to take
[1:24:38] what cuts us a little bit when we're
[1:24:41] going to make sure that the word of God
[1:24:43] abides in us we're going to sit down and
[1:24:45] study a little bit going to read it a
[1:24:47] little bit we've got to let it be our
[1:24:50] Focus we've got to be present we've got
[1:24:53] to be ious of what we're doing if we're
[1:24:55] going to hear a tape we need to set
[1:24:57] aside some time now this doesn't mean
[1:24:59] that you can't let the word play while
[1:25:02] you're doing something else because even
[1:25:04] sleeping your subconscious mind can pick
[1:25:07] up some of those
[1:25:09] truths but if you really want to grow
[1:25:12] from the word that you're looking at
[1:25:13] you've got to focus on that word which
[1:25:16] means to be extremely diligent in your
[1:25:19] efforts to tune out
[1:25:22] distractions oh it's
[1:25:25] quiet are you
[1:25:27] distracted and focus fully on what
[1:25:31] you're reading or on the message that
[1:25:34] you're listening to if possible make
[1:25:37] some
[1:25:38] notes did you know that's another brain
[1:25:40] science
[1:25:41] reinforcement did you know writing it
[1:25:44] down will help you to remember and going
[1:25:47] back and revisiting that between 24 and
[1:25:50] 48 hours will cause that little piece of
[1:25:53] inform
[1:25:54] to be deeper wired in the hypoc campus
[1:25:57] of the
[1:25:58] brain I mean you know it it amazes me
[1:26:01] sometimes because brother brandom taught
[1:26:04] us these things throughout the message
[1:26:06] particularly in the message the greatest
[1:26:09] battle ever fought and most of brother
[1:26:11] brandom's Ministry took place in a time
[1:26:14] where brain science did not believe in
[1:26:19] neuroplasticity meaning that people
[1:26:22] believed even scientists in those days
[1:26:25] believe you are you are stuck with the
[1:26:29] brain that you're born
[1:26:32] with you can't improve it you can't take
[1:26:36] away from it age will eventually cause
[1:26:39] you to lose cells along the way but
[1:26:43] there's no changing of the brain so
[1:26:46] brother brandom is talking about
[1:26:48] claiming the promises of God and
[1:26:50] speaking them out loud over and over and
[1:26:54] over again and somebody said even if you
[1:26:56] even if you don't feel it or what
[1:26:58] feeling what does feeling have to do
[1:27:00] with it he said he said in fact just
[1:27:02] keep say even if you don't see any
[1:27:03] manifestation of it just keep I'm
[1:27:06] Healed I am healed well well you know
[1:27:10] what he's he is teaching us the power of
[1:27:13] Faith but he's also teaching us the
[1:27:16] ability to
[1:27:18] rewire our brain to stop listening to
[1:27:22] symptoms
[1:27:25] and start holding on to God sir in faith
[1:27:30] the next thing you know he said you just
[1:27:32] keep saying that I'm Healed I'm Healed
[1:27:34] I'm Healed and he said before long faith
[1:27:37] kicks in and God causes your body
[1:27:42] sir to
[1:27:44] obey the confession that has come out of
[1:27:47] your mouth is anybody with me this is
[1:27:50] our Authority this is what God's given
[1:27:53] to the bride
[1:27:55] the the ability and while doing that we
[1:27:58] are rewiring our brain toward Faith
[1:28:02] we're pulling it away from doubt we're
[1:28:04] pulling it away from darkness and
[1:28:07] anxiety and we're creating a new
[1:28:11] environment does that sound too weird if
[1:28:14] it does I apologize that you're that far
[1:28:17] behind but we've been studying this for
[1:28:20] years now and you know what I sent a
[1:28:23] little text out on for Friday you'd be
[1:28:24] surprised how many answers I got from
[1:28:27] people who said I'm practicing this and
[1:28:30] I'm finding out that it works it doesn't
[1:28:33] just work some of the time it works all
[1:28:36] the time if you'll remain extremely
[1:28:39] diligent and you'll just confess that
[1:28:41] word you'll just conf when that negative
[1:28:43] thought comes before you let that whole
[1:28:46] negative story unfold in your mind if
[1:28:49] you'll pull that thing down like the
[1:28:51] scripture tells us to do and force it
[1:28:54] under the blood of Jesus Christ and then
[1:28:56] form a better
[1:28:58] thought I'm
[1:29:01] Healed you don't have to be you know you
[1:29:04] don't have to be brilliant about it I'm
[1:29:07] I'm
[1:29:09] Healed we wake up with a new symptom
[1:29:12] what do we do we run to
[1:29:16] Google we see what Dr Google
[1:29:21] says someone told me this weekend my
[1:29:24] office I had such and such a syndrome I
[1:29:27] said I shouldn't have went to
[1:29:31] Google when Benjamin was a little boy
[1:29:34] and and we didn't go to Google there was
[1:29:37] no Google to go to I don't guess we went
[1:29:39] to a doctor we went to a pediatrician
[1:29:41] for his regular little checkup and that
[1:29:44] was before they divorced us because we
[1:29:46] wouldn't take all of every every piece
[1:29:48] of advice they had we wouldn't take it
[1:29:50] and and so they just finally cancelled
[1:29:52] us we were the beginning of the cancel
[1:29:54] culture they just canel us you can't
[1:29:56] come back here anymore I was all right
[1:29:59] he was a little flaky
[1:30:01] anyway we he's in Benjamin's in there
[1:30:03] for a regular checkup and and he and he
[1:30:05] looked at him and he said
[1:30:08] my his eyes look a little gray the the
[1:30:12] whites of his eyes look a little gray he
[1:30:14] said did you know that that this is the
[1:30:16] doctor now the one taking the money I'm
[1:30:19] not going to mention that he was from
[1:30:21] Canada
[1:30:24] so it's my
[1:30:25] wife and she he said his eyes look
[1:30:29] mighty gr he said did you know that's
[1:30:30] early signs of brittle bone
[1:30:34] disease no no we didn't know that we
[1:30:38] didn't know that but I don't believe
[1:30:40] it told my wife all the way home he
[1:30:43] doesn't have brittle bone
[1:30:44] disease don't even let that come in our
[1:30:47] mind anymore brittle bone
[1:30:50] disease no way
[1:30:54] I didn't get to go to the doctor every
[1:30:55] time but a few times later he's back for
[1:30:58] those aggravating
[1:31:01] checkups you know can I just call you
[1:31:03] when I need you that's that's my that's
[1:31:05] my doctor approach and they know it they
[1:31:07] laugh when they see me
[1:31:09] coming you must be
[1:31:11] sick but isn't that what a doctor's
[1:31:14] for anyway uh I was back a few months
[1:31:18] later and I said to him I said well you
[1:31:21] know you mentioned when we were in here
[1:31:23] and
[1:31:25] that his eyes were gray and that it
[1:31:27] could be a sign of brittle bone disease
[1:31:29] are you going to test him are you going
[1:31:30] to check him I mean we don't believe he
[1:31:32] has it but are you going to make oh he
[1:31:34] said no no no it can mean a lot of other
[1:31:35] things
[1:31:39] too so so you know stay away from
[1:31:44] Google and stay away from googly doctors
[1:31:47] sometime
[1:31:49] sometime a a and and and go with faith
[1:31:54] right no matter what they say you
[1:31:56] appreciate them thank God for them we
[1:31:58] are not against doctors we're not
[1:32:01] against medicine we're not in suggesting
[1:32:04] that you should be we're just saying a
[1:32:07] lot of times a bad report will put you
[1:32:10] in fear and anxiety and you're going to
[1:32:12] have to come back and get prayer anyway
[1:32:14] so you might as well start off from the
[1:32:16] beginning I am
[1:32:18] healed regardless of what I have I am
[1:32:21] healed Hallelujah he's sitting in the
[1:32:25] barber chair I am healed I want to tell
[1:32:27] you the Church of Christ Barber you know
[1:32:29] I am healed he said well you don't look
[1:32:33] healed he said vs I know you still had
[1:32:35] to feel your way to get in the chair he
[1:32:37] said I'm Healed I am healed I am healed
[1:32:40] and all of a
[1:32:44] sudden let me say I don't believe in
[1:32:46] such as that you ought to you ought to
[1:32:49] believe in it the next thing you know
[1:32:51] he's halfway down the block
[1:32:54] yes sir seeing healed and here come the
[1:32:57] little Church of Christ Barber behind
[1:33:00] him God knows how to make a Believer out
[1:33:03] of your
[1:33:04] neighbor praise God so you get in that
[1:33:08] word let that word be your focus you
[1:33:10] know this I know this is 101 but we need
[1:33:13] it we need to be reminded you have a
[1:33:15] choice let me tell you something folks
[1:33:17] you have a choice of what you focus
[1:33:21] on the government doesn't own your
[1:33:23] ability to focus you can focus on God's
[1:33:26] word if you choose
[1:33:28] to that's right you don't have to hear a
[1:33:31] negative report too you can hang
[1:33:34] up you can tell somebody I've heard
[1:33:37] enough I've got to focus on the word of
[1:33:40] God and as we focus he opens our
[1:33:43] understanding and that word
[1:33:45] understanding to consider and carefully
[1:33:47] Ponder how God is speaking about himself
[1:33:51] even the world and personally to your
[1:33:54] heart understanding comes by Spirit the
[1:33:58] spirit of Truth opens the word to you
[1:34:01] individually we're not talking about
[1:34:03] Doctrine now we're talking about
[1:34:05] personal connection to the vine am sir
[1:34:10] that's right if you're not connected to
[1:34:12] the vine there's no life flowing into
[1:34:15] you right now brother brandom tells us
[1:34:18] in the message the mark of the beast is
[1:34:20] that too old of a sermon for you to get
[1:34:22] anything out of it's not for
[1:34:25] me 54 paragraph 171 he said there is how
[1:34:29] it come in there is how it goes out
[1:34:32] exactly a bowing and a forcing to a half
[1:34:36] he bowing excuse me and a forcing to a
[1:34:39] half Heathen religion and God stepping
[1:34:42] in the in the crucial hour and writing
[1:34:45] in unknown tongues and the man
[1:34:47] interprets it how many of you know he's
[1:34:49] in Daniel he could interpret he didn't
[1:34:52] he he didn't know that language nobody
[1:34:54] else knowed it but he had the same holy
[1:34:56] ghost that led him interpret that it's
[1:35:00] the same holy
[1:35:03] ghost in the church today he said you
[1:35:06] call it fanaticism where are you going
[1:35:08] with this just hang on you call it
[1:35:10] fanaticism I'll admit they got a lot of
[1:35:13] it but brother but brother but
[1:35:17] brother there but brother there's a real
[1:35:20] one there too
[1:35:25] I'm weary of someone who always talks
[1:35:27] about only the fanaticism and never
[1:35:30] stops to mention that the Pentecostal
[1:35:33] skies are full of the
[1:35:35] genuine we're not talking about
[1:35:37] Pentecost as a denomination we're
[1:35:39] talking about Pentecost as an
[1:35:42] experience and that's why brother
[1:35:44] brandom said well I'm Pentecostal from
[1:35:46] the top of my head to the souls of my
[1:35:47] feet not connected to an
[1:35:50] organization but have had an experience
[1:35:54] [Music]
[1:35:55] you've met the pillar of fire he said
[1:35:58] the devil throws every counterfeit he
[1:36:00] can right in the
[1:36:01] way why to confuse
[1:36:05] you and if you don't think no more
[1:36:08] here's the key this is big and if you
[1:36:10] don't think no more of
[1:36:12] God then get down and read your Bible
[1:36:16] and pray and ask
[1:36:18] God then it goes to show
[1:36:24] make sure you're looking you're not very
[1:36:30] interested in your soul in your
[1:36:32] spiritual life are you awake yes you see
[1:36:36] so we don't just need it when we got a
[1:36:38] question or when we got a problem we
[1:36:40] need his word all the time and if you
[1:36:42] can't take time to get down and pray
[1:36:44] about something or look at God's word
[1:36:46] and see what the answers are you're not
[1:36:49] very interested brother vandom said
[1:36:50] you're not very interested in your soul
[1:36:53] is anybody interested in your inner man
[1:36:56] he said move right on out there and say
[1:36:58] God I don't care how many Old Crow
[1:37:00] baites you put out there I see your
[1:37:03] Bible says it and I'm determined that's
[1:37:07] right you promised it to me the Seed of
[1:37:11] Abraham he said God called you you'll
[1:37:14] come to it
[1:37:16] Hallelujah but if you're not I don't
[1:37:19] care how religious you are you're gone
[1:37:21] that's all you can't come no man can
[1:37:23] except he called you and he's not
[1:37:25] willing that any should perish listen to
[1:37:27] what brother brandom's telling him this
[1:37:29] is in
[1:37:31] Jeffersonville he said no man except he
[1:37:33] called you and he's not willing that any
[1:37:35] should perish but a lot of you
[1:37:40] will sounds to me like there was more
[1:37:43] than one
[1:37:45] indictment this sounds like an
[1:37:47] indictment here he said but a lot of you
[1:37:50] will because you're too unconcerned
[1:37:55] eared about
[1:37:57] it your soul your inner life if you're
[1:38:02] concerned about it you're going to spend
[1:38:04] some time in prayer and it's not a Santa
[1:38:07] Claus list it's a renewing of your
[1:38:11] commitment to Christ it's renewing your
[1:38:14] fellowship with him did you know prayer
[1:38:16] doesn't always have to be about asking
[1:38:18] for anything did you know there's a
[1:38:21] portion of our prayer that can just simp
[1:38:23] be thank you it can be
[1:38:26] praised but it's open communication with
[1:38:29] him and if we're concerned about abiding
[1:38:32] in the vine we're going to have to pray
[1:38:35] a
[1:38:36] little but I know the message but I know
[1:38:38] that I'm secure and I know I'm elected
[1:38:41] and I know I'm predestinated and I'm
[1:38:43] full of bride pride and all that goes
[1:38:46] with
[1:38:48] it but yet you say sometime I feel
[1:38:51] disconnected as though God God has
[1:38:53] decided to to hang up on you no no no
[1:38:57] it's us it's us are you still here
[1:39:00] enticing Spirits he said would you raise
[1:39:03] your hand somebody that didn't raise
[1:39:04] their hand a while ago he said God bless
[1:39:06] you Sister give us a little
[1:39:08] cord while we're have our heads bowed
[1:39:11] how how much do you really mean it he
[1:39:14] said don't play
[1:39:15] now this is not a playing time he said
[1:39:19] this is a receiving time this is a time
[1:39:23] that you must get it and then he said
[1:39:27] come dump it out right
[1:39:30] now he said will you come give all you
[1:39:33] got to God he said say God I I ain't got
[1:39:38] very much I'm just a little housewife I
[1:39:40] can't do very much Lord but I can read
[1:39:43] your Bible I can pray every day I can
[1:39:46] throw out all the trash that's in my
[1:39:51] mind brother sister that'll keep anybody
[1:39:54] busy man or woman read a little bit pray
[1:39:57] a little bit and keep the trash hauled
[1:39:59] out of your mind that will occupy the
[1:40:03] biggest majority of your spiritual life
[1:40:07] because we've come to the last battle
[1:40:10] and the last battle is not against the
[1:40:13] denomination the last battle is the one
[1:40:16] that takes place here not just in the
[1:40:19] church but in the bride greatest battle
[1:40:22] ever
[1:40:24] fought it's happening even
[1:40:27] now fear anxiety depression all kinds of
[1:40:32] mental illness trying to come in and set
[1:40:34] you at disease disease that's what
[1:40:38] disease does it takes us out of ease out
[1:40:41] of peace and it sets us at disease you
[1:40:45] don't have to settle for
[1:40:48] that you can
[1:40:50] overcome because you're connected to the
[1:40:52] Vine
[1:40:54] and the vine is where we find our
[1:40:56] overcoming strength I'm dumping it out I
[1:40:58] don't want
[1:40:59] it he said I you can pray every day I
[1:41:03] I'm guilty of a lot of things that
[1:41:04] preacher said this
[1:41:06] morning so I'm dumping it out today I
[1:41:09] don't want it God fill me with love fill
[1:41:12] me with the thing that makes me love the
[1:41:15] bitterest enemy
[1:41:23] it's crickets in
[1:41:26] here that's how you know that you're
[1:41:30] praying and your reading and your
[1:41:33] Revelation has done something for you
[1:41:36] your experience has helped you it's
[1:41:39] changed you because now you're learning
[1:41:41] to
[1:41:44] love and remember that's not love in
[1:41:46] word only because real love is not just
[1:41:49] manifested in word it's manifested In
[1:41:53] Deed need are you here when you start
[1:41:56] loving the bitterest enemy of God I
[1:41:58] really want it Lord then you know you're
[1:42:00] making some progress
[1:42:02] here I want to read this to you and
[1:42:05] you're going to find in just a moment
[1:42:08] something else to
[1:42:11] criticize so get
[1:42:13] ready
[1:42:16] charity but I'm going to read first
[1:42:19] Matthew chapter
[1:42:21] 14 beginning in verse 22 and straightway
[1:42:25] Jesus constrained his
[1:42:27] disciples to get into a
[1:42:30] ship and go before him unto the other
[1:42:34] side while he sent the multitudes
[1:42:37] away and when he had sent the multitudes
[1:42:40] away he went up into a mountain apart to
[1:42:42] pray and when the evening was come he
[1:42:45] was there alone so now he's prayed all
[1:42:48] day
[1:42:48] [Music]
[1:42:51] long he was there alone
[1:42:54] the evening is
[1:42:55] here the beginning of a new Hebrew day
[1:42:59] on the
[1:43:00] calendar he was there alone but the ship
[1:43:03] was now in the midst in the middle of
[1:43:07] the
[1:43:08] sea tossed with
[1:43:11] waves for the wind
[1:43:14] was has anybody been facing any contrary
[1:43:17] winds all of us I'm
[1:43:21] sure the wind was was contrary and in
[1:43:24] the Fourth Watch of the
[1:43:28] night nine hours have
[1:43:31] passed since Jesus said I'll go on to
[1:43:35] the other side I'll see you in the
[1:43:37] Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went
[1:43:40] unto
[1:43:42] them walking on the
[1:43:47] sea you surely know that's not
[1:43:50] metaphoric he was there and when the
[1:43:53] disciples saw him walking on the sea
[1:43:56] they were
[1:43:57] troubled saying it is a
[1:44:00] spirit and they cried out for fear you
[1:44:03] know anytime someone sees Jesus in a way
[1:44:06] they've never seen him
[1:44:08] before there's always a
[1:44:11] question let me tell you something Jesus
[1:44:13] is not offended by your
[1:44:15] questions just don't let your questions
[1:44:17] move you into doubt know that it's him
[1:44:21] know that he's there know that he's
[1:44:23] always
[1:44:24] present they cried out for fear in verse
[1:44:27] 27 but but straight way Jesus spake unto
[1:44:30] them saying be of good
[1:44:33] cheer it is
[1:44:36] I Be not
[1:44:38] Afraid and guess what somebody took him
[1:44:41] at his word there's always going to be
[1:44:44] somebody that takes God at his word and
[1:44:47] Peter answered him and said Lord if if
[1:44:51] if if if it be
[1:44:54] thou bid me come unto thee on the
[1:44:59] water if this is a ghost this is a
[1:45:02] spirit I have no desire to walk with it
[1:45:04] on the water but if this is the Lord I
[1:45:07] want to get out there he said come and
[1:45:10] Jesus said
[1:45:13] come this one red word in the midst of
[1:45:17] the of the of the black on your page and
[1:45:20] when Peter was come down out of the ship
[1:45:26] he walked on the water to go to
[1:45:28] Jesus but when he saw but when he saw
[1:45:33] the wind
[1:45:35] boisterous he was
[1:45:37] afraid and beginning to
[1:45:40] sink he cried
[1:45:43] saying come on Lord save
[1:45:46] me and
[1:45:48] immediately I I I want you to
[1:45:51] notice that there's so much language
[1:45:54] here in this did you know Matthew is the
[1:45:57] only one of the gospels that records
[1:45:59] that Peter walked on the
[1:46:01] water both Mark and John tell about the
[1:46:05] storm but they don't mention Peter
[1:46:08] walking on the
[1:46:09] water does that mean he didn't
[1:46:13] no it means that each each writer wrote
[1:46:16] the thing that was you
[1:46:19] know prevalent in their mind under the
[1:46:21] inspiration of the Holy Holy Spirit but
[1:46:24] I don't I don't throw it out because
[1:46:25] only one of the gospels mentions it this
[1:46:27] is too powerful immediately Jesus
[1:46:30] stretched forth his hand
[1:46:32] and and what and what did Jesus do he
[1:46:37] caught
[1:46:44] him you know what that
[1:46:46] means it means he wasn't over his head
[1:46:53] it means he hadn't sunk to the Bottom of
[1:46:55] the
[1:46:55] Sea it means that before he could ever
[1:46:58] go down all the way down Jesus caught
[1:47:05] him and he moved
[1:47:08] immediately he didn't say this would be
[1:47:10] a good time to teach Peter a
[1:47:13] lesson that's what your pastor might
[1:47:17] say well let's just see how he does down
[1:47:19] there sputtering around in the water but
[1:47:22] the B ible said immediately Jesus
[1:47:25] stretched forth his hand and caught him
[1:47:28] and said unto him oh thou of little
[1:47:31] faith wherefore D thou
[1:47:35] doubt and when they were come into the
[1:47:38] ship the
[1:47:43] wind then they that were in the ship
[1:47:46] came and worshiped him saying isn't it
[1:47:49] amazing they're they're in total fear Fe
[1:47:54] all of them the storm is
[1:47:56] horrendous and now a ghostlike figure is
[1:48:01] appearing to them on the water and now
[1:48:03] Peter's
[1:48:06] overboard there's a whole lot going on
[1:48:10] in a few minutes time now Peter and our
[1:48:13] Lord are on the boat and they're not
[1:48:15] shaking in fear anymore or mocking
[1:48:19] Peter they're worshiping him and saying
[1:48:22] of a
[1:48:23] truth Thou Art the Son of God if we
[1:48:27] didn't believe it before we believe it
[1:48:30] now after nine hours had passed Peter
[1:48:33] began to mutter where is
[1:48:35] Jesus I thought he was going to meet
[1:48:38] us their hearts were hardened and
[1:48:41] calloused by all of the things that they
[1:48:43] had been going
[1:48:45] through all of the persecution that was
[1:48:48] tightening
[1:48:49] in they had gathered up 12 baskets one
[1:48:52] for each to disciple in the miracle of
[1:48:53] the
[1:48:54] loaves every stroke of the ore would
[1:48:57] fasten their eyes upon the evidence of
[1:48:59] his
[1:49:01] power the fish that God always provided
[1:49:04] at the right time but they were blinded
[1:49:06] by their own Sweat by their own labor by
[1:49:09] their own work men and women who focus
[1:49:11] on the
[1:49:13] darkness become like the darkness that
[1:49:15] they focus on they cry I can't live this
[1:49:19] way I can't give that
[1:49:21] much but behind every
[1:49:24] excuse is simply a lack of
[1:49:30] Desire the Lord now brings a requirement
[1:49:32] to his people not by the letter but by
[1:49:34] the spirit he summons arise get out of
[1:49:37] the boat walk on my
[1:49:40] word during the fourth and final watch
[1:49:42] King Jesus goes for a stroll on the tops
[1:49:45] of the watery
[1:49:48] Billows he showed up that night in a
[1:49:50] form they had never seen before they
[1:49:52] shrieked in fear only Peter had the
[1:49:56] courage to even ask Lord is that you if
[1:50:00] so bid me come his faith had been
[1:50:03] stirred by the revelation of who the
[1:50:05] king really
[1:50:06] was remember he had met him in Bonas
[1:50:10] cesaria
[1:50:11] Philippi whom to men say that I the son
[1:50:14] of man
[1:50:15] am some say th th John the Baptist or
[1:50:19] Elias or one of the prophets come back
[1:50:21] from the dead who do you say that I the
[1:50:23] son of man am Thou Art the Messiah Thou
[1:50:26] Art the Christ you are the anointed one
[1:50:30] and here remember this folks he says
[1:50:32] something that wasn't even a part of
[1:50:34] second temple
[1:50:36] theology very few people were believing
[1:50:39] in the time of Jesus that Messiah would
[1:50:41] be
[1:50:44] God and they had no real concept of God
[1:50:48] having a son so Peter didn't get this at
[1:50:51] the synagogue he didn't get this in the
[1:50:53] Bible School Jesus told him you didn't
[1:50:55] get this from mama or daddy Flesh and
[1:50:58] Blood hath not revealed this unto thee
[1:51:01] he said Thou Art the Christ the Messiah
[1:51:04] the Son of the Living
[1:51:06] God the disciples are probably looking
[1:51:08] around God has a
[1:51:13] son but Peter had it by
[1:51:16] Revelation Flesh and Blood didn't reveal
[1:51:18] this unto thee it is of my Father in
[1:51:20] Heaven Thou Art Peter Petra small
[1:51:25] Stone it indicates one chipped off of a
[1:51:28] larger
[1:51:30] rock that little piece of gravel is not
[1:51:33] enough for the church to be built on and
[1:51:36] yet Jesus said Thou Art blessed art thou
[1:51:39] Simon son of Jonah for flesh and blood
[1:51:41] but my Father which is in heaven Thou
[1:51:44] Art Peter and Upon This
[1:51:48] Rock I will build my church and the
[1:51:51] gates of hell shall not Prevail against
[1:51:54] it not on that little piece of gravel
[1:51:57] but on the solid rock of
[1:51:58] Revelation so Peter's already had some
[1:52:01] great
[1:52:04] experience and he's riding high on what
[1:52:08] God is revealed to
[1:52:13] him his faith had been
[1:52:16] stirred and Jesus had said it is I the
[1:52:20] Greek construction of these words here
[1:52:22] it's
[1:52:23] egoi and it literally means I
[1:52:26] am
[1:52:28] interesting I
[1:52:30] am Jesus
[1:52:32] answers and the words that are recorded
[1:52:35] in the King James are the Greek words
[1:52:39] not for it is I but I am and isn't that
[1:52:44] who he announced himself to be to Moses
[1:52:47] I am that I am so Jesus said is it is it
[1:52:51] you Lord is it you Lord if it's you bid
[1:52:53] me come he said I
[1:52:55] am the same God who sent Moses to
[1:52:58] Pharaoh is now walking across the water
[1:53:01] that night same God remember Jehovah of
[1:53:03] the old Jesus of the
[1:53:06] new Jesus Christ The Mystery of God
[1:53:11] revealed at first there was an if in
[1:53:14] Peter's words if it's you after all it
[1:53:17] still dark out there the grizzled
[1:53:19] fishermen were quite aware of the sea
[1:53:21] they knew the daughters they knew this
[1:53:23] was a big one he's now invited to step
[1:53:26] out of the safe place and into that
[1:53:28] which was totally unprecedented and he
[1:53:31] began to sling one leg over the side I
[1:53:33] can almost hear his fishing budding say
[1:53:35] oh my he's going to do
[1:53:40] it they didn't understand that he wasn't
[1:53:42] just walking on water he was walking on
[1:53:44] a word a word said
[1:53:48] come he heard it come
[1:53:52] I may not be able to walk on water but I
[1:53:54] can walk on a word as long as it comes
[1:53:57] from him if he said come then he's going
[1:54:00] to take care of me if I sink he's going
[1:54:03] to catch me if I drown he's going to
[1:54:05] revive me I'm not going to worry about
[1:54:08] how it turns out I'm just going to know
[1:54:10] that in the end he's I am Hallelujah
[1:54:14] he's still
[1:54:15] able and I'm going to step out I I I
[1:54:18] I've got a word I've got a word I've got
[1:54:20] a word nobody has a word like this
[1:54:23] little bride that we can stand on not
[1:54:26] just when things are good but when
[1:54:29] they're
[1:54:30] hellish when hounds of hell are against
[1:54:34] you when your family's falling apart
[1:54:36] when your children are backslid and
[1:54:38] running after the world when your body
[1:54:41] is failing you that's the
[1:54:44] hour to step out on the
[1:54:48] word hallelujah make sure you
[1:54:55] sir just trying not to
[1:55:00] be that's how I feel sister Flo
[1:55:05] wo that's when we need that's when we
[1:55:08] need him in moments like
[1:55:12] these remember I told you the other day
[1:55:14] I saw where brother Chris Kathy's
[1:55:18] wife was that a I I never mentioned it
[1:55:22] to him texting with him last night I
[1:55:23] should have mentioned it but she was at
[1:55:26] a Collingsworth concert and was sitting
[1:55:29] by a woman the woman introduced herself
[1:55:30] and it was the
[1:55:32] daughter of the woman who wrote the song
[1:55:34] in times like
[1:55:39] these we need an
[1:55:43] anchor that's where we are and we got it
[1:55:47] we don't have to go hunting him we don't
[1:55:49] have to go looking for him we know where
[1:55:52] he is as long as we've stayed
[1:55:55] connected as long as we've kept his word
[1:55:58] in
[1:55:59] us we're not know it alls so never have
[1:56:02] to look at it again never have to pray
[1:56:04] for deeper understanding again we're not
[1:56:07] people who are lazy and we depend on our
[1:56:10] pastors to do it
[1:56:12] all that's right we've learned what's
[1:56:15] available to
[1:56:20] us but what if i s
[1:56:23] Lord this was a sink or swim moment for
[1:56:27] Peter he's now invited to step out of
[1:56:30] his safe place and into that which was
[1:56:33] totally
[1:56:35] unprecedented buddies you know oh he's
[1:56:37] going to do it he's going to Peter of
[1:56:39] course it's
[1:56:41] Peter showbo
[1:56:46] Peter of course it's him what if I sink
[1:56:50] Lord
[1:56:52] have you ever asked him a similar
[1:56:55] question what if I sink
[1:56:58] Lord what if I say I'm heal and it
[1:57:00] doesn't go away now what if I testify
[1:57:04] that I'm Healed and I get
[1:57:06] worse don't you know that if he
[1:57:09] immediately moved to rescue Peter and he
[1:57:12] caught him before he was drowned caught
[1:57:15] him before he was under don't you know
[1:57:17] that if you'll step out on his word
[1:57:20] he'll catch you too that's right yes sir
[1:57:24] and when we look at that word
[1:57:26] caught he caught him verse 31 that word
[1:57:30] is a compound of again of two Greek
[1:57:33] words EPI and lambano and it means upon
[1:57:36] to take hold of and to
[1:57:39] seize it doesn't mean that Jesus just
[1:57:42] you know delicately with light touch of
[1:57:46] fingers just you know caresses him into
[1:57:50] the boat it means means he seized upon
[1:57:53] him it means he grabbed him with great
[1:57:56] determination perhaps even a little
[1:57:58] violence to someone looking on because
[1:58:01] there's a time to be
[1:58:03] pretty and there's a time to be serious
[1:58:07] and Jesus knew this is a serious moment
[1:58:09] for
[1:58:10] Peter Cuz if I let him go he's going to
[1:58:12] keep looking at the wind and the wave
[1:58:15] and he's going to find the Bottom of the
[1:58:16] Sea of Galilee pretty soon he's going to
[1:58:19] swim like a rock I'm sure of it so
[1:58:22] quickly he seized on him took a hold of
[1:58:25] him let me tell you something Jesus will
[1:58:27] always reach down always reach down to
[1:58:31] embrace you we're always safe when he is
[1:58:35] near would you cut the lights
[1:58:40] please if a movie offends you you can

[2:06:56] please I'm sorry please don't peace be
[2:07:14] still I wanted you to see that part it's
[2:07:18] very hard to see because it's it's
[2:07:20] supposed to be in the dark that's
[2:07:23] perhaps what it would have been
[2:07:25] like I know there's additional language
[2:07:28] and I know that this is someone's
[2:07:29] thoughts of how it could be portrayed
[2:07:32] and if you get caught up in that you'll
[2:07:34] miss the point the point is this don't
[2:07:36] let me
[2:07:40] go that's what I wanted you to see don't
[2:07:43] let me
[2:07:46] go now in this in this The Chosen
[2:07:50] Peter's going through something
[2:07:52] his wife is going through something
[2:07:54] they've taken some Liberty it's okay
[2:07:56] with me but I want to know exactly what
[2:07:59] happened I go to the Bible right but for
[2:08:03] me the visual Peter's
[2:08:06] struggling he's had a revelation he's
[2:08:08] still struggling have you had a
[2:08:11] revelation do you ever
[2:08:13] struggle come on don't be religious be
[2:08:17] real sure we struggle
[2:08:22] it's you is it
[2:08:24] you and he's angry he's carrying some
[2:08:27] anger have you ever carried any as a
[2:08:29] Christian as a Believer have there been
[2:08:32] circumstances in your life that just
[2:08:34] made you angry you didn't know who to be
[2:08:36] angry
[2:08:37] with and sometimes we even take it out
[2:08:40] on the Lord as though he's the one who
[2:08:43] did it and that's a little bit of what's
[2:08:44] going on here but Peter finds his faith
[2:08:48] he gets out of the
[2:08:49] boat and once he sees what it's like to
[2:08:52] be without
[2:08:54] him he knows I can never be without him
[2:08:57] again what speaks to me in that scene is
[2:09:02] it's not the details of the conversation
[2:09:04] but once he's back in the
[2:09:06] boat Jesus is going to stand up and calm
[2:09:08] the
[2:09:09] storm and Peter won't turn him
[2:09:14] loose do what you got to do but don't
[2:09:16] let me go don't let me go don't let me
[2:09:19] go that's what I'm preaching
[2:09:21] if you abide in
[2:09:23] me and my words abide in
[2:09:26] you you've got the
[2:09:29] check it's an abiding it's a continuing
[2:09:32] it's a don't let me go that's what it is
[2:09:37] in the message and I'm coming to a close
[2:09:39] at Thy word
[2:09:41] Lord I saw that this was preached in
[2:09:44] Wood River Illinois so it made me think
[2:09:46] of all the precious Saints we've known
[2:09:48] from Wood River all of them with the
[2:09:50] Lord ports with the
[2:09:52] Lord sister Carolyn W Wason with the
[2:09:56] Lord brother and
[2:09:59] sister
[2:10:02] uh their names Kesler brother and sister
[2:10:06] Kesler with the Lord from Wood River
[2:10:08] they were in this
[2:10:09] meeting I think of Peter when the Lord
[2:10:12] told him said come walking on the waters
[2:10:15] why Peter never walked on the water
[2:10:17] never heard of anybody else walking on
[2:10:19] water I don't know how to walk on water
[2:10:23] Lord but at Thy
[2:10:26] word you do notice that brother
[2:10:28] brandom's adding a little word or two
[2:10:29] there so don't get offended at the at
[2:10:32] the
[2:10:34] clip but at Thy word here I come and
[2:10:38] look at what it said and he
[2:10:42] did he
[2:10:43] did in the message perfect Faith
[2:10:46] musicians will you slip this
[2:10:48] way Peter he was doing all right to got
[2:10:53] scared the word told him he could walk
[2:10:55] on the water he was scared first he
[2:10:58] thought it was a ghost He said Lord if
[2:11:00] it be you bid me come on the
[2:11:05] Water Peter he was said come on now
[2:11:09] that's just the same as James 5:14 same
[2:11:12] as Mark 16 the same God said it said
[2:11:15] come on brother Bam's reminding us the
[2:11:18] one who said come is the one who made
[2:11:21] the these other precious promises so he
[2:11:23] started walking he done all right got
[2:11:25] down out of the ship started
[2:11:27] walking there was a storm on the sea you
[2:11:30] know Great White Cap waves bigger than
[2:11:33] these hills around here foam breaking on
[2:11:36] top of them terrific maybe 15 20 feet
[2:11:39] foam the White Caps breaking and it was
[2:11:43] a terrific thing for him to ask if it Be
[2:11:46] You Lord see he looked there looked like
[2:11:49] a shadow or a spirit
[2:11:52] pretty
[2:11:52] similar because I know what you were
[2:11:55] thinking in your mind what I was
[2:11:56] thinking in my mind there's a storm
[2:11:59] going on and then an amazing
[2:12:02] Spotlight Out of Heaven shining on Jesus
[2:12:06] so he lights up the water that's not the
[2:12:09] way brother random saw it that's not the
[2:12:10] way the film saw it he's walking in the
[2:12:14] shadow he's not announcing all that he
[2:12:17] is he's just coming he said look like a
[2:12:21] adow or Spirit he said if it's you bid
[2:12:23] me come to you on the water Jesus said
[2:12:26] come on on and he stepped down and said
[2:12:30] it's the Lord I'll just
[2:12:32] walk but when he got his eyes on the
[2:12:36] waves he got scared what come in his
[2:12:38] mind first thing I'm going to walk
[2:12:40] because the word
[2:12:42] said for me to walk the first thing was
[2:12:45] the right thing and then the next thing
[2:12:48] he looked at his symptoms
[2:12:52] he looked out there and seen how big
[2:12:54] them waves was he got scared and when he
[2:12:56] did down he went see what he feared
[2:13:01] happened let's not pass over that what
[2:13:04] he
[2:13:05] feared happened what he
[2:13:09] believed happened when he believed he
[2:13:13] could
[2:13:15] walk my my my my my my my when he
[2:13:18] believed and got scared in his belief
[2:13:22] yeah faith is the
[2:13:27] substance when he got scared in his
[2:13:29] belief then his substance substance left
[2:13:32] him see he still professed his faith but
[2:13:36] he didn't H oh I've been
[2:13:40] there I've been
[2:13:42] there don't you sit
[2:13:45] smug like you've never been there your
[2:13:49] faith knew what was right right but your
[2:13:52] symptoms and your circumstances were
[2:13:55] howling against
[2:13:58] you he got scared in his belief his
[2:14:01] substance left him he still professed
[2:14:03] his faith but he didn't have the
[2:14:04] substance the substance would have went
[2:14:06] right over the top of that white cap and
[2:14:08] went right on to him see if he has the
[2:14:12] perfect Faith
[2:14:15] see but he didn't have it he thought he
[2:14:17] did he did it
[2:14:19] first he was willing to venture right
[2:14:21] out why the Lord told me to do it it's
[2:14:24] going to happen got to happen so he just
[2:14:27] steps right down out of the boat and
[2:14:28] takes off he never thought about the
[2:14:30] waves how contrary they was he never got
[2:14:33] that in his
[2:14:35] mind now when you get to
[2:14:38] thinking that's it we could stop the
[2:14:41] quote
[2:14:42] there when you get to
[2:14:45] thinking you go to sinking
[2:14:51] take that home with you when you go to
[2:14:54] thinking that's when you go to
[2:14:58] sinking he said well now waitting you
[2:15:00] know I've been sick so long
[2:15:04] stop you might just well go back to the
[2:15:06] boat see but when you quit thinking
[2:15:12] about that sir about what about the wind
[2:15:16] about the rain about the wave about the
[2:15:19] backslid Sun about the Wayward
[2:15:23] Daughter about some little something
[2:15:26] going on in the
[2:15:29] church about the guy on the job that's
[2:15:31] out to get
[2:15:37] you when you go to
[2:15:42] thinking you might as well go back to
[2:15:44] the boat and then in the in the message
[2:15:47] the resurrection of gyrus his
[2:15:49] daughter don't ever pass that one when
[2:15:52] you come to
[2:15:53] it you should hear it again and again
[2:15:57] and again and again all of them but all
[2:15:59] my this that is so
[2:16:02] sweet in paragraph 37 Peter asked him
[2:16:05] one night if it be you bid me come to
[2:16:06] you on the water and Jesus said come
[2:16:10] that's all Peter had to hear
[2:16:12] come he jumped out of the boat started
[2:16:14] running to meet him and even on his road
[2:16:17] when fear comes he saw the big waves the
[2:16:19] Big White Caps burst in probably as high
[2:16:21] as this building he got scared and as
[2:16:25] soon as he got scared dot dot
[2:16:31] dot see he got his mind off of what
[2:16:34] Christ said what' Christ say come do you
[2:16:38] really think that he's going to invite
[2:16:40] you into the midst of turmoil if he's
[2:16:43] not going to be there to catch
[2:16:47] you come he got
[2:16:49] scared like we do sometime he got his
[2:16:52] eyes on the
[2:16:54] symptoms he got to
[2:16:58] thinking and he began
[2:17:02] sinking oh Jesus if I can hold on to
[2:17:06] you I can have confidence that you're
[2:17:09] going to hold on to
[2:17:10] me I've mentioned this a lot
[2:17:15] lately tell me Mr
[2:17:19] brandom how did you hold on to your
[2:17:24] religion he's standing out there on the
[2:17:26] hill in the
[2:17:30] cemetery his wife is buried Sharon Rose
[2:17:34] buried there's nobody walking out from
[2:17:36] behind the tree this
[2:17:39] day he is as low as he can
[2:17:44] be in
[2:17:47] Emotion his circumstances are ugly his
[2:17:49] storm is great
[2:17:52] the government man man
[2:17:55] representative sees him standing out
[2:17:57] there on the you've ever been to the
[2:17:59] cemetery you know that sister Pope's
[2:18:02] grave is right on the highway almost
[2:18:04] just up the just up the
[2:18:06] hill you saw him standing there he got
[2:18:08] out walked up that way iser was his name
[2:18:10] wasn't it something like that tell me
[2:18:16] Billy how did you hold on to your
[2:18:18] religion walking through these dark
[2:18:21] places oh he said I
[2:18:23] didn't it held on to me Peter's in the
[2:18:27] boat don't let me go don't let me
[2:18:31] go I didn't know that charity I was
[2:18:34] preaching about it last Sunday she
[2:18:35] pulled it up but I didn't see the text I
[2:18:37] didn't know I just showed it to you then
[2:18:39] we talked about Peter in the film I
[2:18:42] don't know how real Peter looked but in
[2:18:43] the film if you could have seen he's
[2:18:47] short he had a little bit of short
[2:18:49] person syndrome
[2:18:51] he had big biceps that he wanted to show
[2:18:53] all the time you know he's a
[2:18:54] fisherman he's pretty confident a little
[2:18:58] arrogant but faithful loyal ready to
[2:19:02] fight for
[2:19:04] Jesus in the film they have him going
[2:19:06] through a personal crisis that's where
[2:19:08] it gets real when the enemy touches your
[2:19:13] wife when the enemy touches your child
[2:19:17] that's when it gets personal that's when
[2:19:18] the battle comes home
[2:19:20] and Peter
[2:19:22] struggling just seemed like the Lord
[2:19:24] wasn't doing enough for his situation in
[2:19:27] the
[2:19:28] film but that old strong
[2:19:33] masculine banty rooster
[2:19:37] Peter you
[2:19:39] know in that
[2:19:41] moment he realized that what Jesus said
[2:19:43] in John 15 was so true without
[2:19:48] me you can do nothing
[2:19:51] right here's a man's man but he did not
[2:19:55] mind holding on to
[2:19:58] Jesus Jesus gets him back in the boat
[2:20:01] and he's ready to deal with a storm and
[2:20:03] Peter won't let him
[2:20:06] go just hold
[2:20:08] me that's where we are we need to hold
[2:20:13] him while he's holding us it's important
[2:20:17] that it works both ways if you hold on
[2:20:21] to him you can know that he's holding on
[2:20:23] to you abiding if you abide in me and my
[2:20:26] words abide in you let's stand it's
[2:20:31] relationship but it's
[2:20:33] also
[2:20:39] Fellowship you can't
[2:20:42] be
[2:20:44] intimate with a
[2:20:47] page but you can draw strength from the
[2:20:51] presence of a
[2:20:54] person Jesus Christ he's more than the
[2:20:57] written record of who he is it's not
[2:21:01] just the written word it's not just the
[2:21:03] printed word it's not just the recorded
[2:21:06] word that this bride has to hold to in
[2:21:08] this hour it's the Living Word it's the
[2:21:11] one who lives in us it's the one who has
[2:21:15] skin when he needs to have
[2:21:18] skin but he's the one abide in in a so
[2:21:21] present everpresent help in the time of
[2:21:25] need if you turn loose of him remember
[2:21:29] you're going to eventually get the
[2:21:30] disconnected feeling doesn't mean he's
[2:21:33] let you
[2:21:34] go it means he's trying to make you
[2:21:36] aware of where you are all you have to
[2:21:39] do is call him don't let me go Jesus
[2:21:43] don't let me go Jesus don't let me go
