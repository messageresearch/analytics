TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hello i'm pastor steven shelley and i want to welcome you to this edition of the eagles cry we're just delighted to be able to come to you today wherever you are around the world from our little sanctuary in smith station alabama usa i'm the pastor of the new hope revival ministries and the host of the eagles cry and we're just thankful to god for giving us the opportunity to be able to share with you some of the things that the holy spirit is laid on our heart things that i believe i hope and trust will be an encouragement to you perhaps the lord will use this program to cause you to dig a little deeper into the storehouse of god's word the treasures that have been hidden in darkness god wants us to be able to find those treasures in this hour and to prepare ourselves to move forward into the final chapters of god's plan for planet earth as we know it yes i believe that we are nearing the coming of the lord the consummation of the ages the end of all things i truly believe that we are plunging toward the millennial reign of the lord jesus christ and before that happens the earth is yet to do some more reeling and rocking there are many birth pains that are mentioned in matthew chapter 24 and luke chapter 21 where our lord jesus speaks about the kinds of events that will be taking place on the earth just prior to his coming and to the end of the age many of these things started being fulfilled after immediately after he spoke them and yet many of these things still have a legitimate application and fulfillment in the hour that we're living in and because our lord jesus chose the analogy of a woman giving birth we know that he was telling us in matthew 24 verse 8 when he said all of these things are the beginning of sorrows we know that he was letting us know that there would be a great increase in both frequency and intensity in all of the events that he mentioned preparing us for the end time we will see them increase and we're seeing that and it helps us to know that it's time for the bride of christ to lift up our heads for our redemption draweth nigh and we want to continue our study today we're making our way through a top 10 countdown of biblical events birth pains of the messiah we started at 10 and were counting backward number 10 was signs in the sun and the moon and the stars we've covered that already in prior broadcast and then we move on number nine was violence upon the whole earth and we also have covered number nine number eight famines pestilences and earthquakes then number seven nations in distress with perplexity number six false prophets and false teachers if you're hearing the broadcast for the first time today and you'd like to go back and hear the other broadcasts see the other programs in this series check our website at revival.org perhaps there will be some ordering information there and we also have for a small monthly subscription fee a vod system video on demand where you would be able to log in and see all of the episodes in this series on the birth pangs of the messiah and you would also be able to see some other conference sessions where we have spoken around the world and an archive of our local services here at new hope revival ministries so that you could catch up on this series if today is your first time tuning in number five was an increase in technology in the end time according to the prophecy of the prophet daniel today we want to begin to talk about number four in the countdown and that's nations aligning for prophetic fulfillment i want to read psalm 2 verses 1 through 3. why do the heathen rage the psalmist said and the people imagine a vain thing the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the lord and against his anointed saying let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from us these are prophetic words that describe very accurately what's happening in the nations of the world as we speak there is a realignment that is taking place nations are shifting governments are changing regimes are crumbling new regimes are raising up to take their place it appears that one dictator falls and another dictator rises nations are joining together in leagues uh forming different federations and organizations i'm sure that they're doing it in their own consciousness in their own mind they're doing it to better themselves to better their people and so forth but i want you to know that really it is prophesied that these things would happen in unprecedented ways near the coming of the lord nations would shake we experienced some time back the arab spring and uh that this is the the analytical term that the media has used to examine the shiftings that took place in egypt and many other nations of the world these kinds of shiftings are going on still right at this moment some of them we're more aware of than others but we need to pray as i have shared with you here on the broadcast before we the people of god those who are born again of the spirit of truth we have an obligation and a responsibility to pray for the deliverance and the salvation of the nations of the world i believe god has people in every nation who uh really need to be prayed for need strength because they're kind of holding space in nations many of which are under persecution because they fail to follow the national mandated faith or the national mandated religion christians are being persecuted in many nations of the world right now and we need to pray for their safety we need to pray that god will use them to reach the last seed of god before the end time comes we need to also pray that uh at times i believe prayer can hold back a change of leadership that would clamp down on uh even what little bit of access the gospel has to certain regions and areas of different nations i really believe prayer is the key in this hour and we have not only the responsibility to do it we have the authority to to discover supernaturally the mind of god and pray that we do that prophetically we do that by waiting on the lord by listening for his voice and then praying decreeing declaring prophesying all the things that that we feel the spirit of god saying in this hour so nations are shaking and as the old hymn said nations are shaking israel is awakening one of the alignments that we see going on in the world right now are the nations are joining together in their outcry in their persecution and in their threatenings against israel this was prophesied in the scripture that all nations would would rise against israel that they would encompass that tiny little dot on the map and that they would do everything they could to annihilate well there's one thing we know for sure and that is god has a covenant with the jewish people and with the nation of israel you don't have to like it you don't you don't have to jump on the bandwagon but i'm telling you you won't be able to change it because god has determined to keep his word that's the kind of god we serve i believe god loves people of all ethnicities i believe he wants to bring salvation to the gentile nations i believe that with all my heart but i do believe that god has a special covenant not only with the people of israel the jewish people no matter where they're scattered around the world but i believe god made a covenant with the dirt i believe god made a covenant with the land of israel and he has given that to the jewish people and much to the dismay and the anger of of so many nations who who sometimes enemies you know of each other and yet they come together in their hatred they join together at least for their hatred of the nation of israel and we we see such foolish things going on in the united nations uh against israel and and uh so many uh talk the talk including my nation you know we're going to stand with israel we're going to support israel and and so forth but i'm telling you i don't have a lot of confidence in politics because i see that they can say one thing in fact uh talking out of both sides of their mouth so i pray for israel and that's one of the birth pangs of the messiah that we'll talk about before we close this series so i don't want to spend too much time talking about israel today except to say that this this realigning that's taking place you know some are even prophesying the uh the the resurrection i guess you could say of the holy roman empire or at least a revised version of the roman empire and they do it because of some scriptures in the bible that seem to indicate that rome will play a part in the end time i think to believe that rome that the roman empire will be completely revived politically and have a major role uh politically in the world in the end time i think that's probably an error but i do believe that that uh rome will play a part in that system but it's more of a religious system than it is a political system by the time that the religious system and the political system will join together it's going to be uh well it's like we use the expression in the states sometime then it's kind of katy bar the door uh by the time those two systems come together as prophesied in the book of revelation the antichrist is going to be that false messiah is going to be in full swing and the mark of the beast that we read about in the book of revelation is going to be taking hold then and so there is uh there is definitely going to be some some shiftings that will accelerate in the nation's alignments and realignments getting us ready for a time that uh that the antichrist will rule from the city that sets on seven hills according to the scripture i'll leave you to do your research to find out what that's all about we'll talk about it in a later broadcast for sure nations aligning for prophetic fulfillment is number four in our list of the birth pains of messiah some of this we can find in in so many places throughout the older testament and the new testament as well where it talks about the kings of the east which generally refer to china in ezekiel 38 and 39 we hear about the armies of gog and magog and we we we just there's just a lot that's going to happen uh with the nations of the world as we draw near to the coming of the lord so we watch we watch the news we read the newspaper and we see these things unfolding it's hard to know everything that's going to happen uh but the one thing we need to know is god is watching all of this he is you know nothing is going to happen in the world that's going to catch god by surprise he never has that aha moment i i didn't see that one coming that never happens to god he is omniscient he has all knowledge and he knows the end from the beginning and everything in between so if you have committed your life to him if you are anchored in the rock of ages then no matter what happens around you the nation shaking the heathen raging um the threats of of nuclear warfare whatever it might be there is a place of safety in our relationship with the lord jesus christ and i believe that i'm preaching that because i believe it there's no better place no safer place to be than in the messiah and we come into the messiah when we acknowledge our sin and our unrighteousness and we repent and we claim lay our claim to god's righteousness when we hold on to him and say i'm filthy i'm unworthy i'm undone without you but with you i am complete and truly we are complete with the lord jesus christ number three what the third uh birth pain of the messiah that's mentioned in scripture uh or at least the third category is apostasy and this apostasy will eventually swing into a one world church system forming uh it it has its roots today in in an ecumenical push to blur the lines between different faiths um merging them together for the sake of tolerance at least that's what they say but really there's an agenda that is a whole lot deeper than what we we're hearing about it's not just for the sake of unity and peace it's actually for the sake of introducing the world to the antichrist system that's what we see happening right now there is such compromise in the church world today we uh are in general sin is no longer preached against i i mean let's just be honest because if we preach against sin we're called intolerant and hate hate mongers if we preach against sin because people have a difficulty differentiating between sin and the sinner we need to do that it's the body of christ we love the sinner but we've got to hate the sin if god hates it we have to hate it and for the sake of crowds and for the sake of finances the church at large has compromised on the preaching of the gospel which has caused us to be in the condition we're in right now which are which i would call the advanced stages of an apostasy that started many many years ago thank god the word has been restored to the bride of christ everything that was lost in the dark ages there has been a progression of revelation starting at martin luther with uh with the message of justification moving into uh the leadership of john wesley with the message of sanctification developing further into the pentecostal time period the pentecostal age where the gifts of the spirit were restored the baptism of the holy ghost and even glossolalia the the the manifestation of speaking in another tongue god has restored his word for the bride from the dark ages and so the bride is hearing the word and is growing in the in the revelation of jesus christ all over the world that deep calling to the deep that we often mention on this broadcast but the church world the denominational world the religious world in so many cases seems to continue to to uh slip down that slope uh into apostasy uh we've compromised with sin the old old-timers in the old pentecostal church used to say we've compromised with sin we've let down the bars we've compromised with sin the sheep got out and the goats got in and really that's where we are the world is getting churchy and the church has gotten worldly there's been a whole reversal of roles and uh so it's very very sad it's it's a sad condition but it was a necessary condition in some regard because it will take that uh that uh preaching of tolerance that ecumenical mindset it will take that kind of an ideology to plunge the world into a one world religion which again will be headquartered in the city that sits on seven hills according to the scripture and i don't believe it's referring to denver colorado by the way i believe the scripture's clear when it talks about this system this is not people but it's the system the system that is drunk this whoreish system mentioned in the book of revelation that's drunk on the blood of the martyrs 68 plus million people killed by the church system that church system continues to develop a mystery babylon continues to march on until the world is swung into a one-world religion and the antichrist that that charismatic you know perhaps good-looking guy will step on the scene to lead the world into peace quote unquote but uh the bride will never be deceived by that kind of stuff our eyes are on jesus we're not looking for another messiah we're not looking for another savior we are only looking for the return of the one who saved us in the beginning the one true and only messiah the lord jesus christ so no matter what the church does no matter how she compromises no matter how eventually a one world religion is formed god's going to have what he has always had in every age a true remnant a bride that will stay true to the word even if it costs her her life and that's how serious this thing is going to eventually get in the time of the great wrath there's a lot of studying that we can do in revelation chapter 13 verse 17 in revelation chapter 17 it talks about a lot of this antichrist one world religion mystery babylon uh stuff that we can talk about at in another broadcast but i wanted to mention that as the third category of the birth pains of messiah we see this advancing along in the name of unity in the name of tolerance but it's really a plot of the enemy uh again that god is fully aware of to take the world into a one church system number two uh goes hand in hand with number three number two is the formation of a one world government and a one world economy uh we're counting backwards because we're building up in intensity and and i think this number two uh for the birth pains of the messiah we're going to see some uh tremendous things i say tremendous not because they're going to be wonderful but they're going to be hard to believe we're going to see some hard to believe things unfold in the next few months and and few short years that will tremendous strides will be made will be accomplished in taking the world into a one world government eventually that one world church union and that one world government union will join they will come together uh for that for that real impact of the antichrist on the earth this is a very serious thing to look at we have organizations in place federations of nations in place right now that are preparing the way um i don't say that they're the the final chapter but or or the final version of what will be but they're preparing the way for a time that nations will come together uh one one government will rule the world and one economy one economic system one monetary system uh to control the world somebody says this just sounds outlandish well if you look back over the past 10 years things have happened in our world that we never dreamed could happen unless we were looking at the scripture and today we're looking at the scriptures and we see that that it is possible it is happening and we can expect again the growth of frequency and intensity in the strides that are going to be made to bring the world into a one world society or as some have called it a new world order some of the things they hope to accomplish sound amazing sound wonderful but i'm telling you it's just another step in in in selling out to the antichrist so we want to remain true to the word of god we want to see our relationship with the messiah grow deeper in in intensity we want to just give more of ourselves to him and be more yielded so that we can be used in the end time uh i do not believe that the that the bride of jesus christ which is made up of both jew and gentile being prepared in this hour i do not believe that that we will see the great wrath but i believe we will see tribulation in fact many are seeing tribulation right now so to say that we're going to be caught out of fear before any hardship falls on the earth well we're too late for that already uh because there's a lot of hardship the united states of america is not immune to the things that are going to be transpiring on the planet so there's not going to be a geographical safety zone but there is going to be a spiritual safety zone and again that's in a loving relationship with the lord jesus christ we've got the eu we've got the u.n we've got many many many other units coming together and they seem to be doing such an amazing job some seem to think so anyway some evaluate it to be such an amazing job but again really it is nothing but prophecy coming to pass to let us know that we are nearing the coming of the lord perhaps you need the lord to encourage you in this hour so that you are not paralyzed by fear i want to pray today the bible said that perfect love casteth out fear god does not want you paralyzed by fear he wants you trusting in his word the same scriptures the same scripture that tells us about the things tragic events that are going to befall the earth the same scripture tells us that there is a safety place in trusting the king of kings and the lord of lords i want to pray that god will help you in this hour to trust him more father thank you for this opportunity to speak a few words of truth to drop out some nuggets hopefully that will cause folk to dig a little deeper in the word and i'm asking right now that you will speak to people's lives draw them into a closer relationship with you we we can't just make up our mind to draw close to you it has to be that you're drawing us and then we respond to that draw so lord i'm asking you to draw your people those who who i have an opportunity to minister to and and those who this program would never reach i'm not just concerned about the viewers of this program i'm concerned about those folks that are yours all over the world we need revival we need a stirring in our hearts we need healing in our bodies we just want to put our hope and our confidence and our trust in you bless now your people i pray in the name of yeshua our messiah the lord jesus christ thank you for watching the eagles cry tune in again next week for another edition send your prayer request we'd be happy to pray with you uh join our faith with yours and believe and remember no matter what you see or hear on the news jesus is still lord of all thank you for watching bye bye for now you
