[0:58] hello there I'm Pastor Steven Shelley of

[2:05] we believe that God is using it for his
[2:08] purposes but we believe that he's going
[2:10] to use it even in greater ways in the
[2:13] future and so the fine folk at the
[2:17] gospel channel they need your prayer
[2:18] support and your faithful giving we
[2:21] don't ever want there to be a time that
[2:23] you would come looking for us and not be
[2:26] able to find us and we are grateful for
[2:29] the opportunity that they give us to
[2:31] partner with them and help bring you
[2:33] this programming we are starting today
[2:36] episode eight in a series of teachings
[2:40] that we have entitled in the fullness of
[2:43] time let me mention again that if you

[3:48] moments last night we were watching it

[4:44] connected to you I can't tell you that
[4:48] it's always easy to sit in this chair
[4:50] but when we start and when the anointing
[4:53] of God begins to flow it's almost like
[4:56] at times I can feel you on the other end
[4:58] and what a great blessing that is to any
[5:01] preacher in whatever setting he's
[5:04] preaching in whether it's in the local
[5:06] church on Sunday or radio or television
[5:09] it's always a very encouraging feeling
[5:12] to feel someone who's pulling who's
[5:15] interested in hearing what the Lord is
[5:18] you to share so I'm believing that we
[5:21] will conclude our series today with
[5:24] episode 8 in the fullness of time we
[5:28] have been studying it now week after
[5:30] week we've covered a lot of scriptures
[5:33] and we've covered a lot of ground but
[5:36] our foundational scripture for the
[5:38] entire series is found in Galatians
[5:40] chapter 4 verses 1 through 7 and I'm not
[5:44] going to break tradition I'm gonna read
[5:46] it again now I say that the air as long
[5:50] as he is a child differeth nothing from
[5:53] a servant though he be Lord of all but
[5:57] is under tutors and governors until the
[6:00] time appointed of the Father even so we
[6:04] when we were children were in bondage
[6:07] under the elements of the world but when
[6:10] the fullness of the time was come God
[6:14] sent forth his son made of a woman made
[6:19] under the law to redeem them that were
[6:23] under the law that we might receive the
[6:26] adoption of sons and because ye are sons
[6:31] God hath sent forth the spirit of his
[6:35] son into your hearts crying Abba Father
[6:40] wherefore thou art no more a servant but
[6:44] a son and if a son then an heir of God
[6:49] through Christ I tell you that is a
[6:53] power-packed seven verses of scripture
[6:56] and we've covered them even the last
[6:59] time we were together we broke them down
[7:01] a little bit more using the original
[7:04] language of Greek when we were together
[7:07] the last time we emphasized three main
[7:11] points and that was that God was waiting
[7:16] for a particular time when the scene was
[7:20] set and everything was just right so
[7:24] that he could step into this world
[7:26] through a
[7:28] the Word of God made flesh we talked
[7:32] about how that there had never been a
[7:35] time since the beginning since the
[7:38] garden that the world was more prepared
[7:41] more ready to receive the Lord Jesus
[7:45] Christ than in the hour that he was born
[7:48] it was in that moment that time had come
[7:51] to its fullness we talked about that
[7:54] vessel remember that was being filled up
[7:57] all through the years as a new prophet
[8:01] would come on the scene with the word of
[8:03] the Lord as God would would move among
[8:07] his people in various ways and there
[8:11] would be various responses it seems that
[8:15] most of the Old Testament was God wooing
[8:18] and calling his people back to be
[8:21] faithful to the Covenant that he had
[8:24] made with them there's one thing we know
[8:26] about God and that is he is always
[8:29] faithful to his end of the Covenant but
[8:33] he continues to have to draw us and woe
[8:36] us and call us back into covenant with
[8:39] him until we understand what a privilege
[8:44] what a blessing it is to be included in
[8:47] God's covenant with mankind then we
[8:51] desire to walk humbly to walk in
[8:53] repentance and to walk in obedience
[8:55] before him so those three main areas
[8:59] that we can say that the world was
[9:03] prepared in number one the world was
[9:06] ready for him physically we covered that
[9:10] with the road system with the shipping
[9:12] routes everything in place so that when
[9:15] the gospel came it could then get out
[9:18] number two the world was ready for him
[9:22] religiously paganism idolatry was on
[9:26] every hand and religion the true faith
[9:30] that God had given to the Hebrew people
[9:32] even it had
[9:34] in greatly polluted the the character of
[9:38] the priesthood had been compromised and
[9:40] the various sects of Judaism like like
[9:44] the Pharisees and the Sadducees and a
[9:46] few others were all moving into their
[9:49] little interpretations which in most
[9:52] cases left the people either hopeless or
[9:56] bowed down by the weight of legalism and
[10:01] so I tell you the world needed a savior
[10:05] in that hour and then the other way that
[10:08] we can say that the world was totally
[10:11] ready for the coming of the son our
[10:14] Messiah our Savior was it was ready
[10:17] prophetically and that's kind of how we
[10:20] ended our time together last week we
[10:23] were talking about God's choice for a
[10:26] place for this precious gift to be born
[10:30] in that little humble town of Bethlehem
[10:34] as prophesied by the prophet Micah in
[10:37] chapter 5 verse 2 we talked about the
[10:41] announcement how it was made not not to
[10:45] world leaders to the movers and shakers
[10:48] of that time but rather to the most
[10:52] humble of all those Shepherds that were
[10:56] tending the flock out in the field and
[11:00] it was to them that God announced this
[11:03] great deliverer this great gift and and
[11:08] why did God choose this humble place and
[11:12] these humble people well I believe one
[11:15] of the reasons is he knew they would get
[11:17] the word out and the scripture tells us
[11:20] we read it when we were together last
[11:22] Luke chapter 2 verses 8 through 20 it
[11:25] talks about just that they went
[11:28] everywhere sharing the good news that
[11:31] the angel of the Lord and the heavenly
[11:33] host had delivered to them the savior
[11:36] has come oh my what a joyous event that
[11:41] was we are so grateful to be able to
[11:46] and this whole plan of both
[11:50] condescension God coming down to live
[11:54] humbling himself to live among man and
[11:57] also the Incarnation which is the the
[12:02] Word of God being transformed into a
[12:06] body of flesh
[12:09] a man who would experience the same
[12:12] emotions and the same feelings that you
[12:16] and I other men and other women would
[12:18] also experience we know because of God's
[12:23] plan he chose it this way he could have
[12:26] come in any form he could have had a
[12:29] plan of salvation that looked very
[12:32] differently than the one that we now
[12:35] know to be the way but he chose this way
[12:38] and every detail of it he chose for a
[12:43] reason for a particular purpose and to
[12:47] speak a particular message I love that
[12:51] about our God he is meticulous in detail
[12:55] he never misses anything he cannot lie
[12:59] he does not contradict himself and
[13:03] prophetically he prepares the hearts of
[13:06] men and women long before he does
[13:09] something among them and we can say that
[13:12] our hearts are being prepared have been
[13:15] prepared to prophetically of what we
[13:19] will see in fact what we are seeing
[13:22] unfolding in both the world at large and
[13:25] also in the body of Christ so we are not
[13:29] just ignorant people bumping around in
[13:31] the darkness trying to figure out what's
[13:33] going on but the very hour that we're
[13:36] living in has been foretold it has been
[13:38] prophesied the good the bad and the ugly
[13:41] and so we don't have to be afraid we
[13:45] don't have to be fearful this is one of
[13:47] the messages that Jesus delivered the
[13:50] most in his earthly recorded ministry
[13:53] don't fear don't be afraid be not afraid
[13:58] it is high and
[14:00] I believe he did that because he knew
[14:02] that that one of our most common
[14:04] reactions as humans is to be fearful the
[14:08] Bible tells us that perfect love his
[14:12] perfect love casteth out fear fear
[14:16] brings torment but peace is brought to
[14:21] our lives with a relationship with Jesus
[14:25] Christ and his peace and his love
[14:28] banishes fear I thought we would read
[14:32] John 1 again hopefully I can do it in
[14:36] such a way that I won't have to repeat
[14:39] so much of the commentary but I think
[14:42] it's such beautiful words too to begin
[14:45] to sum up what we've been studying in
[14:49] John 1 verse 1 in the beginning was the
[14:53] word and the word was with god and the
[14:57] word and and the Word was God the Word
[15:03] was with God and the Word was God the
[15:08] same was in the beginning with God all
[15:11] things were made by him and without him
[15:15] was not anything made that was made
[15:19] in him was life and the life was the
[15:24] light of men and the light shyness in
[15:28] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[15:31] it not there was a man sent from God
[15:36] whose name was John the same came for a
[15:40] witness to bear witness of the light
[15:43] that all men through him might believe
[15:48] he was not that light but was sent to
[15:52] bear witness of that light that was the
[15:56] true light which lighteth every man that
[15:59] cometh into the world he was in the
[16:02] world this is our Savior he was in the
[16:07] world and the world was made by him and
[16:12] the
[16:13] world knew him not he came unto his own
[16:17] and his own received him not but as many
[16:23] as received him and this remains true
[16:27] today as many as received him to them
[16:31] gave he power to become the sons of God
[16:36] even to them that believe on his name
[16:41] hallelujah which were born verse 13 not
[16:45] of blood nor of the will of the flesh
[16:48] nor of the will of man but of God that's
[16:52] God's sons they're not born by the will
[16:56] of the flesh or by the will of man but
[16:57] by the will of God and verse 14 really
[17:04] pulls together the first couple of
[17:07] verses of John one and the word was made
[17:10] flesh we already know that the word was
[17:13] from the beginning that the Word was
[17:16] with God that the Word was God
[17:19] and now we know that the Word was made
[17:22] flesh that is the Incarnation and dwelt
[17:27] among us and we beheld his glory the
[17:30] glory as of the only begotten of the
[17:33] Father full of grace and truth
[17:37] what a beautiful demonstration of the
[17:41] word the word has now taken on a fleshly
[17:47] body verse 15 John bare witness of him
[17:50] and cried saying this was he of whom I
[17:53] spake he that cometh after me is
[17:56] preferred before me for he was before me
[17:59] and of his fullness have all we received
[18:04] and grace for grace for the law was
[18:09] given by Moses but grace and truth came
[18:13] by Jesus Christ what wonderful words 17
[18:21] verses of beautiful truth that have
[18:25] direct
[18:26] Packt on my life on your life as a real
[18:31] believer in Jesus Christ what grace and
[18:36] what a gift he is to us here is a couple
[18:40] of other portions of Scripture that I
[18:42] think are so important in in grasping
[18:47] and also in rejoicing in the beauty of
[18:50] the Incarnation Philippians chapter 2
[18:53] verse 7 and 8 but made himself this is
[18:57] our Messiah but made himself of no
[19:01] reputation and took upon him the form of
[19:06] a servant and was made in the likeness
[19:09] of men and being found in fashion as a
[19:14] man he humbled himself and became
[19:18] obedient unto death even the death of
[19:22] the Cross he humbled himself as God who
[19:29] had become man as God who had been made
[19:32] flesh it was necessary even though this
[19:37] was the greatest condescension what an
[19:40] act of humility that God the creator of
[19:43] all things would come down and live as a
[19:45] man but now that he has chosen to live
[19:49] to be manifested as a man in a body of
[19:53] flesh his lesson continues he has to
[19:57] continue to learn the path of humility
[20:00] he has to Humble himself so that he can
[20:05] become obedient unto death even to the
[20:08] death of the Cross for us that we could
[20:13] be saved
[20:14] remember in Gethsemane this place of the
[20:18] press the Olive Press when our Lord was
[20:22] being pressed because there was a spirit
[20:25] life in him that had to be made
[20:28] available to you and I and in that
[20:31] suffering moment he prayed that prayer
[20:34] if at all possible
[20:36] this is more
[20:38] another demonstration of him having to
[20:41] continuously humble himself and bring
[20:45] his body into subjection obedient unto
[20:49] death that's what we see if it all
[20:53] possible let this cup pass from me
[20:55] nevertheless not my will but your will
[20:59] be done you know friend if our Lord
[21:02] Jesus Christ had to pray such a prayer
[21:05] if he had to continue to learn obedience
[21:08] by suffering in life how much more must
[21:11] you and I also learned to bring
[21:14] ourselves into that place of humility
[21:17] before God that we would seek his will
[21:20] even above our own will above our own
[21:23] way I want to share another portion of
[21:26] Scripture with you in fact I'm gonna
[21:27] load you down with Bible verses today
[21:30] and as we mentioned last week I hope
[21:33] you'll do your homework I hope you'll
[21:35] look them up in your own Bible and ask
[21:38] the Lord to make them even more real to
[21:40] you and your private devotion Ephesians
[21:43] chapter 1 verses 3 through 12 blessed be
[21:48] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[21:50] Christ who hath blessed us with all
[21:53] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[21:56] in Christ according as he hath chosen us
[22:00] in him before the foundation of the
[22:05] world that we should be holy and without
[22:08] blame before him in love this is only
[22:13] possible because of the grace of God in
[22:16] our lives
[22:17] verse 5 having predestinated us unto the
[22:22] adoption of children what we've been
[22:24] speaking about by Jesus Christ to
[22:28] himself according to the good pleasure
[22:31] of his will to the praise of the glory
[22:35] of His grace wherein he hath made us
[22:40] accepted in the beloved
[22:44] we have been made accepted because of
[22:49] the blood
[22:50] that covers our lives not because we
[22:54] always get it right we we strive
[22:56] remember we talked about the bow and the
[22:59] arrow and and we make every effort to
[23:02] strike the target in the bull's eye
[23:05] but sometimes we miss the center and our
[23:09] arrow veers a little to the right or the
[23:12] left but we must always try to get it
[23:15] right but in those times that we don't
[23:18] get it right
[23:19] we can't throw up our hands and quit and
[23:21] say what's the use we must remember that
[23:24] it is not by our always getting it right
[23:27] that we're saved it is by His grace it
[23:32] is by his death the provision of his
[23:36] blood that we're saved not of our good
[23:39] works lest we would have reason to boast
[23:41] in the flesh but because it is the gift
[23:44] of God and he has made us accepted he
[23:49] has made us acceptable in the beloved
[23:53] verse 7 in whom we have redemption
[23:57] remember we talked about what this
[24:00] redemption is to bring us all the way
[24:03] back when we get off and most of us did
[24:07] in our lives we came into this world
[24:09] very innocent but it didn't take long
[24:12] for us to learn a crooked path did it
[24:14] but it's His grace to redeem us through
[24:19] his blood the forgiveness of sins
[24:22] according to the riches of His grace I'm
[24:26] so glad that His grace never runs out
[24:29] I'm so glad his love never gives up on
[24:32] me verse 8 wherein he hath abounded
[24:36] toward us in all wisdom and prudence
[24:40] having made known unto us the mystery of
[24:43] his will I believe that's part of this
[24:46] study I believe that's part of the
[24:48] reason why you have have tuned in to
[24:51] this program it's because God wants to
[24:54] make known to you personally as an
[24:58] individual the mystery of his
[25:01] concerning your life what all this is
[25:04] about it's not about building bigger
[25:06] churches although we need nice
[25:08] facilities to gather all the people in
[25:10] to worship God but it's not about
[25:13] building little kingdoms down here on
[25:15] the earth and and seeing how good we can
[25:17] be and and and you know dying and having
[25:21] a lot of nice things said about us at
[25:23] the end of our life it's about so much
[25:24] more than that it's about his good
[25:28] pleasure toward us his will for our
[25:31] lives being fulfilled by our humbling by
[25:36] humbling ourselves by bringing ourselves
[25:41] into that place of submission it is an
[25:43] act of the will and I tell you you know
[25:47] I made that decision to follow the Lord
[25:48] a long time ago prior to 1975 and yet I
[25:54] still have to bring my will I think I
[25:57] mentioned that recently I I still have
[26:00] to bring my will down I have to grab a
[26:02] hold up and say wait a minute
[26:03] I know what I want I know what I think
[26:06] ought to be done but something tells me
[26:09] God has another plan so I had better
[26:13] submit my will to his will because if I
[26:16] have God's will I will have the very
[26:19] best for my life it will turn out for me
[26:23] to be the very best I know that I've
[26:25] learned that by experience verse 9
[26:28] having made known unto us the mystery of
[26:32] his will according to his good pleasure
[26:34] which he hath purposed in himself that
[26:38] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[26:42] times the very thing we've been studying
[26:45] he might gather together in one all
[26:48] things in Christ both which are in
[26:51] heaven and which are on the earth even
[26:54] in him you and I are a part of that
[26:56] great big gathering together of all
[26:59] things into Christ that is a portion of
[27:04] what's being accomplished in our lives
[27:06] in this hour we're being gathered
[27:09] together
[27:10] in Christ in spirit to be one with
[27:16] Christ in spirit to be one with one
[27:20] another in spirit because we are one
[27:23] with him this was the prayer of our Lord
[27:26] that that you and I might experience a
[27:29] oneness in the same manner that he has
[27:33] experienced and demonstrated oneness
[27:36] with the Father oh praise God for that
[27:39] verse 11 in whom also we have obtained
[27:43] an inheritance I love that you know III
[27:50] III don't know so much about inheritance
[27:53] here in this world I I didn't have any
[27:56] rich uncles and I received an
[27:59] inheritance from my grandmother when she
[28:01] passed away and and pretty much saddled
[28:04] that's it that'll be it
[28:06] but I have an inheritance it doesn't
[28:10] take long to go through the natural
[28:11] inheritance does it there's always
[28:14] something you want to buy but we have an
[28:17] inheritance hallelujah that it's not
[28:20] temporal it's it's not cash to spend at
[28:25] the mall it's so much more than that
[28:28] it's eternal life but it's even more
[28:30] than that it's victory it's victory that
[28:34] we can tap into in our everyday life in
[28:38] whom also we have obtained an
[28:40] inheritance how being predestinated
[28:43] according to the purpose of him who
[28:46] worketh all things after the counsel of
[28:50] his own will he does he does he's
[28:55] working all things out according to the
[28:57] counsel of his own will verse 12 that we
[29:00] should be to the praise of his glory who
[29:05] first trusted in Christ that we should
[29:09] be to the praise we become praise to his
[29:14] glory praise is not just what we do
[29:18] praises who we become because if our
[29:21] life is
[29:24] ever-increasingly submitted to him then
[29:29] he receives reward he receives reward he
[29:36] receives glory by our life because our
[29:40] life then becomes a reflection of his
[29:44] grace and his love when those beautiful
[29:48] people so many years ago some of them
[29:51] from the UK others from Saxony in
[29:55] different places in Europe made up their
[29:58] mind in a place called herrnhut under
[30:03] the leadership of Count Zinzendorf we're
[30:08] going to go to the Isles we're going to
[30:12] sell ourselves into slavery we're going
[30:16] to work in the sugar cane fields of the
[30:19] tropics of the Caribbean and we're going
[30:24] to be witness and salvation we're going
[30:28] to be light to many of those slaves some
[30:32] of which who had been taken from Africa
[30:35] some of them sold into slavery in the
[30:39] Caribbean and some swam ashore after
[30:43] shipwreck and then became slaves here
[30:47] were white faced men who sold themselves
[30:52] into indentured servitude slavery so
[30:56] that they might work in the same fields
[30:58] as many of those others slaves who had
[31:02] been stolen from their land from their
[31:05] home because they wanted them to know
[31:09] that even though you're living in in
[31:12] bondage in the natural you don't have to
[31:16] be slaves in the spirit you can be free
[31:20] on the inside no matter what's going on
[31:23] in your life on the outside and when
[31:26] they were questioned why would you do
[31:29] such a thing leave everything behind
[31:32] some of them had had
[31:35] and some of them even had wealth why
[31:39] would you sell that why would you give
[31:41] that all away and sell yourself into
[31:44] slavery to be a light to men that you
[31:47] don't even know their reply so famously
[31:50] recorded was that the Lamb may receive
[31:55] the reward of his suffering you and I
[32:00] become as the scripture said that we
[32:04] should be to the praise of his glory
[32:08] that the Lamb may receive the reward for
[32:13] his suffering I want you to know there
[32:16] is no way to describe the the amount the
[32:21] degree of pain and agony and suffering
[32:24] that our Lord went through willingly
[32:28] willingly for you and I as part of the
[32:33] great plan of redemption yes we talked
[32:37] about his flesh his body rejected the
[32:42] idea he struggled in that realm but he
[32:46] said nevertheless not my will but your
[32:52] will be done what a price paid for me
[32:56] what a gift given to both myself and to
[33:00] you and to so many others and the least
[33:04] that I can do is live a life that will
[33:08] somehow somehow glorify God and bring
[33:13] praise to his name to say to the world
[33:17] it's worth it to serve the Living God I
[33:20] want you to know friend it is worth it
[33:23] all Christians real Christians real
[33:27] believers have problems yes we do but
[33:30] we're not alone
[33:31] we have someone going with us walking
[33:36] with us talking with us you can pour out
[33:39] your heart to him right there in your
[33:41] flat where you're living right now you
[33:44] can just pour your heart out
[33:45] to him and he here's somebody said well
[33:48] I don't feel any different this is not
[33:50] always about feelings
[33:51] it's always about faith sometimes thank
[33:55] God we can feel the witness the Bible
[33:58] said we will know we're saved by the
[34:00] coming alive by the quickening in our
[34:04] spirit or of our spirit but we don't
[34:07] always have the feeling the sensation is
[34:10] not always there but faith becomes an
[34:13] anchor to the soul and remember at the
[34:17] end of the day no if we chose we would
[34:20] always choose the easy life we would
[34:22] choose for everything to be to be
[34:25] beautiful to be good to feel good to
[34:28] look good this is what we would choose
[34:31] for ourselves but at the end of the day
[34:33] we want to live a life that the lamb may
[34:38] receive the reward of his suffering that
[34:41] we can point the way for others that
[34:45] they can find the same inheritance
[34:47] that's coming to you and I God has a
[34:51] plan that's what we've been what we've
[34:53] been talking about week after week now
[34:56] God has a plan he hasn't abandoned his
[35:01] plan there is no plan B this is the plan
[35:06] for the salvation of those who can
[35:09] recognize the call of God in their life
[35:13] I want to make a list with you I want
[35:16] you to adjust these verses down if you
[35:20] possibly can because I'm not going to
[35:22] read the verse I'm just going to give
[35:25] you the address and and maybe they'll be
[35:28] able to share it with you there if not
[35:31] then hopefully we could get it on
[35:33] YouTube for you to read here are some
[35:37] beautiful points that have been laid up
[35:39] for us that we can see again the great
[35:44] work again it could have come anyway he
[35:49] could have chosen an easy way to bring
[35:51] you and I in to reconciliation and into
[35:56] fellowship with him but he didn't you
[35:58] the easy way he chose a hard way a
[36:01] painful way a difficult way but he chose
[36:05] that because he wanted to give us a full
[36:10] picture if it would have been easy then
[36:12] the then the price you know wouldn't
[36:15] have been so great and that that would
[36:17] have really indicated that we have such
[36:20] little value but God loved you so much
[36:23] and he considered you such a treasure he
[36:27] considered you so valuable that he chose
[36:31] a plan to redeem you that would be the
[36:34] cost list of all acquisitions what a
[36:39] costly way he chose listen to this list
[36:45] he descended he came down that we might
[36:52] ascend John 6:38 John 14:3
[37:01] he became poor so that we might become
[37:07] rich
[37:08] second Corinthians 8 verse 9 James
[37:13] chapter 2 verse 5 he was born into the
[37:19] world that we might be born again of the
[37:24] Spirit john 1:14 john 3 verse 2 and
[37:32] verse 7 he became a servant he was a son
[37:38] but he became a servant so that we might
[37:43] become sons Philippians chapter 2 verse
[37:49] 7 Galatians you should know this chapter
[37:53] 4 verses 6 & 7 he left his home he came
[38:00] here with no home that we might have an
[38:04] eternal home remember when Jesus said
[38:08] the son of man
[38:09] half no place to lay his head Matthew
[38:12] chapter 8 verse 20 and John chapter 14
[38:18] verse 2 he was hungry so that we might
[38:23] be fed he became the Living bread that
[38:28] we can feed on and yet the God of all
[38:33] eternity became a man and experienced
[38:37] all of the emotion all of the temptation
[38:42] and all of the feelings of a man he even
[38:45] became hungry so that he might become
[38:47] our food and that we might be fed
[38:50] Matthew chapter 4 verse 2 and John
[38:55] chapter 6 verse 50 in his death he
[39:00] became thirsty that that we might become
[39:05] satisfied by drinking the living water
[39:10] that flows forth from the Lord remember
[39:14] in his death he was thirsty they didn't
[39:18] give him water
[39:18] they gave him bitter gall
[39:22] they gave him vinegar for his thirst no
[39:26] mercy and yet he said to the woman at
[39:30] the well if you drink this water John
[39:33] for you're going to be thirsty again but
[39:36] I have water for you to drink and if you
[39:40] drink that water you will never ever be
[39:43] thirsty again read John 19 verse 26 he
[39:49] was stripped naked so that he might
[39:54] become for us our clothing our clothes
[39:58] of righteousness we can be clothed
[40:02] because he was made naked Matthew
[40:06] chapter 27 verse 28 Galatians chapter 3
[40:12] verse 27 he was forsaken that we might
[40:17] not ever have to be forsaken thank God
[40:22] Matthew 27 verse 26 and Matthew 28 verse
[40:28] 20 everything about his life everything
[40:33] about his death everything about his
[40:36] resurrection speaks it preaches to us it
[40:40] speaks to us of what he has made
[40:44] available for us the gift of his life he
[40:49] was sad he was broken that we might
[40:53] become glad that we might have a
[40:55] gladness that's more it's not just based
[40:59] on circumstance it's based on the real
[41:03] joy of the Lord I say a 53 verse 3 and
[41:08] Philippians chapter 4 verse 4 he was
[41:13] bound so that you and I who are bound
[41:17] might be set free Matthew chapter 27 and
[41:23] verse 2 John chapter 8 verses 32 through
[41:29] 36 he was made sin made sin the
[41:35] Scriptures clear that we might be made
[41:39] righteousness he who knew no sin he who
[41:43] was guilty of no sin yet he was made sin
[41:47] so that you and I who are barely capable
[41:51] of any righteousness in our own at all
[41:54] in fact the scripture said all of our
[41:56] righteousness is just like filthy rags
[41:58] but he became sin was made sin so that
[42:03] you and I might be made righteous made
[42:07] acceptable 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 and
[42:11] verse 21 he died ultimately that we
[42:16] might live and never have to die I know
[42:20] there's a physical death to this body
[42:22] but to the believer we're just changing
[42:25] clothes we're just stepping out of one
[42:28] realm into another realm I do not
[42:31] believe the grave is the end
[42:34] John chapter 5 verses 24 and 25 and then
[42:40] the last one in this list he came down
[42:44] we talked about the fact that he
[42:46] descended that we might have sinned but
[42:48] he came down that we might be caught up
[42:51] there is a revelation of truth that says
[42:57] he is coming again and we're going to be
[43:01] caught up to meet him in the air and I
[43:04] believe that with all my heart
[43:06] 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 verses 16
[43:11] and 17 what to understand these verses
[43:17] of Scripture to understand the totality
[43:21] of what our Lord Jesus Yeshua our
[43:25] Messiah has accomplished on our behalf
[43:28] we have to go back some time to the Old
[43:31] Testament we have to look at the
[43:33] sacrificial system that the offering
[43:35] system and what was required to to
[43:39] temporarily cover sin hide sin and Jesus
[43:44] came for a much higher purpose didn't he
[43:47] he didn't just cover our sin but he
[43:50] remitted it he so ultimately has
[43:54] reconciled us to God that in the heart
[43:57] of God in the mind of God there is no
[44:00] record there is no memory of our sin so
[44:05] I enjoyed the book of Hebrews I have to
[44:07] be honest I loved the book of Hebrews
[44:10] because it so beautifully takes the
[44:14] requirements of the older covenant and
[44:17] shows us how Yeshua Jesus Christ came to
[44:24] fulfill every detail every detail of
[44:29] that law so that you and I born under
[44:32] that law could be redeemed and
[44:34] ultimately reconciled to God so I love
[44:37] these verses and in closing out this
[44:40] series I'm going to share these with you
[44:42] again as well Hebrews chapter 9 verse 11
[44:47] and 12
[44:48] this but Christ that word Christ the
[44:53] Anointed One the creoles The Anointed
[44:57] One of God became an High Priest of good
[45:02] things to come by a greater and more
[45:05] perfect Tabernacle not made with hands
[45:08] that is to say not of this building
[45:11] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[45:14] but by his own blood he entered in once
[45:20] just think about it
[45:22] I got putting a finger there just think
[45:25] about it the priest daily offering blood
[45:30] offerings in the tabernacle and later in
[45:33] the temple every day covering different
[45:37] aspects of man's transgression now we
[45:41] know it was once a year on the day of
[45:43] atonement that the high priest would go
[45:46] in into the Holy of Holies and sprinkle
[45:49] blood but every day they were offering
[45:53] those offerings those blood offerings in
[45:56] the outer Court of the tabernacle to
[45:59] make a covering for man's sin and they
[46:03] did it continuously but by his own blood
[46:06] Hebrews 9:12 he entered into the holy
[46:09] place having obtained eternal redemption
[46:14] for us how many times he only had to do
[46:17] at one time his blood was sufficient it
[46:23] did what all the blood of all of those
[46:26] other animals offered unto God could not
[46:28] do his precious blood it satisfied and
[46:33] finished this great work and I love the
[46:36] way that the Apostle shares that with us
[46:40] having obtained eternal redemption for
[46:44] us all and then I like Hebrews 9 23
[46:49] through 26 every bit of this at the
[46:53] right time in the right manner
[46:55] everything set up time had come to its
[46:59] fullness for God
[47:02] demonstrate this kind of love and this
[47:04] gif to Planet Earth and here we are two
[47:07] thousand years later very much made
[47:10] partakers we are very blessed to be
[47:13] partakers of this same gift even now it
[47:17] was therefore necessary
[47:19] 9:23 of Hebrews it was therefore
[47:22] necessary that the patterns of things in
[47:26] the heavens should be purified with
[47:29] these but the heavenly things themselves
[47:32] with better sacrifices than these
[47:35] remember when the Mishkan in the
[47:37] wilderness when the Tabernacle in the
[47:39] wilderness was being made
[47:40] Moses was caught up by God by the spirit
[47:44] into heaven and he was shown the pattern
[47:46] of things before the very throne he came
[47:49] back to the earth after having had this
[47:53] experience and he wanted under the
[47:57] instruction of God to build a replica in
[48:00] the earth and that's what we have in the
[48:03] order of the tabernacle a replica of the
[48:06] throne room of God but the real altar
[48:09] and the real Ark and the real sea of
[48:13] glass etc holy Laver is the one in
[48:17] heaven what we had on the earth was it
[48:20] was simple form wasn't it but it is a
[48:23] type it is a it is a symbol of what it
[48:27] is what really is before the throne and
[48:31] so what was happening on the earth the
[48:34] priests were were operating in this form
[48:37] of worship and giving and offering and
[48:39] and the table of showbread and cleansing
[48:42] in the Laver
[48:43] and lighting of the holy menorah and all
[48:46] of these things but really it was just
[48:49] pointing to the real sacrifice that
[48:52] would one day take place in the
[48:53] heavenlies and let me read on effect let
[48:58] me repeat verse 23 it was therefore
[49:00] necessary that the patterns of things in
[49:04] the heavens should be purified with
[49:06] these but the heavenly things themselves
[49:10] with better sacrifices than these
[49:13] hallelujah praise God
[49:15] altar in the tabernacle the altar in the
[49:17] temple it received a lot of blood the
[49:20] blood of goats and calves and and and
[49:23] bullocks and doves but the real altar
[49:28] received only one blood hallelujah
[49:31] Precious Blood the blood of redemption
[49:34] the blood of Jesus Christ our Savior
[49:36] verse 24 for Christ it's not entered
[49:42] into the holy places made with hands on
[49:44] the earth which are the figures of the
[49:47] true those things that are in heaven but
[49:50] into heaven itself now to appear in the
[49:54] presence of God for us Oh hallelujah
[49:58] that's where the real price was paid he
[50:02] laid his own blood on the altar his
[50:08] blood on the real Holy of Holies which
[50:11] is the throne of God this is why you and
[50:14] I are saved everything else that was
[50:16] taking place in the tabernacle and in
[50:19] the temple it was only sufficient for
[50:22] that moment but what he has done for us
[50:25] remember it has purchased eternal
[50:28] redemption for all mankind
[50:30] verse 24 again for Christ is not entered
[50:33] into the holy places made with hands
[50:35] which are the figures of the true but
[50:37] into heaven itself now to appear in the
[50:41] presence of God for us I want you to say
[50:44] for me he has appeared for me hallelujah
[50:49] and thank God he didn't appear
[50:52] empty-handed he appeared with the blood
[50:56] of redemption nor yet that he should
[51:00] offer himself often as the high priest
[51:04] enter it entereth into the holy place
[51:06] every year with blood of others oh no
[51:10] verse 26 for then must he often have
[51:15] suffered since the foundation of the
[51:18] world but now once in the end of the
[51:21] world hath he appeared to put away sin
[51:24] by the sacrifice of himself this
[51:28] sinn issue if you can believe if you can
[51:32] believe the sin problem is solved the
[51:36] sin issue has been dealt with once and
[51:40] for all by the blood of the spotless
[51:43] Lamb of God and all we have to do is be
[51:47] willing to repent of our unbelief to
[51:50] accept that sacrifice on our behalf and
[51:53] serve God what does it mean brother
[51:57] Shelly to serve God it means to give him
[52:01] control it means to obey his word as we
[52:07] can see it and know it by the spirit it
[52:11] means to choose the right thing to
[52:13] choose love it's not always easy to
[52:16] choose love but it's our responsibility
[52:18] to choose love and to find out what God
[52:22] wants from our lives so that every day
[52:25] we're living alive
[52:27] as we mentioned so that the lamb may
[52:30] receive the reward for his suffering and
[52:34] Ephesians 4:10 he that descended is the
[52:39] same that also ascended up far above all
[52:45] heavens that he might fill all things
[52:52] fulfill means to fill up to its
[52:56] completeness and what the blood of all
[53:00] of these other animals could not do
[53:02] thanks be to God the blood of the Lord
[53:06] Jesus Christ took care of it let me
[53:08] share one more verse and that is
[53:12] Colossians chapter 2 verse 14 and 15
[53:15] blotting out the handwriting of
[53:18] Ordinances that was against us which was
[53:21] contrary to us and took it out of the
[53:24] way nailing it to the cross every
[53:27] accusation against my soul every
[53:30] accusation against my life has been
[53:32] nailed to the cross and when Jesus was
[53:36] dying the lie against me died the
[53:40] accusation
[53:41] against me died it doesn't even matter
[53:43] that I was guilty I was guilty it wasn't
[53:48] just a made-up accusation it was the
[53:50] truth I was guilty of sin the scripture
[53:54] says shapen and born in iniquity formed
[53:59] that way came into this world speaking
[54:01] lies and as soon as I was old enough I
[54:04] would make choices that would bring me
[54:07] into further unbelief and into further
[54:09] sin but every bit of that was nailed to
[54:12] the cross when my Lord was nailed to the
[54:15] cross having been made sin woe for you
[54:19] and I that every bit of my debt was
[54:23] nailed there as well and he paid the
[54:26] price verse 15 and having spoiled
[54:29] principalities and powers he made a show
[54:33] of them openly triumphing over them in
[54:38] it it's really a celebration but he also
[54:43] mocked them it's the same demonstration
[54:48] as as Elijah when when the the showdown
[54:52] on Mount on Mount Carmel was taking
[54:55] place and and they the followers of Al
[54:58] they jumped around and screamed and
[55:00] hollered and cut themselves and did all
[55:02] kinds of things to get their false gods
[55:04] there they're non-existent God to move
[55:06] on their behalf and Elijah walked up and
[55:09] mocked him a little bit he said where is
[55:11] your God is he on vacation he must be
[55:13] asleep
[55:13] this scripture says that when our Lord
[55:16] died on the cross he did exactly that he
[55:19] was mocking the principalities he was
[55:22] showing them hey what you have desired
[55:25] to do today is defeated you have desired
[55:29] to take all men to hell
[55:31] you've desired you're a thief and a
[55:35] murderer the thief cometh not more but
[55:38] for to steal and to kill and to destroy
[55:40] but by the death of Jesus Christ on that
[55:43] cross when he offered himself up he made
[55:46] a show of them openly triumphing over
[55:51] them
[55:52] in it hallelujah what you meant
[55:55] you meant to destroy all of mankind
[55:58] today that is canceled today away has
[56:00] been made hallelujah I feel good I'm
[56:04] excited to be a part of this great
[56:07] program this great plan so this series
[56:10] the fullness of the time means that we
[56:14] can now live in the full inheritance of
[56:18] God's spiritual blessings in our life if
[56:21] we are willing to surrender everything
[56:25] we have everything we are to his
[56:28] Sovereign Grace I'm telling you this
[56:31] couldn't have happened any other way
[56:32] than the way it has happened God made
[56:36] the plan God paid the price on our
[56:40] behalf and what we want to do is worship
[56:43] Him

[56:47] just with my body but with my whole life
[56:50] I want to give him everything I pray for
[56:52] you right now in the name of the Lord
[56:54] Jesus Christ that this beautiful plan of
[56:58] redemption that came in the fullness of
[57:00] the time I pray that it will be made
[57:02] such a living reality to you that from
[57:05] this day forward you will choose to live
[57:08] a lay down life for the one who laid
[57:11] down his life on your behalf I pray for
[57:15] healing in your body because that is the
[57:18] promise of the word he was wounded for
[57:21] our transgression and bruised for our
