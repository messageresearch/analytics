[0:36] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[0:39] Shelley and you're watching the Eagles
[0:41] cry welcome to the broadcast today we're
[0:45] in the middle of a series on the spirit
[0:47] and power of Elijah past present and
[0:51] future we are examining together the
[0:54] life of Elijah the Prophet right out of
[0:57] the book of Kings from the Old Testament
[0:59] of the scripture and we are examining
[1:02] his strengths and even at times his
[1:06] weaknesses because the Bible tells us in
[1:09] Malachi that the spirit of Elijah is
[1:13] such a unique anointing that it will
[1:17] return to the earth more than one time
[1:20] and just when the earth is positioned to
[1:23] be smitten with a curse Malachi said the
[1:27] spirit of Elijah will return again and
[1:30] we have seen that throughout the
[1:33] scriptural history and we want to look
[1:36] at that a few more programs we're
[1:38] there's just this is such a big subject
[1:41] that we're covering a lot of ground but
[1:43] it's taking us some time to get there so
[1:46] I hope you'll bear with us stick around
[1:48] let me remind you before we look to the
[1:51] scripture today that we are happy to

[2:17] to sew sew into the ministries that
[2:20] bring you fine Christian Broadcasting I
[2:24] thank God for every network that airs

[2:34] prosper them so whatever you can do to
[2:36] be a blessing so that this continues to
[2:39] go forward while I know that God will
[2:41] richly bless you for your dedicated
[2:44] prayer and for any sewing that you might
[2:47] be able
[2:47] do financially to help them continue in
[2:50] the great work of God right here in the
[2:53] end time we want to look at the
[2:55] scripture today as I described earlier
[2:58] to find out more about the
[3:00] characteristics of Elijah the Prophet he
[3:04] was number one a man of the wilderness
[3:06] number two he was a man who was not
[3:09] afraid to confront false religion and he
[3:14] was also courageous in in his challenge
[3:19] to call people back to from the norm of
[3:23] the day a lukewarm faith to a fiery
[3:27] faith God used him to turn hearts back
[3:31] back to the beginning back to the
[3:34] original back to the foundation and he
[3:37] was also a man who demonstrated the raw
[3:39] power of God he had the grace of God to
[3:43] be able to speak to the heavens and they
[3:45] would give their water in rain or shut
[3:49] him up with the authority of his words
[3:51] so that it rain not he was a prophet of
[3:54] fire as we talked about when he met that
[3:59] great challenge on them on Mount Carmel
[4:01] showed that the Living God the God of
[4:04] the Bible is victorious and he really
[4:08] exposed the fallacy of Al a false god a
[4:12] figment of men's imaginations but today
[4:16] I want us to talk about the fact that
[4:19] Elijah also experienced some emotional
[4:24] lows in his life we read on the last
[4:27] broadcast from the book of James you
[4:29] might remember that chapter 5 we read 17
[4:34] and 18 I want to reread James 517 in the
[4:38] Amplified Bible it said Elijah was a
[4:42] human being with a nature such as we
[4:45] have with feelings affections and a
[4:48] constitution that means a will like ours
[4:51] and he prayed earnestly for it not to
[4:54] rain and no rain fell on the earth for
[4:57] three years in six months I reread that
[5:00] verse because I want you to know that
[5:02] though he was a mighty powerful prophet
[5:05] of God who demonstrated the raw power of
[5:09] God he was still a man with feelings
[5:12] with emotions with highs and with lows
[5:16] like every other man on the earth every
[5:19] other woman on the earth too and so I
[5:22] want you to note that I want you to note
[5:25] that he experienced tremendous emotional
[5:27] highs but would often very quickly find
[5:30] himself in the lowest place of
[5:33] discouragement I noticed in the
[5:36] scripture in first Kings chapter 19
[5:39] beginning in verse 4 here's one of those
[5:42] low moments and I'd like to point out in
[5:46] chronology that this was immediately
[5:49] after the great showdown on Mount Carmel
[5:52] he had just saw perhaps the greatest
[5:56] demonstration of supernatural power the
[6:00] fire of God that he'd ever seen in his
[6:02] life and from that great event verse 4
[6:08] tells us he himself went a day's journey
[6:11] into the wilderness and came and sat
[6:15] down under a juniper tree and he
[6:18] requested for himself that he might die
[6:21] imagine that the greatest campaign of
[6:25] his ministry the greatest crusade
[6:28] revival evangelistic outreach that he
[6:32] had ever known in his ministry and one
[6:35] day later he sits under a tree in the
[6:38] wilderness and says oh let me die as
[6:42] though he had no reason to live he said
[6:45] it is enough now o Lord take away my
[6:49] life for I am no better than my father's
[6:52] and as he lay and slept under a juniper
[6:56] tree behold then an angel touched him
[7:00] and said unto Him arise and eat and he
[7:04] looked and behold there was a cake bacon
[7:07] on the coals and a cruise of water at
[7:11] his head
[7:12] and he did eat and drink and laid him
[7:15] down again and the angel of the Lord
[7:17] came again the second time touched him
[7:20] and said arise and eat because the
[7:22] journey is too great for thee and he
[7:26] arose and did eat and drink listen at
[7:29] the supernatural element the
[7:31] supernatural manifestation of that food
[7:35] prepared by the angel he went in the
[7:38] strength of that meat 40 days and 40
[7:43] nights unto Horeb the Mount of God now
[7:47] he went from a extreme emotional high
[7:52] look what the lord is done to an extreme
[7:55] emotional though I might as well die all
[7:58] my father's have died God met him even
[8:02] in that place of emotional Oh God met
[8:05] him by the angel gave him food to eat
[8:09] another good nap and fed him again and
[8:12] the strength of that meat lasted 40 days
[8:15] and 40 nights so that he could get to
[8:18] his next great assignment I'm pointing
[8:21] that out because I want you to know that
[8:24] if this generation should experience a
[8:28] company of men and women anointed by the
[8:32] spirit and power of Elijah they won't be
[8:35] superhuman no there they will be regular
[8:39] ordinary human beings same constitution
[8:43] of someone else same emotion same will
[8:46] same struggle same battle and yet chosen
[8:50] for a high purpose for a high calling I
[8:53] say that because I think it's important
[8:56] for us to know that even though God used
[8:58] Elijah in such an outstanding way he was
[9:02] still a human being he still struggled
[9:04] and maybe maybe friend a little bit more
[9:08] than the ordinary person I know in my
[9:11] own small ministry that there have been
[9:14] times in my life when God really used me
[9:18] in what I thought was a profound in
[9:21] supernatural way and I just felt
[9:25] that that euphoria of being used of God
[9:28] there's not a greater feeling in all the
[9:30] world you'd leave the pulpit you'd be
[9:33] almost on a high for what God had done
[9:36] and grateful and humble that he would
[9:40] let you be a small part of that I've
[9:42] gone back to the hotel I've gone back to
[9:45] my home or to the home where I was
[9:47] staying and fought the enemy all night
[9:50] long solo so discouraged listening to
[9:55] lies that the enemy would put in my mind
[9:59] all night long I understand what it
[10:02] means to come under that kind of an
[10:05] attack when the anointing is on us why
[10:08] we feel like we could kill a bear
[10:10] wrestle with a giant or defeat an army
[10:14] you know but sometimes when that
[10:16] anointing lifts off of us it doesn't
[10:19] just leave us like it was when it came
[10:22] it seems that it even pushes our
[10:24] emotions down a little bit more why are
[10:27] you saying that because i want to
[10:29] encourage some of you who are watching
[10:31] this program around the world who fight
[10:34] with your emotional highs and lows this
[10:37] is something that we need to guard
[10:39] ourselves concerning we need to take a
[10:42] little warning in this it may happen
[10:46] that we who come under the inspiration
[10:49] and the anointing of the spirit and
[10:52] power of Elijah to help bring in the
[10:54] final harvest it may be that we have to
[10:57] guard more than ordinary folk around us
[11:00] that we when those moments of aloneness
[11:04] come when we feel so lonely in the
[11:07] battle here's another example 1st Kings
[11:10] same chapter chapter 19 at beginning in
[11:14] verse 14 and he said I have been very
[11:17] jealous for the Lord God of hosts
[11:20] because the children of Israel have
[11:23] forsaken thy covenant thrown down nine
[11:25] altars and slain thy prophets with the
[11:28] sword and I even I only am left and they
[11:34] seek my life to take it away
[11:37] how depressed he got look how
[11:39] discouraged he got and how he had this
[11:42] tendency to feel like he was the only
[11:44] one now I know you you and I've probably
[11:47] never felt that way have we ha yes we
[11:49] have they're probably been times that we
[11:53] felt all alone in this battle I mean
[11:55] good friend surrounding us and still
[11:58] feeling so lonely and so misunderstood
[12:02] and here was the mighty prophet Elijah
[12:05] feeling the exact same way well that
[12:08] doesn't make me feel like I have an
[12:10] excuse to be down in the dumps but it
[12:14] helps me to understand that if it
[12:17] happened to a great man of God like that
[12:19] well I'm no better than that so I might
[12:22] have to to face some of the same things
[12:23] and as we have said if God raises up a
[12:27] company of men and women who function in
[12:30] the spirit and power of Elijah they're
[12:32] going to be ordinary folk they're going
[12:35] to fight emotionally some time to stay
[12:37] on top and we must not give up in those
[12:41] moments where we feel like we're the
[12:43] only one we must not judge you know the
[12:47] intentions of other men's hearts because
[12:50] truly we're not the only one and God
[12:52] made it clear see he made it clear to
[12:55] Elijah here let's go down just a moment
[13:00] verse 15 and the Lord said unto Him gold
[13:03] return on thy way to the wilderness of
[13:06] Damascus and when thou comest anoint has
[13:09] Al to be king over Syria and Jehu the
[13:13] son of NIMH she shalt thou anointed king
[13:16] over Israel and Elijah the son of chef
[13:19] at of a boat mahalo shall anoint to be a
[13:24] prophet in thy room and it shall come to
[13:26] pass that him that escaped at the sword
[13:29] of hazael shall you who slay and him
[13:32] that escaped it from the sort of Jay who
[13:34] shall Elijah slay but look at verse 18
[13:37] yet I have left me seven thousand Elijah
[13:43] you you thought you were the only one I
[13:46] even I alone him left he said
[13:50] God had to remind his profit yet I have
[13:53] left me 7,000 in Israel all the knees
[13:58] which have not bowed under bail and
[14:01] every mouth which have not kissed him
[14:04] what an encouragement it must have been
[14:06] I'm not sure that Elijah was prepared to
[14:09] hear that at the moment but eventually
[14:11] it must have encouraged him to know here
[14:14] I feel like I'm the only person holding
[14:16] on to the faith and yet there are seven
[14:18] thousand others praise God who are
[14:21] holding on that's like reinforcement and
[14:24] so it appears that when this kind of her
[14:29] all power gets demonstrated in someone's
[14:32] life that it works on them it works on
[14:35] their emotion and so we must guard
[14:38] against this tendency God wants to fill
[14:41] us with incredible joy you know joy is
[14:45] the remedy for depression joy is the
[14:50] remedy for a lot of stuff and yet we
[14:53] sometimes get joy and happiness a little
[14:58] bit confused happiness is an emotion
[15:01] that is based on your circumstances you
[15:05] know you're having a birthday everyone's
[15:07] there to celebrate it's a happy time but
[15:10] if you're in the midst of a deep dark
[15:12] trial you don't feel very happy and so
[15:15] happiness goals and comes often times
[15:19] based on what's going on around us our
[15:22] present atmosphere or our present
[15:24] circumstances but not joy joy is a deep
[15:29] abiding place in the Lord that gives us
[15:33] strength remember the scripture the joy
[15:35] of the Lord is our strength it is my
[15:40] strength and so we want to ask the Lord
[15:43] to to give us his joy that will
[15:46] strengthen us in those times when we go
[15:50] from emotional highs being used mightily
[15:53] of God to a moment of almost feeling
[15:56] Forsaken and like we're the only one if
[15:59] we could ask for a
[16:01] a real baptism an outpouring of joy that
[16:06] would help balance our emotions so maybe
[16:09] the highs aren't quite as high and the
[16:11] lows aren't quite as low but we can just
[16:14] remain a little more even I believe that
[16:17] what that does is it cuts out a lot of
[16:21] the opportunity and advantage that Satan
[16:24] has to work on our minds to discourage
[16:28] us to lie to us you know he's the father
[16:31] of all eyes and he delights in lying to
[16:35] the children of God nobody loves you
[16:37] nobody appreciates you he'll say nobody
[16:40] really cares the sacrifice you're making
[16:42] to try to be a blessing in their life if
[16:44] you get caught it listing to the lies of
[16:47] the enemy you'll spend your whole life
[16:49] asleep under the juniper tree you won't
[16:52] even wake up and and accept the
[16:54] provision of the Lord you know there are
[16:56] times that people get so low that even
[16:58] the Lord comes to encourage them and
[17:01] they're close to it I'm glad that Elijah
[17:03] was able to be awakened by the angel eat
[17:07] this good food that God prepared go back
[17:09] to sleep get a little more rest for his
[17:12] physical body this is one of the things
[17:14] that I think affects our emotions is not
[17:17] getting the proper rest that we should
[17:20] get and I see Elijah here getting some
[17:22] rest and then bread is good and it's
[17:26] good nice to have bread nice to have but
[17:29] he needed some flesh he needed some he
[17:31] needed something that would give him
[17:33] some more strength because he was about
[17:35] to have an extension of strength God was
[17:38] about to take that nourishment that he
[17:41] gathered from that from that food that
[17:44] he ate and stretch it for a 40 day
[17:47] period now that is absolutely
[17:49] supernatural we don't ever want to get
[17:52] so low in our emotions we don't ever
[17:55] want to allow ourselves to get so low
[17:58] that we miss the instructions of the
[18:01] Lord and you know that's what Satan
[18:03] wants he wants to press us down that's
[18:07] what depression is it's being pressed
[18:10] down and he wants to dulles and press us
[18:14] down
[18:15] ultimately so that we can miss the
[18:17] father's instructions so that we can
[18:20] miss the gentle leadership of the Holy
[18:22] Spirit and so I'm going to ask the Lord
[18:25] sincerely to help us get ready men and
[18:29] women of the remnant Bride of Christ
[18:31] that God would help us to get ready to
[18:34] let the joy of the Lord sustain us in
[18:38] such a way that we get better control
[18:42] you know I think we can do this with the
[18:45] help of the lord i'm not going to dare
[18:47] think I can do this myself but with the
[18:50] help of the Lord I think I can bring
[18:52] some control to to my emotions I believe
[18:56] I can surrender to joy I believe that I
[18:59] can make a conscious decision when the
[19:02] enemy comes to disturb my peace and he
[19:05] will do it brother every morning he has
[19:08] a new assignment against you and I to
[19:10] disturb our peace because it's when
[19:13] we're at peace that we have rest rest
[19:17] brings confidence and trust but if we
[19:20] get disturbed in our peace and our soul
[19:23] is in turmoil then we have a hard time
[19:26] finding that place of rest in him and
[19:29] that's why so many people spend the
[19:32] biggest portion of their life just kind
[19:34] of spinning their wheels striving
[19:37] struggling to stay on top of the water I
[19:40] think they call it treading water when
[19:42] you're out there you can't touch bottom
[19:44] and you it seems like the shore is too
[19:48] far to swim too so you're just
[19:49] constantly moving quickly your hands and
[19:52] feet just to keep your head above water
[19:54] and boy you'll wear out in a hurry like
[19:57] that and hidden that the plot of Satan
[19:59] to wear out the Saints didn't the bible
[20:02] talk about the fact that he would seek
[20:04] to even change the times and the seasons
[20:06] to wear out the saints of God he has an
[20:10] assignment against the children of the
[20:12] Lord to wear you out physically if
[20:15] possible and to wear you out emotionally
[20:17] and so I just offer this this bit of
[20:24] instruction or advice or suggestion and
[20:27] I just asked
[20:28] that you make a conscious effort to push
[20:33] in the joy to position yourself ass for
[20:37] it I don't know if you've ever asked for
[20:39] joy or not do it ask the Lord Lord
[20:42] released to me ultimately your joy the
[20:46] joy that gives me strength the joy that
[20:49] gives me a song to sing in the midst of
[20:53] my suffering you know it it's a
[20:57] sacrifice to sing when you're in prison
[21:00] when you've been beaten when you're
[21:02] still in the stocks and and change of
[21:05] prison you've got to reach way down
[21:07] inside of you to get a song when you're
[21:10] really in the in the heat of a trial but
[21:12] Paul and Silas did what they did was
[21:15] they reach right down inside their
[21:17] spirit man and they pulled up joy they
[21:20] knew joy they had had joy that
[21:22] experience joy he just got pushed down
[21:24] by all the suffering and persecution
[21:26] that the children of God were going
[21:29] through in that hour but they were able
[21:31] to make the decision instead of moaning
[21:34] and groaning about their suffering are
[21:37] their wounds boy there were many they
[21:39] were in bad shape but in the midst of
[21:42] their bleeding in the midst of their
[21:44] suffering they reach way down into the
[21:46] inner man and pulled up joy out of the
[21:49] wells of salvation therefore with joy
[21:52] shall you draw water from the wells of
[21:55] salvation and that's what Paul and Silas
[21:57] did and you know what it did instead of
[21:59] a moan and a groan it birthed a song in
[22:02] them and they sang praises to God in the
[22:05] midnight hour I don't know if you've
[22:08] ever tried that strategy but I have and
[22:10] I tell you the song that God gives you
[22:13] in the midnight hour in the midst of
[22:15] your stripes in the midst of your
[22:18] suffering that's the sweetest song to
[22:20] the Lord I believe he loves that song it
[22:24] might not sound like anybody else's song
[22:26] but it's a song of praise it's a song of
[22:29] worship that's birthed out of your trial
[22:31] out of your suffering out of your pain
[22:34] you know the enemy wants to lock you in
[22:36] your pain he wants to shut you in so
[22:40] that all you can see is how
[22:42] bad things are but if you can reach
[22:44] right down into the inside of the inside
[22:46] finding that place of hope find that
[22:49] place of joy put your mind back on the
[22:51] Lord look read the Psalms that's what I
[22:54] do some time when I feel overwhelmed i
[22:57] just opened up my Bible and begin to
[22:59] read the Psalms out loud have you ever
[23:01] been in such a place in your spiritual
[23:05] life that you couldn't really pray well
[23:07] isn't that the trick of the enemy
[23:08] because prayer is one of the ways that
[23:11] we bring ourselves in back into
[23:13] fellowship in contact with God so if the
[23:16] enemy can suppress you that you can't
[23:19] find the words to pray or the strength
[23:20] to pray or the faith to pray then really
[23:23] you're just locked in you're really in a
[23:25] prison so what I do some time when I
[23:28] just don't have though I just don't know
[23:29] what to pray I I don't have hardly the
[23:32] strength to pray or maybe my faith is
[23:34] gotten weak then I just read the songs
[23:36] and I say Lord I may not feel like it
[23:40] right now but I believe that I believe
[23:42] this I may not sound like it I may not
[23:45] even be living like but but I believe
[23:47] that you're the God who is underneath
[23:50] the everlasting arms I believe you're
[23:52] the God who whose name is a strong tower
[23:55] and the righteous run into it you may
[23:58] think that this is too basic but I go
[24:01] back to Psalm 23 oftentimes I either
[24:05] quote what I can remember or read it to
[24:07] the Lord Lord you're my shepherd I feel
[24:11] like a dumb sheep right now I really do
[24:13] lord but you are my shepherd and if
[24:16] you're my shepherd you'll lead me and
[24:19] then go through the rest of it but
[24:21] beside the still waters you'll lead me
[24:24] in green pastures you will prepare a
[24:27] table before me in the presence of my
[24:30] enemies you get down there toward the
[24:32] bottom surely goodness and mercy by the
[24:34] time I get to that I'm already restored
[24:37] really surely goodness and mercy shall
[24:39] follow me all the days of my life and I
[24:42] will dwell in the house of the Lord
[24:44] forever you start out in pain and you
[24:47] end up realizing that no matter where
[24:49] you go goodness and mercy is coming
[24:51] behind you God hasn't forgotten you or
[24:54] forsaken you
[24:56] the enemy is just working on your mind
[24:58] and working on your emotions I want you
[25:01] to know that that that from from a
[25:03] scientific point of view your brain
[25:06] doesn't control the mind but your mind
[25:10] has controller influence over the brain
[25:12] and so sometimes we we think of them as
[25:16] the same but the soul is the mind and
[25:20] the will and the emotions the brain is
[25:24] is this computer up here that
[25:26] communicates with the rest of our body
[25:28] and we would think that the brain being
[25:32] the the control tower of the physical
[25:35] body we would think that the brain has
[25:38] the ability to to control or direct the
[25:42] mind but the mind in the realm of a soul
[25:46] actually has the ability to direct the
[25:49] brain what in the world are you saying
[25:51] I'm saying that if our mind is in a dark
[25:54] place if our mind is in a negative place
[25:58] and all we can think about and
[26:01] concentrate on and focus on is
[26:03] negativity it's like acid in our spirits
[26:07] first of all it's like acid in our
[26:09] spiritual life but it actually becomes
[26:12] like acid in the brain and so our
[26:15] physical brain hear me our physical
[26:18] brain can become greatly affected by
[26:23] what's going on in the soul what's going
[26:25] on in the mind in the will and in the
[26:28] emotions so when you realize that you're
[26:31] getting in that kind of a dark place let
[26:33] the Word of God be strength to you let
[26:36] the Psalms be your vocabulary if you
[26:41] can't find your own words use God's Word
[26:45] this is how Jesus met Satan's temptation
[26:48] in the wilderness he said Satan it is
[26:52] written let me pray father thank you for
[26:55] the promise of your word thank you for
[26:58] the truth that sets us free thank you
[27:01] for giving us this precious book as a
[27:05] vocabulary to you
[27:07] in pressings prayer and in worship when
[27:11] we need to press back in find our place
[27:14] of joy and restoration and we don't know
[27:17] what of what to say or what to do next
[27:19] thank you for the word that guides our
[27:21] path I pray right now that you'll help
[27:24] every one of us to guard our emotions so
[27:27] that we can remain in a place where you
[27:29] can instruct us and help us we ask these
[27:32] things in the mighty name of the Lord
[27:34] Jesus Christ and for his glory alone
[27:36] thank you for taking time to stay with
[27:39] me and watch the Eagles cry if you'll
[27:41] tune in again I'll be back god bless you
[27:44] bye bye for now
[28:09] you
