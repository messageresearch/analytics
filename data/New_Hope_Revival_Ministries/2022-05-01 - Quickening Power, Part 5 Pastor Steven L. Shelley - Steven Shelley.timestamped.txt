[48:11] i bless you jesus
[48:13] [Music]
[48:15] i bless you jesus i bless you jesus
[48:21] i've always been afraid to
[48:24] uh
[48:26] a lot of times we get things in our
[48:28] minds and we
[48:29] you know we speak them
[48:31] but i've always been afraid i just want
[48:34] to make sure that it's the lord
[48:37] and i
[48:40] i don't know
[48:41] i don't know
[48:43] the lord didn't give me one
[48:45] one thing to say
[48:47] before i got up here
[48:50] but i'm trusting him
[48:52] that this is him and that he's
[48:54] telling me to speak to you and
[48:57] tell you that he's real pleased
[49:00] with the worship and the lives that
[49:01] you're living
[49:03] these
[49:05] he's very happy about it because you're
[49:07] the cream of the crop
[49:09] there's not many people that he can
[49:11] depend on to be
[49:13] honest and
[49:15] clean like you are
[49:17] he said watch the little foxes it's not
[49:20] the big things that he
[49:21] that you're going to do you're not going
[49:23] out and you're not going to drink or run
[49:25] around on your wife or
[49:27] do wrong
[49:28] you young boys are not going to do wrong
[49:31] and the devil knows that but it's the
[49:33] little things
[49:35] he said be careful because
[49:38] every idol word
[49:40] every word that you speak
[49:44] you are sowing a seed
[49:46] and you will reap that seed
[49:49] and he doesn't want you to reach
[49:52] reap nothing but a good harvest
[49:55] he he's starting to drop in here
[50:01] he's here
[50:03] his spirit is here
[50:05] but he he wants to drop in here
[50:09] and he wants
[50:10] those things that he wants to do for
[50:12] each and every one of us uh we're chosen
[50:16] whether or not you like it whether or
[50:18] not you agree with it you are chosen to
[50:21] be here
[50:23] and and the lord is you're in training
[50:26] you're learning
[50:28] you uh you are uh
[50:31] if you feel uh and i'm going to tell you
[50:35] if you feel a little urge that god wants
[50:38] you to speak or something do it
[50:40] it's not an easy thing to do it's not
[50:43] easy to sing it's not easy to testify
[50:46] it's not easy to prophesy
[50:49] but if you feel that little urge move on
[50:52] it
[50:53] i
[50:54] i don't
[50:55] i don't want to
[50:58] do or say anything that god wouldn't
[51:00] want me to but i'm telling you
[51:02] the lord has really laid it on my heart
[51:05] heavy today
[51:07] watch the seed that you sow
[51:12] when you speak bad of a brother or
[51:14] sister or you
[51:17] i don't want to say you make fun of
[51:19] nobody i don't believe you do that
[51:22] but just be careful how you size people
[51:25] up because what goes through your eye
[51:27] gate it's in your heart
[51:31] don't plant any bad seed cause you don't
[51:34] want to reap any bad sin
[51:36] think about how you've lived this
[51:38] morning or how you've lived so far today
[51:41] think about it if there's anything that
[51:44] you've done that you think god is
[51:46] displeased with you can cover it with
[51:47] the blood of jesus
[51:50] you can cover it
[51:52] if you sow a bad crop you can stop it
[51:58] i love all of you
[52:02] god loves you
[52:05] he's the king of king and the lord of
[52:07] lords he's the creator of heaven and
[52:09] earth in every good thing
[52:12] he created you
[52:14] he's called you he chose you he saved
[52:17] you and i hope you're filled with the
[52:18] holy ghost
[52:20] but you're here for a reason
[52:24] let god use you
[52:27] love one another is the greatest thing
[52:31] worship
[52:33] worship does away with a lot of sin
[52:37] worship god he deserves it

[1:23:58] and i wish that we could just greet you
[1:24:00] all by name and tell you how much we
[1:24:02] appreciate you being connected but time
[1:24:05] wouldn't allow that this morning
[1:24:07] beginning in verse 14
[1:24:10] nevertheless death
[1:24:13] reigned from adam
[1:24:15] to moses
[1:24:18] even over them that had not sinned after
[1:24:22] the similitude of adam's transgression
[1:24:27] who is the figure
[1:24:29] of him
[1:24:30] that was to come
[1:24:33] adam being a figure a type
[1:24:37] a symbol of he who was to come
[1:24:41] and now in verse 16.
[1:24:51] all right
[1:24:52] and not as it was by one that sin
[1:24:56] so is the gift
[1:24:58] for the judgment was by one to
[1:25:01] condemnation
[1:25:03] but the free gift is
[1:25:05] of many offenses unto
[1:25:09] justification
[1:25:11] let's read on
[1:25:12] for if by one man's offense
[1:25:16] death reigned by one
[1:25:18] much more they which receive abundance
[1:25:22] of grace and of the gift of
[1:25:25] righteousness
[1:25:26] shall reign in life by one
[1:25:30] jesus christ
[1:25:32] one man's offense
[1:25:34] changed the world
[1:25:37] and one man's righteous sacrifice
[1:25:41] redeemed the world aren't we blessed to
[1:25:43] know that this morning
[1:25:45] therefore as by the offense of one
[1:25:48] judgment came upon all men to
[1:25:50] condemnation
[1:25:52] even so
[1:25:53] by the righteousness of one the free
[1:25:56] gift came upon all men
[1:26:00] unto justification
[1:26:03] of life
[1:26:04] for as by one man's disobedience
[1:26:08] many were made sinners
[1:26:10] so by the obedience of one shall many be
[1:26:16] made righteous how many of you are
[1:26:19] partakers of the righteousness of god
[1:26:23] today
[1:26:24] right now you are partaking of his
[1:26:27] righteousness you are covered by the
[1:26:30] righteousness of the lord jesus christ
[1:26:33] let me see your witness
[1:26:34] amen god bless you as you are seated
[1:26:40] in the message
[1:26:42] the manifestation of the spirit
[1:26:46] in
[1:26:46] toledo ohio
[1:26:49] well let's not go there just yet
[1:26:52] let let me go back just a bit
[1:26:55] i think that we read
[1:26:58] several of these scriptures
[1:27:01] quotes and scriptures last sunday
[1:27:04] but i want to go to the breach if you
[1:27:06] can find that one for me
[1:27:08] uh paragraph 116.
[1:27:12] let's look at that before we get started
[1:27:14] good this morning we understand that
[1:27:17] adam
[1:27:18] held the title deed of planet earth it
[1:27:23] was entrusted to him in the garden
[1:27:26] he was given the authority to by the
[1:27:30] spoken word he was able to rearrange and
[1:27:34] have dominion over the entire earth is
[1:27:37] that right and last sunday we talked
[1:27:39] about how when if if there was a tree if
[1:27:43] if mrs adam or eve if she needed a tree
[1:27:46] moved or something made a little
[1:27:49] different in her back garden near the
[1:27:51] terrace adam didn't have to use the
[1:27:54] sweat of his brow originally to do that
[1:27:57] he could just do it by the spoken word
[1:28:00] he could just say tree be moved over
[1:28:03] here and the tree just picked itself up
[1:28:06] and moved somebody said that sounds like
[1:28:08] fantasy oh
[1:28:10] you've never lived in an earth that was
[1:28:12] controlled by the spoken word
[1:28:15] you and i have no way unless we we see
[1:28:18] it somehow like a cartoon or some
[1:28:21] animated adventure the only way we can
[1:28:24] even get our minds around the authority
[1:28:27] and the dominion that adam had in the
[1:28:30] earth we have to really use our
[1:28:31] imagination to even get to that place
[1:28:34] can you say amen
[1:28:36] everybody looking this way now
[1:28:38] we're going to pull
[1:28:40] together because we want to go somewhere
[1:28:44] in paragraph 116 he said now oh my
[1:28:48] now the forfeited title
[1:28:52] deed is now
[1:28:54] in the hands of the original
[1:28:57] owner
[1:28:58] almighty god
[1:29:00] when adam took upon himself the sin of
[1:29:04] his wife eve
[1:29:06] adam not being deceived the bible tells
[1:29:09] us
[1:29:10] but he being a type of the christ that
[1:29:14] was to come
[1:29:15] the scripture said she did give to adam
[1:29:18] and he did eat also
[1:29:21] with eyes wide open
[1:29:25] knowing that this would be a way of
[1:29:28] taking her sin
[1:29:30] unto himself
[1:29:32] in that wonderful
[1:29:34] now he partook of sin
[1:29:36] he was pointing to another adam
[1:29:40] he was pointing to an ultimate redeemer
[1:29:43] that was to come but in that fall he
[1:29:46] lost possession of the title deed
[1:29:50] it left him and as brother branham is
[1:29:53] telling us here it went back into the
[1:29:56] hands of the original owner and who is
[1:29:59] that
[1:30:01] almighty god
[1:30:03] the title deed to the earth and to
[1:30:06] eternal life when adam forfeited it
[1:30:11] then satan's dirty hands oh i'm so
[1:30:14] thankful for that that satan's dirty
[1:30:17] hands could not take it so it went back
[1:30:21] to its original owner god himself
[1:30:26] hallelujah he said now we're going to
[1:30:28] find it just in a minute there he sits
[1:30:32] on the throne
[1:30:33] with it in his hand
[1:30:35] the title
[1:30:37] deed brother branham gets excited
[1:30:40] he claps his hands oh that makes me feel
[1:30:43] religious
[1:30:45] the title deed to eternal life
[1:30:49] the abstract titled deed to eternal life
[1:30:53] when adam forfeited it for wisdom
[1:30:56] instead of faith
[1:30:58] it went back to the hands of the owner
[1:31:01] almighty god he said what a great
[1:31:06] thing
[1:31:07] now in the message when their eyes were
[1:31:11] opened in
[1:31:12] spindale
[1:31:14] paragraph 17
[1:31:19] he goes on to say now
[1:31:22] i don't mean that he made one atonement
[1:31:24] for your sickness
[1:31:27] and one for your sins
[1:31:31] this is a powerful thing to note
[1:31:34] he didn't pay one price for healing
[1:31:37] and another price for redemption
[1:31:40] the healing of you of your body is a
[1:31:43] part of the one atonement
[1:31:45] hallelujah so the striping of his back
[1:31:48] and the shedding of his blood was
[1:31:51] sufficient enough to be bring both
[1:31:53] healing to your body and deliverance to
[1:31:57] your inner man
[1:31:58] oh
[1:31:59] what a good job he has done on our
[1:32:02] behalf
[1:32:03] he made one atonement
[1:32:06] and that was
[1:32:08] for sin
[1:32:10] and when you deal with
[1:32:12] sin
[1:32:13] you've got to deal with
[1:32:17] help me
[1:32:19] every
[1:32:20] attribute
[1:32:21] of sin now you now know what sickness is
[1:32:27] you might not have known it when you
[1:32:29] woke up this morning
[1:32:30] under the curse feeling some of that
[1:32:33] that hardship in your body you may not
[1:32:36] have understood that that is an
[1:32:38] attribute of sin
[1:32:40] but i've got good
[1:32:42] news for you today hallelujah the
[1:32:46] atonement is still in place
[1:32:49] the prize has still been paid
[1:32:52] the same blood that saves you can also
[1:32:56] bring healing and deliverance to your
[1:32:58] body somebody ought to give the lord a
[1:33:01] praise with me right now
[1:33:02] we're covered
[1:33:03] [Applause]
[1:33:06] it's sufficient
[1:33:09] to pay the price
[1:33:11] it he had a sacrifice
[1:33:14] in the atonement that deals with every
[1:33:18] attribute of sin
[1:33:20] he goes on to say the human race as
[1:33:23] we're taught in the scripture didn't
[1:33:25] have any sickness before sin came in
[1:33:30] my adam and eve would have lived in a
[1:33:33] body that would have never worn out
[1:33:36] that wasn't god's plan
[1:33:38] he just wanted to dangle that just a
[1:33:40] little bit so you and i could see
[1:33:43] what it can be what it will be what it
[1:33:47] is
[1:33:48] restored
[1:33:50] he said they didn't have any sickness
[1:33:53] before sin came in
[1:33:55] and when sin came in sickness was issued
[1:33:58] in as a attribute of sin which had to
[1:34:02] bring death
[1:34:04] because sickness leads to death death
[1:34:08] follows sickness
[1:34:10] he said sin is
[1:34:15] now that's why we can say from the
[1:34:17] message that there is no death in jesus
[1:34:20] christ
[1:34:21] none
[1:34:22] we don't die
[1:34:25] the saints of god don't die they just
[1:34:27] lay down this old house and they go
[1:34:29] right into the eternals
[1:34:32] right into the eternities hallelujah
[1:34:35] because death is is sin
[1:34:38] and sin is death and sickness follows
[1:34:42] sin
[1:34:44] uh what does this say here worry
[1:34:50] worry
[1:34:51] follows unbelief amen worry follows sin
[1:34:57] how many of you have a worry
[1:35:05] not a worry
[1:35:07] not a care
[1:35:09] because i know whose care i'm in
[1:35:12] but worries will creep in
[1:35:15] they slither in
[1:35:17] the enemy wants to bind us up in
[1:35:20] worrying about things that we cannot
[1:35:24] change anyway
[1:35:25] only sovereign god can make a difference
[1:35:29] and as we said tuesday night i think it
[1:35:31] was we worry maybe sunday we worry about
[1:35:35] things and most of the things that we so
[1:35:37] worry about never come to pass in the
[1:35:39] first place
[1:35:41] so we're burning up all this energy
[1:35:43] using up all these brain cells with
[1:35:46] what-ifs
[1:35:50] could'ves
[1:35:52] should'ves and would'ves and all this
[1:35:55] thing that the enemy uses to try to
[1:35:57] oppress us
[1:35:59] sin is death and sickness follows sin
[1:36:03] and worry follows sin did you ever
[1:36:06] notice what a horrible thing worry is
[1:36:09] and listen how he ends this sentence
[1:36:12] there's not one value in it
[1:36:16] at all
[1:36:20] you can't change one spot on the leopard
[1:36:23] you can add one cubit to your stature
[1:36:27] you can't change any circumstance of
[1:36:29] life with worry
[1:36:32] but how many of you know you can with
[1:36:34] faith
[1:36:35] you can with faith
[1:36:37] now i want to go to the manifestation of
[1:36:39] the spirit paragraph 17 and i'm doing
[1:36:43] this
[1:36:44] because i want you to see that adam has
[1:36:47] forfeited the title deed of the earth
[1:36:51] and in that title deed it lays the plan
[1:36:55] of all redemption
[1:36:57] now it goes back into the hands of the
[1:36:59] original owner but mankind is still lost
[1:37:05] he gave up he forfeited what he had now
[1:37:08] death has entered in by sin
[1:37:11] and there is no salvation to be found
[1:37:15] anywhere until the last adam comes
[1:37:19] and when the last adam came blessed be
[1:37:23] his holy name he took care of the sin
[1:37:25] problem i want to say this to you your
[1:37:28] sin problem has been taken care of
[1:37:33] it's done
[1:37:35] it's finished
[1:37:36] you've got to stay in fellowship now i
[1:37:38] knew that we would have to go a little
[1:37:40] slower this morning because we're tying
[1:37:43] together some things that we've just
[1:37:44] been hitting at over the last few
[1:37:46] services so thank you for staying with
[1:37:48] me because it helps us to be able to get
[1:37:51] through that i put too much work in this
[1:37:54] to just put it in the file i want to get
[1:37:56] it out there i want you to hear it i
[1:37:59] want you to get it in your spirit i want
[1:38:01] you to be reminded today of who you are
[1:38:04] and what you hold in your hand
[1:38:06] now in paragraph 17 he said now when
[1:38:09] jesus died at calvary look what he did
[1:38:12] he settled
[1:38:14] the sin question forever
[1:38:18] before
[1:38:19] the father
[1:38:27] you know these silly trinitarians
[1:38:33] silly
[1:38:36] people sometimes try to get me to
[1:38:40] believe or listen or follow some of
[1:38:42] these
[1:38:43] different things pass it ons and videos
[1:38:46] and clips and things that people pass on
[1:38:49] and sometimes i'm inspired
[1:38:52] but i can't get over the fact
[1:38:56] that if you don't know who god is
[1:39:03] how can i drink it your fountain right
[1:39:05] if you don't even know who he is
[1:39:10] i hear them trying to describe him and
[1:39:13] they say things like this the father is
[1:39:16] angry with you
[1:39:20] he's got white hair he's the judge he's
[1:39:24] got a gavel and he is ready to deal with
[1:39:27] the sin issue well i want to tell you
[1:39:29] something the sin issue has already been
[1:39:33] dealt with your father is no longer
[1:39:37] upset
[1:39:39] he's no longer angry
[1:39:41] because the price has been paid
[1:39:44] and jesus is the nice one
[1:39:47] father is the angry one the one who
[1:39:49] wants he wants judgment and justice and
[1:39:52] whatever else he can get and jesus is
[1:39:55] the sweet one
[1:39:56] and people say i have to pray to jesus
[1:39:59] because he's he's the sweet one
[1:40:03] somebody's very very very
[1:40:06] very confused
[1:40:09] hallelujah there would be no jesus had
[1:40:12] it not been for a loving father
[1:40:15] because god eternal he was loving you
[1:40:18] before the world was ever framed it was
[1:40:22] your father who had you in his mind
[1:40:26] before the foundation of the world and
[1:40:28] he said i have to go down and deal with
[1:40:31] this sin issue
[1:40:33] and so he came down in the form of a man
[1:40:37] the lord jesus christ
[1:40:39] brother branham tells us here now when
[1:40:41] jesus died at calvary he settled the sin
[1:40:46] question forever before the father
[1:40:49] because he was a you read it
[1:40:58] i don't know that don't always bother me
[1:40:59] but this morning it felt like a
[1:41:01] rattlesnake around my neck i'm getting
[1:41:04] rid of it for this morning is that all
[1:41:06] right
[1:41:07] because he was a perfect sacrifice for
[1:41:10] our sin oh listen he was our
[1:41:16] whoo
[1:41:17] he had to be one of us
[1:41:21] god had to be one of us
[1:41:23] before he could pay the price for us
[1:41:28] so he came to be
[1:41:30] a kinsmen redeemer he said you bible
[1:41:33] scholars know what i'm talking about or
[1:41:35] speaking of like boaz
[1:41:38] he had to be a kinsmen redeemer to
[1:41:41] redeem the lost estate of ruth
[1:41:44] and remember that it was from it was
[1:41:47] from this connection that our lord has
[1:41:50] come to us
[1:41:52] this was not just a bible story but it's
[1:41:55] part of your story
[1:41:58] hallelujah
[1:42:00] naomi followed her husband and with her
[1:42:02] sons and went into a strange land
[1:42:05] because there had been some famine going
[1:42:07] on and they went out a little ahead of
[1:42:09] time you know
[1:42:10] had a good desire it was a noble thing
[1:42:13] that they wanted to do in taking care of
[1:42:15] their family but but they left they they
[1:42:18] left behind where god had promised to do
[1:42:21] some mighty things on their behalf they
[1:42:24] ended up naomi ended up losing her
[1:42:26] husband and both of her sons and decided
[1:42:29] i'll go back and throw myself upon the
[1:42:32] mercy of my own people and see if they
[1:42:34] will take me in
[1:42:36] she had two daughter-in-laws one was
[1:42:39] orpah i sometimes call her oprah
[1:42:50] orpah
[1:42:51] and naomi
[1:42:53] no
[1:42:54] ruth two daughter-in-laws
[1:42:58] miss orpah she she was affectionate
[1:43:05] she kissed and turned back
[1:43:10] she kind of represents a fling
[1:43:15] that's all some people want with jesus
[1:43:18] it's a little rendezvous
[1:43:21] just give me a little fling and make me
[1:43:23] feel good she kissed and she went back
[1:43:28] but there was one who wasn't just a
[1:43:31] kisser
[1:43:33] ruth said i'm a cleaner
[1:43:37] i don't care where you go i'm going with
[1:43:40] you
[1:43:40] i don't care what you believe i'll
[1:43:42] believe it too your god will be my god
[1:43:47] your people will be my people i'm not
[1:43:50] just going to kiss and turn back but i'm
[1:43:53] going to hold on
[1:43:56] do you know why because ruth had a
[1:43:59] destiny promise that she didn't even
[1:44:01] know anything about she didn't know why
[1:44:04] she couldn't turn naomi loose
[1:44:07] she didn't understand what was waiting
[1:44:09] for her back in the land that god had
[1:44:12] given to his people she just knew i have
[1:44:14] to go i don't know what it's going to
[1:44:16] look like when i get there but i know i
[1:44:20] have to go
[1:44:22] there may be no house
[1:44:24] there may be no food
[1:44:25] i can't guarantee what it'll be like
[1:44:29] but i cannot let her go by herself i
[1:44:32] must go with her and whatever befalls
[1:44:34] her will befall me
[1:44:37] come on now
[1:44:38] a gentile
[1:44:43] a gentile
[1:44:45] grabbing a hold of a jew
[1:44:49] and saying wherever you go
[1:44:52] whithersoever thou goest i will go and
[1:44:55] where you lodge i will lodge your people
[1:44:57] will be my your god will be my
[1:45:00] whoo thank you lord
[1:45:04] thank you lord for using the
[1:45:07] thank you for using the gentile too
[1:45:10] thank you for having a plan
[1:45:13] oh for the nations
[1:45:15] i know that you loved and honored and
[1:45:17] favored israel above them all but thank
[1:45:20] you that you didn't leave the nations
[1:45:22] out
[1:45:23] for from our mother the king came
[1:45:28] a gentile
[1:45:30] a moabitish woman
[1:45:32] from the other side listen
[1:45:34] when i'm in the dead sea i like to go to
[1:45:36] the dead sea i like to float in the dead
[1:45:38] sea
[1:45:39] and when i'm in the dead sea
[1:45:42] i look across there to those brown hills
[1:45:45] that come right down to the edge of the
[1:45:47] other side of the dead sea and i realize
[1:45:50] that i'm looking into the nation of
[1:45:52] jordan which is the land of moab
[1:45:56] and i've never lay there on that water
[1:45:58] but and looked over over into moab
[1:46:01] modern day jordan but what i thought
[1:46:04] about the dedication that it took for
[1:46:08] ruth to say wherever you go i'm going
[1:46:10] with you
[1:46:12] and she gets over here
[1:46:15] things are old i don't know maybe they
[1:46:17] found the old
[1:46:18] ranch sacked house where they where
[1:46:20] naomi had lived and began to try to put
[1:46:23] life back together
[1:46:25] i just love it
[1:46:28] not in my notes this morning but i love
[1:46:30] it anyway
[1:46:31] oh and naomi's just waiting on ruth
[1:46:34] she's just waiting on her to get ready
[1:46:36] she oh she's already caught a glimpse
[1:46:40] let me tell you something naomi was a
[1:46:42] righteous woman
[1:46:43] she was a woman who had some intuition
[1:46:45] by the spirit and she was already
[1:46:47] catching the picture
[1:46:50] she said i'll tell you what you do
[1:46:52] you wait until the evening
[1:46:56] you wait until the threshers are resting
[1:46:59] there by the grain that they have cut
[1:47:01] down in the day and and you'll find even
[1:47:04] the master of the harvest you'll even
[1:47:06] find boy first of all
[1:47:09] boaz sees them out there gleaning in the
[1:47:12] fields which was a biblical order
[1:47:14] according to the old testament
[1:47:16] but but boaz he wasn't satisfied with
[1:47:19] just ordinary protocol because he saw
[1:47:22] that one of those gleaners was more
[1:47:24] beautiful than all the rest
[1:47:29] he said i don't know if you fellers have
[1:47:31] noticed or not but that one over there
[1:47:34] is a knockout
[1:47:37] she nearly knocks my socks off
[1:47:41] and if you don't mind i'd like for you
[1:47:43] to leave a little extra
[1:47:47] if you're from alabama you might say
[1:47:49] extre
[1:47:51] leave a little extra
[1:47:54] in the edges of the field so that when
[1:47:56] they go in hand fulls on purpose
[1:48:02] it reminds me of those eagles that make
[1:48:05] it out of their moping period
[1:48:08] and they get all the way back to the top
[1:48:10] and their strength is renewed and they
[1:48:13] rejoice that their strength and youth
[1:48:15] has been renewed and the first thing
[1:48:17] they do is they go down and find a kill
[1:48:20] they find an animal somewhere and they
[1:48:23] kill that animal and they rip it apart
[1:48:26] and they fly back over that valley
[1:48:28] dropping fresh meat
[1:48:34] handfuls on purpose for those that are
[1:48:37] trying to start their journey back to
[1:48:40] the rock from where they were born
[1:48:42] and so she gathers this extra mother
[1:48:44] just filling up the house with all these
[1:48:48] handfuls on purpose
[1:48:50] and uh naomi's watching this
[1:48:53] oh they're sitting down for a good cup
[1:48:56] of tea in the evening and
[1:48:58] and uh
[1:48:59] ruth said to
[1:49:01] naomi mother
[1:49:03] he said mother i know
[1:49:06] bless be the memory
[1:49:08] of your dear son
[1:49:10] and his brother and his father blessed
[1:49:13] be his memory
[1:49:15] but i'm wondering mother
[1:49:17] did you notice the way that your kin
[1:49:20] was looking at me today in the field
[1:49:24] oh she said yes i noticed
[1:49:27] her smile
[1:49:29] took all the worry that ruth had
[1:49:32] ruth was sitting there thinking how am i
[1:49:34] going to broach the subject
[1:49:36] how am i going to tell my widowed mother
[1:49:39] in law that i also the widow of her son
[1:49:43] have found an attraction
[1:49:51] but when
[1:49:52] naomi laughed the laugh of a mother
[1:49:57] all the worry just melted off of
[1:49:59] she said yes i've noticed and i'll tell
[1:50:01] you what you do you wait until the
[1:50:03] harvesters are resting and
[1:50:05] and the lord of the harvest will be
[1:50:07] there as well and i want you to slip in
[1:50:11] very very quietly
[1:50:14] i want you to raise the skirt of his
[1:50:17] garment and i want you to lay as close
[1:50:20] to his feet as you possibly can
[1:50:26] now we know from bible times that
[1:50:30] a person's feet
[1:50:32] represents their nakedness
[1:50:37] it represents
[1:50:39] who they are
[1:50:41] in vulnerability
[1:50:43] there was nothing sexual in this event
[1:50:47] at all
[1:50:49] she just just raised up
[1:50:52] the borders of his garment maybe
[1:50:55] something covering him just raised it up
[1:50:57] a little bit and i want you to know she
[1:50:59] laid her cheek down on the ground and
[1:51:01] she just took her little delicate hand
[1:51:03] and she just laid it up there on his
[1:51:06] foot
[1:51:07] and when he woke up in the morning here
[1:51:10] is a beautiful maiden laying there with
[1:51:13] his with her hand on his foot
[1:51:18] and this was an obligation now
[1:51:21] i got to do something with this girl
[1:51:27] she's now in my care
[1:51:30] i didn't see it coming so quickly
[1:51:34] naomi must be working overtime
[1:51:40] oh yeah
[1:51:41] like sister whitaker
[1:51:46] when i was up there preaching in canada
[1:51:48] stacy wasn't serving the lord at that
[1:51:51] time but sister whitaker met me after
[1:51:53] the service and she had a had a a
[1:51:56] a picture album picture thing with a
[1:51:59] little you know how it comes down like a
[1:52:01] recording or something and she was
[1:52:02] showing me her daughter isn't she birdie
[1:52:06] she's not serving the lord right now
[1:52:08] pray for her
[1:52:16] matchmaker matchmaker see
[1:52:19] uh there was that was nowhere in my mind
[1:52:24] i doubt it was in her mind
[1:52:27] she just wanted to get a little prayer
[1:52:28] for her daughter who needed a good
[1:52:30] stirring in her life
[1:52:33] naomi was working overtime to try to
[1:52:36] bring this listen she was fighting this
[1:52:39] this goes so so deep it could go so long
[1:52:41] and i don't want it to go so long this
[1:52:43] morning but i want you to know she was
[1:52:45] fighting for destiny
[1:52:47] she wasn't just being a busybody
[1:52:50] she was looking for a seed
[1:52:54] she knew that her family was destined to
[1:52:58] be a part of something bigger than all
[1:53:00] that death and destruction and famine
[1:53:03] that had tried to wipe them out
[1:53:05] and so she began to try to arrange a
[1:53:08] certain way so that life could be
[1:53:11] different and i don't know maybe she
[1:53:12] knew there was a king maybe she knew
[1:53:14] there was a king coming i don't know she
[1:53:17] was perhaps a woman of intuition she
[1:53:20] began to realize that something was
[1:53:21] going on and now now boaz is obligated
[1:53:27] he's the he's not the nearest kin
[1:53:31] but the nearest kin didn't really want
[1:53:32] no part of this arrangement
[1:53:35] so he's the second nearest kin
[1:53:37] and he's willing to take on the
[1:53:39] responsibility
[1:53:40] and make her his
[1:53:43] now i want you to know that's redemption
[1:53:45] story right there
[1:53:47] most of all because she was a gentile
[1:53:50] that's what makes it so powerful and so
[1:53:52] precious is that he was willing to go
[1:53:55] against his own law
[1:54:00] she was not his kin
[1:54:02] she was married to his kin
[1:54:05] but for naomi he could step up
[1:54:08] and make her his
[1:54:10] and he did
[1:54:12] and there came an old bed
[1:54:14] there came a jesse
[1:54:17] there came a david
[1:54:19] and if you read the new testament there
[1:54:21] came a christ
[1:54:24] hallelujah
[1:54:25] through this glorious beautiful
[1:54:28] redemption of a kinsmen redeemer now
[1:54:30] where are we you bible scholars know
[1:54:33] what i'm speaking of like boaz had to be
[1:54:36] a kinsmen redeemer to redeem the lost
[1:54:38] estate of ruth and he had to make a
[1:54:40] public testimony and then everything
[1:54:43] that ruth had fell to him as he redeemed
[1:54:46] all of her possessions and he of course
[1:54:48] when he redeemed naomi he got ruthian
[1:54:51] which is a type of the gentile bride
[1:54:58] amen
[1:55:00] those who were not even a
[1:55:02] people are now a people of god
[1:55:07] how many of you got something to be
[1:55:09] thankful for
[1:55:11] which is a type of the gentile bride but
[1:55:14] he was a kinsmen redeemer now god who is
[1:55:17] in spirit unveiled himself
[1:55:21] in a body of flesh which was his son
[1:55:24] christ jesus and god was in christ
[1:55:28] reconciling the world to himself
[1:55:32] that's the godhead
[1:55:37] it's not an angry one and a happy one
[1:55:40] and an extra one just for fun
[1:55:46] hear
[1:55:47] oh israel
[1:55:50] the lord is
[1:55:52] one
[1:55:54] one spirit
[1:55:57] one eternal spirit
[1:55:59] in veiled himself in a body of flesh
[1:56:02] which was his son christ jesus and god
[1:56:05] was in christ reconciling the world to
[1:56:07] himself and become kin folks
[1:56:10] to human beings to suffer the penalty
[1:56:14] that he had put on the human himself and
[1:56:16] he became kin folks
[1:56:19] you read the rest would you
[1:56:22] and a redeemer
[1:56:24] in other words like this i know you know
[1:56:27] this one
[1:56:28] i know you know this quote
[1:56:30] we was put in the devil's pawn shop
[1:56:39] the debt was
[1:56:40] owed you had a little bit of value
[1:56:46] not enough for the auction
[1:56:49] but enough for the pawn shop
[1:56:52] where people take their best junk
[1:56:58] the pawn shop
[1:57:00] and jesus walks in
[1:57:02] and pays the price and says to the devil
[1:57:05] you have no idea what's been sitting on
[1:57:07] your shelf
[1:57:11] all you saw was the dents and scratches
[1:57:14] all you saw was the warts and freckles
[1:57:17] you have no idea that that is the son of
[1:57:20] god that's been sitting there on your
[1:57:22] shelf and he is the most valuable thing
[1:57:24] in all of this pawn shop and today i'm
[1:57:29] making him mine
[1:57:32] and you never think of seeing him around
[1:57:34] here ever again
[1:57:37] we was put in the devil's pawn shop and
[1:57:39] jesus paid the price and brought us out
[1:57:48] just an old
[1:57:50] familiar relic
[1:57:53] on the auction block
[1:57:56] they decided
[1:57:59] to throw me
[1:58:01] away
[1:58:03] [Music]
[1:58:04] the auctioneer
[1:58:07] said who will take him
[1:58:09] the room was quiet and still
[1:58:14] then a stranger
[1:58:16] stepped forward and he
[1:58:20] said i will
[1:58:24] if you
[1:58:26] had known me
[1:58:30] before i knew him
[1:58:34] you'd
[1:58:35] understand why
[1:58:38] i love him
[1:58:42] if you
[1:58:44] had known me
[1:58:46] before
[1:58:48] i knew him
[1:58:51] you'd understand
[1:58:55] my
[1:58:56] love if you know it sing it if you
[1:59:01] had known me
[1:59:04] before i knew him
[1:59:08] you'd understand
[1:59:10] [Music]
[1:59:11] why
[1:59:13] i love him
[1:59:16] if you'd have known me
[1:59:22] before i knew him
[1:59:25] you'd understand
[1:59:29] my
[1:59:30] love
[1:59:32] [Music]
[1:59:33] who feels that way
[1:59:35] [Music]
[1:59:37] give him praise
[1:59:39] do it
[1:59:42] [Applause]
[1:59:45] now when jesus died at calvary
[1:59:48] he saved every
[1:59:51] sinner
[1:59:53] in the world
[1:59:57] or ever would be in the world
[2:00:01] as far as
[2:00:02] god
[2:00:04] was concerned
[2:00:07] how many of you know that's only part of
[2:00:09] the equation
[2:00:11] because the sinner has to make a choice
[2:00:14] and god already knew the sinner's choice
[2:00:16] but if you would have asked god if you
[2:00:18] could have had the privilege of
[2:00:20] interviewing god he would have said it
[2:00:23] is
[2:00:24] finished
[2:00:26] they're all saved
[2:00:28] they're all redeemed
[2:00:31] the prize has been paid for every one of
[2:00:34] them
[2:00:36] as far as god was concerned
[2:00:40] now you wasn't saved 10 years ago
[2:00:44] or two years ago
[2:00:46] or three years ago i wasn't saved 17
[2:00:50] years ago
[2:00:52] i was saved 2 000 years ago
[2:00:57] but i accepted it 17
[2:01:01] years ago
[2:01:03] he said now jesus didn't come down and
[2:01:05] die just for me or die just for you he
[2:01:08] settled
[2:01:10] the sin question
[2:01:12] but he'll never do us
[2:01:14] any good until we accept it
[2:01:18] it's your i want to know who accepts him
[2:01:20] this morning will you accept him as lord
[2:01:24] and savior and never turn your back from
[2:01:27] him ever again will you do that you
[2:01:30] watching this service right now will you
[2:01:32] with all the faith you have except him
[2:01:35] and his sacrifice on your behalf
[2:01:38] never to be lost again
[2:01:42] he said it's your accepting of him as
[2:01:44] your personal savior and it's by faith
[2:01:48] that you receive it and believe it
[2:01:51] he said in hebrews 3 1 the bible said
[2:01:54] that he's the high priest of our what
[2:01:59] what comes out of our mouth sister flo
[2:02:02] like you were prophesying exhorting us
[2:02:05] today
[2:02:06] now he's sitting at the right hand of
[2:02:09] the father to make intercessions for us
[2:02:18] you know he's only interceding on your
[2:02:20] confession
[2:02:24] oh yes
[2:02:25] he says it even plainer in other places
[2:02:28] he's only making intercession over what
[2:02:31] comes out of your mouth
[2:02:40] yes my my
[2:02:43] we covered that in the mind in the
[2:02:45] teaching the the the series on the mind
[2:02:48] where brother branham is very clear
[2:02:50] about our great intercessor the great
[2:02:53] high priest
[2:02:55] touched with the feeling of our
[2:02:56] infirmities whoever lives to make
[2:02:59] intercession for us brother branham said
[2:03:01] he's only the high priest of your
[2:03:04] confession
[2:03:07] so you better be careful my friend what
[2:03:10] you are confessing
[2:03:12] because that is what he bears before the
[2:03:15] father in your name
[2:03:24] so shauna was singing this morning
[2:03:26] about the battle
[2:03:29] the weariness of the battle
[2:03:34] and how that you get your eyes off of
[2:03:36] that
[2:03:38] and you begin to realize the authority
[2:03:40] that's been given to you
[2:03:42] by the atonement
[2:03:44] and here she is singing to us do what
[2:03:47] you got to do devil but you better know
[2:03:49] one thing
[2:03:52] you cannot cross
[2:03:55] this bloodline
[2:03:59] you see i can see the enemy on the other
[2:04:02] side of the bloodline
[2:04:04] [Music]
[2:04:06] growling at you
[2:04:08] mocking you harassing you
[2:04:12] but there's one thing for sure he cannot
[2:04:15] get any closer than the bloodline
[2:04:19] so you let the blood be your confession
[2:04:22] and you confess i'm on the inside
[2:04:25] i'm not on the outside where you are i'm
[2:04:28] on the inside sealed in here
[2:04:31] you remember the experience that i had
[2:04:34] many many many years ago
[2:04:36] where i was given caulking guns
[2:04:41] we were inside a house and the enemy was
[2:04:45] howling in the windows
[2:04:47] hideous faces
[2:04:50] hideous
[2:04:52] horrendous looking creatures and
[2:04:56] satan himself harassing
[2:04:59] and the door
[2:05:00] looked like the door was going to be
[2:05:03] knocked
[2:05:04] in and i was given these caulking guns
[2:05:10] and i looked down and somebody said well
[2:05:12] you know brother branham said there
[2:05:13] wasn't blood in a vision i'm not talking
[2:05:16] about your blood
[2:05:18] i'm not talking about my blood
[2:05:20] i'm talking about the blood of jesus
[2:05:23] christ and i've seen it more than once
[2:05:25] in a vision and i wouldn't dare back up
[2:05:28] on that not at all because he made it so
[2:05:31] real to me i saw the bloodbath on mount
[2:05:34] zion i saw that when the bride can't
[2:05:37] hardly go any higher you're going to
[2:05:39] receive a personal
[2:05:41] impartation we're going to understand
[2:05:44] the power that's in that blood in a way
[2:05:47] that we've never understood it before
[2:05:49] and begin to appropriate the life that
[2:05:52] is in that blood and overcome all things
[2:05:54] because of it you see we think we know
[2:05:56] all there is to know about the blood but
[2:05:58] god wants to make that so real to you
[2:06:01] and so personal to you a fresh
[2:06:03] revelation of that blood and i'm giving
[2:06:06] these caulking guns with the blood of
[2:06:08] jesus
[2:06:10] and we begin to seal the windows
[2:06:15] and go under the doors where you would
[2:06:17] normally block a draft and we are
[2:06:19] sealing under the doorway and the jam of
[2:06:23] the door we are sealing that up with the
[2:06:26] precious blood of jesus and you know
[2:06:29] what then we can just lay down and take
[2:06:31] a nap
[2:06:33] the blood doesn't cause him to quit
[2:06:35] roaring he will always roar he will
[2:06:39] always harass he will always lie and
[2:06:42] mock and try to distract you but what we
[2:06:45] do when we get a revelation of what the
[2:06:47] blood has accomplished on our behalf is
[2:06:50] we just take our rest
[2:06:53] it drives the devil insane
[2:06:58] did you know you can run him out of his
[2:07:00] head by just not listening to him
[2:07:02] anymore
[2:07:04] no fear
[2:07:07] no dread
[2:07:08] god's provided way of dealing with sin
[2:07:11] paragraph 38 and 39 are you still here
[2:07:14] oh it's just one o'clock
[2:07:17] we've got all day
[2:07:19] and i tell you
[2:07:21] jesus christ on calvary pulled the
[2:07:25] stinger out of death and sin amen
[2:07:33] and their sickness has no control
[2:07:36] anymore god's done suffered it in
[2:07:38] judgment anybody read that
[2:07:41] jesus took the stinger out of sin jesus
[2:07:45] took the stinger out of sickness jesus
[2:07:47] took the stinger off of satan
[2:07:54] he's a bee without a stinger
[2:07:56] so guess what he can do
[2:07:59] buzz
[2:08:12] [Music]
[2:08:14] hey
[2:08:15] buddy cannot sting you
[2:08:18] because jesus took out his bite
[2:08:22] jesus took out his sting
[2:08:25] sees
[2:08:26] as were you here tuesday night how many
[2:08:28] of you were here tuesday night how many
[2:08:30] of you heard the message from tuesday
[2:08:32] night you weren't here but you should
[2:08:33] hear it
[2:08:34] it was a rerun but you should go back
[2:08:36] and rerun it again
[2:08:37] you should hear it because it was fresh
[2:08:39] there was a fresh inspiration on it for
[2:08:41] the hour that we're living in right now
[2:08:44] i want you to know that old enemy is not
[2:08:46] a roaring lion he is like a roaring lion
[2:08:50] now i once heard them explain how how
[2:08:52] they deal with old lions
[2:08:56] brother aren't you from kenya
[2:08:59] he was if he would have been here
[2:09:00] tuesday night he would have been
[2:09:02] amending me
[2:09:05] but they tell me that that that these
[2:09:08] people who follow these lion prides
[2:09:10] around
[2:09:11] through the serengeti and all those
[2:09:13] different places
[2:09:15] they tell me that they have observed
[2:09:18] this from time to time
[2:09:20] that there will be an old
[2:09:23] daddy lion
[2:09:26] whose teeth are rotted out
[2:09:29] his voice is all gruff and
[2:09:32] he doesn't even have a
[2:09:34] uh a sharpness about him anymore his
[2:09:38] claws are are arthritic i guess
[2:09:42] and he
[2:09:44] couldn't take a little gazelle have you
[2:09:46] seen those little spring bucks
[2:09:49] you've seen those little antelope
[2:09:52] how fast they move
[2:09:55] you can't get an old lion who has
[2:09:58] trouble getting up in the morning
[2:10:00] you can't let him run out and chase the
[2:10:03] prey
[2:10:05] but he deserves to have a little bit of
[2:10:07] dignity i think
[2:10:09] and so they have found this several
[2:10:11] times
[2:10:12] in observing these lion prides there'll
[2:10:15] be a real alpha male who loses his alpha
[2:10:21] he's more like an alfalfa instead of an
[2:10:23] alpha
[2:10:27] you got the reference
[2:10:29] thank you
[2:10:31] and so
[2:10:32] so that he doesn't feel completely
[2:10:34] useless
[2:10:35] he goes up on a hill
[2:10:39] and the little young lions the ones that
[2:10:42] are agile and the ones that can catch
[2:10:44] the prey the young males they're down in
[2:10:46] the valley
[2:10:48] and when they see the herd of antelope
[2:10:50] passing through
[2:10:52] they let grandpa
[2:10:54] no teeth
[2:10:57] not much of a of a of a of claw but he
[2:11:00] still got a roar
[2:11:02] they let grandpa roar
[2:11:07] and oh the little spring buck and all
[2:11:10] the little antelope and gazelle whatever
[2:11:11] they are they all begin to do what
[2:11:14] run away
[2:11:15] from the roar
[2:11:19] and guess what happened the little young
[2:11:21] hunters
[2:11:23] the little young male hunting lions
[2:11:25] they're over there in the bush they're
[2:11:26] over there in the weed and so when those
[2:11:29] antelope when they run away from that
[2:11:31] roar the next thing you know they run
[2:11:33] right into the mouth of a hungry lion
[2:11:35] anybody follow my story i like my story
[2:11:39] you don't seem to be liking it like i
[2:11:41] like telling it
[2:11:43] so we have got to learn something
[2:11:46] we have to know the difference between
[2:11:48] the roar of the lion of judah and the
[2:11:51] roar of the imitator
[2:11:54] we've got to be able to discern the
[2:11:57] enemies will growl from the lion of the
[2:12:00] tribe of judah so that instead of
[2:12:02] running away from the buzzing of our
[2:12:04] enemy and running away from the
[2:12:06] hypocrite roar of our enemy we've got to
[2:12:08] run toward the roar
[2:12:09] did you know that if those little if
[2:12:11] those little bucks those little deer if
[2:12:13] they would just run toward the roar
[2:12:17] they'd overtake grandpa
[2:12:21] he couldn't gum him to death
[2:12:25] he's got to wait on the young ones to
[2:12:26] tear him a piece of something to eat
[2:12:28] they could run right past him and he
[2:12:30] might not be able to do one thing about
[2:12:31] it i want you to know your enemy has
[2:12:34] lost his teeth his stinger is gone all
[2:12:38] he's got left is his buzz or his roar
[2:12:41] depending on what analogy you're using
[2:12:43] here
[2:12:45] he said jesus took the stinger out of
[2:12:48] sin and tonight he's helpless
[2:12:51] hallelujah he can only bust
[2:12:55] and make a lot of
[2:12:57] fuss
[2:12:59] ezekiel joseph
[2:13:03] ezekiel
[2:13:05] ezekiel
[2:13:09] he can only bus
[2:13:11] and make a lot of fuss
[2:13:14] but read the rest he's
[2:13:16] got
[2:13:19] he's got no
[2:13:21] stinger
[2:13:24] jesus has taken care of him
[2:13:26] paul said oh death
[2:13:29] where is your sting
[2:13:32] grave where is your victory but thanks
[2:13:35] be to god who gives us the victory
[2:13:37] through our lord jesus christ amen amen
[2:13:41] amen he pulled the stinger out
[2:13:47] 49 and thy seed shall possess the gate
[2:13:50] of the enemy of his enemy let's read
[2:13:53] this one he said then when he died down
[2:13:55] at the cross hell taken his precious
[2:13:58] soul the bible said his soul descended
[2:14:01] into hell
[2:14:03] that's exactly right hell captured his
[2:14:07] soul
[2:14:08] and took him down there
[2:14:11] anybody thought of it quite like that
[2:14:14] it's pretty interesting way of putting
[2:14:16] it isn't it
[2:14:17] but brother
[2:14:19] on that third
[2:14:22] day
[2:14:23] he possessed
[2:14:25] the gates of death hell and the grave
[2:14:29] and rose up the third day and overcame
[2:14:34] it all
[2:14:35] he took sickness death hell the grave
[2:14:39] and
[2:14:41] everything
[2:14:42] praise god
[2:14:46] praise god
[2:14:50] i believe he jerked the gate plum off
[2:14:53] the hinges
[2:14:55] he took them out rose on high ascended
[2:14:59] on high and tonight oh hallelujah hell i
[2:15:02] don't care i don't even care right now
[2:15:05] whether you feel like a conqueror or not
[2:15:07] because we are not talking about your
[2:15:09] feelings
[2:15:11] [Applause]
[2:15:18] we're not talking about a mama
[2:15:21] who's cried all night
[2:15:23] because of a crying baby
[2:15:26] that she can heal
[2:15:28] we're talking about a mama who can stand
[2:15:31] up here today and sing
[2:15:38] she might not have felt like a conqueror
[2:15:41] last night but when she was standing
[2:15:43] here this morning she was a conqueror
[2:15:48] it's not about our feelings
[2:15:51] it's about the truth of the word
[2:15:54] we are not just conquerors
[2:15:59] you want to hear that one
[2:16:02] i got another illustration i will use
[2:16:04] them all in one sermon i don't have many
[2:16:08] once upon a time there was a boxer
[2:16:13] and he loved the box
[2:16:16] and he had a wife that loved
[2:16:19] for him to box
[2:16:23] odd isn't it
[2:16:24] you think she'd cherish his brain cells
[2:16:28] but the problem was she cherished his
[2:16:30] paycheck
[2:16:34] i'm not going with you tonight honey
[2:16:36] but knock him out
[2:16:39] she goes upstairs
[2:16:41] in their beautiful home that knockout
[2:16:43] money has purchased
[2:16:45] she puts on fuzzy slippers
[2:16:49] silk pajamas
[2:16:51] nice
[2:16:53] chanel robe
[2:16:56] she crawls up in the middle of a big old
[2:16:58] king-sized bed
[2:17:00] she takes out the remote
[2:17:04] she flips on the television
[2:17:08] to get her a good view
[2:17:11] of her husband
[2:17:12] when he knocks out the enemy
[2:17:15] he goes over there he's trained for days
[2:17:18] and months
[2:17:20] he has trained so hard to keep up on his
[2:17:23] game
[2:17:24] to know
[2:17:25] uh what to do and he has to anticipate
[2:17:30] where the enemy is going to punch next
[2:17:34] so that he can figure out how to dodge
[2:17:37] and
[2:17:38] whiz and all the things they do to be
[2:17:40] able to win the victory and oh it gets
[2:17:43] serious in their blood flies
[2:17:46] spit goes out
[2:17:48] somebody's tooth lays over there in the
[2:17:50] ring
[2:17:52] you can see them how they do i've only
[2:17:54] seen
[2:17:55] one or two boxing matches in my life
[2:17:58] so i may not be doing it justice
[2:18:01] but there is really something to watch
[2:18:03] when they go
[2:18:08] they are striving for consciousness
[2:18:11] they are they know that there is a lot
[2:18:13] of money at stake
[2:18:15] some of them millions of dollars i guess
[2:18:18] lots of money anyway
[2:18:20] and uh she she she has her bowl of
[2:18:23] popcorn
[2:18:26] she's drinking sweet tea
[2:18:28] she's from the south
[2:18:30] she's drinking sweet tea she's eating
[2:18:32] her popcorn
[2:18:34] he is in the fight of his life
[2:18:37] he did not anticipate his enemy to be as
[2:18:39] strong as he is he has took some serious
[2:18:42] punches to the cheeks to the jaw to the
[2:18:45] forehead to the nose
[2:18:47] he is bleeding

[2:19:34] they celebrate his victory

[2:23:23] more than conquerors hallelujah because
[2:23:26] he what
[2:23:28] oh we would never know what the true
[2:23:30] seed of abraham was what it really meant
[2:23:32] to us we wouldn't really understand it
[2:23:34] without this revelation
[2:23:37] god providing healing for this
[2:23:38] generation paragraph 29 the devil put us
[2:23:41] in the pawnshop but jesus redeemed us
[2:23:43] he's our kinsmen redeemer god made flesh
[2:23:45] kinfolks to us in order to redeem us
[2:23:47] from the curse of sin and sickness
[2:23:49] tonight has sent the holy spirit to
[2:23:51] dwell with the church and show signs and
[2:23:53] wonders of healing and salvation until
[2:23:55] he returns again
[2:23:57] are you still with me good i got two
[2:23:59] more i want to read
[2:24:01] but the first thing this is uh the
[2:24:03] breach between the church ages and the
[2:24:05] seals paragraph 301
[2:24:08] and this is something you need to
[2:24:09] understand and get a hold of it today
[2:24:12] while we're here
[2:24:13] don't let this pass you by
[2:24:15] paragraph 301 of the breach but the
[2:24:18] first thing that represented that
[2:24:20] redemption come the lamb that had been
[2:24:23] slain from the foundation of the
[2:24:26] world
[2:24:28] so i would just like to humbly say
[2:24:30] that your salvation's price was paid
[2:24:34] and actuated in the earth
[2:24:37] around 2000 years ago but i would just
[2:24:39] like to humbly suggest to what he said
[2:24:41] in other places and that is that your
[2:24:44] redemption goes all the way back to the
[2:24:46] foundation of the world you didn't get
[2:24:48] saved 10 years ago
[2:24:50] your redemption was purchased for you
[2:24:52] before the worlds were ever framed when
[2:24:54] a lamb was slain in the mind of god
[2:24:57] aren't you glad for that understanding
[2:24:59] the first thing that represented that
[2:25:01] redemption come the lamb that had been
[2:25:02] slain from the foundation of the world
[2:25:04] he took the book glory
[2:25:06] he opened the book
[2:25:08] tore off the seals
[2:25:10] and sent it down this is it you're
[2:25:14] following the book yes
[2:25:17] where did it start
[2:25:18] it started in the hands of god
[2:25:21] who did god entrust it to adam
[2:25:24] what did adam do forfeited it where did
[2:25:26] it go
[2:25:28] back to the hands of the original owner
[2:25:31] but something has to happen
[2:25:33] because between revelation 5 and
[2:25:35] revelation 10 something has happened to
[2:25:37] the book
[2:25:39] in revelation 5 the book is still there
[2:25:42] sealed with seven seals
[2:25:44] in revelation 10 he comes down and what
[2:25:46] does he have in his hand
[2:25:49] a book that's no longer sealed
[2:25:54] that's why tabernacles is so precious to
[2:25:57] us
[2:25:58] because tabernacles is the feast of the
[2:26:00] open book
[2:26:03] this is the feast that celebrates the
[2:26:05] fact that the book is open
[2:26:08] and all who desire
[2:26:10] by god's elective
[2:26:13] can
[2:26:14] look in
[2:26:15] and see what john saw
[2:26:18] the revelation of their part of the
[2:26:20] redemptive plan of god
[2:26:22] he took the book glory opened the book
[2:26:25] and tore off the seals and what did you
[2:26:27] do with it now you're still following it
[2:26:28] right
[2:26:30] and sent it down to the earth
[2:26:34] now i know this will be a little chokey
[2:26:36] for some
[2:26:39] and he sent it down to the earth to his
[2:26:42] seventh angel
[2:26:44] to reveal it to the people
[2:26:50] amen
[2:26:54] now whether you're one of those who
[2:26:56] believes that brother branham was that
[2:26:58] seventh angel
[2:27:00] or whether you believe like i believe
[2:27:03] he was the messenger of that angel
[2:27:09] he was the earthly messenger
[2:27:11] of a heavenly angel
[2:27:13] somebody said why in the world would you
[2:27:14] say it like that because there are some
[2:27:16] other places there that you can't
[2:27:18] reconcile
[2:27:22] because that seventh angel is to be in
[2:27:24] the earth
[2:27:26] at the time of the second coming
[2:27:29] is that right
[2:27:31] amen so when when he has this glorious
[2:27:34] visitation of which we believe and
[2:27:36] wholeheartedly embrace
[2:27:39] that that what god had shown him
[2:27:41] previously it now begins to unfold in
[2:27:44] the arizona desert
[2:27:46] and he sees those little birds wait no
[2:27:48] they're not they're angels
[2:27:50] and he sees them coming in a
[2:27:52] constellation and they and they come
[2:27:54] right down to where he is standing
[2:27:58] and as he is looking on those angels
[2:28:03] a messenger
[2:28:05] you're with me
[2:28:07] is looking on those angels
[2:28:10] he sees them now i know there are some
[2:28:13] who say things like those were
[2:28:15] theophanies
[2:28:17] then the bible word is wrong the bible
[2:28:19] then the scripture is wrong because the
[2:28:21] bible didn't call them theophanies
[2:28:23] the bible calls them angels brother
[2:28:25] branham said an angel is a male
[2:28:27] messenger he says but the the truest
[2:28:29] definition of an angel is a messenger
[2:28:32] either of the earth or of the heavens
[2:28:35] we're just looking at it from the
[2:28:36] original language so here he stands a
[2:28:39] mouthpiece a prophet one who has the
[2:28:42] anointing
[2:28:44] and the call of the elijah spirit
[2:28:48] it's on him he is not elijah
[2:28:53] but the spirit and power of elijah has
[2:28:56] fallen on him
[2:28:57] amen and you know what i preach we need
[2:29:00] it to fall on us
[2:29:02] because it's a no compromise no nonsense
[2:29:06] anointing and we need a no compromise no
[2:29:09] nonsense anointing to overcome in
[2:29:12] satan's eden
[2:29:13] we need that i didn't mean to get into
[2:29:15] this
[2:29:19] but here he stands a messenger
[2:29:21] upon whom this the very uh and a a
[2:29:24] prophet of a of a biblical proportion
[2:29:28] because his ministry is prophesied about
[2:29:30] in the bible
[2:29:33] come on now
[2:29:35] i know when they're trying sometime to
[2:29:37] figure out who he is
[2:29:39] they say things like an old testament
[2:29:42] prophet then what is he doing in the new
[2:29:45] covenant
[2:29:49] it's really quiet
[2:29:51] i hear people saying things like he was
[2:29:53] a prophet of the old testament order
[2:29:55] then he came out of the covenant
[2:29:59] all you have to say is that he came with
[2:30:02] a ministry that was prophesied in
[2:30:04] scripture that makes him a biblical
[2:30:06] prophet
[2:30:07] it makes him a prophet with a biblical
[2:30:09] calling and commission
[2:30:11] it makes him more than a five-fold
[2:30:13] prophet
[2:30:15] of which there are still five full
[2:30:17] prophets in the earth in this hour
[2:30:20] as well as fivefold apostles pastors
[2:30:23] teachers and evangelists we need them
[2:30:25] all
[2:30:27] but they are not they don't have the
[2:30:29] same prophesied ministry that he had he
[2:30:31] is standing there looking at these
[2:30:34] angels
[2:30:35] and he says that one on my left
[2:30:39] did he say left or right
[2:30:41] i don't remember either
[2:30:44] meant more to me
[2:30:49] can we find that
[2:30:55] it escaped me
[2:30:57] i know that people watching this are
[2:30:59] saying it's this it's left it says right
[2:31:01] it's right
[2:31:01] left i thought it was
[2:31:04] that one on the left
[2:31:06] meant more to me
[2:31:08] can you give me the exact wording
[2:31:13] paragraph 275 of the fourth seal is that
[2:31:16] right no no seventh seal all right
[2:31:19] what does it
[2:31:26] say they were in a constellation
[2:31:29] be on a
[2:31:31] side and one on top
[2:31:33] one
[2:31:34] right next to me here counting from the
[2:31:36] left to the right would have been the
[2:31:38] seventh
[2:31:44] brighter
[2:31:45] meant more to me
[2:31:47] why
[2:31:48] because that was the angel that brother
[2:31:50] branham was representing on the earth
[2:31:54] now if you look that up in context with
[2:31:57] what we now know about the day this
[2:31:59] happened
[2:32:01] and the fact that the cloud was not even
[2:32:03] on the same day
[2:32:06] if you look that up then you'll come to
[2:32:08] the conclusion that brother greene came
[2:32:09] to
[2:32:11] when he said that brother branham told
[2:32:13] him
[2:32:14] that those angels lingered there in that
[2:32:18] desert
[2:32:20] and brother greene liked to point out
[2:32:22] the sighting of the russian cosmonauts
[2:32:26] who saw these angels and many felt like
[2:32:29] that they were catching a glimpse
[2:32:32] of this very very prophetic happening
[2:32:35] that had taken place there in that
[2:32:37] desert now why are you taking time to go
[2:32:40] into all of that because i believe it's
[2:32:43] very important to understand that the
[2:32:46] hand that the book went from the hand of
[2:32:49] god to the hand of adam to the hand of
[2:32:52] god
[2:32:54] to the hand of christ
[2:32:57] to the hand of a seventh angel
[2:33:00] give me the quote
[2:33:03] go back to where we were he took the
[2:33:06] book glory opened the book see
[2:33:09] he took the lamb
[2:33:11] so jesus had already done something with
[2:33:13] this book by the time it got to the
[2:33:15] seventh angel
[2:33:17] to reveal it to his people
[2:33:19] don't you ever be guilty of saying that
[2:33:21] brother branham opened the seals
[2:33:23] if he opened the seals the scriptures
[2:33:25] out of catered and we can't follow it
[2:33:27] anymore amen the lamb opened the seals
[2:33:30] brother branham was the one who caught
[2:33:32] the revelation of what was underneath
[2:33:34] those seals thank god he did
[2:33:37] thank god he did thank god that the
[2:33:39] seventh angel messenger caught the
[2:33:41] revelation
[2:33:43] and he began to do what
[2:33:45] to reveal it to
[2:33:51] that his is not a they didn't choose to
[2:33:54] put a small h
[2:33:56] which would mean a people of the angel
[2:34:00] they chose to put a capital h
[2:34:07] to his people
[2:34:09] now there is the there is the journey of
[2:34:12] the book
[2:34:16] anybody got it in your hand today
[2:34:20] you got it
[2:34:22] you got it let's do it again
[2:34:24] god the original
[2:34:26] gave it to adam adam forfeited it went
[2:34:28] back to the hands of the original owner
[2:34:31] the lamb took the book
[2:34:35] didn't it say the lamb took the book
[2:34:37] from him who sat on the throne
[2:34:40] john braced himself to see a lion
[2:34:43] but instead of a lion here came a bloody
[2:34:45] lamb
[2:34:46] the lamb took the book out of the hand
[2:34:49] of him that sat on the throne
[2:34:51] which symbolizes the original owner
[2:34:55] and the lamb took the book and opened
[2:34:58] the seals thereof
[2:35:00] sent it down by the seventh angel
[2:35:02] revelation 10.
[2:35:04] sent it down open book
[2:35:08] seal's torn off
[2:35:10] and he sends that book down to the
[2:35:12] seventh angel messenger who has the
[2:35:13] revelation of what was underneath those
[2:35:16] seals we've studied them here before so
[2:35:18] that that truth may be revealed to the
[2:35:20] people and the reason why the bride had
[2:35:22] to have the revelation of what was
[2:35:24] underneath those seals is it was a
[2:35:26] transfer of authority
[2:35:30] amen
[2:35:32] amen
[2:35:33] sad
[2:35:36] come on
[2:35:39] you now have
[2:35:41] the authority that's been granted
[2:35:43] in the opening of those seals
[2:35:46] we are walking in that authority we may
[2:35:48] not be exercising it but we're walking
[2:35:50] in the potentials of it it's in us
[2:35:52] it's in us this is the whole journey
[2:35:54] you've got to take it all the way all
[2:35:56] the way
[2:35:57] you took the book let's go ahead and
[2:35:59] finish that one
[2:36:02] congregate oh my my my brother brandon i
[2:36:04] couldn't get mine to greatly rejoice
[2:36:06] this morning about it

[2:36:14] hallelujahs the anointed the power the
[2:36:17] glory the manifestation
[2:36:21] can anybody read the brackets
[2:36:23] congregation continues to greatly
[2:36:26] rejoice
[2:36:29] because we now know who we are
[2:36:32] our destiny was revealed under those
[2:36:36] seals
[2:36:38] we had to know what this plan of
[2:36:40] redemption is all about
[2:36:42] total restoration that brings
[2:36:44] restitution all the way back
[2:36:47] and old john who had been standing there
[2:36:49] our brother crying why he said
[2:36:52] everything in heaven everything in the
[2:36:53] earth and everything in the sea heard
[2:36:55] him holler amen amen blessings honor and

[2:37:10] all the way through 10. john must have
[2:37:12] looked in and seen a past the curtain of
[2:37:15] time and said there is john
[2:37:18] saw his name in the plan
[2:37:21] of redemption oh that god would anoint
[2:37:24] your eyes
[2:37:25] and my eyes today that we could look
[2:37:28] behind the veil and see our name written
[2:37:31] there in that plan of redemption brother
[2:37:34] if you could catch a revelation of that
[2:37:36] there's not enough demons in the
[2:37:38] underworld to talk you out of who you
[2:37:40] are in christ there's not a sickness
[2:37:43] broad enough
[2:37:45] there's not a trial hard enough to talk
[2:37:48] you out of who you are in christ once
[2:37:50] you know your name is there and brother
[2:37:52] you're looking at somebody who knows

[2:38:01] one for this morning
[2:38:03] we're going to close just a tad
[2:38:08] earlier
[2:38:10] paragraph 99 of the easter seal
[2:38:13] he said they're led by the spirit
[2:38:16] to quicken the word to you who is
[2:38:19] believers
[2:38:20] the word keeps quickening
[2:38:24] how many of you have had a quickening in
[2:38:26] the word
[2:38:27] as you come to the first limb the second
[2:38:29] limb the third limb on up
[2:38:35] i hear the cathedral singing about the
[2:38:37] latter
[2:38:41] we're still moving up higher higher
[2:38:42] higher
[2:38:43] he said it just keeps quickening the
[2:38:45] spirit of god keeps quickening to you
[2:38:47] are you still here
[2:38:49] notice that pentecost their bodies were
[2:38:51] quickened by the new life they received
[2:38:54] he said that makes me feel religious
[2:38:56] think now here was men fishermen
[2:38:59] tax collectors
[2:39:01] the humble little woman and just
[2:39:03] ordinary housewives little virgin girls
[2:39:05] they were believers they were believing
[2:39:07] that this was the truth
[2:39:09] they believed that when jesus died they
[2:39:11] believed on him and rose up again from
[2:39:13] the dead they believed that to be the
[2:39:15] absolutely testimony of god that he hath
[2:39:18] quickened
[2:39:19] him
[2:39:20] to
[2:39:21] life
[2:39:23] he said now they go up to the day of
[2:39:24] pentecost to receive their
[2:39:27] abstract do you know what an abstract is
[2:39:30] he said it's when a deed has been
[2:39:31] cleared
[2:39:33] oh my
[2:39:34] oh my
[2:39:35] oh my do you know you've got a free
[2:39:38] and clear
[2:39:40] title
[2:39:43] been cleared all the way back to adam
[2:39:46] he said and they become quickened or
[2:39:48] what a thrill they had bought the land
[2:39:52] been bought for them
[2:39:54] more than conquerors
[2:39:55] they had done what
[2:39:59] received it
[2:40:01] will you receive it
[2:40:04] will you receive it how many of you are
[2:40:05] with me
[2:40:07] all right now listen
[2:40:10] i came to you on resurrection sunday
[2:40:14] are you with me
[2:40:16] and and i give you a verse song of
[2:40:18] solomon i want to do it again song of
[2:40:20] solomon chapter 2
[2:40:22] verse 10 through 12 my beloved spoke
[2:40:25] and said to me rise up my love my fair
[2:40:27] one and come away
[2:40:28] for lo the winter is past
[2:40:31] the rain is over and gone
[2:40:33] the flowers appear on the earth the time
[2:40:36] of the singing of birds has come and the
[2:40:38] voice of the turtle is heard in our land
[2:40:42] i brought you a quote do you remember
[2:40:44] from wade taylor
[2:40:48] let me explain this to you if you search
[2:40:51] the life
[2:40:52] of wade taylor
[2:40:54] you're going to find out that he had a
[2:40:55] fall
[2:40:58] you're going to find out that he made a
[2:41:00] grave mistake
[2:41:02] and it cost him something in his life
[2:41:04] and his ministry
[2:41:05] but god redeemed him
[2:41:09] all he had to do was come and say papa
[2:41:11] help me have mercy on me forgive me
[2:41:13] sinner saved by grace
[2:41:16] i didn't have to say that but i happen
[2:41:18] to know it i didn't mention it the other
[2:41:19] time
[2:41:21] i never got to meet wade taylor face to
[2:41:23] face
[2:41:24] but he reached out to me in email
[2:41:27] when when he had ran across some of my
[2:41:29] experiences in the spirit online he
[2:41:31] reached out to me
[2:41:33] and he said stephen i want to i want to
[2:41:35] hear more will you send me more
[2:41:38] and he actually had
[2:41:40] at his death
[2:41:43] about a 300-page document
[2:41:47] of of my experiences that i've had
[2:41:49] through the years in the spirit
[2:41:51] and from time to time he would come to
[2:41:53] one and he would write me and he would
[2:41:54] say i can't tell you how this ministered
[2:41:57] to me i can't tell you how this was on
[2:41:59] time for me as he began to write the
[2:42:01] books that he wrote
[2:42:04] i would think the last one was the
[2:42:06] secret of the stairs it was published in
[2:42:08] 2013. he passed away a few years after
[2:42:11] that but he was a human and he made
[2:42:13] mistakes
[2:42:15] you were here some of you were here when
[2:42:18] we had some other great speakers come
[2:42:19] through here from other realms from
[2:42:21] other other uh
[2:42:24] camps
[2:42:26] these were not perfect men some of them
[2:42:28] had fallen
[2:42:31] some of them had made big mistakes
[2:42:34] the one who was one of the most popular
[2:42:36] among them who has now gone to be with
[2:42:38] the lord he had some big falls
[2:42:41] big mistakes
[2:42:43] lost churches
[2:42:45] human beings
[2:42:47] sinners saved by grace
[2:42:49] let me tell you something you don't know
[2:42:51] how to fully appreciate the redemptive
[2:42:53] work of the cross until you need it
[2:42:58] i don't embrace jimmy swaggart's
[2:43:00] theology
[2:43:01] but i will tell you this
[2:43:04] he preaches the cross
[2:43:06] because if anybody publicly needed the
[2:43:08] cross
[2:43:09] he needed it
[2:43:18] nobody can sing the song
[2:43:21] like he can sing it
[2:43:23] let the blood of calvary speak for me
[2:43:26] let it write me down as righteous
[2:43:29] where no righteousness has been
[2:43:32] shielding me from wrath and judgment as
[2:43:35] it covers all my sin there is no good
[2:43:38] that i've accomplished nothing no deed
[2:43:40] that i've accomplished nothing good
[2:43:43] that i've done
[2:43:44] just let the blood of calvary speak for
[2:43:47] me
[2:43:51] so i honor that
[2:43:53] i respect the man's
[2:43:54] i i heard how they mocked it
[2:43:58] but it wasn't up to up to the church
[2:44:02] and it wasn't up to the media
[2:44:05] it was up to god
[2:44:08] and if god hasn't accepted his
[2:44:10] repentance it's not too late there's
[2:44:12] still breath in his body
[2:44:14] so if i wanted to mention jimmy swaggart
[2:44:17] in the pulpit it's none of anybody's
[2:44:19] business
[2:44:20] because if you want me to get personal i
[2:44:22] can name preachers among us
[2:44:27] i know message preachers that had
[2:44:28] affairs on their wives children out of
[2:44:31] wedlock i know them
[2:44:37] sons raised by women
[2:44:40] grown now
[2:44:42] probably my age
[2:44:44] sons
[2:44:46] but if they have come to god
[2:44:49] fully repented
[2:44:52] then i receive
[2:44:54] this great grace
[2:44:56] for myself
[2:44:59] and i can honor that they believe that
[2:45:00] god has forgiven them and given them
[2:45:02] mercy it may dictate their future in
[2:45:04] ministry
[2:45:08] because i do not believe in double
[2:45:10] married preachers in the pulpit i do not
[2:45:12] believe in that it may change
[2:45:15] the course of their ministry
[2:45:18] but they can be right with god if
[2:45:19] they've made it right
[2:45:22] so i quoted from my from my from from a
[2:45:24] mentor a precious man
[2:45:27] the bride has made a major breakthrough
[2:45:30] the winter is past and the flowers are
[2:45:32] beginning to appear a spiritual winter
[2:45:34] is a time in which the lord is seemingly
[2:45:37] absent and we feel little or no
[2:45:39] quickening presence
[2:45:40] the primary purpose of a winter season
[2:45:43] is to cause us to seek something further
[2:45:45] rather than remaining content with our
[2:45:48] past spiritual accomplishments he said
[2:45:51] during this time of winter we may not be
[2:45:53] aware that the lord is patiently waiting
[2:45:55] without but actively looking
[2:45:59] within
[2:46:00] oh church hear me now
[2:46:02] i need you
[2:46:04] that is so precious to me
[2:46:06] and then i quoted c.s lewis
[2:46:17] wrong will be right
[2:46:19] when aslan comes
[2:46:21] in sight
[2:46:23] at the sound of his roar sorrows will be
[2:46:25] no more when he bears his teeth winter
[2:46:27] meets its death and when he shakes his
[2:46:30] mane we shall have spring
[2:46:33] again
[2:46:36] now let me give you this disclaimer
[2:46:38] because i don't ever intend to ever do
[2:46:40] it again
[2:46:41] so you listen carefully
[2:46:44] brother branham told us
[2:46:47] that martin luther
[2:46:50] was a church age messenger
[2:46:53] to his day
[2:46:57] and god gave him the revelation the just
[2:47:01] shall live by faith
[2:47:04] martin luther was baptized in the name
[2:47:05] of the father and of the son and of the
[2:47:07] holy ghost
[2:47:10] martin luther was a beer drinker
[2:47:14] and martin luther believed that all jews
[2:47:17] should be damned
[2:47:20] for their part in the crucifixion of
[2:47:22] jesus christ his direct words are
[2:47:26] all christ haters
[2:47:28] be damned
[2:47:30] and he speaks about the jews and their
[2:47:33] role in the crucifixion of jesus christ
[2:47:35] which was certainly a part of even
[2:47:38] catholic theology in those days that
[2:47:40] they had forfeited their opportunity for
[2:47:42] deliverance
[2:47:44] we all know better
[2:47:47] so when we preach about martin luther
[2:47:49] we're not preaching about his messes
[2:47:52] or his misses
[2:47:55] we're not telling you that everything
[2:47:57] that come out of his mouth was
[2:47:58] theologically sound hey i gotta tell you
[2:48:00] a secret
[2:48:02] i've said some pretty stupid things
[2:48:04] before
[2:48:08] i i've said some pretty dumb things up
[2:48:10] here
[2:48:12] that had to backpedal
[2:48:15] straighten out correct a little bit
[2:48:17] anybody understand how that works
[2:48:20] so make sure that everybody under the
[2:48:22] sound of my voice knows because there
[2:48:25] was a big misunderstanding with some
[2:48:28] i am not here to raise up the life
[2:48:32] of c.s lewis
[2:48:37] i just know how god used
[2:48:40] certain things that he did
[2:48:42] said
[2:48:44] film that was made
[2:48:46] to do something really powerful for me
[2:48:50] if there's one thing i hate look at me
[2:48:53] i cannot stand a religious spirit
[2:48:59] and i ought to be an expert on on them
[2:49:02] because i had one for a long time
[2:49:06] and if you've been under the influence
[2:49:08] of a religious spirit you're you ought
[2:49:10] to have a little a little bit of uh
[2:49:12] history here to help you find one
[2:49:17] now i don't like how the enemy twists
[2:49:19] things
[2:49:21] and takes something that god was
[2:49:22] inspiring and doing and twist that so
[2:49:25] it's been told that i was
[2:49:27] up here quoting from a witchcraft book
[2:49:31] and little kids have told little kids in
[2:49:33] our church that i was up here preaching
[2:49:36] from a witchcraft book well i want you
[2:49:37] to know that's a lie
[2:49:40] i want you to know i don't agree with a
[2:49:42] lot of c.s lewis's theology
[2:49:45] or all of his analogies
[2:49:48] but all i know is if we can't let
[2:49:51] somebody say something good and
[2:49:54] celebrate the good
[2:49:58] so they sent me a video of
[2:50:00] of this guy who was who was preaching or
[2:50:03] teaching or railing really it was
[2:50:06] railing with a religious spirit
[2:50:09] and that's what i said to the person who
[2:50:11] i finally got it traced it down to where
[2:50:13] it come from i said this man is so
[2:50:16] religious
[2:50:20] this is the very kind of person who
[2:50:23] would be doing the same videos against
[2:50:26] brother branham
[2:50:28] now don't expect me to sit here and
[2:50:30] listen to this guy talk about something
[2:50:31] i tr i even took some of the
[2:50:34] quotes and checked them out and found
[2:50:37] yes indeed
[2:50:39] some of the things he said were said
[2:50:43] but we ought to give somebody the right
[2:50:45] of context
[2:50:47] amen you should at least read the
[2:50:50] context of where that was said how many
[2:50:52] of you know you can take things well
[2:50:58] so i have decided to move in an opposite
[2:51:00] spirit of that religious
[2:51:02] spirit and i've decided today to play
[2:51:05] you a clip
[2:51:10] because i want you not to miss
[2:51:15] the inspiration of this moment
[2:51:18] he took me and let me see in a dream
[2:51:23] a frozen
[2:51:25] moment
[2:51:26] in our lives
[2:51:28] a dark
[2:51:30] death-filled winter
[2:51:35] and under the fire
[2:51:38] of the breath of jesus christ
[2:51:42] in this experience i saw him breathing
[2:51:47] and
[2:51:48] we were unfrozen
[2:51:51] and let me tell you something this may
[2:51:52] gross you out
[2:51:54] then we begin to breathe on others
[2:52:00] and they begin to get unstuck
[2:52:03] remember what the bible said jesus
[2:52:07] breathed on the ummah
[2:52:15] they have lots to say about benny hen
[2:52:17] because he used to breathe on people
[2:52:22] i try to use breath mints
[2:52:25] but on occasion if you've been around
[2:52:27] long enough
[2:52:31] you've seen me lean in
[2:52:33] not make something big to do like benny
[2:52:35] hen would do but you've seen me lean in
[2:52:37] on people too
[2:52:38] and go
[2:52:42] well i don't get that
[2:52:44] let me tell you something if we all
[2:52:45] ministered the same and flowed the same
[2:52:48] and worship as i i caught myself in
[2:52:50] circles today
[2:52:52] i caught myself moving in circles
[2:52:56] and i didn't even realize i was moving
[2:52:58] in circles until i realized everything
[2:53:00] was moving
[2:53:01] i'm not going to apologize for the way
[2:53:04] the spirit moves on me
[2:53:08] i was born an intercessor
[2:53:12] who happens to be a preacher
[2:53:15] with some other callings in my life
[2:53:17] but the highest honor that i have in the
[2:53:20] kingdom is that he made me an
[2:53:22] intercessor to pray
[2:53:25] to release
[2:53:27] to bind what needs to be bound and loose
[2:53:29] what needs to be loose
[2:53:32] so i see some frozen people in my life
[2:53:36] stuck they don't want to be stuck
[2:53:40] but they are
[2:53:42] and they need to be set free
[2:53:47] nobody minded
[2:53:48] when i played the clip of the kendrick
[2:53:50] brothers in the movies that they make
[2:53:53] they're trinitarians as far as i know
[2:53:56] but i respect what they have done
[2:53:59] nobody's bothered by that
[2:54:01] so you really shouldn't get in such a
[2:54:03] wad
[2:54:10] and you that has video games
[2:54:12] in snapchat
[2:54:14] [Music]
[2:54:17] all that stuff that disney's cranking
[2:54:19] out now
[2:54:23] please let's not be religiously fanatic
[2:54:27] let me tell you something i was just
[2:54:29] recently playing with children's toys
[2:54:36] and i found myself talking to little
[2:54:38] children
[2:54:40] luke
[2:54:41] i hope i made some questions for you to
[2:54:42] have to answer
[2:54:44] because i did not even think about it it
[2:54:47] it never really crossed my mind what i
[2:54:50] was saying to these children but but i
[2:54:52] was explaining to to them that i have
[2:54:55] seen this in the spirit not in the
[2:54:57] natural
[2:54:58] but in the spirit realm
[2:55:00] i fought this
[2:55:04] and it was a pterodactyl
[2:55:07] which is a it's a the image that we have
[2:55:10] of a dinosaur bird
[2:55:12] and in the natural i'm not saying that
[2:55:14] that represents anything evil
[2:55:17] but in the spiritual
[2:55:20] it almost cost me my life
[2:55:23] i know this is over some of your pay
[2:55:28] grade so that is startling to me
[2:55:33] but i understand that in the natural
[2:55:36] it's one thing in the spiritual it
[2:55:38] represented another
[2:55:39] i have dealt in deliverance with spirits
[2:55:42] that live on land and that live on sea
[2:55:48] demons that that work in the land and
[2:55:51] demons that work beneath this water
[2:55:55] and i have stories to tell that can't
[2:55:58] really be told
[2:56:01] so just remember that there are times
[2:56:04] that things remind you and
[2:56:06] and and you hear sounds
[2:56:08] that remind you of wars that you fought
[2:56:11] in the spiritual realm and it's very
[2:56:13] very real to me and i tried to teach my
[2:56:16] children that these things were real
[2:56:18] how many of you know i did
[2:56:20] because they're over there telling the
[2:56:22] neighbor last night my daddy wrestled
[2:56:24] the devil to the ground and killed him
[2:56:26] in the hallway
[2:56:28] and the neighbor says well that would
[2:56:30] ruin your night
[2:56:34] because we talked about those things as
[2:56:37] though they
[2:56:38] were
[2:56:40] because they are
[2:56:43] so this scene had such an impact on me
[2:56:48] that i want to share it with you
[2:56:52] and don't mind me if you see me watching
[2:56:54] your face
[2:56:55] cause i want to see what we can stir up
[2:57:02] i've showed a mel gibson clip
[2:57:06] and it wasn't from the passion of christ
[2:57:11] it was from one of the greatest movies
[2:57:12] of all times
[2:57:14] and i'm not a big movie watcher
[2:57:18] and someone sent me someone who quoted
[2:57:21] this sister kathy sent me something just
[2:57:24] recently when we were having such a cry
[2:57:27] here in the spirit she said it reminded
[2:57:28] her of that scene with the flash freedom
[2:57:34] you just take it and take it and take it
[2:57:36] till you can't take it no more and you
[2:57:39] rise out and say enough
[2:57:42] it's enough is it now
[2:57:45] is it now
[2:57:47] [Applause]
[2:57:49] i don't want to die in the winter
[2:57:53] i want to see my springtime
[2:57:55] [Music]
[2:57:57] all right
[2:58:01] make sure the streamers can see it
[2:58:05] now just stop it stop it just a minute
[2:58:08] it's no more spooky
[2:58:11] than what most of you have shown your
[2:58:13] children
[2:58:18] [Music]
[2:58:20] there's not a there's not a word or
[2:58:22] anything in that is there oh no it is
[2:58:24] rated pg

[2:59:59] day

[3:00:54] praying we need quickening power
[3:00:59] we need life-giving breath that comes
[3:01:03] from the nostrils of a living god
