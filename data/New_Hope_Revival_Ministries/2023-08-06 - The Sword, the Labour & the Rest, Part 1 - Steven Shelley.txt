Lord for our musicians tonight and God's good to us [Applause] isn't it isn't it wonderful to have sister West with us this weekend what a joy what a sweet joy to have her with us and all of you we're just so thankful I was feeling a little bit down because there weren't too many planning to be here although I know that God look you don't have to preach to me I know that God knows before the foundation of the world I know all that but I'm a human being and I thought oh I don't want it to lose momentum coming up toward camp meeting and sister Rebecca met me there at the at the going out of my office on Tuesday night to tell me the family was coming and my steps got lighter and I went home and posted so welcome to all of them can we give God another hand type of bread you think he'll be tired of us I don't think so Praise Him [Applause] Hallelujah I woke up this morning with a particularly unusual anointing and I could it's not always tangible we don't always feel it but I did this morning and I felt it moving all over my body I I so appreciated I sat on the bed I told my wife I said there's an anointing on me and I don't know I don't understand it I don't even know what to do about it but I I said I I'm I'm thinking I I might ought to just stay home and not go over to the campground because if I go over there something will agitate me and I don't want to get out from under this anointing and uh she said well you do whatever you feel to do but I didn't want anybody to feel forsaken either but I was right so I had to go home and do some praying and uh as I was sitting in the chair uh this is not what what particularly got me but someone was sharing with me it it hurts my feelings I'm not an easily wounded person I've proven that to you in these 30 years but it hurts my feelings when someone chooses an absolute other than the word of God you know I I I'm worried about that I'm concerned about that it's dangerous talk it's not Bible talk it worries me and I just went home kind of in that mood how can people get so blind by the by the preaching all these years what has been said and the people buy into that and they just repeated and repeated and repeated and and sometimes you'll say well where is that in the message and they'll say oh it's got to be in there somewhere because so-and-so said it so we don't even treat things like we ought to we we ought to check each other come on we've got to take it back to the Bible your pastor can't be your absolute you know Moses was not my absolute it's my absolute so I was feeling a little just oh you know and and it sometimes frustration can lead to desperation but it's not the same the Lord spoke to me this week those words clearly frustration is not the same as desperation we're not asking to be frustrated we're asking God to make us desperate and anyway that was in my heart uh that because he had he had just really I was at my desk and he just spoke that to me in in prayer and I appreciated it but I was needing a little something and I I don't ever usually even check email on Saturday but I went to my email and a pastor that I've never heard from ever ever ever before don't really even know who he is we have mutual friends and his email was I just want to introduce myself to you we've been watching the services and we are so blessed and the thing we appreciate the most is that you're not making a profit an absolute but the word of God is the absolute I needed to hear that so we are not alone we are not alone in this there are others who have isolated themselves because of the blasphemy that comes out of Jeffersonville they have isolated themselves and God is stirring those people in this last day and I'm thankful for that Hebrews chapter 4 I meant when I said blasphemy coming out of Jeffersonville I certainly didn't mean prior to 65. I mean in modern times in uh so I want to speak a little bit tonight as the Lord will let me and I want to ask you parents I almost did this Tuesday night and I I want to ask you parents to you know I don't know what the age limit should be but I think by the time someone is you know 13 or I think we could go way down more like seven or eight nine ten I'm not going to put an age limit on it I think they ought to be taught to stay awake I think you ought to teach them to stay awake and be alert in church you know when you're when you're if you're in the Jewish faith 13 years old you become a man and if you're a man you're old enough to learn to sit up and hear the word of God and show respect to the word if you don't respect your pastor that's between you and God but you don't have a choice about whether or not to respect the word it has preeminence above us all so I'm going to ask you parents to to just not nudge your children pinch them in love if they need it but maybe a nudge will get the job done and don't be a pillow for them because if you become a pillow they'll you I'll use it you know if I if you were to let me lean on your shoulder it wouldn't take me long to be asleep but I because of how I woke up this morning I have a feeling and it's just a it's just a just an inspiration that the Lord wants to talk to somebody I feel like I'm gonna need your help we've been a little sleepy the last few services and I feel like I can't do it without you I don't feel 100 physically and so I I really believe I'm going to have to depend on you all as well as the Lord I don't just mean loud I thank you for I need it but I mean in the faith pool you can silently pull in your faith God sees your Hungry Heart and he knows if you want to be spoken to is that right Hebrew I think I said four but I'm going to Hebrews chapter 3 don't get turned off when you hear what I'm reading and I'm going to read beginning in verse 8. Harden not your hearts you know you you got to actively work on keeping your heart soft because it gets wounded it gets hurt there's always misunderstandings in among people and you've got to keep you know there's only one way I know of to keep it from getting hard and that is keep pouring oil on it there's oil it out let the Holy Spirit the oil of God just keep pouring that on there so that it will not be hard Harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my Works how long 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do alway err in their heart air it's a short way of saying error they do always err in their heart and they have not known my ways with 40 years under a Vindicated Prophet that God spoke to lip to ear they saw the supernatural every day of their lives I had you to read those scriptures a few weeks ago when they got hungry God fed them when they got thirsty he gave them water when they wanted the menu to change he changed them in you and yet the word of the Lord is they have not known my ways we're not going to be that kind of a people so I swear in my wrath this is God they shall not enter into my ring they shall not enter into my rest they may have sat in every service that Moses was preaching but because there was something going on in their heart and they wouldn't allow the word of God to reveal what was going on in their heart they shut it out they didn't allow that word of God to get in and start searching and sifting through them they shut it out and so God says because because of this he said they shall not enter into my rest and why because they have not known my ways my ways are you here so he goes on to say take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief departing from the Living God remember how he started out don't Harden your heart keep your heart soft come on now you know I once had a man I know I'm reading I once had a man say to me in in our church he said now I don't want you giving my family a word from the Lord without my permission I said God bless you brother you won't have to worry about it I will not go against that Authority I said does that include your wife too now there was a problem there wasn't there he didn't have Pro he didn't have confidence in me call me as pastor but he didn't have any confidence in me he said if you've got a word for my family you come and tell me and then if I feel too I'll go with you and you can say it to them and I said well you won't have to worry about that brother I won't speak into their lives the responsibility is now yours I wash my hands of that responsibility your heart is hard you've hardened your heart how many of you have ever felt your heart getting hard it feels like numbness it starts off numbness and then you feel things bouncing off of you that ought to be penetrating you so don't let anybody say to your neighbor there I I don't know what that feels I don't know if my heart has ever been hard you know you know deny you're sitting in this room tonight and you know right now if you've hardened your heart nobody has to tell you if your heart's hard Hello I'm am I can I smile I uh I was a pain I was in pain God when I got here and uh I I come out of there and I was walking on the sore foot and I said I feel kind of like a grouchy old man but I put on the best smile I had for for Solomon and Zion they were sitting there I put on the best smile and waved and went back and hugged them and I said I feel like a grumpy old man did I fool you with my smile sometimes we just have to smile I'm calling on you to smile even if you feel a little under the microscope why not I've been under it with him this week shouldn't we all really want that place we should we should I'll let you sit down just a moment take heed Brethren lest there be an any of you an evil heart of unbelief something as simple as unbelief can cause the heart to to be not only hardened faithful oh that that really Grieves me somehow I don't want that I don't want that and and listen he said uh let me start said take heed Brethren unless there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in the party from the Living God you start pulling away from him and you don't even realize you're trying to show somebody else you're mad at them or you're trying to show somebody else they've hurt your feelings and by letting that get in your heart you're really pulling away from the Lord how can you say that because we're not doing what he told us to do but but exhort one another daily don't you think you can live this two nights a week two days a week and not get no more daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin lest you be caught up in sin and unbelief and not even know it because that stuff is deceitful it never announces itself when it comes in it just slips in and it starts taking a hold and it spreads through a family through a community through through through a a region even look at our mess look at our Mass right now in our country but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceivleness of sin for we are this is so powerful for we are made par takers of Christ co-participants with him that doesn't just mean we're taking from him it means we are partnering with him because there is a union that is found in a relationship with him if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast until the end has he ever failed you has God ever failed anybody in here I didn't ask you if you ever failed him I said has he ever failed you no there's no way to believe no reason to believe no no excuse to believe that he'd ever fail us now can you stand for two more verses Hebrews 4 11 and 12. now that was Hebrews 3 and you know when I get in Hebrews I want to read the whole chapter but I didn't let us labor therefore again this is the most paradoxical sentence in the Bible probably one of the most let us labor therefore to enter into that rest even rest doesn't come automatic there's a requirement to find rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief now remember what example he's talking about the children of Israel do you hear every little prophetic utterance every spiritual exhortation that was given tonight all referred us back to the children of Israel every one of them afford to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief for the word of God is quick and Powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword commentator say a two-edged sword is so designed that it on the draw it can cut coming out just like it cuts going in how many of you know the word it does that to us sometimes it cuts going in and it cuts going out but you know what he does he takes that same cutting word lays that blade right in the fire has he ever done it for you and then lays it on the wound he cauterizes the wounds heals you up and makes you stronger than you ever were before for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing this is so important here piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul mind will and emotions and spirit and whether we realize it or not this is the greatest question that all of us have in our life is that me or is that him am I the only one ever asked that Lord is that you or is that me is that you is that me I know what I'm feeling but is that you or is that me I know what I'm hearing but is that you or is that me there's only one answer there's only one answer there's only one thing to answer that it's the word of God because that word of God the edge of that two-edged sword is so fine and so sharp that you will cut yourself before you see the edge that's that's sharpened it it's like those cactus needle you they're the jumping cactus that Cactus don't jump you know why they call it the jumping cactus because the end of the knee the the uh what I call them needles is that what they say say it's so sharp and so fine that you don't see it and so you think you're gonna just test the end and you've already got on it it's already stuck in you before you ever thought you were getting to that that thing it's that fi the word of God can so be so fine and so sharp that it can get down in there and it can divide from the regenerated Spirit and the and the mind the will and the emotion and it can separate that for us so that we can say I am truly following the spirit of the Lord instead of my mind my will and my emotions how many of you just say word of God come on come on word of God come on word of God and do that for us and of the joints and Marrow get down into the marrow of the bone and is a discerner I don't know why people in the prophetic Church the first thing they think is somebody's been talking to somebody I know they talk but why would people in a church that had an edge of the prophetic why would that be your first thought don't you believe that God can speak to you in and don't you know he knew your conversations on the way over here tonight don't he don't you know he sat for you this week and has heard what you've said and he knows exactly how to speak to your need because he loves you and you are his and he doesn't want your heart to be hard and he doesn't want you following in falling falling in to any form of unbelief Lord we ask you right now to come and help us in your word bless your people strengthen your people anoint your people to receive the word come by the Holy Ghost and say Amen Lord perform your word in US anoint the people even the children to be alert to hear and to be Discerning so that you might take us we have come around the mountain again I I woke up this morning realizing we are right back to where we started before and we cannot afford not to get it now we've got to get it we've got to embrace this truth in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ anoint us all because your word is already anointed and the Saints said you may be seated let me see y'all David come if you would brother and get a microphone there and read for me you can stand down here you could even sit on the front row for a minute or two if you wanted to I want you to read a little bit for me I want you to read Hebrews chapter 4 that I just read you want to sit okay I don't care which one where you can stand whatever you feel comfortable doing do it uh I want you to read Hebrews 4 11 and 12 in the Amplified well they're going to put the Amplified up so you can read it right off the screen I just want to save my energy if you you'll do it for me I know you'll do a good job let us therefore be zealous and exert ourselves and strive diligently to enter that rest all right you've got a slow day on you're doing a fine job but this is the way that works I get to interrupt you multiple times see that's how they do it at the African-American church and tonight we're going to be African-American and we're we're going to let us let us therefore Zella oh somebody help me you want me to sing it to you no no I'm not gonna do that I'm just going to interrupt you and I want you to read it you know you can't read it like that David you can't say let us therefore be zealous four four now go ahead start over let us therefore be zealous and exert ourselves and strive diligently to enter that rest of God to know and experience it for ourselves look at that does that make any sense to anybody does that help anybody it amplifies it doesn't it King James said let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of me but look how the Amplified let us therefore be zealous desert ourselves strive how diligently to enter that rest what rest the rest of God to know and experience it for ourselves read on that no one may fall or perish by the same kind of unbelief and disobedience into which those in the wilderness fail do you understand why the warning or the admonition is coming to prevent any any of us from falling or even perishing under the same kind of unbelief and Disobedience into those switches so this is really they are an example to us as Paul said in in another place go on for the word of that God speaks start over for the word that God's word for the word that God speaks is alive and full of power making it active wait a minute it's alive for the word of God is alive for the word that's that God speaks is alive and full of power now David is going to tell you what that full of power means making it active active say it with us active operative operative energizing energizing and effective I love this word who could not love this word it is active it is energizing it is effective tell us more it is sharper than any two-edged sword penetrating to the dividing line of the Breath of Life Soul and the immortal spirit and of the joints and Marrow of the deepest parts of our nature let's go back we've got to see if we can understand that that word of God Is So active so operative so energizing and so effective it is so sharp that it can penetrate to the very dividing line of the Soul which is the breath of life that God you know God breathed breath into man and he became a living soul and the immortal Spirit which is your human spirit that has been regenerated by his eternal spirit so really that is that is as much as saying that word can divide between you and God so that you are able to always know by the word by the absolute [Applause] if this is you or if this is God now I'm a person who believes that God is capable of doing things that are not written in this word but I will tell you this he will never do anything that is contrary to this word never ever ever ever all right so it gets down in there between the Breath of Life Soul and the immortal Spirit go go on for us would you and of and of the joints and Marrow of the deepest parts of our nature [Music] now remember in Matthew Chapter 7 when the Bible says judge not that you be not judged for with what measure you meet it shall be meant to you in other words if you're if you judge you're going to be judged well what about the scriptures who say a righteous man or spiritual man judgeth all things what about scriptures that tell us there are times that we are to judge well the only thing that we can judge is whether or not something is bringing forth the fruit of the word if it is we say check mark if it's not bringing forth the fruit that the word produces we say that's the word is the absolute right gotta lay there so if if you say if you come to me like some half already married and say uh I believe the Lord's telling me to to get married again and and you say the Lord told me well then you put me in a bad place and I have to tell you well I don't know if it's the Lord or not I just know what his word said you may have to do like you do I can't stop you from that but you know what I can't have full confidence in somebody telling me something that's against God's word I have to watch that I have to watch that I've had that happen multiple times through the years so I have to look to the word does the word say thumbs up no the word says so I have to take the word so make it personal in your life maybe something a dream you have a goal you have something you'd like to do something you'd like to accomplish where you take that back to the word sometimes that's not always the easiest thing to do that's why we're so glad to have the Holy Ghost oh because he will help us to find the answers that we need in that Living Word he'll get right down into the deepest parts of our nature because sometimes we've got some nature left we've got some human nature left in US hello and we need something to get right down in there and do some dividing Now read on David I'm not trying to chop you up I'm really not I just want to make sure we get this exposing and shifting and analyzing 15. careful read again exposing and sifting and analyzing and judging now that's a lot that amplifies it pretty good for me that word gets down in there and it exposes and it sifts you see when we read that verse it says judge not that you be not judged if you look at the original Greek you'll find out that it's talking about judging another person's motives we have the right to judge fruit if it's according to the work that's judging if it's not according to the work anybody with me tonight I think you are so whatever the word says but the Bible tells us what we can't judge is somebody's motive now how many times this week have you said well I know why I know why he did that [Music] well I know why she said that I know why they handled it that way now when you do that you're doing the very thing that Jesus told us not to do when he said judge not that you be not judged he's speaking about judging another man's motives and you know you may be right you may be right that may be exactly why she said it but here is what Jesus would say from his word that is none of your business somebody said I didn't read that in the word I did he said what is that to you remember if I would that he tarry till I come remember the other Apostle what about John Lord what about John what about John Lord who's done that this week don't raise your hand what about him what about her I want to tell you something some of you ought to have no time at all to be examining somebody else's stuff cause yours is stinking everywhere [Music] it gets that way sometime and when our own life is the stinkiest is sometimes when we feel like we've got to start examining somebody else's motive every time you hear that scripture judge not that you be not judged remember it's judging another man or another woman's motive you might be exactly right but the question is what is that to you you might be absolutely wrong my favorite example was my good friend Paul Kane who was with us this week however many years ago this is the anniversary week of him being here the last time of the of the two times he was here I can hear him saying right now I like this Pulpit there's room to walk around up here I like this I can see him doing that but he would always say and it is the truth that he said I had such a complex because I had been talked about so much and he said I had such a complex that if if I saw people talking I I just knew they were talking about me and if I walked in and they all got quiet now listen you know just because somebody's quiet when you come in don't mean it's about you it may mean they don't want you to hear it because it's none of your business that's not personal that may not be against you it might be to protect you it might be for your good that somebody doesn't want you to know might not be there are people who love secrets I don't trust those people I don't trust them I'd rather be transparent I would rather you know something bad about me I would I figure we can deal with that I can repent you can forgive me if you want to don't if you don't want to and we'll go on but I don't want to hide I don't want to hide I don't want to live my life incognito I don't want you to live your life that way don't you let the devil torment you but I know that I've heard what they said and I know they talk about they may have but don't assume that because you walk into a room and people look at you and they Huss that they were talking about you in that moment and papa Paul said to me I I'm the worst and then he made the joke that you've heard me make so many times he said I had to quit going to the football game because he said when I got the football game and saw the teams down there in a huddle he said I just knew they were talking about me now he made that a joke but I was around him enough and got emails from him enough in 52 Point font this is how we emailed each other for the last years of his life in letters that big he said I always like your emails because they always come big enough for me to read I don't ever have to string to read them and in every one of those I would hear the paranoia in his voice reading his text I could hear him panicked paranoid he was absolutely right he had been maligned he had been lied about some of you know that that that we paid a ticket and brought someone here one time who had lied against him and sat back there in the office and let this young man face him and he wilted like a little flower and said I lied we said you didn't just lie you lied to leaders maybe you've heard the name Mike Bickel you've lied to leaders you've lied to people of influence and now you the damage is done and all we can do is clean it up in this room but we can we can we can only pray that the effects of that will be mitigated but that stuff went around until even after his death uh there were just hideous things he was paranoid there's no room for you and I to move in paranoia we can't judge one another's motives you may think you know why somebody does what they do but there's only one thing that can get down into the base nature of a man come on thank God for this word thank God for this word because it searches us it searches us you know my encounter you know the White Eagle that came into my room some years ago I was sleeping there with a with a bare chest in my bed next to my wife I wake up on my back which I rarely in those days slept on my back I have to now that must be noisy but I have to now but in those days I always slept on my side uh and sometimes on my stomach like that this night I was so tired I fell asleep before I could get positioned I wake up and I see two red lights on my bare chest two red laser lights and a fear struck me because I had seen enough movies in the past to know that ain't a good thing that means you are in somebody's sights and the next the next thing that happened ain't good that means a bullet comes next but there was such a presence that I looked up and over my bed was a was a huge king-size bed stretched the edges of the of the bed just filled up the up above the bed a white eagle and he was looking down on my chest with those penetrating red laser light eyes and I knew that whatever that represented in that moment I there was no secret from him whatever that was there was no hiding you know my testimony being in Arizona at a conference that I was invited as a guest where they were going to repent charismatic movement was going to repent for how they had maligned brother Branham and and A.A Allen and they invited me to come as a guest and I'm sitting there on a chair and a lightning bolt I'm telling you it was a lightning bolt from eternity struck my chair right between my legs my legs were spread like that as you would sit on a folding chair and and there was just enough of that folding chair exposed that that lightning of God came and struck that and later a friend that I had confidence in he said that was God observing your base nature there is nothing about you that God hasn't discerned it's a good thing don't take it as a negative thing take it as a positive thing because this is the only thing that can judge your motive and it's also the only tool that can cut you up and get every root out of you that doesn't need to be there and heal you too same sword same sword that performs the surgery laid against us in the spirit and seals up the wound cauterizes the wound so that we can heal Church we're blessed to have this Living Word it's active operative energizing and effective come on and it exposes and sifts and analyzes and judges the very thoughts and read on David and and purposes of the heart see you and I have no right to analyze the purposes of someone's heart or to judge what makes someone tick or to analyze why someone did listen this is such good advice did you know this could heal your marriage did you know this doesn't only work for church business this is this is healing for a marriage I've lived with him long enough tonight there ain't nothing about her that I don't know her up one on the next but I know what she really means how many times this week as a husband said to a wife I know what you mean how many times this week has a wife said to her husband I heard what you said but I know what you meant I don't have no hands up but I see red cheeks glory be to God the Holy Ghost is on the case cause I see blushing going on somebody knows what I'm saying is right we can't even do that with our own companion you may be right you may know her better than anybody on this planet knows her but God did not give you the grace to be able to see the intents of her heart God did not give you the gift to be able to discern between Soul and Spirit there's only one force and that's not 40 Years of Living With Somebody there's only one force that can get down to the nitty-gritty and that's the word I read we're an African brother this week uh was talking and he said he said uh we were my family was sitting down reading the Bible and he said my son was using the same hand to turn the pages of the Bible that he was using to pick his fingers and his toes this is how How African people look at things and he said I corrected him and I said go wash your hands I don't know if that's necessary remember I told you that I had to redo my whole program in India because I was preaching on the television in India and I'm PR for a fat man I'm pretty flexible not everybody can lay that leg flat like that sums up like that you know me I don't know why I was built that way but I was using my leg as my Bible prop and the Indian Church felt like that the Bible was getting too close to my foot my shoe and they were offended by it so I had to change my posture I grew up with a family who didn't believe in laying their Bible on the ground and to this day I catch myself laying something on top of my Bible and and not religiously I don't repent and go through a whole process of forgiveness I just did it you know not conscious conscious of it but when I see it I to this day will pick something up and take it off my Bible so they can sit there we if and and I'm not I'm not making a Doctrine on that because that's only the written record of the word there's something more precious on the inside of you you who have received the word hello and if we should be so so obliged to to honor a book how much more how much more should we respect the Living Word of God when it's in our midst and not only the Living Word of God that comes through the preaching because you start preaching the revealed word and the Living Word comes he comes he's in the building now how do you know that because you feel it no because he promised it and I have no reason to believe that he would keep not keep his word to us but that and how much more should we give honor and respect to the Living Word that's planted in somebody else's life so even treating one another with respect and honor and creating such a culture is a is a benefit in the body of Christ I don't know if that little boy but but that Dad felt like that little boy was going to learn something from that experience and uh and maybe maybe he's absolutely right maybe all of us can you just sit tight there David for a little while or do you does your wife need your help if she doesn't need your help just sit tight there for for just a few minutes uh you can do some more reading for me now now this is uh that Hebrews was just a foundation for where where we're going tonight let me see how much time I have okay just a little while I want you to read Genesis 1 27. back to the beginning of the notes I jumped ahead to give you a little foundation for where we're going but I wouldn't take any of that back I believe every bit of it was ordered of the Lord Genesis 1 27. pray is his name you okay Hallelujah okay David you're on so God created man in his own image don't go back to I mean get in there now and read that good don't go back to that don't you hate to be listening to somebody preach you'll never accuse me of being monotone you'll accuse me of screaming but you'll never accuse me of being monotone I cannot take monotone talkers that it's all like this they never go up they never go down they just leave the voices like this it's like listen to a robot I don't even know if God can anoint that when it's just like this it really gets on my nerves so you weren't doing that David but I want you to get in there and read this like it is written so God so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him him male and female created he them them very good now go to Genesis 2 7 would you and the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul that's powerful I love that verse read it again one more time and the Lord and the Lord God formed man out of it Formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground and and breathes into his nostrils the Breath of Life and Man became a living Soul he's just a body there created from the Dust came from the dust the body goes back to the dust he would lay there a Dusty body forever and ever but almighty God Elohim came and breathed the breath of life into the nostrils of Adam Adam and the the name Adam means red Earth meaning that he was created from the Red Dirt from the red Earth so the dirt in Eden must have been similar to the dirt in Alabama because I didn't I've never seen too much red dirt in Israel it's changed now because I never saw but I know where there's a lot of Red Dirt God made Adam from the Dust from the dirt breathe breath go ahead finish and breathed and breathed the breath into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul and Man became a living Soul now the dust of the ground Earth the breath of life was what came from eternity I want to remind you this evening The church here has been taught this but I want to remind you this evening that we are made of two Source realms we are all made from the spiritual and from the physical one part from God which is Spirit and the other part from the earth which is physical which is natural I want you to put up the paragraph from Gene Edwards would you do that I've mentioned the name of Gene Edwards before and this is this is the paragraph that he wrote I love this concerning uh the creation of man in in in in one of his books I don't remember if this came out of Divine Romance or if it came out of the book he wrote on creation but I want to quote Gene Edwards to you this evening he said God came to man in the lowlands of the earth realm he breathed man so magnificently formed of the Earth breathed into him spiritual Realm oh does that resonate with anybody that was God adding added he had just created he breathed into him the spiritual realm The life-giving Winds of Heaven the breath of divinity oh that's great from the mouth of the almighty Creator came a ours that surged with divine power into the nostrils of Adam and flowed through his body and soul permeating every cell that's a writer permeate oh read it again brother okay I will out from the mouth of the almighty Creator came a brilliant dazzling see how I'm reading David sparkling effervescence like living stars that surge with divine power into the nostrils of Adam flowed through his body and soul permeating every cell of his being sounds like me the night I got the Holy Ghost though that wind this that spirit that breath that Celestial air that Divine and Heavenly life animated the clay model creating within a dimensionless quality condition and state of being does anybody find that beautiful and then read for me David Genesis 2 8 we're going somewhere we're going to do something now Genesis 2 8. and the Lord God come on planted a garden Eastward in Eden now notice again he planted a garden where Eastward in Eden so Eden was more than a garden say that with me Eden was more than a gardener there was an Eden and in that Eden on the east side of the land of Eden which is Delight the word Eden means Delight when we say uh again Eden we are saying the garden of delight oh to think that God delighted to make such a place he planted a garden Eastward in Eden read the rest of that for me and and there he put the man whom he had formed okay so see this with me for a few minutes tonight Eden is a big place we don't know exactly how big but the Bible does give us some dimensions and tells us there are four rivers that come together and eat which puts it uh across that huge land uh because the river Euphrates is is part of that that that concept so we don't know exactly how big Eden was as as a creation but God made a place called Eden delight and then in the Easter Eastward part of that land that he created he made a garden we call that the Garden of Eden because it was a garden in the land of Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed now there's something you can get out of this you can get from this that God did not make Adam in the Garden of Eden we've always sought and we've always read picture book and we see that God created Adam in the Garden of Eden he didn't he created Adam in Eden and then he created a garden and what did he do he put the man whom he had created who he had formed he placed him ever so purposefully he placed him in the garden of delight isn't that good oh I like that I've got one more quote from Gene Edwards it's a good one in that wonderful day when the Lord God planted a garden in Eden for the man in His image God stood in the boundary between Heaven and Earth and did a most incredible thing stretch forth his hands of omnipotence and took this terrestrial ball in one hand as with the other he grasped the Heavenly Realm I want you to see that Earth and Heaven how is man made part Earth part Heaven part physical part spiritual this is what God was doing that day he was reaching into the heavenlies and bringing it down he was reaching into the Earth that he created and bringing it forward he was going to pull them together it's part of his Divine Purpose he held that terrestrial ball in one hand as with the other he grasped the Heavenly realm he moved the two toward one another that's good isn't it he brought the spiritual realm the Timeless realm the dimensionless realm toward planet Earth and moved Earth toward the Heavenly Realm the two moved closer and closer like brother Branham told us until they did what yeah Heaven and Earth kissed each other they came together in that moment of time the two Realms touched entering into Union with one another the area where Heaven and Earth met together and overlapped he called Eden that's what the Jewish people teach that's what they believe that when Heaven touched Earth the place of the smack was Eden and in Eden he created a garden the the place where these two Realms met overlapped and interfaced became unlike Earth and unlike heaven that which had never existed before not heavenly and not Earthly something entirely different can you follow that line of thought you you can discern whether you think that's right or not I I I'm one thousand percent convinced that that's what he did because that's what God's doing in this hour so I find that very easy to believe God is bringing Heaven and Earth back together he's absolutely bringing that realm closer to this realm and the bride is the ones caught in the middle of the smack what he's doing now by his word and by his spirit is bringing those around close because unbelief and and all that has happened in the Earth has pushed Heaven back and caused the Earth to fall into its Fallen State and now God is reaching out into this Earth finding those that were his before the foundation of the world building his sanctuary in them allowing the word of God to live in them come on changing them from glory to glory from strength to strength from Faith to Faith so that what we will eventually have again is Kingdom which is bigger than Church in that day it was the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth that's exactly what Jesus was establishing in his Earthly Ministry if you can see that or if it in any way resonates with you can you say Amen all right now Eden means Delight speaks to us of a state of being even more than a location man in the image of God and in communion with God and in Union with him have you ever said the word communion and did you know that the word Union shows up in the word communion so when we take the Lord's supper and we call it communion we're celebrating something more than just a Passover seder we're celebrating more than just a meal that the Messiah shared with his disciples when the bride takes that bread and the bride brings that cup of wine representing the blood of Jesus we're celebrating the union not the union that shall be but the union that is the union that God is forming now as he takes the veil off of his word is anybody here he unveils he continuously consistently unveils his word to us and so Adam was placed in the garden and the garden was also placed in Adam because the Bible talks about man's heart being like a garden so God put Adam in a garden and God put a garden in Adam and God told Adam you better tend to that garden and God told you you better tend to yours anybody with me that's where we started preaching tonight is everybody getting busy about tending their own garden if I would that he tarry till I come what business is out of yours you tend your garden I don't know about you but I find that it increasingly takes a lot of my time tending my garden because overnight you'd be surprised overnight something will find its way into the garden of my heart overnight I can find something growing that just the day before I thought I had cleared it all out but what I have taught you and you some of you gardeners already knew what I have taught you is the worst thing you can do is pull a weed out of your garden and shake the dirt off and we do it because we you know if you're if you're serious about it you're thankful for the dirt it's good dirt you put it there you've you've cultivated that dirt you worked on that dirt to get it to where it is and you don't want it going in a trash bag so what you do is you pull the weed and you shake it and you shake the dirt back but guess what else you do you shake the seed if you've got them old crazy little weeds that look like a a mimosa tree everywhere oh my there's so many of them so me they have little spores you turn the leaves over they've got little spores underneath you go to shaking like that you're just giving birth you can't do it you you get in there one day and you start taking them out and overnight you go back and it looks like you've never never even visited yourself have you found that out about your own spiritual life you come to the altar you get in the presence of God you feel the word digging around on some of your stuff you leave the church you go back home to your family you go through all those things you have all those things built up resentments come and jealousies come and Stripes come come on and judging everybody's motive it starts creeping up I know why she did and I know what she meant and I know what he was why he was doing that I know what they were getting to hello and you got to dig again because God put Adam in the garden and God put the Garden in Adam and you and I are charged with the responsibility to tend God's Garden in US come on now somebody said can you relate that to something else so that I can get a hold of it I will it's the greatest battle ever fought it's the same thing it's tending your own thoughts it's it's catching your own thoughts is pulling down your own thoughts it's submitting everything and anything every emotion every feeling every thought subjecting it to the truth hello I need a little help don't Wilt just yet we're going to give you breakfast now I've got to move on David would you read Genesis 2 16-17 whatever offering they give me tonight I'll split it with you that won't be hard to do read on and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat every tree You Can Eat You Can Eat You Can Eat you can eat that's all some people hear they got so excited you get so excited over the buffet that you don't hear please take a Clean Plate you forget to listen for all the instructions and rules read the next one for us would you but but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil let's break that word down just a moment the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil did you know that had that tree never been planted Adam would have never known evil now now remember what what evil is it's raw when the Bible said and it was very good the word good is what tovan what does Tove really mean it means when a seed that God has planted begins to bring forth the original intent and purpose for which it was planted God looks at that and says that is good if God should plant a seed in your life and and you not cultivate that seed and water that seed and guard that seed and fertilize that seed so that that seed does not bring forth its potential God put it there for a reason how many of you know God put some things in us for a reason anybody awake he put some things in us for a reason and some we cultivate and some we leave look if God's give you a gift to sing sing and you don't have to wait till you have a microphone in your hands sing [Music] car crying out loud singing Walmart [Applause] seed that God planted in you to reach its fullest potential because if it does not reach its potential do you know what God calls it evil evil evil evil now if I were in this and I was doing all the doing I would call it disappointing because I've been as a gardener I've planted things that didn't come that didn't survive it's disappointing you feel so disappointed but what do you do you snatch it out and buy another one [Music] you don't give up you try again come on maybe you've never farmed outside you girls but you a lot of you have green plants and some of them aren't fake in your house some of you live in a jungle I told him the other day at my house that we have a bird of paradise that sits in the living room and it is growing so big I have to push it out of the way to look across the living room there's one leaf on it Chad saw it the other day there's one leaf on it about that big it's one of the biggest leaves I've ever seen what happens if you fail ask Mariah because she has failed several times along the way in her in her houseplant studies if you like you like want to have it you get you another one and you start again so if I were writing this script I would say that if God gives you a seed and it doesn't bring forth this full potential I would say that's disappointing and God's got a lot of seed so I would just say Lord give them another seed they went on vacation the plant died they got caught up in the swirl of somebody's gossip I'm going to say this I hope you'll be okay they took on somebody else's offense that's illegal that's illegal that's illegal you can't be offended because I am that's mine I've got to deal with that I got to deal with that and that's why it's better not to tell people what you're offended by oh pastor's preaching tonight you'll be you'll be I tell you what you'll be doing you'll be circulating a uh petition to bring in a special speaker the next time we have a a buy-in bi-monthly meeting you'll say now we've had enough of that we were ready for a special speaker I'm going to tell you like it is you you you don't want to don't want to take on somebody else's offense and I'll tell you how human beings are misery I'm really preaching now Ms I'm not even screaming but I'm preaching misery loves company if I can just get one person to be offended with me it reminds me of the little children when we all pull together when we all Pat together how miserable we'll be for your offenses my offense and my offenses your offense when we all talk together how miserable we'll be I just wrote that I hope they don't make me pay a royalty you can't carry somebody else's events it'll rot your seed but but you get caught in these swirls of things I I I I I I I'll get i'll get started in a minute I learned to watch for it when this uh reel started you know getting out there on Facebook it's first one we've ever had on Facebook to have that many views it's got over forty thousand views now it's been shared how many times 600 something times have over 600 comments or something like that or locks locks locks and uh I know some of you don't care I don't I mean you know I can't say I don't care because I do but but it has both good and bad it has positive and negative you know one person will say finally somebody tells the truth and the next person will say that preacher needs to let somebody else eat some of the pizza foreign one comment says that's the truth I'm waiting on amen amen amen and somebody else says who made him the authority so when I know I've done this enough I've been in this thing long enough to know that when even something like that is out there in the Airways who who is it that is Lord over the airwaves [Applause] who is the prince of the power of the air Satan it's the prince of the power of the air if it gets up there in his domain he has the ability to twist put the Leviathan spin on it it starts drawing attention of the heavenly and it starts to bring it starts drawing attention of the second heaven so you start you start getting attention in third heaven and you start getting attention in second heaven you've got Angels moving around to help you and you've got demons plotting their next attack against you just for something as simple as a real a meme that's why we pray every day over one another I pray every day particularly for you sister Anna Christine every day for for a good amount of time because I realize that just by you picking these nuggets and presenting them out there pushing them out there you become vulnerable you draw the attention of the uh of that which is beyond the third heaven but you also draw the attention of that which is in second heaven where Satan has built his throne and strangers get stirred you think witches see that that you think the occult s you think if something goes out there forty thousand views you think there's somebody in there that would like to curse so if we're going to have a reach out that's a that's a reverse of Outreach if we're going to have a reach out we need to know that it's going to take prayer to keep every one of us where we need to be as some of you have realized that through the years we've had to deal with these spirits that have come to undermine what God had done and what he was doing and who he was trying to use we've had to deal with that you have to sometimes say God bless you au revoir go find your place get in it and do everything you can for God we've got to understand there comes a time that even Apostles of scripture can't work close together and there's times that they have to say go on but here's what I learned in my experience in in Frederick Maryland I was in a doing a convention a conference in Frederick Maryland when I was taken into that Realm where demons were competing they were struggling for the position to replace another principality that had been ripped off his throne by the authority of Jesus Christ I want to explain that just just a moment to someone who may never heard that again but I saw those Thrones were principalities and Powers were sitting and they were ruling over regions and areas and even families because sometimes Spirits can can predominantly show up in Family Lines in regions in certain areas there are regions of our country and and you think there's a homosexual Spirit on them because because there's a lot of homosexuals living in that region but what you don't understand is that thing drew them there it wasn't for for because they heard that there were a bunch a bunch of homosexuals living there it's because there's a spirit over certain areas that operates predominantly over an area and it draws people who are under the Same Spirit just like brother Branham would say in a service that spirit is rising up there and calling out to this other Spirit similar spirit for help [Applause] getting some help and some string now I tell you that's how it works and I saw that that what was being accomplished in some of those meetings is that principality spiritual wickedness in high places was being pulled down and I saw Spirits rolling off of Thrones losing their Authority being toppled but that was good and that made me Rejoice but what I saw next was like a strong man competition in the spirit if this is too much for you plug your ears if you wanted an ordinary church that's where you ought to be but they started competing like a strong man competition these demon spirits to see who would show and demonstrate the most power so they could crawl up and occupy that place that look Satan is never going to be satisfied with a throne sitting empty with a region not having a predominant spirit with a family not dealing with certain issues and so the enemy out there is just looking for something else somebody said I don't I don't even I can't even fathom that that's because you don't know how important you are you don't understand your value in the Kingdom all of Heaven wants to get a hold of you and all of hell wants to get a hold of you for the same reason because God has sown his seeds of potential in you you carry the seeds of Destiny so if I were setting this thing up and and God give a seed and this seed is flourishing I'd say yeah that's good that's told but if you happen to have a seed and it wasn't doing too good because you got caught up in something that was going on some strong man competition in the other realm you got caught up in someone's offense you got caught up in someone's jealousy you you got this social justice kind of thing getting on you or you always feel like you've got to take up for the underdog yeah and sometimes you don't understand what he said when he was telling us we don't want to be guilty of praying something off of somebody that he put on them because if God allowed that and he put that on him he did it to drive them into their full potential so you get up there trying to cast that off you're you're going against God's ordained plan for their life so just be careful I just say that's disappointing you've got one seed flourishing you've got one seed about to dry up and die but God's got a lot of seed but that's not what God says God's bigger than I am he's smarter than I am he has a different way of looking at things than I do I have to I have to work at thinking like him come on now I have to utilize the mind of Christ that's been given to me and when God sees something stay away just a moment when God sees in you one seed thriving he said that's Tove he might even say that's Tove mayode which is very good very good but if he sees one over here that's not doing anything accomplishing anything he doesn't say that's disappointing he doesn't even say that's non-tove not good he actually says it's raw in Hebrew and R A in Hebrew ra is evil God says God says that it's actually evil when you allow a seed hear me of Destiny and purpose that he has planted in your life for you to let that go untended ungarden uh unguarded undernourished for whatever reason for whatever else you got occupied in while this seed is drying up and Dying God doesn't say I'm disappointed he says that's evil he actually says in the New Testament that's unbelief because if you believed what I had placed in you you'd be doing something with it you know this principle is also taught in the garden in the in the parable of the talents you don't take what God's placed in your care and bury it in a hole and then go back and say well I got your dried up seed you left me you go back and take him a harvest and say look what I've done with what you gave me I've multiplied it I've utilized it I've taken that muscle and exercised it serious Adam would have never even known evil he would have never even known that's what knowledge means he would have never even known evil he was created to no good that's a god-consciousness that Adam was created with that he saw God in everything every time Adam moved he saw God it wasn't just in the cool of the day when God came down and met with him that he saw God he saw God in every blade of grass he saw God in every grain of sand ever a little toad frog every Cricket every grasshopper every everything that are you listening everything that he encountered he saw God in that I see God in that I see the thumbprint of the Creator until that day in Eve the same until that day because God was conditioning them to be able to eat from the Tree of Life but once they took of that tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Adam not only had a consciousness of God and the consciousness of good but he now knew that there was an opposite of good and that was bad that was evil that was rotten and all the trouble you've ever had in your life is because of the knowledge of evil had we not but remember God planned this whole thing because God didn't want robots that only knew how to do good and only knew what good was he actually wanted people who could see both sides of the coin good and evil and choose good all the power is in your choice I'm preaching again the power's in your choice whether you choose the good or will you choose the evil we all know there's evil we all know we all know when when it tries to operate in US we know when we try to sit down on a seed that God's placed in our life something he wants to do through us we all know when we're sitting down on that now I want you to read one more thing and I'm going to I haven't gotten anywhere I am on the middle of page two but I wanted to get a little further than this I want you to read Genesis 2 16 and 17 but these people have come a long way and I know I know as good as the biscuits and graveyard I know that's not why they've come I I think you all could have probably said amen you visitors there uh Austin Hannah come on sister that you missed a good place to shout I said I know they didn't come for the biscuit and graviness and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest eat freely but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it don't eat it don't eat it go ahead for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die somebody said but they didn't die but they did the innocence of only having a god Consciousness died that day oh I'm telling you something anybody that's ever chosen sin anybody that's ever chosen a filthy habit you know the sting of that that tree of of Eve knowledge of evil every time you've ever told yourself I'll never do it again you've known the taste of that fruit from the Tree of evil had it not been that way but remember again I want to make sure you understand God didn't want you to serve him as a robot he wanted to put two two tables out there for you and he wanted you to choose and at this point he knew the only way that you would ever choose to eat of the Tree of Life would be if you first ate bye of the tree of the knowledge of evil he knew the only way that you would ever understand the value of eating Jesus first you were going to have to take what the stupid devil was serving you either did it by adamic Nature finding the Lord as a child or you did it as an adult but every one of us have tasted that evil fruit we know and we know the guilt that comes with it and we know the condemnation that comes with it and and and that last way longer than the high preach brother wow longer that awful feeling lasts a lot longer than the moment of pleasure David one more uh Genesis 3 1-3 we agree with going somewhere we'd have to do it tomorrow I guess let's get these verses in these are so familiar Genesis 3 1-3 I guess it's 8 48 so that's almost now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made this this word subtle in Hebrew is not just conniving it's beguiling and beguiling means to appeal to the senses it actually speaks rather clearly of appealing to the sensual nature of a person that flesh pleasure you understand what I mean the sexuality of a man that's just the word that's used there is a great portion of Jewish people who believe original sin like you and I believe original sin it's not mainstream it's not the multitudes but there are there are major groups of Jewish people around the world who believe original sin like you do simply because of the Hebrew word that is chosen here it doesn't just mean he told a lie it means he used everything within his power to appeal to the lowest nature read on David I just keep doing it to you don't I and he said unto the woman yea hath God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die see there's a little twist read verse 4 and 5 for us and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die you shall not surely die I know that's what God Said but you're not really gonna die verse 5 for God does know that in the day ye eat thereof then then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil the very thing that was going to give her a wretched life the very thing that was going to change the history of humanity forever he sold it to her like a prize your eyes are going to be open and you're going to be as gods that old lion deceiving seducing devil that had hijacked that Serpent and crawled in his body possessing him and speaking through him knew what he was saying and he knew what he was doing he wasn't just selling her a lie he was telling her exactly what she needed to hear to appeal to that you see Adam would have never fallen for that lie the Bible tells us the New Testament Adam was not deceived but he was the one in deception Adam chose knowing full well eyes wide open he knew exactly what he was doing he was under no deception or seduction he was forerunning becoming Messiah he didn't do it stellarly he did blame her for a few things when God came down you know the story right it's not the tree of that knowledge of Good and Evil that was going to make him his gods weren't they already as gods didn't they already have full Authority didn't Adam already have dominion over everything that God had made hello so he was actually offered the offering them a repackaged reality you're already seeing more than than you can imagine you're already operating in more Authority than you than you fully understand and yet he said God knows that in that day that you take part of this your eyes are really going to be open and they were but it wasn't in that moment that they were going to no good they'd already known good but in addition to the good they had known they were now going to No Evil it was going to give them a consciousness of that which is wrong because before that moment all they knew was that which was right and it was as though nothing else existed the serpent sowed a seed of resentment into Eve make sure when you're quoting the prophet and you often use the seed of discrepancy please understand that for Eve the seed of discrepancy was resentment he knew resentment [Music] he knew that if he could get Eve to doubt the loving nature of her Abba her Creator and even grow to resent he is what what he was doing if I can get her to doubt that God is all together good and lovely and that somewhere he's running a scheme to keep me away from the better life that's what he was selling her he was telling her there's a better life and God knows that you're going to breach into that better life if you take her that he also knew that in the moment that she started along that that line of thinking that he could get her to do anything he wanted her to do listen listen to me because if the enemy can cause you I want you to hear this and close if the enemy can get you to doubt that your God is all together good and that he is all together lovely if if that enemy can cause you to doubt that he loves you ultimately ultimately above all if if that old enemy can get you to feel some moment of resentment toward God he let me lose my baby he let me lose my marriage hello he let me lose my family he was trying to keep me down it seems so and so drives a new car I can't afford to repair the old car I've got you see how that resentment starts working you see ultimately the only reason why the enemy wants us to resent one another is he's building a case so that we will one day resent God and we'll say you know we hear people saying all the time life isn't fair that's just that's just one swallow you've just swallowed one seed that's just a little bit of the discrepancy that life isn't fair but what the enemy really wants you to believe is that God isn't fair because if you begin to believe that God isn't fair then you pull yourself out of fellowship and relationship with him isn't that right so that word that Satan was giving through the serpent inside the emotions of Eve and by the way women are not the only emotional creatures in the house but the enemy knew how to speak right into her emotion causing her to feel that God was withholding something good from her everybody everybody but not you know God knows he don't want you to be like him well that's exactly what he wanted it was just going to take a Calvary to bring that to pass and Satan thought if I can pollute the seed now you know the whole the whole purpose of injecting a seed was to pollute the bloodline so that there would never be a possibility of Christ coming as a pure seed you follow that if the serpent you know used he was hijacked and used for a purpose and the enemy said if I can find a seat that would mingle with man come on then I can contaminate the bloodline and no one will ever know who comes from a Pure Line like the Pure Line of Sith are from the Fallen line of Cain it's all about it's all about the seed it always has been it all always will be so I mean Satan was doing more than just trying to get her to be mad at God he was trying to hijack the whole purpose of redemption let's stand but how do you end I need to bring that to a positive point and in order to do that would take more time musicians are coming I don't want to take more time to bring that back to the positive but if you come in the morning the Lord willing will try to do that because it's extremely positive what I'm really trying to get to and I will hopefully will land there tomorrow what I really want to get to is how how uh negative we see what happened when God said okay you can't stay here anymore you can't live here anymore you're going to have to go live somewhere else you know part of that was Adam was taken from ground outside of the garden and there's something you need to know there were no graves in the garden Adam was created to never die but because he had partaken of this sin he was going to die and there was to be no death no graves in that Garden because death and the Tree of Life cannot exist in the same Realm you get a taste of that tree you live forever come on now so God was going to have to take him out of that garden and he Adam and Eve and put them in Exile he was going to have to drive them out and we see that as such a negative thing did God really have to put a flaming sword and Cherry beams to guard the way he did but here's where the church has missed the teaching they teach that God put that flaming sword there and those cherubims there to keep people from getting to the Tree of Life and that is not what the scripture said the Bible said it was to guard the way to protect the way because the ultimate goal is that that every destination destinied get back to the garden because in the garden there is another tree and that's the Tree of Life and once you Feast on that thank you Lord thank you for the Living Word once you Feast on that your eyes are opened again and you realize that what the enemy sold you is a bill of goods you owned and possessed potentially all along you always were created to have that Dominion and Satan was promising you something that was already yours and so now you realize all I have to do is take all I have to do is get back so the purpose was not to keep people from the tree it was to protect the way because you're not going to walk in and take a bite of that tree of life like fools walking around with hobnail shoes there's a way there's a way it's called the way of holiness [Music] God shut up God has an order and he has a way the way shall be called the way of Holiness and and no fool shall stumble air therein if you get on that way that has been protected for you by a flaming sword that turns I'm gonna give all my punchlines away but it turned whichever direction you need God to talk to you in you have not walked down a road that that word can't help you get get get on the right path you've never fallen so far or stumbled so bad or straight shoot you've never strayed so far away Hallelujah I would have had more amens than that but what that word will go looking for you you see it's not there to keep you from it's there to protect the way to get to I'll show you I'll show you I've preached this for years I'll show you it's a gift and I'll also show you that that the same fire that that was on that sword it was guarding the way that fiery sword that's the same fire that fell on the day of Pentecost um so it looked like the fire was trying to keep you out but the fire was really trying to take you in Hallelujah and when you get some of that fire on you you'll be like Jeremiah it's like fire shut up on your bone in your bones Hallelujah anyway we gotta close let's just let's just worship him you got something to lead us in Chad I've rattled on longer than I expected to hallelujah it's nine o'clock that's not too too bad let me get all my Waters and good morning [Music] a light of creation fears [Music] perfect world and I'm Amazed at his talents I stand

don't even want to say this but I I have to because I want us to lay this before the Lord if you're here and you'd say Pastor I find myself at times feeling sorry for myself I just look around and I look Inward and I see all the hardship and my past and I just feel sorry for myself sometimes and and when I do I don't ever feel good you don't you don't ever leave that moment feeling good it it don't really make you feel better about life but I won't I believe the Lord wants to just deal with that in every one of us I don't know who could be that honest but I'm going to give you an opportunity just to be that honest right now and just say uh sometimes I just find myself feeling real sorry for myself and and what I have to deal with and what I Lord you see these Honest Hearts we're honest before you and and there are times that we feel that way we we look at other people's lives and sometimes look at ours and we think they've got it better than we do and easier than we do it and they complain more sometimes caught up in that gerbil wheel of sorry for herself and when we do Lord we're not confessing your word we're just talking out of our emotions I ask you tonight to create a clean heart in US would you pray with me right now if you feel it Lord would you create in me a clean art I want that out I want to know Lord that with your help and with you in in my life I can make it I can I can overcome I don't have to be a victim I don't have to live with a victim mentality caught up in that vicious cycle of comparison because you are so good to me Lord would you just take that route out would you rip that right out that that self-preserving sympathy that we carry for our own situation would you just rip that out and fill us with such gratitude and Thanksgiving of your faithfulness and your goodness in our lives sometimes we say well what if I'd have had a daddy or what if I'd have had a mother or what if I'd had a better daddy or better mother what if I'd have lived in another place but Lord tonight I just want to thank you for for my life and I want to give you thanks for every time you have seen me through Lord would you just feel your children right now with a spirit and with an attitude of of gratitude and Thanksgiving and Deliver Us somebody ain't praying that ought to be praying Deliver Us from that feeling sorry for ourselves and then getting mad with others because they don't seem to feel sorry enough for us but maybe they don't because we seem to have it covered forgive us Lord rip that out I want to thank you for my family I want to thank you for my life I want to thank you for this church I want to thank you for your goodness and your faithfulness and I don't want to carry that brother Austin do you still need prayer Joshua bring the oil to me would you create in me [Music] still struggling tonight [Music] if you go to the doctor if you don't feel any different next few days yeah I'm going to pray I'm going to believe God but I also know that prednisone at an early stage when you first start showing symptoms like that can make a world of difference would you ask the Lord whatever is going on it seems to be we don't like to put names on anything but it seems to be something operating on brother Austin like Bell's palsy and we don't want that we want that gone and uh it's a neurological condition caused by infection in the nerve and uh I know that God can drive inflammation and infection out of his body restore uh everything the eye a little bit droopy what else your mouth drawn a little bit too and we know that the Lord can do it and we want to believe God for a miracle so that he wouldn't even have to go beyond that I don't mean to be you know I I wouldn't dare trying to put doubt in I'm just saying it's a little little more serious than a cold a father or tonight there's no hard case with you and and you look at it all the same it's just an invading infirmity just the spirit that would try to touch our brother's body but you sent your word to heal us and father in the name of Jesus let me have a little more oil I'm gonna put something behind his ear now this might make you
