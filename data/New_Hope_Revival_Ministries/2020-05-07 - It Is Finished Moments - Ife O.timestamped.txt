[0:00] you've got to get your eyes above all
[0:03] the whispers that may be going on about
[0:06] your life I want you to know our God has
[0:17] all power and he has all authority and
[0:21] there is nothing not even cancer can
[0:24] stand against the price that he paid in
[0:27] the atonement he finished the work and
[0:30] he did a glorious job and he's still
[0:34] alive today and he still has power to
[0:37] save and heal and to deliver and he's
[0:41] still giving to a people authority and
[0:43] power to bind up a strongman to lay some
[0:48] chains on him and remind him you are
[0:52] ultimately defeated not because a bride
[0:56] has risen up you were defeated before
[0:59] you ever got started how many of you
[1:03] believe God saw the devil's ultimate
[1:06] defeat before he ever existed
[1:09] that's the sovereignty of our God and
[1:13] you hear people say when the enemy comes
[1:16] around and reminds you of your past you
[1:19] remind him of his future that's not just
[1:22] a cute little phrase that works well on
[1:25] social media it is a reality he is
[1:28] defeated he's going to tumble for a
[1:31] thousand years in a bottomless pit he's
[1:34] going to have a short reprieve out of
[1:37] that pit according to the word and then
[1:40] he's going to be ultimately banished to
[1:42] a lake of fire never to be able to
[1:45] bother the children of the Most High
[1:47] again never to be able to afflict to
[1:50] make sick to trouble to torment to
[1:53] oppress or to possess ever again
[1:57] and why do we know this because the word
[1:59] said so and what gave us that power I'd
[2:03] hope that we can grab ahold of that
[2:05] it is finished it is a done deal
[2:11] it is a finished work why brother Shelly
[2:15] don't we see more results and why don't
[2:19] we see more evidence that the enemy is
[2:23] defeated
[2:24] it's because we are failing to
[2:27] appropriate what is in our life but the
[2:31] biggest reason we have this morning is
[2:33] we listen to his accusation we listen to
[2:38] his lie and we must believe it because
[2:41] we lay down like dogs when he starts
[2:44] howling I want you to know when the
[2:47] enemy's nipping at your heel that is not
[2:49] the time to lay down and get fleas with
[2:51] him that's the time to stand up and say
[2:53] wait a minute wait a minute your
[2:58] authority is limited it's limited by the
[3:02] allowance of a living God and it's
[3:05] limited by the permission of the sons of
[3:07] God the enemy with everything he has he
[3:10] is determined to pull you out of God's
[3:12] endtime economy he is that's exactly
[3:17] what he want you to he cannot change
[3:18] your election he cannot change your
[3:20] predestination he cannot change your
[3:23] justification he cannot come on but I'll
[3:27] tell you what he can do he can move you
[3:29] out of the place of authority and
[3:33] understanding the power he can Mosul you
[3:38] like an ox he can arrest you in a rat
[3:43] until you realize this is his trick he
[3:46] I'll tell you what he's not gonna pull a
[3:48] atomic bomb and drop it on your house he
[3:52] doesn't have to do that to get control
[3:55] over you all he has to do is lie to your
[3:58] mind
[4:00] he just has to tell you a big old fat
[4:03] juicy law and we just fall right under
[4:07] his spell you've got to get your eyes
[4:09] above all the whispers that may be going
[4:13] on about your life you've got to know
[4:16] and be confident that God hears the
[4:19] prayer the effectual fervent prayer of a
[4:23] righteous man or woman availeth much and
[4:27] it's not your righteousness it's not my
[4:31] righteousness that causes my petition to
[4:34] ascend above through the second heaven
[4:37] into the throne room of the Most High
[4:39] God
