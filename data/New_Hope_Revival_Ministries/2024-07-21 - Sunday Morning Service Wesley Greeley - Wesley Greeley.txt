are under the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is everyone that continu with not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for the just shall live by faith no man is deemed righteous if he tries to keep the instruction because the just shall live by faith amen verse 12 and the law is not of Faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree that The Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith Brethren I speak after the manner of men though it be but a man's Covenant yet if it be confirmed no man dis anth or addeth thereto now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ and this I say that the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was 430 years after cannot disol that it should make the promise of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise wherefore then serveth the law it was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word today you may have your seats this is going to seem maybe a bit strange but I'd like for you to turn with me to Genesis chapter 3 Genesis 3 verse 1 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yay hath God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said to the woman you shall not surely die for God does know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as God's knowing Good and Evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves a and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God Among the Trees of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where are you and he said I heard your voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told you that you were naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should us not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou Hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shal thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel I want you to take a moment to notice in verse 14 that when God cursed the serpent he said that you are cursed above all the cattle now we know by Revelation that the serpent specie was an upright being we have come to understand very close to the human yet without a soul and this upright specie was cursed above all of the beasts of the field meaning the cattle are still upright the beasts of the wild are they they go about on on four feet but this particular species was put on his belly and the Bible says that he would go upon his belly and that he would eat dust all of the days of his life that was the curse that was placed upon him a declaration of words that was placed upon him now I have often wondered myself this is a preacher wondering here I have often wondered when God cursed that particular serpent from that time obviously they were all on their belly but was all the rest of the serpent population put on their belly at that moment could be might not be I don't know just something that a preacher has thought about before and I'd like know the answer but I don't have but I know that from that moment the specie was on its belly there is no serpent speechy that's upright today all right then verse 16 unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee now this was God's plan from that moment because the woman being the weaker vessel she was given this part of even though the word curse is not used here he said I'm going to greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception in sorrow you're going to bring forth children and your desire is to be toward your husband now I know that we live in a day when women's rights is rampant and we see that even in the churches even though the scripture uh shows that a woman is not to teach or to usurp Authority we see that it is very uh much happening in the church World At Large where that ladies women are being put in as preachers as pastors and I I've watched now for several years in particular the United Methodist Church that has has most uh put in the most of the women for ministers and you have watched as that church has gone closer and closer and closer to this uh this homosexual uh perversion where that they are allowing it in every aspect so much so until the denomination split and I I really have no stones to throw I'm making an observation to say that a woman has that that more tender side to her and when she's in a place of authority there begins to be compromise because of that heartfelt nature that she has toward children and when the children begin to get off when they when they start going to their own devices the mother's uh the mother's typical nature is still to embrace and to love and that is why there should not be women in the Pulpit enough of that verse 17 and Adam said unto Adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake the serpent was cursed put on the ground eat dirt the rest of his life the woman was told that she would be her sorrow would be greatly multiplied and the conception would be of sorrow but to the man he said cursed is the ground for your sake in sorrow you shall eat of it all the days of your life thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field in the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground for out of it you were taken dust you are and to dust you will return now he told the serpent he was going to eat dust and now he's telling the man that you started out his dust I took you from the dust and you're going to go back to dust what I want you to catch from what I have just read in this scripture is the man was not cursed the seed was not cursed the ground was cursed all right so we see that the ground had a curse on it which meant that it wasn't going to bring forth as easily as it would have in time in in previous time before the curse before the fall it was not going to bring forth in the same manner of which it would have previously and so it was going to take the sweat of the brow in order for man to be able to get the crop to grow and not only that he was going to have to contend with thorns and thistles prickly things things that he did not want growing in his vegetable patch even though he SED good seed he's still having to deal with the wheed s of the thorn and the thistle all right so now I'd like for us to look at uh uh some things that when when the law came uh through Moses I want us to look in Deuteronomy chapter 27 starting with verse 14 I want us to just look at a few things how that through the law there was a curse verse 14 the Levites shall speak and say unto all all the men of Israel with a loud voice cursed be the man that maketh any Graven or molten image an Abomination unto the Lord the work of the hands of the Craftman and putteth it in a secret place and all the people shall answer and say Amen now God put in place by the law cursed be the man that that maketh a Graven or a molten image the work of the hands of a Craftsman now we can get a picture in our mind of a wooden Idol we can get a picture in our mind of a metal Idol uh we can think about the New Testament where that Paul was having to deal with the copper Smith and the silver smith and all of these on Mars Hill was having to deal with these that we're building them with our hands but I want us to also think about the the Abominations that we have built in our own mind there have been periods in our life where we have not gone in our secret uh room and had this wooden object that we started focusing our attention on but we have had Abominations in our head we have had we have had a a a a work of the hands of a Craftsman we crafted it we were the ones that put it all together by the will of our imagination by our reasonings by whatever Avenue it got there but we had to tear it down secret place I can't tell what's in your head and you can't tell what's in mine but we have built through our lives some abominable things so we don't want to just put this all on the people that had a wooden object that they were looking at verse 16 cursed be he that sth light by his father and mother and all the people shall say all right we we got to be careful that we honor our father and mother no matter how unruly they are no matter how awful they are no matter what they are we can find something to honor them with verse 17 cursed be he that removeth his neighbor's landmark and all of the people shall say Amen let's just put it in modern terms because we're not living in in now we we have property markers and and you can try your hand at going and trying to remove property markers if you wish to but somewhere in a government Courthouse there are some layout lines and pins that that even if you remove them there are uh um surveyors that have the ability to get those pins back in their rightful place there are many of people who have thought that they own property because that the line had been moved but a new survey revealed that that really wasn't so and so this is a case in the natural of removing a neighbor's Landmark but let's get it a little more detailed into terminology uh in in the spirit because there are people who have a tendency that when you start making a move toward God and you put down your marker you put down by the promise of God you put down your landmark marks there's always somebody that wants to come and yank that Landmark up they want to take it up and say the days of Miracles are passed you don't need shouting and speaking in tongues you don't need all the gifts of the Spirit we're in a new day but that's somebody that's removing the neighbor's landmarks if that's the landmark you want for yourself you go right ahead and put that Landmark down but as for me in my house we will will serve the Lord and I have put down some landmarks that need to stay in place and if the Holy Ghost comes and says that you're you're not dreaming big enough you're not putting big enough landmarks in place and he says he says to enlarge your borders then by the Holy Ghost we'll pull up the landmark and we'll make the property bigger but if if somebody comes along usually they're not trying to make it bigger usually they're trying to make it smaller they're trying to make it less for you but cursed be he that removeth his neighbor's landmarks and all the people shall say cursed be he that maketh the blind to wonderer out of the way and all the people shall say Amen now we can you we can again we can this was no doubt for the naturally somebody that could not see with their eyes but friends I tell you there are a lot of people that are blinded spiritually and if we at all try to lead them astray because they are blind or if we even say it ain't even for them now are we causing them to wander out of the way what we really need to be doing is shining the light of the Gospel in their path Shining the light out of us letting the light that is in us the let it coming up and out of us until that it lights their path until their spiritual blindness can be done away with and they can find their way into the goodness of God and all the people shall say Amen cursed be he that perverteth the Judgment of the stranger the fatherless and the Widow and all the people shall say amen I think we have talked before about how that we have a we have a uh a responsibility even in the New Testament to take care of the fatherless and the Widow and that we should be on their side and not pervert the Judgment that might be against them but be able to help them along the way verse 20 cursed be he that lith with his father's wife because he uncover his father's skirt and all the people people shall say cursed be he that lith with any manner of Beast and all the people shall say I don't understand I don't get it but it is an increased mentality in 2024 because why why would that even be why would it even be it's because that people have turned God down so much till the Bible says that they're turned over to a reprobate mind and when you have a reprobate mind you do things that you never thought you would do in a million years but because that the enemy is on a rampage and he's causing young people to to drink and to smoke and to take drugs and it Alters their mind they begin to do things and and and and the the natural desire of a man is changed and rather than wanting to be with a woman he wants to be with it this is this is this is stuff that we maybe shouldn't even talk about in a mixed crowd but I tell you God still has this uh curse in place all of these things really are still in place friends sir we'll get to the rest of the story in the moment I'm trying to lay something out here for you cursed be he that lith with any man or beast verse 22 cursed be he that lith with his sister the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother and all the people shall say will you forgive me if I add to the word because I think that we could go even further with a daddy and his daughters or a mother and her sons or any of that kind of nonsense pedophilia verse 23 cursed be he that lith with his mother-in-law and all the people shall say cursed be he that smiteth his neighbor secretly and all the people shall say cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person and all the people shall say am you know we we are kind of sheltered in the fact that we don't really see this kind of thing taking place but there is still Mafia type people that do this kind of thing when there is somebody standing in the way in this dog eat dog world where that they slay with slay they would take money to slay an innocent person to get to a place of Authority or power because that that P that other person is in the way they might would pay money uh it it no doubt happens in politics it no doubt happens in the political world it no h no doubt happens in the drug culture and it happens all around the world but the Lord is put it in the law cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person and all the people shall say Amen cursed be he that confir not all the words of this law to do them so if you you would not partake in any of those things that I've just read but yet you would refuse to confirm the words of the law with an amen then you're cursed too so that means that people that say I'm just going to lay out a church I'm just going to you know kind of remain neutral at the work you got to take one side or the other either you're going to be part of the cursed crowd or you're going to be part of the bless crowd that's just who he is because God is as as brother Shelly was preaching God is not a mixer he is a separator and he is the one that brings separation into our life and he doesn't want us to have all of this mixture in it he wants us to be separated unto himself Deuteronomy 21: 22 and 23 if a man have committed a sin worthy of death any of these things that we've just read if if if a man's committed a sin worthy of death and he be put to death and thou hang him on a tree his body shall not remain all night upon the tree but Thou shalt in any wise bury him that day for he that is tanged is a cursed of God that thy land be not defiled which the Lord thy God giveth for an inheritance so all of us as long as the law was in place all of us if we trespassed on any of these things we were cursed and friends we might would like to think that we could overcome every bit of that in our own will and our own strength living under the law and there were men and women that aspired to that they they reached for it but they found themselves no doubt of failing in one place or another because it was the law it was the law that was put down because men had God knew that men would trespass pass he knew every one of us would trespass from the Garden of Eden when the first man and woman trespassed when they fell uh because of a beguiling spirit because of a spirit that came and and seduced them into doing things now the Bible said that that the woman was the one that was seduced she was the one that was deceived Adam was not deceived he partook willingly to cover his wife this is of course the picture of the Lord Jesus Christ who took on him the sins of us all because he knew that we the weaker vessel the woman the bride the woman she was the weaker vessel and she would be the one who would fall he was not going to fall but he knew that we were going to fall but he had a predestinated will for our lives now if you are sitting here or out across the camera uh I don't see how that you can read the New Testament and and not uh uh see that he has a predestinated will by his forn knowledge and and the more that I go along uh you know it's it's it's it's like the brother said last night was he was giving his testimony you know God he he said we had to have faith and he knew I couldn't get enough and so he gave it to me he said without faith it is impossible to please God and I can't muster up none on my own but the the Bible said to every man is given a Measure of Faith I didn't give it to you your preachers didn't give it to you God is the only one that can give you that Measure of Faith but he's the one that said you had to have it to start with so he made a way for you to have it and he knew that you couldn't overcome the curse by yourself so he in his beautiful Plan before you ever got here he had a plan in place because he didn't want you to live under the curse of the law he didn't want you to live under the weight of the law the law is weighty it holds us down to a point where that we feel like that we can move lest you should misunderstand me God has a law a law that is still in place today we do not do away with the Old Testament we believe what he said in the Old Testament in the old Covenant and that he brought it forward and made it more clear to us in the newer Covenant and in some places made it even heavier than it was before yet he understood that the blood of bulls and goats could never take the guilt and the condemnation away from the people it could never lift that heavy burden off of them so he already had this plan in place because of the law where he said any man that hangs on a tree is a curse and yet he came and he took on him the iniquity of us all all of your sin all of your shame past present and future every bit of it he took it upon himself that day at Calvary as he was walking toward Calvary as he started his Earthly Ministry he was taken on him he was seeing the sin that was around him the degraded mindset of the people he saw it everywhere he went and he spoke the word of Truth wherever he went and he spoke it with such conviction that men hated him for it because and then the men that hated him the most were the religious men men that had been trying to live under the weight of the law for years and years they lived under that weight and they just were trying to put it on the people but not living it themselves and as with men they decided that the law of God was not enough they had to build some fences and they began expanding the law and Jesus called them Traditions not all Traditions are wrong but Jesus said because of your Traditions you have made men to trespass because of your Traditions you have made men do things that they didn't have to do and Jesus began preaching to them but all of the while he's taking on the weight on the weight of this sinful world as he's going toward the cross he knows the end but he's still day by day laying down his will to in order to get to the finality of it the cross the execution stake the place where that he would end all of your pain all of your suffering all of your shame all of your condemnation all of your guilt well brother I feel awful guilty today how how do you figure that he ended it all either you believe the word or you don't then you might ask me have you never felt guilty oh yes I have felt guilty I have felt condemnation I have felt I have felt pain I have felt I've I've experienced all of the things we just talked about but when he went to the Cross when he hung on the execution stake he did it for me and he did it for you so that I did not have to live under the curse of the law here's our issue even after we come to the knowledge of the truth even after we say Lord I I need you to forgive me of all of my sins I have sinned against you I've sinned against your people and I'm asking continue to forgive me and we have to come with a repentant heart toward him we must but when we after we have accepted him as our Lord and our savior remember he took the curse away he took the curse away he reversed the curse sometimes this is hard for us to get our minds around because we still see so much curse we still see people that are trespassing the law of God and we at times still do foolish things things that go against the knowledge of God against his goodness in our lives and we create again we create Abominations up here in secret places we create these Abominations and it's not God's fault the curse has already been lifted right through what he did at Calvary now you remember when when when God came to the man and the woman in the garden he told Adam the man he said the ground is cursed the seed wasn't cursed the ground was cursed the thorns and the thistles were seed they were what they were from the beginning the maple tree was a seed but it was what it was from the beginning an apple tree a piece of cor a cornstalk a wheat stalk all of it was the seed there was nothing wrong with the seed but the ground was cursed the Bible tells us in Matthew chapter 13 that the word of God is a seed and when the seed of the word of God comes to us it is coming to a fleshly body that must go back to the dirt and it is dealing with the spirit the soul and the body there's nothing wrong with the seed and I may have preachers to disagree with me yet I'm going to say that the problem is the ground the problem is the ground because I don't know about you but my soul is still being uh it's the by the blood of Jesus Christ by the power of the work at the cross of Calvary my my ground the curse is being reversed it is being reversed because of Calvary because of the power of the work on the execution stake he's not finished with me yet so here I am 54 years old and and been been saved now for 35 years and and pressing into the goodness of God and it's not the seed's fault it's not the problem of the seed somewhere along the way there's been poison poison you know all of my life I've heard about the the the tragedy of the soldiers that went to Vietnam and the the the the atrocities that they dealt with and and how they came back with uh all kinds of ailments and they didn't know what to do with them and then they started talking about this agent orange and this agent orange was used this poison they would spray all of the foliage because the I believe it was the Viet Kong that were hiding in the in the foliage and so they sprayed all of the foliage to try to expose them and it killed everything in sight and it caused there to be a reaction in physical bodies both Vietnamese and our our guys as well now St comes with his poison and just because that you got saved the enemy didn't quit shooting his poison and just because you got saved and you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it doesn't mean that all of the ground was 100% ready for seed because you know as well as I know that we have spit some things out before before we have refused the seed because the ground was a little bit corrupt it was cursed there was there was still some levels of the curse that was there but I'm here to tell you today that the blood of Jesus Christ the cross of Calvary the work at the cross of Jesus Christ revers The Curse we've heard the phrase salvation is free it is but to live for Christ will cost you everything everything and I find myself the older I get and the closer that I get to him and the more of the word of God that I hear I find myself saying Lord I give you everything because I realize that there was something that I held back yesterday and something that I held back the day before and he doesn't even always reveal what it is he doesn't reveal it always but I realize that I held something back and that I'm still struggling with the the curse that's on the ground I'm still struggling with that curse because I'm not agree being with him I find myself in an atmosphere with you and I find that I could agree with him on everything I get out from under the atmosphere and I go out in life and I find that there are things that have pools that have pools that have pulls because the ground is still cursed and I'm not agreeing with him that the curse is reversed still deal dealing with the mind the will and the emotion he paid the price friends he did it all at Calvary he paid the price so that you could overcome smoking so that you could overcome drinking so that you could overcome drug addiction so that you could overcome beastiality so that you could overcome homosexuality so that you could overcome pedophilia so that you could overcome pornography so that you could overcome the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eye and overcome the pride of life he went to Calvary and he overcame all of it he did there is no question about it in my mind today he overcame all of it and the Bible said that he was tempted in all manner as we are so somewhere along the way he had to deal with all of it for what kind of period of time I don't know how long his temptation was I don't know but this one thing I know when he got to Calvary when he when he was hanging on calvary's cross and he said it is finished on him was every sin every shame every iniquity every backsliding condition every bit of it was hanging on him and he said it is fath finished and he died now had that been the end of it it would not have helped us but the Bible tells us that he descended into the lower parts of the earth and that he led captivity captive and gave gifts to men and what was that gift that he gave unto men all of those that were previous to the cross of Calvary those that had lived under the law the best they knew how and they kept Covenant with almighty God they reive the same salvation that you and I receive but that that wasn't the all of it all of that curse all of that sin all of that iniquity all of the shame all of the guilt and the condemnation the stuff the stuff that we carry around today that weights us down so much friends he took it back to hell where it belong bels he did not take it back to the Heavenly portals of Glory with him he descended first and he took all of the weight of everything that you've ever carried or ever will carry and he took it back to hell where it belongs and he put it back on the devil and he took the keys of death hell and the grave all of it he took the keys so that means that the devil does not really have authority in your life he only has Authority by what I give him that's how he plays around in our lives that how that's how he gets us messed up in our mind that's how he causes us to build abom ations in our mind Idols in our mind because we've agreed with him we have agreed with him that our ground is still cursed we have agreed with him that we're still walking under a curse but the Lord Jesus came to reverse the curse and because I am a predestinated believer in the end time I have the authority as well to reverse that curse in my life and you have the ability to reverse the curse in your life but you and I and anybody else has to agree with the word you we have to agree with the fact that the curse has been reversed and that the way that has been protected by the sword in the garden the way to the tree of life that has been protected by the Flaming sword that same sword is now driving us to the tree of life because the curse has been lifted off of us the curse is reversed yet we agree with the curse the Declaration that is put over us the curse of the law is a prayer or a declaration for injury for harm or for Misfortune and if the law is what you're going to follow the law you're going to have to pray pay the price of the law anybody that wants to walk under the law of the old Covenant don't misunderstand me if you want to walk under the law of the old Covenant without the blood of Jesus Christ there is a declaration or a prayer for your injury for your harm or for your Misfortune if you trespass we read all of the curses if you do this you're cursed if you do this you're cursed if you do this all of that curse has already been declared that there is a if if you do the deed you get the curse but when Calvary happened we know by the word that the lamb was slain from before the foundation of the world and all of those that were under the law I believe that by the forn knowledge of God he knew all of those that would follow the law as well as those that would be mixers and those that would go their own way and those that would you know it reminds me as I was listening to the brother's testimony last night there where we were he talked about the hold that drugs and alcohol and rock music had on his life and the law said that if a child was disobedient and would not walk in a way that was right that he was to be Stone but under the New Covenant there's Grace under the newer Covenant and under the revelation of this message that we have in the end time we have been told to hold the token over our families we've been told to hold the token over what does that look like what does holding the token over over them well the first thing that we got to do is we got to pray for them and we've got to live holy and godly in front of them for them to have something to Aspire to so if you live like the devil in your house and expect your children to do better that ain't really fair to them you're not training them I don't care if you tell them this is what the Bible said that's not training them if you tell them not to smoke pot but here you are smoking it that is not training them if you tell them not to watch pornography but yet you're doing it that is not training them training them is living it in front of them and explaining from the scripture why we do what we do why we live like we live explain and getting them an atmosphere where that they can also be trained by the preaching of the word it's not all of the preachers job to train your children God gave you your children for you to train he gave me mine for mine to me to train and my wife and we all fail miserably at times yet we continue to press forward to try to train our children in the way that they should go so that when they're older they will not depart from it and we pray by God's grace that they never go out and experience anything of this world then people get this mentality well they got to have a battle sometime I promise you I promise they're going to have battles you want me to put it in planer terms what is the phrase that we always say Church hurt is the worst hurt and if they're part of a body they're going to experience some things along the way because it's part of it's part of iron sharpening iron my wife tells me you tell the people that you pass one test and the next one's harder she said it's not exactly that way you pass a test because you're going to take all that you've learned from the past and you're going to be able to take that knowledge that understanding that overcoming and you're going to be able to step into the next test so that e even though it may seem like that there there's there's things in there that you've not yet experienced but what you have accumulated from the past is going to give you the grace and the strength and the courage to say I've got this one there may be a couple little problems that I I've got to figure out I've got to I've got to have some understanding but I'm going to take what I've learned from the past I'm going to bring it up to this test and I'm going to be able to figure out these problems too because all of that overcoming I've done in the past is only helping me that I can overcome now I'm going to pass the test because Jesus passed the test and Jesus lives in me but I would now here's the problem that I have because that I I've already said that we we have this problem because the ground is cursed but the curse has been reversed there a hang on a minute as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God there's a scripture that I'm trying to grasp that that that uh to them gave he the power to become the sons of God but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of Flesh nor of the will of man but of God so as many as received him that's you that's me we received him we received him into our lives and as we received him we he gave us the power to become the sons of God and we're not earning our way into becoming sons of God because on over in the Scripture it tells us that that to them he did for no he did also predi destinate them to be conformed into the image of his own Dear Son and the the image of his own dear son was that his son went all the way to Calvary and although the curse was laid upon him he gave up his own will and he took that curse to hell and there he left it and he ascended to the right hand of the father and because that he accomplished all of that he has Mercy On The Mercy Seat the blood is still on the mercy seat and I am partaking of that blood I am partaking of the power of that blood I am partaking of that because I hear him say to as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of God what do sons of God do do they meddle around in the law do they build Abominations do they continue to agree with the cursed ground no sons of God those that are sons of God they agree with what has already been done the curse that has been reversed the curse has already been taken on to Christ he took the curse and the curse he took with him to Hell the Earth still has its curse on it the Natural Earth still has its curse on it this still has its curse on it if you disagree with that I just like to say that I hope you have some death insurance place somewhere because the curse on this is still here but this curse that has been on the minds the wills and the emotions of people through ages and generations the Lord Jesus took that curse to hell and he left it there yet we find ourselves agreeing with that curse friend you don't have to you don't have to agree with that curse for your emotions that get so out of balance for your personality that is so sharp or jokester always jesting you don't have to agree with it just because you're daddy was and your daddy your granddaddy was and his dad was you don't have to agree with it you don't have to carry the personality of another [Music] generation if if it is unkind if it is OB obnoxious you don't have to carry it because the curse was taken to Hell the curse has been reversed and he wants us to agree with him now don't get yourself all out of shape with me saying that when I say the curse is reversed if Jesus Took The Curse I'm still dealing with it because I don't totally agree with him you don't why would you say such a thing preacher you don't either you don't either oh yes preacher I agree with the Lord till somebody makes you mad somebody runs you off the road till you find out your child has dabbled in something that you know they shouldn't yet it is finished our ground that was cursed is only cursed if we curse it now what is a curse a prayer of Declaration or or a declaration for injury harm or Misfortune now all I'm saying is what has already been said said the words of our mouth were either blessing or cursing and the seed is not cursed and the ground doesn't have to be because Jesus Took the curse to hell and left it there so we continue cultivating picking up rocks better ever picked up rocks out of a field one of the worst jobs I remember as a young person when the neighbors would plow the field and then disc the field and then they would say will you help me to pick up rocks and every year there were rocks to pick up even though the field had previously been plowed and disced and planted if it got plowed and disced and planted the Rocks came up again I'm amazed at the farming techniques used today there's no plowing there's no discing that none of that they cut a crop and they plant a new one special Machinery but we would pick up rocks and we got rocks that are in the way we've allowed things and it has caused things to grow crooked we need to pick up some rocks and we need to let the word become nourishment in our in the soil of our of our minds our will our motion we need to let we need to let the word become uh uh nutrients to put uh life back in the soil and that is exactly what it has been doing yet we continue to pronounce curse we put a misfortune on ourselves we don't have to because Jesus took it all at Calvary and he gave the remedy for us to be able to walk under the blessing of heaven and when he gave the blessing in the Old Testament he had this pronounced onto the people and he told them that the the blessing shall come on you and overtake you if you shall hearken unto the voice of the Lord your God and that's what we do when we hear the word we receive it and we allow it to bring nutrients into the ground so that the seed can continue doing what it needs to do and we agree with his voice and so then he said in Deuteronomy chapter 28 starting in verse three blessed shall you be in the city and blessed shall you be in the field blessed shall you be shall be the fruit of the body and the fruit of your ground and the fruit of your cattle and the increase of your kind and the flocks of your sheep blessed shall be the basket and thy store blessed shall thou be when you come in and blessed shall you be when you go out the Lord shall cause your enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face they shall come out against thee one way and flee before thee seven ways not by you running them off the road not by you punching them in the face not by you using your voice of sarcasm no it is because that you allow the word of God to bring nutrients to you and then these seeds are planted in you and they grow with uh such fervor and you remember in the New Testament he said some of them would bring 30 fold some 60 and some H hundredfold and and that is because of the nutrition of the soil that they're planted in so he says you're going to you're if your enemy Rises up against you he's going to be smitten before your face they shall come out before thee one way and flee before the seven ways now might I remind you that we do not fight Flesh and Blood hear somebody's voice say I do well you're going to walk in the cursed ground let the Holy Ghost see friends there there's we say we receive the Holy Ghost but do you know what we need more than the Holy Ghost Blasphemous John said when he comes he's going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire that's what some of us need we need the fire of the Holy Ghost to come and burn some things out of us to burn all the underbrush to burn some thorns and this oh I know he said let the tears grow up together but I've had some harvests along the way yes sir but I realized that I've not had the hundredfold Harvest that I really desire to have and so I need some of the Holy Ghost and Fire to come in my life and burn some things out of me that I did not know were in there I need some of the fire of God to burn out some of the tormenting spirits that have been inside of me I need the Holy Ghost in fire to burn some of the demon things out of my life that I've allowed to remain there and I kept pronouncing the curse over it and the curse remain and so I've had to live with the curse and live with the curse and live with the curse because I didn't agree with the reversing of the curse of Calvary when he took it to hell and I've had to deal with it but oh that the Holy Ghost and Fire would descend upon us and he'd come by the power of the Holy Ghost and burn out of us all of that stuff that hinders the growth of the seed the problem is not with the seed it's because of some of that noncertified seed that we've allowed in our lives and because it's GMO and because it's hybrid because it's been genetically modified by the demon spirits of hell and we've allowed it into our lives and it seemed like that it had a a stronger ability to grow than the certified seed and we watched it grow and it got bigger than everything else and it was greener than everything else because it was what we kept watering but the certified seed is still there my friend if you've been under the sound of the word of God there's still some certified seed that have been planted in you you need the Holy Ghost and Fire the Lord shall command the blessing upon your storehouses and in all that you set your hand to he shall bless you in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee musicians can come verse n the Lord shall establish thee and holy people unto himself as he has sworn unto thee if you keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God and walk in his ways and all of the people of the Earth shall see that th are called by the name of the Lord and they shall be afraid of thee and the Lord shall make thee plenteous in Goods in the fruit of your body in the fruit of your cattle in the fruit of your ground in the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers to give thee has the Lord given you some land have you put down your landmarks then woe be to the man who comes and tries to remove the landmarks out of your land that's right you know how they get by with it cuz you agree with them something that you thought was established and you had put down a steak and somebody came along and gave you a better idea and they pulled up your steak and say I don't really think that's where it belongs and you began to agree with them and you let them put the stake down somewhere else oh friends I tell you get let the Holy Ghost and Fire get a hold of you today and let that steak let that Landmark be put down so that the Holy Ghost can put you plenteous in Goods in the fruit of your body in the fruit of your cattle in the fruit of your ground in the land which the Lord God gave you he called you to a particular location because he had a land he wanted to give to you don't let anybody remove the landmarks the Lord shall open up unto thee his good treasure the heaven to give the rain of the land and his season and to bless all the works of your hand and you shall lend unto many nations and thou shalt not borrow and the Lord shall make Thee the head and not the tail and thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath if you hearken unto the Commandments of the Lord thy God which I command unto thee this day to observe and to do them and shall not go aside from any of The Words which I command thee this day to the right hand or to the left to go after other gods other gods other gods other gods to serve them and then he goes on to talk talk about the curses which we've already covered but my Lord has reversed the curse he has reversed the curse do you need some Holy Fire of God today I believe that every believer could see some stuff in his or her life that he needs the fire of God to burn something out of him so that the ground that you have can become the fertile soil without any curse on it without you helping the curse by the words that you speak over to your own self or over your children but you speak life every time that you speak you're speaking life I speak life into the nutrients of the soil of my soul I speak life into it I speak life into the nutrients of of the food that I eat so that it becomes nourishment for my physical body friends we are living in the end time and I do believe that this is not just for the mind the will and the emotion the spirit is already taken care of that's settled by by the by the new birth but I believe that as we come nearer and nearer to the end time we have said before we are not leaving out of here as broken down sick people we are going out of here whole by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but we've got to make sure that our soil is ready to receive that seed and that we are speaking life over the soil right the sword is driving us back to the tree of life we're drinking from the Waters of the river uh uh the the rivers of the Water of Life freely he gave it to us he wants that the the nutrients that are in that River of Life to be inside of us and he wants us speaking over our beings life and health and goodness and kindness and meekness he wants all of that settled down over us and if we have something inside of us today that is still of the other direction of a cursed nature the Holy Ghost is here today to burn it out of us to burn it out of us in the name of Jesus Christ to burn it out of us let's stand together today my God my God I come to you today with Thanksgiving I thank you Lord for the fire of the Holy Ghost I thank you for the anointing of the Holy Ghost I thank you Lord that we don't have to only be in church or listening to music but God we can allow the fire of God to meet us in our time of prayer where God you can do something miraculous for us but while we're under the sound of this word today we say here am I Lord here am I let the coal from off the altar touch my lips oh Lord let it burn away all of the curse
