God has a plan and purpose for our lives, our destiny.  Our very existence is determined not by luck or chance, but by a Good God who is allowing things to come our way so He can bring us to higher Glory.  We can leave behind the mistakes and woundedness of our past, and by His grace and mercy He allows us to embrace Truth revealed and promises of His Word for 2022.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you are still a living attribute of god he cannot lose you how many of you are glad you're not living by chance you're not living by the draw the lucky draw you're living by a plan that god has laid out for our lives before we ever showed up here on this planet the good and the bad and the ugly now somebody said the whole world is churning trying to determine why bad things happen to good people i'm telling you this god is sovereign god has a plan if you'll just hold on to him you'll find out before it's over that he didn't forsake you he didn't forget you you didn't fall out of his love you didn't fall out of his care he allowed these things to come your way because he's bringing you to a higher glory he's bringing you to a place where you can meet him where he stands he stands today on the promised word for this year and god wants you to be able to meet him there you can't meet god in 2022 if you're still living in 2021 you can't meet god for what he wants to do for us this year if you're still living in 1950 you've got to catch up the reason why we get behind and we don't catch up is we're still trying to go and sort out all the things that happened to us why did that happen well why did that happen what if i'd done this but i want you to know your life your very existence your tomorrow your today is not in the hands of educated men it's not in the hands of a good hospital it's not in the hands of a good doctor your life is in the hands of a good god you say well i'm going through some stuff that's not good you may be 100 telling it just like it is you may be going through something that's not good at all but i'll tell you what the bible said he works all things for the good when you're at your worst when you're so rotten you stink your attitude's foul you've grumbled more than you praised you are still a living attribute of god he cannot lose you he will not lose you he will chase you he will pursue you he will wrap his arms around you until you surrender again to the life that he has chosen for you one that is not by luck not by chance not by happenstance so you may think that this is a mistake and that's been a mistake and that's been a mistake i want you to know these things that have happened along the way could absolutely be god bringing us somewhere taking us somewhere we may not see the message until we're sitting down one day with our mind on him and it hits us like a thunderbolt oh now that makes sense
