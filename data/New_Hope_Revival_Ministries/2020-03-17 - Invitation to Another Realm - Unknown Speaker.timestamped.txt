[0:04] we call revelation the last book of the
[0:07] Bible the book of symbols because God
[0:10] gave John caught him up in the spirit
[0:15] where there is no time and in the spirit
[0:19] he could see eternity in both directions
[0:22] that's powerful
[0:24] and he was given symbols of things that
[0:28] were happening in his present time that
[0:31] he didn't know anything about understand
[0:33] and he was shown symbols that would
[0:36] continue to represent God's plan for man
[0:40] all the way up to the last age john
[0:44] living in the first church age and yet
[0:47] God let him see symbols that would
[0:50] represent God's great plan for mankind
[0:54] all the way through seven Church ages
[0:57] all the way up to the last of the last
[0:59] days and all of that was available to
[1:02] John because he yielded to an invitation
[1:06] come up come on I love that you know I
[1:10] don't really believe that dimensions are
[1:13] stacked on top of one another and realms
[1:17] on top of one another even though it's
[1:19] described this way and symbol in the
[1:21] Bible we first have in second heaven
[1:23] third heaven but I understand that more
[1:27] likely these things are running parallel
[1:30] is that too too strange for you and
[1:33] really in other words John could have
[1:38] just stepped into another realm had God
[1:42] opened the veil and that's what he was
[1:44] trying to do but I love the terminology
[1:47] come up and what that says to me is you
[1:51] got to get up above all the weights all
[1:55] the problems all the heartaches all the
[1:58] baggage of your present lot John could
[2:01] have really you know he could have been
[2:03] feeling sorry for himself
[2:05] I mean after surviving those other
[2:10] attempts on his life he's banished to
[2:12] Pat
[2:13] and they fully believed that he would
[2:16] die many believe they were wild beasts
[2:18] on that island and that prisoners had
[2:21] been sit there and I think there's even
[2:24] history that says that that new
[2:26] prisoners had been banished there and
[2:28] killed by old prisoners that they
[2:31] thought had already died but had somehow
[2:33] survived a little longer in caves and
[2:36] whatever else and so really there were
[2:38] so many unknowns to the Isle of Patmos
[2:42] at that time I guess John could have
[2:44] really said lord have you forgotten me
[2:47] you let me live to to have me thrown out
[2:51] here in the wilderness but I'm so glad
[2:54] that John was able to get up above his
[2:58] present aches and pains and feelings of
[3:01] rejection if indeed he had any feeling
[3:04] like God had forsaken him he was able to
[3:07] push through all the stuff the muck and
[3:11] the mire to heed a call come up higher
[3:16] John I'm giving you an invitation to
[3:20] another realm to another dimension
[3:23] where all things are possible God is a
[3:29] supernatural God his desire is to
[3:34] release in his people supernatural life
[3:38] it's more than just eternal life it's a
[3:42] doorway into a realm I want to say it
[3:46] again where all things are possible come
[3:51] go with me on this journey of faith I'm
[3:55] not going to fool around with you and
[3:58] I'm not going to tell you that this
[4:00] Christian journey is all mountaintops
[4:04] and you know babbling brooks and sunny
[4:08] days there's going to be rainy days
[4:10] there's going to be foggy days there's
[4:14] going to be painful days tearful days
[4:17] but all I want you to know that you
[4:21] don't ever have to feel hopeless when
[4:25] you know
[4:26] Jesus Christ because in one minute he
[4:29] can take a hopeless situation and turn
[4:32] it completely around and I believe we
[4:35] can discover more possibility and more
[4:38] potential and more strategy by spending
[4:42] more time reaching for that unseen that
[4:47] spiritual realm that supernatural realm
[4:51] that that realm is a realm of reality
[4:55] it's a realm of power a realm of
[4:58] holiness and purity it's a realm of
[5:01] beauty it's a realm where God speaks to
[5:05] us oh yes I know the mainstream media
[5:10] loves to make fun of those who believe
[5:14] God talks to them you really they'll
[5:17] they'll ask like it you really but you
[5:20] really heard God speak to you they love
[5:24] to portray and paint people like that to
[5:28] believe they hear from God like they
[5:31] need a ward somewhere in a mental in a
[5:34] mental facility like they've all just
[5:36] lost their mind and they'll they'll
[5:40] never get it back they love to laugh and
[5:44] make fun but I want to tell you that
[5:47] according to the scripture if you're
[5:50] born again by the Spirit of God you
[5:54] should be able to hear the inner voice
[5:57] of God speaking to you not a chosen few
[6:01] not only those who might find themselves
[6:05] in office of apostle or profit but
[6:08] believer a Holy Spirit Holy Ghost filled
[6:11] born-again believer you have the promise
[6:15] of that deep knowing that comes from the
[6:20] voice of God it's more often that he
[6:24] speaks with an inner voice unknowing and
[6:29] I think it's that way on purpose I think
[6:34] that it teaches us maturity because we
[6:38] have to wait and
[6:40] discern and judge we have to take what
[6:44] that inner voice says and compare it
[6:47] with God's written authority the word
[6:49] and we have to make sure that this is
[6:52] not our soul our emotions our own mind
[6:56] but that God is really confirming
[6:59] something to us with an inner power with
[7:03] an inner voice oh my I hope that I hope
[7:07] that doesn't sound too strange the Bible
[7:11] tells us we will know that we are saved
[7:15] because there will be an inner
[7:17] quickening a making alive of our own
[7:20] spirit oh yes brother sister you can
[7:23] know that you're ready to meet God that
[7:26] that old hymn of the church blessed
[7:29] assurance Jesus is mine oh what a
[7:35] foretaste of glory divine because we are
[7:41] the heirs of salvation we have every
[7:44] right to claim that leadership of the
[7:48] Holy Spirit from the inside in order to
[7:54] be able to recognize that identify that
[7:57] and find grace to obey that leadership
[8:00] we're going to have to heed the
[8:03] invitation of the Lord come up come up a
[8:06] little higher step out of your present
[8:10] thought pattern and reality get out of
[8:12] your paradigm the the old humdrum of the
[8:17] usual and let me show you something
[8:21] bigger than what your mind would even be
[8:24] able to comprehend and so God doesn't
[8:27] deal with us from the supernatural realm
[8:30] in our mind he does that in our deep
[8:35] spirit a human spirit that has been
[8:39] regenerated by the breath of God I tell
[8:44] you it's powerful
[8:46] when we look scripturally with eyes that
[8:51] have been anointed with eyesalve for
[8:53] revelation when we look at just what it
[8:57] means to be born from heaven to be born
[9:01] again
[9:02] let me read here of a portion of
[9:06] Scripture in 2nd Peter chapter 1 verses
[9:11] 17 through 19 for he received from God
[9:15] the Father honor and glory when there
[9:18] came such a voice to him from the
[9:22] excellent glory this is my beloved Son
[9:26] in whom I am well pleased and this voice
[9:30] which came from heaven we heard we heard
[9:35] this is Peter being a witness we heard
[9:40] this voice and when we were with him in
[9:44] the holy mount verse 19 we have also a
[9:48] more sure word of prophecy where until
[9:51] you do well that you take heed as unto a
[9:53] light that shine a--the in a dark place
[9:55] until the day dawn and the day star
[9:58] arise in your hearts you and I were not
[10:03] physical witnesses to the ministry to
[10:06] the glory and the Transfiguration of the
[10:09] Lord Jesus Christ that day on the
[10:11] mountain but Peter was and he said we
[10:14] heard the voice now that proves to me
[10:17] right there that God can speak in an
[10:20] audible voice that more than one person
[10:23] can hear but I love what Peter said he
[10:27] wanted people not to Marvel or to be
[10:31] just you know enamored by the fact that
[10:34] he had heard the physical voice of God
[10:37] but he said but we have also a more sure
[10:42] word of prophecy where until you do well
[10:47] to take heed as unto a light that shine
[10:49] if in a dark place until the day dawn
[10:51] and the day star arise in your hearts I
[10:54] want you to know that if even if you
[10:58] should never hear an audible voice of
[11:00] God if you're born again of the Spirit a
[11:03] day star has risen
[11:06] your heart the light of Jesus Christ has
[11:10] penetrated the darkness and the sin and
[11:13] the unbelief that once crowded your
[11:16] heart and he has come to be king of all
[11:20] and Lord of all Lord over every
[11:25] circumstance over every disease over all
[11:29] bondage all darkness every knee I'm
[11:34] telling you there's there's an hour
[11:36] ahead where the scripture said every
[11:39] knee will bow wouldn't you want to be
[11:42] there in that moment when even Lucifer
[11:45] the fallen angel hasatan Satan we refer
[11:50] to him or the devil some people say he
[11:54] embodies all that is evil and was so
[12:00] created for a purpose and yet one day
[12:04] that
[12:05] old slewfoot he's been called will have
[12:09] to bow his knee and publicly declare in
[12:13] the presence of those who have been
[12:15] delivered from his hand and in the
[12:18] presence of those fooled deceived
[12:22] blinded by his plan he will have to
[12:26] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord of all
[12:31] to the glory of the Father can you
[12:35] imagine what that would be like if you
[12:38] were fooled by the devil seduced by the
[12:41] devil and then later you have to sit
[12:44] there and listen to him declare that the
[12:47] very thing he talked you out of is now
[12:50] the very thing that he believes that
[12:52] Jesus is Lord of all but that day is
[12:55] coming it's coming as sure as we are
[12:59] gathered here today it is coming and
[13:02] there's a safe place to be
[13:05] and that is in the Lord Jesus Christ I
[13:08] want you to know that he's real thank
[13:11] you for watching today
