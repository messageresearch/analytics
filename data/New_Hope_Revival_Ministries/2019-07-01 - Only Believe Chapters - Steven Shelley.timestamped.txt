[0:12] one of my very favorite scriptures in
[0:15] the Bible is Hebrews chapter 13 and
[0:17] verse 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[0:21] and today and forever it reminds us that
[0:26] everything that our Lord Jesus was able
[0:30] to accomplish in his earthly ministry he
[0:33] can still perform for us and even
[0:36] through us today when we look at the
[0:40] four Gospels and we read the beautiful
[0:43] words of truth the the unbelievable
[0:47] expressions of love the great miracles
[0:50] that took place in the very short period
[0:54] of his earthly ministry the Bible tells
[0:57] us that the world could not contain the
[1:00] volumes the books that could have been
[1:02] written about his earthly ministry when
[1:06] we look at that there's so much that can
[1:09] help us even in our lives today one of
[1:12] those places in Scripture that has
[1:14] inspired me recently is in mark chapter
[1:17] 5 where there are two outstanding
[1:20] miracles recorded in the Ministry of
[1:23] Jesus Christ one is we read of one whose
[1:28] name was gyrus he was a leader a ruler
[1:32] in the synagogue he had great religious
[1:36] position and even Authority he came to
[1:40] Jesus to tell him that his daughter was
[1:43] very ill and at the point of death and
[1:46] he was imploring the Lord please come
[1:49] and pray for my daughter she is even
[1:53] right now at the point of death and
[1:55] Jesus agrees to go with gyruss but I
[1:59] don't think they had gone very far
[2:01] before the scripture tells us that his
[2:04] journey was interrupted by a very
[2:07] desperate woman a woman that we all have
[2:11] heard about many times a woman with an
[2:14] issue of blood
[2:15] the Bible tells us that she had spent
[2:17] everything that she had to the
[2:21] physicians trying to get better hoping
[2:24] for a change
[2:26] but the Bible specifically tells us she
[2:29] rather grew worse when she heard of the
[2:32] Ministry of Jesus she said I've got to
[2:35] get to him if I can just touch the hem
[2:38] of His garment I know that I will be
[2:42] made whole there was a great crowd
[2:45] following Jesus everywhere he went and
[2:48] the crowd was thronging him and bumping
[2:51] him and brushing against him but all of
[2:53] a sudden Jesus stopped he knew that
[2:57] someone had touched him he perceived
[3:00] that virtue life had gone out of him and
[3:04] he turned to find out who it was it's
[3:08] almost like the disciples were a little
[3:10] bit making fun or laughing a little bit
[3:13] they said how is it that you would ask
[3:15] who touched you every one is touching
[3:18] you in the crowd but he explained there
[3:21] was something different about that touch
[3:23] it was a touch of faith it was a touch
[3:27] of desperation and I want you to know
[3:29] that Jesus responds to faith and he
[3:33] meets us at the point of our desperation
[3:37] that woman from that moment on was made
[3:41] completely whole I'm trying to imagine
[3:45] in my mind how gyruss was feeling I know
[3:48] that gyruss must have been concerned
[3:51] about this woman and her need and all of
[3:54] the others that were reaching out to
[3:56] Jesus but I think we're safe to assume
[3:59] that his daughter was foremost on his
[4:02] heart and in his mind I've got a feeling
[4:06] that in some way he was wishing that the
[4:09] Lord would hurry but he would rush
[4:11] because he knew that his daughter was
[4:14] just a few breaths away from death in
[4:17] fact the Bible tells us that as soon as
[4:20] Jesus spoke to this woman in mark 534
[4:25] and he said under
[4:27] daughter by faith hath made thee whole
[4:29] going peace and be whole of thy plague
[4:33] the Bible tells us in the next verse
[4:36] while Jesus was yet speaking a messenger
[4:40] from the house of Jairus came and said
[4:43] I'm here to tell you your daughter has
[4:47] died and there's no need to trouble the
[4:51] master any longer I want you to know
[4:55] that must have been very difficult news
[4:57] for gyruss to hear but I want you to
[5:01] listen at how this story plays out Jesus
[5:06] as soon as he heard the word that was
[5:10] spoken by the ruler of the synagogue he
[5:13] looks at gyruss and he says be not
[5:18] afraid only believe what powerful words
[5:24] be not afraid only believe that that's
[5:29] so powerful because we understand that
[5:33] fear is a hindrance to belief to faith
[5:38] if we can allow the Lord to calm our
[5:42] fears then our faith can rise above the
[5:46] circumstances and we can reach out like
[5:49] the little woman with the issue of blood
[5:51] or gyruss whose heart was greatly
[5:54] grieved by the news that he had just
[5:57] received and Jesus didn't want fear to
[6:01] stand in the way of faith so he spoke to
[6:06] his fear first and then he spoke of his
[6:09] faith don't be afraid only believe I
[6:13] wonder how many hundreds of times we
[6:16] have son that song only believe all
[6:19] things are possible and indeed that they
[6:24] are so Jesus and gyruss they continue on
[6:28] their journey to his home
[6:31] Jesus asked the crowd you remain here he
[6:35] takes with him his inner circle Peter
[6:38] James and John and when they get to the
[6:41] home they find a confusion and noise
[6:46] weeping and wailing going on you see if
[6:50] you look at the words of the servant
[6:53] your daughter is dead if you look at
[6:56] that in the original it could have said
[6:59] dead is your daughter which is very
[7:03] strong language and what that actually
[7:06] means is the funeral is already
[7:10] beginning that means as it was the
[7:15] custom in that time and still today
[7:18] among the Jewish people to bury a body
[7:22] almost immediately after death usually
[7:25] at least within 24 hours so what
[7:29] happened was as soon as the little girl
[7:31] had been examined there is no heartbeat
[7:34] there is no breath the mourners were
[7:37] already hired this was the custom to
[7:40] bring in mourners to weep and to cry and
[7:45] a wail so that everyone in the
[7:47] neighborhood would know there had been a
[7:49] death it means that the body of that
[7:52] precious little girl would have already
[7:54] been what we would probably call today
[7:57] embalmed meaning in that period her body
[8:01] was anointed with spices and precious
[8:05] oils and was wrapped in strips of cloth
[8:09] I guess that would sort of be like what
[8:12] we would think a mummy would look like
[8:14] so the funeral was already in
[8:17] progression when Jesus gets to the house
[8:21] and he said why are you carrying on and
[8:24] making such a big
[8:26] Adu what is going on here this little
[8:31] girl this daughter is not dead she's
[8:36] just asleep
[8:37] no wonder they laughed him to scorn how
[8:41] could he say that she had been
[8:43] thoroughly examined her body oiled and
[8:47] spiced and now wrapped with grave
[8:49] clothes they were just waiting on gyrus
[8:52] to come home so that they could take her
[8:54] out to the graveyard and bury her and
[8:57] Jesus calls it sleeping why because he
[9:01] saw through the confusion he saw through
[9:05] the noise he wasn't listening to the
[9:08] other voices this is a lesson for you
[9:11] and I we have to shut out all the other
[9:14] voices that tell us it's too late
[9:17] there's no hope death is sure to come
[9:21] they'll never come back to the Lord
[9:24] there's no healing available for you
[9:26] today I don't know what the voices are
[9:28] in your life but I know that the weeping
[9:32] and the mourning and the carrying on was
[9:34] certainly saying it's finished it's done
[9:37] it's over and Jesus sends them out
[9:40] got to get doubt out of the way got to
[9:43] get unbelief out of the room and he goes
[9:46] over and perhaps he has to unravel the
[9:49] grave clothes a little bit because the
[9:51] Bible said he reaches in and takes her
[9:53] hand and he raises her up and he says to
[9:56] her being interpreted the Bible said he
[9:59] said damsel I say unto thee arise and
[10:04] straightway the Bible said she not only
[10:06] arose but she got up and walked around
[10:09] she was twelve years old again the Bible
[10:12] tells us there and they were all
[10:13] astonished with a great astonishment I
[10:16] imagine they were a funeral already in
[10:20] procession and Jesus comes in and makes
[10:22] the difference I want to tell you today
[10:25] that we have to take heart take courage
[10:29] take strength when we read something
[10:32] like this this isn't a fairy tale or
[10:35] just a story this is a
[10:37] heard of the power that Jesus has not
[10:43] had he's the same I don't know what your
[10:47] hopeless situation is and I I say that
[10:51] like this in quotations I don't believe
[10:54] it's hopeless
[10:55] but whatever that situation is it's left
[10:58] you feeling powerless gyrus can you
[11:01] imagine a father powerless he felt like
[11:05] there's nothing I can do Jesus was
[11:08] indeed his only hope we have to forget
[11:12] about the voices of doubt we have to
[11:15] forget about the fear that tries to
[11:18] paralyze us and we have to hear the
[11:22] words of truth from Scripture don't be
[11:25] afraid only believe we know then all
[11:29] things are possible maybe you have had a
[11:33] bad report from the doctor
[11:35] maybe your children are backslidden away
[11:39] from God maybe your spouse is not
[11:42] serving the Lord maybe your marriage is
[11:44] breaking apart you feel like there is no
[11:49] way out and no hope I want to tell you
[11:51] today that indeed he is Jesus Christ
[11:56] ha the same yesterday today and forever
[11:59] and he speaks to you from his word today
[12:02] don't be afraid only believe it's never
[12:06] too late to cry out to God I want to
[12:11] encourage you to do that right now
[12:12] cry out to him he still hears an answers
[12:17] prayer he's still able to turn your
[12:20] situation around he loves you so much
[12:24] god bless you only believe
[12:30] you
