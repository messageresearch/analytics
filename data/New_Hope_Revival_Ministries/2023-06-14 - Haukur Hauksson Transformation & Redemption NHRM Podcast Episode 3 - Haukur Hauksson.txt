TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign hey I'm Joshua Shelly and welcome to another nhrm podcast this is the third one that we're doing and I'm really excited about this one I would like to take just a second to thank everybody for the encouraging words y'all are the reason that it's we're keeping it going because I have so many after they come out I have so many texts and phone calls um you know thanking me for and telling me how much they were blessed and we just had some special meetings at our church and the amount of people that came up to meet and asked me you know when is the next one coming out it's it's the next month when is it coming out um it just is super encouraging and I'm I'm so thankful that y'all are enjoying these I enjoy making them and I'm just trying to be a blessing um and today we have a very special guest uh it's the man behind the camera usually Hawk um he moved here and he has done so much for this ministry and this church with the media and uh I am honored to be able to call him one of my friends and I am so thankful for all he has done in this church and especially with this podcast helping me get it started he spends countless hours editing filming and doing all that so I'm super thankful for him and I'm excited to have you on I'm excited to be on all right well I can't wait like you said I'm usually behind the camera it's a little bit different it is different I had to get used to it so um but no it really is an honor to have you on and thank you for thank you for first of all I'd like to thank you for when I brought you this idea for running with it with me it meant a lot um even I have to remember when dad asked well who's going to be doing it and you know you said well Joshua came to me with the idea I think he wants to do it and you had full confidence in me and I really appreciate that and I couldn't have done it without you I would say you're natural well I'm trying I wouldn't try um but I I want to start get your testimony today and just talk about your life how you came here to this ministry um what the Lord is doing in you um but let's just start out back from the beginning where you were born uh and what it was like growing up well it's always encouraging to go over your testimony because it's it's so encouraging to to look back and see what God has done in your life um I'm born and raised in Iceland it's uh it's a tiny little island in the middle of Atlantic between North America and Europe you know geographically we belong to North America and Europe politically we belong to Europe but we're kind of mixture of America and Europe it's interesting uh growing up was interesting I I would say I grew up in a dysfunctional home I'm born 1982 and at that time you know I had a mom and a dad that lived together and I want to be real and but I don't want to dishonor my parents yeah for sure you know but the reality is they struggled both with alcohol and when I'm around four years old to get a divorce but leading up to that uh my dad started doing some questionable stuff and got known on this tiny little island that only at that time was maybe around 300 000 people he was known for uh some stuff that I know he is not proud of and he would be called the like porn king of Iceland like headlines I didn't know it at the time I just knew that I I lived in a chaotic home and uh and so my Mom leaves him and she's just trying to struggle for life you know and she ends up meeting a man that became my stepdad for a long time but I remember moving a lot I went to different schools and and my dad was kind of absent most of my child did he he later like got saved and and God did a work in his life but he always struggled he had always his ups and downs ah I remember you know you know I had a lot of like identity issues my mom was not there for me like emotionally and at that time it's hard especially at such a young age yeah and she she ended up being in and out of rehab and and using you know I remember she using some pills and stuff and so often in the evenings it was kind of numb and so you can really you know connect with her uh I actually asked my brother not long ago like I remember my mom going for extended rehab and uh vaguely I don't have clear memories and I was like where was I when she was gone because my stepdad was often not home yeah he was often just you know working for weeks at a time one good thing about my step that he provided for me uh even though he wasn't like a dad or father to me I did not have a connection with him but he did provide for me and looking back I'm thankful for that uh were you and your brother close grown up we were but he lived with my grandparents okay I don't think I didn't know that uh he so I have I have two brothers and two sisters but my oldest brother he is the only one that is we have both the same that's the one we stayed at right when I went yes okay and I'm very close to him today you know he's funny yeah I actually absolutely love him yeah you know and I love talking to him I love being around him I can't get enough of it and I'm super you know thankful for him uh so growing up I I was always in trouble I was a troubled kid and and because I've you know I felt the absence of my dad and the in my mom being an alcoholic and not being there for me you know I I kind of lived on the street what I mean by that I didn't like being home yeah you know I just didn't like it and and then during school I was the troubled kid you know I was the black sheep every school I went to so I was the friend of the principal not really a friend but I was always there ended up going to the psychiatrist of the school uh then I remember when you know parents of other kids would like not want their kids to be with me you know they that affected me for sure you know I didn't know how troubled that was I have to be honest you know at that time I didn't know uh but I got violent and angry and and then leading up to my I would say early teen I would be scared to death like scared to death I put up a front you know trying to be tough but I was because I was afraid of responsibility I didn't have any good habits I was confused my life was chaotic I didn't like to be at home and you know in my identity was being the black sheep or the trouble kid that was always in trouble and in that kind of formed who I was and then in my teen years like how I faked it put up a front you know I'm almost just be honest I was a tiny little kid inside scared to death so I'll start smoking weed just very young drinking very young you know eight ninth grade I'm doing drinking and smoking uh and then I start to work out I played sport most you know I was hyper all my life like I was always like ADHD my mom tried to get me on medicine but said I always fooled the doctor uh but in my early teens that's where things got really sour so you mix a confused kid it doesn't like his reality with an anchor with drugs alcohol alcohol and then steroids I started using testosterone steroids pretty young and uh and so that was my mechanism to survival like I'm just gonna be big and mean yeah weren't and weren't you at some time at some point like the strongest kid in Iceland in your age group or something like that well oh you there's no way to measure it but I remember just being 14 15 like if I heard somebody was like approaching you know what I was doing in bench press or something like that I would like up that was just that was like your motivation just to like yeah you know I'm gonna just be strong yeah and mean and I was that's that will that's what you were trying to build to be yes but I went for further and further in drugs and so I end up uh like I have 10th grade education the school system is a little bit different in Iceland uh you you are in school until 10th grade and then there's like a in between like 11th and 12th grade technically yeah like here in between where you are like choose a path where you're going and then College I finished 10th grade but I tried to go to another school but I didn't have the ability to do homework to do the classes like I was just I was so what would you say troubled yeah and and I did not like my reality so I went into more and more drugs went to worse and worse like worst crowd yeah and I and I think you told me before too like the drugs over there are super like easy to get and everything so it's always around you is that right or at that time it was yeah and it's even worse now that's yeah much much worse and what happens uh the sad thing that happens when you are in that world is your conscience gets numb and you you get you get used to doing worse and worse stuff yeah and I ended up being pretty violent and so um I'm going deeper and deeper into uh addiction and I remember when when I'm realizing that my life is just starting to be pretty bad it's just a mess it's just a mess and and it was like it was living a nightmare yeah because everything that you did was illegal and I never like went to prison unless it was like overnight and it was usually for violence like for you know iodine or something yeah and I went to court a few times for literally bringing this was all still at a pretty young age wasn't it yeah like 17 yeah 18. and I remember the only plants that I had was like illegal my like my vision for life was to make money illegally yeah you know it's crazy that was just the kind of crowd that you were in right yeah and I didn't know anything else yeah and I I remember you know being in in Denmark you know and I and I Was preparing huge shipments of drugs over to Iceland yeah and and I would get lost for weeks at a time just somewhere in Europe you know and I would come back home to Iceland and it was I was completely wasted completely wasted and emotionally and physically at that time I was just in such a bad shape because I wasn't the best criminal I couldn't handle it yeah you know I was just used to stuff we forgot money you know I spent the money you know so it was just it created chaos even more um we're used to like really angry like an angry person that around this time still yes because I remember you telling me you're not trying to backtrack but I remember you telling me a story uh a long time ago about you were a little kid I think and you were at maybe a cousin's birthday party or something like that and you got like real mad at something and you ended up walking like miles home you were like 10 or something like that I think is what you told me yeah it was actually at a Christmas party okay and uh I got Furious and he's like walked like how many I mean it was a long ways if I remember correct probably uh 15 miles and you were I mean you were little yeah it was just so much anger built up yes that's crazy which is and before you people that's so crazy to me because like I could never see like that type of person like you tell me these stories and stuff and I've heard your testimony before and it blows my mind because like you were the nicest person I know so what happens is like I was just so broken emotionally yeah and physically I was the anxiety that I felt was crazy and fear fear of the future fear of was like uh you know it was torment and and I and this is probably where I'm like 19 20 years old things just get worse and worse I get in more and more trouble like I get things around them and just get darker and darker and emotion like in my internally I you know I get in really really bad shape and and really no hope out of it and I there was and at that time I remember saying to myself I remember it that like I'm so wasted and far gone that I'm never gonna I have a wife because I'm I'm in sort of bad shape I'll never be able to have children because you know I'm I'm so far gone emotionally and all my future plans at that time and I'm thinking this like have to do with illegal activities and so I say to myself like this is it you know that you know that's that's my fate that's my destiny to be a criminal and it was surreal it really was um but it was after that that God sovereignly starts to visit me I was renting a place with a friend and I would say I had lived in a few different places you know I I left fairly Young from from home and and I remember living with a friend and I actually I loved my friend and I actually care about him today we totally split ways and uh and I always think about him I've dreamed about him a lot and I prayed for him uh he was a really really nice guy but while I was in that state that I just described to you I would the only like this is the only way how I can explain this this is just how it is I don't have all that you know complete understanding of how the Lord did this but I know the spirit of God visited me at that State I would I would hit the pillow as soon as I hit the pillow I shot out of my body and I would be free completely free I would fly all around this Earth and I would go to different places each night and sometimes I was just you know it's crazy to talk about but I would fly over the oceans of the Earth different oceans uh Mountain uh different mountains cities and and I remember that one day when like I'm I'm awake and I'm hyper sensitive to the realm of the spirit I wasn't seeing in the spirit but I was like there was something in me like a knowing that was like I know there's more to this that I can see like awareness yeah and uh before before like all that started happening had you ever had like have you ever been to church or anything about God or um my exposure to church remember when I told you that my my dad had had like an encounter with God so maybe when I'm like seven or eight years old I don't remember exactly all of that is kind of blurry to me my you know my dad is in a questionable business and everybody knows about it in Iceland and but he gets saved and a week later he goes to Sweden for a Bible School and I remember that I went to visit him when I'm like seven or eight years old it to Sweden uh and I I think I I went I know I went to church I don't remember it yeah but I went to church a few times there okay I didn't realize what was going on with your dad at that time but I have like faint memories of that time my dad you know didn't have the ability to like walk out what God was doing to him I actually believe he had a great calling of God on his life because he's a he's a very convincing person he said he's a likable guy yeah he you know and and but he ends up moving to Talent he goes from Sweden he actually uh my brother was conceived in Sweden you know and I never knew my brother until he was a teenager their brothers really I didn't realize and his name is Daniel oh and he's a great guy I don't really have a close relationship with him but I see him when he visited Iceland so I would have to say I do have some exposure even though I didn't grow up in a Christian home yeah Christian values like the opposite but it wasn't nothing like you were experiencing when like like when you started having the supernatural yeah because I would say I would not like growing up I didn't really have a a Biblical world view yeah there was something in me that kind of believed there was a god even though I didn't really confess it um but at when this is happening with me when I'm like awakened to the realm of the spirit I had no idea what was going on the total honest yeah but and then I'm not sure exactly for how long this was happening this happened maybe maybe a month it could have been two months but I really yeah but after a series of dreams you know where I'm like I'm telling you I could not wait to go to bed just the experience that again feel free it was freedom total freedom and uh because I used to go and use drugs to to escape my reality yeah now I went to bed and got free wow uh the terminology that I would use now after Walking with God you know the Holy Spirit was brewing over me you know preparing me to receive him and how old would you you said you're like 18 19. there I'm probably 20 actually so still pretty young though yeah really about your age about your age [Music] um and and so what happens is I wake up like out of a bad dream after this after this season and I'm like what just happened to me and I'm like five years gone by in just craziness you know escalated but now I'm just like I wake up and it was like I I woke up from a bad dream everything was blurry everything was like I didn't I didn't remember what just happened yeah several years just going by like this and I'm like what just happened and and I say goodbye to everybody that I was fellowshipping with really you're live at that time is your friends yeah and I actually was in different groups you know somewhere like hardcore criminals some not that bad but life to me was just my friends and partying and stuff like that and by the grace of God I walk away completely shut off all communication to everybody and that I mean that would be hard to do yeah but there were I'm telling you it was the grace of God for sure like there is no explanation why why did I do yeah because I mean that's you know quote-unquote that's what you lived for is you know that's what you were doing like that that was like you said that was your life and so I stopped drugs alcohol everything totally delivered from that uh and a move into my grandparents and and at that time you know I'm still not a Believer but I'm like super interested and I would say consumed about what is going on around me like like what in the world is happening in the other Realm it's only like yeah and and so I start to look a little I would say a little bit into the new age not deep but that was intriguing and because I was I was trying to find truth if I'm just being honest I remember at that time this is before I'm saved I remember uh after this happened to me this Awakening all my passwords at that time had the word truth in it well because I was like I need to find the truth and it's interesting that I used yeah and it kind of just a random word I mean and what was so amazing is that my grandmother always believed in me you know I don't know why yeah and uh and I actually I loved her deeply and she never gave up on me and she provided me a home and that was kind of safe place and and I have to say that I don't know like how long it took for me but I remember my dad is more in Iceland at that time and had been for a while and I'm getting like more and more connected to my dad um but again I remember one time shortly before I get saved but still after this Awakening yeah my dad said the wrong thing and I absolutely flipped and I remember again I think I walked again like 10 50 miles just to get off all the anger off oh I had forgotten about it but until now uh because in my mind like I I felt like he betrayed me you know he wasn't there for me he wasn't there too like do daddy stuff yeah uh but like I love him today I love talking to him today well I think I only met him that one time but like when I met him he's a super nice guy super likable um net now do you think that has helped you become a better father to your kids because you didn't want that absence in their life like you wanted to be there for them no matter what yeah but it's taking time yeah I don't feel like I was the best dad in the beginning for like I have three children yeah and uh but at at this point in time 100 like 100 uh I was like I remember this is so interesting I remember when I was growing up I was like I don't want to be like my parents I was determined not to be like my parents but I ended up being like my parents really it's interesting how it works yeah because that's the only thing you can see like you you get molted into the image of your surroundings and so in my mind I'm like no I'm I'm not going to be like that and I ended up being like that you know and so the environment that you uh create for your children is so important sure because they've become what they see and and it I just remember like I'm I'm not going to be like them I'm not and then and but as I'm being acquainted more and more with my dad uh I remember that I was in a like an office space and it was connected to uh Christian television network which we'll talk more about in a minute sure uh connected to a Christian television network in Iceland and so my dad he had an old friend and I actually had a few memories of my Dad's friend his name is Eric Erickson and I had a few memories off of him of him or Eric but now my dad is doing some kind of a business with Eric Erickson and I'm coming to this office to see my dad and and there's a brother his name is brother goodminder he is working with Ericsson at the station and I think this was on the third floor and I'm just sitting there and my my dad is there and I remember a friend of my dad and I didn't know him a friend of my dad is there and brother Goodman there he he's a pastor in Iceland for the good mother is there it hadn't I didn't know brother Goodman then yeah uh and I'm just overhearing so I'm like in this awakened State spiritually you know seeking truth and I over here but the good mender explaining baptism water baptism to for my Dad's friend and for some reason I I have no idea why something perked in me thank you attention yeah I'm not a believer I'm you know I really don't know anything about the Bible and and are just there was something in me and I turned around to goodmander brother goodminder and I was like hey cannot get baptized and he was like what he was shocked like but he got kind of excited it's like yeah come come to a Bible study next Wednesday and uh and after the Bible study we will get baptized that's awesome and so he was going to baptize this man and I remember I go to uh I go to the Bible study and there's maybe 15 20 people it wasn't big but they were all significantly older than me and it's it was and so it's fun a little bit funny to think about it like I'm sitting there I'm 20. maybe 21. I can't remember exactly you know your age and all these people way older than me I'm in a Bible study and I'm like I was like what are you doing there yeah that's exactly how I felt and I could I I'd be honest too like I had no idea what he was talking about yeah no idea but I was I feel like I was being sovereignly led I was there for a reason and I knew it interesting and so I go after this uh the Bible study to another church and it's like a Pentecostal church that was lending us the baptistry their baptistry and I get baptized and uh and that that at that point I didn't know that he was baptizing me in the name of the Lord Jesus but you know what's funny later on I go to him like how was I baptized because later on I started the message and I wanted to make sure that he baptized me the right way anyway so I get baptized and I'm driving away from my from from the baptism and then I call pretty much the only friend that I had at that time we were on a similar Journey uh we were just trying to figure out life and he was an old school mate he wasn't with me in like in the drugs like I got I I got acquainted with him again after years of of not being around him and uh and I remember I called my friend I was like hey you don't you can't believe what I just did I just got baptized and I feel amazing and he's like you've lost it like I have no idea what you're talking about uh and that started me on a journey so slowly I started being uh around my dad more and around that television network and I can't tell you like one specific time like oh this is where I got born again this is where like I accepted God because when I went to the channel the station I was in my mind like I was full of life and full of energy and positivity and not saved and I go in but I loved going to the channel I loved going talking to the people and I was feeling sorry for them because I feel like I have this Awakening Spiritual Awakening in this you know there's a realm around me that is like infinite yeah and but they put everything in this one little book and in my mind's like man you're missing out literally and I told them and they knew my my stand ah but the more I was around them I knew they had something that was real and Eric Erickson he had like joy and peace about him that really affected me like impacted me and and then I was introduced more and more to the gospel and what was interesting at that time my mind was like God became a man the Creator like like I I couldn't I couldn't grasp it but my heart could not get away I'm telling you it was like I was drawn I was drawn to it and I couldn't escape it like I could not accept it but it took time and I remember when I finally surrender and this Revelation hit me is like there is a God and he is the Lord Jesus Christ and I I just surrendered I was like I was blown away uh you know I was forever changed because all the confusion all the problems that I have had finally I had identity like you know because I had been so confused and so scared and now the truth that I was seeking was open to me you know and I saw that it was my heavenly father that was doing all this stuff in my life yeah and I was like looking back now I see he was doing it uh and at one time I I just felt I wanted to be involved in what they were doing on the channel I wanted to help I started go to services and uh and because we know this ministry built on uh the Revelation that was given to brother Brown up so at that time I did not know there was like a messenger to the leadership like no great and I had no great that the owner of the television station believed that there was a message for the bride and uh but I was absolutely in love with God absolutely in love just with Jesus and I was so thankful and I remember one time that I am walking there's like a little hallway and there was all it was full both of tapes videotapes and there were some books and I remember I was arrested I'm walking I'm arrested and I feel like and I take I take like a I would call it a booklet it didn't look like a book okay because it was like printed on uh this size paper you know like from a printer yeah that you have in your office it wasn't like a real book it was like a booklet and and I take it and uh and I take it home and it was the life story of Bertha Bradham really yeah but still I had no idea that they knew about what out of all the books that were standing yes and I remember I actually take it home living with my grandparents at that time and I'm in my living room and I sit down and I start to read and it was the most unattractive book in the show I'm not kidding I'm not making that up that is the truth and I started reading the book and I actually cried for the first time since I was a teenager I just bald and bald and bought and I was like I knew somehow I was I was another was continuation of my story yeah and I was blown away with this and I remember I take the booklet and I go to uh brother Goodman or that I just told you about in Erickson's like do you know what this is and they were blown away they were absolutely blown away because they had kind of been in hiding because they had gone through so much persecution of believing what we call the message and because there's been like you know a lot of extreme uh feticism and confusion around it and uh and there's a lot of stigma in Iceland about uh brother Brenna and they had actually encountered a lot of uh opposition persecution from different denominations and pastors because because of it so they were not openly uh talking much about yeah the message at that time so I had no idea I had no idea that they were following a certain truth and but I was blown away and they were blown away that I was excited because it was like a breath of fresh air to them that you have a 20 year old a 21 year old you know somebody interesting in that and and that kind of let me on a journey of like started reading and listening to brother Branham so uh at that time I started to just work full time and I would with the with the Channel TV station yes and I remember like one of my favorite times was when brother Erickson would invite me to his home and just tell of the amazing stories that God had done in his life that was like I loved it yeah I kind of was fed by his faith and his you know sometimes when you're you know in your early stages of your walk with God yeah so you get you you get strength from other people's walk with God for sure as you're getting more stable and uh and one thing that is kind of interesting that I want to share is when I'm I think I'm 14 years old and I remember because of a little bit of my conflict with my dad he gives me a Bible or Christmas and at that time I did not appreciate it I actually was offended that he gave me a Bible you have this man that is not very involved in my life and he randomly just gave me a Bible and I I pack it away no idea what what I did with it but I remember that I after I get saved I remember that I had a Bible we are talking about seven years later years later and I moved from my home and so I have no idea and now I'm living with my grandparents and my and because of what was going on in my life my brother it affected my brother so much that he started to go into meetings he had I would say some experience with God before I think but now when I was you know all on fire for God and he saw what happened in my life you can ask my brother yeah you know he saw like the the total 180 in my life then then I remember I had a Bible so my brother's visiting my grandmother and here he wrote saying hey I need to find a Bible because he got that same Christmas got a Bible too from my dad and he goes so my grandmother lives on the sixth floor and it's in the basement they had like a storage unit and my my brothers like I wonder if my Bible is in that storage unit and he's like oh my Bible could be there too you know could you look for me and he's like yeah I'll look he goes down takes the elevator down comes back and I remember he's like no I do not find your Bible and I got disappointed but there was something that rose up with me no it is it is there your Bible is in there and at the same time Eric Erickson had give given me a big box we were talking like close to 100 cassette tapes of preaching brother Brown but I had no way of listening to it I didn't have a cassette player and and so I have this box in that apartment my Grandma's apartment it's not right there in where I slept so what I do I I go right right then when my brother said he couldn't find my Bible I tell him like Hey I'm gonna I feel like it's there I go down take that elevator down and then I open up the storage unit there's a little box right chest height first box that I see like I literally open and I'll open it up there's my Bible and a cassette player wow side by side and then I was like how annoying it was like a sovereign moment in my life that God had everything under control I used to have the Bible yes uh I use it every day and uh my wife for my birthday on time had it found in leather oh so is it the one that you that you carry around there yes I didn't realize that was the first one wow yeah it's very special to me yeah like I'm very sentimental to that Bible like extremely I understand uh and so I'm just an awe at that time of the sovereignty of God I'm just I feel like I'm in the middle of his perfect will everything is just amazing and and so now I'm gonna kind of start into how I got acquainted with your dad to this ministry yeah because at that time I'm working at the station and a lot of things is happening very fast in my life a lot of changes and I remember and what's amazing my grandmother sees what's going on in my life and see start to come with me to Bible studies yeah and to services and I remember she would serve and clean and cook you know help there and and and I remember also my my grandpa who I actually did not like previously after I got saved we became best friend because he dealt with uh he was an alcoholic and and I remember my Grandma coming with me to Bible stories and my grandpa calling station cursing screaming like freaking out you know absolutely freaking out but you know what happens he ended up coming to bible studies and washing dishes wow yeah like it's incredible dude that's crazy and uh like I said I'm telling you that was a miracle yeah absolute miracle and uh and I'm I like looking back one of the one of the things that I'm most thankful for is that my grandma I know she got saved you know I 100 believe that and uh because I loved her so much and because he she never like gave me up hoping me the only one pretty much like that meant so much to me yeah um and so when I'm at the channel in an in that is something that marked me too was media for the kingdom of God and that set me on a path where I'm I'm still on today doing media for the kingdom of God and uh and I would start to film various programs different pastors different talk shows for Eric Sanders for Omega that the channel and there at that time there was actually a lot of things going on with the channel they were the first 24 7 station for Scandinavia they were in the Middle East they were the third most popular channel in the UK for a period of time like it was a it was unbelievable yeah um but for Iceland for Omega I would film a brother named Olaf Johansson and I just referred to him as brother Olaf and from the Bible and I can tell you before I got saved I would I had an attitude towards Jewish people in Israel uh but but I was that was a very isn't that a very common thing in Iceland for a lot of Icelandic people very common yeah and I would say that is the the the attitude of the nation yeah you know very sad the newspapers are pretty biased and and also just the news and I can you can also for most part sense it on the people yeah and without knowing it I was influenced by it but you started filming the programs with brother Olaf they were called Israel today he from the scripture taught me to love the nation of Israel and love the Jewish people and and I became a good friend with brother Olaf you know and I'll remember he he would go one or two times a year times a year to Israel for extended time from one he comes back from one of the trips and he is saying like oh I need to I need to tell you about this brother who is from Alabama but is traveling back and forth from Alabama to Israel several times a year and you would be very interested in because he believes similar things as you and he loves Israel and that just perked my interest and so I go on the website revival.org how old were you around this time still maybe 22. okay so still really young yeah this is happening very fast yeah uh yeah I think 22 to 23. yeah I mean this is not like years have gone by this is like months they are happening very fast and I remember that I'm a go to revival.org and I read some of the experiences that Pastor Shelley your dad had and one of them was an angel talking to him about instructing people how to walk in the spirit and how to be be prepared for the end times and for the last harvest in Heavenly places and because of like my interest in the Supernatural and what what how I was led to God I was so excited I can tell you and something in me was like oh that's a part of your destiny I just there was a knowing and there's there's a brother he brother siki who I got acquainted with during that time I knew him from uh back in the days from being in drugs and stuff but I got to know him after I got saved I went to some meetings Christian meetings and he was there and we got acquainted again God was doing something amazing things in his life and I remember contacting Ziggy and it's like hey check this out you know this is like on an epic uh scale but you know because he he got interested in in brother Branham too you know I gave him the Supernatural series and uh and God was just doing amazing stuff in both of our lives at that time and so I I got super excited about you know going Before the Throne of God being taught by him prepared by him face to face encountered like I was like sign me up like I'm ready uh then I go to Eric Erickson and I'm like you have to invite this brother here and you have to contact him and and I don't remember how often I asked like still a little bit foggy like all the details everything I'm telling you is like I don't remember like great details it's like an overview you know when I'm trying to put all these things together sure then uh I know that he calls your office the New Hope office and actually my wife today she picked up the phone and she was I don't know if I ever knew that or if I did I forgot it and she was actually in the meetings in Jerusalem when brother Ola was there and so she hears brother Olaf talk about Iceland and Eric Erickson and and there was something in her that kinda picked her heart perked her heart I wonder why yeah um but so she knew who he was when he was he was called yeah and and I remember you know your dad talking about it like he she transferred the phone calls and I don't think your dad liked to take every phone call but she knew he was interested in the phone call so he picks up the phone and the thing he said like what took you so long to call and I think because Perry green had talked about Eric Erickson yeah I think maybe a decade earlier I don't know uh and so he knew about Eric Erickson from that time and so now Eric Erickson is calling but it's crazy to think about it took you a 22 year old you know young man yeah to get the ball rolling yes I mean it's crazy that it really is crazy thing but because with I mean sure it made it would have happened later on down the road but without you pushing and pushing this studio wouldn't be here today yeah it it's sovereignty yeah you you can't explain it other way I mean I mean like like I said a 20 20 22 23 straight out of drugs out of alcohol you know like you said your life is a mess you find the Lord you come you know and all this yeah and now here we are sitting today yeah in the studio doing an interview talk about your life but like I said without it you know Dad may not have ever been connected with that with both Erickson or the studio there and then none of this would have been possible yeah I mean you're right like it's it's it's crazy to think about it's hard to wrap your your you know for me it's hard to wrap my my brain around it like uh I know I was super excited about your dad coming to Iceland and I remember I had a dream just before he came that he stepped out of an airplane with like a silver plate full of stakes uncooked like raw like almost like you see in a cartoon in perfect shape you know the fat around it juicy red steaks like you had a platter on them and uh and he comes to Iceland with one of the brothers from here and and I was I was pumped like I was so excited you know because I connected with the promises even though I hadn't been here just uh I connected with the promises that were for this place then uh what I liked about what you you would your dad brought was the freedom in the spirit like I love the brothers there like I love brother the Goodman but there was like there was an anointing that your dad carried that it was life-changing to me like it like it opened up something for me and because even though I'm like sold out to God literally you knew there was something more yeah like I had like I didn't do anything wrong at that time like I was just I was trying to sanctify myself like reading the word listening to preaching praying like this that was much yeah like walking with God I was like I was sold out you know and but your your dad brought something like it the more of the the spiritual uh side of of the equation at that at that time yeah and he came actually a few times and again I don't remember your dad actually came a lot of times to Iceland he's been there A lot of times and he did that in the beginning quite often he would he would come and film a lot of programs and there would be uh subtitled to Icelandic and they were also aired on you know in Europe then I end up coming here do you remember when like what year that was I think that was the first time I came with 2004 in 2005. so 2004 I would have been 22. really yeah if I think about it because I think it was like a I think it was a New Year's meeting when I came the first time okay say I would have been three well okay yeah that's crazy yeah it's crazy to think about yes uh yeah I'm I'm on I didn't realize you ever came here when you were that young yep I don't know why I thought I didn't remember I'm like I'm 90 sure yeah that's the meeting but still you came here when you're pretty young I mean I I guess I didn't realize that uh then I do remember your your dad came I said okay I'm trying to remember it could have been the year year after that but I'm not sure but in in one of the the meetings that I that I came I remember that your dad prophesied over my life and so do you know God has done a lot of things in your life you know you've experienced a lot he's you know met you and yeah changed you Etc but he wants to feel you he wants to do more he wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost previously I wasn't sure if I had the holy ghost or not because of the Deliverance I had because of Revelation I feel like I was receiving you know I was like I I probably have the Holy Ghost right like there's been so much in my life I must have the Holy Ghost but I wasn't sure and I I didn't have that like knowing that we made that are talking about exactly I did not have that and I can tell you that you know I hadn't talked to your dad about that yeah at all but he prophesied in a New Year's meeting like hey God wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost uh and I remember account for another summer camp meeting and uh and during that summer camp meeting I kind of things started with me in Mary Beth who is my wife now and it's actually a funny story how uh your dad found out about that she was interested in me okay go ahead um so in one of the meetings that I'm here like like camp meeting uh she was she was working with some of the videos and you know I'd worked at the church for a while uh she had taken a screenshot of one of the videos and put it as a screensaver on her laptop and then and then your dad wanted a meeting I know I'm not sure what the meeting was about and so she brings the laptop to his meeting had totally forgot that my face was on the screensaver she opens up don't you ever do that and see she got pretty embarrassed that's funny and I think you're that and I think your dad was uh shocked I'm sure and like you know I think maybe his response like do you realize you know his past you know what what kind of guy he was so do you remember that the first time you came I do do you yeah and I had just to be told uh just to be honest I think your dad shared about her and others before I'm ever matter in something in me yeah like but I don't know how to explain it there was something in me that just had I I got curious and yeah I mean and she had been here like I said working for the church or whatever and she had traveled around the world with Dad and Mom and our family for a long time like with see what's in in Jerusalem yeah see my brother Laurel when your dad met brother Olaf Okay so we could we get start talking a little bit we may have started talking before that again it's still the details yeah but uh and in one of the trips to Iceland your dad talks about he is going to Israel the fall uh one in the fall of that year that is 2006. I know that for sure um so he and he extends like an invitation like you guys can come to to Jerusalem and spend some time with us um and I was like oh man absolutely 100 uh I got really excited and there were brother Shiki came with us uh brother Magnuson and brother Ayo we all went to Israel together and met with your dad and another brother uh from this ministry and I was pretty excited and one one thing I remember I think I got a call or an email and saying like Hey we're gonna be staying at the Sea of Galilee and uh would you want to share a room with pastor and and for the carry and my first response was like no I don't want to bother them like and then I was like wait a minute yeah I want to and like there's something like I I want to and so I'm actually pretty excited so that happens earlier in the year of 2006 then in the summer I come before camp meeting things start happening with me in Mary Beth like we started talking like on a serious note um and then Feast of Tabernacles 2006 I'm in Israel and and it was an amazing trip there there was a lady that kind of was handling things for our ministry sister Nancy at that time and I remember like I would give Faithfully towards that Ministry like the ministry the Jerusalem side of the ministry you know in the beginning I would always every month try to to send money to help her with what was going on there and I go to Israel had three weeks and one thing about sister Nancy she would have a schedule from morning to evening pretty much and we were like go go we were go go go but uh an experience of a lifetime you see so much you know with a person that lives and knows everything about yeah you know being there and at the end of the trip uh we go to CEO Galilee and but this time when we're driving towards the city of Gala we actually stop at the River Jordan and your dad was going to baptize some of us and all on the way to to being baptized in my heart I'm like Lord I'm doing this now knowing what I'm doing because I have been baptized yeah having no idea what was going on and but in this time I'm going to be baptized in uh fully my heart is fully in what I'm doing and I'm meditating on it on the way to the baptism and we get baptized and we go then shortly after that to the Sea of Galilee and I stayed with your dad in his room and I remember thinking how exhausted I was I don't remember if it was the first night or the second night but I'm gonna think this happened in the first night the first night I am just I'm tired after just being going going going and and going to bed it was actually freezing we icelanders don't use ACS and your dad was blasting that day and I was so cold [Music] but then I wake up that morning and uh and I wake up and I'm full of energy literally you had an ice bath though yeah and your dad is going out of the room but brother Carrie we're three staying in the in the room and and I tell brother Kerry I tell him like I feel different like I'm vocalizing this what I'm about to tell you why I believe it is because I'm vocalizing how I feel before I know what really happened so I'm telling like yeah I just feel different I'm I have so much energy I feel so good you know and he kind of acknowledged it like yeah I think I think maybe me too you know and then just two minutes later five minutes later your dad comes just like walking in like it's like oh by the way there were three angels in the room last night and I look at brother carriers like ah and now I was so happy that that I stayed in the room and the angel that came to your dad there were three angels one by her dad one by me and one by Brother Carrie the Angel by your dad had a message for him and but then your dad noticed that the Angels were doing hand motions over our bodies and it was odd to your dad and he's like what what are they doing and he felt an inspiration or the angel talked to him saying like ministering to their needs and again to this day no doubt in my mind because I I felt the change yeah this was at like last part of our trip to Israel maybe two three days later I'm back in Iceland again don't remember exactly yeah but at that time I'm actually renting a bedroom in uh in brother Olaf's apartment so I moved out from my grandparents and renting a bedroom at brother Olaf's apartment and brother Ola was actually in Israel at that time so I go back home and I'm by myself in the apartment then I'll go to sleep and I wake up not realizing what was going on but I was like man I am full of energy not connecting the dots I'm full of energy what should I do and I used to work out I mean I still do a little bit but back then I would work out it's like man I have to go to the gym get rid of this energy how often do you wake up like yeah that's not common no I was young but still so I I take my stuff I throw some pants and t-shirt at my gym bag and and then I think I pick it up and I'm walking out of the room there was something like they hit my belly like where are your priorities and so to soothe my conscience you know I'm gonna like oh I'm gonna read a chapter of the Bible and then you go to the gym then I'll go to the gym so I started reading but then I started talking to the Lord and then I started praying and then the spirit of prayer just comes on me and then I just I go on my knees and after I'm praying then I started just worshiping God just God you're holy you're awesome and like boom I'm not exaggerating like an explosion my my belly started pulsating I started vibrating I started crying I started wailing and I started wailing in tongues and and I could feel just a river coming out of me and it got so loud and the voice that the tone of my voice I'd never heard it before it was different and in my mind what was interesting when that happened is like I was worshiping it wasn't just like it was unvoluntarily yeah but I was just yielding to what was happening but at the same time uh like what I believe now I believe There Was An Angel by my bed that night helping me to receive the Holy Ghost because I was so dry I mean I like icelanders are the European they're so dry you know they have a hard time opening up for the realm of the spirit but I know I have just a feeling the same angel that was in Jerusalem was there like help this poor kid he needs it and I think he was preparing my spirit and uh I know like in my mind's eye I can see that what happened I can feel my that was your knowing that was like it was so powerful yeah and in my mind I'm like can I stop this this is what I've been waiting for and I remember man I'm going to have a miracle ministry like this is what's happening this is so powerful like uh like my life is going to be changed forever uh and in my mind like I was like can I stop this how long will this take all the neighbors are going to hear me all of this is going through my mind while I'm just wailing like in in tongues and I can tell you because I had heard some negative stuff from some of the sermons of brother Branham not that he didn't believe in it in in praying in the spirit speaking in tongues it was just you saw some people doing it not living the life yeah oh Christ you know and so that's what he was against and so me being an immature believer like when you hear something negative like I got a little bit critical of it yeah but you couldn't tell me right now there's no way like that was so super nice I wasn't trying to come up with words like I was literally being baptized in the Holy Ghost and I can that changed my life for two reasons for multiple reasons but two main reasons it gave me I would say Like a Prayer life and I would actually say it would Mark me as a I would I would say an intercessor and number two it helped me to be more open worshiping in the spirit raising my hands being a little bit more free yeah not that I could of course I could be more free but that really changed how worship God so then I I felt after that I was so happy I'm telling you I was so happy because in the meeting where I had had the prophetic word like God wants to fill you with the Holy Spirit you you can see that I didn't just listen to that I was like oh I hope that happens yeah no I was playing yeah I wanted it I've been praying for it I've been asking you know multiple times so I that was um a major milestone in my life right after that Israel trip but at the same time I am gearing up in my mind and in my heart to move to Alabama so you had already kind of made up your mind that I don't remember at what point I did it but I had started talking to your dad about it uh and talking to Mary Beth about it because there was a little bit of a conflict because I was so excited about just the promises of God there was for this place because I really wanna have free access to the spirit to the throne of God and be prepared for the final Harvest I have to just be honest like that was like that's what I want uh I want to be used in that capacity uh but at the same time I loved brother Eric Erickson and I love what was going on there so I was and they had bought a really nice property like in the countryside a huge School nice land three houses and even being offered a house there you know so I was I was struggling a little bit just saying goodbye for sure because they had marked my life you know and not only I mean not only all that you're that's where your family is I mean even though you know growing up it wasn't the best situation still your family yeah again I wasn't that close to them you know and so I I have to say that wasn't my struggle at the time no um but I just it's a pool that you can't get away from you know then I come for another New Year's meeting I come here and I kind of have made up my mind that I want to go and and I remember that there was a sister that was visiting this place originally from South America not sure exactly what country but she lived in Florida Caesar Adelaide uh spoke broken English I would say very prophetic and funny always smiling laughing she was it was actually pretty amazing do you remember her I was trying I don't think I mean I know the name but I don't think I remember her oh that's I was just thinking about I don't anyway so see she calls somebody to try to get a hold of me it's like I have to see brother Hawk and uh then I'm going somewhere I think with Mary Beth and she comes she asked me to go meet with her so I'll make it on point to go see sister Adeline and see see started talking to me it's like I wasn't thinking about you I wasn't praying for you I was praying for my family I think her son but then all of but then you stood in front of me while I was praying and I could just see you and the Lord just spoke to me that I'm gonna transfer you from the army of the Lord in Iceland to the army of the Lord in Alabama and and that gave me a tremendous piece and I remember her coming to that was like it's very good that you're identified in the army of the Lord yeah she thought that was neat and I actually really appreciated it yeah because it's a big move going from one country to yeah to another country you know you're not just doing really different states and a culture shock yeah but at the same time I'm excited yeah it was literally Living in a Dream the whole process was like living in a dream and so that started my journey of being here as I move here in March of 2007. when did you get married June 2007. awesome yeah that is and now you have three kids and now I have three kids and I want to say I want to say this well because I know here I'm sure he'll watch it the way you were talking about how um like growing like you you were turning into your dad because if you know that's how you had watched yeah and it made me think about Joseph because he has watched you you know I mean honestly give your life to this ministry in in a way I don't want that to sound bad but you know exactly what I mean um and you see him stepping up now I mean whatever whatever you ask him to do or whatever he needs to do he's there if it's running the front camera if it's running the the back stuff now and now it's playing the drums like Joseph I I joke around with him all the time calling him what Joseph you're a beast and but I'm I'm being serious I mean the way he has stepped up you know is is unbelievable and that is because of you and the influence and the the um uh his his mom is a big part of that too yes but like with the media part and stuff like he saw you do this for years and of course Mary Beth is Mary Beth has been and her family has been in this ministry for years and and he's definitely all three of us are surrounded by great parents but I just said Joseph because Joseph here lately I've noticed his stepped up and it's it's I don't know what we do without him at this point he's actually like that at home too really yeah he's very thoughtful um helps a lot I've always said if someone's gonna be a millionaire in our church oh judge is going to be that person if he is he actually has some big plans but you know the Lord has blessed you with three beautiful kids now and uh I I mean I've I if so one of the interesting this is an interesting story quick yeah um my there's a there was there was actually a prophecy after one of the transvisions uh that your dad had talking about Esther and that the bride was like Aster that she would you know come before the Throne of God In Praise uh and there was that prophecy that actually quickened me of naming my youngest girl Esther Esther but I actually uh fought it disaster is not really a Hebrew name and there's some negativity around it but I couldn't get away from it yeah uh and so I pray and I pray and I pray and then I finally I settle like but her name is supposed to be asked her and sure enough she was born at Purim that celebrates the victory yeah that Esther was absolutely how old is she she's she just turned four she says turned four now yeah that's crazy to think about yeah [Music] um but I mean like I said you you you and Mary Beth both but since you know you're on the podcast I'm talking about you you have been such a help in this ministry I mean I know Dad would agree with me he couldn't thank you enough for all that you've done and and not only helping this Minister you've been a true friend and not only me but to our whole family I mean I've talked to you about stuff that I've been going through I mean I've talked to you more about some stuff than I have my own parents because I know I can I can come to you I can trust you and you're going to give me not only an honest answer as a friend but also a spiritual answer and help me and guide me and I couldn't thank you enough for that Hawk I mean you you're truly a I mean it's just a pleasure I mean and we've also had the opportunity now to travel the world together so we've been you came to Israel with us when our whole family went and I've got to go back to your home country Iceland and hopefully to do it again soon yes um I I want to touch on one other thing yes I want to talk about you just got back from Mexico not long ago right and okay I want to touch on two things but we'll talk about this for a second and you had a pretty pretty cool story about a young boy there and you shared it in church and if you wouldn't mind I'd like you to share it on the podcast if that's okay yeah so I have a a pastor friend and Iceland and uh he had been talking to me about Mexico just an amazing for a while hadn't he yeah for a year and he he kept asking me like hey do you want to meet me in Mexico and like it's a great experience and and I kept just putting it off I did not that I didn't want to go but just go to Mexico just to go to Mexico you know I didn't know uh so what I did is like I I really prayed about it and I felt like I heard God say like yeah you should go and and I actually love this brother he's a great man great guy and so I go and meet him in Mexico it was a convention with quite a bit of people and it was split into like kids youth and adults okay and my friend his name is Magnus he uh he always preached the youth he's done it now for two three years and so I would go to the meetings that he would go with the youth and it was actually extraordinary meetings people were so hungry for God for the presence of God to encounter God um but what we walk into the first meeting and and during the first meeting all the speakers are being like introduced but I'm dragged to the states too and then my my friend actually did like the the overseer of the meetings like hey Magnus why don't you come and introduce your friend let him comment and then my my friend is like oh give a short testimony put on the spot and there's several hundred kids and most people that know me I actually do not like speaking in front of Gods like it's one of my things uh I actually really dislike it I can't help it you know I'm trying to overcome it but you know yeah that's just the fact and so I was like I'm put on the spot but I I gave a short testimony there and after that meeting there's a young man I think maybe it's the following meeting there's a young man that approaches me it's like but he doesn't speak English and he's trying to give my attention like I have to talk to you I have to talk to you and then he finally finds an interpreter and and I'm able to speak to him it's like hey uh I how did how did you get away from drugs like it's all around me you know it's Mexico yeah and it's like it's all around me like how can I I need help and how did you do it and for for me it was was Supernatural like there was no method too yeah but uh but on I felt like I I could help him so I just started speaking into his life I said you know I actually started asking questions trying to figure out where he was but then I just started talking to him like the place that you're trying to fill with drugs you you need to allow God to feel it and because he wants to and and I feel like and then I started asking him like do you feel like betrayed like do you feel rejected and then you start answering me it was like you have to forgive and you you have to believe that God is for you you cannot believe that God is against you yeah and he took all of it in and so and I talked into his life the best that I could [Music] and then I think following day I mean there's lots of things going on in the meeting and maybe 10 feet away I see the boy he doesn't know that I'm there there's several hundred kicks 500 at least I would say yeah and uh so this young boy I see him walking 10 feet away from me and then he just dives into the ground and he is Wailing sobbing just and like I could see him like this on the ground and I knew that he was having an encounter with God like I really matter and I'm so happy I saw it yeah I mean because the thing I'm thinking about that out of all the kids that are there he ended up walking like 10 feet past you yes uh and I thought about that yeah then not that service but I think maybe the next service he tries to find me like he looks me up and he's dragging and interpreted with him and he's like gracias gracias like he did it he filled that place he felt that he's like tears in his eyes uh like he was so happy and for me that just made my trip yeah you know yeah I mean that that just that one experience I feel like made the trip worth it yes absolutely it's because when you come in contact with your father yeah who created you the reason why you're here there's not there's nothing like it you know he is the reason for what we would not be able to talk to each other right now if it wasn't okay you know sure he's the reason for absolutely everything touch on this a little bit and you know get your thoughts behind it I know you you have such a burden still for all the people in Iceland yes um because like I said like you said and like we talked about drugs are so easy to get and stuff like that and for I mean when I when I went and visited it was amazing to see this so to see you know your hometown we would be walking down the street and you could Point somebody on the street and tell me I used to do such and such with that guy yeah that guy you shouldn't mess with don't let you know yeah and it blew my mind but you know just to be able to go over there to see where you grew up and stuff was amazing but you have you know you have such a burden for uh for Iceland and um for for me I wanted I do want to say this I think I I loved it when I went over there but when when uh when Daniel passed away yes which is brother Erickson's son for who I don't know when he was killed I think for me that hit me hard because like it needs something needs to change and something's got it I mean something's got to change and when that guy got I'm not trying to get too deep into this I'm not but like when that guy got away with you know a slap on the wrist that was yeah that that that hurt me so bad because you know I love I mean you were a whole lot closer to Daniel than I was but the couple times I got to meet him hey I love Daniel I loved him to death and he was doing so he was doing so good from what I had heard and for something like that to happen it you know of course it's hard to like that's so unfair God's got a plan though and God may have been saving himself from something way worse down the road and that's what I tried to think about I think you're 100 right about that yeah and like but like I said you have do you have any like I said I know something's got to change over there it does and you have I know God you know God has to do it I understand that but do you have any plans or do you have any desires that you you know you wanna that you're wanting to do over there or any thoughts or what I do [Music] um it happened like many many years ago and I'm not going to go into all the details because it gets a little complicated because I'm trying to figure it out yeah [Music] but it started with you know I would get a burden for Iceland nah and I would just start to pray and pray and pray and uh and now remember one time it's like hey God you have to take this just out of me or show me what to do yeah like I can't take it because it was overwhelming uh and then it was actually at lunch I was working for this church I go home from lunch and I go back I just lock myself in my bedroom go on my knees and say God I can't take it like it's I don't know what to do about it yeah and uh either take this out of my heart or show them what to do literally an hour later I get a phone call from Eric Erickson the the one that we've been talking about and he asked me can you come to Iceland I'm like really yeah I was like can you come in two days I was like no there's no way but I talked to your dad and we made Arrangement and I actually went like three weeks later something like that actually the whole story around that that would take two hours because I had serious dreams and but it's just too much to go into but basically I went on a journey that God was calling me to do something in Iceland yeah and I would say it's still vague but I know it has to do with truth and media for the kingdom of God yeah for sure you know and so I have to just what I would love to see I would love to have like a studio like this in Iceland and get more people involved like my generation you know to step up and speak truth because what's happening in America it's it's happening around the world it's happening you see there's so much confusion people are so confused and it's all people don't know who they are you taught Evolution you just hear it because of a coincidence yeah there's no purpose there's no consequences and people are out of control but people they don't know who they are and they're trying to change their gender they're trying to change who they are they're trying to find identity and everything and that's how I was identity is the main problem that people have it's not just evil they're just people don't know they're made in the image and likings of God they don't know it for sure and so when I knew that God literally was my dad that changed everything yeah you know uh still a lot of stuff going inside of my my soul my heart that has to be dealt with and worked on but that set the path form alive and so if we can speak to that to the younger generation clarify that they're not here because of a mistake for sure and uh and that there is a loving God like that would probably be my simple answer and I know it's I know it has to do with media yeah you know and then in truth and but I'm I'm trying to figure it out because one of the things that I I started to tell my family like my wife I was like Hey God is dealing with me that we should start to go to Iceland and we would should just start going over a period of time over the summer you know just to try to figure things out yeah this has been years in making a lot of prayers for sure and a lot of I would say striving in agony because I don't have the answers I'm trying to figure out the answers and when you don't have the answers very uncomfortable just be honest uh and uh and then I tell my family and I actually gave this testimony on Tuesday I I tell myself my kids my wife like God has given me to 2022 for us to go to um to go to Iceland and I actually the reason why like I had been working here for the ministry like full time for a long time and then with my friend my I would say my best friend and uh amazing amazing guy he's like I'm telling you he's absolutely amazing do you think we should get on the podcast I would I would love that but he is like he he is an inspiration to me and he's been an amazing friend like I can't I can't say enough about it yeah like I will cry like I ever talk about him I'll cry um but we started branching out uh and started our own video production company and in my motive was so I could go to Iceland in the summer and start to go to this path it was uncomfortable it was the unknown I'd have been so attached to what was going here on here every day so it was very emotionally uncomfortable for me to Branch out like that yeah you know you're in your comfort zone things are familiar but you know starting in your own video production business it was exciting but like who knows what's gonna happen long story short uh because of that supernaturally through what I did with that company I was able to go to Iceland last year with my family for several weeks but it wasn't because I had earned enough money so spring 2022 I'm supposed to go to Iceland telling my wife and my kids and I'm starting to feel a little bad because I didn't have it I did not have you know tickets housing cars all that I didn't have it and uh and I remember my wife's like you know we should Benjamin got married last year and and I I had told myself I'll never do a wedding video again uh hold up Hawk you gotta do at least one more uh okay okay and uh and I remember like I had told myself and I knew but because there's a lot that goes into it yes it's not my favorite thing to do yeah but because it was Benjamin like I wanted to do it you know and then I was like struggling like buying tickets to go to Texas and all of that but you know you you your family provided housing for us it should work all out but my wife says like I think if we go to wow that wedding like I feel like God is going to do something for Iceland and so we did we went to we went to the wedding and God supernaturally me telling my family for two years like Hey we're going to Iceland all of us in 2022 we got supernaturally provided for me last year and coming this spring I'm like I feel so strong I'm supposed to go back to Iceland with my family feel it very strong but financially like to make too much to take on and uh I actually I go before God it's like Lord if you want me there this summer and take one family you're gonna have to do it yeah four days later tickets car and apartment everything taken care of that's amazing I mean it really is and so that's just give me like it another confirmation I'm on the path you're doing what you're supposed to be doing yeah for sure that's awesome man I mean I can't wait to see I mean I know you you you have big ideas and stuff so I just hopefully I mean I pray for you and hope it all works out and everything for sure so I'm just speaking it out there like like a nice studio in Iceland to to reach the young people sure yeah because the young people I mean I mean like you said it's everywhere the young people over there they need help they do I mean because a lot I mean a lot of them are like how you were growing up I would say yes so absolutely and it's worse now yeah oh for sure it's way worse it's uh it's sad but you know we know who can take care of it that's for sure yeah um do you have anything else that you'd like to share I thought I mean I think I've covered everything I know you have a scripture that you want to share oh yeah I was going to share it in the beginning because your dad's like like we have to have a scripture so it's like I'll take one well I want you I want you to share it um but do you have anything else before you share it that you want to say or nothing nothing specific let me ask you let me ask you do you have if you had to give just a small phrase or not I say phrase but a couple of sentences I I we when I came to you with this idea I told you I was targeting you know of course all age groups but especially my age group and the younger people if you had you know like I said there's a little couple of things that you would say for the younger people in this than the message and this church what would it be I don't mean to put you on the spot no it's fine so it's okay to know about God and I would say probably a lot of people in the message know a lot about God then they're they're here preaching all the time but you can't know him personally without spending time with him the truth uh my biggest transformation is when I am by myself talking to him and he talking to me because that's when it becomes real to me amen yeah uh I have learned so much from like from your dad I would say like he has been the problem not probably he's the biggest influence of Truth in my life you know but it's not real to me to hear somebody else talk about God and when I hear him talk to me and then I act on what he tells me and then it becomes reality that's when I feel like life makes sense yeah and having a personal encounter with God is the greatest thing that anybody can have for sure um for me it's not I would say it's not easy you have to prioritize God and there is no meaning without him if you think about it yeah like he created us he has a plan for us and then we gonna live our life ignoring him yeah he created us and then he died for our sins so yeah yeah like I mean he's everything yeah and so my encouragement is like really seek him until you find out the path he has for your life for sure because that is the greatest Adventure you can be on and and it's the greatest fulfillment you will ever have in your life when you know that he loves you when you know personally that you're accepted and it's so worth it yeah it is so worth it the scripture I was going to share is I remember I spoke here for the first time and this is the scripture that I felt like as I was supposed to supposed to share when I spoke first time at New Hope okay I waited so it's Psalm 40 verse 1 to 3. I'll wait it patiently for the Lord and he inclined to me and heard My Cry he brought me up out of the pit of Destruction out of the Maori clay and he set my feet upon a rock making my footsteps firm he put a new song in my mouth a song of praise to our God many will see and fear and will trust in the Lord amen that's good and so I can absolutely that's my testimony yeah you know he put me on a on a path that has been firm and I'm so glad yeah that's amazing Hawk I mean it's just sit down I mean I've heard bits and piece of your testimony before you've shared it here in church or to sit down with you and talk to you about everything like this has been a great honor and like I said this this part not only this podcast but you know the studio wouldn't be you know wouldn't be what it is without you and I thank you for that I actually remember in I think maybe 2016. we had talked about it uh me and your dad but I think we were in Iceland in 2016 and we were seriously that like your dad was like yeah we have to do it we're gonna do it and then in 2017 we did it it's amazing to see what God's doing that's for sure and like I said it's just with this itself it's encouraging for when people come up and you know say you know how much they like and so I was super happy that you agreed to come on this side of the camera because you deserve to more than just as much and more more stuff than anybody so thank you again um if you don't mind would you mind praying before we ended it absolutely Lourdes we approach you we do it with a thankful heart we thank you for life and we thank you for this moment yes yes Lord your heart is toward people you created us for yourself you love to redeem and restore that's your nature you are love father I just pray for anyone that is listening to this broadcast watching this broadcast that you would draw them to yourself and open up yourself to them make yourself real to them and set them on the path that you created from the beginning and if there's anybody that is struggling with any kind of addiction or are troubled about their self or their walk with you feel distance from you father I just pray in the name of Jesus that you would reach by your spirit and touch their life even send Angels according to your wisdom to minister to them Reach to them Lord with your presence and Lord set them free there is nothing like seeing you and feeling you because it's when you touch our heart and our minds that everything's okay yes Lord everything is at peace when we know that you are on our side and so I just pray for everybody watching that your perfect plan would unfold for their lives and break through in every area for them in the name of Jesus amen amen I didn't do this on the on the one I do with Dad and I've
