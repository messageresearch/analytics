is being a blessing to you and i could call this a blessing because it's a blessing to me to be able to speak to you week to week about the good news and the gospel and the end time message of the lord jesus christ we're studying the birth pains we're talking about jesus's discourse the discourse that our messiah gave on the mount of olives in matthew chapter 24. it's also found the same sermon with a slight variation is also found in the book of luke and there are some other places where particular parts of this sermon are given in the gospels we were speaking last week particularly about matthew chapter 24 and verse 8 where it says all these are the beginning of sorrows it begins to talk about wars and rumors of wars uh see that you be not troubled for for the end is not yet and then it says in verse seven nation shall rise against nation kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places but verse 8 then follows by saying all these are the beginning of sorrows that's king james i read last week from some of the other translations like the new american standard that says but all these things are merely the beginning of the birth pains i think it's clear that we are now transitioning out of the beginning of sorrows the beginning of birth pains and we are seeing uh the the birthing process the labor process the contractions we can see them intensifying this is an analogy that's used in this verse of scripture comparing the unfolding events of the end time just prior to the second coming of the lord jesus christ with a woman who is in travail and in labor and we know that when labor begins it begins small the pains are are bearable and there is quite a gap in between those pains the body is beginning to transition into the labor process and the body is beginning to squeeze so that that little baby can be delivered from the inside of his mommy's warm uh belly to this big old world that's anxiously awaiting his or her arrival and as labor continues to transition and progress in fact i believe that's one of the terms in labor that's used medically is transition labor it's just moving into that place where the contractions are getting more serious not yet a time for the mommy to start helping push this little baby into into um out into this big world but but things are beginning to intensify i believe we can see intensity i believe the labor pains are going to continue to get more serious we're going to see the earthquakes growing in intensity and in frequency we're going to see the storms even the super storms that have been prophesied and talked about and even predicted scientifically we're going to see more signs in the heavens as the scripture talks about we're going to see those signs becoming more frequent and more intense what you can basically do is take all of the signs that are mentioned in the scripture as being a part of the beginning of the labor pains and you can you can know for sure that all of those things will continue to happen right up until the time of the second coming all the way through the period of the rapture resurrection of the bride and right into the last three and a half years of tribulation that we refer to as the great wrath they're going to continue to be more intense and more frequent jesus talks about these things as i mentioned a moment ago in several places one is matthew 24 one is luke chapter 21. you can look at that and even mark talks about some of the very same things in mark chapter 13 and verse 37 our lord said what i say to one i say to all watch and i think that's good advice we need to watch and pray we need to be a people who are able to discern the signs of the end time and we need to kind of be able to to prophetically gauge where we are in this process um i think we're approaching the end of the end of all things i really believe that we're going to see uh the earth what what this is about is the earth itself is in labor there's something that is to be born there's something that is to come forth i believe part of that which is to come forth is the adoption of sons the manifestation of the bride of jesus christ and again as we've mentioned in earlier broadcasts this move of the spirit that we have referred to as the bride's revival is going to cause separation because it's going to bring you into a place where you're no longer satisfied with church as usual you're no longer satisfied with a with a warmed over message or with the entertainment that the church seems to be so good at these days your heart is crying for more uh you know that worship i think you're beginning to know as god pulled you the deep calling to the deep that worship is not about entertaining the listeners or the worshipers the so-called worshipers worship is about engaging it's about setting your mind and your focus on the lord jesus christ and just loving him and adoring him it's not about a rock concert it's not about being stimulated musically it's about an atmosphere being created so that we can have communion with him and so that we can begin to prepare our hearts to hear the revelation of his word uh i think that we can look at the birth pains that are mentioned in the scripture and we can sort of classify them into 10 different categories and i want to begin to talk about those 10 categories with you today and i want us to to count down i want us to count from the number 10 all the way down to the number one and we're going to be counting in significance relative to current issues and events which means we're going to start with number 10 and these are the 10 main categories of the birth pains that are happening in the world today and again that will increase in intensity and the period of time between these birth pains that that's going to get shorter and shorter so the frequency uh is going to change and we're going to start seeing these things happening at such a rapid fire secession one right after another and uh people are going to begin to to realize that the earth is going through a transition a transformation because something is is coming the kingdom of god is coming and the earth is in birth pains the earth is a part of god's creation and the world that we live in right now is going through labor it it really is and that is the explanation for the for the shifting of the plates beneath the earth's surface that is the explanation for super storms and tsunamis and a lot of the things that are happening in the world it's the earth itself going through transition going through labor pains to get ready to to bring forth the kingdom of god of which you and i have been called to be a part of so i'm going to start with number 10 and count down number 10 jesus said there will be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars even in the heavens luke chapter 21 and verse 25 says just that and this is yeshua the lord jesus speaking and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring so not only the earth the earth shaking the heavens also declaring that something is going on signs in the sun and the moon and in the stars and we're having a lot of breakthroughs in science in this hour where we're able to understand some of the things that have happened and the predictions of things that are coming this whole idea or realities not just an idea or a theory it's a reality these solar flares that are going on way above the earth's atmosphere but they have the potential of doing extreme damage on planet earth especially in the area of technology and communications so we not only have uh to to look ahead to things going on in the heavens in the sun and the moon and the stars but we also have to in some way prepare ourselves for the effect that these signs in the heavenlies will have on planet earth and i am i am sorry to admit that we have all become extremely dependent on technology uh cellular technology digital transfer of of information and files and the internet and wi-fi and uh all of the ways you know we we have our phones and our other devices and uh and and i'm i'm honest i depend on a lot of those things and but there may come a time as the heavens begin to show forth these signs and wonders and solar flares and more asteroids and more comets and all of these things that are happening even as we have just had this tragedy uh not too long ago in russia uh where where uh so many people were injured and some even lost their lives and uh uh there is certainly the potential for more of these kinds of things to happen as we approach uh the coming of the lord and we need to be aware of that we need to keep pen and paper around uh we may go back to stamps we may there may be periods of time where we do not have access to uh email and and uh internet and it would it would be devastating for some of us and but you know god is going to get the attention of this world he is going to get our attention he is coming as a thief in the night there's no doubt about that but the scripture tells us that this earth is not going to be able to say we didn't have any warning at all no because any time that the refining fires of the lord the evaluation of the lord comes to the earth where god looks down and begins to evaluate things for the purpose of judgment and justice when he does that he always sends a message of warning and so here is the way it is in this hour it's like two sides of the same coin uh it's like as so many people have said now it's like charles dickens wrote in a tale of two cities it was the best of times it was the worst of times or vice versa that's really where we are we're going to see some awful things happening in the world but on the other hand the bride of christ is going to raise up and function in the power and in the authority of god and as we mentioned last week in the very power of the creative spoken word i believe that there's going to be a quick short move of god that's going to show the glory of god in even unprecedented ways in the end time i don't think it's going to be a long drawn-out process i think it's going to be quick and it's going to be short but i think a part of that is going to be unbelievable amounts of just raw power of god on display i was told years ago prophetically that one of the hallmarks of the great move of god in the bride's revival was going to be the unprecedented numbers of people resurrected from the dead and you say oh you know that that's far out there well it wasn't far out there in the ministry of the lord jesus christ and he said uh when they asked the question you know what what must we do that we might work the works of of our god or of our father we might work the works of god he began to explain to them uh i'm gonna go away but i'm gonna send you something i'm going to send you another comforter and in another place he said i'm going to come to you he came with his spirit and his power so that you and i would be able to to do even more the greater works of god that that that you have seen me do you're going to do even greater than that that was his promise and so i think we're going to see the bride of christ functioning on a level of power and authority that's just going to shock the devil's socks off however he's going to continue to to to do the things that he has power and authority to do and so we need to stay under the blood of jesus there's no doubt about that and we need to be aware that these things are coming and in some way we need to be prepared to to minister to people because uh they're not going to be able to find their help from their own government they're not going to be able to find their help from the traditional church even in many cases they're going to need the bride of christ wherever wherever she is they're going to need us and so we need to start preparing ourselves to be the answer because remember i i made mention of a quote that that brother william branham shared many many years ago he said there's got to be an end time message raise up that will meet the conditions of the end time something that will take us all the way back to the original word something that will prepare us for what's coming on the earth both the bad and the good so jesus is clear number 10 one of the birth pains that will that we will see we are seeing but we will see it increase in frequency and in intensity and that is the signs in the sun and in the moon and the stars and i have all kinds of instances here that i could read to you but i think you know i mean people are even reporting uh the the sighting of unidentified flying objects you know even the intensity of that and i know some of that's hocus pocus i know some of that is is people's imagination but i also know that that some of what people are saying is happening both in the realm of the demonic and in the realm of the angelic and so some of the things that people are seeing in the sky is is a sign of the demonic principalities that are moving throughout the atmosphere of the earth between the earth and the second heaven and people are seeing some of that so some of it is of an evil nature i also believe that there are investigating judgment angels who who are are coming down watching over the earth looking at the circumstances of what's going on on this planet and sometimes they're being seen by the naked eye and of course people describe them as flying saucers and rings of light and so forth but i think a lot of times what people are seeing there's a natural a natural explanation for i also believe that people are seeing both demonic activity and angelic activity which we can expect to see that increase again in frequency and intensity our eyes need not be focused on these things our eyes need to be focused on the lord jesus but you can tell your friends and loved ones that we're going to see more unbelievable signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars we're moving toward the time of great wrath and as we do we're going to see a lot of things happening number nine we're counting backward remember is violence on the earth this is going to increase in frequency and intensity luke chapter 17 verse 26 says and as it was in the days of noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man and if you want to know how it was in the days of noah we go to genesis chapter 6 verse 11 describes the the atmosphere uh of the earth of the world at the time genesis 6 11 said the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence we have seen unprecedented violence in the last few years um almost you know in well not almost inhumane in i mean non-human violence violence of such a degree of evil where people would be so violent toward one another with no regard for for the life of a woman or for the life of a child or even the light any life any life but it's hard for us to comprehend uh the violence that has gone on around the world not just the school shootings and the movie theater shootings and and and some of that that we've seen the the terrorism also that is so rampant across the world and and uh people not caring about the fact that that their innocent lives we're not just talking about army against army we're talking about innocent people being caught in the crossfire of just sheer violence and it is a fulfillment of the words of the lord jesus in luke 17 26 and the description of genesis 6 11 the earth was filled with violence in the time of noah and in genesis verse 6 chapter 6 verse 13 and god said to noah the end of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth so all you've got to do is look at the headlines and know that violence is increasing around the world and it is a uh it is certainly a direct parallel with what was happening in the days of noah you do a little bit bit of research into that you will find out that there was unprecedented evil in uh operating in the time of noah uh there were demon spirits that were that were uh moving and defiling and and fallen angels and there was a whole scenario that we won't get into in this broadcast that was going on in genesis 6 of a of a unprecedented nature of just unparalleled evil uh regardless of how you interpret genesis 6 it is clear to see that satan was involved the enemy was involved and it produced something uh that that the world is still dealing with to this day and now we're seeing the intensity of this kind of evil and this kind of violence and i mentioned terrorism we're talking about not just in the middle east we're talking about all over the world we're talking about people being murdered we're talking about bombs that kill innocent people we're talking about people who feel like they're doing god a service by killing other people and we can expect unfortunately to see that which has been previously known as the beginning of sorrows we're about to see that trans uh grass or transition i guess you'd say into something a whole lot more hard to deal with and so we're going to need the power of god in our lives to be able to stand against some of those things that are happening in the world i want you to know that no matter how how much evil is out there how much violence is out there no matter what kind of signs are going on we as the elect of god the bride of christ will be able to stand faithful and true we need to examine our relationship with the lord in this hour i want to encourage you to do that if you're just a christian in name because you want people to know you're not a heathen or you're or you're not some other religion maybe you say i'm a christian because you want people to know or to distinguish you between a buddhist or a muslim or some other faith and so you just use the term christian as some sort of identification i'm telling you that's not enough we need a personal relationship with the lord jesus christ and it is available and it's easier to have than what you might have imagined you don't have to have all the religious trappings to be able to meet jesus you don't have to be in church to meet him you don't have to hear a preacher preach to meet him you can meet him right where you are right now all over the world whatever you're what wherever you are if you're on your job listening to this if you're in a public place watching this program or in the privacy of your home you can meet the lord jesus christ yeshua our messiah you can meet him right where you are by inviting him to come into your life perhaps you once knew the lord and you have given your life to him but you're in a state of of really sliding back you're in the state of of sort of going in the other direction i i i just implore you i encourage you from the bottom of my heart don't run away from the only thing that can provide safety and security for you in the last days don't run away from the only hope that the world has that is salvation through the blood of the lord jesus christ he is the way jesus said i am the way the truth and the life and you know what i believe him i believe he is the way and the truth and the life don't reject him now if you come from another religion you've been raised in another faith i encourage you to read the word of god uh read the four gospels matthew mark luke and john the first four books of the new testament it it describes the life and ministry of jesus it gives us so many of his sermons and words and see if the holy spirit will come to you and reveal to you that jesus is the messiah he is the way of salvation and he does provide hope for you and i in the end time i want to pray for you right now because i don't want to just teach you some facts i want to lead you to a deeper walk a deeper relationship with the lord father i ask you right now for every precious person watching this program no matter where they are in the world come holy spirit come spirit of god and reveal yourself to those who are listening to the sound of my voice i'm asking you to come with your light come with your love come with your hope and deliver and set captives free lord for the believer who's watching this release joy and encouragement in their life and the the revelation of your word i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ yeshua our messiah amen thank you
