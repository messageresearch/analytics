Description:
Through every generation, a hidden people have carried His flame. Now, in the final hour, the call resounds again — not just to believe, but to become the evidence of His power. The same Spirit that raised Christ now stirs a Bride to rise — fearless, radiant, unstoppable. As darkness deepens, her light only burns brighter. This is her time. Why not now? Why not us?

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to do his will to will his will not my will his will. How is it accomplished? By the Mark 16 company. There have been Mark 16 companies, groups of men and women from the time of the day of Pentecost, Shàuote all the way through. They've been on the earth uh through all the darkest ages through every one of the seven church ages. God has not left himself without a witness or without a Mark 16 company of people but the prophesied the prophesied pre-planned elected predestinated Mark 16 company OF FULLY ADOPTED sons could not have come forth in Ephesus to the Ephesian church age or in the Philadelphia church age. They could only be raised up, that manchild company could only be raised up in the last of the last days. As Leodysia, the seventh church age is coming to a close &gt;&gt; and a bride is getting her marching orders. &gt;&gt; And once again, we find ourselves in a lapover age. &gt;&gt; The closing hours of Leodysia around us. And yet there's an invitation to a bride to become a wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're no longer just to be the espouseed. &gt;&gt; We're to be the demonstrators. &gt;&gt; The provers of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's depending on us. You know why God's not working with you confirming his resurrection? Because you're not working with him. &gt;&gt; It's real simple. If I'm not working with him, he's not working with me. Well, how do I work with him? You believe what you say. You say what he said &gt;&gt; and you believe it when it comes out of your mouth. &gt;&gt; And and and then you ask, "Well, what if I don't believe it the first time I say it?" You already know the answer to that. Brother Brandham gave us the answer to that. He said, "You just keep saying it until YOU BELIEVE IT. I AM HEALED. I AM HEALED. I am healed. I am healed." Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; I am healed. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Before we can even get a grasp of a restoration back to Mark 16, God's already saying to us in the same book, in the same message, in the SAME BIBLE, THAT WE NOT ONLY NEED TO GO BACK to to the same power and authority of Mark 16, but that we're actually supposed TO OPERATE IN ANOTHER PORTION OF THAT, &gt;&gt; AN ADDITIONAL OUTPOURING OF THAT. We call it from the third seal, a bride's revival. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHERE HE TELLS US THERE'S revivals here, there's revivals there. The churches have burned out on revival, but the bride has never had a revival yet. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER TYPE OF NOT ONLY RESTORATION, but restitution. IT'S ALSO A TYPE OF THE SPIRIT THAT WAS ON Moses being multiplied and falling on 70 more. &gt;&gt; It's also a type of the day of Pentecost when the same LIFE THAT WAS IN CHRIST JESUS NOW POURS OUT ON 120 &gt;&gt; WHO STUMBLE OUT INTO THE STREETS AND MAKE THOUSANDS. &gt;&gt; You see, a lot of people are convinced that these things diminish. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Because darkness increases. &gt;&gt; If the if the world is getting darker and the church is getting looser, then the bride ought to be getting brighter and operating in more power and more authority to get out of here. &gt;&gt; God didn't send Elijah back. Amen. &gt;&gt; HE TOOK HIM OFF THE scene &gt;&gt; because he WAS GOING TO SEND A DOUBLE PORTION OF THAT SPIRIT &gt;&gt; on Elisha. [screaming] &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And in THE SAME MANNER, THE CORPORAL BODY OF JESUS CHRIST DIDN'T COME BACK after it was ascending here when we were reading about it earlier, &gt;&gt; BUT THE SAME SPIRIT THAT WAS IN HIM, &gt;&gt; it came back. &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? &gt;&gt; Fell on 120. we said a moment AGO THAT QUICKLY BECAME THOUSANDS. SO, IT'S NOT THE PHYSICAL return of a body, a man that we're looking for, but it's a fulfillment, a full installment, a completion of everything THAT WE SAW DEMONSTRATED in that life. YOU SEE, A WAVE SHEATH OFFERING IS THAT a wave sheath offering. Someone has to come to maturity FIRST TO ENCOURAGE US THAT THERE WILL BE A FURTHERANCE OF THE MATURITY IN THE HARVEST. &gt;&gt; And this time it won't be one stalk. It's the WHOLE FIELD. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE WHOLE FIELD. &gt;&gt; NOW THAT IS WHAT HE SAID. &gt;&gt; Why not now? &gt;&gt; Why not me? WHY NOT US? &gt;&gt; LET'S GET HER DONE AND GET OUT OF HERE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE IS A LAND. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A [screaming] LAND. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
