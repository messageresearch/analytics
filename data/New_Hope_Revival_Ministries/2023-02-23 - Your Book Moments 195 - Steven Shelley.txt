Description:
There’s a battle going on and that battle is to get everything written of you in God’s book to come to pass, that’s your destiny, that’s His plan, that’s His will and we’re batting to get that to come to pass on the earth. The way we battle for our destiny is not with guns. The way we battle for our destiny is with tears, it’s with prayer, it’s with fasting, it’s with seeking the Lord.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
no matter what a mess you made no matter how we really really really got off course he can redeem every year [Music] you better and I we better be busy finding out what the Lord has in our book come on and doing what he has we don't have time to pick up somebody else's dream or burden or Vision or thought we better just pick up and find out what the Lord has already written about us you knew every decision before I ever made it the consequences of every decision you knew the years that I would sometimes waste spinning my wheels because I had made a bad choice and I had sought to do my own will and not your will I want you to know today every bit of that can be redeemed I want to say that very carefully again you are not just a church member out there somewhere you were a part of the elected predestinated seed of Jesus Christ and because of that nothing about you nothing concerning you is unredeemable he can redeem every thought that he ever had toward you no matter what a mess I made no matter what a mess you made no matter how we really really really got off course he can redeem every year he can redeem every month he can redeem every hour to see every child of God has a book written about him or her God saw us in our fleshly form in the earth before we ever existed he saw our days he saw it all including our choices and decisions he knew then about our abilities our strengths he knew our gifts even then before the foundation of the world these thoughts were then recorded in the Heavenly record the death and Kingdom Purpose for each of Our Lives was written long before we were ever born not just the number of them but he saw the activities in them and he saw what we would accomplish in our lives our individual book is a written record of all which God planned for us and the kingdom impact that he has destined for each of Our Lives there's a battle going on and the battle is to get whatever is in the book about your life to manifest here on the Earth want to say it again there's a battle going on and that battle is to get everything written of you in God's book to come to pass at your destiny that's his plan that's his will are battling to get that to come to pass here on the earth and let me tell you something the way we battle for our destiny is not with guns the way we battle for our destiny is with tears it's with prayer it's with fasting it's with seeking the Lord even our Lord Jesus Christ 100 God 100 man was still on the earth and every day of his life here on the earth he was living out the volume of the book that had been written about him that's powerful it speaks of the sovereignty of God it speaks of the obedience to the commission and it speaks to every battle that our Lord went through the Bible said though he were a son yet learned he obedience what by the things he suffered and though he was tempted in all like manner as we are what did the Bible say about his overcoming power yet without sin so even our Lord was restrained to a life and a Ministry that had already been written in a book about him because Jesus was a hundred percent man he had a will how do we know that Gethsemane not my will nevertheless if at all possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless what did he say not my will so just because you have a book written about your life doesn't mean you don't have a will and it doesn't mean that there will not be times many times that your will and his will will be in conflict and it is in that moment that we must learn to quickly throw ourselves on the mercy of The Rock because whosoever followeth upon the rock shall be what broken but whosoever the rock shall fall upon shall be crushed to powder so it's better for you to say oh god I've been striving for my will throw yourself on the rock you will but your will be done
