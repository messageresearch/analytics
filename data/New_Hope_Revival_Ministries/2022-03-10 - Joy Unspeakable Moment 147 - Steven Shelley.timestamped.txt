[0:00] there is a joy
[0:03] that can't be told
[0:05] it can't be explained
[0:08] it can only be experienced
[0:17] it's joy unspeakable
[0:21] there is a joy that you can't describe
[0:25] there's a joy that you can't explain
[0:29] it's not based on our circumstances
[0:32] it is the gift of god it is the joy of
[0:35] the lord so i want to say to you church
[0:38] of the living god today if you can't say
[0:40] it don't be ashamed to spray it now i
[0:44] don't mean spit
[0:46] i'm not encouraging anybody to spit when
[0:49] they get happy that's not what i'm
[0:50] saying at all i'm basically saying let
[0:54] it out
[0:57] if you can't explain it
[0:59] don't try to contain it
[1:03] because david found a joy
[1:07] that was so real
[1:09] that he began to take off his outer
[1:12] garments
[1:14] and dance before the lord in his inner
[1:18] tunic which we might call his underwear
[1:21] [Applause]
[1:23] i wouldn't encourage you to dance before
[1:26] the lord in here
[1:28] in your underwear
[1:30] but i'm not going to criticize somebody
[1:33] who has tasted a water from a well that
[1:37] they don't know how to contain
[1:40] i don't want to contain it
[1:43] i don't want to cap it up
[1:46] i don't want to silence my praise
[1:50] come on now
[1:53] i've gotta let it out i gotta praise god
[1:56] and praise god of praise and i gotta let
[1:58] it out
[1:59] [Music]
[2:00] why wouldn't you wanna praise him
[2:04] i wanna see people that god can use and
[2:06] step into you and use you for his glory
[2:09] and until we get to that place i want to
[2:12] see you experiencing a joy that is
[2:15] unspeakable and full of glory
[2:18] so within reason you don't have to worry
[2:21] about me stopping your praise in fact
[2:23] i'm going to be the one up here with as
[2:24] a cheerleader trying to get you to
[2:26] praise him more
[2:31] [Music]
[2:32] because that is how you find a place
[2:36] of trust
[2:38] and confidence in him
[2:41] there is a joy
[2:43] that can't be told
[2:46] it can't be explained
[2:48] it can only be experienced
[2:51] it finds a way of expression
[2:54] you may not understand somebody waving a
[2:57] flag
[2:58] you may not understand somebody waving
[3:01] their arms like a like waving an
[3:03] airplane into its slot
[3:06] you may not understand somebody
[3:08] trembling like this in the presence of
[3:10] the lord
[3:11] you may be like those who come and said
[3:13] i don't know why they're all crying
[3:16] you may wonder why somebody's laughing
[3:19] right in church
[3:21] all these things may feel foreign to you
[3:24] but i want to tell you there's a joy
[3:26] that's unspeakable
[3:28] but full of glory
[3:31] you know what glory is it's the
[3:32] atmosphere of heaven fill this house
[3:36] with the atmosphere of heaven
