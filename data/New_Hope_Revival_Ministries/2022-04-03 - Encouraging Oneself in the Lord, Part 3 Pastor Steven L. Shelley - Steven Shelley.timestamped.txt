[44:00] moment
[44:01] we don't want that anointing to lift
[44:03] right now we want jesus to have his way
[44:07] [Music]
[44:09] if you came expecting a program we have
[44:11] no program for you
[44:14] we have no plan we've just come today
[44:17] to yield ourselves to the lord
[44:21] and i know that many of you realized
[44:25] that after the service last night and
[44:27] all through the night and perhaps this
[44:29] morning
[44:31] many could feel that swirling and
[44:34] warfare i know
[44:36] i know they don't like to talk about
[44:38] that
[44:39] but i want you to know when jesus starts
[44:41] doing something
[44:43] demons get stirred up
[44:46] strongholds
[44:48] they try to advance and be stronger
[44:52] but you know there's a way to break
[44:53] through the darkness
[44:56] it's by the name of jesus
[44:59] there's a way to get the victory and
[45:01] it's by the name of jesus how many of
[45:04] you believe that
[45:06] why don't you just shout amen right now
[45:10] just a few minutes before we came out
[45:12] here i
[45:14] i sent megan a text and i said be ready
[45:18] just be ready to sing this
[45:21] i know this is not everybody's cup of
[45:23] tea
[45:25] and when i come to your house
[45:27] i'll drink your brand
[45:30] i won't bring my own tea bags
[45:33] i'll drink whatever you give me
[45:36] come on
[45:38] but i get to pick the tea today
[45:41] so i'd like for you to look over
[45:43] anything that's not your style or what
[45:46] you're used to
[45:48] but we have learned that praise
[45:51] is not just lifting the lord
[45:54] it's more than that
[45:55] it's scattering darkness
[45:58] this pushing strongholds out of the way
[46:02] and lies
[46:04] lies get scattered
[46:06] when god's people prays
[46:09] we understand that sometimes we are
[46:11] moving into a place of blessing and
[46:13] praise and sometimes we're warring
[46:17] we don't fight flesh and blood
[46:20] but powers and principalities and
[46:24] spiritual wickedness in high places
[46:28] and i want to megan to come and sing
[46:31] this song to again it may not be your
[46:34] it may not be uh
[46:37] what do they call orange pico or
[46:41] darjeeling
[46:43] or
[46:45] sleepy tea or whatever they have
[46:47] but this is my cup of tea
[46:50] because i've watched god break through
[46:54] chains and fetters and yokes
[46:58] when god's people recognize
[47:01] that we are not shadowboxing
[47:04] fighting an invisible enemy
[47:07] but we're fighting an enemy that likes
[47:09] to break through and manifest himself in
[47:13] this realm
[47:14] so we have to be strategic in prayer
[47:18] and we have to be strategic in praise
[47:22] and how we move
[47:24] and i want you to know you can step over
[47:26] the anointing
[47:28] and cause spiritual whiplash
[47:32] your neck kind of gets sore because
[47:34] you're moving and then you come to a
[47:36] solid stop
[47:38] and it's hard some time to learn the
[47:40] flow
[47:42] of the spirit of god and how his
[47:43] anointing works but we must discover
[47:48] god's heart
[47:49] for our time together this morning
[47:53] and i want you to just
[47:56] worship the lord
[47:57] with me i i gotta i gotta do this and i
[48:00] don't wanna give you whiplash
[48:03] but i gotta do
[48:04] this this morning the lord dealt with my
[48:07] heart
[48:09] several things were really really
[48:11] stirring in my spirit are you all right
[48:12] to stand you folks all right
[48:15] we're going to finish up with this song
[48:17] before we move on
[48:20] god reminded me of a vision i don't
[48:22] often get up here and talk about my
[48:24] visions
[48:25] but i am today for just a moment because
[48:28] he reminded me
[48:29] of something he showed me years ago and
[48:31] i've seen this play out
[48:34] time and time again and if this chokes
[48:36] you i apologize in advance
[48:39] but i feel like i need to read this into
[48:41] the atmosphere
[48:43] because as i said i've watched this play
[48:45] out
[48:46] over and over and over again
[48:49] i saw a long row of cabbage growing in a
[48:51] vegetable garden
[48:53] and each plant had large beautiful
[48:55] leaves with varied shades of green
[48:58] and i walked closer looking down over
[49:00] several plants and i noticed that there
[49:03] were leaves hanging free and loose
[49:05] i saw tiny little heads
[49:08] that were forming in the center of each
[49:10] cabbage plant and i looked over this
[49:12] garden scene and i heard a voice say
[49:15] it's coming to a head
[49:17] do you hear me
[49:20] i heard a voice say it's coming to a
[49:23] head
[49:24] the scene quickly changed and i saw a
[49:26] festering blister
[49:28] on someone's skin
[49:30] i could see that it looked rather flat
[49:33] against the skin but i noticed tiny red
[49:36] streaks
[49:37] indicative of infection moving from the
[49:39] sore across the unbroken skin
[49:42] as i looked on impurity began to form
[49:45] under the blister and i watched it as it
[49:47] came to a head
[49:49] again i heard a voice say it's coming to
[49:52] a head
[49:53] i then saw a red-hot edge of a knife
[49:56] blade as it moved in
[49:59] and tenderly nicked the blister causing
[50:02] all of the poison and the corruption to
[50:05] run free
[50:07] and then i looked on
[50:09] and i saw the hot edge of the knife
[50:12] gently laid against the sore
[50:15] cauterizing it
[50:17] sealing it up
[50:19] to prevent
[50:21] re-infection
[50:24] i believe that part of this warring in
[50:28] the spirit is because
[50:30] once again god through these meetings
[50:34] friday night and last night
[50:36] i believe god was allowing things to
[50:38] come to the head
[50:39] because he by the spirit of god wants to
[50:42] deal with those things
[50:44] in every one of us
[50:46] now he is a perfect gentleman
[50:49] and he is not going to move against your
[50:52] will
[50:54] you know he could
[50:56] how many of you know he knows how to
[50:58] break our will
[51:00] he can do that but he doesn't want to do
[51:02] that
[51:03] he wants you to want him
[51:06] is that okay
[51:07] he wants you to want him
[51:10] and he wants you to need him
[51:13] he's our bridegroom
[51:14] he's our husband
[51:16] and he longs to be desired and wanted
[51:20] and invited to come in and deal with
[51:22] whatever it is
[51:23] that's festering in our lives just
[51:26] beneath the surface of the skin
[51:29] so as we sing this song i don't know
[51:31] what your sores are
[51:33] i don't know what god wants to bring to
[51:35] a head in your life but i know this
[51:38] he wants to so deliver
[51:41] and so heal you
[51:43] and so release all the toxin and the
[51:46] poison out of our life
[51:48] and then come with a hot sword
[51:51] and seal it up
[51:54] am i saying that right caught our eyes
[51:58] i used to be uh afflicted with mouth
[52:01] ulcers as a child and they would get so
[52:04] bad that my cheeks were already puffy
[52:07] but they would swell up like a chipmunk
[52:10] and they would get so infected that i
[52:13] would have to go to the dentist and have
[52:15] them cauterized burned so that they
[52:18] would seal up so the bacteria would stay
[52:21] out
[52:22] if you and i in this moment of time
[52:25] would offer god anything and everything
[52:29] in our lives that lays beneath the
[52:32] surface that the enemy tries to stir us
[52:35] or pull us or move us out of god's
[52:37] divine will for our lives if you will
[52:41] offer that up to him today
[52:44] i believe he'll come with a hot edge of
[52:46] a spiritual sword
[52:48] i believe that he will prick that sore
[52:51] and let that poison and toxicity drain
[52:54] out of whatever that circumstance or
[52:57] situation is and if you'll tarry long
[53:00] enough i believe he'll come
[53:02] and lay that same sword the same sword
[53:06] that cuts open it's the same sword that
[53:09] heals i believe he wants to heal us
[53:12] today
[53:13] i believe he wants to help our sore
[53:15] necks
[53:16] i believe he wants us to move with him
[53:19] today how many of you are interested in
[53:21] moving with the lamb

[1:18:32] there have been
[1:18:34] both nights
[1:18:36] lives impacted around this altar
[1:18:39] i know that god has ministered directly
[1:18:43] to people's needs as they responded to
[1:18:46] the word
[1:18:48] and i have no reason to doubt today
[1:18:51] will be any less
[1:18:53] fact i
[1:18:54] my faith is saying it ought to be a
[1:18:56] little more

[1:19:00] close out these three meetings

[1:19:04] we're so thankful that god has sent you
[1:19:07] our way we love sister anna we love the
[1:19:10] whole family and it's going to be very
[1:19:13] hard to see some of them leaving us now
[1:19:16] but we know that it has to be that way
[1:19:19] god has a time and a season for all
[1:19:21] things he brings us together and
[1:19:24] sometimes we have to part but i get
[1:19:27] a glimpse every now and again in a
[1:19:30] service
[1:19:31] of that hour where we'll never say
[1:19:34] goodbye again
[1:19:37] anybody looking forward to that
[1:19:39] we just fellowship in his presence for
[1:19:42] all eternity

[1:20:11] heal and set free and deliver and
[1:20:15] rebuke at times

[1:20:20] your word and we acknowledge the gift in
[1:20:23] our brother's life and we pray that you
[1:20:25] will use him as you see fit today

[1:20:36] help us today and help our brother

[1:20:47] somehow
[1:20:49] and i love him
[1:20:52] too much

[1:20:58] one of my favorite songs brother greeley
[1:20:59] can we do a verse of that together
[1:21:03] and i told him
[1:21:05] that i loved him
[1:21:08] it was easy
[1:21:13] but harder
[1:21:15] to prove
[1:21:18] when temptation
[1:21:20] should came my way
[1:21:25] our broken promises
[1:21:28] i counted
[1:21:31] them but lost
[1:21:33] till i caught
[1:21:36] a glimpse of true love
[1:21:38] hanging
[1:21:40] on a rugged cross and i love him
[1:21:46] too much
[1:21:51] [Music]
[1:21:57] much
[1:22:02] [Applause]

[1:22:28] may he help me never fail him again
[1:22:32] and may he give me the continued grace
[1:22:35] that when i slip
[1:22:36] and when i fall and i make a mistake may
[1:22:39] he be right there to catch me
[1:22:42] did i mess it up i messed it up my big
[1:22:45] old ears
[1:22:46] if i have to joshua or ben
[1:22:49] if i have to just get me a cordless and
[1:22:51] we'll give this thing to somebody it
[1:22:53] fits i want to say thank you to the band
[1:22:55] this morning you all have done admirably
[1:22:57] this weekend
[1:22:59] yes very anointed
[1:23:02] i'm going to ask a favor of you
[1:23:04] so benjamin we've we've tried to utilize
[1:23:07] some of our friends and our family but
[1:23:09] as we come to a close here in a few
[1:23:11] minutes if you guys would rush back i'm
[1:23:13] gonna do a song with just my guitar this
[1:23:15] morning here in a minute but i want you
[1:23:16] guys to go get a drink of water find a
[1:23:18] comfortable seat we're going to do a
[1:23:20] little recap so we'll dismiss you and
[1:23:22] we'll read the scripture but you may be
[1:23:24] seated this morning before we read the
[1:23:26] scripture i just have it on my heart to
[1:23:29] encourage you in a couple things
[1:23:31] you've heard me refer to brother branham
[1:23:34] quite frequently throughout the weekend
[1:23:36] and we'll be doing just a little bit
[1:23:38] more of that this morning
[1:23:41] because god
[1:23:43] dealt with my family supernaturally i
[1:23:45] often when i've traveled overseas i've
[1:23:47] shared the testimony of my father
[1:23:51] we honor my mom and dad for being with
[1:23:53] us today and it's such a privilege for
[1:23:54] me to get to minister the gospel in
[1:23:56] front of my father who i grew up hearing
[1:23:59] preached such beautiful sermons that he
[1:24:01] got from the message of the hour i
[1:24:05] really well remember him talking about
[1:24:08] god didn't he didn't make a law that
[1:24:11] said the next person that looks at that
[1:24:13] light on the end they're going to die
[1:24:15] god didn't make a law and then
[1:24:17] and he used me as a type and he said if
[1:24:20] i was god he didn't send
[1:24:22] his son i didn't send daniel to die in
[1:24:25] your stead
[1:24:28] dad was teaching me
[1:24:30] the singularity of god and how that god
[1:24:33] himself created a flesh body and poured
[1:24:36] himself into it
[1:24:38] i remember that sermon
[1:24:40] on that muddy river road in that little
[1:24:42] old church it's still there
[1:24:45] i remember years later dad getting
[1:24:46] inspiration and he had three jars and he
[1:24:49] wrote on the jars brother shelly he
[1:24:51] wrote faith
[1:24:52] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[1:24:56] kindness and love and he wrote the words
[1:24:58] out on the jar and he would set him on
[1:25:00] the pulpit and he would bring a jug and
[1:25:02] the jug was a type of the holy spirit
[1:25:04] and he had two other jars he had a jar
[1:25:07] that was full
[1:25:08] uh or on the outside it was all dirty
[1:25:10] and unclean
[1:25:12] and it was my life and he would teach
[1:25:14] how that jar got all messed up in the
[1:25:17] world
[1:25:18] and how that if we just come into the
[1:25:19] presence of god the washing of the water
[1:25:22] i think my son-in-law mentioned it to me
[1:25:24] there's waters of separation in our life
[1:25:27] and it begins to wash away the things
[1:25:30] and it'll empty out the dirt from inside
[1:25:32] our life
[1:25:33] and dad had a jar that he had
[1:25:36] uh filled early in the day and it had
[1:25:39] spirit in it but it had a little dirt in
[1:25:41] the bottom
[1:25:43] and as the day went on that dirt would
[1:25:46] settle so flat there'd just be a little
[1:25:47] bit of brown
[1:25:49] and dad would preach in power and
[1:25:51] demonstration about how our life we come
[1:25:53] into the presence of the lord and god
[1:25:55] cleans us up and he wants to set us
[1:25:57] aside for service
[1:25:59] and he said but too many times we don't
[1:26:01] allow the holy ghost to take us all the
[1:26:03] way to the top we might get a little
[1:26:06] faith and we might get a little virtue
[1:26:08] and we don't get it all
[1:26:11] and he had picked that jar up he said in
[1:26:13] the end result is seven times worse and
[1:26:16] he'd shake that jar that that mud had
[1:26:18] settled in and that jar would turn black
[1:26:20] and it would show the condition that our
[1:26:22] life goes back to when we don't get full
[1:26:25] of the holy ghost
[1:26:27] my daddy wouldn't have had the
[1:26:29] inspiration to preach those things
[1:26:32] if he hadn't learned that god sent a
[1:26:34] prophet yes
[1:26:36] amen
[1:26:37] it was 1976 it was the summer before i
[1:26:40] was born and it wasn't just any prophet
[1:26:42] god didn't come and vindicate me last
[1:26:44] night
[1:26:46] oh we've got testimonies from around the
[1:26:48] world of a vindicated prophet i my
[1:26:50] father-in-law is a living witness
[1:26:54] of a vindicated prophet
[1:26:57] i've stood on this stage that's
[1:26:59] featured in this book by julius ted's
[1:27:01] clef
[1:27:02] and it shows the tens of thousands of
[1:27:06] people
[1:27:07] i have talked to some of them on the
[1:27:09] streets of durban that were there my
[1:27:12] wife has sang
[1:27:13] right here facing that uh that which
[1:27:16] brother branham drew a lot bigger crowd
[1:27:18] than we did
[1:27:21] his gift was a lot bigger than mine
[1:27:25] tens of thousands of miracles this book
[1:27:28] is just on the healings that happened in
[1:27:30] africa there's another book in brother
[1:27:32] shelley's office that talks about
[1:27:35] how the mayor of the city gave him a key
[1:27:38] i believe it was and they marched out
[1:27:41] singing only believe singing brother
[1:27:43] branham's theme song his theme was
[1:27:46] hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same
[1:27:50] yesterday today
[1:27:52] and forever
[1:27:54] he does not change if the lord will help
[1:27:56] us today and i know some of you have to
[1:27:58] go i know some of you have to slip out
[1:28:00] but if the lord will help us today the
[1:28:02] challenge of these meetings has
[1:28:05] been to draw us into the holiest of
[1:28:07] holiness the challenge of this meeting
[1:28:10] is to get us to return to that sanctuary
[1:28:14] brother shall he come and he did he did
[1:28:17] oh brother shelley did
[1:28:19] battle this morning
[1:28:22] and i'm so thankful for a man of god
[1:28:24] that will battle in the spirit
[1:28:27] i'm so proud to be somewhere
[1:28:30] where we're not fighting men and women
[1:28:32] but we're fighting spirits and we're
[1:28:34] dealing with spirits
[1:28:37] and we got enough wisdom to know when a
[1:28:39] spirit gets on our wife or a spirit gets
[1:28:42] on our child oh god we need you to do
[1:28:44] something about that
[1:28:46] that's right
[1:28:48] that's right
[1:28:49] oh it's not an angry man
[1:28:52] it's an angry god
[1:28:56] we want to keep him happy
[1:29:00] this is a distant relative of the
[1:29:02] florence nightingale the reason brother
[1:29:04] branham went
[1:29:05] she'd got down to about 50 pounds she'd
[1:29:08] written a letter and she sent an
[1:29:10] airplane ticket with the letter back in
[1:29:12] the 50s you could buy a hard paper
[1:29:13] ticket that was good to use when you
[1:29:15] went to the airport
[1:29:17] we things change in our our society our
[1:29:20] culture things have changed so much this
[1:29:22] little old lady had got down to 50
[1:29:24] pounds
[1:29:26] brother branham went and
[1:29:28] laid hands on her and prayed for and
[1:29:31] i used a bunch of brother shelley's
[1:29:32] cards to mark them because i got to be
[1:29:34] able to tell people where i'm going to
[1:29:35] church
[1:29:40] this was the letter that came when god
[1:29:42] fully healed her yes you say oh brother
[1:29:45] daniel there's many ministries
[1:29:47] with miracles oh
[1:29:48] no you don't understand
[1:29:53] god told my dad in 1976 my mom was
[1:29:57] expecting me and god told my dad he's a
[1:29:59] baptist man
[1:30:02] dad come to my mom one day and he said i
[1:30:04] believe god's coming back janet i
[1:30:07] believe the lord's going to return i
[1:30:08] think the preachers are right the coming
[1:30:10] of the lord is at hand but i begin to
[1:30:12] see in god's word that he sent a
[1:30:14] forerunner before he came the first time
[1:30:17] and dad didn't have any theological
[1:30:19] training he didn't have any seminary
[1:30:21] training but again he got stirred inside
[1:30:23] and he said i think he's going to send a
[1:30:25] forerunner just like john the baptist
[1:30:30] and little did my daddy know
[1:30:32] that there was word for that from
[1:30:34] malachi to jesus himself to the book of
[1:30:38] revelation that talked of an angel that
[1:30:41] was to come
[1:30:43] little did he know that when the
[1:30:45] disciples asked jesus why do the scribes
[1:30:49] say that elias must come that the christ
[1:30:52] prophesied of william branham you say
[1:30:56] brother daniel are you allowed to say
[1:30:57] that if i'm not allowed to say it no one
[1:31:00] is allowed to say it
[1:31:06] jesus said elijah truly shall first come
[1:31:11] and restore
[1:31:13] all
[1:31:14] things
[1:31:18] it's not the ministry of daniel miller
[1:31:21] it's not the ministry of eddie miller
[1:31:23] it's not the ministry of forest farmer
[1:31:26] forest farmer a five-year-old crippled
[1:31:29] boy
[1:31:34] daddy told him you ask him you take him
[1:31:36] out there if you haven't heard this
[1:31:37] testimony you ask him at lunch today
[1:31:40] he's got several to tell he's got a
[1:31:42] brother some of my sisters come up for
[1:31:45] prayer last night wanting god to do
[1:31:46] something for them
[1:31:48] and their reproductive organs
[1:31:51] and oh how it stirred me about spiritual
[1:31:53] food in due season
[1:31:55] and oh how it stirred me
[1:31:58] how it stirred me about my
[1:32:00] granddaughter's namesake gwendolyn who
[1:32:03] stood in that prayer line in spiritual
[1:32:05] food in due season and who the prophet
[1:32:07] of god began to discern the woman in
[1:32:10] front of her and said i see that you got
[1:32:13] a problem in your female organs and he
[1:32:16] said now by the apostolic gift that's
[1:32:19] within me i lay hands on you at the
[1:32:20] command of the word and when brother
[1:32:23] forrest's mother stepped up brother
[1:32:25] branham didn't even have to lay hands on
[1:32:27] her he didn't even have to pray for it
[1:32:29] he said you had female trouble
[1:32:36] oh yes
[1:32:38] the god we serve but if we're not
[1:32:41] careful as brother shelley was talking
[1:32:43] to us about those things this morning
[1:32:45] and how god it's the same sword
[1:32:48] it gets hot
[1:32:52] you don't know what it is to have to
[1:32:54] hold the word of god
[1:32:57] you don't know what it is
[1:32:59] you don't know what it is
[1:33:01] you have to look
[1:33:03] and say
[1:33:04] devil
[1:33:06] i see you
[1:33:08] [Music]
[1:33:14] you criticize a man of god because he
[1:33:16] preaches the word of god
[1:33:18] and may god give us the grace today to
[1:33:20] turn that blade just like that
[1:33:23] get it hot
[1:33:25] and lay that on that open wound
[1:33:28] may the bleeding stop this morning
[1:33:31] you think you're hurting this morning
[1:33:34] you ought to be the preacher
[1:33:36] some of you slept
[1:33:38] bethany told me daddy i got the best
[1:33:40] night's sleep that i've had in months
[1:33:43] i'm gonna have her testified to you this
[1:33:44] morning our testimony is our delivery
[1:33:57] but not all are called to handle the
[1:33:59] sword
[1:34:00] not all are called to do battle in the
[1:34:03] spiritual realm
[1:34:04] not all are called to handle it and cut
[1:34:07] those spirits off of people and to cut
[1:34:09] them up and oh i wish i would have
[1:34:11] killed them dead brother shelly i wish
[1:34:13] they hadn't lingered
[1:34:14] i wish i knew more
[1:34:17] but i'm young in this spiritual battle
[1:34:19] i've been preaching a long time without
[1:34:22] him
[1:34:22] i've been preaching from an intellectual
[1:34:24] conception but by god's grace i go forth
[1:34:27] to hold the word high
[1:34:31] and i will preach
[1:34:33] what he called me to preach
[1:34:36] and i will bring god's deliverance
[1:34:38] wherever he'll send me and i'll do it by
[1:34:41] whatever means necessary
[1:34:45] and if he'll let us this morning we'll
[1:34:47] lay that hot blade on those open wounds
[1:34:49] but you think you were cut up last night
[1:34:52] i went home so bloody i showered and i
[1:34:54] showered and i showered and i prayed
[1:34:58] about three o'clock in the morning the
[1:35:00] presence of the lord come
[1:35:03] there were rainbows on the ceiling and
[1:35:05] there were lights on the walls
[1:35:08] and i bathed in his presence and i knew
[1:35:12] i knew by his grace i'd done what he
[1:35:15] called me to do
[1:35:17] i knew that i'd accomplish the task
[1:35:21] and as i draw these meetings to a close
[1:35:24] and i try to do what the heavenly
[1:35:27] fathers asked me to do
[1:35:29] i wanted to give honor not just to my
[1:35:30] father
[1:35:32] not just to my wife's father but the
[1:35:34] miracle
[1:35:35] of this gift
[1:35:38] brother shelley was preaching a meeting
[1:35:39] in indiana
[1:35:41] i think i've only heard this testimony
[1:35:42] once but now it's mine
[1:35:48] now it's mine
[1:35:49] pentecostal preacher preaching revivals
[1:35:52] laying hands on the sick thank you
[1:35:54] brother luke
[1:35:56] preaching revival laying hands on the
[1:35:58] sick of man walked into the meeting i
[1:36:00] believe brother shelley told me he had
[1:36:01] walked into his father's shop just as he
[1:36:03] fired up a weed eater and it took out
[1:36:05] both eyes one eye part of one eye their
[1:36:08] peace were missing out of one
[1:36:11] and god did
[1:36:13] in at the hands of a servant of god who
[1:36:16] believed that jesus christ was the same
[1:36:19] yesterday oh brother shelly already had
[1:36:21] a revelation of hebrews 13 8
[1:36:24] he knew that the promises of the word of
[1:36:26] god were for this day for this hour for
[1:36:29] this people
[1:36:34] god sent him from that meeting where
[1:36:36] miracles were being done and said i have
[1:36:38] something for you
[1:36:40] in anderson north carolina south
[1:36:43] carolina
[1:36:44] it'll be more mine after today
[1:36:48] he went down there and he began to do
[1:36:49] battle and he began to war and he began
[1:36:51] to find the mind of god he knew god had
[1:36:54] something for him
[1:36:55] and one day
[1:36:58] one day
[1:37:00] a little man walked in he heard him
[1:37:02] preaching on the radio and he thought oh
[1:37:04] i've got to get to my brother
[1:37:06] i've got to get to my brother that's a
[1:37:08] believer that's the believer i have to
[1:37:10] get to my brother brother cleveland i
[1:37:11] believe it was
[1:37:13] come in with a
[1:37:14] little brown bag
[1:37:16] oh church if you ain't got a little
[1:37:17] brown bag
[1:37:19] get your brown bag today we're gonna
[1:37:20] break bread in a few minutes and when we
[1:37:23] break bread we're gonna feast on the
[1:37:24] hidden manna we're gonna feast on the
[1:37:27] fruits of the land we're gonna eat
[1:37:29] whatever he provides for us to eat today
[1:37:31] take your brown bag when you leave take
[1:37:34] it to somebody and share what god has
[1:37:37] done for you
[1:37:40] [Applause]
[1:37:46] it wasn't a church age book that brother
[1:37:48] shelley was given but like many of us we
[1:37:49] stick that stuff away well that's for
[1:37:51] another time or that wasn't what they
[1:37:53] think it is and we've got interpretation
[1:37:55] for what we think it is and we put that
[1:37:57] away and we never even crack the book if
[1:37:59] we're not careful
[1:38:02] we never tell anybody about what our
[1:38:04] family and friends discover
[1:38:08] i told my wife i said you know when i
[1:38:10] was in
[1:38:11] school i had this young lady that seemed
[1:38:13] to be somewhat attracted to me and
[1:38:16] sometimes you get worried about things
[1:38:17] and people think oh you know they're
[1:38:20] only coming because this or you get
[1:38:22] around people that you're around in your
[1:38:23] childhood and it's infatuation or it's
[1:38:25] this or it's that i told my wife i said
[1:38:28] you know really in school
[1:38:30] people weren't attracted to me
[1:38:33] they were really attracted to the jesus
[1:38:35] in me and i didn't even know how to
[1:38:36] manifest him good
[1:38:38] but i've always had a draw to my
[1:38:40] personality and my wife assured me that
[1:38:42] i was right
[1:38:46] because she said you weren't that
[1:38:47] attractive in high school
[1:38:49] [Music]
[1:38:50] that's just the kind of relationship
[1:38:52] that we have
[1:38:54] and i'm so
[1:38:55] and i'm so glad of that
[1:38:59] no she when i shaved my head she was
[1:39:01] like that's it right there that's the
[1:39:03] look we're going for
[1:39:08] brother shelly put that bag that that
[1:39:09] brother gave him he said i believe this
[1:39:11] will bless you i believe you'll like
[1:39:12] this or whatever brother shelley then he
[1:39:14] had one of them union voices
[1:39:17] somebody come come to him i i bet
[1:39:20] i bet what's in that bag is tapes of
[1:39:23] william yes
[1:39:25] and i just want you to know
[1:39:27] that he teaches
[1:39:29] that
[1:39:30] eve
[1:39:31] had sex
[1:39:32] with a rattlesnake that's what he told
[1:39:33] me
[1:39:34] brother shelley lie oh goodness
[1:39:37] he couldn't destroy it but he put it as
[1:39:39] high up on the shelf and put it out of
[1:39:41] sight as far as he could get it
[1:39:47] but that wasn't the end of the story
[1:39:51] so not only can you ask
[1:39:53] my daddy may not be able to communicate
[1:39:54] with you like he used to but my mama
[1:39:57] knows all the stories
[1:40:00] so you can ask my mama while we're
[1:40:02] having lunch here in a few minutes if
[1:40:03] you stick around and she'll tell you
[1:40:05] what god's done in our life you can ask
[1:40:08] brother forrest his stories and he can
[1:40:10] take you from only believe to spiritual
[1:40:12] food new season wherever you want to go
[1:40:15] and if you ain't heard brother shelly's
[1:40:17] story won't you ask him today we'll go
[1:40:19] on a missionary trip together and we'll
[1:40:21] hear about a god that's not just a god
[1:40:23] of history but he's a god of right now
[1:40:26] right now
[1:40:29] you can be stirred inside
[1:40:31] and as we
[1:40:33] wrap up
[1:40:34] friday night and saturday night and we
[1:40:36] hear the word of god
[1:40:38] i've got a portion of two different
[1:40:40] sermons that i'm going to read just to
[1:40:43] try and lay that blade there and seal
[1:40:45] the deal
[1:40:46] but understand the blade's still hot
[1:40:49] it's the same blade it's still hot
[1:40:52] it's going to sting
[1:40:55] brother branham often refers in his
[1:40:57] ministry and i got nice things to say as
[1:40:59] we close the service and that's why i
[1:41:01] i'll be honest with you i don't know as
[1:41:03] much about worship as i do about getting
[1:41:06] in the spirit
[1:41:10] and that's just the truth i know a lot
[1:41:12] of people can bring you to the threshold
[1:41:15] but they can't bring you to the throne
[1:41:18] they can get that anointing around them
[1:41:21] they can get him to come for those in
[1:41:23] need but they can't keep you there until
[1:41:26] you're free
[1:41:29] i've watched it for a lot of years
[1:41:31] i've been in services where they put
[1:41:33] their hand over the mouth of a sister
[1:41:35] that was fixing to speak in tongues i've
[1:41:37] been in services where they pushed them
[1:41:38] to their seat
[1:41:43] i've been in services where things
[1:41:44] disrupted the move of the spirit in the
[1:41:46] natural realm
[1:41:50] jesus himself
[1:41:53] when going to raise jairus daughter
[1:41:56] only took two of the three of the twelve
[1:41:59] disciples
[1:42:01] and when he got to the house
[1:42:03] jesus
[1:42:05] had to put everybody outside
[1:42:09] now i ain't jesus
[1:42:11] i can't tell you why we didn't see more
[1:42:13] miracles but we saw some
[1:42:18] i'm praying for sister rebecca i believe
[1:42:20] it was brother greeley's got her i got
[1:42:22] her she asked for a
[1:42:26] completion i don't
[1:42:28] all of it
[1:42:30] that still gets me
[1:42:32] she asked for all of it
[1:42:34] austin is screaming at me and i can't
[1:42:36] hear him
[1:42:37] i'm standing right here
[1:42:40] and i'm trying to lay hands on her then
[1:42:43] all of a sudden something hits me so
[1:42:45] my wife looks over and thought i was
[1:42:47] getting electrocuted
[1:42:50] i was almost to pass out
[1:42:53] and i'm twisting
[1:42:55] in the anointing and one eye pops open
[1:42:58] and here's brother shelley doing his
[1:43:00] thing
[1:43:03] and i'm like well this is going to be a
[1:43:05] fine howdy duty
[1:43:07] if i get slain in the spirit you're sure
[1:43:09] enough gonna have to clean up this mess
[1:43:13] so i had to get myself together a little
[1:43:15] bit just so we could finish what we were
[1:43:17] doing
[1:43:18] cause my sister was getting a blessing
[1:43:20] but so was ah
[1:43:24] ah will never be the same
[1:43:29] and i will never go back
[1:43:34] no
[1:43:35] only forward there's no back plate in my
[1:43:38] armor
[1:43:39] [Music]
[1:43:42] and it
[1:43:43] and if this
[1:43:45] ain't that
[1:43:47] i'll keep this
[1:43:49] till that comes
[1:43:55] right
[1:44:16] okay
[1:44:23] them prophets
[1:44:25] rebuked them
[1:44:27] i
[1:44:28] don't want it to sting quite that bad
[1:44:36] yeah we'll just skip that it might sting
[1:44:38] too much
[1:44:41] i know you do
[1:44:43] but we're we're trying to stop the
[1:44:45] bleeding
[1:44:47] oneness
[1:44:48] now the church now
[1:44:50] is engaged to christ for the wedding
[1:44:54] the wedding has never been performed yet
[1:44:57] it will be at the wedding supper of the
[1:45:00] lamb
[1:45:01] can you all hear me okay
[1:45:04] so we see that the church is now engaged
[1:45:07] like a man engaged to his wife
[1:45:13] what does he do while they're engaged
[1:45:15] he's just bestowing
[1:45:17] all kinds of things
[1:45:20] sending her presents
[1:45:22] making her feel good
[1:45:25] oh brother shelley i like to worship him
[1:45:27] i didn't know it was this much fun
[1:45:32] it makes me feel good
[1:45:35] now that i know what it's like i'm going
[1:45:36] to keep doing it
[1:45:38] he's just bestowing all kinds of things
[1:45:42] sending her presents making her feel
[1:45:44] good well that's what christ is doing to
[1:45:46] his church
[1:45:47] he's sending us
[1:45:50] gifts of the spirit
[1:45:56] how can you be engaged
[1:45:58] when you're denying
[1:46:00] these gifts
[1:46:02] exist
[1:46:06] it's the very love tokens
[1:46:10] it's god's token to the church
[1:46:14] jesus said so these signs
[1:46:17] in other names i'm going to quote
[1:46:19] scripture now i'm reading a quote but
[1:46:21] i'm going to quote scripture
[1:46:22] joel i will pour out my spirit on only
[1:46:24] the men of the church
[1:46:26] i will pour out my spirit on only the
[1:46:28] fivefold ministry
[1:46:30] oh i will pour out my spirit on my sons
[1:46:33] and my daughters
[1:46:35] okay
[1:46:36] amen
[1:46:38] i'll take an anointing
[1:46:41] how about you sisters
[1:46:44] now keep those things in mind the church
[1:46:47] must believe
[1:46:49] every word
[1:46:52] every promise
[1:46:54] every iota
[1:46:57] and claim it
[1:46:59] for themselves
[1:47:04] my eyes are getting bad
[1:47:09] and exercise themselves in it
[1:47:14] well
[1:47:15] how do we exercise ourselves in though
[1:47:18] every word oh oh you mean you mean
[1:47:22] benjamin judah coming over here
[1:47:25] and loosening up his voice
[1:47:27] it's that little warm up judah
[1:47:29] we get a little bit ready
[1:47:32] how many have you ever been to a gym and
[1:47:33] know what it is to lift a weight
[1:47:35] how many you know what it is to go to
[1:47:36] gym class and skip a rope
[1:47:39] there's so much we do because some
[1:47:41] teacher in some school tells us to but
[1:47:43] boy bless god the preacher better not
[1:47:45] tell us how to praise
[1:47:50] all right daniel
[1:47:52] well
[1:47:52] turn the blade flat daniel turn the
[1:47:54] blade flat
[1:47:58] exercise themselves if i was engaged to
[1:48:01] a girl and i was a single man and i send
[1:48:04] her something
[1:48:05] an engagement ring and she wouldn't wear
[1:48:07] it then that shows she doesn't believe
[1:48:10] me now
[1:48:12] this ain't a pro-engagement ring quote
[1:48:14] no
[1:48:16] i just want to point that out because
[1:48:18] since i've been around just a couple
[1:48:20] weeks at my home church i've discovered
[1:48:22] that it's not our culture
[1:48:24] to give big old gaudy diamonds to girls
[1:48:27] to signify our love
[1:48:29] and you know brother force it just does
[1:48:31] my heart good because i see how that
[1:48:34] lines up with peter and paul's preaching
[1:48:37] and especially paul because paul said if
[1:48:41] i
[1:48:42] or an angel from heaven preach any other
[1:48:45] doctrine than what i've delivered unto
[1:48:48] you
[1:48:56] don't make me get the sword out
[1:49:00] because i know what to do with it
[1:49:04] i know it's weight i know it's balance
[1:49:07] and i know what it does and i knew what
[1:49:09] was going on last night
[1:49:14] the spirit of the prophet is subject to
[1:49:16] the prophet
[1:49:20] there was no accidents
[1:49:22] there were no mistakes to speak against
[1:49:24] the move of god is to blaspheme the holy
[1:49:26] spirit
[1:49:29] give a person grounds for divorce and do
[1:49:31] all kinds of things in a home if a
[1:49:33] person speaks against the man of god
[1:49:35] when he's delivering the word of god
[1:49:40] it's dangerous business
[1:49:44] it's not only sin to add to the word of
[1:49:46] god
[1:49:47] it is also sin to take from
[1:49:51] the word of god i don't have to scream
[1:49:54] at the top of my lungs unless he tells
[1:49:56] me to scream at the talk of my lungs but
[1:49:58] when he anoints me i'm going to do what
[1:50:00] he anoints me to do and if he puts a
[1:50:03] jump in my step like he does them
[1:50:05] kilimanjaros or however that is last
[1:50:08] night as i was up here dancing before
[1:50:10] the lord god told me i'm in all people
[1:50:12] daniel i'm in all people god does not
[1:50:15] recognize race like this poor white boy
[1:50:17] from arkansas
[1:50:19] preach a minute
[1:50:22] god does
[1:50:23] if he sees anything when he sees the
[1:50:25] color of our skin he sees the beautiful
[1:50:28] bouquet of his garden
[1:50:33] oh my
[1:50:35] thus dumb humans start comparing
[1:50:37] ourselves to other things and how much
[1:50:39] better we are and dumb americans oh i'm
[1:50:42] supposed to be sealing the deal
[1:50:45] dumb americans start going over and
[1:50:47] teaching people how to be americans
[1:50:51] our sisters in our churches post them
[1:50:53] big old gaudy engagement rings so that
[1:50:55] every other sister in the church tells
[1:50:57] their husband if you loved me you'd go
[1:50:59] spend four thousand dollars on me ring
[1:51:01] and as soon as that sister gets a four
[1:51:03] thousand dollar engagement ring that
[1:51:04] sister says she got one like that i want
[1:51:06] one that cost six thousand dollars
[1:51:09] and the only thing us guys can do is go
[1:51:11] buy an 80 000 truck and say look at me
[1:51:22] [Music]
[1:51:29] you're riding around you're sitting on
[1:51:30] eight ten thousand dollar diamond rings
[1:51:34] just like the world
[1:51:37] don't ask me what i paid for that stupid
[1:51:39] truck outside
[1:51:42] they've been calling every day since i
[1:51:43] got here
[1:51:45] they probably got a tracking device on
[1:51:47] it too they'll come get it if i don't
[1:51:48] pay them
[1:51:51] now keep these things oh well i got
[1:51:53] skipped i don't want to skip
[1:51:58] i'm going to let it sink in a little bit
[1:51:59] today the babies will sleep if i keep
[1:52:01] calm because we done stirred a bunch of
[1:52:03] things up
[1:52:05] if i was a single man i sent her
[1:52:06] something engagement ring and she
[1:52:08] wouldn't wear it that show she doesn't
[1:52:09] believe me
[1:52:10] she doesn't want to be my bride
[1:52:13] and if christ sends his church the gifts
[1:52:16] that he promised
[1:52:18] and they refused them and say they're
[1:52:20] not so
[1:52:22] they don't want to be the bride of
[1:52:24] christ
[1:52:26] they are espoused
[1:52:28] to some other lover
[1:52:31] and not to christ
[1:52:33] the bridegroom
[1:52:35] so the real church
[1:52:38] keeps the promise
[1:52:40] and keeps all
[1:52:43] and accepts the gifts
[1:52:46] god sends them
[1:52:49] all right
[1:52:51] now the first human beings
[1:52:53] disfellowshipped
[1:52:56] themselves from believing themselves
[1:52:59] from believing god by disbelieving his
[1:53:01] word and listening to a lie of the devil
[1:53:05] y'all wanna know what the lie was
[1:53:07] it's one word
[1:53:09] can you hear me
[1:53:11] it was one word
[1:53:13] god said you shall surely die
[1:53:16] and that snake in the grass that wasn't
[1:53:18] a snake in the grass yet
[1:53:19] it's one of god's freckles for this body
[1:53:21] of believers
[1:53:23] that beast was walking around why would
[1:53:26] god curse something
[1:53:28] to crawl on the ground that already
[1:53:29] crawled on the ground
[1:53:33] because it wasn't crawling on the ground
[1:53:36] that thing talked
[1:53:39] and the bible says that it beguiled eve
[1:53:43] you might take that back to your greek
[1:53:46] you're amplified
[1:53:49] that snake in the grass seduced eve
[1:53:53] and jesus had a little theological
[1:53:55] discussion
[1:53:57] with the scribes of his day because he
[1:53:59] told them you're of your father
[1:54:02] the devil
[1:54:08] and they knew serpent seed doctrine
[1:54:11] and they argued with him we be abraham's
[1:54:14] seed we're not cain's seed
[1:54:18] we're not of that he said we're of
[1:54:21] abraham and jesus said if you knew
[1:54:23] abraham you'd know me because before
[1:54:26] abraham was
[1:54:36] i'll let you in on a little bit of the
[1:54:38] clothes right now just to soothe you
[1:54:42] before abraham was
[1:54:44] you
[1:54:46] are
[1:54:56] now that's the first thing that
[1:54:57] disfellowshipped this wonderful union
[1:55:00] now look adam and eve in a position to
[1:55:02] never die
[1:55:04] in a position to never be old to never
[1:55:08] be sick
[1:55:09] to never have a worry
[1:55:11] you say i sure wish i could be like that
[1:55:14] let me i got news for you you are in the
[1:55:17] same position
[1:55:19] god places that to every creature on
[1:55:23] earth
[1:55:24] in the same position
[1:55:27] what was the agreement if you'll keep my
[1:55:31] words
[1:55:32] if my word if you'll keep it believe it
[1:55:35] and act upon it
[1:55:36] but the very first time that eve
[1:55:39] disbelieved took one word away from god
[1:55:43] said it broke off fellowship with that
[1:55:44] great union and the minute that the
[1:55:47] church disbelieves any one word of god's
[1:55:51] bible and places it somewhere else then
[1:55:54] they break off that wonderful fellowship
[1:55:56] that's offered to them
[1:55:59] and to be separated
[1:56:01] as soon as she did that death set in her
[1:56:05] mortal beings not only her mortal but
[1:56:08] her spiritual being
[1:56:09] she broke off relationship with god the
[1:56:12] minute she disbelieved
[1:56:15] and no man can believe here it is no man
[1:56:18] no
[1:56:19] woman
[1:56:19] can believe the devil's lie until they
[1:56:23] have disbelieved god's truth
[1:56:29] true
[1:56:31] no one can believe the devil's lie until
[1:56:35] they i just that's powerful this morning
[1:56:38] that's it
[1:56:40] one more little searing before we move
[1:56:42] to the final part of our meetings this
[1:56:44] weekend
[1:56:45] this is such a
[1:56:48] i want the body to know my wife and i
[1:56:51] are already in mourning at our departure
[1:56:53] tomorrow
[1:56:54] there is a melancholy that came over us
[1:56:56] last time i knew that if i didn't leave
[1:56:59] without having breakfast with my shelly
[1:57:01] family
[1:57:02] i would never leave
[1:57:05] i fell so in love with brother stephen
[1:57:08] and sister stacy on saturday my wife
[1:57:11] came to me
[1:57:12] and she couldn't tell me everything that
[1:57:14] god was doing for her she had to reserve
[1:57:17] because she knew the order of the body
[1:57:19] was for me to make a decision
[1:57:23] now i have to put some word out here
[1:57:26] this morning
[1:57:27] that is a little bit searing
[1:57:31] sisters if your husband calls you to the
[1:57:33] word of god
[1:57:36] hear me you must
[1:57:39] come in subjection to the word of god
[1:57:44] if your husband causes you to leave the
[1:57:47] word of god
[1:57:49] you must not
[1:57:52] you must stay with the word your first
[1:57:54] commitment yes christ told you to submit
[1:57:58] but not into worldliness
[1:58:00] not into carnality not into something
[1:58:03] contrary to his word
[1:58:10] how do you know
[1:58:13] that your conversation will not sanctify
[1:58:16] the man
[1:58:24] but if your husband's is fortified
[1:58:26] behind the word
[1:58:28] then stay
[1:58:29] behind yes
[1:58:36] huh
[1:58:38] i turned my page without reading my
[1:58:40] notes
[1:58:41] and i didn't number them 107.
[1:58:45] that's what it is
[1:58:47] it's to make you live brother brandon
[1:58:49] preached a sermon in 1959 in december i
[1:58:51] forgot to note where it was but it's
[1:58:53] what was the holy ghost given for
[1:58:56] such a simple title
[1:58:58] and he answers this question throughout
[1:58:59] the
[1:59:00] sermon and we've preached two days about
[1:59:04] getting back to our first love we've
[1:59:06] preached for two days about what the
[1:59:08] word will cause us to do
[1:59:10] and what will happen when we don't do
[1:59:12] that word
[1:59:14] brother branham said that's what it is
[1:59:16] it's to make you live
[1:59:18] a holy
[1:59:20] life
[1:59:21] that's what the holy ghost is powerful
[1:59:24] to set your affections on things above
[1:59:27] where god stands
[1:59:31] the mind of christ in you
[1:59:37] whose mind
[1:59:38] yes
[1:59:40] and who was christ
[1:59:43] all
[1:59:44] that god was
[1:59:47] so that fleshly tabernacle
[1:59:51] was god
[1:59:54] and the mind not the heart
[1:59:58] the mind that was in that body
[2:00:02] can be in you
[2:00:06] that's a freckle
[2:00:09] make you live a holy life that's what
[2:00:11] the holy ghost is power for
[2:00:14] the mind of christ you can't help from
[2:00:16] seeing those things when you look at
[2:00:18] them
[2:00:19] you turn your head men
[2:00:23] oh i added a word brother branham said
[2:00:25] you turn your head period that's right
[2:00:27] it's to make you
[2:00:29] the holy ghost is our strength man you
[2:00:31] want help around the house
[2:00:33] you want a more affectionate
[2:00:35] relationship with your wife
[2:00:38] quit stopping to ogle women
[2:00:42] get the holy ghost brother and knock it
[2:00:45] off
[2:00:50] jesus said i didn't come to do away with
[2:00:52] the law i come to magnify the law
[2:00:57] i come to magnify the law
[2:01:02] and if we're not careful
[2:01:04] he said that if man looks on a woman to
[2:01:06] lust after he's committed adultery
[2:01:09] and when
[2:01:10] jesus poured himself in that seventh
[2:01:12] church age messenger
[2:01:14] that's her closing scripture because god
[2:01:16] wants you to be a queen of heaven that's
[2:01:18] part of our clothes today he he wants
[2:01:20] you in this throne room with him and
[2:01:22] then he wants you manifesting to the
[2:01:23] earth
[2:01:25] but if we're not careful
[2:01:29] we don't take every word and apply it we
[2:01:31] don't take the mind of christ and get it
[2:01:33] in there
[2:01:34] and we just
[2:01:36] i'm sorry but guys you don't have to
[2:01:39] watch pornography
[2:01:41] to think the wrong thought
[2:01:46] i mean i don't know what line you cross
[2:01:49] but it's a sad day when preachers wives
[2:01:51] are posting on social media
[2:01:53] what their favorite tv shows are and
[2:01:55] they've got nudity and everything else
[2:01:57] in them but it ain't got to be nudity to
[2:01:59] be ungodly it's a sad day when we
[2:02:02] backslid to the point with that we have
[2:02:04] no conviction you say well you're just
[2:02:06] condemning me preacher really
[2:02:10] no i love you
[2:02:12] i don't want to pinch you as brother
[2:02:13] brahms fixing to say but this stings a
[2:02:16] little cause we're trying to cauterize
[2:02:17] that and show you all you've got to do
[2:02:19] to see if that spirit comes haunting you
[2:02:20] is give it the word test
[2:02:24] it's a word me and my daddy like we've
[2:02:25] used that a long time in our life
[2:02:28] that's what pulpits need in them it's
[2:02:31] what preachers need them and it's got to
[2:02:32] be both sides i'm fixing to read you the
[2:02:35] rest of this quote and brother brahm
[2:02:36] talks about what grace is
[2:02:38] yes
[2:02:39] it's going to shock you what grace is
[2:02:43] i'm sorry to tell you that but you just
[2:02:44] don't have as much revelation as you
[2:02:46] think you do you got lots and lots of
[2:02:48] education lots and lots of understanding
[2:02:52] lots and lots of head knowledge but when
[2:02:54] you get a revelation it changes the way
[2:02:56] you look at ministry it changes the way
[2:02:58] you look at gifts
[2:03:02] you say i can't do it oh i just can't do
[2:03:05] it brother braham says sure you can't
[2:03:12] but the holy spirit come for the purpose
[2:03:16] it come to take it out of you all of
[2:03:19] them old habits and things you're doing

[2:08:00] a while i jump off on the line somewhere
[2:08:02] staying with the truth
[2:08:04] but staying there and making it such a
[2:08:06] way it won't pinch you too hard
[2:08:10] but i want to tell you something
[2:08:14] and i'm going to quote a vindicated
[2:08:16] prophet and i'm going to do my best not
[2:08:18] to preach this
[2:08:19] i'm just going to quote william branham
[2:08:22] who my dad had the good fortune of
[2:08:24] understanding who he was although he was
[2:08:26] not there
[2:08:28] on the banks of the ohio river
[2:08:30] when brother branham was baptizing his
[2:08:33] 17th person and the same pillar of fire
[2:08:38] that
[2:08:39] would created a burning bush come down
[2:08:41] and hung in the heavens that day and
[2:08:43] many heard a thunder but a few heard the
[2:08:46] voice
[2:08:47] and they inscribed what that voice said
[2:08:49] i believe on brother branham's tombstone
[2:08:51] that voice said as your message
[2:08:54] or as john the baptist was sent to
[2:08:57] forerun the first coming of christ your
[2:09:00] message will forerun the second coming
[2:09:03] of christ
[2:09:04] you say what are you brother daniel i am
[2:09:07] a message believer i follow the message
[2:09:11] of the seventh church age messenger
[2:09:17] tell you something a little cute from my
[2:09:19] dad's ministry our young people will get
[2:09:21] this dad was teaching one time on the
[2:09:23] authority of that angel and what
[2:09:25] revelation 10 verse 7 says referring to
[2:09:28] revelation 3 14.
[2:09:32] dad says but
[2:09:34] in the days of the voice and that's a
[2:09:36] big butt
[2:09:42] because it's calling attention to a time
[2:09:46] when there would be a voice go out and
[2:09:48] say
[2:09:50] all the mysteries
[2:09:52] there would be a voice go out and say
[2:09:54] wrap up all the loose sins
[2:09:56] you say brother daniel are you telling
[2:09:58] me there's nothing you don't know
[2:10:01] no i'm telling you there's nothing he
[2:10:02] didn't know and i'm still learning
[2:10:05] i am not the vindicated prophet of this
[2:10:08] day i am just a preacher which is a
[2:10:10] prophet but not a major major prophet
[2:10:13] not a big deal prophet
[2:10:15] brother branham was a big deal prophet
[2:10:18] and there's all kinds of prophets jesus
[2:10:20] said they'll say lo he is here and lo he
[2:10:22] is there but don't do that but he said
[2:10:24] when a prophet comes and he says
[2:10:26] something in the name of the lord
[2:10:29] and he had it
[2:10:31] i hope i know what it is i hope i've got
[2:10:33] it all i can do is quote it and if i
[2:10:35] quote it i can say thus saith the lord
[2:10:37] when i'm quoting it
[2:10:39] but i got to be careful with that
[2:10:42] when i ain't quoting something if god
[2:10:44] sells something to me let me tell you
[2:10:45] what brother brown said about
[2:10:46] supernatural gifts and i know brother
[2:10:47] shelly knows as well as anybody but this
[2:10:49] is for my friends
[2:10:52] if you say something in the name of the
[2:10:53] lord and it don't come to pass your need
[2:10:54] to seek out somebody and get that lion
[2:10:57] devil prayed off of you because that
[2:10:58] ain't the spirit of christ
[2:11:01] now
[2:11:02] we had a beautiful thing i told my wife
[2:11:04] a few weeks ago one reason why my
[2:11:05] friends brother randy and sister lisa
[2:11:07] are sitting here is god did a miracle
[2:11:09] and i didn't want to talk about it while
[2:11:10] sister kaylee was here but she had to go
[2:11:11] home she's got a job and you guys
[2:11:13] remember her in prayer god's done a
[2:11:15] great work in her life and i know he
[2:11:17] wants to continue that
[2:11:19] but i told my wife we went into a little
[2:11:21] service things had lined up they said
[2:11:22] would you all come by the house and
[2:11:24] there's just this little candle fell in
[2:11:26] place and this domino fell and
[2:11:29] presence of the lord come and brother
[2:11:31] randy and i were ministering together
[2:11:33] his daughter maggie was sitting there
[2:11:35] and we were talking about how god before
[2:11:37] you were in your mother's womb god
[2:11:38] formed you and randy's molding his
[2:11:40] daughter's eyes and kaylee's sitting
[2:11:42] over here and and god is just showing me
[2:11:44] her and i'm not looking and i'm i'm not
[2:11:45] wanting to draw on her and i'm not
[2:11:46] wanting to touch her and i told the
[2:11:48] family they said we won't take you to
[2:11:50] dinner tomorrow night i said all right
[2:11:52] i said god wants to finish that work in
[2:11:54] kaylee's life that he started and then i
[2:11:56] told my wife oh kaylee wants to talk to
[2:11:59] her mom and dad about something heavy
[2:12:01] it's so heavy
[2:12:02] it's so hard to bear
[2:12:04] i don't know what it is but it needs to
[2:12:06] come out
[2:12:08] and god did a miracle that night
[2:12:10] it came out i watched lisa do one of the
[2:12:13] most beautiful things i've ever seen a
[2:12:14] mother do for a child in pain
[2:12:16] brother greeley
[2:12:18] in honor of you today if i'd had the
[2:12:20] opportunity i would have brought a tub
[2:12:22] and a towel and i would have washed your
[2:12:24] feet from these saints today
[2:12:27] i honor you today
[2:12:29] i know no greater way to serve god's man
[2:12:32] than to do what jesus commanded me to do
[2:12:34] and wash her feet
[2:12:36] but i watched sister lisa wash her
[2:12:38] daughter's feet and to tell her that she
[2:12:40] was clean by the
[2:12:41] repentance and the coming forth of the
[2:12:43] thing
[2:12:44] we stood there and i stood in our
[2:12:45] doorway and i said guys i'm out
[2:12:48] god did what he wanted to do i'm done
[2:12:52] but god wasn't done
[2:12:54] but all i know is the little things he
[2:12:56] shows me i don't know big picture for
[2:12:57] any of your life i can't tell you what
[2:12:59] you're supposed to do and where you're
[2:13:00] supposed to go but i can tell you i'm
[2:13:02] drinking a water i've never drunk so
[2:13:04] deep before
[2:13:06] i'm i'm becoming saturated with him and
[2:13:08] i know he wants to do more with me if i
[2:13:10] can get out of his way
[2:13:13] if i can get out of his way and stay out
[2:13:15] his way oh he's gonna do the greater
[2:13:17] works
[2:13:19] and he wants to do it in you
[2:13:22] it ain't about me it's about us we
[2:13:25] are the manifested sons and daughters of
[2:13:28] god
[2:13:31] but we must stay in line with that word
[2:13:33] for the moment we leave one word we
[2:13:36] leave our husband
[2:13:40] i want to tell you something
[2:13:42] if the bible says that it's wrong for a
[2:13:44] woman to cut her hair and you say you've
[2:13:47] got the holy ghost then cut your hair i
[2:13:50] wonder if you have
[2:13:53] don't get mad
[2:13:56] if it does that still shows there's
[2:13:58] another mark against you
[2:14:00] if the bible says it's wrong for a woman
[2:14:03] to put on a garment that pertained to a
[2:14:05] man and you wear these little overalls
[2:14:08] and slacks out here on the road you
[2:14:11] grown women
[2:14:13] guess a little baby would be
[2:14:15] play with the little boys and things but
[2:14:17] look when you're grown women 15 16 18
[2:14:22] years old up to grandma out here on the
[2:14:24] road and the bible said it's an
[2:14:27] abomination in the sight of god for a
[2:14:30] woman to wear those things and you wear
[2:14:32] them anyhow and you say you got the holy
[2:14:35] ghost
[2:14:37] i wonder sometime
[2:14:39] the holy ghost will follow
[2:14:42] god's word to
[2:14:45] the
[2:14:46] letter
[2:14:50] i'm sorry but i'm not
[2:14:54] i didn't say it
[2:14:59] i brought you some pictures
[2:15:01] everybody's got nice stuff to talk about
[2:15:03] if you want to know what the world
[2:15:05] thinks
[2:15:06] symbology
[2:15:08] for female and male are
[2:15:11] i will point you back
[2:15:16] to uh yeah
[2:15:17] a bathroom sign i've used it you have a
[2:15:21] perfect example
[2:15:26] that ain't a super person in a cape
[2:15:31] they didn't get that from some marvel or
[2:15:34] dc comic book
[2:15:38] it's modest apparel in the end time it's
[2:15:41] the end time signification of what a
[2:15:43] lady is supposed to be
[2:15:46] a few years ago when target started
[2:15:48] changing their rules on who could use
[2:15:50] what bathroom
[2:15:53] it became such a blow up and even my
[2:15:55] family and a few places
[2:15:57] got to
[2:15:58] modifying the sign a little bit
[2:16:01] this one says attention gentlemen
[2:16:04] it's got two women in dresses
[2:16:07] this is a women's restroom
[2:16:12] i found one
[2:16:14] oh i didn't get it downloaded i found
[2:16:16] one in a college
[2:16:17] and it showed the man and it showed the
[2:16:19] woman and it showed the handicapped
[2:16:21] chair and it said this is a transgender
[2:16:24] bathroom i hope they're not implying
[2:16:25] that anybody in a handicapped chair is a
[2:16:27] transgender all i could figure
[2:16:31] all i could figure they were implying
[2:16:32] that it doesn't matter how you dress to
[2:16:34] go in that bathroom
[2:16:36] and man how many charismatics and
[2:16:38] christians got all up in arms over men
[2:16:42] wearing dresses and going to the
[2:16:44] bathroom

[2:22:44] getting ready to lead us some in some
[2:22:46] worship i sure would appreciate i'll
[2:22:47] read a scripture and one more quote
[2:22:49] before we're done but bethany is going
[2:22:50] to share
[2:22:51] her testimony from last night if you
[2:22:53] need notes you get them i don't want you
[2:22:54] forget nothing
[2:22:57] so
[2:22:58] last night daddy was preaching about
[2:23:02] the different addictions that people
[2:23:04] have and the things that they feel are
[2:23:06] more important in their relationship
[2:23:08] with jesus and the things that they put
[2:23:09] before him and
[2:23:11] it got me thinking about some of the
[2:23:13] addictions that i have
[2:23:15] and the things that i would rather be
[2:23:17] doing than reading my bible or listening
[2:23:20] to a tape or even listening to a sermon
[2:23:24] just the things that i felt were more
[2:23:26] important
[2:23:27] and
[2:23:29] sister
[2:23:31] is it jaya or jaya
[2:23:34] sister jaya was singing that song last
[2:23:36] night and
[2:23:38] she's saying a lot the line the higher
[2:23:40] the need the higher i'll reach and
[2:23:43] i realized that i had a need but i
[2:23:45] didn't know what it was
[2:23:48] and i was standing there and i was just
[2:23:50] praying and i had both my hands raised
[2:23:52] and
[2:23:52] daddy was praying for people and i was
[2:23:54] like well he can't come stand by me he's
[2:23:56] doing his job and i was like maybe
[2:23:58] brother stephen would come and just hold
[2:24:00] my hand and just stand by me and
[2:24:04] he was there and he just took my hand
[2:24:06] and he started praying with me
[2:24:09] he said god you know her heart's desire
[2:24:11] and you know her thoughts
[2:24:13] he said i pray that you fulfill her
[2:24:15] heart's desire tonight and you give her
[2:24:17] her need
[2:24:19] and in that moment i realized what my
[2:24:21] need was and i desired to have him back
[2:24:25] and i knew that i needed him but i
[2:24:27] didn't know
[2:24:28] i didn't know how to get him back
[2:24:31] and i just stood there and i prayed and
[2:24:33] i asked
[2:24:35] and i asked that he would come back to
[2:24:37] me
[2:24:38] and i don't know exactly when
[2:24:41] or where i lost him along the way but
[2:24:44] brother stephen i know this is standing
[2:24:46] right there last night
[2:24:49] i got him back
[2:24:51] and i found him again
[2:24:54] and i'm so happy
[2:24:58] so much peace
[2:25:06] oh only god only god can do those things
[2:25:11] i'll give this if you've got your bibles
[2:25:14] and you'll stand for a scripture reading
[2:25:15] this afternoon just
[2:25:17] give us i don't know
[2:25:19] i've got one quote left it's a beautiful
[2:25:21] one what's so funny about this is i told
[2:25:24] my son-in-law i'm not going to tell this
[2:25:26] but i
[2:25:27] am i've already read all of this other
[2:25:29] and one of what i read it just ties
[2:25:31] right in
[2:25:34] because there is deliverance
[2:25:36] there is hope there is peace if you
[2:25:38] stand here this afternoon and like
[2:25:40] bethany there's a deep calling then
[2:25:42] there has to be a deep out there to
[2:25:44] respond david wrote of those things that
[2:25:46] the noise of thy water spouts oh god i
[2:25:49] want to be where the fountain is i want
[2:25:50] to be where the roar is i want a feast i
[2:25:52] want to drink i want to
[2:25:54] i want to thrive
[2:25:57] revelation chapter 1 i believe it is
[2:26:00] should have marked my bible
[2:26:03] hi john
[2:26:05] verse 9
[2:26:05] [Applause]
[2:26:07] not john who also am your brother and
[2:26:09] companion in tribulation and in the
[2:26:12] kingdom and patience of jesus christ
[2:26:20] i went too far
[2:26:25] john verse 4 i'm sorry
[2:26:28] skipped
[2:26:30] john to the seven churches which are in
[2:26:32] asia
[2:26:34] by the revealed word for our day
[2:26:38] we know that he was writing
[2:26:40] two letters that day
[2:26:43] he was writing to a literal place on a
[2:26:45] map
[2:26:47] and he was right into a disposition of
[2:26:49] time
[2:26:51] by the revealed word for our day we know
[2:26:53] that ephesus was the first church
[2:26:56] and it was the first church age
[2:27:00] and there's much you can study and
[2:27:01] there's much you can learn by the
[2:27:03] revealed word for our day
[2:27:05] but john said
[2:27:06] grace be unto you
[2:27:09] and peace if i can leave you with grace
[2:27:11] church yes did you hear what grace is
[2:27:15] some preachers don't have enough grace
[2:27:18] they don't have enough love to tell you
[2:27:21] the truth
[2:27:23] you better find somebody that loves you
[2:27:26] so much
[2:27:27] that they'll tell you the truth
[2:27:31] jesus christ who is the
[2:27:34] grace be unto you and peace from him
[2:27:36] which is and which was and which is to
[2:27:39] come
[2:27:40] and from the seven spirits which are
[2:27:42] before his throne
[2:27:44] and from jesus christ who is the
[2:27:46] faithful witness
[2:27:48] and the first begotten of the earth
[2:27:51] of the dead
[2:27:53] and the prince
[2:27:55] of the kings of the earth yes
[2:28:00] unto him that loved us and washed us
[2:28:02] from our sins
[2:28:03] in his own blood
[2:28:05] oh do you know you're clean today do you
[2:28:08] know that we preach the word of god and
[2:28:10] all you have to do is say
[2:28:13] i
[2:28:13] repent
[2:28:17] that's it it only takes a moment's time
[2:28:19] in his presence when i watch that
[2:28:21] witness of a mother's love and the
[2:28:23] bathing of those feet
[2:28:25] and i was reminded of mary magdalene
[2:28:28] crawling her way into that preacher's
[2:28:30] house
[2:28:32] that didn't love jesus enough to make
[2:28:34] sure the foot wash guy was at his post
[2:28:39] you may be seated just a moment before
[2:28:41] the worshipers come
[2:28:47] mary magdalene had heard that this man
[2:28:50] that had perhaps stood at the well that
[2:28:53] day and had
[2:28:54] told that lady every sin she had ever
[2:28:56] committed
[2:28:58] she had heard that that man was coming
[2:29:01] to her town i'm assuming it was mary
[2:29:02] magdalene i don't actually remember
[2:29:05] just a mary
[2:29:07] of mary's in the new testament
[2:29:09] but she heard that jesus she smelled the
[2:29:11] cooking
[2:29:13] she knew they were throwing a party at
[2:29:14] simon's house
[2:29:16] and she knew jesus was going to be
[2:29:18] because jesus
[2:29:19] keeps his
[2:29:20] appointments and he goes where he's
[2:29:22] invited
[2:29:25] he and he stays where he's made welcome
[2:29:28] he stays where he's made well
[2:29:33] but she thought you know maybe this is
[2:29:35] what i've been waiting for maybe this is
[2:29:36] my opportunity i've been
[2:29:39] selling myself
[2:29:41] i've been giving myself to this world
[2:29:44] trying to get enough save that i can
[2:29:46] start a business or get out of this line
[2:29:48] of work i'm so embarrassed and i'm so
[2:29:50] ashamed but all i've got but if i could
[2:29:53] get to him perhaps that would make a
[2:29:55] difference
[2:29:57] and she took her little stash brother
[2:29:59] branham tells the story so eloquently
[2:30:01] she takes her little stash out from
[2:30:03] behind a hidden place in her house or
[2:30:05] whatever and she goes down and she buys
[2:30:08] the most expensive
[2:30:10] brother benjamin i'd like to start with
[2:30:12] that i'll lavish my and then we'll go
[2:30:15] from there whatever the holy spirit
[2:30:16] leads i don't want us to get stuck on
[2:30:19] anything
[2:30:21] she thought if i can just get to him
[2:30:25] and jesus had come to this party at this
[2:30:27] big preacher's house
[2:30:29] the preacher was just waiting for an
[2:30:31] opportunity to make fun of him he was
[2:30:33] just waiting he runs with the rabble of
[2:30:36] the earth he's a renegade
[2:30:40] he hangs out with these ill-famed women
[2:30:42] and these guys that don't practice the
[2:30:44] law right and they don't honor the
[2:30:46] priest and
[2:30:47] no they were picking at him
[2:30:50] but she just wanted to be wherever he
[2:30:52] was cause she had heard she had heard
[2:30:55] maybe you've heard the word of god this
[2:30:57] week and you wonder i wonder if i can
[2:30:59] just get to his feet today
[2:31:01] i wonder if i can just crawl up and
[2:31:03] touch him i won't look him in the eye i
[2:31:05] won't i'm ashamed but i just get to his
[2:31:08] feet
[2:31:12] not only did she get to his feet i
[2:31:14] imagine brother shelly he didn't twitch
[2:31:18] i imagine he knew that if he moved a
[2:31:20] finger it would scare her
[2:31:24] and i don't know if she unclasped his
[2:31:26] sandals or not but i kind of think she
[2:31:29] did
[2:31:31] and maybe her hair was
[2:31:34] excuse me maybe it was pinned back but i
[2:31:37] i think she was crying so much
[2:31:40] that she didn't need water
[2:31:43] and jesus just sat there and let that
[2:31:45] ill-famed women
[2:31:47] wash
[2:31:49] woman excuse me wash and kiss his feet
[2:31:57] and then
[2:31:58] she began to wipe
[2:32:00] his feet off with her long hair
[2:32:03] she began to get all muddy and messy i
[2:32:06] can only imagine
[2:32:08] she
[2:32:22] oh
[2:32:25] she lavished and she took the most
[2:32:28] expensive box of oil that she could
[2:32:31] afford and she poured it on him
[2:32:35] and she began to lavish the christ with
[2:32:39] her love
[2:32:42] so true
[2:32:44] and as
[2:32:46] she poured everything she had of this
[2:32:48] world
[2:32:49] all of her savings all of her plans
[2:32:53] all of her desires she began to pour it
[2:32:56] on him
[2:32:59] that gentle
[2:33:01] kind
[2:33:02] jesus
[2:33:03] began to do war for that little lady
[2:33:08] and his skirts
[2:33:10] covered her oh brother ben when we start
[2:33:12] to worship i want his train to fill his
[2:33:14] temple yes
[2:33:15] i want his skirt to feel i wanted to

[2:33:30] [Music]
[2:33:32] john wrote and he said
[2:33:39] from jesus christ who is the faithful
[2:33:41] witness and the first begotten of the
[2:33:43] dead and the prince of the kings of the
[2:33:44] earth unto him that loved us and washed
[2:33:46] us from our sins in his own blood and
[2:33:50] verse 6 if you would
[2:33:52] of chapter 1 of the book of revelation
[2:33:54] the apocalypse the end he hath made us
[2:33:57] kings and priests
[2:33:59] unto god
[2:34:00] and his father to him be glory and
[2:34:04] dominion forever and ever we found my
[2:34:07] wife and i as we begin to study the word
[2:34:09] of god together over the last few years
[2:34:10] we find that the word of god often
[2:34:12] refers to the male factor especially
[2:34:14] from the translation from the king james
[2:34:16] era that sometimes
[2:34:20] sometimes they lean towards that giving
[2:34:22] honor in reference to the king of that
[2:34:24] time king james and so as we begin to
[2:34:26] study these scriptures and break them
[2:34:27] down we find out that god didn't just
[2:34:30] bless men
[2:34:32] and i didn't get another translation
[2:34:34] ready for this i'm just sharing this
[2:34:35] with you under inspiration because
[2:34:38] my dear sisters
[2:34:41] the word of god for the day and hour in
[2:34:42] which we say uh live says it's the word
[2:34:46] living
[2:34:50] think about this living word jesus was
[2:34:53] the messiah brother branham often
[2:34:55] referred to us as messiah ets
[2:34:58] he referred to you as mrs jesus christ
[2:35:02] you are the bride
[2:35:03] of the king of heaven i believe my
[2:35:06] friend knows that god refers to us as
[2:35:09] his beloved
[2:35:13] if they'd have only looked he was
[2:35:17] messiah
[2:35:19] he was the living word made manifest
[2:35:23] and a man
[2:35:25] that's got the spirit of god in him
[2:35:28] or
[2:35:29] a woman
[2:35:32] lives that word right lives
[2:35:35] right out in them
[2:35:38] that's the heartbeat
[2:35:42] [Music]
[2:35:45] the predestinated for the word of the
[2:35:47] lord comes to them
[2:35:49] [Music]
[2:35:51] they are the word
[2:35:53] to the people
[2:35:55] written epistles
[2:35:58] you
[2:36:00] my children my friends my family this
[2:36:02] church
[2:36:03] we are the word of god made manifest in
[2:36:09] 2022.
[2:36:15] i preached several weeks ago when i was
[2:36:18] here
[2:36:19] jesus told his disciples
[2:36:22] have i been so long with you
[2:36:25] and you didn't know me
[2:36:27] as brother shelley ministered so long to
[2:36:29] us
[2:36:32] has our pastor become common
[2:36:37] has the presence of the lord departed
[2:36:39] from him
[2:36:40] has the glory of the lord
[2:36:42] lost its glow to us
[2:36:45] do we honor and reference the gift
[2:36:49] do we see jesus in the man of god
[2:36:53] do we see jesus when we get up in the
[2:36:55] morning to go to work tomorrow
[2:36:57] do we make sure jesus is there
[2:37:01] do we leave for work and we say oh jesus
[2:37:04] i see you
[2:37:07] please
[2:37:09] touch someone with me today
[2:37:12] i believe sister flo under inspiration
[2:37:14] of the holy spirit told my
[2:37:16] son-in-law i am jealous of you
[2:37:19] hallelujah
[2:37:22] i believe jealousy jesus
[2:37:25] stands on that other side of this
[2:37:28] dimension
[2:37:29] and he's jealous of any of us
[2:37:31] that gets to touch his children i
[2:37:33] believe he's jealous of any of us that
[2:37:36] gets to bless his children
[2:37:38] oh yes i believe he is jealous because
[2:37:42] you get to be his hands sister i got to
[2:37:46] tell you
[2:37:47] i hope my kids know why the organ now is
[2:37:50] my favorite instrument
[2:37:52] you took me someplace when you were
[2:37:54] playing that organ it has always spoke
[2:37:56] to me but today
[2:37:58] today i got to hear it once again like i
[2:38:01] remember hearing it when i was a child
[2:38:03] it took me some place into the ramparts
[2:38:06] of glory and it spoke to me
[2:38:09] and for a moment i felt the skirt of his
[2:38:13] robe passed by thank you lord it will
[2:38:17] and if you'll spend just a few minutes
[2:38:19] before you go out to eat maybe a few
[2:38:21] minutes before brother forrest tells you
[2:38:24] a testimony or my mom or brother shelly
[2:38:26] if you'll spend just a few more minutes
[2:38:29] and let his robe pass by his robes will
[2:38:33] touch you he will take a tong off the al
[2:38:36] from and grab fire off the altar and you
[2:38:38] can go out here as a servant of the lord
[2:38:41] man or woman he can cleanse you today
[2:38:44] you can get filled up with the holy
[2:38:47] ghost you can get faith
[2:38:49] you can get virtue you can get
[2:38:51] temperance you can get patience you can
[2:38:54] get godliness you can get that brotherly
[2:38:56] kindness and god can put the seal
[2:38:59] of the holy ghost the love of god on
[2:39:01] your life that when you touch people you
[2:39:04] will change their life
[2:39:09] and if you ever start to air if you ever
[2:39:12] start to falter if like oh brother
[2:39:15] joshua when he began to take city after
[2:39:18] city he found himself in trouble because
[2:39:21] one day 16 men died
[2:39:24] and joshua had been told that he would
[2:39:27] not lose one man and he went and he told
[2:39:30] god what's going on why are we failing
[2:39:33] why are we slipping and god said there's
[2:39:36] sin in the camp
[2:39:39] somebody has done contrary to what i
[2:39:42] said you wonder why our families are in
[2:39:45] disarray you wonder why our marriages
[2:39:48] are falling apart we must
[2:39:51] we must
[2:39:53] fill back the tent
[2:39:55] get the babylonian gold
[2:39:58] out of our homes
[2:40:00] out of our lives so that we can be so
[2:40:04] full of the holy ghost
[2:40:07] that as we begin to lavish
[2:40:10] he's not embarrassed by our worship he's
[2:40:12] not embarrassed by our praise but that
[2:40:15] he
[2:40:16] comes up as a sweet smelling savor to
[2:40:20] him
[2:40:21] that's right and he comes walking
[2:40:23] through our midst
[2:40:25] and his robe touches us

[3:02:07] i was alone
[3:02:09] alone
[3:02:10] and wasn't sure exactly what to do
[3:02:13] because i was losing people left and
[3:02:15] right
[3:02:17] and one day the phone rang
[3:02:20] and it was brother henry simmons
[3:02:22] and he said now you don't know me
[3:02:24] but i've heard some good things about
[3:02:26] you and what god has showed you
[3:02:29] and he said me and another brother we're
[3:02:31] going to ride down
[3:02:32] and spend the day with you
[3:02:34] and it was brother henry simmons and
[3:02:36] brother isaiah brooks
[3:02:38] so i appreciated their friendship
[3:02:41] and them coming to stand by me and help
[3:02:43] me
[3:02:44] to prepare myself
[3:02:47] that i would probably lose everybody
[3:02:51] and then god would start adding them
[3:02:53] back
[3:02:54] those that were hungry for the word
[3:02:57] and he was faithful
[3:02:58] he's keeping us all in his care isn't he
[3:03:01] so would you stand
[3:03:03] we want to just
[3:03:07] just again remember
[3:03:10] our brother and ask that god would renew
[3:03:12] his strength
[3:03:14] and bless him
[3:03:16] what an honor to have his friends so
[3:03:18] many of his friends with us and family
