TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] we call revelation the last book of the Bible the book of symbols because God gave John caught him up in the spirit where there is no time and in the spirit he could see eternity in both directions that's powerful and he was given symbols of things that were happening in his present time that he didn't know anything about understand and he was shown symbols that would continue to represent God's plan for man all the way up to the last age john living in the first church age and yet God let him see symbols that would represent God's great plan for mankind all the way through seven Church ages all the way up to the last of the last days and all of that was available to John because he yielded to an invitation come up come on I love that you know I don't really believe that dimensions are stacked on top of one another and realms on top of one another even though it's described this way and symbol in the Bible we first have in second heaven third heaven but I understand that more likely these things are running parallel is that too too strange for you and really in other words John could have just stepped into another realm had God opened the veil and that's what he was trying to do but I love the terminology come up and what that says to me is you got to get up above all the weights all the problems all the heartaches all the baggage of your present lot John could have really you know he could have been feeling sorry for himself I mean after surviving those other attempts on his life he's banished to Pat and they fully believed that he would die many believe they were wild beasts on that island and that prisoners had been sit there and I think there's even history that says that that new prisoners had been banished there and killed by old prisoners that they thought had already died but had somehow survived a little longer in caves and whatever else and so really there were so many unknowns to the Isle of Patmos at that time I guess John could have really said lord have you forgotten me you let me live to to have me thrown out here in the wilderness but I'm so glad that John was able to get up above his present aches and pains and feelings of rejection if indeed he had any feeling like God had forsaken him he was able to push through all the stuff the muck and the mire to heed a call come up higher John I'm giving you an invitation to another realm to another dimension where all things are possible God is a supernatural God his desire is to release in his people supernatural life it's more than just eternal life it's a doorway into a realm I want to say it again where all things are possible come go with me on this journey of faith I'm not going to fool around with you and I'm not going to tell you that this Christian journey is all mountaintops and you know babbling brooks and sunny days there's going to be rainy days there's going to be foggy days there's going to be painful days tearful days but all I want you to know that you don't ever have to feel hopeless when you know Jesus Christ because in one minute he can take a hopeless situation and turn it completely around and I believe we can discover more possibility and more potential and more strategy by spending more time reaching for that unseen that spiritual realm that supernatural realm that that realm is a realm of reality it's a realm of power a realm of holiness and purity it's a realm of beauty it's a realm where God speaks to us oh yes I know the mainstream media loves to make fun of those who believe God talks to them you really they'll they'll ask like it you really but you really heard God speak to you they love to portray and paint people like that to believe they hear from God like they need a ward somewhere in a mental in a mental facility like they've all just lost their mind and they'll they'll never get it back they love to laugh and make fun but I want to tell you that according to the scripture if you're born again by the Spirit of God you should be able to hear the inner voice of God speaking to you not a chosen few not only those who might find themselves in office of apostle or profit but believer a Holy Spirit Holy Ghost filled born-again believer you have the promise of that deep knowing that comes from the voice of God it's more often that he speaks with an inner voice unknowing and I think it's that way on purpose I think that it teaches us maturity because we have to wait and discern and judge we have to take what that inner voice says and compare it with God's written authority the word and we have to make sure that this is not our soul our emotions our own mind but that God is really confirming something to us with an inner power with an inner voice oh my I hope that I hope that doesn't sound too strange the Bible tells us we will know that we are saved because there will be an inner quickening a making alive of our own spirit oh yes brother sister you can know that you're ready to meet God that that old hymn of the church blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of glory divine because we are the heirs of salvation we have every right to claim that leadership of the Holy Spirit from the inside in order to be able to recognize that identify that and find grace to obey that leadership we're going to have to heed the invitation of the Lord come up come up a little higher step out of your present thought pattern and reality get out of your paradigm the the old humdrum of the usual and let me show you something bigger than what your mind would even be able to comprehend and so God doesn't deal with us from the supernatural realm in our mind he does that in our deep spirit a human spirit that has been regenerated by the breath of God I tell you it's powerful when we look scripturally with eyes that have been anointed with eyesalve for revelation when we look at just what it means to be born from heaven to be born again let me read here of a portion of Scripture in 2nd Peter chapter 1 verses 17 through 19 for he received from God the Father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard we heard this is Peter being a witness we heard this voice and when we were with him in the holy mount verse 19 we have also a more sure word of prophecy where until you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shine a--the in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts you and I were not physical witnesses to the ministry to the glory and the Transfiguration of the Lord Jesus Christ that day on the mountain but Peter was and he said we heard the voice now that proves to me right there that God can speak in an audible voice that more than one person can hear but I love what Peter said he wanted people not to Marvel or to be just you know enamored by the fact that he had heard the physical voice of God but he said but we have also a more sure word of prophecy where until you do well to take heed as unto a light that shine if in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts I want you to know that if even if you should never hear an audible voice of God if you're born again of the Spirit a day star has risen your heart the light of Jesus Christ has penetrated the darkness and the sin and the unbelief that once crowded your heart and he has come to be king of all and Lord of all Lord over every circumstance over every disease over all bondage all darkness every knee I'm telling you there's there's an hour ahead where the scripture said every knee will bow wouldn't you want to be there in that moment when even Lucifer the fallen angel hasatan Satan we refer to him or the devil some people say he embodies all that is evil and was so created for a purpose and yet one day that old slewfoot he's been called will have to bow his knee and publicly declare in the presence of those who have been delivered from his hand and in the presence of those fooled deceived blinded by his plan he will have to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord of all to the glory of the Father can you imagine what that would be like if you were fooled by the devil seduced by the devil and then later you have to sit there and listen to him declare that the very thing he talked you out of is now the very thing that he believes that Jesus is Lord of all but that day is coming it's coming as sure as we are gathered here today it is coming and there's a safe place to be and that is in the Lord Jesus Christ I want you to know that he's real thank you for watching today
