[0:00] i want to tell you this morning under
[0:02] the inspiration of the holy spirit that
[0:04] you're not even really believing for the
[0:06] fullness of what he has because he
[0:08] hasn't even let you know the whole
[0:14] [Music]
[0:16] we're eagles
[0:20] let's soar out of
[0:25] [Music]
[0:27] you're you're talking like
[0:29] i can just do it
[0:36] at will i can just
[0:38] get above it
[0:41] you're understanding me
[0:44] you're not misunderstanding me
[0:46] you are understanding me
[0:49] because we know that our atmosphere is
[0:52] controlled by our mindset
[0:56] if you've got a mindset for the valley
[0:59] the valley is where you're going to peck
[1:01] around
[1:03] if you've got a mindset just to get
[1:05] above the heads of somebody else that's
[1:07] about how high you'll fly
[1:09] you'll look around and say well at least
[1:11] i'm better off than he is
[1:14] you know that's not your goal just to
[1:16] get up a little above somebody in your
[1:18] family
[1:19] or somebody in your church
[1:21] you've got something more of pulling on
[1:23] you than to just get up above a little
[1:26] circumstance you've got a whole heaven
[1:29] out there that's calling you to higher
[1:32] heights
[1:33] to new dimensions
[1:36] to new realms of the spirit that you and
[1:39] i have only
[1:40] pecked into
[1:42] tapped into
[1:44] we're called to be immersed in those
[1:46] things
[1:47] not just taste them like appetizers
[1:50] in a meal but we are to feast on the
[1:52] hope and the promise that god has given
[1:54] us i've got some things for you that
[1:56] you've never walked in and you've never
[1:58] known and you've never understood so
[2:01] many around this message put everything
[2:03] in the past but i noticed the prophet
[2:06] never put anything in the past he had a
[2:08] tendency to call even the future into
[2:11] the present
[2:14] he'd look out there and see what god was
[2:16] going to do and then he'd say he's doing
[2:18] it
[2:20] where is somebody going to take that
[2:22] kind of an example today and look out
[2:25] there at what god is going to do and
[2:27] what he's promised to do and raise up
[2:29] and say he's doing it
[2:32] somebody said well i'm not experiencing
[2:35] that just because you and i are not
[2:37] experiencing that doesn't mean that it's
[2:40] not true doesn't mean that god's not
[2:43] doing it somewhere for those who believe
[2:47] so i encourage you dare to believe
[2:51] to take god at his word i want you to
[2:54] know hope's a powerful force it takes
[2:57] more than hope to get the job done but
[2:59] hope will keep you pointed in the right
[3:00] direction until your faith can be
[3:02] anointed the enemy wants you hopeless
[3:06] the enemy wants you to feel bankrupt
[3:09] and helpless and that there's no way out
[3:12] of the situation that you're in right
[3:14] now but i want you to know there is and
[3:18] even greater
[3:20] some of you that are believing god for
[3:21] great promises in your life i want to
[3:23] tell you this morning under the
[3:25] inspiration of the holy spirit that
[3:27] you're not even really believing for the
[3:29] fullness of what he has because he
[3:31] hasn't even let you know the whole what
[3:33] we're operating on now is just what he
[3:35] lets us get a hold of a glimpse here and
[3:38] there but the half has never yet been
[3:41] told of what god desires to do in you
[3:45] through you
[3:47] a harvest will follow
[3:49] a quick short work
[3:51] and then a rapture
[3:54] hallelujah then you can ask one another
[3:57] how do i look leave in this world
[3:59] [Music]
