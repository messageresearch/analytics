[1:02:50] mad you can stay home wear a mask and
[1:02:52] live in a bubble and do all those kind
[1:02:54] of things if you like but but you'll get

[1:11:59] Proverbs if you need to slip out before
[1:12:03] we're finish this morning we certainly
[1:12:05] understand we're going to give God the
[1:12:07] time that he needs this morning leaning
[1:12:10] on him depending on him and needing him
[1:12:13] amen sister Audrey sent a message also
[1:12:17] in tremendous pain today and needs a
[1:12:19] healing touch from the Lord may God just
[1:12:23] reach down to her
[1:12:25] and she's sometimes unable to get up and
[1:12:27] walk around she has been in a real
[1:12:30] battle but we know that her hope and
[1:12:33] trust is in the Lord and I didn't
[1:12:35] mention brother Shaw and sister Ronda
[1:12:37] they've also been fighting for their
[1:12:39] health but we just believe that very
[1:12:42] quickly God will restore them amen I
[1:12:45] didn't have time to I'm so sorry I just
[1:12:47] got a little distracted this morning but
[1:12:50] uh there are some birthdays this week
[1:12:52] and I may miss one but the ones I have
[1:12:54] I'll call them out real quick sister
[1:12:56] Cindy has a birthday on Friday do you
[1:12:59] still celebrate birthday sister Cindy

[1:13:08] Cindy I know what Emily wants for her

[1:13:12] family well so let's pray that God will
[1:13:15] give her that and we send our love and
[1:13:18] uh happy birthday greetings to sister
[1:13:20] Emily also on Friday Friday Also begins
[1:13:23] purum and uh the reality of purum is
[1:13:27] still alive today there's still a mighty
[1:13:29] force that would like to take out God's
[1:13:31] people but they
[1:13:34] can't God has an Covenant he has an
[1:13:36] eternal Covenant with his people he's
[1:13:39] faithful to that Covenant and we pray
[1:13:42] for Israel not just when we uh when we
[1:13:45] remember something coming up like a
[1:13:47] purum but we pray every day the
[1:13:49] scripture tells us there's a blessing in
[1:13:51] praying for the Peace of Jerusalem and
[1:13:53] for the Jewish people people wherever
[1:13:55] they are and it's time for them to go
[1:13:57] home it's time for them to go home and
[1:14:00] take the promise and we're so thankful
[1:14:02] For What the Lord Has Done and the
[1:14:04] restoration that he has brought we're
[1:14:06] thankful every year around purum time we
[1:14:09] remember that God had a had a little
[1:14:12] woman at the right place at the right
[1:14:15] time the scripture said for such a time
[1:14:17] as this and uh he's got an answer for
[1:14:20] every
[1:14:22] hmon he knows how he knows how to deal
[1:14:24] with with every hmon you believe that
[1:14:27] God's got a
[1:14:29] morai he's got a faithful servant
[1:14:32] sitting by the gate waiting on God to
[1:14:34] keep his promise and he
[1:14:37] will so if you happen to be like us and
[1:14:41] porum is a time of of remembering and
[1:14:44] sometimes we do the groggers and
[1:14:46] sometimes we well almost all the time we
[1:14:48] eat
[1:14:49] hamash because there's enough jewishness
[1:14:51] in us that we understand the principle
[1:14:54] of the Jew they tried to kill us God
[1:14:56] wouldn't let them he gave us the victory
[1:14:58] let's
[1:15:00] eat that's Judaism they'll tell you
[1:15:03] right away that's that's been their
[1:15:04] their existence but one of these days
[1:15:07] it's not going to be quite like that
[1:15:10] amen um and then on Saturday the 15th
[1:15:14] the next day is David's birthday he's
[1:15:15] out one of the musicians but uh we wish
[1:15:19] him a very happy birthday as well did I
[1:15:21] miss someone here that you just call it
[1:15:23] out and tell on me
[1:15:25] all right let's turn to Proverbs um I I
[1:15:30] uh we we're in a in a study it's a
[1:15:33] little bit awkward sometime when we're
[1:15:36] in a study because there's that great
[1:15:38] temptation to want to go back and and
[1:15:41] rehearse and Rewind and go over what
[1:15:45] we've already gone over but there's
[1:15:47] really no time for that so if you are
[1:15:49] not uh a part of the series thus far
[1:15:52] it's available on the app and um we're
[1:15:55] thankful that God is giving victory over
[1:15:57] the spirit of
[1:15:58] offense amen he is yes his people have
[1:16:02] carried it too long and we're ready to
[1:16:05] be completely delivered set free healed
[1:16:07] and whole great peace have they which
[1:16:10] love the law of God and nothing shall by
[1:16:12] any means offend them we want to have an
[1:16:14] unoffendable heart I want to have an
[1:16:17] unoffendable heart in this battle amen
[1:16:20] I've got to win this thing and we have
[1:16:22] been identifying that there are spirits
[1:16:25] that like to partner with offense the
[1:16:27] first being anger we've dealt with anger
[1:16:29] and now we're in the third session of
[1:16:31] dealing with pride and when you ask
[1:16:34] Christian people about Pride nobody has
[1:16:36] any nobody you know we're we're
[1:16:39] Believers uh but then when you start
[1:16:41] looking at what Pride does and how it
[1:16:43] behaves you find out that there are
[1:16:46] remnants and and residues of Pride
[1:16:50] clinging even to the believer's life and
[1:16:53] and we've got to not put on a false
[1:16:55] humility but a real one a genuine one we
[1:16:58] cloak ourselves in humility God will use
[1:17:01] us and he'll give us what we need in our
[1:17:03] families and in our lives do you believe
[1:17:05] that okay brace yourself then Proverbs
[1:17:08] Chapter 6 beginning in verse
[1:17:12] 16 pray for me would you these six
[1:17:16] things doth the Lord
[1:17:18] hate yay seven are an Abomination unto
[1:17:24] him a proud look a lying tongue and
[1:17:29] hands that shed innocent blood an heart
[1:17:34] that deviseth Wicked
[1:17:36] imaginations feet that be Swift in
[1:17:40] running to Mischief a false witness that
[1:17:44] speaketh lies and he that Seth
[1:17:50] Discord among Brethren I want us to look
[1:17:53] at one verse in the Amplified before you
[1:17:56] have your seat and that's verse
[1:17:58] 17 it says a proud look this the spirit
[1:18:03] that makes one
[1:18:06] overestimate
[1:18:08] himself
[1:18:10] and
[1:18:12] underestimate
[1:18:14] others that's that's the bottom
[1:18:17] line um when you see your life as the
[1:18:21] most
[1:18:22] important there is at least at least a
[1:18:25] remnant of the spirit of Pride that's
[1:18:27] still hanging on to your life and we
[1:18:30] don't want that now we know we have to
[1:18:32] take care of ourselves we take care of
[1:18:34] our families we we we clean up you know
[1:18:37] we want to look as good as we can and
[1:18:40] the these that's not what we're talking
[1:18:41] about here we're talking about putting
[1:18:44] others down and lifting ourselves up all
[1:18:48] the time we're we're also talking about
[1:18:51] losing patience with people who don't
[1:18:53] see the importance of us
[1:18:58] we we uh sometimes think that we're all
[1:19:00] that and we get aggravated with people
[1:19:02] who don't see us is all that all right
[1:19:05] now are you going to help me this
[1:19:08] morning the Amplified said a proud look
[1:19:11] the spirit that makes one overestimate
[1:19:13] himself and underestimate others a lying
[1:19:17] tongue and hands that shed innnocent
[1:19:19] blood Papa we need you ABA we come
[1:19:23] before you today today knowing that we
[1:19:26] are nothing without you but with you we
[1:19:29] are everything you said we were to be
[1:19:32] everything that we were created to be
[1:19:34] everything that you saw us being before
[1:19:38] the foundation of the world your
[1:19:41] thoughts about us did not start at our
[1:19:45] physical birth on planet Earth but our
[1:19:49] we were in your mind before the world's
[1:19:52] foundations were laid
[1:19:55] if I believe what the scripture said and
[1:19:57] I do we you knew us you knew our
[1:19:59] uprisings and our
[1:20:02] downfalls you already knew our strengths
[1:20:04] and Witnesses and if I believe what Paul
[1:20:07] said in the New Testament you already
[1:20:09] even knew my
[1:20:11] choice I had one to make but in your
[1:20:15] forn knowledge you knew my choice before
[1:20:18] I was ever born and because of that you
[1:20:22] have shielded Our Lives it's not that we
[1:20:25] haven't been through some stuff we have
[1:20:28] and there have been some suffering a
[1:20:30] little bit of pain along the way but the
[1:20:32] reality is all of these things pale in
[1:20:36] comparison to the brightness of your
[1:20:38] glory that is being revealed in the sons
[1:20:41] of God in these last days we are not
[1:20:45] what we desire to be but we give you the
[1:20:48] praise for not being what we once were
[1:20:51] we thank you for every deliverance we
[1:20:53] thank you for every time that you have
[1:20:57] dug out the root every time that you
[1:21:00] have let your word uncover what we were
[1:21:03] not even totally completely aware of and
[1:21:07] thank you for the grace that did not
[1:21:09] condemn us but the grace that pulled us
[1:21:12] higher and so today Lord once again we
[1:21:15] feel the upward call the upward pull
[1:21:19] back into who you have created us to be
[1:21:22] and we must confess that sometimes it's
[1:21:25] a painful Journey dealing with the
[1:21:28] reality uh of what we have allowed to
[1:21:32] remain in us but we trust the process
[1:21:35] because we trust you and we know that
[1:21:38] you are indeed working all things not
[1:21:41] some of the things not the things we
[1:21:43] like but all things you're using them
[1:21:48] for your glory to be established and
[1:21:50] revealed in us all things work together
[1:21:53] for the good
[1:21:55] of them who love the Lord them who are
[1:21:57] the called according to his purpose so
[1:22:00] we bless you in all things and we ask
[1:22:02] for your strength and help as we
[1:22:04] approach your word bashim Adonai Yeshua
[1:22:06] hamashiach in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:09] Christ we pray and the Saints said you
[1:22:12] may be
[1:22:13] seated I want you to look with me at the
[1:22:16] Hebrew word that is used there in verse
[1:22:21] 17 uh the word is remote
[1:22:25] it is both an ancient Hebrew word and a
[1:22:28] modern Hebrew
[1:22:30] word uh modern Hebrew we would usually
[1:22:33] pronounce it
[1:22:34] raamat and uh in ancient Hebrew perhaps
[1:22:39] more with an o sound remote it if you
[1:22:42] are ever in Israel you will see so many
[1:22:46] signs that use the word Ramat and it's
[1:22:50] because many things in the land of
[1:22:53] Israel are named after high places high
[1:22:55] mountains or high hills and there it
[1:23:00] will be uh a
[1:23:02] prefix part of the name but also
[1:23:05] describing the spot like raat Rael the
[1:23:08] heights of
[1:23:10] Rachel or uh it goes on the word uh here
[1:23:16] is translated in English
[1:23:19] Pride it's a form of the Hebrew word
[1:23:23] room
[1:23:25] and it means high or lifted up it
[1:23:28] modifies the Hebrew word in this
[1:23:31] sentence inim which is eyes which is the
[1:23:34] feminine plural in Hebrew you didn't
[1:23:36] need to know that literally it means
[1:23:38] High
[1:23:39] eyes the Bible is saying to us six
[1:23:43] things God hates seven are an
[1:23:47] Abomination to him high
[1:23:51] eyes one of the things the first of the
[1:23:54] things things that he
[1:23:56] despises is someone having high
[1:24:00] eyes I I I want you to understand that
[1:24:03] it seems a bit of a paradox because the
[1:24:06] scripture tells us that we should look
[1:24:08] up look up our Redemption draws nigh the
[1:24:12] scripture tells us that we should cast
[1:24:14] our eyes up or look under the hills from
[1:24:17] whence cometh our help our help comes
[1:24:19] from the Lord Our God and our maker but
[1:24:22] that's not the kind of high eye Abraham
[1:24:24] the Bible said and Abraham lifted up his
[1:24:26] eyes and he beheld what a ram caught in
[1:24:30] the thicket and that was not just any
[1:24:33] Ram that was a ram that was
[1:24:36] testifying uh uh that there was coming a
[1:24:39] sacrifice provided of God on the same
[1:24:42] mountain of Moria the same place there's
[1:24:46] going to be another lamb this time in
[1:24:49] the form of a man and Abraham had to
[1:24:51] look cast his eyes upward to be able to
[1:24:54] see that it means by Revelation he
[1:24:57] looked and saw not just the ram caught
[1:25:00] in the thicket by his horn but he also
[1:25:04] saw the prophetic picture that was to
[1:25:06] come how many of you want to have those
[1:25:08] kinds of eyes I want those kinds of eyes
[1:25:11] the revealed eyes the ones that are able
[1:25:14] to see what natural eyes cannot behold
[1:25:18] we want to be those who are able to
[1:25:20] discern both the times seasons and
[1:25:22] cycles of the Lord
[1:25:24] and we want to be able to not only
[1:25:26] discern what God has said but from what
[1:25:31] that he has said is he saying is he
[1:25:35] emphasizing in this particular moment
[1:25:38] the whole book is God's written record
[1:25:42] of his word amen uh the word is not a
[1:25:47] book the word is a person remember John
[1:25:51] 1 in the beginning was the word the word
[1:25:53] was with God the Word was God drop down
[1:25:56] and you find a verse that says and the
[1:25:59] word became flesh so the word the logos
[1:26:04] is not a book but it's a
[1:26:07] man it can even in this hour be a woman
[1:26:11] because we are to be the word
[1:26:14] demonstrated
[1:26:15] today not in the exact same way that our
[1:26:18] Lord was he was absolutely transformed
[1:26:22] into a body
[1:26:24] that was uh prepared to to be the word
[1:26:28] to carry the word as both God and Son of
[1:26:33] God only
[1:26:35] one two offices that we're mentioning
[1:26:38] here but we know there was three it was
[1:26:41] not Papa father who overshadowed Mary
[1:26:45] the scripture is clear it was the Holy
[1:26:47] Ghost it was the ruach hakodesh our holy
[1:26:51] spirit that overshadowed Mary not a
[1:26:54] person in himself but a demonstration of
[1:26:57] the same God here oh Israel the Lord thy
[1:26:59] God is is one always has been always
[1:27:03] will be and I don't think that we even
[1:27:06] need to be so U dogmatic in limiting him
[1:27:10] to be only three because he's a doctor
[1:27:12] and he's a lawyer and he's a come on
[1:27:14] great physician and he's SAR Shalom
[1:27:17] Prince of Peace and Jehovah Rafa the
[1:27:19] Lord God who heals us so he has many
[1:27:22] attributes many offices many
[1:27:25] administrations many Ministries but only
[1:27:28] one spirit is that right and that Spirit
[1:27:32] became flesh and that flesh was Jesus
[1:27:35] Christ powerful and the blood that he
[1:27:38] shed was not Mary's blood wasn't
[1:27:40] Joseph's blood it was God's blood blood
[1:27:44] that God had prepared specifically for
[1:27:47] the purpose of redemption you see the
[1:27:50] purpose of that blood was to get God's
[1:27:53] life a life on us and not only on us but
[1:27:58] in US animal life wouldn't do it see the
[1:28:03] scripture said the life is in the blood
[1:28:05] so every lamb that died every Ram that
[1:28:08] died every turtle dove that died
[1:28:09] released life it released life but it
[1:28:12] was animal life and therefore it only
[1:28:15] had the ability to cover man's
[1:28:17] transgression but there came a blood
[1:28:20] don't ever forget the power don't ever
[1:28:22] forget the authority don't ever forget
[1:28:25] what the blood has done is doing and
[1:28:27] will
[1:28:28] do should it be our emphasis the life
[1:28:31] that's in that blood should be our
[1:28:33] emphasis because God creator was looking
[1:28:36] for a way to get that life on you and
[1:28:41] ultimately in you so that life came and
[1:28:44] dwelt among us we beheld his glory that
[1:28:49] was God being son Among Us isn't that
[1:28:53] right
[1:28:56] Emmanuel which means what god with us so
[1:29:00] the life was once with us but Jesus is
[1:29:04] leaving and he says something so
[1:29:06] powerfully important I'm leaving you I'm
[1:29:09] out of here but there's a part of me
[1:29:11] that's going to come back it's going to
[1:29:14] fall on you it's not only going to be in
[1:29:17] you and over
[1:29:18] you that life was over you in the Old
[1:29:22] Testament with you in the
[1:29:24] gospels but in the Epistles and the rest
[1:29:27] of the New Testament it's revealed that
[1:29:29] that life is now going to be in You by
[1:29:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:29:35] how many of you are thankful for that
[1:29:37] experience it's so much more than an
[1:29:39] experience it's a transformation it's a
[1:29:42] translation it's taking the life of God
[1:29:45] and putting it inside of mortal men and
[1:29:49] women everything that happened up to
[1:29:51] that point is a type and Shadow we're no
[1:29:54] no longer living in types and shadows
[1:29:56] we're now living in the reality of every
[1:29:59] type and in the reality of every shadow
[1:30:02] because God's own life has come and
[1:30:06] lives inside of us anybody feel like
[1:30:09] helping me a little bit this morning we
[1:30:11] we are going somewhere but it's going to
[1:30:13] take us a minute to get there so we want
[1:30:15] to have the kind of eyes that can see
[1:30:18] not just this realm but another
[1:30:20] dimension another realm we understand
[1:30:24] that Realms are moving this way among us
[1:30:27] there was a time that we only understood
[1:30:30] that Dimensions lay this way but now we
[1:30:33] understand that parallel dimensions are
[1:30:36] running that way not so much this way on
[1:30:40] top of one another somebody said what in
[1:30:42] the world does that mean that means
[1:30:44] eternity is so much closer the spirit
[1:30:48] realm is so much closer than what we
[1:30:51] first thought
[1:30:54] we first thought you've got to be in the
[1:30:56] third
[1:30:57] heaven to even begin to see the
[1:31:00] spiritual things because we had
[1:31:03] everything stacked this way but we begin
[1:31:05] to understand by a message by Ministry
[1:31:08] by teaching we begin to understand that
[1:31:11] that spiritual realm is not a million
[1:31:14] miles away it's not above Earth's
[1:31:17] atmosphere but it's actually in this
[1:31:20] room right now
[1:31:25] it's
[1:31:25] reality that means our loved ones are
[1:31:28] not a million miles away from us this
[1:31:30] isn't wait a minute this isn't New Age
[1:31:33] this is Bible our loved ones are not a
[1:31:36] million miles away from us they're just
[1:31:38] behind a veil that you and I can't
[1:31:40] always see through but one of these
[1:31:44] days and God in his goodness and his
[1:31:47] Mercy there are times that he lets us
[1:31:49] press through the
[1:31:51] veil he let brother brandom go beyond
[1:31:54] the curtain of time many of you have had
[1:31:57] experiences in your Christian Life that
[1:32:00] allowed that other realm to become very
[1:32:02] real to you and I pray that as we get
[1:32:06] the rest of the mud and Gunk and junk
[1:32:08] dug out of our Lives I pray that it sets
[1:32:12] us in such an order that we can live as
[1:32:15] we were created to live dual
[1:32:17] dimensionally we were created to live as
[1:32:21] citizens of Two Worlds
[1:32:24] an eternal one and one that's locked in
[1:32:29] time we were created to be able to walk
[1:32:33] through the natural existence of our
[1:32:35] life while
[1:32:37] engaging that other
[1:32:39] realm one of these days we're going to
[1:32:42] see the reality of that in a greater
[1:32:44] fullness than what we have if you
[1:32:46] believe the message that I believe you
[1:32:48] believe that there's actually coming in
[1:32:50] that Resurrection time a moment we don't
[1:32:52] know how long a short quick period of
[1:32:55] time that our loved ones are going to
[1:32:58] step through the
[1:32:59] veil wouldn't that be Mar marvelous we
[1:33:02] catch a glimpse it produces the rest of
[1:33:05] the faith that we needed to say
[1:33:07] hey somebody said where's the Bible for
[1:33:10] that oh I'm so glad you asked it's in
[1:33:12] the gospels and many of the Saints which
[1:33:14] slept arose and walked again the streets
[1:33:16] of
[1:33:17] Jerusalem if there's ever going to be a
[1:33:20] catching away like our Lord was caught
[1:33:23] he was you can't can't deny that you
[1:33:25] can't deny that he left the uh Jerusalem
[1:33:28] from the mount this same Jesus I'm here
[1:33:31] to tell you the angel said this same
[1:33:33] Jesus that you see leaving in like
[1:33:37] manner he's coming back and if his next
[1:33:41] coming is in the same manner of his
[1:33:42] first coming then don't be surprised if
[1:33:45] it doesn't happen in a similar fashion
[1:33:48] those who were dead in Christ begin to
[1:33:50] make brief moments of appearance in that
[1:33:53] from that realm stepping into this realm
[1:33:55] we see them our faith is sort of
[1:33:58] perfected and finished and we say Lord
[1:34:00] this is it this is real and we wait for
[1:34:03] the change of our body it's coming it's
[1:34:06] coming it's not a way of Escape we're
[1:34:08] not trying to get out of anything I know
[1:34:11] that the modern church out there is
[1:34:13] always talking about raptures being a
[1:34:15] copout well I want you to know it's not
[1:34:17] at all it's simply Revelation 4 come up
[1:34:21] higher I'm going to show you something
[1:34:24] it's just not going to be like the
[1:34:25] church has defined it it's just not
[1:34:28] going to be Millions
[1:34:30] disappear it's just not going to be
[1:34:33] headlines reading all over the world
[1:34:36] it's not going to be quite like that
[1:34:38] come on but there's coming a change
[1:34:41] you're going to be like Enoch one of
[1:34:43] these days you're going to be walking
[1:34:44] around doing what you
[1:34:46] do you step right out of this
[1:34:49] Dimension never coming back to
[1:34:52] timeall Lord glory be to God moving
[1:34:56] on Enoch walked with
[1:34:59] God and he was
[1:35:01] not do you know what the scripture means
[1:35:03] what it says what the original says it
[1:35:06] says Enoch was
[1:35:08] emptied he had to empty himself before
[1:35:11] God could empty
[1:35:12] him he had to get rid of some stuff
[1:35:15] before God could occupy who he was and
[1:35:18] like the old songwriter said uh Enoch
[1:35:20] was just strolling with the Lord one day
[1:35:22] and the Lord said Come On Son we're
[1:35:25] we're closer to my my home to my place
[1:35:28] than we are to yours just come on home
[1:35:30] with me and he did and he did translated
[1:35:35] just like that Elijah translated Chariot
[1:35:39] a fire a chariot with horses of
[1:35:43] fire drew a chariot down Swing Low Sweet
[1:35:47] Chariot the prophet got in and he left
[1:35:50] somebody said that wasn't a physical
[1:35:52] thing well it must have been because
[1:35:54] Elisha caught his mantle not just a
[1:35:57] spiritual mantle the ministry mantle he
[1:35:59] caught a physical mantle amen wrapped it
[1:36:02] around his arms and smoked the river and
[1:36:03] saw the same power same results and if
[1:36:06] you search the scripture double
[1:36:09] Miracles so there is a greater portion
[1:36:12] for the bride of Christ in the last days
[1:36:15] amen so don't get hung up with
[1:36:17] theologians just stay with the word
[1:36:20] there's a greater portion it's in us
[1:36:23] it's full of option it's when your name
[1:36:25] on the check is the same as his name on
[1:36:27] the check the reality is we don't want
[1:36:30] our name we're just going to sign it m
[1:36:33] Jesus Christ because we're tired of our
[1:36:36] old identity our new identity is a part
[1:36:39] of him Hallelujah and and we say Amen we
[1:36:44] say Amen when the preacher says that but
[1:36:47] we forget it when the fever comes we
[1:36:50] forget it when the finances get tight we
[1:36:53] forget it when our fames are shaking
[1:36:55] with some confusion or chaos well I want
[1:36:57] you to know something that's when you
[1:36:59] need to remember who's who you
[1:37:04] are that's when you need to remember
[1:37:07] you've got somebody with you the old him
[1:37:10] no said I have somebody with me to share
[1:37:12] my heavy load I feel his presence near
[1:37:16] me every day and if I were you and I
[1:37:18] didn't feel and experience and engage
[1:37:21] with the presence of the Lord every day
[1:37:23] of your life I would find out
[1:37:26] immediately
[1:37:30] why I wouldn't wait till
[1:37:32] tomorrow I'd find out today why I can go
[1:37:35] two or three days without engaging and
[1:37:38] experiencing the presence of the Lord if
[1:37:41] that is your life you are living below
[1:37:43] your privileges as a Son of God in the
[1:37:46] last Church age you're living below your
[1:37:49] privileges I don't think it's going to
[1:37:52] take a lot to figure out
[1:37:55] why I think a little Common Sense goes a
[1:37:58] long way come
[1:38:00] on somebody said well I just don't know
[1:38:04] if there's any deep dark sin or some
[1:38:07] unconfessed iniquity or some
[1:38:09] generational thing or maybe I've got a
[1:38:11] great great great great great grandpa
[1:38:13] that I haven't repented for his
[1:38:15] lifestyle and so forth oh no it's much
[1:38:18] more simple than that if you're a part
[1:38:20] of the Holy Ghost filled elect of God in
[1:38:23] this hour
[1:38:24] and you're not experiencing the presence
[1:38:26] of the Lord I don't think the problem
[1:38:28] lays in five generations back I think
[1:38:32] the problem lays with us we're not
[1:38:35] giving him the time he deserves and it's
[1:38:37] not the quantity of time it's the
[1:38:40] quality of time it's making him our
[1:38:42] number one priority it's saying Lord I
[1:38:46] can live without a salad at lunch but I
[1:38:49] cannot live without your presence in my
[1:38:52] life I have to feel the reality of who
[1:38:55] you are this is a love affair this is
[1:38:59] not Church entity this is a love affair
[1:39:02] this is a relationship the king
[1:39:04] bridegroom is walking among and in his
[1:39:08] people in this hour and our prayer needs
[1:39:11] to be
[1:39:12] arise arise oh King in me take up your
[1:39:17] rightful
[1:39:19] place rule and Reign from the Throne of
[1:39:23] my inner
[1:39:25] being if you let him be that personal to
[1:39:28] you he will be if you keep putting him
[1:39:31] on the throne A Million Miles Away
[1:39:33] you'll never even be able to imagine the
[1:39:36] reality of who he is or the proximity
[1:39:39] that he desires to live to your house
[1:39:42] he's not a million miles
[1:39:46] away he's
[1:39:48] omnipresent he's God in this house he's
[1:39:52] just as holy among us as if you were
[1:39:54] standing Before the
[1:39:57] Throne somebody said I need to see an
[1:39:59] image look
[1:40:01] around we fail to see who he is in one
[1:40:05] another because we're looking for some
[1:40:08] kind of you know ethereal
[1:40:13] fog we're looking for the Blue Fog I've
[1:40:16] seen it I know it's
[1:40:19] real we're looking for the pillar of
[1:40:21] fire I've seen it I know it's it's real
[1:40:24] I grew up in Pentecost when the fire of
[1:40:27] God was so real on Highway on the
[1:40:29] highway out
[1:40:31] there that it came in Balls of Fire and
[1:40:35] rolled down the highway as I've told you
[1:40:37] many times before and not just one or
[1:40:40] two but every ey saw it even the
[1:40:42] Skeptics and the critics even those who
[1:40:44] said there's nothing to God manifesting
[1:40:47] himself in the foreign lights that's
[1:40:49] what they called them early' 70s foreign
[1:40:52] lights
[1:40:54] they didn't know what to call them but
[1:40:55] when God showed up and manifested even
[1:40:58] Skeptics and
[1:41:01] unbelievers on now like my grandmother's
[1:41:04] nephew who said Aunt mild I just don't
[1:41:06] believe in those far in l oh she said
[1:41:08] she looked at me she said do you hear
[1:41:12] that she said Glenn Ray doesn't
[1:41:17] believe standing on the old concrete
[1:41:19] steps of the church I'll show you a
[1:41:22] picture back there
[1:41:24] the spirit of God just manifested
[1:41:26] himself not one not two but three Big
[1:41:29] Balls of
[1:41:32] Fire rolling right down the highway he
[1:41:36] goes right down on his
[1:41:40] behind mouth drops
[1:41:43] open total shock holy presence of the
[1:41:47] Lord all around my excuse me my
[1:41:51] grandmother she said
[1:41:56] Glen
[1:41:59] Ray you believe him
[1:42:02] now that's how really was now we may not
[1:42:06] see
[1:42:07] that like we would love to I know just
[1:42:10] the mention of that causes many to say
[1:42:14] oh I'd love to see that well I I did and
[1:42:18] I'd love to see it again but you know
[1:42:20] what I'd really love to see I I'd really
[1:42:23] love to see a people who
[1:42:28] recognized that it's not by a
[1:42:33] sign it's the fact that he now lives in
[1:42:37] us and he'll be God as much as you'll
[1:42:39] let him be in
[1:42:42] you that means when the bad news comes
[1:42:46] it's not the nerve pill you run to
[1:42:51] first it's him
[1:42:54] it's not the home remedy you run to
[1:42:55] first it's not some Crystal you run to
[1:42:58] first
[1:43:00] hello you just run to him oh I need you
[1:43:04] like I've never needed you before and
[1:43:06] the same
[1:43:07] God that's right he stands up in us when
[1:43:10] we let
[1:43:12] him true he stands right up in us will
[1:43:15] The Real Jesus Christ please stand up
[1:43:18] and we're waiting on him to come he's
[1:43:20] here in us this Same Spirit The Same
[1:43:26] Spirit that resurrected Jesus from the
[1:43:30] dead it shall dwell in you and if it
[1:43:35] dwells in you it shall also Quicken and
[1:43:37] change your mortal body it shall also
[1:43:41] anoint your faith to believe that he's
[1:43:44] still a
[1:43:46] Healer it will anoint your faith to
[1:43:49] believe my God shall supply all of my
[1:43:52] needs
[1:43:54] according to his
[1:43:56] riches and Glory you believe it that's
[1:44:00] who he is so we want to lift our eyes up
[1:44:03] above
[1:44:04] circumstances above problems above
[1:44:07] present conditions we don't want to uh
[1:44:11] become uh only
[1:44:14] thermometers who report how bad life is
[1:44:18] how sad life is how bad the news it look
[1:44:22] folks we know all that that's why we're
[1:44:25] we're cutting off the news that's why
[1:44:26] we're turning it
[1:44:28] off it doesn't mean we're hiding I hear
[1:44:31] the news at least a little bit of it
[1:44:32] every day of my life I'm going to it's
[1:44:35] part of my
[1:44:36] obligation but I'm not going to live in
[1:44:38] it amen in fact there's just a real
[1:44:42] pleasurable feeling that comes all over
[1:44:43] me when I turn it off or when
[1:44:48] I because that means there's something
[1:44:50] better coming then we just start singing
[1:44:53] his Praises worshiping him he was in the
[1:44:56] car all the
[1:44:57] time just waiting on the atmosphere to
[1:45:00] be right so that he could manifest that
[1:45:02] he was
[1:45:03] there
[1:45:05] brother I told you that I come to church
[1:45:07] a whole lot lighter than I used to I
[1:45:10] used to listen to Fox News before I left
[1:45:12] the house while I'm getting dressed and
[1:45:15] in the car all the way over here on
[1:45:17] satellite no wonder I'd come in hanging
[1:45:20] my head how are you sleep not very well
[1:45:21] how do you feel not too good
[1:45:24] good
[1:45:26] glory but now I come over here singing
[1:45:28] I'm living up on this mountain and I
[1:45:30] won't come
[1:45:32] down don't stay too long in the valley
[1:45:35] going to move to Higher
[1:45:37] Ground or I sing an oh Henson song I'm
[1:45:41] living in the pages of his word Lord
[1:45:44] that's where I'm living I'm living in
[1:45:46] your word your word is living in
[1:45:49] me I'm abiding in the Vine I know where
[1:45:53] my anchor
[1:45:55] holds praise God it's not in church it's
[1:45:58] not in a Doctrine it's not in a
[1:46:01] denomination my anchor holds in the word
[1:46:05] that word is more than a printed page
[1:46:08] it's a living reality what we don't want
[1:46:10] to do is become prideful because God
[1:46:13] blesses us we spent two Services
[1:46:16] teaching on Lucifer how he got caught up
[1:46:19] in his own amazing ability his own
[1:46:23] Beauty God made him that way it wasn't
[1:46:25] him God made him incredibly beautiful
[1:46:30] more beautiful than any other creature
[1:46:32] in the
[1:46:34] heavenlies and built him in such an
[1:46:36] innate way that his body seemed to
[1:46:40] resonate with the sound of praise and he
[1:46:44] began to get a little you know a little
[1:46:46] elegant a little a little dramatic
[1:46:48] perhaps we don't know we weren't there
[1:46:51] but he got a little excited about who he
[1:46:53] was spent a little too much time in the
[1:46:55] mirror thought he could sing better than
[1:46:57] anybody
[1:46:58] else come on he started dancing but not
[1:47:02] not just for the
[1:47:05] king he started twirling but not just
[1:47:07] for the
[1:47:08] king he started moving around but not
[1:47:11] just to capture the attention of the
[1:47:13] king he realized that all of heaven was
[1:47:15] watching him and boy he milked it to the
[1:47:17] very end didn't he are you making some
[1:47:21] suppositions well yes part of it is but
[1:47:24] but but part of it is not because we
[1:47:27] understand even even the brother
[1:47:29] brandham told us that uh it was he was
[1:47:32] caught up in his own Beauty and that it
[1:47:34] was his pride he started looking at his
[1:47:37] ability leaving God
[1:47:40] out I will Ascend I will put my throne
[1:47:43] above I'll build my kingdom over here I
[1:47:45] don't need to be a part of that King I
[1:47:47] got a better Kingdom over here I'll do
[1:47:49] something different I'll go up so that
[1:47:51] even God has to look up up to see who I
[1:47:53] am and God said oh boy you may persuade
[1:47:56] a third of the Angels but you won't get
[1:47:59] them all in fact I'm getting ready to
[1:48:01] throw you right out of here you're not
[1:48:03] going to have access in and out of the
[1:48:05] throne without
[1:48:08] permission I know the charismatics they
[1:48:10] like to put him there every day well I
[1:48:12] want you to know it's not
[1:48:14] reality he cannot bombard in unless he's
[1:48:17] invited or allowed in the scripture
[1:48:19] tells us there was a time that he was uh
[1:48:22] had full access to that realm accusing
[1:48:24] the Brethren before God now his Dominion
[1:48:28] is in the earth his throne in the second
[1:48:30] heaven and he is the prince of the power
[1:48:33] of the
[1:48:33] air and now he's accusing
[1:48:37] still and he'll accuse you before God if
[1:48:40] God lets him
[1:48:44] in but right now he'd be he's more happy
[1:48:48] or feels more fulfilled if he's just
[1:48:51] accusing you to me and me to you he
[1:48:54] likes to accuse the brother to the
[1:48:55] brother the Brethren to the Brethren
[1:48:57] come on he wants you to be a skeptic of
[1:48:59] even those who walk the Faith with
[1:49:01] you that's how he brings offense that's
[1:49:04] how he come on that's how he brings hurt
[1:49:06] woundedness
[1:49:07] bitterness that's how he paralyzes us
[1:49:10] I'm sick of the devil I'm sick of
[1:49:12] letting him win we know too much about
[1:49:15] him we know too much about how he
[1:49:17] operates to continue to be taken
[1:49:20] in we've got to stop taking the bait I
[1:49:24] said we've got to stop taking the
[1:49:30] bait don't take too much pride in
[1:49:33] anything not even your looks because
[1:49:36] that can change
[1:49:39] overnight not in your what you have you
[1:49:41] can lose that ask
[1:49:44] job you can lose it
[1:49:47] all not because necessarily you're a
[1:49:49] sinner or God hates you but sometimes
[1:49:52] he's testing and proving you'd think
[1:49:55] after as many years as some of us who've
[1:49:57] been on the journey we'd be tested
[1:49:58] enough proven enough but the reality is
[1:50:01] we still got too
[1:50:04] much
[1:50:06] hello of
[1:50:10] junk I believe it was Smith Wigglesworth
[1:50:12] who called it yunk we've got too much
[1:50:15] yunk in
[1:50:19] us all we have to do is let him take out
[1:50:23] the
[1:50:24] trash he knows how give him access to
[1:50:28] every room of your life quit holding
[1:50:30] back some give him all of it let him
[1:50:34] have it all we said that a few weeks ago
[1:50:37] give him Broken
[1:50:38] Dreams give him wounded Hearts give him
[1:50:42] broken toys all of it if it goes all the
[1:50:46] way back to your childhood he's a Healer

[1:50:53] Gilead there's life in the tree for
[1:50:57] you all you got to do is apply it use it

[1:51:17] prayer use it appropriate it come on
[1:51:20] there's power and authority in the name
[1:51:21] of Jesus
[1:51:23] well his mother didn't call him Jesus
[1:51:25] nobody answers to it I've seen him do it
[1:51:29] if you're more comfortable called him
[1:51:31] Yeshua call him that sir or maybe you're
[1:51:34] so sacred name you can't even say
[1:51:40] Yeshua
[1:51:41] yahu that's one of the
[1:51:44] words it doesn't matter it's lining up
[1:51:48] your heart with who he is
[1:51:52] the church is
[1:51:54] often crazy about
[1:51:57] semantics I wish that they would be that
[1:52:00] diligent to seek out the truth of the
[1:52:05] scripture if it doesn't have a word
[1:52:10] base you can't find it in the word
[1:52:13] somebody said is is God limited to his
[1:52:15] word well actually he can do anything
[1:52:17] that he wants to do but he's not going
[1:52:19] to do anything that contradicts his word
[1:52:22] he gave it to us so that we would have
[1:52:24] an absolute sir your pastor is not your
[1:52:26] absolute a prophet is not your absolute
[1:52:30] men are are very
[1:52:32] fallible but God's word it cannot fail
[1:52:36] it cannot
[1:52:39] lie God's word doesn't exaggerate men do
[1:52:44] God's word doesn't leave out details men
[1:52:48] do amen where's your confidence it's got
[1:52:51] to be in the word amen we ought to be
[1:52:53] careful not to cast our confidence away
[1:52:55] from men from our brothers and sisters
[1:52:57] from those that God uses to help us I'm
[1:52:59] not saying in any way that we shouldn't
[1:53:01] have confidence in one another we should
[1:53:04] and if we don't it's because we're
[1:53:06] nurturing offense but our confidence
[1:53:09] must not rely only in men our confidence
[1:53:13] must be in the word in the Lord Jesus
[1:53:16] Christ are are you sure you believe that
[1:53:19] in him is thus sayith the Lord are you
[1:53:21] sure you believe that yes sir cuz I'm
[1:53:24] going to show you something in a minute
[1:53:25] that's in the word and somebody's going
[1:53:27] to get
[1:53:30] quiet if it's in here will you believe
[1:53:33] it if it's in here will you ask the Lord
[1:53:35] to show you how it applies to your life
[1:53:38] if I can show you that the word says it
[1:53:40] would you at least pray and say Lord is
[1:53:42] there any application of that in my life
[1:53:46] will you do it I know you will I know
[1:53:48] you will so the kind of high eyes that
[1:53:51] the scriptures is talking about here in
[1:53:53] Pride and how Pride partners with
[1:53:55] offense it's those you know those hotty
[1:53:58] eyes well if you if you've got your you
[1:54:00] know your nose in the
[1:54:03] air it's
[1:54:05] arrogance it's
[1:54:07] haughtiness that the scripture is
[1:54:09] talking about have you ever known
[1:54:11] anybody that's hotti have you ever been
[1:54:15] hotti you huh how many of you have ever
[1:54:17] known anybody that's just arrogant have
[1:54:19] you ever been arrogant that's the
[1:54:21] question how many of you ever seen
[1:54:23] anybody that just seem to ooze Pride
[1:54:26] have you ever oozed Pride that's the
[1:54:29] real question have I that's the real
[1:54:31] question the reality is there's always
[1:54:34] an example out there we can't fix them
[1:54:38] we can't help them unless God gives us
[1:54:40] the voice to do it we've got to we got
[1:54:42] to help
[1:54:43] ourselves you can recognize in other
[1:54:46] people what you can't see in yourself we
[1:54:48] need the word wo we need God to talk to
[1:54:52] us from his word because he makes us
[1:54:55] personal I don't believe in Ultimate
[1:54:57] reconciliation make sure you understand
[1:54:59] that we don't preach universalism here
[1:55:01] make sure you understand that we don't
[1:55:04] believe that everybody's saved we
[1:55:05] believe it's a Bible Way
[1:55:08] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:55:11] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:55:13] you become a candidate to receive the
[1:55:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what
[1:55:16] the word
[1:55:20] said that's what the scripture said if
[1:55:22] it were worked it works if it works then
[1:55:23] it works now we don't believe the
[1:55:25] devil's going to repent in the end time
[1:55:27] and be saved we don't believe that we
[1:55:29] don't believe that you can believe
[1:55:30] anything you want to believe and live
[1:55:33] any life you want to live and be saved
[1:55:35] that's not the god of the Bible you know
[1:55:37] that's a that's a friendly God it is it
[1:55:41] really is he he you know he's a tolerant
[1:55:43] of everything that's so nice I'm so glad
[1:55:46] but you know what that's a God that we
[1:55:48] made we don't need another handmade God
[1:55:51] we don't need another Idol we need the
[1:55:54] one we were singing about today there's
[1:55:56] no God like unto thee among the gods
[1:55:58] you're the only one true Living God your
[1:56:01] word is yay and amen not one jot or t is
[1:56:05] going to pass away if you said it that
[1:56:07] settles it are you with me amen now we
[1:56:11] find that that lifting up the remote the
[1:56:14] the high or lifted up eyes it literally
[1:56:17] means if you put that back up it
[1:56:19] literally means High eyes
[1:56:22] uh idiomatically it means a proud look
[1:56:26] and if we look at the word remote as a
[1:56:28] as a a participle or participle some
[1:56:31] people say I don't but some people do uh
[1:56:35] it describes the state of the eyes being
[1:56:38] elevated while looking
[1:56:41] down on
[1:56:43] others you don't have to go out in the
[1:56:45] world to find somebody to look down on
[1:56:47] if you've got Pride going on in your
[1:56:48] life you'll look down on somebody in
[1:56:51] this house this morning
[1:56:53] and if you do God have mercy on you the
[1:56:55] ground is level at the foot of the
[1:56:59] cross doesn't matter how many digits in
[1:57:01] your in your yearly salary the ground is
[1:57:04] level at the foot of the cross doesn't
[1:57:06] matter what your pedigree is the ground
[1:57:08] is level at the foot of the cross amen
[1:57:11] doesn't matter about your bloodline
[1:57:13] family line family reputation you may
[1:57:16] have horse thieves and slave owners and
[1:57:22] thieves and you you may have somebody in
[1:57:26] your family married five six seven eight
[1:57:28] times cheated on all their
[1:57:30] wives that doesn't make you
[1:57:35] anything the ground is level thank you
[1:57:39] at the foot of the
[1:57:40] cross there's no reason to look down on
[1:57:42] anybody everybody's commanded to repent
[1:57:45] amen amen there was a time that God
[1:57:47] winked at ignorance the scripture said
[1:57:49] there was a time that God said well if
[1:57:50] he don't know any better
[1:57:53] was it's going to be quiet I ain't even
[1:57:54] got to my point yet if he don't know any
[1:57:57] better would the Bible said there was a
[1:57:58] time that God winked at ignorance he
[1:58:01] said if you think those men were Sinners
[1:58:02] at the tower that the Tower of salom
[1:58:05] fell on if you think they were more than
[1:58:06] Sinners more Sinners than you all are he
[1:58:08] said I tell you not and except you
[1:58:11] repent you shall all likewise perish
[1:58:13] pretty serious business isn't it don't
[1:58:16] you think that because somebody died
[1:58:17] like that or was judged a certain way or
[1:58:20] something come along that that uh God
[1:58:22] was winking at that no more he said now
[1:58:24] he commandeth every man to repent so
[1:58:27] ignorance of the truth is not going to
[1:58:29] be an excuse that we can use before the
[1:58:32] Lord in fact we're just going to be
[1:58:36] inexcusable so we better get our excuses
[1:58:38] run through here let the word do what
[1:58:41] the word came to do and just say yes
[1:58:44] Lord yes I just say yes God said I don't
[1:58:47] want you to do that anymore you know
[1:58:48] what your answer needs to be you're
[1:58:49] going to have to help me Lord yes
[1:58:52] I don't want you running around that way
[1:58:53] no more what what's your answer got to
[1:58:55] be Lord you got to help me but my answer
[1:58:58] is
[1:59:00] yes oh and don't don't make God act you
[1:59:03] know God doesn't have
[1:59:05] Alzheimer's God doesn't have split
[1:59:08] personality God is Not schizophrenic sir
[1:59:11] doesn't have panic attacks
[1:59:14] either God is Not uh you know he doesn't
[1:59:17] have all these different uh entities
[1:59:21] going on like they to tell us you know
[1:59:23] God the father's mad and God the son
[1:59:28] is Savior and God the Holy Ghost is
[1:59:32] sweet and laughs all the
[1:59:34] time you you're you're putting him in a
[1:59:37] box still God's everything the word says
[1:59:40] He is there's nothing that he's ever
[1:59:43] been that he can't be right
[1:59:48] now he's the same yes you can say
[1:59:53] man if you believe it so we're not
[1:59:56] looking down on others look at look at
[1:59:58] Proverbs 16 uh
[2:00:00] 5 same same book but but 10 chapters
[2:00:04] later he said everyone that is proud in
[2:00:07] heart remember this is part of a bigger
[2:00:10] series that says above all else guard
[2:00:13] your heart which relates to the soul the
[2:00:15] mind the will and the emotions and
[2:00:17] that's where the problem is and brother
[2:00:20] bham told us the greatest battle ever
[2:00:21] fought going to be fought on the
[2:00:22] Battlegrounds of the mind if that little
[2:00:25] bride can win there she's won the rest
[2:00:27] it's all it's over with then this is
[2:00:30] where the enemy comes against us
[2:00:33] here he tries to disqualify us all the
[2:00:36] time you've got to read the promises of
[2:00:38] God and speak them over your life or the
[2:00:41] enemy will find you at a weak moment and
[2:00:43] convince you that you're not one of them
[2:00:46] you ought to grab your bible run all
[2:00:48] over your house singing I'm one of them
[2:00:49] I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can
[2:00:51] say I'm one of them tell the Devil he's
[2:00:53] a liar in fact when he starts his talk
[2:00:56] we ought to shut him up at the
[2:00:59] beginning seems like we want to just
[2:01:01] listen to see what he's going to offer
[2:01:03] he doesn't have anything to offer he's a
[2:01:07] liar he's the father of all lies he's
[2:01:10] never going to tell you what you can be
[2:01:12] in Jesus Christ he's going to make you
[2:01:15] feel guilty for everything you've
[2:01:16] already done that you've already
[2:01:17] repented over and already been forgiven
[2:01:19] for he's the only one that won't don't
[2:01:22] forget he wrote it down he's going to
[2:01:25] remember he's going to remind you he
[2:01:27] wants you to keep
[2:01:28] paying he's almost a Roman
[2:01:31] Catholic he wants you to keep paying for
[2:01:34] what you've done over and over and over
[2:01:36] because the blood of Jesus is not enough
[2:01:38] I want you to know it's
[2:01:43] enough where are you his blood is enough
[2:01:49] everyone that is proud in heart
[2:01:52] is an Abomination to the
[2:01:54] Lord though hand join in
[2:01:58] hand he shall not be unpunished Old
[2:02:01] Testament I hear you Old
[2:02:05] Testament what the scripture say what
[2:02:08] did the Bible tell us all
[2:02:11] scripture is profitable for Doctrine for
[2:02:14] reproof for correction for instruction
[2:02:16] we need it all we have to keep it in its
[2:02:19] place we have to understand the Covenant
[2:02:20] that it falls under and how it applies
[2:02:22] to us today but we don't throw out the
[2:02:24] baby with the bath water oh no sir we
[2:02:26] want it all every promise in the book is
[2:02:29] mine if God can do it for you he can do
[2:02:32] it for me if God could do it for Jack Co
[2:02:34] and Ora Roberts and come on all the way
[2:02:36] down if God can do that he can do it for
[2:02:39] us if we pay a price there is a price to
[2:02:43] pay and that's emptying oursel Enoch had
[2:02:45] to get rid of who he was so that he
[2:02:47] could let God come and live in him
[2:02:50] that's that's actually what the what the
[2:02:51] Hebrew says he was not well we we always
[2:02:55] interpret that to mean he disappeared
[2:02:57] and he did but he was not before he was
[2:03:03] not and and you've got to be a wasn
[2:03:07] not you I have to be a wasnot I realize
[2:03:11] sometime I'm not there yet but I'm
[2:03:14] pushing
[2:03:15] through you still here good cuz I'm not
[2:03:18] nearly done again if you have to slip
[2:03:21] out with understand no no
[2:03:24] condemnation W you look at that in the
[2:03:26] Amplified
[2:03:27] quickly everyone proud and arrogant and
[2:03:30] heart is
[2:03:34] disgusting
[2:03:36] oh
[2:03:37] wow I knew that old Amplified Bible
[2:03:40] wasn't no
[2:03:42] good Oh you mean it doesn't clean things
[2:03:44] up with Victorian
[2:03:50] English if actually looks right to the
[2:03:53] root meaning of the word
[2:03:56] Abomination everyone proud and arrogant
[2:03:59] in heart is disgusting hateful and
[2:04:02] exceedingly offensive to the
[2:04:04] Lord that doesn't sound like the gospel
[2:04:06] of the modern Church does it be assured
[2:04:10] I pledge it they will not go
[2:04:14] unpunished I know there are many of us
[2:04:16] who probably would hope that that was
[2:04:17] only referring to the older Covenant but
[2:04:20] it actually refers to the character and
[2:04:22] nature of God may I just say this and it
[2:04:25] won't go over well with all the people
[2:04:27] who hear this wherever you might access
[2:04:29] this service but the reality is if God
[2:04:31] hated
[2:04:36] it if God ever hated it he still hates
[2:04:41] it now the question is did he ever hate
[2:04:43] it well we don't go back to the old
[2:04:46] church to figure that out we go back to
[2:04:48] the
[2:04:49] word you see there were those was under
[2:04:52] the old church who who would teach it
[2:04:54] you know God hated everything including
[2:05:00] everybody they went too far when they
[2:05:02] told me that God hated Dr
[2:05:06] Pepper I knew that wasn't
[2:05:11] possible if God ever hated
[2:05:14] it you see you can't have it both ways
[2:05:18] he's an unchanging God if he ever loved
[2:05:21] it
[2:05:23] he still loves it if you ever loved him
[2:05:27] he still loves
[2:05:29] him if he ever loved her he still loves
[2:05:32] her he's not willing that any should
[2:05:35] perish but that all should come to
[2:05:37] eternal life but there's a way to come
[2:05:40] there's a door open there's a Calvary
[2:05:43] way there's a blood way you got to come
[2:05:45] a bloody path you've got to accept the
[2:05:48] life of his blood to be saved baptized
[2:05:51] in his his name and filled with the same
[2:05:54] life that he operated in in his Earthly
[2:05:57] Ministry it's not joining a church it's
[2:06:00] having a relationship with Jesus Christ
[2:06:02] a personal relationship that word
[2:06:05] Abomination is something that the church
[2:06:07] would like to redefine for us in this
[2:06:10] modern time I feel quite
[2:06:12] sure but the reality is it means the
[2:06:15] same in the New Testament that it does
[2:06:17] in the Old Testament the word in Hebrew
[2:06:20] is
[2:06:22] toar and it means something
[2:06:27] disgusting if God says that a proud look
[2:06:32] is
[2:06:33] disgusting in his
[2:06:35] eyes he means that we shouldn't wear
[2:06:39] that kind of a look if you carry that
[2:06:42] kind of an
[2:06:43] heir some people like to say Aura if you
[2:06:46] carry
[2:06:47] that God's not pleased with that you're
[2:06:50] not disgusting
[2:06:52] you're
[2:06:53] broken but that look on your
[2:06:56] face that attitude that you carry if
[2:06:59] you're operating in Pride and it doesn't
[2:07:02] matter whether it's family Pride
[2:07:04] educational Pride or even bride
[2:07:08] Pride because some people get a
[2:07:10] revelation of election and that makes
[2:07:13] them have bride pride and they think
[2:07:15] they're better than anybody else because
[2:07:17] they've heard the bridal message well
[2:07:19] that doesn't make you better it makes
[2:07:20] you more accountable
[2:07:24] if you have heard a Midnight
[2:07:27] Cry then that gives you the
[2:07:30] responsibility to be more
[2:07:32] accountable so so we ought not to strut
[2:07:35] around because of what we know or what
[2:07:36] we believe or who we follow or what come
[2:07:38] on so any any proud look is disgusting
[2:07:42] let me tell you something I have had
[2:07:44] pride in my life and God knows how to
[2:07:47] work it
[2:07:48] out he has before he can do it again
[2:07:52] in and that was disgusting I wasn't
[2:07:54] disgusting to God but that pride in my
[2:07:58] life that offense that I nurture and
[2:08:00] carry that
[2:08:02] bitterness
[2:08:03] jealousy cooler than the grave so unlike
[2:08:06] Christ but from time to time that stuff
[2:08:09] is operated in us may I say even as
[2:08:13] Believers anybody here even as Believers
[2:08:17] I know that we don't like to have that
[2:08:19] thought we we would like to think that
[2:08:21] as Believers we have you know reached
[2:08:23] the epitome of of perfection but no
[2:08:26] we're climbing we're climbing we're
[2:08:28] moving up that uh that stature of the
[2:08:31] perfect man we're making our way higher
[2:08:35] climbing
[2:08:36] Zion it's a rough road like the old uh
[2:08:40] black preacher used to sing I'm coming
[2:08:42] up the Rough Side of the Mountain but
[2:08:46] I'm doing my best to make it home how
[2:08:48] many of you have ever had to sing it I'm
[2:08:50] coming
[2:08:53] some of you heard a a eagle call a
[2:08:55] higher
[2:08:56] call come up higher Revelation 4 call
[2:09:00] and you said Lord I'm coming but you
[2:09:01] found out it wasn't as easy to get there
[2:09:03] as you thought he called me he invited
[2:09:05] me so I ought to be able to do this on
[2:09:07] my own no it's every inch by his help
[2:09:11] and Grace and sometimes it takes us
[2:09:13] longer to go up than what we thought but
[2:09:15] we're still on our way tell them
[2:09:17] remember remember the old spiritual said
[2:09:19] tell them when you saw me I was on my
[2:09:20] way amen if you get there before I do
[2:09:23] tell them over Yonder when you saw me
[2:09:25] the LI I was on my way wasn't there yet
[2:09:28] but I'm on the journey how many of you
[2:09:30] can say I'm not there yet but I'm on the

[2:09:40] victory in the journey we get knocked
[2:09:43] down we get up

[2:09:50] thing but every time you get
[2:09:55] up that's another thing you're an eagle

[2:10:02] eagle you were born to be
[2:10:04] one elected the soar I don't care how
[2:10:08] many years you spent in an old
[2:10:09] denominational Barnard pecking around
[2:10:13] eating chicken worms you were never
[2:10:16] ordained to grow on chicken worms woo

[2:10:34] what it is doing and what it's going to
[2:10:36] do you see I've learned that the author
[2:10:38] of my faith is also the finisher of my
[2:10:40] faith and what he started in me the good
[2:10:42] work he
[2:10:43] started he's going to he's going to
[2:10:45] finish it all I have to keep doing say

[2:10:50] Lord I Surrender
[2:10:52] I've got my eyes on you amen remember if
[2:10:55] you need to go you
[2:10:58] can it says uh something disgusting
[2:11:01] morally an
[2:11:03] abhorrence you see the word abomination
[2:11:05] in the Old Testament often
[2:11:08] appears as something that God abor
[2:11:12] abhor can you say
[2:11:14] abhor do you know what it is it's the
[2:11:17] strongest degree of hate
[2:11:22] uh there are some things I don't like
[2:11:24] and there's some things I might even I I
[2:11:26] try not to say it but there are some
[2:11:27] things I might say well I hate I I don't
[2:11:29] I hate those I I like brussels
[2:11:34] sprouts I I can eat a whole head of
[2:11:37] cabbage but I I don't like I don't
[2:11:40] really like brussels sprouts I don't
[2:11:41] guess I hate them anymore because I can
[2:11:43] eat them I got a family that likes them
[2:11:45] and a daughter-in-law that really likes
[2:11:47] them and I found out if you smother them
[2:11:50] in something else else it's like
[2:11:51] broccoli you can eat it just cover it in
[2:11:54] cheese
[2:11:58] and bathe it in balsamic vinegar and
[2:12:01] bake it in the oven till it's no more
[2:12:03] and and then you you
[2:12:05] can but I wouldn't say I abhor them
[2:12:08] because I eat
[2:12:09] them just something I don't
[2:12:13] prefer abhor is a very strong word I
[2:12:17] just can't imagine using that in our
[2:12:20] everyday language you know I just have
[2:12:22] horror cold
[2:12:23] weather it sounds a little
[2:12:26] overdone you don't like it you might
[2:12:28] even say you hate it but I don't know
[2:12:30] that you would say you abhor
[2:12:33] it just buy another sweater and press
[2:12:36] on abhor is really a serious word and
[2:12:41] Abomination captures the reality of what
[2:12:43] it means to hate something so bad that
[2:12:46] you abhor
[2:12:48] it strongest degree of hate
[2:12:51] and everyone who operates in Pride and
[2:12:54] arrogancy God said I hate
[2:12:57] that not
[2:12:59] them I hate that look of arrogancy I
[2:13:03] hate that attitude of of arrogancy I
[2:13:06] hate that attitude of Pride I abore it
[2:13:09] it's an abominate one who SWS Discord
[2:13:11] among the Brethren God said I hate
[2:13:15] that if you don't want to be a part of
[2:13:17] the family get
[2:13:18] out but don't stir up and call CA
[2:13:21] Discord just what God Said I hate when
[2:13:23] people God said a lying tongue you don't
[2:13:26] have to
[2:13:27] lie you can put your finger over your
[2:13:30] mouth and take the silent treatment you
[2:13:32] you can say I plead the fifth you can
[2:13:34] just not answer some of you don't look
[2:13:36] at me like that because you're
[2:13:41] experts you know how to dance some of
[2:13:44] you like a little dancing goat you know
[2:13:46] how to move around when you don't want
[2:13:47] to tell something you know how to
[2:13:49] maneuver you think it's slick you think
[2:13:52] it's
[2:13:53] cute woo it's quiet you know how not to
[2:13:57] tell it you also know how to almost tell
[2:14:01] it but but cover your you know what I
[2:14:06] mean cover yourself so that if they ask
[2:14:09] you if you told it you can say you
[2:14:12] didn't we know how to
[2:14:14] operate come on but God sees
[2:14:18] us he sees us here
[2:14:21] something that's detestable I'm moving
[2:14:23] on I got
[2:14:24] to before I lose every
[2:14:27] amen this word Abomination appears 117
[2:14:31] times in the
[2:14:33] Bible I I read every verse this
[2:14:37] week I'm
[2:14:39] amazed at some of the things that God
[2:14:42] says the most popular if you could say
[2:14:45] that of the of the Abominations are the
[2:14:48] seven that are mentioned here in this p
[2:14:51] portion of scripture but there are many
[2:14:52] other things that God said I just
[2:14:55] despise
[2:15:00] that for instance under the law he said
[2:15:02] if a if a man finds
[2:15:06] a an uncleanness in a
[2:15:09] wife and he puts her away because of
[2:15:14] that uncleanness gives her a bill of
[2:15:16] divorcement because of that uncleanness
[2:15:18] now please remember that's a very
[2:15:20] specific reason
[2:15:21] reason and it goes to dishonesty and
[2:15:25] deception about her Purity if you read
[2:15:27] the context and if a woman lies about
[2:15:30] that and a husband later finds out that
[2:15:31] was not the case under
[2:15:35] the Old
[2:15:37] Testament scripture said he can put her
[2:15:40] away Bible also says that she can take
[2:15:42] another
[2:15:43] husband she can then go and remarry
[2:15:46] Deuteronomy
[2:15:48] 2 41 or something like that I may be I
[2:15:51] know may not have it quite right but
[2:15:53] anyway and it says that if if he goes
[2:15:56] and or excuse me if she goes and takes
[2:16:00] another husband she can says she can but
[2:16:04] if she does she cannot come
[2:16:07] back to that first
[2:16:11] husband I mean she wasn't clean enough
[2:16:13] good enough and holy enough the first
[2:16:15] time you see it's it's a scriptural
[2:16:18] reason he had to do it under that lie
[2:16:21] deception of Purity it has to do with
[2:16:23] the tokens of virginity we've taught it
[2:16:26] it's it's actually a very holy
[2:16:29] thing in in in a bridal Paradigm it's a
[2:16:32] very holy thing but if a man decides he
[2:16:35] puts his wife away she could go on he
[2:16:37] said to take another spouse if I'm
[2:16:38] reading it right and I think I am pretty
[2:16:40] plain English but she could then not
[2:16:42] come back if that husband was gone that
[2:16:45] second husband whatever happened she
[2:16:46] couldn't come back if that first husband
[2:16:48] took her back under those circumstances
[2:16:50] of putting her away the Bible said it
[2:16:53] would be an
[2:16:56] Abomination for him to take her back am
[2:16:58] I right
[2:16:59] brother 241 2 3
[2:17:02] 4 1 2 3 4 you you you go all the way
[2:17:05] through that scripture now I don't know
[2:17:09] exactly why God said that but he said
[2:17:14] it and somebody said well sh I'm so glad
[2:17:17] that don't apply it don't
[2:17:21] somebody say well that's under the law
[2:17:23] you pay your tithe don't
[2:17:25] you that's under the law too you see
[2:17:28] there are many things that have carried
[2:17:31] over I know that we would like to
[2:17:32] exclude them
[2:17:34] all we would only take the Jerusalem
[2:17:37] mandate there in the book of Acts if we
[2:17:39] could and those are the only things that
[2:17:40] we would claim have any kind of
[2:17:42] uncleanness in them at all five or six
[2:17:44] things you know but there are certain
[2:17:46] things that do not tie specifically to
[2:17:49] the uh Temple
[2:17:52] service you there are certain things you
[2:17:54] can't you couldn't abide by because
[2:17:56] there's no temple in place and no
[2:17:58] sacrifice in place except the only one
[2:18:00] that
[2:18:02] matters and so there are certain things
[2:18:05] that you certainly could but there are
[2:18:06] things that are morally
[2:18:09] disgusting whether you agree or not God
[2:18:12] said there are certain things that are
[2:18:14] just morally disgusting to him and those
[2:18:17] things can't
[2:18:18] change if you let that change in your
[2:18:21] faith and in your religion then you're
[2:18:23] making God
[2:18:24] schizophrenic and you're saying that God
[2:18:26] has one personality one time and one
[2:18:28] another that he that he can hate
[2:18:31] something one minute and love something
[2:18:33] the next minute and hate something the
[2:18:35] next minute that's his character when
[2:18:37] God said that is AB horrible to
[2:18:40] me you have to look at it as part of his
[2:18:45] character you may change your
[2:18:48] preferences but God is Not Low by reason
[2:18:51] of his word he told us by reason of his
[2:18:55] word he can't change his mind if he ever
[2:18:58] thought that a proud look a lying
[2:19:02] tongue feet that are uh hands that shed
[2:19:06] innocent blood a heart that deviseth
[2:19:08] Wicked imaginations feet that are Swift
[2:19:10] and running to Mischief a false witness
[2:19:12] speaking lies and he that sth Discord
[2:19:14] among the Brethren if he ever thought
[2:19:16] that those things were morally
[2:19:18] disgusting
[2:19:21] doesn't matter what Covenant you're
[2:19:23] under he still
[2:19:25] does
[2:19:27] oh now you know where I'm
[2:19:31] going there's just something about Pride
[2:19:34] let's go back to that for a moment
[2:19:35] there's just something about arrogancy
[2:19:37] there's just something about haughtiness
[2:19:39] that God said I'm not having it in my
[2:19:43] people I don't love you
[2:19:46] less but I hate that disgusting Behavior
[2:19:50] that's what the word said you believe
[2:19:52] that don't
[2:19:53] you now somebody say yeah but you know
[2:19:56] that Bible said that if you uh wear wool
[2:19:59] and linen mixed together that's wrong
[2:20:02] and if you plant corn and beans in the
[2:20:05] same row that's wrong well he says there
[2:20:06] are a lot of things that are
[2:20:09] wrong under a a covenant that is
[2:20:13] connected to a sacrificial
[2:20:16] system amen that's right is it 600 11 or
[2:20:21] 613
[2:20:22] Commandments and uh some of those
[2:20:25] Commandments are directly connected to
[2:20:27] Temple worship and we would have a very
[2:20:29] hard time doing those things but when
[2:20:32] God said I hate
[2:20:33] it when the scripture says he didn't say
[2:20:36] I it's an Abomination for beans and corn
[2:20:39] to be planted in the same roow did
[2:20:42] he he didn't say it's an Abomination for
[2:20:46] you to wear linen and cotton or wool or
[2:20:49] what he didn't say it's abomination
[2:20:51] no
[2:20:53] M didn't say
[2:20:56] that those things are connected to an
[2:20:58] identity that God wanted his people to
[2:21:01] have if you were uh among the Heathen
[2:21:04] and you were walking by a farm and you
[2:21:07] saw a farm that was set up like that a a
[2:21:11] crop a field that was set up like that
[2:21:13] God wanted it to be so that you would
[2:21:17] know that is a field that belongs to the
[2:21:20] followers of
[2:21:21] Yahweh that's God's people there whether
[2:21:24] they believe that God or not that's them
[2:21:27] folks sometimes they call them the God
[2:21:29] those who follow the god of no name or
[2:21:31] the the unknown God or they called him
[2:21:32] all kinds of different things but God
[2:21:34] wanted his people to present themselves
[2:21:36] in such a way that wherever they were
[2:21:39] and under what any circumstance uh
[2:21:42] whether it was in the market or in a
[2:21:44] private home or or on a a job or in a
[2:21:47] field he wanted his people to be
[2:21:49] distinct enough
[2:21:51] that's right that the whole world would
[2:21:53] know they're mine I love that I love
[2:21:57] being his
[2:21:58] segula I love being a peculiar treasure
[2:22:01] to Jesus Christ I love that when he said
[2:22:04] A peculiar people he wasn't talking
[2:22:06] about see how weird we can get I love
[2:22:08] the fact that he was referring back to
[2:22:10] the Old Testament uh concept of a king
[2:22:13] having many treasures and many wealthy
[2:22:17] uh uh expressions of wealth but among
[2:22:20] all all of the gold and the silver the
[2:22:22] king always had a
[2:22:24] segula he always had a particular place
[2:22:27] where his most prized treasure was
[2:22:32] kept and he would visit
[2:22:36] it he loved looking at it his heart
[2:22:40] didn't trust in it but it was
[2:22:42] exclusively his and no one
[2:22:46] else's and the New Testament captured
[2:22:48] the thought and said you are a peculiar
[2:22:52] people a holy nation come on separate
[2:22:56] from the rest of the world you're mine
[2:22:59] my Mark is on
[2:23:02] you you're going to walk right and talk
[2:23:05] right and do right and spit
[2:23:08] white because my Mark is on you there's
[2:23:11] another
[2:23:13] Mark the church is waiting on it to
[2:23:15] appear but the reality is it's been here
[2:23:18] for a long long time script natur the
[2:23:21] Bible said in the New Testament that the
[2:23:23] mystery of
[2:23:26] iniquity doth already work and the
[2:23:29] Mystery of iniquity and the and the and
[2:23:31] the son of predition are tied together
[2:23:34] in the New Testament isn't that right
[2:23:36] and the son of predition in the New
[2:23:38] Testament is a forerunner of the
[2:23:41] Antichrist which is a system that's
[2:23:43] already in
[2:23:45] place it's already in
[2:23:47] place and I don't want no part of it
[2:23:49] amen anybody here I just don't want any
[2:23:53] part of it if that seems Pride if that's
[2:23:55] arrogant if you think that's too tough I
[2:23:57] apologize to you for the way I'm making
[2:23:58] it sound I don't want any part of that
[2:24:01] system God called us out thank you Jesus
[2:24:04] he called us out I'm not going to spend
[2:24:06] all my life condemning that system but
[2:24:08] I'm going to walk separate from it I
[2:24:11] don't want it up here I don't want that
[2:24:13] over my
[2:24:14] thinking you see I don't want to receive
[2:24:16] a mark in my in my in my thought life
[2:24:20] my forehead and I don't want to join
[2:24:22] myself like a right hand of Fellowship I
[2:24:24] don't want to join myself to A system
[2:24:26] that God has said that's
[2:24:29] Antichrist it's not Christ and that word
[2:24:32] anti doesn't always mean as a prefix in
[2:24:35] the Greek it doesn't always mean
[2:24:37] against sometimes it means
[2:24:40] another there's another Christ that's
[2:24:43] why Jesus said in the last days are
[2:24:44] going to come and say Christ is here and
[2:24:46] Christ is there don't you follow
[2:24:49] them why would he say that because
[2:24:51] you're always going to know where he is
[2:24:53] how many of you are always going to know
[2:24:55] where Jesus is he's in his word he's in
[2:24:58] his people you don't have to go to
[2:25:00] Jerusalem to find him you don't have to
[2:25:03] go to Jeffersonville to find him you
[2:25:05] don't have to go to Tucson to find him
[2:25:08] you don't have to go to Mecca to find
[2:25:09] him we know right where Jesus is right
[2:25:12] now he's in
[2:25:14] me Hallelujah somebody said isn't that a
[2:25:17] little bit much to say it's not enough
[2:25:19] to say amen and once we get a revelation
[2:25:22] of that we'll live a different life and
[2:25:25] we'll operate in a victory that's
[2:25:28] higher we'll we will absolutely move in
[2:25:31] a Deliverance that is
[2:25:33] higher than we've ever
[2:25:37] known God may not take away from you
[2:25:40] what he didn't give you but he'll pull
[2:25:43] you up into a place of
[2:25:45] Deliverance where the things you once
[2:25:48] hated you will now love and the things
[2:25:50] you once loved you will now hate if
[2:25:53] there are things in your life that are
[2:25:54] not good for you and not right for you I
[2:25:57] pray and for me as well I pray that God
[2:25:59] will lift us up to a higher place and
[2:26:02] that if we're holding on and even loving
[2:26:04] something that God said I don't want you
[2:26:06] to have any part of that we'll begin to
[2:26:07] despise the very thing that we adore
[2:26:10] somebody said why would you pray such a
[2:26:12] prayer as that because the Bible said
[2:26:14] that's what God wants to do in us we are
[2:26:17] not normal regular creat
[2:26:24] ations he said that he told us when
[2:26:27] you've got my life in you the life that
[2:26:29] that that I'm living now the Apostle
[2:26:31] said that's not my life I laid that down
[2:26:35] I'm not trying to operate on my own
[2:26:37] understanding my own intellect my own
[2:26:39] mind we now have I thank God he said it
[2:26:42] can be a present tense even when I don't
[2:26:45] always operate in that I want to confess
[2:26:47] it over my life I now have the mind of
[2:26:49] Christ
[2:26:52] even when I don't feel like I'm seated
[2:26:53] in Heavenly places I want to be able to
[2:26:56] confess what the word said today we are
[2:26:58] seated together in Heavenly places in
[2:27:01] Christ Jesus some of us have colds and
[2:27:05] and coughs and some of us are tired and
[2:27:07] and we fought physical battles and and
[2:27:10] and and we may not be 100% but the
[2:27:13] reality is the word said we now have the
[2:27:17] mind of Christ the word said we are now
[2:27:21] seated together in Heavenly places in
[2:27:25] Christ Jesus some folks are waiting on
[2:27:29] what is already present
[2:27:31] reality if we're looking at it with the
[2:27:33] right
[2:27:34] glasses you need isav Lord give me more
[2:27:37] Isa are you with me got to hurry let's
[2:27:40] see what time it is I see some of you
[2:27:42] looking you can slip out if you need
[2:27:48] to and horen something
[2:27:51] detestable this word is used 117 times
[2:27:54] in ancient Israelite culture the concept
[2:27:59] of
[2:27:59] toall was deeply
[2:28:02] tied to the covenantal
[2:28:07] relationship between God and his
[2:28:09] people practices deemed were those that
[2:28:14] violated the Holiness and Purity
[2:28:18] required by the
[2:28:23] law
[2:28:25] Idols were considered
[2:28:29] Abomination this included
[2:28:32] idolatry sexual
[2:28:34] immorality
[2:28:36] unjust
[2:28:38] practices
[2:28:40] cheating more than once the scripture
[2:28:43] that's just boil it down says
[2:28:47] cheating ducking under
[2:28:51] moving
[2:28:52] around the law
[2:28:57] cheating more than once God said that's
[2:28:59] an
[2:29:02] Abomination unjust practices the term
[2:29:05] reflects the cultural and religious
[2:29:07] boundaries that set Israel apart from
[2:29:10] surrounding Nations emphasizing the call
[2:29:13] to Holiness and obedience to God's
[2:29:17] Commandments I don't see anything in
[2:29:19] there that says
[2:29:21] that God changes his mind about what he
[2:29:25] considers to be
[2:29:27] idolatry or that he changes his mind
[2:29:29] about what he considers to be sexually
[2:29:33] immoral including prideful Behavior a
[2:29:37] proud look lifted up eyes one who SS
[2:29:40] Discord among the Brethren now we've got
[2:29:43] to we've got in the time we have we have
[2:29:45] to move quickly look at Revelation 171
[2:29:48] with me
[2:29:50] uh I I talked about this Tuesday night
[2:29:53] but I didn't read it I want to read it
[2:29:54] take me a moment to read it Revelation
[2:29:56] 1771 and there came one of the Seven
[2:29:58] Angels which had the seven vials and
[2:30:01] talked with me saying unto me come
[2:30:03] hither I will show unto thee the
[2:30:05] Judgment of the great that sth
[2:30:07] upon many Waters with whom the kings of
[2:30:10] the Earth have committed fornication and
[2:30:12] the inhabitants of the Earth have been
[2:30:13] made drunk with the wine of her
[2:30:16] fornication so he carried me away in the
[2:30:19] spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a
[2:30:21] woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast
[2:30:23] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[2:30:26] heads and 10 horns you're following
[2:30:29] along so far and the woman was arrayed
[2:30:32] in purple and scarlet color purple and
[2:30:34] red and decked with gold and precious
[2:30:37] stones and Pearls having a golden cup in
[2:30:40] her hand full
[2:30:43] of
[2:30:45] Abominations and filthiness of her
[2:30:49] fornication I want you know God hates
[2:30:50] what's in that
[2:30:52] cup that cup is full of Abominations and
[2:30:56] filthiness of her fornication the
[2:30:59] scripture calls her a it doesn't
[2:31:01] take a whole lot of discernment to
[2:31:03] recognize that she actually is a
[2:31:05] religious
[2:31:06] system that religious system will make
[2:31:09] its Covenant with a political system in
[2:31:11] the end
[2:31:13] time Pap Rome joining with political
[2:31:17] Rome H becoming the the reality of
[2:31:20] mystery
[2:31:21] Babylon people don't want to talk about
[2:31:24] it uh people don't like to think about
[2:31:26] it you hear church people say I'm scared
[2:31:29] of the Book of Revelation you ought not
[2:31:31] to be scared of
[2:31:35] anything you you know fear is the
[2:31:37] opposite of Faith perfect love casteth
[2:31:40] out fear you experience this perfect
[2:31:43] love you don't have to be afraid of the
[2:31:44] book of the Revelation or any other book
[2:31:46] in the Bible the book of the Revelation
[2:31:49] is the only book in the Bible where God
[2:31:50] said don't add to it don't take away
[2:31:52] from it he didn't say don't understand
[2:31:56] it he said don't add to it don't take
[2:31:58] away from it if you do you're going to
[2:32:00] find that something has been taken out
[2:32:02] on your
[2:32:03] behalf if you want to be as though you
[2:32:06] never existed because if your name comes
[2:32:08] out of the book of
[2:32:10] life it means you've never it is as
[2:32:12] though you never existed Now understand
[2:32:16] that we see in the scripture there's a
[2:32:18] book of life and there is a Lamb's Book
[2:32:20] of
[2:32:22] Life there's one book you can have your
[2:32:25] name blotted out of there's another book
[2:32:27] that you can't have your name blotted
[2:32:28] out of do you understand your name can
[2:32:31] be removed from the book of life it's a
[2:32:33] judgment and it it is as though you
[2:32:35] never existed on the earth that's what
[2:32:36] the scripture teaches but once you have
[2:32:38] the Revelation and indeed it really is
[2:32:40] there your name in the Lamb's Book of
[2:32:42] Life God's going to have
[2:32:44] you he's going to have you if it's there
[2:32:48] he's going to have you
[2:32:50] one way or the
[2:32:51] other
[2:32:54] amen are you extreme calvinist I'm
[2:32:57] not I find my balance in the
[2:33:00] scripture there's reality in both sides
[2:33:03] of that camp he knew me and because he
[2:33:07] knew me he knew my choice he knew what I
[2:33:09] would accept and what I would reject and
[2:33:12] because of that because of his for
[2:33:13] knowledge of me the scripture said he
[2:33:15] predestinated me to be
[2:33:18] conformed to his image that's just the
[2:33:22] word now what about the scripture that
[2:33:24] says don't you think you chose me I
[2:33:26] chose you that's because God saw your
[2:33:29] choice in the beginning and chose you
[2:33:33] from the beginning so that you would
[2:33:36] your life would then be a life that
[2:33:38] would one day bring total reflection of
[2:33:41] who you chose what you chose because he
[2:33:44] said to them he for know forne to them
[2:33:48] he did also pred desate that they would
[2:33:51] be conformed so there's an order to that
[2:33:53] isn't there the glorification is at the
[2:33:56] end of that thing first
[2:33:58] Justified first justified by faith
[2:34:01] Justified never sin that's what the
[2:34:03] blood has done for us if we embrace it
[2:34:06] and hold on to it so here is a woman a
[2:34:09] horish woman sitting on a
[2:34:12] beast dressed in purple and scarlet
[2:34:14] color decked with gold precious stones
[2:34:17] and pearls
[2:34:20] why is that mentioned because like
[2:34:23] Lucifer this church system trusts in her
[2:34:28] beauty in her
[2:34:30] Treasures in her gold in her
[2:34:33] silver in her
[2:34:36] Cathedrals she trusts in the things that
[2:34:38] are
[2:34:39] temporal she puts on all this doodads
[2:34:42] and you know robes and gowns and sensors
[2:34:47] and oh my goodness so many kinds of
[2:34:51] things she puts
[2:34:53] on because she wants to be seen and
[2:34:56] known and her beauty to
[2:34:59] attract but the reality is her judgment
[2:35:02] has already been determined she holds in
[2:35:05] her hand a cup full of Abominations and
[2:35:08] the filthiness of her fornication let's
[2:35:10] read on and upon her
[2:35:12] forehead this woman could never forget
[2:35:15] what she represents because upon her
[2:35:17] forehead was a name written mystery
[2:35:19] Babylon the great and no sir that's not
[2:35:23] the United States of America hear
[2:35:26] me there's a lot of folks in the modern
[2:35:28] church that say that's the United States
[2:35:30] of America it is
[2:35:32] not this woman had mystery Babylon the
[2:35:35] great the mother of harlots she's not
[2:35:37] only a in the scripture but she is
[2:35:40] the mother of other harlots of
[2:35:42] prostitute her daughters are just as
[2:35:46] loose just as pleasure seeking just just
[2:35:49] as
[2:35:51] Beauty
[2:35:53] oriented as she is
[2:35:57] loose adapting adopting doing whatever
[2:36:01] it needs to do to be
[2:36:03] tolerant great Babylon the great the
[2:36:06] mother of Harlot and Abominations she is
[2:36:09] the
[2:36:11] embodiment she is the
[2:36:13] personification of everything that God
[2:36:15] says I hate that I abhor it I find it
[2:36:18] disgusting
[2:36:20] am am I overdoing this
[2:36:22] interpretation I I need a few more
[2:36:24] minutes am I overdoing this do you think
[2:36:27] I'm saying something I shouldn't say
[2:36:30] doesn't it seem that that's exactly what
[2:36:32] is being say said she is the
[2:36:34] representation of everything that God
[2:36:35] calls
[2:36:37] disgusting I abhor it and she loves it
[2:36:40] so much she drinks it and Tattoos it
[2:36:44] right on her head it's right there on
[2:36:45] her head she's proud of who she is and
[2:36:48] what she does she so
[2:36:52] religious she's so
[2:36:56] religious all the Abominations of the
[2:36:58] Earth right there identified and I saw
[2:37:01] the woman drunken with the blood of the
[2:37:04] Saints and with the blood of the martyrs
[2:37:06] of
[2:37:07] Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with
[2:37:11] great
[2:37:13] admiration that's pretty serious
[2:37:15] business there was something about her
[2:37:17] she was captivating she was
[2:37:21] enthralling she was
[2:37:23] attractive John is saying something this
[2:37:26] is a servant of God a prophet of God a
[2:37:29] messenger of
[2:37:30] God on an aisle of patmas boiled in oil
[2:37:33] and Wouldn't Die banished to the aisle
[2:37:36] of patmas given an opportunity that no
[2:37:39] other man was given to see the entire
[2:37:42] revelation of Jesus Christ played out in
[2:37:45] symbol form before his eyes what a man
[2:37:49] what a vessel thank God for his
[2:37:53] obedience I'm so thankful that there was
[2:37:55] no Facebook no Twitter no no
[2:37:58] Instagram to distract him it's just him
[2:38:02] in the
[2:38:03] cave just him on the island and God
[2:38:06] showed up and showed him things that you
[2:38:09] and I needed to know for
[2:38:11] 2025 but he's honest when he says there
[2:38:14] was something about her that made you
[2:38:16] want to uh see her there was some
[2:38:19] admiration there was some wonderings
[2:38:22] some mystery about this woman she was
[2:38:24] somehow attractive remember she
[2:38:27] represents a system a church order that
[2:38:30] is
[2:38:33] attractive if you don't think the
[2:38:36] blood's enough well that's all right
[2:38:38] we've got we've got another way for you
[2:38:40] to feel good about
[2:38:41] yourself you can pray the rosary you can
[2:38:45] come behind the confessional you can uh
[2:38:48] do the hell marry you can quote the
[2:38:50] Apostles Creed you can do all these
[2:38:52] things and still feel okay about
[2:38:54] yourself if you're not so sure that the
[2:38:56] blood of Jesus Christ is
[2:38:58] Enough there is no uh greater tolerance
[2:39:03] than the tolerance that this woman shows
[2:39:06] to anyone except those who stand against
[2:39:10] her if you stand against that system you
[2:39:13] become blood in her cup she just murders
[2:39:16] her
[2:39:18] own oh over 60 million over one period
[2:39:22] of church history 60
[2:39:24] million she murdered her own some of
[2:39:29] them members of her own
[2:39:32] Society but they had a little difference
[2:39:34] of
[2:39:35] opinion men that said wait a minute the
[2:39:38] just shall live by faith chased hunted
[2:39:42] she would have killed Martin Luther if
[2:39:44] she could have she did Kill many we have
[2:39:48] the fox book of Martyrs we can read the
[2:39:51] story of how anybody that said I think
[2:39:54] baptism ought to be another way or like
[2:39:57] youus who stood before the council and
[2:40:00] said I believe something has been added
[2:40:02] to the holy
[2:40:08] RIT like like other men of Faith who
[2:40:10] stood up and said wait a minute I think
[2:40:12] we have falsely interpreted what this
[2:40:14] scripture says and and the answer has
[2:40:17] always been the same away with you
[2:40:20] some to the prison some to the dungeon
[2:40:23] some to their death stretched
[2:40:28] apart not medieval tyrants and Kings
[2:40:33] priests you tell me
[2:40:35] Bishops religious
[2:40:38] men turn the
[2:40:41] crank to pull them
[2:40:43] apart women's bellies cut open and
[2:40:46] unborn babies snatched from their wombs
[2:40:49] sulfur burned inside of a woman's
[2:40:52] body because she had some thought some
[2:40:58] understanding that was different than
[2:41:01] this
[2:41:04] system you must just be making all this
[2:41:06] up it's just craziness all you have to
[2:41:09] do is open up your mind and read a
[2:41:10] little bit of history and you'll find
[2:41:13] out it wasn't communism that did all of
[2:41:16] this it was religion
[2:41:20] it was this woman she was drinking the
[2:41:23] blood of the martyrs over 60 million at
[2:41:25] one time we don't know the total amount
[2:41:28] but some people say that it would be
[2:41:30] upwards of 200 million people and maybe
[2:41:35] more that this church system has
[2:41:39] murdered some of them for more serious
[2:41:42] offenses some of them for something as
[2:41:44] simple as saying I have had a personal
[2:41:47] relationship with Jesus Christ
[2:41:50] baptized by immersion in his
[2:41:53] name we can't afford for you to have a
[2:41:56] different opinion because then you would
[2:41:58] under undermine the structure of the
[2:42:02] holy church the only church they say
[2:42:04] when the Catholics when that movement
[2:42:07] when that system talks about uh
[2:42:09] ecumenicalism and bringing Faith
[2:42:11] together they don't mean you believe
[2:42:13] what you believe I believe what I
[2:42:14] believe will come together no no no no
[2:42:17] they mean you believe what I believe
[2:42:20] you may be Baptist now you may be
[2:42:23] Pentecostal now but if you want true
[2:42:25] salvation you've got to come this way be
[2:42:28] all right if it was a Bible way if it
[2:42:29] was a bloody way if it was a scriptural
[2:42:31] way you read about lent in the Bible
[2:42:34] anybody read about Ash Wednesday in the
[2:42:39] Bible anybody read about the blessing of
[2:42:42] the dogs and animals during Lent and
[2:42:45] going to the priest on Ash Wednesday and
[2:42:47] having a
[2:42:49] cross put on your
[2:42:51] forehead I never read that in the Bible
[2:42:54] did you you ever read about going in a
[2:42:56] little box and confessing your sins to a
[2:42:59] priest I never read that you ever read
[2:43:01] about having a little bracelet on with
[2:43:03] bunch of beads and you count through
[2:43:05] those beads and and and you do that
[2:43:07] enough you'll find favor and you repeat
[2:43:09] some slogan Hail Mary Mother of God full
[2:43:12] of grace and truth it's a lie from the
[2:43:13] beginning Mary's not the mother of God
[2:43:15] God has no mother
[2:43:19] just let me get this out of my
[2:43:21] system so I don't have to do it every
[2:43:23] week for here on
[2:43:24] now it it goes on and on and on they
[2:43:28] don't just believe that that little
[2:43:29] communion cracker in your mouth
[2:43:31] represents the body of Christ they
[2:43:32] believe that it's literally
[2:43:34] trans
[2:43:36] transformed into the flesh
[2:43:40] body so that when you swallow you're not
[2:43:45] swallowing flour and water you're
[2:43:47] swallowing the body of Christ
[2:43:51] and you're drinking not wine that
[2:43:52] represents his blood you're drinking his
[2:43:55] blood which is an
[2:44:00] Abomination life is in the
[2:44:03] blood you don't have to have it my my my
[2:44:06] what a phony representation of how to
[2:44:08] get the Life of Christ in you just get
[2:44:10] the Holy Ghost just do what Mary did
[2:44:13] just do what Mary to Mary you love so
[2:44:15] Mary you love Mary you pray to Mary you
[2:44:18] worship Mary then do what Mary did Mary
[2:44:23] was commanded to go up and get the Holy
[2:44:25] Ghost just like the rest of
[2:44:28] them she had to have the Holy Ghost too
[2:44:32] amen I need to move
[2:44:37] on there's so much about her that
[2:44:39] influences us even
[2:44:42] today Steeples
[2:44:45] and these crosses with round
[2:44:49] Moon
[2:44:51] shapes on them representing the Holy
[2:44:54] Eucharist
[2:44:58] and kneelers and last rights and signs
[2:45:03] of the Cross and all of none of it
[2:45:08] absolutely none of it in the
[2:45:13] Bible and yet it's the largest group of
[2:45:20] Christians in the world are there good
[2:45:22] people there there are good people
[2:45:24] everywhere but to ignore the evil of the
[2:45:30] system because there are good people
[2:45:32] there would be doing them a
[2:45:35] disservice I saw this woman drunk with
[2:45:37] the blood of the Saints I'm hurrying and
[2:45:39] with the blood of uh the martyrs of
[2:45:41] Jesus and when I saw I wonder with great
[2:45:43] admiration let's read on quickly I got
[2:45:45] to get it somewhere and the angel said
[2:45:46] unto me where didst thou Marvel I will
[2:45:49] tell the mystery I will tell thee The
[2:45:51] Mystery of the woman and of the Beast
[2:45:52] that carrieth her which hath the seven
[2:45:54] heads and 10 horns the Beast that thou
[2:45:58] sawest was and is and is not sawest was
[2:46:02] and is not excuse me he was and is not
[2:46:05] and shall Ascend out of the bottomless
[2:46:07] pit and go into predition and they that
[2:46:10] dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose
[2:46:12] names were not written in the Book of
[2:46:13] Life from the foundation of the world
[2:46:15] when they behold the Beast that was and
[2:46:19] is not and yet is
[2:46:23] mysterious isn't it and here is the mind
[2:46:26] which ha wisdom the seven heads are
[2:46:29] seven mountains on which the woman
[2:46:33] sth this is most likely not speaking
[2:46:35] about
[2:46:39] Colorado the only other city other than
[2:46:42] one in
[2:46:43] Colorado that sits on Seven Hills is the
[2:46:47] city of Rome
[2:46:49] so the scripture
[2:46:51] identified so many years ago the very
[2:46:55] location of where this Beast would be
[2:46:58] and where this horish woman would make
[2:47:00] her
[2:47:01] home powerful you didn't even need a
[2:47:04] prophet to see that you needed a prophet
[2:47:07] for many other things but not
[2:47:08] particularly for that on which the woman
[2:47:11] sth uh then there are seven Kings I wish
[2:47:14] we had time five are fallen and one is
[2:47:17] and the other is not yet come and when
[2:47:19] cometh he must continue a short space
[2:47:21] now we can talk about these things
[2:47:23] another time in another series I read
[2:47:26] them simply because of the word
[2:47:28] Abominations means in the Old Testament
[2:47:30] something God hates means in the New
[2:47:32] Testament something that God
[2:47:36] hates now this is not my subject but can
[2:47:38] I give you a quote that's speaking about
[2:47:41] abomination but it's not
[2:47:45] particularly um
[2:47:51] it's talking about
[2:47:53] Pride but it uh is in my notes and I
[2:47:58] didn't want to spend too much time
[2:48:00] developing the thought can I just kind
[2:48:01] of throw it out there sure you can
[2:48:03] Pastor you worked hard to pull this
[2:48:06] together no
[2:48:08] no 182 we have seen a star oh brother
[2:48:12] sister how nice it would be if each one
[2:48:15] of you if each one of us me
[2:48:19] brother man said
[2:48:20] me wonder why he said
[2:48:23] me wonder why he put himself in there
[2:48:27] because he was also falling a little bit
[2:48:28] victim to the very thing he
[2:48:31] condemned somebody said that's a hateful
[2:48:33] thing to say was it hateful for the
[2:48:35] Bible to record that John admired the
[2:48:38] woman that sat there on that Beast or
[2:48:41] was that just reality reality it wasn't
[2:48:43] that he wanted to worship her but he
[2:48:45] sure was intrigued
[2:48:49] it's it's not totally out of my grid
[2:48:53] that someone could become enamored
[2:48:55] temporarily interested in something that
[2:48:59] they shouldn't be interested in has it
[2:49:01] ever happened to
[2:49:02] you he said I I I I just if each one of
[2:49:06] us
[2:49:07] me if each one of us could lay aside all
[2:49:10] this your Christmas
[2:49:13] tinsil see quit all the swapping gifts
[2:49:16] one with another all of this what do you
[2:49:18] call it
[2:49:19] nonsense of the world and
[2:49:23] just that's why I stuck it in here when
[2:49:25] I was first star in this
[2:49:28] series take off our pride and lay it
[2:49:32] down now this is why message Believers
[2:49:36] are running back to this
[2:49:39] stuff
[2:49:43] Pride it's real simple it used to not
[2:49:47] matter that we were the only ones that
[2:49:48] didn't
[2:49:50] but it matters
[2:49:52] now it used to didn't matter that our
[2:49:54] women weren't painted up but it matters
[2:49:58] now so they don't use eyes
[2:50:01] Shadow they just put lots of colored
[2:50:03] cream on their
[2:50:06] faces I was just recently in a gathering
[2:50:09] where there were many
[2:50:12] Believers and I don't know that there
[2:50:14] were
[2:50:15] 30 women in that great big crowd of
[2:50:18] brothers and sisters who weren't
[2:50:23] painted long hair some of it twisted and
[2:50:26] dyed and tied
[2:50:30] and permed and squirmed
[2:50:35] and didn't look real didn't look
[2:50:40] natural but that wasn't they they were
[2:50:42] all pretty in line with that but but I
[2:50:46] marveled I I grieved it greatly affected
[2:50:50] me and affects me to this
[2:50:52] moment why in the world after all these
[2:50:55] years of knowing the truth would would
[2:50:57] we start going back and picking up those
[2:50:59] things I know this is on the internet I
[2:51:01] know people will hear this has not ever
[2:51:03] been a part of your uh Faith it's never
[2:51:05] been a part of who you are but for us
[2:51:07] it's been a part of of our identity for
[2:51:09] a long long time and we you know we uh
[2:51:12] say that we believe that this Prophet
[2:51:14] you know that that he was right on had
[2:51:17] the right interpretation of the word etc
[2:51:19] etc some people say he was an extension
[2:51:21] of the word of God I don't say that but
[2:51:24] some people do some people say
[2:51:25] infallible some people say uh every word
[2:51:28] out of his mouth thus sayith the Lord
[2:51:30] etc etc etc and those same people are
[2:51:33] the ones who now put the color on and
[2:51:37] fix up all the flaws and run for all the
[2:51:41] Christmas and and here he identified I
[2:51:44] didn't understand this years ago I now
[2:51:45] do why he would say such a thing like
[2:51:48] this but now I understand it and just
[2:51:50] take off our
[2:51:52] pride and lay it down and stop the thing
[2:51:56] underfoot say Lord Jesus guide me to
[2:51:59] that Perfect Light amen now if that was
[2:52:02] all we could just say Amen we don't do
[2:52:04] it anyway no need to even mention that
[2:52:05] but he said watch something Supernatural
[2:52:08] happen the holy spirit will come in a
[2:52:10] phenomenal way so I'd like to say to
[2:52:12] anyone who hears this uh who has once
[2:52:15] stood against these kinds of things
[2:52:17] which by the way are directly connected
[2:52:19] to this Mystery
[2:52:22] Woman it is it is it is
[2:52:26] undeniable that Christmas is an
[2:52:28] extension of that and her
[2:52:32] system and we used to stand against it
[2:52:35] but now we're doing it for the kitties
[2:52:37] and now even brother brandom gave candy
[2:52:39] and now even he had a tree and
[2:52:41] now thank y'all for my suit and now we
[2:52:45] hear all those things well here's what
[2:52:46] he said wouldn't it be wonderful each
[2:52:48] one of us could lay aside all this
[2:52:50] Christmas tensil you one of us us
[2:52:54] me and lay our pride
[2:52:56] down do I have a few more minutes thank
[2:52:58] you I'm almost
[2:53:00] done if I haven't squirmed you I'm
[2:53:03] fixing to squirm
[2:53:05] you Deuteronomy 22 and5 would you put
[2:53:08] that
[2:53:10] up we don't have to saying we don't have
[2:53:13] to worship we don't have to pray for you
[2:53:14] we can just go home
[2:53:19] if you're in a
[2:53:22] hurry but we do have to get
[2:53:25] this so there are many things in the Old
[2:53:28] Testament God said don't do that don't
[2:53:29] do that don't do that don't do that
[2:53:30] don't do that don't do that do this do
[2:53:33] this do this do
[2:53:34] this some of them we don't even know how
[2:53:36] to
[2:53:38] interpret we don't even know how to how
[2:53:41] to to do them or not do
[2:53:44] them because in order to figure it out
[2:53:46] we would have to go to the oral
[2:53:48] tradition and man's interpretation and
[2:53:50] I'm not I'm not going to do that I'm not
[2:53:51] going to go to the to the talmud I'm not
[2:53:54] going to the oral tradition like some
[2:53:56] people do to try to figure it all out
[2:53:59] because that's not
[2:54:01] Vindicated it was opinion may be right
[2:54:04] may not be
[2:54:09] right so some things we wouldn't even
[2:54:11] know how to do if we thought we were
[2:54:12] supposed to do them and that's why you
[2:54:14] see all this
[2:54:16] weirdness everybody trying to figure it
[2:54:18] out for themselves but there's one thing
[2:54:20] we can know that God didn't say those
[2:54:21] things were
[2:54:26] Abomination if he said it was an
[2:54:28] Abomination is something he hates
[2:54:30] something detestable disgusting to him
[2:54:33] that can't change a woman the
[2:54:38] woman shall not wear that which
[2:54:40] pertaineth unto a man neither shall a
[2:54:43] man put on a woman's garment for all
[2:54:46] that do so
[2:54:54] before it was the it was the doing that
[2:54:58] God said he
[2:55:01] hated proud look I hate it when people
[2:55:06] behave proudly so Discord that's a doing
[2:55:10] Swift to M
[2:55:12] doing do we have to go back and get them
[2:55:14] all doing doing doing God said I hate
[2:55:16] that now he says
[2:55:18] says those who do this are detestable
[2:55:23] disgusting an Abomination to me that's
[2:55:26] serious business folks you you can throw
[2:55:29] it out and call it oldfashioned if you
[2:55:31] want to but that's pretty serious
[2:55:32] business I I'm I'm just I'm not saying
[2:55:35] more than what this word is saying a
[2:55:37] woman shall not wear that which say that
[2:55:40] word with me pertaineth unto a man
[2:55:42] neither neither don't let the man off
[2:55:45] the hook neither shall a man put on a
[2:55:47] woman's garment for all that do so are
[2:55:51] an Abomination all that do so are
[2:55:54] Abomination unto the Lord thy God
[2:55:57] morally
[2:55:59] disgusting in his
[2:56:01] sight now I believe that from that
[2:56:04] scripture to take it through the
[2:56:05] scripture that's his character that's
[2:56:07] part of God's character if he said I
[2:56:09] love it that's part of his character if
[2:56:10] he says he hates it that's part of his
[2:56:12] character so God is saying I I despise
[2:56:16] when women here
[2:56:22] masculine I despise when a woman is
[2:56:26] wearing something possessing something
[2:56:29] doing something that pertains to a man
[2:56:31] wait a minute you said you said doing
[2:56:34] something well we have to to be
[2:56:37] fair because the key word here is not
[2:56:40] Abomination that's powerful enough isn't
[2:56:43] it the key word here is even more
[2:56:46] convicting the key word is protect pinth
[2:56:48] I want everyone to say the word
[2:56:50] pertaineth that's a key
[2:56:53] word now I don't generally refer to
[2:56:57] AI for my Bible
[2:56:59] study but I thought this would be an
[2:57:01] interesting search I'm going to ask
[2:57:03] artificial intelligence to tell me if
[2:57:07] pertaineth in Deuteronomy 22 and5 I gave
[2:57:10] it the Hebrew
[2:57:13] word which is
[2:57:16] KH if it was to be taken literal is it a
[2:57:20] literal word
[2:57:22] oh I happen to have its
[2:57:26] answer understanding
[2:57:29] pertaineth the word pertaineth in this
[2:57:31] verse comes from the Hebrew term Ki
[2:57:34] which corresponds to Strong's number
[2:57:37] 3627 in Hebrew Khali broadly means
[2:57:40] vessel Implement utensil or article it
[2:57:44] refers to a tangible object remember
[2:57:48] what the word is
[2:57:50] pertaineth it refers to a tangible
[2:57:53] object or item that belongs to or is
[2:57:56] associated with someone or
[2:57:59] something it has been translated stuff
[2:58:03] weapons vessels Jewels instruments
[2:58:07] garments
[2:58:10] dresses and even
[2:58:13] Furniture
[2:58:14] there the word pertaineth can be used
[2:58:19] concerning even
[2:58:21] Furniture in context of the Tabernacle
[2:58:24] or the temple because remember that was
[2:58:27] furniture that God designed to be used
[2:58:29] for excuse me specific
[2:58:33] purpose so the word pertaineth can mean
[2:58:36] a weapon the modern church when they
[2:58:39] interpret this verse when they explain
[2:58:41] to us that it doesn't apply to us today
[2:58:44] they choose one of those words that's
[2:58:46] translated in English
[2:58:51] weapons uh
[2:58:54] armor and they'll tell you that that
[2:58:56] verse refers to the shame of a woman
[2:58:59] wearing the armor of a soldier who is a
[2:59:04] man well that would work that way
[2:59:08] but not the other
[2:59:10] way then what would the man how could
[2:59:13] the man be wearing the armor of a woman
[2:59:18] that would only be one gender do you
[2:59:20] understand my point they forget to tell
[2:59:23] you that it doesn't just mean that word
[2:59:25] pertain it is the is the kicker here not
[2:59:27] the word Abomination the word pertaineth
[2:59:30] is the kicker here because that can mean
[2:59:33] associated
[2:59:36] with
[2:59:40] pertaineth it is an Abomination for a
[2:59:42] man to wear that which pertain it a
[2:59:45] woman to wear that which pertain it let
[2:59:47] let's read the verse one more time and
[2:59:49] move a woman shall not wear that which
[2:59:52] is
[2:59:53] associated unto a
[2:59:58] man that could be a lot of things
[3:00:01] pertaining neither shall a man put on a
[3:00:04] woman's
[3:00:05] garment for all that do so are an
[3:00:08] Abomination unto the Lord thy
[3:00:12] God let's read on in the context of
[3:00:15] Deuteronomy 22 and5 k specifically
[3:00:18] denotes clothing or items typically worn
[3:00:22] by men how could you say that because it
[3:00:25] says
[3:00:27] garment that's also an important word
[3:00:29] but not nearly as important as
[3:00:31] pertaineth are you with
[3:00:33] me so I ask the
[3:00:36] question how literal is pertaineth in
[3:00:41] the Hebrew in this verse and in this
[3:00:44] verse pertaineth is quite literal
[3:00:48] it refers directly to physical objects
[3:00:51] namely garments or articles of clothing
[3:00:54] designed
[3:00:58] for or associated with a specific
[3:01:03] gender listen to me
[3:01:05] Church the command is clear and
[3:01:09] practical women now listen I'm not going
[3:01:13] to use AI for my go-to reference
[3:01:18] but I had had fun a couple
[3:01:20] times this was one of my
[3:01:23] times the one thing I know about it it
[3:01:25] can be wrong it's according to how you
[3:01:28] ask I ask considered this word Hebrew
[3:01:34] now in English how literal is the
[3:01:37] context this is not a theologian opinion
[3:01:41] this is absolutely factual from the very
[3:01:44] meaning of the word the command is clear
[3:01:47] and PR practical women are not to wear
[3:01:50] clothing that belongs to men and men are
[3:01:53] not to wear women's
[3:01:55] garments well this word belong doesn't
[3:01:58] mean possessed by again it means
[3:02:01] pertaineth to this reflects a concrete
[3:02:05] instruction about maintaining distinct
[3:02:09] gender
[3:02:11] appearances which was significant in
[3:02:13] ancient Israel Society for preserving
[3:02:16] social and religious order so from that
[3:02:20] verse of scripture we can conclude that
[3:02:26] crossdressing is an Abomination to
[3:02:29] God is that right now they say well in
[3:02:33] the Bible they didn't wear dresses and
[3:02:35] pants that's right not not really but
[3:02:38] sort
[3:02:40] of because men did often wear
[3:02:44] breaches underneath their robes
[3:02:48] sometimes uh associated with with a
[3:02:51] garment sort of like a girdle but having
[3:02:55] legs so sometimes the English translates
[3:02:58] it girdle but anybody that knows
[3:03:00] anything about oldfashioned women's
[3:03:01] girdles
[3:03:02] even had legs not maybe to the ground
[3:03:06] but but
[3:03:08] legs the the priest wore them athletes
[3:03:13] would wear them in fact it was part of
[3:03:16] the Garment that was used to gird up the
[3:03:18] loins to pull the robe up and to tuck
[3:03:22] in so a lot of the time under a man's
[3:03:26] robe there were garments that Associated
[3:03:29] that man as a man well you couldn't see
[3:03:33] it if it was under his robe that's right
[3:03:34] and that's why they use different
[3:03:36] styles different
[3:03:38] colors different sashes ropes and
[3:03:43] ornamentation women's being more ornate
[3:03:46] a man's being more simple and the only
[3:03:50] blurring of the lines was with royalty
[3:03:52] because the king wanted everybody to
[3:03:54] know how wealthy he was so he oftentimes
[3:03:57] borrowed designs from the women to make
[3:03:59] himself which according to scripture
[3:04:01] would be an
[3:04:03] Abomination
[3:04:04] pertaineth the word that I want you to
[3:04:07] carry home with you today is
[3:04:10] pertaineth doesn't have to be just
[3:04:15] slacks it doesn't just have to be
[3:04:19] genes the Bible said that God
[3:04:22] abhors this concept of women wearing
[3:04:27] garments that pertain to a
[3:04:33] man that could be dress slacks or
[3:04:37] trousers or shorts or it could be
[3:04:43] uh did I say blue jeans pants they call
[3:04:47] them now the women will tell you I get
[3:04:50] my pants in the women's section that's
[3:04:51] not the problem the problem is not what
[3:04:54] section you buy in because remember we
[3:04:57] have genderless bathrooms now so it
[3:05:00] doesn't matter it's not the department
[3:05:01] you buy it in it's what it pertains to
[3:05:04] what do you think what is it associated
[3:05:06] with which
[3:05:07] gender you see we now have a a president
[3:05:10] who said there's only two
[3:05:13] genders and the Bible said there should
[3:05:15] be distinction between the two
[3:05:18] in a lot of things including the things
[3:05:20] they wear amen so it's not just the
[3:05:23] dress slacks or the jeans dungared they
[3:05:26] used to call them or what my granny call
[3:05:28] britches and I like to say it that way
[3:05:30] britches it's more than that it's the
[3:05:34] pajamas oh let's see how quiet it gets
[3:05:37] if jeans pertain to a man so do pajamas
[3:05:41] pertain to a
[3:05:42] man oh
[3:05:44] my oh my sweatpants
[3:05:51] I don't think it's any of anybody's
[3:05:52] business what I wear at
[3:05:55] home it is if it pertains to a
[3:05:58] man I grieve when I see these little
[3:06:01] girls in
[3:06:03] britches some of you put put your girls
[3:06:06] in them I don't I don't agree with it I
[3:06:08] I'm embarrassed by it and
[3:06:10] offended there's no way in this world
[3:06:12] that you can say that doesn't pertain it
[3:06:14] pertains and if you're never going to
[3:06:16] take a picture of them then perhaps when
[3:06:18] they're older they'll forget but you are
[3:06:21] going to and they're going to see it and
[3:06:23] they're going to wonder and they're
[3:06:24] going to
[3:06:25] ask why it was okay and what what age
[3:06:28] should it
[3:06:29] change I see the age getting higher
[3:06:33] and somebody said well don't you want to
[3:06:36] teach a little girl to be modest yes and
[3:06:37] that has to start from the beginning and
[3:06:39] when they're toddler when they're just
[3:06:41] crawling around they don't understand
[3:06:43] holding their dress down you just have
[3:06:46] to teach them when they're old enough to
[3:06:48] understand but you don't have to dress
[3:06:50] them in something that pertains to a
[3:06:53] man you you don't have to say I don't
[3:06:56] even care I won't even be offended if
[3:06:58] you don't even say amen I won't be
[3:07:00] offended I just I'm my responsibility is
[3:07:03] preach what's the word saying now In
[3:07:05] fairness let me give you a quote where
[3:07:08] brother brandom said he didn't know what
[3:07:09] to say about it just so you'll
[3:07:12] understand and then we're going to go
[3:07:13] we're going to go we're going to rejoice
[3:07:15] and we're going to go we're not going to
[3:07:16] worry about it but we are going to say
[3:07:18] we heard the word
[3:07:22] pertaineth we're going to say that we
[3:07:24] understood now from scripture that it
[3:07:26] means can be associated with and it
[3:07:29] doesn't even have to be necessarily just
[3:07:31] a piece of clothing it can also be some
[3:07:33] other item that is associated with a
[3:07:36] man or some other item associated with a
[3:07:39] woman and then you just take that like a
[3:07:41] like a
[3:07:44] merse like a man's purse
[3:07:47] is all right for a man to have a bag to
[3:07:49] carry his things in but it shouldn't be
[3:07:51] shouldn't be made like a woman's purse
[3:07:56] hello I sure wish you to let us cut off
[3:07:59] the stream I don't I don't I don't
[3:08:00] really
[3:08:03] care questions and answers let me get
[3:08:05] this one in questions and answers and
[3:08:08] women 118 you dress like a woman and man
[3:08:12] you dress like a man don't try to be a
[3:08:13] and wear women's clothes and women
[3:08:15] don't you try to be masculine and wear
[3:08:17] man's clothes because God don't want you
[3:08:19] to do that the Bible condemns it there
[3:08:21] it is amen doesn't matter if it has
[3:08:23] flowers on it sheep
[3:08:25] clouds tulips uh uh what else can little
[3:08:29] elephants doesn't matter does the
[3:08:32] Garment pertain to a man if it does then
[3:08:34] we ought to be very careful how we allow
[3:08:38] it in our
[3:08:40] families because if God says that this
[3:08:43] cross dressing and women wearing things
[3:08:46] that pertain to men and vice Versa that
[3:08:48] something he hates because he wants
[3:08:49] there to be such a distinct line in the
[3:08:52] genders which is even more important
[3:08:55] today that we have been forced to try to
[3:08:57] figure out
[3:08:59] pronouns and what do they call it binary
[3:09:02] and what's the other term they use for
[3:09:04] genderless
[3:09:07] genderless you really think somebody's
[3:09:09] walking around without a
[3:09:11] [Music]
[3:09:13] gender why even an elephant has a a g a
[3:09:17] gender a lion has a
[3:09:19] gender I think most
[3:09:22] bugs have genders but there are people
[3:09:24] that don't have genders or they're
[3:09:26] fluffies or Furies or whatever they are
[3:09:28] don't you understand it's a
[3:09:31] spirit there's the reason why the Bible
[3:09:33] said women should have long hair men
[3:09:35] should not have long hair it goes to the
[3:09:38] same reasoning it needs their needs to
[3:09:41] be a clear
[3:09:44] distinction in the genders God does
[3:09:47] doesn't like that line blurred and if
[3:09:48] it's blurred he calls it an
[3:09:50] Abomination are you with me I'll skip
[3:09:53] that one but I'll finish with this one
[3:09:55] this is the one that that the women use
[3:09:56] to wear their sweat britches sweatpants
[3:09:58] and and put their children in pajamas
[3:10:00] and they do it because Mama wears
[3:10:03] them and they say things like well it's
[3:10:05] cold weather you know it's cold and a
[3:10:07] woman then get you a skirt to the ground
[3:10:09] and put something underneath it that we
[3:10:11] can't see and call that your
[3:10:14] underwear but don't shine it for other
[3:10:16] people to see it you see brother
[3:10:19] brandham said about those women uh the
[3:10:22] Scandal skirt one day I'm going to teach
[3:10:24] one day I'm going to teach on the
[3:10:25] Scandal skirt I have pictures but the
[3:10:29] Scandal skirt that brother brandham
[3:10:30] cried out against so much uh so many
[3:10:33] times was a skirt that had little
[3:10:37] leggings that came out from underneath
[3:10:40] the
[3:10:43] skirt it the skirt was made in such a
[3:10:46] way that it was was naturally hiked up
[3:10:50] and these little leggy things were there
[3:10:52] and I've got pictures of them and her
[3:10:54] name was Clara Bo and brother brandham
[3:10:56] talked about her and she was the one who
[3:10:57] made him famous and brother brandham
[3:10:59] said they're rightly named Scandal
[3:11:02] skirt cried out against them just like
[3:11:05] he did the split tail
[3:11:07] skirts cried out against them because he
[3:11:09] felt like that it was a
[3:11:13] compromise and pertain those those
[3:11:16] little now I don't think that's pertain
[3:11:17] to a man but those are leggy things that
[3:11:20] were hanging out the bottom they pertain
[3:11:23] to a man the words pertain you're just
[3:11:26] preaching your conviction am I I thought
[3:11:29] I was I thought I was just preaching
[3:11:30] what the what the scripture said excuse
[3:11:32] me excuse me if I'm out of order I
[3:11:35] thought I was just giving you what the
[3:11:36] scripture said now this shows you a
[3:11:38] prophet that know everything and thank
[3:11:40] God for one who commit he
[3:11:42] didn't questions and answers of
[3:11:45] paragraph 270 question 367 and we're
[3:11:47] going going to be hard to have an
[3:11:50] anointed prayer altar call service
[3:11:52] worship service after
[3:11:55] this the question was I'd like to ask a
[3:11:58] question number one is lady's pajamas is
[3:12:02] a lady's pajamas pertaining to a man's
[3:12:04] garment I'm going to be real honest with
[3:12:05] you I don't know why in the world she
[3:12:08] even asked such a question like this in
[3:12:15] 1964 but she did
[3:12:19] so brother brandham
[3:12:20] who didn't even like to talk about
[3:12:23] ladies
[3:12:28] hoery he was so unfamiliar with the
[3:12:31] cycle of a woman's
[3:12:33] body because it wasn't discussed it's
[3:12:36] not like it is today where everybody
[3:12:38] knows everybody else's
[3:12:44] time women didn't talk about it in those
[3:12:47] days it was a reality but it wasn't
[3:12:49] something it was talked about like oh
[3:12:52] it's that time of the month for me and
[3:12:54] you know that's why I'm so grouchy and
[3:12:57] they they just didn't talk about it and
[3:12:58] that's why brother brandham said some
[3:12:59] things that are just incorrect
[3:13:01] concerning that for instance saying that
[3:13:04] the only time that a woman's body
[3:13:06] released those eggs was with stimulation
[3:13:08] and that's just not the truth it happens
[3:13:10] every month and those eggs that are not
[3:13:12] fertilized are flushed out of her body
[3:13:14] in a cycle that God created if I'm
[3:13:16] embarrassing you I'm very sorry sorry
[3:13:17] but it's a very natural thing now and we
[3:13:19] need to speak it just like it is but
[3:13:21] brother Bram didn't understand that
[3:13:22] because it wasn't something that was
[3:13:24] talked about and he literally thought
[3:13:26] the only time that happened
[3:13:28] was and he found out that wasn't the way
[3:13:30] it was maybe maybe when he got to Heaven
[3:13:33] maybe somebody told him later maybe his
[3:13:34] wife told him I don't
[3:13:36] know he said boy don't tell me they
[3:13:39] can't ask you some
[3:13:45] burners he said I don't
[3:13:49] know I don't
[3:13:53] know did you know brother bam never used
[3:13:56] the word
[3:13:58] pertaineth when referring to Deuteronomy
[3:14:03] 22:5 he just said woman shouldn't wear
[3:14:05] that which pertains shouldn't wear a
[3:14:07] man's garment and vice versa he didn't
[3:14:09] use that word pertaineth when referring
[3:14:12] to the Garment he used that new
[3:14:15] testament pertaineth unto God or what
[3:14:17] whatever that verse of scripture is he
[3:14:19] never used that word in association with
[3:14:21] Deuteronomy 22 and5 that wasn't
[3:14:23] something that really stuck out to him
[3:14:25] in such a way that he made it a part of
[3:14:27] his preaching so no wonder he came and
[3:14:29] said I don't know I'm just going to let
[3:14:31] you know uh I'm going to let you do the
[3:14:33] deciding of that you shouldn't be
[3:14:34] parading around before people with a
[3:14:36] moan I know
[3:14:37] that so that way it would be but in the
[3:14:42] in going to bed you see all those dots
[3:14:44] and hyphens and that is a man on the
[3:14:49] spot that's a man who's not entirely
[3:14:51] comfortable with the
[3:14:53] question here I am talking about what
[3:14:55] some other man's wife is wearing to bed
[3:14:58] you know he saw it that
[3:15:00] way I don't I don't uh have that same
[3:15:04] kind of
[3:15:07] feeling he said so that it would be but
[3:15:09] in the in going to bed I I I don't know
[3:15:15] he said I'm going to have to back up on
[3:15:16] that one I told you I'd be honest if I
[3:15:18] didn't know I'm not going to put my own
[3:15:21] thought about it and I wouldn't want to
[3:15:23] do it that either he said all right
[3:15:26] unless you want my own
[3:15:28] thought what about all those people who
[3:15:30] say his opinion meant more to me than
[3:15:33] all right well then let's hear his
[3:15:36] opinion he said unless you want my own
[3:15:38] thought if you want that I'll tell
[3:15:41] you now remember it isn't it it this
[3:15:45] this could be a million miles
[3:15:49] wrong I think I I think it would look
[3:15:53] nice to have a night down
[3:15:59] on that's his opinion he said might have
[3:16:02] been more scriptural than he realized
[3:16:05] because the word says
[3:16:07] pertaineth and you can't tell me that a
[3:16:10] pair of pants pertains to a man but a
[3:16:13] pair of pants on a woman at night does
[3:16:15] not pertain
[3:16:17] to a man it's pertain it's not the
[3:16:21] purpose of the Garment it's not the
[3:16:23] designer of the Garment it's not the
[3:16:26] print on the
[3:16:27] Garment it's
[3:16:30] pertain whether you believe that or not
[3:16:32] it all goes back to
[3:16:36] Pride he said I I can't tell you that uh
[3:16:39] because I couldn't back it up he
[3:16:41] couldn't back it up what if somebody
[3:16:44] can what if somebody can look at
[3:16:47] Deuteronomy 22:5 and say emphatically
[3:16:51] that using just the language of the
[3:16:54] scripture the word
[3:16:59] pertaineth could mean garment it could
[3:17:03] even mean curling
[3:17:08] iron a man shouldn't be using a curling
[3:17:15] iron I don't have anything is curling
[3:17:17] iron Ben stop using a curling
[3:17:20] iron that's your problem that's what's
[3:17:22] happened if you quit using that curling
[3:17:24] iron it'll all grow
[3:17:26] back I mean I said that cuz he was doing
[3:17:29] this if a man were to use one he'd have
[3:17:32] to have long hair wouldn't he the Bible
[3:17:34] already
[3:17:35] said the Bible already said not for a
[3:17:38] man to have long hair so you can go with
[3:17:41] the quote I I I bless you you can go
[3:17:44] with the quote where brother said I
[3:17:45] don't know I I couldn't really say I'm
[3:17:46] not sure I'd be backing it up don't want
[3:17:48] to give you my opinion but if you really
[3:17:50] want my opinion I'll tell you I think it
[3:17:51] you'd look nicer than a night gown well
[3:17:53] he didn't mean somebody else's wife
[3:17:54] would look nice in a night gown he meant
[3:17:58] I think it would be nice for a woman to
[3:18:00] wear something that pertained to a woman
[3:18:04] a night gown instead of pajamas but he
[3:18:07] said I think I'd like I think it'd look
[3:18:09] nice and but I couldn't back it up
[3:18:11] couldn't back it up so now I'm going to
[3:18:13] leave it at that what if it could be
[3:18:14] backed up
[3:18:18] what if we have gotten to a place where
[3:18:20] we have used these things to mean
[3:18:22] something they don't even mean and when
[3:18:25] we go back and take a look at them they
[3:18:27] slap Us in the face and they mean more
[3:18:29] than what we ever realize they mean
[3:18:31] pertain
[3:18:32] itth the one thing I know is that God
[3:18:35] said even the very look of Pride I hate
[3:18:37] that and what is it that makes somebody
[3:18:40] want to try to go around the word Lord
[3:18:44] Jesus help us
[3:18:47] to take your word as your
[3:18:52] word if I've heard anybody's feelings I
[3:18:56] pray that they will soon
[3:18:59] heal let's stand musicians coming but I
[3:19:02] just simply don't have any AP I'm not I
[3:19:05] I just don't have one yet maybe I'll
[3:19:07] come in here Tuesday night with my
[3:19:08] shoulders all down and apologize for
[3:19:11] telling you the
[3:19:15] truth and if I do You' be sure to snap a
[3:19:20] picture it burns in
[3:19:23] me that line shouldn't be
[3:19:27] [Music]
[3:19:29] blurred it should not be
[3:19:31] blurred the gender line should not be
[3:19:34] blurred it should be
[3:19:39] distinct some things we can't even apply
[3:19:42] but if God said I hate that it can apply
[3:19:45] if he says I hate it he hates it and now
[3:19:48] we look around and we wonder why in the
[3:19:50] world these all these preachers preach
[3:19:52] those things way back then and now look
[3:19:55] at the mess the world is in and nobody
[3:19:58] seems to want to say it anymore it is
[3:20:01] what it is if Pride partners with
[3:20:05] offense it sure can set up a dangerous
[3:20:10] trap for a
[3:20:12] Believer yes you're right what you do in
[3:20:14] the privacy of your home is not up to
[3:20:18] me it's up to you your husband as a
[3:20:22] sister and
[3:20:26] God your husband may not
[3:20:29] care but the next question
[3:20:33] is does
[3:20:40] God I can't tell you what
[3:20:44] uh what the next generation will do
[3:20:46] about that because they all like to put
[3:20:49] these little britches you know first of
[3:20:50] all it started off as under the skirt
[3:20:52] like the like the
[3:20:54] apostolics you thought they were UPC
[3:20:57] because you see their leggings coming
[3:20:59] out from under their skirts and that
[3:21:00] that was that was tolerated to still
[3:21:04] is in the message people adopted that as
[3:21:07] their uniform as
[3:21:08] well and
[3:21:11] now for their little girls they would
[3:21:14] just put
[3:21:15] little uh tights or something like that
[3:21:18] on one thing but now it's pant
[3:21:22] suits it is you know I'm right Ruffles
[3:21:26] around the legs like that makes a
[3:21:29] difference Jackal
[3:21:32] lanterns little pants and little
[3:21:35] Ruffles candy canes and whatever else
[3:21:38] the world is interested
[3:21:40] in and now it's getting older and older
[3:21:42] and older and how in the world they're
[3:21:44] going to wrestle that thing if that girl
[3:21:46] gets old enough to be used to that how
[3:21:49] are they going to wrestle that away from
[3:21:50] her I don't understand if it pertains at
[3:21:54] 8 it pertains at eight
[3:21:58] months I have no judgment I have no
[3:22:00] condemnation for anybody that doesn't
[3:22:02] share that understanding but just know
[3:22:04] this it's more than my
[3:22:06] conviction it's what the scripture said
[3:22:10] pertaineth God help us
[3:22:13] woo Glory if you weren't looking you'd
[3:22:16] just
[3:22:17] got scared didn't
[3:22:19] you Lord I want to serve you I I didn't
[3:22:22] want to I didn't want to say that I I I
[3:22:27] really didn't and I thought there for a
[3:22:28] while I wouldn't even get to it because
[3:22:29] of
[3:22:31] time and then I knew that if I didn't
[3:22:33] get it off of
[3:22:35] me I'd have to call everybody back here
[3:22:37] tomorrow probably once you put something
[3:22:40] in there I I've got to cover it when I
[3:22:42] get to it and then we're going to move
[3:22:44] on Lord the one thing we don't want want
[3:22:46] to do is be we don't want to sww Discord
[3:22:49] among the brethren we don't want to have
[3:22:50] a lying tongue we don't want to have a
[3:22:52] proud look we we don't want to do
[3:22:54] anything that your word says that is
[3:22:56] detestable or something you abhor or
[3:23:00] something that you despise we don't want
[3:23:03] any part of it and probably there's so
[3:23:05] much more that should be addressed but
[3:23:08] Lord this is what you put on my heart so
[3:23:10] I ask that you will give us Grace no
[3:23:13] judgment let no family judge another
[3:23:15] family let no mother judge another
[3:23:18] mother let no Father Judge another
[3:23:20] father let it not be a a discussion at
[3:23:24] lunch to shame anybody but Lord let it
[3:23:27] be established that this seems to be
[3:23:30] what your word is saying to us and let
[3:23:33] us come back to our thoughts about
[3:23:37] Pride we just want to lay low before you
[3:23:39] as much as possible we want to be
[3:23:42] faithful at the end at the end I want to
[3:23:45] be a fa faithful man at the end I
[3:23:49] believe these Saints want to be faithful
[3:23:52] men and faithful women unto God are is
[3:23:55] this the most important thing we have to
[3:23:56] preach no no it's not a lot of this
[3:23:59] wasn't the most important thing but may
[3:24:02] be needful anyway give us Grace Lord to
[3:24:05] move forward in all things and love one
[3:24:08] another most of all when we come to
[3:24:11] worship you we want to have clean hands
[3:24:13] and a pure heart we don't want to be mad
[3:24:15] we don't want to be offended we don't
[3:24:17] want to be rude to one
[3:24:19] another we want to to show as much love
[3:24:23] as we possibly
[3:24:29] can I'm struck by the fact that that
[3:24:32] poish woman had all those jewels
[3:24:36] on just like we read in Isaiah
[3:24:39] 3 it's a look of
[3:24:43] pride May we be clean outside and inside
[3:24:47] may we be free from
[3:24:49] pride May we be humble before you not
[3:24:51] false humility but the real kind that
[3:24:54] says Lord if you can use anything you
[3:24:56] can use me most of all we we want to say
[3:25:00] we love you supremely above all things
[3:25:03] if there are those who believe us we we
[3:25:05] bless them in the name of Jesus Christ
[3:25:08] and uh we are thankful that they were
[3:25:10] here with us this morning we give you
[3:25:12] the honor and the praise and the glory
[3:25:14] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen

[3:25:19] need to you certainly can uh th for
[3:25:22] those of us is 2:21 for those of us who
