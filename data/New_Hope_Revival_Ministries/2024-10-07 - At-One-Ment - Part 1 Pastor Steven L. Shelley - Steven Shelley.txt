think of what he's done and where he's brought me from I've got so much to thank him for oh I've got so much to thank him for so much to praise him for you see he's been so good to [Music] me and when I think of what he's done and where he's brought me from I've got so much to thank him for would you stand together oh I've got so much to thank him for so much to praise him for you see he's been so

see you see he's been so good to me and when I think and where he brought me from I've got so much to thank him for just one last time and I've got so much to thank him for so much to pra prise him more you see well he's been so good to me and when I think of what he's done and where he's brought me from I've got so much to thank him for is that your testimony today you want to give the Lord another praise [Music] Hallelujah I don't know who ever told the church that any old praise will do but I'm not very fond of that person because that's not what the scripture teaches the Bible actually tells us to give God exuberant praise in Hebrew it tells us to lift up the highest praise to the King of Kings and the Lord of lords you may say a lot about us but I tell you what you can't say you can't say that there's not a people here who want to give God a high praise and I appreciate you this morning it's for him it's for him it's not for us you may be seated it's not for church we're not we're not rejoicing for church we're rejoicing for the King of Kings and the Lord of lords he's ever More Alive in my heart how many of you brought him with you to church when you came today you didn't meet him here you brought him you brought him here these little licks of fire when they get together brother bam said we're putting the pillar of fire back together then he divided himself on chavot on the day of Pentecost and now he's coming back together one great Pillar of Fire among the body of Christ we're very thankful for him and what he means to us today we've had wonderful Fellowship the last couple of days with the heern and family and just appreciated them so much and getting to know them and you know sometimes when you're meeting people for the first time it can be a little awkward uh but I'm just thankful that it wasn't that way because we're really blood related um I never even knew there were any Hein until I saw Kate on the stream one time and they and they said his name was heph and I said I've never never heard that name but yet we're related we we're kin folk because we're one blood we're one blood and it's not Shelly blood or heon blood or brandom blood or anybody it's his blood oh it wasn't the blood of a Jew or a gentile it wasn't the blood of a Greek or a Roman but it was God's own blood blood that he created specifically for the cause of redemption and that's the blood that's you know the word said you're not your own the life that you're living now is not your life you're now living his life it's not that human blood that's keeping you here no sir that's not enough because you die with the same blood you lived with even though the life is found in the blood but there is a blood that's keeping us keeping on good to see you in the house of the Lord today if you're in a hurry you're in the wrong Church Church you didn't know maybe but now you know today I'm I hate that em miss Emily is out she was in just a minute ago but today is RJ and Emily's sixth is it sixth sixth anniversary and she is just about in labor is she having anything can you say that out loud is that too much to say I just ask all kinds of questions it's coming if it's not here it's on the way she's about to deliver number three is that maybe three of 10 we don't know but may God give her special Grace special Grace to get through it and uh and come out on the other side with a with a healthy addition to their home what an anniversary present that is and today is kren's birthday is that right Kiren May are you 12 today tell her to move her head over this way so I can see her are you 12 today 13 13 years old oh I'm sorry Greg and Samantha she's a teenager now that's when the real life begins let's wish her a happy birthday [Applause] today if you think that shakes you let me tell you what shakes me tomorrow Monday October the 7th is our second our first daughter's uh birthday Olivia Zion she will be 21 how did that happen happy birthday darling love you 21 I remember being in Israel and getting messages from the Miller family in Missouri because sister Martha was delivering and they had a little bit of a time and but she got through it and God gave them their baby and he acts like he he he don't act like a baby but he acts like the baby of the family sometime I've been watching him and he's got the most amazing biblical psalmist name his name is jubile Lee Jubilee ain't that great and his birthday is coming up on Tuesday but I don't remember how many it is jubile can you tell me you you had to think about it you had to think about it did you that moving has really got your brain adle doesn't it how old are you going to be oh dear another teenager God bless you son then Thursday October the 10th is Sister Isabelle willam's birthday I don't know if she wants you to know how old she's going to be or not do you care to tell them she'll be 88 years old she rarely misses a service let's thank God for [Applause] her is that right and that would have been brother and sister tbo's wedding anniversary and we I just I just can't I this sounds real crazy but do you know how hard it is to unfriend somebody on Facebook when they pass away way do you know how many friends I have on social media that aren't here they're not posting much these days but they're there I just can't cut people out of my life that quick and so I think of it when I look at the calendar I think about their anniversary and uh that's also the day that Lily Grayson back there Lily Grayson yovic if I've got that right she turn is it six she turned six uh she's one of one of the crew with another one on the way Lily's kind of a special one let's give her a happy birthday love [Applause] you and then of course we will remember on Friday evening as the sun goes down we will remember that it is yam kapor on the lunar calendar and uh which is the day of atonement and that will be be all day Sunday and if anybody had anything to celebrate over atonement it'd be you and I we are fully redeemed we don't need another Lamb's blood we don't need another offering we we've got it it's ours and uh so brother uh Austin hodges's birthday is on the day of atonement it's on yam kapor and that Saturday of this week you mind to tell me how old you'll be 30 wow that's a lot you do know that uh according to Jewish tradition you need to fast on yam kapor so that means that on Friday evening an hour before the sun goes down you stop eating and then you don't eat again until there's three stars in the sky that can be seen with a naked eye on Saturday you're going to have the most amazing birthday you've ever had I know what you're thinking I'm glad I'm not a Jew but anyway God bless you amen if I missed you I certainly didn't mean to miss you we we also think about this week um when we look at the calendar I think about the fact that uh from Tuesday the 8th of October to to Thursday the 10th of October brother brandham was uh up in Sportsman's Hollow in Kentucky and he was hunting and and uh I heard him tell it just this week on tape and and he said I wasn't I wasn't asking God uh on my own he asked me he asked me what I wanted that's pretty powerful and by the power of the creative spoken word there was a a squirrel appeared not just once and U I was standing in in um the den room in Tucson many years ago it must have been about 1991 or '92 there was some visitors there I hate to tell this part but I always tell the whole story there were some sisters that were wanting to get some water out of the swimming pool because they thought that was brother brandom's swimming pool and they thought they'd take him some water home as though that was going to do some kind of you know there are Catholics around the message so brother George was very upset by it I was too and he said 'l sisters he said that's ridiculous but if you want to take a big Swig out of that swimming pool get all that chlorine down your throat go right ahead be my guest but he said that don't have nothing to do with brother brandham someone else was there on tour and they asked brother George they said that that took red red Kentucky squirrel there is that the squirrel that brother brandom spoke into existence and brother GE or just chuckled a little bit and he said no sister that's not the squirrel that's just to show foreign people who come here from other countries what a Kentucky squirrel looks like they don't look like our little pitiful Alabama squirrels they're big old red squirrels and she said well brother George she said what did Brother brandham and them do with the squirrel that he spoke into existence where there was no squirrel to be and she looked down he said he looked down at her and he said that's easy sister Billy Paul Adam why do you tell that I tell that because in that hour and in that Ministry the supernatural was almost natural if God said that to brother brandom I'm going to do it he just believed now we know that he had a special gift calling in Ministry but if God were to speak to your heart tell you he was going to move some circumstances around in your life you ought to believe what he says because the the the word tells us that we're a supernatural people serving a supernatural God yes sir and we ought to become not let the supernatural become common but let it be a part of our lives and I'll say this what many people won't say if it were not for the supernatural that God has done in this message and what I mean by that is making Jesus Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it would just be another sermon but it was Revelation that came by Supernatural Holy Ghost inspiration and then he came and said amen and he ought to be saying Amen to your life and to my life anybody here today yes sir well I'm preaching and I'm not even preaching I want to sing a song for you [Music] for so many years so many l were offered up oh but all the blood that was spilled could

going to the old book it's all the same book Amen brother brandom said it's two wings of the same Eagle Old Testament New Testament you try to fly a bird with One Wing he don't get nearly as high it takes both Wings the old and the new it takes understanding God had to give it to this world first in uh in types and shadows and antitypes and then he had to come in reality and I'm glad he did I'm glad he came in reality I'm glad that he came and revealed to us what the old book meant what the old Covenant meant it took on flesh and the word became hello come on yes sir and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as of the only begotten of the father full of what Grace and Truth Jesus is not the the the representative of God you know there are people even around this message that are quite confused these days about the godhead and they're preaching Tunis well I want you to know brother Brandon wasn't tuness and he didn't believe in two persons in the godhead he didn't believe in three persons in the godhead he believed what the scripture said there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word the spirit and these three are they're one they're one and somebody said well how in the world can you can you be the Son of God and be God I tell you it's something that had never happened before and is not happened in the same manner since and that's why the prophet of the Old Testament said who do you think could even believe such a thing something that never been done before is about to be done in the fullness of time God is going to come down the Son of God will become the son of man so that we the Fallen sons of men can be the sons of God brother sister don't you ever lose your shout over your salvation your Redemption amen we've been saved by grace and I first came came around the message they told me I couldn't talk about the blood I said whoa I can't be a part of something that can't talk about the blood they said well brother brandham said the blood didn't save you Grace did well let me just go a little bit further on that and tie some things together for you it's by grace that we saved not of Works lest any man should boast but Grace wasn't the token the life of the blood was the token so Grace became the transportation Grace is what took the token of the blood and brought it to your door stop if it had to been for Grace you would have never knew you needed the blood that's right and if it hadn't been for Grace you would have never been made in contact with the blood so we're saved by grace purchased by The Blood Bought With a price Grace didn't buy you the Blood Bought you isn't it wonderful when we can balance All Things by the word brother brandham said to brother Perry green whatever you do Perry keep your balance in the in the scripture Leviticus chap 16 ver 14 and 15 and he shall take of the blood of the bulock and sprinkle it I want you to say sprinkle sprinkle it with his finger upon The Mercy Seat Eastward this is a whole complicated uh setup here you take the blood and put it on the finger from the bulock and you uh turn Eastward toward the mercy seed and you sprinkle the blood it's a in the Hebrew it's a slinging like this you how many of you have ever had anything on your finger it was sticking to you and you just slung it like that that's what the Hebrews saying it wasn't a Sprinkle like the Methodist it it it was it was it was doing something like that and and letting that blood slip off the finger onto the mercy seat from the Eastward uh then he goes on before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger how many times not three times not five times but seven times God's perfect number the number of completion the number that takes us from Genesis all the way through the Book of Revelation the the number that means so much to us is believer sprinkle the blood toward the mercy seed on the east side seven times all you have to do is think a little bit that's that's like going to Ephesus going right down through it isn't it that's what it is then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring his blood within the veil and do what that blood do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bulock what was that sprinkle upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat now that's an interesting little ceremony and it means something to us today we're not waiting on that to be fulfilled Church it has been fulfilled let me hear somebody say amen amen and then before you take your seat would you turn to Isaiah chapter 53 verse 8 this comes from the from the same chapter uh of of one that we quote so often he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities I think that's somewhere around verse 5 is it is it 535 but I want to read verse 8 to you this morning he was taken from prison he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation question mark for he was cut off say cut off cut off he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people God is speaking this is God speaking through the lips of Isaiah the prophet he said for the transgression of my people was he stricken can I read it one more time he was taken from prison and from judgment now I know you're standing and I know we're not supposed to talk when we're reading the I get all that that's the reason I cling to the ver to the quote that says that church is Sovereign local church I do a little bit different I'm sorry but I can't help it my my it opens up it just starts opening up before we ever bless it you you know why cuz it's already blessed I have stood in Jerusalem uh near the ruins of the of the high priest's house whose name was Caiaphas I have climbed the steps from the valley of gehenna hell up to that spot on on the Mount of Olives or Mount Zion we would say Mount Zion and I have climbed down the steps into the church of what is now called St Peter of gaku and that church is there to remind us of the of the rooster crowing but down in the bottom how many of you been there some of you been there with me down in the bottom of that church is a prison HED out of solid rock and almost all the archaeologist 90% or more of the archaeologists agree that that is the pit that is the prison pit that our Lord was kept in the night of his betrayal and when I read this verse I can see him in that prison pit he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken today we could say as a church of Believers we could say that my Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua the Messiah was cut off from the land of the living so that I so that all my transgressions could be forgiven and I could be made like unto God that's what the word says father we thank you that your presence is here because your word is here and where you and your word have preeminence you are there you show up again and again and again and today it falls my privilege and my responsibility again to address the elect lady would you come today and anoint my lips and my mind in such a way that I could get out of your way and let your word have the highest position and get all of the attention because you deser deserve the glory and the honor and the praise we will give you all of that because you are worthy worthy worthy in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask for this help and the saint said you may be seated I don't believe I gave uh charity this verse so she might not be able to pull it up but I would like for you to look if you have your Bible look just one time to Deuteronomy chap chapter 16:1 16 because it talks about the the Feast of the Lord the Feast of Jehovah a lot of times Gentiles refer to them as the Jewish feast there's there's not a scripture in the Bible that says that these things belong to the Jews it doesn't say Jewish feast it says the Feast of Jehovah or or yod the Feast of of of Yahweh the Feast of God they belong to him and the reason why they're holy to us the reason why they're sacred to us is because God said I'm placing them as a Perpetual reminder not of what happened then but what happened when they were fulfilled and when we look at Deuteronomy 16:16 we read about three of those particular Feast uh the highest of the three three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose well we know what that place was it was Jerusalem it was the Holy Temple and that's where he put his name amen guess where he puts his name today in his holy Temple remember brother brandham come along toward the end of his ministry and what did he preach what house what house will you build me I know what Solomon built I know what Herod built I know what what Moses built in mishon in the Tabernacle of the Wilderness I know but I'm looking for a a house that I can live in in my people collectively this is not a one man thing anymore this is God raising up many sons the Bible tells us that Jesus was the first fruits of them which slept and he is the first fruits of those who conquered death let me tell you something there's a bride that's about to conquer death cuz he did he did it on our behalf there's a bride that's about to join in with his Resurrection Life the word in the Greek is anastasis and it means a reproducible resurrection the resurrection of Jesus Christ is a reproducible resurrection it's one that takes place in you and I when he changes us from Darkness to light when he redeems us from sin and death into the Glorious light and Gospel of Truth full Redemption and and and so we've got a lot to thank God for and and we ought to know just what he's done for us and when we look at these scriptures sometime we see it a little bit clearer so God placed his name originally in Jerusalem on the on the Holy Temple and he said I want all the males who are above a certain age to make your way to the temple three times a year and worship me that wasn't the only time they worship but it's the only time that they were commanded to come and do it in Jerusalem and those three are the Feast of unleavened bread which makes up a part of Passover is that right number one number two the Feast of Weeks how many of you know what the Feast of Weeks is it's chavot it's what the church calls Pentecost 50 pent 50 if you want to say it like brother brandham said he said seven sabbaths later we say 50 days brother bandam said seven sabbaths later you take that Feast of unleavened bread and you go seven sabbaths later and guess what you have you have Pentecost you have the Feast of Weeks coming to a reality and brother brandham saw the significance of that and he brought it back to the number seven he said you've got to walk through those sevens to get to the next installment of what God is doing and then after the feast of weeks or Pentecost is what soot or Feast of Tabernacles well we're in that exciting time right now this week was yam tah the blowing of the chofar the last Trump the great Trump of God and we there's so much significance there and we will not take time to talk about it again this morning but this coming week we will remember yam kapor the day of atonement something that is as it is as essential to Christianity as anything we believe you see there was a law that was established that the high priest could only come into the holy of holies one day a year but I'll show you in a moment where brother brandham said when that veil of the temple was rent in Twain there's nothing to keep this little bride out now we can go in and we don't have to wait till Saturday but I'm glad I don't have to wait till Austin's 30th birthday to go in behind the veil I've been in this morning I was awake at 6:30 this morning behind the veil and you better get behind the veil when you come in here to Worship the Lord you if you put your heart in this thing and you put your faith in this thing you're going behind the veil woo I love it because the very thing that was once established to keep me out on now is now established to keep me in brother brandham said when you go in there and that Veil falls behind you it shuts the world out and it shuts you in to the fullness of the glory of the Lord Brother no wonder listen somebody's waiting on a Rapture I'm I'm getting raptured all the time there is a Rapture there's a fulfillment of rapture but it's happening now that word rapture is not twinkling of an eye come on now the prophet told us through the writings in Thessalonians and so forth uh that that there's a shout coming and that's the message that has come so the Rapture is already in progress so when we get caught up out of the flesh not into our emotion but into the spirit we're already coming up into something yes we are we're already having little raptures on on the way to oh I can look at some of you and tell that you're just not quite there so just remain Earthbound amen you you can you can certainly live like a crow if you want to I know many eagles living like crows but I have made up my mind all I have to do is hear that it's for me in my day you see the Lord should have never let me hear this message because when he did I'm glad he did so glad he did but when he did I just couldn't put it all behind me you that know my testimony you know I called Brother Cleveland and I said Brother Cleveland will you do me a favor I want you to take me to where brother Brandon preaches this sermon has changed my life I don't I don't have to shake his hand I'd love to shake his hand I don't have to shake his hand but I would love to just be in the room where he's preaching and brother Cleveland said well I'm sorry brother Shelly he said I I I just I just failed to tell you I don't know why I didn't tell you I didn't think it was important when I gave you the tapes to tell you but now I wished I'd have told you that brother brandom passed away in 1965 I said you've got to be kidding me that was three years before I was ever born so once I come to the message begin to hear the message uh uh many years after that 20 something years after that I want you to know that I didn't know that it had to all be behind me because I kept hearing brother brandom say what was ahead for the little bride I heard him say it before 63 I heard him say it all the way through 64 I heard him say it all the way through 65 right up to Yuma Arizona where he preach the Rapture and he kept talking about what was to come for this little bride well they ought not to let me heard those tapes because once I heard that God was still with his people and that he still had a Supernatural representation in the earth in his many membered bride I said that's mine I'm going to have that if you would do like you were singing while ago if you'd rise up in the spirit of faith and take a hold of these promises and say if they're going to manifest in anybody's life they're going to manifest in mine somebody said I don't want to be selfish there's a time to be a little bit selfish here and that's when you're putting yourself in the promise if you sit there with a shovel and you keep shoveling these promises over to somebody else you'll miss your part what you ought to do is get you a spoon not a shovel get you a spoon and eat them all that's mine that's mine healing is mine sanctification is mine Holy Ghost baptism is mine fullness of the word is mine manifestation of the spoken creative word that's going to be mine too said it he said it you see what a lot of folks have done is they've celebrated what God did but what I've done is I've looked at what God did and I've discovered that he's still doing and that he'll do again you see there's a part of that Revelation 10 story that doesn't get told a lot and that's the last verse that's often Mis misquoted or not quoted at all and we shall do what what does it say right down there I can't get the verse I I'm not sure exactly what verse it is let's get down to that verse and we might even read it I have 10 pages of notes for any of you that know me you know that's a very short sermon and so I'm going to have to work very hard to get those 10 uh notes in here 10 pages of notes in here uh where it talks about prophesy again show me that is it 1011 and he said unto me listen and listen now I know you know Revelation 10 1-8 I know you know that a mighty angel came down I know you know but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery watch the verse stay with the word it was mystery singular mystery not Mysteries it was mystery and it was prophets plural not Prophet singular we got to stay right with the word there and here's what's important and he said unto me John who was a type of the Bride In The Rapture he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings did you know that's part of the ministry that's going forth right now across the world in the many membered bride not that press press play and Obey crowd but those that understand that in order for the bride to have her full Perfection according to the word the only way she'll be placed in total unity and Oneness is by the ministry of a five-fold five-fold Ministry yes we need to press play and yes we need to obey but when we've come into this house we've also come to yield to the gifts that God has placed in the body of Christ it's the sound of many Waters not the sound of one water it's the sound of many Waters he said my my my my getting a little excited here calm down calm down calm down he said thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings who do you think is doing that that's the bride well somebody said I know where Christ is in Revelation 10:1 I mean in Revelation 10 I know where brother brandom is in Revelation 10 do you know where you are do you know where you are do you know where the last day bride is found thou must prophesy before many peoples Nations Tong T and Kings this is a message that has to go out not only in word form it has to go on in flesh form so sending the tapes is not enough you've got to be a person a Believer a brother or sister who believes this word so much that you experience the transformation that this word produces in the life of a real believer let me just say it like an old Southerner you just ain't the same anymore when this word impacts your life you just ain't the same anymore and if you find yourself slipping back to who you were you better hit the altar as fast as you can because I don't care what kind of problems we're going through this is not the hour to be lukewarm this is the hour to pull up our chair around the fire don't you warm your hands by a painted fire when there's lots of genuine fire for you to get a hold of are you here so these little three festivals there let's hurry these little three festivals there in Hebrew they're referred to by a couple different words but one of them is a moed and a moed is a feast or an appointment there's also a word in Hebrew that's used where these are referred to as dress rehearsals now how many of you know what a rehearsal is what do you do when you have a wedding rehearsal I hate them I don't ever get to just a attend a wedding I always have to have a part and weddings are rarely anointed everybody's nervous now we have some pretty anointed weddings around here but everybody's nervous and they you know they don't want to trip and fall and nobody wants to come out and their zipper you know how all it works and so everybody's all nervous and so sometimes it's just a dry dead ceremony you want to get through it as fast as you can so you can get it all over with and it doesn't mean very much to anybody present that's the truth you may not like that truth but that is the truth but that's not what it's supposed to be but the night before sometimes two nights before you have a rehearsal and you run through everything and everybody gets told where to stand and one of the reasons why I don't like it is because I never have liked a woman telling me where to stand just being honest and they put the little tape cuz they think you're stupid so they put the little tape down there and tell you to stand on that like you're a preschooler but if you didn't do that charity didn't do that if she didn't boss us all what would we look like but a rehearsal is where you run through it you rehearse the song you make sure the key is right sir hello and you can't let people just Jive down the aisle like they're going to a sock hop or something they've got to learn to walk with a little dignity down the out you know what I mean you know some people just wasn't made for dignity and they end up looking like camels coming down the aisle but it's all right but you go through it you run through it it's a run through and just about the time you think it's over charity comes down here with her uh uh what do you call it clipboard she comes running down here with a clipboard she said do it again well you know that's the very same Hebrew concept that God instituted concerning these Feast of Jehovah he said lest you forget what they mean I want you to do it every year the Bible tells us in the Book of Ezekiel that we will be remembering the Feast of the Tabernacles in the time of the Millennium it has nothing to do with just Jews it's a one new man reality amen he said it is a Perpetual Feast unto the Lord so what what happened in the Old Testament and still happens today among the Jews who are not Believers in Yeshua is they just keep rehearsing this thing and rehearsing this thing and never quite getting it right but one of these days it's going to be the real deal woo it's not going to be rehearsals anymore we're going to see that every everything that hasn't already been fulfilled how many of you know spring feasts are fulfilled brother brandom taught us that the crucifixion of Christ fulfill the Passover and so forth the pouring out of the Holy Ghost fulfill the chavot Pentecost all that's in place but not all the fall Feast have had their fullness amen and they're going to one of these days yes sir Hallelujah there's going to be a blast that's going to wake up the Dead the voice of the Archangel the voice of the Resurrection it's going to wake up the day and then it won't be a dress rehearsal anymore for this little bride it's no longer a dress rehearsal because we've seen the reality of what God's word promised us if you believe that say Amen so we often call them the moed or the moedim plural of the Lord the Feast of the Lord three of them were major ones as we mentioned a moment ago and three three times a year every male had to come to Jerusalem and worship it was commanded it wasn't suggested there's one thing you should know about God's Commandments they're not suggestions they're Commandments and so the three feasts we talked about them one Feast of unleavened bread which is a part of the Passover Feast of Weeks which we call Pentecost Feast of Tabernacles which is soote three times a year and just before we go into seot our Tabernacles time for a week to remember a day we're going to remember a day where Jesus says to us in the book of the Revelation that he is going to Tabernacle with us and he is going to wipe every tear do you know when Tabernacles is going to find its absolute complete fulfillment when you and I are with him in that place that he has prepared for us and the scripture said and God [Music] himself not a pope not a prophet God himself shall wipe all their tears away there shall be no more death no more sorrow how many of you know that it's going to be the Fulfillment it's the finishing of God tabernacling with men my he fulfilled a portion of that when the word became flesh but the future reality is when you and I live with him in a new city that doesn't look like a cube it looks like a mountain it looks like a pyramid it's a holy place and this little bride is not going to be living on the outside of the city hoping to get in from time to time the the scripture tells us that we're going to live with him sit with him in his throne even as he has sat down with his father in his father's Throne we've got a lot to look for forward to now in preparation for seot you have the blowing of the chofar that's sometimes called in these days rosashana which is the head of the year and it's a Jewish New Year of sort but really biblically the feast is called yam turoa tooa which is the sounding forth of the chofar blast and the reason why those are important I don't know if we put that if I gave that to you or not but in the Bible and I didn't list the scriptures but there are scriptures that talk about three special trumpets that will sound to Israel and if you want to hear some some brother brandom Revelation and his important and Powerful Revelation you can go to the messages that he preached on the Feast of trumpets and you'll find some amazing things that he said there I rarely ever hear anybody quoting from that that message and it's one of my favorites because I understand it because I have my foundation in the Old Testament I'm a Bible student are there any Bible students here you know he said we ought to read our Bible two or three times a day somebody said I wouldn't have time for anything else yes you would he didn't say you had to read it three hours a time every time you read three three times a day but he said you ought to read your Bible a Christian he said a real Christian ought to read their Bible two to three times a day and I promise you if you'd take a little time and turn off the idiot box yes sir yours may be sitting in a corner or you may be holding yours in your hand but if you turn that off every now and again and open up the book and become a student of this word you'd be surprised how strengthening it would be to your everyday life sir you don't even know sometime you're being strengthened until you face a trial and you realize you're facing it in a way you've never faced a trouble before that's because the word is strengthening you how many of you believe the word's keeping us alive the word is strengthening us to stand in Satan's Eden here in the last days anybody here so then there's yam kapor the the the what we call the day of atonement and that that uh that word kapor in in Hebrew means an atonement or a covering and we are so thankful to know that the blood of Jesus has not just become a covering for our sin yes sir but it has become as the scripture said a propitiation a propitiation for our sin we are not just saved the church can call on the name of the Lord and be saved that's not what the bride is the bride is not just saved we're not just covered by atonement we are redeemed and redeem means we are being restored back to God's original thoughts about us before the foundation of the world now that Redemption is a powerful promise and the only way to understand the depth of it is to look at these dress rehearsals so we won't spend all of our time there today because I know it's not everybody's cup of tea and when I come to your house I can I can have your your favorite blend but but today you you you get to taste a little of this did we there we go the three special trumpets to Israel remember you can read about them in the book read about them in the Bible and you can hear Brother brandom talking about some of them uh in that in that message that he did on the Feast of trumpets the first trumpet is at Pentecost so at shavel oat there is a trumpet that is sounded the Bible tells us that it must be sounded and that is to commemorate the giving of the law on Mount SII where God himself according to the Hebrew of that verse God himself blew a chaar now that's pretty powerful God in the Book of Genesis came down and became a seamstress he made clothes the Bible said he made clothes to cover he took skins and he made clothes to cover the nakedness of Adam and Eve isn't that good when God gave the law at SII and the Earth Shook and lightning flashed there was a chofar that sounded and this is what a chofar looks like if any of you have never seen one and sometimes in the King James version of the Bible it will say trumpet but it's a it's a trumpet that's made from the Horn of an animal which is also quite spiritual because if you remember that when Abraham was told to sacrifice his only son Isaac up on the mountain and he was was willing to give him as an offering unto God he had the knife Drew back like this ready to do it and the angel of the Lord the voice of God cried out and the angel of the Lord stopped his hand and said do him no harm you see Abraham wasn't going to have to offer a sacrifice of his son he was just going to have to be willing to do it and the New Testament tells us that it was accounted unto him as if he did it because he was willing to do it and the New Testament tells us how he was able to do it he was able to do it because he believed in the resurrection and he knew that even if his son died before him that day that God was able to raise him to life again now you talk about putting your faith putting your your life where your faith is or your money where your mouth is let me tell you Abraham had real Faith he wasn't a perfect man but he had real Faith who in the right mind would take the life of their son knowing that God was able to raise him again it took it took a special built man and when Abraham was standing there uh in that moment there was a word that was spoken to him and if you look at that in the Hebrew it talks about he raised up his eyes and looked a far off and when you look at that in the original language it helps us to understand he didn't just look over the next Hill he was given eagle eyes that day Abraham had eagle eyes he didn't just see what was over the next Earthly heel he saw what was over the next spiritual heel and he saw that on that very rock on now that's the reason why our baby girl's name is Mariah and no she wasn't named after some Mariah Carri or some oh worldly ungodly half-dressed uh I'll hush because you know how they do I don't believe that a Believer I don't believe that a Believer is going to idolize that kind of trashy living that's right let me tell you something Taylor Swift like all the rest of them will burn in hell if she doesn't repent of her sin and is baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and filled with the Holy Ghost she may be the top influencer in the world right now in fact so much so that Miss Cala is very happy to tell everybody that she is supporting her now God help those little robots that are going to March down and vote because some pop singer that's right that's not how we vote we vote according to the own our own conscious and the leadership of the Holy Spirit we're not going to lead because vote because some influencer did such a thing is that you got to get your eyes off of what's going on out there in the world we named our daughter Mariah spelled m a excuse me spelled like the Bible m o r i a h in Hebrew it's Moria and it means the hill of the Lord the very same rock that Abraham was about to sacrifice Isaac on is the very same piece of rock that our Lord was crucified on it's a part of the same Mountaintop and there's only one little Valley that separates it from the mountain that he going to come back the second time and put his foot on the Mount of Olives on so when Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw a far off he was seeing that that he didn't have to kill his son because God Almighty one day was going to send a lamb woo somebody ought to help me preach a little bit here that God Almighty was going to send a lamb that was going to die on the same hillah this book lays together line upon line and precept upon precept sir that's good sometimes they stream the service they say you're talking too much about the Old Testament well I wish you I wish I wish everybody pay a little attention to the foundation on which this church is built the Church of Jesus Christ is the Fulfillment of all the promises of the old Covenant yes sir and in in the never mind come on now so Pentecost the first Trump then uh during the the sounding of the trumpet the feast the what the Jews call a new year which happened a few days ago it's it's instituted not by Jews but by the Bible The Book of Leviticus you can read it for yourself that one is called the last Trump but if you're reading along you'll find that sometimes the the the Hebrew or even the Greek is the great Trump the great Trump and that great Trump is the one that's going to sound in the second coming when his feet come down on the Mount of Olives and when the Jews who have rejected him look up at him and say what are the scars in your hands Zachariah tells us and he says these are that which I received in the household of my friends and both the Old Testament and Paul in the New Testament Romans chapter 11 tells us that all [Music] Israel will be saved now remember there are those who say they're Jews that are not Jews and this isn't even a Jewish thing after all but he says all Israel will be saved God gave Revelation to brother brandham concerning the fifth seal he saw those that had been martyred under the under the massacres of Stalin and Hitler he saw them held in a place in a in another dimension underneath the altar is what John called it in the book of the Revelation and they are crying out day and night don't you know they were crying out on October the 7th yes don't you know they were crying out don't you know their number swelled on October the 7th when those people were massacred without an opportunity to to even perhaps call on the name of the Lord and the only ones that are there brother ROM told us through the scripture is those that are placed there because of the testimony that they held which means they're held there for a particular purpose just like Jesus descended Into the Heart of the Earth and he led captivity captives and gave gifts unto men and preached to the souls in Paradise that brother brandham said we're already in prison and he revealed who he was to them remember the testimony meeting and remember how brother brandham dramatizes that that Abraham saw him and recognized him Shadrach Meshach and Abednego saw him and recognized him David said I've been singing about him for a long long time why did he do that he did it because he had to reveal listen this is the reason why why because nobody has eternal life except by the blood of Jesus Christ it's got to be Grace it's got to be blood so you can actually Mark out those paragraphs in the in the exposition of the seven Church ages when you read that some are given eternal life by being good to the bride that is not biblical no sir it's not according to the scripture and you don't have to quote it just leave it where it is brother random tells us from the Bible that you have to go by the blood that's the blood it's the life of God that sets you free from the bondage of sin now maybe you're given some Grace some special Grace or favor because they talk about the neighbor brother R talked about the neighbor who was who was good who wasn't a Believer but who was good to him and and and and makes this statement something like uh you know they'll be there and I have no reason to doubt that because a prophet had the ability to see ahead and know whether or not that person would call on the name of the Lord but you can be rest assured you don't have you don't get eternal life without without the Bible prescription that's right it's ABCs ABCs all you got to believe you got to always Believe come on goes right through gotta gotta believe confess you got to do it all well the great Trump is blown on the day of atonement and is believed by many that it will have a future fulfillment on that day of judgment when the Lord comes down with his feet on the Mount of Olives now I want to show you what brother Bram said we got to we got to hurry wow we got to hurry paragraph 130 come on Church help me now then once a year the high priest this is what this is what the day of atonement is once a year the high priest oh my had to be dressed in a certain way he had to be anointed a certain way he had to be Anointed with the perfume of the Rose of Sharon they put it upon Aaron's beard that Holy anointing oil and it ran all the way down to the hymns of His Garment he had to have a certain made clothes how many of you know it was so meticulous and so specific and it had to be a certain color and and the hemn had to be just right and there had to be an overlay that was made just right and another thing brother bam said he had to walk a certain way and on his end of His Garment he had a bell and a pomegranate a bell and a pomegranate how many of you remember that all the around around the borders of that outer tunic was a bell and a pomegranate he goes on to say and he had to walk a certain way and when he did guess what happened those Bells begin to sing and brother brandom is kind of dramatizing this and said a certain way to make that play he said holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy holy unto the Lord so as that high priest is moving in and he's going to sprinkle that blood on The Mercy Seat even the even the hymns of His Garment are singing of the Holiness of the Lord you understand the little bells are ringing and they're not they're not advertising uh the soup supper at the church those little bells are not advertising the Halloween festivals and carnivals they have around you know there are celebrations to celebrate the gods of the Harvest and all of the things that pagan-make not even caring where it comes from or what it's all about or what it represents or anything like that even the churches are all absolutely gung-ho and crazy over that kind of a stuff they are but I want you to know when those bells were ringing on that priest's garment they weren't saying they weren't saying you know come to the festival come to the to the soup supper they weren't saying come to the watermelon cutting they weren't saying come to the birthday party they were saying holy holy holy holy hly holy holy holy holy holy holy un the Lord holy under the Lord holy under the Lord what's he doing he's approaching the Shak yes he's approaching the shakina glory of the Lord and look at what brother adom says about the glory the real Fellowship Hallelujah did you know that you can have real fellowship with the glory you can get in the presence of God and have real fellowship with the glory I dare you to do that and come out with a dry eye I dare you to do that and come out like a Baptist you can't grab a hold of Live Wire and behave like a dead dog you get under that glory and I want you to know it'll mess you up it'll snot your nose somebody said I'm a tough man you're know and I don't cry you're just getting the glory god will crack you too you old hard pot he'll crack you too I've seen some of the meanest ugliest toughest muscular motorcycle riding Jason I've seen some of them look like they hadn't had a tender moment in their life get under the presence of God and go down on their knees in the presence of the one who is Holy come on he'll make you somebody you've never been before he'll crush your pride he'll break your hard heart he'll make you just a sloppy mess brother bandom said every birth is a mess it doesn't matter whether it takes place in a in a pink little nice decorated Nursery in a hospital or whether it takes place in a pig pin the mess is the same human birth is a mess and so is the spiritual birth he said we need some more of those acts 238 tongue talking babbling screaming we need that power once more to resurrect this bride to Quicken us again we need need a quickening of the Holy Ghost that'll break us out of our church enity we have followed in the ways of the denominations and God's not going to have a bride God is not going to have a bride that behaves like that system he's going to have a bride that behave like they did when Pentecost was I didn't fall I'm okay you don't have to call the law Apple was more worried about me than you are s Joy said we can see you we know you ain't about to stroke we'll come up there if we have to we'll pray for you you'll be all right sweet is the song Sweet is the song I'm singing today I'm redeemed redeemed I'm redeemed trouble and sorrow you mean you don't have no trouble you mean you don't have no sorrow I didn't say that then why do you sing they vanished away because they have in the presence of the Lord you get under the Living Word and you don't have a care in the world your dog is dead and your wife has left you and I don't know what all else is going on but if you could press in to the presence of the [Applause] Lord every bit of that just melts away for that time and somebody said then you get out from under and it all comes rolling back in it might but you'll be able to face every bit of it sir why because once from my poor sinick soul Christ did every bird unroll now I walk redeemed and whole hand in hand with Jesus hand in hand we walk each day and it in hand along the way walking thus I canot Stray hand in hand with Jesus if you're not walking hand in hand with him you better better find out how and do it as quickly as you possibly can because he's what's taking us through now brother Brandon goes on let's go back to that quote I got to get a hold of myself because we've got uh time is ticking away and we have a few more pages to go probably about nine Hallelujah Shak of Glory real Fellowship brother B said now you see he he had to make a noise the only way the congregation could tell he was wasn't dead is because they could hear the noise would I ever love to just preach if you were standing on the outside of the average church across this world with your ear to the door would you even know that there was anybody in there with a heartbeat [Music] I think they're going to have to bring in the IV poles to resuscitate people that are dying on the bench and it doesn't have to be that way somebody said they're being reverent let's be real let's be real it's not often reverence it's more like rigamortus that's right you see the the example that we have is that even the high priest when he went into the most sacred presence the Shak the shakina cavod the heavy glory of the Lord that he began to tremble brother brandom is making it sound almost as though he did something to make that happen but I want you to know the the Hebrew of that verse is quite clear it was something that was happening on his his body as he encountered the holy presence of the Lord and I don't know if it was his nerves or if it was the glory shakes I'm not sure what it was but the bells began to ring out and it's the only way they knew that he hadn't died in the Holiness of [Music] God for Generations that high priest had to stay up all night the night before and couldn't even go to sleep because if he did he might have a defiling thought that would disqualify ify him from going into the presence of the Lord he had to wash somewhere up of 10 times before he could even go behind the veil he changed clothes all day long it's the only day of the year that the high priest was commissioned by God in service to take off the holy miter and the breastplate and the Royal robe that the high priest wore you don't remember how beautiful it is the the stones on the breastplate the uim and Thim in behind that breastplate the band that little crown that goes around the miter and guess what it said inscribed on that little Crown it said Holiness unto the Lord It's Holiness then and it's Holiness now you can't approach God in worldliness and carnality you've got to approach a holy God in a holy way fools will walk with hob nailed shoes Where Angels Fear to trod some people ought to be careful amen but here the people were able to know because they heard the noise of those bails dinging and each time brother BR said it was like they were saying holy holy holy holy holy watch the man that's anointed and Aaron went in because remember Aaron was the first high priest in paragraph 13 2 talks about the shika glory and the noise and then in paragraph 132 watch the man that's anointed and Aaron went in packing the blood before him going in holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy holy unto the Lord them Bells chiming out anointed going into the holiest of holies how the congregation used to admire that Man how he went in there one day and left his old staff this is talking about another time left his old staff that he had in his hand and when he went back in that staff that was dead been cut off nothing but an old stick it had come to life how many of you remember Aaron's Rod it had bloomed and had blossoms on it and not only that the scripture said and it bore almonds if it was just flowers that came on it we could say why that was just something pretty but God said it was not only pretty but it was fruitful because God put almonds on the Dead stick if God can put blossoms on a dead stick cut off from the life of the the almond tree if God can cause a dead stick to come to life and bear fruit in the last days don't you think he can have a bride filled with the holy ghost from the top of their head to the souls of their feet totally delivered sold out sold out not serving God halfway not trusting in some picture or some some icon but trusting in The Riches of his grace woo I feel like I ought to just run that was the basis of fellowship and then in the message called Revelation 4 chapter 2 paragraph 218 I'm going to calm down now he said now now notice as they entered in the congregation could come there the priest could stand there but just the high priest could go in there that yam kapor that's the day of atonement he could only go in there one day taking the blood with him what blood the blood we read about what's he going to do with the blood when he gets in there sprinkle it seven times and he had to be dressed a certain way a certain garment he had to have on the ephod the linen ephod he had to have a bell and a pomegranate one to one another and when he walked he had to walk a certain way he was walking a certain way all right this little bride's going to walk a get and step you've picked up your country music get in Step you've trimmed your dead ends get in Step you want a little Holiness Preaching this morning brother you're showing too much of your knee get in step sir brother bam described the bridey saw sir she had on long dresses sir I don't believe a dress has to drag the ground to be holy but I think if you're trying to play peekaboo with me you've got the wrong Spirit maybe it's not me my attention you're trying to catch who is it we need to ask that right now I folks brother don't get mad at me get glad I'm going to say something else now I believe I got time brother Bram said you know just a little something a little decoration your husband give you something or mean something like that to you that was that was the way he made for people Paul didn't make that way Paul said the woman shouldn't put that on the Bible said so I'm just talk about the Bible now but brother brandom understood the pull of the woman the woman needing to be beautiful and feeling beautiful so forth so he made a little way for her but what we have seen around this message and around Pentecost is the spirit doesn't change and it can't just be some little something like brother brandom described it gets bobbler and bobbler and bigger and brassier and come on now right until they wear what looks like a boat rope around their neck come on now he he said let me how tell you how he described he said looks like they've gone through the dime store with a magnet hanging all that old stuff just hello hello but there was a voice there was a prophetic voice that cried out get in Step little bride God's going to have a peculiar people he's going to have one that doesn't look just like the world dress just like the world walk just like the world talk just like the world everything that little bride does is going to cry holy when she's in the grocery store she ain't going to have to be handing out spoken word boook BS because her life is going to scream holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy holy unto the Lord if she happens to find herself in a place of entertainment or something like that maybe she's at a fair or a festival or something like that that may be very wholesome everywhere she goes she's going to be crying out because she has chosen to live a different life both men and women have chosen to live a sold out life not to follow the ways of the denominations but to stand on the word and to stay with it and everywhere she goes whether it's a a pumpkin patch or a corn maze or whatever it is a a a a craft fair or a or a honey Booth come on Sir like brother Billy selling his honey everywhere that little bride goes her life is going to scream holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy brother you know this world they don't go up to the Jezebel and ask her where she goes to church on cuz they don't care where she goes to church because they know it ain't doing her any good just a minute come on brother preach now pastor but but what do they do they follow you around Walmart don't they they follow you around Walmart and they say where do you go to church just wonder where you where where do you go to church why because they see something something about you that says I don't want to I don't have to do just like any old fish that's what makes this message so great it it gives us a reason it gives us a cause it gives us a determination to stand apart from the rest of this old world you let every other fish in your neighborhood go with the flow if that's what they have to do you try to get them you try to save them you try to tell them the truth but in the end don't you let them influence you you be the salmon you be the one that says I got a backbone and I don't have to go the way the rest of the world is going I'm going to cry out my life my dress my hair everything I do is going to cry out holy holy holy not not I'm holy holy holy it's not screaming how holy you are it's screaming how holy he is Holy holy holy he had to be dressed a certain way the bells and pomegranates ring together holy holy while he was approaching God having the blood of the Covenant in his hand going before him bearing the blood 220 anointed oh my with certain perfumes his clothes had to be made by Holy Ghost filled hand registered hands make his clothes the rose of Sharon the anointing oil poured it on his head it ran all down his beard and then down over his place with the Royal perfume it's a beautiful picture we're getting here huh a pomegranate and a belt taking the the blood of an innocent lamb and he Dar to approach that Veil outside he'd die right there where he was standing so he had to go walking a certain way holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy holy approaching God unto the holy unto the Lord holy holy holy he went there and G he offered the blood on the mercy seat once a year and while he was in there he was privileged to see the shik glory when the pillar of fire the amber light that came down that led the children out of Israel even smoked up the temple so no one could see it the glory of the Lord fell somebody ought to be crying out for that the glory of the Lord fell till it was all smoked up you know they tell me that in the in the denomination thing and the charismatic things and the things that the church does to keep people entertained that they flash colored lights around and have smoke machines they tell me that they have machines blowing off smoke in the church to set the atmosphere let me tell you something there was a time when you didn't need an artificial smoke you didn't need an artificial light flash because the real glory of the Lord was in the house and the oldtimers used to say it's milky in here I've seen it it's milky in here because the glory of the Lord The Cloud of God's glory has filled the Lord's house and he is here to meet needs whether you see him or not he's here today let me announce to you he's among us today to meet needs he's looking for a people that'll get serious before him right smoked up the temple so no one could see the glory of the Lord fell till it was all smoked up he came to himself he went in behind the veil and settled down on The Mercy Seat in the holiest of holies Most Holy Place woo I got to hurry I was waiting for you to say amen and he had to be dressed a certain way walk a certain way but when Jesus died listen let's get to the good stuff 222 pretty special number here but when Jesus died the temple veil rent how many of you know the scripture said it rent doesn't only tell us it tore it tells us how it tore from what from top to bottom God wanted you to know he was the one ripping it open it Wasn't Man changing his mind it was God saying I'm opening up the way not only a high priest like it was on the day of atonement but now whosoever Will can have that same anointing of the shakana glory and walk a holy life holy holy holy unto the Lord and approach in the very presence of God through the blood of Jesus Christ before him I want somebody to say am amen I want you to look with me just a moment to Leviticus 16 again God help us I know that I I feel you're you're I feel you I I think I've embarrassed some of of you this morning I'll tell you who I haven't embarrassed I haven't embarrassed myself so you need not worry about me verse 18 Leviticus 16 and he shall go unto the altar that is before the Lord and make an atonement for it and shall take of the blood of the bulock and of the blood of the goat and put it upon the horns of the altar round about and he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times and cleanse it and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel let's go on to verse 22 all the way through and when he had made an end of reconciling the holy place and the Tabernacle of the congregation and the altar he shall bring the live goat and Aaron shall lay both of his hands upon the head of the live goat I want you to see that in your mind the high priest Aaron puts his hands crossed like this over the head of the live goat and confesses over him all the iniquities I want you to see what Jesus bore for me and you he confesses over the head of that goat what's a goat it's a scapegoat right and he confesses the sins of all of Israel on the head of that goat it's a transference it's a it's symbolic of transferring the sins of the people of Israel onto the head of the goat all the iniquities and the transgressions and all their sins putting them upon the head of the goat and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man Into the Wilderness and that goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited out into the Wilderness he shall let it go let go the goat Into the Wilderness now if we were to take time to go on we can't I've taken on my time we would read about what happens to the second goat the second goat is taken and killed and his blood is sprinkled to cover the sins of Aaron his family and all of the sins of the people of Israel now brother brandham is preaching about the scapegoat several times in his ministry and when he does he said I think they made a little mistake there he said they say that one of those goats represents Christ and one of those goats represents the devil the reason why brother brandham heard that is because there was a name that was attached to to one of those goats when they drew the Lots remember Leviticus says they drw the Lots they don't just choose which goat is killed and which goat is turned loose it's done by a lottery they draw out the lots and one of them says unto Yahweh holy unto God and one of them says Azazel which is a word that is sometimes translated to the enemy or for the enemy or what we would say for the devil but brother bandam said the reason why I don't think it was representing the enemy and he was right it didn't represent the enemy it didn't represent the devil but that name is a name that was used to to to place on that goat to determine the one that would die and the one that would be sent back into the Wilderness but brother brandom is preaching away and he said that don't work he said I believe they both represent Christ he said they're both represent Christ he said one of them died and shed his blood just like Christ and one of them had to go out into the Wilderness even outside the camp who would also die at some point he said so so Christ died for our sins but before he could die for them he said he bore our sins just like they were placed on top of the goat let me let me read you this if this don't listen folks you don't have to be emotional like me but if this don't stir your soul your spoons fell out of your bowl I'm going to tell you that right now you need to find your spoon if this doesn't light your fire your Wood's wet let me let me tell you what a prophet said here calling Jesus on the scene paragraph uh 43 or 44 somewhere I I may have I may have actually misnumbered that because or either I skipped I think what I did is I give you 43 and 45 didn't give you 44 for the sake of time but when the blood cell was broke in Jesus Christ what was released God he was God do you believe it that blood wasn't read it Jewish that blood wasn't that was a creative blood cell God himself was represented in that blood remember I sung a moment ago for so many years so many lambs were offered up but all the blood that was spilled could never fill that one bitter cup that's right this room would not be able to contain the blood that was spilled year after year after year after year trying to make a recompense for sin but what could not be accomplished Hebrews tells us Paul tells us in the Hebrews and brother brandham tells us in the Hebrew series that what the law could not accomplish in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his only son in the likeness of sinful flesh he didn't have to keep going into the holy of holies and coming out and going in and coming out uh a Hebrews said he went in one time once and for allall because when that animal blood cell spilled open all that was represented there was animal life Beast life it's not the same it's not tripartate it doesn't represent Body Soul and Spirit it's animal life it's a different kind of life and when that animal's blood cell is broke open it's just animal life but when the blood cell of Jesus Christ the real lamb the one that Abraham lifted his eyes and saw a far off it wasn't just a ram that he saw we know that he saw a ram in the bush and he took that RAM and killed that RAM and offered that Blood on the altar on Mount Mora we know that and later they could use the very Horn of the well I guess it's under here now they could use the very Horn of that Ram to blow the chofar to call the people to worship but what he was really seeing was more than just a ram to become a sacrifice that day he was seeing a lamb that would become a sacrifice once and for all somebody say once and for all that blood wasn't Gentile wasn't wasn't Jew it was a created blood cell read the next two words God himself and now through that blood making a propitiation for our sins cleanses the believer just a few minutes cleanses the believer takes all of his sins away from him as if he what what as if he never sinned the the blood of a lamb couldn't do that the blood of a goat couldn't do that there was only one blood that could do that it was his blood his blood that blood life falls on you it is though you've never sinned God puts them in the sea of forgiveness and the same God that was Upon Jesus Christ continues in The Believer are you too tired to listen doing the same works that he did here how it's the same [Music] [Applause] Spirit he was God manifested in a flesh of his creative son see now God woo take this trinitarian God created the son a iians 21516 And1 17 says this having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of Twain Jew and Gentile one new man so making peace and that he may here's here's what this whole thing is about that he may reconcile both unto God in one body his by the cross having slain the enmity thereby does anybody find that to be a big word and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby verse 17 and came and preached peace he's fixed to talk about you to you which were a far off Gentiles and to them Jews that were nigh aren't you glad aren't you glad that Gentiles were not an afterthought aren't you glad that God made a way for you the moment he made a way for the Jew he made a way for you God doesn't see you different anymore he sees his people as one new man I need another moment in Hebrews 4:14 if you don't mind I'm going to I'm going to uh just to push the bucket a little further out there and get in bigger trouble I'm going to read this from the Amplified uh 14 and 15 of Hebrews 4 it says in as much then as we have a great high priest let me just say this to you you have a great high priest sister Ronda you have a great high priest sister Bethany you have you have you have a great high priest who has already you're not waiting on him to do the work he has already ascended and passed through the heavens Jesus the son of God let us do what we've got to hold fast our confession of faith in him remember why because brother brandom said he only confesses the intercession that he offers on our behalf is based on our confession he is a high priest of what comes out of our mouth oh that's rough that's rough I I'd like for you to record yourself sometime when you're yelling and screaming and slamming doors and throwing things when you're red in the face hello when you're red in the face almost cussing maybe you are maybe maybe doing some what they call Christian cussing some dangerous words that are right on the edge you're redac you're stomping your foot you're carrying on just like a a fallen son of Adam in that moment you need to remember to be very careful what comes out of your mouth because there are some things we would never want him to take before the father I'm just quoting listen I'm telling you what the prophet taught us there are some things you wouldn't want him screaming out in the heavens that you might say down here on the earth he's only obligated to carry what what we confess so we ought to be confessing more than what we're living in the moment somebody said I can only confess What I'm Living that's not the truth you don't confess what you're living you confess what the word says you may be living the reality of high blood pressure but the word says you may be living the reality of sugar diabetes but the word says you may be living a reality of arthritis but the word says your family may be falling apart but the word says so you don't confess what's really going on around you you confess what the word said and your high priest Hallelujah who has no hindrance in going right in he doesn't have to pause twice he he has no inferiority he has no insecurity he goes right before the right hand of power and authority on your behalf be careful what you say for we do not have a high priest who is unable to understand and sympathize and have a shared feeling with our weaknesses and infirmities and liability to the assaults of temptation but one who has been tempted I'd heard some of the greatest preachers of our day in Pentecost before I came to the message and I'd never heard one sermon on the on the latter part of this verse until I came in contact with the ministry of brother brandom never heard one person mentioned who was tempted in every respect as we are yet without sinning King James says but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without s sin never heard one preacher preach it never heard one Bible teacher teach it because in some way they felt like perhaps it would bring God down you know and make him too human if he hadn't wanted to do that he wouldn't have chose that path he wanted to come right down he wanted to come right down to where we were living and face everything hello hello hello hello hello hello hello he wanted to face everything that we're living the prophet takes that verse of scripture and expounds upon it and he says it means exactly what it says Jesus was tempted in every way that any man has ever been tempted yet without sin somebody said well that was easy to do for him because it was God you don't understand perhaps that he was 100% God and 100% man so there was a part of him that found that rather easy but there was a part of him that felt the struggle that you and I feel somebody said well you know it didn't mean he was tempted in every way doesn't mean doesn't really mean that well brother brandham goes a little further he said in any way that you can be tempted he said that's like alcohol or women now let's come right down to where we're living it says he was in all manner tempted like we are tempted yet without sin and he did that so that you and I could understand what it means to be divine partaker to be partakers of his Divine life I want you to look at this in closing page four we didn't get very far the word atonement is spelled a t o n m n t atonement it means a covering for sin but it means something else to this Le bride it means at one minant atonement at one minant because the Bible tells us here and we will look at it as musicians are slipping this way the Bible tells us I've got to find it because there's not time for it yet in my notes so give me just a moment the Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians 5: 21 in the complete Jewish Bible and I'm doing this because it makes it so very plain this was Dr David Stern who wrote this uh translation and it's a beautiful verse it's one of the one of the it's handled masterfully you will remember it in King James I'll read it to you in cjb it says God made this sinless man be a sin offering on our behalf so that in Union with him at one me at onement atonement in Oneness what did Brother brandham call it so many times in Union in Union with him we might who's here help me read it fully share in God's righteousness he became as we he became one with us that we might in turn become one with him he who knew no sin sin became sin so that we might partake of the righteousness of God how are you going to live a halfway life when you Survey the Wondrous beauty of what God has done on your behalf how could you give him any less than your whole heart how could you even desire to be a Sunday morning Christian and nothing else when you survey the beauty of what it means to be at one in Union under the atoning blood of Jesus Christ with him it's bigger than life and if I had time I would have given you some other verses that talk about being divinely reconciled unto God we were once a part of him in his thoughts and life separated us we were sent into this generation into this hour all of God's thoughts didn't show up in leoda some of them showed up in other Church ages right there was a bride in every age but in the mind of God you were slated to show up in the last Church age in leoda and God saw your end in the same moment that he saw your beginning and it's not that you didn't have a choice Jason hear this carefully it's not that you didn't have a choice we have free will you had a choice but because God could see your end and your beginning at the same time before you ever came to the earth I hope this doesn't mean some ugly but they used to say you know before you were ever a twinkle in your daddy's eye before you you were ever in your mother's womb God knew you he saw your beginning and your end and he saw your decision the Bible tells us that he saw your choice how do you know the Bible says that because it says by his forn knowledge it's not by what he didn't know about you that he chose you it's by what he knew about you that he chose you by his forn knowledge he chose you and he predestined he said you didn't choose me I chose you but he was able to choose you because he saw that's right by for knowledge the choice that you were going to make and he didn't only see you starting out to serve Christ sister G he saw you starting out he saw he saw your yes he saw that it was an eternal yes oh that's good he saw your Sunday October the 6 2024 yes sir and he saw your end and what you're doing here is walking out yes sir that divine plan your destiny is determined by a divine plan by the great Symphony Rider the greatest Symphony riter there has ever been only a living God could put this thing together and let me tell you something you're going to make it you're going to make it you're going to make it yes sir it's not those who start it's those who finish but you see God knows as much about your finish as he does your start and you but how do you know preacher because I'm claiming the promises of God he told me to claim my house I'm going to claim my natural house I'm going to claim my spiritual house you're going to make it if you'll walk hand in hand with Jesus you have been reconciled back to God Amen and uh in in in the final 12th closing in the message demonology religious realm 53 1 paragraph 199 he died a sinner he said Jesus went he died when he died he went and preached to the souls that were in prison he died a sinner it's not a misprint he didn't misspeak it's exactly what 2 Corinthians 5:21 tells us if I had time I would have gone back to 2 Corinthians 5:21 and showed you in the Greek that there are two words there that are translated made two two different words one he made him to be sin for us so that we might be made into the righteousness of God in English it's the same word made in Greek it's to absolutely different words and what it means is simply this he was made sin the goat just got a word spoken over his head but Jesus Christ was made sin and the word made there the first made the first word that's translated made is a word that means recreated it means totally transformed so the body that he had was totally marred Isaiah prophesied it it was totally marred by sin his Visage remember Isaiah his Vis was changed and he did not look like God he didn't look like Jesus anymore no man the Bible tells us no man would have recognized him anymore because the weight of the sin of the world was so heavy on him on his head that it even changed the look not just the beating not just the beating marred the Visage but the original language tells us the weight of the sin of the world look my my sin your sin was enough to Mar him that's right the rotten that you have done the rotten that I have done was enough to change his image until he was no longer beautiful to his own mother who looked up and hardly could recognize that that was her son his followers could hardly recognize that they had ever followed the man that was hanging there suspended Between Heaven and Earth because the beating had had caused much disfigurement and swelling but the weight of the sin Paul said he was made sin recreated into an image of sin though he knew no sin so that you could be married because the second word made is from a Greek word that means married so that you could be married to the righteousness of God anybody here good I might preach another hour this is why I don't mind not having church on Sunday night was I'm going I take my time every Sunday somebody said folks more folks would come if you didn't take so long let me tell you something God knows exactly what he's doing he does he knows exactly what he's doing sir a football game lost lasts longer than 2 hours and nobody complains right major cinematic releases start at three hours and people will pay money eat popcorn with with chemicals sprayed on it to taste like butter cow never saw that stuff and they'll sit there and won't they'll hold their water is that too plain to say in the pool pit they'll hold their water they won't even go out cuz they're afraid they'll miss the big hero showing up with the big S on his chest you know and then people come to church and they want a they want a a water down I don't have to preach this year no need but you you're not those people they want to water down a brid look you may have got through high school and college with Cliff Notes come on now but some of us really read the stuff sir I really read the books I read the book when they told me to read a book I really read the book I got a feeling I got a feeling a lot of you never read the book now I know Benjamin never read the book you may you may have got by High School you may some of you may have gotten through college reading the bridge version and the but you're not going to get out you're not going to get out of here with the condensed you're going to have to eat this stuff you're going to have to eat this word daily daily daily daily daily he died a sinner knowing no sin yet our sin was on him and God for his sins listen and God for his sins did what send him to Hell remember remember he stopped off in Paradise where the righteous Souls of the old Covenant were living and that's when they recognized who he was and repented called on his name how do you know they called on his name because they followed him out of the heart of the Earth the Bible tells us in the Book of Matthew that when that when that veil of the temple was written Twain it says many of the Saints which slept arose and walked again the streets of Jerusalem the Dead Walking Around Town who were the dead that were walking around town those who had died under an old Covenant but when Jesus paid them a visit in the heart of the earth they saw him they knew him then they rejected him perhaps at one time but they knew him then there he is that's the one I saw in the fiery furnace Daniel said that's the one that shut the lion's mouth and let me have a rest all night long come on folks Mary said that's the one I held in my my arms and Drew to my breast and now he's the savior of the world he created the womb that gave him birth and now he is there to save my [Music] soul how was he able to do that because God made him sin for you and then sent him to hell I'm okay I did not fall don't call 911 all is well and what did he do when he got there what did he do when he got there well we know he showed up to those in the in the in the in between what what the what we call Paradise but what what did he do when he went to H he walked right in now he walked right in he made it he knew the address the Bible said God's the one who created hell he created it for the devil and his angels was never created for man he knew just where to find it and he walked right in he didn't wait for an invitation he walked right in the doors opened let him in they recognized their creator he walked right in the Flames couldn't touch him the the horror couldn't touch him the sorrow couldn't touch him nothing could affect him he walks right over to the one that was created for this purpose yes Once the Fallen once Lucifer the created being who worshiped Before the Throne now the deceiver of all mankind and he walks over to him he doesn't have to say much he's just done the deed he just screamed on the cross it is finished if you think hell didn't hear it hell Shook at his voice it is finished he could have easily said man is now reconciled to God he could have easily said now you are at one me the Union has been made man reunited rejoined to his creator God but instead he just said it is finished I wasn't there but I like to think he did this kind of like a dad has to do when a teenager is abusing the rights to the family car and hand him over Jesus just walked right into the Imp and held out his hand and Satan had to take the keys to his own house death hell in the grave and put it in the hand of the lambah that was slain for the sins of the whole world what did Jesus do with it he put them on his hip how do you know Revelation 19 tells us that when he shows up at Second Coming time brother brandom said the bride leaves in Revelation 4 she doesn't come back until Revelation chapter 19 when he's riding on a white horse and the armies of Heaven follow him on white horses so you don't really believe that do you with all my heart I don't just believe it with part of my heart I believe it I believe my toenails I want you be honest I know feet are ugly but my toenails believe it everything I am believes that not only is he about to take this bride out of here we're going to enjoy a honeymoon with him and when it has come to an end we're coming back with him sir at the finality watch what I say cuz you can find it in this message it'll be the finality of the seventh seal that's what he said not Rapture but Second Coming read it again hear it again fullness of seven seal foot on the foot on the Mount of Olives there the earth quakes it opens up before him no more Jew and Gentile the Jew is called in the Gentile bride is on the scene one with him let's stand at on M so so don't wait until some day on the calendar don't wait until the somebody tells you today is the day of atonement because we don't have to do that anymore we don't have to we don't have to you you should be in Jerusalem on the day of atonement it's a it's a odd thing to see they don't kill Lambs anymore but they do the ultra Orthodox kill a chicken and they sling it around their heads on a string speaking a certain set of words to remind them that there is a covering that covers all I have sat in the city of Jerusalem with brother Perry green on the day of atonement I I found it I did a search for day of atonement on my computer and I found the report that he had written the reason why he remembered the day of atonement so well is because he was already ailing some slowing down and it took him a little longer to eat lunch that day and I said brother green if we don't go we're not going to get back to the apartment tonight because they are going to shut down the streets and he didn't understand the fullness of what that means in Jerusalem when it's when they say shut down the street that's what they mean and we when we started to our apartment the concrete barriers were already put up and in the way and they were not going to let us go they were not going to let us go through the neighborhood can we leave the van here yes you can but but you'll have to pick it up at City Hall because it'll be impounded and I started pleading I jumped out of the vehicle and I'm pleading with them please this this man who's with me is an elderly man he's not feeling well he's one of the most important men I've ever known in my life if you only knew if I only had time to tell you what this man has seen in his lifetime you would gladly wave us through you'd move that barrier and let us through and they did Hallelujah so he wrote of that and we're sitting over there in an apartment and we know what's going on in the ultra Orthodox neighborhoods they're still going through some ritual and and because there's no Temple they can't kill a lamb so they've got this chicken and they've cut his throat and they're they're going through some and here we sit in the apartment and we're singing Sweet is the song I'm singing today I'm redeemed I'm redeemed trouble and sorrow have vanished away

week you shouldn't have done that you shouldn't have done that I I I snatched my children without telling them why I was bringing you shouldn't have done that I lingered too long on the on the country station when I was or rock or whatever it was when I was changing you shouldn't have done that you ought to know better than that you're not that old man anymore i i i lingered too long so something popped up on my computer and I I I lingered too long and I somehow I followed some I you ought not to have done that you're playing with your life you're playing with your marriage you're playing with your relationships when you do things like that but here is the reality of all of that you're no less a child of the king because when he paid for your sins he paid for all of them now that doesn't mean you just want to keep dibbling dabbling because this is a bride's not going to live a mixed up life she's going to come to full deliverance and she's going to manifest the life of Jesus Christ on planet Earth but don't you let your rotten things keep you from entering into the presence of the Lord It's the only thing that'll soften your old hard heart it's the only thing that'll give you a desire to live a cleaner life it's the only thing that'll make you want to turn your face and heart from the world and turn it to Jesus don't you come here under any condemnation there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus to them which are the called according to his purpose repent somebody said I already did listen uh the believer in this hour we have to say every day God forgive me I'm I'm sure I had a thought I'm sure I glanced I'm sure something it's not it's not the thing that goes in it's the thing that comes out that brings such defilement in this hour be careful what you let in because it'll come out and it'll haunt you don't let the enemy lie to you and keep you from entering in to praise him to read the word to hear the word you are not a hypocrite when you walk in humility before the Lord repenting as you go right we have so much to thank him for today and I want us to sing one more we don't usually do like this after such long preaching but I want us to sing one more because I feel like this is for somebody and if I knew who it was I would call you by name and point my long finger at you and tell you it was for you but I don't know who it's for but you will know you will know if the Lord is having us to sing this for you I want you to sing Benjamin I'm free from the fear of Tomorrow we don't know what tomorrow holds but we know who holds tomorrow and the next day and the next day and the next day how many of you are here and you'd say preacher I am facing some uncertain things in my life ahead I don't know what what it's going to look like I I don't know what some things are going to look like I don't know how it's all going to wash out but I'm throwing myself today on the mercy of a living God and I'm going to trust him when it's easy and I'm going to trust him when it's not easy I know he never fails I can tell you this he never fails for 49 years of ministry and Holy Ghost baptism he has never failed me one time and I don't believe he ever will sing this Benjamin we're going to worship with you maybe you want to come and worship with us closer you're welcome if you do so long I had search for lives me if you need to renew yourself to the Lord do it to enslave by the world you need to come home to him I G do it today then the door of the prison was open by love oh The [Music] Ransom was paid in US I was free oh yes oh I'm free from the fear of tomorrow my god oh I'm free from the guilt of [Applause] P for I tra my shackles for a glorious song oh I'm free praise the Lord free at last listen to this verse now I'm free from the guilt that I've cared oh oh from that door and empty life I set free oh for when I met Jesus he made me complete for you see he forgot that foolish man that I used to Hallelujah somebody say it hallelujah oh I'm free from the fear up tomorrow oh and I'm free from the GU Hallelujah for I've traed my shackles for for a glorious song and I'm free oh praise the Lord free at last soft on the music sing the chorus again I'm free from the fear of tomorrow and I'm free from the guilt of my past for I've tra in my shackles for a glorious song and I'm free praise the Lord free at life I want you to mind the holy spirit before we leave here today if God puts somebody on your heart not to embarrass them but if God puts somebody in your heart and you just want to go stand behind them lay your hand gently on their shoulder uh the the upper back and and just stand in agreement with them I feel like there are some who need some strength through prayer and I want to Lead You In A Prayer but I want you to see if the Lord would lay somebody on your heart this is a it's a body Ministry and we are the body we're the body and the truth is we're all needy but we've got such a great big capable God he's got it all and what a great opportunity for you to just Minister a little strength to somebody who's facing a hiccup in life there's a little catch in the road and things are going to get a little little hairy you're going to need the Lord but let me tell you something he's got your back he'll be your rearward he'll go before you he'll see you through it you trust him obey the spirit of God right now we're going to pray and go I could stay in this atmosphere the rest of my life I was born for this at atmosphere I was I was born you were too we were born for this presence when I go back there in the office I may feel a hunger pain but when I'm when I'm in that pre I don't even think about I don't think about the bathroom that's why I know some of you aren't in the glory cuz you think of it about 13 times in one service you don't even think about it sometime you get in that presence you just forget everything everything else and you just long to stay there right now God is going to impart strength into somebody because of your obedience lay your hand on them now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we are standing here as the representatives of God in the earth ministering one to another lead this body of intercessors right now brothers and sisters to find somebody that needs a little strength you don't have to know what the need is all you're doing is bringing your faith into agreement with their faith that whatever the need is the need meter is going to show up right now the need meter is going to show up and he's going to shower them with his strength and power in the name of Jesus you see these brothers and sisters and where they are in life I see see that marriages are strained and mother's nerves are frazzled and uncertainties are looming but I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that the holy spirit of God will breathe on you right now my brother that he will breathe on you right now my my sister and pour into you the strength of the Lord to run this race May he refill you with the Holy Ghost and set a fire in your life like you have once known [Music] let him separate you from the condemnation you faced yesterday and let his mercies be new for you today oh my God woo I thank him I know it's not a feeling we don't live by a feeling but I thank him when I can feel that presence woo thank you Lord thank you Lord someone is worried and and and burdened and they don't want to be they know better they know the word but but somehow the emotions are frazzled and and they become in a worried State Lord worry breeds doubt Faith drives out fear let your perfect love be poured over their life right now the perfect love of God that drives out fear perfect love casteth out [Music] fear Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus [Music] Jesus Nathan would you do me a favor I see you've obeyed the Lord Lord thank you for doing that but would you come here just a minute would you lay come over here and lay your hand on Jason's shoulder and his wife's shoulder there we're going to pray for them today you're a point of contact brother gy is already there praying for Axel but I want to tell you all something the only way that you all are going to make it is to both surrender to the Lord 100% And I know as a human there's a little fear there of what it's going to be and what it will require but I need to tell you that whatever God requires of either of you he will provide the only way that you all are going to be able to come to to a real peace and walk in real freedom is to both surrender to the Lord and all I'm going to do is ask these brothers now to pray that God will give you both Grace it's not our choice it's your choice I believe you've you've certainly tried to make the right decision in that but I'm asking the Lord and as a body we're fixing to pray a church body we're going to pray over this couple this family we're going to believe that God is going to get Glory I have believed for a long time over 20 years I have believed that God was going to get Glory out of Jason's testimony that he was going to bring him so through with such a victory that he would receive Glory from the word that come out of his mouth the grace of God that he testifies to Lord could this be the time as a body we agree right now and we didn't say that to embarrass them in any way but we said it because you pressed it on our hearts to do so and I'd rather I'd rather please you and embarrass somebody's emotion than to have to go home tormented because I didn't do what you told me to do so Lord I'm asking you right now to touch them both in the name of Jesus and give them every bit the grace they need to completely surrender to you they'll never be able to go forward one pulling one way and one pulling the next you can't plow like that Lord I'm asking you to give them the grace to fully surrender under and strengthen them as they go forward making momentary right decisions it has to be that way we just have to make the right DEC decision and keep making right decisions strengthen them to do that Lord grant the answer to Grandma's prayers and pastor's prayers that this life will be a testimony a trophy of Grace and that it will impact the rest of the children that are no longer children they now have children of Their [Music] Own reach for them now in the name of Jesus I pray Reach For Those grown men and their families and draw them to you Lord Jesus before they get so far away that they can't hear and feel your call Grant it I pray oh I'm free from the fear let set you free of [Music] Tomorrow free from the guilt of my past for I traed my shackles for a glorious song I'm free praise the Lord free last it's terribly late we're going to go may God just seal to

for him today whatever it is that you've got for him may he may he find it all may a treasure box of who you are just open up to him Lord like never before may he become just extremely hungry and greedy I never said that before like that for the things of God may he just become so passionate for more that he just sets everybody he comes in contact with on fire lord burning in my brother we would never want him to pass through this way and not be touched in some way burn in his heart I pray bless him and strengthen him I tell you a worship leader has a rough goal you are really in a position when you lead the worship in a church you've got a rough goal you're out there in the front may God encourage every one of you I know brother kade's dad leads songs there too Lord C encourage

sanctuary but do it greet one another right now in his presence be sure to tell sister shoshana's family charity and her husband and children how glad we are that they stayed for church today it encouraged my heart I know people want to be at their church on Sunday but it really encouraged me for them to be here [Music] today uh I have to say something I'm so sorry I forgot I love you children forgive me I forgot to tell you I have a little quick announ oh let me hug my buddy love you um [Music] [Music] I meant to check the story a little see if it was okay for me to tell this part I don't know if you all knew it or not but uh Ben and Kendra had a a pregnancy not too long back and uh they lost the we little one just just very early with some complications and it hurt I think only anyone who's walked through that can know it hurts it hurts you just it just hurts and I I didn't ask till just then if I could say that so if it wasn't okay with Kindra I sure am sorry that's just not something you just want to tell everybody sometime you just you just want to grieve it out and let God touch you but I am here today to tell you that God is a god of Redemption there are times when these things must happen and it hurts when they do but the only thing we knew to say to them was we believe that God will certainly give you a healthy baby and we believe he will and our hearts were very very excited when they came to the house last Sunday and the girls who had just got back from Colorado trip said Pap Pap look what we brought back from our trip and it was an ultrasound picture so would you rejoice with me and also pray with me against all complications there are some things that Kendra has faced in her body that we we don't even really know what it all is but we know that God can regulate it and fix it but with you rejoice with me that God is giving Kendra and Ben and Amelia and Nora uh a new addition to their home let's thank [Applause] [Music] God it was a hard time to lose one because because there were so many pregnancies in the church and that makes things just smart a little more and there's others who suffer in these moments but I tell you he knows how he knows how if I knew some little prayer to pray to make it a boy I would but since God is Sovereign I'll leave it up to you Lord but you sure do know [Music] that Ben would love to have a boy but it's up to you Jesus he's a pretty good girl Dad I'll tell you that so he he he might just oh please Lord you know would you go home before we preach again God bless you camp meeting October
