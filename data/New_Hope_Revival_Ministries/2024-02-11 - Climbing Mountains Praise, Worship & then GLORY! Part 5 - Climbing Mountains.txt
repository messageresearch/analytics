you believe that say amen I need a little more you may be seated at least up here God is good and he's good all the time isn't he amen we're just thankful to be in the house of the Lord thankful that this many of you have uh either come through whatever sicknesses were going around or you have somehow press through to be here today but God is worthy to be praised his presence is already here amen I want you to be sensitive to the holy spirit because he's trying to move against a distracting Spirit he's trying to push it back and if you'll just be sensitive to the Holy Spirit I'll tell you what it's about but right now we're just going to wait and see uh when that atmosphere would just begin to shift a little bit but God knows he knows and he's here if the enemy shows up at church you can rest assure God's beat him here I know he's here I brought him with me I know he came to church with me today how many of you know he rode with you amen you know you you've got to keep the conversation right you got to keep the atmosphere right when you're on your way it's important isn't it well God is good I I want to say a few things brother Henry is that you God bless you we missed you last weekend and someone was mentioning Henry and somebody told me got a haircut and nothing wrong with that and uh I kind of like short hair on men that's my tradition and uh I some I said I miss him I I said well first of all he hasn't spoken to me for permission I said he's announcing to the whole world that he's engaged and I don't remember I don't remember him coming to his other Papa and asking and I said the reason why I say that is because if you remember he was one of the first that came to visit us here and so we just feel like he's family I believe this is one of brother sto's daughter and her husband but I cannot remember your names but I remember those good-look boys and I saw their picture this week and I am so thankful that you all are here were you for a wedding or something we're very glad that you chose to come by our way and I'm glad that you are here I'm glad that the holy spirit is here and I'm glad that Kate is here I believe God has brought him and I'm so thankful for that he's been a blessing to us and uh I wanted to greet you this morning from Brother Josiah and sister Katie who were with us here for about a month and uh I was so blessed let's see I think it was Friday evening uh was still at the church a little late and uh he called and uh just had a wonderful talk with him and they're following our services and God is still using this place to be a blessing in their life and they are settled in Tucson now and they are at the Tabernacle with brother Daniel Evans and uh God is using them I watched the service last night for a little little while because uh they told me that brother brother Dwayne was here preaching on obedience and brother Daniel was out there preaching on obedience the same weekend so I thought well I'll listen to what brother Daniel had to say about it and it was compelling obedience is better than sacrifice some of what I'm feeling this morning is because somebody hadn't obeyed you know it's very very important to obey the Lord you know you may get by for a while not doing what God has told you to do but you won't get by forever I'm going to need some help on that you you won't get by forever when the spirit of God comes to you and tells you something you need to do in your life you better do it now we're going through a precious time in the spirit right now because there's a some of our folks are really seeking the Lord in a very uh special way and we're not talking about about it because the Bible tells us when we do things like that our arms before the Lord we don't let the right hand know what the left hand is doing but if you're going to enter into a time of consecration you need a prayer covering you need to let somebody know what's going on so that they can pray for you while you're in that season of consecration so we have a few folks who are really In the Heat of a time of consecration to the Lord and and uh you know still going on having to work and come to church and so forth but God sees what's happening there's victory at the end there's victory at the end and so we pray a covering over their lives and any of the rest of you who decide that you want to pull a side unto the Lord in whatever way you know I I believe that God sees our hearts and he knows what we are capable of doing and I I believe that anytime we make up our mind I want to give something up or put something aside to draw closer to the Lord he honors it whether it's a sabatical from social media that can certainly capture so much of our time or whether it's uh leaving off dessert you know for some people that's no sacrifice for those of us over 50 it's a sacrifice I used to laugh at the old timers when they would say I just crave sweets and I'd say well I crave biscuit and gravy but as you get older you you you just need it I just need a bite at least and so if you were to decide I'm going to I'm not going to have sweets I'm going to I'm going to lay that aside for a little season we're not Catholics and we don't observe lent but if you wanted to do that I believe God would honor that maybe you say well I I don't I I go I like to go to the gym or I like to I like to go to the thrift stores every week uh perhaps nothing wrong with either of those things but you might say Lord I'm going to lay that aside for a week or two I'm going to try to use that time more wisely I'm going to try to use that time to seek the Lord come on now maybe you would say I'm going to let my Monopoly go go and I'm going to let my video game go and I'm going to use that time to seek the Lord a little bit it's not the there's not just a need for one or two of us but there's a need for all of us brother brandom said you've gone as high with the Lord as you're ever going to go until you pay a greater price there's a greater price to be paid for a consecrated life and to hear God talk how many of you want to hear him talk to you you want to hear him speak to you your heart individually well he's a walking talking God he's still talking to his people if we have an ear to hear if you believe that say amen amen uh so today is Zion Mink's birthday and uh she is she not is she just one no she's two surely and she's looking this way Zion happy birthday two years old she has entered the terrific toos I don't let him say anything else don't speak that over your children amen terrific twos may God bless her Thursday of this week on the 15th is Sister Adena Hammer meister's birthday and she's streaming the service today for you that don't know who she is she is Sister alfreda's older sister she turned 91 today still working in the yard still serving the lord and for any of you who have met brother Bernie that's brother Bernie's mom and she's also a mother to the pastor of the church in Edmonton Alberta Canada where brother uh hild debrandt was Pastor for so many years and uh her son Ed is the pastor there so she's a she's a blessed woman today and we're thankful for her prayers for us you may not realize it but some of you have succeeded because she was praying for this church all these years so I want to say happy birthday to Sister Adena streaming this service today in Edmonton if brother Steve Curry would have remained with us I know that nothing could have kept him here his birthday is coming up on Friday and on Saturday would have been their wedding anniversary and Saturday is Levi's birthday he's un here uh not here today but he uh notified me yesterday that he wasn't going to be here that's a always a good idea I appreciated that very much and if I'm not mistaken Saturday although I think they're already celebrating but uh I understand that Saturday is also the hajes anniversary is that right now be quiet sister Anna don't talk brother lost it how many years is it six oh you passed the [Applause] test I didn't want her talking out of the side of her mouth to keep him from being embarrassed if he didn't know but I guess if you're still in single digits you should be able to keep up with that very well isn't God good um Austin is back home and he's got a visitor with oh no that's brother Todd God bless you both well the Lord is good I'm feeling a little more relaxed now you see uh I entered into this service last night and uh before I got here this morning and I met two spirits and uh I asked the Lord about them and he said one of them is the spirit of addiction and uh the other is the spirit of apathy and uh so I I have the definitions here and I believe there's somebody here who's dealing with some of these things well my God is greater and stronger and come on and these Giants have no right to talk to us addiction is the the fact or condition of being addicted to a particular particular substance thing or activity and so there are many things that we can that we can be addicted to it's not just alcohol or drugs some some marijuana or something it can be all of those things but it can be anything especially something that's not good or productive or or holy or help helpful or or something that gives toward our health instead of taking away from our health well I want you to know the Lord can deliver you lust becomes an addiction and it has various ways that it plays out in our life and uh there's a power that is greater than the you you you don't need uh you know you don't need sex anonymous or some kind of a program that they have you need to meet Jesus they've got programs for sexual addicts just like they do any other addict and you you don't need that if you will surrender to the Lord he will break that Spirit of addiction in your life and you'll be able to live a normal life not tormented by a spirit of lust or pornography there's victory for the believer I want to tell you something the Holy Ghost is not going to live in a dirty house let's see if I can get some help here I can't imagine the Holy Ghost watching filth I just know he wouldn't and so if we are that doesn't mean you haven't had an experience with God it doesn't mean that you haven't had a touch of the Holy Ghost in your life but he's not fully possessing you until you have the victory over those things I need some help today but where you haven't taken a text and the musicians are still there I'm still preaching and then that other Spirit of apathy or lethargy the word lethargy means a lack of energy and enthusiasm but it was apathy that that he spoke and uh apathy means a lack of Interest enthusiasm or concern I want to say that again I'm not preaching on this this yet I mean I that's not my text I got it here coming in a minute but apathy is the lack of Interest You Know The Enemy doesn't even want you interested in the things of God he wants the world to have such a pull on you or your buddies I want you to know it's all right to have friends that aren't Believers it's all right to have relationships with people that are not Believers but you better be careful how you make a buddy yes sir come on out of somebody that doesn't serve the god you serve Buddy's more than a friend I I I mean your Confidant the one you the one you want to be with the one you want to hang out with well you better know that that is somebody who loves Jesus Christ maybe they're Baptist but they love the Lord that's what they want to talk about at least from I I don't believe in being a Pharisee sayal I don't believe in being religious I believe that we can have conversations that are not uh uh Bible based we can talk about the weather if you want to fight you can talk about politics there are things you can talk about but my you find the truest Fellowship around the things of God so apathy is a lack of Interest enthusiasm or concern when you hear somebody say I don't care how many times you hear people say that I've heard people in this room say that I don't care so and so I don't care you don't have any concern that's what you're saying I don't have any concern well there are things that don't concern us and shouldn't concern us but our eternity should be first and foremost in our life we should be very concerned about eternity we should be very concerned about whether or not we are filled with the Holy Ghost and Fire we should be very concerned about our state of sanctification that is set apart from the world so I thought this morning I would just call a special service tonight about 7:00 how many of you'll join me here well good I'm only kidding you know this is what the world calls don't act like you don't know Super Bowl Sunday what I think that means is you get a bigger bowl of chili today than you would any other day or a bigger bowl of chicken noodle soup I don't care I don't care I happen to know who's playing because I've heard it over and over and over again it's Taylor Swift against the 49ers if if she walked in this room I wouldn't recognize her I know one thing if she's endorsing Mr Biden she doesn't have a full capacity if she thinks that that this man could serve this country well another four years she's got trouble that being blonde is not her problem it's much much bigger than that and it's all the world wants to talk about I think I told you some months ago that a con ERT she had in Washington state the crowd roared so loud it registered on the RoR scale it was reported all across the country and it could have been considered a mild earthquake can you imagine making such a noise over a a gal that you that you caus the RoR scale to register and then you come to church and sit on your [Music] hands or you catch this stream and you criticize us because we worship the Lord and there's a little emotion put into it you know I'm sick and tired of sports fans judging My Worship you've got something to get excited about over there well so do I I am most at home in the Pres of the Lord I've got something to get excited about the Blood Bought Church of Jesus Christ it's getting ready for a Rapture so in the name of Jesus Christ we expose the enemy now and we push back a spirit of apathy and a spirit of addiction and we call you out in the name of Jesus and we say to those affected by that Spirit you can be free you can be delivered you don't have to carry that you don't have to be under the influence or distraction of the enemy it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever when I first came around the message they were singing that song from the 50s a lot let's talk about Jesus the King of Kings is he the Lord of lords Supreme throughout eternity The Great I Am the way the truth the life the door let's talk about Jesus more and more let's talk about Jesus the King of Kings is he the Lord of lords Supreme through all eternity sing with me The Great I Am the way the truth the life the door let's talk about Jesus more and more is there another part to that let's talk about Jesus the King of Kings is he the Lord of lords Supreme throughout eternity the great The Great I Am the way the truth the life the door let's talk about let's stand up and sing that again let's talk about Jes oh yes the King of Kings is he woo the Lord of Lord Supreme through all eternity The Great I Am the way the truth the life the door let's talk about Jesus more and more that's not it amen that's good that's another great song I don't know how that got in there but that's another one but that one don't go with this far as I know we are blessed to have these musicians and uh I want to thank them for their [Applause] [Music] [Applause] labor I want you to turn with me again and I I just got a lot in my mind and on my heart and uh I hope you won't get mad for what I've just said said we we want to be free and if you thought there was condemnation in that you you missed you you missed it it it's it's not that at all but I don't understand why somebody would recognize their position and and know that it's not what they want and then and then choose to remain there the Bible said that uh excuse me the spirit of the Lord told us that this was a year for mountain climbing right and uh if you think that the Lord's going to come and pull you up the mountain you've got another thing coming he's not there to help us get all the way to the top until we have reached the end of our strength now you may think you've reached the end of your strength but you're not dead yet that's why we're still striving and struggling We're Not Dead Yet now he promised us when we've gone as far as we can go and we cannot go any farther first of all he promised us fire in the mountain that we could draw into our lungs into our spirit man the fire of God and be cleansed and purified and not only that but sustained and energized to continue to press on but there will again come a time when we can't go any higher and the word of the Lord came and said I'll bear you to the top on the wh on the wings of a white eagle that's right you won't have to climb the rest of the way by yourself I'll send a white eagle and he will come and take you all the way to the top and brother brandom tells us in the uh wings of a snow white dove I think it is he talks about that that white eagle that will sweep us in a a a fresh breath it's not a new message it's not a new messenger it's not a new revelation it's not an eighth messenger it's not a chief Apostle it's not a chief Prophet it's not an eighth guy but it's a fresh breath of God on the truth that we have heard that feels new it feels vibrant it feels alive it feels like a Revival for the bride and it takes us right all the way up to the top Glory we're gleaning in the word because the word is what's going to get us through it's not a feeling it's not an emotion it's not a gift it's the word that's going to take us all the way come on now amen and we need to pray I know you get tired of hearing such things but we need to pray more and we need to read our Bible more we need to know this word of God you don't know it by reading it you need to read it and then you need to begin to know it we know it by the spirit we know it by revelation we need to be so filled with the Holy Ghost that when we read a verse of scripture it so Thrills us that we could talk about it all night long one of the things that brother Josiah did he said I've been pondering on a verse of scripture brother Shel you care to talk about it with me sure he gave me one verse of scripture and we discussed it together and it just becomes life to you when the spirit of God comes and breathes on the word it's life to us so we are in a series about being surefooted because when I was told by the spirit this was a year of mountain climbing I was told be very surefooted and I asked I ask the Lord in this experience uh how will we know what can we do to prepare to help us to be sure footed and the Lord spoke five things into my spirit and the first one was that we should uh that we should keep our balance in the scripture and and I think that is so important today and the second thing is we should stay in the middle of the road not be carried away over here or carried away over there but but stay right in the middle ground because that's where that's the highest part of the road and then I heard that whatever we do we should praise until the spirit of worship comes and then worship until the glory comes and then stand in the glory and so I was going to this morning I I worked all evening last night uh finishing up the the fourth installment I knew that I had not finished the glory but I thought you know I'll I'll move on and I'll come back there's a danger in moving on and saying you're going to come back you don't always come back so as I woke up this morning I had that experience in the night where I got to church ahead of you and and saw that that Spirit of apathy and the spirit of addiction and was trying to deal with it in the realm of the spirit and then I woke up at 7:00 and the the Lord was dealing with my hard and I said no no I'm not moving on yet I'm not going to give in to the pressure I was feeling to move on I'm going to go back to where we were try my best to finish it up today and Tuesday and then be ready for next Sunday next Sunday morning and I am taking my time and I don't know why I am but I am you can tell I'm just not in any hurry to get to the meat of this but I will brother gy and sister gy are away this weekend visiting with family picking up some beef and I don't know if brother gley was ministering today I didn't hear if he was ministering while he was there sometimes he does uh but next Sunday he's going to stand up here and present to you our project that we have been preparing for down at the bottom of the hill uh he's got a little video that he wants to show you and and just going to tell you a little bit more about the details of what we're planning and I'm so excited I am so happy to think that we might have a place that we could sit down and fellowship together and not have to pitch the tent and not have to to be in the out in the elements and eventually not have to be in the heat I don't think the air conditioner will come first but it will eventually arrive praise the Lord but in the meantime it'll be nice to have a dry place and there's a lot going on there's going to be concrete poured in about a month and there's going to be quite a quite a few things take place and before it's over we're going to be able to utilize every inch of that Tabernacle that God gave us for his glory uh what is it uh is it 75 by 150 or is that right Nathan where is he say again not 75 by 50 the whole tabern so then it's 75 by 150 which is the exact uh Dimensions if you were to convert it to the Tabernacle in the wilderness so if you ever want to in your mind try to think about the size of the Tabernacle of the Wilderness you just look down there under that Tabernacle just before I came out here Tuesday night brother gy told me something that could be done that just shocked me I was so excited when I heard that it could be done you know we always hear the hardship or the difficulty of something I like it when somebody says that's what you want it can be done amen that's why that sits there three contractors marched off and said you'll never put that building there but one contractor Mr Webb Assembly of God man he said if brother Shelly sees it Pastor if you see it I can build it and if you saw it there that's where it'll sit that that right there shows you the kind of the theme of where we're moving toward so he will tell you some exciting things and uh yes I'm disturbed to how they're clearing the land we're going to be able to see right into somebody's backyard but I don't know but what God Will Make A Way and when they put the lot up for sale or the house up for sale you may buy it and if you don't I might one way or the other God knows what he's doing I had a dear friend encourage me this week that God knows what he is doing and that we need to trust him and i' I've got so many just little things I want to tell you but I got to get going now so I'll tell you sometime that's why we need a place to Fellowship so I can tell you some things what God is doing can I read you one thing while you're standing you know I spent 10 years in a in a community that I was not familiar with everything they did was the opposite of what I think God called me I didn't understand it I don't understand it now but for 10 years I traveled around the world preaching to Pentecostal and charismatic conferences to we we would have have as many as 3 to 5,000 people and my wife the only one in the building with a skirt on when I would give a prayer call an altar call I would have to close my eyes or look up in the air to pray for people because the women were showing so much decolette that's shoulder and skin you don't have to be showing your female parts to to to be exposed hello I see sometimes people come in here a little bit with a little bit too much decolette I thought this morning I'm going to have to buy me some scarves to hand out to people sometime who need to cover up some of the decolette I love that word you know where I learned it Israel you are standing on the on the uh outskirts of the village of capernium cerom and you're getting ready to go in and view the ruins of of capernium and there are so many Catholics and Orthodox denominations who like to go there because of it being the home of Peter Peter's mother-in-law was there and so many like to go and and they know they know that all these tourists charismatics and Catholics and different ones will go in there and it's hot weather and the first thing they want to do when it's hot weather is undress so that that group that oversees that they put a big sign out there and explains to people you're going to have to cover up your decolette because we consider this to be a holy place it's just a bunch of rocks and ruins I said as I was standing there so many years ago and saw that sign I said if they care about these holy rocks come on if they care about this hole in the ground how much more should we care when we go into the house of the Lord I won't charge you any extra for that sermon but I didn't understand at times and sometimes I look back now and I say Lord what was it four 10 years of going going going going and at times you were of course you had great preaching and good leadership but at times you suffered some because I was not here and um even my family many times my children but I got an email this morning and I I just asked the Lord yesterday Lord confirm to me again and show me why you had me in that camp I love those people I love some of those people I fell in love with some of them but I have got to stand on the word for the hour and all of a sudden I had this little short email this morning uh it's it's titled testimony thanks I just want to thank you Pastor Shelly in this ministry in around 2010 Pastor Shelly came to Sheffield United Kingdom with PKD and I went to that conference and I was in the middle of escaping an abusive situation in my family there was an alter call for anyone who had panic attacks or Suicidal Thoughts I went for prayer and Pastor Shelly you prayed both boldly over me live and defy the enemy those words spoke to me and I've thought about them many times and it really helped and she signs her name live and defy the enemy is what the Lord told her and and that was 2010 and this is 2024 and guess what she's doing she's living and defying the enemy so I said Lord you have a reason hallah amen well I was going to start at the beginning but I I won't do that let's go to uh let's go to Ezekiel chapter 10 verses 3 through five that may take you a minute to find me charity but we are talking about the glory we praise until the oh I feel something now come on we praise until the spirit of worship comes upon us when we begin to praise we're not waiting on a Feeling we praise sometimes it's dry waiting in to praise sometimes it sounds Hollow sometimes our own voices of Praise sound silly in our ears we think somebody's going to watch us hear us they're going to think we're crazy our voice sounds so defeated as we begin to lift it up but if we will praise him because he's worthy not because we feel like it there's only two times to praise the Lord when you feel like it and when you don't and if we will do that every time we come into here in addition to how we praise him every day of Our Lives he will send a spirit of worship and when the spirit of worship comes it's like pouring oil on what you're doing and you begin to enter in and it's no longer such a hard thing because once the glory Comes The Glory as I'm going to tell you today or either Tuesday night if we don't get to it when the glory comes it brings an ease and when that ease comes upon us there's no more striving there's no more fighting to get in his presence envelops us like a shroud around our shoulders and for that few moments we stand alone with God Alone in the Holy presence of the Lord It's greater than a shot of vitamin B12 it's greater than a Red Bull it's greater than anything you might do to give you a little pep I tell you getting in the presence of the Lord will energize you it will satisfy you but most importantly it will change you yes now the Cheri beam stood on the right side of the house when the man went in and the cloud filled the inner Court which is the holy place then the glory of the Lord went up from the Cherub as soon as I was saying that I was carried momentarily in my mind so that I could hear Brother brandom telling in the tent Vision how that glory of the Lord went and left the platform and hung over that little room he called it we now know that it wasn't a little room but it was a tent within a tent it was a small little structure there a stretch of canvas one time he called it a tent within a tent and the Lord said in that Vision just like he did in the scripture I will meet you in there that little tent doesn't represent a return Ministry of William brandham that little tent represents a bridal chamber a nupal chamber a HOA a hoopa if you will a place where bridegroom and Bride come together and they are no longer individuals on this day many years ago brother brandham preached the sermon Oneness and in that little holy place where the presence of God is to us it's like the holy of holies it's in there where we are most changed from glory to glory how many of you want to spend some time in there in the Holy presence in the cavod in the glory of the Lord in the bridal chamber that's he saying into thy chamber be free Holy Spirit Speak to Me Gently as I close the door Heavenly lover let thy presence cover shakina unending is all I long for somebody said if you're longing for the presence of God aren't you kind of leaving God out are you kidding come on God is where his presence is where his presence is God is if if you're hungering to be in the presence of the Lord You're hungering to stand before the Lord it's all the same then the glory of the Lord went up from the Cherub and stood over the threshold of the house and the house was filled with a cloud and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord's Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah and the sound of the cherubim's Wings Was Heard even to the outer Court as the voice of the almighty God when he speaketh this writer you may be seated may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word stay with me this writer is comparing the sound of the cherubim's Wings as they worship in the presence of the Lord as though it were the voice of God thundering out in the sanctuary of the Lord there's something about the Cherry beams that we as the bride of Christ have an identity with the Cheri beams were originally they were Guardians of the glory of the Lord they were angels of his presence they were those who stood most close to the Lord and to his holy throne in his holy house and the Bible tells us that when Adam and Eve failed the Lord that they were driven out of the garden that was in Eden they left the garden of delight and they went out into the land of Eden and into the land Beyond because we call it the Garden of Eden but Eden was a bigger place than the garden the Bible talks about Eden and then it talks about a garden that God built in inside of Eden and brother brandom so beautifully describes Adam and Eve they are they are downcast their heads are hanging and the Bloody skins that God Almighty has ripped off of the animals in the garden and dressed Adam and Eve because those fig leaves and by the way it wasn't a face mask when they took fig leaves off the tree it wasn't their mouths they covered it wasn't their mouths like eating of a piece of fruit or something that made them unclean or naked in the sight of the Lord they covered their most intimate parts and yet the rest of them remain naked before the Lord so the Bible tells us that God himself came down and made made them coats of skin and brother brandom describes it so beautifully there they go walking out arm in arm with one another and the Bloody skins still striking the backs of their legs as they walked out and God put those holy Cherry beams plac them at the going end of the garden and the Bible simply says we like to say they were there to keep Adam and Eve out that's what the Bible says the Bible says they were placed there to guard what the way they were placed there to guard the way to the tree of life it doesn't mean that no man will ever be allowed to get to the tree right how many of you are glad you found your way but it means that it won't be just a happen stance or some haphazard approach if you make it all the way to the tree of life and you receive the life of Jesus Christ into the innermost part of your being you're going to have to pass by the Cherub beams to get there so we know that the Cherub beams though they are Heavenly Creatures created to worship God and they are comparable even to the four living creatures that we really about in The Book of the Revelation they are directly somehow connected to the overcoming bride of Jesus Christ and so if cherubim's worship this bride is going to have to find her way into the spirit of worship they're going to have to praise until the spirit of worship comes the anointing to worship comes and then worship until the glory comes and when the glory comes you stand under and in the glory because you want it to have its maximum effect in your life is anybody with me I want you to be with me if you possibly can this glory is an important Concept in the message Revelation CH 4 number three uh paragraph 276 brother brandham said let's see Isaiah the sixth chapter this young Prophet had been leaning on the arms of the Good King I read this to you and he had brought him all kinds of nice clothes and he was a prophet and he got along all where but one day the king died so he had to shift for himself so he went down to the temple to pray that was a good idea because he began to get out from amongst where the king's place was now he's this this Good Old King King was a good holy man but he got out and he seen how the people were living so he got down to the temple now listen and brother brandham quotes the scripture in the year that King osiah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high high and lifted up and his train filled the temple not his Cho choo train but the train of his robe filled the temple brother random said Glory what's his train there it is Angels beings his train that followed him the trains what comes behind it was the glory of the Lord it was those angels that had been created to stand in the presence of the Lord and worship Him day and night they cry holy holy holy what did they say Church Holy Holy holy worthy worthy worthy you want to call that vain repetition I wouldn't do it if I were you I'd say that when you get in that presence of the Lord one Hallelujah is not enough when you get in that presence of the Lord one praise the Lord is not enough one glory to God is Not Enough you just stand there and you just want to say hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah 10,000 praises to God Hal halel Hal 10,000 praises to God now don't you be like the denominational people who stand on Sunday and sing Oh for a thousand tongues to sing my redeemer's praise and then not use the one tongue you have what would you do with a thousand tongues if you don't use the one you've got to praise the Lord I mean I'm not exaggerating when I tell you I wish sometime when I get in that presence that I had a thousand tongues every one of them saying hallelujah hallelujah the Lord Almighty reth the Lord God omnipotent is high and lifted up Hallelujah and is train his holy attendance those angels of his face those angels of his presence stand before him my God they don't just go before him they come behind him brother brandom said like the train of a wedding robe my glory glory somebody say Glory glor I showed you this the word Glory Appears 402 times in 371 verses in the Bible it's used to describe the Splendor and Majesty of God's presence it comes from the Hebrew word cavod or cabode which means weighty when you're moving in the outer recesses of an anointing the anointing you might be able to move about dance about run about uh jump about we've got this one woman who's commenting on all of our reals she has been burnt by holy dressing people she's been burnt by those who worship and jump and she just waits for another reel to come out Miss Rose she just waits for another reel to come out where's the preaching she said so we recommend someone sister Anna recommended how to get to the sermon and she just preaching is just not in her grid for now so to speak that's kind of what she said I'm I'm adding a little word there that she didn't use grid but basically listening to preaching is not what I do then why did you ask when you saw us worshiping the Lord why did you write on there where's the preaching now if there's anybody in this church that feels cheated in the preaching Department hello if you feel like you don't get enough preaching here I'd like for you to tell me where you can go and get anymore you might get better preaching somewhere else you may get more concentrated preaching somewhere else but I don't think you'll get more preaching we believe in preaching I'd rather preach than Eat Fried Chicken it's what I was born to do but but you know there always jumping she said is a is a new modern form of work worship oh my goodness get in the presence of God as you're waiting your way in through praise and you may jump a little bit of sacrificial jump you may dance a little sacrificial dance the old Pentecostals didn't think they could praise unless something took a hold of them and arrested them and force them to praise who wants to force their children to brag on Mom and Daddy what kind of a God would want to force you to Praise by arresting you of spirit and you didn't have any control you just had to praise him that's not how praise works it's sacrifice it's offering like I said a moment ago it's praising him when you don't feel like praising him then the glory comes the presence of God comes and You Begin so always somebody always somebody was listening to a marvelous sermon yesterday preached by another uh a wonderful uh real real Preacher Man and I was so blessed by many things that were said and I'll share more of it with you perhaps at another time because I as my family sat down to dinner last night we don't always have a Saturday dinner all together but we had a Saturday night dinner last night all together uh just like we had the night before Friday night all together but as we we sat down I said I heard a sermon today I want every one of you to hear and I said if I had my way I would desire that every message person in the world especially in the United States would be chained I didn't realize how this sounded until I played it back to in my mind Chained and staked to the pavement come on now and forced to listen to that sermon before you let him loose now I know that almost sounds abusive come on now but at the moment I was so inspired by what I heard and the balance that was being presented that I thought and I still think it today I may not I may not encourage someone to chain you down and stake you to the pavement but I might at some point share the sermon with you and you at your leisure if you can give it your entire time uh it wasn't that long of a sermon took me nearly 5 hours to get through it because I kept pausing it and I looked up every scripture and I looked up every quote and I thought this is a real balance on the gifts it's a real balance on a lot of different things but one of the things that was spoken was concerning songs and he said you know many people fail to realize that many of the songs that brother brandham sang were written in his generation therefore in his generation they would have been called modern worship songs brother he made a reference to the only believed book and he said this has been mandated yes I'm paraphrasing a little bit this has been mandated as though by Church Church order that every church should sing out of the only believe book and he said because surely these songs must be kosher if brother brandham sung them and so he said you've got people out there that won't even sing a song of worship if it doesn't appear in the only believed song book he said doesn't that sound like a denominational [Music] spirit he said there were songs in that book even there were songs that were sung in the meetings that were were written in that particular generation which would have made them modern which means that we are not bound to sing a song Only from the only beli song book or Believer song book we got two depending on whether you're you know using Canada's song book or or United States song book One come out of Canada one come out of the states both lovely books both lovely songs in them lots of the Beautiful song but he said some of these songs were new at the time so that doesn't mean that anointed songwriting ceased a generation ago I don't like the spirit that goes with some of the way these songs are presented today when I look at these uh music videos that the worshippers you know put out uh sometimes it looks more like a production than it does a worship service the way they dress you know in their in their worst jeans you know somebody pay all kind of money $70 for a pair of wor out jeans you know the truth is if some of you are early you'd be doing the same thing I see a tendency among some of us uh liking the trend and we'd be right in that Trend kind of a spirit thing you know sir like a woman in high heels it's not just the shoe we got to watch for because I've seen women around this message in flats that Twisted every part of who they are come on now when they walk down the aisle that's a spirit to draw attraction to themselves that's the way a lot of people that's a reason a lot of people do the things they do is because they want everybody to see them my that's good preaching come on Pastor tell it tell it tell it tell it I see these some of these worship people will send me songs to listen to and I always go and check out the video and I think oh my goodness this is utter confusion it's such a mixture of the world but there's nothing wrong with the song I said so let's bring that song into a different atmosphere oh don't you think that's borrowing from the world every one of us have done that every day of Our Lives come on you don't go to the you know we don't have our own tailor so we all go out there and buy our clothes we have to pick can choose through what we get but we go out there most of the time to get them so it's not like we can't take something and bring it in and sanctify it put our spin on it and our anointing on it and sing it to the glory of God some just I notice there are some that won't make the transition there's certain music out there you can't bring into this presence it just won't accomplish what it's meant to accomplish and when when that happens we know that there's a spirit on it that we don't want no part of but again I love the fact that this preacher was telling his people a a song doesn't have to be written in the 50s or 60s to be kosher enough to sing around the message of Truth amen do you know what kind of spirit that is a pheric spirit it's a spirit of the Pharisees don't get that on you if we happen to sing a song that's not your preference waddle your way through it muddle your way through it press your way through it your favorite song is in the mix it's not about you it's not about the worship leader it's about him anybody with me all right so that word glory for the glory listen for the glory to be manifest there must be a place for it to dwell we have to build a landing place for that shakina Glory Shak glory of the Lord in the message Israel and the church number two are you still with me there's a lot of meat to come so hang on in paragraph 137 brother vam said he seen God's glory what's he referring to Moses Moses Cried Out Lord show me thy Glory I want to remind you that he prayed that after he had seen God's Mighty Deliverance to the children of Israel he'd seen the Miracles that God performed to bring them out and sustain them in the wilderness but having seen what God can do was not enough seeing signs and wonders and miracles Moses had seen the pillar of fire Moses had seen the pillar of cloud Moses had seen food provided and water provided in super natural ways and yet after seeing all the Miracles he still said Lord show us show me yes I'm not satisfied with Just Praise and offerings of worship I want to see your glory and here's brother brandom's take on that he's seeing God's glory what is God's glory then miracles signs wonders and Divine Healing show me your glory Lord now we know that's just one element I'm not I I believe that I agree with that I say Amen to that but that's only one element of Glory here's the thing you've got to say and no you can't call it Glory if it's not producing the character and the nature of God his nature is to do Miracles his nature is to show signs his nature natur is to show wonders his nature is to show up and heal the sick come on so if you're going to have the glory you're going to have some of those things with it because where the glory comes God's Works come but it's not just about his works it's about beholding his face and being changed are you with me so we were together last we talked about it seemed like it's been a long time since I preached so I may need 4 hours today or just like I said one about 7:00 tonight you can you can bring your ures and eat them in the car when we're done uh I made it funny and I lost my train of the thought now's your chance to say bless him Lord help him Lord let me hear you help him Lord bless him Lord touch him Lord I want to get back on track here for just a moment Moses built the Tabernacle as we read few weeks ago I was talking about not preaching brother Dwayne has did such a wonderful job for us how many of you saw the podcast this week any of you see it in its entirety oh well we'll just prepare it for the rest of the world and you won't see it if somebody tells me you don't have time you didn't have time I don't believe you for one second let me go back to saying little less go go little less bubble bust little less netflex you could watch that podcast and it would be a blessing to you you testimonies are already coming in of what a blessing it was because brother Dwayne shared so many beautiful parts of his testimony and then he was here preaching last weekend so it feels like I have not preached in a long time what I was going to say to you was another great point that that that preacher made in his sermon he was talking about church order and he said you know brother brandom said the sermon should last somewhere between 30 and 4 45 minutes well I would like this is me now I'd like to call your attention to how many sermons brother Brandon preached that were 30 to 45 minutes not many somebody said well he was a prophet he had something to say if you're called of God to preach you better have something to say to and then he went on in another referen this preacher went in to make another quote and he told us where brother brandham talked about sometimes you need a 4-Hour Meal look how quiet it got he said sometime you just want to eat for four hours I wish you'd want to eat for 4 hours so we can get through two this morning say amen amen we talked about Jesus Christ being the manifestation of God's glory yes sir we talked about in 2 Corinthians chapter 31 17 and 18 and let's look at 18 in the Amplified 2 Corinthians 3:18 and the Amplified it said but we all with open face this is I thought this was the Amplified I don't know what that is that's the that's the classic I'm not reading I guess from the classic but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory that's King James isn't it from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord we mirror the glory of the Lord we reflect the glory of the Lord the word change there is metamorpho or the word that we would borrow from metamorpho which is metamorphosis which is going in like a worm and coming out like a butterfly how many of you would like to crawl your way into the glory of the Lord like an old inchworm and come out on the other side remember what he told us about that little room on the inside he said they'll go in one way and come out another way when God allowed me to re visit that place in the spirit he showed me that very thing happening people going in with their problems with their Hang-Ups not just physical deformity but also inward infirmity inner healing needed but when they came out the other side they had lost all of their intimidations they had lost all of their Hang-Ups and their warts and the problems that they had had their inferiority complexes listen if you can get in the glory of the Lord and stay there long enough you'll lose all of your complexes brother brandom confessed he said I have complexes you spend enough time in the glory of the Lord you'll lose your complexes if you believe that that's amen then don't rush us through praise and worship right then don't rush us out of here at the end of a service if you really believe that if you really believe that you'll want to linger just one more moment when he comes he's always here but I'm talking about when he comes with that heavy that heavy presence that arrests us it glues us almost to our seats right I've been in that presence where I could hardly lift my head up because I I I was so arrested by the weightiness of his glory presence and so it's in that that we receive that metamorpho that change we're changed into another image which is the image of Christ we're changed from our fallen nature image to a redeemed nature to a redeemed image image if you believe that say Amen the realm of Glory is the is is the realm of Eternity it is the revelation of the presence of God it is the manifestation of his presence he is Glory he is everywhere but glory is the manifestation of that reality God's everywhere but glory is not everywhere when we are in the glory we are in a manifestation of the fact that God's glory has come Among Us the Bible tells us that Jesus is the express image and he is the manifestation of the glory of God in the message God keeps his word I've got to stay focused now and hurry along I don't know who you are sister Betty but thank you for every one of your amens on on YouTube and and as I said that I got another one from brother Paul drown thank you for your virtual amens sometimes they're very very important especially when it gets so quiet in here say amen God keeps his word he said if it's for salvation if it's for Divine Healing if it's for blessing if it if it's for anything that God promised make Footprints every place the soul of your foot sets that have I given you for a possession let me go on down to where it's highlighted the fire is moving on let's move on from glory to glory can you read that out loud from experence experience Bible days are here again this little bride can live from one Bible experience to another Bible experience if God ever did it once he's able to do it again if you believe that say Amen if God sent a glory cloud that was so thick the priest could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud if God ever did that before he can do it here he can do it again if the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel out parted the Red Sea hell the waters back if God did it then he can manifest the pillar of fire visibly right here among us if we have the faith to believe if you believe that say Amen in the message unveiling of God it shall come to pass in the last days sayith God the light over the world is the light of the sun changes the seed from glory to glory we also become more like him as we live this is the inheritance of the Bride I can't see a promise for the church to live in his presence but I can see a promise that the bride as she's changed from glory to glory will be able to live live in his presence like him being conformed to his blessed image as we what as we walk with him watch what the sun does you plant a seed what happens the seed rots but inside the seed seed inside the shell of the seed is what that life comes forth and brings forth the stock now that don't look like the first the stock doesn't look like the seed that went into the ground there's a Luther it was a stock all right the stock went on and the first thing you know it brought forth the tassel see that was the wesland Revival wasn't like the other how many of you know the stock stage and the tassel stage is a different stage then Along Came the then the Westland Revival wasn't like the other then Along Came the Pentecostal Revival brought forth what the baptism of the Holy Ghost have we done away with justification have we done away with sanctification then why should we desire to put the Holy Ghost out it's all part of the promised restoration if you believe that squeeze an amen skipping down to paragraph 3:14 but God is still there to make that just the same notice what does it do it finally returns back to [Music] what do not misunderstand our cry back to Pentecost there's not even one part of me that wants to go back to denominational Pentecost there's not even one part of me that wants to go back to 1906 isua Pentecost I want to go back to the original [Applause] Pentecost the one where you don't have to jump up and down and try to speak in tongues that's their favorite quote jump up and down and try to speak in tongues that's referring to Pentecost under a denominational system the little bride don't have to jump up and down and try to do anything she's filled with the Life of Christ she's filled with the Holy Ghost so talking in tongues is no problem for her she doesn't have to strive she doesn't have to put on she doesn't have to work it up it's in her see the difference anybody see the difference you see here's what happened Pentecost made that terrible mistake they put a period where God was putting a comma just like the modern Pharisees of the message who have done the very same thing they put a period where there is a comma to be and he moves on and he moves on and he moves on the pillar of fire keeps moving it keeps moving it keeps moving it keeps revealing Jesus Christ I know we've had the revelation of Jesus Christ but he keeps revealing himself to us in personal ways he keeps revealing himself to you in personal ways everybody still here good let's see what time 110 imagine that we have plenty of time but in the end it goes all the way back to the original seed again you see here's what Pentecost did when they put the period there then they began to say well you you you got to we got to know whether or not you've got the Holy Ghost so AA Allen was running around with the tent and God was doing great things in AA Allen's life we should be careful how we criticize but like all other preachers he could get it wrong just like anybody else could get it wrong just like brother brandom could get it wrong and had to come back and correct his own self he may not need you to correct him because he came back many times right right streamer come on now and corrected himself right and so a Allen got this thought that because oil started flowing in their hands and I don't mind to tell you I've seen that manifestation there may be dozens or hundreds of people who faked it but I saw it in my life in my childhood I saw oil not sweat not water oil forming in hands I just said glory be to God God can do anything he wants to do we didn't make a Doctrine out of it but AA Allen made a Doctrine out of it and began to tell people if you if you want to know you've got the Holy Ghost here is the manifestation wow just like the seven Thunder people under Joseph Coleman were going around the world saying you won't know that you've got it until you fall out in the spirit come on I believe in in being slain in the spirit I believe in being overcome by the spirit of God but that's no that is no evidence but the Pentecostal denomination said if you don't speak in tongues you don't have the Holy Ghost which led people to believe if I speak in Tong Tong I have the Holy Ghost and that's the highest peak on now that's the highest place you can go you think I want to go back to that where we had to jump up and down and try because if we didn't speak in tongues we were told we don't have it you see what a pressure that puts on people if I would have been preaching that all these years some of you would have lived under that pressure next thing you know you'd have jumped up and down and tried to talk in tongues right all you get is a little you know a little twist on the tongue but when the genuine Holy Ghost comes you don't have to jump up and down and try to do anything right on the day of Pentecost the disciples didn't jump up and down and try to they just open their mouth hello hello in the message the Mighty God unveiled before us now the word is a seed and it cannot bring forth uh Ellas I need your help let's see if you can read this don't please don't make me retrain you to read do your best that's all we can expect don't read like a news reporter read like somebody who knows what they're reading about read this for me please thank you now the word is a seed M and it cannot bring forth until she the son strikes it the sun has got to be upon the seed to make it be to make it come forth and that's the only way you take the word and that's the only way you take the word read on you take the word see take the word of God in your heart and what and walk into the shakina glory you you don't go anywhere without the word you're not looking for some kind of out of the Bible thank you you're not looking for some kind of out of the Bible experience you're wanting to go from Bible experience to Bible experience so in your praise and worship you take the word with you you've got to stay in the word read on and when you do it'll bring showbread it will bring showbread which means the bread of his presence Mana he calls it there but it's not the Mana read on that's only give for a separated people the only thing that can eat it that's permitted to eat it is just the people who are permitted and knows it we know we know brother I know that I'm called to eat showbread I'm called to stand in the presence of God and live off that manifested word read on elas thank you Paul said here changing from glory to glory changing from glory to glory mhm you see finally it comes till it's back to its original Glory finally let me see that again finally it comes till it's back to it hello let me hear you say it together original read on it's just like a seed of a morning glory you remember what a morning glory is like the seed of a flower it falls into the ground the seed of corn falls into the ground what's the first thing it comes up and it's a little Sprout then it goes to a tassel then from a CLE back to the original grain right well that's exactly what the church has done mhm it come from Luther Wesley and now back to the original grain back to its original Glory come on back to the glory it was at the beginning the Sun that Rose in the East yes it's the same son s o n that's manifesting the same thing in the west come on what's it doing changing from glory to glory now listen read on it changed from the Pagan down into Luther and from Luther down into Wesley and from Wesley out into Pentecost now listen you you don't want to go back to the Pagan that'd be starting over right you don't want to go back to the Christmas tree that's like starting over you don't want to go back to St Valentine's Day that's like starting over you don't want to go back to Luther you take the truth that Luther brought just shall live by faith move on you don't want to go back to Wesley you take the truth that Wesley brought Sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and you move on you don't want to go back to Pentecost lost you want to take the truth of a real genuine Pentecostal experience and move on read please out into Pentecost on and on and on and on Hallelujah changing from glory to glory producing producing the hidden Mana the hidden Mana is not the Mana in the wilderness the hidden Mana is the food to the Overcomer in the book of the Revelation yes sir read on and now it's ripe to bring him back exactly like he was at the beginning right his same Ministry his same Ministry if you think brother brandham is only pointing to his own Ministry you've missed the message you've spent too much time on the internet with the critics he's not talking about his ministry alone he's talking about also the many membered body Ministry of the over coming bride of Jesus Christ read on the same Jesus the Same power the same Holy Ghost Hallelujah the same one that come down on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost that's manifested today now read that from Glory unto glory to glory amen read on and is back to its original seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the same signs same wonders same baptism same kind of people acting the same way what doing what acting the same way let's check the date 64 same power same wonders same signs same bapt ISM same kind of people act in the same way read on with the same power and listen to this the same Sensations that's good yeah I thought it wasn't about a sensation it's not it's not about a feeling but you let the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost come it'll bring same power same baptism same signs same wonders same people acting the same way and it will stimulate you like it did those men in the upper [Applause] room so it's not back to 1906 Pentecost it's all the way back to the original day of Pentecost read it it's from Glory unto glory and the next will be changed from this Glory into a body like his own Glory body we where we shall see him well go back and read that again without the laughter and the next will be and the next will be changed from this Glory into a body like his own glorious body where we shall see him this is not feeling to feeling this is not good service the next good service this is about being changed metamorph from glory to glory until one day we're changed into another body a glorious body like un his glorious body where we shall do what see him read on Abraham saw the same one more one more paragraph now notice we see how it was changed since Calvary we are invited to share his glory listen listen listen praise until the spirit of worship comes worship until the glory comes then stand in the glory since Calvary we are invited to share glory to share his glory that's right read on now in 1 Corinthians 12 we are baptized into his body by one one Spirit we are all baptized not by one water no one Spirit we're all baptized that's right now and then we become parts of him now he's talking about a baptism not water baptism he's talking about Spirit baptism now while you've got the mic read one more from the infamous leodan Church age in the exposition of the seven Church ages book number nine read this we haven't seen him but we have felt him we know him now as much as our limiting senses can let us but one day it will be face to face that is for this age read on he is coming at the end of this age now look at this partial realization will be made perfect realization completed realization now these may not sound like brother brandom's words but the concept is according to the message partial realization will be made perfect realization completed realization hallelujah hallelujah read on we have been looking through a glass Darkness isn't that what Paul was telling us but soon it will be face to face we have been going from glory to glory but soon it will be right in the glory and in his glory will shine we shall be like him in his glory will shine we shall be like him finish wondrously like him Jesus our savior the vine isn't that wonderful yes it is we are complete in him that is true he would not lie to us about that but one day we will be changed in the Adams we will put on immortality we will be all swallowed up in life then we will realize realization that will be real realization that will be real reality in that moment if you believe that say Amen 2 Corinthians 318 in the Amplified look at it I need just a few more minutes and all of us as with unveiled face because we contined to behold in the word of God as in a mirror the glory of the Lord are constantly being transfigured into his do you see the importance of the glory yes there's no hope of ever being just like him unless we stand in the glory and while we stand in the glory we hold to the word we're not hold holding to the sensation we're not clinging to the good feeling thank God for it we are standing in the glory clinging to the word of God we are constantly being transfigured into his very own image listen in ever increasing Splendor and from one degree of Glory to another let's stop just a moment let me look around let me see you let me see the hand of anyone who could say you know Pastor I believe at some point in my Christian experience I have experienced uh a degree of the glory of God and I want to testify to it hold up your hand if you're not sure that's okay but look at these hands what if I told you there's another degree see what are we doing this Year we're climbing mountains on now there's another degree of Glory Hallelujah how do we get to it not by another feeling feel it all you want to I believe in that but it's by by glory to glory it's by by by staring at him by focusing on him by looking at the word of God as in a mirror the glory of the Lord manifest are constantly being transfigured into his very own own image in ever increasing Splendor uh uh and from one degree of Glory to another for this comes from the Lord who is the spirit this spiritual growth this spiritual growth denotes change after change after change we sang here the other night from glory to glory he's changing me we could say from change to change to change we're we're preaching change you've been preaching change for 30 years that's right because we keep changing God is transfiguring us we are in the metamorpho we are in the metamorphosis we are becoming more like him as we stand in his presence looking at who he is in the fullness of his word can you follow that give us Psalm 84 and7 for those who are still awake this morning this afternoon read 847 Ellas King James and then Amplified they go from they go from strength to strength every one of them in Zion appears before God appear before God how do they go how do we go in Zion strength from strength to strength from change to change from glory to glory from one degree of Glory to another degree of Glory if you want a higher degree of Glory you got to pay a little bit of a higher price you can't pray the way you've been praying read the way you've been praying uh excuse me read the way you've been reading and experience greater glory you can't continue to hang on to a spirit of apathy on or a spirit of addiction and go from strength to strength from glory to glory you got to get rid of that thing you've got to shake that devil off in the fire Hello read it in the Amplified brother they go from strength to strength increasing in Victorious power each of them appears before God in Zion I can't hardly make it you never will if that is your testimony but that's how I feel let me tell you something you don't testify of how you feel you test ify of what his word has said I know I'm losing most of you quickly but I can't I've got more now than I'll finish Tuesday night so I got to go a little bit further in this they go from strength to strength increasing in Victorious power does that sound appealing to anybody if you come in here Sunday after Sunday the same condition the same way you've always come in doesn't it appeal to you to think you might have an opportunity it's not in my hands so so those of you who pray during the week I wish brother Shel would come and say something to me I wish brother shell would come and talk to me I wish brother Shelly would come and tell me what's wrong with me that's what I'm doing right now that's what I'm doing right now you quit waiting on me to do something for you and you do something for you and I'll be there to cheer you on from one degree of Glory glory to another from one realm of power to another Now read Romans 1:17 King James and Amplified quickly for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith how how is it revealed Faith to Faith so we're moving from strength to strength amen we're being changed from glory to glory and the righteousness of God is being revealed to us not all at one time but from Faith to Faith did you know that as your faith grows your revelation of his righteousness grows oh say that again somebody did you know did you know that as your faith grows your revelation of his righteousness also grows and as it is written what the just shall live by faith the just shall live by faith this coming from the from Martin Luther I mean Paul wrote this of course but but Martin Luther using this verse of scripture he's climbing up and down the the the the the steps of witberg Chapel trying to pay for his own sins he nipped a little too much beer his language was too coarse you ever read the writings of Martin Luther he wasn't the Saint the church has made him he was human he struggled every step of the way he spent a lot of time in the confession Booth he spent a lot of time literally climbing the steps on his knees reciting Rosary prayers to try to get some kind of peace right for the inner war that was within him some of you know that war right some of you have experienced that war one day he's got his Bible in his in his hand somebody said I think that might be a legend I don't care where he was when he got it he got it but I like to put him on his knees trying to pay for his own sin reading the Bible climbing up and down on his bloody knees when all of a sudden he runs that scripture from therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live not by Rosary not by indulgences not by by putting a coin in the Coffer to Spring somebody's soul from purgatory right on now not by going in the confession booth and drawing the curtain and confessing to a homosexual that spirit is predominant and prevalent in that in that hor system of Rome we're not talking about precious people caught in that system we're talking about spirits that predominantly Prevail so you're going to go in there and tell your sin to somebody who's in worse shape than you are and all of a sudden you get this Revelation woo I'm not living from confession to confession I'm not living from Penance to penance I'm living from Faith to Faith because the [Music] just I'm not living by the length of my hair or what I wear or whether I cover my head with long hair or with a cap I'm living from Faith to Faith and the just shall do what let me show you a quote from someone you're familiar with it's from from the from a book from a manuscript possessing Bridal inheritance it's back on the old notes you see I'm jumping around here you still here even though your eyes are Walling around in your head cuz you're so sleepy shall I read this to you should I have someone else to read it the adopted sons of the kingdom are about to be commissioned and sent forth with the full authority of their father whatever he shows them they will do and whatever he says they will say most importantly whatever they say he will perform what a promise what a promise shy goes on to say I mean you know you know brother green used to say you know you've arrived when when they start quoting you well I'm going to say you know you've arrived when you start quoting yourself it's really you know not not like me but I wanted to get it in there next next I believe that this maturing process is greatly accelerated how many of you want to mature in him what if I told you it takes place in a particular atmosphere you got to get in that atmosphere to grow up and him I believe that this maturing process is greatly accelerated as we spend time with our bridegroom alone in the Hoopa when we linger with him yes it's when we are changed read it glory to glory from glory to glory now musicans are coming I'm going to read two more verses we're on page 20 that gives us about 10 more pages for Tuesday night then by next Sunday we can get ready for number four I will give you a hint we're not Valentine's Day celebrators here it has Pagan roots and those who try to religious it those who try to make it spiritual have to do so by borrowing from the church system of Rome the very one that God is opposed to the very one that has done more damage to truth than any other system the Roman system the Roman Church system that paple system has done more to destroy truth than any other system ever created and organized by man so you want me to go and adopt and borrow Pagan cultures and ways so that I can tell my wife I love her why don't you do that every day why don't you take her candy every day once a week once a [Music] month why don't why don't you write her a note not a text why don't you do something to show her how wonderful beautiful how how thankful you are for her thank her why don't you try thanking her for what she is supposed to do she cooks a meal she's supposed to really that's a way to get Hamburger Helper every night of the week come on brother just tell what she's supposed to do why you chauvinist you ungrateful somebody you come on she ought to give you a tuna fish can tell you to get your own cracker if that's the way you treat her hello why don't you try thanking her for washing your dirty underwear nobody ought to have to handle that on she does not just because she's supposed to because she loves you because she wants to make your life easier wo that's good preaching why don't you try thanking her for changing the sheets on the bed where you're too lazy at the end of the day to shower and you crawl your dirty self in the bed come on now and she changes the sheets and you get in them and don't clean sheets feel good if you don't like clean sheets you're just strange there's not a better feeling than clean nice smelling sheets why don't you try thanking her she's supposed to come on why don't you try thanking her for that and then you won't have to run around like a pagan who would have ever thought message churches would have started sweetheart Banquets for Valentine's Day brother let her be your sweetheart all the time but because the subject just happens to line up next Sunday I'm not going into the detail but next Sunday the the the fourth part is about love it's about our responsibility in love I Heard a Voice who spoke to me about love you might make the guess of what it was all about but I was reminded that it's vitally important vitally important that we learn to love now everybody has their own concept I don't care what your concept is about love we're going to find out what's the Bible concept well if I don't if I don't get it this way if it's not said to me this way blah blah blah I don't feel loved listen we're not even talking about that we're talking about loving people the Bible Way and in doing so we have a great responsibility because perfect faith and perfect love run together and we've been told we're not going to get out of here into that place without mature that's what perfect means mature love if every other virtue in our life has to come to maturity so does Love and mature love it's about loving the unlovable anybody can love a sweet little granny but it's loving the unlovable loving the complicated you got anybody in your life sir my goodness I just thought about some of you you've got dozens complicated people in your life no wonder you come in here beat down some time you're worn out by all the complicated people in your life and and to be honest with you you're not so simple yourself yes sir yes sir get out of my head but we learn to love and When Love Comes to maturity yes then it's so much moreen and that's what we're going to be on next week let me read this in closing the musicians are already here Isaiah 4:5 you still got the mic why don't you read it in the King James for me because I want to tell you something else that Glory produces in her life and the Lord will create upon every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and The Shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defense this verse is not referring back to how God has operated in the past this is a prophetic utterance concerning a future installment of God's glory it's not just National Israel as we know her today but it's also the reality of spiritual Israel and spiritual Israel is both Jew and Gentile together as one new man serving the lord in the beauty of his word and the Bible said through the prophet Isaiah and the Lord will create upon every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion and upon her assemblies her Gatherings a cloud and smoke by day and The Shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory not only is the glory a changing agent in our life but the glory is a protection the glory is a shelter the glory is a defense in our lives when we experience the glory when we eventually mature and begin to walk in the glory it will protect us that's right it will shelter us it will defend us read it in the Amplified and the Lord will create over the whole sight over every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and The Shining of a flaming fire by night for over all the glory shall be a canopy a defense of divine love and protection a hoopa the Tabernacle the word Tabernacle the word canopy is often from the word Hoopa which is more than just a tent it's a nupal tent it's a tent of intimacy the more we spend time in the presence of God developing a personal and intimate relationship with him the more we enjoy his glory that protects us and shelters us I want to to catch that last line please a defense of what divine Divine love and protection thank you let's stand let me sing The Little Chorus that I wrote some years ago before Benjamin comes to lead us in a song of worship let me sing this song I Feel the glory I think we may have sung it the last Sunday I was ministering but let's sing that as we begin to prepare to Worship the Lord for a few more moments and

[Music] Praise Lord [Music] High Jesus Christ let me ask those of you that are standing here the closest to the altar would you step back and en join the others just would you all back up just a little bit please back up just a little bit more thank you so much what I want to do is I want us to take just a moment to to push that Spirit back out of your life if you're here and there is some witness to you that you have you you know I believe that you don't have to be possessed with with something for it to have control I believe there's an oppression that a spirit can operate against you with and I believe you can be anint OED by a spirit that's not of God so if you can identify with what I dealt with in the night last night if you could say brother Shelly I I realize that sometimes a spirit of apathy I lose concern I lose interest I lose enthusiasm sometimes it works against me and it causes me to be distracted and I'd like to have victory over that in my life or maybe you would say I realize that I have an addiction or that I have a tendency to addictive behaviors that are not good for me that are not building me up in the faith but have become a distraction to me and I'd like for the Lord to give me strength to be able to push the spirit of apathy or push the spirit of addiction back out of my life I don't want a part of that and if you're here and you have some witness to that I want you to step forward among those that are standing there I want you to step closer to the Altar and if you're not in the front I want you to come and join us in the front even if you're on the music I want you to come down but we want to deal with that thank you so much for being so honest and I think it's easier for you to do that when we when we talk about the various ways you know this is not your pastor saying you got a demon this is your pastor saying you you are impeded and hindered weighted down sometime by either apathy trying to take a hold of your life or addiction and not to be crazy here but you can actually become addicted to apathy to a lack of concern some people habitually walk without any concern for others in their life and for what's going on I find I find it every day as a leader that human nature is to be so caught up in what you're going through at the moment that you lose sight that anyone else is in a battle or that anyone else is in a struggle and one of the marks one of the Hallmarks of mature love of perfect love is to come to a place where it's nearly easier for you to see where others are and what they're struggling with and you put their need and you put more effort into praying and ministering to them than you do your own need now that has to come with limitation because we've got to take care of ourselves mentally emotionally and spiritually but if it's easier for you to relate to someone else's situation it's a sign that your love for them and as a Christian as a Believer is maturing and you're putting others ahead the by Jesus said by this shall all men know that you're my disciples not that you go to church with me but but that you're my disciples because of your love because you have love one for another and I don't even like talking about love sometime because people's idea and definition of love is so sappy until they don't even know what it really means to to love or to be loved but we're talking about putting yourself intercession in truest form is is putting yourself in someone else's environment in someone else's situation and standing there on their behalf before God Lord have mercy on my brother have mercy on my sister it's not you judging their life but it's you going Before the Throne on their behalf because sometimes they're too weak or they're too affected by apathy or too affected by addiction to go for themselves now in the night I visited this service and saw those two predominant Spirits trying to raise their head to distract the body now we worshiped through that even though you could feel that worship was a little bit in the body at least it was a little disjointed but we pushed in that's what we're trained to do that's what we're created to do is to push in even in that moment of being disjointed one from another and in the preaching we did pretty good in pulling so that we could push through some of that but now we have an opportunity to deal with that and we just say no we say no to addictive Tendencies come on you pray with me we say no to the spirit of addiction that wants to take hold of my life simply to distract me that Spirit can't change who you are in Christ but he wants to impede your journey and and what he wants to do is drown you in condemnation and so we say no to the spirit of addiction and to the spirit of addictive behavior in the name of Jesus Christ to those who have stepped forward to acknowledge the influence of that spirit in their life to those who are streaming this service to those who will watch it in archive in the authority of Jesus Christ we say no to that Spirit Take Your Filthy Hands Off the children of the most high God the overcoming powerful Victorious bride of Christ should not be should not be arrested or Paralyzed by addictive behaviors in the name of Jesus may God release grace to you right now to step out of that cycle that some of you have been in most of your life and when you break free from one addictive behavior you find yourself in another so what you're doing is replacing an addiction with an addiction in the name of Jesus Christ if you feel any of that for yourself raise up both of your hands it's more than don't dare miss this it's more than alcohol it's more than pot it's more than drugs it's more than sexual behaviors it's that are not holy and healthy for you it's more than it's anything it's eating it's eating it's doing it's it's red bulls it's anything that you do that you become so caught up in that it begins to affect your health physically or spiritually father in the name of Jesus Christ we receive right now it doesn't have to be by the casting out of a spirit because we're defeating that spirit with the with the name of Jesus by the authority of the word and by the power of the blood we say we call an in we declare and decree an end and we lay a spiritual ax at the root of that spirit and by faith we separate you as children of the most high God from The Addictive Behavior from the spirit of addiction that has held you ish May if your hands are up and you've identified yourself with some of that I want those around you even even with the same problem to put one hand over on your shoulder for just a moment because there's strength in this there's an element of embarrassment there's an element of embarrassment and there's an element of shame that goes with these things but we just say no to shame and we say no to condemnation and we say no to embarrassment right now we don't care we don't care if our flesh gets embarrassed we don't care today we choose not to be concerned about about our our reputation we choose not to be concerned a and more so we are concerned about our freedom in Christ we don't want to move around one Sunday with Liberty only to find that the week ahead is full of addiction full of addictive behavior it's [Music] toxic it's toxic it poisons relationships in the name of Jesus Christ there's Authority in this house there's Authority in this house I'm not expecting you to feel it but there is Authority in this house right now over your head take your Victory take your Liberty but I've tried it and I've tried this and I've tried that try it this way try it this way today Lord Jesus help me Lord Jesus here I am I want to be out from under the influence of the things that Satan sends to my detriment and to my destruction out of it spirit of God Holy Ghost intercede for us holy ghost intercede for us until we break free Holy Ghost come and do in us what we can't do for ourselves come and do through us and in us what we cannot do for ourselves did you know you can be addicted to feeling sorry for [Music] yourself let that be broken let that be broken let that be broken you can become addicted to looking at everybody else's life and comparing it to yours let that be broken the devil's so stupid sometime he's so foolish sometime he'll make you think that what you see on other people's Facebook is how they really live and make you jealous of something that doesn't even really exist it's a facade it's a ruse that the enemy tries to put out there and you struggle you struggle you struggle with that break break that now break that break that in the authority of Jesus Christ break that right now now break that now Lord we pray for those who step forward because they deal with a with a with a spirit of apathy with a with a lingering sense of not caring enough a lack of enthusiasm a lack of concern and so Lord right now as only you can we call you to light a fire in our lives we're tired of a lack of interest in the things of God we're tired of a lack of interest in the word of God we're tired of replacing the word with all kinds of other things we must learn to live in Balance there's time for other things besides the word but we want to live in balance in wholeness Inc completeness in our life and somebody may have to do without something so that you can have your time with the word in the name of Jesus now Lord those that are standing here with that thing that has prevailed in their life from time to time apathy we break that off the see the truth just telling the truth just speaking it out can do so much just by telling you what happened in the spirit already can really bring your faith level up if you'll let it devil already trying to talk to some of you but tell him you've been listening to him long enough you're tired of what he has to say he's a liar and the father of all lies today I choose to hear the word of God speaking in my life and over my life and to my [Music] life some of you keep making terrible mistakes with your decisions because you have not surrendered to obedience you have not surrendered to obey the Lord and so you keep making self-sabotaging decisions and self-destructive decisions because you haven't obeyed the Lord may God breathe over you strength right now to to to obey his voice to do what he has called you to do you may not be worthy of the calling who is but he loved you and he called you and he doesn't call us without giving us what we need and equipping us to do his will break off in the name of Jesus all apathy all apathy all addiction May the grace of God come to make better choices and better decisions in our life get ready Benjamin in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus now I want you to praise the Lord with me I want you to Worship the Lord with me for just a moment a a as we recognize that God loved us so much that he wanted to deal with that part if you're standing here in condemnation that's not of God tell the devil to go if the enemy's trying to embarrass you that's not of God tell the enemy no I'm not giving in to that if he's trying to shame you tell him right now I'm not going to walk out of here in shame I'm just struggling on the journey to the throne I'm making my way to the throne I'm making my way to the holy of holies and these are these are are like parasites that get a hold of our life to suck out the life but I'm just a pilgrim on a journey to the throne and God will save me from Despair and God will save me from addiction and he will save me from apathy and whatever else the enemy would would throw my way yes Lord next week we'll talk to you about the stronghold of cold love as we present the message that the Lord has given us so if the enemy comes to try to turn your love cold Your Love toward him your love toward others you can break free from that right in the Song of Solomon it says it talks about setting a seal on the arm and this is this is a a metaphor [Music] of a Perpetual love for the bridegroom as we are reminded that he perpetually loves us and he loves us just as we are but he loves us too much to leave us that way he wants to constantly make changes and differences aren't we blessed aren't we blessed to serve a god like that aren't we blessed to have a lover like that
