[40:22] we're so glad to see you in the house of
[40:24] the Lord with us
[40:26] on this Sunday morning that many are
[40:30] calling Easter Sunday
[40:32] I don't celebrate Easter
[40:36] I celebrate the resurrection and I don't
[40:38] just do it one day a year
[40:40] I celebrated Resurrection in my life and
[40:43] I'm grateful for it every single day
[40:45] because if he had not come up out of the
[40:48] Grave I would be lost in my sins and
[40:51] trespasses I would be wandering around
[40:54] like a lot of this world not knowing
[40:56] what uh what to do or how to go and and
[40:59] what their life is going to end up but
[41:01] when I look around at all of the world's
[41:04] seen and I see darkness and Blackness I
[41:07] then look up and I thank God for the
[41:09] light that he has shed across my pathway
[41:12] that I can know that he is alive and
[41:15] well and he's leading this little bride
[41:17] straight into Victory Hallelujah
[41:21] before we receive the offering today it
[41:23] was a request of brother Daniel Miller
[41:25] that I let the church know that is with
[41:28] joyous heart that they're announcing
[41:31] that their son-in-law Austin with their
[41:34] daughter sister Anna Christine and the
[41:36] granddaughter Gwendolyn they have made
[41:38] the decision to make New Hope their home
[41:41] church and they'll be traveling to
[41:44] Alabama this week they are asking for
[41:47] our prayers as they get all the house
[41:48] listings and all the necessary things
[41:51] done there where they're at and then
[41:54] making their way this way God is helping
[41:57] them and giving them Grace and help
[41:59] along the way testimonies day by day of
[42:02] the grace of God and so we want to
[42:04] remember them this week as they're
[42:06] making their way they're planning to be
[42:08] here in the service next weekend by the
[42:10] grace of God and then they got all the
[42:13] settling in in Alabama so we want to ask
[42:16] the Lord just to help them with every
[42:18] facet of that the Lord is doing great
[42:21] things and I want to be right in the
[42:24] middle of it agreeing with the mind of
[42:27] God agreeing with what the Lord has to
[42:30] say about me about you about this church
[42:33] about the move of God I want to be in
[42:36] agreement with him moment to moment to
[42:39] moment sure we have battles sure we have
[42:42] things that come our way to try to make
[42:44] us doubt but oh God he he is he's my
[42:48] Lord is the one who is helping us to put
[42:50] our doubts under our feet and to rise up
[42:53] in faith to know he that has begun this
[42:57] work in me I've come too far to look
[42:59] back now come too far to look at all of

[49:04] Praise come on let's do it
[49:10] any good
[49:12] [Applause]
[49:14] he's wonderful
[49:17] he's wonderful and worthy to be praised
[49:20] you may be seated
[49:23] excuse me
[49:25] did you hear my computer
[49:28] brother Greeley was still singing on the
[49:30] computer there's a few a few seconds to
[49:32] lay
[49:35] the Lord is here
[49:38] Josh I want to tell you you did a
[49:40] marvelous exceptional anointed job
[49:44] thank you so much
[49:46] [Applause]
[49:49] we want to tell David how much we
[49:51] appreciate him jumping in on the base
[49:53] and I thought you did really good God
[49:55] bless you for that
[49:59] I know that that's not his comfort zone
[50:01] but he was willing this morning and God
[50:04] honored that and used it and I
[50:05] appreciate it very very much
[50:07] the Lord is good to us isn't he
[50:10] I'm sorry that I'm holding you up here
[50:13] just a minute but uh
[50:14] I I didn't take time I I guess the
[50:18] service came to me a little sooner than
[50:19] I was expecting somehow I don't know why
[50:21] it's about the right time
[50:23] and I wasn't quite ready I had a lot of
[50:26] things on my mind
[50:28] um I don't like to do such a thing as
[50:31] this and and disturb people I know some
[50:33] of you have small children and you can't
[50:35] really make a move but I'm wondering if
[50:37] we could have anybody to come anybody
[50:40] would come and just sit up close here is
[50:42] there anybody that would be willing to
[50:44] move up a little bit from the back and
[50:45] and just kind of fill in that little
[50:47] spot there this one time thank you all
[50:49] so much for doing that
[50:52] um I don't know why it's important but I
[50:54] just had the thought there either the
[50:56] second Pew or or whatever you want to do
[50:59] you can move I think maybe maybe Ashley
[51:01] and David were there I don't know but
[51:03] just whatever thank you all so much and
[51:06] we appreciate that
[51:08] um you know if I were you I would want
[51:12] to find this close of a place as I could
[51:14] if I didn't have small children to take
[51:16] care of it's always good the closer you
[51:19] get to the fire the warmer you can get
[51:21] right and um thank you so much for doing
[51:25] that without disturbance I really do
[51:27] appreciate it let me get this out of the
[51:29] way because I have an unusual uh message
[51:32] prepared
[51:33] uh charity
[51:35] uh this morning I print my notes I only
[51:40] have 20 pages of notes for today so
[51:43] we're doing good on time that usually
[51:46] takes about eight hours
[51:48] I can usually draw a series out of 20
[51:51] Pages for three weeks
[51:53] um but charity was putting all of the
[51:55] quotes in and I needed them all in
[51:57] sometime I don't need them all in but I
[52:00] needed them all in because I was so
[52:02] unsettled about which part of my sermon
[52:05] to preach first
[52:06] aren't you glad that you don't have that
[52:09] problem
[52:10] I don't have some of your problems on
[52:12] the job I I I've still not 100 settled I
[52:17] I've really got three I told charity two
[52:20] she said brother Shelley with all these
[52:23] quotes she said I better go home and
[52:24] change the timing on my oven for lunch
[52:28] and uh but I really got three separate
[52:33] and yet connected
[52:35] messages on my heart this morning and I
[52:38] don't know which one to start with
[52:40] I wished I had a mind that was a little
[52:42] more analytical although I find that
[52:45] that can be in hindrance to the
[52:46] supernatural but I wished I had a little
[52:49] bit more of an analytical mind if I did
[52:51] I could lay this out and I could say now
[52:53] this is the foundation and if I say that
[52:56] first then I could come in here and
[52:57] build on that and it'd get a little
[52:58] higher and then I could bring this but I
[53:01] don't have that kind of a mind and so I
[53:03] just have to do the best I can let me
[53:06] get out of the way uh get this out of
[53:08] the way and say that we have a few
[53:10] birthdays I want to mention this week
[53:12] and one is on Tuesday uh April the 19th
[53:16] sister Gabriella a long time friend of
[53:20] of my wife and I and sister Alfreda and
[53:23] this whole church she has a birthday on
[53:26] Tuesday she's not only a long time
[53:28] friend but a long time streamer and
[53:31] although we don't call her name out that
[53:33] often she's there and she's a part of
[53:37] what God has been doing here for such a
[53:39] long time and I remember uh her
[53:43] excitement I do I remember her
[53:45] excitement nearly 25 years ago when the
[53:48] message got to her that I was going to
[53:50] be married and she made her way all the
[53:52] way from Germany to be here for our
[53:53] wedding and I remember that and I I love
[53:56] that family on the 21st which is
[53:59] Thursday of this week Luke Jernigan has
[54:01] a birthday is that right where is Luke
[54:04] is that right you're going to be what 21
[54:07] on the 21st
[54:09] 17 on the 21st so God bless you
[54:17] I guess that's about four more years
[54:19] before we have to stop calling you
[54:20] lookie right and start calling you by a
[54:22] little bit more of an adult name and on
[54:25] Thursday of this week also is Nathan and
[54:28] shoshana's wedding anniversary how many
[54:30] is this four years happy anniversary to
[54:34] them both God bless you
[54:36] [Applause]
[54:39] we've had plenty of singing and um
[54:42] you know we didn't make any arrangements
[54:44] for an Easter egg hunt or anything like
[54:46] that this morning
[54:48] but I liked it that brother Greely
[54:50] mentioned that so many uh religious
[54:53] people
[54:54] uh go to church one day a year
[54:58] this is their day
[55:00] I pray that God will show up
[55:03] manifest himself and call every one of
[55:06] them to real salvation
[55:08] I know the Lord is certainly able to do
[55:10] that we're not Easter people here we
[55:14] believe in the resurrection but the
[55:16] resurrection is not a party it's not
[55:18] even a day it's a person Jesus said I am
[55:23] the resurrection and the life and I
[55:26] think what the world has called Easter
[55:28] is really a pagan uh doing really has
[55:32] very little to do with Christ it existed
[55:34] I think about all the precious sincere
[55:37] Christians who got up this morning all
[55:39] facing the Rising Sun just like the
[55:42] pagans did for thousands of years
[55:47] not even realizing that by the time the
[55:50] sun got up Jesus had already been out of
[55:53] the Grave for hours the scripture said
[55:56] so
[55:57] already been out of the Grave for hours
[55:59] and so you might as well just sleep in
[56:02] and come at the regular time and enjoy
[56:05] the goodness of the lord we used to do
[56:07] that and God met us because we were
[56:10] sincere and we didn't know exactly what
[56:13] we were doing but we don't show any no
[56:16] criticism or condemnation just don't
[56:18] expect us to have a big pageant here or
[56:21] something like that I don't think we
[56:22] sung one although I woke up this morning
[56:24] in the shower singing up from the grave
[56:27] Hill Rose
[56:29] we're the mighty Triumph or his foe
[56:35] foam in the dark domain and he lives
[56:38] forever with his Saints to Reign here
[56:42] arose here
[56:46] goes Hallelujah
[56:49] Christ arose
[56:53] you can't help but think about it but
[56:56] when we wake up in the morning we can
[56:58] sing the same song
[57:02] [Music]
[57:05] for so many years so many lamps
[57:11] were offered up
[57:15] and all the blood that was spilled could
[57:19] never feel that bitter cut
[57:24] up
[57:26] till one spotless lamb in the form of
[57:31] man gave his life on Calvary
[57:37] his was the only blood that could ever
[57:42] set men free
[57:46] [Music]
[57:48] for
[57:49] his blood was not just blood
[57:54] of another
[57:56] spotless
[57:59] lamb
[58:00] his blood was Precious Blood for it
[58:06] washed the sins
[58:09] man and his blood
[58:14] my body and it sets my spirit free
[58:22] I'm so glad this Precious Blood Still
[58:28] flows from Calvary

[58:38] could heal my broken body
[58:45] and no other blood
[58:48] could save my sin
[58:51] since its Souls
[58:57] no other blood
[58:59] could conquer death and win my story
[59:07] no other blood
[59:09] but the blood that Jesus
[59:12] sheds for me singing me with you for his
[59:20] blood was not just blood
[59:23] of another spot please

[1:03:36] God bless every one of you who are here
[1:03:38] this morning
[1:03:40] streaming this service returning to the
[1:03:42] Song of Solomon
[1:03:43] chapter 2
[1:03:46] beginning in verse 10.
[1:03:49] second Solomon excuse me second Solomon
[1:03:52] Song of Solomon Chapter 2.
[1:03:56] verse 10 God bless every one of you who
[1:03:58] are streaming this service this morning
[1:04:00] may the Lord meet you with his presence
[1:04:03] I pray something will be said that will
[1:04:06] help you bless you strengthen you along
[1:04:09] the way
[1:04:12] let me know when you're there
[1:04:16] my beloved spoke
[1:04:19] and said unto me
[1:04:21] rise up
[1:04:24] my love
[1:04:26] my fair one
[1:04:29] and come away
[1:04:31] next verse
[1:04:34] for law
[1:04:35] the winter
[1:04:37] is past
[1:04:40] the rain is over
[1:04:44] and gone
[1:04:46] you must understand that this was
[1:04:48] written in another land
[1:04:50] not ours
[1:04:53] in the land of the Bible winner is the
[1:04:57] rain
[1:04:58] in Alabama spring is the rain
[1:05:02] so when you read that the rain is over
[1:05:05] and gone you're reading about how it is
[1:05:07] in the land of the Bible
[1:05:09] and I want you to know this is the most
[1:05:11] exciting time
[1:05:13] uh botanically to be in Israel because
[1:05:16] there are more wildflowers in Israel
[1:05:19] than perhaps any nation in the world
[1:05:22] and they they take good care of them and
[1:05:25] protect them and the winner is by the
[1:05:29] time summer is over those those hills
[1:05:31] and mountains are so dry and so Barren
[1:05:35] and so bare
[1:05:37] that they look like desert
[1:05:39] but by the time the winter rains have
[1:05:42] come and the wind and the weather begins
[1:05:45] to warm up those mountains Break Forth
[1:05:48] with the most beautiful green and with
[1:05:51] the most beautiful puppies and so many
[1:05:55] wildflowers and even while it is yet
[1:05:57] cold the almonds begin to bloom their
[1:06:02] beautiful buds and announce to the whole
[1:06:05] land that winter is past
[1:06:09] the rain is over and gone
[1:06:14] the flowers appear on the Earth
[1:06:17] the time of the singing of birds is come
[1:06:22] and the voice of the turtle that's not
[1:06:26] the reptile that's the turtle dove and
[1:06:30] the voice of the turtle is heard in our
[1:06:34] land let me read those verses quickly
[1:06:37] again before you're seated my beloved
[1:06:40] spake and said unto me rise up my love
[1:06:45] my fair one and come away
[1:06:49] for law the winner is
[1:06:52] past
[1:06:53] the rain is over and
[1:06:57] gone the flowers appear on the earth the
[1:07:03] time Hallelujah
[1:07:04] the time of the singing of birds is come
[1:07:09] and the voice of the turtle
[1:07:12] is heard in our land father we want to
[1:07:16] thank you
[1:07:18] that you are God alive
[1:07:22] you are God's Supreme
[1:07:25] you are God right on time this morning
[1:07:30] I feel you now gathering around us
[1:07:34] by the presence of the Holy Spirit and I
[1:07:38] need you Lord you've laid some things on
[1:07:41] my heart to share and uh I need help
[1:07:45] with it it's one of those things where I
[1:07:49] really need your help and I thank you
[1:07:51] that you're coming even now to prepare
[1:07:54] our hearts for a prophetic word that
[1:07:57] comes from you today and we receive it
[1:08:00] Lord and we ask that you give your
[1:08:03] servant Grace to deliver it
[1:08:05] we just take authority over anything
[1:08:08] that would hinder the word and we ask
[1:08:11] God that you would uh open up our hearts
[1:08:14] and pour in the faith that we would just
[1:08:18] reach right up and be able to take you
[1:08:20] at your word and be helped be
[1:08:23] strengthened be encouraged be blessed
[1:08:26] and we'll give you the honor and the
[1:08:28] glory for it's in the name of the Lord
[1:08:31] Jesus Christ we pray amen and the saint
[1:08:35] said
[1:08:36] you may be seated
[1:08:40] I have not always been able
[1:08:45] to speak to you
[1:08:47] as I want to speak to you this morning
[1:08:51] there came a time when there was such
[1:08:55] skepticism
[1:08:58] it gets on us
[1:09:01] we went through a 10-year period
[1:09:06] of
[1:09:07] fellowship and association with
[1:09:12] a broader part of the church at Large
[1:09:16] we hosted
[1:09:18] conferences here and were blessed very
[1:09:23] blessed
[1:09:25] we understand that it was for a season
[1:09:29] and it served a purpose
[1:09:32] and there are many people watching this
[1:09:34] service and even a few here this morning
[1:09:37] because of that season of ministry that
[1:09:42] the lord gave us
[1:09:44] and we thank God for it I I really thank
[1:09:48] God for it he told us that we would give
[1:09:52] and we would receive
[1:09:54] and we have done that that was the
[1:09:56] graciousness and the mercy of Our Lord
[1:10:00] but we are on a fast track
[1:10:05] and the fast track has a lead car
[1:10:10] and the lead car has r o j c
[1:10:16] on it
[1:10:19] I don't know if anybody remembers that
[1:10:23] I can almost guarantee very few of you
[1:10:25] do
[1:10:26] by the look on your face
[1:10:28] but it was a dream
[1:10:31] that the lord gave me a clear dream
[1:10:34] and it was during that time
[1:10:38] and if we he told me in that dream that
[1:10:42] if I was going to be on the fast track I
[1:10:44] would have to follow the car that said
[1:10:47] r-o-j-c
[1:10:49] [Music]
[1:10:50] I said well Lord what is r-o-j-c he said
[1:10:54] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:10:57] that's what you got to follow
[1:10:59] and so I'm here this morning doing my
[1:11:03] best to follow that without a revelation
[1:11:06] of Jesus Christ we're just another
[1:11:09] church
[1:11:11] are you with me
[1:11:13] I want to give you a series of prophetic
[1:11:16] events
[1:11:18] I don't want to say before I preach I'm
[1:11:20] preaching now
[1:11:22] but before I really take a text
[1:11:25] if I would choose something out of the
[1:11:28] verses that I just read I would say
[1:11:30] winner is past
[1:11:33] and spring is appearing
[1:11:37] the birds are beginning to sing in the
[1:11:40] voice of the turtle dove is being heard
[1:11:43] again in our land I don't know if there
[1:11:46] are any C.S Lewis fans here or not
[1:11:50] but I have enjoyed the writings of C.S
[1:11:53] Lewis
[1:11:54] and I have recognized
[1:11:59] the prophetic nature
[1:12:01] of some of those writings
[1:12:04] and I have lived in the prophetic nature
[1:12:08] of some of those writings
[1:12:11] and I had three nights of Dreams this
[1:12:14] week that I won't go into the dreams
[1:12:17] this morning but Monday
[1:12:20] Tuesday and Wednesday night of this week
[1:12:23] I dreamed all three nights that we were
[1:12:28] in Narnia
[1:12:30] that make-believe land of C.S Lewis
[1:12:34] and what a battle we were involved in
[1:12:39] and there were
[1:12:41] all the creatures that you might imagine
[1:12:44] if any of you ever saw the adaptation
[1:12:48] the movies that were made
[1:12:51] uh I think by Disney
[1:12:55] of The Lion and the Witch and the
[1:12:57] Wardrobe and and uh The Voyage of the
[1:13:01] Dawn
[1:13:02] Treader and what was what was the last
[1:13:05] the next one or the the third of the
[1:13:07] three
[1:13:09] Prince Caspian
[1:13:13] um you will know this unusual these
[1:13:16] unusual creatures
[1:13:19] minotaurs and and other uh mythological
[1:13:23] type beasts well I have seen those
[1:13:28] in in dreams and experiences before I
[1:13:33] ever knew anything about the writings of
[1:13:36] C.S Lewis
[1:13:38] in the Holiness Church that I grew up in
[1:13:41] we were not encouraged to pursue such
[1:13:45] literature
[1:13:46] so I was a grown man nearly
[1:13:50] well age-wise I was for sure before I
[1:13:54] ever read them for myself
[1:13:57] now I'm not putting them on some high
[1:14:00] spiritual level I'm just saying by my
[1:14:04] own experiences I would say that C.S
[1:14:08] Lewis had more than just a overactive
[1:14:12] imagination
[1:14:14] I would say that he understood some
[1:14:18] things that a lot of people may or may
[1:14:21] not understand
[1:14:23] I want to give you a call
[1:14:25] and I believe charity has it that has
[1:14:29] meant something to me through the years
[1:14:31] from C.S Lewis and I'll tell you why in
[1:14:35] just a little bit
[1:14:36] wrong
[1:14:38] will be right
[1:14:41] when Aslan comes
[1:14:44] in sight
[1:14:46] if you are watching this and you're not
[1:14:48] familiar with Aslan
[1:14:50] he was the Magnificent lion
[1:14:55] that C.S Lewis wrote about
[1:14:58] and the lion was crucified
[1:15:03] murdered
[1:15:04] and rose again
[1:15:07] which certainly lets us know that he was
[1:15:11] written to be a type
[1:15:13] of a savior the Lord Jesus Christ so
[1:15:18] when I read about Aslan some of you are
[1:15:21] looking at me funny when I read about
[1:15:23] Aslan when I saw the films that were
[1:15:26] made
[1:15:27] I had no problem seeing him as the lion
[1:15:32] of the tribe of Judah
[1:15:34] the root and The Offspring of David this
[1:15:38] means a lot to me I'll share it with you
[1:15:40] again wrong will be right
[1:15:43] when Aslan comes in sight
[1:15:47] at the sound of his Roar
[1:15:50] Sorrows will be no more
[1:15:53] when he Bears his teeth
[1:16:00] winter meets
[1:16:03] its death
[1:16:05] and when he shakes his Mane
[1:16:09] we shall have spring
[1:16:13] again powerful anybody think that's
[1:16:16] powerful literature
[1:16:19] it's not only powerful but it's
[1:16:22] prophetic
[1:16:24] and it reminds me of the Song of Solomon
[1:16:28] winner is past
[1:16:30] the rain is gone and now the flowers
[1:16:35] appear in the earth and the sound of the
[1:16:39] birds singing and the turtle's voice is
[1:16:43] heard again in the land
[1:16:47] in order to explain to you just a little
[1:16:50] bit in the monitor
[1:16:52] in order to be able to explain to you
[1:16:55] what I mean
[1:16:57] I have to read from my dreams is that
[1:17:00] all right
[1:17:02] and then I will read from the writings
[1:17:04] of sister Isabel Weems
[1:17:08] but first from my own post
[1:17:12] on Facebook
[1:17:14] this was dated September the 8th
[1:17:18] 2010.
[1:17:21] 11 years ago soon nearly 11 years ago is
[1:17:27] that right
[1:17:29] soon 12.
[1:17:32] that's what it meant
[1:17:34] I dreamed I was in a land like Narnia
[1:17:37] last night
[1:17:39] a battle was brewing and Saints were
[1:17:42] weary
[1:17:43] and many had been taken captive by a
[1:17:46] spirit
[1:17:48] that had turned them into blocks of ice
[1:17:52] similar to the scene portrayed in the
[1:17:56] movie
[1:17:58] Miracles were beginning to happen Among
[1:18:01] Us
[1:18:02] and we were feeling waves of excitement
[1:18:07] from the distance
[1:18:10] whoo
[1:18:11] I lost my breath
[1:18:14] from a distance we heard a lion's roar
[1:18:19] and we began to shout as lands on the
[1:18:23] move
[1:18:25] Aslan is on the move
[1:18:29] shouts of Victory were heard in our camp
[1:18:34] and later I was just giving highlights
[1:18:37] for Facebook
[1:18:38] later he released his breath on us
[1:18:43] and we in turn were breathing over those
[1:18:48] who were frozen
[1:18:51] and Resurrection Life was being released
[1:18:56] anybody with me in the end it was about
[1:19:00] sitting still on the grass
[1:19:03] and hearing truths from aslan's mouth
[1:19:08] that would transfigure us
[1:19:11] and eventually translate us
[1:19:14] into a new kingdom
[1:19:17] so I ended the post by saying don't be
[1:19:19] weary Saints
[1:19:21] Aslan the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:19:27] is on the move
[1:19:28] I want to say to you today don't be
[1:19:31] weary Saints
[1:19:34] the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:19:37] is on the move
[1:19:38] if anybody believes that I want you to
[1:19:41] say Amen
[1:19:42] amen that's right we ought to give God
[1:19:45] praise
[1:19:49] now
[1:19:51] we had prayer directives
[1:19:54] weekly
[1:19:56] for many years
[1:19:58] and sister Carmen
[1:20:02] her family put them together and
[1:20:06] Jonathan Hollis
[1:20:08] helped and
[1:20:10] elfrida help sister Alfreda helped and
[1:20:13] others
[1:20:14] and when they were no longer
[1:20:17] in our ministry sister Weems
[1:20:21] she took on this huge job
[1:20:24] it's a huge job
[1:20:27] to put these together
[1:20:29] and I use them in my research oftentimes
[1:20:34] and I not only have them and use them
[1:20:36] but I use sister Nancy's
[1:20:38] because she wrote also a newsletter from
[1:20:43] Jerusalem that was filled with nuggets
[1:20:47] from our services here from sermon in
[1:20:51] fact the prayer directives and the
[1:20:54] Jerusalem updates
[1:20:56] uh contain some dreams and visions
[1:21:01] that are never mentioned anywhere else
[1:21:03] they're not even in our database
[1:21:06] so we are still trying to get some of
[1:21:10] those out
[1:21:11] so that they can be in the database I
[1:21:14] see I'm boring some of you
[1:21:16] this is not for you then
[1:21:18] so I'll just say sleep on this morning
[1:21:22] this is only for those who have a heart
[1:21:25] to hear I'm not trying to be ugly I'm
[1:21:27] trying to be as honest and sincere as I
[1:21:30] possibly know how
[1:21:31] there should be no reason why that we
[1:21:35] wouldn't have Liberty this morning to
[1:21:37] share these things it's a part of who we
[1:21:40] are it's a part of our spiritual DNA
[1:21:43] it's what sets us apart from all the
[1:21:46] other churches around our area here I'm
[1:21:48] just being honest
[1:21:50] I'm just being honest it's that little
[1:21:52] Edge that we want to give God praise for
[1:21:55] so that was September the 8th of 2010
[1:21:58] that I shared it it happened the night
[1:22:00] before
[1:22:02] and in the prayer directives
[1:22:06] sister Weems took from that post
[1:22:11] and from my telling I guess it would
[1:22:13] have been sister Weems in 2010
[1:22:16] from my telling of it in a service when
[1:22:19] I got home
[1:22:21] I was at the beach when this happened
[1:22:22] when I got home and told it
[1:22:25] this is what she wrote in the prayer
[1:22:27] directive in the prayer directives
[1:22:30] there is Warfare going on in the realm
[1:22:33] of the spirit for our future
[1:22:36] and our destiny
[1:22:38] a recent dream in Technicolor colorful
[1:22:43] dream that brother Shelley had showed a
[1:22:45] place
[1:22:46] similar to the scenes in the movies
[1:22:48] about Narnia
[1:22:50] he dreamed that a spirit had been loosed
[1:22:53] against the bride of Christ and was
[1:22:56] taking the Saints captive
[1:22:59] they were not bound with chains but they
[1:23:02] had been frozen
[1:23:05] he saw people he knew
[1:23:07] that he didn't expect to be in that
[1:23:09] condition
[1:23:11] and then he noticed that the Saints who
[1:23:14] were not frozen were dragging around so
[1:23:19] weary and tired that they were at the
[1:23:22] point of giving up
[1:23:24] there was a Warfare going on for our
[1:23:27] future and our destiny
[1:23:29] and then from the distance he heard the
[1:23:32] Roar of a lion
[1:23:34] so strong it made his ribs vibrate and
[1:23:38] the ground around him shook
[1:23:41] the prophets have spoken that God is
[1:23:44] releasing the courage and Valor of a
[1:23:47] lion to us in this hour
[1:23:51] when the lion began to Roar the people
[1:23:54] began to shout Aslan is on the move
[1:23:58] encouragement Came Upon every weary
[1:24:02] Soldier and people realize that we have
[1:24:05] not been forgotten and shouts of Victory
[1:24:08] begin to go up
[1:24:10] he said that Aslan breathed on us
[1:24:14] with this warm breath
[1:24:16] that had the most
[1:24:18] overpowering smell of roses
[1:24:22] brother Shelley then remembered our
[1:24:25] Frozen comrades and he went to breathe
[1:24:29] on them
[1:24:30] they thought out as resurrection power
[1:24:33] was released and would finish the
[1:24:35] sentence they were speaking when they
[1:24:38] had become Frozen
[1:24:40] they had received a resurrection life
[1:24:43] that transforms and transfigures us into
[1:24:48] the image of the Lord
[1:24:50] Aslan told our pastor that he would
[1:24:53] answer his question
[1:24:55] it was a question he had brought to the
[1:24:57] Lord before he went to sleep that night
[1:24:59] he went on to tell us that we climbed up
[1:25:02] to a high place and Aslan began to talk
[1:25:06] we sat in the grass and listened to the
[1:25:09] truths that were coming out of his mouth
[1:25:11] truths that would transform us and
[1:25:14] translate us into a new kingdom Miracles
[1:25:18] broke out which encouraged us to
[1:25:22] demonstrate the power of God everyone
[1:25:24] was feeling waves of excitement brother
[1:25:27] Shelley knew that the most desirable
[1:25:29] place for us to be in this hour was to
[1:25:32] be in grass with Aslan he encouraged Us
[1:25:37] by saying don't be weary because Aslan
[1:25:40] is on the move he is demonstrating his
[1:25:42] power the new model hear this the new
[1:25:46] model of ministry that is coming is the
[1:25:50] demonstration of the spoken word
[1:25:55] that was the answer to the question
[1:25:57] everything else is getting us there
[1:26:02] it's so important in this hour to come
[1:26:05] into agreement with God's word in
[1:26:07] everything I'm still reading from the
[1:26:09] prayer directives
[1:26:11] and then the next section the racetrack
[1:26:14] dream
[1:26:15] in another dream the next night
[1:26:18] he saw that we were going to a racetrack
[1:26:20] race
[1:26:22] and as we were going up the hill putting
[1:26:24] on our helmets
[1:26:25] an official looking man said not this
[1:26:28] time
[1:26:30] the pastor spoke up what do you mean
[1:26:32] that's our racetrack
[1:26:35] the man looked at him with a compassion
[1:26:37] and said you can't race on that track
[1:26:41] because the Lord wants you on the fast
[1:26:44] track
[1:26:45] when they arrived at the fast track he
[1:26:49] saw cars lined up but he didn't
[1:26:51] recognize his car so the man pointed to
[1:26:55] it and on the side of the race car it
[1:26:59] said r o j c
[1:27:04] the man was saying that on the fast
[1:27:06] track the car would have to be
[1:27:11] now in dream life
[1:27:15] cars represent Ministries
[1:27:19] transportation in a dream usually
[1:27:22] represents a Ministry or a demonstration
[1:27:26] of ministry
[1:27:29] the man was saying that on the fast
[1:27:31] track the car would have to be the
[1:27:33] revelation of Jesus Christ and in
[1:27:36] parentheses she put brother Branham
[1:27:38] preached the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:27:40] series
[1:27:42] but we can also say now that the entire
[1:27:46] message that the Lord has given to us in
[1:27:49] our day that whole message is the
[1:27:52] revealing
[1:27:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ he no longer
[1:27:57] hides behind the lattice he no longer
[1:28:00] hides in the shadows but he is now
[1:28:03] unveiled apocalypses he has now unveiled
[1:28:07] himself and revealed himself to his
[1:28:11] people
[1:28:13] sister Weems went on to write
[1:28:15] the two dreams are connected
[1:28:19] because Aslan who represents Christ
[1:28:24] was telling truths to transform us and
[1:28:29] translate us into a new kingdom
[1:28:32] in order for the bride to come into her
[1:28:35] promised Revival
[1:28:37] we'll have to have a true revelation of
[1:28:40] end time events God is not going to lead
[1:28:45] his bride blindly
[1:28:48] we won't move into the bride's Revival
[1:28:51] that spoken word Revival until enough
[1:28:54] people get a revelation of what it's
[1:28:57] really about God is going to give us a
[1:29:01] clear understanding of how things are
[1:29:04] going to be because he wants his people
[1:29:06] to know what will transpire the new
[1:29:11] model of ministry is the spoken word
[1:29:16] everything else is getting us there can
[1:29:20] anybody say Amen now that prayer
[1:29:23] directive was from September the 11th of
[1:29:28] 2010 and on May the 12th
[1:29:32] 2011 I posted that a quote that we just
[1:29:36] read you of C.S Lewis
[1:29:40] three nights Monday night Tuesday night
[1:29:43] Wednesday night of this week I dream
[1:29:46] battle scenes from uh narnia-like land
[1:29:52] I saw there were times that the army of
[1:29:56] light was winning
[1:29:59] I mean they were taking ground and
[1:30:03] pushing the enemy back and then there
[1:30:06] were times that the that the Army of
[1:30:09] Darkness
[1:30:10] would come and start
[1:30:12] encroaching and taking bits and uh
[1:30:17] pieces of land that had been
[1:30:21] occupied by God's people
[1:30:24] and little by little it was happening so
[1:30:28] subtly
[1:30:29] so
[1:30:32] uh in such small increments I hope
[1:30:35] you'll bear with me
[1:30:37] that we didn't realize how much ground
[1:30:41] had been lost
[1:30:43] because this enemy was just taking
[1:30:45] little pieces and little pieces and
[1:30:47] little pieces and little piece this is
[1:30:49] how the enemy does the Bible are you
[1:30:51] with me
[1:30:53] the Bible said the little foxes what do
[1:30:56] they do they small the vine it's not the
[1:31:00] big old wolves that come marching in
[1:31:02] breathing hot air it's those little
[1:31:04] things that the enemy uses to take our
[1:31:06] ground
[1:31:08] and to encroach Upon Our Authority and
[1:31:10] our power and we're really backing up
[1:31:12] and we don't even realize that we're
[1:31:14] backing up giving ground
[1:31:17] that doesn't belong to the enemy it's
[1:31:20] the bride's inheritance
[1:31:22] I want to say to you today that the
[1:31:25] power and the authority to use the
[1:31:28] spoken word is the inheritance of the
[1:31:31] Bride of Jesus Christ and we're going to
[1:31:35] move in that
[1:31:37] before we get out of here
[1:31:39] are you with me
[1:31:41] so that was Monday Tuesday and Wednesday
[1:31:45] night dreaming dreaming all night waking
[1:31:48] up tired
[1:31:51] because we fought all night
[1:31:55] there are a lot of little things I could
[1:31:57] share but it doesn't matter
[1:32:00] because in the last dream
[1:32:03] I saw an ultimate victory
[1:32:06] and it was because of this other dream
[1:32:10] that came into play it I was reminded
[1:32:12] when I woke up it was the fact that
[1:32:15] Aslan was on the move again
[1:32:17] and he had on purpose
[1:32:19] held his peace while winter was doing
[1:32:24] its thing
[1:32:25] but in the spring when winter was over
[1:32:29] those long dark winners
[1:32:33] that President Biden spoke about during
[1:32:37] the
[1:32:39] pandemic
[1:32:41] those long dark deadly
[1:32:45] mournful sad winners
[1:32:49] we're coming to an end
[1:32:51] and spring was springing up
[1:32:54] and birds were singing again
[1:33:00] on Thursday of this week after dreaming
[1:33:03] that
[1:33:06] we went to Montgomery for some wedding
[1:33:08] business
[1:33:09] and
[1:33:11] on the way home brother Daniel Miller
[1:33:14] sent a text
[1:33:16] and he said brother Shelley will there
[1:33:18] be any way
[1:33:19] that you could in the next couple of
[1:33:22] days go and look at a house
[1:33:25] for us
[1:33:28] and see if it's something that we we
[1:33:30] should rent
[1:33:32] and I said sure in fact we're leaving
[1:33:36] Montgomery now and we can go by and look
[1:33:39] at this house
[1:33:40] was easy to find
[1:33:42] very close to Tiger Town
[1:33:47] and
[1:33:49] in the meantime I said well we can look
[1:33:51] in the windows and see the neighborhood
[1:33:53] and things like that did you want us to
[1:33:56] try to make an appointment to go inside
[1:33:59] and he said well yes he said in fact I'm
[1:34:02] trying to set that up right now I was
[1:34:04] going to have the agent there and offer
[1:34:08] you an opportunity to go in and look and
[1:34:10] maybe even give us a virtual tour
[1:34:13] I said sure I can do that now I had a
[1:34:17] hard time knowing how to run the phone
[1:34:19] I'm going to go ahead and tell you
[1:34:21] before my kids tell you
[1:34:23] my boys they kept saying no Daddy no
[1:34:27] Daddy no that ain't the right daddy that
[1:34:28] ain't the right way you got to do you
[1:34:30] got to do it this way I couldn't get it
[1:34:32] to turn around right and and then I
[1:34:34] realized I'm just doing like this
[1:34:38] it was some Tour all right
[1:34:42] the little fellow was was Korean and he
[1:34:45] didn't want to touch us
[1:34:47] he was afraid he would give him virus
[1:34:49] and it was just an unusual kind of thing
[1:34:53] all together just an unusual kind of
[1:34:55] thing
[1:34:57] but a kind of a nice house a very nice
[1:35:00] neighborhood and very convenient only
[1:35:02] about 23 minutes from here
[1:35:04] and um
[1:35:07] we were waiting on the agent to get
[1:35:09] there
[1:35:11] and so I went for a walk my boys were
[1:35:14] grumbling
[1:35:16] because it was taking too long and we've
[1:35:19] been waiting longer than we should have
[1:35:20] and
[1:35:21] I thought I don't have to sit here and
[1:35:23] listen to this bellyaching
[1:35:26] it's a beautiful spring day I'll just go
[1:35:29] walk up and down the road here
[1:35:31] so I walked up the road and walked back
[1:35:33] down the road and I didn't hear a bird
[1:35:35] anywhere
[1:35:38] but this the Sun was shining and
[1:35:41] it was just a beautiful day it was there
[1:35:43] was a nice breeze
[1:35:45] and all of a sudden I
[1:35:48] either brother Daniel I think brother
[1:35:50] Daniel called me and he didn't want me
[1:35:52] to have to wait too long
[1:35:54] and all of a sudden I'm standing out in
[1:35:56] the middle of the road and he calls
[1:36:00] and there is a bird
[1:36:03] several Birds
[1:36:05] that come out of nowhere
[1:36:08] I hadn't seen a bird
[1:36:11] they come out of nowhere and they come
[1:36:13] like torpedoes
[1:36:16] not Birds
[1:36:18] they come flying toward me so fast
[1:36:22] that I had to move
[1:36:25] to keep from being hit
[1:36:27] and they landed on a limb of a tree
[1:36:30] right near where I was standing and you
[1:36:32] have never heard such singing they
[1:36:34] weren't angry
[1:36:35] they just sang a concert
[1:36:39] and I thought I I'm not going to mention
[1:36:41] that I'm not going to mention what just
[1:36:43] happened but this is a little unusual to
[1:36:45] get bombarded by by birds three or four
[1:36:48] Birds almost knocked me over trying to
[1:36:51] get away from them and now they're
[1:36:52] sitting just a few feet away on a limb
[1:36:54] and they're all looking at me like they
[1:36:57] have been sent here to give me a concert
[1:36:59] and they were so loud
[1:37:03] that I think I better move away because
[1:37:06] I can hardly concentrate and brother
[1:37:08] brother Daniel said oh I can hear the
[1:37:11] birds singing
[1:37:13] and I laughed I said I guess you can
[1:37:17] I didn't even tell him what had just
[1:37:19] happened
[1:37:20] as I started walking back to the vehicle
[1:37:23] the scripture came to me just out of the
[1:37:27] blue it seemed winter is past
[1:37:32] the rains
[1:37:34] are gone
[1:37:36] the flowers appear in the land and the
[1:37:40] time of the singing of the birds
[1:37:43] is come
[1:37:45] I said Lord thank you
[1:37:47] thank you for that little confirmation
[1:37:50] for me
[1:37:52] that you are really doing something
[1:37:56] and I want to be a part of it I don't
[1:37:59] want to miss it I want to see Frozen
[1:38:02] Saints unthawed
[1:38:06] I want to see the living breath of the
[1:38:10] Lion of the tribe of Judah deliver and
[1:38:13] liberate and set God's people free
[1:38:17] so I said Lord I'm taking this as a sign
[1:38:20] from you now I hesitate to say these
[1:38:24] things
[1:38:25] and one of the reasons why I do is
[1:38:27] because it has been said that these
[1:38:30] things that we mention like this are
[1:38:32] sensationalism
[1:38:34] so I have been really reluctant
[1:38:38] for a long time
[1:38:40] to really share what it means for me to
[1:38:43] live for him daily
[1:38:45] but I want you to know it's a daily
[1:38:47] Adventure
[1:38:48] when you serve the Lord he don't go away
[1:38:51] till you come back to church on Sunday
[1:38:54] he's with you every day and if you have
[1:38:58] ears to hear and ask to see you'll see
[1:39:01] him you'll hear him you'll recognize
[1:39:04] that he is with you
[1:39:10] so that was Thursday
[1:39:13] so Monday Tuesday Wednesday dream Narnia
[1:39:16] battles
[1:39:17] was reminded of this experience the
[1:39:20] breath
[1:39:21] breathing on the Frozen Saints
[1:39:25] they were halfway into a into a
[1:39:28] statement when the when the freeze came
[1:39:32] and as soon as the breath was blown on
[1:39:35] them
[1:39:36] they very quickly defrosted and thought
[1:39:40] out and they finished the sentence
[1:39:43] that lets me know that the enemy came in
[1:39:47] in such an unexpected way
[1:39:50] so suddenly so to speak that people were
[1:39:53] paralyzed and frozen out
[1:39:56] missing what what life is really
[1:39:59] supposed to be about if you know
[1:40:01] anything about the lion and the witch in
[1:40:03] The Wardrobe in the story you you come
[1:40:06] into a winter wonderland it looks like
[1:40:08] but it's really a land that has been in
[1:40:11] a winner for years
[1:40:14] because of power uh in the in yes in the
[1:40:18] book in the story a witch a power has
[1:40:22] taken over this land and has plunged it
[1:40:26] into an eternal winter time
[1:40:30] but oh what a difference can be made
[1:40:33] when God begins to move again
[1:40:36] and Aslan begins to move again the story
[1:40:40] was he'd gone away
[1:40:42] for a long time and now he had come back
[1:40:46] to deal with winter I'm so thankful
[1:40:50] for the whole analogy and and the whole
[1:40:53] the whole paradigm that God really began
[1:40:57] to talk to me about over 12 years ago so
[1:41:00] Friday morning I woke up are you still
[1:41:02] here
[1:41:03] Friday morning I woke up April 15th
[1:41:09] I was supposed to have lunch with
[1:41:11] someone here in the church
[1:41:14] but I realized that I
[1:41:16] was not quite ready to file my extension
[1:41:21] it was April 15th
[1:41:24] tomorrow is the deadline the 18th this
[1:41:27] year
[1:41:28] but I needed to make sure that I got
[1:41:31] that done it was kind of Weighing on me
[1:41:33] heavy
[1:41:34] and in order to do that I was going to
[1:41:36] have to give them some money
[1:41:38] and I didn't want to give them any money
[1:41:42] when I looked down and see how much I've
[1:41:44] already given them
[1:41:46] but my wife's income is 10.99
[1:41:51] and so we have to pay taxes on that
[1:41:54] every year
[1:41:55] uh so we went from refunds to paying
[1:41:58] taxes because there's nothing taken out
[1:42:01] on that and it can really be a chunk
[1:42:05] and even though her income from the oils
[1:42:08] is way way down from what it was it's
[1:42:11] still a chunk of taxes
[1:42:14] and she saves it in her in in her money
[1:42:17] and but I just hate giving it to him
[1:42:21] [Music]
[1:42:22] I just don't think they deserve it
[1:42:26] so I put it off and put it off and put
[1:42:28] it all and finally give it to him at the
[1:42:30] last minute you can't even really file
[1:42:32] an extension properly without paying
[1:42:34] them what you owe them
[1:42:36] you can set up some arrangements but
[1:42:39] some people think if you file an
[1:42:40] extension that means you can wait to pay
[1:42:42] your taxes but that's not what it means
[1:42:44] at all it means you go ahead and pay
[1:42:46] what you think you owe
[1:42:49] and if it comes out that you don't
[1:42:51] you're going to pay penalty and interest
[1:42:53] already on top of that
[1:42:55] so I rushed over here my wife had put
[1:42:57] the money in my account and I rest over
[1:43:00] here and
[1:43:01] and what's going to get that done and I
[1:43:04] knew I wouldn't make my lunch
[1:43:05] appointment and I knew I had to take
[1:43:06] Benjamin to the airport in Columbus to
[1:43:10] fly out to Dallas for the weekend and so
[1:43:12] I had all these things in my mind
[1:43:15] and I'm driving along on my way to the
[1:43:17] office and the spirit of the Lord says
[1:43:19] what day is it
[1:43:21] I said oh it's Friday I I know that
[1:43:24] because I just put out my text
[1:43:27] so it's Friday
[1:43:28] [Music]
[1:43:30] and the Lord said
[1:43:31] to my heart to my spirit
[1:43:34] you know if you hear him that way if he
[1:43:36] talks to you in an internal voice
[1:43:37] sometime you know what it's like
[1:43:40] it can come like a very very strong
[1:43:42] thought but you realize I'm not thinking
[1:43:45] like this
[1:43:46] I wouldn't think to ask myself such a
[1:43:48] question like this so This thought comes
[1:43:51] and said well what what month is it
[1:43:54] and I said well it's April
[1:43:56] I said it's April it's Friday in April
[1:44:01] and then I I said out loud
[1:44:04] it's getting close to my birthday
[1:44:08] and I'm going to be 54. ain't that grand
[1:44:11] that's what I said
[1:44:14] and the Lord said what's the date
[1:44:17] and I said I I
[1:44:20] uh
[1:44:23] it's in the teens
[1:44:27] I glanced over at my phone
[1:44:31] and saw that it was April the 15th
[1:44:35] so I said it's tax day
[1:44:39] and I'm on my way
[1:44:42] you know to pay my taxes
[1:44:44] on April the 15th
[1:44:47] and the spirit of the Lord said what
[1:44:48] else
[1:44:50] I said I don't know
[1:44:53] I don't know
[1:44:55] you said what did you dream
[1:44:57] for three nights I said well I had
[1:44:59] Narnia dreams
[1:45:01] we were in battles
[1:45:03] and Aslan came and saved us encouraged
[1:45:06] us and I'm talking out loud if you ever
[1:45:09] see me going down the road I'm either
[1:45:11] talking on the phone or talking out loud
[1:45:13] to myself
[1:45:14] we don't think I'm crazy just yet
[1:45:17] I said yes I had a Monday night Tuesday
[1:45:20] night Wednesday night I had those dreams
[1:45:22] and then yesterday I I had a bird bomb
[1:45:27] and the birds were singing and the
[1:45:29] spirit of the Lord reminded me that
[1:45:31] winter is past and spring is springing
[1:45:34] and the birds are singing
[1:45:37] and all of a sudden the spirit of the
[1:45:39] Lord said don't you remember
[1:45:42] that it was on April the 15th
[1:45:46] that Chuck Pierce gave you and your wife
[1:45:52] the prophecy
[1:46:00] no I didn't remember
[1:46:02] I didn't
[1:46:03] I came over to the church and I did a
[1:46:06] search
[1:46:08] and I found the file three times
[1:46:11] we have
[1:46:15] combined and deleted thousands of files
[1:46:19] but there were still three files
[1:46:22] of this experience
[1:46:24] and every one of them was dated 315.
[1:46:30] and I said
[1:46:32] I don't know how that's possible
[1:46:37] because
[1:46:38] I felt like the Lord was saying it was 4
[1:46:41] 15. today
[1:46:44] so I had to do some research and the
[1:46:46] date had been put in wrong
[1:46:49] and I was able to go back thank God for
[1:46:53] good notes
[1:46:54] I was able to go back and find that I
[1:46:59] was not in Maryland in March of that
[1:47:02] year I was there in April
[1:47:05] and after I found that I went on
[1:47:08] Facebook memories how many of you ever
[1:47:10] used that and I had taken a picture of
[1:47:13] Chuck
[1:47:15] just as he walked over to us to give us
[1:47:18] this Prophecy 4 15 2011.
[1:47:23] so I want to share it with you that are
[1:47:25] awake
[1:47:27] is that all right
[1:47:29] it was in Frederick Maryland
[1:47:32] at Cornerstone Fellowship
[1:47:34] where Paul and Cheryl black who have
[1:47:37] been here uh to visit
[1:47:39] a pastor
[1:47:42] he said and this conference was called
[1:47:45] forging your future
[1:47:48] from The Unseen Realm
[1:47:51] it's one of the most powerful
[1:47:52] conferences that we did in Maryland
[1:47:55] and Chuck was speaking that morning
[1:47:59] and he walked over to Stacy and I and he
[1:48:01] had not yet been here
[1:48:03] he was scheduled to come to us that year
[1:48:07] and remember there was that whole thing
[1:48:09] about the GPS do any of you remember
[1:48:12] they almost didn't find the church
[1:48:15] and he started in to tell us we ought to
[1:48:18] get that fixed and then caught itself
[1:48:21] and told me later there's a reason for
[1:48:23] all things just leave it like that
[1:48:26] he felt like it was even at that time
[1:48:28] connected to what he had given us 415
[1:48:32] 2011.
[1:48:34] 2011 was one of the busiest years of my
[1:48:36] life
[1:48:37] I was traveling everywhere preaching I
[1:48:41] was also in Israel during that time
[1:48:43] there were a lot of things going on in
[1:48:45] 2011. this is the transcript of that of
[1:48:50] that word
[1:48:51] he said what I see with you two is
[1:48:55] you have a great church history
[1:48:59] and a great church setting
[1:49:02] and because of that God's going to take
[1:49:06] that place and make it a church
[1:49:10] in a different dimension
[1:49:16] does that sound too Sensational for you
[1:49:20] you know I never thought about the
[1:49:22] supernatural being sensational
[1:49:26] it's just Supernatural
[1:49:29] but it is Sensational when God does what
[1:49:31] he says
[1:49:33] but that's not the criticism
[1:49:35] and because of that God's going to take
[1:49:38] that place and make it a church in a
[1:49:41] different dimension
[1:49:44] we'll walk in all of a sudden they're
[1:49:47] going to say I'm not sure where I'm at
[1:49:56] you can laugh
[1:49:58] many people have already said this
[1:50:02] some people said I thought I had
[1:50:04] stumbled into the Mayflower
[1:50:06] because you people dress like pilgrims
[1:50:11] he said when people walk in all of a
[1:50:15] sudden they're going to say I'm not sure
[1:50:17] where I'm at and listen at this next
[1:50:19] statement it's going to be like walking
[1:50:24] into Narnia
[1:50:29] now I tell you he had no way of knowing
[1:50:34] that in 2010 I had had all those
[1:50:38] experiences with Narnia
[1:50:41] he had no way of knowing that
[1:50:43] we had never spoken about it
[1:50:46] and you know he said oh are you reading
[1:50:49] that book
[1:50:53] he said I just saw it by the spirit
[1:50:57] the Lord just said
[1:51:00] she spoke out Stacy spoke out and said
[1:51:03] I'm reading that book
[1:51:07] now this is not in the prophecy but but
[1:51:10] I also have here where I told the
[1:51:12] prophecy I won't bother you with that
[1:51:13] lose you but I will tell you this I did
[1:51:17] not want her to bring that book
[1:51:21] you anybody remember that
[1:51:23] the mcwhators had given us me I think a
[1:51:29] birthday card with a gift card from
[1:51:34] Barnes and Noble
[1:51:36] and I didn't even go in Barnes and Noble
[1:51:38] anymore because you can just order books
[1:51:40] and get them and I didn't I didn't go in
[1:51:42] there but we went in I didn't need
[1:51:44] anything and we found a big old
[1:51:48] paperback copy about that big
[1:51:51] of the collection of C.S Lewis's works
[1:51:56] and my wife said I'd like to get that so
[1:51:58] that's what we spent the gift card on
[1:52:01] but it was huge
[1:52:04] and when we started to go out the door
[1:52:06] that morning she said I'm going to go
[1:52:08] get my book I said that old thing
[1:52:11] I said isn't that a little big for the
[1:52:13] airplane she said no
[1:52:16] I want to read it
[1:52:18] and I'll have more time to read it while
[1:52:20] I'm gone
[1:52:22] so she had even read it that morning
[1:52:25] while I Was preparing for the service
[1:52:28] later that day she had already been
[1:52:30] reading in that book that morning so
[1:52:33] Chuck didn't know that
[1:52:35] he said I just saw it by the spirit the
[1:52:38] Lord just said
[1:52:40] she said she is reading that book she
[1:52:43] spoke it out and he repeated it he said
[1:52:45] it's going to be like walking into
[1:52:47] Narnia and they're going to say wait a
[1:52:49] minute
[1:52:51] I was just out the door here and I've
[1:52:53] walked in here and I thought I was just
[1:52:55] coming to church
[1:52:59] because
[1:53:01] church history is important
[1:53:04] and good churches are important
[1:53:08] and listen to what Chuck said he said
[1:53:10] and that's who they are
[1:53:13] that's not Who We Are
[1:53:16] Chuck was speaking about them himself
[1:53:19] his movement
[1:53:21] the people that follow him and and uh he
[1:53:25] said that's who they are that's not Who
[1:53:28] We Are
[1:53:29] you see in that movement they always
[1:53:32] emphasize Kingdom
[1:53:36] and so in order to do that they
[1:53:39] minimalize
[1:53:41] I've been in the meetings they
[1:53:43] minimalize the idea of church
[1:53:47] they do
[1:53:48] because their focus is Kingdom but now
[1:53:52] listen to this
[1:53:54] he said that's who they are that's not
[1:53:56] who we are and in the midst of it you
[1:53:58] know it's early it's just 12 50.
[1:54:00] and in the midst of it the people are
[1:54:03] going to walk in and say I'm in a
[1:54:05] different world
[1:54:06] Lord
[1:54:10] I'm in a different place here
[1:54:19] and the Lord says
[1:54:21] you are going to create a model that
[1:54:25] causes people to understand Kingdom
[1:54:30] from church
[1:54:36] as powerful
[1:54:39] because this is not what they were
[1:54:41] teaching
[1:54:43] he said that's a little hard to do
[1:54:46] because Church you build it for one
[1:54:51] season
[1:54:53] he said that's what the Bible talks
[1:54:54] about you build Church you unlock the
[1:54:57] kingdom
[1:54:59] he looked right at us and he said so
[1:55:02] that means your church that you have
[1:55:05] built will become an unlocking place
[1:55:11] Hallelujah
[1:55:13] Hallelujah
[1:55:15] Hallelujah can't you clap better than
[1:55:17] that
[1:55:20] let it be so Lord
[1:55:23] let it be so Lord
[1:55:26] that's what I wanted to be
[1:55:29] you see that in itself directly relates
[1:55:33] to a prophetic experience
[1:55:36] where we saw the nations of the world
[1:55:39] locked the saints of God in Africa
[1:55:42] locked in cages
[1:55:45] walking around in bird cages
[1:55:48] their feet hanging out they could move
[1:55:51] around but they couldn't get rid of
[1:55:52] these cages
[1:55:55] and the keys were held in a display case
[1:55:59] in the vestibule of a message Church
[1:56:05] and God by his grace gave authority
[1:56:09] to bust out the keys
[1:56:12] so that the Saints could be burst out of
[1:56:16] their cages
[1:56:17] so for someone to come years later and
[1:56:20] say this is to be an unlocking place
[1:56:24] it's exactly confirmation for what we
[1:56:27] have believed for anybody with us
[1:56:30] he said now what I'm trying to do I put
[1:56:33] Pro put vocabulary to where we're at
[1:56:35] right now I've never prophesied this to
[1:56:38] anybody
[1:56:41] he said and so if you're reading Narnia
[1:56:44] now listen to this
[1:56:45] he said so if you're reading Narnia
[1:56:47] you're supposed to find out listen I I
[1:56:51] just said that didn't I
[1:56:53] you're supposed to find out what you're
[1:56:55] going to look like
[1:56:58] in days ahead
[1:57:01] so if you're reading Narnia
[1:57:04] you're supposed to find out what you're
[1:57:07] going to look like in days ahead and the
[1:57:10] wars
[1:57:11] that will be going on
[1:57:13] in there
[1:57:15] in the book
[1:57:17] and in days ahead
[1:57:19] in a church that's supposed to reveal
[1:57:21] Kingdom and be established as an
[1:57:24] unlocking place where people will come
[1:57:27] in and say I was just going into church
[1:57:29] and now I find myself in another world
[1:57:32] anybody with me well are you really
[1:57:35] preaching the word are you just
[1:57:37] preaching about our church I'm doing all
[1:57:39] of that
[1:57:40] because somebody needs to
[1:57:43] we need to be reminded that we have a
[1:57:46] commission
[1:57:47] [Music]
[1:57:47] [Applause]
[1:57:49] and a role to fill
[1:57:52] that's bigger than Lee County Alabama
[1:57:55] are you with me now listen you're
[1:57:58] supposed to find out what you're going
[1:58:00] to look like in days ahead and the wars
[1:58:02] that will be going on in there and
[1:58:03] listen
[1:58:06] and when you get to the last battle
[1:58:12] which happens to be one of the last
[1:58:14] books
[1:58:15] in the series
[1:58:18] it is the last book
[1:58:21] and when you get to the last battle
[1:58:24] which battle last one
[1:58:27] is he talking about a book
[1:58:31] he is
[1:58:34] it is when you read the last battle when
[1:58:37] you get to the last battle of the book
[1:58:40] but he's not just talking about the book
[1:58:43] this is symbolism
[1:58:45] you should know this by now he's talking
[1:58:48] about the last battle does anybody
[1:58:50] remember what the last battle was
[1:58:55] the Branham not only said it's the
[1:58:57] greatest battle ever fought he said it's
[1:58:59] a last battle the bride will ever have
[1:59:01] to fight
[1:59:02] the Battlefield of the Mind anybody
[1:59:04] getting it now
[1:59:06] he said when you come when you get to
[1:59:09] the last battle you're going to
[1:59:11] understand
[1:59:14] when you get to the last battle you're
[1:59:18] going to understand
[1:59:19] this is who we were meant to be
[1:59:23] this is are you listening this is who we
[1:59:27] were meant to be this is who we were
[1:59:31] meant to be he said all right now that's
[1:59:32] the word for you now because we're in
[1:59:35] the spirit up here the spirit of God is
[1:59:37] up here thank you all for creating an
[1:59:39] environment for the spirit of God to be
[1:59:42] here
[1:59:44] so because of what God was saying and
[1:59:47] doing it even shifted the environment of
[1:59:50] where we were in Frederick Maryland and
[1:59:53] God did some mighty beautiful things in
[1:59:57] that series of meetings
[2:00:01] I I would like if I if I had the time I
[2:00:05] don't but if I had the time I would read
[2:00:09] some from the transcript
[2:00:11] of telling that experience here
[2:00:14] because I realize that there are people
[2:00:17] here who have never heard that let me
[2:00:19] just ask you if you've never heard it in
[2:00:21] that much detail you're part of this
[2:00:23] church and you've never heard any of
[2:00:25] that in that much detail just hold up
[2:00:26] your hand and let me see your hand for
[2:00:28] just a minute so that's quite a few
[2:00:30] people don't you think these people have
[2:00:32] a right to know what God has said
[2:00:36] now I want to read something before we
[2:00:39] move on and I'll hurry I am hurrying
[2:00:41] this is me in hurry mode
[2:00:43] I God led me some years back
[2:00:47] to the writings of Wade Taylor
[2:00:53] and I never got to meet Wade in person
[2:00:55] before he passed away
[2:00:57] but I spoke with him several times on
[2:01:00] the phone
[2:01:02] and he reached out to me in email
[2:01:06] because he had been given a message
[2:01:10] that I had preached in Frederick
[2:01:12] Maryland by the way
[2:01:15] concerning the intimacy of the Bride
[2:01:18] and what we spoke about a few weeks ago
[2:01:21] just a little piece of that the the the
[2:01:23] tokens the proof the tokens of virginity
[2:01:28] the proof that the bride and the
[2:01:31] bridegroom have come together he heard
[2:01:33] that tape
[2:01:35] and he said I want to reach out to you
[2:01:38] and let you know the impact that that
[2:01:40] has had on me
[2:01:42] he was an author some of you know that
[2:01:44] he wrote a series of books all really
[2:01:48] powerful books
[2:01:51] this one is called The Secret of the
[2:01:54] stairs has anybody read it I've read it
[2:01:57] all the way through a few of you have
[2:01:58] read it
[2:01:59] the thing that I like about
[2:02:02] brother Wade Taylor's writings is it's
[2:02:05] filled with the scripture
[2:02:08] it's not just out on a limb somewhere
[2:02:10] it's so scriptural
[2:02:13] and he even had a devotional that's
[2:02:17] really really nice
[2:02:19] you might want to read that sometime
[2:02:21] look at that sometime
[2:02:24] but I want to read you two paragraphs
[2:02:26] from from the secret of the stairs
[2:02:29] he said the bride has made a major
[2:02:33] breakthrough
[2:02:36] the winter is past
[2:02:39] and the flowers are beginning to appear
[2:02:43] he goes on to Define what a spiritual
[2:02:46] winner is he said a spiritual winner is
[2:02:50] a time in which the Lord is seemingly
[2:02:54] absent
[2:02:57] let me ask you a question has anybody
[2:02:59] ever had a spiritual winner
[2:03:01] let me see your hand
[2:03:04] a time where it felt like the Lord was
[2:03:07] absent now how many of you know better
[2:03:09] than that
[2:03:12] Lo I'll be with you what always
[2:03:16] even when I don't see him
[2:03:20] he's working
[2:03:22] even when I don't feel him he's working
[2:03:25] even when I don't hear him he's working
[2:03:29] he's always working he's always moving
[2:03:33] in the lives of Believers but every one
[2:03:36] of us have had
[2:03:38] a spiritual
[2:03:40] winter
[2:03:41] in our life where it appeared that the
[2:03:46] Lord was absent
[2:03:48] that he hath would that he had withdrawn
[2:03:51] himself
[2:03:53] listen to this
[2:03:55] because I interrupted the quote
[2:03:58] he said a spiritual winner is the is a
[2:04:02] time in which the Lord is seemingly
[2:04:06] absent and we feel little
[2:04:11] are no quickening
[2:04:14] presence
[2:04:16] let's look at that a moment
[2:04:19] it's a time in our life
[2:04:22] when it feels like
[2:04:25] that the Lord
[2:04:27] is absent
[2:04:30] and we feel little or no quickening
[2:04:34] presence
[2:04:37] I like the fact that he didn't say no
[2:04:40] he said a little or no
[2:04:43] because I like to say as the old song
[2:04:46] wrote The Flame has flickered but it's
[2:04:49] never gone out
[2:04:51] I'd like to say that in my life there's
[2:04:55] never been a time
[2:04:57] that I knew that the Lord that I that I
[2:05:00] thought or felt like the Lord had left
[2:05:02] me for good
[2:05:04] but there have been many times I felt
[2:05:07] like he'd gone on a vacation
[2:05:09] and had left me to try to try to figure
[2:05:12] things out on my own and don't you look
[2:05:15] at me critically because you know
[2:05:16] exactly what that feels like
[2:05:20] and then 1997 when I went through the
[2:05:23] darkest trial of my life both both of
[2:05:27] physically and mentally and emotionally
[2:05:29] spiritually
[2:05:30] it even in that moment when I felt like
[2:05:35] there was really no a presence or no
[2:05:39] quickening power in my life I would sit
[2:05:43] on the porch
[2:05:45] and rock in a rocking chair
[2:05:49] feeling totally alone
[2:05:53] and singing or humming the song
[2:05:57] feeling nothing until I would think of
[2:06:00] the words of this song and begin to rock
[2:06:02] and sing some through the water
[2:06:06] some through the flood
[2:06:08] some through the fire
[2:06:11] but all through the blood God leads us
[2:06:14] your children along and I would feel
[2:06:16] that flame flicker
[2:06:19] I'd feel it I'd feel life again
[2:06:22] and as soon as I would get out from
[2:06:24] under that I would be by myself again it
[2:06:26] seemingly felt like so I like the way
[2:06:29] that Wade wrote it in that moment when
[2:06:32] it's seemingly that it feels like the
[2:06:34] Lord is absent and we feel little or no
[2:06:37] quickening presence
[2:06:40] he goes on to say the primary purpose of
[2:06:44] a winter season
[2:06:46] is to cause us
[2:06:49] to seek something further
[2:06:54] ah
[2:06:56] rather than remaining content
[2:07:01] with our past spiritual accomplishments
[2:07:06] can I read it again
[2:07:08] the primary purpose of a winter season
[2:07:10] is to cause us to seek something further
[2:07:14] rather than remaining content with our
[2:07:17] past spiritual accomplishments
[2:07:20] during this time of winter we may not be
[2:07:24] aware that the Lord is patiently waiting
[2:07:28] without but actively looking
[2:07:33] Within
[2:07:36] does that speak to anybody's heart
[2:07:40] are you reminded of a Time
[2:07:44] thought that he had left you
[2:07:47] but he's really just standing around you
[2:07:50] without but he is actively looking
[2:07:53] Within
[2:07:56] to see where there may be room
[2:08:00] that he might expand himself
[2:08:05] in US
[2:08:07] in our lives
[2:08:09] this winter I'm through with the quote
[2:08:14] this winner
[2:08:15] represents the time of spiritual
[2:08:18] barrenness
[2:08:20] that the bride experienced
[2:08:23] while content with the blessings and
[2:08:26] satisfaction she had received by knowing
[2:08:29] about the bridegroom
[2:08:31] apart from having a personal
[2:08:33] relationship with him you can recognize
[2:08:37] that your bride and he's bridegroom but
[2:08:41] that does not give you the relationship
[2:08:44] between a bride and a bridegroom
[2:08:48] to develop a relationship with him as
[2:08:51] your bridegroom King you have to
[2:08:54] actively participate in the process of
[2:08:57] the spirit
[2:08:58] what the holy spirit is trying to do in
[2:09:02] our life is to bring us into an active
[2:09:06] engaged relationship with the bridegroom
[2:09:10] King
[2:09:12] and winter is not a defeated time winter
[2:09:16] is a time of preparation
[2:09:21] you've got to have in Bible environment
[2:09:24] you've got to have winter because you
[2:09:26] got to have the rain
[2:09:28] let me tell you something I've been in
[2:09:30] Israel in the winter and I've been in
[2:09:32] Israel when the first rain came sister
[2:09:35] Alfreda was with me one time and Kathy
[2:09:38] from California was with us one time in
[2:09:41] in Israel when a first winter rain came
[2:09:44] and it the ground is so dry from the
[2:09:48] summer
[2:09:50] that the first rain never soaks
[2:09:55] it rushes like a sheet of water
[2:09:58] it never penetrates the ground
[2:10:02] you can Google videos of whaties
[2:10:07] that that Rush where the winter rain and
[2:10:11] every year washes out highways
[2:10:15] and usually cars and sometimes people
[2:10:19] because they're driving around down by
[2:10:22] the Dead Sea
[2:10:24] and the rain falls on the Judean Hills
[2:10:27] and it literally goes off the mountain
[2:10:30] in sheets of water down into the wadis
[2:10:34] and it builds a tidal wave you can see
[2:10:37] it
[2:10:38] of water
[2:10:40] there will not be a trickle of water
[2:10:42] coming through that Wadi not a trickle
[2:10:44] until that tidal wave of water that's
[2:10:47] come from the Judean Hills makes its way
[2:10:50] down toward the lowland of the Dead Sea
[2:10:52] it's Gathering all the time and getting
[2:10:54] lower and lower and lower and people be
[2:10:56] driving they don't hear it
[2:10:59] they don't even realize it's coming
[2:11:01] until it comes
[2:11:02] and it washes out asphalt and Highway
[2:11:07] and cars and people if they're in the
[2:11:10] way and empties itself into the Dead Sea
[2:11:13] that's how the spring rains come
[2:11:17] and it has to rain and rain and rain and
[2:11:22] I can hear Cynthia Clawson singing the
[2:11:24] song it won't rain always
[2:11:28] the sun will shine again
[2:11:31] things will change
[2:11:33] whatever you're walking through now it
[2:11:36] didn't come to stay
[2:11:39] yeah
[2:11:40] anybody with me
[2:11:42] it came to pass but you got to get
[2:11:45] through it you can't bypass kindergarten
[2:11:50] you can't bypass Junior High you've got
[2:11:53] to go every step lined upon line and
[2:11:56] precept upon precept it takes the rain
[2:12:01] it takes the winter season
[2:12:06] the almond tree
[2:12:08] is the first to bloom
[2:12:11] but it's the absolute last to produce
[2:12:13] fruit
[2:12:16] blooms first
[2:12:18] but makes its fruit later
[2:12:20] than any of the other trees in the land
[2:12:23] of Israel and yet
[2:12:26] when you're there for any period of time
[2:12:29] and and the first almonds Bloom it
[2:12:33] becomes news
[2:12:36] front page Jerusalem Post
[2:12:40] I'm I'm being serious
[2:12:42] the almond trees are blooming
[2:12:45] people Rejoice they go out to eat
[2:12:49] they make a party
[2:12:52] and they celebrate because they know
[2:12:54] that winter has come to an end
[2:12:57] and the rains are beginning to dry up
[2:13:00] and and and fruit
[2:13:03] is about to appear again olives are
[2:13:05] coming
[2:13:06] pomegranates are coming and figs are
[2:13:09] coming and dates are coming and it's
[2:13:12] time because they're still a people who
[2:13:14] eat from the land and who live very much
[2:13:16] off the land and especially the Citrus
[2:13:18] that that never grew in Israel
[2:13:21] until Israel was re-established as a
[2:13:24] nation and now it's one of the largest
[2:13:26] Citrus producing nations in anywhere
[2:13:29] across the world per capita of people
[2:13:32] which is prophecy being fulfilled and in
[2:13:35] order for that to happen that way there
[2:13:37] had to be every season
[2:13:40] it takes every season of life and every
[2:13:45] season of weather to get us to where we
[2:13:48] can have more than a head knowledge I'm
[2:13:51] bribed he's bridegroom we've got to have
[2:13:54] more than a head knowledge we've got to
[2:13:56] have a heart knowledge we've got to have
[2:13:58] a heart revelation
[2:14:01] there is a fast car
[2:14:04] on The Fast Track and it's a revelation
[2:14:08] of Jesus Christ come on now
[2:14:12] so if you're looking for an ordinary
[2:14:14] Church you better keep looking
[2:14:18] because we have not been called of God
[2:14:20] to be just another church on a list of
[2:14:23] churches
[2:14:25] but we've been called to be a
[2:14:27] forerunning people
[2:14:29] we're not out there by ourselves we're
[2:14:31] following the right track we're
[2:14:33] following the fast car we're on Pace and
[2:14:37] we recognize that it's the revelation of
[2:14:40] Jesus Christ that's changing us
[2:14:43] from glory to glory from Faith to Faith
[2:14:46] and the winner represents a time of
[2:14:49] barrenness and aloneness but it's also a
[2:14:52] time of rain
[2:14:56] we've got to have daytime
[2:14:59] and we have to have night time
[2:15:02] there's a time for it to be dark outside
[2:15:05] there's a time for it to be bright and
[2:15:08] to be light
[2:15:10] now in all of that in the time I have
[2:15:14] left
[2:15:15] in laying all of that out for you
[2:15:19] and I'm worn out already
[2:15:22] I want to pick up on one word
[2:15:28] and in order to do that I have to read
[2:15:30] the sentence again
[2:15:33] Wade Taylor said a spiritual winter
[2:15:39] is a Time
[2:15:41] in which the Lord is seemingly absent
[2:15:46] and we feel little or no quickening
[2:15:51] presence
[2:15:55] I want to look at that word quickening
[2:16:01] in Greek
[2:16:04] it means to make alive
[2:16:07] it's a spark of life
[2:16:11] it's it's an exciting
[2:16:15] exhilarating
[2:16:17] Witness
[2:16:19] of spirit
[2:16:22] that God is God
[2:16:25] and no matter how dark the winner has
[2:16:27] been are you with me
[2:16:33] no matter how dark the winter has been
[2:16:36] God's got something new
[2:16:38] something good
[2:16:40] something fresh
[2:16:42] in a new season
[2:16:47] did you know that the new birth itself
[2:16:50] is a quickening experience
[2:16:53] how many of you have had a new birth let
[2:16:55] me see your hand
[2:16:57] I've had a new birth
[2:16:59] the new birth is not just a birth
[2:17:02] it is a quickening
[2:17:05] it is an auction of spirit
[2:17:08] that causes us to pass from death
[2:17:12] into life that's right brother
[2:17:15] I want you to look at Ephesians 2 1.
[2:17:18] and be Amplified
[2:17:20] and I want you to read this out loud
[2:17:22] with me when we get it
[2:17:24] I want you to read it out loud with me
[2:17:25] are you ready
[2:17:27] and you he made alive when you were dead
[2:17:34] slain by your trespasses and sins
[2:17:40] and you he made alive
[2:17:43] you you can't even be born again without
[2:17:46] a quickening in your spirit
[2:17:49] how we want that quickening how we need
[2:17:53] that quickening and you've got to
[2:17:55] understand it's not a Feeling
[2:17:58] it's not the product of an emotion it's
[2:18:00] a work of the spirit
[2:18:03] when the spirit finds US dead in our
[2:18:08] trespasses and sins and he shocks us
[2:18:14] he quickens us
[2:18:16] it's like paddles on the chest
[2:18:20] do you know what I mean
[2:18:22] your your heart is
[2:18:24] out of rhythm
[2:18:27] you're going
[2:18:29] your heart is trying to stop
[2:18:32] or it has stopped
[2:18:35] and they say clear
[2:18:38] and everybody takes their hands off you
[2:18:40] doctors and nurses
[2:18:42] take their hands off of you
[2:18:44] and they put those paddles on your chest
[2:18:50] and electricity
[2:18:54] electric waves run through those wires
[2:18:58] and out those paddles
[2:19:01] and it's so potent
[2:19:03] that it lifts the body right up off the
[2:19:06] bed
[2:19:08] it's a shock
[2:19:10] it is hopes
[2:19:13] of reconnecting the electrical circuits
[2:19:16] of the body
[2:19:17] to cause the heart
[2:19:19] to beat again
[2:19:22] we must have the quickening power
[2:19:30] amen
[2:19:33] we've got to have it
[2:19:36] to be transformed from death
[2:19:40] our trespasses our sins and made new by
[2:19:45] the Resurrection Life of Jesus Christ so
[2:19:48] the new birth is not just a birth
[2:19:53] it is a quickening
[2:19:56] as we pass from Death unto life now
[2:19:59] folks
[2:20:00] I want you to come with me now
[2:20:03] I want you to listen to me I want you to
[2:20:05] stop making your notes
[2:20:07] and I want you to use your faith I want
[2:20:10] you to use your gift and I want you to
[2:20:12] pull
[2:20:13] like you know how to do for just a few
[2:20:16] moments
[2:20:18] because God wants to do something for us
[2:20:21] before we leave here today
[2:20:24] and if we're not careful we'll get we'll
[2:20:27] miss it
[2:20:28] we'll miss it we'll get caught up in
[2:20:30] detail and we'll miss what the Lord
[2:20:32] wants to do
[2:20:34] so I want you to stay with me as much as
[2:20:37] you possibly can right now I want you to
[2:20:39] reduce the moving around
[2:20:42] and I want you to put as much focus on
[2:20:45] the remainder of this service as you
[2:20:48] possibly can
[2:20:50] because I want the Lord to hook you and
[2:20:52] I up
[2:20:58] I want more than just a light quickening
[2:21:03] if winter is over then I want more of a
[2:21:06] quickening in my life
[2:21:08] than I have had in a long long time
[2:21:11] and I want that for you and God is
[2:21:13] building some things
[2:21:15] he's building some things
[2:21:18] this
[2:21:21] even the worship this morning
[2:21:25] Josh moving out of his comfort zone and
[2:21:29] David playing out of his comfort zone
[2:21:31] and everybody pulling
[2:21:34] there was just a moment there when we
[2:21:37] weren't working so hard to stay in
[2:21:39] Rhythm and beat and we just forget about
[2:21:41] all the the technical parts of what
[2:21:44] we're doing and you just let out a
[2:21:47] praise it just kind of um
[2:21:51] and I'm just smiling boy if you saw me
[2:21:53] you go back and look see if you see me
[2:21:55] on there I was just smiling I was just
[2:21:57] grinning like a mule eating Briars
[2:22:00] because you all were doing that
[2:22:03] nobody nobody prompting you nobody
[2:22:06] pushing you you are just doing that
[2:22:10] because you were under the inspiration
[2:22:13] of the atmosphere
[2:22:15] you may not know it but it's in a moment
[2:22:17] like that that he's turning up the
[2:22:19] jewels
[2:22:22] he's increasing that quickening life
[2:22:25] that he wants to use to transform us
[2:22:29] First John 3 14 in the Amplified says we
[2:22:34] know
[2:22:36] that we have passed over out of death
[2:22:40] into Life by the fact that we love the
[2:22:44] brethren
[2:22:45] our fellow Christians
[2:22:48] he who does not love abides
[2:22:52] remains is held and kept continually in
[2:22:58] spiritual death
[2:23:05] it's not what we say
[2:23:12] it's how often we're willing to go to
[2:23:14] war
[2:23:15] on somebody's behalf
[2:23:18] that's real love
[2:23:21] when you're willing to fight for their
[2:23:22] freedom when you're willing to fight for
[2:23:24] their survival when you're willing to
[2:23:27] fight to see them move ahead in the
[2:23:29] things of God brother that is love
[2:23:33] you know prayer is not a cop-out when
[2:23:36] somebody says I'll pray for you and they
[2:23:38] actually do that it's the most valuable
[2:23:41] thing that anybody could ever do for our
[2:23:44] life is to pray for us
[2:23:47] there's power in that there's quickening
[2:23:50] life in that
[2:23:55] who does not love abides remains is held
[2:23:58] and kept continually in spiritual death
[2:24:02] I want you to look at Romans 6 for just
[2:24:04] a moment I'm just going to give you
[2:24:05] scriptures here for for a few few
[2:24:07] minutes
[2:24:10] Romans 6
[2:24:12] verse 3 through 5.
[2:24:15] are you ignorant of the fact
[2:24:19] that all of us who have been baptized
[2:24:22] into Christ Jesus were baptized read it
[2:24:28] you were baptized into his death
[2:24:33] we were buried therefore with him
[2:24:36] by the baptism into death
[2:24:39] so that just as Christ was raised from
[2:24:43] the dead by the glorious power
[2:24:46] quickening power of the father so we too
[2:24:51] might
[2:24:56] what is habitually
[2:24:58] to form a habit
[2:25:00] to form a habit
[2:25:02] so we too might form a habit to live and
[2:25:07] behave in what
[2:25:09] you can't do that in a spiritual winter
[2:25:16] but when winter comes to an end
[2:25:19] and God is calling you to a spring
[2:25:22] then what has only been a minor
[2:25:25] quickening in your spirit can now become
[2:25:28] so much more because spring is the
[2:25:32] message of Resurrection
[2:25:35] when you see the the the the flowers and
[2:25:40] the and the perennials that are dead
[2:25:42] that the winners kill them the cold has
[2:25:45] killed them the season has killed them
[2:25:46] and there's nothing left but a little
[2:25:49] pile of leaves there that have have just
[2:25:52] Fallen dead by the winter and all of a
[2:25:54] sudden you go out through the yard and
[2:25:56] you see those little shoots
[2:25:59] you take a hosta because they're so
[2:26:00] impressive
[2:26:03] and when they come they come
[2:26:06] you go out one day and it's about like
[2:26:08] that you go out the next day it's like
[2:26:09] that
[2:26:10] when they decide to burst forth they
[2:26:13] don't do it delicately they do it
[2:26:16] magnificently because spring is a
[2:26:19] message to all of us that there will be
[2:26:22] a winner and there will be death season
[2:26:24] and there will be dry season and there
[2:26:27] will be cold seasons in our life but
[2:26:30] spring is a testimony
[2:26:32] that Resurrection is coming and that new
[2:26:36] life is going to be on display this is
[2:26:40] why God's given us the seasons the way
[2:26:42] that he has
[2:26:44] in Romans 6
[2:26:46] he goes on to say
[2:26:49] the next verse verse 5 for if we have
[2:26:52] become one with him
[2:26:55] by sharing a death like his
[2:26:59] we shall also be one with him in sharing
[2:27:03] his
[2:27:05] Resurrection by a new life lived for God
[2:27:09] he's talking about quickening life
[2:27:12] quickening life okay
[2:27:15] next is that it
[2:27:20] for if we have become one with him
[2:27:24] by sharing a debt is that verse 5. oh
[2:27:27] that is the last one thank you so much
[2:27:30] now second Corinthians 5 17 let's go
[2:27:33] there just a minute
[2:27:35] therefore if any person this is
[2:27:38] Amplified again
[2:27:40] if any person
[2:27:42] is engrafted in Christ the Messiah
[2:27:46] he is a new creation
[2:27:50] a new creature all together the old
[2:27:55] previous moral spiritual condition has
[2:28:00] passed away behold the flesh the fresh
[2:28:05] the fresh and new has come what is he
[2:28:11] talking about he's talking about
[2:28:13] quickening life
[2:28:16] quickening power that jolts Us From A
[2:28:21] Long Winter
[2:28:22] into the New Hope of a springtime thanks
[2:28:27] be to God now let's go to First
[2:28:30] Corinthians 15 for just a moment
[2:28:34] verse 45 through 47.
[2:28:40] and so it is written
[2:28:45] the first man Adam
[2:28:48] was made
[2:28:50] a living soul
[2:28:52] tell me how that happened
[2:28:55] God made him first Out of the Dust of
[2:28:58] the ground
[2:29:01] and he lay there a dead shell
[2:29:05] of a being
[2:29:07] and then God himself came
[2:29:10] with his own
[2:29:12] ruach
[2:29:15] his own ruach his breath and he breathed
[2:29:20] breath into the nostrils of man
[2:29:25] and that dead
[2:29:27] shell of a being
[2:29:30] with the addition of the Breath of God
[2:29:35] Adam became
[2:29:38] a living
[2:29:41] soul mind
[2:29:43] will
[2:29:45] and emotions
[2:29:47] a few seconds before just a shell
[2:29:50] no thinking ability
[2:29:55] he couldn't get up and walk
[2:29:57] he had no life
[2:29:59] he was made only in the image of God
[2:30:02] formed of the Dust of the Earth but it
[2:30:04] took the breath so that's the quickening
[2:30:07] the quickening that we need is the
[2:30:10] Breath of God to be breathed in us again
[2:30:12] what is it that caused the frozen ones
[2:30:16] to fall out
[2:30:19] to begin to stretch themselves into what
[2:30:22] God was calling them to
[2:30:24] what was it it was the breath
[2:30:27] it was the quickening life
[2:30:30] how did man receive it by the breath
[2:30:33] but look at this he said so it is
[2:30:35] written the first man Adam was made a
[2:30:37] living Soul the last Adam was made a
[2:30:48] oddly enough that word in the
[2:30:52] in the Greek
[2:30:55] is a word the the the the uh what do you
[2:30:58] call it the root of that word is is
[2:31:03] Zoe Z I started to say Zed and I'm not
[2:31:07] Canadian
[2:31:08] z-o-o
[2:31:11] it's like
[2:31:13] Zoo
[2:31:18] the last Adam
[2:31:20] was made
[2:31:22] a quickening
[2:31:25] Spirit the first Adam was made a living
[2:31:28] soul
[2:31:30] the second Adam the last Adam was made
[2:31:33] of what
[2:31:35] a quickening spirit now here's the
[2:31:37] explanation how be it
[2:31:39] that was not first which is spiritual
[2:31:45] what God did for Adam
[2:31:49] was Supernatural
[2:31:51] but it was a natural process
[2:31:59] God breeds Supernatural breath into him
[2:32:03] to give him his natural ability
[2:32:07] to feel
[2:32:09] to think
[2:32:10] to show emotion
[2:32:12] it didn't do anything for his spirit
[2:32:16] it made him
[2:32:18] a soul
[2:32:25] that was life
[2:32:27] but it was natural
[2:32:30] he said how be it that was not first
[2:32:32] which is spiritual but that was just
[2:32:34] natural and afterward that which is
[2:32:37] spiritual
[2:32:39] now look at verse 47 the first man is
[2:32:42] what
[2:32:43] of the earth Adam
[2:32:46] the word Adam the name Adam is Adam in
[2:32:50] Hebrew and it means Earth of the Earth
[2:32:53] from the Earth
[2:32:55] Adam from the earth the first man is of
[2:32:58] the earth Adam earthy the second man is
[2:33:02] the Lord From Heaven
[2:33:04] oh
[2:33:08] so you're not just a human being living
[2:33:10] on a planet
[2:33:12] to fulfill an Earthly purpose
[2:33:15] there is a part of you that is eternal
[2:33:19] that is the Breath of God in you has
[2:33:22] made you a quickening spirit
[2:33:25] our Lord became a quickening spirit so
[2:33:28] that what was inside of him could be
[2:33:30] inside of us isn't that what Pentecost
[2:33:33] was about isn't that what Resurrection
[2:33:36] was about
[2:33:38] there have been no Resurrection
[2:33:40] there would have been no Pentecost
[2:33:43] had there not been quickening life and
[2:33:45] quickening power to raise up the dead
[2:33:48] body of the last Adam then there would
[2:33:51] have been no ability for the spirit that
[2:33:53] was in him to now live on you
[2:33:56] it was the life in the blood and the
[2:33:59] life of that blood that fell on the
[2:34:01] believer and that's what's happened to
[2:34:03] us so we have an Earthly part
[2:34:06] we have a soul that is alive with a mind
[2:34:09] and with a will and with an emotion but
[2:34:12] who we really are
[2:34:14] is a spirit that has been made alive
[2:34:17] because he has breathed his own
[2:34:20] Resurrection spirit
[2:34:22] his own quickening power has been
[2:34:25] breathed into us now wouldn't the enemy
[2:34:27] like to keep you locked in a winner
[2:34:31] Eternal winter I don't even know how
[2:34:33] many winners
[2:34:34] I don't know how long Narnia had been
[2:34:36] frozen over
[2:34:38] how many a hundred year a hundred
[2:34:41] Winters
[2:34:43] wouldn't the enemy just like to lock you
[2:34:47] in a season of a hundred Winters
[2:34:52] but all it takes
[2:34:54] is for the lion to move
[2:34:58] is this too much
[2:35:00] is it too wild is it too Sensational is
[2:35:04] it too mystical for you to get this
[2:35:06] morning
[2:35:07] oh I hope not
[2:35:09] now if I if I had strength and you had
[2:35:12] time
[2:35:13] I'd just go into another
[2:35:15] section of this I'll try to do it
[2:35:17] Tuesday night
[2:35:19] but let me just give you this little
[2:35:21] little part here
[2:35:22] you see Adam
[2:35:25] held something
[2:35:27] in his hand
[2:35:29] in original creation
[2:35:31] he held the title deed
[2:35:36] for full Redemption
[2:35:38] For All Mankind
[2:35:40] he held it in his hand it was a sealed
[2:35:43] book to Adam
[2:35:46] but there's a people
[2:35:49] that have not just been made a living
[2:35:51] soul
[2:35:52] they've also been made a quickening
[2:35:55] spirit like their lord
[2:35:57] and the same quickening power that makes
[2:35:59] a bride a quickening spirit the same
[2:36:03] power the same Resurrection Life that
[2:36:06] causes the bride to move by a quickening
[2:36:08] spirit has come
[2:36:11] to unseal the book
[2:36:14] to get it back where it belongs
[2:36:18] to reveal the Mysteries thereof
[2:36:21] so that you and I can understand the
[2:36:23] full Plan of Redemption it's a mystery
[2:36:25] the church will never understand
[2:36:27] I'm just being honest
[2:36:29] it wasn't for the church alone
[2:36:31] she may get bits and pieces of it but it
[2:36:34] was for a bride it was for a people that
[2:36:37] the bridegroom longed to have
[2:36:38] relationship with is anybody with me
[2:36:41] I understand that some of you have been
[2:36:43] listening again and going through some
[2:36:45] of the transvisions I commend you for
[2:36:47] doing that
[2:36:49] because that's just as much a part of
[2:36:51] your DNA as anything that's been spoken
[2:36:53] here today
[2:36:55] if God gave us those Visions as a body
[2:36:58] he did it because he wants us to walk in
[2:37:01] the power let me tell you something
[2:37:03] you're not going through anything right
[2:37:05] now
[2:37:07] that a visitation from The Headstone
[2:37:12] I can't change
[2:37:15] you just drop him in the river
[2:37:18] you just set the quickening life of that
[2:37:21] headstone dropped where you're near
[2:37:23] where you're standing
[2:37:25] and it'll bring Revival to your life so
[2:37:28] that you line up with the word so that
[2:37:30] he come and cap so that he comes and
[2:37:32] caps you
[2:37:34] into the fullness of the stature of the
[2:37:37] perfect man
[2:37:38] which is the Lord Jesus Christ now you
[2:37:41] see Adam had the title deed
[2:37:46] but he listened to his wife
[2:37:55] here it gets quiet
[2:37:57] he listened to his woman
[2:38:00] and she listened to the serpent
[2:38:03] and God had to rescue that book
[2:38:08] he had to take it away from Adam you
[2:38:10] know that's one of the if you ever dig
[2:38:12] and I I did
[2:38:14] and I'd love to preach that right now
[2:38:16] but I don't have the strength to do it
[2:38:17] now
[2:38:19] and you don't have the time to sit and
[2:38:20] listen to it right now
[2:38:22] but you ever go through those
[2:38:24] sections those quotes and dig into that
[2:38:27] a little bit it's the saddest thing
[2:38:30] it's so sad
[2:38:32] to think about Adam made in the image
[2:38:35] and the likeness of God he was an
[2:38:38] amateur God little G walking around in
[2:38:43] the earth he had power to move mountains
[2:38:47] to move trees to name animals he had
[2:38:50] Supernatural power in fact he was he had
[2:38:53] Dominion
[2:38:55] authority over the whole earth and he
[2:38:58] held it under his arm
[2:39:01] the title deed
[2:39:03] if the enemy would have showed up in the
[2:39:05] garden in any other form and tried to
[2:39:06] talk Adam out of that book he would have
[2:39:08] never been successful because Adam
[2:39:11] although he didn't understand what he
[2:39:13] had
[2:39:14] he was holding the authority which is
[2:39:17] the title deed for Redemption for the
[2:39:19] whole earth which is not just Souls on
[2:39:21] the earth it's actually for the Earth
[2:39:22] itself I want you to know the dirt
[2:39:25] beneath your feet has fallen and God has
[2:39:28] already made a plan to redeem even the
[2:39:31] dirt that you're walking on
[2:39:33] this Plan of Redemption is bigger than
[2:39:35] just the life of man it's everything
[2:39:38] that Satan has perverted and
[2:39:41] contaminated and polluted with his lie
[2:39:44] every bit of it restored back
[2:39:48] my my my my God's good to us
[2:39:51] but Adam forfeited that and you tell me
[2:39:54] can someone tell me what happened to the
[2:39:55] book then
[2:39:58] recently I heard someone preaching in
[2:40:01] the message
[2:40:02] who said Satan got the book
[2:40:05] you I tell you what if he got it we're
[2:40:07] lost
[2:40:09] I don't know where anybody got an idea
[2:40:11] like that they didn't get it from the
[2:40:13] message
[2:40:14] if Satan would have got a hold of that
[2:40:17] book
[2:40:18] he would have absolutely perverted every
[2:40:22] purpose that God had within that book no
[2:40:26] where did the book go anybody remember
[2:40:28] it went back to the hands of the
[2:40:31] original owner it went right back into
[2:40:33] God's hands where it belonged and God
[2:40:36] knew all along what Adam was going to do
[2:40:39] and he knew he'd get the book back and
[2:40:41] he knew he would watch over that book
[2:40:43] until he began to reveal it to Daniel
[2:40:49] then he places that seal book in the
[2:40:53] arms of John
[2:40:57] and John gets to stand back and watch
[2:41:00] the lamb
[2:41:02] who was really the lion
[2:41:04] who was really the lamp
[2:41:06] who was really the lion
[2:41:09] wasn't he
[2:41:10] oh a voice said gotta go
[2:41:16] let me give you one quotation Sixth Seal
[2:41:20] this one it's 137.
[2:41:24] watch this carefully he said compare
[2:41:26] scriptures of this great event that we
[2:41:30] will see that this great secret or
[2:41:32] mystery that was under the Sixth Seal of
[2:41:36] the book of redemption now remember
[2:41:38] these are hidden mysteries
[2:41:43] and the sixth excuse me and the six
[2:41:46] seals all together
[2:41:50] is one great big book
[2:41:54] now we know it wasn't a book
[2:41:56] codex wasn't invented it was a scroll
[2:41:58] and brother Branham said just six
[2:42:01] Scrolls rolled together
[2:42:05] interesting language here I have
[2:42:07] hundreds brother Greeley saw some of it
[2:42:10] one time I have hundreds of quotations
[2:42:13] about the six seals and the Seven Seals
[2:42:16] that I study at least once a week I read
[2:42:20] through them because there is so much
[2:42:22] that we have never been able to get a
[2:42:24] hold of and really fully grasp but this
[2:42:27] is in the middle of the seals this is
[2:42:29] the Sixth Seal he's been teaching us on
[2:42:31] the seals he's been revealing it under
[2:42:34] the inspiration of the Angel of the Lord
[2:42:35] that would come and stand in his den
[2:42:38] room every day and teach him
[2:42:40] but he was to come and bring to the
[2:42:42] people and this is on the Sixth Seal and
[2:42:46] he's still saying and the six seals all
[2:42:48] together one great big book just six
[2:42:50] Scrolls rolled together and it unwinds
[2:42:53] the whole book of redemption that's how
[2:42:56] the whole earth was redeemed listen at
[2:43:00] the next paragraph that's the reason
[2:43:02] John wept
[2:43:05] because if no one could get that book
[2:43:10] all creation everything was gone
[2:43:14] he would just simply turn back to atoms
[2:43:17] and molecules and so forth and Cosmic
[2:43:19] light and not even be creation person
[2:43:22] nothing else
[2:43:25] cause Adam lost the rights of that book
[2:43:29] he forfeited it when he listened to his
[2:43:33] wife and she listened to Satan's
[2:43:36] reasonings instead of the word of God
[2:43:39] see it was forfeited
[2:43:42] did you know
[2:43:44] s battle
[2:43:48] Italy's Eve's battle
[2:43:51] do you know where the greatest battle
[2:43:53] ever fought started it started in her
[2:43:58] it started in her mind
[2:44:02] same battle
[2:44:04] Chuck said when you get to the last
[2:44:07] battle
[2:44:09] interesting
[2:44:12] when you get to the last spell
[2:44:15] you'll see
[2:44:17] how it's supposed to look in here
[2:44:21] so interesting to me
[2:44:24] it's fascinating to me
[2:44:27] now I gotta move
[2:44:31] in fact I need to close
[2:44:34] now you know why it was 20 Pages it's
[2:44:36] three three sermons
[2:44:41] let me just just pull up one verse here
[2:44:43] first Corinthians 15 22.
[2:44:46] for as in Adam
[2:44:51] all die
[2:44:54] even so in Christ
[2:44:57] shall all be made alive
[2:45:02] Adam lost it Christ redeemed it
[2:45:09] do you see even that
[2:45:12] how many of you can see even that you
[2:45:14] have understanding of that
[2:45:16] what Redemption is for you
[2:45:18] you don't know what a blessing that is
[2:45:21] you don't know what a blessing that is
[2:45:22] churches are filled with with uh people
[2:45:25] today and Easter lilies on the altar
[2:45:28] in the Methodist Church they dye their
[2:45:31] eggs red so at least the children can
[2:45:33] see the blood of Jesus you know
[2:45:36] they've all got their traditions brother
[2:45:38] Branham talks about them putting their
[2:45:40] Easter lilies he says that's the spirit
[2:45:42] of Cain
[2:45:46] that's a pretty serious thing to say
[2:45:49] they bring their Easter lilies and they
[2:45:51] decorate the altar he said God doesn't
[2:45:53] want Easter lilies on the altar he wants
[2:45:56] you on the altar why don't you get that
[2:45:58] decoration off and put yourself up there
[2:46:00] that's what he's looking for so the
[2:46:02] churches are filled today and they go
[2:46:04] out I don't know what they'll do in the
[2:46:05] in the weather but they'll go out and
[2:46:07] they'll hide Easter eggs and the little
[2:46:09] children we'll go and pick up their
[2:46:11] Easter eggs and last night they they
[2:46:13] woke up mamas and daddies hid their
[2:46:15] baskets in their homes with all the
[2:46:18] little goodies in it and the kids woke
[2:46:19] up this morning and the children are
[2:46:21] told a lie that the Easter Bunny has
[2:46:24] hopped by in the night
[2:46:27] this is does this honestly think about
[2:46:29] what it sounds like
[2:46:31] when I was in Iceland and I read the
[2:46:34] stories of their uh uh uh I can't think
[2:46:36] of what it's called right now but uh the
[2:46:39] stories that they make up about about
[2:46:41] their Origins and their traditions and
[2:46:43] whatever you call it they've got the
[2:46:46] most hideous thing uh on Christmas they
[2:46:49] don't have a Santa Claus they've got a
[2:46:51] witch
[2:46:52] and the witch has children and they're
[2:46:54] the most hideous looking little imps
[2:46:56] you've ever seen in your life
[2:46:58] and the children put their put their
[2:47:01] shoes out and the witch comes by and
[2:47:03] puts gifts in their shoes and the little
[2:47:07] children how many of you think that just
[2:47:09] sounds uh outlandish let me see your
[2:47:12] hand
[2:47:13] doesn't that just sound just the
[2:47:14] weirdest thing you've ever heard in your
[2:47:16] life little children and they they make
[2:47:18] they make books and pictures and they
[2:47:20] show the witch looking in at the little
[2:47:21] children to see
[2:47:23] hideous looking creature looking in at
[2:47:25] the little children my goodness the
[2:47:27] little kids are afraid to go out they
[2:47:28] put the shoes out and lock the door
[2:47:31] they go to bed and hope they don't wake
[2:47:33] up in the night with a witch standing
[2:47:34] over their bed you know craziness
[2:47:37] well does that sound more Outland
[2:47:41] then a bunny hopping by
[2:47:46] one who lays eggs
[2:47:50] somebody don't know very much about how
[2:47:53] bunnies are born
[2:47:55] they don't hatch out of eggs
[2:47:58] so the whole world today and guess what
[2:48:01] they eat
[2:48:05] you know what they eat
[2:48:08] ham
[2:48:14] one day out of the year they make their
[2:48:17] ham dinner
[2:48:21] you ought to look at that
[2:48:23] that is as Pagan As It Gets
[2:48:28] they're they're taking they're taking
[2:48:30] revenge on the boar
[2:48:33] that killed was it nimrod
[2:48:39] it was one of the one of the figures in
[2:48:41] the story
[2:48:43] tamus
[2:48:45] killed by a wild boar that's right
[2:48:48] and so they everybody started eating
[2:48:51] traditionally ham
[2:48:55] to take revenge on the boar
[2:49:03] and that's so normal
[2:49:07] and you and I gathered here
[2:49:11] talking about
[2:49:13] Adam losing the title deed of redemption
[2:49:18] and God restoring that back
[2:49:22] into the hands of a bride
[2:49:26] who will minister in authority and Power
[2:49:30] in the last days to know that instead of
[2:49:34] thinking I have to eat ham today
[2:49:37] or instead of teaching my children or
[2:49:40] grandchildren that the bunny dropped off
[2:49:42] some presents for them in the night
[2:49:45] I have the grace of being able to pass
[2:49:48] down to my children that we have been
[2:49:52] restored
[2:49:54] all the way back to God's original
[2:49:56] thoughts about his people brother we
[2:49:59] don't know how blessed we really are we
[2:50:01] take this for granted can anybody just
[2:50:04] say Amen we take this for granted
[2:50:10] I'm closing
[2:50:12] musicians are coming
[2:50:16] what a hodgepodge
[2:50:21] I want to read just one because I I
[2:50:23] can't help but think about Resurrection
[2:50:27] can help but think about him
[2:50:30] First Corinthians 15 17 says if Christ
[2:50:32] be not raised your faith is vain ye are
[2:50:36] yet in your sins
[2:50:38] did you know that the apostles said that
[2:50:41] the death in itself was not enough to
[2:50:45] reveal to you who you are you had to
[2:50:48] have more than a revelation of the death
[2:50:50] you also had to have an impartation of
[2:50:53] his resurrection live or you can't
[2:50:55] understand the new birth
[2:50:57] because the death is not what gives you
[2:51:00] quickening power it's the resurrection
[2:51:04] it's the resurrection
[2:51:08] how do we know that because the Bible
[2:51:10] tells us
[2:51:13] the scripture tells us
[2:51:16] in Romans chapter 8 verse 11 but if the
[2:51:19] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[2:51:22] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[2:51:25] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[2:51:28] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[2:51:32] dwelleth in you
[2:51:34] you've got quickening power you've got
[2:51:36] quickening life in here isn't that
[2:51:39] wonderful to know
[2:51:47] to give you this last
[2:51:57] it's in the message I'm sorry for
[2:51:59] jumping around that's not the name of
[2:52:01] the message
[2:52:02] but I'm sorry for jumping around it's in
[2:52:04] the message and thy seed shall possess
[2:52:06] the Gate of his enemies
[2:52:08] Long Beach California
[2:52:11] let's read this then when he died down
[2:52:14] at the cross
[2:52:16] hell taken his precious soul
[2:52:21] the Bible said his soul descended into
[2:52:26] hell
[2:52:28] that's exactly right hell captured his
[2:52:32] soul and took him down there how many of
[2:52:35] you think that probably wasn't a real
[2:52:37] good move
[2:52:41] because while he was down there he did
[2:52:43] business
[2:52:45] Hallelujah
[2:52:46] [Music]
[2:52:48] the prophet said but brother on that
[2:52:51] third day he possessed the gates of
[2:52:57] death hell and Grave and Rose up the
[2:53:03] third day and look at the next phrase
[2:53:05] and
[2:53:11] overcome it all
[2:53:13] what
[2:53:15] he took sickness
[2:53:20] the grave and everything
[2:53:25] I believe he jerked the gate Plumb off
[2:53:28] the hinges of them
[2:53:30] and took them Out rose on
[2:53:36] how scripture said he ascended on high
[2:53:39] and did what
[2:53:40] he gave gifts unto men
[2:53:45] that's the Ascension gifts the gifts
[2:53:49] that could only come down if he went up
[2:53:53] and what were those gifts that could
[2:53:55] only come down if he went up not tongues
[2:53:57] interpretation tongues prophecy
[2:53:59] Ascension gifts Apostle Prophet Pastor
[2:54:03] teacher and evangelist got to have them
[2:54:08] he said I believe he jerked the gate
[2:54:10] Plumb off the hinges of them and took
[2:54:11] them out rose on high ascended on high
[2:54:13] and tonight
[2:54:16] you are more Hallelujah
[2:54:20] you are more than conquerors his seed
[2:54:25] shall possess
[2:54:31] the gates of the enemy
[2:54:34] yes sir
[2:54:37] he possessed every game he conquered
[2:54:41] every sickness he conquered every sin he
[2:54:45] conquered every Temptation he conquered
[2:54:48] death he conquered hell he conquered the
[2:54:52] grave he possessed the Gate of all of
[2:54:54] them
[2:54:55] listen
[2:54:56] and we in him
[2:55:01] are more than conquerors Hallelujah
[2:55:04] cause he conquered for us oh we would
[2:55:10] never know what the true Seed of Abraham
[2:55:12] was
[2:55:17] praise
[2:55:19] come on let's Praise Him
[2:55:21] Hallelujah

[2:57:41] I've stepped into another world
[2:57:46] Aslan is a lion

[2:58:07] safe of course he isn't safe
[2:58:11] but he's good

[2:58:30] serve
[2:58:31] Hallelujah he wasn't safe
