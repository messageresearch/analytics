All over the building, there are hands that are raised. If you have a spok a need that you would like us to say across the pullpit during this meeting, just make sure that perhaps we get it on a piece of paper or through a text. We'd be glad to uh speak that need out loud. There are lots of needs, but there's one thing that I know about my Lord. He knows it before I even ask. And and we as humans, we like to know all the little nitty-gritty details because we're a nosy bunch. &gt;&gt; But my Lord, he already knows the details. And besides knowing the details, he knows how to fix the problem. &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful that I can take it to my papa and he can handle the situation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Would you sing this little course sweep over my soul? I'm going to ask brother Hawk to come and pray tonight over these requests. Sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul. Sweet spirit, sweep over my soul. My rest is complete while I sit at your feet. Sweet spirit, sweep over my soul. Sing once again. Oh, sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul. Sweet spirit, sweep over my soul. [Music] My rest is complete while I sit at your feet. Sweet spirit &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, I have found &gt;&gt; my favorite place &gt;&gt; in my whole life is to be at your feet. &gt;&gt; It's to sense you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's to feel you. is to recognize your voice within me. Recognize your love towards me. All of us here, we are striving for rest, fighting for rest. But Lord, we want you to find your rest &gt;&gt; in us. That's the word. &gt;&gt; That is your desire. Lord, would you help us to know it &gt;&gt; with a heart knowledge that you want to inhabit your bride? You want to make love with her by your spirit. We were created for you and for your pleasure. It's only in you where we have true satisfaction, true deliverance, true meaning, and true purpose. What a privilege to be redeemed by you, oh king. &gt;&gt; Lord, it's your desire that we would be free. &gt;&gt; That is the reason you came. You wanted to prove to us where we that we would be worth it that you would lay down your own life. Lord, help us to really see what you have already done. You've already done it. May every lie of the enemy be broken in the authority of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. We silence it right now in the name of Jesus. May truth prevail. &gt;&gt; Have your way, oh God. Give us the grace to surrender and to say yes. &gt;&gt; We're not asking you just to take the troubles away. We're asking you for the grace and the overcoming anointing &gt;&gt; to win, to overcome for the glory of God. May healing manifest in everybody that needs healing right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we just say have your way in this service. Use our brothers for the glory of God. May they yield to the anointing and may your word come forth with power and authority and accomplish what it needs to accomplish in the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. Before you move, I I want to I don't want to miss this opportunity to say that while we were worshiping the Lord, I began to sense and see that there are old gnarly uh maybe that's not a good word. Uh roots, but but gnarled. Sorry, I I think I said something kind of but but gnarled root old roots. If you have been in the garden of Gethsemane, you would see those olive trees where they have carbonated limbs that have fallen off to be over 2,000 years old. And you can just imagine after being trimmed and trimmed and trimmed and trimmed how how twisted and u you would almost think ugly, but they're not. They're actually very beautiful because out of those old twisted stumps and what's left of a tree right out of the top will be these beautiful olive branches with with beautiful olives right across from Gethsemane. And I saw tonight that some of us have some roots that are so gnarled and so old and so deep that we have become used to our bondage. We we've just become comfortable and we don't even know we're bound because we've been stagnant so long and we have been static so long. But but the Lord, I believe, I know for sure he's more than able &gt;&gt; to lay the root right, the axe right to the root of whatever holds you &gt;&gt; and whatever you keep running back to a and in doing so, you don't even realize really your condition. I don't know if you can relate to that or not, but there are times like the prodigal son, we don't recognize our condition &gt;&gt; until we do &gt;&gt; and our eyes pop open and we say, "Why in the world would I spend another night eating slop &gt;&gt; when my father has more than enough on his table?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The prophet preached to us total deliverance. &gt;&gt; And it's been watered down and watered down and watered down in this hour until people are being taught to just accept these kinds of things in their life and just keep loving the Lord and hearing the word and going to church and everything's going to be all right. But that's beautiful. It's even attractive, but it's not what he preached. &gt;&gt; He preached that there was total deliverance available &gt;&gt; that goes right to the root, &gt;&gt; the root of the root &gt;&gt; and begins to grub it out. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said we needed a grubbing hole. &gt;&gt; Go right to the root. Can I just pray? It's not my turn, but can I just pray for you right now? Uh would you would you ask the Lord if if you've got I ask him before I before I interrupted I ask him to show me the places where I may be tethered to this earth. &gt;&gt; I was not born to be a a buzzard you know or a chicken. I was born to fly &gt;&gt; and to soar and so are you. and and may God help us to identify uh old bondages, hurts and wounds. Uh those who wounded us are dead. They're gone. They're not coming back except perhaps in a resurrection. A and yet we are still being affected by those old old things. Uh does it make sense to anybody? I'm having a hard time getting it together, but let me pray. And and if you feel like there's any possibility that there's something old and ugly, gnarled, some root that holds you back that causes you to remain bound and you know the word has come to set you free. &gt;&gt; And you don't want partial deliverance. And you don't want just a little bit of freedom. You don't want just freedom to have emotion or or a chill bump or you you want freedom to live a Christ life. &gt;&gt; Father, in the name of Jesus, I didn't want to say anything, but Lord, I believe there's somebody here tonight that will hear this because you don't waste your time with us. You whatever you do, you do for purposes and kingdom advancements. And tonight I ask you, Lord, to turn the search light of your love into the deepest recesses of who we are and show us by your word, by your spirit, by your grace, anything that has not been addressed, anything that we have not properly dealt with by the word and it's affecting us years later, we live under the influence of something so old that it's uh it's just history. Father, I ask tonight that somebody's faith would rise and they would say, "I I I don't want this place anymore. I don't want it in me. I don't want to be tethered to the earth. I don't want to have old roots growing in my life. I want to have forgiveness in my heart. Whether they've asked for it or not, whether they deserve it or not, I want to forgive because you did. Because you said, "Father, forgive them. They don't even know what they're under. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THE SPIRIT THAT THEY CARRY. But Lord, I ask right now that you would help us. That you would help us to let it go, to turn it loose. We want to hear your word tonight. Free enough that it would settle down into us and do for us what we cannot do for ourselves. &gt;&gt; Precious Lord, would you just reach your hand to him just another moment? We're not trying to force anything. I just want it off of me so I can enjoy the rest of this service. Lord, we just put our antenna right up and we say none of us are immune. None of us live above having those kinds of things that haunt us, that haunt us. And so Lord, tonight your word has promised us a total deliverance. &gt;&gt; And we want freedom in every area. Lord, if there's anybody in our life that has harmed us and we have not been able to forgive and let it go, would you give us victory as the word comes forth tonight? Oh yes, &gt;&gt; it would be a paradigm shift to us. It would be a total change. &gt;&gt; My goodness, you'd find you feel better physically. &gt;&gt; You you'd find that letting go of those things and having them dealt with by the word at the root. You'd find a freedom and a and a a change of heart and a better attitude. Lord, this is what we want. We don't want to walk around among the bride like we're mad at the whole wide world. Grumpy and and and sour. I'm so tired of sourness. The reality is we've all been through so much stuff. But we can choose this evening to let you do the business. And I start right here, Lord. Start right with me. Start right here, Lord, and go to the root of anything. Show me what it is and I'll get it out. I I'll do my part. I'll participate with you. Lord, let it move over this place. May we prepare our hearts to let it go to be free from it in the precious name. Sorry, brother. The precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, I thank you. I thank you that you created me to be whole, &gt;&gt; healthy &gt;&gt; in the spirit. We bless you and thank you for it, Lord. Hallelujah. Will you give him a great hand clap of praise? One that he's worthy of tonight. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're worthy, Lord. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He paid a debt. He did not owe ow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sing this course before you're seated tonight. He paid a debt. He did not owe. I owed a debt. I did not pay. I needed someone to wash my sin away. And now I sing a brand new song. Amazing grace all day long. Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay. Once again, he paid a debt he did not owe. I owed a debt I could not pay. I needed someone to wash my sin away. And now I sing a brand new song. Amazing grace. All day long. Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay. [Music] Aren't you thankful that he paid that debt for you? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praises to our God. &gt;&gt; You may have your seats tonight.

Brother John, how many years have you been promising me you were coming? &gt;&gt; He says 25. I don't remember. Why don't you come and get ready to sing while I finish uh naming names here? Come on.

But Isaac Yovic is in the service tonight and we are so happy. Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Did I get everybody?

You got one. All right. &gt;&gt; This This is a little intimidating after singers like Brother Dwayne here and Brother Shelly and Brother Benjamin. I tell you, it's uh if I seem nervous, you got a revelation real quick. But I have been promising, brother Steve I was going to get down here for a long time. And I have tried, but I kept trying till I made it. Amen. So now now it's probably going to become a habit. But Amen. [Music] You forgive me, but I always say this when I go someplace new and I meet uh a portion of the bride. But I I ran a luxury limousine service for 25 years. And I met a tremendous amount of very very famous people that if I called their names, everybody would know them. Politicians, entertainers, sinners, and whatever. And then one the question that everybody would ask me, who is the most famous person that you've ever had in your limousine? And I would come up with some name like Terry Tedwell or some member of the bride and they'd say, "Who in the world is that?" I said, "You don't know that person. That is royalty. &gt;&gt; You should definitely know that person." And I'm reminded, brother Dan Daisy said one time him and Brother Green were standing outside of Buckingham Palace and he looked at Brother Green and he said, "Brother Henry," he said, "we've been standing here for 15 minutes and the queen has not invited me in for tea yet." He said, "Early royalty standing up there looking down here at heavenly royalty. You really ought to give yourself a hand because you are that elite lady, that that royalty today. Amen. &gt;&gt; You forgive me. These these musicians can cover up my singing and it'll be well good. But I love this song because I'm just I'm just biting my time until he says come up higher. And I'm just waiting for that moment. Amen. When all gravitation will lose its hold. Amen. And we're going to go to meet him in the air. Any anybody can identify with that today? Amen. Be be flat, brother. My heart can sing when I pause to remember. A heartache here is but a step in stone along the trail. that wind always upward. This trouble world is not my final home. But until then, my heart will go on singing. And until then with joy I'll carry on until the day my eyes behold that city until the day God calls me [Music] The things of earth will dim and lose their value. If we recall, they're only borrowed for a while. and the things of earth that caused my heart to tremble. [Music] Remember there they will only bring a smile. God until then my heart will go on singing and until then we jo [Applause] [Music] the day my eyes [Music] until the day God calls me home. But until then, my heart will go on singing. until the end with joy. I'm going to carry on until that day. my eyes. Behold that city until the day God calls me home. Amen. Singary. This weery world with all its toil and struggle. Listen may take its toll of misery and strife. But the soul of man is like a waiting eagle when it's really oh it's destined for the sky sing oh until then my heart will Go on singing and until the end with joy. I'm going to carry on until the day my eyes behold that city until the day God calls me home. I'm going to do that again. This weery world with all its toil and sorrow may take its toll of misery and stri. Listen, church. The soul of man. Oh, is like a wait. I'm waiting. I'm waiting. When it's released. Oh, but until the end. My heart will go on singing and until the end with joy I'll carry on until that day my eyes oh that city glory Glory until the day God calls us home. [Music] Amen. It's just right. Just right. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Ain't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; You can be seated. Oh, that's just right. How many of you know it won't be long now? &gt;&gt; Your eyes are going to see the city. &gt;&gt; My my my brother brother John and and uh his wife and family. Thank you all for being here tonight. Um, I stood out on the parking lot in Ruth, North Carolina 30 plus years ago and talked to brother John and brother Robby Turner. And uh, they encouraged me. They they somehow knew what a hard road lay ahead for me. I don't know how they knew, but I could tell by the way they talked to me. They knew that my road was about to get hard. And I have never forgotten the encouragement that they both gave me. It had to be 30 years ago. And I more. It has to be. Oh, it's been I pas I've pastored here 35 years. So, it's about 40 years. Oh, it's a wonder me and you can get up here. Brother John had dear friends that are that were and will be again when I see him again. Dear friends of mine, Brother Henry Green, Brother Dan Dasley that he mentioned, and Brother Gerald Cleveland. He loved you all so very much. And I'm very thankful for brother Cleveland and his testimony in my life and the the courage that he had to introduce me to something that was much bigger than I realized at the time. Isn't God faithful? &gt;&gt; Well, we got to hurry. Although we're having I'm having a really really good time. &gt;&gt; I was going to say blast, but since I've already said a strange word while ago, I I won't say it. But uh I feel like that's what it is. would you uh would you consider uh sewing something into this meeting? We want the the ministers who will be speaking to be blessed and maybe some of their expenses defraed. And we also recognize that it's cost you to get here. And I just pray that the Lord will bless you back abundantly again and again and again for your giving. We have a double header tonight. I know they're going to be sensitive to the spirit. Brother Joe Ryder is going to come and spend some time with us sharing. I said, you know, we were expecting brother Caleb Duron from Tucson to be here. He was flying in today just just before midnight last night. He said, "Are you available for a call?" Normally, that would not be the case, but I happened to be still sitting at the table at the time. and uh he had something come up that was of a serious nature and and uh we just released him very quickly because I've been there. I've been there and and I don't want anyone to be away from what what they need to attend to. You understand? So, he was going to share the evening with brother with brother Ryder this evening, but instead brother Dwayne will. Well, you say it might must be going to take all night. Well, let's see if it does. Uh, we've come here, we come once a year for this and we want the Lord to have his way. &gt;&gt; I mean that. &gt;&gt; I mean that. If you don't mean it, you just can slip out when you need to. We will just be glad to see you the next time you're here. Maybe tomorrow night. We better go ahead and warn you that we won't be in a hurry then either. &gt;&gt; Uh, we don't know how much time we have left here. I want to use every bit of it to the glory of God. Don't you? &gt;&gt; I'm not going to ask you to stand because you've been standing so long, but uh Brother Ellas, how about you coming and um Brother uh Ian, you can come, too. But stand up here, would you, with the bags and and it'll be quicker. It can be quicker this way. If you have an offering or if you're local and you have tithe you want to put in tonight, you can certainly do that. Uh last night was our regular weekly church service. If you don't want to come, well, we have dozens of children who love to come. So, just hand it to one of them as they pass by. Father, we thank you tonight for that our hearts have already been blessed. We have this strong in inspiration that much more is to come. We ask tonight that you would bless our efforts to sew back into the work. We pray that you'll multiply it to the giver. Lord, I I want your people to be blessed for their faithfulness to you. And that's who you are. That's who you are. You have given back abundantly to your people, pressed down, shaken together, and running over. And bless these brothers for standing up here tonight to receive it. In the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. The saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Just a little bit of some choruses. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. Something. Let's play something with a little pep to it. Uh so they can uh they'll want to get up. This is your time to stretch your legs. It's glory, glory, hallelujah. Since I laid my burden down, glory, glory, hallelujah. Since I laid my burden down. voice. Hallelujah. Since I lay my burden down. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. Since I laid my burden down. Well, I'm feeling just like shouting. Hallelujah. Since I lay my burden down. Lord, I'm feeling just like shouting since I laid my burden down. Glory. [Music] Since I laid my burden, you remember. Glory, glory, hallelujah. Since I laid my burden now. Well, I'm feeling so much better. Since I lay my heavy burden now, now I'm feeling a whole lot better. Since I laid my burden down, I laid them down. Lord, I laid them down at a Holy Ghost altar. I laid them down. I laid them down, Lord. I laid them down at a Holy Ghost altar. I laid them down. I'm crying holy, holy unto the Lord. I'm crying holy, holy unto the Lord. Well, now if I could, I surely would stand on that rock where Moses stood. I'm crying holy, holy unto the Lord. Crying holy, holy unto the Lord. Well, now if I could, I surely would stand on that rock where Moses stood. Well, I'm saved and I know that I am. I'm saved and I know that I am. I'm saved and I know that I am. I'm so glad. I know that I am. I'm sanctified and I know that I am sanctified and I know that I am sanctified. And I know that I am. I'm so glad. I know that I am Holy Ghost fil. And I know Holy Ghost fil. And I know that I am Holy Ghost fil. And I know that I am. I'm so glad. I know that I am. Oh, I'm running trying to make a 100. 99 and a half. Won't do. Oh, I'm running. Got to make a 100. 99 and a half. You got to go all the way. It just won't do. Lord, just won't do. 99 and a half will never do. It just won't do. Just won't do. 99 and a half. Just won't do. Run all the way. Run all the way. Don't dare slow down now. &gt;&gt; Well, it's only shorter to hold the bags if you only sing as long as they hold the bags. But if you sing another 10 minutes, it's longer. Mathematics, that wasn't my strong point in school. Uh, would you stand again? Brother Joe Ryder has been a I can't quite I can't I've never quite been able I have really big teeth and I have a hard time rolling the R writer writers but he's been a longtime friend with his family from South Africa and uh they wanted to be here this year and we're glad that they're here and I ask him to take a portion of the service. He said, "I just have a word from the Lord and I just want to deliver that and that's all I have." Well, do you know that's all I want to hear. &gt;&gt; That's what we heard last night. &gt;&gt; It may not have come in the style of prophecy, but it was prophetic &gt;&gt; from the first word &gt;&gt; to the last word. And when brother Greley turned around and looked and said, "I didn't know it was 10 o'clock." I knew by the look on his face that he really meant it. &gt;&gt; I'm glad he didn't. &gt;&gt; I'm glad he didn't know what time it was &gt;&gt; because we would have missed the tail end of it. &gt;&gt; And I've got a feeling that he could have he could have rung the rag a little tighter tonight and give us some more. But what he needs to understand is it kept preaching to us. &gt;&gt; It preached to me all night. Every time I woke up, I could see those brothers lifting those stones up that he had here with a illustrated sermon and carrying them around. &gt;&gt; And I love the fact that we can all have our gifts, our our uniquenesses in delivery and still be used of God for his his little bride. His bride, everybody in his bride's not just the same. &gt;&gt; And they receive things differently. And children learn, I'm a child. Children learn at different levels and with different methods. &gt;&gt; So God has just what you need if you're open for it. Father, would you use our brother &gt;&gt; as he comes and delivers whatever it is that you've placed on his heart for us. May there be somebody I will. &gt;&gt; But Lord, let there be somebody else in here that'll join me and have a open heart full of faith to receive whatever it is that you have spoken to. our brother on our behalf and we'll give you the glory and the praise in the most lovely name of Jesus Christ. The saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Beloveds be greeted in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I am indeed very thankful to be here. This is one of the trips that I felt I need to make whether I have funds or whether I do not have funds. I don't have a sermon here for you tonight, but I firmly believe it is a prophetic time that we live in. &gt;&gt; It's a time that we need to acknowledge this the hour and the season that we are in. &gt;&gt; Hold it up. But I want you to as you stand this night, I actually want to get into it, I want you to turn to the book of Revelation, &gt;&gt; chapter 18. And there's many great sermons around this chapter. But I want to speak tonight. I want to deliver a message tonight around this chapter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 18 verse one. And after these things, I saw another another angel come down from heaven, having great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Verse two. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, &gt;&gt; saying, Babylon the great is fallen. And he repeats it. He's fallen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; And he's become the habitation of devils. &gt;&gt; And the hold of every foul spirit &gt;&gt; and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. Verse three says, "For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the earth and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. and the merchants of the earth are wax rich through the abundance of her delicacies. &gt;&gt; Verse four says, &gt;&gt; "And I heard another voice &gt;&gt; from heaven saying, come out of her, &gt;&gt; my people." &gt;&gt; Yes. And here is the warning. That you may not and that ye be not partakers of her sins. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And that ye receive &gt;&gt; not &gt;&gt; of her plagues. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless &gt;&gt; the reading &gt;&gt; of his word. Let's bow our heads. &gt;&gt; God, I pray tonight. &gt;&gt; Precious Lord. &gt;&gt; I pray God that you will just meet us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; I pray God, let me just speak the way you've summons me to speak. Lord, &gt;&gt; hide me in your word, Lord. Clothe me with your word. And Lord, let us receive &gt;&gt; the word in in the manner in which you have given it. God bless the reading of his word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. There's a voice that calls his bride &gt;&gt; to come out of her. heard it. &gt;&gt; There's a voice and there is many voices in this hour. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That we hear. &gt;&gt; We are in a season of many voices. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; We're in a season where the voices are conflicting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We live in a season of a lot of fake messages. &gt;&gt; James 2 verse 19 says THE DEVIL ALSO believe &gt;&gt; and treble tremble. &gt;&gt; I want to SAY TO YOU THE DEVIL ALSO HAS A QUOTE WE LIVE IN A SEASON WHERE MANY'S GOT A QUOTE. &gt;&gt; MANY HAS EMBRACED A QUOTE. &gt;&gt; The devil also has a quote &gt;&gt; and he knows the scriptures. But you see over the years I want to help the young people this morning this evening &gt;&gt; amidst all these voices. How do we discern &gt;&gt; the true voice of God? A lesson TAUGHT TO ME WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG. How do I discern what God is saying? &gt;&gt; We are challenged. THE ONE SAYS I'M FROM PETER. THE OTHER ONE SAYS I AM FROM PAUL. Who is right? &gt;&gt; Peter or Paul, &gt;&gt; same message, &gt;&gt; same season, &gt;&gt; but we still feel conflicted. &gt;&gt; How do I discern? &gt;&gt; What is God saying to me? Amen. &gt;&gt; We live in a season where people run after every voice. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; WE LIVE IN A SEASON WHERE EVERYBODY SAYS LIKE THE PRO LIKE I THINK IT'S ISAIAH SAYS HE SAYS IN THAT DAY ONE WOMAN will will get HOLD OF SEVEN MEN AND SAYS JUST give me your name. backwards. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Seven women just backwards. Absolutely. But how do we discern &gt;&gt; what is God saying? &gt;&gt; We got to we GOT TO BE ABLE TO HELP THIS GENERATION. We got to help. It's going to become more difficult &gt;&gt; because the truth has been twisted in the season. &gt;&gt; WE LIVE IN A SEASON WHERE SOMEBODY JUST FIND ONE LINE OF A QUOTE AND HE RUNS with that quote. AND NOT FINDING THE CONTEXT of that quote &gt;&gt; 100% pastor &gt;&gt; the highest order is the is the absolute which is the word of the lord &gt;&gt; gideon IN JUDGES 6 VERSE 37 This man he got TO TEST. THE BIBLE SAYS, "BEHOLD, I WILL PUT OUT I'LL PUT A FLEECE OF WOOL in the floor. &gt;&gt; And if the dew be on the fleece only, &gt;&gt; and it be dry upon all upon all the earth beside, then shall I know." &gt;&gt; You got to put out the fleas. YOU CANNOT RUN AFTER EVERY QUOTE, after every word that you hear. &gt;&gt; But St. Paul comes in 2 Corinthians chapter 13 and he says, "In the mouth of two or three witnesses &gt;&gt; shall every word be established." &gt;&gt; You got to test it. JOHN WENT ON IN IN 1 JOHN 4:1, HE SAID, "BELOVED, BELIEVE NOT EVERY SPIRIT, BUT TRY THE SPIRITS &gt;&gt; WHETHER they are of God, &gt;&gt; because many false prophets are gone out into the world." Yes sir. &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians Thessalonians verse 5 chapter 5 verse 21 says prove &gt;&gt; all things. &gt;&gt; We got to be able to test &gt;&gt; the word. &gt;&gt; This brings me TO THE MESSAGE WHAT I want to share with you this this day. Now it comes against John Job 33:15 and 17. If somebody in here doubts how God speaks to us, Job 33:15, in a dream, &gt;&gt; in a vision of the night, when deep sleep fallth upon men, &gt;&gt; in slumberings upon the bed, Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; THEN HE OPENED THE EYES of men and sealth their instruction that he may withdraw from his purpose and hide from man. Few months ago, God gave me a dream and it's against this background and I want to share this dream with you. It was about a dead a dead woman. The dream evolves revolves around a woman's passing. I found myself in a room where I witnessed a death. However, the issue wasn't a demise itself, but rather the men that had oversight over this body handling of the situation. They went to great lengths to conceal her death, FEARING THAT OTHERS who discover the truth. I WATCH IN DISMAY AS THEY ATTEMPTED to distort reality, APPLYING MAKEUP &gt;&gt; and painting A FACE IN A FUTILE EFFORT to make her appear alive. When this APPROACH FAILED, THEY RESORTED TO ALL FURTHER desperate measures to present her as if she were still alive. What saddened me the most in this dream and I was so emotional when I saw this was that these men were aware that the reviving of this body was impossible. Yet they persisted in their futile endeavors. Beloveds, it's dead. It is dead. AND I WANT TO BRING YOU BACK. In 1962, A SERMON BY OUR PROPHET CAME OUT. WHY I'M AGAINST organized religion. [Music] &gt;&gt; I wasn't born YET AT THAT TIME. SOME OF YOU MAY BE ALIVE WHEN YOU HEARD WHEN HE PREACHED THIS message and he challenged every historian and he said I want to ask any historian here present now or on it on its or it's on tapes come to come show me at any time that men organize a church. &gt;&gt; HE DIED RIGHT THERE AND NEVER did rise again. &gt;&gt; Beloveds, I I want you to be able to understand the very same thing. Think about it. through his sermons, HE WENT AT LENGTHS OF HOW WE'VE BEEN RIDICULED, how we've been ridiculed, HOW WE'VE BEEN THROWN OUT of churches because of the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; But how have we become so organized? &gt;&gt; HOW HAVE WE BECOME SO LABEL FOCUSED? How have we become so protected? &gt;&gt; The danger is coming. Benjamin, the danger is coming. Revelation 18 speaks about this. I want to be able to in that same sermon, I want to to be able to to to draw you to the attention Yes, &gt;&gt; just look at this quote. And he turns to the brand tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Now I want to ask you something and he became he he become more closer home. He's not talking to the Pentecostals out there. He's not talking to the Presbyterians out there. &gt;&gt; He's not talking to the meth Methodist. &gt;&gt; He comes closer. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you something. You're fixing to grow into a big tabernacle now. I may be away for a while. I may go somewhere. Hard to tell where the Lord will call me. maybe of the scene, maybe back into the field, maybe he might call me into the wilderness. I don't know where he will call me till Jesus comes. I want to ask you something. Did I ever ask you for anything? And the congregation says no. Did I ever back you for money? No. Did I ever tell you anything of THE THOUSANDS OF THINGS THAT I'VE TOLD you in the name of the Lord but didn't come to pass? Amen. Then don't never join an organization. &gt;&gt; I wish he could have added. &gt;&gt; Don't ever become an organization. &gt;&gt; IT'S AGAINST THE WORD OF GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Come out of it of of it &gt;&gt; if you're in it &gt;&gt; and be separate &gt;&gt; and receive the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that &gt;&gt; while I was worshiping here this tonight, &gt;&gt; I want to say to you, positioning is key. To be positioned is key. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of you can't grow. And I'm not just speaking to this assembly. I know there's a body of people that is listening. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; You can't enter into the promise. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; you can't receive. People's positioning is key. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pastor Shia was in grade once, six years old. And nanny, I learned a great lesson from my from my late grandmother. I come from school. She looked at this plant. She said to me, "Joe, move, Joe." She said to me, "Joseph, move this plant. HE MAY LOOK GREEN, BUT HE WILL never bloom. Whilst he's positioned here, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; YOU'LL NEVER SEE A FLOWER WHILE HE'S HERE. HE MIGHT BE GREEN, BUT YOU'LL NEVER SEE THAT THIS THIS PLANT WILL EVER HAVE A FLOWER. &gt;&gt; One of the biggest lessons I've learned, Revelations 18 speaks about, let me tell you now, it's it's a great warning. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Africans, WE SAY MY DUTCH LADIES WILL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. What it means? It means a avoid where the plagues fall. &gt;&gt; Avoid. HERE'S YOUR HERE'S OUR challenge &gt;&gt; because judgment is eminent. &gt;&gt; That's right. ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; THE GREAT BABYLON IS ABOUT IS IS is in the process of falling. &gt;&gt; You better get come out of it. Don't just put your name. It's quite easy to sign up. &gt;&gt; They send you a Google form. They send you anything and you sign up. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; If you're positioned with the plagues, you're going to be a partaker of the plagues. You're going to exactly receive the pains, &gt;&gt; the punishment, &gt;&gt; the fruit of that positioning, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; You got to come out of it. &gt;&gt; You got to come out of it. YOU CANNOT ORGANIZE YOURSELF. YOU CANNOT BE POSITIONED in the same manner because God's got a position AGAINST IT. THAT'S WHY I'm here TO SOUND THE ALARM TO COME OUT OF HER. DO NOT BE ASSOCIATED WITH HER. &gt;&gt; SHE'S ABOUT TO RECEIVE &gt;&gt; HER REWARDS. I wish I had more time, &gt;&gt; but it's time. Pastor Shel was saying Abram interceded for Lot. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you now, the evangelism has become for us TO CALL OUR FAMILIES OUT OF THEM. THE EVANGELIST HAS become to to to bring people that was exposed to the truth THAT HEARD THIS MESSAGE, COME OUT OF HER TO TELL THEM, "LEAVE YOUR STUFF. GET OUT OF IT. YOU'RE GOING TO RECEIVE YOUR REWARDS." &gt;&gt; Look at just what Luke 17:E1 Luke 17 verse 28 says. Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot, &gt;&gt; they did eat, &gt;&gt; they drank, &gt;&gt; they bought, THEY SOLD, THEY PLANTED, THEY BUILD IT. &gt;&gt; BUT THE SAME DAY that Lot went out of Sodom, &gt;&gt; IT RAINED FIRE AND BRIMSTONE. &gt;&gt; You got to come out of it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Lot had to move. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; You got to get out of her. &gt;&gt; Revelation. If you see the seven themes that emerge out of that &gt;&gt; and I will not be able to tell you to TALK YOU THROUGH ALL OF THEM TONIGHT. But the first ONE IS BABYLON HAS FALLEN HAS BECOME A HABITAT A HABITAT OF DEVILS. &gt;&gt; I want to give you this portion of scripture. &gt;&gt; If you can turn to Jeremiah 7 verse 10 and 11 in the amplified version. If you want to know how a safe a safe house looks, this is what has become which used to be the house of the Lord. HAS BECOME A SAFE HOUSE, HAS BECOME A PLACE OF RETREAT, a place to protect sinful deeds. &gt;&gt; I protect you. you protect me and we don't tell nobody that we are doing this thing. &gt;&gt; We don't even mind coming to THE PULLPIT THAT WE'VE SET ASIDE FOR GOD. &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD. &gt;&gt; THIS PULLPIT BELONGS TO TO GOD. THIS IS WHERE WHERE HE SENDS off his work from here. And we don't even have respect for the pulpit of the Lord. But I'm not going to bring justice to this portion of scripture. I I want to read it to you so that you can understand. And Jeremiah prophesied and he says in verse 10 and he says, "And then dare to come and stand before me in this house which is called by my name and say we are protected and set free BY THIS ACT OF RELIGIOUS ritual only to go on with this wickedness and these disgusting and loathome things. Has this house which is called by my name become a den of robbers in your eyes? A place of retreat for you between acts of violence. Behold, I myself have seen it, says the Lord. Beloveds, the hour is serious. &gt;&gt; It has become serious. &gt;&gt; This is where you see the danger is the rewards of being a partaker. SILENCE BY YOU REMAINING SILENT ON THINGS that you got to open your mouths make you a partaker of that sin. And you see corporately this great Babylon has corporately sinned against God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This this this great Babylon which which is the house OF GOD WHICH STARTED OFF NOY. He said, "Sir, &gt;&gt; they started off well, &gt;&gt; but then they started to lose it. &gt;&gt; If I go back to that dream, I can tell you now, if you go back to the dream, we try to be able, we know that woman is dead. You can speak to many pastors. You can speak to many leaders. You can speak to many congregations. If they are truthful with their assemblies, they will tell you &gt;&gt; there is nothing for you here. Come on now. &gt;&gt; YOU LIE AT THAT AT AT AT at the bath of uh of BETHESDA AND YOU WAITING AND YOU KNOW THERE IS NOTHING for you in there and they also know. But the delicacies the business case. You see, church has got a many churches got a business case. &gt;&gt; You feel we've become rich. We've become wealthy. &gt;&gt; But the prophet, he turned to us &gt;&gt; and he says, "Please don't join. Don't &gt;&gt; whatever you do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come out of her. &gt;&gt; We got to come out of her. &gt;&gt; You got to be Here's the problem. You will never GET INTO THAT PLACE BECAUSE THAT PLACE IS DOOMED. &gt;&gt; That place GOT ALREADY HIS JUDGMENT OVER IT. &gt;&gt; And no matter Let me tell you now, you can change your worship. You can change your sound system. &gt;&gt; You can change &gt;&gt; the way. You can bring in new people. &gt;&gt; You can try to be able to organize and you can do whatever you do. &gt;&gt; If it's dead, it's dead. Let me tell you now, I'm I I don't I I have I've never been fooled by our wonderful people. I can tell you now in this world, I I I met a musician. He's he's one of the greatest pianists in South Africa. And he says to me, "You know what? If I want people to cry, I know exactly what key to play. I come out of an era where I didn't need a song to get me into the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; We've been fooled. We've been fooled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I tend to think and it's wonderful. I can tell you now. I Benjamin I so enjoy the worship because I can see you give yourself. &gt;&gt; You give yourself we we do have people last night they played in a lounge they last night they played in a club. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Exactly right. &gt;&gt; And they tend to think it is just by getting onto the stage. going to church. &gt;&gt; It has become a robber's den. &gt;&gt; It has become we even now get into a position where we actually says I'm no longer playing for free. &gt;&gt; We want money because the delicacies the delicacies, the business case, &gt;&gt; the merchants, those that is looking at this and you know what the charismatic has mastered the art. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The business case is is they know exactly if if I get 5,000 people in this auditorium AND ON AVERAGE EVERYBODY JUST GIVE ONE $10. That's why you'll see look what has happened with our services. When I started when when I came to Christ 4 hours 6 hours in a service was not a problem. &gt;&gt; No one left. &gt;&gt; But just look how they do it nowadays. If I can fit in three services in the morning &gt;&gt; because it's not about it's not about the word. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; it's about the trading. It's about the merchant case. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you now, we are not excused. &gt;&gt; We are not excused &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE THAT WE'VE RECEIVED in 62. THE MESSAGE THAT WE'VE HEARD IN 58. &gt;&gt; He warns us. True. &gt;&gt; And God is reminding us here tonight &gt;&gt; that woman is dead. &gt;&gt; Come out of her. &gt;&gt; Wish I had long more time. &gt;&gt; The rewards. Here's your dilemma. People receive. Let me tell you now. If you've been positioned wrongly, &gt;&gt; if you've been placed in a in an organization where there is happening sin, that's why be careful who lay their hand their hands on you. &gt;&gt; The transfer &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; don't just run to every uh h uh uh event, &gt;&gt; right? and let anybody lay your hands upon you. &gt;&gt; You know your pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know your leadership. &gt;&gt; You will get from that con convention and you'll feel why you looking differently at that woman and why you looking differently at that man. You will come in here and it was all along okay. You will find all of a sudden &gt;&gt; mistakes here &gt;&gt; because you've picked up &gt;&gt; a wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you've been wrongly positioned. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've become a partaker of the sins that is happening there. Right. &gt;&gt; Few years back I heard a message from the pullpit. Come out of THE CAVE OF ABDULLAH. &gt;&gt; GOD HAD TO CALL DAVID OUT OF THE CAVE OF ABDULLAM BECAUSE IN THAT CAVE WAS DISTRESS, DEBT AND DISCONTENTMENT. &gt;&gt; AND AS LONG AS DAVID WAS IN THAT IN THAT CAVE, HE FELT DISCONTENTED. HE FELT FULL OF DEBT. HE FELT HE FELT DISMAYED because he was wrongly positioned. &gt;&gt; I don't even want to talk tonight about fornication &gt;&gt; because fornication speak exactly about misrepresentation. That's right. &gt;&gt; And this TEACHER OF THIS HOUSE TAUGHT ME what the difference is between adultery and fornication. &gt;&gt; Because fornication is about misrepresentation. What you see they misrepresent. &gt;&gt; A BODY THAT IS DEAD AND IT LOOKS ALIVE. Don't be alarmed with what you see on YouTube and on Tik Tok and all of these things. &gt;&gt; The older people says to us, just scratch beneath the surface and YOU'LL FIND THE DEVIL'S IS UNDERNEATH THAT. &gt;&gt; The hour is late. The hour has become so late. It has become so late. I cannot just sign up my name. I cannot just be in connected to anybody &gt;&gt; or subscribe. &gt;&gt; God has called his pride out of it. &gt;&gt; God has called us out of her. God wants to be able to make sure you see what we've seen last night here is the calling out of a new generation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know if the young people the youngsters REALIZE WHAT PROPHETICALLY HAS HAPPENED HERE TONIGHT last night in this place. &gt;&gt; It speaks about your positioning to go and possess. &gt;&gt; BUT HERE'S YOUR PROBLEM. IF YOU ARE WRONGLY ALIGNED, you're going to miss it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you now. Why did those men of war died IN THE DESERT? &gt;&gt; THEY DIED BECAUSE of unbelief. God knows you believe. The the prophet, he taught us an old song. Only believe. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Let me tell you now, Mark 16. The first time I heard it, Pastor Shelly, Mark 16. Somebody quoted that scripture to me, but I caught the last portion. And we don't preach that. He says, "If you believe, if you believe, these signs shall follow. You shall speak in new tongues. YOU SHALL LAY YOUR HANDS UPON THE SICK and they shall be healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is your promise. &gt;&gt; That's why I can't look at those those heel of what did you say, brother? Brother Wes, last night they the heel of the four skins. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. There's a greater promise. &gt;&gt; There's a greater promise. &gt;&gt; Many of us has missed it. Think about it. Where should we have been from the 60s till now if we've just embraced it? &gt;&gt; If we've just caught on. if we've just instead of just embracing the quote. But you see it's it's it it is about taking that quote and says Lord I want to own this. I want this word not just to become a word but it MUST BECOME AN INSPIRED WORD IN my life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to be able to MAKE SURE THAT THE WORD IS VESTED IN US. &gt;&gt; I want to encourage the young people. I can tell you now, I did not rest because I wanted to see those signs and I saw that signs. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you see, no matter where you go, if you've been if you've been called out by God, &gt;&gt; his signs will be demonstrated through your lives. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, Pastor Shelly, I was 10 years old. We I grew up in the Protestant church where they baptize sprinkles and my mother's brother's wife started to come and live on this. My grand my my grandfather had a farm and on these farms all the families will live will each have their own cottage etc. And when they came to come and live there, they realized that this children was not been baptized. And as traditionally what will happen, they will place pressure on the family by saying if this children dies, &gt;&gt; some of you can relate to that. That's the only reason why they will number push number one push you to have holy communion and to be able to have to to be baptized because that was the message been preached to people &gt;&gt; and I'm 10 years old. My aunt bring her two children. They were my my cousins. One was 10 and the other one was 11. Pastor Shel, I've never heard tongues in my life. I didn't know what it was at the time because my parents because the I'm talking about a period where Pentecost was a set. &gt;&gt; Is that the right word that I'm using there? And she came up. When she got there, Pastor Shelly, this woman went off in a tongue. But I knew even then, this is God. I knew when I heard it, I said, I want I want that. &gt;&gt; I knew that is something. No choruses was played, no music. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit do not need a a song. The Holy Spirit do not need a music uh line. The Holy Spirit doesn't need the a specific envi a specific environment that you need to create. &gt;&gt; That's right. And the spirit fell on her. After church, I went to my mom. She went on most probably. She disturbed the they said she disturbed the church. &gt;&gt; Because it was approximately she went on for 10 minutes in tongues. I went to my mom. I said, "Mom, what went on?" She said, "Don't worry about that. I think that woman was just crazy. &gt;&gt; She didn't wanted the children to be baptized, but they never told told us a year later they had another child. Same thing happened. Woman went off in tongues up until today. Only now when I look back, I started to realize positioning is key. &gt;&gt; Position is key for you. &gt;&gt; There's a flip side to that. &gt;&gt; There's a flip side to that. You may most probably consider most probably becoming tired of this type of of of of service. Most probably tired of being in an environment like this. Don't miss your opportunity. &gt;&gt; I want to close off Nicodemus. He knew Nicodemus &gt;&gt; knew but it was stored. He was called out. Christ called him out. He said if you wants to become a new man, you got to be baptized. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. He said to him, "YOU BETTER COME OUT OF HER." But it was still hard because he had to weigh up. This is how I've been reared. This is what I've been exposed to. This is what how I've received it. &gt;&gt; This is how we to be. &gt;&gt; You cannot place God in a box. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit you can't place in a box. The same spirit that worked in the days of William Brandham is the same spirit that can work today. &gt;&gt; Don't place God in a box. &gt;&gt; Don't put the Holy Spirit in a box. &gt;&gt; I want you to be able to see tonight God is calling us out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Pastor Shelly, the message is serious. &gt;&gt; We got to be able to watch oursel as as men that is leading a flock. &gt;&gt; We got to be we got to be monitor and to be able to say, "Lord, let me align ourselves with you. [Music] Most I think I I did what I had to do. &gt;&gt; I did what I had to do. But Dwayne, &gt;&gt; I know I've said so much. I'm not so sure if you're going to sing for us or what. You've got to be able to do so. [Applause] I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe it. Now we're coming out again. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Could the musicians come back for just a moment, please? &gt;&gt; What a word. What a word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name. &gt;&gt; I truly count it an honor to be with you this evening. It's an awesome place to stand in front of the bride of Christ. That's &gt;&gt; right. Awesome place to stand right here. If you know the song this evening, would you sing it with me? [Music] The gulf that separated [Music] me from Christ my Lord. [Music] It was so vast. The crossing I could never go. From where I was to his domain, it seemed so far. [Music] I cried, "Dear Lord, I cannot come to where you are." He came to me. He came to me. [Music] When I couldn't come to where he was, he came to me. [Music] That's why he died on Calary. When I couldn't come to where he was, he came to me. He came to me when I was bound in chains of sin. [Music] Oh, he came to me when I possessed no hope within. [Music] Oh, he picked me up and drew me gently to his side. Oh, where today in his sweet love I now abide for he came to me. Oh, he came to me. [Music] For when I couldn't come to where he was, oh, he came to me. Oh, that's why he died. Calary [Music] for when I couldn't come to where he was. Oh, he came to me. Oh, he came to me. Yes. He came to me when I could come to where he was. He came to me. [Music] Oh, that's why he died. Oh, [Music] for when I couldn't come to where he was, he came. Oh, would you lift it up to him one more time this evening? Oh, he came to me. He came to me. When I couldn't come to where he was, he came to me. Hallelujah. [Music] I'm the reason he died on Calary. For when I couldn't come to where he was, he came to me. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Aren't you thankful? Aren't you thankful? [Music] &gt;&gt; You were in a place that you could not get to him, but thank God he could come &gt;&gt; to me. Hallelujah. Praise his wonderful name. Thank y'all so much. I appreciate that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you turn with me? I want to I'll try to move very quickly this evening to the book of Psalms, chapter 107, verse one. &gt;&gt; Oh, give thanks unto the Lord &gt;&gt; for he is what? &gt;&gt; Good. And his mercy endureth. That word endureth means to continue in the same state forever. &gt;&gt; His mercy endureth forever. Verse two. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so. &gt;&gt; Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy. How many redeemed we have here this evening. We have a voice tonight. We can say I have been redeemed. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. Pray that the Lord will will help me to get out of the way this evening and uh and we can just enter right into his his word. I tell you the the word from brother Joe there was just just so wonderful. So wonderful and and so rich. All all of his word all of God's word is rich. &gt;&gt; So rich. In the book of Joel, chapter 2, um y'all know me by now I don't bring you anything new, but I I'd like to just stir up your minds. Uh this evening, Joel chapter 2, it says, "And I will restore to you the years that the locust have eaten, the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm. My great army, his army." &gt;&gt; That wasn't Satan's army. &gt;&gt; That was his army. My great army which I sent among you. And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied. And praise the name of the Lord your God, that he hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed. In the book of Exodus 2 verse 23-2, it says, "And it came to pass in the process of time that the king of Egypt died and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage and God heard their groaning &gt;&gt; and God remembered his covenant &gt;&gt; with Abraham." You know, there's things that God will remember and there's some some things he chooses not to remember &gt;&gt; in in the word a different place. I don't have it written down, but it just comes to my remembrance. There's there's a place where he says about our sins. He says, "I will remember them no more." &gt;&gt; Now, I've heard many people say that God God forgets. He forgets it. He doesn't forget it. &gt;&gt; He just chooses not to remember it. He chooses not to bring it to your account anymore. There's a whole difference between somebody being forgetful or somebody making a a cognizant choice that says, "I will not because of what I've done for you, &gt;&gt; because of the covenant he has given to us, &gt;&gt; I will not bring it to my remembrance against you anymore. Will not charge you with that." &gt;&gt; That wasn't that wasn't in there. my covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob, and God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them. &gt;&gt; You know, it's good to know that in a time of trouble, in a time of despair, in a lowly state you might find yourself in, and you cry out to him, guess what? He hears. &gt;&gt; He hears and he answers. &gt;&gt; And he remembers his covenant. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The thing I like about God's covenant with me, it's not a bilateral agreement. &gt;&gt; Anybody know about bilateral agreements or unilateral agreements? &gt;&gt; It's unilateral, meaning it only takes him &gt;&gt; to place it into effect. &gt;&gt; Only him. You ain't got to do nothing about it. &gt;&gt; If he makes a covenant, you know, there was many covenants he made and Israel, they they went against it. He would he would say, "If you'll do this, I'll do this. if you'll do this, I'll do that. And every time they failed, &gt;&gt; and so he comes down to a point, he says, I'm just going to make a covenant with you that I'm going to uphold. &gt;&gt; I'm taking you out of the equation. It was a unilateral agreement. And he remembers his covenant. &gt;&gt; He will not forget his covenant to you. He cares about you. He loves you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I' I'd like to talk to you just a few minutes, if I can keep it to a few minutes, about the the the kindness of a king. the kindness of a king. And I tell you, we serve the greatest king. You the what the the theme of the of of the uh the meetings this week is living in his goodness, I believe, is is is the theme. And um I I I wasn't excuse me. I I wasn't thinking I was going to be speaking this this night, but that that's that's fine. And and I just want the Lord to to move this e this evening. This morning I was I I was listening to a a a song and as I was doing some some studying and and and a song came on um that I was or it was actually some words that I had written down in in one of my notes and and to a song and I just started I started singing this the song out as I was reading through my notes and we'll get we'll get to that a little bit later. But as I started singing the song, I just broke out broke down into tears because the Lord, the Holy Spirit just moved in the room with me and said, "This is it. This is what you're supposed to talk about." So, you know, we we look back at at the uh the the promises that was given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and we, you know, we'll we'll say among ourselves, that's that's that's really pretty words. &gt;&gt; That that was really pretty. It's great that he did that for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. &gt;&gt; But what about me? What about me? In the book of Galatians, if you'll look at Galatians chapter 3 7-9, it says, "Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, &gt;&gt; the same are &gt;&gt; the children of Abraham, &gt;&gt; and the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. So it wasn't just a promise and just nice words to him. It was to you if you are in faith. If you if you move on down to verse 29, it says, "And if ye be Christ, &gt;&gt; if ye be Christ, then ye are Abraham's seed and &gt;&gt; hes &gt;&gt; according to the promise." &gt;&gt; It there there's so much heirs of what? Heirs to everything. Everything that he gave in his covenant, you are a an heir to that. So, there's been a covenant of love that's been promised to you and it's been promised to me. And he wants to, this is the thing, he he's the the best husband that you could ever have &gt;&gt; because he wants to bestow his love and his favor and his kindness on you. You know, sometimes there there's things that that we as as husbands want to do for our family, for our our wives, and maybe sometimes the finances just aren't there to do it. You have it in your heart. You want to do it for them. You want to to just uh lavish your your love on them and your blessings and all these different things. But sometimes finances get in the way. You don't have it to do. But see, he don't have that problem. &gt;&gt; He don't have that problem. And he wants to just he wants to lavish himself on you this evening. He wants to pour himself out to you. And if we would just come to a place that that we would cry out unto him, &gt;&gt; we cry out unto him. Guess what? He responds. that he he's not going to turn a dead ear to you. He will not. If you cry out unto him, have you ever had one of your children cry out your name? &gt;&gt; They they cry out mommy or daddy, you there could be a lot of mommies and daddies in the room. But I guess I guarantee you if your child cries out mommy or daddy, you hear &gt;&gt; their voice &gt;&gt; and you don't look for somebody else to go take care of them. Some do. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe some do. &gt;&gt; You shouldn't look for somebody else to go take care of them. &gt;&gt; There should be that that in your heart that you hear that cry and you jump from whatever you're doing. Everything gets put down and you go to take care of them. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HE DOES FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; AS SOON AS YOU CRY OUT to him, he's right there. &gt;&gt; He's right there. What was it when when Peter cried out to him? Peter was was it was walking on the water and and he was he was sinking because he got his eyes off of Christ. Got his eyes onto his problems that was all around him and he took his eyes off of him and then he cried out to him. The Bible says he immediately well he couldn't immediately reach down his hand to him if he wasn't already there right with him. &gt;&gt; Now I don't know the proximity of Jesus before Peter called out. But I guarantee you as soon as he called out, he was right there. He's Jehovah Shyama. He is present in your trouble. &gt;&gt; Not just in a time of trouble, &gt;&gt; but he is present in &gt;&gt; trouble. Now, this is this is a little an offside note here. If if Satan is trying to to get you into trouble, you can look at it this way. All he is doing is escorting you into the presence of God. Because if he is present in your trouble and Satan tries to place you into trouble, he just escorted you into the presence of God. In the message, believest thou this. &gt;&gt; You hadn't thought about that, had you? &gt;&gt; He did. He took me right into his presence. &gt;&gt; In the message, believest thou this, 1950, Brother Bram says, "Now God made a covenant with the church &gt;&gt; and he wrote it out. He he wrote out his covenant &gt;&gt; with the many people don't read. &gt;&gt; They don't read the covenant enough. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know if how many of you ever been called to they used to in in the in in the olden days they would have the reading of a will. &gt;&gt; You know, and if your name was in was placed in the will, they would reach out to you. They say we're going to have a reading of the will on such and such date. Here's his will. &gt;&gt; Here's his Exactly. It's unsealed. &gt;&gt; If you want to know what is yours, just open it up &gt;&gt; and read it. It's right there for you. He wrote it out the Bible. And on the day of the atonement, God killed his son. You believe it? Tore him apart. and he took his body up to the right hand of his majesty and sent his spirit back as a covenant to us. And at that day, unless we have the same Holy Spirit in us, &gt;&gt; we can't go in the body. &gt;&gt; It's imperative that you have that Holy Spirit dwelling within you. That is your token. &gt;&gt; That That's what's going to get you in. You've got to have the Holy Spirit, man. You know, well, how how do you know how how do you know if you have the Holy Spirit? It's going to be doing the same thing as it's always done before. &gt;&gt; It's going to be a same display of what it has done in the past. It's going to do the same today. If you have that Holy Spirit dwelling within you, Galatians 5:22:23 says, "But the fruit of the spirit &gt;&gt; is love, &gt;&gt; joy, &gt;&gt; peace, &gt;&gt; we could all use a little bit more peace. &gt;&gt; I can use more peace. &gt;&gt; All of them. The next one is tough. Longsuffering. I don't want to put up with people that long sometimes. &gt;&gt; But the Holy Spirit within me &gt;&gt; makes provision for that &gt;&gt; if we will yield &gt;&gt; to the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; in us. Gentleness, goodness, goodness or kindness can be replaced there. Um faith, meekness, temperance. Against such there is no law. So if you have the Holy Spirit in you, it's going to be producing the right fruit. &gt;&gt; You agree with me on that? &gt;&gt; So have you ever have you ever had a thought or a wonder in your mind? You know, all these things that God has done for me, he's given me all these things. What does he require of me? &gt;&gt; You know that there's there's a scripture that tells you what he requires of you &gt;&gt; in the book of Micah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Little book of Micah 6:8. It reads, "He hath showed thee, oh man, what is good, &gt;&gt; and what do the Lord require of thee, &gt;&gt; but to do justly, &gt;&gt; and to love mercy, &gt;&gt; and to walk humbly with God." &gt;&gt; And that don't sound difficult at all, does it? to love mercy. Oh, I love it when somebody has mercy for me. &gt;&gt; I love it when somebody has grace for me. &gt;&gt; I love it when somebody has longsuffering with me. &gt;&gt; But what does it mean for you to love mercy towards somebody else? And there's a um I I I I I like to look up words and um so I I looked up I said it's got to be something more to it than than just what you see on the surface and the the topical approach there, you know, that that it's got to be deeper than just love mercy. So I I had to look up that phrase, &gt;&gt; love mercy. And the word mercy that was that was in the original in the Hebrew that was used there is spelled c hes d and I don't pronounce Hebrew very well so I will try it has so it's a small word but it has a really big meaning has in the is is not it's not even used that that word said is not even used in the New Testament. I I found that odd. I thought that it would be, but it was used throughout the Old Testament. The closest thing that you could find in the New Testament that was that would mimic it or or be a synonym of it would be charity or grace &gt;&gt; or I'm sorry, not charity. Um, C H A R I S C Chis. Yeah. So, it's Greek, but it was C H A R I S. Uh, which interpreted is grace. And you know it throughout time the Bible scholars they they've complained um as I was doing some reading about the the word hed they they complained that that it's it's so difficult to translate that word into English because it really has no precise equivalent word in our language. Um so they the closest that they could get in in scripture the closest that they could get when they were trying to translate it is they they made up the word loving kindness. Brother brother brother Brandon would talk would talk about thy loving kindness and it was it was a strange concept to him about loving thy loving kindness is better than life. He he would say that that didn't make didn't make a whole lot of sense to him. How could how could anything be better and greater than life? But his and brother Brown would use he would he would shorten he said I love kindness. But the loving kindness is what what it's talking about. But loving kindness it it it's represented by other words like mercy, steadfast love, sometimes loyalty. But as I was reading through it and and looking at it, if if you look at the words, all of this list of words that they use to try to describe this single word said, then it it it closely relates to the nine fruits of the spirit. &gt;&gt; You you almost look at every single one of them. You're like, "Okay, that was that that's what I'm supposed to be presenting." If the Holy Spirit is in me, then the fruit of the Holy Spirit is has said &gt;&gt; it's it's not just it's it's not just a very small thing. It's it's it's rather enormous. And and I don't believe it's coincidental. I I believe it's I believe it's designed by God that way that it wasn't just something whenever he says that's what he requires of us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; His love, &gt;&gt; his love, &gt;&gt; not your love. He requires of you his love towards somebody because I love people in a different way than Christ loved people. &gt;&gt; You know that there's times that that that something is said to me that that I kind of I buck up against and and I can't it's hard for me to to let it go. &gt;&gt; But see, he chooses not to remember those things. But oh my goodness, it's hard for us in our humanity to let some of those things go and and just walk away from it and say, you know what, I just choose not to think about that no more. I'm going to I'm going to set it down and I'm not going to hold it against them. See, a lot of people says, well, you know, I'll forgive you, but I'm not going to forget it. &gt;&gt; And the next time that they're around you, in their mind, they're still thinking about something that happened 20 years ago. It it could have been just a few words that was illspoken and they let it linger and it just lets it dig and dig and gets deeper and deeper &gt;&gt; and it takes a hold of a person and they there's no way to get rid of it &gt;&gt; in their own self. There's no way. &gt;&gt; The only thing that can take take that away is the Holy Spirit of God that comes in with a surgical knife. I I I thought it was so wonderful last last night as as brother brother Wesley was talking about carving it away all the excess, cutting it away that we've got to get rid of all this excess things in our life. If you're ever going to draw closer to Christ, you're not going to draw closer to him with all of the things of the world attached to you. You're not going to draw close to him with hatred attached to you. You're not going to draw close to him with bitterness and grudges or any of those types of things. The only thing that draws close to Christ is Christ. &gt;&gt; The only thing that draws close to Christ is Christ. And the only thing that he will draw close to, guess what? Is himself. &gt;&gt; So if you don't have himself living in you, he's not going to draw close to you. &gt;&gt; That's the only way. And we've got to have that union. We've got Y'all had communion the other night. You've got to have If you ever looked at at the word communion, it's a very intimate word. It's it's it's you know we we use the the word when we're talking about the the bread and the wine, but it you you look up the word communion and and the way it was presented in scripture. It's a very it's an intimacy between between &gt;&gt; a husband and a wife. &gt;&gt; It's very intimate. I I'll just I'll leave it leave it at that. And and and but that's what he wants to have with us. But he will not he will not be intimate &gt;&gt; unless it's the same spirit. &gt;&gt; That's that's all it's going to be. It it has to be that way. Sorry that wasn't in the notes either. Um but he he he gave it to me. You know, there there's a song there's a song that was written um back in the late 1800s um by a man named George Mat. And uh you you may have I know you have heard heard the song. You may have sung it years and years ago. Oh love that will not let me go. George Mat wrote that song. He was born in 1842. He died in 1906. But at the age of 20 he he was he was engaged to uh to be married. And at the age of 20, right before they was going to be married, he found out that he was going blind. and his fiance decided she wanted nothing to do with him because she did not want to live and take care of someone who was blind. So she walked away from him. They they were they were at the at the point of getting married. So he ended up living with his sister for 20 20 more years. He lived with his sister and and at over that time his eyesight got worse and worse to a point that he became completely blind. His sister took care of him and then after 20 years his sister ended up getting married. Yeah. I think it was Yeah. Yeah. She was getting married and on the eve of his sister's wedding is whenever he pinned these words. Oh love that will not let me go. I rest my weary soul in thee. I give thee back the life I owe. That in thine ocean depths it flows. May richer, fuller be. See, he he he came to a place he was heartbroken. His fiance had already dropped him. She already let him go. And now his sister who had took care of him, she was getting married and he wasn't going to be able to stay with them. And he was he was at a point of despair. He he was he said, "I I've already been let go here and I'm being let go here. I've been let down over here and now my sister's letting me go, too. She's she's dropping the ball on me. Where am I going to go?" And the only place he could turn to &gt;&gt; was God. And these words came to him and he wrote the song, oh love that will will not let me go. He took Soulless in a love &gt;&gt; that would not &gt;&gt; could not &gt;&gt; and will not let you go. &gt;&gt; His His love is everlasting. &gt;&gt; He will not with everybody else. When the world forgets about you, &gt;&gt; sometimes even your family seemingly forgets about you. you you become in in their eyes, you become a burden, you know, to to some people, they they become they they feel like they're a burden. They become ostracized from their family and the family doesn't want anything to do with them and they they they have nobody. They feel like they have I don't where do I turn to? I have nobody. &gt;&gt; But there is a love that you can turn to. &gt;&gt; That love his love will not &gt;&gt; it cannot &gt;&gt; cannot let you go. There's a whole lot of examples in in the scripture um about I said God's covenant love. You can find it in Genesis. You find it in Esther. You find it in Ruth. Find it in a bunch of places. I'm not going to spend spend a whole lot of time with with all the different ones, but I I do want to I just I want to draw your attention to to one story this evening. And uh this this is something that just really it really as I as I was thinking of the song this morning, it really just spoke to me. And um you know just in the book of Samuel um you set the stage with it. Samuel um chapter 4 in verse 4 says, "And Jonathan Saul's son had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old. When the tidings came of Saul, I think I don't Yeah. tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezrael and his nurse took him up and fled. And it came to pass as she made haste to flee that he fell &gt;&gt; and became lame and his name was Mphibicheth. &gt;&gt; You know, I I often wondered whenever I I've read the story of Mphibicheth and and and wondered you what what happened. I mean, you it tells us, you know, he he was dropped and and and and but in my in my mind, I mean, I've I've not proud of it, but I've I've dropped my child before, you know, I wasn't trying to, but you know that sometimes they're moving around, you're you're playing with them or something, you dropped them and and it didn't break their feet, you know, it it didn't it didn't break them to a point that they were lame. So, you know, I I don't I don't know. I I mean, I could imagine different things going. I mean, they were trying to flee from from an from an army. So, I don't I don't know if if if in that time that that had happened, if if you know, if he he got dropped and maybe stepped on, you know, maybe a horse or something, they they're coming through or the people got trampled on. I don't I don't know. But I feel like it was something a little bit more severe than just just a drop, you know, but I I for him to be lame in his feet. But you if you you know you you you start looking at that and and you realize that that really in in at some point in each one of our lives &gt;&gt; every single one of us have come to a place that we feel like we've been dropped &gt;&gt; that we've been let down. you you had your you had your trust and your faith and your your hope in in maybe a person, you know, it could have been it could have been a family member that that you really looked up to and you really held on to every word that they said &gt;&gt; and suddenly it's just gone and you just feel like now what do I do now? &gt;&gt; What do I do now? what they were telling me, you know, they I found out that it was just superficial. It was just it was just words, you know. They were just like like people like to use the word salad, you know. They were just spewing off things and whenever it really comes down to where the rubber meets the road, you find out it wasn't even real, you know, and and so sometimes things happen that like that and and we we you know, we you might have had somebody in that um that you that you placed faith in that you're like, I I'm trusting you to give me words of life. And then all of a sudden, you know, either they're gone or they go off the word and you realize you've been dropped. You've been let down. &gt;&gt; You know, you've been led down a wrong path. &gt;&gt; And and you feel you you feel betrayed. &gt;&gt; You feel betrayed. And it wasn't even of your own doing. &gt;&gt; It just circumstances made it that way. And now you're lame. You know, you're you're struggling to find a foothold. you're you're struggling for for for many years maybe after that you're each every day is a struggle. It's a fight. It's a battle for you just to just to get up and go that day that next day you're you're struggling in your mind because all the different things that's happened and you're like who's the next person that's going to let me down? How how can I now put my faith in somebody else? How can I trust somebody else to lead me, to guide me, to point me in the right direction because some somebody said something over here and I come to find out that it was wrong, it was misleading, and I feel betrayed and I feel dropped. It takes a lot to trust somebody. &gt;&gt; It it it takes a lot. Have you ever you ever seen people do what they call trust falls? &gt;&gt; I'm not going to do a trust fall. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to do that as an example this evening either because I'd be afraid that somebody would say, "Don't trust in in man, trust in God." And they just move out of the way and let you fall. I've seen do that. Exactly. They they they they coach you into it and say, "Yeah, do a trust fall." And then as soon as you start falling, they move out of the way and say, "Yeah, &gt;&gt; I trust in him. I'm going to I'm going to trust in him." In in 2 Samuel chapter 9, if it if you would allow me, I I want to read through um I want to read through this chapter. I can read fast if you can listen fast. Um, let's try it. Okay. And David said, "Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul that I may show him has said for Jonathan's sake?" See, he remembered the covenant that he had made with Jonathan. &gt;&gt; And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Zeba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, "Art thou Zeba?" And he said, "Thy servant is he?" And the king said, "Is there not yet any of the house of Saul that I may show the kindness of God unto him?" And Zeba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet. And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Zeba said unto the king, "Behold, he is in the house of Mahir, if I say that correct, the son of Amiel in Loabar, the king David," then King David sent and fetched him out of the house of Makir, the son of Amile from Loabar. Now when Mphibicheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face and did reverence, and David said, Mphibicheth, and he answered, Behold thy servant. I I I like the humility that he was presenting. You know, I I'm I'm thinking that Mphibicheth was wondering why was he being called in front of the king when his grandfather had been the previous king. And if you know the traditions of the time, they would kill all the members of the previous family. So in his mind, you know, he's like, I'm not exactly sure why I'm being called in front of this king, but I'm going to be I'm going to show humility. I'm not going to stand up and be prideful and say, this is where I'm supposed to be. No, he went with humility before And David said unto him, "Fear not, for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father, and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually." And he bowed himself, and said, "What is thy servant that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?" Sounds kind of like Peter, you know, in Luke where he said, "Depart from me. I'm a I'm a sinful man, oh Lord. He He approached him with the right attitude. He He approached him with humility. Verse 9 says, "Then the king called to Zeba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son, all that pertain to Saul, and to all his house. Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants shall till the land for him. Thou shalt bring in the fruits, and thy master's son may have food to eat. But Mphibicheth, thy master's son, shall eat bread always at my table. Now Zeba had 15 sons and 20 servants. Then then said Zeba unto the king, according to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mphibicheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table as one of the king's sons. And Mphibicheth had a young son whose name was Micah. And all that dwelt in the house of Zeba were servants unto Mphibicheth. So Mphibicheth dwelt in Jerusalem, for he did eat continually at the king's table and was lame on both his feet. You know the the the thing about about that story if you you you start thinking about the condition of Mphibicheth. &gt;&gt; Every single time he had to be taken somewhere or was wanting to go somewhere, somebody had to carry him. &gt;&gt; Every single time. No matter if he was 6 years old, 16 years old, 26 years old, or what age he was at, the lameness in his feet prevented him from moving about freely. And he always had to be carried wherever he went, &gt;&gt; no matter what. And and sometimes people that are around you and they if if if they're feeling like they're they're having to carry your burden all the time, sometimes they don't want to be, you know, sometimes they they're like, I I don't really want to hang out with them so much because every time I'm with them, I'm having to pick them up. &gt;&gt; Having to pick them up. But see, the thing wasn't it wasn't his fault. He didn't do anything. It wasn't it wasn't his fault that that he had gotten dropped. It wasn't his fault that he became lame in his feet. And I'm sure maybe in his own self it was it was kind of an embarrassment to him. You know, here here I am. I was supposed to be a prince. &gt;&gt; I I was in in the line of of Saul. I'm supposed to be a prince. &gt;&gt; I'm not supposed to be living in Loabar. I'm not supposed to be living in a place where nobody cares that that that nobody cares about your voice of what you have to say. You you cry out in Loabar, nobody's there to hear you. That's &gt;&gt; right. nobody there. There was no pastor. It was it was it was it was a dead place. And so many people are living in dead places. And our brother Joe was was saying, "We've been called out." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, he he had to be called out. He couldn't get himself out. &gt;&gt; But there was a call that came from a king &gt;&gt; to bring him out. And there's been a call that's come out to you tonight &gt;&gt; to bring you out &gt;&gt; of the death that you're dwelling in. Cuz that's what Loabar was. It was a It was a place you would go to die. It was it was just death there. There was no life there. Nobody cared about your problems cuz they had problems of their own. It was full of poverty. &gt;&gt; So he came from a palace and went to poverty. He he was going to be a prince and it became a popper &gt;&gt; and it wasn't anything he did. And sometimes the situations that we are in didn't really have anything to do with you. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Something else that somebody else did sometimes has caused you to be in that place. But there's a king tonight &gt;&gt; that wants to extend his kindness. He wants to extend his love. He wants to extend his mercy to you and tell you, you don't have to dwell in Loabar anymore. &gt;&gt; You don't have to dwell in death anymore. You don't have to dwell. I'm going to bring you. I'm going to sit you at my table. Now, the thing about the David to Mphibicheth, David had the power, he had the ability, he had the finances, he had everything, the authority to restore &gt;&gt; wealth. Praise God. &gt;&gt; He could restore wealth to &gt;&gt; Mphibicheth, &gt;&gt; but he could not restore health. &gt;&gt; He couldn't restore his feet. Even though he was now back in the palace, &gt;&gt; he was still lame. And and he was reminded of it every single time that he was called to the king's table. He still knew that I'm lame in my feet because servants had to come and pick him up &gt;&gt; and carry him. But see, we can come to a table tonight &gt;&gt; that he calls you to &gt;&gt; that gives you life, &gt;&gt; that can restore the brokenhearted, &gt;&gt; that can restore the damaged lives, the things the things where you have become lame in yourself, he can restore that. He's not just going to place you at his table and cover up because that's what at the table they didn't see the damage to his legs. Whenever he sat down at the table, he looked like everybody else. &gt;&gt; But whenever he had to leave that table, everybody knew, &gt;&gt; oh, that's Mphibicheth. &gt;&gt; He's lame in his feet. He got dropped whenever he was young. &gt;&gt; And it was constant in his mind. It happened to every single day. That would go over and over in his mind. But see, tonight, you don't have to stay in that mindset. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You don't have to stay in the mindset of Mphibicheth. You don't have to stay with lame feet. You don't have to stay defeated and and dragged down with all the worries and distress of the world. Let those things be cut off of you tonight. Let the master, let the king offer his love, offer his mercy to you tonight. Offer his healing to you. Cuz that's WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. &gt;&gt; He wants to make you whole. &gt;&gt; You're not going to come to his table and still be an invalid tonight. &gt;&gt; Mphibicheth did. Every single time he went to the to David's table, he was still an invalid. But tonight, God calls to you. &gt;&gt; He draws you. He invites you to come to his table. And he says, "If you'll come to me, &gt;&gt; you can rest. &gt;&gt; I can give you complete rest. I can take it take away any pain. anything that that this world has tried to lay on to you that maybe maybe a family member has burdened you with, I can take all of those things away. &gt;&gt; All you have to do is come to my table. &gt;&gt; Come come to my table. That's that's the kindness of a king. &gt;&gt; But see, he has the ability to do that tonight. and he wants to he wants to uh I want to invite the the musicians to come back. I want to share with you maybe just one one one more little uh little scripture or thought in and uh in the book of Ephesians chapter 2 verse 4-7 but God I tell you those two words but God &gt;&gt; I don't care what your problem is tonight I don't care what your brokenness is tonight. &gt;&gt; I don't care your heartaches, but God &gt;&gt; who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us. Even when we were dead in sins, &gt;&gt; he didn't wait till you were all cleaned up. Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ. By grace ye are saved, and hath raised us up together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; When when Christ was was raised up, where was he placed? At the right hand of the father. What's the right hand represent? power and authority. He has seated us in him in that spot. &gt;&gt; That's the position that we have been called to tonight. &gt;&gt; The same position that he holds is where he has quickened us and he has drawn us together with Christ. He's raised us up together, made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come, &gt;&gt; he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through Christ. Who raised you up? He did. Mphibicheth could not raise himself up. It had to be multiple people to raise him up. You tonight could not raise yourself up &gt;&gt; out of the sins of this world. &gt;&gt; Absolutely no way. &gt;&gt; You could not do it. There was no righteousness in you to be able to remove yourself from the sins of this world. But by his righteousness, &gt;&gt; by his grace, by his loving kindness, he chose you. He came to you when you couldn't go to him. &gt;&gt; There's so many I love love looking at things in the scripture that many times people went to Christ. &gt;&gt; But go through and look at the times he chose to go to somebody. &gt;&gt; There's a difference. There's a difference of what happens when he chooses to go to you. It's something special. Many people came to him and many of them went away. Yes. &gt;&gt; But when he chooses &gt;&gt; of his own choosing &gt;&gt; to come to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's what he's doing tonight &gt;&gt; of his own choosing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He comes down and says, "I'll take you. &gt;&gt; I'll take you. &gt;&gt; I see myself in you because before the foundation of the world, you were in him. Do you ever do you ever think of fathom that before the foundation of the world you were already in his mind &gt;&gt; before anything was created &gt;&gt; the plan of redemption was already in place. &gt;&gt; The plan to draw me to him. &gt;&gt; That there's an important part about that. There has to be a representation of him inside of you. For there ever to be a calling and a drawing from him to you, &gt;&gt; has to be a rep representation. He picked me up when I couldn't even look up. You know, there's there's times in in your life that you you go through trials and you go through struggles and things that that just seem so overbearing on you and you're just like, I I can't do it no more. You don't you don't know, you know, how you're going to take your next breath. Sometimes you you you feel so oppressed and you you feel like the just the weight of the world and and and I I don't you know you become so stressed and and Satan will will plant all these thoughts in your mind of of of of you know there's no reason for even you to to keep on going because you just don't you can't do anything. You know, brother brother Greley was saying last night he was talking about being nervous and he said just embrace that. He said, "I just I realized I just had to embrace it. Just embrace that." Well, I'm going to I'm going to offer this to you tonight. The next time that you you come to that place that you said, "I don't know what I can do. I don't know how I'm going to get out of this situation," go ahead and embrace that and recognize you aren't going to get yourself out of it. &gt;&gt; He's going to raise you up &gt;&gt; if you will yield to him. He's drawing you. &gt;&gt; He invites you to his table. &gt;&gt; Don't turn that away. &gt;&gt; When you when you you get to that place and you're like, I I I I've just got to give up. Well, that's what you need to do. Sometimes we get in the way of God moving. &gt;&gt; We we we try to figure it all out and we say, it's got to happen this way or this way or this way or it's no way. No, we need to let those things go and say, God, whatever your will is, &gt;&gt; that's what I want in my life. I And I just give it all to you. I I I I'm relying I can't rely on my strength in myself. I'm lame. &gt;&gt; And that's what you've got. You embrace that and say, "God, I don't know. You're you you're my Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; You're the only the only one that can provide for me &gt;&gt; is him. And he's the only one that can raise you up, that can lift you up. Jeremiah, would you stand with me, please? So, I'll I'll I'll note I need to be quiet. Jeremiah chapter 30 says, "For I will restore health unto thee, &gt;&gt; the Lord. &gt;&gt; I will heal thee of thy wounds, &gt;&gt; sayaeth the Lord, &gt;&gt; because they called thee an outcast." saying, "This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You might find yourself in a place that you think, "No, nobody cares about me. Nobody cares about the struggle that I'm going through. I' I feel like I've I've been considered an outcast. I've been ostracized." Yield to him. He can bring restoration. He will bring restoration. That's his desire. &gt;&gt; Uh the uh the book of Psalms is a is a very special very special book. I I would love if y'all would read with me the book of Psalm or just Psalm 23, chapter 23. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoth my soul. He leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord &gt;&gt; forever. &gt;&gt; Forever. Now you read those words. Make that your testimony tonight. I I I I kind of wonder maybe was David thinking of the the time with Mphibicheth whenever he he wrote some of those things. I don't know. I don't know exactly what was going on, but I in in my mind as I read over it and I think of the story, I I feel like that that maybe he could have been reflecting on on some of those things. one one more scripture and then I' I've asked brother Kate if he would sing a a song for us this evening as we as we close. And um this is the song that that was that was just burning in my heart this morning. But in in the in 2 Corinthians chapter 5:17 says, "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, &gt;&gt; how many are in Christ tonight? If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away, behold, all things are become new. Maybe this evening you feel like you're in the condition of Mphibicheth. Maybe you feel broken. Maybe you feel crippled or feel damaged or you feel defective. You feel separated or ostracized or any of those things. Something that's happened in the past. the things that was out of your control. We don't have to remain in that condition tonight. &gt;&gt; We can rest in the arms of God. We can rest in him in his strength &gt;&gt; as he carries you to his table. Brother Kate, would you sing? [Music] Wounded and forsaken. I was shattered by the fall. Broken and forgot. Feeling lost and all alone. Summoned by the key into the master's courtle lifted by the Savior and cradled in his arms. I was carried to the table. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Seated where I don't belong. [Music] carried to the table, swept away by his love. And I don't see my brokenness anymore. When I'm seated at the table of the Lord, I'm carried to the table. [Music] The table of the Lord. [Music] The fighting thoughts of fear. Wondering why he'd call my name. &gt;&gt; Never had those question. &gt;&gt; Am I good enough to share this cup? This world has left me lame. Even in my weak weakness, the Savior called my name. &gt;&gt; Can you hear him calling your name? &gt;&gt; And in his holy presence, &gt;&gt; oh, in his presence, &gt;&gt; I'm healed. &gt;&gt; We're healed and unshamed. Hallelujah. As I'm carrying to the table, [Music] &gt;&gt; sitting where I don't belong. I'm carrying to the table. Swept away by his love. &gt;&gt; And I don't see my brokenness anymore. As I'm seated at the table of the Lord, I'm carried to the table. &gt;&gt; Why don't you just let him &gt;&gt; lift you up this evening? He can lift you up out of your brokenness. I'm carrying to the table. &gt;&gt; He can lift you up out of your heartache. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. seated where I don't belong. &gt;&gt; He's the only one that has the strength to know. &gt;&gt; I'm carried to the table. Hallelujah. Swept away by his love. &gt;&gt; And I don't see my brokenness anymore. [Music] As I'm seated at the table of the Lord. Oh, carry to the table. The table of the Lord. A fighting thoughts of fear. wondering why he'd call my name. Am I good enough to share this cup? This world has left me lame. And even in my weakness, the Savior call my name. And in his holy presence, I'm here to shame. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As I'm carried to the table, [Music] I'm seated where I don't belong. Oh, carried to the table. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Swept away by his love. [Music] And I don't see my brokenness anymore as I'm seated at the table of the Lord. Oh, carry it to the table. [Music] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is rest in his strength this evening. &gt;&gt; Not in your own. Just rest and heal tonight. Let him carry you. I'll carry to the table. &gt;&gt; Let he'll heal you. Let him remove all of the barriers &gt;&gt; where I don't belong. &gt;&gt; All the things that's tied you down that you felt like it's been imposed tonight. &gt;&gt; Carry to the table. &gt;&gt; He can offer a full restoration. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] And I don't see my brokenness anymore as I'm seated at the table of the Lord. Oh, carry to the table. table of the Lord. I'm carried to the table. [Music] Seated where I don't belong. Oh, carried to the table. [Music] swept away by his love. [Music] And I don't see my brokenness anymore. As I'm seated at the table of the Lord, I'm carried to the table. [Music] the table of the Lord. I'm carried to the table. &gt;&gt; There's no place we'd rather be, Lord, tonight at your table. &gt;&gt; Table of the Lord. It's the atmosphere, Lord, that we were created to dwell in for eternity. Your presence. We recognize tonight that if we would have received what we deserved, it would have been death and hell. &gt;&gt; But you made a way. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. when we couldn't get to the table on our own strength, you made a way to get us there. We sometimes say, Lord, you you rigged this in our favor. Not only did you bring us to the table, but everything that you have required of us, you have provided for us. We really can't lose. We really can't lose if we stay in fellowship with you and we keep our legs under the table. There's so many stories in this room tonight, Lord, that can relate to this great Bible story from all angles. Some of us were dropped by people who truly loved us. They didn't disregard us intentionally. They just didn't have what we needed. They couldn't provide what they didn't possess. I'm convinced that this nurse had taken this little child as her as her own responsibility. And I'm convinced that she would have gladly taken his place in the fall. She cared for this child, but she didn't have the strength and ability to protect him in that moment of crisis. And he was changed forever. There are people in this room, Jesus, who were dropped by people like that, who loved us, but they had been dropped. And they had never healed. And they were still bleeding years later. And bleeding people bleed on people. Father, there is a bomb. There is a bomb in Gilead and we thank you for applying it right now as we prepare to leave this room. A Pharisee passed. A priest one after another passed. this broken, twisted, beaten body laying in the ditch. Finally, an an enemy, a Samaritan passed by and poured oil and wine in the broken man's wounds. Not only that, put him on his own animal, took him to the inn and paid his stay. Lord Jesus, would you pour in tonight as we leave the oil and the wine marri heal, restore? Tonight we have a choice what we what we will look at tonight, what we will look at tomorrow. Will we will we look at those broken feet under the table or will we be so thankful that you took us in our brokenness and you are still for many of us you're still healing us. We grow impatient but the process is divine. pour in right now. Somebody lift your faith. &gt;&gt; You may not be able to relate to this at all, but the one next to you may have come for a word like what you've heard. You heard two words tonight, and you may not have needed one or the other, but the reality is somebody here needed to hear again that it's all under the table. It's all under the blood. if you'll place it there and leave it there. Father, right now as faith lifts up in this room, we we ask you to draw to drive deep in our heart identity. &gt;&gt; We are no longer orphans. We are no longer rejected. We are no longer forsaken. We are no longer handicapped &gt;&gt; because you have called us and then carried us to your table. &gt;&gt; So we will not leave here tonight merely a product of our broken feet. But our identity is now new in Christ. And we leave here as hes of the king, trusting that you will heal every part of us that still stands in need. Jesus, you're real and your your heart is for us. If we could just see, you're for us. Bless those who have labored tonight in the word and those who have pulled in faith. bless the brief time of fellowship that we will have now and bless the food that has been prepared. May we have quick fellowship with one another and uh and and come back tomorrow for whatever you have for us. I feel your presence. My body says, "You're you're very tired." But my spirit says, "Lord, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you." Cuz I believe you put your finger on somebody's need here tonight. I praise you. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask this blessing. Isn't the Lord good? I don't know about you, but I get so tired of the same old same old. &gt;&gt; I like something a little different. &gt;&gt; I I like a variety. &gt;&gt; I've spent too many times, it's been years, but I've spent a lot of times at a smorges board. Not just because I wanted to eat so much, but I like a spoon of that and a little piece of that and just I love it sometime when we can have that in the in the spirit and we can have different needs and different ministries. If all were pastors, if all were evangelists, if all were apostles, if all were prophets, if all were teachers, he would be a an odd God. &gt;&gt; He's not four-fingered. He's five. &gt;&gt; Sing this as you leave. Go in peace. Benjamin, do you have any voice? I just want to sing this old chorus as we go out. A child of the king. I want everybody to leave here tonight. Don't go down there to that fellowship hall and and talk about who dropped you and who failed you and what ministry let you down. &gt;&gt; I'm going to run you off the property if I hear you cuz you're missing it. That's the one thing about our identity being changed &gt;&gt; is is sometimes we really don't know who we are anymore. &gt;&gt; So don't go down there and talk about preachers or peoples or stepmothers or whatever. You go down there knowing that by the blood, by his election, you're a child of the king. Amen. &gt;&gt; The reality is your wound is is as big to you as mine was to me. But I choose not to continue to look at it &gt;&gt; because Oh yes. Oh yes. Tomorrow night 7:00 I'm a child of the king. &gt;&gt; Oh his royal [Music] blood. It now &gt;&gt; it now flows in my veins. [Music] I I who was wrenched and poor now can say, "Oh, praise God. Praise God. I'm a child of the king." And oh yes and oh yes. Oh I'm a child of the king. Oh his royal blood. It now it now flows in my ve I who was rich and poor. Oh, I now can say, "Oh, praise God. Praise God. I'm the child of the King." Oh yes. And Oh yes, I'm a child of the King. Turn around and greet somebody. You're dismissed. He now flows in my veins. Fellowship is at the bottom [Music] and poor. Oh, I now can sing. Oh, praise God. Praise God. Oh, I'm a child of the King now. I am a child with a heavenly home. You see my holy father. He has made me his very own. I'm cleansed by his blood. Oh, and I'm clothed in his arms. You know, and someday I'll sing with all the angels above and Oh yes. Oh yes. I'm a child of the king. Oh, his royal blood now flows in my veins. And I I who was wretched and poor. Oh, I now can say, "Oh, praise God. Praise God. I'm a child of the king. [Music]
