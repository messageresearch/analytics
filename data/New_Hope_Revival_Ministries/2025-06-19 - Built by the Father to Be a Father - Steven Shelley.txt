Before you can be the father you're called to be… you have to know the One who fathered you.
This word cuts through the noise and calls men back to the altar—back to strength, integrity, and spiritual authority.
A charge for godly fathers who won't back down, won't compromise, and won’t stop praying.

Let your roots go deep.
Stand your ground.
And believe for your family like never before.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
To be the father that you're called to be, you've got to learn to relate first and foremost to your heavenly father. And this is where things break down. In order to be a good father, you've got to know you have one. And you've got to understand that he's not out to destroy you. He's out to build you, to make you somebody, to make you something, to give you strength, to be everything that he has created and called you to be. A man who doesn't have a good relationship with his heavenly father will struggle in everyday fatherhood. The more you fall in love with your heavenly father, the more you learn to relate with your heavenly father and hear the heart of your heavenly father, the better father you'll be to your children. If a man will walk upright before the Lord with discretion in all of his affairs, it's the desire of the Lord to bless that man with favor. When we sense the favor of the Lord withdrawing from our lives, and I have on more than one occasion uh during my life, when we sense his favor withdrawing from us, that's not the time to get bitter. That's not the time to get cold and indifferent. That's the time to go to the altar. In fact, that's the time to be chained to the altar, grabbing a hold of the horns of the altar and saying, "Lord, I won't be moved until you show me what it is in my life that's caused your favor to withdraw." I want you to know the love of the Lord will never leave you. But the favor and the blessing of the Lord will leave you high and dry if you're not walking in his ways and his commandments. If a man's ways please the Lord, he he's not only to bless and provide, able to do that, but he's also able to make his own enemies be at peace with him. That's the goodness of God. I'm thankful for it. Godly fathers in this hour are like lighthouse towers, rooted in the word. They've already weathered their own personal storms. They have found themselves a place of being steadfast, unmovable in their faith. They're not looking for the trends and the newer ways, but their roots go down deeper. The more the winds blow, the more the adversaries come, the deeper their roots go down in their faith. They're not nearly as emotional as they get more mature. Their fears are fewer and farther between. because they're learning to put their whole trust and their whole hope in the Lord. We want to acknowledge this morning every father in this house who prays for his children. And I don't mean a mambby pami lay me down prayer. I mean the kind that rattles the bars of hell and rings the bells of heaven. one that says, "I've got the faith of a bulldog, and I'm going to put my jaw down on the promise of God, and I'm going to believe for my children." How many of you have ever uh had to go before the Lord and say, "Wait a minute. Take your hands off of my family." This is not only a mother's duty, it is primarily the duty of a father. You back up, you foul spirit. I won't have it because somebody else agrees with it. I won't have it because somebody else accepts it. I'm going to stand on the word and believe that God will drive back the forces of hell. The devil better take his hands off of my children, my family, my grandchildren. Come on. I'm telling you, we can do some business in the spirit. Let me tell you something. Dads aren't going to be perfect. I don't know any I don't know any I don't know any perfect children. So that's good. They're not going to be perfect. They're not always going to get it right. But if they are there for you, that's something to celebrate. If they won't compromise with your sin, that's something to celebrate. If they'll tell you the truth instead of what you want to hear, that's something to celebrate.
