Description:
We have so many reasons to be thankful - from the nation that we live in and the freedoms we enjoy, to the salvation and complete redemption the Lord Jesus has purchased on our behalf. Certainly, many of us have situations in our life that our less than ideal, but we serve a faithful God Who has promised to provide for every need in our lives - we need only to give thanks.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the Bible says in Psalm 100 make a joyful noise unto the Lord all ye lands serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto Him and bless his name for the Lord is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations what a timeless song the psalmist sung to the Lord and it is recorded for you and I it's a psalm that I go back to many times in my life not just when I'm entering into the house of the Lord but when I'm approaching God in prayer in my private devotion I want to always come in giving thanks I want to talk to you for just a few minutes today about giving thanks we're entering into the holiday season and that means so many different things for different people from Thanksgiving all the way to Hanukkah Christmas the new year it seems to be a period of a couple of months where people are getting together fellowshipping with family enjoying good food I want to encourage you don't leave the Lord out of your festivities take every opportunity that you can to be grateful I believe maybe it's a cliche that's being worn out a little bit in some circles but I believe that an added of gratitude determines your altitude I want to share with you a portion of Scripture that is a scripture often used to describe the end times it's in 2nd Timothy chapter 3 and verse 1 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come that word perilous is fierce hard difficult times for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful which means ungrateful unholy which means opposing that which is sacred or having no reverence without natural affection which means hard-hearted unfeeling without regard for others trucebreakers false accusers incontinent which means having no self-control driven by appetites and passions fierce which means savage or brutal traitors heavy which means reckless rash headstrong high-minded which means conceited or puffed up lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away this is the Apostle Paul speaking to his spiritual son Timothy he is describing some dark spirits that will show up in the end time we have every reason to believe when we examine these verses of Scripture that Paul was not just speaking to Timothy about the atmosphere of the world in the end time but he was also describing spirits that would be launched against the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ some of these conditions or attributes that we just read to you are present in our churches around the world today fierce conceited heady highminded disrespectful or disobedient to parents on how having no reverence for God are the things of God but I find it's so amazing that tucked in all of those very serious problems is the word unthankful right in the midst of violence right in the midst of not having natural affection is unthankful it seems that we're living in a generation of ingratitude we take for granted so many of the blessings that we enjoy in our lives I live in the United States of America I don't know where you're watching this but in our nation we have lots of problems but we are so blessed to have the freedoms that we have to worship God according to the dictator of our heart and by the leadership of the Holy Spirit and I want to take time to be thankful to be grateful to God we have the opportunity in America that if we work hard we can earn enough money in most cases to pay our bills and have a pretty good life if that's what we choose but it's not just to America we owe our gratitude ultimately it's to God our Creator our Savior the one who cares so much for us if this is indeed a generation of ingratitude we need to know what that word means it means having a lack of proper appreciation it means not having enough thanks for something that you have received what it really means is that we are not valuing the blessings like we should we take our breath our health our strength the blessing on our home and family we take it for granted and Paul was warning his spiritual son Timothy that one of those dark spirits that would show up in the end time to rob the church of its power leaving the church with a structure of godliness a form of godliness we often say the right things but stripping the church of its real power I believe there is power in being thankful I believe there is power in praise I believe that one of the ways that we demonstrate our faith is when we are appraiser there are only two kinds of people in the world after all complainers and Prazeres I'd like to ask you the question which are you you say that's getting a little personal well I'm asking myself the same question in fact I'm making a list of the things that I need to be more thankful for we always have those items that are high on the list that we most often thank the Lord for but I made a list of things that I take for granted every single day of my life and I want to take some special time to stop and say Lord I want to thank you for what you are providing for me and I want to take an opportunity to stop looking over the blessings and give you praise in all things when we look at this we wonder is is being unthankful as serious as perhaps not having natural affection or being heady conceded high-minded well according to the Apostle it's right there in the list we don't know for sure that Paul was listing these attributes of sin of the spiritual environment and condition of the end time if he was listing them in the order of their importance but we have to remember how the Apostles and the patriarchs wrote the scripture the Bible tells us they did it as they were moved upon by the Holy Spirit the Spirit of Truth some of the writers used to scribe they spoke under inspiration of the Holy Spirit and a scribe would write it down perhaps the Apostle Paul did his own writing because many of the epistles were written from prison where he was all alone in solitary confinement suffering and yet writing some of the most precious truths that we have in the entire Bible we don't know if Paul was making the list by putting first the things that were most important but what we do know is as the Spirit of God would bring one of these conditions or attributes to his mind he would write it down when I look at the list I notice that he has listed unthankful above unholy that word unholy remember it means opposing God are not showing a proper respect or reverence to the things of God the Bible tells us that having this sense of the holy and of holiness is vitally important in Hebrews 12 verse 14 follow with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord so if the scripture is clear to tell us that without holiness we will not be able to see the Lord and if being unthankful is even listed above unholy I wonder what the judgment is I wonder what happens to those who cooperate with that spirit of ingratitude I challenge you today to move against that spirit in your life take more time to be thankful I'm not talking about just being cheesy I'm not talking about just words coming out of your mouth I'm talking about a lifestyle now in America we celebrate the holiday of Thanksgiving we think about the founding of America we think about the Pilgrims and the Indians etc but the truth is if they were celebrating something it's very likely that they were celebrating the Feast of Tabernacles because those early Puritans who came from Europe they understood the importance of remembering the Feast of the Bible but they had so much to be thankful for many years later our president declared and made a day of Thanksgiving as a national holiday a prophet brother branham from the last generation called it the only Christian holiday because it's one that is totally geared to giving God thanks now I know today that most people think of it more as turkey day but I want you to know it's much much more than a fine meal because a lot of us are blessed to enjoy fine food every day of the year it's a time to be grateful to express our thanks to God not only for the turkey and trimmings but for every good blessing every good and perfect gift that cometh down from above from the father of life I believe there is a strong trend to live a life of ingratitude and in order to break that cycle we're going to have to be praisers and not complainers we're warned in verse 5 that from such such as display these attributes we should turn away because it's a very serious thing to come under the the influence of any of these individual spirits and sometimes people who are under the influence of something negative or dark they come into agreement it seems like with something that's going on bad in someone else's life and sort of a coalition is formed and we have to be careful that we that we don't come under the influence of someone however none of us can take the moral high road in this situation because every one of us can certainly look at our lives and identify areas where we have just failed to take appropriate time to praise God to thank God to be grateful to God for all of his many blessings so I'm not going to focus on pulling myself away right now I'm gonna focus on asking the Lord to give me help grace to find those areas that I have never taken the moment to be thankful for and given him praise for and do it now it's not always convenient giving thanks are giving praise is not always convenient and it's not always based on our present circumstances the same apostle said in 1st Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 18 in the amplified bible thank God in everything no matter what the circumstances may be be thankful and give thanks for this is will of God for you who are in Christ Jesus the revealer and the mediator of that will being thankful is not a natural state of mind for most people it it takes a choice we make a choice to reflect on the good things in our life and we make a choice to give God praise what I find out is being thankful is often the product of maybe having lack maybe doing without something in your life and all of a sudden you began to see a change in that area and when you know what it means to have nothing and now you have something when you have been sick and now you're enjoying health or healing it gives you that motivation that you need to give God praise knowing what it feels like to be broke to have nothing will cause a person to be more grateful when they begin to have prosperity and blessing in their life when you're facing death the uncertainty of disease and all of a sudden there's a breakthrough oh my you're going to want to be thankful you're gonna want to be appraiser I want you to know that giving thanks and being appraiser is costly again it's usually because someone has been through a trial like Paul and Silas in the book of Acts beaten bleeding bruised but in the midnight hour they chose not to focus on their wounds but to focus on the one who had given them eternal life the Bible tells us in Ephesians 5:20 giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ everything every good day every pay raise every good doctor report every help every encouragement every big and little thing that blesses our life we an opportunity to give God praise and to be thankful for I want to share one more little portion with you today and it's found in the book of Habakkuk and it's in chapter 3 verse 17 through verse 19 the best way if you're looking for the book of Habakkuk in your Bible is if you can find the book of Mathew which is the first book of the New Testament you just turn left and go back five books and you will have found a little small book of Habakkuk the Prophet that word our name Habakkuk means one who embraces or clings it can mean a wrestler I want you to listen at these verses although the fig tree shall not blossom neither shall fruit be in the vines the labor of the olives shall fail and the fields shall yield no meat the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there shall be no herd in the stalls verse 18 yet I will rejoice in the Lord I will joy in the God of my salvation the Lord God is my strength and he will make my feet like Hinds feet and he will make me to walk upon mine high places I absolutely love these verses of Scripture Habakkuk sprays his glorifying of the Lord his expression of thanks was not based on his present circumstances he was resting his faith on the character of God and that character of God is unchanging our circumstances will change our feelings will change but our God and his care after his sovereignty his faithfulness his love for his children it will never change and it caused Ibaka to have a sense of gratitude that was not affected by what was going on or what was to come Habakkuk was a prophet and he was given vision and instruction of a terrible captivity that was coming on God's people they were going into bondage and they were going to suffer yet again in fact Habakkuk saw the seriousness of that condition and he summarized it by saying the figs are not blossoming and the fruit on the vines and trees have failed to materialise and the olive trees are not giving any olives so there will be no oil the fields are barren and there's no produce for us to take and to feed our families the flocks have been cut off from the fold yet I will praise the Lord I will glory in the God of my salvation and come on that is giving thanks that is living in an attitude of gratitude matthew henry a great commentator of the scripture when he would give commentary on places in the scripture where someone was ignoring their circumstances and giving God praise yet or in the South we say anyhow anyways he called it joy he said that is not happiness that is joy and he said joy isn't a byproduct of an easy life it is a response to God's never changing character when our circumstances are changing even when they don't change immediately after prayer joy remains when we keep our hearts aligned with God and his faithfulness to us Habakkuk said all of these terrible things are going to surround us and yet I will give God praise because he is my strength and he will make my feet like Hinds feet Bible commentators believe that this word hind is referring to either a female deer or also describing a female mountain goat I've been in an Getty in Israel and I've watched these ibex these mountain goats I've watched them scale right up the side of a cliff and you're wondering in your mind how in the world are they holding on Hinds feet is an expression that's used to describe that little animals ability to place his hind feet the last two feet in exactly the same position that he has placed his front two feet what he's doing is he is cutting his unsure 'ti of his next step in half he knows that if this spot will support his front feet it will also support his back feet and so instead of making four different footsteps or footprints he takes those back feet and places them right in the sure fought sure-footed spot that he has chosen for the front feet and because of that he is able to climb in unbelievable circumstances I love what habakkuk acid surrounded by difficulty and what and lack and famine yet I will praise the Lord he will give me the Hinds feet so that no matter what the mountain is I'll be able to climb it if I keep my eyes on him this ability of behind enabled her to run swiftly up the rocky terrain to escape approaching predators very sure-footed I believe that those who demonstrate their Thanksgiving their gratitude to God with their praise I believe if we continue in a lifestyle of thanks living and not just Thanksgiving but it becomes a lifestyle I believe that no matter what surrounds us we can be sure footed in these unsettled and unsure times God doesn't always change your circumstances immediately when you pray and that can be so discouraging and so challenging sometimes our heartaches and our pains our griefs are still there but I want you to know that often the strength that we need is found in simply walking on pressing on depending on him and giving him praise in spite of what we feel what we see or what we are experiencing I guess I want to say to you today that disappointment does not necessarily have to lead you into despair we're going to be disappointed things are not always going to turn out the way that we would like for them to turn out maybe you plan for a special event and then something comes up at the last minute that spoils our sours a portion of that event and you're so disappointed but I will you know you can't let the disappointment get the best of you and push you into despair because no matter what we serve a great big God who deserves our praise who's worthy of our praise there's a little song that says give thanks with a grateful heart give thanks to the Holy One give thanks because he's given Jesus Christ his son and now let the weak say I am strong let the poor say I am rich because of what the Lord has done for us give thanks I want to leave that with you I didn't plan to sing it but I want to leave those words with you today thank you for spending this time with me my heart is overflowing I have circumstances in my life right now that are less than ideal but I have a God who's with me every step of the way god bless you give thanks you
