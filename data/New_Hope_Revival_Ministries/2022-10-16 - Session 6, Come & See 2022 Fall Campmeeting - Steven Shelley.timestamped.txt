[47:16] vacation
[47:18] but the Lord said it's better than 12
[47:20] hours of sleep
[47:22] two seconds
[47:25] resting in the glory of the Lord

[51:27] and that God was sending a Revival I
[51:30] believe it's yet to come
[51:31] but that God was sinning a Revival I was
[51:34] riding in the back of an Amish buggy
[51:37] and I shared this with brother Levi
[51:39] Fisher before he went home to be with
[51:41] the Lord I was riding in an Amish buggy
[51:44] and I had in my hand a book of brother
[51:47] Branham a spoken word book and God
[51:49] showed me in that experience that there
[51:52] would be a Revival among the people I
[51:54] didn't know these people existed and
[51:57] that's exactly what they're contending
[51:58] for is that God will reach the peoples
[52:03] the families where they have come from
[52:05] and so when I'm among them when they're
[52:08] with us I am at real peace because to me
[52:12] they represent something that is yet to
[52:15] come and it must come quickly because
[52:18] he's coming
[52:23] God bless you all
[52:25] it's a privilege to be here now we just
[52:29] really enjoyed this weekend and
[52:31] and uh
[52:33] the anointing was so strong I was just
[52:36] thinking well I kind of hope West just
[52:37] keeps it going like that we don't have
[52:39] the same this morning but I had failed
[52:41] earlier that I should let him know that
[52:42] we can so
[52:44] uh we're willing to if we should
[52:46] now I felt like we should first of all
[52:49] uh
[52:51] sing maybe one person a course of a
[52:54] German song for freda's sake
[52:57] so we'll do that and then then we have
[52:59] another song that it's really a good
[53:01] song that uh
[53:02] I hope you can hear the words and listen
[53:04] closely it's a good song
[53:06] [Music]

[1:25:59] and we don't have a whole lot of voice
[1:26:02] but it's
[1:26:03] pretty good right this second
[1:26:06] it won't sound nice it'll be a little
[1:26:08] Gravelly I I thought his brother Greely
[1:26:10] was singing
[1:26:11] with their voices clear and strong
[1:26:15] and all of our voices cracking in here
[1:26:18] that's going to be another benefit of
[1:26:20] Eternity we can sing all the time and
[1:26:23] never get hoarse
[1:26:24] I would rather uh know that I had over
[1:26:29] praised over sung over shouted over
[1:26:32] preached over amen
[1:26:35] then over cheered at some old football
[1:26:37] game
[1:26:40] if I was going to lose my voice I'd
[1:26:42] rather lose it for the King of Kings and
[1:26:45] the Lord of lords they tell me there was
[1:26:47] a man a visitor here last night his wife
[1:26:50] had asked me the night before to pray
[1:26:52] that he would come she said I'm going to
[1:26:54] have to drag him
[1:26:56] and and I thought well my he must not be
[1:26:58] a church-going man well that wasn't it
[1:27:01] yesterday
[1:27:02] Alabama was playing Tennessee
[1:27:08] and he was an Alabama fan
[1:27:10] and so he came
[1:27:14] he had his Bible on his lap and his
[1:27:17] phone propped up beside it
[1:27:24] about about that's exactly what I said
[1:27:26] sister Joyce I said at least he was here
[1:27:31] I said now none of the home folk better
[1:27:33] try that
[1:27:36] but he was a visitor and I said at least
[1:27:39] he was here
[1:27:41] and in the presence I mean that I mean
[1:27:44] that but all about halfway through the
[1:27:46] services
[1:27:47] [Music]
[1:27:52] because Alabama who's not used to losing
[1:27:55] lost
[1:27:57] and you could have probably heard all
[1:27:58] the people at Happy Valley shouting
[1:28:00] because they're big Tennessee fans you
[1:28:03] could have probably heard them all the
[1:28:05] way down here because they finally beat
[1:28:08] Alabama
[1:28:09] you know what I could care less
[1:28:14] there's only one one tide I want to get
[1:28:17] rolled over and
[1:28:18] that's the pressures of this life we
[1:28:21] used to sing he'll roll me over the
[1:28:23] tides
[1:28:24] and uh but anyway I thought that was
[1:28:26] outstanding and brother brother Gary
[1:28:28] that was that was because of you that
[1:28:30] was that was because of your invitation
[1:28:33] and I appreciate that very very much
[1:28:36] that you invited that lady to come and
[1:28:39] she brought a group of people with her
[1:28:40] because of your invitation
[1:28:43] and there was a sister there who as we
[1:28:46] got to the handicapped part of the
[1:28:48] service she stood there in that aisle
[1:28:50] the entire time
[1:28:52] supporting me for preaching and maybe
[1:28:56] they don't understand what we understand
[1:28:58] or or know some of the things we know
[1:29:01] they may know something we need to know
[1:29:03] but we certainly know something they
[1:29:05] need to know
[1:29:07] but this is where they belong to be
[1:29:09] this is where they ought to be able to
[1:29:11] come and receive from the Lord
[1:29:14] and I don't ever want this to be a house
[1:29:17] where people cannot come and receive you
[1:29:20] know if this message is what we think it
[1:29:23] is and what we believe it is then we
[1:29:26] want everybody to have an opportunity to
[1:29:28] experience the reality of it and the
[1:29:31] reality of this message is the
[1:29:33] revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:29:36] I want to say to this body of Believers
[1:29:38] before we read the word you are so
[1:29:40] gracious thank you so much that you have
[1:29:43] always allowed it to be that kind of an
[1:29:45] atmosphere where people could come and
[1:29:48] visit and be blessed and go home and
[1:29:51] maybe we never see them again but we
[1:29:53] have a little part in their Journey
[1:29:55] everybody's not the bride of Christ
[1:30:00] everybody's not a part of the Bride
[1:30:03] everybody that's in the Bride is a part
[1:30:05] of the church but everybody that's in
[1:30:08] the church is not a part of the Bride I
[1:30:10] believe that your amen should be a
[1:30:12] little stronger than that
[1:30:14] and so we know that one of these days
[1:30:16] we're going to spend eternity not only
[1:30:19] with those who overcome the spirit of
[1:30:21] the age
[1:30:22] but also those who go into dark
[1:30:25] tribulation and who give their lives for
[1:30:28] the cause of Christ and they're going to
[1:30:30] be those who lay their head on a
[1:30:32] chopping block and have it cut off in
[1:30:34] Great Tribulation time because they will
[1:30:37] not deny the Saving Grace of the Lord
[1:30:40] Jesus Christ there's only one group of
[1:30:42] people going in the rapture and it's
[1:30:45] those that have the oil
[1:30:48] it's those that have the oil that I
[1:30:50] didn't say that
[1:30:57] say that Isaiah 40 28 has not thou hast
[1:31:00] thou not known hast thou not heard that
[1:31:04] the Everlasting God the Lord the creator
[1:31:07] of the ends of the Earth faith not
[1:31:10] neither is weary
[1:31:13] there is no searching of his
[1:31:15] understanding he giveth power how many
[1:31:19] of you have been a benefactor of this
[1:31:21] I've been a beneficiary of this he
[1:31:24] giveth power to the faint
[1:31:26] and to them that have no might he does
[1:31:29] what
[1:31:31] he increases their strength haven't you
[1:31:35] been at the end of your strength and he
[1:31:38] breathed on you just a little more to
[1:31:41] get you a little higher up
[1:31:43] oh Hallelujah
[1:31:45] and and this is so true
[1:31:48] it's not just those of us north of 50.
[1:31:52] but even though south of 50 are fainting
[1:31:55] and getting weary around us and young
[1:31:58] men utterly falling around us but listen
[1:32:02] to what the Lord says
[1:32:04] but they that
[1:32:10] they that
[1:32:12] wait
[1:32:14] upon the Lord
[1:32:16] shall do what
[1:32:19] renew their strength they shall
[1:32:27] I want you to understand I know you're
[1:32:29] standing but I want you to understand
[1:32:30] that word now
[1:32:32] that doesn't mean beat and flap their
[1:32:34] wings until they get lifted
[1:32:37] that means they set their wing oh my
[1:32:41] God it means that do you know what it's
[1:32:43] dangerous to Hold Your Arms out like
[1:32:45] that
[1:32:46] when I do that sometime in worship or
[1:32:49] when I'm just then it's like I can feel
[1:32:51] that upward pull
[1:32:54] I'm not living by feeling but I don't
[1:32:56] mind the feel I'll tell you right now I
[1:32:58] don't mind to feel the presence of the
[1:33:00] Lord
[1:33:01] some were testifying of things they felt
[1:33:03] supernaturally in the service last night
[1:33:06] and I want to hear it all
[1:33:08] because I honor God for letting us feel
[1:33:11] anything
[1:33:12] but that's not beating your wings until
[1:33:14] you care you can't hardly go it's just
[1:33:16] finding the wind and the current of the
[1:33:19] spirit and the way the spirit that's
[1:33:21] what so many of us have gotten off
[1:33:23] course is because we forgot that it's
[1:33:26] important to catch what the spirit is
[1:33:28] doing
[1:33:30] and then we just set our wings we just
[1:33:32] Mount our wings and we just um
[1:33:36] how many of you understand the
[1:33:37] difference in flying
[1:33:39] and mounting your wings they shall Mount
[1:33:42] up with wings
[1:33:44] as Eagles
[1:33:46] they shall run
[1:33:48] and not
[1:33:51] be weary they shall
[1:33:53] walk and not faint
[1:33:55] may God add his Blessing to the reading
[1:33:58] of his word you may be seated I want to
[1:34:00] ask you this morning are there any
[1:34:02] Eagles here
[1:34:05] I know there are because I heard a group
[1:34:08] of eagles singing I am an overcomer
[1:34:11] and that's what Eagles do they come over
[1:34:15] they get above their circumstances they
[1:34:18] get above their trials they get above
[1:34:21] their pains and aches they get rid of
[1:34:24] their frogs
[1:34:26] that's what Overcomers do they put their
[1:34:29] crippled feet under the Masters table
[1:34:31] and they drink the water and eat the
[1:34:34] bread of the King of Kings and the Lord
[1:34:36] of lords
[1:34:38] it doesn't mean that we don't get weary
[1:34:40] it doesn't mean that we don't get
[1:34:42] discouraged it doesn't mean that we
[1:34:44] don't fight anxiety or depression or
[1:34:47] sickness or disease
[1:34:49] it doesn't mean that we don't get tired
[1:34:51] of the fight
[1:34:52] but what it does mean is in that moment
[1:34:55] when we feel so weary and we have come
[1:34:58] to the end of our strength we have
[1:35:00] learned that there is a source
[1:35:04] that we can tap into
[1:35:07] and we can live from his life
[1:35:11] or you're listening
[1:35:12] we can live from his life
[1:35:16] he is the Divine Source in this hour of
[1:35:20] our life because we died
[1:35:24] how many of you know we died our life
[1:35:27] came to an end our life's source and
[1:35:30] strength is finished in the natural
[1:35:33] the Bible tells us that the life that we
[1:35:36] now live is not our Natural Born life
[1:35:41] it's another kind of life
[1:35:43] it's of a Zoe life it's of an eternal
[1:35:46] life that will never pass away if you
[1:35:50] believe that same man
[1:35:51] am I screaming too loud at you
[1:35:54] I know it doesn't sound real good
[1:35:57] in the Amplified Bible
[1:35:59] and I often get asked about the
[1:36:01] Amplified Bible because I understand
[1:36:03] that Believers of this message are are
[1:36:06] King James version only
[1:36:09] and I am too pretty much there are some
[1:36:13] versions that I stay far away from
[1:36:16] but I use the Amplified Bible on
[1:36:18] occasion with my King James because
[1:36:21] sometimes it amplifies the verse
[1:36:26] and I needed some time to get louder
[1:36:30] because I need to understand it because
[1:36:32] it's my life source
[1:36:34] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:36:37] you
[1:36:38] this is where our real life comes from
[1:36:42] and uh I like the way it reads it says
[1:36:44] but those who wait for the Lord
[1:36:48] who expect
[1:36:50] who look for and hope in him shall
[1:36:56] change
[1:36:57] and renew their strength and power how
[1:37:03] many of you'd like to have your strength
[1:37:05] and power renewed
[1:37:08] they renew their strength and power they
[1:37:12] shall lift their wings that's all you do
[1:37:18] it's not a bunch of this
[1:37:21] is what we did in Pentecost
[1:37:24] this is what we did in holiness
[1:37:28] some of us came out of those backgrounds
[1:37:30] and we were like we mentioned last night
[1:37:32] we were all the time trying to beat our
[1:37:34] wings
[1:37:36] working so hard swimming so much trying
[1:37:40] to please all the different ideas
[1:37:43] that people had
[1:37:45] I've told you before that they they
[1:37:48] would come through and I was a boy and
[1:37:51] they would preach their Revelation their
[1:37:53] idea their conviction
[1:37:56] and you could never keep up with it
[1:37:59] you you every preacher that came through
[1:38:01] you had to beat your wings a little
[1:38:03] harder to try to please them
[1:38:06] come on I was a pleaser I wanted to be
[1:38:09] right with God
[1:38:11] and so if the preacher who's more
[1:38:13] spiritual than I am if he told me that I
[1:38:16] had to wear long sleeves all the time
[1:38:18] that's exactly what I wanted to do
[1:38:22] because I wanted to please God
[1:38:25] see
[1:38:26] there's nothing wrong with that
[1:38:27] sincerity
[1:38:28] but it's like the preacher that came
[1:38:30] through for my granny most of you know
[1:38:32] my grandmother was a pastor and when the
[1:38:35] message came she stepped down from from
[1:38:37] doing that but she was a pastor for many
[1:38:40] years wonderful wonderful woman of God
[1:38:44] she had an evangelist to come through in
[1:38:46] those years and he preached on Coca-Cola
[1:38:54] what a sin it was
[1:38:56] you may be here you may feel like it is
[1:38:59] and let me tell you something don't
[1:39:01] drink it
[1:39:05] to you it's a sin don't drink it
[1:39:09] you know I think I'll preach on
[1:39:10] Coca-Cola because I don't like it
[1:39:15] but now you better not say much about Dr
[1:39:18] Pepper
[1:39:23] foreign
[1:39:27] I like that burning in my throat that I
[1:39:30] get from a Dr Pepper
[1:39:31] have you all oh never mind
[1:39:36] he got up and he preached so hard about
[1:39:38] a Coca-Cola and Granny was pastoring two
[1:39:40] churches
[1:39:42] one of them was certain miles south of
[1:39:44] here on Highway 10 in in
[1:39:48] Blue Springs area of Alabama and she was
[1:39:52] working in the cotton mill
[1:39:55] and driving back and forth every night
[1:39:58] to preach I mean to take this preacher
[1:40:01] down to preach Revival and after the
[1:40:04] service she said I was so tired that I
[1:40:07] could hardly stand it and so I said to
[1:40:09] him brother I wouldn't offend you for
[1:40:11] nothing
[1:40:12] but she said I'm going to have to stop
[1:40:14] here at this little store and get a
[1:40:16] Coca-Cola or something she said I cannot
[1:40:18] stay awake and she said I've already
[1:40:21] veered off the road twice and she said
[1:40:23] I'll I'll try to find something
[1:40:26] that I can do to keep me awake maybe I
[1:40:29] could suck on a piece of candy or
[1:40:31] something and he said oh sister Shelly
[1:40:34] don't worry about that I'll take a
[1:40:36] Double Cola
[1:40:40] well did anybody remember Double Cola
[1:40:43] what four of us are we only four of us
[1:40:45] that old
[1:40:47] that was double caffeine
[1:40:50] that was double all the sugar that was
[1:40:53] double all the stuff that everybody
[1:40:54] thought was bad and here he had preached
[1:40:57] on Coca-Cola because of the name
[1:41:00] we got so tired
[1:41:03] they said a woman should wear a hat no
[1:41:06] she shouldn't wear a hat she should do
[1:41:08] this she she shouldn't do that she she
[1:41:11] oh my we got so tired of flapping our
[1:41:14] wings just trying to please the Lord and
[1:41:18] what we really ended up doing was trying
[1:41:20] to please man
[1:41:23] you don't have to help me preach I'll
[1:41:25] preach without you if I have to
[1:41:27] and that's not what God wanted us doing
[1:41:30] I believe in personal conviction I
[1:41:33] believe in standards and I believe in
[1:41:36] personal standards and I believe in
[1:41:39] corporate standards
[1:41:41] I believe if you want to be a part of a
[1:41:43] church you have an obligation
[1:41:46] to follow the standard of that church I
[1:41:49] believe that is just common sense
[1:41:51] if you work in a retailer and they tell
[1:41:54] you a certain way a certain color to
[1:41:56] wear you do that
[1:41:58] if you work for a corporation that says
[1:42:00] no no mustache no facial hair you shave
[1:42:04] it off
[1:42:05] and so if you want to be a part of a
[1:42:08] body you have an obligation to pay a
[1:42:10] price but don't think for one moment
[1:42:13] that that is going to bring you any
[1:42:15] closer to the Lord
[1:42:17] because these are things that God deals
[1:42:19] with people differently according to
[1:42:22] their station and status in life and
[1:42:24] according to their own sinful nature
[1:42:26] there are certain things that some
[1:42:28] people have to stay away from I always
[1:42:30] mention this and then I'm going to get
[1:42:31] off the subject but in the in the
[1:42:33] Pentecostal Revival that was going on in
[1:42:36] Brownsville
[1:42:37] and I only kept up with that because my
[1:42:40] grandmother had prayed many times for
[1:42:43] brother we called him out and killed
[1:42:45] Patrick but in that Revival he was going
[1:42:48] by the name John Kilpatrick but granny
[1:42:50] knew him as Alton and God was doing some
[1:42:53] wonderful things among those Pentecostal
[1:42:55] people those Assembly of God people and
[1:42:58] people were coming from everywhere and
[1:43:00] giving their heart to the Lord and I
[1:43:01] don't know about you but I'm about
[1:43:02] people getting saved I'm about that I
[1:43:06] want people to get saved and get filled
[1:43:08] with the spirit because then the spirit
[1:43:10] can lead you
[1:43:12] teach you all the truth you need to know
[1:43:15] so I was for that whatever God was doing
[1:43:18] but in the midst of that is that Revival
[1:43:20] maybe it was draining a little bit the
[1:43:22] youth pastor of that group he he came
[1:43:25] out with a message that went all over
[1:43:27] the the nation
[1:43:30] and he began to tell the people that he
[1:43:33] had become addicted to a pornography and
[1:43:38] to Filthy things on the internet and she
[1:43:41] wanted to repent and wanted to make that
[1:43:44] right and he said to his to his children
[1:43:47] he said to his church I told the church
[1:43:49] about telling his children he said it
[1:43:52] was the most humiliating thing I've ever
[1:43:54] done in my life I had to set my own
[1:43:57] children down and explain to them why we
[1:43:59] couldn't have the internet in our home
[1:44:02] yeah I had to tell them that it wasn't
[1:44:04] just because there was filth on it it's
[1:44:08] because daddy couldn't keep his eyes off
[1:44:10] the film
[1:44:13] I tell you that man made a bold
[1:44:16] statement that reverberated through the
[1:44:18] body
[1:44:19] and it needs to be made again
[1:44:22] he never said that that every person
[1:44:25] couldn't have it or shouldn't have it
[1:44:28] and I heard preachers that get excited
[1:44:30] about things and they'll get mad at
[1:44:32] Facebook and they'll decide that nobody
[1:44:35] ought to have it or they'll get mad
[1:44:36] because they can't keep their eyes off
[1:44:38] the field and so they they decide nobody
[1:44:41] should even have any access to the world
[1:44:43] out there well I want to tell you
[1:44:45] something it's not that way
[1:44:47] but if you find that you've got a
[1:44:50] problem you're the one who needs to make
[1:44:52] a stand in your life and in your home
[1:44:55] and say no more
[1:44:58] I'd rather be cut off from the rest of
[1:45:00] the world and know that I'm connected to
[1:45:02] the True Vine Jesus Christ then to let a
[1:45:05] little smut keep my spirit from soaring
[1:45:09] I wasn't made to pick around in the
[1:45:11] beggarly elements of this world I was
[1:45:14] made to soar as an overcomer and to
[1:45:17] cause others to come
[1:45:20] but you see you get a little little
[1:45:21] under a little inspiration and you want
[1:45:23] everybody to do just like you do and
[1:45:26] people get wounded and and offended and
[1:45:28] they get hurt and I've been one of those
[1:45:30] people
[1:45:31] you see I've been one of those who
[1:45:34] dropped somebody before
[1:45:36] and it's not a very good feeling
[1:45:38] when you realize that your action
[1:45:41] your words
[1:45:43] something you did cause somebody's feet
[1:45:46] to be crippled and it's time I didn't
[1:45:50] finish the other part of that but if you
[1:45:52] realize and recognize that you've been
[1:45:55] guilty of that then you need to make
[1:45:58] that right with God and if at all
[1:46:00] possible write with the person that you
[1:46:03] dropped it's the right thing to do why
[1:46:07] are you so quiet it's the right thing to
[1:46:09] do
[1:46:10] it's just the right thing to do now I
[1:46:13] want to go to second Samuel chapter 17.
[1:46:15] I didn't finish reading I didn't let me
[1:46:18] let me let me finish reading Isaiah 40
[1:46:20] 31.
[1:46:23] but those who wait for the Lord who
[1:46:25] expect look for and hope in him shall
[1:46:28] change and renew their strength and
[1:46:30] power they shall lift their wings and
[1:46:33] mount up close to God as Eagles Mount up
[1:46:36] to the sun they shall run and not be
[1:46:40] weary they shall walk in not faint or
[1:46:42] become tired we're going to become tired
[1:46:45] in the physical but we don't have to be
[1:46:47] tired and weary in the spiritual before
[1:46:51] I forget to mention it let me explain
[1:46:53] about this word wait a lot of people
[1:46:55] believe that waiting on the Lord is
[1:46:57] sitting to do nothing but I want you to
[1:47:00] know that word Wade in Hebrew and often
[1:47:03] in Greek when we find it in the New
[1:47:04] Testament it doesn't mean twiddling your
[1:47:07] thumbs or sitting on your hands it means
[1:47:10] humbly and quietly serving the lord
[1:47:13] while you are anticipating something
[1:47:16] from him
[1:47:19] you're not cutting yourself off from the
[1:47:22] rest of the body
[1:47:23] you're connected to the body but you're
[1:47:26] just humbly before the Lord serving
[1:47:29] serve others if you're not getting what
[1:47:32] you'd like to get from the Lord serve
[1:47:34] others
[1:47:35] are you with me
[1:47:37] and see if God won't help you he will
[1:47:40] amen
[1:47:41] did I offend you
[1:47:44] that I upset you about Double Cola
[1:47:47] are you are you ashamed of me because I
[1:47:49] drank a Dr Pepper why did you get so
[1:47:52] quiet
[1:47:55] oh some are apologizing
[1:47:59] second Samuel chapter 17 and verse 16. I
[1:48:03] would not want to sit where you're
[1:48:05] sitting and listen to this old raspy
[1:48:07] voice
[1:48:10] thank God I don't have to
[1:48:14] now therefore sin quickly and tell David
[1:48:17] saying Lodge not this night in the
[1:48:20] plains of the wilderness
[1:48:22] but speedily Passover lest the king be
[1:48:25] swallowed up and all the people that are
[1:48:27] with him
[1:48:28] and then in verse 22 it says then David
[1:48:31] arose and all the people that were with
[1:48:34] him and they passed over Jordan by the
[1:48:37] Morning Light their lack not one of them
[1:48:40] that was not gone over Jordan
[1:48:44] I don't have time this morning to to
[1:48:47] find for you the context
[1:48:49] of this verse but I will tell you that
[1:48:52] I'm lifting it slightly from its context
[1:48:56] there was indeed some who wanted to
[1:48:59] linger behind and kind of sneak around
[1:49:02] and not go over and they thought they
[1:49:05] had a better strategy and there were
[1:49:08] some things that transpired but
[1:49:10] nonetheless verse 22 tells us that as
[1:49:13] the as the morning was coming up there
[1:49:16] was not one of them that didn't get over
[1:49:18] Jordan I want to encourage you tonight
[1:49:21] uh today it's time to get over it's time
[1:49:25] to cross over it's time to make a
[1:49:28] decision that we will not Lodge one more
[1:49:33] night in the wilderness
[1:49:36] we've already decided we don't need
[1:49:38] another night with the frogs now we're
[1:49:41] deciding that we will not Lodge one
[1:49:45] extra night in the wilderness but that
[1:49:48] we will find our way back to our source
[1:49:52] we will find the rock on which we were
[1:49:55] born
[1:49:57] we will find our way to Victory and we
[1:50:01] will not play with our soul
[1:50:05] we won't gamble with our life

[1:52:24] they're too Pentecostal
[1:52:26] [Music]
[1:52:28] we can't focus on what the buzzards are
[1:52:31] saying we can't focus on what the crows
[1:52:35] are saying we're following our chief

[1:52:57] our leader our chief he knows the way so
[1:53:01] don't get your eyes on what they're
[1:53:03] saying oh we're getting so many streams
[1:53:06] they're watching this meeting they're
[1:53:09] watching to see who's moving and who's
[1:53:11] not moving who's talking in tongues and
[1:53:14] who's not talking in tongues you know
[1:53:17] what it doesn't matter to me
[1:53:20] that has been following me for many many
[1:53:23] many many many many years
[1:53:26] I want to thank God for the internet
[1:53:27] yeah
[1:53:29] yeah I want to thank him for it I want
[1:53:31] to thank him for it now listen let me
[1:53:34] tell you this I just feel like we're
[1:53:36] having a chat probably because I'm
[1:53:37] sitting down
[1:53:39] but uh my grandmother was a prophetic
[1:53:42] woman
[1:53:43] and the the television was about to
[1:53:46] break
[1:53:48] and the Holiness people were very much
[1:53:50] against the thought of the television
[1:53:51] and I don't blame them
[1:53:53] because they were already preaching
[1:53:55] about going to the movies now all the
[1:53:57] churches go to the movies but in those
[1:53:59] days people didn't go to the public
[1:54:01] places of entertainment
[1:54:03] and uh and God blessed them for being
[1:54:06] separated from the things of the world
[1:54:08] now our little children know the names
[1:54:10] of movie stars and and pop stars that
[1:54:13] they ought not to even know who they are
[1:54:14] and that's our fault a lot of our our
[1:54:17] faults for for you know exposing them to
[1:54:20] those kinds of things but the church uh
[1:54:22] was very strong and they knew that that
[1:54:25] people were going to begin to buy these
[1:54:27] televisions and and they didn't start in
[1:54:29] every home they started in a
[1:54:31] neighborhood one family with a little
[1:54:33] more means than the rest would buy a
[1:54:35] television and everybody would go over
[1:54:37] there to watch something and I don't
[1:54:40] think it was much
[1:54:41] the screen was about that big
[1:54:44] the television set was about this big
[1:54:47] but the screen was about this big and
[1:54:50] the screen sat way up in the unit so
[1:54:53] it's like you were looking through a
[1:54:54] tunnel to see anything and the preachers
[1:54:57] were calling them one-eyed Devils that's
[1:55:00] what they are
[1:55:02] and they were calling them televisions
[1:55:05] and that's what they are because they
[1:55:08] have piped a lot of Filth into people's
[1:55:10] homes and lives and caused people to buy
[1:55:13] and do and things they would never do
[1:55:15] before and that's the truth you you can
[1:55:18] you don't have to say Amen or nothing
[1:55:19] it's it's nothing but the truth but
[1:55:22] everybody was so far against it and one
[1:55:24] night my grandmother was sitting on the
[1:55:26] side of the church and the spirit of the
[1:55:29] Lord fell on her and she began to
[1:55:31] prophesy
[1:55:33] and out of her mouth came this prophecy
[1:55:36] that a great evil was coming
[1:55:38] and that this device was going to fill
[1:55:41] the homes eventually with all kinds of
[1:55:45] Filth and and all kinds of worldly
[1:55:47] things but the spirit of the Lord said
[1:55:49] through her do not despair
[1:55:52] for I will also use
[1:55:56] that device to take the gospel
[1:56:02] to the outer reaches of this world
[1:56:06] and those who would never have a chance
[1:56:09] to hear the gospel any other way
[1:56:13] will hear it be because of this so let
[1:56:16] your position be
[1:56:19] that it can be used as evil as it is it
[1:56:24] can be used for the glory of God
[1:56:27] and that settled the issue for those
[1:56:29] people they didn't buy them for their
[1:56:31] homes
[1:56:32] they had the gospel but instead of
[1:56:35] fighting that they realize that it was
[1:56:38] going to happen whether they liked it or
[1:56:40] not why not God use it for his glory
[1:56:43] that's how I feel about the internet
[1:56:45] it's full of film the worst kinds of
[1:56:47] film some felt that's so bad you've got
[1:56:51] to be you've got to be extremely
[1:56:53] creative they tell me to even find it
[1:56:55] there's a whole black web and the whole
[1:56:57] Black Market out there where people buy
[1:57:00] one by people they sell and traffic
[1:57:03] people
[1:57:05] how hideous it is but I want to say I'm
[1:57:09] so thankful that it is in our world
[1:57:12] today because it's being used to take
[1:57:15] the truth to places where the truth
[1:57:19] needs to go
[1:57:22] and just remember somebody said well I
[1:57:25] don't know if God would even be let me
[1:57:27] tell you something God is for the gospel
[1:57:29] going everywhere
[1:57:31] and here's the thing for years they
[1:57:33] tried to hide some of what was going on
[1:57:34] down here in Alabama
[1:57:37] come on they didn't want to talk about
[1:57:38] it but now because of the internet
[1:57:41] everybody who wants to be a part of
[1:57:44] these meetings was able to join and they
[1:57:48] didn't even have to put their name down
[1:57:51] so we just say God bless the spies
[1:57:55] we just love you because you had to come
[1:57:58] and see for yourself
[1:58:00] and that's the way the truth reaches out
[1:58:04] and there are people sitting here right
[1:58:06] now because of an app
[1:58:09] because of a Facebook stream because of
[1:58:13] a YouTube stream and I I want you to
[1:58:16] know I stream Ministries I listen to
[1:58:19] preaching I watch preaching on Youtube
[1:58:21] and I'm thankful to be able to receive a
[1:58:24] little cross-pollination because it's
[1:58:26] not only what God is doing here for his
[1:58:28] people it's what God's doing everywhere
[1:58:31] that interests me I want to get a little
[1:58:34] bit of everything that God is doing how
[1:58:36] many of you feel that way
[1:58:38] I want to tell you something Eagles are
[1:58:41] High Flyers
[1:58:43] they soar higher than any other bird 10
[1:58:47] 000 feet they can fly now you know the
[1:58:50] average Jets at thirty thousand feet
[1:58:54] so they're just twenty thousand feet
[1:58:56] short of a Jet Plane and you may not
[1:58:58] realize it or not but there have been
[1:59:00] mid-air collisions
[1:59:03] with jets and Eagles
[1:59:05] I guess you know the jet one
[1:59:08] some birds some birds fly higher than
[1:59:10] others anybody with me and there have
[1:59:14] been many times that Eagles have been
[1:59:16] detected 15
[1:59:19] 000 feet
[1:59:20] above the surface of the Earth
[1:59:23] and that is because they are specially
[1:59:25] designed
[1:59:26] they are aerodynamically designed by a
[1:59:29] great Creator are you awake
[1:59:32] I have to be so I think you ought to
[1:59:34] have to be
[1:59:35] they were specifically designed by a
[1:59:38] great Creator to be able to soar high
[1:59:40] and let me tell you something else they
[1:59:42] have that that very special eyelid
[1:59:44] there's so many things we could remind
[1:59:46] ourselves about but they have that very
[1:59:48] special eyelid that acts like sunglasses
[1:59:52] and when all the other birds get blinded
[1:59:54] by the Sun the eagle has the ability to
[1:59:58] turn his face right in toward the Sun
[2:00:00] and that little eyelid that drops down
[2:00:02] over his eyes I just recently saw a
[2:00:05] photograph that caught the third eyelid
[2:00:08] down over the Eagle's eye and it was
[2:00:10] incredible to see because it's
[2:00:13] transparent and yet it has properties
[2:00:17] that block out the brightness of the Sun
[2:00:20] and when there are other birds harassing
[2:00:22] the eagle and they may be Mighty and
[2:00:25] Majestic but they have some they have
[2:00:27] some tormentors
[2:00:30] sure
[2:00:31] I've seen crows trying to torment birds
[2:00:34] of prey
[2:00:35] I'm not surprised are you
[2:00:38] but you know they can do something that
[2:00:39] the rest of the birds can't do they can
[2:00:41] just turn their face right into the Sun
[2:00:43] and fly just a little bit higher and
[2:00:45] leave all the squawks behind
[2:00:47] you see God called you to soar
[2:00:50] he called you to get up above the stuff
[2:00:52] that's taking other people out
[2:00:55] let me tell you something there's a lot
[2:00:57] of things taking the church out but he's
[2:00:59] given you power
[2:01:00] to get up above it if you so choose
[2:01:04] there's no Sparrow can go where an eagle
[2:01:06] can go and they have such a large
[2:01:09] wingspan up to seven feet across that
[2:01:12] they're able to use that that large
[2:01:15] wingspan to catch the currents of the
[2:01:17] air to get higher and let me tell you
[2:01:20] something they're not only High Flyers
[2:01:22] they're fast Flyers
[2:01:24] they can soar using the currents of the
[2:01:27] wind and they have been clocked at 40
[2:01:29] miles an hour which is 65 kilometers an
[2:01:32] hour I'm telling you that's booking it
[2:01:34] through the sky
[2:01:36] brother Greeley I want you to read 196.
[2:01:39] we're going somewhere
[2:01:40] from God's only provided place of
[2:01:42] worship read this for us
[2:01:46] where's this mic
[2:01:50] that's the same thing in the church
[2:01:53] they're trying to mix denomination with
[2:01:56] the word wait a minute I want to wait
[2:01:58] for the amen
[2:02:02] to make the try to make the word say
[2:02:05] what the denomination says
[2:02:08] and when you do that you have to spray
[2:02:11] them and baby them and give them gold
[2:02:14] stars to come to Sunday school and
[2:02:16] everything else let people let people
[2:02:19] have a minute
[2:02:22] pack a pews pack
[2:02:25] been a gospel church down here gives big
[2:02:27] Television Satellite sets away
[2:02:31] to get people to come to church
[2:02:32] [Music]
[2:02:34] them Old-Timers would roll over in their
[2:02:36] graves
[2:02:39] you can have free coffee and donuts in
[2:02:41] the sanctuary if you'll come to church
[2:02:46] their mixing denomination with the word
[2:02:48] yes they're they're making hot men
[2:02:51] probably say well aren't they reaching
[2:02:52] Souls yes but here's the thing many
[2:02:55] times they're not making converts no
[2:02:57] they're making they're making hot house
[2:02:59] plants yes sir members
[2:03:02] members
[2:03:03] that have to be sprayed and babied and
[2:03:06] petted come on now right right they
[2:03:08] couldn't take a real gospel spanking
[2:03:10] anybody with me I'm with you give them a
[2:03:13] gold star because you know in this day
[2:03:15] everybody gets a trophy everybody
[2:03:18] read on brother
[2:03:20] that's right
[2:03:22] when a genuine born-again Christian born
[2:03:26] with the word of God he's rugged that's
[2:03:30] you how many ruggeds here amen
[2:03:34] the lies and things of the world don't
[2:03:37] bother him praise God he's an eagle
[2:03:40] he flies Plum past it see soars in the
[2:03:43] Heavenly see it is true nothing nothing
[2:03:47] can stop him
[2:03:49] nothing can hold on
[2:03:52] now let's read Revelation 4 7 for a
[2:03:55] moment
[2:03:58] I had a I had an experience
[2:04:03] on Thursday night
[2:04:07] we had a glorious service here put the
[2:04:09] verse out please
[2:04:10] we had a glorious service here Thursday
[2:04:12] night the Lord came down in a mighty
[2:04:14] mighty way yes he did
[2:04:16] and I went home and as I began to begin
[2:04:19] to kind of Drift Off to Sleep
[2:04:21] I had an experience and I called them
[2:04:24] experiences when I'm not quite sure what
[2:04:27] they are
[2:04:29] because there are so many different
[2:04:31] things that God can use we can have
[2:04:32] dreams we can have visions we can have
[2:04:35] night visions we can have encounters
[2:04:39] and so an experience is something
[2:04:41] spiritual
[2:04:42] and you're not 100 sure I'm not 100 sure
[2:04:46] if I was dreaming if I was dreaming it
[2:04:48] happened so quickly after dozing off
[2:04:52] that it almost baffles the rules of
[2:04:54] science
[2:04:55] because it's in a certain stage of sleep
[2:04:59] that your body usually uh is dreaming
[2:05:04] and in this experience I saw a valley
[2:05:07] full of eagles
[2:05:10] many
[2:05:12] I wouldn't be afraid to say hundreds of
[2:05:15] them
[2:05:16] and they were they were staggering
[2:05:22] they they were not walking around with
[2:05:25] confidence they they were stumbling into
[2:05:28] one another
[2:05:30] and it was very concerning to me
[2:05:34] and I know this story well because
[2:05:37] it was almost 30 years ago that I wrote
[2:05:41] the chorus the song that we sung a
[2:05:43] minute ago
[2:05:45] and I wrote it after hearing Bobby
[2:05:49] Thompson who was
[2:05:51] known as the as the as the eagle
[2:05:53] preacher
[2:05:55] how many of you ever heard of Bobby
[2:05:56] Thompson
[2:05:57] he was born and raised just a few miles
[2:06:00] from here
[2:06:02] and he had one of the most unusual
[2:06:05] experiences with eagles of any man alive
[2:06:10] and he preached a series of sermons in
[2:06:13] his little bitty Baptist Church
[2:06:16] that have gone all over the world
[2:06:19] how many of you have ever heard him any
[2:06:21] of you ever heard Bobby Thompson's Eagle
[2:06:22] messages six or seven eight of you
[2:06:24] and I first discovered them
[2:06:28] ah just before hearing the message of
[2:06:33] the hour
[2:06:34] and I always loved Eagles
[2:06:38] God had spoken to me one time in an
[2:06:41] experience and he said surround yourself
[2:06:45] with eagles
[2:06:47] so I went to the Bible bookstore and I I
[2:06:51] bought a eagle picture and an eagle pen
[2:06:53] and an eagle statue and
[2:06:56] and I put Eagles all around me
[2:06:59] little did I know
[2:07:01] that it wasn't pictures of eagles
[2:07:05] I was going to surround myself with but
[2:07:08] it was walking talking believers
[2:07:10] that are called to live the eagle life
[2:07:13] I want you to know you're called to live
[2:07:15] the eagle life you may have been living
[2:07:17] the turkey life but you're called to
[2:07:19] live the eagle life you may have been
[2:07:22] living the crow life or the Buzzard life
[2:07:25] but you were called
[2:07:27] to live the eagle life
[2:07:29] and so I listened to these messages and
[2:07:33] and feasted on this experience
[2:07:37] that Bobby Thompson was able to have in
[2:07:41] in the Eagle Valley
[2:07:44] which is near Cherokee North Carolina
[2:07:47] where the Cherokee reservation is
[2:07:53] and I am Jewish
[2:07:56] on my mother's side and Cherokee Indian
[2:07:59] on my father's side
[2:08:02] so I've always loved the heritage of the
[2:08:07] Cherokee People
[2:08:09] and it is a mystery how so much of the
[2:08:14] Hebrew language
[2:08:15] has made its way into the Cherokee
[2:08:18] tongue
[2:08:19] there must be something about it because
[2:08:23] when the Cherokee Chiefs go to Israel I
[2:08:27] was there one time when Cherokee Chiefs
[2:08:30] came from other nations even that they
[2:08:33] had scattered into and gathered in
[2:08:35] Jerusalem they met with the rabbis and
[2:08:38] the newspapers reported that they were
[2:08:41] able to communicate with one another
[2:08:44] in full sentences
[2:08:47] because there's so much Hebrew in the
[2:08:51] Cherokee language don't you find that
[2:08:52] interesting
[2:08:54] brother pritzner a very intelligent
[2:08:57] German brother who used to be a part of
[2:09:00] our church who has gone home many years
[2:09:02] now to be with the Lord he was a
[2:09:04] linguist
[2:09:06] and he studied the Cherokee language and
[2:09:09] he was also so fascinated how much
[2:09:12] Hebrew language was there
[2:09:15] and so when I heard that such a place
[2:09:19] existed where the Eagles met in this
[2:09:22] Valley near Cherokee I wanted so so much
[2:09:26] to see it
[2:09:28] but I was never able to see it for
[2:09:31] myself so I have had to see it Through
[2:09:34] The Eyes of Bobby Thompson
[2:09:36] who I understand is it was very ill a
[2:09:40] couple of years ago and may have already
[2:09:43] gone to be with the Lord for all I know
[2:09:45] now
[2:09:46] he may be one of the only living
[2:09:50] non-cherokee non-native American men
[2:09:54] that was ever allowed to go and see this
[2:09:58] Valley where the Eagles go when they
[2:10:02] reach about their middle age
[2:10:05] so when I saw in this experience
[2:10:08] Thursday night these Eagles stuggering
[2:10:11] around and stumbling around in this big
[2:10:14] Valley I immediately begin to think
[2:10:17] about that
[2:10:19] and I thought surely I'm seeing these
[2:10:23] Eagles in their in their moping period
[2:10:26] in their period of of middle age and
[2:10:31] brother Branham tells us in the message
[2:10:33] that it's only one particular kind of
[2:10:36] eagle that goes through this this kind
[2:10:39] of experience and
[2:10:41] I preached this last year
[2:10:44] and I showed the church some historical
[2:10:48] references where even Rabbi spoke and
[2:10:52] said that every 10 years
[2:10:55] the eagle goes through this period that
[2:11:00] he nearly forgets who he is
[2:11:04] he forgets how to fly
[2:11:09] he forgets
[2:11:11] that he was born to soar the heights
[2:11:16] and he finds himself
[2:11:19] pecking around
[2:11:21] and the Eagles actually come from miles
[2:11:24] and miles around to this particular
[2:11:26] Ridge and Valley near Cherokee North
[2:11:29] Carolina
[2:11:30] on reservation land and close to the
[2:11:34] public and when Bobby Thompson was there
[2:11:37] he saw over 30 Eagles
[2:11:40] down in that Valley
[2:11:42] unable to fly
[2:11:45] so in my experience if you're following
[2:11:48] me I
[2:11:49] I thought maybe that's what I was seeing
[2:11:53] but I began to see uh what looked like a
[2:11:57] dark
[2:11:58] hooded
[2:11:59] very small figure
[2:12:02] not the size of a man or a woman but but
[2:12:05] much smaller
[2:12:07] what I call an imp
[2:12:11] with a hood over its face
[2:12:14] and it was moving
[2:12:16] very very
[2:12:19] you know none conspicuous among those
[2:12:22] Eagles
[2:12:24] and I saw in his in its hand
[2:12:28] a pair of shears
[2:12:33] I begin to recognize
[2:12:36] that this creature of of some sort
[2:12:40] had made its way through this vast
[2:12:44] number of eagles who had come here to
[2:12:45] rest
[2:12:47] and he was clipping the feathers
[2:12:52] of their wings
[2:12:55] he was disabling them like we preached
[2:12:58] last night
[2:12:59] so that they would no longer be able to
[2:13:02] fly
[2:13:03] and I I
[2:13:06] begin almost immediately to notice
[2:13:10] that I had two companions
[2:13:13] one was sitting on my right
[2:13:16] one was sitting on my left
[2:13:19] and I didn't know who they were exactly
[2:13:22] one looked a little familiar to me but I
[2:13:25] couldn't quite make out who it was
[2:13:30] I turned to the one on my left
[2:13:34] and I said how long
[2:13:38] will it take
[2:13:40] for these feathers
[2:13:42] to grow out
[2:13:45] so that these Eagles
[2:13:47] can fly again
[2:13:51] he said to me
[2:13:53] it comes in Cycles
[2:13:57] and I said what does that mean he said
[2:14:00] some seven years
[2:14:03] some 14 years
[2:14:06] some 21 years
[2:14:09] and some 28 years
[2:14:15] I said what happens
[2:14:19] if an eagle hasn't
[2:14:22] got his feathers back
[2:14:25] in 28 years
[2:14:29] and he says
[2:14:30] they die
[2:14:34] I just began to grieve you know you you
[2:14:37] you're not going to feel what I felt
[2:14:40] because I'm in the middle of it
[2:14:42] I just begin to rock like this
[2:14:46] and I begin to travail in the spirit
[2:14:51] grown and moan in the spirit
[2:14:55] there's nothing any sadder brother
[2:14:57] Branham talks about taking Joseph to the
[2:14:59] zoo
[2:15:01] and there's nothing any sadder than
[2:15:04] seeing an eagle that was destined for
[2:15:06] the sky locked up in some kind of cage
[2:15:12] unable to fly
[2:15:14] I was in the in the in the park in in
[2:15:17] Tennessee where they where the national
[2:15:19] Federation to protect the American bald
[2:15:22] eagle was headquartered
[2:15:24] and and they took in these injured
[2:15:27] Eagles and at least they gave them a
[2:15:29] netted aviary
[2:15:31] so that when they began to get their
[2:15:33] strength back they had some room to fly
[2:15:37] but I too remember seeing one over here
[2:15:40] in the cage
[2:15:41] that had been hit by a car
[2:15:44] and had to have his wing amputated
[2:15:48] and I saw that eagle with my own eyes
[2:15:50] turned toward that that hilly area some
[2:15:54] of you were there
[2:15:56] where all those other eagles were nested
[2:15:58] and and flying around
[2:16:01] and his cage was right across from that
[2:16:05] from that aviary
[2:16:07] and it seemed to me like
[2:16:10] he had the saddest expression
[2:16:13] on his face
[2:16:15] because he too was born
[2:16:17] to soar
[2:16:20] but with a wing amputated he would never
[2:16:24] reach those Heights again
[2:16:26] and so it would just really
[2:16:30] saddened my heart
[2:16:32] there's nothing sadder
[2:16:34] than seeing something that was born to
[2:16:38] be free
[2:16:39] suddenly become
[2:16:43] uh uh uh contained
[2:16:47] in such a way that it can't make its
[2:16:51] flight
[2:16:52] I have seen it in the natural
[2:16:56] and I've seen it in the spiritual and
[2:16:59] what I was looking over in the spirit
[2:17:02] Thursday night was a group of eagles
[2:17:06] that had just stopped to rest
[2:17:09] but there's a time to rest
[2:17:13] and there's a time to soar
[2:17:19] there's a time to roost in a tree
[2:17:22] and there's a time to take to the sky
[2:17:26] but they made a fatal mistake
[2:17:29] they came all the way down and touched
[2:17:32] the Earth
[2:17:35] there's something about the pull of the
[2:17:38] Earth
[2:17:40] that holds the eagle
[2:17:44] these Eagles that Bobby Thompson saw
[2:17:49] he was taken there
[2:17:51] by a Cherokee whose name was Tacoma
[2:17:57] he had never seen that many Eagles in
[2:18:00] the wild
[2:18:02] they actually took a Jeep
[2:18:04] down into the valley
[2:18:07] and
[2:18:09] Tacoma
[2:18:11] encouraged this preacher
[2:18:13] to go and pick up one of the Eagles
[2:18:17] folks I know you're terribly tired
[2:18:23] could you please
[2:18:27] he said no not me
[2:18:29] he said I'm no I'm no dummy
[2:18:32] he said I know you can't handle a wild
[2:18:36] eagle like that
[2:18:37] without some kind of protective gear
[2:18:43] your hands would be ripped up and your
[2:18:48] face could be mauled by the beak of this
[2:18:51] uh
[2:18:53] ferocious
[2:18:56] bird of prey
[2:18:59] Tacoma said no Bobby you don't
[2:19:02] understand
[2:19:04] these Eagles are helpless
[2:19:08] he said I want you to go and pick one up
[2:19:11] and I want you to look in his eye
[2:19:15] he said are you sure
[2:19:17] he said yeah let me go pick one up for
[2:19:19] you and he went and picked up an eagle
[2:19:22] and he handed it you know how large they
[2:19:24] are
[2:19:24] and he handed it to Bobby Thompson
[2:19:28] and Bobby said I looked in his eyes
[2:19:32] and I've never seen a look like that
[2:19:34] eagle had
[2:19:36] he said all around its eye
[2:19:41] was a crust
[2:19:44] that looked like psoriasis
[2:19:48] and it had gotten so bad
[2:19:52] that it had infected the Eagle's eye
[2:19:57] and I rubbed my hand down the
[2:20:00] the feathers
[2:20:03] because I knew enough to know
[2:20:07] that an eagle is self-oiling
[2:20:11] from the feathers
[2:20:14] comes in oil
[2:20:17] a natural oil that keeps those feathers
[2:20:22] fresh
[2:20:24] and
[2:20:26] soft
[2:20:28] and he said I rubbed my hand down that
[2:20:31] eagle
[2:20:32] and it was just dry as a carpet
[2:20:37] there was no oil
[2:20:39] he said I looked at his talons
[2:20:43] and all of his claws were broken off and
[2:20:47] bleeding
[2:20:48] and it looked like some kind of a
[2:20:51] parasite
[2:20:54] and eaten away
[2:20:57] at the knuckles
[2:20:59] on that Eagle's Talon
[2:21:02] how did it happen it happened because
[2:21:06] the eagle in the cycle of his life went
[2:21:10] down to that Valley and he never
[2:21:12] intended to stay but a while
[2:21:15] oh
[2:21:16] he didn't know the pull of the
[2:21:19] wilderness
[2:21:21] he didn't know the gravitational pull of
[2:21:24] planet Earth
[2:21:26] he said I'll just go down and rest for a
[2:21:30] moment or two
[2:21:31] I won't stay there long
[2:21:35] just long enough to get my breath
[2:21:38] just long enough to get my second wind
[2:21:42] but instead he got weirier
[2:21:46] and wearier and wearier until he
[2:21:51] literally forgot
[2:21:54] how to fly
[2:21:58] Bobby Thompson said I asked a coma
[2:22:03] what is this awful
[2:22:05] calcium looking buildup
[2:22:09] on the on the beak
[2:22:12] on the nostril
[2:22:15] of this eagle
[2:22:18] and he said it's a natural occurrence
[2:22:22] when an eagle gets in this stage
[2:22:25] his feathers begin to fall out
[2:22:29] because he forgets that oil that what
[2:22:33] has been instinct
[2:22:35] shuts down
[2:22:37] and the oil stops flowing
[2:22:40] he forgets to use his talent
[2:22:43] those Talons were not made to walk like
[2:22:46] feet
[2:22:47] so as he walks around in the wilderness
[2:22:51] he picks up these parasites
[2:22:53] right
[2:22:55] and because he can't heal himself
[2:22:57] anymore
[2:22:58] and oil himself anymore
[2:23:01] those parasites begin to take over
[2:23:04] and the calcium deposits anybody
[2:23:06] listening
[2:23:08] I'm not angry
[2:23:10] and the calcium deposits start building
[2:23:13] up
[2:23:15] and Bobby said his chest his breast
[2:23:19] was heaving in my arms
[2:23:22] good
[2:23:24] because he was no longer able to fill
[2:23:27] his lungs
[2:23:29] with oxygen
[2:23:31] he said the hardest thing that has ever
[2:23:33] happened to me in my life
[2:23:35] was to have to put that eagle back down
[2:23:37] oh he said I wanted to throw it in the
[2:23:41] air
[2:23:45] he said I asked a coma
[2:23:47] should I go up on the on the mountain
[2:23:50] there and throw it off the cliff
[2:23:55] surely that would remind it
[2:23:57] that it has the power to fly
[2:24:01] this Cherokee Indian said no Bobby
[2:24:04] that wouldn't make a bit of a difference
[2:24:07] because this eagle has literally
[2:24:09] forgotten what he is
[2:24:13] he said well there's nothing left then
[2:24:17] he'll die
[2:24:21] Tacoma said Bobby
[2:24:25] how about you and I going over here in
[2:24:27] this little place where the where
[2:24:29] there's a little rub out in the in the
[2:24:31] mountain
[2:24:32] and we hide ourselves in those bushes
[2:24:35] he said I want to show you something
[2:24:38] Bobby said I was going to see it all
[2:24:40] that day
[2:24:42] we went over and we sat in those little
[2:24:44] bushes he said and
[2:24:46] he began to hand me a binocular
[2:24:49] seven a pair of binoculars and
[2:24:52] he said I want you to begin to look up
[2:24:54] and he said I don't see anything with my
[2:24:55] natural I don't see anything
[2:24:57] but he said I began to look through
[2:24:59] those binoculars and way above natural
[2:25:02] sight there were Eagles circling
[2:25:06] and he said it it almost reminded me of
[2:25:10] how buzzards do
[2:25:13] they were just circling and circling and
[2:25:16] circling
[2:25:17] he said over dozen
[2:25:20] certainly
[2:25:22] he said and I noticed that every time
[2:25:26] they circled they were getting lower
[2:25:29] and lower
[2:25:30] and lower and lower and lower
[2:25:33] he said they finally got close enough
[2:25:37] that I could see that they were very
[2:25:40] mature Eagles
[2:25:42] their size and their strength
[2:25:45] allowed me to know and I said to him
[2:25:48] these are seniors these are veteran
[2:25:51] Eagles and Tacoma said yes that's
[2:25:54] exactly right
[2:25:56] he said not only that Bobby these
[2:26:01] were just like those Eagles there
[2:26:07] in fact a year ago those Eagles You see
[2:26:11] there were down in that Valley in the
[2:26:15] same shape that the rest of those Eagles
[2:26:17] were Bobby said how did they have such a
[2:26:21] change
[2:26:23] he said
[2:26:25] I'm going to show you
[2:26:28] Bobby said oh
[2:26:31] their talons are closed
[2:26:34] they've got something in their talons he
[2:26:37] said yes they do
[2:26:39] he said and they're going to drop it and
[2:26:41] when they do I want you to run out and
[2:26:42] see what it is so he said I started
[2:26:44] climbing down to the bottom
[2:26:46] back to the bottom and all of a sudden
[2:26:48] he said I those Eagles Circle they kept
[2:26:51] circling the whole way
[2:26:53] like a reverse whirlwind
[2:26:56] and just as they got just above the tree
[2:26:58] line they opened their talons and they
[2:27:01] began to drop down what it was that they
[2:27:03] were holding he said I ran out into the
[2:27:06] clearing clearing fast enough darted
[2:27:08] right back into the shrub and realized
[2:27:11] that it was squirrels
[2:27:14] it was half rabbits
[2:27:21] he said I don't understand this
[2:27:24] he climbed his way back up to Tacoma and
[2:27:26] he said what in the world is happening
[2:27:29] and Tacoma said these Eagles who have
[2:27:32] been through this trial
[2:27:37] they remember that when they had gone
[2:27:41] their last mile
[2:27:44] somebody came by and dropped down for
[2:27:49] them food
[2:27:55] bloody bloody beat
[2:27:58] [Applause]
[2:28:00] and they were able to eat it
[2:28:04] and because they ate it it gave them
[2:28:08] strength
[2:28:12] it didn't change their their parasite
[2:28:15] talons
[2:28:17] it didn't change their their psoriasis
[2:28:20] eyes
[2:28:21] it didn't change the calcium over there
[2:28:25] they're breathing
[2:28:28] but it gave them strength
[2:28:31] to do something about it
[2:28:33] [Music]
[2:28:38] their feet are busted and
[2:28:40] hanging in their beaks are clogged
[2:28:43] their feathers
[2:28:45] are ruffled
[2:28:50] they look awful
[2:28:53] but they're chewing on a piece of
[2:28:54] squirrel
[2:28:58] they're chewing on a piece of rabbit
[2:29:02] they're getting their strength back
[2:29:05] there's nothing like fresh meat
[2:29:09] how many of you have ever fanned
[2:29:12] on the fresh meat of the word
[2:29:17] it's strength to us
[2:29:21] he said to him immediately what happens
[2:29:26] what happens if they don't eat the meat
[2:29:29] he said there were three
[2:29:33] this is how he described it
[2:29:38] they'd use their wings
[2:29:41] to crawl over to that piece of meat
[2:29:44] their talent's so painful they couldn't
[2:29:47] no longer put him on the ground
[2:29:49] so they used the bend of their wings
[2:29:52] like elbows
[2:29:55] I've seen people that desperate
[2:29:59] wished you could help me
[2:30:01] I've seen people that hungry
[2:30:06] I've seen people
[2:30:09] that made up their mind in the spur of a
[2:30:12] moment
[2:30:13] pack it all up
[2:30:16] none of it matters anyway
[2:30:19] I just gotta be somewhere where there's
[2:30:23] some rabbits
[2:30:25] I gotta get some squirrels
[2:30:28] I can't afford to lay here in this
[2:30:32] Wilderness and die there's a danger
[2:30:35] Church
[2:30:36] of staying too long
[2:30:39] in the wilderness
[2:30:41] missing your opportunity
[2:30:45] great Danger
[2:30:48] of course when you do it you get laughed
[2:30:50] at and you get made fun of and you get
[2:30:51] mocked
[2:30:55] the crows
[2:30:58] someone help me with another one please
[2:31:04] I'm going to get this out as hard as it
[2:31:05] is
[2:31:12] you see some people
[2:31:14] have forgotten what it was like
[2:31:16] to be that desperate
[2:31:20] but not these Eagles circling no
[2:31:23] they remembered what it was like and so
[2:31:26] they're calling now their their purpose
[2:31:29] now
[2:31:30] they're they're not they're not
[2:31:32] wandering around saying I'm too old to
[2:31:34] do anything for the Lord
[2:31:37] I'm too wore out to do anything for God
[2:31:39] no their sake is long as they're
[2:31:42] strength in my body
[2:31:45] as long as I can grab a squirrel and rip
[2:31:48] him apart
[2:31:49] as long as I can get me a rabbit and rip
[2:31:52] his heart off and take it down to those
[2:31:56] egos who are struggling
[2:32:01] years ago it used to be handing someone
[2:32:03] a tape
[2:32:05] giving someone a spoken word book
[2:32:08] now it's pointing them to a nap
[2:32:11] for a while it was giving them an MP3
[2:32:13] disc
[2:32:14] now it's just showing them where to go
[2:32:16] on their phone
[2:32:18] and they can hear that that spiritual
[2:32:21] food
[2:32:25] and while the modern Church finds it
[2:32:28] Antiquated and old-fashioned
[2:32:31] we find it to be Eagles food
[2:32:36] it doesn't put us off
[2:32:38] that he preached it a generation ago
[2:32:41] because it's more apropos it's more
[2:32:44] appropriate for the hour we're living in
[2:32:46] right now
[2:32:48] you don't have to follow this messenger
[2:32:51] and you don't have to follow this
[2:32:53] message but you be careful what you say
[2:32:55] against it because it's been life to me
[2:33:02] you can follow the double married and
[2:33:04] the triple married and the quadruple
[2:33:06] married preachers
[2:33:07] you can do those things if that's what
[2:33:09] you want to do but I'm going to stay
[2:33:11] with that word
[2:33:14] because that's what's given me the
[2:33:16] strength
[2:33:17] that's why I'm heading toward 50 years
[2:33:20] of ministry
[2:33:21] because that word has sustained me did I
[2:33:25] always like it no
[2:33:28] was it always easy to agree no
[2:33:31] did it tear down my paradigms and shake
[2:33:34] up my ideas
[2:33:37] did it change my baptism
[2:33:42] did it help me to see who I really was
[2:33:45] yes
[2:33:47] and it's life to me
[2:33:49] so we can just say to people now you you
[2:33:52] just pick up your phone
[2:33:54] and you can feed
[2:33:57] you can feed on that great message
[2:34:00] that God gave us you can you can feed
[2:34:02] you can feed on services from here
[2:34:05] you can feed on other Ministries that
[2:34:07] are preaching the full unadulterated
[2:34:10] uncompromised word of God with integrity
[2:34:20] no extra charge for that
[2:34:24] it is the truth
[2:34:26] he said well what happens
[2:34:28] to those who because three I think I
[2:34:30] might have told you three immediately
[2:34:35] you know I could just about name those
[2:34:37] three
[2:34:43] they made their way over there and
[2:34:45] started getting some some strength
[2:34:49] some nutrition
[2:34:50] some nourishment
[2:34:53] but there were many who never made the
[2:34:55] effort
[2:34:57] so tired so weary so seemingly
[2:35:00] discouraged depressed because literally
[2:35:03] those they have actually had scientists
[2:35:05] to come in there
[2:35:07] and watch what has taken place
[2:35:11] and they describe it as as a a
[2:35:14] depressive state
[2:35:17] the eagle has forgotten what it is who
[2:35:20] it is we might say and forgotten how to
[2:35:23] get back to it
[2:35:26] Bobby said Tacoma what happens to the
[2:35:29] Eagles that won't eat he said I see a
[2:35:30] bunch of them they're not eating
[2:35:31] anything he said come here
[2:35:34] you took him down a little Trail
[2:35:36] and there were 27 markers
[2:35:41] 27 big stones
[2:35:44] and he said I've only been coming here
[2:35:46] this place and its location has been
[2:35:48] passed down to me from generation to
[2:35:50] generation my father came before me my
[2:35:52] grandfather came before him
[2:35:54] and my great-grandfather before him
[2:35:58] he said are you telling me these are the
[2:36:00] Eagles that have died through these
[2:36:01] Generations he said no
[2:36:03] these are the Eagles that have died
[2:36:05] since I've been coming to this Valley
[2:36:08] and I buried them myself 27 Graves
[2:36:11] of eagles who were too young to die
[2:36:15] Eagles who were too young to give up
[2:36:18] who had once had their strength who had
[2:36:20] once had their their Grace oh my
[2:36:25] when were we here that three three
[2:36:27] eagles just a few weeks ago when was
[2:36:30] that that we were here on an afternoon
[2:36:33] and there were three eagles circling
[2:36:34] over the campground
[2:36:35] last Saturday was it we're putting up
[2:36:37] the tent is that what it was no
[2:36:40] in the youth meetings
[2:36:43] but during the youth meetings
[2:36:46] we've seen a pair of eagles here before
[2:36:48] but never three
[2:36:50] but this time there were two Eagles and
[2:36:52] when I was growing up there were no
[2:36:54] Eagles in this area at all no one saw
[2:36:57] eagles
[2:36:59] and now under their protected status
[2:37:01] we've been seeing them around this area
[2:37:04] there's nothing like it even the little
[2:37:06] children because they have heard the
[2:37:08] eagle stories and the preaching and they
[2:37:11] know even the little children get
[2:37:13] excited I do too I'm the biggest child
[2:37:15] of all
[2:37:17] I love to see them circling over this
[2:37:19] place because once upon a time God said
[2:37:22] build me a refuge
[2:37:28] Refuge he said he said they will come
[2:37:30] from the North and the South and the
[2:37:32] East and the west and they will take
[2:37:34] refuge here and I will shake them down
[2:37:37] and sustain them and fill them with my
[2:37:41] spirit
[2:37:42] is that it
[2:37:45] he said I will train them in the
[2:37:48] prophetic
[2:37:49] you said it
[2:37:51] I can't deny it
[2:37:54] and so when we see those natural Eagles
[2:37:56] circling around here it reminds us then
[2:37:59] I see the kids on the on this on the
[2:38:02] volleyball court and I say we've got
[2:38:04] Eagles here and we've got Eagles here
[2:38:08] in a church full of eagles here this
[2:38:10] morning
[2:38:12] I'm telling you if you have found
[2:38:14] yourself in a moping state if you have
[2:38:17] forgotten who you are and what you are
[2:38:20] and you don't have strength God has been
[2:38:23] gracious to us this week
[2:38:27] no I'm not the best preacher
[2:38:30] no I know I'm not I I have no thoughts
[2:38:34] of that
[2:38:35] brother Greeley would never claim
[2:38:38] I was I was embarrassed I told the
[2:38:41] church quietly
[2:38:43] I was embarrassed
[2:38:45] I was counting on brother Brooks to be
[2:38:47] here
[2:38:48] there are not a lot of ministers that we
[2:38:50] can have for our camp meeting
[2:38:53] I I I'm too too long in this fight
[2:38:57] to be schooled
[2:39:02] by others who haven't experienced
[2:39:05] the history of this house
[2:39:07] I'm just not going to be be uh undressed
[2:39:12] on why the gifts operate here freely
[2:39:15] and why tongues are not always
[2:39:16] interpreted sometimes their prayer and
[2:39:19] worship
[2:39:20] I'm just not going to have I'm just not
[2:39:22] going to have them come in here
[2:39:25] and correct this body
[2:39:27] who has already been through so much
[2:39:29] correction
[2:39:30] to be as close as we are and we realize
[2:39:33] there's a whole lot further to go if
[2:39:35] that sounds prideful I don't know what
[2:39:37] to say
[2:39:38] but I have an obligation to protect this
[2:39:41] people
[2:39:42] but I was embarrassed when it came down
[2:39:46] we prayed we fasted God lead us to the
[2:39:49] right person then it was so late
[2:39:51] that anybody that we would have
[2:39:53] considered inviting we were embarrassed
[2:39:55] to invite
[2:39:58] because it was so late it's almost like
[2:40:00] saying well we can't get anybody else so
[2:40:04] would you come
[2:40:06] so we got in this cycle of a tether
[2:40:09] not knowing exactly what to do
[2:40:12] but I know this God knows
[2:40:15] he saw you he saw your desire to be here
[2:40:19] and I pray that you've been blessed
[2:40:23] now I don't know about the last three
[2:40:24] services but I'll tell you what when
[2:40:26] this meeting was starting off God was
[2:40:29] using Brother Greeley to drop some
[2:40:31] squirrels
[2:40:32] okay
[2:40:34] some fresh rabbit legs
[2:40:37] so that if you were in that place where
[2:40:40] you didn't have strength to fly if you
[2:40:42] lead on that
[2:40:44] and it's here you're taking home with
[2:40:45] you
[2:40:48] you can take it home with you it's on
[2:40:49] the app
[2:40:51] you can hear it again and again and
[2:40:52] again and again and again
[2:40:54] when you find yourself in that place
[2:40:57] Hallelujah
[2:40:59] why don't you just say hallelujah
[2:41:03] give me a water break I'm hurrying this
[2:41:05] is hurry
[2:41:07] [Applause]
[2:41:08] foreign
[2:41:14] 27 Graves
[2:41:17] marked where an eagle refused to eat
[2:41:20] what was sent to him
[2:41:23] so he died
[2:41:26] how many times does God send you a word
[2:41:29] brother sister and you refuse to eat it
[2:41:32] let it Digest
[2:41:34] maybe it comes from a package that
[2:41:36] you're not familiar with maybe it comes
[2:41:39] from someone you don't know and so
[2:41:40] you're discard it because you you're
[2:41:42] just sure it couldn't be God let me tell
[2:41:44] you something God can speak to you
[2:41:46] through a cereal box
[2:41:49] God can speak to you through through a
[2:41:52] mailman
[2:41:54] through a clerk in the store God can
[2:41:56] talk to you if you're listening
[2:41:58] he's constantly trying to remind us of
[2:42:01] who he is
[2:42:03] we must not remain any longer than
[2:42:06] necessary
[2:42:07] in the wilderness
[2:42:09] and we must eat the fresh meat that God
[2:42:12] sends to us when he sends it
[2:42:15] because it's our source of life
[2:42:18] it's our source of strength now I want
[2:42:21] you to take us to letting off the
[2:42:22] pressure
[2:42:24] looks like I'm on my own
[2:42:27] to read
[2:42:30] but I can
[2:42:35] now before I read it
[2:42:38] oh my
[2:42:48] time is such a strange thing
[2:42:53] it it it never slows down for me
[2:42:59] it always speeds along here I think I've
[2:43:02] just been introducing my message
[2:43:13] let me read you before we do this let me
[2:43:15] read your Revelation no no no no no no I
[2:43:18] don't want to do that
[2:43:19] I will finish my experience
[2:43:26] every eagle has a rock
[2:43:31] when when a mama and a daddy build a
[2:43:33] nest they build it on a rock
[2:43:36] most of the time
[2:43:38] not always
[2:43:43] but in that Valley of of Cherokee North
[2:43:46] Carolina there's a lot of Rock
[2:43:49] and Bobby said it wasn't hard to
[2:43:51] identify a nest all along the upper edge
[2:43:54] of those Cliffs
[2:43:57] built right on top of huge Boulders he
[2:44:00] described one as being the size of a
[2:44:02] school bus
[2:44:04] and a big old Eagles Nest plopped right
[2:44:07] in the middle
[2:44:09] he said that rock becomes an
[2:44:11] identification for that Eagles those
[2:44:13] eaglets that are born there
[2:44:15] and that eagle as he matures will go
[2:44:18] back many times to visit that rock
[2:44:22] and if possible
[2:44:24] when he goes to
[2:44:25] bear his own Young
[2:44:30] she I get it I know how it works they go
[2:44:33] back to the same rock that they were
[2:44:36] born on you know what may an eagle mates
[2:44:38] for life
[2:44:40] an eagle doesn't try on partners for
[2:44:43] size
[2:44:44] shall I preach
[2:44:47] an eagle makes up its mind I'm going to
[2:44:50] get me the right one and I'm not going
[2:44:51] to I'm not going to trade off I'm going
[2:44:54] to find the right one and I encourage
[2:44:56] young people to find the right one
[2:45:01] and and don't dare settle
[2:45:04] for anything but the one that God has
[2:45:06] chosen for you
[2:45:07] I don't care what they look like
[2:45:10] I don't care if they're striped like a
[2:45:13] zebra
[2:45:14] if it's the one that God has given you
[2:45:17] you will love him
[2:45:21] you your heart will be one with him and
[2:45:25] he'll be the best looking zebra you've
[2:45:27] ever seen to you
[2:45:30] because it's not just the natural
[2:45:33] beauty that is attractive
[2:45:36] you better find someone that loves God
[2:45:38] more than he loves anything else or she
[2:45:41] loves God more than she loves anything
[2:45:43] else you better be finding somebody that
[2:45:45] will point you back to the Rock
[2:45:48] when you get down in the valley and you
[2:45:50] forget who you are you better get you a
[2:45:53] companion that'll come and throw you a
[2:45:55] squirrel and point you back to the rock
[2:45:57] you were born on
[2:46:00] Bobby said uh now now what will happen
[2:46:03] when these Eagles get strong
[2:46:06] and he said I'll tell you what
[2:46:08] Tacoma said take the binocular and focus
[2:46:12] on those Eagles that are eating
[2:46:14] and then raise it
[2:46:17] and raise it and raise it and raise it
[2:46:22] and finally he said stop
[2:46:25] Bobby said he looked in the binocular
[2:46:28] and all along the far Ridge
[2:46:32] he began to identify Eagles
[2:46:35] six or seven
[2:46:37] Eagles
[2:46:39] along the the lower part of of the he
[2:46:43] said at the top it was Boulders and
[2:46:44] boulders and boulders and then then
[2:46:46] beneath those Boulders smaller smaller
[2:46:48] rocks at the top and then trees on the
[2:46:50] side
[2:46:51] he said I had not seen them before
[2:46:54] I saw the Eagles in the valley I saw the
[2:46:57] Eagles coming down but I had not
[2:46:59] distinguished those Eagles there and he
[2:47:01] said I just I just scanned the whole
[2:47:04] area and I saw six or seven Eagles and
[2:47:08] he said I I asked him what are they
[2:47:10] doing
[2:47:11] he said last week
[2:47:14] or the week before
[2:47:16] they were Eagles down in that Valley
[2:47:18] eating the fresh squirrel
[2:47:21] eating the fresh rabbit
[2:47:23] now
[2:47:25] they have used their wings
[2:47:28] can't fly
[2:47:30] can't use their talons
[2:47:33] they have used their wings to pull
[2:47:35] themselves up
[2:47:38] maybe you've never struggled that hard
[2:47:42] maybe you've never had a battle like
[2:47:44] that in the spirit
[2:47:47] hell trying to take your life the spirit
[2:47:50] of suicide swarming around you in the
[2:47:54] late hours of the night the devil lying
[2:47:57] in your head and telling you nobody
[2:47:59] would care her and the world wouldn't
[2:48:01] miss a beat if you were gone
[2:48:05] maybe you've never been in that kind of
[2:48:06] a struggle maybe maybe you've never
[2:48:08] heard the enemy say you've destroyed
[2:48:11] your children they'll never serve God
[2:48:13] you just as well to give up
[2:48:18] maybe you've never heard the enemies say
[2:48:21] you're a fool
[2:48:23] you've given all your money to that
[2:48:25] church how will you pay your bills now
[2:48:30] maybe you've never had a struggle like
[2:48:33] that
[2:48:34] there's folks in this room
[2:48:37] that have
[2:48:43] and we know what it feels like
[2:48:46] when the Holy Ghost feeling is gone
[2:48:49] when there is no music
[2:48:51] when there is no song when there is no
[2:48:54] preaching to make you happy when
[2:48:57] everything you loved is gone
[2:49:02] and the bills have pied up piled up
[2:49:05] and the dog has died
[2:49:11] you've tried to kill the cat and cats
[2:49:19] everything's wrong
[2:49:22] it's in that hour that you need every
[2:49:24] bit of the strength you've got
[2:49:27] because you're heading back to the Rock
[2:49:33] you see that eagle knows if I can just
[2:49:35] get back to that rock
[2:49:37] I know you're weary
[2:49:40] me too
[2:49:42] if I can just get back to that rock
[2:49:46] brother Greely read paragraph 40 for me
[2:49:50] letting off the pressure listen
[2:49:54] wait a minute they've turned the mic off
[2:49:56] and and left
[2:50:01] why don't you just hang out there my
[2:50:03] precious brother
[2:50:04] I was reading here not long ago I
[2:50:07] preached a subject called The Eagle
[2:50:09] stirth its nest in Chicago
[2:50:12] I was reading about a certain kind of an
[2:50:14] eagle there's 40 different kinds of them
[2:50:16] they claim
[2:50:18] means a ripper with the beak
[2:50:21] God always Likens his people to Eagles
[2:50:23] he calls himself Jehovah eagle
[2:50:27] and his little Eagles that's those who
[2:50:30] are born of him
[2:50:31] and I made a little rude illustration
[2:50:33] many times on that how that how the
[2:50:36] eagle gets her little ones ready to fly
[2:50:38] and takes them up in the air and turns
[2:50:40] them loose yes and if a crow tried to
[2:50:43] get up there every feather would fall
[2:50:46] out of him he's not pressurized to it
[2:50:48] amen see he couldn't stand the pressure
[2:50:51] but the eagle is the only Bird that's
[2:50:55] born with that kind of a Feather that
[2:50:57] can go so high till a hawk couldn't even
[2:51:00] come around him
[2:51:02] and he's got eyes
[2:51:04] the higher you go the further you can
[2:51:06] see wait a minute
[2:51:11] read that again the higher you go the
[2:51:15] further you can see
[2:51:16] you're the one stay in the valley no no
[2:51:18] no
[2:51:23] hey redone and what good would it do him
[2:51:26] to get up there
[2:51:27] if he didn't have eyes to see anyway
[2:51:30] he couldn't get back where he came from
[2:51:34] and that's the way with the Christian
[2:51:36] some of the people maybe got a buzzer
[2:51:39] disposition
[2:51:40] and eating the things of the world and
[2:51:43] the vulture and try to fly up there with
[2:51:45] an eagle why he blows up there's too
[2:51:48] much pressure you've got to be made for
[2:51:50] it you've got to be made
[2:51:56] the bride is made for the Heights she's
[2:52:02] made for the pressure yes
[2:52:04] he knew it was going to take pressure
[2:52:07] pressure yes to squeeze us into the
[2:52:10] image of Christ we'll never come to the
[2:52:14] stature of the perfect man without
[2:52:16] pressure without pressure but he
[2:52:18] pressurized us yes so that we can handle
[2:52:21] it yes read on brother and this certain
[2:52:24] kind of Eagle when he begins to get old
[2:52:26] he gets weary like all of us old people
[2:52:29] and he gets a crust over his head and he
[2:52:32] gets so weary he don't know what to do
[2:52:35] and now the Bible said the eagle renews
[2:52:39] his youth
[2:52:40] so I studied about this fellow and when
[2:52:43] he gets old and weary and that crust all
[2:52:45] over his head
[2:52:47] he flies just as high he can go till he
[2:52:50] finds a great High Rock
[2:52:52] he sets down by the side of this rock
[2:52:54] and he sits there and beats his head on
[2:52:57] this rock
[2:52:59] what's he trying to do
[2:53:01] beat the crust off all the crust and the
[2:53:05] blood will fly out of his head he goes
[2:53:08] through all kinds of torture but as long
[2:53:11] as he can get to feel some of that crust
[2:53:14] on him he's got to get that off
[2:53:17] so he beats it on the Rock just keeps
[2:53:20] beating until all the crust is off of
[2:53:22] his head and as soon as all of the crust
[2:53:25] is off of his head though he's bleeding
[2:53:28] wounded he just screams to the top of
[2:53:31] his voice
[2:53:41] is off then he renews his youth it's
[2:53:44] sure to come so as soon as all the crust
[2:53:47] is gone he can start screaming because
[2:53:50] he knows he's got ribs he's got rid of
[2:53:55] all the crust now hold it just a minute
[2:54:00] they tell you not to be noisy
[2:54:04] you don't understand I was smothering
[2:54:07] yes sir
[2:54:09] yes sir
[2:54:10] Bobby said I heard him go
[2:54:16] he couldn't get a breath uh-huh
[2:54:20] cutting off the oxygen
[2:54:23] Nearly Dead
[2:54:25] and I've got back to the Rock beat my
[2:54:28] head till the crust has come off and you
[2:54:30] don't want me to be noisy right
[2:54:33] too bad too bad
[2:54:36] too bad too bad
[2:54:39] your screaming's gonna give me a
[2:54:41] headache
[2:54:42] well your whining has given me one or
[2:54:44] two along the way
[2:54:47] we're just trading out
[2:54:51] not your visitors
[2:54:53] haven't known you long enough to hear
[2:54:55] you whine read on
[2:54:58] so his youth is sure to be renewed so he
[2:55:01] can just let off the pressure and start
[2:55:03] screaming what
[2:55:05] he can let off the pressure and start
[2:55:08] screaming
[2:55:10] because he's going to be a young Eagle
[2:55:13] again
[2:55:15] that's wonderful I'm glad for the eagle
[2:55:18] I'm glad for that bird I'm glad for me
[2:55:22] hallelujah hallelujah one more but you
[2:55:25] know
[2:55:26] I know a rock where that we can go and
[2:55:30] be in prayer till all the crust of the
[2:55:33] world is beat away from us till all of
[2:55:37] the unbelief in God's word is feed away
[2:55:40] till we enter into a place where all
[2:55:44] things are possible
[2:55:47] Hallelujah and as soon as we get all the
[2:55:50] world and the unbelief in God's word
[2:55:52] beat off of us then we can Scream and
[2:55:56] Shout because
[2:55:58] eternal life is sure just as certain as
[2:56:01] anything
[2:56:02] certainly because all the world is beat
[2:56:06] off
[2:56:07] Hallelujah if you keep the world unto
[2:56:10] you keep loving the world and the things
[2:56:13] of the world you're sure to die yes but
[2:56:16] if you can get away from all of that
[2:56:19] then your youth will be restored you'll
[2:56:23] have eternal life so glad of that
[2:56:27] praise the Lord with me
[2:56:29] [Applause]
[2:56:35] paragraph 76 same message
[2:56:39] no a different different same title
[2:56:41] different City
[2:56:43] paragraph 76 letting off the pressure
[2:56:45] Green Lake Wisconsin the next one you
[2:56:48] have it you don't have that one
[2:56:51] let me read it to you it's very short
[2:56:53] and if he can't knock it off
[2:56:56] he dies
[2:56:58] but if he gets it knocked off he'll
[2:57:01] start rejoicing and screaming yeah you
[2:57:03] can hear him for Miles just screaming
[2:57:06] yes going to be renewed because he got
[2:57:08] the crust off yes
[2:57:10] got the cursed off
[2:57:13] Bobby said he got to see I think he
[2:57:15] might have gone back
[2:57:17] another time
[2:57:19] he said I I got to see one of those
[2:57:21] Eagles
[2:57:23] who had sat on that rock for days
[2:57:27] scraping his Talons not just beating the
[2:57:29] beak but scraping his talents until all
[2:57:33] those parasites were scraped off
[2:57:35] until those claws had broken off and new
[2:57:39] claws begin to form
[2:57:42] surely takes his beat once he's beat off
[2:57:45] all the calcium Bobby says he takes his
[2:57:48] his beak
[2:57:50] and begins to pluck out the bloody
[2:57:53] feathers
[2:57:56] you know some people
[2:57:58] they like for people to see what they've
[2:58:00] been through all the time
[2:58:02] so somebody can feel sorry for them but
[2:58:05] I just got to be honest none of us have
[2:58:07] time to feel sorry for each other
[2:58:08] because we're all going through the same
[2:58:10] stuff
[2:58:12] we have compassion we must have
[2:58:15] compassion we must have empathy we must
[2:58:18] be kind one to another but you can't be
[2:58:20] petted in this thing
[2:58:22] it's not a petting you need it's not a
[2:58:24] caressing you need it's somebody to
[2:58:26] scream at you all the way back to the
[2:58:28] top of the mountain don't stop
[2:58:31] you need somebody to say a little
[2:58:33] further
[2:58:35] you can do it commonly higher don't give
[2:58:38] up now
[2:58:40] we need that
[2:58:43] we need a coach
[2:58:46] somebody that'll kick us even a little
[2:58:48] bit not just and say don't stop now
[2:58:51] you've come too far
[2:58:54] you're so close now to the victory
[2:59:01] said as soon as this beak is cleared off
[2:59:04] then he's plucking those bloody feathers
[2:59:06] out
[2:59:07] throwing them over on the other side
[2:59:10] next thing you know like Samson
[2:59:15] Samson's new shock of hair
[2:59:18] new feathers begin to grow
[2:59:21] he begins to oil again
[2:59:23] Hallelujah anybody with me
[2:59:26] he begins to oil himself again
[2:59:29] he looked no wonder it's called renewing
[2:59:31] his youth got new feathers got a
[2:59:34] beautiful now now sharp uh Italians are
[2:59:37] sharp and everything's good
[2:59:41] Tacoma told Bobby that Eagles
[2:59:44] cry
[2:59:47] he said it's part of the oiling process
[2:59:51] and that he had observed for years
[2:59:53] healthy Eagles
[2:59:55] crying
[2:59:57] huge puddles of water and oil
[3:00:01] running out of their eyes and down their
[3:00:04] face to keep them clean and to keep them
[3:00:07] fresh keep them healthy
[3:00:11] but when that eagle is down in that
[3:00:13] moping period it loses its ability to
[3:00:15] self-oil
[3:00:16] and so therefore there's nothing coming
[3:00:18] out of those tear ducts
[3:00:20] to keep him fresh and
[3:00:22] and healthy
[3:00:24] but Bobby said I got to be there one day
[3:00:27] and I saw
[3:00:28] with my binoculars
[3:00:31] an eagle that had finished his course
[3:00:34] he had cleaned himself he had beat his
[3:00:38] head on the Rock he had got all the
[3:00:41] calcium off and the parasites out the
[3:00:43] new feathers had come and the oil was
[3:00:45] flowing again
[3:00:47] and he said I caught it in my binoculars
[3:00:50] as the biggest tears I'd ever seen huge
[3:00:54] puddles of of water and oil began to run
[3:00:57] down that that Eagles and he said he
[3:00:59] took his he took it as it would come
[3:01:01] down over his shoulder the top of his
[3:01:03] wing and he would rub it
[3:01:07] he used his wing to rub it all over him
[3:01:11] I've been in that kind of an anointing
[3:01:14] I've been in that kind of presence where
[3:01:17] I just wanted to bathe and bask in the
[3:01:19] presence of God
[3:01:22] and I'm not ashamed of it it it keeps
[3:01:25] life in US
[3:01:30] he said and I wasn't prepared for the
[3:01:32] screen
[3:01:34] he said I saw that that mouth come open
[3:01:37] and I heard a scream that reverberated
[3:01:41] Hallelujah down the sides of that Canyon
[3:01:44] wall all the way down there to the
[3:01:47] bottom where those Eagles were trying to
[3:01:49] get their street back
[3:01:51] and he let out an eagle scream
[3:01:54] oh
[3:01:57] you know what he was saying I made it
[3:02:02] I made it
[3:02:05] you can too I made it back to the wrong
[3:02:11] I found mine I found my hell
[3:02:16] I found my home
[3:02:20] I got back to the Rock caught

[3:15:44] that would not only draw profit into the
[3:15:46] heights
[3:15:48] but would draw prophetic people
[3:15:50] into the Heights
[3:15:53] brother Branham said that flying eagle
[3:15:55] anointing was a prophetic anointing and
[3:15:58] it would come to raise us up
[3:16:00] too many people read that and they say
[3:16:02] well that was him no no he was
[3:16:05] forerunning something
[3:16:07] every one of us who see the truth
[3:16:10] God is revealed to us this word it's
[3:16:12] it's it's our privilege
[3:16:15] to get up above
[3:16:17] to come into that why it doesn't say a
[3:16:20] walking lion
[3:16:23] it didn't say a talking man
[3:16:26] it didn't say a bellowing ox
[3:16:29] the only living creature that was given
[3:16:31] action was the eagle
[3:16:36] that's why the moving of the spirit is
[3:16:39] so important to stay in that flow and
[3:16:43] let the spirit move because it reminds
[3:16:46] us of what anointing we're carrying
[3:16:49] we're carrying the anointing of a flying
[3:16:52] eagle
[3:16:53] turn me up just a little bit
[3:16:56] so I turned to the left
[3:16:59] and I said
[3:17:02] how long will it take for these feathers
[3:17:04] to grow out
[3:17:06] and he said it comes in Cycles
[3:17:09] seven years
[3:17:10] 14 years
[3:17:12] 21 years
[3:17:14] 28 years
[3:17:16] and my mind began to ponder that in the
[3:17:19] experience
[3:17:20] because my life like your life whether
[3:17:23] we whether you've ever had time to think
[3:17:24] about it or not it lays in Cycles either
[3:17:27] 7 10 or 12.
[3:17:30] and you can go back over your life and
[3:17:32] Mark those and some some people have
[3:17:34] have all three Cycles
[3:17:37] significant things shifted in brother
[3:17:39] branham's life every seven years and
[3:17:42] then it later he mentions other numbers
[3:17:45] so I thought that's very profound
[3:17:49] I wish that it was
[3:17:51] a lot less time than that
[3:17:55] and as I thought that thought
[3:17:58] the one who was to my right spoke up
[3:18:03] and he laid his hand over on the bend of
[3:18:05] my arm
[3:18:06] this
[3:18:08] and leaned in
[3:18:10] and he said to me because the days are
[3:18:15] short
[3:18:18] there will come and acceleration
[3:18:23] in the regrowth of the feathers
[3:18:29] said Satan didn't mean only to
[3:18:35] debilitate the Eagles from flying he
[3:18:39] meant to kill them
[3:18:44] so I assume it was to keep him from The
[3:18:48] Rock
[3:18:50] but because the days are short
[3:18:54] there will now come an acceleration
[3:18:59] and we won't have to wait for our seven
[3:19:01] year cycle to get back to where we
[3:19:04] desire to be in Christ to get our
[3:19:08] feathers
[3:19:09] fresh
[3:19:11] [Music]
[3:19:15] grown out again
[3:19:19] the eagle has five primary feathers on
[3:19:22] the tips of its wings
[3:19:25] and when it's teaching it's young to fly
[3:19:29] it has the ability to rotate those five
[3:19:33] feathers only not the wings
[3:19:37] scientists say it's like a joint that's
[3:19:40] not a joint
[3:19:42] it's cartilage and there seems no
[3:19:45] explanation for it
[3:19:47] sometimes clockwise sometimes
[3:19:49] counterclockwise
[3:19:51] the eagle is able to rotate only those
[3:19:54] feathers and it creates because of his
[3:19:57] aerodynamic body it creates a
[3:19:59] centrifugal force
[3:20:03] there's a Hebrew word for it Nasha
[3:20:07] and that force is what
[3:20:11] pulls us back to Papa
[3:20:15] when that eagle is he's thrown the
[3:20:18] babies out of the nest
[3:20:20] they've learned to fly but they haven't
[3:20:23] learned to soar
[3:20:25] papa will take them out on on maneuvers
[3:20:29] exercises
[3:20:32] and they stay you know how we do
[3:20:36] those little ones stay as close to Mama
[3:20:38] or as close to Daddy as possible until
[3:20:40] they get to feeling their strength
[3:20:43] and sometimes mama will look down or
[3:20:45] papa will look down and see that the
[3:20:47] little eaglet has gotten a little too
[3:20:49] far for its experience
[3:20:51] it's not quite not quite experienced
[3:20:53] enough to be that far from Papa or Mama
[3:20:55] and you know what the eagle does
[3:20:56] mama or daddy just starts rotating those
[3:20:59] five primary
[3:21:00] feathers and it creates a centrifugal
[3:21:04] force and the Hebrew word is Nasha and
[3:21:07] it means to be pulled up
[3:21:09] and literally that little Eagle when
[3:21:10] it's got too far away when Mama does
[3:21:13] that that's centrifugal force pulls that
[3:21:15] Eagle right up under the chest of mama
[3:21:17] or daddy
[3:21:20] and they don't turn it loose
[3:21:22] until it's learned its lesson
[3:21:24] aren't you glad
[3:21:27] that when you're not in the valley
[3:21:28] you're flying you're doing well all of a
[3:21:31] sudden you get to thinking you can do it
[3:21:32] without Papa
[3:21:34] has anybody ever been there you didn't
[3:21:36] do it on purpose you didn't do it on
[3:21:38] purpose you just started stepping out
[3:21:40] without waiting on his instruction
[3:21:42] you just started doing things without
[3:21:44] him telling you to do you just got very
[3:21:46] used to this kind of leadership but it
[3:21:48] wasn't Holy Ghost leadership it was your
[3:21:50] human Spirit leading you and not Holy
[3:21:53] Spirit leading you and the next thing
[3:21:54] you know here's Papa
[3:21:58] nausea
[3:22:00] pulling you right back up under his
[3:22:02] bosom
[3:22:03] sing it again
[3:22:05] now you know what you're singing about

[3:26:12] even the world

[3:26:21] those cycles of an itch
[3:26:25] that comes in a marriage
[3:26:28] where there's a temptation to be
[3:26:30] unfaithful
