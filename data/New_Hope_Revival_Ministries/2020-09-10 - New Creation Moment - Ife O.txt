TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we would begin to see god honoring his word in our mouth like he did in the prophets of old [Music] now we are discovering even at this late hour we're discovering as the bride that we are not here just to live our own lives we are here to be a reflection of the sun amen and his life and in order to get to that place there's a lot of guilt that has to be canceled there's a lot of shame that has to be canceled and you are the only one i can speak positive words over you you can speak positive words over me but as an individual we are the only ones that can receive god's perfect gift that's been given to us you have to release the shame i have to release my shame you have to release your guilt i have to release mine you have to trade your condemnation for acceptance and i have to trade my condemnation for acceptance we have been made accepted in the beloved that's where our true acceptance comes from can i tell you something jesus accepts you if you have come to him in confession and true repentance he accepts you i believe that in order to fully appropriate the power of the blood of jesus christ in our life we're going to have to work on the way we think about the blood it's not just a blanket that we put on and we can say we're covered it's so much more than that it is a total regeneration it changes the believer even on a cellular level when the bible says you are a new creation you are a new creature it means what it says you are of another breed the believer then through that work of regeneration becomes a new race think of that that settles the race war for the believer you're above caucasian you're above african-american you're above nation you become by the transforming power of the blood of jesus christ a new race amen a royal race after the royal seed of abraham and that means that we have power to think a new way and speak a new way but i want you to know with a real understanding and a real revelation of what the blood has accomplished in our life with a rewiring of our thought process with a change of our vocabulary we would begin to see god honoring his word in our mouth like he did in the prophets of old and nobody is going to wake up one day i'm sorry to tell you you're not going to wake up one day thinking different and speaking different it's not going to fall on us like ripe cherries from a tree top is it it's going to be a practice it's going to be a process the word is changing us from faith to faith from strength to strength from glory to glory
