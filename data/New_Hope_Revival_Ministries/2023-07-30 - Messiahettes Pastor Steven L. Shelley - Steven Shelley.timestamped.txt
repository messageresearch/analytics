[43:29] into work let's lift her up to the Lord
[43:31] Jonathan Hollis has been fighting this
[43:35] week and I won't ask the Lord to
[43:37] encourage him and he's supposed to be
[43:39] with us this coming weekend Sister Kate
[43:43] Dane sent a note and said that her air
[43:45] conditioner has gone out in Florida
[43:48] and that financially she is strained and
[43:51] needs a miracle let's ask the Lord to
[43:53] move for her the greeleys are away let's
[43:57] ask God to be with them the missionary
[43:59] Camp starts this week we won't be able
[44:01] to attend I think the greeleys will be
[44:04] there for a service or two but let's
[44:06] pray that the needed finances are raised
[44:09] during that camp to bless the
[44:11] missionaries around the world the
[44:13] hawxians are still away we want to hold
[44:15] them up to the Lord and of course uh RJ

[1:06:05] he is the one that is worthy
[1:06:08] you may be seated this morning I know
[1:06:10] you've been standing a lot in his Chad
[1:06:13] said you've been up and down I hope
[1:06:14] that's not spiritually I hope it's just
[1:06:16] physically up and down
[1:06:19] and that's just part of being in a
[1:06:21] Pentecostal meeting
[1:06:22] I know that some Churches sing the whole
[1:06:26] congregational set sitting down
[1:06:30] and I I just uh you know I'm not
[1:06:32] Catholic and I'm not Baptist Methodist
[1:06:35] or any of those others and uh I've never
[1:06:38] I've never felt like one could enter in
[1:06:40] quite as good
[1:06:42] and uh I think that it really really
[1:06:45] helps when we put everything that we've
[1:06:48] got
[1:06:49] we we write out a prescription and we
[1:06:52] say Lord this is what I have need of
[1:06:54] today
[1:06:55] and I want you to meet me in my praise I
[1:06:58] want you to meet me in my worship I want
[1:07:01] you to meet me through your word
[1:07:03] and then I want you to come and say Amen
[1:07:07] and he will do that
[1:07:09] if you believe it say Amen let me have
[1:07:11] your undivided attention for a little
[1:07:13] while today
[1:07:15] uh there are just so many
[1:07:19] many things going on all at one time
[1:07:24] and we must be spiritually Vigilant and
[1:07:28] alert
[1:07:29] and maybe you saw the post that we made
[1:07:32] I won't take time this morning although
[1:07:34] I would really love to talk about it a
[1:07:36] little bit at depth but uh since 2019
[1:07:42] uh especially around this time around uh
[1:07:46] tishbe of the ninth of off the day that
[1:07:50] we mourn the loss of the temple somebody
[1:07:54] said why would a Christian even remember
[1:07:57] such a thing as that because Jesus
[1:07:59] pointed us
[1:08:00] to that Earthly Temple as our example of
[1:08:05] what his body would accomplish as our
[1:08:07] spiritual Temple
[1:08:09] and we've heard in the message of the
[1:08:12] hour what house will you build me and so
[1:08:15] since 2019 at Tish bayaf
[1:08:18] uh sort of unusually in in 2019 I think
[1:08:24] there were three and in 2023 there was
[1:08:27] only one a fox that appeared on the
[1:08:32] Temple mount
[1:08:33] now if you have been there which
[1:08:35] fulfilled not only scripture but it
[1:08:38] fulfilled Jewish oral law
[1:08:40] and uh it was quite interesting because
[1:08:44] the Bible talks about foxes
[1:08:47] uh one translation says hopping among
[1:08:50] the ruins
[1:08:52] if you saw the picture that I posted of
[1:08:55] the single Fox he is literally sitting
[1:08:59] on the ruins
[1:09:02] there there are are is there any way
[1:09:05] charity that you could bring that
[1:09:06] picture up
[1:09:08] it's incredible when you think about it
[1:09:11] I've been to the Temple mount
[1:09:13] oh I don't know 75 times 80 times 100
[1:09:17] times not always up on top but in the
[1:09:20] quotel The Wailing Wall the Western Wall
[1:09:22] I've never seen a fox in the city of
[1:09:25] Jerusalem
[1:09:26] and uh lamentation speaks about it
[1:09:30] there's another prophecy one of the
[1:09:32] other prophets of the Old Testament
[1:09:33] talks about it uh that that foxes will
[1:09:37] go in and out and around the ruins of of
[1:09:40] the temple and that in it's written in
[1:09:44] the mishnah
[1:09:45] in talmudic times
[1:09:47] it's written that just leave that up
[1:09:50] there a minute how many of you can see
[1:09:51] that
[1:09:52] and I was able to verify through a
[1:09:55] friend living in Jerusalem that that
[1:09:57] photograph was taken on tishbe the ninth
[1:09:59] of off
[1:10:00] and there's a video I posted also a
[1:10:03] video of the fox running through running
[1:10:06] through the temple Mound and down uh out
[1:10:09] through the temp through the through the
[1:10:10] cartel Courtyard but anyway
[1:10:14] uh where was I
[1:10:17] this particular picture is so
[1:10:20] interesting because those rocks
[1:10:23] that they are sitting on this is this is
[1:10:26] in this is at what we call the ophel
[1:10:30] and in the Bible Mount oh fail it is an
[1:10:34] area I believe it's also referred to now
[1:10:37] as the Davidson archaeological uh
[1:10:40] complex
[1:10:42] and it if if the Western Wall is here
[1:10:45] just say this is the Western Wall which
[1:10:48] is the retaining wall of the Temple
[1:10:51] mount the temple sat up on top this has
[1:10:54] now become the Wailing Wall or the
[1:10:56] Western Wall and then you would turn the
[1:10:58] corner and the old fell is here the city
[1:11:02] of David is there the pool of Siloam is
[1:11:05] there down at the bottom of the hill
[1:11:07] there are steps ancient Steps From the
[1:11:11] second temple from the time of Jesus
[1:11:13] that are coming up this southern end of
[1:11:16] the Temple mount
[1:11:17] and in front are ruins of mikvahs the
[1:11:22] the holy uh ritual baths that the Jews
[1:11:27] had to bathed themselves in before they
[1:11:30] could go up and worship at the temple
[1:11:34] now when Titus besieges the city of
[1:11:37] Jerusalem they literally
[1:11:40] shoved the stones of the temple and the
[1:11:44] and the upper compound off the retaining
[1:11:48] wall and they have sat there for two
[1:11:51] thousand years
[1:11:52] so those stones that you see see how
[1:11:55] some of them are shaped
[1:11:58] I don't hear nobody answering me
[1:12:01] some of them look like just Stone just
[1:12:03] rocks but some of them look very shape
[1:12:06] so those stones have sat there for 2 000
[1:12:09] years and the scripture talks about
[1:12:12] foxes playing on the on the ruins of the
[1:12:15] temple and there they are
[1:12:18] and there is a writing I know where I
[1:12:20] was now there's a writing in the mishnah
[1:12:23] in the talmudic from talmudic times that
[1:12:26] speaks specifically about foxes
[1:12:29] reappearing on the ruins of the temple
[1:12:32] just prior to the rebuilding of the
[1:12:35] Third Temple
[1:12:37] and so both Jews and Gentiles have have
[1:12:42] passed this uh picture and the video all
[1:12:45] over the world and the Jews are excited
[1:12:48] about it because they believe that it is
[1:12:50] signaling the the rebuilding of the
[1:12:53] temple and Believers are excited about
[1:12:56] it because anything that brings us
[1:12:59] closer to that brings us closer to
[1:13:01] Resurrection rapture
[1:13:03] and so we get excited about it too
[1:13:06] so things are moving in an unusual way
[1:13:10] and we feel them in the natural
[1:13:13] we feel the kickback
[1:13:16] uh sister Anna Christine has put a real
[1:13:21] could we play it could you find the Reel
[1:13:25] that has over 21
[1:13:26] 000 views
[1:13:28] this week if you go to our Facebook
[1:13:31] uh I I'd like for everybody to see it we
[1:13:34] have we've never had so much response
[1:13:37] some of it most of it positive I guess
[1:13:40] most maybe I'm not sure if we've passed
[1:13:42] that because she's deleting and I'm
[1:13:44] deleting
[1:13:46] ugliness
[1:13:47] and uh
[1:13:49] she even you know reached out yesterday
[1:13:51] and said you know uh Pastor if if I if
[1:13:55] this is bringing too much attention that
[1:13:57] we don't want then you know we can just
[1:13:59] we can do away with it but no no no no
[1:14:02] no no no no no no no no no no no
[1:14:05] I'm not ashamed
[1:14:08] there's nothing in that clip or any
[1:14:10] other clip up there that I'm ashamed of
[1:14:12] and if 21 000 people have viewed it I'm
[1:14:15] a happy man
[1:14:16] I hope 51 000. I hope I hope 151 000
[1:14:21] people I I hope a million view it
[1:14:23] because sometimes all it takes is one
[1:14:27] little tiny seed
[1:14:30] to cause somebody to dig
[1:14:33] I remember how God brought sister Nancy
[1:14:35] in Jerusalem to the message of truth I
[1:14:38] presented one message
[1:14:41] and she she sent for me
[1:14:44] she said bring bring him back over here
[1:14:47] I want to meet him in the garden I want
[1:14:49] to ask some questions after one message
[1:14:52] and she served me tea and the brothers
[1:14:54] were there waiting on me she served me
[1:14:56] tea and she said now tell me the whole
[1:14:58] story
[1:14:59] she said you were just dropping little
[1:15:00] nuggets out but I'm smart enough to know
[1:15:03] you've got something behind everything
[1:15:05] you said
[1:15:06] and that brought her here to be baptized
[1:15:09] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:10] play this real quick I hope you're still
[1:15:12] alert stay alert with me would you
[1:15:16] the church world has it so wrong because
[1:15:19] they're so upset with how God has been
[1:15:21] presented that they are presenting a God
[1:15:24] that's not even the god of the Bible
[1:15:26] when you hear people say God don't care
[1:15:28] how you dress and God don't care how you
[1:15:30] live and God don't care how you're
[1:15:32] baptized I want you to know that is a
[1:15:34] false god
[1:15:38] that's not the god of the Bible
[1:15:40] the god of the Bible is very specific
[1:15:42] about how you conduct yourself how you
[1:15:44] live your life
[1:15:46] you see this is where the church that's
[1:15:48] all it was
[1:15:50] that's always sin
[1:15:54] and you'd be surprised
[1:15:59] you would be surprised as some of the
[1:16:02] comments that people make who made you
[1:16:04] the boss what who gives you Authority
[1:16:06] what do you what do you know
[1:16:10] well not much
[1:16:12] I've only been studying the Bible 50
[1:16:15] years
[1:16:16] but I still don't know it all
[1:16:21] uh so this this is a good thing because
[1:16:24] it's causing people well I'll just tell
[1:16:26] you we went up a hundred followers in
[1:16:28] two days on Facebook
[1:16:30] what that means is when we live our
[1:16:33] services like right now they'll see it
[1:16:36] it'll come up in their feed they will
[1:16:38] know
[1:16:39] and so I can see the potential of God
[1:16:42] reaching his seed
[1:16:45] I'm excited about having a part of that
[1:16:47] but it brings a lot of backlash to me
[1:16:51] personally to my family into this body
[1:16:54] of Christ
[1:16:55] spiritually it stirs up things in that
[1:16:59] other realm so would you pray a little
[1:17:01] more and spend a little more time
[1:17:04] praying for us and praying against that
[1:17:08] backlash
[1:17:11] I was asking a question
[1:17:14] because it it uh sometimes manifests
[1:17:18] itself physically and sometimes it can
[1:17:21] be emotionally sometimes it can be
[1:17:23] spiritually
[1:17:24] and uh we've learned that I don't know
[1:17:27] why it seems like we're we're forgetting
[1:17:29] it but we've learned that through the
[1:17:31] years and it can actually affect all of
[1:17:33] you
[1:17:34] so we have to be prayed up there's a
[1:17:37] prayer covering that must be lifted up
[1:17:39] over this house and this ministry and
[1:17:42] the leadership so that the enemy when he
[1:17:44] comes against it he'll just bounce back
[1:17:48] and uh you know some have sent videos
[1:17:51] around this week uh questioning brother
[1:17:54] Branham and they've sent this and and
[1:17:56] trying to wear on some of the young
[1:17:58] people and just different things going
[1:18:00] on and we just have to pray because in
[1:18:03] the end I heard him sing this morning
[1:18:06] the lion of the tribe of Judah prevails
[1:18:10] truth wins
[1:18:13] truth wins and we want to stay on the
[1:18:17] word and we want to stay on the truth
[1:18:19] amen
[1:18:20] so uh as Chad mentioned this has been an
[1:18:24] amazing week because we announced last
[1:18:26] week that the Lord had give had provided
[1:18:30] one hundred thousand dollars toward the
[1:18:34] uh
[1:18:35] principle of the of the building and it
[1:18:38] took a little while you know you you'd
[1:18:40] be surprised all the approvals you have
[1:18:42] to get when you're writing a check for
[1:18:45] that amount first of all I had to speak
[1:18:48] it probably took me seven or eight
[1:18:50] minutes sister Flo to write the check
[1:18:55] because I had to make sure I could get
[1:18:58] it right
[1:18:59] the sex and when I had to put it in them
[1:19:02] little boxes
[1:19:05] I had to count the spaces
[1:19:09] because we the payment was one hundred
[1:19:11] thousand and seventy five dollars now
[1:19:14] that'll throw you off one zero zero zero
[1:19:18] seventy five point zero zero and I'm not
[1:19:21] used to writing anything above ten
[1:19:23] dollars
[1:19:26] and so I had to count the boxes and and
[1:19:30] and you never you would never believe
[1:19:33] the approval processes as we went along
[1:19:35] that day
[1:19:36] uh no no teller can can approve you you
[1:19:40] can't even deposit that kind of money
[1:19:42] without approval
[1:19:46] you know makes you want to tell them
[1:19:47] listen if anybody ever comes along here
[1:19:50] and wants to put a hundred thousand
[1:19:51] dollars in my account will you please
[1:19:53] let them do it
[1:19:55] no
[1:19:57] you have to have a cashier's check and
[1:20:00] when you go to buy the cashier's check
[1:20:03] it has to be approved
[1:20:05] and and the the girl said to the to the
[1:20:08] teller beside her she said can you
[1:20:10] approve oh no she said I can't approve
[1:20:12] anything over seventy thousand so we
[1:20:15] have to get the bank manager out to
[1:20:17] approve and then to deposit and to
[1:20:19] approve it on and on and on and I don't
[1:20:22] care none of it bothered me
[1:20:25] I didn't let anything bother me I smiled
[1:20:29] the whole day
[1:20:31] at the goodness of God
[1:20:35] [Applause]
[1:20:41] I feel necessary to tell you one more
[1:20:44] time when you would wonder where it came
[1:20:47] from it came from him
[1:20:51] that's where it came from
[1:20:53] so you can quit asking me and you can
[1:20:55] quit asking my family
[1:21:02] because that's where it came from
[1:21:04] amen so just let me remind you I don't
[1:21:08] discuss your giving
[1:21:13] I don't go around telling people that
[1:21:15] there are some of you that have been
[1:21:16] here for years and never paid made a tie
[1:21:18] check
[1:21:22] I don't go around telling people what
[1:21:24] you give or don't give
[1:21:26] foreign
[1:21:27] and so and as I said we have people from
[1:21:31] all over the world
[1:21:33] it may not be huge amounts always but we
[1:21:35] have people all over the world who give
[1:21:37] there's a couple in England who send
[1:21:39] offerings almost weekly
[1:21:42] and and we're just blessed because we
[1:21:44] have so many friends and so many loved
[1:21:47] ones and God did it I had one brother to
[1:21:49] text me and he said all I know is I
[1:21:52] prayed specifically
[1:21:54] and I said Lord would you find someone
[1:21:58] and speak to their heart who could give
[1:22:00] one hundred thousand dollars
[1:22:09] [Applause]
[1:22:12] isn't he good
[1:22:15] he is so good I don't think I have the
[1:22:17] original balance
[1:22:19] wrote down here but it was uh
[1:22:22] it was close to a half a million dollars
[1:22:25] and can I tell you what the new balance
[1:22:27] is
[1:22:29] 42 000.
[1:22:34] 626.67 let's give God praise Hallelujah
[1:22:41] praise the Lord
[1:22:43] it's official
[1:22:47] [Applause]
[1:22:49] it wasn't official last week because we
[1:22:52] hadn't made the payment yet we did that
[1:22:54] on Friday
[1:22:55] and usually it takes a couple days for
[1:22:58] them to update the site but by the end
[1:23:00] of the day it was already updated so I
[1:23:03] was I was checking every few hours
[1:23:05] just like a little kid you don't know
[1:23:08] anybody else like that do you
[1:23:10] amen
[1:23:12] so Tuesday of this week is Sister Joyce
[1:23:14] Greeley's birthday so when she sees this
[1:23:17] service she will know that we love her
[1:23:19] and we wish her a happy birthday on
[1:23:22] Wednesday of this week August the 2nd is
[1:23:24] brother Shane minko's birthday God bless
[1:23:26] you brother happy birthday to you you
[1:23:29] share a birthday with our with our
[1:23:32] brother Benny West who has gone to be
[1:23:34] with the Lord and uh so I like that it
[1:23:38] made me feel good when I when I wrote
[1:23:40] down that brother Shane's birthday was
[1:23:42] on August the 2nd because I remembered
[1:23:44] it being brother West's birthday and and
[1:23:46] two days later on Friday would would be
[1:23:48] brother Billy's mom sister Rose Tebow's
[1:23:51] birthday
[1:23:52] and I don't believe you celebrate
[1:23:54] birthdays in heaven but I believe it's a
[1:23:56] wonderful day to remember and think
[1:23:57] about our loved ones who have gone and
[1:24:00] Saturday is Mary Beth's birthday this
[1:24:03] coming Saturday and she and Hawk and the
[1:24:05] children are living their best life in
[1:24:07] Iceland some of you have asked us about
[1:24:10] our Iceland trip and we have temporarily
[1:24:13] postponed it we are waiting for for uh
[1:24:16] passport to come back and we we could
[1:24:20] have fought and got it there was a way
[1:24:22] they told us a way that we could have
[1:24:24] kind of pushed the issue but we have uh
[1:24:27] chosen not to do that because sometimes
[1:24:30] you know you try to make things work
[1:24:32] with somebody else's
[1:24:35] schedule and you might miss what God
[1:24:38] really has for you so we don't have
[1:24:40] tickets yet but a couple of weeks after
[1:24:42] our after our scheduled return we will
[1:24:46] probably go so sometime uh in in the
[1:24:49] next month we will probably uh start
[1:24:51] making a trip to to Iceland we feel that
[1:24:54] God is calling us and that there is a
[1:24:56] purpose in it but we don't look folks
[1:24:58] it's too late in the hour to be anywhere
[1:25:01] I mean I'm invited to many many places
[1:25:04] but I have to be where God would want me
[1:25:06] to be it's too late I'm 55 years old
[1:25:09] really I know that's not not ancient but
[1:25:12] you think about how many years you have
[1:25:14] left if the Rapture should not should
[1:25:16] tarry a while longer and you you realize
[1:25:19] you don't have any more time to waste
[1:25:21] being out of God's perfect and divine
[1:25:23] will so please pray for us that we will
[1:25:26] I want to say thank you to all of you
[1:25:29] who worked so hard didn't it look
[1:25:31] beautiful out there thank you Nathan for
[1:25:33] organizing it thank you every brother
[1:25:35] every person who did what you did to
[1:25:39] make it look as beautiful as it looks
[1:25:40] right now there will be more work now
[1:25:43] putting the tables back and the chairs
[1:25:45] back and all the things to get ready for
[1:25:47] our service next Saturday night at six
[1:25:49] o'clock
[1:25:50] it is our fellowship weekend we we uh
[1:25:53] are believing that God will move and
[1:25:56] that he will have his wonderful way and
[1:25:59] our services we don't know all the folks
[1:26:01] who are coming but we've been having a
[1:26:03] great turnout if something happens that
[1:26:06] our turnout is a little less I'm not
[1:26:09] going to believe that it will be but
[1:26:10] should it be we have to keep in mind
[1:26:12] that camp meeting is coming up in
[1:26:14] October and people are asking off
[1:26:16] already to be able to come in October we
[1:26:20] have invited brother Isaiah Brooks to
[1:26:22] come we haven't had a final confirmation
[1:26:24] from him yet but he has expressed that
[1:26:27] it is his desire to come so he will be
[1:26:30] sharing the services with us this year
[1:26:32] and we're looking forward to whatever
[1:26:34] God has for us let's thank God for these
[1:26:38] musicians
[1:26:40] all that they have done
[1:26:43] thank you all so much
[1:26:45] I took my singing time so we'll have you
[1:26:47] to go down didn't Chad do a great job
[1:26:49] leading the service this morning
[1:26:53] [Applause]
[1:26:55] let's stand and go to the word
[1:26:58] will you help me
[1:27:00] I'm going to need it I just feel it I'm
[1:27:02] going to need it I'm going to need it
[1:27:04] I'm really going to need your help and I
[1:27:07] hope you won't let me down
[1:27:09] uh I have argued with the Lord a little
[1:27:12] bit I prayed I've tried to get out of
[1:27:16] this this morning and put it off
[1:27:18] because of some of the different things
[1:27:20] that have come up and happened during
[1:27:22] the week I've tried to to get off of
[1:27:25] this subject for now but the Lord just
[1:27:28] won't let me so
[1:27:31] um I want to explain a few things to you
[1:27:34] and preach the best that I can what the
[1:27:37] lord has laid on my heart and I'll start
[1:27:39] by reading Psalms 2 the second Psalm and
[1:27:44] nine verses and then I'm going to go to
[1:27:48] Romans 8 and you don't have that verse
[1:27:52] because the Lord brought brought it to
[1:27:54] my heart to read it after I was already
[1:27:56] on the platform
[1:27:58] but I'm next going to read Romans 8. 15
[1:28:02] through 23 Romans 8 15-23
[1:28:07] this is Psalms 2
[1:28:10] and verse 1.
[1:28:16] why do the Heathen rage
[1:28:19] and the people imagine a vain thing
[1:28:24] the kings of the earth set themselves
[1:28:28] and the rulers take counsel together
[1:28:32] against the Lord do you believe we're
[1:28:36] kind of living in a day like that
[1:28:38] and against his anointed
[1:28:43] now that word anointed there is is mache
[1:28:48] or mashiach or mashiach
[1:28:52] and he is specifically referring to the
[1:28:57] coming anointed one
[1:28:59] Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:03] so we will read it as Messiah but in
[1:29:07] English the translators have interpreted
[1:29:10] in most places all but one I think they
[1:29:14] have translated as Anointed The Kings of
[1:29:19] the earth set themselves and the rulers
[1:29:21] take counsel together against the Lord
[1:29:24] and that Lord there would be Adonai and
[1:29:28] against his mashiach or Messiah saying
[1:29:34] let us break their bands asunder and
[1:29:40] Cast Away their cords from us
[1:29:45] he that sitteth in the heavens shall
[1:29:49] laugh
[1:29:49] the Lord shall have them in derision
[1:29:55] that is a serious prophetic word
[1:29:59] it speaks of not only the first coming
[1:30:04] of the Messiah but the days preceding
[1:30:09] the second coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:30:11] Christ he that sitteth in the heaven
[1:30:14] shall laugh the Lord shall have them in
[1:30:18] derision then shall he speak unto them
[1:30:22] in his wrath and vix them in his sore
[1:30:28] displeasure yet have I set my king upon
[1:30:34] my Holy Hill of Zion who do you believe
[1:30:38] that King is
[1:30:42] Malik haholam the king of the universe
[1:30:47] the King of Kings and the Lord of lords
[1:30:51] the king not a king the king the sword
[1:30:55] of the king
[1:30:57] Our God I will declare the decree the
[1:31:02] Lord has said unto me thou art my
[1:31:06] my son
[1:31:08] this day have I begotten thee this is
[1:31:14] speaking to us of the eternal spirit of
[1:31:17] the father moving into a body of Flesh
[1:31:21] John 1 1 Same Spirit there are two
[1:31:25] Spirits there's only one spirit and so
[1:31:29] this was that eternal spirit of the
[1:31:31] father moving into a prophecy talking
[1:31:36] about an hour that the spirit of the
[1:31:39] Lord would move into a son
[1:31:42] Thou Art my son this day have I begotten
[1:31:47] thee ask of me and I shall give Thee the
[1:31:52] Heathen for thine inheritance and the
[1:31:55] other most parts of the Earth for thy
[1:31:59] possession I want you to know the
[1:32:02] Nations belong to the anointed
[1:32:06] the Bible tells us the Nations belong to
[1:32:10] the anointed
[1:32:12] we understand that the Nations belong to
[1:32:15] the anointed
[1:32:18] the anointed
[1:32:20] you're anointed aren't you
[1:32:23] ask ask of me and I will give Thee the
[1:32:26] Heathen for thine inheritance and the
[1:32:29] other most parts of the Earth for thy
[1:32:31] possession
[1:32:33] thou shall break them with a rod of iron
[1:32:36] Thou shalt Dash them in pieces like a
[1:32:39] Potter's vessel
[1:32:41] the Bible is prophesying to us about a
[1:32:44] time when the anointed of the Lord shall
[1:32:48] execute the righteous indignation and
[1:32:52] Judgment of our God upon the nations of
[1:32:55] the earth and Kings will bow
[1:32:57] and governments will collapse and Jesus
[1:33:01] Yeshua king of kings and Lord of lords
[1:33:05] will reign over the Earth for a thousand
[1:33:09] years of great Millennial peace and then
[1:33:12] in the new Heaven and the new Earth as
[1:33:15] our Messiah and our King Hallelujah we
[1:33:20] will sit at his feet in the Millennium
[1:33:23] and learn of him
[1:33:25] we will worship him in the restored
[1:33:29] Temple
[1:33:31] oh he is the temple we will worship him
[1:33:34] in the restored Temple because God has
[1:33:38] made a covenant with the city of
[1:33:40] Jerusalem and the land of Israel and God
[1:33:44] has said you will eternally be mine
[1:33:47] he has established the Throne of David
[1:33:51] which is a Messianic throne and a
[1:33:55] prophetic Throne he has established it
[1:33:58] forever in Jerusalem
[1:34:02] so you that have never visited Jerusalem
[1:34:04] I hope you get an opportunity to do that
[1:34:06] over here but if you don't
[1:34:10] you will worship God in the Millennium
[1:34:14] in that Holy place
[1:34:17] Jew and Gentile together
[1:34:20] no more no more segregation
[1:34:24] the Apostle Paul received the Revelation
[1:34:26] one new man both Jew and Gentile
[1:34:31] worshiping God together Lord we need you
[1:34:35] today I need you Lord
[1:34:37] I'm not here just to preach I'm here
[1:34:40] Lord to speak what you would lay on my
[1:34:43] heart and what you would speak through
[1:34:45] me I asked you today to arrest the
[1:34:49] hearts of men and women in this house
[1:34:52] arrest the hearts of those watching this
[1:34:55] service today May something be said that
[1:34:58] that would really get us really capture
[1:35:03] us for the purposes of the Kingdom
[1:35:05] Hallelujah we are not looking at the
[1:35:09] church
[1:35:10] we are looking to the kingdom
[1:35:13] and the king of all Kings leads the way
[1:35:18] help us today we pray
[1:35:22] Yeshua hamashiach in the name of the
[1:35:25] Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the saint
[1:35:27] said
[1:35:28] you may be seated
[1:35:31] Romans chapter 8.
[1:35:35] beginning in
[1:35:38] verse 14 I don't know what I told you
[1:35:41] did I tell you 15 give me 14 if you will
[1:35:44] please
[1:35:45] for as many I'll just read it and you
[1:35:48] can put 15 up if you need to for as many
[1:35:51] as are led by the spirit of God
[1:35:57] they are
[1:36:00] come on Church
[1:36:03] they are the sons of God have you ever
[1:36:07] been led by the spirit of God let me see
[1:36:09] your hand let's make this very
[1:36:11] interactive this morning and we got to
[1:36:13] go somewhere we're going to fight to get
[1:36:15] there so you might as well make the
[1:36:17] fight a little easier all right I'm not
[1:36:18] trying to whip you I'm not I'm excited
[1:36:21] and I want you to get with me so we can
[1:36:23] go somewhere as many as they're led by
[1:36:26] the spirit of God they are the sons of
[1:36:29] God I am say it I am a son of God
[1:36:37] don't that feel good to say I am
[1:36:41] a Son of God how do you know that
[1:36:43] because the Bible said so the Bible said
[1:36:46] but to as many he came to his own John 1
[1:36:48] he came to his own and his own received
[1:36:51] him not but to his many as received him
[1:36:55] to them get
[1:36:56] power
[1:36:58] to become the sons of God have you
[1:37:01] received him
[1:37:02] let me see your hand if you've received
[1:37:04] him as your savior
[1:37:06] your Messiah
[1:37:08] that's what he is a deliverer a forgiver
[1:37:11] a heart regulator
[1:37:13] a restorer a great reconciler
[1:37:17] yes the Mighty God unveiled
[1:37:23] that's who he is that's who Jesus is
[1:37:27] he's the Mighty God unveiled
[1:37:30] God didn't want to sit above us forever
[1:37:34] he wanted to come down and have fell ow
[1:37:37] fellowship with us
[1:37:39] and he did it in the body
[1:37:42] of the Lord Jesus Christ the scripture
[1:37:45] tells us in him in that Colossians in
[1:37:48] him dwelt the fullness
[1:37:51] fullness
[1:37:53] not a portion fullness of the godhead
[1:37:56] bodily
[1:37:58] so that's why Jesus could say I'm just
[1:38:00] quoting the word
[1:38:01] that's why Jesus could say when you've
[1:38:03] seen me
[1:38:06] when you've heard me
[1:38:10] come on we can say when I've touched you
[1:38:12] the father has touched you
[1:38:15] amen because I came down to reflect him
[1:38:18] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:38:21] God as many as received him
[1:38:23] they are the sons of God say I am
[1:38:27] a son of God
[1:38:30] now may I just mention to you that that
[1:38:32] word son there is squeals
[1:38:36] and it is a mature Son of God it is not
[1:38:39] a technon in Greek technon is an
[1:38:42] adolescent
[1:38:44] when we first start following the Lord
[1:38:46] leading trying to receive him into our
[1:38:48] spirit we are just tecton the Greek
[1:38:51] might say son but it's speaking of an
[1:38:54] immature son a toddler one who is just
[1:38:59] broaching into adolescence but in this
[1:39:03] verse when it says they are the sons of
[1:39:05] God he's talking about mature sons of
[1:39:09] God and and for those of you who studied
[1:39:12] the adoption of the Middle East you will
[1:39:14] understand that he's talking about Sons
[1:39:17] approved of the father they have
[1:39:20] graduated out from under the Tudors
[1:39:23] remember the New Testament talks about
[1:39:25] the Tudors they have graduated out from
[1:39:28] under the tutors they are now fully
[1:39:30] qualified to conduct business in the
[1:39:35] name of the father
[1:39:36] their name on the check is the very same
[1:39:40] as if his name was on the chat so you
[1:39:43] just might as well sign his name because
[1:39:46] the Bible says the whole family in
[1:39:48] heaven is named him
[1:39:50] the whole family in heaven has that name
[1:39:52] so you might as well sign your name
[1:39:55] don't sign it Joe Dole you might as well
[1:39:59] sign it Mrs
[1:40:02] Jesus Christ
[1:40:05] because he has a blank check for every
[1:40:07] believer I need some help he has a blank
[1:40:10] check for every believer you're not
[1:40:12] trying to get anything accomplished in
[1:40:14] your own name in your own authority
[1:40:17] you're doing it with all of Heaven
[1:40:20] backing you up Let the church say
[1:40:24] amen I am
[1:40:28] I am
[1:40:30] a Son of God have you received him
[1:40:34] to as many as received him to them gave
[1:40:37] he the power didn't you just say that I
[1:40:38] did
[1:40:41] I am
[1:40:43] a Son of God has he led you have you
[1:40:46] ever been led by the spirit then you are
[1:40:49] a son of God
[1:40:52] he doesn't lead other seeds
[1:40:58] he only leads Sons
[1:41:01] the the certified seed of God now let's
[1:41:05] go on
[1:41:06] and for for ye you Church New Hope
[1:41:11] because that's where I'm preaching
[1:41:14] you have not received the spirit of
[1:41:16] bondage
[1:41:18] that would cause you to fear
[1:41:23] bondage
[1:41:25] brings fear
[1:41:27] fear brings bondage you New Hope
[1:41:32] have not received the spirit of bondage
[1:41:34] again to fear but you have received
[1:41:38] another spirit
[1:41:40] hello I need some help
[1:41:43] you have received another Spirit you
[1:41:47] have received the spirit of adoption
[1:41:51] Hallelujah I am
[1:41:54] a son of God
[1:41:55] how do you know because I have not
[1:41:57] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:41:59] fear I have received the spirit of
[1:42:02] adoption Hallelujah
[1:42:06] and so I don't have to come oh
[1:42:09] [Music]
[1:42:11] oh
[1:42:12] [Music]
[1:42:13] I really hate to disturb you
[1:42:16] but I need help
[1:42:19] please don't slay me
[1:42:23] please don't kill me because of my
[1:42:26] Humanity
[1:42:28] we always
[1:42:30] oh what in reverential fear but we do
[1:42:32] not approach him in the kind of fear
[1:42:34] that brings us into bondage
[1:42:42] people around the message are under a
[1:42:45] spirit of bondage and they're afraid to
[1:42:49] step out
[1:42:51] to be led by the spirit to encounter the
[1:42:55] reality of a living God causes them
[1:42:58] anxiety the
[1:43:01] event has sinned to Deliver Us from
[1:43:03] anxiety
[1:43:05] causes them anxiety
[1:43:07] come on
[1:43:08] because they're so afraid of the Deacons
[1:43:15] so afraid of the trustees
[1:43:18] somebody's going to come and say now
[1:43:20] hold it down
[1:43:22] you're getting too excited about the
[1:43:25] word
[1:43:27] you're distracting others because so
[1:43:30] many others aren't plugged in
[1:43:34] I'm more worried about the ones that are
[1:43:36] plugging in than the ones that are
[1:43:38] distracted because somebody else plugged
[1:43:40] in you plug in and you won't worry about
[1:43:43] somebody else plugged in
[1:43:46] Hallelujah I am
[1:43:49] Son of God
[1:43:51] I have not received again that I have
[1:43:53] not received the spirit of bondage again
[1:43:55] to fear but I have received the spirit
[1:43:58] of adoption now don't misunderstand this
[1:44:02] doesn't mean that he has brought someone
[1:44:04] in who didn't belong to him this is our
[1:44:07] concept of adoption
[1:44:09] our concept of adoption is when we bring
[1:44:12] someone into our family who is not blood
[1:44:14] of our blood flesh of our flesh born of
[1:44:17] our bone and we make them
[1:44:20] hours
[1:44:21] and legally in many states you can
[1:44:24] disown your blood children you can
[1:44:26] disinherit your blood children but in
[1:44:28] many states you are not legally allowed
[1:44:31] to disinherit your adopted children
[1:44:38] so that that legal adoption's a pretty
[1:44:41] powerful thing
[1:44:42] and I'm not talking about America's
[1:44:44] concept or Europe's concept of adoption
[1:44:48] we're talking about uh the adoption in
[1:44:50] the middle and Far East
[1:44:52] we're talking about adoption in the
[1:44:55] second temple period which was not about
[1:44:57] bringing someone in who was not
[1:45:00] unfortunately in those days if you
[1:45:03] brought someone into your family that
[1:45:04] wasn't blood they were a Slave
[1:45:08] they were endangered that doesn't mean
[1:45:10] they were beaten necessarily it means
[1:45:13] they had a debt to work off
[1:45:15] so you fed them and you gave them a
[1:45:17] place to stay and they worked off their
[1:45:19] dead that was that was how a stranger
[1:45:21] was brought into your home in second
[1:45:23] temple period
[1:45:25] so the adoption that we're talking about
[1:45:27] here is not an adoption like America or
[1:45:30] like Europe but it is the adoption from
[1:45:33] the middle or Far East and that is where
[1:45:36] even a son
[1:45:39] even a blood full Bonafide son
[1:45:46] could not carry the authority of his
[1:45:50] father
[1:45:51] until he had sat under tutors and been
[1:45:56] trained and taught and finally the tutor
[1:46:00] would say Hey you have reached the place
[1:46:04] where you can receive the full authority
[1:46:08] of the father's adoption
[1:46:10] and we understand that they were brought
[1:46:13] to the gate of the city and friends and
[1:46:17] neighbors were called and a proclamation
[1:46:20] was made and usually read by a father or
[1:46:24] a a one who was appointed
[1:46:26] sometimes the Tudor and before the whole
[1:46:31] group of people that were gathered there
[1:46:32] the announcement was made this is my
[1:46:37] beloved Son
[1:46:42] in whom I am well pleased
[1:46:46] hear ye him
[1:46:50] the exact language that was you hello
[1:46:54] the exact language that was used at the
[1:46:57] baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:47:01] wow
[1:47:03] the same adoption
[1:47:06] fully adopted
[1:47:09] bringing you into a relationship with
[1:47:13] God
[1:47:14] where you no longer have to approach him
[1:47:17] who most holy
[1:47:21] Reverend
[1:47:22] hallowed father God Supreme
[1:47:29] no
[1:47:30] that's not the believer
[1:47:33] the believer says Papa
[1:47:39] somebody said where do you get that I
[1:47:41] just read it
[1:47:43] father
[1:47:45] you have a Hebrew word in your English
[1:47:47] Bible did you know that
[1:47:49] that's a Hebrew word Abba it didn't
[1:47:51] translate they didn't translate it into
[1:47:53] English
[1:47:55] they left it Hebrew they didn't take it
[1:47:57] to the Greek
[1:47:58] and then to the English they left you
[1:48:00] one Hebrew word to hold on to
[1:48:04] didn't dilute it
[1:48:06] Abba
[1:48:07] and I've told you many many many many
[1:48:09] many times
[1:48:11] there's no place like
[1:48:16] where you where you go on air Shabbat
[1:48:21] Friday morning you buy your fresh
[1:48:23] vegetables
[1:48:24] you buy your flowers for the Shabbat
[1:48:27] table
[1:48:28] and you get everything you need for for
[1:48:31] the whole
[1:48:33] sun down the sun down Shabbat
[1:48:36] because you're not cooking and you're
[1:48:38] not you know there's so many things
[1:48:40] you're not allowed to do
[1:48:42] and so they go by the droves especially
[1:48:45] the ultra Orthodox or the Hasidic Jews
[1:48:49] and they all have eight or ten children
[1:48:54] and they all go because Mama says get
[1:48:57] out of here
[1:48:59] so daddy is the one who usually takes
[1:49:01] all the children
[1:49:03] and remember they dress up like Sunday
[1:49:05] School
[1:49:06] they are dressed in style and they go
[1:49:10] down to the dirty old shook
[1:49:12] and they are buying groceries and the
[1:49:15] children get scattered and and let me
[1:49:17] tell you something it's not just Jews
[1:49:19] it's the whole culture of the Middle
[1:49:21] East do not go to the Middle East
[1:49:24] expecting southern hospitality and
[1:49:27] manners
[1:49:30] You're Gonna Learn a Hebrew word in a
[1:49:33] hurry
[1:49:36] it really means excuse me
[1:49:39] but they can say it in such a way that
[1:49:43] it makes you feel like you big idiot get
[1:49:47] out of my way
[1:49:51] they are on a mission
[1:49:55] they don't understand cues they're not
[1:49:57] British
[1:49:59] they don't understand lines they're not
[1:50:02] American they understand that the
[1:50:05] loudest and most aggressive one among
[1:50:08] them
[1:50:09] will buy his cucumbers first
[1:50:13] Nathan knows he's been there
[1:50:15] so they are all over you
[1:50:18] and if you want a cucumber you gotta
[1:50:20] fight for it
[1:50:22] and I kind of enjoyed it
[1:50:25] I don't like to drive in Alabama but I
[1:50:27] kind of enjoy driving in Jerusalem
[1:50:31] the horn is legal at all times
[1:50:35] and sometimes you just lay on the horn
[1:50:38] and drive
[1:50:42] out of my way
[1:50:44] it's the way
[1:50:46] kids are all running around getting lost
[1:50:49] I've always told you that when we took
[1:50:51] brother West he got lost
[1:50:53] we had to hunt him and find him it took
[1:50:56] us a while to find out where he was and
[1:50:58] you know what he said he said I wasn't
[1:51:00] lost you all were lost I knew where I
[1:51:02] was the whole time
[1:51:04] but just the rest of us didn't know
[1:51:06] there is one thing you will hear every
[1:51:09] little Jewish child say at the same time
[1:51:11] it seems uh
[1:51:17] if for some reason dad didn't come it's
[1:51:19] IMA IMA IMA IMA Ima
[1:51:24] Abba doesn't mean holy most revered and
[1:51:29] astute
[1:51:30] Father of Mine
[1:51:33] Alba means Daddy
[1:51:37] Papa
[1:51:40] it's a term of endearment that you use
[1:51:44] to speak to your father isn't that
[1:51:47] powerful you have not received
[1:51:51] a spirit of bondage again to fear you
[1:51:54] have received the spirit of adoption
[1:51:57] whereby we cry father
[1:52:02] when life overwhelms you this week and
[1:52:06] you don't know what to do next
[1:52:09] don't melt down
[1:52:11] don't take another pill
[1:52:14] [Music]
[1:52:15] say papa
[1:52:18] [Applause]
[1:52:20] oh
[1:52:23] this scripture is telling us the spirit
[1:52:26] of adoption brings you into a unique
[1:52:30] fellowship and relationship with your
[1:52:33] God
[1:52:34] that should cause you not to move in the
[1:52:37] bondage of fear but cause you to move in
[1:52:40] the liberty of the spirit that has come
[1:52:43] to set you free if you know what I'm
[1:52:45] preaching this morning say something
[1:52:48] something amen or just say something
[1:52:53] just witness in some way
[1:52:56] now he goes on
[1:52:58] the spirit itself
[1:53:01] beareth witness with our spirit
[1:53:05] that we are the children of God I am
[1:53:10] a son of God
[1:53:12] the spirit Bears Witness
[1:53:15] the spirit of adoption
[1:53:17] the spirit remember that's one of the
[1:53:19] offices of the Holy Spirit
[1:53:21] it's the same spirit
[1:53:23] one of the offices of the holy spirit is
[1:53:26] the spirit of adoption one is the spirit
[1:53:29] of conviction
[1:53:30] one is the spirit of Revelation but
[1:53:32] we're preaching right now on the spirit
[1:53:34] of adoption same Holy Spirit just
[1:53:36] another operating work or another office
[1:53:39] of the Holy Spirit or another way that
[1:53:42] the holy spirit is identifiable and
[1:53:44] working in your life are you with me
[1:53:47] and so it gives a witness to us that we
[1:53:50] are the children of God hallelujah the
[1:53:54] Bible said you'll know you're saved by
[1:53:56] the
[1:53:57] quickening
[1:53:59] of your spirit and then they say it
[1:54:02] doesn't matter how you feel or you can't
[1:54:03] you know can't go on a Feeling when it's
[1:54:05] God you you can't say well I felt God or
[1:54:07] didn't feel god well then why did the
[1:54:09] Bible say you'll know you'll know you
[1:54:11] belong to him because your spirit will
[1:54:12] be made alive
[1:54:14] come on I'm just breaking down the
[1:54:16] verses for you the spirit itself beared
[1:54:19] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:54:20] children of god let's go on
[1:54:23] and if children Hallelujah
[1:54:26] not just techno we're heirs Wheels
[1:54:30] mature Sons
[1:54:31] we are Heirs of God
[1:54:34] how many of you know what it means to be
[1:54:36] an heir
[1:54:37] it means a heaven inheritance
[1:54:41] [Applause]
[1:54:43] that I'm not going to Forfeit
[1:54:46] and it will never be taken from me hello
[1:54:50] I am Heirs of Papa God
[1:54:53] and I am joint heirs equal heirs someone
[1:54:58] say equal heirs
[1:55:03] with Christ
[1:55:05] no wonder the prophet comes along and
[1:55:06] says all that the father was
[1:55:09] he poured into the sun
[1:55:13] all that the son all that Christ was he
[1:55:16] poured into the church remember God was
[1:55:18] not satisfied to always live above us
[1:55:20] God above us he came as Emmanuel the
[1:55:23] Lord Jesus Christ so that he could be
[1:55:25] God With Us he came on the day of
[1:55:27] Pentecost I will not leave you
[1:55:28] comfortless I will come to you
[1:55:31] I'm going over these things again to
[1:55:33] help those of you who may have questions
[1:55:35] what you will find is what we're saying
[1:55:38] what we are saying is word based
[1:55:41] and we are not preaching something to
[1:55:43] you because brother Branham said it no
[1:55:47] I I want you to understand
[1:55:50] someone made a comment recently and said
[1:55:53] I I just I don't believe in the extra
[1:55:56] biblical stuff
[1:55:58] that that you talk about
[1:56:01] well I I I'm not sure exactly what that
[1:56:05] means
[1:56:06] but I assume that it means because we
[1:56:09] quote brother Branham
[1:56:10] you will not find a church anywhere in
[1:56:13] this region
[1:56:15] that a whole sermon will be delivered
[1:56:17] and someone will not be quoted
[1:56:22] it's the way ministers prepare their
[1:56:23] sermons
[1:56:25] might be Abraham Lincoln
[1:56:27] [Music]
[1:56:29] I I've been quoting the the coach of
[1:56:32] Muhammad Ali
[1:56:34] come on I quoted Muhammad Ali
[1:56:39] see so that is not extra biblical in the
[1:56:42] sense that if what is being said lines
[1:56:46] up with the word
[1:56:48] here I've been preaching to you for
[1:56:50] weeks that the Bible is our absolute
[1:56:54] it's not all of God
[1:56:57] one comment uh and a Christine that
[1:57:00] someone made it says too many people
[1:57:01] worship the Bible and you know what I
[1:57:03] would have to agree
[1:57:06] I would have to agree he said it to be
[1:57:08] negative but I would have to agree with
[1:57:10] him too many people worship a book
[1:57:14] and they don't know the Living Word
[1:57:16] [Applause]
[1:57:17] but this Bible is a written record of
[1:57:23] the word of God
[1:57:25] it's holy
[1:57:27] it is without mistake
[1:57:29] it is inerrant it is our absolute
[1:57:34] if something doesn't line up with this
[1:57:37] word it's false
[1:57:39] I don't care who said it I don't care if
[1:57:43] your preacher said it or William Branham
[1:57:45] the prophet said it or or are the Elders
[1:57:48] of the Mormon Church said it
[1:57:54] it must it has to it has to line up
[1:58:03] you you can't even learn to follow a
[1:58:06] message without some sort of absolute
[1:58:10] to take that to
[1:58:12] and that's why I can follow this message
[1:58:13] with all my heart it's because I preach
[1:58:16] what I can take back to the word
[1:58:24] and we must do that if children then
[1:58:27] we're heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs
[1:58:31] meaning equal heirs with Christ he also
[1:58:34] received an inheritance of the father
[1:58:36] you receive an inheritance of the father
[1:58:39] if so be that we suffer with him that's
[1:58:43] part of the Judgment process now that we
[1:58:46] may be you read it for me would you
[1:58:49] also glorified
[1:58:52] how
[1:58:54] together anybody with me
[1:58:57] for I reckon
[1:58:59] I just love it when Paul gets Southern
[1:59:03] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:59:06] present time are not worthy to be
[1:59:09] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:59:12] revealed in a soul bless the Lord for
[1:59:17] the earnest expectation of the creature
[1:59:20] wait wait for the manifestation of I am
[1:59:29] I am
[1:59:32] a son of God
[1:59:34] you won't always have to take my word
[1:59:36] for it I won't always have to take your
[1:59:38] word for it because one of these days
[1:59:40] God is going to manifest
[1:59:44] through you
[1:59:46] Who You Are
[1:59:49] and the world's going to know maybe not
[1:59:51] the masses are going to know but those
[1:59:53] around you are going to know that when
[1:59:55] you say I'm a Son of God it's not cheap
[1:59:58] talk
[1:59:59] but you have everything you need to back
[2:00:03] it up
[2:00:04] and until then the body groans
[2:00:08] oh does it ever Creak and groan
[2:00:13] when I'm through preaching
[2:00:16] I either go out to eat on Sunday or go
[2:00:18] home and eat
[2:00:19] I sit in the chair
[2:00:22] usually by that time and I don't want
[2:00:24] your sympathy I just sometimes want you
[2:00:26] to understand
[2:00:28] that when I can't stay around and talk
[2:00:30] to all of you like I would like to
[2:00:31] sometimes I can sometimes I simply can't
[2:00:35] and it's because until I receive the
[2:00:38] fullness of the manifestation of who I
[2:00:40] am and healing is completed and
[2:00:43] perfected in my body the reality is I
[2:00:45] don't have a day without pain
[2:00:47] and the closest that I come to it
[2:00:50] without pain most of the time 99 of the
[2:00:54] time if I'm sitting or standing or
[2:00:57] kneeling
[2:00:58] in the swimming pool
[2:01:01] I'm so thankful that our shallow end is
[2:01:04] shallow enough that I can kneel on my
[2:01:08] knees
[2:01:09] and I spent hours there yesterday
[2:01:11] kneeling on my knees in the shallow
[2:01:14] without any pressure on my sciatic nerve
[2:01:18] or my joints and I don't want to move
[2:01:22] because sometimes just moving out and
[2:01:24] sitting on a chair to dry off to go in
[2:01:26] the pain comes back
[2:01:28] and so that's how I spend a lot of my
[2:01:30] Sunday afternoons Mondays I spend as
[2:01:33] many Mondays as possible the same way
[2:01:35] not because I I want a suntan however
[2:01:42] I do believe that everybody
[2:01:45] looks a little better
[2:01:46] where the little Sun
[2:01:50] that's just my humble opinion
[2:01:52] but you won't find me you know I'm not
[2:01:55] sprawled out like a lizard
[2:01:59] turning my foot this way and that way so
[2:02:02] that it can get a suntan
[2:02:07] rolling up things and
[2:02:10] I don't have to do that that's not my
[2:02:12] joy
[2:02:13] my joy is being where the pain is not
[2:02:15] there
[2:02:17] and so please understand that sometimes
[2:02:19] after service I've already stood
[2:02:22] during worship
[2:02:24] and now during the preaching and
[2:02:26] sometime during worship again and
[2:02:27] praying for the sick I can't always do
[2:02:29] it you know why
[2:02:31] because this old creature
[2:02:34] well I heard I heard the preacher say I
[2:02:36] heard Daryl brother Daryl Ward say this
[2:02:38] week we're dying
[2:02:41] he said we're just dying
[2:02:44] brother said the same thing we're dying
[2:02:46] this body that we live in is dying and
[2:02:50] it must happen it must happen has to
[2:02:53] happen we don't like it but thank God it
[2:02:56] don't all happen at one time
[2:02:58] aren't you glad
[2:03:00] that you don't most of the time you
[2:03:03] don't just go from you know great health
[2:03:05] and life lesson uh what they call an
[2:03:07] accident happens or something but but
[2:03:09] you know it's a process of decaying
[2:03:11] thank you Jesus but there is an
[2:03:15] expectation that we have in in this body
[2:03:18] waiting
[2:03:21] oh if I can just find my time if I can
[2:03:24] just press into Christ if I can just
[2:03:26] bury myself in the word if I can just
[2:03:29] let Christ be formed in the belly of my
[2:03:32] spirit hello
[2:03:34] then I'm going to have the manifestation
[2:03:40] of full adoption
[2:03:42] whereby we cry out the father and where
[2:03:46] we show who we are as the sons of God
[2:03:50] named body has to yield to the
[2:03:53] manifestation of the sons of God
[2:03:57] if God could do it for Abraham and Sarah
[2:04:01] he can turn your clock back
[2:04:04] and I'm believing you I'm believing
[2:04:08] I'm not expecting to continue to decline
[2:04:12] I'm expecting to to to climb
[2:04:16] Hallelujah I'm expecting that to close
[2:04:23] Glory
[2:04:25] Hallelujah
[2:04:30] Glory I'm expecting that as we get
[2:04:32] closer and closer to that manifestation
[2:04:34] of the sons of God that even our bodies
[2:04:37] starts obeying our confession because
[2:04:39] we're not speaking in our own authority
[2:04:41] we're speaking in Authority as sons of
[2:04:43] God as Heirs of God as coheirs with
[2:04:46] Jesus Christ anybody with me
[2:04:50] I gotta hurry I I'm I'm on the I'm just
[2:04:53] reading the text
[2:04:54] for the earnest expectation the creature
[2:04:56] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[2:04:58] of God let's go on for for the creature
[2:05:01] was made subject to vanity do you
[2:05:03] believe it not willingly but by reason
[2:05:06] of him who hath subjected the same in
[2:05:08] Hope
[2:05:09] God knew what he was doing
[2:05:12] he's a sovereign-minded god
[2:05:15] because the creature itself also shall
[2:05:17] be delivered
[2:05:20] from the bondage of corruption
[2:05:23] into the glory
[2:05:26] glorious Liberty Hallelujah of the
[2:05:30] children of God how many of you'd like
[2:05:32] to live in the Glorious Liberty of the
[2:05:35] children of God hallelujah I don't mean
[2:05:38] become a religious weirdo I mean just
[2:05:42] manifest Who You Are
[2:05:47] for we know the whole creation not just
[2:05:49] the body all of creation the Earth
[2:05:52] itself the oceans the Seas of the Earth
[2:05:54] the volcanoes
[2:05:56] Hawken and his family just took a 10
[2:05:59] mile hike in to see the
[2:06:02] the volcano that's erupting in Iceland
[2:06:05] I'm going to be having to take my Tour
[2:06:08] on a helicopter
[2:06:14] I don't believe I'm going to be making
[2:06:15] an unless the creature starts
[2:06:18] manifesting who he is in the next few
[2:06:21] weeks I doubt I'm going in because you
[2:06:23] know what I found out about a 10 mile
[2:06:25] hike I took one of you years back you
[2:06:27] know what I found out you got to come
[2:06:28] out
[2:06:31] you can almost always make it crawling
[2:06:34] but then you got to come out
[2:06:36] and by the time I came out of that when
[2:06:38] I couldn't even hardly put my foot down
[2:06:39] to climb down off the trail and so
[2:06:42] anyway uh that volcano that is belching
[2:06:46] itself
[2:06:48] sending that molten lava up into the air
[2:06:53] it's groaning
[2:06:56] it's travailing
[2:06:58] in pain together until now
[2:07:01] did you know that even the earth and the
[2:07:04] surface of the Earth and the crust of
[2:07:05] the Earth the ocean of the earth and the
[2:07:07] underground volcanoes of the earth and
[2:07:10] even underground oceans of the earth
[2:07:11] they are all belching and travailing and
[2:07:14] groaning so that you and I can manifest
[2:07:17] who we are as sons of God do you know
[2:07:19] why because they're looking for somebody
[2:07:21] to have a complete and entire dominion
[2:07:24] over them
[2:07:24] [Applause]
[2:07:26] they were created to be to be dominated
[2:07:29] of in control Adam was placed in the
[2:07:31] earth and he controlled every part of
[2:07:34] creation
[2:07:36] it's been almost six thousand years
[2:07:40] that the Earth has not had that kind of
[2:07:43] authority operating in the earth like
[2:07:45] Adam
[2:07:46] the closest thing and the most powerful
[2:07:49] thing that happened was two thousand
[2:07:50] years ago the Creator came down in a
[2:07:53] body of flesh but he didn't come for the
[2:07:54] purpose of having dominion over all the
[2:07:56] elements he came for the purpose of
[2:07:58] becoming the sinless Spotless lamb who
[2:08:01] was crucified and shed his life's blood
[2:08:03] so that you and I could be redeemed are
[2:08:06] you with me
[2:08:07] but we have got so much to look forward
[2:08:10] to I've got to hurry now
[2:08:13] hmm
[2:08:16] and not only they
[2:08:18] but ourselves also which have the first
[2:08:21] fruits of the spirit that's me
[2:08:24] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[2:08:29] hallelujah
[2:08:31] oh help me Lord oh I need you Jesus
[2:08:37] I find myself many many times
[2:08:41] oh Jesus I Need You Lord
[2:08:44] I've got to have you Lord
[2:08:47] I need you more today than I did
[2:08:50] yesterday
[2:08:51] oh God I need you Lord I need you Lord I
[2:08:55] I want you I don't just need you I want
[2:08:59] you I want who you are I want you to be
[2:09:03] real in my life
[2:09:05] and that's what the Apostle said even we
[2:09:07] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[2:09:10] for the adoption to wit the Redemption
[2:09:13] of our body our Inner Man coming to the
[2:09:16] Abba Father Spirit of adoption now he's
[2:09:19] talking about a time when our physical
[2:09:21] bodies will give way and that Spirit of
[2:09:24] adoption will even bring the molecules
[2:09:26] of our flesh into perfect
[2:09:28] synchronization with the word of God
[2:09:32] no disease can live in a body like that
[2:09:35] hello
[2:09:37] you really believe there's going to be a
[2:09:40] diseaseless body in the earth before the
[2:09:42] rat oh yes I do it will be part of the
[2:09:45] quick short work you may only have 30 to
[2:09:48] 40 days to enjoy that kind of Health
[2:09:52] but then you'll have eternity
[2:09:56] I can get a lot done I don't know about
[2:09:58] you but in a painless body
[2:10:02] where the Holy Ghost charge in every
[2:10:04] cell of my body I could get a whole lot
[2:10:06] done in one month
[2:10:09] Hallelujah I could call a lot of
[2:10:12] resurrections out in one I'm just giving
[2:10:15] you what he said
[2:10:16] I'm only trying to make it practical
[2:10:21] a storm try to come up and stop the
[2:10:23] bride's Revival oh no
[2:10:29] a tumor try to crop up in your body when
[2:10:32] you're in that oh no
[2:10:35] I speak you out I command you to go
[2:10:39] [Applause]
[2:10:41] can you imagine a cancer-free Zone if
[2:10:44] only for 30 to 40 days
[2:10:48] where the bride does not did you know
[2:10:50] that every one most every one of us in
[2:10:52] this room have mutated cells in our body
[2:10:55] right now that if they continue to
[2:10:58] divide as they are they are cancerous
[2:11:01] cells
[2:11:02] did you know that your immune system
[2:11:04] defeats cancer in your body on a daily
[2:11:07] basis
[2:11:08] it arrests the cells and that's why
[2:11:10] there are amazing things that you can do
[2:11:13] for yourself
[2:11:15] to help your DNA
[2:11:19] and to help your body heal itself on a
[2:11:22] cellular level
[2:11:24] so that you have the strength to
[2:11:26] continue to fight off mutation
[2:11:29] when your body sees the cell mutating in
[2:11:32] the wrong way it sins white blood cells
[2:11:36] its sins other chemicals and chemistries
[2:11:39] of the body to go and start killing that
[2:11:42] cell off
[2:11:44] but if your immune system cannot fight
[2:11:46] that then it continues to multiply
[2:11:48] depending on what kind of mutation it is
[2:11:50] and you all know they're faster growing
[2:11:52] and slower growing kinds of cancer do
[2:11:55] not fear cancer
[2:11:57] you cannot fear it and that's why I'm
[2:11:59] here to tell you it's it's happening
[2:12:03] it's happening in these old bodies cells
[2:12:06] are mutating but we're going to come to
[2:12:08] an hour
[2:12:10] where every cell that multiplies in our
[2:12:13] body is perfect and whole somebody said
[2:12:15] I don't want anybody to hear that we
[2:12:16] believe this well don't tell them
[2:12:20] I just happen to believe the God who did
[2:12:22] it the first time can do it again
[2:12:25] I just happen to believe Jesus Christ
[2:12:27] the same yesterday and today and forever
[2:12:30] and I happen to believe all of that
[2:12:31] makes up a part of the full
[2:12:33] manifestations of the sons of God the
[2:12:35] fullness of the spirit of adoption the
[2:12:37] bride's Revival the fullness of the
[2:12:38] third pool we could go on and on the
[2:12:40] coming of the Capstone all the things
[2:12:43] that we have
[2:12:44] yeah come on
[2:12:47] I happen to believe that it really
[2:12:49] happens
[2:12:51] I happen to believe we don't just talk
[2:12:53] about being in it for 50 years
[2:12:56] and we can't even produce enough
[2:12:57] religion to get our teenagers prayed
[2:12:59] through
[2:13:01] [Applause]
[2:13:02] I'm talking about a time where we have
[2:13:04] the goods
[2:13:05] God will see to that
[2:13:07] you and I are in the process of getting
[2:13:09] all the junk out now
[2:13:12] so that he can come in and have his way
[2:13:14] and not only they but ourselves which
[2:13:16] are the first fruits all right let's go
[2:13:18] on Are we almost to the end
[2:13:24] next verse is that the last what verse
[2:13:27] was that when the verses aren't on there
[2:13:29] I have no idea what verse we're reading
[2:13:31] that was verse 23 so we
[2:13:34] no
[2:13:36] that wasn't 23
[2:13:39] what verse was it again tell me
[2:13:43] oh sorry
[2:13:45] my page turned
[2:13:47] forgive me
[2:13:50] praise God
[2:13:57] Hallelujah
[2:13:58] we're done with that
[2:14:03] turn to Matthew
[2:14:05] chapter one oh it's ten after one we
[2:14:08] have lots of time
[2:14:10] I'm just rushing here we have lots of
[2:14:12] time
[2:14:13] didn't seem like you were Russian pastor
[2:14:16] I was
[2:14:18] King James and Jacob begat Joseph
[2:14:21] the husband of Mary
[2:14:23] of whom was born Jesus who is called
[2:14:28] Christos Christos
[2:14:32] Christos in English it's Christ in Greek
[2:14:36] it's Christos
[2:14:38] it means the anointed one
[2:14:42] when we read in the Old Testament as we
[2:14:45] did in Psalm 2
[2:14:47] the anointed or his anointed
[2:14:50] the word is the mashiach or the Messiah
[2:14:54] the the Messiah means the anointed one
[2:14:57] Christos Christ is the anointed one so
[2:15:02] of whom was born Jesus who is called
[2:15:05] Messiah
[2:15:07] mashiach
[2:15:08] Christos Christ the anointed one he is
[2:15:13] the Messiah he is the anointed one and
[2:15:17] so when we read Christ we can read the
[2:15:21] word Messiah
[2:15:23] it is the equivalent
[2:15:25] of the Hebrew word mashiach
[2:15:29] in the Amplified it tells us that I want
[2:15:33] to read it to show you how the Amplified
[2:15:34] will do sometime to really help you with
[2:15:37] it with the full meaning of a word
[2:15:39] Jacob the father of Joseph the husband
[2:15:42] of Mary of whom was born Jesus who is
[2:15:45] called the Christ the Messiah the
[2:15:49] anointed
[2:15:51] in Luke chapter 2 verse 11 King James
[2:15:56] For unto you is Born This Day in the
[2:15:59] city of David a savior which is Christos
[2:16:04] Christ the anointed one the Messiah the
[2:16:08] Lord
[2:16:10] we could say Messiah or we could say uh
[2:16:16] who is which is mashiach
[2:16:20] Adonai
[2:16:23] Lord is Adonai in Hebrew so if you hear
[2:16:27] someone say bashem it means in the name
[2:16:30] bashem
[2:16:32] Adonai Lord
[2:16:36] Yeshua Jesus Son
[2:16:39] Christ Christos the anointed one
[2:16:43] so to say Lord Jesus Christ
[2:16:47] is to say the name of the father Lord
[2:16:49] Adonai the son Jesus
[2:16:53] Christ the anointed one or the anointing
[2:16:56] which is the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit
[2:16:58] how many of you understand that and
[2:17:01] that's why brother Branham said we don't
[2:17:02] baptize in Jesus name only
[2:17:07] because there may be many jesuses but
[2:17:10] there's only one Lord Jesus Christ
[2:17:12] Adonai Yeshua hamashiach Lord Jesus
[2:17:16] Christ father son and
[2:17:19] the Bible said in the father this is New
[2:17:21] Testament now and the father hath chosen
[2:17:23] him
[2:17:24] and highly exalted him and given him a
[2:17:27] name that is above every name that at
[2:17:30] the name of Jesus every knee should bow
[2:17:33] and every tongue should confess these
[2:17:36] are not teachings that we have pulled
[2:17:37] out of our ears
[2:17:40] these are years and years and years of
[2:17:44] studying the scripture and receiving
[2:17:46] Revelation by the Holy Spirit
[2:17:49] if it lines up with the Bible it doesn't
[2:17:52] matter whether it lines up with
[2:17:54] Grandma's religion or not if it lines up
[2:17:57] with the word
[2:17:59] you see we're not basing what we preach
[2:18:02] on the Apostles Creed
[2:18:05] we're not basing it on the Roman
[2:18:07] Catholic church or system
[2:18:09] we're basing it on the absolute written
[2:18:12] record of the word amen and I think you
[2:18:15] know that I believe you know that there
[2:18:18] are many
[2:18:19] Orthodox doctrines of the church
[2:18:23] that cannot even be found in the Holy
[2:18:25] Scripture
[2:18:26] for instance Holy Trinity is mentioned
[2:18:29] nowhere not one single solitary place in
[2:18:35] the Bible
[2:18:37] the word doesn't appear and did you know
[2:18:39] that even extreme trinitarians I read
[2:18:42] some articles recently where extreme
[2:18:44] trinitarians who actually believe in
[2:18:46] three gods
[2:18:48] did you know there are some most
[2:18:50] believed that the Trinity is made up of
[2:18:54] three
[2:18:55] distinct
[2:18:57] and
[2:18:58] eternal
[2:18:59] persons
[2:19:02] now that Eternal gets me
[2:19:04] because you can't be an eternal son
[2:19:07] and the three persons is what we have
[2:19:11] oppose not you you could even you know
[2:19:14] if you really needed uh some description
[2:19:16] you could even say personality now I
[2:19:20] don't like to say that because when we
[2:19:22] think of Personality we think of what a
[2:19:24] person
[2:19:25] but you could look at it as a
[2:19:27] demonstration or you could look at it as
[2:19:29] an office but did you know there's not
[2:19:31] one single verse in the New Testament
[2:19:33] where all three are mentioned as three
[2:19:35] distinct persons or three distinct
[2:19:37] individuals at all it's just simply not
[2:19:40] there but doesn't the church teach that
[2:19:42] at large yes and have since 325.
[2:19:46] somewhere between 150 and 250 A.D the
[2:19:51] first writings appeared using the word
[2:19:53] Trinity
[2:19:54] so I just thought you might find it
[2:19:56] interesting that for a hundred years
[2:19:58] nobody even used the word and it was not
[2:20:01] until 325 A.D that that writings begin
[2:20:04] to appear and the church adopted such a
[2:20:07] concept of God and they they confess in
[2:20:10] the early writings of the church fathers
[2:20:12] which I have read by the way and it's
[2:20:14] some of the most boring reading that
[2:20:16] you'll ever do you have to skip to some
[2:20:18] interesting places but you will find
[2:20:20] that they said that the concept of three
[2:20:23] persons in the godhead was birthed out
[2:20:26] of the many pagans
[2:20:29] who were coming through Rome to the
[2:20:31] church who had been worshiping hundreds
[2:20:35] pluralities of Gods
[2:20:38] and so when they tried to explain who
[2:20:40] God was they could not explain him in
[2:20:43] the in the biblical sense of one spirit
[2:20:45] and so they chose this this description
[2:20:48] of persons which is very very confusing
[2:20:52] to many people and even articles of
[2:20:55] extreme trinitarians that I read
[2:20:57] recently say things like this there is
[2:20:59] no a clear indication of the Holy
[2:21:03] Trinity mentioned anywhere in the New
[2:21:06] Testament these are trinitarians saying
[2:21:07] this do you know what they say next it
[2:21:10] is only implied
[2:21:16] implied
[2:21:18] now you're going to base your whole
[2:21:20] belief system
[2:21:22] on implication
[2:21:24] I thought we were here
[2:21:26] to read the absolute
[2:21:29] I'm I'm just trying to help you I
[2:21:31] thought the word of God was to be the
[2:21:33] absolute I didn't know that we had to
[2:21:35] follow it by by implications
[2:21:38] I thought the Holy Spirit had come to
[2:21:41] make that word so real that nothing had
[2:21:44] to be implied or assumed
[2:21:47] it's got to line up
[2:21:49] may God help us all because we have to
[2:21:52] learn I didn't know it I did not know it
[2:21:55] God had to deal with my heart it's been
[2:21:57] a long journey it's been a 30 uh plus
[2:22:01] year
[2:22:02] 1988 when God began to reveal the truth
[2:22:05] from the scripture concerning the
[2:22:08] godhead 1988 that's a long time and you
[2:22:12] know what I hadn't quitting I hadn't
[2:22:13] quit studying it
[2:22:15] I look at it often because I want to
[2:22:19] make these scriptures come alive when we
[2:22:22] read them and look at them together
[2:22:24] for for under you is Born This Day in
[2:22:27] the city of David a savior which is
[2:22:29] mashiach Adonai Christ the lord let's
[2:22:33] look at the Amplified for to you is Born
[2:22:36] This Day in the town of David a savior
[2:22:39] who is Christ the Messiah the Lord
[2:22:44] so Webster defines Messiah as a title
[2:22:50] given to the promised deliverer of the
[2:22:55] Jewish Nation as prophesied in the
[2:22:58] Hebrew Bible did you follow that
[2:23:00] Messiah is derived or mashiach in Hebrew
[2:23:04] is derived from the Hebrew word excuse
[2:23:07] me sorry messiah in English is derived
[2:23:10] from the Hebrew word mashiach which
[2:23:13] means anointed one and which corresponds
[2:23:17] to the New Testament title of Christ
[2:23:20] which is Christos or anointed the
[2:23:25] anointed one anointed of what
[2:23:29] of the Holy Spirit
[2:23:32] who is God
[2:23:34] I will not leave you
[2:23:36] I will come to you now uh I want to want
[2:23:41] you to understand this morning that we
[2:23:43] are going to make some quotations here
[2:23:45] before we go
[2:23:46] and this is kind of what I struggle with
[2:23:49] because I don't want anyone I think most
[2:23:52] of you know where we stand but I don't
[2:23:55] want anyone to think that I am trying to
[2:23:57] introduce to you the things that brother
[2:23:59] Branham said as extra biblical or
[2:24:02] entirely equal
[2:24:04] to the Bible
[2:24:08] now I know there are people who believe
[2:24:10] that it is entirely in its entirety
[2:24:15] equal to the scripture
[2:24:17] I can't believe that because in order to
[2:24:21] do that I would have to call them both
[2:24:23] absolute
[2:24:25] and there has to be one absolute and
[2:24:28] everything else has to base on that or
[2:24:31] lay on the foundation of that absolute
[2:24:33] so I'm not presenting these quotes
[2:24:35] to introduce to you something extra
[2:24:37] biblical as some might assume I'm doing
[2:24:41] it to help you understand that that God
[2:24:44] desired for you and I to be able to
[2:24:47] understand the scripture and sometimes
[2:24:49] we just needed somebody who'd tie one
[2:24:51] scripture with the next and we say I got
[2:24:53] it
[2:24:54] that's really what preaching does
[2:24:56] preaching is foolishness
[2:24:58] it seems so foolish to have to get up
[2:25:01] and scream
[2:25:03] [Music]
[2:25:07] but God chose the foolishness of
[2:25:10] preaching
[2:25:11] to deliver the word of God to them that
[2:25:14] believe
[2:25:15] don't you see that
[2:25:16] and so unless I get up here and the only
[2:25:19] thing I do is read the scripture I could
[2:25:21] do that
[2:25:23] I could stand up here for two hours and
[2:25:25] just read the Bible
[2:25:27] but we wouldn't always come to a closer
[2:25:29] understanding of what we had read
[2:25:31] we needed some help
[2:25:33] and God promised him the scripture that
[2:25:36] he would send the help we need
[2:25:38] aren't you glad he did
[2:25:40] the spoken word is the Original Seed
[2:25:43] paragraph 204 so this is presented as
[2:25:47] something that we can lay in the
[2:25:49] absolute
[2:25:51] this is to me if it says the same thing
[2:25:54] if it is saying the same thing that the
[2:25:57] word says then it becomes a part of the
[2:26:00] absolute
[2:26:02] if I get up here today and I preach to
[2:26:05] you what the word of God says I'm
[2:26:09] delivering to you the absolute
[2:26:12] if I give you my opinion then that's not
[2:26:15] the absolute
[2:26:16] if I give you my supposition or what I
[2:26:19] think it might be that's not the
[2:26:21] absolute but if I take the scripture and
[2:26:23] break it down and give you only the word
[2:26:26] with some understanding of that word
[2:26:29] then we could say that also is the
[2:26:32] absolute
[2:26:34] because
[2:26:35] it's based on the word of God I hope
[2:26:39] that helps somebody
[2:26:40] what was he
[2:26:42] he made himself a man
[2:26:46] God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[2:26:48] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[2:26:51] us remember last week John 1 God's
[2:26:54] spoken word through a virgin brought
[2:26:59] forth a body you believe that don't you
[2:27:02] the Bible said Mary was overshadowed by
[2:27:05] the father
[2:27:07] the scripture said by the Holy Spirit
[2:27:09] which is the eternal spirit of the
[2:27:12] father and in that body
[2:27:17] Washed by the Water of the word follow
[2:27:21] this can you give me my time
[2:27:23] and then with him went in him dwelt in
[2:27:26] him and there come the life of God
[2:27:30] manifesting himself through Christ God
[2:27:34] was in Christ Messiah the anointed one
[2:27:37] do you understand that that's all I
[2:27:39] tried to read all those verses for was
[2:27:41] to help you see that's what the word
[2:27:43] says Christ means the anointed one a man
[2:27:47] that was anointed and God dwelling in
[2:27:50] him can you agree with that
[2:27:53] who was it
[2:27:54] The Germ with the flesh
[2:27:58] the anointed one meaning the seed of God
[2:28:02] with flesh on it now
[2:28:04] flesh being Anointed with the spirit of
[2:28:09] God produced whoa
[2:28:17] this is telling us about him
[2:28:19] but somehow my little faith is putting
[2:28:24] myself in here too
[2:28:27] because read the way look at the way it
[2:28:29] was read flesh I got flesh anybody got
[2:28:33] flesh
[2:28:35] being Anointed with the spirit of God
[2:28:37] anybody got anointed by the spirit of
[2:28:39] God produce what
[2:28:42] the word of God made manifest or as we
[2:28:44] preached last Sunday the word of God
[2:28:46] made flesh and we beheld him the only
[2:28:48] begotten of the father full of grace see
[2:28:50] now it becometh us to
[2:28:53] righteousness paragraph 88 and I got to
[2:28:56] go quick so that we don't have to be
[2:28:57] here all morning all day all afternoon
[2:29:01] Aaron the high priest before he could
[2:29:03] ever be anointed he had to be washed
[2:29:05] with water don't you love that before he
[2:29:08] could ever go into the holy Place
[2:29:10] receive the anointing and service and
[2:29:12] Minister unto the Lord he had to wash in
[2:29:14] the Holy labor right according to the
[2:29:16] Old Testament so then how could we come
[2:29:19] along and say the Old Testament is
[2:29:20] obsolete
[2:29:23] you see I can take this statement made
[2:29:27] by a man
[2:29:29] under the inspiration and unction of the
[2:29:32] Holy Spirit I can take that word all the
[2:29:35] way back to both the New Testament and
[2:29:37] the Old Testament and show you where
[2:29:39] that is a word based statement
[2:29:42] Aaron the high priest and the priest who
[2:29:43] followed him in the aaronic order they
[2:29:45] had to be
[2:29:49] one for he could be anointed our high
[2:29:52] priest
[2:29:55] he was washed with water
[2:29:57] let's go on
[2:29:59] and then that anointing oil poured upon
[2:30:02] him to anoint him like Aaron was
[2:30:05] anointed with oil he was anointed with
[2:30:08] the Holy Ghost can anybody tell me when
[2:30:10] he was anointed with water
[2:30:14] at his baptism
[2:30:16] uh let's go on
[2:30:19] for John bear records seeing the spirit
[2:30:22] of God descending like a dove and going
[2:30:25] upon him and a voice say this is my oh
[2:30:28] they say wait a minute there's two to
[2:30:31] what
[2:30:34] there's a voice
[2:30:36] and a person
[2:30:39] not two people
[2:30:42] a voice
[2:30:43] God is a spirit
[2:30:46] the Bible says I'm not making that up
[2:30:48] God is a spirit and they that worship
[2:30:50] Him must
[2:30:53] he doesn't have a physical form
[2:30:56] unless he comes in the Sun
[2:31:00] he may appear as a fire pillar of fires
[2:31:02] the anointing remember last week he may
[2:31:04] come as a pillar of fire he may come as
[2:31:06] a rainbow he may come as a cloud he may
[2:31:09] come as an angel
[2:31:11] but the spirit of the father has no
[2:31:14] physical body of his own but he has a
[2:31:16] voice
[2:31:16] [Music]
[2:31:18] the spirit has a voice and the voice
[2:31:21] spoke out this is my beloved Son in whom
[2:31:24] I am pleased to dwell so the Bible said
[2:31:27] Jesus was anointed with the Holy Ghost
[2:31:31] went about doing good things
[2:31:35] so now we have two scripture we have the
[2:31:37] baptism and we have the scripture that
[2:31:39] says he was anointed with the Holy Ghost
[2:31:40] and went about doing good things see he
[2:31:44] was anointed if he was anointed what
[2:31:46] does that make him
[2:31:47] the Messiah
[2:31:49] someone say the Messiah
[2:31:52] the mashiach can you say that mashiach
[2:31:56] mashiach
[2:31:58] there you go
[2:32:00] you'd make good Jews or Germans
[2:32:04] if you can get that
[2:32:08] before he was anointed before he was
[2:32:11] anointed
[2:32:12] he had to
[2:32:15] you see that's what come down in the
[2:32:17] form of a dove
[2:32:18] that was the anointing
[2:32:22] it was God coming down the form of Dove
[2:32:25] to anoint him why because he had been
[2:32:27] washed in the water
[2:32:29] every offering not only did the priest
[2:32:31] have to be washed in the water did you
[2:32:33] know that every offering had to be
[2:32:34] washed every lamb had to be washed every
[2:32:36] offering had to be washed and anointed
[2:32:39] and here we have Jesus fulfilling the
[2:32:41] very righteousness of the law before he
[2:32:44] was anointed he had to fulfill all
[2:32:45] righteousness see he had to be washed
[2:32:47] with water before the anointing could
[2:32:49] come upon him isn't that powerful in
[2:32:52] that powerful don't let that stumble you
[2:32:55] he was the anointing he was the word
[2:32:58] made flesh but once you put the word in
[2:33:00] a fleshly body you have condescended you
[2:33:03] brought the word down and that word
[2:33:05] again had to be anointed had to be
[2:33:07] washed in water and had to be anointed
[2:33:09] by the Holy Spirit
[2:33:11] Hallelujah so that it could be equal to
[2:33:13] God
[2:33:16] that physical body I don't want to
[2:33:18] confuse you
[2:33:20] but that physical body was not equal to
[2:33:22] God
[2:33:27] see he had to be washed with water
[2:33:28] before the anointing come upon him
[2:33:31] and it's a very beautiful type of us
[2:33:33] today hey
[2:33:38] let's go on paragraph 91. and it's a
[2:33:41] very beautiful type of us today as
[2:33:43] priests unto God we must be first
[2:33:45] baptized have you been baptized have you
[2:33:49] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:33:50] Jesus Christ did you know if you've not
[2:33:53] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:33:54] Jesus Christ you ought to
[2:33:57] because in doing so you may open up your
[2:34:00] life to the anointing
[2:34:02] and the anointing will open your eyes
[2:34:04] and let you see the reality of the word
[2:34:07] without baptism you've not been properly
[2:34:10] washed
[2:34:11] just throwing that out there we know
[2:34:14] it's an internal washing of the water of
[2:34:16] the word but we also know that that the
[2:34:19] whole reason why we have the external
[2:34:21] demonstration of water baptism is to
[2:34:24] fulfill all righteousness according to
[2:34:26] the law and that we're washing the
[2:34:28] sacrifice we're getting ready for the
[2:34:30] anointing to fall on it no wonder Peter
[2:34:32] said repent and be baptized every one of
[2:34:34] you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[2:34:35] remission of your sins and you shall
[2:34:37] receive the anointing and you shall
[2:34:39] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost isn't
[2:34:41] that powerful not many days from now
[2:34:43] all right so uh see wash first and then
[2:34:47] anointed for service no Minister should
[2:34:50] enter that Pulpit without first being
[2:34:52] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:34:54] because all remission of sins is only in
[2:34:57] Jesus Christ's name no not another name
[2:35:00] under Heaven given among men now if I
[2:35:03] didn't believe that was a word based
[2:35:05] statement I wouldn't be reading it here
[2:35:06] today
[2:35:14] I want you to understand that
[2:35:17] there are a few statements on the tapes
[2:35:21] that I believe are misspoken
[2:35:24] and I Don't Preach those quotes
[2:35:27] because I can't take them back to the
[2:35:30] Bible
[2:35:32] you understand I'm not saying it's not
[2:35:35] true I'm just saying it it seems to be
[2:35:38] misspoken because it doesn't line up
[2:35:40] with the word oh you're just trying to
[2:35:41] point out the mistake oh to the contrary
[2:35:45] I've defended this word as much as
[2:35:47] anyone in this room
[2:35:49] I wouldn't begin to unravel it now
[2:35:52] but I have an obligation
[2:35:54] to stay with the book
[2:35:57] and you do too so if I didn't believe
[2:35:59] that this was based right on the
[2:36:01] absolute word of God I wouldn't be
[2:36:03] presenting in here this morning
[2:36:04] amen
[2:36:06] so repentance and remission of sin must
[2:36:09] be taught in his name beginning at
[2:36:11] Jerusalem that's where the Holy Ghost
[2:36:13] fell and anointed first so a minister or
[2:36:16] any believer must first be washed from
[2:36:19] his sins in the name of Jesus Christ and
[2:36:21] the anointing with the Holy Ghost to
[2:36:24] bring forth a testimony for God
[2:36:27] see that now another sirs we would see
[2:36:30] Jesus paragraph 26 oh I wish you can
[2:36:34] stay can you stay a few more can you
[2:36:36] stay a little bit longer notice the
[2:36:38] first thing he did after his temptation
[2:36:40] in the wilderness he came forth as the
[2:36:43] anointed Messiah the Messiah the Messiah
[2:36:47] the Christ Christ means the anointed one
[2:36:50] he was born Jesus the man or we could
[2:36:53] say Yeshua his Hebrew name but when the
[2:36:56] Holy Ghost came into him he was the
[2:36:59] anointed Messiah
[2:37:02] always the word made flesh
[2:37:05] but until the Holy Ghost came on him
[2:37:09] not the anointed Messiah can you follow
[2:37:12] that the Bible said in this to me oh my
[2:37:16] this settled so many questions the Bible
[2:37:19] said God was in Christ
[2:37:22] reconciling himself to the world
[2:37:29] oh how could he be any lesser God
[2:37:33] if God was in him reconciling himself to
[2:37:37] The World God living in him
[2:37:40] fullness of
[2:37:43] this of The Sinner Christ
[2:37:45] poured all he was into the church this
[2:37:49] is in Tifton Georgia my my right down
[2:37:52] the road
[2:37:53] on the day of Pentecost when they were
[2:37:55] assembled together when that Pillar of
[2:37:57] Fire came down it divided with cloven
[2:37:59] tongues and sat upon each of them
[2:38:01] showing that God was dividing himself
[2:38:07] among the people
[2:38:10] now I only want to read uh sweetheart I
[2:38:13] only want to read and that's not charity
[2:38:15] I'm talking to she's not up there
[2:38:18] uh a paragraph 110. I only want to read
[2:38:20] 110 of questions and answers number two
[2:38:22] I read this last week but I didn't I
[2:38:26] don't know that I come all the way to
[2:38:27] the end so I just want to read last
[2:38:28] paragraph and I'm moving on best I can
[2:38:32] now this logos that was in him which was
[2:38:38] the spirit of God the anointing through
[2:38:41] the sanctifying grace of the blood
[2:38:44] brought many sons to God do you believe
[2:38:47] that which is Anointed with this
[2:38:51] is every son Anointed with the same
[2:38:53] logos that's what he's telling us that's
[2:38:56] what the word says
[2:38:58] is that right now I want you to go to a
[2:39:01] scripture with me for just a moment
[2:39:03] first John everybody okay
[2:39:06] and also we're working a little at it
[2:39:08] but that's all right
[2:39:09] first John 2 27 through 29 but the I
[2:39:15] want you to listen for because I want
[2:39:17] you to see you
[2:39:20] but the anointing
[2:39:22] which ye have received of him
[2:39:26] abideth
[2:39:28] in you
[2:39:33] and ye need not that any man teach you
[2:39:37] but as the same anointing teaching you
[2:39:41] teacheth you of all things and is truth
[2:39:44] and is no lie and even as it hath taught
[2:39:47] you ye shall abide in him you've got to
[2:39:51] be anointed you need to be water
[2:39:53] baptized washed and cleansed you need to
[2:39:57] repent of your sins and have your sins
[2:39:59] covered by the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:40:01] then you need that anointing that comes
[2:40:04] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost if
[2:40:06] you don't have the genuine baptism of
[2:40:09] the Holy Ghost you cannot interpret the
[2:40:11] word of God for yourself
[2:40:15] you've got to have the ice have
[2:40:18] you've got to have the Revelation that
[2:40:21] comes when the anointing falls on you
[2:40:23] what is the anointing he said it was the
[2:40:25] same logos
[2:40:27] that was on Christ Jesus I don't know
[2:40:30] why some of you look a little confused
[2:40:32] and you you are normally right with me
[2:40:35] so I hope I if you've if you've heard me
[2:40:38] misspeak please tell me if I did say a
[2:40:40] little something that sometimes I do
[2:40:43] that if I misspoke please correct me now
[2:40:45] or help me uh text me or something if I
[2:40:49] said something in a wrong order or
[2:40:51] something I'm certainly human and I
[2:40:53] might have done it I'm trying to
[2:40:54] understand why some look a little lost
[2:40:58] because I hadn't gotten to nothing yet
[2:41:02] I feel like I'm still in the ABCs
[2:41:05] and now little children abide in him
[2:41:08] oh I love that word
[2:41:11] abide
[2:41:13] and we will make our abode
[2:41:16] with him it's easy to abide in him when
[2:41:19] he has made his Abode in you you get it
[2:41:23] you get it and now little children abide
[2:41:25] in him remain in him
[2:41:29] can I tell you something it's not
[2:41:32] automatic
[2:41:34] abiding in him requires something
[2:41:38] it's a cooperation it's a participation
[2:41:42] it's not automatic abide in him that
[2:41:45] when he shall appear we may have
[2:41:47] confidence and not be ashamed before him
[2:41:49] at his coming let me tell you something
[2:41:51] God has made a way so that when he comes
[2:41:54] nobody will have to run and hide like
[2:41:56] Adam did
[2:41:59] you'll be able to step out in the
[2:42:00] clearing and say Here I Am Lord
[2:42:05] not because you did any good or I did
[2:42:08] any good but because the way has been
[2:42:10] made
[2:42:11] God came in Christ reconciling us to
[2:42:14] himself if ye know that he is righteous
[2:42:16] you know that everyone that doeth
[2:42:17] righteousness is born of him are we
[2:42:21] there hallelujah it's a very a very
[2:42:24] important verse of scripture but but in
[2:42:27] verse 27 right back to the beginning
[2:42:29] let's look at it again he said but the
[2:42:32] anointing which ye have received of him
[2:42:34] abideth in you now that word anointing
[2:42:37] is charisma Charisma not not Charisma
[2:42:40] the name of a magazine charisma
[2:42:43] it's a Greek word it means unction it
[2:42:46] means anointing
[2:42:47] it also means to smear oil
[2:42:54] you know you don't just need a drop on
[2:42:55] your forehead
[2:42:57] you need an anointing that rubs that oil
[2:43:00] that a holy anointing it rubs it past
[2:43:04] the flesh past the emotion
[2:43:07] right down into the to the inner Spirit
[2:43:09] of man that's what we've got to have is
[2:43:12] that right
[2:43:14] do you know what else it means anointing
[2:43:16] Charisma but the anointing but the
[2:43:20] Charisma which ye have received of him
[2:43:22] abideth in you it also means the
[2:43:25] reception of spiritual privileges
[2:43:28] it also means a supernatural sanction
[2:43:32] I'm reading it from the Lexicon
[2:43:35] that's not a leprechaun
[2:43:37] that's a lexicon it's the word we use
[2:43:41] it's a Greek dictionary that will tell
[2:43:44] us what Greek word is used for every
[2:43:47] word in the New Testament and what it
[2:43:49] means
[2:43:50] in the reception of spiritual privileges
[2:43:52] it also means a supernatural sanction
[2:43:56] as though a voice saying this one is
[2:44:00] mine
[2:44:01] so when the verse said but the anointing
[2:44:03] which you have received of him abideth
[2:44:05] in you that anointing that's being
[2:44:07] described is a blessing it's an
[2:44:09] endowment it's a supernatural sanction
[2:44:12] from on high it's an unction
[2:44:15] it's the very same concept that causes
[2:44:19] us to call Christ
[2:44:21] the anointed one
[2:44:24] and what is the other word the Old
[2:44:26] Testament word we use for the anointed
[2:44:28] one Messiah
[2:44:30] mashiach
[2:44:32] once he was anointed he became the
[2:44:35] anointed Messiah
[2:44:37] or the mashiach is that right
[2:44:40] now what about you
[2:44:46] what about you
[2:44:52] in the message the Messiah
[2:44:55] Shreveport Louisiana
[2:44:58] the time that I have left I'm going to
[2:45:00] be reading from this message
[2:45:02] I encourage you to hear it
[2:45:09] I
[2:45:10] I probably should have just let them
[2:45:12] pull it up and play that little portion
[2:45:14] for you instead of me reading it
[2:45:17] he wouldn't have been distracted he'd
[2:45:19] have stayed or I don't text
[2:45:22] now we're made up of light meters
[2:45:26] inside of us is Cosmic light
[2:45:30] now that Cosmic light is a light that
[2:45:33] they can take an x-ray with
[2:45:36] the X-ray doesn't come from the X-ray
[2:45:39] light it comes from your own light
[2:45:46] you're seeing a picture of you're seeing
[2:45:49] a negative
[2:45:50] when you see an x-ray
[2:45:52] when they put the X-ray up on the screen
[2:45:54] there you're seeing a negative that
[2:45:57] means it has struck the positive
[2:45:59] that's what the prophet is telling us
[2:46:01] that bone there that white thing is is
[2:46:05] your body testifying to that machine
[2:46:08] that you're you've got something on the
[2:46:10] inside of you
[2:46:12] now if if that Cosmic light say could be
[2:46:16] pushed into a place where no no not
[2:46:20] Cosmic light but Eternal Light God could
[2:46:24] dwell supremely to do our thinking do
[2:46:27] our walking do our talking then it's no
[2:46:30] longer the man
[2:46:31] read it
[2:46:33] it's God in the man
[2:46:35] what does that sound like to you
[2:46:37] adoption sons of God
[2:46:40] full adoption sons of God the word made
[2:46:43] flesh are you with me
[2:46:46] he said I suppose I'm deafening You by
[2:46:48] this thing because I hear it rebound
[2:46:50] it's got an awful voice it isn't me is
[2:46:53] it it's this now now see lay it on that
[2:46:55] uh he's got life eternal life it's the
[2:46:59] light of God that dwells in the man and
[2:47:02] if he will yield to the spirit more
[2:47:05] he becomes unmanned
[2:47:09] sinner like
[2:47:10] and becomes more
[2:47:14] don't let that disturb you
[2:47:18] you do remember what Jesus said to the
[2:47:20] Pharisees don't you
[2:47:23] your law says
[2:47:26] that men are Gods little G
[2:47:31] you're disturbed because I tell you I'm
[2:47:33] the Son of God or because something like
[2:47:35] that has been your your scripture says
[2:47:39] ye are gods
[2:47:41] when it speaks of the prophets this is
[2:47:43] what Jesus said that's red letter
[2:47:45] so don't let this little simple Kentucky
[2:47:47] English disturb you because this is a
[2:47:50] great truth based solely on the Bible he
[2:47:54] said here not long ago they took an
[2:47:55] x-ray of a man praying for a sick man
[2:47:57] Reader's Digest wrote it up and found
[2:48:00] out a ray of light coming from one of
[2:48:02] the men not all of them but one of the
[2:48:04] man's hands reflected a ray of light
[2:48:09] when they put a piece of lead foil
[2:48:11] beneath the man's hand I guess you read
[2:48:13] it yourself I read it yourself
[2:48:16] it's gone in England they turned the
[2:48:18] healers they call them loose to all the
[2:48:21] hospitals and there was 80 percent more
[2:48:23] healing done by Divine Healing
[2:48:27] then medical cures had performed Readers
[2:48:30] Digest picked it up over here that was
[2:48:31] in Newsweek and readers died just picked
[2:48:34] it up and tried it
[2:48:36] and they find that there is a ray of
[2:48:38] light
[2:48:39] when this man sincerely not knowing they
[2:48:42] were doing it put his hands upon a man
[2:48:43] and prayed and Earnest prayer they was
[2:48:46] putting the X-ray down and found out a
[2:48:48] light was coming from his hand that was
[2:48:50] Cosmic light that was eternal light that
[2:48:53] was God's light
[2:48:55] you're supposed to be he tells us
[2:48:57] hundreds of times you're supposed to be
[2:49:00] the light in the darkness that little
[2:49:02] church bride that little bride is
[2:49:03] supposed to be the light in the Darkness
[2:49:06] now God knew what he talked about when
[2:49:08] he said lay hands on the sick and they
[2:49:10] shall recover he knows that he what he
[2:49:12] was speaking of oh I want to see the
[2:49:14] church press into that place where it
[2:49:16] can come like God wants it to be
[2:49:21] you're still here
[2:49:23] then we're getting getting juicy now you
[2:49:25] see all them yellows yellow letters come
[2:49:28] up
[2:49:29] then when God was made flesh and became
[2:49:33] the Messiah
[2:49:34] then
[2:49:36] if we can yield ourselves to be anointed
[2:49:41] like he was
[2:49:45] if we let's read it together if we can
[2:49:48] yield ourselves to be the anointed like
[2:49:52] he was again if you don't mind I know
[2:49:54] I'm I'm getting on your nerves
[2:49:57] then if we can yield ourselves to be the
[2:50:01] anointed like he was
[2:50:03] have mercy don't that do anything to
[2:50:05] anybody
[2:50:07] am I the only one in here something I
[2:50:11] don't know where I I wouldn't even know
[2:50:13] how to define it but there is something
[2:50:15] maybe a seed or something I don't know
[2:50:18] what it but there is something on the
[2:50:20] inside of me that when I read that it
[2:50:22] just starts doing flips and flops
[2:50:25] there's something on the inside of me
[2:50:28] that says that is your destiny
[2:50:31] that wasn't just for brother Branham
[2:50:34] there's something on the inside of me
[2:50:35] that says that's for the little bride
[2:50:40] then if we can yield ourselves to be the
[2:50:42] anointed like he was
[2:50:44] we become
[2:50:49] now now before we go any further
[2:50:56] I want to help you
[2:50:59] I've had a talk with Webster
[2:51:02] when you add
[2:51:04] e-t-t-e it
[2:51:07] to a word
[2:51:08] it's a suffix
[2:51:10] you know not a prefix not on the front
[2:51:13] of the word but on the back of the word
[2:51:14] right
[2:51:16] when you add e-t-t-e a suffix used to
[2:51:21] form nouns
[2:51:23] meaning a similar form of something
[2:51:27] also used
[2:51:31] to form nouns meaning or implying the
[2:51:36] female
[2:51:37] equivalent of
[2:51:43] let me read it again
[2:51:47] a suffix used to form nouns meaning a
[2:51:51] smaller form
[2:51:53] of something
[2:51:55] also used to form nouns meaning or
[2:51:58] implying the female equivalent of
[2:52:05] now that that last part of that has been
[2:52:07] very offensive I didn't know it but it's
[2:52:10] been very offensive lately to the to the
[2:52:13] women's movement
[2:52:18] just just without a lot of sermon here
[2:52:22] if you are hauling your children down
[2:52:26] to see the Barbie movie
[2:52:28] there is something very seriously wrong
[2:52:33] in your head
[2:52:39] I wouldn't even let my daughters play
[2:52:42] when they were growing up with Barbie
[2:52:43] dolls
[2:52:45] because it was sexuality that was being
[2:52:48] presented to them as little children you
[2:52:50] never saw how many of you know that
[2:52:52] every woman's body is not built like
[2:52:54] Barbie
[2:52:58] every woman's chest is not built like
[2:53:01] Barbie
[2:53:02] and to put that on a little girl
[2:53:05] I couldn't do it
[2:53:07] I couldn't do it
[2:53:09] have you read the list of things they're
[2:53:10] saying about the Barbie movie
[2:53:13] Ken is an idiot
[2:53:18] says it
[2:53:19] Barbie is the queen she she is it
[2:53:23] there's two gay men
[2:53:26] Googling over Kian
[2:53:29] you won't take your little children down
[2:53:31] sit them down in front of that
[2:53:34] Barbie is the hero of the world
[2:53:37] sexist
[2:53:39] sexy and
[2:53:41] worldly
[2:53:46] Christians posting I'm giving my
[2:53:48] granddaughter a Barbie
[2:53:49] party
[2:53:52] something is seriously wrong
[2:53:55] with the Holy Ghost
[2:54:01] when you add e-t-t-e it's a suffix used
[2:54:04] to form nouns meaning a smaller form of
[2:54:08] something
[2:54:12] sometimes used to imply the female
[2:54:16] equivalent of so if we said the Messiah
[2:54:20] if I were to come along and use the word
[2:54:22] Messiah
[2:54:24] based on the definition
[2:54:27] the definition means a smaller form of
[2:54:29] something
[2:54:30] so if I were to call you a messiah I'm
[2:54:33] calling you a smaller form
[2:54:37] of him
[2:54:40] is that offensive
[2:54:42] and I might also be calling you the
[2:54:44] female version now that might get some
[2:54:46] men a little ticked
[2:54:50] but that's the bridal paradigm
[2:54:54] so if I were to say or you were to hear
[2:54:56] Brother random say we are Messiahs you
[2:54:59] you're not being told that you are the
[2:55:01] Messiah
[2:55:05] when Jesus referred to the writings of
[2:55:08] the prophets of gods with a little G he
[2:55:10] wasn't telling them that they were the
[2:55:12] god
[2:55:13] you see I I remember that when the
[2:55:16] sermons of brother Branham were first
[2:55:18] published
[2:55:20] they were published by an organization
[2:55:22] called the spoken word
[2:55:26] because that's what it was
[2:55:30] the confusion started when it made that
[2:55:33] transition
[2:55:35] from the spoken word to the voice of God
[2:55:39] because that is not a pie little geez
[2:55:44] I don't care what they say about me
[2:55:47] it's implying something more than should
[2:55:49] be applied implied
[2:55:51] absolutely so brother random is not
[2:55:54] telling us in this word Messiah that we
[2:55:57] become the Messiah big him
[2:55:59] or ask God's Big G
[2:56:03] he said little lies
[2:56:06] and here's three quick examples of the
[2:56:09] word with an e-t-t-e a statuette you
[2:56:12] ever heard the word statuette it means a
[2:56:14] small sculpture of a person or an animal
[2:56:17] which is often displayed on a shelf or a
[2:56:19] stand and not stand alone like a statue
[2:56:22] would a statuette a layette how many of
[2:56:25] your mothers know what Alaya is they
[2:56:27] don't even call it look look at the
[2:56:30] Stacy look around these young mothers
[2:56:33] that don't even know what a lay Ed is
[2:56:35] it's a word that's obsolete now it's not
[2:56:38] even used you used to go to a baby
[2:56:40] shower to receive your layout
[2:56:44] it means a small set or kit consisting
[2:56:47] of a complete outfit for a new baby
[2:56:51] how many of your mamas got layets and
[2:56:53] didn't even know what you got
[2:56:58] what a world we living in
[2:57:02] anybody know what a butt red is
[2:57:04] not a beret a barrette
[2:57:07] it is a small clip
[2:57:10] for holding hair in place
[2:57:13] any mother that brings me a little baby
[2:57:15] with a bow bigger than their head
[2:57:21] I look at them like what have you got
[2:57:23] here
[2:57:25] a baby not a poodle
[2:57:29] when Ashley come in I don't remember it
[2:57:30] was Tuesday night or Sunday but she
[2:57:32] brought in a beautiful little dress on
[2:57:34] on akiana and a little nice little bowl
[2:57:38] all in proportion
[2:57:42] little band a little boy I said Thank
[2:57:45] you thank you Ashley for not putting one
[2:57:47] of them big old bows
[2:57:49] the beauty is the baby
[2:57:52] not the size of the bow
[2:57:56] to each his own there's no Doctrine
[2:57:58] there do what you want to but when I
[2:58:00] look at it it just reminds me of
[2:58:02] something like Dolly overdone
[2:58:09] [Music]
[2:58:14] so if we say Messiah we mean a smaller
[2:58:18] version of Messiah
[2:58:21] with with the implication of a female
[2:58:24] form so a female form of a smaller
[2:58:27] version of Messiah if that disturbs you
[2:58:31] I don't even know what to say
[2:58:34] I went to all the trouble of talking to
[2:58:38] you all about layets and barrettes and
[2:58:40] just just to try to help you understand
[2:58:42] he's not trying to say you're Jesus
[2:58:46] but I miss this Jesus Christ
[2:58:49] [Applause]
[2:58:50] what the word teaches
[2:58:54] he said we become Messiahs little lights
[2:58:58] that's what the church is supposed to be
[2:59:01] lights
[2:59:02] little
[2:59:04] anointed ones that's God's church is
[2:59:08] there anybody that would be bold enough
[2:59:10] to say that doesn't seem to line up with
[2:59:12] the word
[2:59:14] come on
[2:59:16] I just hear that all through the word I
[2:59:18] don't hear the term Messiah
[2:59:21] but I hear the word the term
[2:59:24] manifested sons of God
[2:59:27] the spirit of adoption
[2:59:30] sons of God revealed to as many as as
[2:59:34] could could receive him to them to as
[2:59:37] many as are led by they are sons of God
[2:59:39] same thing
[2:59:41] you are not the big son of God
[2:59:44] your little sons of God
[2:59:48] you're not the big ill Messiah
[2:59:52] oh Hallelujah
[2:59:54] we're just smaller forms in the female
[2:59:58] Hallelujah
[3:00:00] of what he was
[3:00:02] and whether you can see it or not with
[3:00:04] unanointed eyes I pray you get some
[3:00:06] anointing on your eyes so that you can
[3:00:08] see it it's The Sweetest Love Story
[3:00:10] that's ever been told that God God
[3:00:12] almighty God holy Sovereign and supreme
[3:00:15] was not at peace to dwell alone
[3:00:20] he wanted to create me so that he might
[3:00:23] have fellow yeah relationship
[3:00:30] with me
[3:00:31] with you
[3:00:33] are you still here
[3:00:36] his standing light is the light of
[3:00:39] Messiah risen Christ in his people the
[3:00:42] anointed ones
[3:00:44] carrying forth his light into all the
[3:00:48] church ages
[3:00:49] sometimes it almost goes completely out
[3:00:51] are you with me
[3:00:53] I got four minutes here
[3:01:03] then it comes back again
[3:01:05] God's anointed one God's Messiah
[3:01:09] mess Messiah I guess he's saying Church
[3:01:14] if we use that word we would say
[3:01:16] Messianic
[3:01:17] simply meaning of the Messiah
[3:01:20] if Messiah means the anointed one and
[3:01:23] means king
[3:01:25] then if the church is Anointed by the
[3:01:27] Messiah Spirit it becomes a lesser
[3:01:31] is he making it clear
[3:01:35] would you dare call this false Doctrine
[3:01:38] nothing but the truth
[3:01:41] lesser but still a messiah a light
[3:01:46] an anointed one in the dark dark world
[3:01:52] if you can't be a light on the
[3:01:55] volleyball court
[3:01:57] you can never be a light in a dark dark
[3:02:00] world
[3:02:02] we must only every one of us all of us
[3:02:05] we must remember who we are
[3:02:09] if you can't be a driver a conscientious
[3:02:13] driver and be light
[3:02:18] if you can't show courtesy in the line
[3:02:24] if you can't grab somebody else's buggy
[3:02:27] while you're taking yours back
[3:02:29] [Music]
[3:02:31] you can't stop stop and pick up a piece
[3:02:34] of trash
[3:02:35] or pit because you think somebody else's
[3:02:38] job is to do it
[3:02:40] you can't be a light in the dark world
[3:02:44] come on you really believe I do I really
[3:02:47] do I really do I believe we have to
[3:02:49] shine wherever we are I believe we have
[3:02:51] to shine in all circumstances I believe
[3:02:54] we've got to shine in here and we gotta
[3:02:56] shine out there I believe it matters
[3:02:58] what we say I believe it all matters
[3:03:01] are you with me
[3:03:03] 10 minutes
[3:03:04] musicians you can just start to come
[3:03:07] walk very slow
[3:03:15] if Messiah means you're anointing one it
[3:03:17] means king then if the church is
[3:03:19] Anointed by the Messiah Spirit it
[3:03:21] becomes a lesser but still a messiah
[3:03:23] because it has his light reflecting his
[3:03:26] power reflecting his glory come on
[3:03:29] Church reflecting his Dominion
[3:03:32] so it is Messiah oh how it reflects him
[3:03:38] in his kingdom
[3:03:42] in his domain did you know you put him
[3:03:44] back on the throne by being a light to
[3:03:46] your generation
[3:03:48] did you know you give him back the
[3:03:50] Dominion that's due him when you are a
[3:03:52] light to your generation
[3:03:56] let's go on
[3:03:58] the trouble today guess what the trouble
[3:04:00] is
[3:04:01] we've organized the church to death
[3:04:04] hello hello hello hello hello hello
[3:04:10] we've got to have a board for everything
[3:04:14] got to have a board God to have a board
[3:04:16] Communications board got to have a board
[3:04:19] got to have a pastoral calling board
[3:04:21] we've got to have a come on we've got to
[3:04:24] have a financial board we've got to have
[3:04:27] a group of this uh gotta figure out how
[3:04:31] to organize that and
[3:04:36] for years we didn't even ask people
[3:04:39] what they were bringing to a dinner
[3:04:46] we do it now because we have a slightly
[3:04:48] different generation than the one we had
[3:04:50] then
[3:04:51] and we just want to make sure that we
[3:04:52] get enough of the different things
[3:04:54] because sometimes people think well if I
[3:04:57] don't like it nobody else does and
[3:04:59] that's not always the case maybe you
[3:05:01] don't like relish on your hot dog but
[3:05:03] maybe somebody else does so we got to
[3:05:05] have somebody to bring relish you
[3:05:07] understand what I'm saying but but
[3:05:08] before in the old day we never sent a
[3:05:11] list we never ask people to breathe we
[3:05:15] didn't we never had to
[3:05:18] I remember when it shifted it did shift
[3:05:21] and there were times that we didn't seem
[3:05:23] to have enough for everybody not enough
[3:05:25] for them to have everything they would
[3:05:26] want and it began so we so we had to
[3:05:29] pull a little bit and do a little bit
[3:05:30] more and now you people have risen to
[3:05:32] the cause and you are amazing and
[3:05:35] sometimes I wonder how in the world you
[3:05:37] do it and get it all done and bring it
[3:05:39] over here to feed one another and to
[3:05:41] feed visitors who come you're absolutely
[3:05:43] amazing my point is in the old days it
[3:05:46] was just kind of like the spirit of the
[3:05:49] Lord
[3:05:50] without any organization by man it was
[3:05:54] just like the spirit of the Lord would
[3:05:55] put it on people's hearts what to do
[3:06:01] I remember a time when the church never
[3:06:03] supplied a napkin never supplied a fork
[3:06:05] never Supply the plate
[3:06:09] now we don't mind because God helps us
[3:06:11] and blesses us and makes it possible and
[3:06:14] we did a Sam's run this week nearly a
[3:06:16] 200 Sam's run to get us ready to make
[3:06:18] sure we have everything we need
[3:06:20] including paper towels and that's why
[3:06:22] I'd be such a blessing if you would take
[3:06:24] your children into the washroom and show
[3:06:25] them how to use one paper towel two in
[3:06:28] the most
[3:06:30] I have people come and tell me sometime
[3:06:32] I was in there with the kids and they
[3:06:34] take eight or ten well I can't be in
[3:06:36] there to monitor that but it'd be just
[3:06:39] so great if one would do the job
[3:06:42] but in the so we have to keep all that
[3:06:45] in the paper and the tissues and
[3:06:47] whatever we we try the best we can but
[3:06:49] in the old days
[3:06:51] somebody would see a box of forks on
[3:06:54] sale and they would say I'm throwing
[3:06:56] them in the Boogie
[3:06:58] and we'd get up there and and Mike would
[3:07:01] nearly run out and somebody said oh no
[3:07:02] I've gotta I've got a box of Fortune in
[3:07:04] the truck
[3:07:06] what I am saying is sometimes we we over
[3:07:11] think and over organize and we don't
[3:07:15] give the spirit of God the opportunity
[3:07:18] and sometimes if we don't organize a
[3:07:20] little bit one or two people do it all
[3:07:22] and it should never be that way it
[3:07:24] should be a body function you understand
[3:07:25] what I'm saying I don't get hung up on
[3:07:27] plates and forks I'm not even preaching
[3:07:29] about that or or or too many people
[3:07:32] bring corn never it couldn't happen
[3:07:37] somebody said one time sister uh probes
[3:07:40] didn't bring deviled eggs because she
[3:07:42] thought there might be somebody else
[3:07:44] might be bringing them and they and
[3:07:45] they're wouldn't and she took some home
[3:07:48] I said nobody told me she took them home
[3:07:52] you can never have too many deviled eggs
[3:07:56] they're Angel eggs
[3:07:59] and you need them in a picnic
[3:08:03] isn't it amazing
[3:08:06] what the spirit of the Lord can do when
[3:08:08] we let him do
[3:08:10] I'm using something very silly but I've
[3:08:13] watched God orchestrate a service I've
[3:08:16] watched him put a camp meeting together
[3:08:18] Hallelujah
[3:08:21] let's not organize the church to death
[3:08:24] he said we've got organization instead
[3:08:27] of Messiah light we've got russellite
[3:08:30] prosely and may I humbly add branamite
[3:08:37] and all other kinds of light but we need
[3:08:41] Messiah light
[3:08:44] what the church needs today and should I
[3:08:47] have said shelly-eyed
[3:08:49] you don't need that either what we need
[3:08:52] today is the light of the Messiah
[3:08:56] oh I love him
[3:08:59] for his goodness
[3:09:01] anybody with me
[3:09:03] whoa
[3:09:05] now that's true God called Messiahs
[3:09:09] God called us and we become Kings and
[3:09:12] Priests unto God Like Jesus was God's
[3:09:15] high priest we become what
[3:09:20] a lesser priest
[3:09:23] Jesus was God in fullness dwelt in him
[3:09:25] to shine forth the expression of God to
[3:09:28] the world for God was in Christ
[3:09:30] reconciling the world to himself and his
[3:09:32] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[3:09:34] to himself God comes into his church and
[3:09:37] anoints him some Messiahs
[3:09:43] I can't show you the word Messiah but I
[3:09:47] don't have to take you to where it's
[3:09:49] implied
[3:09:50] I can take you to where he stated
[3:09:52] Greater Works
[3:09:56] Greater Works
[3:09:58] remember he said it's not greater
[3:10:00] quality
[3:10:02] it's greater quantity
[3:10:04] Greater Works than this shall you do
[3:10:08] Greater Works somebody say Greater Works
[3:10:12] you let some Messiahs get busy and
[3:10:15] greater work
[3:10:17] all right
[3:10:21] Greater Works will show up Among Us
[3:10:26] Hallelujah
[3:10:28] God comes into his church don't look at
[3:10:31] the church
[3:10:33] God comes in this church and anoints him
[3:10:37] some Messiah so my do you see it the
[3:10:39] same
[3:10:42] the search
[3:10:43] the same power he had is in his church
[3:10:47] and the CH and his church becomes his
[3:10:50] dominion and he's King over this
[3:10:52] dominion and we are Kings and Priests
[3:10:56] lesser Kings lesser priests but
[3:10:59] nonetheless
[3:11:01] Kings and Priests offering spiritual
[3:11:05] sacrifices to God that's what we were
[3:11:08] doing
[3:11:11] [Laughter]
[3:11:16] that's what we were doing in the morning
[3:11:21] spiritual sacrifices to God the fruit of
[3:11:24] our lips
[3:11:26] giving praise
[3:11:28] foreign
[3:11:32] to his name amen oh my there you are
[3:11:35] Messiahs Messiahs little Messiahs little
[3:11:38] anointing ones anointed of what
[3:11:40] anointed of what
[3:11:48] the main one
[3:11:50] anointed off of the
[3:11:57] he's not even trying to take something
[3:11:59] for himself
[3:12:01] he's not trying to put something on us
[3:12:02] that doesn't belong to us
[3:12:04] just write back to the word
[3:12:06] where are these sons of God where are
[3:12:08] these men and women doing Greater Works
[3:12:11] hmm
[3:12:17] paragraph 26 I'm not doing
[3:12:22] I might have to hold on to get through
[3:12:24] it
[3:12:25] now that was for messiah
[3:12:28] oh I just hear him I hear him I can hear
[3:12:31] it
[3:12:33] remember there are churches out there
[3:12:35] that don't even believe in miracles we
[3:12:37] some of the comments that were made
[3:12:39] these things ceased
[3:12:42] foreign
[3:12:44] someone spoke to one of the young
[3:12:46] Brothers in the church and said that the
[3:12:48] this that Holy Ghost baptism and all
[3:12:50] that that is
[3:12:51] you know of the devil
[3:12:54] that that ceased
[3:12:56] with the apostles
[3:13:00] listen you
[3:13:01] you don't have to go anywhere to church
[3:13:03] you don't want to go
[3:13:05] because you will find I could find you
[3:13:08] could find everybody can find a place
[3:13:10] somewhere that'll say it just like they
[3:13:12] want it to be said
[3:13:14] and if that's what folks are looking for
[3:13:15] they can find it
[3:13:19] we have folks who love us
[3:13:22] but can't come to church with us because
[3:13:25] they call our music Wild
[3:13:30] and some of them came from a church a
[3:13:33] church is where they didn't believe in
[3:13:34] playing musical instruments
[3:13:36] and so to come and sit in worship like
[3:13:39] this
[3:13:41] is more than they but they love us and
[3:13:44] they love a lot of what is preached here
[3:13:46] but they can't be apart because of the
[3:13:49] music
[3:13:50] and there are others who love the music
[3:13:52] and love the worship but can't swallow
[3:13:54] the truth
[3:13:55] the doctrine of Truth
[3:13:58] it but but you can't let that disturb
[3:14:01] your peace
[3:14:02] because there's something out there for
[3:14:04] everybody
[3:14:06] are you really preaching that with all
[3:14:08] my heart
[3:14:10] with all my heart I was told many years
[3:14:12] ago I wasn't called to lead everybody
[3:14:15] it's a hard hard lesson to learn because
[3:14:18] you want to when you like people when
[3:14:19] you love people
[3:14:21] but you can't always do it
[3:14:24] and there's always going to be so myself
[3:14:25] that was for the Messiah that was for
[3:14:28] the early church
[3:14:32] they say things like there are no
[3:14:34] musical instruments mentioned in the New
[3:14:36] Testament they didn't have to be
[3:14:38] because they were so well established in
[3:14:40] the Old Testament
[3:14:41] nobody had to come along and say well
[3:14:43] it's all right to still play the drum or
[3:14:45] the symbol or the guitar or whatever
[3:14:46] nobody had to say that
[3:14:48] because everybody knew that it was all
[3:14:50] right and it was a part of the way that
[3:14:51] people were called to worship God praise
[3:14:53] him on the loud standing symbols and
[3:14:55] praise him on the tavern praise him on
[3:14:56] the heart and praise
[3:14:58] it didn't change so there's no need to
[3:15:00] talk about it
[3:15:02] sometimes a good dose of Common Sense
[3:15:04] would help people interpret the
[3:15:05] scripture
[3:15:06] the Holy Ghost we need for sure but
[3:15:10] sometimes just a little common sense or
[3:15:11] studying just a little bit to know what
[3:15:13] hour it was spoken what was going on in
[3:15:15] that day
[3:15:16] Saint John 14 12 Jesus said he that
[3:15:20] believeth on me somebody say Saint John
[3:15:22] 14 12.
[3:15:24] 14 12 John 14 12 Jesus said he that
[3:15:28] believeth on me the works that I do
[3:15:30] shall he do also
[3:15:34] brother for him said Messiahs that's
[3:15:36] right Messiahs the representation of
[3:15:38] Messiah on Earth yet
[3:15:41] let's go on
[3:15:44] Mark 16 he said go ye into all the word
[3:15:47] and preach the gospel these signs shall
[3:15:49] follow
[3:15:50] the Messiahs
[3:15:53] he that believeth that is baptized shall
[3:15:55] be saved he that believeth not shall be
[3:15:56] down and these signs shall follow them
[3:16:00] that believe are there any believers
[3:16:02] here
[3:16:03] how far to all the world
[3:16:06] who too every creature oh I'm so glad
[3:16:09] how are you going to rub that out said
[3:16:11] it's just only to the disciples to the
[3:16:13] disciples he said to all the world and
[3:16:15] every creature these signs shall follow
[3:16:18] them that believe
[3:16:21] I wonder where people that don't believe
[3:16:22] in signs and wonders following the
[3:16:24] Believers how would you ever read the
[3:16:25] history of the church and think it
[3:16:27] ceased with the apostles in the church
[3:16:29] ages it just continued down through he
[3:16:31] said I read the nice I feel sorry for
[3:16:33] your brother bam that's hard reading
