Description:
The courts of Heaven operate according to God’s divine order. No matter what the accuser says, he has no case when the blood has been legally appropriated to our lives. This is our day to be Kingdom minded, to keep ourselves in right standing with the Highest Judicial System and to be about the Father’s business.
