TRANSCRIPT
========================================
real Ministry comes out of the inside of the inside that's Spirit it cannot be demonstrated from Spirit to flesh it must pass through the inner dimension of man so it may originate in the spirit that's the only kind of praise and worship that God will honor is that that originates in spirit and in order for it to transfer itself to the demonstration of the body you know some people say well I have a feeling that he was in the flesh well I hope he was because if he wasn't in the flesh he was a disembodied spirit and I'm not interested in anything he does somebody said I saw him and he was just waving his arms and carrying on he must have been in the flesh sure he was sure one his flesh is the only thing that God has given him to demonstrate what's happening in the inner man are you in the flesh when you raise up your hands and praise the Lord sure you are but your praise doesn't originate in your flesh it doesn't originate in your body it's origin Hallelujah is the inside of the inside that which originates that which is birthed in the spirit passes through the realm of mind you've got to make a choice will and then what else emotions so yes praise and worship is going to be emotional we respond emotionally sometime without faith and we respond negatively and and in an ill way and it accomplishes nothing but your emotions are not your enemy right your soul is not your enemy it's a gift of God to filter life it helps your spirit to be in touch with your flesh it's the middleman the breath of God's spirit ruach hakodesh the breath of the Holy Spirit went into a flesh body one made of the earth Adam from the earth from the red clay he breathed breath into the nostrils of Adam the dirt and Adam became a living Soul he was breath and body before he became a living Soul breath entered into a body before he became a living Soul his soul was given to him that he might remain in contact with his environment there is a a sense in our life that we have to be connected to the environment around us and the atmosphere around us while maintaining our connection to God and without our mind without our will and without our emotions we would not be able to stay connected to Earth to reality to life to family to to obligations to jobs to the Natural Life that we must live if it were not for the mind and the will and the emotions the soul of man we would not be able to remain connected to the life around us to the Earth around us to the environment around us to the atmosphere around us and had it not been for mine will and emotion our spirit would not be able to always remain connected to God our creator and the inspiration of our life because there needed to be a way of expressing our gratitude our Thanksgiving so yes let me just boil that down for you there's going to be emotion in your praise
