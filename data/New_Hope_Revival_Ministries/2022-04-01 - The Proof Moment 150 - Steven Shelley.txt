Description:
There is a place of true intimacy and relationship with the Lord that only happens beyond the veil in our private life.  In that place of change from Bride to Wife, we get to know the Lord in a way we’ve never known Him.  We will soon come to the place in which we must present the proof and evidence that we’ve been with the Lord.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we will have to come out of that secret place with proof with evidence that we have been with the lord [Music] i don't believe that most intimacy with christ takes place in the church house i believe that most real relationship with him that that happens on the other side of the veil is in your private life and i encourage every one of you to get rid of things that you need to get rid of to make more time or discipline yourself if that's how you need to do it so that you can make more time i'm telling you it'll make all the difference in the world it's in that realm of intimacy that revelation begins to flow your identity begins to change and you begin to realize you're not just engaged to the bridegroom but he has claimed you as his own and he desires to know you as no one has ever known you because your heart responds by desiring to know him in a way that you've never known him you see there's coming an hour that we're not going to be able to fake it till we make it there's going to be an hour that we have to go all the way in we will have to come out of that secret place with proof with evidence that we have been with the lord you can't lie there with him and come out the same old same old same old same old you can't lay there with him and come out holding on to the things that weary you and worry you outside that bridal chamber you've got to be willing to lay all of that aside and sometimes we can't do it by ourself [Music] there's nothing like the ecstasy of knowing that you belong fully [Music] to him
