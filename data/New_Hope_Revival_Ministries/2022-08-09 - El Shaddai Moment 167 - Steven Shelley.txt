Description:
Our salvation is not based on a feeling, a vision, a dream or prophecy.  Our salvation must be based on the Word.  However, without a personal experience we have not encountered the Living God.  God appeared to Abram as El Shaddai, He breathed His Life into him, changed his name to Abraham, so his name would forever bear the Breath of the Name of God.  Likewise we must be born from above. When we feed on His bosom, we nurse from His very Life.  I AM El Shaddai will provide for us what we cannot do for ourselves.
