Description:
We are eagles, and we are believing God for great promises in our lives.  But we have only begun to scratch the surface and only begun to believe Him for the fulness of the things He has in store for us.  We’ve only caught a glimpse here and there, and a harvest will follow, then a short quick work will take us to the rapture.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i want to tell you this morning under the inspiration of the holy spirit that you're not even really believing for the fullness of what he has because he hasn't even let you know the whole [Music] we're eagles let's soar out of [Music] you're you're talking like i can just do it at will i can just get above it you're understanding me you're not misunderstanding me you are understanding me because we know that our atmosphere is controlled by our mindset if you've got a mindset for the valley the valley is where you're going to peck around if you've got a mindset just to get above the heads of somebody else that's about how high you'll fly you'll look around and say well at least i'm better off than he is you know that's not your goal just to get up a little above somebody in your family or somebody in your church you've got something more of pulling on you than to just get up above a little circumstance you've got a whole heaven out there that's calling you to higher heights to new dimensions to new realms of the spirit that you and i have only pecked into tapped into we're called to be immersed in those things not just taste them like appetizers in a meal but we are to feast on the hope and the promise that god has given us i've got some things for you that you've never walked in and you've never known and you've never understood so many around this message put everything in the past but i noticed the prophet never put anything in the past he had a tendency to call even the future into the present he'd look out there and see what god was going to do and then he'd say he's doing it where is somebody going to take that kind of an example today and look out there at what god is going to do and what he's promised to do and raise up and say he's doing it somebody said well i'm not experiencing that just because you and i are not experiencing that doesn't mean that it's not true doesn't mean that god's not doing it somewhere for those who believe so i encourage you dare to believe to take god at his word i want you to know hope's a powerful force it takes more than hope to get the job done but hope will keep you pointed in the right direction until your faith can be anointed the enemy wants you hopeless the enemy wants you to feel bankrupt and helpless and that there's no way out of the situation that you're in right now but i want you to know there is and even greater some of you that are believing god for great promises in your life i want to tell you this morning under the inspiration of the holy spirit that you're not even really believing for the fullness of what he has because he hasn't even let you know the whole what we're operating on now is just what he lets us get a hold of a glimpse here and there but the half has never yet been told of what god desires to do in you through you a harvest will follow a quick short work and then a rapture hallelujah then you can ask one another how do i look leave in this world [Music]
