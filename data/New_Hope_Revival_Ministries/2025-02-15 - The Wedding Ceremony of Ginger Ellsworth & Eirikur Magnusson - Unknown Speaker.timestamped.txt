[18:53] lives together we Rejoice with them and
[18:56] we are thankful to the Lord for creating
[18:59] this Union of hearts that was built
[19:01] first on friendship respect and then
[19:05] love it's been a personal joy for me to
[19:08] know ginger for a very long time she has
[19:12] persevered through many difficult
[19:14] circumstances and endured numerous
[19:17] disappointments to stand before us today
[19:20] ready to embrace yet another exciting
[19:24] challenge one that her heart has longed
[19:27] for many years
[19:29] Ginger you pushed and pulled and fought
[19:31] your way to go back to school and earn a
[19:34] degree perhaps so that you could always
[19:37] provide for yourself and then an
[19:40] incredibly amazing thing happened that
[19:43] was far more important than a career
[19:45] Ginger you bravely stepped up quite a
[19:48] few years ago to willingly change the
[19:51] trajectory of a beautiful little girl's
[19:53] life that little girl Olivia is now a
[19:56] treasure to all of us
[19:59] and in fact she's no longer a little
[20:01] girl but is growing into a dear young
[20:05] lady right in front of our eyes Ginger
[20:08] I'm so thankful to know that she will
[20:10] always be a priority in your life and
[20:12] I'm thankful that a consistent and godly
[20:15] male influence will now be an added
[20:17] benefit in her life Ginger I'm so happy
[20:21] for you
[20:23] today you deserve love and happiness
[20:28] brother Eric it's hard to believe that
[20:31] we have known each other for nearly 20
[20:33] years in those 20 years I've never heard
[20:36] you complain about anything or criticize
[20:39] anyone and despite what some people
[20:41] think you are more than capable of a
[20:44] long and engaging
[20:46] conversation I've spent time with you in
[20:49] Iceland at the fs and the waterfalls and
[20:53] up and down the hills of Jerusalem and
[20:56] all that I've ever known about you is
[20:59] utmost integrity and godly character
[21:03] when the Lord reached out for you he
[21:05] made the incredible difference in your
[21:07] life and you have sacrificially given
[21:09] him your all and you served God the
[21:12] ministry Christian television and others
[21:16] you mentioned to me one time years ago
[21:19] that you would still love to have a wife
[21:21] and family my dear friend and brother
[21:24] today is that
[21:25] day Ginger and Eric before the found
[21:28] foundation of the world our loving
[21:31] father had both of you on his mind he
[21:34] knew even before you were born that you
[21:36] would at different times choose to make
[21:38] Jesus the Lord of your life and by his
[21:42] forn knowledge of you he predestinated
[21:44] you both to be conformed to the image of
[21:46] his son he then allowed you to hear his
[21:49] salvation call individually and
[21:51] independently of each other and with a
[21:53] heartfelt yes you responded to his
[21:56] wooing the word predestin destination
[21:59] speaks of having a predetermined Destiny
[22:02] one that was chosen for us a plan that
[22:04] we may sometimes stray from however the
[22:07] destiny is so predetermined by God that
[22:10] he consistently reaches out to us
[22:13] through his Spirit urging us to correct
[22:16] our paths and realign our lives with his
[22:19] perfect plan with his perfect will I
[22:22] believe that the two of you have walked
[22:25] your destiny out as individuals to this
[22:27] point in your life life I also believe
[22:30] that the two of you realizing that you
[22:31] cared for one another and then falling
[22:33] in love with each other and eventually
[22:36] feeling that you wanted to spend the
[22:37] rest of your lives together it might
[22:40] have caught some of us by surprise but
[22:43] it did not catch God by
[22:49] surprise in fact it appears that he had
[22:53] this in his mind all along that this day
[22:57] is a part of God's great big plan the
[23:00] vows that you will soon make before our
[23:02] creator and in the company of those who
[23:04] love you so much will serve as a ceiling
[23:07] to what God is destined for our for your
[23:10] lives on this day February the 15th
[23:14] 20125 not just two people but two
[23:18] Destinies come together no longer
[23:20] separated and with nothing or no one to
[23:22] divide them or to stand in their
[23:25] way God's predetermined will and plan
[23:28] hands now intersect
[23:32] intertwine this marks the spot where two
[23:34] Destinies become one and God is pleased
[23:37] that you have chosen to walk out his
[23:39] plan for your lives together as your
[23:42] Stateside Pastor who loves you both
[23:45] dearly I bless this day and your future
[23:49] together in the name of the Lord Jesus
[23:51] Christ the Apostle Paul gave us all the
[23:55] best advice in a letter that he wrote to
[23:57] the Ephesians Church concerning the
[24:02] marriage in chapter 5: 21 submitting
[24:05] yourselves to one another in the fear of
[24:07] God wives submit yourselves unto your
[24:10] own husbands as unto the Lord for the
[24:13] husband is the head of the wife even as
[24:15] Christ is the head of the church and he
[24:17] is the savior of the body therefore as
[24:20] the church is subject to Christ so let
[24:22] the wives be subject to their own
[24:24] husbands in everything husbands love
[24:27] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[24:30] church and gave himself for it that he
[24:34] might sanctify it and cleans it by the
[24:37] washing of Water by the word that he
[24:40] might present it to himself a glorious
[24:44] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[24:47] such thing but that it would be holy and
[24:49] without blemish so ought men to love
[24:51] their wives as our own bodies he that
[24:53] loveth his wife loveth himself for no
[24:57] man ever yet hat hated his own flesh but
[24:59] nourish nourisheth it and cherisheth it
[25:03] even as the Lord the church for we are
[25:05] members of his body of his flesh and of
[25:08] his
[25:09] bones for this cause shall a man leave
[25:12] his father and mother and shall be
[25:14] joined unto his wife and these two shall
[25:16] be one flesh this is a great mystery
[25:19] Paul said but I speak concerning Christ
[25:22] and his church nevertheless let every
[25:24] one of you in particular so love his
[25:26] wife even as himself self and the wife
[25:29] see that she reverence her husband
[25:32] Ginger and Eric as you now prepare to
[25:34] take your vows give careful thought and
[25:37] prayer for as you make them you are
[25:41] making an exclusive commitment one to
[25:43] the other for as long as you both shall
[25:46] live your love for each other should
[25:48] never be diminished by difficult
[25:51] circumstances and it is to endure until
[25:54] death Parts you as God's children your
[25:56] marriage is strengthened by your OB
[25:58] obedience to your heavenly father and
[26:00] his word as you give God complete
[26:03] control of your marriage he will make
[26:05] your home a place of joy and a testimony
[26:07] to the world around you Ginger and Eric
[26:10] you are giving yourselves to each other
[26:13] in unselfish love you will make a solemn
[26:16] vow to each other a deliberate promise
[26:18] that come what may for better for worse
[26:21] in sickness and in health you will be
[26:23] true and faithful to each other this
[26:26] service is far more than the exchange of
[26:28] a solemn vow it is one of blessing it is
[26:31] the it is only with God's help that you
[26:34] can steadfastly keep the promises that
[26:36] you will make to each other today our
[26:38] savior is here to bless and to guide you
[26:41] he will always be by your side I charge
[26:43] you both as you stand in the presence of
[26:45] God to remember that if steadfastly you
[26:48] seek to do the will of your heavenly
[26:51] father your life will be full of peace
[26:53] and joy and the home which you are
[26:55] establishing will abide through every ch
[26:58] challenge give of yourselves to each
[27:00] other deeply freely and generously ever
[27:04] recalling the words of the poet who said
[27:06] love ever gives forgives outlives and
[27:11] ever stands with open hands and while it
[27:14] lives it gives for this is Love's
[27:16] prerogative to give and give and give a
[27:21] marriage is not 5050 it's giving 100% of
[27:26] who you are to each other and asking God
[27:29] to come and
[27:30] help marriage is a relationship of two
[27:33] persons that are not always at their
[27:34] best even in moments of human failing I
[27:37] counsel you always to do your best to
[27:39] act in love and compassion to one
[27:41] another sharing the spirit expressed in
[27:43] the scripture we read be kind to one
[27:46] another tenderhearted forgiving one
[27:49] another your love for each other must be
[27:51] nurtured until it attains to the state
[27:53] of perfect love which is intended by God
[27:56] for his chosen bride we're going to now

[28:02] has been so good to all of us feel free

[38:39] why and I've never been so sure of
[38:44] anything in my

[38:50] God was
[38:54] thinking when he cre
[39:00] [Music]
[39:02] you I wonder if he I knew everything I
[39:07] would
[39:08] need because he made all my dreams come
[39:13] [Applause]
[39:16] true When God Made You he must have been
[39:22] thinking about me
[39:27] I promise that wherever you may
[39:34] go whereever life may lead you with all
[39:38] my heart I'll be there
[39:41] too and from this moment on I want you
[39:45] to
[39:48] know how let nothing come between us and
[39:53] I will love the ones you
[39:55] love so go H all my questions about
[40:02] why and I've never been so sure of
[40:07] anything in my
[40:10] life oh I wonder what
[40:14] God was
[40:18] thinking when he
[40:21] created
[40:23] [Music]
[40:24] you I wonder if he knew everything I
[40:30] would
[40:31] need because he made all my dreams come
[40:38] true When God Made You it must have been
[40:44] thinking about
[40:49] me he made the sun he made the moon to
[40:54] harmonize the perfect tune can do
[40:58] without the other they just have to be
[41:03] together and that is how I know it's
