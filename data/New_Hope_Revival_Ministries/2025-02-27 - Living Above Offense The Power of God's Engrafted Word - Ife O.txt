Description:
Like an eagle soaring above life's storms, you too can rise above past hurts and offenses through the transformative power of God's Word. When you allow this living Word to be engrafted into your heart daily—not just through occasional services but through consistent praise, worship, and meditation—it produces wholeness and spiritual strength. The choice is yours: yield to the Word instead of emotions, past experiences, or excuses, and watch as grace empowers you to live an unoffendable, spiritually ascended life.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is it really possible to live an unoffendable life it is but it's an ascended life and that doesn't mean some Eastern mysticism it means getting up above your stuff it means being who God called you to be and anointed you with a flying eagle anointing and that flying eagle anointing wants to lift you up above your hurt your father issues your mama issues your come on your past yes we got to get past our past we've got to deal with stinking thinking we've got to realize the way to win this mind battle is to meditate on the word of the Lord I'll take your Stony heart Hallelujah and I will engraft in you my Living Word and my Living Word transplanted into your life will bring renewal and generation to your Fallen human spirit and I will not just pass my word over you but I will make it a part of who you are it's an engrafted word that we have received so brother sister amen we can overcome offense and anger and bitterness and jealousy not because we're superheroes but because we have a word that has been engrafted it has stimulated in us a new kind of cell it has transformed us from needy to sufficient this word has what has this word has Praise His Name the longterm solution is to step back and let that engrafted word begin to produce healthiness and wholeness in your body and it can do that as you water the word and how do we water the word by coming into his presence it's not just hearing the preaching we have to do it's daily entering into the presence of the Lord by engaging the word by engaging him in praise and worship by visiting what we believe two times a week is not enough to remain spiritually strong and emotionally and mentally healthy did you know that the word of God that has been engrafted into your life is there to save you in the area of your mind your will and your emotions the engrafted word is working on you your body is preparing itself to receive that word that God has attached to you and if we yield to the word instead of our emotion if we yield to the word instead of our past if we yield to the word instead of our excuses well I've always handled it like that before that was then have you been intimate with the word have you opened up your life good question and allowed the word of God to overshadow your life are you willing to change your opinions your decisions because the word says something different you believe what you believe today because you came here wired to receive it because there was something in you there was a representation in you that right there just that ought to be enough to make you shout your shoes right off your feet the very grace of God the very mercy of God with tens of thousands of people spurning and rejecting truth around us God let little owe you hear that truth and not just say Amen with your tongue but say Amen with your life
