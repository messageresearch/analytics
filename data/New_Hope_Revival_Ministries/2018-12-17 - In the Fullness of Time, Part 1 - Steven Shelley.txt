TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right I Christ in you the hope award [Music] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley from New Hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama and I'm coming to you again today in partnership with our wonderful friends at the gospel channel and we appreciate the privilege that the Lord has given us to come to you week after week telling the best news there is no better news than the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ it's the good news but it's the great news we're just so very thankful that we have the light the light of the world Jesus Yeshua our Messiah has come I know a lot of people around this time of year they like to celebrate Christmas and they like to spend a lot of money and they like to run two parties here and there and for many people it's a very enjoyable time of the year but I wonder sometimes when God looks at it I wonder how he feels I wonder what he thinks about how people have so commercialized this time of year while often trying to make it about his coming I want you to know more importantly than you celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ in fact the scripture actually gives us no indication that that's something that we should remember although we are so very thankful for his coming for his precious birth every day the Bible actually tells us that we should celebrate his death and his resurrection and we do that we celebrate his birth we celebrate his death and his resurrection not with our parties not with our exchanging gifts not by borrowing customs and traditions from pagans of long ago but we do that by living a life of sacrifice of consecration and Thanksgiving we have so much to be thankful for not just around this time of year but every day of our lives I think there's great eight victory and great success in living a life with an attitude of gratitude I know for myself I'm human just like all of you who are watching this program and I have those emotional roller coasters that some of you are so familiar with and when I get to that place where I just feel blue or heavy or down maybe slightly depressed if I can take a few moments to begin to look at my life and what God has given me I have a beautiful wife who I love very much and who has loved me in a way that I didn't think possible and I have four wonderful children I'm blessed with amazing friends I have a wonderful church family I have a very dedicated staff who love the Lord with all of their hearts and who labor for the kingdom of God in such a sacrificial way who stand with me in the victories and in the defeats and I'm blessed I just start going down you know maybe if I have some sickness or a little bit of maybe a new ache or pain you know and you start feeling sorry for yourself you look around and you see people who are suffering and you pray for them and yet there's something in your heart that says Lord I may not feel the best today but I am so grateful and I'm so thankful for how you have touched me and strengthened me and helped me and my life looks a whole lot easier than many of the lives of the people that I I see around me you just start reflecting on how good god has been I don't have a big fancy home to live in we live in a small three-bedroom home our boys share a bedroom our girls share a bedroom but it's warm in the winter and and cool in the summer it's everything we need that's the goodness of God I have a fairly comfortable bed I have plenty of clothes to wear you can tell that I have plenty to eat much more than I need God has been good to me you see you just start looking over your life that way and you feel yourself being lifted its his grace it's his mercy it's his love so no matter how you choose to celebrate during this time of year I implore you in fact I beg you in the name of the Lord don't leave Jesus out of your lives don't leave him out of your celebration and your Thanksgiving when you sit down to a meal and you enjoy the good food and the fellowship of your friends and your loved ones remember that it is all by the grace of God it is by the grace of God that we have what we have and he deserves the highest praise and I think we ought to give that to him not just in one particular season or a couple of seasons of the year but but every day this is the day that the Lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in it just a few days ago we had a stretch of gloomy weather here at home this is the month of December and it can be very warm in the day yet and very cool at night sometimes we have rainy spells and we were going through quite a rainy spell and it was quite cold and my children were complaining a little bit oh I would just surely love to see the sunshine well I agree I like the sunshine myself but I just said to the children but remember this this is the day that the Lord has made sunny rainy gloomy cold too hot whatever it is it's the day that the Lord has made and that gives us a reason to rejoice and a reason to celebrate I want you to know the world was in a terrible condition once upon a time with no hope today the world is in a terrible condition but I want you to know we have all the hope we have the hope above all hopes because we have the assurance and the confidence in knowing that Jesus has loved us Yeshua our Messiah has paid the ultimate price on our behalf and by His grace we are saved he has shed his blood he has healed our bodies he has lifted up our heads when we couldn't lift him up hold him up ourselves he's a very very good God he is an ever-present help in the time of need so I I wish you a wonderful season of love and fellowship with those you love however you choose to celebrate it at my house my family my great-grandparents were Lithuanian Jews we feel compelled to light the menorah at this time of the year to remember the the miracle to remember that God is a miracle working God we celebrate the fact that during this season the altar of the Holy Temple was rededicated after it had been so desecrated by the enemies of Israel and how God provides and we use this as an opportunity to rededicate our hearts to him to remember that he is the light every time we light the candle we remember it's because of you Yeshua Lord Jesus Christ you are the light whatever your holiday tradition looks like again I pray that you can enjoy your family you can enjoy the food and the festivity that goes with it but I pray that you will use this season as an opportunity to recon secrete and rededicate your life to Him he has been so good and he is so good to us thank you for your prayer requests for your phone calls of encouragement I get really blessed we've even had people call and say I need DVDs and I need to have some audio recordings because I am so blessed that to be able to listen to it whenever I want to whenever I need to and that's encouraging to us and let me remind you you can do that without a DVD without a CD you can visit our YouTube page and on that page you can subscribe and you will be notified of any additional material in fact all of the programs that we do for the gospel channel are available 24 hours a day seven days a week at your at your convenience you can go and watch them or listen to them and there are some songs and some other programs that I believe would inspire you and bless you and it gives us another way to be connected I want to say as always it's a joy to pray with you about your needs to believe God and we don't mind doing it we feel like it's a pleasure and it's an honor to put our faith together with yours but I'll tell you what I really like I really like when that phone call comes back or an email comes back and says the Lord has heard and answered prayer I'm feeling better or I got a good report at the doctor thank you for praying or I see some changes in my loved ones that I've asked you all to pray with me about that is super encouraging and I want to thank you for taking the time to reach out again and let us know that God is answering prayer once again he is a prayer answering God to sort of commemorate or to remember this time of year that is so vitally important to so many people around the world and I think many people celebrate the Christmas season just it's just become a wonderful secular tradition and many people have no idea why they do it they've just been doing it for so long and and then there are others who sincerely use this time of year as an opportunity to say an extra thank you to God for sending his only bee gotten Sun and so to sort of look at this season with you I want to go to the scriptures and I want to share with you some thoughts that the Lord has given me concerning the hour that we're living in and how that every bit of this was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world he knew about it all and he planned a way of escape remember I told you that 2,000 years ago the world was in terrible shape without any hope and then Hope showed up hope was born in a little manger there's no doubt in my mind that that was the gift of God to the earth and so we can say today the world is again in great turmoil around us but thanks be to God we still have the hope the hope that was brought to us when God Himself the Living Word of God became flesh and dwelt among us this is the good news and I want to share a little of it with you today and I want to start in the newer Testament in the New Testament in the book of Galatians chapter 4 maybe if you're in your living room there you you have your Bible sitting beside you maybe you'll just pick it up and and read along with me and if not you'll see some of it on the screen I want to read beginning in verse 1 Galatians 4 now I say that the air as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come what a phrase when the fullness of the time was come listen at what happened God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father it's like saying papa wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ I want you to know the news just doesn't get any better than Galatians 4 verses 1 through 7 I'm so grateful to understand that God had a plan approximately 4,000 years of history was on the other side of the fullness of the time God had a plan from the beginning it wasn't four thousand years of nothingness it wasn't four thousand years of aimless wandering around on planet Earth in fact God was very very connected with his children from the beginning from the Garden of Eden and we see that as the first five books of the Bible referred to as the Torah when we see in that history of the creation and in the origin the the the beginnings of God's dealings with man on the earth and we follow that through the kings and the Chronicles and we hear of the victories and the exploits of those who trusted in God it seems like from the very beginning the enemy had raised up and would continue to do so throughout history to try and come against the promises of God the purposes of God in the lives of his children but in every one of those situations in every one of those conflicts God has a victory he has a champion he has someone who will be steadfast and faithful sometimes it's men of great intelligence but not always sometimes it's men of great physical strength and stamina but not always you see God can use anyone and everyone who is willing to surrender and to yield of themselves what they have to give you see God doesn't have to have any particular man with a particular core strength or talent he knows how when he was creating us you see I believe and will share with you in the scripture that he knew about us way before we were ever born on planet Earth and I believe in giving us a prefix destiny he provided everything we need it may not look like someone else's provision but I believe that he provided for us everything we need to do His perfect will while we sojourn here on planet Earth remember friend this is not the end everything that goes on in our lives today everything that swirls around you today is temporal but there is an eternity with God and if we finish this race holding on to Jesus Christ being washed in his blood baptized in his name filled with his Holy Spirit then life is just beginning for us when they perhaps place us in that box and lay this body in the ground that's the end of our sojourn in time but that is not the end of who we are because there's something on the inside of us that is eternal that will never pass away I think we read in scripture where the riders have said you know this body returns back to the dust back to the skin worms and that's where they find their nourishment but that's not who you are this is just the temporary house that we're living in until that hour that we step out of time and into eternity into the very presence of God so cheer on brother sister be encouraged and know that what we experience here on earth is just for a season for a moment life is like the vapor that appears on the glass maybe you wake up on a frosty morning and you see that moisture running down the outside of the window but you let the Sun come up and it dries up the vapor off of the glass life is just as temporal it's that moisture that runs down the window pane but thanks be to God that's the life here on earth that's the earthly life the temporal life but there is an eternity the only way to have eternal life is to have a relationship with Jesus Christ that's what these scriptures tell us the world was moving forward and life was going forward started in the garden but then there was great progression we read of great advancements we read of God's goodness to the people we read of how they forgot God we read about the flood there there's so many things that we read about God always pursuing man always reaching out to save to rescue to help and what did hard-headed men do what do we do what do we hard-headed men do we try to figure it out on our own even as they did in the Old Testament and we see they paid a great price oftentimes for their rebellion and for their wickedness but we can follow that scarlet thread of redemption we can start in the Garden of Eden and we see that God had a plan I want you to know today God has a plan he's not standing in heaven watching over the earth to see what's about to happen so he can figure out what to do next no sir that's you and I we're kind of waiting to see what's gonna happen and trying to formulate a plan for what we're gonna do next in life but all we have a father we have a Heavenly Father and he's not trying to figure it all out he already has he already has it figured out he knows the end from the beginning he knows the beginning from tomorrow he knows all the way through eternity there's no limit to what he knows because there's no limit to eternity sometimes when I think about that it's too big for me to get my mind around I can hardly comprehend the the hugeness the bigness of God in fact sometimes he looks so big I wonder why he's even mindful of me but when I began to look at his interaction and his care his concern his provision in my life I am fully convinced that is big and vast as he is as powerful and all-knowing and all-loving and all-powerful omniscient I am convinced that he does see me he sees my life he sees my future he knows my tomorrows but he also he knows everything my yesterdays that's what I was looking for he knows by yesterday's he certainly knows my today and he knows by tomorrow when I can really get a hold of that it gives me a peace it gives me a place of rest we used to sing a song many years ago when I was a boy I don't know about tomorrow I just live for today there are so many things that I can figure out about tomorrow but I know may I may not know about tomorrow but I know who holds tomorrow you need to remember that when life gets tough when circumstances get ugly you need to come back and remember no it's true we as children of God on this earth we don't always know what tomorrow holds but we can rest assured in knowing who holds tomorrow and he's going to be with us tomorrow as he is with us today holding our hand if we need it swatting us on the on the backside if we need it lifting us up when we need it that's the God we serve I'm not going to tell you that there are not times that he has to get our attention because there there are times there are times that he has to bring a little discipline in our life and you know why because we're learning to be sons that's what Galatians is talking about in fact in verse 1 it says as long as he is a child he eats not differing much from a servant in the father's house though he's really Lord of all but he sits under tutors and governors and teachers he learns what it means to be a real son of the Father and that's what you and I are doing we are learning to be real sons of our Heavenly Father and we must understand that as real sons of our Heavenly Father we have both benefits blessings and we have responsibilities I'm just thankful I'm just so very thankful that everything he asked of us he so graciously provides the gray that we need to be obedient so I want you to know today that before the heavens were ever created before there was ever an earth before there were oceans and seas in the earth God had in his great big mind a blueprint not only for planet Earth but he had a blueprint full of his plans and his purposes for the earth and for every person that would ever be born on that planet as long as time would exist it's like an architect I don't know if you have ever seen an architect's drawings or not but it gets more detailed as you flip the pages oftentimes you get a set of blueprints and and on the first page at least the ones I've seen you have sort of the outside structure the overall view we could say the overview of the home or the church building or the office building whatever it is but as you flip the big pages and you begin to look it begins to break it down the electrical system the plumbing system why if you look carefully you can almost always see every place an electrical outlet it's going to go to plug in your appliances you can see where a closet is going to be where a bathroom is going to be where a stove or a washer and dryer is going to be placed because the connections have to be there and so things have to be prepared ahead of time so it seems that in a blueprint of an architect the more you keep turning pages the closer and the detail gets greater and you begin to learn the the little intricate ins and outs of this beautiful design well I want you to know that God knows all of that it's you and I that are turning pages it's you and I that are studying the blue which I would call it this this Bible is a blueprint this Bible is a written record of the word of God the Living Word of God has been captured for us in words on a page and I am so grateful for it because indeed it is a blueprint we can read it through at certain points in our life and we're getting an overview but when we begin to hunger when we begin to thirst when we begin to desire to know God not just to know about him but to know him in a place of relationship in a place of intimacy that's when we start flipping pages turning pages and that's when we can start examining those little verses of Scripture that we have read before but now the Holy Spirit of God wants to show you where the plug is going to go in the wall the Holy Spirit wants to show you where the closet is going to be where the outlets of the different connectors and all those little pieces of the puzzle all those details that's what happens in the Christian life the more we turn the pages the more we present ourselves to God in prayer the more we ask him for revelation I don't believe that revelation is automatic because you have invited Jesus into your life to forgive you of your sins I believe that revelation is something we ask for I believe it's something that we keep coming back to God and saying open my eyes Lord I want to see you I want to see you in every page of the blueprint I want to recognize you every time I turn a page I want to be able to identify it's really you in my life working for my good so God is the architect he's the master designer and he draws out the plans with specific details and functions all of these things begin to develop in the mind of God from the very beginning based on his design and plans thoughts that he has about planet Earth and about time and how it would progress he can draw out a picture of exactly what the finished product will look like and then someone is chosen who can make those drawings that represent ideas become a physical reality so sometimes it's I have a desire to have a home and so I hire an architect someone who can draw out the plans and make all the details then someone else comes along to do the building and to do the finishing so that old process can be quite time-consuming because sometimes you have to go back and say wait a minute that's not exactly how I wanted it well that's one good thing about our God he thought it in the beginning he formulated a plan for the salvation of mankind he drew that plan and he is executing that plan and he never had to go back and say oops I didn't see that coming now I've got to erase something here and I've got to correct it here and make it a little different because circumstances won't allow it to be the way I own oh you see we're talking about a God who knew the end from the beginning in the beginning Oh so the design that God had for the earth in the beginning was perfect you say what about Lucifer what about sin what about murder what about evil what about all the things we read about in the Old Testament what about what we see going on today well this may not have been pleasing to God but God knew it he saw it he knew exactly how the enemy would raise up he knew how Lucifer's ambition would lead to a great darkness that would enter into men's hearts but again all of that a part of God's master design because he wanted to have fellowship with you and I he didn't just want to live above us he didn't want to just walk with us but ultimately God the God of eternity the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob that God wanted to live inside of us and part of that great big master plan part of everything that God wanted to accomplish in the end you're a part of that you're involved in that and we're seeing these things begin to draw to a final curtain call we know that according to the scripture the end time began when Jesus was manifested when he was born in the earth that started the end time well here we are two thousand years living in the end times and so what we often say is this it's not just the end time anymore we see scriptures being fulfilled very very often now I mean sometimes you have to really look deep to see what God is saying when you do by revelation you find that it just fits the word that what you see going on in the news and in the world around you just fits the word it describes what God already knew about the hour that we're living in and as this plan unfolds we can now say we're living in the end of the end times and it's very very important for you to make Jesus the Lord of your life he's not just someone to have when you need him I want you to know God it's not just good when you need him God is good all the time he is a faithful faithful friend if you'll allow him to come into your life by the power of the Holy Spirit remember he wants to walk in you he wants to live in you and so this great architect this great design that God had the blue that God had in his mind from the beginning he could have done it quickly he could have D could have accomplished it in in one hour had he so desired but he allowed in such a way that it would take a a span of time and that God would reveal himself in every generation in a deeper and a deeper and a deeper way until one day the fullness of the time would come and when the fullness of the time would come somewhere around four thousand years after creation when that day came when that moment came that time was full and everything was in order for God to really begin what we could say the final act the final chapter in God's great book even though we said this started 2000 years ago I think it's very appropriate to call it the last chapter and in that last chapter here's what we see God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons I'm telling you God is a good God he is a faithful god when we when we you know start pondering and meditating on these things on the omniscience of God that he has all knowledge that he's all-knowing that he knew from eternity to eternity then it's hard to sometimes compare time with eternity time was also created by God for the purposes of eternity there was eternity before there was time do you understand that and when we look at the word time in the Bible there are several different Hebrew words and Greek words that are used that we see in our Bible translated simply as the word time one of those words is Chronos time and that means like a space of time a period of time with an action and a process a plan or a purpose occurs and that Chronos time is measured by an evening and a morning and when you take an evening and a morning the Bible said you have a day you want to chop this down Genesis 1:5 and God called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day that's Chronos time that's the kind of time that we observe by looking at our watch or checking the calendar Chronos expresses a duration of time passing a quantity of time then there's a word that is used and it is a Greek word and kahin Rose sometimes you hear it a pronounced Kairos time kahin Rose time is a little bit different than Chronos time you know we we are pretty sure how Chronos time works we have we have 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour we have 24 hours in a day we have 12 months of the year we have seven days in a week we're pretty sure that's how things are going to take on for sometime now right but this car hero's time or Kairos time it's a different kind of time it can run in conjunction with Chronos time gods seasons can actually run congruently with Chronos time absolutely his Sabbath is a a spiritual expression the Sabbath is an expression of God's rest but we can mark the Sabbath the same way that any other day is marked from sunset until the Sun is setting and then all the way through sunrise the evening and the morning are the first day so from sunset to sunset so that's Chronos but the Sabbath is not only Chronos but it's also kahin rose because that is a portion of time that God says I want to refresh you I want to restore you I want to renew you not only in body but also in mind so this Chi hero's time it seems to be a time of a season a cycle of heightened spiritual activity sometimes people will speak about seasons of revival maybe we talk about the great healing revival the voice of healing revival it's kind of hard to pin down exactly the moment it began exactly the moment it ended because it was a kahin rose time a god-ordained moment and this fullness of time it was it was marked in the Chronos but it was more of a spiritual timing when everything that God was waiting on he allowed it to just develop and flow and go forward all in his purpose all in his plan and on that day when everything was in order that the word was going to become flesh it was always God's mind always in his mind and always his purpose to come down in a body made of flesh we call it the condescension but it could not happen until everything else that God had purpose to happen to set the stage to make sure that every detail was in place so that it would have the maximum impact he waited for tyrants to rise and fall he waited on many variables that all had to just sort of begin to pen out and then that moment came in the fullness of the time God sent forth and how did he do that he did that by stepping out of eternity and into time what a plan what a plan maybe sometimes in your life you feel like you're tumbling you've fallen off the edge and you're just tumbling sometimes your head is up sometimes your heads down and your feet are up you're just tumbling out of control no plan for your life not knowing what your tomorrow holds I understand that feeling I know that that can be most overwhelming and it can even make you question whether you want to spend another day in this life but I want you to know that in that moment that you're tumbling out of control in that moment when it feels like nothing makes sense and there's going to be no way out of the confucian and the circumstances that surround you even in that moment I want you to know God knows he sees he may not like what's going on in your life it may not be of his creation he may not have created the circumstances that you're in in fact oftentimes we create our circumstances by decisions that we make but boy can that make us feel lonely when we get down in the in the pit and we're tumbling around so God may have not create did those circumstances but he's aware of them and he sees the way out he knew before you got here that you were gonna make like me some dumb choices along the way and in his sovereignty in his beautiful mind he knew there would be a way out he allowed things to to ebb and flow to fall into place in other words he's already seen your deliverance if you're sick right now and oppressed in body God's already seen your healing if you're bound and you can't break free something has taken ahold of your life and you don't seem to be able to break out of that bit I want you to know God has already seen your deliverance in fact it could be that this program today is an opportunity for you to make a giant step toward your deliverance by hearing this little gospel message and by calling on the name of the Lord their salvation there's deliverance there's healing there's hope there's peace in calling on the name of the Lord so no matter what our circumstances are right now God knew them he saw them you may feel like Chronos time is just ticking along and things are never going to get better for you but I want you to know there's another kind of time God has an appointed time there's an appointed season when the circumstances of your life reach their fullness and God says enough is enough it's time to launch you into the next chapter of what he has for you I'm gonna trust him I don't know about you but I'm gonna put my trust in him he's got a proven track record I can't ever remember a time that he's failed I can remember times that I have failed him but I can never remember a time that he failed me now let me be fair and say that I can member times that he came through at the last millisecond in that last moment when it felt like time was up it's over this is it and God stepped in I was nervous but he was never nervous in fact I didn't have the courage to ever say Lord you're late because God's timing is always right it might have felt late in my plans the way I was looking at things but in his plan in his great big beautiful mind it was the fullness of time it was the particularly is enough I am stepping in to those circumstances and into those details and I feel like there are people watching this program right now you know what I'm talking about I'm not teaching you something you don't know you know how God can show up in the nick of time because he's done that in your life so be encouraged you found yourself in another set of of depressing circumstances but be encouraged because as God broke through for you in the past he is more than able to break through for you again I am putting my trust in him everything has to come to its place of fruition to its place of fulfillment and then it often kicks in another level another installment of what God wants to do in the earth so to summarize just a moment 4000 years of time moving on God didn't step away he was always visiting man through the prophets through the through the worshipers of the Book of Psalms we we just see God constantly desiring to interact with his creation but after four thousand years a span of God's unfolding purposes and plans time got fool and God said it's time to go to the next chapter and how did he do that he did that by coming down by condescending by the word becoming flesh by God choosing to be born can you imagine that God who always was the God who always has been that god of eternity would now decide to be born to come into the womb of a little Jewish Maiden a virgin girl never touched by a man and God would come in to that little womb and he would manifest in fact he would create his own body he would create a physical body that the deity of God could dwell in that's how much he loved planet Earth for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that through him the world might be saved this is the good news and it's not just the good news in December this is the good news in January this is a good news in July it's the good news in August this isn't the good news that is specifically tied to one day of the year that we sometimes like to say the birthday of Jesus Christ I see people saying things like happy birthday Jesus I want you to know he's bigger than a birthday he is he's from eternity he only stepped into time for a period and then he steps back into eternity and beckons you and I to come to eternity where he is that's the Blessed hope that we have revelation chapter 10 verse 6 and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer this is a a word that is spoken prophetically about an hour when there will be no more delay when the last installment that last little cycle that God has already determined in his mind he saw it from eternity I believe that last work that God wants to do in planet Earth is in the racing up of Suns we can say that we love the Lord we can say that we that we're Christians some people say I was born a Christian I don't particularly believe that theology you may have been born again a Christian but I don't think we're born into this world born again we're born into this world we come here having been shapen in iniquity and formed in sin we need a savior but thank God we have one if we can see him if we can call on him if we recognize that he is as close as the prayer of repentance he wants to come in and do everything that we need him to do so Cronos time k heroes time hard a time which is another word that's expressed for a definite fixed a period or measurement of time or season a natural law it's the same kind of progression as Chronos time all of those kinds of time expressions of time there's coming an hour when they are no more when the God who created time will cause us all to step completely away from time into the dimension of eternity and like so many other things that are a part of our life that will not be a part of our life and eternity time is one of them we just we just slip away from it I'm telling you never to be weary never to be tired never to be sick never to say goodbye never to shed a tear someone said I just really can't believe that there is a place like that there is a state of being like that brother sister you have to believe you have to believe the other alternative is not worth mentioning you have to believe when you look around the world that we have right now and there's no way in the world you can watch this program today and and look around and see the world and say oh I just I believe it's all all just some kind of spontaneous process that got us here single-cell amoeba divided itself this way in that way and and and the next thing you know crawled out of the mud hole and now has become a nuclear physicist listen there's no way in the world that we are where we are in technology there's no way we could be where we are today apart from a divine creator apart from divine intelligence that allowed us to be where we are today and I'm going to when I recognize that I'm not here by accident I'm here as part of a divine design that makes me want to know how do I cooperate with the divine design how do I cooperate with that divine creator because if he can do all of this then he can do everything the book says he can do he can go to prepare a place for me that where he is I will one day be with him absent from all time only eternity only peace with him stress is it's a major factor in almost every person's life you may live a very simple life and still have those moments of great stress and strain so much responsibility and I want you to know that the only relief that I know the only relief that I have ever found I mean I I love gardening and I love being out in the Sun and I love you know enjoying nature there's a lot of things I enjoy but but but you can if you're not careful you can take your stress with you but what brings me the most peace is when I start meditating and reflecting on the goodness of God and his love for me what he means to me his proven track record in my own life I don't have to sit here today and tell you what only what I've read God did in the Bible or what I've heard that God did in the great healing revivals of of the last generation but I can sit here today and tell you I personally know the goodness of God in my own life he is more to me than the air that I breathe right now I know that He desires to be all of that in your life and he can only come in if you are willing to open up the door and let him in don't get so caught up in the trappings of any season of the year they often say around this time Jesus is the reason for the season let me tell you something Jesus is the reason for all seasons he's just the reason father I thank you today for the peace that comes in knowing you you have not placed us here on this earth and then turned your back on us but you are with us even in us by the power of the Holy Spirit and I pray for those watching this program today that they will also feel the sweetness of your presence that settled over me just a few moments ago I pray Lord somehow that in their home you would allow them to feel the sweetness of your presence and your love for them I pray O God but if they have closed the door in your face and not allowed you into their life that they would repent even now and invite you to come in and reveal your love and your plan and your purpose for their lives Lord if there's someone watching this right now that's tumbling as we described a few moments ago out of control and wondering whether or not another day on this earth is worth the living I pray right now in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you would touch them where they are and let them know that life is not worth living without a savior but with a savior knowing you Lord makes life worth the living you will be there to help them through the circumstances of their life that have caused them to tumble may they invite you in may they connect with someone who can offer them guidance and help them on the journey of serving you with newness of life that they would not have to feel alone in this hour I ask this in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior amen and amen god bless you you go and have an attitude of gratitude will you and we'll meet again here another time bye-bye for now [Music] [Applause] [Music]
