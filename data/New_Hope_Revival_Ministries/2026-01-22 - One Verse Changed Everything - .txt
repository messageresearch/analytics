Description:
One verse. No name, no title, no lineage—yet without him, Samson never reaches the pillars and deliverance never comes. God hides His greatest instruments in small verses and overlooked places. Not the strong, not the famous—just the available, the obedient, the aligned. This is the hour of generational partnership: a Moses generation carrying wisdom and a Joshua generation stepping into purpose. Overlooked, underestimated, uncelebrated—but divinely positioned. Ten came out with gripes; two came out with grapes. Which spirit will you carry?

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
He said to this little lad, held him by the hand and and he said, "Suffer me that I MAY FEEL THE pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may rest, that I may lean upon them." This little boy certainly played a small detail, but with a great prophetic weight in this story. Scripture gives only one verse to the lad. One verse changed the outcome. One verse made a difference in the future of an entire nation. There's no name, no title, no lineage, no record of his anointing, his calling, his God, his faith, his religion. NOBODY KNOWS. Yet without him, Samson never reaches the pillars. Without him, the Philistine system never collapses. Without him, the story ends in humiliation instead of deliverance. Without who? The lad. &gt;&gt; Somebody say the lad. &gt;&gt; The lad. &gt;&gt; God often hides his greatest end time instruments prophetically in small verses. Now I want to talk about for a moment who the lad is and who he's not. What the lad is not, he is not strong. He is not famous. He is not a judge. He is not anointed like Samson. He is not the chosen deliverer to begin the deliverance of Israel from the hands of the Philistines. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you what he is. He is available. &gt;&gt; He is obedient. &gt;&gt; He is aligned. &gt;&gt; He's strategically placed and he recognized something about Samson. HE KNEW SOMEHOW THAT WHATEVER HAD HAPPENED TO COST HIM HIS POWER. &gt;&gt; There had been a measurable CHANGE IN HIS DEMEANOR THESE LAST FEW WEEKS. &gt;&gt; And that little boy didn't want to miss it. I'm taking a little license. &gt;&gt; Forgive me. We all do. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T WANT TO MISS IT. SO HE WENT WITH HIM FROM THE PRISON HOUSE TO THE PLACE OF CELEBRATION AND HE WAS JUST WAITING ON ON an instruction placed right BESIDE HIM. GOD DOES NOT REQUIRE PROMINENCE TO POSITION SOMEONE PROPHETICALLY. ALL THAT IS NECESSARY TO BE POSITIONED PROPHETICALLY IS OBEDIENCE. This is a holy picture of a remnant bride church in the last days. &gt;&gt; A remnant church is overlooked. It's underestimated. It's unseleelebrated, but it's divinely positioned. There's a generational partnership that God is setting up right here in this hour with a generation that has seemingly passed their prime and a generation that is not yet stepped into the fullness of their why, the reason why they were born. And yet both generations represent something that we can't move forward without. &gt;&gt; We're stuck in history. We're doomed to repeat the mistakes of the generations before us. If we miss this opportunity to watch God FUSE TOGETHER THE WISDOM OF A GENERATION THAT CAME OUT UNDER MOSES &gt;&gt; AND A GENERATION THAT WILL GO IN. MY GOD, I felt that. Woo! &gt;&gt; Is a GENERATION THAT HAS BEEN THERE AND DONE THAT. A GENERATION who had wisdom. A generation who has experience. a Moses generation AND A JOSHUA GENERATION that's just emerging. &gt;&gt; I don't WANT YOU TO SPEND ONE MOMENT WORRIED ABOUT am I of THE MOSES GENERATION OR AM I OF the Joshua generation? Because remember JOSHUA HIMSELF was part of the Moses generation. &gt;&gt; JOSHUA AND CALEB, &gt;&gt; 12 WENT IN. &gt;&gt; YES. 12 came out, &gt;&gt; 10 came out with gripes. &gt;&gt; Two came out with grapes. &gt;&gt; God said, "I'm going to use those men." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO USE A JOSHUA. I'M GOING TO USE EVEN A CALEB. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; THEY were of a DIFFERENT SPIRIT. THEY WERE OF AN OLDER GENERATION, BUT THEY WERE OF A DIFFERENT SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; IF GOD SAID, "I'M GOING TO HAVE A MOUNTAIN," CALEB SAID, "I'M going to have A MOUNTAIN. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF I'M 80. I DON'T CARE IF I'M 90. I DON'T CARE IF I'M 100. IF GOD SAID HE'S GOING TO GIVE ME A MOUNTAIN, I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL I GET MY MOUNTAIN. &gt;&gt; SO, don't you WORRY ABOUT WHICH generation you're in. &gt;&gt; SERVE GOD. DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO HELP THE synergy &gt;&gt; that is FORMING BETWEEN A MOSES, A PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT UNDER A MOSES ministry and a people who will go in &gt;&gt; under a Joshua ministry.
