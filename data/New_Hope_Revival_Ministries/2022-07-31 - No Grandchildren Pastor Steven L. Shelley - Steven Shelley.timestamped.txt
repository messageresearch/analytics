[1:09:11] it then and i appreciate it now
[1:09:13] and brother
[1:09:15] brooks preached real good and then
[1:09:18] sister anna's brother brother cliff
[1:09:19] farmer he did some really good
[1:09:22] preaching
[1:09:24] he was just shrinking his opportunities
[1:09:27] every other paragraph
[1:09:32] yes he was not preaching the kind of
[1:09:34] message that gets you invited
[1:09:37] so you have to make up your mind what's
[1:09:40] important obeying god
[1:09:42] or getting put on the on the posters
[1:09:46] and uh i appreciated it very very much
[1:09:49] and then i got to i was studying last

[1:10:16] different uh that's of a different level

[1:10:22] the music world would like to get a hold
[1:10:23] of a song like that that song
[1:10:27] it's of a different level
[1:10:28] it comes from a different place
[1:10:31] and i really really appreciated the
[1:10:34] anointing and i

[1:12:04] week with sister weems and royale it was
[1:12:06] so wonderful to be in her home and and
[1:12:08] feel that if you've you've ever had an
[1:12:10] opportunity to be there you get to feel
[1:12:12] that wonderful peace that wonderful
[1:12:14] presence of the lord
[1:12:16] we started praying and we went through
[1:12:18] the whole family and then we went
[1:12:20] through the whole campground
[1:12:21] we're just praying for every house house
[1:12:23] by house
[1:12:25] that god will do his best for each and
[1:12:28] every one he's just faithful that way
[1:12:31] amen
[1:12:33] how many of you appreciate a service
[1:12:35] where there's just no hindrance
[1:12:38] i appreciate that
[1:12:40] let me show you what i found this week i
[1:12:43] was praying about something
[1:12:45] and i want to read you this it won't
[1:12:46] take but just a moment they don't have
[1:12:48] it up there they might could pull it up
[1:12:50] i don't know it's from a message 1960
[1:12:53] the 10 virgins
[1:12:55] and the 144 000 jews
[1:12:58] 12 11 60 in the morning
[1:13:01] this is not my message but this was my
[1:13:04] life
[1:13:05] for several years
[1:13:07] and i want to give god thanks this
[1:13:09] morning i don't want to hurt anybody's
[1:13:10] feelings but i want to give god thanks
[1:13:12] this morning that it's not my life
[1:13:14] anymore
[1:13:16] and should it ever rise up again we
[1:13:18] won't wait nearly as long
[1:13:20] to do something about it
[1:13:22] paragraph three
[1:13:24] he's uh
[1:13:26] talking to us about
[1:13:28] atmosphere a little bit and he says in
[1:13:31] paragraph i believe it's paragraph three
[1:13:33] i may have took a number off
[1:13:36] he said see
[1:13:38] if you've got a resenting audience
[1:13:42] the holy spirit won't even reveal
[1:13:47] you got to have something that working
[1:13:50] together
[1:13:52] he said they were in one place and in
[1:13:55] one accord
[1:13:58] and then there came a sound from heaven
[1:14:02] rushing see
[1:14:04] but but he said when you got no matter
[1:14:06] how much i'd pray this brother branham
[1:14:08] talking
[1:14:10] no matter how much i'd pray
[1:14:13] and lay day and night studying and
[1:14:16] praying before the lord
[1:14:19] walk down here
[1:14:21] maybe the anointing on me
[1:14:24] walk up here and feel that resentment
[1:14:28] see
[1:14:30] he just it just grieves him
[1:14:34] right away
[1:14:35] [Music]
[1:14:39] it's awful to get in that shape
[1:14:42] husbands can sometimes get in a place
[1:14:44] where they resent their wives
[1:14:47] wives can sometimes get in a place where
[1:14:49] they resent their husbands children
[1:14:52] parents parents children church families
[1:14:55] resenting one another
[1:14:57] you can't get rid of your family
[1:15:00] but i tell you it's not a smart idea to
[1:15:02] stay in a church where you resent the
[1:15:04] leader
[1:15:06] if you resent the pastor and nothing can
[1:15:09] seem to make it any better eventually
[1:15:12] you've got to do something for your
[1:15:13] family if you love them like you say you
[1:15:16] do
[1:15:16] you've got to do something on their
[1:15:18] behalf and you know that ought not to
[1:15:20] hurt anybody's feelings
[1:15:22] it's just the way it works
[1:15:25] the best ideas to get prayed through
[1:15:27] over that let that resentment go and
[1:15:29] receive from whoever god's placed you
[1:15:31] with but if you can't
[1:15:33] it's not right to let that hinder the
[1:15:35] whole thing
[1:15:36] he goes on he said maybe the anointing
[1:15:39] on me walk up here and feel that
[1:15:40] resentment it just grieves him right
[1:15:42] away he won't reveal nothing
[1:15:45] it shuts the gift down
[1:15:48] he said but when you walk down here
[1:15:50] listen when you walk down here in under
[1:15:52] the anointing and feel your audience
[1:15:56] under the anointing
[1:15:59] somebody's been praying somebody's been
[1:16:01] listening to the word this week somebody
[1:16:04] prayed before they came today
[1:16:06] somebody got under hallelujah
[1:16:09] somebody got under the anointing he said
[1:16:11] that's when the holy spirit begins to
[1:16:13] work then and he begins to move and do
[1:16:16] great things for us
[1:16:19] so you see
[1:16:21] i'll tell you that is the goodness of
[1:16:22] god
[1:16:23] amen and as soon as we got out from
[1:16:26] under that resentful spirit god began to
[1:16:28] do some things
[1:16:29] and he began to send this one and that
[1:16:31] one and this one and this one and that
[1:16:33] when we're working on 13
[1:16:36] 13 that god has sent to be a part of
[1:16:38] this church since the first week of
[1:16:40] april
[1:16:42] that's the goodness of god
[1:16:44] and we're looking for others to join
[1:16:46] them
[1:16:47] we believe god's doing something
[1:16:49] so i ha i found that and it helped me so
[1:16:52] much i wanted to share it with you let's

[1:19:01] someone from lexington georgia
[1:19:05] i'm not even sure exactly where that is
[1:19:09] up there somewhere we'll just say like
[1:19:10] we always say
[1:19:12] somewhere near atlanta
[1:19:14] if we don't know where it is is it is it
[1:19:17] up that way lexington do you all know if
[1:19:19] we don't know where something is we just
[1:19:20] so it's up there somewhere near atlanta
[1:19:24] john 3 there was a man verse 1 there was
[1:19:27] a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a
[1:19:29] ruler of the jews
[1:19:31] and the same came to jesus by night and
[1:19:34] said unto him rabbi we know that thou
[1:19:37] art a teacher come from god for no man
[1:19:40] can do these miracles that thou doest
[1:19:42] except god be with him and jesus
[1:19:46] answered and said unto him verily verily
[1:19:49] i say unto thee except a man be born
[1:19:53] again
[1:19:54] he cannot see the kingdom of god
[1:19:59] nicodemus sayeth unto him how can a man
[1:20:02] be born when he is old can he enter the
[1:20:06] second time into his mother's womb and
[1:20:08] be born
[1:20:09] jesus answered verily verily i say unto
[1:20:13] thee except a man be born of water and
[1:20:16] of the spirit he cannot enter
[1:20:20] into the kingdom of god
[1:20:23] now that's powerful
[1:20:25] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[1:20:28] that which is born of the spirit is what
[1:20:31] it is spirit marvel not
[1:20:34] that i said unto thee you must be born
[1:20:36] again
[1:20:37] the wind bloweth where it listeth and
[1:20:39] thou hearest the sound thereof but can't
[1:20:42] not tell whence it cometh and whither it
[1:20:44] goeth so is everyone that is born
[1:20:47] of the spirit
[1:20:50] may god add his blessing to the reading
[1:20:53] of his word you may be seated
[1:20:56] i want you to turn with me now
[1:21:00] if you will
[1:21:01] to romans chapter 10
[1:21:05] and verse 9
[1:21:08] that if thou shalt confess
[1:21:13] with thy mouth the lord jesus
[1:21:16] and shall believe in thine heart
[1:21:20] that god hath raised him from the dead
[1:21:24] thou
[1:21:26] shalt
[1:21:27] be
[1:21:28] saved
[1:21:29] you know that ought not to be old news
[1:21:32] that ought to be what it is good news
[1:21:35] and fresh news
[1:21:38] it may have been a lifetime ago that you
[1:21:41] trusted in those words
[1:21:43] applied them to your life and made your
[1:21:46] confession unto the lord but i want you
[1:21:49] to know there still as brother robert
[1:21:51] was praying here this morning there are
[1:21:53] still many people that hadn't made it
[1:21:55] this far
[1:21:56] come on now
[1:21:58] and so brother branham gave us that that
[1:22:01] abc's
[1:22:02] you accept it as the truth you believe
[1:22:05] it in your heart
[1:22:08] and then you confess it with your mouth
[1:22:11] the a b c's of salvation accept believe
[1:22:17] confess
[1:22:18] and when we do that he said right here
[1:22:20] that if thou shalt confess with thy
[1:22:24] mouth the lord jesus
[1:22:26] and shall believe in thine heart that
[1:22:30] god hath raised him from the dead thou
[1:22:34] shalt be
[1:22:36] saved there's no if ands or buts no
[1:22:39] maybe souls about it if you will do that
[1:22:42] and be sincere in your heart you will
[1:22:47] be saved
[1:22:49] those who call upon the name of the lord
[1:22:52] the bible said and that's with faith
[1:22:54] attached
[1:22:55] that's believing that it's going to make
[1:22:57] a difference in your life you will be
[1:23:00] saved nicodemus a ruler of in the law he
[1:23:04] found out that there was only one way
[1:23:07] not by trusting the law
[1:23:09] not by trusting the covering of sin that
[1:23:12] the law provided but he found out there
[1:23:15] was only one way to see and inherit
[1:23:18] you see i don't want to just see the
[1:23:19] kingdom of god
[1:23:21] many people can see it afar off but i'll
[1:23:23] never walk into it but i want to be one
[1:23:26] of those who sees the kingdom and one
[1:23:29] who inherits the kingdom
[1:23:31] jesus was talking to nicodemus like that
[1:23:34] he said you've got to be born again
[1:23:37] nicodemus couldn't understand it i
[1:23:39] preached this
[1:23:40] not too long ago we went through a
[1:23:43] sermon or two on being born again i'm
[1:23:46] not going to spend much time there but i
[1:23:49] wanted to use it as a foundation because
[1:23:52] it's a very powerful truth to be born
[1:23:55] from above
[1:23:56] it's a very powerful truth and we want
[1:23:59] to thank god for that let me read the
[1:24:01] end time evangelism before we get good
[1:24:03] and started here paragraph 57
[1:24:07] brother branham is preaching on this
[1:24:09] born-again thing and he said jesus said
[1:24:13] ye must be born again
[1:24:16] he said in order to be born again
[1:24:19] it's letting yourself go
[1:24:24] how many of you know who the hindrance
[1:24:26] is
[1:24:27] oh the church likes to tell you the
[1:24:29] devil is the big hindrance
[1:24:31] but i want you to know sometimes the
[1:24:33] biggest hindrance between you and a
[1:24:35] closer walk with god is not the devil at
[1:24:38] all
[1:24:40] sometimes it's you in the way
[1:24:42] it's me that gets in the way
[1:24:45] so brother branham said it's letting
[1:24:46] yourself go and dying and it doesn't
[1:24:49] mean that physical death it means dying
[1:24:52] to your own will to your own desires to
[1:24:56] your own ways maybe you pick somebody
[1:24:59] out and god picks somebody else out
[1:25:02] maybe you choose a career and god
[1:25:04] chooses a job
[1:25:09] come on now
[1:25:11] maybe you choose a popular church
[1:25:13] and god said oh no
[1:25:16] you're going to go down there to the one
[1:25:18] that when you when you're traveling up
[1:25:20] through chicago the devil knows you're
[1:25:22] there
[1:25:25] i keep preaching about you're going to
[1:25:26] be a few gr kind of gathered with the
[1:25:29] despised ones
[1:25:31] you see what we have to do is let go
[1:25:35] of ourself
[1:25:37] and we have to go ahead and die
[1:25:39] and the spirit of christ come into you
[1:25:42] you cannot make it with your own spirit
[1:25:46] you can only make it with his spirit
[1:25:49] are you with me
[1:25:51] the spirit of christ coming into you he
[1:25:54] said then you're no more yours
[1:25:59] so when you say i am my own man no
[1:26:02] you're not if you've been born again
[1:26:04] you don't belong to yourself
[1:26:07] you're bought with a price
[1:26:09] the precious blood of jesus christ
[1:26:12] you're a servant not the self but to the
[1:26:15] savior
[1:26:17] he said then you're no more yours
[1:26:19] it's christ
[1:26:21] in you
[1:26:22] isn't that what our brother was singing
[1:26:27] can a man have christ and not be changed
[1:26:33] it's impossible
[1:26:35] can a man have christ in his life in
[1:26:38] fullness and thirst for the world and
[1:26:41] hunger for the sinful ways of this life
[1:26:44] no
[1:26:46] because when christ comes in
[1:26:49] and he comes in to stay
[1:26:51] and you build him a place
[1:26:54] and you make him welcome in your life
[1:26:56] he's going to deliver you it may be
[1:26:58] degree by degree it may be level by
[1:27:01] level it may be inch by inch but you're
[1:27:04] going to come forth with deliverance in
[1:27:07] your life
[1:27:10] i love i tell you those words i'm
[1:27:12] thinking back now again to the lyrics of
[1:27:14] that song i've i've heard that that the
[1:27:18] question only causes confusion it's
[1:27:20] according to who you're asking the
[1:27:22] questions
[1:27:23] if you're asking us preachers we might
[1:27:26] confuse you but if you're going to your
[1:27:28] papa
[1:27:30] and you're saying why am i thus
[1:27:34] why am i in this mess
[1:27:36] and you listen to him you lay your head
[1:27:39] i'm going to preach in a minute
[1:27:41] you lay your head on his chest and let
[1:27:44] him talk to your heart
[1:27:46] he wants to tell you why you're where
[1:27:48] you are
[1:27:50] he not only wants to reveal do you why
[1:27:52] you're where you are but he wants to
[1:27:54] reveal to you a way to get out
[1:27:57] and a way to come up higher
[1:27:59] because there's more for you
[1:28:01] are you with me
[1:28:03] he goes on
[1:28:05] let me i want to make sure i finish that
[1:28:07] quote
[1:28:11] you're no more yours
[1:28:13] it's christ in you
[1:28:15] see the holy spirit
[1:28:17] paul said i die daily
[1:28:19] yet i live
[1:28:21] not i
[1:28:23] but christ liveth in me
[1:28:26] see christ
[1:28:27] this this life that i now live is not my
[1:28:29] life
[1:28:31] i'm not overcoming with my life
[1:28:34] i'm overcoming with his life i didn't
[1:28:36] hear you
[1:28:38] amen now i want to go to the 70 of the
[1:28:40] week of daniel just real quick and catch
[1:28:42] a paragraph don't get bored yet
[1:28:45] paragraph 28 i want to catch this one
[1:28:47] here
[1:28:48] he said and here in the audience and out
[1:28:50] in the land where the tapes will go
[1:28:53] there will probably be tens of thousands
[1:28:56] of born-again christians hear this
[1:28:58] and we know father that when we are born
[1:29:02] again he's praying
[1:29:04] that our spirit is what
[1:29:07] born from above you know that's what it
[1:29:11] means in the greek when you look up the
[1:29:13] greek words for born again it literally
[1:29:16] means to be born from above
[1:29:20] because there is a
[1:29:22] i'm getting too
[1:29:29] only preachers will understand
[1:29:32] sometimes you get so excited for what
[1:29:34] you're going to do what you're going to
[1:29:36] say
[1:29:37] [Music]
[1:29:38] i was getting excited over what i hadn't
[1:29:40] said yet
[1:29:41] and my heart was about to take off out
[1:29:43] of my chest
[1:29:46] it was beating so fast i'm thinking if i
[1:29:48] don't let me have a little water here i
[1:29:50] don't want to
[1:29:51] i don't hit the floor you know i feel
[1:29:53] well but i just feel excited for some
[1:29:56] reason it's all right won't hurt us
[1:30:01] he said father
[1:30:03] that when we are born again that our
[1:30:05] spirit
[1:30:06] is born from above
[1:30:11] hmm
[1:30:13] i could say a lot
[1:30:15] about where they like to place the soul
[1:30:17] in the spirit i could say a lot
[1:30:19] but i won't
[1:30:21] he's just quoting jesus here jesus
[1:30:23] placed it right where it belongs he said
[1:30:26] father that when we are born again that
[1:30:28] our spirit is born from above
[1:30:32] remember he tells us that the soul is
[1:30:35] the nature of the spirit
[1:30:38] which really means that the soul
[1:30:41] reflects
[1:30:44] what has happened in the spirit
[1:30:47] now when they hear that quote they take
[1:30:49] it in an entirely different direction
[1:30:51] altogether
[1:30:52] and they say that places that places
[1:30:56] uh soul inside of spirit
[1:30:59] but that's not what he is saying he's
[1:31:01] saying that the nature of the spirit is
[1:31:04] the soul meaning if you want to know
[1:31:06] what's going on in the spirit
[1:31:09] you watch what the soul is doing
[1:31:12] [Music]
[1:31:14] because the soul is mind
[1:31:17] will and emotions
[1:31:19] and if you're operating out of a spirit
[1:31:22] born from above
[1:31:24] a spirit that has come directly from
[1:31:27] christ how many of you know that spirit
[1:31:29] will have some governance it will have
[1:31:32] some authority in your mind and your
[1:31:35] will and your emotions did you know
[1:31:37] sometimes it's just pausing a minute
[1:31:41] that would save us from a lot of
[1:31:42] heartache
[1:31:44] not reacting emotionally
[1:31:47] but reacting with wisdom
[1:31:50] because we took a deep breath
[1:31:55] it's good to breathe
[1:31:58] it's good to breathe
[1:32:00] i could go somewhere with that but i
[1:32:01] better go on now
[1:32:03] that our spirit is born from above it is
[1:32:06] the spirit of god the holy spirit upon
[1:32:08] us and we realize that the holy spirit
[1:32:11] is all
[1:32:12] powerful anybody believe that
[1:32:15] and can do anything for us that we
[1:32:19] desire to be done
[1:32:22] when you have the holy spirit inside of
[1:32:26] you you have the endless resources of
[1:32:29] god
[1:32:31] whatever you need is available to you
[1:32:34] from the inside
[1:32:36] he said it we know father oh that's it
[1:32:39] isn't that the end of that one
[1:32:42] then heavenly father we would ask you
[1:32:46] to release our faith to that spirit
[1:32:50] that it might be able to secure for us
[1:32:53] this morning and for the glory of the
[1:32:55] kingdom of god all these requests and
[1:32:59] desires that we might be healed of our
[1:33:03] sickness and our afflictions that we
[1:33:05] might serve our god with all
[1:33:09] that's in us
[1:33:11] you see how many people respond
[1:33:14] did you feel how many people responded
[1:33:16] to such a simple prayer why don't we
[1:33:18] read it again then heavenly father we
[1:33:21] would ask you to release our faith to
[1:33:23] that spirit that it might be able to
[1:33:26] secure for us this morning and for the
[1:33:29] glory of the kingdom of god all these
[1:33:32] requests and desires that we might be
[1:33:34] healed of our sicknesses and our
[1:33:37] afflictions that we might serve our god
[1:33:41] with all that's in us
[1:33:44] isn't that humble
[1:33:46] isn't that humble isn't that just where
[1:33:48] we ought to be this morning when we
[1:33:50] approach him
[1:33:52] all right and then i want to go to one
[1:33:54] more before we move into something else
[1:33:56] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:33:59] and forever are you still awake
[1:34:02] paragraph five
[1:34:04] so therefore
[1:34:06] no man
[1:34:08] could save another
[1:34:10] i want you to hear me
[1:34:14] how many of you have ever won someone to
[1:34:16] the lord led somebody to christ
[1:34:19] the bible said he that wenteth souls
[1:34:22] is wise
[1:34:24] if you've never led somebody else to
[1:34:26] christ you ought to get up
[1:34:29] and get busy
[1:34:33] because one of the evidences of the holy
[1:34:35] ghost is a travail of souls
[1:34:38] when somebody else's condition begins to
[1:34:41] pull on you
[1:34:43] and your soul begins to travail for
[1:34:46] their soul
[1:34:47] you can say that's the work of the holy
[1:34:49] spirit in your life
[1:34:51] and it's a joy it's a privilege i don't
[1:34:53] think we ought to do it like notches on
[1:34:55] our belt
[1:34:57] to compare ourselves with one another
[1:35:00] but i think every one of us ought to
[1:35:02] have a desire to lead somebody to christ
[1:35:05] but you cannot save them
[1:35:09] mama can't save you
[1:35:11] you're listening
[1:35:13] daddy can't save you
[1:35:15] your pastor can't save you the bishop
[1:35:19] can't save you
[1:35:22] the missionary can't save you
[1:35:25] the prophet can't save you pastor can't
[1:35:28] save you
[1:35:30] so therefore no man could save another
[1:35:33] if it would have been so
[1:35:36] jesus
[1:35:37] would not had to
[1:35:40] die
[1:35:42] if people could be born again or be
[1:35:44] saved or whatever you want to call it by
[1:35:46] all of these different ideas they have
[1:35:48] come up with in the message then jesus
[1:35:51] would have never had to die
[1:35:54] but he had to die
[1:35:57] but when jesus died at calvary he
[1:36:00] settled
[1:36:04] he settled the sin
[1:36:06] question for how long
[1:36:09] forever
[1:36:10] he said the price was paid
[1:36:13] completely
[1:36:15] it was so met that god identified
[1:36:19] that it was true
[1:36:22] he goes on to say now the only thing we
[1:36:24] have to do to receive this there it is
[1:36:28] it's to accept it
[1:36:29] to believe it and accept it but no
[1:36:32] matter how much that he died for our
[1:36:34] salvation
[1:36:36] you need to start listening in here
[1:36:38] we're getting to the place where i want
[1:36:39] you to catch this he said we must
[1:36:42] ourself
[1:36:44] accept it
[1:36:47] as
[1:36:49] our
[1:36:55] i'm sick and tired of hearing them say
[1:36:59] you better watch those experiences
[1:37:06] they love to talk about
[1:37:08] experiences
[1:37:12] but don't forget that every quote must
[1:37:16] be balanced
[1:37:18] with everything else he said
[1:37:21] one of these days if i live long enough
[1:37:24] i'm going to come out on a series i have
[1:37:27] i've got 30 pages of notes where quotes
[1:37:30] contradict one another it
[1:37:32] appears until you come to an
[1:37:35] understanding that the reason why it was
[1:37:37] preached that way is to make sure that
[1:37:39] you and i have the balance between the
[1:37:41] two
[1:37:43] not so that we stand and say that one's
[1:37:45] wrong it's not wrong
[1:37:47] it's just so that we can have the
[1:37:48] balance
[1:37:50] i mentioned one of those to you the
[1:37:52] other night tuesday night in fact i
[1:37:53] think where they oh they just had it all
[1:37:55] over social media where brother bannon
[1:37:57] said where there will be gifts
[1:38:00] there will be confusion
[1:38:02] well i just think that's grand
[1:38:05] but you cannot take that and say then we
[1:38:08] don't need the gifts
[1:38:09] because brother branham says over and
[1:38:12] over and over and over
[1:38:15] there's five gifts given to the church
[1:38:19] apostle prophet pastor teacher and
[1:38:21] evangelist and then he said there are
[1:38:24] nine spiritual gifts given in the church
[1:38:29] that must be there
[1:38:32] to keep the church clean
[1:38:38] i've got about 50 pages
[1:38:42] of quotes where he says that
[1:38:44] over and over and over again so you
[1:38:46] can't go off and take one and say see we
[1:38:49] don't need the gifts because where the
[1:38:51] gifts are
[1:38:53] there's just confusion
[1:38:57] what do you have to do
[1:38:59] you got to balance it out
[1:39:01] brother green brother branham turns to
[1:39:03] brother green whatever you do brother
[1:39:05] perry
[1:39:06] keep your balance
[1:39:09] in
[1:39:09] the scriptures
[1:39:13] you want to find where the balance is
[1:39:15] you lay the quote against the quote and
[1:39:17] then you take it right back to the word
[1:39:19] and see what the word has said
[1:39:22] then you find the balance between the
[1:39:24] two and you can say amen to both of them
[1:39:27] when i read that that where the gifts
[1:39:29] are there there can be confusion i say
[1:39:32] amen
[1:39:33] because it certainly can be that way but
[1:39:35] when i read him where he said all nine
[1:39:38] gifts should be in operation i say amen
[1:39:44] i'm glad you're helping me
[1:39:46] because i'm fixing to come to one of
[1:39:47] those in just a minute here
[1:39:49] stay with me he said now the only thing
[1:39:52] we have to do to receive this is to
[1:39:54] accept it and believe it and accept it
[1:39:56] but no matter how much that he died for
[1:39:58] our salvation we must ourself accept it
[1:40:02] as our
[1:40:04] own personal experience i'm asking you
[1:40:08] this morning have you had your own
[1:40:11] personal experience with jesus christ
[1:40:16] our own desire he goes on to say let's
[1:40:19] read
[1:40:21] we must want to be saved
[1:40:24] and believe that upon the basis of his
[1:40:26] shed blood that we are saved
[1:40:30] after we have met the requirements of
[1:40:32] the bible
[1:40:35] paragraph seven he said i believe in the
[1:40:37] bible being the full revelation of jesus
[1:40:39] christ now i do believe that god can do
[1:40:42] things
[1:40:43] that's not written in the bible
[1:40:47] because he's god
[1:40:49] oh that'll get religious feathers
[1:40:51] ruffling
[1:40:53] oh somebody said well god couldn't do
[1:40:55] that it's not in the bible
[1:40:59] your bible is not god
[1:41:02] your bible is the written record of
[1:41:04] god's word
[1:41:06] but your bible isn't god
[1:41:08] somebody said wait a minute now the word
[1:41:10] became flesh and dwelt among us that's
[1:41:12] right
[1:41:13] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:41:15] word was with god and the word was god
[1:41:16] and the word became flesh that's right a
[1:41:19] flesh
[1:41:20] word
[1:41:21] a living
[1:41:23] word
[1:41:25] you could say jesus is the word
[1:41:27] you can say that your bible contains the
[1:41:30] word
[1:41:35] but god is not limited to the written
[1:41:37] record
[1:41:39] he's a god who is able to do exceedingly
[1:41:42] abundantly above that which we could
[1:41:44] even ask her to
[1:41:48] come on
[1:41:51] sometimes it's just a little bit of
[1:41:52] semantics
[1:41:55] someone heard us praying
[1:41:57] that god would return to us something
[1:41:59] that was lost
[1:42:01] and we were calling it back
[1:42:03] and someone said that's not even in the
[1:42:05] bible
[1:42:06] how dare you to pray a prayer like that
[1:42:08] i said listen if god can make an axe
[1:42:11] head swim
[1:42:14] god can put a credit card back in my
[1:42:16] pocket
[1:42:20] sometime you just need to relax a little
[1:42:22] bit
[1:42:24] know that god is a big god he said but
[1:42:27] as long as we can find it in the bible
[1:42:29] as a promise we know it's true because
[1:42:31] the word is true always so we believe
[1:42:34] him to keep
[1:42:38] to keep us from us
[1:42:39] are you folks ready to go home yet are
[1:42:42] you sure
[1:42:45] because i'm going to start my message
[1:42:46] now
[1:42:48] genesis 17 would you turn there with me
[1:42:51] genesis 17.
[1:42:54] and when abram was 90 years old in nine
[1:42:57] the lord appeared to abram
[1:43:00] and said unto him
[1:43:03] i
[1:43:04] am
[1:43:06] the mighty
[1:43:08] i am the
[1:43:10] almighty god
[1:43:14] walk before me
[1:43:17] and be thou
[1:43:20] perfect
[1:43:22] i'm going to read it again and when
[1:43:24] abram was 90 years old and 9 that's 99
[1:43:28] if you don't want to do the math
[1:43:30] the lord appeared to abram and said unto
[1:43:32] him i am
[1:43:35] el shaddai
[1:43:39] that's it
[1:43:41] that's the first time it mentions
[1:43:44] i
[1:43:46] am
[1:43:47] oh mighty god i am el shaddai
[1:43:55] doesn't matter whether you say el
[1:43:57] shaddai or el shaddai
[1:44:02] in the old pentecost church they like to
[1:44:04] add syllables to every biblical word
[1:44:09] so they'd always say el shaddai
[1:44:13] it did have a good ring
[1:44:16] but it's el shaddai
[1:44:19] the almighty god i am el shaddai
[1:44:23] walk before me
[1:44:25] and be thou perfect does that excite
[1:44:27] anybody does anybody believe he still
[1:44:30] else should i
[1:44:31] you don't think he quit being el shaddai
[1:44:33] when he became jesus do you
[1:44:35] don't you know that he's still el
[1:44:37] shaddai
[1:44:41] he's still out should i
[1:44:44] walk before me and be thou perfect i
[1:44:46] better hurry and i will make my covenant
[1:44:48] between me and thee and will multiply
[1:44:51] thee exceedingly and abram fell on his
[1:44:54] face and god talked with him saying
[1:44:58] as for me behold my covenant is with
[1:45:01] thee and thou shalt be a father of many
[1:45:04] nations neither shall thy name any more
[1:45:07] be called abram but thy name shall be
[1:45:12] abraham
[1:45:15] we say abraham
[1:45:17] in hebrew it's avraham
[1:45:22] it's the addition of the breath
[1:45:26] it's the addition of the ruach hakodesh
[1:45:31] in hebrew the holy spirit
[1:45:34] when when
[1:45:36] god appeared to abram he said i am el
[1:45:39] shaddai
[1:45:41] he was breathing his life
[1:45:44] on abram
[1:45:46] changing his name from avram to avraham
[1:45:50] so that his name would forever
[1:45:53] bear in it the breath
[1:45:57] of the name
[1:45:58] of god
[1:46:00] avram was having a personal experience
[1:46:06] with a living god
[1:46:08] it changed his life forever you'll never
[1:46:12] be called abram but thy name shall be
[1:46:15] called abraham for a father of many
[1:46:18] nations have i made thee
[1:46:21] period
[1:46:23] my grandmother
[1:46:25] sitting in birmingham alabama
[1:46:28] in 64 wasn't it
[1:46:31] the prophet of god is preaching and
[1:46:34] praying for the sick
[1:46:36] he turns his
[1:46:38] back
[1:46:39] to the audience and he takes a roll
[1:46:42] not too far from where she was sitting
[1:46:46] with his back to the audience he goes
[1:46:48] down that roll
[1:46:49] calling every person
[1:46:51] by name by gender
[1:46:54] telling each and every one of them what
[1:46:56] their need was
[1:46:58] telling some of them what the doctor
[1:47:00] said about them
[1:47:03] telling some of them what was in their
[1:47:05] purse
[1:47:08] then he began to speak a little bit
[1:47:11] about abram's name being abraham
[1:47:15] and god changing the name
[1:47:18] my grandmother was sitting there
[1:47:20] thinking my that is some interesting
[1:47:22] i've never seen anything quite like that
[1:47:24] in my life and all of a sudden this
[1:47:26] thought came to her mind and she spelled
[1:47:28] b-r-a-n-h-a-m
[1:47:34] seven letters
[1:47:38] it scared her so bad
[1:47:41] god was trying to give her a revelation
[1:47:44] of something that would have changed her
[1:47:46] life
[1:47:47] it took us many more years
[1:47:50] to get the revelation of what god was
[1:47:52] showing her the very sign of the messiah
[1:47:56] amen
[1:47:58] because the son of man jesus christ was
[1:48:01] present in the building
[1:48:03] not because brother branham was in the
[1:48:05] building but because the the son of man
[1:48:08] was revealing himself through a son of
[1:48:11] man
[1:48:12] and oh what a difference it makes when
[1:48:14] you understand listen when god breathes
[1:48:17] on you
[1:48:18] [Music]
[1:48:21] it changes everything
[1:48:23] you see i made that little quote before
[1:48:25] i was when i was first getting up here
[1:48:26] to make people nervous and people start
[1:48:28] start scattering but i want to tell you
[1:48:30] something you'd better take your stand
[1:48:36] this is an hour to take your stand
[1:48:40] you want to make sure that you have had
[1:48:43] a personal experience with god for
[1:48:47] yourself
[1:48:48] because he don't have any grandchildren
[1:48:51] no no let's read a little bit more
[1:48:54] just a little bit more and i will make
[1:48:57] the exceeding fruitful and i will make
[1:48:59] nations of thee and kings shall come out
[1:49:02] of thee and i will establish my covenant
[1:49:04] between me and thee and thy seed after
[1:49:07] thee in their generations for an
[1:49:09] everlasting covenant to be a god unto
[1:49:12] thee and to thy seed
[1:49:14] after thee and i will give unto thee
[1:49:17] unto thy seed after thee the land
[1:49:20] wherein thou art a stranger all the land
[1:49:23] of canaan for an everlasting possession
[1:49:26] and i will be
[1:49:29] their god
[1:49:31] god said unto abraham thou shall keep my
[1:49:33] covenant therefore you excuse me
[1:49:35] therefore thou and thy seed after thee
[1:49:38] in their generations this is my covenant
[1:49:41] which you shall keep between me and you
[1:49:43] and thy seed after thee
[1:49:45] every man shall every man child among
[1:49:48] you shall be circumcised and you shall
[1:49:51] circumcise the flesh of your foreskin
[1:49:54] and it shall be a token
[1:49:56] of the covenant
[1:49:58] betwixt me and you
[1:50:00] i won't read all the way to verse 14 as
[1:50:04] i had
[1:50:06] prepared to do
[1:50:08] you can read that for yourself
[1:50:10] now
[1:50:12] i said a moment ago
[1:50:15] that i want us to have the balance
[1:50:19] all right so in a message debate on
[1:50:21] tongues
[1:50:23] 1960
[1:50:25] paragraph two
[1:50:27] i want you to listen to this
[1:50:30] this is one they love
[1:50:32] i love them all
[1:50:35] but this is one they like to highlight
[1:50:38] now if i was a boy
[1:50:40] and i was under the tutor ship of my
[1:50:42] father and mother
[1:50:44] and you wanted to adopt me and i give
[1:50:46] you my knife now you've got my gift
[1:50:49] but not me
[1:50:51] see now
[1:50:52] tongues is a gift
[1:50:54] of the holy ghost
[1:50:56] there's no scripture in the bible that
[1:50:58] says it is the holy ghost amen
[1:51:01] it's a gift of the holy ghost now watch
[1:51:05] on acts 2 38 repent and be baptized
[1:51:07] every one of you in the name of jesus
[1:51:09] christ for the remission of your sins
[1:51:11] and ye shall receive the gift
[1:51:13] of the holy ghost
[1:51:16] i want you to listen to this read on
[1:51:24] because they were marveling
[1:51:27] because they heard every man speaking in
[1:51:30] his own language wherein he was born see
[1:51:32] and he said if you would repent
[1:51:35] you would receive that gift
[1:51:38] of the holy ghost now this is what i
[1:51:40] want you to get listen to he said now
[1:51:42] the gift of william branham
[1:51:44] is not william branham
[1:51:47] [Music]
[1:51:50] see he said now if you'll notice you say
[1:51:52] well the gift of god is the holy ghost
[1:51:55] the holy ghost is god
[1:51:59] so see how how you could couldn't use it
[1:52:01] there
[1:52:03] well to everything that i speak of
[1:52:06] it must land
[1:52:14] no real servant of god
[1:52:16] is going to be put off
[1:52:19] by you checking him with the word
[1:52:23] i won't receive it now i only receive
[1:52:25] when he tells me
[1:52:27] then he always clears it
[1:52:31] with the scripture
[1:52:33] if he didn't i would not believe it
[1:52:37] i want you to know that's the right way
[1:52:40] let god speak to your heart
[1:52:42] then you clear that with the word
[1:52:45] the word is the absolute
[1:52:49] that was the thing brother henry simmons
[1:52:51] told me so many years ago you've heard
[1:52:53] me mention it many times through the
[1:52:54] year he said brother shelly the same god
[1:52:56] that was talking to you in pentecost
[1:52:59] we'll talk to you now
[1:53:02] the same god that led you in the word
[1:53:04] then will lead you in the word now he
[1:53:06] said don't you go to the message to find
[1:53:08] your sermon
[1:53:09] this is what he told me
[1:53:11] he said don't you go to the quotes to
[1:53:12] find your message
[1:53:14] he said you do it like you've always
[1:53:15] done it you go to the word
[1:53:18] let god speak to you from the word
[1:53:21] and then he said then you go find the
[1:53:23] quotes to help magnify accentuate
[1:53:28] help help people to understand
[1:53:30] what the word said
[1:53:32] he said if you ever start doing it the
[1:53:34] other way you'll lose your calling and
[1:53:36] forfeit your gift
[1:53:41] that's god's order
[1:53:43] brother branham said that's the way he
[1:53:44] did it
[1:53:46] he told me all along the road he said if
[1:53:48] he did i would not believe it although
[1:53:50] as much as he's told me along the road
[1:53:52] still if he ever told me anything that
[1:53:54] wasn't scriptural it would not be right
[1:54:01] because the scripture is absolutely
[1:54:04] our
[1:54:05] basis
[1:54:07] this is what they love
[1:54:10] they love this so much
[1:54:12] [Music]
[1:54:14] that they won't read the rest
[1:54:18] they don't read those first two
[1:54:19] paragraphs
[1:54:21] they like this one so much they skip
[1:54:24] through all of that and they get to this
[1:54:26] one
[1:54:28] we cannot base
[1:54:30] our salvation upon sensations
[1:54:34] or experiences of others
[1:54:37] are on our own experience
[1:54:41] it's got to be the word of god see
[1:54:43] because that's the true mark
[1:54:46] and they'll preach two and a half to
[1:54:47] three hours
[1:54:50] on that
[1:54:54] see
[1:54:56] you'll hear them say see
[1:54:58] it's not by experience
[1:55:01] you just take the word believe the word
[1:55:05] that's it
[1:55:10] that's like saying where the gifts are
[1:55:13] there'll be confusion
[1:55:16] you've got to take it all
[1:55:20] and over and over and over and over i
[1:55:24] hear him say you must have your own
[1:55:29] experience
[1:55:30] with god
[1:55:34] so please take this in balance
[1:55:38] and understand that at the end of the
[1:55:40] road you cannot defeat the devil with a
[1:55:44] vision
[1:55:46] you cannot defeat the devil with a dream
[1:55:50] with a prophecy with a message in
[1:55:53] tongues
[1:55:54] but you can
[1:55:56] defeat the devil every day every minute
[1:56:00] of the day with the word
[1:56:03] [Music]
[1:56:05] so our salvation is not based on a
[1:56:08] feeling
[1:56:10] it's based on the word
[1:56:12] it's not based on an experience
[1:56:16] it's based on the word
[1:56:18] but without a personal experience you
[1:56:21] have never encountered the living god
[1:56:26] you are not born from above
[1:56:31] you are not born from above unless
[1:56:34] you've met him
[1:56:36] like abram met him
[1:56:39] now don't be offended
[1:56:41] when i do this
[1:56:43] don't be offended
[1:56:45] i'm not trying to be vulgar
[1:56:47] don't be offended
[1:56:50] this is how abraham met him
[1:56:53] you understand
[1:56:54] how many of you understand
[1:56:58] because one of the
[1:57:00] meanings of el shaddai
[1:57:03] is the many breasted one
[1:57:07] understand
[1:57:09] brother branham tells us he said it's
[1:57:10] double-breasted
[1:57:14] that's all right because he typed that
[1:57:16] he said old testament and new testament
[1:57:18] he said you've got to suck life from
[1:57:20] both
[1:57:20] just telling you don't be offended
[1:57:23] you've got to suck a lot but but the
[1:57:24] word didn't say two breasts it's or
[1:57:27] double breath the word
[1:57:29] is mini breast
[1:57:31] he is the mini breasted one
[1:57:34] do you understand that's how abraham met
[1:57:36] him
[1:57:37] now that's more than an experience
[1:57:40] that's god's saying i am carrying
[1:57:43] all you need
[1:57:47] lay your head son
[1:57:49] on my bosom
[1:57:51] and you will never be needy again
[1:57:55] [Music]
[1:57:57] come on
[1:57:58] now you all heard one of my friends come
[1:58:01] preach years ago paul keith came and he
[1:58:04] spoke about his encounter
[1:58:06] with a with a hebrew scholar a language
[1:58:09] scholar who said to him that that is
[1:58:12] only one phase
[1:58:15] of the meaning of el shaddai almighty
[1:58:18] god many breasted one
[1:58:21] he said there are many others
[1:58:24] you can research it and find many many
[1:58:26] many many explanations
[1:58:28] but i want to give you the one that that
[1:58:30] he emphasized and i think it's all
[1:58:32] powerful
[1:58:33] and i want to make sure that you
[1:58:34] understand that this is really what he
[1:58:36] is saying
[1:58:38] when when god said to
[1:58:40] abraham
[1:58:41] i am el shaddai
[1:58:44] and i'm here to change your life
[1:58:46] and change your name
[1:58:48] and give you a destiny that you don't
[1:58:50] know anything about
[1:58:52] he said
[1:58:53] that in saying
[1:58:55] or identifying himself as el shaddai
[1:58:58] he was saying are you with me
[1:59:01] i want you to be because in a moment
[1:59:03] you're going to want to be
[1:59:05] he said
[1:59:06] i am the god that can do for you
[1:59:11] what you cannot do for yourself
[1:59:16] that's who he is
[1:59:18] brother josh that's who he is
[1:59:20] i am the god who can do for you
[1:59:24] what you cannot do for yourself i'm the
[1:59:26] god who can provide for you what you
[1:59:29] cannot provide for yourself you can't
[1:59:31] nurse your own breasts
[1:59:34] but he said i've got
[1:59:36] everything you have need of come lay
[1:59:39] your head abram
[1:59:46] somebody give god a little praise here
[1:59:48] [Applause]
[1:59:56] so even though we cannot base our
[1:59:59] salvation on experiences it must be
[2:00:02] based on the word
[2:00:05] we know we've got to have our own
[2:00:06] experience
[2:00:07] if you know that say amen
[2:00:09] this day the scripture's fulfilled
[2:00:11] paragraph 91 is everybody still here
[2:00:14] i know it's a little slow going that's
[2:00:16] all right
[2:00:17] i i got another hour
[2:00:20] i hadn't broke into my first finish my
[2:00:22] first one yet
[2:00:23] so now
[2:00:25] man has a right to call himself thus
[2:00:31] until he's talked face to face with god
[2:00:36] on the backside of a desert somewhere
[2:00:39] where he met god himself
[2:00:42] he said and all the atheists in the
[2:00:45] world
[2:00:46] could not explain it away from him he
[2:00:50] was there
[2:00:51] he knowed it happened
[2:00:55] are you there
[2:00:56] now read that for me every christian
[2:00:59] should have that experience before they
[2:01:03] say anything about being a christian
[2:01:10] you can't base
[2:01:11] your salvation on an experience
[2:01:15] you base it on the word
[2:01:16] but you can't even call yourself a
[2:01:18] christian
[2:01:20] without an experience somebody said
[2:01:22] that's the balance
[2:01:24] that's where it balances
[2:01:26] we base everything on the word but
[2:01:28] you've got to accept that
[2:01:31] you've got to fellowship that word
[2:01:34] for yourself
[2:01:37] i think we get things a little cool up
[2:01:39] here on the platform i'm sweaty but i
[2:01:41] think it's taking my voice so will you
[2:01:43] adjust that just a tad and i see some a
[2:01:45] little bundle and some fanning and some
[2:01:47] bundled
[2:01:51] now
[2:01:53] i want to read why the message why
[2:01:56] is that a good one
[2:01:58] it is
[2:02:00] paragraph 154 please stay with me as
[2:02:04] david du plessis once said
[2:02:07] anybody know who david duplessis was
[2:02:10] his name was mr pentecost
[2:02:14] he was he became a great leader
[2:02:18] in the ecumenical movement
[2:02:21] he was called mr pentecost
[2:02:24] because wherever he went
[2:02:26] he represented pentecost
[2:02:29] and he will believe that everybody
[2:02:32] needed a pentecostal experience
[2:02:34] whether they were baptist or methodist
[2:02:36] or episcopalian or catholic or whoever
[2:02:39] they were
[2:02:41] so this was his idea
[2:02:43] brother branham knew him well been in
[2:02:46] meetings with him and he quoted him
[2:02:48] often
[2:02:50] and this is the one i want to emphasize
[2:02:53] to you in just a moment
[2:02:56] as david depressus once said give me
[2:02:58] just a little more in the monitor
[2:03:02] as david de plessis once said god
[2:03:06] don't have
[2:03:08] no
[2:03:10] grandchildren
[2:03:14] you're not born by your mother's
[2:03:16] experience listen to me young people
[2:03:18] especially
[2:03:20] you're not born into this thing by your
[2:03:22] mother's experience
[2:03:25] amen brother
[2:03:27] you're not born into this by your
[2:03:29] daddy's experience
[2:03:31] or your pastor's experience
[2:03:34] god don't have any grandchildren
[2:03:37] he said that's right
[2:03:39] he said that's where our pentecostal
[2:03:41] brethren are becoming their children
[2:03:44] come into church and just say well we're
[2:03:46] pentecostal because papa was
[2:03:52] you know where i'm going
[2:03:54] if papa was a pentecostal and got the
[2:03:56] baptism of the holy ghost you'll have to
[2:03:58] get it the same way papa did
[2:04:00] does anybody believe that
[2:04:02] you believe that wave your hand at me
[2:04:06] if papa was a pentecostal and got to
[2:04:08] baptism the holy ghost you'll have to
[2:04:09] get it the same way papa did he don't
[2:04:11] have grandchildren
[2:04:13] he just has sons and daughters
[2:04:18] not grandsons and granddaughters just
[2:04:21] sons
[2:04:22] and daughters it's true
[2:04:25] all right let's go on
[2:04:27] so you've got to do the same thing they
[2:04:29] did
[2:04:30] on the day of pentecost anybody believe
[2:04:32] that
[2:04:33] you've got to have the same experience
[2:04:36] now let's go back your salvation is not
[2:04:39] based on anybody else's experience or
[2:04:41] your own he said
[2:04:43] it's based on the word
[2:04:45] but here he is telling us you've got to
[2:04:48] have the same experience
[2:04:51] so don't come around and tell me you
[2:04:53] don't need an experience with god
[2:04:57] don't tell me you can't trust an
[2:04:58] experience if you have one that's based
[2:05:01] on the word you can
[2:05:03] and this is the kind that's based on the
[2:05:05] word
[2:05:06] he said you got to have the same thing
[2:05:08] they had that they had
[2:05:10] god let's read that together that
[2:05:12] sentence there god don't never change
[2:05:16] his
[2:05:18] program you know how they got it they
[2:05:21] got it
[2:05:23] they got it like a bunch of drunks
[2:05:30] very very few of our churches would ever
[2:05:32] be accused
[2:05:35] of too much carrying on
[2:05:38] [Music]
[2:05:42] very unlikely the neighbors would peer
[2:05:44] through the windows during worship time
[2:05:46] and say that's a bunch of drunk holy
[2:05:48] rollers
[2:05:50] because we have found a more reformed
[2:05:52] way
[2:05:54] don't tell me it's based on the word the
[2:05:55] book of psalms says it's not
[2:05:59] the book of psalms tells me how i must
[2:06:01] worship god
[2:06:03] amen shout unto god with a loud voice he
[2:06:07] said
[2:06:09] amen clap your hands he said to the lord
[2:06:12] yes sing
[2:06:15] praise him in the dance
[2:06:17] he said it praise him in the dance
[2:06:21] praise him on the high sounding symbols
[2:06:26] let everything that had breadth praise
[2:06:28] the lord
[2:06:35] we want to be reverent
[2:06:37] i love it when they say something like
[2:06:39] this we don't want to disturb
[2:06:43] the holy spirit
[2:06:46] and you know what if you could hear him
[2:06:48] talk you know what the holy spirit would
[2:06:50] say
[2:06:51] i so long to disturb you
[2:06:55] we don't want to disturb the holy ghost
[2:06:57] let me tell you something the holy ghost
[2:06:59] would love to disturb you
[2:07:01] he would love to disturb me
[2:07:04] he would love to throw me off of my
[2:07:06] routine
[2:07:07] and cause me to be filled with the
[2:07:10] breath and the life of almighty god
[2:07:14] are you here
[2:07:20] you've got to do the same thing they did
[2:07:22] on the day of pentecost you've got to
[2:07:23] have the same experience
[2:07:25] notice when this was too just just for
[2:07:27] you date watchers
[2:07:30] june
[2:07:32] june
[2:07:35] of 63
[2:07:37] seals are preached
[2:07:39] bible's a new book
[2:07:41] right right
[2:07:43] and here's still what he's telling us
[2:07:46] he said he never changes his ways god
[2:07:48] don't never change his program he just
[2:07:51] does the same thing all the time
[2:07:53] the way he lays down his program it must
[2:07:56] toe to that
[2:07:58] each time
[2:07:59] it's got to be the same thing
[2:08:02] and if you will do the same thing the
[2:08:04] same results
[2:08:07] will come
[2:08:08] amen
[2:08:10] that's right
[2:08:11] does anybody believe that
[2:08:14] can i give you some more
[2:08:16] i know you didn't just come for reading
[2:08:22] queen of sheba but you need it
[2:08:25] because i got something to share in a
[2:08:26] minute
[2:08:27] verse seven paragraph seven the reading
[2:08:29] of the scriptures tonight
[2:08:31] we've just read a portion of the
[2:08:32] infallible word of the eternal god
[2:08:35] and jesus had just been upbraiding them
[2:08:37] because their hardness of their heart
[2:08:39] because they had not believed him
[2:08:42] then we find that he back in the former
[2:08:44] part of the scriptures that it in the
[2:08:46] same text or chapter they had called him
[2:08:48] beelzebub because he was doing the
[2:08:50] supernatural signs
[2:08:52] and if anyone knew that god listen if
[2:08:54] anyone knew that god always dwells
[2:08:58] in supernatural
[2:09:00] you know where god dwells
[2:09:02] he always dwells in supernatural
[2:09:06] if it's natural he may not be dwelling
[2:09:08] there but if it's supernatural
[2:09:12] he said in his children
[2:09:13] which are his offspring
[2:09:17] not grandchildren
[2:09:19] we're talking about word born children
[2:09:21] now aren't we
[2:09:22] he said because god himself is
[2:09:24] supernatural and his children which are
[2:09:26] his offspring is the nature of their
[2:09:29] father
[2:09:34] see the language
[2:09:35] nature of their father meaning that
[2:09:37] jesus
[2:09:40] nature of their father you
[2:09:42] same way nature the soul being the
[2:09:44] nature of the spirit do you see the
[2:09:46] language
[2:09:47] he said they also believe in the
[2:09:49] supernatural
[2:09:50] so if they cannot believe in the
[2:09:53] supernatural then the spirit of god is
[2:09:56] not in them
[2:09:59] dominating their life
[2:10:01] is there anybody in here that wants to
[2:10:03] be dominated
[2:10:05] by the spirit of god oh i want to be
[2:10:07] dominated by the spirit of god is there
[2:10:09] more to that one
[2:10:11] he said these great cultured men those
[2:10:13] days the priests and the rabbis and the
[2:10:16] pharisees which were very highly
[2:10:18] cultured men fine educated scholars know
[2:10:20] the word just the letter and they had to
[2:10:22] live unspotted lives because he that
[2:10:25] despised moses law died under two or
[2:10:29] three witnesses and they would be stoned
[2:10:34] if they did anything wrong so they must
[2:10:36] be a select group a scholarly group an
[2:10:39] educated group
[2:10:42] [Music]
[2:10:43] but god doesn't dwell in any of that
[2:10:46] where does he dwell he lives in the
[2:10:47] supernatural he dwells in humility in an
[2:10:50] honest heart anybody
[2:10:53] such as we'll receive him
[2:10:56] these men didn't have that
[2:10:59] they were puffed up in themselves
[2:11:02] oh
[2:11:03] are you there
[2:11:05] i
[2:11:06] i got to get somewhere

[2:12:46] going to read it all cause you'd sleep
[2:12:48] and you'd miss it some of you
[2:12:51] but i wanna read some excerpts is that
[2:12:52] all right good
[2:12:54] look what it says out there in big bold
[2:12:55] letters god has no grandsons
[2:12:59] by david
[2:13:01] du plessis
[2:13:02] and it says there in the in the top
[2:13:06] no matter whether you are jew
[2:13:09] catholic protestant or pentecostal you
[2:13:12] must be born again or you are not in the
[2:13:14] family because god has no grandsons
[2:13:20] you better hear me message people
[2:13:24] it was early morning around four o'clock
[2:13:27] in the month of january there was snow
[2:13:29] everywhere outside
[2:13:31] the radio news had predicted 10 degrees
[2:13:34] below zero temperatures that night
[2:13:37] i was awakened from a deep restful sleep
[2:13:39] give me just a little more in the house
[2:13:42] i was uh
[2:13:44] awakened from a deep restful sleep by a
[2:13:47] voice
[2:13:48] that seemed loud and clear
[2:13:51] i sat up in my bed and looked around the
[2:13:53] room
[2:13:54] the street light was shining through one
[2:13:56] window i saw no one in the room all was
[2:13:59] quiet yet that voice kept ringing in my
[2:14:03] ear it seemed i could still hear it
[2:14:06] distinctly saying
[2:14:08] god
[2:14:09] has no
[2:14:11] grand
[2:14:12] sons
[2:14:14] i stamped the light on and took my bible
[2:14:17] is there a text about grandsons
[2:14:19] i could i could remember none
[2:14:22] how about sons
[2:14:24] i turned on the gospel of john chapter 1
[2:14:28] verse 12 and 13. i have all those verses
[2:14:30] up there if you want to put any of them
[2:14:32] up for the people to see you can but as
[2:14:34] many as received him to them gave he the
[2:14:37] power to become the sons of god even to
[2:14:40] them that believe on his name so here's
[2:14:42] a scripture about sons
[2:14:44] which were born not of the blood nor of
[2:14:47] the will of the flesh
[2:14:48] nor of the will of man
[2:14:51] but of god sons of god born sons of god
[2:14:55] he said i checked further scriptures
[2:14:57] romans 8 14
[2:14:59] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[2:15:01] god they are the
[2:15:04] no grandsons they're sons of god
[2:15:07] he goes on first john 3 12 3 1-2 behold
[2:15:11] what manner of love the father hath
[2:15:13] bestowed on us that we should be called
[2:15:15] the sons of god
[2:15:18] he goes on beloved now are we the sons
[2:15:20] of god galatians 4 4 and 7 god sent
[2:15:23] forth his son to redeem and he goes on
[2:15:27] he said but i could find nothing about
[2:15:28] grandsons
[2:15:31] then i began to check whether there was
[2:15:32] any text that might signify that god
[2:15:35] could be a grandfather
[2:15:38] but i could find nothing in the old or
[2:15:40] the new testament so i concluded god is
[2:15:43] nobody's grandfather
[2:15:45] it was about five in the morning now i
[2:15:47] switched off the light and put on my
[2:15:49] thinking cap
[2:15:50] what have i discovered nothing new i
[2:15:52] always knew god our father in heaven
[2:15:54] he's the father of all believers
[2:15:56] believers in christ are called sons of
[2:15:58] god i have only found a new way of
[2:16:00] saying an old truth
[2:16:02] god is nobody's grandfather
[2:16:05] only father
[2:16:06] at breakfast that morning i discussed
[2:16:08] this experience with the pastor and his
[2:16:10] wife the voice and the thoughts seem to
[2:16:13] stay with me all the time this lasted
[2:16:15] for all the ten days that i continued to
[2:16:17] minister in minneapolis minnesota i
[2:16:19] received no revelation or inspiration
[2:16:22] those whom i talked to thought it was
[2:16:23] very popular way of saying that only
[2:16:25] those that are born of god are sons of
[2:16:27] god beyond that there is no relationship
[2:16:29] god has no grandsons he is no
[2:16:32] grandfather
[2:16:34] i had to fly to chicago and by phone
[2:16:36] made reservations for an evening flight
[2:16:38] i never checked just how that flight
[2:16:40] would go after we were airborne i
[2:16:42] discovered we had to change planes in
[2:16:43] milwaukee i was so little i was no
[2:16:46] little displeased because it was another
[2:16:48] bitter cold night with below zero
[2:16:49] temperatures then the still small voice
[2:16:52] whispered
[2:16:53] maybe you should meet someone on this
[2:16:55] trip to speak to that settled it i shall
[2:16:57] be watching and seeking to find that
[2:16:59] someone i looked over the passengers in
[2:17:01] the plane no guidance then after landing
[2:17:03] i looked over the people in the terminal
[2:17:05] of milwaukee no one spoke to me
[2:17:07] i saw none i felt led to go speak to
[2:17:09] then came the call for the flight to
[2:17:10] chicago when i came to the gate i felt
[2:17:13] terribly lonely and very homesick then i
[2:17:15] heard voices i saw five men in black
[2:17:18] come toward me they began to shake hands
[2:17:20] with each other and only one came on
[2:17:22] toward the gate the others weighed
[2:17:23] farewell so it seems we were the two
[2:17:25] passengers for the flight
[2:17:28] this may be the person that i have to
[2:17:30] talk to there is no one else so why not
[2:17:33] get acquainted are you a passenger due
[2:17:35] to chicago i ask yes sir are we the only
[2:17:37] two passengers said my friend
[2:17:40] there is the last call it seems we must
[2:17:42] be the only two passengers are you a
[2:17:44] roman catholic priest sir i question yes
[2:17:46] i am a priest
[2:17:48] with an educational appointment came his
[2:17:50] reply as we walked on the plane then he
[2:17:52] asked and you what are you
[2:17:54] oh i am also a priest
[2:17:57] i said but what kind of priest are you
[2:17:58] queried my companion he said sir i'm a
[2:18:00] pentecostal priest
[2:18:03] you mean you belong to the movement that
[2:18:05] is growing so fast around the world yes
[2:18:08] sir that is what is generally admitted
[2:18:10] these days could you tell me all about
[2:18:13] them do you know much about the
[2:18:14] pentecostal movement i told them that i
[2:18:16] had been in the movement since 1918 and
[2:18:18] that i had served as secretary for
[2:18:20] several world conferences of the
[2:18:22] pentecostal movement oh how fortunate i
[2:18:24] am to meet you he exclaimed as we
[2:18:26] boarded the plane i want to know all
[2:18:27] about you pentecostals
[2:18:29] as we took two seats side by side the
[2:18:31] steward has offered her services my
[2:18:33] friend said to her lady we need nothing
[2:18:36] we only want to talk
[2:18:38] so you may go to the front seat and
[2:18:40] crawl up there and go to sleep for all
[2:18:42] we care
[2:18:45] when he said this the holy spirit spoke
[2:18:47] to me and said to tell him god has no
[2:18:50] grandsons
[2:18:52] then i knew that now i would receive
[2:18:54] further revelation on the word that i
[2:18:56] had heard the morning i began to witness
[2:18:58] about my conversion when i was born
[2:19:00] again or born of god i continue to
[2:19:02] relate how after my conversion in 1916 i
[2:19:05] received the holy spirit in 1918 and how
[2:19:07] i had been called into the ministry i
[2:19:09] kept quoting new testament parallels
[2:19:11] first saying christ was born of the
[2:19:13] spirit which we call the virgin birth
[2:19:15] then at the age of 30 at jordan he
[2:19:17] received the holy spirit two distinct
[2:19:18] happenings first birth then endurement
[2:19:21] for service christ never ministered
[2:19:23] until he had received the holy spirit
[2:19:28] so christ commanded his disciples not to
[2:19:30] leave the city of jerusalem until they
[2:19:32] had repented receive the holy ghost on
[2:19:33] the day of and he goes on
[2:19:36] he's just preaching away to him
[2:19:40] again two experiences
[2:19:43] suddenly my friend interrupted with oh i
[2:19:45] see what you are trying to do
[2:19:47] you are trying to revive the apostolic
[2:19:50] church of the new testament in this
[2:19:53] century and you expect the same things
[2:19:56] to happen now that were experienced by
[2:19:58] the early churches
[2:20:01] he said no sir
[2:20:03] i replied
[2:20:05] we are trying nothing of the kind
[2:20:09] we are only standing back and watching
[2:20:12] it happen
[2:20:13] all over
[2:20:16] the world
[2:20:18] let's think about such a thing as that
[2:20:20] whoo
[2:20:22] he said
[2:20:28] he said the first church was a creation
[2:20:30] of the holy spirit and he has not
[2:20:32] changed but in every generation he wants
[2:20:36] to repeat what he had done in the first
[2:20:39] christian church through the first
[2:20:41] leaders and members
[2:20:45] i know it's not brother branham but
[2:20:46] brother branham quoted this man
[2:20:49] he said then i proceeded to tell him how
[2:20:51] in miracle fashion in many countries
[2:20:53] almost simultaneously at the turn of the
[2:20:55] century the holy spirit moved upon those
[2:20:58] who were praying for revival it happened
[2:21:00] in the united states in europe in asia
[2:21:02] in africa on every continent in almost
[2:21:04] every country of the world the
[2:21:05] pentecostal revival became known as the
[2:21:08] pentecostal movement which now has
[2:21:10] somewhere around 10 million adherents
[2:21:13] he said i have no time and space to give
[2:21:14] all the details finally he interrupted
[2:21:17] and said i take it that you think all
[2:21:19] other christian churches are wrong or
[2:21:20] that they've gone wrong
[2:21:22] i prayed for guidance to answer that
[2:21:24] question in a flash i got it i said yes
[2:21:26] sir they've all gone wrong
[2:21:28] and even now the pentecostals
[2:21:31] are falling into the same ditch
[2:21:35] this is mr pentecost
[2:21:38] known all over the world mr pentecost
[2:21:40] and he's indicting his own group
[2:21:43] so don't you get your little self worked
[2:21:45] up in a few minutes
[2:21:48] when you hear me indicting my own group
[2:21:52] because here we are another generation
[2:21:54] and we're doing the same thing
[2:21:56] falling in the ditch
[2:21:59] [Music]
[2:22:03] he goes on
[2:22:09] yes sir they even now the pentecost is
[2:22:11] falling in the same ditch and they are
[2:22:12] going wrong too he looks shocked
[2:22:15] but what do they do when why where how
[2:22:18] do they all go wrong now sir i said your
[2:22:20] church claims to be the oldest church
[2:22:22] not so yes there's where your righty
[2:22:24] answered then your church went wrong
[2:22:26] first
[2:22:28] talk about the catholic church then your
[2:22:29] church went wrong first
[2:22:31] isn't that good
[2:22:32] he said and after that all fell into the
[2:22:34] same ditch i added they all do the same
[2:22:37] thing they begin right
[2:22:39] and keep right
[2:22:41] for a long time and then they go off the
[2:22:43] highway of god into the byways of men
[2:22:48] you let the old-timers die
[2:22:52] come on now you let the old gifted let
[2:22:54] me tell you something this message is
[2:22:55] facing a crisis you don't have to say a
[2:22:58] mineral me
[2:22:59] we that have come out of pentecost to
[2:23:01] believe this truth are dying
[2:23:04] we're physically dying
[2:23:07] i can now call myself an elder
[2:23:09] i've been around long enough we're dying
[2:23:12] those men who believe this message but
[2:23:14] still believe in the gifts many of them
[2:23:16] are dying
[2:23:18] and if god doesn't raise up another
[2:23:20] generation
[2:23:24] and that's what he's trying to do
[2:23:26] but it's not just a youth meeting that's
[2:23:28] going to do it it's not just a youth
[2:23:29] camp that's going to do it it's total
[2:23:31] deliverance that's going to be required
[2:23:34] you can't bring young people to a
[2:23:36] weekend
[2:23:37] let them jump and dance and holler and
[2:23:39] talk in tongues and have a good time
[2:23:40] roll around and send them back to their
[2:23:43] dead churches
[2:23:47] where that's never going to be
[2:23:48] cultivated or encouraged in them again
[2:23:51] have them go to the same pornography
[2:23:53] sites that we're going to to start with
[2:23:58] and expect there to be leadership for
[2:23:59] this next generation of believers
[2:24:02] it's going to require something more
[2:24:05] than that
[2:24:07] we're going to have to get every person
[2:24:09] to their own personal birth
[2:24:12] every individual
[2:24:15] [Applause]
[2:24:19] you don't have any grandchildren
[2:24:22] he doesn't have any grandchildren
[2:24:25] this is not to condemn anybody here it's
[2:24:27] not to condemn anybody out there it's
[2:24:30] just to say sometimes we go back we look
[2:24:32] at history and we say god have mercy let
[2:24:35] us not be so stupid
[2:24:38] to do the same thing again
[2:24:43] you know the churches are so afraid of a
[2:24:45] little bit of wildfire
[2:24:46] they're afraid somebody's going to talk
[2:24:48] in tongues and nobody's going to
[2:24:50] interpret it so they shut it all down
[2:24:55] they're afraid somebody's going to fall
[2:24:56] while they're dancing so they shut it
[2:24:58] all down do what i've done snatch them
[2:25:00] up and tell them to keep on dancing
[2:25:04] you you can't live in fear of wildfire
[2:25:08] my old granny used to say they've cried
[2:25:11] wildfire wildfire until they put out the
[2:25:13] fire
[2:25:15] she said we can't find fire
[2:25:17] and she said i'll tell you what's in my
[2:25:19] soul if this is not the fire it'll do
[2:25:22] till the real fire gets here
[2:25:25] because it changed my life
[2:25:27] you can't live in paranoia of wildfire
[2:25:35] i'm i'm preparing for a dozen different
[2:25:38] messages at one time i spent several
[2:25:40] hours yesterday in the gifts
[2:25:42] and
[2:25:45] i am so shocked at how many times
[2:25:47] brother branham tells this same story
[2:25:49] about meeting a leader who said to him
[2:25:52] if you all are so
[2:25:54] pentecostal or whatever so spiritual and
[2:25:56] your prophet no why don't you teach them
[2:25:58] women how to operate in the gifts
[2:26:01] you hear that story he told it over and
[2:26:04] over and over and over again
[2:26:06] and and he said because that's not what
[2:26:08] we're trying to do we're not trying to
[2:26:10] teach anybody how to operate in the
[2:26:12] gifts
[2:26:14] and i hear them say that quote
[2:26:16] i hear the preachers quote it i hear
[2:26:18] well-meaning sweet people we're not
[2:26:20] trying to encourage people that's not
[2:26:21] what he said
[2:26:23] he said we're not trying to teach them
[2:26:25] how
[2:26:26] [Music]
[2:26:28] but through the years the quotes changed
[2:26:29] a little bit i read them i found them
[2:26:32] dozens he said why don't you teach them
[2:26:35] how he said that's not what we're trying
[2:26:37] to do
[2:26:38] we're not trying to teach them how to
[2:26:40] operate in the gifts of the spirit
[2:26:43] that's a whole lot different than saying
[2:26:44] we're not encouraging them
[2:26:48] brother branham actually said this is a
[2:26:50] safe place for those things to take
[2:26:52] place anybody with me
[2:26:54] all right i gotta i gotta get back to
[2:26:55] this
[2:26:57] oh i got a little emotional there
[2:27:01] all right he goes on let me let me find
[2:27:03] my place and i'm skipping a whole lot
[2:27:04] too but but he said uh
[2:27:07] they all do the same thing they begin
[2:27:08] right and keep right for a long time and
[2:27:10] then fall off into the byways
[2:27:13] god has no grandsons
[2:27:16] my friend was
[2:27:18] he said i
[2:27:19] what did they do he said i've got to
[2:27:21] know that before we get off at chicago
[2:27:23] i've got to i've got to i've got to know
[2:27:24] that
[2:27:26] and he said
[2:27:28] with a deep prayer in my heart i said to
[2:27:30] him in a slow clear word
[2:27:32] they give god grandsons
[2:27:36] and god has no grandsons he was asking
[2:27:38] what do these churches do to get off how
[2:27:40] do they get in the ditch
[2:27:42] and here was his answer
[2:27:47] he said actually i
[2:27:49] never heard of such a thing until a few
[2:27:51] weeks ago he's explaining this to the
[2:27:53] priest when i heard an audible voice say
[2:27:55] to me god has no grandsons and only now
[2:27:57] the this very moment have i learned what
[2:27:59] the words mean now i'll try to explain
[2:28:02] why where when and how all this happens
[2:28:06] now i don't want to go through every one
[2:28:08] of these scriptures because he is
[2:28:11] he is really quoting scripture
[2:28:14] but he said thus it was clear that every
[2:28:16] jew and every gentile that came into the
[2:28:18] christian church did so by repentance or
[2:28:21] conversion or being born of the spirit
[2:28:24] everyone had a very definite encounter
[2:28:27] with the living christ the resurrected
[2:28:29] son of god
[2:28:31] he said this revival continued and the
[2:28:33] church grew and christianity swept the
[2:28:36] world at that time
[2:28:38] then some jews or some gentile began to
[2:28:40] reason
[2:28:43] i was a jew or a gentile and became a
[2:28:45] christian by repentance for sin and
[2:28:48] conversion from judaism or paganism and
[2:28:51] so was my wife but this boy of mine
[2:28:56] has never been a jew
[2:28:59] or has never been a gentile
[2:29:02] he did not grow up in the temple
[2:29:04] he was born from christian parents in a
[2:29:06] christian home
[2:29:08] and was brought up in the christian
[2:29:10] church
[2:29:11] he is born christian
[2:29:14] do you see how this reasoning
[2:29:17] i think david duplessis was onto
[2:29:18] something
[2:29:20] when we go to israel they introduce us
[2:29:23] to
[2:29:24] arab christians
[2:29:26] they call them arab christians to make
[2:29:29] sure that you understand that they are
[2:29:31] not muslim arabs
[2:29:34] when you start investigating you find
[2:29:37] out that most of them do not even know
[2:29:40] that it is possible to have a born-again
[2:29:43] experience with jesus christ
[2:29:45] i i witness to a man in bethlehem of all
[2:29:48] places for over an hour and a half
[2:29:51] telling him that he must be born again
[2:29:55] he said to me pastor why i was born a
[2:29:58] christian my mother was a christian my
[2:29:59] father was a christian i've never prayed
[2:30:01] to allah why would i need an experience
[2:30:04] with god to be a christian i was born a
[2:30:07] christian
[2:30:09] so i understand this kind of reasoning
[2:30:12] we have the same thing around this
[2:30:14] message today
[2:30:20] i was born a believer
[2:30:22] i was born a message believer my mama
[2:30:24] believed this message my daddy believed
[2:30:25] this message and i believe this message
[2:30:28] as though that's enough
[2:30:31] it's not enough
[2:30:33] every man has to have but let's go back
[2:30:35] to this
[2:30:36] let's go back to this because this is
[2:30:38] worth getting to
[2:30:42] now he said this may all be true but he
[2:30:44] has never been born of the spirit that
[2:30:46] child is not repented as a sinner
[2:30:48] because he had a strict training as the
[2:30:50] son of a christian parent he was taught
[2:30:52] to try and live like a christian
[2:30:54] for he is the son of god's children
[2:30:57] the nicest thing you could say about him
[2:31:00] is that being the son of two of god's
[2:31:02] children who became a son and a daughter
[2:31:04] of god by regeneration he is now a
[2:31:07] grandson of god
[2:31:11] but he said there it is
[2:31:13] god has no grandsons
[2:31:16] you cannot call that boy a christian
[2:31:18] because his parents were christians
[2:31:22] what is he nothing
[2:31:26] not catholic not protestant not
[2:31:28] christian
[2:31:29] not pentecostal not message believer
[2:31:31] he's nothing right until he has his own
[2:31:34] pentecostal experience
[2:31:36] by definition the only thing duplicitous
[2:31:38] said the only thing we could say nice
[2:31:40] about him is that he was a grandson
[2:31:43] but god has no grandsons are you awake
[2:31:46] now i want you to listen to this
[2:31:49] gradually the early christians began to
[2:31:52] accept as members
[2:31:55] into their churches they're well-trained
[2:31:58] but unregenerated children
[2:32:04] until the pews were packed with members
[2:32:07] that had had no encounter with christ as
[2:32:10] savior and much less a pentecostal
[2:32:13] experience
[2:32:15] full churches
[2:32:17] no births
[2:32:19] they were not born of the spirit and
[2:32:20] therefore could not be filled with the
[2:32:22] spirit god says it is not by power not
[2:32:24] by might but by my spirit the spirit
[2:32:28] found no more blood cleansed hearts in
[2:32:30] the church to dwell in and the church
[2:32:32] cooled off spiritually until even in the
[2:32:35] pulpit there stood unregenerate but
[2:32:38] well-trained preachers
[2:32:42] that spoke the letter
[2:32:45] but had not the spirit
[2:32:49] men who chose preaching and pastoring as
[2:32:52] a vocation
[2:32:54] as a as a job as a career like someone
[2:32:58] would choose to be a lawyer how many of
[2:33:00] you know the pulpit it's not for a man
[2:33:02] that chooses to be there because he
[2:33:05] needs a job
[2:33:07] brother branham said it's not a meal
[2:33:09] ticket
[2:33:10] it's a calling
[2:33:22] he said when emperor constantine cost
[2:33:25] his army forced his army
[2:33:27] to be baptized into the church
[2:33:30] it was already so dead
[2:33:33] with a whole generation of unregenerated
[2:33:36] grandsons
[2:33:38] that these sinful soldiers felt at home
[2:33:40] in christian society
[2:33:42] spiritually the church was dead this is
[2:33:44] his story history historical
[2:33:47] spiritually the church was dead but god
[2:33:49] did not leave it at that time and again
[2:33:51] the holy spirit found a heart through
[2:33:53] whom he could reach the ears of the
[2:33:54] people such men were the exception and
[2:33:57] were looked upon as fanatics
[2:33:59] and were often persecuted or martyred
[2:34:02] we're talking about church history
[2:34:04] here comes a man saying you've got to
[2:34:06] have a birth you've got to have an
[2:34:08] experience you've got to know god for
[2:34:10] yourself and he was either persecuted or
[2:34:12] martyred
[2:34:13] he said there came for instance martin
[2:34:15] luther
[2:34:16] out of his ministry came the reformation
[2:34:19] there seemed to come into life a new
[2:34:21] church with members that had a fresh and
[2:34:22] very real encounter with christ and with
[2:34:24] the real holy spirit however it was not
[2:34:27] long before some lutheran parents began
[2:34:29] to reason and say but our children have
[2:34:31] never been roman catholics
[2:34:34] they were born lutherans
[2:34:36] right there it began again grandsons for
[2:34:38] god in the lutheran and reformation
[2:34:41] churches
[2:34:43] it's a repeat isn't it
[2:34:44] then came john wesley in england and we
[2:34:47] had the wesleyan revival again men and
[2:34:49] women were challenged to seek god and be
[2:34:51] born of the spirit but after two or
[2:34:53] three generations some parents began to
[2:34:55] reason our children have never been
[2:34:57] anglicans or lutherans or roman
[2:34:59] catholics they're born wesleyans or
[2:35:01] methodists
[2:35:03] they were born wesleyans are methodists
[2:35:04] soon the grandsons filled the church
[2:35:06] again
[2:35:09] and revival was over if you don't think
[2:35:12] this matters
[2:35:15] he said now at the turn of the century
[2:35:17] came this pentecostal revival
[2:35:19] all were called to repentance everyone
[2:35:21] born of the spirit was now encouraged to
[2:35:23] seek and receive the baptism in the
[2:35:25] spirit with the new testament evidence
[2:35:27] of speaking in tongues and with the
[2:35:28] manifestation to the holy spirit such as
[2:35:30] prophecy and healing
[2:35:32] no matter how the older churches
[2:35:34] objected the revival spread it was the
[2:35:36] same in the catholic countries as in
[2:35:38] protestant countries and even in pagan
[2:35:40] islands when people are born of the
[2:35:42] spirit they live when such people are
[2:35:44] filled with a spirit they receive power
[2:35:47] to become witnesses
[2:35:49] he said but what has happened now
[2:35:51] we find that in the beginning of this
[2:35:53] revival pentecost 50 years ago
[2:35:56] everyone was expected to be filled with
[2:35:58] the spirit with the confirmation of
[2:36:01] tongues before they could hold any
[2:36:02] office in the pentecostal church or the
[2:36:04] pentecostal assembly but there are today
[2:36:08] the sons and grandsons
[2:36:11] of pentecostal pioneers who are teaching
[2:36:14] in sunday schools and holding all kinds
[2:36:16] of offices in the local churches
[2:36:18] without ever having a real baptism of
[2:36:21] the spirit according to acts 2 4.
[2:36:24] now some of you couldn't get past the
[2:36:26] speaking in tongues part
[2:36:31] you know you can't hear no more because
[2:36:33] he said the evidence of speaking in
[2:36:36] tongues
[2:36:37] don't let that throw you
[2:36:40] they're the ones that shoved it down
[2:36:41] everybody's throat a generation ago
[2:36:44] pentecost said if you speak in tongues
[2:36:45] you've got it all
[2:36:47] and now pentecostal churches are being
[2:36:50] led by people who have never had an
[2:36:52] experience with the holy ghost
[2:36:57] so even they've given up their dogmas
[2:37:01] it doesn't matter as long as you've got
[2:37:02] another generation to keep the church
[2:37:04] going
[2:37:05] there's got to be more than that
[2:37:08] he said the waves of pentecost
[2:37:10] a power and revival are receding fast
[2:37:13] what year was this
[2:37:18] 60
[2:37:22] 60
[2:37:24] 1960.
[2:37:29] we find that in the beginning of this
[2:37:37] there's danger
[2:37:39] that in another generation we may have a
[2:37:41] pentecostal movement
[2:37:43] without pentecost
[2:37:47] we do that's what we have today in the
[2:37:48] world it's a church world today it's a
[2:37:50] seeker sensitive a seeker friendly group
[2:37:52] of people that they're more interested
[2:37:55] in entertaining people with smoke
[2:37:56] machines and coffee shops and
[2:38:00] and call themselves pentecostal they're
[2:38:02] named after their mother
[2:38:06] the name on the sign out there named
[2:38:07] after their mother that's a problem
[2:38:09] they're illegitimate born children
[2:38:10] blasphemous names
[2:38:12] they're supposed to be bearing the name
[2:38:13] of their father
[2:38:15] you can't bear the name of your father
[2:38:16] unless you've had a birth
[2:38:18] if you're carrying the name of your
[2:38:19] mother you're carrying the name of their
[2:38:21] own church
[2:38:24] you're not born of a woman
[2:38:26] you're not born of a church you're born
[2:38:28] of a christ
[2:38:30] you're born of a father
[2:38:32] see
[2:38:34] he said we're going to have a
[2:38:35] pentecostal movement without pentecost
[2:38:36] that is without the experience but still
[2:38:39] holding the letter
[2:38:41] holding the doctrine just like other
[2:38:42] revivals but emphasize some other truth
[2:38:44] but never experience it
[2:38:48] revivals crystallize into societies and
[2:38:51] establish churches when the grandsons
[2:38:53] take over
[2:38:58] but god has no grandsons
[2:39:01] shocking shocking
[2:39:04] was all my friend the priest could say
[2:39:08] then he said we should meet again
[2:39:11] your grandfather's story has upset my
[2:39:13] philosophy
[2:39:15] we parted with a warm handshake
[2:39:20] i prayed for him i wonder what he
[2:39:22] pondered that evening what am i a son or
[2:39:24] a grandson
[2:39:26] then the next morning when he prayed did
[2:39:28] he remember our father who art in heaven
[2:39:30] have i treated him like a grandfather
[2:39:32] but god is no one's grandfather
[2:39:35] and he goes on to say i have repeated
[2:39:36] that story wherever i get an opportunity
[2:39:39] to preach whether it's roman catholic
[2:39:40] church or protestant churches or ranks
[2:39:41] of my own pentecostal brethren remember
[2:39:43] god has no grandsons how many of you see
[2:39:47] how many of you see the point
[2:39:50] god has no grandsons i want to tell you
[2:39:52] that's why when i saw joshua responding
[2:39:54] to the holy spirit i wanted to rush over
[2:39:57] and encourage that because god has no
[2:40:01] grandsons
[2:40:12] just a little more it's not it's not
[2:40:14] quite
[2:40:15] too
[2:40:20] yuma arizona the rapture paragraph 99
[2:40:23] jesus wants fruit for himself
[2:40:26] his wife must produce the kind of
[2:40:28] children that he is
[2:40:31] so if it does not produce children
[2:40:34] bride children children of the word then
[2:40:38] it is denominational child
[2:40:43] do you understand that if we are
[2:40:45] producing denominational children we're
[2:40:47] trying to give god grandsons
[2:40:50] and he's not looking for grandsons he's
[2:40:52] looking for sons
[2:40:54] he said so her first love is for the
[2:40:57] world and the denomination
[2:41:00] and she will have returned to that and
[2:41:02] it cannot produce a true genuine born
[2:41:04] again christian because there is nothing
[2:41:06] there
[2:41:09] to produce it
[2:41:12] in a conference with god 1960.
[2:41:16] brother branham said a lot of people
[2:41:17] that's half born
[2:41:20] part of the way born grandsons
[2:41:23] as david duplessis said the other night
[2:41:25] god don't have grandchildren he only has
[2:41:28] sons and daughters but when it comes to
[2:41:30] a place that a grandchild that's just
[2:41:32] brought in by because his mother was
[2:41:35] pentecostal or his daddy was pentecostal
[2:41:38] he become part of the church no sir
[2:41:40] he's got to be born just like his daddy
[2:41:43] was cause god doesn't have grandchildren
[2:41:48] he's got to have the experience
[2:41:52] he can't go in on papa's experience or
[2:41:55] mama's experience you've got to have
[2:41:57] your own experience
[2:41:59] that was their birth
[2:42:01] you know you have to have a birth too
[2:42:04] god don't recognize grandchildren
[2:42:08] he doesn't have any i forgot i'm yelling
[2:42:11] and i told him to turn it up out there
[2:42:13] they're all sons and daughters who say
[2:42:15] well i was born my mother and father was
[2:42:17] methodist and i was took into the
[2:42:19] methodist church that's all right
[2:42:21] but you're a grandchild
[2:42:23] until you're born
[2:42:25] of the spirit of god if my children were
[2:42:27] here i'll tell you what i want them to
[2:42:29] listen to this
[2:42:31] i might give them a shake on the elbow
[2:42:34] i'd want them to hear this right here
[2:42:37] he said that's all right but you're a
[2:42:39] grandchild until you're born of the
[2:42:40] spirit of god then you're not a
[2:42:42] grandchild
[2:42:44] now god remembered his promise and he
[2:42:46] sent moses and it goes on i'm not going
[2:42:48] to read the rest of that now
[2:42:51] because there's so much more here that
[2:42:53] we could get to but i don't want to do
[2:42:54] that
[2:42:55] i want to talk to you personally for
[2:42:57] just a moment or two
[2:42:59] and i want to explain to you where i'm
[2:43:01] coming from
[2:43:04] the changes that i have seen already
[2:43:06] around the message churches
[2:43:09] since i heard the message in the late
[2:43:11] 80s
[2:43:12] is absolutely astonishing
[2:43:18] you used to have special meetings and
[2:43:20] the pastors would support one another
[2:43:24] and now there is such a jealousy among
[2:43:26] some of us i'm going to say some of us
[2:43:29] there's so such a jealousy among some of
[2:43:31] us that we're so afraid that if our
[2:43:34] people go over to another meeting and
[2:43:36] support they're never coming back
[2:43:42] and we let jealousy eat us alive
[2:43:45] this kind of attitude in the ministry it
[2:43:48] brings in grandchildren but no sons are
[2:43:51] born
[2:43:53] because we need exposure to all the
[2:43:55] five-fold ministry
[2:44:00] i'm never afraid this is going to sound
[2:44:02] arrogant but i don't mean it that way at
[2:44:04] all i'm never afraid
[2:44:08] i'm never afraid
[2:44:11] because i know that people can't live on
[2:44:13] the message of an evangelist
[2:44:18] i've sat over there and had evangelists
[2:44:21] through here and see the church turn
[2:44:23] upside down shouting amen praise god
[2:44:27] never heard that i get text on my phone
[2:44:29] brother shelly i've never heard that
[2:44:31] never heard such preaching never heard
[2:44:33] those kind of things before and i just
[2:44:34] laugh inside and i say you've been
[2:44:36] hearing the very same things same text
[2:44:38] same quotes for 20 years
[2:44:40] [Music]
[2:44:42] but sitting there making sure that i
[2:44:44] don't let jealousy take a hold of my
[2:44:46] heart because that is the work of an
[2:44:49] evangelist to come in and stir up
[2:44:52] people's hearts
[2:44:55] [Applause]
[2:44:56] but there are very few evangelists that
[2:44:59] could pastor
[2:45:03] that's why you've got to know what your
[2:45:05] calling is
[2:45:08] there are very few evangelists and if he
[2:45:10] is if he does become a pastor he has to
[2:45:12] adjust his message a little bit
[2:45:15] because evangelism sunday after sunday
[2:45:17] after sunday after sunday doesn't bring
[2:45:19] the body any higher
[2:45:22] it's presenting the gospel to lost souls
[2:45:24] but it's not bringing the bride up into
[2:45:26] any kind of maturity
[2:45:28] so we need one another
[2:45:31] we need a five-fold ministry we need
[2:45:34] those who have organization callings and
[2:45:36] anointings
[2:45:38] we need those who have prophetic calling
[2:45:40] and anointings we need pastors who can
[2:45:43] pull people together evangelists that
[2:45:45] can preach soul-stirring messages
[2:45:48] we need teachers who can bring the word
[2:45:50] break it down and teach it to us in a
[2:45:53] way that we can receive it it is not a
[2:45:55] competition
[2:45:57] it's not supposed to be preachers
[2:45:59] against preachers
[2:46:01] we're supposed to be doing this thing
[2:46:03] together
[2:46:06] i have watched when i was hearing this
[2:46:08] truth
[2:46:09] the people the preachers were
[2:46:11] emphasizing over and over again we've
[2:46:13] got to get people to the holy ghost
[2:46:14] listen in the 80s and early 90s
[2:46:17] the pastors were crying out you've got
[2:46:19] to have the holy ghost you've got to
[2:46:20] have the holy ghost you've got to have
[2:46:22] the holy ghost you've got to have the
[2:46:23] holy ghost
[2:46:25] you've got to be plugged into a local
[2:46:26] church
[2:46:28] i remember the first youth camp i ever
[2:46:30] preached around this message
[2:46:32] i asked a young man who his pastor was
[2:46:34] and he said william
[2:46:36] branham i said well that sounds nice
[2:46:43] but you're going to have a hard time
[2:46:44] getting him to visit you in the hospital
[2:46:50] he's been dead since 1965.
[2:46:54] come on
[2:46:55] i don't know who's going to dedicate
[2:46:57] your baby
[2:46:58] or they found a way around it now they
[2:47:00] play a tape
[2:47:02] they do
[2:47:03] they bring their babies and play brother
[2:47:04] ram doing the tape so that they can call
[2:47:05] him their pastor i want you to know
[2:47:07] that's not what he preached
[2:47:10] he said we need these offices
[2:47:13] we need these five offices
[2:47:15] he taught us we need those gifts of the
[2:47:17] spirit it seems to me like people are
[2:47:19] afraid to have the gifts operating
[2:47:20] because they're afraid it's going to
[2:47:22] turn into wildfire or they're afraid
[2:47:24] they're going to have to hurt somebody's
[2:47:25] feelings when they call them to
[2:47:26] attention and say wait a minute that's
[2:47:28] not the way we demonstrate that that's
[2:47:30] not the way we operate that but isn't
[2:47:32] that the job of the leadership isn't
[2:47:34] that what we preachers are supposed to
[2:47:35] do isn't that part of what a pastor is
[2:47:38] is to shepherd this thing
[2:47:40] through growing pains
[2:47:43] turn this down just a little bit
[2:47:46] i'm wis i'm talking softer turn this
[2:47:48] down a little bit please there brother
[2:47:51] i'm talking softer no one's up there
[2:47:54] and somebody go up there luke is levi's
[2:47:56] doing something else
[2:48:00] i'm talking soft because i i i don't
[2:48:03] scream but i want to scream
[2:48:05] so just turn it down just a tad
[2:48:08] praise the lord
[2:48:10] better
[2:48:12] we've got to have our own experience
[2:48:14] with god now let me tell you some of the
[2:48:17] fruit of what i'm seeing
[2:48:19] as i look across
[2:48:20] social media and i look around and i see
[2:48:23] what's going on even in our ranks
[2:48:26] i see these competitions among the girls
[2:48:29] to see who can get the biggest
[2:48:31] engagement ring
[2:48:35] i see these pictures everybody's picture
[2:48:38] listen in my day if you had one you
[2:48:40] would never ever ever have flaunted it
[2:48:44] first of all holiness people didn't wear
[2:48:46] them
[2:48:47] and when i came around this message
[2:48:49] message people didn't wear them
[2:48:52] just being honest with you
[2:48:53] and now it's become such a thing that
[2:48:56] you can feel the com the competition and
[2:48:58] the competitive spirit because it's what
[2:49:00] you see pictured on on on social media
[2:49:03] they want to show that off something's
[2:49:05] wrong
[2:49:07] something's wrong
[2:49:09] now they want to show off their french
[2:49:11] tips their french manicures
[2:49:14] you see it it's all out there so
[2:49:16] everybody can see these things something
[2:49:18] is wrong
[2:49:20] the splits are getting higher the
[2:49:22] straight dresses are getting straighter
[2:49:25] the hair is getting wilder
[2:49:29] something's wrong
[2:49:31] and i'm telling you you don't have to
[2:49:32] help me
[2:49:34] you're not saying man
[2:49:36] i'm telling you i know what's wrong
[2:49:38] we're raising a generation of
[2:49:40] grandchildren
[2:49:42] that many of them never had their own
[2:49:44] pentecostal experience with god never
[2:49:48] ever had a real new birth
[2:49:50] and because of that the glitter and
[2:49:52] glamour of the world is still capturing
[2:49:55] them
[2:49:56] when i came around the message of the
[2:49:58] hour in the beginning
[2:50:00] we preached what brother branham
[2:50:02] preached he said that a man and a woman
[2:50:05] are not to kiss each other until they're
[2:50:06] married amen
[2:50:11] guess where he got such a crazy idea the
[2:50:13] bible
[2:50:14] paul said it's better for a man not to
[2:50:15] touch a woman
[2:50:17] amen
[2:50:18] it's simply because the pull of the
[2:50:21] flesh is real it's it's it's it's normal
[2:50:26] and it's real
[2:50:27] and so we should respect that
[2:50:30] brother branham called it sex glands in
[2:50:32] the lips
[2:50:34] i'm not sure that that is scientifically
[2:50:36] what you would call but i'm just saying
[2:50:38] amen
[2:50:39] because anybody that's ever kissed
[2:50:41] someone passionately
[2:50:42] [Music]
[2:50:44] knows what it does
[2:50:46] it sends a release of chemicals from
[2:50:48] your top of your head to your toes if
[2:50:50] she's purty
[2:50:52] and if she's not and not yours
[2:50:55] you ought not to be trying it out
[2:50:59] come on
[2:51:01] and so when they got married in the
[2:51:03] church they were supposed to be standing
[2:51:05] there pure before the lord
[2:51:09] having never touched one another
[2:51:12] is that right
[2:51:13] having never kissed one another
[2:51:15] so we preachers in those days we kind of
[2:51:18] agreed that it was a little bit
[2:51:20] classless
[2:51:22] it was a little bit crass
[2:51:24] to ask them
[2:51:26] to to share their first kiss
[2:51:29] in front of a congregation of people
[2:51:31] all gawking at them
[2:51:34] pastors
[2:51:35] we talked about it in meetings pastors
[2:51:38] meetings
[2:51:39] and we said why don't we just let them
[2:51:41] go out after they have been married and
[2:51:44] share their kiss and whatever else
[2:51:49] when they're married
[2:51:52] so that it doesn't become some kind of
[2:51:54] screaming out in church and
[2:51:57] making some catcalls and i've heard i've
[2:51:59] seen it all you don't have to say amen
[2:52:02] i'm not even asking for an amen now i'm
[2:52:05] just telling you how far we've come
[2:52:07] we've come a long long way
[2:52:09] and now it becomes a competition
[2:52:13] and now here's what's said when they see
[2:52:15] when the when the young people a lot of
[2:52:17] the young people around this message
[2:52:19] when they see a wedding like benjamin
[2:52:20] and genus where they didn't share a kiss
[2:52:23] the first thing they want to know is
[2:52:25] where was the kiss
[2:52:27] and you know what my answer was in
[2:52:29] private
[2:52:32] where it should have been
[2:52:35] because if they would have kissed
[2:52:37] awkwardly
[2:52:38] i'm just using them
[2:52:40] awkwardly somebody would have said
[2:52:42] some boy some boy some grandson
[2:52:45] some grandson in the church who's never
[2:52:48] had a born-again experience
[2:52:50] would have sat there and said i can tell
[2:52:51] that's his first kiss
[2:52:54] there used to have been a time that we
[2:52:56] would have celebrated that
[2:53:00] just a minute amen brother
[2:53:04] but instead we've raised a generation
[2:53:06] that mocks it
[2:53:08] and if they'd have kiss too good
[2:53:12] like some i've seen recently
[2:53:17] then people would have said they've had
[2:53:18] lots of practice
[2:53:22] there's something wrong when everything
[2:53:25] we do
[2:53:26] draws criticism
[2:53:29] from our own
[2:53:32] i know the pentecostals won't understand
[2:53:35] this i know the evangelicals won't
[2:53:37] understand us but something is wrong
[2:53:40] when we're drawing criticism from one
[2:53:42] another
[2:53:43] because we choose to do it like it was
[2:53:46] presented to us in the word
[2:53:49] and in the message
[2:53:52] now it's a competition
[2:53:54] who can have the biggest reception who
[2:53:56] can have the biggest this who can have
[2:53:57] the biggest that who can have the
[2:53:59] biggest ring who can make it the biggest
[2:54:01] this and on and on and on what you say
[2:54:04] what's that got to do with what you're
[2:54:05] preaching i realize that it's all the
[2:54:08] side effects
[2:54:10] of a generation of young people who many
[2:54:13] of them not all of them but many of them
[2:54:17] have never
[2:54:18] understood you've got to have your own
[2:54:22] encounter with the living god
[2:54:26] don't matter if you were born around the
[2:54:28] message
[2:54:31] god doesn't have any grandchildren the
[2:54:34] truth doesn't produce grandchildren
[2:54:37] it produces sons
[2:54:45] amen
[2:54:47] i want every young person
[2:54:49] in this assembly and those
[2:54:52] fellowshipping with this assembly i want
[2:54:54] you to know
[2:54:56] this is not to condemn you or anyone
[2:54:59] else it is to encourage you you've got
[2:55:03] to know
[2:55:05] you must know you can't ride your
[2:55:09] preacher's coattail
[2:55:13] you can't ride the old timer's coattail
[2:55:16] you've got to know
[2:55:18] a generation ago the young people didn't
[2:55:20] hold hands until they were married
[2:55:23] now it starts way before the engagement
[2:55:25] pictures
[2:55:29] and it goes all the way in
[2:55:31] i'm telling you something to me to me
[2:55:34] it's a it's a byproduct
[2:55:36] it is a side effect of what we have
[2:55:39] allowed to happen we have dumbed it down
[2:55:43] we have dumbed it down to make provision
[2:55:45] for people who are not willing to pay a
[2:55:47] price to have a birth
[2:55:51] somebody said well we don't we need more
[2:55:53] altar calls when you're called up here
[2:55:54] to worship god and you know you haven't
[2:55:57] had a birth nobody has to tell you
[2:56:00] nobody should have to tell you now if
[2:56:02] you know you don't have a birth you just
[2:56:04] walk over a little bit farther than the
[2:56:06] rest and kneel right down there nobody
[2:56:09] ought to have to tell you that's why
[2:56:10] it's here
[2:56:13] only you know somebody said i don't want
[2:56:15] anybody else to know it's better that
[2:56:17] everybody in the building know that
[2:56:19] you're not sure whether or not you have
[2:56:22] had a bear
[2:56:25] than to live another day
[2:56:28] not knowing whether or not you have been
[2:56:31] born again
[2:56:33] oh oh it goes on
[2:56:35] i know i use just some kind of frivolous
[2:56:38] uh
[2:56:38] side effects there there are so many
[2:56:42] there are so many
[2:56:44] when when uh
[2:56:46] when my boy started
[2:56:48] uh having interest in sports
[2:56:50] and i i so desperately would have liked
[2:56:53] to have kept that away from them because
[2:56:55] i understand that it is so hard to keep
[2:56:59] those things in balance
[2:57:05] it gets on you
[2:57:08] it do what amen
[2:57:10] it gets in you
[2:57:12] it gets on you
[2:57:14] it will consume you
[2:57:17] competition the spirit of competition
[2:57:20] will consume you
[2:57:24] every time you hear these boys out here
[2:57:26] saying we want a guy's game
[2:57:28] do you know what they're really saying
[2:57:36] we want to get in here and show each
[2:57:37] other just how good we really are
[2:57:40] we want the girls out of the way so they
[2:57:41] don't get hurt because we aim to compete
[2:57:45] with everything we've got
[2:57:48] it's a testosterone party
[2:57:52] in the church parking lot
[2:57:58] ain't that right paul chad
[2:58:04] i started to
[2:58:06] text you last night and congratulate you
[2:58:08] i was going to say congratulations
[2:58:09] you're going to say about what
[2:58:11] and i was going to say for being invited
[2:58:13] to play on the senior softball team i
[2:58:16] heard they invited you to play with the
[2:58:17] seniors
[2:58:20] [Music]
[2:58:22] i don't believe you can't have fun
[2:58:24] i don't believe you can't have
[2:58:26] entertainment i don't believe you can't
[2:58:28] have a volleyball game i don't believe
[2:58:31] that you can't have a nice wedding i
[2:58:33] don't believe that you can't enjoy being
[2:58:35] who you are and carry yourself with some
[2:58:37] distinction i don't believe any of that
[2:58:39] but what i believe is that everything
[2:58:41] must find a place of moderation and some
[2:58:44] things there's no room
[2:58:48] for moderation
[2:58:50] and you need to be away from it 100
[2:58:52] altogether and you've got to make sure
[2:58:54] that you've got a birth why are you even
[2:58:56] saying it this way because young people
[2:58:58] will join youth groups in churches
[2:59:01] and feel apart
[2:59:05] without having a birth
[2:59:09] pastors kids will be given positions in
[2:59:11] a church without having a birth
[2:59:16] amen deacon's kids
[2:59:19] without having a birth
[2:59:23] the problem with that is the next genera
[2:59:25] their kids come along
[2:59:30] they don't have a birth
[2:59:32] daddy didn't have a birth
[2:59:34] mama didn't have a birth
[2:59:37] watching a few few episodes on netflix
[2:59:39] has become cable
[2:59:45] now cable
[2:59:47] and it gets bigger and bigger and bigger
[2:59:51] and bigger
[2:59:53] amen brother
[2:59:55] we need a birth
[2:59:57] i want you to know you get a red hot
[2:59:59] fiery birth and the less you will want
[3:00:02] of this whole world
[3:00:05] oh you just won't want what you used to
[3:00:08] want
[3:00:09] you won't crave what you used to crave
[3:00:12] you'll cry out for more of god
[3:00:15] [Music]
[3:00:16] if you're finding condemnation in this
[3:00:18] you're finding it somewhere i don't know
[3:00:19] where you're finding it from because
[3:00:21] it's not in my heart i want to preach
[3:00:23] this to you i want to preach this
[3:00:25] through the internet i want to preach
[3:00:26] this wherever my voice will go the
[3:00:28] musicians are coming musicians are

[3:00:34] in my notes i want to share with you but
[3:00:36] tuesday night i will i wanted to talk
[3:00:39] about el shaddai
[3:00:42] i wanted to talk about the benefits
[3:00:46] of having a word birth
[3:00:49] when you've got a word birth he stands
[3:00:51] there ready
[3:00:54] to supply
[3:00:55] every
[3:00:57] need
[3:00:58] you have
[3:01:00] every need
[3:01:02] you have
[3:01:04] what if i didn't read a whole one but i
[3:01:06] just went and found
[3:01:07] a sentence
[3:01:09] as we're getting ready to close i
[3:01:11] feel like i've done a terrible
[3:01:13] job and
[3:01:15] and not in any way
[3:01:17] express my heart
[3:01:18] but i'll try it again
[3:01:21] i'll keep coming back till i get it
[3:01:28] in the message broken cisterns
[3:01:33] paragraph 134 i'll skip the other two
[3:01:36] he said like father abraham he never
[3:01:39] pulled he never fretted he never worried
[3:01:41] he had the word he laid upon el
[3:01:43] shaddai's breast
[3:01:47] does that make you uncomfortable
[3:01:52] it ought not to make you uncomfortable
[3:01:57] he laid upon el shaddai's breast when
[3:01:59] abraham was a hundred years old god
[3:02:01] appeared to him and said i am the
[3:02:03] almighty
[3:02:04] the hebrew word el shaddai means the
[3:02:06] breasted one and you are old and your
[3:02:09] strength is gone
[3:02:11] but just lay upon my bosom
[3:02:13] and nurse your strength from this
[3:02:15] fountain can you imagine god saying that
[3:02:17] abraham
[3:02:19] you're a hundred years old your strength
[3:02:21] is gone but i'm here to show you what i
[3:02:24] have
[3:02:26] just lay your head right here on my
[3:02:28] chest and find every answer
[3:02:32] every healing every deliverance
[3:02:35] every strength
[3:02:38] what he did he nursed himself to a new
[3:02:40] body
[3:02:41] you hear it
[3:02:43] he said what he did he nursed himself to
[3:02:45] a new what did he nurse himself to a new
[3:02:48] body
[3:02:50] he had the baby i wonder what you and i
[3:02:52] could nurse ourselves to
[3:02:56] i wonder what would happen if we were
[3:02:57] still finding ourself nursing from the
[3:02:59] from the breasts of el shaddai the one
[3:03:02] who says ever i'm the fountain of all
[3:03:04] life i'm the fountain of everything you
[3:03:06] have need of
[3:03:07] if you're here in this room and you
[3:03:10] don't know beyond the shadow of a doubt
[3:03:14] that you have been born again of the
[3:03:16] spirit of christ let me close by saying
[3:03:20] god has no grandchildren
[3:03:23] you may have parents that believe the
[3:03:25] truth grandparents that believe the
[3:03:26] truth great grandparents that believe
[3:03:28] the truth but that is only a portion of
[3:03:31] your of your inheritance or your legacy
[3:03:34] the legacy of your elders you get to
[3:03:36] enjoy some of the blessing and benefit
[3:03:38] of that but it does not guarantee your
[3:03:40] birth it does not guarantee your
[3:03:42] entrance into the kingdom of god i'm
[3:03:45] telling you there are seniors there
[3:03:47] there are there are middle-aged people
[3:03:49] in the body of christ that have come in
[3:03:51] from this that or the other denomination
[3:03:54] having no experience before they came in
[3:03:56] with god and and they're told things
[3:03:59] such as if you believe the message
[3:04:06] you have the holy ghost
[3:04:10] then the devil has the holy ghost
[3:04:16] because he knows the truth
[3:04:20] i'm just stuck i was rushing for you but
[3:04:22] i'm tired of that i'm not gonna do that
[3:04:25] somebody's listening to me now
[3:04:28] questions and answers number three this
[3:04:30] is it i i believe this is it
[3:04:33] this is question 354 do your children
[3:04:36] have to have an experience
[3:04:39] do your children have to have an
[3:04:40] experience to have the holy spirit
[3:04:43] if they see the end time message do they
[3:04:45] have the holy spirit this is a question
[3:04:47] ask brother branham in 1964
[3:04:49] and here's his answer in 2 18 every one
[3:04:53] must have an experience
[3:04:56] your children cannot go in on no other
[3:05:00] way but the same way you do see
[3:05:03] they've got to be
[3:05:06] born again
[3:05:08] there's no grandchildren in the kingdom
[3:05:10] of god they're all children they must
[3:05:13] have it must have an experience with god
[3:05:15] to go in just the same as you
[3:05:22] and how can they tell us
[3:05:25] if you believe the message you have the
[3:05:27] holy ghost
[3:05:30] when brother branham corrected that kind
[3:05:32] of thinking and he said you
[3:05:34] must have your own experience with god
[3:05:39] you've got to have the baptism of the
[3:05:40] holy ghost for yourself would you stand
[3:05:43] all over this room with me
[3:05:49] i
[3:06:02] ashley just play something
[3:06:04] even before he starts singing you can
[3:06:05] play that if you want to but just start
[3:06:07] start playing something here if you can
[3:06:09] you all you musicians do it for just a
[3:06:11] minute
[3:06:12] i want to ask the holy spirit
[3:06:18] i want to ask the holy spirit
[3:06:21] to come and speak the hearts here just a
[3:06:23] moment before we
[3:06:24] before we begin to worship and before we
[3:06:26] come to sort out our life with him
[3:06:29] [Music]
[3:06:32] i'd be the happiest man in this room
[3:06:36] if i could believe that every person
[3:06:37] here has had a real birth with jesus
[3:06:40] christ
[3:06:43] my mind is not going to one or another
[3:06:45] trying to figure out who i'm not doing
[3:06:46] that at all that's not my place this
[3:06:48] morning
[3:06:49] i'm just saying that this is the goal
[3:06:51] the goal is to get you to a place where
[3:06:53] you know
[3:06:55] that you know that you know
[3:06:57] that you know that you know
[3:07:00] that you're born again of the spirit of
[3:07:02] christ
[3:07:03] and that you've had your own personal
[3:07:05] experience with the holy ghost
[3:07:08] that's why we're here
[3:07:10] we'll grow after that we'll push up
[3:07:13] after that we'll feast on the word after
[3:07:15] that
[3:07:16] we'll grow in the grace of god after
[3:07:18] that we'll understand more about the
[3:07:20] message truth after that
[3:07:24] but we want to know that we know that we
[3:07:26] know that we know
[3:07:28] that we've had that experience with god
[3:07:32] i told you when i preached something
[3:07:33] like this not too long ago that paul had
[3:07:36] such a glorious conversion your
[3:07:38] conversion may not look like paul's
[3:07:42] but you don't have to have his
[3:07:43] experience
[3:07:45] you've got to have yours
[3:07:47] you've got to meet him
[3:07:49] with all the faith that you've got
[3:07:52] and believe that god wants to make a
[3:07:54] difference in your life i want you to
[3:07:55] just bow your head just a moment i don't
[3:07:58] often do a a a altar call like this
[3:08:02] but if you're in this room right now
[3:08:05] and you would say
[3:08:07] to me brother shelly i do not know
[3:08:11] for sure
[3:08:13] that i am born again
[3:08:15] and that i have had a true baptism of
[3:08:17] the holy ghost
[3:08:19] and i want to know that i am not trying
[3:08:22] to be a grandchild i want to know
[3:08:25] that i am a son of god
[3:08:27] and i just want to put up my hand and
[3:08:29] ask for prayer
[3:08:31] would you do that right now all over
[3:08:33] this room several hands
[3:08:35] are going up god bless every one of you
[3:08:40] in all likelihood many of these that are
[3:08:43] feeling this have already met god
[3:08:47] but i appreciate them being sensitive
[3:08:49] enough
[3:08:51] to the spirit of the lord that they
[3:08:53] would want to make sure
[3:08:56] and they'd go back and check again
[3:09:00] like the little song that they sung at
[3:09:03] easter time passover time
[3:09:05] where the little boy saw the daddy
[3:09:08] take the blood and put it over the door
[3:09:12] and the little boy goes to bed and he
[3:09:14] tries to go to sleep and he hears the
[3:09:16] sounds
[3:09:17] going through the city and the cries and
[3:09:19] screams and
[3:09:21] he says daddy daddy
[3:09:23] i want you to go and see one more time
[3:09:25] would you just check one more time and
[3:09:27] see if the blood is still there
[3:09:31] and the daddy said boy you were right
[3:09:33] there you saw me put the blood you know
[3:09:35] i put the blood you watched me do it
[3:09:38] he said i know i did daddy but would you
[3:09:40] just go one more time and make sure the
[3:09:42] blood is still there i appreciate the
[3:09:44] sensitive ones
[3:09:47] who raise their hand in every altar call
[3:09:50] or who come forward every time a message
[3:09:52] like this goes out i appreciate that i'm
[3:09:55] not calling that doubt this morning i'm
[3:09:58] telling you you're like that little boy
[3:10:00] you want to make sure that it's all
[3:10:01] right
[3:10:02] and i'd rather be like you i'd rather
[3:10:05] keep coming back and checking to make
[3:10:07] sure that everything is all right then
[3:10:09] to go on and live my life and not care
[3:10:11] what the word said and not care what my
[3:10:13] experience is with god
[3:10:16] if you're across this room and you
[3:10:18] raised your hand or you didn't raise
[3:10:20] your hand and you'd like to respond i'm
[3:10:22] inviting you to come this way right now
[3:10:24] some are already here for other reasons
[3:10:27] but or for whatever reason
[3:10:29] but if you're hearing you just say i
[3:10:31] want to make sure i want to check it up
[3:10:33] this morning
[3:10:34] i'm not ashamed to check it up
[3:10:37] i want to know that i know that i know
[3:10:39] that every sin is under the blood and
[3:10:42] that i'm living a sold out life for
[3:10:44] jesus christ
[3:10:47] i want to know that i've had a birth i
[3:10:48] don't want it to be some grandchild's
[3:10:50] testimony
