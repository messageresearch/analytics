[0:00] I want my ambition to be devoured and
[0:04] consumed I want my jealousy to be
[0:07] devoured and consumed I I want
[0:11] everything that is unlike him I want the
[0:14] Zeal for the house of the Lord and let
[0:18] me just say from the from the from the
[0:20] beginning here that we're not talking
[0:23] about this church building we're talking
[0:26] about what really makes up the Church of
[0:29] God what really makes up the elect Lady
[0:33] it's you and I we are the temple it's no
[0:38] longer a tent a tabernacle a mishcon
[0:42] it's no longer a a temple uh made of
[0:46] cedar a and of stone it's no longer just
[0:51] one body the body the physical Earthly
[0:55] Temple of the Lord Jesus Christ but now
[0:59] we as a body corporate Believers we are
[1:04] the manifestation of the word for this
[1:07] last day we've been preaching that Jesus
[1:11] must have the preeminence Among Us he
[1:15] must have the preeminence in our
[1:18] individual lives he must have the
[1:21] preeminence in our corporate gathering
[1:24] in our mission statement in our ministry
[1:28] purpose it must be Jesus having the
[1:32] preeminence the full Focus the full
[1:35] attention real Deliverance can only come
[1:39] in the name that is above every name the
[1:43] name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's not
[1:47] enough to call his name it's not enough
[1:51] to announce his name it's not enough to
[1:56] enunciate his name it's the life
[2:00] it's the life behind the
[2:04] name I I want you to know that there is
[2:08] a
[2:09] shoulder that you can lean on and when
[2:13] you walk away he you have never left him
[2:19] drained his battery isn't
[2:23] drained his gas tank isn't on
[2:26] empty you haven't leeched all the
[2:29] strength out of him come on there's a
[2:33] shoulder that you can lean on an
[2:35] everlasting arm that you can depend on
[2:38] there's a name that you can call on
[2:41] there's a place that you can bow your
[2:43] knee before the Lord and say I'm
[2:46] throwing myself on the Rock of Ages I
[2:50] might get broken but thank God he'll not
[2:54] have to crush me to
[2:57] powder because the Zeal
[3:00] of the house of the Lord not a
[3:04] building not a
[3:07] [Music]
[3:08] religion but the Zeal the
[3:12] passion the
[3:14] jealousy there's a root there's a root
[3:18] that's got to be discovered in this hour
[3:21] there's a root because the Zeal of thine
[3:24] house is supposed to be consuming this
[3:27] little bride in this hour it's the
[3:29] cleansing of the temple of God it has to
[3:33] come now it has to come in this hour and
[3:36] we can't put it off any longer we can't
[3:39] wait until another dispensation because
[3:42] this is the finality of all things the
[3:45] bride is already reaching into the
[3:47] bright age while the church is suffering
[3:50] the last few hours of leod deia there's
[3:53] never been a more appropriate time an
[3:56] expedient time than the time right now
[3:59] to be consumed by the Zeal of the house
[4:03] of the Lord the passion to be a
[4:07] temple that God can live
[4:10] in I've got to build the kingdom I've
[4:13] got to establish the kingdom and it
[4:15] doesn't start out it starts
[4:18] in I can't help build up the kingdom of
[4:22] God until I become a surrendered
[4:27] Kingdom the most important Zeal to have
[4:30] is one for this house of the Lord
[4:32] somebody said that seems selfish no you
[4:34] you're not trying to to build up
[4:37] yourself for prideful reason you're
[4:40] trying to give him a house to live in
[4:43] one that's sold out one that's
[4:45] surrendered one that's
[4:47] obedient one that doesn't have time to
[4:50] criticize other folk
