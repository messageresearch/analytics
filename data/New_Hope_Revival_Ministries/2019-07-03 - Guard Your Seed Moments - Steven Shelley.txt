TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if you don't fight for your beans the devil will take your taco your burrito and your whole enchilada if we don't fight for what we have for what God has given us the devil will take it and he will never give it back until somebody dares to face him nose to nose and say devil give it back in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ every person here has an enemy and it's not so much that you are his enemy but the Word of God that is in you is his enemy he is the enemy of God therefore he is an enemy of God's Word and the Word of God that is in you must come to fruition it has to come to maturity and expression and Satan opposes that so he steals it one beam at a time until there's no burrito left he doesn't just come in and snatch the whole thing all at one time because you would catch him and he knows that if you catch him he's really in trouble and here is something to remember you must never abandon your seed you cannot run off and leave it to grow on its own you cannot depend on someone who loves you to take care of your seed it's yours it is very very very personal you are represented in the seed that you sow I'm not just talking about the male seed of sperm either I'm talking about your gift your talent your time your finance you are represented in that seed so don't you get tired of waiting and walk off and holler to somebody else tend my garden it's your seed you are represented in that seed that you sowed and you've got to stay there and watch that seed if you can't war over the seed you've already planted you'll stop planting eventually it'll mean nothing to you being faithful to God's house will mean nothing to you being faithful in your giving will mean nothing to you having a right attitude and a right spirit when you come will mean nothing to you because the enemy has shut down with his with his crows he has shut down your your ability to see above and beyond your present circumstances I want you to know that a man who cannot see beyond today with hope and promise for the future is already dead he's a dead man walking he has no purpose for living if a man is convinced that he no longer has a seed to sow he has no reason to go on so you've got to take that back you've got to tell the devil he's a liar you've got to tell him God would leave you here one hour beyond your appointed time on this earth and if you're still kicking and breathing and moving and groaning you've still got a seed - so you still have value to release [Music]
