[0:59] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and I
[1:02] want to welcome you to the broadcast
[1:04] today we're coming together in
[1:07] partnership with our ministry new hope
[1:10] revival ministries and the gospel
[1:13] channel we are just tremendously blessed
[1:16] to have another opportunity to come and
[1:18] share the good news and the gospel of
[1:21] the Lord Jesus Christ before we get into
[1:24] the program today our format is going to
[1:26] be a little bit different because I once
[1:29] again have the privilege of introducing
[1:32] to you a great friend of our ministry
[1:35] someone that many of you are going to
[1:38] recognize and that is evangelist Gerald
[1:41] Hicks he shared a couple months back now
[1:45] his testimony and we had tremendous
[1:49] response people reaching out for prayer
[1:52] and people saying what a blessing his
[1:55] testimony was what an encouragement it
[1:58] was to them and in just a few minutes
[2:00] we're going to turn him loose and let
[2:03] him share whatever the Lord has placed
[2:05] on his heart for you and I today he
[2:08] ministered in our church last night and
[2:11] my what a powerful time we had and I
[2:14] wished I could have just hooked up the
[2:16] television camera and sent it live
[2:18] across Europe last night I know that you
[2:22] would have been tremendously blessed but
[2:25] before we get into that part of the
[2:26] program today I want to say to each one
[2:30] of you who have sent in your prayer
[2:32] request this folder is just full of your
[2:38] needs and also your testimonies many of
[2:42] you have taken the time to call the
[2:45] prayer line or to send an email to say
[2:48] that you have been strengthened that
[2:50] you've been encouraged that you've been
[2:52] blessed by the programs here others have
[2:55] shared urgent prayer requests and thanks
[2:59] be to God we now have added a few
[3:01] testimonies to this stack
[3:04] of those that God has moved already on
[3:07] your behalf he is a faithful God and no
[3:11] matter what the enemy would tell you he
[3:13] still answers prayer he is the same
[3:16] yesterday and today and forever and so I
[3:19] want to encourage you to send your
[3:23] prayer requests to us by email or you
[3:26] can call the prayer line just remember
[3:29] that there's a time difference between
[3:31] Alabama and most of where you are and so
[3:35] you may not get a live person but if you
[3:39] leave your prayer requests
[3:41] it'll be typed up just like these in the
[3:43] folder your needs your name if you leave
[3:47] your name it's there and what you're
[3:49] calling about what your prayer need is
[3:51] and we carry these to the Lord we hold
[3:54] them up before the Lord in every service
[3:56] when I go home they usually go home with
[3:59] me and when I have private time of
[4:01] prayer I take these needs sometimes I
[4:04] open up a stack wherever I turn to and
[4:08] just begin to read that need before the
[4:10] Lord why because we know what happens
[4:14] when we pray in faith we've seen what
[4:17] the Lord can do and we know that prayer
[4:20] is a gift it's a gift that God has given
[4:22] us to be able to lay our needs open
[4:26] before him the book of Matthew talks
[4:28] about a time when Jesus was coming along
[4:33] the way near Jericho and two blind men
[4:35] were there crying out to him the other
[4:38] Gospels mentioned only one man and they
[4:40] mentioned him by name Bartimaeus but in
[4:43] the book of Matthew it says there were
[4:45] two and their cries stop the master
[4:47] there their cries o son of David have
[4:51] mercy on us and it caught the Lord's
[4:54] attention in such a way that he stopped
[4:56] now we know it was very obvious what
[4:59] their need was they were blind even
[5:02] their clothes identified their handicap
[5:05] but Jesus in spite of it being very
[5:10] obvious he asked them what would you
[5:13] have me to do for you and it wasn't that
[5:16] G
[5:16] needed to know what their need was but
[5:19] he wanted them to articulate it he
[5:21] wanted to make sure they knew what they
[5:23] needed and sometimes I have found it to
[5:26] be very very powerful to be very
[5:28] specific when we pray now I don't just
[5:30] say Lord move when I'm really getting
[5:33] down to business
[5:34] I present the need thoroughly before the
[5:37] Lord you know I'm never disappointed
[5:38] even when the answer to my prayer is not
[5:42] exactly as I prayed it
[5:44] I trust the sovereignty of God and I
[5:48] can't ever remember a time and all these
[5:50] years of serving the Lord I can't ever
[5:52] remember a time that I felt like God did
[5:55] not answer my prayer many times it was
[5:58] exactly what I prayed it happened
[6:01] exactly the way that I asked it to be
[6:03] there were some times that I heard an
[6:06] answer and guess what the answer was no
[6:09] that's not what you need but I'll give
[6:13] you something better and he always asked
[6:15] and then there were other times that I
[6:18] thought I knew what the best solution
[6:21] would be so I humbly presented it to the
[6:23] Lord and he moved just not in the way
[6:27] that I expected him to but the answer
[6:29] was precious anyway and it taught me the
[6:32] faithfulness and sovereignty of God so I
[6:35] want to encourage you to pray I want to
[6:38] encourage you to let us join our faith
[6:40] together with your faith let's touch the
[6:43] Lord together and let's see what God can
[6:46] do so you feel free to send in your
[6:48] prayer requests also we've had many
[6:51] people who have mentioned the series
[6:53] that we've been doing schemes and
[6:56] devices and if you have missed one of
[6:59] those episodes we had a few people say I
[7:02] missed a couple of episodes and I feel
[7:05] like I need to go back and get the back
[7:07] material before I move on to the next
[7:10] you can do that on YouTube just do a
[7:13] search for New Hope revival ministries
[7:15] on YouTube you'll find our channel there
[7:18] every episode of the schemes and devices
[7:21] series will be there available Brother
[7:23] Hicks when he was with us the last time
[7:25] his testimony it's right there
[7:28] on YouTube and after today if you didn't
[7:32] hear the testimony you're going to want
[7:34] to go back I guarantee you're gonna want
[7:37] to go back and listen to the other
[7:39] program where he shared his life and how
[7:43] God just beautifully sovereignly
[7:46] lovingly orchestrated his life and has
[7:50] given him the powerful ministry that he
[7:52] has today you can find all of that on
[7:55] youtube under new hope revival
[7:57] ministries and there's a little
[7:59] subscribe button up at the top if you
[8:02] click on that you'll be notified from
[8:05] YouTube when we add new content I think
[8:09] that's a wonderful thing and it doesn't
[8:12] get on my nerves I subscribe to quite a
[8:14] few channels and I enjoy knowing when
[8:17] there's something new to see let me tell
[8:20] you something I believe that feeding on
[8:23] the word of God is the best pastime you
[8:25] can have it's not only entertaining
[8:28] because it thrills the inner man but it
[8:32] gives us the nutrition and the
[8:34] nourishment that we need to continue to
[8:37] grow in Christ there's so much garbage
[8:39] out there there's so much filth out
[8:42] there so much negative out there when I
[8:45] can get a hold of something that is
[8:47] life-giving something from the truth of
[8:51] God's Word it sustains me and
[8:53] strengthens me and I know that many of
[8:56] you feel the same way so at this time I
[8:59] want to just say again brother Hicks god
[9:03] bless you thank you for being with us
[9:05] today
[9:06] you know you were here quite early in in
[9:09] this setting when we were really just
[9:11] sort of getting started again in this
[9:14] little studio that the Lord has given us
[9:16] and your testimony not only touched me
[9:19] when you gave it in our church but it
[9:21] touched a lot of people out there and I
[9:23] hope you don't mind me saying this but I
[9:25] feel like that there were people who
[9:27] said in fact they wrote and said if God
[9:30] can use that little man if God can can
[9:33] do
[9:34] that in his life and orchestrate those
[9:36] circumstances it looked bad it looked
[9:39] bleak and it looked dark but God turned
[9:42] your life around to use for his glory
[9:43] and people wrote and said I know God can
[9:46] do something for me so your testimony on
[9:49] this program gave hope to a lot of
[9:51] people and I want to thank you for that
[9:53] well I certainly want to give God all of
[9:55] the praise the glory and the honor for
[9:58] that and I was thinking just a moment
[10:01] ago how that when we look in the Old
[10:04] Testament the book of kings and the life
[10:07] of the prophet Elijah we find out that
[10:11] uh he discovered a lady who was in a
[10:13] very dark hour of her life and she had
[10:17] lost her husband all she had left in the
[10:20] world that was dear to her or her two
[10:23] sons her husband died suddenly and in
[10:26] doing so he left behind a great debt
[10:29] with no provision to take care of that
[10:32] debt and this lady was was at her wits
[10:36] end her back was against the wall she
[10:39] had been pushed into a corner she just
[10:42] did not feel like there was any possible
[10:44] way out and eventually the day arrived
[10:47] when the creditor knocked on the door
[10:49] and gave her the information that she
[10:53] had dreaded to hear yes that she only
[10:55] had a certain amount of days to come up
[10:58] with a very large sum of money to take
[11:01] care of the debt and if she was not able
[11:04] to do so he was going to take the only
[11:07] thing she had left her two sons and was
[11:11] going to make slaves out of them no
[11:13] doubt when she closed the door behind
[11:15] her it must have been a very very dark
[11:20] hour for her
[11:21] and no doubt she was sinking in despair
[11:25] as many are today in our world there are
[11:29] so many many people who feel like they
[11:32] are literally sinking in a sea of
[11:35] despair they just do not really feel
[11:38] like they're ever gonna be able to pull
[11:40] themselves out of the hole they're in
[11:42] they wonder if they'll ever be able to
[11:45] see the light of day again and no doubt
[11:48] her son's tried to comfort her they
[11:52] tried to remain strong and confident
[11:54] they tried to assure her that somehow
[11:57] everything is going to be alright and in
[12:00] spite of wanting to believe everything
[12:03] they said she still struggled with the
[12:06] fact that how could things ever be all
[12:08] right as dark as it is right now
[12:11] but the day finally arrived when she
[12:15] realized that I have an answer an answer
[12:18] I don't know why I haven't thought of
[12:20] before now and she shared it with her
[12:22] sons she said I'm going to the Prophet
[12:25] I'm going to the man of God if anybody
[12:28] has an answer if anybody can help the
[12:32] Prophet the man of God will be able to
[12:34] help and so she quickly made her way to
[12:38] the man of God and no doubt she must
[12:41] have rehearsed in her mind over and over
[12:44] time and again exactly what she was
[12:47] going to say to the man of God and when
[12:49] she arrived she began to share her story
[12:52] and upon hearing the woman's story the
[12:55] man of God looked at this lady and asked
[12:58] her to very important questions number
[13:01] one what shall I do for thee and number
[13:05] two what do you have in your house these
[13:09] were not the questions she expected to
[13:12] hear fact is she really did not even
[13:15] know how to respond but when she was
[13:17] finally able to respond she simply told
[13:21] the man of God I don't have anything in
[13:24] my house it
[13:26] except a pot of oil I'm the man of God
[13:29] looked at this woman who thought she was
[13:31] in the darkest hour of her life and said
[13:34] go and borrow the vessels abroad of all
[13:38] thy neighbors even empty vessels
[13:41] borrowed not a few he said when you come
[13:45] in shut the door upon you and upon your
[13:48] sons and begin to pour out she left the
[13:52] man of God a little bewildered no doubt
[13:56] his response was not at all what she
[13:59] expected it was not at all what she
[14:02] anticipated because she probably thought
[14:05] in her mind once I share my story with
[14:08] the man of God he's probably gonna pull
[14:12] out some money and give it to me from
[14:14] the church Treasury and say pay your
[14:17] debt and live happily ever after
[14:20] or perhaps the man of God is going to
[14:22] get me an audience with the king and
[14:25] when the King hears my pitiful plight
[14:27] he's gonna order that my debt be
[14:29] forgiven me however that's not at all
[14:32] what happened the man of God said go and
[14:35] borrow the vessels abroad of all thy
[14:38] neighbors that's not what she wanted to
[14:41] hear that's not what she expected
[14:43] sometimes what we hear from God
[14:46] sometimes what we hear from the Word of
[14:48] God is not always what we expect it's
[14:52] not always what we want but in the end
[14:55] it's always what we need and when she
[14:59] when she reached her house her boys were
[15:02] anxious they wanted to know what the
[15:04] outcome of the visit had been and they
[15:06] were so surprised when she shared the
[15:09] story no doubt they must have shook
[15:12] their heads in disbelief they must have
[15:14] said one to another there has to be a
[15:17] better way there has to be something
[15:20] that's more certain that's more sure
[15:22] than this but with a deadline staring
[15:26] them in the face with all of their
[15:28] options exhausted with all of their
[15:31] avenues travelled down
[15:32] they finally decided at the last moment
[15:36] that they would just see if what the man
[15:40] of God said would work and so they got
[15:43] the old wagon out of the barn started
[15:45] down the road and before very long the
[15:48] talk of the entire neighborhood was what
[15:51] in the world of is the widows to Boaz
[15:54] going to do with all of these vessels
[15:57] that they have borrowed when they could
[16:00] not borrow another vessel they unloaded
[16:03] them and can you imagine what it must
[16:05] have been like they were standing in a
[16:08] room surrounded with empty vessels and
[16:11] they were looking at their mother
[16:13] holding a very small vessel of oil in
[16:17] her hand when she finally said bring me
[16:21] a vessel and they brought that vessel
[16:24] and she began to pour out and before
[16:27] long it was full and she set it aside
[16:29] and she asked for another vessel before
[16:33] long it was full and she set that one
[16:35] aside that owned and owned and all until
[16:40] finally she looks at her sons and says
[16:42] bring me another vessel and her boys are
[16:46] standing there with their eyes wide and
[16:49] their mouth gaped open saying there's
[16:52] not a vessel more there's not a vessel
[16:55] more what a beautiful thing that she
[16:58] watched as God miraculously filled up
[17:02] every single empty vessel raised with
[17:05] that valuable oil man she went back to
[17:09] the man of God she was so excited to
[17:12] tell him what had happened and the man
[17:14] of God didn't even get excited he knew
[17:16] exactly what was going to happen and he
[17:19] gave her the command go sell the oil pay
[17:23] their debt and live thou and thy
[17:27] children of the rest of imagine that God
[17:31] not only was concerned about taking care
[17:35] of her present debt
[17:37] but he also wanted to provide her with
[17:40] future provision for her family and the
[17:44] beautiful moral of the story is simply
[17:46] this that when we trust God he can take
[17:50] our nothing come on he can touch it in
[17:53] just the right way and he can make
[17:55] something out of it but not only can God
[17:58] take nothing touch it in just the right
[18:01] way and make something out of it
[18:04] God can also find a nobody somebody
[18:07] whose life is broken somebody's whose
[18:10] life is in shambles of somebody their
[18:13] life is is torn apart by hurt and
[18:16] despair and despondency and he can touch
[18:20] them in just the right way thank you
[18:22] I'll make somebody out of them and we
[18:25] see that God is doing that today he's
[18:28] doing that today in many many places
[18:30] where people finally decide that I'm
[18:34] gonna give God an opportunity I saw a
[18:37] young man the other day I could see the
[18:39] brokenness that was in his heart I could
[18:42] see the brokenness that was in his life
[18:44] and I looked at that young man and I
[18:46] said you know you've tried all of the
[18:48] rest of now what you really need to do
[18:51] is try the best and that's really what I
[18:54] would like to say to somebody today I
[18:56] would like to say that you have tried
[18:58] the rest and you've been hurt and you've
[19:02] been let down and you're still broken
[19:04] and you're still in a world that's
[19:07] filled with despair and despondency
[19:10] but now try the best of try Jesus he'll
[19:14] never let you down he'll never fail you
[19:17] amen
[19:18] Absalom and brother that is so
[19:20] encouraging and he just took what she
[19:23] had which wasn't much right but all what
[19:26] a difference it made when Jesus got
[19:28] involved or when the Prophet got
[19:30] involved in that story share something
[19:33] else just whatever is on your heart
[19:35] that's your camera yes sir and there's
[19:37] no need for me to interrupt you know
[19:39] it's it's amazing today that God has a
[19:42] very very special way
[19:44] at taking nothing touching it in just
[19:48] the right way and making something out
[19:51] of it I think perhaps one of my favorite
[19:54] stories in all of the entire Bible
[19:57] especially the Old Testament must be the
[20:00] account of Elijah the Prophet you know
[20:03] in a time of drought in a time when
[20:06] others were searching desperately for
[20:09] something to eat they were searching
[20:11] desperately for provision physically the
[20:15] Lord had spoke to this prophet and said
[20:17] go into the wilderness go into the
[20:20] desert that was a barren place that was
[20:23] a forsaken place that was a forgotten
[20:26] place don't you know there are many many
[20:29] people today who feel like that
[20:32] unfortunate circumstances of unfortunate
[20:35] events in their life have forced them
[20:39] into a barren place active force them
[20:42] into a wilderness force them into a
[20:44] desert place and no doubt when he
[20:47] arrived in that wilderness of he must
[20:50] have wondered that where is my provision
[20:53] going to come from where am I gonna find
[20:55] food where am I gonna find water and
[20:58] little did he know that God had already
[21:02] divinely commissioned a raven of all
[21:06] birds a raven to bring him bread and
[21:10] flesh in the morning to eat bread and
[21:13] flesh in the evening to dorita he was
[21:17] able to drink water out of the brook and
[21:20] as long as God wanted him to stay there
[21:23] the Ravens brought him bread and flesh
[21:26] and he drank water out of the brook and
[21:29] when it was time for him to leave that
[21:31] wilderness when his time of being alone
[21:36] his time of being in solitude was over
[21:39] God had divinely commissioned that now
[21:43] not a raven but a widow of all people
[21:46] who was going to be able to divinely
[21:49] take care of him but little did the
[21:52] know that when she decided to take care
[21:55] of the Prophet that God was going to
[21:58] open a door for provision in her life
[22:01] God said leave the wilderness go to the
[22:05] gate of the city when you arrive at the
[22:08] gate of the city he told the prophet
[22:10] Elijah you'll find a woman there
[22:13] she'll be gathering sticks and that
[22:16] woman will be able to sustain thee that
[22:20] woman's going to have the provision to
[22:22] take care of you when he lied to made
[22:25] his way to the gate of the city he had
[22:28] no idea that that woman was coming in
[22:31] the opposite direction at the same time
[22:34] she would be there gathering sticks if
[22:37] she had no idea that she was going to
[22:40] encounter a prophet a man of God that
[22:42] would ultimately change the entire
[22:46] course of her future when she arrived at
[22:49] the city gate begun to gather her sticks
[22:52] the prophet of God came walking up
[22:55] without really even exchanging
[22:57] pleasantries he just simply asked the
[23:00] woman would you fetch me a vessel of
[23:04] water that I might drink out of the
[23:06] kindness of her heart she turned to get
[23:09] the man of God the Prophet some water to
[23:12] drink he said excuse me while you're at
[23:15] it would you bring me a little cake of
[23:17] bread that I might eat also now I can
[23:21] just see this woman in my mind's eye as
[23:24] she spins around on her he olap she must
[23:27] have put her hand on her hip and said
[23:29] wait a minute
[23:30] a vessel of water to drink is one thing
[23:33] but a cake of bread to eat is entirely
[23:37] another you must understand that all I
[23:41] have left in all of the world is just a
[23:45] handful of meal in a barrel and a little
[23:49] all in a cruise of however the man of
[23:52] God said go
[23:55] do as thou has said but bake me a little
[23:59] cake first bring it to me that I might
[24:02] eat and so I can see this woman as she
[24:05] turns and as she starts to walk away she
[24:09] must have been thinking about that boy
[24:11] who was laying at home on his stomach
[24:14] must have been growling she had already
[24:17] resigned herself to the fact that she
[24:20] and her son were going to eat their very
[24:23] last meal and die she had already
[24:27] resigned herself to the fact that
[24:30] without a miracle without something
[24:33] miraculous taking place she was going to
[24:36] eat her very last meal she had no idea
[24:40] that she was going to encounter a
[24:41] prophet she had no idea that she was
[24:44] going to hear a word from the Lord that
[24:47] if she chose to implement if she chose
[24:51] to believe if she chose to put it into
[24:55] action in her life it was gonna turn her
[24:58] world upside down
[25:00] and so as she's walking away she must
[25:03] have started thinking one more cake of
[25:06] bread is not gonna make me any better or
[25:10] any worse if God don't step on the same
[25:14] yeah one more cake of bread is not gonna
[25:17] make me any better or any worse if God
[25:20] doesn't somehow stretch out his hand and
[25:24] go to work in my life and so it is that
[25:28] she went in she poured the meal out of
[25:31] the barrel she poured the oil out of the
[25:34] cruse if she made the tiny cake of bread
[25:37] she got the vessel of water she took it
[25:40] to the man of God she gave it to him he
[25:43] blessed it he ate it and then he told
[25:47] her now go and make for you and for your
[25:50] son and live now the writers of
[25:54] antiquity tell us that the drought
[25:56] lasted about a hundred more
[25:58] days and for the space of a hundred days
[26:01] or as long as the drought lasted it made
[26:06] no difference how many times
[26:08] day or night that woman went to the meal
[26:12] barrel the Bible said the meal wasted
[26:16] not no matter how many times she poured
[26:20] out of the cruse of oil the Bible said
[26:23] the cruse of oil that did not fail
[26:27] imagine while others were dying of
[26:31] starvation while others were searching
[26:34] frantically in every place they could
[26:37] think of for a morsel of food to eat no
[26:41] matter how many times they or night this
[26:45] woman decided to go to the meal barrel
[26:48] or the cruse of oil the Bible said the
[26:51] meal wasted not and the cruse of oil did
[26:56] not fail because she decided to believe
[27:00] the word of the Lord I can promise you
[27:04] today yes that the word of the Lord is
[27:07] true I can promise you today that the
[27:10] word of the Lord is trusted a man you
[27:13] can trust the Word of God today fact is
[27:17] he even invites us in other places to
[27:22] prove him yes hallelujah the fact is if
[27:25] he encourages us to put him to the test
[27:29] because he literally wants to roll up
[27:33] his sleeves and he wants to go to work
[27:36] in our life one writer said it like this
[27:39] God will work but who will let him I
[27:44] want to challenge somebody today no
[27:47] matter where you are in life no matter
[27:50] how you feel
[27:52] no matter what you're going through no
[27:54] matter what your face and give God an
[27:58] opportunity to go to work in your life
[28:01] yes you might say you don't know what
[28:03] the doctor has said you haven't seen the
[28:06] x-ray you don't feel the pain you don't
[28:10] understand the hurt but I can promise
[28:13] you today that God is a mighty God he is
[28:17] a magnificent wonderful God who wants to
[28:21] go to work in your life he wants to heal
[28:25] if you're sick he wants to deliver if
[28:28] you're bound he wants to set free if
[28:31] you're held captive he wants to make
[28:34] well today if you have wrestled with
[28:38] physical pain in your life he just
[28:41] simply wants you to give him the
[28:44] opportunity to work in your life see God
[28:48] wants to take your nothing whatever that
[28:51] might be yes and he wants to touch it
[28:54] and make something out of it man perhaps
[28:57] today you feel like a nobody maybe your
[29:00] dreams are broken maybe your heart is
[29:03] broken maybe your home is broken maybe
[29:06] your relationship is broken but today
[29:10] God is a specialist is taking broken
[29:14] things and putting them back together
[29:17] and what I have discovered in my own
[29:19] life is that when God puts the broken
[29:23] back together it's often much more value
[29:27] than it was before it was ever broke
[29:30] amen brother yes praise God and so I
[29:33] want to challenge somebody today I want
[29:35] to encourage somebody today to just
[29:39] simply allow God to take whatever they
[29:43] have touch it in just the right way and
[29:46] make something out of it and you know
[29:49] it's just been on my heart now for days
[29:52] I don't know exactly why but I just have
[29:55] been thinking over and over and over
[29:57] again about those 10 lepers who came to
[30:01] Jesus and Jesus willingly cleanse them
[30:06] of their leprosy and we know how dreaded
[30:10] leprosy is we know that leprosy
[30:14] ostracized and separated and isolated
[30:18] individuals we know that according to
[30:20] the Old Testament and the New Testament
[30:22] that if someone had leprosy they had to
[30:26] live without the campus they had to be
[30:29] separated from their companions they had
[30:32] to be separated from their children they
[30:34] had to be separated from the people that
[30:36] they loved and they cared about and we
[30:40] know that leprosy was so horrible that
[30:44] it literally would eat away the very
[30:47] appendages of the human body it would
[30:50] eat away the ears on the side of your
[30:52] head it would eat away the nose on the
[30:55] front of your face it would eat your
[30:57] fingers off of your hand your toes off
[31:00] of your feet it was a very very dreaded
[31:03] thing and here art in leprous men who
[31:08] come to the Lord Jesus and they cry out
[31:11] to Jesus for him to cleanse them of
[31:14] their leprosy and the Lord Jesus has
[31:18] mercy upon them and he cleanses them
[31:22] divinely of their leprosy and he gives
[31:25] them a command to go and to show
[31:29] themselves to the priests so that the
[31:31] priest can publicly pronounce that they
[31:35] are cleansed when the priests made the
[31:38] public Proclamation that they were
[31:41] cleansed that simply meant they were no
[31:44] longer contagious praise God that they
[31:48] could be invited back into the camp they
[31:51] could be invited back into the home they
[31:54] could be invited back into the city a
[31:57] man and so they were anxious to go to
[32:00] the priest and ma how they must have
[32:03] felt when the priest pronounced over
[32:07] them you
[32:08] now cleansed you are now clean these ten
[32:12] lepers were excited they were anxious to
[32:16] get back to their families to get back
[32:19] to their children to get back to their
[32:21] homes to get back to the people they
[32:23] loved the most and as they started that
[32:26] direction something happened in the life
[32:30] of one of those men something took place
[32:33] of this in the life of one of those men
[32:35] as he started toward his house he
[32:39] stopped somewhere in the middle of his
[32:41] journey and he said I cannot take
[32:44] another step forward toward the people I
[32:47] love until I turn around and give the
[32:51] Lord thanks did you know there's
[32:54] somebody today yep who needs to stop
[32:56] what they're doing they need to stop
[32:59] where they are in the middle of
[33:01] everything that's going on around them
[33:03] they just simply need to give the Lord
[33:07] Jesus Christ something yes sir
[33:10] hallelujah the Bible did not say give
[33:13] thanks for all things sometimes we
[33:18] interpret that passage to say that and
[33:21] you know what we scratch our head and we
[33:24] wonder how can I thank God for heart
[33:26] trouble mm-hmm how can I thank God for
[33:29] cancer how can I thank God for arthritis
[33:33] how can I thank God for a companion that
[33:37] is not in the church how can I thank God
[33:39] for a wayward child who's not concerned
[33:42] about their eternal destination that
[33:46] passage does not tell us no to thank God
[33:49] for those things that passage simply
[33:52] tells us in everything give thanks
[33:56] that's in everything give thanks for
[34:00] this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
[34:05] concerning you I may not be able to
[34:09] thank God for cancer right
[34:12] in the middle of it I can give y'all may
[34:17] not be able to thank God for bankruptcy
[34:20] but in the middle of it I can give God
[34:24] thank you
[34:25] there's something about looking beyond
[34:28] the hurt and the pain and the loss of
[34:32] and just simply deciding to give God
[34:36] thanks so let's mote will miraculously
[34:39] bring heaven down to where you are but
[34:43] not only will it bring heaven down to
[34:45] where you are it will lift you up yes to
[34:48] where he is hallelujah and so it is that
[34:52] that Lipper turned and started back to
[34:55] Jesus and when he reached the place
[34:59] where the Lord Jesus was at the Lord
[35:03] Jesus wanted to know what have you come
[35:06] back for and that leper said the priest
[35:10] has pronounced cleansing and I cannot go
[35:14] anywhere else until I say thank you
[35:18] Jesus was astounded imagine how he must
[35:24] have felt as he's looking at this leper
[35:29] who could have been now with his family
[35:34] embracing the ones that he loved and
[35:36] cared about so much yes but instead of
[35:40] going to them he turns to the Lord Jesus
[35:43] Christ and says I want to give you thank
[35:47] you the Lord said were there not ten
[35:51] cleansed this leper shook his head yes
[35:57] there were ten cleansed jesus asked the
[36:02] question where are the nine where are
[36:08] the nine why is it that you are the only
[36:12] one who decided to come back and give
[36:16] things understand that this leper had no
[36:20] ulterior motive he did not have anything
[36:24] else in mind he would have been
[36:26] perfectly satisfied had the Lord Jesus
[36:30] not said anything else and he turned and
[36:34] walked away but when he decided to give
[36:38] the Lord some things yes the Lord Jesus
[36:42] said because you have decided to come
[36:46] back and give thanks now go on your way
[36:50] and be thou made whole hallelujah I
[36:56] believe that we are entering a season
[36:59] where God wants to take the broken and
[37:02] make them whole when they decide to give
[37:07] him thanks I believe that God wants to
[37:09] reach down and he wants to touch the
[37:13] heard SS and make them whole when they
[37:16] decide to simply give the Lord things
[37:19] somebody said what does that really mean
[37:22] there were nine lepers although they
[37:26] were clean clean and being clean is
[37:29] wonderful it made no difference where
[37:33] they went in life they still carried in
[37:38] their bodies the science core of their
[37:41] leprosy while they still carried in
[37:44] their physical body the scar is resting
[37:47] of their leprosy by my mom but here is
[37:50] one leper it made no difference where he
[37:53] went in life no bomb I ever knew that he
[37:58] had encountered leprosy at school why
[38:00] because not only it was he cleanse but
[38:04] because he decided to give the Lord
[38:08] Jesus some thanks the Lord Jesus went
[38:13] one step beyond cleansing and made him
[38:16] whole hallelujah I believe there's some
[38:19] people today that need more than just a
[38:23] cleansing we do what they need is to be
[38:26] made whole yes hallelujah I believe
[38:29] there are some people today that need
[38:32] more than just their sin to be forgiven
[38:35] right but what they truly need yes they
[38:39] need their sin to be remitted yes they
[38:42] need their sin to be removed from them
[38:45] them all they need their sin to be cast
[38:48] as far from this earth as the East is
[38:52] from the West never to be remembered
[38:55] against them anymore hallelu hallelu
[38:59] when our sin is remitted when our sin is
[39:03] removed we're like that leper who turned
[39:07] and gave the Lord thanks and he makes us
[39:11] Oh hallelujah I don't just want to be
[39:15] cleansed I don't just want to be clean
[39:18] but I want to be whole I want to be
[39:21] complete I want to be restored no doubt
[39:25] there are some things that we need to be
[39:29] restored some me joy restored some need
[39:34] hope restored some need health restored
[39:38] some need of their minds of to be
[39:42] restored they've been so clouded and so
[39:45] confused by the things around them
[39:49] oftentimes they don't know where they're
[39:52] at and what they're doing and where
[39:54] they're gonna go next even if they're
[39:57] gonna be able to to survive another day
[39:59] but oh there's a great guy today Jesus
[40:04] who is alive and he's on his throne yes
[40:07] and he's just as mighty he's just as
[40:11] able he's just as capable today as he's
[40:15] always been and the wonderful thing is
[40:18] that God's not only capable but the God
[40:21] that we serve today is willing to touch
[40:25] those that will reach out to him he's
[40:28] willing to touch those that will call
[40:31] upon him God will not turn away the one
[40:36] that calls on him God will not turn his
[40:39] face from the man of
[40:41] woman the boy or the girl whoever they
[40:44] are wherever they are no matter what
[40:47] they're going through no matter what
[40:49] they have or do not have God will never
[40:53] turn his face from the individual who
[40:56] decides to cry out and call upon him and
[41:01] I just believe today that there's some
[41:04] people that have been stricken by sin
[41:07] that have been starved by sin the same
[41:12] way this individual was scarred by
[41:15] leprosy amen and it's the blood of Jesus
[41:18] that cleanses us today from all of our
[41:22] sin a man but thank God not only does he
[41:26] want to cleanse us but if we'll just be
[41:29] willing to give him some thanks he'll go
[41:32] one step beyond cleansing and he'll make
[41:36] us whole that simply means that old
[41:39] things pass away and behold everything
[41:43] will become new just a few days ago I
[41:46] was talking with someone and after
[41:48] preaching and I having a beautiful
[41:51] service a young man walked up to me and
[41:54] he put his arms around me embraced me
[41:57] and he said brother Hicks he said I am
[42:00] convinced the way you preach today and
[42:03] the things that you said and the way
[42:05] that God used you you must have a
[42:08] wonderful set of parents that must have
[42:12] raised you in a wonderful home you must
[42:15] have had a wonderful pastor and you must
[42:17] have grown up in a wonderful church and
[42:20] you must be third or fourth generation
[42:23] in the church and I looked at that young
[42:26] man and I said I wish that were the case
[42:29] however it's not I said you have no idea
[42:34] the road that I walked down you have no
[42:37] idea that I was one of those that came
[42:40] from far that's right I came from far I
[42:44] had to travel a long
[42:46] and it was a winding road it was a dusty
[42:49] road it was a road that was filled with
[42:53] twists and turns and crooks and bends it
[42:57] was a road that was full of obstacles
[42:59] and pitfalls and potholes all along the
[43:03] way but you know what God brought me
[43:06] down that road because of he wanted to
[43:10] bring me to him hallelujah and I am so
[43:14] thankful today that regardless of how
[43:17] broken your life might be God knows how
[43:21] to take the broken pieces and put them
[43:24] back to guess again God knows how to
[43:27] take that
[43:28] that's been scarred and marred by sin
[43:32] and he knows how to touch it in just the
[43:35] right way fact is where I come from
[43:38] we like to say that God is the one who
[43:42] can take a black heart he can wash it in
[43:45] red blood and he can make it white as
[43:49] snow and I'm so thankful today for my
[43:52] brother Hicks I'm focusing in my mind on
[43:56] the word wholeness I don't know if I've
[43:59] ever heard it brought out the way you
[44:01] brought it out with the ten lepers and
[44:03] what a blessing that is I'm thinking of
[44:05] we have a promise of wholeness of being
[44:08] made whole body soul and spirit and and
[44:13] I'd like for you to just speak a word
[44:14] about what what God can do for those who
[44:18] need to be restored not not just like
[44:21] the lepers with their external physical
[44:24] scars what was left over from the
[44:27] leprosy but but the inside you know I'm
[44:30] thinking about that portion of your
[44:31] testimony and I think you told us about
[44:34] anger I think that you were you had
[44:36] dealt with a lot of things growing up
[44:38] initially and and just speak to someone
[44:41] who's watching this program who doesn't
[44:45] maybe need wholeness in the body but
[44:48] they recognize that there's a big hole
[44:52] in the inside there they're carrying
[44:54] scars maybe they've already come to the
[44:56] Lord but they haven't got wholeness they
[44:59] haven't haven't found that key speak to
[45:01] that would you yes absolutely the fact
[45:04] is today that many many of us we can
[45:08] smile and we look so well we look so
[45:12] healthy and so hold on the outside
[45:16] however many many today are broken yes
[45:20] and they are hurting and they are needy
[45:23] deep deep down on the inside their
[45:27] emotional hurt and their spiritual yes
[45:31] and their mental hurt is such that often
[45:35] people wonder if they can ever ever
[45:38] overcome these things and I like to to
[45:42] kind of tell people that sometimes what
[45:45] we need to do to become whole again is
[45:48] that we need to just pick up what we
[45:51] have left we we just need to pick up
[45:54] what's left we don't need to focus on
[45:57] what we no longer have sometimes that's
[46:00] where we find ourself and sometimes we
[46:04] trap ourselves so good in that position
[46:07] where all we want to do is focus on what
[46:11] we no longer have and if we do that we
[46:17] find ourselves with our head hung down
[46:19] right we find ourselves having a pity
[46:22] party like sorry for ourselves right and
[46:27] when we have a pity party and we feel
[46:29] sorry for ourselves we just sink further
[46:32] and further and further into the
[46:36] darkness and the despair that already
[46:39] surrounds us so true however if we could
[46:43] just somehow forget about what we no
[46:46] longer have forget about what we no
[46:49] longer can put our hands on and just
[46:53] simply pick up what we have left
[46:56] remember he told the disciples after he
[47:00] had miraculously multiplied
[47:02] a little boys lunch that was only five
[47:06] loaves and two small fish it's always
[47:10] amazed me that the Bible said two small
[47:13] fish right and so it is that it's
[47:17] apparent that it only seemed like enough
[47:20] for just a handful maybe three or four
[47:23] at the most
[47:24] to eat and to be filled on however that
[47:28] little boy was willing to give what he
[47:31] had toward and today for us to be healed
[47:35] and to be whole on the inside we have to
[47:39] become willing to give God whatever we
[47:43] have laid yes sir amen the little boy
[47:45] was willingness to give God what he had
[47:48] left he understood it might not be very
[47:52] much right it may only be able at this
[47:55] moment to feed just a handful however
[47:59] I'm willing to give you what I have and
[48:03] that's really what God wants today yes I
[48:06] believe that I believe that that inner
[48:08] healing begins when we simply decide to
[48:13] give God what we have lau that's very
[48:16] hard to give him what's left is short
[48:19] give him what's left of our mind give
[48:22] him what's left of our life whatever it
[48:25] might be no matter how broken it might
[48:29] be to us no matter how broken it might
[48:32] appear to someone right so what we
[48:35] simply need to do is just pick up the
[48:38] broken pieces pick up what we have left
[48:41] and we just need to willingly place it
[48:45] tenderly in the hands of God yes because
[48:49] he is able today to take what we have
[48:53] left and make something miraculous
[48:57] when they started to pick up the King
[49:01] James said gather up the fragments that
[49:05] remain when they started to gather they
[49:08] started to pick up what was left they
[49:11] were amazed because when they were
[49:14] finished they picked up twelve baskets
[49:18] full yes of fragments over above and
[49:23] beyond that what had been eaten after
[49:27] five thousand million plus women and
[49:30] children had eaten all that they could
[49:33] hold praise God and so it is that when
[49:38] we pick up what's left whatever it might
[49:41] be and we just simply give it to God we
[49:45] just simply place it in his hand yes he
[49:49] has a divine way oh yes taking what's
[49:53] left and making something of the powder
[49:57] time I see God can take your mess yeah
[50:00] and he can touch it in a miraculous way
[50:03] here this you can make something
[50:06] magnificent out of a today God wants to
[50:10] take what we might consider a mess and
[50:13] he wants to touch it and turn it into a
[50:16] masterpiece yes please God that's really
