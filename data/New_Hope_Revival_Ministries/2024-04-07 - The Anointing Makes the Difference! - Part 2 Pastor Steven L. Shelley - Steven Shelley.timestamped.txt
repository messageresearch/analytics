[1:22:21] best we're just happy to be in the house
[1:22:24] of the Lord Lord
[1:22:25] tonight I uh I have been asked several
[1:22:28] times if I am rested no I'm not rested
[1:22:31] are you over jet lag no I'm not quite
[1:22:34] over jet lag yet if you've never
[1:22:37] traveled abroad and been 7,000 miles
[1:22:39] away from home with an 11-hour flight
[1:22:43] and a three-hour layover and another
[1:22:45] 2hour flight that ended with an hour and
[1:22:48] a half being stuck on the tarmac in New
[1:22:52] York in JFK Anno in
[1:22:55] Atlanta because there was lightning in
[1:22:57] the air and if that doesn't make you
[1:23:00] nervous enough the airplane that had
[1:23:03] backed out of our gate to take off broke
[1:23:09] down at the gate and couldn't even start
[1:23:14] up I don't know do you crank an airplane
[1:23:16] I don't know it couldn't even start up
[1:23:19] they had to they had to come and tow the
[1:23:22] airplane now I'd have been some happy if
[1:23:24] I was on that plane I'd have been a
[1:23:25] happy man thank you Lord that if it was
[1:23:28] going to stop working it stopped on the
[1:23:31] ground instead of in the air but there
[1:23:33] was a little lightning and a tornado in
[1:23:35] North Atlanta and so we were stuck an
[1:23:38] hour and a half on an airplane with
[1:23:41] people who desperately wanted to get off
[1:23:43] and no one wanted off anymore than I did
[1:23:47] I actually sat there thinking oh Lord if
[1:23:50] you don't help me tomorrow there's going
[1:23:52] to be a video going all over the world
[1:23:54] of me just
[1:23:57] screaming you seen any of those videos
[1:24:00] where people just lose it on the
[1:24:01] airplane I said Lord if you don't come

[1:30:26] faith is so high you just remind them of

[1:33:07] asleep now I'm going to tell you what
[1:33:08] the need is and we're going to believe
[1:33:10] God to meet the
[1:33:12] need and he
[1:33:15] did God is a good god he's the same amen
[1:33:20] Isaiah 61 verse 1 and two the spirit of
[1:33:24] the Lord God is upon me because the Lord
[1:33:28] hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings
[1:33:31] unto the meek he has sent me to bind up
[1:33:35] the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to
[1:33:38] the captives and the opening of the
[1:33:41] prison to them that are bound to
[1:33:45] proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:33:49] the day of Vengeance of our God to come
[1:33:53] Comfort all that mourn then we're going
[1:33:57] to Luke 4 verse 17- 22 this is where we
[1:34:02] were when I left you just a over a week
[1:34:05] ago and there was delivered unto him the
[1:34:08] book of The Prophet Isaias and when he
[1:34:11] had opened the book he found the place
[1:34:14] where it was written the spirit of the
[1:34:17] Lord is upon me does that sound familiar
[1:34:20] to you to preach the gospel to the poor
[1:34:23] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:34:25] to preach Deliverance to the captives
[1:34:28] and recovering of sight to the blind to
[1:34:31] set it Liberty them that are bruised to
[1:34:35] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:34:39] in the original language it says to to
[1:34:43] uh to preach the year of the favor of
[1:34:47] the Lord the Lord's favor the acceptable
[1:34:51] year of the Lord and he closed the book
[1:34:54] it wasn't a book there was no such thing
[1:34:56] as a book for another 300 years it was a
[1:35:00] scroll and he gave it again to the
[1:35:02] minister and sat down and the eyes of
[1:35:06] all them that were in the synagogue were
[1:35:09] fastened on him and he began to say unto
[1:35:12] them this
[1:35:15] day this
[1:35:17] day this day is this scripture fulfilled
[1:35:22] in your ears
[1:35:24] how many of you count it a privilege
[1:35:26] tonight to be living in a day like that
[1:35:29] day where we as his bride can say we're
[1:35:33] living in a day when the scripture is
[1:35:36] being fulfilled in our
[1:35:39] ears oh what a blessing and all bear him
[1:35:43] witness and wondered at the gracious
[1:35:45] Words which proceeded out of his mouth
[1:35:49] and they said is not this Joseph's son
[1:35:54] now King James says they marveled or
[1:35:57] wondered at the gracious words the
[1:36:00] original literal translation of the
[1:36:02] Greek says and he gave them the message
[1:36:06] of
[1:36:07] Grace no wonder they marveled it was a
[1:36:11] new message to them they understood the
[1:36:14] Commandments they understood the Torah
[1:36:17] they understood the prophets but they
[1:36:20] did not understand for they had never
[1:36:22] heard before the message of Grace how
[1:36:26] many of you are glad tonight that you've
[1:36:28] not only heard the message of Grace but
[1:36:32] you become a personal participant you

[1:36:57] utterance that was given earlier that
[1:37:00] this was a time of refreshing I receive
[1:37:03] that in the name of the Lord Jesus

[1:37:35] above every name the name of the Lord

[1:37:41] Saints said amen amen you may be seated
[1:37:44] this evening I want to give you just a a
[1:37:49] a a few
[1:37:50] moments of review from where we were
[1:37:55] when we left you uh uh T not not last
[1:37:59] Sunday but Sunday before last we are uh
[1:38:04] talking about the the fifth
[1:38:07] utterance from a vision a Visionary
[1:38:11] experience that the lord gave me at the
[1:38:14] beginning of the year just as we were
[1:38:17] transitioning on the Gregorian calendar
[1:38:21] into the year of 20
[1:38:24] 24 um before we do that I want to give
[1:38:28] you a paragraph from the message
[1:38:30] questions and answers number two uh from
[1:38:34] Jeffersonville paragraph
[1:38:36] 110 and this will help you to understand
[1:38:40] what the anointing is we're still on the
[1:38:43] anointing we're going to be on the
[1:38:45] anointing in the morning and we're going
[1:38:47] to be on the anointing for for a few
[1:38:49] weeks now we're going to to emphasize
[1:38:52] the anointing oting well in order to do
[1:38:55] that we have to know what the anointing
[1:38:57] is rather we should know
[1:39:01] who who the anointing is you know we
[1:39:05] Pentecostals used to refer to the Holy
[1:39:07] Ghost as it but how many of you know the
[1:39:10] Holy Ghost is
[1:39:12] he he's a
[1:39:15] person somebody said well I thought he
[1:39:17] was a spirit he's a spirit when he
[1:39:20] manifested he manifested in the body of
[1:39:23] Our Lord in Jesus in him dwelt the
[1:39:27] fullness of the godhead bodily so it's
[1:39:31] not this Holy Ghost is not an inanimate
[1:39:33] object it's not the third person of a
[1:39:36] trinity no no it's the very thing that
[1:39:41] overshadowed
[1:39:43] Mary so we know that Jesus didn't have
[1:39:46] two
[1:39:46] fathers so we know that the father is
[1:39:49] the father and we know that the Holy
[1:39:52] Spirit over Ed Mary and she became
[1:39:55] pregnant expectant with the very word of
[1:39:58] God's seed that was planted in her and
[1:40:00] since Jesus doesn't have two fathers we
[1:40:03] understand that the eternal spirit of
[1:40:05] the father is the Same Spirit help me
[1:40:09] preach a little bit The Same Spirit as
[1:40:11] the Holy Ghost we're finding out that
[1:40:14] many who are coming out of the Amish
[1:40:16] community and many who are coming out of
[1:40:19] even out of the minite community into
[1:40:22] something a little little little juicier
[1:40:24] than that are struggling with the
[1:40:28] godhead you see they're struggling with
[1:40:31] the godhead because they've got him as
[1:40:33] three different people but how many of
[1:40:35] you know he's not three different people
[1:40:38] hero Israel the Lord is one and if you
[1:40:41] want to summarize for someone just give
[1:40:43] them this summary Jehovah of the Old
[1:40:46] Testament is Jesus of the new he is God
[1:40:51] I'm telling you that is the gospel
[1:40:54] and if there's any other gospel being
[1:40:56] preached than that one it's not the
[1:40:59] gospel amen the whole book is about this
[1:41:02] revelation of who Jesus is he's God not
[1:41:08] just a Son of God he's God hallelujah
[1:41:12] and guess what he loved you enough that
[1:41:15] he revealed himself to you and then he
[1:41:18] filled you with
[1:41:21] himself oh
[1:41:23] my this is not a feeling we have this is
[1:41:27] a spirit of almighty God that has been
[1:41:31] poured out upon this little New
[1:41:33] Testament bride this little Omega
[1:41:37] bride he had an alpha bride he's getting
[1:41:40] his Omega bride together now is't that
[1:41:44] great I in the message that we mentioned
[1:41:47] just a moment ago paragraph 110 the
[1:41:50] prophet says now this logos
[1:41:53] that was in him which was the spirit of
[1:41:58] God the
[1:42:01] anointing you hear that so we can say
[1:42:05] tonight the anointing is the spirit of
[1:42:08] God and the spirit of God is the logos
[1:42:12] so therefore the anointing is also the
[1:42:17] logos so did you know that the logos is
[1:42:20] now living inside of you it once stepped
[1:42:24] out of that great Fountain of Light and
[1:42:28] now that very same eternal spirit of God
[1:42:32] is living inside of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:35] filled believer so the anointing is not
[1:42:38] a
[1:42:39] feeling it's not doing something well
[1:42:43] and someone saying that sure was
[1:42:45] anointed it's not how well you do it
[1:42:48] that makes it anointed it's whether or
[1:42:51] not the spirit of God has sh up has the
[1:42:54] logos come among us tonight he certainly
[1:42:58] has because I brought him with me when I
[1:43:01] came how many of you brought the Loos
[1:43:04] with you you brought the spirit of God
[1:43:06] with you you brought the anointing with
[1:43:09] you and because of the
[1:43:12] anointing because of the anointing the
[1:43:17] yoke is
[1:43:18] destroyed I'm going to need you to work
[1:43:21] on this monitor please something is not
[1:43:23] not quite right I'm not hearing enough
[1:43:25] in the
[1:43:26] monitor now he said I love the way he
[1:43:29] said this he said now this logos that
[1:43:32] was in him which was the spirit of God
[1:43:36] the anointing through the sanctifying
[1:43:40] grace of the blood oh my
[1:43:46] brought are you here brought what many
[1:43:51] many sons
[1:43:53] of which I am one anybody identify any
[1:43:58] of you sisters
[1:44:00] identify oh what's wrong with that crowd
[1:44:03] that even the sisters identify as sons
[1:44:06] of God nothing wrong with us we have a
[1:44:10] revelation that if a man can be a part
[1:44:12] of the bride of
[1:44:14] Christ if I can be his bride you sisters
[1:44:18] can be his
[1:44:19] sons well it's by revelation that we see
[1:44:23] it through the sanctifying grace of the
[1:44:26] blood brought many sons to God which is
[1:44:31] Anointed or which are anointed with the
[1:44:36] same same
[1:44:38] logos he's in me he's in me Hallelujah
[1:44:43] he's in me he said now on the day of
[1:44:45] Pentecost it come down that Pillar of
[1:44:47] Fire broke apart like that tongues of
[1:44:49] fire set upon each of them not their
[1:44:52] tongues but tongues of fire set upon
[1:44:55] each of them a elected selected group
[1:44:59] identified by this Pillar of Fire
[1:45:02] showing that God had separated himself
[1:45:06] into man now remember they were there
[1:45:09] for one of the pilgrim Feast they were
[1:45:11] there for chavot and there were tens of
[1:45:14] thousands of people gathered in
[1:45:17] Jerusalem that day to celebrate the
[1:45:20] Feast of chavot we now refer to it as
[1:45:24] Pentecost because of the 50th and there
[1:45:28] were tens of thousands some some
[1:45:30] Scholars say hundreds of thousands of
[1:45:33] people because every male over the age
[1:45:36] of of about 30 was commanded to come it
[1:45:41] wasn't an option for him it was a
[1:45:43] commandment to be there so we don't know
[1:45:45] exactly how many either tens of
[1:45:47] thousands or could possibly be several
[1:45:51] hundred thousand people and And yet when
[1:45:53] the Holy Ghost decided to come when the
[1:45:56] logos came when the pillar of fire came
[1:46:00] when the anointing came that day it
[1:46:03] didn't fall originally on tens of
[1:46:06] thousands or hundreds of thousands of
[1:46:08] people but he discerned and found
[1:46:12] 120 a select group an elected group a
[1:46:17] predestinated pre-chosen group with a
[1:46:21] prefixed destiny and he fell on them and
[1:46:24] they became fire
[1:46:26] starters they just spread the fire
[1:46:30] Hallelujah they came out of that they
[1:46:33] stumbled they they staggered out of that
[1:46:37] place under the influence under the
[1:46:41] inspiration under a stimulation that
[1:46:44] comes from Revelation and it spilled out
[1:46:49] and and and 3,000 people came and and
[1:46:52] then another several thousand and
[1:46:54] another and the next thing you know it's
[1:46:56] still
[1:46:58] spreading Hallelujah and there's a group
[1:47:01] of people in this little place tonight
[1:47:03] that have tasted some of that original
[1:47:06] mana and have experienced some of that
[1:47:09] original Pillar of Fire that original
[1:47:14] logos that original
[1:47:16] anointing not a
[1:47:19] substitute but the
[1:47:21] original the real
[1:47:23] one he said did you get it God the
[1:47:27] logos separating himself into man God
[1:47:31] not in one person he's in his church
[1:47:36] Universal he goes on to say God was
[1:47:39] bottled and confined in one man Jesus
[1:47:43] Christ but now he's bottled and confined
[1:47:47] in the whole Universal Church of the
[1:47:50] Living God that's many sons somebody say
[1:47:52] it again many sons not just one son unto
[1:47:56] Glory but many
[1:47:59] sons so when God was speaking to my
[1:48:01] heart concerning this new year of
[1:48:05] 2024 he said it's going to be a year for
[1:48:08] mountain climbing oh I like that I
[1:48:12] believe there's higher Heights I believe
[1:48:15] there's deeper depths I believe if
[1:48:17] there's a deep calling there has to be a
[1:48:19] deep to respond I believe we get spoiled
[1:48:23] on it sometime we we get used to it
[1:48:26] sometime it becomes casual to us
[1:48:29] sometime but I believe that that there
[1:48:32] is a hunger that's deep within the heart
[1:48:35] of this little bride for more of him and
[1:48:40] if you're hungry for more of God it
[1:48:43] means there's more of God for you to
[1:48:46] have for you to encounter for you to
[1:48:50] personally experience in your life
[1:48:53] it's not
[1:48:55] religion it's not church anity it's a
[1:48:59] personal Born Again encounter with the
[1:49:03] Living God Jesus Christ the same
[1:49:08] yesterday and today and what forever and
[1:49:13] forever bless his name bless his name he
[1:49:16] said this is going to be a year for
[1:49:18] mountain climbing I like that because
[1:49:21] that's like God's saying to me I'm not
[1:49:23] going to leave you where you
[1:49:25] are I'm going to let you come up how
[1:49:28] many of you have read Revelation chapter
[1:49:30] 4 you know that's the Rapture
[1:49:33] invitation and how many of you
[1:49:35] understand by Revelation that the
[1:49:37] Rapture is not just a one-time twinkling
[1:49:39] of the eye but the Rapture is a
[1:49:42] revelation that catches us up into the
[1:49:45] fullness of Jesus Christ and so we don't
[1:49:48] have to say one day there's going to be
[1:49:51] a rapture we can say even now even now a
[1:49:55] Rapture is in
[1:49:57] progress that's right even now a Rapture
[1:50:01] is in progress because we're being
[1:50:03] raised up we're being snatched higher to
[1:50:08] sit with him together in Heavenly places
[1:50:12] God's saying to his little bride I don't
[1:50:14] want to leave you where you are I'm
[1:50:16] beckoning to you I'm calling to you I
[1:50:19] don't want you to become
[1:50:21] stagnant remember he said I would that
[1:50:24] thou W either hot or
[1:50:26] cold but but it's the lukewarm that
[1:50:29] sickens God he he's sickened by the fact
[1:50:32] that we so easily become lukewarm
[1:50:35] neither hot or neither cold for any of
[1:50:39] you that have ever worked in the field I
[1:50:40] remember as a boy those jugs of water
[1:50:44] how hot they would get as the sun was up
[1:50:47] it would be time in the afternoon to
[1:50:49] take a swig it wasn't nearly as
[1:50:52] refreshing ing in the afternoon as it
[1:50:54] was in the morning because the sun had
[1:50:57] changed the temperature of the water it
[1:51:00] wasn't cold any longer it wasn't exactly
[1:51:03] hot any longer it was now lukewarm and
[1:51:06] God said I can tolerate coldness and I
[1:51:09] can tolerate hotness but lukewarm turns
[1:51:13] my stomach and the lukewarm I will spew
[1:51:16] out of my mouth there's a modern Church
[1:51:19] world that's being expelled in this
[1:51:23] from the mouth of God but there's a
[1:51:25] little bride oh
[1:51:30] yes she's not going anywhere except
[1:51:34] up
[1:51:36] Hallelujah she wants more more Lord more
[1:51:41] Lord in
[1:51:43] 2024 we want more Lord more of your word
[1:51:48] more of your power more revelation
[1:51:53] of who you are we're we're so thankful
[1:51:56] for what we have and yet something in US
[1:51:58] says I I I want
[1:52:01] more so I said in this Visionary
[1:52:06] experience I said Lord how will we climb
[1:52:09] higher what would be what would be
[1:52:12] something that would help us to make
[1:52:15] sure that we don't miss this invitation
[1:52:18] to come up higher we're not just
[1:52:21] climbing any mountain Mountain we're
[1:52:23] climbing Zion Oh hear me now Zion is not
[1:52:28] just a place outside of Jerusalem in the
[1:52:31] Middle East but Zion is also a
[1:52:34] people and we're a Zion company do you
[1:52:38] understand prepared for such an hour as
[1:52:41] this and how is it that we're going to
[1:52:43] keep moving higher and I heard that that
[1:52:46] same voice that has spoken into my life
[1:52:49] so many times I heard that voice say be
[1:52:53] very
[1:52:57] surefooted be very
[1:53:00] surefooted you see the enemy would like
[1:53:02] to turn this climb into a slippery
[1:53:06] slope on he'd like for you and I to make
[1:53:09] a few little little progress you know
[1:53:12] climb a little uh an inch or two he'd
[1:53:14] like to swipe us right back down how
[1:53:17] many of you have ever had that as part
[1:53:19] of your experience feels like you get
[1:53:21] too close too step closer and something
[1:53:24] drags you back and you can never make
[1:53:27] any progress when you're going two steps
[1:53:29] ahead and one or two or three or four or
[1:53:31] five steps back and so I heard him say
[1:53:35] be very surefooted you've got to know
[1:53:37] where you're putting your
[1:53:39] foot you've got to make sure you're
[1:53:42] getting a
[1:53:43] grip and you're not going to climb the
[1:53:46] hill of Zion with
[1:53:50] flipflops oh I know you think I'm going
[1:53:52] to preach Holiness and you need some of
[1:54:00] it you know I came from that kind of
[1:54:02] Holiness where women didn't show their
[1:54:06] feet I came from that but I'm not
[1:54:09] talking about that tonight I'll save
[1:54:11] that for another time when just the
[1:54:13] locals are
[1:54:15] here you you know what a flipflop will
[1:54:18] do i' I've had on a pair I think feet
[1:54:20] are
[1:54:21] ugly and I don't know why anybody want
[1:54:23] to show their old hairy
[1:54:25] feet like a monkey I I don't get it but
[1:54:29] I've been in situations before where I
[1:54:32] where I was maybe going to take a shower
[1:54:34] in a foreign country or something I was
[1:54:36] glad to have something to protect my
[1:54:39] feet on and uh but you know they get so
[1:54:43] slippery those things and and you you
[1:54:46] slide right out and if they're if
[1:54:48] they're Old Navy
[1:54:51] 299 you'll just oh some of you know what
[1:54:55] I'm talking about if they're Old Navy
[1:54:58] 299 flipper floppers you'll just slide
[1:55:01] right out you'll just destroy them in
[1:55:04] one in one wet visit Oh no you're not
[1:55:07] going to climb this Mount Zion with
[1:55:10] flipflops
[1:55:12] on I ought to just go ahead and say it
[1:55:15] while I feel the unction you're not
[1:55:16] going to climb it with high heels
[1:55:19] [Music]
[1:55:21] on
[1:55:25] you you're going to have to get you
[1:55:26] something with some Traction in it
[1:55:30] you're going to have to be surefooted
[1:55:32] when you climb this
[1:55:34] mountain oh because the the gravels can
[1:55:38] can flow down and the rocks can shift
[1:55:41] and and it can get very precarious at
[1:55:44] times when you're climbing mountains yes
[1:55:47] sir oh I remember a time some of the the
[1:55:52] saints were just at Louisiana camp and
[1:55:56] there is a brother playing the violin on
[1:55:59] the stage there brother Hall he's uh uh
[1:56:03] I knew his dad brother Frank Hall in the
[1:56:06] UK and he's related to Mary Beth uh
[1:56:10] married to her niece is that right so
[1:56:14] nephew-in-law he's playing the violin I
[1:56:18] remember meeting him uh in the states
[1:56:21] for the first time
[1:56:22] in Sabino Canyon and we had climbed up
[1:56:25] in the canyon and he was part of the
[1:56:28] group and they decided they were going
[1:56:30] to run
[1:56:33] out I decided I was going
[1:56:37] to very carefully get out but these
[1:56:41] young whipper snappers my boys included
[1:56:44] they decided they were going to run out
[1:56:46] can you imagine all those little rocks
[1:56:50] and I mean I'm just walking walking at a
[1:56:52] regular pace and you step on the wrong
[1:56:54] place and your foot slides and you can
[1:56:57] twist your ankle and all kinds of things
[1:57:00] can happen but they decided they were
[1:57:01] going to run out and they did they ran
[1:57:03] all the way out of the canyon all the
[1:57:06] way out maybe did you did you go all the
[1:57:09] way to the to the visitor center there
[1:57:11] ran all the way out I'm waiting on the
[1:57:13] tram
[1:57:16] myself I'm climbing down I remember we
[1:57:19] come down a a a a path that I wasn't
[1:57:21] wasn't very familiar with and I was
[1:57:24] holding on for everything I had to get
[1:57:25] down and but here they go listen let me
[1:57:28] tell you something you you better not
[1:57:30] let your youth get to too far ahead of
[1:57:33] you here you you may think you're
[1:57:35] capable of running up this mountain but
[1:57:38] I want you to know there's 10, thousands
[1:57:41] upon 10, thousands of demon spirits that
[1:57:44] have been loose not against the church
[1:57:46] world not against the World At Large but
[1:57:49] the prophet said they've been loosed
[1:57:51] against the Bride of Jesus Christ did
[1:57:55] you know all hell is against you little
[1:57:57] bride did you know 10 thousands of
[1:58:00] thousands of demons are against you
[1:58:03] little bride you'll never run right up
[1:58:06] Mount Zion you'll have to climb it one
[1:58:08] step at a time one virtue at a time one
[1:58:12] birth at a
[1:58:14] time and you'll have to be surefooted
[1:58:17] right you'll have to stop sometime
[1:58:19] you'll feel like I'm not making much
[1:58:21] progress you'll feel like I must be
[1:58:23] wasting time but let me tell you there
[1:58:25] are seasons of
[1:58:27] speed and there are seasons of precision
[1:58:32] where we have to be very careful where
[1:58:33] we put our feet is anybody with us are
[1:58:37] you with me tonight are you just trying
[1:58:39] to rush me so you can get to lasagna or
[1:58:42] are you with me tonight and so I said
[1:58:45] how are we going to remain surefooted I
[1:58:48] I mean I've learned from these
[1:58:50] experiences you want to get get as much
[1:58:52] information out out of an experience as
[1:58:55] you possibly can so I said how will we
[1:58:59] do it how will we remain
[1:59:04] surefooted what kind of advice can I get
[1:59:08] so that I can remain surefooted and let
[1:59:12] this be a year of spiritual mountain
[1:59:16] climbing and I heard five voices one one
[1:59:19] right after another and I re recognized
[1:59:22] each of those voices and for the last
[1:59:25] couple of months I've been preaching on
[1:59:28] those instructions that were given some
[1:59:32] of you have heard it in the archive and
[1:59:34] you're familiar with it but there may be
[1:59:36] someone streaming or someone visiting
[1:59:39] tonight who hasn't heard the so very
[1:59:42] very quickly let me give you the five
[1:59:45] things number one I heard the voice of
[1:59:49] brother Perry green my friend
[1:59:52] and the founder and Pastor for 50 years
[1:59:57] of the Tucson
[1:59:59] Tabernacle a a real a real voice in my
[2:00:02] life a real constant uh a spiritual dad
[2:00:06] figure in my life and his voice the way
[2:00:10] he ex said certain
[2:00:13] phrases he never said the word he was a
[2:00:16] smart man but he never said
[2:00:20] specific I doubt he ever said it in his
[2:00:23] life he always said
[2:00:28] Pacific he meant specific but he'd
[2:00:31] always say pafic or
[2:00:34] Pacific and so his voice was so familiar
[2:00:38] to me and I've heard him say this phrase
[2:00:41] and you've heard it in his testimony and
[2:00:44] you've read it in his testimony book I
[2:00:47] heard brother green say whatever you
[2:00:50] do keep keep your balance in the
[2:00:55] scriptures you want to remain surefooted
[2:00:58] church then we must keep our balance in
[2:01:03] the scripture we can't go too far off
[2:01:06] into a tangent on any
[2:01:11] Doctrine we've got to bring everything
[2:01:13] he said back to the
[2:01:16] Bible and if it doesn't fit right in or
[2:01:19] you can't see how it fits you just leave
[2:01:22] it where it
[2:01:23] is if there's something for you to
[2:01:26] understand God will reveal it to you but
[2:01:29] you stay right in the
[2:01:32] scripture because this is the absolute
[2:01:35] now there are many people who will tell
[2:01:37] you that the tapes are the absolute and
[2:01:39] the books are the absolute I'm not one
[2:01:42] of those
[2:01:45] people you going to get
[2:01:48] quiet because I know what man touches
[2:01:52] what man
[2:01:53] manipulates you see 30 years ago we had
[2:01:56] a prophecy come out in this little
[2:01:58] church and God said much truth is laying
[2:02:04] on the floor of an editing room in
[2:02:10] headquarters now I'm just telling you
[2:02:12] what the Lord said and so if if that's
[2:02:16] what God thought about this that man had
[2:02:19] somehow perhaps at time
[2:02:22] had his hand in it then I can't call
[2:02:25] that an absolute somebody said what
[2:02:28] about the Bible the Bible is a
[2:02:30] Vindicated word it is brother bram's
[2:02:33] quotebook he called it the absolute he
[2:02:36] said everything's got to stand on that
[2:02:39] if it doesn't stand on that and Dove
[2:02:41] tail with that you leave it
[2:02:43] alone so I'm going to stay with that
[2:02:46] advice then the second voice I heard was
[2:02:49] actually the voice of brother brandom
[2:02:52] very familiar whatever you do remember
[2:02:55] stay in the middle of the
[2:03:00] road in Pentecost we we talked about a
[2:03:04] Highway of
[2:03:05] Holiness but the Bible doesn't talk
[2:03:08] about a Highway of Holiness the Bible
[2:03:10] talks about a
[2:03:12] highway and a
[2:03:15] way a highway and a way and the way
[2:03:20] shall be what
[2:03:22] the way shall be called the way of
[2:03:24] Holiness no fool or unclean thing will
[2:03:27] will Heir there accidentally get on that
[2:03:30] trail it's ordained of God for
[2:03:33] predestinated feet to walk on our
[2:03:37] understanding of that in church anity
[2:03:39] was that there was a highway there and
[2:03:42] off to the side there was a way the way
[2:03:46] of Holiness but that's not how God
[2:03:48] revealed it to brother brandham he said
[2:03:49] the way of Holiness sits right right in
[2:03:52] the middle of the
[2:03:54] highway it's not two different roads
[2:03:57] it's one road running right down the
[2:03:59] middle of the highway he said stay
[2:04:03] whatever you do stay in the middle of
[2:04:06] the road there's a lot of pressure that
[2:04:08] we feel sometime as Believers to get a
[2:04:11] little off
[2:04:13] balance even in Holiness sometime we get
[2:04:16] a little off balance we become a little
[2:04:19] legalistic we try to put a uniform on
[2:04:22] the truth you can wear the uniform and
[2:04:25] be
[2:04:27] lost so we've got to preach Holiness
[2:04:30] we've got to preach modesty we've got to
[2:04:32] preach separation from this world but
[2:04:35] we've got to stay in the middle of the
[2:04:38] road we've got to stay in the balance of
[2:04:41] the scripture because that's how we are
[2:04:43] going to remain
[2:04:44] surefooted as we climb this mountain not
[2:04:48] only 2024 but but for however long we
[2:04:51] have to climb
[2:04:52] I don't ever want to dip back down to
[2:04:54] where I was come on now somebody said
[2:04:57] back to where we were no no no no no oh
[2:05:01] no I want to go higher than I've ever
[2:05:03] been farther than I've ever
[2:05:06] been and then ver then number three I
[2:05:09] heard a woman's voice I know that shocks
[2:05:11] some
[2:05:12] people there are certain things that
[2:05:14] differentiate between a man or a woman I
[2:05:17] understand that brother brandom said a
[2:05:20] woman has every right to every spiritual
[2:05:23] gift he based it right on the word a
[2:05:26] woman has every right let me say it
[2:05:29] again in case some of you have been
[2:05:31] misinformed a woman has every right to
[2:05:35] every spiritual gift except handling the
[2:05:42] word so she can give message in tongues
[2:05:46] she can give
[2:05:47] interpretation she can have word of
[2:05:49] knowledge I know there's some who
[2:05:51] believes all that's over with that's why
[2:05:53] their churches in the shape it's
[2:05:55] in come on but we know he's still
[2:06:00] talking how many of you are glad you
[2:06:02] don't serve a God who quit talking in
[2:06:05] 1963 or
[2:06:07] 65 he's still talking to his bride how
[2:06:11] is he do it right out of the word right
[2:06:13] out of the message of Truth woman has
[2:06:15] every right to every spiritual gift
[2:06:17] except handling the word so women can
[2:06:20] bring inspirational truth to us a
[2:06:22] message you know when I say that I mean
[2:06:24] under the unction of the holy spirit so
[2:06:27] I heard a precious voice very familiar
[2:06:30] to me that of sister Ruth Hein some of
[2:06:33] you know who she was in the earth and
[2:06:37] she said this whatever you do remember
[2:06:41] praise until the spirit of worship comes
[2:06:45] worship until the glory comes and then
[2:06:49] stand in the glory
[2:06:52] oh if we could only begin to understand
[2:06:55] that there there's a there's an ultimate
[2:06:57] place that we want to get to when we
[2:06:59] praise there's a place that we want to
[2:07:01] get to when we worship we want to come
[2:07:04] right into the bosom of God we want to
[2:07:06] come right into the heart of God come on
[2:07:08] we want to feel his heartbeat and know
[2:07:11] exactly what it is that he would desire
[2:07:14] to say to us and praise is our way in I
[2:07:17] will enter his gates with Thanksgiving
[2:07:21] in my heart I will enter his courts with
[2:07:24] what with
[2:07:26] praise praise is is not just an offering
[2:07:30] that we give to him but praise becomes a
[2:07:34] weapon praise becomes a weapon we've
[2:07:37] seen Darkness beat back we've seen
[2:07:40] disease cast out we've seen depression
[2:07:44] have to go not only because of the
[2:07:47] preaching of the word or the anointing
[2:07:49] of oil or the laying on of hand
[2:07:51] but we've seen praise and worship create
[2:07:55] such an
[2:08:01] atmosphere you know this was the new
[2:08:03] ministry he talked about one that we
[2:08:06] wouldn't have to do prayer lines and the
[2:08:09] preacher wouldn't have to lose his
[2:08:11] strength and it wouldn't be him dragging
[2:08:13] out of here with no virtue but the word
[2:08:16] our praise our worship and the going
[2:08:18] forth of the anointed word would create
[2:08:22] such an atmosphere that the people's
[2:08:25] Faith would reach up and take a hold of
[2:08:27] God their disease would leave them their
[2:08:30] anxiety would
[2:08:33] leave their nervousness their depression
[2:08:36] their oppression would leave them their
[2:08:38] panic attacks would leave
[2:08:41] them just in that
[2:08:43] atmosphere so I believe I was being
[2:08:46] reminded that uh keeping balance in the
[2:08:49] scripture is important staying in the
[2:08:51] middle of the road is important and
[2:08:53] praise and worship is going to be
[2:08:54] important to make sure that our feet re
[2:08:57] remain very surefooted in times like
[2:09:00] these and then number four was the voice
[2:09:04] of a man who I happened to meet he was
[2:09:09] considered out there in the church World
[2:09:11] a prophetic person and I experienced
[2:09:14] some of the gift that was in his life
[2:09:17] and I appreciated him for who he was and
[2:09:21] I would
[2:09:21] I also appreciated his respect the
[2:09:24] respect that he showed toward brother
[2:09:26] brandom and his ministry although he was
[2:09:29] not a a a a full-fledged believer in
[2:09:32] this truth but I appreciated the fact
[2:09:35] that he could could say positive things
[2:09:38] when so many were saying such negative
[2:09:40] things and he was one who had this
[2:09:44] experience that he is standing before
[2:09:47] God he has a death experience and he
[2:09:50] sees
[2:09:51] uh several people we've we went through
[2:09:53] it if you've heard the series you've I
[2:09:56] don't have to repeat it all for you but
[2:09:58] the one person that I will mention is he
[2:10:00] saw a woman standing in line that was
[2:10:03] about to go in and inherit
[2:10:05] eternity and he noticed that her hands
[2:10:09] were all twisted up before she went in
[2:10:13] and he heard the Lord ask her this
[2:10:16] question he didn't say to her little
[2:10:19] sister uh what prophit did did you
[2:10:22] follow he didn't ask her what church did
[2:10:25] you go
[2:10:26] to he didn't ask her how she was
[2:10:29] baptized he asked her one
[2:10:32] question did you learn to
[2:10:38] love did you learn to love and you know
[2:10:41] what she answered brother ellias she
[2:10:44] said only
[2:10:45] you Lord I only
[2:10:48] listen I only learn to love you my
[2:10:53] husband left me in
[2:10:55] divorce and I allowed that
[2:11:00] loss to fill me with such a
[2:11:04] bitterness that I was never able to
[2:11:07] learn to love your
[2:11:09] people but I learned to love you and in
[2:11:12] our religious
[2:11:14] mindset we would think that he said you
[2:11:17] know I'm banishing you from the kingdom
[2:11:20] but he said no he didn't say that he
[2:11:22] said you come in I'm going I'm I'm
[2:11:25] bringing you in why because you love the
[2:11:27] thing that matters the most but but Bob
[2:11:31] said uh she she had no reward the only
[2:11:35] reward that she had was eternal life and
[2:11:37] I don't know about you but that sounds
[2:11:38] pretty good sounds pretty good she had
[2:11:42] no Crown she had no trophy she had no no
[2:11:46] wall of rewards but she learned to love
[2:11:50] the Lord well you know I want everything
[2:11:52] that's
[2:11:55] mine I I I really believe that if we
[2:11:58] love the Lord in this message it's
[2:12:01] necessary it's not optional it's
[2:12:04] imperative that we learn to love each
[2:12:06] other
[2:12:08] hello oh and when you say God I want to
[2:12:11] love your people he'll test you he'll
[2:12:13] send the
[2:12:17] most just look
[2:12:20] around
[2:12:21] see what God will do yes sir he'll send
[2:12:24] the the strangest folks in the world
[2:12:27] around
[2:12:28] you and tell you to love them hello I
[2:12:32] know some of you can't even smile
[2:12:35] now go you've not maybe you've not been
[2:12:38] tested as I've been tested in learning
[2:12:40] to love people it's a lot easier to love
[2:12:43] people when you see them every other
[2:12:46] month on now when you see them every
[2:12:49] Sunday and every Tuesday sometime you
[2:12:51] know you know I'm a little too good and
[2:12:54] I'm not just talking about me I'm
[2:12:55] talking about you we when you're in a
[2:12:57] local assembly you learn each other you
[2:13:00] you you may struggle sometime but you
[2:13:02] you we've got to win this thing because
[2:13:06] love is the key and love is
[2:13:09] transformational and love is who he
[2:13:12] is hallelujah and I believe we can
[2:13:16] that's right and then number five I
[2:13:18] introduced it to you this Sunday as I
[2:13:20] was leaving
[2:13:21] I heard the voice of my dear
[2:13:23] granny my precious big mama that's what
[2:13:26] I called her she was a large woman you
[2:13:30] know the story some of you may not she'd
[2:13:33] given her life to the Lord she was
[2:13:37] filled with the baptism of the Holy
[2:13:38] Ghost in
[2:13:39] 1950 and she her her daughter my aunt an
[2:13:45] fell dead at her feet with rheumatic
[2:13:48] fever her mother my great grandmother
[2:13:51] mother Lizzy was the woman in the
[2:13:53] community who bathed and prepared the
[2:13:56] dead to be buried so she knew enough
[2:13:59] about what death was when my
[2:14:02] grandmother's daughter my aunt her only
[2:14:05] daughter dropped dead at her feet with
[2:14:08] rheumatic fever and when my
[2:14:10] great-grandmother Drew her up in her
[2:14:13] arms and said to her baby she's dead
[2:14:16] she's gone there's no heartbeat there's
[2:14:19] no breath my grand grandm mother who was
[2:14:22] not you know a longtime Christian she
[2:14:26] hadn't been too long giving her whole
[2:14:27] life to the Lord she said Lord I'll go
[2:14:30] where you want me to go I'll do what you
[2:14:32] want me to do I'll say what you want me
[2:14:35] to say if you'll just raise my baby up
[2:14:37] if you won't take my daughter I'll serve
[2:14:40] you the best way I can I'll do whatever
[2:14:42] you call me to do and the Lord heard
[2:14:44] that prayer whatever you want to think
[2:14:46] about it the Lord heard that prayer they
[2:14:49] they put that dead body of my aunt in
[2:14:53] the back seat of the car with my great
[2:14:55] grandmother holding on to her in the lap
[2:14:58] my grandmother's in the front seat
[2:14:59] they're driving all the way from from uh
[2:15:02] around clopton Kyle Highway 10 and in La
[2:15:07] L Alabama they're going to the hospital
[2:15:09] probably in Dothan and and it was uh
[2:15:12] quite a drive away and all the way she's
[2:15:15] praying Lord and just before they get to
[2:15:17] the hospital my great grandmother says
[2:15:20] oh
[2:15:21] and my grandmother said what is it Mama
[2:15:24] she said she's breathing darling she's
[2:15:27] [Music]
[2:15:31] breathing God did
[2:15:34] it he gave her many more years to live I
[2:15:37] just attended her funeral just a few
[2:15:39] years ago with my family she lived many
[2:15:42] more years well my grandmother didn't
[2:15:44] know how to keep that promise she didn't
[2:15:46] know what to do there was nobody to tell
[2:15:49] her she had a gift in her life of the
[2:15:52] word of knowledge and she would get
[2:15:55] words from the Lord about people's needs
[2:15:57] and their sicknesses and their problems
[2:15:59] and she would pray for them and they
[2:16:01] would come from everywhere well it
[2:16:03] somehow developed into a preaching
[2:16:05] Ministry and I don't mind to tell you
[2:16:07] she preached circles around some of
[2:16:09] these message preachers come on now I
[2:16:12] believe
[2:16:14] it come on now no don't hang up on
[2:16:18] me she give it everything she
[2:16:21] had and people came from everywhere to
[2:16:24] hear
[2:16:25] her and you heard the story and she went
[2:16:29] to the the the news reached
[2:16:32] Columbus to brother brandham was going
[2:16:35] to be in
[2:16:37] Birmingham and the Assemblies of God and
[2:16:40] that was the church that ordained her
[2:16:43] and the Assembly of God said don't go
[2:16:46] you can't go hear William brandham he's
[2:16:49] in false doct friend and you better not
[2:16:53] go let me tell you all those hundreds
[2:16:55] and thousands of people healed in
[2:16:58] Birmingham they didn't care one thing
[2:17:01] about his
[2:17:04] Doctrine they didn't care what he
[2:17:06] believed all they knew is that God was
[2:17:09] Healing The Sick and raising the dead
[2:17:13] and they needed help that's right and so
[2:17:15] my grandmother she began to ask around
[2:17:18] town who'll go with me who'll go with me
[2:17:20] well somebody go with me and nobody
[2:17:22] would go with her except one little
[2:17:24] woman whose name was Minnie Jackson she
[2:17:28] was so skinny that her back was sway
[2:17:30] like this
[2:17:32] skinny I mean hidebound just Skin and
[2:17:36] Bones brother Jackson was a big man like
[2:17:41] me be careful what you say right
[2:17:44] now I didn't need no real big amens in a
[2:17:47] time like
[2:17:48] that when I need them I'll ask for him
[2:17:51] no I'm kidding but anyway and so all the
[2:17:54] little children in the church would
[2:17:55] would talk about brother and sister
[2:17:57] Jackson and they'd say he must lock her
[2:18:00] up in the pantry and eat all the
[2:18:02] food cuz she is so skinny well she was
[2:18:06] an older woman by then she was in her
[2:18:09] 80s
[2:18:10] then late 70s probably then and my
[2:18:15] granny said sister Jackson will you go

[2:18:58] finally they got in and they had a
[2:19:00] service it was so powerful God did
[2:19:03] amazing things I believe the two sermons
[2:19:05] were a trial a court trial or a trial
[2:19:08] and spiritual
[2:19:11] Amnesia after that service they saw
[2:19:14] things they had never seen heard things
[2:19:16] they' never heard sister Jackson had a
[2:19:18] strange reaction she said I'm so
[2:19:22] homesick I've got to go home sister
[2:19:25] Shelly my grandmother said Oh Sister
[2:19:28] Jackson I can't take you home tonight
[2:19:30] she said we get to be here one more
[2:19:32] night we can't leave this Holy Ghost
[2:19:35] atmosphere sister Jackson said I'm just
[2:19:37] going to be miserable if you make me
[2:19:38] stay she said I enjoyed the service but
[2:19:41] she said I've got to go home and so they
[2:19:43] went all the way my grandmother drove 4
[2:19:46] hours from northern part of Birmingham

[2:20:06] middle of the night very
[2:20:11] smart very smart woman because she knew

[2:20:34] and that night brother Brandon was
[2:20:35] talking about uh uh uh Abram to
[2:20:41] Abraham and she was sitting there
[2:20:43] thinking
[2:20:45] H she began to count on her
[2:20:49] fingers Abraham ham a b r a h a m s
[2:20:53] letters b r a n h a m s letters she said
[2:20:58] oh my about that time brother vandom
[2:21:01] turned his back to the crowd and he went
[2:21:05] down a road that was pretty close to her
[2:21:08] and he began with his back to the crowd
[2:21:10] told the story of of how Sarah laughed
[2:21:14] and the and and they wouldn't have known
[2:21:16] that you know just went through this
[2:21:18] whole thing and he she said he called
[2:21:22] out
[2:21:23] names and doctors names and diseases and
[2:21:28] and Street of dresses and went down the
[2:21:31] hole and she said there was something so
[2:21:33] holy the atmosphere got so holy until
[2:21:37] you could feel the very presence of God
[2:21:39] in that room and she said I couldn't I
[2:21:41] couldn't make it fit my theology I
[2:21:44] wasn't sure what was going on I knew it
[2:21:47] was God but I didn't know how to
[2:21:48] describe it I made a a vow in my mind
[2:21:52] that I would never talk about it because
[2:21:54] I didn't want to say the wrong thing and
[2:21:57] blaspheme against it and so she said I
[2:22:00] got home and all the tapes that I had
[2:22:02] gotten the books that I'd gotten I
[2:22:04] packed them up in the my whole life she
[2:22:07] never mentioned the
[2:22:08] meeting she never mentioned brother
[2:22:11] brandom's name to me until I heard this
[2:22:14] message through someone that brother
[2:22:16] Dwayne Jackson knew well brother Gerald
[2:22:19] Cleveland
[2:22:21] and when I heard the message I wanted to
[2:22:23] come home and tell Big Mama about it and
[2:22:26] so I came home to tell her about it and
[2:22:29] I said you remember granny all those
[2:22:31] years ago when I was preaching that the
[2:22:34] spirit of Elijah would forun the second
[2:22:37] coming of Jesus Christ and you told me I
[2:22:40] might ought to you know tame that down a
[2:22:43] little bit she said oh yes I remember
[2:22:45] that I said well I was
[2:22:49] right I was
[2:22:52] right she said you were I said I was
[2:22:55] right the spirit of Elijah had to come a
[2:22:59] and and a forerunner had to come and a
[2:23:02] prophet had to introduce the second
[2:23:04] coming of Jesus Christ just like John
[2:23:07] the Baptist and Prophet introduced the
[2:23:10] first coming of Jesus Christ and I
[2:23:12] expected her to get all kinds of
[2:23:14] religious on me and she looked at me and
[2:23:17] she said his name wouldn't happen to be
[2:23:19] William Bram would
[2:23:22] [Music]
[2:23:24] well you could have blowed me over with
[2:23:26] a feather I said
[2:23:29] what you mean you knew that
[2:23:33] name and she said sent me up the ladder
[2:23:36] brought down the box with the books and
[2:23:38] the tapes in it told me the story that I
[2:23:41] just told you and I said well Granny if
[2:23:44] that's right then then he would have
[2:23:47] thus sayith the Lord he wouldn't be a
[2:23:50] perfect man but he would be a man
[2:23:52] greatly used of God and and and if he
[2:23:56] could give us something from the word
[2:23:58] we'd have to believe what he said if it
[2:24:01] was in the word wouldn't we she said yes
[2:24:05] we would I said well if he had thus
[2:24:07] sayth the Lord we'd have to believe that
[2:24:09] wouldn't we she said yes we would I said
[2:24:13] well granny brother brandham preached
[2:24:15] right out of that word that a woman has
[2:24:18] no place pastoring a church Church
[2:24:21] handling the word of God you say what
[2:24:24] church did she pastor this
[2:24:29] one not this
[2:24:32] building but this
[2:24:36] church I said then we would have to obey
[2:24:39] that as long as he could show us what
[2:24:40] was in the word she said well that's
[2:24:43] exactly right I never thought of it that
[2:24:45] way but that's exactly right and I said
[2:24:47] well granny brother brandom said it's
[2:24:49] not your place
[2:24:52] I had had this discussion with her
[2:24:54] several times through the years and
[2:24:56] she'd always said ain't no man going to
[2:24:58] tell
[2:25:02] me I watched my baby drop dead at my
[2:25:05] feet I told the Lord I'll go where you
[2:25:06] want me to go I'd had this you know kind
[2:25:09] of an
[2:25:10] argument 10 15 times I just finally
[2:25:13] realized I wasn't going to make any
[2:25:14] progress with her just let her do what
[2:25:16] she needed to do and and and hope that
[2:25:19] and pray that she'd be all right right
[2:25:20] with God no one could touch her life no
[2:25:23] one could touch the life she lived so I
[2:25:26] was going to let God judge her and deal
[2:25:28] with her but I just had the courage to
[2:25:30] come and tell her what had just happened
[2:25:32] to me and she dropped her head no
[2:25:34] argument no fighting no
[2:25:37] spitting no talking in tongues no
[2:25:39] rebuking
[2:25:40] me she just looked over there at me and
[2:25:43] she said you mean to tell me that I've
[2:25:46] preached all these years and pastored
[2:25:48] all these years and it wasn't even my
[2:25:51] responsibility I said that's exactly
[2:25:54] what I'm telling you Granny you did it
[2:25:56] you did it with a good heart and a good
[2:25:57] intention but it never was your
[2:26:00] responsibility to do it she said well
[2:26:01] I'll never do it
[2:26:04] again well I'll never do it again now to
[2:26:07] be able to have that kind of a
[2:26:10] testimony proved that she had a hold of
[2:26:13] something that was real and as brother
[2:26:16] brandham told us she was doing God a
[2:26:17] service without being in his will are
[2:26:20] you still with me I know you local
[2:26:23] people have heard that dozens and dozens
[2:26:25] of times but it's still the
[2:26:28] truth and so it wasn't so long after
[2:26:32] that that the Lord began to prepare our
[2:26:34] hearts to give her
[2:26:35] up I I won't tell all the details of how
[2:26:38] that happened but she was diagnosed with
[2:26:41] cancer
[2:26:42] and she she you know her her picture was
[2:26:46] on the front page of the
[2:26:48] newspaper because everyone who asked her
[2:26:51] she she also did income tax to raise
[2:26:55] more funds for the church for the work
[2:26:57] of the Lord and and she she uh kept
[2:27:01] doing that right up until the end and
[2:27:03] they would come in and they would know
[2:27:04] that she was sick and she would be
[2:27:06] coughing and she'd be going through a
[2:27:08] lot of trouble and they'd say sister
[2:27:10] Shelly how are you or Miss Shell how are
[2:27:12] you and she'd say I'm
[2:27:14] blessed so the newspaper come out and
[2:27:17] did an article and the headlines was I'm
[2:27:21] blessed amen she touched the whole city
[2:27:25] with her testimony I'm
[2:27:28] blessed I'm in his hands there's no
[2:27:30] better place to
[2:27:32] be than in his
[2:27:34] hands she had me to baptize her in the
[2:27:37] name of the Lord Jesus Christ never had
[2:27:40] the right baptism until then and it
[2:27:44] looked like she was you know maybe
[2:27:47] shrinking a little bit maybe maybe she
[2:27:49] was getting close closer to going and I
[2:27:51] was in South Carolina where I had heard
[2:27:54] the message and I come home to spend a
[2:27:56] few days with her and and that day she
[2:28:00] told me as I was sharing with you before
[2:28:02] I left she said I want to share with you
[2:28:05] a vision that the lord gave me and I I
[2:28:07] knew if God showed her something that I
[2:28:09] would benefit by listening to it and I
[2:28:12] sat on the bed and she began to tell me
[2:28:14] can I just read this to
[2:28:16] you she began to talk to me about a
[2:28:19] vision the Lord had given her she
[2:28:21] described seeing a large wheel something
[2:28:23] that reminded her of an Old Wagon Wheel
[2:28:26] in this wheel there were spokes that
[2:28:28] went out in different directions she
[2:28:30] said the spirit of the Lord would carry
[2:28:33] her out those Spokes and let her see the
[2:28:37] various conditions and Perils of the
[2:28:41] world she said she saw famine and War
[2:28:44] and
[2:28:45] earthquakes riots with fighting in the
[2:28:47] street perverted lifestyles
[2:28:50] unrighteous
[2:28:52] living she saw people dying from dreaded
[2:28:55] disease and
[2:28:57] afflictions such awful things she said
[2:29:00] some like I've never really seen
[2:29:02] before after traveling down each spoke
[2:29:06] she would become so weary and weakened
[2:29:08] from what she saw that even fear would
[2:29:11] begin to enter her heart and she
[2:29:14] describe feeling like she would not be
[2:29:16] able to stand it anymore she was
[2:29:18] thankful that she only had glimpses of
[2:29:21] those horrible things but every single
[2:29:24] time when she would feel nearly hopeless
[2:29:27] and
[2:29:28] overwhelmed the spirit of God she said
[2:29:30] would carry me back down the spoke to
[2:29:34] the hub of the
[2:29:35] wheel and at the Hub of the wheel was
[2:29:39] the
[2:29:40] anointing she would go on to say it was
[2:29:43] the pillar of fire it was the shikina
[2:29:45] glory it was the very anointed presence
[2:29:48] of Jesus Christ
[2:29:50] it was true in the hub she was
[2:29:53] overshadowed by his spirit and Glory
[2:29:56] everything she had needed was supplied
[2:29:59] in those few moments in the
[2:30:02] anointing the first time she arrived in
[2:30:05] the hub she told me that the Lord spoke
[2:30:07] to her and she dictated these words to
[2:30:10] me that day daughter this is my
[2:30:13] anointing you will find that no matter
[2:30:15] what is happening around you there will
[2:30:17] always be peace and strength in my
[2:30:22] anointing keep your mind on me and live
[2:30:26] in my anointing no matter what My bride
[2:30:29] is faced with she must remember my
[2:30:32] spirit my anointing will be available
[2:30:36] for her to reach out and take a hold of
[2:30:39] it after a bit she would be ushered down
[2:30:43] another spoke see glimpses of more more
[2:30:46] turmoil followed each time with a
[2:30:48] journey back to the hub
[2:30:50] back to the
[2:30:51] anointing she spoke other things to me
[2:30:54] that day very prophetic of what was to
[2:30:56] come in our church and Ministry but the
[2:30:59] one thing that I remember the
[2:31:02] clearest of all that she said to me that
[2:31:05] day is what her voice spoke in this
[2:31:08] experience as the fifth
[2:31:11] thing keep your balance stay in the
[2:31:15] middle of the road praise until the
[2:31:17] spirit of worship comes you must must
[2:31:20] learn to love and the last thing was my
[2:31:23] granny's voice and she said whatever you
[2:31:25] do remember son the
[2:31:29] anointing the
[2:31:31] anointing the
[2:31:33] anointing makes the difference didn't
[2:31:36] matter how black it was didn't matter
[2:31:38] how dark it was I want to tell you
[2:31:40] something tonight doesn't matter how
[2:31:43] rough it
[2:31:44] gets doesn't matter what 2024 holds or
[2:31:48] 2025
[2:31:50] doesn't matter how many eclipses there
[2:31:52] are how many planetary alignments there
[2:31:56] are doesn't matter how many more CO's
[2:31:59] there
[2:32:01] are the
[2:32:03] anointing the
[2:32:05] Loos the holy spirit of
[2:32:08] God oh come on it's the anointing that
[2:32:13] makes the
[2:32:15] difference it's
[2:32:17] him it's not a Feeling

[2:32:22] oil if you're doing something and God is
[2:32:25] not pouring his oil on it don't do it
[2:32:28] anymore it's the anointing that makes a
[2:32:34] difference I tell people I see little
[2:32:37] churches dwindling to
[2:32:39] nothing and if this church today was
[2:32:42] dwindling to nothing I would ask the
[2:32:45] Lord what's going
[2:32:47] on what must I do to have the anointing
[2:32:53] back because it's the anointing that
[2:32:56] makes a difference it's the anointing
[2:32:59] that causes the sick to have faith to be
[2:33:02] healed it's the anointing that drives
[2:33:05] anxiety out of the way and panic attacks
[2:33:07] it's the anointing that combats fear

[2:33:16] difference I want you to look I want to

[2:33:42] that day that his burden shall be taken
[2:33:46] from off thy shoulder and his yoke from

[2:33:52] phrase with me and the Yoke shall be

[2:35:22] time to do it again but we broke that
[2:35:25] down and we found out that if you were
[2:35:27] to boil that down to to its to its real
[2:35:34] meaning I I I I think I showed you the
[2:35:37] NIV let's do it you know I'm not an NIV

[2:35:58] I may not
[2:36:00] have but here's what it says and it
[2:36:03] helps you to capture the real meaning of
[2:36:05] the Yoke being destroyed in that day
[2:36:08] their burden will be lifted from your
[2:36:11] shoulders it's a burden of Assyria the
[2:36:14] burden shall be lifted from your
[2:36:16] shoulders their
[2:36:18] yoke from your
[2:36:20] neck and the Yoke will be
[2:36:27] broken come on skinny people say
[2:36:31] Amen brother God said I'm going to pour
[2:36:35] out my anointing on you you're not even
[2:36:39] going to realize that your
[2:36:45] neck did did you know how important your
[2:36:48] neck is amen your I'm not talking about
[2:36:52] your
[2:36:55] wife my wife is not my
[2:37:02] neck you know the little
[2:37:04] funny you know I yeah you're the head of
[2:37:07] the house but I'm the neck and I turn
[2:37:09] the head let me tell you something the
[2:37:13] husband is the head of the wife but the
[2:37:15] husband has a
[2:37:16] head how many of you know what
[2:37:18] Colossians talks about holding the head
[2:37:21] of
[2:37:22] Christ that head is the most important
[2:37:24] head that's the most important Authority
[2:37:26] more important than your pastor more
[2:37:28] important than your Apostle more
[2:37:30] important than your Prophet more
[2:37:32] important than your organization or your
[2:37:34] little denominational version of this
[2:37:36] message somebody ought to help me your
[2:37:40] head is Christ and if you've got a weak
[2:37:45] neck if your neck is weak you can't Pro
[2:37:49] properly support
[2:37:53] cooperate Embrace Hold On To The Head
[2:37:58] the enemy wants to weaken your
[2:38:02] neck he wants to squeeze out your
[2:38:06] anointing he wants to weary you with the
[2:38:09] Yoke of Assyria and Egypt and
[2:38:14] Babylon but this was the word of the
[2:38:16] Lord the Yoke oh my people is Israel the
[2:38:20] Yoke shall be lifted off of your neck
[2:38:24] and the Yoke will be broken because your
[2:38:30] neck has grown so
[2:38:33] fat that the Yoke that the enemy once
[2:38:36] used to drive you to control you to
[2:38:40] compel you will no longer be able to fit
[2:38:44] you anymore and the the anointing in
[2:38:47] your
[2:38:48] life
[2:38:52] don't we need the Holy Ghost baptism
[2:38:55] don't we need the Holy Ghost baptism
[2:38:58] don't we need the spirit of God in our
[2:39:00] midst don't we need a holy ghost
[2:39:04] [Applause]
[2:39:05] service because that's what strengthens
[2:39:08] the neck the neck is what holds on and
[2:39:10] supports the head yes sir and God said
[2:39:13] I'm going to pour such anointing on your
[2:39:15] life that your neck will grow so fat
[2:39:18] that that old Yol that the enemy has
[2:39:20] used come on to control you sir will no
[2:39:24] longer be able to control you anymore
[2:39:26] because it's not just going to be
[2:39:28] broken God's trying to tell somebody
[2:39:30] here tonight I'm not just going to break
[2:39:33] the thing so that the enemy can come
[2:39:35] along and glue it back together put it
[2:39:37] on your shoulder and control your life
[2:39:39] how many of you have ever been
[2:39:40] controlled by something have you ever
[2:39:42] been controlled by depression have you
[2:39:44] ever been controlled by gluttony have
[2:39:46] you ever been controlled by lust
[2:39:50] have you ever been controlled by
[2:39:52] nervousness depression oppression
[2:39:54] anxiety fear if you've ever been
[2:39:57] controlled by something you want out
[2:39:59] from under it and you don't ever want
[2:40:01] there to be any possibility or
[2:40:04] potential of that thing ever being used
[2:40:08] to control you to make you Subs servant
[2:40:12] again God said that's what I want to do
[2:40:15] for my people I don't want to just break
[2:40:16] the Yol and let the devil come along and
[2:40:19] put it back on I want to send such an
[2:40:22] anointing such an experience such an
[2:40:25] encounter with the Holy Ghost that that
[2:40:29] yoke will be split destroyed annihilated
[2:40:32] in so many different little tiny
[2:40:35] insignificant pieces that the enemy will
[2:40:37] never be able to use it against you
[2:40:39] again anybody hearing me is anybody
[2:40:42] finding a yoke in your life that you'd
[2:40:44] like to see the anointing come before we
[2:40:47] leave here this weekend huh
[2:40:51] anything you're dependent on other than
[2:40:53] Jesus Christ anything that can control
[2:40:56] your mood other than the truth of God's
[2:41:00] word oh that wooden beam a yoke a device
[2:41:04] used to govern and control
[2:41:07] directionally the promise of the Lord it
[2:41:09] goes on and on here here was another
[2:41:11] here's another
[2:41:13] commentary uh Kyle and delit commentary
[2:41:17] and this is how it handles verse 27 I
[2:41:19] love it the Yoke like the burden will be
[2:41:23] taken away from Israel that's who you
[2:41:25] are your spiritual Israel we know that
[2:41:28] by the word of God one new man he said
[2:41:31] that yoke
[2:41:33] itself will snap that's not big enough
[2:41:37] but it's a start it will snap from the
[2:41:40] pressure of his fat strong neck against
[2:41:45] it this commentary seems to indicate
[2:41:48] that God is is going to place his strong
[2:41:51] neck where your weak neck has been do
[2:41:55] you understand that's who he is he's the
[2:41:57] God who can do for us did you know the
[2:42:00] other meaning of el Shai it's not just
[2:42:03] the many breasted one how many of you
[2:42:06] know there's another meaning to the to
[2:42:08] the to the title elshadai and it means
[2:42:11] the god of utter ruin and
[2:42:13] destruction The God Who can do for
[2:42:18] you The God Who can do for you anybody
[2:42:21] with me the god that can do for you what
[2:42:25] you cannot do for
[2:42:28] yourself does anybody need God to do
[2:42:31] something for you that you've not been
[2:42:33] able to do for
[2:42:36] yourself he Delights in that he longs to
[2:42:40] be that God in your life amen he he
[2:42:45] longs to be that God in your life amen I
[2:42:49] want the musicians to
[2:42:51] come I didn't get very far I don't think
[2:42:55] it's going to matter in just a moment
[2:42:57] how far we got because I'm depending on
[2:43:01] the Lord to
[2:43:02] come I'm depending on the Lord to come
[2:43:05] and help us now you've been sitting a
[2:43:08] while would you like to stand and
[2:43:10] stretch just a moment we're going to
[2:43:14] someone said no they don't want to
[2:43:16] stretch was that Liam that didn't want
[2:43:18] to want to
[2:43:20] stretch okay Liam you don't have to
[2:43:22] stretch
[2:43:23] honey no you don't want to stand up and
[2:43:26] stretch I want to stretch I want to
[2:43:28] stand up a little bit I want you to
[2:43:31] think about anything and everything that
[2:43:34] the enemy has been using to keep you
[2:43:36] under his
[2:43:38] control this is not just
[2:43:42] figurative it can be quite
[2:43:44] literal the enemy can place something in
[2:43:47] your life that you're powerless
[2:43:50] against but there's a
[2:43:52] God who's bigger than any
[2:43:55] problem who's bigger than any situation
[2:43:58] who's bigger than any condition and he
[2:44:01] wants to show up and show out in your
[2:44:03] life right doesn't have to be some big
[2:44:06] Grand
[2:44:07] display it just has to be a surrender
[2:44:10] are you ready are you willing tonight to
[2:44:13] let him pour His oil on your life are
[2:44:16] you willing to come into the presence of
[2:44:18] his anointing for just another moment
[2:44:20] and let God burst that yoke from off of
[2:44:23] your and the Yoke and the Yoke and the
[2:44:26] Yoke shall be and the Yoke shall be
[2:44:29] destroyed
[2:44:31] amen destroyed that's right because of
[2:44:35] the
[2:44:37] anointing Lord
[2:44:39] Jesus here we are tonight just softly
[2:44:43] something here we are and we've seen
[2:44:47] your strength today
[2:44:50] we've seen your spirit
[2:44:52] today we saw you moving Even in our
[2:44:55] fellowship
[2:44:57] today you came and anointed our worship
[2:45:01] and you anointed these brothers to
[2:45:04] sing using the gift that you've given
[2:45:08] them to take us into a higher
[2:45:11] place and your word has come
[2:45:14] tonight to help us to be
[2:45:17] surefooted to help us to be the mountain
[2:45:21] climbers that you have elected us to
[2:45:25] be I can feel the nervousness of that
[2:45:28] old enemy who has tried so hard to
[2:45:32] distract
[2:45:35] you because he doesn't want
[2:45:38] to to flee from
[2:45:41] you I'm reminded of the scripture
[2:45:44] tonight resist the
[2:45:46] devil don't cooperate with him any
[2:45:48] longer longer make up your mind I'm
[2:45:50] going to resist him and the scripture
[2:45:53] says to a Believer he has no choice but
[2:45:55] to do what he has to flee from
[2:45:59] you I would dare say because of the
[2:46:02] anointing that's on your life the enemy
[2:46:05] has to flee from
[2:46:07] you he can't ride you if you if you if
[2:46:10] you'll take away the
[2:46:13] saddle if you'll make up your mind I'm
[2:46:16] not toing the devil another day and
[2:46:19] letting that
[2:46:20] yoke squeeze me oppress me and trouble
[2:46:25] me I'm going to find myself in the
[2:46:28] spirit of the Lord in the presence of
[2:46:30] the Lord every time I can I'm going to
[2:46:32] find myself praising the Lord and
[2:46:35] worshiping the Lord I'm going to find me
[2:46:37] an atmosphere to get in
[2:46:40] hello I'm going to find me an atmosphere
[2:46:43] to get in that's higher than what I'm in
[2:46:45] now I'm going to believe that God
[2:46:49] will so strengthen my
[2:46:51] neck that no yoke that the enemy would
[2:46:54] place on my
[2:46:55] shoulders is going to be successful in
[2:46:58] controlling my life hindering or
[2:47:00] harassing me any longer if you're here
[2:47:04] tonight and you know that the enemy has
[2:47:07] used a yoke you might even be able to
[2:47:09] name it it's not necessary but you might
[2:47:12] even be able to give it a name as you
[2:47:14] stand there right now if you're
[2:47:16] determined tonight to find your
[2:47:18] Deliverance in his presence I believe
[2:47:20] he's here to set you free maybe it's
[2:47:24] fear maybe it's fear that tries to
[2:47:27] control you maybe it is
[2:47:29] anxiety maybe it is
[2:47:32] depression being someone who suffered
[2:47:35] with it myself I certainly know what a
[2:47:37] roller coaster life can be until God
[2:47:40] comes and sets you free from that
[2:47:44] thing I told in
[2:47:47] Africa the test testimony of how that my
[2:47:51] great-grandfather and my grandfather and
[2:47:53] my father none of them were faithful to
[2:47:56] their wives they were driven and
[2:47:59] controlled by a yoke of lust and I gave
[2:48:02] my testimony One Night in Africa how is
[2:48:06] just a young boy not even quite a
[2:48:08] teenager that Spirit came and wanted to
[2:48:11] take control of my life and I Lay All
[2:48:14] Night Long at the foot of my bed crying
[2:48:17] out to God for deliverance from that
[2:48:19] Spirit of lust and he met me
[2:48:23] there he delivered me from that thing
[2:48:25] that it would not have control over my
[2:48:28] life and because of that I know that
[2:48:30] it's broken from me and it's broken from
[2:48:33] my
[2:48:34] children yes maybe you're suffering
[2:48:37] maybe you're dealing with something like
[2:48:38] that and you'd like to be free from it I

[3:28:07] until you know what you

[3:28:14] town there was a strug struggle in this

[3:28:17] tonight over what you
[3:28:20] believe until you decide what you
[3:28:24] believe the enemy will have that
[3:28:27] Advantage but when you make up your mind
[3:28:30] as some have that you know what God has
[3:28:33] revealed to you and nothing is going to
[3:28:35] move you off of it you've got all the
[3:28:37] authority you need then to beat the
[3:28:39] devil right back where he belongs you
[3:28:41] believe that does anybody believe that
[3:28:44] that's where our Authority lies it's
[3:28:47] Faith don't you let the enemy talk you
[3:28:50] out of what you
[3:28:52] believe if it's on that word if it fits
[3:28:55] that word if it's according to that word
[3:28:58] then it's right and God always uses his
[3:29:01] word to defeat his
[3:29:04] enemy he is
[3:29:07] defeated oh he is defeated
[3:29:14] tonight I've watch people leave a

[3:29:36] I didn't even
[3:29:38] know that it was
[3:29:40] gone because it's your faith it's
[3:29:43] according to your

[3:29:48] something's
[3:29:49] moving I know it's late I'm I I I
