[1:12:39] [Music]
[1:12:40] there's so many things to think about
[1:12:43] when we think about heaven
[1:12:47] I think the most amazing thing is going
[1:12:49] to be to look upon the face
[1:12:51] of our precious Lord
[1:12:53] who paid such a awful price that we
[1:12:57] would be redeemed back to God's original
[1:12:59] thoughts about us
[1:13:01] but I like most of you have been a
[1:13:04] victim of misunderstanding
[1:13:06] sometimes I misunderstood and sometimes
[1:13:10] I was misunderstood if I had to pick for
[1:13:14] myself the second most wonderful thing
[1:13:17] about heaven it would be verse two
[1:13:20] the fact that there will be no more
[1:13:22] misunderstanding
[1:13:23] we'll be won together
[1:13:25] no more Church fights
[1:13:29] no more shunning
[1:13:32] oh no we'll just be one together with
[1:13:35] him
[1:13:35] whoa give him praise
[1:13:38] [Music]

[1:13:45] where there is no
[1:13:48] misunderstanding
[1:13:52] thank you Lord
[1:13:54] and from all enmity
[1:13:59] and strife we're
[1:14:02] free will that be the day no one-time
[1:14:06] words no I'm kind words
[1:14:11] the heart are ever spoken

[1:14:24] means with the rest of you stand with us

[1:17:05] many people out of the Amish church and
[1:17:09] not only into into free salvation but

[1:17:50] don't know they're you know they stay
[1:17:52] close to home they're busy they've got
[1:17:53] the farm they've got everything and I
[1:17:55] said well we're going to pray
[1:17:57] we're going to pray
[1:17:59] and you know I thought well somewhere
[1:18:02] often that you you better know what
[1:18:03] you're doing when you pray
[1:18:06] God will surprise you and answer you
[1:18:09] he did it I I'm I'm taking that I'm
[1:18:12] taking that as a as a testimony
[1:18:15] uh I didn't know it would be this
[1:18:17] weekend but God answered prayer we've
[1:18:19] got to meet four of them and we're
[1:18:21] looking forward maybe to having an
[1:18:22] opportunity to meet more and you heard
[1:18:25] the testimony here how long ago was the
[1:18:27] baptism
[1:18:33] two months yeah yeah I know you you you
[1:18:36] just baptized some of these very
[1:18:38] recently didn't you they were just
[1:18:40] Baptist look at the back row back there
[1:18:42] these are recent baptized Brothers
[1:18:46] Hallelujah
[1:18:48] Hallelujah
[1:18:54] in Ohio that the baptism took place and
[1:18:57] how many were baptized that day
[1:18:59] 17.
[1:19:06] praise
[1:19:07] the Lord
[1:19:08] [Applause]
[1:19:10] uh
[1:19:12] somebody said does it matter how you're
[1:19:14] baptized are you kidding me
[1:19:17] [Music]
[1:19:19] you just asked their forefathers if it
[1:19:22] matters about baptism
[1:19:24] they only had us a portion of Revelation
[1:19:27] concerning baptism the anabaptist people
[1:19:30] only knew that infant baptism was not
[1:19:33] right and that sprinkling was not right
[1:19:36] some of them began to see that some of
[1:19:38] them
[1:19:39] they didn't know anything about baptism
[1:19:41] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so
[1:19:44] they died many many many died for a
[1:19:48] portion of the truth
[1:19:52] you and I ought to be careful how we
[1:19:54] handle the truth
[1:19:57] because people died for a portion of the
[1:20:00] truth
[1:20:01] we used to crack ice on the on the lake
[1:20:03] to baptize people in titles
[1:20:06] because we didn't know any better than
[1:20:08] that
[1:20:09] so we ought to be very thankful that God
[1:20:11] has revealed this true Christian baptism
[1:20:15] by immersion in the name of the Lord
[1:20:18] Jesus Christ
[1:20:22] in running water yeah
[1:20:26] yeah because no matter where we are we
[1:20:27] run it in and run it out
[1:20:31] they told me they said well you can't
[1:20:32] baptize people in the bathtub you can't
[1:20:34] baptize people in the cow trough you
[1:20:37] can't baptize people in a swimming pool
[1:20:38] I said you get out of my way
[1:20:41] I'll baptize them anywhere I can get
[1:20:43] enough water to dunk them
[1:20:46] when I when I turn on the fossil
[1:20:52] sound that's running water
[1:20:54] [Music]
[1:20:56] oh I need to preach
[1:20:59] but I'm having such a good time
[1:21:02] would you turn with me this evening
[1:21:06] to first Thessalonians chapter 4.
[1:21:09] and we have been there as a church body
[1:21:11] for a few weeks now
[1:21:13] and I'm going to have to do a a really
[1:21:17] quick review just a tad down on the
[1:21:21] monitor here I know you never hear me
[1:21:22] say that
[1:21:24] but just a tad do you know what a tad is
[1:21:29] I'm going to have to do just a little
[1:21:31] quick review for those who are have not
[1:21:33] been with us these last few weeks I
[1:21:35] asked the Lord for something catchy and
[1:21:38] I asked the Lord to give me a Revival
[1:21:40] style message and I I wanted to just do
[1:21:44] that when you all come to fellowship
[1:21:45] with us
[1:21:46] but the Lord just arrested me
[1:21:49] and uh this afternoon I thought I could
[1:21:52] wiggle out of it
[1:21:53] but he re he really arrested me
[1:21:57] and I think it's very very important for
[1:21:59] us to know where we are
[1:22:01] in this great economy of God
[1:22:04] and and I just I'm so thankful anyway
[1:22:08] first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 15
[1:22:11] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:22:15] the Lord
[1:22:17] that we which are alive and remain unto
[1:22:21] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:22:25] them which are asleep
[1:22:28] for the Lord himself not a prophet
[1:22:34] not a bishop
[1:22:36] not a pastor for the Lord himself shall
[1:22:41] descend from heaven with a shout
[1:22:45] a message
[1:22:47] to awaken the bride
[1:22:50] with the voice of the Archangel the
[1:22:54] chief Angel the voice of Jesus in a
[1:22:58] mini-membered bride
[1:23:00] and with the Trump the last Trump the
[1:23:03] final Trump of God and the dead in
[1:23:08] Christ shall rise first
[1:23:13] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:23:16] be caught up together with them in the
[1:23:18] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:23:22] so shall we ever be with the Lord
[1:23:28] let's pray together for just a few
[1:23:30] moments
[1:23:33] father we have come into this place
[1:23:37] tonight
[1:23:38] to exalt your name
[1:23:42] to worship you because you alone are
[1:23:46] worthy
[1:23:49] we have come to enter into your presence
[1:23:54] and therefore we welcome the angels
[1:23:58] we welcome the heavenly host in our
[1:24:02] midst
[1:24:03] as brother Branham would often call them
[1:24:05] to come and take up their position
[1:24:08] around the walls and on the ends of the
[1:24:11] pews we thank you that they have come
[1:24:13] because the redeemed of the Lord are
[1:24:16] here
[1:24:18] they are here because we are here
[1:24:21] and we give you the praise
[1:24:24] we have come now to a part of the
[1:24:26] service that brings change
[1:24:29] it's not our feeling it's not our
[1:24:32] worship it's not our enjoyment of the
[1:24:34] songs
[1:24:35] it's not a sensation or a feeling in our
[1:24:39] physical body that brings true change
[1:24:42] it's only your word
[1:24:45] and even your word can come as a dry
[1:24:49] letter unless the spirit comes and
[1:24:52] anoints us to hear that word
[1:24:56] we're not asking you to anoint your word
[1:24:59] your word is anointing your word is
[1:25:02] spirit life
[1:25:03] we're asking you to anoint the lips of
[1:25:07] your servant to bring it and we are
[1:25:09] asking that our ears would be anointed
[1:25:12] to hear it and that it would execute
[1:25:15] change in our lives
[1:25:18] now Lord many here are tired in physical
[1:25:20] body having worked today and some having
[1:25:24] traveled many miles to be here in this
[1:25:27] service tonight but we cannot afford to
[1:25:29] waste these moments that we have
[1:25:31] together
[1:25:32] so I ask you to help us to be alert
[1:25:35] I ask you to help us to pull upon the
[1:25:38] gift of God that you might come and
[1:25:40] answer questions in this room that you
[1:25:43] might come and speak directly to the
[1:25:46] needs of your people I pray Lord that
[1:25:49] you will help your people even now to
[1:25:51] use their pool of Faith their faith pool
[1:25:54] to pull the word of God in their
[1:25:57] direction that it might bring change
[1:25:59] that it might bring life that it might
[1:26:02] bring Direction
[1:26:04] Lord we are thankful to be living in the
[1:26:07] last of the last days
[1:26:08] we are thankful that you have preserved
[1:26:11] the remnant bride in this hour of great
[1:26:14] apostasy
[1:26:16] we thank you that you have reserved
[1:26:18] Truth for us and Truth is not a Doctrine
[1:26:21] but a person and you are that person and
[1:26:25] we thank you for who you are and what
[1:26:28] you have done in US and through us we
[1:26:32] thank you for authority over every demon
[1:26:35] power and we command every opposing and
[1:26:39] distracting Spirit to Bow right now to
[1:26:42] the authority of Jesus Christ The Living
[1:26:45] Word who walks among us tonight and
[1:26:49] we'll give you the glory and the honor
[1:26:51] and the praise for it's in the name of
[1:26:53] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the
[1:26:55] Saints said
[1:26:57] amen God bless you as you take your
[1:27:00] seats this evening
[1:27:02] we're talking about Rapture anointing
[1:27:06] we're talking about a faith for rapture
[1:27:11] you you can't catch Rapture Faith from a
[1:27:15] magnetic recording
[1:27:17] but you can hear truth
[1:27:20] on a recording that strikes your heart
[1:27:24] and causes an intellectual bit of
[1:27:28] information
[1:27:29] to drop down from your head to your
[1:27:32] heart and all the way down to your feet
[1:27:35] so that you can walk it out
[1:27:38] we don't have a problem in this bride of
[1:27:41] of uh of of a lack of the word
[1:27:45] we have the word we have heard the truth
[1:27:48] the truth has been stored for us and
[1:27:52] we're thankful for spiritual food in due
[1:27:54] season but I want you to know that if
[1:27:57] you're not careful you can become
[1:27:59] educated
[1:28:00] and you can even become an educated fool
[1:28:05] so smart you don't know how to apply
[1:28:08] anything you know
[1:28:09] and it takes a revelation for this word
[1:28:13] you know the the problem is is about 12
[1:28:16] inches or 18 inches long
[1:28:18] it's about the distance from here to
[1:28:21] here if we can get it out of our heads
[1:28:23] and into our heart then it can go to our
[1:28:26] hands and our feet and we can live it
[1:28:28] before a world that's dying and going to
[1:28:31] hell a world that needs Jesus with skin
[1:28:34] on him I want you to know the reason why
[1:28:37] a remnant bride has been called out is
[1:28:40] so that Jesus can have skin again on
[1:28:44] this Earth
[1:28:46] and we may see one another's flaws and
[1:28:49] we may see one another's warrants and we
[1:28:52] may see one another's pimples but I want
[1:28:55] you to know there's a way to look at
[1:28:56] each other where we're seeing Christ in
[1:28:59] each other and what the Living Word is
[1:29:02] producing in lives in this room tonight
[1:29:06] is worth celebrating what God is doing
[1:29:09] Among Us and among his people around the
[1:29:13] world is worth celebrating the word is
[1:29:16] becoming flesh again you understand this
[1:29:19] was what the message came to do not only
[1:29:23] in brother branham's flesh
[1:29:27] but in your flesh
[1:29:29] and in my flesh
[1:29:31] so what do we do we cry out for it we
[1:29:34] position ourselves to receive it we come
[1:29:38] out of dead dry formalism
[1:29:40] [Applause]
[1:29:43] and we plug into the real power of God
[1:29:47] because there's power in this little
[1:29:49] bride
[1:29:50] there's enough power in this little
[1:29:52] bride gathered here tonight to raise the
[1:29:55] dead and heal the sick open blinded eyes
[1:29:58] and cause the lame to get up and walk
[1:30:00] it's here and we must recognize that
[1:30:04] it's here and we must treat him as
[1:30:07] something so precious and so valuable
[1:30:10] that we don't want to do anything to
[1:30:12] offend the Holy Spirit we want to be
[1:30:15] conduits and we want to be vessels for
[1:30:18] the Holy Ghost to flow through
[1:30:21] is it too loud out there
[1:30:23] you're sure
[1:30:24] if it is let them fix it it seems Mighty
[1:30:27] loud in here to me
[1:30:29] maybe that's because you're so quiet
[1:30:31] I feel good
[1:30:34] I don't know if I feel like preaching or
[1:30:35] not but I feel good hallelujah it's not
[1:30:38] a Feeling
[1:30:40] I know what it means to feel like you're
[1:30:42] in the throes of despair
[1:30:44] come on I know what it feels like to sit
[1:30:47] in the corner and want to eat worms
[1:30:48] because nobody loves you and everybody
[1:30:50] hates you and I've been down that
[1:30:52] Journey
[1:30:53] I've sat under a juniper tree
[1:30:56] I know what it feels like to be under
[1:30:58] the gourd Vine
[1:30:59] you better be careful how much time you
[1:31:01] spend under the gourd Vine because God
[1:31:03] will send a worm to each a gourd Vine
[1:31:05] out of the way
[1:31:06] he'll crack you on the head but that
[1:31:08] gourd won't he and tell you to get up
[1:31:10] and do something for him obedience is
[1:31:12] better than sacrifice God's looking for
[1:31:15] an obedient people in this hour if you
[1:31:18] believe that same man so what we've been
[1:31:20] studying is when we came out of
[1:31:22] Pentecost many many years ago they
[1:31:25] emphasized to us that the Rapture was
[1:31:29] was a a a a blink of an eye it was a it
[1:31:33] was a twinkle of an eye thing you never
[1:31:35] knew when it was going to happen and if
[1:31:38] you called your loved ones and they
[1:31:40] didn't answer the telephone you thought
[1:31:42] the Rapture had taken place
[1:31:49] so disqualify us and lie to us and try
[1:31:53] to steal the joy of Salvation from us
[1:31:55] and I'd call my sainted granny on the
[1:31:58] phone and she wouldn't answer the phone
[1:31:59] she always answer the phone she wouldn't
[1:32:01] answer the phone and I think oh
[1:32:04] I've missed it
[1:32:06] because I knew that it was according to
[1:32:09] what the church was teaching it was a
[1:32:11] very quick thing boom boom and it's over
[1:32:13] with just in a twinkling of an eye it
[1:32:16] never seemed quite right to me
[1:32:19] but I had nothing else to go on
[1:32:22] until I heard a messenger quoting the
[1:32:25] word
[1:32:27] I'd read this verse of scripture as much
[1:32:29] as any of the other verses of scripture
[1:32:31] but I never saw the process until God
[1:32:34] sent a prophet to pull that process
[1:32:37] right out of the pages of the word and
[1:32:39] show me that it's three phases of
[1:32:41] rapture
[1:32:46] hello
[1:32:47] the Lord is descending first in a shout
[1:32:51] and that shout is a message
[1:32:55] and that message is not William Branham
[1:32:58] that message is the revelation of the
[1:33:02] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:06] you see we don't have to have Brother
[1:33:07] branham's picture up in here to remind
[1:33:10] us that God sent a prophet in our day
[1:33:15] it's why we're gathered here this way
[1:33:18] we know what God has done and we honor
[1:33:21] that and we make the quotation and we
[1:33:23] constantly say what he said and try to
[1:33:26] do as he was doing but I want you to
[1:33:29] know that's not all that we've got to be
[1:33:31] concerned about in this hour because
[1:33:34] it's not a prophet coming down that we
[1:33:36] don't want to miss it's the Lord himself
[1:33:38] coming down in a shout and the message
[1:33:41] is not a Doctrine and the message is not
[1:33:44] at another denomination and the message
[1:33:47] is not this or that or the other the
[1:33:49] message is the revelation of the Lord
[1:33:53] Jesus Christ he's no longer behind the
[1:33:56] lattice
[1:33:58] he's no longer hidden behind the ladders
[1:34:01] he has stepped out from behind the
[1:34:03] lattice and he is making himself known
[1:34:07] to his little bride
[1:34:09] all the little turtle doves are cooing
[1:34:13] the springtime is coming
[1:34:16] I I look across this landscape in the
[1:34:19] spirit and I can see as the scripture
[1:34:22] said I can see the little bride coming
[1:34:25] out of the wilderness
[1:34:28] oh just a minute ah
[1:34:31] [Music]
[1:34:33] I can see that little bride coming out
[1:34:36] of the Wilderness and she's not leaning
[1:34:38] on a prophet
[1:34:40] ing on her pastors
[1:34:43] she's not leaning on a five-fold
[1:34:45] Ministry that little bride is leaning on
[1:34:48] her beloved
[1:34:49] who is this that I see coming out of the
[1:34:53] Wilderness this the songwriter wrote
[1:34:55] It's that lovely bride of Jesus Christ
[1:35:00] she's leaning on her broad group
[1:35:02] you know why because she can't walk it
[1:35:04] by herself
[1:35:06] I want to go ahead and tell you you
[1:35:07] can't live this life by yourself you
[1:35:10] can't toe the line by yourself you can't
[1:35:12] work your way to the Revelation I'm
[1:35:14] preaching about tonight it's not about
[1:35:16] striving to get there it's about
[1:35:19] yielding did you know it's easier to
[1:35:21] strive than yield
[1:35:23] it's harder work to yield
[1:35:26] somebody said how could you say it's
[1:35:28] harder work to yield because the Apostle
[1:35:31] tells us that in the book of Hebrews
[1:35:33] he said you've got to strive to rest
[1:35:37] that means it's hard work to get to rest
[1:35:40] but how many of you want to find that
[1:35:42] place of rest in him
[1:35:44] where you can call no matter who and if
[1:35:46] if they don't answer the phone you don't
[1:35:48] have to worry about missing the rapture
[1:35:52] you see I came on into the revelation of
[1:35:54] the message and begin to understand that
[1:35:56] I was born I was created for the rapture
[1:36:00] have come to the Revelation as brother
[1:36:01] Branham did there will be no rapture
[1:36:05] it'll get quiet now half the Cradle amen
[1:36:08] the other half there will be no rapture
[1:36:12] without me
[1:36:15] oh doesn't that sound like bride bride
[1:36:17] well it could be
[1:36:19] but some of you remember you spent many
[1:36:22] years of your life in a faith that
[1:36:24] taught you you couldn't even know you
[1:36:26] were saved
[1:36:28] because to know you were saved was Pride
[1:36:31] oh that breaks my heart
[1:36:34] sister Martha Knowles brother Truman
[1:36:36] knows it's one of the first things I
[1:36:38] ever discussed with them many years ago
[1:36:40] when I met them that's what breaks my
[1:36:42] heart it breaks my heart to think that
[1:36:45] you you ride in a horse and a buggy all
[1:36:47] your life you don't even plug in oh my I
[1:36:50] don't know how to I don't oh I must be
[1:36:53] the worldliest of the worldly I don't
[1:36:56] know how I could make it without a car
[1:36:58] to get where I need to go I don't know
[1:37:00] how I can make it without electricity
[1:37:02] but here I met these people that that
[1:37:05] wouldn't have a frilly curtain in their
[1:37:07] window only a green shade and and living
[1:37:12] not even a button on their clothes some
[1:37:15] of them pinning their clothes because a
[1:37:18] button might be prideful and then you
[1:37:20] begin to talk to them about salvation
[1:37:22] I'm in a little buggy I'm riding in a
[1:37:25] little buggy in Lancaster County with a
[1:37:27] man and I began to talk to him and
[1:37:29] witness to him he lost his whole family
[1:37:31] in a kerosene fire he left the Amish
[1:37:34] Faith because his whole family burned to
[1:37:36] death and I've been getting a witness to
[1:37:38] him and tell him you can know you are
[1:37:40] saved you can know that you've been born
[1:37:43] again
[1:37:44] her hope doesn't lie in the church your
[1:37:47] hope lies in the savior
[1:37:49] said but we've been taught all of our
[1:37:51] lives that you can't even say you're
[1:37:53] saved and I said well it's a shame
[1:37:55] because the Bible said you can
[1:37:58] the Bible said you can know you're saved
[1:38:01] by the coming alive
[1:38:03] King James says quickening of your
[1:38:05] spirit the quickening in your spirit
[1:38:07] it's a resurrection that takes place and
[1:38:11] because you know the old man is dead and
[1:38:13] the new man has come to lie you can know
[1:38:15] that you're saved you get a revelation
[1:38:18] of this message and you can know you're
[1:38:19] not going to miss the rapture
[1:38:22] I love to say this especially to newbies
[1:38:28] brother random said you can come to that
[1:38:31] place of Revelation where you realize
[1:38:33] that you could no more be lost
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:38:42] that's a long way brother Elam Fisher
[1:38:44] that's a long way from not knowing
[1:38:46] you're saved to come all the way over
[1:38:47] here and say I could no more be lost
[1:38:49] than God be lost
[1:38:52] somebody said well what was between that
[1:38:54] it wasn't a false Doctrine it was a
[1:38:56] revelation of a word a word that taught
[1:38:59] us that before this world was ever
[1:39:00] framed God knew it all he knew it all I
[1:39:05] said God knew it all and by his
[1:39:08] foreknowledge by what he knew he knew
[1:39:12] who would choose him and who would not
[1:39:14] choose him and those that would choose
[1:39:17] him he said hey I'll give them a
[1:39:19] prefixed destiny
[1:39:23] I'll send them on a journey through life
[1:39:26] with Hills and Valleys smooth places and
[1:39:30] lots of rough places I'll bring them in
[1:39:33] one church and out of that church and
[1:39:35] into another church and out of that
[1:39:36] church and through another group and out
[1:39:38] of that group
[1:39:40] and they'll stick with me for the ride
[1:39:45] you know why you're where you are today
[1:39:47] because God knew you wouldn't jump off
[1:39:49] the coaster
[1:39:51] he knew
[1:39:54] he knew that you would stay the course
[1:39:58] when he the spirit has come he will lead
[1:40:02] us into what
[1:40:04] oh truth so we begin to hear from a
[1:40:09] prophet that this Rapture right out of
[1:40:11] the scripture it's it's a revelation
[1:40:14] more than an event
[1:40:16] more than an event
[1:40:20] more than a event let me say it goes I
[1:40:22] can't hardly say an event more than an
[1:40:24] event
[1:40:26] it's a process it's a revelation
[1:40:29] it's it's
[1:40:31] a message a shout coming down that
[1:40:35] awakens the sleeping people
[1:40:37] to understand that church is not
[1:40:40] satisfying that longing in our heart and
[1:40:44] even Community is not satisfying that
[1:40:47] longing in our heart because when Jesus
[1:40:51] was hanging on the cross the prophet of
[1:40:54] the Old Testament said he will see his
[1:40:55] seed
[1:40:59] when he was dying suspended Between
[1:41:01] Heaven and Earth
[1:41:03] he saw his seed
[1:41:05] he saw his elect
[1:41:07] he saw you and I anybody with me tonight
[1:41:10] he saw
[1:41:12] he saw it and he knew we would be broken
[1:41:14] people and he knew we would fall and we
[1:41:16] would and we would stumble and he knew
[1:41:19] that we would get discouraged and he
[1:41:21] knew that we would become depressed at
[1:41:23] times and we would have to fight our way
[1:41:25] through but he knew that he was going to
[1:41:27] be there to help us
[1:41:30] he was going to shelter Us in his arms
[1:41:32] and he was going to be there for us to
[1:41:34] lean on him
[1:41:36] here she comes leaning on her beloved
[1:41:39] she doesn't smell like the world anymore
[1:41:41] she doesn't smell like denominational
[1:41:44] system anymore
[1:41:46] she doesn't smell like a trinitarian lie
[1:41:49] anymore
[1:41:51] smells just like her bridegroom her
[1:41:55] fragrance is his fragrance her
[1:41:58] vocabulary must become his vocabulary
[1:42:02] the power of the spoken word must be in
[1:42:05] her mouth even as it was in his mouth
[1:42:08] because the prophet said that we will
[1:42:10] have that little bride will have the
[1:42:13] saith the Lord or she will hold her
[1:42:15] peace
[1:42:16] and so we are on a process as a process
[1:42:20] is unfolding before us
[1:42:22] and a message is gathered us
[1:42:27] we know and I've gone through this
[1:42:29] we that have been here we understand
[1:42:31] Malachi 4 5 and 6. we understand Matthew
[1:42:35] 17 9-13 we understand that he came in a
[1:42:40] shout which was a message to gather the
[1:42:42] elect back to the word of God back to
[1:42:45] God's original thoughts about us well
[1:42:48] that's good
[1:42:49] to call them from the denominations her
[1:42:53] Creeds and dogmas to bring them where
[1:42:56] to the word this is the written record
[1:42:59] of the word
[1:43:03] this is precious to us
[1:43:07] because it is the written record of the
[1:43:09] word but our change doesn't take place
[1:43:11] only by holding on to the written record
[1:43:14] of the word it's the Living Word Jesus
[1:43:17] Christ come on it's the it's
[1:43:20] encountering the Living Word that
[1:43:22] releases us to us the authority in power
[1:43:26] what else do you have I forgot you even
[1:43:28] had that is that all
[1:43:30] well I don't have to preach I can just
[1:43:32] read
[1:43:34] we understand the Midnight Cry
[1:43:37] we understand Matthew 25 and at the
[1:43:40] midnight verse 6 and at the midnight
[1:43:41] there was a cry made behold the
[1:43:44] bridegroom coming go ye out to meet him
[1:43:47] we've heard that
[1:43:49] we've heard Revelation 18 and 4 and I
[1:43:52] heard another voice from Heaven saying
[1:43:54] come out of her
[1:43:56] hey
[1:43:57] yes yes come on you can't read that like
[1:44:00] come out of her no
[1:44:02] you've got to read it like it was come
[1:44:04] out come out here my people
[1:44:06] that should be not partakers of her sin
[1:44:08] and that you receive not of her plagues
[1:44:11] I don't want any part of that Babylonian
[1:44:13] system
[1:44:15] I don't want the paganism of Rome to
[1:44:17] influence my faith today
[1:44:19] can anybody help me
[1:44:22] so we've rejected pagan gods and we've
[1:44:24] rejected Pagan baptism we've rejected
[1:44:27] pagan holidays
[1:44:29] [Applause]
[1:44:31] we've come now into the fullness of the
[1:44:33] word
[1:44:34] and we're being changed we haven't
[1:44:37] arrived yet
[1:44:38] God's still working on us
[1:44:40] because once you eat this book there's
[1:44:43] some more stages that have to take place
[1:44:44] in your life
[1:44:46] because what's originally sweet in your
[1:44:48] mouth is going to get bit bitter in your
[1:44:50] belly
[1:44:52] you're going to have some proving to do
[1:44:55] we understand how God sent that Prophet
[1:44:58] Messenger to turn the hearts of the
[1:45:00] children back to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:45:02] how John the Baptist fulfilled a portion
[1:45:05] of the Malachi prophecy how brother
[1:45:07] Branham was sin of God to fulfill the
[1:45:09] second portion of that prophecy and we
[1:45:12] understand how important it is to listen
[1:45:13] to the prophets
[1:45:15] because Acts chapter 3 verse 23 tells us
[1:45:19] and it shall come to pass that every
[1:45:21] soul which will not hear that Prophet
[1:45:23] shall be destroyed from among the people
[1:45:26] God's real particular about hearing His
[1:45:27] prophets anybody with me
[1:45:30] we've come to understand that the
[1:45:32] message unlocks the gospel of the
[1:45:34] Kingdom
[1:45:36] but what we have not always understood
[1:45:38] is what brother Branham tells us in
[1:45:40] questions and answers on the seals
[1:45:42] paragraph 252.
[1:45:45] and finally one day he said behold there
[1:45:49] he is
[1:45:50] this is John the Baptist this is the one
[1:45:53] chosen to fulfill the first portion of
[1:45:56] Malachi's prophecy
[1:45:58] behold there he is there is a lamb of
[1:46:01] God that takes away the sin of the world
[1:46:03] he didn't say there's my cousin
[1:46:06] he said Behold the Lamb of God that
[1:46:09] takes away the sin of the world and then
[1:46:12] he said and my time is up now
[1:46:16] [Music]
[1:46:19] John the Baptist tell us I must decrease
[1:46:23] because he's coming along to increase
[1:46:26] same thing here the prophet is telling
[1:46:28] us he said I must decrease now
[1:46:31] I must go off the scene just like John
[1:46:34] the Baptist went off the scene he'll
[1:46:37] oh my
[1:46:41] God
[1:46:43] I remember sitting all night in Tucson
[1:46:46] Arizona with brother Perry green
[1:46:49] first time I met him in the early 90s
[1:46:52] we never went to bed
[1:46:55] we had a good service that night when we
[1:46:57] got through we went and got a bite to
[1:46:59] eat when we got through that we came
[1:47:00] back to his
[1:47:02] to its office
[1:47:04] I was staying in brother Sydney
[1:47:06] Jackson's apartment in the back of the
[1:47:08] Tucson Tabernacle
[1:47:10] and brother green began to share stories
[1:47:12] with me
[1:47:13] one right after another about three
[1:47:16] o'clock in the morning
[1:47:18] he said don't you expect we ought to go
[1:47:19] to bed we got to do this again tomorrow
[1:47:21] and I said not not a chance
[1:47:24] I'm not going anywhere I'm going to hear
[1:47:26] the rest of this
[1:47:28] and he began to continue to share
[1:47:30] stories with me in about five o'clock I
[1:47:32] don't know the sun was up and it was
[1:47:33] breakfast time in fact I think maybe we
[1:47:35] went and ate breakfast before we ever
[1:47:37] laid down
[1:47:39] it's because these things are so
[1:47:41] precious
[1:47:42] and he began to describe to me what it
[1:47:45] felt like all of a sudden to realize
[1:47:47] that brother Branham was gone
[1:47:51] it reminded me of how the disciples must
[1:47:54] have felt
[1:47:55] following and seeing these Miracles and
[1:47:58] signs and wonders and now one of the
[1:48:01] most used
[1:48:03] most used Ministry in a whole generation
[1:48:07] believing and brother Brandon was
[1:48:09] constantly talking about what was coming
[1:48:11] and what was coming and what was about
[1:48:13] to happen and the and and and my new
[1:48:16] ministry he talked about and when the
[1:48:18] fullness of that third pool and he was
[1:48:21] constantly pointing to the Future
[1:48:23] and then all of a sudden he was gone
[1:48:28] my brother green tells the story of
[1:48:31] sitting in the airplane hangar
[1:48:34] alone with brother branham's casket
[1:48:38] and he said I'm not ashamed to tell you
[1:48:41] that several times through the night
[1:48:43] while we were waiting on the next flight
[1:48:45] out
[1:48:46] I laid my ear over against that casket
[1:48:50] hoping to hear
[1:48:52] brother brand I'm saying brother Perry
[1:48:55] let me out of here
[1:48:59] I chuckled
[1:49:04] said I know it sounds funny but it
[1:49:06] wasn't funny I was that serious I could
[1:49:09] not see how we could be left like this
[1:49:14] how would we ever get through how would
[1:49:18] we ever make it how would we ever learn
[1:49:21] what we needed to learn and hear what we
[1:49:24] needed to hear and receive what we
[1:49:26] needed to receive and I said well
[1:49:27] brother green I I I appreciate this this
[1:49:30] is the most wonderful testimonies I've
[1:49:33] ever heard in my life
[1:49:34] but I said I just need to remind you of
[1:49:37] something that I read that today that
[1:49:40] brother Branham said and I read him this
[1:49:43] very quote
[1:49:46] we didn't have phones we couldn't pull
[1:49:48] it up on our phone
[1:49:49] I had it printed out and had it in my
[1:49:53] Bible and I reached over and got my
[1:49:54] Bible and I read him this quote and this
[1:49:58] was the part that quickened both of us
[1:50:01] heal take over from here
[1:50:06] if God leaves a generation without a
[1:50:09] prophet messenger you can rest assure
[1:50:12] it's because he plans to take over
[1:50:18] help me now
[1:50:20] it's Jesus Among Us it's Jesus with us
[1:50:24] it's Jesus in US
[1:50:27] [Music]
[1:50:29] and I remember preaching in the
[1:50:30] Christmas meeting that year and stepping
[1:50:33] down you know I often joke about my
[1:50:35] friend uh Jim diff and durfer who went
[1:50:40] to be with the Lord just he was running
[1:50:42] the lights and I would step down to the
[1:50:45] bottom platform and the light would pop
[1:50:47] on I'd step back up behind the pulpit
[1:50:50] and that light would go out and that
[1:50:52] really bothered me I it distracted me
[1:50:54] and finally I said would you just leave
[1:50:56] the lights on or off
[1:50:58] I'm trying to preach down here and
[1:51:00] because of that we became very good
[1:51:01] friends
[1:51:03] I remember what I said that night the
[1:51:05] last time I stepped down and the lights
[1:51:06] went off
[1:51:07] now remember this was a meeting that was
[1:51:10] called to commemorate brother branham's
[1:51:12] homegoing every year the December
[1:51:15] meetings in Tucson Tabernacle they
[1:51:17] always started on the night of the wreck
[1:51:19] and ended on the night of brother
[1:51:20] branham's death
[1:51:22] and so this had been a tradition and the
[1:51:24] bride was coming from all over the world
[1:51:26] and I was the new kid on the Block
[1:51:29] I was only three years four years in the
[1:51:32] message and I had been invited to preach
[1:51:34] this convention I didn't know this was
[1:51:37] going to come out of me I didn't know I
[1:51:39] was standing before return Ministry
[1:51:41] people and people that believe brother
[1:51:43] Brandon was going to raise from the dead
[1:51:44] and have a tent meeting and I didn't
[1:51:46] know half of what was in that room that
[1:51:48] night all I knew is the Lord had said to
[1:51:50] me as a little boy you open your mouth
[1:51:52] and I will fill it
[1:51:54] and I opened my mouth that night and I
[1:51:57] stepped down to that lower level and a
[1:51:58] voice spoke out of me it was sounding
[1:52:00] like me but I don't know where it come
[1:52:02] from
[1:52:03] and that voice said I God would have
[1:52:06] never taken his servant there's not an
[1:52:10] accident there was not a car accident
[1:52:12] that was not a death there was not a
[1:52:15] disease that could have taken brother
[1:52:16] branham's life had God not have been
[1:52:19] finished
[1:52:24] with what he sent him here to do
[1:52:29] and when I said it it shocked me and I
[1:52:31] caught myself like that I looked up
[1:52:33] there at brother green and he goes
[1:52:35] oh yeah
[1:52:40] I said brother green am I wrong
[1:52:43] did I say something wrong am I going to
[1:52:45] get in trouble for it he said I didn't
[1:52:47] do that
[1:52:49] because you were wrong
[1:52:51] I did it because I had never thought of
[1:52:53] it myself
[1:52:56] he said I've still been asking God why
[1:52:59] why did you why did he have to go now
[1:53:01] why did he have to go in the car
[1:53:03] accident
[1:53:07] why did it have to be why did it have to
[1:53:09] be that way and he said all of a sudden
[1:53:11] when you said that it was like a light
[1:53:13] bulb come on God never makes a mistake
[1:53:17] he took him because he knew that if he
[1:53:19] left brother Brandon here the people
[1:53:21] would continue to cling to him
[1:53:25] it would have become a bigger cult today
[1:53:28] than it already is in some places
[1:53:32] the reason why God was able to take
[1:53:34] brother random is because he knew that
[1:53:37] he was coming him
[1:53:40] take care of business because if you get
[1:53:44] this Living Word in the people
[1:53:47] yeah
[1:53:49] if you get it out of their heads and
[1:53:52] into their hearts by revelation
[1:53:56] then it's Jesus Among Us
[1:53:59] oh you got to help me
[1:54:01] [Applause]
[1:54:02] you've got to learn to look beyond the
[1:54:04] badger skins brother
[1:54:07] the badger skins will fail you
[1:54:09] your pastors will fail you your leaders
[1:54:12] will fail you but there's one living in
[1:54:14] your shoe leather
[1:54:17] or or are living in your bare feet
[1:54:19] brother
[1:54:20] there's one living in you that'll never
[1:54:23] fail you
[1:54:24] [Applause]
[1:54:26] there'll not be a Rapture without you in
[1:54:28] it if God saw you before the foundation
[1:54:32] of the world and you were in his mind he
[1:54:34] gave you a prefix destiny
[1:54:37] he intended to take care of whatever he
[1:54:40] has to take care of to get you to that
[1:54:42] place
[1:54:43] so when the Trials come be careful how
[1:54:45] you murmur
[1:54:48] when the heartaches come be careful how
[1:54:50] you complain
[1:54:51] [Applause]
[1:54:52] because God harnesses the prophet said
[1:54:55] God harness his troubles
[1:54:57] he takes them by the reins and pulls
[1:55:01] them in so that they can transport you
[1:55:03] and I
[1:55:09] changed
[1:55:10] we're being changed
[1:55:13] he said I've introduced you to him I
[1:55:15] must decrease now I must go off the
[1:55:17] scene he'll take over from here the
[1:55:19] Millennium will be on right away see the
[1:55:22] time is at hand
[1:55:27] and then the spoken word is the Original
[1:55:28] Seed and I've got to hurry paragraph 119
[1:55:31] brother random said my mission
[1:55:34] that I believe that God has called me
[1:55:36] for
[1:55:38] he said I have to say some personal
[1:55:39] things today
[1:55:41] because that's what I told you I do see
[1:55:43] and tell the world
[1:55:45] my mission I believe to the Earth is is
[1:55:47] what is to forerun
[1:55:50] [Music]
[1:55:55] you see brother random knew what was
[1:55:57] following him
[1:56:00] he knew that once that word gotten to
[1:56:02] people
[1:56:03] you understand what I'm saying when that
[1:56:07] Living Word comes inside of you he gives
[1:56:09] you full Authority
[1:56:10] yeah
[1:56:12] somebody said I'll be so glad when the
[1:56:15] power of the spoken word is restored I
[1:56:16] thought that's what the truth came to do
[1:56:18] I thought it was restored
[1:56:21] the power of the spoken word is restored
[1:56:24] God's just building a house to live in
[1:56:26] right now
[1:56:28] he's just getting the people ready
[1:56:31] so that when he speaks she speaks for
[1:56:33] him
[1:56:36] did you know the voice of the archangel
[1:56:38] it's the voice of Christ in a many
[1:56:42] membered bride
[1:56:46] did you know it's prophesy again
[1:56:50] did you know it's not enough to say that
[1:56:52] a prophet has brought us the word now a
[1:56:54] people has to produce the proof
[1:56:57] that she has been with the bridegroom
[1:57:03] you see there was a time we could say
[1:57:05] well I go to that church I belong to
[1:57:07] that church that man is my pastor I'm
[1:57:09] following that
[1:57:10] but how many of you know we've come to
[1:57:12] an hour now where none of that means
[1:57:14] anything
[1:57:15] it's going to be who's been with Christ
[1:57:17] who's been in the tent with him
[1:57:20] [Music]
[1:57:22] yes who has known him in an intimate way
[1:57:26] don't don't be vulgar
[1:57:28] understand what it means to be in to be
[1:57:31] intimate with Christ
[1:57:33] do you know the word no in the Bible is
[1:57:36] a word that is used for knowing a man
[1:57:38] it's also the same word that's used for
[1:57:40] receiving a revelation of Truth
[1:57:44] and so we understand that as our
[1:57:46] bridegroom we We join ourselves with him
[1:57:49] we must go into that Bridal canopy
[1:57:55] that veil has to fall behind us the
[1:57:57] prophet said shutting out the world
[1:57:59] shutting us into the glories of Christ
[1:58:03] how many of you are willing to go behind
[1:58:04] the veil with him
[1:58:08] I've got many friends who want
[1:58:12] I've got many friends who want because
[1:58:14] if you call them to anything higher they
[1:58:16] want to turn around and see if they can
[1:58:18] take brother Brandon by the hand
[1:58:21] or they want to see if they can turn
[1:58:23] around and get their Pastor or preacher
[1:58:24] by the hand and pull him in but I want
[1:58:27] you to know that two is a company
[1:58:29] and three is a crowd there is a place in
[1:58:33] Jesus Christ that only you and him can
[1:58:35] go
[1:58:37] did you know a husband can't go there
[1:58:39] for his wife and a wife can't go there
[1:58:42] for her husband and God has no
[1:58:45] grandchildren
[1:58:47] each one of us may have must have our
[1:58:49] own personal experience with Jesus
[1:58:52] Christ we must all be changed we must
[1:58:56] all be Sanctified by the washing of the
[1:58:59] water of the word and filled with the
[1:59:01] earnest of the Holy Ghost until we come
[1:59:03] to the ceiling
[1:59:05] so here he goes on to say my Ministry is
[1:59:08] to forerun the coming word
[1:59:10] and then if you've got any any concern
[1:59:13] about what the coming word is he tells
[1:59:15] us it's not it's not a book
[1:59:18] it's not an app
[1:59:20] it's not a tape
[1:59:22] the coming word is a person
[1:59:27] you sure you see that
[1:59:29] he said the coming word which is Christ
[1:59:31] and Christ in him has the millennium
[1:59:36] so you bring Christ into the People by
[1:59:40] the power of the Living Word brother
[1:59:41] Branham comes to forerun the coming word
[1:59:43] then the coming word steps on the scene
[1:59:46] which is which is Christ in plain view
[1:59:50] out from behind the veil out from behind
[1:59:53] the lattice and then he steps into his
[1:59:56] people by the genuine baptism of the
[1:59:58] Holy Ghost
[2:00:00] and by doing so the Millennium is in
[2:00:03] Christ
[2:00:05] so when Christ comes into you he brings
[2:00:07] the hope of the millennium
[2:00:13] somebody give me some example of what
[2:00:15] the Bible there is a millennium by the
[2:00:17] way
[2:00:18] there's a literal devil
[2:00:22] it may not be Eternal but there's a
[2:00:24] literal hell
[2:00:27] you see the only way to have eternal
[2:00:30] life is to be born again
[2:00:33] isn't that right didn't the scripture
[2:00:35] say The Souls of sin it shall surely die
[2:00:37] brother man said I don't know how long
[2:00:39] hell this is I I don't know it could be
[2:00:41] a million years or a thousand years or
[2:00:43] ten thousand years nobody knows but he
[2:00:46] said the scripture said the soul that
[2:00:47] Sinners shall surely die the only way to
[2:00:50] have eternal life is to have Jesus
[2:00:51] Christ Living inside he brings Zoe life
[2:00:54] which is eternal life
[2:00:55] and you get all of that in you but but
[2:00:59] yes there's a literal devil yes there's
[2:01:01] a literal hell
[2:01:02] yes there is a literal millennium
[2:01:06] but there's also a principle and concept
[2:01:08] of millennium
[2:01:10] and when you get Christ when you receive
[2:01:12] the Living Word into your life he brings
[2:01:14] all that the Millennium is with him
[2:01:17] so can somebody tell me something the
[2:01:19] scripture says about the millennium
[2:01:21] give me an example I'm opening the floor
[2:01:26] what what what are what are some verses
[2:01:28] that that tell us about the coming
[2:01:30] Millennium and what it would be like
[2:01:35] to to live and reign with Christ a
[2:01:38] thousand years what is the description
[2:01:40] of what that will look like
[2:01:45] it is Sabbath it is rest what I'm
[2:01:48] looking for tonight is this
[2:01:51] this verse that we get the song from
[2:01:54] the lion
[2:01:57] shall lay down next to the lamb
[2:02:02] a little child shall lead them
[2:02:05] a little baby a little infant playing on
[2:02:07] the whole of the asp
[2:02:09] one of the most poisonous snakes
[2:02:12] the the wolf shall be tame
[2:02:16] you know why
[2:02:18] because the curse is removed
[2:02:25] it's not that sink in
[2:02:29] the curse is removed
[2:02:31] that's one of the greatest things about
[2:02:33] the Millennium is there's no more curse
[2:02:36] so the animal the animal kingdom
[2:02:38] functions as it was created to function
[2:02:40] in the beginning there's no dangerous
[2:02:42] animal they all love one another
[2:02:44] they roll around can you imagine oh my
[2:02:47] goodness
[2:02:48] I guarantee you I'm going to lay down on
[2:02:50] a lion
[2:02:54] I guarantee you I'm going to lay my big
[2:02:56] old head right up against a big old
[2:02:59] beautiful roaring lion
[2:03:03] and he'll never look at me like a snack
[2:03:07] or is like Ben says about me a buffet
[2:03:15] oh yeah end up being so they gonna see
[2:03:16] who you are
[2:03:18] the boy who dares to call me that
[2:03:23] he he will love me
[2:03:26] and I will love him the wolf will lay on
[2:03:29] my lap
[2:03:32] there will be no need to break the
[2:03:34] ground I know the farmers in here be
[2:03:36] thankful for that
[2:03:37] there will be no reason to till the land
[2:03:39] anymore or plant the seed
[2:03:43] or or this is my part I'm I've never run
[2:03:46] a farm I have worked a little bit as a
[2:03:48] boy on my grandparents farm and what I
[2:03:51] hated the worst was getting the weeds oh
[2:03:54] my goodness
[2:03:57] and and you know what the sometimes
[2:03:59] little kids around here they don't know
[2:04:01] what happens and they they'll come in
[2:04:03] they want to help you pull weeds
[2:04:05] and they'll get them and shake them real
[2:04:07] good
[2:04:08] so all the seed go right back in the
[2:04:10] ground
[2:04:12] you know we've got those little see
[2:04:13] those little weeds we get around here
[2:04:15] that's got the the spores underneath
[2:04:18] like a fern
[2:04:19] and they're just shaking them like that
[2:04:21] and you so it's just a constant effort
[2:04:23] to get them out but I'm telling you in
[2:04:24] the Millennium the Earth is no longer
[2:04:26] under its curse
[2:04:28] the animal kingdom is no longer when
[2:04:30] Christ comes to live inside if brother
[2:04:32] Branham could move out of the way if
[2:04:35] John the Baptist could move out of the
[2:04:36] way so Christ could step in if brother
[2:04:39] Branham could move out of the way when
[2:04:41] God was finished with his commission so
[2:04:43] that Christ The Living Word could step
[2:04:45] inside of his bride when he comes in he
[2:04:47] brings the Millennium with him
[2:04:49] he brings Eternal peace with him he
[2:04:52] brings Sabbath rest with him he brings
[2:04:56] no more curse with him right if there's
[2:05:00] no more curse there's no more
[2:05:02] condemnation
[2:05:05] if the curse is finished and the laws
[2:05:07] are changed
[2:05:09] and there is therefore now
[2:05:11] help me a little bit no condemnation to
[2:05:15] them which are in Christ Jesus come on
[2:05:18] now so if something condemns you it's
[2:05:20] not Jesus doing that the Holy Spirit
[2:05:23] Will convict you and when conviction
[2:05:26] comes it comes with hope
[2:05:30] that all you have to do is call on him
[2:05:33] and he'll roll that thing out of your
[2:05:34] life when condemnation and guilt comes
[2:05:37] you know it comes from Satan because
[2:05:39] there's no hope attached to it
[2:05:43] say what I heard a brother say today
[2:05:45] it was just one cycle just just one
[2:05:47] thing after another pulling myself up
[2:05:50] and out and back down up and out and
[2:05:52] falling down and up and down that that's
[2:05:54] what happens
[2:05:55] when we don't understand what Christ has
[2:05:57] really come to accomplish in us and
[2:06:00] brother Branham had to move out of the
[2:06:01] way in order for the bride to be able to
[2:06:04] come into the fullness of what was
[2:06:05] promised to her this doesn't mean we
[2:06:08] don't need conviction we need more
[2:06:09] conviction today than we've ever had
[2:06:11] because the world is creeping in Among
[2:06:13] Us
[2:06:15] these sisters around the message
[2:06:17] sometimes their skirts are getting
[2:06:18] shorter
[2:06:21] they're walking around with no sleeves
[2:06:24] they've got so much jewelry on
[2:06:27] the men wear their jeans so tight that
[2:06:30] there's nothing to the imagination if
[2:06:31] someone wanted to imagine come on
[2:06:36] they have Christmas trees in every room
[2:06:38] including the bathroom
[2:06:48] that's what's happening around the
[2:06:49] bright Church
[2:06:51] we're not even talking about
[2:06:53] denominations
[2:06:54] we're talking about what's happening in
[2:06:56] some of our own camps
[2:06:57] oh my have we ever do we ever need the
[2:07:02] living Christ The Living Word to step on
[2:07:05] the scene
[2:07:06] do we ever need to let brother Branham
[2:07:09] decrease
[2:07:15] Christ can increase
[2:07:18] [Applause]
[2:07:28] Christ has the Millennium and has
[2:07:30] everything right here because he is the
[2:07:32] word now in that powerful
[2:07:35] and so first the first coming in that
[2:07:37] shout was the word coming the word
[2:07:40] coming of Christ I want you to say that
[2:07:41] the word coming of Christ
[2:07:44] that was Christ coming in the fullness
[2:07:46] of the shout in the fullness of the word
[2:07:49] in the fullness of the message
[2:07:52] and then number two is the bride coming
[2:07:54] of Christ
[2:07:58] that takes place under the voice of the
[2:08:01] archangel
[2:08:02] which is Christ
[2:08:04] it's his voice
[2:08:06] but it's being echoed
[2:08:09] by a people
[2:08:11] a people who have laid their head on his
[2:08:14] shoulder
[2:08:15] [Music]
[2:08:17] a people who have longed to know his
[2:08:20] heartbeat
[2:08:23] you see the church out there they think
[2:08:25] that the heartbeat of God is filling the
[2:08:26] pew
[2:08:28] God could care less about your filled
[2:08:32] pews
[2:08:34] the denominations around here they'll
[2:08:36] offer people a big screen TV if they
[2:08:38] bring the most people to church
[2:08:44] it's a good thing you brought people to
[2:08:45] church because we're going to give you
[2:08:47] something that will take you right into
[2:08:48] hell if you if you feed on all the filth
[2:08:50] of that thing
[2:08:53] but they use that to attract people not
[2:08:56] to Christ
[2:08:59] to their Church
[2:09:00] to their Pew to their organization
[2:09:03] Christ is not looking for your Pew to be
[2:09:05] packed he's looking for your life to be
[2:09:08] packed with the word
[2:09:10] it's not how much of the word of God you
[2:09:13] go through no it's how much of God's
[2:09:15] word goes through you
[2:09:17] are you eating are you eating the book
[2:09:20] are you feasting on the Living Word are
[2:09:24] you hearing the shout
[2:09:26] we must
[2:09:28] we're changed when we hear it there's
[2:09:31] something on the inside the seed of God
[2:09:34] responds it reacts
[2:09:40] you that just saw the podcast
[2:09:43] you'll remember little brother Cleveland
[2:09:45] who brought me those tapes
[2:09:49] six cassettes for two sermons
[2:09:52] the spoken word is the Original Seed
[2:09:55] he hands them to me in a brown paper bag
[2:09:57] and my Church of God Deacon says you
[2:10:00] better stay away from that man he's a
[2:10:02] good man I worked with him at the
[2:10:03] fiberglass plant
[2:10:04] but he believes crazy things about even
[2:10:07] the rattlesnake
[2:10:11] said you better stay away from him
[2:10:13] I noticed that many of you laugh
[2:10:16] you know my little hole in his mind I
[2:10:18] was raised in in Holiness and uh
[2:10:21] I didn't even wear a short sleeve in
[2:10:24] those days a watch or any of this the
[2:10:26] light I wanted to please the church in
[2:10:28] everything
[2:10:31] and now this man tells me that that this
[2:10:35] preacher believes something strange
[2:10:36] About Eve having relationship with a
[2:10:38] rattlesnake my mind there's no way my
[2:10:42] mind could have got around that
[2:10:44] I said that ain't for me
[2:10:48] that couldn't be for me that sounds like
[2:10:50] pornography that couldn't be for me
[2:10:53] you see it's sometimes it's how things
[2:10:55] are presented
[2:10:58] I don't mean any harm I'm not much of a
[2:11:00] Preacher
[2:11:02] but there's two things that make me want
[2:11:04] to preach
[2:11:07] when I hear a preacher who can
[2:11:12] and when I hear a preacher who can't
[2:11:18] that's why I like to sing I'm not much
[2:11:20] of a singer but when I hear people that
[2:11:22] can and people that can't it makes both
[2:11:24] of them inspire me to want to sing
[2:11:26] and when I hear preachers that can't
[2:11:28] preach I want to preach it really makes
[2:11:30] me want to preach
[2:11:32] and I'm going to be completely honest
[2:11:34] with you when I hear some of the crazy
[2:11:37] ways people present this truth
[2:11:42] I am more convinced every day that it's
[2:11:45] my election
[2:11:49] because there's no way in the world some
[2:11:52] people could have ever swam through the
[2:11:54] mess
[2:11:55] of preaching
[2:11:58] to get to the reality of the truth of
[2:12:01] this message
[2:12:03] but because that representation was in
[2:12:06] them they ignored the craziness of the
[2:12:09] presenter and they starved for a little
[2:12:12] nugget of Truth
[2:12:14] [Applause]
[2:12:18] if you thought we started early so that
[2:12:21] we could get out early
[2:12:24] thank you
[2:12:26] thank you
[2:12:28] I said well I don't want any of that
[2:12:31] so I put it up on the top shelf that was
[2:12:33] first time I boxed it up
[2:12:37] I actually boxed it up twice
[2:12:39] but the first time I boxed it up
[2:12:43] I boxed it up because of how someone
[2:12:46] presented to me what someone else
[2:12:47] believed don't do that find out for
[2:12:50] yourself
[2:12:51] [Music]
[2:12:53] do you know why some folks are here
[2:12:55] tonight
[2:12:58] we've got a brother who streams every
[2:13:00] service from Uganda
[2:13:02] I read his letter to you he sends me a
[2:13:04] screenshot of every service from Uganda
[2:13:08] so so I'll know he's on
[2:13:11] or that I know he's watching the archive
[2:13:14] and he said I mentioned your name
[2:13:15] because I remembered you coming you've
[2:13:17] gone to many years ago and he said they
[2:13:19] all warned me to stay away
[2:13:21] and not to follow anything to do after
[2:13:23] you and he said which made me all the
[2:13:26] more curious
[2:13:27] [Music]
[2:13:31] you see that's the difference between a
[2:13:33] child of God and religion
[2:13:35] the religious would say oh my
[2:13:37] denomination doesn't sanction that
[2:13:39] preacher
[2:13:44] remember what TLD and Daisy Osborne sent
[2:13:47] the Assemblies of God told them not to
[2:13:49] go here brother random
[2:13:51] in fact T.L didn't go the first night
[2:13:53] Daisy found an old woman in the church
[2:13:55] who said I'm too old to care what they
[2:13:57] say about me that's what she said she
[2:13:59] said I'll go with you to hear Brother
[2:14:00] Branham
[2:14:03] and were they ever glad that they got to
[2:14:05] see Jesus on display
[2:14:07] and so the first time so I put it up
[2:14:09] there and then things really went awry
[2:14:12] and in the little church where we were
[2:14:14] things began to get all messed up and
[2:14:16] shifting and friends and preachers that
[2:14:18] I'd preached with for years said we we
[2:14:21] don't want anything to do with you we
[2:14:22] hear you're coming into some strange
[2:14:23] Doctrine and I said I don't even know
[2:14:25] what that could be
[2:14:27] I didn't even realize it was
[2:14:31] somebody had told them that I had the
[2:14:33] tapes
[2:14:34] that traveled across that City so fast
[2:14:37] every preacher in the county knew that
[2:14:40] that someone had given me brother
[2:14:41] branham's tapes and I didn't even know
[2:14:43] what I had
[2:14:45] I just thought I heard must be some
[2:14:47] strange ideas
[2:14:49] if Eve had a fellowship with a
[2:14:52] rattlesnake
[2:14:56] I'm I got my head on my desk and I'm I
[2:14:59] am crying I'm boohoo and I'm sobbing I'm
[2:15:01] not ashamed to tell you
[2:15:03] and I said Lord I've been following you
[2:15:05] all these years and
[2:15:06] and I'm in a mess I I'm not happy I I
[2:15:10] I'm miserable
[2:15:12] and I need an answer from you
[2:15:15] and that same voice that had spoke to me
[2:15:17] so many times through the years spoke to
[2:15:19] my heart and said the answer to all of
[2:15:21] your problems
[2:15:23] is in that brown paper bag
[2:15:26] up on the Shelf I heard that voice I
[2:15:28] knew that was his voice
[2:15:30] so I got up and climbed got up in the
[2:15:32] chair and took that down and I remember
[2:15:34] unraveling that bag and and I took out
[2:15:37] the first tape spoken word his Original
[2:15:38] Seed
[2:15:39] spoken words original scene
[2:15:41] spoken word is original C
[2:15:44] spoke on Words original C six times
[2:15:47] I said why that man is more long-winded
[2:15:49] than I am
[2:15:51] I what I really said was I said he
[2:15:54] either has one sermon to preach or he's
[2:15:56] more long-winded than I am
[2:15:58] that was my attitude
[2:16:00] aren't you glad God looks over your
[2:16:02] ignorance sometimes
[2:16:04] I got an old cassette player down
[2:16:07] and I put that tape in and I began to
[2:16:10] hear
[2:16:11] but remember now I'm I'm listening from
[2:16:13] a place of a little bit of fear because
[2:16:15] of what had been said
[2:16:17] so I heard every haint
[2:16:21] I heard every not that I was an English
[2:16:24] scholar
[2:16:25] but I heard all the murdering of the
[2:16:27] English language
[2:16:29] I heard all the stutters
[2:16:34] sometimes brother Brandon would sound
[2:16:36] like an engine getting started you know
[2:16:39] I heard all that I don't hear it now
[2:16:42] but I heard it that day
[2:16:44] but it wasn't long
[2:16:46] until I wasn't listening to brother
[2:16:48] Brandon anymore
[2:16:51] it's true it's true that Kentucky
[2:16:53] English didn't bother me anymore oh
[2:16:55] excuse me
[2:16:57] uh
[2:16:58] some of your neighbors to Kentucky
[2:16:59] aren't you there Arkansas where they
[2:17:01] speak the same language
[2:17:04] now we Alabama People we're refined here
[2:17:11] oh you're from Kentucky
[2:17:13] you know the language don't you
[2:17:17] or did I ever dig deep that time
[2:17:23] I began to hear everything my heart was
[2:17:25] longing for
[2:17:27] amen I didn't hear the I didn't hear the
[2:17:30] stutters anymore I didn't hear the
[2:17:32] haints and the Ants and the tizens and
[2:17:34] the and all that anymore I didn't begin
[2:17:36] to hear that just faded off in the
[2:17:38] distance somewhere and I sat right there
[2:17:40] until I heard it all
[2:17:42] [Music]
[2:17:44] a stick of dynamite under my office
[2:17:46] chair couldn't have moved me
[2:17:50] when I realized the hour my mother was
[2:17:53] off work from the bank that day she was
[2:17:54] living with me in the parsonage of the
[2:17:57] church that I was pastoring in South
[2:17:58] Carolina and I ran in and I'll never
[2:18:01] forget it she was standing at the stove
[2:18:03] frying okra
[2:18:08] and I went in and I did something I'd
[2:18:10] never done before I I hugged her and I
[2:18:13] spun her around
[2:18:15] in the kitchen almost like a dance
[2:18:19] and my mother looked at me she said what
[2:18:21] in the world is wrong with you
[2:18:23] anybody know my mama
[2:18:25] anybody believe she said it just like
[2:18:27] that Steve
[2:18:29] no no no Stephen Lamar Shelley what's
[2:18:32] wrong with you I said oh mother I don't
[2:18:34] even know how to begin to tell you I
[2:18:37] have heard the voice of God today
[2:18:38] speaking through a man
[2:18:41] she said well isn't that what we hear
[2:18:43] every time we hear preaching
[2:18:46] is the voice of God speaking through a
[2:18:47] man and I said but mother it's like this
[2:18:50] never a man spake like this man
[2:18:54] every question I ever had in my heart he
[2:18:58] was answering as though he was reading
[2:19:00] my heart
[2:19:05] remember folks I didn't even know that
[2:19:07] brother random was dead
[2:19:10] when I got through listening those tapes
[2:19:12] I got Brother Cleveland on the phone and
[2:19:14] said take me to him
[2:19:18] I don't have to meet him
[2:19:20] I I don't have to have an audience with
[2:19:22] him
[2:19:23] I just would love to shake his hand
[2:19:26] but I've got to be where he is even if
[2:19:30] it's just for a few moments and brother
[2:19:32] Cleveland's laughing in the other end of
[2:19:34] the phone oh
[2:19:35] oh
[2:19:37] he said brother Shelley brother Branham
[2:19:39] died in 1965.
[2:19:41] I screamed
[2:19:44] awesome
[2:19:46] three years before I was ever born
[2:19:49] he had already come and gone
[2:19:51] there came a time in my life that I
[2:19:53] thanked God
[2:19:55] on my knees
[2:19:57] that he took brother Branham before I
[2:19:58] was born
[2:20:00] but I couldn't thank him right that
[2:20:02] moment
[2:20:03] there was a time later that I said Lord
[2:20:04] I know what I'd have been
[2:20:09] I'd have been a brand of mine
[2:20:12] I just slept on his porch
[2:20:15] hoping that I could have got a little of
[2:20:17] that unction on me and so I'm blessed
[2:20:19] I'm blessed because you took him before
[2:20:21] I was ever born and I can see what he
[2:20:24] came to do he came to introduce me to
[2:20:26] you
[2:20:30] so don't ever think that we're taking
[2:20:33] away
[2:20:34] from the man or the ministry
[2:20:36] but we must obey what he said
[2:20:39] and we must understand that he came to
[2:20:42] forerun the coming word
[2:20:44] that's not another preacher's Ministry
[2:20:47] oh no that's Jesus in you that's the
[2:20:50] hope of glory in you that's Christ form
[2:20:55] in you little children a travailing verb
[2:20:59] for you until Christ be formed in you
[2:21:05] you stand a better chance in this
[2:21:07] message than anywhere else
[2:21:11] of Heaven Christ formed in you
[2:21:15] not because you're sitting under the
[2:21:17] preaching of the word but you're sitting
[2:21:18] in the presence of the Living Word
[2:21:21] and he brings change
[2:21:24] is anybody with me
[2:21:26] and so we come to the word coming of
[2:21:29] Christ and then the bride coming of
[2:21:31] Christ and there's nothing left then but
[2:21:33] what we read in Thessalonians the
[2:21:35] bridegroom coming of Christ when he
[2:21:37] comes himself to receive a little bride
[2:21:42] in Revelation chapter 10
[2:21:45] we're moving into the
[2:21:47] to the last phase for for now
[2:21:50] 10 10.
[2:21:53] and I took the little book out of the
[2:21:54] Angel's hand
[2:21:56] and I ate it up
[2:21:58] you better be eating this book
[2:22:04] it was once a sealed book
[2:22:07] can I show you all something
[2:22:10] can you pull that down and put up
[2:22:11] something else
[2:22:12] can you put up Daniel 12 4.
[2:22:17] in King James and then in the Amplified
[2:22:21] but thou old Daniel just watch this for
[2:22:23] a moment I'm all over the place
[2:22:25] that's what happens when I try to review
[2:22:27] and move on to something else
[2:22:28] but thou old Daniel shut up the words
[2:22:31] and seal the book
[2:22:33] even to the time of the end
[2:22:37] you're still with me
[2:22:38] many shall run to and fro
[2:22:42] and knowledge shall be increased
[2:22:47] how's that possible
[2:22:49] with a shut book
[2:22:51] with a sealed book
[2:22:54] well Revelation 5 tells us how
[2:22:56] that book that was once sealed
[2:22:58] is no longer sealed
[2:23:00] not because brother Branham took the
[2:23:02] book and Lucia seals are of because the
[2:23:04] lamb took the book and lucifield Jesus
[2:23:07] Christ took the book and Luther seals
[2:23:09] her up and gave the revelation of what
[2:23:10] was underneath those seals by symbol
[2:23:12] first to his servant brother Branham
[2:23:15] who was the voice of the seventh angel
[2:23:17] there's no doubt about it
[2:23:23] I heard this so this verse for so many
[2:23:26] years in such a negative way
[2:23:30] the book is sealed people are going to
[2:23:32] run to and fro they're going to get all
[2:23:34] all spark smart with head knowledge and
[2:23:36] and this is going to be a terrible time
[2:23:38] in the end
[2:23:40] I began to look at that in Hebrew and
[2:23:42] I'm not a scholar
[2:23:44] people send me things all the time
[2:23:45] wanting me to interpret Hebrew letters
[2:23:47] and I have to Google it just like you do
[2:23:51] but I have studied the language the
[2:23:52] ancient Biblical Hebrew quite a bit I
[2:23:55] wished I could retain more I wished I
[2:23:57] would have taken the time to learn more
[2:24:00] but I know how to get a hold of the
[2:24:02] tools
[2:24:03] and I know how to use the tools that we
[2:24:05] have available in this hour
[2:24:07] and that helps me so much so I decided
[2:24:10] one day many years ago I would take
[2:24:11] Daniel 12 and 4 and I would take it to
[2:24:14] to the original language and I would see
[2:24:16] what it said and then I found a version
[2:24:19] that actually captured the original
[2:24:22] of Daniel 12 4 the Amplified and I want
[2:24:24] to read it to you
[2:24:26] and I want to want you to see that it it
[2:24:28] reached entirely different because this
[2:24:31] is based on the original language it
[2:24:33] says but you owe Daniel shut up the
[2:24:35] words and seal the book until the time
[2:24:37] of the end then many shall run to and
[2:24:41] fro and search anxiously
[2:24:46] come on
[2:24:49] well I thought the book was sealed
[2:24:53] you see somehow God let Daniel know
[2:24:57] you seal it up because one day I'm going
[2:25:00] to send one
[2:25:03] that's going to be there when the book
[2:25:05] is opened
[2:25:07] and this now he's describing the end
[2:25:08] times then many shall run to and fro and
[2:25:11] search anxiously through the book and
[2:25:13] the knowledge of God's purposes
[2:25:17] as revealed by His prophets
[2:25:20] shall be increased and become great
[2:25:27] now that's what come out of looking at
[2:25:29] the originals at first I broke it down
[2:25:31] myself
[2:25:32] using each word that actually appears in
[2:25:35] the Hebrew language and then after
[2:25:37] reading it I said well this is saying
[2:25:40] something quite different than what I'm
[2:25:42] picking up from King James
[2:25:44] so I began to search through 30 plus
[2:25:47] versions
[2:25:48] to find one that expressed most closely
[2:25:53] what was being said in the original
[2:25:55] language and you know what I believe our
[2:25:57] day is being spoken of right there I
[2:25:59] believe there are people in this room
[2:26:01] right now that are the Fulfillment of
[2:26:03] what was being spoken of in Daniel
[2:26:05] chapter 12 4. the book is no longer
[2:26:07] sealed and we are now a people searching
[2:26:10] anxiously through that open book and
[2:26:13] because of that our knowledge of the
[2:26:15] purposes of God is increasing we are
[2:26:19] understanding who he is and who we are
[2:26:22] because of who he is
[2:26:25] the greatest mystery that's ever been
[2:26:27] revealed the mystery of God the mystery
[2:26:32] notice Revelation 10 7 is not plural
[2:26:35] it's not the Mysteries
[2:26:37] this is how brother Branham often quoted
[2:26:39] it
[2:26:40] but he tells us to take what he says
[2:26:43] back to the word so we go back to
[2:26:45] Revelation 10 7 and it doesn't say and
[2:26:47] the Mystery should be finished
[2:26:49] it says what
[2:26:52] and the Mystery
[2:26:55] so I looked at that in the original
[2:26:57] language and it's a singular word it's
[2:26:59] not a plural word it's a singular word
[2:27:02] and so we go searching
[2:27:05] what is the mystery
[2:27:08] that is supposed to be finished
[2:27:10] when the seventh angel begins to sound
[2:27:12] his voice in Revelation 10 7 and guess
[2:27:16] where the answers found in the message
[2:27:17] of the hour
[2:27:18] uh
[2:27:20] because brother Branham comes and tells
[2:27:22] us two things
[2:27:23] he tells us
[2:27:25] that the most important revelation
[2:27:29] is that Jehovah
[2:27:32] of the Old Testament
[2:27:34] is Jesus
[2:27:36] of the New Testament
[2:27:38] now somebody said that doesn't seem so
[2:27:40] profound I guess it does if you've been
[2:27:42] in a trinitarian church all your life
[2:27:46] I've had trinitarian Pentecostal tell me
[2:27:48] well that's what I believe I said well
[2:27:49] you may believe that but that's not what
[2:27:51] your church teaches your church doesn't
[2:27:53] teach that Jehovah of the old is Jesus
[2:27:55] of the new
[2:27:56] your church teaches that Jesus is the
[2:27:59] second person of the trinity
[2:28:02] the second person of the godhead and the
[2:28:04] reality is Jesus is the only person of
[2:28:08] the godhead
[2:28:10] the eternal spirit of the father is
[2:28:12] there which also overshadowed Mary and
[2:28:15] she conceived our Lord but there's only
[2:28:17] one person in that godhead and that is
[2:28:19] Jesus Christ Jehovah of the Old
[2:28:22] Testament is indeed Jesus Christ of the
[2:28:26] New Testament so we take that as part of
[2:28:29] the mystery
[2:28:30] and then we hear this amazing message
[2:28:35] in fact I'm not sure but I think that's
[2:28:37] the message where brother Branham tells
[2:28:39] us we've come to the end of the second
[2:28:40] pool
[2:28:43] I may be wrong
[2:28:46] but I think it's in this message that
[2:28:47] brother Branham says that we have come
[2:28:50] to the end of the second pool the third
[2:28:51] pull is is at hand
[2:28:56] yes
[2:28:57] in this glorious message if you've not
[2:28:59] heard it I challenge you if you have
[2:29:01] heard it I challenge you
[2:29:03] to hear it again if you heard it
[2:29:05] yesterday I challenge you to listen to
[2:29:07] it again
[2:29:08] Christ is the mystery
[2:29:11] the mystery
[2:29:13] of God revealed
[2:29:17] this is the greatest mystery
[2:29:20] to know that Christ is the mystery of
[2:29:23] God revealed we didn't know that until
[2:29:25] God sent a prophet
[2:29:27] we didn't fully understand the Jehovah
[2:29:29] of the Old Testament was Jesus of the
[2:29:30] new anybody with me here am I pr am I
[2:29:33] preaching some false Doctrine here have
[2:29:34] I fallen off the wagon here and didn't
[2:29:36] know it
[2:29:39] but here's the greatest part it just
[2:29:41] keeps growing
[2:29:43] if Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[2:29:47] who is the mystery of Christ revealed
[2:29:51] who did Brother Branham say I'm I'm
[2:29:53] forerunning
[2:29:55] he said I'm for running the coming word
[2:29:57] so if if Christ is the mystery of God
[2:30:00] reveal the bride
[2:30:03] is the mystery of Christ revealed
[2:30:06] oh yes
[2:30:08] if Christ is God manifested in the Earth
[2:30:15] then who is the bride to be
[2:30:19] Jesus Christ The Living Word manifested
[2:30:22] in the earth same signs same wonders say
[2:30:26] miracles
[2:30:29] he even dealt a speaking in tongues amen
[2:30:36] which by the way is not a curse word
[2:30:42] Pentecost is not a swear word speaking
[2:30:44] in tongues is not a curse word I'm with
[2:30:47] Paul he said I speak in tongues more
[2:30:49] than you all
[2:30:51] to have a little Joy with his
[2:30:54] when you when you don't know how to pray
[2:30:57] when you know not how to pray as you
[2:30:58] should
[2:30:59] he the spirit doesn't make intercession
[2:31:01] for you
[2:31:02] you're never going to let me go let me
[2:31:04] let this go right out on the stream
[2:31:05] you're never going to talk us out of
[2:31:07] tongues you're never ever ever ever ever
[2:31:10] ever ever going to talk us out of that
[2:31:13] because we understand
[2:31:16] that it's for our day
[2:31:21] how many Church ages are there
[2:31:23] you're sure there's not eight
[2:31:28] are we still then somewhat in laodicea
[2:31:31] the bride is living a course in that
[2:31:33] little app over period we could call it
[2:31:34] the beginning of the bright age but
[2:31:36] isn't the church world out there still
[2:31:38] caught in laodicea there's no eighth
[2:31:40] messenger
[2:31:42] there's no eighth Church age
[2:31:46] wasn't the laodicean church age about
[2:31:49] the restoration of Pentecost wasn't it
[2:31:51] about the restoration of the gifts
[2:31:54] somebody said yes but didn't brother
[2:31:56] Brandon say when that which is perfect
[2:31:57] is coming the perfect is the word he
[2:31:59] said it but you know what else he said
[2:32:02] he said when that which is perfect is
[2:32:04] come his perfect love
[2:32:06] come on
[2:32:09] now I hear the word
[2:32:11] but I'm looking for the perfect love
[2:32:15] I'm still looking for it I see it when I
[2:32:17] look at Christ
[2:32:19] but when I look at my own life
[2:32:26] I still recognize at times
[2:32:29] and my love is prejudiced
[2:32:33] it's still easier for me to love someone
[2:32:36] whom I feel loves me
[2:32:41] you caught my work didn't you
[2:32:44] it's still easier at times
[2:32:46] to love to really love to deeply love
[2:32:49] when you know that someone loves you in
[2:32:51] return that's not perfect love
[2:32:55] I want to have such
[2:32:57] an outpouring a birth
[2:33:00] into the virtues of perfect love
[2:33:04] sister West you're sitting here would
[2:33:06] you hold up your hand
[2:33:09] her father-in-law brother Arnon West
[2:33:13] passed away
[2:33:15] and brother Billy Paul Branham
[2:33:17] came with brother borders is that right
[2:33:20] to the funeral
[2:33:22] brother Roy borders who was the founder
[2:33:25] of the spoken word that has become the
[2:33:26] voice of God
[2:33:28] and brother Billy Paul Branham the
[2:33:30] oldest son of brother Branham came to
[2:33:31] the funeral
[2:33:32] and he's speaking to them on the porches
[2:33:34] he's about to leave will you correct me
[2:33:36] if I say something wrong
[2:33:40] and he's emotional brother Billy Paul
[2:33:43] he's the most humble man
[2:33:46] that you could ever meet
[2:33:48] and when you hear people say about
[2:33:51] brother
[2:33:52] Branham
[2:33:54] that he had a gift of making you feel
[2:33:56] like you were the important one I never
[2:33:58] experienced that
[2:34:00] but I experienced that in brother Billy
[2:34:03] Paul
[2:34:05] brother Billy Paul said to me there in
[2:34:08] the Netherlands
[2:34:10] I met him at the
[2:34:12] at the southern gospel don't let me
[2:34:13] forget what I'm telling about sister
[2:34:15] West
[2:34:16] I met brother Billy Paul in Louisville
[2:34:19] Kentucky at the southern gospel singing
[2:34:22] convention
[2:34:25] they I kept running into Believers there
[2:34:28] and they kept saying to me brother Billy
[2:34:31] Paul is here brother Billy Paul is here
[2:34:32] brother Billy Paul's here and finally I
[2:34:33] ran into one who was a DJ of a radio
[2:34:36] station he said brother Billy Paul is
[2:34:38] here and he wants to meet you
[2:34:40] I said hi
[2:34:42] I don't know why brother Billy Paul want
[2:34:43] to meet me but I really want to meet him
[2:34:47] and he said well he said for me to bring
[2:34:49] you up to where they are
[2:34:51] and he's sitting up on the mezzanine and
[2:34:53] he and sister Lois are there and he'll
[2:34:55] bring her out my mom was with me and
[2:34:56] some other folks and
[2:34:58] we went up to to meet brother Billy Paul
[2:35:00] and I had an album in my hand a brother
[2:35:03] of the happy Goodman family
[2:35:07] that's where I practiced my high tenor
[2:35:10] parts
[2:35:12] I could see the excruciating look on
[2:35:14] some of your faces when I was hitting
[2:35:16] those tenor notes
[2:35:18] and I had that album there and that was
[2:35:19] when Vestal had all that hair on her
[2:35:21] head that wasn't all real
[2:35:24] but some of it was hers
[2:35:26] and I know that because I knew them
[2:35:30] and I had that old album they were
[2:35:33] selling old LP albums and I didn't even
[2:35:35] have a way to play it but I wanted it
[2:35:37] and I'm holding it there and brother
[2:35:39] Billy Paul comes out with sister Lois
[2:35:41] and introduces us and he said oh brother
[2:35:43] Shelley I've been listening to your
[2:35:44] singing tape
[2:35:47] and he said I enjoyed it so much
[2:35:50] he said they ought to have you up there
[2:35:52] singing instead of some of these
[2:35:54] boy I really went almost went through
[2:35:56] the floor
[2:35:58] he said them folks right there they sung
[2:36:00] at the Tabernacle
[2:36:02] I said the happy Goodman family sang at
[2:36:05] the Branham Tabernacle he said they sure
[2:36:06] did twice and I can remember
[2:36:09] and he said brother Branham he said they
[2:36:12] cut that off the tape but he said
[2:36:13] brother Branham comes to the pulpit and
[2:36:15] he says now that was real gospel singing
[2:36:21] that made me feel so good because I had
[2:36:24] come to believe from message people
[2:36:26] that music had to be mournful
[2:36:35] it's got to be a hundred years old
[2:36:40] anything after Fanny Crosby couldn't be
[2:36:42] anointed
[2:36:43] come on now and if we hadn't been
[2:36:46] singing it since the 50s the anointing
[2:36:48] couldn't possibly be on it
[2:36:52] I've sat through services like some of
[2:36:54] you where there wasn't you couldn't clap
[2:36:57] there was nothing sung fast enough to
[2:37:01] clap
[2:37:02] you're waiting for the beat
[2:37:04] and you realize there really is no beat
[2:37:06] he said oh yes Dad loved that kind of
[2:37:09] singing he really loved that kind of
[2:37:11] singing
[2:37:12] and I noticed as I continued to talk to
[2:37:15] brother
[2:37:16] Billy Paul
[2:37:18] that I began to feel like
[2:37:20] he was honored
[2:37:22] to be talking to me
[2:37:27] he said you know I want to thank you for
[2:37:29] the cassettes that you sent me he said I
[2:37:32] ordered them and you would let me pay
[2:37:34] for them and he said I gave them to the
[2:37:36] whole family at Christmas
[2:37:39] and he said they all they all have
[2:37:40] listened he said you know what my
[2:37:42] favorite song on that on your tape is I
[2:37:45] said I'm thinking to myself what would
[2:37:47] it be maybe it would be they're mending
[2:37:48] it again or the eagle you know something
[2:37:51] real messagy
[2:37:53] what did he say he said oh my favorite
[2:37:56] song on your album is the Holy Ghost
[2:37:57] will set your feet to dancing
[2:38:01] [Music]
[2:38:04] you can learn a lot can't you
[2:38:07] but I noticed as we went to leave his
[2:38:10] his uh uh eyes teared up
[2:38:15] and he was sad I said brother Billy Paul
[2:38:17] you've paid good money for these good
[2:38:19] tickets and we we need to go on and get
[2:38:21] out of the way and let you all enjoy the
[2:38:23] good singing in there and and it was
[2:38:26] hard to leave
[2:38:28] I wanted to leave because I wanted to
[2:38:30] leave him alone
[2:38:32] but he didn't want us to leave
[2:38:35] and I walked away and my mother said
[2:38:37] I've never felt more like a celebrity
[2:38:40] in all my life
[2:38:42] she said did you realize he treated us
[2:38:44] like we were stars
[2:38:47] and he was just an ordinary man which he
[2:38:49] was of course an ordinary man
[2:38:52] he said you pray for me don't you
[2:38:55] I said yes sir I pray for you often he
[2:38:58] said please don't forget to pray for me
[2:39:00] always I ran into him many years later
[2:39:03] in at the opening of the voice of God
[2:39:06] headquarters in the Netherlands
[2:39:08] I'd never met Brother Joseph
[2:39:11] it's a different experience
[2:39:14] than meeting brother Billy Paul
[2:39:17] and I'd never met Brother Joseph
[2:39:19] and we go into this place and I'm the
[2:39:22] odd bird
[2:39:23] as we got out of the car I could hear
[2:39:25] the people whispering that Shelly that's
[2:39:28] Shelly hey did you see Shelley
[2:39:31] what's he doing here
[2:39:32] well you know that don't really make you
[2:39:34] feel welcome does it
[2:39:37] but I just decided I had every right to
[2:39:39] be there if they did
[2:39:41] I just raised up my head and walked
[2:39:43] right in too
[2:39:46] we got in there and they were all
[2:39:47] crowded around brother Billy Paul all
[2:39:49] wanted to talk to him I'm telling this
[2:39:52] for some of these visitors that haven't
[2:39:53] heard it
[2:39:54] and uh
[2:39:56] they were all wanting to talk to him and
[2:39:58] I I just come in and I started trying to
[2:40:00] find a place to stand because it was
[2:40:02] very crowded in there a few people were
[2:40:04] with me your Daniel was with me sister
[2:40:06] Beverly
[2:40:07] and several others
[2:40:10] and
[2:40:11] all of a sudden brother Billy Paul not a
[2:40:13] real tall fella but he saw me
[2:40:17] through the crowd
[2:40:18] I'll never forget this it meant so much
[2:40:21] to me
[2:40:22] he said oh right over the Roaring of
[2:40:26] that crowd he said oh brother Shelley
[2:40:29] it's so good to see you he said come
[2:40:31] over here brother I want to hug your
[2:40:33] neck
[2:40:37] the crowd parted
[2:40:41] it was like the Red Sea
[2:40:46] and I walked in
[2:40:50] he grabbed me and give me the best bear
[2:40:54] hug and then I heard him say Well that's
[2:40:55] brother she
[2:40:59] isn't it amazing an hour before out
[2:41:02] there getting in trying to get in the
[2:41:03] building it was there Shelly what's he
[2:41:05] doing here but all of a sudden brother
[2:41:07] Billy Paul was glad to see me that's
[2:41:09] brother
[2:41:09] well he's from Alabama yeah yeah I've
[2:41:12] heard of him
[2:41:14] and he got real loud
[2:41:16] he got so loud that everybody in the
[2:41:19] room could hear what he was saying and
[2:41:21] he said I've been waiting on a chance
[2:41:25] to thank you brother shall
[2:41:28] for how you pray for me every day
[2:41:32] he said you know I was down in South
[2:41:34] America he told me the country I don't
[2:41:36] remember now he said I went out I ought
[2:41:39] not to done it but he said I went out
[2:41:41] before dinner and I was going to get a
[2:41:43] battery or something
[2:41:45] and he said they mugged me
[2:41:47] shot me with a stun gun and stole my
[2:41:50] watch
[2:41:51] he said and I nearly died
[2:41:55] he said laying there on that ground I
[2:41:58] nearly died before anybody even knew I
[2:42:01] was missing he said whatever that shock
[2:42:03] was it affected the rhythm of my heart
[2:42:06] and I could not get it to come back and
[2:42:08] he said the thought came to my mind
[2:42:12] I bet now he didn't mean bet
[2:42:15] I bet brother Shelley's praying for me
[2:42:20] he said just like that he's saying this
[2:42:23] loud
[2:42:26] and people are going oh
[2:42:31] I bet brother Shelley's praying for me
[2:42:34] and about that time one of his handlers
[2:42:36] said brother Billy Paul we've got to go
[2:42:38] brother Billy Paul we've got to go we
[2:42:39] got to go and there's people waiting on
[2:42:40] you there's people that have
[2:42:41] appointments for you he said oh no they
[2:42:43] can wait
[2:42:45] he said tell them they can wait he said
[2:42:47] I've promised brother Shelley years ago
[2:42:49] I would introduce him to Brother Joseph
[2:42:51] and he said that's exactly what I'm
[2:42:53] going to do
[2:42:55] now that's the kind of humble heart
[2:42:59] that brother Billy Paul had
[2:43:01] he's standing on the porch
[2:43:04] was it uh was it brother brother and
[2:43:07] sister West's home
[2:43:09] was it the place I visited one time on
[2:43:12] the highway or did they live somewhere
[2:43:13] else same place
[2:43:16] and he said oh
[2:43:22] I want to tell you something I wished I
[2:43:25] could tell you something is that right I
[2:43:28] really wished I could tell you something
[2:43:30] but he said I I promised daddy that I
[2:43:34] wouldn't tell it
[2:43:36] but he said
[2:43:38] it has to do
[2:43:41] with perfect love
[2:43:46] and that moment he was talking about
[2:43:48] being together again one day
[2:43:50] that's what inspired him
[2:43:53] losing brother Arnon West being together
[2:43:56] one day and then he said oh I I wished I
[2:43:59] could tell you something but I promised
[2:44:02] Daddy I wouldn't but it's it has to do
[2:44:04] did I leave anything out
[2:44:07] just remember
[2:44:10] perfect love
[2:44:13] well we know what perfect love somebody
[2:44:15] said what is it it's Jesus
[2:44:18] it's father forgive them
[2:44:24] for they know not what they do
[2:44:27] it's love without prejudice
[2:44:33] it's loving someone who is unlovable
[2:44:38] it's loving someone who plucks out your
[2:44:40] beard
[2:44:45] it's loving somebody who despitefully
[2:44:48] uses you and it's not that old phony
[2:44:50] love I love you anyway
[2:44:56] anybody ever had you that I love you all
[2:45:00] right but I'd sure like to fix you
[2:45:02] that's not love
[2:45:04] that's religion
[2:45:06] and when I realized when I I have had
[2:45:09] let me say this I don't know why I'm
[2:45:11] even doing this tonight
[2:45:14] but I realize that there have been times
[2:45:19] that he filled my heart he flooded my
[2:45:23] heart with a perfect love
[2:45:28] I remember a few times
[2:45:30] that he flooded my heart with pure
[2:45:32] compassion
[2:45:35] and I saw past the makeup
[2:45:39] in the bobbed hair
[2:45:41] and the ear bobs
[2:45:43] and I saw a woman in pain
[2:45:46] a woman who had
[2:45:49] bitterly opposed
[2:45:52] our ministry in Jerusalem
[2:45:56] but I didn't see her
[2:45:58] anymore in that moment it was him it
[2:46:00] wasn't me
[2:46:01] it wasn't me
[2:46:03] it was not me
[2:46:06] all of a sudden I saw her pain
[2:46:09] it was more than just a look on her face
[2:46:11] I saw I felt
[2:46:14] pain for her pain and love for her that
[2:46:17] she had never returned
[2:46:19] she had never shown me any love but all
[2:46:21] of a sudden I was overwhelmed with the
[2:46:24] perfect compassion and a perfect love
[2:46:25] and I thought to myself I must never
[2:46:27] step out of this I must never lose this
[2:46:32] but life is tough and circumstances are
[2:46:37] hard and
[2:46:43] Moses knew what to do
[2:46:46] he knew God said the word is in your
[2:46:48] mouth speak to it
[2:46:50] but he struck it anyway
[2:46:53] and I recognized so many times I've I've
[2:46:56] asked the Lord I don't believe it's
[2:46:58] something you can manufacture
[2:47:01] I've asked the Lord
[2:47:03] I want to love people like you love them
[2:47:06] and he's tested me a few times
[2:47:09] you heard me tell about going through
[2:47:11] some of my stuff and finding a gift that
[2:47:14] someone had given me that had later
[2:47:16] tried to destroy my life
[2:47:18] and I picked that gift up and I walked
[2:47:21] over to the trash can and I tossed it in
[2:47:23] and I thanked God to be rid of those
[2:47:25] people in my life
[2:47:27] thank God I don't have to deal with him
[2:47:29] anymore
[2:47:32] and he got me
[2:47:34] he said now you will go back
[2:47:37] and you'll take that out of the trash
[2:47:38] can
[2:47:41] and I went over there and I picked it up
[2:47:43] out of the trash can and if I would have
[2:47:45] dropped something I cared about it would
[2:47:47] have smashed to a thousand pieces
[2:47:49] but this thing was perfectly intact
[2:47:53] even though I
[2:47:57] had a little righteous indignation when
[2:47:59] I
[2:48:00] threw it away
[2:48:01] it was just perfect
[2:48:03] and I said Lord what must I do with this
[2:48:06] I don't even like it
[2:48:10] and all of a sudden it was like a movie
[2:48:11] on in my head I remembered how much I
[2:48:14] liked it when it was given to me
[2:48:17] now why didn't I like it now
[2:48:20] because I was prejudiced
[2:48:23] prejudiced anybody hear me
[2:48:26] I said what must I do with it I'm sure I
[2:48:28] can find a box for it
[2:48:30] after all it came out of a box I'm sure
[2:48:33] I can find a box for it and the Lord
[2:48:35] said um
[2:48:38] you will place it in a predominant spot
[2:48:41] on your desk
[2:48:45] and you will look at it every day
[2:48:48] until you can pray for them
[2:48:53] like I would pray for them
[2:48:59] wasn't easy
[2:49:01] there were times I would look at it and
[2:49:03] I'd go right down on my knees with a
[2:49:04] burden for those people there were times
[2:49:06] I looked at it and I thought hmm
[2:49:11] I have church people who love me that
[2:49:14] need my prayers
[2:49:16] those people would never think of me
[2:49:19] praying for them why should I pray for
[2:49:21] them they'll never even think of me
[2:49:23] praying for why should I waste my time
[2:49:27] praying for them
[2:49:28] and the Lord would take you right it was
[2:49:30] like you started over
[2:49:32] okay
[2:49:33] you must really like looking at it
[2:49:38] I remember the day
[2:49:41] I remember what I had on
[2:49:43] I remember what I had for lunch
[2:49:46] the day I walked into my office and I
[2:49:48] saw that there and my compassion and my
[2:49:52] love for them was beyond me
[2:49:56] I fell down on my knees and I prayed and
[2:49:59] when I got through praying the Lord said
[2:50:01] now I had you to pray for them because
[2:50:02] nobody else was
[2:50:10] I know this I know what it means to
[2:50:12] struggle with prejudice
[2:50:14] you see my problem is not racial
[2:50:18] that's not the kind of prejudice I'm
[2:50:20] talking about I'm talking about
[2:50:21] remembering or wrong
[2:50:27] until we can have that kind of
[2:50:31] birth explosion
[2:50:34] perfect love filling us
[2:50:37] we can pray for one another without
[2:50:40] prejudice look folks uh uh get him Lord
[2:50:44] is not a qualified prayer
[2:50:51] it's the one who
[2:50:53] just how to draw
[2:50:55] it's up to you and I to let him fill our
[2:50:57] hearts with that perfect love I truly
[2:50:59] believe
[2:51:00] as brother Branham has told us it's
[2:51:03] going to take that perfect love
[2:51:05] to make the rapture
[2:51:09] so
[2:51:12] the word has come
[2:51:14] and the Word was perfect
[2:51:16] but I have the quotes where brother
[2:51:17] Brandon said that which is perfect
[2:51:19] it's perfect love
[2:51:22] and I don't believe that that perfect
[2:51:23] love is predominant in our life I know
[2:51:26] it's not let me just judge me
[2:51:28] it's not predominant in my life
[2:51:31] and I I've got to have it
[2:51:33] when you hear me cry out we've got to
[2:51:36] have you we do we've got to have him
[2:51:38] we've got to have the Holy Ghost we've
[2:51:41] got to have a hymn we've got to have the
[2:51:43] attributes
[2:51:45] we're being birthed from one virtue to
[2:51:48] an a it's not easy I mean excuse me it's
[2:51:50] not difficult to love somebody who loves
[2:51:52] you back
[2:51:54] you're not being tested to love somebody
[2:51:56] who's good to you the test is being able
[2:51:59] to love someone who despitefully uses
[2:52:03] you and wants to see you destroyed
[2:52:06] and yet you can pray for them because
[2:52:08] you see them as a soul that needs to
[2:52:11] come home to Christ
[2:52:13] let's have the musicians to come
[2:52:16] boy it's late
[2:52:20] it's the word coming of Christ
[2:52:23] it's the living Christ The Living Word
[2:52:25] coming into his bride
[2:52:27] it's we must take the book John typed
[2:52:30] the bride John had to take the book and
[2:52:33] chew it up you and I must eat this
[2:52:35] Living Word
[2:52:37] we eat the Living Word by by eating how
[2:52:40] it is identified it's identified in the
[2:52:42] message of the hour it's identified in
[2:52:44] the written record of God's word we've
[2:52:47] got to hide ourselves in the Bible
[2:52:49] we've got to hide ourselves in the tapes
[2:52:51] and the sermons in the messages
[2:52:55] not just our favorite preacher
[2:52:59] we've got to get in that
[2:53:02] so that everything promised there can be
[2:53:04] birthed and formed in US
[2:53:07] then we can say okay we don't need gifts
[2:53:09] anymore we don't need tongues anymore of
[2:53:11] course that's the rapture
[2:53:14] but until then
[2:53:16] that press play and Obey people
[2:53:19] who don't think we need the fivefold
[2:53:21] ministry the Bible says we do
[2:53:23] the Bible says we're going to need them
[2:53:25] until we all come to the unity of the
[2:53:27] faith until we all come to that stature
[2:53:29] of a perfect man we're going to need the
[2:53:31] fivefold ministry if every preacher
[2:53:33] preached just a light we'd never have
[2:53:34] any Perfection going on Among Us it
[2:53:37] takes every you can't bottle your
[2:53:39] ministry after somebody else's Ministry
[2:53:44] they tried
[2:53:46] they petted me on the head 30 years ago
[2:53:49] can I pet you on top of your head
[2:53:51] embedded me on top of my head 30 years
[2:53:53] ago and said he'll come down he's new to
[2:53:55] the message
[2:53:58] he's new to it now but he'll calm down
[2:54:00] why would you want to calm down I've
[2:54:03] seen what death produces more death
[2:54:06] I've seen what lifeless religion
[2:54:08] produces why would you want any more of
[2:54:10] that we've got to have more of him
[2:54:13] [Applause]
[2:54:18] there's a man in here to this evening
[2:54:20] who was testifying I'm not going to
[2:54:22] identify him but he was testifying to me
[2:54:25] today about all the times the enemy had
[2:54:28] tried to destroy him
[2:54:31] destroying his mind
[2:54:33] and how religion had failed him
[2:54:36] legalism and Rule keeping had failed him
[2:54:40] and how he finally had that birth
[2:54:42] experience
[2:54:44] if for no other reason you and I have to
[2:54:47] keep pressing in so that we can find
[2:54:49] someone else like that brother
[2:54:52] who still held in a bondage somewhere
[2:54:54] who doesn't know what it means to be
[2:54:56] free and to be totally delivered
[2:54:59] this bride has to manifest Jesus because
[2:55:02] there are more people out there who
[2:55:04] don't know the freedom that the word can
[2:55:06] produce in our life and they're not
[2:55:08] going to know it until we produce it
[2:55:11] we can't just talk about it we've got to
[2:55:13] go in that tent and come out like him
[2:55:17] am I telling you the truth this evening
[2:55:20] let's stand I I uh I think I apologize
[2:55:28] I think I do
[2:55:41] Lord I'm hungry for you
[2:55:45] Jesus we are so hungry for you
[2:55:51] when we think we know so much
[2:55:54] we know so little
[2:56:05] if somebody would have told me 30 years
[2:56:07] ago
[2:56:09] I'd still be struggling to laugh
[2:56:15] I would have never been able to believe
[2:56:17] it
[2:56:21] yet here we are
[2:56:25] somebody right now in this house is
[2:56:27] thinking how can that man be so
[2:56:29] transparent
[2:56:31] because that is the only way
[2:56:36] to grow
[2:56:39] we have to be honest
[2:56:42] and transparent with one another
[2:56:45] we're fighting the same great battle
[2:56:49] Lord we're so ready to win this mind
[2:56:52] battle in Christ
[2:56:54] we're so ready to manifest every virtue
[2:56:57] and
[2:56:58] to operate in that perfect love so that
[2:57:01] when we recognize who we are we can
[2:57:04] speak
[2:57:05] and that creative spoken word comes out
[2:57:08] of our mouth
[2:57:10] and missing limbs are restored as your
[2:57:14] Prophet told us this bride's Revival
[2:57:17] would produce
[2:57:19] the restoration of missing limbs
[2:57:24] he also told us that it would produce
[2:57:26] ananiasis and sapphiras
[2:57:30] because in that day you the you would
[2:57:33] not tolerate lying to the Holy Ghost
[2:57:39] as fearful as that may seem
[2:57:43] we'd rather have that full manifestation
[2:57:46] of who you are among us
[2:57:48] than to continue to play Church
[2:57:51] Lord we don't want to be found playing
[2:57:55] Church
[2:57:58] you didn't deliver us out of
[2:58:00] denominations
[2:58:03] to die on the vine
[2:58:05] to go through the motions
[2:58:08] And the emotions
[2:58:11] and miss the mark
[2:58:13] so we as a body are crying out to you
[2:58:16] tonight to come and fill us with who you
[2:58:19] are
[2:58:21] we confess before you our weaknesses and
[2:58:25] our failures
[2:58:26] and our slacknesses and where we need to
[2:58:29] measure up
[2:58:31] and we do it without any condemnation
[2:58:35] because we know that we're not
[2:58:37] qualifying ourselves
[2:58:39] it's you who justifies it's you who
[2:58:43] qualifies us
[2:58:45] so we can just pour out our heart we can
[2:58:48] just tell you what's going on in our
[2:58:50] lives knowing that you are not there to
[2:58:53] condemn
[2:58:55] rather you convict us and fill us with
[2:58:59] such hope
[2:59:01] that this bride her greatest days
[2:59:05] are not behind us as some predict
[2:59:09] but are ahead of us
[2:59:12] as we become so desperate and so hungry
[2:59:16] to Manifest this Living Word Isha
[2:59:20] or abandon
[2:59:24] foreign
[2:59:31] Spirit of the Living God
[2:59:35] we want you Jesus

[2:59:46] just a few moments but I want to ask you
[2:59:48] if you're here
[2:59:50] in the time we have left together if
[2:59:52] you're here and any of this has spoken
[2:59:54] to your heart
[2:59:56] if you are able to to relate to it
[2:59:59] and your heart is somehow crying out for
[3:00:02] what we're talking about here
[3:00:04] I want you to come and join me and stand
[3:00:06] if you must kneel you can you're free to
[3:00:08] but we'll have more room if you come and

[3:00:35] of the crop

[3:01:37] the morning

[3:01:42] if there's something you need to roll
[3:01:44] off on him his shoulder is strong enough
[3:01:48] to carry it
