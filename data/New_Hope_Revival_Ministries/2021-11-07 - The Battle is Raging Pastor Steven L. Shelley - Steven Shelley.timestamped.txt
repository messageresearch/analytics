[48:44] and they're just waiting for us to lean
[48:47] into a negative situation
[48:50] to be able to grab it from us but oh if
[48:53] we could rather lean into the lord and
[48:56] lean into his promises because he has
[48:59] said i'll never leave you and i'll never
[49:02] forsake you i'm with you always even to
[49:06] the end of the world

[49:22] when faith kicks in you say lord i'm
[49:26] trusting to your unseen hand because i
[49:29] don't know what is in front of me i
[49:31] can't see it i don't know what it is but
[49:34] i'm walking in faith
[49:36] being guided by the holy spirit
[49:40] amen
[49:41] we bless you today for giving of your
[49:43] tithe and offering and we have made
[49:46] known that the first sunday of each
[49:48] month we are receiving a special
[49:50] offering on the principle of the loan
[49:54] the mortgage of this property we started
[49:56] back in june
[49:58] uh
[49:59] at a word from the lord that we needed
[50:02] to put forth a concentrated effort to
[50:05] get rid of this debt that was on this
[50:07] piece of property so that we could
[50:09] really concentrate on what the lord
[50:12] wanted to do
[50:13] with this property and so
[50:16] we're here today to
[50:18] do that
[50:19] we're standing right now
[50:22] i believe you were given three dollars
[50:24] on tuesday night so we can say 141
[50:28] 000 dollars has been given toward this
[50:31] debt already and we're just giving god
[50:34] all the praise
[50:39] as i begin to think about this offering
[50:41] today uh there was a scripture that came
[50:44] to me and that was be not weary
[50:46] in well-doing
[50:48] for in due season
[50:50] you'll reap
[50:51] if you faint not
[50:54] be not weary in well-doing that's not
[50:56] just about this offering that's in
[50:58] whatever you've put your hand to for the
[51:00] lord
[51:01] because there's many times that it
[51:03] doesn't look like things are going
[51:04] anywhere
[51:06] it looks like maybe you're in a holding
[51:08] pattern but be not weary in well-doing
[51:13] for in due season
[51:16] i'm glad my lord has a due season for me
[51:19] in due season you'll reap
[51:21] if you faint not

[57:37] you may be seated again this morning
[57:39] it's wonderful
[57:41] to see you in the house of the lord
[57:44] we're so delighted you're here and we're
[57:46] so thankful for every person
[57:48] who's streaming this service today
[57:51] we believe god has an appointment with
[57:53] us
[57:54] i said we believe god has an appointment
[57:56] with us
[57:57] hallelujah hallelujah
[58:01] i was just thinking as brother greeley
[58:03] was
[58:04] mentioning the principle there's a
[58:06] little bit of me
[58:08] every time we have to do it we're
[58:10] delighted for what god is doing
[58:13] but there's a little bit of me that
[58:14] feels embarrassed every time we take
[58:16] this offering
[58:18] and i think there are some things that
[58:19] sometimes people forget along the way
[58:23] and
[58:23] one of those things is we had a great
[58:25] crisis to overcome some years ago we did
[58:28] it by the blood of the lamb
[58:30] we are leasing an apartment in jerusalem
[58:34] for for a while we're releasing two
[58:35] apartments now we're leasing one
[58:37] apartment
[58:38] in jerusalem and that is very costly and
[58:41] we've been doing that very faithfully
[58:43] for all of these years god has made a
[58:46] way so a lot of finances have gone in
[58:48] that direction and by the time every
[58:51] piece of equipment and cord and light
[58:54] and battery
[58:55] and play-out system and everything was
[58:58] purchased for the studio there
[59:01] we were right at 150 000
[59:05] paid most of that by cash by offering
[59:08] not having to put a whole lot of that in
[59:11] in a charge or anything so you know it's
[59:14] not like
[59:15] god hasn't been so good to us
[59:18] through these years
[59:20] and sister flo had been telling us a
[59:22] long time that god had been dealing with
[59:25] her and she wanted us to build a box
[59:28] and she just said i want i want a box
[59:31] built i want you to put that in the
[59:33] don't you be embarrassed sister flo
[59:36] uh
[59:37] i want that box built i want that box
[59:39] put out there in that vestibule and i
[59:41] won't ever want people to give toward
[59:43] the principle of that loan to to get
[59:46] this property
[59:48] all these 60 acres and church building
[59:50] and everything paid off and she said
[59:52] then you wouldn't have to mention it you
[59:54] just tell everybody from time to time go
[59:56] to that box well we didn't get that box
[59:58] built and god began to really deal with
[1:00:01] brother greeley and i believe it was
[1:00:02] march
[1:00:03] you said june and i believe it was march
[1:00:06] and uh
[1:00:07] it's very rare that i get to correct you
[1:00:10] on anything like that
[1:00:12] march the 7th because he's usually the
[1:00:15] one that gets it right and i don't but
[1:00:18] uh god really began to deal with him and
[1:00:20] if it wasn't the lord
[1:00:22] then why in the world is he blessing it
[1:00:25] like he is blessing it
[1:00:27] it has been an absolute joy every week
[1:00:32] every week
[1:00:34] now it's it's not nearly as much as when
[1:00:37] we concentrate on that first sunday like
[1:00:39] the lord gave him the strategy and i'm
[1:00:41] with it 100
[1:00:43] not putting it on him but i want him to
[1:00:45] have the credit for hearing from the
[1:00:47] lord
[1:00:48] on that and it's a joy to watch it every
[1:00:51] week and i know people come through and
[1:00:53] there's visitors and streamers and i
[1:00:55] wish they wouldn't put so much emphasis
[1:00:57] listen you you do you
[1:01:01] you do you
[1:01:03] i'm like brother jackson said don't tell
[1:01:05] me how they do it at your church
[1:01:08] when you're sitting at mine
[1:01:12] when you're streaming our service don't
[1:01:14] tell us how they do it at your service
[1:01:16] you can you either just forget about it
[1:01:18] and don't let it worry you
[1:01:20] or just get on in
[1:01:22] here oh i found something brother
[1:01:25] branham said this week about the drum
[1:01:27] that i'd never heard him say before
[1:01:30] but i'm i'm not going into that this
[1:01:32] morning but it sure did encourage my
[1:01:34] heart
[1:01:36] and
[1:01:37] you know sometimes we stir up things not
[1:01:40] sometime all the time
[1:01:42] we stir up things
[1:01:44] now let me just give you uh a brief
[1:01:46] report and then i'm gonna sing a song
[1:01:48] that sister megan asked me to sing in
[1:01:50] honor of her sister
[1:01:52] without a miracle i guess she's slipping
[1:01:55] away very fast
[1:01:57] and she has fought a brave fight for
[1:02:00] many many
[1:02:01] many
[1:02:02] years
[1:02:04] i mean she has been through so
[1:02:07] many
[1:02:08] real physical attacks in her body for
[1:02:11] over 20 years
[1:02:13] and god's brought her through every time
[1:02:16] and she has streamed
[1:02:18] services many times
[1:02:21] and uh i'm not supposed to mention but
[1:02:23] she has been faithful to support the
[1:02:26] work of the lord
[1:02:27] even though she was not physically able
[1:02:29] to be here from oregon
[1:02:31] her heart has been behind what was
[1:02:34] happening here
[1:02:35] and she is without a miracle now you
[1:02:38] know we don't know what the lord will do
[1:02:40] but it certainly looks like that she is
[1:02:43] about to find out
[1:02:45] that it's more real
[1:02:48] than what she ever dreamed it could be
[1:02:51] she's got a dear mother
[1:02:53] a waiting on her and other precious
[1:02:55] loved ones waiting on her
[1:02:58] and uh
[1:02:59] well if you thought about it you could
[1:03:01] be a little jealous actually you could
[1:03:02] be because her suffering if nothing else
[1:03:05] the pain and suffering is over and then
[1:03:07] she gets to step into all of that
[1:03:10] so i'm going to sing a song in just a
[1:03:11] minute in honor of that and because we
[1:03:14] believe that god has given her a lot of
[1:03:16] grace through her life
[1:03:18] but i want to mention brother curry
[1:03:22] i want you all to know that the lord is
[1:03:23] doing something
[1:03:25] i don't know what to call it
[1:03:28] i don't know how to define it or
[1:03:30] classify it or
[1:03:32] explain it away
[1:03:34] but he is experiencing a miraculous
[1:03:38] touch of god
[1:03:40] in his body
[1:03:43] he really is
[1:03:46] he really is
[1:03:47] [Applause]
[1:03:51] there's no doubt about it i have
[1:03:52] pictures to prove
[1:03:56] there's flesh
[1:03:58] that's coming back on his bones
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:02] for those of you who have asked it could
[1:04:04] it be swelling no it's not swelling
[1:04:07] he's dehydrated
[1:04:10] there's no buildup of fluid in his body
[1:04:12] at all
[1:04:13] they're giving him fluid just now
[1:04:15] for the first time
[1:04:17] since he's been home for two weeks where
[1:04:19] he was sent home to die
[1:04:21] immediately
[1:04:23] because they said every uh
[1:04:28] i don't want to say requirement but
[1:04:29] everything that would cause sepsis is
[1:04:32] present
[1:04:35] his bowel is perforated
[1:04:39] it's spilling his waist into an open
[1:04:41] cavity
[1:04:43] he does not yet have a fever but it's
[1:04:46] just a matter of time before the sepsis
[1:04:48] sets in
[1:04:50] the flesh over a period of six years and
[1:04:53] all of the treatments
[1:04:56] and
[1:04:57] gaining a little and losing more and
[1:04:59] gaining just a little bit losing more
[1:05:01] he was
[1:05:02] skin and bones
[1:05:05] and
[1:05:06] there were places this is kind of plain
[1:05:09] talk
[1:05:10] there were places in his anatomy that
[1:05:12] were concave
[1:05:15] you could put your fist in there
[1:05:17] if you wanted to because there was so
[1:05:20] much
[1:05:21] that had changed in his physical body so
[1:05:23] many
[1:05:24] tubes so many
[1:05:26] i don't want to say cords i don't guess
[1:05:28] he's plugged in but
[1:05:30] so many
[1:05:32] kidney drains and everything just
[1:05:34] unbelievable
[1:05:36] and therefore it left places concave
[1:05:40] in his body that should be smooth
[1:05:42] and those concave places have filled out
[1:05:45] in the last two weeks
[1:05:47] i have pictures of his arms a week ago
[1:05:50] and pictures of his arms today and you
[1:05:53] can see the flesh coming back on the
[1:05:54] bone
[1:05:56] when my wife and i and benjamin visited
[1:05:59] him tomorrow will be two weeks ago in
[1:06:01] the hospital
[1:06:02] uh his hair was almost gray it was gray
[1:06:06] there was a hint of red but it was
[1:06:08] mostly gray and today his hair is mostly
[1:06:12] flaming red
[1:06:14] orange red
[1:06:17] now i'm not sure how that hair can do
[1:06:19] that
[1:06:23] because it seems to me like it would
[1:06:25] take
[1:06:26] new hair growing in but the red hair is
[1:06:29] as long as the gray hair god is doing
[1:06:32] something
[1:06:35] now the truth is
[1:06:37] uh god is either healing and restoring
[1:06:39] him to take him
[1:06:41] because he doesn't want his name to be
[1:06:44] you know maligned here in the earth and
[1:06:47] he wants to show whoever would like to
[1:06:49] see i am a healer and i'm a restorer
[1:06:53] and somebody doesn't have to waste a way
[1:06:55] to die and then everybody say it was my
[1:06:57] will
[1:06:58] or he's about to raise him up to pastor
[1:07:01] his church
[1:07:03] we just don't know what god has
[1:07:07] and
[1:07:10] either way it's a miracle
[1:07:15] i didn't give them these pictures
[1:07:16] because some of them we couldn't
[1:07:18] possibly show
[1:07:20] he may be streaming he doesn't even know
[1:07:22] i have them so i better be we better be
[1:07:24] careful what we say here
[1:07:27] because he's still feisty
[1:07:30] it comes with that red hair
[1:07:34] i don't know if you can see it
[1:07:39] anybody see that
[1:07:41] now you all didn't see him maybe like we
[1:07:43] did on monday at the hospital can you
[1:07:45] all see how red it's almost orange red
[1:07:49] can anybody see that
[1:07:52] hair is coming back on his body his arms
[1:07:55] and legs
[1:07:56] where there's been no hair
[1:07:58] [Applause]
[1:08:07] where his because of all those
[1:08:09] treatments and everything he's been
[1:08:10] through which changes your chemistry and
[1:08:13] your hormones and everything has changed
[1:08:15] by all those chemicals
[1:08:17] and so his hair his skin was smooth and
[1:08:20] he did not have body hair and i can show
[1:08:22] you pictures now his arms covered with
[1:08:25] hair his legs covered with hair
[1:08:28] something is happening
[1:08:31] god's doing something
[1:08:33] and the they don't know what the nurses
[1:08:35] don't know what to think
[1:08:37] the cancer hospital doesn't know what to
[1:08:39] think about what's going on
[1:08:42] and uh so we should you know i'm we try
[1:08:44] to be careful what we say how we say
[1:08:47] we want to give god lots of glory for
[1:08:50] what he's doing
[1:08:52] we don't want to declare that he's going
[1:08:54] to live forever because i'm not
[1:08:58] but we know that god is doing something
[1:09:02] and i was on the phone again this
[1:09:03] morning with sister anita and she
[1:09:05] referred me to the prophecy that was
[1:09:07] given over them originally
[1:09:09] six years ago when this battle was
[1:09:11] raging in the beginning
[1:09:13] and there was a line in there i'm not
[1:09:15] prepared to read it to you this morning
[1:09:17] but there yet but there was a line in
[1:09:19] there that talks about god performing a
[1:09:22] miracle that would take him back to his
[1:09:24] youth
[1:09:25] i don't know what that was
[1:09:28] i don't know what that was i don't know
[1:09:30] what is happening but i know that it is
[1:09:33] it is not supposed to happen like this
[1:09:37] in the natural the the hospice
[1:09:42] you understand hospice is end-of-life
[1:09:44] treatment
[1:09:46] so now there now there's a battle going
[1:09:48] on because
[1:09:50] she wanted to make sure that he had
[1:09:51] fluids
[1:09:54] so now she's up against the system
[1:09:57] but i want you to know she's he's
[1:09:59] getting fluids today
[1:10:02] sometimes you just have to make a stand
[1:10:06] now i know some of you are not uh minded
[1:10:09] this way
[1:10:10] but there is a lot of witchcraft
[1:10:15] you would be shocked
[1:10:17] at how much witchcraft is coming against
[1:10:19] them
[1:10:20] and what has really increased against us
[1:10:23] as well
[1:10:24] and some of it started when we started
[1:10:27] opening up the stream
[1:10:29] because you may have all good intention
[1:10:32] but you need to know there are people
[1:10:33] out there that don't have good intention
[1:10:37] and they're looking for something to
[1:10:39] latch on to
[1:10:41] we just had one little one little
[1:10:43] comment this week
[1:10:44] uh i can't say what it was but very very
[1:10:48] filthy ex
[1:10:50] filthy filthy language
[1:10:52] uh cursing you
[1:10:55] your god your jesus your church
[1:10:59] and you think sometimes people are just
[1:11:01] in rebellion and angry like that and
[1:11:03] they get come across some but sometimes
[1:11:05] it's really a spiritual battle
[1:11:08] and there's witchcraft that goes behind
[1:11:10] it and so we need to cover one another
[1:11:13] in prayer we need to pray cover that
[1:11:16] family in prayer
[1:11:17] and if i told you some of the things
[1:11:19] that we have been involved with in the
[1:11:22] last three days
[1:11:24] some of you would not be able to get a
[1:11:27] hold of it
[1:11:28] it's that it's that out there
[1:11:31] but i want you to know there is a you
[1:11:33] have a destiny
[1:11:35] and satan doesn't want you to fulfill
[1:11:37] your
[1:11:38] destiny and so there's a lot of foul
[1:11:42] spirits that operate we have become a
[1:11:45] people it seems that don't understand
[1:11:48] that our enemy is not
[1:11:50] people
[1:11:51] our enemy is a spirit
[1:11:55] and we're going to talk about that in
[1:11:57] just a minute
[1:11:58] because i'm going to preach a message
[1:12:00] this morning the battle is raging
[1:12:03] and it is it's raging
[1:12:05] but guess what
[1:12:07] [Applause]
[1:12:12] hallelujah
[1:12:15] oh
[1:12:16] jesus is the victor
[1:12:19] the lord gave me this song many many
[1:12:22] years ago
[1:12:28] we sing this
[1:12:30] in honor
[1:12:32] of a life
[1:12:34] it's about to make heaven her home
[1:12:38] i was
[1:12:39] standing on
[1:12:41] a mountain
[1:12:45] looking
[1:12:47] toward
[1:12:48] the sky
[1:12:51] when i saw
[1:12:53] a storm
[1:12:55] approaching
[1:12:57] and i feared
[1:12:59] that i would die
[1:13:04] i
[1:13:05] saw god's creatures
[1:13:08] run and see
[1:13:11] a better
[1:13:13] place to hide
[1:13:19] [Music]
[1:13:30] and cried
[1:13:36] now the clouds were moving
[1:13:41] faster
[1:13:44] and the lightning was
[1:13:46] flashing bright
[1:13:50] and the clouds grew so dark they hit the
[1:13:54] light of the sun
[1:13:57] and it seemed
[1:13:59] that it was
[1:14:02] night when all at once
[1:14:07] there was a feeling
[1:14:10] like i'd never had
[1:14:14] before
[1:14:15] [Music]
[1:14:17] up above
[1:14:19] the storm
[1:14:20] you should have heard me sing
[1:14:24] god had given me

[1:16:50] old valley

[1:20:58] leader

[1:21:06] god bless you all
[1:21:09] ephesians chapter 6
[1:21:12] beginning in verse 10
[1:21:15] this thursday november the 11th is
[1:21:18] veterans day
[1:21:20] it's not memorial day
[1:21:22] to only remember those who have died in
[1:21:25] the service of their country but
[1:21:28] veterans day to remember all who have
[1:21:31] served
[1:21:32] in the service of their country
[1:21:35] may god
[1:21:36] honor their memory if they have gone on
[1:21:39] and may strengthen them and provide for
[1:21:42] them
[1:21:43] many times my heart goes out to those
[1:21:46] vietnam vets
[1:21:48] who have certainly lived their lives
[1:21:51] were for many of them their lives were
[1:21:53] forever
[1:21:54] changed by the most unpopular war that
[1:21:58] the united states has ever been involved
[1:22:00] in
[1:22:01] and many of them to this day remain
[1:22:04] homeless
[1:22:05] with mental illness
[1:22:07] with not enough provision and someone
[1:22:10] said well it's available to them
[1:22:13] and in many cases it is but their
[1:22:15] condition their emotional brokenness
[1:22:18] sometimes keeps them from getting from
[1:22:21] reaching out there they're certainly
[1:22:24] paranoid and afraid
[1:22:26] and so i pray for them when this kind of
[1:22:29] thing comes to my mind and any of you
[1:22:31] that are here any of you that are
[1:22:33] streaming this service
[1:22:35] and you have served our country in any
[1:22:37] way god bless you
[1:22:40] thank you for your service
[1:22:42] and today we say goodbye for
[1:22:45] uh three months and then we'll hope to
[1:22:47] see him a few days in three more months
[1:22:50] of training as jesse uh goes off
[1:22:53] and uh we've made it very clear that
[1:22:56] this was not any of our desire for him
[1:23:00] we would have kept him here all along
[1:23:03] but he had this desire and so we love
[1:23:06] him and we pray for him and we support
[1:23:08] him and we celebrate him and our prayer
[1:23:12] is that you will never ever have to
[1:23:14] serve one day
[1:23:16] in in a real dangerous place that god
[1:23:19] will spare you that because we love you
[1:23:22] so much
[1:23:23] and we wouldn't want that for you but
[1:23:25] everyone who goes that way knows that
[1:23:27] you are certainly taking that as a risk
[1:23:31] and so his bravery today should
[1:23:33] certainly be mentioned may god bless him
[1:23:35] any of the rest of you who have that
[1:23:37] kind of an idea forget it
[1:23:43] you're called to a higher army
[1:23:46] you have a higher responsibility
[1:23:49] you're you're you are called to defend a
[1:23:51] truth a gospel a person
[1:23:54] and god will always provide he will
[1:23:57] always make a way
[1:23:59] and there's coming a day that no army
[1:24:02] and no no marine corp and no air force
[1:24:05] and no navy
[1:24:06] is going to be able to protect this
[1:24:09] nation from what she has asked for
[1:24:12] so we pray about that as well don't we
[1:24:15] on that same day november the 11th
[1:24:17] sister hoyer's birthday
[1:24:20] and she will be 101 years old
[1:24:23] in her lifetime can you imagine being
[1:24:26] born in 1920
[1:24:28] her life has spanned 101 years and she
[1:24:32] has seen many many hardships
[1:24:36] including wars
[1:24:38] and her husband our precious brother
[1:24:40] hoyer went home to be with the lord many
[1:24:43] years ago and she has fought alone so
[1:24:46] may god bless her and those who helped
[1:24:48] care for her
[1:24:49] sister miriam and those and amelia has a
[1:24:52] birthday the same day
[1:24:54] and so where is she is she in here
[1:24:56] millie
[1:24:58] how many years are you going to
[1:25:00] celebrate
[1:25:02] six
[1:25:03] six years old happy birthday to you god
[1:25:05] bless you
[1:25:06] [Applause]
[1:25:09] i don't know if jonathan hollis is
[1:25:11] streaming this morning but he has a
[1:25:13] birthday that day and for many many
[1:25:15] years
[1:25:16] we celebrated brother tremaine's
[1:25:18] birthday on november the 11th until he
[1:25:20] went home to be with the lord and their
[1:25:22] wedding anniversary so that's always
[1:25:25] been an important day around here
[1:25:27] ephesians 6 and 10 finally my brethren
[1:25:31] be strong in the lord and in the power
[1:25:34] of his might i don't have any new
[1:25:36] scriptures to give
[1:25:40] but how many of you know they can all be
[1:25:41] new
[1:25:43] when the holy ghost is on them
[1:25:45] put on the whole armor of god
[1:25:48] that you may be able to stand against
[1:25:51] the wiles
[1:25:53] of the devil
[1:25:55] for we wrestle not
[1:25:58] against flesh and blood
[1:26:01] but against principalities
[1:26:03] against powers
[1:26:06] against the rulers of the darkness of
[1:26:08] this world
[1:26:10] against spiritual wickedness
[1:26:14] in
[1:26:15] high
[1:26:16] places
[1:26:17] you might say pastor i'm not in much of
[1:26:20] a battle it seems
[1:26:22] i don't really know what folk are
[1:26:24] talking about
[1:26:26] my life is relatively calm
[1:26:28] well i want you to know that that is the
[1:26:31] most dangerous place to be in today
[1:26:34] because if there's a target on your back
[1:26:37] it means that you've been bought with
[1:26:39] the price
[1:26:41] sealed by the precious blood of jesus
[1:26:43] christ and the old preacher used to say
[1:26:46] he's not fighting you it's because he's
[1:26:47] got you
[1:26:50] so i'll just leave you with that brother
[1:26:52] branham said something very similar
[1:26:54] ii timothy chapter 2 while you're still
[1:26:56] standing
[1:26:58] verse 3 and 4
[1:27:02] thou therefore endure hardness
[1:27:05] as a good soldier
[1:27:08] of jesus christ
[1:27:10] there's gonna be some hard times
[1:27:13] there's gonna be some rough places
[1:27:17] sometimes the rough places are going to
[1:27:19] be more
[1:27:20] than the smooth places
[1:27:22] there is no place to run except into the
[1:27:25] strong arms
[1:27:26] of the lord jesus christ
[1:27:29] there is no retirement in this war
[1:27:32] there's no discharge in the army of the
[1:27:34] lord
[1:27:35] and so once you recognize that you are
[1:27:38] called to his service
[1:27:40] you must therefore endure hardness
[1:27:44] as a good soldier of jesus christ it's
[1:27:47] not the one that starts
[1:27:49] it's the one who finishes the course
[1:27:53] amen
[1:27:54] endure it's he that endureth till the
[1:27:57] end
[1:27:58] the same shall be saved and now the next
[1:28:01] verse no man that wareth
[1:28:04] entangleth himself
[1:28:06] with the affairs of this life
[1:28:09] that he may please him who hath chosen
[1:28:13] him to be a soldier
[1:28:16] jesse is about to experience a different
[1:28:19] kind of life
[1:28:21] especially as he goes through training
[1:28:25] there's going to be some things that he
[1:28:27] and i you and i and he take for granted
[1:28:30] that he will uh temporarily have
[1:28:33] suspended from his life
[1:28:35] he won't eat when he wants to eat and
[1:28:37] sleep when he wants to sleep and as long
[1:28:39] as he would like to sleep for as brother
[1:28:42] jackson told him you were you really in
[1:28:45] the natural become the property of the
[1:28:47] united states of america for a period of
[1:28:50] time
[1:28:51] you don't get to pop on facebook or
[1:28:54] instagram when you get ready you don't
[1:28:56] get to call home when you're ready there
[1:28:58] is a there is a provision made for all
[1:29:01] these things but not according to your
[1:29:03] will your desire
[1:29:05] you have to do like you're told to do
[1:29:09] and there are people who won't make it
[1:29:11] through those first first little
[1:29:14] you know pains
[1:29:15] but there will be those who determine in
[1:29:18] them in their mind i'm going all the way
[1:29:21] ain't nobody going to say i didn't do my
[1:29:23] best
[1:29:25] and it's the same way in the army of the
[1:29:26] lord
[1:29:27] you cannot be too entangled i know
[1:29:30] you're standing
[1:29:31] you can't be too entangled in what's
[1:29:33] going on in life
[1:29:35] in anybody's life
[1:29:37] including your own life because you've
[1:29:39] got a higher walk to walk
[1:29:42] and a higher place to live
[1:29:45] you are called to an ascended life
[1:29:49] a life that
[1:29:50] transcends life on planet earth
[1:29:54] you're a dual being one who has contact
[1:29:57] with the earth and one who has contact
[1:30:00] with the heavenlies all at the same time
[1:30:03] so may god give us the strength to
[1:30:05] endure hardness
[1:30:07] and may he give us wisdom not to be
[1:30:09] tangled up
[1:30:10] in the problems of our own life
[1:30:13] so that we forfeit the call of god on
[1:30:16] our life and we are not faithful to do
[1:30:18] what he has charged us to do
[1:30:21] because the most miserable man in the
[1:30:23] entire world brother david mann is
[1:30:26] somebody running from the presence of
[1:30:28] the lord
[1:30:29] trying to get out of what god has placed
[1:30:32] upon him or called him or her
[1:30:36] because i'm not one of those who
[1:30:38] believes that women don't have a call on
[1:30:40] their life
[1:30:41] they do have a call on their life and
[1:30:44] they're just as responsible for that
[1:30:46] call as any mail
[1:30:48] in this house if you believe that same
[1:30:50] man
[1:30:51] pray with me father we thank you this
[1:30:53] morning that you are god's sovereign and
[1:30:55] you are god's supreme
[1:30:57] you see all and know all
[1:31:00] you have power to change all
[1:31:03] now lord i'm asking you this morning you
[1:31:06] have done this you have put this on my
[1:31:08] heart
[1:31:09] you have taken me down this trail
[1:31:12] all week long to get to where we're
[1:31:14] going to be this morning
[1:31:16] and it's not what i wanted to talk about
[1:31:19] but it's what you have arrested me to
[1:31:22] talk about so i'm asking for your help
[1:31:25] i'm asking you to anoint us to surrender
[1:31:29] to yield i'm asking you to anoint every
[1:31:32] hearer
[1:31:34] that this word may not be something shed
[1:31:37] to fall
[1:31:38] on somebody else but that it be
[1:31:40] something that's claimed
[1:31:42] to take charge and hold of it for
[1:31:44] themselves to see themselves in this
[1:31:48] great battle
[1:31:49] and lord i ask you for strength at the
[1:31:51] end of this to remind us that the
[1:31:54] victory is ours and it doesn't matter
[1:31:56] how hard it gets
[1:31:58] or how much we lose on the way
[1:32:01] that you have promised to restore
[1:32:04] you have promised to see us through
[1:32:07] every weary mile
[1:32:09] help us i pray today in the lovely name
[1:32:13] of the lord jesus christ we pray amen
[1:32:16] and the saint said
[1:32:18] you may be seated i'm going to ask you
[1:32:23] to go out only when absolutely necessary
[1:32:27] this morning
[1:32:29] i want you to be still
[1:32:32] i want you to reverence god and his word
[1:32:36] if you are in the vestibule i want you
[1:32:38] to be quiet i don't want you out there
[1:32:40] chatting
[1:32:42] and talking this is not a time this is
[1:32:44] not social hour you know i don't say
[1:32:47] this often
[1:32:48] this is not a social hour you've got all
[1:32:51] afternoon to talk with one another if
[1:32:53] you're in the bathroom do your business
[1:32:56] and get out of there
[1:32:58] it's not a place to meet one another
[1:33:01] you'd think i would only be talking to
[1:33:03] children right
[1:33:06] but i'm not
[1:33:08] this is the most important time not
[1:33:10] because i'm involved
[1:33:12] but because he's involved
[1:33:15] somebody needs to know if you don't
[1:33:17] already know the battle is raging
[1:33:22] i want to say it real clear now so
[1:33:24] everyone can get a hold of it the battle
[1:33:26] is raging
[1:33:28] the battle for your health
[1:33:32] it's raging
[1:33:33] the battle for your freedom
[1:33:37] may god bless the fifth circuit court
[1:33:40] amen
[1:33:41] [Music]
[1:33:42] there's a lot of wickedness in that
[1:33:44] court
[1:33:45] may god help them for giving us a
[1:33:48] temporary stay
[1:33:50] on the overreaching mandate of our
[1:33:52] government
[1:33:54] may god continue to preserve freedom
[1:33:57] we don't know how long that will be to
[1:33:59] us or for us but we want to be we want
[1:34:01] to enjoy it and appreciate appreciated
[1:34:03] and celebrated as long as we possibly
[1:34:06] can
[1:34:07] if you don't have enough courage to
[1:34:09] protect yourself whatever you do protect
[1:34:12] your children
[1:34:14] it's our highest calling as a parent
[1:34:17] anybody want to say amen
[1:34:19] you don't mean that do you i mean it
[1:34:21] i mean it there's a battle raging for
[1:34:24] our health there's a battle raging for
[1:34:26] our freedoms there's a battle raging for
[1:34:29] our sanity
[1:34:32] the devil wants to run you t totally
[1:34:35] insane
[1:34:37] somebody said i can't aim in that you
[1:34:39] ought to
[1:34:40] because it's the truth
[1:34:42] and by amending it you're not going to
[1:34:43] claim it you're going to say i got my y
[1:34:46] eyes wide open preacher i know the enemy
[1:34:50] is after me
[1:34:52] one of these days the bride's going to
[1:34:54] recognize who she is
[1:34:56] she's going to get tired of running from
[1:34:58] the enemy
[1:34:59] and she's going to run toward the roar
[1:35:03] instead of him running us all over town
[1:35:05] we're going to run him
[1:35:08] this is what god has called us to do
[1:35:11] the bride of jesus christ should be
[1:35:14] shifting the atmosphere of planet earth
[1:35:18] we have authority to do that
[1:35:22] i'm not talking about taking seven
[1:35:24] mountains i'm not talking about all the
[1:35:27] distraction of the charismatic movement
[1:35:29] in this hour i'm not talking about
[1:35:32] stolen elections and false prophecies
[1:35:35] i'm not talking about any of that today
[1:35:39] i'm telling you that i can't get myself
[1:35:41] tangled up and entangled in what every
[1:35:45] prophetic person is saying
[1:35:47] i can't allow myself to drink at
[1:35:50] everybody's trough or to eat at
[1:35:52] everybody's table when god has done such
[1:35:56] a glorious job in this hour of storing
[1:35:59] up truth for the bride
[1:36:03] so that we might be prepared to face
[1:36:07] whatever it is that the enemy would
[1:36:11] throw against us
[1:36:13] we should be moving through the
[1:36:15] atmosphere in the realm of the spirit
[1:36:19] doing and undoing
[1:36:22] interceding
[1:36:24] when intercession is needed declaring
[1:36:27] when declaration is needing prophesying
[1:36:31] when prophecy is needed
[1:36:33] you take that word of god and speak it
[1:36:36] under the inspiration of the holy ghost
[1:36:38] you're not just talking the word you're
[1:36:41] not just quoting the bible you are
[1:36:44] prophesying
[1:36:45] into the atmosphere the word of the lord
[1:36:50] the word of the lord will shift a
[1:36:53] situation faster than fasting
[1:36:57] we need to be sensitive to the wooing of
[1:37:01] the spirit to fast
[1:37:03] we need to be more willing to push the
[1:37:07] plate away
[1:37:08] and hear from god
[1:37:11] but i want you to know using the word of
[1:37:13] god is a sold out holy ghost filled
[1:37:17] believer serving it right back into the
[1:37:21] nose of the dirty devil is more
[1:37:24] effective
[1:37:26] than any other spiritual discipline or
[1:37:28] exercise
[1:37:30] it'll move more devils than any hail
[1:37:32] mary ever moved
[1:37:34] come on now
[1:37:36] your personal sacrifice can move you in
[1:37:39] certain directions but remember these
[1:37:42] things are not to move god
[1:37:44] they're to move us
[1:37:46] there are people after all these years
[1:37:48] around the bride church who still
[1:37:51] believe that fasting is to move god
[1:37:58] hallelujah
[1:38:00] fasting is to move you
[1:38:04] it is to humble ourselves
[1:38:07] in such a way
[1:38:09] that we would be able
[1:38:11] to do exactly what god would have us to
[1:38:15] do here
[1:38:16] what he would want us to hear and when
[1:38:18] we don't know a decision we got a
[1:38:20] decision that's weighing on us we don't
[1:38:22] know what to do and we don't seem to be
[1:38:24] able to hear from god
[1:38:26] that's a great time
[1:38:28] to fast to pray
[1:38:30] to set yourself aside hide in him in him
[1:38:34] amen
[1:38:36] but fasting is not to move god fasting
[1:38:38] is to get you out of the way to get me
[1:38:41] out of the way
[1:38:42] if you want to see god move you pick up
[1:38:45] his word you start slinging it like a
[1:38:48] sword and believe it with everything
[1:38:50] you've got and god is duty-bound and
[1:38:54] obligated to move on behalf of that word
[1:38:58] you talk about rallying him off the
[1:39:01] throne you just let a little old
[1:39:03] believer it doesn't have to be a mighty
[1:39:05] giant just let it be the weakest
[1:39:08] christian
[1:39:09] get down on his or her knees and take
[1:39:13] god and his word
[1:39:17] and i want you to know angels stand at
[1:39:20] attention
[1:39:22] you want to move god off his throne do
[1:39:24] something like that
[1:39:26] the angels will start reporting and
[1:39:28] saying hey there's been a change in that
[1:39:31] little one there's been a change in your
[1:39:34] little daughter your son over there is
[1:39:37] taking authority that he's been
[1:39:38] forfeiting too long
[1:39:41] that'll get god moving
[1:39:43] your job is not to move god anyway
[1:39:47] your job is just to to discover what god
[1:39:50] would have you to do
[1:39:51] and get right in the middle of that and
[1:39:54] how do we get there we get there like
[1:39:55] brother greeley prayed this morning this
[1:39:57] is how we get there
[1:39:59] that we just say
[1:40:01] in earth
[1:40:04] in earth
[1:40:06] even as it is in heaven
[1:40:09] in earth
[1:40:10] even as it is in heaven
[1:40:12] and you can say in earth
[1:40:15] even as it is in heaven but i want you
[1:40:17] to know this is the earth that god's
[1:40:18] most concerned about
[1:40:20] you and i
[1:40:21] he made us from the earth
[1:40:23] he's most concerned about us are you
[1:40:25] here
[1:40:26] i believe you are for a few minutes so i
[1:40:28] got to hurry because i don't want to
[1:40:30] lose you in a message called the
[1:40:32] greatest battle ever fought what kind of
[1:40:34] a message about warfare would be
[1:40:36] complete without visiting that sermon
[1:40:43] it's really the bride's anthem
[1:40:48] i don't even know if there's a more
[1:40:49] important message for some of you to
[1:40:51] hear right now
[1:40:53] than the greatest battle ever fought
[1:40:55] because you're involved in that battle
[1:40:57] and you ought to know what it is
[1:41:00] you ought to know how to navigate
[1:41:03] the greatest battle ever fought and you
[1:41:05] ought to discover how to win it
[1:41:08] because i want to tell you that every
[1:41:10] devil in hell will tell you that it is
[1:41:13] not winnable
[1:41:15] but the word of god said you can win
[1:41:19] this battle
[1:41:21] you can overcome no matter how the
[1:41:24] battle is raging
[1:41:26] now do you know we've had wars after
[1:41:29] wars thank you ladies and rumors of wars
[1:41:33] and if the earth stands we'll have
[1:41:35] plenty more wars but do you realize that
[1:41:38] there's really only two powers in all
[1:41:41] the universe
[1:41:44] so i don't think communism
[1:41:47] is one of those two powers
[1:41:49] it's a part of one of those powers but
[1:41:51] if you want to know what the real battle
[1:41:53] and the real war is about he's about to
[1:41:55] tell us
[1:41:56] he said but do you realize
[1:41:59] that there is really only two powers
[1:42:03] in all the universe
[1:42:06] of all our differences between nations
[1:42:09] and differences between each other and
[1:42:13] everything
[1:42:14] it all mounts up
[1:42:16] to two powers
[1:42:18] put your finger right there a moment
[1:42:21] i don't have the
[1:42:23] the message quotes to give you but
[1:42:25] i was reading this week where brother
[1:42:28] branham was talking about
[1:42:30] the national spirit
[1:42:33] and what kind of a spirit germany has
[1:42:37] what kind of a spirit finland has
[1:42:40] what kind of a spirit the united states
[1:42:43] of america has don't you be satisfied by
[1:42:48] only carrying a national spirit
[1:42:51] it's possible to be patriotic and not
[1:42:54] carry a national spirit
[1:42:57] [Music]
[1:43:00] come on now
[1:43:01] you can be patriotic as an american
[1:43:04] without living under the influence of
[1:43:06] the spirit of
[1:43:08] america and she has one brother branham
[1:43:12] said even a church has a spirit
[1:43:14] and a pastor has a spirit
[1:43:17] he said sometimes you'll see a pastor
[1:43:19] jerk his head a certain way in the
[1:43:21] congregation we'll do the same
[1:43:24] that's not what it's going to take
[1:43:25] you're going to have to have more than
[1:43:27] an american spirit and more than a
[1:43:29] church spirit and more than a pastor
[1:43:32] spirit
[1:43:33] we're going to have to be sold out to
[1:43:35] the holy
[1:43:36] spirit and so this is not about persons
[1:43:40] or personalities
[1:43:42] it's not about the differences that we
[1:43:44] have with each other we're not all going
[1:43:46] to be just the same
[1:43:48] i'm not going to collect the things that
[1:43:50] you like some of you people like things
[1:43:53] that i don't like and i like things that
[1:43:55] you don't like
[1:43:58] not just food but a lot of preferences
[1:44:00] we have in life and some are not
[1:44:02] satisfied until everybody likes what
[1:44:05] they like
[1:44:06] now i want you to know that ain't going
[1:44:08] to do us any good in this hour
[1:44:10] everybody knows that kimchi is good
[1:44:16] you see all the deniers
[1:44:20] all of you living in denial
[1:44:23] anybody ought to know well can i say it
[1:44:25] this way it's good for you
[1:44:29] i had a few more supporters
[1:44:31] i like it
[1:44:34] every time i eat rotten cabbage
[1:44:40] i want you to know if you've never had
[1:44:42] any of miss stephanie's
[1:44:44] kimchi
[1:44:46] you need to schedule you a massage about
[1:44:48] the time she's making kimchi
[1:44:52] because i'm telling you she brings me a
[1:44:54] big old sack
[1:44:56] and when i take i haven't had it in
[1:44:58] quite a while but when i take that home
[1:45:00] the whole refrigerator if you don't tie
[1:45:02] it up real good
[1:45:04] the whole house will smell
[1:45:07] one time i was in the apartment in
[1:45:09] iceland
[1:45:10] brother eric was with me
[1:45:12] and
[1:45:13] sister christine had brought us kimchi
[1:45:16] and it was my job to heat up the meal
[1:45:18] that had been prepared for us
[1:45:20] and because you know eric didn't really
[1:45:22] know his way around the kitchen too much
[1:45:25] he he liked to say he did but i found
[1:45:27] out
[1:45:28] he was better in the microwave than he
[1:45:30] was anything else
[1:45:32] but i came out of there with the heated
[1:45:34] up food and he was happy to have all
[1:45:36] that i came out with some kimchi and he
[1:45:38] said that is the most awful foul
[1:45:41] smelling stuff that i've ever smelt in
[1:45:44] my life he said would you he was so
[1:45:47] serious he said would you please go into
[1:45:50] the bedroom to eat your lunch
[1:45:57] he didn't like it some of you don't like
[1:46:00] it i like it
[1:46:02] my idea is the more there's more for me
[1:46:07] if you don't like it there's more for me
[1:46:09] to have
[1:46:10] we are not all gonna like the same thing
[1:46:13] some of you are star wars fans i'm not
[1:46:19] some of you like i don't know we could
[1:46:21] just go up down the line
[1:46:23] uh there's a lot of things we don't have
[1:46:26] to get to the place
[1:46:28] where everything about us is just the
[1:46:31] same
[1:46:32] but what we need to recognize is it's
[1:46:35] the enemy
[1:46:37] who likes to
[1:46:38] magnify and amplify the differences
[1:46:42] among us
[1:46:44] instead of the similarities
[1:46:47] the holy ghost wants to anoint and
[1:46:50] magnify and amplify the things that we
[1:46:54] stand together on
[1:46:56] the enemy wants to blow everything else
[1:46:59] out of proportion
[1:47:01] [Applause]
[1:47:03] so that he gets more attention than the
[1:47:06] holy ghost i'm going to start calling
[1:47:08] names to make sure you're with me this
[1:47:10] morning
[1:47:11] i feel a little boldness here
[1:47:14] we need that sometime
[1:47:16] he said there's only two powers
[1:47:18] there's only two kingdoms
[1:47:20] two powers and two kingdoms
[1:47:24] all the rest
[1:47:26] the little minor things i'm going on now
[1:47:28] the minor things
[1:47:30] are connected with either one of those
[1:47:33] powers
[1:47:35] and those powers is god's power
[1:47:40] and satan's power
[1:47:43] now don't you forget that brother
[1:47:45] branham told us that the only power that
[1:47:48] satan has
[1:47:52] is the power we give him
[1:47:57] you don't believe that
[1:48:00] if you believe that you might not be as
[1:48:02] quick to blame him
[1:48:06] but you might search your heart and see
[1:48:09] where you are opening a door
[1:48:14] or keeping a door open
[1:48:17] to empower
[1:48:18] him
[1:48:20] to do what he's doing
[1:48:22] now this is for everybody you take your
[1:48:24] part
[1:48:25] this is for everybody
[1:48:27] if if the enemy is wreaking havoc
[1:48:31] you gotta find out why
[1:48:33] you have to find out sometime where is
[1:48:36] the open door where is the leaky cistern
[1:48:40] where is that weak place
[1:48:42] where am i allowing the enemy to stomp
[1:48:45] all over my emotions
[1:48:48] because otherwise he's just a tool in
[1:48:51] the hand of god to perfect the saints if
[1:48:55] you believe that same man he said that's
[1:48:57] what every war every disorder everything
[1:49:00] that comes along it's either controlled
[1:49:03] by god's power or satan's power because
[1:49:06] that's the only two powers there is and
[1:49:10] that is the power of life and the power
[1:49:14] of death now that's the only two powers
[1:49:18] if you believe that same man
[1:49:20] not three not four and a half two powers
[1:49:23] god's power satan's power
[1:49:26] everything else that moves among us is
[1:49:28] under the auspice of one of those powers
[1:49:32] it's either the working of god's power
[1:49:35] or the working of satan's power
[1:49:38] when we recognize this
[1:49:40] we should be able then to deal with him
[1:49:42] when he comes
[1:49:44] now one more here the third exodus
[1:49:47] i don't have any new scriptures
[1:49:49] now i only have a few quotes that i've
[1:49:51] never brought to you before
[1:49:53] most of them are going to be things that
[1:49:55] we have heard before
[1:49:57] but i'm asking you to give it your
[1:49:59] attention this morning perhaps in a way
[1:50:02] that you haven't in the past
[1:50:04] in paragraph 154 he said now remember
[1:50:08] there's only two don't forget this
[1:50:11] there's only two powers
[1:50:13] one is spiritual power of the holy
[1:50:16] spirit the other one is the devil
[1:50:21] [Music]
[1:50:23] he classifies
[1:50:25] the holy spirit as god's power
[1:50:29] and he puts underneath that
[1:50:32] the subtitle or subcategory
[1:50:36] spiritual power
[1:50:38] so god's power is holy spirit power
[1:50:42] and holy spirit power is spiritual power
[1:50:46] he said the other one is the devil
[1:50:50] working through
[1:50:52] don't miss the subtitle
[1:50:55] don't miss the sub category
[1:50:58] how does the devil work with his power
[1:51:01] he works it through
[1:51:03] intellectual
[1:51:06] power
[1:51:10] education is not of the enemy
[1:51:13] it can be hijacked and used for the
[1:51:16] enemy
[1:51:18] you can educate yourself right out of
[1:51:20] the spiritual life
[1:51:22] amen
[1:51:23] but it doesn't hurt you to have an
[1:51:25] education if you stay close to the lord
[1:51:29] if that becomes your number one goal in
[1:51:31] life you're going to miss what god has
[1:51:34] for you
[1:51:35] you're going to be an educated dummy
[1:51:39] when it comes to the things of the
[1:51:40] spirit
[1:51:42] there are too many educated dummies in
[1:51:44] the church world
[1:51:46] very very smart on many many many things
[1:51:50] but not practical enough to understand
[1:51:52] how the enemy is using them
[1:51:56] now god help us
[1:51:59] to understand what is motivating us
[1:52:03] this is not a time to sleep
[1:52:06] this is not a time to miss what god
[1:52:08] might say to you
[1:52:10] because there is a battle
[1:52:14] raging and it's broad
[1:52:18] but we win
[1:52:20] he said for that's where he entered in
[1:52:22] the garden of eden through intellectual
[1:52:25] conception or through intellectual
[1:52:27] powers
[1:52:28] to make eve believe in intellectual
[1:52:31] conception against the word
[1:52:34] just as plain as it can be the kids
[1:52:38] could get that see see and that's the
[1:52:41] way it's been all
[1:52:44] the way down
[1:52:46] had eve not have yielded
[1:52:49] to the intellectual interpretation of
[1:52:52] the serpent
[1:52:54] she would not have needed a covering
[1:52:58] because jesus god
[1:53:01] was already her covering
[1:53:05] but she needed adam because she yielded
[1:53:09] herself to intellectual conception
[1:53:13] and she was made to doubt
[1:53:17] ultimately that god is good
[1:53:21] and that he's for you and not against
[1:53:23] you
[1:53:24] it's one of the hardest messages to get
[1:53:26] people even around the message to
[1:53:28] embrace in this hour is that god is for
[1:53:32] you
[1:53:35] many of us still have a denominational
[1:53:38] or pentecostal or holiness conception
[1:53:42] of a god who gets up every morning ready
[1:53:45] to smoosh you
[1:53:50] like an ant
[1:53:52] he would not his kingdom that
[1:53:54] way
[1:53:55] he needs you
[1:53:57] somebody say i don't believe god needs
[1:53:59] anybody god said he did
[1:54:02] he needs a yielded vessel
[1:54:05] he needs somebody to work through
[1:54:09] satan needs somebody to work through
[1:54:13] it's not likely he's going to take a
[1:54:15] form and walk in here himself this
[1:54:17] morning
[1:54:19] but he will look for a form to work
[1:54:22] through
[1:54:25] he'll work through me
[1:54:27] he'll work through you
[1:54:29] and if we're not on the job
[1:54:32] if we're not very very alert
[1:54:35] in hours like this
[1:54:37] we'll find ourself fighting on the wrong
[1:54:40] side
[1:54:41] we'll find ourself advancing the wrong
[1:54:44] team
[1:54:45] hello brother sister
[1:54:47] you want to make sure that what you say
[1:54:50] in here what you do in here what you do
[1:54:53] in community with each other you do it
[1:54:57] to glorify god
[1:54:59] to advance the vision of this house
[1:55:04] because that's why god has you here
[1:55:07] come on now that's why you're here
[1:55:10] and we thank god for you
[1:55:12] in the first seal
[1:55:14] i'm reading this this morning i'm
[1:55:16] preaching this this morning well you're
[1:55:18] just quoting right now yeah i'm going to
[1:55:20] let all the blame go right on back to
[1:55:22] where this star this truth started
[1:55:25] brother random's got broad shoulders
[1:55:29] i know why some won't preach the message
[1:55:32] they don't want to be called an
[1:55:33] accountability
[1:55:35] for what the message says
[1:55:37] i am i'm willing i'm willing i'm not
[1:55:40] ashamed
[1:55:42] of original sin
[1:55:44] i'm not ashamed that god is one
[1:55:47] i'm not ashamed that talking in tongues
[1:55:49] is not the initial evidence of the holy
[1:55:51] ghost
[1:55:52] i'm not ashamed that that baptism
[1:55:55] christian baptism is in the name of the
[1:55:57] lord jesus christ
[1:55:59] i'm not ashamed to stand on those things
[1:56:02] because i know that this is truth it's
[1:56:05] not a truth
[1:56:08] anybody with me
[1:56:10] it's the truth
[1:56:12] the truth is going to stand when the
[1:56:14] world's on fire
[1:56:15] so we were singing megan was singing are
[1:56:18] you still with me
[1:56:19] sister megan was singing
[1:56:22] and uh me i don't remember if everybody
[1:56:24] was helping her on that one or not
[1:56:27] but she was single the battle is raging
[1:56:32] what's the next line
[1:56:35] huh
[1:56:38] the battle is raging
[1:56:40] the devil is raging
[1:56:46] i don't want to be sleeping
[1:56:51] when the battle is raging
[1:56:54] and they were also singing
[1:56:58] what's the other song david you all were
[1:56:59] singing
[1:57:01] praise him for the victory
[1:57:04] and we got a shofar blowing
[1:57:07] and i almost started slinging the sword
[1:57:13] but that's heavy that thing's heavy
[1:57:17] there was war
[1:57:19] it was praise war
[1:57:21] it was worship war
[1:57:24] it
[1:57:25] i love that line
[1:57:28] worship
[1:57:30] drives him
[1:57:32] out of his mind
[1:57:38] what does praise do
[1:57:40] praise gets him confused
[1:57:43] some of you if you were to start
[1:57:44] praising the lord you'd confuse us
[1:57:48] we wouldn't know what he got ahold of
[1:57:50] you
[1:57:52] when a believer praises with everything
[1:57:56] he's got
[1:58:00] it confuses the enemy
[1:58:03] the jews believe that the sound of the
[1:58:05] shofar is such a powerful voice
[1:58:09] that god speaks
[1:58:12] through the sound of the shofar in a
[1:58:15] language that satan
[1:58:18] cannot interpret
[1:58:21] and praise operates that way
[1:58:24] and worship drives him out of his mind
[1:58:30] and sometimes we get criticism
[1:58:36] so i had a few criticisms
[1:58:38] and they said i i just would like to
[1:58:42] mention
[1:58:44] that you all sure do a lot of warring
[1:58:47] and a lot of fighting
[1:58:53] somebody's on the devil's radar
[1:58:56] [Music]
[1:58:59] well don't you know brother branham said
[1:59:01] that true seed
[1:59:04] forgive me i'm gonna i just don't want
[1:59:06] to make fun of people
[1:59:08] but i want to laugh
[1:59:10] at the at the spirit of stupid
[1:59:14] that gets on some folks i know you don't
[1:59:16] like it
[1:59:18] they don't like it when i say jehovah's
[1:59:19] sneaky either
[1:59:22] but it is a it is it's it's a stupid
[1:59:25] statement
[1:59:27] people get carried away in in in their
[1:59:31] stupid ways sometime
[1:59:34] you're doing a lot of war and you're
[1:59:35] doing a lot of fighting
[1:59:37] we know that if you don't have a battle
[1:59:39] to fight
[1:59:41] there's no challenge there's no conflict
[1:59:45] something is just wrong
[1:59:48] if the devil's not after you something's
[1:59:50] wrong
[1:59:52] if he's not trying to afflict you
[1:59:54] something's wrong if he's not trying to
[1:59:56] stop you something's wrong i just wrote
[1:59:59] back and said we not only have to war
[2:00:02] for what the enemy wants to do in our
[2:00:04] own congregation but because so many of
[2:00:07] you don't even know there's a battle
[2:00:09] going on
[2:00:11] we have to war on your behalf
[2:00:14] we have to take up the challenge of the
[2:00:16] bride
[2:00:17] [Music]
[2:00:18] and sometimes press through
[2:00:21] believing god for breakthrough
[2:00:25] in your cemetery
[2:00:26] [Music]
[2:00:28] i'm not going to apologize
[2:00:31] [Music]
[2:00:33] for the fact that we don't sing three
[2:00:36] dead dry crusty songs
[2:00:40] and call it breakthrough worship
[2:00:43] remember every church is sovereign
[2:00:47] and the pastor is the highest spiritual
[2:00:50] authority in that church i'm just
[2:00:52] quoting
[2:00:54] i'm just quoting
[2:00:56] and so if you don't do it that way where
[2:00:58] you are i understand
[2:01:02] but there is a battle
[2:01:04] raging
[2:01:07] who wants to be found sleeping
[2:01:11] when the devil is raging
[2:01:13] i love
[2:01:15] the lines of that song
[2:01:17] we don't fight as one who shadow boxes
[2:01:21] [Music]
[2:01:23] that's what it means
[2:01:25] we don't fight as one who beats the air
[2:01:28] we know where the target is
[2:01:31] we know who the enemy is
[2:01:34] and we know the only way to defeat him
[2:01:36] is by the word of god
[2:01:38] and the only way to create an atmosphere
[2:01:40] to use the word as it's properly used is
[2:01:44] through praise and worship
[2:01:45] to get the atmosphere all cleaned out
[2:01:52] there's no need for you to go walk
[2:01:54] around the boundaries of this property
[2:01:58] and seal it with the blood of jesus
[2:02:01] as long as there's demon spirits on this
[2:02:04] property
[2:02:08] well you're just sealing them in
[2:02:12] all right it's going to get tough here
[2:02:13] in a minute
[2:02:16] there has to be a cleansing first
[2:02:19] now i'm using i'm using this place as an
[2:02:22] example but that's not that wasn't what
[2:02:24] i was dealing with this week
[2:02:26] we were dealing with some friends of
[2:02:28] ours who are experiencing unusual forms
[2:02:32] of witchcraft
[2:02:34] one that's very familiar to me
[2:02:36] i don't understand them all i haven't
[2:02:38] dealt with them all but some are
[2:02:40] familiar to me
[2:02:42] and this particular form of witchcraft
[2:02:44] is familiar to me
[2:02:46] and so in a desperation to try to find
[2:02:48] out what we can do
[2:02:51] to seal this thing off and to send these
[2:02:54] harassing demon spirits
[2:02:56] they were identified to me as harassing
[2:02:59] spirits that did not have the power to
[2:03:01] kill
[2:03:02] neither did they have the power to
[2:03:04] inflict pain
[2:03:09] all they have the power to do is harass
[2:03:14] and to
[2:03:15] hijack
[2:03:17] a root
[2:03:20] that's already present
[2:03:22] in someone's heart
[2:03:26] and so that's how the enemy harasses
[2:03:30] now there's other there's ranks and
[2:03:33] we know there's divisions
[2:03:35] in the in the in darkness just like
[2:03:37] there is in the kingdom of light
[2:03:40] we know that there are ranks and
[2:03:42] different divisions of angelic hosts the
[2:03:45] bible seems to teach us this
[2:03:48] and if that's so then there are also
[2:03:51] ranks of authority etc in the in the
[2:03:54] darkness and and most of the time we
[2:03:57] think we're really fighting i want to be
[2:03:59] honest with you most of the time we
[2:04:00] think we're fighting you know the prince
[2:04:02] of
[2:04:03] alabama
[2:04:06] and all we're really dealing with is
[2:04:08] those little spirits that have no power
[2:04:12] to do anything unless you're already in
[2:04:14] the middle of it
[2:04:18] don't act like you don't know what i'm
[2:04:19] talking about
[2:04:22] what they do is they find somebody who
[2:04:25] has a problem with authority
[2:04:28] carried it all of their life
[2:04:30] that demon can't put that on you
[2:04:33] he doesn't have the power to plant that
[2:04:36] spirit in you or that root in you
[2:04:39] all he does is he has the power to come
[2:04:42] fertilize it and blow on it and utilize
[2:04:44] it
[2:04:46] so that he so the enemy gets all the
[2:04:48] attention
[2:04:50] he didn't give you that
[2:04:53] you you're like me you've carried things
[2:04:56] in your life
[2:04:57] those little spirits come and don't you
[2:05:00] think they don't know
[2:05:01] what's being said this morning
[2:05:04] those little spirits will come and
[2:05:05] really all they can do is harass
[2:05:08] mock
[2:05:10] stir
[2:05:12] so you let somebody that's already prone
[2:05:14] to temper
[2:05:18] already prone to a little bit of
[2:05:19] jealousy already prone to a little bit
[2:05:20] of bitterness already be pro i don't
[2:05:23] know what to name you
[2:05:25] a little bit of religion
[2:05:28] that's already in them
[2:05:30] can't blame it all on
[2:05:32] satan some of it is just the way of life
[2:05:36] we've picked up things because we nursed
[2:05:39] what we should have murdered
[2:05:44] we kept alive what we should have killed
[2:05:47] come on we kept in our house what we
[2:05:49] should have driven into the wilderness
[2:05:52] [Music]
[2:05:53] so the enemy comes and he blows on and
[2:05:55] he anoints it and he uses it you know
[2:05:57] i'm you know what i'm talking about this
[2:06:00] is no this is not new to some of you
[2:06:02] people
[2:06:03] you know that uh you that have had
[2:06:06] problems of rejection or daddy issues or
[2:06:08] whatever el mama issues or whatever else
[2:06:11] you have you know the devil didn't put
[2:06:13] that in you
[2:06:15] just the shape of your life what you've
[2:06:17] experienced
[2:06:19] all part of god's plan
[2:06:22] that's where it usually gets quiet
[2:06:24] all part of god's plan
[2:06:27] don't you don't you try to tell me
[2:06:29] there's an enemy out there that's
[2:06:31] stronger than the god who created him
[2:06:33] don't you tell me his plan is is more
[2:06:36] executable than the plan of god for your
[2:06:38] life no no no no no
[2:06:41] all the things that god uses to mold us
[2:06:44] and shape us
[2:06:45] but we leave a little something unhealed
[2:06:47] on whole
[2:06:49] undealt with
[2:06:51] sometimes we adopt it as our identity
[2:06:53] and without that we're nobody
[2:06:56] remember if some people didn't have
[2:06:58] arthritis they wouldn't be nobody
[2:07:04] there's no need to call them john or
[2:07:07] or sally
[2:07:09] you could just call them who they are
[2:07:11] arthritis
[2:07:13] my arthritis
[2:07:15] my condition
[2:07:17] what i've been through
[2:07:20] we own those things until we become
[2:07:22] those things
[2:07:24] and then the enemy you you let
[2:07:25] witchcraft be at least are you listening
[2:07:29] you let witchcraft get stirred up like
[2:07:31] it is right now
[2:07:33] and what that what them little imps will
[2:07:35] do those little little harassers
[2:07:38] what they do is they will come and take
[2:07:39] advantage of those things that you're
[2:07:41] carrying and they'll make them look
[2:07:43] bigger than they've ever looked before
[2:07:45] and they'll make you feel so hopeless
[2:07:47] and they'll make you feel smothered and
[2:07:49] they'll make you feel panicked and
[2:07:51] they'll make you feel like you can't
[2:07:52] breathe
[2:07:53] come on that's exactly what they do and
[2:07:55] if you and i can recognize this ain't a
[2:07:58] new devil
[2:07:59] this ain't the prince of the power over
[2:08:01] alabama this ain't the highest devil in
[2:08:04] the united states this is just harassing
[2:08:07] spirit tormenting devils from hell that
[2:08:10] have come to take advantage of what i've
[2:08:12] been through in life that i didn't deal
[2:08:14] with
[2:08:16] and they magnify and amplified anointed
[2:08:19] and stir it up and cause it to get lots
[2:08:22] of attention so that the enemy is lifted
[2:08:25] up and jesus sits in the corner with
[2:08:27] dirty feet
[2:08:28] this is how the enemy works and he can't
[2:08:31] always work this way just in church
[2:08:33] entity but he sure can get in a
[2:08:35] community of bride and do everything he
[2:08:38] can to keep us focused on all the wrong
[2:08:40] things when we need to be focusing on
[2:08:42] the right things you don't have to say
[2:08:44] amen i've made it without your amen so
[2:08:47] far
[2:08:50] but it is the truth
[2:08:52] so i had to answer this and i didn't
[2:08:54] want to do it in the wrong spirit
[2:08:56] and i had to let him know that this
[2:08:58] message is truth it is the truth
[2:09:03] and if there is a spiritual war to be
[2:09:05] had in the world
[2:09:07] it's going to be had around this
[2:09:10] message
[2:09:12] the truth
[2:09:14] can anybody see why the enemy would hate
[2:09:16] it if it is the truth
[2:09:18] don't you see why the enemy would try to
[2:09:20] sabotage it
[2:09:22] and try to make you read some website
[2:09:24] somewhere that brother branham was a
[2:09:25] false prophet the truth is you don't
[2:09:27] understand it so shut up
[2:09:32] that mean
[2:09:33] it didn't mean to be mean
[2:09:35] the fact is you don't understand it so
[2:09:37] shut up
[2:09:39] well i don't know if there was really
[2:09:41] that many people fell off the bridge
[2:09:42] shut up
[2:09:47] i wasn't there either
[2:09:48] what are we going to do about the brown
[2:09:50] bear shut up
[2:09:53] that's what i'm going to do
[2:09:55] i'm not asking you to do anything i'm
[2:09:56] not going to do
[2:09:57] if i don't understand it i'm going to
[2:10:00] leave it with the one who said it
[2:10:03] but i'm not going to let a scarecrow
[2:10:06] that the devil hangs on the www
[2:10:10] i'm not going to let the devil keep me
[2:10:12] from the best strawberries in the patch
[2:10:15] because he hangs a scarecrow out there
[2:10:17] and tries to have some of your loved
[2:10:19] ones tell you you're in a cult
[2:10:25] you gotta make up your mind i didn't i
[2:10:27] didn't get in this thing to run from
[2:10:29] scarecrows
[2:10:32] i'm going to knock them right out of my
[2:10:34] way and find those strawberries
[2:10:38] because if there's going to be any fat
[2:10:40] birds sitting up on the line i'm going
[2:10:42] to be one of them fat birds
[2:10:46] gerald miller
[2:10:48] who was an editor of the magazine that
[2:10:50] followed the brownsville revival
[2:10:53] it was a magazine written and
[2:10:55] distributed across the whole world
[2:10:58] he interviewed
[2:11:00] paul keith and i one time
[2:11:02] about our association with brother
[2:11:03] branham
[2:11:04] what we believed about brother branham
[2:11:06] and he came here to one of our meetings
[2:11:08] one time and he wrote an article and in
[2:11:10] that article he wrote about those uh
[2:11:12] he wrote you want to check that
[2:11:15] he he wrote in his article
[2:11:17] uh about this story and about the
[2:11:19] strawberries
[2:11:21] and he said when i hear them preacher
[2:11:23] talk i just see them two fat birds upon
[2:11:26] the line let's eat all the strawberries
[2:11:29] because they weren't afraid of the
[2:11:30] scarecrows
[2:11:31] you see all the other little birds out
[2:11:33] there skinning
[2:11:36] because they let all the all the the
[2:11:39] websites
[2:11:42] and all the dissenters
[2:11:44] and all the skeptics
[2:11:48] the ones who throw around well that
[2:11:50] didn't come to pass that didn't come to
[2:11:51] pass that didn't come to pass i have
[2:11:53] them
[2:11:55] you have them
[2:11:57] whether you know it or not
[2:11:59] they get together not too far from this
[2:12:00] place they get together and they
[2:12:02] rehearse some of those things i wish
[2:12:04] they were as faithful to rehearse the
[2:12:05] things that god has already kept
[2:12:09] as they are to try to celebrate the
[2:12:10] things that haven't come to pass
[2:12:12] but the whole truth is this if you don't
[2:12:14] understand it you ought to shut up
[2:12:17] [Applause]
[2:12:18] because it's just like the scripture
[2:12:20] tells us you don't want to find yourself
[2:12:22] fighting
[2:12:23] against something that god has ordained
[2:12:27] it's up to him to bring his word to pass
[2:12:30] i'm not here i know it's i'm going to
[2:12:32] get off of this
[2:12:33] because it sounds like we're being
[2:12:34] defensive and that's not that is not i
[2:12:36] want to defend the message of truth i
[2:12:38] want to defend the truth that's what i
[2:12:40] want to offend i'm not here to defend
[2:12:42] this church
[2:12:43] it's got a lot of problems
[2:12:48] you want to see some of them look around
[2:12:52] because where people gather
[2:12:56] problems come
[2:12:59] you ever find the perfect church
[2:13:01] stay here
[2:13:04] you ever go out there and find a perfect
[2:13:06] church stay here we wouldn't want to
[2:13:07] muddle up what they've got
[2:13:10] right
[2:13:11] you wouldn't want to take your own
[2:13:13] imperfect self over there and mess up
[2:13:14] what they've been working for
[2:13:17] there's no such thing when you've got
[2:13:18] people together you're going to get all
[2:13:21] the bumps and warts
[2:13:24] skin tags
[2:13:27] all the things that come yes you are
[2:13:31] but we're not looking
[2:13:33] at the problem
[2:13:34] we're not looking at the differences
[2:13:37] we're looking to find what unifies us
[2:13:41] and what makes us one and what makes us
[2:13:44] one is we've been called to a word
[2:13:47] we've been called to a person
[2:13:50] and his name is not brother branham his
[2:13:53] name is the lord jesus christ
[2:13:56] and his word is going to stand when the
[2:13:59] whole world is on fire
[2:14:01] we're going to honor the messenger
[2:14:04] we're going to honor the man of god who
[2:14:06] gave the who gave the message who
[2:14:09] yielded his life and sacrificed so much
[2:14:13] i hate to tell you he wasn't perfect
[2:14:18] he wasn't perfect he said he wasn't
[2:14:19] perfect he said he made thousands of
[2:14:21] mistakes
[2:14:23] somebody sent me this week a question
[2:14:26] with a picture of brother branham
[2:14:27] standing there with his family and his
[2:14:28] daughters in little miniskirts
[2:14:30] practically
[2:14:32] and they said we get asked this question
[2:14:34] all the time
[2:14:35] how is it that a mighty prophet of god
[2:14:37] like that would let his
[2:14:40] daughter stand there with those short
[2:14:41] skirts on i'm just glad sister mita had
[2:14:44] a little longer one on that sunday
[2:14:47] because she had a tendency to
[2:14:49] it's kind of a fashion in that day fad
[2:14:53] you could see a little more of their
[2:14:54] legs than you needed to
[2:14:56] and some people use that as though
[2:14:58] they're going to discredit
[2:15:00] the ministry that god gave brother
[2:15:02] branham because there were things that
[2:15:03] he didn't catch
[2:15:07] don't be quiet in here now
[2:15:10] there's no dual there's no dual purpose
[2:15:12] in this what i'm saying this is just
[2:15:14] for the purpose intended
[2:15:16] to let you know that he was not a
[2:15:17] perfect man
[2:15:19] if he hadn't been a perfect man he would
[2:15:20] have sent that daughter right back in if
[2:15:22] he'd have seen it if he'd have seen it
[2:15:24] he'd have sent that daughter right back
[2:15:26] in and said it's time you're getting old
[2:15:27] enough now to cover your knee
[2:15:30] you're getting old enough now
[2:15:33] maybe that day they won't wear them to
[2:15:34] the ankles like i prefer
[2:15:38] but
[2:15:39] that is nothing
[2:15:42] i don't take it somebody said well you
[2:15:43] know the prophet had a christmas tree
[2:15:45] and the prophet did this and the prophet
[2:15:47] did that i want you to know something
[2:15:49] i'm not called to answer for him
[2:15:51] i'm only called to answer for me
[2:15:54] and as a pastor i'm called here to
[2:15:56] answer for you when i can
[2:15:58] sometimes there's no answer
[2:16:00] but when i can i will i'm more than
[2:16:02] willing to do that but i want you to
[2:16:04] know there's always an enemy out there
[2:16:06] that wants to discredit everything that
[2:16:08] you hold dear
[2:16:10] don't you let it i got to move on
[2:16:13] i want to read this in the first seal i
[2:16:14] want you to know why there's such a war
[2:16:16] raging it's 113 i need a little more
[2:16:18] time paragraph 63 notice what happens as
[2:16:22] we go along here is the plan of it
[2:16:25] the first thing happens there's an
[2:16:26] announcement in the heavens first what
[2:16:29] happens a seal is opened
[2:16:32] that's powerful
[2:16:34] what is that a mystery is unfolded see
[2:16:37] and when a mystery unfolds then a
[2:16:40] trumpet sounds
[2:16:42] can somebody tell me what the trumpet
[2:16:44] sound does
[2:16:47] it declares a war
[2:16:50] the war
[2:16:52] is raging
[2:16:54] the message has caused a war to rage the
[2:17:00] revelation of jesus christ has disturbed
[2:17:03] the atmosphere
[2:17:05] and there is a war
[2:17:08] raging because of great precious truth
[2:17:13] that has broken into the earth
[2:17:16] he said a plague falls and the church
[2:17:19] age opened see are you with me
[2:17:22] he said what is the war part the angel
[2:17:25] of the church
[2:17:26] catches the mystery of god
[2:17:32] can't linger on this line too long
[2:17:35] or they'll accuse us of something else
[2:17:38] the angel of the church catches the
[2:17:40] mystery of god not
[2:17:43] fully
[2:17:44] yet
[2:17:45] revealed
[2:17:48] anybody see that
[2:17:49] but when he does he catches the mystery
[2:17:53] of god and then he goes forth to the
[2:17:56] people
[2:17:57] after the mystery has been given to him
[2:18:00] that's exactly what our prophet did
[2:18:03] all right he goes on
[2:18:06] you you're here good praise the lord
[2:18:13] he begins to proclaim
[2:18:17] that
[2:18:18] message
[2:18:20] it goes forth to the people what does he
[2:18:22] do out there he begins
[2:18:24] to proclaim that message and when does
[2:18:28] it start
[2:18:31] a war
[2:18:34] a spiritual war
[2:18:36] are you really gonna text me and email
[2:18:39] me and ask me why so many of our songs
[2:18:42] last sunday were about war
[2:18:45] you're really gonna ask me that
[2:18:47] and you've got the answer right in front
[2:18:50] of you
[2:18:51] when truth is declared and when truth is
[2:18:54] decreed and when truth breaks out in the
[2:18:57] earth and breaks forth in the earth it
[2:18:59] causes a disturbance in the atmosphere
[2:19:02] that has been going now decade after
[2:19:05] decade after decade and what you sense
[2:19:08] now is not a new battle what you sense
[2:19:11] now is not a new war it's the same old
[2:19:15] war that's being amplified on the
[2:19:18] battlefield
[2:19:20] [Music]
[2:19:22] of the mind
[2:19:24] if you understand that say amen
[2:19:27] in the message testimony
[2:19:29] raising the dead boy this is page two i
[2:19:32] have ten ten or 11 pages i won't get to
[2:19:34] them
[2:19:35] because i want to make sure that you
[2:19:37] don't get so weary
[2:19:39] that you miss what's already been said
[2:19:42] testimony the racing of the dead boy in
[2:19:44] 1953 in florida
[2:19:47] paragraph 14.
[2:19:52] you've got to get
[2:19:54] you've got to go do it
[2:19:57] you've got to fight for every inch of
[2:20:00] ground that you have
[2:20:05] why are y'all singing so many songs
[2:20:06] about war
[2:20:10] because not even a single solitary inch
[2:20:14] is going to fall into your lap
[2:20:17] without a battle
[2:20:20] every blessing you get there's going to
[2:20:22] be a war
[2:20:24] there's going to be a battle there's
[2:20:26] going to be an opposition
[2:20:28] to keep that out of your life
[2:20:30] you're going to have to fight for every
[2:20:32] inch of ground that you have
[2:20:36] you're going to have to make sure that
[2:20:38] you're able to deal with all of your
[2:20:40] stuff
[2:20:41] and stay out from under everybody else's
[2:20:44] stuff
[2:20:46] so that you can keep pressing toward the
[2:20:48] mark
[2:20:49] because if you don't you will be waylaid
[2:20:51] you will be off to the side
[2:20:54] and you will not find the strength that
[2:20:56] you need to overcome
[2:20:58] in this last hour
[2:21:00] he said you've got to fight for every
[2:21:01] inch of ground that you have every man
[2:21:04] in here that's born again of the spirit
[2:21:05] of god knows that you've had to fight
[2:21:08] for every inch of ground
[2:21:10] tow the mark with satan
[2:21:16] lined up
[2:21:18] you look over there to see who's running
[2:21:19] against you
[2:21:21] you are toe
[2:21:22] toed up
[2:21:24] with satan
[2:21:27] he is towing the mark
[2:21:29] right next door to you
[2:21:32] isn't that right friends
[2:21:35] this
[2:21:36] is
[2:21:37] not
[2:21:38] a
[2:21:39] picnic
[2:21:41] [Music]
[2:21:44] pretty sure i had that underlined and
[2:21:46] bolded there but you can see it
[2:21:49] this is not a picnic
[2:21:52] this is a battleground
[2:21:56] see we never come here
[2:22:02] somebody said well it's a tabernacle no
[2:22:04] he's preaching in west palm beach
[2:22:05] florida
[2:22:08] he's preaching in a perhaps auditorium i
[2:22:10] don't know church or an auditorium but
[2:22:13] it's a holy ghost meeting
[2:22:15] and people are gathered there in the
[2:22:16] name of the lord and he said we never
[2:22:18] come here to eat cookies and so forth
[2:22:23] we're in a battle
[2:22:30] there's not always time to give you your
[2:22:32] bottle
[2:22:37] somebody ought to say man
[2:22:39] there's not always time to pet you
[2:22:47] it's just a fact
[2:22:51] we didn't come here this morning to eat
[2:22:53] cookies
[2:22:56] we came here to fight a battle
[2:22:59] not about flesh and blood not about
[2:23:01] people not about personalities not about
[2:23:04] differences that we have with one
[2:23:05] another not about the fact that you're
[2:23:07] not smart enough to know how delicious
[2:23:09] kimchi is
[2:23:12] there's no battle over that
[2:23:15] we're not here to fight over things that
[2:23:17] don't matter
[2:23:18] [Music]
[2:23:20] i'm gonna fight listen let me tell you
[2:23:22] something i'm gonna fight for souls i'm
[2:23:24] gonna fight for families i'm gonna fight
[2:23:26] for lives i'm gonna fight for my
[2:23:29] children and if you'll get out of my way
[2:23:31] i'll fight for your children
[2:23:34] this is a battle
[2:23:38] it rages
[2:23:41] [Applause]
[2:23:43] we're going to have to make a stand
[2:23:46] now last weekend god did some things for
[2:23:49] us
[2:23:50] just like he did at camp meeting
[2:23:53] just like he has time and time and time
[2:23:57] and time and time again i'm supporting
[2:24:00] it i tell you god sent brother dwayne
[2:24:03] jackson here to preach for us and i have
[2:24:07] come long enough on this journey
[2:24:09] that i don't let it hurt my feelings
[2:24:13] when you amen on your feet clapping your
[2:24:16] hands
[2:24:18] over things i have said for years and
[2:24:20] years in you
[2:24:23] you say why'd you mention it because i
[2:24:24] want you to know
[2:24:26] that i ain't a dummy
[2:24:30] and i know where the transcripts are
[2:24:33] and it does not it does not
[2:24:36] because it's a five-fold ministry
[2:24:39] [Music]
[2:24:39] [Applause]
[2:24:41] now the truth is i was asked
[2:24:45] to preach
[2:24:47] the banquet
[2:24:49] and i said absolutely
[2:24:53] not
[2:24:55] i want somebody fresh
[2:24:59] i want somebody that'll come in here and
[2:25:01] help the young people brother dwayne had
[2:25:03] never preached a youth meeting he had
[2:25:05] never preached a a youth banquet he'd
[2:25:07] been involved in youth banquets but
[2:25:09] never preached one but something dropped
[2:25:11] it in our hearts
[2:25:13] that he was the one for the job
[2:25:17] and was he
[2:25:19] oh
[2:25:21] he was
[2:25:23] when i left here tuesday when i left the
[2:25:25] pulpit tuesday night and i went back
[2:25:27] there i looked glanced down at my phone
[2:25:29] and brother jackson and sister brother
[2:25:32] dwayne and sister heather had been
[2:25:33] streaming the service tuesday night and
[2:25:36] weeping
[2:25:38] brother greeley said he was blubbering
[2:25:40] they had been weeping and rejoicing and
[2:25:43] praising the lord because so many times
[2:25:46] an evangelist will come and preach
[2:25:49] and never know the fruit
[2:25:51] that's why we try to i've always tried
[2:25:54] to text
[2:25:56] and tell them some of the things that we
[2:25:59] hear that god has done but nothing could
[2:26:02] have the effect
[2:26:04] and not only that he told me he'd listen
[2:26:07] to it again
[2:26:09] and not only that some of you have told
[2:26:11] me you went back and watched it again
[2:26:12] i've got about halfway through i've got
[2:26:14] the other half to get through but i've
[2:26:16] listened again to about another half of
[2:26:18] it and i cried at the same places i
[2:26:20] cried tuesday night and i rejoiced at
[2:26:23] the same places that i rejoiced tuesday
[2:26:25] night because i know it was sovereign
[2:26:27] and i know man didn't do it and i know
[2:26:29] you didn't do it and i know brother
[2:26:31] jackson didn't do it i know i didn't do
[2:26:33] it
[2:26:34] but i know god did
[2:26:39] but i want to bring a balance for you
[2:26:41] this morning and i want you to know he
[2:26:42] has before
[2:26:45] he has before
[2:26:47] and our leaky cisterns
[2:26:50] this is not to condemn
[2:26:52] no this is not even to whip this is not
[2:26:55] even to correct as a pastor this is to
[2:26:58] try to inspire i have to tell the
[2:27:00] reality of the truth
[2:27:02] so that you can be inspired to
[2:27:04] understand how powerful it is what
[2:27:06] you're holding in your hands this
[2:27:08] morning is more valuable and more
[2:27:10] powerful than what you realize
[2:27:13] because you are holding keys
[2:27:17] for next weekend
[2:27:19] and the next weekend
[2:27:21] and the next weekend
[2:27:24] we cannot wait until we have a special
[2:27:26] series of meetings
[2:27:28] to get excited about the truth
[2:27:32] but we must recognize that a snowball is
[2:27:36] rolling
[2:27:38] a holy one
[2:27:42] i'm going to say a fireball
[2:27:45] i can't hardly compare the spiritual to
[2:27:47] snow
[2:27:49] there's a fireball that's been rolling
[2:27:52] and like a snowball it just gains and
[2:27:56] gains and gains and gains and gains
[2:28:02] as long as it keeps moving
[2:28:05] [Music]
[2:28:09] but as soon as it stalls
[2:28:13] as soon
[2:28:15] as something doesn't go your way
[2:28:18] and you come in here mad at your wife
[2:28:22] upset with your husband
[2:28:26] disturb because of what you saw on
[2:28:28] facebook
[2:28:30] and get off of it
[2:28:33] if it moves you that emotionally get off
[2:28:35] of it
[2:28:37] don't let that steal your joy
[2:28:40] don't let that be the reason that you
[2:28:42] sit down
[2:28:44] when god wants you to stand up
[2:28:46] come on now i'm telling you what we have
[2:28:50] a pregnant moment
[2:28:53] our young people have a pregnant moment
[2:28:56] right now
[2:29:03] i don't want
[2:29:05] somebody's temper to flare
[2:29:08] on a volleyball court
[2:29:11] i don't want somebody smack talk
[2:29:15] i don't want somebody feeling like you
[2:29:18] didn't support my
[2:29:20] event
[2:29:24] i don't want anything
[2:29:27] to rise up among us
[2:29:31] that would impede slow down
[2:29:35] stall
[2:29:37] that rolling pillar of fire that is
[2:29:41] moving through this place
[2:29:44] last sunday morning burning out shaft
[2:29:48] and causing people to get above the
[2:29:50] things that have disturbed them for so
[2:29:52] long
[2:29:55] i don't know how many people come to me
[2:29:57] and say oh i wish that was better i wish
[2:29:59] that could get better i wish things
[2:30:01] could be different i wish things could
[2:30:02] be better i just wish that everybody got
[2:30:05] along i just wish that it wasn't like
[2:30:07] this i wish we could have unity let me
[2:30:10] tell you something there's a key
[2:30:13] get your eyes off the obvious
[2:30:17] get your eyes on jesus
[2:30:22] [Applause]
[2:30:24] leave your bottle at home
[2:30:29] don't you be guilty of putting a bottle
[2:30:31] to your neighbor's mouth in here
[2:30:35] don't you be guilty of petting somebody
[2:30:37] when they're wrong or sympathizing with
[2:30:40] them when they're yielding to demons
[2:30:44] you make up your mind let it blow let it
[2:30:48] go
[2:30:49] whatever comes
[2:30:52] it's my responsibility to keep the fire
[2:30:56] burning on the altar
[2:30:57] you you
[2:30:59] not just mine
[2:31:01] it's our responsibility to make sure
[2:31:04] that the ball keeps rolling
[2:31:06] and i don't mean emotionally i don't
[2:31:08] mean we got to keep each other pumped up
[2:31:10] emotionally i mean a desire and it ain't
[2:31:13] going to be easy
[2:31:15] some of you proved that when you came in
[2:31:16] this morning
[2:31:19] it ain't going to be easy
[2:31:21] because life happens
[2:31:26] and i've been actively involved as
[2:31:27] others have in helping deal with some of
[2:31:30] the witchcraft
[2:31:32] that's trying to harass a servant of god
[2:31:35] who's fighting for his life
[2:31:39] and it is not easy and it's not just an
[2:31:43] extra little prayer that gets the job
[2:31:45] done
[2:31:48] it's warfare it's absolute warfare
[2:31:51] [Music]
[2:31:53] and we need a people to to be sensitive
[2:31:57] to what the spirit of god is doing
[2:32:00] because in the middle of this battle i
[2:32:02] recognized
[2:32:04] that the same kind of harassing spirits
[2:32:08] operate here
[2:32:10] and we
[2:32:12] must
[2:32:13] make up our mind that even if the battle
[2:32:17] is raging jesus is going to be glorified
[2:32:20] in this house and we're going to take
[2:32:22] our sides with the word
[2:32:26] we're going to notify our face and our
[2:32:29] expression and our worship when we come
[2:32:32] to glorify the name of the lord
[2:32:36] and then
[2:32:38] and then maybe there will not be people
[2:32:40] from the outside
[2:32:44] who send notes and emails and text and
[2:32:48] say
[2:32:50] you you your everyone is clear is not
[2:32:54] with you and for you
[2:32:56] because we're streaming the service and
[2:32:58] we can see that there are people that
[2:33:01] are angry with you when you're trying to
[2:33:04] preach
[2:33:05] and even this week somebody sinned and
[2:33:07] said people rolling their eyes
[2:33:10] when you're speaking about supernatural
[2:33:13] things
[2:33:14] well i won't tell you something
[2:33:16] if people out there can recognize it and
[2:33:19] you cannot recognize it
[2:33:22] then we got a big problem
[2:33:25] and if that is truly going on and i have
[2:33:27] no reason to doubt it is it is simply
[2:33:29] because we've allowed the enemy to
[2:33:32] magnify our differences
[2:33:36] we've not cheered for one another
[2:33:39] like we should cheer for one another
[2:33:43] and it breaks down the atmosphere
[2:33:47] and it makes it harder to move forward
[2:33:51] with momentum
[2:33:55] i realize this gets close to home
[2:33:58] i realize that this touches families
[2:34:01] i realize it touches people that we love
[2:34:04] because we love every person in this
[2:34:05] room
[2:34:06] but somebody eventually is going to have
[2:34:09] to make a stand
[2:34:10] and i'm going to have to make that stand
[2:34:15] we've got to find how the enemy is able
[2:34:18] to keep the same old thing stirring and
[2:34:21] stirring and stirring and stir it and
[2:34:23] we've got to be able to deal with that
[2:34:24] because the battle that's raging is
[2:34:26] bigger than this little
[2:34:28] house
[2:34:30] it's a spiritual war
[2:34:32] that's going on across the world
[2:34:35] and the bride of christ is the target of
[2:34:39] an assassination attempt
[2:34:41] and the enemy would like to take you out
[2:34:45] [Applause]
[2:34:46] that don't have to happen
[2:34:50] that don't have to happen you can praise
[2:34:52] your way to victory
[2:34:54] you can get your eyes off of one another
[2:34:57] and get your eyes on jesus christ
[2:35:00] you can discover today you can find out
[2:35:03] today
[2:35:04] if you're carrying a spirit and you
[2:35:06] don't know it
[2:35:07] you can find out today you don't have to
[2:35:10] go another day trying to figure out if
[2:35:12] you're carrying a spirit
[2:35:16] we're not on a picnic
[2:35:19] now i'm going to close in a minute or
[2:35:21] two i want to because i'm getting pretty
[2:35:22] you know it sounds kind of rough and
[2:35:24] rugged and
[2:35:25] that's not what i'm here for
[2:35:27] but i am here to let the enemy know
[2:35:30] now i'm sick and tired
[2:35:33] i'm sick and tired we can turn our heads
[2:35:35] and pretend like
[2:35:36] there's not some there's problems
[2:35:39] and god is the only one who can solve
[2:35:41] the problem but you must be careful
[2:35:44] where you stand
[2:35:50] here's a here's a message that really
[2:35:52] stirs my heart anyway
[2:35:54] it's the message christianity versus
[2:35:56] idolatry
[2:35:58] god give me this verse to go with it
[2:36:00] second corinthians chapter 2 verse 11
[2:36:02] lest satan
[2:36:04] should get an advantage of us for we are
[2:36:07] not ignorant of his devices listen
[2:36:09] satan's not
[2:36:10] he's not the problem this morning i
[2:36:12] don't want you to think that anybody in
[2:36:14] this house i believe satan
[2:36:19] everybody in here even these visitors
[2:36:21] i've already come to love them
[2:36:23] you're god's children
[2:36:26] you're the people of god it's time we
[2:36:27] were acting like it
[2:36:28] but we're the people of god
[2:36:31] this is not a flesh blood battle
[2:36:33] this is a holy ghost spiritual battle
[2:36:37] for those of you that don't believe a
[2:36:38] woman can get anointed to testify don't
[2:36:41] you dare go back and listen to tuesday
[2:36:43] night's service
[2:36:48] because you can get anointed to testify
[2:36:52] there's just one problem sister april
[2:36:55] you pay a price later
[2:36:56] and you will
[2:36:58] if you haven't already you'll pay a
[2:37:00] price
[2:37:02] because what you were warring against
[2:37:05] is not people
[2:37:07] not flesh not blood
[2:37:09] but spirits
[2:37:12] no one could have said it better than
[2:37:14] someone from that generation who lived
[2:37:16] the glory
[2:37:19] who saw the fire
[2:37:20] who saw what god was doing
[2:37:23] even though they're critics who say
[2:37:24] they're just trying to prop up something
[2:37:26] that's already
[2:37:30] oh no if it's that close to collapse and
[2:37:32] let it fall
[2:37:34] if it's that fragile let it fall
[2:37:37] i was out on the road you know preaching
[2:37:39] the pentecostals and charismatics and
[2:37:40] everywhere i was going there say the
[2:37:42] church is dying the church is dying and
[2:37:44] they wanted us to try to breathe life
[2:37:46] into the church that was dying i said oh
[2:37:48] no let her die
[2:37:54] sometimes the leaders would say i don't
[2:37:55] know if you ought to say that or not
[2:37:56] because people are pretty sensitive
[2:37:58] about their church and you get up and
[2:37:59] tell people just let her die i said if
[2:38:01] she's built on man
[2:38:04] she's destined to die
[2:38:07] and until she dies jesus can't raise up
[2:38:10] his church
[2:38:12] come on now
[2:38:13] if this church is built on the on the
[2:38:16] personality
[2:38:18] of brother shelley it'll have to die
[2:38:23] it'd come as close to death in 97 as i
[2:38:26] thought it could ever come
[2:38:30] because god was dealing with some of
[2:38:31] those things
[2:38:33] but if this church today is built on my
[2:38:36] personality it needs to die
[2:38:40] right down to the root
[2:38:43] so that jesus can come
[2:38:45] and establish his work in our midst
[2:38:48] because he's perfect
[2:38:50] preachers ain't people's ain't pastors
[2:38:52] ain't but he is
[2:38:55] so don't you think that i'm busy trying
[2:38:57] to prop up something that god may want
[2:38:59] to bring to a change i want
[2:39:01] transformation from the pulpit to the
[2:39:04] back door
[2:39:05] i want a youth movement going on in this
[2:39:08] house that not that replaces the seniors
[2:39:11] but revives the seniors
[2:39:15] this was the cry
[2:39:17] this was the cry that april was giving
[2:39:20] us tuesday night
[2:39:22] we she said we need you
[2:39:25] we need this
[2:39:28] because some are battle-weary
[2:39:32] too
[2:39:33] intricately intimately involved
[2:39:38] familiar
[2:39:40] we need you we need you we need
[2:39:42] something going on
[2:39:44] i observe some things i'm not calling
[2:39:46] names it was good but i don't want to
[2:39:48] call names but i observe some things by
[2:39:51] streaming back the service of sunday
[2:39:53] morning and i caught some people from
[2:39:55] the back
[2:39:56] because you're on you know i don't want
[2:39:57] to make you feel nervous but you are on
[2:40:00] camera
[2:40:04] the world is seeing you
[2:40:06] you're gonna have a hard time denying
[2:40:09] that you haven't tried to stop
[2:40:11] what god desired to do a time or two and
[2:40:14] i'm looking all over this congregation
[2:40:15] because we've all been guilty
[2:40:17] we didn't feel good
[2:40:21] we had our nose out of joint
[2:40:25] like i said we had fussed with their
[2:40:26] wives
[2:40:29] the children had we'd yelled at the
[2:40:31] children
[2:40:33] god will forgive you honey
[2:40:36] i've been with them
[2:40:40] that's not the way to do it
[2:40:42] but god's not gonna throw you out
[2:40:45] when you get to where you just can't
[2:40:46] take no more on you to say
[2:40:55] they used to say
[2:40:57] i used to know some people up in the
[2:40:58] valley and they used to tell her
[2:41:00] children if you don't stop i'm gonna
[2:41:01] knock you to five points
[2:41:05] my mama used to say if you don't shut
[2:41:07] your mouth i'm gonna knock you into
[2:41:09] tomorrow
[2:41:14] we're not abusing our children
[2:41:18] we're big threats you know
[2:41:20] there's a right way to discipline our
[2:41:21] children in the wrong way and
[2:41:23] mistreating them is not the right way
[2:41:24] and abusing them is not the right way
[2:41:26] and picking up whatever you can get your
[2:41:28] hand on is not the right way
[2:41:30] and discipline them and not telling them
[2:41:32] why they're in trouble and what they can
[2:41:34] do different is not the right way
[2:41:37] that won't work
[2:41:38] it's a it's a full commitment because
[2:41:40] you got to go through the
[2:41:42] whole thing sometime come on now
[2:41:46] don't you allow whatever you're carrying
[2:41:49] in your life to follow you in here to
[2:41:52] such an extent
[2:41:55] that you squash
[2:41:59] your chance
[2:42:01] you know what happens most of the time
[2:42:04] you're afraid you your brother says
[2:42:06] maybe you got to set your wife wife god
[2:42:07] several husbands or children or
[2:42:10] you're afraid to worship the lord
[2:42:13] you're embarrassed to praise the lord
[2:42:15] because you know the family knows the
[2:42:16] conflict that you've had all the way
[2:42:18] over here
[2:42:20] it's a good thing some of you don't live
[2:42:22] too far away
[2:42:25] you don't have too much time to fuss and
[2:42:28] fight and fume against one another
[2:42:30] and you come in here and you're thinking
[2:42:31] oh i wish i could apologize oh i wish i
[2:42:33] could set that straight don't you tell
[2:42:35] me i'm the only one that's ever had that
[2:42:38] oh i wish i could make that right oh i
[2:42:40] wish i i i'm a good of mine just to take
[2:42:42] my wife out right now in the middle of
[2:42:43] the service and say honey i was wrong
[2:42:45] i'm so sorry i let that happen
[2:42:47] there are so many times that people come
[2:42:49] in here and they're fighting that kind
[2:42:51] of condemnation and they won't even try
[2:42:53] to enter in and so you say well i'll get
[2:42:55] that straightened out and by the next
[2:42:57] time i come i'll have my victory again
[2:42:59] folks we ain't got time we don't have
[2:43:01] time for that there may be somebody
[2:43:03] sitting next to you
[2:43:05] whose soul is hanging in the balance
[2:43:11] see if you don't care
[2:43:14] that don't mean everybody doesn't care
[2:43:17] somebody cares
[2:43:19] somebody come out to this place this
[2:43:20] morning because they wanted help
[2:43:23] i don't know why you're inviting people
[2:43:25] i don't know why jesse got invited i
[2:43:27] don't know why david's invited i don't
[2:43:29] know why rachel's invited i don't know
[2:43:30] why some of you invited people here but
[2:43:33] i assume you invited them because you
[2:43:34] hoped
[2:43:36] that a difference could be made in their
[2:43:39] life
[2:43:41] so you don't want to bring them into a
[2:43:43] house
[2:43:44] where so many people have their nose out
[2:43:46] of joint with what all they've been
[2:43:48] going through
[2:43:51] that they're coming here pouting
[2:43:54] and create a rotten atmosphere
[2:43:56] instead of a holy atmosphere
[2:43:58] you don't have to be a hypocrite you
[2:44:00] don't have to run out in the aisle you
[2:44:01] don't have to jump you don't have to do
[2:44:03] anything that you don't want to do but
[2:44:05] the least thing you could do is show a
[2:44:06] right spirit
[2:44:08] when you come into god's house and if
[2:44:10] you can't come in here and show a right
[2:44:11] spirit i have very little use for you
[2:44:13] i'll just be completely honest
[2:44:15] because it's not too much to ask of
[2:44:17] anybody
[2:44:19] to come with the right heart
[2:44:21] and a right spirit
[2:44:23] and to promote and to produce and to
[2:44:26] multiply let something ooze out of you
[2:44:29] besides a mule nature because i want you
[2:44:32] to know that old mule of hee-haw and he
[2:44:35] can make racket and so forth but he has
[2:44:37] no intention
[2:44:38] of doing what the word said
[2:44:40] but god's got a thoroughbred people he's
[2:44:43] got thoroughbreds that come under the
[2:44:45] influence and act like he-haul sometime
[2:44:48] but they just get their course corrected
[2:44:50] because they realize if i can't do it
[2:44:52] for myself if i don't care let me care
[2:44:56] for somebody that does care
[2:44:58] [Applause]
[2:45:01] what kind of a man would want to see his
[2:45:04] wife drug down
[2:45:06] buried down
[2:45:08] weighed it down
[2:45:11] because he is
[2:45:13] what kind of a wife would want her
[2:45:15] husband to be under alone that he
[2:45:18] couldn't break free of because she was
[2:45:24] what kind of a parent would want a child
[2:45:27] to be oppressed
[2:45:30] critical
[2:45:31] bitter
[2:45:33] because they are
[2:45:36] it seems to me like
[2:45:38] you and i
[2:45:39] need to get ourselves out of the way
[2:45:43] and we need to remember
[2:45:45] that some folk really need a
[2:45:49] breakthrough
[2:45:52] where do you find it by responding to
[2:45:54] the word where do you find it by
[2:45:57] gathering in the presence of god around
[2:45:58] the altar and crying out to the lord
[2:46:01] where do you find it by lifting your
[2:46:03] hands into the air and pouring out your
[2:46:05] heart to god god you know i don't feel
[2:46:08] like this
[2:46:10] you know i don't feel like doing this
[2:46:14] with every fiber of my being i don't
[2:46:16] even want to be here but i'm here for
[2:46:17] somebody else
[2:46:20] would you help me to get above all of my
[2:46:23] stuff
[2:46:25] and touch your throne
[2:46:36] christianity versus idolatry
[2:46:38] paragraph 79 he said that's right
[2:46:41] you've got to know the word
[2:46:45] stay on the word
[2:46:48] see the great battle is at hand now
[2:46:52] we've played church for years and years
[2:46:56] but the hour has come now that when
[2:46:59] jamborees and janice will withstand
[2:47:02] moses as the bible said they would and
[2:47:06] it's going to be what
[2:47:14] so you speak ignorantly
[2:47:17] when you go around and say things like i
[2:47:19] wish we could just all get along
[2:47:23] i wish we could just all look look folk
[2:47:26] that ain't the key
[2:47:28] we're not planning thanksgiving dinner
[2:47:31] that's when you need to all get along
[2:47:32] that's not what we're dealing with here
[2:47:34] we're dealing with something
[2:47:37] a thief
[2:47:40] who wants to cheat us
[2:47:42] and rob us out of every prophecy and
[2:47:44] every vision
[2:47:46] and every promise that god has made to
[2:47:48] us and the enemy wants you to train your
[2:47:51] attention and focus on people
[2:47:53] that's the problem people are not the
[2:47:56] problem
[2:47:57] the enemy
[2:48:02] this is a raging battle
[2:48:05] and the battle's bigger than just having
[2:48:07] good services
[2:48:09] are you with me
[2:48:12] this is what disturbs me the most
[2:48:16] i'm going to read this
[2:48:18] this is what disturbs me the most
[2:48:21] he said it's going to be spiritual
[2:48:23] battle conflict there will be some just
[2:48:25] continue on the denominational church
[2:48:28] will just move right on into domination
[2:48:31] and go on the way it goes
[2:48:33] i'm just telling you what a prophet said
[2:48:36] seems to me like it's right
[2:48:40] tattoo parlors in the church
[2:48:44] coffee shops and
[2:48:48] all those things that draw people and
[2:48:50] entertain them big old
[2:48:52] hang up a big buy a big old cooler in
[2:48:55] the
[2:48:56] youth so they can have all the soda pop
[2:48:58] they want and
[2:49:00] all the things they do to pull people
[2:49:02] get all this
[2:49:04] messed up music they sing
[2:49:09] we gotta appeal we gotta draw let me
[2:49:11] tell you something
[2:49:13] that denominational world is just going
[2:49:15] to keep moving on
[2:49:16] they're going to keep making their
[2:49:18] growth and their their
[2:49:20] mega church and they're just going to
[2:49:21] keep right on doing it
[2:49:23] little churches like this are going to
[2:49:25] be condemned because we're not a part of
[2:49:27] the social justice movement because
[2:49:28] we're not a food bank and because we
[2:49:30] don't do this and because we don't do
[2:49:32] that
[2:49:34] and that's because the denominational
[2:49:35] church believes that every church is the
[2:49:37] same and they all should have the same
[2:49:38] commission and they all should do the
[2:49:40] same thing
[2:49:41] and that is not the commission of this
[2:49:43] place that is not what god called us to
[2:49:46] if he should open doors for us to do any
[2:49:48] of that we are i'm willing
[2:49:50] and i believe there are willing people
[2:49:51] here but god told us to feed the bride
[2:49:55] that's what we're trying to do
[2:49:57] if you'll help us we can do it a whole
[2:49:59] lot easier
[2:50:01] and we can't maybe feed them all
[2:50:04] we can go beyond this house
[2:50:07] he's given us the grace to be able to do
[2:50:09] that
[2:50:10] that's right i know this has been a
[2:50:12] little bit tough
[2:50:13] he said it's going to be a spiritual
[2:50:15] battle a conflict there will be some
[2:50:17] just continue on the denominational
[2:50:19] church will just move right on into
[2:50:20] domination and go on the way it goes but
[2:50:22] i mean the real true believer is coming
[2:50:25] to that battlefield
[2:50:27] and you hadn't better be versed
[2:50:31] and know what you're doing
[2:50:34] you better know church look at me please
[2:50:38] you better know what you're doing
[2:50:43] you don't want to run out into a battle
[2:50:46] and not know what you're doing
[2:50:50] because it's possible that the enemy
[2:50:53] would strip you naked
[2:50:59] and hand your clothes back to you
[2:51:04] you want to know what you're doing when
[2:51:07] you run out into the battlefield
[2:51:10] when you're dealing with witchcraft when
[2:51:13] you're dealing with the demonic you want
[2:51:15] to know
[2:51:17] what you're doing
[2:51:19] these are spirits that have tried to
[2:51:21] take us out for years
[2:51:26] and it doesn't matter how much we wished
[2:51:28] it were not so
[2:51:30] we would love for it not to be true the
[2:51:33] truth remains
[2:51:36] that the enemy
[2:51:38] he doesn't take his spirit
[2:51:43] he sometimes changes his tool
[2:51:48] remember what brother braham said in the
[2:51:49] in the holy side
[2:51:52] god may take his man
[2:51:54] but he leaves his spirit
[2:51:56] it works the same way
[2:51:58] when an enemy is dispossessed that
[2:52:02] spirit does not just go away and hide
[2:52:06] it looks to find another vessel to work
[2:52:11] through
[2:52:13] he changes his mask
[2:52:16] through the years
[2:52:18] he's used women
[2:52:23] he uses men
[2:52:26] he uses all
[2:52:28] good precious
[2:52:30] people
[2:52:34] those of you who are afraid to amen your
[2:52:36] cowards
[2:52:38] i'm telling you right now this morning
[2:52:39] if you know i'm speaking the truth and
[2:52:41] you won't put an amen to it you're under
[2:52:43] a cowardly spirit
[2:52:46] why don't you let the enemy know
[2:52:49] it's not people why don't you let the
[2:52:51] enemy know
[2:52:52] where you're going to stand
[2:52:56] there are youth they're young people at
[2:52:58] stake souls at stake deliverances that
[2:53:02] need to take place
[2:53:04] now
[2:53:07] and what does the enemy do just changes
[2:53:09] his mask
[2:53:11] he'll just change his v he'll keep doing
[2:53:13] it too
[2:53:15] until you make up your mind i'm not
[2:53:17] going to be used
[2:53:18] why don't if everybody in this house we
[2:53:21] could solve it all if everybody in this
[2:53:23] house would sincerely repent this
[2:53:25] morning and say i'm not going to be used
[2:53:27] to disturb the atmosphere of a service
[2:53:29] anymore i repent of any part that i have
[2:53:32] played in that and i'm going to ask the
[2:53:34] lord to let me be an asset to this
[2:53:37] church
[2:53:39] instead of a constant dream
[2:53:41] i'm going to ask the lord to let me give
[2:53:47] it's vital
[2:53:50] it's vital
[2:53:51] let me finish this quote
[2:53:54] he said but i mean the real true
[2:53:55] believers come into the battlefield
[2:53:57] you're there you're there whether you
[2:54:00] want to be or not
[2:54:01] musicians are coming please
[2:54:03] and you had better be versed and know
[2:54:06] what you're doing
[2:54:07] i was about to make a bad mistake
[2:54:11] this week
[2:54:16] the cry had gone out
[2:54:18] would you get some
[2:54:20] folks together and come and walk the
[2:54:22] property line of our our house our place
[2:54:24] our property here
[2:54:26] and and
[2:54:27] pray over
[2:54:28] all these harassing things that are
[2:54:30] taking place
[2:54:32] and my heart was actively engaged in the
[2:54:34] battle and i know that that i've had to
[2:54:37] do that before and you have to how many
[2:54:38] of you have ever had to take authority
[2:54:40] over your own home
[2:54:44] did the spirits come back
[2:54:49] if they did we let them
[2:54:52] because the same one that had power to
[2:54:54] cause them to leave to make them leave
[2:54:55] is the one that has the power to guard
[2:54:57] the door
[2:54:59] and keep them out be careful what you
[2:55:01] watch be careful what you pull in be
[2:55:02] careful what you listen to be careful
[2:55:04] what you read be careful what you say
[2:55:05] about other people
[2:55:07] because all of these things create an
[2:55:09] environment for the enemy to thrive
[2:55:12] instead of the holy ghost to thrive
[2:55:14] i've allowed the enemy to intimidate me
[2:55:16] about something that i do know a little
[2:55:18] something about and that's deliverance
[2:55:21] and i've stayed off the subject because
[2:55:23] every time i do it stirs the enemy and
[2:55:26] it causes other people not to know where
[2:55:27] to stand
[2:55:29] but we have come to a place now where we
[2:55:32] got to get this thing right
[2:55:34] because we got a snowball or a fireball
[2:55:36] or a momentum or whatever you want to
[2:55:38] call it and i want to see somebody
[2:55:40] running along behind it with a finger
[2:55:42] saying r roll on
[2:55:45] roll on
[2:55:48] let's give the devil no space
[2:55:51] let's give him no room
[2:55:55] let's everyone repent
[2:55:57] that's all just repent
[2:55:59] and get it over with you
[2:56:01] it would make a world of difference
[2:56:04] oh it sounds like it's a rough place
[2:56:05] around here
[2:56:07] just on occasion it's not what i meant
[2:56:10] but i mean the real true believers
[2:56:11] coming to that battlefield and you'd
[2:56:13] better be verse i was about to make a
[2:56:15] bad mistake
[2:56:16] because i was about to go seal in
[2:56:20] some tormenting spirits
[2:56:23] because i was going to walk that
[2:56:25] perimeter of that line the borders of
[2:56:27] that house that yard and i was going to
[2:56:29] apply the blood i believe we have
[2:56:30] authority to do so i was going to apply
[2:56:32] the blood and plead the name of jesus
[2:56:34] the blood of jesus and and get that all
[2:56:36] sealed in
[2:56:38] and i'd prayed so hard that day i'd
[2:56:40] i i would need i i just really needed to
[2:56:43] hear from god
[2:56:45] i needed to get me out of the way
[2:56:48] and i woke up that next morning and he
[2:56:50] started dealing with me he said you'd be
[2:56:52] trapping those harassing spirits
[2:56:58] you've got to make sure everything is
[2:56:59] cleansed and there's not an open door
[2:57:04] i believe that goes for this house
[2:57:06] i'm talking about something i dealt with
[2:57:08] for friends this week but i believe it
[2:57:10] goes for this house here we are trying
[2:57:12] to seal the perimeter in the border and
[2:57:14] yet if there's an open door if
[2:57:16] somebody's standing in the door and
[2:57:17] allowing those harassing spirits to come
[2:57:19] in and out and harass and do their
[2:57:21] little dirty works
[2:57:22] just
[2:57:28] it's just
[2:57:29] noise just noise
[2:57:32] that the enemy likes to make
[2:57:35] and so the lord said don't you do that
[2:57:39] i'll tell you what to say
[2:57:42] now
[2:57:44] i'm i'm not i'm i'm not an expert
[2:57:47] i've yielded the things that
[2:57:50] god's had to help me with
[2:57:52] but i know a little bit about
[2:57:53] deliverance
[2:57:55] i know a little bit about demon spirits
[2:57:58] and i've allowed myself to be a little
[2:58:00] intimidated at times because i know
[2:58:02] there are folks who think
[2:58:05] that there's a that i think because
[2:58:07] they've said it that there's a demon
[2:58:09] behind everything
[2:58:11] under every rock and i want you to know
[2:58:13] nothing could be further from the truth
[2:58:15] but it becomes the nature of of of a
[2:58:18] person
[2:58:20] to
[2:58:22] not want to see
[2:58:24] what the real root is
[2:58:27] and so you start trying
[2:58:29] to repair
[2:58:31] and you start hoping to make a
[2:58:33] difference
[2:58:34] and you start thinking if i do this it
[2:58:36] will send this message and this will
[2:58:39] help and this will cause this to happen
[2:58:41] and so forth and a month rocks on in
[2:58:43] months rock on in years rock on and
[2:58:45] nothing is any different because the
[2:58:47] problem has never really completely been
[2:58:49] dealt with
[2:58:51] and we know enough from the message of
[2:58:53] the hour somebody i've even had people
[2:58:55] say won't you just deal with that spirit
[2:58:57] why don't you just deal with that well
[2:58:59] we know enough about what brother
[2:59:00] branham taught us about deliverance that
[2:59:02] number one the person has got to
[2:59:03] recognize that they've yielded to
[2:59:05] something
[2:59:06] they've got to repent of that
[2:59:09] and be willing to make it right i'm
[2:59:10] telling you that is hard to do
[2:59:13] number one and number two you've got to
[2:59:15] make sure that that person is not making
[2:59:17] a god out of the very spirit that drives
[2:59:20] them
[2:59:22] because brother branham talked about the
[2:59:23] maniac
[2:59:24] [Music]
[2:59:25] and he said he worshipped that spirit
[2:59:29] now i don't believe anybody is going to
[2:59:30] bow down and say holy to a false spirit
[2:59:33] but what we will do is yield to that
[2:59:35] until it becomes our truth
[2:59:38] and it's the only truth we can hear
[2:59:40] and when we do that we give that demon a
[2:59:42] voice in our life that only prevents us
[2:59:46] from coming to pure deliverance
[2:59:49] this is what we must not let happen
[2:59:52] he said you'd better be versed and know
[2:59:54] what you're doing and i confess there
[2:59:56] are times i don't i almost made a mess
[2:59:59] this week
[3:00:01] are you listen
[3:00:03] you would better be versed and know what
[3:00:04] you're doing or you could take
[3:00:07] you could take
[3:00:08] an evil spirit so easy
[3:00:13] and not know
[3:00:17] this is the danger
[3:00:20] transference of spirits
[3:00:22] this is the danger
[3:00:25] if you try to stand between the word and
[3:00:28] the spirit
[3:00:30] you're keeping
[3:00:32] deliverance at bay
[3:00:34] if you'll get out of the way
[3:00:37] and let the holy ghost do the work
[3:00:40] those of you who have said i don't see
[3:00:42] no way for some things to ever be
[3:00:43] settled or ever be made right or ever be
[3:00:46] straightened out or ever be better than
[3:00:48] they are right now you're not giving
[3:00:49] much room
[3:00:52] for what the holy ghost can do
[3:00:54] you're not giving god much room to work
[3:00:57] seem to me like you may be putting the
[3:00:59] spirit between you and you
[3:01:01] seem to me like you may be putting a
[3:01:02] little more power on the spirit than you
[3:01:04] should let me tell you something god
[3:01:06] knows how
[3:01:08] he can deliver us
[3:01:10] he can take those who are insane
[3:01:12] and put them in their right mind then he
[3:01:15] sure can deal with harassing spirits
[3:01:18] because the lord showed me these these
[3:01:20] things are harassing spirits and they
[3:01:22] can only operate where there's a root
[3:01:25] they can't put something on us
[3:01:28] and if you get confused by what i'm
[3:01:30] saying i'll be glad to bring you another
[3:01:31] session on this and i can go through the
[3:01:34] scriptures and the quotes where brother
[3:01:36] branham talked about the difference in
[3:01:37] demon oppression and demon possession
[3:01:40] he was clear
[3:01:42] it's one thing to be oppressed by a
[3:01:44] demon from the outside
[3:01:46] it's another thing to be driven by a
[3:01:48] demon from the inside
[3:01:50] most believers who fall under the
[3:01:52] influence of a spirit are oppressed of a
[3:01:55] devil not possessed of a devil
[3:01:58] therefore the deliverance should
[3:02:00] actually be easier in the presence of
[3:02:02] repentance
[3:02:04] there's no reason why a believer should
[3:02:06] have to struggle for years to get free
[3:02:09] of an oppressing spirit
[3:02:15] brother branham dealt with these things
[3:02:17] in the
[3:02:18] in the uh prayer lines and
[3:02:20] hunter and i were searching trying to
[3:02:22] find some of the things that brother
[3:02:23] brown said because would you believe for
[3:02:25] instance one of the things that brother
[3:02:28] dwayne jackson preached to us about was
[3:02:30] depression well you know brother branham
[3:02:31] said very little
[3:02:33] about depression
[3:02:38] most of the time
[3:02:40] uh he was talking about
[3:02:42] the period of time he lived in
[3:02:44] the depression
[3:02:46] but he said tons of things about being
[3:02:49] pressed down
[3:02:50] oppressed nervous
[3:02:54] you're real nervous
[3:02:57] you just get yourself worked up
[3:03:01] into a hissy
[3:03:03] or a tether
[3:03:04] now god wants to set you free from that
[3:03:09] and that could have been a number of
[3:03:10] spirits anxiety depression or whatever
[3:03:13] could have been a number of things but
[3:03:14] brother branham simplified it and put
[3:03:16] them under pretty big categories
[3:03:18] because stress was not a word they used
[3:03:20] so much and depression was not a word
[3:03:22] they used so much
[3:03:23] but he gave us some very powerful
[3:03:25] instructions about the difference
[3:03:27] between demons
[3:03:28] operating in the physical dimension
[3:03:32] and demon spirits operating in the
[3:03:34] spiritual dimension
[3:03:37] the physical dimension take form
[3:03:40] like a familiar spirit
[3:03:42] will take form
[3:03:44] it will crea it will not create a form
[3:03:47] but it hijacks
[3:03:49] a form
[3:03:51] a witch can carry all kinds of demon
[3:03:55] spirits
[3:03:57] that can operate through that witch
[3:04:00] but a lot of what's accomplished for
[3:04:02] darkness
[3:04:03] is not accomplished by that that
[3:04:05] possesses that that woman or man
[3:04:09] but it's by the familiar that works with
[3:04:11] them
[3:04:13] because that familiar spirit can go here
[3:04:15] and there and everywhere
[3:04:20] it can move beyond physical walls and
[3:04:23] and and bodies and so forth it can
[3:04:26] change its form it can take on any any
[3:04:29] form
[3:04:30] that it can find it can get a hold of
[3:04:33] and those kind of spirits sometimes will
[3:04:35] spy
[3:04:36] does that sound too crazy
[3:04:39] spy
[3:04:41] and then go back and report to the
[3:04:43] person working the witchcraft things
[3:04:45] that that person would have no way of
[3:04:48] knowing
[3:04:51] and they use that knowledge that they
[3:04:53] have gained about you to make you think
[3:04:56] that it's the operation of a spiritual
[3:04:58] gift of intercession
[3:05:01] when it was nothing in the world but a
[3:05:03] familiar spirit spying out the land to
[3:05:05] see what needed to be told just enough
[3:05:08] to catch your attention
[3:05:10] so that you would yield to that thing
[3:05:13] you got victory you don't have to be a
[3:05:14] pawn
[3:05:16] you don't have to be upon in in the
[3:05:18] devil's uh
[3:05:20] business do you the real true believers
[3:05:22] come into that battlefield and you'd
[3:05:24] better be versed and know what you're
[3:05:26] doing or you could take an evil spirit
[3:05:28] so easy and not know if it's contrary to
[3:05:31] this word don't believe it stay
[3:05:34] with that
[3:05:35] word
[3:05:37] and here's what i want to leave you with
[3:05:39] i
[3:05:40] i know this has been strange for some
[3:05:44] thank you
[3:05:48] this has
[3:05:49] i only have one motive
[3:05:51] in reading this quote and that's
[3:05:53] magnifying the truth
[3:05:55] i don't have any self-serving motive
[3:05:57] here at all god knows that but i want to
[3:06:00] read this
[3:06:02] needs to be read on occasion it needs to
[3:06:04] be read from time to time
[3:06:06] we need at times we need positive things
[3:06:10] spoken about the leadership of the
[3:06:11] church
[3:06:16] needs to be spoken sometime
[3:06:19] just to kind of balance things out
[3:06:22] but that's not particularly what this is
[3:06:24] about except that last little paragraph
[3:06:25] but paragraph 80 love one another
[3:06:33] above everything love one another
[3:06:36] i want you to know that
[3:06:39] if you see a need and you s you
[3:06:41] sacrifice your life
[3:06:44] to pray for that need that is a
[3:06:46] demonstration of love
[3:06:49] there are times that you may not be able
[3:06:51] to extend
[3:06:54] a
[3:06:55] physical manifestation of the love you
[3:06:57] feel for that person there'll be others
[3:06:59] who can
[3:07:00] but i want you to know this greatest
[3:07:02] thing that you can do for somebody who's
[3:07:04] in trouble or who needs help is pray for
[3:07:07] them and you will serve them better by
[3:07:10] praying god's perfect will be done
[3:07:13] instead of telling god what needs to be
[3:07:15] done
[3:07:16] because we can be a mile off
[3:07:19] 10 miles off
[3:07:21] love one another above everything love
[3:07:23] one another no matter what the devil
[3:07:25] tries to say oh it's late
[3:07:27] now you're all one big great sweet group
[3:07:30] now but remember my warning
[3:07:33] satan won't let that stay that way no
[3:07:36] sir he'll shoot everything
[3:07:38] if he has to bring somebody in to make
[3:07:40] his target
[3:07:42] notice that
[3:07:44] notice that don't you misunderstand that
[3:07:45] quote because you can read right over
[3:07:47] that and miss it
[3:07:49] he didn't say bring somebody in and make
[3:07:52] them the troublemaker
[3:07:56] he said bring somebody in and make them
[3:07:58] the target
[3:08:01] the enemy will use whoever he can use
[3:08:04] and if you're already struggling with
[3:08:06] depression or already struggling with
[3:08:09] uncertainty or if you're already
[3:08:10] struggling with whether or not your call
[3:08:13] is from the lord
[3:08:15] you become vulnerable enough
[3:08:18] that the enemy can work his way it's
[3:08:20] it's really wrong it's
[3:08:22] it ought to make every one of us angry
[3:08:24] that the enemy takes such advantage of
[3:08:26] people when they're already in a
[3:08:28] struggling place but he does
[3:08:31] and the only thing you might be able to
[3:08:33] do is help them now
[3:08:34] by prayer don't no matter what the devil
[3:08:36] tries to say now you're all one great
[3:08:39] big sweet group now but remember my
[3:08:40] warning see satan won't let that stay
[3:08:42] that way no sir he'll shoot everything
[3:08:45] if he has to bring somebody in to make
[3:08:48] his target
[3:08:50] you see that he'll bring some critic
[3:08:54] or unbeliever we're reading on now
[3:08:59] in and set him down and cause him to
[3:09:01] fellowship with you
[3:09:03] under the quietness and things and then
[3:09:06] he'll shoot that guy
[3:09:08] making him the target satan is
[3:09:11] with some kind of a poison stuff
[3:09:14] and he'll start through the church with
[3:09:15] it
[3:09:16] i think that'd be satan
[3:09:18] brother bannon may be talking about the
[3:09:20] man yielding to that and carrying that
[3:09:22] around tails around but i think that
[3:09:25] that the enemy the real enemy needs to
[3:09:27] always be satan we need to always see
[3:09:30] that he's the one that's trying to
[3:09:32] operate
[3:09:34] and he'll start through the church with
[3:09:35] it now let's read on one more time i
[3:09:37] think don't you take sides with it
[3:09:43] you will starve the spirit out
[3:09:48] if you leave it be
[3:09:51] if you don't have power to bring
[3:09:52] deliverance if you don't have power
[3:09:55] to help set somebody free if you don't
[3:09:57] have a voice if you don't have the
[3:09:59] opportunity to do something for them
[3:10:01] then call as little attention to that
[3:10:03] kind of a spirit as possible i wish to
[3:10:06] as a pastor i had that privilege
[3:10:10] but when you see the thing beginning to
[3:10:12] move from person to person to person
[3:10:14] then you have no choice
[3:10:15] but to do something about it
[3:10:18] don't take sides with it
[3:10:22] you can love people without building the
[3:10:24] spirit up in them
[3:10:26] feeding the spirit in them
[3:10:29] legitimate legitimizing the spirit
[3:10:31] that's in them
[3:10:34] you say to somebody like that i get your
[3:10:36] point i understand where you're coming
[3:10:38] from and you don't know what you've done
[3:10:40] you have no idea what you've really done
[3:10:43] you stay right loving and sweet and kind
[3:10:46] to one another which we have not always
[3:10:48] been
[3:10:50] pray for that man
[3:10:52] that he'll be saved too or that woman or
[3:10:54] ever who it is just pray for them
[3:10:57] and stick
[3:10:58] one with another.
[3:11:04] and here's what i said
[3:11:07] i i think it needs to be said sometime
[3:11:09] but i don't want to say it in a
[3:11:10] self-serving way and stay with your
[3:11:13] pastor
[3:11:16] it's important
[3:11:18] if you cannot stay with your pastor you
[3:11:21] are duty bound to find a pastor
[3:11:24] that you can stand with
[3:11:31] see he's the shepherd
[3:11:33] and you give him respects
[3:11:35] he'll lead you through and cause
[3:11:38] and cause he's ordained of god to do so
[3:11:43] if you're a person who no longer
[3:11:45] believes
[3:11:47] that god can use me as your pastor
[3:11:51] then you have a decision to make
[3:11:55] and you need to make it
[3:11:57] my desire
[3:11:59] is to see this body strong
[3:12:02] and to see it intact
[3:12:04] come on now
[3:12:06] but according to the message of the hour
[3:12:09] it's vitally important i think that
[3:12:11] anybody who's worked in management i
[3:12:13] think anybody who's worked with a group
[3:12:15] of people under them or with them or on
[3:12:18] a leadership team will understand the
[3:12:21] importance of having
[3:12:23] a unified leadership moving forward with
[3:12:26] a goal and having a people behind you
[3:12:29] don't have to think everything your
[3:12:31] leadership does is right i can save you
[3:12:34] the scrutiny
[3:12:36] i'm more of a man than most
[3:12:40] when i mean that i don't just mean my
[3:12:42] weight
[3:12:44] i mean i struggle like every other human
[3:12:48] being struggles
[3:12:50] and if you're looking for my mistakes
[3:12:52] you won't have to have a microscope
[3:12:56] but here's something you do need to know
[3:12:59] i have stood the test of time
[3:13:02] i have caused this church to move
[3:13:04] forward toward the word
[3:13:07] i have praised the lord no matter who
[3:13:10] was singing
[3:13:12] no matter who was worshiping
[3:13:15] no matter who was preaching
[3:13:18] i have done my best to support and push
[3:13:21] this thing forward
[3:13:23] and i will continue to do that
[3:13:26] but you need to understand
[3:13:28] there is a battle raging and it is a
[3:13:32] spiritual battle it can only be dealt
[3:13:35] with in the spirit by the spirit
[3:13:38] somebody said surely you're not going to
[3:13:40] leave this out there on the internet i
[3:13:42] absolutely am
[3:13:46] because
[3:13:47] i haven't said anything here that
[3:13:49] couldn't apply to any other group of
[3:13:53] people i didn't even start out to preach
[3:13:55] about our local church only
[3:13:58] i started out to say that a battle is
[3:14:01] raging and you don't want to be caught
[3:14:04] up in the storm
[3:14:07] you want to be able to recognize those
[3:14:10] harassing spirits
[3:14:12] and shut them off
[3:14:14] or they will run you silly
[3:14:19] they will run you absolutely silly
[3:14:23] i want you to know there's victory in
[3:14:24] jesus
[3:14:25] there's a way out of every tight
[3:14:27] situation you may find yourself in
[3:14:30] there's a way to be free
[3:14:32] you don't have to be bound
[3:14:35] you don't have to be miserable
[3:14:38] you don't have to wither away
[3:14:40] spiritually
[3:14:41] you can press in to the fullness of all
[3:14:45] that the holy ghost has for you and he
[3:14:48] does i don't see anybody in this house
[3:14:51] that he doesn't have something for
[3:14:55] if you'll get yourself out of the way
[3:14:58] and press into him
[3:15:00] how do you know i haven't
[3:15:08] if you're worse off than you were a year
[3:15:09] ago today
[3:15:12] you tell me
[3:15:16] if you're heavier more burdened more
[3:15:19] miserable
[3:15:20] than you were two years ago you tell me
[3:15:25] somebody has a pardon
[3:15:27] that has been written out in your name
[3:15:30] and the blood of jesus christ has been
[3:15:32] shed to set you completely and totally
[3:15:35] free from that spirit
[3:15:37] i've seen that thing standing years back
[3:15:39] right over and there i saw that thing
[3:15:41] standing behind some of the young people
[3:15:43] of this church
[3:15:45] i'm going to tell you something when the
[3:15:47] enemy can come in a house of god like
[3:15:49] that
[3:15:50] and stand over us like that that's
[3:15:51] something
[3:15:54] that'll really get you
[3:15:56] anybody ever had your house broken into
[3:15:59] or your car broken into
[3:16:01] i don't
[3:16:03] well i
[3:16:04] we had a had a break-in in jerusalem
[3:16:07] we had a break in here
[3:16:11] uh what was that
[3:16:13] indiana
[3:16:15] oh when we went to the wedding
[3:16:18] and they busted the window out
[3:16:20] and uh
[3:16:21] they would have stolen all kinds of
[3:16:23] stuff but we didn't have a gun and
[3:16:25] and the people that come out said they
[3:16:27] were looking for guns to run in the drug
[3:16:29] drug trade there but they did bust the
[3:16:31] wind of the vehicle
[3:16:32] but people that have had someone going
[3:16:34] through their drawers at home their
[3:16:36] shelves and cabinets and stuff and and
[3:16:38] having people toss their stuff around
[3:16:40] they tell me that that's one of the most
[3:16:42] awful feelings you feel so violated
[3:16:46] that the enemy could come into your
[3:16:48] house when you're not there and go
[3:16:50] through your stuff like that and look
[3:16:52] over your underwear drawer
[3:16:54] looking for jewelry or whatever
[3:16:58] and you all were in your place
[3:17:00] when somebody broke
[3:17:01] well that'll make you want to whoop the
[3:17:03] devil
[3:17:04] come on now
[3:17:07] and that anger that kind of arises first
[3:17:09] fear and grief and all the different
[3:17:11] things and then an anger that says i
[3:17:13] tell you what
[3:17:14] you better be careful when you come the
[3:17:16] next time
[3:17:18] something rises up in you
[3:17:19] every one of us should have something
[3:17:22] like that a passion that rises up in us
[3:17:25] and says wait a minute enemy
[3:17:27] wait a minute you dirty devil
[3:17:29] you've messed with my life long enough
[3:17:32] you've twisted my emotions long enough
[3:17:36] you have perverted my reality long
[3:17:39] enough
[3:17:40] your lies have bombarded me long enough
[3:17:45] and i'm raising up to do something about
[3:17:47] it
[3:17:48] and i want to tell you something else
[3:17:49] every one of you that recognizes that
[3:17:51] the enemy would not only do that to you
[3:17:53] or to your family or to your home but
[3:17:55] also to your church
[3:17:59] you ought to rise up with all the
[3:18:00] passion you can muster turn every arrow
[3:18:03] you've got and now every air and every
[3:18:05] bullet we've got is in this word and
[3:18:08] turn every bit of that against the enemy
[3:18:10] and let him know
[3:18:13] no more
[3:18:14] no
[3:18:15] more
[3:18:16] we're not going to let this battle keep
[3:18:18] us from receiving everything we got let
[3:18:21] these young people that i mean i've seen
[3:18:23] not just heard testimony i've seen
[3:18:25] changes and differences in people's
[3:18:28] lives and all i want all i really want
[3:18:31] is to see you running behind the ball of
[3:18:33] fire
[3:18:34] keep running
[3:18:35] roll on roll on roll on roll on we don't
[3:18:39] want you to diminish
[3:18:41] there's an enemy here that would like to
[3:18:44] steal your praise there's an enemy
[3:18:47] there's an enemy in the earth that would
[3:18:49] like to keep you from praising the lord
[3:18:53] bind you up and steal your freedom
[3:18:56] steal your joy
[3:18:58] this is his intent
[3:19:02] this is what he's after
[3:19:04] [Applause]
[3:19:07] you
[3:19:08] have the power
[3:19:10] to say no more
[3:19:12] lead us in worship come on let's worship
[3:19:14] the lord for just a moment
[3:19:16] let's create an atmosphere where every
[3:19:18] one of us can say there's a battle
[3:19:20] raging but i know who the victory is
[3:19:23] oh it's jesus christ
[3:19:26] living inside of me living inside of the
[3:19:29] believer he's the victory he conquered
[3:19:32] death hell and the grave
[3:19:34] [Music]
[3:19:36] defeated you're defeated
[3:19:39] oh let's push this thing on
[3:19:42] let's run with momentum
[3:19:45] hallelujah
[3:19:47] i know this has been the heart's cry
[3:19:49] of of the of the uh
[3:19:51] mature
[3:19:53] seniors and believers in this church
[3:19:56] god would stir
[3:19:58] a revival in the young people
[3:20:00] we've done all we've known to do we
[3:20:02] brought somebody to help we prayed we
[3:20:05] prepared we gave we sacrificed and now
[3:20:08] it's time that we tend
[3:20:13] we tend it
[3:20:17] it's like josiah
[3:20:20] and luke
[3:20:23] yovich
[3:20:24] poking that fire
[3:20:27] the ashes a little bit
[3:20:30] letting a little oxygen catch under
[3:20:31] there
[3:20:32] i tell you it was not a pl it was not
[3:20:34] for pleasure
[3:20:36] started out being
[3:20:37] for pleasure
[3:20:39] it ended up being for warmth
[3:20:44] there was a lot of playing going on a
[3:20:45] lot of volleyball going on and if
[3:20:47] somebody would have forgotten us in the
[3:20:49] fire around the fire that knew what they
[3:20:51] were doing we'd have been colder than we
[3:20:53] were
[3:20:54] but somebody came back
[3:20:57] and poked around and
[3:21:00] i'm not going to mention david i give
[3:21:02] him a real hard time
[3:21:04] because what he thought he was doing to
[3:21:06] help i'm not sure i'm sorry david
[3:21:09] i'm not sure that was helping but
[3:21:11] i give you a for effort and the fact
[3:21:14] that you cared
[3:21:18] there was an old stump that sat out
[3:21:20] there for i don't know how long and we
[3:21:22] run out of wood and and luke just
[3:21:25] started splitting that
[3:21:27] big old stump he found a way to keep the
[3:21:30] fire fueled
[3:21:32] and the ember stoked
[3:21:34] and if you think a pastor and an
[3:21:36] associate pastor can do that alone
[3:21:40] if you think a worship leader can do
[3:21:42] that alone if you think musicians or a
[3:21:44] staff can do that alone we cannot
[3:21:48] it takes everybody doing
[3:21:50] something
[3:21:52] serving
[3:21:56] if you can't put something up you can
[3:21:58] help take it down
[3:22:01] if you can't help cook a pie you can
[3:22:03] help wipe the table when the pie is
[3:22:06] eaten
[3:22:07] there's something that everybody can do
[3:22:11] to make the best effort
[3:22:14] to keep this thing moving
[3:22:17] i remember one time there was a stirring
[3:22:19] among the young people and there was an
[3:22:21] older sister she wasn't really that old
[3:22:23] she was just married and had small some
[3:22:26] small children and some teenage children
[3:22:28] and we were having a we were having a uh
[3:22:33] uh uh an assembly for the school
[3:22:36] and uh we were talking and preaching a
[3:22:38] little bit about the youth and putting
[3:22:40] some it well it was a youth meeting
[3:22:43] and we were putting emphasis on the
[3:22:45] young people
[3:22:46] and that woman was walking through the
[3:22:48] back of the church and she heard the
[3:22:50] emphasis on the young people and it
[3:22:52] struck a place in her
[3:22:55] and made her jealous
[3:22:58] she later had to come and repent and say
[3:23:01] i let such a jealousy it seemed to me
[3:23:04] like you were lifting the young people
[3:23:06] up
[3:23:07] and putting the young people down i mean
[3:23:09] the young people out putting the old
[3:23:11] people down i said you no no no no no no
[3:23:14] no no
[3:23:15] i was lifting the young people up you're
[3:23:16] right
[3:23:17] i wasn't putting nobody down
[3:23:20] that's how you felt
[3:23:21] that's where you were
[3:23:23] that's how you'd already been feeling
[3:23:25] and somehow that over that'll come come
[3:23:27] on you and you thought that we were
[3:23:29] there to put the old people down not at
[3:23:31] all
[3:23:32] of course
[3:23:34] the ones that are older now wasn't older
[3:23:35] then
[3:23:37] that was years ago
[3:23:39] i could see how the enemy used
[3:23:41] what was already in that woman she
[3:23:44] thought we were having a rally against

[3:29:46] [Music]
[3:29:51] now here's our chance
[3:29:53] here's our chance we're standing around
[3:29:56] [Music]
[3:29:57] you don't have to reach very far
[3:30:00] to find somebody that loves you
[3:30:03] in this altar today
[3:30:05] [Music]
[3:30:07] and if there's anybody against you they
[3:30:09] better get it right
[3:30:11] because there's no reason
[3:30:13] for any of us to be against anybody
[3:30:16] who's standing around this altar
[3:30:18] these are god's children the ones he
[3:30:20] died for the ones he paid the price for
[3:30:24] it's not what this is about
[3:30:26] so you may feel alone but you are not
[3:30:29] standing here alone
[3:30:32] what you've done is you've gathered in
[3:30:35] his name without being called
[3:30:38] now
[3:30:40] i can't do it for you you can't do it
[3:30:42] for me
[3:30:45] you're going to have to say lord help me
[3:30:47] i'm sorry and i'm going to have to say
[3:30:49] the same thing
[3:30:52] there's just certain things we can't do
[3:30:54] for one another and repentance is one of
[3:30:56] them
[3:30:57] but it's the only way to start again
[3:31:00] you say well i already have look do it
[3:31:02] again the best thing to do is just stay
[3:31:04] in that attitude
[3:31:06] like the church age book said be just
[3:31:08] just be willing to scream out i was
[3:31:10] wrong i'm sorry and mean it
[3:31:13] and don't let the enemy talk you out of
[3:31:15] it
[3:31:16] he'll be busy with that after a while
[3:31:20] shut him up right now
[3:31:22] you tell the lord about it right now
[3:31:25] just bow your head and you tell the lord
[3:31:27] if there's anything in your heart that
[3:31:29] needs to be made right before him
[3:31:32] you tell him right now
[3:31:35] he's the only one that can do anything
[3:31:36] about it if you're carrying something
[3:31:41] if you have yielded yourself and you
[3:31:43] recognize it
[3:31:44] [Music]
[3:31:45] to an enemy that's really bigger
[3:31:49] than this little house
[3:31:51] and you want to cut off your
[3:31:53] relationship with that spirit and say no
[3:31:55] more you're going to have to find
[3:31:56] somebody else to use i'm done i'm done
[3:31:59] being a pawn of the devil i'm done being
[3:32:01] used to sow discord i'm done i'm done
[3:32:05] reigning on the parade in fact i'm gonna
[3:32:09] i want to be part of the solution
[3:32:11] and i want god to use me to help unify
[3:32:14] and draw
[3:32:16] the army together
[3:32:17] you tell the lord right now
[3:32:20] i can't pray for you i got to pray for
[3:32:21] myself but you pray right now and if
[3:32:24] we're gathered here in an atmosphere of
[3:32:26] love for one another there's no reason
[3:32:28] why we can't touch him when we pray here
[3:32:30] we are lord
[3:32:33] here we are lord your word has
[3:32:35] challenged us
[3:32:37] it's corrected us
[3:32:39] it's pulled us
[3:32:42] and lord here we stand today recognizing
[3:32:46] that in any situation of life
[3:32:49] it's impossible
[3:32:51] to be 100 right all the time
[3:32:55] so there's bound to be times
[3:32:58] that i have yielded
[3:33:00] to the wrong spirit
[3:33:02] there's bound to be times that i have
[3:33:05] misspoken
[3:33:06] that i have misjudged
[3:33:08] there's bound to be times that i've
[3:33:10] allowed the enemy to use me instead of
[3:33:13] the holy ghost but i stand lord before
[3:33:16] you today repenting and saying father
[3:33:20] you're the only hope we have for a
[3:33:22] better way

[3:33:25] to correct the course
[3:33:28] to push
[3:33:29] our young people forward
[3:33:31] into what you have started doing in
[3:33:33] their lives
[3:33:35] life-changing
[3:33:37] moves of god that go beyond the feeling
[3:33:40] of the flesh
[3:33:42] that go down into the very inner being
[3:33:44] to the root
[3:33:46] and start ministering to that
[3:33:50] i'm asking you right now to participate
[3:33:54] because you just pour this out to the
[3:33:56] lord do it you don't have to be loud

[4:30:52] [Music]
[4:30:58] as we were clapping
[4:31:00] the drums were playing my mind went to
[4:31:04] the scripture that
[4:31:06] talks about the three
[4:31:08] i believe it was three leprous men and
[4:31:10] they were hungry
[4:31:11] but they weren't allowed inside of the
[4:31:13] city
[4:31:14] they weren't allowed to get anything to
[4:31:16] eat
[4:31:18] and they finally said they knew the
[4:31:20] syrian army was over camped against
[4:31:23] their city
[4:31:24] and they finally said why sit we here
[4:31:29] till we die
[4:31:32] if we go to the city we're going to die
[4:31:34] because they're all starving already
[4:31:37] if we go to the syrian army maybe
[4:31:39] they'll at least give us something to
[4:31:40] eat but why sit we here till we die
[4:31:45] but what i was going to get to was when
[4:31:48] they got to the syrian army camp
[4:31:52] the syrians were already gone
[4:31:57] the camp was empty
[4:32:00] why was the camp empty because that god
[4:32:03] had sent a noise
[4:32:06] down through their camp that sounded
[4:32:09] like a bunch of horses coming toward
[4:32:12] them
[4:32:13] [Applause]
[4:32:14] and when we started clapping i don't
[4:32:16] know whether you paid attention to it
[4:32:19] but as more people joined their clap
[4:32:22] there was a different sound in it it
[4:32:26] raised the sound
[4:32:29] this is the same thing that we've been
[4:32:31] talking about for years the sound how
[4:32:34] that that sound can change the
[4:32:36] atmosphere you may not be saying
[4:32:38] anything out of your mouth but your your
[4:32:41] willingness to join in the clapping and
[4:32:44] taking it to another level friends the
[4:32:47] devil's on the run
[4:32:49] the devil's on the run
[4:32:55] [Music]
[4:32:57] [Applause]
[4:33:00] now it's our job to keep him on the run
[4:33:04] keep him running
[4:33:07] if you've got a shout if you've got a
[4:33:09] scream if you've got to clap your hands
[4:33:12] if you need on to turn on some music and
[4:33:16] it become obnoxious to somebody else
[4:33:19] if it'll help you to keep the devil
[4:33:22] running
[4:33:23] then we encourage you to do it
[4:33:26] hallelujah father
[4:33:28] how our hearts
[4:33:30] are thankful today
[4:33:33] for your goodness and your grace
[4:33:36] your mercy that you give to us again and
[4:33:39] again and again
[4:33:42] thank you lord for the word of the lord
[4:33:45] to us today
[4:33:46] and god may we keep our eyes focused on
[4:33:51] you
[4:33:51] and know that when the enemy comes
[4:33:54] against us you have put a word in our
[4:33:58] mouth to send him packing
[4:34:01] we do have targets on us lord because we
[4:34:04] have been called and elected as part of
[4:34:07] the bride of jesus christ and we know
[4:34:11] that he's after us he's not going to
[4:34:13] quit but oh lord i just want to thank
[4:34:16] you for victory today

[4:34:24] may every person that is under the sound
[4:34:27] of our voice or may hear this recording
[4:34:30] may god there not be able to be one
[4:34:33] critical word come up out of their mouth
[4:34:36] but may they be caught up in the
[4:34:37] crescendo of the praises of the living
[4:34:41] god and see their own chains fall off in
[4:34:45] the name of jesus christ
[4:34:50] oh lord
