[37:38] my heart uh you read the book some of
[37:41] you Thrones of the soul and it kind of
[37:43] It kind of says the same thing there are
[37:46] more than one Kingdom ruling sometime in
[37:49] our life and we need to bring them all
[37:52] down and submit them to the Dominion and
[37:54] the authority of Jesus Christ you know
[37:57] sometimes the enemy will will use that
[37:59] part and we're wondering where did that
[38:01] come from where did that come from and
[38:04] it most likely came from a corner
[38:07] Kingdom something way back in the back
[38:09] of the inner man that hasn't been tore
[38:12] down and submitted to Jesus Christ may
[38:14] we find Grace today to submit all things
[38:18] to him so that there's nothing left
[38:21] there's no argumentative spirit in us
[38:23] there's no striving spirit in us we just
[38:26] walk walk in his rest he's God's
[38:28] Sovereign and he's God Supreme aren't

[48:41] Lord in prayer this morning there are
[48:43] many needs among us but God's got them
[48:46] all you can be seated since we're all
[48:47] doing something different let's do the
[48:50] same
[48:51] thing um we want to continue to pray for
[48:55] brother H Shepherd who is very sick he
[48:58] is still in the hospital they're talking
[49:01] about a blood transfusion his blood
[49:03] pressure is very low his pottassium
[49:06] levels are very low uh they've been
[49:09] giving him supplemental potassium but uh
[49:13] the the levels remain quite low they've
[49:15] come up just a little bit but uh that
[49:18] that means he's in in potential of
[49:21] having uh injury to his heart damage to
[49:24] his heart because of the low potass ium
[49:25] levels they don't know what's causing it
[49:28] there there is a there two blood clots
[49:31] at least and uh but both doctors have
[49:34] said we don't know we do not know what's
[49:36] wrong and so we want to just believe God
[49:39] for a miracle and yet uh and yet
[49:43] yesterday afternoon they were talking
[49:44] about letting him go home before all
[49:46] this begin to kind of come again so I I
[49:49] I don't think I'd want to be home at a
[49:51] time like this I think I'd want to know
[49:53] what's going on and uh uh we want to see
[49:56] a miracle for him we want God to talk to
[49:59] him in this this is not a wasted trial
[50:03] this is for a purpose and for a reason
[50:06] and let's pray that he will uh he will
[50:09] certainly uh put his trust in the Lord
[50:12] and not be afraid it's certainly an
[50:14] urgent uh urgent need we're so thankful
[50:17] for how God has been with sister EVN Fox
[50:20] this week she fell in her basement she
[50:23] broke her femur which I've been told is
[50:26] the most painful bone in the body to
[50:27] break it was just a it was just a a few
[50:31] uh inches I guess from her hip and uh so
[50:35] the pain was so
[50:37] excruciating um before the surgery that
[50:40] they used every pain medication they had
[50:43] and and nothing was touching the pain
[50:45] and it was really touch and go because
[50:48] of the pain you do understand that your
[50:51] systems can shut down because of that
[50:53] kind of extreme pain and there was a a
[50:56] an initial report that came from the
[50:58] family they weren't sure they they just
[51:00] weren't sure but God was with her and
[51:03] they uh she's gone through the surgery
[51:05] she actually called uh sister Alita
[51:09] yesterday and uh was doing so much
[51:11] better she has uh several weeks of rehab
[51:15] uh left she'll have to once she's
[51:17] recuperated they'll send her to rehab
[51:20] and she'll uh be going through that for
[51:22] a few weeks and that may not be easy but
[51:24] she feels like she can do it and I do
[51:26] too because her hope and trust is in the
[51:29] Lord so let's continue to pray for her
[51:32] and the family both sons are are working
[51:35] hard for her and um and her husband and
[51:38] we want to believe God to use this to
[51:40] draw every one of them closer to the
[51:43] Lord sister Claudia reached out and
[51:45] she's done made some kind of injury to
[51:47] her back and is in a lot of pain and
[51:50] asked to be remembered today that God

[1:07:31] him and next Saturday Jenna has a
[1:07:35] birthday and uh it's her last birthday
[1:07:38] expecting this
[1:07:40] baby so let's say happy birthday to her
[1:07:43] coming up this
[1:07:49] week he's good all the time amen I want
[1:07:53] to share something with with you before
[1:07:54] brother gy comes to bring the word today
[1:07:57] um we're excited about what the Lord is
[1:07:59] doing we uh spent some time together
[1:08:02] Down Under The
[1:08:04] Tabernacle uh and every time I say
[1:08:07] Tabernacle I can hear Steve Curry in the
[1:08:11] background who who uh you know would
[1:08:15] have if he would have been here with us
[1:08:16] this week he would have had an Earthly
[1:08:18] birthday I don't believe that there are
[1:08:20] birthdays celebrated in heaven because
[1:08:23] that's eternity and not time but uh he
[1:08:27] always called it especially the years
[1:08:29] that we uh had some food down there
[1:08:32] after Services there was a time that we
[1:08:34] did that as we had just come into this
[1:08:37] place and he would call it the
[1:08:41] Tabernacle and uh the first time I heard
[1:08:43] it I thought that that is disrespectful
[1:08:46] to call the Tabernacle
[1:08:49] tabernackle and then I remembered that
[1:08:52] God said everything that that we built
[1:08:54] on this ground would be
[1:08:59] multi-purpose so we're not changing the
[1:09:02] name henceforth it shall not be referred
[1:09:05] to officially as the
[1:09:08] tabernackle but if you Snicker every
[1:09:11] time I say Tabernacle I'll know why I
[1:09:14] almost can hear it like in his voice but
[1:09:17] anyway we were down at the
[1:09:20] Tabernacle uh this week and uh looking
[1:09:24] at the progress of what is already
[1:09:26] happened and uh all the old lights are
[1:09:29] gone and some new lights are put in and
[1:09:31] power is uh uh is down there again after
[1:09:35] so many years and uh there are plans for
[1:09:38] progress and I'll let brother gy tell
[1:09:40] you about that in just a little while
[1:09:42] but we had had a nice talk and and I ask
[1:09:45] dumb questions but I always get good
[1:09:48] answers I don't know the first thing
[1:09:50] about building anything or remodeling
[1:09:53] anything anything or so I do ask I
[1:09:56] realize that I do ask some pretty uh
[1:09:59] ignorant questions but brother gy is
[1:10:01] always patient and he just explains them
[1:10:03] to me like I like I know you know the
[1:10:06] details but when we when we come back up
[1:10:09] in the truck and I said goodbye to him
[1:10:12] and asked him would he Preach Today and
[1:10:14] and he agreed uh slightly reluctantly
[1:10:17] but he agreed and as as the door shut
[1:10:21] and I started down the hallway I had a
[1:10:25] very familiar feeling one that I haven't
[1:10:27] had in quite a while just a sensation
[1:10:30] we're not living by feeling we're not
[1:10:32] living by sensation we're actually
[1:10:34] living by
[1:10:36] vision and that was the feeling that I
[1:10:38] had as I walked down I just started
[1:10:40] weeping because I realized that I had
[1:10:43] that feeling again of walking in a
[1:10:45] vision and I realize that that the plans
[1:10:49] that we had just discussed are very much
[1:10:52] a part of our plan the plan for the
[1:10:55] future and uh we didn't know that it
[1:10:58] would take 30 years to get to this place
[1:11:02] in some ways it feels like 70 years but
[1:11:06] in other ways it feels like
[1:11:08] 10 time flies when you're in the battle
[1:11:13] you thought I was going to say when
[1:11:14] you're having fun time flies when you're
[1:11:17] in the battle and if you can have fun
[1:11:20] while you're in the battle you should
[1:11:23] many of you believe that there has been
[1:11:25] lots of joy in 30 years going into the
[1:11:28] 31st year there's been lots of Joy
[1:11:31] there's been lots of goodness there's
[1:11:32] been lots of faithfulness from God he's
[1:11:35] never failed us one time he's been
[1:11:38] faithful and we have had more it seems
[1:11:41] like in the natural more than our share
[1:11:43] of lessons but God knew exactly what it
[1:11:46] was going to take to teach us something
[1:11:48] now I don't know about you but there are
[1:11:50] times still that I feel that I don't
[1:11:52] know near what I have to to know but I
[1:11:54] know that the one who's taught me thus
[1:11:56] far he's faithful do you believe that so
[1:12:01] I don't want to take much time I do want
[1:12:03] the musicians to stay with me just a
[1:12:04] moment because we're going to welcome
[1:12:06] brother gley with a song I can do some
[1:12:09] more of this another time but I just
[1:12:11] wanted to put a few pieces of this out
[1:12:14] for you and uh I I thought I had it all
[1:12:17] in my mind what I was going to start
[1:12:19] with but uh let's just
[1:12:24] skip to
[1:12:28] um no skipping let's start at the
[1:12:30] beginning real quickly August of
[1:12:33] 1990 is is when we begin to gather uh in
[1:12:38] Columbus um God had done some amazing
[1:12:41] things and I'll remind you of those
[1:12:43] things at another time but almost
[1:12:46] immediately God began to move Among Us
[1:12:49] in gifts and signs and wonders there
[1:12:52] were prophecies and tongues and
[1:12:54] interpretations there were visions and
[1:12:57] dreams and the Lord was already talking
[1:13:00] to us by late
[1:13:03] 1991 uh which would have been about
[1:13:06] December November December of 1991 he
[1:13:09] was already talking to us about a piece
[1:13:11] of property that he was going to give us
[1:13:14] on March the 8th of
[1:13:17] 1992 the Holy Ghost spoke in the service
[1:13:21] and he said I will fulfill the Vision
[1:13:24] that I have given to my servant saeth
[1:13:26] the Lord and you will walk upon the land
[1:13:30] that I have given him thus sayeth the
[1:13:33] Lord now that was March 8th
[1:13:36] 1992 I looked at pieces of property
[1:13:39] after that I found some amazing
[1:13:42] properties some beautiful properties but
[1:13:45] none of them matched the vision because
[1:13:48] in the vision there was a uh a number of
[1:13:52] cedar trees and they were placed in a
[1:13:56] unique pattern so that I would be able
[1:13:59] to identify the land when I found it I
[1:14:03] had walked all over this place it was a
[1:14:05] mess the people who owned this place
[1:14:08] before us had lost their marriage and
[1:14:11] they had uh agreed to sell this piece of
[1:14:14] property and before they did they wanted
[1:14:17] to get as much money out of it as they
[1:14:19] possibly could so they took the hardwood
[1:14:21] off and with those big skitters and all
[1:14:24] the kinds of equipment that they used
[1:14:26] there were ruts on this land so deep
[1:14:30] that I could stand in them and you
[1:14:31] couldn't see my head and uh in the
[1:14:34] natural it looked like junk it looked
[1:14:36] like junk land but you know God had a
[1:14:39] purpose and I got down at the bottom of
[1:14:42] the hill so it would be where the prayer
[1:14:44] Chapel sit and the pad is out there if
[1:14:46] you went down that slope is where I
[1:14:49] ended up being and I came up the hill
[1:14:52] behind the tabern Tabernacle and as I
[1:14:54] came up the hill I looked down and my
[1:14:56] shoe was untied and I propped my foot up
[1:15:00] on a fallen tree and to tie my shoe and
[1:15:04] when I did I looked up and there was the
[1:15:08] figuration of the cedar trees that I had
[1:15:11] seen in the vision I started weeping and
[1:15:13] I said this is it this is the property
[1:15:17] and uh so uh that took place on July the
[1:15:21] 28th of 19
[1:15:23] 1992 so remember we only came to
[1:15:27] Columbus in August of
[1:15:30] 1990 this is uh this is July the 28th of
[1:15:34] 92 two years
[1:15:36] later um and uh let me see the property
[1:15:40] was identified by vision and excuse me
[1:15:44] that that day was not July 28th July the
[1:15:47] 28th is the day the loan was approved to
[1:15:50] purchase the property and and on
[1:15:52] September the 4th 4th we closed the loan
[1:15:55] September the 4th 1992 and for those of
[1:15:58] you who want to know what we paid for
[1:16:00] the original property it was junk
[1:16:02] property we paid
[1:16:11] $55,200 the Lord spoke to us that the
[1:16:13] campground would be a refuge for Eagles
[1:16:17] the sick and wounded Eagles would find a
[1:16:19] place to be cared for to be revived and
[1:16:22] refilled
[1:16:23] and that from this place he would
[1:16:25] establish a final stirring for his bride
[1:16:29] it would be a turning point March the
[1:16:31] 6th of 93 he said I say unto thee
[1:16:35] greater things are up the road for the
[1:16:37] resurrection lays off just over the
[1:16:40] horizon saith the Lord but there's quite
[1:16:42] a hill to climb before you reach it I
[1:16:46] want to say Amen but I'm going to give
[1:16:49] you power and strength to climb over
[1:16:52] yeah I the Lord thy God would say unto
[1:16:54] thee I have spoken unto thee this place
[1:16:56] will be a filling station for people to
[1:16:59] come and be filled and some go away and
[1:17:03] do a work for me so on March the 1st
[1:17:07] 1993 we broke ground and Sanctified this
[1:17:11] piece of property for the Lord's work
[1:17:13] the Lord spoke to us multiple times with
[1:17:15] tongues interpretation and prophecy
[1:17:18] confirming over and over that we were
[1:17:20] walking in the vision and that he would
[1:17:22] give the Word of Deliverance that would
[1:17:24] set people free he also told us that we
[1:17:27] must step forward and claim his promises
[1:17:29] for this place and if we did not that
[1:17:32] they would lay unclaimed and go
[1:17:36] unpossessed that's a pretty serious word
[1:17:39] isn't it December the 27th of 1992 he
[1:17:43] spoke and said by Vision I showed it by
[1:17:47] prophecy I confirmed it by the power of
[1:17:51] my spirit I brought it to pass sayeth
[1:17:54] the Lord I will visit my people there
[1:17:58] because we were still there and he was
[1:18:01] referring to here December 27th same day
[1:18:05] he said I've chosen it saith the Lord as
[1:18:07] a place of Refuge yeah I say unto thee
[1:18:10] men and women will come from the East
[1:18:12] and the west north and south to that
[1:18:14] place and be renewed by my spirit and
[1:18:17] delivered of all manner of evil spirits
[1:18:20] the sick will be healed and I will use
[1:18:22] that place as an encouragement to the
[1:18:25] bride he has already he has already and
[1:18:29] he is and he will I believe that with
[1:18:33] all my heart if I had time I would read
[1:18:37] them all but I'll do that very soon I'll
[1:18:39] get them to you we truly believe that
[1:18:43] the paying off of this property was a
[1:18:45] miracle a supernatural miracle and it
[1:18:49] looked impossible absolutely impossible
[1:18:52] but but with God it has been possible
[1:18:56] and it has given us all the faith we
[1:18:58] need that every
[1:19:00] part uh one of the things that I
[1:19:03] mentioned in a service recently was uh
[1:19:06] when you see a vision when you see
[1:19:08] something in the spirit you often see
[1:19:10] things as they are at that at that
[1:19:13] moment or uh as technology would would
[1:19:17] be in that moment and we can give you
[1:19:19] scriptures in the Old Testament where
[1:19:21] there are prophecies given that have
[1:19:23] already come to pass in our day and some
[1:19:25] of them would have to do with weaponry
[1:19:28] and uh the ability to to drop missiles
[1:19:32] and bombs and things like that but
[1:19:33] remember the prophets of old they didn't
[1:19:35] know what airplanes were and so they
[1:19:39] described them the best way that they
[1:19:40] could well I'm not comparing any of us
[1:19:43] to the prophets of old but we had a
[1:19:46] vision that there would be printing
[1:19:47] presses and that the word of God would
[1:19:50] go out from this place in printed form
[1:19:53] now I believe that Vision I believe it
[1:19:56] will yet come to pass it is coming to
[1:19:58] pass already right now we have a website
[1:20:02] that people are reading uh from and
[1:20:05] feasting on every day of the week but I
[1:20:07] think it must be more than that but I
[1:20:10] don't believe it will be fulfilled by a
[1:20:12] room full of printing
[1:20:14] presses um I believe that at the time
[1:20:17] that's how the word would have been
[1:20:18] printed but we are 30 years are
[1:20:21] published we are 30 years on the other
[1:20:23] side of that so it may not look exactly
[1:20:27] like we thought but the same spirit of
[1:20:30] God who gave us the vision will help us
[1:20:32] to know when we are walking in the
[1:20:34] vision and I'm telling you today in the
[1:20:37] name of the Lord that what we are
[1:20:40] proposing for the for the Tabernacle is
[1:20:43] walking in a vision it is a purpose and
[1:20:47] you may you may think that that you are
[1:20:50] in our final Sanctuary but
[1:20:53] I don't know I don't know how I don't
[1:20:56] even know why because we haven't filled
[1:20:59] this one up yet but there is one to come
[1:21:03] and it is not at the Tabernacle it never
[1:21:06] was I don't know how uh you know that
[1:21:09] kind of became a thought among us but it
[1:21:12] never was to be there but we have a big
[1:21:15] problem where it is to be there are a
[1:21:18] couple families
[1:21:21] living and we're not kicking anybody off
[1:21:24] until we absolutely have to amen uh
[1:21:29] somebody said you know wait a minute we
[1:21:31] we we don't need that's right not now
[1:21:33] not right now we don't but in the
[1:21:38] time you believe I believe with all my
[1:21:41] heart let's stand to get ready to hear
[1:21:44] what the lord has laid on brother G's
[1:21:45] heart for this morning he will talk to
[1:21:48] us about what's going on and he will uh
[1:21:51] preach God's word to us and we will be
[1:21:54] blessed today is the 10th anniversary of
[1:21:58] the death of sister Anna
[1:22:00] Jones and uh sister Jones was a precious
[1:22:04] friend of mine and of this ministry and
[1:22:08] uh she loved us and uh just to be frank
[1:22:12] she loved
[1:22:14] me and where I
[1:22:17] was she wanted to be so I was not
[1:22:21] surprised when I I look up in Germany
[1:22:24] getting off the airplane and she's there
[1:22:27] and I wasn't surprised when I walked off
[1:22:30] the airplane in London and she was there
[1:22:33] and I wasn't surprised when I walked off
[1:22:35] the plane in the Netherlands and she was
[1:22:38] there because if she could get to where
[1:22:40] I was going to be she wanted to be there
[1:22:42] she even lived on this Campground for
[1:22:45] for a portion of time she was
[1:22:48] Dutch uh and she was not always EAS easy
[1:22:52] to uh to navigate
[1:22:55] with she had lived alone a long time and
[1:22:59] she was an amazing
[1:23:01] seamstress she made amazing muffins she
[1:23:05] taught me how to eat the tops of the
[1:23:07] beets and not just the bottom of the
[1:23:09] beats and she believed in the in the
[1:23:12] ministry that God placed here and she
[1:23:15] believed in the vision and God used her
[1:23:18] in Mighty ways when we came and broke
[1:23:20] ground on this property it was it was
[1:23:23] she that God used in a profound way to
[1:23:26] speak of the future I'm sad in some ways
[1:23:30] that she's not here to see what is
[1:23:32] already happened and the Fulfillment of
[1:23:34] what is to come but I think that she has
[1:23:37] a grander view and a more precious seat
[1:23:40] where there's lots of peace that she can
[1:23:43] look down and see us so before brother
[1:23:45] gy comes or as he's coming I want to
[1:23:47] sing her song this morning not fire fire
[1:23:51] fire anybody remember that fire fire
[1:23:56] fire I I want to sing something I can
[1:23:58] get when he was on the cross I was on
[1:24:01] his mind let's sing just a little bit of
[1:24:04] that as we prepare our hearts to hear
[1:24:05] the word amen

[1:28:52] for every person that God ever sent here
[1:28:55] I did not get here with my family until
[1:28:58] 1996 although we visited the first time
[1:29:02] on our anniversary in March of
[1:29:06] 1993 so uh and and I've known brother
[1:29:09] Shelly
[1:29:10] since the beginning of
[1:29:13] 1989 so I would say that I've known him
[1:29:16] longer than any of you that are sitting
[1:29:18] here um but did not come to this church
[1:29:21] and until we moved here in the spring of
[1:29:26] 1996 so it's been a long journey I
[1:29:30] didn't think when I came that I would
[1:29:32] still uh be pressing along like this
[1:29:35] after 27 years we thought the Rapture
[1:29:38] was going to take place we thought we
[1:29:40] were going to be out of here uh we
[1:29:43] thought that the vision was going to be
[1:29:45] all accomplished and that we would be
[1:29:47] gone but here we are in
[1:29:49] 2024 still pressing on
[1:29:52] I'm glad there's something inside of me
[1:29:54] that still wants to press
[1:29:57] on so I started putting some thoughts
[1:30:01] together uh I'm going to show you a
[1:30:04] video before I preach but three years
[1:30:06] ago in this very same season yes I was
[1:30:11] looking at the Tabernacle yes and
[1:30:14] lamenting where are the wagon
[1:30:17] loads where is the Fulfillment of your
[1:30:21] promise for this property yes he spoke
[1:30:24] into my inner man and said until a
[1:30:27] concentrated effort is made to get rid
[1:30:29] of the debt on the property the wagon
[1:30:31] loads are not coming yes on February the
[1:30:35] 7th of 2021 I preached a message
[1:30:37] building God a house from the book of
[1:30:41] hegi spent a lot of time laying out
[1:30:43] timeline details and intersections with
[1:30:46] heah Zechariah as well as the Rabel and
[1:30:50] the high priest Joshua and what what
[1:30:53] parts they played and it seemed like a
[1:30:55] lot of history and what does that have
[1:30:57] to do with
[1:30:59] us after the service as brother Shelly
[1:31:02] we were in the foyer we were shaking
[1:31:05] hands and brother Shelly came out there
[1:31:07] and he was shaking hands and he said to
[1:31:08] me if you have something to say say it
[1:31:11] if you've got a rebuke rebuke us say
[1:31:15] it and so I said I've got something to
[1:31:18] say but I want to talk to you first yes
[1:31:21] he's the highest Authority in the house
[1:31:24] I don't say that because that I'm
[1:31:27] humbling myself I say that because I
[1:31:29] know it he's the highest Authority in
[1:31:32] the house and so I came and I told him
[1:31:35] what I had in mind but I wanted to to
[1:31:39] discuss it with
[1:31:40] him he we found time that week to
[1:31:44] discuss it and of of what the Lord was
[1:31:48] dealing with me about and on March the
[1:31:50] 7th of 2021 I came and I preached part
[1:31:54] two of making God a house or building
[1:31:57] God a house it's a very odd time because
[1:32:02] it happened to be the Sunday that sister
[1:32:04] Flo had invited Sheriff that's right
[1:32:07] James Woodruff and a whole host of
[1:32:10] people from Troop County Georgia and I
[1:32:13] thought oh my goodness how am I going to
[1:32:16] deliver the
[1:32:17] word nevertheless there was a tremendous
[1:32:21] off offering that was given that Sunday
[1:32:23] to kick off ridding us of the debt sir
[1:32:27] we continued our first Sunday giving
[1:32:30] until November of
[1:32:32] 2023 when the last dollar was paid and
[1:32:35] we became mortgage
[1:32:37] free as 2023 closed out my work became
[1:32:42] very slow to the point that Joshua River
[1:32:45] had to take on another job it left me
[1:32:48] with free time which seems to bring me
[1:32:50] to the Eagles Refuge Refuge I don't even
[1:32:53] remember what day or why that I was
[1:32:56] under the Tabernacle when the idea hit
[1:32:59] me why are we paying rent on a place to
[1:33:03] Fellowship when we have an unused
[1:33:06] building my initial thought was get some
[1:33:10] power put up some plastic walls and
[1:33:14] bring out some tables and chairs and
[1:33:16] we'll have a place to
[1:33:19] Fellowship so I present presented the
[1:33:22] idea to brother Shelly and I defer to
[1:33:25] him because the Visions were given to
[1:33:28] him not to me I didn't see the Visions
[1:33:31] I've tried to help to propel them
[1:33:33] forward with what I
[1:33:35] understood but I didn't see the vision
[1:33:38] so I wanted to know is this something
[1:33:41] that is feasible and within the
[1:33:43] parameters of the
[1:33:45] Visions so we discussed it at length and
[1:33:49] we prayed sincerely and during the
[1:33:51] prayer
[1:33:52] time uh my initial vision and thoughts
[1:33:56] were enlarged some by talking and some
[1:34:00] by
[1:34:01] praying what would it hurt to have a
[1:34:04] concrete floor anything we do a concrete
[1:34:07] floor would be beneficial it'd be great
[1:34:11] I thought about constructing bathrooms
[1:34:13] outside of the Tabernacle footprint but
[1:34:15] later
[1:34:16] rethought with the input from Brother
[1:34:19] Shelly and others we brought the
[1:34:20] bathrooms back back under the Tabernacle
[1:34:22] structure in my drawing then we talked
[1:34:25] about a future
[1:34:27] kitchen the plan is to take 1/3 of the
[1:34:32] Tabernacle the Tabernacle is 75 by 150
[1:34:36] ft So the plan is to take onethird of
[1:34:40] the Tabernacle which is
[1:34:43] 3,750 ft square
[1:34:46] feet give you a try to give you a vision
[1:34:49] of of how big that is all of us have set
[1:34:54] out here in the summer Under the Tent
[1:34:58] which is 40t by 60 ft which happens to
[1:35:02] be 2400 Square ft
[1:35:05] that 50 by 75 gives us an additional
[1:35:11] 1350 Square
[1:35:13] ft minusing out the bathroom footprint
[1:35:16] of 390 squ ft that gives us
[1:35:20] 3,3 60 square ft which is approximately
[1:35:24] 900 square ft larger than the
[1:35:27] tent for your visual for your visual
[1:35:33] visualization from front to back of the
[1:35:36] Tabernacle 12T
[1:35:39] wide is 900 square
[1:35:43] ft 12 by 75 extra feet I believe that it
[1:35:49] will serve us well
[1:35:52] now for
[1:35:53] now everything that we do is with
[1:35:56] intention of progressing as the Lord
[1:35:59] leads
[1:36:02] us the first thing that we had to do was
[1:36:05] to get power back down
[1:36:07] there I've already told you I
[1:36:10] went and I got a permit to get the
[1:36:14] poll and when they asked me a certain
[1:36:16] question I did not give them the whole
[1:36:19] truth caused me to repent and go back
[1:36:23] and buy a second
[1:36:25] permit so that the power underneath of
[1:36:28] the Tabernacle at this point now has
[1:36:32] been upgraded to within the code of Lee
[1:36:37] County Alabama it has been approved by
[1:36:39] the Lee County building inspections
[1:36:41] department and we have been finalized
[1:36:44] and been given uh that certificate till
[1:36:47] that now that is all behind us there are
[1:36:50] new lights new breaker boxes new
[1:36:52] underground power that is all there and
[1:36:55] it is
[1:36:56] completed next thing that was to take
[1:36:59] place was to ensure that the roof was
[1:37:02] repaired to stop the
[1:37:04] leaks I put out the word to our brothers
[1:37:08] from Indiana as well as brother Truman
[1:37:10] and brother Austin Hollowell and uh I
[1:37:14] made it in such a way till that it
[1:37:16] provoked them to come to our fellowship
[1:37:18] meeting and our brothers that could also
[1:37:21] helped us for several hours on the
[1:37:24] Saturday of our fellowship meeting
[1:37:27] passed and we removed nearly
[1:37:31] 5,000 screws out of the roof of that
[1:37:35] building
[1:37:37] oh after the screws were
[1:37:40] removed we took a wire brush and wire
[1:37:44] brushed where the screw had been because
[1:37:46] many of the screws when they were driven
[1:37:48] the the those of you that know anything
[1:37:50] about a metal roof there's a rubber
[1:37:53] washer that becomes
[1:37:55] disintegrated and then the metal that's
[1:37:57] on top was starting to rust the roof and
[1:38:02] over the years water had caused rust
[1:38:05] spots and in some place had eaten the
[1:38:07] metal away so we wire brushed those
[1:38:11] Rusty spots we took a specialized caul
[1:38:14] and put it on that spot that had uh been
[1:38:17] Rusty and a new screw was put back in
[1:38:20] its place
[1:38:22] the majority of that was done on that
[1:38:24] Saturday we ran out of screws my
[1:38:27] calculation was wrong but that project
[1:38:29] is complete and behind us while this was
[1:38:33] being done on the ground in the dirt
[1:38:36] Joshua Yantis and brother Truman Miller
[1:38:38] were working on the dirt to keep water
[1:38:41] from running under the Tabernacle for
[1:38:44] many years from sediment and water
[1:38:46] running water the dirt had built up and
[1:38:49] water was running under the Tabernacle
[1:38:52] every time it
[1:38:53] rained I am so happy because Monday or
[1:38:57] Tuesday rather just before church time I
[1:39:00] walked down because I wanted to
[1:39:02] know did it
[1:39:04] work after the rain that came last
[1:39:08] weekend and it was
[1:39:10] [Music]
[1:39:11] [Applause]
[1:39:19] dry let's show you the video that we
[1:39:21] have prepared if you'll pull the lights
[1:39:24] down this is from the work that we was
[1:39:27] done on that
[1:39:28] Saturday just a short video that brother
[1:39:32] Hawke so graciously put together for
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:50] us
[1:39:56] [Music]
[1:40:11] [Applause]
[1:40:13] [Music]
[1:40:20] than
[1:40:25] [Music]
[1:40:32] [Music]
[1:41:35] [Music]
[1:41:59] [Applause]
[1:42:07] [Music]
[1:42:11] [Applause]
[1:42:17] again our plan is to take one-third the
[1:42:20] right hand if you were looking at the
[1:42:23] Tabernacle you'll if you have ever paid
[1:42:26] attention to it the right third is open
[1:42:29] the middle third is got metal siding the
[1:42:34] left third is
[1:42:35] open the plan is to take the right
[1:42:40] third to close in the right hand wall to
[1:42:44] close in the front wall and then the
[1:42:48] left side of it would be with uh we
[1:42:51] would stud it up and either put uh heavy
[1:42:54] plastic or an insulating foam board on
[1:42:57] those studs to close in that side
[1:43:00] because it's temporary it's only
[1:43:02] temporary and so that is our plan uh for
[1:43:07] now and so uh the next step after what
[1:43:11] has already been done of course is to
[1:43:14] get the Ruffin plumbing done you want to
[1:43:17] throw that picture up
[1:43:19] there
[1:43:24] the next
[1:43:26] one the Ruffin plumbing is nearly done
[1:43:30] that when I it was not wow so the rough
[1:43:34] end Plumbing is nearing completion
[1:43:36] hopefully this week we're going to get
[1:43:38] this water supply line back down there
[1:43:40] because that plumbing has to be tested
[1:43:42] with water and I really don't want to
[1:43:43] carry buckets down
[1:43:45] there nor do I want to run 500 feet of
[1:43:49] water hose maybe more so that will cost
[1:43:54] I'm I'm just going to throw some numbers
[1:43:55] out so you know that this is going to
[1:43:57] take some time it's going to take some
[1:44:00] money uh it the rough in plumbing will
[1:44:02] cost about
[1:44:03] $1,400 then a ter after that is done
[1:44:06] then there will be uh of course
[1:44:08] groundwork under the Tabernacle because
[1:44:11] everything has to be set to 4 in for the
[1:44:15] pouring of the concrete so uh I didn't
[1:44:17] even put that number in here because I
[1:44:19] don't know it will require some gravels
[1:44:22] perhaps maybe just some moving around of
[1:44:25] gravels I don't know then a a termite
[1:44:27] pre-treat uh was going to cost about
[1:44:30] $500 and then my initial uh cost for
[1:44:35] concrete on the floor is
[1:44:38] $116,000 uh the spray foam in the
[1:44:40] ceiling so that we are not being baked
[1:44:43] all the time would be about
[1:44:45] $10,000 then the framing 5,000 metal
[1:44:48] siding 6,000 then the windows and the
[1:44:51] doors I'm still waiting for the quote
[1:44:53] wall insulation
[1:44:55] $3,200 and this does not include air
[1:44:58] conditioning bathroom fixtures sheetrock
[1:45:00] etc etc etc we'll continue as the Lord
[1:45:04] provides and as he uses his people one
[1:45:07] thing we do know God got us out of debt
[1:45:10] we don't want to go back into
[1:45:14] debt what
[1:45:19] that call that
[1:45:28] out all right
[1:45:34] 14400 1400
[1:45:36] 500
[1:45:39] 16,000
[1:45:41] 10,000
[1:45:43] 5,000
[1:45:45] 6,000
[1:45:49] 3,200
[1:45:56] excellent
[1:45:59] so it is my
[1:46:03] opinion
[1:46:04] that we need to start
[1:46:07] mentioning more
[1:46:09] frequently once
[1:46:11] again about receiving a first Sunday
[1:46:17] offering um you all have been so
[1:46:21] faithful to do
[1:46:23] that uh what God did was
[1:46:28] Supernatural it was above the natural it
[1:46:31] was
[1:46:32] not uh of the natural God did it three
[1:46:36] years ago nearly half a million dollars
[1:46:39] in debt and in less than three years God
[1:46:43] took care of that debt he used people
[1:46:45] yes of course he used people he always
[1:46:48] does and I'm thankful for the
[1:46:51] faithfulness of God's people those of
[1:46:53] you that sit here in this sanctuary and
[1:46:56] those that are out over the camera that
[1:46:58] are a part of this ministry people that
[1:47:01] uh have never been here that wanted to
[1:47:04] be a part and and I just say that uh
[1:47:08] we've I've already had another church to
[1:47:10] contact me this week and they want to
[1:47:12] send an offering for
[1:47:15] the praise the
[1:47:17] [Music]
[1:47:19] Lord
[1:47:21] [Music]
[1:47:23] and we have a plan we have some initial
[1:47:26] plans for the rest of the Tabernacle
[1:47:29] it's too too to talk about now but oh
[1:47:32] why
[1:47:34] [Music]
[1:47:35] unbelievable it's not going to none of
[1:47:37] the space will be wasted and hopefully
[1:47:40] at some point we can open up differentes
[1:47:43] and still have let me just throw a
[1:47:46] little tidbit out sure just throw a
[1:47:49] little tidbit out
[1:47:51] part of the Talk Is Lifting the
[1:47:55] roof wonder
[1:47:57] why and I asked brother Dwayne Jackson
[1:48:00] while he was here because his family
[1:48:04] owns a company that deals with steel
[1:48:07] structure and I asked I've asked Nathan
[1:48:10] because Nathan has some familiarity with
[1:48:13] the metal in welding and I asked brother
[1:48:15] Dwayne I said could a section be welded
[1:48:19] on top of these beams and he said what I
[1:48:22] would do would be to remove them lift it
[1:48:24] up and build concrete pillars underneath
[1:48:27] of them that seems
[1:48:31] monstrous
[1:48:33] but you talk to the right
[1:48:36] people you talk to the right people and
[1:48:40] they start throwing ideas at you and all
[1:48:43] of the sudden you realize this is more
[1:48:45] doable than you thought it
[1:48:48] was gymnasium
[1:48:51] and so we're going to start out with a
[1:48:55] place to eat have
[1:48:58] Fellowship that's more important
[1:49:03] volleyball but we are going to have a
[1:49:07] place on The Refuge amen where that we
[1:49:11] can gather together and be together and
[1:49:15] have Fellowship one with
[1:49:17] another fellowship is important
[1:49:21] it's important for us to Fellowship
[1:49:24] together God called us together not just
[1:49:27] to come into the sanctuary and worship
[1:49:31] together but he called us as a body to
[1:49:34] worship together you ever wonder why
[1:49:37] that you were called here instead of
[1:49:39] somewhere up the
[1:49:40] road why that I I was pondering I was
[1:49:45] pondering this week about a a couple
[1:49:47] that goes to my dad's church they they
[1:49:50] don't seem to live the standard that he
[1:49:53] preaches and and they
[1:49:57] they've I I I've just wondered why don't
[1:49:59] you go to the Baptist Church up the
[1:50:03] road I I mean it seems to be more in
[1:50:05] line with with what you seem to care
[1:50:09] about so why are you
[1:50:13] here it was just a thought of
[1:50:16] mine but somehow God puts people in
[1:50:20] certain
[1:50:21] places sometimes for great lengths of
[1:50:23] time sometimes for small amounts of time
[1:50:25] and it's all for a purpose right
[1:50:28] whatever that is I don't have to figure
[1:50:31] it out but I'm glad that God knows all
[1:50:34] about it would you stand with us as we
[1:50:36] look to the word
[1:50:38] today thank you all so very
[1:50:49] much
[1:50:52] is there anybody here that's ready to
[1:50:54] help us get
[1:50:56] started I mean it's already started but
[1:50:59] we're just excited that it's moving
[1:51:01] forward and that God is helping us to to
[1:51:06] have the vision the the understanding to
[1:51:09] be able to move forward with it and it's
[1:51:13] it's not always easy but we want to be
[1:51:15] obedient in what God tells us to
[1:51:17] do John 2:
[1:51:26] 13 here I am
[1:51:29] again I find it very
[1:51:32] [Music]
[1:51:34] odd
[1:51:36] that in this season three years ago I
[1:51:40] came here and preached a sermon
[1:51:43] called building God a
[1:51:45] house and I was led to this passage of
[1:51:50] scripture last week and felt that I was
[1:51:54] to share it here this week and it has to
[1:51:57] do with the house
[1:51:59] again verse 13 and the Jews Passover was
[1:52:04] at hand and Jesus went up to
[1:52:07] Jerusalem and found in the temple those
[1:52:09] that sold oxen and sheep and doves and
[1:52:12] the Changers of money sitting and when
[1:52:16] he had made a scourge of small cords he
[1:52:18] drove them all out of the temple and the
[1:52:21] sheep and The Oxen and poured out the
[1:52:24] Changers money and overthrew the tables
[1:52:28] and said unto them that sold doves take
[1:52:31] these things hence make not my father's
[1:52:34] house and House of
[1:52:37] merchandise and his disciples remembered
[1:52:40] that it was written the Zeal of thine
[1:52:43] house ha eaten me
[1:52:46] up then said the
[1:52:48] Jews
[1:52:51] back up Verse 18 then answered the Jews
[1:52:53] and said unto himwhat sign showest
[1:52:58] us what sign showest thou unto us seeing
[1:53:03] thou doest these things Jesus answered
[1:53:06] and said unto them destroy this Temple
[1:53:10] and in three days I will raise it up
[1:53:14] then said the Jews 4 and6 years was this
[1:53:18] temple in building and will thou rear it
[1:53:20] up in 3 days but he spoke of the Temple
[1:53:25] of his body when therefore he was risen
[1:53:28] from the dead his disciples remembered
[1:53:30] that he had said this unto them and they
[1:53:33] believed the scripture and the word
[1:53:35] which Jesus had said let's pray before
[1:53:39] you're seated our father thank you Lord
[1:53:42] I want to thank you for your
[1:53:43] faithfulness yes I want to thank you
[1:53:46] that you have sustained us this week yes
[1:53:50] you have sustained us our lifetime Lord
[1:53:52] and we're grateful it's not always been
[1:53:55] easy but we want to thank you that your
[1:53:58] grace is sufficient now Lord as we
[1:54:01] approach your word I pray that you will
[1:54:03] settle us that you will give us Grace to
[1:54:06] get in the channel I pray Lord that you
[1:54:08] would help your servant to yield myself
[1:54:11] to you that you can speak to us and Lord
[1:54:14] that you will say exactly what you want
[1:54:17] to say nothing more nothing
[1:54:20] less get honor and Glory we pray for it
[1:54:24] is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:54:26] that we pray amen amen you may have your
[1:54:30] seats
[1:54:39] God you find a very similar telling of
[1:54:44] this story in Matthew CH
[1:54:48] 21: 12 12-1
[1:54:51] 17 Mark
[1:54:54] 11:
[1:54:56] 15-19 and also Luke 19:
[1:55:03] 45-48 people that are smarter than
[1:55:07] I have stated that these are two
[1:55:10] separate
[1:55:11] occasions Matthew Mark and Luke are at
[1:55:14] the end of Jesus's
[1:55:16] Ministry the one that we read in John at
[1:55:19] the beginning of Jesus's Ministry I
[1:55:22] don't
[1:55:25] know it appears that way in the sequence
[1:55:28] of events that are
[1:55:30] told but when we look at John's account
[1:55:35] which appears to be at the beginning of
[1:55:37] Jesus's
[1:55:38] Ministry we see that as he came into the
[1:55:42] temple all of the instances were at
[1:55:45] Passover
[1:55:48] time John's account it states that they
[1:55:52] there were those that sold oxen sheep
[1:55:55] and
[1:55:56] doves and there were money changers that
[1:56:00] were sitting there and that
[1:56:05] Jesus was upset with what he was seeing
[1:56:09] and the Bible says that he made a
[1:56:11] scourge of small
[1:56:14] cords now no doubt there were pieces of
[1:56:19] rope laying
[1:56:22] around Jesus perhaps had some in his
[1:56:25] pocket I don't know but the Bible does
[1:56:27] say he made the
[1:56:31] scourge do you know how long it takes to
[1:56:33] make a
[1:56:35] whip I don't know how long it took
[1:56:38] Jesus but I was provoked to Google
[1:56:43] it and there's a man that makes
[1:56:46] professional bull
[1:56:48] whips
[1:56:50] and he said that it takes him 6 to8
[1:56:53] hours to make a 12 plat bull whip 6 feet
[1:56:59] long I don't know how big Jesus's
[1:57:02] Scourge was his whip I don't know
[1:57:05] whether he was sitting there and and and
[1:57:09] platting this thing for some time or
[1:57:12] whether it happened very quickly I don't
[1:57:14] know it doesn't really matter but it's
[1:57:17] it does say that he made the
[1:57:21] whip it does not say that he hit
[1:57:29] anybody now I want you to think about
[1:57:33] the supernatural Miracle of this
[1:57:38] event Josephus estimated estimates that
[1:57:42] up to two and a quarter million people
[1:57:45] visited Jerusalem during the Passover
[1:57:48] time which would generate the equivalent
[1:57:51] of hundreds of millions of dollars and
[1:57:54] that the money changers open their
[1:57:56] stalls in the country towns a month
[1:57:59] before the feast and then move them to
[1:58:01] the temple by the time of the first
[1:58:03] arrivals now can you imagine as Jesus
[1:58:07] walks into the uh most likely the porch
[1:58:12] of the Gentiles as he walks in and he
[1:58:15] sees all these people but he sees the
[1:58:17] merchandising that is going on and it
[1:58:20] upsets him and he makes this Whip and
[1:58:23] then it says that he drove out all of
[1:58:26] the
[1:58:28] people now even if it was 50,000
[1:58:33] people against one man it was
[1:58:36] Supernatural but if what Josephus says
[1:58:39] that there was two and A4 million people
[1:58:42] that had descended upon the holy city
[1:58:45] for the time of Passover what a miracle
[1:58:48] indeed it was was that Jesus was able to
[1:58:51] Plat this Whip and that he was able to
[1:58:54] drive them out whether he flipped the
[1:58:57] Whip or whether he just held it in the
[1:58:59] air or whether he indeed hit anybody I
[1:59:01] have no
[1:59:03] idea Bible doesn't State all of those
[1:59:06] details but they all
[1:59:09] left the Bible says all of them
[1:59:14] yes and he drove out those that sold the
[1:59:17] oxen the Sheep the doves and the
[1:59:20] Changers of money now why would there
[1:59:23] have to be Changers of money there at
[1:59:26] the temple and you've got to understand
[1:59:29] that there were people from every nation
[1:59:31] that came there or from many nations
[1:59:33] that came there to celebrate the
[1:59:36] Passover and they probably carried big
[1:59:39] bills and they wanted to make smaller
[1:59:41] bills and also they needed the currency
[1:59:44] that was used in the Temple and so there
[1:59:47] was this money exchange that was was
[1:59:49] going on but as Jesus is is watching all
[1:59:53] of this happen and he realizes the
[1:59:56] merchandising that is going on now we
[1:59:59] also understand that there were people
[2:00:03] that came to Jerusalem that were looking
[2:00:07] to buy an animal because the sacrifice
[2:00:10] was necessary that's
[2:00:13] right was this God's provided way we
[2:00:17] don't need to argue about
[2:00:21] that but over time there were men that
[2:00:24] had devious
[2:00:26] ideas and they found ways because that
[2:00:31] it always seems that when money gets
[2:00:33] involved politics gets
[2:00:36] involved and as the money and politics
[2:00:39] began to intertwine there were men who
[2:00:43] were not born again who were a part of
[2:00:46] those around the temple who saw it as a
[2:00:48] way to make money and then there was a a
[2:00:53] joint effort with these money changers
[2:00:57] and probably the priesthood where that
[2:01:00] the priesthood would be found denying a
[2:01:03] certain animal and said that one's not
[2:01:05] good enough you'll have to go out those
[2:01:07] that are by that are selling them and
[2:01:09] you'll have to get one that is of the
[2:01:11] right quality that's right so that
[2:01:16] intermingling of of of money andl
[2:01:19] politics and corrupt men had had seeped
[2:01:22] into the Tabernacle to the point where
[2:01:25] people thought what's the use of me
[2:01:27] dragging this animal all the way from my
[2:01:30] home in the north all the way to
[2:01:32] Jerusalem only for the priest to say
[2:01:34] it's not good
[2:01:36] enough so it led to the money changers
[2:01:40] and those that sold doves and and oxen
[2:01:43] and sheep it came till that that process
[2:01:47] became larger and larger and larger over
[2:01:50] time and the corruption creeped in
[2:01:53] bigger and bigger and bigger until that
[2:01:56] it was such a Ruckus that people had
[2:02:00] lost their sincerity of worship and they
[2:02:04] were the the The
[2:02:06] Outsiders no doubt really had a heart to
[2:02:09] worship right but those that were buy
[2:02:13] that that were selling them and telling
[2:02:15] you that your sacrifice is not good
[2:02:17] enough
[2:02:20] in connection with the priesthood who
[2:02:23] had become corrupt then you say the the
[2:02:27] priesthood was corrupt well just think
[2:02:31] that shortly after this
[2:02:33] incident the priesthood are the ones who
[2:02:37] were riled up against Jesus of Nazareth
[2:02:40] and had him crucified that's right now
[2:02:43] we know that all of this was the plan of
[2:02:46] God yes but all all of this priesthood
[2:02:51] were conniving to have Jesus put away
[2:02:54] because of the trouble he stirred up in
[2:02:57] the temple compound the trouble that he
[2:03:00] stirred up there when he would come in
[2:03:03] this being one of the first times that
[2:03:05] he comes in and he says that you have
[2:03:08] made my house a house of merchandise
[2:03:12] take these things away you've made my
[2:03:15] house a house of merchandise and so uh
[2:03:19] we we look back in some of these other
[2:03:21] accounts and in Matthew's account Jesus
[2:03:25] cast out those that bought and sold he
[2:03:27] overthrew the money changer tables he
[2:03:30] overthrew the seats of those that sold
[2:03:32] the doves and he told him at that time
[2:03:36] he said my it is written my house shall
[2:03:40] be called The House of Prayer amen now
[2:03:44] anytime in the scripture in the New
[2:03:45] Testament where we see the words it is
[2:03:49] written somewhere it is
[2:03:52] written this particular passage you can
[2:03:55] find in Isaiah
[2:03:57] 567 even them will I bring to my Holy
[2:04:00] Mountain and make them joyful In My
[2:04:02] House of Prayer their burnt offerings
[2:04:05] and their sacrifices shall be accepted
[2:04:07] upon mine Altar for mine house shall be
[2:04:10] called an House of Prayer for all
[2:04:15] people a House of Prayer
[2:04:19] now the the these men had made it a
[2:04:22] house of merchandise they had made it a
[2:04:25] place where there was so much buying and
[2:04:27] selling going on and even though the
[2:04:30] worshipper may have had a sincerity to
[2:04:32] bring the right sacrifice to the
[2:04:37] Lord there was so much commotion right
[2:04:42] inside of the temple compound till that
[2:04:45] any sincerity that they have was lost in
[2:04:48] the conopy of all that was going on it
[2:04:52] was such a a a vibration of noise that
[2:04:56] was going on and it was not holy unto
[2:04:58] the Lord that's
[2:05:02] right then Jesus told him you've made it
[2:05:05] a den of
[2:05:07] Thieves that word a den of Thieves is
[2:05:10] translated meaning to plunder to take
[2:05:14] away by force or to wrongfully steal
[2:05:19] or
[2:05:20] Loot and Jesus when he spoke those words
[2:05:25] in in in the account in Matthew he was
[2:05:28] letting them know that they were were
[2:05:31] not as holy as they wanted to let on as
[2:05:34] they that they were that they were
[2:05:38] plunderers and that's what the devil
[2:05:40] will do to you right he will plunder
[2:05:44] what God has given into your life will
[2:05:48] he wants the devil wants to cheat you
[2:05:51] out of all the good blessings that God
[2:05:54] could ever give to you he wants to cheat
[2:05:56] you out of your experience he wants to
[2:06:00] when he gets you away from the
[2:06:02] atmosphere that we create here together
[2:06:04] and he gets you away by yourself and you
[2:06:07] start opening up your mind and listening
[2:06:09] to him again then he starts plundering
[2:06:12] what God has already done he starts his
[2:06:17] looting
[2:06:19] right because what he really wants to do
[2:06:22] is he wants to inhabit amen amen he
[2:06:28] wants to do like some of these that have
[2:06:31] found empty
[2:06:33] houses and they have moved in and
[2:06:36] claimed control of these empty houses in
[2:06:40] the United States it's going on all over
[2:06:42] the United States where that land owners
[2:06:44] Property Owners can't even get these
[2:06:46] squatters out because the squatters have
[2:06:49] more rights than the American citizens
[2:06:51] do and the devil wants to make you think
[2:06:54] that he's got more rights as a squatter
[2:06:56] on your property while he plunders
[2:06:58] everything that God has ever done for
[2:07:01] you and he continues to loot and he
[2:07:03] don't need it no sir no sir he just
[2:07:06] don't want you to have it right and so
[2:07:08] he plunders until that you feel useless
[2:07:11] and worthless and of no value in the
[2:07:14] Kingdom until that you get down and down
[2:07:16] and down and down until that you feel
[2:07:19] totally black backslid and then you
[2:07:21] don't want to come to church and you
[2:07:23] don't want to press into the glory of
[2:07:24] the Lord you only want
[2:07:27] to do what feels
[2:07:31] good well in John's account in verse 17
[2:07:35] his disciples remembered that it was
[2:07:39] written the Zeal of thine house hath
[2:07:43] eaten me up yes the Zeal of thine house
[2:07:48] house hath eaten me up now in the New
[2:07:54] Testament this word zeal is
[2:07:59] Zeos and properly it means
[2:08:03] heat figuratively it means Zeal in a
[2:08:06] favorable
[2:08:09] sense ardor and in an unfavorable sense
[2:08:14] jealousy as of a husband figuratively of
[2:08:18] God or an enemy
[2:08:20] malice emul emul
[2:08:24] emulation envying fervent mind
[2:08:28] indignation jealousy Zeal these are all
[2:08:33] definitions that go around
[2:08:36] Zeal so again it is written the
[2:08:39] disciples remembered that there was
[2:08:41] something written about what was
[2:08:43] happening the Zeal of thine house hath
[2:08:46] eaten me up
[2:08:49] that can be found in Psalm
[2:08:53] 699 for the Zeal of thine house hath
[2:08:57] eaten me up and the reproaches of them
[2:09:01] that reproach thee are Fallen upon me
[2:09:05] that there there's so much in Psalm 69
[2:09:08] that is is applicable and and it talks
[2:09:11] about the Messiah and some other things
[2:09:13] there that you can go back and read but
[2:09:15] this is the scripture that this is the
[2:09:18] the the where it was written when the
[2:09:21] disciples remembered as Jesus has
[2:09:24] platted together this Whip and he drives
[2:09:27] all of these people out of the temple
[2:09:29] complex and all of those that sold and
[2:09:32] bought and the money changers and those
[2:09:35] that sold doves he drove them out right
[2:09:39] and the disciples are watching all of
[2:09:41] this and all of the sudden they remember
[2:09:43] that there's something written about him
[2:09:46] says the Zeal of thine house have eaten
[2:09:49] me hath eaten me
[2:09:51] up now in the strongs uh the the word
[2:09:55] zeal in the Old Testament is the Hebrew
[2:10:00] word
[2:10:02] 7068 I I forgot to write it down here I
[2:10:05] believe it's
[2:10:06] Kenan but it means
[2:10:09] AR a r d o r Zeal and
[2:10:15] jealousy and this is from color produced
[2:10:19] in face by Deep emotion then it gives
[2:10:23] definition ardor of jealousy of a
[2:10:27] husband ardor of zeal of men for God and
[2:10:32] of men of God for his people especially
[2:10:36] in a battle and then there is ardor of
[2:10:40] Anger of men against adversaries of God
[2:10:46] uh of men against adversaries an an
[2:10:49] ardor of Anger of God against
[2:10:52] men now let me give you the definition
[2:10:54] of ardor because it's not a word that we
[2:10:56] typically
[2:10:58] use from the Maran Webster D dictionary
[2:11:01] the definition of ardor is an often
[2:11:06] Restless or transitory anybody use the
[2:11:10] word
[2:11:11] transitory okay transitory means of
[2:11:15] brief
[2:11:17] duration and and often ref an often
[2:11:21] Restless or of brief duration warmth of
[2:11:31] feeling
[2:11:33] Zeal
[2:11:36] ardor a
[2:11:38] Restless or of brief duration warmth of
[2:11:43] feeling it also means extreme Vigor or
[2:11:47] energy
[2:11:49] intensity also gives the word zeal and
[2:11:55] loyalty
[2:11:57] now when I think of the word
[2:12:01] zeal I think of something
[2:12:07] constant but it appears that the word
[2:12:10] zeal and it being given a secondary
[2:12:16] definition of ardor which according to
[2:12:19] Maryam Webster is of brief duration it's
[2:12:24] transitory I see in this passage that
[2:12:29] Jesus did not walk around with a whip in
[2:12:31] his hand
[2:12:33] right but there was something that
[2:12:36] stirred him up that's right for a brief
[2:12:40] amount of time that caused him to drive
[2:12:44] these people out of the temple complex
[2:12:48] because that he was stirred up within
[2:12:52] himself that consumed his very being at
[2:12:56] that time that it drove him to Plat a
[2:13:00] whip and to if if he didn't use it to
[2:13:04] cause there to come a fear must have
[2:13:07] been a supernatural fear to come on that
[2:13:10] many people that when he started lifting
[2:13:13] it they
[2:13:16] moved now the Zeal of the Lord is not
[2:13:21] only for the Lord Jesus
[2:13:24] Christ neither is the Zeal of his house
[2:13:29] only for the Lord Jesus Christ the Zeal
[2:13:33] of thine house hath eaten me
[2:13:38] up and if I may in my own words tell you
[2:13:43] that the Zeal of thine
[2:13:46] house I'm going to say these four walls
[2:13:50] momentarily and even the Eagle's
[2:13:54] Refuge stirs me up from time to time and
[2:13:59] the Zeal of the Lord's house or the Zeal
[2:14:03] of the Lord's work or the Zeal of the
[2:14:06] Lord's property consumes
[2:14:10] me for brief
[2:14:14] durations now when those moment of zeal
[2:14:19] pass it doesn't make me any less of a
[2:14:22] Christian it doesn't make me any less of
[2:14:25] a Believer quite frankly my physical
[2:14:29] body could not
[2:14:32] handle extended times of some of what I
[2:14:36] go through in this head of mine and
[2:14:38] neither could
[2:14:40] yours
[2:14:43] right so God in his Mercy send something
[2:14:48] to stir us up to get us to walk in the
[2:14:53] vision so that we move forward at his
[2:14:57] appointed time Hallelujah have we ever
[2:15:00] missed God absolutely we
[2:15:03] have have we ever failed him of course
[2:15:06] we have but he's full of grace and he's
[2:15:09] full of mercy and his mercies are new
[2:15:12] every morning and I'm so thankful that
[2:15:15] his mercies are new every morning
[2:15:17] morning and that I can come to him and I
[2:15:20] can repent and I say Lord I'm sorry that
[2:15:23] I have failed you and I come back to you
[2:15:26] stir something up inside of me stir
[2:15:30] something inside of me
[2:15:33] right now this Zeal in Jesus's account
[2:15:38] in the gospels was for a natural
[2:15:43] house a place that he instituted
[2:15:48] a place that he said was going to be a
[2:15:51] house of prayer for all
[2:15:54] nations it's God's
[2:15:59] idea yet when men get
[2:16:03] involved and they don't allow these
[2:16:06] seasons of
[2:16:07] ardor these seasons of zeal to come and
[2:16:12] impact their lives and they live their
[2:16:15] whole life as ho hum ho hum it's all
[2:16:18] going to be all right in the end if we
[2:16:20] live that way then we're going to find
[2:16:23] ourselves the same as they did when
[2:16:26] Jesus was on the earth and it's going to
[2:16:28] be a house of merchandise rather than a
[2:16:32] place of
[2:16:35] worship we have been so blessed to have
[2:16:39] some
[2:16:42] guidelines some go to extremes with the
[2:16:45] guidelines and we're not going to go
[2:16:47] into that today but this has been made
[2:16:51] as a place of
[2:16:53] worship yes God gave us this it's hard
[2:16:57] for me to believe that it's 20 years
[2:17:00] that we have been 20
[2:17:03] years since anything has been
[2:17:06] done and God had an appointed
[2:17:10] time that something should now start
[2:17:13] happening under the Tabernacle
[2:17:16] right
[2:17:19] we
[2:17:20] chuckle when we hear the word
[2:17:26] soon and I thought that it was only
[2:17:29] people that walked in prophetic circles
[2:17:31] but I've been amused every time I
[2:17:32] watched The Chosen when they refer and
[2:17:35] Jesus says something about soon and he
[2:17:38] laughs
[2:17:40] yeah and I know exactly the
[2:17:43] feeling because soon in my book and soon
[2:17:47] in his book is two different
[2:17:50] definitions
[2:17:52] yes have I ever seen things happen
[2:17:55] rapidly from when they were prophesied
[2:17:58] to the time they happened
[2:18:00] absolutely have I seen things that were
[2:18:03] prophesied soon and I'm still waiting
[2:18:05] for them
[2:18:07] absolutely does that mean the words
[2:18:10] never going to come to pass well friends
[2:18:12] let me ask you do you think that they
[2:18:14] called Isaiah a false prophet did they
[2:18:17] did do you think when he prophesied that
[2:18:19] a virgin shall
[2:18:21] conceive and then he died and went to be
[2:18:25] with his fathers and that word was never
[2:18:28] performed during his
[2:18:30] lifetime and what awful things must have
[2:18:33] been said about the prophet Isaiah he
[2:18:36] must have had poison that day and it
[2:18:39] caused him to prophesy a falsehood and
[2:18:42] then I go even farther back than that
[2:18:45] because the Bible says that God told
[2:18:48] Moses that if somebody comes among you
[2:18:51] and they claim to be a prophet and they
[2:18:53] prophesy and it doesn't come to pass
[2:18:55] he's to be
[2:18:57] stoned now how does that work out for
[2:19:00] somebody like
[2:19:03] Isaiah because if they would have taken
[2:19:05] that to the literal point and said he's
[2:19:07] a false prophet and they stoned him to
[2:19:10] the point that he died because of that
[2:19:12] particular prophecy because it didn't
[2:19:15] happen in their
[2:19:16] timeline right then
[2:19:19] what because it did come to
[2:19:22] pass it eventually came to
[2:19:26] pass will I live to see all the
[2:19:29] Fulfillment of what God has said about
[2:19:30] this property I don't know I hope
[2:19:36] so I just have to tell you I hope so
[2:19:40] because I don't know what tomorrow holds
[2:19:43] quite
[2:19:44] honestly I could not tell you thus
[2:19:46] sayith the Lord that I live to see the
[2:19:48] Fulfillment of what I'm doing down there
[2:19:51] because we have no promise of tomorrow
[2:19:53] that's right yet we continue to ask the
[2:19:58] Lord to stir inside of us what he has
[2:20:02] for our lives for this property for this
[2:20:04] building for this property we continue
[2:20:07] to ask him Lord what is it that you want
[2:20:11] us to do because we go through seasons
[2:20:15] of time where we walk with without any
[2:20:23] Zeal and when we walk in a state where
[2:20:28] that we let too much time go by with
[2:20:32] really Without Really inquiring of the
[2:20:34] lord lord what do you want out of
[2:20:38] me we find
[2:20:41] ourselves
[2:20:43] intermingling with the
[2:20:46] world
[2:20:51] every and when we find ourselves
[2:20:54] intermingling with the
[2:20:56] world then we lose
[2:20:59] our vision our Zeal our desire to see
[2:21:05] what God has for our lives we see it Go
[2:21:08] by the
[2:21:10] wayside and we just set it aside and say
[2:21:13] you know we we we even we
[2:21:16] even
[2:21:18] come up with crazy phrases like maybe
[2:21:21] God doesn't really want me to have
[2:21:24] that maybe that's not really For Me
[2:21:27] Maybe that's not mine and and and we
[2:21:30] come up with these crazy phrases like
[2:21:33] that to try to uh satisfy our slackness
[2:21:38] to satisfy our time of really
[2:21:42] backsliding condition and we allow all
[2:21:46] of these things to overtake us and we
[2:21:53] see
[2:21:56] that there are
[2:21:58] churches all across the
[2:22:01] world that claim to believe the same
[2:22:04] thing that we
[2:22:07] believe and there are different ideas
[2:22:10] and different interpretations and
[2:22:12] different you know different um
[2:22:17] different churches have
[2:22:20] different things that they concentrate
[2:22:27] on that's okay yes it is okay every
[2:22:31] church is Sovereign God gave the pastor
[2:22:34] the sovereignty over that church to to
[2:22:36] lead that church that what is why he was
[2:22:38] put there and they're LED in different
[2:22:40] directions than we
[2:22:42] are and God has led us through the years
[2:22:45] by dreams and visions and prophecies and
[2:22:48] all of these things and we've been so
[2:22:50] grateful but one of the things that we
[2:22:52] have tried to stress in this church in
[2:22:55] this in in in the arena of our preaching
[2:22:58] is that God is calling for people who
[2:23:02] will be
[2:23:03] separate yes and not mixers right
[2:23:09] separat and we find
[2:23:12] that in
[2:23:15] the gospel when Jesus was coming into
[2:23:19] the temple that he was seeing the
[2:23:22] Fulfillment of people that had let down
[2:23:25] the bars and let down the bars and let
[2:23:28] down the bars and let down the you know
[2:23:30] they they they they the the priests came
[2:23:33] up with more things that the people had
[2:23:36] to do that's
[2:23:37] right it was
[2:23:39] religion that's right they came up when
[2:23:44] when the priest saw that people were
[2:23:47] trying to get closer to God then they
[2:23:49] would come up with one more thing that
[2:23:51] they had to do in their religious
[2:23:53] ceremonies and they kept doing this and
[2:23:55] doing this and then the priesthood
[2:23:57] became polluted and they started
[2:24:01] mixing with those of
[2:24:04] business and those of money-minded those
[2:24:07] that wanted to uh uh increase their
[2:24:10] wealth now see the priesthood was
[2:24:12] supposed to be uh kept by the
[2:24:16] tithe of the rest of the
[2:24:19] congregation but as with any man that is
[2:24:22] not born again you say were they not
[2:24:25] born
[2:24:26] again Jesus hadn't yet
[2:24:29] died no they were not born again they
[2:24:31] did not have the Holy Ghost the only one
[2:24:34] that had the Holy Ghost was John the
[2:24:35] Baptist and you saw what they did to him
[2:24:39] right and so these men because they were
[2:24:41] not born
[2:24:43] again there were crevices in them that
[2:24:48] they began to look for other ways to
[2:24:51] increase the money that was in their
[2:24:55] pockets and as they did they started
[2:24:58] making these connections with these
[2:25:01] merchandisers that they would say you
[2:25:03] know your your animal's not good enough
[2:25:06] and then they would put these big prices
[2:25:08] on these animals and the people had to
[2:25:10] pay it because there was a sincerity of
[2:25:14] worship in the people that they wanted
[2:25:16] to come to Jerusalem at the time of the
[2:25:18] Passover and they wanted to offer the
[2:25:20] sacrifice That was supposed to be uh
[2:25:23] offered at that
[2:25:25] time some of them could afford lambs and
[2:25:27] some of them could only afford the doves
[2:25:30] that's all they could afford so as they
[2:25:33] came and and all of this mixture was
[2:25:35] going on Jesus saw that this mixture was
[2:25:38] happening and he wanted to clear it
[2:25:42] out and he wants to clear out our
[2:25:44] mixture
[2:25:45] too he wants to clear all of our mixture
[2:25:48] out and that is one of the reasons why
[2:25:51] that I along with our pastor continue to
[2:25:55] uh continue to war against the spirit of
[2:25:59] romanism right because romanism it seems
[2:26:03] like that the spirit of romanism allows
[2:26:06] things to to creep in and over the years
[2:26:09] as people and preachers get to the point
[2:26:12] where that they feel ah it's okay it's
[2:26:15] you know H you compare to all the rest
[2:26:17] of the world it's not so
[2:26:21] bad it it's you know so what if we
[2:26:24] celebrate Christmas right so what if we
[2:26:27] have a Christmas tree I mean we're we're
[2:26:28] not kneeling down before it and
[2:26:30] worshiping it right
[2:26:33] right I didn't say you
[2:26:36] were but apparently God recognized that
[2:26:40] the same kind of a spirit that was in
[2:26:41] Jeremiah's day when he
[2:26:44] prophesied learn not the way of the
[2:26:48] Heathen he saw it coming in our day and
[2:26:50] he didn't want us to have any part of it
[2:26:53] and then we start making
[2:26:57] excuses through a prophet messenger's
[2:27:00] words we start making excuses as to why
[2:27:03] maybe it's not so
[2:27:05] wrong but I tell you that we have to
[2:27:09] continue to cry out against these things
[2:27:12] because if we let down the
[2:27:15] bar then we become in this place where
[2:27:19] that we just
[2:27:21] totally uh honest we allow those things
[2:27:25] to bring us to a backslid
[2:27:29] condition and God really wants to stir
[2:27:32] up this Zeal inside of us from time to
[2:27:36] time I'm not saying it's 100% of the
[2:27:39] time he wants to stir up this thing
[2:27:42] inside of us that we
[2:27:44] press now this zeal may be once a week
[2:27:48] it may be once a day it may be once a
[2:27:50] month I don't know the frequency of this
[2:27:53] Zeal and for some things it's longer
[2:27:56] spans of time between the Zeal that we
[2:27:58] feel on the inside to pursue something
[2:28:03] again and so we have got to be mindful
[2:28:07] to hear the word of the Lord to hear the
[2:28:09] voice of the Lord when he comes to us
[2:28:12] and he wants to stir up a Zeal with
[2:28:14] inside of us because
[2:28:17] quite frankly it's not about these four
[2:28:24] walls right I do believe that this land
[2:28:27] is precious to him it is it is the same
[2:28:31] way as Jerusalem is precious to
[2:28:37] him that's why that that piece of land
[2:28:40] has been fought over for years and years
[2:28:45] and years
[2:28:48] yes because there's something on that
[2:28:52] land that God put his stamp on and said
[2:28:57] it's
[2:28:59] mine God put his stamp on this piece of
[2:29:02] property and he said it's mine but more
[2:29:06] than that he put his stamp on you and
[2:29:09] said you are
[2:29:14] mine you are mine
[2:29:17] and so as the words of Jesus in John
[2:29:22] Chapter 2 it is necessary for us to hear
[2:29:26] the words of the Lord in our heart and
[2:29:29] in our mind the Zeal of thine house hath
[2:29:33] consumed me or eaten me
[2:29:40] up Acts
[2:29:44] 7:44 our fathers had the tabern tacle of
[2:29:47] witness in the wilderness as he had
[2:29:49] appointed speaking unto Moses that he
[2:29:51] should make it according to the fashion
[2:29:54] that he had seen which also our fathers
[2:29:56] that came after brought in with Jesus
[2:29:59] into the possession of the Gentiles whom
[2:30:02] God drave out before the face of our
[2:30:04] fathers unto the days of David who found
[2:30:08] favor before God and desired to find a
[2:30:11] tabernacle for the god of Jacob but
[2:30:15] Solomon built him in house
[2:30:18] how be it the most high dwelleth not in
[2:30:21] temples made with hands as saith the
[2:30:24] prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is
[2:30:28] my foot stol what house will you build
[2:30:31] me sayith the Lord or what is the place
[2:30:35] of my rest hath not my hand made all
[2:30:39] these
[2:30:40] things and then again in 1 Corinthians
[2:30:43] 3:16 know you not that you you are the
[2:30:47] temple of God and that the spirit of God
[2:30:49] dwelleth in
[2:30:51] you and again in 1 Corinthians 69 and 20
[2:30:57] what know you not that your body is the
[2:30:59] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in
[2:31:03] you which you have of God and you are
[2:31:06] not your own for you are bought with a
[2:31:10] price therefore glorify God in your body
[2:31:14] and in your spirit which are Gods so as
[2:31:19] as we're looking at this today I want us
[2:31:22] to understand that we're not talking
[2:31:25] necessarily about the building or the
[2:31:28] property although God does still stir up
[2:31:31] our Zeal concerning this property
[2:31:34] concerning this building because it is a
[2:31:37] part of the vision because it is a part
[2:31:40] of his mandate over this house over us
[2:31:44] so God has to come along and stir us up
[2:31:49] right and stir he
[2:31:53] does and when he
[2:31:56] stirs the enemy
[2:32:02] stirs
[2:32:04] does because anytime that you make a
[2:32:06] move toward God the enemy is not
[2:32:12] happy because he doesn't want you
[2:32:14] accomplishing your
[2:32:18] Destiny so he gets mad and he
[2:32:21] fights and if there's no Zeal in
[2:32:27] us then we do like parents do sometimes
[2:32:31] have it your
[2:32:32] way
[2:32:33] uhoh
[2:32:37] uhoh have it your
[2:32:45] way
[2:32:47] we've seen through the years as parents
[2:32:50] have become
[2:32:53] non-parents or as young adults
[2:33:00] teenagers didn't think that their
[2:33:04] parents had anything that they could
[2:33:06] tell
[2:33:08] them Rebellion all worked in them
[2:33:13] right and parents had to get to the
[2:33:15] place where they said have it your
[2:33:22] way and they had to commit them to the
[2:33:25] Lord knowing that they had placed the
[2:33:28] token over them but there was a seed of
[2:33:30] rebellion that had to be dealt with now
[2:33:33] sometimes God has had to deal very very
[2:33:36] harshly with people where the seeds of
[2:33:39] rebellion before that they ever got back
[2:33:41] to where that they belonged that's
[2:33:44] right and by the grace of God there have
[2:33:47] been moms and dads and mothers and
[2:33:49] fathers in Zion who have been willing to
[2:33:52] pray who have allowed the Lord to stir
[2:33:55] up a Zeal in them a a a a a an intensity
[2:33:59] in them to pray uh like they wouldn't
[2:34:02] normally pray for the release of of
[2:34:06] prisoners out of bondage that they were
[2:34:08] in for these spiritual prisoners that
[2:34:11] were in bondage that they couldn't seem
[2:34:13] to get free and because of some of your
[2:34:16] prayers there have been people that have
[2:34:19] been set free from the bondage they were
[2:34:21] in because you allowed the Holy Ghost to
[2:34:24] stir something an intensity inside of
[2:34:27] you that you prayed with a greater
[2:34:29] fervency than ever before because it was
[2:34:32] the right season to bring them out of
[2:34:34] the
[2:34:40] bondage now we can't use that as an
[2:34:43] excuse to never pray with an intensity
[2:34:48] but there are times that God stirs up
[2:34:50] the intensity inside of us because it is
[2:34:53] a season for moving and shaking and
[2:34:55] stirring the
[2:34:57] devil we don't even like to think about
[2:34:59] stirring up the devil but there are
[2:35:01] times that God wants us to stir up the
[2:35:06] devil sometimes he wants us to offend
[2:35:09] the mind sometimes he wants us to call
[2:35:12] somebody to get
[2:35:15] angry
[2:35:16] because the stirring up does a greater
[2:35:20] work than just the anger the stirring up
[2:35:24] causes sometimes people to see their
[2:35:26] waywardness and it causes them to see
[2:35:29] the foolishness of their actions and it
[2:35:31] causes them to come to a place of
[2:35:33] repentance because they're worked in
[2:35:36] such an intensity they realize I'm out
[2:35:39] of my
[2:35:42] head and it causes there to be a
[2:35:44] repentance and an eye openening and
[2:35:46] something can be seen in that period of
[2:35:50] time but the Zeal of thine house hath
[2:35:53] eaten me up and again it's not about a
[2:35:56] building made with hands it's about the
[2:35:59] house remember in the Book of Ezekiel
[2:36:02] where God came to Ezekiel and he said
[2:36:04] Ezekiel I want you to show the house to
[2:36:07] the
[2:36:13] house I want you to show them
[2:36:16] I want you to show the house what the
[2:36:18] house looks like whether it be disarray
[2:36:22] or whether it be backslid or whatever it
[2:36:24] is I want you to show them where they're
[2:36:28] at and Ezekiel he goes and he does what
[2:36:31] God He commands him to do he shows the
[2:36:34] house the house and that's what
[2:36:35] preachers do they show the house the
[2:36:41] house and it's not for us to become
[2:36:44] angry it's not for us to quit church
[2:36:47] it's because of the mercy of God that he
[2:36:49] wants to draw us to himself to become in
[2:36:52] a closer relationship with him because
[2:36:56] as the Zeal of the house stirred him up
[2:37:00] when he walked the Earth he wants the
[2:37:02] Zeal of the house to be stirred up in us
[2:37:06] he wants us the Zeal of this house
[2:37:09] because the Holy Ghost dwells on the
[2:37:12] inside because this is the chamber
[2:37:16] because this is the Tabernacle of the
[2:37:19] Holy Ghost he wants us to be stirred
[2:37:24] up and he wants us to be stirred up with
[2:37:28] with uh with more
[2:37:31] frequency than we have in the past
[2:37:35] because I I I wished I could find the
[2:37:40] exact quote I've not been able to find
[2:37:43] it and you may have it somewhere that
[2:37:45] you can show show it to me but I know
[2:37:46] it's there where we will speed up and
[2:37:50] they'll slow down and we'll meet in the
[2:37:56] middle and if we're speeding
[2:38:00] up the intensity of the battle is going
[2:38:03] to heat up yes the frequency of the
[2:38:06] stirring is going to be
[2:38:09] more it because that we're speeding up
[2:38:15] when you're going slow and and every you
[2:38:18] know it seems that there's greater
[2:38:20] distances in between the trials But as
[2:38:23] time goes on and things are speeding up
[2:38:26] that means the the intensity or the
[2:38:29] frequency rather of the trial is going
[2:38:32] to come the frequency of God dealing
[2:38:35] with us to become zealous for the house
[2:38:38] is going to be more frequent he is going
[2:38:41] to speak to us more frequently about
[2:38:44] ourselves about what is going on inside
[2:38:46] of us and you say preacher we hear this
[2:38:48] all the time yes maybe we do but God
[2:38:52] doesn't want us to carry anything in our
[2:38:55] lives that is against the word of God
[2:38:58] even as brother Shelly stood here before
[2:39:00] I came to the pulpit and he talked about
[2:39:03] that hidden place in the king that
[2:39:05] hidden
[2:39:06] Kingdom you remember brother Brandon
[2:39:08] preached the message door and a doors
[2:39:11] and he talked about how that there are
[2:39:13] people that invite Jesus in just stand
[2:39:16] right there and don't go any farther
[2:39:18] that's
[2:39:20] right but as we go on in the Christian
[2:39:23] walk we may invite him into another room
[2:39:25] and in another room and in another room
[2:39:28] until after a while we feel like that he
[2:39:30] has possession of all of us and then he
[2:39:33] comes along and he stir up the Zeal of
[2:39:36] the house and there's an intensity that
[2:39:39] grows and there's something that comes
[2:39:41] up and we
[2:39:43] realize I've got another room
[2:39:47] that I've not let him
[2:39:53] into you remember
[2:39:56] how in in in three out of four of the
[2:39:59] instances when this was told in the
[2:40:01] Gospels it says separately that
[2:40:06] Jesus drove out those that sold
[2:40:10] doves but there's a dove that I carry
[2:40:14] that cannot be bought or so sold there's
[2:40:17] a dove that you carry that cannot be
[2:40:19] bought or sold it's the dove of the Holy
[2:40:23] Ghost you remember in in several
[2:40:25] instances when brother Brandon would
[2:40:27] talk about how that we uh we at times we
[2:40:32] do things that drives away the dove of
[2:40:36] the Holy
[2:40:37] Ghost we drive him
[2:40:40] away he very clearly said it doesn't
[2:40:44] make you a non-Christian
[2:40:46] it doesn't make you never born
[2:40:49] again it means that you've Disturbed the
[2:40:52] Peace of the
[2:40:54] dove and all it takes is
[2:40:57] repentance and calling the dove
[2:41:00] back and as we go forward in the things
[2:41:04] of God as as as we mature as Believers
[2:41:08] we we we become more sensitive to that
[2:41:12] flight when we do things and we don't
[2:41:15] leave him out on the limb for extended
[2:41:18] periods of time like we have in the past
[2:41:21] we recognize I can't live without you
[2:41:24] Dove of the Holy Ghost I've got to have
[2:41:26] you dwelling on the inside I'm sorry for
[2:41:30] what I did and and and I want you to
[2:41:32] come back cleanse me and Purify Me and
[2:41:35] come back and dwell where you belong
[2:41:39] right but what one of the things that we
[2:41:43] in society do
[2:41:45] I heard a Ukrainian preacher say this
[2:41:48] line we
[2:41:50] normalize what God wants to
[2:41:53] neutralize that's
[2:41:55] it we
[2:41:57] normalize what God wants to
[2:42:02] neutralize he wants to kill
[2:42:06] it neutralize it that it has no more
[2:42:09] effect in our
[2:42:12] lives last weekend brother Shelly came
[2:42:15] with a word from the Lord two
[2:42:18] words apathy and
[2:42:22] addiction and there are those
[2:42:25] who have
[2:42:28] habits rather than allowing the Lord to
[2:42:31] deal with them they normalize
[2:42:35] them is the trth intrusive thoughts
[2:42:39] people normalize them instead of
[2:42:41] allowing the Holy Spirit to neutralize
[2:42:44] them that's right
[2:42:47] generational
[2:42:50] diseases well my mama had
[2:42:53] it my grandmother had
[2:42:56] it her mother had it so I guess it's
[2:43:01] part of my DNA I guess I'll have that
[2:43:03] same
[2:43:05] problem we normalize what ought to be
[2:43:08] neutralized the blood of Jesus Christ is
[2:43:11] against those
[2:43:13] things generational stuff stub berness
[2:43:16] that's
[2:43:19] right my mama was strong willed my daddy
[2:43:22] was strong willed I guess I will be
[2:43:26] too do you really want to carry
[2:43:32] that I don't want to I love my parents I
[2:43:35] love them both very much and they serve
[2:43:37] the Lord with all their heart but there
[2:43:39] are some things that were passed on to
[2:43:42] me through the bloodline that I don't
[2:43:44] want
[2:43:46] right I don't want my children and my
[2:43:49] grandchildren to carry
[2:43:50] them I don't even want my brothers and
[2:43:53] sisters in the flesh to carry
[2:43:56] them I want the blood of Jesus Christ to
[2:43:59] neutralize it and deal with it because I
[2:44:03] don't want to the the I don't want
[2:44:05] anything that causes the dove to take
[2:44:10] flight in that day he drove out those
[2:44:15] that were selling the doves you've got
[2:44:16] to remember that the doves were part of
[2:44:19] worship the Lambs were part of worship
[2:44:22] but the way in which they were doing it
[2:44:24] was not a part of it it was because
[2:44:27] somebody had not allowed the Zeal of the
[2:44:30] Lord for the Lord's House to be stirred
[2:44:33] up in
[2:44:35] them and so I just leave you with this
[2:44:37] word
[2:44:38] today will you allow the
[2:44:41] Zeal of his
[2:44:44] house
[2:44:45] to eat you
[2:44:47] up will you allow the Zeal of his house
[2:44:52] to consume
[2:44:54] you I'll lay it out one more
[2:44:57] time you're not going to probably carry
[2:45:00] Zeal
[2:45:05] 24/7 yet there's something stirring
[2:45:08] inside of the house there's something
[2:45:11] stirring inside of the house that when
[2:45:13] you see something that is arai in your
[2:45:18] house in your
[2:45:20] [Music]
[2:45:23] house that you deal with it you allow
[2:45:26] that Zeal to be stirred up you don't
[2:45:29] ignore it you don't put it aside and say
[2:45:32] well you know everybody else is doing
[2:45:36] it seems to be part of society and 2024
[2:45:40] you know it's it's no big
[2:45:44] deal
[2:45:45] I go back to the you know when when when
[2:45:48] brother brandham talked about I Love
[2:45:54] Lucy to
[2:45:56] us with what we're seeing in
[2:46:02] advertisements I Love Lucy is so
[2:46:13] innocent i' be honest with you I've
[2:46:15] never seen a full episode of I Love
[2:46:18] Lucy I know who she was seen a little
[2:46:21] clip of it but so innocent compared to
[2:46:25] what we
[2:46:27] see what's out here today yet he looked
[2:46:31] beyond the innocence of
[2:46:34] that it was for his day it was
[2:46:40] vulgar it is vulgar it is not something
[2:46:42] that we need to be feasting on
[2:46:46] but it is it with what is around us at
[2:46:50] the
[2:46:50] moment it's pretty
[2:46:53] Innocent but he looked beyond that and
[2:46:57] he saw he was preaching to the people in
[2:46:59] the 50s and the 6s and he was giving
[2:47:02] them something that was relevant for
[2:47:03] their day because he did not want them
[2:47:07] to normalize it he wanted them to
[2:47:10] neutralize the effect that it would have
[2:47:13] in their homes he wanted them to
[2:47:15] neutralize it and I'm preaching the same
[2:47:18] thing today we don't want to normalize
[2:47:21] the spirits that are around us we want
[2:47:24] to neutralize them because we don't want
[2:47:27] them to have an effect in our lives we
[2:47:30] don't want them to have a future effect
[2:47:32] in our children because although you may
[2:47:35] be able to just look at it and
[2:47:38] say it has no effect on me because
[2:47:41] you've got more of the Holy Ghost but if
[2:47:44] you don't if you normalize it in your
[2:47:47] house and then your children that may
[2:47:49] not have the Holy Ghost they start
[2:47:51] latching on to
[2:47:53] it and as they start latching on to it
[2:47:56] it consumes them rather than the Holy
[2:48:00] Ghost something consumes them that they
[2:48:04] can't get out from under that's right
[2:48:06] and we got a bigger
[2:48:09] problem but I'm glad that my God is a
[2:48:12] problem solver I'm glad that he is a
[2:48:15] neutralizer I'm glad that he knows how
[2:48:17] to take the things that we'll give to
[2:48:18] him as he stirs up in us musicians are
[2:48:22] coming as he stirs up in us as he stirs
[2:48:24] us from time to time he stirs us and
[2:48:27] your stirring time may be different than
[2:48:29] this brother or sister over here but God
[2:48:32] comes and he stirs and he moves and he
[2:48:34] helps us because he knows where we're at
[2:48:36] he knows where we're sitting he knows
[2:48:39] what we have feasted on this week he
[2:48:41] knows what we have partaken of and he
[2:48:43] knows how to stir up the Zeal inside of
[2:48:46] us he knows how to stir the intensity
[2:48:49] inside of
[2:48:51] us till that we will come to him and say
[2:48:54] papa the Zeal of your house has eaten me
[2:49:01] up I cannot leave this four walls that
[2:49:06] we call a sanctuary I cannot leave it
[2:49:09] today in the condition that I am I
[2:49:12] cannot leave because you have bur up
[2:49:15] something in me that I realize I have to
[2:49:18] repent I need to get clean of this oh
[2:49:21] I'm so glad that I've learned that
[2:49:23] repentance does not take three
[2:49:28] days I'm glad that I don't have to walk
[2:49:31] under the condemnation uh and work in my
[2:49:35] repentance to get good enough for God
[2:49:38] for a week and a half until that he
[2:49:40] takes it through a board and says okay
[2:49:42] we'll forgive you this time oh no no no
[2:49:45] no that's not who my God is he is Jesus
[2:49:49] Christ the same yesterday and today and
[2:49:53] forever and when he came and he shed his
[2:49:55] blood at Calvary fulfilling What was
[2:49:58] seen from before the foundation of the
[2:50:00] world the lamb that was slain that blood
[2:50:04] came to cleanse me all I had to do was
[2:50:08] come and repent and turn and go another
[2:50:12] way a different way his way
[2:50:17] it doesn't have to run through the
[2:50:21] board it doesn't even have to run
[2:50:23] through the pastor that's right it's
[2:50:26] between you that's right and the owner
[2:50:29] of this house yes sir and the owner of
[2:50:32] this house beckons to us and he stirs up
[2:50:35] an intensity inside of us and says
[2:50:38] you've carried that long enough amen
[2:50:41] you've normalized that long
[2:50:43] enough you've you let that disease
[2:50:45] operate in your body long enough you've
[2:50:47] let that ailment in you you've let it be
[2:50:50] normalized long enough and you said it
[2:50:52] was just a part of your DNA you don't
[2:50:55] have to carry it
[2:50:57] anymore get rid of it glory to God that
[2:51:01] generational thing that you've
[2:51:03] carried or I I'm not just pointing at
[2:51:07] you that generational thing that we've
[2:51:10] normalized said that's just the way of
[2:51:13] people
[2:51:15] we're all built different and we all
[2:51:17] have our
[2:51:19] issues oh
[2:51:21] friends we've got to quit
[2:51:23] normalizing these things and let the
[2:51:27] blood of Jesus Christ cleanse us from
[2:51:30] all of our
[2:51:31] unrighteousness we must come to him and
[2:51:35] say Lord stir up the intensity that is
[2:51:38] needed as you stand to your feet stir up
[2:51:41] the intensity that that I need at this
[2:51:45] moment Stir It Up Stir It Up Stir It Up

[2:52:13] those that it says well someday I'll

[3:05:09] good Lord with every breath that I am in
[3:05:15] S I will sing of the
[3:05:19] goodness of
[3:05:22] God oh I will

[3:05:34] goodness of
[3:05:37] God thank you
[3:05:39] Jesus thank you wonderful savior we
[3:05:43] thank you for your word today Lord it
[3:05:46] can be applied in so many different ways
[3:05:49] thank you for the holy spirit that was
[3:05:51] here to teach us thank you Father for
[3:05:55] the wonderful quickening of the Lord
[3:05:57] that that that as as your word was going
[3:06:00] forth we were able to
[3:06:02] identify and locate some things some
[3:06:05] places some thought patterns that we
[3:06:09] needed to see shifted in us so Lord we
[3:06:12] take authority now over the works of
[3:06:14] darkness that try to rule in the house
[3:06:17] of the Lord and we ask oh God that you
[3:06:21] will have supreme authority and
[3:06:24] leadership in our lives we desire more
[3:06:27] than anything else the leadership of the
[3:06:30] Holy Ghost no matter what we Face Lord
[3:06:34] and Lord concerning this place you told
[3:06:36] us to prepare you a
[3:06:39] place and Lord that's what we desire to
[3:06:41] do is prepare you a place so that you
[3:06:44] can come and have your wonderful way
[3:06:48] Lord we don't believe that it's for for
[3:06:50] everybody and we don't believe that it's
[3:06:52] for the whole world but we believe Lord
[3:06:55] that you have already ordained already
[3:06:58] already
[3:06:59] chosen those wounded Eagles who would
[3:07:03] need to take refuge who would need to be
[3:07:06] refreshed and renewed Lord help us to
[3:07:09] prepare the place help us to get the
[3:07:12] place ready
[3:07:13] for them to come hallelujah hallelujah
[3:07:18] thank you for the provision Lord right
[3:07:20] now we thank you for the provision
[3:07:23] Hallelujah we have never emphasized
[3:07:26] entertainment we have never emphasized a
[3:07:29] place to eat that's why we built
[3:07:31] everything else that's why prayer house
[3:07:34] prayer chapels took precedence that's
[3:07:37] why this place has had preceden here but
[3:07:41] Lord we believe that you have called us
[3:07:43] to prepare a place for your bride to
[3:07:46] gather and in order to do that we need
[3:07:48] natural sustenance as well and we need
[3:07:51] something for the young people Lord I
[3:07:53] wanted a place as you began to talk to
[3:07:55] me years ago I wanted a place where the
[3:07:58] young people could come where the church
[3:08:00] people could come and have Fellowship
[3:08:03] not just on Sunday not just on Tuesday
[3:08:05] night but that they would find this to
[3:08:08] be a safe place for their children and I
[3:08:10] don't believe you're going to allow the
[3:08:12] en enemy me to do anything out here on
[3:08:15] the front that's going to hinder that we
[3:08:17] take authority over every plot or plan
[3:08:20] of the enemy and we just believe that
[3:08:23] you'll redeem it Lord for the good of
[3:08:25] this body in this house in The Wonderful
[3:08:29] Name of Jesus we pray and the saint said
[3:08:32] why don't you turn around and greet one
[3:08:34] another while you're close greet one
[3:08:36] another just a moment we're not going to
[3:08:39] be here but another
[3:08:42] minute
[3:08:51] [Music]
[3:08:53] just slip back to your seats when you're
[3:08:55] done it's not to rush
[3:08:58] you but sometimes we take this time and
[3:09:01] then we go to the vestibule and we greet
[3:09:02] the same ones and speak to the same ones
[3:09:05] and chat with the same
[3:09:10] ones how many of you are blessed by the
[3:09:13] word we heard today Hallelujah didn't
[3:09:16] brother gy do a good job absolutely
[3:09:19] let's thank
[3:09:20] God
[3:09:26] hallelujah amen just remain standing if
[3:09:28] you would that will help me realize that
[3:09:31] it's not uh that I'm don't I Don't
[3:09:33] Preach I'm not preaching now we're
[3:09:35] dismissing all right and uh remember the
[3:09:39] service Tuesday night at
[3:09:41] 7:00 and uh uh I don't know there's just
[3:09:44] a lot of things in my mind and in my
[3:09:46] heart right now that uh God is stirring
[3:09:49] it must be the Zeal of the Lord must be
[3:09:51] the Zeal of the Lord's house so let's
[3:09:54] pray for one another uh next Sunday
[3:09:56] let's bring an offering uh and and
[3:09:58] dedicate it we'll go back to the first
[3:10:00] of the month uh at some point but let's
[3:10:03] bring an offering next week and
[3:10:05] dedicated it uh toward the furtherance
[3:10:08] of the vision I I don't want you to look
[3:10:10] at it like you're you're you're giving
[3:10:13] to build a fellowship hall you're you're
[3:10:15] giving to finish the work of the Lord
[3:10:18] and to further the vision that God has
[3:10:20] given us for this house and uh after
[3:10:23] that we've got to find a way of making
[3:10:25] provision for people to stay because one
[3:10:28] of the things the Lord said in the
[3:10:30] initial Visions was he wanted places for
[3:10:32] people to be able to stay when they come
[3:10:34] to visit that they could stay on the
[3:10:37] grounds because the grounds were watched
[3:10:39] over anyway I I'm on the stream and I
[3:10:42] can't say too much you know I don't know
[3:10:45] if you have any idea what we deal with
[3:10:47] during the course of a week but from the
[3:10:50] time we see you till we see you again we
[3:10:53] have already heard every week every week
[3:10:57] we hear the rumors of what others say
[3:11:00] and uh some of the young people
[3:11:02] particularly around the message they say
[3:11:04] well when I listen to their Church they
[3:11:06] make it sound like they're
[3:11:11] special
[3:11:14] haven't you ever heard of
[3:11:16] election don't you understand that we
[3:11:18] are
[3:11:20] special and uh then they say things like
[3:11:23] well of course you know I told you they
[3:11:24] talk about our guitar standing up so
[3:11:26] y'all ought to sit
[3:11:29] down and they say things like they act
[3:11:32] like brother shell is something special
[3:11:34] he
[3:11:36] is because I know who I belong
[3:11:39] to and and they act like that place is
[3:11:42] some kind of special play you know what
[3:11:45] I'm I'm going to be honest I wouldn't
[3:11:46] want to give my life to a body of
[3:11:49] Believers that didn't have a
[3:11:51] vision for why they're
[3:11:54] together just think about that don't you
[3:11:56] think everybody ought to be in a church
[3:11:58] that they can say my church is the right
[3:12:00] church for me to be in you don't have to
[3:12:03] say anything about anybody else's
[3:12:06] church and I'll just tell you like I've
[3:12:08] said for if this ain't the
[3:12:11] place
[3:12:13] if this is not the place then I'm going
[3:12:15] to have to find something else but I
[3:12:18] believe this is the place there's no
[3:12:20] place like this
[3:12:22] place and and God will let you feel that
[3:12:24] way if you'll open up your heart and
[3:12:26] that's the way you ought to feel about
[3:12:28] where you're called To Worship I know
[3:12:30] that in denominational circles people
[3:12:32] choose churches for different reasons if
[3:12:34] they've got a nursery if they've got a
[3:12:36] kids program if they've got a dance
[3:12:39] class if they've
[3:12:41] got come on but the bride doesn't choose
[3:12:44] a place to worship based on on on
[3:12:47] facilities or
[3:12:50] programs that's she chooses her place
[3:12:53] based on the call of God in their life
[3:12:56] where God has called you and once God's
[3:12:58] called you somewhere it ought not to
[3:13:00] ever grow old you ought to be thankful
[3:13:02] for what God has given us I am so
[3:13:05] grateful and so thankful and I look
[3:13:08] forward to the rest of what God is going
[3:13:09] to do and I'm blessed from what I've
[3:13:12] heard to today very blessed so we're not
[3:13:14] going to hold you any longer we're going
[3:13:16] to dismiss you to go today in the name
[3:13:18] of the Lord don't forget to pray over
[3:13:21] these requests pray every day for Israel
[3:13:24] I know you are we haven't mentioned it
[3:13:26] in a few weeks but we're busy with it
[3:13:28] during the week praying and believing
[3:13:30] God we have have heard of course what
[3:13:33] you have heard that that many of the
[3:13:35] hostages who they thought originally
[3:13:38] were alive were never alive they were
[3:13:40] killed in the initial raid and and take
[3:13:42] it out can you imagine can you imagine
[3:13:46] taking the dead bodies away so that the
[3:13:48] families would grieve and worry and be
[3:13:51] concerned and then it trickling out the
[3:13:53] truth trickling out like now what what a
[3:13:56] horrible horrible thing to do to anybody
[3:13:59] to your worst enemy but there are
[3:14:02] hostages alive we want every one of them
[3:14:04] to come out alive we believe that God
[3:14:07] has his hand in everything that's going
[3:14:09] on in the world God bless you you are
[3:14:11] dismissed to go in the name of the Lord
