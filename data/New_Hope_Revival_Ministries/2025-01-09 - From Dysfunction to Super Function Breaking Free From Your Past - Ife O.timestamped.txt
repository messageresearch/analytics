[0:00] I'm about to move from
[0:03] dysfunction to Super function I I'm not
[0:07] going to continue in Dysfunctional
[0:09] living but I'm going to move up into a
[0:12] supernatural way of living my life which
[0:15] is highly functional somebody said I'm
[0:19] going to be highly functional because
[0:22] the Holy
[0:24] Ghost is living in
[0:27] me he's not crippled by one parent
[0:30] upbringing he's not crippled by
[0:34] abuse he's not crippled by all the
[0:37] things that you and I have dealt with I
[0:40] had a
[0:41] revelation you know a revelation can get
[0:44] you through some pretty tough stuff I
[0:47] had a revelation that I had a
[0:52] father and I used to tell uh uh uh
[0:56] myself I I have no earthly father in
[1:00] seems but I have no father but God he is
[1:04] my father he is my Abba he is my papa
[1:09] and making that the confession of my
[1:12] life it became more than enough to get
[1:15] me over because you got life and power
[1:19] and authority in your mouth come on but
[1:23] many times through the years I had to
[1:25] weed my
[1:27] garden and I had to make sure that
[1:30] rejection didn't become a part of who I
[1:33] was amen and I didn't want an orphan
[1:36] spirit because one of the worst things
[1:39] you can bring into your relationship
[1:41] with Christ is this mentality that I was
[1:44] not wanted in my natural family and so
[1:48] I'm just an orphan in the spiritual life
[1:51] no Sur there are no orphans in the
[1:54] family of God you belong here in his
[1:58] family I don't just I mean in this
[2:00] church I mean in this family he's a good
[2:03] Papa he always stands for us when we
[2:07] need him to he he keeps his
[2:12] word and I want you to know that
[2:14] regardless of what your backstory is you
[2:19] cannot stay in that place of hurt of
[2:24] woundedness of
[2:27] weakness you you can't spend your whole
[2:31] life
[2:34] nursing those harsh painful
[2:38] emotions you've got to know who you are
[2:42] because you know
[2:44] who's it's possessive whose you are
[2:48] there's no room for laziness or
[2:51] slackness in the life of somebody with a
[2:54] with a troubled
[2:55] backstory we've got to remain ever
[2:58] Vigilant ever ever diligent
[3:01] we can't let it grow
[3:04] overnight amen if we do it will rule us
[3:09] it troubles us today but if we don't
[3:12] deal with it today tomorrow it will rule
[3:15] us it will dictate to us how we filter
[3:20] everything that
[3:23] happens but what we must do if it if it
[3:26] if something happens or we hear
[3:29] something or smell something or feel
[3:31] something if we find ourselves in a
[3:34] familiar situation that brings all that
[3:36] pain back we have to recognize it for
[3:39] what it is and we choose today today I'm
[3:43] going to dig that today I'm pulling it
[3:45] out tomorrow 15 more may spring up but
[3:49] today I'm going to deal with the one
[3:51] that's there tomorrow I'll deal with the
[3:54] rest but I won't let that
[3:57] dictate the kind of cre Christian I am
[4:01] the kind of father I am the kind of
[4:03] husband I
[4:05] am the kind of son I
[4:08] am I'm trying to tell you I'm trying to
[4:12] tell you today that you can overcome one
[4:16] thought at a time one emotion at a time
[4:20] one trial at a time you can you can have
[4:23] Victory you can get on top of it one at
[4:27] a time you can eat this big old fat
[4:31] elephant one bite at a time you can
[4:35] raise up into the stature of Christ and
[4:38] his Perfection one step one
[4:43] virtue one
[4:45] victory at a time somebody said it's a
[4:48] never ending cycle oh no there's an
[4:54] end when is the end well it may not be
[4:56] today and it may not be tomorrow but
[4:58] there's an end to this
[5:00] is there is an overcoming
[5:04] bride oh yes who's being reared up
[5:09] trained set in order oh she doesn't
[5:13] always like
[5:16] it but there is a
[5:19] voice it comes from another realm that
[5:23] screams to us in this hour get in
[5:27] Step stay in
[5:30] step because you've got an eternity to
[5:33] gain
