TRANSCRIPT
========================================
out freely psalm 128 verse 1 blessed is everyone that feareth the lord that walketh in his ways this is how you know someone fears the lord because they're walking in his ways for thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands happy shalt thou be and it shall be well with thee how many of you like to claim that as a personal promise thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house thy children like olive plants round about thy table behold that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the lord the lord shall bless thee out of zion and thou shalt see the good of jerusalem all the days of thy life yea thou shall see thy children's children how many of you'd like to see your children's children you'd like to see them serving the lord and peace upon israel i want you to know that's a power-packed six verses of blessing and it all is addressed to the man that fears the lord and we can claim many of those promises for the women who fear the lord as well but this was directed toward a man that will fear the lord i want to read while you're standing three more verses if you'll turn to ephesians chapter six i'd like to read the first three verses of ephesians chapter six and then i'm going to bring to you our father's day message for this year it starts off and i like it real good i'm real pleased with the way this starts off children may i add teenagers may i add young adults obey your parents in the lord for this is right notice paul says in the lord you know they might not be in the lord they might ask you to rob a bank you're not supposed to do such a thing as that but if you've got parents in the lord you should obey them that's the word of god honor thy father and mother i like it it says which is the first commandment with promise there's no mention here of if they're worthy of it it just says to honor them you might have to be creative to honor your father or your mother on this earth but god help you and strengthen you to be that creative to be able to do that that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord how many of you believe that's really good advice would you just pray with me now lord jesus i thank you for the strength and the health and the desire to be in your house today i'm a very thankful father for the first time in over 10 days i can say by your grace that we have all of our children at home with us safe from a long journey we know lord it was your grace that brought them in even as benjamin flew in last night nearly 11 o'clock i'm so thankful that you brought them safely home it just makes my father's day a whole lot more special lord we ask today that you speak to us from your word you've made many promises for a man who seeks to please you who desires to walk upright before you you've promised blessing and provision you have given many of us the great responsibility it's also a blessing but it's a great responsibility to be a father to another life and so lord we need strength and we need help and we need encouragement and we need wisdom and lord we realize that even when they leave our home we are more limited in what we might invest but we also know that we're still needed so i pray lord that you would give daddies and granddaddies great wisdom today to know when to speak up to know when to to sow to know when they might add something even to their children and their families their grandchildren that are coming along it's a great ministry you've given us lord and i ask today that there be no condemnation in this word if there is any correction let it come from you if there's any encouragement let it come from you for lord we just stand before you as men who are flawed but as men who desire to be used by your hand we fear you because we know that you are who you say you are and you'll do what you say you will do and we want to cooperate with you in all things to raise our children in the fear of the lord give us that grace today anoint our ears to receive your word we ask for this blessing in the wonderful name of the lord jesus christ and we say amen and we ask the body the church to say so be it amen you may be seated it would not be my desire to add to anyone's grief as chad was praying today we know there are those who have lost their father and i have of course the last few days been thinking about my earthly father who passed away this year it it aches there's an ache there but as some of you also have experienced i lost him many years ago i placed him in god's hands many years ago and he's still in god's hands today but i know there are those who had real relationship with your father we thought about paul this week we spoke to him and let him know that we were thinking about him that we were praying for him that we would particularly be thinking about him today and his family as they gather together with his mom remembering the godly man that brother west was and how empty life can seem without him i wouldn't want to isolate those who have not had the privilege of being a father some we can say yet and others we realize may never have that experience in this life but god knew all that when he wrote the book and he addressed fathers and he addressed mothers knowing that everyone would not be one but i can tell you that as a as a woman of god can be a spiritual mother or a midwife to spiritual children so can a father so can a man of god he may never experience the joy of natural children but he can pour his life into somebody else's life and i'll tell you we have plenty of teachers we have plenty of tutors we have lessons by the dozens but we have a few fathers and so there's just most of us could still use a father so if you would desire to sow into somebody's life i believe there will be great fulfillment in knowing that even though you may not be working with your biological children you are at least sowing truth and encouragement and strength and i know that i know that i know who i am i know what the word has said about me but i also know that as human beings we all need to be encouraged from time to time we need to know that we're not alone in this fight and so really all of us can serve an amazing purpose we can add value to somebody somewhere if we desire to do that i'm a blessed man before i ever got out of bed this morning i was getting messages from all over the world people saying happy father's day brother shelly you're a spiritual dad to me so i spent time this morning praying lord don't let me fail those children let me continue to be encouragement to them and even more so as we as we move toward the promises of god i want to read another portion of scripture maybe a lot of scripture this morning but i want to read something king david was about to go home he was about to slip away into the presence of his creator and he left a charge for his son solomon i don't know how long it's been since you read this portion of scripture but it's been a lot of help to me this week would you give us first kings chapter two the first four verses i like the blessings that are promised in psalms 128 the first six verses i like the admonition that's given to children in ephesians six verses one through three but i am really appreciating this message this charge that david left behind now the days of david drew nigh that he should die and he charged solomon his son saying i go the way of all the earth be thou strong therefore and show thyself a man and keep the charge of the lord thy god to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his commandments and his judgments and his testimonies as it is written in the law of moses that thou mayest prosper do you want to have prosperity in your life david said solomon you want to always prosper then i want to charge you i want to charge you and encourage you to follow the lord walk in his ways keep his statutes keep his commandments keep his judgments keep his testimonies as it is written in the law of moses that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest and whithersoever thou turnest thyself that the lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me saying if thy children take heed to their way now listen david is reciting a promise that god made him in his life he is concerned that that promise not die with him he wants that promise from god to continue on to his children and his children's children i don't know there's a man in here that feels that way today but i've got a feeling that anything the lord has promised you you want to not only see that activated and in fruition in your life but you'd like to know that it would be an inherited promise that your children might be able to walk in the benefit of that and your grandchildren if jesus should tarry so david is speaking very personally to solomon solomon was the tenth son of king david he was the second son by david's wife bathsheba and he had a very close relationship with his father david he said now that the lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me saying if thy children take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart with all their soul mind will and emotions there shall not fail thee said he a man on the throne of israel this was a promise that was not just that david would have a glorious reign as king but that this kingship would pass down from generation to generation and you know that even our lord will sit on the throne of his father david and rule and reign in the millennium so this was a kingship that was so spiritual in nature that it was also a messianic promise and david said to solomon i want to make sure that you are reminded that we as a family have a promise and it's going to be for me for my children for my children's children but we have a responsibility to take heed of our ways before the lord make sure that we're walking in truth with all of our heart with all of our mind with all of our will with all of our emotions we're not allowing anything to pull us out of the promise of god we want to stay very very close to him because we want to see the fulfillment hallelujah we want to see the fulfillment of everything that he has promised i know brother branham had that desire he wanted his children to walk in the promise that god had given him he guarded them and he watched over them and he spoke publicly to encourage them and to strengthen them because he believed that one day he would lay the bible down and his sons would pick up the bible and go on and continue to do the work of the lord this was his desire and it was a noble desire you here are you in me this morning it was a noble desire and even if you say well i don't have i don't have sons well i want you to know you can have spiritual inheritance in your daughters don't worry about that brother don't let that be anything my may they continue to go on and carry on fulfilling the promises of god participating in the covenant that you have made before the lord because they're going to be a blessing to adapt to other husbands and they're going to be mothers to other generations and so i like this when i think about the fact we can't call our children for a specific calling but god can and he knew who they were and he knew who we were when he gave them to us and he didn't make any provision to give them back so we've got to do something with him he's given them to us the very first father in the bible was not a man at all he was the eternal spirit of god who created adam and eve who placed them in the garden give me ephesians 4 6 and let's see that just a moment it says one god one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all that's where fatherhood began it began in the garden of eden it began in the mind of god god himself had a desire to be a father if you'll give me christ is the mystery of god revealed paragraph 143 i want to share with you just a few things that the prophet said about god's desire to be a father he talks about fatherhood and sonhood or sonship being joined together when the word became flesh it's another level it's another layer it's another way of looking at the fact that jesus said when you've seen me you've seen the father because there he was standing there representing fatherhood and sonship all at the same time as the same person brother branham said here in paragraph 143 but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood god loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become a son a man he was not satisfied with spiritual fatherhood only he was so much of a father there were so many attributes of a father in him that the only way they could be expressed was for him to also become a man to also become a son brother branham goes on to say that's the reason jesus kept saying the son of man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now you get it and the congregation says amen see he wanted to express himself that was his one of his great threefold purposes was to express himself to identify himself with human beings to reveal his self in christ when the word became flesh fatherhood and sonship both were on display in a message calling jesus on the scene paragraph 37 brother bantam said remember in flesh he was just a man it's important to know there's great debate right now all across the theological world about his flesh was he deity in flesh and the prophet answers that question for us he was deity in a body of flesh but his flesh was the flesh of a man he said remember in flesh he was just a man but in spirit he was god but a man in flesh therefore his body was a human being that was subject to temptations subject to sicknesses and just the same as ours as he had to put on be a man a human and then he was god in the spirit he said i and my father are one my father dwelleth in me what a oneness what a union there was between the eternal spirit of the father that dwelt in him and the body of our lord the son it's pretty powerful when john baptized him on the river jordan we see god descending from heaven like a dove and the voice saying this is my beloved son in whom i am pleased to dwell powerful announcement wouldn't you say he god dwelt in christ and in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily and the father wanted to announce it to the whole world he wanted the whole world to know what is standing before you is a perfect creation hallelujah a new creation there's never been another one like him come on now there's never been another son like he's standing before you and i'm pleased to live in him i'm pleased to dwell in him i'm pleased to be identified with him it was god expressing his self through jesus and jesus was the vindication or we could say manifestation of god paragraph 40 god the father in the form of the holy spirit was in a pillar of fire and that no one could touch around him he was holy no sin offering was made just a potential offering he said now that same pillar of fire listen now that same pillar of fire the fatherhood so every time we think about the pillar of fire we can now identify the pillar of fire with fatherhood this was the demonstration of god as a father when he appeared in the pillar of fire he came down and was made god in sonship how was that in the body of our lord jesus christ can you say amen he dwelt in a pillar of fire but here he in the shekinah glory where he dwelt in a body which was his son that he created in the form of a man so that made him the son of god the second adam the new testament we know calls him the last adam he said now he had to come through the womb of a woman not like adam how many of you know adam didn't come through the womb of a woman he came here from the fingertips of god but jesus when he was revealing both fathership and sonship fatherhood and sonship he had to be born through the womb of a woman not like adam because that's what he had to condemn the birth of a human being by a woman remember we go back to the curse see so he had to come that way now that's god the son the same god and now he through offering that body without sin made a human offering so we can say that we could have never understood the fatherhood of god we could have never understood sonship as spiritual born children of the living god had it not been for the lord jesus christ not just our savior but the very demonstration of what your relationship and my relationship is to god it was demonstrated for us in the life in the body in the ministry of the lord jesus christ just one more and that's all the reading of quotes we have for today in the message questions and answers paragraph 108 he said when man was made in the image of god and then god came down in the image of man now listen first man made in the image of god adam and then god came down in the image of man jesus christ to redeem man that brought man and god together first man came in the form of god and then god came in the form of man this was the union between god and man and it was the union between fatherhood and sonship he goes on to say heavens and earth hugged and kissed each other god and man embraced each other as fatherhood and sonship when the logos became flesh and dwelt among us so i want you to see fatherhood and sonship embracing one another in this beautiful demonstration of what a son is like and what a father is like i want you to know we have a good father we have a father who went all the way on our behalf if we don't know how and we don't know what and we don't know how to carry out the role all we have to do is look to him as our example we have a good good father we have a good good papa we have so much to be thankful for i want to read acts chapter 17 verse 24 through 26. if you have your bible you might want to look there but if not it'll be up on the screen for you in just a moment acts chapter 17 verses 24 through 26 it says god that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worshipped with men's hands as though he needed anything seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things how many of you say again i got a good papa oh i've got a good daddy and had made of one blood you need to hear this all nations all races all walks of life have been made one blood of men all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation another example another demonstration of the sovereignty of god before the first man ever came to live on the earth god had already made of one blood all nations of men he had already determined the times of men appointed them before they were ever born and the bonds or bounds of their habitation every bit of this determined in the mind of god in the mind of a good god in the mind of a good father hallelujah the bible dictionary when it defines the word father it says a male parent any ancestor because we know that sometimes father in the plural fathers is meant to describe those who have gone before us it can mean god in scripture it has it can mean the creator or the originator of something it can also be a polite form of address to a superior and we don't mean the the catholic priest but we mean in certain cultures they would say and we hear more often in africa than we would perhaps in the united states a senior man or one who is going to be esteemed with some respect will be referred to as father or uncle even though there may not be any kind of blood relation between them but the term father it can be used as a as a term of respect for someone who has had experience in life when we look at the role of a father we're looking at something that is not an easy task but i'm so thankful that god gave us a perfect example the good news is that god did not just give us a pattern of perfection but he promised to help all of us who become fathers to reflect his image man's job is to trust god and to follow god and to ask god the perfect father to ask god for help in knowing how to father in knowing how to be a father in the in the revel bible dictionary which is one that i often look to it gives us biblical responsibilities of a father and i want to read a few of those and give you scriptures that are related to this concept biblically a father is to be the spiritual head of the family come on now doesn't mean we don't need our wives we need spiritual women but it's their it's not their responsibility to be the priest of the home or the spiritual head of the family can we look at exodus 12 3 i'm going to just kind of call these out quick and i know you're waiting on the computer although i hope that one is a little faster we we swapped it out i think so that it would would help a little bit in getting those scriptures pulled up exodus 12 3 it says speakee unto all the congregation of israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for a house that wasn't mama's responsibility that was an anti's responsibility that was daddy's responsibility now i want you to know it was a responsibility that had great repercussions the very safety and the survival of the children in that home depended on the father's willingness to obey the word of the lord if he didn't provide the lamb there was no lamb provided so the scripture's pretty clear it's the husband it's the father's responsibility to be the spiritual head of the family don't panic don't panic because we have a great example i'm going to say that a bunch we have a great example don't you wallow around in your feeling of insufficiency or inability we have a great example just lean on him just lean on him he'll help us he will help us job chapter 1 verse 5 and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about that job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all this was job's children job was getting up early and he was offering a burnt offering on behalf of every one of his children wouldn't that have been their place wouldn't it have been i don't know how old they were i'm not sure their age here it seems that it would have been their responsibility to make their offering to the lord but i want you to know job took his role as a priest in the home job took his role as the spiritual head of the family he took it pretty serious and he offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for jobs said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed god in their hearts thus did job continually does that do anything for anybody you know that but brother steve that verse does something for me we we can't control our children they get to a certain age we can't control them the way that we'd like to but i'll tell you what we can do we can still be a priest for them come on now we can still go before the lord on their behalf and lay the offering out and say the blood of jesus the blood of jesus over my sons the blood of jesus over my daughters the blood of jesus over my daughter-in-laws the blood of jesus over my son-in-laws hallelujah somebody said you think that do any good yes because our perfect father was also a perfect intercessor he taught us by example how to be a father he taught us by example how to be an intercessor he taught us by example how to take serious our spiritual role so i want you to know it's not just getting them here but it's and you know this is a beaut this is not this is not something to wear you out this this is something to let you know that you have a role now mama can pray and mama can fast and mama can cry out to god but i don't read here where mother is the one who laid out the offering on behalf of her children it seemed like job did it as a daddy and here was his reasoning he said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed god in their heart so i'm going to be right here doing what they may not be doing on their own behalf what good does it do i tell you it moves angels in their direction it shifts the heavens over their head you don't ever have to give up i don't care how far they go i don't care what they land in i don't care how they hate what you love you can go before god as a spiritual intercessor and say i'm claiming them brother branham told us we have every right to claim our children as children of god as sons of god and i i think i think this is a pretty powerful demonstration that we see in the life of job the bible also tells us that the father with the help of his wife was to oversee the education of their children i appreciated something that was said in the graduation the other night by one of the by either abby or zoe i i think it was and they mentioned the fact that their dad was there with their mom in their education they were co-teachers in the sense that they partnered together for the education of their children the kids noticed it and they brought our attention to it and this is the biblical example this is the biblical way it's not just to leave a mother on our own to try to figure it all out according to the bible it's also our responsibility as fathers to help oversee to help make sure you say well i do my part i buy it well i want you to know your your advice your leadership your intelligence is needed in other ways than just the investment of your pocketbook right and i thought wow here it was just called out for all of us to see what an example of how it's supposed to operate the bible tells us in deuteronomy 6 verses 4 through 9 hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart with all thy soul with all thy might and these words which i command me this command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shall teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house and on thy gates again this is the role of a spiritual priest as the spiritual head of the home we are assisting in their natural education and as fathers we are responsible to provide that spiritual education that they need and here's the way it's done not by sending them off to school [Applause] you know you look at the hour we're living in now and you just wonder in your mind what is in a parent's head to send their kid down to egypt to be trained for life i want you to know everything and anything you can imagine is down there in egypt hanging around the schoolhouse god never intended for education to be institutionalized there's not one scripture in the bible that speaks like that but every scripture tells us it's our responsibility as parents to teach them the things they need to know somebody said i'm so afraid i don't know everything i need to know to pass on to my children let me tell you something you do what god commands you to do and you believe that god will help you and direct you and place for you uh the right curriculum the right structure that you need you'll be all right you'll be all right oh don't let it get quiet you'll be all right homeschool children are some of the highest ranking children educationally in the entire united states our universities are very very happy to stamp them up and that's something you should also think about long and hard because we're finding out that universities are equipped to take out of our children in four years what we have put in them in 12. so it's something to think about there's god's got a plan don't you worry god's got a plan he's got a way for you to do it so that it doesn't have that negative effect who would have ever thought education would come right to our houses and that's where it is right now did you know the biggest a very big percentage of of uh gra excuse me of 2021 graduates a big percentage of 2021 graduates in the united states are already enrolled in colleges and will never have to leave their living room we will have the highest number of recent graduates enrolled in freshman year of university who will never have to leave their living room god makes a way he'll make a way he'll make a way if we trust him don't get quiet he'll make a way and then proverbs 22 and 6 tells us train up a child and that's not just telling them what to do how many of you know training is a whole lot more than just telling them what to do you take an animal i don't mean your children or animals well i don't want to make you mad the analogy that was used here in deuteronomy is an analogy that's used for the animal if you were to go to amish country today you would see an example of this binding with frontlets for their eyes because you'll often see the amish horses pulling the amish buggies and many many times you'll see frontlets on the eyes of those horses blinders they call them to help keep out the distraction and hopefully keep the horse from being spooked and running dangerously into a ditch and they still have to deal with the ignorance of people honking their horns and pulling too close to the vehicles and so forth and that's why we read every year that there are precious amish people who lose their lives in buggy wrecks and things and a lot of them have to do with the fact that people are not respectful of someone trying to do it a different way but this is part of the concept and training is not just telling them what to do training is showing them consequences when we're training dogs not to make a mess in the house we reward them when they obey it's positive reinforcement that makes an amazing difference in getting an animal to behave properly it's called training the word that's used here is not just telling the child it's training the child lots of positive reinforcements and on the occasion that too proverbs 13 24 in the amplified he who spares his rod the rod of discipline hates his son but he who loves him disciplines diligently and punishes him early now how many of you believe that's right it is right how do we know because we have an example we have training that's in that's involved in our spiritual relationship with our father this concept of discipline when necessary shall i read it hebrews 12 beginning in verse 5 and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if he endure the if he endure chastening god dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are you bastards and not sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and lie and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness what a promise now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yielded the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby remember this perfect example that we have of god being a father to us it's not just the positive reinforcement but it's also the reminder that there's a consequence for making a bad choice i think children are amazing i think even small little babies are amazing and i think we underestimate what they're able to understand because we don't think they can understand i don't know if i'll get in trouble or not i don't think it's likely but uh just recently we were sitting out here at a volleyball game ezekiel was in my lap and he kept going for my glasses i had my glasses in my pocket and he kept going for my glasses and i said no no no you know try to distract him he's just little not a year old just try to distract him so that he wouldn't keep reaching for them but i want you to know they got longer memories than their parents he remembered well he'd go 10 minutes to do something else and then all of a sudden spin around and go for those glasses no i didn't spank him he wasn't mind to spank that doesn't mean i wouldn't do it but i didn't do it but i'll tell you what i did do i took his little hand as he reached up there for the glasses i took my one finger i never swatted him i never struck him i just took my one finger i never even thumped him i just took my finger and did like that on his just that gentle i don't believe you did i did because i didn't know who was looking did it just that gentle and i looked him right in the eye and i said no oh he didn't know what you were saying then why in the world did he twist up his face he twisted his face in the most awful thing you have crushed my feelings and it was in that moment zach that i realized he knows exactly that he i'm sure he's heard no before i'm sure that mother and dad are already telling him no they better but i didn't know how much he understood but just that no and the look on his face not you too that's how he looked not you too surely not you you're not gonna be one of them too are you i realize he's at the perfect age not to be just told what to do but to be shown what to do the bible said this is part of a dad's responsibility to train a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it and i want you to know that many of you have done an amazing job in doing that if you have if you have uh you know sometimes dads who feel a little bit slighted in life and want so much to be loved and respected by their children sometimes they slack off or pull back withdraw a little bit from the area of discipline because they want to be the popular they want to be the accepted they want to be the cool you understand and and it's circumstances that kind of put them in that position but i want you to know you'll never be sorry you will never be sorry that you did your part in training your children you'll be able to stand out and watch them in a crowd and know that it might not have been popular it might not have made you feel as good as you needed to feel but now watching them and how they conduct themselves there's a lot of joy in that can you say amen the bible said it's a father's responsibility to provide for the needs of his family we talked about the spiritual needs and the areas of education but the bible talks about to be a provider for the family that's what the scripture said it's our responsibility you know we i know that uh the way that people live today it almost requires two incomes three incomes but this isn't the way god designed it in the beginning will anybody help me this isn't the way god intended for it to be in the beginning especially when the children start coming they need that constant daily attention that constant daily presence of the mama in their life i know a lot of men have worked two jobs their fingers to the bone because they wanted a wife who could be home with their children god bless you god bless you the bible said in proverbs 6 6 through 11 that we should consider the ant the bible goes on to say in verse 10 of 6 yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep and so shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth and thy want as an armed man this is one of the most serious scriptures concerning a man's responsibility to provide for his own and i only read this so that every child and every teenager every young adult in this church will be able to be thankful because we have providers in our life come on say amen come on mama we have men who take providing for their children for their wives for their families very very serious first timothy 5 8 says but if any provide not for his own and especially for those of his own house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel and that's a heathen that doesn't acknowledge god it's our responsibility when we're tired when we're not tired when i hear about these young men i say i do say they're young i thank god that they have the youth to do it but i also recognize that their responsibility is great and when i hear about these young married daddies who have to sometimes report to work at three o'clock in the morning or work every saturday and the only day they get off is sunday and they spend a great portion of it here in the house of god i think about it i think about the fact that we're blessed to have men like that in our church and we're blessed like that our kids are blessed the ones that we love the kids and grandkids around here we can say how blessed they are to have a dad who is willing and you know to me it doesn't matter if it's all by his hands if it's by carpentry work or it's all by physical labor i don't care what color his collar is it doesn't matter whether it's blue collar white collar the bible doesn't say that one is to be honored or respected more than the other it's just the need should be met and it's a dad's responsibility to make sure that our children are provided for i'm going to tell you the best way i know how to address birth control don't dare have any more than you can provide for you're not doing anybody a service just a minute amen brother shelly amen we're not just having them for the government to take care of no no no no no no we're having them because we want to raise them up in the fear of god but we want to provide for their needs along the way can you say amen i'm not going to read this long portion of scripture because i need to hurry but in deuteronomy chapter 22 verses 13 through 19 just jot it down you'll find out that in a court of law it was a father's responsibility to stand up for the rights of their daughters particularly their daughters there are other verses of scripture in deuteronomy that we could read and apply to sons but particularly deuteronomy 22 speaks about a woman being mistreated by her husband because he questions her virginity at the time of their marriage and uh she is not just guilty because he says she is but the bible tells us that that girl's father may go and stand up for her in the court system of the land we know as we study the message of the hour for instance the prophet has told us by the scripture and i know we're streaming but we've been told by the scripture that engagement is a very serious thing we're not a people who believe in dating around we're people who believe that courtship is the right way and courtship is not to try on somebody for size it's to know now mistakes can be made no doubt about it and people can think that they have found the one that god has chosen for them and it not be the case and also the enemy can get involved and do lots of damage because that's what he seeks to do he's the thief and he comes to steal and to kill and to destroy but a father has a very specific and important role when it comes to courtship for his children there's no doubt about it and he also has authority in the scripture to cancel an engagement you would have to be raising children who respected your opinion but i know many times in some very serious situations that i'm aware of in other places where there were perhaps levels of dishonesty and young people find themselves engaged without the proper methods involved i think it's a wonderful thing to have the permission of your mother and father both both parties don't you i just wouldn't want to start out on the road of marriage in 2021 knowing that my parents were against it well how could you ever change you might not be able to but i believe that god is able he's certainly able to help their hearts if you're really doing the right thing but i know of situations where fathers have had to step in and say i have serious serious problems and serious concerns and i'm going to have to cancel this and because this is an agreement that in bible days an engagement could only be broken with a divorce not just a marriage but also an engagement so the father has the role a serious role of being involved i've even had young girls say to me after having broken homes i sure wish somebody would have stood up for me and i pray i believe i believe i believe [Laughter] i'm not going to make i was going to kind of make a comment about uh how many weapons are represented by brothers in our church they seem to own quite a collection of them and that might be something to remind a an old boy somewhere if you had to you know [Applause] we wouldn't even know how to begin men we wouldn't even know how to begin had it not been for our example god is a father who loves his children so much he died in their place romans 5 8 put it up for me would you romans 5 8 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us what a father can somebody say what a father the bible said he's the father who delights in giving wonderful things to his children that's our example that's the example that we have james 1 17 in the amplified bible says every good gift and every perfect free large full gift is from above it comes down from the father of all that gives light in the shining of whom there can be no variation rising or setting or shadow cast by his turning as in an eclipse he gives good gifts and perfect gifts freely to his children so we have no excuse not to know how we have a great example we have a father who loves his children the same somebody said what about election you understand how election came romans 2 11 in the amplified bible said for god shows no partiality undue favor or unfairness with him one man is not different from another that's our example we can't have favorites he's a father who loves to talk to his children more than 1200 times in the bible it says these words god said thus sayeth the lord the lord said god saith jesus said unto them or the word of god declares 1200 times in the bible we have a god who knows how to speak to his children and how to communicate to his children and children need to hear from their dad well mama does all the talking you just uh get your turn children need to hear from their daddy don't you allow the enemy to cause you to feel intimidated like you don't have anything to bring god knows who you are he knows your talents he knows your weaknesses he knew that when he gave you children so let them hear your voice our papa our father wants us to hear from him god our daddy gives us rules and he tells us that there are consequences of breaking those rules the consequences are always exactly what he said they would be anybody ever found out it's easier to threat than to carry out god's a better example than that he told them exactly in genesis 2 verses 15 through 17 exactly how life was to be carried out in the garden exactly what should be partaken of and what should not be and when they did exactly the opposite of what god told them to do in genesis 3 verses 9 through 24 god did exactly what he said he would do if they didn't obey him how many of you believe daddies have got to be consistent we have to be consistent because we have an example who tells us what is right what is wrong and then tells us the price that we're going to pay proverbs 3 verses 11 and 12 and i'm nearly done my son despise not the chastening of the lord neither be weary of his correction for whom the lord loveth he correcteth even as a father the son in whom he delighteth it's not always easy but it's part of the training process one day your voice is going to be silenced one day your presence is not going to be known we have to do what we can while we can and being consistent is so very important we have a father who never gives up on his children he continues to love us no matter what we do how many of you know not just mamas can love unconditionally we've had a great example hosea 11 and 4. if you'll put that up for me jose 11 and 4. i drew them this is amplified sorry this is amplified i drew them with cords of a man with bands of love and i was to them as one who lives up and eases the yoke over their cheeks and i bent down to them and gently laid food before them this is the father's love for even the rebellious child i drew them with cords of a man with bands of love and i was to them as one who lifts up and eases the yoke over their cheeks and i bent down to them and gently laid food before them it's one thing for us to say let them find out for their self it's another thing for us to take the responsibility that god gave us in the beginning and love them regardless of how they disappoint us romans 11 28 also in the amplified i like to read this i'd like for you to hear this one too from the point of view of the gospel good news they the jews at present are enemies of god the apostle is saying if you look at the jews right now second temple period they are enemies of god which is for your advantage and benefit but from the point of view of god's choice of election of divine selection they are still the beloved dear to him for the sake of their forefathers if you can understand this you can understand the conditional love of a parent it looks like the jews were doing everything they could to stop the coming of the messiah while praying for him to come it seems as though they have made themselves the enemies of god this is how you see them paul said this is how they appear to us but if we could see the heart of their father we would know that in his view they are still his chosen they are still his select they are still his beloved oh what an example we have of what a father is now our father loves us but he's made a plan to save us to deliver us from our mistakes and from our sins revelation 21 verses one through seven this is our inheritance and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men he will dwell with them they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new does this sound good to anybody yet and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of the water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son our father has made a way for our salvation for our deliverance and he has laid an inheritance aside with our name on it he is a papa he's a father who keeps his promises when always every time give a second peter 1 4 king james no amplified forgive me i forgot to identify it as amplified but i can recognize it because of all the parentheses by means of these he has bestowed on us his precious and exceedingly great promises so that through them you may escape by flight from the moral decay rottenness and corruption that is in the world because of covetousness lust and greed and become sharers partakers of the divine nature he keeps his promises they're precious and exceedingly great and he is faithful to keep every one of them he never lies he never lies to his children we have an example every father in this church we have an example of what a father is one of those examples he never lies numbers 23 19 amplified god is not a man that he should tell or act a lie neither the son of man that he should feel repentance or compassion for what he excuse me compunction for what he has promised has he said and shall he not do it or has he spoken and shall he not make it good oh no if he said it if he said it that settles it if you believe that same man i want to read you one more scripture jeremiah 31 1-3 at the same time saith the lord will i be the god of all the families of israel and they shall be my people thus saith the lord the people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness even israel when i went to cause him to rest the lord hath appeared of old unto me saying yea i have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with lovingkindness have i drawn thee that's the example that we have of what the father is we can follow his example because we can't say we can say in the natural maybe i i didn't have a father to show me how i know what that feels like i felt the same but when we meditate on our father you know i have always liked to talk about that word abba it it doesn't mean daddy sometimes we translate it that way it's it's a stronger term of endearment than daddy it would be like papa but maybe when you say daddy you say it with the same kind of endearment i looked at that word this week a little more carefully and i found out that there is even a deeper meaning it is a term of intimacy but it is also a pledge of obedience when we call him papa when we call him abba as is mentioned several times in the bible we're saying we see you as our father as our dear father our papa our example but if we should call god the god of eternity a term like that and we should use abba for the full meaning of the word in aramaic it actually means you are my papa and my desire is to please you i think every son every daughter has experienced that in the natural the desire to please a parent but in the spiritual when we should call him papa or abba we're not just saying i want to have an intimate relationship with you but we're also saying i want to obey you even the nod of your head even the turn of your eye i want to please you in all things how many of you that's your desire you want to please our heavenly father i'm so thankful today for godly men in this house i'm so thankful that they're not failing their families but they are rock solid if there is any shadow of turning in us then we come to our papa we come to our father and we say lord strengthen my legs strengthen my heart strengthen my walk with you give me grace to surrender more of who i am to more of who you'd have me be it is not god's will for you to condemn yourself and your role as a father it's god's will for you if you recognize that you should be slack and we all are in some way or another we have been and when we recognize that we are we just come to our papa we just come to our father and we say lord teach me how to do a better job the next time how many of you believe he will it's a great responsibility but it's one of the most wonderful blessings and privileges that you could ever have in this life brother i don't mean to keep talking about uh the graduation but it's good to talk about but i mentioned to brother kerry here on the platform after the service how much i enjoyed the song and he communicated to me what it's like for him to see them using their all of them not just the graduates but using their talent for the lord and how much he enjoys being a part of that and uh we all know what that feels like as a parent you know brother branham uh we've heard the testimony of i'm just going to say our brother because i think he got in a little bit of trouble for sharing his testimony he saw how there were some people who mistreated brother branham's children and there were others who nearly worshiped them and he saw that they were going to have a real confused life so he was a friend to them and he was there to remind them of their humanity you ever have a friend like that one who is there to remind you of your humanity and he would observe a well-meaning saints who wanted to obey what brother branham said brother branham said if you want to do something nice for me do something nice for my children every parent every mother every father understands that i think any parent in here has the potential of being a bear when people keep putting their hands on their children so brother branham just said you want to do something nice for me just do something nice for my children and what he meant was pray for them and treat them with love and respect and and and be good to them as you can but he didn't mean support them particularly that was his job and this friend of ours he would often see people just handing them money and he wanted them to understand that's not all all the way it's going to be in life it might be fun for them to do that now and they feel good about themselves because they're doing what brother branham asked him to do but handing handing little little kids who didn't know any responsibility hundred-dollar bills because their daddy was a prophet that could be a dangerous thing couldn't it and so this friend of mine he he said i always wanted to show them how to earn earn little money and so he would take one of the sons around and and help him to get odd jobs painting fences and cleaning up yards and then he could feel real good about that money that he had earned i'd say that friend was doing exactly what brother branham was saying you love me do something nice for my children that's what he was doing he didn't want them to be set up with some kind of false life he wanted them to know my they had their share of criticism because the children of any leader are going to have lots of criticism it's always easy for people who don't live the life they live to criticize but they have to learn like all the rest there's a balance there's a balance in life you don't get uh privileges because of who you're related to you have to earn your way you have to show respect you have to do what is right you have to learn sometimes the hard way i want to just say to every daddy here i'm blessed to know you i mean that i'm blessed to know you your children are blessed to have you i look around and i see those who haven't had that blessing yet and i i look forward to i'll just be honest i look forward to some of these young men like josh and different ones david's fixing to get married and michael christians fixing getting married i look forward to the to the day that they get to enjoy what it means to be a dad i look forward to being the one that gets to do like that and love on them we're blessed in this house would you stand let's come musicians i know i don't do good bringing a message on a special day like this i i just unless i read it i i'm just too scattered but i did the best i could this morning and i meant every word of it and i i feel like we are a really blessed people we're very blessed we're very very blessed i asked benjamin if he would lead us this morning when we got up i asked if he would lead us in what a good good father we have and my we do let's stand oh we're standing already let's worship him he's worthy i pray that in the rest of your day you will enjoy your children no matter how old they are that you'll look back i love watching brother richard watch his kids i do he talked about it the graduation all the things he would like to have said but his emotions wouldn't have let him said it all and you know what i told him i said you spoke volumes by saying nothing the look on your face those tears running down your cheeks that showed everybody in the room how thankful you were to god or the children and grandchildren that you're blessed with sometimes words are just not necessary can you say amen let's worship god let's worship our papa oh what a good father i have he's never failed me he's always been there when i needed him he's kept every promise hallelujah and i have no reason to believe he'll ever change he's the same yesterday and today and forever who i've heard a thousand stories of what they think you're lying but i've heard a tender whisper of love in the dead of night and you tell me that you're pleasing that i am never alone you're a good good father it's who you are it's who you are it's who you are i'm loved by you it's who i am it's who i am it's who i am oh i sing many searching for answers [Music] you are

and stand here just a moment we're going to pray over you as a as a group of godly men we're going to ask your families to come stand behind you and some will be here without their family brother david manns his wife is out visiting the vanden langenbergs and i know a lot of us appreciate brother david would you all ask families you'll have to spread out a little bit so your family can get around you but would you all just come and let's lay hands i mean i mean sincerely let's put our hands on these men maybe they mean something to you just in a spiritual way and you just like to stand with them in that regard but would you just come and lay your hand on them ask god to strengthen their going to encourage them when they when they feel uh insufficient or they get a little overwhelmed with all the pulls and pressures of life and as a congregation we want to support them we know their family standing with them and supporting them is the most important for them but we also know that having the body of christ behind us is helping us so much to go forward and to be what god has called us to be i want us to sing again just a little bit more of that and then we're just going to pray over these men that god will use them lord let this be the greatest year of their life for you let us hallelujah sing it to him it's who you are [Music] [Music] yes is [Music] [Music] i'm gonna ask you just to pray for these men of god these daddies that stand here i'm going to just ask you to lift your voice and ask that the lord would strengthen them and bless them and help them in this way pray right now would you church hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah lord there's so much in society that minimalizes the role of a man in his own home as a father it seems that hollywood and all of the influences that be like to dumb down the role of a dad but we recognize the importance of that spiritual priest in every home and we pray for the men of god that are standing before this congregation those who may be streaming this service in various forms we pray right now that the strength of the lord would be upon them we pray right now that you would minister oh god to their needs that you would give them wisdom help them to understand their vital role their significance in the family oh god we lift them up right now i hope you're taking this serious we lift them up right now because we understand that a lot of the enemies weapons are trained on them how the enemy would like to discourage them caused him to stumble but we pray right now that he will not be successful that the power and might of the holy ghost will be upon these men of god that they will have divine leadership that only comes from you lord [Music] that they will feel valued that they will feel honored and respected in their home and in this church as a body that they matter their thoughts matter and their feelings matter oh god give them wisdom that is not of this world leadership that is not of this
