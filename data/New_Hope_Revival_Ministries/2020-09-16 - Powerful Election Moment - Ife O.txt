TRANSCRIPT
========================================
even the spirit of laodicea would not be able to destroy you you are chosen for the job you were chosen for this age you were chosen for this generation and that's a powerful election it means that god knowing everything there was to know about you knew your way would be hard he knew you would have many obstacles he knew you would have many shortcomings weaknesses failures sin he knew that you would fight many battles climb many mountains swim many rivers but at the end of you he knew that even the spirit of the age even the spirit of laodicea would not be able to destroy you he saw that even in the most evil of all the ages you would potentially overcome that's powerful you talk about a cheerleader you talk about somebody cheering you on you not only have the great cloud of witnesses hebrews 11 and 12 but you also have the greatest cheerleader that there ever has been you have the eternal spirit of god shaking a pom-pom on your behalf how do i know that because he placed you in laodicea when he gets stirred up on the inside and he begins to fall on this body of flesh you may find yourself doing something in the natural you would have never thought possible you may find yourself out running ahab's chariot you may find yourself slaying a giant with a slingshot you may find yourself dancing in the spirit like a wild man drunk on new wine you might find yourself shouting at the top of your voice forgetting about who you are and your reputation you've tried to maintain is a rock solid something i don't know what when that flesh and listen we talk about the flesh like it's the enemy it's not the enemy it just needs to get under the anointing and there's a bride in the last days that are going to have an anointing that doesn't fall and leave and fall and leave and fall and leave on their flesh but as they continue to surrender to the living word even their flesh receives a portion of the spirit of god that empowers them to function in a different way than those around them
