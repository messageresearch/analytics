TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] you [Music] you [Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to the program today and I hope you've been following this series thus far this will be program number four and we are studying together the process of spiritual adoption and we're finding out in the scripture that God is calling his people in this hour to that place of relationship to that place of adoption and we're just barely scratching the surface thus far but we're going to share at least we have gotten out of our first scripture reference it took us three programs to get out of Romans 8 and so now we're going to move into Ephesians in just a moment but I pray that the Lord will speak to you from his word why don't you take some time to contact our ministry the information for contact us is available there on your screen we would love to hear from you we would love to know that you're watching the program and that it's been a blessing to you we would be more than happy to join in prayer with you over your prayer requests if you would so desire to send them in and we're also available to celebrate with you when God answers prayer and it's always an exciting thing to have a need and present it to the Lord and lay your petition before him and then stand back and watch God move and I think we said on the last program God doesn't always move when we want him to move or in the way that we want him to move but because he's sovereign he works all things out for our good that was part of our scripture reading last time we were together that all things work together for the good of those who are the called of the Lord those who are called according to his purpose so we're going to get right into the study today and I pray that you will just catch up with us if you happen to miss a program and let's just get in and see what the Lord will show us from his word today a man we're going to read this week from Ephesians chapter one and it also has of the truths that I love so dearly from Romans 8 and we are talking about adoption and I'm starting off the series by reading to you all of the places in the New Testament where the word adoption is mentioned and we said at the end of the program last week that the word adoption is actually made up of two Greek words one of those words is pulse which means a mature son and the other is a Greek word that is thesis and it means placement and so when we read the word adoption in the Bible we know that that word really means the placing of a mature son and God is calling his children to maturity in this hour and you know i'm thinking of scriptures that talk about being children tossed to and fro and children who are sitting in the marketplace is saying i piped unto you and you didn't dance or other scriptures that talk about the people sitting down to eat and instead of eating they rose up to play and we've all made foolish mistakes like that in our Christian walk and but but God is calling us in this hour to come to a place of maturity and maturity is Authority and when we start walking in maturity and in the wisdom of the Lord that comes in maturity or with maturity then we can start focusing very carefully and specifically on the destiny that God has planned for our lives and we can quit talking about it and do it aren't you ready to just start doing what God has called you to do so we're going to start reading in Ephesians chapter 1 and we're going to begin with verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ and we can testify that as children of God followers of Yeshua the Messiah that we have been truly blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in mushy OCH verse 4 according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world do you recognize that as a part of the Bride of Christ as a part of that overcoming company of believers that you were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world the Bible talks about in the book of the revelation these are they whose names were found written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world how could that be possible well we read that in Romans chapter 8 how that by God's foreknowledge you say to me pastor did I have a choice was it my choice was it an act of my free will to accept the Lord Jesus Christ as my savior of course it was an act of your will but because God is omniscient he knew he has all knowledge he knew your choice before you were ever born that's the God that we serve one of the reasons why I like to speak on that so often it's because it gives me some peace it causes me to be able to relax and trust and know that if God knew my choice would be to serve him before I was ever born in fact before the world was ever framed and the foundations of the earth were ever laid then no matter what happens to me in my life today I can relax and say God you've got it under control if you knew everything that was going to happen in my life before the world was framed then I have nothing to worry about if I can learn to lean heavily on you and trust you then everything's going to be all right you're going to take care of me and so we understand that when we eventually are born and we come into our life and we make that choice to follow the Lord Jesus Christ we used to sing a song that said my name was written down there's a new name written down in glory because I got saved and we understand from the scripture that's not the way it was at all these are they whose names were found written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world how could God do that again he did it because he had foreknowledge of our decision before we were ever born and now this scripture tells us that he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy holy sanctified set apart in in really researching the word holy and holiness and studying it all the way through the scriptures lately a very simple definition of holy is above ordinary something that God has set apart for His divine purposes above average above ordinary somebody said well that that just doesn't seem to make it big enough well what I want to do by using that definition is to help you see that God has chosen you to live a life that is above average we're not survivors you know in America there's a popular so-called reality television program called survivor and it's about people who get put on an island and and they try to see who can stay there the longest without voting each other off and they go through different tests and obstacles and so forth to see who ultimately will be the number one survivor well I want to tell you something that's how people who have no hope live they hope to be the one who can survive but we are not called as the Bride of Christ to be survivors we have been called as a part of the Bride of Christ to be overcomers to overcome to to live a life in which we would not be overcome by evil by the wicked influences of this life and of the world and of society and of sin but that we would overcome evil with good so let me tell you something brother sister you're not called just to be a survivor jesus said in John 10 I've come that you might have life that's good and that you might have it more abundantly that's the difference between a survivor is one who has life but a overcomer is one who has life more abundantly the abundant life of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's what we have been called for is to overcome so we're just thankful I'm just so thankful for what God has done and when he says I've called you and predestinated you to be holy to be set apart not to function in the same way that others function who have no Savior who have no hope who have no salvation through Jesus Christ they just barely get by and it you've heard the expression may be dog-eat-dog meaning i'll walk over whoever i have to walk over to get to the top but that's not how the holy of the Lord the redeemed of the Lord the sanctified of the Lord that's not how we live our lives we live our lives set apart above ordinary above average sanctified pure asking God daily that our flesh would be crucified that our motives would be examined you know we're seeing after all these years of serving the Lord that it's all about our motive god is looking deeper than our behavior and our actions he sees that he certainly does know what we do and how we live how we behave but man sees the outward appearance man sees the behavior pattern man sees the the overflow of who we are on the inside but God sees first who we are on the inside man has no right to judge another man's motives but God who sees the heart automatically knows your motive the intent of your heart what you really mean when you say something what you really mean when you do something and so we are a daily coming to the Lord we must and say father helped me with my motive let there be no selfish ambition in me let my my whole reason for living be to glorify your name to help instruct others and to equip others and to testify to others of what you have done in my own life and there's no period on the end of that sentence what you have done it's really what you're still doing god is still working on us we're even after years some of us have served the Lord I have spent more years of my life serving the Lord than not serving the Lord and yet i'm still a work in progress i'm not a finished product God is still dealing with me and amazingly a little bit backwards for me is the way it happened because I grew up in a in a church environment where we there was much emphasis on on behavior and and how you were observed by others and what you did and where you went and so forth and I think these things are very very important but you can line all of that up and still have a heart jesus said you can have the you can be like a whited Sepulcher you can be a beautiful tomb on the outside but inside you can be full of dead men's bones and so that's kind of why I think my I experienced was a little bit backward because I was able to get the outside and at least the appearance and and my demeanor behavior lined up but there were still things in my heart that God had to deal with and he's still dealing with them my motive and and these these deep things you know that we carry because of maybe what we've been through or because of relationships or rejection or whatever and so I celebrate the fact today that I am not what I am going to be but I'm surely not what I used to be and why is that it's because of the grace of the lord jesus christ and i asked him for the same grace in your life and if you're willing to accept the price that he paid for you on calvary you can start your journey with him right now and because the days are short because we're living in the end time there will be a measure of acceleration where many people are going to begin to walk in mature truths of the of the word that they have not had the life experience to get to but they've received it supernaturally and that's part of the importance of satellite television because God is bringing truths right into your home that you might not ever for instance this program i'm not saying only this program i'm just saying one of many but you may never come to see me in alabama and I may never be able to come to see you where you are but perhaps there's a little something that we're carrying that God has deposited in our lives that he wants you to be a partaker of and so look look what's happening I'm sitting here and behind a little desk in the sanctuary of my church in Alabama and you're watching me on the other side of the world so that's the grace of God and I love that about the Lord and he knows when we pray over these programs we say Lord we don't know who's going to be watching but you do so you speak what you would have spoken so verse 5 again says having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved now that's good good news and it's a good word in whom we have redemption through his blood now what the blood of lambs and goats and bulls could not do God sending his own son in the form of sinful flesh in the form of flesh in the form of man although he was free from sin and without sin he came in a body of flesh and he paid the price he shed his blood he became our substitute our propitiation he became our sacrifice our Paschal Lamb our Passover lamb Messiah Yeshua that's what he became on my behalf he paid for my sins now talk about love the Bible said no greater love hath any man than this that he would lay down his life as a sacrifice for sin Jesus helped us to understand you're not taking my life I'm giving my life it wasn't the Roman soldiers that took his life he gave his life as a sacrifice so that you and I might be redeemed to God I praise the Lord for that in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace you would never be able to withdraw all the riches of the grace of god he is so rich in mercy and so full of grace for those who will ask for those who need him and I'm needy and I'm I'm willing and ready to admit that I'm needy i need the Lord's grace I need his mercy I need his help not on a weekly basis either on a daily basis and sometimes every hour on the hour I need him and he tells me that I can come to him when I need him he said cast all of your case all of your cares on me because I care for you because I want to help you carry your burdens and he has he's been faithful to do that now look at verse 8 wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence now that word prudence in the original is understanding God wants to give us wisdom and understanding he wants to release to us impart to us wisdom and understanding verse 9 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times now I believe that's the dispensation that we're living in we've talked about this on other series that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him a joining together a synergy that's taking place between all the things that are in heaven and all the saints that are on the earth a divine union in Christ that's part of the adoption process that God is revealing to us by the spirit verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will you know what that's saying again relax take a deep breath God is going to work out his perfect will in your life if you quit resisting and surrender he's going to have his way he's waiting on us remember what what Yeshua said to show to Saul on the road to Damascus it's hard for you to kick against the pricks why don't you surrender is what he was saying instead of resisting me receive me and you know we have a lot of extra problems in our life because we resist the will of God if you and I could come to the place today where we quit resisting the will of God because it's not what we want or what we think we're good at or what we think we qualify for or what we're worthy of are capable of I mean listen I have had to come to a place where I have said to the Lord I I'm not much good you know really at all I'm not extremely good at anything I would almost call myself a jack of all trades but that's very very poor too because I can't fix anything and that's usually what you think about when you say that but what I mean is the rest of that phrase says a jack of all trades and a master of none and that that's the part that I am a master of none I can do you know a few things several things pretty good but with the grace of God and by the help of the Lord he takes what I have what he's given me is what abilities given me and he can use that in a mighty way as long as I don't resist his will and I start saying but I can't do it I don't tell the Lord that anymore I don't tell the Lord I can't what I say to the Lord is if you've called me if you're the one that's called me this is on you you've got to help me and I don't say that with disrespect I say that because he's my abba father I have that kind of a relationship with him that I can say Lord I will I will you want me to go I'll go but I cannot go like Moses said I cannot go without your presence I cannot go without your glory I cannot go without your help there was a time in my life that I would have said I cannot go I can't do that I'm not capable I'm not worthy i'm not smart enough I'm not good enough but now I say I can't go unless you go with me and that's where God wants to bring all of us in this hour to a place of true obedience to his will and submission and surrender to the divine purposes of God in your life and once you allow him to have his way and let him help you to accomplish through you what he has called you for then all you have to do is rest rest rest in him rest in his were dressed in his promise anyway i could go on in that i'm thinking of a lot of other things but i think i probably should try at least to stay with this but it's just good to be at rest it's good to have peace jesus said I've come to give you peace not not the kind of peace the world gives you either because that's not enough the kind of peace that I have it passes all human understanding and endures forever that is the piece that is the Shalom of Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ no doubt about it in whom also we have obtained an inheritance verse 11 being predestinated according to the purpose of him who work at all things after the counsel of his own will not my will Lord your will be done that we should be to the praise and the glory to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory there's that earnest we talked about enrollments ate the first fruits of his spirit and now we're talking about the earnest of his spirit saying to us that the born-again experience including the baptism of the Holy Spirit is only the token it is of course the greatest work of mercy and grace that the world has ever known but so many of us have came well in fact many of us came to be justified and we said I've arrived whole denominations of the world only teach justification to be saved to join the church to have forgiveness of sins and that was the beginning Martin Luther did a lot of teaching on justification the just shall live by faith and then God raised up the Wesley brothers and there was a lot of teaching on the next step of our the next installment of the new birth and that is to be sanctified to be set apart to let the Spirit of God the Word of God Wash U and cleanse you inside and to correct your behavior and your attitudes and and to deliver you from jealousies and resentments and insecurities and so forth and then in the in the dawning of the new Pentecostal day in late 1800s and early 1900s we began to see the restoration of the gifts and the pouring out of the Holy Spirit something that hadn't hadn't been well known in hundreds and hundreds of years and and it's amazing that there are major groups of people that have gone to one step and stopped and said there's no more and others said wait a minute there's more to than just being justified I'm going to be sanctified by the washing of the water the word and then many stopped there but some said no no no I'm going up to Pentecost I'm going to receive the restoration of the gifts in the baptism of the Holy Spirit unfortunately many stopped there and that is only the earnest the firstfruits of the Spirit the beginning of what God wants to do in our lives so what we've been teaching on this process of spiritual adoption is the rest of what God wants to do he wants to bring us to a place of full adoption where he fully occupies our life and I'm gonna contend I'm gonna push I'm gonna pray I'm going to press and I'm going to believe God to see that manifested in my own life and I have a burden for you that you would see it manifested in your life well don't ever stop and sab got all of god I need there's so much more so much more I can't believe my time is gone I feel like I just started but I'm going to pray that God will speak to your heart that he'll make his word real to you right now father would you speak to men and women's hearts would you quicken your word and make it live and alive in them and father let these truths pull to them and call to them the deep calling to the deep and give each one a desire to search these things through the scripture and see if they'd be so release your healing virtue in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua we pray amen and amen thank you for watching the eagles cried don't forget to tune in again next week for the next part I guess it'll be part 5 I'm already thinking how many parts are there going to be a lot I'd say but thank you for watching and i hope you will tune in again next time bye bye for now [Music] you [Music] you
