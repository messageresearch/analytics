Jesus Yeshua our Messiah and King he's worthy to be praised we are making it through the coldest snap in about 10 years and God is good to us he's helping us perhaps you heard that there were a couple of uh spews on the campground yesterday and we're thankful that the brothers were able there were enough brothers who were able to get here and uh you know I I was really touched because the way that people reacted and got in and got it done and taken care of and got along while doing it and there were those who offered to run errands to pick up supplies and even even Jason's sister Flo's grandson texted me and he said brother Shelley I saw that there was a leak on the campground I can leave now coming to help fix fix it and I said Jason I believe there's enough people that have committed back to us that they're going to be able Matthew dross came and helped also and and I I said I think there's enough but you'll never know what it means to me that you would do that and uh brother Mann uh I don't know what day it was but he sent a text he was working all day yesterday didn't get home till late last night but uh must have been Friday he sent a text and said if you need me for anything this weekend I just wanted you to know well at that very moment I was just feeling a little overwhelmed and I said Lord so many are away and most of the ones who help us with those kinds of problems are gone this weekend and I'm just asking you to help us somehow and that text came and brother Steve poke I don't want to pick on folks but he called and he said I just want you to know I'm here brother Shelley I appreciated that and I know that every one of you brothers would have been but God let those calls come and those texts come when you're feeling a little I like it you know it would have meant something anytime but it sure did mean something to me we have a lot to pray about this morning but we don't have to worry about it because God is on the throne we want to continue to remember your sister Royale my royal jelly we want you to ask the Lord to completely heal her and restore her and we understand that there's a possibility that she is streaming the service this morning and if you are oops a little choked if you are we want to say how much we look why don't you all turn around and wave and if there's if she didn't get to see it if the nurse was in or something then Mary Bethel make sure she sees it at some point we send you our love and there's been a lot of prayers going up for her this week and God has moved and there are many things that are yet to be determined for her Rehabilitation and her care but we know that God's got the perfect place he's got the perfect helpers he's got the the perfect situation already in his mind he is not scrambling I understand all the doctors and Specialists are getting together to try to agree and come up with a plan but you know God is Not scrambling he doesn't have Glory he doesn't have to make any calls to consult with anyone else he knows exactly what is best and how to bring it to pass and so we want to lift her up to the Lord and Molly and her son are there mirabeth has been there this week and uh to as a great sacrifice but but that's where her heart wanted to be and we want to pray for her today it's good to be able to see her and to know that she is well and uh we're just believing every detail of that to fall into place this week uh sister Teresa is home with a fever not feeling well we want to hold her up to the Lord in prayer also Tiffany texted to say that her little girl is sick this morning and needs to be Hannah needs to be remembered to the Lord in prayer that God would help her and I understand that all of Zach's kids are sick this morning all three of them they need to be remembered high fevers and so forth and need to be remembered and if I know Liz she needs to be prayed for too so let's lift her up to the Lord she's at home taking care of sick babies um I don't know Sister Alfred has not been well this week but she's pushed her way through and is here this morning let's ask the Lord to help her I haven't heard anything from Sister Flo she's not feeling well so let's lift her up to God those who are traveling that the Lord will be with them we miss the greeleys and we ask the Lord to help them he was to preach for his dad today but the the scold and the snow and the ice have fixed that and there's no service there today but we just pray for all of those Saints there and I would just suggest if you uh maybe your service was called off for Christmas or maybe it was called off for cold weather but I would just suggest that someone go check the church laughs because when we came in this morning they came into a flood and there was water about halfway out through the vestibule none in the sanctuary praise the Lord bathroom men's bathroom floor flooded and the Blue Room wetter than I've ever seen it we've had two two problems and this one was a little bit deeper with the water but as I said to you before we started service this morning the people the brothers just started showing up sisters to toting a lot of stuff out of there by the way if you have something in there today is a marvelous day to get it we don't want to pick your precious Treasures up and have to take them back in there so why don't you take them home and there's a stack of hexagons that may go in the dumpster if I don't hear from Kendra and uh and uh charity today uh I'm just kidding but if you have something in there that's yours would you come and get them get it see look around coats you know you you probably needed that this weekend and we were storing it for you plates dishes I don't know what all water cups just whatever uh you know it's so funny because when we do this sometimes we put it out in the middle of the floor and people say well I don't have anything I know I don't have anything I know there's nothing of mine in there oh they're passing by oh that looks like my sweater there you know why you forgot it because we've been keeping it so long you forgot it you even had it you you all may discover a new wardrobe so please check the lost and found as you leave today um we want to continue to pray for those who will be traveling home this week and that God will be with them if you were following the The Adventures of Ben and Kendra and their family they left pretty early Friday morning and they got to their location our time after 3 A.M this morning so it took two and a half days what's that oh seven o'clock this morning that is a long two full days sin of travel and they finally made it and I heard that their one of their last episodes there they walked up to the counter and said could you just look and see if there's a way because they're they're uh their new flight had been delayed you know the new one they gave them had been delayed and uh the lady said there's no reason for me to look I have no flight for you going anywhere in the United States there are no flights so if you're already booked on a flight you will have to wait for that flight to eventually leave and that's what they did but God was with them and they made it but let's pray that everyone has a easier time getting back we'll do it this way this morning do you have a spoken request on this side that you'd like to call out to us as I probably missed one in my in my rambling sister Claudia absolutely sister Claudia's family in Brazil sister Megan you're who is that her car let's pray for her car she couldn't say Auto or Carr But Otto so I'm trying to think of who her German friend is okay Megan try that another Sunday would you someone else brother Steve I will I saw her troubled in service it was hurting ready for victory that's holder to the Lord in prayer over here brother Austin Gwendolyn that was the one I forgot I'm so sorry Gwendolyn isn't home this morning also not feeling good and really sick brother

say Lord help us help us we believe help us in our unbelief we know Lord that you have given us authority to speak to these bodies of ours and they must line up with the word of the Lord and the will of God and so we exercise that authority of this morning we speak over these bodies right now and we say come into Allah alignment with the father's Divine will and his plan for health and healing Lord you are our great protector thank you for watching over those who are traveling some on dangerous roads that they may or may not be used to traveling on but your angels are stationed there to watch over your own Lord I thank you for that I ask you to help automobiles that are not running properly and guide us Lord as we make our way through decisions and navigate life bless those brothers who have continuously worked even through the worship service to try to dry out the carpet in there Lord I pray that you will help us I pray that you will strengthen them and I pray Lord that there will be no real damage done but that will be able to just sort of fix what we can and pick up and give you the glory because you're so good to take care of us thank you for your presence that has been here today stay with us abide with us Lord we don't pray against fevers because fevers are there to help us to remind us to warn us of something that's going on but we speak to the root of these infirmities that are touching the bodies of the Saints and especially our dear children we ask o God that you would make them whole from the top of their head to the soles of their feet touch sister Beth today you were wounded you were bruised Lord for her Deliverance for her healing and we ask you right now to touch her body in the name of Jesus Oh Lord let there be a testimony of Victory come from her trial Lord thank you for touching Royale thank you for sparing her Lord I thank you God for all restoration and all Redemption I thank you for your plan for her life and I ask that it would unfold without the Enemy being able to hinder distract or impede it in any way we ask oh God that in the end of this and through it all you would receive glory for your name Hallelujah bless our time together in the word in a moment and may we pull together to hear from heaven and we'll give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it's in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen let's I know we're I know it's a song that's hard to get the tempo and we didn't practice let's sing the chorus again that we were singing and see if we can at least get the words in our spirit

sick this morning and I know I let it slip my mind because it was on Facebook and not a text but now I have a a text so let's lift them up to the Lord I think we just did but let's believe that God will touch them you know sometime we get to pray and we forget every name and we just say Lord but he does he knows he knows that's where it's up to you to put your faith up there and see he's talking about me I'm claiming that that one is mine you may be seated a moment and as soon as you hit the seat will you clap your hands for these musicians and worship leaders and God bless you all right would you all stay here though in one more song even though we're thankful for you I'm supposed to receive the tithe in the offering and uh I hope you've come this morning to prepare and prepared to sow into the work of the Lord he's prepared to give back to you pressed down shaken together and running over I know this doesn't matter to some but I'm really supposed to say it uh we are coming to the end of the year December 31st is the end of the year and if you have any giving that you want to count for the year 2022 some of you have already passed your limit and so you're just you're just giving to God because you love him and and you just want to help and there are others who don't claim their their giving and that's perfectly fine but I will let you know that as long as they allow it I'm going to claim mine as long as they will let me do it I'm going to use mine I appreciate the break how long do you think they're going to let us give to the church and get it off they fight every year to stop it but until they do I'm claiming mine you do what you want to do if you have anything that you want to get in uh before for this receipt that will come to you before the end of January then you want to get it in before December 31st God sees your heart and someone said I sure appreciated you mentioning the other day tithe does need to go in an envelope you don't have to put your name on it it can be anonymous but it needs to be marked tithe and that's for our our purposes the way that we handle the finances that come in God supplies all of our needs that's just who he is so if you have something prepared to give let's have a Elias to come I think one is enough for the number of people that we have not to leave Austin out he's all sharp and they're ready but let's just have Elias and so many are giving online these days and we appreciate that as well father you see each heart and you see how you have blessed and how you have prospered each life and now we take that and we give to you what belongs to you and we take a portion of what is ours and we sow that is offering because that's what we've been instructed to do and we've never regretted Lord I I I've been doing this a long time like so many gathered with us this morning and I've never regretted one penny one dollar that I've given to you it's always come back to me again and again and again and I thank you for it because that's who you are I like brother I like what brother Greely says Lord I Thank you that you are allowing us to keep Covenant with you we appreciate that this morning we ask for your blessing on The Giver in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and a man and amen I want us to sing uh the song we usually sing for baby dedications I want us to sing uh but right now slept so anybody won't give me a title not bring them in wrong Tabernacle God sent his son [Music] Came To Love kill I forget [Music] an empty Grace it's there to prove my savior let's sing to his glory because [Music] I can't Face Tomorrow sing it out because he lives thank you thank you [Music] I'm surprised yes yes [Music] cause he lives and then one day I'll cross the river I'll cross the river I'm gonna find that final war I'm gonna fight all the way till I get there yes or with pain pain I stand [Music] gives way to Victory I'll see the Lights Of Glorious [Music] sing again because I Can Face Tomorrow [Music] you better know that church because he lives of the Earth [Music] and life is worth just because he lives Give the Lord another praise thank you all praise God uh let me see uh Joseph would you step out there and see if your dad's on the phone uh if he's not would you ask him to put his head back in here um we want you to get ready for the word this morning we are going to turn to Romans chapter 10. beginning in verse 7. I get this text to tell me we're having streaming issues and uh my response is why am I not surprised you know it's just it's just par for the course the enemy's defeated Hallelujah I'm not Kosher I came in this morning and twisted in the eighth light that's not the it's not supposed to be lit till tonight but it was so aggravated with all what folks have been going through until I just said I'm going to just twist it in early when I go home I'm gonna lock my candle early I think just to say to the enemy you're just not going to stop us from going on we're going to Press On In Praise we're going to press on in faith amen many many of us have had unusual battles this week but Jesus Is the Victor and every one of them and we're giving him the praise I just wanted to say to Hawk uh so you can tell him when he's through that if they would use the messenger service on our app uh that may not be down and let people know that we're still up on YouTube if he would just put a little note on the app if you are here Among Us and you have our church app you should reload your app let it renew itself let it update and we have shifted back to a messenger service that's uh already in our fee so we don't have to pay anything extra for it and we are going to use it in fact in a few days we're going to do away with the other youth chat we don't want we don't need more and more I've got so many ways for people to get me and in touch with me and so we're going to go back and use our church app that God has blessed us with there are several groups on there if you don't want to be notified turn off your notifications but don't complain if something happens and you don't know about it if you've got your notifications turned off and uh so I I put out one this morning asking the brothers to come early if they possibly could I realize those who sleep until 10 minutes before church time they couldn't they couldn't come because they're still sleeping but those of us who are who get up on Sunday morning because the day belongs to him and we're getting ready for whatever God has for us we had folks coming in early and I appreciate that so much others didn't see it so let me just let you all know that this is going to be the main way that we get in touch with you uh for a service cancellations or for floods or for maybe just someday because we love you and want you to know it that's going to be the main way that you're in touch with our faith community it's through the app so if you don't have it you need to get it if you've got a phone so old that you can't load it on there you need a new phone you can do it you can get a new one it doesn't have to be brand new it doesn't have to be the latest bells and whistles but you can do better if you need to somebody may even have an old one laying around somewhere that they would sell you for about five bucks or something and but we want you to to be in touch with us that way uh it's just good to know we you know we never know we we don't know we don't know we don't know what will happen we don't know what's coming we've got two years of hanging on to Jesus like never before and that's what we're going to do is hang on to him well we're very happy to have Samuel and isaiahkins are with us this morning very happy because they spent the worship service helping their workers they are they're kind of farmers you know real cowboys and they jumped in and got the work done would you help me welcome the Kinser boys and men young men long time friends of mine and I worshiped and preached for their daddy their Granddaddy and their great-granddaddy so that's that's pretty good family history isn't it so we're very glad that they've come to be no they didn't come for Christmas like someone might have suggested they don't celebrate Christmas they're one of the few families and few churches I know that don't have anything to do with that if you're waiting for my Christmas message let me refer you to the app it was preached Saturday night December 17th you'll be able to find it there on the app that's my my Christmas message to you Deuteronomy 30. we're gonna go there I told you Romans Deuteronomy 30 and verse 14 but the word is very near you in your mouth and in your mind and in your heart so that you can do it now Romans 10 that was in the Amplified Romans 10 verses 7 through 11 or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up Christ again from the dead but what saith it the word is neither even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt confess I'm in verse 9 of Romans 10 that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus I want you to do that I confess with my mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved is there anybody saved here this morning you believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead doesn't say anything about how he got here in the fullness of time God made sure that he showed up but if you will confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus Christ is not his last name Christ lets us know that he is identified with the anointing he is the anointed one he is the mashiach he is the Messiah and if we believe that God hath raised him from the dead we are saved and we claim that this morning verse 10 for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation did you know confession is as important as what you believe what comes out of your mouth is as important as what you believe so you've got to confess it confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed you let the world around us Rock and reel and toss to and fro but we believe in him and we'll not be ashamed we don't have to be in line for anxiety treatments we don't have to be in line for depression treatment we can get a hold of God and if you haven't keep keep pulling keep reaching we can get a hold of God and we can have wholeness that he has promised us in his word amen if you're not there yet you just keep doing what you do and keep reaching and keep believing because I can tell you right up front it is not God's will that we depend on those things to get through life he wants us to be able to depend on him may God help us Lord thank you for your word it is life to us it is wholeness and it is health and it is help and we thank you for it in the marvelous name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory we say amen you may be seated I'd like to have at least one of those doors open uh into the vestibule please if the if the vacuum is off now in the message the spoken word is the Original Seed paragraph 119. we just read this to you recently and uh but we it's been a few few Services now and so I want to take you back so that you will that was the first quote on those notes and so they're working to pull that up and this is sort of the theme of going to try to finish this out this morning and and get ready for something else on on Tuesday when we meet God willing my mission this is Brother Branham talking my mission that I believe that God has called me for I have to say some personal things today because that's what I told you I do see and tell the world my mission I believe to the Earth is to forerun the coming word I I want you to know something that strikes me so profound so profound because as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ God had a servant set aside and prepared that he might forerun the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ if you struggle with the fact that God used brother Branham to forerun the second coming do you also struggle that he used John the Baptist to forerun the first coming he's going to choose somebody he's going to use somebody and you know what I'm going to be that somebody for my generation and you should too because we're we're out of that hour where we have one Messenger to an age that's Finnish now and now it's a body bride it's everyone all hands on deck we're not waiting on somebody to take the place of a one-man Ministry we're waiting on a bride Ministry to begin to expand and move forward to take us right into a sweep that causes the Rapture The Sweep is what produces a Rapture because our faith gets to such a level that we begin to just speak like God speaks and when we do that we get an ocean and we call with thus saith the Lord we call for the resurrection of the Dead I'm just telling you what he's saying maybe we need to brush up on our seals but this is what he told us we have to look forward to and I believe we're closer to that Hour the full manifestation of the adopted sons of God than we have ever been before I believe the authority is already in our mouths to do what we're going to do I believe it's already there and we're just waiting on the grace and the timing of the Lord to exercise what's already in us we're not waiting on authority to come it's here I'll show you that in just a moment he goes on to say is to forerun the coming word see the coming word which is Christ and and not just Christ in any form it's not just Christ in any form he first came in a physical Corporal body corporate body Corporal body excuse me he first came in that in that way and then he came in the fullness of his word and now he is coming in the fullness of a bride body so it's Christ's coming but not just him coming anyway it's how is he coming Christ in him has the Millennium and has everything right there because he is the word Christ is the word I I read this week that the that the hymn that has become a Christmas Carol the hymn that was written Joy to the World originally was never written to be used as a Christmas carol it was written about the millennium now in that interesting news doesn't matter I I like the words anyway I love that I'm not saying uh that I didn't like it because it was used as a Christmas Carol although most Christmas carols were written by Jews I think you know that don't you but anyway uh this was a song that was originally written about the Millennium Joy to the World the Lord Has Come let Earth receive her King think of it and that's how it's going to be one of these days he came the first time and some people missed his coming he's coming for his bride and some will miss his coming but when he comes to set up his Millennial Reign no one will miss his coming everyone will know that King Jesus has risen he has arrived on the scene and he's ready to finish out the work that he was sent to do and called to do amen and he's not coming in the Millennium as a little weave baby in a Manger in fact you'll never see him that way again he'll never ever ever be reduced to that again the next time you see him he comes as king of kings and Lord of lords as Lion of the tribe of Judah he has fulfilled himself as the Lamb of God and he comes as the lion of the tribe of Judah the worthy one to take the book and to loose the seals thereof so brother Branham we we all have our ideas and we got lists some of us have 50 things we think and believe that God sent brother Branham to do but I like to let him speak for himself he said I believe my commission my my purpose is to forerun the coming word which is Christ now let's let him do that let's not allow his coming to be in vain let's get a hold of Christ the word let's hold on to Christ now let's honor the messenger and love him but let's not idolize brother Branham brother Brandon was a human being and he said himself he made many mistakes and we're going to allow him that because he was Flesh and Blood we're going to get a hold of Christ and hold on to him because I want you to know there will be no no discrepancies in Christ there there will be no memory lapses in Christ there will be no differentiation between what he says and what he does you won't have to sort through any of that when we're talking about Christ he is the worthy one he is the word he is the Millennium it's all in him now who are you if Christ is the word and the word is Christ who are you we found out I'm going to review this with you quickly before we skip ahead uh paragraph 148 of the spoken word is the Original Seed the prophet tells us all of God's Sons must be the same yes sir to be born of the word yes Lord somebody said oh I want to be born to the word you already were if you ever will be we are born of the word can't take spirit it's our origin we were born from the spirit we were born from the word we can't lose the word now we were born of the word we can't give away the spirit Hallelujah we were born of the spirit it's our origin to be born of the word and spirit thus what read this with me it brings us back to the spoken word again the word that said let there be light boom the word that said let the mountains be formed boom that spoken word the word that said sister Hattie I give you your desire what is it that you want I give it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the spoken word the spoken word that said little fishy I give you your life that's the spoken word the word that said to the storm in Hurricane Mountain you cease to blow so that we can get out of here unharmed that same spoken word is to be in the mouth of the Bride that spoken word that said before the doctor's hand touches her side sister Nita the tumor will disappear that spoken word Hallelujah five manifestations of the spoken word in our day to remind us of who God is and to put a faith in our heart that that same word is for us all of God's Sons must be the same yes sir to be born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again can everyone say Amen like in John 3 see to be born of the water and the spirit what does it do then look what it does it brings you right back again are you with me unto the place of where you should have been I'm gonna read it I'm gonna just have fun today I'm just gonna read it again I like you have fought hell all week long and I'm just going to enjoy myself today it brings you right back again unto the place of where you should have been at the beginning Hallelujah back to the beginning you know we who came from Pentecost we like to use the quotes where brother random sent back to Pentecost back to the original Manna I love that I believe that I believe that's exactly what the church has to come to be exactly what it was in the beginning with me with me you know what the church was in the beginning mighty mighty signs and wonders and miracles no Christmas no Easter I said the early church see we are we are absolutely contending struggling fighting pushing for the faith that was what once delivered to the Saints that's a precious truth it's an undefiled truth how many of you believe the early church was undefiled it certainly was it was pure and look what God has done today he's brought us right back to the original word that the early church believed brother random said I'm preaching to you exactly what Paul preached and he said if I preach you anything other than what Paul preached I'm in trouble anybody with me so a lot of people are trying to have him to say things that we can't trace back to the word he took himself all the way back to the first church age messenger and said you see all I am to do I believe brother Greely mentioned this seven I all I am to do he said is to tie together the Loose Ends that were left throughout all the other Church ages how many of you are glad that God has tied loose sins together in your mind I tell you what we're not where we where we used to be because God has made things clear that didn't used to be clear he wants to but listen he doesn't just want to take us back to original Pentecost he didn't want to just take us back to the early church look where he wants to take us back to the beginning where Adam had authority over creation and could say little tree Puck up move yourself over here and put yourself back down that's how Adam tended the garden he didn't do it by a shovel he didn't do it by gardening knee pads no sorry he did it by the word of his mouth you say I don't believe there will be anything like that to the Millennium then you don't believe this message you don't believe this word brother random didn't say that would only be restored in the millennium I'll start let's go back and read this again all of the sons of God must be the same yes sir to be born of the word and the spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in John 3 see to be born to the water in the spirit what does it do then it brings you right back again right back again to where sons of God right back to where sons of God how many of you know you're a son of God wait a minute I want to see your hand Olivia Ellsworth I want to see your hand there you go what a smile she flashed I didn't know what she's gonna Flash I didn't know she'd flash embarrassment or anger or aggravated or what all she flashed a smile sons of God hold up your hand let me see praise the Lord now you're awake blood flowing again that's where we've been restored to Hallelujah my my my so so that's ever more the reason not to look back to a God who lived in a Manger it's now now to look ahead and see a God that lives in his people all right spoken word 181 I know I know I keep I'm going to jump over in a minute to something that we didn't cover but I I think we we need to be reminded of these things again uh 181 Hallelujah can you see the word takes flesh David I just saw you and as I saw you I remembered that I should have requested a prayer for Ashley who is working today as a nurse and uh has worked many hours of late and is expecting a baby may God strengthen her and and I'll I'll just tell you this uh I don't want anybody to miss church for their job but if I was sick and I was up there in in a hospital room I would be so thankful to have an Ashley who was available to come and minister to me and come and help me and having sat in the hospital several days this year with my mother and and see the different nurses to come in and how worn out they are and how I would always try to strike up a conversation and most of them said I lose my my passion sometime and and I have to I have to refocus myself but overall I'm I'm glad that this is what I've been called to do and it is a calling so may God strengthen her today paragraph 181 Hallelujah can you see the word word takes flesh there you are God is going to have a church it's going to be born of the word of God because it [Music] that's who you are somebody said is that is that Blasphemous for me to say that I'm the Living Word of God no that's exactly what you are an expression of the Living Word of God if you were not an expression of the Living Word of God you wouldn't be here today you'd have a hangover you'd have had more eggnog last night than you needed [Music] come on now it don't just put inches on you a lot of it's spiked isn't it and there's a lot of people that are going to celebrate the day-to-day half a day with a headache because that's what these kind of holidays mean to them but that's not what it means to us we are here today like we will be next Sunday and like we will be the next if Jesus tarries the Rapture hadn't come and caught us away because we understand that we are the representation of the Living Word of God brother random asks a question in his generation I'm asking a question in mind do you see it do you see it do you see it and then in paragraph 277 8 and 9 he said now his body his body is to do the same because the body is head and body together that right if Christ is the head was the word his body has to be the same thing as his head was so what's the body what is his body the word because the head Christ is the word amen are you there he said that right a church of the word born of the word virgin born from the word not denominational now virgin born from the word the way the body operates is by the head is that right my body can't move until my head tells it to move all right in the next in in the end of that paragraph he said well if my head is Christ and my body is a denomination how's it going to work not very well how can Purity and a work together let me talk to you just a minute about the the miracle of Hanukkah there are so many miraculous aspects of that of that event and we have a tendency to focus on the fact that that one pot of oil that was only to last in the Holy Menorah one day miraculously lasted eight days we weren't there we know that it is sometimes referred to as a legend we're not sure if it happened at all but what we do know is it sounds just like the Lord sounds just like the way God works I'll tell you this if God could take that little ragtag army and and cause them to defeat the Greek army who I have told you multiple times came against them with with all kinds of weapons and Armory and artillery and and even uh stomped against them with elephants and yet God raised up those little Jewish men and caused them to if God could do that he can take one pot of oil and we mentioned last week he did it for the little widow woman he multiplied her oil but I read an interesting article this week that said one of the most amazing Miracles is not that one pot of oil was multiplied for eight days it was the fact that one pot of oil was found and considered pure did you know that there was plenty of oil left in the temple plenty of oil there there's no way in the world that they would have gotten down to one pot of oil there were pots of oil everywhere in the storehouses but the Greeks did a little research and they found out that by defiling the temple they defiled the oil interesting isn't it and so they were they were absolutely Desiring to Stamp Out not not Judaism as we know it but if you read the article the sister Joyce posted they were they were sent out to destroy monotheism which is the the faith of one God believing there is one God I want you to know your very unique people today because you believe you really believe in one God three manifestations but but one God hear ye o Israel the Lord God is one the Roman Catholic Church doesn't believe in one God so you're very unique in the fact that you believe in one God there are also many Jews who claim that they believe in one God but if you get to really talking about how they understand things you will find out that for them he is sort of a sort of an idea I want you to know God is more than an idea he's a living reality amen and Muslims they're not quite sure who their God is they call him Allah but the god that they talk about today doesn't even fit the god of their own writings so they're in great conflict and that and most churches are trinitarian by nature in Christianity most the majority are and so they don't believe in one God so you're getting more and more unique as the day goes by and they tell us that one of the things the Greek General hated the most was the fact that the Jews were monotheistic and that they only believed in one God and he was determined to stamp them out and you know what they didn't fight it was not their idea to fight other religions or to annihilate other religions in fact the Jews were one of the only groups of people in the world that wasn't trying to wipe out all the other religions you know why because they had confidence in their God because they knew he was the one true Living God and although they hated paganism they didn't spend their time trying to end paganism they spent their time trying to keep paganism out of their Church anybody with me so God performed a miracle because not only was there a pot of oil found it was pure and the Seal of the high priest had not even been broken on it wow so God hid it where he hit it where they found it I don't even know but the seal was not broken it could not have been used if the Seal of the high priest had been broken on that oil there would have been no problem finding oil I want you to know there were Vats full of olive oil was flowing freely in the land of Israel but they had to find some oil that had been koshered by the priests that had been blessed by the priest and that fit the requirements of the law and that had the Seal of the high priest only so this is a real Miracle the miracle is that in the in the in the midst of of oil that was not pure they were able to find a pot of oil that God had preserved and kept clean and kept paganism away from it because the pagans actually went down the line and the oil that was stored in the temple they went down the line popping the seals they wanted to do everything they could they they forbade circumcision they forbid the keeping of the Sabbath come on they were forbidding all kinds of anything they could do they were outlawing anything that had to do with the faith of the Jewish people I want to tell you something Jesus wasn't against tradition either there's a lot of people that have this idea that Jesus was against tradition he was not against tradition in fact he kept the tradition of his fathers every Passover he kept the tradition of his fathers God is the one who instituted Passover but the fathers are the ones who decided how they would celebrate it and he was all right with that what he what problem he had with tradition is this and he would have a big problem with the church today including the message search he'd have a big problem with some of us because what he was against is when tradition is so so strong that it renders the word of God non-effective God can't even do what he said he would do in his word because tradition has taken the place of the absolute anybody with me this is how we've always done it so for me I celebrate this time of the year not to substitute Christmas I celebrate this time of the year because I feel like Judah Maccabee I feel like one of those Brothers I feel like one of those men who have been called to defend the purity of the word and the same God that kept one pot of oil hidden undefiled so that he could do his job that's the same God that's keeping a holy Remnant pure there is a pure Remnant being kept in this world today by the message of the hour by the power of the Holy Ghost by the absolute truth of God's word he is preserving a people that are without blemish in his eyes in his eyes that's what we're working toward to be without blemish in his eyes all right so anyway I just I just want to stick that in because you know I don't care if it burned one night never burned again it was pure oil that God didn't allow the devil to contaminate with his filth whoa that oil represented one God same God that you and I are serving today the same God we followed into real Christian baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ anybody here come on now the same God that we followed into the true understanding of who he is not three pieces of the same pie not a God that can be divided a God that can be recognized in all of his many manifestations and offices but at the end of the day he's not three he's not 13 he's not 24 he's one one Essence one God one Spirit are you there all right and then in the end the last part of 279 the the way the body operates is by the head and the head is the word the head is the word see that's right and that's exactly what he said now I want you to go uh with me we're skipping now a few places we're going to the church age book we read a long one in the church age book already but we're going to read one more long one if that's all right we're going to where you will see the quote begin with the scripture Revelation chapter 3 verse 17 and 18. and I don't know how you have it in your in your notes there but I I put it in blue so that you would be able to identify it as a scripture but I think when you copy well there you go all right I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thouard cold or hot so than because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth we're going to look at this carefully it says that this layout to see in church age group is lukewarm and I want to say I know that and I recognize that to be nothing but the truth is there anybody who sees that that is the same and that's not it that's the first place go down to the second place I think that's the first time that's 15 and 16. go to 17 and 18. Revelation 3 17 and 18. it's uh there it is now you're there that's it because thou says I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know it's not that thou art would you read that wretched miserable poor blind and naked he's not talking to the world he's talking to the church laodicean church now remember these are not just seven churches in Asia Minor but they absolutely carry the characteristics of the seven Church ages that can be laid across church history and so the world right now the church as we know it right now is living in the closing hours of laodicea and here is the scriptural uh description of who she is he goes on to say I counsel thee to buy of Me Jesus gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich so your money means nothing your Steeples mean nothing your stained glass windows mean nothing your multi-campus you know uh Ministries mean nothing you said I want you to come to me and buy gold try it in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white Riemann that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with what I almost said Grease I have but brother Branham could understand that I save he talked about the grease I don't know but somebody might could have used that this week uh so cold in the Log Cabin where brother Branham grew up in the chinking in the logs would sometimes dry out and fall out and the cold wind would blow and he talks about there being snow on the blanket on his bed waking up with snow on the blanket on the bed because it blew through the cheek that's cold we have nothing to complain about and all the little kitties wake up and their eyes so matted together does anybody even know what that's like their eyes so matted together from the cold that they couldn't even open their eyes so mama would go over to the wood stove light the fire pull the grease over to the eye of the wood stove heat that up and rub that warm grease in their eyes until their eyes would would unstick and until that that matting that was there would be cleaned out and then she would would rinse that out of their eyes so that they could see and brother banham said this is really it reminded him of this ice Sav that we need thank God for Isaiah thank God for Isaiah you see it that's why I'm not here this morning asking you what you did this time last year it doesn't matter to me what you were doing this time last year what matters to me is that you've allowed the Holy Ghost to provide ourselves we can't be held accountable for what we can't see we have to ask the Lord to begin to reveal and I want you to know if there's ever been an hour where God's going to pull his bride closer it ought to be this hour and he's not pulling them to a man he's not pulling them to a pastor he's pulling them closer to his word if you believe that same man let's go on with the church age quote here he said now look at the first phrase of this verse because thou sayest see they were speaking the church they were talking as the mouthpiece of God he said this proves exactly what I said verses 16 and 17 men but though they say it that does not make it right the Catholic Church says she speaks for God saying she is the assured voice of the Lord how many of you know that's just not true he said how any people can be so spiritually Wicked spiritually Wicked it's more than I know but they produce oh yes but they produce according to the seed which is in them you see it's manifesting time and we know where that seed come from don't we the layers laodicean churches saying I'm rich increase with good have need of nothing we treat each other right we don't talk about one another we're mission-minded Folk we've got everything we need wealthy in the things of this world that's not enough that was her self-estimate she looked at herself and that is what she saw she said I'm rich which means that she is wealthy and the things of this world we're going on now she is boasting in the face of James 2 5-7 hearken my beloved Brethren hath not God chose him the poor of this world rich in faith Heirs of the Kingdom which he had promised to them that love him but ye have despised the poor you've really despised the poor he said do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the Judgment seats do not they blaspheme that worthy Name by which you are called he said now I do not suggest that a rich person cannot be spiritual but we all know that the word says very few are it is the poor that predominate in the body of the Church of the true church now then if the church becomes full of wealth we know only one thing Ichabod amen very interesting isn't it see God won't Prosper us who know the truth with compromise the only way that we'll ever be prospered is If We Hold to the word so so we see churches prospering out there with no Doctrine whatsoever they don't even realize that Ichabod has already been written over the door the spirit of the Lord is already departed and the programs were so amazing that nobody even knew that Jesus left the building they're sad he said you can't deny that for that is the word talk about wealth in the church why there never has been such a show of wealth the beautiful sanctuaries are multiplied in number as never before why why churches today are like cities they're like old towns the various groups said the man that God has given 60 plus acres aren't we blessed the various groups Vie with each other to see who can build the biggest and the loveliest and they build education Sinners worth unestimated millions and those buildings are used only an hour to a week now that would not be such a terrible thing but they expect this little time spent by the children in the education plan to take the place of the hours of training supposed to be given in the home [Music] I tell you that's an indictment because brother Branham is talking about a generation who turns their children over to the church expecting Sunday school to train them for life it's not enough cookies and Kool-Aid and coloring a Jesus picture and singing Jesus loves all the little children that's not going to be enough to get those children ready to live life oh no that's Mom and Daddy's place money is poured into the church until different denominations own stocks and bonds factories oil wells and insurance companies they've poured money into welfare and retirement funds now this sounds good but it has become a snare to the ministers for if they decide to leave anybody's offended that I have 3 550 in retirement account please come see me and I'll take it out that's what I have 3 550 if that if that disqualifies me from the ministry let me know and we'll all go eat a steak all right for if they decide to leave their group for more light or the love of God to them stand this and stay with their well if we take a stand about that who will preach our camp meeting if we make a stand against that who who will come into our youth camp now don't forget that that is that this is the last age we know that this is the last age because Israel has gone back to its Homeland I'm not going to say back to Palestine because that's not what I believe it should ever be called if we believe that he really is coming then there must be something wrong with those who are building so vastly it makes one think that these people plan on staying here forever do you realize this was in the 60s are that the coming of Jesus is hundreds of years off that's kind of how they live do you know that Religion Today is known as Big Business it is an absolute fact that they are placing business managers in the churches to take care of Finance this is 60s is this what God desires did not his word teach us in the book of Acts that seven Men full of the Holy Ghost and Faith serve the Lord in business matters you can surely see why God said you say you are wealthy I never said so there are radio programs television programs and numerous Church Endeavors that are costing millions and millions of dollars wealth Pours and pours into the church the membership increases along with the money yet the work is not being done as it was done when there was no money but men rested solely on the ability given to them by the Holy Ghost powerful powerful powerful there are paid preachers paid assistance paid Ministers of music and education paid choirs paid custodians programs entertainment oh costing great sums for all that the power is decreasing yes the church is Rich but the power is not there God moves by his Spirit God moves by his Spirit not by the amount of money or talent in the church no wonder brother Brandon said the church no longer speaks for God the church is speaking for herself but the bride the bride must be available to speak for God do you believe that now we move on quickly we don't have to be here all day you know in the message the testimony of a true witness 1961. now we're getting somewhere paragraph 186 I want you to hear this he said what church that's the reason I can't take the baptism of the Holy Ghost of crying shaking or speaking tongues or any sensation they're all right now see them things are all right but the devil can impersonate that so real so we cannot judge the genuineness of someone's holy spirit because they shook or spoke in tongues or had sensation brother random is in no way taking these away from the experience but here's what he wanted us to understand is the definition of a person who is truly baptized with the Holy Ghost 187 you know you ought to mark this down or or go on the app and copy and paste this or something you ought to read this often you you ought to be in a bad trial you you ought to be hurting uh wait till you got some pain going on somewhere and you want to pull your hair out and and troubles and trials and every phone call uh is is is worse than the one before it and every text is worse than the one before it and you're being criticized for things you don't even know why you're being criticized you you don't even understand exactly what you've done all this piling in on you then you ought to pull this quote out and read but the Holy Ghost is deity [Music] glory god tabernacled in man not only one man not only one man and a generation God tabernacled in man if you've received the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost God is tabernacled in your body it's more than a sensation amen you see I underline that for you it's more than in speaking in tongues yes amen it's more than shouting in the spirit I believe that it's more than weeping sure it is it's more than joining church it's what God Living God living God living in man it's God living in man deity deity well that's God is that God did that's who God is God himself tabernacled into that person this is what we need to be focusing on not some happy birthday Jesus junk please please I have precious friends that I have fought in the trenches with who baked the Lord a birthday cake I hope you sit at your kitchen table until he comes and takes a bite this is so late in the hour honestly folks it's so late in the hour I have a precious friend that I have I've really fought with and for who posted this picture of a man dressed up in a Santa Claus suit it wasn't the famous painting but it was a man dressed up in a Santa Claus suit kneeling down at the at a picture of Jesus this is blasphemy this is paganism it it's so turns my stomach first of all we're not Catholic and we don't bow down to pictures you thought I was going to talk about the man in the suit didn't you I didn't even get to that here he is kneeling down before a picture of Jesus why would you want to find a picture of Jesus to honor to show kindness to or respect for when there's a church room full of jesuses there's some people here who have been filled with the very life of Jesus Christ show kindness to them bake them a cake do something nice for one another but to bow down to a picture of Jesus is is worse than Catholicism it's idolatry it's you're just as bad when you do that as the as the African who bows his knee to a picture of brother Branham it's it's absolutely Antichrist and idolatry so then then let's just say that the the picture represents Jesus let's just say that it does let's just say that the picture represents Jesus and you've got a man here with his back turned to the to the to the crowd uh with a Santa Claus suit on kneeling down now the first message I got is that's idolatry we don't bow the pictures and the second message that I got was what kind of message are you trying to show your your social media followers here is a myth oh come on well it's a phony it's it's a modern day man dressed up in a phony suit so so he's celebrating Halloween isn't he he's got on a costume he knows he's not Santa Claus so he's a phony hypocrite I'm just telling you what the picture says to me and he's bowing down to a picture of Jesus and you show that to some child and what do they see confusion and a lie because it would make you wonder if this one down here kneeling down there's no such truth to him what about this this one up here folks we ought to know better than that so you keep your birthday give give somebody in here a cake and let them tote the pounds around Jesus doesn't want your cake Jesus wants your life he wants you to celebrate by yielding your life to him God himself tabernacled in that person when he can speak [Music] go back to the beginning of paragraph 187 because I interrupted it with my own story but the Holy Ghost is deity God tabernacled in a man it's more than a sensation more than speaking in tongues more than shouting in the spirit it's more than weeping it's more than joining church it's God living in man deity God himself tabernacled in that person when he can speak and it's just the same as God's speaking that's the Church of Jesus Christ that's the way the First Apostolic Church went forth I want to ask you for do do you believe that that's the way the First Apostolic Church went forth do you believe they spoke for God do you believe in your heart that there ought to be a last day people doing the same today I believe with all my heart I believe with all my heart so I I'd forgive us if we don't have time uh to to patty cake with you forgive us that there's a time to to play there's a time to pray there's a time to be a clown I like funny foreign what I don't like is when people think they're funny and they're definitely not some things are taboo and some things are off limits and some things we shouldn't try to make funny because there's nothing at all funny about them anybody with me they're just certain things in certain subjects we should never try to make a joke of or try to make it laughable because it's just too serious of a subject to be laughable at all I'm not against having a good time I'm not against being funny I'm not against poking on one another I've told you before that's my love language when I quit poking on you that's when you need to be concerned some of you have not known long enough to poke on you much yet but I'm I'm working on it I'm I'm getting my ammunition up I'm not against that I'm not against that but there's a times for those kinds of things and there's a time to be serious there's a time to understand that we are here representing a God in the earth and and what comes out of our mouth is being weighed all the time whether we realize it or not every word that comes out of our mouth is being weighed by a living God he hears our slang he hears our euphemisms he hears it he knows we would never take the name Jesus Christ in some vain way but he knows when we use other words better euphemisms for Jesus Christ he's our disrespect you think I'm going to use JC as the initials of Jesus Christ when I'm writing something are you kidding don't you have any respect at all you see people become so common that they become so frivolous and then you you get up here and you try to talk to him about deity and God tabernacling in man and they say Amen but they don't see it because if they saw it they'd be reaching for it you need to join the ranks of those who are actively reaching for that time that when I speak it's God speaking through me when you speak it's God speaking through you why because we've got cancers that we need to see disappear We've Got Brains that we need to see the miracle of epigenetics we need to see God renewing and reforming brains we need to seek God recreating damage damage that has been done and God recreating healthy cells we've come down to that hour where we're going and we're coming even to a tighter time when we're going to need that Authority we're going to need that Authority we're going to need it we're certainly going to need it in the message the word became flesh sometimes called the India trip report but I can't recommend that message enough 1954. I can't recommend that message enough it's so much more than an India trip report brother random says some of the most powerful things of his ministry in that message 1954 October the 3rd and in paragraph 238 and he said now to redeem that Fallen race I'll send forth my son Christ Jesus there was the word in the beginning before it was a word it was a thought before it was a thought it was expressed in a word and the word became material and the word became material and dwelt among us hallelujah 10 million years maybe before the world was ever formed God's thought seen his body tabernacled in flesh what for to take the sting out of death powerful he said how Eternal is the word of God all times will change years will come and go ends of time will pass away but God's word will remain forever there it is 2022 is coming to an end in 2023 is about to begin and God's clock just keeps on ticking it doesn't even register the change do you hear me God's God's clock doesn't even register the change someone asked are we going to have a watch Night Service this coming weekend we're not but we're going to have Sunday morning service at 11 o'clock and you have no excuse not to be here I'm certainly not going to encourage people staying out till after midnight and then preaching to a sleeping congregation on Sunday morning so we're gonna do it one time next Sunday and we're gonna do it till we get done so no no watch tonight service you want to have a watch tonight you gather around in your house but just remember that God's clock doesn't shift or change he does not follow the Pope's calendar can somebody say man God doesn't follow the Pope's calendar he's got his own why would he need the popes anything that God's already speaking into this coming year it's already here it's already with us and maybe it will accelerate I've seen it accelerate and be accentuated around the time that the Gregorian calendar changes but it's more important for us to be here Sunday morning alert ready to hear the word of God ready to worship like you did this morning those people who had not heard and didn't know they would have never known that there had been a flood they would never know that people had to go home and change clothes to come back and help they would have never known that people were waiting through water in their dress shoes to get the job done and toting my life in those four filing cabinets out of there at their full brother sister anybody left you Brothers need prayer for your backs you would know that all that had gone on right till right till church and some were all were working through worship to get it you wouldn't have known that because we we determined before we started we're here to give God glory now let me let me move on in a message called we've made a little progress here got a few more minutes three kinds of Believers you know there's always three kinds of Believers in every Church I would love to say except ours but we can't True Believers unbelievers make believers they're always there paragraph 63 of said message and here we are down to the layout to see an age and we're caught in the laodicean age that Christ was put out of his church and was even knocking on the door trying to get back in so when we see that happening we know what age we're living in anybody know we're living in laodicea one of my dear friends before he passed away had the church in Philadelphia of all the ages I would have never guessed that we would have been in Philadelphia a church age because that was the church age of Brotherly Love and you don't have to be anybody to know there's not a whole lot of Brotherly Love we've definitely passed the age of Brotherly Love we're definitely now in the last of the last days and that's how we recognize it he said and then we're at the closing of the history of the world the book is now being finished the last line will be wrote across it someday and she'll be closed up then time shall be no more and there's a great drama being set I want you to see this there's a great drama being said and angels are standing over the skies watching I want you just to imagine that we're not we're not into some kind of meditation or meditative imagery but I'd like for you to just kind of Imagine in your mind the sky is full uh today of angels looking over looking over the clouds right down into December 25th of 2022 maybe looking over this Campground looking over your neighborhood where you live looking over the place where you work all looking over the Earth you you there's a drama that the angels are standing over the skies watching you know what a drama is the actors are ready and you can see them beginning to act playing out their roles you can see the evil one acting how many of you see him showing up he's showing out all the time you can see the villain of the play how he's come on the scene with the cunningness to deceive anybody recognize that kind of spirit in the world today but you can also see the Rapture Church making herself ready I love the way he words this you see in brother random's mind she's already raptured you see in God's mind she's already raptured you see in my mind she's already raptured because the Rapture is a process and the Rapture is in progress now it's already started we're not waiting on on a Rapture to begin we're waiting on a Rapture to finish the Rapture has already started somebody said why how could you say such thing the Bible said in Revelation chapter 4 and a voice said come up I want to show you some things that you don't know anything about that's the bride John represents the broad church when John was called up that that symbolizes for us the bride has been caught up and she's got the Isaiah and she sees some things today she never saw before so the Rapture is already moving brother he said but can you also see the Rapture Church making herself ready it's a great scene you can see the presence of God vindicating and making the great drama that's foretold here in the Bible to act itself out it's just clicking along I want you to see clicking along somebody said oh my I sure did throw a kink in the wheel when Joe Biden come along not at all in fact it might have just slowed things down a little bit he's slow I might have just slowed things down a little bit but it's still moving still moving still moving and come next election when the when so many in our nation don't get what they want to be the same kind of thing oh my the next one who comes he may not be too old to do the job it may not be too mentally oppressed to do the job he may be Sharp and he may get the job done and we may have lots to complain about come on but you just remember that oh I felt something there God's drama would just keep right on moving keep right on cooking just let me tell you something God doesn't have to have President Trump for his economy did you keep moving on and I'll tell you what America is going to get she's going to get exactly what she deserves [Music] that's how this thing works you know we're so close to the end time now that's exactly how it works we vote our convictions according to how God has taught us in the word but we also understand that it's God who puts up God who pulls it come on now come on now what a time to live the most glorious time what you must not know about my week what a time to live the most glorious time the man of all ages oh I believe it I believe it I believe the bride in every Church age has longed to see this day and here we are long for this time the prophets of old long to see this hour but wasn't privileged now there was a Believer because he's seen it he believed it we're fully persuaded that thou art the Christ the Messiah the word of God for this day and we believe that see that was a real believer I want you to know there are some real believers there are some real believers now let me let me identify you and we're nearly done in the message questions and answers this happens to be 59 and if you're tired get get untired Shake It Off because I want you to hear this this is one of my favorite places he said what is it 127 paragraph a angel is a servant we're sons and daughters which is the most thought of your servant or your son or daughter oh my prayer from a saint will go a million times higher than an angel because a saint is a son I want you to know folks your prayers matter I want to tell you something your prayers matter I want you to say my prayers matter they matter they matter they matter they matter they matter he said oh Hugh that's right my brother sister let's go on you you don't he said I don't believe this sign of Eternity I will ever realize that what you are the position that you are that God has placed you you Spirit-filled people you are sons of God why Angel's a servant you're a son an angel can only bring you a message but you have to act amen you're the actor on the scene I don't want you to just see the devil doing his business I don't want you to see the pieces in the play the actors and the and the drama that that the enemy puts in place I want you to see yourself as a peace in God's chess game I want you to see yourself as an actor in God's drama is here to carry out a particular thing that no one else can carry out in your family in your community on your job in your sphere of influence in this house in our outreaches it's powerful you see yourself actor you're the actor on the scene you're the son the angel is your servant to bring you the message he said say here I brought you this message for you to do so and so this is from the father I bring it to you yes that's all he is amen your sons and daughters of God predestinated us now watch just a minute and he goes to the scripture according as he hath chosen us now we didn't choose how could I choose him 400 billion 400 billion million billion trillion years ago how could I have chose him but he chose me amen and that is what the scripture said oh brother wood that's it see chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Hallelujah now don't try to make it yourself because you can't and Without Blame before him in love oh brother that will answer a question I see in here just a few minutes ago somewhere I just seen it oh yes you said how could a man live above live so close to God he could he would be without sin listen to this holy from the foundation of the world that we should be holy let's go back from the foundation of the world that we should be holy from the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love come on preachers read it his love did it you believe it his love paid for my sins his love taking it away love is the most powerful force there is I want to ask you a very serious question did you get off this week let me see a hand of someone who say brother Shelley I had a moment I got off I got off I got off the target I'm sure I did and it might have had one every day but his love paid for my sin his love taking it away love is the most powerful force there is but you can't just expect that to be automatic you've got to Fellowship that you've got to ask for forgiveness when you realize you've done wrong and then all that God has promised is activated in your life he said take a husband that really loves his wife he'd die for her freely amen amen he would not too many amens but you know it you mean it and brotherly love let's go on is that the end as the end now in the message hear ye him paragraph 61 I hope you can find out we're making a journey with these quotes I spent a lot of time lining these up I know it's a bunch of them that's all right I couldn't add much to this paragraph 61 here you him Klamath Falls you know what happened then when that boy became a certain age that boy was adopted into the family he's talking about the the Middle Eastern concept of adoption he said that boy was adopted into the family now what did they do they took him out in a public place put a special robe on him and had a ceremony and all the people that City gathered around and looked and they said looked upon this boy and the father had a ceremony of adoption oh don't miss that he said don't miss this after that son was adopted his name on the checkbook hey was just as good as his daddy's not before not before that's where God's trying to get his church just say to this mountain be moved and it will move Authority sons of God the whole creation's groaning waiting from the manifestation of the sons of God wading to a spot to where that sickness will be arise and it will be that way the blind will receive their sight he's prophesying the deaf and dumb we pray for them now we pray for them now we pray for them now but then you'll commanded that's the authority of a son your name on the checkbook is as good as papa's name on the checkbook that's why we're pressing toward this perfection in Christ these signs shall follow them that believe they shall pray for the sick he said the cast out Devil's not I will they will if you say to this mountain not if I say if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt it in your heart what we need is adoption Sons and Daughters needs adoption you cannot have adoption until you prove yourself you can't prove yourself until you're tested and tried you can't be tested and tried until God's hand is on you he'd never send you to testing trials without putting his hand on you because he's the one that decides when the enemy has gone far enough let me tell you something the enemy is a tool in his hand and when he when he says that's it that's enough when you and I say the right thing one of these days he said to Jimmy Gillette is that right they tell me that he said it to brother Barker also is anybody don't you know don't you remember the name Jimmy Gillette does that sound yes it's Jimmy Gillette I met him he was in a wheelchair he may still be alive he was still alive a few years back but he may be going on now but his testimony was that brother Branham said to him I remember his wife used to take him around and he sung and he sung from the wheelchair and he said that brother Branham said to him one day Jimmy one of these days you'll say the right word and you'll come out of that wheelchair somebody said well I don't aren't you going to tell us the restaurant I don't know the rest of the story if he's still here he still has the potential of that coming completely to pass in his life if he's there it already has but let me tell you something I don't believe that that I heard that by mistake I I believe it's a message to me I believe it's a message to you I believe I can say to you that one of these days in the midst of your fiery furnace one of these days in the midst of your trial you'll rise up and say the right word and when you do you'll recognize who you are and you'll say to the mountain get out of my way I think we look at that scripture as so something that could possibly happen we need to look at that as something that will happen in our lives but not without a test well we're getting that down pat now we've got to keep walking through that until we speak the right word and let me just tell you this if you're looking this way Nobody Knows the Trouble I've seen that's not going to be the right word singing along with a hound dog ain't nobody been through what I've been through ain't nobody's bruised as big as mine ain't nobody's scar as big as mine ain't nobody been through as much as I have nobody's had a childhood like I've had nobody suffered like I've suffered I said to a couple of folks a few Sundays that go out there in the vestibule was standing there in so much pain after preaching I thought I'm going to collapse and I said to a couple people who stopped about seven feet short of me for me to walk over and shake their hand I said to them no you come to me and I didn't do that to be rude I did that because people have this tendency to think that nobody is in the shape they're in well I want you to know some folks are just as bad off as you are they just wear it better than you do some people don't tell the world about it there are people in here that go through great trials and never make one post one of these days let me tell you something it doesn't matter who's going through what what matters is when we realize that we're not going to be lifted up out of that with authority by singing a sad song we're gonna have to learn to dance in the flood we're going to have to be willing just to let God be glorified in all things Hallelujah and remember I've taught you not Hallelujah anyhow it ain't no Hallelujah anyhow because that's just like any old praise it's not a Hallelujah anyhow it's Hallelujah because Hallelujah because you are still God in the midst of my heartache in the midst of my loss in the middle of my pain you are still God it's intentional praise Hallelujah we're nearly done we pray for them now but one day you'll command it paragraph 62 but how can the church the Pentecostal Church the Methodist Church and the Baptist Churches be adopted until they come to discipline we've got to be disciplined first God could not trust this power with the church it's hard to tell what you would do I've always known this about the spoken word I've known that we wouldn't go to the hard cases first we'd try to exercise it on our enemies foreign I can just see church folks I've been to church with just trying to put a wart on somebody's nose make her uglier than she is Lord you're not going to use this Authority for your personal Vendetta you're not going to use this authority to call something down on somebody else you're going to use this authority to do what the will of God is the church has got to come to a place where it's disciplined God's on that work right now he said he could he could How could a father trust his business with a boy that might simply pollute his whole inheritance he couldn't do it the church has got to come to a place to where it's discipline God's on that work right now Hallelujah God's on that work right now discipline now in that moment we're nearly done musicians coming in that moment when you have fallen short I I had you to raise your hand look to be like it just about everybody it's good to know that we're not alone entertain the thought spoke a word did something you knew better than to do vindictive judgmental we couldn't even come to worship this morning if that's what we would have thought about if that becomes the focus of our mindset when we wake up on a Sunday morning we won't do God any good we won't do ourselves any good we got to learn how to break that each and every time the enemy comes to condemn you for your sin let's just let's just call it because it's an expression of unbelief when we do the things we know we shouldn't do here's what I want you to remember in the message job paragraph 24. he just started off with something good this time paragraph 24. he said that's the way it is today we guilty unworthy should die we're not worthy of living we're not worthy to come to Christ we're not worthy to ask anything but God never looks got a pen in here who has a pen in your hand Bethany write it write it on your paper God no no start with but but God never looks at your unworthiness who else is writing it let me see your hand for writing it write it if you've got a pen write it your brain will remember it longer if you write it and say it like sister Weems teaches us memory challenged people say it out loud when you're getting ready to go into a room to get something so when you get there you'll remember what you're going to get say it out loud the world calls it talking to yourself you just talk to angels tell the angels do whatever you have to do say it out loud but God never looks at your unworthiness semicolon he looked right it borrow loan your pen to somebody write it Aaron you ought to be I mean uh yeah no what is your name Ian you ought to be writing it you got it I see your PIN now ride it he looked at the lamb if God never looks at your unworthiness do you think he wants you looking at it all the time I don't think so that's why I'm not going to Crone up here singing old song we used to sing unworthy in bondage and alone until you until you get to the good stuff which usually not the emphasis of the song but it should be but he made me Worthy and now by [Music] sea hath made me his own but God never looks at your unworthiness he looked at the lamb did you get it wrote he looked at the lamb somebody said I don't have to write it down I can remember it are you kidding who are you kidding you can't remember what time church starts but God never looked at your unworthiness [Music] I got tickled at brother man's tickle he got tickled at me and it tickled me he looked at the lamb now if he can't find no fault in Christ who is your lamb Allelujah and if the father looks at the lamb and can't find any spot in him he's not looking at the unworthiness of the worshiper he's looking at the worthiness of the offering hallelujah hallelujah that is not an excuse for us to live like devils but it says that when we try when we have the desire to do what's right and we stumble in our ways we have a lamb we have an offering we have a Christ that's always Worthy he said that's the way it is today we uh go did we finish that you say ah he died in your Stead now if there's any fault with him you're not free yet maybe you ought to write this down but God don't examine you he didn't have to he told us to examine ourselves he examines the lamb but God don't examine you semicolon he examines the lamb or colon which is it semicolon here I was pretend like I knew something and then all of a sudden I wasn't sure but God don't examine you he examines the lamb you say I'm not worthy to walk out of this wheelchair tonight that's right you're not but God don't examine you he examined Christ and if he's worthy then you can walk say it your friend free now here's where it gets really really powerful he said God can't see you why because he's placed the lamb between he and you that's a thinking man's filter he's placed the blood there oh he could push the blood aside but he put it there he would never take that away he put it there for this for this job he sees the lamb dies in your stead that's enough to make a fellow shout isn't it sure is when you think that upon the basis of the word now that's where we're talking we're on the basis of the word and then Revelation chapter four number three paragraph 119 the preachers called to preach yes and to live it too if you can't live it then you stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your sermons that's right that's right brother Shelley you've got to live it all right here was voices oh how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of we got voices we need lived voices we need voices who have found the life and I want you to listen at what he calls it this is so powerful and it might be a key to understanding what the Thunders will accomplish he said we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and holiness purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians would you read that to me that's that's thunder against the enemy you heard it didn't you it's powerful the devil don't care how loud you can holler never don't care how much you jump or how much you can this or that shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God how can you possibly do that because the lamb is crying out on your behalf and you're just learning to surrender more and more and more and more and more to your offering to your sacrifice he said say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that's the Thunder that shakes the devil when you do not respond they call you all kinds of names some criticize us if we speak in tongues some criticize us if we don't some criticize if we have drums and some would criticize if the music dragged you're never going to please this bunch of people come on folks you've got to learn to take that as sweet as you can God help me and move right on my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil just like will you say if he could preach like a Billy Graham or an Oral Roberts or somebody great influential influential speaker oh no sometimes the devil just laughs at that he don't pay no attention to that thing then to that than nothing you get all the theology you wanted and all the Seminary training and the devil just sits back and laughs at that but when he sees that life Lord let your life be produced in me Hallelujah let's stand foreign I want to close while you're standing if you're able if you're like me you've been sitting that long standing it's not always easier the seat is not air with the shook I want to pray I've done this before for this body I wanted it again I want to read a prayer that brother Branham prayed over the people that were gathered there that night to hear the seed is not air with a shook February the 18th 1965 he said remember I want you all to play something soft I don't know if you want to have her to play the song that you're going to sing or what but I want this to already in fact I'm going to invite you to come how many will come and stand with me before we go home today I'm assuming the restaurants are closed and you've got a can of something waiting on you when you get home or you've made some preparation for lunch before we go I would like to pray this prayer I'd like to read this prayer over your life paragraph 169 brother Brandon said remember I'm giving you the food of the eagle the promise of God he calls His prophets Eagles he calls himself a eagle he is Jehovah eagle and while you have your hands laid upon one another pray for them Let's Do It Let's Do It Let's Not Be invasive but just put your hand on a shoulder an armor hold a hand of a someone of like like gender if you're close to your husband or family our heavenly father your word said the last commission you give to your church was go into all the world and preach the gospel the general orders he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues if they should drink any deadly thing it wouldn't hurt them if they take up serpents they'll not harm them and if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover little ones tonight upon that word lord they're needy that's the diet they need that's what they need to know what the food is what thus saith the Lord is you promised if they'd laid their hands on one another that they would recover oh Lord God take all doubts and vote your ideas away from us now and we feed solemnly upon the eagle food of the word of God and I want you to respond to this part of the prayers powerful let every clean that's in these people every Spirit of doubting every spirit of fear every denominational cling every habit every sickness every disease that's among the people leave in the name of Jesus Christ may it come out of this group of people and may they be free from this hour on that they can eat the eagle food that we're believing you'll send us through the week Lord breaking open those seals and showing us those Mysteries that's been hid since the foundation of the world as you promised they are yours father in the name of Jesus Christ amen and then brother Branham says all that believe and accept stand to your feet say I believe I accept that what God promised me I receive and then he said the Lord bless you that's wonderful every person standing that's good father we thank you for that prayer and we believe that it has Effectiveness today just like it did
