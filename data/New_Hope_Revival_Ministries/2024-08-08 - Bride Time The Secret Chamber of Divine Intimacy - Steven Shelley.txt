TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this is bride time this isn't time to go back to the systems of the church this isn't the time to bow to the denominational spirits of the Antichrist this is the the hour and the time to stand on the word and here's where we won't be able to fudge anymore you won't be able to grab a hold of the coattail of somebody else's Revelation and stand against the Ws of the devil you'll have to be alone with God until he opens up the heaven and releases Revelation to your life and then when you hear Revelation from the spirit based on the absolute word of God that Revelation becomes a part of your DNA the devil can talk you out of having picking someone else's conviction but he'll never talk you out of what the Holy Ghost has revealed to you by the word because it has become a part of of you you have become a part of it and once that word is quickened to you in Soul and Spirit in the Inner Man you receive like Moses a transformation from relating to God as only a master and we his slaves you begin to relate to him as one who has invited you to cooperate with his ET Eternal plan he didn't just create you to serve him and when we think of serving the lord we often think of subservient and less than and not nearly enough and we have to uh hope and and work to get somewhere else God doesn't want to reveal himself to you like that he wants you to know that he could have chosen to call anybody that has ever lived on the face of the Earth he could have chosen them all if he would have desired to he could have left you out of your family when he was choosing but he cared about you before you were ever born he knew your name before your mother and father ever had manifestation on the earth he already knew your name he already knew where you would be just like he knew where Moses was going to be he didn't come down looking for him he came down to meet him when you receive the revelation of the Quicken word for the hour you receive the beginning of a Transfiguration the beginning of a transformation on the inside that works its way through to the outside and he no longer desires to be IM Emmanuel a a god with us but his ultimate desire from the beginning yes not an afterthought from the beginning his ultimate desire was to come down and live in you to walk in you you ought to be careful what you say you ought to be careful what you think you ought to be careful where you go because you're dragging Elohim y v not only the God and creator of the Heaven and Earth but The God Who longs to have intimate fellowship with you you're dragging him to those places you're submitting him to those thoughts you're exposing him to those words and to those behaviors and to those actions somebody said are you trying to strike fear in their heart no Godly conviction and reverence there is an absence of the fear of the Lord in this hour you can't Wade through the Slime and the swamp of this life and expect to be transformed into Oneness with Christ you're going to have to find the secret chamber you're going to have to find the Hoopa you're going to have to find the bridal chamber you're going to have to find the little room inside the tent the tent in the tent on you're going to have to find that little chamber where you go in one way and you come out Ms Jesus Christ and you operate in the authority of that name and that name is so powerful that it transformed Moses Hallelujah and he's one of the only prophets in the bible mentioned as being like unto Christ Moses was a perfect type of the Christ to come now how could he be that he could only be that because of what he received in the revelation of the name and the presence of almighty God he said I want to be to you the yod V I want to be to you the Yahweh the god who desires Union and Oneness and fellowship
