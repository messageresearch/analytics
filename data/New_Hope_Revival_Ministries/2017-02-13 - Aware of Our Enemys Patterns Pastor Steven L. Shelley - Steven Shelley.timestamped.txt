[0:00] if we are without knowledge and
[0:05] understanding of the enemy's devices he
[0:09] will take the advantage of us the only
[0:13] thing the enemy can do or use against
[0:16] you is to find something that will
[0:19] strike your mind if you know it's him if
[0:23] you know it's the devil and you know
[0:26] that's the venue that he uses to attack
[0:29] you in this hour and you know that
[0:31] thought
[0:32] it's nothing in the world but a missile
[0:34] from Satan's attempt to dissuade you and
[0:39] you know that if you know it if you're
[0:41] aware of it in that moment and you don't
[0:44] immediately do something to stop him at
[0:46] the pass it's not just carelessness it's
[0:51] not just being too busy with life
[0:53] stresses its unbelief are you trying to
[0:56] make us feel bad this morning for every
[0:58] time that Satan has got an advantage
[1:00] over us
[1:01] not at all no one could feel any worse
[1:03] than I do for all the times that he has
[1:07] taken advantage of me while I stood back
[1:10] and knew what to do but failed to do it
[1:13] so we share in the misery this morning
[1:16] but here's what we have to say about
[1:18] everything that troubles us that was
[1:21] then that was then this is now
[1:26] we got to be Watchmen this morning we've
[1:29] got to watch in every area of our lives
[1:31] and we've got to be ahead one step ahead
[1:33] and the only way you could be one step
[1:35] ahead of the enemy is watch where he's
[1:37] been remember what he has said know his
[1:41] patterns I tell you you've got the
[1:44] advantage over your enemy when you know
[1:45] his pattern
[1:47] so in other words we not only have to
[1:50] recognize what the enemy is doing and
[1:53] the lie that he's trying to tell we have
[1:55] to examine our hearts this morning and
[1:57] find the stronghold because it's those
[2:00] strongholds that have not yet been cut
[2:03] down to to the root and the root dug out
[2:07] we've got to dig every bit of that
[2:09] foundation up so that when the enemy
[2:12] launches that arrow against us the next
[2:14] time there's nothing there for him to
[2:16] build on there's nothing in us that is
[2:18] attracted to any part of Satan's lie and
[2:22] because we are not ignorant of his
[2:24] devices anything anything any
[2:27] personality traits anything you carry
[2:30] that hinders you from being all that God
[2:33] has called you to be is a lie and it is
[2:35] not of God and it is not who you really
[2:39] are so don't you use some of these
[2:43] things and say well God made me that way
[2:45] that's a lie
[2:46] and it's so much lie that you cannot
[2:49] engage that lie any longer because when
[2:53] the Holy Ghost comes in to live you now
[2:56] have fire and life and truth living
[3:00] inside of you that can transform
[3:03] recreate you back to the image of
[3:07] everything that God intended to do for
[3:11] you and through you in the beginning and
[3:14] he's waiting on somebody to be an
[3:18] instrument
[3:19] to be a gate to be a door so that he can
[3:25] step through he lives right here he just
[3:27] steps right through you into the earth
[3:29] he did it through a POW he did it
[3:32] through a Peter neither of which were
[3:37] flawless
