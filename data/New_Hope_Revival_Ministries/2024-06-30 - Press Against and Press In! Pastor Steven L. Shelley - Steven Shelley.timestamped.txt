[44:24] sister Anna Christine is coming to sing
[44:27] while she's coming and getting ready we
[44:29] want to receive the tithe and offering
[44:33] today just uh uh small report the the
[44:39] work under the Tabernacle is at somewhat
[44:42] of a stand still because the air
[44:46] conditioner lines need to be put in the
[44:48] walls and so forth before that we can
[44:50] move forward with sheetrocking anything
[44:52] insulating anything and so it's just
[44:54] kind of at a standstill um right now
[44:57] there's right around $113,000 in the
[45:00] account and we need somewhere around 24
[45:03] 25,000 to get the air conditioning
[45:05] systems in I know that the Lord has that
[45:09] and I know that he will provide it I've
[45:12] seen him already doing it this week
[45:14] we're thankful for every offering that
[45:16] comes in uh some of you may not have
[45:19] heard but there was somewhat of a
[45:21] catastrophe at my house this week uh
[45:24] while we were away and uh
[45:27] uh it it it's amazing how God does work
[45:31] my wife bought some cherries for Shana
[45:35] set them on the countertop and told
[45:36] Nathan to go get them he forgot to do it
[45:39] on Wednesday and went in on Thursday and
[45:42] was met by a
[45:44] flood the filter under my sink the
[45:47] reverse osmosis filter one of the
[45:49] canisters broke and water was going
[45:52] everywhere he pumped out about 90
[45:54] gallons of water I have a pump in under
[45:58] the floor it's hard to tell how much it
[46:00] pumped out uh and so uh our kitchen is
[46:04] is a wreck right now but uh I I'm not at
[46:10] odds about it Joyce is not upset about
[46:13] it she said for about five seconds she
[46:16] was startled dismayed but the Peace of
[46:20] the Lord settled down over us he knows
[46:23] what he's doing and I'm just uh excited
[46:28] to watch how he wants to work and so I
[46:31] just keep moving forward giving him
[46:33] praise and that's what he deserves he
[46:37] deserves the praise he's the one that
[46:39] gave me the house to start with he gave
[46:42] me the grace to pay the mortgage off in
[46:45] 2015 he gives me the money to pay the
[46:47] insurance so that I can call up Alpha
[46:50] Insurance and say I need some help he's
[46:53] the one that gives us all that ability
[46:56] and so I just give him the praise today
[46:58] I'm not going to W withhold my tithe or
[47:01] my offering because he has all that I
[47:04] have need
[47:06] of that's who he is so brother ellias
[47:10] and brother Austin uh Yantis will you

[1:00:16] anniversary today I think they're going

[1:00:21] believe they're going to make
[1:00:23] it happy anniversary
[1:00:28] I can tell you right now my week coming
[1:00:31] up is going to look a whole lot
[1:00:33] different than my week has looked for
[1:00:36] the last five weeks tomorrow she'll be
[1:00:39] six weeks old I think and I have spent
[1:00:42] at least a portion of every day holding
[1:00:45] her and her Nana has spent a portion of
[1:00:48] the day holding her praying over her and
[1:00:52] uh I've tried to be faithful to tell her
[1:00:54] every day that Jesus loves her and I
[1:00:57] just go down the list and I always get
[1:01:00] Jenna's mom and dad in there too grahams
[1:01:03] and Chief and and as uh sad as I'm going
[1:01:07] to be not having them around this week I
[1:01:10] am that much thrilled for her parents
[1:01:14] and her
[1:01:15] grandparents that they're going to get
[1:01:17] to see her and enjoy her this week
[1:01:21] Jenna's grandfather is 91 will he be 90
[1:01:26] 91 I think this year grandmother is 80
[1:01:29] or 81 and they're coming they're going
[1:01:32] to pick them up and bringing them from
[1:01:34] Arkansas to Dallas and the family's
[1:01:37] going to be together and they deserve
[1:01:39] their they deserve their chance and
[1:01:42] their opportuni so I feel like sharing
[1:01:44] right now maybe about Wednesday I may
[1:01:47] not feel like sharing but it is what it
[1:01:50] is may God give them safety as they as
[1:01:53] they travel I think that was all for
[1:01:57] today uh tomorrow is uh a a birthday
[1:02:01] that I remember every year uh it is the
[1:02:04] birthday of a mentor of mine an example
[1:02:09] to me in
[1:02:10] Ministry uh who has gone to be with the
[1:02:12] Lord some many years ago now but brother
[1:02:16] Perry green was born in uh 33 I think it
[1:02:20] was on July the 1st and he would have
[1:02:24] been 91 I think 9 1 years old if he
[1:02:27] would have still been with us and I
[1:02:30] usually remember it make a little post
[1:02:32] or something and I remember something
[1:02:35] brother brandham said to him personally
[1:02:38] many years ago in about 64 or five he
[1:02:42] said brother Perry that n that one in
[1:02:45] your birthday July 1st that one in your
[1:02:50] birthday means that you're good at
[1:02:52] starting things and you know brother
[1:02:55] green never forgot that and so uh when
[1:02:59] it came time to start the work in Tucson
[1:03:01] he was utilizing that one in his
[1:03:04] birthday and he liked to mention that to
[1:03:07] us so many times and I can't forget it
[1:03:10] Tuesday is sister Mimi I mean alita's
[1:03:14] birthday she's Mimi to a lot of us hold
[1:03:17] up your hand there's some that might not
[1:03:19] know who you are let's say happy
[1:03:21] birthday to Sister Alita
[1:03:28] she's a few years older than she was
[1:03:30] when I first met her many years ago but
[1:03:33] I would have to say that she is crowned
[1:03:35] with glory and beauty and she gets
[1:03:39] around and labors and drives a school
[1:03:42] bus and uh she doesn't act her
[1:03:46] age you know that's the truth and and
[1:03:48] it's a blessing from the Lord to be in
[1:03:50] that position so we love her and we wish
[1:03:53] her happy birthday sister Jeffrey you
[1:03:56] don't you don't I mean you're a little
[1:03:58] younger there than but you don't act
[1:04:01] your age either and you certainly don't
[1:04:03] look your age and um I say that because
[1:04:06] I've known both of you ladies a long
[1:04:08] time hold up your hands so everybody can
[1:04:10] see Tuesday is also sister jeffy's
[1:04:12] birthday and we want to say God bless

[1:04:23] the birthday of our nation so to speak
[1:04:26] and sister Beverly shares uh a birthday
[1:04:30] not the
[1:04:34] year not
[1:04:38] 1776 than I don't know that'd be kind of
[1:04:41] a miracle wouldn't it God's able to do a
[1:04:44] lot of things so she's not she certainly
[1:04:47] doesn't share the year but she does
[1:04:49] share the day uh sister Beverly

[1:06:12] Africa and it just goes on South Africa
[1:06:16] God bless you all you can't be here with
[1:06:18] us physically but we're thankful that
[1:06:20] you're connected with us through the
[1:06:23] internet we have been doing that so long
[1:06:26] we we out we predate the
[1:06:29] internet uh that's the truth and we used
[1:06:32] to do it with a telephone hookup and
[1:06:35] people would call in and brother brother
[1:06:37] Wallace had these little boxes and maybe
[1:06:39] brother Williams might have helped on
[1:06:41] some of that we had these little boxes
[1:06:43] that you flip flip a switch and maybe
[1:06:46] brother TBO was it brother TBO that did
[1:06:48] something in that too so that we could
[1:06:50] put people on hold but instead of
[1:06:52] putting them on hold they got to hear
[1:06:54] what was going on in the service and we
[1:06:56] did that for many years until the
[1:06:58] internet began to open up and now we
[1:07:01] have the blessing of being able to
[1:07:03] stream anywhere that someone can get a
[1:07:05] signal and we hear back we hear every
[1:07:07] week from people who are blessed and
[1:07:10] touched and helped and we want to give
[1:07:11] the go the glory to God it doesn't
[1:07:14] belong to us let's stand and while we're
[1:07:17] standing let's thank the Lord for these
[1:07:20] amazing musicians and Benjamin leading
[1:07:23] the worship and oh we just appreciate
[1:07:30] it we want to believe God to move in
[1:07:33] Indiana May the Lord just move and use
[1:07:37] brother gy and if if things were a
[1:07:39] little different we'd all just shut this
[1:07:41] place down Sunday and we'd all go and
[1:07:45] because those people have been so
[1:07:47] faithful to fellowship with us these
[1:07:50] last three or so years maybe going on
[1:07:53] four now I don't remember exactly and
[1:07:55] they come by the droves and uh this is
[1:07:59] this is an opportunity and some of the
[1:08:01] folks are going to go and we're going to
[1:08:03] miss you it's going to be a little
[1:08:04] little emptier here next Sunday we had
[1:08:06] to kind of work around because we got
[1:08:09] musicians leaving and worship leaders
[1:08:11] leaving and so forth but you know the
[1:08:13] Lord will be here and if you're in town
[1:08:16] please be here and bring your biggest
[1:08:18] amen and help us move through amen all
[1:08:22] right let's look to the word of God
[1:08:24] today we'll just let you uh uh keep
[1:08:26] standing for a moment and then uh you
[1:08:30] can have your seat let's go to
[1:08:34] Philippians that's in the New
[1:08:38] Testament chapter 3 Philippians 3 and
[1:08:42] I'm just going to read for now seven
[1:08:46] verses my message this morning is a
[1:08:49] continuation of where we were uh Sunday
[1:08:53] morning and Tuesday night we call that
[1:08:56] oh yes you can and you can because
[1:09:00] greater is he that is in you it's not me
[1:09:04] that's great it's the one who lives in
[1:09:06] me that's great amen and that makes me
[1:09:08] an overcomer certainly does and this
[1:09:12] morning I'm going to take it a step
[1:09:14] further and the message would be called
[1:09:16] press against and press in we're
[1:09:21] pressing this is a pressing hour the
[1:09:24] Bible talks about an age when we would
[1:09:26] be pressed on every hand and the
[1:09:30] pressure of life around us and politics
[1:09:34] and you know sickness and whatever else
[1:09:38] is kind of pressing in family
[1:09:41] responsibilities Etc sort of press in
[1:09:44] and if you don't press
[1:09:46] back you'll you'll
[1:09:48] implode if you just lay there and let
[1:09:51] life walk all over you without calling
[1:09:54] on your help
[1:09:55] you see I know where my help comes from
[1:09:58] and I will lift like the I'll lift my
[1:10:01] eyes toward the Hills from which cometh
[1:10:04] my help my help comes from the Lord my
[1:10:07] Creator my maker amen if you don't press
[1:10:11] back you'll implode and so there's
[1:10:15] something that we press against and
[1:10:17] there's something that we press into and
[1:10:20] we've got to do it at the same
[1:10:23] time there there's no time to do one and
[1:10:26] then the other we have to do both at the
[1:10:28] same time we're pressing the darkness
[1:10:31] back and we're pressing into to the
[1:10:33] promise amen Philippians 3 but what
[1:10:37] things were gained to me those I counted
[1:10:43] loss for Christ yay doubtless and I
[1:10:47] count all things but loss for the
[1:10:52] Excellency of the knowledge of Christ
[1:10:56] Jesus my Lord I want to pause and remind
[1:11:00] you that this knowledge is not a head
[1:11:03] knowing it's not a head knowledge it's a
[1:11:07] relational knowledge you only gain the
[1:11:10] knowledge of Christ Jesus as Lord by
[1:11:13] having fellowship and relationship with
[1:11:16] him you understand you can hear all the
[1:11:19] good preaching and you can hear all the
[1:11:22] good things about him and be very
[1:11:24] acquainted with him in in in head
[1:11:27] knowledge in information but by
[1:11:30] Revelation is how we gain this kind of a
[1:11:33] knowledge it comes by having some
[1:11:37] participation and as the New Testament
[1:11:39] says cooperation with him so this
[1:11:43] knowledge is worth
[1:11:45] pursuing the Apostle said for whom I
[1:11:48] have suffered the loss of all things and
[1:11:52] do count them but dung
[1:11:55] that I may win Christ the the whole life
[1:12:00] of the apostle was changed when he met
[1:12:04] the Lord and he was most learned among
[1:12:07] the religious and all of his religion he
[1:12:10] had to lay aside to have a relationship
[1:12:13] with Jesus Christ he said all that
[1:12:15] training all that effort all that stuff
[1:12:18] I've gone through it's nothing it's just
[1:12:21] loss and listen at this verse and be
[1:12:25] found in
[1:12:27] him not having mine own righteousness
[1:12:30] which is of the law a Pharisee of the
[1:12:33] Pharisees but that which is through the
[1:12:36] Faith of Christ I like it he didn't say
[1:12:40] faith in Christ he said the Faith of
[1:12:45] Christ you think that little small
[1:12:47] preposition doesn't matter it changes
[1:12:49] the whole meaning of the phrase and be
[1:12:52] found in him not having my own
[1:12:55] righteousness which is of the law but
[1:12:58] that which is through the Faith of
[1:13:00] Christ that is an imparted faith that is
[1:13:03] not a faith that you muster yourself
[1:13:06] it's a faith that is given to you
[1:13:08] granted to you it's not faith in Christ
[1:13:12] but it's his faith that's been given to
[1:13:15] you as a gift the righteousness which is
[1:13:19] of god by by faith we can never get good
[1:13:23] enough he said that I
[1:13:26] may know him again not
[1:13:31] information by
[1:13:33] intimacy that I may know him and the
[1:13:36] power of his
[1:13:38] resurrection that I may experience the
[1:13:41] dunamis the dynamite of who he is in his
[1:13:45] resurrection power and the fellowship of
[1:13:50] his sufferings now remember we're
[1:13:53] entering into Fellowship with his
[1:13:55] sufferings because he suffered on our
[1:13:58] behalf being made
[1:14:01] conformable
[1:14:02] moldable pliable unto his death if by
[1:14:09] any
[1:14:10] means I might attain unto the
[1:14:14] resurrection of the Dead a future
[1:14:16] promise not as though I had already
[1:14:19] attained either were already perfect but
[1:14:22] I follow after if if that I may
[1:14:27] apprehend which means to lay hold on
[1:14:30] that for which also I am apprehended of
[1:14:35] Christ Jesus the Apostle is saying that
[1:14:38] I may
[1:14:40] arrest the very force that has arrested
[1:14:44] me come on that I may grab hold of take
[1:14:49] hold of the very thing that has first
[1:14:52] taken hold of me and that that is Christ
[1:14:56] Jesus Oh Hallelujah Brethren I count not
[1:15:00] myself to have apprehended but this one
[1:15:05] thing let's say it one thing one thing
[1:15:10] one thing so many things to do but Paul
[1:15:12] said I count not myself to have
[1:15:15] apprehended but this one thing I do
[1:15:20] hello what's he say next forgetting
[1:15:24] those those things which are behind
[1:15:28] and woo unto those things which are
[1:15:32] before I'm forgetting those things that
[1:15:36] are behind me and I am reaching toward
[1:15:39] those things that are mine they're mine
[1:15:43] they're promised to me and here is the
[1:15:46] last verse
[1:15:47] I press I press toward the Mark it's
[1:15:54] like a
[1:15:55] race we're pressing toward you remember
[1:15:59] get on your
[1:16:00] mark get set go that's the starting Mark
[1:16:04] but there's a finishing Mark how many of
[1:16:06] you know there's an end to this race the
[1:16:09] Apostle said I press toward the mark for
[1:16:12] the
[1:16:13] prize of the High Calling of God in
[1:16:17] Christ Jesus do you know what your prize
[1:16:20] is in
[1:16:22] knowing that you've been called
[1:16:25] by Christ Jesus to be called of him is
[1:16:29] the greatest prize that anybody could
[1:16:32] ever attain and in reality he is the
[1:16:37] prize he is the prize so let's read that
[1:16:40] together before we're seated I press
[1:16:42] toward the mark for the prize of the
[1:16:45] High Calling of God in Christ Jesus
[1:16:49] father we thank you today for your
[1:16:53] presence in this room
[1:16:55] we are here to lift up your name to
[1:16:59] glorify you you are king of kings and
[1:17:03] Lord of lords anoint our ears and our
[1:17:07] hearts to both hear and receive this
[1:17:12] message today let it not be a message
[1:17:15] from from the preacher may it be a
[1:17:18] message from your throne Lord may we
[1:17:21] speak today as with the oracle of God
[1:17:26] speak to your people and encourage your
[1:17:30] people and help us to get back on the
[1:17:33] race if we have in some way stumbled
[1:17:36] From the Path and we'll give you glory
[1:17:39] and honor and praise for it's in the
[1:17:42] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[1:17:45] and the church said amen you may be
[1:17:49] seated now because we're
[1:17:53] continuing this series just a little bit
[1:17:56] we're still talking about taking the
[1:17:59] promised land and we read both Sunday
[1:18:03] and Tuesday night about those spies that
[1:18:07] were called of God leaders from all of
[1:18:10] the 12 tribes of the children of Israel
[1:18:14] one chosen out of every tribe to go and
[1:18:18] represent as
[1:18:20] spies a as uh those who would go before
[1:18:24] for Runners who would go into the land
[1:18:27] of promise and check it out God's
[1:18:30] already said on the other side of that
[1:18:32] river is yours I'm giving you that good
[1:18:35] land but you know nobody wants to to to
[1:18:39] go in and not have any idea what you're
[1:18:41] going to meet once you get over there
[1:18:43] and so this was a brilliant plan uh but
[1:18:47] it didn't go so well in reality because
[1:18:51] 10 came back with gripes
[1:18:55] gripes
[1:18:57] bellyaches and complaints we like to say
[1:19:01] negative reports but what did the Bible
[1:19:03] call it an evil report a and anything
[1:19:07] contrary to God's promise in your life
[1:19:10] is an evil report if the devil accuses
[1:19:13] you or lays something to your charge
[1:19:15] that's against what God's word has said
[1:19:18] about you as a spirit fill believer then
[1:19:20] we know that's not just a negative word
[1:19:22] from hell but it's an evil report
[1:19:25] and he'll talk to your mind won't he and
[1:19:28] he'll make you suspicious of each other
[1:19:31] even that's how he works in the last
[1:19:34] days so 10 came back with gripes and two
[1:19:39] Joshua and Caleb they came back with
[1:19:42] grapes now you got to put yourself in
[1:19:45] there somewhere if you'd have been one
[1:19:47] of those spies wouldn't you like to
[1:19:49] think that you'd have been one of those
[1:19:51] who came back with grapes but kn what
[1:19:55] you know about
[1:20:01] yourself knowing what you know about
[1:20:04] yourself you tell
[1:20:06] me see because how you conduct yourself
[1:20:10] with your own situation now is how you
[1:20:13] would have conducted yourself then and
[1:20:16] if it's easier this is no condemnation
[1:20:18] brother because we're all working to the
[1:20:20] same inheritance pushing oursel so this
[1:20:22] is not to make anybody feel bad it is to
[1:20:25] try to make you check up a little bit
[1:20:27] and make sure that you are believing the
[1:20:30] report of the
[1:20:31] Lord instead of the report of your
[1:20:34] circumstances is that okay so if
[1:20:37] everything that happens to you you know
[1:20:39] you're always looking at the worst side
[1:20:42] worst case scenario you know I I always
[1:20:46] see maybe you see the the glasses half
[1:20:48] empty and someone else comes along and
[1:20:51] says well that glass is half full it's
[1:20:53] the same glass same amount of liquid but
[1:20:56] it matters how you look at things and so
[1:20:59] how you look at your life what you heard
[1:21:01] brother gy share this morning in his own
[1:21:05] testimony about this flood that came to
[1:21:07] their house it hasn't been so many years
[1:21:11] ago on July the 4th that we were
[1:21:14] enjoying a barbecue at our house and we
[1:21:18] had a flood that caused our uh hardwood
[1:21:21] floor to have to be replaced a bathroom
[1:21:23] to be made uh you know redone and so
[1:21:26] forth and Etc and you've been through
[1:21:28] similar kinds of situations ours drug
[1:21:31] out for three years but in the end God
[1:21:33] was glorified and it turned out brother
[1:21:36] gy came almost immediately sister Joyce
[1:21:39] had just a few tiny moments of wow and
[1:21:44] then their their testimony quickly
[1:21:47] became Lord uh you knew this we didn't
[1:21:51] know it was going to happen you knew it
[1:21:52] and you must already have a plan
[1:21:55] somebody needs a
[1:21:57] witness somebody needs to come in our
[1:22:00] home and be witnessed to and uh maybe
[1:22:04] you didn't like the color of the floor
[1:22:06] as good as you thought you did to start
[1:22:07] with or the quality of the product and
[1:22:09] God's making away there's all the all
[1:22:13] these kind so we could look at how
[1:22:16] horrible that is all that water and my
[1:22:20] wife said when she heard she said water
[1:22:23] can be so damaging water the Bible said
[1:22:27] so water it can cause so much damage and
[1:22:31] there's so much to to lament about uh
[1:22:34] when you're when you're looking at
[1:22:36] cabinets and so forth but they decided
[1:22:39] you heard it they decided to say this is
[1:22:43] but an opportunity somewhere in this
[1:22:47] will come out ahead and God will be
[1:22:50] glorified in our
[1:22:52] testimony if you're the that kind of a
[1:22:55] person I I'm not just elevating them but
[1:22:58] I do love them respect their leadership
[1:23:01] and want them to know it but if you're
[1:23:03] that kind of a person you'd have
[1:23:06] probably been one of the
[1:23:08] two that came back with
[1:23:13] grapes but if you're the kind of person
[1:23:15] that sees every
[1:23:17] hardship as a Warfare from hell and
[1:23:21] Satan's trying to kill you
[1:23:24] and it must be a demon at work I mean I
[1:23:28] believe in all those things but if
[1:23:30] that's the first thing you see H then
[1:23:33] you're more likely to bring a report
[1:23:35] that God doesn't get any glory in I want
[1:23:38] to remind you church that our God is
[1:23:41] greater than our
[1:23:42] enemy in every way in every way God's
[1:23:47] word defeats his enemy a and the one
[1:23:50] that has set out to destroy your life is
[1:23:53] already def defeated and if we'll stop
[1:23:56] agreeing with him he has to tuck tail
[1:24:00] the Bible said submit yourselves
[1:24:02] therefore unto God resist the devil and
[1:24:05] you don't have to run from him what's
[1:24:08] the word say he'll flee from you and I
[1:24:12] believe that with all my heart so I
[1:24:15] don't know what you would have done then
[1:24:16] you may not perhaps know but you're
[1:24:19] presented with an opportunity now moving
[1:24:21] forward toward the end of your destiny
[1:24:24] to to make sure that the report you give
[1:24:27] is one that says God is bigger than my
[1:24:31] problem he's bigger than my
[1:24:34] circumstance one of the great uh
[1:24:37] Spurgeon perhaps or or one of the greats
[1:24:41] used to say don't look at the bigness of
[1:24:44] your problem but rather look at the
[1:24:48] bigness of your God it's not easy to do
[1:24:53] that in the Heat of the Moment
[1:24:55] we've all been in those situations but
[1:24:57] when we choose to agree with the Lord in
[1:25:01] his word then we give a good report the
[1:25:03] best we can maybe our voice is trembling
[1:25:07] you know maybe we don't feel very strong
[1:25:09] but we're holding on to faith and giving
[1:25:12] God an opportunity to work don't shut
[1:25:15] God out of your
[1:25:17] circumstances let him in and let him
[1:25:20] have his way to his glory and so uh you
[1:25:24] know it it got serious because in the
[1:25:27] end those 10 couldn't go in and their
[1:25:30] descendants some of their descendant
[1:25:32] weren't allowed to go in in fact a whole
[1:25:35] generation had to die before they could
[1:25:38] really be taken into the inheritance
[1:25:40] that God had promised them so it was
[1:25:42] another trip around the mountain come on
[1:25:45] here comes Kadesh Baria again going to
[1:25:48] see it again and again and again until
[1:25:51] we agree with what the word said then we
[1:25:54] can go straight into the promise it's
[1:25:56] coming it's coming your promise is not
[1:25:59] as far away now as it was
[1:26:02] yesterday every day you wait for it
[1:26:05] every day you T for it in faith brings
[1:26:09] it one day
[1:26:10] closer if you spend the day in
[1:26:14] turmoil without faith you really push
[1:26:17] you push the
[1:26:19] promise you push the promise a little
[1:26:21] further out in the future somebody said
[1:26:24] you do that by your faith and your
[1:26:26] report well according to the word you do
[1:26:28] I'm just telling you what the book said
[1:26:30] so let's get let's get a few quotations
[1:26:32] here that will finish up that part of
[1:26:36] this message in a message called
[1:26:39] Redemption by judgment brother brandom
[1:26:42] is preaching at home and in paragraph
[1:26:46] 27 he says now Israel come up to Kadesh
[1:26:52] or Kadesh Baria and here they come back
[1:26:57] and Joshua and
[1:27:00] Caleb this is paragraph
[1:27:02] 27 of redemption by judgment
[1:27:06] 54 and Joshua and Caleb they were really
[1:27:11] all fired up this is the LA the excuse
[1:27:16] me this is the quotation right after the
[1:27:18] last one that we did on Tuesday evening
[1:27:21] uh Joshua and Caleb they were all fired
[1:27:24] up they must have had a prayer meeting
[1:27:27] over there a Revival of some sort among
[1:27:32] themselves and when they come back
[1:27:35] here's what their report said
[1:27:38] yes yes we can take it now brother
[1:27:42] brandham seemed to think the prayer
[1:27:44] meeting made the difference how many of
[1:27:46] you know it will you okay fellas before
[1:27:49] we go back let us pray a little bit and
[1:27:53] see if we can get leadership on what to
[1:27:56] say I believe that was a good plan I
[1:27:59] believe it' be a good plan in your life
[1:28:02] as well the rest just came back and they
[1:28:05] made up I mean they just exaggerated the
[1:28:07] situation remember they said the land
[1:28:10] swallows up its inhabitants and everyone
[1:28:14] there is a giant that was an
[1:28:16] exaggeration one family of Giants and so
[1:28:19] we have no possibility no chance of
[1:28:23] overcoming them but two little men had a
[1:28:26] prayer meeting on the way back and by
[1:28:28] the time they got there they were
[1:28:30] excited enough to say oh yes it's not
[1:28:33] all pleasant but we can take the land
[1:28:36] and now we don't have to go through
[1:28:38] another 40 years of training we could
[1:28:41] take it right now if we just move in can
[1:28:44] you not find that one all right but the
[1:28:47] other 10 said oh
[1:28:49] no we we can't we can't do that it's
[1:28:54] just too much for us he said see that's
[1:28:57] a lack of faith listen Christian
[1:29:00] everything
[1:29:01] everything everything is based on on
[1:29:06] faith when your faith is not enough he
[1:29:09] has Faith the faith of God the Faith of
[1:29:12] Christ that he'll pour out on you it
[1:29:15] comes as a super sense of faith it comes
[1:29:18] as a gift of faith remember everybody
[1:29:21] has Faith the Bible said to every every
[1:29:24] man is given a Measure of Faith and the
[1:29:27] more you use your faith like a muscle
[1:29:30] the stronger it becomes but there is a
[1:29:33] faith there is another faith that you
[1:29:37] can't work up to I don't care how much
[1:29:40] you use your faith muscle there is a
[1:29:43] faith in God a faith excuse me a faith
[1:29:45] of God a Faith of Christ that he imparts
[1:29:49] to us as a super sense as a gift and
[1:29:53] when that comes I want you to know the
[1:29:55] circumstances they don't matter because
[1:29:58] God said so and that settles it so
[1:30:02] brother brandom said here everything is
[1:30:03] based on faith and faith cannot be right
[1:30:07] unless it's got something to be based on
[1:30:10] you see your faith is not based on
[1:30:12] circumstance your faith is based on the
[1:30:15] inspired word of God Amen you can have
[1:30:19] faith and say well I believe that this
[1:30:21] is my belief
[1:30:24] you ever been that wishy-washy well you
[1:30:26] know I believe that God can you know I
[1:30:28] don't know if he will or not I'm not
[1:30:30] sure what God will I don't know but you
[1:30:33] know I I just have some thought I mean
[1:30:35] this thought comes to my mind that maybe
[1:30:37] maybe God will help me come on that's
[1:30:39] not the kind of Faith it's going to take
[1:30:41] to get through the Giants and get to the
[1:30:44] promise we're going to have to have more
[1:30:46] than a hope so we're going to have to
[1:30:49] have a noo and the only way to have that
[1:30:51] is a Believers to receive the fullness
[1:30:53] of the bap ISM of the Holy Ghost when
[1:30:55] the fullness of the holy spirit is yours
[1:30:58] it anoints everything you got it's
[1:31:02] supercharges everything you've got so
[1:31:04] it's not enough to say well I believe
[1:31:06] that this is my belief my belief is no
[1:31:09] good if it's contrary to God's belief
[1:31:13] there's something more important than my
[1:31:15] belief but if my belief
[1:31:19] tallies if it measures up lines up with
[1:31:23] his then I got a foundation that is
[1:31:26] solid no matter what takes place we're
[1:31:29] just going to go anyhow cause
[1:31:34] God you believe the Lord will help you
[1:31:37] cuz God said so do you believe he's able
[1:31:40] to touch and help your body cuz God said
[1:31:44] so he's able now that's the type of
[1:31:47] faith that Caleb and Joshua had the
[1:31:52] kindest base on a solid foundation now
[1:31:56] in the message the Easter seal uh
[1:31:59] paragraph 171 and forgive me for so many
[1:32:02] references this morning men and women
[1:32:05] it'll take you uh uh it'll make you
[1:32:08] stand to your feet it'll make you do the
[1:32:11] things that God wants you to do I don't
[1:32:14] care what somebody else says about it
[1:32:17] the neighbor said oh that person has
[1:32:19] lost their mind pray all night read the
[1:32:22] Bible you you do realize you're
[1:32:24] surrounded by people who think you're
[1:32:27] crazy there's people watching this
[1:32:30] service right now by chance it seems
[1:32:33] they didn't plan to be watching it and
[1:32:36] they're looking around and they're
[1:32:38] thinking that's a craziest bunch of
[1:32:39] people waving their hands and and and
[1:32:43] and jumping around like a war dance and
[1:32:46] somebody's waving a flag or something in
[1:32:48] there those people are off their rocker
[1:32:51] I I think it's good for you to know how
[1:32:53] people look at you you is that going to
[1:32:55] discourage you are you going to come in
[1:32:57] here Tuesday night with your hands
[1:32:58] folded sir no sir we're going to come in
[1:33:01] praising God because the Bible tells us
[1:33:04] how to praise him so I don't care what
[1:33:08] they say it's what God called you to do
[1:33:10] that's right oh they say we can't have
[1:33:12] these oldfashioned Pentecostal
[1:33:15] revivals oh
[1:33:19] oh oh yes we can too
[1:33:26] hello you can have
[1:33:28] it it doesn't matter whether your church
[1:33:31] is having one or not you can have one in
[1:33:35] yourself remember when the spies went
[1:33:38] over to the United Kingdom to see what
[1:33:40] was going on in in in the excuse me in
[1:33:44] Wales during the Welch Revival where The
[1:33:47] Jeffy brothers were were ministering and
[1:33:50] they couldn't find their way you know
[1:33:52] they've been on a boat for for we don't
[1:33:54] know how long they finally get there
[1:33:56] they don't know where Wales is they're
[1:33:58] trying to find it somewhere in London
[1:34:00] looking for Wales which is uh a pretty
[1:34:03] piece on down the road to the South and
[1:34:07] they they come across a police officer
[1:34:09] what they call a Bobby and he's standing
[1:34:11] on a little platform in the in the
[1:34:13] intersection of the road with a whistle
[1:34:15] you know and he's directing traffic they
[1:34:18] walk right out in the street and said
[1:34:20] excuse me sir can you tell us where the
[1:34:23] wel Revival is we've come from America
[1:34:26] to experience the Welsh Revival he said
[1:34:29] oh that's easy it's right
[1:34:33] here I can give you directions to Wales
[1:34:38] and you can experience what I've
[1:34:40] experienced there but if you're looking
[1:34:42] for the Revival it's standing right here
[1:34:45] before you I believe that I believe that
[1:34:49] Revival is a personal individual
[1:34:53] experience with the Lord and you ought
[1:34:55] to be having
[1:34:56] Revival if everybody around you is
[1:35:00] licking their wounds and eating
[1:35:02] worms you ought to be having a Revival
[1:35:06] why because God's word gives us the
[1:35:09] right he never fails oh yes we can too
[1:35:14] you can have it in yourself and you are
[1:35:19] the have you ever felt alone have you
[1:35:22] ever felt like you you were a lone ship
[1:35:25] in the middle of a big sea and nobody
[1:35:29] even knew where you were and you've been
[1:35:32] lost for ages and nobody has even come
[1:35:35] looking for you and the motor is
[1:35:40] gone and the boat is a drift
[1:35:44] hello oh and you're in the minority by
[1:35:48] yourself like Elijah the prophet when he
[1:35:51] would run in from a woman named
[1:35:54] Jezebel you ever felt that way didn't
[1:35:57] you realize friend that with God in God
[1:36:01] you are not a minority you are never
[1:36:05] alone when you're in God when you're in
[1:36:08] Christ let me tell you about that being
[1:36:11] alone you can be in a crowded room and
[1:36:14] be alone so we're not looking just for
[1:36:17] for companionship or Fellowship we're
[1:36:21] looking for the reality that we are a
[1:36:24] majority when we stand in God when we
[1:36:28] stand on the word we're not a shrinking
[1:36:32] minority one God the Old Church of God
[1:36:34] hymn one God and
[1:36:39] man I think the words were probably one
[1:36:42] man and God but I like the other way
[1:36:45] around one God and man can Triumph or a
[1:36:51] thousand one God in man put Satan on the
[1:36:55] run one woman and God is a majority not
[1:36:59] a minority no matter what the rest of
[1:37:02] them think we're not even asking anybody
[1:37:05] else whether they think we can make it
[1:37:06] or not we're not even asking anybody
[1:37:09] else if they think that we can come all
[1:37:10] the way to full adoption and sunship
[1:37:13] doesn't matter what you
[1:37:16] think anybody with
[1:37:18] me oh no matter what the rest of them
[1:37:21] think then he goes on in wisdom versus
[1:37:23] faith and he says then if Jesus defeated
[1:37:27] Satan upon the faith knowing who he was
[1:37:31] he was a predestinated creature are you
[1:37:34] ready amen the congregation said amen he
[1:37:37] said what about the
[1:37:39] predestinated Bride of Jesus Christ now
[1:37:44] now today the word predestination has
[1:37:47] become a curse word in the in the modern
[1:37:50] Church World especially in the modern
[1:37:52] Pentecostal Church world they're they're
[1:37:55] so scared of it because all that's ever
[1:37:57] been presented to many of them is an
[1:37:59] extreme form of predestination like the
[1:38:03] Primitive Baptist used to preach if a
[1:38:05] man goes out and takes a a gun and and
[1:38:09] puts a bullet in another man's head they
[1:38:11] said Lord well he was predestinated to
[1:38:14] do that now that's wrong that's not what
[1:38:18] the book said we're not talking about
[1:38:21] predestinated to do evil things
[1:38:24] although there is some reality to that
[1:38:27] because if you don't make the right
[1:38:29] choice that's right you don't make the
[1:38:32] how many of you glad you made God your
[1:38:34] choice and evidently you did it in
[1:38:37] eternity because the Bible said uh you
[1:38:40] didn't choose
[1:38:42] me before you could ever choose me I saw
[1:38:46] your choice and i cho by my for
[1:38:49] knowledge I saw your choice and I chose
[1:38:52] you that's what the word said he said
[1:38:55] what about the predestinated Bride of
[1:38:57] Jesus Christ now you believe the bride
[1:38:59] is predestined I sure do I sure do
[1:39:01] believe it the predestinated bride of
[1:39:04] Christ now the church the word seed with
[1:39:07] everything that God promised to put in
[1:39:10] the
[1:39:11] church
[1:39:15] what after the next fellowship
[1:39:18] meeting when we come to camp meeting no
[1:39:22] it's in us now yes no wonder he kept
[1:39:25] selling the people everything you need
[1:39:27] to make the
[1:39:29] Rapture it's in you now we're just
[1:39:32] waiting on the Holy Spirit to come and
[1:39:35] brood over that promise and start
[1:39:37] bringing it out Hallelujah a death has
[1:39:40] to take place to release the
[1:39:42] germ that germ of life that's in the
[1:39:45] seed it has to die so that the life can
[1:39:48] be Rel the old hole the old Shell
[1:39:51] anybody ever recognize you had an Old
[1:39:53] Shell an old hole about you that had to
[1:39:58] crack woo come on somebody said well
[1:40:01] that's just a crack poot that's okay as
[1:40:04] long as it was the shell that cracked so
[1:40:07] that the life can come forth oh yes he
[1:40:10] said everything God promised to put in
[1:40:12] the church in it right now it's in it
[1:40:14] now everything is in order you see
[1:40:17] that's in spirit realm in spirit realm
[1:40:21] everything is in order
[1:40:23] right now we just have to come into
[1:40:27] alignment in the natural realm with what
[1:40:30] Spirit realm already knows you do
[1:40:34] understand you're a dual
[1:40:36] being you're really a Triune being
[1:40:38] aren't you but we say duel because
[1:40:41] there's an inner man and an outer man
[1:40:42] that's two the inner man is made up of
[1:40:45] Soul and Spirit the outer man is made up
[1:40:48] of Flesh body come on and you're really
[1:40:52] of Heaven you're of Eternity and you're
[1:40:55] of Earth just like Adam was Adam was
[1:40:59] made from the dust of the earth he was
[1:41:02] earthy or Earthly we might say but that
[1:41:06] that was placed within him was not of
[1:41:09] planet Earth it was not of the creation
[1:41:12] at all it was
[1:41:14] breath it was breath it was Spirit
[1:41:18] breath hello it was Spirit life and God
[1:41:23] breathed into Adam Adam man and he
[1:41:29] became a living Soul his inner man began
[1:41:34] to form that which would connect him
[1:41:37] between th those two Realms so remember
[1:41:40] that in the realm of the spirit I hope
[1:41:43] that doesn't sound too Hocus Pocus it's
[1:41:45] New Testament theology by the way but
[1:41:48] what what's what we need to remember is
[1:41:51] we're running in parallel dimensions are
[1:41:53] parallel Realms right now the natural
[1:41:56] running parallel with the spiritual and
[1:41:59] that's how we see often times the
[1:42:01] natural
[1:42:03] types the spiritual well let me tell you
[1:42:06] something it works the other way too the
[1:42:10] spiritual can often be a type of the
[1:42:13] natural it works both ways there's
[1:42:17] things going on in your life in the
[1:42:19] natural because God wants to do
[1:42:22] something for you
[1:42:25] in the
[1:42:27] spirit what's happening over here
[1:42:29] doesn't look very
[1:42:32] spiritual it's not very spiritual to be
[1:42:34] sick it's not very spiritual to have bad
[1:42:38] uh situations on your job it's not very
[1:42:42] spiritual but but let me tell you
[1:42:44] something what's going on in this
[1:42:46] natural realm can often be an
[1:42:50] indicator and and here's what God does
[1:42:52] what Satan meant to take you
[1:42:57] out God
[1:42:59] allowed because it's going to take you
[1:43:01] over and we're born to
[1:43:04] overcome come on I don't know if you
[1:43:08] caught this or not but last Sunday we
[1:43:11] said something about overcoming getting
[1:43:13] over the mountain and there was a a
[1:43:16] statement that came that I really liked
[1:43:19] it wasn't premeditated and that is there
[1:43:22] are certain mountains you can't speak to
[1:43:25] on this side you got to get over them to
[1:43:30] be able to turn then and speak to them
[1:43:34] with authority brother brandom said it's
[1:43:36] not more power the church
[1:43:39] needs it's more Authority and it's not
[1:43:42] more Authority I want to take that one
[1:43:44] step further it's not more Authority
[1:43:46] that the church
[1:43:49] needs it's to recognize
[1:43:53] that all the authority that we
[1:43:55] need it's in
[1:43:58] it now yes sir you see so we're not
[1:44:01] waiting on more authority to drop down
[1:44:04] we're waiting to recognize whose
[1:44:07] authority is within us the authority of
[1:44:10] Jesus Christ the first part of the
[1:44:13] creation of God brother if he's backing
[1:44:16] you up if you've got the word backing
[1:44:19] you up you don't have to be afraid of a
[1:44:22] family of giants that's right you don't
[1:44:24] have to be afraid of somebody trying to
[1:44:26] intimidate you on your job you don't
[1:44:28] have to be afraid of peer pressure at
[1:44:31] school if you know that you know that
[1:44:33] you know you're part of him the Bible
[1:44:36] tells us that those who know their
[1:44:40] God shall be what strong and do what
[1:44:47] exploits
[1:44:48] amazing
[1:44:50] demonstrations of God's character power
[1:44:53] and authority exploits there's a bride
[1:44:57] in the earth
[1:44:58] positioning by the spirit now getting in
[1:45:02] sync with our marching orders that are
[1:45:05] not of Earth they're not earthy they're
[1:45:08] coming from another place they're coming
[1:45:10] from an eternal realm and we're
[1:45:13] discovering that it's important for us
[1:45:15] to get in synchronization alignment with
[1:45:19] what the spirit is saying remember that
[1:45:22] before God speaks prophetically to the
[1:45:24] church ages he says hear what the spirit
[1:45:29] yes sir is saying to the church so the
[1:45:34] hearing choosing to hear is part of the
[1:45:39] alignment so now on that rare occasion
[1:45:42] that I stir somebody up excuse me just a
[1:45:45] moment on that rare occasion you know
[1:45:48] what I'm telling you something I don't
[1:45:50] know why anybody any woman anywhere
[1:45:54] would want to shave her
[1:45:57] eyebrows and paint them on it's going to
[1:46:00] get quiet now I don't know why eyebrows
[1:46:04] are such a
[1:46:07] blessing they catch the
[1:46:10] sweat did you know I finally had to stop
[1:46:13] a minute because this eyebrow was so
[1:46:15] full of sweat it was spilling over but
[1:46:18] just think about somebody that perspires
[1:46:20] like me how it would be if my eyebrows
[1:46:23] weren't there Catchings isn't God good I
[1:46:25] know you're looking at me like you've
[1:46:27] lost it ain't God
[1:46:30] good and yet some women you know ever
[1:46:34] never I'm just holing this preacher and
[1:46:37] I can't help it come on just can't help
[1:46:40] it but anyway thank God for eyebrows
[1:46:42] what' your preacher preach on Sunday
[1:46:44] thank God for
[1:46:46] eyebrows if that's all you get that's
[1:46:49] all you get all right everything is in
[1:46:52] order he said the Holy Spirit has been
[1:46:56] given the seed back to the quote the
[1:46:59] seed has been swed the evening lights
[1:47:03] has been
[1:47:05] shining the sign of Sodom that Jesus
[1:47:09] Promised is here and Malachi 4 a
[1:47:13] predestinated church God kept his word
[1:47:17] he sent a forerunner to to hail to
[1:47:21] announce the first coming of the Lord
[1:47:23] Jesus Christ and he sent a forerunner a
[1:47:26] prophet to hail to announce to declare
[1:47:30] the second coming of Jesus Christ is at
[1:47:33] hand and who would hear a predestinated
[1:47:37] church one who made the right choice one
[1:47:41] who said I'm going to stay with the word
[1:47:43] popular or not I'm going to stay with
[1:47:46] the book all right are you got a little
[1:47:48] more in you good in the message
[1:47:51] perseverant faith fath faith will always
[1:47:55] admit the word right it's right the word
[1:47:58] is right now you know the church today
[1:48:01] they can't say the word is right in many
[1:48:04] situations because they're too busy
[1:48:05] saying that's not what it
[1:48:10] means you know Dr Google you know what
[1:48:13] who I'm talking about Dr Google has made
[1:48:17] a lot of
[1:48:19] Physicians out of
[1:48:21] nobodies out of wnab bees and people
[1:48:25] will tell you what's wrong you don't
[1:48:26] even need the Holy Spirit gift when
[1:48:28] you're praying for people anymore
[1:48:30] because they already know everything
[1:48:32] that's wrong with them because they've
[1:48:33] already dror Googled it come on and so
[1:48:37] modern technology has made everybody a
[1:48:40] doctor and they know how to treat
[1:48:41] themselves and diagnose themel and
[1:48:44] modern technology has made everybody a
[1:48:47] uh an armchair
[1:48:50] Theologian and you know what they'll say
[1:48:53] in Hebrew it says in Greek it says and
[1:48:56] you know what you you you got to do a
[1:48:59] little better than
[1:49:00] that because if you look at the English
[1:49:04] you'll find out that there may be
[1:49:06] multiple words that are translated in
[1:49:09] English one way a and and in Hebrew it
[1:49:13] may be one of three or four different
[1:49:16] words and you say it doesn't matter it
[1:49:18] matters if you're getting to the
[1:49:19] nitty-gritty right and so you know we
[1:49:23] we're I'm not trained I'm not trying to
[1:49:25] say I am but here's what I'll tell you I
[1:49:27] don't need anybody to tell me what the
[1:49:29] word doesn't
[1:49:31] mean you don't need a modern church that
[1:49:33] tell you the Bible don't mean that
[1:49:36] that's not what that scripture means
[1:49:38] what we need is Holy Ghost we need Holy
[1:49:42] Spirit to help guide and direct us
[1:49:45] somebody said well we've got the message
[1:49:47] and that's the absolute and I would just
[1:49:49] say to you which one
[1:49:53] which sermon is the
[1:49:57] absolute because if a if a teaching is
[1:50:00] presented in two different
[1:50:02] ways only one of them can
[1:50:05] be the absolute so what the bride has
[1:50:09] had to discover is we have the Bible as
[1:50:12] our ultimate
[1:50:14] absolute and anything else that God
[1:50:16] gives us prophetically by whoever it is
[1:50:20] it has to line up
[1:50:24] it has to line up with that word so you
[1:50:27] know we're better off than most because
[1:50:29] we've got a book to go to we've got a
[1:50:32] manual to go to and if you're not one of
[1:50:34] those armchair theologians trying to
[1:50:36] talk yourself out of what it means but
[1:50:38] you're allowing the Holy Spirit to take
[1:50:40] the message of the hour Quicken it to
[1:50:43] you and then you go back and see where
[1:50:45] it fits right down in there good and
[1:50:47] tight with the book with the Bible with
[1:50:50] the word of God you can whip any devil
[1:50:52] any time under any
[1:50:54] circumstances because you've got an
[1:50:56] absolute how many of you are thankful
[1:50:58] for it faith will always admit the word
[1:51:00] right whether your pastor says so or not
[1:51:04] whether anybody else says so or not your
[1:51:06] faith says it right Glory your faith
[1:51:09] says it right so when she was called
[1:51:13] even by Jesus Christ the one she come to
[1:51:16] and he rebuked her this is a story in
[1:51:19] the gospels a and look at his disciple
[1:51:22] the men was with him in his campaigns
[1:51:25] said oh beat
[1:51:31] it
[1:51:33] sometimes
[1:51:35] somebody that you want to push
[1:51:40] out is just
[1:51:42] looking for what you got that's right it
[1:51:46] ain't easy sometime putting up with
[1:51:49] folks but sometimes we got let God just
[1:51:53] have his way it's not easy I struggle I
[1:51:57] don't do very well but I tell you I
[1:51:59] don't want to be guilty of telling this
[1:52:01] woman get out of here go beat it get out
[1:52:04] when she's there to touch His Garment
[1:52:06] when she's there to get a hold of him
[1:52:08] for help remember if you know the story
[1:52:11] Jesus had gone up into right across what
[1:52:14] we would Now call the northern border of
[1:52:16] Israel in what we would now classify as
[1:52:20] Lebanon he went right up into to the
[1:52:22] north on a little holiday the Bible said
[1:52:25] so he pulled away to get some rest and
[1:52:27] so the disciples were trying to help him
[1:52:29] and protect him and God blessed them for
[1:52:32] doing that but this woman wasn't there
[1:52:35] to agitate him she had a
[1:52:39] daughter that was grievously vexed with
[1:52:42] the devil and she didn't want to trouble
[1:52:45] the master she just wanted one word from
[1:52:48] him that would set her daughter free
[1:52:51] this can all be done in about 60 seconds
[1:52:55] that's all she wanted but the disciples
[1:52:57] didn't understand and they said oh beat
[1:52:59] it get out of here you're annoying us
[1:53:01] don't bother our
[1:53:03] Master oh my my so so they that didn't
[1:53:09] stop
[1:53:10] her no sir nothing is going to stop her
[1:53:15] cuz she's got faith it's going to happen
[1:53:18] anyhow and remember he even insulted her
[1:53:22] oh my the Lord insulted her and he
[1:53:28] reminded her that this was that this was
[1:53:31] this healing was for for the children
[1:53:34] and and and not for the dogs the
[1:53:38] Gentiles this was for the children oh he
[1:53:42] tried to somehow see where her faith
[1:53:45] really was and she submitted she
[1:53:48] admitted that he was right and I'm
[1:53:51] nothing but a dog remember what she said
[1:53:54] she said truth
[1:53:56] Lord you're mighty right but even the
[1:54:00] little
[1:54:01] dogs and and that word dogs that she
[1:54:04] used there is not a word for a German
[1:54:08] Shepherd or a Great
[1:54:10] Dane or a bulldog or a
[1:54:15] Rottweiler or a
[1:54:17] pitbull that word that's used there is a
[1:54:20] word for a little
[1:54:26] yelping
[1:54:30] agitating something like a
[1:54:32] chihuahua I hope I don't offend
[1:54:35] you I know there's a lot of Taco Bell
[1:54:39] fans
[1:54:40] here and I don't want to offend you on
[1:54:43] the Chihuahua but that's the only one I
[1:54:46] can think there's worse I'm sure there's
[1:54:48] worse oh the dog lovers are are are are
[1:54:51] going to mutiny here in a minute I feel
[1:54:53] him coming I mean I say if you're going
[1:54:55] to have a dog be like sister Kathy have

[1:55:03] pony but but the kind of dog that's
[1:55:05] being talked about here is those little
[1:55:08] dogs that just
[1:55:10] yep yep yep yep yep yep and she said
[1:55:15] truth

[1:55:24] crumbs woo that fall from the rich man's
[1:55:29] table oh Jesus was impressed with her
[1:55:32] now wasn't he he said I've never seen

[1:55:38] Israel here you are a gentile she said

[1:58:32] all day on your phone nothing wrong with
[1:58:36] something to get your mind off of some
[1:58:38] stuff but let me remind you that there's
[1:58:42] nothing that can take the place when the

[2:01:48] the whole thing just submit yourself to
[2:01:50] God there's no secret in it it's not a
[2:01:52] Hocus Pocus the only thing it is submit
[2:01:56] yourself to God I believe that with all
[2:01:58] my heart and he goes
[2:02:02] on I'm not going to read some of
[2:02:04] those I want you to go with me to
[2:02:07] Ephesians for the moment that we have
[2:02:09] left it's uh 1:00 and I know some of you
[2:02:12] visiting and you may not know that we
[2:02:14] don't have a Sunday night service so we
[2:02:16] go to the 2:00 hour usually if you need
[2:02:19] to slip out then you slip out we're
[2:02:22] certainly blessed to have you with us we
[2:02:24] won't take it personal or be offended
[2:02:26] but we're not going to rush for you that
[2:02:28] wouldn't be pleasing to the
[2:02:30] Lord but we do understand that you may
[2:02:34] have left a roast in the crock pot in
[2:02:37] the oven crockpot safer in the oven
[2:02:40] it'll be about that big when we get
[2:02:42] through it'll shrink right up Ephesians
[2:02:45] 6:12 for we
[2:02:47] wrestle
[2:02:49] not for we wrestle not against flesh and
[2:02:52] blood but
[2:02:54] against principalities against Powers
[2:02:58] against the rulers of the darkness of
[2:03:01] this world against spiritual
[2:03:05] wickedness in high places remember we're
[2:03:08] talking about that other world that
[2:03:10] other spiritual realm it's not only a
[2:03:13] realm of light but there's a Realm of
[2:03:15] Darkness over there some people don't
[2:03:17] believe in a literal hell well I want
[2:03:19] you to know there is such a place and
[2:03:21] there's a literal devil it's not just a
[2:03:24] concept he's a created being he had a
[2:03:30] beginning and he has an
[2:03:33] ending that's right and you you're an
[2:03:37] overcomer we're not wrestling against
[2:03:40] people we're wrestling against an unseen
[2:03:44] Army principalities Powers rulers of the
[2:03:47] darkness of this world against spiritual
[2:03:50] wickedness in high place
[2:03:52] so we got to press against it so we're
[2:03:55] pressing against
[2:03:58] something
[2:03:59] principalities we're pressing against
[2:04:02] Powers we're pressing against the rulers
[2:04:06] of the darkness of this world we're
[2:04:08] pressing against spiritual wickedness in
[2:04:10] high places but we're not only called to
[2:04:13] press against something we're called to
[2:04:15] press into something and Philippians
[2:04:17] 4:13 it's a small verse but it sure says
[2:04:21] a lot
[2:04:23] I can
[2:04:28] do I can do all
[2:04:32] things through
[2:04:34] Christ which
[2:04:36] strengtheneth me it's just up a little
[2:04:39] bit in the note I can do all things
[2:04:44] through Christ who strengtheneth me now
[2:04:48] Look at Philippians 4:13 in the
[2:04:50] Amplified he said I have
[2:04:53] strength for all things in
[2:04:58] Christ who
[2:05:00] owers me oo yes I am ready for
[2:05:07] anything and equal to anything through
[2:05:12] him who
[2:05:17] infuses are you hearing this
[2:05:23] I started to say a moment ago in that
[2:05:26] rare occasion when I call to you pay
[2:05:31] attention maybe even by name sometime
[2:05:35] hey hello are you listening to me it's
[2:05:39] not because I like what I what I
[2:05:42] say it's because in that moment I'm
[2:05:46] sensing there's something for
[2:05:49] you I'm just being honest I don't
[2:05:52] usually say like this that you don't
[2:05:54] need to
[2:05:56] miss I had I had a a
[2:05:59] horrible situation take place 30 years
[2:06:03] ago that I've never
[2:06:05] forgot I had a word from the Lord come
[2:06:09] to me for a
[2:06:11] brother who was a guitar
[2:06:14] player and what I have found is that
[2:06:18] sometimes people have a tendency to hide
[2:06:22] behind their
[2:06:24] instrument and if you do that you will
[2:06:28] get kind of locked into to one form of
[2:06:32] worship playing your music and there's
[2:06:35] more that that's just one of the devic
[2:06:38] nine different devic demonstrations of
[2:06:41] Praise in the Bible in the Book of
[2:06:43] Psalms and don't don't stay locked into
[2:06:46] one there's a whole ocean out there of
[2:06:50] other demonstrations of Praise this goes
[2:06:52] way back to the early 90s for those of
[2:06:55] you who might possibly misunderstand who
[2:06:57] I'm referring to this goes way
[2:07:00] back and it was a Sunday night
[2:07:03] service and the spirit of the Lord was
[2:07:06] moving in such a way and a prophetic
[2:07:09] word began to nabba Bubble it began to
[2:07:13] Bubble Up I could feel it coming and I
[2:07:16] turned to deliver it and when I did that
[2:07:20] deer br brother was as physically
[2:07:24] present as he could possibly be but
[2:07:28] every part of who he was other than his
[2:07:30] physical body was way off somewhere else
[2:07:35] doing something
[2:07:39] else than where he should have been and
[2:07:42] the Lord you don't have to believe I'm
[2:07:44] going to answer for what I say you're
[2:07:47] going to answer for what you say the
[2:07:49] Lord said don't release
[2:07:53] it some of you were
[2:07:56] there don't release it he's not in a
[2:08:00] frame of mind to do anything about
[2:08:04] it you wait until the right moment I'm
[2:08:09] still
[2:08:12] waiting I'm still waiting for the right
[2:08:16] moment you see it's important that we
[2:08:19] that we're present sir sir at certain I
[2:08:23] mean not just
[2:08:25] physically but spiritually present
[2:08:28] sometime so that if God wants to speak
[2:08:31] to us in some way based on what we're
[2:08:34] experiencing at the moment and he does
[2:08:36] that we don't want to miss it so if if I
[2:08:41] and listen when if you're doing
[2:08:42] something that's distracting
[2:08:45] others from the presence of the Lord to
[2:08:48] receive what they have need of you're
[2:08:50] out of order
[2:08:52] it doesn't matter what you're talking
[2:08:54] about or what you're doing you're out of
[2:08:56] order and you don't want to be
[2:08:58] distracted because everything is in
[2:09:00] order in that realm and we're just
[2:09:03] struggling over here to try to put order
[2:09:05] together cuz you got all these different
[2:09:07] kinds of people in a room that come with
[2:09:10] all their different problems and
[2:09:11] thoughts and processes and so forth and
[2:09:14] it's not easy but I'm not looking for
[2:09:16] the easy
[2:09:17] Road I never wanted just a church
[2:09:22] I was look the churches there's enough
[2:09:25] churches in this County uh that we could
[2:09:27] never fill them all up when God raised
[2:09:31] this place up and and many many years
[2:09:34] ago he didn't raise it up to be another
[2:09:37] church I know it's a little
[2:09:38] uncomfortable for some he raised it up
[2:09:41] for an entirely different P purpose alog
[2:09:43] together let the church do the
[2:09:45] church God wanted you doing a little
[2:09:48] something more than when I say more I
[2:09:50] mean different of a different kind of
[2:09:52] nature we're here getting ready for what
[2:09:55] God's going to do in his people just
[2:09:58] before Rapture just before blast off
[2:10:01] come
[2:10:02] on and listen and how he says it here in
[2:10:05] the amplifi he said I'm ready for
[2:10:07] anything and equal to anything through
[2:10:09] him who I love it infuses oh Jesus the
[2:10:14] reason why I like that word Infuse is
[2:10:17] because if power is just poured on you
[2:10:20] it can roll off
[2:10:22] off remember the anointing
[2:10:25] oil remember it was poured on top of
[2:10:27] Aaron's head ran down his beard ran all
[2:10:31] the way down to the to the uh to the
[2:10:33] bottom of his garments and then on the
[2:10:37] ground that's not what we're looking for
[2:10:40] a strength that just rolls over us and
[2:10:44] leaves us or that we leave here on the
[2:10:46] floor when we leave we're looking for
[2:10:49] something that infuses us
[2:10:51] anybody listening something that that
[2:10:54] that mingles really that's what infusion
[2:10:57] is it's a
[2:10:59] mingling it it it's transferring
[2:11:02] something into you I want it I want it I
[2:11:05] want that strength the joy of the Lord
[2:11:07] is my strength I'm more than a conqueror
[2:11:10] through Christ Jesus if all of if all of
[2:11:13] my neighbors say we can't take it I
[2:11:15] don't want to be like
[2:11:17] them I want to be infused with such a
[2:11:20] faith of God
[2:11:22] and a testimony of the word woo that
[2:11:26] says we can do it not only can we do it
[2:11:28] we can do it now let's go and that's an
[2:11:31] infusion he said who infuses Inner
[2:11:34] Strength into
[2:11:35] me I am this is a part somebody's going
[2:11:38] to have a little Quirk with then go read
[2:11:40] it in the Greek go just oh I can't read
[2:11:43] Greek then look up every word that's
[2:11:46] really there in the Greek and see if
[2:11:48] this is not a pretty accurate extremely
[2:11:52] accurate uh interpretation of what the
[2:11:55] original language is saying here I am
[2:11:58] selfs
[2:12:00] sufficient oh I know that can't be right
[2:12:03] I know that can't be right you stop
[2:12:06] reading that's new age that's new gospel
[2:12:10] that's water down version oh bless God
[2:12:13] nothing but 1611 for
[2:12:16] me and and and don't give me no pocket
[2:12:18] size King James bless God I will one big
[2:12:21] enough to beat the devil with you know
[2:12:24] how religious we can get
[2:12:26] sometime well let me tell you something
[2:12:28] you can't beat the Devil with the
[2:12:31] book don't matter how big it is it's not
[2:12:35] the printed page that defeats the enemy
[2:12:39] it's the living Christ in a
[2:12:43] body declaring the word that's recorded
[2:12:46] in the book that's how it works but you
[2:12:50] got to finish reading this he said I am
[2:12:53] self-sufficient No period there in
[2:12:57] Christ's which is messia Messiah
[2:13:00] Christos in the Greek it's the anointed
[2:13:02] one I am self-sufficient in the anointed
[2:13:07] ones sufficiency you get
[2:13:10] it do you get it I can do all
[2:13:15] things if you stop there you're off the
[2:13:19] word
[2:13:21] but King James said I can do all things
[2:13:23] through
[2:13:24] Christ who strengthens me the amplifi
[2:13:28] said I am
[2:13:32] self-sufficient now if you got a problem
[2:13:34] with that don't you amen sister flow's
[2:13:37] [Music]
[2:13:39] song the next time she
[2:13:43] sings
[2:13:46] uh I'll get it in a
[2:13:48] minute I am that I
[2:13:52] am
[2:13:54] uh the line that says uh Jesus talking I
[2:14:00] did it all by
[2:14:02] myself I don't need nobody
[2:14:05] else I did it all by
[2:14:08] myself I don't need nobody else there's
[2:14:11] only one who can say that that's the
[2:14:14] anointed one I didn't need nobody's help
[2:14:18] I did what I come to do
[2:14:21] and now I'm
[2:14:23] living in you you're not sufficient
[2:14:27] apart from me you can't do it by
[2:14:31] yourself but when you're in
[2:14:34] me my sufficiency oh oh yeah then you
[2:14:38] take what brother random said all that
[2:14:40] was in the father he emptied into the
[2:14:42] son and all that was in the son he
[2:14:44] emptied into the
[2:14:45] church
[2:14:47] Hallelujah remember it's not a head
[2:14:49] knowledge I been with
[2:14:53] him it's kind of an old uh worldly
[2:15:00] thing it
[2:15:02] means I I've laid down with
[2:15:06] somebody it's going to get very
[2:15:09] quiet you know the oldtimers used to
[2:15:12] talk about their
[2:15:13] days and maybe you didn't get to hear
[2:15:16] them you didn't miss a whole lot
[2:15:18] sometime but they're talking about the
[2:15:20] running around they or alicat days you
[2:15:24] know then somebody will say my wife is
[2:15:27] the only one I've ever been with well
[2:15:30] they don't mean sat in a swing
[2:15:34] with I know I know I know it's too much
[2:15:37] for some folks too much for some folk
[2:15:39] they mean she's the only one I've been
[2:15:41] intimate
[2:15:42] with or they might say that gal there
[2:15:45] she's been with so many she don't know
[2:15:47] how many she's been with that doesn't
[2:15:49] mean she's been in a crowd of
[2:15:51] people it it means she's she's been kind
[2:15:54] of loose in her choices that that been
[2:15:58] with is the same as being in Christ it's
[2:16:01] a not a head knowledge of information
[2:16:04] it's a knowledge that comes by being
[2:16:07] with him somebody said that's just too I
[2:16:10] can't even get my mind there well let me
[2:16:12] tell you something I didn't write the
[2:16:13] analogies of the book The the inspirer
[2:16:17] was the Holy Spirit and he's the one
[2:16:20] that inspired The Song of Solomon which
[2:16:22] is not written about a king and his
[2:16:25] girlfriend it's written about Christ our
[2:16:27] Heavenly bridegroom and his Earthly
[2:16:30] bride and it means you've got to go in
[2:16:33] with him and you've got to be intimate
[2:16:35] with him you've got to have fellowship
[2:16:38] with him you've got to love the word
[2:16:40] more than you love
[2:16:43] yourself and you've got to not resent
[2:16:46] the time that you spend behind the veil
[2:16:50] [Music]
[2:16:53] so if somebody claps their hands at you
[2:16:55] and says wake up do
[2:16:57] it just simply do it I'm thankful
[2:17:02] through my life for the year for the
[2:17:04] years of my life when somebody said I'm
[2:17:08] talking to you
[2:17:11] boy it never occurred to me to get
[2:17:16] mad it never occurred to me to get mad
[2:17:19] it only occurred to me hey better do
[2:17:21] better next
[2:17:22] time I'm just being honest now in a me
[2:17:26] message here we're going to go on and
[2:17:27] then close how do you do both I don't
[2:17:32] know in a message in West Palm Beach
[2:17:35] Florida oh somebody said that sounds
[2:17:38] nice no it sounds hotter than here right
[2:17:41] now but in the in the he's telling the
[2:17:43] testimony of God raising the dead
[2:17:46] boy in this message but here's at the
[2:17:49] beginning of the message he he says
[2:17:51] you've got to go do it and you've got to
[2:17:55] fight you've got to press
[2:17:58] against and you've got to press
[2:18:00] in I got to press against the powers and
[2:18:03] principalities and rulers of darkness
[2:18:06] and I've got to press in to my
[2:18:09] sufficiency that's found in Christ he
[2:18:12] said you've got to fight for every inch
[2:18:13] of ground that you have do you believe
[2:18:16] that every man in here that's born again
[2:18:18] of the spirit of God knows it you've had
[2:18:21] to
[2:18:23] fight where you
[2:18:25] been for every inch of ground to the
[2:18:31] mark
[2:18:34] 1975 when I was but a boy and God filled
[2:18:38] me with the Holy
[2:18:40] Ghost it didn't it it wasn't when I
[2:18:43] heard the message that the battle
[2:18:47] began the battle began long before I
[2:18:50] know what I know now
[2:18:53] 75 God filled me with the Holy Ghost and
[2:18:57] the battle
[2:19:00] begins oh yes and every
[2:19:04] victory has come with a
[2:19:07] fight and if you're looking for
[2:19:11] eism if you're looking for Seeker
[2:19:13] friendly Seeker sensitivity excuse me
[2:19:17] Seeker sensitive
[2:19:19] Christianity you're in the wrong
[2:19:21] house what I got a hold of is a little
[2:19:24] bit more than just easy
[2:19:27] pism it's you better fight to keep your
[2:19:30] head above
[2:19:31] water because the devil don't care about
[2:19:34] a half Christian but if you commit to be
[2:19:38] a real
[2:19:39] one he knows your address your phone
[2:19:43] number he knows your strengths and your
[2:19:46] weaknesses he wouldn't have known your
[2:19:48] weaknesses but you tell them all day
[2:19:49] long
[2:19:51] and he's out to get you greater is he
[2:19:54] that's in you than he that's in the
[2:19:55] world just fight fight fight every man
[2:19:58] in here born again the spirit of God
[2:20:00] knows that you've had to fight for every
[2:20:01] inch of ground tow The Mark with Satan

[2:23:25] probably $11,000 well that was a long
[2:23:27] time ago I certainly didn't have $1,000

[2:23:47] I'll beg borrow or oh no I'll just beg
[2:23:50] oror borrow I won't
[2:23:52] steal and and because I believe this is
[2:23:55] the land God showed me and I want it for
[2:23:57] his glory and I've done walked all over
[2:24:00] she said you sure have she said I was
[2:24:03] about to leave you you sure have walked
[2:24:06] all over it she said you've probably

[2:24:11] she said yes I'll take it I'll take it
[2:24:13] and I'll hold it and if I have to I'll
[2:24:17] put one of my own in there she said but

[2:24:25] help you I'm going to stand with you I'm
[2:24:27] going to put my nose out there listen
[2:24:30] sometimes we can't wait until everything
[2:24:34] lines
[2:24:37] up sometimes we got to move against the
[2:24:42] 10 who say you
[2:24:44] can't and find somebody who will hang
[2:24:47] with
[2:24:49] you who as we
[2:24:53] can Footprints is possession now I like
[2:24:57] how he addresses the preachers here
[2:24:59] ministering Brethren he said don't be
[2:25:02] afraid to put
[2:25:06] Footprints to print Footprints where God
[2:25:09] has told you to
[2:25:13] go won't be easy you tell anybody
[2:25:17] comeing here in an easy jump
[2:25:21] it's not easy to get here it's not easy
[2:25:24] when you get
[2:25:26] here cuz sometimes when you're when
[2:25:29] you're visitor you know you're treated
[2:25:32] like a
[2:25:33] visitor and you get F more Fellowship
[2:25:36] you get this you get that the other
[2:25:37] we're not trying to fool nobody we
[2:25:40] usually speak up and say now we don't do
[2:25:42] like this all the time right I love to
[2:25:45] see company come
[2:25:50] anybody with me sometimes I love to see
[2:25:53] them
[2:25:54] go not because they get them I'm tired
[2:25:58] you just get
[2:26:00] tired maybe you don't you're so young
[2:26:03] and spry you spring chicken you but the
[2:26:06] rest of us we get a little weary
[2:26:08] sometime and so making that adjustment
[2:26:11] was not easy for anybody we mention Mimi
[2:26:15] ask her
[2:26:20] ask
[2:26:21] her she gathered up her little
[2:26:25] youngans loaded them up in the
[2:26:28] vehicle and
[2:26:30] came because for her it seemed to be
[2:26:36] life I know this sounds kind of
[2:26:39] clannish or
[2:26:42] death and Zachary
[2:26:44] was still in a baby
[2:26:49] carrier car seat type
[2:26:56] thing now he's got four that needed at
[2:27:00] the same time it seems like but but
[2:27:02] taliana is uh old enough that she can
[2:27:05] help take care of the
[2:27:08] rest she she it wasn't convenient it
[2:27:11] wasn't easy her name was
[2:27:16] mud and my name was mud for not forcing
[2:27:20] in her
[2:27:22] back you just want to you want to get
[2:27:24] real
[2:27:25] real but she made a choice under his
[2:27:30] inspiration that has set a path for
[2:27:35] Generations okay so now she can live and
[2:27:40] die if God Wills where she was supposed
[2:27:43] to be and so can her children that
[2:27:47] choose to and her children's children
[2:27:49] that choose to it
[2:27:52] matters it matters to obey it matters to
[2:27:56] follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[2:27:59] oh I forgot I forgot there were visitors
[2:28:02] here when God tells you something is
[2:28:05] yours your place your tribe your home
[2:28:09] you'll find a way Footprints his
[2:28:12] possession God tells you Minister
[2:28:14] brother don't be afraid he told Joshua
[2:28:17] everywhere The Souls of your feet set I
[2:28:20] wish somebody would go right up there
[2:28:23] around that new house you see the for
[2:28:25] sale sign they built that house on what
[2:28:27] we were told is no man's land come to
[2:28:30] find out they lied to us or were greatly
[2:28:33] mistaken years ago so someone has built
[2:28:36] a beautiful fine home with its kitchen
[2:28:39] window looking right over into our
[2:28:40] Campground I wish some of you don't ask
[2:28:43] the price right now I wish some of you
[2:28:46] would just go up there and put your
[2:28:47] footprints on the yard
[2:28:50] they'll say I'm here to own this place
[2:28:52] praise God somebody said you're losing
[2:28:55] it now let me tell you something God can
[2:28:58] do anything according to his plan and
[2:29:02] will he can and here's what I don't want
[2:29:05] to do I don't want to get to heaven like
[2:29:06] they used to tell and find
[2:29:09] out that there's a pile of of gifts and
[2:29:13] goodies and blessings with my name on it
[2:29:17] that I never let my faith access I don't
[2:29:20] know if it happens that way or not but
[2:29:21] I've had others tell of experiences like
[2:29:24] that and it'll it'll it'll make you want
[2:29:26] to fight for what's yours even when you
[2:29:29] don't know what it
[2:29:30] is amen it's possession he told Josh
[2:29:34] everywhere the souls let's go on I got
[2:29:36] to I got to close now we don't back
[2:29:40] up hello you ought to like that you
[2:29:43] ought to nod a little
[2:29:46] louder you ought to wiggle your toe in
[2:29:48] your shoe a little wider there
[2:29:51] no matter we don't back up it's not a
[2:29:54] picnic for
[2:29:57] us we don't oh no matter what the
[2:30:00] opposition is how great it seems how
[2:30:02] difficult it seems if God said
[2:30:04] so when he gave it to Joshua he never
[2:30:07] said now here's what you're not going to
[2:30:08] like but you already know so you might
[2:30:11] as well like
[2:30:12] it he didn't say to Joshua I'll take all

[2:35:01] that the ement it's a short one I'll
[2:35:04] meet you in the middle God's word is
[2:35:07] eternal we just skipped one I think uh
[2:35:10] charity God's word is eternal if God's
[2:35:13] word is that perfect them who are in
[2:35:16] Christ just as sure to raise as there is
[2:35:19] a Resurrection God is just as obligated
[2:35:22] to his word to heal you as he is to save
[2:35:25] you that's good to know I like that for
[2:35:29] he it's his word that promised it it's
[2:35:31] God's word and we have no right to take
[2:35:33] away from it but just say it's the truth
[2:35:37] believe it no matter what happens
[2:35:39] believe it anyhow that's the way the
[2:35:42] rest of them had to believe it and we're
[2:35:43] not excluded from that God gave
[2:35:46] Palestine to Israel whatever whatever
[2:35:50] but they had to fight for every inch of
[2:35:52] ground they got the promise is yours but
[2:35:54] you have to fight for every inch you
[2:35:56] claim the devil will see to
[2:36:00] that certainly he
[2:36:03] will now here's what you need to know
[2:36:06] God said that land is yours but what he
[2:36:08] what he what he failed to
[2:36:12] say somebody else thinks it belongs to
[2:36:15] them you know I wonder no wonder some of
[2:36:18] them got discouraged and come back with
[2:36:19] the bad
[2:36:20] folk just being honest they said you
[2:36:23] know when God told us to take that land
[2:36:25] he didn't tell us somebody was already
[2:36:27] living in
[2:36:29] it with armies wall
[2:36:35] cities big
[2:36:37] population and that's kind of the way it
[2:36:40] is you need to know God's got a promise
[2:36:43] for you I'm going to go ahead and let
[2:36:45] you in on a secret the devil squatting
[2:36:48] on it yeah it don't belong to him it
[2:36:51] didn't belong to the parasites and the
[2:36:53] jebusites and the hivites and the
[2:36:55] Hittites and the
[2:36:58] amalekites and the aggravating
[2:37:01] nightes it it didn't belong to them they
[2:37:04] just squatted there that's right like
[2:37:07] some of these people will move in on a
[2:37:10] on a vacant home and if they stay there
[2:37:12] long
[2:37:15] enough you got to pay the taxes while
[2:37:18] they live in your house
[2:37:20] that's how messed up this life is
[2:37:22] sometime Come
[2:37:23] On You' think it'd just be easy you just
[2:37:26] go in bulldozer I'm out but that's not
[2:37:29] the way tie a rope around their feet and
[2:37:30] drag them out but they got squatters
[2:37:35] rights if you like that sort of thing
[2:37:37] you ought to move to
[2:37:39] California that's where they like it it
[2:37:42] seems but moving right along that was so
[2:37:44] political wasn't it forgive me forgive
[2:37:46] me
[2:37:50] but the devil's like that he moves in he
[2:37:54] squats and God said you go take that
[2:37:56] land and you walk over there thinking
[2:37:58] it's just an empty land with grapes
[2:38:00] growing on their own nobody has to you
[2:38:03] know kill the weeds
[2:38:05] and you know snakes like
[2:38:09] grapes CA they don't really like grapes
[2:38:11] they like
[2:38:12] birds and birds like to build their nest
[2:38:15] in the grape Vines and I don't I don't I
[2:38:18] don't I couldn't tell you how many times
[2:38:20] I went to my papa's grape vine and met a
[2:38:23] snake there ahead of me cuz he was there
[2:38:25] to get the little
[2:38:27] birds I wasn't going to let him keep me
[2:38:29] from the grapes I don't like snakes but
[2:38:33] I found out you you throw enough fuss
[2:38:35] and make enough noise and they'll go
[2:38:38] on I'm talking about alligators I said
[2:38:41] snakes and they just slither right
[2:38:44] off uh but the devil's not always so
[2:38:47] quick musicians are coming the devil's
[2:38:50] not always so quick to Slither out of
[2:38:52] your
[2:38:52] promise so even though God said it's
[2:38:55] yours you may find out that somebody's
[2:38:57] squatting there you can't let that
[2:38:59] discourage
[2:39:00] you you've got to push the end
[2:39:04] press press

[2:39:26] the prize I'm here I'm here they can
[2:39:30] walk up there without you watching them
[2:39:32] they know the way they don't need a
[2:39:35] map y'all know the
[2:39:38] way everybody was worried about

[2:52:59] [Applause]
[2:53:01] [Music]
[2:53:02] him you see
[2:53:06] folks we're not following a a hawker's
[2:53:11] pitch a salesman's
[2:53:14] line this has been our reality yes yes
[2:53:18] you're right you know we're not here
[2:53:20] telling you what somebody told us God
[2:53:22] could do that's big I love to pass on
[2:53:25] testimonies but there's some folks in
[2:53:28] this room that have experienced this God
[2:53:31] and we've watched him move when there
[2:53:33] was no way to
[2:53:35] move there's people in this room that
[2:53:38] have seen God raise the dead not
[2:53:43] symbolically we've seen God raise the
[2:53:46] dead well I don't believe that well it
[2:53:48] don't matter but I tell you who does
[2:53:49] believe
[2:53:50] it the ones that was raised from the
[2:53:53] dead there's people in this room that
[2:53:56] have seen tumors on the outside of
[2:54:00] people's body fall off and gords
[2:54:04] swallowed and tumors in bellies
[2:54:07] disappear and women have to hold their
[2:54:10] clothes because the dress or the skirt
[2:54:14] was suddenly four or five sizes too big
[2:54:19] when God moved the tumor out of the
[2:54:23] belly we've seen God heal a girl with a
[2:54:27] broke back and she against all orders
[2:54:32] and instructions took off the back brace
[2:54:35] and ran all over the place healed by the
[2:54:39] power of God we saw what God did for
[2:54:42] Casey Hannah when he gave her victory
[2:54:45] over a
[2:54:46] fungus that was eating the plate that
[2:54:49] her brain sat on until little slivers of
[2:54:53] bone were coming out her nose and God
[2:54:55] healed
[2:54:57] her yes and she's alive today giving God
[2:55:00] praise we could go on and on and on so
[2:55:03] this is not what we just read in the
[2:55:04] Bible or what some preacher told us and
[2:55:07] we're too stupid and ignorant and
[2:55:09] unlearned so we just believe everything
[2:55:11] we're told but there are people in this
[2:55:14] room who've been in the
[2:55:16] fire and the fire couldn't burn them
[2:55:19] because God was bringing them
[2:55:21] through and there's people in this room
[2:55:23] that if face cancer diagnosis and on and
[2:55:27] on and on and on and on and go so what
[2:55:30] we're telling you is we've we've seen
[2:55:32] his track record and we know that he is
[2:55:35] what he says he is we don't understand
[2:55:38] why he don't always move the way we want
[2:55:39] him to move but we know he's
[2:55:42] moving and we can testify of it how many
[2:55:46] of you can say I've seen the power of
[2:55:48] God Amen in my own life I know what he
[2:55:51] can do now why don't you serve him why
[2:55:55] won't you give him everything you've got
[2:55:58] don't hold nothing back he deserves all
[2:56:02] of our praise and our dedication and our
[2:56:05] consecration may God pour oil on your
[2:56:08] faith as you leave here today may he
[2:56:10] anoint you I didn't get to that place in
[2:56:13] the notes but we'll get to it eventually
[2:56:17] where God told us you know in order to
[2:56:19] possess you've got to dispossess yes you
[2:56:23] got to drive some squatters off before
[2:56:26] you can take what's rightfully yours and
[2:56:29] the Lord spoke to us some years ago and
[2:56:31] he said I'm going to change the way you
[2:56:34] intercede in prayer and you're not going
[2:56:37] to always intercede from a place of
[2:56:39] warfare you're going to begin to
[2:56:41] intercede from a place of knowing that
[2:56:44] the answer is yours the victory is yours
[2:56:47] God has done what he said so you're just
[2:56:49] announcing to the enemy and declaring
[2:56:53] before your God that the work is done
[2:56:56] amen it's a work of Faith it's an Act of
[2:56:59] Faith and and and we know what one right
[2:57:02] word can do I want to pray for you right
[2:57:05] now before we leave because you have
[2:57:08] needs and God is a big
[2:57:11] God and he can answer you right where
[2:57:13] you stand I appreciate those of you that
[2:57:16] have come forward but God can move at
[2:57:18] the back door he can move wherever he
[2:57:21] can move on the other end of that camera
[2:57:23] God can move so if you've got a need
[2:57:25] before the Lord just put your hand up
[2:57:27] right now and it
[2:57:29] matters I want to tell you it matters
[2:57:32] Rebecca you're young but your need
[2:57:35] matters to the
[2:57:37] Lord just like sister gert's need and
[2:57:40] sister willam's need both of them
[2:57:43] pushing toward 90 and their need matters
[2:57:46] to the Lord but so does the little ones
[2:57:50] and he's able to meet those needs and if
[2:57:53] it's your need it's big don't matter how
[2:57:56] small if it's yours it feels big so I'm
[2:58:00] agreeing with you right now in the
[2:58:02] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:58:06] father I am privileged and blessed to
[2:58:09] stand before such a faith fill people
[2:58:12] and we know that we know that we know

[2:58:23] and today and forever and so we are not
[2:58:26] afraid intimidated or embarrassed to
