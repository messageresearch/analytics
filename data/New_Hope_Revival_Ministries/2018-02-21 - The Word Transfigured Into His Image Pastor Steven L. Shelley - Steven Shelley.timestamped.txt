[0:00] for about six months now I've had a
[0:03] portion of Scripture on my heart I just
[0:06] don't seem to be able to get it off my
[0:08] mind I brought it to the congregation
[0:10] here in Alabama and I even traveled with
[0:13] it but I want to share it with you today
[0:16] it's a scripture where Jesus is speaking
[0:18] about the word about what we hear and
[0:23] what we do with what we hear I know that
[0:28] all of us have heard amazing sermons
[0:31] preached from God's Word many with power
[0:35] and with demonstration but I think it's
[0:38] very very important that we are not just
[0:40] hearers but we are also do and I also
[0:44] believe that there are new levels of
[0:47] revelation and glory that God wants to
[0:50] give us personally as individuals as we
[0:55] engage the word that we hear as we go
[0:59] back and revisit and we pray we ask the
[1:03] Lord father I want you by the Holy
[1:06] Spirit to open these passages of
[1:09] Scripture up to my life and I want to
[1:11] understand with revelation how to apply
[1:15] them how I should react how I should
[1:18] respond to your word I believe the Bible
[1:22] is a written record of God's Word I
[1:25] believe that Jesus Christ is the Living
[1:28] Word of God I believe he lives in us by
[1:33] the power of the Holy Ghost and I
[1:35] believe that it is his desire to unveil
[1:39] his word to you and I personally we know
[1:43] that Scripture is going to line up with
[1:47] Scripture and we know that anything God
[1:50] speaks to us in this day in this hour it
[1:53] must fit the scripture perfectly but
[1:57] when I'm talking about receiving a
[1:59] personal revelation from the word I'm
[2:01] talking about that quickening life that
[2:05] comes from the inside when God unveils
[2:09] our opens up a scripture to us
[2:12] personally
[2:13] shows us how to use it how to apply it
[2:16] in our life the scripture is Mark
[2:19] chapter 4 verses 23 and 24 I want to
[2:24] read it from the amplified version of
[2:25] the Bible it says if any man has ears to
[2:29] hear let him be listening and let him
[2:32] perceive and comprehend and he said to
[2:36] them be careful what you are hearing the
[2:40] measure of thought and study you give to
[2:44] the truth you hear will be the measure
[2:47] of virtue and knowledge that comes back
[2:50] to you and more besides will be given to
[2:54] you who hear I'm thinking about all of
[2:57] the hours in my life that I have spent
[3:00] reading God's Word or hearing God's Word
[3:04] and I'm thinking about all of those
[3:07] missed opportunities that I've had along
[3:10] the way to let that word become real to
[3:13] me personally and individually I guess
[3:17] we've got a lot of making up to do here
[3:19] in the end time but I think there's
[3:21] never been a more important moment in
[3:25] our lives than now I believe it is right
[3:28] now that God wants to make his word a
[3:31] living reality to you and I as
[3:34] individuals this Living Word
[3:38] you see I believe that we need like
[3:40] never before a revelation of who our God
[3:44] is and then we need a revelation of of
[3:48] who we are in God once we receive and
[3:53] understand who God is and who we are in
[3:57] him then we can get a revelation of who
[4:00] he is
[4:02] in us if he's living in us if this is
[4:06] the life of Jesus Christ living in me
[4:10] then it will produce his character his
[4:15] attributes if I am truly bone of his
[4:18] bone flesh of his flesh and spirit of
[4:21] his spirit
[4:23] then through my life Jesus desires to
[4:27] live to finish his endtime plan I'm not
[4:32] just talking about reading the word or
[4:34] hearing the word but I'm talking about
[4:37] reacting to what we hear Jesus said
[4:41] you're the measure of thought and study
[4:45] do you go back and ponder meditate
[4:49] sometimes we use the word ruminate
[4:52] because of the sheep we study we pray we
[5:00] ask the Lord to quicken his word and
[5:03] make it real to us and then we not only
[5:06] have a reaction but we have a response
[5:09] and our response has to be to mix the
[5:13] Word of God with our faith because
[5:16] that's what activates it in your life it
[5:19] may sound a little bit crude but I grew
[5:21] up in a church where they often spoke
[5:24] about digesting the Word of God and I
[5:28] think it's although maybe a little bit
[5:31] crude for you to think about chewing on
[5:33] the Word of God it's not so far away
[5:36] from what Jesus was sharing with his
[5:38] disciples when he told them to eat his
[5:41] body and drink his blood his word and
[5:45] his life when we hear the word of God
[5:48] read the Word of God and we begin to
[5:51] chew on that word we began to ask God to
[5:54] make it alive in our lives I believe
[5:56] that he has promised to give us glory
[6:00] upon glory there's another verse of
[6:03] scripture that comes to my heart in 2nd
[6:05] Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 17 that
[6:08] sort of summarizes what I'm trying to
[6:10] say now the Lord is the spirit and where
[6:15] the Spirit of the Lord is there is
[6:17] Liberty the amplified says emancipation
[6:22] from bondage freedom do you believe that
[6:24] do you believe that where the Spirit of
[6:27] the Lord is there is emancipation
[6:30] from all bondage freedom I do and then
[6:35] it says in verse 18 and all of us as
[6:37] with unveiled face because we continued
[6:43] to behold in the Word of God as in a
[6:47] mirror the glory of the Lord are
[6:50] constantly being transfigured into his
[6:54] very own image I can't tell you how that
[6:59] excites me on the inside of the inside
[7:02] of Who I am because the Apostle is
[7:06] telling us if we continue in the word of
[7:10] God even the very words that Jesus spoke
[7:13] if you continue in my word then are you
[7:16] my disciples indeed and here the Apostle
[7:19] is saying if we continue to behold in
[7:23] the Word of God as in a mirror the glory
[7:27] of the Lord what are you seeing when you
[7:30] look into God's Word I hear people say
[7:33] sometimes it's III read murder and
[7:36] conflict and and woes and judgments and
[7:39] so forth well I want you to know there
[7:42] there's a lot of reality in God's Word
[7:45] there's some truth to some of those
[7:47] things that people say but I want you to
[7:50] know that we have a choice as a part of
[7:52] the overcoming bride of Jesus Christ
[7:55] when we look at the Word of God
[7:57] I choose today to see the glory of God I
[8:01] choose to see today the sovereignty of
[8:04] God and that God is going to take care
[8:08] of his bride in these last days I see
[8:11] the Spirit of God when I look in the
[8:13] word I see the Spirit of God and the
[8:16] glory of God desiring to fall on a
[8:20] people not in visitation but in
[8:23] habitation that we might be a pure
[8:27] reflection of Jesus Christ in the very
[8:31] closing hours of Earth's history I
[8:34] better finish reading this portion
[8:37] it says with unveiled face because we
[8:41] continued to behold in the Word of God
[8:44] as in a mirror the glory of the Lord
[8:47] we're constantly being transfigured into
[8:51] his very own image that's my desire in
[8:55] ever-increasing splendor and from one
[8:59] degree of glory to another for this
[9:03] comes from the Lord who is the spirit
[9:06] let me just mention this increasing
[9:09] splendor and from one degree of glory to
[9:13] another King James says from glory to
[9:16] glory I like that but I like the way
[9:20] it's expressed here from one degree of
[9:23] glory to another maybe you're one of
[9:26] those who believes that we have all that
[9:29] we're going to have and we're just
[9:31] waiting on the Lord to come I want you
[9:34] to know there's a whole lot more going
[9:36] on in this world right now you see
[9:39] because God has chosen a bride before
[9:42] the foundation of the world and by the
[9:45] Living Word of God in us we are being
[9:50] transfigured transformed into his very
[9:54] image I want you to know that I'm not
[9:57] just praying for that transformation in
[9:59] my life but I'm praying for that
[10:02] transformation in the life of the bride
[10:05] of Jesus Christ in every nation of the
[10:09] world keep pressing in keep reading and
[10:12] studying God's Word and make sure that
[10:15] your reaction and your response is the
[10:18] right one and I know that we're going to
[10:20] make it by the grace of God bye bye for
[10:24] now
[10:33] you
