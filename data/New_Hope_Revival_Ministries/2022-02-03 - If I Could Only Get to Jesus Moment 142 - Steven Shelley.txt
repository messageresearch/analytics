========================================

Description:
The Bride of Jesus Christ must come to her maturity in unity.  Then needs will be met.  The display of His Holiness and divine love, of Godliness and brotherly kindness, of respect for the ‘ Jesus’ in each other  will give us the authority to draw on heaven’s bank.  The very “Life of God ’ in us is the authority that allows us to sign the checkbook in the “Name of Jesus,” and our requests for healing, deliverance of our loved ones, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, whatever our need may be, will be met.
