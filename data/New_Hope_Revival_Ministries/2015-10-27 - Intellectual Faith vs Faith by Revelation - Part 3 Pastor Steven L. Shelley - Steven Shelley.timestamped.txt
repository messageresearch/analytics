[0:00] oh
[0:05] [Music]

[0:36] [Music]
[0:38] well hello there I'm Pastor Steph Shelly
[0:41] and I want to welcome you to today's
[0:43] broadcast you're watching the Eagles cry
[0:46] I pray that something will be said today
[0:49] that will inspire your faith and
[0:51] strengthen you in your walk toward the
[0:54] kingdom of God I just want to start off
[0:57] by telling you Jesus loves you he loves
[1:01] you and he is after your heart he wants
[1:04] you to make a full surrender to him and
[1:07] you might as well give up because he's
[1:09] going to find you he's going to keep
[1:11] working on you dealing with you chasing
[1:14] you if you're a seed of God if he saw
[1:18] you before the foundation of the world
[1:21] in his mind saying a big Eternal yes to
[1:24] him he's going to deal with your heart
[1:27] he's going to follow after you hard
[1:31] until you make that full surrender so I
[1:33] trust if you're uh wavering in your
[1:36] faith today that God will touch you and
[1:39] strengthen you and that you'll just
[1:40] surrender just throw up your hands and
[1:43] say I'm Yours Lord take me I'm a mess
[1:46] sometime I need lots of help but you're
[1:49] the great helper I don't know what's
[1:51] going on in your life but I know that
[1:53] whatever it is he knows how we're
[1:56] talking in this series about the
[1:59] difference between intellectual Faith a
[2:01] mental concept of something and having a
[2:06] revelation of Truth a revelation and
[2:09] we're specifically talking about faith
[2:12] faith can be a mental Concept in other
[2:15] words you can hear a truth and believe
[2:17] it mentally it makes sense it becomes
[2:21] logical and so you say okay I believe
[2:24] that and of course to believe something
[2:26] there has to be some Faith attached to
[2:28] it but what kind of faith and is that
[2:32] faith enough to really get the job done
[2:36] that's what the question is and how do
[2:38] we see a transformation how do we see a
[2:43] a a change a metamorphosis in our
[2:46] intellectual Faith mental concept into a
[2:51] real revelation of faith it takes the
[2:53] Holy Ghost it takes the holy spirit of
[2:55] God I want to give you an example in the
[2:58] scripture in James chapter 2
[3:00] verse
[3:01] 19 thou believest that there is one God
[3:06] thou doest well the Devils also believe
[3:12] and tremble now I find that to be a
[3:15] fascinating scripture because it tells
[3:18] us that even demons
[3:21] believe well what is it that they
[3:23] believe they believe that there is one
[3:26] God I want to ask you if if you also
[3:29] believe the the scripture because the
[3:32] Bible tells us here oh Israel the Lord
[3:35] our God is one EAD one if you believe
[3:40] the scripture that he is one God of
[3:42] course he is manifesting himself in in
[3:47] actually many different ways but what we
[3:50] are most familiar with and most
[3:52] connected to is Father Son and Holy
[3:55] Spirit and these are divine demonst
[4:00] ations of God characteristics of God
[4:04] ways that he has demonstrated himself to
[4:08] man and we also know by scripture that
[4:11] in the Lord Jesus Christ dwelt the
[4:14] fullness of the godhead bodily so if you
[4:18] have just say for instance because we're
[4:20] talking about one God if you have an
[4:24] understanding that he is one although
[4:26] there are many different attributes in
[4:28] God and expressions of God and so forth
[4:31] some people like to call it
[4:33] personalities uh I don't particularly
[4:35] like using that word I don't even like
[4:38] using the word persons because I think
[4:40] people can get really really confused in
[4:43] that and have this image of three gods
[4:47] and we know that there are not three
[4:49] Gods there is only one God and even the
[4:52] demons believe that but the point that
[4:54] we want to get to is in what way do they
[4:57] believe that do they have a spirit
[5:01] revealed uh concept a real
[5:05] Revelation that there is one God or do
[5:08] the demons have only a mental concept
[5:11] that causes them to believe that there
[5:13] is one God well I think they know
[5:16] because they've they've dealt with this
[5:17] living God so I think it is a reality to
[5:20] them but I don't think it's a revelation
[5:23] to them because they are what they are
[5:25] they're demon Spirits opposing the truth
[5:28] of God and God's word but he says the
[5:31] demons believe and they tremble now
[5:34] that's more than some people do they
[5:37] don't only believe they tremble at the
[5:39] truth the truth causes them to tremble
[5:43] there are scriptures that talk about men
[5:46] trembling at the word of God and I think
[5:49] that is reverential fear that is very
[5:52] very important especially as we approach
[5:55] the end time that we really understand
[5:58] what a privilege it is is to come before
[6:01] the Living God and worship him in spirit
[6:04] and in truth now when you come by uh the
[6:09] spirit of God draws you and you come to
[6:11] faith in the Lord Jesus Christ you
[6:13] repent of your sins you follow him in
[6:16] Christian baptism according to acts 238
[6:20] uh you're beginning your journey toward
[6:22] an intimate relationship with the Lord
[6:25] Jesus Christ now that that is already
[6:28] the beginning of more than the demon
[6:29] demons have because even though they
[6:31] believe God is one they're not going to
[6:33] repent they're not going to come into an
[6:35] intimate relationship with him because
[6:37] their belief is based on a mental
[6:40] concept I want more than what the demons
[6:42] have I don't want to just believe that
[6:44] there's one God in the same manner the
[6:46] demons believe it I want a pure
[6:49] unadulterated Revelation that there is
[6:52] one God and uh all the other truths that
[6:56] we need to understand in this hour some
[6:58] people say these things are not
[7:00] important but I believe they are I
[7:02] believe it is important to know who God
[7:04] is and who we are when we're in him when
[7:09] we are with him in Intimate relationship
[7:12] who that makes us and what Authority it
[7:15] gives us in the scheme of things we need
[7:18] to understand authority authority is
[7:21] different than power because you can
[7:24] have power without Authority and the
[7:27] power is wasted but if you you have
[7:30] authority and with that Authority you
[7:33] use power then I'm telling you you can
[7:36] get the job done and and even even there
[7:39] in the faith in the church there are a
[7:40] lot of people who understand power but
[7:43] they don't understand Authority and how
[7:45] to operate in that power but God wants
[7:48] to teach us and these things you know we
[7:50] can get the foundation from hearing
[7:52] preachers preach and teach we can we can
[7:56] watch this great television network we
[7:58] can listen to our pastor and get a great
[8:01] Foundation of how the word works but
[8:03] it's not until it is revealed to us by
[8:06] the holy spirit that we really begin
[8:09] look at Acts chapter 16 we just told you
[8:13] that the demons also believe and tremble
[8:16] but look at acts 16: 30 and 31 and
[8:19] brought them out and said s what must I
[8:23] do to be saved that's something you'll
[8:26] never hear a demon say that's something
[8:28] the devil will never say because their
[8:32] belief is in mental concept only they
[8:35] have no Revelation demons have no
[8:37] Revelation to to then do the right thing
[8:40] with what they say they believe believe
[8:43] here's what he said what must I do to be
[8:45] saved and they answered him believe on
[8:48] the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
[8:52] saved and thy house so there is Faith in
[8:58] Believing on the the Lord Jesus Christ
[9:00] that's the beginning of the journey
[9:02] there are many many many other precious
[9:05] truths that God wants to make real to
[9:07] you and he does that by the power of the
[9:10] Holy Spirit we've been studying the life
[9:12] of Peter and you know Peter gets a hard
[9:15] time in churches sometime and uh in
[9:18] other churches he's perhaps exonerated
[9:21] to a place of uh of being the first pope
[9:24] and and the whole church is built on him
[9:26] and so forth so either Peter have a I
[9:28] mean either people have a a blowed up uh
[9:32] understanding of Peter where they almost
[9:34] deify him or they uh almost demonize him
[9:38] you know because he is after all the one
[9:41] who denied the Lord yes he did but
[9:44] remember he didn't deny who the Lord was
[9:47] he knew that by Revelation but he denied
[9:51] that he had anything to do with him is
[9:53] that not terrible yes it's terrible he
[9:56] denied his relationship but many of us
[9:58] have also done the same things and God
[10:01] didn't throw him out oh no God continued
[10:05] to use Peter his best days were actually
[10:09] ahead of him now he wept bitterly I mean
[10:12] he was very very upset I think I shared
[10:16] that with you in the first lesson on
[10:18] this from Luke 22 and 62 it says and
[10:22] Peter went out and wept bitterly when he
[10:24] heard that rooster preaching when he
[10:27] heard that rooster crowing he he went
[10:29] out and wept bitterly but what Peter
[10:32] really needed he had a revelation uh
[10:35] that Jesus was the son of the Living God
[10:37] that's powerful but he needed something
[10:40] else and that was about to happen in the
[10:42] life of Peter I do not believe that
[10:45] Peter would have ever denied his
[10:48] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[10:51] had that happened after the day of
[10:55] Pentecost shavel o I believe on that day
[10:58] Peter became a new being he was plunged
[11:02] into a revelation he now had God living
[11:06] on the inside of the inside of him I
[11:10] wasn't planning to read this to you but
[11:12] let's glance at it quickly together
[11:14] since we have the opportunity to do so
[11:17] let's look at the book of Acts you know
[11:20] a lot of people call this maybe it's
[11:22] even written in your Bible The Acts of
[11:24] the Apostles well I think that's a nice
[11:28] way of of of remembering these Great Men
[11:31] of God but I want you to know that's not
[11:34] what this book of the Bible is about
[11:36] it's not about the acts of men it's
[11:39] about the acts of the Holy Spirit the
[11:42] holy ghost in the lives of men I'm
[11:46] telling you that is what makes the
[11:48] difference men can do great things on
[11:51] their own with their own good character
[11:53] but not to the extent not nearly to the
[11:57] degree that we we can accomplish
[12:01] wonderful and glorious things when we do
[12:03] it in the power and authority of the
[12:06] Holy Spirit Acts chapter 2 it talks
[12:09] about chavot the Feast of the the of the
[12:12] Hebrew Bible and and a very important
[12:15] time of commemorating the giving of the
[12:18] instruction by by God to Moses the
[12:22] giving of the of the Torah the giving of
[12:24] the law and they're gathered here in
[12:26] Acts chapter 2 commemorating one of the
[12:30] three Pilgrim Feast where all Hebrew
[12:33] males are commanded to go up to
[12:35] Jerusalem to worship and here they're
[12:37] all gathered in Jerusalem for chavot
[12:41] this beautiful Festival of the Lord and
[12:45] remember these are not Jewish festivals
[12:47] these are festivals of Jehovah God they
[12:50] are festivals of the Lord and when the
[12:53] day of Pentecost that's Acts 2 verse1
[12:56] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[12:58] come they were all with one Accord in
[13:01] one place that is unity and you know I
[13:05] have many many friends who identify with
[13:08] their Jewish Heritage and they will
[13:10] often make that joke it's almost
[13:12] impossible to get that many Jewish
[13:14] people in a room and all agree well I
[13:17] think it's true about all kinds of races
[13:20] ethnicities and Faith don't you just
[13:22] when you get people together it's hard
[13:25] to always agree on everything even in
[13:27] the New Testament Church chur we
[13:29] struggle with those kinds of things but
[13:31] here they were all with one Accord in
[13:34] one place and suddenly I I want you to
[13:38] know that the suddenlies of God can make
[13:41] a tremendous difference in our lives we
[13:45] wait and we wait and we wait and we
[13:47] worry and we pray and sometimes we doubt
[13:50] and we wait and we pray and we get
[13:52] incouraged and then discouraged we have
[13:55] hope and then hopelessness and then
[13:58] suddenly
[13:59] God comes on the scene and changes
[14:03] everything Hallelujah and he wants to
[14:06] bring suddenly in our lives he's setting
[14:08] them up right now what you're going
[14:11] through right now is God setting you up
[14:14] for a suddenly I have a friend who's
[14:17] been battling that demon of cancer and
[14:20] he said to me the other day I had
[14:22] suddenly it came and suddenly it's going
[14:25] to leave he said I'm I I plan to be the
[14:29] shortest cancer patient in history uh uh
[14:33] it it came on me one day and left me the
[14:35] next day and you know that's that's a
[14:37] suddenly of God and is that possible it
[14:40] is absolutely possible with his stripes
[14:46] they were we were healed it is a promise
[14:51] it is a part of the atoning work of the
[14:55] Lord Jesus Christ that we can also be
[14:58] healed and not only healed but we can
[15:01] begin to move by by faith in Divine
[15:05] Health that's what we're looking for
[15:07] that God would just bring us to a place
[15:10] where we would be in in full order our
[15:13] bodies would be optimal so that we could
[15:15] do everything that we need to do for the
[15:18] work of the Lord in this hour until we
[15:20] get the next body at the end of this
[15:22] thing and suddenly there came a sound
[15:26] from Heaven as of a rushing mighty wind
[15:29] it filled all the house where they were
[15:32] sitting now it doesn't actually say
[15:34] there was a wind it says there was a
[15:36] sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty
[15:39] Wind I think that it is written that way
[15:43] particularly because God wants to reveal
[15:45] to us the power of sound I want you to
[15:48] know that there are important things
[15:51] that happen with sound in our bodies and
[15:56] and there are sounds heavenly sound
[15:59] sounds that I have been privileged to
[16:01] hear at times in Services where men and
[16:05] women were worshiping the Lord using
[16:07] their own voices using their own talents
[16:11] just totally surrendered and there would
[16:14] come a sound into the room that was not
[16:17] of this Earth but was of heaven and when
[16:20] the sound of Heaven invades the Earth
[16:23] things are going to change that's why
[16:26] worship is a very one of the reasons why
[16:29] worshiping the Lord is such an important
[16:32] part of following hard after God because
[16:36] when we worship it opens up the heavens
[16:39] and sound of heaven and power from
[16:42] Heaven light from Heaven is is able then
[16:45] to penetrate into the Earth and so I
[16:48] think it's important that heaven's sound
[16:52] was released this day it filled all the
[16:54] house where they were sitting the sound
[16:57] filled the house and there appeared unto
[17:00] them clothing tongues like as of fire
[17:05] and it sat upon each of them what an
[17:09] identification what a a marking of the
[17:12] holy spirit that that he came like fire
[17:15] like tongues of fire and sat upon each
[17:19] of them who were gathered that day in
[17:21] one Accord verse four and they were all
[17:25] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[17:28] speak speak with other tongues as the
[17:31] spirit gave them utterance there are
[17:33] many denominational churches around who
[17:36] will tell us this was only for the for
[17:39] the book of Acts this was only for the
[17:41] days of the Apostles they needed it I've
[17:44] had men sit down and try to tell me for
[17:47] over an hour how the the early church
[17:50] needed these Miracles they had to have
[17:53] these demonstrations of the Holy Spirit
[17:55] but we no longer need them and we no
[17:57] longer have to have them to today I want
[18:00] you to know I don't believe in that kind
[18:02] of sensation I don't believe that God
[18:05] puts something in his body and then has
[18:08] taken it away from us I don't believe
[18:10] that at all in fact I believe that the
[18:12] hour that we're living in right now is
[18:15] the most wicked and evil hour that the
[18:17] people of God have ever faced in the
[18:19] history of mankind and if we ever needed
[18:22] the power of the Holy Ghost if we ever
[18:25] needed the gifts of the Spirit even as
[18:27] much as they needed it right here in
[18:30] second temple period it's today right
[18:33] now we need the Living God to manifest
[18:37] himself by his spirit in our lives in
[18:40] our churches in our prayer meetings we
[18:43] need the the nine gifts of the Spirit
[18:45] and the other gifts of the Spirit that
[18:47] are mentioned in other places we often
[18:50] focus on the nine but there are many
[18:52] gifts of the holy spirit spoken about in
[18:54] the New Testament we want to have those
[18:57] as a part of our lives we want to be a
[18:59] part of cooperating with those gifts so
[19:02] that God can have his way in us they
[19:05] were all filled with the Holy Ghost and
[19:07] began to speak with other tongues as the
[19:09] spirit gave them utterance and there was
[19:10] dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men
[19:13] out of every nation under heaven now
[19:16] when this was noised abroad the
[19:18] multitude came together and were
[19:20] confounded because that every man heard
[19:23] them speak in his own language look what
[19:26] God was doing he was raising up
[19:28] evangelists
[19:29] who are supernaturally able to speak the
[19:32] language of other nations and this is
[19:36] one of the demonstrations of the holy
[19:38] spirit with speaking in tongues the
[19:40] Bible also tells us that there are
[19:42] tongues of angels and there are unknown
[19:45] languages that are also given by the
[19:47] spirit but I think of course here the
[19:50] biggest glory is when God does something
[19:53] like this he lets people speak
[19:55] supernaturally in languages that they
[19:57] have never learned and the people said
[19:59] to one another behold are not all these
[20:02] galileans how is it that we hear our own
[20:05] dialects our own uh national languages
[20:08] and they were all amazed and were in
[20:10] doubt saying one to another what meth
[20:13] this that was verse 12 in verse uh 13 it
[20:18] says others mocking said these men are
[20:20] full of new wine they're drunk they're
[20:23] just a bunch of sloshes they're drunk
[20:26] but Peter verse 14 who Peter this same
[20:31] Peter Simon the son of Jonah who denied
[20:35] the Lord who went out and wept bitterly
[20:37] the one that Jesus rebuked the one that
[20:40] Jesus looked at and said get thee behind
[20:42] me Satan uh but he's also the same one
[20:45] that Jesus said Peter Satan has desired
[20:48] to sift you his wheat but I have prayed
[20:51] for you I tell you Peter was there Peter
[20:54] wasn't just in the upper room in verse
[20:57] 14 but he was was in the upper room in
[21:00] the first few verses when they were all
[21:02] filled with the Holy Ghost verse four
[21:05] and because of Peter being filled with
[21:09] the Holy Ghost his whole Paradigm his
[21:12] whole mental concept shifted and he is
[21:16] now thinking by the spirit and not by
[21:19] carnal mental conceptions and he stands
[21:23] up verse 14 with the 11 and lifted up
[21:26] his voice and said unto them ye men of
[21:29] Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem
[21:33] be this known unto you and hearken to my
[21:35] words what has happened to Peter he has
[21:39] courage he is no longer just a a a
[21:42] little read shaken around in the wind
[21:46] he's no longer a a denier he is now a
[21:50] proclaimer he is absolutely uh an
[21:54] apostle he got his full commissioning
[21:56] here and with boldness not denying to
[21:59] the little washwoman denying to the
[22:01] little uh uh you know servants that he
[22:04] even knows the Lord now he's saying all
[22:07] men of that dwell in Jerusalem I tell
[22:10] you I like that boldness that he had
[22:12] listen to me he said for these are not
[22:15] drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but
[22:18] the third hour of the day but this is
[22:22] that which was spoken by the prophet
[22:25] Joel and it shall come to pass in the
[22:28] land last days verse 17 saith God I will
[22:33] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and
[22:36] your sons and your daughters shall
[22:38] prophesy and your young men shall see
[22:40] visions and your old men shall dream
[22:43] dreams and on my servants and on my
[22:46] handmaidens I will pour out in those
[22:48] days of my spirit and they shall
[22:51] prophesy and I will show wonders in
[22:54] Heaven above and signs in the earth
[22:56] beneath blood and fire and Vapor of
[22:58] smoke verse 20 the sun shall be turned
[23:01] into darkness and the moon into blood
[23:03] before the great and notable day of the
[23:05] Lord come and it shall come to pass that
[23:09] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[23:12] Lord shall be saved he's giving what
[23:15] we've come to call an altar call he's
[23:17] giving an invitation now you need to
[23:20] accept this Lord Jesus Christ ye men of
[23:24] Israel hear these words Jesus of
[23:27] Nazareth a man approved of God among you
[23:29] by Miracles and wonders and signs which
[23:33] God did by him in the midst of you as ye
[23:35] yourselves also know and he goes on to
[23:38] tell them what they did you delivered
[23:43] him to the determinate counsel and you
[23:46] uh him being delivered by the
[23:48] determinant counsel and forn knowledge
[23:49] of God ye have taken and by Wicked hands
[23:53] have crucified and slain whom God hath
[23:56] raised up having loose the pain of death
[23:59] because it was not possible that he
[24:01] should be Holden of it for David
[24:03] speaketh concerning him now he's going
[24:05] into the deep Prophecies of the
[24:07] scripture which they're very familiar
[24:09] with uh he said for David speaketh
[24:12] concerning him in verse 25 I foresaw the
[24:16] lord always before my face for he is on
[24:18] my right hand that I should not be moved
[24:21] and he goes on and he names many
[24:24] Messianic prophecies Promises of his
[24:27] coming
[24:28] all the way it goes down verse after
[24:31] verse after verse to 37 you read it when
[24:34] you get a chance read it all it's great
[24:37] now when they heard this they were
[24:39] pricked in their heart and said unto
[24:42] Peter and to the rest of the Apostles
[24:44] men and Brethren what shall we do this
[24:47] is the question we need to be asking
[24:49] when God shows up and breathes
[24:52] Revelation on his word what shall we do
[24:55] shall we continue in our traditions of
[24:57] men shall we continue in dogmas and
[25:00] Creeds and dead religion or will we make
[25:03] a new change a new start and Peter had
[25:06] an answer oh yes he did bold repent and
[25:11] be baptized every one of you in the name
[25:14] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[25:17] sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[25:20] the Holy Ghost and I like this for the
[25:23] promise is unto you and to your children
[25:26] and to all that are AAR off even as many
[25:29] as the Lord Our God should call what are
[25:30] you folk going to do with that verse
[25:33] when you come around and tell us that
[25:35] this Holy Ghost was only for the early
[25:38] Apostles what are you going to do with
[25:40] this for the promise is unto you and to
[25:42] your children and to all that's me all
[25:46] that are a far off that's you and this
[25:49] promise of the Holy Ghost is ours even
[25:52] as many as the Lord Our God shall call
[25:55] did God call you did you hear God
[25:57] calling you in the spirit to come to him
[26:00] in faith to repent to believe the truth
[26:03] of the scripture then you're one of
[26:05] these position to receive this promise
[26:07] if you haven't already and with many
[26:10] other words my he didn't stop there he
[26:13] kept on preaching and with many other
[26:15] words did he testify and
[26:18] exhort saying save save yourselves from
[26:22] this unto generation then they that
[26:25] gladly received the word were baptized
[26:28] and the same day there were added unto
[26:30] them about 3,000 souls and it goes on to
[26:33] tell us how God began to establish them
[26:36] and and and and they continued
[26:38] steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and
[26:40] fellowship and breaking of bread and
[26:43] prayers and it goes on and says and they

[26:48] temple breaking bread from house to
[26:50] house praising God and having favor with
[26:53] all the people and the Lord added to the
[26:55] church daily such as should be saved
