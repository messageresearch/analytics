[0:25] i believe the lord is saying there are
[0:27] anointings to be recovered there are
[0:30] mantles to be recovered there are
[0:33] giftings to be recovered that which
[0:36] satan has stolen that which the enemy
[0:39] has stolen from your life as individuals

[1:02] diminished authority in the spirit and
[1:05] god would like to restore some of that
[1:07] authority in your prayer life and even
[1:10] some of you have found your faith
[1:11] beginning to dwindle as you begin to
[1:14] pray
[1:16] you have felt the enemy lying to you
[1:18] even as you were trying to pray
[1:23] he was trying to cause you to settle
[1:26] for something less than what you were
[1:28] trying to believe god for wouldn't it be
[1:31] wonderful if god would restore faith
[1:35] hallelujah
[1:38] hallelujah

[1:49] somebody else but i want everything that
[1:52] the enemy has stolen from me

[1:58] i want my passion for the word back tell
[2:01] him

[2:39] devil he's defeated and he's exposed i

[2:45] time of recovery that has struck the
[2:48] bride
