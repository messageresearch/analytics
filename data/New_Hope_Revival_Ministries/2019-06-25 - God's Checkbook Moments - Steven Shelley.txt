TRANSCRIPT
========================================
god never said it was going to be easy but what he did say is if you'll do it you can have the father's checkbook [Music] the scripture has said if you abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will and you can have it if you check your pocket you will find that you have been given a checkbook to withdraw from the bank of heaven everything that you have need of but I can't get over that man over there that brother over there he just fixes my soul I can't get over that sister over there she just fixes my soul you get high enough you'll get high enough in Jesus you'll get enough of the Holy Ghost and enough of the joy of the Lord you won't even know they exist you'll be so lost in your praise it won't even matter to you what somebody else is doing somebody said that's so easy to say it hard to do God never said it was going to be easy but what he did say is if you do it you can have the father's checkbook Maxon or since he's a God who can move the mountain what what looks like passable you can't get over it you can't get around it you can't get under it a mountain smack-dab you understand that kind of language smack-dab in the middle of your way and you have struggled against it and pressed against it and prayed about it and it has remained and then all of a sudden it's gone poof has that ever happened to any of you poof it's gone the obstacle is removed and the way has been made and here's what I have found out about covenant with God but about remaining in fellowship with him and abiding in him and letting his word abide in me there's so much about that that I still don't understand but from what I've learned I have learned this that if I will do that and I'll write out a check move the mountain and God looks down and says no it's not my purpose right now to move that mountain in your life here is what I have found out about the Lord he will make a way he'll make a way for me to get over that mountain but I didn't see before has God ever made a way for you to get over something that you couldn't get or Denny came just like that praise His name that's who is and that is the blessing and the benefit and the favor of recognizing what God has given to us a blank check and knowing that all I have to do is to obey to abide in him
