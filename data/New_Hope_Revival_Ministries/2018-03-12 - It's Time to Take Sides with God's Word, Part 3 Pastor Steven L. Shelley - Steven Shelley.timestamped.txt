[0:02] [Music]
[0:09] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:20] [Music]
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right Weist
[0:43] in you the hope a lord
[0:45] [Music]
[1:01] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[1:04] Shelley from New Hope revival ministries
[1:06] in Salem Alabama and I'm coming to you
[1:10] again on behalf of the gospel channel
[1:13] and our dear brothers and sisters there
[1:15] who work tirelessly to keep the network
[1:19] going and growing I'd say for the
[1:22] kingdom of God and we're just so happy
[1:24] to be in partnership with them you know
[1:27] the Lord is doing great things and I
[1:29] know that we hear so often that there
[1:32] has been a season shift or this is a new
[1:36] day or a new hour and we hear it so much
[1:39] around the church I think sometimes that
[1:41] it becomes a cliche and I don't like to
[1:45] wear it out but I have to tell you that
[1:48] that's what I feel I feel in my heart
[1:50] that things are shifting and
[1:53] accelerating that God is doing amazing
[1:58] things in the lives of those who will
[2:01] continue to submit and surrender to his
[2:05] sovereignty he's a good god I'm telling
[2:08] you we serve a wonderful father who
[2:12] loves us so much and he wants to use us
[2:16] he does I feel that and I hope that we
[2:20] can encourage you today you know we're
[2:22] not just filling space we're here on a
[2:25] mission
[2:26] because we believe that the Lord has
[2:28] raised up this opportunity to be able to
[2:31] bless you to encourage you to strengthen
[2:34] you and as I say every time we're
[2:37] together your phone calls your emails
[2:40] your prayer requests they mean something
[2:43] to us we take this seriously again we
[2:47] feel like that the Lord has opened these
[2:49] doors and we need to be faithful
[2:52] stewards of what God has placed in our
[2:55] hands and so when you request prayer
[2:58] when you share your need we want to be
[3:01] faithful to extend with you in faith and
[3:04] take that need before the Lord because
[3:06] well I followed the Lord along
[3:09] I've made lots of mistakes along the way
[3:11] but I followed him and he's a gracious
[3:14] and merciful father that's for sure
[3:17] and one thing I've learned is that he
[3:19] answers prayer the Bible says the
[3:22] effectual fervent prayers of a righteous
[3:25] man availeth much I believe that's a
[3:28] genderless promise I believe a righteous
[3:30] man or a righteous woman and don't
[3:32] forget even though we may submit
[3:35] ourselves to the Lord and we may be
[3:37] obedient to him in all things it's still
[3:41] his righteousness that we access it's
[3:44] not of our own the Bible tells us about
[3:47] our righteousness in fact in the eyes of
[3:50] a holy and pure God the most righteous
[3:53] that we could be would still be filthy
[3:55] rags but we've been invited to share in
[3:59] the righteousness of Jesus Christ what a
[4:02] gift I always say so often I say this
[4:06] until probably my Alabama congregation
[4:10] gets weary in hearing it but it's true
[4:14] God has required quite a bit of those
[4:18] who will follow him as overcomers in the
[4:21] end time but it's also true that
[4:25] everything he asks from us he supplies
[4:29] he gives us for instance he says if you
[4:34] love me obey me keep my Commandments
[4:36] follow my instructions and then what
[4:39] does he do he gives us grace Amazing
[4:44] Grace to obey you know when we struggle
[4:48] when when the will of our flesh or when
[4:51] our own soul seems to try to betray us
[4:55] in the sense that it goes after the easy
[4:57] way there is a grace that comes the more
[5:02] we humble ourselves before the Lord the
[5:05] more of his grace he extends I often say
[5:09] he puts it in our grace account and I
[5:12] believe he's doing that for his people
[5:13] all over the world and I'm praying that
[5:16] wherever you are watching this broadcast
[5:19] today that the Lord will
[5:22] see you that he will see your faith and
[5:25] when we pray and we join together in
[5:27] prayer at the end of the program I pray
[5:29] that the Lord will see you that he will
[5:32] hear your prayer he will recognize our
[5:35] faith and I pray that he will deposit a
[5:38] huge deposit of grace in your grace
[5:42] account so that you can be obedient to
[5:45] whatever it is that the Lord is asking
[5:48] of you in this hour so even though it
[5:51] sounds a bit cliche I want to say that
[5:55] this is a new season and a new hour in
[5:59] the kingdom of God and we must not
[6:02] squander it you know I was watching a
[6:06] conference recently online and an elder
[6:11] you know someone who has ministered
[6:14] 30-plus years was turning the service
[6:17] over to a younger man a young man in his
[6:20] 30s but with certainly not as much
[6:23] experience as the elder and as he's
[6:26] turning it over to him he said you know
[6:28] the crowd is here the building is packed
[6:30] the worship has been great anticipation
[6:33] is high don't blow it and it just really
[6:38] made me chuckle you know don't mess it
[6:40] up and so of course that young man was
[6:44] gonna give it all he had and and in fact
[6:46] it was a powerful word that he delivered
[6:49] indeed but I feel like saying that you
[6:52] know the the scene is being set for an
[6:56] amazing intervention from heaven I
[7:00] believe that God desires to intervene
[7:04] for his people and you know there
[7:09] there's something about this word
[7:11] suddenly it's kind of coming to my mind
[7:13] and God's ideas of suddenly are a little
[7:18] bit different than our ideas and because
[7:21] a suddenly doesn't happen until the time
[7:25] is full until the fullness of time and
[7:29] then he comes to his throne are from his
[7:33] throne
[7:34] suddenly so the waiting the preparation
[7:38] is not suddenly it's it's a process it's
[7:43] a journey in fact it's a day-by-day
[7:45] adventure serving Jesus Christ on planet
[7:50] Earth in this hour it's an adventure and
[7:53] it's it's hills and valleys and
[7:57] mountaintops and tunnels and and all
[8:00] that goes with the journey it certainly
[8:03] is but what a blessing it is to know
[8:06] that we're not on this journey alone you
[8:09] know if we're in a boat thank God he's
[8:11] in the boat with us and he's walking
[8:14] with us and so I believe that we are
[8:18] getting positioned for the Lord to come
[8:22] to us suddenly it's just that waiting
[8:26] it's just that that holding on and
[8:29] pressing in and not giving up that
[8:33] sometimes gets very hard and I sense
[8:36] that many of you watching this program
[8:39] today
[8:39] you you are just weary in waiting and
[8:43] holding on and pressing in and I know
[8:46] that feeling
[8:47] I understand that emotion and I know
[8:50] what it feels like to be where you are
[8:52] right now and and so when I say this
[8:56] don't think I'm trying to be calloused
[8:58] because I know what you feel and I have
[9:02] been there often times and I may be
[9:04] there again before this day is over we
[9:06] don't know you know at one circumstance
[9:09] one phone call can certainly make you
[9:12] weary and not only that it can change
[9:14] your life forever
[9:15] we know that but I just want to I want
[9:18] to say to you what choice do you have
[9:21] you know if you're weary in holding on
[9:24] if you're if you're growing tired of
[9:27] waiting what choice do you have
[9:29] you have to wait you know God's timing
[9:33] is not our timing and his thoughts are
[9:36] not our thoughts and they're much much
[9:38] higher than our thoughts the thoughts of
[9:41] God
[9:41] and so it's not pleasant to wait but
[9:45] where are we gonna go what are we going
[9:47] to do I tell you I've come too far now
[9:50] to turn back there is absolutely nothing
[9:54] in a loose life of sin that appeals to
[9:57] me now because I've seen what sin does
[10:01] I've seen the effect that it has on
[10:04] people's lives how it destroys
[10:07] relationships and it fragments families
[10:11] and it leaves you miserable so even if
[10:15] you're growing weary as a child of God
[10:18] I'd say if I had to compare the two one
[10:21] weary day as a child of God is still ten
[10:25] thousand times better than a day in the
[10:29] clutches in the control of unbelief of
[10:33] sin of the enemy because that's you you
[10:38] think sometimes as believers we feel
[10:40] hopeless well I want you to know out
[10:42] there that's where the real hopelessness
[10:44] is it's only in Christ that we find any
[10:49] hope at all so if you are discouraged if
[10:52] you feel a measure of hopelessness if
[10:55] you're tired of waiting just wait a
[10:59] little longer hold on a little tighter
[11:02] because I truly believe that God has
[11:04] seen you he's heard your prayer he knows
[11:08] where you are
[11:09] and according to the sincerity of your
[11:11] heart and the genuineness of your faith
[11:14] I believe God will meet you right where
[11:17] you are at the point of your need so
[11:21] hold on a little longer there's a song
[11:24] that we sung many years ago hold on my
[11:27] child joy comes in the morning
[11:30] the darkness it seems to endure in fact
[11:34] the song goes on to say weeping indoors
[11:37] for the night the darkest hour is just
[11:40] before the dawn what if I told you that
[11:43] there's a new day in the kingdom of God
[11:45] dawning we have a new opportunity right
[11:49] now to draw closer to him than we ever
[11:52] have before why why preacher why would
[11:55] you say we have a greater opportunity
[11:57] now because there's an invitation
[11:59] there's an invitation in this hour I
[12:02] don't know if it's I don't I might even
[12:05] say unprecedented this drawing and this
[12:09] pooling I see God reaching out to people
[12:13] in in my everyday life in in old
[12:17] relationships old friends acquaintances
[12:20] that I haven't seen some of them in many
[12:23] many years and when I hear from them or
[12:25] reconnect with them I hear some very
[12:28] profound things of how God is drawing
[12:31] them and bringing a soberness to their
[12:34] life that makes them want to focus on
[12:37] the things of God again instead of being
[12:40] carried away by the spirit of this age
[12:43] so I just want to say be not weary you
[12:47] know you say well I can't just make up
[12:50] my mind I'm not going to be weary but
[12:52] you can you absolutely can the Bible
[12:55] says for us not to be weary in
[12:58] well-doing for we will reap in due
[13:01] season here it goes if we faint not so
[13:07] that brings us back to the statement I
[13:08] made a few moments ago what else can you
[13:11] do but hold on what can you do but
[13:14] occupy jesus said occupy till i come
[13:17] well there are a few things we can do we
[13:21] can use this opportunity to lay our head
[13:25] on the shoulder of our Lord and learn of
[13:28] him he tells us learn of me take my yoke
[13:33] upon you and learn of me for I am meek
[13:37] and lowly and my burden is light this is
[13:40] a golden opportunity in this hour when
[13:45] there is seemingly a stirring in the
[13:48] deep waters of the Spirit of God a
[13:51] golden opportunity for you and I to use
[13:55] this this opportunity used this time to
[13:58] really draw close to him to discover
[14:02] what he loves how do we know what he
[14:04] loves we search his word what God
[14:08] loves what God desires what God is
[14:11] looking for is outlined in His Holy Word
[14:14] and the more time we spend devotionally
[14:19] I'm not just talking about reading for
[14:22] for a habit or a discipline or in a
[14:25] religious routine but I'm talking about
[14:29] spending time in prayer full reading of
[14:32] God's Word I believe God wants to reveal
[14:35] himself to you you don't even know me no
[14:39] but I know the hour and I know my God
[14:41] and I know that if you are feeling a
[14:45] drawing to him in this in this moment in
[14:48] your life you've got to jump on it the
[14:51] Bible tells us that we can't just come
[14:53] to the Lord because we get ready to we
[14:55] just make up our mind now I'm I'm old
[14:57] and I'm too you know I'm too slow to get
[15:01] out and enjoy the world so now I'm gonna
[15:03] come to God that's not what the Bible
[15:05] says
[15:05] jesus said no man cometh to the Father
[15:08] but by me in another place unless my
[15:12] spirit draw him and so I just sense
[15:15] right now that the Spirit of God is
[15:18] drawing someone yield I encourage you
[15:22] yield to that drawing how do I do that
[15:25] just talk to the Lord I know that some
[15:29] of you have received perhaps religious
[15:31] training and you feel like there is some
[15:35] routine that you have to follow through
[15:37] on to approach God certain points that
[15:41] you have to make certain tools that you
[15:44] have to hold in your hand but I want to
[15:46] encourage you that God is nigh to you he
[15:50] knows you he knows your address he wants
[15:55] to hear your heart
[15:56] he wants to hear from you and you can
[16:00] approach God with honor and respect as a
[16:03] father without approaching him in a
[16:06] religious manner I know that the Lord
[16:09] taught us this beautiful example of
[16:12] Prayer our Father who art in heaven
[16:14] hallowed be thy name I understand that
[16:18] there is so much truth in the Lord's
[16:21] Prayer
[16:21] but I also know that some of the most
[16:24] effective prayer times of my entire life
[16:28] and ministry have not sounded like that
[16:30] at all
[16:31] in fact sometimes they start oh god help
[16:35] me
[16:35] Jesus help me and he hears me because he
[16:40] knows my heart he knows that it's not my
[16:43] desire to disrespect him or dishonor him
[16:46] I want to worship Him I want to live my
[16:48] life for him but the point that I'm
[16:50] trying to make is approach God
[16:53] conversationally you know if you're in
[16:56] trouble if you are in need just speak to
[17:00] the Lord what if someone hears me
[17:03] they'll think I'm crazy well they may
[17:04] think that already and so the least you
[17:07] can do is is use that use that
[17:09] opportunity to talk you're not talking
[17:12] to yourself as it might seem you're
[17:15] talking to the only one who can do
[17:17] something about where you are right now
[17:20] I actually want to share a few thoughts
[17:23] with you today and I don't want to do
[17:27] this part 1 part 2 part 3 so much
[17:29] because we've spent a couple of times
[17:32] together here on the gospel channel
[17:35] talking about the theme that the Lord
[17:38] was dealing with our hearts about at the
[17:40] beginning of the year taking sides with
[17:42] the word and I really want to I want to
[17:46] speak about that a little bit more again
[17:48] today but I want to do it in a way that
[17:50] you don't have to have particularly
[17:52] heard or watch the other programs to get
[17:56] something out of this but I want to
[17:59] start with the scripture that we've used
[18:01] before in mark chapter 4 verse 24 in the
[18:06] amplified version of the Bible I think
[18:10] it's actually 23 and 24 if any man has
[18:14] ears to hear let him be listening and
[18:17] let him perceive and comprehend and he
[18:22] said to them this is Jesus be careful
[18:25] what you are hearing the measure of
[18:29] thought and study you give to the truth
[18:32] you hear will
[18:34] the measure of virtue and knowledge that
[18:36] comes back to you and more besides will
[18:40] be given to you who here so we talked
[18:45] about before the importance of knowing
[18:49] being careful being cautious of what we
[18:52] hear and now we're talking also about
[18:55] being careful how we hear and when we
[18:59] say be careful how we hear we're
[19:02] referring to what are we going to do
[19:04] with it what are we gonna do with what
[19:06] we hear if we hear the truth of God's
[19:09] word whether it's on Christian
[19:11] television or in your local church on
[19:14] Sunday or your daily Bible reading in
[19:17] your home or with your family what are
[19:20] we gonna do with the Word of God that we
[19:22] hear are we going to hear it casually
[19:26] and let it slip from us taking with it
[19:29] every every hope of the promise that was
[19:31] offered or should we engage it are we
[19:35] going to engage that word are we going
[19:38] to confess I believe that word and I'm
[19:42] going to surrender my life to that word
[19:46] I'm going to put it in practice
[19:48] remember the grace account remember if
[19:51] you think God is asking too much of you
[19:53] he has already provided the strength the
[19:57] grace the courage that you need to do
[20:00] exactly what he has asked you to do now
[20:04] today I wanted to go to another portion
[20:06] of Scripture with you for just a few
[20:09] minutes and it's in 2nd Corinthians
[20:12] chapter 3 and I was going to read verse
[20:19] 18 2nd Corinthians 3:18 and again this
[20:26] is in the amplified bible i think i want
[20:30] to go to verse 17 2nd corinthians 3:17
[20:34] and 18 now the Lord is the spirit and
[20:38] where the Spirit of the Lord is there is
[20:43] Liberty and the amplified bible
[20:48] emancipation from bondage it's freedom
[20:52] where the Lord is where the Spirit of
[20:56] the Lord is there is freedom there is
[21:01] emancipation from bondage so if there is
[21:04] something in your life that binds you
[21:07] that holds you then we need the Spirit
[21:12] of the Lord to show up we need him to
[21:15] come in the fullness of who he is and
[21:19] set you free in fact make you freedom
[21:24] and then the the next verse verse 18
[21:28] says and all of us this is a broad
[21:32] promise and all of us as with unveiled
[21:37] face I like that because we continued to
[21:45] behold in the Word of God as in a mirror
[21:50] the glory of the Lord do you do you pick
[21:56] up on the consistency that's mentioned
[21:59] here because we continued to behold in
[22:04] the Word of God as a mirror the glory of
[22:08] the Lord so this again is the concept
[22:11] that Jesus talks about in the Gospels
[22:15] abiding in him abiding in his word or he
[22:20] said continuing in my word and the
[22:24] Apostle is speaking to the church in
[22:26] Corinth ear and he says we with unveiled
[22:30] face continued to behold in the Word of
[22:34] God as in a mirror the glory of the Lord
[22:37] and here's the result if we continue to
[22:40] do this looking into the Word of God as
[22:43] a mirror
[22:44] we then behold the glory of the Lord and
[22:47] here is the result
[22:49] we are constantly being transfigured
[22:55] transformed into his very own image in
[23:01] ever increasing splendor I have a hard
[23:06] time reading that without feeling that
[23:10] promise
[23:11] we are constantly being transfigured
[23:16] into his very own image this is the
[23:20] desire of a child of God in this hour to
[23:25] be changed to be transformed to be
[23:29] transfigured into his image why because
[23:32] we've read there's a promise for us to
[23:36] be we have a promise that we can be
[23:41] transformed into his image we have a
[23:44] promise that we can abide in him in
[23:47] oneness in the same manner that he is
[23:52] one with his father I'm telling you you
[23:56] know I've preached the Bible nearly from
[23:58] cover to cover I'm not saying that I
[24:00] know it I'm not saying I understand it
[24:03] all or that I've covered every little
[24:06] portion but I tell you there there are
[24:09] some tremendous truths throughout the
[24:11] entire Bible
[24:11] but in the words of Jesus if you would
[24:15] just you know maybe make up a commitment
[24:19] or or make up your mind to read through
[24:24] the red letters if you've got a red
[24:26] letter edition of the Bible where the
[24:28] words of Jesus are in red and you're
[24:30] just trying to think where am I going to
[24:32] read next
[24:33] I tell you read those red letters
[24:35] because it is tremendous his words of
[24:39] life in fact I read to our church in a
[24:43] prayer meeting this morning where Jesus
[24:45] said my words are our spirit they are
[24:51] spirit and life you read those words of
[24:55] Jesus in in a when I say devotional
[24:59] manner I mean in a spiritual manner in
[25:01] in your approach you know Lord let me
[25:05] learn from these words let these
[25:10] with understanding come Lord I need to
[25:13] understand by revelation what you're
[25:16] saying I believe that's the only way to
[25:19] approach Bible reading I think that we
[25:21] need to approach it in a prayerful
[25:23] manner and ask the Lord to make it real
[25:26] to us to quicken it to our lives and
[25:29] when you just go through those words of
[25:32] Jesus and they become alive to you and
[25:35] you hear those promises he was bold when
[25:39] he said to the religious leaders of his
[25:41] day when you've seen me you've seen the
[25:44] father I don't do anything unless unless
[25:47] I I see my father do it or I hear my
[25:51] father I'm just living in obedience to
[25:54] him but for Jesus said I am one with him
[25:58] I am in him and he is in me these are
[26:02] powerful words but what about when Jesus
[26:05] started to say this is my desire for you
[26:08] my disciples my followers how many of
[26:12] you are listening or watching this
[26:14] program and you know in your heart that
[26:17] Jesus had more than twelve apostles or
[26:19] twelve disciples he has disciples today
[26:23] we're followers we're disciples of the
[26:27] Lord Jesus Christ students of the Living
[26:31] God much more than that I know we're
[26:34] sons of God for as many as are led by
[26:37] the spirit they are the sons of God but
[26:41] we're students under a precious teacher
[26:45] the Holy Spirit of God takes the words
[26:48] of Jesus Christ as recorded in the
[26:51] scripture and makes them again spirit
[26:54] and life in our heart and when we do
[26:58] that
[26:58] and we hear Jesus saying that that his
[27:02] desire is to be one with us to have us
[27:06] in union with him and and his life be in
[27:11] us when we when you start getting a hold
[27:14] of some of those promises I tell you it
[27:16] makes you hungry it makes you want that
[27:21] for your
[27:22] own life and here the apostle sometime
[27:25] later is making this a reality and
[27:28] giving us a practical approach to how to
[27:31] draw near to the Lord in such a way he
[27:34] said I'm gonna just start I keep
[27:35] interrupting myself I'm gonna start from
[27:38] the beginning again and all of us as
[27:41] with unveiled face because we continued
[27:45] to behold in the Word of God as in a
[27:49] mirror the glory of the Lord are
[27:52] constantly that's a process it's
[27:55] actually a continual process constantly
[28:00] being transfigured transformed into his
[28:03] very own image in ever-increasing
[28:05] splendor and from one degree of glory to
[28:11] another for this comes from the Lord who
[28:16] is the spirit I absolutely love the way
[28:22] the amplified bible and some other
[28:25] versions as well render this from one
[28:29] degree of glory to another I believe
[28:33] King James says from glory to glory and
[28:36] that's beautiful it is it's it's
[28:38] beautiful but I like the way the
[28:41] amplified brings this out because to me
[28:43] I can see the ladder I can see that it's
[28:47] a climb from one degree of glory from
[28:50] one rung on the ladder to the next to
[28:54] the next to the next and what's
[28:56] happening it's a process of
[28:59] Transfiguration that's what the verse
[29:02] the amplified version calls it we're
[29:04] being transformed transfigured the word
[29:07] changed metamorphosis from one image to
[29:12] another image how all by the Word of God
[29:17] by continuing to look at God's Word as a
[29:22] mirror and choosing to behold the glory
[29:26] of God you know some people say how the
[29:29] Bible's full of murder and it's full of
[29:32] adultery and it's full of of
[29:35] horror stories and so forth listen the
[29:37] all Scripture is given for inspiration
[29:41] for instruction God was faithful to to
[29:45] use men to preserve not only write the
[29:49] word but preserve the word men gave
[29:52] their lives so that you and I can carry
[29:55] a Bible in our hand died to preserve the
[30:00] integrity of this word and yet in my
[30:04] hand it's only printed words on a page
[30:07] but all these printed words they
[30:11] introduced me to the real word the
[30:15] Living Word the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua
[30:20] our Messiah and I want you to know not
[30:24] not like just sitting with him here
[30:26] beside me as a friend but when we come
[30:30] to the revelation and to the
[30:32] understanding that he's not just sitting
[30:35] with me in spirit and I can't see him
[30:38] but I feel his presence but he's living
[30:41] in me by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[30:47] Jesus the same spirit remember jesus
[30:50] said I will not leave you comfortless I
[30:52] will come to you in another place he
[30:55] said and I will send you another
[30:56] comforter and I'm telling you that's
[30:59] that's who this is that's living inside
[31:03] of us this is how our fallen human
[31:06] spirit becomes regenerated revived
[31:10] renewed transformed it's by his precious
[31:14] Holy Spirit so I encourage you come on
[31:18] up from one degree of glory to another
[31:21] degree how by continuing to look at the
[31:26] Word of God and behold you know that
[31:29] that's not just glancing beholding is is
[31:33] choosing to see something when I read
[31:36] the Bible I choose to see something I
[31:40] choose to see God's love for mankind I
[31:45] choose to
[31:46] see a path that's being outlined for me
[31:50] some people choose to see rules and
[31:53] regulations that constantly promote fear
[31:57] in their lives I'm not telling you that
[32:00] they're not Commandments and
[32:01] instructions there they are they're here
[32:04] they absolutely are here but when I see
[32:08] them and when I read them I choose to
[32:11] behold even in those instructions the
[32:15] Father's love for me you know this is a
[32:17] conscious decision that we have to make
[32:19] because the Bible is clear even the
[32:22] discipline of God is for my good I know
[32:26] there are hyper grace teachers out there
[32:29] that would have you to believe that
[32:31] there is no such thing well I tell you
[32:34] there is because I've been through some
[32:37] of that before you know the Lord loves
[32:40] me and he doesn't want me to fall flat
[32:43] on my face and he does everything he can
[32:46] to help me and strengthen me and protect
[32:48] me and keep me from doing that but if I
[32:51] choose to keep pulling away from the
[32:54] from the prick you see that's how the
[32:57] Holy Spirit of God comes just like a
[32:59] needle prick he comes to convict us
[33:03] maybe you're in a situation and your
[33:06] mind is working faster than the
[33:08] situation and you're thinking I'm just
[33:10] about to give her a piece of my mind I'm
[33:13] gonna really tell her off or whatever
[33:17] expression you would use and and before
[33:19] you ever get that out of your mouth
[33:21] sometimes you feel the Spirit of God in
[33:24] you convicting your heart and pricking
[33:27] your conscience and saying do you you
[33:29] better hold back a little bit that's the
[33:31] love of God for me and even in his
[33:34] instruction when he tells me be separate
[33:37] from from the world and when he tells me
[33:39] to you know to paid my tithe and when he
[33:43] tells me that I should not forsake the
[33:45] assembling of ourselves together we
[33:47] should gather together in the Lord's
[33:49] name and even more as we see the day of
[33:52] the Lord approaching
[33:54] and when he when he gives me instruction
[33:56] as a husband how I should treat my wife
[33:59] how I should serve my family and
[34:02] instruct and raise my children I don't
[34:04] see that any longer as rules and
[34:09] regulations and restrictions that are
[34:11] here to cramp my style or to steal my
[34:15] life I choose to see the love of God in
[34:19] the pages of this word I choose to see
[34:22] his mercy
[34:23] you know I said a moment ago about the
[34:26] Lord's correction and his discipline it
[34:28] comes but he's working on my life to
[34:33] make me a son one that is mature that's
[34:37] what he's doing in your life he wants to
[34:40] bring you from one level of glory to
[34:41] another he wants to bring you to a place
[34:44] of maturity we're no longer toddlers
[34:47] many of us have been following the ways
[34:49] of God for a long time and we should we
[34:52] should understand that it's time to grow
[34:54] up in every area of our life and again
[34:57] there's grace to do it God's giving the
[35:00] invitation he's providing the Grace and
[35:04] yes even the correction at times the
[35:07] Bible says that if we are not chastened
[35:11] of the Lord if we are not corrected of
[35:13] the Lord we don't belong to the Lord
[35:15] we're none of his we're illegitimate and
[35:18] I want you to know none of us would want
[35:21] to face God like that we are his he is
[35:26] our Good Shepherd our great Shepherd and
[35:29] he wants to teach us and instruct us I
[35:33] tell you I believe in my heart that if
[35:35] if it didn't have to be you know if the
[35:38] Lord could just love me into total
[35:41] submission he would rather do it that
[35:43] way don't tell my wife I said this but
[35:47] I've got a pretty hard head sometime and
[35:50] he loves me he I know I feel and since
[35:54] his love but but sometimes he he has to
[35:57] do a little bit more than just love me
[36:00] to get me to stop and say wait a minute
[36:02] what spirit are you under well what are
[36:04] you trying to do you know
[36:05] it's not what God would desire for you
[36:08] to do that's love folks that's love I'm
[36:12] so thankful I'm so grateful that I'm a
[36:16] part of a covenant like that and a
[36:19] relationship like that it's it's so much
[36:22] more than a contract it's a love affair
[36:25] and he wants to bring me closer and
[36:29] closer to his image and really I want
[36:34] that with all my heart and I've
[36:36] discovered that the struggle is
[36:39] sometimes not in the doing but in the
[36:43] being still sometimes we just have to be
[36:46] still before the Lord and let him work
[36:49] on us let his spirit see that's where
[36:53] that spirit of the Lord is so important
[36:55] now the Lord is the spirit and where the
[36:57] Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[37:00] emancipation from bondage and sometimes
[37:04] we so desperately need that emancipation
[37:09] that deliverance that freedom in our
[37:11] lives you know what I'm not ashamed to
[37:14] admit it I'd rather be transparent
[37:17] because I know there are so many people
[37:19] in this whole world who you know love
[37:24] the Lord who know the Lord they've had a
[37:26] measure of relationship with the Lord
[37:28] and they just are stuck they just feel
[37:32] like they're not getting any any closer
[37:34] to him just try yielding just try saying
[37:37] Lord I'm willing to cooperate with your
[37:40] plan for my life because I believe it's
[37:43] very important for us to come into
[37:44] agreement and telling you know telling
[37:48] Lord I agree with your plans and
[37:51] purposes for my life because I'm yours
[37:54] you know your life my life is not my own
[37:58] it's not your own we are bought with the
[38:00] price an incorruptible price the
[38:03] precious blood of the sacrificial lamb
[38:08] indeed the Lamb that was slain before
[38:11] the foundation of the world and that
[38:14] blood covers me because I've asked him
[38:18] to cover me in
[38:19] that blood and that blood not only
[38:21] covers my sin but it brings
[38:24] justification it brings complete
[38:27] reconciliation the King James word is
[38:30] propitiation it means that my sins are
[38:34] not just covered and one day they may be
[38:38] exposed again because the blood may wear
[38:41] off no no my sins your sins if we ask
[38:46] they are remitted the blood of Jesus
[38:50] absolutely takes them and and erases
[38:54] them from history as though they never
[38:57] existed in the sea of forgetfulness far
[39:02] removed as the East is from the West
[39:04] never to be remembered against you
[39:06] anymore praise God that ought to make
[39:10] anybody want to serve the Lord because
[39:13] he can right the wrong if we come into
[39:16] fellowship into agreement so one of the
[39:19] things that God wants to make real to us
[39:22] in this hour is that we would be able to
[39:24] truly trust and embrace who God is
[39:30] because some of us have a very distorted
[39:32] view of who God is let the word of God
[39:38] the the written record of God's Word let
[39:42] it reveal let it describe and then that
[39:47] let the Spirit of God take the
[39:49] description from the word and reveal it
[39:51] to your heart who God really is you
[39:55] don't go to the magazine to find out who
[39:59] God is you don't you don't turn on the
[40:01] news it's not CNN or BBC that we go to
[40:05] to get the information on who God is we
[40:09] go to this book and even in reading it
[40:12] we can miss it even in reading it we can
[40:15] miss who he is so then we need the
[40:17] Spirit of God to make it real to quicken
[40:22] it to our hearts who God is and then we
[40:25] need a revelation of who we
[40:28] are in God who we are we were chosen the
[40:34] Bible tells us very clearly that to
[40:39] those that God loved to those that he
[40:42] chose he he predestinated them I know
[40:46] that's a scary word in theology but it's
[40:51] it's about foreknowledge it's about God
[40:55] knowing you before the foundation of the
[40:58] world
[40:59] and he didn't just see your stuff he saw
[41:02] your heart before you were ever born he
[41:06] knew your choice whether or not you
[41:10] would choose to serve him ultimately or
[41:13] whether you would ultimately reject him
[41:15] on one of our programs we said I I was
[41:19] reviewing it recently and at the end of
[41:21] the program we we talked about the fact
[41:24] that as as much as it pains us to say
[41:27] some people will not overcome but the
[41:31] promise is there and it's available if
[41:35] you feel that quickening when you read
[41:40] those promises of how God calls the
[41:43] overcomers to come higher and maybe you
[41:47] begin to feel the pulling in that that
[41:49] you've never felt before yield to that
[41:52] yield your heart to that and tell the
[41:56] Lord you know if you begin to feel the
[41:58] Spirit of God moving I don't want you to
[42:00] think that this is all about feelings
[42:03] it's about faith in fact whether we feel
[42:07] him or not he's real and whether we feel
[42:10] his presence or not he's with us how do
[42:12] you know his word said so so it's not as
[42:16] much about feelings as it is about faith
[42:19] but I know what it means to feel the
[42:22] presence of the Lord he wants us to
[42:26] experience his presence and if you begin
[42:29] to feel that moving in your life when
[42:32] you're watching Christian television
[42:33] when you're hearing your pastor preach
[42:36] when you're reading the Word of God in
[42:38] your home yield to that
[42:40] until the Lord Lord thank you thank you
[42:43] for letting me feel your presence thank
[42:45] you for letting me have that connection
[42:47] with you so we need to know who God is
[42:51] and who we are in him because of his
[42:55] love for us and then we asked for a
[42:58] revelation of who that makes God in us
[43:01] who is God in me what in the world does
[43:04] that mean it means to understand the
[43:09] dimensions of his love for me and that
[43:15] he wanted to come and live in me this is
[43:18] it's mind-boggling I can understand a
[43:22] God who wants to live in eternity and
[43:24] look down on the world and I can
[43:27] understand a God who chose me and who
[43:30] saw me and who loved me not that I'm
[43:33] worthy but it was it was God's love
[43:36] toward me I didn't deserve it I didn't
[43:38] earn it but when I could when I get to
[43:41] thinking about a God who not just wants
[43:44] to sit above the world and look and
[43:45] watch things over you know maybe twiddle
[43:48] his thumbs while while history marches
[43:50] on but he wants to come and live in me
[43:55] he wants to live in you he wants to
[43:59] occupy your body with His Holy Spirit
[44:03] I'm telling you if the mighty Conqueror
[44:06] is living inside of me I can make it I
[44:10] can get through my problems I can get
[44:13] through those difficult circumstances of
[44:15] life hey I can do anything in fact the
[44:19] Bible reminds us I can do all things
[44:23] don't stop there this isn't just
[44:26] self-help no siree it's understanding
[44:31] who God is in me I can do all things how
[44:35] through Christ through Messiah who
[44:38] dwells who lives inside of me and he
[44:44] lives inside of you so when we hear the
[44:47] word of God it's sometimes it sometimes
[44:50] requires a another level
[44:53] of glory another level of Revelation in
[44:59] other words you know sometimes we read a
[45:02] scripture and we get something out of it
[45:04] and later on in our journey we read
[45:08] those same verses and we get something
[45:10] else out of it you understand another
[45:12] level of Revelation another degree of
[45:15] glory yeah I I don't think it's wrong to
[45:18] ask the Lord father I won't understand
[45:22] more from your word I want more of your
[45:25] word working in me and I want you to
[45:28] show me things that I've never yet seen
[45:30] you say but I've read the Bible
[45:33] cover-to-cover I understand many people
[45:36] have but we all can use another
[45:40] dimension another level of understanding
[45:42] from God's Word and wait a minute before
[45:45] before you misunderstand I'm not talking
[45:48] about intellectual understanding all
[45:50] that can get you in an argument you know
[45:54] on the park bench somewhere with a bunch
[45:55] of bunch of religious thinkers I'm not
[45:59] talking about that I'm not talking about
[46:01] a deeper intellectual understanding I'm
[46:04] sorry no I'm talking about another level
[46:08] of heart understanding God making
[46:13] himself and his word real to my heart to
[46:18] my life to make it relevant because I'm
[46:21] telling you the Word of God is relevant
[46:25] for today let me give you another verse
[46:28] it that's in my heart it's kind of
[46:30] bubbling would you turn if you maybe
[46:33] you're in your living room you can grab
[46:35] your Bible off the coffee table and if
[46:38] not then you can follow along with me
[46:40] but in John chapter 6 and verse 55 this
[46:46] gets this gets pretty deep in here these
[46:49] verses of Scripture I'm reading it from
[46:52] the amplified again
[46:53] John John 655 chapter 6 verse 55 for my
[47:01] flesh is true and genuine food
[47:06] and my blood is true and genuine drink
[47:11] uh-oh what does that mean what is Jesus
[47:17] saying let's read on Hugh feeds on my
[47:21] flesh and drinks my blood dwelleth
[47:25] continually in me remember what we were
[47:30] talking about just a moment ago
[47:32] hallelujah
[47:33] continuing to look at the Word of God as
[47:36] in a mirror beholding the glory of the
[47:39] Lord
[47:40] here is Jesus explaining he who feeds on
[47:43] my flesh and drinks my blood dwelleth
[47:47] continually in me and I in like manner
[47:51] dwell continually in him he's speaking
[47:56] about the word and the spirit the body
[48:00] word of Jesus Christ and that
[48:03] life-giving spirit the Bible tells us in
[48:07] the Old Testament that the life is in
[48:11] the blood and so when we're reading here
[48:13] about the blood of Jesus we're reading
[48:16] about the life that comes by the
[48:19] quickening of the Spirit when we feast
[48:23] on the word the Living Word the body
[48:27] word of Jesus Christ but how do we
[48:29] approach that by by this written record
[48:33] of God's Word then verse 57 just as the
[48:37] living father sent me and I live by
[48:41] through because of the Father even so
[48:45] whoever continues to feed on me who
[48:50] takes me for his food and is nourished
[48:54] by me shall in his turn live through and
[49:01] because of me Jesus wants to provide
[49:07] nourishment for your life in the same
[49:12] manner that healthy good whole food
[49:17] provides nourish
[49:19] for our physical body the Word of God is
[49:25] available to us for our spiritual
[49:28] nourishment for our strength in Jesus
[49:32] says whoever whosoever continues to feed
[49:39] on me who takes me for his food and is
[49:44] nourished by me verse 58 this is the
[49:47] bread which came down from heaven it is
[49:51] not like the manna which our forefathers
[49:53] ate and yet died he who takes this bread
[49:58] for his food shall live forever what a
[50:04] benefit he said these things in a
[50:07] synagogue while he was teaching at
[50:10] Capernaum but here is something very
[50:17] important to consider this perhaps is
[50:20] one of the most mysterious and spiritual
[50:24] and supernatural sermons that Jesus has
[50:30] ever had with his disciples I'm telling
[50:33] you this this is another level he's
[50:37] often teaching in parables because he's
[50:40] speaking to many different groups of
[50:42] people and when the disciples asked him
[50:46] about why he used parables he explained
[50:49] because to you it has been given to know
[50:54] the mysteries of the kingdom but to them
[50:57] it has not been given and so he was
[51:00] using parables natural symbols that had
[51:05] a deeper spiritual meaning for those
[51:09] that God desired to reveal deeper truth
[51:14] to the others got a good spiritual
[51:17] lesson they got something out of the
[51:20] parables but they didn't necessarily get
[51:23] the the full impact of what Jesus was
[51:28] saying but he knew that there were those
[51:31] who not only
[51:32] the meaning of the symbols but they got
[51:35] the root they got the real depth of what
[51:38] was being shared in the parable but here
[51:43] the Lord is giving a sermon of sermons
[51:46] it seems mysterious it seems strange
[51:51] please remember that he was speaking to
[51:54] two people many of which knew the law of
[51:59] Moses they knew that it was prohibited
[52:03] to to drink blood
[52:05] because life is in the blood it was
[52:08] certainly unclean to eat human flesh
[52:14] Jesus wasn't suggesting that anyone
[52:17] become a cannibal he was speaking to
[52:20] them on a much deeper more spiritual
[52:23] dimension level degree of glory and
[52:27] here's how it went
[52:29] verse 60 when his disciples heard this
[52:34] many of them said this is a hard and
[52:40] difficult and strange saying I don't
[52:46] know if there are any preachers out
[52:47] there but if you're watching how would
[52:49] you feel if your congregation came up to
[52:52] you Sunday and said god bless you Pastor
[52:55] but that was a hard difficult and
[52:59] strange saying this was their response
[53:02] but they were being honest and it goes
[53:06] on this is a hard and difficult and
[53:09] strange saying and offensive and
[53:13] unbearable message oh the amplified
[53:17] certainly makes it strong this is
[53:21] offensive and this is unbearable who are
[53:25] you talking to you're not talking to
[53:27] your local preacher down the road
[53:28] although he should be honored and
[53:30] respected they're speaking to the Word
[53:34] made flesh Jesus this is so offensive
[53:37] and so hard to understand
[53:40] we can't even bear such a word and
[53:43] notice it doesn't say when the crowd
[53:45] God heard it this was their response
[53:48] when his disciples his closest followers
[53:53] who can stand to hear it who can be
[53:56] expected to listen to such teaching
[54:00] verse 61 but Jesus knowing in himself
[54:04] that his disciples were complaining and
[54:06] protesting and grumbling about it
[54:08] evidently they hadn't said it to him
[54:10] but he knew it he said to them is this a
[54:15] stumbling block and an offense to you
[54:17] does this upset and displease and shock
[54:20] and scandalize you what then will be
[54:23] your reaction if you should see the Son
[54:25] of Man ascending to the place where he
[54:27] was before
[54:28] it is the spirit verse 63 I want to read
[54:31] it I want you two to hear it it is the
[54:34] spirit that gives life he is the life
[54:37] giver the flesh conveys no benefit
[54:40] whatever there is no profit in it the
[54:43] words truths that I have been speaking
[54:46] to you our spirit and life but still
[54:50] some of you fail to believe and trust
[54:52] and have faith for jesus knew from the
[54:55] first who did not believe and had no
[54:59] faith and who would betray him and be
[55:03] false to him and he said in verse 65
[55:06] this is why I told you that no one can
[55:09] come to me unless it is granted him
[55:11] unless he isn't it unless he is enabled
[55:15] to do so by my father verse 66 after
[55:20] this many of his disciples drew back
[55:22] returned to their old associations and
[55:25] no longer accompanied him I've got just
[55:29] a few minutes left I've got a hurry but
[55:32] I want to read this jesus said to the
[55:35] twelve will you also go away and do you
[55:38] desire to leave me in Simon Peter Oh
[55:41] Peter answered Lord to whom shall we go
[55:46] remember what I said to you in the
[55:49] beginning of the program you're weary
[55:51] you're tired of holding on what choice
[55:54] do you have
[55:55] what is the alternative would you go
[55:57] back to sin
[55:58] would you go back to the things of the
[56:00] world would you forsake Jesus because he
[56:03] wasn't moving in your timeframe or
[56:06] according to your schedule no I don't
[56:09] think so not if you've been truly born
[56:11] again of the Spirit of God I don't think
[56:14] you may be discouraged you may feel like
[56:16] throwing up your hands and quitting but
[56:18] I don't believe you'd be able to forsake
[56:20] him and go back to the world i I believe
[56:23] surely you would have a response at
[56:27] least that's my prayer for you and I
[56:29] hope you pray the same for me I hope you
[56:31] would have a response more like Peter
[56:33] Simon Peter verse 68 answered Lord to
[56:37] whom shall we go you have the words the
[56:43] message of eternal life and we have
[56:47] learned to believe and trust and more we
[56:50] have come to know surely that you are
[56:52] the Christ the Messiah The Anointed One
[56:55] the son of the Living God and he goes on
[56:58] to speak to them about choosing the
[57:00] twelve and revealing Judas understanding
[57:06] what was going on even in their hearts I
[57:09] just love that I love that portion of
[57:12] Scripture where would we go Lord there
[57:14] is no truth but in you where would we
[57:17] get our life where would we get our help
[57:20] our hope our strength our comfort you
[57:23] alone have the words of eternal life
[57:25] this is what it means to stand with the
[57:28] word to take sides with the word not the
[57:31] book the Living Word if you continue to
[57:35] eat allow me he said Jesus to be
[57:39] nourishment oh my this is what we desire
[57:42] father would you make your word real and
[57:46] quicken it to the hearts of everyone
[57:49] watching this program who has that
[57:51] desire you are the Living Word given to
[57:55] us of a father who loved us so much and
[57:59] I pray that you will take us O God to
[58:02] another degree of glory of understanding
[58:06] and revelry
[58:07] in this new season we pray these things
[58:10] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:13] Yeshua our Messiah thank you so much for
[58:16] studying with us today I've enjoyed
[58:19] being here and I feel like some of you
[58:22] have been pulling on the Spirit of God
