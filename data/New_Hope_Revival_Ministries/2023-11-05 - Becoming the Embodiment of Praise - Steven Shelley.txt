Great Is Our [Music] God put your hands together and tell him how great he is you find your way back to your seats hallelujah hallelujah do you have a need on your heart today as we we go to prayer all over the building we want to remember our sister Flo she is not feeling well today congestion and losing her voice we want to ask the Lord to touch her would you remember Sister Terry Lawler to the Lord that God will touch her sister Gert was sick is doing some better and now Sister Terry is sick let's ask the Lord to touch them they didn't want to spread it they just and and so I appreciate that but we want the Lord to raise them up uh I had a note today from my friend Jeff rug Sager's wife Amanda she sent me a note this morning and said that they had taken the ventilator off and so far he's breathing on his own thank you Lord this is really a miracle and would you keep praying for him that God will continue to help him I want us to pray for Smith Station our community and I want us to pray for uh the family of our late mayor there is a shadow that will hang over this community for some time over this awful tragedy that has taken place a great uh Scandal ending in a tragedy and there are people on all sides of this issue who are hurting some are angry some are bitter and uh my heart goes out to his wife and children today that God would reach out to them and comfort them plus he was a pastor of the First Baptist Church in Phoenix City so there's a whole Congregation of people who are hurting for many reasons this morning it's the least that we can do as being a part of this community is to pray for all of them that God will have mercy if if something like this can get through our prayers and our righteous testimony in this community if something like this if something this dark can break through then I have to believe that it is absolutely the enemy who's working against what God has ordained for this County yes I have to believe that it's the enemy working over time to steal the prophetic Destiny of this place and we're going to contend against that spirit and believe that uh righteousness and Purity and Holiness will prevail but I will I will tell you this there is no true Holiness or true righteousness outside the revealed word I mean that is the truth you you can't you can't fake it till you make no it it takes the revelation of the word of God to deliver you from those kinds of things and that's not going to happen in denominations that's only going to happen where the pure word is is is lived is preached is sung is testified and is lived so let's pray that God will use this as a great opportunity to shift this whole area oh I'm believing for it yes amen would you stand once again as we prepare to go to prayer he's my Lord there is no other one he's my [Music] Lord there is no other one who can Cal the storms of life like my Lord L he give rest to the weary give New [Music] Life there no [Music] doubt about it is brother Hawk will you come and pray for us today please please he's my Lord he's my [Music] Lord there is no other [Music] one who can come storms of life like my Lord he'll give rest to the weary give rest give new life to the Hopeless there no [Music] doubt Jesus oh thank you Jesus thank you Jesus father I just want to thank you for the access that we have to come before you Lord that's right we've been singing about the price you paid yes sir you came into this Earth Hallelujah to redeem those that you knew before you even created this Earth You humbled yourself and you live lived a life that expressed your nature your love your power and who you truly are [Music] amen and that song that we were singing it just in my mind I was just thinking about that is the revelation of Jesus Christ everything that you are and that is behind the name of Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ father I just wna lift up Sister Flo sister Terry brother Jeff I want to thank you for what you're doing for brother Jeff and I'm asking Lord that you would Minister a supernatural power in their life you would touch their physical body in the name of Jesus Jesus you would make them whole according to the revealed word Lord I I just want to pray for like brother Shel was asking for to pray for this community would you just move among us would you pour out your spirit would you convict people would you reveal Ral yourself to people father we call on you Lord we call on you to pour out your spirit Among Us in this house in our community Lord there's nothing that can happen without you nothing makes any sense without you you are the Creator you are the purpose and so I ask you to just to I've been praying Lord expose light uh the darkness with your light you are light and I'm asking you to expose the darkness in us and in in this area in our community expose it it's the only way for freedom I Just Want to Thank You Lord I want to come before you right now and thank you for everything you've done I

amen God is good we have some birthdays this week sister Helga who is a streamer and uh a visitor and she didn't get to be in camp meeting this year but she is a sister I told you that got a cabin and she watched every service and without any distraction so we send her uh a happy birthday greeting today she is from Iceland but is living in Denmark I saw today where it's I don't see where's sister Rebecca is she not here today I saw where it's Mason's birthday so let's uh let's uh pass a greeting along to Mason and uh on Monday we we think about every year this is the kind of the season of the anniversaries of the manifestation of the spoken word and so tomorrow is the anniversary where he said little fishy I give you your life and it and God did exactly that and it speaks to us of the Resurrection voice the voice of the Resurrection that's in the bride of Christ and she's going to call with her bridegroom she's going to call for the resurrection and it's sooner than what we have believed it's coming it certainly is coming then on Tuesday of this week is a friend of mine who will watch this service in archive if he's not seeing it live brother Eric Arnold will be watching this from France and we want to greet him and wish him a very happy birthday and let him and and sister Fab know that they're always in our prayers and then on Saturday well let me let me mention that on the 8th uh which is Wednesday is brother Emanuel B's uh birthday and he's not with us but he'll be here again you can just know that you'll look up and see him driving in from Kentucky uh be sure to go on Facebook or something and let him know that you wish him a happy birthday and then on Saturday the 11th is Veterans Day and we're thankful very thankful for every person who has ever served in the in the armed forces to give us the freedom that we have and uh especially those we remember at Memorial Day those who gave their lives but Veterans Day we remember all who have served and I like to be thankful for those who are serving Freedom the Battle For Freedom is very much alive would you say that it's not all finished yet and uh you know it's uh it is a sobering thought to think that you and I might be living in the generation of World War I we may very well be living in that generation but God is good he was good in World War I you just here sister alfreda's family's testimony he was good in World War II and he'll take care of you if you'll serve him if you'll give him everything you've got he'll take care of you that's his promise and uh so on that day uh Saturday the 11th we remember the uh event where brother brandham is giving testimony of God's creative power and a little unlearned uneducated woman said that ain't nothing but the truth and the spirit of the Lord fell that day in in sister hadri moser's home and uh uh God gave her the salvation of her boys right before her eyes that reminds us that the bride has Authority by the spoken word to release the spirit of conviction you may not be flowing in the fullness of that Authority but it's coming and that's what's going to be very very important in that hour that we call our loved ones in I'm calling mine in before I leave here you say how's that going to work all it takes is the spirit of conviction and the bride is going to have the authority to release that I'm looking forward to the fullness of that Amelia where is uh Amelia we all mostly know her as Millie but she has a birthday on Saturday and how old will you be sweetie eight years old so that's a new beginning she's just starting over for the next eight so let's wish Amelia a happy birthday Jonathan Hollis will be uh watching this in archive and uh Veterans Day is also his birthday so we send lots of love and greetings and prayers uh for Jonathan and for his family let's just say happy birthday Jonathan and for many years we greeted brother traine and sister Hoyer also on this day for their birthday and for many years we wish brother and sister train a happy anniversary on November the 11th they're in the presence of the Lord I I know what I know you folk believe on Facebook that people have birthdays in heaven I can tell by some of the things you post I want you to know there are no birthdays in heaven it's eternity folks somebody said isn't that sad is it sad I can't think think of anything sad about being in heaven and not having a birthday it's eternity with Jesus no pain no heartache no arthritis come on now oh my we like to remember our love for them on their birthday even though they're gone I get that but but no need to wisht they don't read Facebook they don't have time they they don't they don't look on Instagram to see what you had for dinner when you was on vacation they are in the presence of the Lord I know we do those things for us I get it but just don't get to believe in it you can do it for you but don't get to believe in what you put there because they're busy around the throne gathered with the lamb strolling with the lamb how many of you are looking forward to strolling with the lamb yourself amen I am let me make just a few announcements and that is that next Sunday afternoon after the service we will gather Under the Tent and we will celebrate Thanksgiving as a body of Believers um we are celebrating Thanksgiving every day of Our Lives we must we should but we just don't eat like that every day of Our Lives we must not but uh we're going to be having a wonderful time and we're doing it one week early uh for a couple of reasons one so that I get to be here because I'll be missing the next Sunday and the other thing is hoping that one week will make it a little bit warmer and as I left today remember how cold it was last year um but as I left to come today I thought boy wouldn't today have been a beautiful day to do it but we have to we have to cook we have to get it ready and didn't have time to do that so next Sunday I want to add to what brother gy said by saying that if you you want to continue to designate an offering every month or whenever you feel to uh either as building fund or Campground those funds are together and you can do that in fact since the building has been paid off we have taken everything that has been designated building fund or Campground and put it in a separate account so that it will be there when we start making improvements or when we start building the next or doing whatever it is that God wants us to do so if you want to kind of do that it will be a buffer for for that it'll be there when we start the process because sometimes it takes a little oil to grease the wheel when you start to do something the next project and as long as we can do it as long as we can do it we will make sure that it goes into a separate place so that it can be used and wouldn't that be wonderful for me to come and announce in a in a month or so that the fund has grown to a to an amount that would be substantial and you think my I didn't even you know didn't realize that it was doing that um and we thank God for that and of course you know as soon as the bills as soon as the big debt is paid off the church building that's behind us but you know life is life and the next month's water bill was over $1,000 because of the leak and so expenses are still here so I appreciate what brother gy said we paid it I did I thought I was going to make payments but I didn't have to we we paid it and we're thankful to be able to do that well I'm thankful to be able to do it I wasn't thankful to have to do it I think they ought to show a little Mercy myself nobody drank that water bathed in that water watered their Garden did they none of that it just run down the side of the Hill we're so thankful that the brothers found it when they did and repaired it um Brother David man I know that you don't never do anything for thanks I have learned that about you but Brother David was streaming a service recently where I was lamenting and mentioning a leak and I want you all to know he came to my house two times this week and took care of it and I appreciate it very very [Applause] much one other one other thing I want to mention and that is without any expense to the Church some of the mothers and mothers to be got together and pulled some uh of their finances and their resources and their extra this or that and and last week they remodeled both nurseries they're going to do the bathrooms next uh for the nurseries but they did that as a gift to the body and I think that is absolutely outstanding so all of you who for the last many years have called it purple nursery and yellow Nursery no one is going to know what you're talking about because there is no longer a purple Nursery or a yellow Nursery they are more muted and modern all right now let me tell you that uh we need those nurseries we've got some babies coming we're thinking we might have to knock out a wall and put an extension on the nursery I'm just kidding because God is growing the church in the in the baby in the baby department so let me remind you those of you that don't know the larger Nursery that used to be referred to as the purple Nursery when it was purple that Nursery is for nursing mothers only small children who are nursing small babies who are nursing and mothers who are nursing no brothers no men got it no men in that way one that's for the sisters and those who are nursing babies and we're fixing to have a crop of them or bottle them bottle feeding them or whatever they're doing and then the other little Nursery that's not going to be big enough we realize that is going to have to do is for the Toddlers and for if a dad needs to go in or whatever and help and so forth but we don't ever want there to be any uh uncomfortableness I was told that on occasion some mothers had had to go to the bathroom to nurse because there were men or or boys or something in out I don't want that at all I want them to have a a a safe place and a comfortable place to take care of the babies once we get them here amen isn't that wonderful praise the Lord Josiah come here where's that mic I guess you all are wondering about that gushy testimony he was giving here Tuesday night well now you'll know tell us what you really wanted to tell us Tuesday night well I was very thankful and I'm very excited to announce that Jennifer and I are in the family [Applause] way God has been so good to us through the church family and and everyone who's helped in every way to make our new life together so amazing and so so so much grace God has given and and and we are so thankful for the family we have the advice of all these wonderful mothers that can that can help my wife in this time and I just want to give God the glory and the praise for what he is doing amen amen good job you want did anybody hear the little reference in the testimony to New Life there it goes isn't God good so we really are going to have to add on to the nursery let's stand let's clap our hands for these musicians and thank God for [Applause] them turn in your Bible to uh the the Psalms let's go to Psalm 341 and then to Psalm 844 our subject this morning is becoming the embodiment of Praise becoming the embodiment of Praise I love the songs that were sung this morning and the words that so uh amen what was going to be preached this morning we were singing he is enthroned in our praise and you know that is we know that we know it we understand it we've read it in the book but it's something to really keep us mindful we always want him to be on his throne we always want him to be Lord we want to let him be Lord if he's not Lord of all he's not Lord at all and so by being mindful of Our Praise we become mindful of letting him be Lord over every situation in our life Psalm 34:1 I Will Bless The Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth Psalm 844 blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still praising thee Sila which means pause and think on these things Hebrews 13:15 in the Amplified is the last that we will stand for through him Christ I don't I don't know exactly what that reference is but I'm reading out of the Amplified through through him Christ our high priest therefore let us constantly and at all all times offer up to God a sacrifice of praise which is the fruit of lips that thankfully acknowledge and confess and glorify his name I want to read that again through him Christ our high priest therefore let us constantly and at all times offer up to God a sacrifice of praise which is the fruit of lips that thankfully acknowledge and confess and glorify his name I'm going to read one more habc chapter 3 if you'll go there habac chapter 3 verse 17-9 and then we'll let you have your seats I love this I've ministered this before but I love it it's it's good to me although the Fig Tree shall not blossom neither shall fruit be in the vines the labor of the olives shall fail and the fields shall yield no meat the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there shall be no herd in the Stalls yet oh Hallelujah yet sir did you know there was so much

upon mine high places every person is appointed some high places in their spiritual life and God wants to equip you for walking through your spiritually high places to the chief singer of my stringed instruments father we thank thank you today that you are calling a bridal company to be the embodiment of Praise it's not what we do only but it's also who you have called us to be you have called us to be praised you have caused us and called us to be worship that's who we are it's part of the reason why we are here we ask you to help us today to be able to concentrate and focus on your word to be reminded of both the privilege of praise and the responsibility of Praise it's not just the gift you give us but it's also the gift that you require of us so may we be faithful in our duty as praisers may we be faithful in our duty as worshippers may we be faithful to live a life that is worthy of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ we can only do that by your grace we can only do that because of your mercy bless now our time in your word and we will give you praise and honor and glory for it's in the name above every name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah we pray and the Saints said amen you may be seated praise is more than music it's more than singing Praise is a powerful weapon if you always want to win in your life you have to cultivate an attitude of gratitude if you always want to win in every battle of your life you have to cultivate and attitude of praise and of worship I want to share with you a quote from Mrs Francis metf I don't know if you are familiar with that name but she was a a prayer meeting leader she led a prayer meeting in in Idlewood uh California and up in the kind of in the mountainous regions just north of the of the high desert of Lancaster and for many years in the 50s and early 60s there was a group of women who met together in prayer and their experiences are documented in several recorded testimonies the things that God did among them no church no Pastor just women who wanted to be useful in the kingdom of God no gossip can you imagine in that no long drawn out prayer requests camouflaged as gossip our gossip camouflaged as long informational prayer request they just came to lift up God they come to be used of the Lord and uh I met a man one time in Tucson Who as a young boy was invited to attend the meeting and the night that he was there he told me with his own mouth I have no reason to doubt his testimony he's no longer alive but I have no reason to doubt his testimony he said that in the middle of the room while they were praying a door appeared every eye in that group saw that door and heard the voice that said come through here now what would you do would you get up and try to get through the door or would you be so terrified you couldn't get up out of your seat somebody said I don't believe in things like that doesn't matter what you believe in it doesn't keep it from being real the Supernatural is real I'm telling you it's real demons are real but so are angels so don't spend all your time focusing on demons spend a little of that time focusing on the other host there are more for us there's more forces fighting for you than there are against you somebody said well there 10,000 time 10,000 demon spirit all right there's hundreds of thousands times hundreds of thousands Heavenly hosts that are fighting for you if our spiritual eyes could be open we would see the room even now filled with creatures created to assist the body of Christ in this hour they don't all look the same they don't all function the same but God gives them to us when we need them and you know when I need them all all the time I don't ever dismiss my angels I don't ever send them home for Furlow I don't ever tell them they can have a break I need them with me 24 hours a day they take a lot of blows that I don't even know are headed in my direction they stop a lot of things that I don't even know are going around in the realm of the spirit I'm thankful for the heavenly host for every demon God's got a dozen Angels or more who know how to deal with that imp and they are sent to cooperate with us they are here to serve us they are here to minister to us they are here to help us do what God has called us to do we don't pray to angels and we don't command Angels the Lord is the commander of the Heavenly Host he sends the angels it's all right to say father would you send your angels into such of a situation you're asking you're petitioning you're requesting I don't believe it's our job to tell what Angel to go where and to do what and so forth God is a big God but I want you to be aware of the fact that every time you are aware that something is fighting against you you ought to immediately remember that with every attack against you there is a Heavenly ho raised up to meet that challenge stay out of their way anybody with me stay out of their way they don't really need your help they just need you moving with them they can get the job done these ladies were were uh their like I said their testimonies were written James Mahoney uh wrote ladies of gold is that what it was called he wrote two volumes uh some of the things that they saw and some of the things they experienced in prayer and I know that happened outside of our of our camp but it happened in the 50s when everything that we hold dear in our camp was taking place and I wouldn't I wouldn't doubt but what God was using those women to help clear things and to push things back so that he could do what he needed to do in the earth during that time I want to read you two quotes I don't feel at all uncomfortable to do it from from Mrs Francis medf she wrote in the 1950s recently the Lord whispered these words to me I want you to become praise personified how this thought took took possession of me to become an embodiment of Praise in the earth oh listen a temple filled with his glory me me somebody said that was the Lord speaking to her it was indeed and the reason why she shared it is because she recognized it wasn't just her calling amen she wanted you and I to understand that we could also identify with that calling to become praise personified she said how this thought took possession of me is there anybody in this room you've ever had a thought a revelation something that was spoken in the spirit that took a hold of you that possessed you you couldn't get it off your mind you couldn't ignore it you couldn't dismiss it that's what she's saying this thought I want you to become praise personified it took possession of me to become an embodiment of Praise in the earth that that's going to require something I'm going to preach I'm going to preach whether you help me or not it's going to require something of you it's going to require something of me if I become the embodiment of Praise in the Earth the first thing I want you to remember is bitter and Sweet Water amen cannot come out of the same sistern I I want you to remember that that this is a little member but it boasteth much and it can get you and I in a whole lot of trouble the Bible tells us that ships you know they have Rudders there they ways of controlling the ship uh but all this little thing right here it's hard for Man by himself yes to tame this thing I say by himself because the only way it can really be tamed is by the help of the Holy Ghost you've got to make the discipline for yourself and you're never I'm never me let me just preach about me I'm never I am never going to become the embodiment of Praise in the earth as long as there's bitter water and sweet water coming out of my mouth I'm going to have to arrest my criticisms I'm going to have to arrest my judgments I'm going to have to arrest my prejudices and I'm going to have to let the Lord help me control oh how powerful this is how powerful this is when I yield my tongue to the leadership of the Holy Spirit I have the ability to create what is not in existence when I yield my tongue to the enemy I then operate in the ability to destroy what I have created now how terrible is the thought that I could spend a portion of my life building up something by yielding my mouth to the King of Kings to the Holy Ghost and then in 10 minutes or less destroy with the same instrument no wonder the Apostle said if I my if I become a Castaway if I myself should become a Castaway I do all that I know to do and yet in a moment refus to trust the Lord like ASA the king who trusted the Lord with everything except the Affliction in his foot then he leaned on the arms of man and the Bible said and then he died he slept with his fathers because he was always trusting in the lord always believing that God could deliver him in every situation ation and then all of a sudden instead of running to God as his resource I'm preaching this morning instead of running to God as his resource he leaned on the arms of Flesh and died an Affliction that was no more than than than what we would call tendonitis acute achilles tendonitis some of you know I know what that's about that's all it was it had no reason to take his life but he leaned on the arm of Flesh in the moment when he had always gone to God so it's very very possible that we can destroy what we build we cooperate with God we yield our tongue to the Holy Spirit and we build up something or somebody and in a moment of anger I'm going to preach I know there's some V few visitors here but I'm going to preach come on Amen than and then in a few moments of time let the enemy rise up in [Music] me destroy what God's been using me to build now how many of you really realize In This Moment how easy that really would be it's happened brother I know I know so many that that are walking right now in the in the Lion's lay where where there is nothing but but bleach bones of Revival's past they spend their entire Ministry now only bragging about what God did 30 years ago their testimonies are all ancient they're right they're good they're holy they're precious but where is the god of Elijah [Applause] today you see I found myself in that Lion's liar one time and I looked around and I saw those bleached bones of Rev ral's past of movements past of what God had done in the past and I realized that somebody had let down the bar and allowed the enemy to so gnaw away at what God wanted to accomplish that there was nothing left but just tattered pieces of skin and bones that had been left over from past real holy things real powerful things really anointed things that God had done you better hear me folks you better hear me today if you and I are ever going to become the embodiment of Praise we're going to have to watch our tongue we're going to have to watch the words that come out of our mouth there's life or death in this tongue we can build and destroy in the same moment with this tongue hello so that's the first thing we've got to deal with if I'm going to become the embodiment of Praise then I can't curse and bless I've got to choose my way I've got to choose my way come on now I can't praise and complain I can't be thankful and grumbling at the same time murmuring 40 years 40 years 40 years that's right you know I had an experience recently that I haven't shared but I saw us again in the spirit coming to Kadesh barnea and I said to the people in this experience this time we don't ever have to go around this mountain again and I looked up and there was a small group of us that had already gone ahead I called to them whoa whoa what are you doing what are you doing why are you leaving us ahead the Lord said we don't have to go around this mountain again it was like the it was like the shuffle they had done it so so often and for so long they had circled the mountain and they had taken another lap around the mountain that they thought well even though we're saying out to them you don't have to do it God said this is the crossing overtime this is time to possess the inheritance we don't have to take another lap in the desert but some were all the way up ahead and the experience ended I'm calling to them come back to us come back to us come back to us when I had that experience I realized that we were going to have to watch the signpost very very carefully we're going to have to watch what God is doing we're going to have to watch what God is saying we're going to have to cooperate with the Holy Ghost like never before or the enemy will divide us and he'll divide us and though we're all sincere I want you to understand though we're all sincere these people that were pulling away they weren't pulling away from us they were sincere they were just stuck they just couldn't accept I want to tell you something your attitude on while you wait come on your attitude while you wait on God your attitude on while you wait on God to bring his word to pass is vitally important for the measure of your promise for the measure of your Harvest if you wait and Grumble if you wait and murmur if you wait and make excuses for your life one day I'm going to serve him with everything I've got you don't get to choose that now is the time now is the acceptable hour to have a relationship with him I mean a personal relationship with him where your desire is to overcome and make it and your desire for those around you is that they also overcome and make it the day of gloating when someone else is stuck the day of gloating when someone else is having a struggle the day of gloating when someone else is spinning their wheel that day is over brother that day is over sister we've got to rejoice when others rejoice and weep when others weep we've got to realize that in order for the bride to become the embodiment of praise to release the creative word of God into the Earth to shift atmospheres I want you to know I feel very responsible for what's happened in this in this uh County I feel very responsible for what's happened I took it upon myself I'm not going to to uh belabor it until it brings me into depression no no I don't mean that but I truly believe that you and I can produce such an anointing with our praise with our amens with our worship that we bring a purity to this community we bring a purity to this County I realize the devil is wild and I realize he's going to take a hold of whoever will yield to him but I just can't stand the thought that on our what my watch my watch that kind of ugly sin could creep right in to our little Community uh with someone so respected a a and so and has done so many wonderful things for our community as a whole it it disturbs me it bothers me it has caused me to pray more it's caused me to be a little more sober it's caused me to want to be careful what I say about him about the situation about the things that happen I want to watch over my heart I want to stay on my lips I want to raise up to be who God has called us to be we are Watchmen of righteousness we have authority in the realm of the spirit over this place and in order to become the embodyment of Praise we're going to have to be careful I'm going to have to be careful what I think what I say how I criticize others come on I realize that the only True Deliverance in Satan's Eden is going to be where the revealed word is but I happen to believe the revealed word is in this house I happen to believe that the spirit of conviction ought to be so real in [Music] here brother that we would be so quick to repent that we would be so quick a husband would be so quick to go to his wife a wife would be so quick to go to her husband to say honey I've been entertaining thoughts that are not of God and I just wanted you to know so that you'll pray for me we ought to have such an atmosphere here that Satan can't just come in walk down the aisle and sit right down among us and have himself a cup of tea we ought to be creating such an atmosphere here that the only thing an enemy could do would be cry out for help if a demon Spirit were to walk in this place I would want to have such an atmosphere here that he couldn't just Nestle in Among Us I would want him exposed and called out some of you don't know some of the things that have transpired here over the years but God has been good to us I discerned a spirit some years ago that had that had fallen on someone who had uh come and was coming quite regular at the time that so Disturbed me and so alarmed me that I went to prayer and I said Lord I want you to bring Deliverance to that man I want you to bring Deliverance to him I want you to give him another opportunity and another opportunity and another opportunity to have Deliverance because I'm very very concerned about the way that he watches the girls and especially the little girls I'm very very concerned about that and God began to deal with my heart and it wasn't what I wanted to do I wanted to pray him to the altar I wanted to pray him to help but instead my prayers put him out from the body and uh I didn't want to expose him in the hour I didn't want to go around and talk about him I didn't want people to change their minds so many people revered him and loved him and and and and liked him so much and wanted to fellowship with him and so I just left it at that but I could not be silent when it come to doing something about it in prayer I want us all to be so sensitive in this this hour because we need to understand that that evil has come to this [Applause] country I I know you saw where they where they captured someone arrested someone and uh trying someone who had come from from uh from the Palestinians who had come across the border there in Mexico and they found in investigating and talking to him that that it looks like there was a plot that was going to be made against Jewish people in our nation and they tell us that there's another between 7 and 10,000 on on Parade to the border right now maybe you've seen some of the of the aerial shots I have walking to the Border where every one of them will be processed every one of them will be given an opportunity except the Goda ways and the Goda ways are those who run across without any real permission who sneak across who pull away who don't get shot you know there are certain situations in certain Nations that would that would cost a man his life if he crossed a border and started running there there are certain situations and Nations that would say we can't afford we don't know what he's about but we can't afford to risk when there's a legal way we can't afford to let him come in illegally without any kind of Investigation a and and I know demonically we we knew years ago and learned years ago that demonic what had been assigned to other nations and had been such strongholds in other nations would now visit this nation and the level of demonic possession that was known in the dark continent of Africa or in island nations like vanatu and some of those places where where witch doctors and and and uh those kinds of uh of you know whatever you call call them have so surrendered themselves to demonic possession that demons control every step they make well I want you to know that kind of evil is in this nation that kind of demonic power is in this nation and the bride Church can't play When the church is playing the church is playing yes the church is playing denominations are playing but the bride can't play there can't be any playing in here no sir we've got to be as serious as possible because you may be the one I may be the one that God uses to stop something and I appreciate every person who arms himself I appreciate those who who arm themselves in here I don't mind that I'm I'm for that I'm not against that but I want you to know there would be no reason for any of us to think that the kind of demonic power that's that's happening that's present in the Earth today there's no reason that any of us should think that a gun can stop that that's right you could only take out the house that evil was living in but the spirit would find another way somebody said are you trying to make somebody fearful no I'm trying to make somebody prayerful on I want people to be prayerful and I want you to be careful what you let upset you I want you to be careful what you get involved in I want you to choose your conversations more wisely yes sir if you're in a conversation and you're uncomfortable move come on go excuse yourself you don't have to participate in a conversation especially with Believers that you're not comfortable with leave just say I I I'm done I I don't I don't want to talk I don't want to hear it I don't want to be in the middle of that do it nice don't be sanctimonious be humble be honest just say I know how things affect me I I might really be ugly if I let that get down in my heart so I can't afford to do that I is anybody helping me and I'm going to preach anyway I'm taking my extra hour too by the way you thought it was for you to sleep didn't you no sir on there's people all over the nation praying for you today you you are pray prayed up People Prayed For People CU When I posted that little joke I had inboxes I had about 30 inboxes brother Shelly said I know you you're just looking for any opportunity to preach another hour they didn't have to change the clock they they didn't have to do that you're just looking for any chance and maybe I'm I am especially when I know I got something to say I've got something to say today I want to become the embodiment of Praise in the earth I want everything about me to scream Jesus come on it's going to take that kind of radical living to shake up the world to bring the last harvest in to get us out of here she said I want you said the voice said to her I want you to become praise personified let's see it how this thought took possession of me to become an embodiment of Praise in the earth a temple know you not yes that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost and everything you sit under and everything you listen to and everything you let in the eye gate is going to affect the temple you can't be a Temple of Praise a temple of glory and a temple of Darkness at the same time come on a temple filled with his glory by day by and even when it's needed the most at night when the enemy likes to work you may think I've lost my mind but there's a certain time for people to be at home you may think I'm a fanatic there's a certain time for people to be at home I don't know what that time is for you but there's a certain time that Christian people full of the light aren't roaming up and down the alleys of this world come on there's a time for us to come home there's a time for us to be safe there's a time for us to be with our families come on I don't believe in in my in myself I don't believe that God's people should be roaming around all hours of the night we are children of the day we are children of the light God make me a temple filled by with your glory day and by night let me be on guard let me watch myself if you know brother sister that there's a vulnerability in your life you better guard it if the enem is trying to use Facebook or some social media to cause you to enter in to an emot affair with someone who is not your companion you better cut that stuff out get off of that you know who you are you know I know me you know you if you have a vulnerability in that area something causes your eye to wonderand your mind to wander I've watched Brothers in this church unnecessarily watch other women I don't know but what a sister might be a sciss or two do the same but I've not don't say no you don't know maybe you don't but you can't speak for everybody else the devil I tell you if you if you're one of those people that think only men struggle with sexual sin you're l thank you I believe I will there's no reason there's no reason for any brother to watch somebody else's wife watch yours you chose her if she don't do it for you anymore you need to do some praying amen you need to pray until she does but you need to keep your eyes off of somebody else's this is an hour where the enemy will come in and he will get in any way he can he'll use anybody that will yield themselves to him and we can't become praise personified if we're becoming lust personified anybody with me I know I know you've never been to a funeral where anybody ever left the funeral thinking that there was any possibility that the dead person didn't go to heaven most of us have never attended a funeral where excuse wasn't made for the dead if every person that died went to heaven there wouldn't be any reason for you and I to to walk the walk we're walking I don't believe in universalism I don't believe that everybody's saved I don't believe because you're a lockable guy a good Old redneck guy that you're going to inherit the kingdom of God I don't even believe because you've taken up money for others in need that means you're going to have eternal life there's only one way to have eternal life that's through the grace and the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and that blood cleanses us from all unrighteousness and from all sin that blood delivers us if we yield to it I'm looking for a body I'm looking for a body he's saying I'm looking for a people come on now that will embody praise that's right their lives will become worship their lives will become praised let me read the next part of of her quote he said uh I saw she said excuse me I saw that heaven is indeed filled with his praise and glory it is here on Earth that praise is lacking his glory limited here it seems that above all things he desires habitations not just microphones habitations of Praise does that seem biblical to you he said pure praise True Praise fervent praise now I can be his praise kept coming to me this this thought now I can be his praise kept coming to me not only to not only to offer praise to practice praise but what be prais to be praised how can you be praised when your life is magnifying the Lord when your testimony and your life matches when what you say and what you do just just a minute Amen brother when when your walkie walkie lines up with your talkie talkie yeah I'm going slow down when your walkie walking can line up with your talkie-talkie you can be praised how many of you'd rather be praise and just do praise it can be holler doing praise can be holla yeah we need it we got to have it it builds an atmosphere but for you personally for you personally you can walk out of here Hollow there you've served the body and you've helped create with the sincerest praise you could do you have helped create an atmosphere and then yet you walk out of here Hollow because you weren't just created to do praise to offer praise to practice praise you were created to be praised no comp compromise no compromise compromise is the Trojan Horse of the end time Church come on now he don't March in the front door and say you ought to change such and such but he comes in subtle are you mad brother Shelly not at all do I seem mad are you directing that at anybody I am everybody every stream or two anybody that'll be quiet and listen I'm directing it to every one of you because I know that God is also talking to my heart Psalm 22:3 if you'll put that up but Thou Art holy I'm almost through a page one but Thou Art holy oh thou that inhabited you live in yes you are enthroned by yes sir the Praises of Israel amen somebody read me somebody open your Bible to Psalm 22 and read me one and two I don't I don't know if we we'll send the mic just read the two verses I didn't have them there Ellas you think you can do it they'll they might even can put them up for you there read one and two for me would you I want you to see the context I read for you verse three but Thou Art holy oh thou that inhabit us the Praises of Israel but I want you to hear that this is a prophecy David has entered into the spirit of Prophecy while he was praising while he was singing praises while he was writing Praises he has entered into the spirit of Prophecy and not only into the spirit of Prophecy he has entered into the very Spirit of Christ and he has started prophesying what the Messiah would one day say powerful can you imagine e excuse me can you imagine getting so lost in the spirit that words would begin to come out of your mouth that would be future words that the king would say when he shows up can you imagine such a blessing read it for us Elias verse one and two please my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me does that sound familiar to you do you remember that that's what he said while he was dying on the cross my God my God why why hast Thou forsaken me read on why art thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring why aren't you coming to help me why Don't You Hear My Cries of desperation read on oh my God I cry in the daytime but thou hearest not and in the night's season I am not silent and am not silent oh my God I cry in the daytime but thou hearest not and in the night season and am not silent but look at what the next verse says but Thou Art holy are you listening to me today you can have negative thoughts you're a human being you can have them anybody had any you can have NE ative thought you you can even have a thought that says God just doesn't seem fair you can have that thought you can you're a human being you have every right to think anything that you want to think but we're going to have to learn from the men of the book cuz they had them too job had them too job cursed God curs didn't curse God excuse me cursed the day he was born his wife wanted him to curse God and die he cursed the day he was born yes he he cursed his circumstances he cursed what he was going in and he sounded for a while like a man forsaken but he didn't stay in that place oh he said I wish I had a pin of iron that I could write these words I know five minutes before you didn't sound like you [Music] knew but now I know Oh My Redeemer [Applause] living I know he does so we went from cursing the day he was born to knowing that his redeemer live his true self which one was Joe both of them were job but who was the real job I know that my redeemer liveth what was talking a minute ago the trials were talking the fire was talking the heartache was talking the grief was talking the loss was talking it's all right sometimes it'll talk but you've got to recognize the sound you've got to recognize what it sounds like when it starts coming out of your mouth and you've got to make sure you bring everything right back to the goodness of God but Thou Art holy now who's saying this this is Christ that's right on this is powerful this is Christ can you imagine Christ remember that God we serve is 100% God and he was 100% man sir there's no other explanation for the godhead that fits every verse of the Bible there's no other explanation of the godhead that fits every other verse of the Bible he could not have been half God and half man couldn't have served could couldn't have serve the purpose for which he was intended if he was 50% God and 50% man somebody said how could anything be 100% God and 100% man didn't you hear God say I'm going to do something that's never been done before I'm going to send a creation that's never been sent before he's going to come in a way that's never come before I'm only going to borrow her body she's not even going to produce the egg I'm going to just borrow her body like an incubator she's going give him warmth she's going to nurture him like a mama but that's that that I'm going to do in her is not coming from her it's not coming from Joseph I'm going to place an egg in her belly I'm going to fertilize that egg by the Holy Ghost and what's going to come out from her loins is going to be 100% God and 100% man he's going to baffle the world he's going to baffle his neighbors he's going to baffle his contemporaries he's going to baffle theologians yes he they're going to try to cut him up into to two or three but it's not going to work because here oh Israel the Lord our God is one is one and so here God steps on the scene John 1 steps on the scene God made flesh and dwelt Among Us so he's hanging there on the cross and kinosis is taking place that part of him that was God is pulling away it had to be so only the man could die but God couldn't die does that baffle anybody it seems real simple to me the god couldn't die only the humanity could die right so the spirit of God begin to pull away from him and the and the loss and the grief that he was feeling somebody said it's like a husband losing his wife life because he feels like she's a part of him that's the closest thing that we could that we could compare it to but it's not enough it's not enough because a husband may lose his wife but he doesn't lose the god of his salvation here was a body that had functioned 100% man 100% God and now the god part of him was pulling and he was emptying himself of the god part of who he was it's really really powerful when you understand you'll get it right if you just run all the scriptures together and all the quotes together and here he's dying like that and he's crying out I'm crying in the daytime you're not hearing me I'm I'm crying I'm roaring at night and you're not hearing me let's look at it again Psalm 221 and2 why hast Thou forsaken me why art thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring oh oh my God I cry in the daytime but thou hearest not and in the ninth season and am not silent but Thou Are Holy hly the man is talking to the God just like we read in the Bible the God sometimes spoke to the man Thou Art my son come take your place with me this is the man crying out to the God but Thou Art holy yes yes oh thou that inhabited the Praises of Israel let me read verse three in the Amplified But You Are Holy oh you who dwell in the Holy place where the Praises of Israel are offered let me read it in the complete Jewish Bible is anybody still with me my God by day I will call to you but you don't answer likewise at night but I get no relief remember this was the man crying out to the god nevertheless oh I wished you were with me I wish you were with me right now nevertheless You Are Holy read it [Music] enthroned the Lord is enthroned on the Praises of Israel that's why your Praises are so important because as long as he sits in your praise as long as he inhabits and lives in your praise he is Lord he's Lord he's Lord of every circumstance he's Lord of every situation but when you allow the enemy to arrest your tongue and you use it for judgment cursing and prejudices you're absolutely taking him off the Throne of your life you you can't change thank you Stephen I heard that you can't change the fact that he's sitting on the throne Eternal you can't change the fact that he's still king of kings and Lord of lords but when you're not giving him a place to sit when you're not building him a house to live in when you're not making him a habitation to dwell in you're taking him off his throne in your life that's and if you think the Throne of your life is going to sit empty there's a dozen other entities anybody with me there's a dozen other entities just waiting for an opportunity to take up the Throne of your life to be Lord over every situation your flesh you don't have to go looking for a devil your flesh would like to sit on the throne oh yeah you know that oos sari flesh we live in the one that says I think I'll take a I I need a little break from church that's not the Holy Ghost talking to you that's your sorry flesh I just can't stand to be around people I just think I have to stay home today I just that ain't God talking to you that ain't the Holy Ghost talking to you that's your sorry rotten flesh we don't need a demon to come sit on the throne there's a flesh man there's a nature within us that'll take up that place if we let him and he'll start ruling your life he'll start CH running you around town at his bidding hello brother where's Joshua come here a minute please yeah get me a bottle of water would you honey and take a big sip out of it reach down in the in the pocket of the front of my uh briefcase and pour one of those packets in the water and Shake It Up good and bring it to me please thank you so much I appreciate it so much my God by day I will call to you but you don't answer likewise at night but I get no relief nevertheless You Are Holy here's a broken Twisted body hanging on the cross sir why why are you leaving me now I need you more than I've ever needed you before why are you leaving me now nevertheless yes sir my papa You Are Holy and you are enthroned on the Praises of Israel you're not coming down even if I perish here right even if I die here and even never toise again you're still God over Israel as long as she's praising you you see why the devil hates your praise you see why the devil want you focused on somebody else's flag waving instead of focused on your praise because he absolutely wants to take God off the throne in your life and the only way he can do it is to go against your praise when When Praise when when people have come to this message of Truth and we've allowed the preachers to talk us out of a of a of a living experience with God and a real Holy Ghost worship service when we've allowed things like that thank you so much when we've allowed things like that to happen we have absolutely allowed God to slip off the Throne of our life he's no longer enthroned in our life because our Praises are quenched and our Praises are silenced and we've looked around at everybody else I I I I want to remind you that Pentecost is not a swear word it's an experience yes sir I threw this verse in because it says so much I ran across it by accident Isaiah 57 15 it's 1:00 good praise God we're doing good I got two hours left for thus saith the high and lofty one the spirit of prophecy on Isaiah for thus sayith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity amen whose name is Holy holy listen to this this is power I love this I dwell in the high and holy place but I don't dwell there alone hear it I'm not there by myself I dwell in the high and holy place with him also listen I didn't even know this verse was in the Bible it about knock me I know I've read it it almost knocked me off my chair this morning I was looking up in habitus and this popped up whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble Spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to to revive the heart of the contrite ones now real preacher could preach on that for an hour can you imagine realizing that the god of Eternity dwells in a high and holy place but he's not there alone every person who walks before him with a contrite and humble heart with a contrite and humble Spirit you dwell with him in high and holy places he'll make your feet like hind feet you dwell with him in high and holy places and you're there in cooperation to bring Revival to the spirit of the humble bring them in Lord bring them in bring them in oh God let us cooperate with you to see the Humble Hearts loosed from the house of hell yes Lord yes Lord loose from the bondage of religion Lord loose from the denomination of the message come on and to revive the heart of the contrite ones there's one thing about it you're not humble and you're not contrite when you're running everybody else to the dogs oh that wasn't enough come on that wasn't near enough you can't be humble and contrite and bitter and critical and judgmental come on now you're going to have to learn to love one another you don't seem to have any problem doing it in your family then why won't you do it in God's Family come on you've got that old crazy uncle you've got that strange ant nobody else ought to have to put up with her but you but you've learned to do it because she's Family come on you've learned to make the best out of Thanksgiving that's right cuz you know she's coming with all of her weirdness you know he's coming with all of his Stranges and drama and whatever he bring but he's family and you can't do it often but you do it on occasion because it's family anybody going to help me you're going to have to learn to do that with God's family we're not all going to look just alike act just alike we're not all going to be right all the time fact nobody's going to be right all the time we're going to bring our idiosyncrasies we're going to bring our bumps and warts and crooked toes and whatever else but we're going to have to learn that there's only one way to get a body change there's only one way to get out of this life only one way it's going to take perfect love you can't manufacture perfect love but you can understand it so that you begin to practice it and you don't practice perfect love on somebody easy to [Music] love you find the challenge yes sir Devils cannot stand before the weapon of real sincere praise Thrones topple principalities are brought low praise and power go ever hand in hand I'm finished these two things act and react upon each other constantly praise and power True Praise releases power and true power inspires more sincere praise do you understand yes sir if you want Power with God we need Authority it's ours but if you want to see Power on display praise him not just with your song with your life not with just with your mouth with your life is anybody with me yes sir habach 3 I want to go back to that and and bring it kind of to a close habac 3:17 although the Fig Tree shall not blossom neither shall fruit be in the vines the labor of the olives shall fail and the field shall yield no meat the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there shall be no heard in the Stalls somebody's in bad shape Israel's suffering but what did habach the prophet say yet my goodness my goodness when the cow ain't giv any milk yet I will praise when you get the church property paid off and $1,000 water bill shows up in the the mail yet right yet I will praise come on now you get one rotten tooth [Music] fixed and another kid says I'm hurting yet I will praise come on you get in the car on now you hear a noise that sounds more like a weed eater than a motor real motor car [Music] motor I'll tell you it sounds that way in my house a lot because uh we we go through we go through uh what do you call them honey those mixers we go through kitchen AE like some people go through I I don't know butter dishes or something my wife finally said they just don't make them like they used to make them cuz my grand had the same one for nearly 40 years we've had at least four since we were married and right now the one we got it it Mariah's got a big bread order coming about 50 60 loaves she's got a make over the course of the next few days and I wonder every time I hear that thing I wonder if that's the last loaf it'll go yet I will praise the Lord come on you you know I don't know what you've dealt with this week I can only tell you my little thing I don't know what you've dealt with this week but you know yes sir you you pay off one bill and then the washer goes out you pay for the refrigerator and get a new refrigerator when you can and something else has to be replaced that's right old Ramsey don't tell you how to fix that he tells you how to make an emergency fund what do you do when you use your emergency fund and you got another emergency yet that's when you have to get in yet yet I will rejoice in the Lord I will Joy in the god of my salvation war and Devastation had shrouded the land of Judah the calans were about to take over the city of Jerusalem the walls of Jerusalem were about to be breached by this powerful enemy the Temple of Solomon was about to be defiled the country was sitting on the precipice of ruin the flocks were being raided by roving bands of rustlers the Farmland was no longer being cultivated because of sloth and drought Josiah's Godly reforms were being entirely overturned by joakim's Wicked rule nothing was looking good the fig tree blossoms had not come out the fruit of the vine in the trees failed to materialize the olive trees had failed to give out the oil the fields Barren and no produce is found there the flocks have been cut off from the fold due to the neglect of the Shepherds if there was ever a reason to moan to groan anybody with me the people in this day yet I will rejoice in the Lord I will joy in the god of my salvation Matthew Henry a famous famous commentator he describes This Joy there as a holy fear and a holy Joy I will I will have holy fear and holy Joy at the same time and joy isn't a byproduct of an easy life it's a response to God's never changing character when our even when our circumstances don't change that hind that we were talking about a moment ago is referring to a female deer or mountain goat that can place their back feet exactly where her front feet stepped one of the only creatures in God's kingdom that can do a thing like that and do it quickly and carefully without a whole lot of thought they climb put their front feet there and can pull their back feet up put them in the exact same spot while their front Feet's reaching for the next place I stood at the bottom of Angy just near the Dead Sea we were there one particular time I think it was when the when the Ibex were were in mating season and so there were many of them and they were very very active and I watched some of the biggest ibcs you've ever seen in your life way up on the precipice of a mountain and they were climbing a a place where the mountain went straight like that and you know they weren't creeping up they were amazingly going with Leaps and Bounds to the top of that mountain I saw one slip one time I lost my breath I was watching this big old thing with them big beautiful horns and and and it looked like he was about to uh slip and all of a sudden he did slip and his foot went out from under him and I thought oh no he there's nowhere for him to land except at the bottom but he found a place and I want to tell you something he didn't catch your with his front foot neither one of his front feet caught him he caught himself with his back legs and when I saw that I'm sitting there thinking this must be what the writer meant I will make your feet like hind feet among high places it means very surefooted did you know a lifestyle of Praise can make you very surefooted anybody with me he does not always change our circumstances immediately when we pray sometimes our challenges are heartaches and pains are still there but often our strength is found in Walking on depending on him and giving him praise in in in all things I love that little tiny word yet all of these all those that represent uncertainties are followed by a crescendo of yet I will praise I Will Rejoice one more verse of one more place of scripture here before we go Psalm 149 I need you to read it for me ellias Psalm 149 this is very familiar we just read this last week I want you to read the first six verses you everybody still good it's 11:16 I know that before the clock went back it would be 2:16 and we'd be getting out read brother praise ye the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of saints let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their King uh-huh let them praise His name in the dance in the dance let them sing praises unto him with the timberl and harp thought we weren't supposed to use instruments in church for the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation remember that's not Revlon and Max Factor ashad that is salvation read on let the Saints be joyful in glory joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon their beds that doesn't mean snoring that means praising let the high praises of God let the high praises of God be in their mouth read elas and a two-edged sword in their hand that word high guess what it means it means High it means a lifting up the exaltation of God by his holy people rising up lifting up raising up so let the high praises it also means an advanced it means advanced in complexity or elaboration like when they say higher mathematics higher mathematics that's that's above 2 plus two higher praise or High Praise means praise that is above and beyond you still with me it's above and beyond praise the Lord right praise the Lord I come to church this morning praise the Lord I doubt it so I went to the Lexicon I've I've shared this with you before I'm almost reluctant to share it with you because I don't want to make you Fanatics and some of you run in that direction and the guilty said amen but I cannot help brother Daniel not to share these words because it just don't sound like the average service around the message these are not just words I pulled up out of the dictionary these are these are uh synonyms from the Lexicon these are other words used for High Praise tall praise sister Megan even you can offer tall praise it's not talking about your stature sir it's talking about to the extent or to the degree tall praise how long has it been since you've offered God tall praise quit reading ahead acute remember I told you that I had for years I suffered with acute achilles tendonitis that's what the doctor called it because brother when it wasn't there it wasn't there but when it was there it was there it was acute it was it was powerfully present High Praise is tall praise High Praise is acute praise not a twinge of praise fullblown praise shill it's going to get quiet in here this is supposed to make you noisy not not quiet shill I didn't make that up sometimes my left ear suffers after being in church with you all I don't know what's right what what's going on in my left ear but it's it's sensitive to noise I'm not out here more than two minutes before my watch is telling me you are at decb that are dangerous to sustain and then sometimes that glorious War shout war cry comes and it is shill and sometimes you see me I've had people tell me they see me it stops up my ear so I do like that not to shut out the pray to open up my ear I'm not complaining it's High Praise High Praise piercing lofty Grand yes on now somebody give me a flag come here Michaela gra me one of these it's all right sister Sharon if I borrow one of these no not the pink one thank you so much you're so precious to do that is this one all right sister Sharon notice what it said it didn't say low praise come on high flown I know this get some of you move your head come on I want you flaggers to use some wisdom I don't want you to take nobody's head off or loosen the glue of their tupe I want you to use wisdom but I also want the rest of you to understand if you're going to do it come on it's supposed to be high flown just watch just watch my critics will take the still shot of [Applause] this and just so you know we didn't meet before church to decide what color we were going to fly thank you so much I I I preached a message during camp meeting on tongues and I tried to set the record straight and I called it the bride's advantage and do you know there are people who heard it and their their take on it was he's preaching basically that tongues is the initial evidence Not only was I not preaching that I didn't ever preach it that's what made me quite unusual in Assemblies of God because it's one of the tenants of their faith tongues is the is the initial evidence of the B ISM of the Holy Ghost but I had seen too many Devils talking tongues I'd seen too many child abusers I'd seen too many men run off of other people's W wives while they were talking in tongues so I knew that just because somebody talked in t but do you see how the devil hears and how he twist things and he wouldn't do that if if a prayer language if if Saints being able to intercede in tongues the devil wouldn't fight it if it wasn't where her Victory [Applause] lies he wouldn't hate it so much I didn't say it was but I did say what brother random said anybody who receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost will speak in tongues at some point or [Music] another that don't sound like initial evidence to me that's right lofty High flown wait a minute High flown exalted elevated raised [Applause] heightened that's what I like to talk about high price praise I don't know what your praise has cost you come on but I know what my praise has cost me hello I don't know what yours has cost you but I know the price of mine and it's valuable to me because the battle was hard come on the suffering was hard the trial was hard so the praise ought to match the intensity of the fire hallelujah hallelujah my praise ought to match the intensity of my [Music] trial you don't really believe that everybody ought to praise the Lord like that do you I didn't write this book let the high let the high praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand remember we're not preaching on worship sir I'm preaching on praise and I don't care what the charismatics say until they learn the beauty of Praise they may call it worship all day long but that don't make it worship you've got to learn you've got to learn the tool you've got to learn the tool of praise you've got to learn the effectiveness of High Praise it's got to become a revelation to you and you've got to get in that place so that the glory comes that's what breaks open the atmosphere but you don't want to live there you want to come on in without a without a proper progression the the atmosphere is not properly uh created for the word to go forth praise breaks open the heaven worship lets the heaven come down it works together praise is going to be tall and acute and shrill and piercing and lofty and Grand and high flown exalted elevated Rays height and high priced expens just flat out expensive like a $20 hamburger expensive who would have ever thought the day would come you'd pay $20 for a hammer I went to Iceland and paid 50 years ago dear costly strong heavy it's it's War for every Hungry Heart in closing maybe for every Hungry Heart That desires to hear the word there's a devil that desires to keep God's bride from hearing the word that they need to hear for this hour you know I long to be out of the ABCs I I long to be out of the stage I want to be out of this stage but the reality is with the kind of week that a lot of people had to try to break down a mystery I am preaching a mystery but to try to break down a mystery in an atmosphere like we're living walking through right now wouldn't wouldn't probably go very far just look at a couple Sundays ago it just don't go very far in an hour like this we've got to be we've got to we've got to speak where where people are and we've got to minister to where they are and some of you had mind battles all week long fought discouragement fought depression fought first one thing and then another all week long the last thing you need today is for me to give you a summary of The Seven Seals what we need today is a reminder one more time we need a reminder it's not optional you don't get to take a week off this is a daily thing you got to find a way to let your praise out every day you got to get it out there every day and not just any old praise will do fierce I like this one loaded when I used to get out of the vehicle I used to get out of the vehicle preaching up in North Carolina again get my Bible out under my arm and walk toward the door there was an old brother that used to stand on the on the porch of brother uh Green's church and he'd say well where comes brother Shelly and he looks like he's loaded for bar I was I was loaded I didn't have to wait till I got there to figure out what I was going to say I already had my message ready it was going to depend on the Lord to help me deliver it our praise ought to be loaded amen you don't come in in here and shoot an empty gun when you're praising him it's got to be loaded it's got to be full and ready it's got to really be the Overflow of what you fought now now let me get down to the last three tipsy let the Tipsy praise be in their mouth what does it mean well are these men drunk isn't that what he said are these men drunk look at all these galileans acts chapter 2 look at all these galileans just like the Rednecks this early in the day drunk already drinking already inebriated this early in the day what do you think they were doing that caused people to to uh accuse them of being drunk when they weren't drunk they were drunk on the new wine but they had not been drinking the natural sauce they've been drinking spiritual sauce you get a good dose of spiritual sauce and you'll quit running to the natural stuff nothing will satisfy you like a good Holy Ghost drink hallelujah praise as an overflow of your Tipsy experience inebriated stammering stuttering jumping twisting in a Godly manner amen you're not on the Dance Floor you're on the red [Music] Seashore you sisters when you're praising the Lord remember don't don't let it be something that to get on your nerves but and hinder you but remember remember even your praise has to be a modest praise in the sense that you don't want to you know undress yourself I'm not for that but I I'd like to see somebody lose their pride on I went to the Tent Revival they picked me up I was had a night off of Revival and my friends wanted me to go to the Tent Revival with them in ela Alabama and I was preaching the next night in Dothan and I needed a night off I just closed a 3-we Revival and was getting ready to go into another Revival literally one night later and I wanted to stay home by myself but my friends wanted me to go to this Tent Revival that they were having in ela and when they picked me up I was dressed better than any of them I would have left to have just gone in a pair of jeans because I was just tired I just didn't want to go and I certainly didn't want to dress but I knew in those days especially that I had better shill High flown EX exalted praise aana gets it but I was dressed threepiece suit and Tai and everybody in the car looked a lot more casual and they said what' you wear that for I said well I thought I thought I had better dress up I figured everybody would dress up I know how sometimes these Holiness people these were free holding his people and I knew how judgmental they were about how people dress for church so I thought I was doing the right thing said well you going to wish you hadn't wore that I said well I know it's hot no no it ain't hot but said now when those people get to praising the Lord the dust is going to fly it's going to look like a cloud in there but it won't be the glory Cloud it'll be a dust cloud and and those women said they're going to shout their hair down and hair pins are going to fly and hair pieces and rats and all those things women used to put in their hair to make it taller you know the higher the hair the closer to God that kind of thought that and I said that ain't going to bother me and said there'll be rolling around and that they're just going to have a time and said you're going to wish you was dressed different and I said well anything I intend to do to praise the Lord I can do it the way I'm dressed and I wasn't real nice about it I was kind of rough and I thought you know it's it's one thing when you go in the spirit of God gets to move in and you get in in in involved in the praise but these people plan it I was a little offended they know when they get there what they're going to do well I was of the school that you never know what the spirit of the Lord's going to do but they were of the school we do know cuz we're going to grab a hold of him and not let him loose till He blesses us that was their attitude I wasn't used to that so they called on me to sing I'd never been around this particular bunch of people before I I almost thought I sung but it slipped me I got to I thought I better sing a slow song If I sing a fast song they'll go berserk and they'll expect me to and I'm too tired to so I sung about a medium Tempo song but there weren medium Tempo musicians and by verse three I could hardly catch a breath and I was a young man they done speeded it up spit it up so fast I could hardly get to words in I looked up and here come four five right for me right toward me Brothers I thought are they going to take me off the platform what in the word are they going to do no they come up there and started hitting me on the leg while I was singing sing it brother sing it brother and I thought to myself that's what I'm trying to do I know you can't imagine me being the dignified one but I thought this is wildness the these people are wild come on I've only ever seen one other Bunch like it and they happen to be in the message they were so happy and so I thoughtwell I'm going to have to stop the m i could tell the musicians were never going to stop the song it was up to me so I said and finally we landed it and I smiled and put went to put the microphone down and they said sing another and I said well I want to give the time to the preacher and I'm just a guest here and I don't I don't want to take up any time saying brother so I sung again another song and here are some more come up Pat me on the shoulder Pat me on the leg screaming in my ear sing it brother sing it they got to dancing and running and praising the Lord and the longer they praised him the more I wanted to come on it's contagious in a few minutes the exhaustion started lifting that little bit of pride of you know thinking that I had a little more dignity than they did that started leaving I'd like to see some of you get in that I started snorting a little like they did you know and before I knew what had happened this is the truth the truth if I've ever told the truth before I knew what had happened I had lost the mic I know I never really knew what happened to the mic I think I think I must have thrown it but I don't know where I threw it I hope it wasn't expensive and did I ever have myself a time I mean to tell you I had a time and when I came to myself I was laying in the sawdust and I looked down across the front and there was a a a a a place about 3 in wide and about 20 ft long and the sawdust had been immaculately it looked like somebody had done it with a spoon and had immaculately pull that sawdust and it looked like a little trough like a rain trough or something all the way across I was so drunk I was laughing and and I I was so drunk I hardly knew where I was and I kept looking at that and I thought I know that wasn't there when I went up to saying what in the world is that and the big speaker the the real main guy he walked over there and put his hand down he helped me up and I said brother what happened he said brother Shelly God knock the starch out of you that's what he said he said God got nothing except God knocked the starch out of you and I said can you tell me what that he said oh brother Shelly I don't want to tell you what no videos thank you Jesus I don't want to tell you what happened I said tell me he said after you had danced and jumped and throw the mic and carried on like that he said you ended up on your face in the sawdust and he said I'm watching you there and I'm thinking pour it on him Lord pour it on him Lord knock the starch out of him Lord help him Jesus and he said I thought you'd lay there the rest of the service he said the next thing I know you was up on all fours you took your head and you dipped your nose right down in the sawdust and he said brother Shelly that trough across there is what you did with your nose you rooted across the the front like a pig I know what I know what High Praise Is I know what it means to get lost wasn't that wasn't that out of order yes I'm not going to stand here and tell you that wasn't out of order it was out of order and it was exactly what I needed because I had way too much order I didn't start out that way Hallelujah I picked it up I developed it I didn't start off with that but I picked it up and you know what we went in then the next night I had to go back and start the Revival and I can assure you that I never ran another Revival like the one I had the week before that happened it changed everything God literally had to knock the starch out of me and remind me you serve me you you serve me you're at my disposal somebody said I don't believe God would let do that to somebody he W he wouldn't do it to somebody that didn't want him to have control but see my heart wanted him to be in charge and yet I had taken over some of the responsibility of being in charge maybe some of you have taken over some of the responsibility of being in charge in your life and you just need to surrender it to him let's have the musicians becoming the embodiment of Praise let's stand together make me that Praise Jesus does it have to be wild no does it have to embarrass you no does it have to draw all the attention to you well it did me that night but nor normal circumstances no God was working on me he was getting me ready probably for what I do now come on he'll get you ready if you'll yield just be consistent my best piece of advice to you about praise is this don't you come in here one week and praise him like a wild woman and then come in here the next week like you lost your best friend that's not consistent praise and it won't give you the ultimate Victory you make up your mind when you come through those doors I have fought hell this week every devil in hell has tried to steal my joy my praise every Spirit has tried to talk me out of being at church and every joint in my body or every every system in my body screaming at me not to be here but I'm here anyway and I'm going to give God High Praise I'm going to let the High Praise of God be in my mouth in a two-edged sword that's right aren't you afraid we'll run some people off maybe we will won't there be some folks offended yes they will but we're not here to please people we're here to please him we're here to give him praise we're here to come into worship with him to become the very embodiment you ready H son you ready hun son I'm so thankful to have all of my children back home in church with me this morning I missed them while they were gone appreciate Benjamin being here but the rest of them are gone I'm glad they're [Music] back you give life you are love you bring life to the darkness you give
