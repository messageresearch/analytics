[58:15] story is not the same as anybody else's
[58:18] story your song may sound a little
[58:20] different than somebody else's song but
[58:23] you be who God has created you to be
[58:27] if you're loud don't be embarrassed that
[58:29] you're
[58:30] loud there's a lot of pipsqueak folks
[58:33] that you can't hear them when they talk
[58:35] even but if you're one of those well
[58:38] don't you be embarrassed if that's how
[58:40] God made you to be don't let it be some
[58:43] kind of intimidation or something that
[58:46] causes you to be that way but you
[58:48] worship God according to the dictates of
[58:51] your
[58:52] heart every church is Sovereign I'm so
[58:55] thankful that they don't have have to be
[58:56] cookie cutters of one another as long as
[58:59] the same gospel is being preached we can
[59:02] have Liberty to worship him tonight
[59:05] there's freedom for those who desire
[59:07] freedom I heard something that Hawk said
[59:10] I I think it was Hawk who was praying
[59:12] and and he said there's freedom in
[59:15] submission doesn't that sound like a
[59:18] paradox there's freedom in submission
[59:21] when we submit to the spirit of God
[59:23] we're free we're free when we surrender
[59:27] our rights and we claim his we are free
[59:32] I don't want to take much time for
[59:35] preliminaries because I came this
[59:37] evening with a word from the Lord and I
[59:39] want to do my best to deliver it to you
[59:41] although it does seem very strange to be
[59:44] in the service with sister Emily and not
[59:46] hear her sing will you be here in the
[59:49] morning perhaps all right bring a song
[59:51] Would you please bring a song in the
[59:54] morning we want to give thanks to God
[59:57] for the musicians that are here let's
[59:59] just be grateful so thankful for
[1:00:01] them their
[1:00:05] labor but I I didn't just come with a
[1:00:08] series or the fourth part of a series or
[1:00:11] the12th part of a Series tonight you
[1:00:14] know I can have I'm not quite I I'm not
[1:00:18] quite like brother Donnie he can take
[1:00:19] them a little bit longer than I can you
[1:00:22] know
[1:00:24] um Edition or so 256
[1:00:28] of but uh I didn't come with that this
[1:00:32] evening I came with something that I
[1:00:34] know that I know that I know that I know
[1:00:38] is from the Lord and it's for
[1:00:41] you who is it for it's for you well how
[1:00:44] do you know it's for me because you're
[1:00:46] here and God knew who was going to be
[1:00:49] here I didn't know I got a surprise
[1:00:51] tonight I didn't know who was going to
[1:00:52] be here but God knew who would be in the
[1:00:55] house
[1:00:56] I want you to turn with me before you're
[1:00:59] seated to John chap
[1:01:02] 15 this has been an unusual week for
[1:01:06] many of us and um I I felt pretty good
[1:01:11] all day Monday and then at
[1:01:15] bedtime uh something hit and it was not
[1:01:18] pleasant and it kept me through the
[1:01:21] night up and awake and alert and uh left
[1:01:24] me extremely week I mean oddly so for a
[1:01:29] couple of days but I had to be in the we
[1:01:32] didn't have a meeting Tuesday night we
[1:01:34] thought well if this is something going
[1:01:35] around we don't want it to
[1:01:38] spread and so we didn't have a service
[1:01:40] here Tuesday night not trying to be
[1:01:42] unspiritual but we just thought it might
[1:01:44] be the right thing to do and a few other
[1:01:47] people did catch catch some variation or
[1:01:50] version of it and um it just felt like
[1:01:56] I I I don't want to overs spiritualize
[1:01:59] everything some things are just we just
[1:02:02] caught a
[1:02:03] virus sometimes it's just we just didn't
[1:02:07] take care of our immune
[1:02:08] system sometimes it's we had too much
[1:02:13] sugar but there are times that we can
[1:02:17] sense you and I both that there's
[1:02:19] something a little more Sinister
[1:02:22] involved and I sense that the enemy was
[1:02:26] just flat out
[1:02:29] agitated and when you know that the
[1:02:31] enemy is agitated you have a decision to
[1:02:33] make do you back off so he'll calm down
[1:02:37] or do you press through and I was taught
[1:02:41] by some prayer warriors when I was a
[1:02:43] child you don't back off when there's
[1:02:46] opposition when the enemy has come to
[1:02:49] distract you press against him and God
[1:02:52] will give you the
[1:02:54] victory several begin to say well maybe
[1:02:56] we should postpone maybe we shouldn't
[1:02:58] have the I didn't know who was coming we
[1:03:00] hadn't had a lot of uh communication
[1:03:03] that there would be very many people
[1:03:05] here but I spent most of the the night
[1:03:08] Friday night praying that God's perfect
[1:03:11] will would be done and I knew when I
[1:03:13] woke up that morning that it was his
[1:03:16] will I think it was Maybe Might Have
[1:03:18] Been Thursday night I'm pretty sure it
[1:03:20] was Thursday night and when I woke up I
[1:03:23] knew that it was his will for us to be
[1:03:25] here and that was going to have
[1:03:26] something for us but it wasn't until
[1:03:28] last evening that I began to experience
[1:03:31] in the night something uh
[1:03:34] otherworldly that let me know that
[1:03:37] there's a key for us some years ago I
[1:03:41] preached a series I don't remember how
[1:03:43] many there were sister Alfreda could
[1:03:45] remember 16 or 13 or 18 how many how
[1:03:50] many survival strategies were there do
[1:03:52] you
[1:03:53] remember how many 50 15 survival
[1:03:56] strategies for the end time well I can't
[1:04:00] I know you're just cringing because
[1:04:01] you're afraid I'm going to preach all 15
[1:04:03] of them
[1:04:04] tonight uh 19 I think we did add some to
[1:04:08] the end brother Shaw I think you're
[1:04:09] right I want to give you one tonight
[1:04:12] it's the only one you
[1:04:13] need there's only one I only have one
[1:04:17] survival strategy for the end time and I
[1:04:20] want you to keep in mind that you're not
[1:04:21] to be survivors you are called to be
[1:04:24] Overcomers
[1:04:26] amen there's going to be a church in
[1:04:29] this hour that will scarcely be saved
[1:04:32] that will barely get through but there's
[1:04:35] a company of
[1:04:37] Overcomers sons of God and those who are
[1:04:40] a part of the bridal Paradigm who are
[1:04:43] not going to go out of here as as just
[1:04:45] survivors but they're going to go out of
[1:04:47] here having overcome the spirit of their
[1:04:52] age and I am glad to report to you
[1:04:54] tonight I'm one of them I'm not going
[1:04:58] out of here defeated by the spirit of
[1:05:01] This leod Dean age and to to the church
[1:05:05] write these things and to him that
[1:05:07] overcometh write these things so tonight
[1:05:11] I want to give you a word to him who
[1:05:14] overcometh to those who will not be
[1:05:17] satisfied with church anity but who
[1:05:21] desire a true
[1:05:23] experience with the Lord yes and if
[1:05:26] you're ready are you ready John chapter
[1:05:30] 15 I'll let you all control the volume
[1:05:33] seems a little loud but I'll let you all
[1:05:35] take care of that I do want to be
[1:05:38] heard John chapter 15 beginning in verse
[1:05:41] one Jesus all red letters I am the True
[1:05:47] Vine and my father is the
[1:05:52] husbandman he's the one who takes care
[1:05:55] of The Vineyard every branch in me that
[1:06:00] beareth not fruit he taketh away and
[1:06:04] every branch that beareth fruit he
[1:06:08] purgeth it he prunes it that it
[1:06:13] may now now listen at the difference I
[1:06:16] know we're reading the scripture but I
[1:06:18] want you to capture the difference
[1:06:20] already you see because the same
[1:06:24] tool that separates the unfruitful
[1:06:28] Branch from the vine same tool is the
[1:06:32] same tool that prunes that purges a
[1:06:37] barely
[1:06:39] producing Vine so that it might be able
[1:06:43] to bring
[1:06:44] forth more fruit same pruning
[1:06:47] shears the same pruning shears that we
[1:06:51] use to cut off the dead wood yes we use
[1:06:55] to prune back so that the shrub can
[1:06:58] spread or so that the uh fruit or
[1:07:02] vegetable can flourish the Tomato for
[1:07:06] instance you're pulling off the suckers
[1:07:09] and you are it's hard to do it because
[1:07:12] the plant's already In Bloom and it's
[1:07:14] hard to cut off those blooms and see
[1:07:17] those Tomatoes wasted but you understand
[1:07:20] that if you don't bring strength to the
[1:07:22] bottom of the plant then by the time the
[1:07:25] plant begins to grow there'll be nothing
[1:07:27] to support it so it's better to cut it
[1:07:30] off and let it begin to Bush out and get
[1:07:33] strength at the bottom the same tool
[1:07:36] that's used to separate the unfruitful
[1:07:39] branch is used to prune the branch that
[1:07:43] is bearing but not bearing as much as it
[1:07:47] can he said now ye are clean through the
[1:07:52] word which I have spoken
[1:07:56] unto you the word of God is a cleansing
[1:07:59] to us we are Washed by the Water of the
[1:08:03] word can you say Amen but now we're
[1:08:06] getting to the strategy to overcome in
[1:08:09] the end time it's so simple we will miss
[1:08:12] it if we don't look at it carefully
[1:08:16] abide in
[1:08:18] me Jesus abide in me and I in you as the
[1:08:26] branch cannot bear fruit of
[1:08:31] itself except it abide I'm reading it
[1:08:36] like a like a kindergarten
[1:08:38] teacher I'm not insinuating that I have
[1:08:41] to go that slow for you but I'm doing it
[1:08:44] because I want you to catch these
[1:08:46] familiar words tonight in a deeper
[1:08:50] Dimension that except it abide in the
[1:08:54] vine that's the only way the branch let
[1:08:57] me read it from the top abide in me and
[1:08:59] I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit
[1:09:02] of itself except it abide in the vine no
[1:09:07] more can ye except
[1:09:11] ye abide in me we're going all the way
[1:09:14] to verse six I am the vine Jesus is
[1:09:18] telling us I am the vine you're not the
[1:09:22] vine I'm the vine Jesus said you are the
[1:09:26] branches he that abideth in me Jesus and
[1:09:30] I in him the same bringeth
[1:09:35] forth if there's no fruit there's no
[1:09:39] abiding that's what he's telling us I am
[1:09:43] the vine ye are the branches he that
[1:09:45] abideth in me and I in him the same
[1:09:49] bringeth forth much fruit for without
[1:09:52] me you can do
[1:09:57] let's say that without
[1:09:59] him I can do nothing do you believe that
[1:10:05] we get kind of arrogant sometime a
[1:10:08] little
[1:10:09] overconfident like we can do something
[1:10:11] you can't do anything I can't do
[1:10:14] anything without him let's not be seated
[1:10:17] until we read verse seven if if if if
[1:10:22] small word just a small little article
[1:10:25] here but pretty important in the context
[1:10:28] of this verse if a man abide not in
[1:10:34] me uh verse did I not read verse six I
[1:10:38] didn't excuse me sorry if a man abide
[1:10:40] not in me he is cast forth as a branch
[1:10:44] and is withered and Men gather them and
[1:10:47] cast them into the fire that doesn't
[1:10:49] sound good and they are burned now
[1:10:53] here's here is what we've got to know
[1:10:54] tonight if ye if if ye abide in
[1:11:00] me
[1:11:01] and my words abide in
[1:11:06] you you've got a blank
[1:11:11] check ye shall ask what you
[1:11:15] will and it shall be done unto you does
[1:11:19] anybody believe that word if you abide
[1:11:22] in me and my words abide in you
[1:11:25] ye shall ask what you will and it shall
[1:11:28] be done unto you Papa we come to you
[1:11:33] tonight
[1:11:34] Desiring that every thought that you
[1:11:38] would have us to know tonight we can
[1:11:41] know it's our desire to hear whatever
[1:11:45] you would say to us in order for that to
[1:11:48] happen I've got to get out of the way
[1:11:51] and I need your help to do that tonight
[1:11:55] there's been quite a bit of prayer going
[1:11:57] up for this service we are gathered now
[1:12:00] in faith believing that you have
[1:12:04] something whether it feels
[1:12:06] simple it it it could be very simple but
[1:12:11] lord it's something that will help us to
[1:12:15] move forward in this hour of great
[1:12:19] opposition that opposer is no doubt
[1:12:22] among us our adversary is always
[1:12:26] faithful to be in church but we believe
[1:12:30] that greater is he that is in us than he
[1:12:33] that is in the world may we push back
[1:12:36] the darkness in the authority of Jesus
[1:12:38] Christ may we put our eyes on him and
[1:12:42] receive Lord from your hand we'll give
[1:12:45] you glory and honor and praise for it's
[1:12:47] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:12:50] pray and the Saints saided amen you may
[1:12:53] be seated this evening but I pray that
[1:12:56] you'll have your attention directed
[1:12:58] toward the word if I were to take a
[1:13:02] subject for this evening or give it some
[1:13:04] sort of a title I would call it
[1:13:07] disconnection the life has been severed
[1:13:11] disconnection the life has been severed
[1:13:16] how many of you are familiar with the
[1:13:19] terminology feeling
[1:13:21] disconnected sir anybody ever felt disc
[1:13:25] disconnected let me give you a
[1:13:27] definition you probably don't need one
[1:13:28] but here's one anyhow feeling
[1:13:31] disconnected means
[1:13:33] experiencing a a sense of
[1:13:36] Detachment or separation from your
[1:13:39] surroundings people or even yourself
[1:13:42] often leading to feelings of isolation
[1:13:46] loneliness or a lack of connection to
[1:13:49] anything meaningful in your life anybody
[1:13:52] ever experience it can feel like you are
[1:13:56] observing your life from outside
[1:14:01] yourself not fully engaged in the
[1:14:07] moment but I'm not just talking about
[1:14:10] being emotionally
[1:14:12] disconnected I want to emphasize what it
[1:14:16] means when we are spiritually
[1:14:20] disconnected and so this is the
[1:14:22] definition of being spiritually
[1:14:26] disconnected it means experiencing a
[1:14:29] sense of separation from a higher power
[1:14:33] from your inner self or a feeling of
[1:14:36] lacking meaning or purpose in life often
[1:14:40] accompanied by a lack of connection to
[1:14:43] something larger than yourself for some
[1:14:47] its nature or Community for others it's
[1:14:51] almighty God and His word it is aom
[1:14:55] companied by a feeling of emptiness or
[1:14:58] disorientation in your spiritual
[1:15:01] practices beliefs or in your
[1:15:06] disciplines if I were to pull this
[1:15:10] congregation tonight I would say that
[1:15:12] most every one of us have experienced
[1:15:15] the EB and the flow of feeling connected
[1:15:19] and not feeling connected there are
[1:15:21] times when it feels like the Lord is so
[1:15:25] so close that you can almost feel him
[1:15:27] breathing down your neck and then there
[1:15:30] are other times that it seems like God
[1:15:32] is a million miles away from you notice
[1:15:37] I said seems like because he's not in
[1:15:40] the move business of moving to and fro I
[1:15:44] need to remind you that if God feels
[1:15:47] like he's 10,000 miles away somebody
[1:15:53] moved and I want you to know for sure it
[1:15:56] wasn't him because he said I'll never
[1:15:59] leave you I'll never forsake you I'll go
[1:16:04] with you even to the end of the world I
[1:16:06] believe that promise tonight I believe
[1:16:09] that even as brother gy said tonight
[1:16:11] even when I don't feel him he's working
[1:16:14] even when I don't see him he's still
[1:16:18] working and so if there has been a
[1:16:22] disconnection if somebody has hung up
[1:16:24] the receiver if somebody has cut the
[1:16:28] line I want to ask you tonight who has
[1:16:32] cut us off when we feel spiritually
[1:16:35] disconnected is it ever because God has
[1:16:39] dropped the
[1:16:42] line are you sure you believe that yes
[1:16:45] it's never because God has dropped the
[1:16:48] line even when you don't feel him he's
[1:16:51] there even when you don't feel the
[1:16:53] connection he's there
[1:16:55] even when you don't sense the connection
[1:16:57] he's still there so if somebody hung up
[1:17:00] the phone who was it that hung up the
[1:17:02] phone I'm not here to condemn you
[1:17:04] tonight I'm here to let you know that
[1:17:07] God's not playing with you like you
[1:17:08] think he is
[1:17:11] sometime he's not the problem here he
[1:17:15] maintains a connection he's as close as
[1:17:18] the mention of his name all you have to
[1:17:20] do is breathe Jesus all you have to do
[1:17:23] is Think Jesus you don't even have to
[1:17:25] speak Jesus just think him in your mind
[1:17:28] just bring him into your heart just
[1:17:30] bring him into the Forefront of your
[1:17:32] thoughts and you'll know that he's there
[1:17:36] my old granny told me many years ago she
[1:17:38] said you ever feel like Jesus doesn't
[1:17:41] love you she said you go in the room now
[1:17:43] this is kind of silly advice but granny
[1:17:46] knew what she was talking about so she
[1:17:48] said if you ever feel like that he
[1:17:49] doesn't love you you go in a room shut
[1:17:51] the door look in the mirror and start
[1:17:53] telling the Lord I said well I won't be
[1:17:55] seeing the Lord she said I know that's
[1:17:57] the
[1:17:59] problem she said but you look in that
[1:18:01] mirror and you began to tell him Lord
[1:18:04] Jesus I love
[1:18:07] you Lord Jesus I love
[1:18:10] you Lord Jesus I love you I said you
[1:18:15] mean Big Mama I've got to say that over
[1:18:17] and over again she said say it until you
[1:18:21] really mean it until your heart is
[1:18:24] really connected Ed with your
[1:18:26] words and she said I guarantee you you
[1:18:28] may not hear him say
[1:18:31] anything but before you finish you ought
[1:18:34] to keep saying it meaning it I love you
[1:18:37] Jesus until you begin to sense something
[1:18:40] changing in you and if you're real
[1:18:44] careful she said you'll begin to hear
[1:18:46] him maybe not with an ear but in your
[1:18:49] spirit you'll begin to hear him
[1:18:51] Whispering back to you and I love you
[1:18:54] too
[1:18:55] and I love you too if he never tells you
[1:18:58] in an autal voice it's still the truth
[1:19:01] he loves you he's given everything for
[1:19:04] us come
[1:19:06] on and it's a miserable place to be when
[1:19:10] you pray and you can't feel the tug on
[1:19:13] the other end of the line right so what
[1:19:16] do we do in a moment like that do we
[1:19:18] give up do we pull back do do we stay
[1:19:20] home do we do we give up our spiritual
[1:19:23] discipline do we quit qu reading the
[1:19:25] Bible do we quit praying cuz we didn't
[1:19:27] feel it one time when we prayed well you
[1:19:30] can if you want to that's exactly what
[1:19:32] your adversary would have you to do he
[1:19:35] wants you to slack up and give up he
[1:19:39] wants you to look back but I'm here to
[1:19:42] tell you tonight you'll never overcome
[1:19:45] looking
[1:19:46] back the only way you'll ever overcome
[1:19:49] is to look straight ahead into the eyes
[1:19:52] that bled and died for you find him in
[1:19:55] his word find him at Calvary find him on
[1:19:58] the
[1:19:59] cross and know that the price is paid
[1:20:04] and justification means exactly what we
[1:20:06] know it means Redemption means exactly
[1:20:08] what we know it means just as if I'd
[1:20:11] never you never did it brother brandom
[1:20:13] said well you just never did it in the
[1:20:15] first place it's not even there it's not
[1:20:19] being held to your account because the
[1:20:22] blood the grace of God and the blood of
[1:20:25] Jesus has set you free somebody in this
[1:20:28] room tonight is dealing with a spiritual
[1:20:32] disconnection and our first reaction is
[1:20:35] to blame
[1:20:36] somebody it's just human nature you know
[1:20:40] the devil's really been fighting me and
[1:20:42] I feel disconnected come on now my life
[1:20:45] has taken a turn for the worst and I
[1:20:48] really feel
[1:20:50] disconnected my wife has said some
[1:20:52] bitter words to me and it's caused me to
[1:20:55] feel really disconnect from
[1:20:58] him from
[1:21:00] him we we say well I've been a little
[1:21:03] overlooked in the church and I'm
[1:21:04] beginning to feel
[1:21:06] quite
[1:21:08] disconnected my job is pressuring me and
[1:21:11] the stress is building and and I'm just
[1:21:14] feeling
[1:21:16] so
[1:21:18] disconnected I know you're acting like I
[1:21:21] you I you know I'm just making something
[1:21:23] up here
[1:21:26] I would dare say I'm not a betting man
[1:21:30] but I would dare say somebody in this
[1:21:32] room in the last seven days five days
[1:21:34] has said that thought that or said that
[1:21:37] I just feel
[1:21:41] so if you think that my tone or my
[1:21:45] attitude is to belittle you it it is in
[1:21:48] no way it is in no way designed to do
[1:21:51] that because I've been exactly where you
[1:21:53] are
[1:21:55] I know exactly what that feels like that
[1:21:58] you need him and he's
[1:22:02] silent I know exactly what it feels like
[1:22:05] when you go looking for him and you
[1:22:07] really can't find him not because he's
[1:22:11] not there but because you're not looking
[1:22:14] in the right
[1:22:15] places brother brandham talks about this
[1:22:18] God who who hides himself and reveals
[1:22:22] himself in simplicity and he said men
[1:22:25] will say where is God I don't see God I
[1:22:29] can't find God and he said they're
[1:22:31] stepping all over God because he's in
[1:22:33] every blade of grass he's in every
[1:22:36] Sunrise he's in every sunset he's in the
[1:22:39] mountain grandure come on he's in the
[1:22:42] rain he's in the storm he's in the flood
[1:22:45] he's in the
[1:22:47] drought he's in the flower he's in the
[1:22:50] tree come on you're looking for God he's
[1:22:53] hiding in simp it and guess what he will
[1:22:56] reveal himself to you in the same manner
[1:23:00] in
[1:23:03] Simplicity Church complicates it
[1:23:06] religion complicates it but faith will
[1:23:09] simplify
[1:23:10] it if you are disconnected if you are
[1:23:14] feeling disconnected tonight it is not
[1:23:17] because God has failed you it is not
[1:23:20] because God doesn't hear you it's not
[1:23:23] because God has let you down somebody
[1:23:26] has turned
[1:23:28] loose and God has not turned
[1:23:34] loose there's only two of us in this
[1:23:37] tug if God's still holding the
[1:23:40] Rope that's right you you you don't have
[1:23:43] to backslide to let go of the
[1:23:46] Rope you you don't have to stop going to
[1:23:49] church to let go on the Rope it's says
[1:23:51] if you quit letting him have preeminence
[1:23:53] in your thought thoughts if you stop
[1:23:56] letting him have preeminence in your
[1:23:59] decisions if you fail to worship I want
[1:24:02] you to know whether you like it or not
[1:24:04] you were created to worship
[1:24:08] God you were created to worship it's as
[1:24:12] much a part of who you are as you're
[1:24:15] designed to hear the
[1:24:18] word the emphasis is on the word and so
[1:24:21] therefore we have put the emphasis on
[1:24:23] preaching
[1:24:25] the emphasis should be on the word we
[1:24:28] have placed the emphasis on preaching
[1:24:32] and we have forgotten the necessity the
[1:24:34] need the joy that comes when we connect
[1:24:38] with him Spirit to spirit with
[1:24:42] worship it's not just a touch you need
[1:24:45] somebody said oh she was really crying
[1:24:48] oh she was really WIP in the snot I want
[1:24:50] you to know that means absolutely
[1:24:53] nothing about when what we're talking
[1:24:55] about tonight you can cry or not cry you
[1:25:00] can snot or not snot that's not what I'm
[1:25:03] talking about I'm not talking about a
[1:25:05] feeling or a goosebump or a sensation or
[1:25:08] the hair standing up on your on your arm
[1:25:12] what I'm talking about is a
[1:25:14] knowing I'm talking about faith by
[1:25:17] Revelation I know that I know that I
[1:25:19] know that even when I don't feel
[1:25:21] connected I am amen and if I have if I'm
[1:25:25] am not connected the only only possible
[1:25:29] reason is I have failed to
[1:25:33] [Music]
[1:25:36] abide it's abiding in
[1:25:38] him I had this experience and you know
[1:25:42] I'm not going to make a big production
[1:25:44] over it because there are so many
[1:25:47] critics there's so many people out there
[1:25:50] especially around the message who
[1:25:52] believe that you know uh Visions are
[1:25:55] over and dreams are over and you know
[1:25:59] and and only only the prophet could see
[1:26:03] no one else can see no one else can
[1:26:05] discern no one else can feel I'm so glad
[1:26:08] I know that he's Jesus Christ the same
[1:26:11] yesterday today and forever I'm so glad
[1:26:14] I know that there are still Sears in the
[1:26:17] bride of Christ who God deals with by
[1:26:20] seeing others he deals with by hearing
[1:26:25] come on but some he deals with by
[1:26:28] seeing and it's always been my way of
[1:26:31] communication with the Lord he would let
[1:26:34] me see something a dream a picture an
[1:26:36] image a
[1:26:37] vision some kind of something I don't
[1:26:40] want to spend time emphasizing it at all
[1:26:44] but in the night last night I had one of
[1:26:46] those things let's just call it that not
[1:26:48] put too much on it except that it was
[1:26:51] God letting me know there's a key for
[1:26:53] you in this
[1:26:55] I was standing on the bow of a of a boat
[1:26:59] uh I wouldn't call it a yacht but it was
[1:27:02] certainly more than I could
[1:27:04] afford I I could afford a dinghy or
[1:27:07] something like that a a a a blowup boat
[1:27:10] maybe but but it it wasn't it wasn't a
[1:27:13] steamliner you know it wasn't a it
[1:27:15] wasn't a like a like a river cruise boat
[1:27:18] or something like that but it was it it
[1:27:20] was a nice boat and I was standing on
[1:27:22] the on the bow of the boat and there
[1:27:24] were quite a few people around in fact I
[1:27:27] recognized some of you some of our own
[1:27:29] church people were there and there arose
[1:27:32] a
[1:27:33] storm it was a motor powerered boat not
[1:27:36] a not one powered with ores and there
[1:27:39] was a storm that that Rose and several
[1:27:43] were were tossed back and forth and
[1:27:46] everybody was looking for something to
[1:27:48] hold on to a uh you know some kind of
[1:27:52] something that was stable
[1:27:55] and and some were stumbling around and
[1:27:57] some were falling and some were holding
[1:28:00] on and and pulling others up that had
[1:28:03] stumbled and and fallen and it was just
[1:28:06] just went on and on sometimes these
[1:28:08] things can go on for quite a while and
[1:28:10] all of a sudden big waves began to come
[1:28:13] crashing over the the front of this big
[1:28:16] boat and it was literally taking people
[1:28:21] with it it was knocking people right in
[1:28:24] into the into the ocean right into the
[1:28:27] sea and I caught a glimpse of people Bob
[1:28:31] bobbling bobbing up and down like a cork
[1:28:35] in the water and and a fear struck my
[1:28:39] heart I here come another wave and and
[1:28:42] knock some other folks this way and I
[1:28:44] could see that some were doing pretty
[1:28:47] good uh treading water like a dog you
[1:28:50] know just really putting a lot of effort
[1:28:52] in it and I saw there some that were
[1:28:54] trying to to relax so they could kind of
[1:28:57] float and not struggle some some had had
[1:29:00] a strategy that if we if we just kind of
[1:29:03] relax is how do you relax when you're
[1:29:05] drowning you know but if I can relax a
[1:29:07] little I I I perhaps will last a little
[1:29:10] bit
[1:29:11] longer and I looked around to see if
[1:29:14] somebody was going to
[1:29:15] help ain't that strange and there was
[1:29:19] nobody
[1:29:20] there I don't know what happened to all
[1:29:23] the people that didn't look like they
[1:29:24] were all in the water but but uh there
[1:29:28] was nobody there to help and and I began
[1:29:31] to look for
[1:29:32] ropes I look for life jackets I look for
[1:29:37] what do you call the the
[1:29:39] round life preservers and all these
[1:29:43] different things and I found a few and I
[1:29:45] would toss them out the best I could but
[1:29:47] remember there's a storm and the boat is
[1:29:50] still it's still just dashing all around
[1:29:53] and I could look at people going under
[1:29:56] and coming to the top and sputtering and
[1:29:59] I start praying I catch myself and I
[1:30:02] began to call on the Lord and I said
[1:30:06] surely there's a Lifeline surely there's
[1:30:10] a Lifeline surely there's a Lifeline I
[1:30:12] kept saying it and I opened up this this
[1:30:16] deck box and and there was what looked
[1:30:19] like the strongest finest rope you'd
[1:30:22] ever seen in your life and I thought
[1:30:24] that is surely going to help us people
[1:30:26] were beginning to cry out and then I
[1:30:29] noticed there was some I didn't
[1:30:31] recognize that somehow we're in the
[1:30:33] water at the same time when I drug that
[1:30:37] heavy rope out of the deck
[1:30:40] box and began to try to figure how I
[1:30:42] would would unroll it and and get it
[1:30:45] into the water it changed in my hand and
[1:30:49] it became like a narrow Vine like a
[1:30:53] vining plant plant like a Twining
[1:30:56] plant and it it was such a
[1:30:59] disappointment to me in that moment
[1:31:01] because I thought I had this Mighty
[1:31:05] strong rope very capable rope and it
[1:31:09] seemed with that rope everyone could be
[1:31:12] spared but now it has changed into into
[1:31:17] some kind of little Vine that almost
[1:31:20] felt at times I'm moving it my hands
[1:31:22] over it it almost felt brittle like it
[1:31:26] would not stand up to the weight of one
[1:31:29] person tugging on it and and certainly
[1:31:32] more and and I Heard a Voice in all of
[1:31:36] this that said what are you going to do
[1:31:39] and I said well I'm going to work with
[1:31:41] what I have and I began to throw this
[1:31:45] out and as I threw it out into the water
[1:31:49] I saw people beginning to grab a hold of
[1:31:52] what looked like that skinny little
[1:31:55] Vine and I heard a
[1:31:57] voice that said it's John
[1:32:01] 15 they'll all be okay all right every
[1:32:05] one of them will be all right it's John
[1:32:10] 15 now I want you to know something I I
[1:32:13] don't I mean that was kind of even
[1:32:15] strange for me but I'm here to tell you
[1:32:19] tonight there is a Lifeline for you
[1:32:24] there are times that you may not see it
[1:32:26] or feel it there are times that if you
[1:32:28] saw it it might not look sufficient but
[1:32:31] but the answer for us is John 15 I am
[1:32:36] the
[1:32:37] vine you are the
[1:32:39] branches I'm not going to go into any
[1:32:42] more detail but there are some other
[1:32:44] interesting things that that happened in
[1:32:46] that experience but but I realize that
[1:32:50] the only safety the only escape the the
[1:32:53] only way out was if people would grab a
[1:32:57] hold of something that didn't even look
[1:33:00] like it had the strength to pull them
[1:33:04] out but it did because it was the vine
[1:33:09] it was the John 15 Vine it was the Jesus
[1:33:13] Vine I am the vine you are the branches
[1:33:16] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:33:20] you you can get out you can find rescue
[1:33:25] you can find Deliverance you can have
[1:33:28] your burden lifted you can come out from
[1:33:31] under the hurt and the wounds and the
[1:33:34] scars and the pain of what life has done
[1:33:39] and what religion has done and what
[1:33:41] churches have done and what preachers
[1:33:44] have done help me now you've got to get
[1:33:47] out from under the weight of all of that
[1:33:49] and take a hold of the vine even if it
[1:33:52] doesn't look like it'll be enough it'll
[1:33:55] be enough because it's the Living Vine
[1:34:00] it's the real Vine if you allow yourself
[1:34:04] to be disconnected in this late hour you
[1:34:06] are severing your
[1:34:09] life you're cutting yourself
[1:34:12] off from the very
[1:34:15] thing from the very thing that will give
[1:34:18] you overcoming strength and power help
[1:34:21] me now I'm not done help me I want you
[1:34:25] to hear this in the Amplified version of
[1:34:29] the Bible John 15:7 reads like this if
[1:34:32] you live in
[1:34:34] me abide
[1:34:37] vitally
[1:34:38] United to
[1:34:40] me we hear the prophet saying it's it's
[1:34:43] it's Unity time it's unifying time it's
[1:34:49] Union
[1:34:50] time it's time to be one
[1:34:54] it's time to be joined with him and I
[1:34:57] want you to know there's nothing that's
[1:35:00] nothing but the truth if you live in me
[1:35:03] abide vitally United to me Jesus said
[1:35:07] and my
[1:35:10] words
[1:35:14] remain they not only need to
[1:35:18] remain to abide to stay with you they
[1:35:22] need to be in the
[1:35:24] Forefront hello they need to have
[1:35:27] preeminence the word is the only thing
[1:35:30] I'm telling you God's word is the only
[1:35:33] thing that's going to be a Lifeline to
[1:35:35] us in the hour that we're living right
[1:35:38] now we're going to have to hold on to
[1:35:40] the word when it's comfortable we're
[1:35:42] going to have to hold on to the word
[1:35:44] when it's uncomfortable we're going to
[1:35:45] have look this
[1:35:46] way when it's uncomfortable we're going
[1:35:49] to have to hold on to the word when it
[1:35:51] feels good we're going to have to hold
[1:35:53] on to the word word when we don't feel
[1:35:54] anything we're going to have to hold on
[1:35:56] to the word because it's a John 15
[1:35:59] Lifeline if you abide in me if you live
[1:36:02] in me and my words remain in you and
[1:36:06] continue to live in your hearts folks
[1:36:09] we're the only ones that can fulfill
[1:36:12] that part of this verse it's up to us to
[1:36:15] make sure that his words remain
[1:36:18] preeminent in our life it's up to us to
[1:36:22] Care
[1:36:24] it's up to us to take the effort to keep
[1:36:27] the word ever before us he doesn't hang
[1:36:32] up true he doesn't
[1:36:34] disconnect if we are disconnected and
[1:36:37] sometimes we are it's because we turn
[1:36:39] loose of the vine well I know brother
[1:36:42] but I I don't know what to do about it
[1:36:44] it's more simple than what we would like
[1:36:46] to think tonight we think that if we
[1:36:49] feel it simple if we see it as simple
[1:36:54] uh then it somehow
[1:36:57] delegitimizes what we're going through
[1:36:59] or it shrinks the seriousness of our
[1:37:02] problem it seems like we feel that our
[1:37:05] problems are so complicated and so
[1:37:08] complex there will have to be a
[1:37:11] complicated and complex
[1:37:16] solution but the reality is our mind is
[1:37:21] making it bigger than it is
[1:37:25] it's more simple than what we realize
[1:37:28] the greatest battle ever fought is not
[1:37:30] as complicated as we have tried to make
[1:37:33] it it's actually rather simple if you
[1:37:37] will abide in Jesus Christ and make sure
[1:37:41] that his words abide and remain in you
[1:37:45] and continue to live and Thrive and have
[1:37:49] preeminence in your heart then ask
[1:37:52] whatever you will
[1:37:56] [Applause]
[1:37:59] yes it's not a blank check for
[1:38:02] everybody you understand that don't you
[1:38:05] in the complete Jewish Bible I like Dr
[1:38:08] Stern's way of looking at this verse he
[1:38:10] said if you remain United with me and my
[1:38:16] words with you my words United with you
[1:38:21] then ask whatever you want
[1:38:24] and it
[1:38:26] will happen for you are you here Jesus
[1:38:31] didn't just say if you abide in me you
[1:38:33] shall ask what you will he also said if
[1:38:36] you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:38:41] you then you shall ask what you will and
[1:38:44] it shall be done unto you John 157 isn't
[1:38:48] talking about the word abiding in
[1:38:51] your in your head
[1:38:57] head I'm not a
[1:39:01] counselor how do you manage as a pastor
[1:39:03] and and not be a counselor well it's
[1:39:06] rough it's really rough I'm not a real
[1:39:09] counselor I don't always know how to
[1:39:13] help people navigate the situation that
[1:39:17] they're in I always have felt like I
[1:39:20] need more training I need some somebody
[1:39:23] to guide me help me know how to perhaps
[1:39:27] talk people through their problems
[1:39:30] there's such an emphasis on that these
[1:39:32] days in the church and I fall short and
[1:39:36] I confess to you that I fall short in
[1:39:39] that
[1:39:40] area when someone I've I've already told
[1:39:43] you that when when dear sister Terell
[1:39:47] nearly 90 years old at the time insisted
[1:39:51] on going to the zoo with our small
[1:39:54] school
[1:39:55] children I I didn't want her to go not
[1:39:59] because she couldn't get about but
[1:40:02] because I I thought it should be about
[1:40:05] them and not about her you know this was
[1:40:07] years ago I was in my 20s so it was a
[1:40:11] long time ago give me a little
[1:40:13] Grace and I said now be careful sister
[1:40:16] Terell and we're getting the stool and
[1:40:18] we're helping the kids are out and ready
[1:40:20] to see you know they're ready to see
[1:40:22] lions and T ERS and bears and we're
[1:40:25] still trying to gather sister Terrell's
[1:40:27] purse and things together to get her out
[1:40:29] she's dressed in school uniform and she
[1:40:32] is just ready to be part Sister Williams
[1:40:34] will remember I'm sure she will and she
[1:40:37] gets out and as she starts out uh I'm on
[1:40:42] one side and somebody reached for her on
[1:40:44] the other side and she didn't want their
[1:40:45] help she only wanted my help see that's
[1:40:48] what the problem
[1:40:49] was and she jerked a little bit away
[1:40:52] from them and when she did her her uh
[1:40:55] shoe because oh she couldn't wear tennis
[1:40:57] shoes no no no she had you know like
[1:41:00] dress pumps on her something and that
[1:41:02] slick shoe hit that that last step and
[1:41:06] down she went before I could even catch
[1:41:12] her and I look down this kind of
[1:41:14] counselor I
[1:41:16] am I looked down and saw this look of
[1:41:18] excruciating pain on her face and the
[1:41:20] only thing I could think about was the
[1:41:22] disappointment of the
[1:41:25] students we're going to have to take her
[1:41:27] to the emergency room we'll be there all
[1:41:31] day there will be no elephants tigers
[1:41:34] and bears for any of these
[1:41:37] kids we're there to see Willie be the
[1:41:41] famous
[1:41:42] gorilla and so the only strategy that I
[1:41:46] could think of at the
[1:41:48] time I knew that if I went in with an
[1:41:52] extra amount of sympathy it would be
[1:41:57] bad I knew this precious sister and so I
[1:42:01] said a you're all right get up from
[1:42:04] there let's go
[1:42:06] on and before she knew it she had been
[1:42:09] hauled
[1:42:13] up we were halfway across a parking lot
[1:42:16] before she could
[1:42:20] resist and guess what she was all right
[1:42:23] yeah why was she all right she will to
[1:42:26] be I helped her will to
[1:42:29] be I helped her make up her mind I
[1:42:32] am you see a lot of people get offended
[1:42:36] when I try to counsel
[1:42:38] because sometimes I say stupid things
[1:42:41] like this they they describe this
[1:42:44] elaborate problem that they
[1:42:46] have and I have a tendency to say it's
[1:42:50] in your head
[1:42:56] nobody wants to hear that because you
[1:42:59] think that means they're making it up no
[1:43:01] no no they're not making it up let me
[1:43:04] tell you the real estate of your brain
[1:43:06] is a reality and it can be in your head
[1:43:09] and it can be real at the same time
[1:43:12] every problem that we have will hang us
[1:43:15] up if it just hangs in the
[1:43:18] head Jesus didn't say if my words abide
[1:43:22] in your
[1:43:23] head he's talking about a relationship
[1:43:27] with his words he's talking about Spirit
[1:43:30] to Spirit fellowship with his words he's
[1:43:34] talking about a trust I trust that your
[1:43:38] word is going to see me
[1:43:44] through it's real your pain is real your
[1:43:48] circumstances are real your problems are
[1:43:51] real but a lot of them
[1:43:56] reside between your two
[1:43:59] ears it's like the old sister in the
[1:44:02] church when I was a kid she'd stand up
[1:44:04] and she'd say you know I don't have a
[1:44:05] problem with anybody I love everybody
[1:44:08] the only person I have problems with the
[1:44:10] only one that hinders me in my life is
[1:44:12] the one who lives between my own two
[1:44:16] elbows how many of you understand that a
[1:44:19] lot of times it's not as dark as it
[1:44:21] looks it's not as bad as it
[1:44:24] feels God is on the
[1:44:26] throne God has never lost a
[1:44:30] battle God has never forgotten one of
[1:44:33] his children we're engraved in the palm
[1:44:37] of his hand he couldn't forget us if he
[1:44:40] wanted to we're inscribed
[1:44:44] there we're a part of him am I screaming
[1:44:47] too loud we're a part of him we share
[1:44:52] DNA with God that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:44:55] is you and I need the Holy Ghost we need
[1:45:00] the Holy
[1:45:02] Ghost somebody said don't you want to
[1:45:04] call it holy spirit sometimes I do
[1:45:07] sometimes I
[1:45:08] [Music]
[1:45:09] don't well they say well people can't
[1:45:12] relate to ghost well there's one ghost
[1:45:15] you need to relate to and that's the
[1:45:18] Holy
[1:45:20] Ghost that's the very life of Jesus
[1:45:25] Christ that's the very eternal spirit of
[1:45:28] the father now dwelling in the life of a
[1:45:32] Believer it's not the third person of a
[1:45:37] trinity it's all Mighty God fulfilling
[1:45:41] his desire he didn't just want to live
[1:45:43] above you as father or walk with you as
[1:45:48] Emmanuel he wanted to live inside of us
[1:45:53] and the only way he could do it is what
[1:45:54] he said I will not leave you comfortless
[1:45:57] I will come to
[1:46:01] you the extreme trinitarians like to use
[1:46:04] the verse I I I will not leave you
[1:46:07] comfort this you won't be alone I will
[1:46:09] send I'll pray and send another
[1:46:12] comforter that's good I like that he is
[1:46:15] that but I like where he said I will not
[1:46:19] leave I will I will come to to you I
[1:46:24] will come to you the same
[1:46:26] Spirit we we know we've heard that all
[1:46:30] that was in the
[1:46:31] father was poured into Jesus Christ
[1:46:34] Yeshua the son and all that was in
[1:46:39] Christ was emptied and poured out into
[1:46:42] his
[1:46:44] church on the day of
[1:46:46] Pentecost and we forget who this is
[1:46:50] living inside of us you may have a
[1:46:54] struggle with a man between your two
[1:46:55] elbows but I want you to know there's
[1:46:57] somebody else living in here that's come
[1:47:00] to solve every problem he's come to
[1:47:03] deliver you from every
[1:47:05] situation he's come to throw you a
[1:47:08] Lifeline amen a John 15 Lifeline if
[1:47:12] you'll abide in me if you'll take a hold
[1:47:14] of me I'll take a hold of you if you'll
[1:47:17] let my word remain in you I got
[1:47:23] are you
[1:47:25] here you're not talking about in your
[1:47:28] head it's something more than
[1:47:32] that it's in your spirit you see the
[1:47:36] real you is the inward man we're
[1:47:39] tripartate men we're made of three parts
[1:47:43] all one just like the godhead right
[1:47:47] three manifestations of the same God
[1:47:51] three but one you're you're three but
[1:47:53] one you're not three
[1:47:55] people you're not three people you're
[1:47:59] one
[1:47:59] person but you are Body Soul and Spirit
[1:48:03] you're Spirit soul and body depending on
[1:48:06] which direction you're moving in it's
[1:48:09] there it's for us it's important for us
[1:48:11] to know the real you as Inner Man the
[1:48:13] spirit man the word must abide not in
[1:48:16] your head it must abide in your spirit
[1:48:19] before it will produce results in your
[1:48:22] life life he said if you abide in me and
[1:48:24] my words abide in you to abide means to
[1:48:27] remain to stay not leaving look look
[1:48:30] Lord look I need you to know one thing G
[1:48:32] I'm not going
[1:48:36] anywhere I'm not going to be like Mary
[1:48:39] and
[1:48:40] Joseph I'm not going to leave you three
[1:48:42] days and not know you're
[1:48:44] [Music]

[1:48:48] enough that if you if something's going
[1:48:50] a Miss in my walk with you in my
[1:48:53] relationship with you it's not going to
[1:48:54] take me 3 days to
[1:48:57] realize oh I'm not going to miss
[1:48:59] fellowship with you every single day of
[1:49:01] my life I'm going to pour myself into
[1:49:04] the word I'm going to find the
[1:49:08] time if I have to buy a dumb phone I'm
[1:49:11] going to find the time come on you get
[1:49:15] rid of the cable you can find the
[1:49:19] time you cancel your subscription to
[1:49:22] Netflix you can find the
[1:49:25] time there's no reason why we don't have
[1:49:28] the time we can make the time we make
[1:49:31] the time for disc
[1:49:33] golf we make the time to work a 9
[1:49:39] to5 we make the time for coffee with

[1:49:49] I'm not here tonight to scold you I'm
[1:49:51] here to tell you there's a lifel
[1:49:53] don't you let the devil convince you
[1:49:55] that God has disconnected from
[1:49:57] you he's holding on to you with
[1:50:00] everything that he's
[1:50:02] got you may not be able to hold on to
[1:50:04] your faith but your faith can hold on to
[1:50:07] you there are times we get that way
[1:50:10] remember the congressman said brother
[1:50:12] Brandon you lost your wife you lost your
[1:50:13] baby how did you hold on to your
[1:50:15] religion I didn't hold on to my religion
[1:50:17] it held on to me he's not talking about
[1:50:20] religion he's talking about faith he not
[1:50:22] talking about church anity he's talking
[1:50:24] about a real experience with
[1:50:30] God I I I I've been talking to my family
[1:50:34] and it just seems to me like that we
[1:50:37] don't see as many people
[1:50:40] getting the same kind of connection with
[1:50:43] God that we used to
[1:50:48] see I want you to know when I was born
[1:50:51] again at the age of seven

[1:56:26] popularity and so just because one out
[1:56:29] of 50 is a himym or one out of 50 is a
[1:56:32] inspirational message doesn't mean you
[1:56:35] need to be a Bonafide
[1:56:37] fan you can abide in the John 15 Vine
[1:56:41] you can't abide in Jesus and his word
[1:56:44] abide in you if you keep crowding out
[1:56:46] his words
[1:56:55] brother truth it is the truth it is the
[1:56:59] truth if you abide in me you've got to
[1:57:01] stay connected it pertains to our
[1:57:03] relationship and fellowship with him I
[1:57:06] know I know what they say just John 316

[1:57:14] let me tell you something we're not
[1:57:16] living in the Ephesian Church age we're
[1:57:19] not in the Philadelphian Church age
[1:57:21] we're at the ending of Leo deia the most
[1:57:24] wicked deceitful deceptive age the world
[1:57:27] has ever known I want you to know that
[1:57:30] it's very possible saints of God that
[1:57:32] what we all got by with last year we may
[1:57:35] not be able to get by with this year
[1:57:39] because we've got to overcome I've got
[1:57:41] to O I've got to overcome I've got to
[1:57:45] overcome somebody I've got to overcome
[1:57:50] [Applause]
[1:57:53] this word this message teaches that
[1:57:57] there is a total Deliverance
[1:58:01] [Music]
[1:58:02] available and church people are being
[1:58:05] woed into a stuper into a coma and being
[1:58:10] sold an
[1:58:12] idea that that's not attainable for
[1:58:16] you then the word is a lie then the
[1:58:19] message is
[1:58:21] deceitful because he said it is
[1:58:23] available and don't settle for anything
[1:58:27] [Music]
[1:58:28] less
[1:58:31] sir well if I only feed on pornography
[1:58:35] twice a
[1:58:37] year

[1:58:42] step out only step out on my wife every
[1:58:44] every three months everything I she
[1:58:46] ought not to mind everything ought ought
[1:58:48] to be all right folks I know it's
[1:58:50] getting a little tight I know
[1:58:52] everybody's not into this kind of
[1:58:54] preaching I'm actually holding back I'm
[1:58:57] actually showing a little kindness to
[1:58:59] the visitor I can cut it a whole lot
[1:59:01] straighter than this and have been doing
[1:59:04] it for a long time but it's more urgent
[1:59:06] to do it now it's more urgent to remind
[1:59:10] you somebody say well I'm I'm picking up
[1:59:13] I are you are you using foul language
[1:59:15] yeah well I pick it up because of of
[1:59:17] those around me every everybody around
[1:59:19] me uses it I want you to know it doesn't
[1:59:21] matter if everybody in your life
[1:59:23] everybody in your family everybody on
[1:59:25] your job everybody in your
[1:59:29] school doesn't matter if you're the only
[1:59:31] one in the whole odd
[1:59:33] world that doesn't do it you don't have
[1:59:35] to do it and if you do it it's because
[1:59:39] somebody has
[1:59:42] disconnected no wonder you feel like I
[1:59:45] can't feel I just feel like I can't feel
[1:59:53] no wonder we can't feel we've
[1:59:56] desensitized
[1:59:57] ourselves we've forgotten to run to the
[2:00:00] altar we forgotten to run to God we'
[2:00:03] forgotten to Bow our really bow our knee
[2:00:06] we get caught up in this cycle
[2:00:09] anyway we we we we do the religious
[2:00:14] talk Colossians 127 you see this this
[2:00:18] let me tell you something this
[2:00:19] fellowshipping I got to hurry this
[2:00:21] fellowshipping and relationship with
[2:00:23] Jesus this abiding in him and his words
[2:00:25] abiding in you it's a part of the great
[2:00:27] mystery of Colossians 1:27 to whom God
[2:00:31] would make known what is the riches of
[2:00:33] the glory of this mystery among the
[2:00:34] Gentiles which is Christ in you in you
[2:00:38] the hope of glory when he lives in you
[2:00:40] you don't have to feel
[2:00:42] him he's there when you've got a
[2:00:45] revelation that he lives there it's not
[2:00:47] about hearing him not about feeling him
[2:00:49] not about seeing him
[2:00:52] right it's about knowing that he's there
[2:00:54] it's about taking him at his word it's
[2:00:56] about trusting him the issue is a trust
[2:00:59] issue and I can understand that Mama
[2:01:02] failed you and Daddy failed you and
[2:01:04] preachers have failed you and bosses
[2:01:05] have failed you and buddies have failed
[2:01:07] you and friends have failed you and
[2:01:09] neighbors have failed you but I want you
[2:01:11] to know you're taking it out on the only
[2:01:13] one that has
[2:01:16] never never failed you and he never will
[2:01:21] that's right he never will he never will
[2:01:24] he never will he never will fa he never
[2:01:27] will let go of you he would never will
[2:01:30] forget who you are he sees right where
[2:01:34] you are he knows exactly how you feel
[2:01:38] right now it's legitimate and it's real
[2:01:41] I'm not here to tell you that what you
[2:01:43] feel is not real I'm here to tell you
[2:01:46] there's a way out of that kind of a
[2:01:49] slump there's a way out of that
[2:01:53] coma there's a way out of that
[2:01:58] numbness Christ is a mystery of God
[2:02:01] paragraph 394 we don't have time to talk
[2:02:04] about all three but here's the second
[2:02:05] part 394 he said next secondly the
[2:02:09] manifested Christ in you the hope of
[2:02:13] glory the manifested Christ in you the
[2:02:17] hope of
[2:02:19] glory you see when you realize that it's
[2:02:22] the manifested Christ in you then you
[2:02:25] realize it doesn't matter about who's
[2:02:27] holding on to who or who's Leto who yeah
[2:02:31] what matters is the reality of the
[2:02:36] Revelation you're forcing him to that
[2:02:41] filth you're carrying him around to
[2:02:43] those junk
[2:02:45] places it's Christ in you the hope of
[2:02:47] glory and if he's really there thriving
[2:02:49] and manifesting his life in you you're
[2:02:51] desires
[2:02:55] change we were looking for a particular
[2:02:57] quote before the service brother gy
[2:02:59] couldn't locate I couldn't locate it
[2:03:01] Joshua couldn't locate it but he but but
[2:03:03] Joshua did find
[2:03:06] one and I thought it was particularly
[2:03:10] powerful brother braham's praying for
[2:03:14] somebody I don't know if I'll ever be to
[2:03:17] see
[2:03:19] it or he's getting ready to pray
[2:03:22] PR he said the devil has put these
[2:03:25] afflictions on
[2:03:27] you that's my father I'm his son you're
[2:03:29] his sons and daughters that's our father
[2:03:32] the devil has put these afflictions on
[2:03:33] you deny
[2:03:36] it deny
[2:03:41] it no one's saying that the the
[2:03:44] headaches aren't real and no one's
[2:03:45] saying that the infirmity is not real
[2:03:46] and no one is saying the Affliction is
[2:03:48] not real we're just telling you you got
[2:03:50] to choose to deny it
[2:03:52] when you deny it you cut off its life he
[2:03:55] goes on to say he has no legal rights
[2:03:57] that's what we need to remember we need
[2:03:58] to remember we need to remember he has
[2:04:00] no legal
[2:04:03] rights he's operating without a
[2:04:06] license he has no legal rights to do
[2:04:08] that he's only doing that because our
[2:04:11] unbelief permits him to do it we have
[2:04:15] all things in Christ Jesus and now we
[2:04:17] own it he said right now we're Sons and
[2:04:19] Daughters of God and the seeds of
[2:04:21] Abraham with an unconditional Covenant
[2:04:23] with the power of the Holy Ghost with
[2:04:24] the resurrection of Jesus with signs
[2:04:26] wonders and miracles working in the
[2:04:28] church Hallelujah brother I'm telling
[2:04:29] you he's a liar he's afraid of the word
[2:04:32] of God he's afraid of the power of
[2:04:38] God I want you to understand that your
[2:04:41] enemy does not have the power to cut you
[2:04:44] off from John
[2:04:48] 15 he only has the power granted to him
[2:04:51] by God
[2:04:53] and that which we allow him to have
[2:04:56] right in our own life he's no more than
[2:04:59] a tool in the hand of God to bring this
[2:05:01] little overcoming bride to the
[2:05:03] Perfection that is going let me tell you
[2:05:05] something we fear what we shouldn't
[2:05:08] fear he has gained access because of
[2:05:11] unbelief if we can deal with the
[2:05:13] unbelief tonight I grew up in Pentecost
[2:05:16] where everything was sin some thought
[2:05:18] drinking coffee was sin but they would
[2:05:20] eat two pieces of chocolate cake
[2:05:24] instead I told you about the preacher
[2:05:27] who preached against Coca-Cola but he
[2:05:29] went home and drank a Double
[2:05:31] Cola some believed it was sin for a
[2:05:34] woman to come to church without a hat
[2:05:36] some believed it was sin for a woman to
[2:05:37] come to church with a hat that's
[2:05:40] right and we were constantly trying to
[2:05:43] jump through the hoops and please
[2:05:45] everybody and really we weren't pleasing
[2:05:48] anybody we were making ourselves
[2:05:50] absolutely miserable and ing the whole
[2:05:52] the whole revelation of God's grace to
[2:05:54] us so when I heard brother random say
[2:05:57] the first time there's only one sin I
[2:05:59] knew he had to be off the
[2:06:02] word my little Pentecostal mind
[2:06:05] said I know good well there's more than
[2:06:08] one he said oh no there's only one
[2:06:10] that's unbelief all these other things
[2:06:13] are the attributes of unbelief we do
[2:06:16] what we do and play with what we play
[2:06:17] listen to what we listen feed what we
[2:06:19] feed watch what we watch see what we see
[2:06:20] hear what we hear
[2:06:22] because we're we are we are absolutely
[2:06:24] showing forth the attributes of our
[2:06:26] unbelief he has no legal right without
[2:06:29] the presence of unbelief if we can get
[2:06:31] the unbelief cut out
[2:06:34] tonight thank you brother thank you
[2:06:37] brother he said the notice 394 the
[2:06:40] manifested Christ in you the hope of
[2:06:42] glory that great manifested God in
[2:06:43] Christ now Christ now Christ manifested
[2:06:55] but you've got to remain in him and his
[2:06:58] words remain in you that's why going to
[2:06:59] church is
[2:07:01] important that's why reading your Bible
[2:07:03] every day is important brother bam
[2:07:05] suggest you lead it read at least one
[2:07:07] chapter in your Bible every day I
[2:07:09] promise you that if you will hold
[2:07:11] yourself to that small
[2:07:13] discipline of reading one chapter today
[2:07:15] before you know it you'll be reading
[2:07:18] more
[2:07:20] yes I know how the first few days will
[2:07:24] go forgive me this is a song book I
[2:07:26] haven't got my scripture printed out but
[2:07:28] let me show you I know how the first few
[2:07:29] days
[2:07:31] [Music]
[2:07:36] ago got my chapter read
[2:07:40] who got her
[2:07:41] [Music]
[2:07:44] done you'll be putting your little ticks
[2:07:46] on that you know somewhere you get your
[2:07:48] sheet you'll get your spreadsheet some
[2:07:49] of you get your uh note open on your
[2:07:51] phone with a little TI did it check mark
[2:07:54] got it done one chapter and you'll do
[2:07:56] that for a
[2:07:59] while oh this is a long
[2:08:02] one so I I'll do half today and half
[2:08:12] tomorrow I told so and so I'd be so and
[2:08:15] so let me tell you something some of you
[2:08:16] are late all the
[2:08:18] time you're never early you're going to
[2:08:22] be late for your
[2:08:24] funeral you probably late for your
[2:08:29] wedding the only reason why you're still
[2:08:31] that way is because people tolerate
[2:08:33] it if somebody would ever hold you
[2:08:36] accountable I mean really hold you
[2:08:38] accountable you'd be surprised what you
[2:08:40] can
[2:08:41] do when years ago I used to talk to
[2:08:44] people and I'd say if you pick out your
[2:08:46] outfit my goodness
[2:08:51] what about this assassin let's talk
[2:08:53] about that just one minute I I'm going
[2:08:54] to take a few minutes here what about
[2:08:56] that
[2:08:57] assassin how horrible how hideous how
[2:09:01] awful we don't know the story I don't
[2:09:04] care the I don't care the motive
[2:09:07] hidious awful horrible could have
[2:09:11] perhaps gotten by with it but he
[2:09:14] won't they're going to find him he's not
[2:09:18] in the system
[2:09:21] they've already got his DNA off of his
[2:09:23] water
[2:09:26] bottle but he's not in the system that's
[2:09:28] okay take a little longer they'll get
[2:09:29] him they're on it they're looking for
[2:09:31] him they wouldn't have even known what
[2:09:34] he looked
[2:09:36] like he was in the city 10 days and wore
[2:09:40] a
[2:09:42] mask until that last
[2:09:47] day when the little waitress at
[2:09:49] Starbucks flirted back
[2:09:53] and wanted to see his
[2:09:55] face and pretty boy just pulled his mask
[2:09:58] down and smiled a Playboy
[2:10:00] smile and the camera
[2:10:03] did he's on there hundreds of camera
[2:10:08] foot hundreds of different instances of
[2:10:10] him always in a
[2:10:12] mask and the commentator on the news
[2:10:15] said don't you just love
[2:10:19] vanity he said vanity will get you when
[2:10:22] nothing else
[2:10:25] will that's how the enemy
[2:10:28] Works he's so slick he'll try to fool us
[2:10:33] but he's
[2:10:34] defeated he is 100%
[2:10:38] defeated don't you let him have
[2:10:41] advantage in your life when that
[2:10:43] unbelief Creeps in do something about it
[2:10:46] get under the word this is why preaching
[2:10:48] is important this is why listening to
[2:10:50] the message is important that's why
[2:10:52] hearing the voice is
[2:10:54] important fathers you're doing something
[2:10:56] right when you bring your children to
[2:10:58] church instead of sending them to
[2:11:03] church a real man doesn't send his wife
[2:11:05] and children to church he brings them to
[2:11:09] church I've been around this thing long
[2:11:11] enough that I knew a bunch of men that
[2:11:12] wouldn't come in and sit in the church
[2:11:14] but they would bring their families to
[2:11:16] church and sit in the car till church
[2:11:18] was over I respected that because at
[2:11:21] least the children didn't beg to stay at
[2:11:24] home with
[2:11:25] [Music]
[2:11:27] Daddy and guess what would happen when
[2:11:29] the fire would get to fall in on the
[2:11:32] inside one by one you'd see the
[2:11:35] Curious come peeking in the door the
[2:11:39] next thing you know conviction would
[2:11:40] strike just get them on the property
[2:11:43] folks God knows how to do his
[2:11:46] business he knows how to get a hold of
[2:11:48] somebody's heart
[2:11:51] you if you'll keep bringing them you'll
[2:11:53] pass Something On to the Next
[2:11:56] Generation that'll make a difference in
[2:11:58] their life Romans 10:17 Faith cometh by
[2:12:00] hearing hearing by the word of God I got
[2:12:02] to stop hello it's 8 809 in the message
[2:12:06] the greatest battle ever fault listen
[2:12:07] this carefully but your mind accepts it
[2:12:12] it grasps it what is your mind
[2:12:16] controlled
[2:12:18] by your spirit
[2:12:21] and your spirit catches the word of
[2:12:25] God and that's the thing that's got life
[2:12:30] in
[2:12:31] it remember when God breathed Spirit
[2:12:35] life Spirit breath into Adam Adam became
[2:12:39] a living
[2:12:41] Soul he was a body first then God added
[2:12:45] his spirit and when the spirit breath a
[2:12:48] ruach of God went into Adam he became a
[2:12:50] living Soul he was able to contact his
[2:12:53] environment around him mind will and
[2:12:58] emotions brother brandom is is giving us
[2:13:00] the right descriptions here your spirit
[2:13:03] catches the word of God and that's the
[2:13:04] thing that's got life in it what the
[2:13:07] word of God it brings life into you into
[2:13:11] your spirit the what the word of
[2:13:15] God not the radio the word of
[2:13:18] God when that takes place listen listen
[2:13:21] when that takes place when life comes
[2:13:23] down that channel into
[2:13:26] you the word of God is manifested in you
[2:13:30] that's the only way your your Fallen
[2:13:32] human Spirit can be regenerated and
[2:13:34] remade into the resurrected Spirit of
[2:13:36] Christ it has to come down that channel
[2:13:39] into you and so that it can then
[2:13:41] manifest in you he said and here's he
[2:13:44] tells us right here how to see that
[2:13:46] happen if ye abide in me and my words
[2:13:48] abide in you then ask what you will
[2:13:53] yes the next paragraph then then what
[2:13:56] does that
[2:13:58] do he said from the middle of your
[2:14:02] heart which is the
[2:14:04] soul from There Goes
[2:14:07] Forth
[2:14:09] feeding every
[2:14:14] channel from the spirit through the soul
[2:14:18] feeding the Mind feeding
[2:14:21] influencing the
[2:14:23] will influencing the
[2:14:26] emotion somebody said I thought it was
[2:14:28] the other way around you'll hear him say
[2:14:30] it both ways this is the biblical
[2:14:33] way this lines up with the very meaning
[2:14:37] of the word Body Soul and
[2:14:41] Spirit you receive the word of God into
[2:14:44] your
[2:14:46] spirit from that channel of
[2:14:49] inspiration and then it goes through
[2:14:52] your soul your mind it works through
[2:14:55] your mind that's why you got to be
[2:14:56] careful that your mind doesn't raise up
[2:14:58] to reject
[2:15:00] truth just because the first time you
[2:15:02] hear it you don't understand it don't
[2:15:04] you do that don't you let your
[2:15:06] misunderstanding cause you to reject
[2:15:09] something take it to the Lord take it to
[2:15:13] prayer and see if God won't Quicken it
[2:15:15] make it real then that word of God are
[2:15:17] you still here are you worn out can I
[2:15:20] have a few more minutes
[2:15:21] we're going to feed you a great big meal
[2:15:24] a wonderful time of food and fellowship
[2:15:26] in a moment or two I know that you're
[2:15:28] looking forward to that look forward to
[2:15:29] this
[2:15:31] first then it starts moving through the
[2:15:34] will and I want you to know that's where
[2:15:36] our trouble that is often the hitch in
[2:15:39] our get up that will that stubborn will
[2:15:43] that we that we reinforce instead of
[2:15:45] bringing it underneath submission to the
[2:15:47] word to the spirit it starts feeding out
[2:15:50] through the through the Mind through the
[2:15:52] will and then hear this just a moment
[2:15:54] and then hear this it starts filtering
[2:15:56] through the emotions and those emotions
[2:15:59] are not your enemy God gave you your
[2:16:01] emotions for a very powerful purpose
[2:16:04] they serve a very powerful purpose in
[2:16:06] your life there's nothing wrong with
[2:16:08] emotion except that you are not to be
[2:16:11] led by your emotion you are to be led by
[2:16:14] the word of God in your
[2:16:16] spirit in fact you're supposed to pull
[2:16:18] your emotions with you
[2:16:21] yes into
[2:16:24] truth your emotions will tell you you
[2:16:27] you don't feel anything so you must be
[2:16:30] disconnected what have you
[2:16:33] done the sirene starts going off
[2:16:39] woo and people who have sat under the
[2:16:42] revealed word of God for for for years
[2:16:45] for decades will start believing a lie
[2:16:51] I've committed the unpardonable sin woo
[2:16:53] woo woo I'm rejected woo woo it works
[2:16:57] for everyone else but me
[2:17:01] woo and then what do you do when that
[2:17:04] thought comes it's your responsibility
[2:17:06] to grab that thing right out of the air
[2:17:09] snatch it down and command in Jesus name
[2:17:12] you bow to the authority of God's word
[2:17:16] you're a
[2:17:18] liar I have not committed an
[2:17:20] unpardonable sin I have not blasphemed
[2:17:23] the Holy
[2:17:24] Ghost my sin is no greater than anybody
[2:17:26] else's sin and by the way devil what sin
[2:17:29] are you talking about
[2:17:31] anyway the grace of God the blood of
[2:17:34] Jesus has
[2:17:36] [Music]
[2:17:39] finished when all that's done do you
[2:17:42] feel different you
[2:17:44] may you often will do you always feel
[2:17:48] different no
[2:17:52] I can hear Brother random
[2:17:53] screaming more than once what the
[2:17:56] feelings have to do with
[2:17:58] it you see we've given them way more
[2:18:00] attention than they ought to
[2:18:02] have we've let things Lodge up here that
[2:18:05] we should have let burn off a long time
[2:18:07] ago are you still with me you've got to
[2:18:10] stop that he said the trouble of it
[2:18:13] is from the middle of the heart which is
[2:18:15] a soul from There Goes Forth feeding
[2:18:16] every channel the trouble of it is we're
[2:18:18] standing in here with a lot of doubt
[2:18:21] what that's the trouble I feel I'm being
[2:18:24] honest that's the trouble I feel right
[2:18:27] now that's why some of you are having
[2:18:29] such a hard time accepting such a simple
[2:18:31] truth something that you already know
[2:18:34] something that you could preach better
[2:18:35] than
[2:18:35] me but you're sitting there as though it
[2:18:38] has no effect as though it's not even
[2:18:40] sinking in and I'm telling you the
[2:18:43] reason for that is we have allowed
[2:18:45] unbelief to raise up in our hearts and
[2:18:48] if you filter the word through unbelief
[2:18:51] you won't believe any of it before it's
[2:18:55] over you find the
[2:18:58] website that says that ain't true and
[2:19:00] that ain't true and that ain't true and
[2:19:03] the next thing you'll
[2:19:06] know when these doubts were presented to
[2:19:08] me the first time it was we don't know
[2:19:11] whether we believe brother random or not
[2:19:14] okay that doesn't set off a bunch of
[2:19:17] alarms in my head the enemy doesn't want
[2:19:19] anybody to believe something something
[2:19:20] that'll help
[2:19:23] him God's word calls for a total
[2:19:26] separation from unbelief that's where
[2:19:29] the problem gets a little sticky doesn't
[2:19:31] it well I don't know about the bridge
[2:19:33] well I don't know about the cloud well I
[2:19:34] don't know about this well I don't know
[2:19:35] about that well I don't know about the
[2:19:37] picture and used to well I don't know
[2:19:40] about so that's one thing and you handle
[2:19:42] that problem another
[2:19:45] way next thing you know somebody says
[2:19:47] well I don't even know if the gifts and
[2:19:49] miracles are and and and and
[2:19:51] Supernatural power of God is for today
[2:19:53] you see what happened you started
[2:19:56] discounting anything that you heard that
[2:19:58] was Supernatural deciding there must be
[2:20:00] some other explanation for it the next
[2:20:02] thing you know you've opened up your
[2:20:03] heart to doubt I'm being honest here I'm
[2:20:06] just telling you how the seed of
[2:20:07] discrepancy works and the next thing you
[2:20:11] know well I thought I had a miracle I I
[2:20:14] thought God give me a miracle but you
[2:20:15] know maybe it was the medicine I I mean
[2:20:17] I I
[2:20:22] then the next thing you hear we we we we
[2:20:24] now believe in a
[2:20:26] trinity how do you go from doubt in the
[2:20:28] cloud to beli in the
[2:20:30] Trinity doubt in the Supernatural sign
[2:20:32] to believing that God's three
[2:20:34] people how do you go
[2:20:39] there do you hear what I'm saying you
[2:20:42] open up the door and the devil moves in
[2:20:45] suitcase and
[2:20:47] all there's got to be a way there's got
[2:20:49] to be a way to to to approach something
[2:20:53] that won't
[2:20:55] jeopardize every bit of
[2:20:58] Truth every bit of foundation that you
[2:21:03] have well I'm not even sure that baptism
[2:21:05] in the name of Jesus is right and I'm
[2:21:06] not even sure that immersion is right
[2:21:08] and I'm not even sure and and and my you
[2:21:11] go on and on and on and on and then you
[2:21:13] know we we we you want to find a church
[2:21:15] you got to find a place to worship or
[2:21:17] whever you go will you go to non-
[2:21:18] denomination will you go to baptist will
[2:21:20] you go to meth is what will you do what
[2:21:21] will you settle for when you know the
[2:21:25] truth I'll be honest I don't know how
[2:21:27] anybody could leave the revelation of
[2:21:29] Jesus Christ and and find their way back
[2:21:32] to some
[2:21:33] system some bunch of dead burdess I
[2:21:36] don't know how anybody could and and
[2:21:38] then the next thing you know no can't go
[2:21:40] can't go to charismatic can't go to
[2:21:41] Pentecostal because the one thing we did
[2:21:43] learn around the message is all that's
[2:21:44] of the
[2:21:45] devil what a shame brother Bram said I'm
[2:21:49] Pentecostal from the top of my head head
[2:21:50] to the souls of my feet not by
[2:21:52] denomination but by
[2:21:55] experience we need that
[2:21:58] Pentecostal experience a birth a new
[2:22:02] birth we need a new
[2:22:05] birth I I had one I'm not I'm not
[2:22:08] boasting I'm just telling I said to my
[2:22:11] family I don't even understand the
[2:22:13] language I I don't even understand what
[2:22:16] people say
[2:22:18] today who who people will
[2:22:23] testify musicians just be on guard we'll
[2:22:26] need you in an
[2:22:28] hour people will testify and they'll I
[2:22:32] got my help at camp
[2:22:35] meeting oh God moved for me at camp
[2:22:37] meeting he did so many things for me at
[2:22:39] camp meeting I just felt like a new
[2:22:40] creat I'm so thankful I believe it I'm
[2:22:42] I'm I'm so thankful for that and then
[2:22:46] the next thing you
[2:22:48] hear somebody I'm in the throws of
[2:22:52] Despair I can't find
[2:22:57] God
[2:23:00] my my manners are
[2:23:04] gone my language is like the
[2:23:08] gutter how do we how do we fall how do
[2:23:11] we how do we do it so
[2:23:14] quickly all I know is brother gy I know
[2:23:17] it's wrong to compare experiences we all
[2:23:20] have different experiences with God I'm
[2:23:22] I'm I'm ashamed I ever even started
[2:23:24] going down this road but I just wanted
[2:23:26] you to
[2:23:30] know he met
[2:23:32] me seven-year old
[2:23:35] boy Heaven came
[2:23:38] down filled my soul the Holy Ghost in
[2:23:42] fire occupied my life I didn't know all
[2:23:45] the truth I didn't have all the truth
[2:23:47] but it led me that's what the Holy Ghost
[2:23:49] will do it'll Lead You In guide you and
[2:23:51] direct you into all truth that's what
[2:23:54] the Holy Ghost will
[2:23:56] do but whatever it was that I
[2:24:00] got some say well it might have just
[2:24:02] been on your flesh some say well it
[2:24:04] might just been on your soul some might
[2:24:07] all I know is
[2:24:10] this from that moment until this there's
[2:24:14] never been anything out
[2:24:17] there that attracted me
[2:24:20] like this
[2:24:22] word
[2:24:24] hallelujah hallelujah we move from glory
[2:24:27] to glory from strink to shrink from
[2:24:29] Faith to Faith I know we slide back a
[2:24:31] little I know we get cold I know the
[2:24:34] flame
[2:24:35] flickers but I'm here to tell you
[2:24:37] tonight that even though the flame is
[2:24:38] flickered it has the fire of God in my
[2:24:41] heart has never gone
[2:24:43] out and if there was ever a time that I
[2:24:46] didn't feel connected to him I had let
[2:24:49] my mind
[2:24:51] get between me and God I let my junk get
[2:24:54] between me and God I let my thoughts get
[2:24:57] between me and
[2:24:59] God and I didn't hear sound counsel and
[2:25:02] I wouldn't listen to good
[2:25:04] help I decided that I I knew it better
[2:25:08] and I and somehow I I I would need
[2:25:11] something people even slide all the way
[2:25:13] back into this mentality that the blood
[2:25:15] is not enough it's enough it's enough if
[2:25:18] you'll surrender it's enough if you can
[2:25:20] only
[2:25:21] believe the grace of God is
[2:25:25] enough you don't have to hail Mary you
[2:25:28] don't have to pray the rosary you don't
[2:25:31] have to confess to a
[2:25:34] priest I could say a lot of other
[2:25:37] things you don't have to have the belt
[2:25:41] buckle you don't have to only press play
[2:25:43] and
[2:25:46] Obey it's the same kind of
[2:25:49] dogmas amen same kind of dogmas what
[2:25:53] you've got to do is just believe with if
[2:25:56] you can only believe you can only
[2:25:58] believe you don't have to lie about your
[2:26:00] doubt do what the man scripture said I
[2:26:03] preached whole series Lord I believe
[2:26:05] help thou my unbel I believe I believe
[2:26:08] let your spirit testify I believe the
[2:26:11] mind willing the motion
[2:26:13] says Lord help thou my
[2:26:16] unbelief are you here I'm closing you've
[2:26:19] got to stop that
[2:26:20] the trouble of it is we're standing here
[2:26:22] in a lot of Doubt trying to accept
[2:26:23] what's out there you've got to stop that
[2:26:25] and come down that Channel with the true
[2:26:27] word of God and then it goes out itself
[2:26:30] automatically once it comes in it starts
[2:26:33] moving out it's what's on the inside he
[2:26:36] said that's the thing that counts is is
[2:26:38] the inside Satan approaches
[2:26:42] us from the inside
[2:26:51] birth
[2:26:52] pains you said well you got the same
[2:26:54] Choice
[2:26:56] today it's not just written words he's
[2:26:58] talking about he's talking about
[2:27:00] quickening living words in you you let
[2:27:04] God make one truth alive you let God
[2:27:06] make one truth alive to you and then
[2:27:08] hold on to
[2:27:09] that brother Bron said tell somebody
[2:27:12] tell somebody you let one truth be
[2:27:14] quickened to you by the Holy Ghost and
[2:27:16] then you testify
[2:27:21] he said if all you know how to do is
[2:27:22] tell somebody how your candle got
[2:27:27] lit tell
[2:27:29] it speak it confess
[2:27:32] it he said well you got the same Choice
[2:27:35] today she's fixing to bring forth the
[2:27:37] perfect word back there and the word is
[2:27:39] coming for the word Bride As a woman is
[2:27:41] the part of a man taken from him so the
[2:27:44] church will have to be a
[2:27:46] word abiding church every word
[2:27:55] word of the
[2:28:00] Bible please don't come to us trying to
[2:28:03] convince us that every word that comes
[2:28:05] out of a prophet's mouth is
[2:28:10] infallible please don't try to tell us
[2:28:14] we don't see it in the Old Testament we
[2:28:15] don't see it in the New Testament I
[2:28:17] don't know why God was break his order
[2:28:19] today there is no Prophet who is
[2:28:23] inherent not even the
[2:28:25] pope but there is something I want you
[2:28:28] to know that is not that is not to pull
[2:28:30] down this glorious message that we have
[2:28:33] I needed it God sent it it is Daily's
[2:28:37] bread for
[2:28:39] me but I must understand that I can't
[2:28:43] take one thing and go out on a limb I
[2:28:46] must take everything that includes
[2:28:49] feelings and vision
[2:28:53] back to the word he said so the church
[2:28:55] will have to be a word abiding church
[2:28:58] every word of the Bible not systems
[2:29:03] dogmas or nothing added to it it'll have
[2:29:05] to be in an
[2:29:07] unadulterated
[2:29:09] pure virgin word
[2:29:12] right you see the way it works through
[2:29:15] the office of a prophet is revelation is
[2:29:17] Progressive they don't want you to say
[2:29:19] it but it's still the truth truth and
[2:29:21] that's why you can find a quote where
[2:29:23] he's preaching about preaching hell
[2:29:25] Eternal and then hell not
[2:29:28] Eternal that's why you can hear body S
[2:29:32] Body Spirit soul and Body Soul
[2:29:35] Spirit we come to different
[2:29:37] understanding at different times in our
[2:29:39] life somebody say well then if you can't
[2:29:41] trust it all you can't trust any of it
[2:29:42] well that's an awful rough thing to say
[2:29:45] because God's given us the absolute
[2:29:47] word so we take everything just right
[2:29:50] back to that word and guess what you're
[2:29:52] going to find it fitting in
[2:29:56] [Music]
[2:29:58] there Hallelujah so the church will have
[2:30:00] to be a word abiding church every word
[2:30:02] of the Bible not systems talk pure
[2:30:04] virgin word pure virgin word right now
[2:30:09] musicians are are truly
[2:30:18] coming CU it's not nice to have you up
[2:30:23] here I'm not ready to share this but I'm
[2:30:25] going to I haven't properly laid the
[2:30:28] foundation for it but I want to share
[2:30:29] just a few Thoughts with
[2:30:31] you and we can do it
[2:30:36] quickly I'm going to sometime tomorrow
[2:30:40] probably I'm going to try to give you
[2:30:42] some
[2:30:44] practical things that you can apply in
[2:30:47] your life that will help you
[2:30:50] to make sure that his words are abiding
[2:30:53] in you and and and and without laying a
[2:30:56] foundation let me say that one of those
[2:30:58] ways is to meditate on God's
[2:31:02] word to ponder
[2:31:05] it you see in Psalm 19:14 the psalmist
[2:31:09] said let the words of my mouth and the
[2:31:12] meditation of my heart be acceptable in
[2:31:15] thy sight oh Lord my my strength and my
[2:31:17] redeemer
[2:31:20] and and I want to say this to you in the
[2:31:21] Old
[2:31:23] Testament two Hebrew words are
[2:31:26] translated as
[2:31:28] meditate it's up here for you to see one
[2:31:31] suggests you're going to find it very
[2:31:33] odd one suggests a low pitched muttering
[2:31:39] sound and the other means to be taken up
[2:31:43] or
[2:31:45] absorbed by something isn't that strange
[2:31:48] two different Hebrew words both of them
[2:31:50] translated in English meditate one means
[2:31:53] a low pitch muttering sound the other
[2:31:54] means to be taken up or absorbed by
[2:31:59] something taken together we get the idea
[2:32:02] of someone
[2:32:04] pondering a Biblical
[2:32:08] text quietly vocalizing
[2:32:11] it
[2:32:13] repeatedly did anybody hear sister
[2:32:16] joce's testimony the last testimony
[2:32:18] service she gave us her testimony of how
[2:32:21] this works in her
[2:32:23] life it gives us when we take those two
[2:32:26] meanings together it gives us the idea
[2:32:27] of someone pondering a Biblical text
[2:32:29] quietly vocalizing it repeatedly it can
[2:32:31] even mean to
[2:32:34] coup or to
[2:32:37] growl God
[2:32:39] forbid to utter a sound to
[2:32:44] moan you'll get throwed out of the Youth
[2:32:47] Camp if you're doing too much moaning in
[2:32:50] some places to read in an
[2:32:53] undertone to mutter while meditating to
[2:32:55] plot to speak to Proclaim it's a big
[2:32:58] word means a lot of different
[2:33:01] things I know that all theologians don't
[2:33:03] have it right but maybe ever now and
[2:33:05] then again they get something right so I
[2:33:07] I put this one definition here for
[2:33:09] you from ji Packer meditation is the
[2:33:13] activity of calling to mind and thinking
[2:33:17] over and dwelling on and applying to
[2:33:20] oneself the various things that one
[2:33:22] knows about the works and ways and
[2:33:25] purposes and Promises of God this is one
[2:33:27] way we can make sure that the word of
[2:33:29] God abides in us because we're abiding
[2:33:32] in it because we're pondering it
[2:33:35] meditation is the activity of calling to
[2:33:37] mind thinking over dwelling on applying
[2:33:39] to oneself the various things that one
[2:33:42] knows about the works and ways and
[2:33:43] purposes and
[2:33:45] Promises of
[2:33:48] God it goes it is an activity of holy
[2:33:52] thought consciously performed in the
[2:33:54] presence of God under the eye of God by
[2:33:56] the help of God as a means of
[2:34:00] communion with God isn't that
[2:34:04] good meditation based on God's
[2:34:08] word can have a tremendous effect on
[2:34:10] helping us
[2:34:11] overcome negative thought patterns are
[2:34:14] you here I want you if you didn't hear
[2:34:16] anything else come to alert please hear
[2:34:19] this psychologists recommend paying
[2:34:21] attention to your thought
[2:34:24] patterns I don't care about that you you
[2:34:26] might ought to consider some
[2:34:28] things it's a good idea let me just take
[2:34:31] that away instead of saying psychologist
[2:34:33] recommend pastors
[2:34:35] recommend does that make you feel more
[2:34:37] comfortable brother Shel recommends
[2:34:40] paying
[2:34:41] attention to your thought patterns yes
[2:34:44] sir when you recognize a negative
[2:34:46] pattern work to change your thoughts
[2:34:49] gradually
[2:34:50] won't happen overnight try to
[2:34:53] restructure the negative sentences that
[2:34:55] you repeat in your mind with something
[2:34:59] more positive what could possibly be
[2:35:01] more positive than thinking pondering
[2:35:03] and meditating on God's holy Words of
[2:35:05] Life come on changing a negative thought
[2:35:08] pattern takes approximately 21
[2:35:13] days psychologist didn't say that brain
[2:35:16] scientist
[2:35:17] did takes 21 days to change a negative
[2:35:20] thought pattern especially a critical
[2:35:22] pattern in your life one that's a
[2:35:24] critical of critical nature meaning you
[2:35:27] are under a critical spirit so your mind
[2:35:30] keeps thinking these critical thoughts
[2:35:32] if you don't do something listen this is
[2:35:34] interesting to know if you don't do
[2:35:35] something with the information that you
[2:35:37] hear or receive any new information that
[2:35:39] you hear or receive if you don't do
[2:35:41] something with
[2:35:43] it within 24 to 48
[2:35:46] hours that information will move out of
[2:35:49] your brain
[2:35:50] I've showed you as heat
[2:35:54] energy brain scientists have caught it
[2:35:57] on a brain
[2:35:58] scan it's like a tiny little flash of
[2:36:02] light leaves doesn't matter whether it's
[2:36:05] truth or not if it's truth if you don't
[2:36:07] revisit it if you don't put some effort
[2:36:09] to it if you don't make an effort to
[2:36:11] abide in it and let it abide in you that
[2:36:15] word of God will go right through you
[2:36:17] it'll just burn up like a little energy
[2:36:19] Flash in your
[2:36:22] mind that information will move out of
[2:36:24] your brain is heat energy you must start
[2:36:26] stabilizing this information by engaging
[2:36:29] it in some reinforcing way right I'm
[2:36:31] going to show you some things tomorrow
[2:36:33] how to do it this is how we form such
[2:36:35] great big negative thought Pathways in
[2:36:37] our brain literally by thinking the same
[2:36:39] wrong or negative thoughts of life again
[2:36:41] and again and again you see we rarely
[2:36:43] stop and analyze our thoughts most
[2:36:45] thoughts occur on
[2:36:46] autopilot in our subconscious when they
[2:36:49] come up from our subconscious we rarely
[2:36:51] take the time to decide whether they are
[2:36:54] positive or
[2:36:55] negative or even whether or not they're
[2:36:58] true or not
[2:37:00] true or just an
[2:37:03] unsubstantiated lie to stop them from
[2:37:06] being a habit we need to bring them into
[2:37:09] our Consciousness meaning we need to
[2:37:11] think about what we're
[2:37:13] thinking and that will make them
[2:37:18] malleable this simply means to do it
[2:37:20] with purpose stop and think about what
[2:37:23] you are
[2:37:25] thinking brain science is telling us
[2:37:27] that slowing down our thinking brings
[2:37:29] the thoughts into Consciousness making
[2:37:31] them
[2:37:33] adaptable
[2:37:34] adjustable and better than that
[2:37:37] replaceable am replace a
[2:37:41] lie with the absolute truth do it every
[2:37:44] time do it for 21 days
[2:37:50] make up your mind take one at a time
[2:37:53] Capture One negative
[2:37:56] thought whether it's I'm a loser I'm
[2:37:58] stupid I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm a
[2:38:05] failure let me tell you something a
[2:38:07] failed business a failed marriage
[2:38:11] failing as a parent failing here or
[2:38:15] there or anywhere doesn't make you a
[2:38:17] failure that's right right
[2:38:22] there's not a person in this room that
[2:38:24] hasn't failed at something but that
[2:38:27] doesn't make you a
[2:38:29] failure if you're abiding in the word
[2:38:31] and the word abiding in you you are not
[2:38:34] a failure you are not
[2:38:38] defeated you're not a
[2:38:41] Survivor you're an overcomer greater is
[2:38:44] he that is in you than he that is in the
[2:38:45] world do you believe that it takes 21
[2:38:48] days of this cycling for all the
[2:38:51] necessary protein changes and it is
[2:38:53] registered protein changes to happen to
[2:38:56] create a longterm integrated
[2:38:59] memory and the only answer that we have
[2:39:02] to replacing our negative
[2:39:04] thoughts is to use the word of
[2:39:06] God use it
[2:39:10] daily use it all the time every time
[2:39:16] don't let your mind agree with one
[2:39:21] thought that is not based in the reality
[2:39:25] of God's
[2:39:27] word people say things like I'm dying
[2:39:30] well we all
[2:39:31] are but that's not the confession that
[2:39:33] needs to be coming out of your mouth I'm
[2:39:35] not talking about mind over matter I'm
[2:39:37] not talking about Norman Vincent Peele
[2:39:39] I'm talking about winning the greatest
[2:39:40] battle ever fought the greatest battle
[2:39:43] ever fought was not fought at Normandy
[2:39:45] it wasn't fought in gu Canal it's being
[2:39:47] fought right now in the mind
[2:39:50] in the Battlefield of the Mind of the
[2:39:51] little bride of Jesus Christ the the
[2:39:55] enemy knows that he can't unson you he
[2:39:57] can't take you out from under your
[2:39:59] relationship with Jesus Christ but he
[2:40:02] can affect the fellowship that you have
[2:40:04] with Jesus by lying to you by accusing
[2:40:09] you and by causing you to feel
[2:40:15] disconnected you feel disconnected don't
[2:40:17] blame mama don't blame
[2:40:20] Daddy I don't even want you to blame
[2:40:23] yourself I want you to blame the
[2:40:26] enemy I want you to say you fou devil of
[2:40:31] hell you were created that God could use
[2:40:35] you to perfect me not defeat
[2:40:38] me I'm done with your Twisted truths I'm
[2:40:42] done with your half lies I am what God's
[2:40:46] word says I am
[2:40:53] when somebody I'm closing when somebody
[2:40:55] throws me a LIF
[2:40:58] line I'm not going to look at it and
[2:41:01] determine whether or not I think it has
[2:41:02] the
[2:41:04] strength to save my life that's right if
[2:41:06] it's a John 15
[2:41:08] Lifeline if it's the truth that John 15
[2:41:13] contains even if it don't look strong
[2:41:17] enough even if it doesn't look
[2:41:19] sufficient enough I'm going to take a
[2:41:22] hold of that Lifeline because you know
[2:41:24] what you'll find in your hands it'll
[2:41:30] become how could it be this
[2:41:37] easy how could it bring healing to
[2:41:40] mental
[2:41:44] illness how could it bring the end to my
[2:41:47] anxiety my panic attacks my
[2:41:52] depression how could it be that
[2:41:57] easy I don't know where anyone ever got
[2:42:00] the idea that we don't believe in
[2:42:05] medication medication serves a
[2:42:08] purpose we need it
[2:42:12] sometime sometime we don't have a
[2:42:15] stroke you know we just decide I I don't
[2:42:18] don't think I want to have a stroke so
[2:42:22] I'll maybe I'll take a little help I'll
[2:42:25] try to get a little exercise I'll try to
[2:42:27] eat a little better and I'll get a
[2:42:28] little help until I can get it under
[2:42:30] control the same thing with even even an
[2:42:33] emotional uh
[2:42:35] disruption or anxiety or
[2:42:38] sometimes and we understand that
[2:42:41] 100% and and and we would want you to do
[2:42:44] whatever you need to do to get you
[2:42:47] through this place
[2:42:49] yeah but that's short
[2:42:52] term it's short term because it doesn't
[2:42:55] take too long before the side effects
[2:42:59] begin to work against your
[2:43:01] body you can say Amen or om me or
[2:43:03] nothing doesn't matter now but I have a
[2:43:07] solution there is a
[2:43:09] Lifeline Jesus said I'm the vine you're
[2:43:13] the branches if you will stay connected
[2:43:15] to
[2:43:18] me and here's what we need to know the
[2:43:20] devil cannot cut you off he doesn't hold
[2:43:23] the pruning
[2:43:24] shears the devil cannot cut you off from
[2:43:27] the Vine I want you to say this right
[2:43:29] now the devil cannot cut me off from the
[2:43:33] vine what Vine Jesus the John 15 Vine I
[2:43:36] am the vine he can't he cannot cut me
[2:43:40] off he is not the husbandman the
[2:43:43] husbandman is the eternal spirit of the
[2:43:45] father Jesus said my father's the
[2:43:47] husbandman he's the one that had takes
[2:43:49] the pruning shears cuts off the dead
[2:43:52] Vine the dead Vines dead branches excuse
[2:43:54] me he's the one that cuts off the dead
[2:43:56] branches he's the one that cuts back and
[2:43:58] trims and prunes and purges those that
[2:44:00] aren't producing all the fruit that they
[2:44:02] need to produce it's it's the spirit of
[2:44:04] the father it's the eternal spirit of
[2:44:05] the Father the devil cannot kill
[2:44:10] you I know the church teach you
[2:44:12] something else the devil can't kill
[2:44:15] you you will never cause me to believe
[2:44:19] in a
[2:44:20] God who has created an enemy more
[2:44:24] powerful than
[2:44:27] himself that's not even logical it's not
[2:44:30] theological and it's certainly not
[2:44:31] logical God did not give the devil more
[2:44:34] power than he
[2:44:37] has so a better doctor a better Hospital
[2:44:40] a
[2:44:42] better that's not going to change things
[2:44:44] for you I know we do that sometime we
[2:44:47] think that way sometime if I could have
[2:44:49] only got my my mama to a better doctor
[2:44:51] we went to that old crazy hospital blah
[2:44:53] blah blah blah blah you need to
[2:44:55] understand as
[2:44:57] Believers God has a plan we do the best
[2:44:59] we
[2:45:00] can but life is a VOR these things are
[2:45:03] in his hands you understand that don't
[2:45:05] you from the
[2:45:06] scripture I want you to know that no one
[2:45:09] can cut you
[2:45:12] off the enemy only has the power that
[2:45:15] God allows him
[2:45:19] and in your life as an individual he
[2:45:21] only has power over you when you
[2:45:25] surrender your own authority right then
[2:45:28] he'll move in and brother he'll come in
[2:45:29] I'm telling you he'll bring the whole
[2:45:31] circus with him when he comes he won't
[2:45:33] come in this little stranger he'll come
[2:45:35] in with a whole circus he'll bring all
[2:45:36] the stuff that comes with it the all the
[2:45:39] stuff that comes with him he'll bring it
[2:45:41] to your life but he cannot cut you off
[2:45:44] and God cannot cut you off God cannot
[2:45:47] cut you off if
[2:45:50] his well I just don't like it when we
[2:45:52] put limits on God we
[2:45:53] didn't he put it
[2:45:57] there he said I will never leave
[2:46:01] you so if we are
[2:46:04] disconnected or more importantly if we
[2:46:07] feel right that we are
[2:46:10] disconnected God didn't do it and the
[2:46:13] reality is you can't even completely
[2:46:14] blame the
[2:46:15] devil and the only way that you can
[2:46:18] solve the whole problem problem is to
[2:46:20] make sure make sure make sure that you
[2:46:23] are abiding in
[2:46:25] him and that his words are abiding in
[2:46:27] you make sure that you're doing
[2:46:29] something with those
[2:46:31] thoughts if you can't do it on your own
[2:46:34] find
[2:46:36] somebody make them a sounding board tell
[2:46:40] me what to do with these thoughts
[2:46:42] somebody say I can never be that
[2:46:43] transparent you should if you need to be
[2:46:46] you should I don't know what to do with
[2:46:49] this so I'm going to tell you and then
[2:46:50] you help me turn it around you help me
[2:46:53] make something positive out of it with
[2:46:56] every Temptation with every every every
[2:46:58] Temptation with all of them every one of
[2:47:00] them amen amen amen he will do
[2:47:04] what make a way of Escape it's in our
[2:47:08] hands now I want to look over this
[2:47:10] congregation in closing tonight I want
[2:47:11] to talk to the young people the old
[2:47:13] people and everybody in
[2:47:15] between as a as a local body we've been
[2:47:18] in a in a strange place for a
[2:47:20] month we are
[2:47:25] processing
[2:47:26] tragedy
[2:47:28] misunderstanding
[2:47:30] persecution we're processing loss grief
[2:47:34] pain so many questions more questions it
[2:47:38] seems it answers but the reality is we
[2:47:41] only need one
[2:47:45] answer he's not a thought or an idea
[2:47:49] the word is a
[2:47:51] person his name is Jesus are you here
[2:47:56] are you with me so we come in with all
[2:47:59] kinds of different mindsets we come in
[2:48:00] in different spiritual conditions
[2:48:02] sometimes we come in encouraged why are
[2:48:05] you why do you sometimes come in
[2:48:07] encourage I'll tell you why because
[2:48:09] you've been doing the right
[2:48:11] thing you pulled your Journal
[2:48:14] out we'll get to it tomorrow you pulled
[2:48:16] your Journal out and you started reading
[2:48:18] about the things that God has spoken to
[2:48:19] your heart from his
[2:48:22] word you you you you you press you Press
[2:48:25] replay rewind in your mind and you
[2:48:28] started going over some things that God
[2:48:30] has done in your
[2:48:31] life sister Kathy had something
[2:48:34] extremely I'll leave it to her to share
[2:48:36] with you she wants to do so extremely
[2:48:38] disappointing
[2:48:41] happened just
[2:48:43] recently something that could have been
[2:48:47] very very very helpful in her
[2:48:52] life and it didn't turn
[2:48:55] out exactly like it should
[2:48:59] have most of the time when you put
[2:49:01] lawyers between you and the solution and
[2:49:04] you have to do it in situations like
[2:49:07] hers she was just part of a big big
[2:49:09] thing she didn't do it part of a big
[2:49:11] thing she was wronged taken advantage of
[2:49:15] and suffered much pain and physical
[2:49:18] problem s and surgeries and all kinds of
[2:49:20] stuff over that but you know who
[2:49:23] prospered not the poor people that
[2:49:27] suffered the in the inet right the
[2:49:30] attorneys when that word first came that
[2:49:33] it was going to be
[2:49:36] this instead of this it knocked the
[2:49:39] breath out of
[2:49:41] her she she did what you ought to do in
[2:49:44] a situation like that she reached out to
[2:49:46] somebody I don't I I pray that you don't
[2:49:49] feel like I'm betraying your
[2:49:51] confidence her exact testimony to me was
[2:49:55] I am so
[2:49:57] discouraged now that wasn't a lie that
[2:49:59] was a truth in that moment she was so
[2:50:02] discouraged so I started
[2:50:04] praying I shared with her what little
[2:50:07] bit I could and I reminded her of the
[2:50:10] goodness of
[2:50:12] God and I left her with
[2:50:15] it I don't live at her house she don't
[2:50:18] live at my my house I couldn't be with
[2:50:20] her the whole time it wasn't too
[2:50:24] long but the testimony started coming
[2:50:27] back you know I got to
[2:50:30] thinking how God is always provided how
[2:50:34] God is always seen me through how God
[2:50:37] has always made a way where there was no
[2:50:39] way how God has given me a miracle that
[2:50:41] I didn't expect here's something I
[2:50:44] expected didn't turn out like I expected
[2:50:46] all I need is for God to come and do
[2:50:48] something
[2:50:50] unexpected but I'm no longer
[2:50:53] discouraged I promise you I didn't lift
[2:50:55] her up I promise you it wasn't me who
[2:50:58] did that all she needed was just a
[2:51:00] little bit of a
[2:51:03] Lifeline a little bit of a sounding
[2:51:05] board and what she did was she just
[2:51:07] choked up on the
[2:51:11] Rope she just pulled herself up a little
[2:51:15] higher on the John 15 lifeline
[2:51:18] and she said I'm going to abide in
[2:51:22] him
[2:51:27] hello I'm going to trust in him I'm
[2:51:29] going to let his words abide in me yes
[2:51:32] come on this is the way life is it's
[2:51:34] full of disappointments yes don't you go
[2:51:39] an extra
[2:51:42] day now here's the excuse that some
[2:51:45] people use sometime around here my
[2:51:47] pastor is so tired
[2:51:49] I see that after he through preaching on
[2:51:51] a Sunday he doesn't hardly have the the
[2:51:53] strength sometime to pray for me let me
[2:51:56] tell you something that's true I'll be
[2:51:58] honest that's true but I'm not the only
[2:52:00] one in here who can get a prayer
[2:52:03] through so don't look at my Frailty
[2:52:05] don't look at where I am don't look at
[2:52:07] what I've gone through You Look to Him
[2:52:10] you come up anyway if you spent three or
[2:52:13] four days in a disconnected place if you
[2:52:15] spent 48 hours in a disconnected place
[2:52:18] if you've been 24 hours in a place where
[2:52:20] you feel like you can't reach up and get
[2:52:21] a hold of him get yourself up here after
[2:52:26] the word is
[2:52:27] preached I'm I need somebody to pray for
[2:52:30] me why are you so
[2:52:35] quiet I got to have prayer I got to have
[2:52:39] help I got to have it now remember you
[2:52:42] don't need a prophecy you don't need a
[2:52:44] word from the Lord you don't need to
[2:52:46] somebody to tell you what the problem is
[2:52:48] right
[2:52:49] you know what the problem is Sir you
[2:52:51] don't need all that thing you just need
[2:52:53] somebody to come alongside of you with
[2:52:55] their
[2:52:57] faith and say I'm going to pray that God
[2:53:00] will strengthen your
[2:53:01] grip don't you turn loose of the
[2:53:04] lifeline cuz how you feel is not what it
[2:53:07] is you young people you've been through
[2:53:10] a lot you're living in a in a in an evil
[2:53:14] hour I know that uh people like to
[2:53:17] compare
[2:53:18] generation with other generations with
[2:53:20] this generation it it it hardly
[2:53:23] Compares because evil is so accessible
[2:53:26] today filth is so accessible it's
[2:53:29] dangerous living living in leod deia but
[2:53:32] let me tell you something if you are a
[2:53:34] part of this final economy that God has
[2:53:36] designed this last day move of God this
[2:53:40] calling out of a bride to give her an
[2:53:42] overcoming power to get above the spirit
[2:53:44] of the age if you're a part of that if
[2:53:46] your name was found written in the
[2:53:48] Lamb's Book of of life before the
[2:53:49] foundation of the world before the lamb
[2:53:51] was ever slain if you are a part of that
[2:53:54] you
[2:53:56] win you make it
[2:53:58] through you finish
[2:54:01] well if you'll remember the
[2:54:04] word not 16 survival not 13 survival
[2:54:07] strategies not 19 survival strategies
[2:54:09] for the end time
[2:54:13] one catch the
[2:54:15] lifeline catch the John 15 Lifeline I am
[2:54:18] the
[2:54:19] you're the branches separated from me
[2:54:22] you'll dry up and die but if you let me
[2:54:25] abide my words abide in you as you abide
[2:54:28] in me Jesus
[2:54:31] said you'll overcome you won't always
[2:54:34] feel your connection but it'll be
[2:54:37] there it's just like that little boy
[2:54:39] let's stand woo sorry wow
[2:54:43] 9:00 wow did that happen fast
[2:54:50] you'll be like that little
[2:54:52] boy flying a kite above the
[2:54:57] clouds can't even see the kite got the
[2:55:00] string in his
[2:55:01] hand fellow comes by what are you doing
[2:55:03] son I'm flying a kite well I don't see a
[2:55:08] kite all I see is clouds it's up there

[2:55:13] there sir Mr is up there I can't see it
[2:55:17] can you see it no no mister I can't see

[2:55:26] up there he said CU ever now and again
[2:55:28] ever now and
[2:55:30] then I feel a little tug on the other
[2:55:32] end of the
[2:55:34] line come on
[2:55:36] church every now and then not all the
[2:55:38] time not every time I want to not every
[2:55:41] time I think I need to we don't live by
[2:55:43] feelings if we felt him every time we
[2:55:45] wanted to feel him or thought we should
[2:55:47] feel him we'd get
[2:55:49] spoiled and we wouldn't live by faith
[2:55:51] we'd live by feeling and feeling can
[2:55:53] fool you but faith will perfect you
[2:55:57] there's a difference so you won't always
[2:55:59] see him but you'll know he's there right
[2:56:03] because from time to time you'll feel
[2:56:05] that tug on the other end of the line
[2:56:08] reminding you there's somebody on the
[2:56:10] other end of this
[2:56:11] Lifeline who can fix it he can fix it if
[2:56:15] you've let your camp meeting Victory
[2:56:17] fade
[2:56:20] 30 days
[2:56:21] out you can find it again
[2:56:23] tonight if you have sat in this church
[2:56:26] or stood in this church week after week
[2:56:28] after week feeling disconnected I am not
[2:56:31] in any way trying to condemn you or
[2:56:34] Shrink the way that you have felt I just
[2:56:36] need you to know your
[2:56:38] answer is in your
[2:56:42] hand it's in your hand we'll stand with
[2:56:45] you we'll we'll bring our faith with you
[2:56:47] we'll pray with with you but the answer
[2:56:50] does not dep does not depend on your
[2:56:52] pastor or your family or your church
[2:56:55] family your answer depends on
[2:57:00] you in order to hold on to the lifeline
[2:57:03] you're going to have to turn your back
[2:57:06] on the
[2:57:07] past don't look at the winds or the
[2:57:11] waves I thought this thing will never
[2:57:13] save anybody they'll grab a hold of this
[2:57:16] it'll be brittle it'll fall apart in
[2:57:18] their
[2:57:18] hands but it wasn't what I thought it
[2:57:21] was it was way more than it
[2:57:24] looked oh tell them tell them tell them
[2:57:27] every one of them make it they can all
[2:57:28] make it if they'll hold on to John 15
[2:57:32] hold on to the John 15 Lifeline that's
[2:57:35] what I've come to tell you
[2:57:37] tonight I I I want you to make every
[2:57:40] effort to make up your mind to do
[2:57:43] it we're going to just give you an
