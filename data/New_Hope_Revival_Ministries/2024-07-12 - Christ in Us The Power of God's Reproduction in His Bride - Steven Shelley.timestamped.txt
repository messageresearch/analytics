[0:00] you can't know the fatherly aspect of
[0:03] God unless it is revealed to you by the
[0:06] son Nobody Knows the father like the son
[0:10] and nobody knows the son like the father
[0:14] and when we have the Son of God he
[0:17] reveals to us the nature and the
[0:20] character of the Father which is
[0:23] sometimes uh in our human way of
[0:26] thinking uh a little regiment or a
[0:30] little rigid but I want you to know the
[0:33] Father's Love For Us is so
[0:36] great that he has paid the ultimate
[0:40] sacrifice he became the son he stepped
[0:44] down into a condescended form died on
[0:48] the cross securing eternal life for us
[0:52] does that sound like somebody who hates
[0:54] you does that sound like somebody who
[0:56] wants to crush you to powder no it
[0:58] sounds like somebody who loves
[1:01] us and loved us with such a love that he
[1:06] came up with a masterful
[1:09] plan that he might be able to win us and
[1:13] to redeem us oh what a blessed people we
[1:17] are redeemed of the Lord for such an
[1:21] hour as this to know that the son is
[1:25] revealing the father that the bridegroom
[1:28] is revealing to the bride the very
[1:31] nature of the Creator the glory of
[1:34] knowing that we are the the reproduced
[1:39] Christ in the earth I tell you that's a
[1:42] powerful thing to know that God has
[1:47] reproduced himself in the life of his
[1:51] sons
[1:53] powerful somebody said that may be too
[1:55] big of a description is it if the very
[2:00] life of God is in you if the very Spirit
[2:05] and the fullness of who Jesus Christ is
[2:09] and was has been now emptied into the
[2:13] bride is it really so much to say that
[2:17] he has reproduced himself in a multi
[2:21] membered body in a many-membered bride I
[2:24] don't think it's so very much at all I
[2:26] think it's a logical understanding we
[2:29] know that Christ is the mystery of God
[2:34] revealed and that
[2:36] demands that demands that the bride be
[2:41] the mystery of Christ revealed if it was
[2:45] the responsibility of the son to reveal
[2:49] the father it is now the wife's
[2:53] responsibility to reveal the bridegroom
