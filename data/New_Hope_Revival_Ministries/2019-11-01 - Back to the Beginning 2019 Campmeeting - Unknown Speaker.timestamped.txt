[0:17] did we ever get a gully washer sister
[0:22] Evelyn did it rain all the way from
[0:23] North Carolina here it really rained
[0:28] when we were driving back after lunch
[0:32] and you know the water was rushing
[0:35] across the road and people were just
[0:37] driving too fast
[0:38] and I was one of them and I said hey
[0:41] I've got to slow down and because I was
[0:44] about ready to drop my wife off and I
[0:46] knew she'd be driving I didn't want her
[0:48] to follow my example we're not used to
[0:51] we're not used to that much water it's
[0:53] been a while since it's come like that I
[0:55] was walking through the church this
[0:57] afternoon just talking to the Lord and I
[1:00] really felt impressed that it was a sign
[1:04] for us we take it we can take it we're
[1:07] not trying to be weird but we need a
[1:10] real cleansing and a real washing
[1:12] I'm thankful it's not snow we need a
[1:17] real washing we have come through a
[1:19] summer that that was wonderful
[1:22] in the natural the weather was good and
[1:25] the rain was good until all of a sudden
[1:28] it was not and it got dry didn't it and
[1:31] it got really dry and even shrubbery
[1:34] started dying and it was a drought and
[1:38] it was declared a drought but I just
[1:40] felt like the Lord was saying for those
[1:42] of us who can believe the the drought is
[1:45] over amen and we'll take that
[1:48] spiritually because maybe you've been in
[1:52] a dry season and you don't have to be
[1:54] there and I just felt like the Lord
[1:56] wanted to use this week to just wash
[1:59] away just residue what whatever we might
[2:03] carry that's just not gonna not gonna go
[2:06] with us and it's not gonna promote the
[2:09] kingdom of God in us or through us so
[2:12] you know the Lord is just sovereign and
[2:15] on the weekend we didn't know for sure
[2:17] that brother Darren and sister Rebecca
[2:19] would get to be here tonight we knew
[2:21] they would come but her grandmother was
[2:23] just hanging on and still is she wasn't
[2:26] supposed to make it through Thursday
[2:28] night I think
[2:29] was and then they said not through the
[2:31] weekend and the Lord just nudged them to
[2:34] Cohen they got here about midnight last
[2:36] night they did that for us I appreciate

[2:49] and tell somebody else and bring
[2:51] somebody else but we as a church body we
[2:54] need this week we need this season and

[16:00] truth tonight amen if you have your
[16:02] Bibles tonight we'll turn over to first
[16:05] John chapter 2
[16:19] God has done done a lot of things forced
[16:24] to be able to be here tonight
[16:26] Steve kind of lets you aware of some of
[16:28] the things that's going on or sister
[16:30] Rebecca my wife her grandmother is is
[16:33] close to passing on and then we're
[16:38] looking forward to for her cross over
[16:41] she's a elderly lady in their 80s and
[16:44] she deserves to be going on over and but
[16:48] the Lord has just held it off for a few
[16:50] days I believe for us to be able to be
[16:52] here with you I didn't want to come out
[16:54] without my wife and I think God that
[16:56] he's he's blended all out we didn't know
[16:59] what to do and I just told her I said
[17:02] well I'm gonna pray in the morning and
[17:04] and and I'm gonna I believe the Lord is
[17:06] going to give us an answer so I picked
[17:08] up my Bible and prayed that morning and
[17:10] and I read over in the Old Testament
[17:12] read in Psalms and read in the New
[17:14] Testament and everything I read was life
[17:17] and everything I read was go and I
[17:21] thought all right yes that's enough for
[17:23] me to tell her to go with me he meant so
[17:26] I and it looks like that's what perfect
[17:29] what God has done for us so we're and
[17:31] and then you praying from our mother I
[17:34] appreciate you doing that she's come a
[17:37] long ways in the last four days that God
[17:39] has done great things for her it's just
[17:41] a complete turnaround and where she was
[17:44] having needing help through the night
[17:46] getting up and and and and sitting down
[17:49] and just in screaming and agony of pain
[17:51] trying to get out of the seat but God
[17:54] has turned that around that she can do
[17:56] it by herself now amen and the Lord has
[17:59] just done amazing work in the last three
[18:02] or four days and and it relieved me to
[18:05] be able to come so I you know I don't
[18:08] know what's going on in your life for
[18:10] these meetings is what no what the
[18:11] devil's trying to do but you know the
[18:13] devil wouldn't try to do something we
[18:14] Feeny thought something wasn't good
[18:17] gonna happen amen but we're here to
[18:19] block the eye of the devil tonight amen
[18:22] and we're expecting first John chapter
[18:26] two
[18:32] like to start at verse 24 let that
[18:40] therefore abide in you which ye have
[18:45] heard from the beginning if that which
[18:50] you have heard from the beginning shall
[18:53] remain in you you also shall continue in
[18:58] the Son and in the father and this is
[19:02] the promise that he hath promised us
[19:05] even eternal life these things have I
[19:09] written unto you concerning them that
[19:11] seduce you but denying what you have
[19:14] received of him abideth in you and you
[19:19] need not that any man teach you but as
[19:21] the same anointing teaches you of all
[19:24] things and is truth and is no lie and
[19:27] even as it hath taught you ye shall
[19:30] abide in him and now little children
[19:33] abide in him that when he shall appear
[19:37] we may have what confidence and not be
[19:42] ashamed before him at his coming if we
[19:45] know that he is righteous you know that
[19:47] everyone that doeth righteousness is
[19:49] born of him a man I hope that stirs your
[19:52] heart here tonight we're just gonna
[19:54] believe this is where the Lord allow us
[19:56] to be father we come to you again Lord
[19:59] after the reading of your word now
[20:00] inspire our hearts to take this Lord and
[20:03] pray God that you would anoint and
[20:05] magnify - ass Lord and express to the
[20:09] earth Lord here tonight your faults
[20:11] Levis have tonight the mind that was in
[20:14] Christ Lord that our being us Lord and
[20:16] now pray God to childress stores
[20:18] everything Lord that the devil has tried
[20:21] to take away nor that we would Lord
[20:23] believe here tonight with all confidence
[20:26] Lord Jesus that were ready for a rapture
[20:29] that we're ready Lord at anytime to
[20:31] speak the word and it shall come to pass
[20:33] father troubles all around Lord
[20:36] different things has taking place all
[20:38] hell is against us but there's no weapon
[20:40] formed against us shop
[20:42] prosper Lord Father we believe Lord that
[20:45] you have cursed the devil father and we
[20:47] know that Lord we are Lord on the side
[20:50] of the righteous Lord you've blessed us
[20:52] Lord and we pray God that you just
[20:54] continued Lord to help us to grow in the
[20:56] manifestations of the sons of God giving
[20:59] you glory and praised here tonight in
[21:01] Jesus Christ's name Amen god bless you
[21:04] can be seated amen
[21:06] looking at that then the scripture there
[21:09] let that therefore abide in you which
[21:12] you have heard from where the beginning
[21:16] a man I believe that we can be
[21:18] identified with those scriptures here
[21:20] tonight because we have a message that
[21:23] has took us back to the beginning amen
[21:26] is not took us to traditions of man it's
[21:30] not took us back to Creed's to things
[21:32] that has has no meaning but we have a
[21:36] prophet a seer born the prophet a seer
[21:39] that has took us back amen it can go
[21:42] forward into the future and they can go
[21:45] back amen as far as God would allow him
[21:48] to go back is that right Amos 3:7 says
[21:51] I'll do nothing except I reveal it
[21:53] through my servants the prophets amen
[21:56] and that means nothing amen and so we
[21:58] got something here tonight because God
[22:00] has told us is that right amen and he
[22:03] says let that therefore abide in you
[22:05] which you have heard from the beginning
[22:07] and he says if that which you have heard
[22:09] from the beginning shall remain in you
[22:11] you also shall continue in the Son and
[22:14] in the father and and so we want to
[22:17] think about I've been in a series of
[22:19] preaching they're at their place they're
[22:23] in Tennessee and it's just been a
[22:24] burning in our heart amen and so we're
[22:27] looking 'men some messages on marriage
[22:32] and different things for the young
[22:33] people and you know just looking at the
[22:37] what the prophet of God says teach your
[22:38] children to teach their children to
[22:40] teach their children and so is looking
[22:43] at those things and then God just
[22:44] reveals something to us and then it
[22:46] began to sit like that roman candle
[22:48] began to just explode and explode and
[22:50] explode and you know the prophet of god
[22:53] seen things that he says the bible
[22:55] became a
[22:55] you book to him a man I believe when we
[22:58] see a revelation brothers sisters it
[23:00] stirs our heart Amen it stirs our soul
[23:03] it's stimulation of the revelation and
[23:06] it just you know the scriptures
[23:08] dovetails with each other but you know
[23:11] when we see something we can take it
[23:12] back to the beginning and it should flow
[23:15] all the way through and I love it when
[23:17] it happens amen it just stirs our heart
[23:20] amen and it stirs a revival back down in
[23:22] her soul and so I was looking at that
[23:25] and and we was thinking about if we
[23:27] could just take our minds back in the
[23:29] Garden of Eden and we could think about
[23:31] Amen that first man Adam my we could
[23:35] just we could just talk all night about
[23:37] Adam and and think about where we're at
[23:40] where he was that in that Garden of Eden
[23:42] and if we could just think about where
[23:44] he started off that he didn't start off
[23:46] as a little baby a man he started off
[23:49] amen like a tree a man a grown tree his
[23:53] feet was planted into the garden and
[23:56] into the dirt and there and you know he
[23:58] stood there as a as a grown mature son
[24:02] of God is that right in the image of God
[24:04] and we think about how he was standing
[24:07] there and and God spoke life into him is
[24:10] that right and it became a living soul
[24:12] and we could just think about Adam oh my
[24:16] amen to all the great things that was
[24:18] taking place amen in the garden of this
[24:21] first man Adam was a man when he became
[24:23] he never was a baby he was created is
[24:28] that right he didn't even have a birth
[24:29] he didn't have a navel amen and so we
[24:33] think about he was spoken there he was
[24:36] he came as a spoken word is that right
[24:39] amen he was made in the likeness of God
[24:42] amen and we think about there was no
[24:45] nature of sin in him totally different
[24:49] from us
[24:50] there was no nature of sin in him amen
[24:54] no genes was passed to him as far as
[24:57] says it's the genes of sin that was
[25:01] passed down to him there was no
[25:03] knowledge of evil in him is that right
[25:07] Amen there was no knowledge of evil
[25:10] there was no memory handed to Tim that
[25:13] was of a bad memory all brothers and
[25:16] sisters could you think about if we
[25:18] could have right here tonight no memory
[25:21] that was handed to us Amen of our
[25:24] grandfathers what wrong that they done
[25:26] Oh a sin that they've done the property
[25:28] God says my grandfather's died with her
[25:30] boot song
[25:31] amen to through the sin and ancestors
[25:33] that was handed down to us and would
[25:35] Jean it down to this you know maybe
[25:37] alcoholic or or drugs or different
[25:40] things and and so there was none of that
[25:43] knowledge of evil no memory handed down
[25:45] to him amen
[25:47] we just think about he never cried for
[25:49] Annie as a baby would have to cry
[25:52] because it needs something it never hurt
[25:54] for pain as a child would from a boo-boo
[25:57] no thoughts of evil
[25:59] Ament Adam had no thoughts of evil
[26:03] praising oh I could trade with him right
[26:06] now what you a man I'm talking about in
[26:09] the beginning let's go back to the
[26:11] beginning in that garden Eden where Adam
[26:13] was he had no memory of sin no nature in

[28:24] we're at praise the Lord I believe Adam
[28:30] was in that place amen he and he was
[28:33] only positive he was no hurry raised the
[28:40] Lord he was in no hurry

[29:33] peaceful it was beautiful
[29:36] there was expectation all the time it
[29:40] was supernatural there was nothing but
[29:44] love everywhere
[29:47] praise the Lord love unity everything in
[29:52] one Accord the animals were in love the
[29:55] trees were in love everything around him
[29:57] was love raised the Lord Amen you know
[30:02] you can go into the cities and it's
[30:03] totally different but you get way up in
[30:05] the woods and into the country there
[30:07] ain't many and you just feel the peace
[30:09] that's in there that's because man's got
[30:13] to do with the cities but man ain't got
[30:15] nothing to do back in the mountains
[30:17] there were suta phul yeah right
[30:19] and it was love a man why was it was
[30:22] because Adam was a son to God is that
[30:25] right Adam knew who his father was
[30:28] Adam knew who he was Adam talked to God
[30:33] and God talked to Adam every day and
[30:36] Adam knew his position is that right
[30:39] amen and his position was to dress and
[30:42] keep the garden and he was fine with
[30:45] that
[30:45] right and Adam gave authority to the
[30:49] garden because God says this is your
[30:51] earth and he had authority over
[30:54] everything that was taking place he had
[30:57] authority with love he can speak to the
[31:00] wind with love not in a hurry not this
[31:03] not in an anxiety not were scared
[31:08] a man in authority with love praise the
[31:12] Lord Amen you know and it's so
[31:16] he could speak to the trees and we can
[31:19] say hey man he could do that he could
[31:21] speak to the animals a man he could
[31:23] speak to the wind a man and the God
[31:25] liked Adam giving control God like him
[31:30] taking his position and doing what he
[31:32] was called to do hey man he was having
[31:36] dominion and God and Adam was in accord
[31:39] one Accord in lightness oneness agree oh
[31:43] I mean I would just like to know that
[31:46] God was pleased with me every step that
[31:48] I took every choice that I made
[31:51] it was happy about it Amen every time I
[31:54] make a decision he say yes that's
[31:56] exactly right that's exactly what I
[31:58] thought when Adam named those animals
[32:01] that's gonna be aligned God says yes
[32:03] that's exactly what I thought that's
[32:05] gonna be a monkey yes that's exactly
[32:07] what row just riding the cord with God
[32:11] wouldn't you like to have one week like
[32:14] that that God is happy with everything
[32:17] you do hey man praise the Lord and you
[32:22] not have one work not one thought that
[32:25] God was displeased with what you done
[32:30] you know and so we look at that that's
[32:33] what it was in the beginning that's what
[32:38] it was in the beginning
[32:39] praise the Lord Amen I'd like for you to
[32:44] turn over to Matthew chapter 19 with me
[32:49] just a moment
[33:03] we're going up to Jesus's day here
[33:18] verse 1 and it came to pass that when
[33:21] Jesus had finished these sayings he
[33:23] departed from Galilee and came into the
[33:25] coasts of Judea beyond Jordan and great
[33:28] multitudes followed him in heel he
[33:30] healed them there
[33:31] the Pharisees also came unto Him
[33:33] tempting him and saying unto them is it
[33:36] lawful for a man to put away his wife
[33:38] for every cause and he answered and said
[33:41] to them have you not read that he which
[33:45] made them at work made them male and
[33:51] female and said for this cause shall a
[33:55] man leave father and mother shall cleave
[33:58] to his wife and they twain shall be one
[34:01] flesh wherefore they are no more Twain
[34:05] but one flesh what therefore God hath
[34:07] joined together let not man put asunder
[34:09] and they say unto him why did Moses then
[34:13] command to give a writing of divorcement
[34:14] and to put her away and he said to them
[34:17] Moses because of the hardness of your
[34:21] hearts suffered you to put away your
[34:23] wives but from the beginning it was not
[34:28] so let those things that you have heard
[34:33] from the beginning remain in you
[34:37] you see I'm taking you back to the
[34:40] beginning and see where everything was
[34:43] in its rightful position is that right
[34:46] amen and then we see all that that took
[34:49] place in the gardening it took Adam and
[34:51] Eve from the rightful position I can
[34:55] imagine as they was leaving that garden
[34:57] Amen hallelujah they had never seen a
[35:00] lamb slain before they had never seen a
[35:02] life died in front of them but when God
[35:05] took that first lamb and took a rock and
[35:07] cut that glams throat and they was
[35:10] saying death for the first time I'm sure
[35:13] it was a different thought than they've
[35:16] ever had it was all love it was all
[35:19] peace it was all just grace and mercy
[35:22] amen and just wonderful but here they
[35:25] seen a lamb dying he meant because they
[35:29] know the feeling
[35:31] messed up we've done wrong they got that
[35:35] feeling for the first time is that right
[35:38] amen and now they're having to see life
[35:40] leave a man their blood everywhere
[35:43] they've never seen blood because there
[35:45] was no you know nothing taking place
[35:47] like that but now something has happened
[35:50] and the prophet of God says and I can
[35:52] see Adam and Eve leaving the garden now
[35:54] amen with the lens of such skin slapping
[35:57] them on the back in the road and running
[35:59] down and Adam and growth there's a wife
[36:01] going out of the garden Oh what have we
[36:03] done how we've messed up Oh God amen
[36:09] they're having to leave that garden God
[36:12] is now amen driving them out of that
[36:15] place is that right
[36:17] amen and he has to put a flaming sword
[36:20] there to keep them from going back to
[36:21] that tree of life is that right because
[36:24] now they've tasted the tree of good and
[36:26] evil now they know what was good and now
[36:30] they know what is evil and now they're
[36:32] in between good and evil and that's
[36:34] where we're at today we're stuck between
[36:36] that good and evil and we're we're
[36:38] pulling our mind and we're saying oh god
[36:41] I can't stand this I can't handle this I
[36:44] need something that'll bring me back to
[36:46] that original creation back to that
[36:49] original word back to the original place
[36:52] with God a me that I could get partly
[36:54] away from this negative thing I could
[36:56] get turn away from anything that would
[36:59] be displeasing the gone hey man we're
[37:02] crying aim it for another step to take
[37:06] us back to that place is that right
[37:08] Adam and Eve always wanted to get back
[37:10] in there hey man praise the Lord and now
[37:15] we say Jesus is in in his day is that
[37:18] right you know
[37:25] I don't know I didn't know what the Lord
[37:28] was wanting me to preach here tonight
[37:31] well that's alright we're just gonna go
[37:34] step by step you know if you would read
[37:41] the janata G of Adam he doesn't keep up
[37:46] with Cain is their high because he
[37:53] wasn't interested in the Cain seat
[37:56] because that was that was the other seat
[37:59] that got planting inside there is that
[38:01] right but he keeps up with the sons of
[38:04] God is that right and we know that Adam
[38:08] lived 930 years and so Adam lived 930
[38:13] years he gets to see a lot of
[38:14] generations coming for I mean he gets a
[38:19] seat Seth come from Comfort come and
[38:22] then he gets to see in us and then
[38:25] Canaan and then mahalia and Jared and
[38:28] Enoch and Methuselah and layman eight
[38:33] generations that he gets to see come to
[38:35] pass and I was thinking about this other
[38:39] day and and it says there when I got
[38:42] down to Enoch because they've got a
[38:43] revelation of who Enoch was and I got I
[38:46] see in the scriptures what he not got to
[38:48] do is that right and I think about all
[38:51] these children of this man of Adam and I
[38:57] thought did they know who their grandpa
[38:59] was was they interested in who he was
[39:07] did they read enough of the testimonies
[39:12] or whatever they had in that day to go
[39:14] back and and be interested in their
[39:16] daddy but I get up to Enoch and I look
[39:18] at his life and I think well here is
[39:21] Enoch and in and as I figured I'm not
[39:24] too good of a mathematic but did what I
[39:27] looked at in the Bible there I figured
[39:30] out Adam is 602 years old when Enoch is
[39:33] born I'm gonna tell you I may be a
[39:37] little wrong in this
[39:38] but as I configure he was six hundred
[39:40] two years old when Enoch is born Enoch
[39:43] is 65 years old when he has a son
[39:45] Methuselah and Adam is now six hundred
[39:48] sixty-seven years old
[39:49] amen and Methuselah is the seventh
[39:52] generation Adam is getting to see so
[39:57] Adam is 854 years old and gets to see
[39:59] eight generations and he dies when he's
[40:03] 930 years old and so I'm thinking about
[40:07] here's this Enoch coming along and Enoch
[40:11] is walking with God and I think about
[40:14] that and I thought you know it's amazing
[40:17] how you know if there's a seed in there
[40:20] it's it's it's a calling out there's a
[40:23] deep calling to the deep is there I mean
[40:26] I'm thinking that Enoch here he's a
[40:29] great great great great grandson and he
[40:33] can walk down here - great great great
[40:34] great great great Grandpa's house a man
[40:37] is set down in grandpa's living room and
[40:40] say what was it like in the beginning
[40:46] Amon as I can understand you was the
[40:49] first man on the earth what was it like
[40:53] in that place in the garden Eden where
[40:55] there was nothing negative everything
[40:57] was positive everything was beautiful
[41:00] everything was perfect
[41:03] and Adam could sit there and tell him
[41:06] what it was in the beginning and
[41:11] everything that Enoch would say I mean
[41:13] Adam will tell Enoch it was remaining in
[41:16] him he could not forget all the little
[41:20] other little grandsons and the boys he
[41:22] men were over there playing with her
[41:24] toys or something but something about
[41:25] that was in Enoch he was interested in
[41:28] what happened in the beginning I hope
[41:31] we're sitting here here tonight we're
[41:33] interested what happened in the
[41:35] beginning because it has not left my
[41:37] mind because I'm going to get back to
[41:40] what it was like that praise the Lord
[41:42] I'm interested there's something says
[41:44] amen
[41:45] I want to know I want to taste
[41:47] I want to get back to where that was
[41:49] bracelet or a Men hallelujah
[41:52] and so Enoch here's all the Adams
[41:54] talking about all of this how it was in
[41:58] the garden
[41:58] Enochs heart is stirred by hearing the
[42:01] richness of hearing the original man in
[42:04] the beginning he wants to hear more
[42:05] about the beginning more of that
[42:08] original more of that spoken word more
[42:11] about the thought authority he had more
[42:14] of that oneness he had with his wife in
[42:17] the beginning more of that oneness he
[42:19] had with God that everyday fellowship
[42:21] that he had and he was a Adam can you
[42:24] tell me some more is there something
[42:26] else you can tell me about him I can't
[42:30] you remember anything else
[42:34] he not hears that Adam passes on one
[42:38] morning and Enoch goes down there at the
[42:43] borough mourning over Adams is gone he
[42:48] knocked his sister by all that he has
[42:51] heard what was in the garden of that
[42:53] fellowship and Enoch a man was we
[42:57] understanding he takes what he hears the
[43:00] message that he's wrote down a man he
[43:02] takes it home with him and he begins to
[43:06] build something church we're building
[43:09] stone upon stone revelation of on
[43:12] revelation
[43:13] Enoch built that pyramid which was God's
[43:16] Amen second Bible as we understand by
[43:19] the message of the hour and that pyramid
[43:21] was stone upon stone
[43:23] I believe Enoch was getting revelation
[43:26] upon revelation and he didn't just leave
[43:28] it at church brother he was so
[43:30] interested he was so Amen that's
[43:32] elevated in what Adam was talking to him
[43:35] about a man he brought it home and he
[43:37] began to put one upon the other and one
[43:40] upon the other Amen before you know it
[43:42] he was building a masterpiece that God
[43:45] was saved that's my Bible that's my word
[43:48] is that right amen he would take it and
[43:51] place it Amen one stone upon a stone and
[43:54] the Bible says he walked with God
[43:56] II know whoa
[43:58] with God every day he walked with God he
[44:01] took what we he was hearing from the
[44:02] beginning and he began to desire in his
[44:05] life that fellowship
[44:07] is that right amen and he said the Bible
[44:11] says he walk with God every day he
[44:14] waited like Adam did till God came and
[44:16] they took a walk together is that right
[44:19] one day men as he got that a pyramid
[44:22] built up to so high Amen in any slant
[44:25] thinking that home
[44:26] Oh Lord amen I'm just about finished
[44:28] with this thing I mean I just about got
[44:30] it completed a man in God says he said
[44:33] but God I need your help today
[44:36] I don't know what else to do here and
[44:38] then God says that's alright I'm coming
[44:41] I'm coming and he says it's time for the
[44:44] capstone it's time for this cap off I'm
[44:47] at the top Lord what are you going to do
[44:49] for me
[44:49] God can I just have another revelation
[44:51] God says you're gonna get or give
[44:53] revelation today
[44:54] I mean God comes down Amen in the Adam
[44:57] talks walks out these door and he kisses
[44:59] his wife and his children amen how
[45:01] little it begins the walk God comes down
[45:03] that day a meaning he begins to walk was
[45:06] God
[45:06] aiming down to that pyramid and all of a
[45:09] sudden the capstone came down and took
[45:11] him home
[45:11] oh praise the Lord it was why he knock
[45:15] was here from the beginning that took
[45:17] him it with a walk with God that took
[45:19] him out of here
[45:22] I'm thinking if that power of that word
[45:25] Amen if we can hear from the beginning
[45:28] could we be like a Enoch that it'll take
[45:31] us and we'll walk a life they eat not
[45:33] lived Amy we'll walk with God will build
[45:35] stone upon stone revelation upon
[45:38] revelation Amen in one day we'll be not
[45:41] because God took us howl if it's a car
[45:45] wreck or whatever it is God took us hey
[45:49] man raise the Lord it stirs my heart him
[45:54] man he's Lord
[46:00] let's go years.they later down the road
[46:03] and here comes a second Adam here comes
[46:10] a second Adam and he didn't come like
[46:13] the first Adam he come at a baby why huh
[46:20] come as a baby praise the Lord this is
[46:24] God's choice this is God's character
[46:29] this is how God chose to come in the
[46:33] second Adam was that right hey man and
[46:36] how did he choose when he's gonna be
[46:39] born he didn't choose a hospital he
[46:42] didn't choose a beautiful place
[46:44] he chose a manure pile
[46:50] he chose a stable is that right I mean
[46:56] he didn't choose all the beauty this is
[46:59] his character I'm coming this way and
[47:02] when it comes he comes forth as a baby
[47:05] in the manger and the Bible says and he
[47:08] had no word to lay his head
[47:10] is that right amen and we see that here
[47:14] he is Amen in he's uh he had a bar he
[47:17] had a bar a womb to come in he had a bar
[47:22] e as stable is that right
[47:25] amen and then we see here that is found
[47:28] at 12 years old he's in the temple
[47:31] talking to teachers hey man is that
[47:34] right
[47:35] talking to grown men that knows the
[47:37] Bible from the beginning to the end and
[47:39] here he is 12 years old and he's telling
[47:42] them things that's blowing their mind
[47:46] because this man has been getting in the
[47:48] beginning this man just didn't show up
[47:51] because he was born in Nazareth or born
[47:53] in in a place in a stable this man had
[47:56] walked in the beginning he knew who that
[47:58] first Adam was God could talk us and
[48:01] take those men back to the beginning and
[48:03] there are less women they've never heard
[48:05] these things how does this young boy at
[48:07] 12 years old know these things
[48:10] oh ma raise the Lord and the Bible says
[48:17] here he goes and he goes out through
[48:19] Galilee he's teaching in their
[48:22] synagogues he's preaching the gospel of
[48:24] the kingdom and here he goes forth and
[48:27] he's healing all manner of sickness and
[48:30] all manner diseases among the people was
[48:34] their high amen
[48:37] and his fame went throughout all Syria
[48:40] Syria and they brought unto him all sick
[48:42] people that were taken with divers
[48:44] diseases and torments and those which
[48:46] were possessed with devils and those
[48:48] that were lunatic and those that had the
[48:50] policy and it says and He healed them
[48:52] all praise the Lord
[48:56] here's the second Adam a man and was his
[49:00] desire what is his character to bring
[49:02] man and restore him back to their health
[49:06] bring them back to their healthy bodies
[49:09] that that was lost from there's that
[49:12] right a man they lost their health they
[49:15] lost their eyesight they lost their
[49:17] their to a healthy body to be able to
[49:19] walk and hear Christ that second Adam is
[49:21] coming in and he's restoring them back
[49:23] into their healthy bodies he's restored
[49:27] them back to the right mind and their
[49:29] memory of what he had here he comes upon
[49:32] a blind man and the disciple says well
[49:34] law has made this man blind was that his
[49:37] mother or his father he said nothing
[49:39] made his mind none of that
[49:41] Amy but for the glory of today that I
[49:44] have come to heal his body it was born
[49:48] for our purpose being blind so that man
[49:52] Jesus could come by and heal him today I

[53:38] something in this hour that'll take us
[53:40] to the beginning it'll take us all the
[53:42] way to the very high low life that was
[53:44] in the beginning hallelujah
[53:49] here is becomes before a Centurion and
[53:57] the Centurions gotta I believe is a
[54:00] child and he says Lord I'm not worthy
[54:04] that thou should has come under my roof
[54:07] but Speak the word only in my service
[54:08] shall be healed so it's a servant see
[54:12] for I'm a man under Authority
[54:13] soldiers on me and I say to this man go
[54:15] and he goeth and to another come and he
[54:18] cometh and to some dry servant do this
[54:20] and he do with it and when Jesus heard
[54:24] that he marveled and said to them that
[54:28] followed very us and hew I have not
[54:30] found so great faith no not in Israel
[54:35] and I say unto you that many shall come
[54:37] from the east and west and shall sit
[54:38] down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in
[54:40] the kingdom of heaven but the children
[54:42] of the kingdom shall be cast out into
[54:43] outer darkness there shall be weeping
[54:45] gnashing of teeth and Jesus said unto
[54:47] the Centurion look the power look to the
[54:51] authority go thy way and as thou has to
[54:55] believe so be it done unto thee and his
[54:59] servant was healed in the self-same our
[55:03] praise Lord this is that second Adam the
[55:08] first Adam forfeit the book he forfeit
[55:12] the rights is that right he forfeit Amen
[55:16] that book of life and he lost that to
[55:20] eat of the tree of good of good and evil
[55:23] there right amen
[55:25] but here comes the second Adam amen and
[55:28] he's eating the tree of life amen and
[55:30] he's speaking two things and it's coming
[55:32] to pass oh is that right a man and when
[55:36] Jesus comes into Peter's house he saw
[55:38] his wife's mother laid sick of a fever
[55:40] and he touched her hand and the fever
[55:42] left her at that moment and she arrives
[55:45] and ministered unto him when the evening
[55:47] was come they brought in too many that
[55:49] were possessed with Devils cast out the
[55:51] spirits with his word and he healed all
[55:53] that were sick that it might be
[55:54] fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the
[55:56] prophet saying he himself took our
[55:58] infirmities and by our sickness Jesus
[56:03] has not only restoring health back to
[56:05] certain ones that would believe but he
[56:07] is restoring the promises of God back to
[56:10] the true believers God is a restorer
[56:15] that I come to restore us back to the
[56:20] Tree of Life
[56:22] Adam had a walkout there was a sword to
[56:24] God to guard them from that tree life
[56:26] but this adam says get back to it
[56:29] praise the Lord he meant he says there
[56:33] used to be a time that people could go
[56:35] behind the veil where the Shekinah glory
[56:37] is it was death is that right but he
[56:40] says but now it's a time that if you
[56:42] don't go back there it's dead it's
[56:45] spiritual death now God is saying I want
[56:47] you back eating that tree of life is
[56:50] that right
[56:51] praise the Lord Churchill is the second
[56:55] Adam he's the Tree of Life is that right
[57:00] he was in the garden and they couldn't
[57:03] touch him no more they couldn't go in
[57:05] there and touchy but now here's the tree
[57:08] of life walking around and he said touch
[57:10] me they have the ability to touch him
[57:15] they have the ability to top Platoon
[57:17] they had the ability to love him and
[57:19] they're calling him a belzebub a meaning
[57:22] they're calling this and that but they
[57:24] don't realize he's the tree of life oh
[57:26] they just realize he's the tree of life
[57:29] they can have that peace with God again
[57:32] they can be restored back to like Adam
[57:35] was but they didn't have the revelation
[57:39] like Enoch handy is that right
[57:43] a man hope this is okay and so here he
[57:50] comes up to some of these Pharisees and
[57:54] Sadducees and they come up to him now
[57:58] watch Jesus and they says Moses give us
[58:02] a law that we could do this there that
[58:06] we could put them on I don't put our
[58:08] wives away for any cost and Jesus says
[58:14] it was because of the hardness of your
[58:16] heart he had to put up with two million
[58:21] people by himself
[58:25] right full of complaints full of
[58:29] negativity full of all kinds of
[58:32] murmuring amen hallelujah and he just
[58:35] couldn't handle and God allowed him to
[58:38] do that but watch Jesus does he let him
[58:42] keep going in Moses's word and what
[58:45] Moses let him do he says it wasn't so
[58:48] from the beginning he's gone taking this
[58:53] back to what was in the beginning he's
[58:57] taking us back to what a true marriage
[59:00] was in the beginning is that right amen
[59:05] let's turn over to Genesis for just a
[59:07] second I'm not getting in the marriage
[59:10] of divorce I'm just getting you into
[59:12] amen the the of the truth in the
[59:15] beginning Genesis 5 let's look at this
[59:18] know Genesis 2 verse 21 and the Lord God
[59:34] caused a deep sleep to fall upon who and
[59:38] he slept and he took one of his ribs and
[59:41] closed up the flesh instead thereof and
[59:44] the rib which the Lord God had taken
[59:46] from man made he a woman and brought her
[59:49] unto the man she came were from him she
[59:56] was in him and Adam said listen who said
[1:00:00] it Adam this is now bone of my bones
[1:00:04] flesh of my flesh she shall be called
[1:00:07] woman this is Adam talking because she
[1:00:10] was taken out of man right now verse 24
[1:00:14] therefore shall a man leave his father
[1:00:17] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[1:00:19] wife that shall be one flesh this is not
[1:00:22] Adam talking Adam new wall had taken
[1:00:29] place and he says this is now bone of my
[1:00:31] bones flesh in my flesh but when he gets
[1:00:33] to verse 24 who's writing the book of
[1:00:35] Genesis Moses under the inspiration of
[1:00:39] the
[1:00:39] holy ghosts and when it gets the first
[1:00:41] 24 and it says Moses is riding here
[1:00:44] therefore shall a man leave his father
[1:00:46] and his wife Adam didn't have a mother
[1:00:51] he didn't have to leave his mama's house
[1:00:55] he didn't have a mommy that give him
[1:00:57] birth that right this was God's Way of
[1:01:04] marriage in the beginning is that right
[1:01:07] for us knowing ahead what was going to
[1:01:10] do knowing ahead of what future marriage
[1:01:12] was so God's putting something in there
[1:01:14] what a man should do when he marries a
[1:01:16] woman and he says therefore shall a man
[1:01:19] leave his father and his mother and
[1:01:20] cleave unto who his wife his wife and
[1:01:26] they shall be what one flesh and they
[1:01:30] were in the new system but they're both
[1:01:32] naked man and his wife were not ashamed
[1:01:34] but so he says but they were one flesh
[1:01:36] this is what Jesus said was not so in
[1:01:40] the beginning this is what Jesus is
[1:01:42] referring to this is the original word
[1:01:45] this is the original marriage that this
[1:01:48] is his wife Adams wife and they were one
[1:01:52] together she came out of him he's trying
[1:01:56] to restore them back to what a real
[1:01:59] marriage was that you don't just put
[1:02:00] away your wives they're part of you I'm
[1:02:05] glad God won't put away his wife they
[1:02:08] mean that he's part of us Adam walked
[1:02:11] into there and saved his wife with his
[1:02:14] eyes wide open because he loved her and
[1:02:18] it was type of God coming the second
[1:02:21] Adam coming to save his wife there I
[1:02:28] look what God's doing he's not letting
[1:02:31] them go on into ignorance and going on
[1:02:34] in their own mess that they've made to
[1:02:37] just keep doing this what does the
[1:02:40] second Adam what's his intention his
[1:02:42] intention is taking them back to the
[1:02:44] word back to the original you marry a
[1:02:48] wife
[1:02:49] amen she's yours
[1:02:50] is the vial to keep her is that right
[1:02:53] amen you're one flesh
[1:02:55] she's his helpmate is that high amen
[1:03:00] he's brain him back to the rest' rest
[1:03:02] restoring them back to the word not only
[1:03:05] just doctrine but health and word and
[1:03:08] marriage and this and that he's restored
[1:03:11] them all back to the original God don't
[1:03:16] want us walking in ignorance he wants us
[1:03:18] back to the word they man that's the
[1:03:23] reason we needed a prophet in this end
[1:03:24] time hallelujah amen let's turn over to
[1:03:33] Matthew 7 Jesus wasn't interested in
[1:03:41] their money Jesus wasn't just interested
[1:03:45] in their friendship Jesus wasn't
[1:03:48] interested in their churches he was
[1:03:50] interested in getting man back to the
[1:03:53] original word is that why Jesus didn't
[1:03:59] come to build a home and as far as in
[1:04:02] that house he didn't come to get married
[1:04:03] there he didn't come just to have her
[1:04:05] friendship God at the end of the Jesus's
[1:04:08] Road he says are you willing to give up
[1:04:11] your friends are you willing to die for
[1:04:14] this earth are you ready to do this
[1:04:18] Jesus was at 30 years old don't you
[1:04:21] think he was enjoying life don't you
[1:04:27] think he was enjoying a man walking
[1:04:29] around on his creation with his friends
[1:04:32] sure he was that's reason he asked God
[1:04:35] let this cup pass from me but he had to
[1:04:39] remember what was I God had me to come
[1:04:43] here for her what is my purpose church
[1:04:47] were not just here to get rich and just
[1:04:49] have fancy houses and nice cars we're
[1:04:51] here for a purpose to get a revelation
[1:04:54] of why we're here where we come from
[1:04:56] what we're hearing where we're going and
[1:05:00] we got to get that restored back to
[1:05:03] and we can't get a restored back to us
[1:05:05] unless we're hearing something that'll
[1:05:07] take us back to the beginning we don't
[1:05:09] need some of the reformists back into
[1:05:12] its tradition take us out one thing and
[1:05:14] put us back into a tradition take us out
[1:05:16] of this church and put us in another
[1:05:18] church I mean just walking with no
[1:05:20] intentions we need something that'll
[1:05:22] give us not just a partial revelation
[1:05:24] but a total revelation that restores
[1:05:27] back and say now I know now I know why
[1:05:30] I'm here for to do what God has asked me
[1:05:34] to do just hoping you're understanding
[1:05:41] we're talking about restored back to the
[1:05:43] beginning Matthew 7 Jesus gives us a
[1:05:49] word here I'm yeah Matthew 7:7
[1:05:59] he says I ask and it shall be given you
[1:06:04] seek and ye shall find knock and it
[1:06:10] shall be opened unto you for every one
[1:06:13] that asketh receiveth and he that
[1:06:16] seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh
[1:06:19] it shall be opened ma that's powerful
[1:06:24] what man in his right mind would not
[1:06:26] want that - whatever he says it comes to
[1:06:31] him that right not because he's got
[1:06:33] money but just because he asked with his
[1:06:36] mouth
[1:06:38] what he speaks amen it comes to him is
[1:06:42] that right well he asks he receives well
[1:06:46] he seeks he finds and what he knocks a
[1:06:49] man it shall be open said or what man is
[1:06:51] there of you whom his son ask bread with
[1:06:54] him giving him a stone or if he ask a
[1:06:56] fish will he give him a serpent if then
[1:06:58] being evil know how to give good gifts
[1:07:00] unto your children how much more shall
[1:07:02] your father which is in heaven give good
[1:07:04] things to them that ask him therefore
[1:07:08] all things whatsoever you would that men
[1:07:10] should do to you do even so to them for
[1:07:12] this is the law of the prophets amen so
[1:07:16] he's given them
[1:07:17] word to restore him back to like what
[1:07:19] Adam did to speak that word is that
[1:07:23] right to like maybe like Joshua had when
[1:07:27] he was needing more time to win this
[1:07:29] battle and then Joshua taps into
[1:07:32] something any men into some kind of
[1:07:35] power in some kind of desperation of a
[1:07:37] need to do something and all sudden he
[1:07:40] tells the Sun to stand still and it
[1:07:42] stops it totally stops and everybody's
[1:07:47] totally amazed here's a man that speaks
[1:07:50] the word and the Sun stand still
[1:07:52] oh that was a power of a word that Adam
[1:07:59] had in the beginning and now we finally
[1:08:02] get a man that's on the earth that can
[1:08:04] do it again but he's tapping in and he's
[1:08:07] tapping out tapping in and tapping out
[1:08:11] and we're tapping in and tapping out
[1:08:14] we're in and we're how here's Moses one
[1:08:20] time God told him to go down to that
[1:08:24] rock when they was thirsty and he said
[1:08:27] smite the rock with that rod and Moses
[1:08:31] takes the rod and he smites the rock and
[1:08:34] he gives forth water of abundance not
[1:08:39] something little hole that he could put
[1:08:41] your thumb on but this was a hole that
[1:08:45] created rivers by a smoke by being
[1:08:50] obedient what to God said by taking the
[1:08:54] rod and smote in it he's right but see
[1:08:57] God does this twice the next time God
[1:09:01] tells Moses go down and speak to the
[1:09:06] rock
[1:09:07] you know we need to listen to what God's
[1:09:10] trying to tell us
[1:09:11] sometimes God is telling us a man was
[1:09:14] something different not that his word
[1:09:17] changes but he's trying to help us to
[1:09:19] make the next step is that right amen
[1:09:23] this message has got some steps in it
[1:09:25] the church ages was seven steps Amen but
[1:09:28] when that church age last church age
[1:09:30] come amen in that pyramid
[1:09:32] we think about it in that seventh church
[1:09:34] age in the pyramid he's sitting with
[1:09:36] that seventh age was next to the
[1:09:38] prophet's chamber which had a step that
[1:09:40] nobody can make that step by himself Oh
[1:09:43] church we couldn't get out of these
[1:09:46] messes by ourself but the prophets
[1:09:49] chamber was there beside us too so that
[1:09:51] we could get help to get out of that
[1:09:53] traditional mass get out of those
[1:09:56] messed-up Lucien's and make that step
[1:09:59] out of those Church ages into a bride
[1:10:03] age we couldn't do that without a
[1:10:06] prophet church is that right so we see
[1:10:14] here lord help us that doesn't lost my
[1:10:17] father
[1:10:25] here we see Jesus is that second Adam
[1:10:29] and he's trying to restore us back so he
[1:10:33] tells Moses here we are Moses go down
[1:10:37] and speak to that rock is that right
[1:10:40] speak to the rock this time I wore Moses
[1:10:44] heard it right but listen he had a lot
[1:10:48] of frustration going on at that time he
[1:10:52] lotta had a lot of anxiety a lot of
[1:10:55] problems occurring at that time was that
[1:10:58] right I mean you know church we're
[1:11:01] standing in the same our frustrations
[1:11:04] everywhere problems here and there and
[1:11:08] coming amen

[1:11:17] troubles come along we need to find
[1:11:19] ourselves more
[1:11:20] Church than we ever have we need to be

[1:11:42] my fortress
[1:11:42] he's my street giver when troubles all
[1:11:45] around me so God tells Moses go down and
[1:11:48] speak to that wrong and all this trouble
[1:11:52] is laying on Moses his shoulders all
[1:11:54] this that he's hearing that the people's
[1:11:56] doing and he goes down to that rock and
[1:11:58] he takes out that rod and he smokes it
[1:12:00] and smokes it Oh church sometimes we

[1:14:16] and you're gonna go right into this rock
[1:14:18] and the rock was just a humongous rock
[1:14:21] and I think they called the Falls
[1:14:24] shipwreck or something like that and he
[1:14:27] said when we get around there he says
[1:14:29] there's gonna be people all over the
[1:14:30] sides of the bank and he said they're

[1:17:12] amen and I'm seeing results
[1:17:14] Amen I had car trouble other day ain't
[1:17:17] know what the wiring was messed up on it
[1:17:18] and I went out there and I spent all day
[1:17:20] on it and and so when I got done it was
[1:17:23] worse then I started I'll tell you
[1:17:33] and when I at the end of the day I like
[1:17:35] this this is really going to cost me
[1:17:38] take care of that guy to come in here
[1:17:41] not knowing where he's gonna start and
[1:17:42] fix this thing yeah you can take him
[1:17:48] days to figure out where all these wires
[1:17:50] are going as well but the next morning I
[1:17:53] was preaching in restoration restoring
[1:17:56] this back to that spoken word faith
[1:18:00] strike my heart this morning before I
[1:18:02] went out the door I grabbed my Bible and
[1:18:03] I prayed read some scriptures and in my
[1:18:07] prior said Lord I'm going out that door
[1:18:08] and I'm speaking to that car and I'm
[1:18:12] asking you God showed me where the
[1:18:14] problem is that give me the revelation
[1:18:18] to fix my car whenever I got up and as I
[1:18:22] was going out the door God says start
[1:18:25] where he left off praise the Lord God
[1:18:32] still speaks I went out there amen and I
[1:18:37] went to this little wire that was messed
[1:18:40] up and it wasn't hooked up like the
[1:18:42] other side and I had it hooked up like
[1:18:45] the other side and everything looked
[1:18:47] like you should have been hooked up but
[1:18:49] I hooked it up I unhooked it Rebekah's
[1:18:54] out there and I said start the car and
[1:18:56] it started right up
[1:18:58] I'd like this don't make sense the other
[1:19:03] side's hooked up but there was only a
[1:19:05] little black box that was in between it
[1:19:07] that somebody had lost and so I'll
[1:19:10] hooked it up like the other side bubbles
[1:19:11] bypassing the black box I hooked it back
[1:19:14] up the fuse block unhooked it started I
[1:19:19] started shouting now let me come around
[1:19:25] corners what's the matter daddy what's
[1:19:27] the matter I said praise God God spoke

[1:19:42] you shall be given it's time to get back
[1:19:44] to sons and daughters to God we had a
[1:19:47] Adams second Adam to come back and say
[1:19:50] I'm taking you back to the beginning
[1:19:52] when you shall speak not me just but you
[1:19:56] shall speak right praise the Lord
[1:20:03] amen
[1:20:07] I'm gonna go to this for just a moment
[1:20:09] you know let's go to a scripture here in
[1:20:24] the Bible here if I can find it this
[1:20:36] word well let me just read it because it
[1:20:38] might take me a minute to fund it you
[1:20:40] remember Jesus was walking one time they
[1:20:43] was on a journey and they was going to a
[1:20:46] certain place and Jesus looks down there
[1:20:49] down the road and he sees a certain tree
[1:20:51] had leaves on it he said and he was
[1:20:55] hungry
[1:20:56] he says perhaps when I get there I'll
[1:20:59] get some fruit off of it so he gets down
[1:21:01] there and there's no fruit this is the
[1:21:04] second Adam and he sees no fruit on the
[1:21:07] tree and he speaks for it and he says no
[1:21:11] man shall eat from this tree
[1:21:13] hereafter speaks it turn from it and
[1:21:18] they go on their journey and let that
[1:21:21] stop was probably said look at him he's
[1:21:23] talking to trees they go down here they
[1:21:27] go to the temple and do a few things
[1:21:29] spend a night and get up in the next
[1:21:32] morning they're coming back up and they
[1:21:36] get to the tree and Peter's Locke he
[1:21:41] said Jesus look at this tree
[1:21:44] it's withered up to the roots where you
[1:21:51] spoke yesterday
[1:21:54] right well let me take your mom back
[1:21:58] there was another tree one time the
[1:22:01] Satan tried to do the same thing and joy
[1:22:04] says there was a tree and says Satan
[1:22:07] come to that tree with these four little
[1:22:09] rum bugs and he says he began to eat on
[1:22:13] that tree he began to destroy the leaves
[1:22:16] take the fellowship from the tree take
[1:22:20] the fellowship from the church brothers
[1:22:22] and sisters you gotta have fellowship
[1:22:23] and the devil first thing he wants to do
[1:22:26] is make you mad and destroy your
[1:22:28] fellowship with one another but you'll
[1:22:31] die you've got to have that fellowship
[1:22:33] fellowship with the word fellowship with
[1:22:36] prior fellowship with church fellowship
[1:22:38] with one another and he went from the
[1:22:41] leaves to the park and all the way down
[1:22:44] trying to kill that tree he was trying
[1:22:47] to curse the tree is that right Amen I
[1:22:51] want to tell the devil he can trying he
[1:22:53] can try and all he wants to praise the
[1:22:56] Lord I mean he tried to do that to job
[1:22:58] one day he was one to cause Jo to curse
[1:23:03] God so he could die but God says you
[1:23:06] can't do it Satan you can't curse this
[1:23:09] tree devil says let me try he said you
[1:23:13] can try it
[1:23:13] and so Satan comes down and he destroys
[1:23:17] his barns he destroys amen everything of
[1:23:20] jobs got there amen a couple days he's
[1:23:23] got all of it destroyed in the fire a
[1:23:25] meaning even takes his children right
[1:23:27] and he comes before God and says he says
[1:23:35] I've done all this he says see he's a
[1:23:37] just man he said well let me have his
[1:23:40] flesh right Amen he said okay you can
[1:23:45] have it too but what he saying
[1:23:48] but don't you touch his life Satan and
[1:23:56] put balls all over his body
[1:23:58] from the head to his feet balls all over
[1:24:01] him
[1:24:02] all right he's itching he's got him all
[1:24:04] over he's got him places
[1:24:06] can't even get to maybe he's one day
[1:24:09] setting out there and he thought well
[1:24:10] aim in my wife's face to come outside
[1:24:12] with a glass of water maybe she'll get
[1:24:13] that one a niche that one for me she
[1:24:15] comes outside and looks at jokes she's
[1:24:17] like you look like a mess why don't you
[1:24:19] just curse God and die Satan he even got
[1:24:27] to his wife he said you speak like a
[1:24:32] foolish woman can you get this born into
[1:24:35] that one for me Joe wouldn't curse God
[1:24:39] and die he meant Satan was all over his
[1:24:43] flesh all over his property destroying
[1:24:46] everything Amy but God says I told you
[1:24:49] he's a just man he's a perfect man Satan
[1:24:53] tried to curse that tree but word is the
[1:24:55] life it's in the room Satan couldn't get
[1:24:59] to the root he couldn't get to the seed
[1:25:01] because the predestinated life fleas
[1:25:03] laying in there the prophet of God says
[1:25:06] I was always with God I was in his
[1:25:09] thoughts if I believe it with God
[1:25:11] eternal life then I always had eternal
[1:25:14] life
[1:25:15] st. trying to curse that life in tow but
[1:25:18] he could not touch that life but look at
[1:25:23] Jesus back up to Jesus when he cursed
[1:25:25] that tree his words went right out of
[1:25:28] his mouth into that tree straight to the
[1:25:31] root and killed the life of the tree
[1:25:36] showing you what Satan can't do and what
[1:25:40] Jesus could do as a son of God is that
[1:25:45] right
[1:25:46] Satan tried to curse Israel one time is
[1:25:50] that right he tried he got him a false
[1:25:52] prophet to go down there and look on all
[1:25:55] the mistakes of Israel
[1:25:57] look at this look what they're doing
[1:25:59] look at this putting on though all their
[1:26:02] failures and got a prophet down there to
[1:26:05] try to curse Israel and when that
[1:26:08] Prophet goes down there to curse not a
[1:26:10] little bit of changes his words he can't
[1:26:14] curse what God is blessed
[1:26:16] I don't care what they've done wrong I
[1:26:18] don't care what they're doing that's not
[1:26:20] right they could not curse what God is
[1:26:23] blessed
[1:26:26] Satan love be able to curse you and I
[1:26:29] they can might put this on you and put
[1:26:32] that on you but he can't get to the seed
[1:26:34] he can't get to the root where God is
[1:26:38] hey man God says I'll heal you of all
[1:26:41] manner diseases that means we will get
[1:26:44] some of these diseases but God shall
[1:26:47] deliver us some out of them that don't
[1:26:49] mean that we ain't gonna get them that
[1:26:50] means we're gonna get some of these but
[1:26:52] God's gonna heal us of all these things
[1:26:54] praise the Lord
[1:26:56] job had to get loosen everything but
[1:27:00] look what happened God restored job back
[1:27:05] of everything he lost and give him more
[1:27:08] is that right
[1:27:11] look at the children of Israel right
[1:27:14] after this after Moses mites the rock
[1:27:16] they're coming down to a place that they
[1:27:19] either see a hard way or see a easy way
[1:27:23] and so they went to those people and ate
[1:27:27] them whatever in the name of that place
[1:27:29] was and they said can we have permission
[1:27:31] to go this way instead of that way we
[1:27:36] won't touch your land
[1:27:38] we won't mess with your whales we won't
[1:27:41] we'll do this and they come out and says
[1:27:43] you're not gonna touch nothing you're
[1:27:45] not going through our land wouldn't give
[1:27:48] them permission that right come to
[1:27:53] another place the Moabites war ever got
[1:27:57] to the place and they asked can we go
[1:27:59] through your land and they said no you
[1:28:01] can't go through our land come out with
[1:28:03] battle and Israel with them what did
[1:28:07] they have to do they had to go across
[1:28:09] the hard way the rough side of the
[1:28:13] mountain praise the Lord
[1:28:16] sometimes we think we're gonna get
[1:28:18] through things real easy but it's not
[1:28:21] that way
[1:28:22] God don't want to scare the easy way it
[1:28:25] has to be the hard way sometimes
[1:28:28] God wanted to show them people down
[1:28:31] there that mighty army going around that
[1:28:33] big mountain while they're sitting down
[1:28:36] our second dirty and different things
[1:28:38] they seen them all men and then women
[1:28:41] with their babies and them old women
[1:28:43] going across that big mountain praise
[1:28:47] the Lord and here God was taking care of
[1:28:51] them going right through those hard
[1:28:54] mountains just like you and I we're
[1:28:56] going through those hard places hard
[1:28:59] times when we wanted to go that way but
[1:29:03] God says no you're gonna go this way
[1:29:05] because I'm gonna prove to them that
