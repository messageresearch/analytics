TRANSCRIPT
========================================
be it unto me according to thy word and in her womb a new order was born it's time for the new order to be born and that is exactly what he did in bethlehem that's exactly what he did in bethlehem of a little maiden girl who cried out in her in her thoughts of shame in her thoughts of embarrassment but her faith cried out for her be it unto me according to thy word and in her womb a new order was born something that had never been done before in the earth jesus had a blood that could be sprinkled on the conscience of the worshipper hallelujah and when that blood is sprinkled on the conscience of the worshipper he loses his sin consciousness so the guilt is gone so the condemnation is gone in fact the accusation is gone somebody said what happened to the accusation i'll tell you it got nailed to the cross every accusation against us nailed to the cross this is to bring us into a holy conscience a god conscience a word conscience instead of a sin conscience what we're saying is we get transformed out of a kingdom of darkness into a kingdom of light and therefore instead of always being aware of transgression we become more aware of forgiveness and redemption and the price being paid now why this is important is it changes the posture of our prayer because we're no longer coming as someone who has to beg for deliverance or for forgiveness but we come with a word conscience we come with a spirit conscience instead of a sin conscience so we see what the word says so if we know there's something that we need to make right the holy ghost is in us he can put his finger on it amen he can point it out does anybody still have the holy ghost does anybody still feel the pricking of the holy ghost and when you feel that conviction or that pricking of the holy ghost then you approach god but not as a beggar and not as a sinner [Music] but as a son if you know the truth if the truth has once set you free if you have accepted god's bleeding word on your behalf you don't have to beat your way back to the cross you don't have to prove yourself to the church to get back in fellowship with god all you have to do is wake up you
